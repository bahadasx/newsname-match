LOCAL INCIDENT SHOWS
SYSTEM TO BE FAULTY
Taxpayers Paper Says Ad
journed Term of Court Ex
pensive and Accomplish
ed Nothing
The April number of the New Mex
ico Tax Review, the official publication
t the Taxpayer's Association, has
just been issued and probably is the
most interesting number yet produc
ed since it shows the association in
active operation as an investigator
of public finance and administration.
The bulk of the number is the work of
Director A. E. James, who continues
his series of educational articles on
taxation and gives first results of
his inquiry into methods of conducting
stated finances.
One of the most interesting features
ef the number is a brief reference to
the grand jury system in New Mexico
with particular reference to a recent
incident in Union county. This article
is headed "A Lawyer's Game at a Tax
payers Expense of $1,107.27." The
article is in part as follows:
"The grand jury in Union county
recently returned several indictments.
The attorneys for the defendants de
murred on the ground that the jury
impaneled had been drawn after the
periods specified in the law. The in
dictments were quashed and the work
will have to be done over. This little
byplay is best explained by the fol
lowing letter from the director to the
county clerk and his replies:
"I am advised by the newspaper
statement in the Clayton newspapers
that the indictments presented by the
grand jury were quashed because of
irregularity in drawing the jury. May
I ask you to furnish me with certain
information not contained in this news
paper statement?
Q. Number of days grand jury was
in session?
A. Eight days.
Q. Number of days court was in
session before the indictments were
uashed ?
A. Seven days.
Q. Amounts paid petit jurors before
same were dismissed.
A. Petit jury was dismissed on
March 13-16 same day, before empan
eling said jury, $231.31.
Q. Amounts paid on account of
grand jury?
A. $653.31.
Q. Sheriff's fees paid or due, ser
vice of warrants, subpoenns, etc., on
account of cases dismissed?
A. He was paid for actual expenses
serving jurors, etc., $222.65.
Q. May I ask you to give me the
name and the official position of the
person to whom Judge Lieb gave the
key to the jury box?
A. Judge Lieb had the key all the
time.
Under the New Mexico system t
person suspected of crime is commit'
ted by a magistrate to the grand jury.
That jury returns an indictment after
nearing only one side, the prosecution.
Then sometime afterward the case
goes to trial. Every statutory detail
covering the selection of the grand
and petit juries must be fully carried
ut to sustain the indictment and the
conviction if one is had.
Do not criticise the lawyers. It is
their duty to protect their client in
every way possible under the law. It
is their duty to play the law game
according to the rules.
But what of the rules?
A person accused of crime has a
right to know what he is accused of.
The imlicement does that. Whether
it is framed directly by the district
attorney or indirectly through a grand
jury, is a matter of form, not sub
stance. A defendant is entitled to a
fair and open trial and to be con
fronted by .the witnesses against him.
The trial before a petit jury does that.
Why then, a grand jury? It is not
necessary to the protection of the de
fendant. It merely adds a cumber
some fifth wheel to our legal machin
ery, invites wasteful errors, occupies
the time of the district attorney, the
Bhcriff and the court and costs large
sums of the taxpayers' money. A
summary hearing before a magistrate
shorn of technicalities would supply
all necessary preliminaries, guarantee
a speedier trial and save the public
funds. Not all states require grand
juries in every case. Why not sim
plify the rules in New Mexico?
Are we so rich that we can afford
to squander money on a lawyer game ?
The defendants who got out of Un
ion county escaped only temporarily.
Their triumph is not substantial. No
thing is decided. The mill has only
ground without a grist It will grind
again, perhaps with a greater success
on a second attempt But this all costs
money to what end?

"Damaged Goods" Tonight
Manager Slats Rankin, of the Mis

ing "Damaged Goods," which comes
to his show shop for two perform
anees, tonight, that he considers the
theme of the picture one in which
every right thinking man and woman
should be vitally concerned. He, along
with folks who have read literature
commenting on the play, knows that
the subject is far from elegant but
one that strikes every person with
stunning force of the desirability of
a single standard of morals before
marriage.
Slats thinks that if all were acquaint
ed with the motive of the picture two
shows at the Mission would not be
sufficient to accomodate the crowd.

Isaacs Gets Paper Baler
Soaring prices of paper have im
pressed R. W. Isaacs sufficiently to
cause him to order a paper baler ac
cording to members of the office force.
The baler is expected here the latter
part of the week. ?Mr. Isaacs, it is
reported, will have a man who will
herd all the stray paper in town where
it can be obtained in paying quanti

Judge to Decide School Fate Monday
V
Judge Lieb after hearing the pie
for an injunction to enjoin the school
board from disposing of $35,000 worth
of school bonds decided that the board
should go ahead and receive bids on
the bonds and he will decide Mon
day whether the injunction shall be
dissolved or made perpetual.
H. B. Woodward represented the cit
izens asking that the court grant the
injunction. The controversy grew out
of several parties offering to donate
sites for the school building together
with a bonus after the school board
had contracted a site for $1800.
REPUBLICANS CONVENE
TO ELECT DELEGATES
Seventy Delegates and Guests
Listen to Pertinent Talks
of Union County's Lead
ing Citizens
The Republican convention at the
court house Monday in which 10 dele
gates were elected to represent Union
county at the state Republican con
vention at Albuquerque, was inter
spersed by many speeches that con
tained the ring of genuine confidence
for a .sweeping republican victory this
fall.
About half of the precincts had del
egates present, which is an exception
ally large turnout, considering the
enormuos size of the county and the
very busy season. A large crowd of
spectators was also present
M. J. Woods of Amistad was elected
chairman, Isidro Montoya, secretary,
M. Baca and N. F. Gallegos, inter
preters, and H. H. Errett, assistant
secretaray. The committee on cre
dentials was composed of H. J. Ham
mond, chairman, D. W. Snyder and
E. V. Gallegos. The following made
up the committee on resolutions: H.
E. Woodward, E. Sandoval, D. W.
Crow, J. Andres Pacheco, and Juan
Vigil,
Important Motion Carried
An important motion placed before
the (invention by H. II. Errett and sec

gate 'i)f each five votes, carried.
Spe.uhes were made by II. J. Ham
mond,'. W. Snyder, O. T. Toombs,
H. C; Abbott and others.
Mr. -Snyder graphically portrayed
f:hef'fUcriits as realizing inevitable
defeat. Mr. Snyder also made it known
that he was for Roosevelt.
Mr. Hammond did not talk on local
issues but took up national problems
confronting us. Mr. Hammond's talk
was very interesting, making the point
vivid that the United States needed
a man like Roosevelt at the white
house.
Andrew Knell Dead
Toombs Says Persecution Failed
Judge O. T. Toombs announced that
he favored the man the Republican
convention at Chicago nominated.
He also utilized the occasion to point
out that local "Democratic persecu

naught."
The following delegates were chosen

convention at Albuquerque:
A. McKenzie, O. T. Toombs, E. F.
Gallegos, II. J. Hammond, Juan Vigil,

Albert, has been there caring for him
since the death of his wife, last win
ter. Mr. Knell came to New Mexico

Villa Death Believed to be Fake
Sun Antonio, April 18. Gen. Bell
reporting from El Paso to General
Funston gave it his opinion, after the
thorough investigations he had made,
that the report of Villa's death had
been manufactured in Juarez.
Reports were received here today
from Mexican sources that the Amer
ican expeditionary force was being
constrained, in three places, among des
tatehments near Satevo, the main col
umn near Namiquipa and a third div
These reports also stated that the
Parral fighting had had a most un
fortunate effect on the people of north
ern Mexico, and had greatly inflamed
the anti-American feeling. The Par
ral incident, it was said, had been mag
nified by anti-American and anti-Car-
ranza agitators into a great batttle in
which the Americans were badly beaten.
The Mexican dead were accounted
for as unarmed citizens who had been
killed by "the Americans before the
Parral garrison could interfere.
The meanest editor is he of the Chi
cago Post, who is glad Villa has shav
ed off his mustache, so when it is time
to hang him he won't look so much
like Nick Longworth.

work when promised.
