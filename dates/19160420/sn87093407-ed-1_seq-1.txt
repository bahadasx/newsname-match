WASHINGTON. April
20.—Inclusion of the word
"altogether" in President
Wilson's threat of sever
ance of diplomatic rela
tions with Germany was
merely for emphasis, the
state department said to
day.
It would not indicate
the extent to which the
severance might go.
If Germany attempt* Its fa
miliar dilly-dallying tactics,
and dMi not reply te Wlleon'e
note within what He believe* la
• reasonable time. It la prob
able that the president would
hand Ambassador Von Bern
atorff hla passports, accomplish
ing the break In relations.
A break eonld be accomplished
merely by recalling Ambaaaador
Gerard.
Probably Ambassador Von Rer»-
atorff might be handed hla paaa

War Chancea Remote
Any further eventuality, Ilka a

of war between thla country and
Germany, even In rase of a sever

In answering thla question,

The greatest danger to th» t'nlt

would probably be internal.
The possibility that zealous pa

of destruction against American
lives and property has already
caused a suggestion to go forth
from Washington for a strengthen

Ultimatum Delivered

BERLIN, April 20.—President Wilton's
submarine note reached the American em
bassy at 11 a. m. today. Ambassador Ger
ard expects to give the entire note to Foreign
Minister Von Jagow this afternoon.
By Robert J. Bender
I'niud ft Cnrmi^fldfnl
WASHINGTON, April JO. For 20 minute* today Am
ba*«ador Von Bern«torff discussed with Secretary Lansing
the possibility of averting a diplomatic break between the
United State* and Germany.
The Teuton representative obtained Lansing's views on
the *teps necessary to make submarine warfare conform to
America's ideas of law and humanity.
Altho Bernstorff would not comment on the conference,
it was understood he does not take a hopeless view of the
situation.
It is known he gave Lansing reason to believe that an
other disaster similar to that which befell the Sussex will
not occur while negotiations are being conducted.
It was pointed out to Lansing that since America has
asked for a distinct change in the German submarine jK>licy.
there naturally must be numerous conferences between Berlin
officials.
United States marines have been ordered to guard the
wireless stations at Tuckerton, N. J„ and Sayville, L I
j- ThU muvc is supposedly taken, to . prutect them*from
anti-German demonstrations and to permit their seizure in
case of a break.
Much of the news from Berlin is received at the*r stations.
Von Bern*torff is obviously impressed by the administra
tion's earnestness
He has fully rej>ortcd the situation to Foreign Minister
Von Jagow in Berlin.
Germany's official reply to the note i« expected by Mon
day at the latest.
The *tate department today reiterated its contention that
Germany's present orders to submarines must be withdrawn,
and the U-boat attacks confined to warships, pending any
determination of a new plan of operation against merchant
men
This is the clear intent of the demand on Germany.
The Lansing-Bcrnstorff conference will probably deal with
how the submarine warfare should be conducted, according
to American views.
Sen. Kern, an early caller at the White House, said con
gress was not disposed to discuss the situation with Germany,
leaving President Wilson unembarrassed in handling the
crisis.
In reply to criticisms like that of Sen Gore, who said
President Wilson was risking war "because a few rash Ameri
cans insisted on traveling on armed ships," the White House
pointed out that the controversy had shifted entirely from
the armed merchantmen angle as a result of the Sussex
incident.
The Sussex was not armed, neither was it a merchant
man.
It was a passenger ferry plying on a course not taken
by merchantmen.
Among the "rash Americans" aboard were newspaper
men. a government courier, and embassy attaches, the very
nature of whose work necessitated their presence aboard under
a belligerent flag since there are no neutral vessls on which
it is possible to reach France now.
English Papers Assert U. S.
Is Facing Possibility of War
BY ED. L. KEENE
I'nttrrt fr»«« Staff Correspondent
LONDON, April 20—Well In
formed officials do not believe Ger
many will yield to the American de
mand that It cease Its present meth
od of conducting submarine war
fare. The opinion here la that a
diplomatic break Is certain, and that
war is a strong possibility.
This view Is based on the fact
that Germany lias emphasized that
the submarine la Its most effective
weapon against Great Britain.
Therefore It is believed the kaiser
cannot afford to concede anything
essential, tho he may possibly offer
certain concessions, hoping to delay
eventa.
The British attitude toward tho
president's ranges from quiet
satisfaction t™arlv to Jubilation. It
Is believed that the note Is likely to
Influence other neutrals.
"It Is difficult, to suppose the Ger
man government, elated by the sub
marine successes of the past six
weeks, will accept President Wil
son's terms," said the I tally Chron
icle, In an editorial. "Diplomatic
relations between Berlin and Wash
ington will be broken off. The re
sulting situation will not be a state
of war, but may easily develop Into
war."
Commenting on the situation tho

"The note's significance lies In

"We don't exult over the prospect
of America's entrance Into the war."
said the Manchester Guardian, "but
we do exult In the prospect of vic

manity. Whether Germany yields
or not, this victory Is sensibly
nearer."
The I/ondon Globe declared the
