MINOT LOSES A
win
W. E. TOWNER, AFTER MONTHS
OF SUFFERING, WAS CALLED
TO HIS HOME ON HIGH SATUR­
DAY MORNING.
W. E. Towner, one of the most high­
ly respected citizens of Minot, passed
away at his home Saturday morning
after a long illness from Bright's di
sease.
Funeral services were held at the
Masonic Temple Sunday afternoon at
2 o'clock, a large number of Masons
and other friends gathering. The ser­
vices at the Temple were conducted
by Star in the West Lodge No. 33, A.
F. and A. M., with Worshipful Master
Hagenstein in charge. The services
were exceedingly beautiful and im­
pressive. Rev. P. W. Erickson deliv­
ered a prayer and the male quartet of
the Presbyterian church sang a num­
ber of appropriate selections. The
.Masons marched with the body to the
G. N. station, from which place the
remains were forwarded to the old
home, Springfield, 111., for burial, Mrs.
Towner accompanying them.
The deceased was born in Scotland
and was sixty-five years of age last
August. He came to this country
when a mere boy and for nearly all
bis life was employed in some capac­
ity on the railroads. First he was a
"newsy" on the train of which his
father was conductor, and when he
reached manhood he became first a
brakeman and later, by industry and
fidelity to duty, rose to the position of
conductor on the Great Northern. He
has lived for twelve years in Minot,
and for nine years of that time, since
retiring from the service of the rail­
road, has been employed by the Con­
sumers Power Company, having
charge of its store room.
He leaves a wife and one son, Al­
bert, of his immediately family, to
mourn his death. He is also survived
by three sisters, Mrs. LaForest King
of Springfield, Illinois Mrs. R. S.
Mooney of Palatka, Florida, and Mrs.
George R. Fish, of .Chicago.
Mr. Towner led a good life. He
loved his home with its many beauti­
ful flowers and its green, well-kept
lawn. After his day's duties were
done, his greatest delight was to be
out with his wife, amid the flowers.
But a day or two before he died, he
expressed the desire to live long
enough to see the grass green once
more. He was refined in every taste,
a noble man in every sense of the
word, and by his pure life and kindly
deeds on this earth, he must have won
for himself a place in that Celestial
Home on High.
MINOT AUTO CO. SERVICE.
"Service" is a much used word and
also a much abused word.
Mr. Miller, President of the Minot
Auto Company, says that it is their
intention to make Overland Service
mean the fulfillment of the spirit as
well as the letter of their contract and
the service the Minot Auto Company
endeavors to render Overland owners,
is based on this conception of the
term.
Service means a great deal more to
an automobile owner, than one who is
not accustomed to real service may be
able to realize. The Minot Auto Com­
pany have at the present time, one ex­
pert mechanic on their staff, whose
only duties are to render service to
Overland owners and to keep them
instructed as to the proper way to
handle and take care of their cars,
as well as to assist them at any time
it may be necessary. This means a
great deal, especially to the new own­
4 "trv
er—the man who is not familiar with
the proper method to care for and
handle his machine in order to obtain
the best results.
The growing popularity of Overland
cars all over the country is due not
only to the fact that they are the
best automobile value on the market,
but also to the fact that the Overland
Company provides such efficient ser­
vice that every Overland owner will
remain absolutely satisfied with his
car and always a' booster.
BROADWAY PLAYERS
SCORE REAL SUCCESS.
The growing patronage at the Grand
Opera House this week proves that
local theatre goers of good taste are
learning the fact that the splendid
aggregation of players holding forth
at that play house are in a class by
themselves and they are demonstrat­
ing the reason that they have earned
the reputation of being the best pop­
ular priced dramatic attraction in the
west. Their plays are selected with a
view both to literary and dramatic
value and the productions have all
been highly satisfactory and really
more complete in regard to detail than
mflst higher priced attractions. They
are to remain, over three days next
week, presenting Monday night the
comedy sensation of the year, "The
Divorce Cure."
REEDER SINGER WILL ASSIST
CHORAL CLUB.
J. L. Hjort, of Reeder, who has done
much for the state in a musical way,
has kindly given his services to the
Choral Club of the First Lutheran
church and will appear as tenor solo­
ist in the rendition of The Holy City
at the church April 26 and 27. The
club will be accompanied by a full
orchestra and while no admission will
be charged, a free will offering will be
taken. The Choral Club is being di­
rected by the pastor of the church,
J. L. HJORT.
Rev. Mr. Gullixson, and those who at­
tend the entertainment will be assured
of hearing something better than the
ordinary.
Mr. Hjort is one of the state's
sweetest tenor singers. Mr. Hjort, it
will be remembered, for several years
led the Choral Club at Reeder, N. D.,
which sang The Messiah and other
difficult productions.
Mr. Hjort is spending some time
in the northwestern part of the state
in the interest of his candidacy for
Secretary of State.
A Fast Growing Store.
A big stock reducing sale at the
Minot Cloak & Suit Co., will begin
Monday. Complete announcement,
quoting tempting prices, appears in
this issue. The Minot Cloak and Suit
Co. is one of our fast growing stores
and Manager Flaten has reason to
feel proud of his success.
MINOT'S NEW HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING.
The above is a reproduction from the architect's drawing of Minot's new high school
building to be erected at an early date on the Central school grounds. Before the con­
struction can be started, it will be necessary to vote $30,000 bonds. This proposition
will be put to a vote early in June and from all indications it will carry easily. Every
bit of available space is now used and over at the Lincoln school, plans are being made to
provide for two rooms in the gymnasium. The board is even considering securing some
space in the auditorium of the public library. The plans for the new high school build­
ing were prepared by W. E. Hulse, a St. Paul architect. The building will be constructed
iq three units and when completed will be the finest high school building in North Dakota.

LIAMS TO THE CITY—ALASKA
LECTURER FACES SERIOUS
CHARGES.
M. C. Williams, aged 40 years, was
placed under arrest in a room at the
Lexington hotel Monday evening by
Chief of Police Dan Dougherty and
assistants, and is being held on the
charge of receiving money from a
prostitute. The complaint was signed
by Margaret Sanger, the woman who
accompanied Williams to this city and
with whom Williams is said to have
lived for several years.
Williams is said to be a Yale grad­
uate and a lecturer on Alaskan sub­
jects.
The fact that a fourteen-year-old
St. Paul high school girl accompanied
Williams and the Kellar woman to
Minot, led to the arrest of the couple.
Williams may later be charged with
violating the Mann act, or it is pos­
sible that he will face the charge of
being a white slaver.
Williams was tracked to Minot by
the mother of the St. Paul high school
girl, assisted by a detective. The
girl, whose name we do not care to
use on account of this being a juvenile
case, is not more than fourteen year
of age, according to the statement
made by the mother, altho she appears
to be nearly eighteen. She is a beauti­
ful child, tall and well developed. It
is said that she first met Williams in
St. Paul, as she was leaving the high
school building. She dropped her
pocketbook and Williams hastened to
pick it up. Later, Williams is said
to have taken the girl to his rooms
where he made her acquainted with
the Keller woman. Just how he man­
aged to get her to accompany him to
Minot is not known, but it is said that
he represented himself to be a man of
means and made her promises of a
tempting nature. Tickets were bought
to Poplar, Mont., but the trio got off
at Minot. The mother and the detec­
tive went to Poplar, and not finding
Williams there, telephoned to Minot
where they were located. Williams
owns a vicious Siberian wolf dog
which was checked to Williston. The
dog was returned to this city. Wil­
liams and the women arrived in Minot
Saturday night.
Williams was given a hearing be­
fore Justice C. C. C. Willis Wednes­
day. He was held to district court
under $800 and not being able to give
bail, is boarding with Sheriff Nedre
loe. Williams takes his arrest very
hard and broke down and cried.
Publishers Coming April 28.
The publishers of Ward county will
hold their convention in this city Fri­
day evening, April 28. Several of the
publishers in towns in other counties
tributary to Minot, will be invited in.
It is probable that President Hughes
of the state association and Secretary
Carlson, will be present. A banquet,
theatre parties and other forms of
entertainment, will keep the visitors
occupied, altho they will meet mainly
to transact business matters.
Thousands Visit Greenhouses.
Fully two thousand people visited
the. Valker green houses Sunday af­
ternoon. The crowd was delighted
with the countless number of plants
of all descriptions. Mr. Valker is do­
ing an immense Easter business, send­
ing plants and flowers to all sections
of the northwest.

OFFICER WARTCHOW OVERTOOK
NEGRESS OPIUM FIEND—MAN
AND WIFE HAD STOLEN
CLOTHES FROM A LINE.
After firing several shots, which
must have come uncomfortably close
to the colored damsel, and sprinting
five blocks, Officer Geo. Wartchow es­
tablished a new record for fleet-foot
edness Tuesday night when he gather­
ed in Mrs. William Jones. Mrs. Jones
is built on the long, lean, lank order
and holding her skirts high so they
would be out of the way, she present­
ed some kind of a spectacle as she ran
pell mell from her modest little shack
in the southwestern part of the city,
five blocks to a point near the Dinnie
Fats. "Yo' sure can run some fo' a
man as fat as yo' ar'she remarked
as Officer Wartchow overtook her.
George avers that the woman certain­
ly exceeded all speed limits and beat
the bullets he fired in her direction.
Chief Dougherty and Officer Wart­
chow were out looking for a lot of
clothing that had been stolen from the
clothes line at the homes of Mr. Mc
Koane and Phil Markham, who live at
Phillips Terrace. Stopping at the Wil­
son shack, they found the door bolted,
but it was thrown open after the of­
ficers had threatened to kick the door
in. The clothing was all found in the
place. A bed spread was already in
use and there were waists, skirts,
stockings and lingerie of all kinds se­
creted in a big trunk. The officers
detected the smell of opium, for this
was one of the worst coon opium
joints in the city. A big can of opium
seconds, which is the refuse left by
other smokers, and boiled down, was
found in the trunk. A part of the pipe
had been thrown in the stove and the
other part was found in the oven.
They were taken to the city jail. They
were fined $15 and if they can raise
the money, they will be allowed to de­
part from the city.
SUICIDE VICTIM HAD
VISITED MINOT
STRANGER HOLDING COPY OF
INDEPENDENT OF MARCH 30
IN HAND, SHOT HIMSELF AT
WEYBURN, SASK.
With a copy of the Ward County In­
dependent in one hand and a revolver
in the other, a stranger, who has not
yet been identified, was found dead in
a straw pile near Weyburn, Sask.,
April 9. The Mounted Police of Can­
ada have written Chief of Police
Dougherty of the affair in an effort to
identify the deceased. That the man
committed suicide is quite certain. He
shot himself thru the heart. A pic­
ture, taken after death, was sent to
Chief Dougherty, who remembers of
having seen the man in this city. He
slept two nights at the city jail. J.
F. McCoy, a Weyburn laboring man,
says he remembers having seen the
man in Minot late in March. He slept
one night at the Scofield livery barn
and told McCoy that he was troubled
with tuberculosis. The dead man ap­
pears to -have been 25 or 30 years of
ape, 5 feet and 11 inches tall, fair
hair and apparently a Scandinavian.
COLD STORAGE PLANT ASSURED.
Word has been received by the As­
sociation of Commerce officials to the
effect that the North American Stor­
age Company will erect a fine three
story plant with full basement in this
city, the building to be completed and
ready for occupancy by August first
of the present year.
The building will be located on the
triangular piece of ground directly
east of the Minot Grocery Co. build­
ing, and opposite the Soo freight
House on Central Avenue.
The first floor will be built with fine
plate glass front, and the building in
every way will be modern
The location of a real cold storage
plant in Minot has for a long time
been a great need. As it is now, but­
ter and eggs are shipped in to the
Twin Cities during the summer season
when these commodities are cheap,
and then shipped back to Minot and
adjacent territory in the winter time
when they are high in price. The
North American Storage Company
will be able to stabilize prices at all
times, thus doing away with the
great uncertainty in the market.
The location is an ideal one for the
company, and the building they will
erect will be a credit to the city in
every way.
Dr. J. R. Pence Submitted to Opera­
tion.
Dr. J. R. Pence became dangerously
ill of acute appendicitis Monday night
and an operation was performed al­
most immediately. The doctor was
slightly ill Sunday but did not suspect
that he was troubled with anything
of a serious nature. The operation re­
vealed that the appendix had ruptured
and the doctor's condition was con­
sidered very serious. He is reported
to be getting along very nicely and
he will undoubtedly be out in a few
weeks.
Rats Are Becoming Numerous.
Rats are infesting the city worse
this spring than has ever been known.
They have appeared in droves in
some parts of the city. The writer
recollects well when the first rat was
seen in Minot. The rodent was prob­
ably brot here by some immigrant.
Tame white rats were turned loose
and they have crossed with the old
variety. The result is that we have a
black and white spotted Variety here.
Dr. E. J. Walsh, a local veterinarian,
is said to have an effective method of
getting rid of the rodents, by infect­
ing one of them with bacteria, which
causes the death of the others.
Best Democratic Organization.
The democratic committee which
unanimously endorsed John Burke for
the U. S. Senate Tuesday, comprised
Halvor L. Halvorson, T. Mostad, Fred
Anderson, James Sinclair and Louis
Knudson. The Ward county demo­
cratic central committee is said to be
the best organized democratic body in
the state.
Murder Committed at Sutton.
Ed Lundmark, of Aitken, Minn.,
proprietor of a Sutton, N. D., pool
hall, was stabbed in the abdomen by
his partner, Geo. Myers, a former
Fargo man, following a fist fight. John
Sande, who lives on a farm near Sut­
ton, was stabbed in 'the abdomen, but
may recover. After a fight which oc­
curred between the proprietors, Lund­
mark and Sande walked from the
building, followed by Myers.
NEDRELOE MAY HAVE NO OP­
POSITION.
The announcement of John J. Ned
reloe, republican candidate for sher­
iff of Ward county, appears in this is­
sue. Mr. Nedreloe, so far, is without
opposition and it is probable that he
will have to make no campaign, to
speak of, in the primary. When an
official has conducted his office well the
SHERIFF JOHN J. NEDRELOE,
first term, it is generally considered
that he deserves the second. Besides,
there are few candidates who would
care to oppose Mr. Nedreloe at this
time. He proved two years ago that
he is a vote getter from the first wat­
ers.
M. O. Ofsthun Candidate for Commis­
sioner.
Martin O. Ofsthun, a prominent
farmer residing in Maryland town­
ship, is a candidate for the republican
nomination for commissioner from
the Second district.
Mr. Ofsthun has lived in that town­
ship for the past fifteen years, where
he has been very successful. He has
taken a live interest in the develop­
ment of that community. He has been
township clerk for years, was asses­
sor and for years has been president
of the Surrey Farmers' Grain Asso­
ciation, a very successful organiza­
tion.
Mr. Ofsthun has the qualifications
that go to make a good county com­
missioner. He is a graduate of the
Glenwood Academy, Minnesota. He
has proved himself honest in all of his
dealings and has the utmost confidence
and respect of all who know him. Mr.
Ofsthun is receiving many assurances
of support from various sections of
the district.
Would Foreclose on Mortgage Given
by Kenmare News.
A case of unusual interest is being
tried by Judge Leighton in chambers
this week. It is an action brot by the
Bank of Donnybrook bringing mort­
gage foreclosure proceedings on the
plant of the Kenmare News, owned by
Vic Corbett, Receiver of the Minot
landoffice. Mr. Corbett had given a
mortgage for $1500 on the plant to
the Bank of Donnybrook, signinf a
note. The figures on the note showed
the amount of $1500 but the words
written on the note were for fifteen
dollars only. Later someone wrote
in the word "hundred." Mr. Corbett
is endeavoring to evade payment of
the note on the grounds that it was
changed. A. W. Gray, who formerly
owned the Kenmare News, is one of
the witnesses for the Donnybrook
bank. Judge Palda is looking after
Mr. Corbetts' interests while the bank
is represented by J. J. Coyle of this
city and P. M. Clark of Kenmare.
Brot Back Mexican Money.
Mr. and Mrs. N. J. Coddington have
returned from a visit to Texas. They
ventured over the line into Mexico,
where they secured a bundle of the
worthless "rebel" money. Mr. Cod­
dington handed us five dollars of the
dubious long green with instructions
to mark up his subscription.

MINOT WIS
JOIIiED FORCES
STACY-JUDD AND BUGENHAGEN
FORMED PARTNERSHIP—HAVE
LARGE AMOUNT OF WORK UN­
DER WAY.
Robert B. Stacy-Judd and G. H.
Bugenhagen, well known architects,
have formed a partnership under the
firm name of Stacy-Judd & Bugen­
hagen and will continue their quarters
in the rooms of the new Jacobson
block, which have been occupied by
the former.
Mr. Stacy-Judd has been located in
this city for the past two years and
during that time he has built up a fine
business. Mr. Stacy-Judd is a man
of wide experience. He received his
training in England and worked with
some of the best firms of that coun­
try. He has also been employed in
Egypt and thruout the larger cities
of Canada.
Mr. Bugenhagen is a construction
engineer, fully qualified in Canada
and California, having passed the ex­
aminations required for provincial and
state licenses. He was located at Sas­
katoon, Sask., for five years.
Joining their forces will give the
architects an opportunity to go after
more of the larger deals. They will
specialize in steel and reinforced con­
crete work.
Five architects are now employed
at the office where all of the designing
is done. One of the architects is a
specialist in steel work, who does
nothing else.
They are now working out plans
covering $250,000 worth of work.
It will be remembered that the Wil­
liston Armory, designed by Mr. Stacy
Judd, was let for $24 less than the ar­
chitect's estimate and that for the new
.$80,000 Williston flat block the con­
tract was let for $50 less than the es­
timate.
The concern is working on plans for
a $40,000 fireproof block of flats at
Bismarck, a large Catholic church in
the southern part of the state, and
other flats and office blocks scattered
about the state.
FAUCHALD WILL
TA
4-STORY BLOCK
WILL SOON START CONSTRUC­
TION OF IMMENSE BUILDING
AT CORNER OF CENTRAL AVE­
NUE AND FIRST ST. S. E.
Julius Fauchald has returned from
New York City, where he spent sev­
eral weeks with his family, who will
return to the city early in June, at the
close of the schools in that city.
Mr. Fauchald will soon start the
construction of an immense four-story
block, which may not be completed
this year. The building will be 150
feet long, built L-shape. The first
floor and basement will be occupied by
the New York Furniture and Hard­
ware store. The second and third
noors w.ll be built for apartments,
while the fourth floor will be used for
storage.
Mr. Fauchald says that conditions
are flourishing in the east. Hundreds
of thousands of men are getting high
wages ir. the munitions factories, but
after the war is over, they will have
to find new jobs. Mr. Fauchald says
the impression prevails in the east
that the war cannot last longer than
the first of the year.

Managers Met in Minneapolis.
W. E. Borene, manager of the M.
G. Olson & Co. clothing store, return­
ed from Minneapolis, where he at­
tended a gathering of the managers of
the eleven M. G. Olson stores located
thruout the west. The managers met
a number of eastern salesmen ii* the
city and were thus saved a long east­
ern journey. The M. G. Olson store in
Minot is doing a remarkably nice bus­
iness, showing a substantial gain from
week to week.
An accident that might have proven
fatal occurred at the Rev. Mellom
home, one mile north of Ruso. Mr.
Mellom with his six year old son went
out to hunt gophers. When Mr. Mel­
lom shot at a gopher the bullet glanc­
ed and hit the little fellow near the
eye, plowing its way through the
outside of the skull bone and coming
out by the ear.
