IS A CANDIDATE
FOR RE-ELECTION
Walter G. Taylor, Commissioner of In
surance, Announces His Candidacy
And Platform.
Bismarck, N. D., April 12—W. C:
Taylor today formally announced his
candidacy for re-election to the office
of commissioner of insurance, as fol
lows:
To the Republian Electors of the
:-T
State of North Dakota: am a can
didate for the office of commissioner of
insurance. I am now serving my third
term in that office, and my candidacy
is submitted on the ground of efficient
service, faithful attention to dmy, and
a desire to further assist in placing
the entire struction of insurance on a
more substantial basis in this stater
The program I have in mind calls for
the enactment of a complete and har
monious insurance code, to take the
place of the the hodge-podge of laws,
many of them more or less contradict
ory, which have been enacted from
time to time since statehood.
The state should have supervision
of insurance rates as well as of the
insurance companies authorized to
transaat business therein. This ap
plies with special force to tire insur
ance rates, but I believe it should also
be extended to provide regulation of
rates charged by surety companies.
Insurance is a public necessity, no
less than railroad, telegraph and tele
phone systems. Even more intimate
ly than any of these utilities it enters
into the very woof and warp of our
social and industrial fabric. It was in
recognition of this fact that the United
States- supreme court recently said
that "the business of fire insurance is
so far affected with a public interest
as to justify legislative regulation of
rates." If re-elected I shall renew the
efforts which were inaugurate in the
last legislature to secure supervision
of rates.
Life insurance is written either on
what is known as the "legal reserve
basis" ov the "assessment plan." So
far as assessment life insurance is
concerned, I believe its writing should
be confined exclusively to fraternal
benefit societies, and no adequate
rates. There would not seem to be
any legitimate reason or demand for
assessment life associations, and this
state might well follow the example of
tother states in expressly excluding
them from its borders. Certainly the
present lack of definition in that par
ticular should be corrected.
Demands upon the time and atten
tion of the commissioner of insurance
in examining disputed claims for in
demnity, under politics of accident
-and health insurance, has grown
alarmingly. This is due to the vague,
indefinite and misleading character of
these contracts. Stnndard forms should
be prescribed by the legislature enact
ment, as in the case of lire insurance
and life insurance.
The state department of insurance is
not merely or primarily a recording
office. The duties developing upon the
commissioner of insurance are highly
technical, and call for an intimate
knowledge of the insurance laws and
at least a reasonable degree of admin
istrative ability. These qualifications
can be acquired, if at all, only by ex
perience. In this connection attention
is called to the fact that in addition to
the steadily increasing amout of work
developing upon this office as a result
of the rapid growth of the insurance
business, the responsibity and labors
of the commissioner of insurance have
been immeasurably enlarged from the
fact that he has been charged with
supervision of the state hail insurance
fund, the fire marshall fund and the
state bonding fund. It is true, that
the law creating the state bonding fund
is not in operation at the present, but
it is likely to become effective within
a short time.
The state.of North Dakota owes me
nothing. On the contrary I am deeply
indebted to the people of this state
and in that spirt—in the desire to give
better service to our people than it
has been the possible for me to give
in the past—my eandidacy is sub
mitted.

On the Subject of
Commercial Integrity
THE REO FOLKS BELIEVE have always believed and from
the first have based the Reo Policy on the belief—that ulti
mate supremacy in the automobile industry will redound to
that concern that has most scrupulously fulfilled its obliga
tions to its customers.
IT MATTERS NO! whether those obligations are assumed in
writing or merely implied in transactions as between man
and Inan—the Reo Folk hold them sacred.
IF THERE IS ANY REASON—
aside from the inherent quali
ty and value of Reo cars—for the splendid Reo suocess, it
is to be found in the reputation the Reo has for making
good its guarantees.
OF COURSE YOU KNOW—aU the world knows—that the Reo
Motor Car Company is financially one of the strongest au
tomobile companies in the world.
AND YOU KNOW that it is also one of the pioneers in the in
dustry—so that financial strength is not due-to lucky chance,
nor to a brief period of prosperity.
REO STANDING- financially and in the heart of buyers—is
the result of a policy firmly founded in the beginning.and.
consintently carried out through along period of yearsi
BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT MATTER if the heart of the
Reo were not sound.
IT WOULD NOT MATTER how much money there was back
of the Reo guarantee if there were not also Reo Integrity
and Reo Good Intent.
THAT IS WHY, knowing the Reo Folk and their ideals, you
will feel safer in selecting a Reo than any other car of simi
lar size or price class.
SPEAKING OF SIZE— do you realize what a big, as well as
beautiful car is that New Reo Six?

Barnes Counties where we are operating, Now is
the time to list while we are here. We may be op
erating many miles from here by next year.
