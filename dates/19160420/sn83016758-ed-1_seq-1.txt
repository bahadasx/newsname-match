SPELLIMJMTEST
Princeton Wins Over Elk River in
Oral and Written Contests at
Armory Friday Evening.
Miss Frances Blocker of Princeton is
the Individual Champion Speller
of the Two Schools.
Princeton orthographers again dem
onstrated their superiority over Elk
River spellers at the Armory Friday
evening, when pupils from the eighth
grades of these two schools opposed
each other.
A brief but pleasing musical pro
gram preceded the contest, and the
large audience in attendance enjoyed
every number. The high school or
chestra, under the leadership of Chas.
Umbehocker, favored those present
with several selections well rendered,
and a trombone solo by Allen Ross
was well received. The chorus, un
der the direction of Miss Robarge,
elicited generous applause also.
Twelve pupils from each of the
schools participated in the contest,
and a written test was given first.
Pri aceton easily won, the visitors hav
ing 76 misspelled words to 46 on the
part of the locals. The oral contest
then started with Mrs. M. B. Hixon,
the popular Isanti county superintend
ent of schools, reading the words, and
it was evident to those in attendance
that it was merely a question of how
many Princeton spellers would sur
vive the downfall of the visiting class.
Finally only one of the Elk River
representativesFlorence Nordwas
in the contest, her companions hav
ing been forced to retire after spell
ing not in accordance with Webster's
unabridged. In a short time Miss
Nord joined her classmates on the re
tired list, and six Princeton represen
tatives remained. The contest was
continued to determine the individual
champion of the two schools, and Miss
Frances Blocker carried off the hon
ors, while Miss Ida Henschel was sec
ond.
Misses King and Robarge, the local
eighth grade instructors, are deserv
ing of commendation for the splendid
showing made by their pupils, and it
is to be hoped that other contests
will be arranged for in the future. A
taste for correct orthography is de
veloped, and a deeper interest in a
much neglected subject is aroused by
these contests while the memory of
the participants is also strengthened.
The Money Value of Good Roads
As the result of the study of 650
farms in Johnson county, Missouri, by
the State Experiment Station, inter
esting evidence of the money value of
good roads to the farmer was adduced.
The investigation was for the purpose
of determining the relative importance
of crop yield and location in fixing
farm values. The Experiment Station
concludes that location is more import
ant than yield as a factor in values.
The figures on which it bases this con
clusion are:
Seventy-nine farms within two miles
of market averaged $78.70 an acre
183 farms, two to four miles from
market, $70.20 an acre 126 farms,
four to six miles from market $60.90
an acre 113 farms, six to eight miles,
$58.20 149 farms, over eight miles
from market, averaged $55.90 an acre.
While the matter of roads did not
directly enter into the investigation,
an analysis of the findings shows them
to be a strong argument for improved
highways. For, in essence, a good
road is simply shortening of distance.
A farm with good road connections is
really for practical purposes, that
much closer to market than one on a
bad road, whether you figure in time
used, power consumed or wear and
tear, to say nothing of the periods in
which one is impassable. In estimat
ing location as a factor in farm val
ues, road conditions are a vital essen
tial in the calculation.Minneapolis
Journal.
Another Good Roads Dunn.
Mr. William Dunn, treasurer of Col
umbia county, Wisconsin, was a visitor
at the home of his uncle, R. C. Dunn,
over Sunday. Mr. Dunn is also assist
ant highway commissioner of Colum
bia county and is greatly interested
in road-improvement. In the past five
years, he says, 50 miles of macadam
ized roads have been constructed in
Columbia county. There as here,
-there are benighted individuals who
antagonize modern methods of road
improvement, but the great bulk of
the people are behind the movement
for better roads, and the mileage of
permanently improved roads win con
tinue to increase annually. Mr. Dunn
is an admirer of Senator LaFollette
and he believes that gentleman will
continue to be a big factor in the poli
tics of the Badger str.te for years to
come. Superintendent of Schools Appointed.
The school board has selected a
successor to Superintendent Marshall,
who declined to consider re-appoint
ment, and Prof. W. H. Holland of
Stillwater will head the Princeton
schools beginning next year. The board
considered the applications of about
20 educators, eight of whom applied
in person, before arriving at a deci
sion in the matter, and carefully
weighed the qualifications of each.
Mr. Holland has served as superin
tendent of the Stillwater schools for
eight years and comes highly recom
mended as an educator of natural abil
ity ripened by wide experience. His
contract calls for a compensation of
$1,900 per year, which is $150 more
than has been paid Superintendent
Marshall.
Mr. Marshall expects to retire from
the teaching profession, and reside on
his fruit ranch near Yakima, Wash
ington. He has served as superintend
ent of the Princeton schools for nine
years, and has labored hard for the
advancement of same.
All of the teachers have accepted
re-appointment with the exceptions of
Misses Mulrean and Hoehn of Brick
ton and Miss Huse of Princeton.
Miss Huse will retire on her
teacher's pension, and her place will
indeed be difficult to fill. She has been
particularly successful as an instruc
tor of the little folks, and her retire
ment will be regretted by residents of
the district having children to be en
rolled in her room. She has earned a
long vacation, however, and all hope
that a pleasant future is in store for
her.
The school board will fill these three
vacancies at a later date.
The Class of 1916.
The largest graduating class in the
history of the Princeton schools will
hold its commencement exercises at
the Armory on Friday evening, June
30. The class of 1916 numbers 32 pu-
pils24 girls and eig)it bpvs TJje
girls excelled in scholarship ana^tne
class honors were awarded to the fair
sex. Miss Myrtle Nelson heads the
class with a percentage of 89.58 for
the four years' course, and she will
be the valedictorian. The salutator
ian will be Miss Florence Slater, who
was a close second to Miss Nelson,
with a standing of 89.18. Third hon
ors in scholarship go to Miss Alba
Svarry, whose markings averaged
88.86.
Twelve of the graduates are from
the Normal department, and some of
these have completed the regular four
year course.
The commencement address will be
delivered by Dr. George E. Vincent,
president of the University of Minne
sota, and a real treat is in store for
those who attend. Dr. Vincent is keen,
able and bright, and is a speaker of
far more than ordinary ability.
Rev. Samuel Johnson of the Prince
ton Congregational church will de
liver the' baccalaureate sermon at the
Armory, Sunday evening, June 25.
Jacob Knutson.
Jacob Knutson, a respected Blue
Hill, Sherburne county farmer, depart'
ed this life at the Northwestern hos
pital Saturday morning. Heart trou
ble caused death. Mr. Knutson had
been ailing for some time, but his
condition became more serious a few
weeks ago and all efforts to effect a
cured proved futile.
Funeral services were conducted
from the family residence Tuesday
afternoon and interment was in .the
Blue Hill cemetery. 5
Jacob Knutjson was a native of
Norway, and at the time of his de
mise was 56 years, five months and 21
days old. He had been a resident of
this country 33 years, and Blue Hill
has been his home during' practically
all of that time. He was a good citi
zen in every sense of the word, and
had the confidence and esteem of all
who formed his acquaintance. He is
survived by the widow, five sons and
three daughters. .$
Thanks, Brainerd Boosters.
J&t a meeting of the Brainerd Boos
ter Club last Friday evening the fol
lowing resolutions were unanimously
adopted:
Resolved, That this club severely
criticises and condemns the actions
of the aforesaid so-called Minnesota
Highway Home Rule association in
its endeavors to create sentiment in
favor of the abolishment of the State
Highway commission in order that the
members of said association, said to
be composed of bridge contractors,
can deal directly with the smaller
subdivisions of the state without be-
ing compelled to conform to the spec
ifications heretofore laid down by the
Highway commission for state high
way work. That we express our ap
preciation for the good work done by
the Hon. R. C. Dunn, father of the
so-called Dunn Good Roads law, in
his unceasing efforts to further the
cause of good roads, and
Resolved Further, That a copy of
this resolution be mailed to each
town clerk in this county, to the
county board, to the Hon. R. C. Dunn
and Hon. C. W. Bouck, chairmen re
spectively of Senate and House roads
and bridges committees, to the Cuy
une Range Good Roads association,
all newspapers in Crow Wing county
and the members of the State Highway
commission.
Macdonald is Astounded.
There occasionally comes times in
the life of an editor when he finds it
impossible to express his feejing^
over some amazing occurrence or
passing event. SucK* an occasion pre
sents itself to the editor of the Times
today. There are no words in our
vocabularly which would enable us to
give vent to the astonishment and
wonder which fills our mind in con
templating the result of yesterday's
election!
A city of 13,000 people, with annual
expenditures of a quarter of a million
dollars, elects as one of its three
commissioners a man who has been all
his life a teamster, absolutely with
out business experience and very lim
ited education. Another as commis
sioner who is practically a boy in
years, absolutely without business ex
perience, and lacking in the sound
judgment necessary in the manage
ment of the affairs of a growing city!
Is it any wonder that the editor's
amazement precludes the utterance of
words. Emerson said: "The gods
themselves battle in vain with stu
pidity!"St. Cloud Times.
Plowing Up Public Highways.
By resolution the county commis
sioners of Stearns county have re
quested and directed the county attor
ney of that county to institute pro
ceedings against parties who plow up
parts of the public roads adjoining
their fields. Any person living upon
or owning land fronting on a public
road, a portion of which is not in
jatfjial usejor^needed for public travel,
may plow, level and seed -ffie samefS'
grass, except within one rod of the
center. Any person who shall plow
or dig up any part of a road, except
as above specified, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. It is made the duty of
the county attorney to prosecute all
violations of this section of the road
law occurring within his county.
Five Miles an Hour is Jim's Gait.
Our old friend, James A. Peterson,
and his son, James D., are joint de
fendants in an action for damages in
the amount of $9,363, brought by
Weseley Ames and wife for alleged
injuries last 5th of July on the road
between Osseo and Champlin, when
the Peterson automobile collided with
the Ames buggy. We can testify that
Jim would not willingly ride in any
vehicle that was propelled at a great
er velocity than five miles an hour.
The charge of fast driving will not
stick against him. Something else is
responsible for the damage suit.
County Board of Audit Meets,
The county board of audit, consist
ing of F. C. Cater, chairman of the
board of county commissioners, Coun
ty-Auditor Doane and Clerk of Court
King, has been in session at the court
house since Monday. This is the first
meeting of the audit board this year,
and two other meetings will be held
before the close of 1916. The total
receipts of the treasurer's office from
date of the last meeting are being
compared with the disbursements dur
ing that period, and the cash on hand.
Brick Yard to Open.
The Cream Brick Co., will begin
the operation of its Brickton yard in
a week or two, and the other yard will
commence operations as soon as some
new machinery is installed. The first
named yard expects to turn out a full
season's run, and as 4,000,000 bricks
were baked there last year it is ex
pected that even more will be manu
factured th coming summer. It is
safe to say that the two yards will
turn out 7,000,000 bricks this season.
Isle Farmers WakingUp.
Farmers in the vicinity of Isle, in the
northeast corner of the county, are
alive to the fact dairy farming can be
made profitable. They have organized
a co-operative creamery and a concrete
building will be erected as soon as the
weather conditions permit. Arrange
ments have been made for the distribu
tion of several cars of milch cows. In
the neighborhood of 700 cows have
been pledged to the creamery.

Holy Week Services at St. Edward's.
Holy Week commemorates two his
toric'events: Christ's institution of the
blessed sacrament of the altar on
Holy Thursday, when He celebrated
with the Apostles the first Mass that
was ever said, commissioning the 12
to continue the same till the end of
time. On Good Friday we recall the
suffering and death of the Saviour on
the Cross on Calvary's Mount for the
redemption and salvation of man.
Both events the church celebrates by
special religious exercises. The serv
ices are as follows:
On Holy Thursday high mass and
Procession of the Blessed Sacrament.
at 10 o'clock. At 7:30 in the evening
adoration rosary and sermon on the
hidden God.
On Good Friday, the services take
on the character of mourning. Mass
of the Pre-sanctified, unveiling of the
cross and kissing by the faithful of
the bleeding figure thereon. At 7:30
way of the cross, reading of Christ's
passion from the gospel and sermon
on the seven words Christ uttered
while suspended from the cross.
On Holy Saturday, blessing of the
Easter Candle and Holy Water will
take place at ,9 o'clock.
Easter"* commemorates the trium
phant resurrection of Christ proving
thereby His divinity and power over
life and death. The services are most
solemn, the church edifice is decorated
with flowers and trees.

Hen Lays Little After Third Year.
Old hens are the cause of low
averages in egg production. The pul
lets work regularly, a Chicago farm
paper says, but the old hens lay about
a dozen eggs and rest the remainder
of the year.
Unless you are raising a particular
y~j? "tor* -S.3?""',
r?t*-'~ n,Ts ft.'w'J
stock of chickens of whl
only a few hens, you cannot afford to
keep the old hens as layers. A hen is
not profitable after her third summer
as a layer. Selling the old hens and
using the incubator for hatching is
the best plan for the small poultry
man.
Fourth of July Celebration.
Many people in the vicinity of
Princeton are anxious that the village
people get up a good, old-fashioned
Fourth of July celebration this year.
At a meeting of the Fair Board on
Tuesday the matter was informally
discussed. If a celebration here would
not conflict with plans of any
of the surrounding towns the sen
timent seemed to be in favor of
holding a celebration. If one is held
it will be a good one as was evidenced
by the fact that $100 was pledged by
those present, and it was thought that
$400 additional could be easily se
cured. The idea is to have a big pa
rade in the morning down town togeth
er with speaking and patriotic songs,
while in the afternoon there would be
an attractive program of sports at the
fair grounds, including daylight fire
works, and a big display of fireworks
in the evening.
