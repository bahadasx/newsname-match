A meeting of the board of dir
ectors of the Commercial club
was held April 7th at the Park
hotel at 6:15 p. m. to receive the
report of the secretary relative
to action taken at the annual
meeting of the Duluth-Huron and
S. W. R. R. held at Wahpeton,
April 4th.
The secrelary presented the re
solution adopted at the Meeting
of March 23rd, to the effect that
the territory crossed by the pro
posed li«e from Sisseton to Per
ham would undertake to raise ap
proximately $1500,000 if that
route were taken. He also ad
vanced the argument that this
route was shorter and more di
rect that it passes through a
territory with greater population
and One that would and does have
much greater productive powers
than the other. That it was a
country that could easily be built
through and that Fergus Falls
already possessed a survey with
complete profiles, etc. offering a
good basis to justify the considera
tion of the proposition that
most of the line would be of easy
construction while at least a pail
of the second route offered very
difficult territory through which
to build.
The officers of the company
said that the city had had a
chance to get the road, that their
representatives came to this city
last summer and asked for the
Commercial 'club but were in
formed that there was no such
organization. They then at
tempted to place their proposi
tion before men of town hot did
not meet with encouragement and
left the iily without further
ef­,lions

I he proposition was then ^g

At this meeting plans for en
tertaining the Sfavanger Lagt
which comes here in June and for
considering a Commission form
of government were also consid
ered.—Fergus Falls Wheelock's

CORN CONTEST
We would like to call attention
to the Boys' Corn-Ornwine contest
Announcement of this conest has
already been made thru fhe Bul
letins for March and April. The
response has not been as encour
aging as we had hoped and we sus
pect this is partly due to fhe fact
that seed was nof to be furnised.
This, together with the scarcity
of seed, may have led some of the
hoys to feH discouraged about en
tering the contest.

Many suggestions have been offer

while if the public or bus system
is used, it will average $35.70 per
pupil per year. In several of the
schools in other parts of the state
the private system is the one used
because it gives there the greatest,
satisfaction. In some, the combi
nation of the two systems is used
with much success while some
prefer the public or bus system.
There are now consolidated
schools iu the state, all counties
being represented but one. Of
this number 123 are open country
consolidated schools and 210 are
town consolidated. Four years ago
last June there were 114 consoli
dated schools. This means au in
crease of over 200 during this
period, being the greatest increase
in the history of the stale. This is
due largely to the state aid grant
and the educational campaign
that has been carried on to pro
mote their growth.
There is only one consolidated
school in Richland county and
that is Sheyenne. It has proven
successful there and we advise all
districts that are going to build
new schoolliotises this year or in
the future to look into the matter
