No town in the country has as

sewer system as Baxter Springs.
The sewer system must be put in.
Mine Host Todd of the Hotel
Baxter was 64 years old Sunday.
He acted just like a yearling colt
all day, and showed all the guests
a good time.
When the roads are the west
is when corn and bay are highest
in price; and without good roads
to market the producer of the hay
and corn cannot get the benefit
of the high price. Isn't this true?
We asked a man from Chicago
the other day if he were going to
move his family here. (He is in
terested in the mines here.) He
aid he would just as soon as a
sewer system is put in. And he
it of the same mind as hundreds
of others. ,
We have been assured that just
is soon as the weather will per
mit the road leading from the
end of the new gravel road to
Picher will be completed. Also
that the road from Baxter Springs
to Sannyside will be put in first
class condition, and that the road
from the corner south of the Red
eagle mine to Lincolnville will
be graded and graveled.

Go In And Sit Down.
What are yon going to do Eas
ter Sunday?
Go into a church and sit down.
Stay sit until the end of the ser
vice and keep your ears open and
your mind on what the preacher
is saying. Then go homeland
think over what be had to say.
Don't give his words just a pass
ing thought and then let your
mind settle back in the old finan
cial groove.
Take his discourse subject by
subject and analyze it thoroughly.
Pick out the good points and
study them minutely as you dis
cover them. You can spend sev
eral hours very pleasantly in this
work, and at the end of that time
you may be amazed at the feeling
of peace and contentment that
pervades your being.
You will find that there are
many things you knew that had
been forgotten for these many
years, and when they pass from
memory their value practically
ceases to exist.
Go to church Easter!
Set an example to the young
people of your family and of
other people's families. Let them
judge you by what you are, and
not by what others may have to
say of you. Let your own actions
afford them the opportunity for so
judging.
There's a church around the
corner, and the door swings out
ward to every human being. The
hand of welcome beckons to you,
and the still voice of conscience
is calling to you.
Go in, and sit down, and listen,
and think, and then act.
Beautiful Home Sold
Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Abrams
have sold their beautiful home
just north of town to Mrs. Blanche
Bilbarz of Saint Louis.
The home comprises a fine mod-
em bouse and twenty acres oi
land. Willow creek, a stream
which always runs, flows through
the place, and there is fine fishing
and bathing and boating.
Mr. Bilharz is a St. Louis
banker, and is interested in the
company named after him, which
is operating on the Cooper and
Goodwin land, southwest of this
city.
The W. R. C. will give a bake
Saturday at Mrs. Palmer's milli
nery. Three or four room houses in
Baxter Springs will pay from 25
to 30 per cent on the investment.
Who will build a number this
spring?
Wanted two or three hustling
solicitors who possess ability and
energy to work on salary or com
mission. Steady work. Address
A. C. Snelson, Baxter Springs,
or Galena, Kansas.
Jim Goodwin, John I. Cooper
and Fred Goodwin went fishing
Wednesday. They captured 102
fine fish, mostly bass and crappie
Tell a better one, if you can
But they got the fish, all right.
The Reciprocity Club met with
Mrs. W. T. Hartley last Friday.

lework. Mrs. Hartley's guests

Park Hartley, Mrs. Jack Foster,
Mrs. Leonard Tuthill and Mrs.
Harry Hartley.
The road leading from here to
Picher is good so far as the gra
vel has been put on, but there is
a two-mile stretch that has not
been graveled yet, and this two-
mile stretch is almost impassable.
One man who is in business at
Picher says Baxter Springs is los
in five hundred dollars' worth
of business every week because
of the condition of that short
length of road.

A new sidewalk campaign is
being talked of. A lot of walks
are needed to connect some of
the main line walks in the town.
And no better time to build them
will ever be found than this
spring.
About twenty new houses have
been built in Baxter Springs so
ar this spring, and about ten
times that number will be needed
soon, f ully ntty nouses couia
be rented within a week, and the
demand is constantly increasing.
A wedding, is scheduled to take
place out in the country before
long. No, we won't say who, or
in what direction, but we will
say that the young man is going
to be fortunate to get so fine a
young woman. He is a worthy
young man, however. ,
We know of a number of rich
drill strikes whicn have been
made lately, and within two
miles of town, but we are not at
liberty at this time to tell about
them, and if we should tell the
people would simply go wild,
and we understand the asylums
are already crowded.
Just as soon as the weather
will permit the road leading south
from Scott Jarrett's corner to the
gravel road running from Picher
must be graveled. The road is
now impassable. There are only
two miles of road between Baxter
Springs and Picher not graveled,
and the lack of this gravel is
costing Baxter Springs more than
five hundred dollars a week.
One of the most disgraceful
madholes we ever saw, and there
is absolutely no excuse for it, is
just on the east side of the M. O.
& G. trestle on west South street.
The hole has been worn out in
the aide of the hill, iust where it
could be easily drained, and has
made a hole which would make a
river bottom mudhole ashamed of
itself. Three or four loads of
rock and gravel, which, by the
way, is within easy shoveling
distance, would fix the place. As
it is, all travel from the west
most stick in that hole.
COUNTY, KANSAS. APRIL
In Cupid's Net.
The culmination of one of
cupid's schemes to enmesh tbei
. - e !
nearia oi two oi our udc tqudk
people occurred last Saturday
morning at ten o'clock, when J.
W. Twente of this city and Miss
Petrea Newcomer of Galena were
united in marriage by the Rev.
Bradshaw of the Christian church
at bis home in Columbus.
The marriage was in the na
ture of a surprise to some, but
not to the writer, who is a close
observer, and had noted the
symptoms.
The bride is the charming
daughter of Mrs. Petrea New
comer of Galena, and she has
been and is one of the teachers
of the Baxter schools. When
she failed to make application
for a school next term we made
up our mind that something was
about to happen.
The groom is from Belton,
Mo., and has been superinten
dent of the Baxter schools for
several years. He has placed
the schools on a firm basis, and
has made good in every way.
We are glad to note that the
young couple will make their
home in this city.
When Prof. Twente and his
bride appeared at the high school
building Monday morning there
was such a hearty reception from
the kids that it was found neces
sary to adjourn school for the
day, for the very simple reason
that the pupils insisted on one
continuous reception, a way kin,
have, you know, when they want
to win a point.
In the evening a lot of the
school kids joined with a num
ber of friends of the couple, and
securing a rig they placed the
couple in it and made a parade
of the main business section.
Prof. Twente and his bride made
a speecn, and took the lead so
heartily that they had as much
fun as the fun makers.
The News congratulates the
young couple, singly and collec
tively. Miss Tulsa Barnes was borne
from Oswego College for the week
end.
Miss Norma Baldwin of Joplin
spent Sunday here with her par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. O. N. Baldwin.
In spite of upset market condi
tions, advances in cotton and
dyestuffs, we still have the heavy
overall for $1, heavy work shirts
50c: shoes, clothing and the bulk
of our stock is unchanged, owing
to heavy future buying. Baxter
Supply Co., next to Postoffice.
Last week was a record break
er for the lead and zinc district,
of which Baxter Springs is a
very important part and spot
The total sales of ore for the
week amounted to about twelve
hundred thousand dollars, and
as high as $125 per ton was paid
for zinc ore. '
We have just learned tnat a
determined effort is going to be
made to have a sewer system in
stalled in this city. There are
two ways to get it. One is for
the citv administration to take
the initiative, as will be done.
Another is for a delegation to
aslc the state board of health to
make the order, which also can
be done. However, we are glad
to note that the latter plan will
not have to be resorted to.
H. Harris of Kansas City and
Chas. Neusbaum of Cincinatti,
Ohio, were here the latter part
of last week looking after their
mining interests. They are own
era of the land on which the old
Ktv mine is located. They are
arranging a campaign for some
deep drilling on the land. The
upper run of ore is good, bo they
are convinced, as is almost every
body else, that richer and deeper
ore will be found.

The Dividing Line
"I WISH" will only take you to the far
side of the land of Desire. It is the strong, act
ive "I WILL" that carries you across the divid
ing line and over into the realm of Attainment.
An active, purposeful "I WILL is the
Herald of actual accomplishment. It is the
men and women who say "I will have money to
pjotect my family and furnish old age comforts
and at once begin to systematically save the
odds and ends of their income, building them
into a lump sum, that find their desire gratified.
The determination to succeed spurs them on to
greater effort Opportunities to accumulate
come to them that never come to the thriftless
spender.
Stop wishing. Start to accumulate. If you
go aj it systematically it will surprise you how
quickly small Bums combine into one worth
while.
No other plan for systematic accumulation
is so good, so safe, so sure in ultimate results as

We can't keep from growing old. It's inevitable if

and that's a needy and dependent old age. If careful saving
