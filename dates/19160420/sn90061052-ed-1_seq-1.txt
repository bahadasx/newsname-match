In one hole three small loads ofhay
were dumped and 12 loads pf rock and
100 loads of gravel were also spread
along the road Borne grading was
also done
Desldes the farmers In the vicinity
the following Jasper men gave their
services Bert Webb W C Thomas
and one man O L7 Hayzlett and one
man and team L T McCune ii 0
Cordz and It E Cearnal Each of the
following employed a man on the job
Dr Schooler O E Hoberts and Dr
Knott
Oood roads interest Is as prevalent
as the measles in this vicinity and by
the time the winter season comes again
a bad piece of road in the community
will be the unusual tiling
Just remember that every piece of
road made right Is an investment that
pays n continual dividend into the
pockets of the community andwell as
the comfort It gives the trtivelers
Gets Credit from Headquarters
When the Junior JasperCarthage
Jeilcrson Highway Club whs formed
some weeks ago the enterprise and
progressive spirit of the women and
children composing It made a deep Im
pression on everyone who knew of It
The territory along the highway from
Jasper to Carthage has been divided
Into Jour sections and n a committee
m eaelrsectioriappoHitedi Their ob
ject is to encourage in everyway they
can the building of the road and par
ticularly to interest residents along
the way in beautifying premises that
abut on the roadway
They have interested the teachers
and pupils of the schools in the work
aiul last week the Carytown School
received from a school over In the Oz
ark Hills a bundle of young forest trees
which they planted and nre looking
after
General Manager J D Clarkson of
the Jeirerson Highway who visited
Cartliage last week had the following
to say about the juniors
In the territory between Jasper and
and Carthage has been organized the
first Womans Jeilcrson Highway As
sociation as an auxiliary for helping
the highway along Their action has
come as a surprise t headquarters In
Des Moines Iowa and has been an in
spiration It probably willmean that
many such associations will be form
ed along the highway They may
later devolop into an important factor
for beautifyiug the highway

Though Dr Lear lived here but

for his genial mil kindly disposition
He was very much an optimist big
hearted and charitable lie made
friends easily and kept them Honest
inall business relations unassuming
an excellent neighbor and friend His
I passing brings real sorrow to all who
knew him
I While Dr Icar remained active his
heart bus been causing him trouble the
I past two years and though ills death
was probably painless It is n matter of
keenest regret to the family that none
of them were with him when he died
Fielding F Lear was born March 1
1856 in Marion County Mo
He was married to Susan A McGrew
September 18 1871 in Ralls County
Mo To this union were born six chil
dren two of whom died in infancy

City and Louis Lear who resides at the
family home here
Dr Lear came to Jasper seven yejirs
ago last Marqh ile bought a home
on East Grand avenue and built up a
considerable practice in the surround
ing country where his genial traits
made him a welcome visitor
The funeral was held at the family
home yesterday morning at 10 oclock
Dr Martin pastor of the M K Church
preached the sermon Interment was
made at the Brethren Cemetery A
number of friends from Lamar Shel
don Webb City and other points at
tended the funeral
Dr J J Martin delivered his lecture
on Prison Life at the M E Church last
Friday night The audience was not
large but the lecture was a pleasing
one and instructive Dr Martins four
years service as chaplain of the Missouri
Penitentiary gave him an insight at
close range into the conduct ot the In
stitution and the character of its in
mates
Secretary Bert Webb and WC
Thomas and H O Cordz of the Com
mercial Club attended a meeting of
the Lamar Commercial Club Monday
night The Jasper men were invited
