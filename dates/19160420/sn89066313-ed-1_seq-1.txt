:
MRS. M'CANN'S SUIT
GOES TOJHE JURY
Mother-in-Luw Seeks $725
From Estate of Dr. John
G. French.
SAYS SHE WAS NURSE
Case Marked by Spirited Ar
gument Brought From
Probate Court.
At C:2u this afternoon a jury in Cir
cuit Court was still considering the
case of .Mrs. E. McCann against the
estate of the late l)r. John (5. French.
Mrs. McCann. Or. French's mother-in-law,
asks $72.1 in payment for serv
ices that she says she rendered as a
trained nurse. The case was tried in
the Probate Court, the decision being
for the defendant.
Doctor French was a former resi
dent of Columbia. He moved to St.
Louis ia l'.'OO, and there became ill.
According to the testimony of Mrs.
French, ho several times engaged Mrs.
McCann to take care of him. Mrs.
McCann said that she was to receive
23 a week, the usual salary of a
graduate trained nurse, but that she
has never received a cent.
According to the testimony for the
plaintiff, she and Doctor French were
on friendly terms prior to 1914, but
in the fall of that year he became es
tranged from his wife and mother-in-law.
Doctor French died in the spring of
191.1. In his will he left half of his
estate, valued at about $3,000, to his
wife. Mrs. McCann was not mention
ed in the will. She claims that she
served as nurse to Doctor French for
thirty-two weeks, off and on.
The defense introduced testimony
to show that Doctor French was not
on friendly terms with Mrs. McCann
prior to 1914 and that during the time
she is alleged to have served him as a
trained nurse lie was well enough to
attend to his business and had no
need for a trained nurse.
The trial was marked by one "ob
jection" after another. Scarcely a
question was asked by one attorney
that the other did not object. Judge
Harris was forced repeatedly to call
them to order, so hot did the argu
ment become. Several witnesses, in
cluding Mrs. French, were objected to
on the ground that they were pre
judiced, but in each case .ludge Har
ris overruled the objection.
Russell Holloway appeared for
Mrs. McCann and X. T. Gentry for the
French estate.

young man has a chance to talk over

can be afforded."

TALKS BYMINISTERS
"Too Many Men Incline to
Mail Order Religion,'
Says C. C. Grimes.
BOTH MUST SERVE
Church Called the Stabilizer
on Machine of Commer
cial Credit.
The ministers and the business men
of Columbia met at the Commercial
Club luncheon at the Gem Cafe An
nex this afternoon and the ministers
addressed the club in five-minute
talks on the relations of religion and
business. The spirit of the occasion
disproved the old saying, as far as Co
lombia is concerned, that "Religion
and Rusiness Will Not Mix."
The Rev. T. W. Young or the Ilap
tist Church said: "It is the business
of the Commercial Club to build up
the legitimate business of the town,
and the church makes the men who
run the business. A good Christian is
always a good citizen. I want all Bap
tists to come to church."
Church as a Stabilizer.
The Rev. C. C. Grimes of the Iiroad
ivay Methodist Church said: "The
preacher is popularly not supposed to
be a business man. but I feel that he
needs no apology for appearing in a
business gathering. The church is the
stabilizer on the machine of com
mercial credit it makes more bad
bills good and keeps more good bills
from becoming bad than any other
agency. If the church is a great fac
tor in improving the credit of a com
munity, the business men, whether
member! or not, owe the church a
debt.
".Men inclined to the 'mail order'
vatiety of religion. If Hilly Sunday,
who represents the 'Sears-Roebuck
religion,' would preach here, there is
no, a business man who would not
be there to hear him and contribute
to the financial success of the meet
ing, lint we ministers, who repre
sent the religion of Columbia, never
see many of you very often. It is a
good tiling to get a business view of
religion. I have just as much right
to get my goods from Scars-Roebuck
as you have to get your religion from
other places."
The Rev. W. IV. Elwang of the Pres
byterian Church said: "The old idea
that business and religion will not
mix lias been dispelled. Of late there
has been much talk of 'frenzied fi
nance' and 'predatory wealth" but we
have come to realize that honesty is
the best policy. In order to make a
success, business men must learn how
best to serve. They must give serv
ice in the best, quickest, cleanest and
most economical way. The church is
serving the community and the
business men. The church and the
Commercial Club are at work upon the
same line one upon one end of the
line and one upon the other."
Must lVork Together.
The Rev. Madison A. Hart of the
Christian Church said: "If one does
not live his life in terms of unit:., lie
will nol live it right. Fortunatus had
an inexhaustible purse; so has the
Commercial Club. And what he could
not get with the purse, he could with
his wishing cap. Fortunatus was not
a success. lie did not use his purse
effectively and efficiently, and he was
not worthy of his wishing cap.
"It is not a question of wealth and
power, but it is a question of how
we use this wealtii and power. The
Commercial Club with its inexhausti
ble purse and the church with its
wishing cap must work together."
The Rev. W. I Halberstadt, junior
minister of the Iiroadway Methodist
Church, said: "There are a thousand
Methodist boys and girls on the Uni
versity campus. This is more than
are enrolled in all the denominational
Methodist schools in the state. The
ratio is constantly increasing. The
time is coming when Columbia will
not only be the educational center of
the state but the religious center as
well. The Commercial Club at Ur
bana helped raise $21,000 for a start
on a $."00,000 building fund. Colum
bia will come to this at a time not
far distant. Will the Commercial
Club be ready?"
Tells of orth Side Church.
The Rev. A. 15. Coffman, of the
Wilkes ISotilerard Methodist Church,
said: "The church is never over
lookedit always comes in for its
share. Hut probably you business men
have never stopped to think that if
everyone in Columbia were to go to
church, they would have to go in
shifts. The capacity of the churches
is about 5,000 and the population is
about 15,000.
"Whatever the opinion of the Com
mercial Club, the fact remains that
the people in the First Ward were
ostracized in a church way. Instead
of making people come to church, put
a churcli where it can be theirs for
a religious and social center. Every
part .r a community is a necessary
part of the community, ir I cut ofT
my right arm it will harm the rest
of my body.
"Our plan is succeeding. The at
tendance is limited only by the size
of the building. The attendance is
not taken from other congregations,
either. Out or 200 at Sunday school,
only ir, were regular attendants at
any church a year ago."
CADETS GO O.N EASTER OUTING

HOME CREWS VISITS COLCMHIA
Cornier Student Describes War's Ef
fect on Xevv York Artists.
Monte Crews, a former student in
the University, who is now a maga
zine illustrator of New York City,
was in Columbia today. Mr. Crews
is visiting relatives at Fayette.
"The war has been hard upon the
artists in New York," said .Mr. Crews.
"As soon as war was declared, the
magazines could not borrow money
to operate upon and the lield open
for illustrators was restricted In the
last year, however, artists have been
more successful in getting their work
placed. The breaking of diplomatic
relations between the United Stales
and Germany, if such a thing hap
pens, will cause a flurry that will
tighten finances again."
Mr. Crews' most popular work is
that of the illustrations for the novel
3f Homer Croy, "When to l.ock the
Stable."
TO HEAR tI,ID"CASE TOMORROW
Judge Harris Will Consider Petition
for Permanent Injunction.

fore Judge David H. Harris tomor

granted last Tuesday.
City Attorney George S. Starrett
said today that ir the permanent in
junction is granted, the "lid" will be
on tight in Columbia and that there
will be no way by which liquor can
be shipped here. According to Mr.
Starrett, it would be a violation or the
injunction to have liquor shipped in
rrom another state or to try to get It
by signing an affidavit that it was for
personal use.
