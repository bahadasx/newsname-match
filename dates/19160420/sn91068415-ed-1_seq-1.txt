Regard to Small
We think the st.att of North Caro
lina made a grave mistake when
it let down the bars in regard to
small pox by removing the quaran
tine but since this has been done
the next best thing is to prevent as
far as possible the spread of this
loathsome disease. Just because
theJe is no quarantine is no reason
why people directly exposed to the
disease should walk the streets.
mingle with the people and other- !
wise give the disease a fine chance
to spread. In the first place duty
to our fellowmen should prompt a
proper precaution whethe: it is- com
pulsory or not. There are cases
right here in town where people have
been in contact .with such patients
and they keep" right on at their work
endangering the health and lives of
others. I his is not showing the
proper respect to society though the
law does not compel.
It is however against the law to
"keep cases of smallpox on the quiet'
like has been done in a way. It is
due the people to protect them from
contagious diseases.
What are we Going to Do?
Are we to have our milk supply
and our restaurants inspected, to
safeguard the health of our people,
or shall we continue to drink and
eat without the ordinary knowledge
due human beings? Shall we drink
and eat a toast to disease, and death
or health and prosperity?.
It s up to ihe city officials to in
augurate this safeguard to health
and they are falling far shert of their
duty without if they fail to act and
net promptly. The summer months
;-re coming on and it is more im
perative than ever that this be done.

Veterans First
Birmingham, April 10."Veterans
first This is the slogan that has
been adopted by every man, woman
and child in Birmingham preparing
for the Confederate reunion May 15,
17 and 18. It has been determined
by the various committees in charge
of the reunion to contribute to the
comfort, ease and enjoyment of the
Confederate veterans and no con
sideration will be permitted to stand
in the light of that high resolve. The
people of Birmingham that ate to
welcome the veterans perhaps for
the last time have planned every
detail of the three days for the
heroes of 1860-65. While there will
be gay affairs and entertainments
of many kinds for the visitors, yet
the ambition has been deterrhined
upon to center upon the men who
bared their breasts to the cannons
merciless fire during the Civil War.
