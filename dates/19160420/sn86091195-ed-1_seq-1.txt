ïavey's Beautiful Cross.
The beautiful electric cross typical
of Raster, when the crucified Christ as
cended to heaven, is attracting much at
tention and admiration in the window
of the Brown-Hart store. It is also au
impressive emblem of Manager Tavey's
artistic decorative ability that cannot
help but redound to his reputation as a
progressive, Christian merchant.

Public D rinkin g Punished.
During the present lull in the county
jail it is being treated to a fresh coat
of whitewash for the benefit of its
three occupants. Last Tuesday morn
ing R. A. Walker, who hails from Ver
non, Utah, and who says he was vis
iting friends, is now an occupant of the
city bastile and is employed on the
streets. The crime for which his visit
was unexpectedly postponed was the
taking of a " smile ' ' from a flask of
whiskey in public on the depot plat
form in the august presence of Chief
of Police Sewell, who immediately ush
ered him into the presence of Police
Judge Good, who fined him $ 120 . 1 ) 0 , or
ten days, and he choose the latter fate
rather than send for money to his chil
dren, whom he is loath to inform of his
predicament. The remnants of his flask
were confiscated, and had it not been
for his 64 years he would have hail to
answer to a charge of over-indulgen.-»
in the forbidden liquid.
Federal Hearing.
Jesse Adams, the colored boy charged
with selling whiskey to Henry Kisher,
an Indian who was run over and killed
by a train in this city while in an in
toxicated condition, was given a pre
liminary hearing this afternoon in the
office of United States Commissioner
Turner. Adams was bound over to the
federal court and his bond fixed at $500,
and in lieu of which he was confined
in the county jail. Horton H. Miller,
the government Indian agent at Port
Hall, was present at the hearing and it
is stated that several charges will be
made against Adams.
Ralph Dixie, who attended the trial
of the colored boot-legger who sold
Henry Kisher the whiskey which is sup
posed to have caused his death, says
that there are suspicions that the death
of Kisher was not altogether accidental.
The fact that none of the $50 he had
when he left Blaekfoot was found on
his person, and also the many wounds
on his person are said not to have been
caused by the car wheels passing over
him, as there were no broken bones,
ami the wounds have every appearance
of knife cuts inflicted by some robber
assailant.

Palm Sunday Auto Accidents
Are Numerous.
Last Sunday—Palm Sunday—seems
to have been a very unlucky Sabbath
for automobile owners, as about eight
of their machines were badly demol
ished and their occupants seriously "Mid
painfully injured, some of whom had
a narrow escape with their lives.
The town of Kirth was the scene of
most of the misfortune that was caused
by the alleged carelessness of "Dad"
Llay, one of the oldest and most exper
ienced auto drivers in this vicinity. Ac
cording to the story of the accident,
Ben Sage, of Shelley, was going north
in a Kord with his family, followed by
Mr. Clay in a Hupmobile, with 'Mr.
Dawe, a friend. Evidently Mr. Sage
was not traveling fast enough for the
veteran autoist, who attempted to pass
him by turning to the left, with in
creased speed. Just us he made the
turn he encountered a Studebaker car
which was coming south, with Kred
Nelson, his wife and two brothers, all
of whom were slightly cut and bruised
His wife was the one mostly injured,
.she having had her front teeth knocked
out. The force of the collision of the
IIup with the Stmlebaker threw the
I Ilup over on the Ford, when Mr. Sage's
I little daughter was thrown violently
; against the wind-shield and badly lac
i crated. The other occupants of the
Ford were not seriously injured. Mr.
Clay, who is quite an aged man, escaped
with a sprained wrist and several slight
bruises. The three care were piled up
in a mass of wreckage that resembled
An Honest Man.

j endless search for an honest man, but
; that was many years ago, and if he had
been fortunate enough to live in the '

without half trying, as Mother Just can
testify.
Last Friday this Mother Just, who
lives up the Blaekfoot river, lost her
precious Hetty Green hand-bag—it
hasn t as much in it as Hetty Green 's,
but she felt the loss just as keenly.
She knew it had been picked up some
where on the road southwest of Black
foot that leads to the Stevens ranch,

a scrap pile. Kred Nelson contends that
he could not have averted the accident
as he was on the right of the road and
could not have given Mr. Clay more
room even if he had had the time to
u ' 'l° n c so. Mr. Clay acknowledges
that he was the cause of the wrecking
of* the Ford, and has signified his will
ingness to have it repaired.
In the evening at the scene of this
auto disaster another serious accident
was miraculously averted. Mrs. C. W.
Berryman, Jr, who was returning home
from Meise Springs in her car, stopped
to view the remains of the three de
funct cars, and was about alighting
when Dr. Simmons with his ear ap
peared upon the scene and accidentally
collided with the Indy's car, the jolt
ot which threw the fair autoist violent
ly to the ground and injuring her hip,
though not seriously.
Dad Clay and his attorney, Arthur
Holden, arrived in Blnckfoot yester
day morning to entertain a warrant
served on the former for reckless and
imprudent driving, that tended to in
jure persons and property. Attorney
Holden contends that the accident was
not due to carelessness or imprudence
on the part of his client, and will enter
a plea of not guilty when Probate Judge
Doud returns from-Twin Kails.

Anyone who knows Mother Just and
he r hand bag knows that she would
rather part with all her other earthly
possessions than with that one myster
ious, tan-colored carry-all with the
brass chain handle. So her friends be
gan to fear that some inhuman creature
had "Charlie Rossed" the small bag.
Theji a timid voice over the telephone
said! ''Is thi* Mrs. Emma Just's
hoinef Well, tell her I found her hand
bag along the road today, and if she
will call 42S> I shall return it to her."
And when she called 429 that boy was
as glad to restore the lost hand-bag as
the worrying woman was to receive it.
I wonder if obi Diogenes could be
made to believe that there were five
perfectly good dollars in the bag, and
several more just behind it. all of which
the young man stoutly refused to ac
cept.

While in Blaekfoot last Friday Mrs.
N. A. Just lost her bug containing a
purse and some highly treasured trink
