FIELD' HEADQUARTEHS. Mexico,
April 17, (Via Aereo to Columbus,
N. M., April 20.) Continued lack
of effective military cooperation by
Carranza authorities has been met by
the American expeditionary columns.
At some places the Americans have re
ceived considerable courtesy from local
earranxa officials, but at others there
has been a little sniping on Americans.
PrnmiHu nf CkrraniA cooneration
have not materialized, due to the lack
i of organized 'government in the re
gions penetrated and to coiuness or
Carranza commanders or from some
local leadr. For a long time Ameri
can officers did not feel certain which
attitude, friendliness or opposition,' the
Mexicans would assume- and therefore
unfriendly Incidents were minimfted
throHgb the censorship. Today Mttle
hope remained that Jurthw progress
could be made without serious clashes

meats among outlying Oarranza com
mands, American Officers.
The caution of American officers
against any act which might excito
enmity has been one of the great liand
lcapa, although self imposed. They
have not fired on Vlilistas at times,
because not sure of their identity. At
Parral Maj. Frank Tompkins, who had
only 114 men. permitted only his rifle
experts and marksmen to' return the
Carranza fire In order to avoid danger
of hitting women or children, and the
effectiveness of American resistance
was thereby reduced.
