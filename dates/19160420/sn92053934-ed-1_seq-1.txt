Situation to Envoy of
Secretary Baker.
General Pershinn's camp at the
front, April 15, (via aeroplane to
( nlmiihus, N. M., April 20. Ameri
can aeroplanes have been fired
upon several times by Mexicans
and in at least one case the as
sailants were Carrauzu soldiers.
The latter instance was report
cd by Lieutenants ('. K. Chapman,
who dew into eamp tliis morning
after an absence of three days on
what should have been, under
normal conditions a two hours'
flight.
An American army officer was fired
upon this evening while passing a
email town near this camp in com
pany with a dispatch bearer.
The shooting was without effect.
Cavalry troops today located the camp
of Candeiario Cervantes, a Villa lieu
tenant, in the mountains some miles
from here. Apparently Cervantes' out
posts were able to give him word of
the American approach, but his es
cape was narrow. Seven horses were
taken. Three Mexicans found in that
vicinity were brought to headquarters
...to be questioned. ,
San Antonio, April 20. Early with
drawal of the troops sent into Mexico
as a punitive expedition or the au
thorization of military operations on a
big scale, must be the result of Gen
eral Hugh L. Scott's Investigation of
the situation, in the opinion of army
officers here. General Funston and
his staff are ready to show the chief
of staff all the written records of the
failure to catch Villa and are prepared
to place him in touch with the unwrit
ten evidence.
Say Villa fan Be Taught.
Villa, if he is alive, can be caught,
officers here believe, but only by the
adoption of a plan that Mexicans gen
erally almost certainly would charac
terize as a war. Hostility of Mexicans
has become so marked that these of
ficers are convinced further operations
must be undertaken with the under
standing that armed opposition by both
factions will be met.
Troop movements ordered by Gen
eral Funston were being carried out
today. General Pershing is holding
intact bis 10,000 men, stretched from
Columbus to points almost four hun
dred miles from the border.
General Pershing has sent through
several reports in the past 48 hours
but General Funston has made none
of them public.
El Paso, Texas, April 20. While the
American punitive expedition is mark
ing time today in its pursuit of Fran
cisco Villa, efforts are being made to
strengthen the army bases and lines of
communic ation. Fears are openly ex
pressed by army officers that should
an order come to withdraw the Amer
ican troops, the Villa and other ma
rauding bands will raise the cry that
the American troops are In retreat,
with the result that the American
army will ho subject to constant night
attacks and sniping as they retire
from Mexico.
Prepares for Emergencies.
To prevent such warfare against his
columns, General Pershing is prepar
ing to be in a position to move his
fores in large units. The belief is
general at Fort Bliss that the United
States troops will encounter more dif
ficulties in a withdrawal from Mexico
than they did on their rapid 400-mile
drive from Columbus to Parral.
No word lias come from General Ca
vazos, who, with Colonel Carranza,
as reported to have gone to Kan
Francisco Borja to bring back the
body of Villa.
A dispatch from Chihuahua says to
day that the Parral district Is quiet
and that Villa is not dead, but has
passed far south Into Durango, many
wiles from the nearest American col
umn now resting at a point near Par
ral. RelJete Villa Dead.
The growing belief that Francisco
Villa is dead, whether or not his body
bas been recovered, was strengthened
ai KI Paso today by messages re
ceived by American mining concerns
here from their agents at Cusihuir
iachic, Parral, Santa Barbara and
Guerrero.
All of these messages agreed that

EMPEROR "HTLHEUr OF GERMANY
PLOT UNEARTHED
IN SHIP SEIZURES
ABrWsJ, -Government Claims to HaTe
Bared German Exploit From Those
Aboard Liner China.
London, April 19. As the result of
the seizure of German and Austrian
subjects aboard the China mail liner
China last February while bound from
Shanghai for the United States, the in
telligence department of the govern
ment is said to have uncovered a plot
of immense ramifications conducted
with the purpose of causing a revolu
tion in India.
The American headquarters of the
plotters is said to be on the Pacific
coast. At least one ship is known to
have sailed from San Francisco with
a German crew and Indian conspir
ators and arms on board.
The headquarters of the plot in the
Orient was at Shanghai and when
the gun-running and other machina
tions were uncovered, according to
the authorities here, the plotters set
sail for Manila aboard the steamship
China.
The leaders of the plot seized on the
China are said to have had in their
possession false passports which they
destroyed. Among the men taken
from the vessel were five Austrian
officers as well as a number of Ger
mans from the German ships interned
in Shanghai and at other Chinese
ports.
The British officials say they be
lieve than Franz Bopp, the German
consul general at San Francisco and
other persons under federal indict
ment there participated in the plot.
The seizure of the party on the China
did not end the plot, according to offic
ials here, who declare that all its
ramifications have not yet been traced.
They state that enough is known,
however, to check any possibility of
trouble in India.

American Note.
EXPECT EARLY REPLY

lowed by Wilson Gerard
Gets the Message.
Berlin, April 20, (via Lon
don 1 :46 p. m.) The Amer
ican note to Germany ar
rived in Berlin late yesterday
evening. Ambassador Ger
ard probably will present it
to the foreign office early
this afternoon.
Washington, April 20. Count
von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, went to the state de
partment today for a conference
with Secretary Lansing on the
submarine warfare situation and
also to discuss the arrest in New
York of Wolfe Ton Igel, secretary
of former German military at
tache, Captain von Papen.
Secretary Lansing and the Ger
man ambassador were in confer
ence fully 20 minutes. After the
ambassador had left the secretary
of state would make no statement
regarding the discussion which
took place.
' After the conference it was learned
that German diplomats regard the
receipt of a reply from Germany
within two or three days as physically
impossible. It was thought a reply
could not be received here before ten
days. It was pointed out that Easter
Monday is a holiday in Germany and
that necessary consultations of offic
ials would cause almost another week
to elapse before the German decision
could be transmitted here.
German Ambassador Bernstorff re
fused to discuss his conversation with
Secretary Lansing but indicated his
call was not prompted by the arrival
of instructions from his government.
Regarding the hope held by German
officials here for an amicable settle
ment, one official described the pros
pect as a "toss up."
Explained to Bernstorff.
Secretary Lansing explained in de
tail to the German ambassador the
position of the United States and is un
derstood to have expressed the sincere
hope that the attitude of German gov
ernment would be so adjusted as to
meet the position taken by the United
States.
The ambassador was understood to
have informed the secretary of the
details of a message he sent yesterday
to his government making certain
recommendations which he believed,
if acceptable to his government, would
be satisfactory to the United States.
In addition the ambassador In
formed the secretary of a message of
a highly confidential nature he had
received from Berlin.
Last night Count von Bernstorff ap
peared hopeful that some way would
be found to prevent a break of rela
tions. His manner today indicated
that he was not so sanguine.
Trepares Message to Berlin.
After returning to the embassy.
Count von Bernstorff prepared a long
dispatch which probably will be tent
to his government before night. The
ambassador was authoritatively rep
resented as having sought the secre
tary's views in regard to a tentative
proposal that Germany issue Immed
iately a declaration covering all sub
marine operations similar to that is
sued on Jan. 7 for the operations in
the Mediterranean. How the sugges
tion was received was not divulged but
the general belief is that no step will
be considered until some direct re
sponse from Berlin has been re
ceived by the secretary of state.

EXPLORER FINDS A
NEW INDIAN TRIBE
Philadelphia, April 20. Nine sur
vivors of a once populous tribe of In
dians hitherto unknown to white men
have been found by Dr. William C. Far
abee, leader of the University Muse
um's Amazon expedition. A letter
from Dr. Farabee, dated March 16, tell
ing of this and other discoveries, was
made public today by the museum of
ficials. An epidemic of grip, Dr. Farabee be
lieves, was responsible for the tribe's
destruction. The Indians were the
Piklpltanges, a name heretofore un
known to ethnology. No one could be
found to speak their language, but Dr.
Farabee succeeded in making a vocab
ulary of 170 words, which he will study
in the hope of finding out what gen
eral branch of the Indians this rem
nant belongs.
The survivors are a chief, six women
and two boys. They were in utter des
titution when the museum's explorers
found them.
Another discovery of the expedition
was the remnants of an uncatalogued
tribe of Indians on the Amazon. In
the upper reaches of the Maraca river,
Dr. Farabee reported, there once lived
a tribe with the peculiar characteristic
of burying their dead in urns of pot
tery, made to receive the body in a
sitting posture. Poor people, he re
ports, had plain urns, but the richer
were buried "in urns fashioned to re
semble a man with an effort at por
traiture of the face, something after
the manner of the Egyptians."
WATSON, QUICK! HERE
IS A REAL MYSTERY
Chicago, April 20. Yuen Poon was
one of two Chinese ordered deported
j-esterday for being in this country il
legally. Poon's trouble lay in the fact
that he was rather undecided as to
where he was born.
When questioned he said he was
born in San Francisco but that his
mother and father were both in China
and had never been in this country at
any time.
Three other Chinese forfeited bonds
of $1,500 each for non-appearance at
the trial as to their right to remain
here.

Strong Force of Russian
Troops Landed to Fight
for France.
Paris, April 20, (12:10 p. m.)
A strong force of Russian troops
disembarked at Marseilles at noon
today. The Russians are to fight
beside the allied soldiers in France.
General Joffre welcomed the
Russians In an order of the day,
saying their arrival was another
proof of the devotion of Russia to
the common cause.
French troops took the offensive last
night in the Verdun region on the right
bank of the Meuse. The war office an
nouncement of this afternoon says that
they captured parts of German
trenches, occupied a redoubt and took
several hundred prisoners.
French War Report.
The statement follows:
"In the Argonne at Haute Chevau-.
chee there has been some mine work
which resulted to our advantage.
"On the left bank of the Meuse the
bombardment of our second line con-!
tinued last night On the right bank
our troops yesterday evening delivered '
a spirited attack against the German 1
positions northwest of the pond of'
Vaux. This operation made it possl-'
ble for us to occupy certain sections
of the German trenches, as well as a '
fortified redoubt. In the course of this
action, which caused heavy losses to
the enemy, we took prisoner 10 offi
cers, 16 under-offtcers and 214 men. In
addition to this we captured several
machine guns and a certain quantity of
war material."
The text of the order issued by Gen
eral Joffre follows:
Our faithful ally, Russia, whose
armies already are fighting so valor-
ously against Germany, Austria and;
Turkey, wanted to give France further !
assurance of her friendship; more
striking proof of her devotion to the
common cause.
"Russian soldiers chosen from the
bravest in her armies and commanded
by officers of the highest renown, have
come to fight in our ranks.
"You will receive them like brothers.
You will show them that warm sym
pathy which you feel toward those
who leave their country to come and
fight at our sides.
"In the name of the French I wel
come the officers, under-offlcers and
soldiers of Russia who have debarked
in France. I bow before the Russian
flags upon which there soon will be
inscribed the glorious names of our
victories."
Germans Hard Pressed.
French resistance in the region of
Verdun is compelling the German gen
eral staff to withdraw large forces
from the Teuton front in Macedonia
and Serbia and in Russia, according
to information obtained today from the
highest military authorities here.
The first division of the first Ger
man army corps and another division
not yet identified, are said to be among
the troops which have Just been
brought from the other fronts. The
18th army corps and the 11th Bavarian
division, it is declared, have been
brought from Serbia.

army headquarters today. The state
ment says:
"Western front: In the Ypres salient

points in penetrating the EngUsh
trenches. In one Instance on the high
road between Langemarck and Ypres

enemy's positions, taking 109 prison
ers and two machine guns.
"East of Tracy Le Mont a quantity of
gas directed by the enemy last night
against our trenches only spread Into
the trenches of the French themselves.
"In the Meuse sector the enemy di
rected, a lively artillery fire against the
positions which we had captured from
him on the eastern bank of the river.
"In the Caillette wood a preparatory
artillery lire of the enemy developed
toward evening into a stroug attack
which was repulsed."
