FINAL DAY FINDS 14
CANDIDATES IN RACE
Twelve Republicans and Two Demo
crats in Morrow County Have Filed
For Primary Election. Three
Come Out Tils Week.
The final day for filing for the pri
mary election found 14 candidates

this week were G. A.,Bleakman of
Hardman and E. L. Padberg, of lone,
both republicans for commissioner
and Jeff Jones, democrat of Heppner
for sheriff. The past tew weeks has
also seen a big increase in registra
tion and by the time all precincts
have been heard from it is likely the
total number of registered voters will
be In the neighborhood of 1500. The
present estimate is that 1200 of these
will be republicans, the greater part
of the remainder democrats, with on
ly one progressive in the entire coun
ty registered.
Twelve of the 14 avowed candi
dates are republicans and it is in the
ranks of the G. O. P. that any contest
will be waged between candidate for
the same office. For county clerk, J.
A. Waters, present Incumbent, and
Fred Tash, both of Heppner, are
seeking the nomination. ' However,
the county treasurer's office is the
scene of the greatest rivalry, there
being three strong men on the repub
lican tickt after this position. Their
announcements were forthcoming si
multaneously. They are Oscar Borg,
J. L. Wilklns and T. J. Humphreys.
On the democratic ticket, Hanson
Hughes is assured of the nomination
since he has no opposition. For coun
ty commissioner, E. L. Padberg of
, lone, present Incumbent, will have
opposition for the nomination in
George Bleakman, of Hardman. -Mrs.
C. W. Shurte of Heppner and Herbert
W. Copeland of Iteith, Ore., are both
after the superintendence of schools.
B. E. Notson for district attorney and
M. L. Case for coroner, as well as

meet with no opposition for these re
Bpective offices at the primary elec
tion. ,

and wife and two sons, and Mr. and
Mrs. W. E. Pruyn were out motoring
last Sunday afternoon. At the time
of the accident Mr. Thomson was
driving down Hinton creek, traveling
at thirty miles an hour. The acci
dent was caused by the spindle break
insr in one of the wheels.

ENDGR5ESMRS.5HURTE
As the time for the primary elec
tion approaches I would like to rec
ommend to the citizens of the county
Mrs. C. W. Shurte for County School
Superintendent. In doing this I have
no selfish or personal motives. I do
it in the Interest of better schools.
Mrs. Shurte has taught In the Hepp
ner schools the last two years and I
have had an opportunity to judge of
her work as perhaps no other person
in the county has had. I have seldom
met a better teacher. She is an ex
cellont Instructor, is thoroughly mod
ern in all her methods, an enthusiast
in Industrial work just what our
rural schools need and last but not
least, Tsho, has exceptional power in
organizing teachers and inspiring
them in their work. When it is re
called that the majority of the rural
teachers of this county are usually
inexperienced young women or girls
just graduated from high school, it
will he seen how Invaluable to them
will be the counsel and judgment of
a woman of Mrs. Shurte's tempera
ment and experience.
I feel that I am doing only a pub
lic service In recommending to the
voteTs of Morrow County, Mrs. C. W.
Shurte for County School Superin
tendent. Respectfully yours,
H. H. HOFFMAN,
Supt. of City Schools.

MAN DISAPPEARS IN DECEM-BER.-NOT
BEEN HEARD OF
SINCE.-MAY HAVE PERISHED
Rube Gaunt left Parkers Mill on
the 15th of last December bound for
the Allen place between Ditch and
Wall creeks. No trace of the man
has been found since his leaving the
mill.
Searching parties headed by Mr.
Gaunt's son Bernle have failed to re
veal his whereabouts, and since he
started over the mountains during
one of the most severe storms of the
winter, it is feared that he may have
become lost and perished itf some ob
scure place. Mr. Gaunt is an elderly
man and has spent many years In
the' mountains where it is feared he
has been lost. In the past he kept

That many of the farmers of Mor
row county have wheat on the brain,
is the belief of Farmer Smith, agri
culturist for the Oregon-Washington
Railroad & Navigation Company.
Farmer Smith has been devoting sev
eral days of his time to some of the
lighter farm lands in the northern
part of the county and he is confi
dent that if cultivated properly, corn
may be raised on those lands in suf
ficient quantity and quality to make
it a better paying porposition than
raising wheat.
The farmer here shows poor judg
ment In Mr. Smith's opinion when he
does not have sufficient feed to pull
his stock through the winter in good
condition. According to Mr. Smith,
there is no better feed ot be had than
corn, and he is striving to teach our
farmers the value of growing this
cereal. Many of the farmers north of
the Base Line have been supplied
with seed corn and they will try this
new crop this year.
A little more diversification is in
order. The veteran agriculturist be
lieves that this section has gone too
much toward wheat and that better
results are bound to follow with the
diversified system.
Farmer Smith at the present time
is conducting some practical experi
ment work at the W. D. Newlon
farm. Most of the corn will be sowed
on land under irrigation.
I IS MB
E. M. Shutt this week disposed ot
26 head, a car load, of his Holsteln
milk stock, to J. H. McGinley, of
Council, Idaho. Mr. McGinley has
arranged to ship the stock on Friday.
He is an experienced man in the cat
tle busines, having engaged in this
quite extensively in Western Nebras
ka in years past. The bunch he has
purchased from Mr. Shutt will be
added to what he purchased of the
same breed a few weeks ago in the
Yakima country, and Mr. McGinley
expects to enter into the dairy bus
iness on an extensive scale. This
will bring some relief to Mr. Shutt
who has been very closely confined to
the home ranch since getting so much
dairy stock on hand, and he will now
be able to move out once In a while
and take some recreation. The Shutt
ranch receives much praise at the
hands of Mr. McGinley, who finds ev
erything about the place kept up in
the very best style and all stables and
barns in a very clean and sanitary
condition.
There has been some Blight freez
ing in this locality during the past
week, and the weather has been
pretty "raw." All reports, however,
are to the effect that so far no In
jury has been done the prospective
fruit crop. If nothing happens, the
lone country will turn out, a very
abundant crop of fruit this season.
Trees are now fairly burdened with
blossoms and many of the earlier va
rieties are now showing fruit ot the
size of marbles. The prospects for
apricots, plums and peaches are very
flattering.
Mrs. J. M. Morris and children de
parted this week for Spokane, Wn.,
where it is supposed she will join her
husband. It will be remembered that
Morris left here rather suddenly last
fall, not leaving his future address,
but on the other hand leaving numer
ous unpaid bills and accounts, and de
serting his wife and family of small
children. Here is hoping that he may
fully repent ot the error of his ways,
and remember those here who stood
by him in his time ot need.
SAYS
up correspondence with his sister,
Mrs. C. H. Morris of North Yakima,
Wash. She became alarmed after
failing to receive any replies to her
letters. Mrs. Morris came to Hepp
ner recently to find some trace of her
brother but returned home after
hearing the reports of the searching
parties. ',
Hope is still held out that Mr.
Gaunt changed his mind after leav
ing Parkers Mill, going somewhere
else and that he will notify his rela
tives soon. A substantial reward is
being offered for any information
that will lead to the recovery of the
missing man. Information should be
addressed to John Gaunt, Heppner.
. The county courts of Umatilla and
Morrow counties met on the boun
dary line of the two counties on Wed
nesday afternoon and discussed at
length the proposed change in the
Hog Hollow road. They were ac
companied on their trip by many
other citizens of the two counties
and about fifty people were present
at the meeting.
The plan as discussed, is to change
the road out of Hog Hollow just
above Vinson and proceed up another
canyon which will afford a much bet
ter grade. The new road will go al
most entirely through the lands be
longing to Pat Doherty. It is esti
mated ' that the proposed change
would cost Morrow county about
$1300, most of this expense being for
cost Incurred for fencing and right-itfr-iissy
.Very little of the new road
is in Umatilla county.
Speeches were made by many of
those present, chief among which
were the members of the two courts,
Dillard French, F. W. Vincent and
T. J. Mahoney. Those who were pres
ent from Heppner were C. C. Patter
son, county judge, George J. Currin
and E. L. Padberg, county commiss
ioners, T. J. Mahoney, M. D. Clark, J.
L. Wilklns, Ed Kellogg and J. S.
Whitbeck. It was voted unanimous
ly at the meeting to begin work on
the new road in twenty days. George
Currin will return In a few days to
look over the land, and get djtta as to
costs for the right of way.

Benefit Entertainment Big Success.
On last Friday evening Heppner
High School added another laurel to
the wreath they already possessed,
when they brought to a successful
close their annual benefit entertain
ment for the athletic association.
After several weeks of preparation
the students came before the large
audience sure that their efforts would
be successful, and they were not dis
appointed. The first number, "Sum
mer," from Wagner, by the school
chorus was an excellent song excell
ently sung, and gave the hearers a
little insight into the good things to
come. ,
The recitation, "Roger and I," giv
en by Emery Gentry showed evidence
of diligent preparation and excellent
elocutionary ability on' the part of
the performer.
A sight that will long be remem
bered by the audience was the Rose
Drill by sixteen of the prettiest girls
in the school. Each onewas dregsel
in white with rose trimmings, and
each carried in her hand a long staff
with a rose attached to the end. This
number was loudly applauded.
Much mystery surrounded the 4th
number on the program which was
listed simply as a "Surprise." After
much preparation of the stage the
curtain was pulled, dlsclosiug Irwin,
the Master Hynotist. After a few re
marks explaining the nature 'of his
entertainment, Mr. Irwin called for
volunteers from the audience to be
hypnotised. Six of the high school
huskies" responded, and with the
aid of his electrical apparatus the
hypnotist put them to sleep. While
iu this state and through the direc
tion of Mr. Irwin, the subjects per
formed many stunts and laughable
antics which greatly amused the
audience. It was indeed a neat "take
off" on the professional fake hypno
tist and in itself was worth the price
of admission to the entertainment.
The first year German class en
tertained with the German song,
'Mignon" and were called back for
an encore, in response to this can
they sang "Augustine."
The play by the quartet, composed
of Charles Barlow, Clarence Scrivner,
Lester Ingrum and Earl Gordon, was
good. The name, "Bachelors and
Benedicts," suggests Its nature. Gor
don and Scrivner, as the bachelors,
upheld their unmarried state of con
tentment against the claims of Bar
low and Ingrum, the Benedicts, that
married life was the only life. Sev
eral songs and much amusing conver
sation entered into the play and the
boys "got it across" in nice shape.
"Shadows," a pleasing Southern
play, was given in a manner which
surprised the audience, used to the
usual amateur theatricals.
" Neva Hayes, In the part of Aunt
Geranium, a negro "Mammy," could
not have been better and the auditors
were often convulsed at her delinea
tion of this difficult part. The first
part was a scene between -Aunt Ger
anium and Virginia Lee,, a Southern
maid, (Norma Frederic) and made
plain the fact that Virginia was about
to give up the man she loved for a
rich Northerner. Aunt Geranium,
in trying to dissuade her, began to
tell her the story of her (Virginia's)
greatgrandmother, who seemingly
had been in the same predicament
years before. During the progress of
the telling Virginia fell asleep and
dreamed. The dream constituted the
second part of the play. In the Inter
val between the two parts Charles
Barlow sang "The Dream."
In the dream Virginia witnessed
the love scene between her great
grandmother, Alice Fairfax, and the
young Confederate officer, just back
from the war. Ruth Howard took
the part of Alice Fairfax and Cecil
Lleuallen the part of Gordon Stan
ford, the young soldier, and they
handled them very cleverly. In the
midst ot the scene, and Just after
Alice had told Gordon that she could
cere direct

Heppner's New Industry Will Open
For Business May 1st. 200
Pounds Butter Per Day to
Start With.
The Morrow County Creamery
stockholders held their first meeting
in Heppner last Saturday afternoon.
The directors were elected and other
business pertinent to the opening up
of this new industry, was transacted.
The directors are Frank Wlnnard, W.
A. Wilcox, J. F. Vaughn, ChM. Thom
son and M. D. Clark. Ira M. Morgan,
organizer of the company, has been
retained as butter maker and general
manager.
The creamery will open for busi
ness on May 1st, according to the
plans of Mr. Morgan, who is now bus
ily engaged in laying concrete floors
for the plant and installing the
creamery machinery. Some of the
machinery has not yet arrived, but
will be here in time to be put in by
the day set for opening. Mr. Morgan
states that the plant will manufac
ture 200 pounds of butter each day
to begin with and will be gradually
increased as the business is develop
ed. He believes that the territory
here is capable of eventually support
ing one of the best creameries in the
state, and wishes to assure all pa
trons that the quality ot butter will
be as good as the best and there will
be no reason for buying butter made
at outside points.
The plant will be located in. the
Wells building on Willow street. Just
back of the new Masonic building.
The location is considered a good one
inasmuch as there is an alley at the
rear which gives ample approach to
the building.

Sarah Luella Tash was born in
Leon, Iowa, March 8, 1878; came to
Oregon when about 6 years of age
with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Hiram
Tash. She was married to Charles
Stanton March 17, 1901.
To this union were born five child
ren, four girls and one boy, the lat

Mrs. Stanton had been married
just fiften years and one month at
the time of her death. She leaves to
mourn her loss five children, her hus
band, one sister, two brothers, and
her father and mother. All of these
were present at the funeral , which
was conducted April 19, from the
home of the deceased, by Turner B.
MacDonald of the Christian church
of Heppner. The interment was in
the Hardman cemetery.
Mrs. Stanton was a member of the
Baptist church, and was regarded
very highly by those who knew her,
as was manifested by the unusual
attendance at the funeral.
The deepest sympathy is felt for

of Hale, and the suicide of Gordon
in rapid succession. Altha Devin in
the part of Mrs. Fairfax and Norton

parts naturally and successfully.
The noise of the shot when Gordon
committed suicide awoke Virginia,
and Robert Ashton, her nearly-rejected
lover, (Earl Gordon) arrived
in time to quiet her fears and at the
same time receive her promise to
marry him.
The play was very pleasingly exe
cuted and the school is to be congrat
ulated on possessing such high dra
matic talent, and able directors.

The proceeds of the entertainment
which amounted to $37, will go a
long way toward relieving the athle
