WILL1EET NEXT SATURDAY
- v DEMOCRATIC CLUBS ARE TO
ELECT THEIR DELEGATES.
i
, V Under Revised Rules County Conventions
Will Meet First Monday in
May, State Convention May 17.
All the Democratic clubs in South
V Carolina meet on the fourth Satur
sday in April, which is the 22nd inst,,
fr to reorganize, elect delegates to the
county convention and transact any
other business.
It is in the club meeting that the
individual citizen has a direct voice.
2 It is a sort of mass meeting, or "town
*" - meeting," but it is within the Democratic
party, subject to the strict
6r rules of the party organization. Here
f may be offered resolutions expressive
of the sentiment of the individual
voter, or instructions for the dele?
gates to the county convention.
Under the new rules, now enacted
N into law by the legislature, "no person
shall be enrolled in any club, or
I > take part in any club meeting, or
vote in any primary, or be elected a
delegate to the county convention,
except in the club district in which
% . / t . #
he resides.
The county convention meets on
/ the first Monday in May and is composed
of one member for each 25
L members or majority fraction thereof,
ia each 'club, according to the
Pt \ vote at the preceding first State priH
monr o1or?+-irm TTitk t? a phan^p from
B { the old rule that gave representa
tion for eacli 25 members carried on
the roll of the club?which came to
include much dead material?not
BB only the actual "dead," but the perHB
sons moved away,-whose names remained
on the club lists .because
r there was no procedure for revising
^ the rolls.
Th& new basis of representation
will considerably reduce the numbers
ha the county convention?which
had come f? be too unwqildy for effective
parliamentary deliberation.
/ 1 It will reduce the number of delesates
to be sent from the clubs, esx
pecially the city clubs, where the actual
numbers could not be personally
known to members and an unauthorized
attempt to revise the rolls might
erroneously cut off some one from his
" rightful membership. The reform of
1914 has insured equitable representation
on the basis of the really active
membership.
The State convention meets on -the
third Wednesday in May, the 17th*
this year, end is composed of two
delegates for, each member of the
general assembly trom a county. Thus
Bamberg has 6 delegates in the
4 State convention. 1
t
Some of the matters likely to come
before the clubs preparatory to action
in the convention are: Indorsement
of the administration of Woodrow
Wilson; demand for rural credit
t
legislation; indorsement of Senator
S. * E. D. Smith's amendment for the opi
eration of a nitrate plant by the Unitjr
ed States government for "preparedness"
in war and for providing cheap
fertilizers to the farmers in time of
i - S
peace, and possibly expressions on
the insurance situation.

Thirty-eight Horses Burned.
Early Friday morning the stables
of Slater Bros, were discovered en*
tirely covered with fire, and the huge
wooden building burned rapidly.
' ; Thirty-eight horses and mules were
burned as a result of the blaze, which
was so quick that they could not he
taken out in time to save them.
< From two o'clock until five the firemen
remained on the scene, but at
last entirely extinguished the fire.
During the progress of the fire
some of the best work ever pulled
* off by the fire department was ex
ercised in order to save nearby builds'
ings which took fire as a result of
* the severe heat and sparks flying in
all directions. The bottling plant of
S. H. Crum, the residences of Police
, Sergeant Frankling, A. H. Marchant
and Julian A. Salley were all set
afire at different times during the
progress of the fire. No serious dam
age was done any of these, although
I - about one-third of the bottling
| plant's roof was destroyed.
The loss was heavy upon the firm
of Slater Bros., and it is not known
\ exactly what insurance they carried.

McCOKMICK COUNTY STANDS.
Supreme Court Upholds Validity of
Its Creation. !
-Columbia, April 13.?The election
providing for the establishment of
McCormick county was declared by
an. en banc session of the supreme
court to have been legally held. There
are now 45 counties in South Carolina,
the new unit having been recognized
by an act of the last legislature.
The en banc session of the supreme
court was attended by a large num
ber of advocates of the new county.
The new unit will be made up from
Edgefield, Abbeville and Greenwood
counties.
The new county movement has
been carried after a fight extending
over a period of 20 years.
Citizens of the new county are
making arrangements for a celebration
at McCormick today. Yesterday
they extended an invitation to Governor
Manning to attend the celebration.
The governor was forcfed to decline
because of several engagements
in Columbia.
The* election was held last year.
An appeal was taken to the. State
board of canvassers and the election
was declared to have been legally
held. Then the case was carried on
to -the supreme court. After hearing
the arguments and giving the
matter much consideration, the five
justices of the supreme.court failed
to agree and the circuit judges of
the State were called to their assistance.
In 1905 an election was held and
carried by a majority of four to one
in favor of McCormick county, but
the opponents won out in the courts
because the required area was lack
ing. At another election in 1914 the
new county agitators won by a vote
of six to one, but for the second
time it was set aside by the courts.
The last in 1915 won out by a big
majority.
McCormick, the county,seat of the
new county* is located on the Charleston.
and Western Carolina railway,
43 miles above Augusta and 25 miles
from Abbeville, Greenwood and Edgefield.
Georgia Girl First in Eugenics.
./
/
( \
Atlanta, Ga., April 13.?A Georgia
girl is the first person to enroll in the
eugenics registry, which. has just
been instituted by the National Conference
on Race Betterment, accord,
ing to reports received here. Her
name is Miss Sue Myrick, and she
hails from\ the classic town of Milledgeville.
Miss Myrick is a student
1 in a physical culture school in Battle
Creek, Mich., and is a firm believer
in the theory of practical eugenics.
The eugenics registry will include
a list of human thoroughbreds?men
and women who measure up to a very
high standard of mental and physical
narfoptinn Miss Mvrick is said to be
a beautiful girl and a great athlete.
The National Conference on Race
Betterment has proposed, by popularizing
the registry, to encourage a
broad interest in matters of health
and thus upbuild an aristocracy of
health in the United States.

Greenville, April 12.?The Parker
Cotton Mills company will profit to
the extent of $500,000 through the '
death of Lewis W. Parker, organizer
of the company and its president until

life insurance in a number of
companies, naming the Parker Cotton
Mills company as his beneficiary, the
total amount of the policies being, according
to a very reliable authority,
$500,000. Mr. Parker took out this 1
insurance about four yeai'3 ago. The
company has been paying the premiums.
Mr. Parker was given a very
rigid physical examination and pass- *
ed it very successfully. There was at

growth in his jaw, which de:
veloped only about two years later,

not deter the Lexington officer in his
i course after the men. The dog was
one of the best young man trailers in
the country, and was leading the
! pack at the time he was shot down. 1
, Sheriff Miller is of the opinion that
I V
had not the dog been killed or if the ,
Columbia parties would have permit- ?
i ted their dogs tb continue on the 1
j trail of the men after the leading ,
dog was shot, the men would have ,
been captured. Sheriff Miller stated
today that he intended setting him ,
another dog as soon as possible.
SIXTH ESCAPE PLAN FAILS.
Discovery of German Spy's Plan to 1
Break Jail.
' New York, April 15.?Two keepers
guarding Ignatius T. T. Lincoln,
self-confessed German spy, in the
Raymond street jail, Brooklyn, have
been dismissed for alleged complicity
in plans fliade by Lincoln to make <
another escape, it was announced today
by Commissioner Lewis, of the
department of corrections. Lincoln,
who is in jail awaiting federal -court
decision on the matter of an application
for his extradition to England
on a charge of forgery, escaped from
jail some time ago and was recaptured.
He boasted that he would escape
again.
The two keepers dismissed are
Thos. W. Danbeck and# Michael G.
Keating, who were given a trial by
Commissioner Lewis on charges'"
based on a confession made by Lincoln.
The attempt was to be made
on April 1.
Lincoln's plans provided that "a
well known gang leader" was to be
in charge of the jail delivery. This
leader and another man were to come
to the prison at night in the guise
of federal officers with a prisoner.
Six confederates were to be concealed
inside and as the keeper opened
the door these men were to cover
"lim with revolvers, bind and gag :
Mm. '
Other keepers were then to be 1
called into the warden's office sep- ]
arately and bound and gagged. The ]
last keeper called was to have been 1
compelled to open the cells. :

Who Taught Miss Keller? t

all, should 2,000 people assemble in t
New York to hear Miss Helen Keller
say that, in the event of invasion, t
the American workman "has nothing 1
to lose but his chains?" He has his (
manhood to lose, and it should mean }
as much to him as to any millionaire t
in the land. What new and debili- 1

that personal honor is the exclusive
attribute of wealth, and that a labor- c

NTERS THE NINTH WEEK
JIG ANTIC BATTLE OF VERDUN
CONTINUES UNABATED.
AKsses Estimated at 350,000 Men
2KO,000 Men Used as Reinforcements.
The most gigantic conflict in the
listory of the world, the battle ol
/erdun, has entered upon its nintt
veek. It is in many respects withoui
Jrecedent. The enormous scale o!
he German preparations and execu
;ion of the attack, the unparallelec
concentration of artillery and the
justained ferocity of the fightinf
nark the battle as one of the great
sst efforts of the war.
The French Keystone of Defense.
Verdun has been rated as one o:
:he strongest fortresses of Europe, i
jorner-stone of the French defense!
against Germany. The evolution o
military tactics during the war, how
*ver, and particularly the employ
ment by the Germans of long-rang*
lowitzers capable of reducing th<
greatest forts, have done much t<
change the character of the Verdui
campaign as compared with thi
earlier conceptions of what such j
struggle might be. Before the battl*
opened, the French partly disman
Lied their forts around Verdun an*
here, as elsewhere, on the variou
fronts chief reliance for resistant
was placed on an elaborate system o
trenches.
Loss of About 350,000 Men.
In no previous battle were the loss
es so high as those which have beei
sstimated in the fighting around Ver
dun. These estimates, however, cai
not be regarded as conclusive evi
dence, for neither Germany no

declared the Germans have lost 200,
000 in killed, wounded and captured
The Germans state semi-officially tha
the French casualties number 150,
000 killed and wounded and that 36,
000 unwounded Franch prisoner
have been taken. If these estimate
are approximately correct, nearl
400,000 men have been eliminate*
as fighting units.
The ground occupied by the Ger
mans after 56 days of offensive opera
tions may be roughly calculated a
100 square miles. They have force
back the French from their outlyin:
positions to their definite line of re
sistance along the semi-circular fron
from the edge of the Argonne east
ward across the Meuse and south
ward into the Woevre. For the mos
part this main line has withstood th
shock of successive attacks. The Gei
mans captured Fort Douaumont earl
in the campaign and have bitten int
French defenses at Dead Man'6 Hi
and elsewhere, but at no point hav
they succeeded in breaking througt
Used 280,000 as Reinforcements.
The Verdun drive was begun o
February 21st by the German arm
under Crown Prince Frederick Wi
liam. The Germans are reported t
have brought up seven army corps c
about 280,000 men, to reinforce th
troops which had been in servic
there, and subsequently, according t
French accounts, other large bodie
of reserves were called in. After a
unparalleled artillery bombardmem
the infantry attack was launched. A
unofficial French estimate placed th
number of attacking Germans i:
some sectors at 17,600 men to th
linear mile.
With the first ten days of battl
the French lost Haumont, Samog
neux, Brabant, Ornes, Beaumont

Champneuville and numerous oute
positions, including villages, woods
heights and fortified farms, togethe
with the fortified works of Hardau

the Meuse and north and northeas

Fighting continued intermittently

veek, centering in the struggle foi

Savannah, Ga., April 18.?Three
strange men, said to be Germans,
but whose names could not be learned,
were arrested today at Hardeville,
S. C., at the instigation of
Lieut. A. P. Cronkhite, United States
engineer corps, who suspected them
' of espionage, according to long distance
telephone messages received
1 here from Lieut. Cronkhite. A
' search or the prisoners ciotmng, it
was said, revealed the fact that they
l were in possession o fmaps, giving
minute details of fortifications and
^ roads along this section of the coast,
' and that they carried an elaborate
photographic camera.
A charge of vagrancy, on which
the men were taken into custody,
was changed to a charge of being

the three produced $5,000 to dis1
prove vagrancy charges.
Lieut. Cronckhite, in charge of a
