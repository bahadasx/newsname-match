from the visiting Klamath Falls
teams last Friday evening in two
well-played games of the great Indoor
sport.
The Ashland boys played a game
60 per cent better than on Wednes
day evening and scored almost at
will. The final score was 42 to 8 In
favor of the locals. Grlsez starred
as usual for Ashland, while Houston,
the diminutive little Klamath for
ward, scintillated for the visitors.
Beaver substituted In the last few
minutes for Fraley and threw three
baskets for Ashland.
Girls Win.
The Ashland girls played a tie

Ashland Escapes
Big Snow Storm
The entire northwest is In the grip
of one of the biggest snow storms of
recent years. The thermometer is
down below freezing in many parts of
the state and Portland has been suf
fering from the cold attendant upon
a temperature of 10 above zero,
which, is going some for that city.
Several inches of snow fell in Port
land and over almost the entire state.
Ashland for some peculiar reason has
escaped most of the snow and the
ground has barely been covered for a
few hour's at a time. While the
youngsters are enjoying coasting on
Three Empress Acts
And Two-Reel
Play
On Wednesday of this week the
Vining Theatre will show the three
strongest features of the Empress
vaudeville bill. Prices will be 35
cents on the lower floor and 25 cents
anywhere in the balcony; children 15
cents. In addition to the three acts a
William Fox feature picture of five
reels will be shown. The picture will
begin about 7:30, vaudeville 8:20
and close with pictures, the entire
show lasting about two hours.
The three headline acts of the Em
press bill will be here.
The Marlott troupe of two men and
three women present a whirlwind
juggling act with a sensational fin
ish. They juggle everything from a
bicycle to a buggy.
The Juvenile Kings, three little
girls and a boy, ranging In age from
10 to 16 years, furnish one of the
most delightful acts which have ever
covered the Empress circuit. The
children have been on the stage two
seasons and act like veterans.
Then last but not least is May
Belmont and Mattie Harl, billed as
"The man, the girl and the piano."
They give a pleasing singing and
playing act which is said to be a win
ner. Remember, three big acts, a five

W. A. Freeberg returned this
morning from a four months' stay in
southern California, three months of
which was spent at Los Angeles. Mr.
Freeberg says that just before he
left he went out and watched them
knock snow off the orange trees,
which were In bloom, and that the
weather In the southland was far
more disagreeable than it is in Ash
land. He was delighted to find the
sun shining upon his arrival here, and
says it is the first good look he has
had at the sun for many days as it
was cloudy or hazy when it was
raining in Los Angeles and in San
Francisco, where he spent a week en
route home. Mr. Freeberg will re
main in Ashland for an indefinite
period and may stay through the sum

not a hydraulic engineer to under
stand. However, anyone who has sat
beside that gushing stream of water
for two hours can understand that
Ashland has a supply of Lithia water
which will supply any possible needs
for years to come.
The lithia water as it comes from
the pipe Is much more heavily
charged with gas than at the spring,
this being explained by Mr. Emery
as being due to the fact that the wa
ter is taktn from the pump far below
the surface and the weight of the
water on top holds in a greater pro-
lortion of gas.
Mr. Smith informs us that when
the fountains are connected up it
will be necessary to run the pumps
only at low speed and possibly not at
all part of the time, and that he will
advise blowing off the pipes every
day as the six miles of pipe four
inches in diameter will hold more
water than the people of Ashland
could drink in a week.
While having no fears as to the
ultimate success of all of the plans,
Mr. Smith stated that the problem of
piping in the gas was the hardest of
all, and that it was with the greatest
satisfaction that be had witnessed
the successful consummation of the
gas line plan. A volume of gas Is
now pumped through the pipes which,
like the lithia, is more than can be
used, A strong current of gas hisses
out of the pipe, and is so strong as to
eral Instances workmen have been
obliged to quit work on account of
tho funics. The gas Is so cold as to
almost freezo tho fingers If held over
the mouth of the pipe for a few min
utes. The soda water is also coming
through in fine shape and the sul
phur water has been flowing at the
cave spring for two weeks and is now
pronounced by even those with the
strongest of Imaginations to be ab
solutely free of the pipe taste.
When asked concerning possible
breakdowns, Mr. Smith said: "I can
best answer that query by comparing
this p'ant to a high-priced automo
bile. Like the automobile, It Is of
the best, mechanical construction and
has delicate and complicated parts of
high tension machinery. Liko the
automobile, it may happen that de
fects In material or adjustment may
cause trouble once or twice when
first operated, but, these remedied,
the machinery, as long as it gets the
best of care, will run smoothly until
worn out parts require replacing."
Mr. Smith states that in his
opinion It will keep one man busy
taking care of tho station and mak
ing daily rounds of the pumps and
fountains, oiling and adjusting and
carefully watching tho machinery.
"And it should be a man who under
stands his business and will watch
his business," stated the company
head.
The fountains will be completed in
the next week or so, and by the time
they are ready for the water all vest
ige of new pipe taste will have disap
peared.
To C. A. Dell, engineer in charge,
must bo given the greatest credit for
the substantial construction and suc
cessful solution of the manv engi
neering problems attendant upon the
construction of the physical plant.
Smith, Emery & Co. in accomplish
ing the mobilization of lithia, soda
and .sulphur waters from distances
ranging up to six miles from Ashland,
and in the piping In of the carbon
dioxide gas, have accomplished a feat
of engineering and construction
which has never before been accom
plished and which was proclaimed by
some of the big engineers of the
country to bo imjiossible. Overcom-
ng numberless obstacles !n engineer
ing and construction, blazing new
paths in science where they were no
footprints to follow, they have per
sistently overcome adverse conditions
and have completed a monument to
their engineering reputation. Ac
cording to Mr. Smith, the company
has not made any financial gain and,
In fact, consider themselves lucky to
have broken out even on the contract.
Ashland owes to this company a deep
debt of gratitude. Smith, Emery &
Co. have built, and built well, a sub
stantial foundation for the greatest
watering resort in America.

Ashland Will Be
Mecca for Thousands
Candidates Being
Heard From
"The call of the people" Is being
heard by many throughout Jackson
county and already, from the lower
valley especially, "honorable men
tions" of candidates are becoming as
numerous as bees around a sugar bar
rel. Up in this district but little in
terest Is evident as yet, and what lit
tle fire is burning is kept smothered
under until the right time to let it
burst into flames.
The sheriff's office Is the greatest
magnet. It is understood that Sher
iff William Singler will not run for
the office. Among those who avowed
and otherwise, slated as seekers after
the berth, are Deputy "Curly" Wil
son, now chief aide of Sheriff Sin
gler, County Assessor W. B. Grieve,
Sergeant Pat Mego of the Medford
police force, H. N. Lofland and A. W,
Walker, defeated at the last primar
ies for the office. All these would
seek the office on the republican
ticket. As the office Is the most re
munerative on the county list, there
tire probably other republicans and
democrats in ambush, awaiting a fa
vorable opportunity to show their in
clinations.
For county assessor O. Winter of
Ashland Is mentioned and would re
ceive good support in this end of the
county. Mr. Winter has had much
experience in the work and is well
qualified. E. M. Wilson of Medford
And J 'J Rllfr.tlAr mnnncar nf ttlA
California-Oregon Power Company at
Medford, are also mentioned.
County Clerk Gardner will be a
candidate for re-election and. Miss
Marian Towne of Phoenix, represent
ative to the state' legislature, is also
said to be a candidate for the county
clerk position. Chauncey Florey Is
In the field for re-election to the re
corder's office and as yet no other
applicants have made themselves
known. Treasurer Fred L. Colvlg is
not positive that he will run again,
but Frank Coleman, a deputy in tho
office, will run. An Ashland banker
is rumored to be in the field also.
Attorney E. D. Briggs and Attor
ney C. W. Moore of Ashland are both
talked of as possible prospects for
the prosecuting attorneyship. Judge
Kelly, present incumbent, and George
M. Roberts of Medford are both in
the field.
For the vacant county commislson-
ership several Ashlanders are talked
of, among them being Mayor John
son, Joe Hurt, G. S. Butler, Benton
Bowers and others. In all probability
one candidate will be decided upon
from this district who will receive the
backing of the southern end of the
county. Any one of the above gentle
men and several other possibilities
would receive the support of the com
munity. F. V. Medynski of Medford
and Colonel Sargent of Jacksonville
are also being boosted for the place.
The primary will come In April and
within the next month a much more
definite lineup .will probably become
evident. At any rate the county
campaign promises to be a hot one.
That Ashland will be the Mecca for
thousands from the valley and thou
sands from points along the Southern
Pacific between San Francisco and
Portland, seems assured by the ready
response which has already been
aroused to the announcement of tent
ative plans for tho greatest celebra
tion which Ashland and the valley
have ever known on the 3rd, 4th and
5th of July next.
A committee from the Commercial
Club will be appointed immediately
to lay preliminary plans, and the big
gest event which Ashland now looks
forward to Is the formal dedication
of Llthla Fark and the attendant
celebration. By July the lawns and
shrubbery In the park will be at their
best and every property owner In the
city should immediately begin to get
his property dressed up for the occa
sion. Ashland will probably enter
tain fifteen to twenty Thousand visit
ors during the three days' celebra
tion, and well-kept lawns, tidy
houses, park rows, flowers and plenty
of fresh paint wherever needed will
make a big difference in the appear
ance of tho city.
Of course, plans for the ceelbratlon
are as yet in an embryotlc state, but
it seems assured that the Shriners
will hold a big ceremonial In con-
Junction with the celebration, the
Chautauqua Is planning to have Pro
fessor Larimore here for some time
before the celebration and take
charge of an Immense children's pa
geant, the Civic Improvement Club
is planning a sweet pea show, the
regular session of the Southern Ore
gon Chautauqua will closely follow
the celebration, and many will re
main for this session. Accommoda
tions will be provided for several
times as many campers as have ever
camped in Ashland parks before, and
special Imitations extended through
commercial clubs and auto clubs to
members everywhere to come and
camp. Dozens of special features
will be formulated as soon as organ
ization is perfected, tho whole cele
bration centering around the dedica
tion of the new Lithia Park and the
$100,000 mineral water mobilization
plant. It is hoped that it may be
possible to have Governor Withy

Rand Retained
Association Mgr.
The first meeting of the new board
of directors of the Ashland Fruit &
Produce Association was held at the
association office January 10, 1916,
at which time the following were
elected: President, John H. Dili;
secretary, William Tavener; treas
urer, V. O. N. Smith. D. E. Rand,
the former manager, was retained
for the year 1916. The new presi
dent, J. H. Dill, has been in Ashland
about a year and owns a fruit ranch
in the western outskirts of Ashland.
He is a retired attorney and business
man and has already won the respect
and admiration of a large circle of
Ashland friends. Mr. Tavener, the
new secretary, Is an old Ashland res
ident who has kept in close touch!
with the fruit marketing problem
here and has always been a booster
for co-operation among the fruit
growers. Treasurer V. O. N. Smith,
is cashier of the Citizens Bnnk nml

character and business worth aro
known to every resident of Ashland
and vicinity. Mr. Rand, despite ad
verse conditions during the past year,
handled tho affairs of the association
tives from most of the cities between iwith results which have proved him
Portland and San Francisco here for
tho dedication.
It will take the united co-operation
of every man, woman and child in
Ashland to carry through this event
as it should be carried through and
will be carried through.
Ashland will have natural attrac
tions and artificial attractions su
perior to any, but to add the crown
ing feature Ashland must permeate
an enveloping warmth of hospitality
which will perpetuate her reputation
not only as "The Carlsbad of Ameri
ca" but as "The most hospitable little
city on the Pacific Coast." To do
this will take the best that is in the
character of every Ashlander.

er, where he had established a fine)
reputation In the fruit-marketing
business.
For the first time In years the fruit
growers of Ashland and vicinity seem
to be in total harmony, and great
things are looked forward to because
of this harmonious feeling. The big
problem In the past In this district
has been marketing. Ashland fruit
will admit inferiority to none. The
members of the Fruit A Produce As
sociation are fortunate in having se
cured men of the calibre of those who
head their organization, and by given
their continued backing may be as
