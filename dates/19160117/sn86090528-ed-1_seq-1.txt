nse of 7 years. I'pou his removal irrn
Kansas to Chickashi he transferred his
membership to the First Presbyterian
church of this city, Biul remained an
nctio and a consis-tant member to
the hour of hU death.
One of the p'.ovsures of Jacob
Good's life lay in the Bible class, or
class of boys which he taught in the
.Sunday school of his church. He was
ever devising some means cf enter
tainment for those lads, and was with
them on an outing when he was
drowned. Last summer he gave the
hoys a week's outing at Medicine Park
and was planning another outing, to
be enjoyed by the boys for a week
during the coming summer.
It has ben arranged Tor the mem
hers of the Commercial Farm bureau
1 pieet at the office of that, Institu
tion and march in a body to the ehuf h
nt. 3 o'clock. Thone message have
been sent to the 4." or r0 farmers who
live upon the lands owned and con
trolled by Mr. Good during his life, to
meet with the members of the commer
cial and farmers bodies and attend
tlie funeral.
Mr. Good owned and controlled be
tween eight and ten thousand acres
of land lying mostly in Grady county
He was with the men who operated
these farms the greater part of his
time and was known personally and
beloved by all of them. During the
hard year" of 1911, it is said, Mr. Good
ne ver pressed a farmer who lived upon
his land. On the contrary, he is said
to have stood by each of them during
that season cf crop failures and gen-
and depression and to have proved
himself, thereby, both a man and a
brother.
In addition to his efforts in the mat
ter of advancing the agricultural in
leresls of the entire county, Mr .Good
took particular delight in his church
work and devoted much of his sparo
time to making life pleasant to boys of
today who are to be the men of tomor
row. Outings, as stated above, were
frequently planned and it was while
carrying out one of those little pleas
ure trip fcr the boys that Mr. Good
met his death.
Saturday, morning, leaving Chtcka
fcha between 9 and 10 o'clock in the
morning Mr. Good took four of the
boys of his Sunday school class in
his auto nnd left for a day's hunting
and skating. Kenneth Teis, Cecil
Courtney, Walter White and John
Bradley were of the party.
The first stop was made at the
Drown lake and a couple of hours
was decoted to skating on the Ice of
the lake and to hunting on the Island.
Shortly after 12 o'clock, noon, Mr.
Good told two of the boys to crank
the car and get ready to go across on
the river to spend the afternoon there
hunting. Cecil Courtney says the boys
experienced trouble in cranking .l:e
car and coming to the edge of the Ice
called to Mr. Good and told him or this
trouble. Mr. Good then toltl the boys
ho would crank the car, and started
skating toward the shores of the lake
When about twenty-five feet from the
bank the ice suddenly gave way be
nealh him, plunging the skater into
the icy water. Without loosing his
presence of mind Mr. Good called to
the boys and instructed them on bow
to proceed in their efforts of rescue.
PlanM were obtained and thrown ot.
the ice and the drowning man made all
elforti to raise himself to the surface
of the ice. The ice, however, contin
ually broke beneath Mr. Good's weight,
piunging hiin anew with each struggle
;nto the water.
It was then that Kenneth Teis r.how
ed his metal and demonstrated that
l.e was a boy willi cool and level held
aud wiln no bad ideas of executive
ability. Ilreaking the ice in front of
him, Kenneth waded into the cold water,-
of the lake as far as possible, go
ing ,ut until the waters all but met
above his head in his efforts to reach
and rescue his patron and friend.
Despairing of lifting himself to the
tee's surface, Mr, Good called for a

Gov. Ferguson's policies. It was con

In the Law ton game the Chickasha
Iine-"jp was as follows: Forwards,!
Louis Gardner and Walter G. Grif
fith; center, Oscar Harris; guards,
Dan Riddle and Geo. Snedeke-r. The
substitutes were Arthur Griffith and
Neil Fox, the former being unable to
play on account of a hurt knee. In
this game, it is said, the superior
science ot the locals was overcome
by the weight of their opponents. The
game was hotly contested and the re
sult might have been different had
the game been played here. The Law
ton high school gym contains six large
pillars, which botnered the Chicka
sha boys, but didn't seem to interfere
with the Lawton. players.
The game with the independent In
dian team at Anadarko was one of tho
hardest played by the Chickasha boys
this year. The locals were weakened
by tho absence of Gardner and Arthur
Griffith, who had to return home Sat
urday, but they had the benefit of the
playing of Coach Reeds. The first
halt W3s a walk-away for Chickasha,
ihe score being lfi to 0 at one time,
but it is claimed that the Indians re
torted to rough tactics in the second
half, which changed the tide of bat
tle. The Indians were more experienc
ed players, being graduates of Carlisle

for athletics.

OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., Jan. 17. .
Preferential primaries, a usury bill,
revenue measures, state prison Indus
tries, amendment of the highway law,
further appropriations to continue tha
two-cent fight and confirmation of sev
eral appointive nominations by thu
governor are some of the things to
be considered in the special session
of the legislature, which convened this
morning. The session was called by
Gov. Williams les than two weeks
ago.
Comparatively few matters will bo
taken up by the legislative body in this
session, which the governor expect.
to last les than 30 days, possibly three
weeks. Several members of the legis
lature, however, are convinced the bills
to be considered cannot be properly
prepared and discussed in tho tima
mentioned. -
Members ot the senate and house
have been co-operating for weeks on
the measures to be Introduced under
recommendation of the governor. Soma
of these will be started in the uppee
and some in the lower branch.
The election law, which Is consider
ed the chief reason for the session, will
be centered about the question of pre
ferential primaries. Gov. (Williams
is a strong advocate of the primaries
and it is considered probable Okla
homa will be enabled to express its
preference for tho various presidential
candidates this year by direct voto oil
the people, as a result ot the special
legislative sossion.
Appointments by the governor which
were to be presented to the senate for
confirmation include all the members
of the state board of education, board
of agriculture, Industrial commission,
mining board, board of pharmacy, elec
tion board, secretary ot the Insurance
board, highway commissioner, fire mar

$2.1,000 more is required to complete
the trial of those cases, ami mis

Several senators and representatives
have pet measures they desire to

is considered probable some ot these!
will be considered.
