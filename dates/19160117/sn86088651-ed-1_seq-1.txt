Afferent countries have adopted
different modes of training the anl

down beside a wounded man and bark
until asslstsnce came. Another, to
train the dog to return half way to

short, sharp bark, and yet another to
teach the animal to pick up some ob
ject belonging to the soldier, carry It
back to hia maater and guide the lat
ter to the spot where the man lies
awaiting help.
The first method haa been found to
be the quickest In practice, but at the
ssme time the most dangerous. Inas

the notice of th enemy, and may even
at time give hlra uaeful Information.
