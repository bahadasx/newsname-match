Rabbit stew, composed of the' car

residents in the foreign section of East
Bridgeport, is suspected to be iserved
to many - policemen at midnight .each
evening in. a restaurant on the East
Side. - .
'Cats have been reported stolen and
one week .ago one resident of East
Bridgeport reported the loss of a val
uable Angora. The police began an
investigation and irj ,the rear yard of
a restaurant, surrounded by several
tenement houses, have been found the
skins of six pussies with the head andl
tan intact. !THe cats throats, had been
cut and the skins thrown upon an ash
heap in the rear of the eating estab
lishment. " " ' '
; Policemen on the beats in the vicin
ity of the1 restaurant are wont to visit
the eating house about midnight each
evening and partake of their lunch.
Some believe a hot beef or , rabbit stew
is very refreshing on- cold nights when
they have to pound the pavement unfil
the - early morning hours. . .
It was suspected that they are
being " served with cat stew in
place 'of rabbit stew, as rab
bits . are very scarce. The hunt
ing season . closed a' short time
ago. The matter was reported to the
hoard of health a few days, ago and an
investigation has been started.
In the rear' , ofthe restajirant are
several tenement houses occupied by
poor families and it' may be possible
that' the animals are being used by
the families in the tenements. - It is
neculiar, however, that the skins were
found in the rear of the restaurant and
this place is under close 'surveillance
by the health irJBoectors.

Officials Admit Helplessness To Straighten Out
Worst Tie-Up New Haven Road Has Faced in )
History Can't Find Room For Cars, is Plea
' of Company Manufacturers of $tate in Con
ference With Official to Devise Means of
Clearing Up Muddle.
New Haven, , Jan. 47 No immediate prospect of relief from!
the present freight congestion on the Ne.w York, New Haven &(
Hartford railroad was held out by the road's operating- officials!
in a conference today with a number of representatives of in-:!
dustries here. 1 ' . ,
The officials made a plea for co-operative effort in getting 1
cars unloaded and freight moved away from the terminals.
They said that the road must do its share as "well and it is trying
to overcome conditions which the consignee, can in ho srnall
measure relieve if energetic action is taken. . v ..
. The-embargo made last week against less than car lots is
bringing baoik one class of freight to about normal and the em
bargo gives a ray of relief if it,; cn be maae .temporarily more
sweeping. The normal timexof two and seven-tenths days f or
umoaaing a car load nas risen to eignt days. . , ' i
General Manager Bardo declares that the road's , history
fails to show conditions of freight congestion as bad as at pres- ;
ent. TheWestern roads have not discriminated v against New!
England as a section, he declared 'further but the embargo of )
these roads was simply a step, they had to take because the New j
Haven could not handle the volume of business delivered to it i
at it$ gateways. ' ) .
Vice-President A. R. Whaley said
that the road Bad enough' motive
power. He did not want any more
engines blocking the ' tracks. It was
not a' matter of moving trains but of
finding room for cars.
The result- of this conference was
the naming of a committee by Morris
F-, Tyler, who 'presided to devise some
plan by. which New Haven manufac
turers may co-operate with the road
in handling cars; in the local yards.
The railroad officials then, went to a
conference.- -with? members bf . the
manufacturers' association represent
ing the several sections of the state,
for" a discussion of the same subject
To save time the discussion was while
lunch was being served.
At. the -first? conference Mr. Tyler,
addressing Vice-Presidents E.G. Buck
land, "A. R. Whaley and Benjamin
Campbell, and General Manager Bar
do, asked what theroad was doing to
relieve conditions and what co-operation
on the part of' the manufacturers
was needed. ' ' v
Mr. Buckland said- he could not
promise-immediate relief. , The heavy
run of freightis not bringing Wealth
to the road. In June last ,th.freight
traffic was worth $6.327,V00; -in No
vember,, $6,407. OOOj he December fig
ures are not available but , he did not
think they would show gains warrant
ed' by volume -of business. OnNov.
1 there were 4,485 cars to be moved
and on Jan. '1, 10,538. On June 15
there were 9,530- cars waiting to be
unloaded, on Jan. 16, 13,138. On June
5 there were 86,954 cars on the road's
tracks, and on Jan. 10," 96,347.
The trouble Is, he said, that whereas
in June cars were largely moving at
present they are jamming sidings and
available tracks. 5 The company has
borrowed 24 engines from other roads
tomOye trains. ' Up to - Dec. 1 the
road had 200 engines in reserve ready
for use. ' . "- . 4 , ' . .
These are all at work. The road's
payroll is increased $100,000 a month;
because it has been necessary to hire
2,500 extra men for handling freight.
In reply to questions Mr. Buckland
said the embargo was a general one
against New England arid the road
does not discriminate against any part
of the statej . , ,
What the road asked was a general
harmonious movement of alf con
signees to get freight out of cars. The
road, he said, is using its rolling stock
to the utmost. - ...
Mr.; Whaley said the condition de
veloped suddenly.) Other roads had it
and then they 'began to; shift the bur
den and quicklv fright was pouring
in at every - gateway faster than it
could be handled. The rush began in
December and then came two storms
to hamper. The elements have been
a factor. ' Two weeks of. good
weather will mean a lot to the road.
It has to be , remembered, said Mr..
Whaley, that the road 1 went from

it has ever known in a very' short i
time. ' ' x -x :
Mr. Whaley,' asked about the labor
problem, said that experienced men
can always do wonders but the sudden ,
expansion in the working force found
thousands of men who were' new to
their duties and it is taking time to I
train them. , .
He explained that sidings are being
put- in on all the divisions'" and there
is new .tracking, all the'work being of
emergency character, an greatest in
extent than "any one could have fore
seen. For instance? . in Waterbury
there are today 9 00 cars consigned
to, private sidings alone. Not only
has . the road . there used every foot t
of the land, it owns for trackage but!
it is buying more. . j
To: a question as to whether the '
present congestion is likely to recur ;
Mr. Whaley said he could not prophe-
sy but he did believe thqf road and in- ;
dustries should at once increase their
trackage facilities from 50 to 100 per ,
cent. . :
Vice-President Campbell spoke ' of j
the freight business.. Mr. Whaley said j
that coal was coming in very heavily, j
Mr. Bardo said it was 33 1-3 per cent.
of ' the total just now. Mr. Whaley-
said it looked to him as if people did j
not have , money last summer but are i
now buying their -coal., The road itself j
is using 68 watercraft; to get its own j
coali Mr. Campbell thought that it j
consignees can devise ways of getting
cars unloaded quickly, the road can j
begin moving- empties back to ' credi- J
tor roads, and this would bring relief;
quicker.
Mr. Bardo explained the Interchange
of cars under the American Railway i
Association's plaiv pointing: out that j
a road accepting fiseight has to fur- !,
nish if - possible its . own cars. A j
freight comes from outside New Eng- J
land, the bulk of freight delivered to
Is ew' Haven is in foreign cars. I
A railroad is like any other business, i
"o kuu, xxi ut-.mjK; nixucea to its pnysi-
ral capacity. Cars now waitinsr to
be unloaded cover fully 100 miles of
tracks. He said that if businessmen
put their . shoulder to - the wheel and
helped the road by .unloading. all toil
gether, he believed' t?jie road would!
be able to deliver cars quickly. 1

Headed by Frederick A. Bennett, i
secretary of the Bridgeport Manufac
turers' association a delegation of bus-
riness men of this city appeared in
New Haven today to argue with the
officials of the- New Haven road for
better' freight deliveries in this city.
The particular request that Bridge
port merchants make today does not
refer so much to freight congestion in
local ' railroad sheds, which has been
greatly cleared, i but rather that the
embargoes be taken off ' shipments
over the xoad in order that needed in
dustrial products and commodities
may be received in larger quantities.
