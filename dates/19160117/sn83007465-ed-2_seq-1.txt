Governor Manning's address "

> Gentlemen of the General As* %
** sembly J?
In my annual message I sta- ^
ted that I would transmit to ^
you a special message dealing u
with the State Hospital for the n
Insane. You have courteously ^
invited me to deliver this message
in person. Permit me to n
thank you for this privilege. jj
At the outset, I wish to state if
clearly that in referring to the e
conditions which I found there
when I became governor, it j;
must not be regarded as a personal
criticism, but rather a
statement of facts and condi- *
tions as I found them. I would be
disengemious if I did not make
a full statement to you of this
whole situation, and its needs. j
From personal observation. 0
I found last yc*ar, the physical a
condition of this institution to si
be intolerable, if we are to con- b
sidfcr the treatment of these un- e
fortunates as a solemn duty and tl
as jm act of humaneness and c,
chfrity. The treatment of
those patients was custodial, fi
rathe** than that of giving skill- s]
ed treatment to improve their %
condition of mind, as well as of k
body - IT
W This condition was fully re- cl
vealed to you in an exhaustive n
report made by Dr. Herring, w
last year, through me to you. 1 u
feel that it is unnecessary to h
repeat here what was stated in oi
that document. You, in a body,
at my invitation, visited that in- N
stitution then, and the condi- r<
tion as shown by that report, n
and by what you found there, tl
OAn\rin nCkA trnn Af tVin n noncia
vvr*? niv/vu J vu vi tnv ntwtnnii v ^ i
for reorganization of the inati- ti
tution, and a change in the t<
treatment of the inmates. I am ci
sure that you recall vividly the tl
picture of what you saw then. tl
Yesterday I invited you co C
visit again this institution so s1
that you could see fur your- ei
selves, in a measure at least, 1
what has been done, and is be- C
ing done, under the acts which ir
you so wisely passed at the last
session of the legislature. The rr
improvements in the physical p<
property are being carried on in h
a thorough and efficient manner u
and when this work is comple- 'S
ted I feel that it will be an en- A
during monument to your wis- ir
dom and humaneness in provid- h
ing for the comfort and the im- b<
proved treatment of these un- tl
fortunate citizens of our state, si
Last year you haw the wretch w
ed condition, the discomforts
and dirt in the cells in which di
these people were 'Xjnfined. ! tl
saw, and you saw, how the h
meals served were cold and un- ?
palatable. You saw ii> .he worn- ei
an's department, which was n
then the best department in
that institution, the silent wit- nr
nesses?those straps that were cl
around the walls, that were used
to resrain violent patients. "
Gentlemen, the temptation to
me is to go on and enumerate
the different things that were
revolting, but I have promised ,
you not to do so. But I can not V,
refrain from saying that in V
that women's ward and as the
ward that was then in best condifion,
you will recall that in
that ward for violent patients, k
there were 92 of those violent
subjects. They were confined r,
in cells. We found that the fire e
f protection was absolutely in- 0i
adequate and inoperative; we tl
K found the fire hose could not be. e<

Similar Decrees Issued and E*

Washington, Jan. 16.?Ger
Carranza today renewed his as
surances to the United State
that he would make every effor
to punish those responsible fc
the murders of Americans nea
Santa Ysabel.
A dispatch from Consul Sill
man, at Queretaro, to the stat
department said Carranza ha
personally assured Mr. Sillim?
in reply to the department's dc
mand that the murderers be ru
down, that he "had issued oi
ders for the immediate pursui
capture and punishment c
inose responsible tor the atr<
city."
The dispatch from Consi
Silliman follows:
"Department's telegram c
January 13. 5 p. m? massaci
Americans at Santa Ysabel, r<
ceived at 8:20, and implaced b<
fore Gen. Carranza by me i
person. Gen. Carranza said thr
he had already issued orders fc
the immediate pursuit, captui
and punishment of those r<
sponsible for the atrocity. H
stated that he believed this ou
rage was committed by men a:
sociated directly with Villa an
that it was done specially t
provoke international trouble
at this time. He said he had d<
clared those responsible outsid
the law, to be punished wit
death if caught.
"He appeals to the secretar
of state and to the public of th
United States to consider th
wide strip of the Cenral railwa
the great difficulty of guardin
the entire distance, and th
comparatively easy task of det
troying a train or attacking
small place. He says that n<
body can lament more than h
such an atrocity or be more cor
corned about it, but that prote(
tion is relative and that eve
in the best regulated (?) state
outbursts of disorders and law
lessness may cause destructio
of property and loss of life.
"He says he is expecting fu
reports from Gen. Trevino, an
that all efTorts will be made t
protect Americans and any otf
er foreigners who may be in th
district. His belief is the ma.'
sacre was made premediativel
by a band who fled at once afte
the raid."
Carranza's telegram today t
his embassy here follows:
"The government, under m
direction, has adopted ever
necessary measure to insur
the prosecution of an energeti
campaign for the capture an
destruction of the party of Vi
lista bandits, and to continu
the same to its complete accorr
plishment. I have asked Ger
Jacinto P. Trevino, commanc
ing the constiutionalist troop
in the neighborhood of the as
sassinations, to obtain for m
the names of the assailants i
order that a decree may be is
sued placing them outside th
pale of the law. When this i
done any citizen or citizens c
the republic will have the righ
to arrest the guilty partie
without warrant, and to ex?
cute them without formality.
"Similar decrees were issue

of the republic within the yeai
notably when a pass anger trai

in the opinion of the goverr

READY mPEACE
Submits to Unconditional Laying
Down of Her Arms
Against Invaders. '
BRITISH AND RUSSIANS
PRESSING THE TURKS
British Make Advances in Mesopotamia
and Russians
in the Caucasus.
Beset on the north, east and
west by Austro-Hungarian
armies and with all lines of retreat
cut off, except into Albania
where hostile tribesmen must
be faced, Montenegro has asked
Austria-Hungary for Peace
and her request has been
granted. The unconditional laying
down of arms by Montenegro
was made the basis of the
opening of peace negotiations,
and Montenegro accepted these
terms imposed by the dual
monarchy.
This announcement was made
to the Hungarian parliament by
Premier Tisza. and it was met
with an ovation on the part of
the members of the chamber.
Thus comes the first withdrawal
of any belligerent from either
of the alliances that have
been fighting with each other
since August, 1914.
It had been conceded for days
that the situation of Montenegro
was a critical one. Although
the army of the little kingdom
fought valiantly against the
Austro-Hungarians, it was unequal,
because of inferior forces
lack of guns and it has been
stated, a shortage in commissariat
supplies, to the task of
holding back the armies that
had, in conjunction with their
allies, succeeded in crushing
Serbia.
Already the Montenegrin
capital and many of its important
towns had fallen into the
hands of the Austro-Hungarians,
and the invaders were well
on their way to Montenegro's
chief seaport?Antivari. Last
accounts had the Montenegrin
government at Scutari. The
whereabouts of King Nicholas
is not known.
The British and the Russians
in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus
region, respectively, are
pressing the Turks hard. The
army of King George coming
northward from Persian gulf
to the relief of the British forces
at Kut-el-Amara, has driven
the Ottomans to within six
miles of he beleaguered town on
the Tigris.
i us ivuooians in incir urivt
along the front of nearly 100
miles in the Caucasus have won
additional points of vantage
from the Turks, especially in
the Arasa and Inid valley regions.
Constantinople admits
this, but says that south of the
Arasa in hand-to-hand fighting
in a Russian advanced position,
heavy casualties were inflicted
on the Russians by the Turks.
On the other fronts little
fighting of moment has taken
place. The British and French
guns in France and Belgium
have been busy bombarding
German trenches, while on the
Russian front there has been
fighing only at isolated points
from the Riga region to Bukowina.
According to he semi-official
Overseas News Agency of Berlin,
Entente Allied roops have
landed at Phaleron, a port five
miles southwest of Athens, and
once the port of the Greek
capital. The Berlin newspapers,
the news agency says, attribute
this as part of the preparations
inlooking to the overthrow of
ing of Eliphtherios Venizelos,
the former premier, who always
has sided with the endfente powers,
at the head of a Greek republic.
BUT ONE TENTH OF
AMERICANS LEAVING
El Paso, Texas, Jan. 17.?Approx-*
Imataly one hundred of a thousand
Americans and other foreigners who
remained in Chihuahua state after
the massacre at Santa Ysabel a week
ago todav were expected to arrive
here late tonight.
