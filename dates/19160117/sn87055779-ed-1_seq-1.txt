AMSTERDAM, Jan. 17. C.uns to
match the mighty, lone range how
itzers of the flennans. have ; last
reached the allies' front in Prance.
Chief interest here today centered in
the Cerman announcement that tho
British have bombarded Lille, using
a gun with a range estimated at 20
miles.
This is the first time that Uli
has been under artilb-ry fin since it
! fell into the hands of the CermanJ
j in September. 1 914.
clerman guns, with a rnnp1 of 2 0
i miles, which were used at bomtard
; ments of Dunkirk and Verdun, wer
i hitherto unmatched on the allies
side, but the latest developments
; show that the Germans must nov
i face equal metal.
It is regarded as significant that
the EnKÜsh make no announcement
of the shelling of T.ille while the
French war ofi'ue states that the
lalle highway was shelled. Th Ger
man war nfiice announces that pro
jectiles fell in the center of the
city.
