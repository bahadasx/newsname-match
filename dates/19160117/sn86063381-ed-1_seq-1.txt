Fosston High School in Fas, Game
Defeats Local Quint Score is
Disputed.
JOHNSON AND TANNER
ARE INELIGIBLE
Not in Sixth District Result Does
Not Affect State High School
Championship.
(By Special Correspondent.)
Fosston, Minn., Jan. 17.Fosston
26, Bemidji 19.
This was the result according to
some scorers of the first game of the
season played by the Bemidji high
school basket ball team Saturday
night. The game was played here
and much closer resembled football
than basket ball.
At a Disadvantage.
The Bemidji boys appeared to be
at a disadvantage on account of the
small floor, but regardless of this
fact, both teams did excellent work
and until the last minute of play
neither side was sure of victory.
Stars Out of Game.
The ineligibility of Johnson and
Tanner on account of class work was
probably the chief cause of the de
feat for Bemidji. Around these two
stars the Bemidji machine has been
built and without these players the
other players appear at loss. Tan
ner may be able to play next week
but Johnson will probably be unable
to play for several weeks.
Not in District.
The result of the game Saturday
evening will not affect Bemidji's
chances for the state title as Fosston
is not in the Sixth district. Be
midji's chances for the title with
Johnson and Tanner in the game
have been much improved by the
withdrawing from the race of the
Red Wing high school quint. Red
Wing won the championship last
year.
Tense With Excitement.
_The game^Saturday night.. was_
tense with excitement. Fosston se
cured the jump when Bakkum shot
a short basket during the first min
ute of play. The Bemidji boys tight
ened their defensive, but not until
after Wynne of Fosston had thrown
a marker. A spurt of fast playing
put a credit of one basket to Be
midji. This was soon followed by
a free throw made by plummer. The
ball zig-zagged back and forth, each
team making baskets. The first half
ended with the score 13 to 10.
Many Fouls Called.
The second half was very thrilling
despite the fact that numerous fouls
halted the play. Fogelberg was re
placed by Lade at guard. Bemidji
on the opening of the half crept up
within one point of the Fosston score
when Warfield made a sensational
shot. Cameron after a short dispute
was barred from the game through
personal fouls. Gainey took Bail
ey's place at guard, Bailey went to
Warfield's position at forward and
Warfield took Camerons' place at
center.
Bailey is Barred.
Bemidji resumed the aggressive
after the change and succeeded in
getting another basket when Bailey
was barred for committing personal
fouls. Tanner being the only Be
midji substitute threatened to go in
when the scorekeeper discovered his
mistake and Bailey was allowed to
continue.
The balance of the game was
brilliantly played by both teams but
Bemidji was unable to raise the
score on account of Fosston's de
fensive. The second half ended in
favor of Fosston, the finaly score be
ing 26 to 19.
The Bemidji boys played an ex
cellent game and the new men fill
ing the positions of Tanner and John
son played with accuracy.
Fosston Plays Good.
Fosston deserves much credit for
the game. They had good teamwork
and were accurate in passing. Their
floorwork at times was excellent.
The defensive playing of the Foss
ton team saved many baskets from
the Bemidji score.
Score Disputed.
A dispute in the score divided the
opinion. One score was Fosston 28
instead of 26, the extra basket being
thrown after the whistle had blown.
Another score awarded Plummer
three baskets in place of two, mak
ing the Bemidji score 21.
All in all it was a good, fast game
but with Johnson and Tanner in
the game the score would have been
altogether different.
The summary:
Bemidji Fosston
Plummer rf Wynne
Warfield If Bakkum

COUNTY OPTION
TEST CASE UP
Supreme Court Hears Arguments on
Whether Home Rule Super
sedes County Rule.
(By Special Correspondent.)
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 17.Whether
cities under home rule charters may
issue liquor licenses within counties
which have voted dry under the
county option law was argued today
before the Minnesota supreme court.
The case is from Koochiching
county where the International Falls
council was restrained by a tempor
ary injunction from issuing saloon
licenses. Koochiching county voted
dry under the county option law last
August.
The city council attempted to issue
licenses, the drys asked for a re
straining order and it was granted
by Judge W. S. McClenahan of
Brainerd. The city appealed the
case to the supreme court.
It was argued that the state con
stitution gives home rule governed
cities and villages the same privil
eges as counties.
Judge Marshall A. Spooner of Be
midji is representing International
Falls. BELTRAMI LIFER
ASKS FOR PARDON
Meeting of State Board at Capitol
Next Wednesday to Consider
Applications.
Merton S. Munn, who was sen
tenced in Beltrami county in Sep
tember, 1907, to death for murder
in the first degree and whose sen
tence was commuted in January,
1908, to life imprisonment, has made
an application for pardon. His case
will be considered next Wednesday
by the state pardon board.
Munn was sentenced to hang by
Judge McClenahan for the murder
of August Franklin in the Home res
taurant in Spooner in May, 1907. At
the time of the murder Munn was a
partner in the restaurant business
with the wife of Franklin with whom
the husband accused Munn of being
intimate.
In his application for pardon Munn
sets up the claim of self-defense.
The state board will consider 105
applications Wednesday.

STATE TO ASK U. S.
FOR ITASCA PARK LAND
C7 L. Hilton,'"'assistant-attorney'
general, has gone to Washington, ac
cording to word received here to
day from St. Paul, to present a claim
to the United States land commis
sioner for 1,600 acres of land in the
Itasca State park. Congress in 1892
granted all lands within the park
limits to the state of Minnesota, but
the Immigration Land company
claims title to this land from the
Northern Pacific road which selected
it as indemnity under its land grant.
Mr. Hilton's claim is that the land
had been included in a list, but the
list had not been approved by the
government before the act of 1892
was passed and therefore the title
should go to the state.
