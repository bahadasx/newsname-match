Zero weather is forecasted for Har

The mercury last night dropped to -
10 degrees, the record so far for the!
season. Light snow fell for several ,
hours last evening and the temper- J
ature fell rapidly after midnight.
Skating at the upper and lower end
of Wildwood Lake was declared safe
10-day by the Department of Parks,
but the red flag will not fly until the
neck of the lake freezes tight enough
for skating at that point. Crowds of
skaters enjoyed the pleasure of gliding
over the smooth surface yesterday and j
to-day and the continued cold weather j
predicted will soon xnake the entire,
lake safe, it is believed.
The river remained open until late |
this afternoon, but was filled with i
floating ice. Should the cold wave con- j
tinue without much rise in temper- |
ature. the river is expected to close.
Pair and slightly warmer weather I
forecasted for to-morrow will continue
another day, it is believed, and may be I
followed by snow. The full intensity j
of the cold wave moving eastward has |
not reached this point, but it has i
> attsed a general drop in temperatures !
in this section of the country. With
zero weather forecasted for the city j
to-night, in the smaller towns the mer- ;
<■ ury will probably go several degrees

Want Volunteers For
Plunge Into Icy River
Details for the celebration of
Epiphany Wednesday by members of
the Bulgarian colony in Steelton
will be completed at a meeting of
prominent, members of the Bulgarian
orthodox Church at the home of
D. Minoff. 476-478 Myers street.
The principal arrangement will con
sist of obtaining volunteers to plunge
into the Susquehanna to rescue a cross
which will be hurled into the stream
by Father David N'akoff. This Is one '
of the most important features of the
celebration and even the below-zero j
weather predicted for Wednesday will
not deter several Bulgarian swimmers
from the plunge into the freezing
waters.
Epiphany is celehratod at this time
by the Bulgarians because they adhere
to the Eastern faith, which differs
from the Roman belief in many re
spects, and their calendar is just thir
teen days behind that of the Roman
Church .

City Planners and

Confer on Subway
Another conference of the City
Planning Commission. City Engineer
M. B. Cowden and the Pennsylvania
railroad officials was held late this af
ternoon on the Market street subway
project.
The railroad officials, it is under
stood, wish the plans recently submit
ted to Council by City Engineer Cow
den, so changed as to allow an addi
tional fifty feet of track room. This
would mean an extension of the sub
way and a consequent extension of the
subway approach, westwardlv. The
proposed alteration would bring the
top of the western approach about
opposite the entrance to Union Station.
The. cost of the change would ho
greater and the consequential dam
ages to which the city would be sub
jected naturally would be higher,
j The Philadelphia and Heading
[ 1 tall-road Company. It is understood,
[has declined to pay any portion of
the cost of the proposed widening of
I the subway. The Philadelphia and

Company has not yet expressed its
I opinion on the question of assuming
I a certain share of the cost.

The ordinance officially went Into

license has been issued. This was
granted to Augustus Wildman, Jr., a
son of representative Wildman.
Twenty-four others, however, took
out application bianks, but to dato
they have not been filed. It is under
stood that these applicants preferred
to await the result of their confer
ence with the city commissioners to
morrow before taking further action.
The jltneymen asked for a hearing
several days ago and Council agreed
to discussion of the subject to-mor
row. Whether or not the measure
will be amended is questionable al
though it is generally believed in city
circles that no changes will be made.
Council to-morrow will pass finally
upon the resolution introduced a week
ago which change*' the meeting hour
I from 1 o'clock in the afternoon to 10
o'clock in the morning. The change
will be authorized in all probability
as the commissioners think a morning
meeting will give them more of an
opportunity to devote pructlcully a
full day to their departments.
One ordinance is on the calendar
for second and final reading. This is
Mayor Meals' measure conferring the
authority of policemen upon the tiro
drivers, chauffeurs, engineers and oth
ers in the city employment as lire
men. Mayor Meals' contention is
that these men can readily serve ;is
emergency patrolmen at fires and if
necessary may be sworn in for ten
day periods.
