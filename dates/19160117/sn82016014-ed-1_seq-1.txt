Berlin, Jan. 17. The king
and the government of Monte
negro on January 13 asked a
cessation of hostilities and open
ing of peace negotiations, it was
announced by Austro-Hungar-ian
headquarters today.
The Austro-Hunarian gov
ernment replied to Montenegro
that peace negotiations were
only possible if the Montenegrin
army unconditionally laid down
its arms, the headquarters
statement as received here from
Vienna, says.
The Montenegrin govern
ment, adds the statement, yes

conditions.

cloned all plans of participation in tho
Kalkan campaign and s preparing to
evacuate Albania, according to advices
received here today.
The Serbian forces in Albania will
bo withdrawn leaving th? Montene
grins to be crushed between the Aus
trian armies on the north and the
Bulgars on the south, if they escape
into Aloania. Oeneral Koevess is try
ing to make an Austrian campaign in
Albania unnecessary by cutting off the
Montenegrin retreat and bagging King
Nicholas' entire armv. j
Italian patrols sent northwarl from i
Avlona after the Italian landing at
thai pore, are being withdrawn The
Austrian eovern merit learned this
from Albania ns, however. The Serbs
west of Klbassan are again in retreat
before the 1 "lulgars and are expected
to reach the Adrialie coast within an
other fortnight. Before the end of
another month the whole Albanian as
well as M ontenegrin armies may be
in the hands of the Austrian and Bul
garian troops.
A n A ust rian force is approaching
A nt ivaria, M on te negro's only seaport,
but 17 mil3.' from Scutari, to which
place the Montenegrin government of
ficials retreated after the capture of
their capital. Another force pushing
eastward across southern Montenegro,
has captured Podgaritza and is mov
ing to close the ring now almost com
pletely drawn about the Montenegrin
force.
The Italian decision i evacuate
Albania is paid to have been arrived at
after a long conference between the
Italian king and his military chiefs.
King Victor Rmmanuel is said to have
favored the landing of a larger army
on the Albanian coast and an attempt
to drive the Austrians from Monte
negro. His generals advised against a
scattering of the Italian forces and
favored a concentration against the
Austrian frontier. They argued that
the Italians, if victorious, could loose
Austria's hold on Montenegro and Al

Claxton came to Topeka last May

the explosion within the hull of the
submarine E-Z In the New torn nary
yard Saturday by which four men were

electrician of the J-2; John Halsey,

advisory board. Mr. Hutchinson said
he formed a tentative cause of the de
struction after making an Investiga
tion and that he saw no reason t
recommend any changes In the Edlsoa
battery.

conducting the two inquiries civil
and naval into the cause of the K-l

four men and serious injuries to tea
others, are convinced the accident was
due entirely to natural causes. They
were giving no consideration to the
