Gct out the ear muffs!
Zero weather is promised Wash
ington tonight for the first time in
two years.
Being the greatest convention city
in the country, Washington is en
tertaining today what is practically
a convention of cold waves repre
senting all the talent in that direc
tion in both the extreme North and
the extreme South, borne into the
city ion the wings of a stiff north
breeze, which was inspired by a
severe storm from the Gulf of Mex
ico and added to by the cold wave
from the Northwest and another
from the vicinity' of Hudson bay.
The thermometer commenced play
ing queer tricks this morning, to
emphasize the presence of extreme
weather conditions. At 8 o'clock this
morning 17 was registered at the
Weather Bureau. But the appear
ances of the sun did not send it up.
Instead the mercury began to go
down, and by 10:30 o'clock had
reached the mark of 12. The sun
got in its best licks about this time
and started the temperature up
again, the mark of 16 having been
reached by 1 o'clock.
The last zero temperature regis
tered in this city was on February
25, 1914, when one degree below was
reached for a brief period.
A let up in the cold is not prom
ised until Wednesday and that is
only promised in a half-hearted way.

In a House resolution Introduced today

hiIo other House members are

believes the situation may bo met

lutely the sale of tho product at the

posed tax would fall on the original

Tho deaib order Was also carried out
when Gen. Manuel Baca Valles and

Valles was known aa Villa's official

Generals Rlvas and Alamelda, of tho

While soldiers of tho de facto gov

Mexico la in progress today. Three

report that a train from Parral, in

This train was held up for the arrival

At the same time, the department re
ceived a telegram from Consul Thomai
D. Kdwards at Juarez connrmlng state
ments attributed to him that he hag
asked for protection ot the mining prop

request of tne State Department.
Officials of the department, seeking'
still to stand by previous statements of
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing that the Americans had gone Into
the Santa Ysabel district despite warn
ings to keep out. declare that tho pro
tection asked for the properties of the
Oust Mining Company did not mean
protection for the Uvea of Americans
who might go there to operate them.
There is stilt a difference of opinion
among high officials of tho department
as to whether or not Edwards received
