Washington, Jan. 17. Feeling over

Americans last week was allayed to
day by the tone of Genernl Carranza's
assurances to Consul SIHtman placing
the murderers' outsldo tho pale of the
law. This docree, promising sharp
action, practically authorizes any one
to shoot down the ihandlts at Bight.
At the same time, Carranza'B.np
peol for consideration of the difficul
ties confronting Mm In controlling
the bandits found sympathetic re
sponse In official circles. This plea Is
expected to gain support for the ad

Carronza a chance to demonstrate his
power to punish marauders and to

MONTENEGRO SEEKING
PEACE WITH AUSTRIA
King Nicholas Is First of the Allied Monarchs to Break
From the Ranks, and to Escape the Fate of Belgium
and Serbia, Asks Terms From Teuton Enemy, and
Makes Complete Surrender of His Country
(Dy United Press Leased Wire.)
Merlin, Jan. 17. Making the first
break In the ranks of the allies,
Montenegro has asked her enemy,
Austria, for peace.
Crushed and broken, and threat
ened by complete destruction before
the hordes or Austriaus overrunning
her, the country has surrendered
completely.
Announcement ot Montenegro's re
quest for peaco came today from
Count Tlsza, before tho Hungarian
parliament.
"Parliament had Just finished the
first order of business when Count
TiBza asked permission to Interrupt,"
said tho dlapatch detailing the peace
news. "Ho Informed parliament that
the Montenegrin king and parliament
had asked for Inauguration ot peace
negotiations."
Tisza said that Austria demanded
thnt Montenegro lay down her arms
unconditionally, and that King
Nicholas had acceded to this pro
posal. Negotiations, he added, will
begin Immediately.
Parliament burst forth In a Joyous
demonstration at the tidings, and the
rejoicing was reflected In Ituda Pest
and Vienna and Berlin.
It Is understood that King Nlcholns
has gono to Italy and probably an
Austrian will sit on tho throne that
he quit when the stress ot war be
camo too serious for him longer
to hold out.
Tho peace proposals did not come
as n surprise, for several days ago It
was reported unofficially that Monte
negro had asked for an armistice. At
that tlmo Austrlans had swept vic

Snlonikl, Dec. 11. For nine days
I have 'been watching the Salonlkl re
treat of the allies.
From tho front trenches, back to
tho harbor ot Salonlkl, a strip ot
land sixty miles wide. I have seen
tho thousands of demonstrations and
tokens of retirement.
I have talked to General Sarrall,
leader of the allied forces here, and
to General Balllaud, In the field; to
majors, captains and privates ot both
the French and British forces, and
they have, more or less, admitted
that a retreat Is under way. But one
man whom I believe more than all
tho war departments and chancel
leries ot Europe Is tho man, who with
his family and his few household
goods, loaded on a little, rattling
wagon, hauled by steors, Is coming
to Salonlkl today. He is hore for the
first time; ho Is here In hundreds;
In all the phantasmagoria of wagons,
horses, steers, motor buses and lim
ousines, which fill tho foggy water
front streets ot Salonlkl today. He
lends a naw and Bombro color to the
brown of tho Greek, the grey of the
Fronch and tho khnkl of tho British
and tho green of the Serbian soldiers.
He has done little talking. His very
presence hero with his dejected fam
ily and his pitiful little possessions
speak louder than anything ho could
say. lie Is a refugee from Serbia.
Not from northern Serbia, where the
Germans and Austrlans have ibeen
sweeping Sorlbla clean, but from the
Serbian soil that 'borders on Greece
only twenty miles from here.
The Germans and Austrlans have
not driven him out from his home;
1
toriously Into Cettlnje, capital of the
kingdom. Subsequent engagements
are believed to have "been fought be
tween Austrlans and Montenegrin Ir
regulars. Montenegro declared war on Aus
tria August 7, 1914, and on Germany
August 12. Peace terms will include
both countries. At the outset Monte
negrins Invaded Bosnia and Herze
govina. They co-operated, too, with
the Serbians. Despite the fact that
the Montenegrins were poorly equip
ped and unable to make much pro
gress, they held the small portion ot
Invaded Austrian territory until re
cently. All the time their fighting
was with the ferocity ot fantatlcism.
Compared with the forces hurled
against them at various times, the
Montenegrins were scarcely more
than a handful, and it Is reported
that at no time did they have an
army of more than 50,000.
The crisis In Montenegro came with
the culmination of the Teutonic cam
paign against Serbia. Austrian forces
turned their attention to an invasion
of the little country and within the
past few weeks had swept victorious
ly over the entire country and Into
the capital, Cettlnje, after surmount
ing tho supposedly impregnable diffi
culty Mount Lowcen, key to Cet
tlnje. With this occupation, Montenegro
found herself facing extermination,
so decided not to continue the
struggle. She was able to ask the
peace Inasmuch as she had not sign
ed the allied treaty binding England,
France, Russia and Italy, not to con
clude a separate peace.
IT TELLS IF RETREAT
ARMY IN SALIKA
It is the work ot tho Bulgarians. The
patter of his oxen's feet and the
creak ot the rough wheels ot his
wagon say louder than any nice
words ot generals that the Bulgars
are driving tho allies back toward
Salonlkl. You can always believe
htm, this man with his family, travel
ing out In the cold and tho mud,
with the worried face and the per
plexed soul ho does not leave his
home and his farm until he must;
until the "guns are "booming and the
shells are plowing his farm for him.
When "he" goes, you may be sure
the enemy Is coming on behind him
and that the army of his country Is
in retreat. I have Been him in Ga
llclu, France, Italy, Serbia, Greece.
He haB never lied. His presence al
ways means "retreat." Being a Ser
bian, his, Christmas will come on
January 7. Small chance Santa Claus
will have to get down the chimney of
this man's home this year.
On the outskirts of Salonlkl this
afternoon men ore erecting tents In
a muddy field tor the Serbian ref
ugees and their families. Within the
past six weeks nearly half a million
dollars ot American and British
money has been sent here for Bitch an
emergency and today, for the first
time, tho money Is being put to use.
Tho harbor of Salonlkl Is almost
empty of .'boats, though usually It is
full. For several days forty-six trans
ports, loaded with troops who had
newly come to Salonlkl, and who had
not disembarked, lay In the harbor.
Now they have gone, troops and all.
No one In Salonlkl knows whore.
People are speculating albout the pos-

TO THE BRITISH
Stockholm, Jan. 17. In a speech
from the throne at the opening ot
parliament today, King Gustav de
livered what many regarded as a
warning to England against further
acts against Swedish commerce.
The king called attention to the
alleged "usurpation of power" (by the
belligerents. While be did not detail
any ot these usurpations, the remark
was regarded as significant in view of
renorts that England Is about to
blockade Germany and cut oft the
trade between Germany and Sweden.
"Belligerents," he said, "have neg
lected in an ever-increasing degree in
ternational laws or the protection ot
neutrals and limiting violence In war.
Sweden more than once has been ob
liged to Intervene against the at
tempts to put her Idustrial and com
cerclal life under the usurped control
of an other power.
His announcement was greeted
with cheers.

ness for war through having efficient
men, with good living and working
conditions, will be emphasized be
fore the biennial convention ot the
United Mine workers of America,
opening here tomorrow. It will he
pointed out that a nation of under
paid workers is not a strong nation.
Citing the case of England, it will
be contended that her prosecution of
the war has been hampered by dis
satisfied workers. President White
will urge that the United States must,
have satisfied workers if it hopes to
be prepared.
With industrial preparedness as
the keynote, he will declare for a
policy of higher wages after April 1,
when wage contracts expire In union
fields in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.

threatened to lift bungalows from
their foundations, and squads of po
lice rushed to rescue the inmates.
Broad streets became ibrawling rivers,
littered with floating debris. Outfall
sewers were choked and huge lakes
formed at Intersections, covering the
sidewalks. Many local car lines were
tied up.
The low lands between Venice and
Sawtelle were entirely inundated.

will soon appoint a commission to In

atrocities charges. This is the first
result of Cardinal 'Mercier's represen

churchmen favor It, provided it Is

nations that the charges of German
cruelty and outrages are baseless.

charges, Including alleged attacks up-
