COMMITTEE IS WORKING FOR A
CELEBRATION OF "BOBBIE
BURNS" DAY
Through the efforts ot many of To
nopah's representative citizens a Cal
edonian club is in the making. There
are a number of Scotchmen and de
scendents of Scotch in this vicinity
and as they are beyond the question
of a doubt, all good, hard working,
faithful men, prompt to act and wide
awake, there Is no reason that such
a club will not be a success.
The first event planned by these
Scotchmen Is a Bums' day. Too
much praise cannot be given them tor
such an undertaking. Burns, the man
who has brought us so close to na
ture, the man who saw beauty in a
daisy, Borrow in the fact that a field
mouse should be disturbed, etc., de
serves a day of celebration, not only
by the Scotch, but by every human
being as well.
Thomas Lindsay was chosen chair
man of the committee and with the
help of the rest of Tonopah's Scotch
men a splendid program Is promised
in memory of our beloved "Bobby
Burns."
