of securing protection for American
'life and property tii Mexico, revived
by the Santa Ysabel murders la ex
pected by--congressional leaders to be
a dominant subject in thepirxse^dlngs
of both houses during the coming
week. Issues arising from the. Euro
pean war have been completely over

and other Important legislative meas
ures under consideration are hot
drawing the attention that would or
dinarily be given them.

of sending troops with the party.
Advices further stated that the Car

Watson a personal passport and i"*
Carranza immigration authorities In

Fully One-third of Thriving
City of Bergen, Norway,
is Destroyed.
BUSINESS PART
LEFT IN RUINS
Blaze Started on Saturday
Night and Was Fanned
by Strong Wind.
Christiania, Norway, Jan. 17.—A
third of the city of Bergen, a thriving
Norwegian seaport with a population
of 90,000, was destroyed Saturday
night by fire.
Two lives are reported to have been
lost and 2,000 persons are homeless.
The property damage is estimated at
$16,000,000.
Worst in Country.
The conflagration Is said to be the
worst ever recorded in Norway. The
business section, with its old whole
sale houses, several of the largest of
the hotels, a number of schools, the
electric plant and banks and news
paper buildings, was the part burned:
The difficulties of the 2,000 persons
now without homes were increased by
the fact that the largest storage
houses, filled with provisions for sup
I plying the surrounding country, were
burned down. It is harder to obtain
groceries today than at any time since
the outbreak of the war.
Bergen never was so flourishing as
at the beginning of the present year,
these conditions being due largely to
the Increased merchant marine.
Started Saturday.
The fire started Saturday evening in
an iron monger's shop and fanned by
a hurricane the flames spread rapidly
and soon enveloped all the business
portion of the city.
All the largest buildings including
hotels, newspaper offices and telegraph
and telephone exchanges, were de
stroyed. The telgraph officials work
ed bravely in sending messages until
their last lines were broken.
The firemen endeavored to circum
scribe the area of the fight but their
task was hopeless. In order to pre
vent a further spread of the conflagra
tion they finally blew up buildings on
the outer edge of the path of the
flames. Late reports say that no lives
were lost.
Bergen is one of the oldest and most
picturesque towns in Norway, and Jt
ranks: first of the Norwegian ship
owning centers. It is well built on a
hilly peninsula and is situated at the
end of a deep bay of the Atlantic 190
miles northwest of Christiania.
Bergen passes a large part of the for
eign trade of Norway. Fleets of ves
sels bring the produce of the northern
fisheries to the seaport.
Suffered Repeatedly.
Bergen has repeatedly suffered from
fire as in 1702 and 1856 and the
broad open spaces which interrupt
the streets are Intended as a safe
guard against the spread of flames.
Many of the houses still are timber
built and painted white.

at any time, according to Lee.
"'At the hearing I am going to prove
that Irving is not sane," said Lee. "I
do not think that he is mentally well
balanced, he has had too much time
to think. He doesn't work, and as a.
result he has been using his mental
faculty too much and his muscles to
little."
Furman D. Updike, according to po
lice, retired from business some time
ago, but still holds stock In the Up
