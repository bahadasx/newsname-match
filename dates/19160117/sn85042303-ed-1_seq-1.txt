A destructive fire started this mort.
ing at 11:30 at Wirt, the town In tlu
Healillon oil fields. The chief oper
ator at Wirt wired the chief operator
; here at that hour, stating that the
telephone office was on fire and that
a hasty retreat from the building had
i to be made. Inasmuch as the tele
phone office was burned, It was im-
. possible to pet a report from there.
Both sides of the street was burning,
nnd the smoke could be seen from
. here, a distance of twenty-seven
miles. It is believed here that al
! most the entire business section is
wiped out. How the fire started could
not be learned.
G. D. Payne of the Frlck-Reid peo
ple, said he had heard of the fire,
and believed that his supply store
' would be safe, as no buildings were

night.
The chances are that the stores of
iZan Williams and John Whiteman, the

burned.

The fuel oil department of the
Santa Fe received the most intelll

private line. According to that re
port, the fire started in the Oil Ex

nnd destroyed Zan 'Williams' store,
the postofflce, nnd John Whlteman's
store. Budd Hoard's store and all
the buildings on the south side of tha
street were swept away. It is prob

Attacking the Turks.
London, Jan. 17. The Turks are
now being attacked by both Russians
and 'British. In the Caucasus the
Russians, greatly reinforced, are on
the offensive along a front of almost
j a hundred miles, while In Mesopot
I nmia the British have forced the re
tirement of the Ottoman troops
along both banks of the Tigris river
to the south of Kut-Fl-Amara, and
still are closely pressing them on
the east and the north.
Constantinople reports that near
Karadach the Russians were defeated
with heavy casualties, while Petro
grad asserts that at some unnamed
place a large number of Turkish of
ficers and men, war materials and
provisions, eight guns nnd eight ma
chine guns, were captured by the
Russians. Successes for the Russians
in the fighting in Persia also are
claimed by Petrograd. In its of
ficial report, Petrograd makes the
first announcement that the Ger
mans are fighting with the Turks in
this region.
The Turks in retreat along the Ti
gris are those who have held back
General Aylmer's column proceeding
up the river to the relief of the Brit
ish In Kut-EI-Amara.
On the other fronts, except In Mon
tenegro, little fighting is ln progress.
The offensive of the Russians in
east Galicia and along the Bessara
bian front has again died down. On
the line in France and Belgium the
operations have consisted mainly of
artillery duels and mining" and coun
ter mining work. The big British
guns have thrown shells Into Lille
but Berlin says only slight damage
was done.

Parians from the Italians near the
