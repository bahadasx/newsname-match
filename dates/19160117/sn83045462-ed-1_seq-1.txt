Any Plan for Defense Which

Spirit.
Another strong plea for increased
military preparedness for
the United -States, with the backing
of a great and powerful organization
representing capital.
labor and the public of the counm.
was made today at the opening
session of a two-dav convention
of the National Civic Federation
at the New \\ illard Hotel.
The plea was voiced by Seth
Low. president of the organiza- i
tion. who is the former mayor of j
New York and the former head of j
Columbia University, in the pres-;
ence of a distinguished gathering
of some of the most prominent!
men and women of the country,
the latter being present to participate
in what was a joint session
of the main body of the federation
and the woman's depart-,
mcnt of the organization. Samuel
Compers, president of the Ameri- ;
ran Federation of Labor, vice j
president of the federation, pre-;
sided.
Wherein Lies Nation's Safety.
Mr. Low was cheered to the echo by
ail elements when he said:
"If the United States is to prevent
the antagonisms and hates of Europe
and its age-long traditions of empire
from flrtding lodgment on this continent
after the war, it must be bv the
strength of our own right arm and by
the willingness to die for what is certainly
precious to ourselves and for
what we believe to be no less precious
to humanity."
Today's sessions of the convention,
which took place at 10 a.m. and 3:30
p.m.. were not intended to be devoted j
to the subject of military preparedness.
That will come up in a special session i
of the organization tomorrow' morning,
but the subject of afrlequate defenses
for the United States "Is largely engaging
the attention of the members, and
the woman's department intends to
play a very large part in the discussion
of this public question, having organized
what is called "The Woman's
Section of the Movement for National
Preparedness." The latter organizaVon.
which is amalgamated with the
entire woman's section of the federation.
is composed of the same prominent
women who so efficiently handled

BERLIN, January 17, by wireless
to Sayville.?After delaying
for a week the advance of strong
Russian forces in the Caucasus,
the Turks have withdrawn their j
advanced posts several miles at j
some points, according to the
Turkish official stateiiTfnt of today,
received here from Constantinople.
Turks Admit Retirement.
"In the Caucasus the Russians repeated
their attacks acainst Turkish positions
on both banks of the Arasa, suf
fering heavy losses, especially in the
district between the Arasa and the Inid
valley. Here Turkish advanced posts
retired some kilometers, after having
delayed strong enemy forces for one
week."
Regarding operations in Mesopotamia
the statement says:
"There has been intermittent artillery
fire near Kut-el-Amara."
Defeated in Mesopotamia.
LONDON, January 17, 3:23 p.m.?Announcement
was made in the house of
commons today that the Turkish forces
in Mesopotamia have fallen back to
within six miles of Kut-el-Amara.
The announcement was made by J.
Austen Chamberlain, secretary for India.
who said the Turks had retreated
as the result of another British victory.

Approved by War Council.
The recent operations in Mesopotamia,
including the advance to Ctesiphon,
were considered and approved by
the war council, said Mr. Chamberlain.
"It would not be in the public interest
that I should make any statement
on the scope of the operations
now in progress. Information of that
kind in the present circumstances
would be far more valuable to the enemy
than to the house.
"On the 11th instant, I announced to
the house that the enemy had retired
to Essian. a position six miles east of
Kut-el-Amara. He. however, apparently
advanced again on the 12th
to what is called in the telegram the
Waddi position. Since then we have
received telegrams from Gen. Townshend
up to the morning of the Jf>th,
and from these telegrams it appears
that Gen. Aylmer was pressing back
two divisions on the left bank at and
about the Waddi position.
Fighting Is Continuous.
' There was continuous fighting on the
13th in the neighborhood, and on the
morning of the 14th Gen. Aylmer reported
that the enemy was again retiring
and that he himself was moving
his headquarters arid his water transport
to the mouths of the Waddi. On
the l.',th Gen. Aylmer reported that the
whole of the Waddi Position had been
captured and the enemy rear guard
had taken tip a position at Essian.
"Gen. Aylmer reports that the operations
were seriously hampered throughout
by the weather, and I am sorry to
say that the weather is reported to be
had All the wounded have been sent
down the river.''
Pressing the Turks Hard.
This is the second defeat for the Turks
in Mesopotamia in the last few days, as
given in British official reports. It was
announced in London yesterday that the
Turks had been beaten at Orah, on the
Tigris, twentv-flve miles below Kut-elAmara,
and were in retreat.
The attack is being made by the army
of Gen. Aylmer. which is advancing in
an attempt to form a junction with the
original British expedition under Gen.
Townshend. which is now at Kut-elAii.ata.
This army retired to that point
I ?ecember having been defeated in an
advance on Bagdad after getting within
less than twenty miles of the city, it is
now surrounded and hard pressed by the

of malted milk. He plans to increase
his food gradually, fearing that if he
suddenly began eating regular meals
again after his long abstinence from
food <ne old trouble from which he suffered
and on account of which he undertook
to fast might return. Mr.
Adams took no food whatever during
the thirty days, but every morning
drank a large glass of hot water.
Mr. Adams said today that he was
feeling fine, atid he looked it. He lost
some ten pounds or more weight on account
of his abstinence from food, he
says, but expects to regain this weight
soon.
A remarkable feature of Mr. Adams'
fast was that it did not prevent him

FOR STANDARDIZING
PUBLIC BUILDINGS
Representative Clark Urges
Adoption of Omnibus Bill
This Session.
SUPERVISING ARCHITECT'S
METHODS ARE ATTACKED
Office Is Five Years Behind in Its
Work, He Tells the House of
Representatives.
An attack on the office of the
supervising architect of the
Treasury and the general manner
of treating the question of
public buildings by the executive
departments was made in the
House today,when Representative
Clark of Florida, chairman of the
public buildings and grounds
committee, delivered a speech in
favor of an omnibus building bill
this session. Representative
Clark also denied vigorously that
the committee is a pork barrel
affair, and challenged any one to
prove to the contrary. Wasteful
ness in public building bills be
laid at the door of republican
committees, and recommended
that a standardized type of buildings
be used all over tbe country
so as to help tbe supervising architect
to catch up to his work.
Mr. Clark's Address.
Representative Clark said, in part:
"Congress in every item of every general
public building bill has left the
cost in the discretion of the Treasury
Department. We have never enacted j
that a specific sum of money should be j
expended in the construction of a government
building in a particular case,
but in each and every case we have fixed
the maximum of cost beyond which
the Treasury Department could not go.
For instance, where we provided for a
building at a given place with an authorization
of $100,000 we have always
fl va/4 tViit amnunf a a tho
'limit of cost,' and if In such case the p
department in its discretion felt that
a fifty-thousand-dollar building would j
answer the purpose there has never !
been anything to hinder the construe- '
tion of s cheaper building. Tf, there- |
fore, magnificent, monumental build- I
ings have been constructed in one- !
horse crossroads towns, where the bus- j
iness of the government did not de- j
mand it. and thereby the money of the
people has been needlessly wasted, the I
fault lies at the door of the Treasury
Department and is not chargeable to
us."
He continued:
"The office of the supervising architect
of the Treasury Department is
about five years behind in its work, arid
there is not the slightest prospect under
existing methods of ever catching
up. There Jire, to my mind, two reasons
why that bureau or branch of the service
is so far behind. One reason is the j
fact that some years ago the then !
Secretary of the Treasury, without au- !
thority of law, issued orders to his
subordinates tha tthey were to construct
in one year only 25 per cent ofj
the buildings provided for in a gen- ?
eral public building bill but recently
passed. Thus it will be seen that with !
one stroke of the pen and in utter con- j
tempt for the will of Congress these j
buildings were thrown three years behind.
"Nullify Acts of Congress."
"T want to nay right here that this
practice of executive departments issuing
orders which practically have the
effect of nullifying acts of Congress has
grown to sucli proportions and has
been so long and persistently practiced
that the departmental veto has coine
to be recognized as a legitimate gov- {
ernmental function. Congress is no j
longer the supreme power in matters of I
legislation. We, the chosen representatives
of the people, selected by popular
vote every two years, charged with
the duty of writing inlo the law of the
land the will of the sovereign citizenship
of the republic, sit supinely by
while mere appointees of the executive
set aside and declare null and void our
most solemn enactments. We havrfe.
tamely submitted to executive encroachment
for so long; we have for

the government. It is neither in
interest of economy nor is it in th

THINK DISASTER DUE
TO NATURALCAUSES
Officials Inquiring Into E-2
Explosion Reported to Have
Reached Conclusion.
NO CREDENCE IN RUMOR
OF OUTSIDE AGENCIES
Edison's Engineer Confident Batteries
Were Not Besponsible?Secretary
Daniels' New Rule.
NEW YORK. January 17.?Officials
conducting: the two inquiries?civil and
naval?into the cause of the internal
explosion Saturday on the submarine
E-2 at the New York navy yard, which
caused the death of four men and serious
injuries to ten others, were convinced
today, it was learned at the
yard, that the accident was due entirely
to natural causes. They were giving:
no consideration to the suggestion
that outside agencies might have been
responsible, it was said.
Three Men in Critical Condition.
Three of the six enlisted men who
were injured were still in a critical
condition today at the Naval Hospital.
The four civilians in a city hospital
were sufficiently recovered to be questioned
by Coroner Wagner. Three of
them told the coroner they were suffering
from colds last Saturday, and
were therefore unable to detect the
possible presence of gas within the hull.
The fourth man. however, said that he
smelled only the usual odor of gas and
oil previous to the explosion.
Statement by Reese Hutchinson.
A statement, declaring that the new
Edison storage battery could not in
any way have been responsible for
the explosion has been made by Miller
Reese Hutchinson, chief engineer
for Thomas A. Edison, and a member of
the naval consulting board.
The statement also says:
"As to the Edison battery, with all
the facts and conditions before me, I see
no reason to recommend to Mr. Edison
- any changes or alterations in the
theory, construction or method of installation
of the Edison submarinetype
storage battery. The battery in
the E-2 does not appear to have been
injured in the least."
The preliminary inquiry into the explosion
was held in secret yesterday
by the board ot inquiry appointed by
? Hear Admiral Nathaniel R. Usher, com1
mandant of the navy yard. Neither Ad?
miral Usher nor any of those present
? would discuss what occurred at the inquiry.
F'ersons on board or near the
J E-2 at the time of the explosion were
v questioned at length, however.
J Rear Admiral Usher made the follow*
ing formal statement last night:
"The board of inquiry met today and
went aboard the submarine, where they
" conducted a thorough investigation.
The investigation was not finished and
therefore the board will again meet tomorrow.
No conclusion was reached."
More Thorough Inspection Ordered.
| Batteries, engines and other vital
' parts of submarines hereafter will be
tested more thoroughly in laboratories
before they are placed aboard the un"
derwater boats. That policy, announced
by Secretary of Navy Daniels
today, will be inaugurated with a view
of preventing, as far as is possible, the
recurrence of such an explosion as that
which destroyed the submarine E-2, in
* the New York navy yard .Saturday.
* "The battery of the E-2," Mr. Daniels
. said, "was placed aboard the vessel as
an experiment, there being at the time
' no other way in which it could be test
ed. The vessel was prepared especially
r for that purpose.
"I have asked an initial appropriation
of $1,000,000 for the erection of a
naval laboratory where batteries, en;
gines and other mechanical parts of
j the navy's ships may be tested and experiments
conducted to assure their
1 safety. This ought to be done before
> they are installed on the boats, and ,
, what resources the navy now has will
be used for that purpose."
Report From Board Not In.
I The board of investigation in session :
at the New York yard examining the E-2
had not reported to the Navy Depart- <
merit toaay, ana no niriiier information
ronceming the explosion had
reached officials here. Rear Admiral
t'sher, commandant of the yard, how- j
ever, is expected to send a preliminary
survey of the findings to Secretary
Daniels- either today or tomorrow.
It was announced that Secretary
> Daniels would designate a board of
, inquiry composed of naval experts to
make a searching examination of the
wrecked vessel and ascertain, if possi*
ble, the cause of the explosion, which
. so far-is unknown to officials here. The
board will be composed of officers
especially familiar with submarine
construction and equipment, and their
appointment will be announced as

the selection.

TREATY WITH CARRANZA
Oklahoman Says Action Is Necessary
Unless Disorders South of Bio

OPPOSITION TO INTERVENTION
Mr. Thomas Tells Senate Wholo
Trouble Is Due to Commercial
Rivalry of Foreign Concerns
That Are Backing
Agitation.
Establishment of a neutral zone
in northern Mexico, to be jointly
policed by the governments of
Mexico and the United States unless
Mexican disorder is speedily
controlled, is proposed in a resolution
introduced today by Sena
tor Gore, democrat, ot Ukianoma.
The resolution, referred to the
foreign relations committee,
would authorize the President of
the United States to enter into
an agreement with Gen. Carrauza
as first chief of the de facto government
of Mexico, under which
order would be restored and life
rendered secure in that portion of
the republic adjacent to the
United States. There was no discussion
of the resolution in the
Senate.
Opposes Intervention Now.
Senator Thomas of Colorado said today,
concerning the Mexican situation:
"I do not believe in armed intervention
in Mexican affairs so long as it
can be avoided consistently with the
nation's duty to itself and its obligations
as the exponent of the Monroe
doctrine. The soundness of this view
seems to me self-evident. There are,
however, specific reasons to sustain it.
The first and most important is that,
intervention involves the permanent,
occupation of the country. I make this
assertion from my knowledge of the
Mexican character and the Mexican
country.
"The duty which we assumed when
we intervened for the Filipinos is a
modest one compared with that arising
from Mexican intervention.
"A second reason is the right of the
Mexican people to settle their own
troubles in their own way. As Senator
Williams aptly put it. 'They have a
right to govern themselves, and that
right of self-government involves the
right of self-misgovernment.' Merely
because the latter prevails we have no
right of interference. Moreover, a war
with Mexico, for that is what intervention
means, would not only revive
but intensify the racial and political
antagonisms with the l^atin peoples to
the south of the I'nited States, now
happily disappearing, due in large part
to our policy regarding Mexico.
The Real Beneficiaries.
"Last., but by no means least, is the
fact that the commercial rivals, largely
responsible for Mexico'? unhappy condition.
have, in my opinion, been strong for
intervention for years. And these will be
the principal beneficiaries of a war the
cost of which in the expenditure of blood
and treasure will bo enormous.
"Mexican intervention when it does occur
will be nc holiday affair. A country
containing 15.00ti.000 population inured
to wa~ by the e\t>erien?-e of six bloody
years ann compiling n*.?.?w s-MU?imiles
of diversified territory, including a
enormous stretch of seaboard, can neither
he conquered nor pacified without Ion
rind strenuous effort.
"Of course, these considerations should
not deter us from taking: action when to
jo so becomes imperative The concrete
situation is critical because of the tragedy
jf last Wednesday, the horror of which
lias naturally stirred the blood and
iroused the indignation of the people f
sympathize with and in some degree share
in the impulse to move 011 Mexico at
?nce. But it is obvious that the mbnirut
5f passion is not one for wise or intelligent
action. We must remember that
Italy, Japan and China have been sinrarly
stirred by occurrences in America,
and very sensibly reflected that they
ould not justify war. It is true that
Mexico does t or enjoy a stable govcrnnent.
But it has a government, noverheless.
whose head should l>c required
*nd then given op|>ortunity to punish the
rturderers and make reparation.
"When Carranzu fails or becomes untble
to do this intervention may be
tecessary. We can and must give him
his opportunity or establish a precedent
vhich may return to plague us in the
tear future."
