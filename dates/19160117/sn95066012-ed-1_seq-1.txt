Three of Ten Injured at Kew York
May Die
CAUSE NOr YET DETERMINED
Three of Victims Civilians Who Were
Repairing Vessel Hydiozen Prob
ably Responsible.
New York, Jan. 16. V statement
indicating that the new Edison stor
age battery was not in anv way re
sponsible for the explosion on the
submarine K-2 at the New York navy
yard yesterday was made tonight by
.Miller Heese Hutchinson, chief engi
neer for Thomas A. Edison and a
member of the naval consultiu.t;
board.
The preliminary inquiry into the
explosion took place in secret today
by the board of inquiry appointed by
Hear Admiral Nathaniel K. Usher,
commandant of the navy yard. Neith
er Admiral Usher nor any of those
present would discuss what tran
spired. Persons on board or near the
E-2 at the time of the explosion were
questioned at length.
Four men were killed and 10 oth
ers injured, five of them tlanscrously,
in an explosion which occurred yes
tetday afternoon on the submarine
E-2 while the craft was undergoing
repairs in drydock at (he New York
navy-yard. One of the men killed
was an enlisted electrician and the
other three civiliah workers. At
least three! of the .10 now in hospi
tals arc not expected to live. The
dead:
Koy H. Scalier, electrician, sec
ond class, of Cleveland. O.
. James 11. Feck. .tfvlUrfri' ge'ni'ia!
helper, cf Brooklyn.
J. P. Schultz, civilian, machinist, of
Ltrooklyn.
Joseph Loi,an. civilian, geuer.i!

moto. Mr.; James Lyons, civilian;
Henry Zoll, civilian; Otto
civilian; Hichard lleyne,
Michael Peyser, civilian;
Maseti,
civilian :
August
Knpin, civilian.
Although the detonation was ter
rilic, the submarine itself, from the
outside, shows none of the effects of
the explosion, the second fatal acci
dent of its kind in the history of the
United States navy. The interior
apparatus was shattered, but so
tight was the shell that there was
no means of escape for gas which
accumulated and ,it was more than
an, hour after the blast before the
work of recovering the bodies could
be completed. A ladder was blown
up through the conning tower and
fell lot) feet away. The Injured men
and one body were removed soon
alter the accident, but three bodies,
far down in the craft, could not be
reached until the gas had been, blown
out by com tressed air. Soon after
the explosion several naval officers'
led a rescue parly into the drydock.,
but were partly overcome by bus
fumes when they attempted to de
scend into the vessel. It was then
that compressed air pipes were run
into the shell and the pas forced out.
The number of men inside the sub
marine at the time of the explosion
is not definitely known. About 20
were working on the craft, but all of
them were not on tbe boat at the
same time. It Is believed that nobody
who was inside could have escaped
injury. What caused the explosion
lias not been definitely decided.
Hear Admiral Usher made the . fol
lowing formal statement tonight:'. .
"The board of inquiry met today
and went aboard the submarine,
where they conducted a thorough in
vestigation. The investigation was
not finished, and therefore the board
will meet again tomorrow. No con
clusion was reached."
Secretary of the Navy Josephus
Daniels, who is expected to name to
morrow a board of inquiry to conduct
a formal investigation, left for Wash
ington this afternoon, 'without making
any statement regarding the explos
ion. At the navy yard, inquirers were,
turned away with the statement that
Bear Admiral Usher and the
others

to say."

BERGEN IN RUINS
Norway Seaport Suffers $15,000,000
Fire.
Christiania, Norway, via London,
Jan. 1G. A third of the city of Ber
gen, a thriving Norwegian seaport
with a population of 90,000 was de
stroyed last night by lire.
Two lives are reported to have
been lost and 2,000 persons are home
less. The property damage is esti
mated at $15,000,011(1.
The conflagration is said to nave
been the worst ever recorded in Nor
way. The business district with 'is
old 'wholesale houses, several of the
largest of the hotels, many schools,
the electric plant, and banks and
newspaper buildings was the pari
burned.
The difficulties of the 2,0i)0 persons
now without hemes were increased by
the fact that the largest storage
houses, filled with provisions for sup
plying the surrounding country were
burned, it is harder to obtain groc
eries todsiy than at any time si'ice
the outbreak of the war.
Bergen never was so flourishing as
at t lie beginning of the present yea ',
these conditions being due largely to
the increased merchant marine.

RAY COLLINS QUITS
Boston Red Sox Pitcher Now Out of
' Base Ball.
Rutland. Jan. lt. Ray W. Collins
of Colchester, for the la3t six years
a first string pitcher of the Boston
Red Sox, will never again don a uni
form for Boston or any other club.
He made that positive declaration
here this afternoon. He said that
this decision was final and although
he has net yet decided on just what
he will do in the future, he Intimated
that he would devote his entire time
to the management ot his property in
Colchester, 'which Includes a valuable
farm.
Collins would not say just what con
sideration led him to this decision,
but he declared that no specific dis
satisfaction with his berth with the
Boston tendered a contract for 1916
by President Lannin and that the
terms named therein were satisfac
tory. The big southpaw returned to his
home tonight after having been for
three days in attendance at the ses
sions of the boys' conference, in
which he is greatly interested.
It has been reported from Boston
that Collins was among the several
high salaried Red Sox players who ,
would have to stand for a sizeable re- i
ductlon in salary this year in line
with a general policy of retrerchment
following the conclusion of the war
between tho Federal League and or
ganized baseball and that the Yer
monter did not relish a reduction of
wagcL.
The former University of Vermont
man had the poorest year ot his ca
reer1 last season and rumors have
been rife that Manager Carrigan in
tended to trade him to some other
club, believing that he had outlived
his usefulness in the Hub. Some of
his local friends believe that Collins
decision to retire is the result of de
termination to forestall any attempt
by Carrigan to railroad him into
some other less congenial American
League berth or into the minors.

STUBBORN NIGHT
ESTIMATED AT
HIGH SC
Believe Blaze Caused By Light Wires
Loss Not Yet Accurately Determined But Is Fully
Covered By Insurance High School To
Be Held In School St. Building
Excellent Work By Firemen
The new high school building was
badly damaged by Are Sunday night.
I That the district has any high school
building left today is due to the .splen
did construction of the building and
the magnificent struggle put up by the
fire department.
The fire was discovered and an
alarm rung in from Box 1C at 8.30 o'
clock and for three hours the firemen
fought valiantly against a blaze that
worked around In partitions and un
der the roof where it was just
about impossible to get at it. The re
lease was sounded about 12.30, but
Chief Harry B. Spear and several
firemen remained on guard. At 5 o'
clock this morning tho blaze started
up again and another alarm was
pulled in, but the fire boys soon had
it under control.
The fire apparently started from
the electric wires in the wall back of
the laboratory and presumably had

Bennington's New High School Building Erected In 1913 at a Cost of
$S5,0C0 and in Use Since Nov. 1st, 1914. Damaged by Fire Last
Evening With Estimated Loss of $25,000 Covered by Insurance
been smouldering for hours, creeping
along the wall and up Into the attic
and finally breaking out around, the
ventilation shafts. Had the building
been of ordinary construction it
would have spread so rapidly that the
building could not have been saved,
but the wire lath and cement walls
held it from spreading until the fire
men could dig through the -walls and I
drown it out.
It was at first thought that the flra
might have started from the chemi
cals in the laboratory closet, but
when access was gained to this closet
the chemicals were found undamaged.
Tho wires seem to have been th-3 j
only thing inside the partition that
could possibly have started the f.ra
This wiring had been Inspected and
approved by a representative .of the
New England Underwriters associa
tion so it was not open to suspicion.
The loss has not as yet been esti
mated by anybody whose opinion is
entitled to any great consideration,
but is guessed by local citizens with
out technical knowledge all ihc -way
from $20,000 to $30,000.
A large proportion of tho loss Is due
to water. Hundreds of tons of wate.
were poured into the building for
hours. The smoke was so dense that
It was dangerous for the firemen,
who repeatedly risked their lives ia
efforts to get at the fire. When the
ceiling fell in Miss Hoffman's room,
two firemen narrowly escaped being
crushed under the blazing debris.
The wind was strong during tho
fire, but the firemen by keeping doors
and windows' mostly closed in spile
of tho smoke kept tho wind from
driving tho fire into tho north end of
tbe building.
All the ceilings, walls and floors ri
the south part of the building arc

a part of this furniture is being trans
ferred this' afternoon to the graded
school building and high, school
classes will be resumed there tomor

offer will be accepted for the teacher
training class. Rev. T. F. Turner has

dried out. Desks aud furniture are
being wiped and placed in dry places.

desk drawers, are not much damaged.
A big crowd turned out at the first
alarm, but most cf them thought the
fire was under control and went
home before tho werst stage of the
blaze which was about 10.30. Several
ot the school trustees, Supt. Varney,
Principal Mabrey and Janitor Lilster
worked with the firemen, and veternn
ex-fircmen greatly aided tho active
members of tho department
The building was erected during
the year 1914 find the building was
opened for r.chool purposes Nov. 1
that year.
George Harwood retired from the
fire department a few days ago after
over 50 years Service, but when tho
steamer call camo he responded with
tho alacrity of a boy and took charge
of tho steamer.
The fire walls, fire stopping bases"
and tho wire lath proved their worth
delaying the spread of the fire.
Chief Spear and assistants Sear.3
and Brings and the members of all
the companies and the ex-members,
who aided them, deserve the thanks
ot the community.
