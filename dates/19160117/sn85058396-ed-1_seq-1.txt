MASSACRE STORY I
OFFICIALLY TOLD I
State Department Gives Out- '
line of Evidence of Mexican
Outrage Obtained in H
El Paso.
PARTY HAD NO ESCORT H
Chihuahua Authorities Told M
Americans No Guard Was
Necessary Watson Car- M
ried General Passport. M
Washington, Jan. 17. Evidence
collected at El Paso by state depart- H
ment agents indicates that Carranza
authorities at Chihuahua assured C. 1
R. Watson, head of the party of Amer- H
leans killed near Santa Ysabel, that H
no escort was necessary. In that opln- H
Ion, however, many of the Americans H
agreed, although they had suggested H
to the authorities the advisability of H
sending troops with the party. H
The state department gave out this H
paraphrase of its official advices from H
El Paso: 1
Party Felt Safe.
Holmes, tho only survivor of the H
massacre, has no knowledge as to H
whether Watson and his companions H
requested a military escort or guard H
for their trip from Chihuahua to Cusi- H
huirachlc. He states that if they did H
so the authorities declined to furnish M
an escort or guard. Holmes says that H
all the members of the party felt safe M
in making the trip. M
'It Is reported by a person connect- M
ed with one of the companies operat- M
ing In Chihuahua that on the day that M
the American party started for the 1
works he had a conversation with H
Watson and asked him if a Mexican H
escort was to accompany his party . H
Watson replied that such, an escort H
would not go with them as he had M
talked with the authorities and they M
told him It was not necessary." J
As to what assurances, if any, Wat M
sou and his companions had received 1
from Mexican authorities that it would 1
be safe to resume operations at Cusi- M
hulrachic. the department says: M
Knowing that the Cusi mines wer 1
situated at Cusi and that the purpose JH
of the return of Watson and compau M
ions to Mexico was to resume the op- M
oration of tehsemines, the immigra- 1
tlon authoritrernn Juarez upon tho (H
application of the El Paso agent of tho H
Cusi company gave a general pass- H
port to the Watson party. The gov- H
ernor ot Chihuahua also gave a per . 1
sonal passport to Watson, , M
Watson Obtains Mexican Guard. , H
"Watson went to Chihuahua and j
was there on January 4 to ascertain iM
if it would be safe to resume opera- M
tions. While there he got the de facto !,
government to send a garrison and M
maintain it at Cusi On that day three
trains of troops of twenty cars each. j fl
supposed to carry a total force oi j H
1,000 men. in charge of General Joso
Cavazos of the de facto governmen H
left Chihuahua for Cusi at 9 a. m. and j H
1'30 and 4 p. m. respectively. Tho jH
1-30 train also carried the Mexican M
civilians Lopez and Loweree. employ- H
es of tho Cusi Mining company, Ed- j 'H
uardo Enriquez, employe of the Cusi 1
Mexicana company and Pascual '
Aliagia, employo of the Minas San M
Juany Anexes company, another M
American owned company in the Cusi 1
camp. Enriquez is a brother of the j
de facto governor of the state of Chi- I iB
buahua. After being satisfied that a
garrison was going to the camp and jl
after tho second military train had left , H
Chihuahua, Watson left El Paso at 1 ( H
p. m. M
"On January 6, the Chihuahua agent H
of the Cusi company, with whom I H
have just talked in my office, tele- H
graphed Watson at EI Paso in refer- H
once to the above mentioned civilian jM
passengers on said second military H
train, information received by him H
from Cusi by telephone as follows: M
" 'Boys arrived Cusi safely last M
night. They found everything quiet H
over there.' H
Watson Wires For Assurance. B
"As this telegram mentioned the B
boys without mentioning the troops,
Watson on the same day, to make cer- n
tain that a garrison was established
at Cusi, telegraphed the Chihuahua H
agent: H
" 'Wire if troops arrived Cusi and M
train running Northwestern.' "-' 1
To which, the chihuahua agent ro- M
on the same day: M
" 'Troops arrived Cusi. Since yes m
