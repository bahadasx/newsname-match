BERLIN, Jan. 17. Count Tlsza an

that Montenegro has asked Austria
Tor peace, dispatches said.
The peace proposals did not com
as a surprise for It had lieen reported
unofficially that Montenegro had ask
ed for an armistice when the Austri-!
ans swept victoriously into CettinJe i
lil.Hioiunt engagements are believed

Montencgrin Irregulars. Moil-1
tenegro declared war on Austria Au. I
gust 7. 1914, and on Germany August)
u. The Montenegrins Invaded Bosnia)
and Herzegovina, cooperating trial
the Serbians. Despite the fact they j
are poorly equipped and unable to
make much progress, they held a:
small portion of the Invaded territory
until recently. Their fighting was
with the ferocity of fanaticism. Com-;
pared with the forces hurled against j
them the Montenegrins were scarcely j
more than a handful. It is reported!
they never had an army of more than j
50,000. The Montenegrin crisis came
with the culmination of the Teutonic
c-mpalgn In Serbia when the Austri-1
ans turned their attention to the In
vasion of the little country. Within
the past few weeks they have swept
victoriously over the entire state af
ter surmounting supposedly Impreg
nable difficulties at Mount LoWCOn.
With the occupation of CettinJe Mon
tenegro faced extermination and de
cided not to continue the struggle.
ATHENS, Jan. 17. Reports that
Austria and Montenegro have agreed
on an armistice were corroborated by
newspaper advices, but not officially
confirmed.
