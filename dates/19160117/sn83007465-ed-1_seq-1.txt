Gentlemen of the General A

In my annual message I st

you a special message dealir

Insane. You have courteous

At the outset, I wish to sta
clearly that in referring to tl
conditions which I found the
when I became governor,
must not be regarded as a pe
sonal criticism, but rather
statement of facts and cone

whole situation, and its needs.

n' Washington, Jan. 16.?Gen.
Carranza today renewed his asl(j
surances to the United States
that he would make every effort

j the murders of Americans near
j Santa Ysabel.

;o in reply to the department's demand
that the murderers be run

ders for the immediate pursuit,

The dispatch from Consul
Silliman follows:
L "Department's telegram of
January 13, 5 p. m., massacre
.v Americans at Santa Ysabel, rej
ceived at 8:20, and implaced beI
fore Gen. Carranza by me in
ie i person. Gen. Carranza said that
he had already issued orders for
11 i the immediate pursuit, capture
and punishment of those re^
sponsible for the atrocity. He
r" stated that he believed this out?
j rage was committed by men as,r
sociated directly with Villa and
! that it was done specially to
' provoke international troubles
u at this time. He said he had de:e
clared those responsible outside
^ the law, to be punished with
n death if caught.
y "He appeals to the secretary
of state and to the public of the
n United States to consider the
1_ wide strip of the Cenral railway
e' the great difficulty of guarding
t the entire distance, and the
comparatively easy task of des*
troying a train or attacking a
r small place. He says that non
body can lament more than he
s | such an atrocity or be more cone
cerned about it, but that protection
is relative and that even
l~ in the best negulated (?) states
r outbursts of disorders and lawlessness
may cause destruction

"j "He says he is expecting full
e I reports from Gen. Trevino, and
?! that all efforts will be made to
? I protect Americans and any oth"
I er forpicners who mnv hp in thp

was made premediatively

H the raid."
I Oarranza's telegram today to
his embassy here follows:
j j "The government, under my
i direction, has adopted every
"(necessary measure to insure
^ i the prosecution of an energetic

The injured: L. Miles, Ramond

The detonation was terrific,
| but the submarine itself, from
] the outside, shows no effects.
The interior was badly shat,
tered, but so tight was the vesi
sel's shell that there was no
means of escape for gas and it
was more than an hour after
the blast before the work of recovering
the bodies could be
completed. A ladder blown up

The injured and one body
were removed soon after the accident,

down in the craft could not be
reached until the pas had been
blown out by compressed air.
Soon after the explosion several
naval officers led a rescue party
but it were partly overcome by
fumes. It was then that compressed
air pipes were run into
the shell.
The number of men inside
the submarine at the time of
i the explosion is not known
definitely. About twenty were
working on the craft.

Admiral Nathaniel R. Usher,
commandant of the navy yard,
after a brief investigation, declined
to express an opinion. He
said:
"The men were working in
the battery companment of the
E-2, discharging the new Edison
batteries through a rheostat
to measure the voltage, and
the explosion occurred in that
compartment. The battery
will generate no kind of gas
and there was no gasoline on
J board. The engine was of the
J oil burning Dysel type.
Pending the appointment of
I an official board of inquiry Rear
: Admiral Usher named a temporary
investigating committee

Lieut. Commander Pope, i
Washington, commander of the

j M. Stewart, of the torpedo boat,
i destroyer McCall, and Lieut.,
! Rush H. Fay, commander of the
submarine division to which
the E-2 was attached. This
committee immediately began
to take the testimony. ,
The opinion was expressed
that the press of withdrawing;
ine cnarge irom tne batteries
might have caused the formation
of hydrogen gas. The explosions
of that nature have
been frequent on all submarines
of the navy and slight ones
have occurred on American
boats.
