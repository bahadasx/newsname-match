New York, Jan. 16. Dr. Alexander
Graham Bell, it was announced . to

Edison Battery .
ri Not Responsible
FOR EXPLOSION ON THE SUBMA
RINE AT N. Y. NAVY YARD t
A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY
Discloses Fact That the Battery in ths
' E-2 Wae Not Injured in the Least
- Several of Those Injured Are in a
Serious Condition. , - "
New York, Jan. IS. A statement in
dicating that the new Edison storage
battery was not in any way responsi
ble for the explosion which killed four
and injured ten others on the sub
marine E-2 at the New York navy yard
yesterday was made tonight by -Miller
Reese Hutchinson, chief engineer for
Thomas A. Edison and a member of
the naval consulting board.
A Preliminary Inquiry.
The preliminary inquiry into the ex
plosion was held In secret today by the
board of inquiry appointed by Rear
Admiral Nathaniel R. Usher, com
mandant of the navy yard. Neither
Admiral Usher nor any of those pres
ent would discuss what transpired.
Persons on board or near the E-2
at the time of the explosion were ques
tioned at length. Rear Admiral Usher
made the formal statement tonight:
"The board of inquiry met today and
went aboard the submarine, where they
conducted a thorough investigation,
The Investigation was not finished and
therefore the board will meet again
tomorrow. No conclusion was reach
ed."
Inquirers Turned Away.
Secretary of the Navy Daniels, who
is expected to name tomorrow the
board of inquiry to conduct a formal
investigation, left for Washington
without making any statement. At the
navy yard inquirers were turned away
with the statement that Rear Admiral
Usher- and others conducting the in
quiry had nothing to say.
No Official Theory.
Nothing approximating an official
theory as to the cause of the explosion
which resulted in the death of four
Workmen and the Injury of ten others
was obtainable. . The only light shed
upon the disaster was contained in the
statement of Mr. Hutchinson, who ab
solved from blame the Edison battery
designed to minimize, the danger to
submarine crews resulting from ac
cumulations of gas. The E-2 was the
only boat thus far equppled with the
batteries, the tests of which 'were re-.
portstTt. tovbe-'thcrwslily satitrtactory,
- Complete Inspection Made.
"I have made a complete inspection
of the interior of the submarine E-2
as conditions will at present admit,'
said Mr. Hutchinson. "This inspec
tion was made as Mr.' Edison's chief
engineer and personal representative.
I have formed a tentative opinion. This
I have transmitted to the commandant
of the New York navy yard, under
whose jurisdiction this boat was on
Jan. 15, 1916. It ie subject to revision
when all the facts are brought forth
by the board of Inquiry which Admiral
Usher has ordered.
"Having been present at the - pre
liminary inspection, I consider I am
bound by the same rules and regula
tions as is a naval officer in matters
of a confidential nature, and must re
fer you to Admiral Usher for such In
formation as he may be in possession
and inclined to give.
Battery Not Injured.
"As to the Edison attery. with all
the facts and conditions before me, I
see no reason to recommend ' to Mr.
Edison anv changes or alterations in
the theory, construction or method of
Installation of the Edison submarine
type storage battery. The battery in
the E-2 does not appear to have been
Injured in the least."
Marines on Guard.
A large number of persons went to
the navy yard this afternoon to view
the wreck of the submarine,, but ma
rines on guard prevented them from
going closer than 12 or 15 feet.
8everal of Injured in Serious Condition
At the hospitals where the injured
were taken it was said several of them
were in a serious condition, and one
Is expected to die.

-E-2" said the statement. I immedi
ately opon hearing of the accident I
communicated with Rear Admirals
Usher, commandant of the New York

drawn to Horn's credit the day after

the embassy accounts, it was said,
2,000 was paid to Von Papen within

NO SETTLEMENT OF

German Foreign Office Believes the
Announcement Wae Premature.
Berlin, via London, Jan. 16. The
German foreign office believes that any
announcement regarding a final settle
ment or the Lusitania case is slightly
premature. No report to thia effect
has yet been received from Count Von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador at
Washington. On the contrary, it is
Inferred here that - negotiations are
still - pending, but not the slightest
doubt la expressed that a settlement
will be reached In the immediate fu
ture. - ----- - ... -f - -. - .
The' Mediterranean problem Is re
garded here as absolutely settled, the
German government, - as - previously
stated, . considering that their - sub
marines in this and other areas which
have not been proclaimed as war zones
are operating under all the recognized
rules of "cruiser warfare."' " These
submarines differ from regular cruisers
only in that they are traveling under
water instead of upon the surface.
When the distinction .between this
"cruiser warfare" and the reprisal op
erations in the war zone around the
British Isles is comprehended in Ger
many, it is thought, this settlement of
the Mediterranean problem will be ac
cepted and proclaimed by aU parties.'
