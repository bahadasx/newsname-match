KAISER, COMPLETELY RECOVERED,
REJOINS HIS TROOPS AT FRONT
Berlin, Jan. 16.?The following official communication was issued
to-day:
After his complete recovery, Kmperor William returned Sunday
afternoon to the war theatre."
"Zellgewebentzuendiinj*;." reported to be the Kaiser's affliction on
December 22, started the crop of rumors which had the German Km?
peror many times near death. These reports, coming from Rome,
Paris and London, declared that the War Lord was suffering from a
cancer of the throat, the result of an earlier ailment.
One French dispatch declared that the Kaiser had lost the power
of speech and that he had offered 100.00'J francs to a French surgeon
to come to Berlin and fit him with an artificial larynx. The Kaiser has
been sickly from boyhood. Recently Berlin officially admitted that he
was slightly ill The?? facts lent some color to the reports.
German dispatches have insisted either that the Emperor was suf?
fering from "zellgewebent/uenduni?,," meaning thereby cellulitis, or a
carbuncle.
Wilson Tempts Foreign
Peril to Save His Party
Victory Over the Kaiser I le Must Have, and von
Bernstorff Is Ready to Bestow It
?for a Price.
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
[By Telegraph to Th.- Tribune.]
W? hington, Jan. 16. To understand the present crisia in American
foreign relations, to perceive the exact condition? under which the United
?States is now to enter into a travo and prolonged dispute with Great
Britain and her Allies, it [a necessary to review the origin and prognes
of the Wilson diplomacy and the purpose that ha-, dictated it.
Prom the beginning Mr. Wilson'? parp?os has been fixed. To-day,
a-? at all time? since Augii-t, 1 '.? 14, his one determination is to keep the
country oat of the ?rar. His difficulties and the country's dangen and
humiliation- have all resulted from the fact that the administration lacked
the triskMti the courage and the experience which would have provided a
policy consistent with its purpose.
At the outsit of the war -Mr. Wilson issued his famous neutrality
proclamation. Thia document, gravely as it injured the pride ami deeply
as it humiliated a fraction of Americans, wa.- consistent with Mr. Wil?
son's purpi.se to keep the country out of war, ami :t was substantially
id by the country it seif.
Hut the neutrality proclamation had a consequence wholly unfore?
seen at th? moment, hardly appreciated even now. We had signad The
Hague Conventions, which prescribed the inviolability of neutralized ter?
ritory and Otherwise regulated the character of civilized \ arfare. It was
possible for the United States t.i go back on its signature and to abstain
from action or protest when tlie.-e conventions were disregarded by the
Germans in their invasion of Belgium. Once this course was adopted,
however, it was *no longer possible for the United States to pose as the
champion Of international law- at least, not until i' should begin by pro
testing against the German violations of The Hague Conventions.
wil.so.vs POLICY BREAKS Down.
Until the Germans issued their submarine blockade warning, in Feb?
ruary .Mr. Wilson's purpose ar.-l hi? policy stood on all fours. But th"
? ibmarine announcement raised new questions. In the face of these Mr.
Wilson'- policy broke down. In tact, he abandoned it. Instead of nsifen?
?ng American lights ;is he had abandoned America's aignatun to The
Hague Convention-, he issued his "strict accountability" note.
This was an ultimatum, ami as auch promptly involved the United
Stares in a for? ign complication. Unfortunately, Mr. Wilson's sdvisera
had toi?! him that Germany would not disregard his warning and that his
words would thrill the country. His words did thrill the country, hut the
Germans sunk the Lusitania.
W? were then involved in a perilous -ituation. but Mr. Wilson's pur
? . ? to keep out of war was unchanged. Therefore he fell back on
note writing. But in his notes he had to live up to the "strict accounta
nihty" tone because it had thrilled the country, and he was led step by
btep by 'he temptation- of rhetoric into the assertion that it was Amer?
ica's purpose to defend international law.
Defending international law i-, of course, a noble mission, but not
nectsssarily calculated to keep a nation out of war. since it may become
necessary to def?end by fore. Thus for ? very long time thi.-. country was
? .-in unjf'1 mi paff? 8. o-iluinn 4
