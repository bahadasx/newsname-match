Kalakaua avenue paving plans will
be materially changed if the desires
of a group of property-oVners who
met this morning in the Youne hotel
are complied with tomorrow night by
the board of supervisors.
More than a dozen owners and rcp
tesentatives of owners of Kalakaua
avenue frontage met in the makai pa
vilion of the hotel and decided with
erne dissenting vote to advocate the
c-ltv'a navinz fiO ner cent of the total
-ot nf the imDrovement. The proper
tyiownera also generally aeeraed to
favor warrcnlte as the paving material
to be used.!
If either or both of these desires
s pa a ere a in hv t h board the Kala
kaua improvement will be considerab
ly changed. Tne supervisors nave
been advertising the improvement and
tomorrow night a definite decision is
in Ho ronrhAri The DroDosal as adver
tised is that the city pay one-third of
the cost, the remainder to oe oorne
by the abutting property, and it was
declared at this morning's meeting
that the supervisors almost undoubt
edly will favor concrete as the paving
material
The meeting was called last week,
largely by attorneys on behalf of in
terested propertyowners. and those
present thia morning were very large
ly auchi attorneys.
Threa Main Features.
The discussion of the meeting re
solved ntL substantially Into the fol
lowing features:. ":'.'
1. Do the iJ?opertywners agree
'that'th eity ahall pay one-third and
the frontage property two-thlrda of the
Improvement! , , -."- "
X. What paving : material do the
property-owners wish! :
3. Are the property-owners willing
to abide by the present plan of assess
lng tb property fronting on Kalakaua
avenue, or do they . wish to have a
"zone- created by which property not
fronting directly on the avenue, but
lying adjacent, shall share the cost
of the Improvement.
To the first question there was im
mediate and virtually unanimous dis
agreement Several speakers declared
that Kalakaua avenue Is so much a
main thoroughfare that the city's gen
eral funds should pay more than dne
third of the cost of improvement. It
was recited that on a Manoa street
the city is proposing to pay as high
as 25 per cent of the cost, and no Ma
noa street is as characteristically a
main thoroughfares-benefiting all the
city and used by general city traffic
as Kalakaua, One or two suggestions
were heard that the city should stand
60 per cent of the cost, but when senti
ment had crystallzed a little a motion
to urge that the city pay one-half the
cost carried easily.
Comments Vary on Paving. t
Discussion on the second question
was long and various opinions were
heard. In the beginning Attorney U
J. Warren, who acted aa chairman of.
the meeting, called on o. n. uere,
former city engineer and now superin
tendent of the Bishop estate, for a
statement on the comparative cost of
various materials. Mr. Gere gave the
following figures as the estimates of
the city engineering department for
the Kalakaua avenue improvement:
Bitulithic (or warrenlte), 12.20 per
square yard.
Concrete, 11.60 per square yard.
Asphalt-macadam, 11.10 per square

Carrying wrecking gear of all kinds,
the Inter-Island steamer Wailele left
at 1 o'clock this afternoon, in com
mand of Capt. Louis Self, for Port Al

bark British Yeoman, which Is drag

windjammer Edward. Sewall went
ashore at Kahulul.
Alexander & Baldwin reported at
noon that they believed most of the
cargo remaining on the British Yeo
man could be saved, as it is lumber
and will keep the ship afloat. About
half the bark's lumber cargo, valued
at $10,000, had been unloaded before
the kona gale began to endanger the
craft.
Late yesterday afternoon the schoon.
er Prosper, Capt. Murchison, broke
adrift at Port Allen and. drove ashore
at the mouth of the Hanapepe river.
The Prosper left Mukllteo November

All but 200 tons, worth $1400, had
been discharged before . the storm
came up.
The Prosper began drifting beach-
ward about 2 o'clock yesterday, after
noon. Capt. Murchison tried to steer
his ship into the mouth of the river,
but at the last moment his ship struck
a rocky ledge with a crash that could
be heard ashore
Capt. Nelson. and five men of the
British - Yeoman, going to the Pros-
ner's assistance in a small boat, ere
unable to reach the schooner. Their
boat capsized, the men were thrown
nto the surf but managed, by tne

Cant. Neil Murchison, skipper or tne

Governor Pinkham today made ib

of territorial departments urslng that
employes of the territory join tne .Na
tional Guard and Instructing the de
partment heads to give preference. In
handling their prncial work, to mem
bera of the guard.
The letter follows: v
Territory of Hawaii, IT. S. A.
Executive .Chamber.
Honolulu, January 13, 1916.
To the Heads of Departments.
Territory of Hawaii.
Sirs: -
In conformity with the expressed
policy of the Honorable Secretary of
War, the Commanding General or the
Hawaiian Department and my onn ad
vocacy, as : Governor, the National
Guard of Hawaii has been so in
creased in number that it is regarded
as an example to the mainland states
and has the admiration of the military
authorities of the United States.
To the intense activities of Briga
dier General Johnson is "due the en
rolment of over Four Thousand men
in the Territory; of which some Twenty-five
Hundred have Hawaiian hlcod.
There should be not only patriotic
j)ut material incentive in belonging
to the National Guard or Hawaii.
What military acts and provisions
may be made by Congress for citizen
soldiery is aa. yet undetermined. :
We must maintain our numbers and
interest v by ipldylng-. th veans at
hand. v 'S.':"-
, I believe it the duty of every physi
cally and mentally fit male employe,
of suitable age, of the Government to
join the National Guard of Hawaii.
That present members may be en
couraged, I desire the Heads of De
partments, where vacancies exist or
occur, to give preference to members
of the National Guard, according as
opportunities for skilled or unskilled
labor exist
HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS WILL
SEE TO IT THAT THE ABOVE EM-
PLOYMENT POLICY IS CARRIED
OUT. .
Employes are urged to at once per
form their duty by enlisting.
Efforts are being made to secure
the means to reasonably and properly
pay the members of the National
Guard for their services.
This is not the place to discuss this
point, but much will depend on the
attitude of the rank and file cf the
Guard on the economic proposals to
be presentea.
I do not expect war but I do expect
the people of the Hawaiian Islands to
be in position to immediately have
something to say and do in their own
behalf and protection the instant a
foe presumes to attack otir shores.
I further expect the military exer
cises and affiliations of the Guard will
prove an immeasurable benefit in the
social life of the islands and a relief
from the commonplace tediousness
that often affects country life.
There is a lack of employment and
suffering to such an extent I advise
employers generally to bear in mind
the needs of members of the National
Guard,
Respectfully,
LUCIUS E. PINKHAM.
Governor and Commander-in-Chief of
the National Guard of Hawaii.
