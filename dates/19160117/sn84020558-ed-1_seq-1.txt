Police Labor for Naught
Yesterday afternoon members of the
Phoenix police department were called
to the vicinity of Twelfth and Jeffer
son streets to extricate a horse owned
by Wo Kee, a Chinese laundryman.
The animal had fallen into a hole in
the road and had been unable lo free
itself from( the gripping embrace of
the wet adobe.
A sewer had recently been dug across
- the roadway and the rainfall had
caused a portion of the earth which
had been filled in the hole to sink
down and become a veritable trap to
any living object that might happen to
step in. The police responded to the
distress call. After about an hour's
hard labor, with the use of a block
and tackle, the animal-was finally
pulled out of the hole and placed on his
feet again. The officers, who had be
come encrusted with mud and slime to
a degree which rendered it -hard to
distinguish them as human beings, had

Curranza today renewed his assur
ances to t iie I'nited States that he

rranza nad personally assured Mr.
Siliiman, in reply to the department's
demand that the murderers be run
down, that he "had issued orders
for the immediate pursuit, capture
and punishment of those responsible
for the atrocity."
Simultaneously, in a dispatch to
F.liseo Arredondo, his ambassador

nounced that he was anout to issue
a decree permitting; any citizen of
Mexican nationality to shoot the ban
dits "without formality."
Assurances that "condign punislu
nient" would be visited upon the mur
derers had already been given tile
sitae department through .Mr Arre
dondo Whether a formal note from
Carranza is to follow has not been
revealed.
Carranza's telegram to his em
bassy here follows:
"The government, under my direc
tion, has adopted every necessary
measure to inctire the prosecution of
an energetic campaign for the cap
ture and destruction of the party of
Villista bandits and to continue the
same to its complete accomplishment.
1 have asked General Jacinto H. Tre
vino, commanding; the constitutional
ist troops in the neighborhood of the
assassinations, to secure the names
of the assassins, so that a decree may
be issued placing them outside the
pale of law. When this is done any
citizen or citizens of the republic will
have the right to arrest the guilty
parties without other warrant and to
execute them without formality.
"Similar decrees were issued and
executed etfectively in the cases of
issaults and dvnamitii.g of trains in
another section of the republic within
ihe year, notably when a passenger
train was dynamited and its passen
gers assaulted near Apizaco and again
near Jalapa. These dec rees are made
effective because in the opinion ol
the government those who perpeti.ite
such assassinations of human beings,
be the victims native Mexicans or for

acly the same category as those who
dvnemila the railway trains. I sin

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16. The prob

can lite and property in Mexico, re
vived hy the Santa Ysabel murders, is
expected by congressional leaders to he
a dominant subject in the proceedings
of both houses the coming week. Issues
atising from the European war have
been completely overshadowed by it
and conservation bills and other im
portant legislative measures under con
sideration are not drawing the atten
tion that would ordinarily be given
them.
There is certain to be more of the
fervid discussion of the Mexican prob
lem that enlivened sessions of the past
week. Members of the house and sen
ate are unanimous in their insistence
that the Santa Ysabel bandits be pun
ished but the majority oppose any step
thit would result in intervention,
which must be destruction of the de
facto government the United States
anil the Pan-American nations led in
establishing.
Mexico wil be the basis of formal
consideration by the senate foreign re
lations committee beginning Wednes
day, when the nomination of Henry
Prather Fletcher as ambassador to
General Carranza's government will be
taken, up.
Discussion of the Mexican problem
on the floor of the senate and house is
exrected to arise from consideration of
various intervention resolutions. No
committee actio mm such resolutions is
probable at this time. Senator Gore of
Oklahoma, democrat, is considering
submitting a resolution to direct the
use of American aimed forces as aids
to the Carranza forces in protecting
American citizens and a neutral zone
in Mexico.
Legislation in congress is progressing
slowly, none of the supply hills being
cny where near ready for discussion.
The house has passed the administra
