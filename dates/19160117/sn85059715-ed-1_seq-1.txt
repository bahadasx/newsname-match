Russian Offensive Along Front
of One Hundred Miles is
on at Present.
ATTACK BEING PRESSED ;
Assaults on the Turkish Positions
by Russian Forces
Are All Repulsed. !
The Russian operations in the Caucasus
are growing in magnitude and ,
importance from the indications furnished
by the official reports. Following
closely the announcement
from Constantinople that a Russian ,
offensive along a 100-mile front south
of the Arasa had been inaugurated
comes the further news that the attack
Is being phessed although the A
Turkish war ofllce declares that the I
attempts to make headway have lacked ^
success. Assaults of the most dc-;
termined character on the Turkish
positions have been successfully repulsed,
it-ia declared, and the Russian
forces have had heavy losses Inflicted
upon them.
Military observers have been expect-1
ing for sometime developments of a
notable character in this section. When |c
Grand Duke Nicholas wns sent to take ""
charge in the Caucasus It was Intimated
In the Imperial order announcing
the change that additional attention
would ba given the operations on
that front. These have been slow In el
developing in magnitude but it now pl
appears that the preparations have nl
been made and the drive Into the in- CI
terior is being attempted, The move i m
is doubtless in conjunction with the; 0j
I British operations In nearby Mosopo-1 m
tamia and the Russian activity In Per-; pi
sla. m
Important developments on the j ^
other fronts are lacking. j sc
Russia has again Blackened its ac-: pl
tlvltles In Bessarabia, but the Aus-1
trian pursuit of the Montenegrins <Dl
Is being continued with the latter tl,
falling back toward Scutari. The, n|
Serbian government has established w
