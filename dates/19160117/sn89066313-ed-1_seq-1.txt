II. S. Varner, "Ayr." Senior,
Tells of Marriage to Miss
Josephine Breitweiser,
MET FIVE YEARS AGO
COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, MONDAY, JANUARY 17, 1916
NUMBER 117
THEY SAY-
Were Wed in Sedalia Bride
Stenographer in Univer
sitv Office.
When thi'ir friejids saw them to
gether so much last fall, saw them eat
together three times a day ami per
haps observed an attitude on the part
nf boh a little more indifferent than
would he expected under ordinary cir
cumstances well, the friends watch
ed and wandered.
Hut an explanation did not come
until this morning.
Many had hinted that the couple
were married. And so they were.
Hut II. S. Varner, a senior in the
College of Agriculture, and Miss Jose
ptiine Breiiweiser, a stenographer in
the I'niversity business office, suc
ceeded in keeping their marriage a
secret for over four months.
.Met Five Years Ago.
The friendship of the couple began
five years ago Ln St. Joseph, Mr.
Varner s home. Miss Hreitweiser
went 'o St. Joseph from Upland, Xeb.,
to make her home with her brother,
owner or a lie stock commission
firm.
A jvar and a half ago, Mr. Varner
prevailed upon his fiancee to come to
Columbia, where she accepted a steno
graphic position in the University.
Last September when he was on a
trip, he persuaded her to slip away
from the business office at the week
end. Meeting in Sedalia September 11,
they were married, and Mrs. Varner
returned o Columbia, still remaining
Miss Hreitweiser to her friends.
Kadi Kept UN Secret.
While 1 was waiting in the station
fur Miss Hreitweiser at Sedalia," said
Mr. arner, "I mel w. 1!. Combs, as
sistant in dairying. We exchanged a
few words but neither of us told our
purpose in being there. We were both
married a few moments afterwards."
When asked why the marriage was
kept secret, Mr. Varner said that last
spring he promised three of his
friends. T. A. Evving, J. W. Hurch and
E. S. Mat'eson, members of the Col
lege of Agriculture stock judging
team, to rent rooms with them for
the winter, and so he stood by the
agreement. Mr. Varner is also a
member of the stock judging team.
.Mr. Kwing, Mr. Hurch and Mr. Mat
teson will leave the University at the
end of ihe first semester. Mr. Var
ner u ill receive his degree in June.

I '-One or the greatest needs of Colum
bia," says II. I). .Muiry, a lawyer ho
has lived most of his life in and near
Columbia, "is a big.
new hotel. And the
kind of hotel I
think we ought to
have is different
from tho ordinary
commercial hotel. I
would call it a fam
ily hotel.
"Vou see, a great
many fathers and
mothers of students
come here during the year, as well as
a big host of visitors. What could
- more impressive and at the same
time more comfortable for these vis
itors than a beautiful, roomy place
in which to stay and rest? I tell vou.
such a hotel would advertise Colum
bia more than anything else.
".My notion is that a hotel of this
kind should lie built at some distance
from tlie business district so tiiat the
guests could enjoy fresh air. And
we ought to have tennis courts and
a golf course connected with it. With
these attractions of grounds and
building Columbia would soon be
known all over the state and even
in other states as a place not only
for education but also for up-to-date
accommodations.
"Would it pay? Of course it would
People are always willing to pay for
what is good and pleasing. And we
might have a few little parks scat
tered here and there about the city,
and have a boulevard connecting
them. We'd have the boulevard run
right past the hotel and but I guess
that's enough city planning for one
day."

style in clothing. Two students from
Canada were doing some exhibition
skating last Saturday, cutting four

but the hunters of Boone County are
not so anious for Jack Frost to pro

the number of quail in Boone County.
At present a thick coating of Ice
and snow on the ground makes it al
most impossible for the birds to get
anything to eat. In the summer there
is a plentiful supply of grain, berries
and bugs for the quail, but in the win
ter the game depends entirely on what
it can pick from the ground for its
sustenance, and snow and Ice form the
quail's "high cost of living." Hunters
say that although the present weather
conditions are not very dangerous,
another snow would mean starvation
to manv birds.
The largo number of quail, rabbits
and squirrels found near Columbia
this year have made hunt"r3 unusually
numerous, but just now the immediate
