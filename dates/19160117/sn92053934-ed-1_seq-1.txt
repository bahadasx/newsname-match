De Facto Officials Are Made

Americans.
EVIDENCE IS GATHERED
State Department Says In
vestigation of Tragedy
Reveals Blame.
Washington, Jan. 17. Establish
ment of a neutral zone in north
ern Mexico to be jointly policed
by the forces of Mexico and the
United States, unless disorders are
speedily controlled, is proposed in
a resolution introduced today by
Senator Gore, democrat, of Okla
homa. Evidence collected at El Paso by
state department agents indicates that
Carranza authorities at Chihuahua as
sured C. R. Watson, head of the party
of Americans killed near Santa Ysa-
bel, that no escort was necessary. In
that opinion, however, many of the
Americans agreed, although they had
suggested to the authorities the advis
ability of sending troops with the
party.
Gave Passports.
The advices further stated that the
Carranza governor of Chihuahua gave
Watson a personal passport and that
the Carranza immigration authorities
in Juarez gave a general passport for
the whole Watson party. These devel
opments are taken to point to the re
sponsibility of the Carranza govern
ment for not adequately protecting
the Americans.
Concentration of Americans at Tor
reon, Monterey and other points where
Carranza troops can afford them great
er protection was reported to the state
department today by Consul General
Hanna at Monterey.
Carranza In Earnest.

General Trevino assured Carranza! 5
that "sternest measures woum ne

Apprehension felt regarding the
safety of Vice Consul Coen at Duran
go was allayed today by the receipt
of a dispatch from him reporting F. 0.
Emerson, regarding whom inquiries
had been made, safe at Durango.
According to state department ad
vices, Holmes, the only survivor of
the massacre, had no knowledge as tt J
whether Watson and his companions
requested a military escort on their
trip from Chihuahua to Cusihuirachic.
The Mexican immigration authori
ties, according to the state department,
issued general passports to the Wat-,
son party and the governor of Chihua- j
hua gave a personal passport to Wat- j
son. The latter arranged at Chihua-;
hua to have Cusi. the location of the
mines, garnsonea, anu Jan. , tnree
trains, said to carry 1,000 de facto
troops, left Chihuahua for Cusi.
Watson then returned to El Paso
and heard by telegraph from Chi
huahua that the troops had arrived at
Cusi.
A paraphrase of its official advices,
given out by the state department
adds:
"Having passports issued by the au
thorities, and a garrison having been
established, which they understood to
number 1,000 men, they had ample as
surances that it would be safe to re
sume operations at Cusi."

BROTHERS PLAN
TOSLAYPARENTS
FOR THEIR HONEY
Chicago, Jan. 17. Civing and Her
bert Updike, brothers, arrested last
night after police had obtained evi
dence of an alleged pi-', to murder
their father, Furman D. Updike, a re
tired broker, their mcher and sister,
were still in custody today. Civing,
who is 32, years old, is a member of
the Chicago board of trade. Chief of
Police Lee of Oak Park, a suburb, in
whici the Updike family resides, said
that Herbert, 22 years old, was being
held merely as a corroborative wit
ness, but he refused to tell what
charge, if any, had been lodged against
Civing, the elder son.
According to the police, a steno
graphic copy of the conversation be
tween the two young men in the Up
dike garage, gave derails of an al
leged plot to kill Mr. and Mrs. Up
dike, because, the police sa7 the son
feared his father would alter his will,
and leave the greater portion of his
estate to other members of the family.
"Civing told me first he was going
to kill father and mother more than a
year ago," the youngest son told the
police. "We used to go down in the
basement nights and talk about It. He
was going to poison them and he
bought the poison, but he had to go
west and he gave up the idea. He
came back in November and immed
iately started to talk about it again.
He had it all planned for the night of
Jan. 4 and I guess it would have hap
pened then if mother had not thought
il was cold and closed the windows.
The ladder was placed under the win
dow and Civing had started to climb
it."
When arrested, according to the po
lice, Civing first tried to implicate his
brother, and then made a complete
confession. The officers were hidden
in the garage where they took a
stenographic report of the conversa
tion between the brothers, and later,
they say they found a shot gun and
two automatic pistols, equipped with
silencers. .
Civings automobile, with the en
gine running, stood in front of the
house. According to Herbert, after
the proposed murder, it was planned
to motcr to the Desplaines river and
throw the weapons into the ater and
then return to, bed and await there
the discovery of the crime this morn-
, inS-
An attempt is to be made to show
that Civing Updike is not sane, accord
