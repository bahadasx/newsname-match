.Last Year the January Cold

r Until 29th."
With theAow beginning last night
In the "gloaming," us the poet says,
real winter weather arrived and tow

sou. According to the official report
of the local weather observer, the tem
perature at S A. M. this morning was
two degrees below zero. The r.port of
the local observers at Cincinnati and
Pittsburgh were both the same, being
two degroes below at those plac-s.
This seems to indicate a general cold
wave of much magnitude and uniform
temperatures throughout the Ohio val
ley.
The local preciplatlon was only nine
hundredths of aodffch but the snow
fall, being light and dry, the ground
is covered with enough snow to make
excellent sleighing. But the sound of
slelghbolls Is seldom heard In Fair
mont any more, and has been super
seded by the hoarse squawk of the
Klaxon and the buzz of the tin liz
zie. The familiar sight of Captain
Heed's sleigh filled with happy school
children was missing on the streets
today. Whether the air was too cold
for the Captain, or his horse was in
disposed, could not be learned. Prob
ably the horse, however, for the Cap
tain never fears the weather.
The cord wave in January of last
year did not arrive until lha 29th and
then the lowest temperature was only
8 degrees above zero. The snowfall
last January was very light also, the
heavy precipitation for the month of
5.41 inches being mostly rain.
Several farmers with sleds and
sleighs arrived fn the city this after
noon, lending the town the appearance
of an old-fashioned, winter. The proud

fourth In the number- of automobiles
owned in the county.
While the county ranks fourth, the
city of Fairmont ranks seventh in the
principal cities of the counties.
The following Is the list of the seven
counties and cities named. Fairmont
brings up the rear with a tottal of 333
automobiles, while Wheeling leads the
list with 1,260. Marion county has a

REV F. P. HUMMEL
STRICKEN IN PULPIT
Morgantown Pastor Was
Supernumerary of Local
M. P. Temple.
Dr. J. C. Broomfleld, pastor of the
M. P. Temple and president of the
Pittsburgh conference of the denomi
nation, went to Morgantown this after
noon, where lie was called by the cri
tical illness of Rev. Frank P. Hummel,
pastor of the Morgantown M. P.
church and also a member of the Pitts
burgh conference.
Rev. Mr. Hummel was stricken with
apoplexy last night while filling his
pulpit at the Morgantown church. Dr.
Hummel had Just finished a splendid
sermon on the subject "Found Want
ing" and had picked up a hymnal.to
announce a-hynm numbdgKftff w3ucJi?
he would give an invitation to the" un
saved, when thb book was noticed to
drop from his. fingers. Dr.v Kelly, his
family physician, noticed the book
drop and going to the pulpit urged
Dr. Hummel to retire from the pulpit.
At the conclusion of the hymn and af
terjpronouncing the benediction, Rev.
Hummel sank to tho floor and was
carried from the church. A ?message
received from his bedside today said
he was still uncdnsclous and his re
covery was impossible. Rev. Hummel
was a supernumerary to the local M.
P. Temple and at the conference meet
ing last September was loaned to the
Morgantown church. Dr. Broomfleld,
who was called to Morgantown by his
illness will return tonight.
The'incident of Rev. Mr. Hummers'
stroke, recalls the death in a similar
manner at Llarrackville two years ago,
when Rev. Cieorgo Kinsey, pastor of
the Baptist church there (or some fifty
years, was stricken in practically the
6ame manner and dUd in a few min
utes. ^

INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 17.?'While
delegates to the bl-ennial cqpvention
ot United Mine Workers, which opens
Tuesday, were gathering here today
from different parts of the United
States and Canada officers of the un
ion wore endeavoring to roach an
agreement with ? coal operators from
the central competitive bituminous
district for a wage qpnferenco after
tilt; convention nt 11 1 f"'^
The Cenfcal competitive districts
a:? made up of Illinois, Indiana Oilio
and Western, Pennsylvania soft coat
Holds. The.mine owners in,the jo dis
tricts formerly has a four-etate agree
ment with the union miners but It
was broken up several years ago since
at which time each state ? concluded
Its. own contract with union ooiptoyos.
At a conference here today be
tween officers and union and repre
sentatives of the operators efforts
were being made to bring about a
new interstate agreement. The con
ference is a continuation of one held
in Chicago some days ago.
Western Pennsylvania operators
wore not represented in that confer
ence and when' today's meeting began
there was no indication that they
would participate although some coal
operators from around Pittsburgh are
in town. It Is said the principal ob
jection of the western Ponnsylvanians
to entering an interstate conference
is that in their territory they pay
workers on the screen basis, whereas
in at least two of the other districts,
tho run of mine basis prevails. The
Pennsylvanlans tear that if they go
into an interstate agreement they may
bo outvoted on the question of main
taining a -crpen basis.
Leaders from various districts In
town appear optimistic with regard
to the mining situation. Agreements
expire in many states in the spring
but they express themselves as con
fident /hat new contracts will be made
without trouble. Many of the men ap
pear to reject the views of John P.
White, international president of the
union, who favors the policy of tfie
men remaining at work after their
contracts expire on March 31 so long
as there Is a possibility ot an agree
ment being reachod.
.. In many instances in the, past,',min
ing was suspended by the workers
when agreements expired and negotia
tions were still in progress. A shut
down in the anthracite field four years
ago lastod six weeks. -

Cold Wave Came
Just V^hen Needed
BUT FOR ITS TIMELY APPEAR.
ANCE PEACH TREES MIGHT
HAVE BUDDED.
The zero weather of last , night and
today came just In time to check the
premature development of"peach tree
buds which might have resulted In
serious Injury to the peacli crop In
Marion county, according to state-J
ments by County Agricultural Agent
H. L. Smith today. The snow of last
night and the cold is also beneficial
to the wheat fields, it Is said.
Two much warm weather during the
winter months in this latitude results
in premature development of various
fruits with the results that a drop in
temperature in the late winter or early
spring destroys the swelling fruit budsi
and tha'-proBpect of a crop
While the zero weather of the last
36 hours has been beneficial to fruit
growers and farmers a drop to 10 or
12 degrees below continuing for 48
hours or more might result in such
injury to peach buds as to prevent u|
crop next summer.
Continued cold weather with heav^
snow is beneficial to wheat which will
continue to grow under a blanket of
snow and appear green and flourish
ing when the snow melts. Changes of
temperature during the winter, how
ever, which results in alternate freez
ing and thawing results in injury to
wheat, the roots being torn from the
soil by the action of tha frost.
