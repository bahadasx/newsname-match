The War At a Glance
THE Russian operations in the
Caucasus are growing in im
portance from the indications
furnished by official reports.
Turk Driven Hack
Following closely the announce
ment from Constantinople that a
Russian offensive has been inau
gurated, comes an official Turkish
report by way of Berlin saying that
the Turkish in the Caucasus have
withdrawn their advanced position
seteral miles at some points.
Russians Force the Fighting
Military observers have been ex
pecting for some time developments
of a notable character in this re
gion. 'When grand duke Nicholas
was relieved of the command of the
main Russian armies and sent to
take charge in the Caucasus, it was
intimated in the imperial order an
nouncing the change that additional
attention would be given the opera
tions on that front It now appears
that the drive into the interior is
being attempted. The move is
doubtless in conjunction with the
British operations in nearby Meso
potamia and the Russian activity In
Persia.
Important developments ,n the
other fronts are lacking.

Irving Updike, aged 3S years, is said
to have coerced his brother, 21 years
old, into the plot. Belief -hat the

51 V3ess":to Sayvllle. L. L) The Over-
- eeag News agency announced today
that count Tisza. the Hungarian pre
mier, had announced in the Hungarian
parliament that Montenegro had asked
for peace.
Montenegro offered unconditionally
to lay down her arms and the offer
had been accepted, the premier de
clared, according to the news agency
report.
Montenegro's downfall was seeming
ly complete when Cettinje, the capital,
was occupied. Though the kingdom
still has large forces in. the field, the
failure of the entente powers to send
any adequate reinforcements Is believed
to have convinced Montenegro of the
undesirability of becoming a second
sertia. The Austro-Hungarian armies
now hold almost all of Montenegro.
Causes Joy In Parliament.
The news agency's report follows:
"Montenegro asks for peace, stated
count Tisza in the Hungarian parlia
ment. "The proceedings under the first
paragraph of the order of the day had
just been completed when count Tlsa
asked permission to interrupt the dig-
etission. He stated that the king and
government of Montenegrq had asked
the inauguration of peace negotiations.
7the announcement caused a great
commotion in parliament.
" 'We asked that beforehand Monte
negro unconditionally lay down her
arms,' continued the premier
"Joyful shouts followed this state
ment. "'Just at this moment.' continued
the prime minister, 'the news has
arrived that the unconditional laying
doivn of arms has been accepted
"'Since the preliminary condition has
