Verrict Returned After Deliber-erating-
little More Than Six
Hours Over Evidence in
Murder Case.
DEFENDANT SITS MOTIONLESS
No Word or Change of Expression
Shows Disappointment or
Satisfaction.
WITE CALLS HIM INNOCENT
Arthur Hauser was fouud guilty
of murder In the first degree and
the penalty was fixed at life im
prisonment by the Jury which tried
him on a charge of slaying W. H.
Smith, Woodmen of the World
cashier, at Thirty-first and Dodge
streets, the night of October 16. The
rase went to the Jury at 3:40 Sat
urday afternoon. A verdict was
reached at 10:04. six hours and
twenty-four minutes later.
Hauser, who had scanned eagerly
the faces of the jurors as they filed
into their seats, sat motionless after
the reading of the verdict, until
sheriff's deputies led him away. No
word or change of expression indi
cated either disappointment or sat
isfactlon. In his cell a few moments later,
after he had changed his neat blue
serge suit which he wore at the trial,
for the khaki garb of a prisoner, he
declared: "It was not a fair ver-
tct."
ays Judge Was Fair.
Asked if he believed he had had
fair trial, he said: "I certainly
did have a fair trial before the
judge." He would say nothing more.
The anxiety and mingled hope
and fear which had possessed him
during the last days of the trial
were gone and the cold defiance of
the man whose hand is against so
ciety again ruled him. "Have you
any complaint?" he was asked. "I
have nothing to say." he replied.
It was Hauser who broke down when
hie wife, dry-eyed, was doing the utmost
In her power to free him by her testi
mony, but It was his wife and mother
who wept when the verdict of guHty,hod
been returned. i
Mr.. .May Hauser, JT7-year-old wife ot
the bnndlt, rerelved the news while wett
Iiiji on a trnin to return to her home tn
Wichita. The used mother sat opposite
n a double seat. While the two women
wept, the S-y ear-old child, Llda, slept on
the cushioned eat. . v
' ' Wlf Call Hint lanoeent
"They've convicted an innocent man,"
fobbed the wlte. "I thought twelve men
would be fair. lie Is Innocent ot that
ciline,"
It wan the tint time her tears had
t lowed since she came to Omaha to testify
to an alibi for her husband.
The mother said sho longed for death.
"If you know how a mother feels," she
said, ' you know I would be better off
If I were dead. I wish I were dying
low."
In contrast, a woman across the river
aid: "I am glad. That Is right" It
was the wife of the murdered man. With
her two young children whose
father Hauser had shot to death ay a
bullet fired Into his back. In Council
Bluffs also lives the aged mother of the
dead man, who experienced the first thrill
of pleasure she has known alnce the night
of the murder.
Interest la Keen.
These two women rejoiced that the law's
just vengeance had been visited on the
slayer of Smith. Many friends and ac
quaintances of the dead man expressed
s.-ttlHfsi-iloi'. Interest tn Council Bluffs,
lilx homo during his lifetime, was no less
keen than in Omaha.
1hs Grace Hlater, whom Mr. Smith
was accompanying to her home, when
he was shot, had no statement to make,
rihe had previously expressed confidence
that Hauser would he convicted. She
was the principal state's witness.
When the verdict was returned only
District Jurisa English, Mauser and his
attorneys, Richard Horton and IXJward
V. Rooney of Topeka, Kan., court officers
and a few spectators who had drifted In
were present. Mauser's wife and mother,
who had intended to go home early in
the afternoon, had waited until night by
his request, but had left for the railway
station before the -Jury came lu. They
had waited at the borne of a friend at
1800 Missouri avenue, Albright.
It was learned during the evening that

Actual Closing of Ports of Central
Empires by Allies Likely to

OPINION OF U. S. OFFICIALS
WASHINGTON," Jan. 16. En
forcement by Great Britain of an ac
tual blockade ot the Teutonic
powers would in the opinion of of
ficials here remove from the field
of controversy several International
factors, which have led to much
diplomatic correspondence and much
misunderstanding on the part of the
public.
One of ' these is the question that
now, remains unanswered .as .to the
right fit a ueutrat -sUta lo ship to
Germany or its allies kny goods not
contraband'of War.- (
Once a blockade Was ' declared
there could be no legil question of
the right of the blockade fleet to
keep everything out ff the enemy's
port.
All Doabt Rumored.
All doubt as to the application of the
doctrine of ultimate, destination also
might be. removed so. far as it concerns
goods destined for Germany through a
neutral state. ,
On the other hand, declaration of a
blockade would not warrant, officials be
lieve, interference with America's trade
with neutral European states, provided
the goods were not consigned ultimately
to Germany or Austria. Under the or-dern-ln-oouncll
such goods i are now -being
detained and cbmmandeered.
Will Take Up Qneatlon.
The forthcoming American note to
Oreat Britain on contraband Is expected
to take up this question at length. It
will vigorously asert the right of neutral
states to trade unmolested among them
selves and the prospective change in the
British policy Js not expected to modify
in any wise that stand.
So far the State' department has had
no official Information regarding the re
ported purpose of Great Britain to aban
don the order-ln-councll for an active
blockade.

KANSAS CITY GETS THE FAVORS
Existing: Rates Show Railroads Di-
rerting: Business from Omaha's
Natural Territory.
HGURXS THAT PROVE CHARGES
; ; Better grain rates from Omaha
. between Oklahoma, Arkansas and
J Texas points is one of the things the
j Omaha Grain Exchange is now work
! Ing upon,
i For over four months the Grain
! "exchange officials and their traffic
manager. Ed P. Smith, have worked
! on an elaborate table of facts and
j figures which they Intend to file
I with the Interstate Commerce com
' mission in brief attacking the
rates the roads are charging on
grain from Omaha Into this great ter
, rltory.
Kansas City still has s vast advantage
over Omaha In the freight rales leading
Into this field of consumption.
i ,- DIsrrlsNlaattoa Is tilarlaa.
That there Is vast discrimination against
Omaha and In favor of Kanaaa City In
the matter of these rates, will be charged
Un the brief. It will be shown that Omaha
is handicapped in Its effort to reach
this southern territory, while Kansas
City la favored In Its effort to reach
.the Minneapolis mills through Omaha.
j Here are the facta: Omaha pays S
cents mors to reach Oklahoma, Arkansas
and Texas than Kansas City does; while
Kansas City pays only 1 cent more to
i reach Minneapolis mills than Omaha
-
Thla condition, the grain men here con
tend Is an unjustifiable case of discrim
ination, and they want It rectified.
There Is. a vast demand in Oklahoma,
Arkansas and Texas for Omaha and
Kansas City grain, especially what Is
known as the rough grain, or corn and
oats for feeding purposes.
Naturally the grain men In hoth these
primary grain markets seek the business.
In 11J,- 1913 and 1914 45 per cent ot the
corn and oats tht reached Omaha was
shipped to these three southern states,
according to. Trarfio Manager Smith of
the Grain r Exchange. The next year a
bstter crop , waa raised in the south and
lef was needed from . this section, but
these lf Igurea am given merely to show
tW demand for tnir grsln'ln that Beetle-.
: .... . ,
i ...
Wfcere"bmaha gaffer.
While 'this grain rata to the south Is
one of the big discriminations, the Ex
change will seek to have adjusted before
the Interstate Commerce commission it la
by no means the only discrepancy that
needs attention. Rates In favor of Kansas
City and against Omaha are so gross and
so extensive that the whole trouble can
jby no means be Ironed out in a single
case.
"If we could ever be given the same
rate per ton mile as Kansas City
enjoys," . says Mr. Smith, "Ninety per
cent of our. ratea would be reduced. We
have been fighting and fighting to get
some of these points adjusted, but the
whole rate schedule of the southern part
of our state Is still a constant source
I of Irritation."
Saw Nebraska Case.
Some conspicuous cases may be cited
In the rate over the Burlington from
towns In the southern part ot the stale.
From Wymore to Omaha, for example,
is a distance of 11 miles., From Wymore
to Kansas City the distance Is 14 miles.
Tet the rate Is the same. From Fair
bury to Omaha, the distance is 118 miles:
to Kansas City. 217 miles, yet the rate
Is the same. From Hebron to Omaha,
m miles; to Kansas City.. 263 miles.
I yet the rate Is the same. From Rhlck
. ley to Omaha the distance Is 132 miles;
; to Kansas CHty, 240 miles, with the
i same rate. From Red Cloud to Omaha
j is ISi miles; to Kansas City, V miles,
with the rate the ssme. From Alma to
Omaha is 223 miles; to Kansas City 237
miles, with the rste tho same.
Prior to the fight before the Inter
state Commerce, commission, .which re
sulted In a little readjustment In De
cember, 1913, some still more glaring dla-
j crepenties were in effect.
! Rates that Leek Paaay.
Grain rstes from Auburn to Omaha,
a distance of ninety-six miles, were
W33, while the rste to Kansas City, th
greater distance of 128 miles wss only
t&.36. Thus while the . distance waa
slmost one-half greater to Kansss City,
the rate to that place was a cent a
hundred pounds less. All the commis
sion did in the readjustment at that
time waa to rslse the Kansas City rate
to $9.36. the equal of the Omaha rate,
without taking Into consideration the
greater distance to Kansss Oty.
Practically the same thing was done
with the ratea from Crab Orchard, Te
cumseh and several other points where
the situation wss much similar. This
was some relief, but not satisfactory.
A mortifying situation still standing,
for example. Is the rate from Bracken
and Armour. These tWo towns are tsken
sn Illustration for the simple resson
that It chances that Bracken is 133 miles
irom Kaunas City,, while Armour Is)
exactly 132 miles from Omaha. Brack,
en's grain rate to Kansas City Is IV.26,

' To Edison Battery
NBW YORK, Jan. 1.-A statement in
dicating that the new Edison storsg
battery wss not In sny wsy responsible
for the explosion on the submarine, K-J.
at the New York navy yard yesterday
wss mad tonight by Miller Reese Hutch
inson, chief engineer for Thomas K. Edi
son, and a member f the naval consult
ing board.
The aptness of that figure of
speech, "the cruel cold," is seen in
reading the winter annals of the
poor as they are reported to the
charitable Institutions of Omaha
these bitter days.
The Salvation Army at its indus
trial home, 1112 Dodge street, cared
for a small army of destitute men
during last week. Captain Kline
reports that he gave 650 extra
meals and 35 extra beds to men who
came to him shivering and hungry.
These were given without any pay
ment whatever and .are In addition
to the 415 regular meats served for
his staff of twenty-five workers and
the 280 regular lodgings given at
nominal price.
The Ice harvest provided work for able
bodied men and Captain Kline sent about
2 men to the Ice fields. He provided a
number of thce with overcoats, shoes
snd underclothlmt before they were suf
ficiently clad to do this cold work.
eed More Warm Clothes,
I "I have had a liberal response to the
call for overcoat!," he said, "but we are
out of ahoes and underclothing. We hone '
to get some of this kind of clothing In
so that we csn give it to able-bodied men
so that they ca.i go to work on the Ice.
I hope the people will call us up If they
have anything of this kind."
Many cases of destitution In homes
have been relieved by the Army also.
The hungry, destitute and cold are In the
office of Captain Kline and at the "store"
of the Industrial home at all hours of the
day.
A man was sent out to take bedclothes
to a family whore there was a baby five
weeks old. Ho found the mother In bed
with the Infant shivering. They were
made comfortable. The father la out of
work and sickly.
Cold Too Mac. .
Groceries and provisions were sent to
a mother and four children. The father
is in Arlaona trying to recover from
tuberculosis. The mother has done da
work of all kinds and managed to get
along without asking aid. But the added
burden of buying coal and winter cloth
ing for her little ones proved too much
for her. It aa only aa a last resort
that she asked aid. The charitable In
stitutions bad rover heard of her case
before as she worked unceasingly to try
to carry her burden alone.
Mast Cases Worthy.
"Moat of the cases ar very worthy
ones," said Captain XNne. -."Of -eottrse,
yon 'find a few of th good-for-nothtnga.
I gave an overcoat to a. young fellow one
day and sent him to the ioe for a Job.
Saturday he came back and asked for
another overcoat. He said h had lost
th first one. I fired him out bodily, the
miserable bum. But most of them are
glad to get the work and thankful for th
help.
"We have a great need now for work
or Jobs for men who ere physically unfit
to do the heavy work of harvesting ice.
They are anxious to work, and people
who have jobs around their homes or In
their business places will help by calling
us up so that we can send some of our
men out and let them help themselves
along."
Th Volunteer of America ar helping
a number ot worthy cases and their lodg
ing house has been filled to overflowing
every night sine the cold snap began.
