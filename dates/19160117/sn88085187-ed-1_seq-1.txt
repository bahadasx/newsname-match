This City Must Fight
System Which Keeps

i - Battle Can Be Won
m HIS IS A CALL TO ARMS TO EVERY BUS
K», I INESS MAN IN TACOMA.
■ IT IS A CHANCE FOR THE REORGAN
IZED TACOMA COMMERCIAL CLUB TO DO
r ~ ONE GREAT BIG THING FOR THE CITY
1 RIGHT OFF THE JUMP.
IT IB AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING OUR
* titf. TACOMA PLAYGROUND INTO ITS OWN.
THIS IS THE YEAR OF PROMISE ALSO OF
HARD WORK. AND WE NEED TO GET ON
THE JOB.
,# * *
For years Tacoma and the Northwest have
been "looking out the window" while Califor
nia cities San Francisco, Los Angeles, San
Diego — have been helping themselves to
millions of dollars in real Uncle Sam's coin, half
ty of which belonged to you!
4* * #
Perhaps you didn't know it, but 90 per cept of
•• tourist travfl from the Fast goes to California, not
because (California's climate is better tlian Washing
ton's, not because of finer scenery or better 16COIU
" modations, BUT BECAUSE OF" INFAIK, DIS
CRIMATOST RAILWAY PABSEKGEB RATKS.
It costs the traveler $21.75 more to go from Chi
cago to San Francisco via Tacoma than it does to
San Praucisco via New Orleans, K\ Paso and Los
Angeles! AND THE DISTANCE OVEH THK
' SOUTHK«N ROUTE IS GREATER BY 253
MTLES.
In summer, when special tourist rates are in ef
fect, the difference is $17.00, the preferential favor
ing the Southern route!
That preferential means this:
<J That unless the traveler has relatives liv
ing in the Northwest, or conies here on a matter
of business, he will take the Southern route.
<J That Tacoma hotel men are losing 90 per
cent of their legitimate summer tourist business.
CJ That Puget Sound steamer men are mak
ing just 10 per cent of what they should make
in the summer from tourist patronage.
*I That real estate dealers, street railways,
department stores —in fact every line of busi
ness and every individual business man in this
section of the United States, is losing money
(very year.
With the preferential wiped out, every man who
raters to tourist business in Tacoma could sit down
and multiply his present summer profit by nine!
# # # .
What's the remedy?
Here it is. Get it!
Chairman G. E. Reynolds, of the state public serv
ice commission, has figured it out.
He has filed a complaint in the interest of the peo
pie of this state with the interstate commerce com
mission at Washington, asking that the preferential
be eliminated.
• The complaint is directed against the Southern
Facific, the Union Pacific and the Oregon-Washing
ton Railroad & Navigation Co., alUed lines.
THESE ROADS, OWNED BY THE SAME IN
TERESTS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
_ PREFERENTIAL.

It means money to Taeoma and Washington.
"It is the biggest thing in a financial way that
could be put over for this city and the North
west," says Reynolds.
It is up to Tacoma business men to get togeth
er behind The Times and the rejuvenated Com
mercial club.
The Commercial club, under its old manage
ment, has been ns inactive as the other North
west commercial organizations in fighting this
unfair discrimination. But today it got busy
along with The Times. The, transportation bu

"The transportation situation is in a muddle
today. While it is likely that we cannot succeed
in eliminating the entire amount of the prefer

clear up a number of unfair discriminations in
rates.
"The hands of the Commercial club are not
tied in any way, by contribuationa or otherwise,
and we can sail ahead free to i'ight for the bene
fit of Tacoma."

active.
"We have had the question up with the Seattle
Chamber of Commerce for some time," he Raid.
"The only reason we have not taken any decided
action is because we felt that it would be a losing

The greatest obstacle in the way of wiping out
the preferential he declared to be the necessity
of transfer from the northern to southern roads
in carrying tourists to and from the East.
"The southern roads demand a price for tho
transfer of passengers for purely selfish rea
sons. Tt is a business proposition and perhaps
they cannot be blamed. For they would have to
turn over many more passengers to the northern
roads than the latter could transfer to their lines.
"Yet although it will be an uphill fight 1 be
lieve it will result in lasting benefit to our city."

The interstate commerce commission probably will
take the case in hand about the first of June.
Before that time it is your duty, Mr. Business
Man, to yourself and your pocketbook, to create a
sentiment in favor of an equal round-trip rate over all
roads from Chicago, either way, to San Francisco.
Take the case of Bill Jones and John Smith, gro
cers.
Just suppose the West Coast Co., wholesale gro
cers, should say to Jones:
"We don't like you. So it will cost you 5 cents
a pound more for our coffee than we charge Smith."
How long do you suppose Jones would stand for
that?
He'd beat it over to the Tacoma Grocery Co. or
some other wholesale firm, wouldn't he?
YET THE BUSINESS MEN OF TACOMA, IN
SPITE OF THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
THEM, HAVE PATRONIZED THE 0.-W. LINE
TO THE EXTENT OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
