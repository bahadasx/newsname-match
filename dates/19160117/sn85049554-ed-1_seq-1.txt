the state that attorneys representing

the case of the city of Des Moines
against the Iowa Telephone Company,
if the supreme court consents to re
open the litigation.
The supreme court recently handed
down a decision holding that the Iowa
company had a perpetual franchise to
operate in Des Moines. H| W. Byers,
corporation counsel, declaring that the
Iowa supreme court had disregarded
every rule that it had previously recog
nized, asked for a re-hearing and the
court set today as the time on which
it would determine the motion.
Mr. Byers filed written arguments In
which he made the following state

"Just how a conclusion, that takes
from a large number of cities of Iowa

satisfactory to the people living In such
cities and towns and it ought not to be

In commenting upon the court's
cent decision in fovar of the telephone
company, Mr. Byers said:
"We do not hesitate to say that this
ruling violates almost every rule that
this court has recognized in the past
when interpreting statutes granting
special rights and privileges. It will
not. do to say that the extent of the

City Frequently Visited by Disas

Christlanla, Norway, Jan. 17.—Two
thousand citizens of the picturesque
Norwegian seaport of Bergen are
homeless as a result of a $15,000,000 fire
which destroyed a third of the city
Saturday night.
Bergen is a city of 90,000.
The conflagration is said to be the
worst ever recorded in Norway. The
business section, with its old wholesale
houses, several of the largest of the ho
tels, a number of schools, the electric
plans, and banks and newspaper build
ings, was the part burned.
Hurrioane Fan* Flames.
The fire started Saturday evening in
an Ironmonger's shop, and, fanned by
a hurricane, the flames spread rapidly
and soon enveloped all the business
portion.
The firemen endeavored to circum
scribe the area of the tire, but their
task was hopeless. In order to prevent
a further spread of the conflagration,
they finally blew up buildings on the
outer edge of the path of the flames.
Late reports say that no lives were
lost.
Much Provisions Burned.
The difficulties of the 2,000 persons
now without, homes were increased by
the fact that the largest storage houses
filled-with provisions for supplying the
surrounding country, were burned
down. It Is harder to obtain groceries
today than at any time since the out
break of the war.
Bergen never was so flourishing as
at the beginning of the. present year,
these conditions being due largely to
the increase^ mierchant marine. It is
bite of the oldest and most picturesque
-towns ln Norway, and It ranks^ first of.
the Norwegian ship owning centers.
Has Had Three Big Fires.
Bergen is well built on a hilly penin
sula and is situated at the end of a
deep bay of the Atlantic, .190 miles
northwest of Christiana. Thru Bergen
passes a large part of the foreign trade
of Norway. Fleets of vessels bring the
product of the northern fisheries to the
seaport.
Bergen has repeatedly suffered from
fire,(as in 1702 and. 1855, and the broad
open spaces which Interrupt the streets
are intended as a safeguard against
the spread of flames.
Many of the houses still are timber
built and painted' white. The chief
buildings of the city are the National
museum, a large public library, the ca
thedral, and a marine biological sta
tion.

The Hague, via London, Jan. 17.—
•Dr. Charles F. Aked, Mme. Roslka
Schwlmmpr, and other members of the
Ford peaqe board, after having vainly
appealed to the German minister at
The.-Hague for permission for the
Scandinavian peace delegates to return
home thru Germany, telegraphed Sun
day to Berlin for the desired permits.
Recent efforts of members of the Ford
party to cross Germany have been
blocked by the German military au
thorities, with the explanation that the
delegates are undesirable.
Twenty-five subjects of Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway who came here
with the peace expedition are desirous
to return to' their homes, which they
are unable to go-unless by way of the
North sea. This route ls regarded un
safe. Included ln those marooned here
Is Patil Lyundhagen, mayor of Stock

Mme. Schwlmmer, who is a Hungar
