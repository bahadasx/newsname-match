"Recent. lpcaT siiccemes-obtained by
the British on the Somme are heralded
by the British press &• great victories,"
says ,the newe agency. "Nevertheless
the British were enabled to make this
advance only a{ter eleven weeks of l£ie
most desperate effort. The result of the
battle of the Somme should be gaged by
considering, the amount of Belgian and
French territory held-by the Germans.
Of this territoryV'28,000 kilometers Is
Belgian and 21,000 French. The efTorts
made by the French a'nd British have
resulted in the reconquest of only 1,500
square kilometers, or only 3 per cent.
"The price ipa'd for this territory is
appalling.' According to a conservative
estimate the British lost 350,000 men up
to Sept. 15. This, together with the
French losses, brings up the total to
about a half nttllion men."

given out at the allied' 'capitals and
from stories sent-out from Athens. The
number of soldiers transported to Ger
many, according'to these versions, was
lees than 1,000,'one account' placing the
total at-seventy officers and 800 men.
The remainder of the garrison is vari
ously said to have been transported to
Saloniki by the French and to be en
camped on the Island Thasos. ££cent

General Trevino Driven From Chihua

Villistaa But Suecaaded in Dialodging
Attackers by Gaining Hill With Ar

Haa Been Taken in Second Assault
San Antonio, Tex., Sept.
20.—Belief
that Francisco Villa will soon cut the
Carranza line of communication be
tween Chihuahua City and Juarez, if
he has not already done so. was sug
gested by Major General Funston to
day after he had. read a report on the
Villa Chihuahua engagement, sub
mitted from General Bell.
Stories gathered by General Bell
from persons reaching Kl Paso' from
the Interior indicate that General
Trevlno's forces were driven out of
Chihuahua City in Villa's Saturday
attack and that they took stations on
a large hill outside the city, from
necessity and not from choice, as pre
vious reports said.
From this hill they succeeded by
use of artillery in dislodging the Vil
listaa.
General Funston refused to give out
the details of the report but he said it
confirmed previous accounts o£ the
battle and the situation as reported
was even more serious than reported
by the Carranzistas.
General Funston believes the Villlsta
force has grown since the Chihuahua
battle. He said that in this case the
logical step for Villa to take would be
the severing of the line of communica
tion between Chihuahua and Juarez.
This would give him control of the
Mexican Northwestern railroad.

Chicago, Sept. SO.—A word about the
so-oalled eight-hour law as related to
railroad operatives by William J.
Stone, United States senator from Mis.
sourl, was issued by the western na
tional democratic headquarters bere
today. Accompanying the statement
was
a word that Mr. Stone was repre
senting the thought of the administra
tion on the subjeot. Tho statement
said in part:
"Messrs. Hughes^ Roosevelt, Root,
Lodge. Penrose^ Payne, Plerpont Mor
gan, George W. Perkins and that en
tire genua maintain that the president
and congress surrendered to force, and
thereby discredited, publlo authority
and weakened the foundations of our
governmental Institution.
"One weakness about this charge is
that It is false. Nobody threatened
the president or congress nobody de
manded anything of them. There was
no controversy between the govern
ment and the railroad employes, nor
between the government and the man
agers. The controversy was purely
industrial, waged between several bun.
dred thousand men who operate trains
on one hand and the men who man
age the roads on the other."
The senator point* out the etfeot
fruit growers, feeders of five stock,
Asserting that the democrats would
show that the president placed before
congress a complete program to meet
the threatened railroad strike, Mr. Mc
Cormlck asserted that Mr, Wilson is
prepared to urge strongly the enact
ment of this program.
The republicans, he declared, seemed
to Ignore everything in the program
except the one Item passed by con
gress. He said it would be shown how
the president planned to minimise a
possibility of the repetition of the
strike situation.
"HOUR LAW UNPARDONABLE."

peaceful settlement of grievances and
a careful examination and open
