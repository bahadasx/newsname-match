RELATESIFACTS
Pertaining'To the Public
Institutions
of DisTtncr OF
How He Has Worked For Saving
Money Regardless Of
Religious Faith. :&$
WORTH ATTENTION' OF VOTERS
A large crowd greeted Congress
man Ben Johnson at Ills announced
speaking here Monday. He was
Introduced by Mr. 0. B. Likens, who
very njtly remarked that Mr. John
son needed no, Introduction to an
Ohio county audience.
Mr. Johnson said he was pleased
to see such a representative audi
ence p'resent. Said his greatest am-
tJtlonJstp represent the sentiment
and wishes of the people forming
his constituency, regardless of po
litical affiliation. Taxation, said Mr.
Johnson, Js one of the most impor
tant questions of the day, as it af
fects everybody. There are two
main taxes ono to secure life and
the other property. Liberty is al
ready assured. The great money
interests are sure to see that they
aro not overtaxed. They always
have representatives present to see
to this. The people also have their
guardians in the person of their
representative in Congress. Mr.
Johnson said that In this he has nl
wnys tried fodo his whole duty.
Adverting to national politics,
"Mr. Johnson said that every promise
made by Democrats had been ful
filled. Hughes' eternal criticism of
President Wilson has brought the
Ropublican Presidential candidate
much ridicule. If Wilson is wrons
In his policy, then the opposite of
lii?y.cUons must be the standpoint
of Candidate Hughes, but the latter
will not take a definite position. No
persuasion can get Candidate Hughes
to (specific In Just what he would
do or would have done If ho were
in President Wilson's place.
The recont State election In
Elaine, said Mr. Johnson, offers no
discouraging features to Democrats.
A careful estimate has been made
and the Democrats got 33 per cent,
more votes this time than they did
four years ago and the Republicans
only 4 per cent, 'I his ratio carried
out In the nation would re-elect
President Wilson by an enormous
majority. Tho nomination of Chief
Justico Hughes was gladly acclaimed
hy Wall Street and stocks and bonds
ro?u several points. At the same
time and place a declluo In prices of
farm products was announced, show
ing whoso Interests wero being fa
vored. '
Ono of the greatest strokes of
statesmanship ever made, said Mr.
Johnson, was when President Wilson
by" UH quick and timely action pro-,
vented the threatened railroad,
strike, which would have stagnated .
every avenue of business and. caused
much hunger and wuut throughout,
tho country. Ono of the most bo-
nevolent net Congress ever did was
to support President Wilson in, his
stand. Mr. Johnson told of tho
great benefits of Democratic legisla
tion in Congress. Many relief meas
ures wero passed which had been
neglected by the Republicans' for
years. Among these were tho Child
Labor law, the Good Roads law, tho
Rural Credits lnw.and mauy others.
Would tho Republicans repeal any
of them? Ask any leudlngjtepub
McM'. Asking the indulgence of his au(
dlcnco for a lew minutes. Mr. John,
non very modestly and brlelly told
of Ji'own work In Congress. Of
money wrongfully collected, all told
Mr. Johnson has, had turned Into
-tho Treasury of the United Btates
more than two millions of dollars.
These acts covered a porlod of years
and reprpseut various su;ns from
different Quarters -which were stated
ly Mr, Johnson, At numerous times
during Mr. Johnson's speech he was
heartily npplauded.
Along at tho close of his speech
Mr. Johnson referred to the attack
recently made upon him, through
the columns of the Hartford Repub
lican, by Mr. James H. Williams, of
Ilnrlford, and who claims to bo u
Democrat. The fact that Mr. John
sen in a Catholic In religious belief
is evidently the basis of these at
tacks. Mr. Johnson said that never
before In n public speech had ho dis
cussed the nintter of religious be
liefs or the attacks niad'o upon his
religious convictions, nnd ho only
did so now because ho had been as
sailed through public print. He as
serted very -posltlvoly that the Cath
olic Church was against the mixture
of affairs of Church and State. A
short while before the speaking com
menced Mr. Johnson went over to
the drug store of Mr. Williams and
Invited that gentleman to come up
to the court house at 1:30 o'clock
and hear his (Johnson's) speech;
that he (Johnson) would answer ev
ery question Mr. Williams had asked
or any others he cared to add to tho
list. Mr. Williams declined to come
fo the speaking on the excuse of
lack of time. Mr. Williams had In
timated In his charges that Con
gressman Johnson had discriminated
between tho Catholic and non-Catholic
Churches lnHis actsjof recover
Ing money wrongfully appropriated
to public Institutions. The sub
stance of what Mr. Johnson said on.
this subject and his views in the
matter are contained in what fol
lows: Most
municipalities have their
own public hospitals and orphan asy
lums. There is not now and never
has been any such institution In the
District of Columbia. .
About twelve years ago the
trlct of Columbia bought a tract of
land containing about fourteen acres'

in the District or Columbia who were'
not able to pay their expenses in pay
institutions. -
Eacli and every one of the charl-
table Institutions In the District of
Columbia whether they be Catholic
or non-Catholic has a part of the
building- setj off for charitable Pa-,
tlents. Those who are not able to
pay are Uiken to 'those .respective
charitable wards and tho board and

Tho local authorities have found
it to be cheaper to pay for the caro
of their pauper sick In other institu
tions than In one owned by tho mu
nicipality. In consequence a build
ing has never been erected upon tho
lot of ground which was acquired
for that purpose nbput "twelve ycarg

that they will have to employ offi

nurses will liuvo to bo paid all the
year around whether the number of
inmates be great or small. Under
tho piesent arrangement they
do not havo to pay
theso over-head charges. In
stead, tho Commissioners of the Dis
trict of Columbia make contracts
with tho various hospital, ln the

these pauper patients that coiitiact

Mr. Williams nro correct or not. It
Is singular, however, that ho takes
the position that the food, clothing

institutions to pauper patients should
not bo paid for, and tlmt the same
service rendered by. non-Catholic In
stitutions' should bo paid for.
'Among the non-Catbpllo hospitals
in the District of Columbia which
have been paid on tho same basis as
the Catholic institutions have been
paid, are the Casualty, the Colum

dently did not tell him that while
Congress did appropriate the money
for the expenses enumerated by him,
yet the money so appropriated was
not out of the Treasury of the Unit

longing to the District of Columbia.
The District of Columbia, lias no
Treasurer. That ofilco was abolish
ed by a Republican Congress lu
1874. Since that time all tho taxes
and other revenues collected by tho
District of Columbia are deposited
in the Treasury of the United States
to tho credit of tho District of Co
lumbia, and, under the law, can not
be paid out except Congress author
ize it to bo done through appropria
tion bills.
Since 1S7S the people throughout
the United States ,havo been com
pelled to pay one-half of all tho ex
penses of the District of Columbia.
The hospital expenses about which
Mr. Williams has so Iguorniitly writ
ten, are also paid on that half-and-half
basis.
Since 1 huvt been" In Congress It
has been my main effort to relievo
tho people In Kentucky and tho oth-
Catholic hospitals In tho District of
Columbia have annually paid to
tliem one-half of those expenses
which are contributed by tho people
of Kentucky and lu thu other States,

It follows as a natural conscquenco
that my light has boon to relieve tho
people throughout tho Union from
paying anything to either tho Cath
olic hospitals or to tho liou-Cathollo
hospitals. My policy bus bojii to
treat all those Institutions just alike.
I am not lu favor of having the
people in Kentucky taxed to take
caro of the poor people In tho Dis
trict of Columbia, when tho people
ln the District of Columbia are
abundantly and amply able to take
caro of their own poor.
There I another thing wbjan. no

and of which his bigoted Informant
