GREECE NEAR
WAR; TEUTON
MOVE CAUSE
Believed Athens Has Al
ready Sent Ultimatum to
Germany and Bulgaria.
RESENT 'GUEST' IDEA
Demand for Release of 20,
000 Greek Troops Taken
From Port of Kavala
London. Sept. 20 (4:20 p. in.)
Renters Telegram company says
it learns Uiat the Grwk govern
ment has submitted a very urgent
note to Germany regarding the re
moval to Germany of Greek troops
from Kavala and demanding- that
they be released.
Athens. Tuesday, Sept. 19, 12:30
p. m.. (via London, Sept. 20, li':20
p. m Delayed.) There Is reason
to believe that the Greek govern
ment has sent an ultimatum to
Germany and Bulgaria, expiring
Wednesday night, demanding the
immediate return of the soldiers
taken prisoner at Kavala.
When the Greek seaport of Kavala
was entered by German and Bulgarian
troops the city was garrisoned by the
Fourth Greek army corps. According
to an official statement issued by Ber
lin, the entire corps, consisting of
20.000 men, asked the German com
mander for food and shelter and pro
tection against the entente forces. The
statement said that to prevent any
breach of neutrality the Greek soldiers
would be transported to Germany, to
be kept there as guests of the nation.
The German account of the affair
differs radically from that glv-ejv-out
at the allied capitals and from stories
pent out from Athens. The number of
soldiers transported to Germany, ac
cording to these versions, was less
than a thousand, one account placing
the total at 70 officers and Sou men.
The remainder of the garrison is var
iously said to have been transported to
Saloniki by the French authorities and
to be encamped on the island of Tha
eos. The second dispatch from Athens
reported the arrival of some members
of the Kavala garrison in the Greek
capital, but no numbers were given.
, Caused Sensation in Greece.
The incident caused a profound sen
sation in Greece and the action of the
Germans was bitterly denounced by
the pro-ally party. Immediately after
Frernier Kalogeropoulos took office,
Athens dispatches said, he intended to
demand the return of the Greek sol
diers from Germany, and that refus
al of this demand would be the signal
for the entry into the war of Greece
on the side of the entente.

Berlin., Pepr. 13, via London, Sept.
10, 1:2:, a. in. (Delayed.) -- Major
K'rnst Fassermann, leader of the ,'a
tional Liberal party, in a keynote
speech delivered on Monday before his
ronst.it utents in the Saarbruecken dis

campaign bad been postponed and
abandoned. Major lUssermann advo
cated the wiriest use of both subma

The liberal leader asserted that his
views were shared by Admiral von
Tirpitz, Admiral von Koester. Prince
von Fuejow and fount Zeppelin. He
maintained that "in a Ftrugple where
in the existence of Germany is at
stake the most ruthless use of all posl
Bible weapons is (ailed for." This
sentiment was heartily applauded by
his audience. Submarines and Zep

were the most effective weapon against
"our arch enemy, England."
Referring to the I'nited States,
Major Fassermann warned his hearers
gaitst trusting for any permanent ef
fect upon American sympathies from
England's black list policy and the
achievements of the Deutschland and
other commercial submarines. He
earned them, also, not to hope that
the present American protests to Kng
land would have any greater c fleet
than their predecessors.
No prospects of peace were held out
ty the speaker. He told his hearers
that it would be a delusion to believe
that there was any immediate prospect
f an end to the war. On the con
trary, he said, Germany was facing a
Biore difficult war than at first ap

WILSON IN FOR
FOR GREAT WORK
President Has 'ew Tlan for An Effec
tive Campaign On the Demo
cratic Side.
Long Pranch. N. J., Sept. 20. Presi
dent Wilson swung into campaign
form today. With his plan for discus
sing public questions before non-partisan
organizations, instead of making
campaign tours, fully decided upon,
he actively took up his political plans.
Administration leaders here predict
that, from now on, there will be plenty
of activity in the democratic campaign.
The attacks of Charles E. Hughes will
be fully met. fhey say. by the presi
dent himself and by members of his
cabinet and democratic leaders who
will tour the country.
Vance C. McCormick, the chairman
of the democratic national committee,
held an early conference with the
president this morning before leaving
for New York. He will return In a
few days to make arrangements for
the speeches to be made by Mr. Wil
son. Meantime the president worked on
a speech he will make to a delegation
of business men he will receive Sat
urday, and on the address he will de
liver Monday before the convention of
the National Grain Dealers' associa
tion. In these two speeches he will
outline the reason why he thinks far
mers and business men should vote
the democratic ticket.
President Wilson and Vance C. Mc
Cormick have mapped out a program
for meeting the campaign attacks of
Mr. Hughes on the railroad eight-hour
law.
Asserting that the democrats would
show that the president placed before
congress a complete program to meet
the recently threatened strike by the
railway employes, Mr. McCormick said
that Mr. Wilson is prepared to urge
strongly during the next session of
congress the enactment of this pro
gram. When the entire plan of the presi
dent is fully understood, the people of
the country will join in praising Mr.
Wilson, the chairman asserted. The
republicans, he declared, seem to ig
nore everything in the program except
the one item passed by congress. Mr.
McCormick added that it would be
shown clearly how the president plans
to minimize the possibility of a repe
tition of the railroad situation which
arose recently.

8-HOUR LAW
DEFENDED BY
U.S.SENATQR
Stone of Missouri Shows Up
Weakness of Hughes At
tacks on President.
ARE AIMED AT LABOR
Attitude of Wilson in Threat
ened Rail Strike Fine Act
of Statesmanship.
Chicago, Sept. 20. "A word
about the so-called eight-hour
law as related to railroad operat
ives," by William J. Stone, Uni
ted States senator from Missouri,
was issued by the western nation
al democratic headquarters today.
Accompanying the statement was
an assertion that Senator Stone
was representing the thought of
the administration on the subject.
The statement said in part:
"Messrs. Hughes, Roosevelt, Root,
Lodge, Penrose, Crane, Pierpont Mor
gan, George W. Perkins and that en
tire genus, maintain that the presi
dent and congress surrendered to
force and thereby discredited public
authority and weakened the founda
tions of our governmental institution.
"One weakness about this charge is
that it is false. No body threatened
the president or congress; nobody de
manded anything of them. There was
no controversy between the govern
ment and the railroad employes, nor
between the government and the rail
road managements. The controversy
was purely industrial.
"The trouble had reached a point so
acute that these hundreds of thou
sands of men were on .the verge .at.
strike; they were about
and thus leave the entire railroad
trononnptatiAn ff tha pAiintftf i i f, I nr.
for an indefinite period.
The statement then1 points out that
while the crisis existed, senators and
representatives and members of the
administration were receiving com
munications from all parts of the
country indicating that "the public
sentiment almost universally favored
any reasonable means of averting this
catastrophe."
What President Averted.
The senator pointed out the possible
effects of a strike on the fruit growers
of the far west, on feeders of livestock,
farmers shipping grain on contracts;
manufacturers of steel and textiles
under contract to be shipped; on the
fuel supply of the country and on the
mining and timber industries and their
allied interests and dependents.
"These are the things the president
faced and such the calamity he brave
ly, patiently, patriotically sought to
avert," Senator Stone continued. "Who
blames him? Mr. Hughes says he
should have investigated the questions
at issue before acting. They seem to
think that although the house was on
fire, the president should have In
quired into the cause of the fire before
putting it out, instead of first putting
it out and then investigating the cause.
"I can understand this argument
when made by men like J. Pierpont
Morgan, George W. Perkins and others
of that type, but I am amazed that
Justice Hughes should adopt it. I am
amazed that he would ally himself
with Mr. Morgan multimillionaire
prince of Wall street, maker and
wrecker of railroads, lord of the Brit
ish exchequer in America.
"Is that really the issue Mr. Hughes
i presents to the judgment of the Amer
ican people?" for myself I proclaim
this achievement, considered in its im
mediate and patent blessings, as one
of the greatest in the history of the re
public. Hughes Is Hard Driven.
"Mr. Hughes, hard driven, is appeal
ing to powerful special interests. I
am sorry to behold this spectacle in
our public life.
"I would turn from Morgan. Per
kins, Roosevelt, Root, Lodge, Penrose
and all such of these who preach these
Strang doctrines, and ask the great
masses of the people whether the
president was right. Moreover, when
powerful, opulent, sinister, special in
terests assail the president because of
this fine act of Christian statesman
ship, I would ask the working men,
who with the president must bear the
brunt of these attacks, for they are
aimed at the great army of labor In
this country, what answer they will
make."
