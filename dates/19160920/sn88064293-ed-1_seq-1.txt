MY
.WHERE
ARE
Manager Loeb of the Evangeline
Theatre put over a big program
last night with his exhibition of
that famous film play entitled,
"Where Are My Children?'* The
picture was a powerful presentation
of a theme that should, perhaps, be
carefully thought of by everyone
and the manner in which the thought
and object were presented was for
cible, yet in a quiet, dignified por
trayal. The picture showed to
packed houses here last night and
the afternoon shows were well at
tended.
LIVING MODELS FOR FALL
OPENING OCTOBER 10TH
At least one merchant in Morgan
City is determined to utilize the
big opportunity that will be present
ed to his business on October 10th,
when the Municipal Fall Opening
and Style Show will be held here.
Living, breathing, beaming models,
secured from the leading social
ranks of the city will lend their as
sistance to the style demonstration
to be made by the firm who has an
nounced its intention to present
their coats, coat suits, dresses and
millinery in this modern manner,
The young ladies of the city are
entering into the spirit of the com
ing style show and a number have
volunteered to add to the success of
the occasion by donning the dresses,
etc., and giving the visitors a chance
to study the garments as they will
actually appear when worn by the
purchaser.
This living model demonstration
is new to Morgan City but it has
been wonderfully successful in many
other cities. Now that the first at
tempt at this method of demonstrat
ing new goods is to be made, there
is a cheering response on the part
of both merchants and citizens to
■nter into the show with a zest and
an appreciation of its advantages
to both style shops and the shoppers
