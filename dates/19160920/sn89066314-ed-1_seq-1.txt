Spirit of Brotherhood"
Scholarships Awarded.
Despite financial and other obstacles
the University of Missouri has grown
in its enrollment to the extent of 500
students yearly for the last two years,
A. Koss Hill, president of the Univer
sity, declared this morning in his
talk before the opening convocation
of the school ear. Many thought that
the University would not open this
fall, he said, but despite these rumors
the first days of the school year have
shown a substantial Increase in at
tendance. President Hill also commented up
sn the dignity of the opening of the
University and the absence of hazing.
He spoke of the friendly 'feeling of
brotherhood and co-operation which
Is being fostered by the absence of
rough play between the two under
classes.
Announcements were made of the
awards of the Rhodes Clay scholar
ship in the College of Arts and
Science and the Kahn scholarship in
the School of Law. The first award
which is given for excellence in scho
lastic ability during the freshman
year in the College of Arts and Science
was made to Miss Lena Ruddy of

lumbia. The Margaret McClure
scholarship given by the Margaret
McClure chapter of the United Daugh
ters of the Confederacy. St Louis,

of Hannibal, Mo. A scholarship
given by the Robert E. Lee chapter
of the U. D. C. Kansas City, has been
awarded to Cannon C. Hearne of Neo
sho, Mo., a sophomore in the College
of Agriculture.
President Hill told of the Improve
ments in the various divisions of the
University which hare been made this
year of the faculty changes. The
School of Commerce will have a wider
curriculum, a course of agricultural
engineering is to be added to the Col
lege of Agriculture and the student
health department of the University
Is to be strengthened. He also spoke
of the addition of one United States
infantry officer to the military depart
ment and the work of the twenty Uni
versity of Missouri men who are at th
border with the national guard.
"What has been done in regard to
the abolition of the practice of hazing
Ig an Indication of the growth of the
spirit of 'brotherhood among the stu
dents of the University." President
Hill said in closing. "The further
expression of this spirit has been
made In the student union movement
I have been at a loss to meet the stu
dents of the University for I see them
only In small units and not as a
whole. I will welcome the union
building as a place where I can drop
in and meet the students upon the
same plane and talk over their plans
with them as man- to man. The board
of directors of the union will meet
Saturday morning to obtain a home
for the union for this year. We hope
in the future to emulate Michigan in
her building plan."
The opening prayer and closing
benediction of the convocation were
made by the Rev. Ben-Ezra Stiles Ely,
Jr.. pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Hannibal, Mo. The assem
bly sang Missouri and America.

Mexican Officials Angered at
Trevino's Failure to Guard
Against Attack.
By United Press.
EL PASO, Sept. 20. All Mexico to
day awaited word of another Villista
attack on Chihuahua City.
While a, message was coming in to
Juarez late last night from Chihuahua
City that shots were heard outside
the city and it was feared Villistas
were making another attack, com
munication failed -and had not been
resumed at noon.
Carranzista officials refuse to give
credence to another attack, saying
the message probably referred to the
firing Tuesday morning by excited
outposts.
Harsh criticism of General Tre
vino's failure to take precautions
against an attack are being directed
at the commander by Carranza of
ficials on the border. One high de
facto official declared this afternoon
that Trevino is either a Villista or a
coward.
It is believed that Carranza will
again attempt to depose Trevino from
command at Chihuahua. Twice be
fore Trevino has refused to turn over
his command to another when order
ed to do so, and ignored all orders
from Mexico City.

A definite program for the withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico and

other story Is that the commission will
suggest a withdrawal as soon as pos
sible, but that Washington will not
acquiesce in this plan immediately.
The commission held no formal ses
sion today.

Less Than 3-Day Total
Last Year.
NEW PLAN A
SUCCESS
4
Freshmen Hear Student
Government Explained In
Y.M.C.A. Auditorium
The total enrollment for the three
days of regular registration was 2,422
at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon. This
summer is thirty-four less than the
total number enrolling during the
first three days of registration last
year. It was expected that last
year's record would be bettered by
the time the doors closed this after
noon. The total of 2,456 enrolling
during the first three days last jcar
was the best record In the history of
the University of Missouri.
Of the 2,422 that had enrolled up
to 3:30 o'clock this aftesnoon 1,500
were enrolled the first two hours Mon
day morning. This was due to the
new method"of advance registration
instituted by Registrar Frank Cham
bers this year whereby the student
registered by mail and found his study
card ready for him Immediately upon
payment of his fees.
As a result of the new sjstem, only
150 enrolled today in comparison to
552 the final day last year, proving
the success of the new method in
hastening registration and removing
the congestion occurring on the final
day In past years.
"We are doing everything possible
to make the task of enrolling lighter
for the students," said Mr. Chambers
this afternoon. "And hope to soon
eliminate all delays due to the large"
number of students."
The three days allotted for registra
tion ended at 5 o'clock this afternoon.
A large number are expected to entet
during the remaining days this wejk.
Over 150 freshmen gathered In the
Y. M. C. A. auditorium last evening
to hear an explanation of the student
government system and learn what
they can and cannot do during the
coming nine months.
Short talks were made by President
A. Ross Hill and Sam Bratton, repre
senting the Student Council. The
meeting was presided over by Student
President L. C- .Lozier.

THE "COLLEGE BLUES;" HAS'
YOUR FRESHMAN HAD 'EM?
The 'College Blues," a new disease,
has made its appearance in Columbia
witli the coming of the "freshmen."
Aspliah Gamble of Oklahoma City
Is the first victim. Asphah succumb
ed to It and Is now speeding home
ward, where she should recover short
ly after her arrival.
During the first day that she was in
Columbia, Uncle Sam's business to
Oklahoma City took a decided in
crpase. Far away from mother, home
ant! friends, she had a lots to tell ot
fie strange and Interesting sights
here; the columns, the Hinkson and
Lover's Leap, and the Interesting life
of the University student.
The days of registration approached.
By this time the meals began to lose
their taste; the newness of the Univer
sity life began to fade. She began to
long for those home-made biscuits
in the morning and mother-made
bread for lunch. She began to long
for that spick and span dining room
SHOE FACTORY STILL
OSESMENT HELP
M. U. Men Continue in
Office Work at the Ham- .
ilton-Brown PlantT
CAN'T RUN MACHINES
Efficiency of Shop is Lessen
ed If Men Are Employ
ed For Part Time.
Although 'the Hamilton-Brown Shoe
Factory of Columbia Is not employing
much student labor this year, there
are a few students working in the
factory office and, according to Walter
H. Braselton, the new superintendent,
students will continue to work at the
factory in positions where the hiring
of students does not Interfere with
the efficiency of the working system.
According to Braselton, during the
summer there were four students
working In the factory, and now there
are three, and the student missing
from the payroll has obtained a better
position in one of the University of
.flces. "We are doing all in our power to
help the students In the University and
the town boys in school, so long as
It does not hurt the efficiency of the
factor." said Walter H. Braselton,
local manager of the factory this
morning. "Everywhere I can use a
student to advantage, I am doing so,
and will continue to do so. I have
one Univeristy student In our employ
ho can work one-half day, and eart
his money, and at the same time he
does not Interfere with the other oij
ganlzatlon of "the office.
Students Work Part Time.
"The drawback to hiring student
help lies in the fact that the student
works only a part of each day, and
then some one else must take his
place. It takes us four months to
instruct an employe in the work of
the .factory and by this time the stu-
dent Is Teady to leave. Generally, he
does nfct wish to learn the trade, but
merely to work a few months in the
factory.
1 "Our payroll is about $3,400 a week.
and it has always been my aim to
pay the highest wages possible to get
efficient work instead of hiring the
greatest number of workers.
"We have 347 people on the pay
roll and our work Is done in a chain.
We have a duplicate machine for every
one used. These extra machines are
always under steam, so if one gets out
of order the employe can step to the
other one, and the work is not hung
up. So you see that it is a matter of
efficiency for the company and this
factory, that our help must be steady.
For this reason we cannot hire stu
dents in the factory proper. We are
hiring as many as we can use in the
office."
Braselton Here a Short Time.
Mr. Braselton has been here but a'
few months, coming to the Columbia
factory because of the educational
benefits of the city. He says he is al
ways ready to show the citizens of
the town through the factory, and is
desirous of the city knowing that
there is one of the largest factories
in the state m this city. The present
output is 1,800 pair a day, but Manager
Braselton expects to increase this to
2,400 pair in a short time.
In speaking of the present health
with Its table flooded with good things
to eat
Then Asphah got the "college
blues." Her girl friends tried to help
her scare them away, but the malady
increased until it was a real case of
homesickness.
She had not even registered but
was ready to give up and go back to
her home in the western city. She
wrote home and a special delivery
letter came as a reply. That night, a
happy girl excitedly repacked the
many new things she had unpacked a
few days before. Today the "Katy"
train bound for-the southwest had as
one of Its passengers, a bright-eyed,
happy girl.
Once this girl had a desire to go to
college, but that desire has now faded
away. She was yearning for the train
to increase its speed and before the
sun goes up again, she will leave the
train at Oklahoma City and run to the
arms of a waiting mother. (Perhaps
she will return when the "college
blues" are cured.
