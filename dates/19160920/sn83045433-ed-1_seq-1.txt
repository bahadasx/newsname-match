end has already been set in motion.

men, developed here today.

the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen,
scattered all over the country:
"Surely it is the duty of not only our
own members. but all persons who work
for a living, to support our friends, nd.
if possible, defeat our enemies at the
coming election.
"Therefore, it is urgently requested that
the position taken by President Wilson
and both branches of Congress be not
forgotten and that all members use every
honorable means to reta:n in office, re
Aardless of partisan beliefs, those who
have proven their loyalty to the cause
