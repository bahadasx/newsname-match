leaders paved the way lor the creation
of a New England tarm and business
union. It remains for this union to
Intensely study the fanning handicaps
which have been discussed at the con
ference and to put Into effect the
remedies which were proposed.
Wilson II. Lee of New Haven, Conn
who presided Saturday, was authoriz
ed to appoint a committee of 50 to de
vise ways of financing the work the
farm and business union will do, and
another committee of 15 to perfect
the union's organization. The primar
objects to the motion, which concltid
ed a two-day union will be to see that
tanners can obtain credit on the same
basis as business men, so they may
build up their farms; that they an
given co-operative facilities for liar
vesting their crops and Ihe best pos
sible facilities for getting their milk
their garden produce and their field
crops to the consumers. The deliniu
formation of the union, which will
probably be headed by the bestknown
New England men. w ill develop within
the next few weeks. The two day con
ference with Its developments was
held at the Instance of the Eastern
States exposition, whose grounds In

MOTOR FORTS MADE IN AMERICA
Machines From Peoria, III., Hurdle
German Trenches.
Washington, Sept. 18. The British
"tanks" the armored motor cars used
in recent assaults on German trenches
in northern France so successfully as
to attract world-wide attention, were
built for the most part in Peoria. Ill
in the form of caterpillar tractors de
signed to meet some of the difficult
problems of modern farming. Except
tor their armor, their machine guns
uid their crews, thousands are in use
today in the I'nited States in labor
less heroic occupation than war.
H. H. Baker, vice president of the
Holt Manufacturing company, explain
ii here today that it was machines
made by his company at Peoria that
had hurdled German trenches, walked
through forests and crawled over shell
raters in the face of Intense gunfire
We have sold about 1,000 caterpll
lar tractors to the Hrllisii govern
nient." he said. "Some of our men at
yderehot, England, recently were
notified that the British intended to
trm some of the trai tors and use them
or work oilier than the usual towing
ut big guns.
'Germany had some of these tract
ors before the war began. We have
sent some to France and some to Rus
sia. So far as I know up until their
recent appearance the trnctors were
used only to tow big guns. I under
stood that Germany used about Pi in
this work before Liege and recent
photographs show that the British are
using some of them now for the same
iiirposi .
These tractors can go ahead over
ilmost anything or through almost
anything. They can straddle a trench
go through a swamp, roll over logs,
or climb thiough shell craters like a
car of Juggernaut. B looks uncanny
to see them crawl along the ground
Just like a huge catterplllar."
Mr. Baker said the tractors sent to
England weigh about ls.noo pounds
if h. develop 12' horse power and are
built of steel. The tractor crawls on
wo belts, or steel rails, in short sec
tions, operating over a cogged meeh-
misni that actually lays them down
with their belt attachment as the trac
tor moves ahead and picks them up
main to that the car runs on its own
self made track continuously.
In the ordinary tractor about seven
feet of belt and rails hug the ground.
Mr. Baker said that the machine
would bridge any trench noi wider
than the length of track it laid on the
ground nt one time. The '-'bow"
might hit the far side of the trench
far below Ihe top and the "stern" DA-
lOUDtedly would sink a little, but the
tenacity of the tractor, he declared.
would enable it to climb out. He sou
(feted that the British probably had
ngthened the track giving the trac
tors greater power to surmount ob
stacle,'. It Is understood the I'nited State;
war department Is experimenting with
armored tractors somewhat like those
now In use on the British battle line.
London, Sept. IS. Credit for the

Another Change Made After Some

OUTSIDE PUPILS MUST WAIT
They Will Have Their Lessons Sent
By Mail For the First Week of ..
School.
The public schools of the town and
village of Bennington will reopen next
Monday morning after a delay of three
weeks. Pownal and Woodford schools
are to open at the same time.
Chairman ferry, of the school board
and Supt. Yarney were ill consultation
Tuesday afternoon with the local
board of health which had been given

seemed best.
There was some variance of opinion
but it was finally decided to open the
schools next Monday, but to not per
mit, for the first week anyway, pupils
to enter except from the town of Ben
nington. Pupils living in other towns
will have their lessons sent to them by
mail so that they may keep up with
their class.
If there are no new cases of paralysis
it is probable that the outside pupils
can be admitted after next week.
There have been no cases as yet In
Bennington, Pownal or Woodford, but
with cases in North Adams and Ar

New York, it was thought ise to be
careful.
