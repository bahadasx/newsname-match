Over in Illinois, 15,000 pemo
trata voted in the primaries laat
week for a dead an. Votin
dead men ia a common Demc
era tic proceeding, but voting for
one is something quite unusual
ia that party.
Those striking New York trao
tion men should go to Washing
ton and have a law passed fixing
their wane as they want them.
Mr. Wilson would doubt!, -.- call
an immediate eitra su.-oico of
Congress for that purpose.

la inspired doubtless by their
knowledge that, as Jude r.amn

as a ptci.ie pie iiiH' with ants.
The state treasury cannot pa;,

Our Soldiers are being order
ed home from the border, and
they are hrlrjrmn home notninp
that triey were sent after. Inel
dentally it may be mentioned
that the Mexican sent some of
our buyj lioine in wooden over
coat.
The Wilson adminiitratior,
went into ofti -e promising econo
my and fulfills! that promise by
creating thirty thousand new
johs at an annual eost of f H.

The earaful financiering of our
Democratic state nflleial finally
enabled them Ul pay bark to the
achoxls the money t h e v s w i i d t
from tbera when the Kr sco Kail
read paid in Its reorganization
fee. If it hadn't been for the
Frisco the school fund would
atill be in a and nUght.
It must not be preaumed that
because Col (Gardner la a million
aire manufacturer and Uvea In a
big city that he knows nothing
of planting. Planting Is, in fact,
qnlle in line w ith Col. Gardner'
buaincs -th0 coffin line. Ho It
planting 'em all the time, and at
ery lime he make a plant he
liolda up the affix ted and dis

a tribute to hi ability a a plant

Since the Maine election the with th..
Tho primary election In Illinois
last week put another blight on
Democratic) prospects. Tha Ke
pabllcan vote In that elect ion was
neatly fxXUXX), the Democratic
vote waa less than 'J.'.a.lKK), or, in
uther words, th Kepublloan
outvoted the Democrat two to
one. Wnat la the reason for thi
lack of inlereat in Democratic
politic thla year? In Illinois it
can bo explained that a large
portion of the ?ote of that party
baa heretofore been composed of
men of German birth or woo are
native Americana of German
parentage "hyphenalea," to nae
the popular term for them. TV
mese voter Wilson baa trivea
eerioua and unwarranted affenae
because of their sympathies witl
the fatberlaad in the war in
which Germany ia ensaired.
