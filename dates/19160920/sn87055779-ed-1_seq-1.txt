The most alarming feature. It wits
pointed out, is not the mere fact of
the attack against a heavily gar
risoned city In northern Mexico. It
Is said that in order to gain the cen

treachery on the part of a numher

Is said to have been effected only
through the literal use of gold by
the Villista forces. This corruption
of the de facto forces may bt very
has gone forward to the
Mexican City government that miles.
fome drastic militari action can be
taken against the bandits in north
ern Mexico, the effect on the present
negotiations will be very bad. It
wim pointed out to the ("arranza of
Poials that faith in the ability of the
;le facto military forces to clear the
country of bandits and prevent their
activities which the Mexican com
mission l.s trying to create in the
minds of American money interests
will never be realized unless a repeti

The American commission is evi

Question.
GOVERNMENT AGENTS
TO TAKE UP TRAIL
Meeting at Capital is Called.
Alleged Ringleader Sur
renders to the Authori
ties at Chicago.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 20. Pre.
mature arrests threaten the success
of the government's prosecution of
the alleged blackmailers who are
declared to have cleaned up nearly
a million dollars in the larger cities
of the country and the summer re-
! sorts during the last nine months.
Although members of the alleged
band are under arrest in Philadel
phia and Chicago and others are
under surveillance the leaders, the
men and women who are the brains
of the band, still are at large.
Whether they will he captured ad
mittedly is a question.
With a view to securing complete
cooperation among all of the agents
of the department and stamping out
this sort of blackmail Atty. Gen.
Gregory has summoned here a num
ber of his chief assistants. Those
who will devise a general plan of
campaign comprise A. Pruce Piel
aski, chief of the bureau of investi
gation with headquarters here; John
C. Knox, assistant attorney general
In charge in New York. William M.
Oflley. divisional chie.'. New York;
Prank Garbino, divisional chief.
Philadelphia, and H. G. Clabaugh,
divisional chief, Chicago.
CHICAGO. Sept. 20. The scene
of the government's investigation
Into the alleged "million dollar
blackmail syndicate," shifted to
Washington today. Secret service
heads who have been working on
the cases here were hurriedly sum
moned to the national capital late
last night, to confer, it is under
stood, with the attorney general on
ways and means to secure convic
tions of those already in custody.
It is admitted here that it. may
be difficult to gain convictions due
to. the disinclination of the victims
to come forward and testify against
those charged with tleecing them. A
roster of th? duped, it is said, reads
like pages of the Blue P.ooks of sev
eral cities, notably Chicago. New
York and Philadelphia.
Naturally," admitted one official
today.' "those who have paid fabulous
sums of money to hush up the af-
fiiirs do want the 'beans spilled' now
that they realize they have been
duped."
It was intimated, however, that
the government will bring great
pressure to bear on its witnesses and
force them to testify.
William C. Woodward, one of the
alleged ringleaders of the extortion
ists, has given himself up to the
authorities here and was released on
bonds of $:i.000. Mrs. Helen Pvers.
said to be the wife of George Irwin,
another alleged ringleader, also was
released, but the government re
quired $2".,O0O bail in her case. The
other three members are ;till in the

Germany to Pay
For Lives Lost
On Lusitania
I :i tenia t i n; 1 News Service:
Washington. Sept. 20. Ger
many will pay an indemnity for all
American lives lost in the sinking
of the Lusitania. State department
officials made this plain today in dis
cussing the court action in New
York in which the Cunard Steamship
Co. desires to limit its liability in
damage suits to the $91,2i6 received
by it for fares and freight on the
bi liner sunk by a German sub
marine off the Irish coast.
It is expected that the question of
a complete settlement of Eusitania
claims so far as Americans are af
fected, will he taken by Sec'y Lans
ing when Court von IJernstorff, the
German ambassador, returns to this
city for the winter. The issues at
stake had already progressed well
toward the point of arranging a
plan of settlement when they were
interrupted by the sinking of the
White Star liner Arabic on Aug. 19,
1915. When word of the disaster
reached here Sec'y Lansing broke
off the Lusitania negotiations, de
claring that they would not be re
uned until the Arabic sinking had
been cleared up. Germany finally
accepted responsibility for the
Arabic and agreed to pay a monetary
indemnity.
