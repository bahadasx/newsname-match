RETURNING KOfilE
Mrs. L. A. Cunningham Fails
to Find Spouse Who Wrote
to Her to Meet Him
(AociUd tTM by Fadersl Wirlu
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Sept 20
Mrs. L. A. Cunningham of Honolulu,
who arrived here in the steamer
Manoa,' solicited the aid of the police
of this city in: an effort to locate her
husband. She consented to remain at
police headquarters over night pend
ing an investigation, but thus far, it
Is reported,, the police have been un
able to secure any details as to the
whereabouts- of the missing husband.
The police today received a message
from Deputy Sheriff Julius W. Asch
requesting them to allow Mrs. Cun
ningham to go on her way. She
thowed the police letters from her
brother, Henry Zerbe of Honolulu,
persuading her to return home. She
plans to return to Honolulu in t!ie
Wilhelmina.
In search of , an apparently delin
quent husband, 'assailed by wireless
messages on board . detained by the
police during her only night in Saa
Francisco, Mrs. L. A. Cunningham,
formerly Louisa Zerbe, Is today on
ber way to Honolulu in the Wilhel
mina with a 14-day tale to tell her
anxious mother, when she reaches herc
that would do credit to a Rex Beach
romance.
It is a long story of how a young
man-'-left his wife and she followed
him, only to be saved from Uie wiles
of a big city by the generous use of
cable messages, one of which was mis
understood, causing endless confusion,
but it will be told here only in brief
generalities.
Cunningham left Lis wife about 10
months ago, going to the coast and
leaving her at work here at the Qual
ity Inn and living with her mother.
According to the police, Cunningham
recently wrote to his wife saying he
had inherited some money and ask
ing her to come to him as soon as she
bad saved enough money to pay her
passage. The girl decided to go, de
spite appeals of her family to the con
trary. September 12, In the Manoa, she left
for San Francisco and the same day,
but after the boat had left, her mother
received a letter from a family in San
Francisco telling that Cunningham
had spent all his inheritance and ruin
ed the family there. The mother was
frantic and tte brother, Henry Zerbe.
