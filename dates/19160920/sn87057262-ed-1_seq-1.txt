SEVEN SPEECHES
8Y HUGHES TODAY
Republican Candidate in Wis
consin for Several Hours of
Strenuous Campaign
,'sliWork.
The nominee was stimulated by one
of the biggest and best demonstrative
meetings ever held in Illinois. He was
in fighting trim—refusing all ministra
tions for tired throat lnuscles which
his doctor, Dr. L. D. Alexander, Jr.,
proffered, and facing a day's program
of seven speeches In Wisconsin with
a new vim and energy.
Mrs! Hughes wag expectantly wait
ing today for the stop in Wilwaukee
tonight. For in Milwaukee there re
sides Sarah, Williams, who nursed
Mrs. Hughes as a baby. Mrs. Wil
liams is married and lives In Milwau
kee now. Mr. Hughes met one of
Mrs. Williams' daughters at Denver
on the trans-continental trip and an
other at Bangor, Maine. Mrs. Hughes
had lost track of her nurse for years,
but when she met the two daughters,
determined to renew the acquaintance
again in Milwaukee.
It developed today that ^Governor
Hughes had an unpleasant experience
In Springfield late yesterday. After
his speech at the fair grounds, the
governor hurried back to a hotel,
dripping with perspiration and anxious
for a change in clothing. He hustled
into a bath, depositing his soaked gar
ments on a chair. Then he got into
a bath tub. In the meantime there
was a hurried search by the gover
nor's guards for some dry clothes. Gib
son, the messenger, and valet, to
whom the garments had been entrust
ed had disappeared. There was a
hurried search for Gibson— and
the garments. In the meantime
the candidate had finished his
bath aind was shouting for dry
clothes. Because they were not in
evidence, he had to go to bed tempor
arily, until Gibson put in an appear
ance, breathless with haste and an ex
cuse about a busted tire.
Today's program for the republican
candidate called for rear end train'
speeches at seven Wisconsin cities—
Sheboygan, Manitowoc. Green Bay,
AppletOn, Oshkosh *"id Fond Du Lac,
ending with a night meeting at Mil
waukee.

lary, and who has twenty months
more to serve.
MEXICANS
Carraazista cavalry has given up
pursuit of the Vlllistas and returned
to Chihuahua City, General Gonzales,
announced today.
Harsh criticism of General .Trev
ino's failure to take precautions
against attack are being directed at
the commander by Carranza officials
and adherents on the border. One
high defacto official declared that
Trevino is either a Villista or a cow
ard. It is believed that First Chief
Carranza will again attempt to depose
him from command of the defacto
troops: in Chihuahua. Twice before

Seabury Has No Opposition on the
Democratic Ticket, But Had
Plenty of It on Bull
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
•NEW YOtRK, Sept. 20.—Governor
Charles S. Whitman, republican, cap
tured the progressive endorsement
for governor of New York from Jus
tice Samuel Seabury, democrat gub
ernatorial nominee in the feature
fight of the state primaries yesterday,
incomplete returns indicated today.
Whitman was easily renominated in
the republican primaries where he
led Wm. M. Bennett, toy a majority
that may exceed 150,000. Seabury
both candidates battling for the bull
moose vote. Whitman was supported
by the Perkins-Roosevelt faction of
the "progressive party, advocating a
return of the progressives to the G.
O. P. and Colonel Roosevelt had writ
ten a letter opposing the nomination
of Seabury. Justice Seabury was
backed by the anti^Hughes element
among the progressives, composed of
those who wished to hold the party
together, and those who arp support
ing President Wilson.
Only 46,000 progressives were en
rolled in the state and the vote was
extremely light.
Gweraor Whitman had a majority
of 2,700 in 3,192 election districts, out
of a total of 5,719. The democratic
candidate, however, was gaining some
strength as delayed returns arrived
from up-state and there was a pos
sibility that Whitman might be
nosed out.
Next to the gubernatorial battle
for the progressive vote, the fight
for the United States senatorial nom
inations presented the best spectacle.
William F. iMcCombs, former demo
cratic national committeeman, who
was backed by the organization, won
the democratic nomination to the sen
ate handily over Thomas F. Conway,
former lieutenant governor, piling up
a big lead in New York City.
The result of the fight between
Robert Bacon, former ambassador to
,France, and Wm. 'M. Calder, for the
republican nomination to the senate
was in doubt early today.
Bacon jumped into the contest
late, on a platform advocating uni
versal military service. He was sup
ported by Colonel Roosevelt, ex
Senator Root and Wm. Barnes, ex
national committeeman. Calder advo
cated an army of a quarter of a mil
lion.
Calder carried New York City by
about 30,000, but Bacon was running
ahead in the up-state districts and
apparently had a good chance of] jrjuer8
winning on the late returns from up
state. Both sides are claiming vic
tory.

President Wilson Is today prepared
for an Invasion of the west. The time

There is no question but that
President Wilson will discuss at

proposed for settling the recent strike

the democratic atmosphere after a
