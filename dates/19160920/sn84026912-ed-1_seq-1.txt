over the. Rio Grande river, last night,
F. L. Smith, a private In the Butler

The bullet from the Mexican's sun
whizzed close by Smith's bead and
the Mexican had his gun drawn and
was sighting straight for Smith's
head for his second shot when tho
American guard interfered and res
cued the South Carolinian before the
Mexican soldier could pull the trig
ger.
The Palmetto soldier was turned
over to the provost marshal of tho
El Paso district, who kept him during
tho night and this morning turned
him loose with instructions to get
back to his camp.
It was first reported in Fl Paso last

company, came to the city this after
noon, and on investigation found
that the man was a private in Com

manded by Capt. Workman.
