BROKEN PROMISE
RECORD 13 !
SHOWN
Nominee Hughes Calls Demo-i
crats to Account in His
Peoria Speech.
PEORIA, III.. Sept. 20.?Charles K.
Hughes, Republican nominee for pres
ident. said in his speech here Tuesday:
Our opponents present a record of
broken promises. They promised to
reduce the cost of living. They have
not touched IL
They promised to prevent wasto i
and extravagance. They have been
more extravagant in tho recent Con
gress, as I atn informed on unlrn-1
peachable authority, than any preced-,
ing Congress.
Our opponents promised to supply
the principles of the merit system.
They have betrayed the merit system.,
Our opponents promised to reduce
useless offices. Instead they have
created useless offices.
Fall to Protect Citizens.
Our opponents promised that the
rights of American citizens should bo
maintained throughout the world, their
rights with respect to life and prop
erty. They have shamelessly failed to
perform that proiniso.
Acts are facts, and extravagant
claims cannot deceive the intelligent
electroate.
Our opponents claim they have clari
fied the anti-trust law by definition. I
may say here and now that they have |
done nothing of the sort. They claim
to have recuperated the merchant ma
rine. They have done nothing of the
Bort.
The federal reserve act as indorsed
by the administration and presented to
Congress was a wholly unworkable
bill. It was finally worked out by
students and others until it emerged
in different form, but that system as ;
it Is contains dangerous possibilities
of Inflation.
Child Labor Not Emancipated.
Our opponents claim to have eman
cipated child labor. As a body they
have not emancipated child labor. If
our opponents are genuinely devoted
to the Interests of children let them
act In states under their control and
there will be no child labor problem
in the United States.
It is said that American business I
has been adided?and it is the most j
extraordinary claim of all?by the;
passage of the Underwood law. There1
is the true relation of our opponents !
to our American enterprise. It was a
bill which closed factories, halted
industry and sent forth our working
men In hundreds of thousands upon '
the street looking for employment.
An aid to business?yes. that is the
conception of our opponents of what
is an aid to American industry. The
sooner we get away from that situa
tion and trust American enterprise and
believe in the Republican doctrine of
protetcion to American Industry, the
sooner wo will lay the basis for endur-,
ing prosperity in this country.
