O'COIELL'S PLEA
ADDS TO MYSTERY
OF STIELOW CASE
Influences With an Apparent
Political Tinge in Appeal
for Pardon.
AFTER WHITMAN NOW?
A Maze of New Affidavits on
Confessions, Recantations
and Reiterations.
(Special from a Staff Correipondtnt
of The Evenlnn World.)
ROCHESTER, Sept. 20. What Is
the mysterious Influence- with a
strong political tinge which Is trying
to get Clarence O'Connell out of Au
burn Prison, and who Is behind this
Influence, which Is so powerful that It
does not hesitate to go to Oovernor
Whitman and ask for O'Connoll's par
don? Is It the same Influence that
has persistently pushed Charles title
low toward the electric chair?
Tho Evening World has just learned
that O'Connell, nfter serving a yoar
of his sentence, has discovered that
he Is Innocent and has applied through
the usual channels to tho Oovernor
for a pardon. The application was
written out by O'Connell In Auburn
Prison,
He Is not only serving a seven-year
term thoro for a murderous assault
on Lewis H. Browne commlttod In
September, 1914, but stands accused
In the confession of Erwln King, bis
vagabond pal for seven years, of tak
ing part In the murder of Charles
Phelps and Margaret Wolcott at West
Shelby, Orleans County, in March,
1916, the crime of which Stlclow was
convicted.
U Is true that Erwln King, after
being seen by District Attorney John
C. Knickerbocker of Orloans County,,
who convicted Stlulow, has rocunted
his confession that ho and O'Connell
killed Mr. I'heips ana miss wolcott
The mysterious Influence In tho caso
lias not neglected King, who Is held
In the Jail In Albion, tho county seat
of Orleuns County, an a "material
witness," with tlio use of a bathroom,
a supply of tobacco and butter mc.ls
than ho ever nto In his life before.
Strnngely enough, In this tangled
and fascinatingly Interesting caco
there stands, as against King's recan
tation of his confession Involving
O'Connell In the Phelps-Wolcott Mur
der, a confeaslon signed by O'Connell
Involving King In the assault on
Browne. And this confession, to carry
the parallel of tho unusual still fur
ther, ubsolves another man who waa
convicted, Just aa King's original con
fession Implicating O'Connell atrolves
Stlclow.
O'Connell Is incommunicado In An
burn Prison. The Evening World
correspondent went to Auburn to see
him and ask him about King's con
fesslon, but Warden Ratljan kept tho
prisoner tinder cover. Howevor, Dis
trict Attorney Knickerbocker of Or
leans County, who had nothing to do
with tho prosecution of O'Connell for
tlio crime of which ho wus convicted,
was committed In Cattaruugus Coun
ty, had no difficulty In seeing O'Con
nell In Auburn Prison early this
month. Warden Ratlgan opened right
up to District Attorney Knicker
bocker.
It Is not known at this time whether
the application for a pardon for
O'Connell preceded or followed DIs-
trlct Attorney Knickerbocker's visit
to the convict In Auburn Prison, Hut
It was only a few days ago when
