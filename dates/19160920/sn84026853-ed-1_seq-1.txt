SPECIAL NOTICE TO PUBLIC.
As the winter months are coming
on and fires will be built in fireplaces
and heaters after standing
idle during the summer, it will be
well to keep i keen eye for fires
that may arise from defective flues,
etc.
Every one discovering a fire,
whether large or small, will please
phone to the telephone office and instead
of asking for the fire department,
tell the operators just what or
whose house is afire. In so doing,
they will give a better alarm and
will get you better aid more quicMy
than if you simply ask for the department.
We get this phone and alarm service
free and both the operators and
firemen can best serve you if you
will just tell CENTRAL and then
Mutt and Jeff will soon have the big
white wagon loaded with the boys on
their way to help you.

McLAUREN SAYS
HE WILL RESIGN
Hon. John L. McLaurin has written
a letter to Senator J. A. Banks
oi src. naaunews announcing ms intention
to retire shortly as Warehouse
Commissioner in this state. He
gives as his reason for this determination
the statement that the Manning
administration does not stand
for the progressive development and
management of the institution.
Mr. McLaurin was elected Warehouse
Commissioner at the special
session of the legislature called at
the commencement of the war. Although
he did not belong, to the faction
then in power his ability as an
organizer and as a man of affairs was
recognized and he was placed at the
head of the institution. He has done
good work in the position but unfortunately
he has mixed politics
with a strictly business proposition.
By reason of his support of Mr.
Bldase in the recent race for Governor
he placed himself ou{ of sympathy
with the Manning Administration.
His retirement has been all but demanded~by
that portion of the press
of the state which is pro-Manning,
and it is believed that his retirement
is due in a great measure to this
fact. ,

He came up from Florida to see his
father, Judge Hill, who has not been
well for some time. R. E. is looking
well and prosperous, which gives
pleasure to his many boyhood
friends. He says the only drawback
he has in life is the fact that he
is getting too many gray hairs in his
head. This is from the pious life he
is living for he has many miles along
life's highway before he will strike
the mile post touched by the finger
of time.
IN THE CITY.
Mr. W. E. Hill left Abbeville last
Friday for Charleston, where he will

The Secret of
The Submarine
A MUTUAL SPECIAL FEATURE
AT THE OPERA HOUSE ON
? FRIDAY.
"The Secret of the Submarine,, the
sensational American-Mutual preparedness
photo novel, promises to be
the most interesting of the releases
for this season.
Director Sargent has injected into
1 this production a number of unusually
startling situations, which complicate
the plot, to a great extent, and
adds materially to the interest and
tenseness of the story. Thomas Chat-1
terton and Juanita Hausen, who have
won nation-wide fame through their
remarkable acting, are co-stars in'
wonderful photo-play.
Roosevelt's great Chicago speech,
(April 29) was in effect a powerful
endorsement for such a preparedness
plan as suggested by "The Secret of
the Submarine"! He said:
"We need beyond everything else
a first-class navy.' We cannot possibly
get it unless the naval program
is handled with steady wisdom from
the standpoint of a nation that accepts
the upbuilding and upkeep of
such a navy as cardinal points of
continuous policy!"
CONVICT LABOR LOWERS
COST OF CALIFORNIA ROADS
I
I
The difficulties of building roads
in the mountains are many. The
transportation of supplies to the
i workmen, the construction of satis i
factory quarters, and the execution
of the work under the conditions of
weather and topography existing in
the mountains are so troublesome
that contractors require stiff prices
' for such roads. In the mountainous
counties of California, the State
Highway Commission is now building
hghways very sucessfully with convicts.
All through the snows and
rains of last winter two gangs of 125
convicts, without armed guards, living
in camps of unequaled character1
and living on food of unsurpassed
quality for such work, labored away
on a very difficult road through a
mountain canyon. When the bad
weather ended, it was found that the
eight miles thus built cost one fourth I
less than the engineers' estimated'
and a little more than half what
similar work in the same locality had
cost when done by contract. With
theadvent of good weather the cost
became less. "There is no longer a
question that convict labor is not
only successful as a humanitarian
measure," the Commission reports,
UUt Ulttl lb Will Illttftt VUV,

tain roads that otherwise could not
be built."
TOWNSHIP ROAD
PROBLEMS IN IOWA
V
The Iowa State Highway Commission
has issued some very strong
praise of the work done on local
roads by the township trustees of the
state, who spent about $3,500,000
last year on such improvements. This
is equivalent to $40 a mile. "

Abbeville Was Once

French protestants from Rochelle

There flourishes the grape as well as J

ARE CITIES CONCERNED-*
, IN RURAL ROADS?
There is an occasional complaint
that people living in cities, unless
they own automobiles, .have no concern
in rural roads aitif should not i v)
be taxed for their improvement. An
interesting lgiht on this point is N
shed by an editorial in the "Daily
Town Talk," of Alexandria, La.,
which reads as follows: "Attention
has again been called to the almost
impassable condition of the road to
Marksville. One of the worst places
in this road is the Bayou Marie
swamp and the hill in that section,
which is almost impassable for
teams. Parties coming through there today
state that the road is too bad
fny trovol now and that in the fall
and winter it will be much worse.
The condition of this road is injuring
trade in Pineville and Alexandria,
used as it is by a large number of
farmers living in that section, who
will go toward Marksville instead of
traversing this road to come to Pine,
ville and Alexandria. It is stated
conservatively that aa thousand bales
of cotton will be diverted from here
to Marksville ths season on account
of the condition of the road,, unless
it is improved at once." Every progressive
town has a board of trade
or its equivalent, which strives to
attract rural trade to the town's
shops. If the roads leading to the
J ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? J in
town are su puur us wav uckhucu m
the quotation, a check is not only
placed on the trade from the farmers
but the number of thrifty farms is
kept down, for no intelligent man
desires to isolate his family in lonesome
solitude by living where conditions
are like those on "the road to
Marksville."
LEAVING US FOR THE WINTER.
Mrs. Frank B. Gary and young
Frank, left Tuesday for Charleston,
where Frank will stand the entrance
examination for the Citadel in which
enterprises every one wishes him
great success. Mrs. Gary will spend
the greater portion of the winter in
Charleston, as Judge Gary will hold
most of his courts in the low coun
try. Her friends will miss ner
greatly but wish her a pleasant sojourn
in the city.
