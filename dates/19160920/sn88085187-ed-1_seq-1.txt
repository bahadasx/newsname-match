Booze Is
Delivered
at Night
(Special to The Tlmea.)
SEATTLE, Sept. 20.—Bootleg
gers have combined into one big
syndicate with the financial
backing of wholeaalo liquor deal
ers ln San Francisco and are dis
tributing large quantities of
liquor through the county ln
autos under cover of dark
ness, according to Sergeant Put
nam, head of the police dry squad.
"They are getting co-operation
from at least one railroad," he
explained today, "and we are fac
ing the toughest problem we
have had, now, trying to uucover
them."
Tlie Billingsleys and former
Seattle and Tacoma saloon men
are cogs in the combine, he
charged, but confine their activi
ties to distributing large consign
ments.
Deliveries at Night.
Instead of centering supplies in
drug stores, the police have learn
ed that trunks full of bottle goods
are delivered to residences, often
at night time.
"These are merely jobbing sta
tlonH," he said, "and we have
learned that solicitors have regu
lar routes covering different sec
tions of the city, especially cheap
lodging houses. There the retail
ers buy smnll quantities, and ped
dle the booze to the consumers at
fancy prices."
"We are not able to trace the
booze as consistently as before,''
he explained. "Most of the cars
are sidetracked outside the city,
and the deliveries made to auto
trucks. We know that much of
the stuff is taken to caches out
side the city, and later delivered
ln small quantities to the city dis
tributing points."
Will Htna.Ni, 'Km.
The big idea, in combining, was
to protect the valuable shipments
of booze, and eliminate the big
risk of having them seized in the
City.
Mayor Gill said Tuesday that he
was going to Teopen a wrecking
campaign because "it's the only
way we can get results."
"Let 'em sue," he repeated.
"We are going to even wreck
some of these rooming houses if
they continue as blind pigs."
Captain Asks
Policemen to
Pull For Chief
Setting a precedent among the
police, Capt. Cornish appeared be
fore all three squads of city po
licemen Tuesday evening, and de
livered speeches asking the offi
cers to "pull together" and make
the new police administration a
success.
"We need harmony in the de
partment, boys," pleaded Capt.
Cornish.
"We have a fine chief of police,
9 man who will give every one of
us a square deal. The thing for
every officer on the force to do
now is to get into the harness and
work together to make this ad
ministration the most successful
ln the history of the department.
"I'm going to do my best to
make it a success, If have to work
20 hours a day."
The men received Cornish's re
marks enthusiastically.

Henry Mcßride, republican

placed himself flat-footedly on
record as a "dry."
In a prepared statement he de
clared against any attempt to
amend the dry law, unless it be to
strengthen the means of enforc
ing it, and also put himself on
record against Initiatives 18 and
24.
He said:
"From an economic as well as
from a moral viewpoint our dry
law has been of great value to the
people of this state. It should
not be disturbed. I am opposed
to the legislature's making any
changes in it unless It be to
strengthen the means of enforcing
it.
Against 18 nnd 24
"Two initiative measures, one
known as No. 18, or the hotel bill,
and the other as No. 24, or the
brewers' bill, are before the peo
ple for adoption or rejection at
the November election. In my
judgment, the adoption of these
initiative measures, or either of
them, would be a step in the
wrong direction.

"Surely it is the duty of not

coming election.
"Therefore, it is urgently re

President Wilson and both

every honorable means to retain
In office regardless of partisan

Proposes
Municipal
Insurance
A municipal fire insurance com
pany, to carry insurance on any
Taconia properly, was the city
council's answer Wednesday to
the threat of fire underwriters
that they would effect a 10 per
cent increase in fire insurance
rates if any cuts were made in
the Tacoma fire department dur
ing 19)7.
Commissioner Atkins proposes
that the city inaugurate a fire in
surance bureau, to be operated
with certain reserve funds of the
city on the same lines that large
insurance companies are man
aged.
This municipal Insurance com
pany could issue fire insurance
to Taeoinuns at ordinary rates,
and still earn a good Interest on
the money, according to Atkins.
Not Mere Bluff.
"This Is not a bluff," Atkins
declared. "The city faces a
crisis where it has to cut down
operating expenses, and the fire
department Is one place where
cuts have to be made. The fire
underwriters threaten to increase
all insurance rates 10 per cent. If
we touch the fire department.
"My answer Is that we can or
ganize a municipal insurance
company, and compete with the
outside companies. If the under
writers don't believe that tlie city
will do it, just let them advance
the insurance rates."
When the council meets Mon
day morning to begin its annual
municipal expense estimates it
will have to cut $227,890.50 from
estimates already prepared. This
is nearly one-fifth of tlie total es
timated cost of government,
which is $1.193,280.r>0.
Last year the early estimated
expense was $1,196,665.55, and
this was cut to $1,109,233.29.
Uch-oii Is I/ower Values.
The cause of this year's en
forced big cut is the decrease ln
valuation of city and county prop
erty and reduced the amount of
tax money available for operating
the city. Estimated receipts for
1916 were $1,121,395.75, and for
1917 are $965,390.
Practically all commissioners
have reduced their estimates for
departmental expense in 1917 be
low this year's figures, except
Commissioner Pettit.
In the public safety department
Pettit has incorporated all the ex
tra expense which he feels that
his department needs for next
year, and will ask the council to
use Its own judgment In the mat
ter of eliminating items. It is
expected that at least three fire
stations will be cut out.

Tacoman Who Hires
Many Girls Puts
j Personality First
By Mabel Abbott
"Employers are looking
for (.nun girls. They want
giiK with personality, intelli
gence and education; but
above all they want GOOD
glrls."
That Is what C. W. Rhodes, of
Tacoma's big department store,
the man to whom literally hun
dreds of girls apply every month
for work, said Tuesday.
The busy season is beginning
in the stores, and presently the
holiday rush will be on; and many
girls are getting up their courage
to apply for positions, or wonder
ing why they were rejected when
they did apply.
Hear, girls, Mr. Rhodes' advice,
based on years of experience.
She Must He Neat.
"A girl must have personality.
She doesn't need to be pretty—
she can't make her face over. But
she can make her clothes over, If
necessary, and she can be neat.
"If she comes to me for work
her waist sticking out over her
belt and her hair disheveled, I
have no place for her.
"The best definition I can think
of for 'personality,' is tbat It is
goodness radiating from the per
son. A good girl is likely to go
to lied in good time, sleep well,
wake in the morning happy, use
plent.i of snap and water, dress
neatly and arrange her hair pret
tily aud like her work; —and that
mean 'personality.'
Common Sense Important.
"She will smile at a customer
because she is genuinely inter
ested tn what the customer wants.
And she will be able to smile even
if she feels like crying, which is a
thing we all have to do some
times.
"Sbe must have a fair educa
tion. She should have gone
through the grades at least, and
a high school education is still
better.
"it la astonishing how
many girls come to me for
place«, who cannot write an
address so that the delivery
department could read it, or
tdd up a aalesallp correctly,
lfany of them do not seem to
have the slightest Idea of
what business really la.
"Then, she must have good,
common, horse sense. The com
mon sense answer to a problem ia
usually the right one. Common
sense will help hei In dealing
with unreasonable customers, and
will tell her whether the customer j

really It unreasonable or not.
"And she must be a 'good' girl
in the narrower sense of the
word; because for the sake of the
many good girls in our store, we
cannot put her among them if she
is not.
"One who employs many girls
learns to recognize almost in
stantly the girl who is not good.
The color of the skin, the walk,
the manner, everything about her
betrays her. If she has been
using drugs to brighten her eyes,
for Instance, I know It at once,
and though she might be the most
experienced and capable sales
woman who had applied to me
that month, 1 could not give her
a place.
"The chances are that her eyes
needed brightening because she
had been dissipating the night be
fore, and I cannot take the chance
of putting her beside a girl who
might get her first lesson ln dis
sipation.
As Brainy As Men.
"But when a neat, clean,
healthy, bright-eyed girl comes in,
with her mind froe and her inter
est ln her work—ah, that Is the
girl we are looking for! We take
her just as quick as we have a
place open, whether she has had
experience or not. She can get
the experience, but she can't get
the personality—the goodness—
unless she is that kind of a girl.
"And if you are going to write
a story for girls, I wish you would
bo sure to put this in—THAT A
GIRL HAS JITBT AS MUCH
BRAIN AS A MAN. Too many
tlrls think they cannot go far-In
lusiness because they are girls. ■
"There is no limit ahead
of a good, bright girl, who
loves her work."
