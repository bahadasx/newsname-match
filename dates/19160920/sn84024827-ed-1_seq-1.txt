BOYS' SECRETARY OF Y"
DISAPPEARS FROM BISBEE
L. R. Carter, Active in Church
and Social Circles Through
out District, Drops Out of
Sight at El Paso.
BRIDE PROSTRATED
FEARS FOUL PLAY
Youth Left Here September
First for Short Vacation
May Have Suffered a
Nervous Collapse.
Church and social circles in
Bisbee were dumbfounded last
night by the report that L. R. Car
ter, Boys' Secretary of the Bisbee
Y. M. C. A. had disappeared fol
lowing a trip to El Paso early
this month, and no trace can be
found of his whereabouts. Mrs.
Carter, his bride of a few mcnths, .
is reported nearly prostrated
from shock, and insists that some
serious accident must nave be
fallen her husband.
Carter left Bisbee on a vacation
trip September 1, having com
plained of not feeling well since
his trip down to Mexico two
months ago and thinking a few
days' rest might do him gord.
From El Paso, two weeks go, it is
said, Mrs. Carter received a long let
ter from her husband deploring the
fact that she could not be with him,
but explaining that he would be back
soon and he would tell her all aoout
hi trip.
Investigations Fruitless
Up to date, however, Mrs. Carter
has failed to receive any word from
him, although investigation has been
trade and no trace has been (heard of
him. .' k s
r I Foul Play Feared l
Y. M. C. A. officials are equally per
turbed by the young man's disappear
ance, and are inclined to believe with
Mrs. Carter that some mlsfDrtune, or
even foul play may have been done
him.
All inquiries sent to Douglas. Co
lumbus, N. M, Juarez and El Pas'
have failed to get even the remotest
trace of the young man.
Was In III Health
It was known that he was suffering
of ill health following his trip to
Pershing's expedition where he estab
lished an army Y. M. C. A. and It Is
regarded possible that overwork has
driven him into a temporary nervous
collapse.
Carter's close affiliation with the
army, however, might, it Is believed,
have inspired him to take a long ten
day "hike" with a division of troops
north from El Paso, in which case
his reappearance would be announced
shortly, and the mystery solved.

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Sept. 20. The victor
in the Republican nomination for U.
S. senator in the primary, remained
in doubt at 2:15 o'clock this morning.
At that hour, with 4.124 districts
heard from out of a total of 5,179 in
tpe state, Wm. M. Calder was leading
Robert Bacon by about 1200. The flg
Aree were: Caldr 109,551; Bacon,

ing Judge Samuel Seabury, Demo
crat, for the Progressive endorse
ment for governor. Only a frac
tion of the 46,000 enrolled Pro
gressives in the state voted, an
average of only about four to a
district.
The Progressive vote aroused much
interest among state and national
leaders for it was regarded as giving
some light on how the strength of the
party would be divided in the nation
al election. A majority of the Pro
gressive leaders of the state favored
Mr. Whitman's candidacy. The lead
ers of the so-called insurgent wing
who gave their aid to Judge Seabury
professed to be more than satisfied
with the result. In sixty one up state
districts heard from at midnight, Sea
bury led Whitman but by less than
100 votes.
The contest between former con
gressman Wm. M. Calder, and Robert
Bacon, former ambassador to France,
for the Republican nomination to the
U. S. senate, was closely contested.
William F. McCombs, former chair
man of the Democratic national com
mittee who was designated for the sen
atorial nomination by the unofficial
Democratic state convention, was
leading his opponent, Thos. F. Con
way, a former lieutenant governor, by
more than two to one at midnight.
State Senator Wm. M. Bennett, who
opposed Governor Whitman, had re
ceived only 15,671 votes compared to
87.C96 for Whitman.
NEW YORK, Sept. 19. Returns
from 1572 districts of 7179 in the state
received at midnight, gave Gov. Whit
man 3.781 as against 2,769 for Judge
Samuel Seabury, Democrat. The con
test for the Republican senatorial no;n
ination was relatively close. Wm. Cal
der had 38.092 votes as compared",
with 42,832 for Robert Bacon. Will
iam F. McCombs led his opponent,
Thomas F. Conway by 14.000 votes for
the Democratic nomination for the

For the Republican gubernatorial
nomination Whitman has received
87.896 as compared with 15,671 for

MEXICO PLANS
TIDNAL
Chain of Government Banks,
Replacing Foreign Ones
Suspended, Is Dream of the
Mexican Commissioners.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 19.
A plan for a Mexican national bank
ing system to take the place of the
national bank and the Bank of Lon
don ana .Mexico in Mexico City, was
outlined to the American members of l
the joint Mexican-American commis
sion here today by Luis Cabrera, chair
man ofthe Mexican commission.
Chain of Banks
Mr. Cabrera explained that mone
tary commission has been created that
will have supervision of a chain of
government banks and it is hoped to
obtain financial banking, chiefly from
Mexican sources, to support the
scheme.
Suspend Foreign Banks
This explanation was given after
the American members had asked to !
be enlightened on the order suspend
ing the two institutions. Mr. Cabrera
said the two banks bad issued bank
notes far in excess of their metallic
reserve, and recently had refused to
sell to the government exchange on
foreign banks at rates demanded by
the government. The Institutions had
been ordered to show a metallic re
serve equivalent to their issue of pap
er money, he said.
Mr. Cabrera added that the step
was largely retaliatory, as the banks
of Mexico, chiefly the two in question
were responsible for depreciation of
Carranza currency.
Border Touched On
The border situation was discussed
In a casual way, but without much
progress. William rhlllips, assistant
secretary of state, conferred with the
American representatives. Counsellor
Polk of the state department, is ex
pected here tomorrow.
American and Mexican members of
the commission made a trip this af
ternoon in a K type U. S. submarine.
The craft was submerged for several
minutes, during the brief cruise. It
was the first time the Mexican com
missioners had been in a submarine.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19. An eight
hour day fo rtrain crews and switch
engine crews in the Tanama Canal
zone has been established by Gover
nor Goethals by executive order.

SPRINGFIELD, Ills., Sept. 19.
Charles E. Hughes, addressing an au
dience in the Arsenal here tonight,
renewed his attack on the adminis
tration for passage of the Adamson
law in the face or the threatened rail
road strike. Mr. Hughes discussed
and called .as "futile", the reasons
advocated for its passage; quoted
from President Wilson's address to
congress on the subject; challenged
the statement of Representative
Adamson that the law was passed to
"meet an emergency" and cited a dec
laration attributed to Grover Cleve
land in support of the contention that
the bill was a "surrender to force."
Costly Haste
"We have seen," Mr. Hughes said,
"what appears to be the consideration
of immediately political expediency
at the expense of the public welfare.
Mr. Adamson said, 'it is hasty legisla
tion, I admit, to meet an emergency.'
What emergency? The emergency of
force to which the administration had
capitulated.
"Senator Underwood said 'we have
no information on which to legislate
and to fix rates of wages we are go-
in to and are attempting to do.
Hughes Quotes Cleveland
"Contrast the action of the admin
istration," the nominee added, "with
what was said by Grover Cleveland
in 1SS6 with respect tio labor legisla
tion: 'All legislation on the subject
should be deliberately undertaken
with no purpose of satisfying unrea
sonable demands or gaining partisan
advantage."
"It is idle to excuse the action by
the request for additUfial legislation
with respect to the future. That leg
islation was not obtained. We are
dealing with what was demanded and
actually enacted.
Doesn't give 8 Hour Day
"We have an unjustifiable attempt
to use public sentiment with respect
to an 8 hour working day in order to
justify a bill which does not provide
an S hour working day but relates on
ly to an increase in wages."
"Mr. Hughes spoke before a crowd
ed house that frequently interrupted
him to applaud. His speech tonight
was his second In Springfield. The
first at the state fair grounds this af
ternoon dealt chiefly with discussion
of protection of American rights and
American property.
The audience cheered and applaud
ed loudly. Mr. Hughes left Spring
field at 11 p. m. for Milwaukee. He
will reach there tomorrow night and
will deliver six speeches enroute.

"The President has no intention of

The President plans to make ad

these will be made Saturday after
