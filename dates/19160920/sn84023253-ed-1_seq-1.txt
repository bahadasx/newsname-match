OFFICER HENRY HERE

After Licenses and Issues Warning.
Officer Henry of the state automo

Throughout the day automobilists
and motorcyclists were halted and
tailed upon to produce their licenses.
If they produced, all well and good,
if not the little red book was called
Into use and their name taken. Each
driver as their car was stopped was
also treated to a bit of advice in re
gard to driving around street corners
faster than 12 miles an hour. They
were told that the standing orders of
Chief Finley was that all exceeding
that rate of speed should be arrested
in the future. A large gallery of
spectators was present at times dur
ing the day watching the proceedings
which at times afforded amusement,
especially when the automobile oper
ator was found to have left his li
cense at home or when a few were
unable to produce at all. But there
were but few of these cases.
It is expected that Officer Henry
will be in town at least a day more if

SAYS THREATS MADE.
Frank B. Jacques Alleges That He Is
Obliged to Carry the Matter to Au
thoritiesRan Over Pet Dog.
A curious situation has arisen over
the death of the pet dog of Glen and
Floyd Cheever. The dog was run
over on Eastern avenue, Wednesday
by Frank B. Jacques. Mr. Jacques al
leges that the Cheever boys made dire
threats at him for runninig over the
dog and that the boys came to hit
residence on the night of the accident
and caused a disturbance. Mr
Jacques further states that he has
made complaints to the authorities
and that if some action was not tak
en at once he will take the matter to
authorities higher up.
According to witnesses of the dog
killing, Mr. Jacques was driving his
automobile slowly, and when near the
fire station, the dog walked in fron
of the machine. He applied hi;
brakes and stopped with the wheel
of the machine on the dog. Mr.
Jaques took the dog to the home oi
the owner and left it. In the mean
time Glenn Cheever had heard that
the animal had been run over and
after finding out whose machine it
was that killed the dog, went to Mr
Jacques' office where it is said dire
threats were made.
The ill feeling grew during the
day, and both young men went
to the Jacques residence in the
early evening, where some annoyance
to the family was caused and Offijstr
Thomas Wallace responded to keep
order.
The opinion of the Messrs. Cheever
was said to have been anything bu:
complimentary to the police forct
when aired at the meeting in the po
lice station Thursday. At this time i
was said that all threats that the
complainant said were made were
emphatically denied, as well as the
responsibility for any disturbance
that was made at Jacques' residence
Wednesday night.
The case is still pending further
action by the parties concerned, and
the only fact that seems certain i:
that the dog causing the trouble is
dead.
CHEEVERS PAY FINES
For Breach of Peace Jacques Did
Not Express Intention of Taking
Matter Higher Up.
In Saturday's Caledonian we print
ed an article in regard to the running
over of a pet dog belonging to Glen
and Floyd Cheever by the automobile
of Frank B. Jacques and of threats
that were alleged to have been made
afterwards by the owners of the dog
against Mr. Jacques. Mr. Jacques
takes exception to the following
statement:..
"Mr. Jacques further states that he
has made complaints to the authori
ties and that if some action was not
St. Johnsbury Academy formally
opened its seventy-fifth school ' year
yesterday, when chapel was called at
8.45 a. m. Rev. F. S. Tolman of the
Baptist church conducted the. devo
tional exercises, and in his address
suggested a motto for the senior class
"Go To It."
Immediately aftet the address
Principal M. G. Benedict announced
the opening of the school year. He
reported that 303 pupils had enrolled
on Monday, registration day, being
the largest enrollment St. Johnsbury
Academy has had for 25 years.
'Among the visitors was Dr. E. F.
Fairbanks of St. Johnsbury, Robert
Mackinnon of Washington, D. C, and
Mrs. Boynton and daughter, Kather
ine, both of St. Johnsbury. In spite
of the fact that it was opening day
every recitation was in full swing and
such was the organization and de
portment of the pupils that a visitor
would hardly know it to be the first
day.
The attitude of the students to
ward their work and their spirit in
regard to fooling in classes indicate
the most successful year the institu
tion has ever had.
That good words travel is decisive
ly proved in the fact that both dor
mitories of the academy are full,
nearly to capacity.
The first football practice of the
year was called last night by Captain
Lougee, about 30 candidates reporting
to Coaches Gould and Stradley, six
of whom are veterans. The work waa
all light, but owing to the two weeks'
delay in the opening of school the
hard workouts must soon begin. A
full schedule of the Academy team
will be printed in The Caledonian
sometime before the first game.
BIG ENROLLMENT INDICATED
Work Not Yet Completed But Record
Number of Pupils Assured In
Common Schools Other Notes.
The work of enrolling all the pn
pils in the common schools has not
yet been completed but indications
are that the number will establish a
new record for St. Johnsbury. The
enrollment of Grades V, VI, VII and
VIII shows that they will be largi
than ever before.
Two new rooms have been opened
at the Summer street school, one for
the use of, the third grade and th
other for the fourth grade. These
rooms which will accommodate 32
and 24 pupils have previously beer
unused except one of them part i
the time for sewing class.
Supt. Young In speaking of the bi?
enrollment at the academy said b
believed it was partly because a year
ago the lower schools gradauted 117
pupils, a record number, and that coff
siderable attention had been used ir
impressing on the grammar schoo
scholars the importance of going fur
ther in their, studies. He anticipates
a larger total number of scholars this
year than last, despite the fact that
several families have moved away
from town.
An innovation this year will be sew
ing for girls of the eighth grade and
mechanical drawing for the boys
There has been sewing before for the
girls of the fifth and sixth . grades
which will be continued.
Notwithstanding the increase in at
tendance the two new rooms at the
Summer street school, together with
the extra room that has been enjoyed
in previous years, are expected to
amply care for all pupils. Only one
room is crowded enough to affect the
efficiency of the teaching force and
this will be remedied in the near
future.
ATTEMPTED HOLD-UP?
Two Men Armed With Clubs Try 4o
Stop Story Automobile.
While Mr. and Mrs. F. S. Story,
Everett Cole, and Alphone Lancetot
were returning by automobile from
Bartlett, N. H., Thursday evening
two men carrying heavy sticks, tried
to stop the car at a lonely point - in
the road between Crawford Notch and
Bemis. Mr. Story opened up, and
came right along through. The men
who were standing in the road jump
ed for the ditch to escape being
struck by the car.
Members of the party said when
they first saw the men they signalled
as if something was wrong with the
road, but as the clubs looked bad Mr.
Story took a chance oh the road and
speeded by them.
Six Climb Mt. Washington.
Six St. Johnsbury men climbed
Mount Washington on Sunday and
report that the day and the view
were unsurpassed. The party, which
consisted of Fred H. Dolloff. BIrney
L. Hall, Frederick Townsend, Ber
nard Daniels, Carl Salman and John
Gibson went as far as the Crawford
House with H. ' M. Day in his car.
There the party climbed Mount Clin
ton and went over Mount Pleasant to
the Tip Top House, starting at 7.15
and reaching the summit at 1.15.
They arrived at the base at 5.30 after
a 14-mile tramp which left them
somewhat lame the next day, but with
wonderful memories of the country
they had seen.
taken at once he will take the matter
to authorities higher up."
He claims that he stated to us that
he was "urged to," not "will" take
the matter higher up.
During Saturday the Cheevers paid
fines to the amount of $5 each and
total costs of $8.55 on a charge of
breach of the peace.
