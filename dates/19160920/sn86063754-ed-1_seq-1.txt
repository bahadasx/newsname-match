Historical Sketch ot Chesterfield S
County Fair
It might be said that the Chesterfield
County Fair had its origin
in the annual Boys' Corn
Club exhibition at Chesterfield,
that was first held in the fall of
1911 under the supervision and
direction of Major W. J. Tiller
County Demonstration agent.
So successful was the first exhibit
by the boys' Corn Clubs
that the following year the then
Mavftr rkl fVio tmirn /\f
itiuj vi vi iiiv ivy* 11 vi V/Iicaici* i
field, L. H. Trotti, called a mass ?
meeting of the citizens for the i
purpose af enlarging the corn i
club exhibit. At the meeting it j
was decided to hold a one day ]
stock, farm and poultry show in 1
connection with the Corn exhib- 1
it of the boys' clubs. This was <
done under the supervision of ?
such public spirited men as L. i
H. Trotti, W. J. Tiller, C. L. <
Hunley and B. J. Douglass. The t
show was a success, a large s
number of exhibits being <
brought out and many people 1
were in attendance. >
Encouraged bv the progress i
heretofore made and believing (
that a County Fair would pro- i
mote the agricultural interests ?
of Chesterfield County, L. H. i
Trotti issued a call for a meet- 1
ing to organize The Chesterfield j
County Fair Association. The i
meeting was a success and about .
three hundred and fifty dollars ]
was paid in for stock. A char- i
ter was secured for the Fair As- <
sociation, the stock being di- ]
vided into shares of the par i
value of one dollar each. A i
unique feature of the Fair Asso- 1
ciation as incorporated is that I
no dividends ever earned were i
be payable jp. stockholder U
but were to be held as a surplus i
and be expended from year to 1
year to improve the County <
Fair.
At the initial meeting after or ]
ganization the following officers <
were elected, and have served '
avnr oln/.n. D :J J T ?
vv vi suite, i icaiueiii, I... 11. i
Trotti; Vice President, W. J. Til- t
ler; Secretary-Treasurer, C. L. 1
Hunley. These officers at once
assumed their duties and shortly t
thereafter the following Execu- 1
tive Committee was elected: L. i
H. Trotti, J. A. Welsh and Ems- <
ley Armfield. These three to l
have entire charge of the Coun- '
ty Fair. s
A suitable lease on a level >
seven-acre tract of land near the j
J X
uepoi was secured and under s
the direction of President Trotti ]
the grounds were enclosed with ?
a substantial fence and the required
exhibit buildings were
erected. Secretary Hunley directed
the advertising feature of
the Fair and the publication of a
handsome premium list.
The gates to the first Chesterfield
County Fair were thrown
open Wednesday, November 14,
1913, and for three days the peo
pie 01 Chesterfield county flocked
to their first Countv Fair.
To say that the people were
pleased would be putting it
mildly. Kveryone came awaypraising
the Fair and compli
menting the officers in charge.
The Jefferson brass band was <
present during the Fair and <
dispensed inspiring music. c
Before an immense crowd ?
within the Fair Grounds 011 ?
Thursday, Nov. 75th, the Hon. J
W. F. Stevenson delivered an (
address that covered the indus ?
trial developemeut of Chester- s
field County during the past 30 s
years. The speaker pointed i
with pride to the progress that f

great achievements for the future.
The inauguration of the t
Chesterfield County Fair was n I
landmark in the progress of the (
County Fair was a complete It
uccess irom every standpoint.
\long the financial end the Ex- l
scutive Committee was able to
>av off debts of over seven hun- s
Ired dollars that had been con- <
racted in arranging for the Fair. j
The second annual Chester- ^
ield County Fair was held in (
November 1914. When the j
darion call to a world without
trms sounded in August of this |
-ear and the sudden Dlunednp =
nto the greatest conflict in all ,
listory by the nations of Europe j
ind a world cataclysm seemed ]
nevitable, when the entire fi (
lancial structure of the nation (
seemed to be tottering, with the
irice of the South's great staple, (
'King Cotton," toppling downward
far below the cost of pro- (
iuction, with panic everywhere, ,
i large number of Fair organiza- (
tions of South Carolina and (
ither Southern States cancelled ,
heir Fairs. It was the concen
sus of opinion in Chesterfield
bounty that our' Fair would
lave to be cancelled for that ,
^ear like the one in Bennetts- ,
gille. But the officers of The
Chesterfield County Fair determined
that the County Fair
should be held and in spite of
many adverse circumstances
they went ahead and prepared
and pulled off a greater Fair than
the exhibition the year before.
\ great appeal was made to the
people to forget their troubles,
and they were many, for a few
days and attend their Countv
Fair, to mingle in social interin
course with their friends and
sheer up. The County Fair the
fall of 1914 did more than anything
else to help the people to
sast the gloom behind them and
ba-Jiuv?-ooofide?oeHira ^bright
future that was bouncf Ifo be
theirs and only awaited confidence
on their part.
The only feature to mar the
1914 County Fair was the tragic
death of aviator Frank J. Terrill.
The officers of the Fair brought
in aeroplane for the first time to
Chesterfield County and daily
flights were made by Aviator
rerrill to the delight of the
housands of people who for the
first time had an opportunity to (
/iew a bird man. The last day
)f the hair, Friday, November
13, Negro Day, was fatal to Mr. (
rerrill. While flying directly

ind his by-plane dropped with a (
iickening thud to the ground, j
3eath was instantaneous. The (
iviator's young wife, a bride of J
)nly a few months, witnessed
icr husband's fall All that lov j
ng hands could do was done for
he bereaved and the good peo>le
of Chesterfield accompanied <
he sad funeral party as they do- !
>arted for Mrs. Terrill's home in "
Worcester, Mass. *
The third Chesterfield County :
<air was held in November, i
915. Prosperity had leturned .
<> the people. Cotton was bring
ng good prices once more, and '
he people were eager for the 1
Jountv fair to he held. To ad- i
/ertise the County Fair, among
)ther ways, Secretary Hunley l
conducted around the county

A Falsehood Corrected
?regressive Farmer.
We now call upon all farmers
and all papers friendly to farmers
to help correct one of the
most damnable falsehoods vet
perpetrated to cheat growers out
3f a fair price for this year's cotton
crop.
With startling surprise and astonishment
cotton farmers read
in the daily papers last week that
1 meeting of State Farmers' Union
Presidents, held in New Of
leans, had recommended twelve
cents as a minimum price for
cotton.
And this was reported on a
lay when even new crop mid
Jling cotton was bringing 15
cents all over the South! It was
reported also the day after Sup
erintendent Hester published the
cotton statistics printed else
where on this page and in the
irorir nil tf I I
*vir v.iiv vyucic nc J1UUII3IIU11
them!
From Virginia to Texas this
statement of leaders representing
the growers of the crop was
hailed with hallelujahs by the
bears and'with amazement by
farmers. The price of cotton
slumped quickly afterward, and
this report was no doubt partly
to blame.
Now what are the facts? The
facts are that this report was not
only a lie but a lie promoted by
high-handed forgery and fraud.
The facts are that instead of
naming twelve cents a pound as
a reasonable minimum for this
year's crop, the Farmers' Union
Presidents named fifteen cents
and say it should bring twenty
cents. "We find that condisjrojs
warrant a piice of twenty
and we urge fanners not iolell
any cotton at all at less than
fifteen cents," is the official
statement signed by those Union
Presidents who remained in
New Orleans after the discovery
of this amazing fraud.
The tragedy of it is that the
press agency which sent the
false report to all dailies seems
to have sent out no correction
whatever. We therefore urge
all papers friendly to farmers to
copy this article, and for fear
many editors will not see it we
urge every cotton growing reader
to send it to his newspaper.
The fight for fair prices cannot
be defeated by such knavery.
Conditions now are such that
farmers should get back the millions
they lost two years ago
and every farmer should help in
this crusade.

luring the Fair. The Fair this
year was the best held yet and
the financial end was O. K.
After the Fair, announcement
was made by Secretary Hunley
that the Fair did not owe a dollar
to anyone and that there was
a balance in the treasury.
The fourth annual Chesterfield
County Fair will be held
November 8, 9, 10 and 11, of this
year. Extensive preparations
are being made for this year's
Fair to eclipse all those licit!
heretofore. Among the free attractions
will he a woman who
will make a descent from a hal
loon one mile in the air. The
best carnival company ewi tour
ing the South has been contracted
with to furnish the amusements
which are of a high order.
No gambling will be allowed.
All premiums in the exhibit
department will be increased in
numbers and amounts.
All prizes will be payable in

an advance of about 1,000
yards was made and finally the
strongly defended position at
the Mouquet farm, over which
there had been numerous hard

fell into their hands.
To the south of the river the
French pushed back the Germans

Death at McBee
The death of Mr. W. J. Armfield
which occurred at his
home here Friday morning at
2 o'clock was a sad shock to the
entire town and community.
Mr. Armfield was ill just one
week, though the Doctors didn't
give his family and friends any
hopes of his recovery from the
first. Mr. Armfield moved here
from Jefferson about five months
ago. He has won many friends
since coming to McBee who
heard of his death with much
sorrow. Mr. Armfield was about
65 years of age. He leaves a
wife and the following children;
Messrs, Roy Armfield of Va,
Ira Armfield of Scranton, S. C.,
Otto Armfield, of Maxton, N. C.
and Wade Armfield of Jefferson,
and Misses Leiland Armfield, of
Jefferson, and Myrtle Armfield,
of McBee.
The body was carried to Jeffer
son. i ne runerai was conducted
at the Baptist church by his
pastor, Rev. J. C. Lawson. The
interment was in the Jefferson
cemetery. May God bless and
comfort the grief stricken wife
and children.

Walt Mason's Calf
I asked eight dollars and a
half for one fine black Tolled
Angus calf, which price was noi
too high. I hoofed it west, 1 hoofed
it east, endeavoring to
sell the beast but no one wished
to buy. Day after day I toiled
along, and bored men with the
same old song: "I have a calf
for sale; I ask eight bones and
fifty cents, for this unequalled
critter, gent?who will dig up
the kale?" Then, said a friend,
"Oh, rest vour feet and unit

and advertise your sawed-off

same advice, and put my jaded
feet on ice; and when the ad. an*
peared, ten customers came to
my gate; one bought the calf and
paid the freight, the others bucked
and reared. And thus by
