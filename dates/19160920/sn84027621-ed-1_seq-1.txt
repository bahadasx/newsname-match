Opening New System ,
The city plumbing board, provided
for in the plumbing ordinance just
passed by council, met this afternoon
at 2 o'clock at the city hall," for the
purpose of making arrangements for
the opening of Ocala's new $100,000
sewerage system. It is planned to
start the making of house, connections
with the sewers about Oct. 1. The
bcardihis afternoon is working out
the various printed forms and appli
cation ; blanks to be used. An office
for the plumbing inspector has to be
arranged for. The plumbers have to
be examined.
The plumbing inspector is "required
by the plumbing ordinance to notify
the , property owners when to make
connections with the sewers. The
property owner is given 60 days- after
receiving the notice in which to start
making the connection. H. S. Min
shall, plumbing inspector, plans to
notify the property owners in con
gested districts first. Should, how
ever, any proper owner wish to make
a connection before notified by the
inspector to make it, the connection
can' be arranged for. Mr. Minshall
anticipates having enough applica
tions for connections at the start to
keep him busy for some time. It will
take a number of years to, complete
the connections throughout the city.
Mr. Minshall has filed with the city
his bond of $1000 for faithful per
formance of duty.

DETAILS OF ELECTRIC PUNT BUILDING AND MA-
GHIHERV CAUSED A
Since the order was given to tear
out the unsatisfactory brick work at
the new light and water plant, friction
has developed between the contractor
and the engineer in charge, and be
tween the contractor and council, and
this friction gave rise to a heated de
baet in couneii last night. " Mr. Ben
jamin Thompson, contractor, appear
ed before the city's governing body,
with Col. R. A. Burford, as attorney,
and had read letters to Mr. David
Henney, engineer., and letters to coun
cil, insisting that the condemned brick
work was in materials and workman
ship substantially what is required by
the plans and specifications saying
that the work was torn out under pro
test, .and that payment and damages
would be asked forj calling, attention
to a change in the plans for the De La
Vergneil engine, and asking for ap
proval of the same ; s4ying that Mr.
Henney had ordered ttie construction
of the piers fpr the water tower, hot
called for in Mr. Thompson's contract,
and requesting - that J the engineer
make' itemized estimates of the work
done', instead of summarized esti
mates. The request for' payment and
damages for the brick work destroy
ed, it appears, is what Mr. Thompson
had ' reference to when he told coun
cil, at its last meeting, that he' would
be heard from later. Mr. Thompson,
&lso, charged last night that Mr.
Henney had on several occasions made
"misstatements" to council with 're
gard to the work on the plant, and
charged that, as contractor, he had
received no co-operation from council.
Qualifying his charge as to the en
gineer's making misstatements, tho
contractor said that he wished to be
nothing but entirely fair in the whole
matter,' but did not propose to be run
over. ..
Mr. Thompson's letters gave coun
cil some information it had. not pos
sessed, and this information served to
increase the feeling in the controversy
which arose. Engineer Henney was
not present. He is in New York for
a week or 10 days. The matters of
the controversy were referred to him
by council, and a special session will
be held, as soon as the engineer re
turns. At the-request of Mr. Thomp
son, council ordered a telegram sent
to Mr. Henney to ask that he return
at once, or as soon as possible.
The point- was made again last
night with regard to the engineer's
not) remaining constantly on the work
here." Mr. Thompson said that it
greatly, inconvenienced him. not to
have the engineer here. Councilman
Mclver thought that the engineer
should be here constantly. Council
man Weathers thought that Mr. Hen-
ney's position should ' be made plain
once and for all, and, questioning Mr.
Ebner, representing the engineer, Mr.
Weathers brought out that Mr. Hen
ney had been waiting here for the
contractor to continue work, but Mr.
Thompson had gone on a trip to New
York and Canada, and Mr. Henney,
tired of waiting, left for New York.
It was pointed out, too, that there is
nothing to require the engineer to re
main here constantly. He can have a
representative if he wishes, and this
representative he has in .Mr. Robert
Ebner.
Mr. Ebner, representing the engi
neers, told council that Mr. Henney
would have a detailed report to make,
on his return, with regard to the
change of De La Vergne engines; and
would be ready .to' answer any other
question council might wish to have
answered. In the meantime, Mr. Eb
ner said that the contractor had work
enough at the new, plant to keep him
busy.
Mr. Thompson and Col. Burford ex
plained that the contractor had given
a bond, and had contracted to com
plete the work on the plant in a speci
fied time', and that they would like to
have the work proceed as expeditious
ly as possible. Council agreed that
it was time to settle down to the
work, and for this reason ordered the
telegram sent to Mr. Henney. Excep
tion was taken to Mr. Thompson's
charge that council had not co-operated
with him. Councilman Gerig said
that he thought council had given the
contractor co-operation, and that the
relationship had been cordial.
Council had nothing to say last
night with regard to contractor's in
sisting on. payment and damages for
the brick work torn out.
Councilman Meffert requested Mr.
Thompson to tell council what change
had been j made in the De La Vergtie

engine. Mr. Thompson explained that
when he went to. New York to close
with the engineers and the De. La
Vergne manufacturers for the engine,
the De La Vergne people proposed a
substitute for the ; engine first ap
proved by the engineers and city
council. The substitute engine it
was said, would be a much larger and
better engine. Twombly & Henney,
the engineers, agreed to the chagt
of engines, according to Mr. Thomp
son, provided that it would mean !-no
additional cost .to , the y city. - Mr.
Thompson said that the engineers ha8
said that it would not be necessary to
have council's approval of the change
of engines; theengineers. saying that
they had full authority given them
under contract with the city. "
It was this change of engines and,
accordingly, change of foundations,
that the contractor asked that coun
cil approve. Col. Burford and Mr.
Thompson pointed out that delays
were proving costly
Mr. Gibbes, representing the De La
Vergne engine, was, present in coun
cil, and explained that the engine
which the city would get, as a result
of the change spoken of by the con
tractor, would be a much larger en
gine, a much heavier one, and more
economical. He said, that in. view, of
the criticisms made here by the com
petitors of the De La Vergne engine,
the De La Vergne people had decided
to make the best of its opportunity,
and use the Ocala plant to prove the
superiority of their machine. Mr.
Gibbes said that the , manufacturers
of the engine had decided, as an ad
vertisement, to install in the , plant
here a machine that would cost the
manufacturers from $6000 to $7000
more than the city would pay for it.
Mr. Gibbes said this engine was under
construction. He said, also, that as
a result of the installing of the larger
engine, it would be necessary to in
stall a larger generator. An effort
was made to get'the Westinghouse
company, said Mr. Gibbes, to install
the large generator without increas
ing the cost. The Westinghouse peo
ple refused, end it became necessary
for the De La Vergne manufacturers
to stand the additional cost of the
generator, which, Mr. Gibbes said,
amounted to $400 or $500.
Council said that it was true that
Mr. Thompson did not have the con
tract for the erection of the water
tower. It was said, however, that he
did have a contract for the construc
tion of the foundation for the tower;
and attention was called to the fact
that the contract for the tower calls
for its construction from the ground
up. Col. Burford, speaking for the
contractor, admitted that to be true,
but contended that at no place in Mr.
Thompson's contract with the city
was the construction of the foundation
for the tower specifically called for It
was said that the foundation was
shown on the blue prints of the plant,
which are a part of the specifications.
but council did not go into this. It was
decided best to wait for Mr. Henney
to return. .
Mr. Ebner said that he had author
ity to approve the plans for the alter
ed foundation for the De La Vergne
engine. Mr. Thompson contended
that he had found there would be a
difference in the cost of constructing

Bulgaria' is Proving to Germany to
be a Heavy Burden V
Milan, Sept. 20. The Secolo dis
cusses the German conferences as fol
lows: .
"Despite the discontent among the
Old JTurks, Eyer Pasha is the undis-
puted dictator, and enjoys the confi
dence of the Turkish army. The ob
ject of the. conference is the solution '
of the grave -Balkan problems. The
situation of the Germanic League is
critical not desperate." -.
An offensive on the interior lines is
no longer possible. The defensive
power is declining because of, want of
reserves. -The check of the Dobrudja
invasion by the Russian and Rumani-,
an forces may end in disaster. "
Bulgaria desired to continue for the.
last nine months the sham offensive
in Macedonia only to prevent Rumani-.
an intervention. She is now threat-,
ened on a new front, and 'demands
German help. The Bulgarian army, ,
which at the beginning of the war
numbered half a million men, is now
only 400,000 strong. -
The forces of General Sarrall at
Salonica, the Rumanians along the
Danube, and the Russians in the Dob
rudja, are in a crushing superiority.
The fifty thousand Germans, supposed
to be in the Dobrudja, will hardly
suffice. The Turks have in Thrace
about 200,000 men. King Ferdinand
wants half a million Turkish troops
to oppose-the Russian and Rumanian
forces in the Dobrudja, so that the
Bulgarians are free to defend Mace
donia. The Turks have hitherto re
fused to use their army in Thrace, al
leging that it might be needed at any
time for the defense of Constantino
ple, y ,
The Turks would consent if the
Bulgars offered compensation, which
Bulgaria, however is unwilling ' to "
give. Hence, the conference.

by the urgent solicitations of the
Magyars for assistance in Transyl
