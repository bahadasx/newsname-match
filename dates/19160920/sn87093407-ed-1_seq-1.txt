SMITH SCORES
CHURCH TODAY
AS BEING SIN
Dsnomlnitlonallsm, with It*
overlapping activities, and
drift toward narrow commer
cialization mutt cease, and ens
big, broad church bent on
evangelising the masses must
taks Its place.
This wss the declaration of
Rev. Robert Asi Smith, retir
ing moderator of the Seattle
Presbytery, and pastor of Cen
tral Presbyterian church, In a
sermon before members of the
Seattle Presbytery at Bethany
church Tuesday night.
' Denomlnaticmalism has mad#
the church a great institution for
gathering money," he said, "and Is
a sin as It exists today. It has
lost sight of Its commission to
preach salvation to all the people.
Today the church is subject to a
crossfire as deadening in effect as
that on European battlefields. In
dividuals have become selfish.
• The overlapping of church ao»
tivlties is distressing what would
you say If a city tried to maintain
five policemen on every beat?
Churches in the smaller district*
and in the cities as well must b*
combined. The world Is not b»>
llevlng today, because there Is dis
union among us."
Statistics were cited, showing
that 260 Presbyterian churches la
the state did not receive a single
new member by confession during
the last year. The First Presby
terian church. In Seattle, had tb«
highest number received—3l9.
Rev. W. O. Forbes, superintend
ent of missions for the Presby*
terian avnod, was sleeted moder
ator to succeed Dr. Smith.
Seattle Leads Cities
of Nation, Being
Healthiest by Far
Health authorities In every
city in the country are looking
with envious «yes on Seattle's
death rate record of 7.4 psr
thousand, the lowest in the
United States, following the
publication of federal census
statistics.
It wat pointed out that Seat
tle's rate ha* lowered during
the last few yeara, while th«
population Increased. Spokane
It the second healthiest city,
with a rate of 8.1 and Portland
third, with a rate of 8.4.
Learning of hit. "demise,"
(George hurried to Seattle. Ha
filed a complaint Wednesday
In an attempt to have hlmaelf
officially brought to life.
"During my absence," the
complaint reids, "my wife had
me declared dead, altho she
knew, or could have found out,
that I was alive.
"Solemnly, I declare I never
was dead, and am not now."
George and his wife, he said,
parted on June 22, 1906, with
the understanding that he was
to j-eturn In ten year*.
