The Press finds that it is not
alone in rejecting the adv'g offered
us by the so-called South Dakota
Local Option League. We have
noticed some others besides the
Beresford News, which states its
reasons for declining the said ad
vertisment in the following lan
guage:
"The News has been offered the
big six column advertisment for
the Local Option League of the
state, bnt refused it. We find up
op inquiry that the league is back
ed by the saloon interests of the
-country, hence the advertisment
must be in the interests of the sa
loons. Then again local option is
unfair in that it flaunts liquor up
on a community that is without sa
loons by making it possible to pur
chase the liquor in an open saloon
only a few miles away and carry it
to the dry country for consump
tion. Real prohibition wiil come
only when the manufacture and
sale is prohibited throughout the
nation, but the next best is state
wide prohibition, and not local op
tion as asked for by the "league."
While advertising is part of our
stock and trade, yet we believe
:that the interests of Beresford and
vicinity are best served by the
omission of this advertisment.
The local option law cannot give
Beresford a saloon because the
sentiment of the city is against it
so why not assist other commun
ities to get rid of the saloons by
voting for prohibition at the com
ing election."
