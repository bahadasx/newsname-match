SPRINGFIELD. IIL. Sept. 19. Charles E. Huqhes. addressinq an audi
ence in the arsenal Here toniqht, renewed his attack on the administra
tion for oassaae of the Adamson law in the face of the threatened rail
road strike. Mr. Huqhes discussed aid called "futile'1 .reasons advocated
for 'ts osssaqe, quoted from President Wilson's address to congress on
the subject, challenged the statement of Representative Adamson that tho
law we passed "to meet an emergen -.y" nnd cited a declaration attributed
to Grover C'eveland in support of the contention that the law was "a
surrender to force."
"We have seen," Mr. Hughes said, "whnt appears to bo the consider
ation of immediate political expediency at the expense of public welfare.
"Mr. Adamson said 'it is hasty legislation, I admit, to meet an emer
gency,"' Mr. Hughes continued. "Wiat emergency? The emergency of
force to which the administration had capitulated.
"Senator Underwood said 'we have no informaticn on which to legis
late and to i'.K rates of wages which we are going to and are attempting
to do.'
"Contrast the action of the administration,'' the nominee added, "with
whit was said by Grover Clevelnd n 1HSfi with respect to labor legislation:
All legislation on the subject should bo calmly and deliberately under
taken with no pi'rnose of satisfying unreasonable demands or gaining
partisan advantage.'
"It is idle to excuse the aetion-by the request fo additional legislation
with respect to the future. That legislation was not obtained. We are
dealinn with what was demanded and actually enacted.
'Wc have an unjustifiable attempt to use public sentiment with re
spect to an eight-hour working day in order to justify a bill which does
rot provide an eight-hour working day but relates notc-ly to an increase
in wages. We have seen the choice of wnat secmc! to be the easlier way,
which escaped the necessity of a determined stand for principle. We
have seen what appeared to be the consideration of immediate political
expediency at the expense of public welfare.'
Mr. Hughes spoke before a crowd
ed house that frequently interrupted
him to applaud. His speech tonight
was his second in Springfield. The
first at the state fair grounds this
nfternnon dealt chiefly with hi ideas
in protection of American Industrie",
American rights and preparedness.
He also touched tonight on the pro

Vice in Phoenix must go. Houses
of prostitution must close, and Ramb
ling must cease. The scarlet woman
must make her way to greener fields
or cease plying her questionable call
ing in this city. The gaming table
must be silenced, and card sharks will
be called upon to leave the city or find
some more tangible occupation.
This, in substance, will be the man
date sent forth today by Chief of Police
George O. Iirisbols. And this time he
is in deadly earnest, for he Is working
with the hearty support and complete
co-operation of City Manager Robert
A. Craig. Today City Attorney Rich
ard K. Sloan will be called upon by
Manager Craig and Chief Brisbois to
draft complaints against a score or
more proprietors and Inmates of dis
orderly houses and against several
proprietors and emuloves of gambling
places. Warrants will isue on these
complaints, and tonight the entire
police department, both night and day
forces, will lie rent out armed with
these warrants and instructed to serve
them wherever there is even a semb
lance of an attempt t continue in de
fiance of the law.
City Manager Craig returned from
the const a day or two ago. Almost
Immediately afterward Chief Rrisbols
reported to him the result of a quiet
ItivesUTiUioa he hei been conducting
for two or three weeks, anu presented
for his consideration a long list of
plnces ajid names against which he has
iieen enabled to secure direct evidence
of law violations. He asked for the
approval of the manager in closin
these places and arresting proprietors
und inmates. Yesterday afternoon for
two hours Manager t'raig and Chief
Brisbois were closeted in the former's
office, and when the conference ended
the chief was clothed with authority to
proceed
I-ast night every member of the night
police force was busily engaged In se
curing the stnigiling ends of evidence
necessary to make the clamping down
of the lid today thoroughly effective.
The work of gathering evidence has
been conducted so quietly not more
than tine or two members of the police
force knew what was going on. Not
even Manager Craig knew Just how-far-reaching
had been the investiga
tion of Chief tif Police Brisbois. And
the chief himself never dreamed when
he first undertook the work Just how
vast would be the revelations from the
underworld of Phoenix.
There is but one aim on the part of
the manager and the chief. That is to
close every questionable resort in the
city. It is not a matter of arrests, nor
vet of bails paid or Jail sentences
served. It is simply a determination to
rid the city of such places and such
persons.
And these places will remain closed.
hief Itri.sbois told Manager Craig yes
erday that the only way he could in
sure the strict enforcement of the "lid"
mr.ndatc was to instruct his men to ar
rest on the first suspicion that there
were violations and to bring prosecu
tions under the previous complaints if
there is not evidence enough to secure
conviction on later apparent offenses
The city commission meets this
morning, but there will be no effort
either on the iiart of the city manager
ir the chief to bring the situation be
fore that, body unless called upon by
the commission Itseii to do so.
Whether the commission of its own
volition will take any action in the
premises cannot be stated.
In the event of arrests today there
will be no John Doe or Jane Doe en
tries upon the police docket. And the
names of every one arrested will be
published. The Republican promised
this long ago.
Tho lid goes on today. Chief Rris
hois says it will stay on so long us he
has official backing in keeping it on.

Mr. Cabrera explained that a mone

obtain financial backing, chiefly from
Mexican sources, to support the
scheme.
This explanation was given after the
American members had asked to be
enlightened on the order suspending
the two institutions. Mr. Cabrera said
the two banks had issued bank notes

HEAVY BATTLES
IN PROGRESS ON
TS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
There is a pause in the fighting in
the Somme region, due to the inclement
weather, but heavy battles are in prog
ress on the eastern front in Russia,
Gallcia, Transylvania and Rumania and
on the southern front in Macedonia.
Along the Stokhod river, Germans
and Austro-Hungarians have taken the
offensive against Prussians, and, ac
cording to Berlin, near Zarecze have
crossed the river in pursuit of their
retreating foe and have captured
thirty-one officers and 2511 men and
seventeen machine guns. Here four
lines of Russian trenches were pene
trated by the Teutonic allies, says
Vienna.
In Galicia, a counter attack by tho
forces of the central powers along the
Narayuvka river, southeast of Lem
berg, brought a further success to their
armies and resulted in the capture of
an additional 4200 men.
In the Ludowa region of the Car
pathians. Russians have gained some
new positions.
The war chancellories at Berlin, So
fia and Vienna record victories for the
Teutonic allies over the Rumanians in
Transylvania and Dobrudja. In south
ern Transylvania, near Hatszeg, ac
cording to Berlin, invading Rumanians
have been repulsed and are being pur
sued by the Austro-Germans, while in

Conscription For Ireland
LONDON. Sept. 19. The applica
tion of conscription to Ireland is sug
gested by the Daily Mail today in an.
article calling attention to the urgent
necessity for obtaining more men for
the army. The newspaper suggests
two other methods for adding to tho
army, namely, the raising of the age
limit from 41 to 45 years and tha
combing out of the young men from
exempted occupations, of whom it
estimates there are 1,250,000 physi
cally fit who have not yet been draft
ed into the army.
The Times' military correspondent,
discussing the same problem, says:
"There can be only one rule for the
allies, namely, to place in the field
every aide bodied man that we can
ira:
"The time has arrived for drastic
reform in the administration in the
service acts and if this action is not
taken quickly- Germany will beat us
in organizing her man-power.
"Compulsion for Ireland is neces
sary if the Irish divisions are to bo
maintained. As to Great Britain mis.
ing the age limit it is not pressingly
needed until three or four million men
ensconced in civil occupations and.
sheltered from service have been
combed out."
The Daily Telegraph Ray's the gov
ernment is about to appoint a com
mission for the special purpose o
this combing out, of which Austen
Chamberlain will be the chairman.
