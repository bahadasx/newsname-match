*s
And the Members Lived In
the Height of
Luxury
CHICAGO, Sept. 20.?Federal eecret
service men claimed today that
as a result of the rarest of Ave men
and three women here they will break
up a syndicate composed of beautiful
women and handsome men who have
been operating an amazing black
mall scheme and secured more than
a million dollars from wealthy men
and women of society.
It is claimed that evidence unearthed
here will lead to location of blackmailers
who form a part of the syndicate
with headquarters in New York
and Philadelphia.
The authorities say the syndicate
Is composed of 40 men and 20 women,
who live in the height of luxury, dress
like millionalrcj and play the parta
of millionaires with success.
In the apartments where arrests
were made here, the secret service
men found many pictures of men and
women in compromising positions.
These pictures, it Is .id, wore to be
used by the blackmailers to force tribute
fror the persons trapped.
Prices paid for silence on the part
of the blackmailers after "suckers''
had been trapr -1, ranged from $5000
to $40,000.
One man whose tribute to the syndicate
is said to have been $40,000. is
described by the secret service men
as a New York millionaire, married
with two daughters in society and living
in a Fifth-avenue mansion.
This case, say the authorities, is
typical of the way, the blackmailers
work.
The millionaire went to Atlantic
City for a week-end. He met a beautiful,
lavishly gowned woman. Surf
dips, dinners and theater visits followed.
As they moved about, they
were followed by two dapper young
men. They went to a New York hotel.
They were not in their room long
before the two men entered. It was
agreed that $44,OOP would be paid for
the silence of the woman and two
nfeit. -"'
A Philadelphia society woman IS
said to have been trapped by one of
the handsome men of the syndicate,
led into an embarrassing situation and
mulcted for $3600.
Among those arrested are a man
called Dr. Edward Donahue and Mrs.
Edward Donahue, said by the secret
service men to be the "master minds"
who directed the operations of the
syndicate.

City Health Officer Dr. C. M.

is now being carried on in this community.

The purpose of thiB meeting is prl- 11
marily to re-organize the local organ- J
lzation and affiliate with tho National J
Red Cross society. Flans for the fur- L
ther development of the work here 11
will be made and the nurse will now
take up all cases in the city that are
in need of a visiting nurse.
The local league has in the past

dollars in educational and preventive
measures (or the tuberculosis work,
and by their efforts have reduced the
prevalence o( tuberculosis more than
lltty per cent. All o( this expense has
been borne by the few members ot
this league. Tbey have brought to
this city on two occasions a tuberculosis
exhibit which has been o( great

as to the cause, care and cure of tuberculosis.
The Board of A ft. Irs of the city
have recognized the importanci of
this work and are now contributing
$300 per year to the support of the
Red Cross Nurse. The leaders in the
local association are now planning to
extend the scope of the work and It Is
thought that as many as three nurses
could be used to advantage In this
county. MIbs Voak at present has
confined her service to the city and
the demands on her time now make
it almost impossible for her to reach
all who are In need of nursing. A

Comment
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
HUNTINGTON,. W.Va.. Sept 20.?
1 Is being made evident that In Cabell
ounty, where Abe Lilly received a
irge vote, his friends are not to be
aught by the Insidious bait set by
Ir. Cornwell, in the form of a letter
rhlch Is being sent to every man In
he state known to have voted for
,llly in the primary. This letter foljwb:
Mr. A. H. Earls,
Huntington, W. Va.
My Dear 8lr:
This letter Is written to you
because I believe you think more
of your state tban of any political
party. Because I believe you agree '
with me that the state government
and Republican party in West Virginia
have fallen under control of
an office-holding trust, a political
machine. I believe further,
you know that if I am elected governor
I will strive to restore the
government of the state to the
people, eliminate waste, stop useless
expenditures, and thereby lessen
the Amount of-money taken
from the people annually for state
purposes.
Frankly and openly, I want your
support, provided of course, you
believe the alms mentioned are
desirable.
I would be glad to hear from
you.
Very sincerely yours,
JOHN J. CORNWELL.
In reply to this letter, Mr. Earls
Ites the following significant facts:
"It Is true that I supported Abe Lll7
In the primary. He was my peronal
choice, and for the course I took
have no apology to offer. I was
ery earnest in my support of Lilly,
ut In supporting him I was merely
xpressing a preference between two
lepublican candidates. So, when he
onceded Judge Robinson's nomlnaIon
and declared that-he would suport
him, there was but one course
)ft for me as a Republican, and that
ras to support the nominee of my
arty. While men count for much in
olltlcs, principles count for even
lore. I have 'voted the Republican
Icket in both state and nation
388. The Incompetency, and egtravaance
of the Wilson administration
rove conclusively that'I.have been
ight In national politics,, and the
plendid record of . the Republican parj
In West .Virginia amply lustlflea
ly. course In the state. We have , a
plendld candidate for governor, a
trong, clean, fair-minded man who Is
bove criticism. We have a good tickt
all the way through.
"Mr. Corn well may talk of waste and
xtravaganve and of a desire to.retore
government to the .people But
le action of the -Democratic .party fa
i thoroughly at variance with the pro3
salons of Its luadwfcehht.we know
ley do not rassw WB?CO?hy say. We
nnemberthat'ln 1912 the Democrats
eclared against Republican waste and
xtravagance and against useless ofIces.
They made their campaign
pon that Issue. What was the resnltT

Chairman Earl Smith ot the River
Traffic committee ot the Fairmont

on the Monongahela would accommodate
their boats and that provided
enough freight could be obtained In
this region to pay they would operate
boats between here and Pittsburg. The
Steamer Ruth which is now on a trip
from Parkersburg will be sent up the
Monongahela on her return.
A committee to call upon local shippers
and see what may be done in the
way of obtaining freight for this line
was appointed by Chairman Smith
upon receipt of the letter. These men
are A. C. Lyons and W. H. Spedden,
who are at work today. This subcommittee
hope to have their report ready
for a meeting ot the River Traffic committee
which will be held Friday at
which a report will be made to the
packet company at Pittsburg.
The agent of the Ohio and Kanawha
co.npany at Pittsburg is H. C. Donnally

five steam packets on these two rivers.
