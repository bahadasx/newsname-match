London, Sept 20. Greece has sent
an urgent note to Germany, demand
ing the releaae of the Greek troops

It was officially announced at Ber
lin several day ago that the Fourth
Greek army corps, stationed at
Kavala, had placed themselves In the
bands of the Germans after the Bul
garian Invasion began because they
lacked food and were cut off from
communication with Athena by the
allies. .
They were transported Into Ger
many with their families, said a later
Berlin dispatch, where they are to re
ceive the same treatment as other
neutrals until allied troops are no
longer on Greek soil.
English correspondents asserted
that only a few hundred Greeks re
mained at Kavala and that these were
captured by the Germans. The pro
ally party In Greece used the affair to
renew their agitation for Greece's en
try Into the war and urged the gov
ernment to send an ultimatum o Ger
many. '

AMERICA FIRST!
' IS HUGHES PLEA
Green Bay, Wls.j Sept. 20. Speak
ing to audiences In Wisconsin towns
which were for the most part of Ger
man . stock. Republican Nominee
Hughes today pleaded for "America
first" and for an America "that has
no secret understandings, no covert
Intrigues, but demands that its just
rights be recognized as to lives, prop
erty and commerce." .
All this was the nearest the G. O. P.
candidate came to dlscussinjr the
"hyphen question." But his audiences
read into his phrases detailing the
position he would take In demanding
recognition or ngnts as to "com
merce" a direct slap at the position
the Wilson administration has taken
on the British Interference with
American malls.
Hughes did not mention Wilson by
name, nor connect the administration
with his reference, but this was plain
ly what was meant. In previous
speeches Hughes . has frequently
pleaded for full recognition of Ameri
can rights as to lives and property,
but today was the first time that he
added the significant word "com
merce" to this phrase.
Wisconsin turned out big to wel
come the candidate. He has had no
better audiences anywhere ' in his
journey than those at Sheboygan,
Manltowoo and here.
At Manitowoc, after Hughes had
spoken, a change of engines held his
private car at the etatlon. Crowds
massed about It and finally the candi
date clambered down from the plat
form and yelled for them to come and
get acquainted. , In the meantime,
Mrs. Hughe's came out and shook
hands from the platform with the wo
men in the audience, patting babies
and doing Just as good a Job of
mingling as her husband.
