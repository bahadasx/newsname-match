JAPANESE COMIC OPERA
Friday Night at School Audi?
torium. Home Talent Pro?
duction. Auspices Civic
League.
No moro interesting and de
lightful event in t!u> form of
pure and instructive entertain?
ment could be devised titan tho
forthcoming production of Gil?
bert and Sullivan's famous Eng
lish-Japaneso (!6mic (Ipora, The
.Mikado, to be given Friday
night at the High School Audi?
torium by a company of select?
ed homo talent sinners, under
the auspices of the Civic League
of Hig Stone Gap.
The music of The Mikado is
'of its kind a classic, the wit
contained in the lyrics, and
speaking lines of a high order,
containing a fund on continu?
ous "merriment" situations are
very funny, and have boenen
? joyed by more thousands of pa?
trons than any opera ever writ
Iten. The action of the opera is
spiritetl and vivacious to the
I extreme, not a dull moment in
the whole production.
The cast of characters has
been well chosen, the choruses
well balanced and effective.in
.singing and acting, and the
special numbers being done by
I children and misses from 0 to
10, are worth the price of ad?
mission, and have only to bo
seen to be appreciated.
I There will be a chorus of
j Japaneso Maids, Lilliputians,
I Cowboy Girls, and a group of
Pan ami Flower Uirls in special
acts, which are unique and
delightfully pleasing, and are
all along the lines of general
culture and full of merit of their
kind.

The performance of the Mika?
do is in every way worthy of
patronage by the good citizens
of our vicinity, in an artistic
sense, and deserves a well tilled
house, along the lines of encour?
agement for things beautiful,
at the same time, aside from
? fact that it is being given
under the auspices of our Civic
League, which has for its at?
tainment continued live issues
in the betterment of conditions
relative to our community and
city interests.
A prize of $5.00 is to be given
to the holder of the lucky mini
her ticket, to bo drawn from tho
box at the Friday night per?
formance. Some one is going
to get this prize. It may be
yourself. Come and see tho
opera; get your money's worth
in a good show, and possibly
draw the prize.
Saturday night will bo Chil?
dren's Night, and the price for
children will be 25 cents, with
a chance of a $5 00 prize also.
REVENUE OFFICERS MUST
GO IT ALONE.
A large number of revenue
officers were dropped from the
service in Virginia during J lily,
and recently the few remaining
officers received an order from
the internal rovenuo depart?
ment that henceforth nothing
would bo paid informers for
showing up illicit stills and
that nothing would bo paid
possemen for going with ollieora
on raids. This action was tak?
en, we suppose, because Vir?
ginia is going dry, and as there
will bu no bonded distilleries or
saloons in tho Stato tho Gov?
ernment wilt have nothing to
protect in the way of revenue.
This virtually moans that the
Federal authorities will aban
tlou raiding and as a result we
may expoct within the next
year to see tho smoke from
hundreds of stills making
spirals toward the clouds.?

Cut The Weeds
The following from the Bris?
tol llonild Courier aptly applies
lo every town und community
iu the country and the advice
should he complied with by
every family:
There arc too many weeds in
Bristol. They are nourishing
iu vacant lots, back yards and
gardens, They are attaining
rank growth here, there, und
almost everywhere. They
blight to be cut to the ground.
W eeds should not lie allowed
tu grow to maturity and go to
seed because they disseminate
aisease germs, hike dies, weeds
formerly were regarded merely
as a nuisance. Flies were kill
. .1 ami homes were screened
against the n .because they
i\ere a pestiferous insect, and
when weeds worn cut it was
because they were unsightly,
lint suieuco has demonstrated
that both tlies and weeds are
not only nuisance, but menaces
to health, and is t ime the public
realized that unrelenting war
should he made on both.
The responsible authorities in
many cities, alive to the im?
portance of such matters, are
requiring the people to cut tho
weed si The responsible authori?
ties of the two Bristols would
make no mistake in taking like
action. Whether the law ex?
pressiv invests the .Mayor of
any city with power to compel
the cutting of weeds is u qiies
iinn upon which we are not in?
formed, but common souse sug?
gests that a .Mayor may take
the necessary stops to ab dish
any recognized public nuisance
or menace to the public health.
The season is hero when
weeds begin to get in their
work. From now on until the
frosts kill them they will bo
throwing off the germs uf di?
sease. The city authorities
should require that Duty be cut
without delay, whether they
are growing in yards or gardens
or vacant lots. And the authori?
ties should take the load in tho
work by cutting tho weeds in
some of the streets in the roei
deuce districts.
Voting man, the road to
wealth and fume does not lie
through idleness on street
corners. Successful men aro
never found there, and men
who have made names and for
; tunes for themselves were not
found thoro in thoir youth.
