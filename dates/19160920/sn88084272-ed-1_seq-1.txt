Brands It Increase in Pay
For Part of Eailroaders
at Public Expense.
Springfield. Ills., Sept. 10 Charles H.
Hughes was applauded and cheered
loudly by a great crowd here Tuesday
night when he denounced the Adam
son law for railroad employes in the
operating department, granting them
an eight hour day which he brande
as a mere increase in wages at public
expense. He called the president's in
sistence that the bill pass congress as
a consideration of immediate political
expediency at the expense of public
welfare.
Adnmson Hill a Farce- Rill.
Mr. Hughes, after declaring that "the
just interests of labor are the concern
of all." and asserting that he desired
to see safe and wholesome conditions
of work, adequate opportunities for ed
ucation and recreation, reasonable
hours of labor and fair wages, said In
part:
"The Adamson bill is a farce bill. It
was legislation without inquiry, with
out knowledge. The demand by the
administration for such legislation as
the price of peace was a humiliating
spectacle It was not only a serious
misuse of official power, but a deplor
able abdication of moral authority.
11 Admit Legislation Hasty.
"Within a few hours on demand of
the aministration. congress provided
a mandatory increase in wages, involv
ing millions of dollars, without any
idea whether the increase was or was
not justified. And this action was tak- j
en in connection witn tne essential
instrumentality of commerce, the ar
teries of nnr commercial life.

"The excuses presented are futile.
The Adamson bill is not a bill pro
viding for an eight hour work day.
It does not fix hours at alL It regu
lates wages Its provisions do not re
quire any employer to employ any
set of men for only eight hours a day.

Mr. Hughes quoted the Adamson law.
showing, he said "in plain English
that the men affected are not required
to work fewer hours but are to have
ten hours' pay for eight hours work
with aditional pay for additional hours.
Why Limited To a I'tnf
"We are. therefore, not concerned
with anything that Is said of the judg
ment of society with respect to an
eight hour workday. There Is plainly
no judgment of society upon the in
crease of wages this bill requires.
"If the asserted Judgment of society
Inspired it, why does the act apply only
to a limited number of railroad men.
relatively few? The obvious fact is
that there was a demand by certain
men for an Increase In their own
wages, and the administration in ad

this demand.'

this burden must ultimately fall on

"It was proposed In substance by the
administration that increased rates

the Overseas News agency estimates.
"Recent local successes obtained by
the British on the Somme are heralded
by the English press as great victories
and even occasioned a special message
from king George to the British com
mander. Gen sir Douglas Halg." says
the news agency "It is said the Brit

been planned to take them In the course
of four days" battle
Gains Are Relatively Small.
"Nevertheless, the British were en
abled to make this advance only after
11 -weeks of the most desperate efforts.
The result of the battle of the Somme
should be gaged by considering the
amount of French and Belgian terri
tory occupied by the Germans which
amounts, in all. to about 50.000 square
kilometers. Of this 29,000 is Belgian
and 21.000 French The efforts made
by the French and British have re
sulted in the reconquest of only 1500
square kilometers or three percent
The price paid for this territory is
appalling. According to a conservative
estimate the British lost 35.OO0 men
up to September 15. This, together
with the French losses brings up the
total to about half a million men."

"We now have a European army with
