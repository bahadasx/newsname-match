TO LENGTHEN THE LIFE
OF THE BINDER.
A binder left in the field from one
season to another will last at best
three or four years, whereas, with
proper care a binder should do good
work for ten, fifteen, or even twenty
years. The same kind of thing may
be said of almost all farm imple
ments.
Before long, winter will be here,
levying its tax upon farm imple
ments left in the open. This is the
time, therefore, to make plans for
housing farm machinery.
The saving in the value of machin
ery in one year will almost pay for
the cost of a good machine shed.

Mrs. Iver Iverson, of Alvarado,
Passes Away Last Evening in
This City.
After entering the shadow of the
valley of death and giving life to a
well born 11-pound baby boy, the
mother, Mrs. Iver Iverson, of Alva
rado, failed to return from that nar
row border land where life and death
meet in close proximity, and gave
her own life for the perpetuation of
the race. She was taken to the Miss
Nordgren home in this city on Mon
day in anticipation of her confine
ment, and on Tuesday morning she
was taken ill. After a painful
parturition the baby was born at
five o'clock in the afternoon and
everything appeared to be all right.
Shortly after 7:30 o'clock her sick
ness took a sudden turn for the
worse, and she failed so rapidly that
within ten minutes she breathed her
last Her age was 39 years.
The death of Mrs. Iverson has cast
a deep gloom over the entire viPage
of Alvarado and country tributary
thereto, where she had grown to
womanhood ,and was highly esteemed
by a large circle of friends. Her
maiden name was Miss Hannah
Smith, her parents being Mr. and
Mrs. John G. Smith, honored
pioneer residents of this com
munity. Before her marriage she
taught for a number of years in
the rural schools of the county. Mrs.
Iverson was a good, noble woman
and a sincere Christian. She was
an active member of the Swedish
Lutheran church at Alvarado and
took gx*eat interest in its Ladies' Aid
and the furthering of all good and
charitable work in the community.
She is immediately mourned by the
grief stricken husband, Mr. Iver
Iverson, and four young children, in
cluding the baby whose bringing into
life cost the mother so much. She
is also mourned by her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. John G. Smith, the hus
band's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Peter
Iverson, and many other relatives
and a large circle of friends. May^
the consolation of all who mourn be
that she, who has departed, has gone
to claim a higher and more perfect
life on the ether shore and that she
will be a link that will bind them
more closely to heaven.
The funeral will be held in Alva
rado at 2 o'clock on Thursday after
noon.
DITCH VIEWERS ON THE JOB.
Protest Against Damaging Lateral
Given Full Consideration.
Wm. Forsberg, of Warren, H. A.
Larson, of Big Woods, and J. Cook,
of Argyle, came over to Middle Ri
ver last Thursday in Mr. Cook's
Ford and are engaged in the work
of viewing county ditch No. 28. They
are giving full heed to the protests
of Andrew Olson, the editors and
others against the emptying of a
branch into lateral No. 1 of State
Ditch No. 83, so it is possible that
that lateral will be left out of the
system. They inform us that they
will report conditions exactly as
they are as to the insufficient out
let of the proposed branch emptying
into Ditch No. 83. Then it will be
up to the county commissoners and
the engineer to say whether or not
the branch shall be put in to add to
the flooding land owners along dich
No. 83 are being subjected to.Mid
