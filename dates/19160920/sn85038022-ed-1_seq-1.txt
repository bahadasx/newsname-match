Springfield, III.. September 1
Charles K. Hughes, addressing an au
dience In Ihe arsenal here tonight re
newed his attack on the administration
for the passage of the Adamson Inw
In the faeo of the threateind railroad
sirike. Mr. Hughes discussed and
called "futile'' reasons advocated for
the passage, quoted froni President
Wilson's address to Congress on the
subject, challenged the statement of
Kepresentative Adamson that it was
passed to meet an emergency and cited
a declaration attributed to Grover
Cleveland In support of the contention
that the law wns a "surrender to j
force."
Mr. Hughes spoke before a crowded
1. 1. use His speech tonight was his
second In Springfield. The first at the
Slate Fair ground this afternoon,
dealt chiefly with his ideas on protec
tion of American industries, American
rights and prepnredness. He also
touched tonight on the protection of
American rights.
"Tho America of which I have a
vision, the America of the future. Is
an American maintaining American
rights 'in land and esa without fear
or favor throughout the world."
Mr Hughes left Springfield at 11
p. m., for Milwaukee. He will reach
there tomorrow night and will deliver
six speeches en route.
