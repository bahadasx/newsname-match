JOHNSTON LETTER.
School Has Auspicious Opening
Methodist Revival Services.
W. C. T. U. Meeting
Held at Mrs. Waters.
The high school opened on last
Monday and another year's work
was begun with the brightest pros
pects that have ever Quirked an open
ing.and this promises to be cneof the
lirgest and most enthusiastic periods
of the school so tar in its history.
The fact that the school is of a high
standard is shown by the number of
pupils not residents that have en
tered. The opening exercises were
short but exceedingly interesting,
the devotional being conducted by
Rev. W. S. Brooke, which was'fol
lowed by a good talk by Rev. J.
H. Thacker. A short address on
"The needs of the school," was
made by Rev. M. L. Kester and as
he taught several months last year
in the school he was well qualified
to speak on this subject. Superin
tendent W. F. Scott also addressed
. the student ' body and the patrons
and friends present, outlining his
plans for the year and asked for the
co-operation of all for the success
of the school depended on this
which is the keynote of success.
The corps of teachers with Prof.
Scott are, Misses Eva Rushton,
Gertrude Strother, Daisy Brocking
ton, Clara Sawyer, Sallie Heyward,
Mrs. Ona Denny Reese, Mrs. L. C.
Latimer, Miss Anna Harms, Mrs.
Mamie Huiet. Music and art, Prof.
John Waters. The Johnston high
school is rated with the highest
number of units of any high school
in the state offering one course of
study and the standing of t he school
has enabled it to secure for the
graduates in the last four years,
scholarships amounting to over
?2,000. The school plant is one of
the be*t in the state, soma of the
outside features being beneficial
r^^TSzvi?l an? rausi?* and literary
- entertainments by the pupils and
the teachers.
Dr. B. L. Allen bas been unite
sick since his return from Green
! ville and is still confined to his bed.
His mother, Mrs. Bettie Ailen, and
sister, Mrs. Mary Ashley have been
with him for a few days.
Mrs. Bonknight has been visiting
her niece, Mrs. J. W. Marsh. The
past week was spent at Saluda with
'her son, Editor Grady Hazel of the
Saluda Standard.
Mr. Ben Stevens 'of Meeting
Street visited in the home of Mr.
J. R. Hart during the week-end.
Mrs. M. M. Stewart of Chester
is visiting her daughter, Mrs. F.
M. Boyd.
Mrs. Sallie Merchant has returned
to Saluda after a visit to relatives.
Messrs. Pickens and Ben Kinard
of Ninety Six visited in the nome
o? Mr. and Mrs. P. N. Lott for the
week-end.
The protracted services which
have been in progress for the past
two weeks at the Methodist church
have been a means of great spirit
ual help to all who have been under
the sound of the gospel. Durinsr the
first week Rev. Mr. Peele of Lees
ville assisted the pastor Rev. J. H.
Thacker, and later, Rev. J. B. Ma
haffey, of Columbia preached. Sev
eral have joined the church and on
next Sunday morning the ordinance
of baptism will be administered.
The last meeting of the W. C.
T. U. was held with Mrs. P. B.
Waters, Jr., and was in celebration
f the first anniversary of the day
South Carolina went dry September
14. This date has been set aside as
a Red Letter Day and should al
ays be a day of special thanksgiv
ing and rejoicing and is a happy
day. The meeting was opened with
"America", Mrs. T. R. Denny con
ducting the devotional. Mrs. A. P.
Lewn made prayer in thanks for
the victory and that prohibition
would early gain full sway. During
the business session the delegates
were elected to the state convention
at Sumter, September 28. Mesdames
J. A. Lott, A. P. Lewis and P. N.
Lf>tt were elected delegates and
Mesdames T. R. Denny and Olin
Eidson and Miss Zena Payne, as
officers, will also attend, so this un
ion will be well represented. Mrs.
O. D. Black as superintendent of
flower mission gave her annual re
port which showed that much beau
tiful work had been done. Follow
ing business Miss Eva Rushton
made a most interesting talk on
r.1 1 in
A Statement From Supervisor
Edmunds.
To the Voters of Edgefield County:
Gentlemen: Since the election of
last Tuesday, as Bill Arp would
say, I have been "ruminating" over
something to write, but the more I
"ruminate" the less I think of wri
ting anything. However, since
meeting with so many people, some
of whom seemed to be more disap
pointed at ray defeat than myself,
I feel that it is my duty to say for
ray friends' consolation that 'such
is politics."
And now let me say to those that
voted for me, I certainly am grate
ful, and to those that did not: I
certainly can excuse-but to those
that went out and fought me wrong
fully I shall never forget! But it is
all over now, and it is just another
reminder that no supervisor with
the present facilities of working
roads and the increased desire for
better roads, can do his duty and
succeed himself as supervisor. Let
us hope, however, that the newly
elected supervisor will give such
satisfaction that no one will op
pose him four years hence. As to
what I shall do another year 1 have
not fully decided. I may take old
Ab Clark's proposition: A few days
ago he walked up to me and said
"If you will go back down on your
lower place and go to farming I
will lend you Si,OOO to do business
with next year God, you'd better
take my "icviee"-you gwine fool
about here and let politics ruin you
yit," so
Then what's the use of pining
Where there's a will there's a way,
Tomorrow the sun may be shining,
Altho' its cloudy to-day.
(All join in the chorus.)
A. A. EDMUNDS.

RED OAK GROVE.
Writes Interestingly of Farming.
Visited Good Farms in This
and Aiken Counties.
Children Rehearse.
Continuous picking and hauling
away the cotton will soon bring
that industry to close in this section.
Good prices for cotton and extor
tionate prices on provisions, so it
makes something of hard times for
the farmer. Trust on everything
now even on eggs so we learn.
Could the farmers conclude to raise
as near as possible everything for
home consumption, keeping good
garden the year around is a big
start. Speculation would soon starve
and let the farmers rest some then.
Our farmers are talking now,
keep up with working peas, as well
as cotton. By this we conclude they
are gradually learning by hard
knocks both the importance and ad
vantages obtained thereby.
We have recently seen some of
the splendidly conducted farms near
Johnston and down in Aiken coun
ty near North Augusta. Corn is
lovely to behold, now ready to be
gathered, also the fields of fine pea
hay ready stacked for baling. We
were told most of it is baled on the
field. We noted in Aiken county
the velvet beans in many of the
fields. We believe that both are an
advantage and profit, in that soil.
While on our trip last week we
saw our good friend Mr. Milledge
Horne. He has lost in flesh yet not
in good spirits and patriotism. We
enjoyed finding him so well satis
fied and submissive to the will of
an all'wise Father. So feelingly did
he mention the kind thoughtfulness
of his neighbors. During our stop
wesaw Mrs. Eldred Barton, meeting
Mr. Barton also. They too had good
things to say for Mt. Zion folks and
the beloved pastor Rev. P. B. Lan-.
ham. We regret to ^learn^ the^cii.n-i
rh??ea^a?r?ngh^?tW Mrs. Sue
Mays Garner, one of Mt. Zion's
oldest members.
Mrs. J. N. Griffis bas returned
home after quite a pleasant sojourn
among friends in and around Edge
field. She and Mr. Grirlis are being
congratulated by their friends which
they humbly appreciate.
Rev. Pat Bussey and wife with
their little son, Thaxton, are guests
of Mrs. Mamie Bussey. Miss Mamie
Bussey expects to leave for Lime
stone to enter collage there this
week. Also Miss Ruth Timmerman
will go to Tubman high school in
Augusta. We wish them every suc
cess in their work.
Our Sunday school cordially in
vites every one especially those who
have not arranged exercise in their
school, to come be with us Sunday
the 24th.
We were glad to have in our
midst yesterday Miss Lola Young
from Red Hill also Mr. Dewey Mc
Clendon.
After a long drive Saturday we
felt tired but soon forgot that
l;eing invited to dine with Mr. and
Mrs. Charlie Parkman. Home cured
ham and ice cream not made of
cold storage eggs but our farmers
hen eggs was part of the well pre
pared dinner. Soon 2 o'clock came
the hour appointed to meet Mrs.
Fannie Griffis and our children at
the church for rehearsal for our
exercises next Sunday. We thank
the parents who kindly sent us their
children.
Work Day For Orphanage.
Attention once more is called to
the Orphanage Work Day that has '
been announced for September 30
Dext. Appeals have gone out from
the various insv-itutions to Sunday- ?
Behool superintendents and all oth- ,
ers who are likely to be interested ,
in the project. Emphasis might
be given to the fact that Sunday- ,
?chool and church people are not |
the only ones who could take part j
in such a deserving work. The ,
destitute and helpless orphan should ,
ippeal to every individual within ,
our State. Contributions may te j
sent to any institution that one may ,
prefer. It certainly looks as if any
person might afford to give one ,
lay out of the year as Labor Day
for the orphan children and con
tribute the results of the day, or (
Lhe income of the day, to their care t
ind training. It is to be hoped j
that thousands and thousands of j
our people will co-operate in the -
Work Day effort.
"UNCLE" IV WRITES.
Rejoiced Over Governor Man
ning's E!oction. Gives Good
?dvL \ to Newly Mar
ried Couples.
Dear Advertiser:
Can I holler hurrah all right?
Hurrah for South Carolina and
Georgia. Manning governor of
South Carolina and Dorsey gov
ernor of Georgia, and Ben Tillman
still alive. Nuff sed.
Wellj Capt. Tom Getzen of Flor
ida and his daughters Sallie and
Maude snd Maude's husband, Dr.
Adams, of Plum Branch, S. C.,
took dinner with me Thursday. A
rare treat it was, too, for I was glad
to see all of them, and a little more
than glad to see Cousin Tom. Yes,
we are brother and sister's children,
and I always feel better after being
with and talking with him. He
will be eighty years old some time
in next month.
While he was here I told him I
intended writing an incident in his
father's (Rev. S. P. Getzen) life as
it was told me fifty years ago by
his father.
A shortwhile after I was married,
in 1866, uncle Sam came to see my
mother andflmyself and little wife,
Sallie. - We were living in the
home with my mother (and no man
ever had a better one), and just af
ter dinner we were all sitting out
on the piazza, and Uncle Sam turned
to my wife and asked: 'Can you
cook?'' "Yes, sir," she said. "Can
you wash and iron clothes?" ''Yes,
sir." "Can you milk the cows?"
"Yes, sir, if they are gentle." Then
turning to me he said: "Well,
Evan, I don't think you have made
a mistake in getting Sal!; for a
wife, and now," be said. "I aT ~"
". ww^^tuiiig to you
that he should not say, just bear it,
forbear saying anything in reply."
Then to me he said: "You do the
same." To-day I am thankful to
him for his advice; but that was not
all he said, but told of an iucideut
that took place between a man and
his wife. He said: 'A man and
bis wife were sitting in a room to
gether and something ran across the
floor, and the wife said, did you see
that, mouse run across tbe fioor?aud
the husband said, no, but I saw a
rat, and the wife said it was a
mouse, and he replied, but I tell
you it was a rat, and she replied
mouse, mouse! and he said rat, rat!
And from that thj wife said to her
husband* I am going back to my
daddy's, and back she went. After
she was gone the husband begun to
think how foolish it was in both of
them, and he put on his bat and
went over to bis wife's father's, and
said to his wife: 'Look, here, it is
very foolish in you to leave me
about a rat,' and she replied: 'It
was a mouse, I tell you,' and again
io was mouse, mouse, rat, rat. Back
home went the husband, but he was
miserable, and finally he said to him
self: 'Well, let it be a mouse, I
must have my wife to come back
home.' Again he went for hiswife,
and told her that he thought it verv
foolish in both of them, and said to
her, 'Let it be a mouse/ and her re- !
ply was, 'Let it be a rat,' and after
that all went went well."
Now, old uncle, if Sallie says 'tis
a, mouse, you say let it be a mouse,
?nd Sallie if Evan says 'tis a rat let
it be a rat.
"That is the way that your aunt
Polly (my wife) and I do. If she
jays 'tis a mouse, I say let it be a
mouse; and if I say 'tis a rat she
aays well let it be a rat."
Of my own knowledge Uncle Sam
ind Aunt Polly did that way, and a
iiappier couple I never knew. This
ihey learned from the mouse and
rat trouble, and I am very much
if raid that there ar* husbands and
,vives to-day that need to learn the 1
esson taught by the incident of rat '
ind mouse.
After telling the above be told of :
in incident in his own life when a 1
,-ounir man. He said:
"Living a few miles from my \
laddy's there was a young woman
,hat was very pretty, and 1 thought 1
[ was dead in love with her, and 1
1er father was going to move away 1

of the season, according to how
much pleasure it afforded.

STOP THE FIRST COLD I
A cold does not get well of it

cold wears you out, and your cough
becomes serious if neglected. Hack
ing coughs drain the energy and (
sap the vitality. For 47 years the <
happy combination of soothing: an- 1
Liseptic balsams in Dr. Kint 's New i
Discovery has healed coughs and |
relieved congestion. Young and e

Go-to-Sunday-SchooI Day to be
Observed. Enjoyed Auto
Trip to Greenwood. Mr.
Leggat Leaves.
We hope everybody will go to
Sunday school next Sunday, which
will be State-wide Baptist Go-to
Sunday-Scbool day, a great rally
day for children and grown-ups.
Those of you who were Sunday
school goers and workers some years
ago decide this week that you will
come back and bring an old friend
with you. Let each school try to
make an extra contribution to State
missions.
Miss Mary Bell left this week
for Coker college and John Dallas
Bunch leaves this week for Green
wood to enter the B. M. I.
Mrs. H. E. Bunch was in Au
gusta a few days last week visiting
friends and relatives. While there
she met up with Mrs. Ethel Hughes
Timm of Hepzibah, Ga., and with
a heart as big as grandfather D. W.
Sharpton, she would take no ex
cuse so she carried Mrs. Bunch out
to her lovely borne. Mrs. Bunch
reports that joy and happiness are
with them.
Mr. W. M. Rowland was up a
few days last week at his Melrose
plantation.
Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Fouche, with
Miss Lilla Bunch, came up Satur
day morning and took dinner with V
Mr. and Mrs. S. T. Adams, and af
ter resting a while took us in their
car and motored to Greenwood.
My what a good time we did have!
We stopped at Plum Branch for
cool water at the home of Dr. J. B.
Adams, finding all at home and
well. WP--'-J . "
reached Greenwood at five o'clock,
and were glad to see old Edgefield
in the persons of Will Cogburn and
Calhoun Mays.
Sunday morning we attended Sun
day school and preaching at the
South Main Street Baptist church.
Here we met and saw more Edge
field people doing good work, Miss
Madge Mays and the Smith twins.
We were glad to see these girls.
Mr. Will Nixon, an old Clark's
Hill man, and quite a number of
leading church workers are from
Edgefield county. This church has
nine deacons and four of them, F.
N. K. Bailey, W. H. Yeldell, J.
M. Gaines and A. E. Adams, are
from the old mother county. Cal
houn Mays is auditor of the church
and Prof. J. F. Entzminger direc
tor of music. This made our heart
glad and I know it will be a joy to
others to know that dear old Edge
field men aud women, when they
are cut off from the old county,
continue the Master's work.
Monday morning thc streets were
alive with bright young faces, as all
public schools opened on that day.
The B. M. I. boys and Lander girls
are expected in by Tuesday night.
We went over to the B. M. I. this
morning and found Col. Bailey,
Prof. Entzminger and Capt. Cain
moving around as if by gas.
Lake Middleton, the little daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Middle
ton, was bitten by a snake last
week. She did not suffer very much
from it and is doing nicely this
week.
Our whole neighborhood was
saddened this morning on account
of the leaving of our beloved Chris
tian friend, Mr. W. R. Leggat. He
bas gone to Temple, Texas, where
he will be with his wife and two
laughters. We hate to give him
up. May God bless him and his
good wife wherever they are. He
has always been a good worker in
murch, discharging every duty
placed upon him.
