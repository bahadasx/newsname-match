A6ED CITIZEN PASSES AWAY
Columbus Kearley Died Wednesday at
the Home of His Son John,
Columbus Kearley, aged 84, died at
the home of bis son, John Kearley,
near Dorton, Wednesday morning, as
the result ot a general breakdown due
to age. He had been tailing for sev
eral yearn and his death was not unex
pected. The remains were laid to rest
tn the cemtcrey here Wednesday.
The ueceased was born in Sequatchie
valley and he lived practically all his
life in this and Bledsoe counties. He
reared a family of 8? three daughters
and five sons. All the daughters are
dead and two sons also. The remain
ing sons are John, who lives near Dor
ton this county, W. 0. and M. L. Kear
ley, both ot whom now reside near
Buhl. Idaho. His wife proceeded nim
to the grave some 25 years ago or
longer.
The deceased was a member of the
M. E. church, was a man cf very
strong convictions and outspoken in his
likes and dislikes. In spite of there
being no opportunities for education
when he was a boy, he learned to read
and being an inveterate reader he ac
quired quite a store ot information.
He was gifted in pseechand took much
delight in arguing many questions that
were prominent in the public uiinp
during hiy time. He was elected coun
ty court clerk of this county in about
1869 or 1870. For many years he was
county coroner. If rve was a tiriend to
any one nothing could turn him from
that loyalty and if he was opposed to
any person he never hesitated to make
that opposition known, if occasion de
manded. He was not a soldier during
the war between the states, but W83
an unv-ompromizing union man and
voted the republican ticket all his life.
He had a marvelous intellect for one
ot his meagre opportunities and had he
been givn the advantages of the aver
age person of this day he would have
wielded a mighty force in his commu
nity. For many years he was a prom
inent figure in Crossville and he is re
membered by many here as a man who
never failed to take a position on any
important subject and always had a
reason for the faith that was in him
and that reason he was never ashamed
to state,
He ib gone, and one of the ancient
and notable landmarks ot the older
days in this section has been removed,
but it will be long before he will be
forgotten by many ot his former asso
ciates. DIED FROM AN OPERATION.
J. W. Scott, Prominent Harriman-Citizen,
Passes Away at Knoxviile
General Hospital.
J. W. Scott, brother of Mrs. G. A.
Schlicher, died in the Knoxviile Gener
al Hospital Wednesday at 3 :50 as the
result of an operation for affection of
the mastoid glands. The remains were
brought to his home in Harriman,
where they were buried with Masonic
honors.
Mrs. G. A. Schlicher was summoned
to the beside of her brother Tuesday of
last week and remained with him until
the end came Wednesday morning.
The deceased was an attorney, a mem
ber of the Christian church, a' Mason
ot high standing, was one time mayor
of Harriman, and was born near Wart
burg, Morgan county, May I, 1857, and
was in his 60th year. He was the old
est of a family of nine children born
to John L. and Perlesia Seott. He
was well known to many in this county
and was recognized as one of the lead
ing lawyers oi this section of the state.
Having had a wide experience in sur
veying and mapping the lands of sev
eral ot the mountain counties he be
came renowned authority on land titles
throughout this and several other
mountain counties.
The Harriman Record in speaking of
him said the following in part :
"The people of Harriman and
all thin section have been call
ed upon thiB week to witness
the departure from this field of
activity of one of the best men
. that the county has been able
to boast of. Joe Scott was a
man among men. tie was re
spected by all because he de
served respect. As a citizen
he was above reproach. As a
man he was all that could be
wished for. As a friend, he
was such a triend as one who
had the good fortune to have
his iriendship, had that which
was without price. As a lov
ing father and husband and
brother, there were very tew
his equal and none his superior.
"Joe Scott was born with an
instinct to see the right way
and do the right thing on the
spur of the moment. It re
quired no effort for him to do
right. He did it without
thinking of doing otherwise.
The hifagest tribute that can be
paid to any man is to say that
he was an honest man honest
not only in business relations,
but honest in all relations."
No higher tribute could be paid a
citizen and all who knew the deceased
are tree to admit that what the Record
has said was true and deserved.

her marvelous acquatic feats, which
she has many opportunities to display
In this drama, proves thai she is aiso
a splendid actress, a graceful dancer,
an expert swordswoman, and mistress
of a hundred arts which contribute to

REPUBLICANS AROUSED.
Will Open Headquarters and Make Ac
tive Canvass of the County.
Monday night a few of the leading
republicans met in the room formerly
occupied by the Cumberland Mercantile
Company and decided to perfect an ac
tive and vigorous organization for the
coming election.
There will be a large banner ttretch
ed across Mam street bearing the
words: Republican Headquarters.
Sampson DeRossett will bo at head
quarters all the tiuie, he will have
plenty of literatuie and several nation
al republican papers that will be for
the free use of these who wish to read "
thetu. It is also expected that several
prominent speakeis will address the ,
republicans of the county at Crossville
and other ponds. A thorough organi
zation of the entire county will be per
fected and an active and determined
effort made to get out the vote in the
coming election, November 7. Judging
from what we have learned from talk
ing with the republicans from all parts
of the county there will tie a more gen
eral turn out in November than for
many years.
What action the democrats will take
to forestall this action we have not
learned, but it is safe to say they will
not be found sleeping.
A CORRECTION.
Last week in speaking of the road
working the Friday before we said:
"Not a singie person wi;o owns an
automobile, with tlie-single exception
of Volner Hamby. gave any aid to the
movement." This statement was an
error and we do not know how we
came to make such a blonder other
than that the item w:is hastily written
at the last minute as we were closing
up the paper and thereby forgot to say
that Oliver Kector ati assisted with
his car. He took a iad to Dorton in
the morning and ti.;- editor of the
Chronicle was one of the number and
why we should have forgotten th9 fact
we shall never know. We regret the
error an can only say it was one of
those blunders that will come upon us
at times without any kind of an excuse.
