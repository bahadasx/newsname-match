GONE TO HER REWARD.
Mrs. C. W. Lewe, Daughter of Judge
Junius Hancock, Crosses Over
.and is at Rest, After a
Long Illness.
FUNERAL SERVICES LARGELY ATTENDED
In the departure of the subject of
this writing the people generally of
Columbia, where she was born and
reared, realized thab a beautiful life
and spotless character had gone to
meet the God she worshiped; that her
cheerful voice in the home had been
hushed, and that a deroted husband
had been bereft of the idol of Els life.
For more than a year the companioa
of her bosom kept vigil by her bedside,
quit his business, his only thought be
ing that of his beloved wife. His de
votion was beautiful, never hesitat
ing i.o do all in his power that might
possibly bring relief. Likewise Eer
father and other members of the fam
ily were interested only in her recov
ery, and every wish was gratified,
tenderest ol hands administering to
her wants dally andoiightly.
During her long illness, of twenty
months, there were days when it was
thought she was improving, and often
those wEo were near and dear -to her
felt encouraged, but the -good days
would not last, the disease continually
praying upon her system, "baffling the
skill of physicians.
During the months of her illnessshe
was up a portion of the time, walking
about the dwelling, but really she was
no better, gradually wasting, and
three weeks ago the husband and her
father's family were brought to the
realization that the time for her de
parture was fast approaching. It
came Tuesday night, September the
12th, at 11 o'clock. Her life "went out
as she had lived, peacefully, and she
was ready to meet the Giver of all that
is good.
The deceased had been a devoted
member of the Christian Church since
early girlhood, and she was thirty
years old on the 9th of last February.
In health she never failed to attend
her church services and was never
missed from the Sunday School.
She was married to Mr. Geo. W.
Lowe about eight years ago. No chil
dren came to bless the home, but they
were happy in each other's love. Up
to 4 o'clock Wednesday afternoon
friends constantly visited the home,
expressing sympathy for those who
had been so sorely stricken. May the
God of love comfort them in thehours
of their, great affl iction is the wish of
the wrioer, who knew the deceased
from infancy to the grave.
Besides the husband she is survived
by her father, lour brothers, Messrs.
W. F. Hancock, Louisville, S. N. and
Geo. W New Mexico, Henry Han
cock, Columbia, and one sister, Mrs
W. M. Wilson, also of New Mexico.
Her stepmother, who was also an
aunt, Ead much to do in rearing her,
and no mother could have been more
devoted, and no one of the family is
experiencing more grief.
The funeral services were held at
the Christian church Wednesday af
ternoon, conducted by her pastor, Eld.
Z. T. Williams, who preached a very
touching discourse to the Jiving, pay
ing high tribute to the Christian char
acter of the dead.
The floral offerings were beautiful,
and as the congregation looked upon
the white casket containing the body,

SKETCHES.
Geo. R. Miller.
This week we take up a gentleman
who has been traveling for candy
manufacturers for twenty-four years,
and as he is comparatively a joung
man now, hfs long time on the road is
an evidence thatv he commenced his
career as a wholesale salesman when a
mere boy. He starred vith Bradas &
Co., and doing good service for several
years, he accepted a position with
Frank A. Menne & Co., remaining
with this firm a number of years, his
territory covering several States. As
a ready salesman, Mr. Miller's reputa
tion became generally known, and se
curing a flattering offer from a Cin
cinnati establishment, he again made
a change, traveling for the last firm
several years, By this time he had
accumulated a snug sum, and after
due cpnsideration he concluded that if
he cotlld make money for his friends
he could do the same for himself. Ac
cordingly, three years ago he organized
a company known as theTinsley, Mill
er Co., and opened a wholesale house
in Louisville. The venture proved to
be successful, the house doing, a fine
business from the start. Mr. Miller
travels over the State himself, and his
reputation as a salesman is known
throughout tbe Commonwealth. He
handles the best of candies, his cus
tomers being ready for him each visit
he makes.
George, as he is called here, was
born and reared in Columbia. His
father, J. H. Miller, was a merchant
in this place, and was a man that the
entire county had the most implicit
confidence. He died and also his oldest
son, Nat, who assisted him in busi
ness, leaving the store to the care of
his younger sons George, Bob and
Henry, mere kids. They had busi
ness tact, and their father's affairs
were conducted uninterruptedly by
them for several years. All three of
the boys have been successful, ' Henry
in Columbia, Bob in Minnesota and
George on the road. The iatter makes
Columbia every three weeks and is
invariably given a cordial welcome by
the merchants and his friends gener
ally Here is hoping that a majority
of his good days are yet to come, and
all during life he may be successful in
his chosen occupation. He is married
and happy in a comfortable home in
Louisville..

in the Adair County Circuit Clerk's
office, the papers being served on one
of the committee, in this county.
Quite a number of relatives and

bellsville, last Friday. In the number
were the father, brothers and sister
of the deceased.
i The' meeting at the Christian church

the reputation of being a strong and
entertaining minister.

Words of Sympathy.
The sympathy of this publication
and many Columbia friends is extend
ed to Mr. John Q. Alexander, of Camp
bellsville, who lost his beloved wife
last Tuesday afternoon. The end
came suddenl in an infirmary in
Louisville where the husband had
conveyed his wife for an operation.
While lying upon a bed, resting, until
the specialist could make ready for the
operation, Mr. Alexander and his sons
being present, suddenly Mrs. Alexan
der's heart ceased to beat, notifying
the loved ones at the bedside that
the deatii angel had come. The scene
was heart rending, and when the in
telligence of the demise of the de
voted wife and loving molher was
flashed over the wires all heads bowed
in the profoundest sorrow. John Q.
Alexander and Mary McGee plighted
their love in Burkesville, where they
were married many years' ago Three
sons, two of them now grown, the
other about 16 years of age, came to
bless their union. A happy family,
the sons being useful and dutiful,
brought comfort and joy to the par
ents They never knew sorrow nor to
long for something they could not be
provided with, hence the sons have
lost the dearest friend upon earth
mother. The husband, though sur
rounded by his noble sons, who will do
all in their power to bring comfort,
nothing will soothe as did the lov
ing and sympathetic words of the
companion of his bosom The hus
band is a faithful Christian, aud he
will go to a sympathizing Savior, for
he alone can dry the tears of the
broken hearted.

The City Cemetery:
Some three or four years ago a com
mittee of ladies of this town was
placed in charge of the cemetery with
a"n allowance from the- town treasury
to meet the expenses of keeping it in
proper condition. The ladies did their
work well, and our "City of the Dead"
was cared for as it shoul be. For some
reason the City Council relieved them
and took charge, and the result has
been, as was predicted, almost abso
lute neglect. Now, the ladies are vol
untarily undertaking the work again,
but they are doing this without any
available funds, and they will have to
appeal to the liberal sentiment of the
public. A committee of ladies has
.been appointed to solicit funds for
this purpose, ana every one should
contribute something. This work
ought to be turned back to the ladies;
and a fixed amount of the town reve
nue should be set apart to be used by
them in their discretion. - x..x

Monday's Speaking.
The speaking in the court-house last
Monday drew a large and attentive
audience. Judge II. C. Baker was
chairman of the meeting aud asked
all present to hear the two distinguish
ed gentlemen present the issues in the
present campaign. Judge W. W.
Jones made an introductory speech
presenting Mr. Morrow and Mr. Gor
don Mdntgomery presented Congress
man Helm in a pointed and well
chosen speech. Mr. Morrow used an
hour and a half to the satisfaction of
his party, dwelling largely in indirect
criticism of the present administra
tion and also made a painstaking ef
fort to arouse fear in the election of
President Wilson. He is an orator
and ?. trained and skillful politician.
Mr. Helm "occupied an hour 'and in a "
pointed and forceful manner referred
to the achievements of the present ad
ministration showing achievements as
against promises. His speech was
well pleasing to a high degree and had
the ring of honest conviction.
