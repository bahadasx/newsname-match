URGES REFERENDUM ON
QUESTION OF SUFFRAG

New. Haven, Sept. 20 After a session lasting until early this
rfiorning, the sub-committee on resolutions completed a'drai't of
the platform to be submitted to the Democratic11 State conven

the entire, committee. ' The platform, adopted later by the con
vention, follows
The Democratic party in Connecti

affirms Its allegiance to the principles
of Democracy as expressed In the na
tional platform, anc pledges itself to
seek with patriotic zeal the re-election
of Woodrow Vjrilson and Thomas R.
Marshall, and of a Congress devoted
to Democratic policies that the nation
may be saved from war and that the
present period of unprecedented and
weH-,distrtbuted prosperity may be
continued. i
"In. 1910-12, a Democratic governor
was elected and the Democratic ad
ministration passed much remedial
legislation, including the workmen's
compensation act, a law establishing
civil service and a. law strengthening
the statue against corrupt practices.
"The workmen's compensation act
has been Judicially "construed as notl
clearly declaring the intention 01 tne
legislature to Include occupational dis
eased. We! favor an amendment to
heal this defect, to shorten the period
preceding compensation and otherwise
to make the statute conform to the
best modern practice.
"The last Republican legislature de
stroyed by evil amendment the civil
-service law of the state and re-insti
tuted the spoils system. We pledge
ourselves to restore Jthe law to Its for
mer vigor.
' "During the campaign of 112 cer
tain candidates expended great sums
of money "upon the theory that the
provisions of the corrupt practices act
had been successfully evaded. We
favor such amendments as wiU make
a like evasion hereafter impossible,.
"The Democratic administration of
1910 and 1912 made large appro
priations for the construction, of new
highways. The Republican, adminis

the policy of making such appropria-j

P. ,J. DanaSvy, of Willimantlc, pro

restless- and Chairman Reilly had to
use his gavel. . When Danahy - sat
down the chairman-said:
"Ton have heard the seconding
speech by the delegate from WilH

When M. D. O'Connor of Enfield
moved to nominate jby a rising vote.
Chairman Rellly said :

Beardsley made a short acceptance

peciallly such as may connect the

gressive voters of the state to the
achievements of the Democratic Con
gress in the interests of humanity and
urge their support of a party which
pledge's itself 'to. carry out the same
principles in state legislation."
Palmer, of 1 Oxford, proposed an
amendment , to strike out ajl specific
reference to equal suffrage.
D. W. Wilson, of Bridgeport, in ex
plaining the inclusion of the plank in
the draft, said that it was recognized
that it would be folly not to express
willingness to submit the question to
a referendum when the question looms
so large. .
Mr., Palmer, in reply, said the only
way to enfranchise women in this
state wojilfl be to amend the constitu
tion;' and that adoption of such a
plank would take away the right of
members of rthe legislature to say
that the constitution should be amend
ed. After a general discussion after
which the committee declined to
strike out the specific reference by a
vote of 16 to 9. The draft was then
approved. . ' '

CANDEE QUARREL
Gets Control of Property and
Mrs. White is Ordered' to
Leave Home.
LAWYERS CAREFULLY
CONSIDERING STEPS
Mrs. White Declares She
Has Been Refused Audi
ence With Mother.
Latest developments in the Fred
erick H. Stevens-Harriet C. White
controversy over possesion of the
person and property of Mrs. Sarah B.
Candee, widow of the founder of the
Bridgeport -Dally Standard, seemingly
give Mr. Stevens the ascendency. .
- It is reported at the former resi
dence of Mrs. Candee, 1249 Fairfield
avenue, today that Mrs. Harriet C.
White, widow of Daniel White, for
mer , superintendent of the Chicago
public schools, has been ousted from
the home here and will seek residence
elsewhere during the next few days.
"Mr. 'Stevens has secured tempor
ary power . from my mother to pos
session of anything he wants here, and
I shall 'have to move,", asserted Mrs.
White today. She further said:
"Mr. Stevens came here last week
armed with credentials from my moth
er. We were packing our things. Mr.
Stevens came . into the , house and
took a quantity of silverware and oth
er article- including even, the silver
ware with, which the table was set for
our meal. Attorney Carl Foster, my
attorney, has instructed me to make
no opposition at this time to 'any act
of Mr. Stevens." '
James H. Hart on, who has been
in this city for the past week inves
tigating the various angles of the con
troversy and who ostensibly repre
sents Chicago interests allied to the
estate of Daniel White. said:
"A great injustice has been done to
Mrs. White. For the past seven
years she voluntarily has added to
the support of Mrs. Candee whose es
tate is not sufficient for her maint
tainence. Statements have been
made which need retraction and acts
have been committed which, we toelieve
will not be sanctioned in the courts.
I am In hopes that the difficulties
which ,have. arisen without an appll
mutually adjusted without; an appll'
cation for' a conservator lover Mrs.
Candee, whlc yet may ' toe neces
sary. s '
"I may say that friends of Mrs.
White win spend as much as 310,000
for her vindication in this matter if
necessary. I contend that Mrs. Can
dee fs withheld in New Haven by un
due forct. Mrs. White has attempt
ed to see lier at 120 Cottage street,
New Haven, but has been denied even
entrance to the abode in which' she
i3 staying."
From a relation pf the family his
tory made 'by Mrs. White to a reporter
for the Farmer it would appear mat
dissension has warped the family
since early childhood of Mrs. White
and her sister, now Mrs. Stevens. The
culminating episode is said to have
been recent interchanges of stock
in the Bridgeport Standard; which it

in the criminal superior court this af
ternoon. He pleaded guilty to .the

In explaining the case to the court
Assistant State's Attorney Carter said
there was some circumstances which
Judge Tuttle ought to know. Pre
vious to. Aug. 14, the day of the
crime, Zimmerman had been employ

ed about the quality of the food and
as a result of this had a dispute with
Morris.
Zimmerman alleged Morris struck
him arM injured him so severely that
he could not leave his room for sev
eral days. After that Zimmerman
nourished a grudge against Morris
and nolsonlnar the poultry was his
manner of getting his revenge. At
torney Carter said he would consent
to a fine because he thought there
might have been slight provocation
for Zimmerman's act.
