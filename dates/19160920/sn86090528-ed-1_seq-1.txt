I I J 1U V1IU
Disregarding the suggestions which
have been made to him by good judg
es, R. B. Human declined to send his
famous stallion roadster, Prince
Patchen, to Oklahoma City to compete
at the state fair. This noble animal,
sired by the full blood brother to Joe
Patchen, the sire of Dan Patchen, cre
ated a sensation in the ring when
awarded the blue ribbon as being the
best in the roadster grade class and
stirred the spectators to applause.
This was repeated when his owner,
on pinning the first prize to the vic
tor, dropped the reins and crawled un
der Prince Patchen as he would under
a pet. The winner's ring manners
were remarked by tho crowd. This
was tho first time Prince Patchen was
ever exhibited.
Mr. Human won other honors with
his fine stock. Cever, in the roadster
class, won third prize even at h! .-;
weight, 1410, which was a splendid
showing. Dave Pannel, a colt from
Prince Patchen, won first prize in the
colt roadster grade class. He is a
beautiful colt and is marked like his
grand sire, George Wilke.
.T. R. Brown also carried off honors
in the same department and J. I..'
Smith won several premiums with his

State Superintendent Gives Ideas on

R. II. Wilson, state superintendent
of education, visited Chickasha yes

While in Chickasha Superintendent
Wilson reiterated his criticism of
overdress in public schools which was
made in Oklahoma City. In ihe opin

system, satins, silks and high heel
shoes, which nowadays are so popular
with some high school and grade
school students, are not only hinder

The school is distinctly an institution

Mr. Wilson was talking in reply to
a request for an expression from him
on needed reforms in the school sys
tem. "There are many reasons why chil
dren should not dress extravagantly
while attending school," he continued.
"P; is not in good taste. It is not in
