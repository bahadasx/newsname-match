GRANGE FAIR CALLED OFF.
Plans for the Grange fair to have
been held on the Barton fair grounds
Fhursday, Sept. 28, have been called
ff since that part of the order of the
state board of health forbidding chil
dren under 16 years of age to attend
fairs, , was called to the attention of
the managers. Since the fair was to
have been largely for the children and
the prizes were to go to the children
this order seems to have quashed all
possibility of having the event and
making it a success.
The Grangers cannot understand why
children may crowd moving picture
theatres and ' congregate in school
rooms but cannot gather in the open at
a little Grange fair.

Schools Open.
Barton academy opened Monday with
a registration of an even hundred
which is expected to increase. This
is slightly larger than last year and
nearly reaches the seating capacity of
the assembly room. The grades also
show a large registration, the entire
building containing approximately 300
students. The first grade has 29 be
ginners. The teaching corps was com
plete as announced. The Monitor hopes
to publish comprehensive school news
from time to time.
Express Thanks.
The Monitor is in receipt of letters
from individuals, and from those rep
resenting more than one, expressing
their appreciation to the people of Bar
ton for their effort to give them a half
day of entertainment Friday. The
Monitor doubts very much whether the
people of the surrounding towns are
more disappointed than those of Barton
in the outcome resulting from a down
pour that day and their inability to
have the event later this fall, but
plans are under foot for a similar day
another season. In closing, one of the
letters to the Monitor said, "It was a
deed of kindliness on your part and I
am sure I voice the sentiment of the
people of Glover and surrounding
towns when I say we appreciate your
kindness. It will be the means of
binding the people closer together in
love and friendship and will long be
remembered by us. Thank you again
in behalf of the people."

Mrs. Mary Gilman.
Mary Gilman was born in Inverness,
Canada, Jan. 24, 1845, and died July
31, 1916. The circumstances attending
her death were exceedingly sad, as she
had gone to the home of one of her
sons, George Gilman, to assist them in
caring for some of their children, who
were sick with a contagious disease.
She considered herself immune as she
had bad the disease in childhood, but
being in a delicate condition, she was
a fit subject to contract the disease,
which terminated very quickly in her
death. The burial took place very
quickly and no funeral services could
be held until Sunday afternoon,
August 27th, after the quarantine was
lifted from the homes affected. The1
funeral service was held at the Lyndon
Center Baptist church by the writer, a
long-time friend of the family, assist
ed by the Rev. Mr. Gould, pastor of
the church. A large company of rela
tives were present, and many and
beautiful were the floral tributes. 1
Besides her children there were pre
sent at the service, her brothers and
sister, John Hinton of Westmore,
George Hinton of Barton, Mrs. H.
Roberts of East Charleston. Of other
relatives present there were Mrs.
Charles Marshall, Mr. and Mrs. Roy
Bugbee of West Burke, and J. Carroll
of Woodbury. Mrs. Gilman has been a
hard-working woman all her life, and
with her warm sympathies and gener
ous nature and earnest Christian spirit,
she never hesitated to give herself to
the services of those who needed her
help. She was married to Joseph
Gilman July 18, 1867, at Westmore,
who had five small children and as a
fruit of the marriage, nine children
were born, seven of whom are livinar:
Elmer E., of New York, Peter and
George of Sutton, Edson of Lyndon,
Mrs. Frank Ryder of Barton, Mrs.
Amos Berry and Mrs. Harry Bickford
of Sheffield. Those living of the -first
family are Charles of Cabot, Mrs.
Andrew Ordway of Turnbridge, Alva
of Sheffield and James of Hardwick.
Mrs. Gilman's husband died about nine
years ago after a long and trying
illness. Together they brought up a
large family who now rise up to honor
their memory. "Blessed be the dead
who die in the Lord, for they shall rest
from their labors and their works do
follow them."
Charles W. Kelley,
Irasburg.
Henry Harding got a bad spill at
White River Junction last week in one
of the races at the state fair. Hard
ing was driving Kleet when the horse
became frightened at some auto tracks
across the race course and jumped.
Several other horses being ,back
of Harding were unable to avoid a col-
ision and in the mix-up Harding was
badly bruised about the head and
shoulders. Pickel was thrown in the
mix-up but sustained only minor inju
ries. From the Windsor Journal 'the Moni
tor copies the following : The parish
ioners of the local Methodist church
will be grieved to learn that their
pastor, Rev. W. C. Johnson, has decid
ed to abandon his pastorate and move
to the town of Derby, where he hopes
to regain his health by a complete
rest from the responsibility which has
been his in the Vermont conference
for many years. Rev. Mr. Johnson
has been in Windsor for the past three
and one-half years and during that
time has made many friends by his
kindly and cheerful manner. For some
time he has been at Willoughby lake
in the northern part of the state, be
lieving that a change would help him.
He has been benefited, but on the ad
vice of his physician will not attempt
to do the work of a settled pastor until
he has" rested for a year. We shall all
miss Pastor Johnson, for a real shep
herd he is in every sense of the word,
a good man who lives what he
preaches.
A remarkable life, some years of
which were spent in this village and vi
cinity, and was closely entwined with
the educational and religious interests.
ended with the death of Mrs. William
Kelley at her home inColton, N. Y., on
July 21, 1916. Fanny J. Dorion was
born in Glover Oct. 9, 1837. Her fa
ther was afflicted with an ancient dis
ease, with the modern name of Wan
derlust, and after a nomadic life of
many years, in which his family resided
for brief periods in 22 different towns,
the family settled in this village,
where they resided some years. It is
noted by a member of the family that
Fanny began her school career at
three years of age and at seven was a
pupil at the now famous academy at
Brownington, when Dr. Twilight was
in charge. She was a member of the
Congregational church here and very
successful as a teacher, was faithful
and conscientious in the discharge of
her various duties in church and school
and much respected during her resi
dence here. She married Simeon Pat
terson of West Glover, who died of
fever in less than a year. On June 6,
1876, she married William Kelley, a
native of Montpelier, who died some
years ago. She is survived by an
adopted daughter, two sisters, Mrs.
Martha Bickford of Illinois and Mrs.
Mary Sherburne, widow of Charles
Sherburne of Glover, who at present
resides with us. Her only brother,
Charles S. Dorion, became an artist of
some renown and was known in New
York and other cities as a painter of
marine views of note. He died in New
York City some years ago but is well
remembered byjaany residents of this
village.

GUEST DAY.
r
The words of the immortal poet
Burns, "The best laid schemes of mice
and men gang aft a-gley," were
brought pointedly home, to the Im
provement Club committees and to all
Barton's citizens Friday when after
weeks of sunshiny weather old Mr.
Rainman started early with the sprin
kler and kept it up at intervals all
day. Barton was really about to put
over a first-class stunt and show our
neighbors that we could extend a glad
hand, and welcome them within our
borders, but the celebration was nec
essarily to be an out-of-doors affair
and all plans went by the board Sev
eral parties in automobiles did venture
in and we hope were somewhat enter
tained by the photoplay at the Gem
theatre. Those who were fortunate
enough to see this picture can feel as
sured that they have seen one of the
finest screen portrayals ever produced,
and a picture that ranks with such
productions as "Carmen" and "Ju
dith." The club rooms were kept
open and a number of visitors were
shown through the rooms and enter
tained by club members. Early in the
afternoon it became apparent that the
concert and corn roast at Roaring
Brook Park would have to be abandon
ed and it was truly a shame because
Barton has a perfect right to be espe
cially proud of the band this season as
it has been on other years, but this
year the boys are paying difficult stuff
and getting the right technique.
At a meeting of the Barton Improve
ment club on Saturday it was decided
in view of ti e fact that the band would
be disorganized and many of the base
ball fellows away at school, to make
no further fttenpt to hold the Guest
Day cplebiatKa this year but it is
hoped to hve bigger and better one

APHORISMS OF BEECHER.
The real man is one who al
ways finds excuses for others,
but never for himself.
Success is full of promise till
men get it, and then it is last
year's nest from ; which the
birds have flown.
In the morning we carry ; the
world like Atlas; at noon we
stoop and bend beneath It, and
at night it crushes us flat to the
ground. .f-
A cunning man overreaches
no one half as much as himself.
The philosophy of one century
is the common sense of the next.
Not that which men do worth
ily, but that they do success
fully, is - what history makes
haste to record.
Selfishness is that detestable
vice which no one will forgive
in others, and no one is without
it himself.
There is somebody to believe
in anybody who is uppermost.
From Sermons of Henry Ward
Beecher.
