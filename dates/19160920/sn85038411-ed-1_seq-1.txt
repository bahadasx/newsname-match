CITY EAGER FOR
# RISE OF CURTAIN j
ON FASHION SHOW
Thousands Await Chance To
night to "Oh" and "Ah" on
Brilliant Streets
PRIZES FOR WINDOWS
Judges Will Be Busy; Fantastic
Parade and Great Dance
in Square Friday
"To-night's 'tne night'!"
Word and deed to-day were surely
obedient children to that big thought
that was expressed in every business
house and store in the city's commer
cial section, central. Hill and West
End.
Proprietors and floorwalkers glanced
more frequently at watches; the girls
behind tho counters were an evening
or two ahead in their thought; clerks !
were secretly thankful that the weeks j
of preparation were all over to-day; j
window decorators added the last,
touches behind the curtained display j
windows of scores of stores and went j
home happy and hoping.
It is "The Night"
For to-night the big three-night cele- 1
bration of Harrisburg's first uniform |
merchants' Fall opening begins—and |
the curtain will rise at 7.30 o'clock on
the "window dressing contest." j
To-morrow night there will be infor- :
mal "doings," the crowds will just
stroll about the streets and look at
the windows. The board of judges
—window dressing experts from out of
town —will be the busiest of busy men. \
They'll be judging windows to-night!
and to-morrow night. Just a word to
you. Mr. Merchant, if you haven't ob- i
tained a display card from the Cham
ber of Commerce. These cards, which
announce the fact that the store in
which the card is displayed is an en
trant in the "dressing" competition,
must be in the window, the judges
will not consider a window which is j
not so marked.
On Other Evenings
Briefly speaking, the program for
the three evenings is this;
At 7.25 o'clock to-night the city s
"white wav" will be darkened, when
the street lights will be turned off and
tho electric signs and window lights
will be turned down behind the deeply
curtained windows. A few minutes
later the clamor of the fire bells will
give a city-wide notice of the fact that
Harrisburg's merchants are about to
show what they can display In the way !
of the very latest In Fall coats and |
suits and stockings and hats and shoes ,
and other things.
At 7.30 o'clock the lights will flash ;
on again and the scores of curtains
will rise on the big Fall fashion show.
And the Crowds—Wlievv!
Bv that time it is safe to say that
Market Square, Market street and the
other streets upon which the gaily
lighted stores front will hardly be able
to hold the crowds. In Market Square
In the meantime there will be a hand
concert. This has been arranged by
David Kaufman in front of the Kauf
man Underselling Stores.
To-morrow night, 'tis true, will be
more or less "show night." But then
on Friday evening—oh! my, that s
to be tho finale. ,
That whole southwest section of
Market Square Is to be turned into a
gigantic open-air dance floor where
hundreds of gaily costumed dancers
will frolic for hours In mad pre-Hal
lowe'en capers to tlie music or the
Municipal band.
On With the Dance
From 9 o'clock until midnight the
dance will go on. A grand march will
be the first number. To enter the
march one must be costumed and
masked The unmasking will follow
the grand march, after which every
body can slip Into the great roped-oft
enclosure and dance. Handsome sil
ver cups will be awarded to the wear
ers of the most original and the most
comicil feminine and masculine cos
tumes. V. Grant Forrer. assistant
park superintendent, is to be the chair
man of the board of judges.
Oostumcrb will be here from isew
York on Friday to distribute costumes
Pt a reasonable figure. They will make
the Commonwealth their headquarters.
Tlie Marshals
Plenty of policemen, It Is true, will
keep the crowds outside the ropes and
in addition to the officers there will be
the following gaily costumed mar-

Rotary Committee Named;
Will Meet This Evening
Howard C. Fry, president of the
Harrisburg Rotary Club, this after
noon named the following commit
tee of the Rotary Club, in accord
with a resolution passed last night,
to co-operate with the Chamber of
Commerce committee in raising
funds for the new hotel for Har
risburg: John S. Musser, chair
man; Ralph W. Dowdell, Wm. S.
Essick, A. E. Buchanan, Carl M.
Kaltwasser, W. Grant Raucli, Sam

ney, Edward Frazer and Gus M.
Steinmetz. The committee will
meet this evening at 7:30 at Mr.
Musser's place of business, the
Dauphin Electrical Supplies Com
pany, 434 Market street.
The Harrisburg Rotary Club, meet
ing at the exhibition rooms of the
Cumberland Valley Telephone Com
pany, last evening gave its hearty en
dorsement to the new hotel plan, au
thorized the appointment of a com
mittee to assist in the sale of stock
and pledged its moral and financial
support to the great undertaking.
In addition the club witnessed a
working demonstration of the new
automatic telephone to be installed in
Harrisburg and passed resolutions en
dorsing it from the standpoint of the
telephone user.
On recommendation of President
Howard C. Fry the Rotarians guaran
teed the expense of a campaign in
Harrisburg to be undertaken next
April by the Boy Scouts of America
whereby money will be raised to
finance a Boy Scout campaign in this
city on a well organized working
basis for the coming three years. Plans
for this will be announced later. The
resolution was introduced by William
B. Bennett.
Hotel Plan Endorsed
The endorsement of the hotel pro- ■
position came after a series of ad- :
dresses on the subject by J. William
Bowman, president of the Chamber of j
Commence, E. Z. Wallower, E. J. j
Stackpole and Ed. S. Herman.
The club took heartily to the idea. |
For a number of years it has been
urging the formation of a hotel com
pany and the fact that the movement
lias been undertaken by Harrisburg :
people and is backed by local capital j
was very pleasing to the Rotarians.
All of the speakers were optimistic as

Longer and Less Flaring
Skirts to Be Worn This Fall
New York, Sept. 20. Long and!
less flaring skirts are indicated by the j
Fall fashions, says the semiannual re
port of the Silk Association of Amer
ica. They will be of ankle length, fre
quently made of pleats, and requiring
as much or more material than last
season, is the prediction. Paris fash
ions, it is asserted, have not favored
the extremely short, almost freaky
skirts which have been worn here this
year.
The wearing of these skirts unques
tionably has increased the demand for
silk hosiery, both fancy and plain,
says the reports of the experts.
American People Rank
Last in Thriftiness
St. Louis, Sept. 20. The Ameri
can people rank last in thriftiness ac
cording to J. Lioneberger Davis, vice
president of the St. Louis Union Trust
Company, who addressed the conven
tion of the National Association of
Life Underwriters here to-day.
"It is significant," he said, "that In
the United States where wages are no
toriously high, 99 people out of each
1,000 have saving accounts, whereas
in Australia there are 300, in Eng
land 302; in Germany 317; in France
346: in Belgium 397 and in Switzer
land 554. John G. Jones, of the Alex
ander Hamilton Institute, said that the
time is nearly passed when life in
surance men are to be looked upon
as nuisances.
Son Here Gets $25 of Half
Million Dollar Estate
Howard I. Colton, 182 5 Whitehall
street, son of he late George W. Col
ton, Brooklyn, N. Y., was cut off with
only $25 worth of furniture in his
father's will, according to a dispatch
from that city, while the remainder of
the estate, amounting to $499,010.05,
was given to his daughter, Harriette
E., 1350 Pacific street, Brooklyn.
Mr. Colton, who was 87 years old,
was a noted civil engineer and a large
amount of his estate is in securities.
Expenses total $7,729.40. making the
total inheritance for the daughter, who
was named as executrix, $491,280.65.
WIFE SAVES HUSBAND'S
LIFE AFTER QUARREL
York, Pa., Sept. 20. Norman C.
Beard, 40 years old, after a quarrel
with his wife at home last night went
to the cellar, hanged himself with a
window cord to the joists. His wife
out him down.
The police found life still remained
and .revived Beard. Then he fought
| like a tiger and was rushed to the lios
| pital and put in a strait-Jacket. He
1 will recover.

Incomplete Primary Returns

New York, Sept. 20. lncomplete
returns from yesterday's primary elec
tion in New York State fail to decide
the fight for the Republican nomina
tion for the United States Senate be
tween Robert Bacon, former ambassa
dor to France, and William M. Calder,
of Brooklyn, a former member of
Congress. The vote in 4,303 districts
out of a total of 5,719, gave Calder
to-day a majority of 4.6C1, but
Bacon's campaign managers hoped
that later returns from outside New
York City would wipe out this lead.
They based their expectations on
the fact that Bacon made his best run
up-State, where 2,999 districts thus
for reporting out of a total of 3,640
gave him a majority of 24,645. This
was more than offset by the heavy vote
his opponent received in New York
City.

PIKE TO READING
ORDERED REBUILT
Great Victory For Motor Club;
Order Seventeen Miles
Macademized
The hearing this morning before
Commissioner Michael J. Ryan, of the
Public Service Commission, on the
complaint of the combined motor
clubs of Harrisburg, Palmyra and
Reading against the Dauphin and
Berks County Turnpike Company for
not keeping their pike in repair, re
sulted in the order being made pub
lic requiring the turnpike company to
resurface and rebuild with macadam
the entire length of highway extend
ing for a distance of seventeen miles
from the Dauphin county line to a
point at the eastern end of Werners
ville.
It is stipulated that the work must
be finished by July 1, 1917. Forty
witnesses were called before the com
mission by the attorneys representing
the three motor clubs, who were
Frank B. Wicker§t\jii, John Fox
Weiss. Gabriel H. Moyer, of this city,
and William M. Wolfe, of Reading.
The witnesses were mainly motorists
from Lebanon, Annville, Palmyra and
Harrisburg.
The turnpike company is likewise
instructed in the order to rebuild a
number of bridges that are in need
of repair, put up guard rails where
necessary, take a dangerous curve out
of the road at Lebanon and effect
such other changes as are designated.
The decision of the Public Service
Commission is regarded in the light
of a victory for the Motor Club of
Harrisburg, which was instrumental
in bringing about the action against
the turnpike company.
SMALL CHANCE OF !
AVERTING STRIKE
Labor Leaders Say 700,000
Workers Will Go Out With
the Trolley Men
New York, Sept. 20. Despite the j
attempted intervention of a committee
of businessmen, there seemed to be i
little prospect to-day of averting a j
general strike in sympathy with the '
street railway employes. Labor leaders
aver that the proposed general walk
out will involve about 700,000 work
ers in all trades.
A second conference of the business
men with the Mayor and chairman of
the Public Service Commission was I
called to-day but It was the feeling of
those most directly concerned that the
situation had reached an absolute
deadlock.
Union leaders have promised to
withhold their order for a sympathetic
strike until after Thursday.
Throughout the night elevated
trains, together with subway trains at

Number of Lives Lost in
Rioting After German Losses
in Somme Are Made Known
London, Sept. 20.—Serious rioting,
in which a number of lives were lost,
took place at Chemnitz Saturday after,
noon, according to a Central News dis
patch from The Hague.
The dispatch says the rioting started
when the news arrived of the heavy
losses of Chemnitz workmen in the
Somme battle. Crowds assembled on
the streets and sang "The Internation
ale." They refused to disperse and
wore charged by Hussars. Five Hus
sars were killed and 300 armed with
revolvers were arrested.
Sweden, Often Scourged
by Infantile Paralysis
Has Not Found Cure
Stockholm, Sweden, Sept. 20.—What
can be done to cure and prevent in

The Associated Press correspondent
has put this question to all of Sweden's
leading authorities on poliomyelitis, as
the disease is scientifically known, and
their answer has been the same. "Wo
don't know."
Tills answer is the more discourag
ing in view of the fact that Sweden,
almost alone among European coun
tries, has been repeatedly scourged by
the epidemic, and, as a result, has a
number of physicians and bacteri
ologists who have devoted themselves
for years almost exclusively to the
study of the disease. Nowhere else ex
cept in the Rockefeller Institute of
New York have such exhaustive in
vestigations een made, and the sum
of them all Is the answer given above:
/'We don't know."
MONSTER BATTLE
IS RAGING ALONG j
EASTERN FRONT
Teutons Concentrating Against
Menacing Drives of Russians
and Rumanians
ROTH CLAIM ADVANTAGE
Entente Winning in Macedo-;
nia; Greece Reported to
Have Sent Ultimatum
Fighting on a huge scale Is in prog
ress along the eastern war front,
whence the center of interest has shift
ed following the let-up in the heavy i
allied atacks along the Somme in the
west.
Evidence is accumulating that the
central powers are now devoting their
main attention to the conditions In
the east, concentrating large forces
against Rumania, notably under Field
Marshal Von Mackensen in Dobrudja,
and putting all possible available men
in the field to stop the Russian march
on Lemberg byway of Halicz and the
menacing drives of the Russians and
I Rumanians in the Carpathians and
I Transylvania.
Both Sides Claim Advantage
Both Berlin and Sofia report the de
velopment of a great battle on the line
.the Russians and Rumanians have
i taken up in Dobrudja to defend the
| railroad route into interior Rumania
| from Constanza, on the Black Sea. The
engagement, they declare, is turning
lin favor of the force of the central
j powers under Von Mackensen. Latest
j reports from the fighting in Galicia
| and Volhynia show the Teutonic forces
I on the offensive and claiming decided
advantages over the Russian armies
under General Brussiloff.

AT MOUNT UNION
Cotton Dry House at Plant of
Aetna Explosives Company
Completely Destroyed
MANY EMPLOYES INJURED
Bodies of Killed Torn to
Shreds; Wounded Taken to
Huntingdon Hospital
Mount Union, Pa., Sept. 20. Six
men were killed and a number injured
at 6 o'clock this morning when a ter
rific explosion completely destroyed
the cotton dry house at the plant of
the Aetna Explosives Company here.
The men were changing shifts at the
j time, the night workers Just going
j away from the building at the Ume.
' On account of this many of them es
| raped injury.
j Tho dry house stood away from the
I other buildings about 400 yards and
i was located along the river bank.
The bodies of the men killed were
blown into bits, which were scattered
over the ground in the vicinity of the
demolished building. Many of the in
jured workmen were badly hurt and
were immediately taken to the Hunt
ingdon Hospital. The bodies of the
dead arc at the plant.
The workmen killed were: George
Stair, Orbisonia; Elmer Pyle, Orbi
sonia; Clayton Clark, Marietta; Elmer
Bair, Orbisonia; William Lehman,
Portage, and Charles Ulsch, Orbisonia.
Twenty-one men were employed in the
building.. Of those hurt it is thought
that only three have received serious
injuries.
The explosion occurred in C dry
house and that building was blown to
atoms, parts of it being found more
than half a mile away. Dry house A,
standing a short distance away, was
somewhat damaged and at one time
was on fire. It is stated that 100,000
pounds of powder exploded.
There have been rumors for several
days that the contracts held by the
company had been filled and that the
