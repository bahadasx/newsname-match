doffed everybody stands aghast.
"The kaiser is coming The All
Highest is already on the spot! He
takes off his coat! In his shirt sleeves
the head of the German empire works
in the field! He lends a hand to se
cure for himself God's golden bless
ing. As the kaiser does, so do the
high officials and officers. And look!
Do you not see our imperial chan
cellor working? It is true! It is he.
"With surprise the spectators be
hold the kaiser wiping the sweat from
his brow with his sleeve. We see

asks them to run across the stubble
field, and, laughing heartily at the
enjoyment of the children, gives them
little presents."

POPE'S LETTER
IS PUBLISHED
Venice, .Sept. 20.—Monsignor La

published a letter from Pope Bene
dict, deploring the attempts against
the churches and treasures of Venice
and rejoicing that the church of San
Giovanni Paolo escaped "blind blows
only sustaining damage which for
tunately can be repialred."
The pope calls the explosion before
St. Mark, the destruction of the
church of Santa Marie Formosa, and
the damage to the church of Gli Scal
zi "bitter wounds to my heart," and
regreta that his efforts to prevent such
misfortunes have failed. He con

Paris, Sept. 20.—A delicate ques
tion was raised In the chamber of
deputies yesterday by M. Roux
Costada. who asked Premier Briand
to see to it that there was not only
unity of action on all fronts by the
allies, but also proportionate effec
tives.
Protests were made from various
parts of the chamber against any dis
cussion of the subject of the propor
tionate number of troops engaged
from the different entente countries.
M. Roux-Costada nevertheless per
sisted, saying that France could not
expect to give 'the blood of all her
children, and that the allies should
make the necessary sacrifices.'
Premier Briand in reply, objected
to the question, and declared that It
was unjust to throw doubt on the
efforts of the allies In such a sacred
cause. England, he said had hever
said "No" to any demand for aid.
Italy had made the utmost efforts she
possibly could, considering the diffi
culties of the mountainous theatre of
war in which she was operating.
Russia had sent to France her sol
diers from acrosB the world.
"Tomorrow," continued the pre
mier, "you will see this Joint action
expanding still more."
Replying to another speaker, M.
Brlson, representing the AlUer de
partment in the old province of Bour
bonnais. who attempted to calculate
the economic value of the mein who
had fallen In the war,' Premier Briand
said:

At this point the members of the
chamber rose, cheering M. Briand
and howling down M. Brlzon.
Resuming, the premier said:
You little know France. Monsieur
Brlson. if you think she can sell her
blood. What peace would you ask'
for this country at this moment? If
peace were made now it would be a
peace of war and a menace to future
generations.
"The treacherous blow Germany
tried to strike failed, but would be
tried afresh. For forty-four years
your country worked with a wound in
her aide. There already gleams on

Berlin, Sept. 20, (wireless Say

losses in the battle of the Somme
have reached 64,000 men, the
Overseas Agency estimates. De
spite what the British refer to as a
great victory, the result of the bat
tle of Somme should be gauged by
considering the amount of French
and Belgian territory occupied by
the Germans, which amounts in all
to 50,000 square kilometres. Of this
29,000 is Belgium and 21,000 in
France. The efforts of the F''enoh

appalling. It is conservatively es

Attempts to End Life in
County, Bastile—Borrows
Razor to Shave.
Charles Johnson, the man who was
apprehended by local officials last
Monday, and who was believed to be
insane, attempted suicide yesterday
afternoon, while confined in the coun
ty jail. Johnson slashed his throat
with a razor, but was prevented from
carrying out his gruesome deed by
other prisoners, who overpowered
him before he had severed his wind
pipe.
Johnson appeared to be recovering
from the effects of delirium tremens,
which was believed to have unbal
anced his mind, and when he asked
for permission to shave and remove
his mustache, one of the trusted pris
oners was given a razor, with which
to perform the work.
During the removal of the mus
tache, Johnson became dissatisfied
with the manner in which the ama
teur barber was performing the work,
and asked for the razor, in order that
he might proceed with the tonsorial
performance. Not suspecting the
purpose of Johnson, the instrument
was handed over by the trutsy and no
sooner had the change of possession
been made than Johnson slashed his
throat. His attempt was not success
ful. as prisoners interfered. He suc
ceeded, however, in cutting a gash
over four inches long.
The injury was given medical at
tention and Johnson is now reported
to be recovering rapidly.

Ottawa. Sept. 20 —At a meeting
held recently. Lady Borden presiding,
and attended by presidents of several
of the women's organizations in Ot

well presentation from Ottawa women
to the Duchess of Connaught, In token
of their appreciation of her active and
unfailing interest in all good causes
in this country. A committee was
appointed to carry on the matter.
Some time ago the duchess became

was on foot throughou Canada, and
she intimated at once that, in view
of the various calls on the public
necessitated by the war, she could not
accept any personal gift.
In view of this expressed wlBh, it
was thought that a contribution might
be made to the Duchess of Connaught

this suggestion, with the stipulation
that it is to be for Canadian prisoners

fronts in Transylvania and Dubruijja that the Italian troops on the Macs
is giving rise to some apprehension
here, although the news of the latest
events comes largely from enemy
sources, and therefore is taken with
certain reserve.
"It seems possible." says the Times
today, "that the Russo-Rumanian
forces in Dobrudja may soon be in
need of help. The actual position of
affairs in Transylvania is equally un
certain. Why did Rumania allow
herself to leave her Dobrudja front
Inadequately protected? The fact Is
that Rumania had no wish to quarrel
with Bulgaria. She did not declare
war on Bulgaria, and to this day Bul
garia has not officially declared war
on Rumania.
"But the situation was apparently
stamped by Field Marshal von Mec
kensen with the connivance of King
Ferdinand of Bulgaria and M. Rado
slavoff, the Bulgarian premier. The
Bulgarian chief of staff. General Jost
off, died mysteriously, and is now be
lieved to have been murdered. The
Bulgarian staff was then superseded,
and the Bulgarian army became mere
ly a wing of the German army, with
Its field marshal, von Mackensen, in
control.
"There are two manifest comments
on the situation. The first Is. if the

Is that the sooner General Sarrall,

Sept. 20.—There Is reason to be
lieve that the Greek government
