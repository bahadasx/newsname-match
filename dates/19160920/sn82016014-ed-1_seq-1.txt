Ernest Godfrey Had Been Held
for Investigation.
Krnest Godfrey. alleged check
artist, cou'd not fall into any of the
traps set for him by Robert Miler,
city detective, for the simple reason
timt up was in the city jail. Today.
Miler located him among the other
prisoners and a warrant was issued
ficnr. the court of Topeka charging
Godfrey with passing a worthless
check on the Paxton store. The com
plaint was sworn to by T. R. Paxton.
The Paxton check is just one of
many Miler has been carrying around
in his pocket. It is for S3. 50. Godfrey
bought a pair of shoes for J2.G0 and
obtained the difference in cash.
The first bum check of the present
collection was handed to Miler last
April or May. He began a search for
the maker. More checks with the
same signature showed up. Eventual
Iv Miler had a collection of five. Last
week Miler was stationed at the fair
grounds. He had a perfect descrip
tion of the man for whom he was
looking and he made arrangements
with concessionaires at the fair to em
ploy his man if they saw him. Some
of them knew him by sight but not
by name.
"I visited those stand men every
half hour to see if they had my man,"
said Miler today. "I thought- sure
some one of them would spot him and
hold him long enough for me to ar
rest him."
But Godfrey had the best reason !n
the world for not falling into Miler's
trap. He was held at the city jail
for investigation and no one there
connected him with the "snow" Miler
was carrying. , .
Today Harvey Parsons, chief of
police, told Miler that unless some
thins was found "on" Godfrey he
would hi ve to turn him loose.
"We have held him as long as we
can under the law." he said.
Let's giv-him the once over, said
Miler. -
Godfrey was brought out and Miler
took him into the court room. Miler
had dreamed over the description of
his check artist, and when he saw
Godfrey there was something familiar
about him. The detective took a long
shot.

CALF SHOW PASSE,
FASHION TABOOS
THE SHORT SKIRT
New York, Sept. 20. Longer and
less flaring skirts are indicated by the
fall fashions, says the semi-annual re
port of the Silk Association of Amer
ica. They will be of ankle length fre
quently made of pleats and requiring
as much or more material than last
season, is the prediction.
Paris fashions, it is asserted, have
not favored the extremely short, al
most freaky skirts which have been
worn here this year. The wearing ot
these skirts unquestionably has in
creased the demand for silk hosiery
both fancy and plain, say the reports
of the experts.
This Suit Will Be Filed in the
Federal Court.
PROPERTY TO STOCKHOLDERS
Refinancing Company to Meet
Outstanding Bills.
Suit Today Is Backed by Presi
dent of Company.
Formal action looking to dissolution
of the Kansas Natural Gas company
receivership and sale of the property,
has been taken by S. M. Brewster, at
torney general. Suit today in the
Montgomery county district court by
President Hays asks that the receiver
ship be dissolved. A report today In
state house circles indicated immedi
ate action by the attorney general for
the sale of the plant. This suit ia to
be filed in the federal court.
Brewster's suits seek the restora
tion of the gas company property to
the stockholders. The suit in Mont
gomery county followed a conference
in Kansas City Monday night when
plans for refinancing the company
and meeting outstanding indebtedness
were discussed by attorneys and repre
sentatives of the gas company.
Bucked by President.
There will probably be no serious
dispute concerning the reorganization
plans of the gas company. The suit
to dissolve the receivership is backed
by Victor A. Hays, president of the
Kansas Natural. Following news from
Independence today to the effect that
lays and his associates had become
parties to the dissolution suit, it was
reported that the attorney general
had also prepared a petition asking
for the sale of the gas company prop
erty. This suit is scheduled to be filed
In the federal court. vV hether the pe
tition will be held back in view of to
day's action in the Montgomery coun
ty court, has not been announced.
Officials of theBgas company pro
pose to raise four and a half million
dollars through the issuance of nine
million dollars worth of stock, it is
asserted. It Is reported that this stock
will be' placed on the market at 50
per cent par value. This money is
expected to meet outstanding indebt
edness. Mile of Pipe a Day.
One of the arguments advanced in
the suit to dissolve the receivership is
the statement that stockholders have
subscribed sufficient funds to re
finance the company and build new
pipe lines to supply sources in Kansas
and Oklahoma. Some of these pipe
lines are now in course of construc
tion, according to a statement in To
peka recently by John M. Landon, re
ceiver for the company. He asserted
in a Topeka statement that a mile of
mains is being laid every day in an
effort to tap new fields in Oklahoma
and Kansas.
Corporation papers of the Kansas
Natural were issued under the laws
of Delaware. It is asserted that the
laws of Delaware permit the issuance
of additional stocks under conditions
such as are now faced by the gas com
pany. The company will now seek to
block proceedings by the state to stop
the stock issue.
In a statement from Independence
today, it was asserted that thru the
reorganization plan the gas company
would soon be placed on a paying
basis provided a rate "commensurate
with the cost of production and dis
tribution is secured.

Denmark, Norway and Sweden Hold
Conference to Continue Neutral.
London, Sept. 20. King Haakon, of
Norway, speaking at a dinner given
to the Swedish and Danish minister
of state at Christiania, declared that
the Scandinavian nations were united
in their desire to remain neutral ac
cording to a dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph company. The dinner at
which the king spoke was given in con
nection with a series of conferences
which are being held at the Norwegian
capital by the Scandinavian ministers
of state.
King Haakon said the conferences
were only intended to protect Scan
dinavian interests. The meetings which
will continue thruout the wreek are the
outcome of the earlier meeting by the
king3 of Denmark, Norway and Swe
den, at Malmo, at which it was decid
ed that the three nations should co
operate to safeguard their rights as
neutrals.
NAME E. E. BROOKENS
Topeka n Will Organize Hughes Col
lege Clubs In Kansas
Chicago, Sept. 20. Edward E.
Brookens, of Topeka, Kan., has been
named as organizer of Hughes college
clubs in his state, it was announced
today at western Republican head
quarters. Mr. Brookens came to Topeka seven
years ago from Lawrence, where he
was graduated from the Kansas
university law school.
He has been a successful lawyer in
Topeka for many years, and has held
the position of first assistant supreme
court reporter at the state house.
Mr. Brookens lives at 1282 College
avenue.
He left Topeka today for Lawrence,
where he will begin his duties of or

Hughes.
Business 3Ien and Mayor Seek
Peace Pact in Vain.
RIOTING WORSE THAN EVER
Attempt to Run ight Cars Met
With Bombardments.
Fifteen Former Employes in
Jail Charged With Felony.
New York, Sept. 20. Despite the at
tempted intervention of a committee
of business men, there seemed to be
little prospect today of averting a gen
eral strike in sympathy with the street
railway employes. Labor leaders aver
that the proposed general walkout will
involve about 700,000 workers in all
trades.
A second conference of the business
men with the mayor and chairman of
the public service commission was
called today but it was the feeling of
those most directly concerned that the
situation had reached an absolute
deadlock. The attempt to operate
surface cars last night resulted in the
worst noting since the strike began
but the officials of the transit com
panies say the service in the day time
is improving steadily.
Thruout the night, elevated train3
together with subway trains at points
where they run on elevated structures
were subjected to almost ceaseless
bombardment of bottles and bricks,
car windows being shattered and a
number of passengers injured. Today
there were several attacks on surface
cars by strikers and sympathizers and
police reserves were repeatedly called
out.
Gompers on the Scene.
With the arrival here today of
Samuel Gompers, president American
Federation of Labor to attend the fu
neral of Seth Low, it was learned that
business interests which are endeav
oring to avert a sy m pathetic strike
had invited Mr. Gompers to attend
their meeting with labor leaders to
morrow. It was indicated by the un
ion men that Mr. Gompers planned to
take more than ordinary interest in
the situation. Mr. Gompers held his
acceptance of the invitation in abey-jwer-jwii4tp-ta4ker"with
union leaders.
. During the forenoon attacks on sur
face cars continued intermittently. The
last twenty-four hours have witnessed
the most extended disturbances of the
strike, police reports today showing the
arrests of twenty men declared to be
former employes. Fifteen of these are
accused of felony in attacks on trains
and cars.
Anxious to Join Strike.
Ernest Bohme, secretary of the cen
tral federated union, stated the work
ers in three unorganized orders in
New York have asked permission to
join the general strike. The employes,
he said, number about 3.500.
Bohme also said that unions out
side of New York have offered to join
I in the general strike.
"We have not encouraged this." he
! said. "We have enough to do to at
l tend to the local situation."
j William B. Fitzgerald, general or
i ganizer of the Amalgamated Associa
I tion of Klectric Railwa- Employes.
' said today:
"The ttrikp would be woi anyhow.
If the general sympathetic strike
comes, the battle will be wrin within
forty-eight hours."

There is no question but that President
Wilson will discuss at length in his

CHAMTnAITOR!
Treinos Failure to Prepare for

Report Bandits Again Are At
tacking Chihuahua.
El Paso, Texas. Sept. 20. While a
message was coming over the wire to
Juarez last night from Chihuahua city
that shots were heard outside the city
and it was feared the Villistas were
making another attack, communica
tion failed and has not yet been re
sumed. Carranza officials at Juarez refuse
to give credence to another attack,
saying the u essage probably referred
to firing Tuesday morning by excited
outposts.
Refugees from the Chihuahua capi
tal are streaming into Juarez, and all
are unanimous in their belief that
Villa will again attack the city. They
confirm early reports that the bandits
were successful in their Saturday
raid, withdrew voluntarily and took
with them field guns and ammunition
captured from the Carranzista garri
son. Is Trevlno a Villista?
Carranzista cavalry has given up
pursuit of the bandit- and returned to
Chihuahua, General Gonzales an
nounced today. Harsh criticism of
General Trevino"s failure to take pre
cautions against attack are being
directed at the commander by Car
ranza officials and adherents on the
border.
One high de facto official declared
that Trevino is either a Villista or a
coward. It is believed that First Chief
Carranza will again attempt to depose
him from command of the de facto
troops in Chihuahua. Twice before
Trevino has refused to turn over his
command to another when ordered to
do so, and ignored the orders from
Mexico City.
E. P. HARRIS VERY LOW
Veteran Kansas Printer Is Dying at

Edward P. Harris, 82 years of a pre,

recovery. Mr. Harris underwent an
operation September 8, the third in a
year, and since ihat time he has been
failing slowly.
Mr. Harris has been a resident of
Kansas for sixty years and is widely
known, not only in the state but over
the entire country. Until late in
August he kept to his work as a
proofreader for Crane & Company,
following a trip to Florida last spring.
At that time his friends tried to per

It was officially announced today
that Omaha cannot lose the W. L.

lose every remaining game while the
Ducks were winning every game, the

However, the fact that they have
the pennant cinched will not keep the
champions from trying to turn the

morrow, as arrangements already
have been made for a post-season

essential to keep up interest among

Reports to Funston Indicate
Capture of Chihuahua.
San Antonio. Sept. 20. That Fran
cisco Villa will soon cut the Carranza
line of communication between Chi
huahua City and Juarez, if he has not
already done so, was suggested by
Major General Funston today after
he had read a report on Villa's Chi
huahua engagement received from

huahua City by Villa's Saturday at
tack, and that they took station on a
large hill outside the city from neces
sity and not from choice, as previous
report said. Prom this hill they suc
ceeded by the use of artillery in dis
lodging the Villistas. General Punston
refused to give out all details of the
Bell report for publication but he said
that it confirmed previous accounts of
the battle and indicated even more se

by the Carranzistas.

'VOICES FROM AIR'

Blames Spirit Messages.
Secret Service Officials Think
Diamond Is Insane.
Pittsburg. Pa., Sept. 20. Maurice
Diamond, 62. ot.Bay City, Mich., was
held for examination by alienists at
the central police court today follow
ing his arrest for writing threatening
letters to President Wilson.
Diamond admitted, when arraigned
before. Magistrate Sweeney, that he
had written several letters in which
he told the president that he intended
to kill him.
"But I didn't want to do it." he
said. "Mysterious voices from the air
and weather bureau officials at Wash
ington and Columbus sent me spirit
messages that it was my duty. I
heeded them."
Gabriel De Fiore, of the secret
service who arrested Diamond on
Monday at 128 Washington Place, de
clared that he believed Diamond in
sane. The accused was refused audi
ence with the president in 1915, when
he sought to ask the chief ex-cutive
to interest himself in Diamond's claim
to property in Bay City. A govern
ment grant under which Diamond's
parents got the land in 1835 was de
clared invalid some years ago when a
grant dated 1832 giving title to others
was sustained in a court action.
Then began a series of letters that
grew increasingly threatening. Dia

Athens dispatch today. A Central
News dispatch said it was learned from
reliable eources that the German- and
Bulgarian staffs have left Jtonastir.
The Bulgarians have been driven from
one trench position after another, and
much of the fighting is going on. in th-.

For the first time since the Balkan
fighting began large cavalry forces are
in clash at several points along the
Serbo-Greek frontier. Serbian cavalry
is reported to have played a large part
in the capture of several villages
around Fiorina. The troopers pushed
the pursuit of the retreating Bulgars
so rapidly that they were unable to
make a stand until after they had
crossed the frontier.
Berlin dispatches today indicated
that the great battle expected to de

COST TOO GREAT

Have Regained at Great Cost
Only 3 Per Cent of Ground.
Berlin. Sept. 20. British and
French losses in the battle of the
Somme have reached about 500,000
men, the Overseas News agency esti
mates. "Recent local successes obtained by
the British on the Somme are her
alded by the English press as great
victories and even occasion a special
message from King George to the
British commander. General Sir Doug
las Haig,' say the news agency. "It
is said the British occupied the vil
lages of Fleres. Martinhuis and Cour
celette in the first day's fighting, al
tho it had been planned to take them
in the course of four days of battle.
"Nevertheless, the British were en
abled to make thia advance only after
eleven weeks of the most desperate ef
forts. The result of the battle of the
Somme should be gauged by consider
ing the amount of French and Bel
gian territory occupied by the Ger
mans, which amounts in all to about
50,000 square kilometers. Of this,
29.000 is Belgian and 21,000 French.
The efforts made by the" French and
British have resulted in the recon
quest of only 1,500 square kilometers,
or 3 per cent.

Washington, Sept. 20 Drastic plans
tending towards learning from the vic
tims of the nation-wide blackmailers
syndicate all they know regardless ot
how much testimony might publicly
soil reputations of scores of wealthy
men and women, was one of the chief
objects of the conference here today of
heads of department of Justice bu

that the very nature of the sordid
syHtem by which wealthy persons were

consent of witnesses to testify pub
licly regarding incidents which they
paid heavily to keep secret, would be
the most difficult feature of the fight
to send blackmailing ringleaders and
their confederates to jail.

GREECE GETS HOT
Sends Ultimatum to Kaiser for
Return of Soldiers.
Refusal Will Be Signal
Greece to Declare War.
for
Athens. Sept. 20. It is reported au
thentically that the Greek government
has sent an ultimatum to Germany and
Bulgaria expiring Wednesday night,
demanding the immediate return of
the soldiers taken prisoners at Kavala.
When the Greek seaport of Kaval.
was entered by German and Bulgarian
troops the city was garrisoned by the
Fourth Greek army corps. Accord
ing to an official statement issued by
Berlin, the entire corps, consisting of
20.000 men, asked the German com
mander for food and shelter and pro
tection against the entente forces. The
statement said that to prevent anv
breach of neutrality the Greek soldiers
would be transported to Germany ti
be kept there as guests of the nation.
Number Taken I'nccrtain.
The German account of the affair
differs radically from that given out
at the allied capitals and from stories
sent out from Athens. The number
of soldiers transported to Germany,
according to these versions, was less
than a thousand, one account placing
the total at seventy officers and 800
men. The remainder of the garrison
is variously said to have been trans
ported to Saloniki by the French au
thorities, and to be encamped on the
island of Thasos. A recent dispatch
from Athens reported the arrival of
some members of the Kavala garrison
at the Greek capital but no numbers
wore given.
The incident caused a Drofound sen
sation in Greece and the action of thj
Germans was bitterly denounced by
the pro-ally party. Immediately after
Premier Kalogeropoulos took office, e.
news dispatch from Athens said he in tended
to demand the return of the
Greek soldiers from Germany and iha.
refusal of this demand would be the
signal for the entry into the war ot
Greece on the side of the entente
