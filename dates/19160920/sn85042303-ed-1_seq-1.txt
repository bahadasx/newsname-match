Al the regular meeting of the Doard

petition was presented by nearly all
the residents of A street, northwest,

H. K. Foster, manager of the Ard
more Ice, Light & Power company,
submitted plans that have been pre
pared by the company for the in
stallation of a white way. The plans
were taken under advisement, but
Ihcy are of such a nature that every
one who has been Interviewed who
have seen them state that the city
is extremely fortunate in getting such
a favorable proposition submitted.
The plans call for the extension of the
white way along Main street as far
as K street, beyond Central park.
From the Santa Fe on Broadway to C
street, near the Kite of the proposed
convention hall, and on Washington
street between Main and Broadway.

ter will be presented to the people for
their approval at a special election
