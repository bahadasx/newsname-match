Berne, Switzerland, Sept. 19.—A stir­
ring old picture of life in Switzerland
as it used to be hangs in one of tbe
galleries here. It shows a village
roused at night by the war alarm.
The signal is burning on the bund
spitz, or alarm station, that overlooks
the valley, and the people are rush­
ing from their bouses, the men arm­
ing themselves as they come.
That was the war summons, right
enough, In those days. The moment
an invader set foot in the land the
fires flashed from hill to hill like tbe
fiery cross of Scotland, and the stern
Swiss warriors came out to fight.
The bundspitzen are still there, the
alarm signal tripod is on each of
them, as every traveler knows and
the people, you may say, still sleep
on their arms, but other things have
changed.
At ten minutes past midnight on
August 1, 1914, the Swiss government,
for the first time, sent out the war
alarm or fiery cross in its modern
shape. It was an order by telegraph
mobilizing the Swiss army, and in
two hours it had reached every sta­
tion in the country.
At the word, government officers in
every city, town and village went
forth to post up the notices prepared
for such an emergency, and to wake
the people, in some cases with the
telephones and in others with the
fire engines.
Ey six o'clock men began to issue
from their homes, fully uniformed and
fully equipped, each with his rifle. At
half past seven the ranks in the towns
and cities were full, every man know­
ing his place and falling into it auto­
matically. Before nine o'clock the
trains that were ready and waiting on
the government railroads began to
move the troops toward the frontier.
In sparsely settled rural regions,
wnere the meeting places were far
off, more time was required, but by
nightfall, 300,000 soldiers were on
the border or nearing it, and at seven
o'clock the morning of August 2. prac­
tically the entire active army of
Switzerland, 400,000 men, was in its
positions guarding the boundary lines.
A few hours before and they had been
working in the fields, factories, and
stores!
This beat all the records of quick
mobilization. It beat even the Ger­
mans. with all their deserved fame
for efficiency and preparation. All
the other nations of Europe were mo­
bilizing. None of them mobilized so
swiftly and efficiently as the Swiss.
Four hundred thousand men, fully
equipped, at their posts in SO hours,
was the record of Switzerland.
If I remember rightly, 30,000 men
in 30 days was the record of the
United States militia when called out
by the Mexican crisis.
The 400,000 trained, equipped and
efficient troops of Switzerland cost a
little more than one-half as much
as the 30,000 untrained troops of the
United States.
Our system, put to the test, filled
us with chagrin and disgust the
Swiss system, put to the test, worked
with the precision of a steamship's
engines.<p></p>MEIO

New York, Sept. 19.—The most

were made .to run cars on the 42nd

Mobs of strikers and their sympa­

powering the police and putting to
flight all railway employes in the vi­
cinity.
Several motormen and conductors,
who had not joined the strikers,
were beaten. Much damage had been
done before police reserves arrived.
The police assert that the strikers
took advantage of the fact that many
policemen were detailed to polling
booths in today's primary election
here. Disorder occurred in many
places at the same time.

would use the weapon against herself
and refused to give it to her.
