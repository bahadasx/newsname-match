Kvi'ii nt That.
William A. Williams, keeper of the
city pesthouse, is the latest police
man to be enrolled on the books of
the city. Williams, however, enjoys
the distinction of being the first man
who has voluntarily offered to pay
tho city for the privilege of bolr.g an
officer Instead of receiving a regular
monthly stipend like the rest oil the
burly "coppers".
Williams got a commission M a
special officer for the purpose of ar
resting delinquent automobile owners
who have negloctcd to pay tholr 1916
auto tax. He will work In this ca
pacity under J. H. Mathers, special
state agent.
For every arrest he will receive a
fee of $2, aocordlng to the Bgreementl
Of this amount he promised to turn
over to tho city the sum of 50 conts.
In other words,, Williams not only
makes his victims pay for the privi
lege of being arrested, but he consid
ers the act to be such a good one that
he turns over a part of the money se
cured as "conscience" niemey on his
part for the privilege of making the
arrest.

of her trial in the municipal court
yc-.ferday afternoon.
In rplte of the efforts of her at
torney to have her ease set aside) on
constitutional grounds, the woman was
Convicted of having In her possesrelo'i
a largo quantity of various kinds if
"dope," presumably with the inten
tion of selling the same. I
The woman was arrested at he T I
rooming houso, 4 North Ciminniilll
avenuo,. nbout 8 o'clock Saturday 1
night, September 16. The officer.!,
after placing tho woman under iir
resf, entered the house and sexirchuU
her room.
I'nder the floor they found a cache
containing two lare fruit Jars com
pletely filled with morphine and
Cocalno In hot ties, most of Uioin
sealed.
The woman testified on the stand
that she had purchased the stuff In
St. Louis before the parsing of tho
strlngont drug act on the part of tho
t;nlted Ptates authorities. She furthur
testified that the stuff was only for
her personal us. She explulnea the
unusual amount by the fact that she
did not Intend to get any more on
account of the scarcity due to the new
law.
She contended that she had been a
constant user of the drug for several
years, but that recently she had tried
to reduoe the amount of the drug until
she was taking but a fraction of her
former dose. Her nttorney made hor
state several times on the stand that
tho oplat were for her own use, and
that sho had not Intended to dispose
of them.
It was upon this testimony that the
defense built its argument and brought
out Its case.
Twelve bottles, each containing a
largo amount of morphine sulphate In
the powdered form, were Introduced
by the city as evidence. The bottles
were valued at $10 each, considering
the present value of the "dope",
A bottle containing a large amount
of cocaine grains was also Introduced
as addlltonal envldenoe,
The defense oontended that the
woman was allowed to have the stuff
for her own personal use, according
to her constitutional lights. The city
contended by the ordinance that the
possession of a contraband article
when proved, assured a inv1ction.
