EXPLAINS NEW ORDER.
London, Sept II.?Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of war trade, today
explained the recent orders of the
jprUlah government refusing to allow
Holland to accept further consign
meats of American goods snd refusing
letters of assurance that American
shipments would reach Scandinavia.
Re said the orders applied only to
certain prohibited articles and not to
trade la general.
I * Qeeat Britain has forbidden the ex?
port of various article* to Buropean
neutral? on the ground that they have
I % already received In the tlrat seven
months of this year more than an or- (
I denary year's aupply. Lord Robert
said It was not logical to forbid auch
I exports from Great Br'taln and to
I permit them from America and other
neutral countries.
He explained that one neutral na
I lion, taking normally 18,000 tons of
I coffee, in seven months of this year
I already had Imported ?0,000 tons, so
ell further imports of coffee to that
country are looked upon as likely to
reach an enemy destination. The list
of prohibited articles, he said, varies
with different countries, according to
what they already had imported, all
allowance* being made for Im
formerly made to German ports.

Likely That Fourth District Repre?

Against Greenville Man.
Washington, .Sept. 15.?Interesting
developments are promised at an ear?
ly date over the Greenville postofllce
appointment.
Representative Sam J. Nlchoils said
today:
"I have already stated that the ac?
tion of the postmaster general was a
complete surprise to me. You may
rest assured that I will do everything
la my power to put Mr. Traxlor out.
I have net fully decided upon the best
course to pursue in the matter, tut
I expect to go to the bottom of it.
Further than this I do not . care to
make any statement at the present
I titae."
In 1813 thei e was an agreement
I among the meiibore of the South
[Carolina delegation In congress, the
house members *nd the two senators
agreeing, that the house members
would have the naming of the post?
masters In thcii respective districts
and that the se lators would not in?
terfere except where recommenda?
tions were personally objectionable.
This agreement sjas been strictly ad?
hered to and the question that Mr.
Nlchoils will ask lust as soon as Post

Washington Is who Mr. Traxler s
sponsor was.
It is not knonn that either Senator
Smith or Senator Till man took a hand
In the present situation and it is in?
teresting to know who did. ,
With the elimination of the South
Carolina senators, there remains the
question of who It was with sufficient

pUt FOR PARTY SUPPORT.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEMOCRATIC
CAMPAIGN FUND SOLICITED.
Appeal by Chairman L. D. Jennings,
Who Cites Benefits of Wilson Ad?
ministration to South.
To the Democrats of ?South Carolina:
Some timo ago, I was appointed by
the treasurer of the national Demo?
cratic committee chairman of the na?
tional finance committee of this
State and I am today in receipt of a
[^telegram from the chairman of the
national finance committee, urging
fthat funds be collected and forward?
ed as early as possible, as the com?
mittee is very much in need of money.
I am taking this method of bringing
this matter before as many Democrats
as possible.
The reason why wc should con
| tribute to this fund to, aid in the le
Igitimate expenses of the reelection of
Irresident Wilson are too numerous to
mention, and I will refer to only a
tow.
- The enactment of the law estab?
lishing the federal reserve banks,
I ought, within itself, to be sufficient to
?prompt every Democrat in So?.th Car
fpiina to contribute in proportion to
his means to this fund. I feel con?
fident that if it had not been tor this
|new banking system, our cotton crop
of 1916 would not have brought half
e price which it did. This removed
from Wall street the absolute con?
trol of the money market. If the Re?
publicans are restored to power, they
ill undoubtedly amend the banking
,w so as to give to Wall street the
control of the money of the country.
Not only this, but the president
has so far steered the country clear
?t war, and if ho has- been able ot do
J$fcls under the conditions which have
Ircady arisen, do you not feel con
lent that he will be able to do so
dor the conditions which may arise
the future, as it is hard to con
e how complications in the future
arise which would be more
:'xor: war, thl^ftvaa WrOu?
boys have been spared. Is hot this,
within Itself, a sufficient reason why
we should be liberal in contributing
to this fund, for the purpose of de?
fraying the necessary campaign ex?
penses and rcelecting President Wil?
son Not only for the good of the
fsouth, but for the good of the whole
nation, in fact, for the good of hu?
manity the world over
As we all know, it is impossible to
carry on national campaigns without
funds, We should contribute in pro?
portion to our means. A man may
be ever so good a Democrat and may
be of limited means and not able to
contribute more than one dollar,
while on the other hand, another may
be equally as good a Democrat, and
may be able to contribute $1,000.
Each should contribute in proportion
to his means and thereby aid in sav?
ing the nation from Republican rule.
As stated above, the need of this
fund is urgent, the necessity is great
and I hope that each and every one
who sees this, will at once mail me
a check for such an amount as he
feels able to contribute for this cause,
and for the gocd of humanity the
world over.
L. D. Jennings,
State Chairman of the Finance Com?
mittee of the National Democratic
Party.

tween County und State by Com

Columbia, Sept. 16.?The State

! various county treasurers the sum of
$31,962.37, this being tho amount of
j additional license fees collected from
I insurance companies doing business
in this State for the semi-annual pe?
riod ending June 30, 1916.
Previous to the establishment of
the insurance department, each in?
surance company paid to each county
treasurer the taxes on premiums
collected in that county. Generally

000 or $42,000 was so collected by the
various county treasurers. That law
having been declared unconstitu?
tional, the duty was put upon the in-?
sura nee commissioner to distribute to
the various county treasurers one-half

ed. The insurance commissioner so
collects and distributes about $60,000
In two semi-annual collections. One

Dillon, Sept. 16.?/ 0 fcport of the
grand jury, which f ftn examining
the affairs of the T ^"/county offices,
made today, lnv / the issuing of
a bench warro r C. G. Bruce,
county auditor, o. charges of misap?
propriating county funds; the resigna?
tion of William C. Mclnnis, county
treasurer, and the recommendation
that a competent man be appointed to
succeed him, and a reprimand for the
sheriff and the county attorney.
The grand jury completed its re?
port and it was read by the solicitor
late this afternoon in the court room
before a large number of people who
were eager to hear it.
Except for a small number of cler?
ical errors with no intentional wrong?
doing the clerk of court's office was
found to be all right. Some sugges?
tions were made as to the method cf
keeping record of receipts of his of?
fice. The judge of probate's office
was found to be all right and this
officer was commended for the man?
ner in which his records were kept.
The supervisor's and county commit ?
stoners' books were found to be all
right except for the sale of meichnn
dlse sold by themselves to the county,
which practice was condemned,
though it was felt from the investiga?
tion that the county had lost no
money by the transaction. The super?
intendent of education's office was
found to be all right except the meth?
od in handling entries of funds and
disbursements to the trustees and su?
perintendents of the Latta, Dillon and
Pages Mill school. The auditor's
found that he allowed overdrafts of
different school districts at the close
of the scholastic years to be covert
by trustees and individuals and
they were carried till the begil
of the succeeding terras at sjr)
not lost any money by such
though it was advised against in the
future.
The sheriff's office had been short,
but the sheriff. made good all but
$1,405.97, which he claimed he was
not responsible for. He was repri?
manded for his negligence and asked
to keep better records and to collect
the delinquent taxes and to keep up
with the receipts and to make his
entries properly.
The county treasurer's office was
not gone into very deeply, though it
was found that he had not used any
of the county's funds himself. He
having resigned, the governor was
urged to appoint some one to succeed
him whose^ efficiency would not be
questioned.
The county attorney, it was found,
had not paid his taxes for 1012 and
1913, and part of the taxes of the
Hugh Price estate of 1913, he being a
trustee of the estate. The report
states that the county attorney did
wrong in so doing by inducing a coun?
ty officer to violate the law by not
issuing an execution on him for them.
The county attorney, however, ex?
plained his course on the ground of
the depression and said that he was
not able to pay the taxes. He by his
explanation sought to exonerate the
county officer of all blame.
A bench warrant was issued late
this evening as a result of the findings
in the county auditor's office. This
was done upon the recommendation
of the grand jury. It was found that
C. G. Bruce, the auditor, had misap?
propriated to his own use the amount
of $1,405.97 and the further sum of
$3,163.81.
The master's office was found to be
all right and his books properly kept.
Sent to the Governor.
W. Mclnnis yesterday tendered his
resignation as treasurer of Dillon
county. The resignation was forward?
ed to (low Manning at Washington.
BRITISH CAPTtJMB TRENCHES.
London, Sept. 18.?The British
made additional gains on the Somme
front last night, but the general situa?
tion remains unchanged. The British
line advanced farther east of Cource
lettc. German trenches were captur?
ed south of Thiepval. The enemy en?
tered a British trench weft of Moquet,
but were repulsed. The enemy suffer?
ed heavy losses.
The Willie Bethune trial will com?

the supreme court. This is a much
appealed case and has created a great
deal of Interest. ^
