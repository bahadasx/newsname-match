I
President and Chairman Mc
Cormick Are Mapping Out
Program.
MR. WILSON WILL NOT
MAKE CAMPAIGN TOUR
Executive's Activities to Be Confined
to Addresses Before Non-Partisan
Bodies and at Shadow Lawn.
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Sep
tember 20.?President Wilson and
Vance C. McCormick, democratic
national chairman, mapped out
here today a program for meeting
the campaign attacks of Charles
E. Hughes on the railroad eight
hour law.
Asserting: that the democrats would
show that the President placed before
Congress a complete program to meet
the recently threatened strike by railway
employes. Mr. McCormick asserted that
Mr. Wilson is prepared to urge strongly
during the next session of Congress
the enactment of this program.
When the entire plan of the President
is fully understood the people of the
country will join in praising Mr. Wil
son. the chairman said. The repub
licans, he declared, seem to ignore ev
erything in the program except the
one item passed by the Congress. Mr.
McCormick added that It would be1
shown clearly how the President plans'
to minimize the possibility of a repe
tition of the railroad situation which
arose recently.
Arranging Engagements.
The chairman was not ready today to j
announce any additional speaking ar-1
rangements for Mr. Wilson, but said!
that correspondence had been begun
regarding several engagements. He
plant* to return here next Tuesday for
another conference with the President.
President Wilson has no intention of
making any campaign tour, but he will
carry put plans already tentatively
made for several speeches on public
questions before non-partisan organi
sations.
In addition to the speeches in differ
ent parts of the country, the President
plans to make addresses on the porch
of Shadow Lawn to delegations from
various states which will call upon
him. The first of these speeches will
be made Saturday afternoon to a dele-*
gation of business men, with whom
Mr. Wilson will discuss the record of
business legislation made by his ad
ministration.
With Chairman McCormick, the Presi
dent planned the general trend of his
addresses. In them he will avoid per
sonalities, and confine himself strictly
to pressing public questions. He will
discuss the settlement of the recently
threatened railroad strike, which
Charles E. Hughes has made an issue
in the campaign.
Will Speak in Baltimore.
Preparation of the, speech the Presi
dent will deliver next Monday at Balti
more before the convention of the Na
tional Grain Dealers* Association has
been begun. In it Mr. Wilson will re
fer particularly to the rural credits
bill passed by Congress.
Among the messages received by Mr.
Wilson was one from Representative
Doremus, chairman of the democratic
congressional committee, expressing
confidence over the political outlook
from a democratic standpoint.
Mr. McCormick denied emphatically
reports that democratic leaders are
alarmed over the political situation.
He said that during his middle western
trip he found strong democratic senti
ment. He predicted that within a few
days the democratic campaign will be
in full swing, and that the republicans
will be on the defensive.
MANGANESE ORES SCARCE.
Further Handicap to This Country if
War Continues, XT. S. Official Sayi.
BISBEE, Aria, September 20.?A fur
ther handicapping of the chemical in
dustries and the paint and dye manu
facturing Interests of the country, due
to a lack of manganese ores, was pre
dicted here today during convention
cessions of the American Institute of
Mining Engineers. This statement was
contained In a paper by E. C. Harder
of the United States geological survey
presented to the institute members for
discussion.
Mr. Herder's treatise explained that
a*en at the beginning of the European
war there had been a great decrease in
imports of both ores and alloy* of
manganese, and that slnoe 1914 the
price had risen frpm 137 a ton to $100
a ton with ferromanganese selling con
siderably higher.
Said Mr. Harder: "The situation in
the United States at the present time
regarding the supply of manganese
ores and alloys cf manganese is one of
great seriousness, and is likely to be^
come increasingly so while the Eu
ropean war continues. The dependence
Of th? country upon foreign countries
for this supply is being forcibly in
dicated."
BAPS POLITICAL CONDITIONS.
West Virginia Judge Calls on Grand
Jury to Investigate.
MARTINSBURG. W. Va.. September
20.?A sensation has been caused here
ss a result of the instructions given
by Judge John M. Woods, presiding
officer of the circuit court, to the
grand Jury to investigate the political
situation in Berkeley county. He as
serted that election conditions in the
county had become intolerable, and de
clared that a careful analysis led him
to believe that out of 6,700 registered
voters of the county the votes of ap
proximately 2,200. or afcout one-third,
were purchaseable.
Judge Woods said that elections had
degenerated into an auction wherein
the candidates with the most money
were able to elect themselves to office.

Athens Reports Demand for
the Immediate Release of
Kavala Prisoners.
NEW POLICY SAID TO BE
SANCTIONED BY THE KING
"Decision in Principle" to Depart
From Neutrality to Allay Dis
trust of Entente.
ATHENS, Tuesday, September
19. via London, September 20.?
There is reason to believe that the
Greek government has sent an ul
timatum to Germany and Bul
garia, expiring Wednesday night,
demanding the immediate return
of the soldiers taken prisoner at
Kavala.
Departure From Neutrality.
LONDON, September 20, 2:32 p.m.?A
Heuter dispatch from Athens, under
[ date of Septert^ber 19, says:
| "It is learned on good authority that
I this morning's conference of Premier
I Kalogeroypoulos and the foreign min
j ister w^th King Constantine resulted in
j a decision in principle for a departure
from neutrality with a view to dissi
pating the entente's apparent distrust
| of the new cabinet." >
Reuters Telegram Company says It
learns officially that the Greek govern
i ment has submitted a very urgent note
to Germany regarding the removal to
Germany of Greek troops from Kavala,
and demanding that they be released.
According to special dispatches from
Athens, the German, Austrian, Bul
garian and Turkish ministers have
called on the new foreign minister. The
diplomatic representatives of the en
tente powers, however, still await in
structions from their governments and
have not yet entered into relations
with the new cabinet.
Greek Soldiers "Guests,"
When the Gree]; seaport of Kavala j
was entered by German and Bulgarian
troops the city was garrisoned by the
4th Greek Army Corps. According to
an official statement issued by Berlin,
the entire corps, consisting of 20,000
men, asked the German commander for
food and shelter and protection against
the entente forces. The statement said
that to prevent any breach of neutral
ity the Greek soldiers would be trans
ported to Germany, to be kept there as
guests of the nation.
The German account of the affair dif
fers radically from that given out at
the allied capitalsand from stories sent
out from A|PMK^H>s numbers of sol
diers transported to Germany, accord
ing to these versions, was less than
1,000, one account placing the total at
seventy officers and 800 men.
Mystery as to Others.
The remainder of the garrison is
variously said to have been transported"
to Saloniki by the French authorities
and to be encamped on the Island of
Thasos. A recent dispatch from Athens
reported the arrival of some members
of the Kavala garrison In the Greek
capital, but no numbers were given
The incident caused a profound sen
sation in Greece and the action of the
Germans was bitterly denounced by
the pro-ally party. Immediately after
Premier Kalogeropoulos took office
news dispatches from Athens said he
intended to demand the return of the
Greek soldiers from Germany and that
refusal of this demand would be the
| signal for the entry into thev war of
Greece on the side of the entente.

the fall fashions, says the semi-annual j
report of the Silk Association of Amer- I

season, is the prediction. Paris fash- |
ions, it is asserted, have not favored

tionably has increased the demand for

ALLIES' LOSSES IN SOMME
500,000, BERLIN CLAIMS
Casualties Out of All Proportion to
Gains, Says Semi-Official
Statement.
BERLIN, September A, by wireless to
Sayville, N. Y.?British and French
losses in the battle of the Somme have
reached about 500,000 men, the Overseas
News Agency estimates.
"Recent local successes obtained by
the British on the Somme are heralded
by the English press as great victories,
and even occasioned a special message
from King George to the British com
mander, Gen. Sir Douglas Haig," says
the news agency. "It is said the British
occupied the villages of Flers, Martin
puich and Courcelette in the first day's
fighting, although it had been planned
to take them in the course of four days
of battle.
"Nevertheless the British were en
abled to make this advance only after
eleven weeks of the most desperate ef
forts. The result of the battle of the
Somme should be gauged by consider
ing the amount of French and Belgian
territory occupied by the Germans,
which amounts in all to about 50.000
square kilometers. Of this 29,000 is
Belgian and 21,000 French. The efforts
made by the French and British have
resulted in the reconquest of only
1,500 square kilometers, or 3 per cent.
"The price paid for this territory is
appalling. According to a conserva
tive estimate the British lost 250,000
men up to September 15. This, to
gether with the French losses, brings
ud the total to about half a million
men."

WANTS AN EAELY REPLY.
American Government Would Trans
port Women From Palestine.
The American embassies at Constan- i
tinople and Paris were directed today
to ask that the Turkish and French
governments hasten their reply to the
State Department's request for per-1
mission to have a number of woman j
and child refugees from Palestine
leave Jaffa on the United States |
cruiser Des Moines, now en route there
with medical supplies donated by
American Jewish relief societies for
sufferers in Jerusalem.
The Des Moines sailed yesterday from
Algiers for Alexandria, where she will
be held until the Turkish and French
governments are heard from. The plan
is to have the rei^fgees taken by the
cruiser to an Italian port for transpor
tation to America on a passenger liner.
Nicaragua Quiet as Election Nears.
Admiral Caperton. commanding the
Pacific lleet, advised the Navy Depart
ment today that there was little, It any,

SAYTHEYARESURE
Republican Managers Count
on 300 Votes in the Elec
toral College.
Although democratic campaign mana
gers seemed to hold the field of pulblic
attention by means of publicity dis
seminated during the t>ast ten days, the
republican managers bucked up today
and claimed the election of Hughes with
an electoral college vote of 300.
Offices of the various republican or
ganizations here in Washington have
been extremely chary about claiming
specific states and have withheld from
public gaze all sorts of important and
unimportant information concerning lo
cal conditions in various communities.
However, leaders of the G. O. P. in va
rious states have been asked to approxi
mate the results of the coming election.
Some of these leaders promptly replied
that their states would be lost to the
party, which cast more or less gloom
in the camp and was responsible for a
blue feeling which prevailed around re
publican headquarters up to a few days
ago.
L?ater, when full returns came in, the
gloom was dispelled, and predictions now
are being made by republicans that
Hughes will have 300 votes in the elec
toral college, where 266 will elect him.
Tabular Statement.
Republican senators here say that
the fight has been fought and that few
votes will be changed between now
and election time. They have prepared
tables which show the way in which
the G. O. P. believes the tide will turn.
These tables are as follows:
Democratic states and votes?Ala

What the Figures Mean.
These figures mean to republicans that

outright and will not admit it to be doubt

REPORTED PLAN TO GIVE
POPE TEMPORAL POWER
Agitation Said to Have Been Started
by Catholic Newspapers
in Germany.
LONDON, September 20, 3:15 p.m. A
movement in favor of re-establishment
of the temporal power of the Pope is
reported by the Amsterdam correspond
ent of the Exchange Telegraph Com
pany to have been inai)gurated by
Roman Catholic newspapers of Ger
many, with the idea of drawing the
Vatican wholly away from Italian In
fluence. The Cologne Volkszeitung, a
prominent Catholic newspaper, is quot
ed as saying Germany gives a free
hand to German Catholics, and as de
nouncing the law of papal guarantees
.y e Italtan government in
1870. at the time of the ending of the
temporal sovereignty of the Pope.
All Austrian and German Catholic
papers are following this lead, the dis
patch says. It adds that the movement
is believed to have been inaugurated
by Cardinal Hartmann, archbishop of
Cologne, with the idea of gaining rep
resentations for the Vatican at the
peace conference after the war.

NEW LONDON. Conn., September 20.
?Further consideration of the various
plans suggested for the control of the
border figured today In the conference
of the Mexican-American Joint com
missioners. It was not expected any
plan suggested would be adopted soon
for recommendation to the two gov
ernments, and It appeared probable
that notwithstanding the reluctance of
the Mexican members to discuss the
internal affairs of their country, such
questions as the American commis
sioners consider related to the gen
eral situation would be taken up.
Suggested Banking System.
A plan for a Mexican national bank
ing system to take the place of the
suspended national bank and the
Bank of London and Mexico, In Mexico
City, has been outlined to the Ameri
can members by Luis Cabrera, chair
man of the Mexican members.
Mr. Cabrera said the two banks had
issued bank notes far in excess of their
metallic reserve, an<t recently had re
fused to sell to the government ex
change on foreign banks at rates de
manded by the government. The in
stitutions had been ordered to show a
metallic reserve equivalent to their
Issue of paper money, he said^
Says Step Is Retaliatory.
Mr. Cabrera added that the step was
largely retaliatory, as the banks of
Mexico, chiefly the two In question,
were responsible for depreciation of
Garranza currency.

BERLIN, September 20, via
London, 5:22 p.m.?Rumanian
forces which invaded Transyl
vania through the Czurduk pass
of the Transylvanian Alps have
been defeated and driven back
over the pass, the war office an
nounced today.
Stubborn and fluctuating bat
tles are going on in the province
of Dobrudja between Russo
Rumanian forces and German
and Bulgarian troops, says to
day's German official statement.
The Russians and Rumanians
have hastily brought up rein
forcements, the statement adds,
and are defending their positions
with great stubbornness.
Fighting on Huge Scale.
LONDON, September 20. ? Fighting
on a huge scale is in progress along
the eastern war front, whenco the cen
ter of interest has shifted following
the let-up in the heavy allied attacks
along the Somme in,.the west.
Evidence is accumulating that the
central powers are now devoting their
main attention to the campaigns in the
east, concentrating large forces against
Rumania, notably under Field Marshal
von Mackensen in Dobrudja, and put
ting all possible available men In the
field to stop the Russian march on
Lemberg by way of Halic*. and the
menacing drives of the Russians and
Rumanians in the Carpathians and
Transylvania.
GTeat Battle in Dobrudja.
Both Berlin and Sofia report the ds
velopment of a great battle on the Hue
the Russians arrd the Rumanians hare
taken up in Dobrudja to defend the rail
road route into Interior Rumania from
Constanza, on the Black sea. The en
gagement, they declare, is turning in
favor of the force of the central pow
ers. under von Mackensen.
Latest reports from the fighting In
Galicia and Volhynia show the Teu
tonic forces on the offensive and claim
ing decided advantages over the Rus
sian armies ander Gen. Brusailoff.
Petrograd Is Silent.
As has frequently been the case when
decisive developments were lacking,
Petrograd today is silent regarding the
operation^ along the Russian front, re
porting merely that there have been no
important happenings.
Turkish troops, which appear to have
played an important part in stiffening
the lines of the Teutonic allies in the
east, have been successful in the reoent x
fighting fn Galicia, Constantinople an
nounced today. A forty-eight-hour bat
tle with superior Russian forces result
ed in the Turks completely maintaining
their positions.
In Macedonia the trend of the cam
paign appears to favor the entente
armies. The Serbians are reported in
a continued advance along the west
ern end of the line, driving the re
maining Bulgarians out of Fiorina
capturing the highest peak In the
Kaimakcalan range n^orth of T^ijfre Os
trcrvo. Sofia, however, denies the suc
cess claimed for the Serbians in
Kaimakcalan region.
Apprehension for BumanleML
The situation of the Rumanian
armies on both the fronts, in Transjrl
vania and Dobrudja, is giving rise to
some apprehension here, although the
news of the latest events comes large
ly from enemy sources and therefore
Is taken with certain reserve.
"It seems possible," says the Times
today, "that the Russo-Rumanian
forces in Dobrudja may soon be in need
of help. The actual position of affairs
in Transylvania is equally uncertain.
? ? ? Why did Rumania allow herself
to leave her Dobrudja front inadequate
ly protected? The fact is that Rumania
had no wish to quarrel with Bulgaria.
She did not declare war on Bulgaria,
fend to this day Bulgaria has not offi
cially declared war on Rumania.
Hint of Assassination.
"But the situation w?ls apparently
stamped by Field Marshal Ton Mack
ensen, with the connivance of King
Ferdinand of Bulgaria and M. Radon
lavoff, the Bulgarian premier. The Bul
garian chief of staff. Gen. Jostoff, died ?
mysteriously, and is now believed to
have been murdered. The Bulgarian
staff was then superseded and the Bul
garian army became merely a wing of
the German army, with Field
von Mackensen in control. ? ? ?
"There are two manifest comments on
the situation. The first is, if the Ru
manians need direct and immediate
help, the allies must spare no efforts to
supply It, and the second is thatItke
sooner Gen. Sarrai^ oommaodsr of the
forces In Macedonia, fte master of Jfso
astlr the better?for nothing will ss
