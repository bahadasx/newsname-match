ENTERTAIN CROWDS
All in Readiness for Dare Devil
Aviator Who Will Thrill
Fair Crowds.
We mounted our trusty bicycle on
Tuesday afternoon ana headed for the
Kandiyohi county fair grounds, bent
on interviewing Charles T. (better
we arrived he was busily engaged in
the preliminary process of "building
up" the hydroplane with which he ex
pects to thrill the thousands of fair
visitors the last three das ot the
eek I
Being a little timid as to whether
the bird man cared to talk about him-,
self, or not, we approached rather
cautiously, but were soon put at ease I
by the manner in which Mills answer
ed the questions asked of him.
"How long does it take you to put
that thing together each time you do I
it?" was the first question asked.
"O, there's about six hours' work
to it." he replied, as he sat on the
ground, smearing water proof glue
over a square piece of canvas, prepar-1
atory to putting a patch on the top
plane.
"Down at Albert Lea last week," he I
continued, "I stopped under some
trees, and the branches tore thru the
cloth."
"What kind of cloth do you use on
the planes, canvas?" we next asked
him.
"We started out to use Irish linen,"
replied the D. D., "but when the war
broke out, it was impossible to get
that, so now we use unbleached mus
lin."
"Some motor on that machine isn't
it," he was asked.
"Well rather," was the reply. "I
wouldn't sell that motor for love or
money. Seventy horse power, and
she'll pull it, too. Maximotor, manu
factured at Detroit, Mich. If any one
wants a good bargain in a hydroplane,
I'll sell them this one cheap, but not
the motor."
"You must see a lot of the world
around the way you do,"
some one asked him.
"O.yes, I see my share of it all
right," was the answer. "I had in
tended to run a school of instruction
in aviation this year, but started out
the tenth day of June, to fly at var
ious fairs and exhibitions, and have
been at it ever Bince. The only day
I have missed a flight that I was
scheduled for, this summer, was last
week at Albert Lea. The day was
nasty, and the crowd was small, so I
called it off. Since I started I have
traveled thru ten states.
Continuing the aviator told that
this was to be his last flight in the
hydro-plane this year. After leaving
here on Saturday night, the remaind
er of the flights are to be made from
an aeroplane. He carries wheels right
with him on his travels from place to
place and it is an easy matter to take
the plane from the pontoon base and
place it on the wheels.
Flying a hydro-plane is a lot hard
er work, and a lot more risky busi
ness than aviating in an aeroplane.
The former is heavier and there is
more chance for an accident than
with the lighter "land flyer."
Mills finished setting the machine
up this afternoon, and everything is
in readiness for his first flight Thurs
day afternoon.

INTERESTING ITEMS
FROM HIGH SCHOOL
News Notes of Interest Gathered
By Our Correspondent at
the Local School.
The high school will not have a
booth at the fair this season but the
Grades will have a bird exhibit. A
new and good idea.
On Wednesday and Thursday only
one session will be held from 8 a.m.
to 12:40 p. m., in order that the pu
pils may attend the Fair.
Next Saturday the football team
will play their first game of this sea
son. It will be played with the Litch
field team on their field. Let the
Willmaf boys return with all honors
won.
Four new members have been add
ed to the faculty, namely: Miss Hull
(Science) Miss Randall, (English)
Mr. Melby, (Norse and History) and
Mr. Youngquist, (Swedish and His
tory.)
Two hundred fifty-seven pupils are
now enrolled for the regular high
school course. Of these thirteen are
taking the Normal Course and have
the east room of the Third floor of
the Central building.
Because of State regulations, this
is the last year a pupil can take the
Normal Course instead of the fourth
year high school work. Hereafter the
department will be open to high
school graduates only and a more ad
vanced course will be given.
Second day of school in History
class:
Mr. Foster (noticing two pupils had
dropped History): Ah, where are the
others? This must be the cream of
the class.
Eddie: And the test is very poor.
On Tuesday of this week Miss Jen
ness assigned the pupils their reg
ular seats. It became necessary to
have some of the Freshmen and Soph
omores sit two in a seat. Room 6 is
also seated with Freshmen. Anyone
can realize the inconveniences of hav
ing two pupils sitting in one seat.
They are crowded and there is
scarcely enough room for their books
in the desk and these become mixed
up in the course of the day's work.
It makes it harder for the Principal
to take care of the pupils under these
conditions than if she could have
them all in one room and all in each
their own place.
GERMAN—The First Year German
Class have a change of text, studying
Bacon's New German Grammar, which
contains some reading matter as well
as the German work It also uses
conversational German more than the
texts used in previous years, thus
making the work more interesting
and profitable for the pupils. The en
rollment in this class has reached 32.
There are 46 pupils in the German II.
classes, studying "Hoher als die
Kircke," a story of young lives in a
Medieval German city. Once a week
composition and grammar work are
taken up. This work is based on Al
len's First German Composition and
on grammar references.—Miss Rade

The Fair Board has made a deal for
the Frost property west of the fair
grounds, which contains three and a
half acres. It has perhapa the finest
beach on Foot Lake and la wail wood
ed and has a grass sward. ThJa piece
of ground was a natural part of the
fairgrounds and its purchase gives
the Kandiyohi County Fair park the
entire peninsula in Foot lake. It will
give the fair this year the additional
room needed for parking automobiles.
The work of moving the fairground
fence was begun at once and will be
completed this morning.
New London has posters out an
nouncing that Saturday will be New
London Day at the fair. The New
London Concert Band will furnish the
music on that day and it is expected
that a tour of cars will leave New
London at nine o'clock to accompany
the band. A special pennant will be
given each car which participates.
New London never does anything by
halves and you may be sure they will
make some showing at the fair on Sat
urday.
The farm club booths are given the
place of honor in the center of the
exposition hall this year. The chibs
represented are Green Lake, Sunny
side, Svea, Goldenrod and South Ed
wards.
Carey's Giant Amusement Company
arrived here from Hopkins, where
they had played at the Hennepin
County Fair. They will furnish the
carnival features of the fair.

good condition as this year. The
horsemen are delighted with it, and
promise some fine speed events.
