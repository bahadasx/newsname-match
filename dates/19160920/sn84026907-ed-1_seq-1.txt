T? My Fe?lo#Citizens: ,
Now thatl>ekeat an(* excitement <
of the campfe? are over; since the 1
issues haveleen settled for the time 1
being and lfe at their regular
pursues, I wish to express my ?
profound gratitude to the good i
people of Ais county wh? voted for (
end supposed me in the elections
inc* ru??d-f To those who voted (
J""* I '
against rm obedience to their11
honest cofvietions, I desire to say j <
that I be|? no ill will?it is your |1
birthrigbl t? v?te f?r whomsoever j1
you please. Those who voted against j5
me for aprice, and those who in- j
fluence&lothers against me by the j1
flagrant use of vile and malicious
reports^I leave to a Higher Judg- ]
ment. They are very sure to re- ]
ceive a just reward.
While I lacked a few votes of re-1
ceivintf the nomination, I do not
fee!, js the least degree, a personal
defeat Everyone who had a part j
in those elections knows that my op-1
position directed its right against j
another and not against me. My
reputation as a man and as a public j
officer has not been hurt, and on the |
other hand, it has been made better
and stronger, for it has held its own
in roricrVi hanrta that wnnld have
smirched it if they could. People!
are,coming to me daily and othersj
are writing, offering congratulations
for the manly campaign which
I made in trying to elevate our local
politics, and deploring the triumph
?>f?i?fairness.
t entered the campaign a clean,
honest man, and I come out of it
now just as clean, and with no tint,
of suspicion. I have no regrets to
JfcSjlfeErister ofh^thanthe regret over!!
the keen disappointment of my many
personal friends, who feel the loss of
a capable, serviceable man in a place
of high trust. Their sincere ex- ,
A MnMlf

the unpleasant things that happened
during the campaign. To these
men, generous and true, let me say:
Await a time with patience, for time
is a great leveller. A cause founded
upon truth and righteousness cannot
fail, neither can a political machine
live which is founded upon grossly
exaggerated demerits of outside parties
and directed from under cover. .
It is a well known fact that I was J
made the burden-bearer of what j
was alleged to be so undesirable in (
others (not one, but many) and for (
T moo in nr> wav rpsnonsihlp.
VV I1IUW X WCU3 <" f |
Yet the guns were turned upon me ,
and the pitiable score is marked by
seventy-one votes! It reminds me <
of the old, old story of the man j
gaining the whole world only to lose t
his own soul. I am frank to say ,
I
^ that no man with justice in his ^
heart can direct or be a party to 1
such a game. No man who pos- t
sesses the proper sense of fairness ,
among men can vote for such prin- ,
ciples and retain a clear conscience.
t I was in the race and made the t
whole campaign on my own merit. |<
Why didn't the opposition fight me? ; g
Why should the voters be prejudiced |
against a man who had done no sin ;
against tne public? If the answer j
to these questions never comes to 11
you, you can sum it up like unto ; f
this: Wrhen the first primary showed 11
me a leader by nearly six hundred ;<
over my nearest opponent, they saw j (
that merit was going to win and }
that thev were short in the winning ^
virtue. Then it was that this re- ^
mark (the author of which I haven't t
been able to learn) came to be heard ,
from out a conference of conspiracy: ]
(and there are always traitors in
your conspirac"'es> my neighbor!) r
"Shealy must be beat if it shakes r
V>AS> \Tar\ and hell! We can do it with \
a few thousand!" And it was done
by a margin ?f seventy-one. I do i
not attribute this to any one man, ?
but I lay it on the heads of the op-j'
ponentsWho fought n?e indirectly j ~
-and with such vile weapons. 0, that j <
\
:he public could open certain locked
ioors and understand the meaning
of certain broad smiles of those who
smerge from places of secrecy! But
the people cannot be fooled all the
time, and the old expression:
"Truth, crushed to earth, will rise
igain," still lives, and honest, valiant
men will see to it that it never
iies!
The seeming success of my successor
will pass like a phantom, for
it was not won on merit but on the
overestimated, magnified ana dis- .
torted demerits ox another heaped
upon my head. Tne public will wait j
J l? 1 _ 3 _ ?
inu waurn?ana bee.
At the -expiration of my short
term, I shall retire to a private life
out the fight has just begun. God j
'
being my helper and guide, I shallj
not stop until the begetters of such j
unfairness are put under my feet;
where will be made to beg for!
mercy and recognition.
After the beginning of the New j
Fear, the principal affairs of Lex- j
ington county will pass to the direction
of a Dual Monarchy, about!
i
which there will be more to say. j
The public doesn't know, but this;
monarchy was at work in the recent j
campaign?directing plans and rnov-;
ments and supplying brains and!
money. These high moguls are j
o-nnH indfres of men: thev well know j
Ov v>~ %/ ??O ' V
who can be handled as tools and
who cannot; so they passed this
word down the line: "Shealy must
be defeated." But Shealy is not
defeated. They only wrested from
me a public office?my sword which
is drawn in defense of truth, honesty,
righteousness, and fairplay, is bright
and gleaming. The day is not far
distant when its edge wiil be felt
by those who can least afford to let
> '
it play on them.
My friends?and the general public?will
soon miss my service, but
there is hope in the future; and
with the great Guiding Force around '
me. I shall labor to make rough
places smooth; crooked places
straight; and dark places light.

If South Carolina?if the entire ,
country for that matter?had more
judges on the bench of the makeip
and calibre of Hon. Mendel
Li. Smith, of Camden, who, by 1
ihance. is presiding over the pres- ,
?nt term of general sessions court, j
:here would be mighty few dockets ^
md but little, if any, crime com
nited within our borders. Judge j
Smith is not only Dossessed of ,
- V
prains, but he is a man with a soul ^
;hrough which permeates and ac- j
mates fairness, truth, honesty and j
rirtue. In him is found the ideal
nan. His whole soul is bent on
;ruth and virtue, and every utterince
carries with it the earmarks of
i great and mighty man. Certain i
punishment for wrongdoing rather 1
;han severe punishment, is Judge *
Smith's idea for checking crime; \ \
. I ,
ind there can be no doubt about it, j (
f you let a man know that certain I (
mnishment is his reward if he vio- (
; |
ates the law, he will think before j
reacts. Judgs Smith's brief adIress
to the grand jury was a mas;erpiece
of eloquence, free from the
'grana stand play," and his con- j
options of the ideal juror, made a t
)rofound impression upon every }
'isitor in the court noom. Lexing- c
;on has but one regiet?the regret \
;hat Judge Smith cannot be with us c
ilways to preside over our coutts.
however his short stay among us
vill leave an impress upon the
ninds and hearts of us all that shall

t Lexington County Fair
The Lexington County Fair premium
lists are now ready for distribution,
and the secretary, Col. M.
D. Harman, together with his office
force, is busily engaged in sending
out the lists and making ready for
the big meet. The fair will be held
this year on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday, October 17, 18 and
19.
Never before in the history of j
the association have the prospects j
been so bright for a large and suc-? j
cessful exhibition. While the crops!
have not been good in point of
yield, the farmers of every section j
are in position to make a splendid !
showing in the agricultural depart-j
ment. The Lexington fair, the oldest
county fair in the State, is I
purely an agricultural fair, organ- j
ized and operated for the be: e it of j
the farming class exclusively. In;
this it has not fallen short of the pur- j
pose for which it was formed; for, j
since the fair has been in operation, j
greater rivalry has existed between j
the farmers each year, and now the
best that the soil will produce is j
shown each year at the Lexington
fair.
While the fair is purely agricultural,
there are other departments?
departments all of which go to
make up a creditable show. The
wonderful natural resources of the
county are best shown at the fair;
and, two, what has been accom-:
plished in industrial, pursuits and in
every other avocation are brought
together.
In nothing has Lexington mad* j
greater progress in the past few
years that! in the growing of fancy
stock of all kinds, and the indications
are that the fm?93t bunch of
home-raised stock will be Shown
this year that has ever been seen In
this section. Since the inauguration
oi the movement by the
federal and State departments of
agriculture for the eradication of
the cattle tick, farmers have given
particular attention to the cattlecrowinc
industrv: and now Lexincr
ton farmers have as fine cattle as
any farmers in any community in
South Carolina. This means that
the cattle department, within itself,
will be a big show and full of interest
to lovers of the fancy.
The management will have a
splendid line of attractions?better
than in recent years ? and there
will be amusements galore for all.
Everybody in Lexington will put
;heir best efforts to make October
L7, 18, and 19, the biggest and
:>est days in the history of the
rounty, and invitation will be expended
to all former Lexingtoniars
:o make the coming fair home-comng

Dear Doctor:
I am pleased to write you this letter,
which you may have pubilshed
as a testimony if you wish.
I suffered with a painful and annoying
case of piles and you cured
me in a few treatments, without the
use of the knife or any detention
from business on my part, and without
pain to any appreciable extent.
I feel that I can recommend you in
the strongest of terms to any one
who suffers from piles.

Many new patients come through
the recommendation of former
patients.
I wish to call your special attention
to the fact that a great many
of my new patients come through
the recommendations of my former
patients or those who are under
treatment. This feature is well
worth the careful consideration of
any one who is afflicted and in need
of treatmrnt.
My success is largely due to my
methods of treatment and my great
experience obtained from the examination
and treatment of hundreds
of cases of rectal diseases, in !
many years of prictice in this

Court Conveued Monday With Judge
Mendel Smith Presiding
The fall term of the court of
general session convened on Monday
morning with Judge Mendel L.
Smith, of Camden, presiding Judge.
Spain was to have held this term
under the regular order of Judges,
but on account of, being ill, Judge
Smith was sent in his stead. Clerk
Shealy, with his accustomed promptness,
had every thing in readiness,
and by the time Judge Smith arrived
a few moments after 10
o'clock, Clerk Shealy had both
grand, petit juries ready for action.
Solicitor Timmerrnan was quick to
hand a number of bills to the court,
and not a single hitch occurred.
Judge Smith briefly charged the
grand jury, taking it for granted
that the grand jury had been tully
charged at previous terms during
the year. Judge Smith's theme
was law enforcement, declaring
that the grand and petit jurors of
the country had more to do with
the enforcement of law than any
other agencies. He was a masterpiece
of eloquence, couched in language
chaste, and never before has
such an imnression been made uoon
| a Lexington audience. A pin could
! have been heard to fall in any part
I of the building during Judge v ,
| Smith's remarks. ?
j The first case called was that of
U. ft. B. Jefcoat and Henrietta
Wiiliamson, white, for living in ?
adultery, The jury returned a
verdict of guilty as to both. Mr.
Jefcoat, sentenced to serve a
period of one year of hard labor,
the sentence being suspended upuif
the payment of $150.00 or upon six
months service. The woman was
sentenced to serve a period of one
year; upon the payment of $100.00
or three months service, the first to
suspended, during the good behaior
of each.
Walter Watson, a 10-year-old *
negro boy, entered a plea of guilty

Mr. J. C. Kinard, of Leesville, and
received a sentence of eight
months in the reformatory.
Heck Patterson and Mose Smith,
two negroes from Swansea, were
tried on a charge of selling liquor.
Patterson was acquitted but Smith
was convicted, and was sentenced
to serve 12 months at hard labor;
nine months to be suspended during
good behavior.
The grand jury will finish its
work today for the year and will
make its final presentement to the
court.
The George Rish murder trial
and the several cases against W. P.
Roof are set for a hearing this
morning.
