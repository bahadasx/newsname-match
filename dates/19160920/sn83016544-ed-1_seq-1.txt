THE LUCKY NUMBER!
Seven states will vote upon pi*o
hibition November 7th. They are
California, Montana, Michigan, Ne­
braska, South Dakota, Idaho, Miss­
ouri. The last named recently se­
cured a dry amendment on the state
ticket through the initiative. The
territory of Alaska wil also vote wet
or dry. In Maryland, the city of Bal­
timore, and other wet city and
county units will vote separately up­
on the question.
It is rather perplexing to some
of our readers to find Idaho listed
as one of the nineteen states aleady
dry and also as one of the seven
states to vote in November. This
is the explanation: Idaho is now un­
der statutory prohibition. At the
coming general election she wil vote
on a constitutional prohibition a
mendment.

GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN SEPTEMBER 20, 1916.
LICENSE REQUIRED
FOR EVERY HUNTER.
Many Misunderstand This Provision
of State Law—Season Opens
October 1st.
The open season for game birds
begins October 1st, and several par­
ties are making preparatinos to
leave for their favorite hunting
grounds in order to be on hand ear­
ly when the* shooting begins.
There is one provision of the State
law regarding which there is con­
siderable confusion and that is with
regard to the license. The law re­
quires every hunter in the state to
have a license. The price of this li­
cense is one dollar and it can be ob­
tained from the county auditor or
any of the many deputies about the
county authorized to issue them.
The only exception is in the case of
farmers and settlers who are per­
mitted to shoot small game on their
own property without a license.
The federal and state laws regard­
ing shooting of small game are prac­
tically idential, the one important
exeption benig the federal law which
limits the shooting during the open
season to the hours between sunrise
and sunset.
WILL WE HAVE A
COMMERCIAL CLUB?
There never was a time in the his­
tory of the Village of Grand Marais
when a Commercial Club could be of
more advantage to this community
than at the present time. A num­
ber of those interested in the future
of the Village have mentioned the
subject and from comments on the
matter heard wherever the subject
was discussed, it would only be ne­
cessary for a self-appointed commit­
tee to take the matter in hand and
make the arrangements for a meet­
ing.
There will be those who will say,
"well it will only die out again in a
short time so what's the use," and*
will refuse to have anything to do
with it. The club will be better off
to have those of that opinion out­
side of its membership. A commer­
cial club in a small community at
the best is a spasmodic quantity. It
only exerts its influence at the times
that seem critical in the history of
the community.
COOK COUNTY FAIR, THURSDAY, FRIDAY and SITURDAY. SEPTEMBER 28th, 29th and 30th
Lets get together and in a good
patriotic manner discuss ways and
means of boosting for a Greater
Grand Marais and a Greater Cook
Countv.
EXPLORATION WORK
TO BEGIN NEXT YEAR
Mr. John G. Howard who visited
in the Village this morning is au­
thority for the statement that as
soon as the Gunflint road, which is
now being surveyed by County Sur­
veyor Berglund and a crew of men,
is completed, alarge amount of dril­
ling and prospecting will be done in
the northern part of the county, by
himself and associates. A number
of diamond drills will be brought
in and a large number of men en­
gaged. The town of Maple Hill has
undertaken the work of improving
this road, which, when open, will
prove the key to the opening of the
iron ore deposits which have so long
awaited marketing, and which will do
more toward proving or disproving
the statement of geologists that
Cook County is destined to be one
of the richest counties in the
State.
SHORTAGE IN PRINT PAPER
FELT BY ALL NEWSPAPERS
On acount of the scarcity and
high price of print paper, all the pa
pers in the country are using an in­
ferior grade and also cutting down
the size of the papers.
The St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer
Press Printing Companies have pur­
chased the paper and pulp mill lo­
cated at Grand Rapids and have
thus insured themselves a supply of
print paper of which they use about
7,500 tons annually. The price of
white paper has advanced from $38.
per ton to $120.00, and mills are now
refusing to make contracts as they
have in the past, making the supply
uncertain. Newspapers all over the
country have been attempting to
meet this increase by the condensing
of news and reducing the size of
the paper. Some papers have been
forced to discontinue and unless
conditions change the shortage will
be felt even more keenly.
WAR TAX STAMPS HAVE
S BEEN ABOLISHED
Tax Withdrawn on Most Articles.
New Law Went Into Effect
Last Saturday.
Beginning Saturday the stamp
taxes, which have been making holes
in a large number of pocketbooks,
will Jhave been abolished.
The abolition of the war tax, as
it is generally known, comes about
thro .,jrh changes made in framing
the new emergency revenue bill,
which became effective Saturday
and while the scope of the stamp
tax was very wide and covered al­
most everything in the way of lux
eries, and many necessities the new
law makes important changes. The
tax is not removed from liquor, but
has been modified considerably, it is
understood but hte tax has ben eli
understood and it is believed that
tobacco still has to produce addi­
tional revenue for the government
but the tax has been eliminated
from almost everything which ef­
fects everyday life of the average
citizen.
A* important fact in connection
with the new stamp tax pi'ovisions
is that those having on hand unused
tax stamps and have no further use
for them under the new law, may
redeem them at any time during the
next two years.
It is uncertain, so far as know­
ledge here is concerned, what com­
modities are still taxed, but word
was" received which makes certain
schedules A and of the old law
have been eliminated. These con­
tain provisions covering the most
important items to the average citi­
zen.
The old stamp tax law was passed
by Congress in October, 1914, and
became a law December 1, that year.
It was provided that it would hold
for one year with the option of re
enactment. In view of the fact
th^i* i&stricted conditions had not
been afleviated the end of a year,
the law was re-enacted last year.
The items released from the
stamp tax by the provisions of the
new law are as follows:
Bonds, debentures or certificates
of indebtedness issued by any as­
sociation, 5 cents on each $100 of
face value or fraction thereof.
Certificates of stock on organiza­
tion or reorginization, to the same
amount transfers of stock, 2 cents
on each $100 of face value or frac­
tion thereof.
Sales, agreement of sale or agree­
ments to sell any product or mer­
chandise at any exchange, boai*d of
trade or similar place, either for
present or future delivery, 1 cent
for each $100 or fraction thereof
involved.
Promissory notes, except bank
notes for circulation, and for each
renewal, 2 cents per $100 or fraction
Express and freight bills of lad­
ing, 1 cent.
Indemnifying bonds, and all other
similar bonds, 50 cents.
Certificates of profit, etc., 2 cents.
Certificates of damage or other­
wise, and all certificates used by any
port warden, marine surveyor or
other person acting as such, 25 cents
All certificates required by law,
10 cents.
Contracts, broker's note or memo
andurn of sale, 10 cents.
Deeds, etc., 50 cents for each
$500 of value.
Entry of any goods in custom
house or for withdrawal of such
goods.
Insurance of all kinds.
Passengers tickets for passage to
a foreign port costing more than
$10.
Power of attorney or proxy for
voting power of attorney to sell
real estate or rent or lease.
Protests of notes, bills of ex­
change, acceptance, check or draft.
Every seat sold in a palace or par­
lor car and every birth in a sleeping
car.
Perfumery and cosmetics, chewing
gum.
Oscar Olson made an auto trip to
Duluth leaving here on Thursday
morning with Mrs. Sjoberg and Miss
Karen Johnson as passengers. Mr.
Olson made a short trip to Milaca
and vicinity looking up hay and
feed for his barn for the winter,
and reports that the oats crop is poor
on account of the rust. He pur­
chased several cars of hay which
will be shipped within the next few
weeks. Mr. Olson returned to this
village on Sunday night.

FiRE DESTROYS CAMP
AT CASCADE BRIDGE
The cook camp at Cascade bridge
was discovered to be on fire about
7:30 on Monday morning. The crew
was working on the bridge when the
blaze was noticed on the roof of the
building which was a frame struc­
ture. The flames made rapid head­
way and only a few things were
saved. Mr. Wahlstrom lost a large
number of mechanic's,-tools together
with some wearing apparel for him­
self and family. Mrs. Wahlstrom
and the little girl were in the house
at the time but were unaware of
the fii'e until the alarm was given
by the men working on the bridge.
Tents have now been erected and
will be used until the completion of
the bridge which will be about four
weeks.
