Sending the boy baek-to grownup in
Japan and learn Japanese ways and
customs. Wade Warren Thayer re
fused today to grant a birth certificate
from the office of secretary- of the
territory. .
Thayer says that if the case comes
to a lawsuit in the efforts of the par"
ents to secure the certificate for their
child that he is willing to see the mat
ter threshed out in the courts. He
believes that the stand he has taken
in the matter is right, and if little
Shizo sails toward Japan this after
noon on the Persia Maru with bis
mother as Intended, the family will
hold no papers stating that the little
fellow was born in Hawaii. .
Shizo's father Is Kamado Kiyuna, a
laborer on one of the island planta
tions. He brought the boy this morn
in to the secretary's office with wit
nesses to show that the lad is a . na
tive of the territory. The father stat
ed that he was sending. his wife and
two children to Japan on- the Persia
to see the children's grandfather. Sec
retary; Thayer, inquired how long the
visit from the little son was to last
"The grandfather' Is anxious to see
these children," responded the elder
Kiyuna, "and Shizo shall stay, for 15
years. I, too, would ratner- nave him
stay in Japan until he is quite old."
Kiyuna spoke through an interpre
ter, explaining further that he wishes,
his son's boyhood training to be in the
and of the chrysanthemum.
'Here is a case where the father
comes right out. and says he wants
his son educated in Japan though
born - in America," says Secretary
Thayer, "and my observations are
that he will be a pretty poor American

Ten times greater than for last
year, - the federal appropriation, to the
National Guard ot-awalI, etailsof
which were recelve'dtoday at- head
quarters of the organization, will
amount to $329,552.23 for 1916-17)
Word that this amount was forth
coming from: the federal government
was received about a week' ago by the
Star-Bulletin In' an Associated Press
despatch, though no ' details of the
appropriation were -given.
Hawaii's share, which amount is to
be used only for equipment and Geld
training work along, the lines of all
federal appropriations to the guard,
is second alone to New York state,
this territory being No. 2 on the list
in order of amounts given;
The fact that no guardsmen from
the territory participated in the move
ments along the border is responsible
for the large amount this year, the
recommendation of the secretary - of
war' being that the ': apportionment
should be made on tthe basis 'of
guardsmen left uncalled in the dif
ferent states and territories. New
York's totaj is $499,184.68.
Two appropriations are included In
the totaL, amount for the territory;
$167,654.77 for arming, equipping and
training.the national gaard and $161,

and such for field service. It was
pointed out. .tpdaythat so much more
