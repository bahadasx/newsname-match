After going over the conditions in
Indiana, Senator Tom Taggart adherea
to his original prediction that the State
will go DO, 000 Democratic, and your
Uncle Thomas generally knows where
of he affirms.
The Woman's Club meets promptly
at 2:30. Prompt attendance is earnest
ly requeated. The members are aln
requested to anawer to their nxme at

Are you willing that the gratifying
conditions of 'peace, prosperity and
plenty be changed to the almost cer
tainty of war and its fearful conaequen
ces, In the event of Mr. Ilughea'
election? If you are not, a ' vote for
Wilson will help to keep him on guard
to maintain the honor of the country
and to ace that American livei are pro
tected on land and sea.
Mr. Hughes gave up a $12,500 office
to lead the forlorn hope of a discredited
party. He has no doubt realized dur
ing his disappointing campaign, that he
made a foolish mistake in giving up a
bird in the hand for one in the bush,
with the cold winter coming on, too.
New York papers will probably in a
fw days have in their want columna an
appeal for work for a statesman out of
a job.
The order has gone forth to the He
publican leaders in the 11th district to
hold up the announcement of the vote
until it Is known how many votes are
needed to carry the State. This is an
old game up there and has been success
fully workml more than once. Hut it
won't be this tin.e. Federal Detectives
will be on hand, and any attempt to
juggle the returns, will be sure to land
the vote stealers in jail.
In his every public act. Candidate
Hughes nas shown hie antipathy to the
man who earns his living by the sweat
of his brow, and his love for the man
with a bank roll. Wall Street and the
Interests are backing him for all they
are worth, and if elected, he will pay
them back with interest. Vote for
V ilaon and help to prevent the con'
sumation of such a deal.
It is almost as important to have a
Democratic Congress as a Democratic
President, as the Kxecutive could do
but little unless supported by a Con
gress in sympathy wjth him The gen
tlemen nominated for Congress in this
State have demonstrated their al
legiance to President Wilson and helped
him put over his program of construct
ive and progressive legislation. Every
one of them deserves re election, and it
is the duty, as it should be the pleasure
of every Democrat to roll up big ma
jorities for them. Their names will
appear on the ballot, below those of
the electors for Wilson and Marshall,
and a simple stamp in theiquare ai the
foot of the Itooster will insure your v ote
for them.
SPEAKING AT PAINT LICK.
To-morrow afternoon, Hon, John W.
Newman, of Versailles, will address
the people of Paint I.ick and community
in the interest of the Democratic party.
Mr. Newmun is a splendid speaker and
a gooc' crowd should greet him. The
speaking will begin at 1:30. Friday
evening Mr. Newman will speak at
llerea
A LANDSLIDE PROBABLE
The Wilson sentiment crows snacc as
the duys go by and his splendid achieve
menta aie becoming better understood
and those in position to know the sit
uation are! liredictim? a veritable land
slide. The President himself is
thoroughly convinced that he will he rc
eltcted as he does not believe that the
voters will permit Hepublicans to ob
tain power and "make a mess of it."
He is riirht. The neonle have already
made up their minds to have four more
fat and peaceful years with Wilson.
Hughes Is out of the question.
FINE STATEMENT.
The advertisement showing the splen
did financial condition of the Peoples
Hank, at Paint I.ick appears In this
issuo of the Itecord and Is well worth
anyone's perusal. With a capital and
surplus of $30,000 and over, it shows a
deposit of $107,332.83 as .of October
80th. Mr. Woods, the genial cashier,
believes in a liberal amount of printers
Ink and when he has a good thing,
wants his friends and customers to
know It. Hedosen't hesitate to tell
you that he attributes the wonderful
prosperity of this bank and the general
prosperous condition of the community,
to Woodrow Wilson and the Democratic
administration.
FINDING IT OUT
SILVER TEA.
The annual Tea at the Presbyterian
church which is always looked forward
to with pleasure by not only members
of that denomination but others who
always attend, was well patronized.
The church was beautifully decorsted
in ferns and potted plants. Hallowe'en
decorations were also in evidence. A
delicious lunch was served, consisting
of chicken salad, beaten biscuit, sand
wiches, colfee and chocolate. .
A neat sum was realized which is
always In the form of a free will offer
ing and is used for missionary purposes.
ROUSING RALLY
There was a rousing rally at Herring
school house last Tuesday night, when
an array of local talent swooped down
on the democracy of the "cat-hole'
and gave the boys a dose of Democratic
doctrine that they will remember for
several years to come. The speakers
were O. C. Walker, J. E. Robinson,
J. It. Mount and R. 11, Tomlinson. The
campaign committee is very grateful
for the use of the house and if the
young teacher could have heard the
many compliments paid her on the
neatness and the patriotism of this
model school building, we don't think
she will grieve much over the bench
that was broken, by a Democratic
heavyweight, that was the speaker of
the evening.
ALMOST OVER.
A few more days and the tale will be
told, and that it will be a glorious one
for Democracy seems not to admit of a
dcubt, but in order to make assurance
doubly sure Democrats must not relax
a single effort because of over con
fidence. Let every Democrat insist
that every Democrat go with him to the
polls and for four years more he will
rejoice that he fought the good fight to
keep on guard the msn who while doing
so much of value to the country has
kept it out of war. Stamp under the
rooster and thereby also help to elect
the congressmen who have given the
president auch unwavering support for
without a majority of whom he would
be unable to accomplish the great
thinga he has done and has on his pro
gram to do.
DR. GANFIELD DELIGHTS.
"What Makes A Town Worth Living
In" was beautifnlly expressed In a
talk bv Dr. W. A. Ganfield, president
of Center College, at the court heuse
last Friday evening, under the auspices
of the civic department of the Wom
en's Club of this city, the house being
crowded with one of the best represent
ed audiences ever gathered in the hall.
Mr. J. E. Robinson introduced the
speaker and highly eulogized this de
partment of the Women's Club for the
many achievements it had accomplish
ed, the truits of which can be seen in
our beautiful little park, of which we
are all so proud. Dr. Ganfield has
made friends by the hundred and who
will always accord him a hearty wel
come and a glad hand.
W. C. T. U. RECEPTION.
On Tuesday afternoon at the home of
the President, Mrs. Kinnaird, a very
pleasant Informal reception was given
by the W. C. T. U. The unions from
Ilryantsville, Paint Lick and Hubble
were invited, and the presence of these
visiting ladies was much enjoyed. From
Paint Lick came Mrs. Smith and Mrs.
Hammack. Ilryantsville sent Miss
Eliza Ison, Mesdames Dr. Rose, Cun
ningham, Kennedy, Williams and Uur
gess. There was also present many new
members as well as the old regulars
who have been so faithful to the Tem
perance cause these many years. May
their lojalty be rewarsed, and Boon
may the great liquor traffic be banished
from our land, and the Hag float over
the homes free from its awful curse.
UNIQUE ENTERTAINMENT.
Mrs. Guy Davidson entertained at a
most unique Hallowe'en entertainment
in honor of the "Circle Girls" Tuesday
afternoon. The house was artistically
decorated in Jack o'lanterns and bright
autumn leaves.
The rooms were darkened and vuu
were met at the door by a "Spook"
robed in white, it led you to another
door where a larger and "Spookier
SKok conducted you to a small bower
where a "Fortune Teller" told fortunes,
revealing "pasts and presents" in a
way that made all marvel at her
power. Her revelations we're often so
'appropo" you felt she must be a witch
indeed, llright red apples strung across
the doors and a large pan of water with
apples floating on top afforded a lot of
amusement as different ones tried to
bite them without touching them.
The guessing game was the feature
of the evening. On a table were cards
in the form of small pumpkins, on open
ing them you found a picture and des
cription, written in rhyme, of each cir
cle girl. Quite a number guessed them
all correctly, but Mrs. Cahel Denny
drew the lucky "shortest" straw which
entitled her to a beautiful little hand
kerchief. Mrs. Ross liastln drew the
"booby" prize, which was a little pin
urhion in the form of a pumpkin.
A very delightful afternoon soon
passed and all left with reluctance, but
loud in their praise of the charming
hostess and the original entertainment.
TO HIS SORROW.
Mr. Hughes Is finding out what a
tangled web we weave when first we
practice to deceive, and will pay the
penalty on election day. He will not be
allowed to serve Americans and the
Germans will soon feel disgust for a
man who was so anxious for office ss
to be willing to tell his birthright for it.
RECEPTION AT
CHRISTIAN CHURCH.
The ladies of the Christian church
almost to member, are preparing for
a reception tn be given at the Christian
church next Friday evening, November
the third, in honor of the new members
that were added to the church during

should bring out the entire membership
lor this delightful entertainment and
reception and it is asked and urged thnt
every member attend. Refreshments
will be served and it is planned to have
a visiting minister to make a short
talk and altogether the evening will be
profitably and pleasantly spent. Re
member the time, tomorrow (Friday)
evening, at Christian church.
BEAUTIFUL WED
DING DINNER.
Mr. and Mrs. George Robinson en
tertained at an elegant course dinner
in honor of the bride elect. Miss Nancy
Walker, last Friday evening. Only the
bridal party were seated at the festive
board. The color scheme was pink,
which was carried out both in deco
rations and the menu. In the center
of table was a large French basket
filled with pink roses, the individual
ices were also pink roses while the
cakes were Iced with the same flower.
Tiny pink baskets containing the wed
ding cake were placed as souvenirs at
each plate, the place cards were hand
painted pictures of brides and grooms.
Both the table appointments and menu
were perfect in every detail.
KENTUCKY'S GIFT
TO BEREA COLLEGE
In order to further the education of
women within its borders, the state of
Kentucky, through its citizens, present'
ing a handsome building to the campus
of Berea College. This building is to
accommodate 100 young women who
have come from the southern mountains
for an education at Berea, and in ad'
dition contains dining arrangements for
800 young women, Kentucky Hall, as
the new building is to be known, is one
of the most serviceable of the newer
building at the Berea campus, and its
entire cost, including the dining-rooms
and the model kitchen adjacent, is
$50,000, of which Kentuckians are en
deavoring to raise the full amount.
About half of this sum has now been
collected. This is the first time, bo far
as is known in this section, of citizens
of a state as a whole raising funds for
the education of young people of its
own and neighboring territories.
According to President Frost, of
Berea College, Kentucky Hall will fill a
great need in the education of the worn
en of the southern mountains, and it Is
hoped that this will be the first of sev
eral steps of similar character to fur
ther this department of Berea'a work,
which has already exceeded the capaci
ty of the college.
MISS IDA MAY GRANT
Passes Away Al Early Hour This Morning.
The announcement of the death of
Miss Ida May Grunt, which occurred at
an early hour this morning, came as a
shock to her friends although the im
mediate family have known for several
days that the end was near. The ar
rangement for the funeral had not been
made as we go to press, on account of
the absence of the brother, Dr. II. M.
Grant, who is now in Norfolk, Vs., but
this will probably take place some time
during the day next Saturday, A more
extended notict of the passing awuy
of this beautiful character will appear
in the next issue of the Record.
