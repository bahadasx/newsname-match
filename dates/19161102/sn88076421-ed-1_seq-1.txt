WM. CROWDED
SHOT ALBERT N.
Mill tOSS
Prominent Retired Farmer Fatally
Wounds Old Time Foe Who Is
Expected to Die—Now in Jail
Special to the Independent:
Ross, N. D., Nov. 1.—William Crow
der, a prominent citizen of Ross, shot
and fatally wounded Albert N. Olson,
aged 35 years, a well known farm lab­
orer of this place, at 7 o'clock this eve­
ning. Crowder gave himself up and
was taken to Stanley by Sheriff
Slaughter where he remains in jail,
awaiting the outcome of Olson's in­
juries. At this writing Olson is un­
conscious and doctors say that he can
hardly live during the day. Before be­
coming unconscious, he signed a state­
ment that Crowder shot him without
just provocation. Olson is a married
man and the father of three children.
Crowder is about 60 years of age
and has resided at Ross for nearly 15
years. He filed on a homestead near
this place during the early days and
recently sold his farm, coming to Uoss
to reside, building and renting houses.
He has a wife and five children.
Crowder shot Olson with a .32 c-il.'.
ber revolver, one bullet penetrating
the intestines and the other going thru
the mouth and coming out the side of
the face under one of his ears. The
wound in his head is not necessarily
fatal, the more dangerous one being
that in the abdomen. Doctors are
working hard to save Olson but state
that he has not one chance in a hun­
dred.
No charge has been filed against
Crowder, who is held in the county jail
at Stanley without bail. In case of
Olson's death he will be charged with
murder.
The men were enemies for years it
is said. They were neighbors when
they resided on their farms and had
trouble years ago. Just what led up
to the shooting is not known as Crow­
der refuses to make any statement.
Crowder visited Stanley a week or
two ago and purchased the revolver
which he is said to have used on Ol­
son, stating that he needed it for a
fellow, but failing to mention any
names.
Crowder gained considerable prom­
inence years ago when he started the
action against Major J. S. Murphy^ in
the famous railway road tax receipt,
case. He has been regarded as a man
with an ungovernable temper.

SEVENTY-FIVE COWS BRING
$80,625 AT GREAT SALE
Mr. and Mrs. E. S. Person returned
this week from a month's tour of the
east. They visited Niagara Falls,
spent a week in Boston, made side
trips to some of the fine country es­
tates near that city, visited the old
historic places around Concord and
Springfield, Mass., and visited several
cousins in New Hampshire, Vermont
and Maine, several of whom they had
never before seen.
They spent three days at the Na­
tional Dairy Show at Boston, being
theTe on Guernsey day., attending the
banquet in the evening. The mem­
bers of the National Dairymen's as­
sociation of which Mr. Person is a
member, were taken on a number of
trips to the famous dairy farms in
Massachusetts, where some of the best
individuals in the country are to be
seen. Many of the farms are owned
by millionaires who have built steam
heated barns finer than many homes.
Mr. Person attended a Guernsey sale
at Langwater where 75 Guernseys
were sold for $80,625. One cow sold
for $6,150 and the man who bought
her refused $500 for his bargain. The
record of this cow, which is 670
pounds of butterfat, does not equal
the record of Major Person's champion
cow, Lura Bettina, whose record is
V
.as.
739 pounds. The Major sews dairy
cattle are high in the east. The poor­
est registered cows sell for $300 and
any old grade cow brings $100. He
saw a 3-months-old bull calf that sold
for $1,000.
The Major doesn't think much of the
farming land in the east, a large part
of which consists of ledges of rock.
The farms appear to be mostly worn
out and there are any number of farms
that can be bought for the cost of the
improvements. Dairying and poultry
raising are the chief occupations and
feed is scarce and high. We waste
more in North Dakota than they raise
on their farms, he says.
Boston is a miserable dirty city.
There is no fresh air and the build­
ings look dirty from smoke.
At Valley Forge he saw a house
built in 1722 which is still well pre­
served. They visited in New York,
Philadelphia and Washington, going
out to Arlington cemetery.
FARMERS GROW WEALTHY
RAISING FLAX CROPS
Leslie and Art Benno made a "kill­
ing" growing flax out on the Berthold
reservation this year. They had in
600 acres which averaged 13 bushels.
They sold $18,000 worth of flax, mak­
ing $12,000 clear. They used an Alt
man-Taylor outfit. They broke up the
coal land, getting the crop for the
breaking. They have invested in a
new breaking outfit and will go into
the business heavier than ever next
year. Chas. H. Withers Co. have dis­
posed of eight Altman-Taylor outfits
in the vicinity of Parshall.
D. A. Snyder grew 1700 acres south
of Parshall this year, getting $50,000
worth of flax, making $35,000 clear.
Five hundred acres averaged 15 bush­
els. He made $30,000 last year from
flax. Snyder comes from La Porte,
Ind.
Peterson Bros, made a lot of money
growing flax this year and Dickey
Bros, have sold $25,000 worth of flax.
They have leased two sections of land
near Poplar, Mont. Many others have
grown rich raising flax on the new
land.

NONPARTISAN LEAGUE
Final Instructions Given at Meetings
Held All Over the State Tues­
day Afternoon
THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
The nonpartisan league over the en
ire state held precinct meetings on the
afternoon of Oct. 31. The meetings
were open only to members of the
league and they were not at all secret.
The league merely called the meetings
to give final instructions concerning
the campaign. Cards were issued
showing the list of the league
candidates that have been endorsed for
the various offices. No action was
taken on United States Senator, mem­
ber of congress or judges of the judi­
cial districts and the county ticket
was not considered at all.
The league hopes to get out its com­
plete strength and if this happens
practically all of the candidates en­
dorsed by that organization will be
elected next Tuesday. The state ticket
from Frazier down will be elected by
a big majority.
office and Luce has promised to make
a number of the checks good Saturday
night. The Blair woman says the
checks were given by Ollie Berg for
services rendered. They were issued
on the Scandinavian-American bank of
Grand Forks, but were made out on
Minot checks which had been changed.
The Independent holds one of these
checks for $10 and we'd like our mon­
ey. We'd also like to see the color of
Ollie Berg's hair, if such a party can
be produced.
FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONER
I am a candidate for county com­
missioner from the First Commission­
er's district. I was regularly nomi­
nated on the democratic ticket at the
primaries and if the voters of Minot
are satisfied that I will look after the
business interests of the county in a
capable manner, I will be pleased with
your support. I will give the business
my closest attention if elected, realiz­
ing that this is one of our most im­
portant offices. I was county com­
missioner for ten years and will be
pleased to have anyone refer to my
record.

SECURES LOW POTATO
RATE TO THE COAST
Potato Kaisers of North Dakota Can
Now Ship Three Ways Out of

The Minot Association of Commerce

GOOD SET OF CANDIDATES
Ward county is normally republi­
can by great odds and the republicans
having nominated one of the best tick­
ets Ward county has ever known,
there is little question but what the
entire ticket will be elected. With such
candidates holding the various county
offices as the following, the affairs will
be looked after in an economical, cap­
able manner: John J. Nedreloe, sher­

The only potato rate up to this time
was 92 1-2 cents per 100 pounds—
nearly one cent a pound. As a conse­
quence potatoes have always been
shipped east and south, the growers
taking whatever the dealers there
would give them. For a long time
North Dakota grown potatoes have
been used for seed as far south as
Texas, and as far east as Indiana and
Ohio. But upon a number of occas­
ions the North Dakota growers have
come out at the little end of the horn,
because when they arrived in Kansas
City or Chicago the market was way
off, and they took a loss. In order to
open up another market the Minot As­
sociation of Commerce undertook to

HERE'S PROOF OF PROS­
PERITY OF THE STATE
Bismarck, Oct. 30—Conclusive proof
that North Dakota is enjoying sub­
stantial prosperity is found in the fact
that although notes for $250,000 worth
of twine purchased from the state pen­
itentiary are not due until Nov. 1, only
a few thousand dollars remain unpaid,
the vast majority of buyers, who con­
sist of farmers in every county in
North Dakota, having found it conven­
ient to take their discount.
Specialist in Diseases of the
Stomach Locates in Minot
Dr. J. C. R. Charest, formerly of
Thief River Falls, Wis., has located in
the city, with offices in the Sons of
Norway block next to Dr. Mykelstad's
offices. Dr. Charest is a specialist in
stomach diseases.
The doctor is a graduate of the La­
va medical college at Montreal and he
has been practicing for a good many
years. He comes to Minot with the
best of recommendations.
Nine high school boys were arrested
in Fargo Hallowe'en night for playing
pranks and destroying property. Their
daddies found them in jail in the morn­

secure a lower rate to the Pacific
coast, so that another outlet would be
gained for our growers. This effort
has been crowned with success at last.
During the Panama-Pacific-Interna
tional Exposition at San Francisco,
Larimore, this state, put on a baked
potato day, and right after that event
the market for North Dakota spuds
was ready and waiting, but the freight
rate was prohibitive. Californians
never ate such good potatoes before,
and they wanted them and wanted
them bad, because they tickled the
palate of the most particular potato
epicure.
The Association of Commerce has
maintained all along that 75c per 100
pounds was an ample rate, for the
main shipment of spuds from this
state to the coast would occur when
the fruit shipment was eastward, and
the railway company, instead of send­
ing fruit cars west empty as they
have been doing, would be able to haul
them back loaded with the best pota­
toes that grow. This week the Sec­
retary of the association received the
new tariff, which provides for the rate
of 75c per 100 pounds between points
in Minnesota, South and North Dako­
ta to San Francisco, California. This
tariff provides the following: Pota­
toes, including sweet potatoes, car­
load, minimum weight 30,000. No
charge will be made for stoves and
linings used to protect carload ship­
ments from October 1st to May 1st,
the maximum allowance in weight
therefor to be 1400 pounds. Stoves
and linings so used will be returned
free to original point of shipment.
This new rate goes into effect De­
cember 3rd, and while it may not af­
fect shipments this year, it will have a
great bearing on shipments in the fu­
ture.
The Association of Commerce sug­
gests that in making shipments to San
Francisco or intermediate points, that
the potatoes be graded as io weight
and color, wrapped and packed in reg­
ular apple boxes. In this way the
top price for the potatoes can be se­
cured, for people nowadays like their
eatables put up in neat condition.
The Association of Commerce does
rot consider its work done in the mat­
ter of this new potato rate, and the
organization stands ready at all times
to co-operate with all growers in this
part of the state who desire to ship
west instead of the low market in the
east and south, which fluctuates so
much.
Potatoes in Ohio at the present time
are selling for $2.50 per bushel. Good
potatoes on the coast will bring that
much or more, antMf packed in the
right manner there is no limit to the
price that can be secured for fancy
stock. Baked potatoes in San Fran­
cisco sell at from 20c apiece upwards,
so it can be seen that the market will
be a good one.
FOUR YOUNG MEN IN
Overland Turned Turtle Injuring Al­
bert Dahlheim Painfully—Driver
Going at Reckless Speed.
Albert Dahlheim, a young man of
this city, was severely injured in an
auto accident which occurred in front
of the John Ehr residence on Valley
street at 4 o'clock Monday morning
and three other occupants of the car,
John Snow, Edward Stum and Earl
Coates, were more or less injured. The
car, a brand new Overland, owned by
Ole Johnson, a Granville merchant,
was wrecked so badly that it is al­
most worthless. The wheels were
smashed and the machine wrecked
generally.
Dahlheim suffered a severe cut on
the leg, causing the loss of consider­
able blood, but he is recovering nice­
ly. It appears that Dahlheim, who
was driving the car at a fearful speed,
lost control of it and ran it up onto
the sidewalk in front of the Ehr home.
As the machine swerved back into the
street, it overturned. One of the
young men awoke J. C. Smallwood and
telephoned for a doctor.
The street presented a gory sight
where Dahlheim lay. The car turned
completely around after it overturned.

Refused to be Ejected From Printing
Office
D. R. Craig of Fargo, representative
of the Western Newspaper Union,
smashed J. C. Hoff, old-time newspa­

morning after Hoff had taken hold of
him trying to eject him from "nis office.
Hoff is now engaged in publishing a
Scandinavian paper in this city and
Craig had called on him to collect a
$15 bill for plate furnished while Hoff
was publishing papers at Palermo and
Lignite. Hoff repudiated the debt.
One of his printers stepped in and
saved the editor from more serious
consequences.

FIRST
SECTION
NORTH DAKOTA
Temporary Organization Was Effected
in Minot—Will Hold Show in Con­
nection With Midwinter Fair
A number of gentlemen interested
in the poultry business met at the of­
fice of the Association of Commerce
this week and perfected a temporary
organization of the Northwestern
North Dakota Poultry association, for
the purpose of holding annual poultry
shows at Minot, in conjunction with
the Midwinter Fair.
The organization was perfected by
electing the following officers, who will
direct the affairs of the association
until the first show:
President—John Stoudt, Minot.
Vice President—Geo. W. Walton,
Velva.
Treasurer—W. A. Peck, Minot.
Secretary—Will E. Holbein. Minot.
Directors—John Stoudt, Minot W.
M. Wigham, Minot W. W. Davenport,
Velva A. B. Benoit, East Fairview
J. A. Southam, Mohall E. A. Madson,
Burlington W. F. Sommerdorf, Town­
er, and F. E. Ward, Minot.
In all likelihood several more direct­
ors will be added within the next few
days, so as to interest all portions of
the northwestern portion of the state
in the association.
The membership fee was placed at
$1.00 per year, and all those who de­
sire to become affiliated with the as­
sociation can do so by sending their re­
mittance to the secretary in care of
the Association of Commerce, Minot,
N. D., and in turn he will issue the
usual membership card.
The poultry industry in the north­
western part of the state is growing
by leaps and bounds, and in order to
assist prospective poultry raisers in
securing the breeds best adapted for
their needs poultry shows are becom­
ing an absolute necessity. At these
shows the man or woman who wants to
engage in the business can see for
themselves just what breed they think
best for them to raise, and the shows
also give them an opportunity to buy
the best on the market.
There is a great deal of enthusiasm
all over the state at the present time
over the poultry industry, and this
part of the state cannot afford to lie
dormant on this important matter.
Ward county last year had over $25,
000 worth of poultry. It would be easy
to quadruple this investment in one
year. The poultry association will help
wonderfully in this regard.
WHEAT TRANSPORTED
WITH AUTOMOBILES
Bismarck, Oct. 31.—With two-dollar
wheat comes taxicab transportation.
This luxurious mode of travel for 70
bushels of grain which Matt Clooten
claimed as his has resulted in two taxi
drivers and a restaurant man being
placed under $300 bonds to answer to
charges of grand larceny.
The normal rate for taxis in Bis­
marck is $3 the hour. The two taxis
u?ed in this instance each made three
trips to the Clooten farm, 10 miles
from Bismarck, bringing in ten sacks
at a trip.
The defendants, Wolford Gronx and
Roy Chamberlain, drivers for the Har­
ry Clooten livery, and a young man
named Tardy claimed, when arraigned
before Police Magistrate Dolan, that
they acted for a fourth party, who hir­
ed them at regular rates to bring in
the wheat, a la taxi, and who sold the
grain to a local elevator. The same
man, they alleged, broke the lock on
the Clooten granary.
BABY FALLS ON STOVE
Wyndmere, Oct. 31.—Wriggling out
of her mother's arms and falling on a
hot stove, the five-months-old child of
Mr. and Mrs. Math Reiland of this
place was seriously burned. The moth­
er had just completed the baby's bath
and was about to dry the youngster
when she gave a sudden lunge, slip­
ping from the mother's arms onto the
top of the stove. The baby will live,
although she will be disfigured for life.
Negro is Recovering.
•"Goldie" Brown, colored, true name
Ed Golden, who was shot during the
disgraceful row in the Harris joint
last week, will recover. One bullet
which plowed a hole seventeen inches
long from the hip, lodging in the knee,
has been removed, altho the bullet in
the man's neak has not been removed.
Brown will face a serious charge in
connection with the death of Frank
Gregg.
SEVENTH SEEKS DIVORCE
Grand Forks, Oct. 31.—Claiming she
accepted him as her seventh husband
when he believed that he was the first,
William B. Williams, residing near Ar
villa, asks for an absolute decree of di­
vorce from Gertie May Williams in
district court before Judge C. M. Cool
ey, charging cruel and inhuman treat­
ment and desertion.
Mrs. Peter McKone, Sr., arrived
from Westby, Mont., this morning and
will spend a few weeks with relatives
in the city. She was accompanied
by her grandson, Master Claire Mc­
Kone, who will resume his studies in
the Minot schools.
