dorsed it. Not an indictment was

W. II: HUGHES, Judge.
Columbia, Miss.
The prohibition laws are by far
the best and most effective ever
enacted in the State. Since ono
quart law became operative, crime
in my district has been minimized
and I have repeatedly announced
to the public from the bench that
aside from the moral improvement
the law would practically save in
Court expenses the amount of the
lawmakers' salaries before tha
next session.

The grand jury for Oktibbeha

liquors, but in this county at this
term we ftn& no crimes traeaaM
to lirars, and as a resnh wa have
found for all eTimes only ten Mils,
the smallest lumber for this Court
in 25 years. We think the flew
liquor law prohibiting shipment
of more than one quart is chiefly
responsible for the absenee of
crime. We think the law has
eliminated the blind . tiger. We
hope the one quart law will be sus
tained by the people because of
its fine effect in suppressing crime
and lessening Court expenses,"
As judge, I heartily endorse the
above as applied to my entire dis
trict. THOS. B. CARROLL,
Judge.
Carroflton, Miss.
It is my opinion that the Weak
ley liquor law is the best prohibi
tion law that has ever been put
upon the statute books of Missis
sippi. The indictments for intox
icating liquors have decreased f)0
per cent in my district, the Fifth
Judicial district, and I understand
from the public generally that
there is less drunkenness than ever
before in the seven counties that
compose this Fifth districtWith
best wishes for the great temper
ance cause in Mississippi.
II. II. RODGERS, Judge.
Hazlehurst, Miss.
No law has ever been passed in
our statutes that has done so much
to suppress the unlawful sale of
liquors as the law known as "the
Quart-at-a-Time Law." The im
portation of liquors by express
has been reduced over 50 per cent
in my district, to be accurate, 54
per cent. In one town the number
of packages has been reduced 78
per cent. The number of cases
against blind tigers now on file as
compared with same period last
year under gallon law has been
reduced 75 per cent. Nearly all
the liquor brought in under the
quart-at-a-time law is for private
consumption, and not for sale.
This law is a clean knockout for
blind tigers. It is true automobil
ists are bringing liquor through
the country at night from the Isl
and at Vicksburg, but this can be
stopped. The quart at a time law
does prohibit, acd this is the rea
son why the liquor men m New
Orleans and Memphis are making
the fight for its repeal.

OKOLONA. MISSISSIPPI. THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 2. 1916
! Farmers Institute s to
Cairn Unrest of Negroes
: Agricultural College, Mis?.,
Oct. 28 To encourage the ne-
groes 01 Mississippi to remain at
their ffirm work, rather than
follow the lure of soft jobs and
good pay held out by labor agents
from other states, Director E.
R. Lloyd, of the cooperative
extension w'ork of the Mississip
pi A. and M. College and Fed
eral Government is planning a
series of farmers' institutes for
negroes. By teaching the ne
groes better farming methobs,
and pointing out ways of avoid
ing crop failures such as- have
been experienced by some this
year, Professor Lloyd hopes to
increase the usefulness of the
negroes to themselves and to the
state,
been
Much good has already
accomplished along this
line by the several negro county
agents who are working under
the direction of State Demon
stration Agent R, S. Wilson.
The first of these institutes
for negroes will be held as Arte
sia, Mississippi, within the next
fe x days, and Professor Lloyd,
State Agent Wilson, and other
extension workers are scheduled
to speak to the negroes in that
section.
State Comissioner of Agricul
ture P. P. Garner, and the Fed
eral Government have approved
this extension service to 'the ne
gro farm workers. In making
application to the Commissioner
of Agriculture for a farmers' in
suitute for -his people, W. B.
Tucker, a negro teacher of Ar
tesia, sets forth the following
clear cut reasons for the negro
exoduS'to the north, and sug
gests a remedy:
"In view of the fact that large
numbers of our colored people
are leaving for the North and
for other sections of the coun
try," he says, "we who do not
desire to do likewise realize that
some step should be taken with
a view of discouraging the exo
dus. I feel that they are taking
a step that they .will ultimately
regret. True, many of them
will stay away, but many more
will surely become dissatisfied
and return to their old homes in
the South onljK to find to their
sorrow that fheir services are no
longer required.
"The contributory causes of
this unusual Negro Exodus are
many, the most prominent of
which, insofar as the Negro on
the farm is concerned, is his ig
norance of up-ttinlate scientific
methods of farming. Of the
numerous farmers' institutes and
demonstration meetings held in
our conntry, but few-have reach
ed the Negro directly; the mer
its of crop diversifications have
failed to appeal to him in an en
couraging light, and therefore,
one complete failure of the cot
ton and corn crops his only
hobby is sufficient to throw
him into a panic. On the slighl
est inducement, due 'to exagger
ted reports of prosperity else
where he is ready to pack up
and move.
"Farmers' institutes for ne-!
groes will go far towards calm
ing the growing unrest among
the negroes in the rural districts
of our section of the state. If
institutes of this kind are held j
at convenient places in every j
county in the black belt and
such subjects as Diversification
of Crops, Economy on the Farm,
How to grow Cotton in spite of:
the Boll Weevil, and lectures to '
the women oh Domestic Science
be discussed by agricultural ex
perts, a great deal of good will
be done. In every case the lec-
tures should be supplemented by
a speech advising the negroes
against emigration to the North,
by tome of the negro leaders of
the state in whom the people
have confluence. I feel that
such a campaign carried out at
this season'of the year will ac
complish much."
Fall Gardeners Wage
War on Turnip Louse
: Owners of fall gardens in
many parts of Mississippi are
finding that to secure the great
est benefit from their vegetables
it is' necessary to make war on
the Turnip Louse, or False Cab
bage Aphis. Thousands of these
tiny, greenish, soft-bodied in-
sects are attacking crusiferous
plants such as turnips, radishes,
cabbage, mustard, kale, cauli
flower, collards, wild mustard,
wild radish, and shepherd's
purse, sucking the juife from
the leaves.. They are found in
all parts of the country and are
dependent for food onplants of
the cruciferous group, and 'are
now especially damaging tur
nips.. "These insects can be controll
ed by thorough spraying with
contact sprays at intervals of
about a week, beginning before
the plants become badly infect
ed," says R. W. Flamed, State
Entomologist and Professor of
Entomology at the Mississippi
A. and M. College. "As mo3t
of the lice are on. the under side
of the leaves," he continues,
"they are best reached with a
lead of hose from ten to fifteen
feet long fitted with an exten
sion rod of four feet and an an
gle type nozzle' attached by
means of an elbow. Prof. Pad
dock, of Texas, says: 'The se
cret of success in spraying
against the turnip louse is the
use of the angle nozzie and the
elbow.' For. satisfactory re
sults a first class spray pump is
essential.
"Soap solutions and tobacco
extracts are recommended for
use against the pest. The for
mer may be made of ordinary
laundry soap, 1 pounds to 7 gal
lons of water. The soap is shav
ed and boiled is two gallons of
water until it is dissolved. E
nough water is then added to
to make 7 gallons.
"Tobacco extract is most com
monly used in the form of
'Blackleaf 40,' which contains
40 per cent nicotine. One part
of this is used in 1200 parts of
water, with the addition of, one
pound of soap to ten gallons of
the solution.
"Other measures that will
help in reducing these insects
are,. (1) rotation qf crops; (2)
keeping down by clean cultiva
tion such wild cruciferous plants
black mustard, pepper grass,
and shepherd's purse; (3 de
stroying all of the first insects
that appear; (4) early plowing
of fields where crops affected
have been grown."

Six Old Ladies
Regain Health
Famous Medicine Accomplishes
Wonderful Results in Treat
ing infirmities of Old Ag&
For the past year of so, sever
al of the more elderly ladies of
the Old Ladise' Home on Rut
ledge Pike, Nashville, Tenn.,
have been in a very feeble, deli
cate state of health, bordering
at times on what might be term
ed a general decline.
Their failing health was due,
no doubt, in large measure to
the general infirmaties of advanc
ed age, and although they receiv
ed every possible care and atten
tion, they seemed to be beyond
the reach of the treatment ordi
narially administered in su'ch
cases.
At the suggestion of Mrs. Col
ton, the matron of the institu
tion, they concluded to try Tan
lac and it was a happy decision
indeed when they did so. The
reconstructive powers of the
medicine were at once in evi
dence. They began almost im
mediately to feel better, eat bet
ter and rest better. Since that
time the treatment has been con
tinued with the most astonishing
and gratifying results, but let
them tell their own stories in
their own way. Their state
ments are undoubtedly interest
ing. Mrs. Houser was one of the
first to use the medicine, and be
ing at a very advanced age, her
trouble had been more persistent
and difficult to treat, perhaps,
than any of the others. ' Mrs.
Houser said: '
"I had been in a very weak,
nervous state for several years
and have suffered principally
from stomach trouble. I -would
go for months at a time without
eating any solid food and up to a
short time ago, I spent most; of
my time in my room, as I was
too weak to come down stairs.
I ate some corn bread and spare
ribs for dinner today and they
seemed to agree with me per
fectly, as I have suffered no bad
after effects whatever. The
horrible headaches and nervous
ness are gone and I am feeling
so much better in every way."
Mrs. Martin, who was the
next to testify, said:
''I have suffered a great deal
from hard, driving pains in my
head and had had stomach troub
le. I hardly ever have a pain
now, the catarrh no longer trou
bles me and my appetite is much
better."
Mrs. Fink said:
"I was sick all last summer
and I now ieel better and strong
er than in months. I no longer
suffer from the headaches I had
so much."
Mrs. Wallis seemed to be espe
cially delicate and had a' very
weak constitution and weak
stomach. Mrs. Wallis said:
"In only one week after tak
ing your medicine 1 began to
feel greatly improved. I feel
very much stronger, enjoy my
meals more and seem to rest bet
ter at night I expect to con
tinue taking Tanlac."
In referring to the above state
ments, Mr. G. F. Willis, who is
now personally directing the in
troduction of Tanlac throughout
the South, said:
"I consider the statements of
these old ladies the most remark
able that have come under my
observation. I do not hesitate
to say that I believe these in
dorsements to be the strongest
that have ever been received by
a proprietary meidcine of any
No. 45.
character."
Quoting from Mr. Cooper's,
lectures, Mr. Willis said:
"When people grow to ripe
old age their digestive organs
lack vitality, arid begin to act
more slowly and less effectively
than in youth. The circulation
becomes poor, the blood gets
thin the appetite fails and the
digestion weak.'
"Tanlac, the powerful recon
structive tonic, is the ideal
strengthener and body builder
for old folks, because it creates
a healthy appetite, strengthens
digestion, enriches the blood and
in this manner builds up, stren
gthens digestion, , enriches the
blood and in this natural manner
builds up, strengthens and in
vigorates feeble, run-down," ner
vous people, and is an unfailing
source of comfort to the aged
and infirm."

Business Men's Club Organized
Thursday night of last week
quite a number of business men
met at the court house and or
ganized "The Okolona Business
Men's Club" with a membership
of about half a hundred, which
was more than doubled by the
committee on membership by
the second meeting Tuesday
night This was decidedly the
best--public meeting we have
ever attended in this city. The
spirit of get-together pervaded
throughout with every man, ap
parently, willing to work for all
and all willing to work for every
man. The officers elected were
as follows: R. J. West, Presi
ident; B. F. Ellis, Vice-President;
W. E. Savage, Treasurer; W. E.
Roberts, Jr., Secretary; and W.
E. Savage, A. L. Jagoe, R. W.
Chandler, C. A. LaGrone and
Herman Cole", Board of Directors.
The question ,of securing a
farm demonstrator for this sec
tion was brought up and the
unaminous opinion was in favor '
of such a demonstrator. In
about 20 minutes the money
guarantees were made and the-'
authorization for employment,
given.
The organization of this body
means a great deal to the city as.
a whole. Most of the business
men have enlisted in the move
ment We should be glad to see
all do so, but if you will not and
are a knocker, lay aside your
hammer while your fellows are
are trying to do you good.
The Redpath Lyceum Course
showed up last week with Ralph
Bingham, pianist violinist and'
humorist Good humor was his
strong point and he kept the
house in a roar from start to fin
ish. He has been before the
public 35 years, commencing as
the boy orator when he was six
years old. If you can't laugh
keep out of his way. He ap
peared before an Okolona andi
ence some years age and some
of them were expecting a rare
treat and were not disappointed.
Keep a look out for the Redpaths
at the Star Theatre.
