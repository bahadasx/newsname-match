' QUESTIONS NO. 26.
Editor of tbe !Cresset: We
'live Questions ask6d that were
ef n real importance, Here is
one of vital import.
Jesus taught us to pray, "lead
na not into temptation,"
Question; Does Qod lead us
Into temptation?
If so, under Diyine leadership
bow can we escape?
Do we sin if we yield to the
Divine tempter?
How can I reconcile tbla pray
er with James 1;13. "God can
not be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth he any man.';
. I am lost in tbe darkness, hold
yoar lamp higher, please.

wLiie to discuss in the Cresset.

Dear Reader.
The Ed. ol "The Worlds
Cresset." Does nor claim to be
born of God, By the power of
the Holy Ghost. Born of woman
by man, And at the age of 80
years converted to God, to
preach his word. And now if
myself or Mr. Hollenbeck is one
of them spoken of oi Psalms 53

we were born. If not then Mr.

To The;- Voters Of
Wright Coaaty.
I find it absolutely impossible
to see each votgr in Wright Cou
nty as well as to viait many of
the various localities and while it
would certainly bo a yleasure to
meet und talk fr'th each voter I
am compelled to do what I be-
lcive to be the' next best thine
and that is to address an open
letter to the public.
I have always firmly believed
that tbe voters were entitled to
knew just what a candidate for
office considered his duties and
I am writing this letter that each
voter may have something tangi
ble from which he may dfctsr
mine my fitness for the office
which I seek. .Having hulped my
father Geo. W, .Rippeu make his
records while Assessor from
1U01 to 1U05 and having open a
cloe observer of this office since
I that date I make the following
pledges which I am confident I
will fulfill if lam elected,
1st. I will guarantee a fair and
equitable assessment. "By this I
mean that my standard for asse
srn'ent will be inanrproperty
withont considering bis standing
either soo'ally or financially or
politically, No pets. No favorites
Rich and poor alike
2nd, I will guarantee a correct
assessment of every sob ool dls
trict according to the district
plats
3rd. I will guarantee that in
making the Asspssoi-s Books I
wm plat l))a Gntir county secti
on by spction. For instance the
Land Tax Bonk is made up by
Section 1 numbers and not by
owners name and if yon have
land in three sections your name
must appear on the tax hook
three times. By platting and
checking in the nanner I state
double assessments will be elim
inated and a correct assessment
assured,
4tb. I will guarantee to man
tain an office in the County Seat
during my terra of office,
I firmly believe that I can he
of great service to the people in
this office and I will take great
pleasure in serving you, I
promise yqu that I will spare
neither time nor labor in malting
the most correct set of Tax
Books in tbo history of the
county,
Hoping to receive your s,up:
port and assuring yon the abeve
pledges will be fulfilled I remain
Your for efficient service,
Wm. F, Rippee.

HOW NRD BARRED OUT
ALCOHOL.
I
if you won't invito it in as a,
. i
guest. I've heard Unde Tom sav j
oinhnl will t,rv t:i sneak lutu i
your blood like a thief. So I've
gone around and birred all the
doors.
First I've ordered tobacco to
keep out, because tobacco slips
the door opn for alcohol before
you knov-; it.
Then I locked the cider door
tight It didn't look very danger
ous but a taste for alcohol will
creep in through a cat hole.
