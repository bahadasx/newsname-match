NEW YORK, Nov. 2 President
Wilson arrived from upstate campaign
today and boarded the government
yacht Mayflower for a political con
ference. Lack of time compelled the
cancellation of a part of the program.
No announcement is yet made regard
ing the Marina disaster, said the presi
dent. The president addressing the Busi
ness Men's League today, criticized
business "for resisting changes," de
claring that Wall street lacked vision.
Men who treated employes as partners
are the most prosperous, said he. The
amount of genius exerted resisting
changes in existing conditions, contin
ued the president, "is a great indict
ment, and brains have been burned -put
acting as brakes."
ROBBERS MAKE CLEAN UP
IN ILLINOIS VILLAGE
(By Associated Press.)
BRAIDWOOD, Ills, Nov. 2. Four
automobile bandits operating quietly
and not disturbing the sleeping village
watchman, cut all telephone and tele
graph wires last night, isolating this

000. A posse is in pursuit.

PHOENIX, Nov. 2. So great is the
overwhelming sentiment in favor of
Tom Campbell, Republican candidate
for governor, that preparations have
been made to. form "Make It Unani
mous" Clubs to further his election
during the remaining days of the cam
paign. And, according to Republican lead
ers, it looks like "Campbell Unani
mous." Reports from all parts of Arizona
have been so favorable toward the
chances of Tom Campbell that local
voters of all political faiths have de
cided to form several "Make It Unani
mous" Clubs. The idea met with in
stant favor and scores of voters are
daily telephoning to Republican head
quarters asking to have their names
included in the new organization.
It is expected that several similar
clubs will be formed in many other
towns in the state as a result of the
great number of voters who are rally
ing to the head of the Republican
ticket. So great has been the rush
thus far that it rppears as though par
tisanship has been placed in the dis
card. The statements issued by Thomas
Maddock, chairman of the Republican
state central committee and Allan B.
Jaynes, national Republican commit
teeman, that both Campbell and Kib
bey, would csrry the state have not
met with the approval of the Demo
cratic publicity bureau but the organ
izing of "Make It Unanimous" Clubs
and the rapidly swelling membership
in this organization seems to streng
then the contention of Republican
leaders. '
From now until November 7 the plea
will be "Make it Unanimous."

BISBEE, Ariz., Nov. 2. Early in the
campaign, much was made by his op
ponents over the fact that Tom Camp
bell ate a plate of hot cakeB and drank
a cup of coffee in a picketed Bisbee
restaurant run by Bill Traux, a friend
of twenty years' standing.
It now develops that not only Gover;
nor Hunt, Mr. Campbell's opponent"
but also Henry Ashurst and Carl Hay
den, while in Bisbee took most of their
meals at the Copper Queen Dining
room, which was declared unfair by
the Warren District Trades' Council,
along with Bill Traux.
The Copper Queen Hotel does not
employ union waiters, is still on the
unfair list, the fact is well known in
Bisbee and was known to Hunt, Hay
den and Ashurst, but they evidently
thought no mention. would OSaMaa'de' of
it because the Copper Queen Dining
room was not picketed.
Hunt avoids picketed restaurants
for political reasons and not out of
sympathy for the unions and has no
hesitancy in eating in unfair places
as long as there is no danger of get
ting caught.
BUYING FURNITURE IN EUROPE
LONDON. Nov. 2. Bond street deal
ers in antique,' and "sham antique"
furniture declare that the war-lull in
local trade has been more than offset
by American buying. These Ameri
cans do not seem the least perturbed
by the high ocean rates. They are,
however, driving better bargains than
in the old days. It is no longer the
custom to palm off sham antiques for
reel. It is said that people of moder
ate means are perfectly content to
have things look l'ke the most valuable
article at a correspondingly cheap fig
ure. "We are getting Americans now,"
one dealer is quoted as saying, "but
there is not so much to be made out
of them. They know what they want,
and what is more they know the price
they want to pay."
GERMANS LOSE FORTIFICATIONS
WON BY THE CROWN PfilNCE
EL PASO, Nov. 2. Col. Rosario

mediate execution, it is claimed.

ON THE WAR FRONT. The Ger
msnr hao evacuated Forvaux, one of
the most important fortifications which
the German crown prince captured
during the prolongued Verdun drive.
Fartvaux was endangered when the
French recently recaptured Fort Dou-
aumont with a wide portion of the ad
jacent front. Observers considered
Vaux' Sail only a question of time. Vir
tually all the important ground east of
the Meuse, taken by the Germans dur
ing the winter and spring Verdun of
fenses now is lost to the allies. The
French have gained somewhat on the
Somme front but Berlin still claimed
that the main British-French attacks
have failed.
