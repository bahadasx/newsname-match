region regained by the French on
October 25th, it was pointed out that
Fort Vaux had been put into a peril

beyond the fort on each side. The
Germans evacuated Fort Vaux during

French continued to pour a heavy
fire on the fort.

BUSINESS IS BETTER
Superintendent Ribble of the Postal
Sees Great Prosperity Ahead
for the South
Superintendent G. W. Ribble of the
Postal Telegraph company arrived in
Ocala today from Atlanta, to inspect
a hew line which the Postal company
is building north from Ocala and
which will be completed the first of
next week.
This will add materially to the
telegraphic facilities of Ocala, mak
ing outlets in three directions over
the Postal system. The new line goes
by way of Mcintosh, where an office
will probably be opened .in a "short
time. -'
In discussing general business con
ditions, Mr. Ribble said to the Star
reporter: "While the tax upon our
facilities is of course greatest in the
manufacturing east and food produc
ing and exporting west, business has
increased satisfactorily, in. the" South,
and we are preparing for unprece
dented demands, as soon as the Euro
pean war is over, permitting the re
lease of munition carrying vessels to
turn to the movement of southern
timber, phosphate, cotton and other
products. My company is especially
confident regarding the development
of Florida," he added, "as is evidenced
by the fact that it has more than
doubled its wire mileage in this state
within the past five years, and has
further extensions and investments in
view."
Among the more recent additions
to the "Postal's Florida connections
are Leesburg and Bartow. Mr. Rib
ble's boyhood years were spent in
Florida, and he has taken a senti
mental and especial interest in the de
velopment of competitive telegraph
service in the state of his early adop

(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 2. State depart
ment officials today awaited Ger
many's version of the sinking of the
British steamer Marina with the loss
of six or more American lives. The
department also expected affidavits
and other data gathered from the
American survivors.
Great importance is attached to
an Athens news dispatch received
last night, saying the Greek govern
ment has been notified that Germany
intended to sink without warnig all
ships carrying supplies to the Allies.
As far as is known the United
States has received no such notifica
tion. The United States would regard
such a procedure as directly contrary
to Germany's pledges.
SOME WARM STUFF
Messrs. Bell, Smith and Nugent Dis
cuss their Comparative Merits
as Democrats. 7. . , v
Editor Star; I notice with inter
est your recent article on "Breaking
Up the Democratic Party," and notice
that you charge the Rev. S. J. Tom
Cat with this attempt in which you
are entirely correct. You state in
your article that the Cattsites and the
republicans have entered into a com
bination to defeat two of our local
democratic nominees, Alfred Ayer
and P. H. Nugent and that all good
loyal democratic voters should, stand
by the nominees. I am and have al
ways voted the democratic ticket,
both state and national. As is Frank
Adams, independent candidate for
sheriff, so is the Rev. Tom Cats both
bolters of the democratic party, and
I am informed and believe it to be
tiue that P. H. Nugent, this the dem
ocratic party's nominee for clerk of
the circuit court, has contributed
money to the campaign fund of the
Rev, S. J. Tom Cats, the bolter and
independent candidate for governor
against the. regular nominee, W. V.
Knott; that the said Nugent has stat
ed that he would not vote for W. V.
Knott if he should be the nominee
of the democratic party or be so de
clared the party's nominee; that he
will support Frank Adams, bolter and
independent candidate for sheriff
against Galloway, regular democratic
nominee, that the said Nugent has
stated in the conduct of the people's
office he holds given to him by the
white democratic party of this county
that he preferred to deal with or
transact the business of his office with
a negro than a white man!
It is street talk that the present
county judge, W. E. Smith, is offer
ing to bet (betting on elections being
prohibited by law) that the Rev. S. J.
Tom Cats will be elected governor
and that he, the said Judge Smith
when asked declines to state whether
he expects to vote for W. V. Knott,
regular democratic nominee or in
tends to vote for the Rev. S. J. Tom
Cats and Frank Adams, both bolters
of the democratic party! . .
So please tell me wherein I, a dem
ocrat, should vote for P. H. Nugent
for clerk or Smith for judge, when it
is apparent that they are intending to
bolt the democratic party and to sup
port these two bolters, Rev. Tom
Cats and Frank Adams?
Yours, Joseph Bell,
A Loyal Democrat Until Nov. 8th,
but Afterwards I Know Not What.
P. S. Isn't each man who supports
an independent candidate for an office
against the regular democratic nom
inee just as much a bolter a3 the can
didate, and isn't the democrat who
stays home on election day just as
much a bolter as the other two? I
think so, and would like to know what
you think about it. Joseph Bell.

Captain Koenig Allows Only Govern
ment Officials to View
His Craft
(Associated Press)
New London, Nov. 2. The German
merchant submarine Deutschland is
still closely guarded. Captain Koenig
has refused the plea that the public
be allowed to view the craft. None
but government or city officials will
be allowed to enter the enclosure, he
said.

but little work was done on the cargo.

ocrat than Joe Bell. He states that
until Nov. 8 he is a democrat, but that
afterwards he knows not what. I am
a democrat now and intend to remain
one, not only because my father was
a democrat but because I. believe in
democratic principles.
On November 7th I intend to vote
the straight democratic ticket from
Woodrow Wilson down.
W. E. Smith.
From Clerk Nugent
The above communication was orig
inally sent to the Star as an anony
mous communication, signed Jim
Jackson, and the Star refused to pub
lish it. An examination of Joe Bell's
docket showed the name of Jim Jack
son, a colored man, written in Bell's
own hand in his docket when judge
and a comparison of handwriting
showed that Bell was the author of
the anonymous communication. Tq
day I asked him to sign the communi
cation with his own name and he did
so. "
. I want to say first that I have
never promised Frank Adams to vote
for him nor have I made Galloway
any promises. I have simply stayed
out of the Adams-Galloway and the'
Catts-Knott fight and attended quiet
ly to the work of the clerk's office.
Everybody knows that I made a clean
fight for the clerk's office and won oS
and it affords me pleasure to believe
that I won out without the help of
Judge Bell.
Judge Bell does not know what he
will be after Nov. 7th. I do; I will
be Nov. 7th, and after Nov. 7th, a
democrat who never in his life voted
against any nominee of a democratic
primary or convention, nor even
scratched one. In the primary elec
tion I voted for Hudson and for Far-
ris, and have no apology to make.
When Mr. Catts was declared the
nominee I accepted him fully as the
party nominee and made one contri
bution, and one only, to his campaign
fund, when he was absolutely the
nominee and before there had been
any recount. I have refused to get
mixed up in any Catts-Knott fight,
believing that men like Bell, whose
democracy in my opinion depends al
most wholly upon whether they or
their friends are elected to office,
were simply trying to find some ex
cuse to make a fight against me, in
the face of the fact that they knew
that I was the certain nominee of a
primary, in which they took part and
by which every clean man should be
honorably bound.
Now every man is entitled to his
own opinion and the gentleman has
stated his opinion and belief as ex
pressed in his communication but if
my own democracy was as uncertain
as I believe Judge Bell's, on a state
ment, over his own signature, I think
that I would flock with July Brown.
Respectf ally, P. H. Nugent. -
