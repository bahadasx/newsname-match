Terrc Haute, Ind., Xov. 1.—Charles
E. Hughes, speaking before an audi­
ence that crowded every available
foot o£ the big wigwam here tonight,
declared that, while he understood
union labor had been told officially to
vote against him, he knew that no­
body could direct or control the labor
vote, and that it would lie cast ac­
cording to its sober judgment.
Winds Up Middle West Campaign.
Charles E. Hughes wound up his
campaign in Ihe Middle West with a'
speech here tonight and left after­
wards for points in New York, the
last state in which he will appear be­
fore election.
Mr. Hughes made five speeches to­
day, in which he outlined policies he
intends to follow if elected, assailed
the administration for the enactment
of flie Underwood tariff an$ Ajlapison
laws, and expteftsteff the Ijglief that
lie would win. He spoke tonight be­
fore an audience in the wigwam here
after reviewing a torchlight parade.
Speaks on Tariff.
iMr. Hughes, on his final day in the
middle west, devoted much of his
speeches to the tariff. He addressed
two audiences at Linton and Brazil,
composed largely of employes of coal
mining companies.
"We had soup houses and bread
lines 20 months ago," he told his audi­
ence at Linton,, "and we will have
them again if we do not protect Am­
erican industry and if we attempt to
carry on the business of this country
on the policy indicated in the Under­
wood bill."
Discusses Adamson Bill.
In his speech here tonight Mr.
Hughes discussed the Adamson bill at
length.
"I think it will be found that the
Adamson bill is a gold brick for la­
bor. That it is not any eight-hour
work day bill. There was not any
eight-hour work day proposition in­
volved in it. There never was.
Things that are right can walk in
their own clothes we can have things
that are right it' we go at them in the
right way."
In discussing the tariff. Mr. Hughes
told the mine workers at Linton and
Brazil that nothing was more import­
ant to them than the prosperity of
the iron and .steel industry.
Prosperity Due.to War.
"We know that on account of the
European war the exports of iron and
steel jumped in a year from $251
'000.000 to over $621,000,000," he said,
"an increase of two and a half times,
because of the great demand created
by thi European war.
"You have something besides this
great, strong America that we talk
about in such eloquent phrases and
you have got to have something more
than these alert and splendid men.
You have go to have business policies
that protect the industries of the
United States."
Ryan Hearing
Waits Arrival
Of Witnesses
John Ryan, as he stepped outside
the prison doors which had harbored
him for ight months and eighteen
days, was arrested by Sheriff French
yesterday on a fugitive warrant, is­
sued on the strength of extradition
papers held by Sheriff G. W. Hill of
Harrison, Neb., where Ryan is wanted
to answer to a charge of forgery pre­
ferred against one John Neary.
Ryan is lighting extradition, contend­
ing he is not the man described. He
is held in the county jail pending the
arrival from Nebraska of witnesses
for whom Sheriff Hill has sent with a
view to establishing the identity of the
prisoner. Ryan was sent up from Far­
go for forgery. He had a year's time
to do, but his good behavior cut down
his prison term three months and
twelve days.
Excellent Record for Carriers
Shown in Biennial Report of
Commission
SHORTEST LINE IS LESS
THAN FIVE MILE LONG
Some Are Very Short and Some
Are Long—Recommendations
for Legislature
Not a single passenger was killed on
all the thousands of miles of North
Dakota railways during the biennial
period ending August 31, 191(i, the re­
port of the state railroad commission
shows. In the two years covered, a
total of thirty-six met death on North
Dakota steam lines. Of these, sixteen
were "non-trespassers," fifteen were
trespassers, and five were employes.
The Great Northern had the heaviest
death record, with a total of eighteen.
Nine were killed on the Northern Pa­
cific Ave on the Soo line three on the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul and
one by the Farmerp' Grain and Sliip
pfn&'Co.
For the two years, 8#6 casualties
are reported. Of these, 114 are report­
ed as occurring to passengers 634 to
employes 28 to trespassers and thirty
to non-trespassers. The Great North­
ern reported 898 accidents, the North­
ern Pacific 216, the Soo line 161, and
the Milwaukee 31.
6,200.13 Mile* of Railway.
The commisson reports that 6,200.13
miles of railway were operated in
North Dakota on August 31, 1916. The
state's longest railway is the Great
Northern, with 2.270.95 miles of main
line, secondary line, branch lines, side
tracks and second tracks. North Da­
kota's baby steam-line is the Devils
Lake & Chautauqua railway, with 4.75
miles of main line and a half-mile side­
track. Next in total mileage to the
Great Northern is the Northern Paci­
fic, with 1,873.66 miles of track. The
Soo line reports 1,426.83 miles: the
Milwaukee line, 427.79: the Brandon,
Devils Lake & Southern, 57.91: the
Midland Continental, 91.32 the North­
ern Dakota Railway Co., 22.40: the
Farmers' Grain & Shippers Co., 57.91
the Chicago & North Western, 15.73,
and the Fairmount & Veblen Railway
Co.. 14.15 miles.
Adjustment of Claims.
With reference to the handling of
claims, the commission calls the at­
tention of shippers to the fact that the
courts of North Dakota and the United
States have held that shippers must
present their claims within four
months from the time of delivery of
the shipment under the old form of bill
of lading, and within six months from
the time of delivery under the new
form of bill, or claims are barred by
law because of these clauses in the
bills of lading.
Recommendations.
The commission recommends to the
next legislature that the constitution
be amended to permit the establishing
of a six-years term for commissioners,
this being the rule in other states
where commissioners are elected, and
that terms of different duration be
fixed in order that ubt one commission

J. B." IS NEW
MAN OF MYSTERY
Chairman Lempke Runs Down
Identity of Independent Pub
licity Bureau
Fargo, N. D., Nov. 1.—The question
who wrote and who paid for a politi­
cal advertisement that appeared in a
few state papers within the last few
days is agitating the various Demo­
cratic campaign headquarters in Far­
go.
The advertisement is one signed "In­
dependent Publicity Bureau, Bismarck,
which on its face, appears to be dfe
signed to further the campaign of
President Wilson, John Burke, the
Democratic candidate for senator, and
D. H. McArthur of Fargo, who is sup­
posed to be the Democratic candidate
for governor.
Where Rub Comes.
This is where the rub comes in, for
the Democratic headquarters in Fargo,
directed by State Chairman Fred Mc­
Lean, has been keeping just as quiet
as possible about McArthur's claims
on the governorship in the hope that
if nothing is done to injure Frazier
the Non-Partisan league support can
be weaned away from McCumber and
brought into the Burke campaign. In
fact McArthur has openly charged
that- he has "been sacrificed to fuilheY
Burke's ChatiCes df reaching the sen­
ate.
Attacks Frazier.
The ad does more than boost McAr­
thur, however. It makes an open at­
tack on Frazier, terming him as unfit,
to be governor because of lack of ex­
perience, and declares that he is the
candidate of a machine.
So valuable did Republican State
Chairman Lemke consider the "ad"
from his standpoint that he had a
large section of it reproduced in a
page advertisement in this week's is­
sue of the Non-Partisan Leader. Now
Burke's headquarters in Fargo are
busy declaring that the advertisement
is fraudulent and that it is a Republi­
can trick to help out Hughes and Mc­
Cumber by linking Burke and Wilson
with an attack on the farmers' candi­
date.
Moth Republican and Democratic
state headquarters confess that they
have been doing some sleuthing to
find out the real authorship of the ad.
Chairman Wm. Lemke points to the
fact that other advertising over the
signature, "Independent Publicity Bu­
reau. Bismarck, N. I).," has consisted
of red hot attacks on McCumber
which no one could suspect of being

DEUTSCHLAND CARRIES COSTLY CARGO
FACTS
Conflicting Elements Appear In
Recent Destruction of British
Ship Marina
ARMAMENT OF VESSEL TO
BE THE LEADING POINT
Lansing Asserts United States
Will Take Same Stand as in
Sussex Note
Washington, Nov. 1.—So many con­
flicting elements have appeared so
far in the destruction of the British
ship, Marina, by a German subma­
rine, with loss of American lives, that
the incident threatens to lull into a
technical discussion rather than a
clean-cut issue of .whether Germany
has violated her pledges to the Unit­
ed States. It became quite apparent
today, both from the attitude of the
state department and cable dispatch­
es, that much which is essential to a
determination of the responsibility
remains undisclosed. indeed, the
United States. Germany or Great Brit­
ain are not in the possession of the
full facts.
It appeared certain, however, that
no move will lie made hy the United
States until the German version of
the affair, as well as that of the de­
struction «of the British ship, Rowan
more, by shell lire, endangering Am­
ericans, has been obtained.
Requests Full Details.
Positive developments today were
the action of Count, von Bernstorff,
the German ambassador, Tfo asking-lifer
government to forward full details by
wireless, and the issuance of a state­
ment by Secretary Lansing that the
investigation would be in no wise de­
layed because there is a political cam­
paign in progress.
Two Facts Attract Attention.
While they await full details, two
outstanding facts attracted the atten
tion of officials.
One was the announcement that the
Marina was armed with', a 4.7-inch
gun, mounted astern the other was a
news dispatch from London, the lan­
guage of which was regarded as sig­
nificant. It said:
"It is regarded here as quite prob­
able that the American state depart­
ment will make still further inquiries
with the object of definitely determin­
ing the status of the Marina. While
it is said that she was under private
charter when she was torpedoed, it
appears that the vessel may have en­
gaged in admiralty work not long
before."
Doubt in London.
This was generally construed as re­
flecting some indication of doubt in
London over whether the ship was en­
titled to the immunities of a peaceful
merchantman.
The question of the Marina's arma­
ment, however, is likely to 'become the
point on which the case will revolve,
unless other circumstances arise as
to clearly define the issue in another
direction.
Countries Hold Different Views.
It. brings the submarine question
back to a point where Germany and
the United States have held to di­
rectly opposite views.
If the case narrows down to a
question of armament, the outcome
would appear to hinge upon whether
the Marina resisted the submarine or
attempted to flee. The mere question
of armament for defensive purposes,
such as is usual upon merchant ships,
would seem to be eliminated so far
as the United States is concerned.
United States Stands Firm.
iMr. Lansing announced today that
the United States stood on the same
ground it took in the Sussex note.

me any good after going, he'd want to.
He'd want, me to eat him, and I'm go­

RUSSIANS AGAIN
ASSUME OFFENSIVE
London. Xov 1,—Hard fighting Is
again taking place on the Somrae front
in Prance between the Entente allies
and the Germans. Since Tuesday, the
British and French near Courcelette
and on the Les Boeufs-Gueuedcourt
front, and to the south, have been at­
tacking violently, with the Germans
tenaciously holding them back, except
to the east of Les Boeufs, where com'
bined Entente forces have gained some
ground, and to the west of Les Bouefs,
in the St. Pierre Vaast wood, and near
Sailly-Saillisel. where the men of Gen­
eral Foch took additional German
trenches. Between Les Ars and Gue
uedecourt and in the vicinity of the
Seliwaben redoubt the Germans are
heavily bombarding British positions.
Roumanians Continue Drive.
On the Transylvania front, the Rou­
manians are keeping up their drive on
the Austro-C.ermans in the Juil valley,
but, according to Petrograd, the Teu­
tons have occupied two villages south
of the Rothenthurm pass. In the Preal
pass sector, the Germans have pene­
trated Roumanian positions and cap­
tured ten cannon, and seventeen ma­
chine guns.
Russians Take Offensive in Galieia.
Again the Russians have assumed
the offensive in Galieia. along the Xar
ayuvka river, and in the Michiasouv
region. Berlin records the repulse of
live heavy attacks in the former dis­
trict, and Petrograd admits that the
Russians, in the latter zone, have been
pressed back by superior Teutonic
forces.
Bad Weather in Macedonia.
Bad weather is again hampering op­
erations on the Macedonian front.
Bombardments East of Gorigia.
With the advent of fine weather in
the Austro-Italian theater, artillery en­
gagements are being fought all along
the line. The bombardments are es­
pecially violent east of Gorizia and on
the Carso plateau.

Will Leave in Fortnight.
"I must keep up this traffic alone lor
the present, that is, the Deutschland
must." he said. "In a fortnight I shall
be gone. 1 hope to return before the
end of the year."
It was possible, the navigator stated,
that other submarines would be built
by that time.
Quiet Trip Says Captain.
In a summary of his voyage, just
completed, Captain Koenig, who re­
turned with decorations from German
royalty, as marks of recognition for
his pioneer voyage, said this was "a
quiet trip." Recital of its incidents,
however, developed matters of lively
interest. The Deutschland did not lie
on the ocean's floor this time, as in
the voyage which ended at Baltimore
last July. The submarine, instead
varied the monotony of its sailing un­
der water or on the surface with oc­
casional dodges beneath vessels identi­
fied as warships of belligerent nation­
ality or thought to be such craft. Sev­
en times, Captain Koenig said, he nan
euvered in this way. The last time
was off Nantucket, yesterday, "when
he sighted a four-funneled steamer,"
and dived beneath her. During the
trip of 4,"oo miles, the Deutschland
traveled under water less than 100
miles, "9."), I should think," Captain
Koenig said.
Infantile Paralysis Relief.
To nest ions whether the submar­
ine brought to this country, among its
(li ng consignments, any medicine that
might contain relief from infantile par­
alysis, Captain Koenig replied In the
negative. There is such a serum in
Germany, he said, but its development
requires test through monkeys.
Classed as Merchantman.
A cursory examination of the sub«
marine by collector of customs, Mc
ovem today, developed nothing, he
said, that would conflict with her clas­
sification as a merchantman. The fact
that the Deutschland was officially
classed as such at Baltimore will have
no bearing on her standing at present,
it was said.
Negotiate for Mali Service.
Washington. Nov 1.—Interest her*
in the arrival of the German submar­
ine Deutschland at New London, Conn.,
on her second voyage, centered today
largely on negotiations for establish*
ing a submarine line mail service be­
tween the United States and Germany.
The post office department let it be
known that it was ready to accept a
proposal made through the German
embassy that the Deutschland and any
sister ships that may ply out of Amer­
ican ports carry not more than 300
pounds of first class mail, at the regu­
lar trans-Atlantic rates.
Details of the arrangements will b«i
worked out at conferences between
officials of the embassy and the depart­
ment, and it is hoped that an agree*
nient may be reached in time for the
Deutschland to take her first consign*
nient of mail when she sails from Xe*
London.
