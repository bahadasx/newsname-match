THE THIRD AMENDMENT
Will Its Passnge be a Benefit or
a Detriment
Read the testimony of Gordon Jones
president of one of the biggest bunks in
Denver and the west which he gave in
an address before the Third Amend
ment Association at a dinner at the
Coates House Kansas City last week
He held before his hearers n picture
of Denver a hustling western city of
approximately 230000 people without
the booze incubus a city of increas
ed luxuries augmented bank desposits
and depleted jails t Denver without
remorse
He told of women who no longer
bend over the washtub of increased
rents and not a really comfortable Hat
or bungalow in the city without u ten
ant He told of collections that have
gone up 48 per cent and he said a sur
prising thing He said that if the
people of Colorado had to ole on pro
hibition u second time the majority
that made the state dry would be more
than doubled
And two years ago when they were
to vote the saloon out of the state the
wets of the great staU of Colorado were
predicting business stagnation and
awful calamity to the big cities of the
state if the saloon was driven out
And right now the brewery interests
of this state are telling the people of
Missouri the same things and some
folks believe them
