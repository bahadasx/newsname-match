night. In the three times a week
we believe that advertisers will se

way we will not be forced to work
such long hours at the office. Then
the advertiser can follow his ad
vertisements in series. Our press
and machinery being such that to

require considerable of an invest

Gov. Gardner Here.

candidate for Governor, made a
splendid speech at the opera house

friends. This is Oil. Gardner's
first visiuhere and till who heard

bandied the questions of the hour
in an able manner. Col. Gardner
is a successful business man, will
make Missouri a Governor who will
go down in history with a record
of having accomplished much for

Soldiers Still For Wilson.
Last week when the special train
with Chas W. Fairbanks and party
was here, the statement was made
that the soldiers on the border were
displeased with President Wilson
and tales that would anger any
true citizen were told. We did not
say anything last week but we got
busy uml after interviewing parents
who have boys on the border and
some who have even been into
Mexico, we leel that we are justified
in saying that the Judge's story
was campaign dope. Win. F. Wal
ler who inlisted at Hannibal last
summer and left there the 21 of
June, was in this city Saturday.
He has been in Laredo, Texas and
when we asked him about condi
tions, said he could sDeak for his
Company and thnt they were
strong for Wilson.
Evan Green has been in Mexico
He has not seen Carranzas soldiers
insulting our flag.
Jus. Lee Hayden belongs to the
Second Missouri Cavalry. Me is
at Nogales, Arizona. He has ul
ready served six years and is en'
listed for thiee years longer. Eigh
teen months was spent in the Phil
linines. His father says he is an
enthusiastic Wilson man.
Stanley Starrett. who is at El
paso is not old enough to vote, but
we were given to understand that
if he could vote it would be for
Wilson.
Harold Davenport is still in
Texas. The family have heard
nothing of him along the line pre
sented at the depot last Wednesday
They assuerd us that it is safe to
say he is still for Wilson.
Edgar McCann wrote home re
cently and asked if it looked favor
able for Wilson's re-election' and
said that if every body wa like
the people down there Wilson
would surely be elected. Ed (far is
stationed at Llano Grande. Texas.
We feel sure the Judge exagger
ated when he told his story of
conditoni on the border.
