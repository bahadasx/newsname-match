SIXTEEN HNS HUE '
KILLED Oil BRITISH STEAMER
SINKING OF MARINA RESULTS
IN HEAVY LOSS OF
, - .I.IFF. .
London, Nov. 1. With best in
formation reaching the American
embassy here, inclusive of both of
ficial reports from Consul Frost at
Qucenstown and private advices
reaching Consul-Gcneral Skinner,
placing the total missing as the result
of the sinking of the British steamer
Marina off the Irish coast yesterday
Inter dispatches seemed to confirm
a probable loss of life among Ameri
can members of the crew.
Mr. Skinner's private dispatch
said that among the survivors landed
at Crookhaven were 16 Americans,
and as the vessel is said to have car
ried 4l or 50 Americns in her crew
of 104, fears are expressed here that
the majority of the 13 missing and
now practically given up as dead may
be American citizens.
According to a private telegram
received by Mr. Skinner survivors
report two boats containing t3 men
left the Marina at the same time and
have not been accounted for. (This
telegram evidently was sent before
news had been received that 52 more
survivors had landed at Castletown.)
The weather was unusually severe at
the time the Marina was sunk and has
been since then.
The Marina was first struck
amidships. A terrific explosion oc
curred on the starboard side. The
second torpedo struck the bow and
the steamship went down almost im
mediately in two parts. It is report
ed seven men were killed while at
tempting to get into the boats.
Sailors saw the wake of a torpedo,
according to these advices, and un
til the ship was struck thought it was
a fish.
ment committee and local citizens
got busy, however, and experienced
little difficulty in findinp rooms for
all the visitors. They are comfort
ably housed and everything possible
is being done to see that they enjoy
their stay here.
"The city is attractively decorated
for the reunion, public buildings,
banks, stores and other structures
all displaying the Union and Confed

electric lights are stretched acr-'ss

PROHIBITION STATUTES
ENACTED BEFORE CON-
STITUTION CHANGED.
REFERENDUM HELD
AS INAPPLICABLE
Supreme Court Hands Down
Decision Rendering Ballot
ing: Unnecessary.
Holding that the prohibition sta
tutes of Mississippi were enacted
prior to the time the constitution was
changed to include the right of ref
erendum, the supreme court on Mon
day handed down a decree which
renders it unnecessary for voters to
ballot on the quart-at-o-time law
and the law prohibiting newspapers
from ' publishing whiskey advertise
ments in the election next Tuesday,
and, under the terms of the decree,
these laws will remain in force per
petually unless repealed by the legis
lature at some future date.
The decree occasioned no surprise,
having in fact, been confidently ex
pected by both those who favor the
laws and those who oppose them.
Notwithstanding this fact, however,
it was necessary for Secretary of
State Power to make provision for
submitting the laws to the people,
and this he did, the text of both laws
having been printed in full on sam
ple ballots sent out to election com
missioners in various counties
throughout "the state to serve as
guides to them in having tickets
printed for local balloting. This
sample ballot was followed by elec
tion commissioners in Lowndes as
well as in other counties throughout
the state, and all have prepared bal
lots containing the two laws in ques
tion. It is now too late to have new
tickets printed, so it will be incum
bent upon qualified electors to dis
regard the two laws pertaining to
liquor and to vote merely on the can
didates and the remaining questions
which are to be presented to them
for consideration.
The following details from Jack
son gives the details of the decree:
"In a decision of the Sam Jones
case Monday morning, the supreme
court held that inasmuch as the
quart-at-a-time liquor law and the
anti-advertising law were passed by
the legislature prior to the placing
into the constitution of the initiative
and referendum amendment, these
two measures cannot be submitted to
the people for ratification or rejec
tion at a referendum election on No
vember 7.
"This means a referendum election
on the Richardson game law will be
held on November 7, as the latter
measure was passed by the legisla
ture after the initiative and referen
dum amendment had been made a
part of the constitution."
fl jSNXIOUS 10 RETURN
LABORERS LURED WESTWARD
REPENT BEFORE DESTINA
. TION IS REACHED.
Haatiesburg, Nov. 1. The 200 or
more negroes who left this city last
week for points in the West, ostens
ibly to be employed in packing plants,
are finding their way back home.
Home-sickness possessed them be
fore they got far on their journey,
and a majority of them left their
western steerers when the train
pulled into Meridian.
It is estimated that not more than
10 per cent of the number who left
here reached their destination. They
are returning on foot, on freight
trains and any other way to get back.

mm INSTITUTES TO
U UNREST OF KEGRDES '
TO TEACH BETTER FARMING
METHODS AND WAYS TO
AVOID CROP FAILURE.
Agricultural College, Miss., Nov.
1. To encourage the negroes of
Mississippi to remain at their farm
work, rather than follow the lure of
soft jobs and good pay held out by
labor agents from other states, Di
rector E. R. Lloyd, of the co-operative
extension work of the Mississippi
A. & ' M. College and federal gov
ernment is planning a series of far
mers' institutes for negroes. By
teaching the negroes better farming
methods, and pointing out ways of
avoiding crop failures such as have
been experienced by some this year,
Professor Lloyd hopes to increase the
usefulness of the negroes to them
selves and to the state. Much good
has already been accomplished along
this line by the several negro county
agents who are working under the
direction of State Demonstration
Agent R. S. Wilson.
The. first of these institutes for
negroes will be held at Artesia, Miss.,
within the next few days, and Profes
sor Lloyd, State Agent Wilson, and
other extension workers-are sched
uled to speak to the negroes in that
section.
State Commissioner of Agriculture
P. P. Garner, and the federal govern-.
ment have approved this extension
service to the negro farm workers.
In making application to the commis
sioner of agriculture for a farmers'
institute for his people, W. B. Tucker,
negro school teacher of Artesia, sets
forth the following clear-cut reasons
for the negro exodus to the north,
and suggests a remedy:
"In view of the fact that large
numbers of our colored people are
leaving for the north and for other
sections of the country," he says, "we
who do not desire to do likewise rea
lize that some step should be taken
with a view of discouraging the exo-
lue. I feel that they are taking a
:;tep that they will ultimately regret.
True, many of them will stay away,
but many more will surely become
dissatisfied and return to their old
homes in the south only to find to
their sorrow that their services are
no longer required.
"The contributory causes of this
unusual negro exodus are many, the
most prominent of which; insofar as
the negro on the farm is concerned,
is his ignorance of up-to-date scien
tific methods of farming. Of the
numerous farmers' institutes and
lemonstration meetings held in our
country, but few have reached the
negro directly; the merits of crop di
versifications have failed to appeal
to him in an encouraging light, and
therefore, one complete failure of
the cotton and corn crops his only
hobby is sufficient to throw him
into a panic. On the slightest in
ducement due to exaggerated reports
of prosperity elsewhere he is rea!y
to pack up and move.
"Farmers' institutes for negroes
will go far toward calming the grow
ing unrest among the negroes in the
rural districts of our section of the
state. If Institutes of this kind are
held at convenient places in every
county of the black belt and such
subjects as diversification of crops,
economy on the farm, how to grow
cotton in spite of the boll weevil, and
lectures to the women on domestic
science be discussed by agricultural
experts, a great deal of good will be
done. In every case these lectures
should be supplemented by a speech
advising the negroes against emigra
tion to the north, by somefof the ne
gro leaders of the state in whom the
people have confidence. I feel that
such a campaign carried out at this
season of the year will accomplish
much."

Overcome with horror at the sight

NATION OF THE ARTIST'S
NAME FROM COIN.
Washington, Nov. 1. Treasury of
ficials are considering whether th
initials of the designer of the new
dime, put in circulation today for the
first time, shall be eliminated and
coinage suspended temporarily, as
was done in the case of the original
Lincoln penny.
On the face of the dime the ini
tials of the artist appear prominently
in monogram.
When the Lincoln cent-piece was
first coined it boe unobstrusively on
the base of the bust small initials of
the artist. The treasury department
ordered the letter off under its ruling
that no advertisement shall appear
on any coin.
The supply of the new dimes here
was 250,000, and a like number was
at the sub-treasury at New York.
There were 400,000 nt the sub-treas-
