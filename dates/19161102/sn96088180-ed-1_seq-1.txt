question will be the principal one If

over the deaths of six Americans on

While this government has main
tained the right of merchantmen to
arm for defense, Germany has never
admitted It. The question first arose
when the Liialtanla was sunk. This
government has insisted that mer
chantmen may arm with any guns
not over six Inches In calibre, When

Escort 'of Mexican Central
Railway Slain in Cold Bleed
While 400 Passengers Are
Robbed of Their Valcsiles
El Paso, Nov. 2. Twenty-eight de
facto soldiers, forming the escort of
a train on the Mexican Central rail
way line were butchered In cold
blood, 400 passengers were lined up
and rofbbed and a German subject
beaten senseless by two hundred Vil
li sta bandits at Lftgnna last Monday,
when the railroad line was cut by the
Villlstas.
Official announcement of this dis
aster was made here today by Consul
Soriano Bravo. 1
Tbe town ot iaxguna is about 150
miles straight south of the Americaa
border. An official bulletin, giving
meager details of the hatchery, reach
ed the border when the wires wen
re-opened today.
Bandit chiefs Murga and Quesedo,
allied with Villa and noted tor their
cruelty, were in command of the VU-
llsta detachment. .,,,.....
The train, .which left Jnares Mon
day, was heavily loaded with passen
gers. All were ordered from the
cars, lined up and robbed of their
valuables and In some caaea of their
clothing and shoes.
Dr. Haft ner, a German physician of
Chihuahua City, was returning from
El Paso to his home. One bandit
struck him over the head with a rile
butt, rendering him unconscious, ac
cording to advices received at the
Carransa consulate. Few other pas
sengers were harmed, It is believed,
unless they resisted.
The armed escort of 28 men from
the Juarez jarrlson waa taken otrt
In squads, stood beside the ears
and shot down before the eyes of the
terrlhed passengers. Their arms and.
ammunition were taken toy the ban-.
j tacitly admitted that the railway line
still Is severed at several points and.
Chihuahua City still Isolate.
The official bulletin continues:
"The main column of General May
cotte reached Ortls. about eighty
mile south ot Chihuahua City, yes
terday, on the way to Santa Rosalia.
San Buena Ventura and Namlqulpa
re-occupied by government troops.
Three bandits executed at Naml
qulpa." The location of the raid npon the
train near Laguna Is the farthest
point that Villlstas in any force have
penetrated since Villa was driven
south by General Pershing's forces
last spring And the nearest point to
tbe American expedition the bandits
have approached since Villa resumed
hi activities In Chihuahua state.
Laguna Is only -about 70 miles
southeast from El Valle, where the
outposts ot Pershing's expedition are
situated.
Since Villa's advance toward Chi
huahua City, It is said another toro
of American troops has been moved
nearer the Mexican railway.
