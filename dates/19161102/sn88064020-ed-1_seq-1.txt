the only explanation that they can
give is the fact that the clutch ran
hot and caused the ignition of the gas
oline in that way. Mr. Lafitte also
stated that he had had some trouble
with the carburator before starting
and some of the gasoline leaked out.

AND SHOES IN STREET
The chill wind from the river
skipped into Lavergne street before
dawn Saturday and tripped ticklishly
up and down the portions of Paul
Absolonson that should have been
covered by his trousers and shoes.
But Paul slept on-slept on the
hard Lavergne street sidewalk near
the point where the good ship Bur
stad. on which he is one of the most
popular firemen, was moored in the
Mississippi. s
Absolonson absolutely felt noth- ti
ing. n
The wind was chilly, but not chilly A
enough to neutralize the heat of all '
that good liquor that had defeated w
his efforts to return to the Burstad. w
Doorman George Keogh, hurrying B
along Lavergne street to the eighth 3
precinct police station, at 4:10 a. m. 8
stumbled over the sleeping Paul. Is
"Somebody must of took 'em." b
explained Paul. yawning, to the po- w
liceman. T
Paul finished his sleep aboard the h

BIDS OPIE[ND FOR
NEW SCHOOL BUILDIHl
Wily ('4t $20,240. Will Be IAi
cated lJut Oppisdte J ntrance
to Naval Station.
Bids for the construction of the
school building in the Naval Sta
tion section, were opened Tuesday
night by the Commission Council.
Among the six bidders was Mr. Jos.
W. Lennox, of our town, whose bid
was third in the list. The other bids
were as follows: Petty, $33,000;
Bob, $29,953; Jos. W. Lennox, $29.
300; Chesse. $29.458; Reiman. $27,
870 and Chisholm, $26,240. The
latter being the lowest bidder in the
bids for the other school, which bids
went higher than the appropriation.
There is a difference between the
highest and lowest bid of $6,760. In
the bids of the school which was to
be erected prior to this there was a
difference in bids between Mr. Len
nox and Mr. (Chisholm of an amount
less than $100. The difference in
bid, however, of this building is $3.
060. The contract no doubt will be
awarded to the lowest bidder within
a short time. The schools will be
begun at once as the money is avail
able for the purpose.
The building of the school in this
section means much for the people
living in this vicinity. Survey made
in this vicinity some time ago showed
that the school population amounted
to more than 400, which will be
enough to operate the school at its
capacity.
According to the plans and speci
fication, the new school will be one
of the latest models in school archi
tecture and will be up to the very
minute.
The building is so constructed
that additions may be made from
time to time as the necessity arises.
At the present time there will be
four very large school rooms, to
gether with a basement, and on the
rear of the building there will be a
large gallery running the entire
length of this school. The building
will be approximately one hundred
and forty feet long and will have
every convenience known in the con- -
struction of up-to-date schools. It
will be steam-heated throughout and
the plumbing will be of the very
highest nature.
UNDERGROUND WIRES FOR
TECHE AND OPELOUSAN.
According to the new lighting con
tract which the city made with the
New Orleans Railway & Lighting
Company the wires for lighting Al
glers on Teche street and Opelou
sas avenue are to be placed under
ground. This will certainly make a
great improvement along these two
paved streets and will add greatly to
the beauty of the section.
Just when this work will be be
gun has not been stated but the
contract has been awarded to the -
New Orleans Railway 1 Lighting
Company and no doubt they will
sublet the contract for our side of
the river, very likely to the Algiers
Railway & Lighting Company.
MAYOR BEHRNMAN TO
ADDRESS IMPORTANT BODIES
To Speak at Charieston.
Mayor Behrman has accepted the
invitation of the Chamber of Com
merce of Charleston, 8. C., to ad
dress that body upon terminals and
belt railroads. About a week ago
the mayor received a pressing invi
tation to go to Charleston and speak
on October 31. After considering
he decided to accept the invitation
and later learned that the coming
of the farm loan bank committee,
for its hearnig in New Orleans would
not permit his carrying out his in
tention, and was forced to wire his
regrets. The Charlestonians, how
ever, decided that, since the mayor
could not come for October 31, they
would postpone the date to suit the
mayor, and finally arranged for No
vember 16.
JOHN LAFITTIE' PLACE REMOD.
The big grocery store of John La
8ftte, Ltd., corner of Pelican avenue
and Seguin street, is now being com
pleted. The improvements here con
sisted of enormous areas of concrete
being laid together with such other
improvements as were required by
the Board of Health. The Lafitte
boys have always been recognised as
being up to date and keeping abreast
of the time.
MARTINEZ TO HAVE NEW PLACE
The residence and bakery of H.
Martines is being remodeled and
when completed will present a hand
some appearance. The entire lower
floor has been raised so that a new
first floor can be added. This work
is now going on and it Is expected
that it will be completed in about
thirty more days. Besides the hand
some new store there will also be
an up to date bakery attached and
other improvemente in keeping with
an up to date shop of this kind.
