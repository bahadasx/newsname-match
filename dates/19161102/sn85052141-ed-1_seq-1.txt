Around 20.000.000 happy tresldes the fathers or America 1U

Circles, where hunger crouches snd disease treads. If thU be t11

A movement on a wholesale
scale to pad registrations and
colonize voters in Indiana, Ohio
and Illinois is believed to be in
progress. - The Indiana investiga
tion concerns six cities in particu
lar. They are Indianapolis,
Kvansville, Munice, Greensburg,
Richmond and Gary. The frauds
uncovered concerned both
schemes for the wholesale colon
ization of negroes and the illegal
registration of voters that it is
said to run into the thousands.

Flour went to .$10.50 per bar
rel wholesale Monday, and some
of the local wholesale houses re
stricted sales to not over five
barrels to a customer. A repre
sentative of one of these houses
tells us that he will not be sur
prised if flour sells at $20 a bar
rel before another wheat crop is
grown in Fulton county.
FIRE MINOR IMPORTANCE.
The fire alarm, with West Hick
man signal, was turned in short
ly after noon Sunday, but the
blaze proved to be only the burn
ing of a pile of lumber on the
railroad right-of-way, near where
the old grain elevator was dis
mantled. The fire department
responded and stopied the fire,
as it endangered a lot of cotton
and other near-by property. A
passing train probably ignited
the dry grass, which in turn set
the lumber afire.
WHEAT $2 A BUSHEL.
No. 2 hard wheat sold on the
St. Louis Merchants' Exchange
Saturday for $2 a bushel, a new
high-record price since the Euro
pean war started and the highest
level reached since April 1877,
when it sold at $2.22.
; ,The highest price ever recorded
in the St. Louis market was in
April 1SG7, when No. 2 red wheat
sold for $3.85 a bushel.

The Mayfield ' fair ground
.tuildings were sold to the high
est bidder Saturday and they
will be torn down this week and
there will probably not be anoth
er fair unless a new grandstand,
stables, floral halls, etc., are
built. The lease has expired and
the owners of the land will man
age it in the future.
According to the Commercial
Appeal, Mrs. Bessie Glasscock
McNeil, now of Chicago, and well
known here, is seeking a divorce
from her husband, charging that
he stays out four and five nights
out of a week and has also slap-
Iod and mistreated her.- They
were married Jan. 25, 1913.
The Dodds cotton gin, which
has managed by working almost
night and day to handle their gin
ning with only the electrically
driven side of the gin, was forc
ed to fire up their steam engine
Saturday and operate the whole
equipment to full capacity to
take care of the business.

The Hughes-Roosevelt Way
What Roosevelt Would Do As Secretary of War and
Dictator to Hughes
"I have been asked what I would
have done if I had been President
when the Lucltania was torpedoed,'
shouted the speaker. ty would In
stantly have taken possession of
every German ship Interned In this
country, and then I would have said:
'Now, we will discuss, not what you
will give, but what we will give
back.'" Theodore- Roosevelt In a
speech at Battle Creek, October Z,
1916.
With Hughes as President, and
Roosevelt as Secretary of War,
we would today be taking part In
the European war and sacrificing
hundreds of thousands of our
fathers and sons and piling up
billions of dollars of debt, and
all to accomplish loss than WH
son got by diplomaoy.

HONOR SENATOR FEOST.
The Baptists of Graves county
so much appreciated the stand
of Senator Frost as State Sena
tor and as a Private citizen on
all great moral issues that th'ey
uid the unusual tiling ednesday
in session at Little Bethel church
by electing a layman moderator.
A minister has always held this
position, but the record has been
broken. Senator Frost was C-
lected and makes a splendid pre
siding officer. He now has the
hearty support of the five thous

'ORIGIN OP SPECIES."
The Republican elephant and
the Democratic donkey were both
originated by Thomas Nast in his
cartoons in Ilarper's" Weekly in
1874. Their conception grew out
of a hoax in the New York Her
ald to he effect thai the animals
of the Central Park menagerie
had broken and loose and were
wandering about the city. Soon
after Nast labelled the two politi
cal parties as well as the Tam
many tiger.
If any one is due the thanks
of their party in this end of Ful
ton county, we are sure they are
Judge Elvis Stahr, Judge B. T.
Davis, Judge F. S. Moore, City
Attorney ,T. R. Powell, Attys. W.
J. McMurry, M. B. Shaw and Dee
McNeil, the principal speakers
and workers in a persistent Dem
ocratic campaign which has been
waged in this end of the county
for the past two weeks. They
have spent both their time and
money preaching the gospel of
Democracy.

can be had for shipping.
A WORD ABOUT SAMBURG.
The little city of Samburg,
down on Reelfoot Lake, was well
represented by Hickman folks
Sunday, who were out motoring,
enjoying the balmy October days.
Among those from Hickman we
noticed Esq. A. M. Shaw and
party, W. M. Shaw and party,
Henry Sanger and wife, B. G
Hale and wife, B. G. Hale, Jr.
and wife, Dr. II. E. Prather and
wife, Richard Prather, Miss Het
tie Williams and mother, W. -E.
Lynch and wife, N. R. Holcombe,
Misses Frankye and Lite Reid,
Miss NewbiU, Mrs. Dee Reid, Miss
Homer Green, Miss Kate Hackett, i
A. Minitree, Mack Reid, Leslie
Hackefct, Wiley Tummins, J. C.
Sexton and wife, W. C. Speer and
wife and others whose names we .
failed to get. Samburg seems to
be forging right ahead, even if
the oil boom did die a natural
death. The boring for oil has
ceased and the machinery has all
been moved away. Residents of
that section seem to know little
or nothing of the results of the
drilling, except that the casing
has been pulled out and the ;
"hole plugged up with mud." If
oil was found, the matter is, a -secret.
Mrs. W. J. Logan, form
erly of this city, runs the princi
pal hotel of Samburg and is do
ing nicely with the business. The
jolly bunch that meets at Sam
burg for hunting, fishing and out
ing, find it an ideal spot for the
purpose, although this village was ;
once famed as the, cradle of
' ' Nightriderism. ' ' Even some of
the members of the once famous
organization Sam Applewhite
and others who were sentenced
to be hung uptil dead are there
to greet the visitors very much
alive and apparently the best of
fajlows. ; The little town, unique in
a way, is maintained by the fish
ing industry and enjoys a ; good
income as a sportsmans resort.
