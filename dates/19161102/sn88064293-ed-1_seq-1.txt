Complete Weather and Crop Report
ot Month Ending October 31st
Weather conditions in this section
during October, while not al
together so good during Septem
ber and August, continued favorable
to the Farmers. The five and one
half inches of rainfall which fell on
the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th of the
month, proved of great value in plac
ing the proper moisture in the
ground for fall planting, while the
dry spell preceding this rain was
broken, causing the cane to take on
renewed growth. The high winds on
the 16th and 17th proved of value
in shaking up the cane to the point
of taking on additional height and
size. The blow was not sufficiently
strong enough to do great damage.
During October there were 24
clear days, with four days on which
rain fell. The partly clouded days
numbered four, while during three
days no sun could be seen at all, ex
cept thru clouds.
The total precipitation for the
month reached 5.60 inches, with the
thermometer reaching its highest at
98 1-2 degrees Farhrenheit in the sun
The lowest record was 36 1-2 de
gress.
The first week in October started
the month off with very cool days
and nights, which served to assist in
maturing cane to the point of har
vest. The past few days of October
proved too warm for good results in
the cane fields.
The general weather conditions,
however, have not served to set-back
the 1916 crop, and the prospects now
for a bumper crop are as good as at
any time during the past five
months.
A safe estimate would place one
third of the 1917 crop already plant
ed, with generally favorable condi
tions surrounding the fall plant cane.
The ground is at present moist,
