Dated at Princeton, Minn.,
October 28, 1916.
F. C. Cater,
Carl Eckdall,
F. W. Thomas,
J. F. Warren,
County Commissioners of Mille
Lacs County, Minn.
Just as we expected and stated in
last week's issue of the Union, the
county commissioners pledge them
selves not to increase the tax levy to
meet either the principal or interest
on the seventy-five thousand dollars
issue of bonds if the same are voted
and issuedfor reasons best known
to himself Commissioner Grow re
fused to sign the above pledge, but
we take it for granted that he is not
in favor of increasing the tax levy.
S.o the question of an increase of the
tax levy for road and bridge purposes
is disposed of.
There will be no increase of the tax
levy for road and bridge purposes,
directly or indirectly, if the $75,000
bonds for road improvement are voted
and issued.
Now for the figures to prove that a
one mill tax will more than care for
the principal and interest.
Assuming that the bonds are voted
and issued the indebtedness created
would be $75,000 interest on that
amount at 4 per cent would be $3,000.
The present valuation of the county is
in round numbers $4,500,000 a one
mill tax on that amount would produce
$4,500, $1,500 more than would be
necessary to meet the interest on the
bonds. In five years the surplus pro
duced by a one-mill tax over and above
the amount required to meet the inter
est on the bonds would be $7,500, that
amount deducted from the principal of
$75,000 would leave a remainder of
$67,50.0 at the end of the five year
period, and that is assuming that the
valuation would remain stationary,
which is a violent assumption, as the
valuation would undoubtedly increase
year by year as the county settled up
and its resources were developed.
Then estimating a gradual increase
in the valuation of the county until at
the end of the twenty year period it
amounted to $7,000,000and that is a
very reasonable estimatethe princi
pal would be reduced annually and the
interest would be correspondingly de
creased, and, as we have repeatedly
stated, a one-mill tax would amply
care for the interest and principal,
until at the end of the twenty year
period the debt would be completely
wiped out.
Hence we unhesitatingly assert that
it would never be necessary to levy
more than a one-mill tax to meet the
interest and principal on the bonds.
To put the proposition in another
form. Under the present valuation,
$4,500,000, it would require a tax levy
of 16.7 mills to raise $75,000 in one
year. By letting the bonds run for
20 years, with the privilege of paying
them gradually after five years, a
tax levy of one mill annually would be
sufficient.
We believe it is good business policy
to have the bonds run for a series of
20 years. Then there would be no
perceptible increase in the road and
bridge taxesno increase over what
such taxes are at present.
There is another phase of the road
improvement proposition that should
not be overlooked: It is proposed to
expend $147,000$50,000 Federal aid,
$22,000 State and county, and $75,000

pal item of expense. That would
mean good wages and constant em
ployment for a large force of men and
teams in this county next year.
We wish the people of the county as
a whole would take a broad and com
prehensive view of this road improve
ment project. There is not a single
resident of the county but who will
say he is in favor of good roads. Good
roads cannot be obtained except by the
judicious expenditure of some money
under intelligent supervision.
We appeal to the thinking, intelli
gent voters of Mille Lacs county to
divest themselves of local prejudices,
to forget their personal likes and dis
likes, and work and vote for the com
mon good. As J. Adam Bede would
say, think in continents not in acre
lots.
Mille Lacs county is afforded a
splendid opportunity of securing a
good road system of hard-surfaced
highways at a comparatively small
cost to the taxpayers of the county,
a like opportunity may not offer again
for a generation.
Once more, and for the last time,
we will restate the proposition which
will be submitted to the voters next
Tuesday:
"Shall the bonds of Mille Lacs coun
ty be issued in the amount of $75,000
to run for twenty years at a rate of
interest not to exceed five per cent
per annum, the proceeds thereof to be
used for the purpose of permanently
improving and hard-surfacing State
Roads Nos. 1 to 6 inclusive in said
county?"
If you wish to vote for the proposi
tion place your cross-mark (X) oppo
site the square marked YES.
Democratic Speaker.
Hon. Niel Cronin, democratic can
didate for congress, addressed a small
but attentive audience at the Court
House hall Tuesday evening, being in
troduced by Mr. G. A. Eaton.
The speaker dwelt at length on the
achievements of the Wilson admin
istration and pledged himself to work
with the president if elected.
The good times are not due to the
war, said Mr. Cronin, but the com
mercial development of the United
States under President Wilson. Less
than ten percent of the steel manu
factured in this country is used for
war purposes, he said.
Mr. Cronin then said that every re
publican platform until 1916 had con
tained planks condemning the currency
laws of this country. This year the
platform is silent on this important
proposition, he said, for the reason
that the Wilson administration has
given the people of the United States
the wisest and best currency law in
the worldthe Federal reserve act.
Wall street cannot control the money
market and create a financial strin
gency so long as we have that law,
he said.
Mr. Cronin then denounced as in
consistent and hypocritical the severe
criticism being leveled at President
Wilson by the city papers. About a
year ago these papers were printing
editorials highly laudatory of the pres
ident, he said, and he read quotations
from the papers to prove it.
Mr. Cronin admitted that he had no
love for Carranza, but stated that on
the whole the president's Mexican
policy was right./
The speaker denounced Roosevelt
and others for their attacks upon the
peace policies of the president, and
praised the diplomatic achievements
of the administration.
It was an eloquent address, and at
the conclusion the speaker was given
a generous hand of applause.
Federal Aid Requirements.
Some gentlemen in Milaca labor un
der the hallucination that the Federal
road authorities will require impossi
bilities in road-building of counties
that receive Federal aid. Some time
since the Union published the Federal
road law full, but to set at rest
the fears of those who believe, or
rather pretend to believe, that it will
be impossible for thre county to com
ply with the Federal requirements we
quote from the Federal law:
From Sec. 6."That the Secretary
of Agriculture shall approve only such
projects as may be substantial in char
acter and the expenditure of funds
hereby authorized shall be applied only
to such improvements."
Also from Sec. 6."The construc
tion work and labor in each state shall
be done in accordance with its laws,
and under the direct supervision of
the State Highway department, sub
ject to the inspection and approval of

mmam
tions made pursuant to this act."
Is there anything difficult or exact
ing about these requirements? Are
not all of us familiar with the require
ments of our own State Highway Com
mission
Surely ,Milaca Will be Right.
It is rumored that there are busi
ness men in Milaca who are opposed
to voting bonds to meet the Federal
aid for road-improvement in this coun
ty. We do not believe it. Milaca's
business men are not so short-sighted.
The plans as contemplated would
give Milaca good roads in every direc
tionto the north, fo the south, to the
east and to the west.
Milaca is as much of a farmers'
town as Princeton is. Both towns owe
their prosperity to the farmers. There
is no way in which the business men
can help the farmers more than by
helping them to secure better roads.
What if a business man does con
tribute a few dollars in taxes towards
roads in the county. Indirectly he
gets back fifty dollars for every one
he pays for roads. And is it not a
fact that almost every business man
in Milaca and Princeton has an auto
mobile and rides over the country
roads, and one heavy automobile go
ing at a high rate of speed will do
more damage to a road than twen:y
heavily loaded farmers' wagons?
We hardly think the business men
of Milaca can afford to oppose rotd
improvement. If they do they rill
have cause to regret their action.
But we do not for a moment belfeve
that a majority of Milaca's progres
sive business men will take the liack
trail in the matter of road improve
ment.
We believe the business men of
Milaca and Princeton are not so blind
to their own best interests as to place
an obstacle in the path of road im
provement.
The more good roads we have the
more prosperous farmers we will have,
and prosperous farmers spells pros
perity for every man doing business
in Mille Lacs county.
Succumbs to Pneumonia.
Luzelle Maude Anna, the ten-year
old daughter of Mr. and Mrs.E.T. Eck
lund, passed away last Thursday after
a brief illness, at the home of her
grandmother,, Mrs. Mary EckTund, in
this village. The girl's parents reside
at Remer, and were not here when the
end came.
Funeral services were conducted
Sunday from the family residence by
Rev. Samuel Johnson. Interment was
in Oak Knoll cemetery.
Among those from out of town who
attended the funeral were the follow
ing: Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Ecklund of
Cambridge, Mrs. A. D. Ecklund of
Pine Brook, Miss Tilda Anderson of
Cambridge, and Misses Bertha and
Pearl Whitney of Minneapolis.
Luzelle was a bright little girl
possessed of a happy disposition, and
her sudden taking away is indeed sad.
The parents, three brothers and a sis
ter survive her.
The relatives take this means to ex
press their heartfelt thanks to all who
rendered sympathy and aid tp them
during their recent bereavement.
Mullen and Forbes Inspect Road.
That the State Highway Commis
sion is taking an active interest in
the proposed improvement of the road
between Zimmerman and Princeton
and Princeton and Mille Lacs lake,
and the obtaining of Federal aid there
for, was evidenced by the fact that
Chief Assistant State Highway En
gineer J. H. Mullen and District En
gineer C. A. Forbes were here from
St. Paul Sunday, and went over the
entire road, so as to be enabled to
make an intelligent report to the Sec
retary of Agriculture at Washington.
Messrs. Mullen and Forbes stopped
here a short time on their, return trip
late Sunday afternoon.
Action Postponed.
The county commissioners met in
special session Saturday for the pur
pose of considering applications of
those desirous of filling out the unex
pired term of the late County Superin
tendent Ewing. There were four ap
plications filed, viz: Mrs. Guy Ewing,
Miss Spencer of Milaca, Miss Margaret
I. King and Olaf Wasenius of Onamia.
Miss Spencer withdrew her applica
tion. The commissioners decided to
take no action in the matter until the
meeting of November 9.

Princeton Will be Benefited.
One of Princeton's prominent busi
ness men remarked to Judge Keith the
other day: "I am against the bonds
because the lower end of the county
will not be benefited!"
That business man entertains a
narrow as well as an erroneous view
of the bonding proposition. The, agree
ment is that $10,000 shall be expended
in the town of Greenbush. Greenbush,
we believe, is in the extreme south end
of the county, and Greenbush is cer
tainly tributary to Princeton. Any
thing that helps Greenbush must of
necessity help Princeton. Princeton,
we also believe, is in the south end of
the county. The improvement of the
main road running through the cen
ter of the county, will commence at
the north end of the village limits.
Is not at least half of the territory be
tween Milaca and Princeton tributary
to Princeton village?

Over $25,000 will be expended on

Greenbush Gets a Good Deal.
We have always taken a friendly in
terest in the town of Greenbush and
on more than one occasion have given
practical proof of our friendship for
that town. When the new system of
state roads was established three years
ago it was largely through our instru
mentality that State Road No. 5 was
designatedthe road running jiorth
from the Greenbush town house to
Foreston. When we secured an extra
$14,000 from the State Highway Com
mission three years ago and the county
commissioners left it to us to say
where it should be expended, $2,000 of
the amount went to Greenbush town,
and $6,000 was expended on the road
leading from Princeton to Greenbush.
If the bond proposition carries
Greenbush will receive $4,000 for State
Road No. 4 in that townthis is the
St. Cloud road,and $6,000 for State
Road No. 5tlje road through Freer
in that town. Greenbush will receive
$10,000 in all, which is several thous
and dollars more than it will ever be
called upon to pay on account of the
bonds. Besides Greenbush will have
about 11 miles of its main roads put
in good condition at once. It certainly
does seem as if there should be few
votes against the bonding proposition
in Greenbush, for no town in the
county will be better cared for if the
road improvement program goes
through.
If any resident of Greenbush doubts
our assertion that $10,000 is more than
"Greenbush will ever be called upon to
pay, let him take his pencil and figure
it out: The valuation of Greenbush at
the present time is $327,290 it would
require a rate of 16.7 mills to raise
$75,000 if it were to be all raised in
one year. If the valuation of the coun
ty remained as it is Greenbush would
be required to pay only $5,465 of the
principal. But while the valuation of
Greenbush will not be greatly in
creased in the future that of the newer
towns will be, hence, we say, Green
bush's share of the bonded indebted
ness would be correspondingly de
creased.
To make it plainer, and dealing in
round numbers, at the present time
Greenbush pays about one-fourteenth
of the county taxes because it has one
fourteenth of the valuation. But when
the time comes, as it soon will, when
the newer towns are more thickly set
tled and better developed, their valu
ation will be largely^ increased and
taxes arejsased on the valuation.
Remember This Next Tuesday.
The proposition to bond the county
for $75,000 for road-improvement, if
carried, will never require more than
a one-mill tax levy annually to meet
the principal and interest. By reduc
ing the tax levy for county road and
bridge purposes from three to two
mills, as our present board of county
commissioners have pledged them
selves to do, there will be no increase
in the tax levy to meet the interest
and principal on the bonds.
Remember, also, that if the bond
proposition carries we are assured of
$50,000 of Federal aid for road im
provement in this county.
And do not forget that a rigid su
pervision of the expenditure of money
for road improvement will be exer
cised by the State Highway Commis
sion and the Federal road authorities.
Successful Road Meetings.
E. L. McMillan and R. C. Dunn
addressed meetings at Wahkon on
Tuesday afternoon and at Bock in the
evening, and had attentive audiences
at both places. Mr. J. A. Allen of
Milaca also delivered a talk at Bock.
On Wednesday evening a well-attend
ed meeting was held in the Uglem
school house in Greenbush, which was
presided over by Mr. James Robert-
son.' Anyone who thinks Greenbush is
against road-improvement has another
think coming.
Tonight a meeting will be held in
the school house close by Louis Robi
deau's residence in Greenbush. On
Friday evening a meeting will be h.eld
in the Woodward Brook school house.
VOLUME XL. NO. 46
An afternoon meeting will be held in
Foreston on Saturday, and on Satur
day evening in the high school audi
torium at Milaca. There will be short
road talks at the Armory in Princeton
on Monday evening.
Laid At Rest.
Final services for the late Guy
Ewing were held at the Armory
on Saturday afternoon, and the
seating capacity of that building was
taxed to the limit to accommodate the
hundreds who gathered there to pay
a last tribute of respect to a worthy
citizen. All sections of Mille Lacs
county were represented, and the ad
joining counties were also well rep
resented.
Brief services were held at the fam
ily residence first, and the remains
were then escorted to the Armory by
members of the I. O. O. F. lodge of
which deceased was a member.
The floral tributes were exception
ally beautiful and numerous, and in
cluded wreathes from various lodges
as well as individuals. The casket
was literally embedded in flowers,
and the stage also contained wreathes.
A quartet composed of Messers. J.
W. Mossman and H. A. Garrison, Mrs.
Geo. Ross and Miss Ella Stearns sang
three appropriate selections, being ac
companied on the piano by Mrs. Benj.
Soule.
Rev. S. Johnson offered a prayer,
and Rev. Geer of the Methodist church
delivered the funeral sermon. It was
brief, but very fitting, and was de
livered in a sincere manner. A de
served tribute was paid the departed
one, whose entire life has been de
voted to educational work. Rev. Geer
emphasized the fact that the greatest
men of all periods have been teachers
of mankind, though the work has not
always been don| in schools. Service
to others was designated as the real
purpose in life. The sermon contained
thoughts that tended to modify the
grief of relatives and other friends,
and impressed all as a worthy effort.
At the conclusion of the sermon the
remains were followed to their last
resting place by a long procession, in
cluding Otidfellows and Masons. The
impressive Mason ritualistic cere
mony was carried out at the ceme
tery, H. J. Plaas reading the ritual
part, and at the conclusion-all that
was mortal of Guy Ewing was given
to mother earth.
Rebekah District Meeting.
A district meeting of the Rebekahs
was held at the I. O. O. F. hall here
yesterday afternoon, beginning at 2
o'clock, and about 45 Rebekahs were
in attendance from Milaca, Mora,
Hinckley and Onamia. Bemidj^was
also represented, and Mrs. R. W. Ra
dermacher, vice-president of the Re
bekah assembly, was also in atten
dance. The visitors were entertained
at dinner at the Merchants hotel by
the local lodge. During the meeting
degree staff work was carried out,
and the school of instruction proved
to be the best ever held at a meeting
here. The local Rebekahs worked
hard to make the affair a success, and
feel well repaid for their efforts.
Plenty of Counties Willing.
Federal aid for roads will be eagerly
sought for hereafter. At the meeting
of the State Highway Commission to
morrow there will probably be appli~
cations from almost every county in
the State. Mille Lacs county got in
on the ground floor several weeks ago,
when a promise of aid to the extent of
$50,000 was secured. If the people of
Mille Lacs county do not wish to ac
cept the aid that was so generously
promised there are plenty of other
counties that will only be too glad to
do so. Federal aid will not go beg
ging for takers. The only trouble will
be that there will not be enough to go
around.
Hon. Fred Stevens Coming.
The chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee positively
assures us that Hon. Fred Stevens,
one of the ablest and best representa
tives this state ever has had in the
United States congress, will address
the citizens of Princeton and vicinity
at the Armory next Monday evening
without fail. .Mr. Stevens is an elo
quent talker, one of the best in the
entire state. He will say something
worth hearing. It will be a great treat
to listen to a man of Mr. Steven's
ability.
A Listless Campaign.
Late fall work is largely responsible
for small crowds at the political gath
erings being held throughout the state.
The country people deem "prepared
ness" at home fully as escential as
"preparedness" at Washington, and
they are governing themselves accord
