PRIZE WINNERS.
Williamsburg Horses Capture
Awards at State Fair.
The people of Kingstree and Williamsburg
county at large have reason
to feel exceedingly gratified
V over the live stock that is owned
9 and being raised in the county, especially
the horses, for out of the
eight head sent from Kingstree to
the State fair at Columbia last week
five won prizes.
No mules, cattle, or hogs were
sent, but we feel sure there are
plenty of prize winners in this class
browsing about over the county if
they were on competitive exhibition.
Die prize winners among the car
of horses exhibited at the State fcir
from Williamsburg county were M
F Heller's stallion, "Black Print,"
which won first prize in the 3-heat
2:20 race?$127.50.
Mr Heller's "Wee Nee Boy" won
third place in the p ~ng race?time,
2:15?$30.00.
Miss Serena Lee's oh ?tland pony
won two first prizes, amounting to
$40.00.

while the colt, exhibited in its individual
class,carried off the first prize
of $20.00.
Mr F W Fairey's colt took the blue
j ribbon and first prize of $30.00 for
I the best South Carolina raised harness
horse.
These animals are now on exhibition
at the Pee Dee fair at Florence
and are more than apt to capture
some of the prizes offered by that
association. They will be on exhibition
at the WO.!;rtlnsburg county
fair here iKaC ween.
Since tne above was put in type
we karn that Mr Fairey's colt has
taken two prizes at the Pee Dee fair
,in Florence. First prize for the
best driving horse, contest open to
the world, and first prize for best
South Carolina raised harness horse.
Hon R H Kellahan, who is in a

getting along as well as his physicians

Kellahan underwent a serious opera|

WORD OF WARNING
TO DEMOCRATS.
nrwiDE OF RI-FASEITES' AT
TEMPTS TO ELECT HIM OVER
GOVERNOR MANNING.
To the Democrats of South Carolina:
My attention has been called to
the fact that tickets for the general
election are being distributed to voters
in the counties with the name of
Cole L Blease printed thereon in
place of R I Manning, the regular
nominee of the Democratic party for
Governor of this State. In a speech
before a convention of his friends in
Columbia October 24, the defeated
candidate in the primary stated that
! neither he nor his friends were bound
by the result of the late primary
election in which he was a candidate.
This man filed a pledge to support
the nominees, State and national, of
the Democratic party, and when he
voted took an oath to abide the re
suit of the primary election ana 10
support the nominees thereof. When
the State committee met to tabulate
the returns and declare the result,
not a protest or contest written or
verbal was made on behalf of any
candidate.
This flimsy pretense of fraud withI
out offering evidence thereof to the
committee or to the courts of the
State is simply an excuse to make a
cowardly and covert attack on the
regular nominees of the party. These
ballots that are being distributed
will be voted by some or they would
not be handled in the various coun
ties of the State. There are between
12,000 and 15,000 negroes registered.
Unless the believers in a white
man's government go to the polls
and vote the regular ticket election
day there is danger of its defeat or
at least humiliation. I deem it mv
duty as State chairman of the Dem-1
ocratic party to sound this note m\
alarm and call upon all white men
who remember the dark days of
Radical misrule not to be caught
sleeping on guard while these enemies
of our civilization are assassinating
the nominees of the party.
Our people have trusted white
men to be true so long that they are
hard to make believe that one could
violate his sacred pledge or oath,but
i^is frankly admitted Dy some mat
they intend doing it and we must
meet it like men. If candidates before
the primary and voters thereat

I bound by a solemn oath to support
| the nominees can violate their soliemn
oath? because they believe that
j improper means have been employ;
ed, without resorting to the party
I machinery or the State courts to
' correct the supposed wrongs, then
! every man is his own judge and jury
and his only restraint is his own con!
science. Can we affcrd to countenance
such conduct as this? If so,
J then indeed our primary laws are
; not worth the paper they are printed
upon and the safeguards of white
' supremacy are mere shadows. Not J
; only is our State ticket menaced but
, there are three sets of presidential
! electors in the field and the defeated
candidate openly states that he will
not assist in electing Woodrow Wilson,
the Democratic nominee for
President. Could a more open bolter
be wanted than this? Our nominees
for State offices are all .good and
true white men with honorable rec- i
ords. Our nominee for President has i
done more for the country at large
and the South in particular than any'
President since the War between the
States. Their characters are unimpeached.
Rally then to their support.
Don't go to sleep while the perjurer
votes. Be vigilant and see that every
vote is cast and counted, this is
your only safeguard.
John Gary Evans,
South Carolina Chairman, Democratic
Party.
