AMERICANS ABOARD
TORPEDOED SHIPS
CAROLINIANS ABOARD MARINA
AND ROWANMORE SUNK BY
GERMAN SUBMARINE.
GRAVEST SINCETHE SUSSEX
8tate Department Will Not Form an
Opinion Until Complete Official Reports
are Received?Seventy of the
Crew of 104 Are Reported Missing.
Washington.?Preliminary reports
of the sinking by German submarines
of the British steamers Marina and
Rowanmore, partly manned by Americans,
Including four Carolinians, wcro
too Incomplete to enable officials at
the state department to form an opin
ion as to whether there had been a violation
of neutral rights or of pledges
given the United States by Germany.
The Carolinians reported aboard the
Marina were J. G. Ralrd, Jr.. of Charlotte;
Geo. F. 9edberry, Fayetteville.
N. C.; F. C. Davis, of Wake Forest,
N .C? and Thomas J. Brannigan, of
Charleston, S. C.
Secretary Lansing declined to comment
further than to admit that he
reports appeared more serious than
the usual routine dispatches announe,
Ing the destruction of belligerent merchantmen
and that full Information
would be awaited with interest.
In its face, the case of the Marina,
reported hy Consul Frost at Queentown,
presents the gravest situation
that has arisen since the sinking of
O.. Vl-U
W1V- > linillim lillDI OUMWl, WHICH
brought the American and German
governments to the verge of a break.
Although he cautioned that his Information
was purely "provisional," the
consul cabled that tho Marina, a
"horse transport with a mixed crew
of British and Americans," was reported
sunk without warning by Germans
west of Capo Clear, and that 70
of the crew of 104 were missing.
Another message from Mr. Frost
said members of tho crew of the Kowanmore,
including Americans, had
been shelled In their boats while abandoning
the ship after being chased by
a submarine for 50 minutes. There
w, were no casualties.
According to tho Newport News
agents of the Marina's owners, the
Donaldson Line, the vessel, with some
BO American horse herders aboard,
was not under charter to the British
government as a transport, but was
engaged in her regular trade as a
freighter and carried horses for the
Allies as part of her general cargo.
Under such circumstances she would
be entitled to all the immunities of
any other belligerent-owned merchantman
and an enemy destroying her and
her contraband cargo would be required
to make due provision for safety
of the ship's company unless she was
sunk in act of attempting to escape.

the Somme region of France, there is
little If any change La the situation in

The Rumanians and Russians in

Washington.?What promised to be
a new source of serious friction between
the United States and the de

was cleared away through formal
; repudiation by Ellseo Arredondo, Mex!
iran Ambassador designate, of a statoment
issued here under the name of
j Luis Cabrera, assailing the American
' government for permitting aid tio
I reach Villa and other bandits from
I its side of the border.
Mr. Arredondo went to the state
department with the explanation that
the statement was put out by an employe

RUMANIANS BLOW UP BIG

London.?Except for the announcement
that the Rumanians before their
retreat from Tchernavoda hlew up
the big bridge spanning the Danube
River, thereby placing an obstacle in
the way of the advance of the Teutonic
Allies from Dobrudia into old
Rumania, little fresh knowledge of the
real situation In that sector of the
war has been vouchsafed by any of
the war chancellories.
Petrograd asserts the force of the
violent blows which Field Marshal
von Mackensen had been delivered in
his rapid drive northward in Dobrudja
has slackened somewhat although
Berlin says the Teutonic Allies still
are making progress against the Rumanians
and Russians.
Along the Transylvania front the
Rumanians and Austro-Qermans are
still engaged in hard fighting. Berlin
reports that in the Trotus Valley,
south of Paroltuz and on the roads to
Sinaya and Campulung, the Central
Powers have met with further successes.
On the other hand. Bucharest
asserts that the Austro-Germana
hahve been driven from the entire
western front of Moldavia, northern
Rumania, suffering? heavy casualties
and that in the Uzul and Oltuz Valleys
the Rumanians arms also have
been successful.

amounted to a breach of neutrality
were made in the House of Lords by
Raron Reresford and Raron Sydenham.
Lord Reresford is recognized as the

of Lords and Lord Sydenham's varied
activities has Included tho authorship
of hooks on naval affairs. Similar !
opinions have been expressed by '
some of the newspapers and public ;

San Antonio, Texas.?Porsistent reports
of the fall of Chihuahua City to '
the Villa forces, which have been current
here, have not been confirmed in
advices to Southern department headquarters
of the United States Army.
Major General Funston, questioned
regardin gthe reports, said that so
far as he knew they were not true.
Washington.?Mexican Consul Gardia
at El Paso, Texas, telegraphed the
Mexican Embassy hero that he had
been advised by Genoral Trevlno of
the arrival at Chihuahua of troop I
trains bringing about S.000 men under
General Maycotte to reinforce the garrison.
An earlier message from the Consul
said he had just received information
from General Trevino denying that he
intended to evacuate Chihuahua and
declaring ho did not fea ran attack.
Chihuahua City, Mexico.?Skirmishing
between General Garlos Ozuna's
advanced forces and those of Francisco
Villa continued, although the general
engagement is being delayed by
General Trevino until all of his troops
have been placed in stategic positions
in Western Chihuahua.
The excitement caused by the approach
of the Villa forces has been

General Trevino authorized the As- 1
sociated Press to make an official de- 1
nlal of the rumors that he was prepar- 1
ing to evacuate the city. He character- i
ized these rumors as "malicious inven- <

General Trevino stated that the sit- |

City was entirely satisfactory.
"Any fear that Chihuahua City will

he said.

While all of the tenders show the <

In Columbia.
Columbia.?At an informal confer- I
ence of newspaper editors and publish- \
era held in Columbia, it was decided ;
to call a meeting of the South Carolina S
Press Association at which the shortage
of news print paper will be considered.
The meeting will be held
November 10 at 2 p. m., the place of
meeting to be announced. The situation
concerning news print paper is ' j
considered serious by the editors of
the state and steps may be taken looking
to relief.
A committee was appointed at the 1
conference to confer with officials of
the Coker paper mills at Hartsville '
and J. E. Kocher, veneer manufacturer
of Columbia, to see if either might
offer relief It was brought out that ^
a paper famine is expected. H. J. Mc- j
Laurin of Sumter has been invited to s
appear before the association and out- |
line his plans for the establishment of ,
a paper mill in South Carolina. A mill .
was recently opened in the state of i
Louisiana. ,
O. K. Williams of Rock Hill, J. L. ,
Mims of Edgefield and W. J. Erwln t
of Chester were named as members t
of a committee to prepare a state- ! f
raent as to conditions. The price of <
paper has greatly increased in cost t
and it was brought out that manufactu- t
rers are declining contracts from sub- j
stantial customers. t
The editors gave consideration to t
tho organization of a co-operative pa- t
per manufacturing company to supply ,
tho papers of the state. The plant j
would cost about $70,000. it was esti- ,
mated and this amount, the proponents
say, would bo saved in two -
year?. f
It. C. Wright of Columbia told of |
his investigation into the paper situa- i
tion. He said that the paper mills are j
unable to fill their orders. s
It is probable that it will be necessary
to increase the subscription t
rates of the county papers. A. B. Jor- ,
dan. editor of the Dillon Herald, in a i
letter to the conference stated that it i
would be necessary for him to in- i
crease the price of his paper from $1 i
to $1.50 a year. It may also be neccs- ?
eary to increase the advertising rates, t
