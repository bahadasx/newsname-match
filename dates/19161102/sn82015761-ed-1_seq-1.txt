Williams November 4.
Flagstaff-Orpheum Theater
November 6.
In seeking reelection for the off.
ice of county superintendent of
schools, Miss Lenore Francis goes
before the voters with a record hard
to excel.
During her first term in office,
three new school districts have
been organized and schools estah
lished to meet the need of the
growing population.
She has tried to raise the stand
ard ft the schools and put rural
school education on a basis with
city schools.
Three new buildings have been
erected and a fourth is in course of
construction. All plans used have
been endorsed highly by Mr. C. O.
Case, state superintendent of pub
lic instruction.. Better lighting,
ventilation, -and sanitation have
been the principal features.
School supplies have been pur
chased by competitive bid system
at less expense to the boards.
State Examiner Dave Johnson
sent in a splendid report on the
records of the office, cost of, supervis
ion, and saving in district expense.
All vouchers have been carefully
itemized and O. K.'d by the state.
Mr. Davis, deputy examiner for
Mr. Case, stated that Miss Francis'
records are the beet kept and most
efficient in the slate.
The rural school specialist, Mrs.
Cook," sent 'out by the . United
States 'Department of Education,
made a special mention of the" in
stallation of Smith heaters in rural
schools. She claims these to be
less r.expensive,' less -complicated,
and to give entire satisfaction. -
' If all office . holders would per
form their duty as splendidly as
Miss Francis has, no one could
make any complaint. ;

Free Dance After Rally
The democrats will give a 'free
dance after the rally at Williams,
Nov. 4..
Believing his duties at the cap
itol to be of paramount import
ance, Chief Justice Henery D.
Ross has declined an invitation
to accompany the democratic
state candidates on their cam
paign tour and has elected to re
main in Phoenix "on the job.i'
Asked recently to give his rea
sons why he does not wish to act
ively enter the campaign, Judge
Ross issued the following state
ment: "I am not going to make a
campaign for two reasons for
the office of judge of the supreme
court:
First My time is not my own.
It belongs to the people. I am
their servant and as long as their
business demands my attention I
cannot, and do my duty, take it
myself or use it for any othsr
purpose, lhere are cases pend
ing in the supreme court ready
for argument and submission.
"It is more important to pri
vate litigants and the public that
these cases be taken up and de
cided, than that I should be run
ning around over the state shak
ing hands and making political
speeches in the interest of my re-
e!ection.':
The judges duties are, person
al. He cannot act through de
puties or agents as executive and
ministerial orhcersmay. No one
can act for the judge.. .Therefore
if he is npt .on the' job the public
interest" must, be neglected,
From "now until election I shall
be at iny- office discharging its
duties to the best of my ability.
Second Since statehood, un
til now, no candidate for judge
of the supreme court has actively
participated in pre-election .cam
paigns. . The republican and
democratic candidates . .have uni
haye uniformly refused to cam
paign with their party associates,
ana tms without any previous
understanding but out of a sence
of propriety of keeping the judi-
iary out of political controversy,
, oucn high, class lawyers as
Judge Kent, Judge Doe, Thomas
Armstrong and Walter Bennitt
have been honored by the repub
lican party as its nominees and
none of them ever actively par-
ticpated in the party campaigns.
l naa nopea tms settled out un
written law would continue the
rule in Arizona and so far as I
am concerned it shall be obser
ved. To the-extent that it lies
in my power, I am ready, willing
and anxious to keep the election
of our judges out of politics."

Third Chairman ' Charles R.'
Howe of the State Tax Commis
sion made the statement that
only one county had collected a
larger per cent of taxes for the

The office is an important one,
and one which requires a know
