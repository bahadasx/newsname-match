Pender Republic: Attorney R. E.
Evans was here the past week in
attendance at the session of the dis
trict court.
ffl Your interests have been imperilled because you have not been consulted.
M Congress put through the Adamson railroad law under pressure of the
U President. That law is not even an 8-hour law it is simply a law in
creasing wages of trainmen, who threatened a strike if they didn't get an in
crease. It merely provides that ten hours' pay shall be given for eight hours
work, thus increasing the pay of engine and trainmen -5 per cent. Under a
U. S. statute now in force these engine and trainmen may work iO hours a
day. Thus, an engineer getting Foe an hour will receive under the Adamson
law S16.00 for a dav of 16 hours, where now 'he gets but $12.80.
The railroads fuv this increase in wages will amount to $100,000,000 per
year; the railway un'.s iusist that the increase will be but $00,000,000
per year.
flTf But this is not all. The engine and trainmen are but 20 per cent of the
U railroad employees, and nuw'the o;her 80 ; ?r cniare preparing to demand
equal treatment.
TT President Wilson has said that this in" -- in wages, if necessary, shall
ll be taken care of by an increase in freigi.t rates, and. of course, an increase
in freight rates will be necessary. In fact, the Adamson law not only pur
poses to reimburse the railroads in this manner, but the railroads can he de
pended upon to get more.
tfjf Nebraska is in the middle of the continent and no State has a longer haul
ol to the Atlantic or the Pacific; therefore is it not evident that this bill is of
vital importance to every farmer and consumer in Nebraska, as these, and not
the railroads, arc the ow who aiv to pay the cost? For years Nebraska farm
ers fought for lower freight rati :.iul succeeded. Now we are going back to
the eld ways, with a project that rates will be higher than ever before in the
history of the State.
tfjT" Farmers and consu:"ors of Nebraska, you remember how you have strug-
jl gled to get the rates you are entitled to. Are you going to submit to this
new imposition this action of the President and Congress to undo your work
of years? ,

Judge Fawcett the Man
Judge Jacob Fawcett bf the su
premo court is a candidate for elec
tion as its chief justice. Judge
Fawcett is regarded by the Nebras
ka bar a3 a man of the highest in
tegrity and one of the most able
jurists who ever served on tho high
bench of Nebraska. Judge Fawcett
is distinctly a self-inade nian, having
worked his own way to a legal edu
cation. His exceptional talents were
soon recognized at tho bar, resulting
in his election as a district judge of
the Omaha district, later confirmed
by re-election, making a continnous
sorvico'of eight years. Judge Faw
cett was appointed to the supremo
bench in December, 1908, was elect
ed to a full term in 1909, which he is
just completing, and is a candidate
now for election as chief justice on
a non-partisan ballot. No ihigher
compliment can be paid Judge Faw
cett than to restate a truth univer
sally known to the legal profession
of the state: That ho is everywhere
regarded as fearless, unbiased and
capable in the highest degroe. His
election as chief justice will be both
a warrant and a guarantee that tho
work of the court will be expedited
to the fullest degree consistent with
careful and scholarly consideration
of the issues presented. Judge
Fawcctt's record on the bench fully
bears out this well-earned reputation.
