Commercial Club Hears Fav
orable Reports From Ru
ral School Meetings.
OPPOSERS ARE FEW
Explanation of Ballot Is
Urged Mass Meeting to
Be Saturday.
Farmers and townsmen agreed in
predicting an overwhelming vote to
retain the Columbia Special Road Dis
trict next Tuesday. Today was Farm
ers' Day at the Commercial Club
luncheon at the Virginia Grill, and
representathes from various parts of
the district were called upon to give
their opinion of the sentiment on the
road question. E. Sidney Stephens,
chairman of the committee to oppose
abolition of the district, presided.
P. M. Pace, who had charge of the
meeting at the Carlisle Schoolhouse
Tuesday, thinks it would be a step
backward to go against the district
now. "I have not louna one man
against retaining it." he said. "We
can't hate good roads if we divide up
into little districts."
P. II. Murry reported on the senti
ment expressed by the men who met
at the Bank Schoolhouse. "I don't
think there is a single vote against it
there," he said.
Luther Hickam said that there was
only a small crowd out at the meet
ing at Bethel Schoolhouse, but that if
there is a vote against the proposition
there he does not know of It.
To "Kickers" Are Reported.
J. L. Dodd reported that there were
two "kickers" at the Vawter School-
house meeting who were not satisfied
with the way the money was spent.
"I don't think more than two would
be against the district, if they would,"
he concluded.
Browns had previously reported
that only one out of twenty-six at the
meeting favored tho petition to do
away with the district.
W. M. McMickle said that the senti
ment at the Strawn Schoolhouse was
in favor of continuance, and that there
would probably not be one vote
against it
"I have not talked to one man
against continuing it," Joe Hickam of
Zaring Schoolhouse district told those
present "Our commissioners are do
ing well in keeping the roads in re
pair." Robert Turner reported everyone in
faor of continuing the district near
Bryson Schoolhouse.
W. D. Powell, of McBaine, said, "We
feel that the Columbia district is the
mother of ours. We have done some
cry good work, but have not done
so well as you have. Very few men
there favor doing away with Colum
bia's district."
Says 93 Per cent Are Favorable.
R. L. Hill and E. C. Anderson were
asked to give the sentiment of Colum
bians. Sir. Hill estimated that 95 per
cent of the votes cast would be for
continuing the district. Mr. Ander
son warned those who favored it
against overconfidence.
J. W. Schwabe declared that Co
lumbia has the best road district, in
the state because it has a gang con
structing roads and another repairing
them. "Town and country are to
gether on propositions that interest
both," he said. "This town belongs to
the farmers just as much as it be
longs to us. The books are open to
any citizen in the district to come in
and examine," he said further. Mr.
Schwabe predicted that there would
not be 300 votes against retaining the
district
Mr. Stephens asked everyone pres
ent to explain the proposition to all
voters. It is his opinion that there
will be little opposition if every voter
understands what he is voting on. He
announced the mass meeting at the
courthouse at 1:30 p. m. Saturday and
asked that all who were in favor of
the petition be present

French Now Have Possession
of Last Verdun Defense
Held by Teutons.
By United Prej.8
BERLIN, Nov. 2. Fort Vaux, on the
northeastern front of Verdun, has
been evacuated by the German troops,
it was officially announced this aft
ernoon. "The artillery engagements on the
eastern bank of the Meuse increased
to great intensity," said the. war of
fice. "The French directed an es
pecially heavy destructive fire against
Fort Vaux, which had already been
evacuated during the night by our
troops, after a given order and with
out being disturbed by the enemy. Im
portant parts of the fort were blasted
by us before withdrawal."
Fort Vaux was the last of the Ver
dun forts remaining in the hands of
the Teutons, Fort Douaumont having
been recaptured by the French in
their recent offensive. United Press
dispatches from the Verdun front
Saturday night declared that Fort
Vaux was surrounded on three sides
by the French, whose artillery was
ringing the forest with fire, cutting
off supplies to the Germans. Vaux
was captured by the Germans June
6 after a terrific battle. It occupies
a strong position on the summit of a
hill, and the French had repeatedly
repulsed storming attacks up its
steep sides. Its evacuation by the
Germans came on the 252d day of the
great struggle at Verdun.
By United Prcs
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. Reopening
of the entire armed merchantman con
troversy between this Government and
Germany is certain if it is proved the
British steamer Marina was armed at
the time she was sunk by a German
submarine, statements of Secretary
Lansing indicated this afternoon.
Whether merchantmen have a right
to arm for defense is still an open
question between this Government and
Germany, the secretary admitted. This
question will be the principal one if
negotiations develop with Germany
over the death of six Americans o1
board the Marina, it was stated.
While this Government has main
tained the right of merchantmen to
arm for defense, Germany has never
admitted it. The question first arose
when the Lusitania was sunk. The
United States has insisted that mer
chantmen may arm with anyvguns
not more than six inches in caliber.
When discussion of this point arose
during the Lusitania negotiations the i
State Department showed that the
Lusitania was unarmed.
Without a recession by the United
States from its position or an admis
sion by Germany that merchantmen
migni arm, tne question was per
mitted to lapse.
Secretary Lansing said the right of
merchantmen to arm is still a mooted
question, there has been no decision
on it. Germany is expected to main
tain that armed merchantmen were
not included in her pledges to the
United States.

"After inspecting the bridge we
found that the tie-rods should be
tightened," said Prof. 0. D. Kellogg,
member of the city council. "One of
the supporting timbers is out of line
so. that the floor of the bridge at the
west approach sinks perceptibly under
the weight of passing vehicles. -This

between the support and bridge floor.

AMENDMENT CONFUSES VOTERS
Many Persons Think Clause Is for
Suffrage, Not Prohibition.
Mrs. C. P. Algeo, chairman of the

amendment, thinking it is a suffrage
clause instead of a state-wide prohi
bition amendment "We are desirous
of overcoming this error," she says,

and vote 'yes' on this amendment"

NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 2.
Smiling Captain Koenig, skipper of
tne German submarine freighter
Deutschland; thought today he would
be able to unload his $10,000,000 cargo
without interference from the United
States. He claimed there was no
hitch about this, but Collector of "the
Port McGoven evidently thought dif
ferent, for he hastened to Hartford
to confer with Secretary of the
Treasury McAdoo,' presumably about
the known jewels and the stocks and
bonds said to be aboard.
Sleepy New London Is wider awake
now than it has been since the day
the British sneaked up the channel,
captured the fort and, slew the brave
American commander.
Captain Koenig and his crew are
cheered every time they appear on
the streets. The 16-year-old member
of the crew, with several sturdy fel
low members, had to fight their way
out of an admiring crowd of women
when they appeared on the streets
today. They hedged out only after
they had signed photographs of their
boat.

Showing the Condition of the Flooring on the Stewart Road Bridge.
"The floor Is also badly in need of
repair but the council does not feel
that-theyijoaa spend seven cr eight
hundred dollars for a new floor, at this
time. It is my opinion that the bridge
is not dangerous but merely needs a
thorough overhauling."
Mayor J. M. Batterton acknowledges
the need of a new bridge but says
that the present structure can be
made to serve until the city adminis
tration can see its way clear to invest
money in a new project.
"Of course we ought to have a new
and artistic structure as a gate-way
to Westmount, but I do not feel that
we can put another bond issue up to
the voters at present," he said. "After
the recent school bond issue I feel
that we should not ask for more
bonds immediately.
Approaches Being Strengthened.
"I think that we can repair the old
bridge and make it do until the time
comes when we will be able to build
a handsome structure. We have al

wooden approaches and for fifty feet

A fire of unknown origin partly de
stroyed the home of the Rev. A. V.
Bayley, 409 South Fifth street about
2:30 o'clock this afternoon, burning
the roof and part of the second floor
and damaging a vacant house of Har
vey Coons next door. Practically all
of the furniture except that in one
room was safely removed and the loss
is covered by insurance. The house is
owned by M. E. Hays, former Univer
sity student and now teaching at Tex
as University.
The Reverend Bayley did not know
or the fire until practically all of the
roof had been destroyed. He was sit
ting in the house reading when W.
L. Blenden, a studentin the University
who was attending class in the Man
ual Arts Building, saw the flames and
spread the alarm. Mr. Blenden and
other students were on the scene and
had already removed a large part of
the furniture before the fire depart
ment arrived.
When the fire department came the
fire had already spread to the Coons
house next door, but the firemen
quickly extinguished both blazes and
safely removed the rest of the furni
ture except a few pieces in one room
on the second floor of the Bayley
home.
Mrs. Carrie Bennett and her son
and Miss Alice Sutherland, all stu
dents in the University, room at the
Bayley home. They were not at home
at the time of the fire.
"I do not know how the fire start
ed," said the Reverend Bayley, "but I
think, a defective .flue may have caus
ed it "It is the first-time we have had '
a fire in sixty years. The water pres
sure was much better than usual and
the firemen did excellent work in put
ting out the blaze so quickly. The
house is Insured, but I don't know for
how much."
New Alley Back of Hall Theater.
A concrete alley is being built be
tween the Hall Theater and the Gor
don Hotel Building, extending from
Cherry street back as far as the Hud
son Garage. P. w. Niedermeyer and
Tom C. Hall, owner of the Hall The
ater and the adjoining lot on Ninth
street, are making the improvement
over the railroad tracks. This will
eliminate the wooden sections of the
bridge which are giving us all the
trouble. We are urging all contrac
tors to dump the dirt from building
excavations under the bridge. We have
cut trap doors in the floor for that pur
pose."
John Silver, acting city engineer, de
clares there is no need of apprehen
sion because of tho-noise caused by
vehicles passing over the structure.
"A light bridge of this type is bound
to make considerable noise," he said.
"This, however, is not an indication
that it is unsafe. The tie-rods will
knock together and the vibration will
spread to all parts of the structure.
Perhaps there are a few bolts and

gravel and north of Columbia looking
over possible locations. These trips
of inspection will be made until No
vember 10, when the committee is to
report back to a meeting of the or
ganizers of the temporary club.
"We' are eager to have more offers
of sites presented to us," L. M. Defoe
said today. "Several have been of
fered but I am sure that there are a
number of persons owning desirable
land near Columbia who would be
glad to sell or lease it to a country
club. These persons should com
municate with me as soon as possible
so that the committee may inspect
and pass upon the site before making
its recommendation." -
TO RAISE LAUNDRY PRICES
The Colombia Branches To Charge
3 Cents for Collars.
The laundries in Columbia will
raise the prices on the laundering of
collars November C from two and half
cents apiece to three cents apiece.
"Because of the increase in the cost
of supplies such as soap,' bluing
which has gone from $4 a pound to
$25 a pound paper boxes, twine and
the Increase in salaries, it is neces
sary that all laundries increase their
prices," says J. S. Milburn of one of
the, laundries. "The increase has
been applied to collars because they
constitute the greatest part of the
business and as the bundles are usual
ly small, the increase would not be
noticed so much. As far as we can
tell now, there will not be an increase
on any other laundry work."
The Increase has been applied to
collars because a good many persons,
both town and students, send their
laundry, with the exception of collars,
out of town," says C. C. McCulIough,
manager of another laundry.
