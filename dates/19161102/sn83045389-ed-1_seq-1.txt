In his afternoon spec*'-l? here. Presi
dent Wilson said, in part:
^ "It is exceedingly important that this
country should discuss its aftaiis with
as little partisanship of feeling as
possible, because its affair.-: woro never
>;o critically set about. I may >-u
exprosa it. as they are at this moment.
There was never a time when the de
termination of our domestic, questions
bore a more direct relation to other
countries. There never was a time
\ when the discussion of our own af
'* fairs needed to be more honestly, more
T thoroughly, more calmly conducted
\ than now. There is excitement enough
tn tho world. There in unrestrained
f impulBe enough, there is covetousness
of power enough. America has, so to
say. given promise to the world ilia'
she will look at things- without the
passion that has determined the ai
falrs of other nations."

f President continued:
"L?et me make nn allusion which
may seem like a political allusion, but
it la not so intended. The reason that
the Progres- ive party was formed four
years ago was that the large body of
men who formed that party made up
L tholr minds that the party they wei.
separating themselves from had not
thought out the questions of soiial
Justice. Is that not. hoV The program
of that new party, aside from the items
that you would expect In all programs,
was a program of social justice, and
look what happened. More than 4.000.
000 men Joined its ranks at the polls.
l[ not all of them, of course, I dare s.i>.
y nien who had thought the matter out.
W but all of them who felt that impulse,
w There are things that we ought to
i?ee to that we have not been seeing
to?the health, the moral opportunity,
the Juat treatment, the neighborly re
lationships of men of all sorts ami
conditions. I tell you. my fellow
ultleena, until a political party or any
other group of men get that thought
at their hearts, they are unfit for the
national confidence."
The President alluded to what he
termed the need "to organism the re

tive and governmental action."
