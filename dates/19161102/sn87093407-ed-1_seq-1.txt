BARES UTILITY
SCHEME TO GET
$5 DEPOSITS
Privately owned utility inter
eits are trying to saddle a to
deposit charge on all light and
power customers, by havina the
state public service commission
make a new ruling, Assistant
Corporation Counsel Walter F.
Meier said Thursday.
The city will fight the plan.
It would take $5 cash, in deposit,
from everyone who is connected up
for light and power in the state.
Meier returned Thursday after at
tending the conference between
utility representatives and the pub
lic service commissioners for one
day.
Hp contended that ownership of
premises or the signature of a guar
antor was sufficient to establish
the credit of customers. A deposit,
he said. might be demanded in de
fault of either of these.
The conference was in session
two days before Seattle was repre
sented. Corporation Counsel Cald
well said his office was not notified.
Meier will go carefully over the pro
cedure of those two days. He ob
tained the right to contest, in writ
ing. any action deemed unfair to
the people of Seattle.
' The commission is maneuvering
to get the municipally owned utili
ties under Its control, all right,"
said Meier. That's what the cor
poration-owned utility people want
badly. The commission only has
the right to govern our electrical
construction rule s. They plan to
combine them with the general
rules. In this way something will
bo sllpepd over on a good many
littlo towns that own utilities.
They will blindly follow all com
mission rules.''
The deposit features is regarded
as a profitable play on the part of
utility corporations. Thousands of
dollars in deposits are accrued an
nually by gas and electric compa
nies because the drposlts are ta\ed
on minor technicalities, or absorbed
because the depositors forget
about the deposits.
Rules on electrical construction
will be considered at n continuation
of the hearing, In Seattle, at the
Chamber of Commerce December 5.
