t NEW HOME OPEN
The most. Important event In the
history of Logan business life 1b tho
opening of1 the- new" Shamhart-Chrls-tiansen
Store on South Main street,
that will take placo Monday morn
ing. All the people pf Logan and
tho valley havo watched tho prog
ress of. this new homo and as thoy
havo seen it grow pile on pile, have
wondorod at the slzo nnd elegant
appointment of this structure What
ever ones Imaginations have plcturo
ed back of that Ihlgh-board fence
wo are proparcd to say that tho pjc
turo there will eclipse tho most ex
travagant fancies. This now homo
Is a monument to tho faith In Lo
gan's futuro, of both tho builders
and those who occupy this business
block. The slzo of the building Is
100x200 feet, giving 20000 square
feet of floor space on the main floor
then tho basement has 8000 and the
mezzanine floors 12,000 making In
all 40,000 square feet of floor spaco.
Now when ono stops to realize that
this mammoth store Is In Logan and
every foot of floor space Is utilized
for stocking and displaying the mer
chandise carried In this big depart
ment store and in dotall and appoint
ment Is as complete as a Marshall
Field or Wanamaker storo could pos
sibly be. Is It not credlblo and
something to bo proud of? Wonders
grow as one walks through the build
ing, Its arrangement and decoration
Is harmonious, practical and beauti
ful. Why say more, to bo appre
ciated It must be seen. We feel
sure that everybody will want to
visit this magnificent storo as soon
as it Is open to tho public. It Is
one pf tho finest stores west of the
Mississippi River and we are proud
of it. It Is hopod that all the people
who call Logan homo will feel that
way about It. No pains or expense
has been spared to arrange for the
M convenience of the -shopper or visi
tor. Messrs. Shamhart and Christian
sen are the merchant princes, crown
ed. Wo nro for thorn and oxpoct
that they will bo as surprised in the
response of tho people as tho people
are In tho magnlfloence of their now
home. We aro all proud of It and
wish It the enjoyment of tho hatf
mllllon dollar business they nro pro

A. A. LAW
lljr on Attorney of tho
Logan Itnr.
I always loved tho Cache Valley
product above all others and I trust
that my friends throughout tho state,
democrats as well as republicans will
permit me to say (it Is pardonable
pride) that here we have tho best
country as well as tho best pooplo
to be found under the bluo sky.
Tho subject of my brief sketch
Is a Cache Valley product, of whom
wo are all justly proud, Irrespective
of party lines.
Ho Is entirely n self-made man,
with a liberal education, and his
training has been such as to pitur 1
him a splendid understanding of tho
varied avocations and walks of life,
of tho wants, deeds and requirements
of the citizens generally.
He Is a man who mado his way
from the plow to the halls of the
Legislature. In his youth 'ho per
foinicd all jnannnr of farm and
ranch work; h'e 'also worked as n
miner In Its varied branches.
As a' young man ho -taught .school
for a couple ''of years,' and he "th'us
became convinced of the necessity
of a more liberal education. He had
always been solf-supportlng from
tho days of his early childhood and
was an Inspiration for good to many
of tho young men of his neighbor
hood, and acquired early tho habit
of lending a helping hand to those
In need.
Mr. 'Low wanted a college educa
tion In tho legal line, but he was
without means to go East where such
courses were taught, and ho had a
family to support, what did he do?
Why, ho simply applied himself to
homo study and got that education,
by hard work and practical applica
tion. He was a deciple of tho old
adage "Seek and ye shall find."
From so humble a beginning this
self-mado man, through habits of
temperance, thrift and Industry, now
commands tho-respect nnd'hlgh os
'toem of both tho' classes' and tho
masses.
Ho has no small ways; no small
vices; no sinister motives. Wo who
know him lovo him as a friend; we
of, tho bar respect him as. an oppon
ent. His largo and trusting clien
tage, nmongst which may bo Includ
ed tho principle cltlos nnd towns of
our beautiful valley, will regret to
loso him as tholr advisor, but will
take prldo In electing him to tho
bench, and hero lot me say, that
ho will bo a NON-r ARTISAN judge,
dealing out Justlco to all.
In concluding I deslro to congrat
ulate Mr. Law upon his record of
usefulness to our peoplo generally,
and I congratulato tho peoplo In nd
vanco who may nttest to tho samo
at tho tfolls on November 7th, 1916,
for a man of sound Judgment and
unquostlonod Integrity will bo placed
on tho bench.

EXPLANATION
Logan, October 30
Editor Republican :
In your issue of Saturday, Octob
er 28, appeared a number of erron
eous statements and some inferences
regarding the taxation of our re
spective lauds, couched in such terms
as to convey the impression that
wc had used the office of county
commissioners to favor ourselves in
the matter of assessments,
Relative to the tracts quoted in
your issue of Saturday, wc present
herewith the figures taken from the
tax rolls showing our assessments as
compared with those of our neigh
bors on adjoining lands, which
should be sufficient answer;
E. Ucrgeson, 760 acres, $3,080 valu
ation. John I.arscn, 1G0 acres, $640 valua
tion. Martha Jenkins, 55 acres, $220 val
uation. M. K. Coolcy, 80 acres, $320 valua
tion. Amos Clark, 40 acres, $160 valua
tion. Nina Stewart, 267 acres, $93.50 val
uation. Mr. Bcrgcson purchased his tract
which is mountain grazing land from
Mat tin Pond, of l.ewiston, paying
therefor $4 per acre, which is the
amount of which he is assessed.
Assessed valuations of land ad
joining tracts owned by Commission
er Facer:
At Avon
J. J. Facer, 26 acres, $520 valua
tion. Rory Allen, 17.63 acres, on the
ii'iitli, $225 valuation.
Sampson Knowlcs, 40 acres on the
west, $360 valuation.
V. T. Lemon, 19.10 acres on the
east, $380 valuation.
Polly A. Frcdcrickson, 10.35 acres,
on the north, $150 valuation.
At Hyrum
J. J. Facer, 10 acres, $1000 valua
tion. Jeusinc Weeding, 7.50 acres on the
south and east, $700 altiatiou.
P. L. Peterson, 10.65 acres on the
north, $800 valuation.
Sophia Peterson, 8.50 acres, $750
valuation.
At College
J. J. Facer, 117 acres, $3,510 valua
tion. Joseph H. Watkins, 90 acres, $2500
valuation.

valuation.

FIGURES IN
REPUBLICAN
NOT DENIED
In the first place there is not one
figure presented in the above state
ment of Commissioners Facer and
Ucrgeson that does not check exact
ly with the figures we presented con
ccrniiug these gentlemen, and for
their official confirmation of our fig
ures, wc arc indebted to them and
thank them. This then wipes away
the charge that our figures were er
roneous as any taxpayer can clearly
see.
As to Mr. Ucrgeson. He claims to
have purchased his land from Mar
tin Pond, paying $4 per acre for it,
on account of which he saw fit to
lower the assessment placed upon it
by the assessor, charged under his
bonds with the performance of his
duties without fear or favor. Note"
that lie docs not say when he pur
chased the land or wiiat it is worth,
simply wiiat lie paid for it. Many an
individual can drive a sharp bargain
and no doubt Mr. Bcrgcson is one of
those fellows.
It may be true that some few of
li is friends and neighbors arc assess
ed likewise, but with many it is dif
ferent. fH'
At tltis writing we have in our
hands a tax notice of one of iiis
friends and neighbors in l.ewiston
for 9 acres of laud ttiat was purch
ased for less than $4 per acre, as
sessed at $800 more than any 240
acres of Mr. Bcrgcson's as referred
to in his 760 acres. Wc hold anoth
er notice same locality 40. acres pur
(Contlnuod on pago four)
DEMOCRATS
BOLSTERING
UP BAMBERGER
The Democratic party Is having an
awful tlino bolstering up tho candi
dacy of Simon Hamburger and every
time the record Is referred our
friends down tho street tako a fit,
The do not llko to havo his record
on tho Agricultural College dug up
became thoy know It Is tho record
that counts.
Some of Simon's stunts aro funny
Ono of his lntost Is that ho will save
the state 20 per cent on his own tax
es. Thero Is tho rub. Tho farmers
don't want the taxes reduced on I1I3
railroads, they aro low enough al
ready. They want taxes reduced on
their farms.
1 'illere Is ono that while It has done
him some good In the pnst nnd great
lyjcnrlched him, It Is very likely to
break his back on November 7th
He claims to havo sacrlllced
much for prohibition from tho fact
that whon ho leased his Lagoon re
sort after Davis county had gone
dry ho had to cut tho leaBo $6,000.
He thinks $0,000 per year n tremen
dous sacrifice for prohibition but tho
Lagoon Millionaire should flKuro up
th'o money he has mado through
whiskey at tho Lagoon resort. Ho
has been running tho placo for per
haps twenty years or more. $6,000
for twenty years Is Just $120,000
on that ono Item alono that Simon
has put in his pocket which Is a
neat llttlo sum to bo charged up
against his $6,000 sacrifice for nro-
hlbitlou.
fAgajn ho s,ays ho didn't own tho
saloon at Lagoon. Ho audaciously
says "Da railroad owned do saloon
and I owned do railroad. '
.Nevertheless Mr. Hamburger Is a
very charitable man, as for Instance,
olio of his latest acts was to send a
fteo pass to conference and return
t numberless bishops and presidents
eft stakes throughout tho Btato. He
s);s, ho believed In prohibition and
was i In favor of Farmlngton going
dry long before he over thought of
running for governor. Mr. Voter
do you think ho over thought of
sending passes to these bishops and
presidents of stakes beforo he
thought of being governor?
Mr. Hamburger more than a year
ago announced that ho was rotlrlng
from business from (ho fact that hq
had mado onough money to Batlfy
his wants, and further that ho was
too old to glvo It tho tlmo and at
tention It demanded. Now that Mr.
namburgor has decldod that his prl
vato business Is of such magultudo
that at his age ho cannot glvo It
tho tlmo and attention that It do
mnnds, ho may rest assured that tho
peoplo of Utah will not want to on
trust In his care the handling of a
$500,000,000 corporation. In other
wordB, If through age, energy and de
slro he cannot attend to his own
business, tho peoplo will not olect
him to tako caro of their business.
