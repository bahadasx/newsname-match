HEALTH AUTHORITIES
STAMP OUT DIPT? ERIA
No New Cases And Those
Who Were Sick Have
Recovered
Last week there was more or less
unea iness in Bogalusa in families
where there were children on ac
count of a death, due to diptheria
and the announcing of three 'other :
cases. However Bogalusa was more '
fortunate than most other cities forl t
the disease has been completely I
stamped out, there being no new I
cases 'and those who were ill have 1
already, or, are recovering. That I
Bogalusa did not have more cases, I
as cities of this size usually do, is I
due to the splendid sanitary con- I
dition of the city and the manner I
in which the local Board of Health I
worked on the cases when they I
developed and took every precaution
to keep it from spreading. Dr. J. H.
Slaughter, President of the Board of E
Health, met last week with the
Commission Council when the 1
situation was thoroughly gone over.
In several Mississippi tos, andsi
especdlyv 'Jacktso thee wr a
large number of cases and in the i
latter city the health authortles
have advised the killnd of all dogs
and cats.
TURKETS SCARCE AlD HIGH
PRICE TlHAllKSCIIG
Chicago, Oct 26-The turkey will
not be the piece de resistance for
Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner
of many persons who are depending I
on the middle west for their birds
this year. Dealers here say a tre
nmendous turkey shortage is in pros.
pect and the prices at holiday time
will be in the neighborhood of 35ct
a pound.
Last year the price was 28 cents
and the year before 25 cents- Meat
prices will be 50 per cent higher in
some cases, The receipts of hogs at
the stock vards are falling off stead
ily and lean, ranvgy animals form
the bulk of the supply.
' Farmers can not afford to fatten
hogs because of the high price of
grains. The same applies to beeves.
