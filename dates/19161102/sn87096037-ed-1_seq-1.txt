Reasons \7 Iiy Hughes Should Es Elected
BECAUSE he stands fur Protection, Prosperity, Preparedness and Patri
otism.
BECAUSE he will not permit partisanship to triumph over Patriotism.
BECAl'SE his speech of acceptance expresses his desire to co-operate with
labor for its advantage, not to exploit it for his own.
BECAUSE he will command t!ie respect of Europe and Asia and win
the friendship of Latin-America.
BECAUSE he will never by proclamation deny the right of Americans
to pursue their business in other lauds under the protection of the
BECAUSE he will not repudiate the American flag in any land.
•BECAUSE hi* will not put action into words, hut words into action.
BECAUSE, as Theodore Koosevelt well says, he has high sentiments
of justice and dignity, is upright and straightforward, is an ineon
testable master of judicial matters, and always translates his words
into deeds.
BECAUSE he is a strong, sure, courageous man, with a clear-cut program
before him and with the courage, intelligence and determination to
carry it out and bring to our country self-respecting peace and
world-wide aspect.
BECAUSE as Governor of New York he has already proved that he
dared to do the right thing, and is prepared to further do and dare
when called into a wider field.
'BECAUSE he is not a dreamer and not a quitter.
BECAUSE he is a tirm friend of preparedness for the United States
and not for preparedness through political expediency.
BECAUSE he will not burden us with war taxes in time of peace.
BECAUSE we need a tarilf not founded upon free trade, nor for "reve
nue only," but to protect American labor and American industry
from the deadly competition of the foreigner.
BECAUSE he is a red-blooded American. His policy will be "America
first, America efficient."
BECAUSE he ui be depended upon to keep-platform pledges.
BECAUSE he will protect this country against being flooded with the
cheap niaii •nctures of Europe after the war.
BECAUSE be is the chosen head of a party which has long fathered
all great constructive legislation which experience hits proved to
be wise and which has invariably been opposed bv the Democratic
party,
BECAUSE a business man is going to be especially needed in the next
few years. In consequence of the European war a rremendoiis rcsuV
justment of the world's busine.-s is ahead. The United States must
pe economically prepared. It must not, as now, be left defense
less. It must not have a President with an untrained business
mind, ever changing. iJr. Hughes made a remarkable record as
a business Governor of New York. He has extraordinary ability
to see all sides of a question. Not from him. as from Wilson, will
be heard any declaration that he will hang business men "high as
Hainan" if they do not agree with him.
BECAUSE he is a man of forward vision, of practicability and tmnness,
not a mere rhetorician and theorist.
BECAUSE he stands for I 'no protection of American lives and property
ubi'oud as well as at home.
BECAUSE through him the whole nation will be in tj.ie Government.
It will not be rilled by one section, nor by one man'
BECAUSE he is for an effective, not an unsound and sham system
of rural credits to help the farmer.and for a wise conservation of
natural resources.
BECAUSE he is for a Federal workingmen'-? compensation law suitable
for the employes of the Government, and those employes engaged
in interstate commerce and subject io the hazard of injury.
BECAUSE he favors investigating before legislating.

CROP RAISERS FOOT BILL TO
PAY FOR BROTHERHOOD DEAL
Reasons Why Wilson Should Be Defeated
Democratic Nominee Leveled a Body
Blow at the Interests of Our Agri
cultural Communities When at the
BEOAt-Kh, to cite Representative Fitzgerald, Democratic Chairman of
the Appropriations Committee of tlie House, during his administra
tion the Democratic Congress 1ms been the most extravagant that
has ever met in the capital.
BKCAFSF he insists on his shipping bill—an indefensible piece of folly
which would destroy such merchant marine as we now have.
BECAl'SK, although lie says "he kept us out of war," the story of
Mexico, San Domingo and Hayti refutes him.
BIX .VI Sh lie runs anti-climaxes. ITe marches in only to march out
again.
BKCAl. SF he signed the seamen's bill, which practically has wiped out
shipping on the Pacific Coast.
.BhCAl.'Sh he attempted to scuttle from the Philippines and was defeated
only by twenty patriotic Democrats who voted with the Republi
cans of the House.
BECAUSE lie appointed as Secretary of State William J. Bryan after
denouncing him as a pest who should be "knocked into a cocked
hat."
BKCAl'SE he made possible Villa, murderer of men and despoiler
of women, and Carranza, tli« fatuous and futile "First Chief."
IKl AI Sh ilson text book statesmanship and grape-juice diplomacy
have made the United States an international laughing stock.
BECAUSE lie appointed "deserving Democrats" to the diplomatic corps,
displacing experienced men at a time when it was essential to the
foreign trada anf honor of the fruited States to retain competent,
experienced men.
BECAT SE lie is incompetent t« lead, and veers like a weather vane
whenever a zephyr of public opinion seems to blow against him.
BECATuSE his "one-track mind" has too many turn-tables.
BECAUSE he lifted the embargo of arms so that the Mexican despe
radoes have used American ammunition to murder American sol
diers and civilians.
BKCACS]•: the promised "pitiless publicity" has been replaced by private,
special, secret negotiations by personal agents and representatives,
appointed by President Wilson without "the advice and consent
of the Senate."
BECAUSE lie reverses himself so rapidly that the entire country is
seasick from the motion.
BECAUSE lie is for free trade, (Tirect taxes and an empty treasury—
the same old Democratic trinity.
BECAl'SK if the Payne-Aldrich taw had boon in operation in the
last nine months of 1915 we would have .collected $91,656,161 more
than wo did under the Underwood law. It would have met the
treasury deficits and have avoided war taxes. The foreigner selling
ill our market got the entire benefit of the $91,656,161.
BECAUSE during the first ten months of the Wilson-Underwood law
there were more unemployed being fed by charity than during
any ten months in our nistory, excepting under the Wilson^
!oi»iinn act.
Behest of an Exclusive Group of
Railroad Workers He Increased
Their Pay Without Investigating the
Justice of the Demand.
(Jharlos E. Hughes, who left Lincoln
lor his second day's campaigning in
Nebraska, told a crowd of farmers In
his speech here that the Democratic
Administration had ignored the agri
cultural interests of the country in
urging the enactment of the Adainson
Ir.w. The nominee, in support of his
contention, cited a telegram from
President II. X. I'ope of the Texas
Farmers' Union to President Wilson
requesting thai the farmers be per
mitted to submit data in arbitration
proceedings between the railroads and
the brotherhoods. He said:
"1 want to say in reference to rates
that it seems to me the farmers of
the country were very little consid
ered the other day when on the de
mand of the Administration the wages
of a group of railroad workers were
increased by law, in response to force.
Somebody lias got to pay the Increased
bills, and the fanners will know very
quick who has to pay them.
"The farmers were not represented
in this discussion, if you may call it
thut in this surrender. 1 have here
a copy of a telegram that was sent to
the President by Mr. Pope, the presi
dent of the State Farmers' Union of
Texas, which I shall read to you:
'We ask tha't you make no con
cessions or commitments that will
in any manner cause nn increase
BECAUSE of his inconsistency on the immigration bill. In his "His
tory of the American People," vol. 5, p. 31.3, he wrote: "The Chi
were more to be ""(frsired woikmeu, if not as citizens, than
most of the coarse crew that came crowding in every year at the
BKCAUSE lie has not reduced, as he promised, the high cost of living,
but has actually made it higher.
BECAUSE lie was pledged to a single term by the Baltimore conven
tion, tint before the type was cold he was building up his fences
for another.
BECAl'SK. although posing as an advocate of civil service, every act of
his President in con lection with civil service has been adverse to
its principles, obstructive and destructive of its bonafide practice.

in freight rates on products pro
duced or consumed on the farm.
The men who pay the freight have
an equity in this dispute, which
neither the railroad trainmen nor
I In- railroad managers have au
thority to represent. If it is your
iiiienlion to personally dispose of
the nialter we ask that you post
|ii)iie Inn her consideration until a
committee of farmers can prepare
Information and data to present
I heir side of the case. If you con
clude to settle by arbitration, then
the organized farmers should:
have representation on any arbi
tral ion committee that may be
formed to dispose of tills questjpn
for the men who pay should have
representation as well as the men
who receive it.
'We again urge that all ques
tions involved be settled by arbi
tration, where all parties and all
interests can lie heard and the
subject dealt with aside from
haste and intimidation.'
The crowd cheered when Mr.
Hughes concluded reading the tele
gram
"No regard was paid to that mes
sage."' Mr. Hughes said. "The busi
ness men of the country, through the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States, were at the same time and
had for many weeks before been Im
ploring the executive and leaders in
congress for an immediate and prompt
inqfliry in order that the Justice of
this matter might be known. The
farmers were not there except through
the presence of the representatives of
lie people in congress, and those rep
resentatives were asked to abdicate
their authority.
"I am in favor of everything that
can reasonably be done for the pro
motion of agriculture. I am glad to
note tlie work of the Agricultural De
partment. It will be continued with
me, Jf I am intrusted with the power,
lo the utmost of efficiency under my
administration.
"i'.ui it is idle to talk of interest
in the farmer when you have action
like this taken in congress overnight,
against the protests of the farmer,
and leveling a body blow at the in
terests of our agricultural communi
ties."
Mr. Hughes again denied the dec
laration that a vote for lilm "meant a.
vote for war."
