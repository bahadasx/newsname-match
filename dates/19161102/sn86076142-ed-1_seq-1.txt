Charles E. Hughes wound up his cam
paign in the middle west with a
speech here last nlghf and left
shortly afterwards for points in New
York, the last state in which be will
appear before election. .
Mr. Hughes made four speeches
yesterday, in which he outlined poli
cies he intends to follow if elected;
assailed the administration for the
enactment of the Underwood tariff
and Adamson law, and expressed the
opinion that he would win. He
spoke last night night to an audi
ence after reviewing a torchlight
parade. Just before his departure the
nominee issued the following state
ment: "I am leaving Indiana after what
is perhaps the most wonderful recep
tion ever given a candidate for the
presidency, This splendid tribute
was not to me personally, but as
the representative of the great
united Republican party moving for
ward to victory and service for the
nation. The men of Indiana have or
ganized a people's victory and I want
to thank the leaders of - the reunited
Republican party for their effective
work."
Mr. Hughes, on his final day in
the middle west, devoted much of his
speeches to the tariff. He addressed
two audiences at Linton and Brazil,
composed largely of employes of the
coal mining companies.
"We had soup houses and bread
lines twenty months ago," he told
his audience at Linton, "and we will
have them again If we" do not pro
tect American Industry and if we
attempt to carry on the business of
this country on the policy indicated
in the Underwood bill.

said at Brazil, "under our present

In discussing the tariff, Mr. Hughes

They conferred on the pier, the cap

RUMORS GERMANY HAS BROKEN PLEDGES

WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. The state
department Is ' still waiting .on the
German version of the destruction ot
the Marina with the loss of Ameri
can lives. It also expects affidavits
and other data gathered from Ameri
can survlvorB whereon to determine
whether the German pledges to the
United States were violated.
A news dispatch from Athens say
ing that the Greek government has
been notified that Germany Intends to
sink without warning ships carrying
supplies to the allies is regarded as
of great Importance. Thus far the
United States has not received such
notification and it Ib not known
whether one was sent to the other
neutrals. Such a procedure would
be regarded by the United States as
directly contrary to Germany's
pledges.
Secretary Lansing said today that
he understands the German pledges
not to sink merchantmen, without
warning and without providing safety
for the passengers and crew applies
to ships with defensive armament.
No distinction was made in the cor
respondence between armed and un
armed vessels and the state depart
ment does not accept the contention
that Germany's responsibility is lim
ited to those without armament. It
is admitted that Germany always has
taken a distinct view of the status
of armed ships and it is thought
probable that it will attempt to Inject
th Ib point In the present situation.
As long as the policies ot the two
governments are utterly divergent. It
la possible that Germany . may use
the Marina case to settle the isaue.
Germany on February 10 notified the
United States as follows: "Enemy
merchantmen armed with guns have
no longer the right to be considered
peaceable merchant vessels of com
merce; ' therefore, the German navai
forces will receive orders to treat
' such vessels as belligerents."

WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. Interest
here in the arrival of the German

New London, Conn., on her second

tions for establishing a submarine
line mail service between the United
States and Germany. The post office
department let It be known that it
waB prepared to accept a proposal
made through the German embassy
that the Deutschland and other ships
that may ply out of American ports
carry not more tnnn auu pounim ui
first class mail at the regular trans-

rangement will be worked out at
conferences between officials of the
embassy and the department, and It
is hoped an agreement may be
reached In time for the Deutschland
to take her first consignment of mall
when she sails from New Iondon
Embassy officials do not disguise
their Interest in the plan. It would
provide the first uncensored man
service from this side of the ocean
to Germany since tne beginning oi

effect on the exchange of aecurltle
between the two countries.
