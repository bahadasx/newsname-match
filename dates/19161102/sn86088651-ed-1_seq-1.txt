Preventing Voters From Going to the

Mesns Unlawful.
San Antonio, Texas, Nov. 2. The
anti prohibitionists of Bee county won
a temporary victory which may be
come a final victory If they prove
their allegations. In a decision handed
down Wednesdsy by the Fourth court
of civil appeals, reversing , and re
manding the case of A. C. Marsden et
al y. Charles Troy, county attorney.
The case had to do with a local option
election last spring wherein the coun
ty went "dry" by twenty-nine votes.
The antls contested the election on
the main allegation that a proclama
tion had been Issued notifying all so-
called "foreigners" thst they could not
vote unless they presented at the polls
certificates showng that they had tak
en out final naturalization papers
Chief Justice W..S. Fly, who wrote
tho opinion, pointed out then under the
Texaa constitution an alien who has
'declared hia Intention" of becoming
a citizen of the I'nlted Statea la en
titled to vote.
In reversing and remanding the case
Justice Fly Instructed the lower court
to retry It In accordance with the su
preme court's views. If It can be
proved that residents of Bee county
were prevented from voting either di
rectly or Indirectly by the election of
ficials, even though they did not actu
ally offer to vote, and if It can be
shown that the ballots of those who
were thus prevented from exercising
the right of suffrage would have
changed the elctlon either way, eald
Justice Fly, the election would be null
and void.
