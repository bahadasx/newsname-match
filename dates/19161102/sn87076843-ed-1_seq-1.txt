(Editorial in Sentinel-Tribune,
Citizens of Wood county will
not be surprised to learn that
Franklin P. Riegle whom they pre
sented to Republicans at the con
gressional primaries is command
ing the respect and fast winning
the support of voters in other
counties of the Thirteenth Dis

neer, this successful lawyer, bank
president and practical farmer is
impressing the voters of the other
counties of our district as the sort
of a man that Wood county people
know him to be, capable, straight
forward, well informed, energetic.
Voters are drawn to him as his
Iegisla ive record becomes known.
His career as representative in the
legislature from Wood county is
doing him valuable service in his
campaign for congress. His ser

briefly here just before Gov.
Willis addressed a Bowling Green

trait of his. He is willing to grant
the other fellow the right of opin

tell exactly what be himself thinks

YOUNG JAMES GANG
Two Young Boys Steal Horse and
Buggy.
On Sunday last two young boys
saw Henry Sill leave his horse and
buggy hitched at theide of the
road near Maple Grove and go
down the bank to the river and
commence fishing. They unhitched
the horse and drove away.
"When Sill camo up from the
river he discovered his loss and im

of the rig and its occupants.

On Mojiday they were given a
hearing before Justice Cook where
they told several conflicting stories,
but were finally trapped by the

wero from Chicngo and had been
in Detroit and Toledo. They gave
their names as Cyrus Malzahn and
Edward Winkelinun, and they
wero about 1G years of age. They
carried a very small suit caso con

A few explanatory remarks con
crriiimr the Initiative and Referen
dum vole lo hi' taken next week may
be of service to many who are not
acquainted with the matter.
B. this vote two questions are to
be h-i'ided:
1st. A general policy for Perrys
burg as to the location of all future
m 'eualks.
2d. An answer to a specific rc
qmst by a pioperty owner on Lo
cust street to place the sidewalk for
oue particular block ten feet nearer
fhe center of the street than the ex
ist ng walks on that street, and like
wise ten feet farther from the lot
line than any other sidewalk in the
town.
On the first question 1 lit voters
are asked to ratify an established
custom oi nearly one numircu years
in the upbuilding of Pcrrysburg.
This custom, as any observer can
notice, is the placing of our side
walks four feet from the lot line.
An affirmative vote then will make
a matter of official record what
Pcrrysburg has always considered
the proper distance, and will pre
vent all future controversies on this
subject, making impossible the un
pleasantness that has arisen over
the
SECOND QUESTION.
Here we have a clash between
public rights and individual de
sires. The public has a right and
is in duty bound to maintain the
splendid width of its streets. This
wonderful advantage over all other
towns and cities has been given to
Pcrrysburg by our wise and broad
minded forefathers. All preceding
generations have been faithful to
the trust. All of our former Coun
cils have patriotically refused to
Wtow C.lcroacimwniS OI tills Cliai'
int.
tW'ter on the public streets and with-
irr the last few years they have,
much lo their credit, twice turned
down requests of exactly the same
nature.
Why, then, should a bare major
ity of our present Council depart
from the time honored custom and
vote to grant such a redical change
at tjie expense of the public as in
this instance?
Tho blessed Initiative and Refer
endum has been given to the people
to meet just such emergencies as
this. By it you, Mr. Voter, are
given the opportunity to take such
important questions out of the
hands of your temporary officers
and decide them yourselves for the
public good.
In years past when the property
owners .surrounded their homes
with fences on the lot line, an ob
server judged the width of the
streets by the line of fences. Now,
since by custom the fences have
been removed, the observer can only
distinguish the breadth of our
streets by the distance between the
walks on either side. If these walks
are gradually allowed to be placed
nearer and nearer the center ot the
street (and what is fair for one is
fair for all), shade trees will also
he planted nearer tho center, and
we will have in time narrow streets.
The observer, Ma-. Voter, is the
stranger in our town, the prospect
ive buyer of lots and builder of
homes. To him our wide streets
mean more than to us because we
have always enjoyed them. They
have been the attraction which
brought him here.
In the case of the block on Locust
street, it is argued that a walk
placed Mice all other walks in town,
four feet from the lot line, will en
croach on two shade trees. Actual
measurements have shown that this
encroachment is a matter of inches.
What harm can there be in allow
ing this to be so? There is no need
of considering the removal of the
trees. Other cities have met the
saino conditions without either the
removal of the trees or the change
of the sidewalk line.
This specific matter is a small one
compared to the great municipal
policy of broad and beautiful
streets.
Wo havo still in Perrysburg
patriotic men who will defend the
interest of tho people as a whole
against the encroachment of tho in
dividual, even though they unwil
lingly may lose friendships in so
doing. For this thoy deservo all
honor. Let every voter fall in lino
and do likewise, and cast his vote
for tho good of tho community.
QPTIW,
The boys of P. II. S. Athletic
Society organized their Soccer
ball team for the coming season,
with Arthur Mcintosh as captain
and Wayne llartzcll as malinger.

exciting and ended with the score
of 4 to 1, in favor of Perrysburg.

Cygnet sometime in the near fu
ture. Last Thursday the team played
Scott High of Toledo. Although
