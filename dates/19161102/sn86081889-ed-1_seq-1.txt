RECORD OF DEATHS. .
Short Sketches of the Lives of Per
sons Who Bare Recently
- Passed- Away.
Philip M. Covault. .
Philip M. Covault (or Covalt,as
the name is spelled in this coun
ty) was born in Fulton county,
Pa., July 1, 1828, and died at his
home in Hartford City, Ind., Oc
tober 15, 1916, aged 88 years, 3
months and 14 days. A widow
and one daughter survive.
When 14 years of age, Mr.-Co-valt,
with his father and mother
and ten brothers and sisters made
. the trip from this county to Indi4
ana by wagons, three weeks be
ing spent in making the journey.
The name of Philip's father was
Jacob, who lived only about a year
after they reached their destina
. tion. -
The deceased is a relative! of
theCovalts living in the lower
part of this county, and he will
be remembered by many of the
older residents. Philip conducted
a jewelry Btore in Hartford City
for more than forty years, and he
was a prosperous and highly re
spected citizen.
Catharine Josephine Mellott
Catharine Josephine, infant
daughter of Mr. and Mr3. George
C. Mellott, of East Market Street,
died at two o'clock Tuesday
morning, October 31, 1916, aged
8 weeks. A heavy cold resem
bling grippe wa3 the cause of her
death. Funeral was held on
Wednesday afternoon, interment
being made in Union cemetery.
Rev. Edward Jackson conducted
the funeral services. Mr. and Mrs.
Mellott have the sincere sympathy
of all their friends in this sad
hour, they having lost a child by
death last February and one prior
to that, leaving them but one of
their four children.
Ugly Auto Accident.
After having visited friends in
Huntingdon county, Mrs. W. R.
Enyeart, son Glenn, grandson
Clarence and daughter, Mrs. Ed
Conlyn all of Girard, 0., passed
through McConnellsburg going
west Monday. The Bteering post
did not seem to be working freely
when here, and after some tem
porary repairs at a local garage,
they proceeded on their way. At
the top of Scrub Ridge, the post
became rigid, the car ran wild,
crashed into a tree, throwing the
occupants violently from the car.
They were all more or less in
jured, but none seriously. The
car was bro6ght to the Cline gar
age for repairs, and the party left
for their home by rail Wednesday.
Mawsh Benny.
The National Voters' League
has issued its publication describ
ing the work jot Pennsylvania
Congressmen. It places the
word "mawsh" after Mr. Focht's
name. This means "might as
well stay home." In other words,
after five or six terms in Con
gress, this organization decides
that Focht's record is empty,
sounding brass and a tinkling
cymbal. Free seeds and a share
of "pork" in the form of a pub
lic building do not make a Con
gressman nor does such achieve
ment impress the Voters' League.
The people of the district will
certainly ratify the League's ver
dict on Nov. 7. Every little X
has a meaning of its own and op
posite the name of Geo. A. Har
ris it signifies "mawsh", to Benny
Focht-Adv.

FOCHT ON THE HUSTINGS.
Attention to Official Business in fash
.ington an Important Factor.
From the Duncnnnon Record, Oot SO.
Hon.' Benj. Ki Focht. Repre
sentative of the 17th Congres
sional district, was next presented
and as Judge Shull remarked,
needed no introduction, as "Ben"
is so well known here, and in fact
all over the district, that he can
call by name more friends to the
square mile than any other man
who ever represented this dis
trict His popularity is really lit
tle short of marvelous; even little
children on the street have been
heard to call him by name and
there are very few homes within
the 17th district where his name
is not mentioned with respect and
deep admiration. He is known
as the man with the great hu
mane heart, who is the champion
and protector of the indigent old
and who abhors the practice of
congregating human beings, as
so many cattle, in the institutions
known as poor houses. His ad
dress continued for a full hour
and was a revelation ' to the big
crowd who forgot the biting cold
of the chill October night, en
tranced with the, eloquence and
power or this statesman who has
proven his ability to conduct the
affairs of this district at Wash
ington with honor and credit to
himself and his constituency.
His address was characteristic of
the man, and was considered the
best political speech heard in this
community in many years. There
is not a shadow of doubt that
"Ben" Focht is the right man for
the place and that he will be re
turned to Congress November
7th, by the largest majority ever
given a representative of the 17th
district Adv.
Celebrated Golden Wedding. '
Four children, twenty-two
grandchildren and six great
grandchildren, together with a
large number of other friends,
assisted last Sunday in the cele
bration of tne fiftieth anniver
sary of the wedding of Mr. and
Mrs. Jacob Strait, near Saluvia.
Notwithstanding his age, Mr.
Strait has a clear memory, and
he recounted many past experi
ences, to the entertainment of all.
Both he and Mrs. Strait bear ev
idence of having lived happily to
gether for half a century, and if
friends' wishes come true, they
will live to enjoy many more years
in the same manner. The table
was spread in the open and laden
with viands to tempt the appe
tite. The inscription cake bore
the dates 1866 and 1916.
Children and grandchildren
present were: Mr. and Mrs. Rob
ert W. Mellott and children, Quay,

Real Americans.
The P. 0. S. of A. at Shamokin
Dam, has sent a resolution to
Brother Focht denying him the
privilege of addressing them at
the district convention, says the
Selinsgrove Times. Their action
is a protest against his vote in
Congress to deprive Americans of
the right to travel on the sea as
neutrals unmolested. This is
courage of the right sort and
Americans everywhere should
disregard partisan leanings and
send into political exile any Con
gressman who will vote away our
rights as citizens. You can do
this effectively on Election Day.
Your fathers would have done it.
Your duty confronts you. Har
ris is for America first. Focht
voted for foreigners first Amer
icans will choose Harris. Adv.

FULTON COUNTY'S OPPORTUNITY.
Ever? Yotcr Should Be Interested.
' When Geo. A. Harris was nom
inated for Congress our people
considered it not only an honor to
the man but to Fulton county as
well. Since the nomination Mr.
Harris has made an aggressive
and active campaign which has
been free from petty politics.
Reports from newspapers from
all over the district, including
many independent and Republi
can papers, speak in the highest
terms of him. He has developed
strength wherever he has gone.
He is not ashamed to boost his
home county and wherever he
goes he holds out his home coun
ty as deserving of recognition.
Geo. Harris is one of our most
progressive citizens. He has al
ways lived and spent his money
in FuJton county. He has always
taken an active part in every
thing that is for the betterment
of Fulton county. Practically
every voter of our county at some
time or other has received favors
from Mr. Harris. It can be truth
fully said of him that he spends
more of his own time to help oth
ers without any recompense than
any other citizen in the county.
All the knowledge he has gained
in practical business life is free
to any one who asks him. He
makes no difference between the
rich and the poor and is the same
man wherever you meet him.
We feel sure before every vot
er marks his ballot on Nov. 7th,
he will conscientiously consider
the matter. It will only take a
minute to do him a favor on elec
tion day and you can rest as
sured he would spend hours with
you free of charge to help you in
some way. A large majority of
the voters of the county can tes
tify to this. He is a valuable as
set to FULTON COUNTY. Let
us make him more valuable.
We believe you are going to do
it Adv.
Looks Like a Winner.
(Orcencasile Progressive News.)
George A. Harris, Democratic
candidate for Congress in the 17th
Congressional District, looked
like a winner from the start He
is a self-made man deserving of
every honor the people can confer
upon him. From tanner to a
school teacher and banker is his
record of achievements in life,
filling each position with credit
and ability. By his industry he
forged ahead saving his earnings
and by a judicious use of his op
portunities and means acquired
a business standing of which he
can be proud.
He is the kind of man the dis
trict needs to look after its inter
ests and the people should elect
him regardless of his politics.
Better, have a good Democrat in
Congress than a Republican of
strange convictions or no convic
tions at all, who takes his orders
with no thought of the people and
votes in the interest of his master.
Mr. Harris looks like a winner
and the NEWS believes he will
be because he should be.
George A. Harris Here
Making Many Friends.
From Waynesboro Herald (Rvpiibllean).
Mr. George A. Harris, Demo
cratic candidate for Congress in
this district, is in town to-day
looking up his host of friends and
making many new ones. Mr.
Harris is making an energetic
campaign and feels much encour
agement over the outlook. The
failure of his opponent to support
the President in his stand for the
rights of Americans to sail the
seas and not be bullied by a for
eign power, with its murderous
submarines, as also his refusal to
vote for the child labor bill, has
brought many supporters to Mr,
Harris' standard in the district
who hold patriotism and human
ity above party. Adv.
Mrs. Rosa Houpt and son
Richard, of Mercersburg, were
guests of relatives on this side of
' the mountain during part of last
I week. -
They Want Wool.
On Wednesday of last week,
in Harrisburg, at a meeting of
Pennsylvania sheep raisers, it
was decided that an efficient dog
law be drawn up and presented
to the next General Assembly.
Mr. A. C. Bigelow, president of
the Philadelphia Wool and Tex
tile Association, was chairman of
the meeting, and he made some
statements about the wool situa
tion that may result in the re
moval of obstacles in the way of
restoring the' sheep industry in
Pennsylvania.
A recent private letter from L.
H. Wible, Esq., to a member of
the News staff conveyed the
information that a number of
Lancaster county farmers went
to Michigan a few days ago to
buy sheep, 'and that the State
sent with them an expert vet
erinary to inspect the sheep for
diseases. The veterinary will
be at the services of any Penn
sylvania farmer who may wish
to join the Lancaster men.
Mr. Wible also stated that the
Textile Association is not ready
for the distribution of sheep on
the shares. That may come
later.
Hotel Improvement.
Ex-Sheriff J. J. Harris evident
ly thinks that since living is
high, he and his guests might
just as well go a little higher up
in the air. Accordingly, on Mon
day morning, he began the ad
dition of a framework third
stfry to his hotel on west Lin
coln Way. Other improvements
in addition to the new story will
add twelve new rooms and two
baths to the building. When
completed, McConnellsburg will
have three modern hotels for the
accomodation of constantly in
creasing travel, and with the ex
ception of a few months during
rough weather, all three will have
all the patronage they can han
dle. During the past summer
many touring parties could not
find accommodations in town at
night
Keep Your Dime.
Do not answer a letter offering
you a model 1916 petticoat in
exchange for a dime, in addition
to writing a few letters. The
scheme is a fraud, and the post
office at address given will not
permit your letter to be delivered,
or if delivered, that will be the
last of your dime. 25, 000 women
"bit" and answered their letters
one day about three weeks ago.
They will never see the petticoat
The News has always done its
level best to protect its readers
from fraudulent advertisements
by cautioning them not to answer
letters and advertisements that
appear to offer unheard-of induce
mentsthey are always fraud
ulent The letters to which we
refer offer a $4.50 petticoat for
a dime and five letters.
Many Campers.
At the present time, about 4,-
000 people have taken advantage
of the privilege of leasing camp
sites on State Forestry Grounds
in Pennsylvania. Camp sites may
be rented for $3 to $15. The
permanent camps vary in style
from log cabins to fire proof steel
houses. Huntingdon county
leads in number with forty-three
leases. These -camps are In ad
dition to the army of temporary
campers who regularly seek the
State' Lands for recreation pur
poses. The permanent camps are
usually located miles from near
est settlement and they are prov
ing to be a great convenience to
the men of the State Forestry
Service when they are obliged to
spend a 'night far back in the
mountains.
One night last week, just
after dark, a bear crossed the
Lincoln Highway on this side of
Cove mountain. The bear pass
ed in front of an auto, not over
twenty yards away. Dogs from
town were taken to the spot but
they refused to follow, or could
not find the scent .
