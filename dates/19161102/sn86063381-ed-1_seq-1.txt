VAN SANT SUPPORTING
HUGHES FOR PRESIDENT
(Special to the Pioneer)
St. Paul, Minn Nov 2 Former
Governor S Van Sant today made
the following statement in answer to
the charge given circulation through
Democratic sources that he was sup
porting Wilson for president:
"I am not supporting Wilson. The
statement is a deliberate falsehood
and on a par with the Democratic
practices in this campaign. More
than 16 months ago, after the sink
ing of the Lusitania, I did commend
him So did the people and the press
of the country When I learned that
he was a man of words and not deeds,
I ceased to do so I cannot support a
president who has permitted the raur-
*-r of hundreds of Americans in
""Mexico by outlaws and bandits. I
tim supporting that splendid states
man, eminent jurist and great Amer
if leanCharles E. Hughes."

First of the undersea merchantmen
by use of which Germany hopes to
keep open a trade route with the
United States, the Deutschland, ac
cording to her captain, is at present
the only \essel of that fleet. The Bre
men, which started a voyage Aug.

named, he t-aid, has been given up as
last. He thought she "must have
struck a mine." but he added, "she
has not fallen a victim to this almost
blockade. I am sure of that."
The Amerika, which some reports
have indicated was a merchantman
submarine captured by the British,
never existed, Captain Koenig said.
"I must keep up this traffic alone
for the present, that is, the Deutsch
