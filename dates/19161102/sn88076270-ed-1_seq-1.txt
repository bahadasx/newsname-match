BEST INSTITUTE
FINISHES WORK
NEARLY 300 TEACHERS AND OF
FICERS FILL TWO DAYS WITH
HELPFUL WORK
Splendid Banquet Proves Happy Oc
casion—Sessions Marked By Alert
ness and Interest
"I have never attended a more suc
cessful Institute. The regular at
tendance at sessions and sustained in
terest and alertness of both teachers
and officers has been very gratifying."
This was the comment of A. G. Crane,
president of the Minot Normal who
was one of the conductors of the Wil
liams County Teachers' Institute held
Tuesday and Wednesday.
With an 'attendance of nearly 200
teachers and 85 district officers, be
sides a large number of school chil
dren competitors in the industrial
contest, the annual meeting just
closed was by far the largest and
most satisfactory ever held in the
county.
The program covered as much work
as could possibly be crowded into two
days and was presented by able lead
ers in education. Besides President
Crane, Prof. Altman of the Minot
Normal, N. C. MacDonald, State Rural
Inspector, T. G. Pasco of Fargo, Miss
Palmer and Miss LeFevre of Willis
ton assisted with the various depart
ments of the work.
Tuesday forenoon was devoted to
enrollment and the judging of indus
trial exhibits of corn, needlework and
canning. Over thirty ten-ear exhibits
of corn were offered and a large num
ber of exhibits of sewing and of
canned fruit and vegetables. The in
dustrial displays made an excellent
appearance and indicated the progress
in the plan of rural'education over
that employed only a few years ago.
The list of winners was not available
for this issue, but will be given next
week.
Tuesday afternoon was occupied by
joint sessions of teachers ana school
officers. Professor Crane gave a val
uable talk on "Health Conservation."
County Supt. Peterson spoke on
"Achievements and Recommenda
tions'' and Prof. Altman gave a talk
and a demonstration of games and
play. Mr. McDonald talked on "How
to Secure and Maintain a Good
School."
Wednesday forenoon was taken up
by the subjects of reading, penman
ship, preparing exhibits, managing
the hot lunch, English and language
and physical education.
Wednesday forenoon also included
the officers section.
President Larkin C. Hart of the
School Officers association delivered
the annual address^ and Mr. Crane
talked on "Marks of a Good School."
General discussions covered the top
ics of playground improvements, wa
ter supply, transportation, sanitation
and retaining good teachers. W. G.
Owens spoke on "School Law" and
Inspector MacDonald on "The Prob
lem of Rural Education."
Wednesday afternoon was devoted
to joint sessions of teachers and offi
cers. Mr. Crane talked on "The
Trained Teacher" and Dr. E. P. Rob
ertson, President of Wesley college
gave an eloquent address on "Com
munity Welfare."
The Banquet
Tuesday evening at 6:30 a banquet
was given for all those attending the
Institute and which was also attend
ed by several people from Williston.
This was intended as the social pe
riod for relaxing and getting ac
quainted its purpose in a delightful
manner. The program of toasts was
cleverly managed by H. W. Braa
telien who arose to the occasion and

N
Football Title
Coach Cutting and the managers of
the Williston high school football
team have sent a .challenge to the
Park River and Grafton high school
teams requesting a game with which
ever team wins in their game next
Saturday. By tying Minot and out
classing Sidney the team has shown
such remarkaole progress that its
supporters are confident it has a
slight edge on any school team in the
state.
Had the Minot game come a couple
of weeks later in the season the
friends of the Williston team are posi
tive that Minot would have been de
cisively beaten.
FORCE! CAUGHT
CHECK ARTIST WHO STUNG LO
CAL HOTEL FALLS INTO
DETECTIVE'S NET
The man, known here as C. E.
Smith, who on Sept. 19 succeeded in
cashing two $50 forged checks in this
city, has been apprehended at Santa
Barbara, Cal.. by the American De
tective Agency and is being held
there, according to information re
ceived by Chief of Police Nolan.
Smith claimed to be representing
the Perfection Bedding Company of
Chicago and the checks which ne cash
bore the name of that concern. The
first check was cashed by the Great
Northern hotel, and at the time Smith
secured the money he showed an or
der which he had taken from the
Hamre Furniture Company as evi
dence of his connection with the Per
fection Bedding Company. None of
the Great Northern clerks recall
cashing the second $50 check, but as
it turned up at the bank with the en
dorsement of the hotel, it is assumed
that Smith in some way obtained the
endorsement stamp and passed the
check.
Smith apparently was well supplied
with aliases, and at Billings, Mont.,
he attempted -to cash some checks
under the name of W. A. Adams. The
hotel there was suspicious and wired
the Perfection Bedding Company at
Chicago who at once replied that they
had no one by that name represent
ing them. They put the American
Detective Agency on the trail of the
criminal, but Smith, or Adams had
left Billings twelve hours before word
came to arrest him. He was trying
the same game at Santa Barbara,
Caljf. under the same of J. A. Strong
when arrested.
The Califoria authorities have noti
fied Sheriff Erickson that they will not
surrender the offender to North Da
kota until the charges held against
him there have been satisfied.
Press Comments
On "Civilization"
Press praise in New York and Chi
cage and the Northwest has never
been more profuse for any screen pro

Among some of the comments made
by the leading newspapers are the fol
lowing
"Greatest of all films. Nothing so
stupendous ever before conceived by
the brain of man. Greater than the

BY HIGH SCORE
TI NG'S ELEVEN SHOWS
GREAT CLASS IN GAME WITH
FAST MONTANA TEAM
Count 89 to 20—Fast Open Style Play
Made Game Exciting—Sidney
Boys Clean Sports
"Williston is the cleanest team we
have played this year." We are per
fectly satisfied with the treatment we
received from the players and from
the officials. We are surprised at Wil
liston's strength and found ourselves
outclassed.''
Such in substance were the frank
and sportsmanlike comments of mem
bers of the Sidney highschool team
after the game Saturday. Coach Brown
could hardly be convinced that the
Williston eleven was the same that
played his team at Sidney a few
weeks ago. Brown's boys had not
lost a game before this season and
had met several of the best teams in
eastern Montana including the Glen
dive high school team.
Showing remarkable improvement
over their work of the week before,
Coach Cutting's high school proteges
ran away from the Sidney high school
boys by 13 touchdowns to 3. Willis
ton kicked eleven of its goals while
Sidney succeeded in two trials out of
three, making the final score 89 to 20.
In spite of the uneven score, the game
was fascinating to watch, and the
crowd was on e'dge from first to last.
The Sidney boys fought hard and
proved that they were dangerous by
intercepting one of^ Williston's passes
and converting it into a touchdown
and negotiating two passes of their
own that resulted in touchdowns. The
work of the Sidney backfield was good
and in R. Kreis they have one of the
fastest halfbacks to be found on a
school team anywhere. Any time he
got possession of the ball and a couple
of feet in the clear he was gone.
In the line Williston showed great
superiority! over their opponents both
on-defence and offense. The work
with forward passes of Scott, Brueg
ger, Greengard and Gordon was un
usually excellent. A large majority
of the passes attempted were com
pleted.
Best of all the play was clean, sports
manlike and free from wrangling. The
work of the officials: Hurst of Sidney
and Harding of Williston was ac
ceptable to both sides* The Sidney
team was accompanied by a large
number rooters who supported their
team loyally, especially after they
were hopelessly beaten.

Defends Wilson Policies—Compares
Own Record On Progressivism
With McCumber
"Fighting for one's country is one
thing, and fighting for another man's
investment in a foreign country is
another matter" said John Burke,
United States treasurer, discussing
the Mexican situation in his political
address to an audience of about 500
people at the Armory Saturday even
ing, Oct. 28.
John Bruegger, former Democratic
national comimtteeman was chairman
of the meeting and introduced the
speakers. Charles Simon, candidate
for congress, preceded Mr. Burke and
gave a resume of the progressive
legislation enacted by tne present
administration.
Mr. Burke was one of the most pop
ular governors the state has ever nad,
and he was greeted with enthusiastic
applause when he rose to speak.
Tnruout his entire address, which last
ed nearly two hours, he held the close
attention of his audience while he dis
cussed in simple direct language the
questions of the campaign, outlined
the legislative achievements of- the
administration and presented his ar
guments in favor of re-electing Wil
son. Applause was frequent as time
after time he touched some point near
the hearts of his audience.
Complimenting Williston on its
gr^at progress since his last visit, Mr.
Burke said, in part: "North Dakota
is all good, but some parts are a lit
tle bit better than others. I am al
-wtys pleased to come to Williston
whether on a campaign tour or in a
lawsuit."
Commenting on the work done by
the administration, he said: "Even
tin Republican newspapers in theeast
4g&&it that it is an administration _of
great achievement in the way of con
structive beneficial legislation. The
president has kept Congress .in ses
sion nearly all the time he has been
President. I never knew another man
who had the same power to appeal to
the reason of men and make them see
that the thing he wants done is the
proper thing to do. It is on account
of this that we have all this beneficial
legislation. There is no blustering
about it, no waving of the big stick—
just the simple appeal to reason
which always brings results.
"The reserve banking la wis the
greatest constructive financial legisla
tion that we ever had in this country.
The old national bank act, enacted fifty
years ago, had no elasticity and was
not adequate to take care of the na
tion in times of prosperity although
it did very well when times were nor
mal. Under the new system we have
an elastic currency and such a condi
tion as we had in 1907 can never occur
again. This gives the merchant, the
farmer and banker a credit they never
had before.
ly interfere in competition that it
tends to create a monopoly.
"Much cf the legislation has been
for the benefit of the farmer. This
congress has eliminated the foot and
mouth disease and hog cholera and
has appropriated $50,000,000 for the
building of good roads. This affects
every citizen of the state and es
pecially the farmers of this state. A
great part of the cost of transporta
tion is between the farm and the ele
vator. Now it is not so much of a

CHAUTAUQUA FOR WILLISTON ASSURED
TYPICAL SCENE ON THE PROPOSED CHAUTAUQUA SITE
The committee representing the Community Lyceum Association, composed of T. M. Hutchinson.
Metzger, and Rev. James H. Batten, osed a contract with the Vawter Chautauqua Circuit for a five days pro
gram for Williston to be hel ddurin the middle or latter part of July. The committee conferred with the com
mercial club directors and a large number of, other business men of the ci y. The sentiment was unanimous for
a chautauqua for Williston and the program of attractions offered by Mr. Hedges, representing the Vawter
company, was satisfactory. An additional two days can be secured if desired. A large number of
business
men signed the guarantee required by the company.
Those who have taken the initiative consider that the most desirable location for the chautauqua grounds
will be at the natural park site on the south side of the Missouri, and it is probable that arrangements will be
made to that end.
Campaign For
Hospital Opens 9th
A new working agreement under
which they are to direct the campaign
for a hospital fund was offered by
Mrs. Currier at a general meeting
of those interested, held at the court
house Tuesday forenoon, and unani
mously endorsed.
Mrs. Currier, Mr. Currier, and
their two assistants are now engaged
in the preliminary work of the cam
paign. The work of soliciting will be
gin Thursday, November 9.
A conference of thirteen of the team
captains was held last evening. The
complete organization contemplates
the forming of twenty teams of five
or six members each.
YEAR'S VACATION
ENDS IN MONTANA
'BUCK" OLSON BROUGHT BACK
BY DEPUTY STROM—BROKE
JAIL YEAR AGO
Sheriff Erickson and his deputies
were well pleased when word came
from the authorities at Conrad, Mont.,
that Louis, alias "Buck" Olson had
been arrested in compliance with the
advertisements sent out by the Wil
liams county official. Axel Strom,
deputy, went to Conrad and return
ed with Olson Wednesday morning.
In July, 1915, Olson pleaded guilty
to a burglary committed at Ray and
was sentenced to one year in the peni
tentiary by Judge Fisk. While wait
ing for the transportation officer to
take him to Bismarck Olson escaped
through connivance with a boy on the
outside who learned where the cell
key was kept.
Cards were sent to many police and
county officers giving a description of
the missing man. One of the prin
cipal marks was a tattooed design on
the forearm reading: "To the mem
ory of my mother." This mark was
the cause of Olson's arrest. To Dep
uty Strom he stated that he traveled"
widely since his escape having been
as far east as New York city. He
said he expected ta'bv iricked up soon
er or later. Olson wiH be arraigned
again and may receive a longer sen
tence.

LIBRARIANS OF STATE HOLD
SUCCESSFUL ANNUAL CON
VENTION HERE
Visitors Enjoy Stay in City—Enter
tained By Ladies and Commercial
Club
The weather man, the hospitable
spirit of the Williston people and the
ability of the principal speakers ont
the program of the eleventh annual
convention of the State Library As
sociation all combined to make it both
pleasant and profitable. The dele
gates arrived on No. 3 Thursday af
ternoon and spent Thursday evening*
in informal conference over problema
common to all.
Friday morning the formal sessions
opened with an address of welcome
by E. R. Brownson, president of the
local board, who said that librarians
are much like central telephone offi
ces, connecting rich and poor, high
and low alike with the boolcs and in
formation they are in search of. He
also ranked the library with the*
school and the church as a strong
educational force in the community.
President Steele of Jamestown re
sponded with a brief history of the
whole library movement and said that
the mission of the modern library was
not to guard its book but to get them
used, to make every man and women
of any intelligence a reader of good
books. He offered as a motto for the
modern librarian the following re
solve: "I must yoke every book on
my shelf to some reader."
Mrs. Budlong, of the State Library
Commission at Bismarck, who said
she was used to "impersonating," took
the discussion of "Library Supplies"
in place of Mrs. McVeety of Fargo..
The consensus of opinion was that it.
was economy in the long run to buy
in large quantities as possible. Miss
Greene of the Minot Public Library
led the discussion of library recc- I.
and methods of simplifying. S/. I
factory methods :of doing .qece^sare
things with brief entries were well,
tested. The librarian's time is spent
to better advantage on books and peo
ple than on too many recorfls.
Mr. Steele gave a brief review of
the duties of a library trustee, limit
ing his activities largely to the finan
cial part of the library affairs. If a
satisfactory librarian is found the li
brary policy would better be left
largely in her hands.
Mrs. Budlong took up the discus
sion and said that a trustee's duties
were that and something more. The
library can be brought to the notice
and use of the public through five peo
ple better than through one alone, and
when the library board understand
what the librarian is trying to do they
can spread the influence wider than
she can by herself. Then, too, in
North Dakota the librarian is often:
isolated, professionally, and needs
the contact with others who have her
problems. The board should see that
the librarian attends the annual con
vention and, better still, that she is
accompanied by one of her board who
will profit by the larger understand
ing of library problems and possibili
ties.
Luncheon
At 12:30 the visiting librarians and
the local library board adjourned to
the Congregational Church basement
where a delightful luncheon was serv
ed to them by the Ladies' Aid. The
library board were the hosts to the
library association and to represen
tatives of the various civic organiza
tions and clubs of Williston. Yellow
and white were the colors used, and
the service was in the hands of white
gowned ladies with yellow aprons.
Following the luncheon were two?
short after-dinner talks, both excel
lent. Mrs. Budlong gave a brief
synopsis of the service rendered the
state by the Library Commission at
Bismarck, and Miss Drake of Sioux
City spoke on "The Library and the
Business Man." Test your library,
was her advice, and see if it isn't
ready to furnish you just the fact
you need to-day in your work. Her
description of the way in which the
Sioux City library has met the test
was both amusing and inspiring.
"Efficiency" is evidently her watch
word.
The afternoon program was devoted
largely to a report of good recent
books. A few novels were mentioned
but the reviews ran largely to psy
chology and biography, /or human
nature is certainly the most fascin
ating subject under the sun. Travel
came in for a share, especially books
about the West.
Rev. J. H. Batten very kindly con
sented to take over at the last min
ute the discussion of "The Library
and the Movies" and a lively inter
change of ideas followed as to how
such a powerful factor for uplift and'
education could be made worth while,
instead of a purely commercial affair.
A ride in the fresh air in automo
biles furnished by the commercial
club was very welcome, after a day
spent in continual discussion and the
visitors were deeply interested in the
pontoon bridge, the first that many
of them had ever seen.
Miss Drake's Address
The evening session of the conven
tion was attended by a number of in
terested townspeople and was per
haps the most delightful session of
all. Mrs. Jackson, accompanied by
Miss Jeannette Craven, opened the
program with a violin solo and was
neartily encored. Then Pres. Steele
