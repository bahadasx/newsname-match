broken up by a large Republican
meeting held on our streets. Can
didate Herrick and other candi
dates for lower offices, with a
large number of other eminent
men, came in an auto procession
of no small magnitude from Brad
ford, with some of the prominent
citizens of the city named, mak
ing an itinerary of the county,
and halted long enough to deliv
er us three speeches. Candidates
Russell andDeatdrt made the pre
liminary speeches and prepared
the audience to listen to Mr. Her
riek's most excellent and timely
talk, which was listened to with
rapt attention. The stay here
was of necessity short, and the
crowd coming as by magic, dif
persed in the same wiy. The
party went from here to Ver
sailles, thence to Yorkshire, Os
good and Ansonia, and coming to
a halt at Greenville, at which
place a lousing meeting wa3 held
that niiiht The speakers made
a good impression here, whi;:h
v. ill be voiced on the 7th of next
month when it will be known
who will be on top. At this junc
ture both parties are claiming
the election, and without making
any venture, for one I will abide
the verdict of the voters before
proclaiming thi result, which
will be more leliable than any
venture I or any one else ould
make. In concluding my last
week's item I made the predict
tion that a financial crash will re
sult shortly after the conclusion
of the European war, that the
prosperity now upon us is not due
t to, th Democratic tariff or policy
of that party, but due wholly to
the war and the nonproductive
ness of those belligerent nations.
But as soon as that , war ceases,
and the nonproducers return
home and to their usual avoca
tions, that soon demand for our
products will cease, and our
workers will fail to find work
and will become idle and our
country will become the dump
ing mart for foreign products
admitted under a revenue tariff,
unlessour tariff is changed to a
protective tariff, which will not
be done if the present incumbents
are kept in power.
The remains of C. B. Burns,
who, a few years ago ran
a grain market here, and at the
time of his death was in the same
business at Bowlesville in Clarke
county, were given burial in the
cemetery at this place last Thurs
day afternoon.

Horner,
Halloween stems to have been
duly celebrated, if plural celebra
tions count for arv thing. So far
we have had two rights of celej
bration, with some prospect for
a third tomorrow night. This
will surely be abundant, but it
may be asked jvhy not have such
celebration every right ' in the
year, except'when there is some
thing else, to divert attention?
The kiddies seem to enjoy the
fun, but I suppose the youngsters
are not capable of anything high

Astronomical Data for
November.
Venus will continue .as the
morning star during tne entire
month and may be seen shortly
before sunrise low down in the
southeast. Jupiter will continue
as by far the moet conspicuous
object in the evening sky and
will be well situated for observa
tion. Saturn will be a morning
object and crosses the meridian
high up toward the zenith about
5 in the morning. The principal
fixed btars visible during the
month are : Deneb, high up in
the west; ltair and Vega, low
down in the west ; Alpha Perseus
and Capella, well up in the north
east, with Aldebaran low down
near the horizon.
When examined through the
telescope, the planet Jupiter pre
sents a disk which is distinctly
flattened at the poles, so the ec
liptical shape is quite apparent.
This disk is crossed by several
dusky bands parallel to the plan
et's equator. These bands, or
belts as they are called, are irre
gular in outline and are continu
ally changing hi the details of
their configuration, tut are con
stant in their general appearance.
By observation of these mark
ings, astronomers have been en
abled to determine the period of
the planet's revolution on its axis
or the socalled Jovian day, which
is found to be about 9 hours and
55 minutes long. However, it
has bean discovered that the eq
uatorial regions revolve in a
shorter period than those near
the poles, so that the planet does
not revolve like a solid, all parts
of which must of necessity turn
round in the same length of time.
It would seem, therefore, as pro
bable that what we see of Jupi
ter is really the tops of an ever-
present envelope of intense clouds
and that the real surface of the
planet has never been seen.

For
In 1912 the Democratic paramount
issue was the promise to decrease the
cost of living .
Not only' has this not been done
but the increase in th cost of liv
ing in this country in the past year,

HOMES. Democrats cannot at once
claim credit for the "prosperity" pro
duced by the war and at the same
time escape responsibility for the in
creased cost of livuig by blaming
that upon the war. They should be
compelled to meet the issue, which
comes home to every citizen of this
republic.
Commodity prices for 1916, says
Bradstreet's financial review, issued
September 20th in New York are go
ing up at an unprecendented rate.
For the "whole country the price index
number, arrived at by totaling the
prices per hundred of 96 articles of
the most common use, was 11.7863

9.8034 for September 1, 1915, and
8.6566 for August 1, 1914. Practically
the same as on September 1, 1912.
In other words commodities which
cost 86V2 cents in 1914 and 98 cents
in 1915, now cost $1.18. Bradstreets
continues:
"It is interesting to note that the
breadstuffa group shows a rise of 42
per cent oyer last year, provisions
have risen 26 per cent, hide and
leather 21 per cent and textiles 33
per cent."
Those who go to buy shoes this
fall find that shoes that sold last
year for $2.50 are now $3.25 or more;
$5 shoes are $7 or more. Clothing
has gone up 25 per cent, and mer
chants are unable to get quotations
on clothes for delivery next spring
but another hoist of 25 per cent is ex
pected. Caiico, linen, poplin, broad
cloth, serges, canbric, have gone up
from 10 to 50 prr cent in price.
The worst feature of the foodstuff
situation ia that there is NOTHIN'J
CHEAP upon which the family may
subsist. Flour is from fifteen to
twenty per cent higher than at this
time last ye:::'. Dairy products are
up ene-third; potatoes are twice as

a year ago; beans have nearly dou
bled in price; fish prices have in
creased considerably; milk has been
increased in price in most communi
ties; lard is 40 per cent higher than
in September, 1915.
The Cleveland Press, a Woodrow
Wilson organ says: "Prices on near
ly all common articles of food have
been boosted in Cleveland this year
all the way from 41a to 157 per cent
over last year. One Cleveland au
thority says, "While it cost a family
of fiv; $1,000 to live last year, it will
cost $1,500 this yean a fifty per cent
increase, and most" of that higher
cost is in food. The man who could
last year support a family on $800
a year must earn from $1,100 to
$1,200 to do it now. Experts of the
Cleveland Federation for Charity and
Philanthropy estimate that the gen
eral increase in the cost of living in j
the last year has reached thirty perl
cent. Figures gathered by The Press
and printed in this article, also show
an average increase of about 30 per
cent. This covers 31 articles. This
means that where a man spent $1 a

Testimonial of Woodrow
Wilson's LOVE for Labor
WOODROW WILSON, while president of Princeton University,
was requested by Professor Frank Parsons, of the Bureau of Economic
Research, tx September, 1905. to join with others in. stynmz
this dtckrzxn
"1. We favor the eight-hour day.
"2. BeHeving that the eight-hour day means a longer and
richer life, a fair diffusion of wealth and power, a better
citizenship ani'a higher civilization through leisure for
edacfcisca, recreation, civic and social life, we welcome
each step & the progress of the eight-hour movement
and earnestly hope for the success of the Typographical
JLJntons in their efforts to secure the eight-hour day."
WOODROW WILSON refused to sign either of the proposiiim,
saying:
"It seems to me that nothing of this sort can be

cfssssa can be arrived at except by a resl dbcussioa cf
