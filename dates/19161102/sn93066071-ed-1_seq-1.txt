Heater Market Attracts Wheat From
North" I'lalM
O. A. Mlnton, a farmer who resides
ten miles northwest of Forgan,
marketed wheat In Heaver the past
week, receiving $1.82 per bushel, tho
market quotation hero that day.
which was seven cents higher than
was offered by the Forgan dealers.
Although Forgan dealers have the
advantage ot a shorter freight haul,
It appears that they are not able to
come up to the Beaver market prices
and the farmers, who want and are
entitled to tho highest dollar for
thel rproduco,, are passing up that
burg and marketing In Beaver where
highest market prices are being paid
all the time regardless of tho great
er freight haul and h'lgher freight
rate which must bonnet.

The high school students enjoyed
a' pleasant evening at tho Jilglt school
building Tuesday, at which time they
indulged In Hallowe'en fun. In addi
tion to the games and other amuse
ments, they roasted wienies nnd t
toasted marshmallows until a lute 1
hour. After tho party was over and I
the "school ma'ams" had returned
to their homes, the youngsters got to
gether and had some real fun as the
appearance of the business district
attested tho next morning, however,
the young people confined Iholr
pranks within tho bounds of reason
and their frolic was taken In good
nature by most of their victims. Their
chief stunt was to smear up the win
dows with soap. Wo feel like rising
up and culling them blessed for that
prank for It will no doubt cause some
windows, which have relt the need
of soap 'nnd water for months, to gel
a good cleaning. Nobody objects
to innocent fun, at this time, and we
want td congratulate the boys and
girls on confining themselves to fun
and not resorting to destruction of
property, as has sometimes been
dono tho past.
KHAZKR L1KKS WYOMING
A letter received last week from
W. C. Frazer, the pioneer abstracter
of this county, now located at Gil
lette, Wyoming, and In which was
enclosed a renewal ot subscription to
tho "best paper, published In tho best
section on earth, says: "It may In
tercst you to know that bIiico coming
hero, two years ago, my health has
been almost restored. We have much
pleasanter summers hero than there,
but tho winters are certainly much
COOLER. For instance, wo have a
u I co little snow on tho ground now
amounting to something like four
inches. Last winter It reached 27
degrees below here and at Sundance,
In the Black Hills, whero I spent
most of last winter, It was dovn to
30 degrees below."
Beaver friends will bo glad to
know of .Mr. Frazer's Improved
health. He still retains his Inter
est here and we need not bo surprised
to seo him drifting back this way
again somo day. They all come back
and the latch string Is out to you,
Mr. FraZur.

mora goods for their establishment.
Ilusiness has been so good In Ueaver
this fall that our merchants are flnd
1111? that their usual fall purchases
vare being depleted early and all are
having to restock. Tho string oi
wn rutin nnd cars constantly on our
s'treets from early morning till lato
at night attest of tho vast business
that is being done here. Reaver Is
a lively little burg theBO days.
it hub ueen urougm u uiu muni
tion that there are some who aro
killing stock and offering the meat
for salo without having the animal
Inspected, as provided by law. Tho
penalty for this is iou.uu. lienor
be careful.
George W. Hornell, of Kansas City,
was here the first of the week, com
ing over from Dombey Monday with
Represtntatlve H M. Drake, who was
hero looking arter political rences.
Mr. Hornell Is interested in the farm
loan business and was hero looking
after matters along that line.

TWO CARS IX TUN DITCH
Last week seemed to be "automO'
blip, accident day" In this section
Two cars wero reported to us as
meeting with mishaps, which, while
resulting In disaster to the cars, were
not serious so far as the occupants
wero concerned..
One of the victims was B. A. Pugh,
of hear Ilalko, who was driving home
from near Reaver Saturday night In
his Studebaker when he ran on a
bridge air the new state road, south
of R. C. Faln's farm, badly damaging
his car but escaping uninjured him
boU. Thero was no ono clso in the
car at tho time. It will be remem
bered that Mr. Pugh experienced a
big loss several months ago In a
similar accident when his son, Tad,
was driving their new Studebaker at
a good rate of speed, near their
home, and It skidded and turned tur
tle, the car being so badly damaged
that Mr. Pugh turned It In to the
company and took a now car tho
one which was In the smash-up Sat
urday night. This car, while con
siderably damaged,, can bo repaired.
Joe Foster, auto liveryman here,
was tho other smash-up victim, Mr.
Foster and W. W. Murray were re
turning from Forgan Friday night.
George Rrown, another liveryman,
was returning at the samo time. Af
ter crossing tho brldgo thoy speeded
up and raced toward town. Mr. Fos
ter's lights on his car wero not very
bright and he missed tho railroad
crossing, striking tho railroad track
full forco and turning a somersault,
car and all. Tho car was wrecked
but tho occupants escaped with hard
ly a scratch. It was a narrow escape
Wo fear out autolsts will have to ad
here a little moro closely to tho I
"Safety First" slogan or somebody I
Is going to bo fatally Injured. )
