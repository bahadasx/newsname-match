HOLIDAY CANDY
WILL COST HIGH
By Mabel Abbott
Holidays this year will lose
some of their sweetness.
Or else pay more for It.
The price of candy has gone
up, and probably will go still
higher, according to Tacoma man
ufacturers and dealers.
Confectioners' supplies of all
kinds have risen In price. Some
Tacoma dealers are meeting the
situation as to the fancy grades
of candies—the kind you send
your girl in a ribbon led box or
basket—by putting less In a box.
Others charge more for the pack
age.
A 50c box now sells lor 60c In
many stores.
But sadder still, tin- kind
of candy that Is used to fill
little stockings lias risen
from 10c a pound to 13c.
"And it won't be possible
to sell it for that very long,"
said a wholesaler today.
Sugar is $B.BR a barrel.
Borne flavoring and coloring
matters have doubled In price;
also are practically out of the
others cost five or ten times as
much as they did at the beginning
of the war.
Filberts and Imported walnuts
are unobtainable.
Java peanuts, which have con
stituted a large part of the supply,
market.
"Peanuts costs me more, any
way,' asserted the night engineer
of a Pacific avenue peanut-roast
er, aggrlevedly.
"Why shouldn't I chirge more
for 'em?" He would not admit
that he does, hut agreed that a
bag might hold less than former
ly.
"Supplies have risen so we
can't see them any more," was
the way a candy-maker expressed
the situation. Glucose has gone up
60 per cent; chocolate 20 per
cent.
"And"—here's a trade se
cret-— "Im*nzoate of soda, the
only pi-f--.*r\ bll\ » randy-mak
ers are allowed .'o use, has
risen from 40 rents a pound
to $10..V1. We only use about
six pounds a month, hut that
one item knocks more than
9600 v year out of our pro
fits.
"All prices on paper boxes have
been withdrawn and a flat raise
of 25 per cent made.
"About the only thing that
hasn't risen Is preserved fruits.
"We use the local brands, so
we don't have to worry about
them —yet."
