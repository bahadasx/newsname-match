unit," said the president, "in which no
slightest line of division is visible be

Outlines Policies
HE
INTENDS TO FOLLOW
ELECTED PRESIDENT .
IF
AT TERRE HAUTE, IND.
Declared That He Understood Union
Men Had Been Instructed to Vote
Against Him, But Believes No One
Can Control Labor Vote.
Terre Haute, Ind., Nov. 1. Charles
E. Hughes, speaking before an audi
ence that crowded every available' foot
of the big Wigwam here tonight, de
clared while he understood that union
labor had been told officially to vote
against him, 'he knew that nobody
could direct or control the labor vote
and that it would be cast according
to its sober judgment.
End of Campaign In Middle West
Mr. Hughes wound up his campaign
in the middle west with a speech here
tonight and left soon afterward for
points in New York, the last state in
which he will appear before election.
Mr. Hughes made five speeches to
day in which he outlined policies he
intends to follow if elected, assailed
the administration for the enactment
of the Underwood tariff and Adamson
law, and expressed the belief that he
would win. He spoke tonight before
an audience in the wigwam here after
reviewing a torchlight parade. Just
before his departure the nominee i&r
sued the following statement:
Wonderful Reception In Indiana.
"I am leaving Indiana after what is
perhaps the most wonderful reception
ever given a candidate for the presi
dency.
"This splendid tribute was not to
me personally but as the representa
tive of the great united republican
party moving forward to victory and
service for the nation. The men of
Indiana have organized a people's vie
tory and I want to thank the leaders
of the reunited republican party for
their effective work.
Speaks on the Tariff.
Mr. Hughes, on his final day in the
middle west, devoted much of his
speeches to the tariff. He addressed
two audiences at Linton and Brazil,
composed largely of employes of the
coal mining companies.
"We had souphouses and bread lines
twenty months ago, he told his au
dience at Linton, "and we will have
them again if we do not protect
American industry and if we attempt
to carry-on this business of this coun
try on the rwilicy indicated in the Un
derwood bill."
"When the war-orders end " he said
at Brazil, "under our present policy
as embodied in the Underwood bill
passed 4jy -r. opponents, you can lust
.see .yourself . going back to work., for
one ' or two or three days a Week.
That is what it means to you."
biscussed Adamson Bill.
In his speech here tonight Mr.
Hughes discussed the Adamson bill
at length.
"I am informed that the general
chairman has advised the local chair
man of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen and Engineers of the Penn
sylvania lines east that the Adamson
bill is establishing a new basis for
reckoning wages, will eliminate the
payment of-all arbitraries which are
based upon time made within the first
eight hour period of service.
Uncertainty of the Law. -
, "The uncertainty of the law is rec
ognized in various particulars. It is
said what jt will be decided to mean
no one can now tell, as it is possible
to construe it in several different ways.
The chairman also adds: "This law
does not change the' application of the
hours of service law. The company
still has the right to work you sixteen
hours within any 24 consecutive hours
if they do desire.'
ESfect of Adamson Law.
"I'note that the chief of one of the
locals of the brotherhood has ascer
tained the effect of the law on those
who complete their run in less than
eight hours. He says that if a man
makes a hundred mile run in five
hours instead of getting his full day's
pay he will get only five-eights of a
day's pay when paid on the eight hour
basis. He also says that formerly the
railroad men were entitled to pay for
25 miles whenever called out, whether
they were used after representing or
not. But the Adamson bill enacts a
flat basis of eight hours for the pur
pose of paying compensation, while
on the other hand it does not estab
lish an eight hour work day.
A Gold Brick for Labor.
"I think it will be found that the
Adamson bill is a gold brick for labor."
TALK OF SUBMARINE

1 German Embassy.
Washington, Nov. 1. Interest here
in the arrival of the German subma
rine merchantman Deutschland at
New London, Conn., on her second

retary of the Treasury McAdoo said

AN OBJECTIONABLE POSTER
Under Belief It Was a Reflection on
' the American Soldier.

ing that, a political poster set up on a
billboard in this city today was a re
flection on the American soldier, a
number of militiamen recently return
ed from the Mexican border and now
waiting to be mustered out, attempted
to tear it down today, but were pre
vented by the police-
The poster show's on one half an
American woman holding a drowned
child, and on the other the figure of
an American soldier lying on the
ground with Mexicans jabbing bayb
nets into him. The poster bears the
line "He has neglected me and mine,-'
and is a parody on a democratic cam
paign poster displayed about the city
to further President w llson s cam
paisn and which bears the inscription
"He has protected me and mine.
When the soldiers were warned
away they made inquiries of the re
publican and democratic, town chair
men to find out who was responsible
for the appearance and asked the
act.ing mayor and chief of police to
have "it removed. When they were
unsuccessful many of them declared
that the poster must be removed and
If it was not done by the authorities
it would be by other means. While
only a small number of militiamen, it
was said, were active in tne affair,
scores of others followed to look, on.
Previously an Indignation meeting
of the soldiers had been held in the
armory. The men claim that there is
no political bias in their attitude, as
there are differences of political belief
among them.

Bids for Four Scout
Cruisers are High
CONGRESS TO BE ASKED FOR
INCREASED APPROPRIATION
ONE DIRECT PROPOSAL
Electric Boat Company Submitted the
Most Comprehensive Estimate on
Submarines Awards Will be Mads
Only After a Detailed Study of Plans.
Washington, Nov. 1. Authority from
congress to raise the cost limit may
have to be sought by the navy depart
ment before it can award contracts '
for construction of the four 35 knot
scout cruisers in the 1917 building
program. Bids for the vessels were
opened today, with the result that oniy
one builder, the Seattle Construction
and Drydock company, offered e, di
rect proposal. This company bid
within the limit' of $5,000,000 for hull
and machinery, but it proposed to
construct only one boat.
Bids Based on Sliding Scale.
Two other bidders, the United Iron
works of San Francisco and the Fore
River company of Quincy, Mass., sub
mitted proposals based on a sliding
scale arrangement whicn would take
into account possible ' variations of
material and labor prices. The New
York Shipbuilding company gave no
tice that it could not give its estimates
within limit of costs.
May Delay Awarding Contracts.
It was indicated that the depart
ment might delay awarding contracts
until congress could be asked to in
crease the limit of cost 10 per cent, or
more. To undertake construction of
the cruisers in government yards, it
was said, would mean even greater
delay while the yards were being
equipped.
Bids for 27 Submarines Received.
Bids for 27 coast submarines and
two 800 Ion type fleet submersibles
also will be received today, and it is
virtually assured that all these ves
sels can be built by private contract.
Included amortK the offers was that
of Schneider A. company of Paris and
New. York, which presented three de
signs similar to those upon which
submersibles for the French and other
Kuropean governments have been
built. The company proposed to au
thorize the United States to construct
at its own yards as many boats on
these designs as it might desire on a
royalty basis.
Electric Boat Co. Offers Eight Pro
posals. The Electric Boat company submit
ted the most comprehensive estimates
on submarines, offering eight separate
proposals for boats of the coast type
and two ' propositions under which it
would construct one or both the 800
ton fleet submersibles. The nominal
limit of cost for the coast type boats
was set at $700,000 each, and the
Electric company submitted four al
ternative designs within that figure,
but requiring a time limit of 22
months for constructing. The other
four proposals were for the same de
signs, but based on a reduction of the
time of construction to 15 months or
thereabouts. These estimates ran
above the $700,000 figure, but the de
partment has authority to increase the
cost 20 per cent, in the interest of
speedy construction, and the four high
bids are within the maximum limit.
Lake Co. Figures Within the Limit.
The Lake Torpedo Boat company
bid for from six to ten coast type sub
mersibles and for one 800 ton boat.
The figures are all within the limit of
cost, but the designs are for a smaller
type of boat than those estimated for
in the Electric Boat company's pro
posals. Awards will be made only after a
detailed study of all the plans and
proposals.
CONFLICTING ELEMENTS IN
DESTRUCTION OF MARINA.
Much Essential to a Determination of
the Responsibility.
Washington, Nov. 1. So many con
flicting elements have appeared bo
far in the destruction of the British
ship Marina by a German submarine,
with loss of American lives, that the
incident threatens to fall into a tech
nical discussion rather than a clean
cut issue of whether Germany has
violated her pledges to the United
States.
It became quite apparent today,
both from the attitude of the state
department and from the despatches
from abroad, that much which is es
sential to a determination of the re
sponsibility remains undisclosed, if in
deed the United States, Germany or
Great Britain are in possession of th(
full facts.
It appears certain, however, that n$
move will be made by the United
States until the German version of
the affair, as well as that of the de
struction of the British ship Rowan
more by shell fire, with endangering
of Americans, has been obtained.
The only positive developments to
day were the action of Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador, in
asking his iTovernment to forward full
details by wireless, and the issuance
of a statement toy Secretary Lansing
that the investigation would be in
nowise delayed because there is a po
litical campaign in progress.
