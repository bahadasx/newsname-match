Resolutions Ask For Full AUendance
of Legal Taxpayers At Meeting
Next Wednesday to Discuss
Proposed Budget.
The proposed budget of school dis
trict No. One calls for the Installation
of a domestic science course in the
Heppner high school. The equip
ment of this course Including the
salary of an additional teacher will
cost the district as estimated in the
budget, $15,00 for the school year. At
a recent meeting of the Board the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, the Board of
Directors
have considered the advisability of
putttng in an additional course, name-
ly Domestic Science, for tho school
term of 1917 for District One; and
whereas the estimated expense of said
course is already included in the bud-
get for said term, the Board would
prefer that the legal taxpayers of said
district would turn out at the com
ing meeting on November 18th and
express their desire as to whether the
said course shall or shall not go into
operation.
The said Board would take it as a
favor if as many of the legal voters
as possible would turn out at the said
meeting and settle this matter either
for or against by a majority of their
vote.

JUDGE LOWELL
E
Eminent Jurist and Prominent Re
publican Will Address the Vo
ters of Morrow County In
Tills City Monday.
Hon. Stephen A. Lowell, well
known Pendleton attorney and one of
Oregon's leading statesman, will ad
dress the voters of Morrow county at
the opera house ln this city next Mon
day evening, speaking in the interest
of Chas. Evans Hughes, Republican
candidate for the presidency of the
United States.
This will be the grand final rally
of the local campaign of the Morrow
County Republican Central Commit
tee. In obtaining the use of the
theatre, the committee also arranged
with the management to give a free
program of pictures on this evening.
The pictures will be run both preced
ing and following Judge Lowell's ad
dress. All the Republican candi
dates for county office will be on the
platform with Judge Lowell and will
be given an opportunity to speak at
this time if they so desire.
Judge Lowell has been speaking
before large crowds In Umatilla coun
ty for several weeks past and he has
been very much ln demand. The lo
cal committee feels fortunate in be
ing able to secure him at this late
date on the eve of the election. Ar

Local Team Outplayed Wheat City
Boys and Won By 10 to O Score
Heppner Is Showing Improve
Ment. The Lexington high school foot
ball team lost its first game of the
season on their home grounds last
Saturday afternoon when they met
defeat at the hands of the Heppner
high pig skin warriors. The final
score was 10 to 0. This was Hepp-
ner's second game and first victory,
having lost to Ione two weeks ago by
the overwhelming score of 20 to 0.
Athough the Lexlngtonites were
outpayed. they were by no means out
fought. The end of the game found
the Wheat City boys fighting harder
than ever to make an impression on
the Heppner defense.
Heppner showed a world of im
provement over their playing against
Ione two weeks ago and the general
side-line prediction during Saturday's
game was to the effect that the husky
ex-Oregon center would have to keep
his boys going pretty lively Election
Day if he succeeded in keeping his
team on the long end of the scoring
line.
Many forward passes were attempt
ed by Heppner and some of them nett
ed good yardage. Lexington complet
ed one successful pass, Campbell to
Parker. End runs proved the best
yardage maker for Heppner and the
plays were worked In better shape by
far than the first game, when Hepp-
showed a woeful lack of interference
and team work.
Lexington has not got to going
good yet but they will be in a posi
tion to give Ione some good scrimage
practice next Saturday.

TO KEEP ROADS
Keeping good roads good is the
most important task in connection
with an improved highway system,
once the construction work is com
pleted. In the United States in the
past this task usually has been ne
glected, the Improved roads in many
nstances being allowed to deteriorate
until they become almost impassable,
when they were at heavy cost, rebuilt.
That States and counties are now
coming to recognize the need of care-
ul and .thoroughgoing .maintenance,
however, is indicated by studies of
country road systems in different sec
ions of the country recently made by
he Office of Public Roads and Rural
Engineering of the department.
While some of the eight counties In
which intensive studies were made
were found to have no provisions for
maintenance and others to pay for
upkeep of the roads out of bond-issue
funds, thus creating a debt that
would outlive the temporary Improve
ment by many years, two counties in
widely separated States were found in
which maintenance conditions were
practically all that could be desired.
In Mississippi, it was found, there is
a State law requiring that a special
annual tax of at least one mill shall
be levied for the upkeep of all roads
constructed by means of bond Issues,
the fund to be kept separate from all
other funds and to be used for main
tenance only. Instead of the deter
ioration taking place on the roads of
some of the counties in other states
on which examinations were made, it
was found that in Lauderale County,
Mississippi, roads built several years
ago and maintained from the special
tax have actually improved since their
completion.
The county roads of Franklin
County, N. Y., it was found, are main-
tained with a contribution of 50 per
cent by the State and under indirect
State supervision. As a result of this
system, the roads have been kept up
to their condition on completion.
While provisions for maintenance
were on the whole not satisfactory in
the counties of the other states ln
which studies were made, this condi
tion since has been remedied in Vir
ginia by the passage of a State law
providing that an annual tax of not
less than 3 per cent of the omount of
bonds Issued shall be levied to pro
vide a maintenance fund for bond-
built roads.
The existence of a regulation tend
ing to lessen damage to roads and so
to reduce maintenance costs was re
vealed by the studies in Spotsylvania
County, Va., where tTie county super
visors had passed an ordinance plac
ing a relatively low limit on loads
that may be hauled in wagons fitted
with narrow tires and a considerably
higher limit on loads for wide-tired
wagons. As a result, most of the wa
gons using the roads of the county
have been fitted with tires ranging
from 3 to 6 inches wide.

Democratic Nominee Leveled a Body
Blow at the Interests of Our Ag
ricultural Communities When at
the Behest of an Exclusive
Group of Railroad Workers
He Increased Their Pay
Without Investigating
the Justice of the
Demand.
Charles E. Hughes, who left Lin
coln for his second day's campaigning.
in Nebraska, told a crowd Of farmers'
in his speech here that the Demo
cratic Administration had Ignored the
agricultural interests . of the country
in urging the enactment of theAdam-!
son law. The nominee, in support .of .
his contention, cited a telegram from
President H. N. Pope of the Texas
Farmers' Union to President Wilson
requesting that the farmers be per
mitted to submit data in arbitration
proceedings between the railroads
and the brotherhoods. He said:
"I want to say in reference to rates
that, it seems to me the farmers of
the country were very little consid
ered the other day when on the de-
nand of the Administration the wages
of a group of railroad workers were
Increased by law, in response to force.
Somebody has got to pay the Increase
in bills, and the farmers will know
very quick who has to pay them.
"The farmers were not represented
in this discussion, If you may call It
that In this surrender. I have here
a copy of a telegram that was sent to
the President by Mr. Pope, the presi
dent of the State Farmers' Union of
Texas, which I shall read to you. '
"I want to say wamsonof.etaotnaoi
. "We ask that you make no con
cessions or commitments that will
in any manner cause, an Increase '
in freight rates on products pro
duced or consumed on the farm,
the men who pay the freight have
an equity in this dispute, which neith
er the railroad trainmen nor the
-ailroad managers have authority to
represent. If it Is your intention to
personally dispose of the matter we
ask that you postpone further con
sideration until a committee of farm
ers can prepare information and data
o present their side of the case. If
you conclude to settle by arbitration,
hen the organized farmers should
have representation on any arbitra
tion committee that may be formed
to dispose of this question; for the
men who pay should have representa
tion as well as the men who receive
it.
"We again urge that all questions
involved be settled by arbitration,
where all parties and all Interests can
be heard and the subject dealt with
aside from haste and intimidation
The crowd cheered when Mr.
Hughes concluded reading the tele
gram :
"No regard was paid to that mes
sage, Mr. Hughes said. rne dusi-
ness men of the country, through the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States, were at the same time and
had for many weeks before been Im
ploring the executive and leaders in
congress for an immediate and
prompt inquiry in order that the jus
tice of this matter might be known.
The farmers were not there except
through the presence of the repre
sentatives of the people in congress
and those representatives were asked
to abdicate their authority.
I am in favor of everything that
can reasonably be done for the pro
motion of agriculture. I am glad to
note the work of the Agricultural De
partment. It will be continued with
me, if I am intrusted with the power
to the utmost of efficiency under my
administration.
"But it is idle to talk of interest
in the farmer when you have action
like this taken in congress overnight,
against the protests of the farmer,
and levelling a body blow at the in
terests of our agricultural communi
ties." Mr. Hughes again denied the dec
laration that a vote for him "menat
a vote for war."
It is not his dignity that is keeping
Mr. Wilson out of the movies. The
trouble is that the moving picture
