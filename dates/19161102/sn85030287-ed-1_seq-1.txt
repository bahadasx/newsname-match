Examine Closely the Round Oak
Double Burner
And you will discover why it "burns smoke", why it
will hold the fire ovenight, not only the first year, but also
for a generation, why the ashes do not drop out onto the
floor when the ash pan is removed, why with its improved
grate construction it. will burn all fuels successfully.,
Consider The After Years
Bear in mind you are not buying a-heating stove for
a few months, or, possibly a year, but for many years, and
it is after the first year or two, that cheaper stove splay out.
The stove that will last a generation, thai will remain
absolutely air tight, is the one that you will determine your
final choice.
All we ask is that you examine this stove and give us
the opportunity of explaining why it serves you best.

Politics .vi. Education
Politics should in no way in
fluence a voter when it comes to
the matter of choosing educa
tional leaders. Nothing demor
alizes an educational system
more quickly than to permit po
litical domination. The office of
county superintendent should be
filled only by one who is thor
oughly qualified by training and
experience to direct the educa
tional development of the chil
dren of the county. A good
County Superintendent is one
who has a broad outlook upon
the field of education, and is
thoroughly in sympathy with
children.
Miss Kate Martin, candidate
for County Superintendent of
Meade County, has all the re
quisites of an efficient official to
direct the school system of the
county. She is thoroughly 'and
favorably known to the voters of
this county. She has had years
of experience, and is well
equipped educationally. She
knows the needs of the schools
of Meade county perhaps better
than any other citizen of this
county.
She also has had experience in
other states, having taught in
the schools of Indiana, both as
instructor in normal and as prin
cipal of schools. -
As a 'teacher .Miss Martin is
thorough in instruction and firm
in discipline. To her, school life
means SCHOOL WORK: , she I
will brook neither foolishness!
nor play. If elected to the office
to which she aspires, she will
carry into that office the same
thoroughness and discipline that
characterizes her work as a
teacher.
A vote for Miss Martin is a
vote for good schools.

A Word to the Voters
It has been a physical impos
sibility for me to interview any
considerable number of you rela
tive to my qandidacy, owing to
the fact that my time was occu
pied in preparation for the Octo
ber term of the District Court.!
As counsel representing you it
was up to me to prepare for trial
of a murder case, a case of wife
desertion, and two white slave
cases, and a case in which the
county was civily interested, be
sides my private practice, and,
take it from me, I had little time
to spare. And so I take this
method of announcing to one
and all that I want to be re-elect
ed to the office of County Attor
ney, and will appreciate your
support. 'K
It may not be amiss here to
say a word concerning the man
ner in which I have fulfilled my
duties during the past two yearK
During this time I have institut
ed and prosecuted twenty-eight
criminal cases. Among these
cases were murder, white slav
ery, rape, burglary, forgery, &nd
various misdemeanors, chief
among which were seven prose
cutions for violations of the pro
hibitory liquor law. Of these
twenty-eight cases I secured
a conviction in twenty-six
of them, and convicted each of
the seven bootleggers prosecut
ed. If this not law enforcement,
I leave it to the wisdom of the
people of Meade county -to say
what it is.
I have investigated every com
plaint made to me, and have
prosecuted vigorously every
case worthy of note where suf
ficient evidence could " be ob
tained; but I have declined to
bring cases so trivial as to pos
sess no real merit, and have been
forced to refrain from bringing
other cases of some importance
for lack of sufficient evidence.
By this means I have saved the
tax-payers hundreds of dollars
that an inexperienced or impru
dent County Attorney would
have squandered in futile litiga
tion. -
In addition to this court work
I have spent much time and en
ergy in advising and co-cperat-hi$r
with the County Commis
sioners and other officers of the
county whom the law requires
me to advise, and I have boon
free to counsel township and
.school district officers, and have
