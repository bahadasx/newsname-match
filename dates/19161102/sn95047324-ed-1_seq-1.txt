FAIRLY AND SQUARELY, THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

Cost of a Recount in ull the Coun
tiesof DeSoto County Alone
$1,044.00
Punta Gorda, October 30. In
the Knott-Catts controversery,
many claim that Knott should
have had the entire vote of the
State, recounted. Knott states
that his brother contributed $2,
500.00 towards the expenses of the
Recount. In every effort to Re
count, Catts, through his attor
neys, opposed such. In the great
County of DeSoto, there are thirty-six
"Precincts three inspectors
and one clerk in each precinct, to
tal one hundred and forty-four at
three dollars per day, $432.00.
Assuming that the average dis
tance of each is twenty miles from
the Courthouse, at ten cents a
mile, $288.00; ten cents a mile to
the. Sheriff for summons, $288.00.
Say twenty'-five cents for the
County Judge for issuing sum
mons. On such basis, the total
expense of a Recount for DeSoto
County is $1,044.00. There are 52
counties in Florida. They are, of
course not as large as. the great
County of DeSoto. There are ov
er 1,100 Precincts in Florida, av-
. e'raging over 21 Precincts to the
County, or about two thirds the
number of Precincts in DeSoto. It
is unreasonable to suppose that
"Knott could possibly have had all
the Precincts of the State, Re
counted. Besides in order to Re
cure a Writ of Mandamus, it is
neccssaryto show error or fraud
on the face of the returns or from
reliable testimony. " Such could
not have been done in all the
counties.
Arrangement of Tally Sheets,

phabetically, Gave Him Many
Erroneously Counted Ballots
Precinct No. 13 of Santa Rosa
Co., No. 23 of Marion Co, No.

tended for Him by the Voters?
Catts, the Counted-In Candidate
of the Inspectors
The tally sheets as returned by
the inspectors of the various pre
cincts are filed with the supervis
or of registration and with the
county judge of the respective
counties. They are public docu
ments r.nd as such are subject to
inspection. It is .natuiT.l to as
sume that some . friend of Knott
at some of the county seats ex
amined the tally sheets, as he had
a right to do.
The tally sheets are arranged as
follows :
At the top "first choice votes
names of candidates". Under
this column, come, alphabetically,
the names of Catts, Farris, Hud
son, Knott, Wood. In the hori
zontal column and at the top and
to the right of the heading of
"names of candidates" are "Sec
ond choice votes cast for Sidney
.). Catts" and so on in alphabeti
cal order, for Farris, Hudson,
Knott and Wood. Catts' second
choice votes come to the immedi
ate right of the names of candi
dates; first choice votes come im
mediately to the left of the names
of candidates. In each column of
second choice votes there is a
"dead" square in which no
second choice votes are to be
placed, because a .voter who votes
first choice for Catts, say, could
not cast his second choice vote
for Catts. For such second
choice vote there "is therefore a
crossed-out or dead square.
For instance, in precinct No. 13,
Santa Rosa county, the tally sheet
showed, as originally tallied, that
Farris received three first choice
votes. Knott ten, Wood eight,
Catts and Hudson none. Yet alL
the second choice votes were tal
lied in the vertical column head
ed "Second choice votes cast for
Sidney ,J. Catts". To the right of
Hudson's name and in the Catts
second choice column is marked 1,
although no first choice votes were
shown as having been voted for
Hudson. Yet, of the votes which
were cast for Hudson, first choice,
which was none, one second choice
vote is credited to Catts as coming
from the voter who voted first
choice for Hudson. A manifest
error. Of the ten first choice vot
es cast for Knott, four of these
are credited as having cast a sec
ond choice vote for Catts. Of the
eight first chtfice votes cast for
Wood six of those voters are cred
ited with having cast their second
jhoice vote for Catts. At the bot
tom of the Column eight second
choice votes are credited to Catts
without it being shown for whom
those voters cast their first choice
votes. These eight second choice
votes could not be counted at all.
Of the four second choice votes
credited to Catts and shown as
having been voted bv those who
voted for Knott first choice, they
could not, of course, have been
legally counted for Catts. The
inspectors by placing every sec
ond choice vote to the immediate
right of the name of every can
didate, inadvertently placed them
all in the Catts second choice col
umn. When the same inspectors,
and in the presence of the attor
neys and friends of both sides
recount them, it was shown that
not a single second choice vote
was cast for Catts and that Knott
gained 6 second choice votes,
Wood 8, Hudson 2 and Farris 1.
Can any reasonable man deny that
Knott should be entitled to have
the 6 second choice votes to which
he was entitled and that Catts
should be deprived of the second
choice votes to which he was not
entitled?
As the fight was between Knott
and Catts, the newspapers simply
stated the net gain of Knott with
out mentioning the other candi
dates, from which some people
claim it is " very strange" that
Knott was the only one to gain in
the recount. It will be observed
in that precinct, that Catts did not
receive any first choice votes in
either count. None of the inspec
tors were for him. This wa3 there
fore necessarily an unihtcntior.al
error. -
Add to precinct No. 23 of Mar
ion county, the same error occur
red, all of the second choice votes
are placed to the right of the
names of the candidates and in the
column headed "Second choice
votes cast for Sidney J. Catts."
As 41 first choice votes were cast,
it is not natural to presume that
all of the voters voted for Catts
either first or second choice. A
manifest error. The courts therc-
e i i .
lure uruereu a recount, the re
count shows that of the 16 first
choice votes cast for Knott, 3 of
these voters gave Catts their sec
ond choince votes and that of the
14 first choice votes cast for Catts
3 of them voted for Knott and 1
for Farris. Of course, neither of
these could be counted for Knott
or Catts, as they were the two
high men. Knott received 6 sec
ond choice votes from the voters
who voted first choice for Farris,
1 from the voter voting first choice
for Hudson, 1 from Wood's first
choice vote. "Wood gained 4 sec
ond choice votos. Knott 8, Hudson
1, Farris 6, Catts lost 11, a net gain
in Kott's favor as against Catts of
19 votes. Can any one say that
Knott was not entitled to this
gain? Can any one say that the
errors of the inspectors by which
Catts was erroneously "Counted
In" should not give place to the
wish of the voters themselves T 41
voted in this precinct. Knott's

net crain was 19. In the count of
June the 2Cth, Catts led Knott by
only 260 votes, including second
choice votcs.out of a total of about
85,000 first choice votes and about
60,000 second choice votes. Uut
of a total of about 135,000 first
and second choice votes, Catts led
Knott in first and second choice
voter by only 260. In this- one
precinct of 41 first choice votes
and 21 second choice votes Knott
gained 18 votes. , There are oyer
1,100 precinsts in Florida.
In precinct No. 47 of Hillsbor
ough county the same kind of er
ror was made, all -the .second
choice votes being placed immed
iately to the right of the names of
the candidates and in the second
choice, column of Catts. As 4 of
these votes came from the voters
who cast first choice for Knott,
they could not be counted for
Catts. - Catts received credit for
10 second choice votes. la the
recount, by the same inspectors,
Catts received 3 second choice vot
es which were cast by the voters
who voted their first choice for
Knott. Therefore, Catts lost in
the recount all of the second
choice votes originally credited to
him, 10; Knott gained 4, making
a net gain for Knott of 14; wood
gained 2, Farris 1, Hudson 2. Can
any one say that Knott was not
entitled to such votes? In other
counties the second choice votes
were placed in the dead squares
where it was impossible for any
one to tell for whom the voters
cast their fust choice votes. They
were therefore not counted. The
court very properly ordered a re-1
count in such precincts. In pre
cinct No. 20 of Suwannee county
and in the second-choice column
and in the dead square 6 second
choice votes -were credited to
Catts, 1 to Knott and 7 for Wood.
In the recount, Knott received 1
second choice vote from those who
voted first choice for Catts; and
Catts 2 from those who voted first
choice for Hudson, 1-from those
who voted first choice for Knott,
3 from those who voted first choice
for Wood. As second choice vot
es for Wood and Knott were cast
by the voters who voted first
choice for Catts,, their , second
choice vote did not, count. Cutis
gained 5 second choice vote,
none lost any first choice votes.
Catts was the only man that gain
ed any' votes. Can any one suy
that these 5 second choice voles
intended for Catts by the voters
should not be received bv him in
spite of the unintentional errors
by the insepctors?
Many more such errors could be
shown. As Knott received in the
first count 8,674 second choice vot
es to Catts 3,337, about two and
one half to one, Knott necessarily
gained more in the recount than
Catts. As Catts , second choice
vote, on account of alphabetical
arrengement, was placed licit to
the candidates, Catts received all
the benefits of the class of errors
heretofore shown in the case of
Santa Rosai, Hillsborough and
Marion counties. The inspectors
themselves said that such errors
were due to such. In the original
count, by which Caits was declar
ed the nominee through error
of the inspectors, was he not
"Counted-ln" as. the Inspectors'
Candidate? Giving to Knott the
votes of the people as they were
intended to be cast, is he not the
People's Candidate?
Who Stole the Only Ballot Box
Stolen and the Only Stolen
Ballots?
After Knott, through his attor
neys, had secured recounts and it
was evident that other, recounts
would be secured, the ballot box
of the Watertown" precinct, near
Lake City, was stolen. This pre
cinct was largely for Catts.
Through the theft of such no er
rors could be corrected. Catts
never tried to secure any recount.
It is quite evident that Knott's
friends did not fear an increase
for Catts, due to his securing a
recount, for he never tried to se
cure such. He was like the cat
which ate up the canary. He was
satisfied. Of course Catts did not
steal it himself, nor did he ask
any one to do so. Whose follow
ers stole that ballot box? I have
stated, which was published, that
this was done after a recount had
been ordered. It was done before
any recount was ordered. What
is the difference? The principle
is the same. No errors could be
corrected. Who stole the only
btllot box stolen?
I have seen a cut from a news
paper, and posted up, a picture
.showing Catts shaking hands
with a "delighted to meet you"
expression with a man marked
"the people's choice". Knott is
shown as running off to the capi
tal behind them with a valise
marked "ballot boxes" and with
a bundle under his arm. The nat
ural inference is that he is run
ning off with stolen ballots and
stolen ballot boxes. I have also
seen a picture of Knott marked
"The Court's Nominee for Gover
nor. Vote for Catts, the people's
choice".
In Glen St. Mary precinct," af
ter Kjjott had secured an order
ior a recount . to correct errors,
when the. inspectors assembled to
recount, all the ballots had been
stolen, .Who stole them? the
followers of the candidate who
went to the expense of secur'ng a
recount; expecting to gain votes
thereby or those, who, by stealing
them, prevented such a possible
gain?
Suwannee, Hamilton and Madison
Counties.
In the recount of precinct No.
12 of Suwannee county, Knott
gained from 45 first choice votes
of the first count to 57. P'ifty
seven voters swore they voted first
choice for Knott. Their names
are checked off as having voted.
The contest was dropped by Catts.
The inspectors admitted they got
puzzled and mixed up as to the
correct method of tallying the
sccoiyt choice vote.
A to Hamilton county, a man
swore he passed through the
court house square a certain night
and saw two men in the court
house with ballot box between
them etc. Another man was with
him. At'the time nothing was
said of the matter. This other
man swore he could not swear as
to such ballot box or as to the
counting of ballots. The twplnen
in the court house, one the clerk
of the court and the other an au
ditor swore they were checking
up stubs, auditing the books,
there being an adding machine.
The lights were on in the room,
shades up, nothing private. The
court declared the evidence did
not justify fraud.
In the Greenville, precinct of
Madison county, although more
swore they voted for Knott first
choice than were credited to
Knott, Knott asked-that the re
count of Madison county be
thrown out, as he did not want
any ballots shadowed with taint
c e .1
Ul 1IHUU. ,
The 69 Votes of Alachua County
Catts, the First to Ask the
Court for a Mandamus to prop
erly have Votes Countel.
Much meowing is done by the
Catts contingent over the failure
to count the sixty-nine votes of
Alachua precinct, in Alachua
county. The first tally sheets
showed that the inspectors had
failed to sign their names to the
tally sheets. They were required
to swear to the correctness of the
returns. They were omitted by
county canvassing board of A-1
lachua county. Catts attorneys on
two occasions proceeded to secure
a mandaums to have them recount
ed.. In each instance, they them
selves withdrew their request for
an order of the court to have them
counted. Catts was the first candi
date to wish- the aid of the courts.
When the case was up for consid
eration before the supreme court,
the chief attorney for Catts re
quested an order that they bo
counted. As the circuit court for
Alachua county had issued a man
damus requiring a recount of all
the votes of Alachua county the
supreme court, very properly, re
fused to take action. In the re
count of Alachua county, these
votes were given to Catts and
Knott credited with sixteen votes
erroneously omitted from his vote
in the original tally sheets, giving
Catts a net gain of 53 votes. As
Knott had already on file with the
state canvassing board , fully
twenty more votes than these 53
votes which Catts had gained, the
supreme court very properly re
fused to order that these addition
al votes be recountel by the state
canvassing board, inasmuch as
the said recount would not affect
the result. In other words such
a recount would only increase
Knott's lead by about twenty vot
es. Anything unfair about this?
The So-Called Court Candidate
12 of the 13 Circuit Court Judg
es, Who were Asked and the 5
Justices of the Supreme Court
17 out of 18 Judges Order
ed Recounts - Are they . all .
Scoundrels? Case of Kehoe
and Mays, 1903.
Of the thirteen circuit judges in
Florida," twelve were asked by
Knott to order recounts. Every
one ordered recounts.. In one
precinct, alone, Putnam county,
the supreme court ordered a re
count. If I mistake not that was
a case in which the second choice
votes were tallied in the dead
squares. Before these judges are
legally tried all manner of rights
of persons and rights of property.
Are those 17 judges unworthy of
belief because they followed the
law and because as a result of the
law and the facts Catts lost some
votes which were erroneously
credited to him, and the people,
through Knott, secured the votea
which they cast for Knott?
In the case of Mayes and Ke
hoe, 1908, each being a candidate
for Democratic, nominee for Con
gress, the original tally showed
Kehoe to be in the lead. Through
mandamus proceedings by the su
preme court, certain votes were
counted and Mayes was declared
the nominee. .
It has been an unbroken prec
edent of the Supreme Court of
Florida to use a writ of mandamus
in requiring officers to perform
their duty. In this case neither
Catts nor Knott were officers. The
inspectors were. If eithp ' -no oi
them had been officers, quo war
ranto proceedings would have
been, undoubtedly applied, caus
ing them to show by what war
rant they held the office. In these
Court proceedings, it was a ques
tion of issuing a mandate to the
officers to perform their duty.
Would .any one have had respect
for the courts, if they had chang
ed their rules of action simply be
cause the proper performance of
duty by the inspectors would in
jure one or the other candidates?
In a recent speech at Tamrm. Catts
stated substantially that if elected
governor, he would endeavor to
have passed a measure for the re
call of the members of the Su
preme Court. Quite a threat.
