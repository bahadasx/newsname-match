AMERICANS IN
EUROPEANWAR
EXPATRIATED
Refusal of State Department of
Passport to Theodore Mar
burg, Jr., Brings Out Faots.
OATH CHANGES CITIZENSHIP
Ruling Put in Effect Refusing
Papers to All U. S. Subjects
Des'ring to Enter Conflict.
Refusal on tho part of tho State De
partment to grant n passport to Thoo
doro Marburg, jr., of Baltimore son of
tho former American minister to Bel
slum, to return to England and resume
his duties with tho British Royal AvfW
Uon Corps, brought out tho fact today
that all Americans Hghtlng abroad In
tho armies of Europe who havo taken
oaths of alleKlanco to tho countries they
are Bcrvlng, havo automatically becomo
expatriated.
This Is held by tho department to be
particularly truo of those serving in
the British army, which requires an
oath which, In tho Judgment of depart
ment officials, completely wipes out all
alleglanco to tho United States.
Moreover, the department has put into
effect a ruling under which and under
no circumstances will it grant a pass
port to an American desiring to go to
Ehirope for the purpose of lighting on
on aldo or the other In tho war.
French Oath Elastic '
Whllo It is believed that tho oath re
quired of members of tho Foreign
Legion In tho French army Is more
elastic than that of Orcat Britain, the
burden will rest upon all American
members of that legion tq provo that
they have not becomo expatriated.
Even after peaco is declared, it is
stated at tho department, men who
havo served In tho armies abroad, with
th poBslblo exception of those serving
la tho French army, will not bo granted
passports to travel abroad as American
, citizens, and thoso who may return to
thlir'country in destltuto circumstances
after the war would bo treated as ordi
nary alien Immigrants subject to de
portation It without relatives In this
oountry to support them, or without
means of livelihood or If suffering from
contagious diseases.
Sister Says Ho Will Sail.
Regardless of young Marburg's
plight, his slater. Madame Starkon-bourgh-Stackouwer,
wife of the boc
retary of tho Netherlands Legation,
declares that ho will sail from New
York next Saturday on a Dutch stoam
or. relying on his papors us a British
offlcor to guaranteo him entry Into
Great Britain.
In view of the great number of
Americans now serving conspicuously
In the aviation corps of the French
army, the Htato Department, It was
learned today, hus found It advisable
to suggest to tho French Mtovernmont
that it discontinue to refer to the
American aviators as members of tho
American Corps, owing to the falro
light In which Buch referonces placo
the United .States as a neutral nation.

Car Service Order
Not to Be Rescinded,
Says Head of Board
Utilities Officials Explain Standard Doesn't Mean
Actual Seven Square Feet of Standing Room,
But That Average on AH Cars.
More Vehicles on Lines.
The Public Utilities Commission has
no Intention of rescinding tho order
standardising street railway service
In tho District, according to a state
ment today of Col. Charles W. Kuti,
chairman.
It is tho belief of officials that there
Is a popular misconception of the regu
lations which went Into effect yester
day. Tho order docs not mean that
every passenger boarding a car during
rush hours must havo seven square feet
of standing space.
Tho public cannot be prevented from
crowding If It feels so Inclined. If Mrs.
Smith and tho seven little Smiths Insist
on getting on a car loaded to Its
theoretical "carrying valuo" tho con
ductor Is not going to try to prevent her.
Service Must Meet Average.
It does mean that tho companies are
required to furnish sufficient cars to
provide an average aervico which meets
this requirement during tho rush
period, extending from 6:30 to 9:15 a. ni.
on midweek days and Saturdays, and
from 3:45 p. m. to 6:30 p. m. on midweek

Marina Case Brings in New
Complications, Secretary
Lansing Indicates.
Reopening of tho entire armed mer
chantmen controversy between this
Government and Germany is certain if
It Is proved the British steamer Marina
was armed at tho tlmo sho was sunk by
a Gorman submarine, statements of
Secretary Lansing indicated today.
Whether merchantmen havo a right
to arm for defense Is still an open ques
tion between this Government and Ger
many, Lansing admitted. This question
will be tho, principal ono if negotiations
deyclop with Germany over tho death
of six Americans on board the vessel.
It was stated.
Whllo this Government has main
tained tho right of merchantmen to
arm for defenso, Germany has never
admitted It.
Arose Over Lusltanla.
The question first aroso when the
Lusltanla was sunk. This Government
has Insisted that merchantmen may
arm with any guns not over six inches
In caliber. When discussion of this
point aroso during tho Lusltanla ne
gotiation, this Government showed
tho Lusltanla was unarmed. Without
a recession by this Government from
Its position or an admission by Ger
many that merchantmen might arm,
tho question was permitted to lapse.
Secretary Lansing said that the right
of merchantmen to arm Is still a moot
ed question; that theru has been no
decision on It.
Germany Is expected to maintain that
armed merchantmen were not included
In her pledges to the United States.
There has been no chnngp In this
Government's contention. Secretary

FORCED
DN TRIP TO
Victor Carlstrom Obl'ged to Stop
at Erie on Account of Engine
Trouble.
ERIE, Pa.. Nov. 2.-Vlctor Carlstrom.
the Now York Times aviator, was
forced to land here at 11:53 on his
flight from Chicago to New York, on
account of engine trouble.
Ho descended In the outskirts of the
city, but was expected to take to the
air ugaln soon.
Carlstrom's actual flying time was
four hours and sixteen minutes from
Chicago, covering tho distance of ap
proximately 150 miles In the average
tlmo of 109 miles an hour. Ho left
Chicago at 6:09 n. in.
Desplto the fact that ho descended ho
established a new American non-stop
record, tho previous best being his
own flight of 410 miles from Newport
News to Now York.
Tank Was Leaking;.
Carlstrom had passed six miles south
of tho city when he discovered that
his gasolene tank had been leaking.
Ho turned and made tho landing at
Erie.
Carlstrom said that he has given
up hope of reaching New York city
before night. He had traveled from
Chicago believing thut the 200 gallons
of gasolene would be enough to carry
him through, but when he discovered
tho leak, ho did not know how much
farther he could go so decided to turn
back nnd land.
Carlstrom is carrying letters from
Mayor Thompson to President Wilson,
Governor Whitman, and Governor
Dunne to Governor Whitman, and the
New 'York Times; MaJ. Gen. Thomas D.
Harry to MaJ. en. Leonard Wood; B. J.
Arnold to Thomas A. Edison; Associa
tion of Commerce to tho Merchants' As
sociation of Now York: Postmaster
Campbell to Postmaster General Burle
son, und cards of greeting to tho Kaiser
and German officials and newspapers to
be Bent via the Dcutschland, merchant
submarine, when it departs, for Ger
many. New World Record.
If Carlstrom had succeeded In reach
ing Now York without making a stop
ho would havo established a new
record for continuous flight In an
aoroplane. The previous record was
made Juno 20-21 of this year by Sub
Lieutenant Marshal, of tho French
nlr service, when he new from Nnncy,
over Berlin, and landed In Austrian
Poland, Ho covered more than 800
miles. Tho distance from Now York
to Chicago by Carlstrom's route Is
approximately 900 miles.
Tho night between tho two cities
has been attempted boforc, whon
Eugene B, Ely made an effort to win
tho New York Times and Chicago
Evening Post prize of J25.000, and
$5,000 offered by Clifford U. Harmon.
He was forced to doscond after cov
ering about thirty-two miles. Ely was
killed somo tlmo lator.
On May 21 of this year Carlstrom es
tablished his former American record
for a non-stop (light, traveling from
Newport News to New York, a distance
of 410 miles.

Tho legal rate of 4 francs a klloxinm
