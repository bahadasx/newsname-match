Disastrous Blaze Wipes Out
Business Houses at Kathryn
The fire demon broke loose at Kath
ryn Friday evening at about 9:30 and
several of the most important busi
ness buildings went up in smoke.
Among them the Sheyenne Valley
bank, the Thoreson-Runck general
«tore, the Larson hardware and the
•drug store and telephone exchange lo
cated in the drug store.
The fire is supposed to have started
somewhere about the store room or
the upstairs of the Thoreson-Runck
building. Owing to the lack of ade
quate fire protection the buildings
were entirely consumed. How much
of the stocks and fixtures were sav
ed cannot be learned at this time on
account of the lack of telephone com
munication.
The village had been preparing for
better fire protection by having an
artesian well sunk, but the piping to
the business section had not been
completed.
The amount of insurance carried
could not be learned, but it is sup
posed to be about what is usually car
ried. There is nothing to be said yet
in regard to rebuilding, but there is
every reason to believe this section of
the town .will profit by having brick
and concrete buildings to replace
those destroyed.
A conservative estimate places the
loss around $50,000.
Dakota Drug Co. Now
Installing New Machine
The new enlarging machine in the
Dakota Drug Co.'s window is attract
ing attention these days. They have
been trying to get this machine for
a year, but owing to the powerful
lenses needed have been unable to get
it before. The machine will be in
stalled in a few days and will make
any size enlargements from the small
est of negatives. Getting it this time
of year, the enlargement of a favor
ite or pet negative makes a very suit
able Xmas gift for a friend. After the
new machine is installed, the Dakota
Drug Co. expect to show in their
win­|they
dows samples of the work done. That
branch of their .business has develop
ed wonderfully, and they are now em
ploying two people in that depart
ment alone, doing a big mail order
business from within this state and
surrounding states, Illinois, Iowa an»i
California contributing.
Funston Reviews Mm
of Dakota's Regiment
Fargo Forum: "General Frederick
Funston was at Llano Grande and re
viewed our division and it sure was a
sight for most of our boys, the num
ber of troops totaling over 10,000 men,"
says Lieut. R. Colley, of Company
First North Dakota Infantry, writing
to the Forum from Mercedes, Texas.
"We marched over to Llano Grande
to take our part in the review. There
were nine regiments of infantry, sev
eral batteries of artillery, quite a lot
of cavalry and also hospital com
panies, machine-gun companies and
signal corps.
"We have been kept busy with com
pany and battalion tests during the
last few weeks and I may say the re
sults are proving very creditable for
the First North Dakota.
"Yesterday we had a big division
hike of about six miles which gave us
an opportunity to see our division
march in heavy marching order.
"We were given a demonstration of
the fine shape our men are in last
week in our company tests, when eacih
company marched about 4% miles in
from 50 to 58. minutes. No men fell
out of this forced march and they were
all in good condition when they got
back to camp. This was done in heavy
marching order.
"The 'Second North Dakota,' con
sisting of five men recruiting from the
state, arrived in camp, and company
was lucky enough to get a fifth of the
recruits, i. e., one man. They have
already attained fame, as Sergt. Ed.
Peterson has composed a poem in
their honor.
"The weather is ideal down here.
The nights are beautiful and moon
light and very cool for sleeping. The
days are also reasonable, and while it
is quite warm yet, it does not tire
one out so much.
"Last Thursday we had one of
Texas' celebrated northers. Wednes
day was extremely warm and sultry
but during the night a north wind
sprang up and the temperature drop
ped from 95 degrees to 45 degrees in
a very f©w minutes. Consequently
everybody was glad to wear a sweater
on Thursday.
"The change in temperature had a
noticable effect on the men. They
displayed more 'pep' and by Thursday
evening several young football teams
were in operation and lame backs and
'Charley' horses' are now the rage.
"On account of some cases of para
typhoid we received our first 'shot

NOLTIMIER FESTIVAL
A BIG SUCCESS
On Friday evening Noltimier town
ship staged its second fair and harvest
festival«. The only hitch in the
whole event was that the crowd was
so large that a good many were forced
I to stand up in the halls during the pro
gram.
The agricultural and home products
displays were exceptionally good, far
better than last year. Ten prizes in
cash were given. The first prize of $5
went to Miss Esther Koenig the sec

Special mention must be made of
the chicken and duck displays. Ev
ery chicken and every duck was pure
ibred. There were total of ten ex
hibits in this line.
The manual training and school sew
ing and crocheting displays deserve
special mention.
Marvin Montgomery and Clarence
Bruns exhibited Scotch collies.

come.
This fair is a concrete example of
what consolidation will do for any dis
trict.

VALLEY CITY NORMAL
SUES SCHOOL BOARD
Bisbarck Tribune, Oct. 27.—The
Valley City Normal has a claim of
$1,000 against the board of education
of Valley City for the tuition of 150
city children who attended the Nor
mal's model training school last year.
The board of education refuses to hon
or the claim, on the grounds that the
pupils attended the Normal school
without obtaining permission from the
board or other proper authority. The
board of regents has asked the attor
ney general to institute action for the
Normal and suit will be filed in the
Barnes county district court against
the Valley City board of education.
The 1915 legislature provided that
in towns where Normal schools are
established city pupils may attend the
Normal training school, and the board
of education shall pay $2 per month
for each pupil who takes advantage of
the model school. Last year 150 Val

Normal school. When a bill, approxi

evening when a Ford auto of the Mar^

and Ben Froemke and Arthur Hansen,
driver, went over an embankment,
turning completely over. Mesdames
Booth and Halvorson were returning
to Valley City and when about ten
miles north of Hastings they met a
car coming from the opposite direc
tion. They were on a high embank
men, and in trying to make room for
the other car to pass, came too near
the edge with the result that the car
topped over. The light on the car
coming towards them blinded the
driver, and the road is very narrow
at this place, not wide enough for two
cars to pass. Mrs. Booth suffered a
broken collar bone, Mrs. Halvorson
was uninjured, while Messrs. Froemke
and Hansen both suffered minor in

BANK OF VALLEY CITY
Voters to Be Greeted
With Ballot Shower
When the festive voter sallies forth
on electiion day to cast his vote, or
votes, he will be handed a collection
of ballots by the judge of election.
The collection consists of five ballots
which range in size from the little
nonpartisan school ballot 4x10 up to
the regular blanket affair which meas
ures 15x36.
On the large ballot is found four
columns, one each for the republican
nominees, democratic, socialist and
individual nominations. There is the
referendum ballot containing two
propositions, repeal of mill tax for ter
minal elevators, and definition of
crime of bootlegging. The amend
ment ballot provides for voting on es
tablishing a normal school at Dickin
son, and for a second state hospital
for the insane. There is a nonpar
tisan judiciary ballot and nonpartisan
school ballot for the men and a non
partisan school ballot for women vot
ers.
The county auditor of Barnes coun
ty has prepared ballots to accommo
date 32,000 voters. It requires about
a ton and a half of paper for the bal
lots of this county. At the present
price of paper the bill for the ballots
required for the whole state will
amount to a tidy sum. For the whole
country an enormous sum.
TAX PENALTY ATTACHES NOV. 1
Nov. 1 an additional three per cent
penalty will be added to delinquent
taxes, totaling a ten per cent penalty
for unpaid assessments levied for 1915.
If the delinquen: taxes are not paid
before the second Tuesday in Novem
ber, the real estate will be offered for
sale to recover the tax and expense
incurred.
The personal property, taxes have
been turned over to Sheriff Kelly for
collection. These taxes will be col

levy will include a penalty and col

board of education for their tuition,
the latter refused to pay, claiming that
it had no knowledge of this number
of pupils attending the Normal school
that full provision had been made in
the city schools for the education of
these boys and girls that no decrease
in expense had been made possible
through the attendance of these young
sters at the Normal school, and that
the payment of the $2 per month tui
tion fee would result in levying a
double tax upon the school district
for one service.
The law is silent upon these points.
It requires no notification of fir per
mission from the local board of edu
cation. It merely decrees that the
board shall pay a fixed sum for every
pupil who chooses to attend the Nor
mal. No other Normal-town board of
education has yet contested payment,
and the case will attract interest
throughout the state.
One Cent Sale Was
Biggest Ever Held
The Dakota Drug company reports
that their one-cent sale of Friday and
Saturday was a remarkable success,
the biggest they have ever had, and
that Times-Record advertising was re
sponsible for its success.
One of the leaders in the amount of
goods sold was the coffee and tea at
one cent a pound. This was a new
venture for this energetic firm and a
new line for drug stores in this part
of the country, although drug stores
in larger cities of the east have sold
them for years. When Mr. Sigurdson
told us about the amount he had on
hand of these two items it seemed to
us almost fabulous, but today he tells
us that it was sold out entirely by 10
o'clock Saturday morning and that if
they had had it they could have sold
three times the amount they had.
They assure us, however, 'that they'
will not get caught that way on their
next sale.

Death of Young Man's
Father Hastens Wedding
Monday afternoon at 3:30 Floyd Er

marriage by the Rev. Willard Crosby
Lyon at the Congregational parsonage.
The bride is a daughter of Mr. and

nephew of Mr. Claspell, of Oriska. In
spite of the joy that always attends
the uniting of two young lives there
was unusual sadness on this occasion
due to the fact of Mr. Drake having
received that morning word of the
sudden death of his father in Indiana.
The wedding had been planned for
next week and the young people were
going to live on the old homestead in
the southeastern part of Indiana. They
left last night on No. 2.

RECRUITING UNDER WAY
AT NEW ROCKFORD NOW
New Rockford, Oct. 28.—Captain
Solum, of Company F, Mandan, and
Corporal Robert Dinehart, of Company
H, Jamestown, are in the city to try
to arrange for the recruiting of a
number of additions to the First in
fantry of the state. They want to se
cure about 20 men down to the border
and gain military experience so they
can come home from this city and
have them go and assist in the organ
izing of a company for this city.
North Dakota will have to furnish
two additional regiments, and this
will give a number of towns the op
portunity of having a company of
their own and they believe that this
city should have one of them. They
think some of the young men should
enlist now and get some practical
experience before the company is
formed.
Capt. Salum was in Mercedes, Ter.,
and he says the condition of the
North Dakota troops there was ideal
and there was not a case of typhoid
fever during the entire time they
were there. He is the democratic
candidate for secretary of state in
the fall election -and his absence at
the border hs interfered with his
campaign.
