WORTHY OF APPRECIATION. j|
Help the Man Who Shows He lie-,
serves It. ; ^
The November Woman's Homei
Companion prints an editorial about
a man who wrote a letter praising a i
young railroad man. It says: j
"A busy New York man returned
last summer from his country home.
The statioh agent in that little country
town had been particularly helpful
to him. in caring for his trunks I ,
and arranging for the comfort of his i
family.
"The New York man was grateful j
to the station agent. He told him so. j
He wondered, as he rode along whatl
chance the young fellow had in that1 '
country station. Would any officer <
of the road ever pass that way? :
Would the lad's willingness and efficiency
ever gain him a reward?
"When he reached his office he ]
wrote a letter to me presiueiu oi uiai i
railroad. 'I want to congratulate
you on the young man who represents
you at Smithton,' he said; 'he |
is courteous and intelligent, and the ,
good will that he secures for your j
road in that section is worth real
money to you. He is a young chap
worth watching.'
"A little thing it was. The cost
was only a few minutes of a stenog- ,
rapher's time and a 2-cent stamp.
Yet that letter stood out like a diamond
on the president's desk amid 1
the bundle of querulous complaints. '
It brightened the day in that big of- 1
See. It may have changed the whole '
career of the young chap in the country
depot."
Alabama Mules in Europe. 1
n <
The Age-Herald says 10,000 mules
and horses have been shipped from j
Birmingham to Europe for service in (
Mr. G. W. Mcintosh will leave this
week for Williamsport, Pa., where he
will celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary.
Clear Pond News. ,
Clear Pond, Oct. 31.?Quite a number
of folks from here attended the
Union meeting at Spring Branch Saturday
and Sunday.
Miss Ellen Bellinger, of Texas,
spent last week here with relatives j
and friends.
Mrs. C. H. Sandifer and children
are visiting her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
G. W. Folk.
Mr. C. E. Hughes, of Varnville, is
spending some time at the home of
Mr. P. K. Hughes.
Mrs. R. F. McMillan visited in
Bamberg last week.
Mrs. Kistler Rentz, of Ehrhardt,
visited her brother, Mr. P. K. Hughes,
last week.
Mesdaipes S. M. Brown, and J. F.
Morris, of Ehrhardt, were visitors at
Mrs. J. J. Hughes's last Monday.
Mr. G. W. Folk left Sunday for a
few days' stay with his son at Hilda. I
Mr. and Mrs. Manford DuBois and;
children are expected home in a few i
days after an extended visit to rel-j
atives in the county.
Mr. Shelly Padgett, of Govan, is
the guest of Mr. O. L. Tant.
the war. Birmingham has received
over $1,000,000 from this traffic. It ,
is estimated that upwards of 800,000
mules and horses have gone from this
country to Europe. Over $100,000,000
have been involved in the sales
gf these animals.
The mule that goes to the war will
live about two weeks on an average.
In 1915 there were about 25,000,000
mules and horses in this country,*
there were less than 5,000,000 '
mules. For several years mules and 1
horses have been expensive. They 1
have been fco costly in fact that even ;
in times of peace it was considered
sound economics to raise mule colts j
and horses for sale.
It's a mighty poor mule that ^
brings less than $200 on the market.
And it doesn't cost much to raise a
few colts. Prices in future will be^1
very high.
Can't you find room for the advent i
ofp colt or two a year on your farm? 1

Price of Spangles Soars.
The demand for beads and spangles
this season is the heaviest leading
factor in the trade ever seen, but
goods are about the scarcest they
have ever been. Steel beads are particularly
in demand, and they are so
hard to get that prices have advanced
on them from 7 cents a small bunch
to 19 cents or more. Cut steel beads
are especially scarce, being in demand
for trimmings on shoes, dresses,
hats, gowns and other wearing
apparel and on velvet and crocheted
bags. '
Seed beads in all colors, some 300
shades in all, are also much called
for, many of the colors being hard to
get now. Oriental and French pearl
beads are much wanted for use in
necklaces. The spangles, jet and
irridescent effects are in heavy demand
for use on party dresses.
Prices on all kinds of beads now average
25 to 30 per cent, higher than
normal.?Boston Transcript.

AX IMPORTANT WORK.
Plans Being Made for Distribution of
Immigrants After War.
v.
The suggestion recently was made
to officials in Washington that some
organized effort should be made by
the government to distribute the immigrants
who come to this country
after the war in Europe, says Thomas
F. Logan, in Leslie's. It was pointed
out that there are a large number
of farms in Vermont and New Hampshire
and other Eastern States, as
well as many other sections, and especially
in the South and on the Pacific
coast, which are now vacant or
can be bought on easy terms. This
is a laree factor in the develoDment
of the financial prosperity of the
United States, and with the population
growing so steadily, with consumers
increasing and agricultural
producers decreasing, it is about the
only practical plan for the reduction
of the cost of living. Commissioner
Caminetti, of the bureau of immigration,
said recently that to facilitate
settlements of this kind, the new
farm loan system will be helpful.
Authority was recently vested in the
bureau to promote the distribution
of laborers and settlers upon lands.
Efforts are being made to evolve a
practical system of farm colonization
and to enlist the cooperation of the
individual States. The States are be
a nose wagon.
Paul Kerr, 10-year-od son of Lee
Kerr, of Columbia, was run down
and injured by an automobile driven
by a negro in Columbia Friday,
young Kerr's injuries are not serious.
The car and the negro driver have
lot been identified.
The main building of the Pee Dee
fair plant in Florence was destroyed
by fire Sunday night. It was the
work of incendiaries since the building
was fired in several places.. The
building was valued at about $5,000
and was insured for half that sum.
E. E. Hall, farm demonstrator of
Richland county, has been appointed
by the federal government cottonbreeder,
the purpose being to find
and cultivate the kind of cotton seed
that will best meet the boll weevil
menace?the seed that will mature
the quickest.
At a meeting held in Abbeville,'
Monday afternoon resolutions were
passed ordering the family of Anthony
Crawford, the negro who was
Ivnohed in Abbeville Saturday, to!
leave Abbeville county by November
15. It is said the step was taken in
the interest of peace.
Adjutant General W. W. Moore,
has announced that the Citadel team,
ing asked to reserve lands to solve
the problem of immigrant distribution.
Commissioner Caminetti has
been working with Secretary Wilson
of the department of labor and Secretary
Lane, of the department of the
interior, to develop a practical plan
for the distribution of immigrants.
Jobless Man and Job Meet,
Columbia, Oct. 28.?One of the
features of the State fair this year
was the booth set aside by E. J. Watson,
commissioner of agriculture, for
the use of the United States department
of labor, in connection with the
work being done under the supervision
of the department of labor by
the federal government.
* * J ' ?? ? ? ?? ? ?
mis Doom was very uisuuvtiy
marked, "United States Employment
Service. The jobless man and the
manless job; Uncle Sam is his
friend." On both sides of the entrance
were the signs, "Do you want
a job? Ask the Inspector. Do you
need labor? Ask the Inspector."
Over the entrance was the sign,
"Welcome."
The headquarters of the director,
W. Vaughan Howard, is at Charleston,
and any application sent to him
there will be promptly acknowledged
and cared for, and if it be within his
power to place the applicant in a position
itvis his duty to do so; should
it be an applicant for labor, or any
other form of work, it is his duty to
? - - -L X ^11
find those wfto are competent to mi
the applicant's needs.
It is understood from the inspector
that it is the idea of the department
of labor to establish headquarters
permanently in Columbia, to work in
cooperation with the State commissioner
of agriculture, as soon as
plans can be affected. The thorough
cooperation between the commissioner
of agriculture and the director of
employment has resulted in many
benefits to both the employer and the
employe, and it is thought that the
future will lead to very substantial
results.
UNUSUAL HAPPENING.
S
How a Tiny Screw Held Up a Great
N City's Business.
A diminutive screw worked loose
in one of the big steel safes in the
treasury department of Cincinnati
recently, and dropped into the
mechanism operating the combination.
Thereafter there was trouble,
says the Popular Science Monthly for
November. The screw took its tumble
on a Thursday night and it was
not until the following Tuesday that
the safe was opened. On Friday
morning, when 500 people were
standing in line waiting for $25,000
in pay envelopes reposing behind sixteen
inches of steel, the paymaster
discovered that something . was
wrong. He asked the people to wail
until he found a Jimmy Valentine.
After several men who admitted
that they knew uncanny things about
opening safes were tested out, the
big safe was just as obdurate as
ever, and the line of watchful waiting
ones was dismissed.
Friday night the safe was ordered
drilled open. A crew of four men
worked from that time until Tuesday
morning before they undid the mischief
caused by that one little screw
when it dropped out of its alloted
place. The additional work cost the
city $75, besides the patience of 500
citizens.
jTDE DUTY OF ALL VOTERS
SOUTHERXERS SHOULD GO TO
THE POLLS.
Sneer From G. O. P.?Statement
Calls Attention to SmaJlness of Total
Vote in This Section.
Washington, Oct. 2S.?The national
Republican congressional committee
today issued a statement which
should appeal forcibly to Democratic
voters in South Carolina and which
should be the means of bringing out
a record breaking vote in the election
of November 7. What is called
the "gross inequality" between the
representation in congress from the
South and from other sections is
pointed out, and this should make
Southern Democrats guard their election
rights with more than ordinary
value at the present time, for the reason
that should the vote in the South
this year be no larger than heretofore,
Republicans in congress will undoubtedly
make the situation embarrassing
for members below the Mason
and Dixon iine hereafter.
"Statements have been issued demonstrating
clearly that in congress
the 'South is in the saddle' in respect
to chairmanships of the most important
committees and in regard to
general domination of this section in
important legislation which affects
the whole country. I wish to emphasize
these facts and to particularly
direct attention to the largely disportionate
share which the South

CAUA L IOUO 111 v x. ww
men," declared Hon. Frank M. Downer,
secretary of the Western headquarters
of the national Republican
congressional committee, in a statement
here today.
"As constituted at the beginning
of the Sixty-fourth congress, there
were 435 members, classified as follows:
Democrats, 233; Republicans,
193; Progressives, 7; Independents,
1, and Socialists, 1.
"Eight Southern States, Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, South Carolina, and
Virginia have a total representation
of 66 members in congress; 64 of
these are Democrats, 1 a Republican
and 1 a Progressive.
"There was a total vote cast for
all candidates for congress in these
Southern districts of 511,199, an average
of 7,745 votes to each district.
"Seven Northern States, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Ohio, - Michigan,
Iowa, New Mexico and Idaho, likewise
have a total representation of
66 members, 50 of whom are Republicans
and 16 Democrats.
"There was a total vote cast for
all candidates in these 66 Northern
districts of 2,587,402, an average of
39,203 votes to each district, so that
one vote in eight Southern States was
as potential in the election of a congressman
as five votes in the Northern
States enumerated.
"South Carolina's total vote cast
for congressmen, of whom she has 7,
was 33,414, an average of 4,773 votes
to each district. Minnesota's total |
vote cast for congressmen, of whom
she has 10, was 322,811, an average
of 32,281 votes to each district. Is
there any good reason why a voter in
South Carolina should have nearly
seven times as much to say in respect
to the legislation which shall be
enacted for all the people, as a voter
in Minnesota?
"Florida has four members of congress.
All candidates received 24,076
votes, an average of 6,019 votes
' oii.x. ~ ^
in each district, ine state ui v,uiurado
likewise has four members of
congress. All candidates received
247,506 votes. Colorado being an
equal suffrage State, we divide the
total vote by two, which gives us
123,753, an average of 30,938 votes
to each district. The average voter
in Colorado, both men and women,
believe he or she is just as good and
should have just as much to say in
regard to governmental affairs as any
other voter. It is not believed that
Colorado voters will relish the idea
when they discover that a Florida
voter has five times as much power to
elect a congressman as they.
"Georgia has 12 congressmen. Indiana
has 13. Georgia cast 81,472
votes for all candidates for congress;
Indiana cast 630,249, an average of
6,790 votes per district in Georgia
and 48,480 per district in Indiana.
"Louisiana has eight congressmen.
New Mexico has one. Louisiana cast
51,090 votes for all candidates for
congress, an average of 6,386 per
district. New Mexico, one of the
newest States in the.Union, cast 46,
413 for all candidates for congress.
Certainly a voter in Louisiana should
not be allowed seven times as much
power in respect to the election of
CLASSED STATE OFFICERS.
Killing as to Clerks of Court and
Sheriffs.
Columbia, Oct. 27.?That clerks of
court and sheriffs of South Carolina
are State officers and should take office
on the third Tuesday in January,
when the governor is inaugurated, is
the opinion of Attorney General Peeples,
which was forwarded today in
answer to an inquiry from York. It
has been customary heretofore to regard
sheriffs and clerks of court as
county officers and they have assumed
the duties of their respective offices
on the first Tuesday in January after
the general election.
French Farm Products.
It has been a great problem of the
war how to cultivate the farms of
France. The valley of the Loire is x
the very garden of France, with its
long strips of ploughed land sown in
wheat, oats, luzerne, Indian corn for
nr nlonto^ nritVi irinae nr
ivuutl , \J 1 piautvu TTAIAA ? liito VTA UV\/VO
or other vegetables, sparingly with-7"
potatoes, for the soil is too good. I
drove back twenty-five miles through
the Beauce, the lond of vast wheat
fields reaching golden to the horizon.
It was harvest time, and it seemed to
me there was more than the usual
proportion of women handling the
sheaves. Old men and boys are doing
more than the work of the}r age.
Gen. Joffre has seen to it that, so far
as the military situation allows, soldiers
should be sent back to aid in
the harvest, and there have been
workmen imported from North Africa.
And an attempt has been made
to use the help of German prisoners,
but they seem to have left their efficiency
behind them in their own
country. When the treatment of
prisoners is investigated at the end
of the war it will be found that the
French have carried their courtesy
even into their relations with captured
enemies.
The sum of the present matter is
that France, agricultural France, is
keeping up her intensive cultivation
in spite of the strain of war. It is
this which has made France in ordinary
years self-sufficient in wheat
and most other grain. An American
r- M
may surely add that, where the loosely
cultivated, but less worn, fields of
his own country yield seventeen bushels
to the acre, thi > French soil, worn
with crops for a thousand years, but
cultivated like a garden, gives twenty-three
bushels. French peasants
were always Quick to profit by experience
and infinitely patient in
their individual labor at their land,
but this triumph of intensive cultivation
is scientific as well. The increase
in the yield of French wheat
fields since government aided in
spreading these scientific methods
has often been as much as a third.
All this will tell for the recovery
of France from the losses and waste
of war, and it should tell for the con
tinued igood name of France. If
French peasants had not been good
farmers before the war, willing to
learn as well as to labor, they would
not now be such good soldiers. All
the world knows now how they fight,
but I fear many Americans have very v
little idea how they farm.
This peasant population of France
numbers something over 14,000,000
adults. More peasant men in proportion
are fighting than townsmen'
are, for it is the latter who have to
furnish hands for the war munitions
factories. So, too, more peasant
women are doing men's work in these
harvest fields than there are townswomen
working in war factories.?

only nine, has already begun to learn
something about the subject.
"Which side are you on, Lettie?"
he asked, as they were looking over

"On papa's side," said Lettie, with*

"But is your papa a Democrat or a
