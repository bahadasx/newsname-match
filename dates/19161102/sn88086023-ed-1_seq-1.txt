DISCUSS PLANKING
BYER'S MILL RACE
The council last evening discussed

j The discussion resulted from re- j
Miuests of people in the upper end of j
'the city for bridges across the mill-!
I race. Formerly there were bridges
I over the stream but last winter the 1
I company had them all removed as a:
matter of protection for itself. Coun
cilman Phelps last night reported
that the company refused to put any
more bridges In unless the city stood ,
between It and any lawsuit that might
result from injury or death received ,
by persons while trying to cross the '
bridges.
Members of the council took the
position that It Is not up to the city
to take any such responsibility. This i
led to the suggestion that the mlllrace ;
should be planked over as a mntter of
safety to the public, but no action
was taken last night.

Wilson spiritedly attacked 'big
business opposition to progress." He
declared "the country's leading busi

thank Cod for It?"

CITY TAX LEVY
10 MILLS, BASED (Hi BUDGET
Finance Committee Estimates That a Total of $53,525.38 is
Necessary for City Expenses in the Coming 12 Months

on the budget adopted by the coun
cil last evening- The budget of ex
penses for the next year a.s estimat
ed by the finance committee totals
S53.525.38 and It will require a ten

the past few years has been nine and
a half mills.
The assessed valuation of the prop,
erty of Pendleton is about $250,000
l"ss this year than a year aso, due to
reductions Wiade by Assessor Strain
on many buildings in the city. The
property of Pendleton this year has
an assessed valuation of approximate
ly 15 500 ftctO. A ten mill tax would
thus ffirodure about $55,000 if all the
taxes were collected. However, there
is always about 13000 of the city's
taxes delinquent each year , which
would reduce the amount available to
approximately $52,000. In addition
to the tax money, the city receives an
nually from other sources of revenue
such as fines and license fees, about
$4000, which would brine the total
receipts up to $56 000 approximately,

WASHINGTON Nov. tUnsinjr'a
Matement Indicated that the entire
armed merchantman controversy be
tween the United States and Germany
will reopen if it la proved that the
British steamer Marina carried guns
when she was submarined.
The merchantmen's right to carry
guns is still an open question and will
be the principal issue If negotiations
develop over the death of the sii Am
ericans aboard the Marina.
America maintained that merchant
men had a right to carry guns. Ger
many never admitted the right. The
question first arose over the Lusita
nta. America insisted that merchant
men may carry six inch guns but the
question lapsed.
Lansing expects Germany to claim
that armed merchantmen are not In
cluded In the submarine promises.
The state department continued
gathering Marina evidence but all was
withheld. Wilson kent in constant
