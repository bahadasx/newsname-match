LONDON, Nov. 1.—A Router's dis
patch from Salonlki quotes M. Yen
izelos, the former premier, in an in
terview on the sinking of the Greek
steamer Angheliki by a German sub
marine, as saying:
"It was an act of piracy by a Ger

able death of many Greek citizens
gives the last chance to King Constan

Greece."
ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
Hard fighting is again taking place
on tiie Somme front in France between
the entente allies and the Germans.
Since Tuesday, the British and French j
near Ooureelette and on the Les
Boeufs-Gueudeconrt front and to the
south have been attacking violently,
with the Germans tenaciously holding
them back, except to the east of Les
Boeufs where combined entente forces
have gained some ground, and to the
west of Les Boeufs, in the St. Pierre
Vaast wood and near Sailiy-SailUsel.
where the men of General Focta took
additional German trenches. Between
Lesars and Oueudecourt and in the
vicinity of the Sehwaben redoubt the
Germans are heavily bombarding
British positions.
On the Transylvania front the Ru
manians are keeping up their drive
on- the Austro-Gcrmans in the Jiul
valley, but according to Petrograd the
Teutons have occupied two villages
south of the Rothenthurm pass. In
the Predenl pass sector, the Germans
have penetrated Rumanian positions
and captured ten cannon and seven
teen machine guns, and also have
made further progress southeast of
(he Rothenthurm pass.
Again the Russians have assumed
the offensive in Galicia along the
Narayuvka river and in the Miehisouv
region. Berlin records the ropulse
of five heavy attacks in the former
district and Petrograd admits that
the Russians in the latter zone have
been pressed back by superior Teu
tonic forces.
Bad weather is again hampering op
orations on the Macedonian front, but
nevertheless the British in the Struma
region have taken Barakli-Azuma from
the Bulgarians, while the Serbs have I
made a slight advance on tiie left
bank of the Cerna river and also put
down an attack by the Teutonic allies
and made prisoners of both Itulgar- j
ians and Germans. ,
-------- j
With Hie advent of fine weather In;
tile Austro-Italinn theatre artillery en- j
gagomeiits are being fought all along
the line. The bombardments are e.s
peeially violent east of Gorizia and on
the Carso plateau.

HIS TRIP
Captain of the Deutsch
land Says His Voyage
Was Uneventful.
DODGED MANY SHIPS
German Merchantman, on Her Second
Trip Across tne Atlantic, Carried
Cargo of Dyestuffs and Drugs, and
Possibly Stocks, Bonds and Precious
Stones Valued at Ten Million Dol
lars—Captain Declares Storms Gave
Him More Trouble Than the So
called Blockade—Vessel Injured by
Blows of the Sea.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. l.~
Ten million dollars worth of dyestuffs
and drugs and, it was said, "possibly
stocks, bonds and precious stones,"
comprised the cargo of the German
submarine merchantman Deutschland,
according to a statement tonight by
Captain Paul Koenig, commander of
tiie craft.
Tiie Deutschland is in this port
alter having succeeded in making a
second voyage from a German port
to the American coast, despite the
watchfulness of British and French
vessels.
First of the undersea merchantmen
by use of which Germany hopes to
keep open a trade route with the
United States, the Deutschland, ac
cording to her captain, is at present
the only vessel of that fleet. The
Bremen, which started a voyage Aug
ust 26 from the city after which it
was named, he said, has been given
up as lost. He thought she "must
have struck a mine." but lie added,
"she has not fallen a victim of this
almost blockade. I am sure of that."
The Amerika, which some reports
have indicated was a merchant subma
rine, captured by the British, never
existed, Captain Koenig asserted.
"I must keep up this traffic alone
for the present, that is, the Deutsch
land must,'' he said. "In a fortnight
I shall bn gone. I hope to return
before the end of the year."
It was possible, the navigator stat
ed. that other merchant submarines
would be built by that time.
In a summary of his voyage, just
completed, Captin Koenig, who re
turned with decorations from, Ger
man royalty as marks of recognition
for his pioneer voyage, said this was
"a quiet trip." Recital of Its inci
dents, however, developed matters of
lively interest. The Deutschland did
not lie on the ocean floor this time
as in the voyage which ended at Balti

occasional dodges beneath vessels

when lie sighted a "four funnelled

The venture was begun again on Octo

Captain Koenig said the Deutsch
land was kept under way on the sur
face during most of tiie disturbance,
but at times l>e had her submerged!
and under water she "moved un and
dooyn easily with the seas." So se
vere was the storm that at times the
, submarine made only a. mile an hour'
| headway. Tn' all she was delayed
i three days, her captain figured, and
[fuel was consumed at » rate far in
i excess ot her normal. The Deutsch
'land was still supplied for "nearly
thirty days." when she came in.
During the trie of 4.200 miles, the
Deutschland travo'ed under water leas'
than 100 miles, "ninetv-fivo. I should
think." Captain Koenig said.
! "They call it a blockade. You ran

per exclaimed.
From the emperor tiie Deutschland's
captain received the knightliood cross
of the Order of Hohenzollern, from
the kiug of Bavaria, the Order of St.
Michael: from the king of Wurttem
burg, the knighthood of' Wurttem-|

achievements to his credit than

ceded him. ___
Whi t President
has shewn
more loyal
friendship for
every form of
legitimate bus

present prosperity of the country.
Are the American people going to
permit an American President to
be driven from office by an alien
element in our popuf tion, for
daring t<- insist upon American
rights against a foreign govern
ment? There is no mistaking this
issue.
