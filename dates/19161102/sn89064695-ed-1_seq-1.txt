SUBSCRIPTION: S1.S0 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
Asks For Support Of Law
ler For United States
Senate.
Members of the LaChappelle
family are most ardent supporters
of Dan W. Lawler for the United
States Senate, and they appeal to
their brethern, the Chippewas of
Minnesota to also support him,
not alone because the elder La
Chappelle, who was born and
raised at Prairie du Chien. knew
Mr. Lawler as a boy, but because
he is one of the staunchest friends
the Indians have and is related to
some mixed blood families by
blood.
Michael LaChappelle recently
received a letter from Mr. Lawler
who asks the former's support in
the present campaign. Mr. Li
Chippelle has requested THE
TOMAHAWK to publish the letter
which it does on account of fie
important pledges it contains.
The letter is as follows:
LAW OFFICES
Lawler & Mulally,
New York Life Bldg.
St. Paul, Oct 28, 1916.
Mr. Michael LaChappelle,
White Earth, Minn,,
Dear Mr. LaChappelle:
I take the liberty of requesting
your aid in my candidacy for the
United States Senate. You know
that there are many personal
reasons why the Indians should
support me and you know that I
have always twen their friend..
If there is any question about
this, any member of the La-Chap
pelle family can give the Indians
information about Prairie du Chien
and my relations with the Indians.
I authorize you to say that if elect
ed I shall use my influence to have
agreements between the Govern
ment and the Chippewas carried
out and that I will do all in my
power to have the law of May
18th last contained in the Indian
Appropriation Act, providing for
preference to members of the
Chippewa tribe of Minnesota, as
employees where their tribal funds,
pay the salaries, carried out to the
letter.
I find on returning to my office
today after an absence of some
days campaigning in the northern
part of the state, that Hon. Cito
Sells, Commissioner of Indim
Affairs, on October 26tb, tele
phoned from Minneapolis that he
wanted to see me and wished me
success in my contest.
You will be interested to know
that I came through Prairie du
Chien on the Burlington about six
weeks ago. The old town is not
changed very much and some of
the old French farms look exactly
as they did when we were boys.
Yours very truly,
D. W. Lawler.
Mr. Lawler\s letter is the most
important document any member
of this reservation has received
since Representative Steenerson
pledged himself in writiDg, to try
and secure the passage of the ad-
Defective Page
-tyfrt^rtlX*
^""V*
ditional allotment act, and which
caused him to secure the unani
mous support of the Chippewas
and thus to defeat Judge Grinde
land for Congress.
The Lawler letter is important
because he places himself squarely
on record regarding what he will
do for the Chippewas.
There is not the least doubt
about Mr. Lawler's sincerity for
he is well known by members of
this reservation as being in full
sympathy with the Chippewas re
garding whose affairs he keeps
well informed.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
will not be disappointed in Mr.
Lawler's promises, for even if he
should fail to be elected he still
will be in a position to help them
if Pi esident Wilson is re-elected.
How Wilson Sat On
Moorhead.
If Prof. Moorhead, former spec
ial Indian agent, had been success
ful in his opposition last spring to
Chippewa appropriations there
would have been no big payment
mide to the Chippewas of Minne
soto this year.
Mr. Moorhead wrote Senator
Gionna of North Dakota against
the efforts of the Chippewa dele
gation from this state to get the
big payment made, or rather an
appropriation for the payment,
and stated that the efforts of the
delegation ws instigated by the
mixed bloods of this reservation
who wanted an appropriation as
well for th expenses of a general
council to further their schemes as
for the big payment- He in fact
slated more than was true in order
to prejudice congress, and stated
that the publisher of THE TOMA
HAWK, whom he named, was main
taining a lobby at Washington.
Mr. Moorhead's letter to Sen
ator Gronna. copies of which he
.sent to members of the senate and'
house committees on Indian affairs,
was so incorrect and untruthful
that the publisher wrote President
Wilson, and accompanied by Mr.
I) B. Henderson, the Washington
attorney, went to the White House
and the president not being there,
livered the letter to the assist
ant private secretary of the presi
d"nt who stated that when the
latter r'tjrned from a short
ride down the Potomac River, it
would be delivered to him.
Upon receipt of the letter Presi
dent Wilson immediately directed
Secretary Lane to make an investi
gation of the matter conta'ned in
the letter.
Evidently Secretary Lane must
have learned that' Moorhead had
been a trouble maker upon this
reservation, for we were informed
last week by Mr. Ilobt. Holcombe
that he had seen in one of the
newspapers that Mr. Moorhead
had resigned and had given as his
reason for doing so that the
mixed blood faction of this
reservation was being support
ed by the president and he
could no longer remain with the
Board of Indian Commissioners.
Mr. Holcombe, who is one of
the writers for the Minnesota State
Historic il Society, no doubt saw
this in an eastern newspaper, so
that Mr. Moorhead's resignation
e^capod the notice of those upon
this reservation.
If Mr. Moorhead has resigned,
the last of the trouble makers in
official circles is gone, and this is
a good illustration of President
Wilson's intention to have a clean
administration. This is what has
ooide him so popular with all
classes.

Truth before Favor."
Establishes A Peculiar
System Ot Electioneer
ing Among Indians.
It is to be regretted that the big
payment to the Chippewas of Min
nesota is now in progress instead
of being delayed a couple of weeks,
for it is charged that it is being
u^ed to prejudice Indian voters
against the present federal admin
istration.
The manner in which Supt. Hin
ton has been discriminating against
Indian democrats, and then plac
ing thf1
responsibility upen the In-
dian office at Washington, it is
charged, leads the more intelligent
members of the tribe to think the
game that is being played, in view
of the doubt to which political
party Minnesota's electoral vote
will go, is only a new political
dodge to prejudice Indian voters
against the Wilson administration.
There may be no giounds for
the charge that Supt. Hinton, who
was formerly a democrat but is
now, it is stated, a republican, and
his office force, the members of
which are all republicans, are try
ing to favor their party, hence we
say it is unfortunate that the pay
ment is being made just prior to
the election instead of immediate
ly following it.
There is no douot that some
competent, sober and self-support
ing, prominent members of this
reservation, who are strong, active
democrats usually, have had their
distributive share of annuities
with held by the superintendent
upon the most frivolous pretexts
while drunken warehousers who
are well known republicans were
given their annuities without hesi
tation.
The suspicion that politics have
much to do with the manner in
which the payment is being made
se^ros to be well founded, for it is
not the first time that Chippewa
Indian payments have been use
to control Indian votes during an
election as this was done during
the last Cleveland administration
to induce, the Indian voters* to be
present at the polls to vote.
Kegardiess of pa/ty affiliations
no person in the government ser
vice should us^ Indian annuit.v
payments to advance the interests
of his party as it is charged its now
being done by Supt. Hinton and
his force.
Whether the with holding of an
nuities was a part of a plan to
prejudice Indian voters against the
Wilson administration or not, it
has that result. Intelligent re
publican and democrat Indians of
this reservation will have no sym
pathy with the system of using In
dian annuity payments to control
their votes.
Whether the same system will
be used upon all the Chippewa
reservations which are all under
the charge of republican superin
tendents remains to be seen ac
cording to the results of the re
turns after the election.

A Trip To La Pointe,
Wisconsin.
(By Rev. C. H. Beau'ieu.)
To THE TOMAHAWK.
(Continued from last issue.)
My first inquiries led to the dis
covery thai Bayfield, like Ashland,
with the departure of tourists and
summer cottagers upon the island
had suspended hourly boats, that
but one conveying the mail plied
between the island and the main
land. As the gentleman in the
oost office said, "you can get over
but once a day but as there are
many locally owned private
launches on the island you will
find no difficulty in getting back."
At the dock I spoke freely and in
an exhuberant way to those waiting
in the pavillion like myself for the
mail boat. I inquired as to the
way of getting back and a La
Pointer, a youngish man, agreed
to bring me back. We entered
into compact to meet at the island
post office at 4 p. m.
Like the bus line at Detroit,
M'tm., the mail boat (also light
freight boat) charges passengers
by the round U'ip, 2octp, giving a
ticket for return. I had to pay
the 25cts to go over, and as I did
1
"^h'^,
not wish to wait until next day
afternoon to use my ticket I had
to keep it as evidence that human
nature everywhere takes ad van
tage of the necessities of morey.
What will the pro Germans think
of the name of the craft that plies
between La Pointe and Bayfield
The owner is evidently oro Eng
lish for the boat is named Leuisi
tania.
I had no misgivings however as
I stepped aboard of the little name
sake of the ill fated liner.
I could at Bayfield see no evi
dence of German activity, there
fore had no fear of submarines.
I had inquired of Mr. Hussell,
the man who was to aid in my
"come back" to Bayfield, as to the
location of the residence of Joe
Neveux, he informed me and added,
"Joe will come over on that in
coming boat.
When the boat landed and its
passengers began to pour out, Mr.
Russell said, "There's Joe," and
with a rather long foiefinger spec
ialized Joe and with the reinforce
ments in description of Joe's dress.
I followed the finger and the res
cription of dress, but 1 really did
not need the specifications.
Knowing that Joe was coming
over because called for in Ashland,
and knowing him to be the uncle
of the sons of the late Mrs. Mar
gart Fairbanks. I should, unaided,
have spotted Joe far away, for
only for difference in age, Joe
Neveux a.id Robertonce Fairoanks
are twins io-appearance -of count
enance.
Then in addition there was the
"Call of the Blood" for Joe and
myself are Chippewas.

Joe had to take the train for
A&hland in about half an hour's
time, I had to take the little boat
there rocking at the pier yet wo
tarried, and talked and talked in
the tongue of our aboriginal for
bearers, until Joe had to tear him
.self away. My boat was in sijht
and could'nt get away from me
"unbeknowncst" so I had no sense
of fear of getting left.
While in the pavillion on the
dock at Bay field with Mr. Russell,
I entered a little into personal
history and pedign e, announcing
myself to be of Indian descent. A
lady of darkish complexion seemed
to be interested in my story and I
construed her intentness to bo
from tribal interest as well as that
of personal curiosity. 1 ventured
to remark that she was of Indian
descent, she answered with a
laugh, "Tins has often been said
to me, but I am purely English."
Mr. Russell to keep up the topic
said to the lady,(also an Islander)
"You look more Indianny than
this gentleman," wagging his head
towards me.
1 am glad he wagged his head
and did not use his forefinger as
an indicator as when he point*
out "Joe."

my clerical clothes saved
me from the finger, for undoubted
