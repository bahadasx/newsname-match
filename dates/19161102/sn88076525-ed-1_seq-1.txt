rieties of {potatoes for all commercial
and seed purposes to give-special at
tention to seed improvement and dis
semination, especially in relation to
standard commercial varieties to im
prove sorting and grading methods on
the farm and at loading stations and
to co-operate with the National As
-sociation in the establishment of
standard gradea and adopting a label
to be attached tprsuch standard grades
•*—to promote^tte raitdhg of desirable
"types of..po£atoes-and encourage the
elimination of undesirable types
Thie potatoes from Noitii Dakotsr
are much in demand for both seed and
-.table purposes. Much of th^ir popu
larity is due to the general freedom
-from diseases. As more potatoes^ are
». grown in the state more, disease is
"HkelyLto appear. It is thru w^piv

One of the great events in the state
during the past week was the Hdme
Coming Day at the University of
North Dakota on Saturday, Oct. 28.
It was a great-day for the University
it was a great day for North Dakota,
for in the great mass meeting in the
morning, in the enthusiasm shown in
the football game in the afternoon and
in the toast program of the banquet of
the. evening, the fact wa#., apparent
that one of the lyings- thai:«oiike8 a
the speakers were some of the most
prominent men in the state, all gradu
ates of the University.
Lynn J. Frazier, candidate for gov
ernor, stood as an example of the farm
boy whose University education not
only did not unfit him for the work of
farming, to which he returned after
his graduatoin but has placed him as
the foremost man in the politics of the
state today.
Hon. Victor Wardrope was one of
the convocation speakers, another of
North Dakota's sons, who is a can
didate for states attorney of Benson
county. Fred Traynor of Devils Lake
—son of tiie soil, has done much to
make politics in-North Dakota cleaner,
was a speaker of the evening. All of
these and many other speakers are ex
amples of what the State University
of North Dakota has done for its peo
ple and in their addresses they quoted
examples of mien who have come
up from our farms, graduated from
the. University, and have taken the
mgst prominent places in the work o|
&& state^the state legislature ancl the
halls of Congress. /.
Another fact was noticeable at this
Home Comng time. Among the Al
umni were many women of middle age
who as much as two decades ago gia^
uated from the Slate University. They
are now among the leading house
wives in their communities. Some are
presidents of Civic League and the
Women's Clubs in their towns. Oth
ers as farmers' wives are prize Man
ners as butter makers and raisers of
poidtry in the better farming contests
and all of them realizing what an ed
ucation means in the business of life,
ar8"Bendirig, or planning to send, their
sonS and daughters to the institution
that has fitted them for the success
they are making.

PEOPLE'S FIRST CHANCE IN 27
YEARS TO VOTE ON A PROHI
BITION MEASURE.
On November 7th the voters of
North Dakota will have the firyt
chance in 27 years to vote on a prohi
bition measure. By referendum peti
tion the bootlegging law goes to the
ballot. This law hits the brewer, and
distiller by making the liquor solicitor
a bootlegger and is aimed at the walk
ing liquor peddler. The outside li
quor interests are fighting the bill des
perately. Do you want the bootleg
ger in your community and North Da
kota. If not vote for the bootlegging
Law. It will be on the referendum
ballot as follows:

THE ISSUE OF CHARACTER.
New York Sun, Oct. 25.—Half a
dozen correspondents have asked The
own special list of the ten, twenty, or
fifty best reasons for voting Wilson
out and Hughes in on November 7.
We suppose we could construct a
list of five hundred such reasons, for
the stock of raw material is practical
ly inexhaustible.
This is. scarcely necessary. We
shall content, ourselves with inviting
renewed attention to the one supreme
sufficient, all comprehensive issue of
the election.
Its outlines are coming into sharper
focus every day as the time for the
ballot approaches. The supreme is
sue is the plain and intelligible ques
tion involved in the marked contrast
between, two personalities.
1. Intelligence without character
2. Character with intelligence.
No. One is Woodrow Wilson.
Number Two is Charles Evans
Hughes.
Every voter knows or ought to know
the difference
We are using the word character in
the broad sense recognized by the lex
icographeres.

MISS TENA IVERSON OF STARK
WON THE NEW OVERLAND
CAR.
The most successful subscription
contest ever conducted in this part of
the state has just been closed by Hie
World, .the closing having taken
Saturday evening at 8:00 o'clock and
immediately the judges took posses*
sion of the ballot box and counted the
ballots, and the result is given below.
The Judges were Hon. T. J. Dough
erty of Starkweather, County Treas
urer E. L. Duell and Wm. Falger.
While all the contestants were no
doubt anxious to receive the first
prize, which was a 1917 Overland car,
model 85-4, costing $865, we believe.
that all connected with the contest will ,*y
admit that from the beginning it was
conducted in an honorable and upright
manner, and that the winner was en
titled to the car for the hard work
she did from the start. If we were to
judge from immediate cash results,
we would say that The World made no
money out of the contest, but we be
lieve that all will agree that we lived
up to every promise we made the con
testants, and that none have reason to
complain. We believe that we have
demonstrated that a subscription con
test can be carried on in an honest and
fair manner, and without playing any
favorites.
The closing of this contest gives
The World the largest subscription list 1
of any paper published in Ramsey
county, and today one would have to
rake the county with a fine-tooth comb
to find a home where The World is not
read. It has made it much more val
uable to our advertisers, and as an ad
vertising medium it stands without a
1
Devils -Xiafee. merd&ote.
prove this statement we are willing to
deposit $100 in any bank, and after a
fair examination by any set of com
petent judges, if they find that there
is either a weekly or daily published
that has 50 per cent of the circulation
of The World in Ramsey County, out
side of the city of Devils Lake we will
donat that $100 to any charitable in
stitution the committee may nawB
Furthermore, we doubt if there is a
paper published that has 25 per cent
of the circulation of The World in
Ramsey county, outside of this city.
We want to thank the contestants
and their friends who were interested
in ths contest. It has been a pleasure
of The World management and ou~
contest manager to do business with
them, and we believe that they will
agree that they have had only the
fairest kind of treatment all the way
through.
Miss Iverson, who won the first'
place is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.!
Iver Iverson, well known and prosper-/
ous farmers of the Starkweather dis
trict. She is a splendid little lady
and as she stated at the close of the
contest, she worked'-hard every day
securing subscribers and dreamed*'
about the car nightsv And judgihg
from the number ol old and new sub
scribers names she -turned in, 'her
statement is tn/e. Saturday evening
after the contest she drove the car
home and it is placing it mildly when
we say that she was a happy girl.
Mrs. C. E. Stinson gets second prize,
which is a beautiful Victrola talking
machine, valued at $100. Mrs. Wm. £4
Redmond gets third prize which is $50
cash. Miss Mildred Dougherty of
Edntdre gets fourth prize which is $26
in gold.
The votes of the Winners were as
