Nyhart Sunbeams.
Hello folks, here I come with
tidings from "Peaceful Valley."
By the way, did you know that
the fountain of neroetual youth
for which Ponec de Leon sought
so rhliffpntlv. is located right here
in Peaceful Valley? Well, it is,
and any of the natives will show
you the spring and invite you to
drink and not charere you a cent.
If you want to be "sunny' ' and
live again the days ot your youth
we invite vou.
"When 1 read the speeches of
Hughes, W llson, liryan, Keed ana
others and compare them with
the firey outbursts which occur
daily at the cross roads emporium
of Mayor Campbell how puerile
and insignificant - they appear.
Seems like all the, statesmen are
one' the farms yet. .
Bob Sprouls the genial "hill
billy" just north of Nyhart,
killed a "hawg" the other day
and brought the "mayor" some
fine country sausage. Aside from
being a socialist and a little bit
"queer" at times, Bob is a real
good fellow.
In Bates county there arc about
a million men whose mothers
raised their boys to be a soldier
at least you'd think so to hear
them, talk of wanting war ' with
Mexico. But say, just wait till
the call comes and see them hike
for the woods.
Mrs. Pal Englehardt has been
quite sick with malarial fever, at
the home of her sister, Mrs. Wm.
Simpson. Dr. Lockwood was out
to sec her Tuesday of last week.
She is getting along nicely which
her many friends will be glad to
know. In the meantime Pal is
"baching."
Some one asked, me the other
day "when the war in Europe
would be ended" and I said that
so far as I have been able to in
form myself I thought' the end
would come soon as the "war was
over" and I don't know of any
one who can give a more intelli
gent answer, do you?.
Somebody has produced an
"odorless" onion. So the onion
farmer may as well put away the
hoe and rake. Who on earth
would bother catins onions if
thev can't have the pleasure of
blowing their onion scented
breath in the face of some one
who don't eat onions. I hope the
report is not true, 'twould be a
calamity indeed.
I attended a good roads ' ' meet
in' " last week at Cornland school
house under the auspices of But
ler -Commercial Club. The meet-
ine was very interesting. The
speakers were a little "back
ward" about coming "forward'
hut all acnuitted themselves nob
Jy. It listens good and I hope
their plans for the Jcferson High
way may be fully carried out.
Our came warden. J. A. Patter
son, left last Monday on the 10 :05
train headed north. I asked him
where he was going and he 'said
"sealed orders." Don't know
where he was going but he was on
hin wa.v. Poachers and law
breakers would better be careful
for Doc. will trathcr cm in.
. An "odorless" onion and that
ain't all. some one has developed
a "puckerless persimmon" will
wonders never cease, ooon wc
mnv exneet to have an "odorless
skunk" or a skunk who carries
a sachet powder. Ain t it awful.
Let the road be rough and
dreary and it end far out of sight,
foot it bravely, strong or weary,
vote for Wilson He's all right.
Once upon a dark night dreary,
as I puzzeled faint and weary,
over half a hundred bills I should
have paid before, suddenly there
came a tappine. 'twas the sheriff
loudly rapping boldly asking
for admission, to my little "cross
roads" store. Nothing less and
nothing more. Open, then I flung
the portal, when in stepped a lord
ly mortal with a star as big as
"Venus" one I ne'er had seen be
fore. Loudly he began to sputter
and I'll swear he did not stutter.
He could speak the plainest "lin
- go" I had ever heard before. Aye
"he was sorte talker "shore." Not
a minute stopped or stayed he
. with vitrolic tongue he flayed me
, told of all the mean things I
had ever done before. Said I was
not fit for "livin' " on this earth
. or np in Heaven, other things he
aid galore many things, which
made me sore. AH in vain my
humble pleading, for he blustered
on unheeding, said a "cussin" I
was needing should have had it
long before. Here 1 grabbed my
old six shooter, then I said you
"pop-eyed hooter" get you go
ing from my house and come back
never, never more ; and he mur
mured as he scooted for the door,
"Never more."
P. S. It was only a "dream"
and the noise was made, by a
"section hand" on his way to
work who had left his tobacco at
home and wanted a dime's worth
of Horse Shoe.
