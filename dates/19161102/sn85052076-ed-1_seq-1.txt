Patch the Roof
VWe can't patch the root when it rains, and we don't
need the roof patched when it doesn't rain." That is the
reasoning of the sluggard.
But the man with a headpiece thinks ahead. The
time to patch the roof is now. And while we are patch
ing the roof let us lay in fire-wood, and repair the road
so that winter will not destroy it, and lay a log over the '
stream for the children to cross on in going to school.
How to Vote
Do not vote for money. No man and no party is rich
enough to buy the vote of any honest man. Your vote is
a sacred responsibility, and it is never for sale.
And if you will not vote for money you will not vote
for favor, or to please somebody else, for any selfish ad
vantage. Your vote is a trust you represent your wife,
and your neighbors, and your country, and are honor
bound to respect their interests and not merely your own.
Do not vote for a man because you think he is going
to be. elected. You are to vote according to your con
science whether anybody else votes that way or not.
Vote for the man that you think will do the moat
good for all the people of this whole country.
And do not be upset by any of the lies that will be
set afloat just before the election. Listen, think and
pray, make up your mind beforehand, and then vote for
your country and your God.

Vhilfl the people of the United
States have been sending thirty mil
lion dollars' worth of relief to
Europe and Turkey, two hundred
Utouxand women and children in
Albania have died of starvation.
While each woman and child in
Belgium has plenty to eei, women
and children in Albania have gnaw
ed at the carcasses of dead horses
in the streets.
William Willard Howard, of New
York, who has returned from his
third trip to this hunger xone of
Europe, predicts, that the entire
population of Albania will die of
famine and pestilence unless help
ed. He says that in Albania corn
is fifty dollars a bushel, flour eighty
dollars a sack, and macaroni five
dollars a pound.
"Tim tragedy of Albania." says Mr.
Howard, "is that a nation is dying
of hunger, while the people of the
United States, laden with gifts for
the rest of Europe and for Turkey,
pass by on the other side.
"Is it fair is it human that the
innocent women and children of Al
bania, hn never did anyone any
harm, should be trampled under foot
and left to perish, at a time when
all others are fed?

ak of all fair-minded men and wo
men in the United States: Why
should the Albanians three hun
dred thousand of them Christiana,
be left to starve, while we press
fcrward, in generous rivalry, to
feed the others? The Albanians
are more numerous than the Ar
menians; yet we feed the Armenian
and let the Albanians starve.
"Having appealed to deaf ears in
high places, I now appeal to the
plain people to fair-minded men
and women who would' not let even
a dog starve to death, no matter
what his breed. I want to go back
to Albania with a shipload of food.
I have arranged for a ship a new
American ship, just launched and
lilted for sea. The ship is ready and
waiting.
A nunilter of distinguished gentle
men in New York mostly clergy
men and editors of newspapers
will co-operate in an appeal for a
relief cargo for the ship. The treas
urer selected to receive the con
tribntious is the Rev. Frederick
Lynch, D.D., editor of The Christian
Work and secretary of the Carnegie

in any amount from the price of a

this time the auditorium of the

a noticeable feature. It waa every

thusiasm manifested in the school,
home and farm problem showed no
lack of organization on the part of
Superintendent, Tckehers, and
County Agents, Miss Spence and

attention to the essays found in the

give you an idea of some of the work
done at thia fair. These are prize

A fleet of German torpedo-boat
destroyers made a raid on English
transports which carried troops
across the English Channel, during
the week. It was a very daring act
and the English are chagrined that
eight of the ten raidera escaped un
harmed. Since the beginning of the Eu
