MEXICO, AUDRAIN COUNTY, MISSOURI, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1916
SAME OLD STUFF.
THERE Is an advertisement in the
Mexico Ledger headed "State-Wide
Prohibition Means State-Wide Ru.
in." That the liquor interests are
forced to resort to this time-worn fal
se; proves the weakness of their case.
The following statement from Gor
don Jones, President of the United
States Bank of Denver, Colo., who
voted against that State going dry,
but who publicly acknowledges his
mistake in view of the developments
since the liquor traffic has been dis
continued, is another of the many
statements of fact which readily dis
prove the Brewers' contentions.
What applies to one unit of a state
certainly applies to the whole as the
Brewers themselves agree.
Some of the benefits of prohibition
in Denver ad Mr. Jones gives them
are:
Bank clearings increased 26 per
cent in nine months.
Bank deposits increased 16.4 per cent
in nine months.
Nineteen thousand nine hundred
and seventy-eight savings accounts
opened.
Savings deposits increased $3,624,-
058.83.
Building permits gained 55.67 per
cent. !
Post Office receipts gained 9.5 per
cent in nine months.
Delinquent tax list much shorter
than for years.
Ninety-five per cent of the 1916
tax already collected.
Business failures decreased 36.33
per cent.
Retail business gained from 16 to
48 per cent
Collections invariably better.
Family washing business of laun
dries increased 20 per cent.
Fifteen hundred new water "taps
during 1916.
Electric light business gained $10,
000 first month of prohibition.
No vacant houses.
All real estate men have waiting
lists.
Many rents increased 5 to 10 per
cent v
Five hundred and ninety-six new
building permits for residences.
Twenty-two per cent fewer vacant
tore buildings.
Arrests for drunkenness decreased
60.6 per cent
Murders 33 1-8 per cent less.
General arrests 30.5 per cent less.
Thirty-seven discharged to one re
ceived at the State Penitentiary.
Sunshine Rescue Mission gives $6
to $8 in free meals weekly; formerly
$40 a week.

SULLIVAN SALE A SUCCESS

this city, and Miss Gertrude Lobdell,
of Washington, D. C, daughter of
Judge Charles Lobdell, of the new
Federal Farm Loan Board, at the
bride's home in Washington, Sunday,
was the culmination of a pretty ro
mance which began in Kansas several
years ago.
Mr. Berry's meeting with his wife
was wholly accidental. During ms
summer vacation, before he entered
college, he accompanied several Mex
ico boys to Larned, Kansas, to work
in the harvest fields. In the search
for work he visited the Lobdell home.
Finding no work there they were
leaving the premises when they were
called back by Mrs. Lobdell, who has
a son the same age, and who told the
boys if they would wait she would
telephone to several farms in an ef
fort to secure a place for them.
In the course of conversation she
learned they were from Mexico, Mo,

home every Sunday while they were in
that vicinity. It was in this way Mr.
Berrey and his bride met.
Mrs. Berrey is a graduate of the
Kansas University, class of 1916,
She is a charming young woman and
very talented.
Mr. Berrey is editor of the Enter
prise of Chico, California, an eight-
page daily paper. His success in the
newspaper field has been rapid and
reflects his splendid ability in this
work.
The young people were married last
Sunday in Washington, D. C, at the
home of the bride, by the Reverend
Thomas H. Smith. Immediately after
the ceremony they left for this city,
arriving here Monday night
Mrs. R. W. Berrey gave a reception

PARTY AT BENTON CITY
About three hundred people, young
and old, gathered at the Tratchel
Hall Tuesday night to attend a
masked Hallowe'en Party,, given by
Harry Hildebrand, Barley Arvin and
Irvin Tratchel, of Benton City.
A decorated automobile parade was
the first thing on the program. Af
ter driving through the streets of
Benton City the seventeen cars took
a joy ride to Mexico where they were
rcvally received. Upon return to tne
hall, which was well decorated with
the season's colors, a large crowd
greeted them.
After trying to identify each other
for some time the game of guessing
each other was started, and as each
guess was recognized they were re
quired to unmask. Some were too
well disguised to be recognized, and
were asked to remove their masks,
The fortune tellers booth, run by
Mrs. W. H. Coil, on account of its
solendid equipment and management,
was well patronized. Owing to the
immense crowd, only a few of the
numerous games planned by Mr. and
Mrs. G. W. Russell could be used, but
were thoroughly enjoyed.
After a eood social time, refresh
ments which were in charge of Mrs,
Zula Dudley and Mrs. Alfred Hicks,

late hour all departed for their homes.

She was found dead, with four cigar

teacher. ThiB is Miss Anna
Brien's second term. She has two
pupils, both of whom are preparing
for rural graduation. The house was
painted and papered inside. And the
stove was blacked. The house is neat
clean, and cheerful inside.
Lawder also believes in keeping a
good teacher. Miss Pcrcie Fuhrer is
teaching her third term here. She
has twenty-two pupils. The floor was
oiled, the barns were moved back, a
new fence was built, the outbuildings
were repaired, and lime is being used
in them. Sweepq is being used, and
they have a pencil sharpener. Ihis
very greatly improved the looks of
their home, and adds greatly to the
health and comfort of their children.
Miss Blanche White is the teacher
this year at Liberty. This is her
home district They have a sanitary
drinking fountain, an organ, and the
only wood stove now being used in the
county. A short time ago she had a
successful pie supper and will use the
money to oil the floor, buy books, and
other needed equipment They are
now using Sweepo.
Duly is another school that recog
nizes the value of retaining the old
teacher. This is Miss Bessie Day's
third term. She has a large Bchool
with thirty-one pupils present. Her
'A" class contains ten, and the "C"
class has nine. It is needless to Bay
there are very interesting classes.
New paper and paint add much to
the appearance inside. This school has
a flag pole and flag an honor but
few in the county can claim. Duly
claims the honor of being the boy
hood home of John D. O'Rear. A few
nights ago they had a box supper and
entertainment and were honored by the
presence of and a speech by Mr.
U Kear. jno doubt the atiair was a
great success.
Miss Marie Henderson is also teach
ing the school in her home district,
Sneed. She has nineteen pupils.
They now have a good library of more
than a hundred books in a new case.
This year a fine agricultural chart
has been added to their equipment It
is very helpful in the class work.
They also have new window shades.
Miss Anna McMurtry is another
teacher whose home is in the district
in which she is employed, Carter. She
has eighteen pupils. They have - a
pencil sharpener, and find it very use
ful. A fine new heater put in before
school began. One of the best im
provements that can be made. And it
is required by our school law, which
says that the board of directors shall
provide a satisfactory system of heat
ing and ventilation.
As the desks are too high, a number
of the pupils are using boxes. This
helps some. Nearly every school-
house in the nounty needs a few small
desks. At night a number were pre-
esnt to see the pictures illustrating
The Dangers of the House Fly.
Rush Hill is again fortunate in that
Miss Anna Miller still has charge of
the primary folks. She has a full room
as also has Miss Nola Hanna who has
charge of room 2, and is the principal.
The floors were oiled, new paper and I
paint were put on room 2, and the
blackboards were painted. Good
work is being done in both rooms, and
all seem to be enjoying their school
wrk.
D. Oty Grace is the principal at Mar
tinsburg. Miss Lottie Moore has
charge of the primary room, and Miss
Lucile Moore of the intermediates.
There are about twenty-five in each
room. The house was painted outside,
the floors were oiled, twelve new
chairs were purchased for the little
ones. They have pencil sharpeners,
and $125 was spent for library books,
maps, and other class equipment They
expect to get their school on the
accredited list this year. Mr. Grace
is a live, enthusiastic school man, and
is truly making good.
Laddonia has a good school this
year. G. C. Weiss for the third term

A New Municipal Hospital for Mex
ico is being discussed. At a meeting
of the Board of Directors of the Mex
ico Hospital last Monday night it was
decided to call a meeting of the stocK-
holders of the Hospital on Thursday
night to place before them the propo
sition of turning over to the city the
equipment of the present Hospital,
providing that the city would maice a
bond issue for the purpose of build
ing a new municipal Hospital building.
At this meeting a full report 01 an
the expenses and receip's of tne
Hospital since it was opened three
years ago will be made.
Many citizens have expressea tnem-
selves as favoring a Municipal Hos
nital. according to J. W. Dry, Presi
dent of the Board of Stockholders of
the Mexico Hospital, and they are to
be given an opportunity to have auch
an institution here. The present Hos
pital has been growing ever since its
establishment, until a new and mod
ern and larger building is needed to
accommodate its patrons. The matter
of the legality of the bond issue has
been investigated by several attor
neys who have declared that it would
be legal for the city to issue bonds for
a Municipal Hospital, says Mr. Dry.
No steps toward the establishment
of a Municipal Hospital have yet
been taken by the city, but after
Thursday's meeting the city will
know on what it may depend regarding
a Hospital, and the citizens of Mexico
will have an opportunity to express
their feelings in tho matter of a new
and modern Municipal Hospital for
the city.

gentleman and made many friends in
many places during his long and use-
ful life. His death will be generally
mourned.
