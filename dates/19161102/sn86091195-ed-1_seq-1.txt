CIETY NOTES
Hallow
with
for the
ushering in the week
new moon, led to the disnp
of Dull Care and Duty, and
time being one might almost
have believed from the appearance of
the luasqued dances on the streets,
Tuesday evening, that they were in
New Orleans at Mardi Oras, for the
ghosts, witches, fays and fairies with
their weird lights darting in aad out
among the trees lent a charming effect
to this madcap season. Many bonfires
helped to light the city and the good
natured way in which the pranks of
the youngsters were received told that
fun, mirth and frivoltv was the order
of the day. Many parties were given,
among them being the beautiful after
noon card and Kensington given by
Mrs. John Guthrie Brown and Mrs. .Sam
uel Wilson at the K. of H. hall, to
about 10« guests. The hall was a sym
phony in its autumn colors ami the
spirit of Hallowe'en shone forth from
a myriad of golden lighted candles.
Beautiful yellow popcorn crysanthe
mums decorated the tables. Punch wa3
nerved by Mrs. Fred Cowan and Mrs.
Fred T. Dubois. Assisting the hostesses
were Mesdames Earley, Aldrich, Thore
sen, Patrie and Miss Hart. Miss Bren
nan carried off the prize for cards,
while Mrs. Pearson and Mrs. Cheney
were given the Kensington prizes.
The ghosts of all departed spirits—
white und Indian—returned from their
happy hunting grounds and paid a vis
it to Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Johnson, from
the witching hours of 9 to 1, Tuesday
evening. Judging from the sound of
hilarity the spirits welcomed their re
lease. None seemed to fear the sight
of the spooks walking the streets .The
air was full of the sounds of horns and
bells and upon entering the dance hall
—the newly finished garage—one was
simply entranced by its fairy-like beau
ty. It had been transformed into a syl
van glade where tiny lights only re
lieved the impression of the home of the
gnomes, witches and fairies. Over it
all the good witch presided and brew
ed a drink that seemed to cheer the
spirits to greater pranks. Father Time

A TRUNK OF BOOZE CAPTURED
Yesterday noon Sheriff Simmons
seized a trunk full of redeye booze,
consisting of :iti flasks of "Lucky
Springs'' brand of bootleg juice that
was probably intended for election
purposes. The old and battered trunk
had only a baggage check on it, and
while the possessor of the check is
known, the check cannot be located.
The trunk was shipped from Idaho
Falls.
OARAGE HAS JOLLY OPENING
Last night the Johnson garage on
Judicial street was opened for business
by a Hallowe'en dance on the cement
■floor. The garage was nicely decorated
for the occasion and Mrs. Johnson fur
nished the invited guests a palatable
lunch. The new garage will be under
the management of Fred Green, the well
known mechanician.

READ BIG- AD IN
THIS PAPER
AND SEE
WHY
UNFAIR CAMPAIGNING.
The Candidate for County Superintendent on the Democratic Ticket
is using an unfair method of campaign and is making statements, and
having statements printed in the various papers for which there is no
justification.
For the information of the electors you are advised that the Republi
can candidate, Grace Faulconer, is qualified to take the office of County
Superintendent if elected, and will be able to qualify on the second
Monday in January, 1917. Mrs. Faulconer has been a teacher in the
public and high schools for nine years past, and will have taught in this
state under a certificate as required by law for two years or more next
proceeding the time wbn she will be entitled to qualify as county super
intendent.
The following is an extract from the opinion of the Attorney Gen
eral in this connection:
"I have held in a number of cases that if the candidate possesses
the requisite qualifications at the time he presents himself to take the
oath of office and qualify that he is eligible to fill the office.
"So far as I can tell from the statements given me, the person you
have in mind (Grace Faulconer), will have been able by the second Mon
day of January next, to have taught a school year under a certificate of a
grade not lower than a state certificate.' '
For your Information Grace Faulconer took the examination for
her State certificate on November 17-18 and 19, 1915, but through some
delay in the State Superintendent's office the crtiflc&tc was not Issued
until March, 1916, but, under the law and the decisions her qualifica
tions would revert hack to the date when she actually passed the ex
amination and was entitled to the certificate, and no technicality such
as the failure of the State Superintendent 's office to issue the certifi
cate when it was due would preclude her of her rights thereunder.
Inasmuch as Mr. Bartlett has endeavored to use unfair means to
secure his election we feel certain when the facts are known that the
voters of this county are not going to permit him to carry off his elec
tion by such unfair means.
Inasmuch as Grace Faulconer is the only woman candidate on either
ticket we especially urge the women of this county to use their efforts
and influence to secure her election so that they will have a representa
tive in the county government in which matters they are entitled to
participate the same as the men.

IDAHO
Jf
SHOULD BE
RE-ELECTED
.
as
Mr. Garfield Bond, County Com
missioner of the Second District, and
the present chairman of the Board, is
a candidate for re-election on the Re
publican ticket. Mr. Bond is a young
man of exceptionally good business
judgment and ability, well qualified
for the office by reason of his past
experience in public afairs. He
several times served the people of Black
foot on the City Council, and has had
two years' experience in the office to
which he again aspires.
We have watched his record, and
have no hesitancy in indorsing it anil
supporting him for re-election. He has
stood for good, clean, economical gov
ernment. He is a progressive young
business man, thoroughly familiar with
the various sections of the county and
its needs.
When a man has made good in his
office he should be retained there. Mr.
Bond is the only one of six candidates
for commissioner who has had experi
ence in that office and his knowledge
of the details of the work will be an
incalculable aid to the new board, no
matter which ones should be elected.
The.large number of details requiring
familiarity with the records and pro
eedure in the various duties of the of
fice demand that some of the old board
lie retained. It requires considerable
effort and study to learn the different
lutins of any public office, and one fa
miliar with the work can "Tender more
efficient services than a new man, no'
matter what his natural ability might
be.
A man who lias served in any public
office naturally makes enemies, espec
ially where decisions'have to be uiado
between factions in communities. Aside
from differences arising out of ques
tion of the creation of school districts
Mr. Bond's work seems to have given
entire satisfaction. In school districts
where sentiment is divided bitter feel
ings are sometimes engendered by the
division or refusal to divide a school
district, aad this difference has existed
in Bingham county in various com
munities during the past administra
tion, and has caused some criticism of
the present board, of which Air. Bond is
a member.
Air. Bond has been on the job, con
scientiously performing the duties of
his office at all times since his inaug
uration 011 January 11, 1915, and has
been energetic and honest in his efforts
to serve all of the people of Bingham
county.
We endorse his candidacy and reegjp
mend to the readers of this paper that
lie lie re-elected. We have no doubt
about his uncross on November Till, .11
view of till* high vote he has received
heretofore in the elections and recent
primary.
