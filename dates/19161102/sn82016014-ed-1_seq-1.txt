"Anti-American Sentiment in
Germany Strong" Koenig.
Captain of U-Boat Liner Wined
and Dined by Citizens.
New London, Cor.n., Nov 2. Smil
ing Captain Koenig. skipper of the
preen German submarine freighter
Deutschland, confidently thought to
day he would bo abie to unload his
tin ''"0,000 cargo without interfer
ence from the United States.
He claimed there was no hitch
about this, but Collector of Port Mc
Govern, of Connecticut, evidently
thought different for he hastened to
Hartford yesterday to confer with Sec
retary of the Treasury McAdoo, pre
sumably about the Known jewels and
the stocks and bonds said to be
Aboard. The outcome, of this session
had not been made public early today.
Crew 1-.. . Escape Embraces.
Sleepy New London is wider awake
now than it has been for many a day.
Captain Koenig and his crew are
cheered every time they appear on
the streets. A sixtef n-year-old mem
ber of the crew with several sturdy
fellow members narrowly escaped em
braces from a crowd of handsome
women when they appeared on Main
street today They only edged out
after they had signed autograph
photographs of their boat.
The story goes that when the Scott
tug greeted the Deutschland and in
quired if it wanted a tow, a voice
from aboard the submarine answered:
"No, wa want beer."
Captain Kocnig's talk with newspa
permen left the impression that anti
American feeling is still rather strong
in Germany, tho he hesitatingly said
it wasn't "very bad."

He scoffs at the British blockade.
"It's only a spy system, a chain of
commercial agents," he said. "And if
the British navy comes out, we'll be
ready for them, tho frankly we can't
catch up to England's naval strength
during, the war.
"Germany thinks the war will last
at least another year and it is con
fident of the outcome.
"The submarine is the vessel of the
future. Battleships are no good any
more and anybody who doesn't see
that must wear blinders. I think the

war office.
"The French directed an especially
heavy and destructive fire against
Fort Vaux, which had already
been evacuated during the night by
our troops, following a given order
and witnout being disturbed by the
enemy. Important parts of the fort
were blasted by us berore witnaraw-
al."
(Fort Vaux was the last of the Ver
dun forts remaining in the hands of
the Germans, Fort Douaumont having
been recaptured by the French m
their recent offensive. Dispatches
from the Verdun front Saturday night
declared that Fort Vaux was surround
ed on three sides by the FYench whose
artillery was ringing the fortress with
fire, cutting oft supplies of the Ger
mans.) "North of the Sovnme, artillery ac
tivity was renewed in local actions.
An English advance north of Courcel
lette was easily repulsed.
"French attacks in the sector of
Le3 Bouefs and Rancourt brought
small advantages for the enemy.
Northeast of Morval and on the north
west edge of Pierre Vaast wood the
enemy attacks were generally repulsed
with sanguinary losses. Our troops,
in spite of tenacious French resistance,
made an advarco in the north part of
Sailly.

Fort Vaux was captured by the
Germans on June 6, after a terrific
battle. It occupied a strong position
on the summit of a hill and the
French had repeatedly repulsed
storming attacks up its steep sides.
The Germans systematically reduced
the French defenses by constant ar
tillery Are until the fort was no long
er tenable. Its evacuation by the Ger
mans came on the 252nd day of the
great struggle at Verdun.
Halt East Rumanian Chase.
Fetrograd, Nov. 2. Field Marshal
Mackensen has halted his advance in
Dobrud ja, apparently because of a
shortage of men to protect, his long
line along the River Danube.
Dispatches from Bucharest declare
that Mackensen has been forced to
send several regiments to the Transyl
vanian front to aid Falkenhayn. The
withdrawal of these troops is said to
have checked his offensive operations.
Practically everywhere along the
Transylvanian front except south of
Red Tower Pass, the Rumanians are
holding their own. The Austro-Ger-mans
have been checked in their ad
vance on Campolung but are contin
uing their heavy attacks in the Alt
valley, where the loss of two villages
by the Rumanians was officially con
ceded yesterday.

Injunction Against Collection
This Month.
DON'T PAY YOUR BILLS, ADYICE
President Brown Wants People
to Wait a Few Days.
Mass Meeting Will Be Called
for Public Consideration.
Members of the executive commit
tee of the Topeka Industrial Council
will go before the Shawnee county dis
trict court tomorrow and ask for an
injunction against the local gas com
pany to prevent collecting the new 50
cent gas rate. This injunction, Frarjk
B. Brown, president of the council,
stated today probably will act as a
"blanket" injunction for the entire
city and will keep the people on 28
cent gas temporarily, at least.
"We will ask that the 28-cent rate
set by the utilities commission be the
rate in force," said Mr. Brown today.
"That is, until after the federal court
makes a decision. Meantime, the 50
cent rate will be held in abeyance."
A meeting of the executive commit
tee of the council will be held at 5
o'clock this evening. At that time the
council will instruct an attorney to
prepare the necessary papers asking
tor an injunction against the company
The application for an injunction will
be filed with the Shawnee county dis
trict court tomorrow, if nothing un
foreseen happens.
"Don't Pay lour Bills."
"Don't pay your bills until we ar
rive at some conclusion," President
Brown of the Topeka Industrial coun
cil advised today. "We are going to
hold a big mass meeting possibly
Saturday night. We want the people
to aid us in this fight. We would ad
vise gas users not to settle their gas
bills until they see what can be done.
We will act as quickly as possible in
this matter."

Battery A May Be Ordered
Over Border Soon.
Topeka Boy Says Wilson Wants
a War Now.
Battery A of Topeka may come
home. It may go over the I order into
Mexico as a final climax cf ''he Wilson
campaign. That is the news that came
to Topeka today from a m-n-ber of the
battery. At Eagle Pass, Texas, where
the troops are stationed, there is un
certainty and unrest and watchful
waiting as to the Wilson policies in
the moving of troops.
A Kansas guardsman wrote to his
mother in Topeka concerning the sit
uation on the border. In the letter .'s
a strong indication that the troops will
soon go over the border. Maybe it
will be in a few days. No one knows.
But there is a feeling among the sol
diers that an important move is to be
made this week. There is aHo a feel
ing that the move will be made in a
manner and at a time that will prove
or tne greatest oenerit to tne Wilson
candidacy in the closing hours of the i
presidential campaign.
Recently members of the battery !
have been busy building horse sheds !
at Eagle Pass. With the barns nearly
completed, an order suddenly came to i
cease work. No one understands the 1
meaning of the order. Maybe it means
the troops will soon be sent home. But
with a majority of the guardsmen
there is a feeling that the order means
invasion or Mexico. That is the news
which a Topeka son today sent his
mother. With the uncertainty of the
situation, there is also the feeling that
the move will not be made in a man
ner tending to lose votes for Wilson
in the presidential fight.
The First regiment has been mus
tered out. The Second reeiment is
now at Fort Riley and will be mus
tered out in a few days, it is believed.
But Battery A of Topeka is still sta
tioned at Eagle Pass and will be af
fected by any immediate order from
Washington.

BREACH ISOPENED
Marina Sinking in New Light
Because It Carried Gun.
Right to Carry Arms Sierer Set
tled With Germany.
Washington, Nov. 2. Reopening of
the entire armed merchantman con
troversy between this government and
Germany is certain if it is proved the
British steamer Marina was armed at
the time she was sunk by a German
submarine, statements of Secretary
Lansing indicated today. Whether mer
chantmen have a right to arm for de
fense, is still an open question between
this government and Germany, Lan
sing admitted. This question will be
the principal one if negotiations de
velop with Germany over the death of
six Americans on board the Marina, it
was stated.
While this government has main
tained the right of merchantmen to
arm for defense. Germany has never
admitted It. Ine question first arose
when the Lusitania was sunk. This
government has insisted that mer
chantmen may arm with any guns not
over six inches in caliber. When dis
cussion of the point arose during the
Lusitania negotiations the state de
partment showed the Lusitania was
unarmed, w itnout a recession Dy tnis
government from its position or an ad
mission bv Germany mat mercnant-
men might arm, the question was per
mitted to lapse. .
Germany Issued Statement.
Secretary Lansing said the right of
merchantmen to arm is stil a mooted
question, that there has been no de
cision on it. Germany is expected to
maintain that armed merchantmen
were not Included in her pledges to the
United States.
Secretary Lansing, while he refused
to give out any further details of the
official report of the sinkings from
the American embassy In London, said
his information was substantially the
same as that of the newspaper. Ger
many and Austria on February 10 in
substantially the same terms notified
the United States to the following ef
fect: "Enemy merchantmen armed with
guns no longer have the right to be
considered as peaceable merchant ves
sels of commerce. Therefore the Ger
man naval forces will receive orders
to treat such vessels as belligerents.
"However, in accepting the Ameri
can note on the Sussex demanding the
abandonment of Us submarine war
fare, against "passenger and freight
carrying vessels' Germany said such
vessels should not be sunk without
warning and without providing for the
safety of passengers and crew, 'unless
the ships attempt to escape or offer
resistance.
No condition was made as to armed

Colonel Gets Big Reception To
day In Toledo.
Toledo, Ohio. Nov. 2. Why Presi
dent Wilson should not be re-elected
his pet theme was the subject of
Colonel Roosevelt's speech here at
noon today, when he invaded the
Buckeye state for Hughes rallies here
and at Cleveland. He speaks at Cleve
land tonight.
"President Wilson told us yesterday
in speeches at Buffalo," said Roosevelt,
"that questions Involving human lives
should not be dragged into politics.
Very true. Fine words. Then -.vhy
has he done it?
"Let me give you a homely example.
Suppose A municipal administration
throws a city wide open to vice and
to murderers, thugs and burglars. The
city has no remedy for such a situa
tion, except thru politics. Such a city
administration forces their citizens
who want decent government to re
port to politics. And this is what Mr.
Wilson's administration has forced us
to do."
As a sub-topic, the colonel empha
sized "true Americanism." He quoted
from "Their True Faith and Alle
giance." written by a German-American,
Gustavus Ohlinger of Toledo,
with an introduction by Owen Wister.
The book is a vigorous denunciation
of the foreigner who comes here to
reap the benefits of America's free
government, but fails to give his full
allegiance to the Stars and Stripes.
The colonel got a big reception here.
I He was paraded In state to the hall
where he spoke.
