30 HELP FROM SUBMARINE
i-Boat Stood by While Lifeboats
Capsized and Men Perished in
Heavy Sea.
London, Nov. 1 The loss of Ameri
can lives In the sinking of the Marina
I was increased to seven today, wnen
Wesley Frost, the American Consul at
niipfmtitnwn. telegraphed to the
I American Embassy the name of an-
lother American named urue, as one
lot the victims.
Mr. Frost has procured a joint atit-
davit from the Americans who
reached Crookhaven and a similar
document from American survivors at
ltearhaven. The affidavits agree that
Marina was toruedoes without
warning; that the first torpedo struck
on the starboard side and the second
hit the vessel twelve minutes later
And was followed by a boiler explos
ion, the steamship sinking six minutes
afterward. No Americans were Killed
by the boiler explosion. Those who
lost their lives were drowned as the
lifeboats were launched.
According to this information a sub
tnnrlnft which emerged after the sec
ond torpedo was fired was seen plain
ly by Americans on the Marina, but
did not communicate with the steam
ship or offer assistance to the small
boats, which were in deadly peril
from the rough sea. -1 '
Further affidavits from American
Burvivors say that the vessel had a
4.7 inch gun mounted astern, but that
it was not used, as the ship had no
warning of the submarine attack and
it was too late fter the torpedo bad
hit the vessel. The submarine did not
shell the Marina, tbey say.
It' is regarded here as quite prob
able that the American State Depart
ment will make still further inquiries
with the object of definitely determ
ing status of the Marina. While It is
said that she was under private chart
er when she was torpedoed it appears
that the vessel may have been en
gaged in Admiralty work not long be
fore. Fifteen Americans who reached
Cork Tuesday niht with the other
members of the crew of the Marina
are under the care of the American
Consul.

IRISH BEAT CONSCRIPTION
Australia, However, Determined
. See War to Finish.
to
London, Nov. 1. A despatch to the
Times from Sydnoy says:
"Australia is astonished at the vote
against conscription. It was chiefly
due to the Irish vote against the poli
cy In reprisal for England s failure to
complete home rule negotiations. Al
bo the women flinched before the duty
of sending men to the trenches.
"The voting does not affect Austra
lla's determination to prosecute the

divided regarding the method of rals

BY BERLIN
Last of Verdun Defencee Held By
German Troops
A1TACK5 ON LE TRANSLOY FAIL
Repeated Assaults by Both French
and British Result in Immaterial
Gains.
Berlin, Nov. 2. Fort Vaux, an outer
defence of the city or Verdun, has
been evacuated by the Germans, it is
officially announced today. Vaux was
the last of the Verdun defences in
possession of the German army, Fort
Douaumont having been re-captured
by the French a few days ago. The
Germans blew up much of the wall
before withdrawing from the fort.
Paris, Nov. 1. Le Transloy still
holds out against every effort of
French and British to storm it, but the
French today crept a little nearer this
strongly held village southeast or
Bapaume. Working in cooperation
with the British the French infantry
aptured two trenches southwest of
Le Transloy.
Th struggle for Le Transloy is be
omiiiK one of the most stubborn of
any of the series of desperate fights
lor strong positions that have made
up the Sonime battle. Today the at
tack was made west, south and south
east of the village, and at one point
only success is claimed. The Germans
say the British attack west or the vil
lage reached their trenches, but broke
down after bloody hand to hand fight
ing. Soon after the Le Transloy attack
the French shifted the attack south
east and began what will be a difficult
and costly undertaking, the conquest
of the St. Pierre Vaast wood. They
took a strongly organized and defend
ed German trench system on the
western edge of the wood, which
linked the Saillisel section of Sailly-
Saillisel to the wood. Built in the
form of a crescent and protected ly
double entanglements of barbed wide,
the trench was a serious obstacle.
There will be far more desperate
work in taking the wood, which is
twice as large as the famous Delville ,
. , .1.-. i .1... MI..'..U '
wood that cost the British so dear,
Though most of the larger trees have
been cut down, the small ravines that
run throught the wood make it easily
defensible.
The only other engagements north
of the Sonime were about Suilly-Sail-lisel
early In the day. The Germans
made a very strong attack on this
double village from north and east, in
which wave after wave of infantry
was sent at the position. The French
broke ii) every attack and took seven
ty prisoners.
At Verdun, where there was only a
severe cannonade today, the French
announce tonight that since October
24, a week ago yesterday, when they
n Linuuniiun
suddenly retook strong positions from t enKawd by .1 W. El well & Co ship
the Germans, they have taken 0.011 . P"S commissioners in New York cit.
prisoners. The material taken Is very
large in amount and in value. Fif
teen guns, five of them of large cali
bre; fifty-one trench mortars, 141 ma
chine guns, two wireless plants and a
great quantity of shells, rifles, bombs
and other material have fallen into
French hands as a result of this stun- '
ning blow to the Crown Prince.

PRAISE FOR LOCAL TRAIL
Bennington Section Meets with
Ap-
proval of Appalachian Club.
Allen Chamberlain, Mr.- and Mrs.
Henry G. Chamberlain and R. A. Bul
lock, all of Boston, and members and
officers of the Appalachian club,
which maintains trails all through the
White Mountains, were over the Ben
nington section of the Long Trail re
cently and have since written to a
local hiker, expressing themselves as
being much pleased with It.
They said that the trail is as good
as or better than the average of the
White mountain trails that the red
markers used on the Bennington sec
tion are far superior to the white
markers and white blazes used on the
rest of the trail in Vermont and the
White mountains, and that the only
marker they had seen which might be
compared with them, and which they
did not consider so good, is a light
blue one used on the Sandwich range
of the White mountains.
Members of a party from Plttsfleld
who recently tramped over practically
all or the long trail in this state,
said that the poorest portion of the
Bennington section, the two miles
from the top of Stratton mountain to
the Dufresne job, is better than the
best of the balance of the Long Trail.

DEMOCRATIC COUNTY TICKET
Committee Gives Reason Why Candi
dates Should Be Supported.
Bennington, Vt., Oct. 30th 1916.
T6 the F.ditor of the Banner:
The national campaign seems to be
the subject most prominent In the
minds of the voters at this time and it
seems that we are entirely forgetting
our local, county and state offices and
it is for this reason "that w e wish to
call your attention and also the atten
tion of tho voters of the county of
Bennington to the men who are our
candidates for the various County
offices. Many of tnese candidates are
making their first appeal to the voter3
of Bennington County whlio their op
ponents year aftsr year have asked
the voters to elect and re-elect them.
Isn't it time that we had a change and
elected new men whom we fell are
more competent to fill tnese positions
and who are beyond Hie control of any
political boss or political ring. We
urge the voters of Bennington County
to compare man for man the candi
dates and ask them if the following
list is not the strongest and best and
entitled to receive their support at
the polls.
For Senator. John P. Morrissey of
Renniugton. Mr. Morrissey is one of
Bennington's promising young men,
has beon employed nearly all his Hie
in the Cooper Machine Works, has
served two terms as Trustee of the
Village of Bennington and has been
re elected for a third term, was one of
the incorporators of the Henry W.
Putnam Memorial Hospital and is at
this time one of the Trustees and
Auditor, has always been a friend of
the laboring man and would make an
especially strong champion of their
cause in the next Senate, he has al
ways been a booster of Bennington
County and deeply interested in all
that appertained thereto and should
bo elected.
For Senator, James W. Tynan of
Arlington. Mr. Tynan needs no intro
duction to the voters of Bennington
County, his record is above reproach,
as school director for many years, as
selectman for 12 years, he has proven
himself a most faithful public servant
and though at times declining offices
tendered him, when called upon, has
always responded and the voters of
his town will testify to bis ability. His
business life as contractor and builder
has made him one of the big forces in
the north shire and his natural ability
fits him to ably represent Bennington
County in the Senate when it needs a
man to bring more prestige to Ben
nington County. And Mr. Tynan
should be elected.
For Assistant Judge of the County
Court. James Beebo of Kast Dorset,
for many years engaged in farming,
has held many of the town, offices, as
lister and constable he tilled the of
fices with satisfaction to his home peo
ple, and he has been Representative to
the General Assembly for two terms,
such faith and esteem placed in this
man by the people who know him best
most certainly entitles him to the sup
port of the voters of Bennington
County and he should be elected.
For Assistant Judge of the County
Court Johnson Mattison of Benning
ton, formerly of Shattsbury, one of the
most extensive farmers and land
owners in the town of Shattsbury.
born, reared and lived nearly his en
tire life In that town and is one of the
best known men in Bennington coun
ty. A man of ability, honesty of pur
pose, and integrity, and a man who
has the interests ot Bennington Coun
ty at heart, and should be elected.
While we deplore the system wiiicli
allows tho Assistant Judges of our
County Courts to appoint license com
missioners we can guarantee to the
voters of Bennington County that
James Beebe and Johnson M. Matti
son will fill these offices and perform
these duties with out fear or favor of
any man.
For Sheriff Frank Regan of Man
chester, a young man of ability,
active, agressive and determined, and
especially fitted for the position of
Shtrirr of Hennington i.ouniy. ne
had been tax collector of the village of
Manchester and is at present mana
ger of Carsen Inn at Manchester,
which position has given him a very
wide acquaintance not only in Ben
nington County but elsewhere. We
feel that it would be a great misfor
tune to the voters of Bennington Coun
ty if they failed to avail themselves
of the opportunity to elect Mr. Regan
as Sheriff. We believe that Benning
ton County needs a young, agressive
and determined man to till this high
office end Mr. Regan is capable and
tills every requirement and should be
elected.
For High Baliff Truman II: Mixti
ons of Woodford a young man of abil
ity, probably one of the best known
ycung men in Bennington County. As
a farmer and afterwards engaged In
the sale of farm machinery also In the
automobile business he has been most
successful. Capable and honest ho
can and will fill this office if elected
with honor to himself and to the
County and should be elected.
John VanDerSpelgel Merrill, tho
candidate for Judge of Probate for the
District of Bennington was born in
Bennington as were his father and
mother. Mr. Merrill was admitted to
the Bar 17 years ago and his law office
has always been Room 2, Savings
Bank Building. Mr. Merrill is wdl
grounded In the common law and to
the amendments thereto ns applied to
Probate practice. Mr. Merrill is so

Be Starved into Evacuating
the City.
El Paso, Tex., Nov. 2. Twenty-
eight Mexicans In the de facto govern

on the Mexican t entrai railroad aim
butchered at Laguna and 400 passeng
ers were lined up and robbed by a
band of 200 Villistas Monday, accord
ing tot information received here by
Consul Soriano Bravo. The town of
Laguna Is 150 miles directly south of
the border.
El Paso, Tex., Nov. 1. Railroad and
telegraph communications between
Chihuahua city and the border have
been interrupted and Chihuahua city
is now isolated, as the railroad has
been destroyed north, south and west
of tho Chihuahua State capital. All
train service between Juarez and
huahua city has been annulled.
American army otlicers here
clared today that Gen. Trevino
Chi-
de
and the Carranza garrison in Chihuahua
city would soon 'be forced to evacuate
the city if the railroad lines north and
south of Chihuahua city remained cut.
Food supplies are reported to be
scarce in Chihuahut city. and Gen.
Trevino has been depending upon
shipments from t he border to feed his
soldiers. With the road between
Juarez and Chihuahua city cut this is
no longer possible, and nothing can be
obtained from the south tnd west for
tbe same reason.
Mexican officials admitted today
that the railroad and telegraph be
tween Juarez and Chihuahua city had
been cut, but minimized it with the
declaration that a small band of "un
organized bandits" did the work. The
information of American military
men, however, is to the fleet that a
p-art of Villa's men have cut In around
Chihuahua city on the north and cut
the track, co-operating with others of
the band who are reported to have de
stroyed the railroads south and west
of the State capital.

Many Contestants Take Part in
Unique Contest
FIVE AWARDS JUST ANNOUNCED
Competitors Showed Ingenuity in
Selection of Materials to Build
Homes for Feathered Songsters
The piizes in the contest for bird
house building have been awarded as
follows:
1st prizes, $1.50 each Roland Hun
ter and Edward Wood.
2nd prizes, $.75 each Ellis Chase,
Joseph Drohart, Alexander Drysdale.
The conditions of the contest, as
announced last spring, were that each
boy should build his own bird-house,
that the house should be occupied by
a bird other than an English Sparrow
or a starling and that a family of
young should be raised.
A large number of boys throughout
the town entered the contest and so
many extremely -practical, as well as
ornamental, bird-houses were built
that it has been very difficult to de
cide which should receive the prizes.
Great ingenuity was shown among
the contestants in utilizing materials
at hand in the construction of the
houses. One boy used a butter box,
another granite noting paper, and
two others, tar paper all of these
were occupied by blue-birds. Several
of the boys put up more than one
house and one family became so inter
ested that with the father's aid two
hoys constructed ten houses.
Altogether, it was a pleasure to
know that so many comfortable and
attractive homes were furnished for
the birds of Bennington.
