was a severe defeat for the locals there
was a great deal of enthusiasm and
spirit evidenced on the part of the
student body and villagers. A fairly
good turnout was present for the
battle. This fact above all others en
dorses the years work at football as
successful, having aroused sufficient
interest among the citizens to have its
efforts backed. The boys who play on
the team realize that they have not
suffered humiliation in vain. A great
discipline is gained by playing on the
team and especially on a losing team.
Not one among the spectators uould
claim that the sort of rugby played by
the locals was not the clean, snappy
sort that shows a knowledge and prac
tise of the right principles of the game.
Yale High was outweighed approxi
mately 18 pounds to the man and found
it impossible to gain by line plunging
or to prevent downs being made
through their ranks without bodily
ri6k. This was necessitated and carried
out effectively in the third quarter.
Offensively Yale was forced to resort
to open plays which threatened to
work effectively in the first half. Tice,
VanNorman and Adams starred on
offense and Williams with his team
mates played exceptional defense
against the odds.

Senior Party
The masquerade party giveu by the
members ot the Senior class last Fri
day evening in Central hall was a huge
success, and incidentally added some
dollars to their coffers.
Probably a hundred and fifty were
present, all garbed in quaiut costumes
and masked, making an extremely ef
fective scene. There was every variety
ot character imaginable, some very
pretty costumes being shown, others
unique and grotesque, but all adding
to the charm of the evening's enjoy
ment. Amusements of different sorts were
enjoyed. The fortune teller's corner
received a good share of attention and
the cider and doughnut counter was
well patronised. Later in the evening
dancing was indulged in and a lunch
was Eervcd about midnight.
Everybody appeared to have a good
time, spectators included.

lhau ever before, would be shipped
luto the united Mates and com- in
competition with goods made by our
well paid workmen. ,He advised his
hearers to consider the matter wisely be
fore casting a ballot to continue the
present administration.
We would like to publish Congress
man Cramton's speech in full, but time
and space will not allow us to do so.
Mr. Lincoln Avery was called upon
and delivered an address that should
go to the hearts of every voter and set
them to thinking. He stated that he
was a republican because he believed

party. His talk was interesting and
well received by his hearers.
Mr. L. A. Holmes, candidate for state

PREPARE THE
CHILDREN FOR i
LATER YEARS
fHERE 13 no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Mrs. Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many homes education and
training depend upon how much the parents can afford to
spend.
What about Your Boy and Girl?
Will Willie have to forego his dreams of being civil engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training she baa been
looking forward to? Will they be compelled after school
years are passed to take their places with the underpaid men
and women, untrained, without a vocation?
Plan now, when they are young. Dank your money or better still, de
posit a little to their credit in this bank regularly, and when the time
comet there will be no necescary LirapingM to start them off right.
