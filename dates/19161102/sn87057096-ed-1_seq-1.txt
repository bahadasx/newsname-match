business of the term.
The grand jury completed their

At this session they returned six in

Two jury cases were tried at this
term of court, that of J. B. DeBolt vs.
German American Ins. Co., over a
policy on a store owned by plaintiff
at Tuskeego,'which was destroyed by
fire, the insurance company setting
up the claim that they did not know
there was other insurance on the
stock and therefore was not liable.
The plaintiff was represented by V.

the jury Friday evening and they
reached a verdict that night, giving
plaintiff judgment for $1,788.05 on
his policy.

The Best Sale of the Season.
It is seldom that a postponed sale
is extra good, but the big closing out
sale of W. H. SnyJer held at his
farm seven miles northeast of Leon,
on last Thursday, having been post
poned from the previous FrJjday on
account of the storm on that day,
prices of the year secured. A team

$425.00, cows sold for from $80 to
$90 a head, spring calves up to
$46.50, and sh'eep went out of eight,
ewes selling for $16 a head and buck
lambs for $23. The three auction
eers, C. A. McKern, Loren Tullis and
D. A. xvicMains worked like beavers
and Mr. Snyder was mighty well
pleased with the result of the sale,
as it netted him over a thousand dol
lars more than he had figured on.
Col. McMains, one of the veteran
auctioneers of southern Iowa, said it
was the best Qctober sale he ever
saw, and broke all prices for sales.
Mr. Snyder had a big crowd at the
sale, treated everybody royally, and
everything passed off smoothly.

Fay Macy, who lives two miles
north of Leon, drove his horse and
buggy to Garden'Grove last Wednes
day evening to visit his' sister, Mrs.
A. E. Northrup, and tied the horse to
a hitch rack in Garden Grove. When

horse and buggy were gone and no
one could be found who had seen it.
The phone was used on Thursday,
and sheriff Lorey was notified, but
as no trace could be found of it Fay
came to the concision that it had
been stolen. Late Friday evening
the horse was found in a corn field
on the Briley iarm two miles west

one, and nad started for home, and
got into the corn field. The animal
was reined up so it could not get its
head down, so could neither eat or
drink, and it had wandered all over
the corn field, breaking down a large
amount of corn. The new buggy was
pretty badly damaged, as the horse
had walked under a tree and torn the

ALBIA HAS BAD FiRE.
Bryant's Ready-to-Wear Store Ruin
ed by Fire, Water and Smoke.
The following account of a heavy
loss by fire at the store of J. F.
Bryant, of Albia, is taken from Tues
day's Albia. Union. Mr. Bryant is
well known in Leon, his wife being
a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. R,
Moore of this city:
About twelve o'clock Saturday
night Bryant's ready-to-wear store
was discovered to be on fire and the
department and citizens responded
promptly and lost no time in subdu
ing the flames which had gained con
siderable headway before being dis
covered.
From the general appearance of
the room the fire originated from
electric wires in the ceiling which
are concealed from view and there
was no sign of fire when the store
was closed for the night. From the
ceiling the^jhe dropped onto some
wearing apfRel in the fitting room
and worked its way to the front part
of the store room destroying gooas
and ruining the fixtures and also the
plate glass in the show windows. The
fire is a serious matter to Mr. Bryant
as the goods not burned are badly
damaged by water and smoke and
are almost worthless. His loss will
be from $15,000 to $20,000, with
$10,000 insurance on the goods but
none on the fixtures and other furni
ture.
The building and part of the fix
tures are owned by Judge D. M. An
derson and the damage sustained is
fully covered by insurance.
Lambert's jewelry slock and furni
ture was damaged by smoke. On the
Becond. floor the furniture and house
hold goods belonging to Dr. Hols
claw and Mr. and Mrs. Edwards were
damaged by heat and smoke and
their loss is covered by insurance.
As soon as the loss is adjusted Mr.
Bryant will resume business and take
care for his patrons as though he had
not met with a serious loss.
Grand River's Reporters Were Delay
ed.
The Reporter office was kept busy
the latter part of last week answer

at Grand River- as to why they did
not receive their Reporter. The three
big bundles of Reporters for Grand
River were mailed as usual on Wed
nesday evening and should have
reached Grand River early Thursday
morning. We finally got the papers
located and they reached Grand Riv
er we hope Saturday afternoon. A
new baggageman at the Leon depot
allowed the sack- for Grand River to
sent it to Cainesville on the freight
It came back Friday morning, and
instead of sending it to Grand River
Friday afternoon he kept it in the
depot and claimed he sent it out Sat
urday morning, and it must have
been delayed on the way as we were
infornfed by the postmaster at Grand
River that he did not receive the
papers Saturday on the morning
train. The delay was no fault of the
Reporter office, and we did not have
extra copies so we could iiot dupli
cate the list.

i20 Pigs from Six Sows in Six Months
Ed Owens, of Woodland town

farrowed 120 pigs within six months,

John Barrymore as "The Incorrigible
Dukane," Friday, and Mary Pick
ford in "Esmeralda," Monday.
Two big specials for Friday and
Monday at the Idle Hour theatre.
Friday John Barrymore appears in
an elaborate picturization of tfye
melodramatic comedy, "The Incor
rigible Dukane," The story follows:
"The Incorrigible Dukane," a
unique combination of drama, com
edy and romance, by George C. Shedd
provides John Barymore, the popular
stage and film favorite, with one of
the most unusual characterizations
he has yet impersonated on the
s.creen.
The comedy of the subject is de
rived from a series of ludicrous mis
fortunes of which the young and in
corrigible Dukane is the constant
victim the drama emanates from the
thrilling manner in which the young
ne'er-do-well redeems himself, and
saves the fortune and honor of his
father and the romance develops—
in the usual manner of youth. These
varying elements of photoplay com
position effectively prove-the versal
ity of John Barrymore, inimitable in
his comedy scenes, impressive in the
dramatic situations in which he finds
himself, and truly lovable as a lover.
On Monday the popular Mary
Pickford returns to present Frances
Hodgson Burnett's famous human
drama, "Esmeralda," All that Is
necessary to say is that Mary Pick
ford plays the leading role. The story
of the play is as follows:
Of all the great dramatic success
es of Frances Hodgson Burnett, "Es
meralda," is the most tender and
lpvable characterization ever creat
ed by this gifted author. As "Es
meralda, Mary Pickford renders one
of the most touching and sympathet
ic screen impersonations of the year.
The strong attachment for home, "be
it ever so humble," which this ap
pealing drama extols, the simple but
great love which it unfolds, and its
dominant human note, have made its,
success on the stage endure for two
generations. As a photoplay, "Es
meralda" is a faithful presentation
of the beautiful and noble sentiments
of the beloved play, in which Mary
Pickford, assisted by an unusually
strong supporting cast attains anoth
er remarkable triumph.
Matinees at 3 o'clock, first night
shows at 7:15. Admission 10 and 15
