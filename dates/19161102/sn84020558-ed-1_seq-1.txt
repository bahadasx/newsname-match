WASHINGTON,
P. Leased Wire
Nov. . So mini
conflicting elements have appeared in
the destruction of the British ship Ma
rina by a German submarine, with the
loss of American lives, that the inci
dent threatens to fall into a technical
discussion rather than a clean-cut is
sue of whether Germany has violated
her pledges to the United States.
It became apparent today, both from
the attitude of the state department
and from foreign dispatches, that most
which Is essential to a determination of
the responsibility remains undisclosed,
if. indeed, the United States. Germany
or Great Britain is in possession ol th"
full facts.
It appeared certain no move will be
made by the United States until the
German government's aversion of the
affair is received.
The only positive developments todav
were the action of Count von Beru
storff, the German ambassador, in ask
ing his government to forward fuil de
tails by wireless and the issuance f.f a.
statement by Secretary Lansing that
the investigation would be in no wise
delayed because there is a political
campaign in progress. This was Mr.
Lansing's statement:
"The fact that political campaign Is
in progress will in no way effect the
practice of the department in negoti
ating and in making fuil investigation
of cases of this sort. We shall do it as
we always have with as much celerity
as possible.
"I wish also to make another state
ment on a matter which has ben;
brought to rny attention. The oiiestiop.
has been raised as to whether the pol
icy of the president or the department
in regard to submarine warfare since
the Sussex was sunk has been changed.
I wish to say emphatically that tlx-rn
has been no change in no particular."
' Secy. Ionising made it plain also that
no decisive action wouid be taken until
Germany had had opportunity to rep!y
to the inquiry for further version of
her attack on the Marina and Rowan
more. The instructions sent to the em
bassy at Berlin were said to ask for
an investigation by Germany ami not
for an explanation. It was not meant
to indicate tiiat the United SL.t-s be
lieved that it had any proof tiiat Ger
many had violated her pledgfs.
While they await full details, two
outstanding facts attracted the atten
tion of officials line was the m
liouncement that tile .Marina was
armed with a 4.7 inch gun mounted
astern: the other was a news dispatch
from London, th" language of which
was regarded as significant. It said:
"It is regarded here as quite pro'.
able that the American state depart
ment will make still further inquiries
with the object of determining i!e:i-
nitelv the status of the Marina. Wh
it is said that she was under pr;'
charter when she was torpedoed, if
pears that the vessel may have
gaged in admiralty work not long
fore."
This was generally construed as
fleeting some indications of doui.t in
London, whether t'.1e ship was entitle. 1
to the immunities of -i peaceful mer
chantman. The United States government, how
ever, never has altered its policy of re
garding merchant ships, temporarily in
admiralty service, as merchant shoes
still unless they have been actually
taken over by a belligerent navy and
manned with a naval crew.
The question of the Marina's arma
ment, however, is likely to become the
point on which the case will revlove
unless other circumstances arise dear
ly to define other issues. It brings
the submarine question back to a po.nt
where Germany and the United States
have held opposite views. Germany
has steadfastly contended that in view
of the novel conditions surrounding
submarine warfare and m view of the
British admiralty's alleged instructions
to merchant captains to destroy er.r-my
suhmarines. any armed ship was liable
to destruction on sight and without
warning.
Tile position of the Unite States
was clearly defined to all the lielbger
ents In the formal memorandum of
March 2r, lsBS. Some of the signifi-
(Contlnued on Pare Two:
The statement in part follows:
"Numerous reports have been made,
of conspiracies to threaten and in
timidate employes in voting i.s the
employer wishes. It is claimed that,
for the purpose of intimidating, a
certain factory in Indiana has caused
letters to be written o employes no
tifying I hem to join a particular po
litical club and to sign their names
as members thereof; tn another in
stance that certain employers will re
fuse to permit men who wish to vot-"
for a particular candidate the priv
ilege of a few hours off to vote, but
f they wish to vote for the employ
er's choice they may have the time.
It is further reported that one plant
in northern Indiana has informed em
ployes that, if selected on election
boarelp by a certain party, they shall
have the privilege of serving, but if
selected by another party they are
forbidden.
"Without attempting to state what
facts do or do not constitute threats;
anil .intimidations, the law is plain
that if men conspire to prevent an
etrq fcvye from exercising the free
privilege of voting for whom he
pleases for federal office, it is a di
rect violation of section 1 of the
Uni"d States criminal code.
'The investigation is not confined
to threats and intimidations, but ex
tends t ail violations ot which the
United States takes cognizance.
Agents have been assigned to inves
tigate reports of fraudulent registra
tions, colonization of voters, the use
of money and the corruption of elec
tion boards."
