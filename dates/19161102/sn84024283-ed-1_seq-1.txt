IRONTON, MO., THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2t 1916.
NUMBER 22.
Address Register, Ironton, Mo
From St Louis.
Tt h.A been several weeks since I
wrote a letter to the Register. Then
I wrote from "Near Arcadia Heights."
My son, Otto, and I left Ironton
Thursday, October 19, on train No. 10,
arriving in St. Lonis before noon. We
did not have any trooble in petting
jobs: both going to work at 8:00 A. M.
the next day. Otto runs an electno
elevator in one of the largest manu
facturing plants in St. Louis, while
your writer has, work in the same
plant, in the shipping department.
We have a fairly good room on Broad
way, at 1.60 per week, and can live
almost as cheaply as if at home. But,
when we received a letter from home
stating that "there were four or five
gallons of good rich milk standing in
vessels, and plenty of butter (you
know, Bro. Ake, what country butter,
as yellow as gold, is) it makes my
heart long for "home, sweet home."
Of course, we get milk and butter here
-occasionally, but not the real good
kind we get at home. .
Your writer when he was here in
Rantambar worked in the Boston De-
' partment Store, one of the largest
general stores on Broadway; but the
wages paid, and the fact that I had to
,b- nn Wednesday nights and Satur
days nights until 9 :00 a.m. (other days,
however, from 8 A. m. until B:ou p. m.)
caused me to voluntarily resign my
coition Tt la a fact simply as
tounding how little the average clerks

h.t. mmv of them were receiving
only from $10 to 912 per week. Your
.ito, had the watch all right, but
that diamond shirt-stud was too rich-
for him. Then, again that cash system,

more that I worked in a ary gooas
store, vears ago, when each clerk did

v One might say all this is old fogyism;
he that as it may, "how dear to my
koai nr the thines of my childhood.'
-Dooiiir when one reaches even the
' fifHAth mile-stone alone life's journey
tin dnAH not take verv readily to the
fancied styles, business methods

visit of several so-called high schools

such is really unoalled for and un

system of thingsis not yet; for "truth

- We were very much impressed with
a meeting conciuctea mis auernoon
u u number of the Silvation Army
workers, on Market street. It brought
tears to my eyes, and called to my
mind the "old time religion" of my
boyhood days. But it appears that
we have out-lived that system of

Board of St. Louis city recently an
... nonnced the discovery that the Re
nnblican administration of that over1
burdened municipality is expending
one million dollars a year for salaries
of useless clerks and ofiloers who
either render no service at all or
whose services are not needed by the
city. Missouri tax-payers are invited
to seriously consider this expression
of Republican economy, this practical
exemplioation of the doctrine of Rob
Roy . :
"ttilt they should take who have the
' power . ..
And th,ey should keep who can."
Under laws enacted by Democrats,
the State of Missouri Is drawing hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in inter
est on the State deposits. In the old
days of Republican rule ' the State
fund were farmed ont at the pleasure
' , of the State Treasurer, who put the
, interest in his pocket and kept it.
' Republican newspapers are not say
i .Ing so much about "nepotism," since
it, was discovered that the Republican
