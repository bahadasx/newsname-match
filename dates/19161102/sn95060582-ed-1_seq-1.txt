SPKINGERVILLE LETTER5.
Big Church Doin$if In Springerville., The
Lady Aidew "To B Or No't.To Be,
That 1$ The Question.
"Rev. Miller called the members
of the Presbyterian Church and
The Lady Aiders together Wed
nesday night to let them know
what the Ladies Aid Society was
and what it was working for.
Non Church members have gotten
in control of the society and are
trying to slip one over . lhe
Presiding Elder and the Minister
told the ladies just where they
stood, as far as the church is con
cerned. In short, The Ladies Aid
Society of the Presbyterian
Church of Springerville, Arizona
is going to be run by the Church,
for the Church, and not by offi
cers of the society alone, for the
good of what they think is just
the right thing".
Only a few members were pres
ent to face Rev. Miller but the
ones whom were there, spoke
' 'straight out and told him a few
things". Rev. Miller told them
that he was going to be at their
next meeting, whether invited or
not. He had never been invited
to one of the meetings but is go
ing to "butt in" and hflp them
run things in the Lord's way.
The by-laws were read and ex
plained to those present, and the
Minister's attention was called to
an ammendment "written down
in black and white" which says
"The lady who drops out of the
society shall be made to pay both
dues and fines until she sends in
a written resignation," Rev.
Miller wanted to know who was
going to collect those dues and
fines; he might get the same per-,
son to help him out.
It was positively stated that
"two of the officers would drop
out" and that "some of the Lady
Aiders" would have j'oined the
Church if this trouble had not
come up", Rev. Miller had sug
gested that a stereoptieon be pur
chased with some of the lady aid
money and this was afterwards
discussed by some of the mem
bers. One of the ladies said that
the Rev. Miller wanted to buy a
"stereoptieon" and another spoke
up and said "it is not, its a magic
lan tern. ' ' Further developments
will be awaited with interest.
Later:
Tourist flying both ways to and
from Springerville, to get ahead
of the snows etc. etc. etc.
ivir. ana Mrs. btewart n;awara
White passed through here on
their way home after about three
weeks hunting in the White
Mountains. Mr. White reports a
scarcity of game, but then he is
used to hunting in Africa. Those
who read Mr. White's recent story
"The Leopard Woman" in the
Saturday Evening Post will now
agree that Mr. White has had
"some big hunt" in that Dark
country.
Among those in town to take
the Ranger's Examination in the
Forestry Service were Vain and
Roy Snyder, and Roy Swapp.
Julius Becker went to Albuquer
que on business for the Becker
Mercantile Company.
Des Royal has moved his bar
ber shop next door to Speck & Co.
which building is j'ust being re
modeled. Some of our esteemed citizens
who have been "riding the Water
Wagon" have dropped the whip
while others have lost the whole
hind wheel.
The Ladies Aid Society of the
Presbyterian Church of Springer
ville, Arizona met at Mrs. Beck
er's residence last Thursday, the
Minister and Elder being among
those present.
