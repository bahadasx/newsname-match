Berlin Says Proposal Aims
at Anglo Ameriean
World Mastery
Herhn. Nov. 1. President Wilson's
speech at Cincinnati last Thursday Ifl
printed at considerable length to-day,
and has heen received by the na?ra*
papers with varyinf* degrees of com- j
ment. Some express the belief that his
BUgfflfltlofl of the necessity for a "so?
ciety of nations" is simplv unworkable
nntl inpraeticahlfl. Others declare the
league proposal is inspired by am?
bition for Anglo-American mastery 'if
the world.
Newspaper.-- like the "I.okal Anzeig- '
er" think that the carrying out of
President Wilson's ideas would actual?
ly provoke rather than hinder war in
the future, and insist that the oft
repeated dctermination of the Fntento
Allies to annihilate the Central Powers
constitutes on the very face of things
an insurtnountable ohstacle. The "Lo
kal Anzeiger" advi*es President Wil?
son to induce (ireat Hritain to alter
raa ifl this direction if he does
not wish to lay himself open to the
nu.?picion of lust for world-power.
The "Kreuc Zeitung" is especially
su>picious of the sinnlarity in time and
contents of th? t,pecchcs of President
Wilson and Viscount Crey, the British
Foreign Secretary. It says the speech
of President Wilson betokens for
Americans "membership in the Knglish

The "Tages Zeitung" sa>s Pre
WiUaa'a appeal to America to abstain
from aajrthiag that might weaken Efl
iftflr the war is il'.ogical and
should have been made in August, l'.'l-J.
The "Boersrn Zeitung" agrees with
Ptaflidaat Wilson that mutual suspi
cions played their part in causing the
pre>cnt war, but expresses the fear that
they cannot be prevented fnm causing
future wars.

SEES "MENACE
TO PUBLIC PEACE"
Crowds in Buffalo Small
est He Has Had During
the Campaign
[afraaa a Btaf Oanaaaaaflaal af rh. Tr.iunal
BurTalo, Nov. 1. President Wilson in
two speeches here to-day vigorously
assailed Mr. Hughes and Theodore
Roosevelt for attempting to drag for-,
eign affairs into domestic politics. Al- j
though the PresidentA following his i
custom, did not menfion either by j
name, his language made it plain that
bfl referred their recent criticisms.
The President condemned such criti- |
cism as "partisan" and "unpatnotic."
He denounced political leaders "who
never heed any council" and "believe
they have a special union with Divine
Providence."
"I want to register my solemn pro
test," declared the President in his?ld
dress at the Kllicott Club, "against the
use of our foreign relatjonshafs for po?
litical advantage. I caAnot, I will not,
regard any man as a patriot who does
that men who in the midst of the most
critical relationships, the detaila of
which they do not know, make play
arith the loss of the bvea of Ameriean
citizens even in order that they may
create a domestic political advantage."
"Menace to Public Peace"
I'sing political partica for such blind
partisanship. the President declared
was a "menace to public peace" and a
misusc of parties for the advantage of
the organization rather that the benefit
of the nation.
This [a the nearest approach Presi?
dent Wilsor. has made to answering tha
criticisms of Colonel Roosevelt on the
Administration's foreign policy. It
was evident from his tone that Roose
v.lt's attacks have at last got beneath
the ?urfr.ce.
?'[ eould mention fellow citizens ot
ours," declared the President, with em
phasis, which the crowd at once under
took to apply I" Colonel Roosevelt.
"who never heed any council except the
internal mentor which they have come
to believe has a special union with
Divine Providence. But they do not
(flt very far, and we do with them e.\
act y what we ought to tlo. We en
courage them to talk. If you have a
friend about whom you are in doubt as
:., whether he is a fool or not, who has
large nnd expansivc opinions, encour
ape him to hire a hall. The minute
these views are exposed to the air nat
ure will take care of them."
Big Crowd at Night
"Foreign nations think we are di*
rideeY* said the President at the
Broadway auditonum in the evening.
"lt ifl oji duty to prove that we are
united. About that we cannot pu'
up anv lilutT."
Theasaada loughl tfl gaifl fldaiiflfliflfl
to the auditorium, and it took the
police nearly half an hour to quiet
the di-order cau-ed by hundreds who
Itaad ia the aifllflfl and refused to be
moved. Th" hall seated 9A*9 per
lOBfl, and nearly half as many more
stood. They applauded the Presi
deat'i pi**? f?r ftaattt flaaatlaaal edu
eatiflB. simplihed procedure lfl the
couris and the eiicht-hour day.
With thousands of Bulfalo'.- "hyphenx"
in the audience the President scized
the opporUnity to pound home again
demands for a united America. Much
of his speech was devoted to thia
tightening of the bonds, not merely
..etween citizens of all foreign na
tieaatitiflfl, but between all classe- of
the nation and of the community.
Should Not bayiisled
Foreign nation*. the President said,
ba raiflled by the "Balflfl*- of
the presflflt campaign into believing
that part of the natio-n had ita heart
"outsiue America." N'o matter how
loud the voices of those who sought to
involve us in Kurope's war. he said.
America would never al'.ow herself to
:;e drawn latfl a quarrel against which
she had set her face
"We are not going to be drawn into
quarrels which mean nothing to #us.
SVe are not interested in seeingone na?
tion or group flf nations prevail against

"?Wfl are r.ot afraid tfl fight and we
are no't di.-mclined to Bffct for the
things that America stands for.
"We are waiting for the call we have
always waited for. We have fought
for humanity. Cod forbid that we
should ever tight for self-satisfaction
or for aggression."
The leudcat cheers of the evening in
terrupted, showing that "peace" waa
the Presider.t's strongflflt claim on the
audience.

vigorously by Mr. Hughea were alao

LA FOLLETTE CAN
SWING WISCONSIN
Sure of Reelection?Stal

for Hughes
By J?. H. EVANS
Madison, Wis., Nov. 1.-According to
one of the most recently made citirens
of Wisconsin. the difference between a
king and a Governor or President is
simple: "A king ban have steady
yob."
If there were a king ln Wisconsin
his name would he King Bob. Really.
he isn't a king. but a majority of the
citizens of Wisconsin have given him
a steady "yob" for tifteen years, and
they are about to extend his tenure
Whoever is elected President, Robert
Marion La Follette will be I'nited
Statea Senator.
U'hen one has surveyed the politi-i
cal situation in several typical cities
and tOWBB in Wisconsin and has east
hooks into unknown waters to angle
for the ailaat farmer vote i decisive in |
thia state) and comes at last to the
capital city. more and more is forced
upon the mind the conclusion that as
between Hughes and Wilson Wiscon?
sin is teetering on the fence and may
fall on either side.
U Follette Sure to Win
The state is not doubtful so far as
La Follette is concerned. Fven his
hitterest enemies of the "j'talwart Re- ;
{.ublicans admit he will win. There |
in less doubt about th? Uovernorehi*..
The Democrats practically concede the
leelection of Emanuel L Philipp.
I hilipp will run rirst, La Follette sec
, nd, Hughes third. Philipp will get
r.ll the Republican votes, La Follette
expects to go about 50-50 as between
Halfbreeds and Democrats of the Wil?
son stripe, and Hughes is the puzzle.
Hughes is sure of practically all of
the Stalwart Republieanr,.'" although
.ome of them are not. over-enthusi
astic because of disappointment in the
campaign. Many of them wanted
Flihu Root nomina?ed. Not a few in
the small towns and cities are shying '
because of rabid talk in the news-;
papers -bout '?German-Amencan"
.support of Hughes.
Nohody venturcs to predict what
proportion of the Halfbreed Republi?
eans, followers of La Follette, Hughes
will get. The attitude of La Follette
was an influence t* hcrd them into the
Wilson camp until he attacked Wil?
son last night. Now little defection
is expected, and to offset it there are
a feu thousand Democrats m the

President Wilson in a speech to
night before 12,000 persons in the

said. as emphatically as he eould ex
praafl himself:
"I understand that word has gone
out through labor cirrles in official
channels to vote against me, and I
know perfectly well that I am saymg
a profound truth, and eve.-y union
lalwr man knows it?that nobody
can direct or control the labor vote

the utmost confidence in the freedom
