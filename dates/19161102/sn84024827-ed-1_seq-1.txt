INDIANAPOLIS. Nov. 1. Frank C.
Dailey, special assistant U. S. Attor
ney, appointed to prosecute alleged
election law violations in Ohio, Illi
nois and Indiana, issued a warning
to men "who have engaged in ar
rangements to threaten and intimi
date employes in the matter of vot
ing for federal officers without know
ledge that their acts constitute a vio
lation of the federal laws."
The statement In part follows:
Bosses Bully Voters
"Numerous reports have been
made' of conspiracies to threaten
and Intimidate employes into vot
ing as the employer wishes. It is
claimed that, for the purpose of
intimidating a certain factory in
. .Indiana has caused leters, to be
written to employes notifying .
them to join a particular political
club and to sign their names as
members thereof; in another in
stance that' certain' employes will
refuse to permit men who wish
to vote for a particular candidate
to have the privilege of a few
hours off to vote, but if they wish
to vote the employer's choice,
they may have the time.
"It is further reported that one
plant in northern -Indiana has in
formed employes that, if selected
on' election boards by a certain
party, they shall have the privi
lege of serving, but if selected by
another party they are forbidden.
Criminal Offense
"Without attempting to state what
facts do or do not constitute threats
and Intimidation, the law is plain that i
if men conspire to prevent an em-I
ploye from exercising the free prfvl-j
lege of voting for whom he pleases
for federal officers! it is a direct vio
lation of the criminal code."
. Other Graft Suspected
The investigation is confined to
threats and intimidations, but extends
to all violations of which the United
States takes cognizance. Agents have
been assigned to investigate reports
of fraudulent registration, coloniza
tion of voters, the use of money and
the corruption of election boards.

Mr. Hughes made five speeches to

the Adamson law, and expressed the
belief that be would win. He spoke

"The uncertainty of the law is rec

"I note that the chief of one of the

tained the effect of the law on those

makes a. hundred mile run in five
hours instead of getting his full day's

day's pay when paid on the eight hour
basis. He also says that formerly the
railroad men were entitled to pay for
23 miles whenever called out. wheth

not. But the Adamson bill enacts a
flat basis of eight hours for the pur
pose of paying compensation, while
on the other hand it does not estab

idea once gets abroad in this country.
"I am for the merits of the case and
I am for proceeding according to the
rule of reason. I will go to the last
fact to find out what should be done.
and I will do it according to what I

WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. So many
conflicting elements have appeared
in the destruction of the British ship
Marina by a German mibmarlne, with
V, 1 AmoA.M llaa V. o if..
incident threatens to fall into a tech-
nical discussion rather than a clean
cut issue of whether Germany has
violated her pledges to the United
States. 1
Details Lacking
It became apparent today. both
from the attitude of the state depart
ment and from foreign dispatches,
that much which is essential to a de
termination of responsibility remains
undisclosed, if yindeed, the United
States, Germany or Great Britain is
in possession of the full facts.
Want German Version
It appeared certain no movement
would be made by tVtTr,,-'" te
until the German version of the affair
as well as that of the destruction of
the British ship Rowanmore by shell
fire with endangering of Americans,
has been obtained.
Bernstorff Asks Details
The only positive developments
' today were the action of Count
von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, in asking his govern
ment to forward full details by
wireless and the issuance of a
statement by Secretary Lansing
that the Investigation would be
in no wise delayed because there
is a political campaign in prog
ress. This was Mr. Lansing's ,
statement:
Case Will Be Rushed
"The fact that a political cam
paign is in progress will in no
way effect the practice of the de- "
partment in negotiating and in
making full investigation of cases
of this sort. We shall do it as we
always have with as much celeri
ty as possible. ,
U. S. To Stand Pat
"I wish also to make another
statement on a matter which lias
been brought to my attention.
The question has been raised as
to whether the policy . of the
President or the department in
regard to submarine : warfare
since the Sussex was sunk had
been changed. I wish to state
emphatically that there has been
no change in any particular."
Ship Reported Armed
While they await full details, two
outstanding fac's attracted the atten
tion of officials. One was the an
nouncement that the Marina ' was
armed with a 4-inch gun mounted a-
stern; the other was a news dispatch
from London, the language of which
was regarded as significant. It said:
"It is regarded here as quite prob
able that the American state depart-
I merit will make still further Inquiries
with the object of determining defi
nitely the status of the Marina. While
it was said that she was under pri
vate charter when she was torpedoed
it appears that the vessel ma have
been engaged in admiralty work not
long before."
This was generally construed to be
a reflection of some indication of
doubt in London over whether the
ship was entitled to the Immunities
of a peaceful merchantman.
The United States government,
however, never has altered its policy
of regarding merchant ships, tempor
arily in admiralty service, as mer
chantmen, still, unless they have been
actually taken over by a belligerent
nation and manned with a naval
crew.
Guns Again Issue
The question of the Marina's arma
ment, however, is likely to become
