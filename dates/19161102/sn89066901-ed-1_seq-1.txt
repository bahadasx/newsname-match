What might have been a disas-

by Leslie Strong, who had come
there from the Garner garage.

barn and called his father, Night
atch Roe Strong, and they i n
tered the ham, to which Leslie
had a key,. The office was full
nf amok, nnd tbev found a box
of papers on tire, probably orig
in iting from the factjjhat some
ono had thrown a cigar or cigar
ette stub "or a match into the
aoers. The fire was extinguish

headway to prove damaging, but
if it had not been discovered
