Judge Brewer represents the Univer

property in Oklahoma City. The Meth
odist Lpiscopal church, South, also Is
seeking possession of the property.
"I".iuity, good ctmsrienee and ordi

del standing ,,f all the parties be carried,
out and thr property relurned to the
land company," Judge Brewer said.

time, money and business and legal
ability lo make a success of the school
They were only defeated by malirious
opimsition of the churchmen who killed

shame to the cheek of Classen and
