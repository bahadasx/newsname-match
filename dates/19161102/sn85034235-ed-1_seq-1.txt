Ths Lure of Far Lands.
With a reasonable capital, youth,
strength, character and a knowledge
of the language fortunes can be made
relatively easier on the frontiers of
civilization than at home. There are,
however, many privations to be borne.
You nre away from friends. Mails at
best come once a week. News is
scarce. Daily papers exist only In
metropolitan towns, and the data they
lontain are meager. In many locali
ties fresh vegetables cannot be had
Drinking water is positively danger
ous. Fleas, bugs, mosquitoes and a
host of winged, singing, biting insects
are present to annoy during day and
night. Most hotels are bad and the
food strange, unpalatable and poorly
cooked.
For women but few real opportuni
ties exist. I know of but two women
lawyers in Latin America, and there
are iierhaps the same number of doc
tors and dentists. Relatively small
proportions of the fair sex follow com
mereial callings. In the far east and
Africa caste, the system of ""purdah"
and the general belief that woman is
inferior to man have retarded her
progress.—W. E. Aughinbaugta in Les
lie's.
Keep In the Sunshine.
There are only two kinds of people in
the world—the people* who live In the
shadow and gloom and those who live
on the sunny side of the street. These
shadowed ones are* sometimes called
pessimists, sometimes people of melan
choly temperament; sometimes they
are called disagreeable people. Rut.
wherever they go, their characteristic
is this—their shadows always travel on
before them. These people never bear
their own burden, but expose all their
wounds to others. They are all so
busy looking down for pitfalls and
sharp stones and thorns on which to
step that they do not even know that
there are any stars in the sky. These
folks live on the wrong side of the
street. And yet it is only twenty feet
across to the other sidewalk, where
sunshine always lies.—Newell Dwight
Hillls.
A Valuable Tooth.
There is nn amusing story of the
economy necessary in the early days
of the Norwegian theater at Bergen.
It was in 1849, when Ibsen and Bjorn
son were creating the national drama.
A lady had been engaged for the p^rt
of "second old woman" when it was
discovered that her elocutionary pow
ers were impaired by the fact that she
had lost one of her front teeth. Im
poverished as she was, the manage
ment came to the rescue and bore the
expense of the necessary dentistry.
When she retired, however, after two
seasons, she had to leave the tooth l>e
hlnd her. the example of the dentist's
art being the property of the theater.
The management was too poor to part
with it
She Was One of Them.
Once a high school principal was
having a dispute with one of his teach
ers. a vivneious young lady. She claim
ed that the word "man" meant man
kind as a whole, while "men" always
signified the masculine gender.
The principal maintained that therp
were exceptions and triumphantly
quoted, "Though 1 speak with the
tongues of men aud of angels.''
But the youpg lady answered de
nmrely. "That won't do. for, you see.
both genders are mentioned there."—

KENNY'S

Tragic Tale of the Rough Jus
tice of a Mining Camp.

The theory of Kenny's defense was
that Blick was first to draw. Clearly
no one believed it—not one of those
silent, rugged men who formed a semi
circle in front of Frisco's saloon.
Against Kenny's word was his reputa
tion—in the mining camp he was
known for a bad man, quick on the
draw and quicker on the trigger—and
there had been bad blood between the
dead man and him who now stood in
the center of the semicircle.
If in those days the laws of that out
of the way place, such as were defined,
were administered summarily with lit
tie dignity and less ceremony justice
was the quicker for it. Seldom was its
aim at fault, and it seldom if ever
hung fire.
Blick's stiffening form, lying face
downward on the hillside where it had
dropped when Kenny's gun had spat
had been exposed to the sun less than
an hour before Kenny was called upon
by the vigilance committee to explain,
lie and Blick had ridden into the hills
together. Kenny had returned home
alone.
They found Kenny down at Frisco's.
Boldly and with a show of unconcern
he began his version, while the men of
the V C. closed in and formed the sein i
c ircle around him.
Big and forbidding, Bill John Mickle
stood in the doorway, cutting off the
one avenue of retreat. Bill John had
presided as master of ceremonies on
more than one previous occasion of
this kind
"He tried to kill me," Kenny told
them. "I had to kill him."
But, looking from one rugged face
into another and reading their silent
verdict, the accused lost his self confi
dence. and in the desperation with
which a stag held at hay fights for
life "Kenny strove to convince the si
lent, unbelieving men of the truth of
his words.
There was no one to champion his
cause. The men of the V. O. did
things at first hand—every man to his
own defense. Determined to-maintain
at least a semblance of law and order,
they had found it necessary to take the
law into their own hands, sumetimes
to sacrifice human life to make human
life the more secure. They did It un
flinchingly.
Kenny had had his warning. A week
ago he had seen these men form a
semicircle and pass judgment on Sam
Carter, lie whose gun had harked
when some one here ut Frisco's pluck
ed a fifth ace from the gambler's
sleeve Before his man was cold Car
ter's legs were dangling three feet from
the ground and his body swayed from
a taut hemp rope.
So Kenny, remembering Sam Car
ter's fate and searching the grim faces
that walled him in for the encourage
ment he did not find, trembled
"He tried to kill me." lie repeated
slowly.
Silently one after anotbei slowiy
shook their heads. They knew Blick
for a man of,peace. And thdy knew

"I WAS BIDING ON Tltli UPi'EIl ÏKA1L
AND I SAW JT. UE KILLED UIM IN BELl
DEFENSE."
If It were not for the one thing,
thought Kenny, lie could make them
believe. That he and the man he had
killed had been hitter rivals until
Frisco's daughter Katie had given hei
heart to Blick completed his con dem
nation, and the silent, rugged men
would not believe.
Slowly, one after another, they shook
their heads.
"Say your prayers. Kenny."
Bill John Mickle from his stand in
the doorway pronounced judgment on
the culprit.
"And may God have mercy on your
soul!" he added. Somewhere hack in
civilization he had heard that
The condemned man did nut pray
Despairing, he saw the semicircle
broken where a man from whose arm
hup g a colled hemp rope stepped out
of his place and advanced quickly to
ward him.
Kenny's fingers Itched for the feel of
his gun. In another moment the uoose
was slipped over his head and drawn
so tight it pained him where the big.
rough knot pressed hard against his
neck.
"Say your prayers, Kenny," Bill John
repeated, "it's your last chance to say
them.''
Kenny looked dazedly about him.
lie was not looking for hope. Of
hope lie knew there was none. Fear,
to which he had been a stranger, chill
ed the blood in his veins. Still he did
not pray. To Bill John Mickle, who
still stood In the doorway looking
down upon the little tragedy enacted
in the little arena as a judge look3
down from the bench, the man with
the noose about his neck turned an
appealing, helpless, whitening face,
and his lips moved. But no sound es
caped them.
The silence was that of the hills and
of death.
It was broken by a footfall inside
the saloon, aud from behind Bill John
appeared a woman, little more than a
girl. She was Frisco's daughter Katie,
who, attracted by the crowd, had come
from the kitchen which was set apart
a little way iu the rear.
For one second she surveyed the
scene through eyes red with weeping;
theÿ she stepped into the semicircle of
men.
Kenny, t he rope about his neck, went
whiter at sight of her and trembled,
afraid of the woman for love of whom
he had gone to ids ruin.
But how he had loved her! If he
might know that she even now still
caral one little hit lie could go to his
doom and die like a man.
"Time's up," announced Bill John,
snapping the case of his watch.
"Wait."
Something in the girl's voice as she
spoke—something Kenny least of all
had expected and which he could not
define—caused him to lift his head.
Would she taunt him for killing her
lover, he who had known the way to
a woman's heart, now that lie was go
ing to his own death?
."He tried to kill me," he pleaded. "I
cannot make them believe me, but I
had to do it."
"That is what I have come to tell
you," answered the girl, addressing
the men who formed the semicircle
"I saw it all. I was riding on the up
per trail, and I saw it He killed him
in self defense."
Kenny looked at the girl unbellev
Ingly. She whose lover he had shot
down, whose scorn he had expected,
she had come at the crisis to save his
neck. They must believe her.
In spite of the hemp rope, he threw
back his head and laughed boldly iu
triumph, for he had cheated the death
that a moment before hovered over
him. and in life there would now be
no handsome, hated Blick to win away
the girl's heart from him.
Bill John Mickle from the doorway
was speaking.
"Kenny," he said, "she lias saved
your worthless hide, hut you've had a
nprrow escape. Let this be a lesson to
you. We can't bang you now, but this
community don't need your kind, and
you got to go. Before sundown— un
derstand?"
Unblushing and defiant, the girl who
bad drawn nearer to the man she had
saved, as though to further protect him
from the rest, turned upon Bill John.
"If he goes, then I go too." she threat
ened, knowing full well that every man
in camp was dependent upon her. the
only woman within forty miles.
Kenny, who was a man of action,
lost no time marveling at Katies un
expected words. He heard, and a
proud advantage over these rugged, si
lent men swelled within him. At the
Instant he regained all the bold defi
ance of his nature.
"Let us go," he said to her.
T am ready."
fhe men who had formed the semi
circle were silent and still no longer.
They gathered round Bill John and
Frisco and voiced their protest against
the girl's going. It was unanimous
"1 guess you can stay. Kenny."
Reversing his former decision with
these words. Bill John walked away,
and Katie, laughing in the pride of her
victory, ran back to her kitchen behind
Frisco's saloon. She felt certain that
Kenny would come to her there pres
ently.
Three hours later, when the men who
bad formed the semicircle were back
up hi the hills and Frisco dozed In n
corner of his saloon and the mining
camp was lifeless and still, the man
sought the woman who had saved bis
life.
For more than gn hour he had been
cursing himself for a blind fooi while
be lay outstretched upou the hunk in
his shgck at the foot of the bills
Any one else, he told himself, would
have known that the girl bad loved
lmn all the while and that, like a wo
man. she had only pretended Blick had
won her away from him.
But, even though she loved him and
had loved him while he had not known
it, Kenny felt that be owed her a
great debt for what she had done.
She had saved his life. He owed her
that at the very least.
He resolved then that he would de
vote it to her happiness and thought a
little of mending his ways. He would
make it all up to her.
At the kitchen he fouud her. She
was wiping the dishes when ho camp,
and, resting his elbows op the rough
window sill, he thrust his head and
shoulders inside
"Jintie. that was a, mighty big thing
you done for me today." he said slm
fly
The girl dried her hands and came
tad stood beside the window.
"You saved my life, girl." the man
went on "Why Old you tell 'em yon
saw me—saw It all?"
Bui still the girl answered nothing
■'li as it because you love me. Katie?'
Af»or a little hesitating moment the
girl looked up, straight into Kenny'i
hungry eyes, and slowly shook her
head.
"No." she said—"no, 1 don't love you.
Kenny. It wasn't that."
The man started, surprised.
"Then, why did you tell 'em that
lie?" he lemauded of her. "Why
didn't you let 'em finish the job?"
"Because," the girl answered him
"because I need you, Kenny; because
want you to help me. Do you love me.
Kenny?"
"God. how many times have I told
you?" he cried passionately. "I'd give

"That's what I'm going to jftk of
you. Kenny," site said. "It's your
name I want—just that"
"My name?" be asked, understand
ing nothing of what she was trying to
tell him. "My name? For what?"
"For the child whose father you kill
ed today." she answered bravely, a lit
tie quiver in her voice, and hung her
head to hide what might be in her face
and iu her eyes. "Do you understand
now ?"
Kenny staggered backward as oue
under the weight of a heavy blow and
stared for a moment, unbelieving
Then he snjd:
"Yes; I understand now."
"We were to lie married next Sun
day when the parson comes," she add
ed, but Kenny gave no sign that be
heard. lie had turned his back to the
window and was looking far away
across the hills.
"You will do this for me—what i
ask?" She pressecVlTlni for au answer.
"I have been honest with «you, Kenny.
You must remember that. I need not
have told you. and I saved your life
today."
"You saved my life, yes." he cried,
turning quickly upon her, "but you
loved him!"
"Yon will do it, Kenny?" she insist
ed as he was turning away.
"Tomorrow I will tell you. I don't
know." he answered, and without an
other word he walked away and went
to his shack.
Before sundown a man on a horse,
with his blankets rolled into a pack
behind his saddle and his outfit strap
ped to his back, rode out of camp and
up Into the hills.
It was Kenny, and he was going
away
Down in the little kitchen behind
Frisco's saloon in the valley a woman,
little more than a girl, was' weeping
bitter tears.
In the Family.
Uncle Henry married my father's
cousin. They lived alone in a great
bouse, which had the most dismal li
brary in the whole wide world. It was
all black walnut, lined with books
with dull leather backs and uninter
esting titles. Over the shelves, against
a border of black velvet, were rows of
marble statuettes that came from Eu
rope.
There were two invalid chairs with
big wheels, although neither Uncle
Henry nor Aunt Ella were really in
valids. and in one corner of the room
was a Swiss music box that played
lugubrious airs. Finally Uncle Henry
died, and then Aunt Ella, and all the
property had to be divided.
Aunt Ella had always worn a large
black cameo likeness of Uncle Henry,
which had been cut in Rome. It was
set as a brooch and was surrounded
with rather large sized diamonds and
was an object of most sacred venera
tlou to us all. We felt that it should
go—as the greatest treasure of all—to
the niece with Uncle Henry's name.

M'S PRESENT
A Gift and Message That Tickled
Lincoln's Sense of Humor.
RETURNING THE COMPLIMENT.
An Equivalent That Was Appreciated
and Treasured by the Confederate
Colonel — An Episode Born of the
Capture of General Stoughton.
Colonel Johu S. Mosby, the southern
cavalry leader in the war betweeu the
states, accumulated many mementos
of that long aud bloody struggle, but
uoue which lie treasured more jealous
ly than a lock of dark hair wrapped in a
faded yellow scrap of newspaper. The
hair was cut from the head of Abra
ham Lincoln. It was Lincoln's own
hand which cut it, and the great war
president himself who sent it
Iu the spring of 1803 the Army of the
Potomac lay along the north hank of
the Rappahannock, about fifty miles
south of Washington. The intervening
country was, of course, iu the posses
sion of the Union troops. Off in the
recesses of the Blue Ridge mountains,
about thirty miles westward, was
Colonel Mosby, with a body of picked
southern cavalrymen, seeking to do
what injury he could to the Federal
outposts and lines of communication.
About the middle of March there en
camped at Fairfax Court House, a vil
lage of about 500 inhabitants, halfway
between Washington and the army on
the Rappahannock, a force cf several
thousand Union troops under General
Stoughton.
From a military point of view, his
camp at Fairfax was nearly as safe as
Boston. Between his own force and
the southern army, under General Lee,
lay General Hooker's great Army of
the Potomac. Even Colonel Mosby's
small force—less than a hundred men
—was thirty miles away.
Nevertheless, Colonel Mosby deter
mined to capture General Stoughton.
Selecting twenty of his best troopers
he started oue drizzly March afternoon
for Stoughton's camp. It was after
midnight when he ran into the first
picket, who was easily captured in the
darkness. And thus, taking picket aft
er picket in the black night. Colonel
Mosby made his way without alarm
into the village, until he entered Gen
oral Stoughton's bedchamber.
The unhappy officer was compelled
to dress and accompany his captors.
The pitch black, rainy night and the
fact that the men of both commands
wore rubber capes of the same style
rendered it Impossible for the prison
ers, Stoughton included, to determine
the number of the enemy. With half
a hundred prisoners and a hundred
horses. Colonel Mosby quietly made his
way out of the camp and was soon be

The adventure created a stir in mili
tary quarters. Stoughton was roundly
censured for allowing himself thus to
be stolen from the midst of his troops,
although he was in nowise to blame.
President Lincoln, whose sense of
humor nothing could quench, remark
ed, when told of the affair, that he did
not mind losing the general, but the
hundred horses were a serious matter.
"I can make a general with the
scratch of a pen," he said dryly, "but
I can't make horses."
Shortly afterward Colonel Mosby,
with a few companions, was recon
noitering in the vicinity of Washing
ton. On the road he encountered an
old Dutch market woman taking her
gnrdeu truck in her cart to peddle It
through the Washington streets. Colo
nel Mosby stopped and questioned her.
Noticing a pair of scissors at her belt
and having heard of President Lin
coln's comments on General Stough
ton's capture, he said:
"Do you know Mf. Lincoln?"
"Yah," replied the old woman. "Seen
him often, I have."
Taking the scissors. Colonel Mosby
cut off a lock of his hair, and wrap
ping it in n piece of paper handed it
to the old woman, saying:
"I'm Colonel Mosby. Wheu you get
to Washington go to the White House
and tell the president that Colonel
Mosby sent him this lock of his hnir
and say also that he is coming over
into Washington some night to get a
lock of the president's hair."
The old market woman went her
way, and Colonel Mosby rode back
and forgot the incident. Some weeks
later, however, when making another
reconnoissanee in that neighborhood,
the old woman hailed him from a road
side cottage. Hurrying into the cot
tage, she brought forth a scrap of
newspaper and delivered it to Colonel
Mosby.
"Here iss a lock of President
Lincoln's hair," she said. "He tolt me
to say to you that he hat rather you
vould not come ofer to see him and
that he send it to you by me. Here It
iss!"—Youth's Companion.
As She Saw It.

WARSHIP FIGHTING TOPS.
They Are Now Mainly Used For Sentry
and Signaling Work.
Lord Nelson was killed by a musket
ball fired from the crosstrees of hi*
French antagonist Because of this
fighting tops came into existence and,
being developed to keep pace with
other parts of naval construction, coo.
tinue to be a traditional feature of tbs
world's navies.
A - century ago. when fighting men-«
mnrines, boarding parties, gun crews—
crowded the upper decks of a warship,
a sharpshooter posted aloft picked off
many a man. But a big battleship In
action today shows not a mark to tb*
man in the fighting top.
In the days when it still remained
possible for boatloads of armed men
to swarm up the sides and board A
fighting ship plunging shots were drop
ped from the fighting top. But with
great steel walls overhanging th«
waves and never an accommodation
ladder swung out for their welcome It
Is impossible for uninvited guests to
set foot oil the modern deck.
The captain of the fighting top lo
usually in control of (lag, semaphore
and heliograph signaling, leaving the
wireless to an invisible operator in
terned somewhere in the ship's vital*.
He is the sentry against small Inquisi
tive craft and may enforce his order*
by the rattle of a light quick tirer.
He has the outlook, reports and ques
tions passing ships und has virtues a*
a detective against spies. His func
tions, however, are limited. He is not
high enough placed to see the subma
rine creeping along a score' of feet be
neath the surface or to note its w*k*
of broken water.
The fighting top is in big cruiser*
quite a massive affair and no longer
the tiny breastwork behind which th*
picked riflemen of the ancients knelt.
A duplicate set of range finders is usu
ally kept there and used to check off
the work of the experts in the fire con
trol tower. There are light quick firer*
and machine guns, possibly also a high
angle gun or two for use against tkr
craft.—Pearson's.
Original Home of Welshmen.
Jutland was probably the original
homo of our Kymric ancestors, as well
as (at a later period) of some so called
Saxon Invaders. It was peopled In
classical times by the Cimbrl, identi
fied by ethnologists with the Cymry.
or modern Welshmen. The Germans
magnanimously declined to annex Jut
land with Schleswig-Holstein. It was
(hen considered a worthless waste of
moors, sand dunes and marshes. But
tho Industrious Dajics have transform
ed what one English traveler styled '*»
forsaken wilderness" into the most
prosperous pastoral countries of west
ern Europe.—Westminster Gazette.
Bee's Double Stomach.
The bee has two distinct stomach*.
In the first it stores away the honey It
so Industriously gathers up from the
flowers until such time as it is ready
to yield it up, while the other stomach
is used simply and solely for digestion
purposes. Thus the food and the honey
nre never mixed. When the bee re
turns to the hive and is ready to de
posit the honey it has gathered It con
tracts tho muscles of the stomach, by
which act the honey is ejected through
the mouth. As to bee food, it is vari
ous in kind, consisting largely of the
honey it so patiently makes for othar*.
No "Poor Land."
"That land of yours was mighty poor
when you bought It," a friend of our*
remarked to tho wide awake owner of
a beautiful farm wo passed tho other
day, whereupon the owner delivered
himself of n faithful saying and wor
thy of all acceptation—or mighty near
ly so. "You're mistaken," he said.
"There's not any poor land when yon
manage it right." It Is a true rule that
"there is more In the man than there Ut
in the land."—Progressive Farmer.
Superstitions of Royalty.
