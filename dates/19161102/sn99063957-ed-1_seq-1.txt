noimced today.
I "The artillery engagement on the
east bank of the Meuse repeatedly in

pecially heavy destructive fire against
Fort Vaux, which had already been
ovacuatejl during the night by our
troops, following a given order and
without being disturbed by the enemy.
Important parts of the fort were blast
ed by us before withdrawal."

Weatherford and Lane Ad
dress Big Audience at
Grand Last Night
Senator Harry Lane, a former Sn
lemitc and once superintendent of the
Oregon state asylum, and Mark Weath
erford, democratic candidate for rep
resentative in congress from the First
district against W. C. llnwley, repub
lican, discussed the issues of the pres
ent campaign Inst nightat the Grand
opera house before an audience that
filled the theater to capacity. Dr. W.
H. Kvrd was chnirman of the evening
and introduced the speakers. s.
- Dr. xiyrri, in a snort introductory
speech, said be expected tho country to
return Woodrow Wilson to tho White
House next. Tursday. He believed if
they did that they should elect men
to congress who would work in har
mony with the administration policies
and he introducedMark Weatherford,
the candidate for whom he said they
ought to vote.
Mr. Weatherford started out by say
ing that he oiwsed the brewers amend
ment as it provides that, brewers can
sell beer or Honor to any person, and
as the law defines a person to be ninu,
woman, or child, he declared, they could
manufacture beer and sell it to the
children at the doors of the public
schools. lie aaid ho opposed any meas
ure that debauches the public schools
of Oregon -and did not .aee.liow the
people could afford, to let sucn a meas
ure pass, lie aaid he would fight all
measures that debauched the citizens
of the country; he declared he stood
for a sober citizenship. More, valuable
than a big navy, a great army, than
stacks of ammunition piled high, is a
sober citizen, in bis opinion. He ite
clared ho was thankful tho country had
a sober president in the White House
wnen war threatened.
Among tho many questions brought
up tor consideration during tae pres
ent campaign he cited the federal re
serve act and the rural credits act,
both designed to help the fanners; the
shipping bill, designed to aid in build
ing up a merchant marine; the eight-
hjetir law. which he said needs no de
lense or apology and is right and just;
and tae Mexican- policy.
In regards to the Mexican policy he
said that at one time Taft. called on
the' secretary of war for an estimate-
as to what it would cost in time, men
and money to go into Mexico. The sec
retary of wnr replied to President Taft
that it would take two years, 500,000
men, and cost a million dollars a day
This problem Mr. Weatherford says
President Taft turned over-to Wilson,
Ho admitted the navy went to Vera
Cruz, admitted the army was mobilized
on the border, admitted the president
went to the extreme limit wituout act
ually going to war; He did not want
to go down to Mexico to fight for the
Standard Oil and tnought our eoun
try had higher purposes.

He asked the suffrage of the people
for Mr. Weatberlord and, without re
flectinu whatever on Mr. Hawley a
record, said he believed Mr. Weather
ford could represent tne district oei
tor and be more in harmony with ad
ministrative policies.
He declared the prosiienty was goou
all the wav across the continent, at
Baltimore, Chicago, Minneapolis, Port
land. He said the business men assured
him business was never better. He dis
cussed the tariff situation and said
the administration tried 'to pass meas
ures that helped humanity directly. If
republicans got up a good measure he
says he voted for it; he said he would
vote for a good bill, brought red hot
out of Hades by his Satanic Majesty
himself and would grab it when it got
cool enough to handle.
He explnined tho eight hour law and
brought its application close home to
humanity; Jie spoke of the child labor
law, and said President Wilson was
tho only president since Lincoln to
come to the senate and plead for a law
when he urged the passage or the child
labor legislation. Regarding Mexico he
said be would like to send an army into
the country loaded with beefsteak and

New York, Nov. 2. President
Wilson, arrived today for his
campaign drive in New York
City, was greeted with a roar of
enthusiasm such as promised to
make his Madison Square Gar
den appearance tonight a rival
of the political meeting in the
Garden four years ago when he
was cheered for more than an
hour.

and the throng took it up and

Cabs, shook hands and shouted
"We're with you, Mr. Presi-

By Eobert J. Bender.
( United Press staff correspondent.)
New York, Tkty'. 2. In apirited at
tack on "the" opposition of Big Busi
ness to progress," President Wilson this
afternoon' told the Business . Men 's
League luncheon that "the leading
biisiness man of the country and their
nation is based upon the human heart
Business cannot afford to let anything
alone. When I hear a man say: 'Let
business alone.' I know he doesn't know
business. t-
- "You have got to have new blood.'
' The president said there were a small
number of men in Wall Btreet who feel
that "nothing ii safe unless they are
considered." ,
"Aristocracy,' he said, "is just as
bii foi business as it is for a govern
ment. That is why I was so interested
in the federal reserve set. It has brok-
eu.up the business of limiting control.'
'In making "this fight" the president
declared "Lam fighting a battle for
the very men who opposed, for if it Is
not won, tne very business in which
they ai.e interested will crumble-"
"i.iiual opportunities for all men
should be the code of business as well as
other things.
"The leading business men and their
legal counsel have always opposed pro

" We arc living in a very serious per

" llicref .ire, we must search every

he termed I ho "common masses."
"The ctly sources of strength 'for
business as oell as government are to
be found in the people," he continued,
holding that tley must be satisfied and
confident of justice if they are to do
their work happily and well.
"The ioois of our daily life are these
people who tiavel the streets," he add
ed. "And these people have the im
pression that they are being exploded
that others iray prosper while they are

He soid nearly every progressive idea
which has borne fruit "has had some

" Politics, " he said, "rests on the hu
man soul." Progressiveism "is a con
stant adjustment of the condition of bo
cietv t thu welfare of mankind."
"Tne law of adjustment is the law of

SMALL HITCH ARISES
OVER UNLOADING CARGO
Captain Koenig Says Under
sea Boats Will Displace
Battleships
New London, Conn., Nov. 2. Smiling
Captain Koenig, skipper of the green
German submarine freighter Deutsch-
land, confidently thought today he
will be able to unload his $10,000,000
cargo without interference from the
United States.
He claimed there was no hitch about
this, but Collector of Port McGovern,
of Connecticut, evidently thought diff
erent, for he hastened to Hartford yes
terday to confer with Secretary of the
Treasury McAdoo, presumably about
the known jewels and the stocks and
bonds said to be aboard. The outcome
of this session had not been made pub
lic eariy today.
Soporific New London is wider awake
now that it has been since the days
when the British sneaked up the chan
nel, captured the fort atop the Gordon
mils and slew the brave American com
mandor.
Captain Jioenig and his crew are
cheered every time they appear on the
street. A lu-year-old member of the
crew with several sturdy 'fellow mem
bers narrowly escaped embraces from a
crowd or liandsonie women when they
appeared on Main street today. "They
only edged out after they'd signed au
tograph photographs of their boat. TLo
orow has shore leave and they're en
joying it. . ...
'Jbe story goes that when the Scot!
tug greeted the Deutschlaad and in
quired if it wanted a tow, a voice from
aboard the submarine answered, '.'No,
we want beer."
Captain Koenig ' talk with newspa
permen, left the impression that anti-
American feeling still is rather strong
in Germany, though he hesitantly sail!
it was not "very bad.V.. He scoffs at
the British blockade- .
'It's only a spy system, a chain of
commercial agents," he said, "end if
the British navy comes out, why we'll
be ready for them, though, frankly, we
can't catch up to England's naval
strength during the war.
"Germany thinks the war will last at
least another year and it is confident of
tne outcome.
"The submarine is the vessel of the
future. Battleships are no good any
more and anybody who doesn 't Bee that
must wear blinders. I think the United
States is beginning to realize it."

Dallas, Texas, Nov. 2. The Texas

Good crops, high prices and diversi
fied farming have made him tho most
independent figure in the entire citi
zenry of the state. He's paid debts of
years' standing, has money in the bank,
ownB a new $15 hat and can spend the
rest of the winter testing his new fliv
ver and the country speed laws.
Cotton, of course, is the principal
"money" crop. The farmer is getting
an average of 18 cents a pound now.
A 000 pound bale yields him 500 pound
of lint and l.r00 pounds of seed which,
with the cotton, totals abont $127.50.
Texas cotton is averaging good per
acre.
Baseball fans will be cheered by the
information that Texas has about 200,
000 acres of peanuts this year. But
dealers will make their five cent sacks
considerably smaller next spring if they
hope to glean any profit after tho far
mer gets through raising the price.
There is also an enormous crop of pe
cans, which are bringing la cents a
pound.
Isorghum first aid to buckwheat
pancakes is showing a profit of about
$200 an acre. Bice growers have the
biggest crop in historyi and are getting

' Alfalta, corn, wheat and oats have

IF MARINA ARMED:
10LE QUESTION
WILL BE UP AGAIN
Whether Merchantmen Can
. Arm for Defense Not
Agreed Upon .
GERMANY HAS NEVER
ADMITTED THIS RIGHT
Question Discussed But Al
lowed to Lapse In Former
Dispute
Washington, Nov. 2. Reopening of
the entire armed merchantman contro
versy between this government an$
Germany is certain, if it is proved th
British steamer Marina was armed at
the time she was sunk by a German sub
marine, statements of Secretary Lans
ing indicated today. '
Whether merchantmen have a right to
arm for defense still is an open quts-
tion between this government and Ger
many, Lansing admitted. This que-.
tion will be the principal one if nego
tiations develop with Germany over tha
death of six Americans on board the
Marina, it was stated. ' 1 .
While this government hat-maintain
ed the right of merchantmen to arm for
defense, Germany has never admitted it.
The question first arose when the Lusi
tania was sunk. This government has in
sisted that merchantmen may arm with
any guns not over six inches in caliber.
When discussion of this point arose dur
ing tho Lusitania negotiations the state
department showed the Lusitania was
unarmed. Without a recession by this
government from its position- or aa ad
mission by Germany that merchantmen
might arm, the question was pcrsaittfd
to lapse. '. '-
Secretary Lansing said the right of
merchantmen to arm still is a mooted
question; that there has been no decision
over it. Germany is expeeted to Main
tain that armed merchantmen were not
included in her pledges to the United
States.
' Followed Ship's Boats.
' London, Nov. 2. The submarine that
sank the British steamer Marina with
the probable loss of six Ameriean Uvea
followed the ship's boats for half an
hour after the Marina went down but
offered no assistance, American surviv
ors reported..
A. Devlin, of Norf ork, and P. S. Ham
lin, of Baltimore, among tho Americana
landed at Dublin, told practically the
same story. The -submarine was sub
merged when she fired the first tor
pedo, they said, but came to the surface
and, after seeing that the stoamer re
mained afloat, shot another torpedo into
the port side.
