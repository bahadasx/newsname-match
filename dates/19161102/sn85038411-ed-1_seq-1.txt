FORT VAUX IS
• EVACUATED BY
CROWN PRINCE
Berlin Concedes Withdrawal
From Important Fortifi
cation
RUMANIANS HOLD FIRM
Von Mackensen Believed to Be
Preparing New Thrust;
Russ Defeated
Fort Vaux, one of the most impor
tant fortifications captured by the Ger
man crown prince in his prolonged
drive at Verdun, has been evacuated
by the Germans. The evacuation is
announced by Berlin to-day.
Shortly after Fort Douaumont had
been retaken and a wide stretch of the
front in this region regained by the
French in their sudden offensive on
October 2 5 it was pointed out that
Fort Vaux likewise had been put in a
perilous position. The French ad
vanced close to the edge of the forti
fication on its immediate front in their
great drive and pushed well beyond it
on each side, making its fall. In the
opinion of observers at the front, only
c. question of a short time.
The Germans evacuated Fort Vaux
during the night, says their official
report, without hindrance by the
French, and after portions of the fort
had been blown up. The French con
tinued to pour a heavy Are from their
oig guns on the fortification.
Lost All Their Gains
Virtually all the ground of pro
nounced value taken by the Germans
on the eastern bank of the Meuse in
their winter and spring offensive at
\erdun has now with the fall of Fort
> aux been lost to them.
French troops operating In the
Les Rouefs and Ranoourt sectors on
the Sommo front also gained ground
yesterday in attacks on the German
lines. The Paris report of night
announcing these advances is in part
confirmed by the Berlin official state
ment to-day. which concedes French
tains northeast of Morval and on the
edge of the St. Pierre-Vaast wood, but
declares that the n-.ain effort of the
French to move forward was sangui
narily repulsed.
The British likewise, says Berlin,
failed in an attack north of Courcelette
on the Somrne front. London last
night reported gains in the Les Bouefs
sector in operations in conjunction
■with the French, but announced to-
Gay that heavy rain was falling and
that there were no noteworthy hap
penings during the night.
Rumanians Hold Firm
M There is no apparent let-up in the
m pressure which General von Falk"n
havn is exerting along the Rumanian
northwestern frontier, but in general
the Rumanians are reported to be
holding him fairly well in check. No
new advances of importance are an
nounced to-day by the German war
office.
In the meantime, however, military
critics are looking shortly for definite
news from the province of Dobrudia.
on the southeast front, where "no
change in the situation" has been the
v.stial report from both sides for sev.
ral days past. Field Marshal von
Mackensen is believed to be making
preparations for a new stroke in an
effort to complete his conquest of this
Rumanian province. while from
Bucharest comes unofficial announce
ment that General Sakharoff, one of
the ablest of the Russian generals. Is
expected in the Rumanian capital to
take command of the forces in
Dobrudja.

Excuse Removed, U.S. Should
Get Out of Drink Business
Altoona, Pa., Nov. 2. —Liquidation
of ihe Civil War debt, the only excuse
ever given for the Federal government
Issuing liquor licenses, long since has
been accomplished, and now the
United States should get out of the
drink business. Ira Landrith, the Pro
hibition vice-presidential nominee, told
a crowd here to-day.
, ,"T 01 ' Northerners passed this liquor
bill, he said. "You did it in 1562.
Me Southerners weren't in Congress
then. We can prove an alibi. You
jou wanted to m66t the war
debt, and you probablv did. And
President Lincoln agreed to the bill's
passage only with the understanding
that it would be repealed when the
war was over. The war now has been
over more than fifty years. The debts
R re paid. "We don't need the rnonev
any longer."

HIGH COST OF LIVING
G. O. P. Nominee Attacks Ad
ministration For Extravagance
and Failure of Promises
Batavia, X. Y.. Nov. 2. Charles
E. Hughes declared to-day before an
audience here that he Is entirely con
fident of the result in both Ohio and
■ Indiana.
"I have returned from a trip
through Ohio and Indiana." he said,
i "with :x profound sense of gratifica
i tion and entire confidence with respect
to the result in both States. In both
Ohio and Indiana it is not exaggerat
| ingto say that I had receptions which
jperhaps exceeded those accorded to
! any other presidential candidate.
I "That was, of course, as I said last
night, not attributed to me personally
i but it was an indication of the deep
interest the people are taking in the
essential conditions of their prosperity
and their satisfaction that there is a
great reunited Republican party ready
for service at this critical time.
"So far as promises go no one can
I exceed the promises of our prospects
but we measure what they say by what
they have done."
Mr. Hughes assailed the Democratic
party for failure to reduce the high
cost of living, "as promised four years
ago." and for extravagance.
"They tell us now," he continued,
"that they are going to deal with
economic problems that confront us
at this time, in a satisfactory manner,
but if we endeavor to ascertain by
what principle they are to be guided
we look in vain."

~
DISCRETIONARY QUESTION
President Judge Kunkel Re
fuses Northampton's Suit
to Compel Action
Pennsylvania is required to repair
and maintain the highways Incorpor
ated In the State system by authority
of the acts of 1911 and 1913, only j
when the Commonwealth formally!
takes over this work and assumes the!
responsibility for the care and main
tenance, and not necessarily at the
time they become integral parts of
the State highway system.
In a comprehensive opinion handed
down to-day President Judge Kunkel
so decided in refusing the request of
the Northampton county commission
ers for a mandamus upon the State
Highway Department, to compel the
State to construct and maintain the
road leading from Nazareth to Bethle-'
hem via Newburg and Hecktown.
"As the State Highway Department
has not assumed the maintenance of
the road in question," savs President
Judge Kunkel, "it follows that the
Highway Commissioner is not respon
sible for its care or tne Commonwealth
liable for the expense of maintenance. ]
When it has been taken over and its
care and maintenance assumed by the
Highway Department will Northamp
ton county be relieved of the expense
thereof.
