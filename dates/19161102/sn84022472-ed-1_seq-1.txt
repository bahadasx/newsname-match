Letters Just Issued Strange
ly Resemble Those of Two
Years Ago When Hill's
Spokesman Assured Gen
erous Donor of His Desire
to 'Reciprocate" at
Washington.
' i ,; '.. "
Desperate because the dead
ly exposures of E. J. Hill's cam
paign methods have almost in
escapably sealed his political
doom the National , Republican
Congressional committee has
sounded a call for help to man
iufa'ctutrers throughout the
Fourth Congressional district.
The letter clearly indicates
that the erstwhile confident Re
publicans now are extremely
dubious as to the outcome in
the Fourth. It will be "impos
sible to lose" if there is enough
s funds for the use, of the cam
: paigners in each "close dis
! trict" according to the appeal.
The letter is suspiciously' like cer-
tain other letters which' have figured
i in Mr. Hill's former campaigns, in that
it speaks of the necessity, of 'certain
work' to b done. Mr. Htlr political
v adviser and the chairman of his fund-
- raising committee fit the -last: election,
was Arthur C. Wheeler. vy;Ii was
Wheeler who wrote the letters which
he probably thpught never' -vould see
publicity in .which he expressed Mr.
Hill's desire to .'-reciprocate in Wash
ington for funds that such organiza
, tions as the Straw Brid association
' had given to. his campaign.
R, W. Austin, chairman of the

the signer of , the appeal.
Here Is the letter: ;
My Dear Mr. : '
We are again appealing to a .
few prominent business men - to

raise funds sufficient to allow it,
we will complete an organization

We know how business men'

really embarrassing to the mem

we are giving. -our entire time to

Secretary of the Treasury Challenges Criticism From
Opponents of President Wilson on His Epochal Re
forms in Nation's Finances Riddles Fallacious Argu
ments Against President's Foreign Policy.
i
Hartford, Nov. 2 Speaking before a throng of thousands
of enthusiastic electors here last night, William G. McAdoo,
secretary of the treasury of the United States, advanced irre
futable arguments in behalf of the retention of the Wilson
administration, and incidentally riddled the specious campaign
against President Wiloli as , waged by the "100 per cent, can
didate" and the "vocal part" of the Republican party.
Mr. McAdoo's speech was a dignified, logical, convincing
resume of legislation accomplished during the Wilson ad
ministration, particularly that part of the progressive legisla
tion that has to do with the nation's finances. But in passing
he took up certain phases of the opposition to President Wil
son, especially as to his conduct of foreign affairs, and meet
ing argument with argument, he exposed the fallacies of
Hughes and Roosevelt with 'telling effect.
The reception extended to Mr. Mc- l
A'cDoo was little, short of remarkable.
He was cheered to the echo, the meet
ing (being marked with an enthusiasm
rarely witnessed in a political gather
ing in this state. Mr. McAdoo's speech,
is given in full, herewith: .
The American people are now en
joying honorable peace and phenom
enal prosperity under President Wil
son.' The Republican leaders are ask

on which they, are asked to make the

RECALLING DONOVAN'S ACTIVITIES
IN THEIR BEHALF, TROLLEYFIN OF
NORWALK COMMEND HIS CANDIDACY
Congressional Candidate's Work in General Assembly for
Safety and Health of Employes and Travelling Public
, Is Eecalled By Street Railway Employes' Local.
Re-oaying the tireless legislative ac
tivities of Jeremiah Donovan, of Nor
walk, Democratic candidate for Con
gress in the Fourth district, for the
betterment of working conditions and
for the safety of the traveling public,
Norwalk Local No. 476 of the Interna
tional Association of Street Railway
Employes, has warmly commenkied his
candidacy. "
In an eloquent reminder of the then
Senator's strong fight in the interests
of closed vestibules, the union's local
has issued an open letter in the inter
ests of Mr. Donovan's candidacy.
The letter follows:
Norwalk, Connecticut,
October 25, 1W6.
Whereas, we, , the members of Lo
cal No. 476, of the International
Association of Street Railway Em-
ployes, are not forgetful of the
kindly acts of our frien'dis, we re-
v spectf ully call the attention of our
members throughout Fairfield coun
ty,v Connecticut, and the attention
- of all the people' who patronize '
street railway cars to the efforts of
Hon. Jeremiah Donovan of Nor
walk, Connecticut, in. our behalf
which resulted in vestibules being
ordered placed on all. street cars
for the protection of . operatives and.
the public.
Whereas, Jeremiah Donovan as a
member of the Senate of Connect!-'
cut advocated and introduced bills
in 1903, 1905 and 1907 for our wel
fare, comfort and health as well as
. the comfort of the general public,
we ?esire at this time to ask our
members and the general public to
think back to the time when there
were no windshields or vestibules
on street cars; to picture the mo- -tormen
and conductors facing sleet,
wind and hail in zero weather; and
to remember the icy platforms and .
cold cars resulting from the lack
of vestibule3.
Whereas, the efforts of Mr. Don
eign relations if they are put in pow-
er. under tne pressure or insistent

that had either been president at the

would -have taken a course which in
evitably would have brought' on war
between the United States and Ger
many. . . . N .'. ,

Creek on October 1st, discussing the

PRESIDENT HAS
BUSY DAY WITH
FOUR SPEEGHE!
Arrives in New York Early
For Wind-Up " of His
Campaign.
RAILROAD EMPLOYES
GIVE HIM WELCOME
Thousands to Parade Before
Big Garden Meeting
Tonight.
New York, Nov. 2. President Wil
son arrived here this morning from
his campaign trip up state. He was
taken by automobile across town to
the Hudson river and went aboard
the government yacht Mayflower.
When the President reached the
Grand Central, station, to spend his
only day of campaigning in New York
city, with" four speeches on his pro
gram for the afternoon and evening,
he was cheered by a large group of
railroad men, some of them carrying
American flags.
(He was met at the station by Col.
Edward; M. House and Vance C. Mc
Cormick, chairman of the Democratic
National committee. With him they
motored to the New York Yacht club's
pier and boarded the Mayflower for a
political conference. Mr. Wilson
was accompanied here by Mrs. Wilson,
Miss Margaret Wilson, his daughter;
Miss Helen Woodrow Bones, his cous
in; John R. Wilson of Baltimore, his
brother; Secretary Tumulty and Dr.
C. T. Grayson, the White House phy
sician. While the President, Mr. House
and Mr. McCormick, were on the
Mayflower, . Mrs. Wilson and the other
women in the party went for a short
chopping tour.
The President found it would be
impossible for him to carry out the
program set for him and decided not
to attend the 69th regiment bazaar
in the afternoon. Mrs. Wilson, how-
. ever, arranged to visit it and a com
mittee of women from the bazaar
planned to meet her at a hotel after
her husband had addressed the lun
cheon of the Wilson Businessmen's
League.
The President, instead of going to
the bazaar, it was announced, would
visit Democratic National Headquar
ters here to meet the staff working
for ,'hls re-election, later returning , to
the Mayflower to work on his night
speech. . ' "
The President's principal address
will be at Madison Square Garden to
night. Following the address at the
Garden, the President will speak at
Cooper Union, and possibly, address an
overflow meeting in Cooper Square.
In connection" with thtf Madison
Square Garden rally, Democratic or
ganizations have arranged for several
great parades, a feature of which will
be the appearance of a large number
of boys not .yet of voting age accom
panying , each . district organization.
The parades will be under the direc
tion of the Wilson and Marshall clubs
which announce that more than 25,
000 men will be in line.
The luncheon of the Wilson Busi
nessmen's League is' of a national
character with representative from
many states. There will also be dele
gations of. businessmen from various
sections of the country. It is announc
ed that the President, in his speech,
will deal with the policies of his ad
ministration, having a direct bearing
upon the business interests of the
country. ,
William Church Osborn will pre
side at the meting at Madison Square
Garden. iThe only other speaker will
be'' Martin H. Glynn, former governor
of New York.
Officials in the President's party
said no announcement was ready in
connection with the sinking of the
steamship Marina with the resultant
loss of American lives.

Their Injuries.
As a result of injuries suffered in
accidents, Patrick Barrett. 60 years of
age. of 611 Arctic street and Jere-
nJiah Barry, of 2,858 Fairfield avenue,
both died at St. Vincent's hospital
yesterday.

cycle on which he was riding with
Guner Nyberk. Both suffered frac
tured skulls. Nyberk died Monday
afternoon of his injuries.

of demonstrators. Three dollars per
day is the rate paid the demonstra
tors. This year the Republicans have
the top lever, . Democrats second
place; Socialists next, Prohibition
party candidates next and Socialist
Labor party last. No demonstrator
could be procured for the machine in
the city hall corridor and Mayor Wil

POLICEMEN NOW
COMPETING WITH
SKILLED LABOR
Work as Painters, Carpen
ters and Bricklayers for
Cut Bates.
LEAVE CITY STBEETS
WITHOUT PROTECTION
Commissioners Trying To
Emulate Iniquitous Pris
on Labor System.
Temporarily removing from their
routes policemen who were formerly
skilled mechanics, members of the
Carpenters', Bricklayers and PaJint
ers' unions, the officials of the police
department have set the men to woi-k
building a garage in back of police
headquarters and painting the inter
ior of the police building.
These men, all of whom formerly
earned from $4 to $6 a day at their
trades, axe most all new members of
the force and 'receive only $2.75 a
day as patrolmen. The action of the
heads of the police department has
caused a. storm of protest in union
labor circles and resolutions con
demning the police commissioners and
demanding that regular tmion labor
be hired probably will be passed at
the next meeting of the Central La
bor Union, where the matter will bje
taken up. ! A
v This practice will result in dissatis
faction and the demoralization of the
police force in the opinion of many
members of the force if it does not
ceaso.
For the last several weeks police
men have been busy painting the new
headquarters of Superintendent Red
gale and they are now engaged in
another part of the building, two re
serve men,. Jacob Grossman and
William McDonough being among
those who have been assigned to this
task. Thomas Zehan has been
painting traffic signs for a month and
ahalf.
A half dozen policemen, among
them Fred Derrick and E: H. Jones,
are building a garage in the rear of
police headquarters, a task in which
they have been engaged for the last
three , days.
"The Republican party in this city
is crying that it is the friend of la
bor and unionism and it has the au
dacity one week before election to
allow the heads of the police ..depart
ment who are appointed and control!
ed by them to rob union labor of
jobs that should foe given them," said
a labor leader in an interview with a
Farmer reporter today. "In no oth
er city in this country would such
conditions be tolerated."
It is understood on good authority
that the police commissioners, desir
ing to reward . certain faithful ma
chine workers in this city who are de
sirous of Joining the police force
and have been promised positions,
hope to foe able to save enough money
by the difference in labor expense and
contract price to appoint, the men.
Police officers, those of whom are
tradesmen, are almost in a state of
open rebellion by this action of their
superiors. "I left my trade," stated
one, "because I didn't like it. If they
are going to make a painter out of me
I can 5 earn about twice as much a day
as the police . department pays me
working at my trade."
It will be several weeks before the
men will foe finished building the gar
age and painting.
"There are two or three foarbers on
the force,", stated a policeman today,
"and several tailors. Perhaps they
will pull them off the street to shave
the superior officers and make their
clothes for them."

British steamer Marina with loss of American lives. They also
were expecting affidavits and other data gathered from Am

pledges to the United States had been broken. 1
A news despatch from Athens last night saying the Greek
government had been notified that Germany intended to sink
without warning all ships carrying supplies to the allies was
regarded here as of great importance. So far as is known
the United States received no

Secretary Lansing said today that
the United States understanJds Ger
many's pledges not to sink merchant

viding for the safety of passengers and
crew applies to ships with defensive
armament. No distinction was d'rawn
in the correspondence between armcl
and unarmed ships and the state de
partment" does not accept any conten
tion that Germany's responsibility Is
limited to those without armament.
Nevertheless, it is admitted that Ger

of the status of the armed ships and
it Is thought probable that she will at
tempt to inject the point Into the pres
ent situaiion.
So long as the policies of the two
governments are so utterly divergent
it is thought possible that Germany
might wsn the Marina case to settle
the issue. Her increasefdj submarine
warfare, combined with the increasing
nurnber of armed allied ships and
their Increasing efiiciency In defense,
makes it a vitaI-4uestion to her.
Secretary Lansing, while refusing to
give but any further details of the
official report of the sinkings from the
American embassy In London, said his

SIX AMERICANS KILLED.
London, Nov. 2 A telegram to th
American embassy today from Wesley
Frost, American consul at Queens
town, states that the discrepancies in
former reportsjregarding the number
of Americans on board the British
steamship Marina and the names' of v
those lost have now been cleared up.
In addition to the five Americans
reported yesterday as having been
lost the name of Buie, given in earlier
advices as saved, is added to the list
of dead. The name of Middleton, first
reported lost, is now in the list of
American survivors. These changes
make the total number of Americana
on board 52, of whom six were lost.
The filing of the Deu'tchland's man
ifest was awaited with curiosity. Cap
tain Koenig, estimating the cargo to
reach $10,000,000 in value, said it
j consisted largely of drugs and dye-
stuffs, but there were possibly securi
ties and jewels among the consign
ments. As the Deutschland on her
trip to Baltimore carried only $1,500,
000 worth of freight which bulked as
large as her present shipments. It waa
considered probable that most of the
$10,000,000 valuation was represented
by securities or stones.
Henry G. Hilken, of Baltimore.pres
ident of the Eastern Forwarding Co,,
said today he was without exact in
formation on this subject. ' Dr. George
Aherns, an attache of the German em

The Deutschland's captain refused
