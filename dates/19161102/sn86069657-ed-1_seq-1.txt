The Reason Why.
We print oh Second page I lie
order of the Fiscal Court Feb.
28thj which order was signed and
published before ,the election
und this alone secured the vote
for the bonds.
This order is application for
Stale Aid on the six inter-county
seat roads in 1910. The Court
has never-taken any definite steps
to improve but two roads in 1016
though some of the roads have of
fered to do all the surveying at
no expense to the county and the
people on one of these roads have
offered to build all the road for
what subscription money could
be raised on its merits and the
State Aid.
If the Court will not improve
these roads, during 1916, when
under promise to do so und espe
cially when the people" at one
time have offered to put up the
county's part, if necessary, what
hope have they that they will ev
er get a road Inter? The people
are in open arms against such a
disappointment. They are not
paying their road tax this year,
mill-never will. Such imposition
cannot be pulled off on the peo
ple of Powell county. They
mean business.
The taxpayers of Powell coun-t-y
are asked to paj 50 cents per
hundred dollars road tax, and
aoX living in.the country, .of
propetgettre equlred;t-wor
the road six days in the year. be
sides, and tor this they receive
less than one dollar per mile for
teams on their road. This is not
fair and the taxpayers are show
ing you hoW they propose to not
- bear it. No court iu the world
will uphold such an uneven prop
osition, we believe. Give us the
roads you promised before the
bonds were voted or no tax can
you collect.
A part of the Fiscal Court, we
are sure, is anxious to do just as
they promised, but are handi
capped. . Death of Robert Martin.
Mr. Robert Martin, aged sixty
nine, died Tuesday morning at
7 :40 from lagrippe and other
troubles. Funeral services Wed
nesday at Cane creek Christian
church by the Rev. Cleo Purvis,

Repairs Road.
A. T. Whltt and others have
found it necessary to have a por
tion of the Lulbegrud road re
paired so that automobile traffic
may continue on this road. Since
the train has changed time and
gets in here so late at nights, au
tomobile traffic has become very
active in and out of this town. A
.'bus line scheduled to arrive here
about two hours earlier than the
train could soon build up a "land
office" business.
