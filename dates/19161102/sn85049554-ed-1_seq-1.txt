then abandoned the train, carrying the

There were approximately 200 of the
bandits in the conimand which held up
the train as It «?as apjftoochlng La

against the sky line,
vcould
be seen
plainly by the engine crew and pas
sengers before the train was stopped,
but because of -the-nature of the coun
try escape was impossible. After com
manding the engineer to stop, one of
the bandits-went- thru the train order

The conductor. Whose name is not
known, was shot in .the hip by a

in Waahington to Include Veatala
Armed For Dsfensfr—Now Threatens
AH 8hips Carrying 8uppliea to Alliea.
Washington, Nov. 2.—State depart
ment officials still were waiting today
for Germany's version of the destruc
tion of the British steamer Marina.
They also expected affidavits from
American survivors on which to deter
mine whether Germany's pledges to the'
United States had been broken.
A dispatch from the Greek govern
ment last night, that It had been noti
fied. that Germany had' threatened to
sink alt-ships carrying supplies to the
allies, was regarded here as of great
importance.
It is not known whether such a warn
ing has been sent to other neutrals.
Such a proceeding would be regarded
by the United States as. directly con
trary to Germany's piedges.
Secretary Lansing said today that the
United States understand^ Germany's
pledges not to sink merchantmen with
out warning and without providing for
the safety of passengers and crews ap
plied also to ships with defensive arma
ment. No distinction was drawn in
the correspondence between armed and
unarmed ships.
May Settle Diaputod taaue.' --/i
Nevertheless, it Is admitted that Ger
many has always taken a distinct view
of tne status of armed ships and it is
thought probAble she will Attempt to
lnjeot the point into, the present situa
tion. So long ••.the pollcleaof thet^yo
governments are so utterly divergent,
it Is thought, posslbls thatv Germany
may use the Marina ease to aettle the
issue.
Secretary Lansing, while refusing to
|lvs out any further details of the of
ficial report of the sinking ^Crom the
American embassy In London, said hisV
Information is substantially the, same
as.' that ojt the newspapers.
Germany and-'Austria, on- Feb. lfl .ta
substantially the same termscnotified
the United states to the following ef
fect: Enemy- merchantmen armed
with guns no.ionger' have the right to
fie considered as peaceable merchant
vessels of commerce. Therefore, the
German naval forces will be ordered to
treat such vessels as belligerents.
However, in answering the note of
America on the Sussex, demanding the
abandonment of its submarine warfare
agalst "passenger and freight-carry
ing vessels," Germany said such ves
sels Would not be sum without warn
ing and without providing for the safety
of passengers and crews "unless such
ahips attempt to escape."
Six Amaidoana Lotf in Marina.
London, Nov. 2.—-A telegram to -the
'American embassy today from Wesley
Frost American consul at Queenstown,
states that the discrepancies in former
reports-regarding the number of Amer
icans on board the British steamship
Marina and the names of those lost
have now been cleared up., In addition
to the five Americans reported yester
day as lost, the name of Bule, given- in
earlier advices as Brue, Is added to the
list of dead. The name of Middletown,
first reported lost, is now in the ll*t of
American survivors. These changes
make the total number of Americans on
board fifty-two, of whom six were lost.

Undersea Merchantman News of
8afe Arrival Not Officially An
nounced in Germany.
New London, Conn., Nov. 2.—Activi
ties of a varied nature centered aboui
the Deutschland and her captain, Paul
Koenlg, today. While the crew busied
themselves behind the barriers which
hide the submarine from public view,
preparing to dispose' of the valuable
cargo which the Deutschland brought
from Bremen, customs officials pre
pared for the Inquiry to determine the
status of the craft. The Deutschland
has been entered as a merchant ves
sel, but to make certain of her status
an inquiry was determined on.
Commander Stirling, hesd of the
naval station here, arranged to go
aboard with his aides, in conjunction
with James McGovern, collector of
CuSlCutS «I* t&iS A asv
had conferred last night with Secre
tary of the Treasury McAdoo, who was'
at Hartford, regarding the questions
Involved in the Deutschland's appear
ance.
Reception For Crew.
New London citizens made plans to
welcome the commander and the sub
marine's crew. President Miner, of the
chamber of commerce, with Mayor E.
Rogers and a delegation of business
men, Invited Captain Koenig to a din
ner at a date to be set by him. It was
jnald he had accepted, altho stating it
wa* with reluctance.
The announcement of the Deutsch
land's manifest was awaited with some
Interest. The cargo was estimated to
be of $10,000,000 value. It was said to
consist largely of drugs and dyestuffs,
but there are possibly securities and
jewels among the consignments. As the
Deutschland on her trip to Baltimore
carried only 1,500,000 worth of freight,
whlch-bulketf ^s large as her present
shipment* It Is Considered probable that
.more of the^JJ.0,000,000 valuation was
represented by" securities or precious
stones. Henry G. Hilketo, of Baltimore,
president of the Eastern Forwarding
Company, which is agent'fdr the sub
marine freight service here, said today
he was without exact Information on
this subject.
Ail Visitors Barrad.
Dr. George Ahrens, an' attache of
the German embassy, and President
Hllkeiv went aboard the Deutschland
this morning to greet her skipper. The
captain refused a plea that he allov
the public to view his craft. None but
government or city officials might en
ter the enclosure, he said, and the re
strictions that prevailed ta Baltimore
are In effect again.
Admits Bremen is Lost.
The joy of the Germans who came
here to welfeomo'the Deutschland was
dampened by the announcement
brought by Captain Koenig that the
Bremen had been lost at sea. He said
it sailed from Bremen on Aug. 26 and
started on the English Channel routo
to New London.
He said the German government had
positive knowledge that It had been
lost in an' accident due either to a
storm or a collision. Captain Schwa rtz
kopf, a friend of Captain Koenig, was
commander of the Bremen, which car
ried a cargo of dyes and chemicals and
had a crew of twenty-eight men.
"That the English have captured
her," said Captain Koenig, "I can say
is absolutely" untrue. The Bremen was
lost at sea, and that we know. She
was not sunk by the enemy."
Mystery had been thrown about the
cargo- of the Deutschland. It was at
first announced that it consisted of
dyes and drugs, as did the first cargo
of the Deutschland. But It was said
later by Captain Koenig that the cargo
this time was worth $10,000,000, while
the first oargo was worth but $1,
500,000.
It was learned on good authority
that the high value of .the Deutschland
cargo is due to the fact that it carries
a large amount of securities, as well
as large consignments of precious
stonea.
Bringa Mail.
Bags at mall brought across thn seas
by the Deutschland were brought
ashore today.Shortly before noon May
or Rogers, President M. T. Miner, of
the chaimlber of commerce, and about
fifty-Ave members, constituting a com
mittee, waited upon Captain Koenig.
There was a conference on the pier
and the cijpta'ln accepted the invita
tion to a dipner given by the chamber,
the time to be fixed later.
The party was then divided Info
groups of Ave' stud each went on tihe
submarine" and looked ft over.
Caipt. T. A. Scott, of the Scott
Wrecking Company, sent a diver down
alongside the Deutschland and he re
ported there were fourteen small holes
in the anchor bulkhead. These were
probably made when the anohpr dented
the vesaal.

letln issued by the National GRyJBank:
The advisability of making further
foreign loans is strongly urged. The
bulletin declares ^the nation Is doing
business under conditions which are
calculated to encourage people to go
Into debt. It points out that with
money easy, interest rates low and
profits from business unusually large,
there Is a great temptation to borrow
money to buy stock of companies tha'.
are making great earnings. High prices
for farm products, it Is said, will en
courage farmers to buy land.
The total of foreign, loans made in
the United States since the outbreak of
the European war, is placed by the
bank at $2,138,257,637, of which $156.
400,000 has been paid off, leaving a net
total of $l,981r857,637 of loans out
