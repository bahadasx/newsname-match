TOMMIE TOMKINS
Tommy Tomktim Found Guilty an
Charged, But Jury. Recommends
He Be RelwieI -His "Mother's
Bible" and "Good" Witnesses Save
Him.
(By L. ROY FERRIS.)
"Stand up," said Dr. Owl to Tom
mle. "Stand up and tell us your
name."
"It is Tommte Tomkins, sir," be
gan Tommle, "and I" but Dr.
Owl stopped him with a frown, and
the two little bunches of feathers
which most people think are horns,
and from which he gets the name of
horned owl, stood up straight and
caused him to look so fierce. "I
wish to tell you, Thomas, that when
you speak to me you must say,
"Please, Your Honor," for that Is the
way they do at the Court House In
your town, for Bunnle' Screech Owl
who often visits the town at night
told me.
. " Thomas Tompkins," began Judge
Owl, but just then Brownie Screech
Owl slipped up to Judge Owl and
whispered something.
"Search the witness," commanded
Judge Owl, "Brownie Screech Owl
says that is the way they do in the
Court," and Bro. Coon, who really
had no right to do so, for he was
one of the Jury, stepped forward and
put his paw into Tommie's trowsers
pocket. You see Bro. Coon dearly
loves to put his paw into places.
Sometimes he gets caught by reach
ing for a bright piece of tin in an
auger hole that has horseshoe nails
In it to catch his paw.
Bro. Coon pulled out a string Tora
mie used to spin his top.
"What is that?" demanded Judge
Owl. ' '
"It Is something like the chicken
had on its feet that Bro. Coon stole
from Farmer Brown," spoke up Bro.
Rabbit. 4Bro. Coon coughed an em
barrassed little cough and continued
the search, and thus addressed Judge
Owl as he pulled a knife from Tom
mie's pocket. "Why, it's what Tom
mie's father used to put the lock on
. the parlor door and Tommie's motu
er uses to open the cans of tomatoes
' when she can't find the can opener
and it could also be used to clean
''. one's finger nails." Tommie quickly
put his bands into his coat pockets,
for his finger nails bad black mar
gins around the ends that looked like
be was mourning for for his grand
mother. "Ah," said Judge Owl, as be no
iced Tommie's finger nails, but he
made no comments, and right here
let me say that no matter bow good
a little boy may be he must keep his
finger nails trimmed, or Judge Owl
will see them and tell all the ani
mals In the forest.
About this time Bro. Coon pulled
a piece of candy from Tommie's pock
et and quietly put it in his mouth,
but Bro. Rabbit's sharp eyes saw
and he made up his mind to see that
Tommie got fair play.
Bro. Grey Squirrel had a high seat
in a grape vine swing right' over the
place where Tommie was a prisoner.
It had started to climb the tall elm
when it was only a little slip of a
vine not near as large as the ones
your father set out in the grape ar
bor. If it had looked to see how far
it had to climb to reach the top it
might have given up, like the Per
kins boy does when he comes to a
hard lesson, but instead it had 'taken
a hold on the tree to win, just like
you will win if you try, try again.
It bad climbed the tree antK grown
so strong that all the little boys In
town could not put it down. So you
see it pays never to give up.
At this point Brother Bull Frog
began to ask questions. The Gray
6quirrel acted as Tommie's ilawyer.
Bull Frog said he would plead his
own case.
"Why didn't you . shine your
shoes?" asked Bull Frog. And
right there Tommie resolved to never
again neglect to have his shoes in
good order. "I do believe," said Bull
Frog, before Tommie could answer,
"I do believe he has another rock In
his pocket.'' Brother Coon, take
it from him before he does some
harm."
- "It does make my blood boil," said
Bull Frog, " to see"
"Who ever heard of a snake or
turtle, Huh or frog haying blood that
would boil?" said Gray Squirrel.
But a look from Judge Owl caused
.him to be still.
Bro. Coon took the object from
Tommie's pocket.
"Please, your honor," begged
Tommie, "take my knife, and my kite
string, and my candy, and my flsh-
hooks but don't take that."
"Why, why, what Is it?" asked
Judge Owl, as each one of the jury
examined it in turn.
Gray Squirrel. After much besltat-!
Ing and clearing of throat, Judge'
Owl red this these words: "This lit-;
1 Owl read these words: "This Bi-j
, ble is given to Tommie Tompkins!
by his mother. May be always con-'
tinue to be kind to everything and
, everybody and grow to be a good ,
man." 1
By this time Brother Rabiblt had
real tears in his eyes, and after.
Brothers Skunk and Rattlesnake had
testified Brother Rabbit was seen to;
whisper to Red Squirrel, Terrapin
"and Sister Possum. , - I
"I beg Your Honor to confine the
, pribouer tn the hollow stump jail." ,

L. Rov Ferris' woodomft storv in
The Message this week Is an extra
p-nnri nnn. Our bov and girl readers
will all be interested in how Tommie
Tomkins escaped a sentence In the
hollow stump Jail.
While the Jury was taking a vote
Brother Chicken Hawk solemnly led
Tommie and put him in the hollow
stump Jail. x
"Brother Rabbit, read the ver
dict." commanded Judge Owl a few
minutes lafr, and Brother Rabbit,
taking a piece of burch bark from
under his arm, began as follows:
"We, the jury, recommend. Your
Honor, that you confine Thomas
Tomkins in the Hollow Stump Jail
in utter darkness, and suggest that
you only give him one small bunch of
black haws and a few wild grapes to
eat each day for such time until the
small hickorv sanllng shall have
grown as large an the sycamore was
on which Your Honor is holding
court: but, whereas, we find upon
questioning Tlncy Field Mouse and
Gentle Dove and after listening to
the testimony of the Robin Family
and such good folks as Sweet Mock
er and her cousin, the Thrush, that
Thomas Tomkins is not only not
guilty but is deserving of a great
deal of credit, for did not Gross
Beak and Flicker both testify to hav
ing seen him sawing wood for Old
Granny Larkin, who is most a hun
dred years old? We recommend,
Your Honor, that you turn him loose
and give him the freedom of the
woods,, for we love that kind of a
boy."
About that time Tommie' felt
something grab him bv the shoulder,
and he heard little Laura Jenkins
say, "Why, hleas my heart, what are
you doing here asleep? Good thing
brother and I came this wav to gath
er golden rod, to decorate the school
room and wo will have to hurry or
we will be late."
. As Tommie looked back, rould he
believe his eyes, there sat Old Bro.
Bull Frog, and what do you think
he winked at Tommie. '
