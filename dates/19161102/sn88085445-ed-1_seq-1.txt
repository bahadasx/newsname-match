THE VALUE OF SAVING
"Habit is a cable; we weave a
Oread of it every day and at last
wt. cannot break it." Saving is a
habit. Each penny that we save Is
a thread woven into the habit cable
of saving.
A grown person always finds
that some ready cash comes in
handy and if he owns a bank-book
that tells him of the money he lias.
It makes him feel more Independ
ent. The sooner a person begins U>
save, the more money there will ho
when he is grown.
In another way, saving is valu
able. A person who saves <loes not
spend money on foolish things which
will harm him physically and men
tally.
A boy or girl needs to know
about saving because It is when we
are young that good or bad habits
are formed most easily and if we
cannot resist the temptation 10
spend all we earn when we are old
er we may know it is because we
did not resist the temptation when
we were young.

JERSEY BREEDERS WILL
FORM AN ORGANIZATION
An organization of ihe breeders
ol Jersey cattle of Whatcom County
will be formed shortly, as ihe re
sult of a visit over the district this
week by E. L. Brewer of Sat sop,
field agent for the American ,Ters> y
Cattle Club. The organization wl.l
discuss their problems, and wiR eo
opetate in raising the standards of
the Jersey type locally.
A union may be effected with
similar societies witch Mr. Brewer
Is organizing in Skagit and Snohom
ish County.
Mr. Brewer believes he will be
nbln to prove, through the Associa
tion that the Jersey yields Ihe
tnost, in proportion to the feed BOB*
■timed. The Importation of proper
herd sires will mean much to the
Jersey interests in Whatcom Coun
ty he declares.
That the splendid Satsop herd of
Jerseys, owned by Mr. Brewer,
Which won the prizes at the San
Francisco exposition will be brought
to Lynden next year for exhibition
at Fair time, is one of the plans of
Mr. Brewer.
Children's Teeth Neglected
A recent investigation made by
the U. S. Public Health Service in
connection with studies of rural
school children showed that 49.3
pel cent had defective teeth, 21.1
per cent hud two or more missiny
teeth, and only 16.9 per cent had
had denial attention. Over 14 per
cent never used a tooth brush, 58.2
per cent used one occasionally and
only 27.4 per cent used one dally.
Defective teeth reduce physical ef
ficiency. Dirty, suppurating, Bitag
gle-toolhed mouths are responsible
for many cases of heart disease,
rheumatism, and other c'ronic-af
fections. The children tire not re
sponsible for the neglected state of
ineir teeth. The ignorant and care
less parent is to blame for this con
dition —a condition Which hampeis
mental and physical growth and
puts a permanent handicap on our
future citizens. School teach*'*
can and are doing much in inculcat
ing habits of personal cleanliness
on the rural scitool child but this
will fail of the highest accomplish
ment unless parents co-operate
heartily and continuously.
Aa They Used to View the Plague.
An old work, a little book published
In Cologne In 1008 under the title o
"Geistltche und Letbllche Ar/.tene
Wider die Pest." gives a crude oxpbiuu
tion of the plague and Its ravages
From this book we learn thai it i
due to the eccentric movement of the
planets, eclipses of the moon or sun
inundations, earthquakes, famines and
wars. Often also it follows tbe bail
effluvium set up by pigs, docks and
geese. It Is frequently attributable to
tbe angaf of God for man's sins, such
as Injustice In the law courts, the op
pression of subjects by their rulers,
the dearuess of goods, the dunce and
gaming.
