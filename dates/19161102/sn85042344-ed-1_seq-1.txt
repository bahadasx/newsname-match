Charles B. Hughes wound up hl
campaign In the middle wont with a
speech here tonight and left Hhorily
afterward for point In Now York, tho
luHt Mute in which he will uppeur be
toru election.
Mr. Hughes made fivo speeches to
day. Tonight he Issued the following
statement:
"I am leaving Indiana after whul
is perhaps the most wonderful recep
tion ever given a candidate for tho
presidency.
"TIiIh nplendtd tribute was not to
me j-ersonnlly, but as the representn
Uve of the grout united Republican
party moving forward to victory and
service for the nation. The men of
Indiana have organized a people's vic
tory and I want to thank tho loader
of the reunited Republican party lor
their effective work."
Fours Bread Mill'.
Mr. Hughes today devoted much of
his speeches to the tariff.
"Wo had soup nouses and bread
lines twenty mouths ago," he told his
audience at Linton, "and wo will have
them again if we do nut protect
American industry and if we uttempt
to carry on the business of this coun
try on the policy Indicated in the l'n
deTwood bill."
"Whon the war orders end," he said
at Brail, "under our present policy as
embodied in the Underwood bill
passed by our opponents, you can Just
eo yourself going buck to work for
one or two or three days a week. That
la wlni t It means to you."
Tonight Mr, Hughes discussed tho
Adamson bill at length.
"I am ndvised that the general
chairman has advised the local chair
man of the Brotherhood of locomo
tive Firemen and riiginonion of tnw
l'ennsylvaniu lines eust, that the Ad
umson bill l'n establlsning a new basis
for reckoning wagos, will eliminate
the payment of all arbltrurius which
are bused upon time made within tho
first eight-hour porlod of service.
"The uncertainty of the law Is rec
OgnUod In various particulars. It Is
said what It will lie decided to mean
no one can now toll, as It is possible
to construe It In several dllfurent
ways. Tho chairman also adds 'this
law does not change the application
of the hours of service law. The com
pany still has the right to 'work vou
IS hours within anv 24 consecutive
hours If they so desire.'
"I note that the chief of one of the
locals of one of the brotherhoods has
ascertained tho effect of the (aw on
those who complete their run in less
than eight hours. He says that ir
man makes a hundred-mile run in
five hours Instead of getting his full
day's pay he will only got five-eighths
of a day's pay when paid on the eight
hour basis. He also says that for
merly the railroad men were entitled
to pay for 25 miles whenever called
out, whether they were used after re
porting or not. Hut the Adamson bill
enacts a flat basis of clirht hours fnr
the purpose of paying compensation,
whilo on the other hnnd It does not
establish an eight-hour work day.
Is a (Jolil Brick.
T Ihinlr It ti'Ml Ita fonl .tint IhA
Adamson bill Is a gold brick for labor.
That Is, not un eight-hour work day
bill. Thero was not any eight-hour
work bill proposition Involved In it.
Things that are right can walk in
their own clothes; we have things that
are right it we go at them in the
right way.
"Wo have won a great denl in this
country In getting free Institutional
and when you summarize It all it
merely means the rule of public opin
ion, after discussion, according to
what we think are tho metlts of tho
case. It does not mean a rule of force
at all. That will knock everything
out. You will not have any work at
all If that Idea once gets abroad in
thlj country."
QUESTION OF NEW
SCHOOL BUILDING-
lYoplc of Hartlesvllle Will Vote On
Bond Issue of $100,000 lit
General Election.
Bpeeinl to Tha World.
BARTLESYILLE, Okla., Nov. 1
Bartlesville Is to hold a special bond
election on the data of the general
election to vote upon the question of
a $100,000 bond issue for n junior
high school building. Last April the
proposition was submitted to a vote
of the people and while the bond is
sue carried, It lost by reason of tho
fact that the total vote cnit did not
represent two-thirds of the vote cast
at the las previous eleo lon whloh is
required by law. This will bs the sec.
end election on the question of a bond
issue.
Barttesvllte schools are In a crowd
ed condition, mora so than ever in
their history. It has reached a point
where the board would have to take
steps to build another ward school
which would only tneot the present
conditions for a couplo of years or
else build a modern junior high sohool
building-. If the bond Issue cantos
this will be the first city in the state
to build a junior high sohool build
tag.

KENDALL TAKES
STEP INTO CITY
At Meeting Last Night Cit
izens Prepare to Veto
Water Bonds.
LITTLE DELAY NOW
Actual Amalgamation Will
Follow Closely on Heels
of Movement.
ASSURANCE that the community
of Kendall will soon become a
part of lirinter Tulsawas given at
a mass meeting In Kendall college
auditorium last night.
Plans preliminary to the election
which will amalgamate Kendall and
Tulsa were formulated.
It wax decided to vote bonds for a
sewer system and city water service
I t fore coming into tho city. Theso
bonds will bo assumed by the entire
city when Kendall becomes a part
of it.
The Kendall citizens last night
adopted resolutions asking the city
government to give them tho services
of the engineering department for tho
purpose of making an estimate on the
probable cost of sewers and water.
It has been roughly estimated that
tho sewers will cost $35,000 and the
water installation $40,000
Tulsa Is Heady.
Mayor J. H. Simmons attended last
night's meeting and assured the Ken
dall residents that the city admin
istration was ready to do everything
in Its power to help them helome a
part of the city. President Evans of
Kendall college spoke la bohnlf of the
citizens and urged that all delays pos
sible be avoided in bringing about the
urion
J. It. Suthorlin of the Siitherlin
Brolu'iigc company of Kaneas C'ltv
told '.he citizens that his firm stood
ready to buy tho Kendall bonds pro
viding they could have a voice In
awarding the sewer and water con
tracts. This proposition wag reject
ed, it being the unanimous sentiment
that t o strings should be attached to
the bond Issue.
The length of time until Kendall U
a part of Tulsa depends upon the
speed with which the bond election
can be called. After the bonds are
voted It will only be n short stop to
the complete amalgamation.
ECHOES OF GORE
CASE DYING
OUT
Special to The, World.
OKLAHOMA CITY. Nov. 1. Grad
ually the echoes of the famous dam
age suit against United Slates Sena
tor Gore In which Minnie Bond sued
him for $50,000 damages, and which
for the time being was the center of
attraction In the United States, are
dying out. S. P. Render of this city
assisted In furnishing the money for
the prosecution of the case, and Ross
Llllard of this city was one of the
attorneys for the plaintiff. Some
time after the cane was concluded
Llllard brought suit against Render
for attorneys' foes amounting to
about $1,600. Ho secured Judgment
in the lower court for the amount and
Render appealed to the supreme
court. Recently the htgh court de
cided in Llllard' favor. Rendor
asked for a rehearing, which was de
nied. Then he filed a second peti
tion for a rehearing. The supreme
court today again denied the rehoar
lng. It Is possible this will be the last
effort to reopen the case.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. So many
conflicting elements have ap
peared in the destruction of the Brit
ish ship Marina by a G?rmun subma
rine with the loss of American lives
that the Incident throates to fall Into
a technical discussion -ather than a
clean-cut issue of whether Germany
has violated her pledges to the United
Stales.
It became quite apparent today
both from the attitude of the stuto
department and from '.he dispatches
from abroad that much which is ea
rn utial to a determination of tho ro
s' nsibility remains undisclosed if In
deed the United Ntat.s, Germany or
Great Britain are In possession of ths
full .facts.
It appeared certain, however, that
no mov will be made by the I'nlted
States until tho Go"m-in version of
the affair as well as that of tho de
struetlon of the British ship Rowun
more by shell fire with endangering
of Americans has ben secured.
Bcrnstorrf Talks.
Tho only positive developments to
day were the action of Count von
Bernstoi ff, the German ambassador In
full details by wireless and the Issu
ance of a statement by Secretary
Uinsinir that tho Investigation would
be in no wise delayed because there
is a political campaign In progress.
While they await full details two
outstanding facts attracted the atten
tion of officials.
One was the announcement that ths
Marina was armed with a 4.7-Inch
gun mounted astern; the other was a
news dispatch from London the lan
guage of which was regarded as sig
nificant. It said:
"It Is regarded here us quite prob
able that the American state depart
ment will make ttill further Inquiries
wth the obje-t of definitely determin
ing the status of the Marina. Whilo
it Is said that she was under private
charter when she. was torpedoed. It
ri PI cars that the vessel may have en
gaged In admiralty work not long be
fore." This was generally construed as re
flecting some Indications of doubt in
London over whether the thlp was
entitled to tho immunities of a peace
ful merchantman.
Hasn't Altered Policy.
The United States government,
however, never has altered Its policy
of regarding merchant ships tempor
arily in admiralty service, as merchant
(.hips still unless they have been ac
tually taken over by a belligerent
navv and manned with i naval crew.
The question of tho Marina's arma
ment, however. Is likely to become tho
prliit on which tho .--ase will revolve
unless other circumstances arise to
clearly define the fss'to In another
dirf ctlon.
"It brings tho submarine question
tack to a point where Germany and
the United States have held to di
rectly opposite views. Germany hns
steadfastly contendod that In view of
novel conditions surrounding subma
rine warfare and In view of the Brit
ish admiralty's alleged Instructions to
merchant ?aptalns to destroy enemy
submersible, any armed ship was li
able to destruction on flight and with

John Copehind of Marshall, accused
of Ihe killing of William Black, an
Iinti-Cuthollc lecturer, at Marshall on
February 3, 101S, this morning
brought In a vordlst of not guilty.
Twice during their deliberations the
Jury hud reported to Judgo Clay Stone
Brlggs of tho Tenth district court, that
they could not reach a verdict and
each time hud been sent hack for fur
ther consideration of the ease. Mon

At 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
Jury came Into court ami asked for
tho second time to bo excused because
of Inability to reach a verdict. Judgo
Brlggs declined tho request and told
tho Jurors to return to their room and
como to a decision.
Word was received from the Jury-
room this morning that a verdict had

After the verdict had been turned
In, the Jury was polled and each man

slocks, bonds and precious stones,"
comprise the cargo of tho Cerman
submarine merchantman Deutschland,
according to a statement tonight by
('apt. I'uiil Koenlg, communder of
tho crufl.
The Ueutschland Is In this port after
having succeeded In making u second

Aiiierlcun coast despllo the watchful

keep open a trade route with ' the
United States, tho Heutschlund, ac

the only vessel of that fleet. The
Bremen, which started a voyage from
tho city ufter which she was named
on August 2K, he said, bus been given
up us lost. lie thought she "must
have struck u nunc,'' but he added
"sho bus not fallen a victim to this
almost blockade, 1 am sure of that,"
Was no AincrlUu.
The Amerika, which some reports
have Indicated was u merchant sub
marine captured by the British, never
existed. Captain Koenlg asserted. "I
must keep up this truffle ulone for the
present, that Is the Peiitschlund
must." ho said. "In a foitnighl I shall
bo gone. 1 hope to return before the
end of the year."
It was possible, the navigator statod.
that other merchant submarines
would be built by that time.
In a summary of his voyage Just
completed. Captain Koenlg, who re
turned with decorations from Herman
royalty as murks of recognition for his
pioneer voynge, said this wus "a quiet
trip." Recital of Its Incidents, how
ever, developed matters of lively In
terest. The neiitschlund did not lie
on the ocenn floor this time as in
the voyage which ended at Baltimoro
lust July. The submarine Instead,
varied tho monotony of Us sailing
under water or on the surface with
occasional dodges beneiilh vessels
Identified as warships of bolligerent
nationality or thought to be. Seven
times Captain Koemg said he maneu
vered In this way. The lust time was
off Nantucket yesterday whon ho
sighted a "four-fiinncled steamer"
and dived beneath her. Tho storms
gnvo us more troublo than this so
culled blockade," he continued. "Wo
were beset by heavy southwest gules
for days and thoy were with us most
of the way across. Fog also hindered
us. Wo might as well have been sub.
mnrlned tho weather was so thick at
times."
Tho superstructure of the Deutsch
land wns dented by the blows of Ihe
seas, but sho suffered no sovero dam
ages, her commander said.
"Leaving Brenion on October 1 the
Deutschland had moved only a short
distance out of the harbor when she
came In collision with a tug. The
Deutschland was forced to roturn lor
repairs. The venture was begun again
on October 10 and the engines after
being started on that day wore not
stopped until the Heutschlund carno

Kept I'imIit Surface.
Captain Koenlg said tho Deutsch
land was kopt under way on the sur
face during most of the disturbance,
but at times ho had her submerged
and under water she "moved up and
down easily with the sous."
So severe was the storm that at
times the submarine made only a mile
an hour headway. In all she was
delayed three days, her cuptuln fig
ured, and fuel was consumed at a
rate far In excess of normal. The
Deutschland was still suppllod for
"nearly thirty days" when she tame
In, he said.
During the trip of 4.500 miles tho
Deutsohland traveled under water less
than one hundred miles. "95, t should
think," Captain Koenlg said.
Not .Much Blockade,
"They call It a blockade! Tou cut
Judge how much It blocks," the skip
per exclalmod.
The submarine brought no medt
olne that might contain relief from
Infantile paralysis. There Is such a
serum In Oormany, Captain Koenlg
said, but its development requires test
through monkeys.
"There are no more monkeys In
Germany since the war so they can
not make It, ' was his explanation.
