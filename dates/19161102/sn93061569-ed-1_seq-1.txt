"A REPLY AND
t
A
The Union County Central Com
mittee has extensively distributed . a
circular bearing upon the' official rec
ord of Qrie L. Philips, -as assistant
District Atorney, charging said Phil
lips with having taken sides against
Colfax county in suits to protect pow
erful corpdratons and wealthy indi
viduals from law enforcement; with
having compiled the District Court
to appoint a special prosecutor in
State vs. Dewey Johnson for the kill
ing of N. A. Hypes, at the expense
of Union County; yith having required
Judicial pressure as an inducer;', unt for
him to act in State vs. Mansker, and
having bitterly criticized -the Hon.
Thos. D. Leib for appointing a special
prosecutor when he, (Phillips( failed
Jco act.
Hugh B. Woodward, Union County
spokesman for Phillips, and other Re
publicans characterize the matters in
the above referred to circulars, and
briefly mentioned above, as campaign
lies. Thereupon, The Democratic Com
mittée verbally challenged Mr. Wood
ward to meet Democratic speakers in
public discussion on said charges, so
that arguments and proofs relative to
the charges might be submitted to the
public. Mr. Woodward pleaded in
ability on the part of himself or his
republican friends to participate in
such a discussion because of nearness
of the election. He only had time to
pay that we were lying and that it
would not be ednvenient for himself or
Phillips to enter into joint debate of
the natter and thus give us an op;or
tunity of driving irrevocably home the
truth of our charges against Phillips.
Following is a copy of a v, riten chal
lenge, directed to Messrs. Palmer and
Hugh B. Woodward, which was handed
to them in persons on the evening of
October;- 20, at which timo a verbal
demand was made for a prompt re
ply, either accepting or rejecting its
terms, but no answer is forthcoming.
This letter speaks for 'tl? and
shows tnere is no shri(dnir of respon
sibility for telling the truth on Phil
lips. October SO, 1916.
Mr. R. Q. Palmer, Cftrimwn, Un
ion County Republican Central Com
mittee, Mr. Hugh B: Woodward, Union
County Spoi lsman for Orio L. rhil
lips. Republican Candidate for Dis
trict AttoriH-y, Eighth District.
Clayton, New Mexico.
Gentlemen :-
The Union County Democratic Cen
tral Comnittee have gotten out and(
widely circulated certain printed mat
ter benring rather directly upon the
official record of said Orle L. Phillips
as Assistant District Attorney, Eighth
District, and you gentlemen as 'veil as
certain of your Candidates and the
. Clayton Citizen, editoria'ly, have char
acterized charges in said printed mat
ter as campaign lies. Briefly, it was
charged therein that said Phillips has
represented powerful corporations and
wealthy individuals of Colfax County
in suits to restrain the officials of that
county from selling the property of
said corporation and individuals for
the collection of delinquent taxes, and
drawing fees therefor while it was 1
lllil OWUl II IIVI J'Mlll 11 ,4(bJI,
the law, to represent the said county
of Colfax in such matters; that Phil
lips was acting illegally and in viola
tion of his official oath in representing
outside interests in suts against the
county when he was sworn and paid
to represent the county; that a Special
Attorney had to be employed and ap
pointed by Hon. Thos. D. Lieb to pros
ecute Dewey Johnson for the murder
of N. A. Hypes, at the expense of the
voters, Philips roming in later and
asking permission to assist, under
pressure of public ojik.íw; that the
, pleadings in n mandnmuH'vproceeding
had to be by the Court, read ttf Phil
lips before he would take action
against R. T. Mansker, deposed sher
iff of Union County; that' Thillips was
entitled to no credit because of the
pleas of güilty entered by seventeen
CHALLENGE
gamblers in Clayton at the March,
1915, Term of District Court, owing
to the fact that Judge Leib personal
ly watched said gamblers playing po
or and ordered the above sheriff to
bring them before him; but Phillips
claims, nevertheless, that that is- one
reason why he should be elected.
Each and every charge made as
above stated is true, as will conclus
ively appear from an examination of
the public records of Union and Colfax
counties and other sources of official
information, That you gentlemen, in
your above capacities of either of you,
or said Orie L. Phillips, for himself,
3 hereby challenged to participate in
public discusson of the charges made
aganst Phillips either in Clayton or
at any other point in Union county at
any time after tomorrow night and
before the morning of November 7th.
We desire to subetantiate EVERY
charge.

TO THE VOTERS AND TAXPAY
ERS OF THE EIGHTH JUDI
CIAL DISTRICT
Certain printed dodgers, entitled
"Facts vs. Talk," are being mailed and
otherwise circulated in this District,
by persons unknown, containing state
ments so false and malicious that the
authors dare not sign the same.
They charge that Mr. Crampton and
I while members of the firm of Cramp
ton, Rem ley and Thillips have appear
ed in splits against the County and
Slate while Mr. Rem'.ey appeared for
the Str.te. This firm was not formed
until October 1st, 1915, and neither the
firm nor any member thereof has ap
peared in any casa against the County
or State and the charge is absolutely
false.
They charge m'e with having appear-peai-id
for certain ta-payers in suits
against the County Treasurer while
I have been assistant District AUor
li:fvrriiic the s..me was improp
er. Sec. 23, Cbv. 84, laws 1913 pro
vides: "If the Treasurer shall discover
ny errors in said assessment book
by whiih any injustice would be done
any taxpayer it shall be his duty
to report the same to the District At
torney, and any taxpayer complaining
of any such injustice mr.y submit his
comp'airt to the District Attorney;
and if the District Attorney is satis
fied that chango or correctiqn should
be made so as to avoid injustice to the
taxpayer it shall be his duty to sub
mit the same to the District Court
and ask for an order of that Court
that such charge or ourt'etion should
be made "
Pursuant to' this statute'' I have
brorght in Union and Colfax Counties
a'oo'it "50 suits to corred errors and
nn n it asscmcnts due to inefficient
Democratic taxing officers in Union
County and raises made by a Demo
cratic State Board of Equalization
and a Democratic Tax Commission.
For example a farmer at French,
Colfax Co., only owned three milk cows
an ) a jersey bull and was raised 250
head of range cattle. '
Have I done my duty in correcting
such errors and unjust assessments?
I was appointed Assistant Ditrict
Attorney in March, 1913. At that time
together with Mr. Crampton I was re
presenting certain taxpayers com
plaining pf raises made by the State
Poards. My first duty was to those
clients. I accepted the nppointment
with the express understanding that
I would complete those cases.: We
filed eight suits. I was a party to
and directly interested in two of them.
Both the District Attorney and Attor
ney General of the State appeared
for the State in these cases.
They charge that before I ould
file a complaint to remove Sheriff
Mansker from office in Union County,
the District Judge had to read the
pleadings to me in a mandamus suit
after I had delayed the same three

SO THE VOTERS MAY KNOW
Below we print conies of two tele
grams sent to the board of county
commissioners, requesting certain in
formation that it seems the state tax
commission requires before it can fin
ally approve such levies and without
whose approval would hot or could not
be collected. These telegrams speak
for themselves and this body of of
ficials was appointed by Governor Mc
Donald. v
"Santa Fe, N. M. 9:55 a. m.

R:37 p. m."
Hence, it will be peen from the
above telegrams the necessity of such
information which should have been
filed with the Tax Commission lonfc
before these telegram were sent. The
Taw does rioi "require the Tax Commis
sion to remind officials of their duties
and delinquencies by telegrams but
when these have been neglected and
the interests of the people are about
to suffer from such neglect there
seems to be nothing else left for the
Tax Commission to do. In order to get
this information to the Tax Commis
sion the county superintendent of
schools had to work a half day assist
ing in the preparation of the data re
quired and getting it off to the Tax
Commission so that the interests of
the people should not suffer. This is
another feather in the cap of the coun
ty clerk who is promising the people
that he will give them the same kind
of service and administration in the
future as in the past if re-elected to
the office to which he is aspiring.
Strange he had to call upon a republi
can official toxhelp him out of "hole"
into which his negligence had sorely
plunged mm. Jimmyocracy is ever
thus, incompetent and negligent within
tself and must depend upon the sym
pathy and intelligence of others to
pull it out of its den3 of incapacity
for which service it is always ungrate
ful and unappreciative. Do you want
any more such mal-administration as
a result of incompetency, incapacity
and negligence, or do you want these
matters attended to according to law
and on time ; lsiuro juontoysc is
promising you that he will fully at
tend to the duties of the cilice as re
quired by law and courtesy if yod
elect him to that position, while the
present incumbent, who is hankering
for re-election, promises you to give
you the same kind of service and ad
ministration as in the past. How
seest thou, how thinkest thou, Mr.
Taxpayer-and-Votef ?
Either J. W. Thompson, himself, or
some ore else talking in his behalf
said in his great announcement mani
festo published in the Clayton News
of October 21, 1016:
"On the contrary, his opponent,"
(meaning of course, II. II. Errett)
"has no certificate whatever, of any
kin f or nature. He has tangh' in
n-jthin.-r bat run1.! i. i vü'yro schools
and that only to a lim'ted extent."
The truth is Env.fi holds a .Irst
grade certificate and hr.s held. s,ih
ever since he came to tiyj countv and
stat". It was awarded by the state
board of e-!ivi:!o;j to v:i-n the first
year he came to the conn! v. That, is
a whole lot mor than Thompson
con hi get when he came to the coun
ty. He was award;' d only a tempor
ary first grade and has been working
with "Towsled hair a'l blown about,
lips stuck out in ha'f a pout, eyes
ashauce and face awry, saying "p"
ami thinking "pie," ever since and it
mav be now that he holds n first
grade.
At'uin, the manifesto says: "lie"
í meaning Errett of conrse) "has
taught in nothing but ruiw! and vil
lage schools and that only to a limited
extent.". While that statement is an
unintentional compliment to Errett,
made in nr.norance, or intentional mis
representation cf the facts in the mat
ter, we are going to show you, no
matter what kind of certificates J. W.
Thompson holds that he Í3 incompetent
and unfit to teach either a rural or
village school much less aspire to the
office of county superintendent where
at least an ordinary degree of com
petency and fitness is required both
by law and the nature of the office.
And this we are going to do from
his own report. Thompson has ex
hibited his incompetency in the supor
intendeney of the schools of the village
of Clayton and you will take notice
that he is no longer trying to fill that
position and that if the people of Clay
ton had wanted him they could easily
have had him.
Now to the proof. Thompson made
a "term report" for the term of the
village schools of Clayton "beginning
September 7, 1915 and ending May 12,
1916," hence, that is the latest official
specimen of his work as n "superin
tendent." That report rewired hire
U tale an answer respecting the. kinc
of certificate he hell at close of term.
We give thé line and his answer just
as they appear upon the report. Here
it is: "Kind of Certificate (or permit)
held at close of past term 19115-1916."
"State . Professional." JVe also give
the line in the report "following tliig
one and his answer which is a "Honey
Lou to say the least. Here it is:
Date of Expiration of present valid
New Mexcio certificate.' 'Profession
al." Surely our readers and all the
voters would like to know how to, man
ufacture a DATE out of the word
"PROFESSIONAL." But that is evi
dently a secret of jimmyocracy. But
the worst is yet to come. That report
requires a statement of the total num-
icr of days attended by all the pupils
enrolled in the school and also requires
a statement of the average daily at
tendance of all and actually tells the
teacher how to find this in the follow
ing line: "Number in Average-Daily
Attendance. (Note: Divide total num
ber of days attended In each case bv
the number of d.is School was ac
tually in session-to get average at
tendance.)" Now Thompson gives, as
the total number of days attended, in
that report, 53,495 and 169 as the
number of days school was in session,
which would give an average doily at
tendance, according to the direction
in the report, of 316.5, but Thompson
reports it as 418.1 a difference of
101.6. Now there is evidently a lack
of competence and fitness in such
work. Do you think a teacher who
cannot make out a correct report to
the board' of education where there
is only one small village concerned
would be competent and lit in an of
fico where hundreds of such reports
must he checked over, handled and
corrected every year? If he canqot
make one correct report how can he
correct his own or other's errors? Do
you wonder why the board of educa
tion o" the village of ChyLi rc faded
to employ this man this ye?.r?
In 1914, school district 78 sold $2,
000 in school bonds. Thompson was
agent for Sweet, Causey, Foster Bond
Company of. Denver, Colorado. He
told the clerk of the school district,'
in the presence of the county super
intendent, that he would bid not less
than 96 when the bonds were ofered
for sale. The, result of ihs confidence
in him by the clerk was that no other
special etfort was made by the board
i; t o'.'k r b'-'j. ';"'- hondo were ad
vertised anO on the evening before
the bids were to be opened he sought
';o"rn"')i of ,,( riun'y ti-pasur.-r's
iTce as Lo how many bids had been re
ceived and the oPVc rnsnrpcctingly
ir.i'ornied Irm that none Jvul been re
ceived whereupon he submitted ubid
for $1806 instead of at least $1920
ami more if the market would justify,
what he promised to do 'in the first
place. If you doubt these facts, ask
F. C. de Baea, your county treasurer,
or L. E. Byrne, his deputy, or H. J.
Farr, clerk of the district, or II. II. Er
rett, county superintendent cf schools.
Does this look like getting "for the
districts the highest price," or even
keeping good fa'th wiih the district?
That is how he "gets higher than that
offered by a íy other company" for
the school districts.
The question is, Do you want a man
like Thompson whom you have never
tried as t ;unty superintendent a man
who has been tried as village super
intendent and found wanting ór do
you want a man whom you have tried
for five years and not found wanting
in anything a man approved by all
your hirher up educators in the state,
by all your higher up school officials,
by the democratic, governor of your
state, by all the teachers, boards of
education, boards of school directors,
and patrons of the school of your coun-
W. S. Rowley, member of school
board at Corrumpa, says in a letter to
Errett), "We certainly congratulate
you upon your success and efforts in.
getting the bill through giving ua
more school." And Rowley is a dem
ocrat. J. M. Moss, another democrat and
member of school board says: "Say,
that 7 months school sounds good to
us out here. We feel under many ob
ligations to you and others for your
untiring efforts in behalf of the poorer,
rural districts. I think that is the
greatest blessing that could fall to our
lot." ' . ..
Miss Nora Connell, one of Union
county's best teachers says:
' "Mr. Errett, I must say that my
