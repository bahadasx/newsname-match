Deep Face of Fif tj Per Cent
Ore Creates Excitement
in Town.
The hopes of the fee owners
and lease holders to the lands
adjacent to Baxter Springs were
given a decided boost this week
by developments on the Karl
Ebensteia land lying one mile
west of town
In the second hole so far driven
on this property ore of from 30
to 35 per cent metalic content
was struck at 211 feet and up to
this time at a depth of 235 feet
the drill is still in ore, already
showing a 24 foot face gradually
growing richer, the last samples
showing at least 50 per cent
The drill first ran through a
strata from 165 to 185 feet of
lower per centage dirt. J. T.
Carter is doing the drilling.
Several drill rigs have been
working in the vicinity of Baxter
for p number of weeks and a
number of excellent strikes have
been made, notably on the farms
of L. C. Hocker, and the Hartley
brothers. Each strike inturn
has added grounds for the belief
that eventually and even at no
distant date the mining activity
of the Picher-Carditj distriot
ould work on up to the very
limits of this city. The last
strike has, it would seem, suffi
ciently confirmed that -belief.
Three or four mines close to the
city are now assured within the
coming year, while there is no
reason to doubt that the develop
ment has only just begun.
The News mentions this be
cause of its direct bearing on the
future of. Baxter Springs. It
disproves any theory that the
present prosperity will be short
lived. It is sufficient to satisfy
anyone that Baxter has a big
growth to come soon, and the
character of the men who have
recently invested heavily in city
real estate indicates that men in
the best condition to know the
future are convinced.
The first lease of the Ebenstein
land was taken by J. W. Gran
tham, who sub leased to E. J.
Pratt and associates, a syndicate
of wealthy mining men of Webb
City. Mr. Grantham has about
1,200 acres undr lease and
Grantham & Pratt have seven
drill rigs at work at the present
time.
Other good strikes the past
week, not fully confirmed how
ever, are J. W. Barnes on the L
D. Brewster place adjoining the
Hocker property, and by Youst
Brothers onMbe Jim Barr land
5 1-2 miles west of town on the
Kansas side, and on the Scott
Jarrett place.
A big ore body has been all
but definitely proven on the
Frank Hartly place. All. that
remains is to sink two larger
test holes before beginning a
shaft. For this work a large
Star or Keystone drill will be
secured.
On the Gregg farm, adjoining
the city limits, a drill ran into
ore Wednesday morning. It has
every appearance of being a good
one, judging from the samples
brought into town.
A good strike is reported by
the Thirty-Second Prosecuting
Company, which has been drilling
on the old Mission lease at
Lincolnville. At a depth of 129
feet a rich run of sine blende was
encountered and showed for al
most eight feet. Assays showed
the cuttings to run 18 5 per cent
blende, which is exceedingly rich
for the Lincolnville section of the
field, and the fact that this strike
comes in at a level deeper than
most of the operations at this
camp encourages the members of
the prospecting company in the
belief that they have happened
noon something better than any
thing yet developed in the neigh
borhood. Their lease consists of
40 acres and more drilling will be
done.
Vota for Grant Wag
gonar,of Baxter Springs,
for Representative.

Campbell in Town.
Hon. Phil Campbell, past,
present but not future member'of
congress from this district, paid
his bi-yearly visit to Baxter
Springs Monday afterofoa and
delivered his regulation speech.
With bim came a number of
county candidates hetded by the
drum corps that bas been the
feature thia campaign of tbe Re
publican canvass. The Demo
crats stepped aside, tbe Probibi
tionists were quiet ana only a
Socialist was beard now and
then as if in protest to the usur
pation by their political oppon
ents of the sttention of the public.
It was Republican day in
Baxter, the drum corps made a
heap of noise while the genial
candidate circulated up and down
the street with tbe glad hand of
a schooled politician and a
natural good fellow. The ladies
paraded, fully twodosen of them,
wearing badges .bearing the
words. Women's Republican
Club of Baxter Springs." Hand
bills were freely circulated an
nouncing a speech in the opera
house at 3 o'clock and when
Our Phil" mounted the platform
he was greeted by a crowd of
fully 150 people with men and
women about equally divided.
The ushers too, did their part
well for they cleverly distributed
the people one in every other
seat so that they extended well
to the rear and gave the impres
sion of a full house. At that the
audience was larger than any
other speaker has had here in
the campaign so far. It isn't
much of a year for the campaign
spellbinder.
The speaker had the bearing
and delivery of a veteran politi
cian He was strong on the sob
stuff for the dear "peepul," but
avoided personal abuse. The
tariff was his main theme, but
be told nothing new, just the
some old con talk. A good poli
tician never springs anything
new. He knows his faithful
listeners will tnudge one another
and smile over some sally they
have heard: oft before but he
isn't sure, about how they will
tike a new idea.
Congressman Campbell is clever
and if the people want Hughes
for president they had better vote
for Campbell; but anyone who
votes for Wilson will make a
mistake to vote for Campbell
since he is on record as having
in the past used every means in
his power to obstruct the work
of the present administration.
Dr. J. H. Boswell is the proud
possessor of a new Paige touring
car. Boswell & Byram, owners
of the Motor Inn, have taken the
agency for Baxter and vicinity
for this car, the general agent
for which is the Southern Motor
company of Joplin. C. R. Pen
nington, a salesman for tbe
general agents, has had -the
Paige on exhibition here for
several days and has created a
very favorable impression among
motor owners and prospective
buyers. The Paige is sure a
classy car and is there with the
punch when it comes to power.
She works smoothly and noise
lessly and is very easy riding.

Women Show Active Interest
in National and State
Politics.
The period for registration for
the purpose of voting next Tue
day closed October 27. The regis
tration by wards in the city of
Baxter Springs was as follows:
Women - Men
First ward 139 169
Second ward 186 264
Third ward 97 129
422 562
Total registration 984
Men over women 140
This is the first opportunity
the women of Kansas have had
to vote at a presidential election,
though they have been voting for
city and school officials for many
years. The registration shows a
lively interest in the matter on
the part of. Baxter women, and
the interest here is no greater
than elsewhere in the state. It
introduces a very unknown factor
which may play havoc with some
of the sanguine expectations of
the Hngbes supporters. Women
do not take kindly to warfare,
they know that President Wilson
is striving to maintain peace;
they do not know what Hughes
would do. By his utterances
they have reason to fear a break
with Germany or some other
European nation. So despite the
leaning of their husbands women
are very likely to vote strongly
for Wilson.
Those who neglected to register
have last the opportunity to vote;
that is if they sat around at
home and were too indifferent to
go and have their names recorded.
But those who were out of town
during tbe period for registration
will be permitted to swear in their
votes.
Any who are registered and
are obliged to be away from home
on election day may have a vote
cast for them by tending their
choice of candidates to tbe city
clerk by mail and accompanying
the ticket with an explanation.
This law was recently passed in
this state for the benefit particul
arly of traveling men.
Figuring the population of
Baxter Springs on a basis of two
and a half times the registration
would show about 2,500 people,
which is probably a pretty close
estimate. Multiplying the male
registration by five which is the
ratio usually used would show a
population of 2,610.
JUDGE ELLIS
Has a Word to Say to the
People of Cherokee
County
First: I have been in your
employ now for nearly ten years
and I have my application in tor
continuation.
I have more than 500 cases now
on file in process of settlement
in the Probate Court. How well
they have been attended to I
invite and request you to ask
your neighbor whose estate is
now in court or has been settled
during my administration.
Tbe dependent, neglected and
delinquent child is one of the
progressive questions of this age,
to the solution of which many
people are dedicating their lives.
The problem of saving the de
linquent child of today from
lag a criminal on trial in tbe
district court of tomorrow, and
in this big problem it bas been
and is my endeavor to be one of
the leaders of this movement. I
have spent your time and my
money in attending meetings of
the people who are making a
study of this work. ,
I attended a session in Detroit
and spent three days with juvenile
judges from all of the large
eastern cities, being the only
delegate from west of the Mis
sissippi river who had interest
enough to attend that meeting.
I would like to continue in this
work, not from a financial
standpoint, in fact I could go into
the commercial world and tell
A . . J
my services so inai ii wouia
result in more nt money for me
than there is in this employment
but I do not like to abandon these
children now placed in homes and
