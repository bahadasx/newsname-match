PETROGRAD, Nov. 2.—Field Mar

checked his offensive operations.
Practically everywhere along the
Transylvanian front, excepting south
of Red Tower pass, the Rumanians

WITH THE FRENCH ARMIES ON

French artillerymen, fighting on the
Somme, have developed their barrage
and curtain fire to a wonderful de
cree of perfection. French soldiers
now dash to the assault of German po
sitions under protection of a solid
sheet of artillery fire that often pre

CREW BEING LIONIZED
Captain Koenig Says British Block
ade Is a Joke and German
Navy Is Anxious for
a Fight.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 2.—
Smiling Captain Koenig, skipper of
the green German submarine freight
er Deutschland, confidently thought
today he'd be able to unload his
$10,000,000 cargo without interfer
ence from the United States.
He claimed there was no hiteh
about this, but Collector of Port Mi
Govern of Connecticut evidently
thought different, for he hastened to
Hartford yesterday to confer with
Secretary of the Treasury McVdio,
presumably about the known tewela
anid the stocks alid bonds said to be
aboard. The outcome of this session
had not been made public early to
day.
Sporlflc New London is wider
awake now. than it has been since
the days when the British sneaked
up the channel, captured the foit
atop the Groton hills and slew the
brave American commander.
Captain Koenig and his crew are
cheered every time they appear on
the street. A sixten year old mem
ber of the crew with several sturd/
fellow members narrowly escaped
embraces from a crowd of handsome
women when they appeared on Main
street today. They only edged out
after they'd signed autograph photo
graphs of their boat. The crew hai
shore leave—and they're enjoying it.
The story goes that when the Scott
tu£ greeted The Deutschland and in
quired if it wanted a tow, a voice
from aboard the submarine answered,
"No, we want beer."
Captain Koenig's talk with news
paper men left the impression that
anti-American feeling is still rather
strong in Germany, though he hesi
tatingly said "wasn't very bad."
He scoffs at the British blockade.
"It's only a spy system, a chain
of commercial agents," he said, "and
if the British navy comes out. why
we'll be ready for them, though,
frankly, we can't catch up to Eng
land's naval strength during ho
war."
Germany thinks the war will .ast
at least another year and is confi
dent of the outcome.
"The submarine is the vessel of
the future. Battleships are no good
any more and anybody who doesnt
see that must wear blinders. I think
the United States is beginning to
realize it."
Quite a Good Plan.

injunction is asked.
Tho plaintiffs operate twenty-four
mines in Indiana with an aggregate
daily productive capacity of 27,000
tons and require 1,500 care daily,
they state. But because of lack of
cars, mines are kept idle and in the
