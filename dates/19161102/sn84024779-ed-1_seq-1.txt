"THE OTHER MAN'S WIPE"
The eternal triangle, the man,
the wife and the other man, or the
wife, the husband aid other wo
man, this is the basis for all
stories and naturally is as old as
time. To treat this age old bas
is principle in a new or clever
manner "is a consummation de
voutly to be wished" and in "The
Other Man's Wife" the new Gask
ell & Mac Vitty play a new treat
ment of this old theme is to be
found.
The play is from the pen' of
Victor E. Lambert, and* abounds
in a succession of clever situa
tions. The comedv scenes are
numerous and the press has been
most flattering in what they have
had to say about the play.
"The Other Mail's Wife will be
seen at the Wahpetn Opera House
on Wednesday Eeyening, Nov. 8th.
Victor E. Lambert's new play,
"The Other Man's Wife" is
scheduled to appear at the Wali
p«t (hi Opera House, Wednesday,
Nov. 8th. The story of the play
is the double standard of morals
imposed upon the world by man.
The acts of the man are condoned
and excused and apologized for
while the same actions in women
are condemed an no excuse made
or accepted. Mr. Lambert has
taken tin? time old theme and wov
en into it a most fascinating story.
The producers Gaskell & Mac Vitly
have given the play the best cast
posible and a sumptuous scenic
investure.
8. R. VAN 8ANT TRIBUTE
TO PRES. WILSON
Delivered June 22nd, 1915, at the
Wilson Day Celebration
The United States has ever been
fortunate in having the right man
for every emergency.
Washington for the Revolution
Jefferson to pen the immortal
Declaration of Independ'e-ice,
Hamilton to plead for the consti
tution, Jackson to destroy nulifl
cation, Lincoln to perserve the
Union and now when a world war
is raging, the man of the hour is
Wood row Wilson.
No man ever had a more diffi
cult task to perform. No citizen
ever needed the support of every
citizen of the republic than he.
While desiring peace, he has
stood for the right of the Ameri
can people. It takes
a
man of
courage to do this for it may lead
to war.
We have reason lo be proud of
our president. What man stands
ifirst before tho world? Is it Eng
land's king. Germany's kaiser,
Russia's czar or Austria's emper-l
or? No! It is the president of
the United States.
Let us. every one of us, stand
by him. He is fighting our bat
tles. He is entitled to our sup
port.
As it is. we have ',8 states and I
1000.000.000 pepole, every, state
and every man loyally supporting
the president of the United Slates,:
determined to follow where he
leads, having faith in his wisdom,!
patriotism and statesmanship.

WOODR0W WILSON
President of the United States
tsr-ias--.
'A
"HE HAS KEPT US OUT OF WAR"
This is the face of a man strong, courageous,
patient ami kindly, a man—
Always alert to the aspfafettn* of his fellow
man and sympathetic toward their fulfillment
Never complacent toward the encroachments
of privilege nor tolerant of social wrong
Always seeking to enhance the dignity of
labor and better the state of the toiler
Never lending an ear to the sophistry of ex
ploitation or the blandishments of expediency
Always patient to hear and weigh, to ap
praise and analyze, and passionate to find the
way of right
Never premature in purpose nor prejudiced
in judgment, and never headlong in decision
Such is WOODROW WILSON.

WHAT ELSE CAN ONE DO?
Sir: Senator Walsh writes
that "year after year this same
United Stales senator had given
its seal of approval to men whom
every member of that body knew
was no more nor less than the
plain tool of some special inter
est." After reading this sentence
by Wilson's western manager, in
which the word "whom" is mis
used, a singular verb used instead
of a plural and a double negative
employed I decided that I would
vote for Hughes. Do you blamn
me?.—Minneapolis Journal.
