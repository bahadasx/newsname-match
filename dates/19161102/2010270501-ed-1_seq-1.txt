ARRESTED CLAIMS
IT IS ALL A MISTAKE
J. Carr, alias Arthur Carr. arrest
ed by Officer Wheeler the last of the
week and wanted by the authorities
t Miles City. Mont., was returned to
Miles City Saturday. A deputy sher
iff arrived in Alliance Saturday from
Miles City and returnod with carr.
Carr," who is a rallroaa man, was

national government. The state and
federal department will continue to
pay $1,200 per year toward the sup
port of the county agent work in
Box Butte county ana me naiauce

county ana by subscription.
To Present I'ctition
If you believe that county agent
work should be coutlnued in Box
Butte county and supported by an
rather than a few, you are asked to
Sinn the petition which will be pre
sented to you In a short time.
Some UeiioUtj lerivel
The following are some of the ben
efits to the people of Box Butte

It Is expected that fully 1,000 per
sons will see tho AUlance-Chadron
football game at the fair grounds
here Friday afternoon. The busl
ness and professional men have co
operated with the schools in nn ef
fort to get the crowd out. with tin
result that 4 00 tickets at 25 cents
each have been sold to the business
men of Alliance for this game. Of
ficer Wheeler pulcld tho stunt, and
to him great credit is due for en
thusiasm shown In co-operating.
At Hot Springs last Friday they
had some crowd out, the Alliance
hunch who went up claiming the
whole town was there. And such
cheering and yelling and encourage
ment! It Is a safe hot that the local
team can't work and play the game
against odds, winning most of them,
all for the pleasure of digging down
and paying their own expenses. So
the bunch who accompanied the boys
to the Springs decided that Alliance
should wake up, and the old town
has answered.
The school children will all be out.
A parade of school children will
form at the school house about 2:30
in the afternoon and will follow the
band down Box Butte avenue to
Second street, returning up Box
Butte to Fifth, then down Fifth to
the fair grounds.
The game on Friday should be a
regular battle. With a thousand
voices to cheer the team on to vic
tory. Alliance should not only win
nother game but put added vim and
enthusiasm In high school athletics.
The long expected volunteer flro-
men's "duck smoker" was given at
the department club rooms at 8
o'clock Tuesday evening, when near
ly seventy of the Alliance volunteer
firemen and their guests devoured
fifty roast wild ducks, with cranber
ry sauce, hot sweet potatoes, steam
ing hot coffee and other rtlmmin's
that made this feast one of the most
delicious and unique ever held In the
city.
Following the hour spent in eat
ing, a program of unusual Interest
was given. Lloyd Thomas filled the
position of toastmaster to say "fill
ed the place" is correct now, as
Lloyd Is getting fatter every day and
after devouring a big roast duck he
filled the place, without trouble. Mu
sic was beautifully and soulfully
rendered from time to time by the
double quartet, composed of firemen.
Outside of the desire of a few mem
bers of tho quartet to quack once In
a while they did even better than
some famous singers have done.
It is Impossible here to give the
speeches that were delivered or the
stories that were told, but when you
read tho following list of speakers

Tuesday night was Hallowe'en
Bunches of boys and girls were seen
here and there, running, snickering,
yelling and all making a concerted
effort to do something.
The local police had provided
against any emergency and besides
having Chief Jeffers aud Officer
Wheeler on the Job, rive extra men
were detailed to .watch proceedings.
A motor truck was put into play and
some sixty of the younger generation
of the city given a Joy ride to the
station, at various times during the
evening.
Taken all in all. hallowe'en was
quiet. No damage was done save to
the usual Innumerable outhouses
No comnlalnts were received. The
auto truck brought in several differ
ent tribes of hallowe'enites. They
were detained In tbe front room at
the notice station for a couple of
hours and then allowed to go home
Mayor Romlg gave the youngsters a
talking to, telling them to have all
tbe fun they could but to be careful
and not destroy property.
Tbe football team was out full
force Intent on pulling a scorcher.
but the big hand of tbe law came
down on them and they rode In the
wason. At the station they were
turned Into the cooler and left there
to meditate for some two hours,
when they all promised to be good
and go home. They were turned
out and went home to the tune, "We
didn't get home until morning."
No trouble was experienced after
11 o'clock and but very little all ev
ening, owing to the fact that the of
ficers kept after them so persistent
ently that the boys and girls were
afraid to go even a little beyond the
limit. Considerable soap was used
on windows both down town and In
the resident section. Tick-tacks and
other apparatus were used to a great
extent.

THAT IT t'AX IIANDLIC
After putting up a stiff battle, the
Alliance high school football eleven
lost the game played at Hot Springs
Friday to the Hot Springs team by a
score of 6 to 0. 'Ihe local boys
seemed unable to get to work light
at the start and It was during tbe
hrst three minutes of play that the
name was lost.
On the toss the Hot springs team
was fortunate and chose the Bouth
uoal where they had the advantage
of a down-hill run. Before the home
boys knew what had hapened the
enemy had made a touch down. How
ever, they did not make good at the
goal. Then realizmg what had trans
pired the Alliance bunch iignteneo
un and nut up a pretty scrap. Suc
cessful forward passes were worked
by both elevens. Sensational end
runs by Lotspeich were tne oruer oi
the day, as In the game played here
the preceding Friday, uutier anu
Fenning found It an easy matter to
Ket away. While the Alliance boys
played great ball after the Brst three
minutes of the game tney couiu not
get near enough to the goal through
out the balance of tne game.
Owing to the failure of Captain
Davenport to return from Omaha In
time. Fenning acted as captain. This
broke up the back formation in tne
field and considerably weakened the
defense. Edwards, who was Injured
the week previous, was compelled to
go In and play end while Butler took
Ralls' olace as full. These ana oin
er changes together with the bard
trio there, were bound to make a an
ference. Donovan was taken out
near the end of tbe game, injured,
which made another change in tbe
line. Hot Springs made a grand to
tal of 161 yards during the game
while Alliance made ISC.
Tbe C. B. Q. is enjoying tb t
