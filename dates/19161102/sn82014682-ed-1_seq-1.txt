REFUSES BIRTH
Thayer, Holds Back Papers on
Learning Boy is to Live
"in Japan
Because the father of yttle Shizo
Kiyuna, a three-year ' old Hawaiian
born Japanese lad, stated that he is
sending the. boy back to grow, up in
Japan and learn Japanese ways and
customs. Wade Warren Thayer .re
fused today to grant a birth certificate
from the office of secretary of the
territory. "-;.
Thayer says tliat if he case comes
to a lawsuit in the efforts of the pan
ents to secure the certificate for their
child that he is willing to see the mt-4
ter threshed out In the Courts. He
believes that the stand he has taken
in the matter is right, and if little
Shizo sails toward Japan this after
noon on the Persia Maru with his
mother as Intended, the family will
hold no papers stating that the little
fellow was born in Hawaii.
Shizo's father is Kamado Kiyuna, a
laborer on one of the island planta
tions. He brought the boy this morn-1
ing to tne secretary a ornce w itn wii
nesses to show that the lad is a na
tive of the territory. -The father stat
ed, that he. was sending his wife and
two children to Japan on the Persia
to see the children's grandfather. Sec
retary Thayer inquired how long the
visit from the little son was to last.
- "The grandfatner Is anxious to see
these children,", responded the elder
Kiyuna, "and Shizo shall stay for 15
years. I, -too, would rather have him
stay In Japan until he is quite old."
Kiyuna spoke through an interpre
ter, explaining. further that he wishes
his son's- boyhood training to be in the
land of the chrysanthemum.
"Here is a case where the father
comes right out and says he wants
his son . educated '. in Japan though
born ' In ' America," . says Secretary
Thayer, "and my. observations are
that he will be a pretty! poor American
if he comes back here at the age of
18 years.' '
Kalakaua avenue will be sent out at
the same time - and the HO days' limit
also applies to ; residents along that
street. '

Political Ethics
Thrown
Forward
G. 0, P. Says Will Foot Bill if
Bourbons Send Stenographer
to Attend Meetings
Is it a breach of ethics for one po
litical party to have a stenographer
at a meeting of the rival party to take
down the speeches of the candidates?
Is it more unethical for 5uch party to I
. . . . i
iukkc use ui iiiese spvecnes to secure
the misstatements and misreiresenla
Itions of unscrunuloua Or careless po
ilit'cal speakers? i "
These two questions have been
thrown to the fore in these last days
f the campaign. The Democrats are
indignant and hitter for the fact that
tne. Republicans have taken shorthand
reports of the Democratic meetings
and have thus succeeded in correcting
and overcoming alleged false and mis
leading statements. - '
M. C. Pacheco, candidate for tho
senate on the Democratic ticket, and
K. H. F. Wolter,' candidate for the
house on the paree ticket, are especlaV
ly Indignant over the Reoubllcan par
ty's strategy; and one visiting n Dem
ocratic meeting there nlabt3 Is sure
to hear them "burning up" the Repubt
Means and condemning the stenograph
ic reporter. - - ;
When the Republicans first heard
that the Democrats were making wild
statements about the frontage tax, the
Panid Transit franchise and other
things Which have come,more or less
or an issue or a subject of discussion
n the campaign, thev decided fo have
a stenographer at these meetings so
ps to pin the Pauahl street orators ; to
their words.-" - ' - - '
At the meeting of tfe Democrats
last night the speakers took particular
pains , to (lay, -the Renuhllcah??- and
6trbngly Intimated that It' wasboth.
unethical' and unbrotherly of them' to
take transcripts of their meetings.1 So
today a nice point in political ethics
has rrlsen as shown in the foregoing i
questions. ' ' v - v . ,)
. Robert, W. Brekons. national ;com
mitteeman,; In answering- the ques
tions', says that if the Democrats will
have a-stenographer prf sent at the!

the speakers say, the Republican com
mittee', Will foot the bill for, the sten

WASHINGTON, D. O, Nov. 2. Secretary of State Lansing,. In a decla
ration today on American. policy and understanding of German pledges, indi
cates that the United States will hold Germany accountable if th steamer
Marina was sunk without warning, even though she carried a cannon. .
Reports that the Marina had a 4.7-inch in mounted astern brought to
the head of the state department several questions today by Interviewers.
Lansing replied that he understands that Germany's pledge not to sink
merchant vessels without warning, and without providing for the safety of
passengers and crew, apply to ships wth defensive armamant as well a
those totally unarmed. .. ' ' , ' .
He declared that in correspondence between the state department and
th German foreign effice there was no distinction drawn between armed :
and unarmed ships, so. long as they were obviously merchant vessels.
: , . He further declared that the stats department will not accept any con
tention that Germany's responsibility is limited to safeguarding pauen-Cers-and
crews of vessels without armament. -
It Is thought possible that Germany might use the Marina case to set
tle this issue of attack cn a merchant thip defensively armed. ; ;
