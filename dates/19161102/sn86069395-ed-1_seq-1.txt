ordered tle'L. & N. to build a bigger

Let every Democrat go to the polls

Col. George Harvey, one of Presi

salooas at midnight last night. Al
though a largo part of the old doinin

local ontion elections, the new state
law closed more than 800 saloons,
mostly in Richmond, Norfolk, New
port News, Lynchburg, Petersburg,
Roanoke and Bristol.
- The law is one of the most drastic
ever passed by -a state legislature. No
beverage except cider can be sold
that 'shows a trace of alcohol and pos
session of more than one gallon of
whisky, one gaHon of wine, or three
gallons of beer would be regarded as
prima facie evidence of intent to vio
late the law. This provision prob
ably will receive an early test in
court, as vast quantities of liquor have
been stored in private homes.
Along with the prohibition measure
and to insure its enforcement, the leg

Efforts To Get More
Teams.
About fifty teams on tne road be

gaged in building a gravel road from
the Tennessee line to Lafayette, to
connect with the pike to Ciarksville,
quit work Monday on a strike. The
teams had been hauling gravel from
the creek below Lafayette at $1.25 a
yard and as the haul was shortened
the price was cut to $1. This caused
the trouble and some of the teamsters
demanded as high as $1.50. The
strike leaders forced all wagons to
stop. "
the strike had not been adjusted
yesterday. A further complication
has arisen by the refusal of the owner
of the gravel pit to let any more gray
el be taken at the proposed price of
$1. The work is being done under
the direction of Esq. Rogers and an
effort is being made to get gravel else
where and resume business with a
new set of teams.

PRESIDENT ORDERS
INQUIRY RUSHED
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 31. Af
ter receiving unofficial information
that six Americans had lost their lives
by the sinking of the British steam
ship Marina, President Wilson com
municated with Secretary Lansing to
night and directed all possible haste
be taken in obtaining the facts con
cerning the sinking of the vessel.
Secretary Lansing informed the
president that in addition to asking
the American embassy in London for
information, informal inquiries had
been sent to the German government.
While it was made clear here that
jxo action would be taken pending the
collection of all the facts, it was indi-
jcated that the view was taken that the
situations contained grave possibili
ties. GERMANY EMBASSY CALM.

lieve the evidence will show the
pledges given to the United States
have been violated. It is said at the
embassy, however, that if a com
mander of a submarine has violated
or exceeded his orders, his action
would be met promptly with severe
punishment. Officials of the embas
sy feel that Consul Frost's dispatch
saying the Marina had been shelled,
indicated that the vessel was trying to
escape.
