For the
Slighter Figure
M PETITE figure and retrained
lines add immensely to the dress,
problem of many a woman. In this store
we take no small pride in the unerring ease
with which we supply a flawless fit for this
type of physique a fit that sacrifices not
a whit of style's newest exactions.
Our Junior coat and suit models cover an
extremely wide range of size and style and
we have yet to find the figure too dainty
for us to apparel correctly to the finest
shade of fit and fashion.

untrue. Ask the county judge. Sec
ond: As to tho Ciiry case. It was a
matter of common knowledge thuti
the confession was ruled out. because
the olllcers made him promises before
I was county attorney. Thiid: As to
extra mill levy In 1015. It was n mere
ovut sight. I'.vcry commissioner as
well as myself knew that there could
not lie it It) mill levy. Nor did I so
advise the board, nor is the board to
blame, nor has the county paid any
thing to correct same. Fourth: As
to the bootlegging cases. Criticism !
is mado as to the Hue assessed. Suf-
fice to suv that about S380.OO was paid
the county by bootleggers, llesltles .

expensive trials at county expense? ,
Of the :.r complaints filed by me the j

rest were all lined, jailed, sout to the .
penitentiary or puroled, and 'about
ititiO.OO iu linos and costs have been ,
