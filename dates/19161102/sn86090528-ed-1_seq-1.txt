Said to Be Under Bond for Same
Offense at Pauls Valley

and the Hub, Morgan & Grlbi and oth
er houses wcro victimized in the ag
gregate to the extent of over $100, the
chocks bolng returned to them as be
ing utterly worthless.
The woman skipped town fmmedi
atoly upon receiving the money and
went to Texas where she spent sever
al weeks. Seeking to find comfort at
home she went to Purcell, near which
ior-n Colo uor nicthw- resides on i
farm. Sheriff Bailey, being advised
that the woman had reached that part
of the state, asked the . city marshal
to locate and hold her. The woman
was found there at 4 o'clock yesterday
morning and arrested at a hotol where
she had gone upon reaching town the
night before with her baby and entire
ly without funds.
She was guarded at the hotel pend
ing the arrival of Undersherift Ruck
er, who left for her yesterday arriving
here last night. j
While in custody at Purcell the wo
man, who is but twenty years old and
a deserted wife, is said to have told
the officers at that place that she was
under bond on the same charge at
Pauls Valley, not, however, admitting
her guilt. ,
Mrs. Clark is the victim of an un
fortunate, marrifge. Her mother and
11-yoar-old brother living on a rented
farm at Cole, are her only relatives.
About a year ago she married a man
nnu jjjuveu tu in? wmmiuBtt uiiu way
left her several months ago to take
care of her baby.

who passed the checks at one of the
stores here.
Although occupying an upstairs cell
at night Mrs. Clark is permitted the
freedom of the jailor's quarters durinj

She is hopeful of furnishing bond.
Mrs. Clark denied her guilt in the
Chickasha charges and waived exami

The 310 Drivers Owning Licenses Need
Not Worry Over Amendment Passed
by Council Tuesday Night
DRIVER'S PERMIT
LAW AN OLD ONE
Ordinance Was Passed in 1910 But lis
Enforcement is Now Undertaken by
City Administration -
TWO PERTINENT FACTS
The ordinanco requiring auto-
mobile driver to have licenses
i ix years old. '
Before the amendment was
passed Thursday nlflht 310 per-
ont In Chickasha had already
obtained their licenses.
"Many peopie in Chickasha are un
der a wrong impression regarding the
amendment to the old muto- vehicle
ordinance which was passed at last
Thursday's meeting of the city coun
cil requiring all drivers of cars in
Chickasha to liwn a driver's license,"
Baid Mayor Coffman today. "This is
an old law. The bill requiring such
permit and license was passed by the
city council In 1H10 and some people
have been driving cars In Chickasha
for three and four years without a li
cense not knowing or pretending not
to know that they were subject to a
fiue every day that they took the car
out without a license. ,-
1 "The action of last. Thursday was
simply an amendment to the old law
and "also the approval of the examin
ing board which I appointed to take
tho place of the old board. ThiB old
hoard was appointed several years ago
but had not been at work for a long
while because the law had not been
enforced and their services were not
required.
"The same is the case with the age
limit. Tho law forbidding persons un
der sixteen years to operate a machine
has been effective for several years
but has not heeu enforced. What is
tbo UNO of having those laws on the
statute books, if they are not to be
obeyed by the public with, punish
ment for violations? It they are not
good laws they should be repealed.
"Another point on which many peo
ple are in error," continued his honor,
is the belief that the 310 persons who
obtained licenses under the old law
and before the passage of the amend
ment last Thursday required to pass
an examination and to get a new li
cense. That is not correct. It Is only
doing justice to these 310 people who
have already obeyed the law to require
otter owners and drivers to do tho
sano. Those having licenses have al
ready complied with the law and have
nothing else to do." .
"Curly"' Reynolds, city clerk, Is issu
ing an average of twenty-five applica
tion daily to drivers and owners who
wish to escape the penalty attached to
operating motor vehicles within the
city limits without a driver's license.
"There is plenty of howling going
on among these applicants," said the
city clerk. "They object to paying the
seventy-five cents examination fee and
some of them are under the Impression
that they must pay a fee of seventy
five cents to every member of the ex
amining board. Many others are un
der the impression that Mayor Coff
man passed this law and are jumping
on him with both feet. I explain to
them that this is an old ordinance now
being enforced. Some people want a
license without a drivers permit but
this cannot be issued. The license
will only be issued with a correspond
ing permit showing that the applicant
is capable of driving"
The work of the auto examiners re
quires about twenty minutes. In soma
cases all that the members do is to
sign the application having knowledge
that the applicant is capable from see
ing him or her driving for several
years. As the examiners are garage
men and automobile men they have
had ample opportunity t judge of th
