TIE ONLY REMEDY
For Republicans in large num
bers to vote for Democrats is an
extraordinary thing.
But an extraordinary situation
confronts us.
And extraordinary ills require
extraordinary remedies.
If we vote the ticket presented
to us under the name Republi
can, we will be voting for every
thing that is un-Republican.
It will be regarded as endors
ing these things:
Turning men fairly elected out
of office.
Saddling unequal tax laws on
the people, whereby some of the
wealthy and the special interests
escape their just share of taxa-j
tion, and the share which they
escape must be put up by the
"common herd."
Loading the taxpayers with ex
horbitant salaries, state and
county, to the end that an office
holding oligarchy be created,
with money enough wrested from
the people to enable them to fi
nance costly campaigns.
Gag rule in running legisla
tures. Gag rule, and the utter ignor
ing of the will and rights of the
voters in conventions.
The nomination of notoriously
unfit candidates because they
stand in with and will support
:.theg8iflt..:-y. . t ...
The attetnpted intimidation of
newspapers by libnl suits and the
threat of libel suits.
The absolute suppression of
minority ngliia.
Trafficking in office and the
emoluments of office for the per
petuation of political power.
Neglecting to make needed
laws for thi benefit and pro
tection of the people.
Not only wi!l n vote for the
Republican ticket !:e regarded as
an endorsement of these things
and miny more like them, but it
will be construed as a license to
continue with that sort of thing.
What voter who is not an
aspirant for office or a beneficiary
of the gang's operations will
dare nay he is in favor of such
things?
Not one.
Not h?ir. in favor of them,
how can you justify yourself in
voting to endorse'and pe;petuate
them?
You know perfectly well that
there is no hope whatever of
ever being able to change the
practices of the so-called Repub
lican party of New Mexico and
the counties of the state by ae
tion within the party, as long as
that party and the class of men
who at present control it have a
hold on office.
It has been tried by different
men, but nobody ever got any
where with the effort
There is but one thing to do.
Smash the bosses jar the
barnacles loose by voting for the
Democrats.
When every boss, big and lit
tie every beneficiary of gag and
cana rule is separated from office
then and not till then will there
be hope- of reforming the Re
publican party.
THE MINE TAX LAW
Perhaps some of our readers
donot fully understand the al
lusion in this paper last week to
the mine tax law.
This law is a fine example of
what the Republicans have been
doing to the people of this state
It is known as the Springer-
Hawkins law, because Charles
Springer and W. A. Hawkins
framed the law.
Charles Springer is treasurer
of the Rocky Mountain & Pacific
Co. of Colfax county, the largest
coal producer in New Mexico.
W. A. Hawkins is general
counsel for the El Paso South
western Railroad Co., and con
sulting counsel for the Stag
Canyon Fuel Co., of Colfax coun
ty, the second largest coal pro
ducer in New Mexico.
Under this law the mines are
taxed on the output, and not on
the value of the property.
In 1915 Mr. Springer's com
pany reported to financial journ
als and stockholders asseti of
$19,000,000.00, which supposedly
represents the actual value of the
property it owns.
It was assessed under the
Springer-Hawkins law at $2,843,
002.00, less than one-sixth of its
value.
13 there a man in Torrance
county who got his property in at
one-sixth of its value?
If there is we would like to
hear from him.
Such things as the above are
what really concern the voter,
and it is an organization that is
responsible for them the Repub
lican party.
There were good men in the
legislature that passed that law,
who protested, but they were
oVer-ruled.- -- -.
There were good men in all the
legislatures which passed all the
unjust and unfair laws who pro
tested against them, but were
over-ruled and put down.
It will be remembered that E.
Davies protested against the
county salary law, but it had no
effect.
Just so, no man's protest has
any effect.
As before said in this paper,
there are good men on the Re
publican tickets and in the Re
publican ranks.
But they don't have any effect.
It's the same old machine.
There is but one remedy-
smash the machine.
FATAL MCIDENT
Samuel Burnett Keen, son of
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Keen, died
Sunday evening about ten
o'clock.
Funeral services were held at
the home of Clay Keen in Es
tancia, and the remains were
sent to the former home in Tex
as for burial.
Death was due to an accident
which happened near Mcintosh
Sunday morning
The boy was riding a bucking
horse, and was finally thrown,
striking on his head and the
horse falling on him. He was
rushed to town where medical
aid was given, but it was found
that there was a fracture of the
skull at the base of the brain,
causing a blood clot, and death
ensued in about twelve hours
after the accident.
Deceased was born July 30,
1900, and was therefore a little
past sixteen years of age.
He was an unusually intelli
gent, bright boy. and his death
is a severe trial to his parents,
who have the warm sympathy of
the community.
The family came here from!
Texas last spring.
parasite, the professional politi
cian, makes a livelihood at the
expense of the tax payers. This
fact is admitted by all except
those who are dishonestly self
seeking. Like the saloon, there
are so many ways to exercise the
good there is in it that it is al
together bad.
Perhaps at the risk of being
charged with reiteration, I want
to say that in the consideration
of the two essential things in
life, politics and religion, we use
less common sense than in the
consideration of anything else.
In the conduct of public business
our methods are several decades
behind the times and our taxes
are more than double what they
should be. More than two years
ago I proposed to conduct the
business of Torrance county for
one half what it was coating and
to do it better than it had ever
been done or could be done under
the present antiquated methods.
That proposition was made in
good faith and still holds good.
The same conditions that make
it possible tor me to do this in
Torrance county prevail in every I
county in the United States and
extends to every state govern
ment and to that at Washington.
The public mind moves slowly
but some real thinking in this
direction will result ultimately in
a reduction of the high cost of
government, and it is the onlv
thing that will do it. Think it
over. John W. Corbett.

The large type editorial in your

abuse of political parties rings
true. Permit me to congratulate
