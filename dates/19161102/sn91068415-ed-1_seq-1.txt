t- There have been several . fires re
cently of mysterious " origin but it is
now thought the secret has been re
vealed with the apprehension of 12-year-dld
Georgia Long, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Long, who seems
to have a mania for setting fire to
houses. The nTtle girl is irrespon
sible, having been under the care of
a physician for sometime. She was
returned to her parents with the un
derstanding that they maintain a
closer watch over her. Notwith
standing the city has .suffered some
loss through these fires and the
property owners no little damage,
they are not .' inclined -to push the
matter. The little girl is the da iel -
ter of Assistant Fire Chief Long and
it is an unfortunate affair which
has the sympathy of the people.
Tuesday morning fire was dis
cove.'ed in four rooms and bath
room in the second story of the M.
R. Stout home on Rankin street.
Mrs. Stout saw the little girl in the
halLat the time the fire started and
Chief' Ingram and City Manager

Monday and windo w curtains' were
destroyed before the fire was extin

same section and .the Long child
was seen to Jeave the house.

because there can be no censure, the

MAN -TERRIBLY WOUNDED
While enroute to Greensboro Sun
day afternoon the editor passed a
man in the road who looked more
dead than alive. He came out of
the woods near the convict camp
beyond Jamestown and a gentleman
from the camp was approaching him
at the time. His head was covered
with blood which was streaming
down his heck. Evidently the man
had received a terrible blow on the
head. Returning we stopped at the
camp and called the same man who
met the wounded man in the road a
few hours before. He seemed re
luctant to come out and when he
finally did evaded every question

the man and remarked "his name I
was' but here he looked around
and perhaps got suspicious and said
"I don't know who he was". "How
did he get hurt we asked"? No
answer, and the man walked away.
Of course he knew about the affair
but as he refused to impart the least
information concerning it we are at
a loss to understand. The matter
should be investigated.
A Creamery for High Point
I by All Means
In concjg jvitb the movement
tajestablUh i eamefy--toute into
Anderson, county demonstrator, will
beecured to help work up interest
among the farmers towards securing
the required number of cows to
furnish the cream so as to ensure a
creamery in High Point. It is , un
derstood that just as soon as the
milk from 400 cows is assured that
the creamery will be established. It
looks like the required number of
cows can be secured in a radius of
ten miles of High Point and then it
would be easy for the promoters of
the enterprise to daily collect the
cream or for the .people to bring it
to the city two or three times a week,
just as is the case with scores of
creamery roiites scattered through
out the country.
Cream has been bringing 32c a
pound and the skimmed milk can
also be sold at a profit, fed to the
calves and hogs or made into cheeseTpVhether this will succeed or not
all of which is money to the dairy
man.
A creamery route places the
farmer in as good position as the lo
cal dairyman who gets lc a quart
for his milk unskimmed. Figuring
the cream at 32c alb. and the value
of the skimmed milk to the farmer
or to the creamery and it is about
10c per quart for the milk straight.
We wore recently on the Pilot
'mountain creamery route where an
aunt of the writer hastwelve cowspa
cream separator and cheese mould
ed. The cream is sold at a good
price, the skimmed milk made into
cheese and fed to the hogs and thers
is no waste. A man comes around
twice a week and collects the cream,
eggs and other products, paying the
highest market price for same. It
has worked a revelation to these
people.
Take Lincoln and Catawba coun
ties, the pioneer counties in the
movement. Farmers who had a
hard time keeping the wolf from the
door or now independent and have
neat bank accounts. And witness
the change in .cattle, from the old
field scrub cow to the very finest
stock that give an abundance of
milk. -
North Carolina is awahening fast
to the importance of better farming,
better dairying and the allied trades
and it bodes .well for her in con
nection with good roads, schools,
rural delivery, etc. Let the good
work continue -.

Faces Trial for Larcency of
Automobile and Clothing
-Jl ,250.00 Bond Over
His Head
Chief of Police Gray and Joe W.
Tomlinson arrived last week from
Reading, Pa., with Clay Moore and
Mrs. J. R. Reitzel's car, announce
ment being made in last week's Re
view of same.
Something like $200.00 worth of
clothing was also brought back by
Chief Gray, identified as the proper
ty of N. H. Silver, a South Main4
street merchant.
For the theft of the auto Moore
was placed under a $1,000.00 bond
at the trial Thursday and for the
theft of the clothing the trial was
held Friday and an'additional bond
of $250.00- required which were
given and the young man given his
liberty until superior court.
Chief Gray says Moore confessed
to the whole affair. He took the ,
car of Mrs. Reitzel about three
o'clock Sunday morning following
day night. Moore arrived in Dan
ville about six o'clock that Sunday
morning and by Sunday night he .
had reached Harrisburg.Ta., a dis
tance of 500 miles. In Lebanon,
Pa., Moore traded the light six Buick,
e PPerty of Mrs. Reitzel for a
faonroe roauswr
and $125.00 to
boot. When he wasa 3ted he
still had $40.00 of thisvamjr . and
most of the clothing appropriated
from Silver's' store. The tflwas
damaged very little from th0 long
ride, being necessary to buy three
tires to complete the journey which
was made without mishap, except
rough toads part of the way. Tne
party left Reading, Pa., Sunday af-
ternoon at 5 o'clock and reached
High Point Wednesday evening, ' a
distance of 700 miles.
Moore said that he concealed him
self irr Silver's1 store Thursday
night and after the proprietor had
r iockccf jne- aors ..proceeaea io; taKe
wnat gqoas ne waotea ana juoging
from the articles taken he was some
sport on his trip. - He left the roads
ter he had traded for in a garage at
Reading Pa., with instructions to
sell. A detective of that city made
the arrest and exchange of cars,
leaving the Lebanon citizen minus
of $85.00 (the difference between
$125.00 and $40.00 in possession of
Moore and which was returned, to
him) but a wiser man. The detec
tive received the reward of $100.00
offered arid $10.00 for the delivery
of Silver's merchandise. This with
the costs in the case makes the de
livery of Moore and car cost in the
neighborhood of $250.00.
There is some sympathy express
