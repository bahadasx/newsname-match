the lover floor of the auditorium
and a oart of the balcony and when
Ii arcr to speak he was given an

Mr. Ilarnhnrt criticized Candidate

legislation that was admittedly
beneficial to the nation as a whole.
tie pointed out that this Is a re
markable campaign, because there
has been no wabblo In business. The
speaker said that the high tariff
party usually succeeds In causing
hard times just before an election,
but this time it was not even tried,
because the democratic party had
established the fact that it la not
the party that causes panlcn.
In discussing the criticism of the
president Congressman Barnhart
said that Wilson had been berated
for wabbling. The speaker eaid
that Jf Wilson had ever wabbled, he
had wabbled right and that was all
anybody could ask. He told of how
many bills were passed without roll
call, because the republican con
gressmen knew that the people back
home wanted them, but at the same
time they were afraid to go on rec
ord as Laving lined up with the
noerats.
The speaker said that after the
tariff had been revised it was found
that not enough revenue was being
secured. He stated that the tariff
had been taken off the necessities
of life and placed upon silks and
other expensive goods. To make
up the shortage In revenue the In
come tax w as passed, he said.
"The republicans once tried to
pass an income tax law, but It wasn't
successful. Jim Wutson and Joe
Cannon were in favor of It and
whenever I seo them w-urking for
anything the peoplo want I get sus
picious. I want to fcay that If you
people of Indiana put Jim Watson,
Jim Goodrich and Jim llemenway
ir.to power In this state you're colng
to have the political Jim-Jams In
three years or I am no prophet."
In discussing the Incuine tax law
O-on cress man IJamh.". rt told of a
conference held between Pre.Vt Wil
son and several tinanciers of the
ountry in regard to the law. He
said J hat the moneyed men told
Wilson that If the Income tax law
were passed they would cause a
panic. Congressman 1 Urnhart
stated that Wilson told them that if
any person tried to cause u panic
while he was president be would
bang him as a traitor and cause his
name to go down In history In dis
repute. lAplains Ranking; Law.

shewing how loth the tankt r and

that Hughes as governor of New

Vollmer, Father of Embargo
Resolution is Out For Wilson
In Statement Says Hughes'
Supporters Show They
Are Not Neutral.
Nw--TImc Special Service:
DAY F.N PO KT. In., Nov. 2. For
mer Congressman Henry Vollmer,
who in the 6.1rd congress fathered
the resolution for an embargo on
the shipment of munitions to the
1'uropcan belligerents, today de
clared In an authorized Interview in
the Davenport Democrat in favor of
j the re-election of Pres't Wilson.
Although a lifelong democrat, Mr.
Vollmer was for a time identified
with the so-called German-American
propagandists who bitterly assailed
the president's International policy.
One of the most prominent Amer
icans of German nativity in the
country, Mr. Vollmer wielded a big
influence with Americans of Ger
man birth as well a.--: those of Ger
man descent. In his statement to
day he expressed regret that he flt
compelled to part company wt 1
those who had expressed the hope
that German-Americans should voice
a united protest against the party
in power. "Our first duty," he de
clared, "is to this country and our
political allegiance should be de
cided by the Issues of must concern
to this country. And hence I feel
that it is my duty as an American
citizen and a democrat to cast my
vote for the democratic national
ticket nt the coming election.
"From the time when his name
was first used in connection with the
candidacy for the presidency,
have asked my friends of the na
tional German alliance, the Amer
ican Independence union and the
embargo conferenc what positive
assurance they have, if uny, that
Mr. Hughes would be more truly
neutral us we understand the term,
than Mr. Wilson has been.
"I have watched all of their at
tempts to wecur euch declarations
and I have waited until these, the
closing hcrs of the campaign for
them to ge: something more satis
fying on tht subject, but up to dato

Man Who Robbed

ST. JOSEl'II, .Mich.. Nov. 2.
Frank Ilainey. 4 2 years old. is held
as a bank robber ioday following
his holdup of the Kau Claire vate

He wa.s captured by a posse in a
swamp in which he had taken

'I was a fool. I didn't need the
money."' said Ilainey. who says his
home is in Hillsdale. Mich. '"I went
into the bank to close :; a. business

'whipped out a revolver and held

j All the money was rccoveret
public or prhate, that is more than
a generality except in his speech at
Columhus. O., when he came out
flatly against the embargo and
against' warning Americans to keep
off armed belligerent ships.
"My ( suspicions w ere first raised
In regard to Mr. Hughes when I
perceived the successful efforts of
Georg W. Pci!ins, late financial
partner and political representative
of J. P.' Morgan, agent for munitions
and war loans in the United States
for his Ilrittanic majesty to deliver
the progressive party, hag and bag
gage to Mr. Hushes.
"What is meant by the general
pronouncements of Mr. Hughes for
a stronger foreign polio than that
of Mr. Wilson is made clear and
specific by the emphatic declarations
of Theodore Uoosevelt (who insults
with equal insolence this German
American fellow citizens and the
resident of the United States) Kühn
Hoot (long-time attorney for the
Pritish embassy and tb- interests
of Wall st.). and Heary Cabot
Lodge (the incarnation of our New
Fngland codfish aristocracy), men
who certainly stand closer to Candi
date Hughes than any of the gentle
men of the. aforesaid tllianee union
or conference. One of these three
will in all probability be Mr. Hughes
secretary of state.
"To aid these men to get into
power and to put their emphatically
stated '.octrines into force would, on
the pan. of these German organiza
tions appear to me to ho veritably,
biting off the nose to spite the face."

Strong Precautions Are Taken
at Juarez to Prevent
More Desertions.

Palazar and a strong force of Vil
listas are moving north from Chi-
huahua City today, burning bridges,
ilcstroyinsr railroad trains and loot -
ins trains-, according to information
reaching Juarez.
Strong precautions are being
taken by the Carranza authorities at
Juarez to prevent wholesale deser
tions from the garrison as the Vil-
lislas draw near. An aerage of 10
men have been deserting every
niht for more than a week and
sentinels have been instructed to
lire upon any one seen leaving the
barracks without permission.
Presence of the Villistas north of
Chihuahua gives Villa virtual cor.-
trol of the state, as railroad trattio
has been stopped front all direc
tions. It is believed (len. Trevino
will try to reach Monterey with his
forces when he is compelled to
evacuate. Endues between Sauez
and (lallcgo have been burned down
and five miles of track torn up,
preventing supplies from reaching
Trevino's men. who are badly In

Advices received by mining in

Amidst the tossing billows of the

Now that they are certain that
the Bremen went to the bottom the
crew of the Deutschland decided to- j
day that the most appropriate way I
they could yc farewell honors to
the seamen on their ill-fated sister
submarine would be to hold a
memorial service at sea. Conse
quently it was decided that a laurel
wreath, bound with the Herman
naval ensign, should be cast upon
the waters while prayers were said.
It was first suggested that the
words "auf weider sohen" (until we
meet again) be inscribed on the em
blem, but -ome objected to it.

"It is too much like tempting

CHICAOO, Nov. 2. Investigation
of an alleged combine of grocers and
jobbers was started today by Hinton
G. Clabaugh, head of the local
bureau of the federal department of
Justice, following revelations which
he said indicated an attempt to con

The investigation is in connection
with a similar one under direction
of C. F. Clyne. United States district
attorney, who today hid before him
reports of Fmall cooperative grocers
throughout the state who alleged
that they have been boycotted by
members of the National and State
Wholesale associations, because they
retail at low prices.
If the evidence warrants it, the
federal grand jury which convenes
hre November Sth, will be asked o
investigate.
Meanwhile a city council commit
