eral Scrutiny of Cam
paign Expenses.
The Democratic National Commit
tae has rccolved Information that
' 'Within tho last two weeks u fund
mounting to 11,200.000 has boon
railed Jn Wall Htreot for tho purpose
ot "putting Hughes over."
This fund, according to the tnfor
' matlon which reaches tho nomocr.Ut,
la noYVoliic to the Itcpubllcnn Na
tional Committee, which had raised
nearly ll.70n.OM ten days ngo, but Is
to bo expended by a commltteo repre
senting tho donow of tho fund acting
under legal advlco as to how to mako
tho expenditures wlthuot being com
pelled under the law to deliver a rc
, port.
This fund to-day was rcflnctod In
the odds In tho betting. Money used
In tills way cannot como under the
Federal scrutiny of campaign ex
,pnsos. A Arm of Wall Street lawyers
heavily interested In tho brokerage
. business nnd a mitltl-mtlllonalro
' magnate Interested In Western min
eral projects are bald to have framed
tip tho plan and cnglncerd tho gath
ering: of tho fund. Tho law firm Is
aid to have collected moro than J)0i,
000 alone. Interested in tho fund aro
" some of thn men who handled tho
llarrlman fund of 1220,000 In 1001 to
mi oh good effect that, according to
Mr. llarrlman himself, "50,000 votes
were changed In Now York-, amount
ing to an increnao of 100,000 In the
'vote for Iloosovclt."
Tho financiers who thought'riut tho
plan of Independent expenditure of a
i, million and a quarter dollars in tlia
Interest of Hughes were frank In tcvll
tng their plans to Interested persons,
according to tho reports which
reached tho Democrats. They simply
aid that unless a hugo sum of money
waa raised Wilson probably would be
leaked, and If a huge suirryof money
tras raised It was jj-'yeasonnble cer
tainty that Hughes' would bo elected.
Tho Democratic National Committ
tae'a Information Is that ft part of tho
fund has been turned over to the coni
zation, which will bpenil $500,000 in
advertising lu.tho wlndup of the cam
paign to counterbalance, If possible,
' tho effect of Henry Kord's advertising
campaign in behalf of Wilson.
Aa 'much money as needed will bo
uaed io win back UltMalxir vote, the
Democratic committee hears. This
work la In the hands of ofllclont organ

beer, ochloved without litigation and
practically without cxpeune to thn
city.
Whllo It Is true that nn ngreomcnt
lias been reached, the Public Kervlco
Cmiml.lnn failed to ratify It at this
afternoon's 'meeting. Instead, tho
matter was put over for ono week.
It had been arranged to close up
tho contract this afternoon, but tho
Mayor's announcement In advance ot
I lie formal settlement between the
Public Service Commission and fho
I'dlson Company and tho United Rlef
trlo Light and Power Company
brought up complications which will
havo to be adjusted.
Tho fact Is that Chairman McCall
and Commissioners Wood, Cram and
Williams, who, with Mr. Maltble, con
stituted tho Public Service Commis
sion In K'I6, entered Into a secret
ngicemcnt with thu Kdlson Company
that tlinro should be no reduction In
tho prico of elect rlo light for three
years. Tho agreement was to lvavo
expired May 1, 1318.
Commissioner Maltbio was out of
the city when tho secret order was
signed and did not learn of It until
sonio tlino after his return. Then he
got liuny In un effort to havo It set
usldo und his activities continued
after ho had retired from tho Com
mission und becama City Chamberlain.-
Tho present Public Service Commis
sion took the, inlitter up. In order to
reopen thu quostlon It was necessary
to obtain a petition signed by mo
hundred citizens, or enlist tho aid of
tho .Mayor. Tho Mayor agreed to go
Into tho catia as the potltloner, and
tho Public .Service Commission llnaily
forced tho Kdlson Company to ab.ui
don tho secret ngreomcnt. Tho new
contract terms aro as follows:
Tho llrst cut will taku ortect Jan. 1
and tho second July 1 next, Thw
maximum rnto for current will Im 7 i-
cents per kilowatt hour after Jan. 1
On July 1 thu rates will bo still fur
ther reduced to 7 cents per kilowatt
hour.
Speaking of thu settlement, Cham
berlain Maltbtii added: "I think tho

this method of sottlcmunt will havo

THOMAS RAPS DEALERS.
President bf Lehigh Valley
Declares They Are Taking
Advantage of Consumers.
Imprisonment for onu year Is the
penalty ahead of the conspirators who
aro Illegally raising tho prlcu of coal to
$i: a ton. They aro taking advantage
of a temporary stringency In tho mar
ket to boost the price to an unheard of
figure.
Tho companies thut mine coal and
ship it to New York have not raited
tho price above tho schedulo fixed
caj-l In the year, though they nru not
sending quite bo much to New York us
usual.
But there It no excuse for
charaino $12 a ton, and Diatrict
Attorney Swann and United
States Attorney H. Snowden
Marshall are rudy to proiecuto
conspirators plotting to rob coal
consumers by charging a price
that is practically robbery. This
is an offense against the Inter
state Commerce Law and against
the Donnelly Law in (his State.
K. II. Thomas, President of
tho Lehigh Valley Hallway Com
pany told Tho Kvenlng World
to-day that thero Is no valid
reason for $12 coal, so far ns he can
see. Tho Lehigh Company Is one of
tho lirgo.st producers of anthracite In
tho l.'ntted States. It supplies a very
largo part of thu coal used In New
York homes, factories and offices.
"Tho price of coal," said Mr.
Thomas," has not been advanced by
our company, nor by nny of thj oilier
big producers. Wo do not wish to
see It advanced. Tho present condi
tion In the retail market Is unhealthy.
It looks as if some men are taking
unfair advantane of condition! an, I
stirring up a panic for which there is!
no just cause.
NO EXCUSE FOR SUDDEN AD
VANCE IN PRICE.
"It i true that wo nru not sending
as much coal dally to Now York at
this moment ns the tradn demands,
but that Is no exeuso for either a sud
den advanco In price or for pcoplo to
try to buy nil their winter's supply of
coal In ono day.
"Tbo mines aro not producing coal
up to their full capacity, though thoru
Is enough for everybody If the con
sumcrs will only wait awhile.
"The miners took Monday off to
eclcbrato Mltchel Day and yesterday
.ro celebrato the festival of All Saints,
After Election Day there Is no holi
day In sight and wo hope io get moro
coal.
"In spite of tsmporary shortage,
we shall soon be ablo to supply
all the coal that is needed in this
city, ns well as elaewhero. If peo
ple will only have patience and
common sense this coal panic
will cease as quickly as It began."
"1 rliall take 1-reat, pleasure," said
Mr. Swunn to The livening World
reporter, "In entertaining a complaint 1
against the persons hu have com-!
blned Illegally to bend coal up (o thu
preposterous price of $12 a ton Unit
