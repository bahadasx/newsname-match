ATTORNEY
AND COUNSELOR-AT-LAW
818 Spitzer Building
TOLEDO, OHIO
Among the most enthusiastic
hoatmen of our town during the
years from 1874 to 1880 was John
Zurfluh, the watchmakar and jew
eler, Sir. Zurfluh was tho owner
of a fine largo boat, also he had a
fine large family, and nearly every
evening during the summer time
he in company with several mem
bers of his family would spend
hours after the heat of the day on
the bosom of the Maumee.
In the early seventies the writer
was the proud possessor of an un
divided one-half interest of ouo of
tho "boats" on tho river. This
boat was not a fancy boat at all.
No, indeed. On the contrary, it
was far from it, being only a few
boards nailed together, and in its
graceful lines and general shape
it resembled a huge coffin more
than anything else. My chum and
myself bought this boat, a pair of
oars, and a padlock and chain from
a boy named Ed. Willard for the
sum total of 75 cents in good hard
earned cash. Sure it was a bar
gain, and when we a rowing went
one of us' would have all he could
do in bailing out the water with a
tin can. But the fun we had, and
the scares we threw into some of
the other boys when we had them
aboard our little craft fully repaid
us for our proprietorship. But in
a few years later I became the sole
proprietor of a sure-enough row
boat. This boat was about fifteen
feet long, with two pairs of oars
and a rudder, and many happy
hours were spent by me and some
of our family and friends on sum
mer evenings in this fair little
craft on the dear old Maumee.
Boat racing was considered a
very popular and healthy sport in
the seventies, and nearly every city
and town in Michigan and north
ern Ohio on a river where the
boating was fine had its enthus
iastic oarsmen and a boat club.
There were three or four of them
in Toledo at one time. A boat
club was formed in Perrysburg
along about 1S74 or 1S75 by some
of the leading men of the town.
The name' given to this club was
"Neried." Where they got the
name iroin I never did learn. The
club started out in a very enthus
iastic manner, and in a short time
were the. owners of a very fine up-
to-date 10-oared racing barge, with
sliding seats, etc., built by the Hep-
burns, or Toledo. Some of the
leading members of this club were
Harry Hotchkiss, Will J. Parks,
Fred Eberly, Tess Oblinger, Simon
Uirth, and Jas. Timmons. Among
the other young men of the town
of that period who I think were
members of the Neried Boat Club,
but as to whom my memory is not
sine are Henry A. Ross, Ed. G.
Beach, Charlie Creps, Ed. D. Lock,
L. M. Wilson, Nat Callard, George
Crook, Freeland Powers, Ed. Er
win, Cal Shepler, Chauucy Taylor,
and Will Miller.
The members of the club put in
many hours of heavypraetice row
ing in the effort to' make them
selves proficient in the art. The
old red warehouse on the dock at
the foot of Louisiana Avenue was
used as a, boat, house. The Neir
ieds had their lOpared barge and
crew entered in the boat races held
in connection with the big cen
tennial 4th Of July celebration in
Toledo in 1876. If my memory
serves me right they brought home
third prize, crews from Saginaw,
Mich., and Wyandotte, Mich., tak
ing respectively first and second
prizes. Practice rowing and in
terest in tho" club began to wane in
1878, and it was not a very long
time after that the, club -was dis
banded. Tho barge was eventu
ally disposed of in 1880 to an ath
letic club composed of members of
the Toledo police force. They
came up after their purchase on a
Sunday afternoon, and there was
quite a crowd of amateur oarsmen
and others on hand to bid the old
barge good bye.
In the late seventies the late E.
D. Lock, C. O. Bisbee, and several
others wercrthe owners of a very
fiuo G-oared pleasure barge called
tho "Ripple." This was a very
swell boat, with upholstered 'scats,
and was up-to-dato in every way,
having been built to special order.
This boat was vised for pleasure
"The regular meeting of the
Civic Association which was to bo
held this (Thursday) evening, De
cember 14, has been postponed un
til Thursday, December 21, at the

Election of the bonrd of direc
tors will be held and other matters

SERIOUSLY' INJURED.
Track Worker Fell Off Hand Car
Narrowly Escaping Death.
On Friday, last while Harold
McOann, a member of the crew of
colored men who have been work
ing on the tracks of tho C. II. &
D. R. R. here, was riding a hand
car he fell backward from the
car, which passed over his body.
He was brought to the Rlieinfrank
hospital for attention.
His spine is injured and he is
in a serious condition, but hope is
entertained for his recovery.
SCOTT' HI WON.
The Bean Eaters Were No Match
for the Toledo Boys.
Scott Hi football team of Toledo
journeyed over to Bostontown and
played the Haverhill team who
were considered tho champs of
that section.
Scott boys were too much for
the bean eaters and cleaned them
by a score of 13 to 0.
riding exclusively. After a few
years the original owners sold it
to several younger people, who
after using it a couple of seasons
disposed of it to Toledo parties.
ihere were several racmsr boats
built in these years intlie Burg.
One that I distinctly remember
was a "two-oared shell," as they
were called, built by George A.
Bassett, at that time engaged in
the art preservative of arts" in
the Journal office. As George us
ually did everything in.a thorough
manner, he had a fine racing craft
with graceful lines when the boat
was completed. And he put in
many hours of diligent practice in
rowing to make of himself a pro
ficient oarsman. Another two-
oared shell was built at about the
same time by Hurley West. This
one was ot a somewhat difterent
pattern, and was made of canvas
stretched over a wooden frame.
Harley also was for a time an en
thusiastic oarsman, and did not
mind it at all when he "caught a
crab" and was capsized in his little
shell.
There were several other boats
built for racing in the Burg, but
they were not much of a success
as such, and were soon discarded
as racers. The two mentioned
above were the best of their kind
owned in the Burg, and were a
credit to their owners and builders.
There was a genius lived in our
town for a few years in the late
seventies. He camo from St. Cath
erines, Out., and his name was D.
W. Camp. He was short, thick
set, very dark complexioned, and
always wore a plug hat, and a pipe.
He kept bachelor's hail in a room
on Hio second floor of where Mun-
ger's meat market now is. ne
Avns a genius, all right, also a trifle
eccentric. lie had his jig saw in
one corner of the room, his stove in
another corner, his bed in still an
other corner, "and his dressing
table in the other corner. Well,
this genius was going to revolu
tionize boating on tho river. He
equipped an ordinary row boat
with a pair of paddle wheels,
which were propelled with a crank.
His schemo was not successful,
however, for several reasons. It
took altogether too much power to
propel the boat in this manner, and
tho churning of the wheels, though
covered with boxes, threw water
all over the occupants of the boat.
One or two trips over to Garden
Island finally convinced Camp that
his schemo of navigation with a
hand propelled side-wheel boat
was a dismal fuilure.
1 (Continued nest week.)
On Monday morning fire was
discovered in the Paddock Mer
chandise Company's building in
Toledo.
While working in the building
three firemen were buried beneath
the debris of the roof and stock
from two floors which collapsed;
For several hours Iloseman

fering intensely, directed the fire
men how to reach him.
Slowly tire men cut away tim
bers and removed iron rods which
held him fast. As soon as his head
was uncovered physicians gave
him attention until he was finally
removed to the hospital. IIi con
dition is serious and lijs escape

Captain Edward Welch and!
Driver Al. Urie were instantly,
killed. ' !
The total financial loss will I
amount to about $100,000, of
which Paddock Hodge Co. will
sustain the larger part.
The building was located on St.
