adeouate security for the future.
The chancellor said:

Berlin, Dec. 14. Despite Germany's
peace proposals. Field Marshal von
Hinc".enburgs declaration that there
will be no rest this winter still stands.
A military authority today repeated
this quotation of the field marshal's
remarks in commenting on the fact
that Germany weighed carefully the
peace question before announcement
was made knowing that England did
not desire peace because the allies in
tended to launch an enormous spring
offensive.

German Great Headquarters in the
West, Dec. 13, via Berlin to London,
Dee. 14. The German peace note was
read at noon on Tuesday to all the re
serves and to the troops resting behind
the front. Its contents were made
known to the soldiers at the front or
on the way to or from the trenches
thru announcement on improvised bul
letin boards.
The effect of the announcement
was to call forth spontaneous shouts
of joy, tempered later by doubt as to
whether the entente would agree to
make pt ace now. It is generally
agreed, however, that the note comes
exactly at the right time and that in
case it is rejected the fighting will
continue with renewed vigor.
- The inhabitants of the occupied ter
ritory displayed as lively an interest
in the announcement as did the sol
diers, and many praised the emperor
unreservedly for his peace initiative.

London. Dec. 14. Curly headed lit

fetted between wealth and nameless
poverty, was sent from the portals of
the house of lords today, held by that
body to be a penniless foundling f the
streets of San Francisco and not the

The house of lords, upon presenta
tion of the case of "Teddy" dismissed
the appeal from a court of appeals
decision that he is not the legitimate
son of Mr. and Mrs. E. H. R. Slingsby
and heir to a Yorkshire estate. The
respondents in the case were unheard.
In 1915, the child was established
as legal heir of the Slingsbys by the
court of probate and divorce. Two
younger brothers of Slingsby main
tained the child was the son of Lillian
Anderson and was adopted by the
Slingsbys that he might inherit the
Yorkshire estate. Advertisements, al
leged to have been inserted in San
Francisco newspapers by Mrs. Sling

evidence.

War Council In Chamber.
Paris, Dec. 1 4. Total prohibition
thruout France of whiskies, brandies
and liquors has been decided on by the
government. This is shown by the
text in the Journal Office today of
Premier Briand's declaration yester
day before the chamber of deputies on
the subject- The premier said:
"The government will ask you to
give it the faculty of solving by de
crees all questions of interest in re
gard to the national defense which the
laws-are too slow to regulate. A par
ticularly grave question which can be
regulated only in war time, the solu
tion of which involves the life of the
country and its salvation; is the total
suppression of the consumption of
alcohol."
The premier's remarks- were greeted
with loud applause from many of the
benches. Deputy Mayeras interjected:
"In the army ateo?"
"Yes, in the entire country," said the
premier.
The use of the term alcohol in this
connection is understood in France to
include such beverages as absinthe,
which already has been suppressed ;
whiskies, brandies and liquors, but not
wines or beers.

Another meeting of the Central Civ

tion should be taken.
Certain Topeka grocerymen declar-
ed today that many of the club women I
anticipating a boycott on butter and
eggs had recently purchased enor
mous supplies for secret consumption
in case the boycott should be declared.
Forty men and women representing
practically every club, in Tepeka met
at the Chamber of Commerce this
noon and discussed the high cost of
living. It was anything but an optim
istic discussion following addresses by
W. H. Davis of the ravis Mercantile
company and Frank Haskell of the
Beatrice Creamery company.
World peace and not a boycott is
the only solution of the hight cost of
living providing the people still con
tinue to eat, according to a statement
by W H. Davis. Mr. Davis didn't talk
long but his remarKs were enecuve in
describing conditions as they exist on
theliving proposition.
Prices to be Higher.
"ijnt'il the world is at peace we have
no relief in Bight," said Mr. Davis.
"Groceries and other commodities will
be still higher in price in a short time.
Many articles are being sold by retail
ers purchased under old contracts be
fore the supply had diminished. When
these goods expire they must purchase
more and they will be still higher.
"As long as the warring nations are
nothing but consuming countries we
are going to suffer from the high cost
of living. Before the war they dumped
goods into this country whenever our
prices became high enough to war
rant their shipment to America. .Now
they are buying our goods."
Frank Haskell stated that the high
price of butter and eggs would be re
duced automatically by the decreased
consumption, boycott or no boycott.
He denied that speculation did any
thing but increase the market price
of eggs and' butter, temporarily. He j
read government statistics to snow
that a smaller percentage of eggs and
butter are in storage at this time than
at the same time last year.
Need Concentration.
The conversation -swerved from
one living proposition to another,
taking in municipal control, or cen
tralization of distributing centers in
Topeka for commodities. Mr. Haskell
took the milk dealers and told of the
cost of delivery caused by a half a
dozen dealers with wagons distribut
ing milk on the same block.
"But you let Bill Davis over there
buy up all the dairy farms around To
peka," said Mr. Haskell, "and it
wouldn't be two months that you'd all
be crying 'bust the trust.
"Our whole system of thought and
reasoning must be changed before the
waste and high prices- we complain of
can be reduced to any extent. And
most of our laws must be changed.
too.
Mrs. S. S. Beggs, president of the
Woman's club, explained the object of
the meeting to get representatives of
all clubo present and have them de
cide on some concentrated action.
"If we refrain or boycott," said
Mrs. Beggs, "it does not necessarily
mean that we will refrain on eggs and
butter alone."
Hurt the Farmers.
If a refrain movement is decided
upon, Mr. Haskell advised that it be
taken on articles other than butter or
eggs, declaring that such action would
harm the farmers of Kansas, while
boycotts on other Koods would not
harm the "home folks" as greatly.
Both Mr. Haskell and Mr. Davis de
clared that the retailers were not
making heavy profits nor were the
commission men. Commission men,
they declared, were absolutely essen
tial under supply and demand condi
tions in existence at this time. Hardly
a question was asked while the two
men were talking.

Corn Sent by Red Cross Seized

Terrible Conditions at Guana
juato Described by American.
SI Paso. Dec. 14. Tho poor ot
Guanajuato, one of the large mining
cities of Central Mexico, are dying at
the rate of about seventy persons a
day, according to an affidavit sworn
to by an American mining man just;
out of there. The affidavit, which ha
been forwarded by government off!
cials to Washington, affirms also that
the women teachers in the parochiaf
school had been seized by Carranza
soldiers and taken to their camps,
while church properties were turnej
into bun rings and barracks. .
The document goes on to sav that
the poor were wearing native grasses
ror clothing and eating roots ana
twigs of trees and corn sent by th
American Red Cross to relieve this
suffering was seized by officials and.
sold at 13.50 gold a bushel. Mexican
laborers carrying the dead from th
houses were a frequent sight, the affi-.
davit continued, and many person
were executed in Guanajuato and oth
er towns of Central Mexico for stealj
ing food and clothing.
One church in Guanajuato, accord
ing to this same source, was looted
and a hull fight held in it and it was
then used as a barracks for soldiers
of the Carranza garrison. The women
teachers were forced to endure tor
tures worse than death, the affidavit
stated, and were then apportioned
among the soldiers.
WHY PEACE OFFER
Lord Northcliffe Says Interna
Dissension Prompted It.- J
Also Realizes the Enormous
Strength of Allies In 1917.
BY IXRD TORTnaiFFE. ,
(Copyright, 1916, by the United PresaJ
(Copyrighted in Great Britain.)
London, Dec. 14. Germany's peacil
proposals are due to the fact, whlcij
interned neutral correspondents la
Berlin have not been allowed to indli
cate, that during the last few weeks
grave Internal dissensions have arisen,
owing to the food shortage and the
reign of terror.
Moreover, relations have been great
ly strained between the various Ger
man and Austrian states and also with
Turkey.
Three Times Germany's Strength.
The Prussian government also ha
learned that the British empire will,
during 1917, put forth an effort equal
at least to that of Germany in 191.
and from the point of view of guns
and shells, three times that of Ger
many at any period of the war. '
The proposals have been received
here with contempt.
We are gratified that American,
senses of humor and Justice have seen
thru this bluff. France, Italy and lit
tle Belgium are firm as Plymouth
Rock.
Suspicions of Peace Dove.
London, Dec. 14. The caution
"watch out; take care" sounded by
Premier Briand in his address to the
French chamber of deputies will also
be Kngland's guidance in scrutinizing
the German peace proposals.
After the first shock of the news of
German's peace plan and the first anil
instantaneous decision to reject i
there came today, with a strengthen
ing of this determination not to make
the peace Germany craves, the belief
that Kngland and her allies ought
closely to examine the circumstances
of the Teutonic move. Press and pub
lic alike were more than ever con
vinced today that some "German trick
was behind the proffer."
Most apparent In the German peart
offer is the attempt to gain the sym
pathy of neutrals. An attempt t6
create dissension among the ententa
allies- Is believed to be one considera
tion of the note and the chancellor's
speech.
England and her allies, therefore,
intend to reject the peace proposals
but before that rejection they intend
to scrutinize every word in the not
and the chancellor's speech for hld
den meanings and to weigh nil ciri
cumstances of its delivery carefully.
