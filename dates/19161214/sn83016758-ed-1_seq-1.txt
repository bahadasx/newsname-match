PRELIMINARY STEPS
Toward the Organization of an Out-of
Doors Sports Club Taken at
the Armory Monday.
Committee of Seven Named to Com-
plete Preliminary Arrange-1
mentsClub Assured.
Preliminary steps looking to the
organization of an Out-of-Doors
Sports club were taken at the Armory
Monday evening, when about 150 res
idents of the village congregated
there to discuss the proposition. It
was a representative gathering of
boys and girls, old and young, and
much interest was manifested.
The meeting was called to order by
Chas. Umbehocker, and E. L. McMil
lan was chosen temporary chairman.
Numerous of those present offered
suggestions, and it appeared to be the
general opinion, that inasmuch as the
Umbehocker Ice Co., has put in a
dam just above the East Branch
bridge, a skating rink of sufficient
size can easily be maintained there.
A hill for coasting, tobogganing and
skiing will also be selected in that
vicinity, and the plan is to have the
hill and rink illuminated with electric
lights.
A committee consisting of Messrs.
D. R. Byers, W Doane, Clifton
Cravens and Raleigh Herdhska, and
Mesdames M. M. Stroeter and L. F.
Wilkes and Miss Marie VanAlsburg,
was named by the chairman. This
committee was empowered to select
the site of the hill and the skating
rink, and to raise the necessary funds
to place everything in readiness for
outers.
The committee met shortly after 9
o'clock, when the meeting adjourned,
and decided to inspect the proposed
sites Tuesday.
Another general meeting will be
held at the Armory this evening, and
it is to be hoped that it will be even
more largely attended than the one of
Monday evening. Preliminary ar
rangements will then undoubtedly be
completed.
This is a-movement-that is deserving
of the hearty co-operation of all.
Winter eports are healthful, invigorat
ing and the best kind of fun, and
Princeton citizens have not availed
themselves as they should of their
advantages in this respect in the past
Skating is one of the kings of winter
sports, while the mere prospect of
skiing down a hillside is thrilling.
And coastingscarcely anyone is too
old or too young to enjoy a ride on a
rapidly moving sled or toboggan.
Princeton citizens should get ac
quainted with the great outdoors, and
an Out-of-Doors Sports club will afford
them this opportunity. Attend the
meeting at the Armory this evening.
Public Library for Princeton.
Through the efforts of the W. C. T.
U. a start on a public library has been
made. About two hundred volumes
have been secured, and the books will
soon be ready for circulation. The
Ideal restaurant houses the library
and a reading table has been installed,
which is now ready for use It is
hoped that the library cards will be
ready to issue Saturday, and library
hours will be announced later. The
ladies are deserving of commendation
for their labors to better living condi
tions, and they are also entitled to the
help of all good citizens.
Spud Notes.
The local potato market has been
very quiet the past week Receipts
have been light, and there have been
no shipments to speak of, "Nothing
doing," sums up the situation concise
ly. Prices have been about on the
same basis as last week. Farmers are
receiving from $1 to $1.10 for eating
stock, while Triumphs are ranging
from $1.25 to $1.35.
The Chicago potato market ruled
steady last week, but trade was dull,
and anticipated strength did not ma
terialize. Unusually mild weather,
slightly increased receipts and a limit
ed call served to check recent steady
advances. The demand has been good
for sound tubers of uniform size, but
a good deal of stock offered has been
inferior. Inferior stock has been hard
to move and has had the effect of keep
ing down the price levels on choice and
fancy cars. The recent cold weather
it is expected will serve to instill more
snap into the movement.
It is expected that the potato acre
age throughout the so-called Texas
spud district will be cut fully two
thirds the coming spring. Seed is now
selling at $2.45 per bushel and at this
price it makes the potato crop entirely
too expensive for the small planters to
Historical
Minn
mi
tackle. When seed sells around a dol
lar a bushel, the average price for
seed, the potato crop is still an ex
pensive one and a risky one.
On the whole storage holdings in the'
hands of Minnesota operators are re
ported to be lighter than usual, but it
is estimated that most stocks are now
out of growers' hand
The New York potato market is in
very bad shape, and the trade never
saw such a dull market at this season
of the year. Although prices remain
high, trading is practically stagnant
and the losses that some of the re
ceivers are taking on high priced po
tatoes are very heavy. Despite the
slow demand "in New York and the
weak condition of the market the
farmers in Maine and New York state
are extremely firm in their ideas and
show no anxiety whatever to sell.
PRINCETON H. S. WINS.
Downs St. Paul's Church Club by Count
of 29 to 10Girl Teams Play.
The Princeton high school basket
ball team swung into winning form at
the Armory Friday evening, and clear
ly demonstrated superiority over the
St. Paul's church club of Minneapolis.
The church club came here with a
record of four straight wins, but the
local quint piled up a lead of 19 points
in the two halves. The final score was
29 to 10.
The first half was a real battle, and
the two fives contested on almost even
terms throughout. Princeton had the
edge, however, and when the shrill
whistle of Referee Olsen announced
time, the score board showed that the
Orange and Black representatives had
negotiated four field goals and a free
throw, for a total of nine points, while
their opponents had tossed three field
goals and two free throws for a total
of eight.
The second half was a continual
round of pleasure, and the floor work
of the local youngsters was more than
pleasing to Princeton followers of the
great indoor game. Each member of
the P. H. S. quint scintillated on the
offensive and defensive, and the result
was that the down river five was never
the running in this period. Ten
times did the locals toss the wind-in
flated sphere through the net^ while
one lonely field goal represented the
scoring efforts of the visitors. It was
a great comeback on the part of
Princeton, and conclusively proved that
the high school athletes are in the
pink of condition. They fairly oozed
confidence and pep throughout the
half, and seemed to score at will.
Hereunder appears the line-up of the
two teams:

A contest between two girl teams of
the Princeton high school was another
feature of the evening's entertainment,
and it proved interesting, although
rather one-sided. The sophomore
girls opposed a quint made up of
junior and senior maidens. The soph
omores displayed exceptional form
and romped off with the long end of a
22 to 4 count. The junior-senior five
scored two points in each half, while
the winners scored 12 points in the
first period and 10 in the final half.
Indications are that the Misses of the
local institution of learning will again
demonstrate to girl teams of neighbor
ing high schools, that Princeton girls
lead them all.
The line-up appears hereunder:

Scheen in the second half, Ruby Nygren for
Ella Jaenecke, Fern Smith for Mary Madson
and Hjoerdis Scheen for Eunice Neely.
NOTES.
The high-school rooters were out in
full force, and succeeded in making
themselves heard.
The visitors made a couple of
changes in their line-up in the final
period, but failed to stop the victorious
onrush of the victorious locals.
Wm. Roo's acted as umpire and g6t
by with it in good shape.
Of the two girl fives, the winners
displayed considerable the best team
work, but the losers had some good
individual players also. Prospects for
a winning girl team were never
brighter.
The high school is minus three of
the stars of last season,"'but the new
players are showing up well, and a
powerful scoring machine is being de
veloped. The team is there on the de
fensive, too, and when the conference
season opens will be in the race at all
times.
THRIVINGJAMLETS
Union Representative Visits Long Sid-
ing and Pease Saturday jftid
Finds Both Prospering.
Christian Reformed Church of Pease
to be Largest Edifice in Coun-
ty When Completed.
Long Siding and Pease, two thriv
ing and growing trading points of
Mille Lacs County, were visited by a
representative of the Union Saturday,
and the hospitable business men of
both places made the stays enjoyable.
Long Siding boasts of a ^general
merchandise store, that would be. a
credit to a place several times its
size. Wm. Lipp, the accomodating
proprietor, keeps a complete stock of
groceries, dry goods, shoes, gent's
furnishings, etc., and has everything
attractively arranged. Mr. Lipp lo
cated there six years ago, and. has
built up a profitable business. He also
acts as postmaster and as express and
ticket agent for the Great Northern,
but invariable finds it convenient to
pass the time of day with visitors at
his mercantile emporium.
Farmers the vicinity of Long
Siding are strong for co-operation, and
the Long Siding Live Stock & Produce
"Co. is a farmers' concern. Chas.
Jaenecke, a bright and aggressive
young man, is manager, and the com
pany is rounding out one of the most
prosperous years in its history. Hard
ware and farm implements are han
dled, and the company also ships live
stock.
The Farmers' State Bank of Long
Siding is one of the new financial in
stitutions of Mille Lacs county, but
under the efficient management of
Cashier O. L. Bye it is rapidly coming
to the front. At the date of its last
report it had deposits aggregating
$54,811.34. The bank building is a
neat and substantial structure.
Henry Ugiem maintains a branch
real estate office at Long Siding, and
buys and ships potatoes in carload
lots, being represented by Walter
Jensen. Quite a few tubers are mar
keted at thaipoint.
The restaurant and pool room oper
ated by Arthur Larson is a popular
place, and enjoys a good patronage.
The West Branch creamery, about
a mile west of Long Siding, is a pros
perous institution owned and operated
by the progressive farmers of that
vicinity, and it enjoys a constantly in
creasing patronage. Frank William
son, the buttermaker, is a practical
and experienced man, who attends
strictly to business.
Prosperous Pease.
The trip from Long Siding to Pease
was made in a comparatively short
time, over fairly good roads, although
the heavy fall hauling had left its im
press on same. Pease is rapidly as
suming the proportions of a village,
with its neat residences and substan
tial business houses.
The first place visited was the State
Bank, where Cashier J. Toussaint
greeted us with a smile of welcome.
This bank opened for business two
years ago last September, in a tasty
building of fancy pressed brick. The
deposits now total about $58,000, and
the business is in a healthy condition
and growing.
Pease is in the heart of a good dairy
country, and it is the home of a pros
perous Farmers' Co-operative cream
ery. Mr. F. H. Bartelt, the butter
maker, has been in charge of same
seven and a half years, and that he
is the right man in the right place
is evidenced by the gratifying growth
of the business of that institution.
During his first year there 105,000
pounds of butterfat were churned,
while this year over 250,000 pounds
will have been converted into butter.
Then there were only 52 shareholders,
while now there are 112, and each
shareholder is a patron of the cream
ery. It is a valuable institution for
Pease.
Mr. J. A. Jetsinga, the pioneer busi
ness man of Pease, is a prince of a
fellow, and enjoys a generous patron
age. He has been there fifteen years,
and now has a particularly well
stocked store, supplying his customers
with groceries, dry goods, shoes,
gents' furnishings and hardware. The
postoffice is located in his mercantile
establishment, and Mr. Jetsinga hands
out Uncle Sam's mail. He is a busy
man, but ever accomodating and cour
teous.
George Roulet is one of the 'new
merchants at Pease, succeeding F. Fe
bus. He has a good stock and is rap
idly building up an acquaintance.
A branch yard is maintained at
Pease by the Rudd Lumber Co., and J.
Pluimer, the manager, reports a good
business. Aldrink Bros, deal farm
implements, and S. Weevil operates a
blacksmith shop.
The one eye-sore to the hamlet is
the box car depot wished onto the in
habitants by the Great Northern. It
is better than nothing, however, and
in time will undoubtedly be replaced by
a suitable building.
Last, but by no means least, is the
Christian Reformed church, of which
Rev. A. W. Meyer is the pastor. This
is a beautiful edifice constructed of
brick, and an addition costing between
seven and eight thousand dollars is
nearing completion. This will be the
largest church in the county when
completed, and will amply accomodate
the hundreds that attend the services
every Sunday.
In conclusion we will state that
Pease also has the irrepressible small
boy, and he is the genuine article, as
we learned when ready to return to
Princeton. Boy power had moved the
product of Henry's Detroit factory, in
which the trip was made, from a point
near the Jetsinga store to a secluded
spot on the outskirts of the hamlet,
and it also moved the chauffeur to
give voice to thoughts that wouldn't
look well in print. No harm was done,
however, and the return trip was made
without mishap.
Lower Court Sustained.
The supreme court handed down a
decision Friday in the case of George
]A. Barrett, as administrator, appel
lant, vs. Village of Princeton, respon
dent, Louis E. Jesmer, as administra
itor, appellant, vs. Village of Prince
ton, respondent.
This case came on for trial at the
regular term of court for Mille Lacs
county last spring, and was an action
to recover damages for the death of
plaintiffs' children who were killed by
the caving in of a sewer trench. The
case was dismissed on the gound that
actionable negligence on the part of
the defendant had not been shown,
and the decision of the supreme court
sustains the lower court.
The syllabus follows:
George A. Barrett, as administrator,
appellant, vs. Village of Princeton,
respondent, Louis E. Jesmer, as ad
ministrator, appellant, vs. Village of
Princeton, respondent
The n\nntiffs' interests, boys about
7 years' ot age, were killed by the cav
ing of a sewer trench which the
defendant village was constructing
through the center of one of its prin
cipal streets. The trench was left open
and uncurbed for a time during the
course of construction. The soil was
sandy and liable to cave. The boys
were on the street for play. Close by
was the court house yard which they
used as a play ground. Boys came to
the trench at times. All this the con
tractor in charge knew. When seen
they were always warned away. At
the time of the accident no one saw
them. It is held that the boys, though
using the street for purposes of play,
were not trespassers that the defend
ant was liable of negligence but that
under the evidence it was not negli
gent and the action was properly dis
missed by the court.
Order affirmed. DIBELL, C.
Herbert Quick to Talk.
Herbert Quick, chairman of the fed
eral farm loan board, and a widely
known writer on agricultural subjects,
will deliver an adress before the Min
nesota State Federation of Farmers'
Clubs, Wednesday evening of Farmers'
and Home-Makers' Week, January 1-6,
1917. Mr. Quick is an entertaining
and instructive writer and speaker,
and it is the hope of those in charge
of Farmers' and Home-Makers' Week
that every farmers' club in the state
will try to have a representative pres
ent to hear his talk on a subject which
is just now attracting a very great
deal of attention.
Because farm credits is attracting
so much attention, the three days'
meeting of the Federation of Farm
ers' Clubs at University farm will be
given over largely to the subject.
Those who attend the federation
meetings will be able to take advan
tage of numerous other courses of
fered during the weekcourses in
cluding studies of the various farm
problems of interest to women. Speak
ers of wide reputation in all depart
ments will be on the program. Two
thousand are expected to attend the
varieus meetings.
Positive Signs.
Out in New Mexico even public
signs come directly to the point. They
do not waste any time in wondering
how the raader will feel about it.
In a garage in Albuqurke is posted:
"Don't smoke round the tank! If
your life isn't worth anything, gaso
line is."
And on the wall of a i barber's shop
at Qaos is prominently displayed:
"If you can't raise fifteen cents,
raise whiskers ".Saturday Evening

WELCOMEHOME CO.
The Boys Are Expected Here Tuesday
Evening and Not Later Than
Wednesday Evening.
Banquet at Odd Fellows HallPublic
Reception and Exercises to
be Held at Armory.
Just when Company boys will reach
Princeton is not definitely known at
presentprobably Tuesday evening,
but it is barely possible that they may
be delayed until Wednesday. Anyhow,
due notice will be given. But no mat
ter when they get here they will find
a hearty welcome awaiting them.
There certainly will be a hot time in
the old town that evening.
Of course the friends of the boys
will be out in force at the depot to
greet them. Then they will be im
mediately escorted to the Odd Fellows
hall, where a banquet will be served.
The Civie Betterment Club have this
part of the program in charge. The
club, it is unnecessary to add, will see
that it is a "spread" befitting the oc
casion. Every member of the original
company is expected and cordially in
vited to be present Civil war veterans
and relatives of the boys from Milaca
and the country are also invited.
After the feast a public reception
will be given the boys at the Armory,
which will be tastefully decorated for
the occasion. There will be short
speeches interspersed with vocal and
instrumental musican interesting
program is being prepared. Then there
will be dancing and visiting, and prob
ably a midnight supper.
A committee consisting of Tom Ol
sen, George Ross and Clifton Cravens
are co-operating with the ladies of the
Civic Betterment Club, and the good
people of Milaca also want to lend a
helping hand, and between them all
there will be nothing left undone to
make the home-coming an event long
to be remembered by every member of
Company G.
The general public are invited to
attend the exercises at the Armory,
which will probably commence about
8 p. m. Tom Olsen will have general
charge at the Armory, and Dr. H. C.
Cooney will preside at the exercises.
Yes, Virginia, There's a Santa.
An editorial which has come to be
considered the most complete and
beautiful answer to the question "Is
There a Santa Claus?" was printed
in 1897 in the New York Sun.
The editorial was inspired when
the simple letter of little Virginia
O'Hanlon, asking if there really is a
Santa Claus fell into the hands of a
member of the staff of the Sun. He
told the little girl in simple yet poetic
language that there is a Santa Claus.
The writer of the Sun editorial is
dead little Virginia O'Hanlon has
grown to womanhood, is married and
has a little Virginia of her own and
when the little girl asks her mother
about the existence of Santa Claus,
this editorial is the answer:
"We take pleasure in answering at
once and thus prominently the com
munication below, expressing at the
same time our great gratification that
it's faithful author is numbered among
the friends of the Sun:
'Dear Editor: I am 8 years old.
Some of my friends say that there is
no Santa Claus. Papa says, 'If you
see it in the Sun it's so.' Please tell
me the truth is there a Santa Claus?'
Virginia O'Hanlon.
"Virginia, your little friends are
wrong. They have been affected by
the skepticism of a skeptical age.
They do not believe except what they
see. They, think that nothing can be
which is not comprehensible by their
little minds. All minds, Virginia,
whether they are men's or children's,
are little. In this great universe of
ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in
his intellect as compared with the
boundless world about him, as meas
ured by the intelligence capable of
grasping the whole of truth and
knowledge.
"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus. He exists as certainly as love
and generosity and devotion exist,
and you know that they abound and
give to your life its highest beauty
and joy. Alas! how dreary would be
the world if there were no Santa
Claus. It Would be as dreary as if
there were no Virginias. There would
be no childlike faith then, no poetry,
no romance to make tolerable this
existence. We should have no en
joyment except in sense and sight.
The eternal light with which child
hood fills the world would be ex
tinguished.
"Not believe in Santa Claus! You
might as well not believe in fairies.
VOLUME XL. NO. 52
You might get your papa to hire men
to watch in all the chimneys on
Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus
but even if they did not see Santa
Claus coming down, what would that
prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus,
but that is no sign that there is no
Santa Claus. The most real things in
the world are those that neither chil
dren nor men can see. Did you ever
see fairies dancing on tbe lawn? Of
course not, but that's no proof that
they are not there. Nobody can con
ceive or imagine all the wonders
there are unseen and unseeable in the
world.
"You may tear apart the baby's
rattle and see what makes the noise
inside, but there is a veil covering
the unseen world which not the
strongest man nor even the united
strength of all the strongest men that
ever lived could tear appart. Only
faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance,
can push aside that curtain and view
and picture the supernal beauty and
glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah,
Virginia, in all this world there is
nothing else real and abiding.
"No Santa Claus! Thank God! he
lives and he lives forever. A thous
and years from now, Virginia, nay ten
times ten thousand years from now,
he will coontinue to make glad the
heart of childhood."

A New Industry.
Down at Luverne, Minn., a new in
dustry has been startedthat of dig
ging quack grass roots and one man
has built up an exclusive business in
the sale of roots to drug manufac
turers, and at the same time is doing
much to rid some farm lands that are
badly infested with this form of vege
tation. The only portion of the roots
that is salable is the white shoots or
tendrils that are attached to the main
root. A five-tooth quack grass digger,
with 4 to 6 horses attached to it,is
first used to dislodge the roots, and
the ground is then thoroughly gone
over with a Scotch chain drag that
rolls the roots up in bunches so that
they may be collected with a hay rake.
Three dollars a ton has been paid for
the roots just as they are pulled from
the ground. Further information can
be obtained in regard to this innova
tion by writing to the editor of the
Rock County Herald, Luverne, Minn.,
from which paper the above informa
tion is gleaned.
Good Roads Pay.
C. O. Kankel of the Terrebonne
Milling company is having his grain
shipped from Montana to Red Lake
Falls rather than to Mentor, although
Mentor is a two miles nearer haul than
Red Lake Falls. He says that the
roads to Red Lake Falls are much,
better and he can haul bigger loads
and make better time on the Jefferson
Highway than he can by going the
other way. If there is any doubt in
the minds of people as to whether
or not good roads pay, it ought to be
dispelled by such instances as this.
The farmer who can haul bigger loads
than a neighbor because he has a bet
ter road has the edge on him. All
other things being equal his land is
worth more. The sooner we improve
all our roads the faster our county will
develop.Red Lake Falls Gazette.
