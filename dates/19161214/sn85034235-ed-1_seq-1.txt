Every one who keeps au aquarium

The big white yacht Priscilla lay at
her mooring buoy,jiodding gently as if
hi approval of the sort of day offered
by the sun as lie lifted slowly out of
the sea on the other side of Sandy
Ilook.
The door of the stateroom next to
that- of Mabel Chester opened and
closed. In a few minutes there was a
patter of hare feet on the deck over
head, and a stalwart form In blue
trunks shot past her porthole, diving
cleanly into the sea. P.eing a medal
swimmer, of course Miss Mabel could
not resist having a look to see if this
person was acting up to good form.
The young fellow was using a power
ful overhand stroke and making for <i
bell buoy not far away.
"He's no novice," said Mabel to her
self, ' and. oh my, doesn't the water
look delicious! What's to hinder my
having a swim all by myself? Aunt
Virginia Carroltou would likely find
some objection if I asked her. Be
sides, it isn't 5 o'clock yet, and she
must be getting her 'beauty sleep.' I
couldn't, think of wakening her on any
Recount, so bore goes."
Donning a bathing suit and a close
fitting red rubber cap, she tiptoed
across the cabin and up the compan
ionway to the deck.
Some sailors were busy forward, and
as Mabel appeared a mate came quick
ly aft.
"1 beg your pardon, miss; are you a
strong swimmer?"—touching bis cap
and smiling respectfully.
Mabel was justly proud of her col
lege trophies won at aquatic contests
at Wellesley and Magnolia and very
graciously answered :
"Don't you think three medals are
enough?" and overboard she went in
the most artistic of curves, cutting the
water as perfectly ns a professional.
The mate dropped his deferential air
and hurried forward.
and hurried forward.
''ITore. Olson, and you, Torwald, un
sling (he gig. So! Lower away, now,
and stand by. Unhook your falls." He
said to himself:
"I was a fool to let her go; the flood
is Just running and strong at that, but
what is a man to do with a pretty lit
tle guest of Mrs. .Carroltou who has
taken three swimming medals? Order
her hack to her room?"
"I don't think I'll go to the bell buoy
this time," decided the girl. "Besides,
it seems to ho occupied by an observ
ant person looking this way." Mabel
had a most beautiful time. She re
hearsed nil the approved strokes and
cut up all the tricks she knew about
With the keen joy of youth and per
fect health.
"I think that's about enough for this
morning," said Mabel, after awhile

MABEL WAS ISaiiORIOUSLY LIFTED OVKB
THE SIDE OE THE GIG.
"Now I'll head for the gangway." and
she glanced at the yacht.
A nasty little chill ran through her
The ITiscilla was so much farther
away than she thought It would be.
"Mabel Chester," she addressed her
self, "stop that. You brace right up.
oid gill. I'm ashamed of you. You
won a two mile race once. The Pris
cilia isn't so very far away." And she
: took on her racing stroke. Looking up
after a minute, she instantly realized
I she was not gaining much, anil she
j saw something else, too—the yacht's
! gig was coming for her. Two me i
; were bending to their oars, and the
mate in his shirt sleeves was urging
j them on. .She glanced toward the bell
; buoy, and halfway toward her the oh
i servant person was coming with a
crawl stroke of the power of a tugboat
A doadiy faintness fell upon her like
h shadow, and the smooth depths
seemed to drag her.
"How perfectly absurd for me to go
i and got. myself drowned this beautiful
! summer morning! PH see if I can float
i I used to float like a cork."
A gleaming, sun browned figure surg
ed up beside her, a fcearty, cheering,
boyish laugh rang ont. and a strong
hand went under her Shoulders.
"You are a beautiful swimmer, but
the (1< odtide got you. They will be
here in a minute with the boat."
In a few inimités Mabel was rather
ingloiiously lifted over the side of the
gig, while Arthur Benedict, water polo
diamond medal hoi,1er, ranged on ahead
for the yacht's gangway grating.
"Are you all right, miss?" asked the
mate anxiously. "I should not have
let you go knowing the tide."
"Yes, indeed; I'm coining around. It
was all my fault," assured,Mabel. "It
would take more than three medals to
keep me afloat in this; tideway. I owe
my life to you and Mi-."— hesitating.
"I don't know his name, Miss Ches
ter. lie came aboard at midnight from
an athletic yacht club's launch. Hoots
but he swims like a king salmon!"
"Oh. Mr. Ferguson.'I,
"Yes, Miss Chester."
"YVe won't say anything about this,*
please, and could you arrange to dry
my things in the engine room? I'll
leave them outside my door in five
minutes ?"
"Easiest thing in ( he world, miss;
glad to."
Benedict had reached the grating,
for. the mate had not hurried the gig.
The burly Scotchman passed Mabel
over to Benedict, to jvliom she gave
her little cold hand. She looked her
thanks, but she said:
"Ferguson, says you swim like a
king salmon, and I think so too."
"That's worth more than cups and
medals!" And Benedict bowed gal
lantly.
Half lip the gangway Mabel turned
as he was poised for another dip and
whispered:
"Mum's the word?"
Benedict put a finger to his lips, nod
ded three times and disappeared in the
blue water.
"Mabel, my dear," said Mrs. Carrol
ton as the girl looked into her aunt's
cabin later. "Arthur Benedict came
down last night from Sea Gate, and !
want you to be very nice to him. He
is a splendid fellow. I have known
him since he was in knickers. He is n
nephew of your Uncle Henry's busi
ness partner and a Yale man."
Young Benedict, in flannels, being
duly presented, was asked by his host
ess if he was ready for breakfast and
promptly admitted that he was as
hungry as « shark.
"Due to taking an £arly swim, per
haps," lie added.
"Arthur, I have always thought yon
were part fish," observed Mrs. Carrol
ton. ^ ,
"Any mermaids .dt-wt; here,'- Miss
Chester?" inquired Benedict blandly.
"Why, did you see one?" asked Ma
bel. unshaken.
"Thought I did. Hay have been some
big fish, though, lie had a red head
and silver scales."
"And a tail like a king salmon?" in
qui rc<l Mabel, very much interested.
"Nonsense!" declared Mrs. Carrol
ton. "Tell us about that meteoric mo
torboat of yours, Arthur."
Benedict was at once all enthusiasm
and gave an up to date description of
all the different kinds of "water bugs"
that were, to take part in the race of
the afternoon. He explained that the
ideal toward which the designers
were striving, was a boat that at high
speed would practically skim along on
the surface of the water, not plow
through it.
"Why, my boat Zip will run on a
thin layer of fog, I believe! Watch
her. She's entered In the big race this
afternoon."
The Priscilla, gay with hunting and
flying the commodore's pennant, was
saluted by all the river craft as she
steamed up the bay and. passing out
through the East river, dropped her
anchor at the finishing line for the
motorboat contests off New Rochelle.
The Zip was brought alongside, and
Beiibdict took her off for a warming
up before the race in which she was
to start in half an hour.
Mabel, in a smart yachting suit and
wearing the colors of Benedict's club,
had wished him good luck and then
went forward to consult Ferguson.
That canny old Scot was not at all in
sympathy with the program for the
day, and, pointing to the snapping,
cracking, roaring contestants on every
hand, streaking over the water, he
said ns much to Mabel.
"Why, miss, when nature has sup
plied a good, spanking breeze-like this
the young fellows should be satisfied
to do their racing with honest canvas
to carry them along Instead of sheet
metal traps, full of machinery and
gasoline. It's just a craze to go fast
er than the wind and is of the same
piece with mile a minute motorcars,
airships and underwater boats. I say
it's flying in the face of Providence!"
"Why, Mr. Ferguson," quizzed the
girl, laughing gayly at the dour old
salt, "you wouldn't want to go back
to three stickers and canal boats and
stagecoaches, would you?"
"Who knows but what I would?"
And his weather beaten features re
laxed as he glanced at the honnie
lassie who had sought him so much
since the morning.
"Miss Mabel, there Is enough weight
and power in one of those racing
cockles to kick it all to pieces if any
thing goes wrong with the works,, let
alone the chance of an explosion."
Ferguson ""scowled again and picked
up Hts marine glasses.
"Here comes our boat, miss. Have
a look at her." he said suddenly.
Mabel gave a little gasp as she
found the onrusUtng Zip skimming
toward them like a swallow. In the
midst of the flying spray stood a fig
ure that looked to her altogether like
a viking.
Ferguson, who had lassies of his
dtvn. did not fail to note,the girl's
shining eyes and rising color ns she
watched and shook his linger at the
venturesome sportsman as he brought
his fragile craft to the line.
The commodore beckoned to Mabel
from the bridge, but she cried;
"Oh, Uncle Henry; please let me
stay here with Mr. Ferguson; it's so
much nearer."
"As you please, my dear, and you
may fire the starting gun when I give
the word."
The mate put the lanyard in her
hand, and she turned to the line
where there were ten panting water
greyhounds waiting and quivering.
Ferguson was watching the commo
dore.
"Now!"
Mabel twitched the lanyard, bang
went the gun, and they were off.
The course was a five mile sprint to
a stakeboat and back. One boat broke
down at the line, and three others gave
up with some kind of motor trouble
while the fleet was yet in sight; then
the others disappeared in a haze.
"Here, Olsen, and you, Torwald, un
sling the gig. Now in with you and
stand by to lower away."
"Why,, what is that for. Mr. Fergu
son?" asked Mabel, with round eyes.
"Just a precaution, miss. I take a
goed (leal of that," muttered the mate,
with his glasses trained on the course
"See them yet?" whispered Mabel,
on tiptoe.
"I can just make out three white

boats have turned the stake. You will
see them clearer in a minute or two.
Find one with two red spots on her
Itow. Tha* is the Zip."
For awhile Mabel eoukl not make
out more than three fountains of flying
spray; then, dancing with excitement;
"Oh, look, look! Take the glasses
Isn't that our boat out in front?"
"It's the Zip, leading by a hundred
yards."
"Our boat will win!" called Mabel
to the bridge.
So she did and blew up two lengths
over the line!
"Lower away," shouted Ferguson,
jumping into the gig. and down they
went. Mabel didn't stop to think;
there wasn't time. She just slid down
one of the falls into Ferguson's arms
"It wasn't anything for a gym girl
to do," she said afterward to Mrs.
Carroltou, "and. Aunt Virginia, I'm
that proud. I was the first one to see
him and grab him by the hair!"
"Him?" as though she didn't know
well enough.
"Why, Arthur Benedict, of course
and wasn't it a miracle that he was
not blown into hits!"
A week later when Mrs. Carroltou
was going to the hospital to see about
the young man Mabel announced that
she was going too. Before the head
nurse opened the door leading to Ben
edict's room she whispered;
"He will be all right in a fortnight
and it's a wonder."
Mrs. Carrolton sat by bis cot and
patted his hands, wrapped in dress
ings, and told him how glad they ali
were he would be'around soon and said
that ho must hurry and get well so he
could go with them on the Priscilla to
Bar Harbor in August. Then she
found that she wanted to say some
thing to the nurse and hurried out.
Mabel was standing, leaning on the
high foot rail of the cot, looking very
charming.
"Well, you won the race anyway,
didn't you?" waving her hand aloft.
Only Benedict's eyes showed out of
his bandages, but they shone very
brightly.
"Yes," he said softly, "and 1 am go
ing to try to win"— But Mrs Carrol
ton came in just then.
After Hie close of the season and the
Priscilla had been laid up in the Erie
basin Ferguson went to the com in o
dore's town house to pay his respects
before going to Scotland for the win
1er.
Mrs. Carrolton took imn aside as he
was leaving.
"J wanted to tell you that Mabel
Chester is going to marry Arthur Ben
edict in the spring."
"I am very much pleased, madam; I
am indeed. Each saved t'other from

SAFETY DEMANDS
FEDERAL CONTROL
OF THE RAILROADS
Qiiiy Way to Meet Emergencies
ot Nation, Says A. P. Thom.
STATES' RIGHTS PRESERVED
Principles Which Railways Hold Should
Govern Regulatory System In Inter
ests of Public and the Roads—Com
pulsory System of Federal Incorpo
ration Favored.
Washington. Pec. 4.-That the Inter
ests of national defense require that
control of railway lines should rest
with the federal government and not
with the states was the claim ad
vanced by Alfred P. Thom, counsel
to the Railway Executives' Advisory
Committee, in concluding his prelim
inary statement of the case for the
railways before the Newlands Joint
Committee oil Interstate Commerce.
"YVe must be efficient as a nation It
we are to deal successfully with our
national emergencies," said Mr. Thom,
"and we must appreciate that efficient
transportation is an essential condition
>f national efficiency. If we are to
halt and weaken our transportation
systems by state lines, by the perma
nent imposition of burdens by unwise
regulation, we will make national effi
ciency impossible."
States' Rights Would Not Suffer.
Sir. Thom eited many instances in
which shippers in one state were in
juriously affected by selfish regula
tions imposed on the railroads by
neighboring states. He pointed out
that federal regulation would be no In
vasion of the rights of the states but
would ho the means of preserving the
rights which they acquired when they
entered the Union, one of which was
the right to the free movement of their
products across state boundaries.
What the Railroads Advocate.
The principles which the railroads
believe should he incorporated In any
just system of regulation were §unt
marized by Mr. Thom as follows;
1. The entire power and duty of reg
idaHori should be in the hands of the
YiatiouuïTb(Vérîfinëîif .*except as foYnat
tors so essentially local and incidental
that they cannot he used to interfere
with the efficiency of the service or toe
just rights of the earners.
2. As one of the means of accom
plishing this, a system of compulsory
federal incorporatmrrshould be adopt
ed, into which should be brought all
railroad eor|>orations engaged in inter
state or foreign commerce.
The Interstate Commerce Commis
The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion under existing laws has too much
to do and is charged with conflicting
functions, including the Investigation,
prosecution and decision of cases. The
latter duties should be placed in the
hands of a new body which might be
called the Federal Railroad Commis
sion. Regional Commissions should
he established in different parts of
the country to assist the Interstate
Commerce Commission by handling lo
cal cases.
4. The power of the Commission
should he extended to enable it to pre
sci1t»e minimum rates and not merely
maximum rates as at present. This
would increase their power to prevent
unjust discriminations.
Justice to Public and Reads.
5. It should be made the duty of {he
Interstate Commerce Commission, In
the exercise of its |K»wers to fix rea
sonable rates, to so adjust tLese rates
that they shall be Just at once to the
public and to the carriers. To this end
the Commission, in determining rates,
should consider the necessity of main
taining efficient transportation and ex
tensions of facilities, the relntion of
expenses to rates and the rights of
shippers, stockholders and creditors of
the roads.
0. The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion should ho invested with the pow
er to fix the rates for carrying mails.
7. The federal government Bhould
have exclusive power to supervise the
issue of stocks and bonds by railroad
carriers engaged in interstate and for
eign commerce.
8. The law should recognize the es
sential difference between things which
restrain trade in the case of ordinary
mercantile concerns and those which
restrain trade in the case of common
carriers. The question of couqietitlou
is not the only fair criterion.
9. The law should expressly provide
for tlie meeting and agreement of traf
fic or other officers of railroads in re
si>ect of rates or practices. This
should, however, I« safeguarded b
requiring the agreements to l»e tiled
with the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion and to he subject to he disupprcY
ed by it,
"My legal proposition," Mr. Thom
said, "is that the Constitution as
now is gives full authority to Congress
to regulate the instrumentalities of in
terstate commerce in all their parts
If the power of regulation is to reach
Ike public requirements, it must he eo
extensive with the instrumentalities of
commerce."
Mr. Thom explained that the nmds
are not asking either of the Committee
or of Congress any increase in rev
nues, but that they ar e merely asking
the perfection of a system whietTwill
be
responsible to any need that may arise

Funny Error« In Advertisement«.
Laughable errors In illustrated adver
tisements are often apparent to the
thinking man. It makes one wonder
hy tlie designers of the ads. don't get
their information first hand from some
one who really knows. Accuracy, even
in advertisements, has the same at
traction it has anywhere else.
For instance, when the seltzer bottle
in an electrical sign on Broadway is
filling the empty glass the level de
scends as fast in the bottle as it rises
in the glass, yet the bottle is live times
as big. It couldn't possibly be. accord
ing to physics.
Still worse is a picture of a piano
with a pair of hands striking certain
keys. Fortunate it is indeed that that
piano can't sound, for the particular
keys struck would he a jangling dis
cord. Why couldn't the artist have
gone to a musician for a pleasing
chord among the infinite offerings of
music?—-Wall Street Journal.
Odd Numbers.
A hen Is always given an odd num
ber of eggs to be hatched. Why? There
is no reason at all except superstition.
Salutes from warships, forts, etc., are
always given in odd numbers, yet no
alid reason can be adduced. It is a
remnant of the old "odd numbers ar©
lucky" superstition.
Vergil records all sorts of charms and
spells practiced round odd numbers—
never even ones. Seven is tlie favorite
Biblical number, and old divines taught
that it held a mystical perfection. It
is an odd number.
Falstaff, in the "Merry Wives," is en
trapped for the third time He him
self said, "They say there is a divinity
in odd numbers," because of the old
belief in odd numbers.
Physicians of other days always in
sisted that "bleedings" should be in
odd numbers—one. three, five, etc., and
never an even one.—London Mail.
The "Ear of Dionysius."
A cunningly constructed prison car
era, consisting of a large chamber con
nected with one of smaller dimensions
situated near Syracuse, Italy, has gone
into legendary history with the title
of the "Ear of Dionysius."
Tlie smaller chamber was unknown
to the prisoners kept in this under
ground dungeon, and the tyrant by
whose name it is known had a habit
of secreting himself there to listen to
the conversation of the convicts, who
were mostly political offenders.
An ingenious device constructed at
the smaller end of the larger chamber
transmitted the sounds through the
partition, thus enabling the suspicions
ruler to hear even the whispered con
versations of his "suspects."

Scotsmen Ar« French' Citizens.
Every Scotsman is a French citizen,
with all the rights and privileges of
such, if he chooses to claim them. In
other words, every Scotsman born in
Scotland is also n Frenchman and to
thus possessed of two nationalities,
surely a unique position.
After his coronation at Rhelms in
1429 Charles VII. promulgated a de

rendered by the Scottish soldiers to
Joan of Arc, who defeated the Eng
