With the British Army In France.
Via London, Dec. 14.—Prom a Stall
Correspondent of the Associated
Press.
Several hours of glorious December
sunshine this morning brought glad
relief from a week of dreary days
and sent scores of airplanes and ob
servation balloons aloft and quicken
en the pulse of th6 entire British
army organization on the western
front. But before the daylight had
ended leaden clouds had again shut
in, the rain had begun to fall and
there was a somewhat gloomy return
to the wintry, weather-beaten war
far*.
Heavy sheepskin and leattfer coats
and Jackets have been issued to the
British troops and warm and dry rest
billets provided for those In the spec
ial reserve positions.
Five Meals for Tommy.
Best of all, however, Tommy In
the front line gets- Ave hot meals
dally. There Is breakfast at 7 din
ner at 12 tea at 6 and soup or stew
at 9 and again at 2 o'clock In the
morning.
From reports received from Ger
man prisoners and observations made
during raids the British have discov
ered that conditions on the Oerman
front are very different. Along most
of the new lines formed by the bat
tle of the Somme the German front
trenches are merely a broken stretch
of Unked-up shell holes with no
deep dug-outs and only a few Im
provised hiding holes where two or
three men can take cover In the
shrapnel.
Must Work In Open.
British reports from the Somme
section say the German communica
tion trenches are impassable from
mud and the shelling of the British
guns, BO that all the carrying of sup
plies and the bringing up of reliefs
nave to take place over the open,
without„ cover of any kind. Often
theahetlasor bombs from-the British
side throw up fountains of water
high in the air from, the German
trenches.. There are no floor boards
or other trench comforts available
for the Germans owing to the un
ceasing fire of the British artillery.
Germans Have Hard Time.
Thus far this winter, German pris
oners say their troops in the west
have not been supplied with any
sheepskin or fur coats. They have
received only woolen vests, body
bands and mittens. Normally, pris
oners say, they are supposed to be in
the trenches not more than from 14
to 18 days, but some divisions lately
have remained there forty days and
over without relief. The rations con
sist almost wholly of tinned meats,
sausage, herring, sardines, rice, rye
bread, coffee and mineral waters. Re
cently a ration of brandy has been
Issued dally to the men in the front
line. For rest the men often are
crowded into damp cellars.
Despite the freedom with which
some of the prisoners state the con
ditions from which they are glad to
be freed, all the Germans recently
taken assert that they and all their
comrades are thoroughly convinced
that they are at the outposts "defend
ing our sacred frontiers against
covetous and vindictive aggressors."

Peace Petition.
German Headquarters In the West,
Dec. 18, via Berlin to London, Dec.
14.—The German peace note was read
at noon on Tuesday to all the reserves
and to the troops resting behind the
front. Its contents were made known
to the soldiers at the front or on the
way to or from the trenches through
announcement on improvised bulletin
boards.
The effect of the announcement
was to call forth spontaneous shouts
of Joy, tempered later by doubt as to
whether the entente would agree to
make peace now. It Is generally
agreed, however, that the note comes
exactly at the right time, and that in
case It Is rejected, the lighting will
continue with renewed vigor.
The inhabitants of the occupied
territory displayed as lively an Inter
est In the announcement as did the
soldiers, and many praised the em
peror unreservedly for his peace in
itiative.
PROTEST MAY BE FILED
Pacific Coast Shippers to. fight Pro-,
posed Advanoe in
...
Portland, Ore., Dee. 14.—Pacific
coast shippers organisations are ex
pected to file a protest with the Inter
state commerce commission against
the proposed advance in transconti
nental freight rates, effective January
1, it was said here following the con
clusion of. the hearing before Henry
W. Thurtell, examiner for the com
mission. Seattle, San Francisco and
Portland shippers are vigorously op
posed to the new rates, which would
provide an increase °of ten cents a
hundred weight on a long list of com
modities both east-bound and west
bound between tho Pacific coast and
Atlantic seaboard territory.
A volume of evidence has been pre
sented to show that many northwest
ern Industries, particularly ship build
ing, lumbering and logging, wool
growing, salmon fishing and whole
sale merchandise would be affeotea
and some of them destroyed if the
proposed rates go into effect.
The proposed rates are the result
of the controversy between Spokane
and other inland cities and coast ter
minal cities. The Inland cities re
cently gained a decision ordering the
differential abolished and the rail
roads replied with the proposed ad
vance on terminal point rates. The
present hearing Is to determine the
"reasonableness" of the proposed ad
vance.
The hearing Is being resumed today
at Spokane.
Honeymoon 13 Years
Late Editor and Wife
Having Time of Lives
Comanche, Okla., Dec. 14.—When
R. L». De Long, publisher of the Re
flex here, was married thirteen years
ago, he promised to take his bride on
a tour such as other brides take.
"To Niagara Falls. and all that??
she asked.
"Well," said young Mr. De Long,
"not right away. You'll have to give
me time, my dear."
Mrs. De Long gave him time—thir
teen years of It, and had nearly for-'
gotten about his pre-nuptlal promise.
In the early years of their married
life she used to Inquire now and then
about that promised honeymoon Jour
ney, but De Long always said he was
too busy.
'58om« other time," he would say.
Recently the newspaper man's con
science went to work on him and
gave him the drubbing of his life.
Editor De Long slipped out and
bought an automobile. Then. he
learned how to engineer It without
letting his wife know about it. When
all was ready he invited her to take
the honeymoon trip. They are tour
ing Texas and New Mexico and hav
ing the time of their lives.

Anti-war Members of Com
mons May Endeavor to
Draw Out Government
FINANCIAL SIDE OF
WAR IS UP TODAY
Fourteenth Vote of Credit
Makes Grand Total Over
Three Billion Pounds.
London, Deo. 14.—In moving a vote
of credit of 400 000,000 pounds In the
House of Commons today, A. Bonar
Law, chancellor of the exchequer, de
cided to confine his speech entirely to
the financial side of the war, and In
the absence of .KMmler LloVd George
and former Premier Asqulth,' owing to
Illness, It was eJpscted the debate
would be merely along this line.
However, this will not prevent
members of the small group of peace
advocates from efforts to draw out
the government in regard to Ger
many's peace proposal, although It
was regarded as unlikely that they
would succeed.
The proposal of the Central powers
have not been received at the foreign
office this morning, and as it is under
stood simply .to refer to opening ne
gotiations, containing no terms, the
consultation, of the Entente allies re
garding It are expected to be purely
formal, preliminary to the transmis
sion of a joint reply. In any event.
Great Britain will make no official
comment until her allies express their
views.
Today's vote of credit is the four
teenth since the outbreak of the war,
bringing up the total for .the. present
financial year to 1,750,000,000 pounds
and the grand total for the war to 3,
533,000,000 pounds.
See Only Hope of
Success—4k^tente Still
H»Mudh to Do.
Berlin, Dec.. 14, via London.-r-It
cannot be said that the peace offer of
Germany-has been received with pro
nounced optimism by the press. There
is a decided tone of caution against
expecting immediate peace. While it
is admitted that the moment was well
chosen for offering peace In view of
Germany's success in Rumania and
her repeated demonstration of the
impregnability of her front against
France and Russia, the papers express
only slight hopes that the entente al
lies will show a willingness to treat.
It is not expected on the other hand
that' the overtures will be rejected
outright without an inquiry being
made as to terms. But in view of all
the recent utterances and reorganisa
tions of the governments on the side
of the entente it is regarded as highly
doubtful whether the allies will be
ready to make peace on any terms
without trying another year's fight
ing. It is recognised here generally,
however, that Germany's offer Is a
shrewd and timely dlplomatle step
even if no practical result follows Im
mediately, for it is contended that it
must convince the neutral states that
the responsibility will He now with
the entente and that it must strength
en the peaee party in all the bellig
erent countries.
Some of the papers feel sure that
the offer of the central powers will be
greeted by the entente as a cry of dis
tress and so regard the offer as pre
mature and inexpedient but others
think that it will now be impossible
for entente statesmen to get credence
of the versions that Germany acted
from a feeling of weakness.

WAR DEVELOPMENTS
Peace Proposal Has Not
Halted Struggle—French
Repulsed in Argonne.
While the warring nations are
awaiting definite developments from
the presentation of peace proposals by
Germany and her allies, the opera
tions on the various fighting fronts
are proceeding as usual. The Imme
diate future, so far as the peace
proffers are concerned, is indicated
as likely to be taken up by consulta
tion among the entente powers pre
liminary to the sending of the joint
reply.
Interest In military developments
still centers upon Rumania, where
the armies of Field Marshal von Mac
kensen are fighting their way forward
despite the difficulties of transport
caused by the bad condition of the
roads In a Rumanian winter.
Whether the Rumanians have suc
ceeded In establishing themselves
along the line of the Buseu, near the
southern Moldavian border, is not yet
apparent. Berlin's last specific men
tion In this connection was made in
last night's communication in which
the Teutonic forces were reported to
be nearing the Buzeu. In any event,
it appears that the Rumanian evacua
tion of southern Wallachla is virtual
ly complete, as the German war office
announces that Great Wallachla,
south of the Bucharest-Tchernavoda
railway, has been cleared of hostile
forces.
Beyond the German report of the
repulse of a French attaek in the Ar
gonne on the western front and of
Serbian assault on Bulgarian posi
tions In Macedonia, the war news pre*
sents little of Interest
Great Britain Is on the eve of tak
