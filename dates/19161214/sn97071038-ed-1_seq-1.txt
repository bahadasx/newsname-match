Address of Welcome, S. E. Not-

SAYS FORMER PASTOR OF LOCAL CHURCH
Rev. H. A. Van Winkle, formerly
pastor of the First Christian church
In this city, but now holding a similar
position with the First Christian
church of Oakland, Calif., delivered
the sermon in that city during the
Union meeting of Protestant church
es of Oakland Thanksgiving Day.
Quoting Rev. Mr. VanWinkle's ser
mon in part, the Oakland Daily In
quirer has the following:
"It is difficult to define thankful
ness. The reason tor tins is tne ract
that we do not all show our thanks
in the same way. Children do not
know our forms, but often they are
thankful without giving the obvious
signs. America is thankful today,
although it may not show it by
church attendance, or in any other
concrete form. I sometimes fear that
we do not show our patriotism as
we should, and I point to the way we
celebrate the Fourth of July with a
lot of noise which means nothing. It
is not the exterior token which counts
and we need a revision of forms.
Comes From Heart.
"The people of any nation are
greater than their achievements
ments. For instance, the great bat
tleships are achievements but they
are worthless without the proper
kind of citizenship. The heart of a
great man or woman is greater than
all the battleships, because the bat
tleship is decreasing in power and
the man and woman is increasing.
Preparedness means citizenship
first.
"Thankfulness comes from the
heart. We do not all show it the
same way. We are not made of the
same mold. We are individual. In
days gone by, men were known to be
great according to the number of ser-
accordlngnwIMAlnVa ace t t ao oin
vants they had. Now they are
known according to the number of
people they serve.
Christmas Is Near So Small Boy
Asks Santa Claus To Bring Gift
A letter addressed In rather a
queer handwriting and not at once
discernable, halted the gaze of post
master Richardson while he was go
ing through the routine business of
stamping the first class mall one day
this week.
The letter was addressed to Santa
Claus, North Pole. Inasmuch as
there is no postofflce at the North
Pole and furthermore since Santa
is already on his way to the States
with his annual load of good cheer,
Mr. Richardson did not forward the
letter, but will hold it here awaiting
the arrival of the Old Man of Yule
tide. The letter reads as follows:
"Santa Claus I want to make a
wagon so please bring me a key hole

- "We must remember that the most
thanks is shown in the idea that Is is
more blessed to give than to receive.
And we have that opportunity now:
It is more so now than in other per
iods of the history of the world. Sur
ely we should give thanks for it. Al
though we may differ from the presi
dent in his political arrangements, it
is a fact that we must realize he is a
prouct of humanity, a great man with
the Idea of serving. This, is not only
a holiday time. It is a thanksgiving.--
Blessings Many,
"This nation is so filled with bles
sings that it is something most extra
ordinary which would be noticeable.
Any person who has all that he wants
must of necessity look upon an or
dinary gift as a great thing in order
to require especial thanks. That is
the trouble with this country today.
It is too full of the goodness of the
earth to realizze the gifts of God.
Therefore, it does not know how to
properly show its thankfulness. For
many millions a good meal would
be a wonderful event, and yet we
do not show our appreciation. In
this war cursed world, we lack ap
preciation for the lavish kindness of
Providence.
"The two great powers for goed
are the schools, which teach of this
life and the churches which teach of
the preparations for the coming life
we wonder if Oakland people appre
ciate this and give the kind of thanks
they should. We know Americans
do not appreciate their power and
glory, for do we not read in the news
papers of the bitter strife, and of the
thousands daily who take their own
lives by their own hands. They do
not know. Forgive them.
"It is our duty to appreciate, and
so remember that it is more blessed
to give than to receive, and if pos
sible to show our thanks in our daily
lives."
saw very truly Jim Hager."
Jim Hager is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. J. O. Hager and is six years old.
He has been asking his father for a
key hole saw for quite a while, so
finally his father told him if he would
write a letter to Santa Claus, maybe
that kind old gentleman would bring
him one. Young Hager took his
father at his word, and now we have
no doubt but what Jim's Christmas
will find Santa Claus and the key hole
saw.
Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Turner arrived
home the last of the week from the
Farmers' Union convention in McMin
vllle. They were interested visitors
at the live stock show in Portland on
their return home.
New Abstracter
Buys Local Office
P. A. Anderson, formerly connect
ed with the legal department of the
Portland Title & Trust Company, but
more recently from LaGrande. where
he conducted the Abstract & Title
Co., has purchased the W. L. Smith
Estate Abstract Office in this city.
The consideration involves several
thousands of dollars. The new com
pany will be known in the future as
the Morrow County Abstract Co.
Since the death of W. L. Smith
several months ago, the business has
been conducted by Arthur Smith as
administrator of the estate, and the
office was in charge of M. A. Loehr.
Mr. Loehr has returned to his home
in Portland.
Mr. Anderson is a young man of
the progressive type.' He expects to
locate here permanently. Being
raised on a South Dakota wheat farm
he says this country compares fav
orably with his native state, and be
lieves that future progress will be
fast In Morrow County.
RESOLUTIONS OF CONDOLENCE.

whatever comfort and pleasure there
is in life to come, pur beloved and
faithful Brother may choose rest and
peace with life eternal for evermore.
Still we realize that we shall miss
him much in our councils, and will
look longingly to that vacant chair
for those words of cheer, his pains
taking work about our Lodge, room,
a work that few, if any of us will be
able to fill like he did. But feeling
and believing him safe In the care
of . Him who doeth all things well,

In that higher Lodge, where pain,
suffering and death are unknown.
There to dwell In blessesness with the
Grand Master of the Universe for
evermore.
Be it further Resolved, that a copy

HARDIN MILL PUTS
A. E. Bates of the Hardman
Flouring Mills Co., was in Heppner
this week making arrangements with
local merchants to handle the Mon
arch brand of flour. The mill has
been grinding for three weeks and
the flour is said to be of high quaility.
The mill has a capacity of 40 bar
rels per day, but as yet, they are not
running full time. Beside the flour,
Mr. Bates announces that breakfast
foods and pancake flour are also pro
ducts of the new mill. Much of the
output of the mill will be handled
through Heppner merchants, al
though home consumption and inter
ior trade will take lots of the flour.
Power to operate the mill is fur
nished by a big oil burning enginp,
which Mr. Bates says is cheaper pow
er than steam.
Mr. Bates is also a threshernmn,
and he states that considerable grain
in the Hardman country remains un
threshed. John Adams has six set
tings of wheat which in all proba
bility cannot be threshed out until
Spring. The scarcity of machines
and the enormous crop with the late
ness of the season has been the cause
of this situation, according to Mr.
Bates.
Experienced young man, wants
work on farm around Heppner. J.
H. Ray, Portland, Oregon, Gen. Del.
Robert Allstott of Eight Mile was
in the city Monday making final ac
count in the estate of, his father,

a member of the musician's Union

tions will be discussed during the ses
