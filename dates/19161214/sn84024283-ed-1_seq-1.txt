Frank Trumbull,
Advisory; Committee
I i f
I his views on the effect of regulation upon railroad invest-
Iments, said in part:
"The desirability of regulation Is, of course, admitted.
Whether the regulation the railroads have had is a sue
cess is a fair subiect for discussion. One thing is xer
tain there is at present practically no appetite for fresh investment in rail
roads; that is for new construction or large improvements.
"Now that an efficient banking system has been established by the Fed
eral government, a solution of the railway problem, fair alike to investors
, and to the rest of the public, is first in importance among our national do
' mestic questions. The interdependence of railway owners and employees and
of the shipping and traveling public has been demonstrated so often that I do
not attempt here to prove it over again.
"Are railroad managers entirely to blame? Suppose you are attempting
to administer a railroad in an honest and straightforward way. Most rail
roads are so managed; there have been some exceptions, just as there have
been wicked bankers, farmers who put their best apples in the top of the bar
rel, and other people who have made sharp horse trades. But in cither of
, the cases mentioned, does anyone expect the State to penalize the banking
; business as a whole or the apple business or the raising of horses?
"The situation is much as if you had built a hotel in -some good sized
: town, say, twenty or thirty years ago. Probably very few, if any, of the bed
rooms were provided with bathrooms. Perhaps the furniture consisted 6f a
. bed, a bureau, a wash-stand and two or three chairs. Suppose that after in'
; vesting your money in that way the State passed a law stipulating that the
price per room should not be over two dollars per day. Suppose after that
the State passed other laws requiring a certain number of bath rooms, ad
ditional furnishings, fire escapes, screens on all the windows, sanitary ap
pliances, etc. Perhaps these requirements are reasonable and in the public
interest, but where would you get the money for new and better hotels under
, such restrictions ot profits? I have said that the situation 'of the railroads is
; much like that, but the hotel Investment is simplicity itself as compared with
I investing in a railroad."
More Olive Oil.
It has long been observed that those
who treat olive oil as a common ar
ticle of food nnd use it as such are
generally stronger and healthier than
those who do not. There are many
ways of using the oil besides in salads.
It may be used with good effect ns n
substitute for butter, in compounding
the ordinary brown or white sauce.
A teaspoonful of oil odded, Just before
taking up, to every quart of spilt-,
pea, benn, potato or other soup, lack-
; Ing fat, greatly Increases its rich
ness' as well as its flavor. A child
soon learns to like the taste of olive
, oil on bread In place of butter, while
any kind of cold meat, that is to be
re-cooked, Is Improved by having a lit
tle oil poured over It, at least, half an
hour before heating. .
- Way of Eagle and Whale.,
There are two aulmals, says a writer
in Pearson's Weekly, that puzzle natu
ralists more than any others. They
are nature's submarine nnd aeroplane
the whale and the eagle. It Is known
that whales occasionally descend as
far as 3,000 feet below the surface of
the sea a depth at which, from the
pressure of. water, they ought to be
crushed flat. Why they are not in
jured naturalists have yet to discover.
It is this pressure that prevents a
modern submarine from descending
v more than some 300 feet. Eagles
have been seen, through telescopes, to
fly with apparent ease from 30,000 to
40,000 feet above sen level. At that
height no human being can live, owing
to the rnreflcntlon of the air. How
' th? birds live nnd fly nt far -greater
heights than man can endure U
another question still unanswered.

Making of Mistakes.
Big men make big mistakes. Lit

if they tried ; they haven't the ca
pacity. The fellow of strong personal
ity, the man who grubs nt an oppor

the mistakes do not amount to so

The Kingdom ol Poland.
After having assured the people of
Russian Poland that their ancient
kladom will bn' restored to them,
Germany and Austria now invite those
subjects of the Czar to Join the armies
of the Teutonic Allies. By so doing
the Poles take the risk, of being shot
down in battle or of being executed
as traitors to Russia it they are cap
tured. This invitation to make a sacrifice
of themselves for the cause of "free
Poland," is not, according to recent
reports, sufficiently attractive to ap
peal very strongly to the enthusiasm
and patriotism of those to whom it is
extended. Russian rnleof Poland has
been harsh and cruel, but the experi
ence ot the unfortunate conquered
PoliBh people who were subjects of
Germany and Austria has not been
any more happy.
In some respects those who were
under the domination of Germany
have had less liberty and fewer privi
leges than their compatriots of Russia
and Austria. Germany has gone
much farther than these other two
in her efforts to crush the national
spirit of the Poles. Laws were enact
ed of the most arbitrary and tyran
nical nature, such as forbidding the
Polish language to be taught in the
schools or employed by speakers in
public addresses. Coercion to anni
hilate their cherished traditions and to
Germanize an unwilling people was
used mercilessly.
The paper kingdom which the Cen
tral Powers now hang out as a bait to
lure the Poles into their military ser
vice is really without form of sub
stance. Its limits are not defined nor
is there any assurance given that, al
lowing that it should materialize, it
would include the territory of the
former Polish kingdom, which is now
held bylAuBtria and Germany. Neither
is anything said as to who shall be the
titular head of the restored kingdom,
although there is little doubt but that
he would be a puppet agreed upon by
Berlin and Vienna, in the selection of
whom the Poles themselves would be
permitted to have little say.
On the whole, the Poles have ample
reason to be suspicious of the good
faith of those who are now offering
them gifts and, in return, asking them
to shed their blood in the desperate
life and death struggle that is ex
hausting Europe, The Catholic Ad

A Different Colored Horse.
(The St. Joseph Observer.)
It is openly notorious that Charles
Evans Hughes did not accomplish
much as governor of New York but
he did one thing he made it illegal
to bet on a horse race. '
And he set his soul on this not a
very big or broad souk, as his recent
campaign painfully demonstrated
and did succeed in getting his anti-
racing legislation enacted.
And from certain speeches of his
during his campaign for the presi
dency, if he had been elected he would
have been ready to push his righteous
wrath against horse racing to such an
extent as to-make it illegal to follow
the business of a stock breeder in this
country. For none of his denuncia
tions of the administration and he
did nothing but denounce the admin
itration was fiercer and more horri
fied than his denunciation of it on the
charge of having appointed to an of
fice which some good Republican log
roller might have rilled a man who
was branded by Mr. Hughes as having
actually been at one time a stock
breeder.
. It seems, however, that in Mr.
Hughes' code of righteousness there
is a vast difference between betting on
a horse race and betting on a politi
cal race provided one of the racers
happens to himself. ,
It is notorious that 'a big bunch of
money was bet on Mr. Hughea tight
in his own town, and if he had any
qualms against that sort of gambling
nobody has ever heard of them. In
deed, Ibo favorite method of his
heaviest backer and the loudest lout,
Wall 6treet,was to offer to bet all com
ers to a standstill that nobody would
be in tbe race but Charles E. Hughes.
It was notorious that all through the
campaign Wall street Bought to dis
hearten the opposition by shaking
fists full ot "long green" in its face at
long odds; that the opposition instead
of being entirely disheartened res
ponded with sufficient Bportive spirit,
especially among denizens of the back
deestric's, who somehow harbor the
Impious suspicious that tney don't
know everything down in the Judee
ot little Old
Noo Yok and that the
world doesn't end at the Jumping
off bank of the Hudson river across
from , Hoboken, as to accept a
goodly portion of these offers to bet
on a race that was altogether accord-
Ing to the Gospel of Saints Matthew,
Mark, Luke and Charles, since it was
not a horse race.
And so far as it is known not a wave
ot trouble rolls across Charles Evans'
peaceful breast as be contemplates the
transfer ot mllllions of Wall street's
good money to the wilds that lie be
yond the waters of the Hudson In the '
settlement of these wagers, which
were not only legitimate because they

were laid on s race that wasn't a horse
race, but were actually commendable
because they were laid to help along
the race of a candidate who would
aboliBU both horse races and race
horses.
A Republican View.
(From the Fotosi JournalJ
The Perrjr County Republican In its
issue of November 23d, in commenting
on the recent congressional election,
among other things said, "For some
reason or other Rhodes ran behind in
nearly every county in the district."
Returns filed in the office of the Secre
tary ot State, as certified from the
various counties of the district, show
that Mr. Rhodes ran ahead of Hughes
for President and Lamm for Governor
in the district. He received 17,537,
Hughes, 17,415, and Lamm, 17,485. An
examination of the Perry County vote
does show,that Mr.jRbodes ran 29Jvotes
behind Hughes in that county, which
is probably the basis of the editorial.
It might be well for the Republican to
direct the inquiry to Perry County, as
it seems to have been the only county
in the district in which Rhodes ran be
hind his ticket to amount to anything
whatever. Here is the official vote
by counties on file in the office of the
Secretary of State:

It would seem to the generous mind
that the Republican might have wait
ed at least until the bitterness o'f de
feat had been somewhat forgotten
by Mr. Rhodes and his friends before
selecting a candidate for 1918. . A
little bit of loyal sympathy expressed
at this time would come with better
grace, because all admit that Rhodes
made the most aggressive campaign
made in the Thirteenth District by a
Republican nominee. He not only
bad Hensley to beat, but in the last
week of his campaign the great in
fluence of JPhamp Clark, Senator
Reed, ex-Governor D'ockery, William
Jennings Bryan and ex-Governor
Folk, all of whom spoke in the dis
trict in the interest of Mr. Hensley.
The Democrats made no such effort
in any other district in the state, and,
with all this, Rhodes was defeated by
only 313 votes. Wilson carried the
district over Hughes 534, Woodson
for Supreme Judge over Johnson by
592, Gardner over Lamm by 325.
We feel that Mr. Rhodes is to be
complimented on tne splendid race he
made, and it is doubted whether any
man without legislative experience
could have done as well. While it is
too early to announce a candidate for
Congress in 1918, and we do not know
what the future intentions of Mr.
Rhodes are in that regard, yet it is
certain he made a great race, and
with a good official record to his cred
it, as well superior qualifications for
the office, we see no reason why be
should not be the nominee without
opposition in 1918,
Quantity of Feed Important For Wintering
Dairy Lows.
Quantity of feed ranks next to the
kind of feed in dairy rations. Eco
nomical feeding demands that cows
be fed as individuals, and not as a
herd. Too frequently each cow in
herd is fed the same amount of grain,
regardless of how, much milk she. is
producing. By this practice some
cows will be underfed, while others
will be overfed.
It should be understood that an ani
mal always uses a certain amount of
the food it receives to maintain tbe
body. This Is the first use to which
the food IB put, and is called tbe
ration of maintenance. This amount
is required by the animal whether or
not she is producing milk. All feed
above this amount is used for milk
production, or is stored on the body
of tbe animal as fat. In the case of
the young animal part of this excess
is used for growth.
Of the two mistakes made in' feed
ing, perhaps underfeeding is most
common, according to O. H. Eckles ot
the Missouri- College of Agriculture.
It is a serious mistake to feed a cow
only enough to keep up her .body.
She must receive feed to keep her
milk production up to oapacity. it a
j cow loses weight while in milk, she is
not receiving sufficient food. A good
cow, if not fed enough, will produce
milk at tbe expense of her body; that
is, she will take the surplus flesh from
; her body, and convert it into milk and
thereby will lose live weight. On the
. other hand,- when a oow is overfed
abe will begin to fatten in a short
time. This condition may be correct-
ed by giving her only the amount she
needs for maintenance and . for milk
production. Such feeding will main
tain practically a uniform weight.
Roughness is the first important
consideration In feeding. cows. A oow
jt la not eontended unless her' stomach
is full. She should always have all
tbe roughness that she will clean op
and then the amount of grain she re
ceives should be regulated by - the
amount of milk produced. A dry cow
in good condition should be fed rough
ness only, and does not need any
grain. In feeding grain to milk pro
ducing cows, the following rule may
be used, and is found to work fairly
well: Feed 1 pound of grain for each
3 pounds or pints of milk produced.
A Jersey cow producing very rich
milk may need a little more grain
than the amount given.
Fattening Poultry for Marketing.
Chickens may be taken from the
range, fed expensive feeds and sold
for an economical gain, according to
H. L. Kempster of the college of
Agriculture of the University of Mis
souri. Tests have proved that the
birds will gain approximately 23 per
cent in twelve to fourteen days feeding.
The grain required to each pound of
gain of the chicken was three and one
half pounds or about eight cents.
The chickens were confined in coops
two by two and one-balf feet square
with wire bottoms. Slats were placed
across tbe front permitting them to
feed from the trough outside. The
ration consisted of corn meal, 7
pounds; shorts, 3 pounds; bran,
pound. To each pound was added
two pounds of sour milk. This wet
mixture was fed twice daily. The
confinement encourages gain through
lack of exercise and causes the flesh to
soften, making the meat more delect
aole and luscious.

Warning to Buyers of Baled Hay. -
The department is investigating the
practice of some shippers of hay of
veneering or facing the bales. Veneer
ing consists in feeding to the baling
machine an occasicnal forkful of bay
that is of higher grade than the bulk
of the lot being baled and manipulat
ing the forkful In such a way that the
high-grade bay covers the outside
of the bale, making the bale appear
to contain better bay than it actually
does contain. Tbe National Hay As
sociation has requested the depart
ment to cooperate with it in trying
to eliminate this practice, believed to
be dishonest. Buyers of baled hay
are warned to be on the lookout for
this practice in order to avoid accept

grade of hay than they intend to pur

Do not Plant Trees Deep M. U. Professor
Advises.
The beginner in tree planting usually
sets his trees too deep rather than too
shallow in the relatively heavy soils
of Missouri, J. C. Whitten of the de
partment of horticulture of the Uni
versity of Missouri says. Young trees
should be selected for planting and
they should be set at the same depth
at which they stood in the nursery,
Trees turn to the northeapt and
grow crooked beca' f tht warm
south and southwest winds during the
growing season. The tree should be
set with the heavier side to the south
west to avoid this.
The roots should be trimmed so not
to be cramped and any ragged wounds
taken off.
Peach trees should be pruned most
severely after planting of any of the
orchard fruits. Trim all branches off
leaving a single whip, then shorten
the whip to a height of about two and
one-half feet. Cherry trees should be
less severely trimmed. If well branch
ed the center of tbe tree should be
cut out. The Japanese plum tree
shonld be shaped like the peach.Otb
er plum, apple and pear trees having
only a single whip should be treated
likewise. Older trees may be treated
like the cherry with the exception
that all branches may be shortened to
one-half or one-third of their natural
length.
Dr. J. Q. Adams Dead.
(The Steelville Ledger.) .
This community was shocked on
Thanksgiving day when the news was
flashed over the town that Dr. J. Q
Adams of Jnplin was dead. A tele
gram to his brother-in-law, Dr. J. T
Wilson, in this city announced the sad
news. His death occurred ..November
30, 1916.
Dr. Adams was a son to Dr. J. R
and Anna DeLacy Adams of Goodland
Mo., and was 40 years of age. Dr,
Adams was well known in Missouri
having practiced medicine for ten
years at Belleview, Mo. He moved
with his family from Belleview to
Mullen, Nebraska, where he resided
for eight years, and only recently
moved to Joplin, Mo.
He was a graduate of the Hospita
College of Medicine of Louisville
Kentucky, where he graduated with
honors. He was a bright star in the
profession and was eminently success
ful.
He was a member of the Episcopal
church having with his two daughters
Thelma and Marian, united with this
body last May. He was an honored
member of the Masonio fraternity
M. of A., and the Woodmen of the
World.
Here where he attended school and
first became acquainted with our peo
pie, he met Miss Minnie Craig, daugh
ter of tbe late J. R. Craig, of near
Cook Station. Friendship ripened
into love and the final chapter of this
happy and important event In , his
young days found its completion at
the marriage altar
His remains were shipped to Steel
ville arriving at 4:80 p. M., Tuesday
Tbey were accompanied by Dr. Wil
son and wife; Irwin Adams, of Free
no, Cal.; Sherman Adams, of Good
land, Mo.; Berlin Adams, of Mullen.
Neb. Many beautiful floral offerings
accompanied the body, some from
Omaha and Mullen, Neb., where he
was held In high esteem.
Aside from his children and loving
wife, other members of his family as
follows survive him: David R.Adams,
of Fresno, Cal.; E. M. Adams, of
Miles City, Mont.; Mrs. Helen A.
Johnson, of Lesterville, Mo,, and Mrs.
Lucy Oesch, of St. "Louis. .
Immediately upon arrival in this
city the remains were taken charge
of by Lebanon Lodge No. 77, A. F. &

Obituary.
Em ley Adele Duncan, nee Davis,
daughter of J. 3. and Sarah E. Davis,
of Des Arc, Mo., was born March 22 J,
1898, and died December 1, 1916, aged
18 years, 8 months and 9 days.
On March 26, 1916, she was married
to William Lee Duncan, of Brunct,
who, with her parents and other rela
tives and friends, remain to mourn
her going away. While it is always
most truly an occasion of peculiar
sorrow when young life like hers is
cut off just in tbe beginning of its
greatest happiness, yet we bow in
submission to the will ot Him who
does all things well and look forward
to the time when we again Bhail see
those we have loved and lost."
Sister Duncan became a member of
the M. E. Church, South, at Des Arc,
on September 14, 1914, and continued
in the Christian'faith unto tbe end.
Tha funeral services were held in
the Methodist church at Des Arc, be.
ing conducted by her pastor, assisted
by Rev. M. DeBoard, president of tbe
Holiness College, after which the re
mains were laid to rest in the Des Arc .
cemetery.
To her friends and loved ones her
life is her own beet eulogy. Though,
no doubt, she would have been glad to
have remained here, she willingly
passed on to the better land, request
ing her relatives and friends to rejoin
her over there. ' May we who remain
have such sure faith and confidence
as will give to each of us a like victo
