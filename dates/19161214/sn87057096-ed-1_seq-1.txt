and .Eli Phipps were born
in Washington county, Virginia,
Feb. 14, 1812. It was a few months
before the declaration"of war against
England in 1812. The battle of
Waterloo had not beei fought^ at
this date. During his life time the
world has advanced more tnan in the
1800 years previous to his btrtn.
He was born* before Fulton built his
steamboat and long before, the .dis
covery Of electricity and railroads
and telegraph lines built.
The'temperate manner of life
which no doubt has been the chief
factor In its longevity featured his
years. Fond of the outdoors be took
much exercise in the open. He wa*.
a farmer all his lite and it is only
of recent years that he has ceased
hard work. Mr. Phipps came to
Iowa in *36, before the states ad-:
mission to the union, when the pop
ulation consisted of frontier Bettle
mfentii along the streams and rivers.
Mr. PhTpps came to Farragut frdm
Independence, Mo.t and lived 'most
of his life in the three states of
Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska. He
never used tobacco, opiates or li
quor. His food was plain and corn
bread, butter milk and cider were
favorites. A nap ^t noon was part
of his program for a long life, as
well as to spend a great part of the
time outdoors. Few speUs of sick
ness were experienced in his lite.,
Mr. PhippB was especially social
able and had a wide acquaintance
of friends. Often times he would
board a train and take long trips to
Nebraska and Leon to visit his rela
tives making the journey alone even
after he Was 100 years old. Many
acres of land have been owned by
him and all of it has been given to
his children, he retaining only
enough wealth to live comfortably.
Some years ago Mr. Phipps' fame
was spread over the United States
when Chicago and other dailies
printed much about his life, and
sought to prove that he was father
of John D. Rockefeller. In the
history or the Standard Oil com
pany, Miss Ida M. Tarbell. celebrat
ed magazine writer, stated that Wil
liam Rockefeller, father of John
D., was living under an alias name
near a small town in the middle
west. Clues pointed to the Shenan

WAS DEAD MANY HOURS
Miss Flora Thomason found Dead
OR Floor of Mother's Home in
South Part of Town.
Miss Flora Thomason, a colored
lady about 50 years of age, was
found lying on the floor at the home
of her mother in south Leon Tues
day afternoon, and had evidently
died some time Monday evening.
Miss Thomason resided with her
aged mother, the latter being very
Heebie in mind, and about ail that
could be learned from her was that
Flora had laid down on the floor,
and she found she was cold, so had
covered her with blankets, and she
slept beside her on the floor. The
deceased had been a sufferer from
abdominal tumor of great size for a
number of years, but had refused to
allow an operation to be performed,
and this tumor was probably the
cause of her death. A brother from
Oskaloosa and a sister from Beth
any. Mo., came yesterday afternoon
to attend her funeral. She had re
sided with her mother in this city
since she was a small girl.

4 per cent per annum.
"This year we have eight different

be much larger than the one we are
just paying out. Our membership
consists of people in all walks of
life.
"There are eight different classes
in this club.
"We find the people planning to
use their savings in different ways.
Some will deposit all or a portion of

made a big success of salesmanship,
his success as a salesman for the J.

resulting in their selecting him a

The horns are as perfect a pair as

They measure a trifle over eleven
feet from tip to, tip, and make a fine
ornament for the walls of the nicest
lodge room in this part of the state.
Arthur secured them at Sterling,

times, but he said they were for old
Hesperia.

scoundrel who caused this hard
working young lady to all the ex
pense of.a trip home, as well as what
was paid for the bogus telegram,
should suffer the extreme penalties
of the law, but it is very doubtful
if he is ever heard from.

Declamatory and -Music Contest.
The rural schools declamatory and
music contest held at the Methodist
church, last Saturday was a decided
success.
In the declamatory, first place was
given Harold LaFollette or Morgan
township, on "Who's Afraid. $5.00
seconu, Dorothy Stiles, Franklin
township, "Mary Carey," $3.00. We
wish to state here that the selection,
"A Boy's Troubles," by Vaughn Hale
was given first place, but on account
of him being dressed for the part,"
was against the rules of the contest,
he was given thirfl place. The selec
tion was cleverly riven and is worthy
of mention.
In the music contest the judges
thought it hard to make a distinc
tion. AP of the songs were well ren
dered. However, the first prize of
was awarded for "Decatur County
Rally Song," given by the Vine Oak
school of Hamilton township. Sec
ond prize of $3 went to Eden Center,
Eden township, on the "Swing Song.'
Special mention should be made of

Mouse."
All of the selections both in the
declamatory and' music were well
rendered and were real good.

IDLE HOUR SPECIALS.
Blanche Sweet in "Tlie Secret Sin"
Friday, and Hazel Dawn in "The
Masqiieraders" Monday.
The Paramount feature plays at
the Idle Hour for Friday and Mon
day are extra good attractions, with
Blanche Sweet and Hazel Dawn in
the leading roles, and both are favor
ites with Leon theatre goers.
In a career that has been remark
able from every point of view, Miss
Sweet now approaches the height of
her powers as a photoplay star. Noth
ing she has done previously on the
screen is marked with so much ar
tistry, grace and finish as her per
formance of "twin sisters" in the
Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Co.'s
production, "The Secret Sin," by
Margaret Turnbull. In this photo
play we have the combination of a
great star and a great play. "The
Secret Sin" is a bitter pronounce
ment against the drug evil and the
trade in opium against which the
United States government for years
has waged an unceasing battle. With
all the skill of the Lasky artistic
forces centered on this photoplay,
"The Secret Sin" from the viewpoint
of photography, attention to minute
detail and sheer sincerity will take
its place with the masterpieces of the
screen As Miss Sweet appears as
"twins" there are episodes in the
play when she appears in two char
acters simultaneously.
In the role of Dulcie, the central
character of "The Masqueraders,"
and the girl who becomes a barmaid
in the Stagg Inn in order to save the
family fortunes, beautiful Hazel
Dawn does the most remarkable
work of her career. It is phenome
nal that an actress who has gained
an international reputation as a mu
sical comedy star anu who has never
appeared before the footlights in any
but musical comedy roles, should
suddenly become one of the most
transcendent of motion picture celeb
rities. Deprived of the voice, violin
and wonderful dancing which made
her the idol of the theatre, she has
captured the motion picture public
by reason of her great beauty and
her genuine histrionic cleverness. In
The i.ia8queraders"-Henry Arthur
Jones the noted English playwright
has achieved the impossible in the
co-mingling of comedy and drama
The gay and delightful girl, who
auctions oif a kiss for charity, tires
of her life at the inn and marries a
wealthy man, only to find that he is
a drunkard and a rogue. Trial and
tribulation follow rapidly upon each
other, culminating in a tensely dra
matic situation, in which her hug
band actually stakes her at cards
against the fortunes of the man who
loves her.
Usual 3 o'clock matinees at 10
cents admission. First evening
shows at 7:15, prices 10 and 15
cents.
