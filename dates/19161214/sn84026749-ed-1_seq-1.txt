Kald about the conditions and tho
compensation of department workers
in Washington.
flomo recent effort to increase tho
wage of Oovornment clerks to some
where near an nssuranco of respect
nblo living conditions, liavo called
forth protest from certain uninformed
quarters, which cannot bo allowed to
pass without notice, for example the
New York Times n day or two ago
editorially denounced the proposal that
30 per cent bo added to salaries under
J 1,200, and C per cent to those uboo
and up to Jl.bOO.
A Kerf York Viewpoint f.

Curiously enough, In the samn arti

because It fixed tlm snlary of mem

German Note to Be Transmitted
Without Comment From
This Country.
PRESIDENT'S MIND IS OPEN
Still Undetermined as to His
Course Toward Move From
Berlin Government.
AWAITS OFFICIAL REPORTS
Wants to Learn Attitude of the
Allies Before Taking
Any Action.
America's first step toward carrying
out the wishes of Germany and the
central powers, as their diplomatic
leprcsontatlve In entente allied capi
tals, Is to be taken today.
Representatives of two other neutral
nations, Switzerland nnd Spain. In
volved as messengers for Oermany for
her penco proposals, called on Secre
tary Lansing. They listed they hsd
Just received the text of the German
note.
Within a' few hours nfter.rerelpt of
the official text or the Teuton peace
proposals, which. Incidentally, were
almost Identical with the text car
ried In press dispatches. Secretary
Lansing was directed by thn President
to dispatch It to London, Paris, retro
grud. Tokyo, und to the provisional
capitals of ltoumanln. Sorbin, and Del
glum.
Interests P. S. Handles.
Thn United States represents Oer
rrany In Ilelglum. Russia, Orest llrlt
aln, France, Japan, Serbia and Ron
mania. She represents Austro-llun-gary
In thn same countries. She rep
resents Turkey In Oreat Tlrltaln,
France, and Japan.
The Herman communication to her
enemies Is to be sent without any sug
gestions or comment by the President.
This action will completely fulfill
thn request the central empires mad
or thn United States.
In Ills Stlldv of u-IimI art Inn If an-
hn may take toward adding the weight
or mis wovornmeut'H influence In thn
mutter or furthering tho Teutonla
suggestion that pence be discussed,
the President received from Charge
tlrew, or the American embassy nt
llorlln. confidential advices tending to
explain Oermany's action and tha
spirit which prompted It
President's Mind Open.
It was stuted nn highest authority
that the President's mind Is entirely
open. He still Is undetermined. Ho
will reach no decision until he has
confidential advices rrom American
representatives at the entente allied
capitals.
One point, however, became clear
todn. This Is that however careful
the President and his advisers might
be that no move be made that might
be received unfavorably by the allied
governments, the President "Is not go
ing to overlook the slightest point" on
which he might hinge un opening for
his avowed belief that peace, when
It does come, must be permanent and
must be made permanent by some or
ganization such as a world league to
enrorce peace.
It has been suggested to him that
perhaps a statement, concise, clear,
and full delivered to the American
people und to the world, might be
the entering wedge to be adopted,
Two Main Ideas.
ir the President should decide to
make the suggested pronouncement
to tho world or America's creed us to
peace, t would Include these two
main Ideas;
America's Interest Is "only In peace
and Its future guarantees." Obvious
ly, It was explained, settlement of de
batable points such as Indemnities,
boundary lines, etc., would be regard,
ed us questions the belligerents them
selves would have solo right to pass
upon,
Expression or willingness or the
United States to become a partner In
uny feasible association of nations "to
fruaruntee territorial Integrity and fn
Itlcal Independence or nations ,large
and small."
Public Itlgbts First.
The President avowedly believes
"tho principle or public right must al
ways take precedence over Individual
Interests of separate nations, and that
thn nations or thn world must In some
way "bund themselves together to see
that right prevails as against an
sort or selfish aggression."
Such a pronouncement, with such
a creed, tho President Is said to be
lleve. would servo to notify all tho
world that this country stands tead
to assist In bringing about n lasting
peace at the propitious but not at
any other time.
Furthermore, It was pointed out,
such a pronouncement would not bo
directed to any particular nation, and,
therefore, would not bo subjected to a
flat turn down, as might greet a sug
gestion to Oermany's enemies of
mediation.
