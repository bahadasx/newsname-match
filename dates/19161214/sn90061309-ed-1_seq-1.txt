It seems to he an assured fact
that the Chicago, Burlington anil
Qiiincy Railway Company will
build u line from Monroe City to
Moberly Junction, three miles
southwest of Moberly.
Surveyors in rived in this city
Tuesday and began to survey the
route over which the new line is to
be built. C. F. Bowers, of Chicago
will be the Engineer in charge. Mr
Bowers was formerly Road Master
over this division.
He did not stale how soon the
construction work would bet in. DUt
stated that they would be here a
year.
The object of building this line,
is to secure, a short low-grade line
between Chicago and other points
east of the Mississippi River to
Kansas City. The route will closely
parallel the hue of the Missouri,
Kansas & Texas Railway, between
Monroe City and Noberly.
