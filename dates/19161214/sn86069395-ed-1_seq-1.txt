You'll find things all awry;
With Christian county full of booze
And Bourbon county dry D. J. R.

Speaking of the full things,
There's E'town full of News,
And Hardin is full of bootlegs
And bootlegs full of booze.
Hog-killing has brought bones down
to 10 to 12J cents.
Wheat dropped 11 cents Tuesday
but rjillied two cents yesterday.
Smithland had a $30,000 fire Tues
day morning, starting in a garage.
It is to be hoped that the Kaiser
really knows when he has enough.
The coal man and the overcoat man
are not worrying over this weather.
It is almost too much to hope for
that peace negotiations may be suffi
ciently advanced to admit of a Christ
mjtrucc in the trenches.
A. J. Baugh, a young soldier of
Evansville, stationed in China, killed
himself because he couldn't get out of
the army.

and says it is well enough to get rid of
all these troubles in one year.

MYSTERY STILL UNSOLVED
Several Theories Advanced
But None of Them Seem

With the identity of the strange
young woman, who died here Nov.
30, fully established, the discussion of
the mysterious case now turns to
probable theories.
One theory is that some one was
with her in the deserted school house.
The buggy tracks carry out this
theory. Her brother says it was
foreign to her nature to go out at
night alone. She was timid and
easily frightened.
Another thepry is that she attempt
ed suicide. She, denied this at the
hospital, saying she woke up with
her clothes on fire. Besides she told
H. L. Harton she thought she would
survive her burns. Shu did not
want to die.
Another theory is that she was de
mented, but every witness denied
this. She appeared at all times be

Another theory is that her

tions are being asked on all sides.

THE PROMISE OP A LASTING PEACE IS MADE
Kaiser Would Enter Into Negotiations
at Once With Entente Powers
to End the Strife.
Berlin. Dec. 13, Wireless. Germany and her allies
yesterday proposed to enter forthwith into peace negotiations.
The propositions which they will bring forward are, ac
cording to Chancellor von Bethmann-Hol'weg, appropriate
for the establishment of a lasting peace.
The Austrian, Turkish and Bulgarian governments are
making similar proposals. These proposals have been trans
mitted also to the Vatican.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg has received the rep
resentatives of the United States, Spain and Switzerland, the
nations protecting German interest in hostile foreign coun
tries. The Chancellor transmitted a note to them and asked
them to bring it to the knowledge of the hostile governments.
London, Dec. 13. The foreign of-
fice has informed the Associated Press
that it is unable to .discuss the Gcr-
man p-'ace until trfe terms have been
received. Moanwhilc the attitude of
tho British government towards pos-
siblo peace terms remains as frequent-
ly enunciated by the former premier

The establishment of independent
kingdoms in Lithuania and Poland
would be one of the factors in the
German proposal, although that part
of Poland possessed by Germany at
tho outbreak of the war would not be
included.
What adjustment would be mado
to cover the Trentino region between
Austria and Italy or any provisions'
affecting Egypt, the Suez canal, Mes
opotamia, or the gateways of control
to the Indian empire are not made
clear in German quarters here. The
Balkan situation is considered so del
icate it would have to be untangled in
