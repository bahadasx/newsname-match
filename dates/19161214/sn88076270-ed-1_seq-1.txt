Took Ten Months
To Reach America
Almost unbelievable is the story
torney W. B. Overson, Secretary of
State, Robert Lansing, the American
consul at Berlin and an unknown
number of other officials to get Mrs.
Yelen and her three sons out of Po
land and reunited with her husband
in this city.
The extraordinary difficulties can
of course air be charged to the war
conditions in Europe.
The rabbi and his wife originally
caroe from Stawiski, Russian Poland.
For a number of years they lived at
Manitowoc, Wisconsin. About five
years ago they returned to Stawiski
-to visit" friends. After remaining
about six months the rabbi returned
to America, but his wife and boys re
mained in their native city. Last
March efforts were begun by the rabbi
to have his family come to him. Since
-then the efforts of all the parties men
itoned above have been devoted to tire
task. Hundreds of letters have been
written and money has been sent
three times. None of the letters sent
to the raibbi by his wife or by the
wife to her husband reached their
destination, and only one of ths re
mittances was received by Mrs. Yelen.
The great source of difficulty was
that the oldest b©y Rueben was born
in Poland in'a district that is mw in
possession of the German empire.
Finallv the Imperial government was
prevailed upon by the department of
state of this country to waive their
claim to Rueben as a citizen, he being
now only eleven years old and of r.o
use for mlitary service. As soon as
permission was granted her to take
her children out of the country, Mrs.
Yelen sold property that they held in
Stawiski at a great sacrifice and used
the money to reach this country. Her
husband, the rabbi, did not even
known that she was on the road until
he received a telegram sent by her
from New York.
Mrs. Yelen arrived in Williston
last Friday morning and the family
reunion was an exceedingly happy
one.

SCHOOLS "AT HOME" ALL AF
TERNOON MONTAVILLE
FLOWERS IN EVENING
On Tuesday afternoon of next
week the schools of the city will be
,:at
home'' in an informal way to all
parents and friends of the school
children.
No special programs are being
presented, nor is there on display in
these various rooms any special ex
hibit of their work. The work of
the afternoon will be conducted much
as in the ordinary manner, for it is
believed that the usual every day
work of school pupils will prove of a
high degree of interest. It is serious
ly hoped that every father and moth
er will take occasion to visit every
department where they may have
children in school. And of course all
interested in the schools are welcomed
whether immediately interested in
any particular or not.
Special High School Program
In the high school regular work will
be conducted until three o'clock when
the high school will assemble in the
new auditorium and a special Christ
mas program will be presented. A
cordial invitation is extended by the
high school for both the class work
and the program.
Exhibit of School Work
At four o'clock the new auditorium
will be opened againfto present var
ious forms of "tne school work thus
far completed. This is not work made
up for premiums or especially for
the exhibit, but shows the regular
Christmas sewing of the Domestic
Art department, some of the manual
training work, various forms of the
work in drawing and painting, to
gether with some types of work done
in various grades. Light refresh
ments will be served by the Domestic
Science department during the ex
hibit hours, from four to six.
Montaville Flowers
At eight o'clock* the new school
auditorium is again opened when
Montaville Flowers will present the
immortal story of Christmas cheer,
Dickens' Christmas Carol. Mr. Flow
ers is perhaps one of the most effec
tive speakers that will appear in the
state during: the year. He has ap
peared on the lecture courses of most
colleges and universities in the Uni^
ted States. An admission fee of fifty
cents is charged for the evening en
tertainment. It is hoped that the ad
vance sale will make possible the ad
mission of high school pupils with
out charge. The new auditorium will
seat a surprisingly large audience.
Summary
1:30 to 4:00—Regular class work in
aTl schools.
3 -00 to 4:00—Special Christmas
program in auditorium.

6ERMANY MAKES
PEACE PROPOSAL
UNITED STATES, SPAIN AND
SWITZERLAND ASK TO TRANS
MIT OFFER TO ALLIES
Terms Offered Not Known—Various
Motives Assigned— Restoration
Is Hinted At
Berlin, Dec. 12.—(Wireless to Say
ville).—Germany and her allies to
day proposed to enter forthwith into
peace negotiations. The proposals
nave been transmitted to tne repre
sentatives of the United States, Spain
and Switzerland and also the Vatican.
The following announcement was
given out today by the semi-official
Overseas Agency:
"The chancellor (Von Bethmann
Hollweg) this morning received one
after another the representatives of
the United States of America and
Spain and Switzerland, that is, of the
states protecting German interests in
hostile foreign countries. The chan
cellor transmitted to them a note and
asked them to bring it to the knowl
edge of the hostile governments. The
note will be read today in the Reich
stag by the chancellor.
"In the note the four allied (cen
tral) powers proposed to enter forth
with on peace negotiations. The
proposition which they bring for such
negotiations are, according to their
firm belief, appropriate for the es
tablishment of a lasting peace.
"The governments at Vienna, Con
stantinople and Sofia transmitted
identical notes and also communicated
with the Holy See and all other
powers."
Wilson Is Silent
Washington, Dec. 12.—News that
Germany and her allies were about
to enter upon peace negotiations was
sent immediately to President Wilson.
Speaking for the president, Secre
tary Tumulty said he was deeply in
terested, but could not make any
comments until he learned what re
ception the proposals receive from
th eEntente Allies.
London. Dec. 12.—A Central News
dispatch from Amsterdam says it is
announced officially in Berlin that
Emperor William has notified his
commanding generals of German's
peace offer, and has informed them
that it is still uncertain whether the
offer will be accepted. Until that un
certainty is ended, the message says,
they are to fight on.
The message says:
"Soldiers: In agreement with the
sovereigns of my allies and with the
consciousness of victory, I have made
an offer of peace to the enemy.
Whether it will be accepted is still
uncertain. Until that moment ar
rives you .will fight on."'
Restoration of Belgium
Washington, Dec. 12—Advices from
Berlin to the German embassy indi
cate that Germany's peace terms, in
general measure, propose the restora
tion of the status quo before the war
with the exception of the establish
ment of independent kingdoms of
Poland and Lithuania.
They are understood to propose
the complete restoration of the oc
cupied portion of Belgium and France
in return for Germany's captured
colonies and to dispose of the Balkan
situation because of its extreme com
plicated danger, in the peace con
ference.
Germany's Native
Washington, Dec. 12.—In trans
mitting the note of the Teutonic al
lies suggesting peace negotiations it
was §tated officially that the United
Sates probably will follow the prac
tice in such cases and not make pub
lic the terms of the peace proposals.
They would be known to President
Wilson, however, who would exam
ine them to determine whether they
should be accompanied by any word
from this government.
Peace proposals probably will be
discussed at the regular meeting of
the cabinet this afternoon.
Discussion in diplomatic circles
turned to the question of Germany's
motive in making the suggestion at
this time. Despite rumors current
for some time and officially denied,
that peace proposals were soon to be
made, the announcement came gen
erally as a surprise.
One prevailing opinion was that the
German allies had brought out their
peace offer at this time with the ex
pectation of making terms which
might be acceptable to the allies of
England and in effect might possibly

ONLY WASHINGTON
AND OREGON AHEAD
Ol STATE GROWING RAPIDLY
IX POPULATION—FEDERAL
ESTIMATE 752,260
Of the eight other states in the
northwesterly portion of the Uniicd
States only* two, Washington and
Oregon, now lead North Dakota in
population. The six in the rear are
South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming,
Idaho, Utah and Nevada.
North Dakota is camping on Ore
gon's trail and is now less than 100,
000 behind that state in population,
the latest estimates of the United
States bureau of the census show.
The Flickertail state, the census bu
reau guesses, now has 752,260 people,
while Oregon has 848,806. Six years
ago, when the last federal decennial
censjs was taken, North Dakota had
577,'56 people in 1915, a state cen
s'"! i'sve North Dakota 636,956 the
fa'co that approximately 120,000 votes
were cast in the recent general elec
tion, would indicate that the census
department's present estimate for
North Dakota is quite conservative.
Maintaining Record
North Dakota is maintaining its
record for speed. In 1860 all of Da
kota territory numbered 4,837 peo
ple in 1870, that part of the terri
tory now embraced in North Dakota,
had a population of 2,405 the end of
the following decade found 36,909
people, an increase of 1,437 per
cent. In 1890, the federal census re
ported 182,719 people, a gain of 395.1
per cent over the previous decade. In
1900, the federal census gave North
Dakota 319,146, an increase of 74.7
per cent, and in 1910 the population
of 577,056 showed a gain of 80 per
cent over the last decade. The gain
made in the last six years is 34 per
cent, or at the rate of 60 per cent for
the decade.
North Dakota leads South Dakota
in the latest federal estimate by about
50.000 it has 300,000 more people
than Montana, with 466,214 more
than 300,000 more than Idaho, with
430,881, and Utah, with 438,974.
North Dakota is five times as popu
lous as Wyoming, with 182,264.
If the present rate of increase is
maintained, North Dakota will easily
have a million people in 1920. A 60
per cent gain for the decade would
give the state 923,289 people in 1920,
and everyone is confident that the im
migration movement during the nert
few years will be the greatest in the
history of the state and that the in
crease for the ensuing four years will
far outstrip that of the past six.

Eastgate on Soil
"In order to know agriculture as
we should know it, we must go out
and study Nature," said J. E. East
gate of Larimore speaking upon "The
Care of our Soils" Tuesday afternoon.
"God Almighty was the first farmer
and his methods have never been im
proved on. If you go out and study
a bit of virgin sod you will find that
He subsoils, rotates crops and fer
tilizes His fields. These are the three
essential things necessary to preserve
the productiveness of the soil."
Mr. Eastgate said in part: We
have been for four hundred years a
nation of land skimmers. As soon as
we have exhausted the fertility of one
section of the country, we have moved
westward until now we are on the
last lap, and in fact are beginning to
beat backwards over the territory
already worked. Soils that used to
produce bountiful crops, today will
not give us a decent crop of wheat.
An analysis of the soil of a field that
had been tilled for thirty years was
recently taken and this showed ,830
pounds of nitrogen per acre in a
depth of 6 1-2 inches from the sur
face. Near this field a field of vir
gin prairie was found to contain
14.000 pounds of nitrogen to the acre.
The cultivated field does not produce
a paying crop any more, and if a man
was smart enough in thirty more
years he could have that field a bar
ren waste. Nature believes in sub
soiling, in crop rotation—only the ro
tation is simultaneous—on any va
riety of soil you can find from one to
fifteen varieties of plants—and in
fertilization. Now we come along
and go against every law of nature
and then complain because the coun
try is changing, the climate is chang
ing and things are not what they used
to be. We grow one crop year after
year and then wonder that the soil
doesn't produce the crops it used to.
The straw which nature would use
as a fertilizer we thresh in one pile
an dthen burn. Whenever you see a
man touch a match to a strawpile you
can just put this down in your hat
band, that that man has more acres
to farm than he has brains to farm
with.
$1600 in an Acre
A model crop rotation—and I use
this simply as an illustration—would
be something like this: wheat, corn,
grass, pasture, etc. If you are go
ing to hog off your corn field plant
something that will get ripe if you
want it for winter feed plant corn
that will grow high. Next seed the
field to grass—either sweet clover or
some of the native grasses—with a
nurse crop of wheat. The second
year cut for hay, and the third year
use for pasture. This will help fer
tilize the land. You can also fer
tilize part of the field while the rest
is being used as pasture. One load
of manure per acre for every inch of
rainfall is the general rule. This
would mean around Williston 7 or 8
loads per acre. It is necessary that
we follow some such rotation as I
have outlined if we would maintain
the fertility of our soil. One crop
farming tends to pulverize and dry
out the ton so that it will blow easily.
Chemists have found that in the top
8 inches of soil, there is about $1600
worth of fertility an acre. Half an
inch cut off the surface of a man's
field would mean a loss of $100 an
acre—not to the owner perhaps, but
to posterity. Let us give the land a
square deal, give our people a square
deal and the people that are to come
after us. We cannot expect to be a
great people or a great state when
our land gets impoverished, and it
doesn't make any difference what kind
of a crop we grow, if we keep at it

Wenz on Alfalfa
In the afternoon M. B. Johnson,
county agent of McKenzie county
was not present, and Alfred Went
filled in the time with a discussion of
the growth and culture of alfalfa.
Among other things he stated that
row alfalfa produced much better re
sults than broadcast sown alfalfa,
especially in a dry climate. Discuss
ing the use of sweet clover, Mr. Wenz
said that if sweet clover is to be used,
it must be used largely for pasture
for hogs or cattle or for rotation and
that farmers should depend more on
alfalfa for hay. It will grow any
where and will seed itself usually.
Contrary to the opinion of many cat
tle, horses and hogs are very fond'
of sweet clover especially when the
leaves are young and tender. In many
sections of the country people pre-
fer the yellow biennial clover to the
white sweet clover because it is not
so woody and therefore better for
hay. The yellow annual clover is
undesirable, and in buying seed one
should be very careful to get th«
biennial kind.
Domestic Topics
Miss Ida Ratzlaff of the State A.
C., who had been scheduled to speak
to the women, addressed the meeting,
taking as her topic "The Improve
ment of Farm Homes." "This is not
a matter of means" she said, "be
cause frequently many of the im
provements cost very little money.
We should make our home a com
fortable convenient place to live in
if for no other reason than just to
become more efficient for our work.
An attractive comfortable home does
more to keep the children on the farm
than anything else.''
Miss Ratzlaff suggested the follow
ing as some of the things that make
for comfort and convenience on the
farm. A cistern, probably made of
cement and ocntaining a filter, is one
of the first things to get. Following
this shopld come running water,
which admits of the possibility of a
kitchen sink, bath, toilet, laundry
tubs, etc. By having a 200 to 500
gallon pressure tank at a cost of $65
to .$75, running water is easily pos
sible. The prices charged for lx
res are usually exhorbitant. Good
fixtures can be obtained for the fol
lowing prices: bath tub, $22 to $25
sink $13 to $15 toilet^ $22 to $26r.
and hot water tank about $10.
Sanitary disposal of the sewage is
necessary to good health, and this
should come after a house is equipped
with running water. Miss RatzlafT
recommended running the sewage
into a septic tank rather than into a
cess pool because a cess pool merely
stores up the sewage whereas a chem
ical change takes place in a septic
tank that renders the sewage harm
less. The cost of a septic tank
varies from $10 to $15. Miss Ratz
laff illustrated her talk by means of
charts picturing an ideal plumbing.'
system, etc.
Potato Marketing
Discussing the subject of Potato1'
Marketing this morning, Jas E. Boyle
of the Fargo A. C. said in part:
"Before we condemn the middle^
men we must realize that they do US'
a great deal of service. It would take
about three years for a man to es-
tablish a market for his goods in
Kansas City or St. Louis, whereas the
commission men are in touch
consumers all over the country and
are able to bring consumer and pro
ducer together at a minimum cost.
North Dakota potatoes are already
favorably known in the markets, and
as soon as the industry becomes or
ganized through the newly formed
Potato Growers Association and5
through local associations, North Da
kota potatoes can be made to conform=
to a standard that will command top
prices and compete favorably with
Colorado and Idaho potatoes."
Mr. Boyle also stated that the mid
dlemen were honest as a rule and
that a great deal of the shrinkage in
transit was due to field frost which
could not be detected before ship
ment or to frost in transit due to tne •.
length of time on the road,, the
severiy of the weather and the ship
pers' failure to provide against frost.
Potatoes of uniform size ana shape,,
free from dirt and snipped in new
sacks, bring the highest prices.
In discussing, Potato Growing, Mr.
Eastgate said that this was only one
more thing added to diversified farm
ing and that in order to make a suc
cess of it it is necessary to keep set
it year after year. Instead of put
ting potatoes on the poorest ground
on the farm one should put them on
the best and should prepare the
ground for potatoes rather than use
the potatoes to get the weeds out of
the land for some other crop. He
himself plants potatoes on pasture
land, plowed deep( Potatoes must—
be planted early enough so that they
will get ripe before frost. One or
