Be Guilty if He Did Not Cry Out
to His Country.
PARIS, Dec. 13.—(8:45 p. m.)—The
chamber of deputies by a vote of 314 to
165 this evening adopted a resolution
of confidence in the new government.
Premier Briand, during the session,
delivered a speech on the German im
perial chancellor's peace proposal in
which he warned the country to be
ware of Prance's enemies. He added
that Prance would not do less in the
the premises than the other members
of the allied conference.
"I have the duty to place my coun
try on guard ogalns possible poison
ing," said M. Briand, amid applause.
"When a country arms itself to the
teeth, when it seizes men everywhere
in violation of the law of nations and
enforces labor upon them, I should be
guilty If I did not cry out to my coun
try: 'Look out; take care.'
"I have the right in the first place
to say to our enemies for the hun
dredth time: 'The blood is on your
hands not upon ours.' Not that 1 doubt
the clear-sightedness of my country,
but in the face of these attempts to
spread dissension among the allies I
exclaim: 'The French republic will not
do less than the convention.' "
The chamber held a large number of
deputies who desired to witness the
first appearance of the new cabinet.
M. Briand instead of reading the decla
ration of the program of the reorgan
ized ministry, outlined it extemporane
ously. The premier said that in sec
ret session most delicate questions had
been considered. The socialists in
terrupted the speaker with cries of
"no,'' but Paul Deschamel, president
of the chamber, soon succeeded in re
storing order. M. Briand then con
tinued:
"The government is ready for all
discussions and explanations."
He referred to the adoption by the i
chamber of a resolution demanding a |
reorganization in the conduct of the
war, the constitution of a war com
mittoe and modifications in the high
command. He said the war commit
tee would sit permanently and that it
would increase the production of war
necessities.
"No one can say that I have ever
been unduly optimistic," said M.
Briand. "But today, however, more
than ever, we must have the convic
tion that victory is certain.
"In a war such as this, In which
entire nations confront each other, de
cisive results cannot be attained rap
idly. It is true that the valiant Ru
manians have bent under the first
shock, but let us examine the facts
more closely. The Rumanian army
has not been destroyed; It has been
reorganized with the help of the gal
lant Russian armies. Tomorrow a new
front of from 250 to 300 miles will
be formed down there for the eastern
question Is far from being settled. And
If the enemy armies now fighting
against Rumania were not held there
you must admit they would be em
ployed on some other front."
The president of the chamber read
a number of interpellations, whereupon
Premier Briand announced he would
reply only to interpellations concern
ing the constitution of the cabinet and
the direction of the war, adding that
he submitted to the chamber a ques
tion of confidence.
Georges Leygues denounced the lack
of co-ordination by the allies In
Greece and expressed astonishment
that the premier refused questions he
had asked. Briand explained that It
was impossible to answer certain ques
tions while negotiations were going on.
Capt. Andre Tardieu also criticised
the policy of the entente in Greece
and the re-organization of the high
command. Deputies Violette and
Goudc criticised the new cabinet and
Premier Brland's policy, while Admiral

German submarine which has re
turned to its base after 55 days
at sea without entering harbor
or receiving outside assistance

The Caledonia attempted to ram

While in the city Rev. Donaldson

ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
The announcement by the Teutonic
allies of their readiness to discuss
peace with the entente allies continues
the absorbing feature In the war
news. As yet, however, no announce
ment has been vouchsafed as to
the basis on which they desir^ to at
tempt to bring an end to the, war.
Neither has there come from any of
the entente countries any official an
nouncement as to the attitude they
propose to take with regard to the
proposal.
Meantime the conquest of Rumania
by the Teutonic allies continues. All
aiong the front the Rumanians are in
retreat northeastward and the Ninth
German army is nearing the important
railroad junction town of Buzeu.
In the Carpathians and along the
Moldavian frontier the Russians and
Germans are still at grips with the
Russians the aggressors at most
points. There Is little if aay change
In the situation in these regions, how
ever.
Heavy artillery fighting is in prog
ress northwest of Monastir, Serbia.
Otherwise calm prevails. A new fea
ture in the Balkan situation is a re
port from Sofia that 6,000 Albanians
have defeated a force of Italians near
Pasneslna, Epirius, the Italians fieeing.

SUNSHINE THEN RAIN. I
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY
PRANCE, Dec.—(Via London, 8:40 p.
m.)—(From a staff correspondent of
the Associated Press.)—Several hours
of glorious December sunshine this
morning brought glad relief from a
week of dreary days, and sent scores
of airplanes and observation balloons
aloft and quickened the pulse of the
entire British army organization on |
the western front. But before the
dayllBht had ended leaden clouds had
again shut In, the rain had begun to
fall and there was a somewhat gloomy
return to the wintry, weather-beaten
warfare.
Heavy sheepskin and leather coats
and jackets have been issued to the
British troops and warm and dry rest
billets provided for those in the spe
cial reserve positions.
Best of all however, Tommy in the
front line gets five hot meals daily.
There is breakfast at 7; dinner at
12; tea at 5 and soup or stew at
9 and again at 2 o'clock in the morn
ing.
Prom reports received from German
prisoners and observations made dur
ing raids the British have discovered
that conditions on the German front
are very different. Along most of the
new lines formed by the battle of the
Somme the German front trenches are
merely a broken stretch of linked-up
shell holes with no deep ilugouts and
only a few Improvised hiding holes,
where two or three men can take
shelter from the shrapnel
British reports from the Somme sec
tion say the German communication
trenches are impassable from mud and
the shelling of the British guns, so
that all the carrying of supplies and
the bringing up of reliefs have to
take over the open, without cover of
any kind. Often the shells jr bombs

CONSIDERABLE TIME WILL
ELAPSE BEFORE ALLIES WILL
REPLY TO PEaViE TERMS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.—President
Wilson is giving serious considera
tion to the possibility that any ex
change?; of viewB that may follow
the peace proposals of the central pow
ers to the entente allies may develop
an opportunity to br^ing forward the
suggestion for a league of nations to.lish
enforce permanent peace. He has
reached no decision, however, as to
tlie course to be followed by the llni
ted States and probably will not pend
j n g tbe arrival of the official cable
gram containing the communication
" " ,
handed Charge Grew by the German
government.
The cablegram hud not been re
ceived at the state department and in
the meantime all officials were most
reticent about discussing the situa
Hon. It is understood that the com
mUnication will be transmitted prompt
l.v',to the entente governments regard
of what attitude may be adopted
by the United States, and for this reti
son there is a general belief that any
steps taken by the United States on
, its owh account will come after formal
; delivery of the proposals from one
( set of belligerents to the other,
It is realized that the American
| course probably must be guided very
I largely by the reception given the
I Teutonic offer in the entente coun
IN'*tries, although it is regarded as cer
tain that either informally or formally,
quietly or publicly, the government
here will find a way of displaying its
interest in the restoration of peace.
Most officials think that a consid
erable time will olapse after the com
munication is delivered before a for
mal reply Is framed by the allies and
| that , In the meantime a very clear
idea of what that reply is to be and
how any attempt at mediation by the
neutrals would be viewed will be
gained through diplomatic channels.
The trend of public opinion in Great
Britain, Prance and Russia is being
followed closely, and the Americai
ambassadors in those countries have
countries have been instructed to for
ward promptly any available indiea
tion of official views.
President Wilson had only one con
ference on the subject today and that
was with Col. E. M. Houso, his per
sonal friend and adviser. It was sug
gested during the day that the presi
dent might discuss the situation in
general te^ms before the annual con
ference of governors here tomorrow,
but Tie had not decided tonight wheth
er he would accept an Invitation to
address tlie governors and had given
no indication of what might be the sub
ject if he did speak.
In Teutonic diplomatic quarters It
was reiterated tonight that eGrmuny
expects neutrals, especially those in
Europe, to do everything possible to
bring about at least a discussion of
peace terms.
CHAMBERLAIN'8 IDEA.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.—Senator
Chamberlain, democrat, of Oregon, was
a White House caller late today. He
said afterward that he thought the
American government should back up
the peace proposals of the central
Dowers by mediatory offers of Its own.
He said ho had not discussed the sub
ject with the president. Opinions
among senators differ, he said.

Two Currents Discerned
Relative to Neutrality
of the United States.

Judging by the Rules of Neutrality the
United States Intentionally Favors
Great Britain in an Almost Out
spoken Fashion, According to a Por
tion of the People In Germany;
Others Take the View That the
United States Is Neutral In Spirit
and Action—Germany Will Keep
Promise Made to President.
BERLIN, Dec. 13. (By wireless to
Sayville.l Dr. Alfred Zimmerman,
secretary for foreign affairs, discussed
today with a member of the staff of
tin! Overseas News Agency the Im
pression created in Germany by the
attitude of the United States toward
Germany and Great Britain as out
lined in the Associated Press Wash
ing! on dispatch of November III. Zim

"As to tlie impression created: Al
most since the beginning of the war
two currents of opinion eould lie dis
cerned in Germany. Judging by tlie
rules of neutrality the United States
intentionally favored Great Britain In
an almost outspoken fashion, accord
ing to some; others took the view
Hint the United Stales was neutral in
spirit and action. This discussion was
re-opened by the dispatch in question.
The parties and newspapers that did
not believe that America was observ
ing strict neutrality accepted the dis
patch us confirmation of their opinion
und to the others the news came as a
shock.
"In order to understand this effect
one lias only to recall the large num
ber of facts which have been before
the eyes of the German public during
the last few years. England has re
peatedly announced that all English
ships ought to lm ready to destroy
German submarines wherever they
find them. This lias been publicly pro
claimed as well by private us by of
ficial persons in England. Quito re
cently Lord Cecil, in the British par
liament, gave expression to this view:
"The London Times of Nov. 21 pub
lished a letter from a well known
member of parliament and shipowner
(Robert P.) Houston, und promising to
every foreign-horn captain a prize of
2,000 pounds sterling who with an Eng
man submarine. Houston on Ibis occa
sion added that English sailors ought
to return to the methods of Hawkins
and Drake, or should imitate the ex
ample set by Nelson in the Copen
hagen case—they ought to take the
sea law Into tlieir own hands. Hons
ton was fully conscious that ho advo
cated and advised actloim contrary to
the law of nation.
"We further know that hostile sub
marines have attacked and In some
cases have sunk German merchantmen
without the slightest warning. Thus
were sunk the German steamers Burge
melster Votmelle, Dorltz, the Elbe and
llollandia. They were till attacked by
enemy submarines with urtillery or
torpedoes without the shadow of a
warning.
"Germany, on the other hand, has
promised the United States to carry
on submarine warfare according to
the international rules of cruiser war
fare."
I)r. Zimmerman at this moment in
terrupted Ills conversation, walked
through Ills office, stopped and, In the
face of the interviewer, said to his
clerk in an energetic manner:
"This promise will have to he
kept.''
He then continued:
"The orders to the commanders of
our submarines are clear and strict in
this direction. I can affirm with abso
lute certainty that no German subma
rine lias intentionally attacked a mer
chant ship without warning and with
out giving all on board ample time and
opportunity for rescue.
"These are the facts of the case.
We are animated by the best of feel
ings toward everybody. But we are
fighting for tlie life and future of our
nation. Of course we are cut off
from the greater part of tlie com
munications of tlie outer world, espe
cially with the United States. Our
enemies use tlie cables,, the malls
and the spoken word in order to plead
their case before the whole world.
But oilier nations ought to hear our
voice, our grievances. I myself, with
these words, only mean to explain
the reasons for tlie present popular
feeling in Germany, and I feel sure
that it will be appreciated everywhere
by all fair-minded people.
"The situation is that Germany and
her allies are surrounded by enemies
and that Germany lias victoriously car
ried the war on all fronts beyond the
limits of Germany. Popular feeling in
Germany is that our enemies, unablo
to win victory on the battlefield, will
try to win by creating a wrong im
pression about Germany's intention
aifd Germany's actions in the rest of
tlie world where Germany's voice can
onlv seldom be heard.
"They will try to persuade the world
that in the case of submarines and in
other cases Germany will disregard
her given word while, they themselves,
in fact, have abrogated tlie laws of na
tions and do themselves wliat they

lence of unemployment lias been
caused by the English policy of Iso
lation which lias cut off Belgian Indus
try from the Importation of raw mate
rial and tlie exportation of manufac
tured goods and has thus brought tlie
greater part of Belgian industry to a
standstill.
"By this meusuro almost half of
the workingmen in Belgian factories
numbering altogether, in round num
bers, to 1,200,000, were deprived of
the possibility or earning a living, and
many more than half u million Bel
gians, who formerly supported them
selves by industrial work were made
dependent upon public relief. Adding
tin- members of tlieir families this
number Is increased three,-fold or, lu
round figures, 1,500,000 persons.
"Prom the standpoint of the Belgian
economic, right, upon which the un

also from the standpoint of public or

persons enjoying public relief and de

"Belgian Industries being in a de
pressed condition, it was impossible
to procure for all tlie unemployed
work, or at least proper emplo/niput
within Belgium Itself. The only thing
possible, therefore, was to ussign them
to work in Germany where a large
number of Belgian workingmen had
already voluntarily accepted work,
were well fed, were receiving high
wages and were enjoying far-reaching
liberty of movement. For those work
ingmen. however, that did not support
their families, coercive labor was
used.
"These measures are completely in
accordance with international law, for
according to The Hague convention re
