hr States in the union have
several raid meetings a year and
they are attended by between
two and three thousand people
and in no state in the union are
people more alive to the road
movement than in Kentucky,
and there is no reason why the
meeting at Bowling Green should
not be attended by at least three
thousand people. Effort are now
being made to induce the rail
roads throughout the state to
give reduced rates aad it is be
lieved that such will be done.
The meeting is held at a time
cf the year when no road work
is being done and no working
time will be lost by those inter
ested in road building and it is
earnestly hoped that all County
Officials, all Contractors and all
citizens interested in road build
ing will make a special effort to
attend the meeting.
