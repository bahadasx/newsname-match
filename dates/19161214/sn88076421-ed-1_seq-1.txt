BIG INITIATION
Large Class Given Degrees Sunday
Followed by Banquet and Toasts
in the Evening.
A large class was initiated by the
Minot Council No. 1150, Knights of
Columbus, Sunday. The degree work
was given at the Elks' Home and in
the evening the Knights sat down to a
splendid banquet served in the dining
room at the St. Leo's Catholic church
by the Daughters of Isabella. The
menu consisted of roast young turkey
and other delicacies.
At the conclusion of the banquet,
the following program was rendered,
John J. Coyle acting as toastmaster
in a very capable manner:
Invocation, Rev. S. J. Arsenault.
The Church and the State—Rt. Rev.
Bishop Wehrle.
Vocal Solo—Clary Monoly.
Unity—Francis Murphy.
Charity—R. H. Grace.
Violin Solo—Signor A. Petrucci.
Loyalty—Thomas B. Murphy.
Vocal Solo—Clary Monoly.
Benediction—Bishop Wehrle.
During the banquet, an orchestra
played.
The local council was organized
Sept. 9, 1906, with 23 charter mem­
bers. The membership has grown into
the hundreds, including many promi­
nent citizens from all sections of
northwestern North Dakota.
Dr. Lang Returns From Aunt's Fun­
eral.
Dr. Roy C. Lang returned the latter
part of last week from Pekin, N. D.,
where he attended the funeral of Mrs.
P. O. Engstad, wife of the county
treasurer of Nelson county. Mrs. En
stad had been taken to the hospital at
Northwood, N. D., for an operation
for gall stones and it was believed that
she was recovering nicely when she
suffered an attack of heart failure,
dying almost instantly.
The funeral was held from the home
and from the Sheyenne church at Pe­
kin. The floral tributes were the most
numerous ever seen at a funeral in
that city, tokens of the high esteem
in which the deceased was held byjjer
many friends.
REUCS OF BYGONE DAYS
Copies of Early Minot Newspapers
Contain Items of Interest to Old
Settlers—Minot Then Cow Town
Ed Kelley brot to this office two rel­
ics of by-gone days, a copy of Geo. W.
Wilson's Ward County Reporter dated
July 16, 1897, and a copy of Marshall
McClure's Minot Optic dated May 23,
1901.
The papers are both interesting to
old timers and were shown at the
meeting of the Ward County Old Set­
tlers' Association this week. In the
editorial column Mr. Wilson told why
Japan objected to this country's an­
nexing Hawaii. General Weyler
wanted two hundred million dollars
and 200,000 men, hoping to put the
Cubans to rout. The United States
owned 600,000,000 acres of unoccupied
land. President McKinley was pre­
paring to send his message to Con­
gress. Major Edwards was still sit­
ting under the provertrial plum tree at
Washington. The Minesota state
board of pardons had refused to par
don the Younger boys.
The Ward county board of equaliza­
tion consisted of W. L. Millar, Carl
Torbenson, M. S. Williams, C. C. C.
Willis and Chas. Larson, who were
also county commissioners. In looking
over the bills filed against the county
we notice that the following were in
business in Minot: D. MoColman
W. E. Mansfield, druggist Strain
Bros., P. P. Lee and Frank & Fau
chald, merchants Peter Fugelso was
assessor for the 3rd district Dr.
Crokat was coroner and C. A. Johnson
county superintendent of schools.
Dr. Belyea was a practicing phy­
sician, there being only two in Minot
then. T. P. Kulaas conducted a lum­
ber yard. James Johnson and C. Aur
land were two of the few attorneys
here in those days. C. C. Montgom­
ery was the village blacksmith. J.
W. Rode conducted a jewelry store. A.
S. Blakey ran the Palace Drug store,
and advertised "pure soda run from
an arctic fountain." Minot didn't
have any automobile dealers then
Geo. McFadden ran the barber shop
and advertised "sea foams." M. J.
Barrett was register of the land of
fice. J. C. Marcy, who long ago went
to his reward, was a practicing attor­
ney. A. C. Nedrud was auditor of
Ward county. Neil McDermid, county
treasurer, advertised plenty of money
on hand to pay all county warrants.
E. D. Kelley was Chancellor Com
mander of the K. P. Lodge. Martin
Jacobson and Bro. advertised lawn
croquet sets. The readers were told
that at "John Ehr's was the place to
buy meats." Guy Frank had just
been appointed postmaster of Minot'.
J. C. Hoff, a Minot merchant, stated
that a tailor would occupy a portion
of his store and the paper remarked
that Minot needed a tailor. Martin
Jacobson announced an increase in the
aale of saddles, which indicated that
the ranges were filling up with cattle
vifi again. Cards were out announcing
the marriage of Rev. E. I. Strom to
Miss Helen Nedrud. Major, Murphy
{had delivered an address at the Dev
ils Lake Chautauqua and was quite a
speaker, even in those days. "Monkey"
Johnson and Otto Waitz trimmed
whiskers at the Great Northern bar­
ber shop. 0. N. Cleven was proprie­
tor of the City Dray line and adver­
tised that he handled everything with
care. John Strommen and Lawrence
Huseby of the Minot Dray Line ad­
vertised draying done with dispatch.
Jarvey Tompkins, who was running a
meat market, had fallen from a step
ladder, crushing three of his fingers.
Uncle Dan Conan of Burlington gave a
recipe for "confidence pudding" com­
prising "three gallons of confidence, a
peck of international agreement, one
quart of gold standard, seven table
spoonfuls of prosperity, two quarts of
sound money, a pound of protection
boil it all with Clevelandism for 12
months and eat while hot."
In the Optic we found a good many
interesting items. Jos. Roach had re­
turned from Minneapolis with a car
load of registered bulls to sell at cost.
Marshall McClure published an inter­
esting editorial on "Science and Alco­
hol." Minot had a ball team made up
of John and A. E. Wallace, Shuster,
K. E. Leighton, now our judge, Mc
Kone, Martin, Wills, Wattz and Col­
lier. The team had beaten Kenmare
15 to 11. Art Waller, now of the
county superintendent's office, played
with the Kenmare team. A son had
been born to Mr. and Mrs. A. J.
Brunner. Doc. Windell, who estab­
lished quite a reputation as a "saw­
bones." had just come to Minot. Joe
LaPorte, a clothier, who later was
killed by a G. N. train, praised the
Leland hotel. Ed Kelley had just
bought a new shirt waist.

Three Minot Autos Lost in Storm
Three auto loads of people enroute
from the Berthold reservation to Mi­
not were lost in the storm of last week
and narrowly escaped serious conse­
quences. The three parties met on the
prairie and two cars were abandoned,
the seven attempting to continue the
journey in one auto. Suffering from
cold and exposure, they decided at
nightfall to build a prairie fire. It was
then a light was sighted and following
the welcome gleagi the travelers
reached a farm home. In the morn­
ing they discovered that they had
spent hours going one mile the night
•before. In the party were F. F. Paul­
sen, saleman for the Minot Auto com­
pany E. C. Malm of the Aultman
Taylor company C. H. Withers of the
Dakota Motor Sales company, all of
Minot I. T. Zook and son of Surrey,
Mrs. Anderson of Norwich and a
homesteader near Van Hook, whose
name was not learned.
John Ehr Will Visit Florida.
John Ehr, who attended the stock
show in Chicago, is spending the week
at Waterloo, la., visiting his mother,
who is 90 years of age. His daughter,
Miss Katie Ehr, is visiting with the
Misses Sinkler and Doris Kemper in
Chicago. Mr. Ehr and daughter will
leave shortly for Florida to spend a
portion of the Winter.
BACON MADE HIT IN CHICAGO
Miiiot Man Advertised Minot and the
Northwest at National Live Stock
Show—Farniers Learned Much.
C. M. Christenson, from Freedom
township, who returned from the nat­
ional live stock show at Chicago, tells
the Independent some interesting
things about the big show. He says
the North Dakotans received a great
deal of advertising. The daily papers
announced that the bachelors looking
for wives would pass thru the streets
in autos at a certain hour and when
the auto parade was held, the streets
were lined for blocks with women. He
didn't say whether any of the married
men were mistaken for bachelors or
not.

to be entertained in two sections.
Mr. Christenson said that A. F. Ba­
con, of Minot, was on the job every
minute and was about the most con­
spicuous figure in Chicago. He had
his force of men billing the Windy
City and everywhere the farmers
went. Bacon had been there ahead of
them and tacked up the big signs,
"Why Not Minot?" He broke into the
biggest hotels, placed the signs on
every pillar and column and 'tis said
that he even hung 'em on the tomb
stones in the cemeteries. Those peo­
ple down in Chicago will remember
Bacon—and Minot—for a long time.
Mr. Christenson says the champion
Shorthorn bull was sold to a Texan
for $15,000. Mr. Christenson met in

TRADED N. D. LAND
FOR WILD HORSES
Hettinger Man Let Go of $3,300 in
Trade for Horses Which Even Ex­
pert Cowboys Dishonor.
Omaha, Dec. 12.—W. W. Middleton,
of Kansas City, a barber, testifying
for the government in the suit against
the Omaha Land and Investment com­
pany for use of the mails to defraud
in sales of wild horses in Coconine
county, Ariz., today asserted he would
have had more success catching deer
than the wild horses he had purchased.
H. B. Halvorson, of Hettinger, who
testified to having lost North Dakota
land worth $3,300 in purchase of wild
horses, said:
"Expert cowboys in Coconine county
refused to catch the horses for $30 a
head."
When he complained to A. O. Perry,
of Omaha, one of the defendants thru
whom he purchased the horses, Hal
verson said Perry wrote him as fol­
lows:
"Find another fellow like yourself
and trade your horses to him. Just
keep quiet, tell no one your troubles
and get to trading. TTiat's what I
done and come out all right."
The government alleges the 42 men
indicted secured approximately $1,
000,000 from the sales of wild horses.
New Architect for Minot.
A. Fraser, the architectural engi­
neer who came to Minot over a year
ago to supervise the erection of the
Parker hotel, has opened an office for
the practice of architecture in the new
Anderson building here. Mr. Fraser,
who came from the Paul Kalman Co.,
St. Paul, reinforced concrete engi­
neers, has a broad experience in the
construction of modern buildings and
his special line is the modern skeleton
or cage constructed building of fire­
proof materials. Mr. Fraser has a con­
siderable amount of work in hand for
1917, including the new four story
block to be constructed by Julius Fau
chald, corner East Central Ave. and

Mr. Christenson says that the farm­
ers learned a great deal about the
stock business by visiting the show.
"We have not been producing the
right kind of stuff," he said. "We
learned that when we do, the buyers
will pay the price. They want uniform

were advised to make haste slowly
and work into it.
JUSTICE-ELECT TO TAKE
OFFICE IN JANUARY
Provisional Court Decides Against
Newly Elected Judges—Not Ex­
pected to Accept Decision.
Fargo, N. D., Dec. 11.—That the
three justices-elect may refuse to rec­
ognize the decision of the provisional
court and will stay at Bismarck ready
to hear cases that may come up was
indicated this afternoon by William
Lemke, attorney for the justices-elect.
They have refused to recognize the
provisional court and, therefore, prob­
ably will not accept the decision, said
Mr. Lemke. Undoubtedly any proceed­
ings before the retiring justices will
be subject to review by the new court
when they finally are given formal
possession of their places on the
bench.
"As for salary payments," he said,
"we believe the state officials who han­
dle the pay envelope will exercise their
own discretion in that matter, and will
accept the contentions of the justices
elect that they in fact constitute the
supreme court of North Dakota, rath­
er than the outgoing justices and also
provisional court was without juris­
diction.
Biscarck, N. D., Dec. 11.—Three re­
tiring justices of the supreme court
of North Dakota will not be replaced
by their successors, chosen in the re­
cent election, until the first Monday
in January, under a decision handed
down today, by the provisional su­
preme court, composed of district
judges.
The justices-elect, J. E. Robinson,
Luther E. Birdzell and R. M. Grace
contended the state constitution fixed
the first Monday in December as the
time for the new justices to take their
seats, and had declared that they had
formally qualified last Monday.
The retiring justices, Charles J.
Fisk, E. T. Burke and E. G. Goss, held
that an amendment to the constitution
had eliminated the "first Monday in
December" provision, thereby making
the time for justices' qualification and
assumption of office the same as for
:?. -w -:y\
other state officers, which, is the first
Monday in January.
The decision also set aside the plea
of the justices-elect that the provis­
ional court, made up of four district
court judges, was without authority to
act.
The supreme court tangle has devel­
oped many remarkable features, the
most spectacular of which was staged
at the hearing last Thursday, when
Justice-elect Robinson openly charged
that the provisional court had been
picked to decide against the justices
elect. The provisional court was made
up of District Judges Charles Pollock
of Cass county, C. M. Cooley of Grand
Forks, W. L. Nuessle of Burleigh, W.
C. Crawford of Dickinson, and K. E.
Leighton of Minot.
The justices-elect were chosen by
decisive pluralities in the November
7 election. They were endorsed by the
North Dakota Nonpartisan league.
The court held that the reference in
section ninety-two of the constitution
to the tenure of office of judges of the
supreme court dating from the first
Monday in December, 1889, had ref­
erence wholly to the three judges first
elected, that judges of the supreme
court are state officers and all mem­
bers thereof, save the first three, be­
gin their terms of office on the first
Monday in January. The provision of
the court defends its own constitution­
ality by upholding the right of su­
preme court judges when disqualified
to sit to call in district judges.
Saskatchewan Goes Dry as a Desert.
Gilbert J. Underdahl returned Wed­
nesday from Limerick, Sask., where
he farmed for several years. He has
disposed of his farm, consisting of
three quarter sections of land near
Limerick and next season will again
occupy his farm near Drady. Mr. Un­
derdahl did well in Canada but is glad
tc get back to the states. He says that
at Monday's election, the government
dispensaries that replaced the saloon
in Sasatchewan, were voted out ten to
one and Saskatchewan will be dry
after Dec. 30. Mr. Underdahl believes
that the time is not far distant when
all distilleries in Canada will be shut
down entirely and then the people will
have to get along without intoxicating
liquor of all kinds, as none can be
shipped in. He says that so many of
the men are at war that those who
favored the dispensaries had no show
as the women were all allowed to vote.
Won Bride By Correspondence Wo­
man Was a Negress.
A Ward county bachelor farmer, af­
ter coresponding for two geaga with
Miss Edith Glover of Florence. Kan­
sas, with whom he became acquainted
thru a matriornonial agency, sent the
young woman ?300 at odd times and
again forwarded her 878 for a rail­
road ticket to Minot, intending to mar­
ry her. The young man met the wo­
man at the G. N. station in this city
Saturday evening and as she lifted
her veil, he was horrifigd to learn
that she was a negress/ Of course
he would have nothing to do with her.
The woman grew indifrri'ant and noti­
fied the police, showing them a nicturo
of the young man and letters she had
received from him. He admitted that
he had sent for her but disclaimed
any knowledge as to her being a dusky
damsel. The matter was fixed up
when the bachelor agreed to nay the
young woman's way back to the land
of the sunny south.
Wm. Ehr Buys High Class Porkers.
While at the live stock show at Chi­
cago last week, Wm. Ehr invested in
two thorobred Chester White sows
which had been placed on exhibition
by Harry T. Crandall of Cass City,
Mich. Mr. Ehr paid in the neighbor­
hood of the $300 for the two animals
.but feels that he got his money's
worth as they are bred to School­
master 24,325, the $800 chamnion
boar shown at the show. Mr. Ehr's
purchases include Cass City Belle, 74,
656, and Hattie H. T. 73,108. the lat­
ter a chamnion two-year-old of her
class. Mr. Ehr has a nice lot of Ches­
ter Whites at his farm.

Considerable interest is being taken
by those who are contemplating op­
erating farm tractors the coming year
in the new model four-cylinder tractor

STATE LOANS POPULAR
Grand Forks County Produces High­
est Average Loan per Acre
of Land.
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 12.—State
loans have shown a remarkable gain
in popularity since the reduction of
the rate from six to five per cent, two
years ago. The state land office rec­
ords show that of the $3,766,160 which
was outstanding in first mortgage
farm loans, $1,431,350 had been loaned
during the past two years, while the
remainder of the period the depart­
ment has been in operation, the loans
have aggregated only $2,334,810.
At the close of the fiscal year the
state land commission had 2,251 bor­
rowers, and the loans outstanding cov­
ered 495,600 acres of land. The aver­
age loan per acre was $7.34 the aver­
age amount loaned per section, $1,174,
and the average amount per borrower,
$1,615.
Grand Forks county procured the
highest average loan per acre—-$14.06
county also has the highest individual
—while the lowest was reported as
$4.53 in .Mountrail county. Grand
Forks county also had the highest in­
dividual loan, $3,420, while the lowest
average loan—$780—was found in Mc
Kenzie county.
Cavalier county is the best patron
of the land department, so far as the
number of borrowers is concerned,
having 146. Barnes leads all other
counties in the amount outstanding in
state farm loans, having $257,450. In
Cavalier county the state has loaned
$225,000 in Burleigh, $187,000 in
Bottineau, $155,560.
Major Person and Colonel Hecht at­
tended the live stock show in Chicago
last week, intending to invest in some
pedigreed horses. Not finding what
they wanted at the show, considering
the prices asked, they proceeded to.
Des Moines, la., where they are spnd

bring back some fine animals.
Jacobson Buys Two Hereford Bulls.
Martin Jacobson bought two pure

Bringing Men to Bay at Portal
Took $600 Worth of Hides.
Joe Podusky, who was employed by
the Northwestern Hide & Fur Co.,
since its organization, and Jacob Hel­
met, a German, were arrested at Por­
tal Sunday and returned to this city,
charged with stealing $600 worth of
hides from the concern for which Pod­
usky worked. The hides were recover­
ed and the men were safe behind the
bars of the Ward county jail within
24 hours of the time the theft was
made.
Podusky slept at the hide house on
North Main street and planned with
Helmet to steal the hides. The men
bundled up the valuable hides and
shipped them north over the Soo, leav­
ing for Portal on a later train. The
hides were missed about ten o'clock
Sunday morning. Chief of Police
Dougherty was notified and so effect­
ively did he work that within 2 1-2
hours he had paused the arrest of the
two men. That afternoon, accompan
ing by Officer Bakeman, he went to
Portal. The men had gone across to
the Canadian side but the Canadian
police shoved them across the line into
the United States, where they were
arrested.
They were given a preliminary
hearing before Justice Willis Monday,
who bound them over to the district
court. They appeared before Judge
Leighton Tuesday morning. Podusky
claimed that he was innocent that
Helmet threatened to kill him if he
did not assist in the theft and that he
was to get $25 for his services. He
entered a plea of not guilty.
When Helmet appeared before the
Judge he inquired, "How could I be
guilty if Podusky is not guilty? He
was the head man in stealing the
hides." Both men have virtually
pleaded guilty as neither denies his
participation in the theft.
