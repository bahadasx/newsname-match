j Entente Wi Call For Statement of Terms So They

l i
;! Washington, Dec. 14. The embassies of the entente
j allies here today reflected the view that Germany's peace pro-
! posals will not be rejected without consideration, but that the
j allies in reply probably will call for a statement of proposed
1 terms, so they may not be placed in position of unqualifiedly J
rejecting peace. i
Washington, Dec. 14. The note con
veying the proposal for peace by the
Central Powers -which the United
! States is to transmit to the entente
belligerents, arrived during the night
and was being prepared for President
Wilson early today.
The document was said to be sub
stantially the same as published In the
, unofficial despatches from Berlin in
i the report of the Overseas News
Agency. Accompanying this was a
i confidential report from American
Charge Grew, understood to be an
outline of affairs which gives events
up to the German chancellor's speech
in the reichstag and sending of peace
- proposals. As son as President Wil
son has seen the note, it will be for-
, warded to Minister Whitlock in Bel
glum. Ambassadors Sharp, Page,
Guthrie and Francis, in France, Eng-
1 land, Japan and Russia, and to fho le
gations at the Serbian and Rumanian
. governments.
Peace Proffer Important Question.
The actual transmittal of the peace
i proffer now brings up tho important
question of whether President Wilson
will decide to act merely as an Inter
mediary, or whether he will accom
pany the transmittal with some ex
pression" of hope, in some form, that
the proposals for consideration of
peace shall not be rejected without
examination and reflection. There
Is a prevailing opinion here that the
president was to do something of the
4sort and is looking forward to some
movement of a lineup of nations to
f. preserve peace as one of the elements
(; of the settlement of the war.
i It is possible that some means may
be taken to establish a little more
definitely the temper of the entente
allies toward peace proposals before
the president acts, but it Is understood
there will be no delay in forwarding
the German note to tho foreign bel
ligerent capitals.
f No Change In Meaning.
After reading the German note care,
fully, Secretary Lansing said that
while there were some differences in
translation when compared with the
unofficial copy, and while the order
of arrangement of some of the para
graphs was a little different, there
was absolutely no change in meaning.
Mr. Lansing said the note should go
' tforward to the belligerents presuma
bly today and that no decision had
been reached as to whether the United
States would accompany it with any
expression.
The German note was the only one
to arrive. Nothing has been heard of
the communications from Austria, Bul
garia or Turkey, but it was said they
would be forwarded in the same man
ner without delay.
European Neutrals Send Message.
At least one of the European neu
trals here already has sent a des
patch to his home government ask
I ing to Be authorized to assure Presl
A dent Wilson of the support of his gov
V eminent in sending some expression
. to tho entente allies designed to in
g. fluence them to give consideration to
I the offer to discuss peace. There are
indications that somo of the other
neutrals may follow suit.
German Proposal.
Tokio, Dec. 13. News despatches
: 1 from New York were the first infor-
mation reaching here of Germany's
- peace proposal. The news was a sur
prise and caused a panic on the stock
exchange. Shipping stocks tumbled
and were followed by other securit
ies until the governors ordered the
exchange closed untllTDecmber 16.
The foreign offlce, the" Bank of Jap
an and other influential circles have
received no advices, but gave out in
terviews expressing a firm belief that
the allies would not consider any prop
osition which would leave (Germany
I I in her anti-war position, or anything;
'approximately thereto.
MU3t Fight to End.
Tokio. Dec. 14. Officials of the
Japanese foreign office said today that
they do not take the German peace
Proposals seriously. They expressed
belief that tho entente allies would
have to fight to the end,
Japan, it was stated, has not yet
f! ', been officially notified of the pro
Posals.
? , American Reports Untrue.
t Chrlatlania, Norway, Dec. 14. Via
London, 2:46 p. m. Dr. G. Micha
pelles, German minister to Norway,
is quoted today in the Morgenbladet
as branding as untrue reports cabled
from Washington as to the German
peace terms, saying:
"No program or conditions of peace
will be issued before the entente al
lies have shown willingness to begin
negotiations."
Canada's Peace Attitude.
Ottowa, Ont., Dec. 14. Canada's at.
titude toward the German peace pro
posal is Indicated in a mesage sent
by Sir George Foster, acting premier
of the dominion, to Premier Lloyd
George, as follows:
"Canada stands with you and the
empire for vigorous prosecution of the
war until complete victory', is at
tained." Copenhagen Watching Replies.
Copenhagen. Dec. 14. Via London,
6 p. m. A dispatch to the Polltlken
from Berlin says:
"What the entiro .city and the coun
try are discussing now is not the
proclamation by the emperor or the
speech of Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg, but the nature of the reply
from abroad. The anxiety before the
delivery of the chancellor's speech
was great, but now it is many times
greater.
"Despite the press opinions from
enemy countries of a discouraging na
ture, telegraphed to Germany, it is
hoped they do not express the opin
ions of their respective governments."

PROHIBITION IN

AH Alcoholic Beverages
Barred by Government
Throughout Entire
Country.
Paris, Dec. 14, 10:40 a. in. Total
prohibition throughout France of the
consumption of such alcoholic bever
ages as whiskey, brandies and liquors
has been decided on by the govern
ment. This is shown by the text in
the Journal Officiel today of Premier
Brland's declaration yesterday before
the chamber of deputies on the sub
ject. The premier said:
"The government will ask you to
give it the faculty of solving by de
crees all questions of interest in re
gard to temperance which the laws
are too slow to regulate. A particular
ly grave question, which can bo regu
lated only in war time, the solution
of which involves the life of the coun
try and its salvation, is tho total sup
pression of the consumption of alco
hol." '
The premier's remarks were greet
ed with loud applause 'from many of
the benches. "
Deputy Mayeraus interjected:
"In the army also?"
"Yes, in the entire country," said
the premier.
The use of the term alcohol in this
connection is understood in France to
include such .beverages as absynthe,
whose sale already has been suppress
ed; whiskies, brandies and liquors,
but not wines or beers.

El Paso, Texas, Dec. 14. The poor
of Guanajuato, one of the large mln
ing cities of Central Mexico are dying
at the rate of about seventy persons
a day, according to an affidavit sworn
to by an American mining man just
out of there. The affidavit, which has
been forwarded by government offi
cials to Washington, affirms also that
the women teachers in the parochial
schools had been seized by Carranza
soldiers and tnken to their camps,
while church properties were turned
into bull rings and barracks.
The document goes on to say that
tho poor were wearing native grasses
for clothing and eating roots and
twigs of trees, and corn sent by the
American Red Cross to relieve this
suffering was seized by officials and
sold at $5.50 gold a bushel.
Many Executed for Stealing.
Mexican laborers carrying the dead
from the housbs were a frequent
sight, the affidavit continued, and
many persons were executed in Guan
ajuato and other towns of central
Mexico for stealing food and clothing.
One church in Guanajuato, accord
ing to this same source, was looted
and a bull fight held In it and It
was then used as a barrack for sol
diers of the Carranza garrison. The
women teachers were forced to en
dure tortures worse than death, the
affidavit stated, that were then appor
tioned among- the soldiers.

PREMIER BRIAND
OPPOSES PEACE
r
Denounces German Offer as
Trap for Entente Will Ask
for Greater Army. ,
WARNING TO FRANCE
Enemy Still Making Old Cry,
"It Is Not We Who De
sired This War."
Paris, Dec. 13, 7:55 p. m. Premier
Briand accompanied bis denunciation
of the German peace offer as a trap
with an announcement that he would
ask for the increased power with
which to carry on the war, according
to full reports of his speech before
the chamber of deputies today. At the
same time the premier promised that
the government would not undertake
any scheme of national mobilization
such as that involved in the German
army plan.
"Evidently," said the premier, "re
cent developments are serious but it
is necessary to recall what happened
in 1916. After eight months it is not
a German, but a French victory which
in truth has been Inscribed on French
flags."
French Success at Verdun.
The premier referred to the French
success at Verdun and the gains made
on the Somme and derided Germany'
for Its claim of victory while it- was i
taking such measures as he termed
the militarizing of the entire popula
tion. Tho chamber applauded unani
mously when he affirmed the war gov
ernment of Franco would not follow
the policy of Germany. He -asked,
however, for power to regulate all
questions concerning tho national de.
fense including tho possibility of re
suscitation, but said, if the latter stop
was considered necessary, it would
not be carried out inconsiderately. The
chamber again applauded when lie
asked again for tho suppression of tho
liquor traffic throughout France.
Warns People of France.
Premier Briand expressed the opin
ion that some of the measures taken
by Germany have behind them the ob
ject of intensifying the war next
spring when, he said, she will have
stronger armies to face. He warned
France to be prepared for these ef
forts and to have confidence in the
final outcome. Then he turned to a
discussion of the German peace pro
posal. "It is after having proclaimed its
victory," he said, "while at Iho same
time making new efforts to gain It,
that Germany is sending us certain
words which I am not able to explain.
You have read the address delivered
by Von Bethmann-Holweg, the chan
cellor of the German empire. I have
not the text and therefore I cannot
give an official opinion, but it is an
improbable circumstance that they
who are asked to intervene will ac
cept a task which might well disturb
confidence here. I will make known
officially the precise concerted opin
ion of the allies, but I must now warn
my country against a possible poison
ing of opinion. When a country, arm
ed to the teeth, mobilizes its entire
civilian population at the risk of ruin
ing its commerce and disorganizing
tho homes of which It is so proud,
when Its factories are working overt
timo to Increase its war materials and
when it takes, in disregard of the law
of nations, the people of an invaded
country and obliges them to work for
it, If at that moment I do not cry out
to my country: 'Look out, take care,'
I would be entirely culpable.--What
comes from yonder as a proposition to
negotiate peace is made at a time
when Belgium is invaded, Serbia is in
vaded, ten departments of France are
invaded."
Crlr..es Are Unpunished.
Deputy Andre Lofevrc here inter
rupted saying: "And crimes unpun
ished." Premier Briand resumed:
"It is a redoubtable moment and I
cannot call your attention too much
to the facts. What do we see in this
address? It is tho same cry to de-.
ceive neutrals, or the clairvoj'ance of
the German people 'It was not we
who desired this horrible war. It was
imposod on us.' I want to answer
for the hundredth time, 'No, you were
the aggressors and whatever you say
the facts are there to prove it. Tho
blood is on your heads and not ours.'
Denounces German Maneuver.
"Now, cominsr to the bottom of
things, I havo the right to denounce
ihis maneuver, this gross trap. We
want, it is said by our enemies, to
give our people all the means to pros
per that they can desire. Otbors are
offered, as alms, a cqnsent not to an
nihilate them. After the Marne, after
Verdun, Franco resisting firmly, is of
fered this. Such a document must
be thoroughly mediated upon to see
toward what objects It tends."
There was loud applause at those
words and Deputy Thierry Cazes
shouted: "The country thinks as you
do." '
Premier Briand then concluded:
"From this rostrum I must say that
there is a maneuver to separate the
allies, disturb the conscience and de
moralize the people of the French re
public. In circumstances such as this
one will not do less than the convention.

NEW CABINET
DISAPPOINTING
!
i French Press Lukewarm in Its
I Reception Premier Must
Act Promptly.
TASK IS ENORMOUS
New Government Trying to
Mend Broken Down Engine
by Putting on New Tires.
Paris, Dec. 14, 5 a. m. The disap
pointment shown by the press over
the now administration is emphasized
on yosterday's sitting of the chamber
of deputies. Even Premier Briand's
sensational announcement of his in
tention to prohibit by decree the sale
of spirituous liquor passes almost un
noticed. The steady supporters of tho pre
mier such as tho Figaro, are but luke
warm In their appreciation. Alfred
Capus, editor of the Figaro, writes:
"Premier Briand faced his adversa
ries with rare authority on tho ques
tion of the German peace proposal,
which dominates the hour, his sincer
ity and eloquence wero unchanged
I from the assembly until unanimous
applause. Neither is it possible to
contest the value of the proposed re
forms especially that concerning al
cohol which the government has en
gaged to carry out in the shortest
possible time. 'Wo do not believe in
his will and energy,' say tho oppo
nents of Briand. It is for him to an
swer them tomorrow by acts of de
cision and prompt, irrestible vigor to
show that he is truly master of the
situation. With a large minority, par
liamentary exlstenco is certainly dif
ficult, but nothing Is easy nowadays.
The task of governing In this tempest
and amid these obstacles is worthy
of the premier. 'Make of an obstacle
a medium, even of thy action,' pro
claimed the wisdom of the ancients.
They should be the device of every
Frenchman today, particularly those
who lead in the nation's council."
In the senate today the now minis
try will have to havo another on
slaught This time Georges Clemen
ceau, who characterizes the new gov
ernment as an attempt to mend a
broken down engine by putting on a
new pair of tires; Henri Berenger and
Adrien Gaudin do Vlllaino and others
intend to interpellate the government
on the general situation. If Premier
Briand accepts tho debate the senate
will go into secret sitting for which
all preparations havo been made. It
will not, however, be as long a one
as the chamber held, as the senate is
unanimously of the opinion that tho
sitting should notflast more than three
or four hours.

VON MACKENSEN ARMIES I
, FIGHTING THEIR WAV : I
FORWARD IN RUMANIA I
All of Great Wallachia South of Railroad, Between i I
Bucharest and Tchernavoda, Now in ! I
Hands of Teutonic Forces. ! I
While the warring nations are await
ing definite developments from the
presentation of peace proposals by
Germany and her allies, the opera
tions on the various fighting fronts
are proceeding as usual.
The immediate future, so far as the
peace proffers ar" concerned, is in
dicated as likely to be taken up by
consultations among the entente pow
ers preliminary to the sending of a
Joint reply.
Interest in military developments
still centers uppn Rumania where the
armies of Field Marshal von Mack
ensen are fighting their way forward,
despite the -difficulties of transport
caused by the bad condition of the
roads in a Rumanian winter,
j Whether the Rumanians have suc
I ceeded in establishing themselves
along the line of the Buzeu, near the
southern Moldavian border, is not yet
apparent. Berlin's last specific men
tion in this connection was made in
last night's communication in which
the Teutonic forces were reported to
be nearing the Buzeu. In any event,
it appears that tho Rumania evacua
tion of southern Wallachia is virtually
complete, as tho German war office
announces that Great Wallachia, south
of the Bucharest Tchernavoda rail
way, has been cleared of hostile forces.
Beyond the Gorman report of the re
pulse of a French attack in the Ar
gonne on the western front and of
Serbian assaults on Bulgarian posi
tions in Macedonia, the war news pre
sents little else of interest
Submarines Sink Coal Ships.

NATIONWIDE
PROHIBITION
Proposed National Amend
ment Favorably Reported to
House by Vote 12 to 7.
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
Long Sought Amendment to
U. S. Constitution Is
Submitted.
Washington, Dec. 14. Tho proposed
national prohibition amendment was
today ordered favorably reported to
the house by the judiciary committee
by a vote of 12 to 7.
The proposed universal suffrage
J i J ,1 . trl
without recommendation.
Vote on Suffrage 7 to 8.
Tho vote on the suffrage proposal
was 11 to 8. The resolution by Rep
resentative Raker would submit the
several Susan B. Anthony amend
ments to tho states.
Chairman Webb of tho committee
said ho would not ask for a rule on
the prohibition resolution until after
the Christmas recess. He will not ask
for any action on tho suffrage pro
posal. Representative Gard of Ohio,
who has been opposed to suffrage, was
chosen to report it
Representative Carlin of Virginia
will report the prohibition proposal.
Can Beat Suffrage.
The reporting of the suffrage pro
posal was due to tho belief of some
of its opponents that it can be beaten
on tho floor and they thought it best ;
to setle the issue by bringing it tb a .
direct vote in the house. i
An effort was made to couplo it in
the voting as was done at the last
session of congress and which resulted '
in both proposals being kept in tho '.
committee and consideration of them '
postponed indefinitely. The commit- J
tee by a large majority, however, '
voted not to do so.
Move a Surprise.
The reporting of the suffrage amend
ment was a -surprise to its supporters.
The designation of Representative
Walsh, of Massachusetts, an anti-suffragist,
to succeed Representative .
Moss of West Virginia as a member
of tho committee, a few days ago, was '
generally believed by many suffrago t
leaders to haVe dealt a death blow to
their chances of having any sort of
a suffrage resolution reported this
year.
Webb Prohibition Amendment.
Tho proposed prohibition amend
ment drawn by Chairman Webb fol
lows: Section one That the sale, manu
facture for sale, transportation for
sale and importation for sale of intox- :
icating liquors for beverage purposes
in tho "United States and all territor- '
ies subject to the jurisdiction thereof ''
and exportation thereof, are forever
prohibited. ';'
Section two. That the congress and !
the states shall have power inde
pendently, or concurrently, to enforce
this article by all needful legislation.
The suffrage resolution follows: ,
Section one. The right of citizens
of the United States to vote shall not ;
be denied or abridged by the United 1
States or by any state on account of
sex.
Section two. -Congress shall have
power, by appropriate legislation, to
enforce the provisions of this article. j

Paris, Dec. 13. The conquest of
Rumania by the Teutonic allies con
tinues. All along the front the Ru

ward, and the Ninth German army is
nearing the important railroad junc
tion town of Buzeu.
In tho Carpathians and along the

Germans are still at grips, with the
Russians aggressors at most points.
There Is little, If any change in the
situation in these regions, however.
Heavy artillery fighting is In prog

wise calm prevails. A new feature of
the Balkan situation is a. report from
Sofia that 6,000 Albanians havo defeat
ed a force of Italians near Pasncslna,

On tho front in France and Belgium
