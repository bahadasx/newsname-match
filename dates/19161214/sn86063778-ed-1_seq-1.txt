CONGRESS TAKES UP
DEFENSE MEASURES
*. ? :;
AGITATION FOR DRASTIC MEASURES
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE
IS DEVELOPING.
DANIELS BEFORE COMMITTEE
Secretary Will Ask for Appropriation |
to Hasten Battleship Construction. I
Would Compel Steel Companies to j
Give Government Preference.
I
Wshington.?The attention of Con- i
gre^s was dirocted sharply to mat- j
ter.s relating to both tho army and !
navy which are expected to be produc- .
tive of agitation for even more drastic
measures of national defense than
have yet been seriously considered.
Secretary Daniels, before the House
naval committee advocated legislation
which Would compel steel companies
and other nrivate concerns to civo
preference to government orders for |
military supplies. He will submit n
new section for the pending nnval appropriation
bill for this purpose in
order to hasten battleship construction,
which he declared was being delayed
by commercial work in the yards
of private builders and in the steel
plants .
Secretary Baker wrote Speaker
Clark In response to a House resolution.
that 71.834 out of the grand total
of 163.800 national guardsmen taken
Into the Federal service up to August
31 ware without previous military
training. Rejections of enrolled
Kuardsmen for-various causes operated
later to Increase the number of
raw recruits to approximately 60 per
cent of the force.
In this connection also, army officers
charged with the duty of studying
events of the European war. both politic^
and military, made preparations
to contend before the congressional
military committee that the fundamental
reason for the cabinet crisis in
England was the volunteer military
policy there prior to the passage of
the conscription act. The experience
oi ureal uruain is viewed by these of- i
fleers as the strongest of arguments j
for the establishment of universal
training in the United States, as urged
in the report of Major General
M Scott, chief of staff, and to which the
entire American staff is committed.
Another aspect of the National
Guard situation came from Quartermaster
General Sharpe who told of a
$25,000,000 deficiency incurred by the
war department to equip and pay state
troops now in the Federal service. If
an average of 75.000 men are retained
on the border until June 20. he said,
the deficiency will be $50,000,000. The
universal training advocates are expected
to use these figures in contending
that prohibitive cost would he the
result of the present system if the
nation needed a great army.

IN ARABIA CASE
ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR
SINKING BRITISH LINER
WITHOUT WARNING.
GERMANYSENDS NOTE TOU.S
Note Over Incident Received by U. S.
Officials Places Submarine Warfare
issue on a Clear-Cut Serious Basis.
?No Quick Action.
Washington.?Germany's acceptance
of responsibility for the sinking without
warning of the British liner Arabia,
with the explanation that her subma
rine i-uuiiiittiiuwr iouk iii? vuwhui lur
an auxiliary warship, has brought the
issue over submarine warfare to a
more serious and clear-cut basis than
anything that has happened since the
threat of the United States to break
diplomatic relations after the torpedoing
of the channel liner near Sussex
last April.
The German note, which was made
public by the state department, says
if official data is furnished showing
that the vessel was an ordinary passenger
steamer, "this then would be a
case of regrettable mistake from which
the German government would promptly
draw the appropriate consequences."
It is assumed here that the consequences
would be an expression of regret
and offer of reparation for any injury
or danger suffered by the Americans
on board.
The note has been referred to
President Wilson, who is considering
personally a review of recent German
submarine activities to which the
Arabia case comes as a climax. There
probably will be no immediate action,
as the state department first must
clear up beyond question the exact
status of the liner at the time of the
attack. Then it will be for the president
to decide the course to be followed.
In official quarters the German explanation
is regarded as weak and
unsatisfactory, no weight being attached
to the statements that the
Arabia was painted like a transport
and was following a route usually taken
by transports, and that -the subma
rine commander saw many Chinamen
but no women and children aboard her.
It is realized, however, that if official
data finally establishes the innocent
character of the vessel, in view of the
Sussex case, virtually only one action
remains open to the United States, and
that would not bo taken until every
possible consideration had been given
Germany's position.

fEUTONS TAKE BUCHAREST
rEUTONS CAPTURE CAPITAL OF
RUMANIA AS CLIMAX OF BIG
DRIVE.
End of Conquest Comes Just 100 Days
After Rumania Enters Into European
Conflict.?Important Railway
Junction Also Surrenders.
Bucharest, the Capital of Rumania,
s in the hands of the forces of the
Central Powers.
Exactly 100 days after the declaraion
of war by Rumania against them
inds the Teutonic Allies in control of
ibout 50,000 square miles of Rumanan
territory?virtually one-half of the
Kingdom?running from the Transylranian
Alps northwest of the Capital
:o the Danube south of it, and a large
?art of Dobrudja, and probably still
jn the heels of the retreating Russian
tnd Rumanian armies which have
jeen endeavoring to hold them back.
Simultaneously with the announcement
of the fall of Bucharest came
:he news of the capture of the important
railroad iunction of Ploerhtl
lorth of the Capital, the conquest of
which places in the hands of the invaders
the last railroad in the west
ind gives to them the head of the
ine running northward to Jassy,
where the Capital of Rumania is now
dtuated.
No details have as yet come
through concerning the climax to the
;reat drive of the armies of General
von Falkenhayn and Field Marshal
von Mackensen, or whether the Rumanians
or Russians succeeded enirely
in making their escape behind
he Bucharest line. Previous to the
mnouncement of the capture of
Bucharest and of Ploechtl unofficial
advices had indicated that four divisons
of the defenders were in a hazirdous
position in tha region due
west of Bucharest and in danger of
being enveloped.
The taking of Bucharest virtually
completes the conquest by the Teutonic
forces of the southern section of
the Rumanian kingdom, embracing
territory of more than 50.000 square
miles and marks the culmination of
in operation accounted by military
commentators one of the most soundly
conceived and brilliantly executed
feats of the great war.
From the hour when Field Marshal
von Mackensen forced a crossing of
he Danube and on November 24 set
foot on Rumanian Roil nfTontlne a
junction shortly afterward with General
von Falkenhaven's armies, drlvinfc
through Wallacbia from the west,
there seemed little doubt of the ultimate
fate of the Rumanian Capital.
The relentless pressure of the Teutonic
invading armies, with their prexmderance
of heavy artillery proved
too much for King Ferdinand's forces
nice the Rumanian front was broken.

! HALT LABOR VOTE
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION WILL
AWAIT RESULT OF LEADER'S
EFFORTS.
ALLIANCE IS BEARING FRUIT
Effort Being Made to Draft Substitute
For All Forms of Compulsory Arbitration
Which Will Be Agreeable to
All.
Washington.?Congressional action
cn President Wilson's railway legislation
program probably will await the
result of determined efforts of labor
leaders to draft a substitute for all
forms of compulsory arbitration which
will be agreeable to their followers,
employers and the administration.
The determination of the president
to undertake making impossible by
such law a situation as he faced last
September in the railroad dispute hast
> aroused labor to the greatest activity.
, The unofficial alliance between tlio
' American Federation of Labor and the
four railway brotherhoods arranged
recently at Baltimore is bearing its
first fruit in conference between representatives
of both organizations to
draft a plan that will shelve all compulsory
arbitration bills. Congressional
leaders are inclined to go slowly on
the president's program pending announcement
of labor's proposals, provided
they are revealed during the
present session of Congress.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, said
that conferences already have taken
place between brotherhood and Federation
leaders, but that no concrete
plan had been worked out. Hope exists,
,he said, that some plan can be drawn
that will make congressional action
unnecessary.
"Organized labor," he said, "always
will oppose any form of compulsory
arbitration."
If a scheme satisfactory to the
workers is drafted. It is understood,
it will be submitted to representatives
of the railroads and other employers
and to the president. Approval of it
probably would mean that Congress
would eliminate the compulsory arbitration
feature from any legislation
enacted.
DEPORTATION OF BELGIANS

Washington.?Tho American Government's
formal protest to Germany
against the depotation of Belgians
for forced labor, as a violation of tho
principles of humanity, was made public
by the State Department. It was
in the form of a note, cabled to
Charge Grew at Berlin with instructions
that he seek an interview with
the German Chancellor and read it
to him and was given out by the Department
with the terse comment:
"The interview has taken place."
Officials refused to add to this
statement, and so far as could be
learned there has been no reply from
Germany. All information available,
however, indicates that the deportations
are continuing, and it is known
that through earlior informal representations
Charge Grew learned that
the German position was that the
policy was a military necessity and
not in violation of international law.

LETTER FROM STATF FYPFRT
State Entomologist Worsham Saya
Cotton Pest is Threatening Sea
Island Industry.
Columbia -The Mexican cotton boll
weevil has infested three Georgia
counties, bordering on South Carolina,
namely Burke, KfTingham and Chatham.
according to a letter received by
K. J. Watson, cotnissloner of agriculture.
from 10. Lee Worsham. stato entomologist
of Georgia.
"In Chatham county," says Mr.
Worsham, "it appears to be only 15
miles from the Savannah river. The
advance eastward this year has been
about 150 miles and with a favorable
seson next year the southern and western
parts of your state will become infested
by the weevil.
"We are arranging to call a convention
of the sea island growers of this
state some time in January, for the
purpose of having a heart to heart talk
with them on sea island cotton and the
boll weevil and we will be very glad
indeed for the sea island growers of
your state jttul Florida to meet with
us. The experiments which we have
conducted for a period of years on
early fruiting varieties of sea island
cottno are the only experiments that
have l>oen conducted. Our results are
very promising indeed and we are of
the opinion that if the sea island grow
< m ?4ii |iui?ui' nits proper course, tney
run continue to grow some cotton, but
there is a great danger of their becoming
stampeded and trying to grow
short cotton instead. This, as you
knvw, will be very disastrous to the
sea island industry. In view of the
fact that Georgia. South Carolina and
Florida raise all the hcr island cotton
grown in this country, 1 feel that
we ought to pull together and do everything
in our power to save this industry.
Will you be willing to cooperate
with us and urge your sea island
men to attend the convention at
some central point some time in January?
"You are going to find in your work
in South Carolina that you are going
to need all the help that you can possibly
get from every conceivable
source In convincing the farmers and
business men that the boll weevil is a
permanent and serious factor in cotton
production. Your problem in
South Carolina is identical with that
of Georgia, and I hoj>e that whenever
this department can be of service to
your Rood people you will not hesitate
to call on us."
