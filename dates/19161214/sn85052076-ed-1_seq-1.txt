Madison County's Victory
The voting for the $ 35.000 Bridge Bonds, on last
Thursday, as given on another page ol this issue, is cer
tainly a victory (or Madison County.
We say "Victory" for the county because one more
impediment is removed in order that our county may
prosper and grow more unselfish.
, It is difficult to understand why citizens of a county
should oppose anything that is for the common good.
Let us study our needs and those of others, when like
issues come before us, and we will guarantee prosperity
and happiness.
Germany and the Belgians
The expatriation of the Belgians comes as a new
oppression of a people that has suffered much since the
war begun.
Those who wish welt to the Germans feel sorry that
their leaders should add another count to the indictment
that already is against them in respect to Belgium. Our
own government warned them against "producing an
unfavorable effect on neutral opinion."
The entire scheme of imposing deportation upon the
Belgians or' any other nation is repellent to the modern
man's sense of justice and decency. It is too strong a
reminder of the days when the vanquished became the
lave of the victor.
Let us hope, that since neutral opinion is not a neg
ligible thing, that this atrocious practice may have much
to do with ending the war.
TBI PRACTICAL FARMERS' EDUC
ATIONAL PROBLEM BOLTED
Secretary Marshall E. Vaughn
This Is the greatest year in the
history of our nation for country
boys and girls to go to school. The
European nations (hat are in the
midst of a great world war are us
ing practically all the farm products
that are usually imported into the
United Plates; and the great demand
for food supplies raised in this
country to be shipped abroad is
making everything grown on the
farm very high.
The operation of great munition
factories has brought about increas
ed wagea for the man who works
for hia dally bread, but the prices
he pays the farmer for the food he
eats are so hHfli that his condition
is nut materially rhung'-d. Hut the
farmer who owns his farm, or rents
one, does hia own work, sells his
own products, and uses his money
according to his own sweet will is
the great independent man of this
age.' .
There are two classes of farm

The Cabinet crisis in England has
ended by the appointment of Lloyd-
George as Prime Minister and the
creation of a sub-committee of five
to have charge of the war. The

leader has come from hnmhln hlrlh

than has been entrusted to any one
man in England for many years. !
