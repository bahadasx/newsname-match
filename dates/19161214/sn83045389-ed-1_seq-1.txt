The view e\pressed here is that ?S. r
oian> would have th" most to train fri'ir
an arn .sti- e, owinc t" rei-.-nt losses
on vat'"ii- tlphlinc fronts and inoinic
strintsenrieM within Totiuuii'- territorj
Km that reason the prospect of an
arni'sti"" 's n-'t f cardoil with fnv..r
in l.oiidon. and th" suiiK":ti"ii is :ul
Min.-ed that on.- of th" chief motives
prompt itm tlo proposal w as t.. nain
t ime.
? 'oin-erninc utlofllcial reports that
nil" of the T. titonii- proposals is a re
turn to the status quo Iii fore tip war.
except as to lh< .f.-ation of polish and
l.ithuaniiiii kinptloms. it is said here
that this apparently i- impossihl". from
tlie Uritish viewpoint, as it would not
provide any "ompensat ion to ll'-lu ium.
whosi defense lias always I referred
to as one of the principal motives of
(Sreat ltritain in enterinw the cniiflii't.
In th" same eirdes Russia's refusal
nls.i is e\pect "d of any settlement
which would leave purls of Serbia
within Teutonic authority, owinc to the
hearinK of Hie Serbian mi"st|>n on
Russia's "tit ranee into the war.
Although little confidence is shown
in l.i.ndoti that any result will come
from the peace proposal of the central
powers, and tlie opinion prevails quite
generally Hint the time is not oppor
tune even to discuss terms, there is an
undercurrent of feeling that something
would lie gained by making the world
acquainted definitely with the objects
of (he belligerents.
The attitude of the Urilish govern
ment I own rd the offer will be mad"
known in Hie House of Commons to
morrow. provided sulllciunt time shall J
have elapsed lo permit consultation i
with ilreat Hritain's allies, and this
statement is awaited with the greatest
interest.

If the press which supports the ad
ministration correctly interprets of
ficial opinion, littl" time will b" taken
up by consideration of the move of t5"r
niany and her allies, although the mod
erate ..pinion of the country does not
favor too hasty rejection of the over
lures. It is believed the German peo
ple. once they are acquainted with the
objects of the entente, might be more
inclined toward peace, and that for
thai reason, if for no other, the terms
of the entente allies should be mado
known officially lo th.- central powers.
The possibility that President Wilson
Vill make some suggestions when for
iriling the offer also is much dis
ussed. 11 is intimated that he might
least express willingness to convey
ic terms of the entente to the central
ovvers.

Times-Dispatch Trucks Will Make
Itounil of Schools, and Each Will
Receive Credit According to Size
of Accumulation.
1 hotis,'i mis of Kichmond boys and
girls received a little lesson in thrift
yesterday wlien the principals of the
forty-four public schools brought to
their attention the movement for the
consorvat ion of ilif paper supply
through putting old nowspiipors and
inacii/inrs to work again. This plan,
which has the approval of l?r. J. A. f\
< "handler. Superintendent of ("ity
Schools, calls for the children to bring
with them to-morrow morning all of
the waste paper they can conveniently
??arr.v. This paper will be collected and
sold in hulk. the proceeds being turned
over to the schools in proportion to the
amount collected from 'each, to he used
for an\ purpose the school desires.
It is expected that thousands of
pounds of old papers and magazines
will he brought to the schools to
morrow. The Times-Dispatch has
made arrangements to collect all of this
paper from the schools, give a receipt
for it. and then sell the entire lot at
wholesale prices. It will then he
shipped to the mills ami remade into
paper that w ill !>?? later used for print
ins or for wrapping up parcels.
Dr. ('handler has given the move
ment hi^ heartiest indorsement, and
yesterday notified each principal that
lie would expect active co-operation
with The Times-Dispatch it) its cam
paign. which has two ends?the con
serving of ihe paper supply and the
good of the schools, which will get a
financial benefit from the energy and
thrift of the children.

A representative from The Times
Dispatch visited many of the schools
for the purpose of explaining the plan,
lie found the school principals alive
to the benefits of the movement, and
t many of them had already made plans
to g..| the children working, as they
hope that the success of the first col
lection to-morrow will result in still
larger collections on the Thursday
following.
Many are the uses to which the
schools are planniuu to put the money.
< Mo is cninc to have a i 'hristmas tree.
Another hopes to be able to provide
better lunches for hundreds of little
colored children. Still another expects
to make enough to take better care of
the teeth of the boys and girls. In
fact, every school has some use for
e\tra money, even tile John Marshall
High School, where the cadets are de
sirous of getting overcoats Whether
the money ?i|| lie used for that pur
pose. lion ever, has not been decided.
The lesson from the saving of waste
paper is a valuable one. as pointed out
to the children. I'a per is the scarcest
industrial commodity in America to
day, and its use is absolutely neces
sary in man* ways, including the pub
lishing of books, maga'/.ities and news
papers. Ail of this is being brought

any exchanges of views that may fol

tho course to bo followed by tho I'nited
States. and probably will not. pending
the a rn va I ot the ollicial cablegram
containing tho communication handed
Charge Crow by tho Gorman govern
' tnont.
As tho cablegram had not boon re
ceived at tho State Department to
iiiuht. otlicials were reticent about dis
; cussing tho situation. It is understood
that tho communication will bo trans
mitted promptly to the entente gov
ernments regardless of what attitude
m#j bo adopted by tho Ihiltod States,
and that the American course probably
must be guided largely by tho recep
tion given the Teutonic offer in tli ?
entente countries. It is rewarded
certain, however. that either informally
or formally, quietly or publicly, Mi"
government hero will find a way of
displaying its interest in the restora
tion ot peace. Most officials think :<
: considerable time will ? lapse after the
communication is delivered before a
formal reply is framed by tho allies,
j and that in 'he meantime a very clear
idea of what that reply is to be and
1 how any attempt at mediation by nou
(trtils would be viewed will be gained
I through diplomatic channels.

The trend of public opinion in Great
Britain. France and Cussia is being
; followed closely, and the American
i ambassadors in those countries have
! been instructed to forward promptly
'any available indication of oflielal
, views.
President Wilson's only one confer
ence on the subject to-day was with
t'olonol fc. M. House. It was suggested
during the day that ihe President
might disenss the situation in general
terms before tho annual conference of
Governors here to-morrow, but ho had
not decided to-night whether he would
accept an invitation lo address the
Governors, and had given no indication
of what might b. hi:, subject if he did
speak.
Much interest is felt here in the
speech to be delivered to-morrow night
.'it St. Louis before the I.ojigno to Kit
force Pence by Senator Stone, chair
man of tho Senate Foreign Relations
committee. The v is no understand
ing. however, thit the Senator, if ho
touches upon the latest development
will do so as a spokesman of the ad
j ministration
I lie 1 'tilted States, by reason of Its
dual responsibility of representing the
interests of most of the central pow
ers and the entente governments in
the capitals of their enemies, would
of course heroine the medium of com
munication through which any replv
of the entente governments to the cen
tral belligerents would bo made.
The German embassy had no further
advices, on the terms of the central
governments, but it was freely admitted
j that terms bad purposely boon omitted
j from tho Chancellor's speech and the.
note, because the sole purpose was to
j propose a conference on terms, and
| carefully avoid advancing any which
might be made the basis of a re
fusal.

The Teutonic diplomats, reflect in;,
tho views of their governments, be
lievo die answer of the entente allies
will be an iii<|iiiry as to the basis on
w ii'eh i formally- proposes peace, ami
with that much as a foundation they
see the wailing nations well on the
way to a conference from which they
aro sanguine peace would result.
The probability of the entente al?
lies themselves making some announce,
ment of the terms on which they would
make peace is tegarded hero as having
tremendous possibilities for effect upon
the German people themselves.
Ihe President cancelled all his out
side . ngagements to-day, including on*
to preside over the annual meeting of
the American Ited i 'ross, and rernalneit
in tiic \\ hile Mouse, whore he con
ferred with Colonel K M. House, hi3
friend and advisor, who made a trip
to F.ui opp to sound out peace senti

House may go again if the President
makes a move to accompany i?cr

It was reiterated that until the offi

transmittal to the entente belligerent.!
no decision could be reached as to
w.hat the I'ntted States won id do, fur*

The l.ondon press comment on th?
