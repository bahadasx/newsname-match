$15,000 Carnegie Library
Carnegie Corporation Offers That Sum for the Erection of
a Building in Malta--County Commissioners Have
Raised Fund for Maintainance of Library
The people of Phillips county
have taken a great interest in the
proposition to erect a Carnegie li
brary in Malta, a subject that was
taken up by the Woman's club of
this city several months ago and has
b~een pushed by that live organiza
tion ever since. The following let
terr front Mrs. J. F. Kilduff will be
read with a great deal of pleasure
by the people of the county.
ldtlitor Enterprise:
The I arnegie Corporation has ini
(licated their willingness to build a
library in Malta to cost $15,000.
This library will be for all the
peopile of Phillips county, each town,
country postollice said school district
can have a branch library and be
supplied with hooks from the Malta
Carnegie library.
Betore' the C:arnegie Corporation
will consider an application for a
~> library, a free site must be offered
thenm. When we made our applica
tion for a libirary, Mr. Trafton gen
erously donated a beautiful site and
this was the qnly site offered us.
'his: site consists of fo ur lots w,,hich
are distant one and one-halt blocks
freol the First State Bank and two
bloelbs from the isostotlice 'l'hese

Maltat would support it.. it was ex
plected that the hiih school would
tako over the management of' tlte
ituite~e and they dltd.
C'onsequently, ~the friends andl
p~atrons ot the school are giveni an
opportunity to vote to favor of the
progressiveness of Itte older boys
and girls, who are yet in school.
Manty have cast their ballots in fa
vor of the lyceum course. More
have not..
[to- the attempt. to present the
course, at a price within the reach
of all, the s~choot runs the usual risk
of having a deficit before them at
the end of the season. This should
not be. Malta is abld to fill the hall
for every one of the remaining num
bers. The new hall will seat '3.50
to 400 people. The management
wishes to see every seat filled on
1)ec. 21, when Granville Jones will
lecture. It is not charity they ask.
It is patronage that they desire.
If you think they do please express
your belief by attending this next
number.
STOLE 1,000 BUSHELS OF
FiLAX NEAR POPULAR
Flax growers around Poplar have
been robbed of nearly 1,000 bushels

Lien, Edward Nygard and Bert
Campinan. Lien is said to have lost
400 bushels of flax taken from his

if Montana was to benefit front'O
dtistributio't of this money it. would
up to the counties ito meet 1hw Fed-j

through its High way Commission
wvould furnish the plants and speci

To secure otto of the projects for
Phillips county it wouild be neces

$20,000 making in all $40,000
which wotultd he spent ini this county
on roads. This accordinig to Mr.

Eua'tern Montana counties are go

If such a law is enacted, repre

the newver counties increased. Lewis

is said, would each lose a represent
