Over 13,500,000 has been rained by

Idea originated.
While lied Cross ncaln really dato

ago In Delaware. Minn Emily P. Din
noil of Wilmington read an article by
Jacob Itlln, dencriblng stamps used for
tuberculosis work in Norway, and she
conceived the Idea of a nlmllar plan
here. 81ngto handed, she launched a
nalo which resulted In 13,000 clear
money. When Mins Ulnnell tried to
convince the American Red Cross that
the Idea should be made national an a
peace activity of that society, she met
with opposition, but finally persuaded
the authorities, with the result that on
Reinvestment of a few hundred dollars
$135,000 worth of seals wan sold In 1908
and (ho great national campaign waa
launched. Slnco then tho sale has
gone forward by IcapH and bounds,

The policy on which the sale is con

because of the various, warring gov-"
ernments must first consider the pro

a deadlock on the terms essential to a

should support them.
"Instead of the peace proposals
deadening the efforts of the American

will only spur our committee on.
"A conference of neutrals should be

are expressed this afternoon following
the running aground of the diver In
the dense fog Just -outside Humboldt

pounded by the angry sea for several
hours.
It Is believed that the superstruc

The submarine tender Cheyenne Is
standing by, helpless. The coast
guard crew in attempting to rescue
the crew shot a line over the vessel,
butt nobody appeared to make it fast.
This causes the belief that the crew is
Injured.
