COSTS OF DELIVERY ONE
CAUSE OF HIGH PRICES
Investigation Shows It to Be About 8
Per Cant, of Retail Cost.
Washington, Dec. 13. Some idea of
the extent to which expenses ftf local
distribution of commodities enter into
the cost of living was given today in
a report on a preliminary survey of
the subject by the " census bureau.
Knowing thethere in Washington the
cost of delivery is about 8 per cent, of
retail price?.
The bureau's investigation covered
four classes of., commodities ice, coal
and wood, milk and department stori I

the commerce tteriartmentrtn 'wllOm the
report was submitted, said he consid

ing some representative city or cities
and detailing experts to make a more
complete study of the subject. Di
rector Rogers, of the bureau, will con-'
fer with the secretary within a few
days to select the place or" places
where such a detailed investigation
can be best made.
Secretary Redfield believes that in
this single phase of cost great econ
omies are possible and that a detailed
survey will focus the attention of
consumers upon the advisability of
eliminating duplication to reduce this
clement of coat of living.
The Investigation here disclosed that
for the four selected classes of mer

nales of about $6,000,000, the cost of
delivery was nearly $500,000.
TALK OF CLEARING
HOUSE FOR NARCOTICS
Suggestion Made to ,New York Legis
lative Committee.
New Tork, Dec. 13. Establishment
of a clearing house for narcotics un
der control of the various health de
partments of the state was suggested
here today to the joint legislative
committRB investi-atJn th rln.n- fivii
: o ' ' I
by Police lieutenant Henry bcherb,
head of the "narcotics squad," as the
surest way to check the illicit traffic
in drugs. He said the clearing house
should be the sole custodian of habit-
forming drugs where physicians, den
tists and veterinarians could apply for
supplies. In this way, he asserted,
check could be kept on persons who
buy drugs and on the quantities sold.
Lieutenant Scherb declared that im
mense profits are made by the sale of
certain drugs to persons addicted to
their use.
"I know there are five men in New
York who finance this trade," he said,
"and who are not amenable to the law
because they never handle it. Ninety -five
per cent, of the narcotics shipped
out of this country go from New York
to Canada, Mexico and Cuba and we
know that a large amount of this is
returned to the United States. It
comes into the states in automobiles
and by train. That is the real men
ace of the drug traffic".

presses the standpoint-adopted by ' the

acted on the dfensfve while Russia
and France followed an aggressive
policy fc.nd Great Britain, In joining
them, strengthened their hope of shat
tering Germany and the dual mon
archy. The premier continued:
"We drew the sword, 'however, with
out any idea of conquest or destruc
tion of cur enemy. We have always
been ready before the war, at the mo
ment of its outbreak and in Its entire
duration to conclude peace. The rea
son we cou'd not previously show our
peaceful desires in such solemn man
ner was that we were confronted by an
enemy who aimed at our destruction,
and to whom, therefore, we could make
an offer of peace only, when no one
could see it in asign of weakness."

Dr." Henry E Jackson of the federal

.S BEING GIVEN CONSIDERATION
,BY PRESIDENT WILSON
WITH ENTENTE POWERS
Cablegram Has Not Been Received at
the State Department American
Course Will be Guided Largely by
Reception of Offer by Entente.
Washington, Dec. 13; Serious con
sideration is being given by President
Wilson to the possibility that any ex
changes of views that may follow the
peace proposals of the central powers
to the entente allies may develop an
opportunity to bring forward the sug
gestion for a league of nations to en
force permanent peace. He has reach
ed no decision, however, as to the
course to be followed by the United
States and probably will not pend.ng
the arrival of the official cablegram
containing the communication handed
Charge Grew by the German govern
ment. .
Cablegram' Not Yet Received.
The cablegram had not been receiv
ed at the state department tonight and
in tha meantime all officials wer
most reticent. It is understood that
the communication will be transmit
ted promptly to the entente govern
ments regardless of what attitude may
be adopted by the United States and
for this reason there is -a general be
lief that any steps taken by the Unit
ed States on its own account will
come after formal delivery of the pro
posals from one set of belligerents to
the other.
It is realized that the American
course probably must be guided large
ly by the reception- given the Teutonic
ofter in the entente - countries, al
though it is regarded as certain that
either informally or formally, quietly
or publiciy, the government here will
find a way of displaying its Interest
in the restoration of peace.
Entente Reply Not Expected Soon,
Most officials think that a consider
able time will elapse after the com
munication is delivered before a for
mal reply is framed by the allies, and
that in the meantime a very clear idea
of what that reply is to be and how
any attempt at mediation by neutra's
would be viewed will be gained
through diplomatic channels.
The trend of public opinion In
Great Britain, France and Russia is
being followed closely and the Amer-
(can ambassadors in those countries
have been instructed- to forward
promptly- any- available . indication of
u-uimai vxtrwa.
President Conferred- With Er-Mv House
r- President- Wilson had only one con
ference on he sub ject today ' and that
was with -Colonel E. M. House, his
personal -friend and advisor. It was
suggested during the day that the
president migh t discuss the situation
In general terms before the conference
of governors here tomorrow, but he
had not decided tonight whether he
would accept an invitation to address
the governors and had given no indl
cation of what might be the subject
If he did speak.
Much interest is felt here' In the
speech to be delivered tomorrow night
at St. Louis before the ieague to Jfin
force Peace by Senator Stone, chair
man of the senate foreign relations
committee. There is no understand
ins. however, that the senator, if he
touches upon the latest development,
will do so as a spoKesman oi tne ao
ministration.
Bernstorff to Visit Lansing.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, probably will visit Secre
tary Lansing in a day or two for the
purpose of seeking some indicotion
of the views of the United States, ri
has no specific instructions from his
government on this point and no des
patch regarding the peace proposals
has been received by the embassy
during the last 24 hours. The am
bassador, however, is keeping his gov
ernment informed of prevarring opin
ion on the question in America.
At least one diplomat representing
a neutral nation in Washington has
planned to ask his government to au
thorize him to present in its behalf
to President Wilson assurance of sup
port in any move designed to secure
consideration by the entente allies of
the offer to discuss peace. Other rop
resentatives of neutral nations have
similar action under consideration.
. What Germany Expects.
In Teutonic diplomatic quarters it
was reiterated tonight that Germany
j expects . neutrals, especially those in
Europe,' to do everything possiDie to
bring aiKKit at least a discussion or
peace terms. No information regard
ing the intentions of Switzerland and
Spain, the other neutral nations
through wh:cn tne proposals are oeing
transmitted, has been received here.
