The Missouri County Fair Managers
Ass'n met at the Ringo Hotel in this
city Wednesday afternoon and decided
on the appointment of a special com
mittee to attend the next meeting of
the Missouri legislature in an ef
fort to see that the appropriation
bill for state aid is passod. This hill
will settle the requisitions for 17 Mis
souri fairs for their shows in 1916.
The Mexico fair is one of this number.
The money was not paid because of
the shortage in the state treasury this
year. Dr. A. L. McComas, of Stur
geon, president, presided and E. A.
Trowbridge, of Columbia, secretary,
was also present.
Resolutions were passed urging the
State Board of Agriculture ti issue
yearly a bulletin giving a detailed
account of the fairs in Missouri
Another ' resolution that received a
favorable vote was that favoring
children's club work as a part of the
county fair program.
Those who attended the meeting
were: Dr. A. R. McComus, of Stur
geon, president of the association; D.
Clark Thomas, of Knox County, W
F .Bergman, Cape Girardeau County;
R. L.: Hill, Boone County; C. O
Houston, Sheridan County; and Mitch
ell White. Audrain County, and Prof.
E. A. Trowbridge, of the University
of Missouri, secretary of the Association.

The Kansas City Ambulance Corps,
of which Sydney Houston, of this city,
i formerly City Editor of the Ledger, is
i a member, left Laredo, Texas, Mon
day for Fort Riley, Kansas. They
will arrive at Fort Riley Wednesday.
Sidney is now connected with the
Kansas City Star and hai done some
splendid reportorial work while on
the border.
Whether or not this order means
that the members of this organisation
who have been stationed on the bor
der since July, are to be mustered jut
in time to spend Christmas at home,
is not known.
In a telegram to his mother, Mrs.
A. S. Houston, Sidney aays the mem
bers of the corps have no idea what
the order means, but are hoping with
alt their might that it is preliminary
to their release from service, as most
of the Kansas City organizations
which were called to the border have
been released.
Secretary of War Newton D. Baker
will be in Kansas City Wednesday
and the women of that city will per
sonally petition him for the immedi
ate release of the Ambulance Corps,
so that members of the organization
may reach their homes before Christ
mas.
Sidney's many Mexico friends will
be glad to see him and give him the
glad hand. They Become back."

CHILD LAWS SHOULD

THAT the laws of Missouri apply

nnncimr Uncle Sam as the biggect

a nrohibition state and we law
forbids newspapers in that slate to
,ink hooze advertisements, the Kan

Uncle Sam's mails carry the circulars
f (ho mail order booze houses into
the state by the sack full, and carry
h. r,Wa out. and the express com
nnniafl PtirrV in tho beer and whisky.
and thus the government helps cir-
the laws of Georgia.
The Atlanta Constitution and the
Ammsta Chronicle are conducting
mnaiim aeainst this "federal null
ification" and are calling upon con
gress at the coming session to pass
laws that will stop it, just as con-
mn harred tho Louisiana lottery
vm the mails, and forbade inter
state commerce in articles made by
child labor.
It is a reasonable request. Certainly
the Government has no right ?o
help people break state laws.

CHICAGO, Dec. 12. "Vastly more
important than the mere wet or dry
issue is that of law enforcement; on
respect for and obedience to the law
depends the very life of our Republic.
And the greatest body of law breakers
in the United States 'are the liquor
mtorts." Mavor William Hale
Thompson, of Chicago was talking
"The liquor interests'are not sincere
in their profession to;obey the law.
They cannot . be trasted. The big
breweries own a great rfumber of li-
ouor licenses. They furnish licenses
and furniture and credit I suppose
to ex-convicts and other irresponsi-
bles.
"If the liquor interests were sin
cere we should have less trouble. But
when the big brewery owners intrust
the conducting of their saloons to that
class of people, we are bound to have
'cheating' on Sunday and all other
forms of lawlessness.
"I am going to enforce the laws,
at whatever cost to my personal or
political fortunes. But the mayor's
instrument for enforcing the law is
the police force, and I find the cur-
rupt hand of the whisky interest
reaching out everywhere among the
police."

ASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Deaths
among Cival War veterans made large
gaps in the government's pensio.i

Commissioner Saltzgaber of the pen

shows that the names of more than
fifty thousand old soldiers passed
from the list, reducing their total to
286,080, hardly more than third of
what it was eighteen ycVrs ago.
There was a net reduction in all pen
sioners of thirty-eight thousand, and
in the amount paid for pensions of six
million dollars. Pensions aggregat
