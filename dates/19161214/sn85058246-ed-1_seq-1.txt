DOG KILLED I
AT PARADISE ! 1
WITHRABIES 1
A startling story of a dog with 11
tho dread dlscaso know ns rabies Pl
wns brought to Logan yesterday by MH
Earl and H. G. Shtploy. Theso !
young men nro positive that tho nnl- il
mal wns suffering from thn dlscaso fH
as thoy havo n lottor from Dr. L. 31
L. Dallies of Salt Lako City who fl
made the oxamlnntlon nnd says this ' 'M
Is tho first dcflnlto cvldonco of f
rabies to bo received from this val- M
;
Tho day this dog was killed, It fH
camo to Paradlso from Avon. It 11
seemed to bo vicious and attacked hrl
everything In sight, ospocla'l? other Hl
dogs. It would pounce upon ovory 11
dog it saw and In many instances iH
bit them up pretty badly. It ebas- 11
ed a small boy onto n foncoand ft
held hi en there until another dog il
camo along, and then It left thn boy
to attack the dog. It entered tho il
door of a homo In 1'afadlso nnd iH
tho man of the houso boat it out 811
with' a broom, Froni tho : houso it ffl
went to tho bnrn aniU attacked tho &H
two Shipley boys above mentioned. lll
After lighting It away, it nttacked a '
horso and then returned to renew '11
its nttnek on tho boys. They pick- 11
od up clubs and killed It aftor much 11
dimcuUy.
Thinking itho animal was nflllctcd MM
wltlivtho disease, thoy Immediately 11
cut off'tho head and sent it to Dr. M
Dalncs'for an annalysis. ImmodI- ' J
atcly' thoy got- their reply that tho '11
cvldonccs of rabies was most pro-
nounced.
Through Instructions of Dr. Beat- IH
ty of Salt Lako, tho members of tho 11
town board of PnradtEo havo ordered 11
n numiinr of ogs killed nnd othors 'i
which mny havo encountered tho dls- 11
onscd dog and no evidence, nt hand ifl
as to whether or not thoy did, theso gjl
dogs nro ordered muzzled. Evory , WM
precaution will ho tnken to seo that Sl
tho spread of tho dlscaso Is checked. 911
However, It Ih' repotted that tho i'l
chance for tho spread of tho dlscaso 11
Is mighty good and this being tho Wl
c.-i3o, people throughout tho county Ul
should bo on tho lookout. fll
