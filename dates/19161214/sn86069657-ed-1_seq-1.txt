Radical Changes in Tax
Laws Ree&mniended
Tho Thx Oorn'iuiss'tori appointed
by thoUnst' session of the Legis-
Inture-lraS reported, making very
radical changes in our taxing
law8,'and'all in favor of the "inon
eyed man. Among the provisions
are: A permanent tax com mis
stoti which sits ali the time; a
intangible property is exempted
from county and all local taxa
tion. 4 his means franchises on
railroads which alone will lower
Powell county's taxable property
$225,000 ou accouut of tho L. &
N. railroad to say nothing about
other classes of intangible prop
erty.
Following is the property pro
posed to be exempt from county,
city and school district taxation
(1). Farm implements and
farm machinery owned by a per
son actually engaged in farming
and used in his farm operations.
(2). Machinery and products
in course of manuf icture of per
so'nB, firms, or corporations, act
ually eugagdd in manfacturing,
and their jaw material actually
on hand at their plants for the
purpose of manufacture. ,
(8). Money in hand, notes,
bonds, accounts and other cred
its, wlietljer secured by mortgage
pledgeor-otherwise, or unsecured
- One good feature' of The pro
posed law is it provides that the
tax jcommission shall ma"ke ihe
raise of the Various counties be
fore the County Board of Super
visors sit 80-that these upervis-
ors may distribute
the persons whom
the raise to
they think
should have it, instead of being
general to all taxpayers alike
whether they list their property
at a fair cash value or not
All bank deposits are to be tax
ed by the Stale 10 cents on the
one4iundred dollars for State pur
poses The county and other lo
cal districts can collect no tax on
money or cash in bank.
It's Doctor Easter, Now.
Eld. A. Easter went to Louis
ville the 12th inst., to appear be
fore the State Board of Veterina
ry Examiners, under act of Mar.
24th, 1910.
Eld. Easter, with many others,
was granted a license' as a non
'graduate veterinarian, to practice
veterinary medicine, surgery and
doutistry, in Kentucky; which
eutltlea him to be placed ou the
roll as Dr. Easter, and also makes
him eligible for the office of
Co,untyLivo Stock Inspector.
Dr. Easter has been-'pract icing
veterinary work in this State and
Missouri for 44 years, so there
wus uo doubt as to his ability to
practice, but the new law re
quires all persons so practicing
to have license after Jan. 1, 1017.

TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS-
Every item that goes into the makeup of The Tunes has more than doubled
ja cost in the past few years. In addition to this all forms of living expens
es have also nearly doubled. These conditions make an increase in our
rates for both subscription and advertising absolutely necessary to enable us
to exist without a loss. If every subscriber should pay cash at the old rate
of subscription, based on the present cost of producing the paper, we would
lose $1 66 per year, and our time in getting it out. JTo overcome this loss
we have raised the subscription price of the paper to ONE DOLLAR
per year, and no subscriptions after Jan. 1, 1917 will be received "for less
than that amount. But in order to equalize matters as much as possible.we
will accept subscriptions to The Times at 75 cents per year until Jan. 1st.
If you desire to save 25 cents on your 1917 subscription, see that the pa
per is paid for before Jan. 1st, as positively after thatdate no subscriptions
will be received for less than one dollar per year. Until Jan. 1st, 75 cents.
