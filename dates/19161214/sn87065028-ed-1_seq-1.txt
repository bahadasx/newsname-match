Citizens Preparing to Avail
Themselves of Opportunities
Offered by Uncle Sam.
Planters and property holders re
siding in the northeastern section of
Lowndes county will hold u meeting
at New Salem next Saturday for the
purpose of forming a farm loan as
sociation, thus placing themselves n
a position to obtain money from the
farm loan bank which i$ soon to be
established by the federal govern
ment at some point in this section
for the purpose of making loans to
land owners who are engaged in agri
cultural pursuits.
Farmers who expect to obtain
money from the proposed farm loan
banks must first organize farm loan
associations, and this will be the first
step taken in Lowndes county to
wards the formation of such an or
ganization. The meeting was proposed by
Prof. B. G. Hull, an enterprising
planter of the community in which
it is to be held, who has made a
close study of the farm loan bank
plan, and who realizes the necessity
for forming the proposed organiza
tion among the farmers.
Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Trotter, Mrs.
S. A. Scott, Miss Lucy Mae Trotter,
Mrs. Burr Ramage and Mr. J. D.
Carter were among the West Point
people in Columbus Monday.'

San Antonio. Texas, Dec. 13.
Maj. Gen. Frederick Funston, com
manding the department of the south
has replied to the Rev. J. S. Gam
b'rell, secretary of the executive
boarof the Baptist general conven
tion, explaining the general's reason
for pot permitting revivals in the
military camps here and along the
border. Numerous Baptist conven
ventions have adopted resolutions
condemning what t"hy. understood to
have been the general's action, and
suggestions were made that Presi
dent Wilson, as commander-in-chief
of the army, be asked to take official
cognizance of the matter. A reso
tion asking for information On the
controversy also has been introduced
in congress.
Gen. Funston gave out copies of
the li'tter to the press, in which he
says in part:
"From time to time .'.have been
receiving copies of resolutions passed
by various bodies condemning my
supposed stand relative to holding re
ligious services among the troops on
the border, and also have received
a number fit very unjust and in gome
cases abusive letters from clergymen
of the same denomination. Inciden
tally I have more letters approving
my stand than I have criticising it
, "This whole disagreeable incident,
with all its annoyance to me, of
course, arises from the statement
made by you after your visit to the
headquarters a couple of months ago
in which you sought to obtain per
mission to conduct a series of re
vivals in the border camps. You
stated your business to Col. Barnum,
chief of staff. If Col. Barnum stated
at that time what denomination you
belonged to, it made no impression on
my mind, and if he had it would have
made no diffei ice whatever.
"I told that officer to explain to
you fully that while religious ser
vices along the usi , lines were con
ducted in the camps by chaplains and
other clergymen and were welcomed
I could not give any consent to the
holding of revivals, therein giving the
word, as I was justified in doing, its
usually accepted meaning. I told
Col. Barnui.. to explain to you why
revival services would be out of
place in a military camp, citing the
disgraceful performance in San An
tonio last winter as an example of
what revivals are apt to'develop into,
and drawing to a certain extent and
AN ADDITIONAL
$25,000 NEEDED
Chamber of Commerce Discus
es School Matter and Jack
con Highway.
At a meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Chamber of Commerce
which was held Tuesday nisht it was
decided to at once inaugurate a cam
paign for an additional bond issue
in the sum of $23,000 for the pro
posed new high school, and the Civic
Chamber will stand behind the
scheme and push the movement just
as the original bond issue was
pushed.
This decision followed a talk by
Hon. B. A. Weaver, a member of the
city council, who told the directors
that it would be impossible to erect
a building commensurate with the
needs of Columbus with the money
on hand. As is well known, the
council paid $15,000 for a site, and
as the original bond issue was for
but $50,000 this left only $35,000
with which to erect and equip the
structure. Building materials, like
all other commodities, are at present
very high, and the lowest bid receiv
ed was in the neighborhood of $37,
000. This was for the building
alone, exclusive of heating and
plumbing, and it is estimated that
fully $25,000 more will be required
to erect and equip the character of
structure desired.
Hon. Thos. J. Locke, Jr., local
member of the executive committee
of the Jackson Memorial Highway
Association, appeared before the di

said that Hon. J. M. McBeath of
Meridian and Hon. W. T. Simpson of
Florence, whov fought shoulder-to-shoulder
with him in an effort to se
cure the adoption of the Mississippi
rouio, were in favor of the plan pro
posed by citi.ens of Birmingham and
Huntsville. Directors of the Civic
Chamber are not, however, in sym
pathy with this plan, and it was de
cided to get into telephonic communi
cation with Messrs. McBeath and
Simpson, and request them to fight
the proposition when it comes up for
consideration at the meeting of the
executive committee which is to be
held in Birmingham on December 28.
a general knowledge as to how re
vivals or 'protracted' meetings, as
they are sometimes called, are us
ually conducted.
"I further instructed Col. Barnum
to say to you that I did not accept,
in fact, resented, the implication that
because a man had put on his coun
try's uniform he was necessarily lost,
or worse than other men, that I
though there were people who had
stayed at home- who needed revivals
worse than the soldiers did
"Under the circumstances you can
imagine my astonishment when I read
your statements to the effect that I
had said that I would not allow the
soldiers to be told that they were
lost.' You must know as well as I
do that the doctrine that should be
preached to the men was never once
considered or mentioned and with all
due courtesy, I feel compelled to say
that your makinir repeatedly the
statements you are quoted as making
was absolutely inexcusable and did
me a grave injustice.
"The only time the word 'lost' was
used by me was when I said that I
did not accept the view that because
a man put on his country's uniform
he was necessarily lost.
"I say frankly that I would not
want to take chances on allowing a
series of revivals or protracted meet
ings in these great camps. I am jus
tified in giving the word 'revival' its
usually accepted meaning, a series of
meetings continuing day and night
for an indefinite period with loud
exhortation and singing and much
emotionalism.
"How aboul the rights of the men
who do not want to attend revivals
and who do not wish to be disturbed
by them? Are they to be compelled
to leave the camp, which is their
ome, and wander about downtown
or through fields to get away from
them? Has a man no rights because

SOLICIT DONATIONS FOR

CITIZENS OF COLUMBUS ASKED
TO HELP PAY COST OF
CONSTRUCTION.
. ihi.ta T.' .ii.g of Pickensvillc,

Ala.,
ing subscriptions from local bankers,
merchants and automobile 'men to
help pay for a modern highway which
citizens of Pickens county are con-
....
structing from Aliceville, Ala., via
Pickensville, to Columbus.
The road bed has already been
completed, and Mr. Long states that
it is now being surfaced with gravel,
between thirty and forty teams being
engaged in the work. The road is
about 3 miles long, and it is esti
mated that about $900 will be re
quired to surface it properly.
Pickensville is an inland town, and
as Columbus comes in competition for
its trade with Gordo, Reform and
other towns the new road will be of
inestimable value to local merchants.
The merchants fully realize this fact,
and subscribed liberally to the fund
to build the highway.
May Irwin Hera Tonight.
Jolly May Irwin the inimitable and
ever popular comedienne, willie the
attraction at the Columbus The&lre
this evening in her latest and fy
critics said to be her greatest suc
cess, "33 Washington Square." The
play is founded on the novel of the
same name by Leroy Scott, and was
dramatized by him for Miss Irwin.
Both the actress and play have been
given cordial welcomes at New York,
Boston and Chicago, last season. May
Irwin will bring her New, York cast
and production here with her.
The play tells the amusing adven
tures of Mrs. DePuyster, a social
leader of No. 33 Washington Square,
and her housekeeper, Matildu (May
Irwin). Mrs. DePuyster, owing to
a sudden shortage of money, aban
dons a trip to Europe to rema'mSe
cretly in her home. Her housekeep
er alone knows the secret.
The, fun of the play develops in
thtir attempts to keep Mrs. DePuys -
ter's presence from the knowledge
of her family, friends and servants.
Miss Irwin's fun-making alone would
probably be sufficient to carry the
nlav to success, but nevertheless she
has surrounded herself with an ex
ceptional supporting company.
Durmg the action of the play Miss
Irwin will (as has been her custom
for years) sing a number of the lat
est songs in her inimitable manner,
among them will be "Buzzen
Around," a song that promises to
rival the famous "Alexander's Rag
Time Band" in popularity; "Those
Were Happy Days," "Where did
Robinson Rrusoe Go With Friday on
Saturday Night'Pray for Sun
shine but be Prepared for Rain" and
others.

Paris, Dec. 13. "A Clumsy Trap"
is the caption under ; which Paris
morning papers print Chancellor von
Bcthmann-Hollwegg'a speech in the
reichstag Tuesday, with regard to
Germany's move for peace.
The Petit Journal says' in part:
"Tho treacherous German move aims
at something else 'than genuine
peace; it seeks an internal and ex
ternal effect." "
The Matin characterizes the peace
proposals of the German chancellor
as "mere talk." fc
Alfred Capsuin,, in Figaro, speaks
of the German proposal as "a trap"
and slys "it will be met by us and our
allies vith grim contempt."
The German maneuver for peace,
Cupsuin says, "is too clumsy to be
worthy of indignation."
London, Dec. 13. London, like
Paris, i rather inclined to scoff at
the pence proposals sent out from
Berhn Tuesday, though the tone of
British newspaper comment is rather
more subdued than that of Paris pa
pers. Government officials U"cfine
to discuss the proposals officially, but
there is an apparent undercurrent of
disapproval of the plan observable in
this quarter. ,'
Berlin, Dec. 12.--Following is the
text of the note addressed by Ger -
many and her allies to the hostile
governments:
"The most terrific war ever expe
rienced in history has been raging
for the labt two years and a half
over a large part of the world a
catastrophe which thousands of yei as
of common civilization was unable
to prevent and which injures the
most precious achievements of hu
manity. "Our aims are not to shatter nor
annihilate our adversaries. In spite
of our consciousness of our military
and economic strength and our
readiness to continue the war, which
has been forced upon us, until the
bitter end, if necessary, st the same
time prompted by the desire to avoid
further bloodshed and make an end
to the atrocities of war, the four al
lied powers propose to enter forth
with into peace negotiations. The
propositions which they bring for
ward for such negotiations and which
have for their object a guarantee of
the existence of the honor and liber-
'ty of evolution for their nations are,
accoi ding to their firm belief, an ap-
. propi iate busis for the establishment
of a lasting peace.
"The four allied powers have been
obliged to take up arms to defend
justice and the liberty of national
evolution. The glorious deeds of our
armies L ive in no way altered their
puriose. We always maintained the
firm belief that our own rights and
justified claims in no way control
the rights of these nations.
"The spiritual and material prog
ress which were the pride of Europe
at the beginning of the twentieth
century are threatened with ruin.
Germany and her allies, Austro-Hun-gary.
Bulgaria and Turkey, gave
proof of unconquerable strength in
this struggle. They gained gigantic

EXCURSION TO BE RUN FOR

BOY'S PIG CLUB.
Many citizens of Columbus and
Lowudc county' are preparing : to
visit the Mississippi A. & M. College
near Starkville today, when an ex
cursion will be run from Columbus
to the big institution.
The excursion was arranged for the
purpose of allowing members of the
First State Bank's Boy's Pig Club
an opportunity to inspect the insti
tution, and they will make the trip
as guests of Mr. J. M. Morgan, vice
president of the bank, while low rates
will be given all citizens who desire
to avail themselves of the opportuni
ty to see the institution, its model
stock farm, up-to-date dairy and
other attractive features.

"The last attack in the Balkans
has been rapidly and victoriously
overcome. The most recent events
have demonstrated that further con
tinuance of the war will not result in
breaking the resistance of our forces
and the whole situation with regard
to our troops justifies our expecta
tion of further successes.
"If in spite of this offer of peace
and reconciliation the struggle should
go on, the four allied powers are re
solved to continue to a victorious
end, but they disclaim responsibility
for this before humanity and history.

proposal for peace is regarded here
as having broken the chains which
for months have restrained the Unit
ed States, as well a other neutral,
from making offers of mediation.
Now that one set of belligerents
has signified its willingness to dis
cuss peace terms on conditions often
reiterated as necessary to any action
by President Wilson, there are indi
cations that when the United States,
acting as the intermediary, trans
mits the German proposals it may ac

officials of the American government
believe a league or nations such as
President Wilson has suggested must
b the outcome and it could not be
perfected without the participation
of the l'nited States.
Whether the L'nited States will
transmit the German proposal with
out any comment whatever, or ac
company it with some formal or in
formal expres.-im, will not be final
ly decided until. th hole delivered
to American Charge Crew in Perlin
reaches President Wilson's hand,
probably tomorrow.
There were indications that Presi
dent Wilson might find some way to
express the solemn and earnest wish
of the United States for a careful
consideration of the suggestion of
peace, even before the entente gov
ernments have made known their at
titude toward the German proposals.
This, it was pointed out, necessarily
would be done in such a delicate and
ultraconfidential way that it never
would be publicly known should the
allies decline the offer. This course
'was said to be absolutely necessary,
m m to leave the United States free
and unembarrassed to act when an
