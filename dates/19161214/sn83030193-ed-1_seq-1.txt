Says Wife Should Work to
Support Babies Deserted
By Her Son.
Refusing absolutely to obey the
order of Mnglstrato Miller In the
Jnmalca Court to-day, directing her
to support her three grandchildren,
whoso father disappeared a year ago,
Mrs. Clara H. Bessenger, sixty years
old, was sentenced to nix months In
the workhouso In default of n bond
of J2C0.
Scoies of friends offered to put up
the bond, but Mrs, Messenger ro
Jccted aid and snld she was willing
to go to Jail and ntay there In sup
port of her belief that sho should not
bo compelled to support the children
of her son,
Mrs. Ilessonger was takon Into
court several weeks ago on tho com
plaint of her daughter-in-law, Mrs.
Edna H. Jones of No. 2379 Jnmalca
Avenue, Richmond Hill. Mrs, Jones
said her husband had disappeared and
loft her with tho three children, Myr
tle, four years old; C:vlii, three, and
Arthur, two. Sho said sho was un
ablo to support them-
Tho decision of tho magistrate or
dering Mrs. Hcssenger to support the
children was appealed by Edgar S.
Hazclton, her counsel, and when Jus
tlce Kelly decided tho order was valid
Mrs. Ilcssenger was calledlnto court
for sentence to-day.
"I am not a wealthy woman," Mrs.
Hcssenger said, "and all tho property
I have Is my home at No. 1C3 Cedar
Avenue, Illchmond Hill. My daughter-in-law
will not work to support
her children and, while I reallio my
son Is the ono who should support
thorn, ho has disappeared and I can
not further help the children. I
have children of my own to protect.
"This thing has now becomo a mat
ter of principle and not of sentiment
with mo and I am determined to go
through with It. I will servo tho
whole six months. I hopo over, In
Iilnckwell'a Island I can do a llttlo
good among tho women less fortunate
than myself, nnd porhnps tho six
months I will spend there will not bo
as tcrrlbla as It seems. I will posi
tively not permit ono of my friends to
file a bond."
Lawyer Hozleton asked for a stay
of Judgment pending an appeal to
tho Appellato Division, but Magis
trate Miller sold ho thought some
thing should bo dono to Insure tho
children food during tho court pro
cecdlngs and ho would Insist that
tho woman be hold until a bond la
provldod.
"My mother-in-law has plenty,"
Mrs. Jones said, "and In spite of her
statements to tho contrary, sho has
dono nothing for us, I have dono
what I could to help care for my
children and I believe she should bo
mado to uharo tho responsibility
which Is hor son's."

WILSON FORWARDS
PEACE PROPOSAL
WITHOUT COWIWIENT
President Decides to Take No
Step at This Time May
Do So Later.
By Samuel M. William.
(Special Staff Correspondent of The
Evening World.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. Tho
United States Government will not
at this tlmo mako any effo:-. to urge
upon Grcnt Britain nnd her allies
speclnl consideration of tho peace
prnposnlM submitted by Oermany.
Olllclnl text of the note, already
announced by Chancellor Von Both-mann-Hollweg,
was received from
Berlin at tho Department of State
this morning. After decoding, It was
laid before President Wilson. It was
substantially tho same as the pub
llshcd text, there being only slight,
unimportant differences, conllncd
chiefly to rearrangement of se
quences of paragraphs.
Secretary of Stnto Lansing said
that thcro was no speclnl communi
cation accompanying tho ofllclal text,
save a request that It be forwarJid
to governments of Allied Powers,
whom Mm United States represented.
This would bo done probably to-day,
ho said.
Asked whether thn t'nlted States
Government was pieparlug any ex
prrsslon of its own on pence to ac
company the transmission of thn
German note Secretary Lansing re
plied that nothing had been donn.
At least ono of tho European neu
trals hero already has sent a despatch
to his homo government asking to bo
authorized to awm rn President Wilson
of the support of his government In
sending omo expression to thn En
tente Allies designed to Influence
thorn to give consideration to the of
fur to discuss peace. There am Indi
cation tliit Homo of thu other neu
trals may follow suit,
Tho German Embn-isy to-day had
no now advices on the situation and
th"j Turkish and Bulgarian represen
tatives wero entirely without any do
apatthuji from homo.
Tho Spanish Ambassador, Mr,
Ittano, was an early caller at tho
State Department and conferred with
Secretary Lansing. Ho said he had
advices from Madrid that his Govern
ment also had recolved tho German
note for transmlssluu to those En
tente countries where It represents
tho Central Powers diplomatically,
nnd that tho note delivered thero was
the same oh that cabled to the United
States.
The Swiss Minister, Dr- Bitter, also
called ou Secretary Lansing, IBs
visit, coupled with tho fact that one
other neutral Is moving to support
the President In any effort to sccuro
a cnnslderatoii of pence, led to tho
belief that somo light on tho attitude
of the United States toward such a.
general movement by neutrals was at
least being sounded out.

Berlin Reported to Be in Favor of a

ary Kaiser at Home Waiting for
Answer.
1,000,000 MORE TROOPS .
CALLED OUT BY BRITAIN
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. The Embassies of the
entente allies here to-day reflected the view that Germany's
peace proposals will not be rejected without examination
but that the allies in reply probably will call for a statement
of proposed terms, so they may not be placed in the position
of unqualifiedly rejecting peace.
LONDON, Dec. 14. Andrew
chequer, spoke of Germany's peace
to-day.
"Something has happened of
say a word," said Mr. Law. "Naturally ths papers are full of the peace
proposals from Berlin. Until now no proposal has reached His Majesty's
Government.
"In moving the last vote of
used the words: 'They (the allies)
security for the future,'
"That Is still the policy and still the determination of His Majesrs
Government."
The statement was received with prolonged and general cheers.
"The man who asks for peace Is generally the man who has had
enough," declared Gen. Maurice, Director of Military Operations, to-day.
These peace proposals should be a great encouragement to us. Chan
cellor Hollweg's speech can be traced directly to developments on the
Somme.
"Independent British and French estimates Show that the Germans
have lost over 700,000 men since July i, Including 95,000 who were cap
tured. In addition they lost 135 heavy guns, 18o field pieces and 1,314
machine guns.
"It is especially significant that the German losses were from their
best fighting forces."
A despatcli from Berne says the Kaiser returned to Berlin Tuesdav
evening, where he will remain until the answer of the Entente Powers
to the German peace proposal is received.
BERLIN PLANS CONFERENCE
ON PEACE IN JANUARY
Government Believes
Views at The Hague Would Bring
About Agreement.
BERLIN, Dec. 14. Imperial German officials are convinced that
the peace proposals made by Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg are based
upon sound principles that eventually will lead to peace.
The underlying purpose of the Central Powers Is to bring together
at The Hague representatives of all the belligerents, ip the hope that an un
restrained, face-to-face exchange of views as to the causes of the war and
the things for which the belligerents are fifhting, will result in a innda
mental arrangement that will end the war. German statesmen believe
that once these representatives gathered around a table and talked frankly
with each other, they would not adjourn until they had evolved a pan
that would make peace a certainty.
The Imperial Government desires to have this informal discussion
take place at Tne Hague in January. It is understood the German Gov
ernment will not insist that the Entente Powers agree In advance to Jiv
