cer's Disappointment.
London. Eng., Dec. 14. The house oi
lords refused the appeal in the Slings-
by legitimacy case today without call
ing upon the respondents.
In giving judgment, the house of
lords held that it had been established
that 'he child in question was the son
of Lillian Anderson and that it also
had been proved that the child was
tu.nded over to Sirs. Slingsby. The
house of lords expressed regret at the
pain caused by the decision to "the
gallant officer who is now serving his
i country-
ommander bllngsby.
In the house of lords lay the last
hope of the Slingsby claimants in the
contest which has been before the
courts of England and the United States
for several years. An inheritance was
left in England to the first male heir
of three brothers of the name of Slings
by. The estate in Yorkshire is valued
at about $500,009. The case grew out
of the attempt of one brother to estab
lish himself as the father of an heir
and the denial by the other.. As the
alleged heir was born outside the em
pire it was necessary to establish the
f!.ct of his legitimate birth.
In December, 1912, a petition was
presented in the probate court for a de
cree that Charles Eugene Slingsby was
the lawful son of Charles R. Siingsby
ond Dorothy Slingsby. It was said the
; child had been born in San Francisco
( in 1910. Thomas and Alan Slingsby.
LTOtners oi commander Charles Slings
by alleged no heir had been born, that
the Infant's mother was Lillian Ander
son and Its father Paul Colvin: that
the child had been noreured fnr the
petitioners and passed off by them as
their lawful offspring, the birth record
being altered.
f a California court ruled that the
child was the lesrltlmat heir 4.1
English court upheld that dectstas. The
verdict was taken to the courtof ap
peals, which declared the child was
illegitimate From this court the case
was carried to the house of lords

The situation is that Germany aa

"There is the best reason for know

Mr. Redfield. "These demands will
be for foodstuffs of many kinds, for

the secretary, in the fact that her ad

President "Wilson May For
ward It "With Suggestion
For Consideration.
Washington. D. C Dec 14. The note
conveying the proposal for peace by the
central powers which the United States
is to transmit to the entente belliger
ents arrived during the night and was
ceing prepared for president Wilson
early today.
The document was said to be sub
stantially the same as published In the
unofficial dispatches from Berlin in the
report of the Overseas News agency.
Accompanying it was a confidential re
port from American charge Grew, un
derstood to be an outline of affairs
which led up to the German chanceloi's
speech in the reichstag and the sending
of peace proposals. As soon as presi
dent Wilson has seen the note it will
be forwarded to minister Whitlock in.
Belgium, ambassadors Sharp. Page,
Guthrie and Francis, in France, Eng
land. Japan and Russia, and to the le
gations at the Servian and Rumanian
government seats.
The actual transmission of the peace
proffer now brings up the important
question of whether president Wilson
will decide to act merelv aa an- inter
mediary or whether he will accompany
the note with some expression of hope,
that the proposals for consideration of
peace shall not be rejected without ex
amination and reflection. There is a
prevailing opinion that the president
wants to do something of the sort and
Is looking forward to some movement
of a league of nations to preserve peace
as one of the elements of the settle
ment of the war.
