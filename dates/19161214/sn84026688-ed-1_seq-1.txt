SIGHTS AT TOLEDO.
Mr. Monroe O’Toole, WiHys-Overland
dealer in this town, who ia one of
the 5,000 dealers visiting th great
Toledo plant, recounts his experien
ces in this entertaining letter to
the editor. ,<

Some action!
Nothing was ever so impressive as
our tour of the great plant fhat turns
out Willys-Overland cars.
Our Pullmans all parked in the
company yards. There was room
enough, for there are seven and throe
quarter miles of track within the
plant.
Each man got a card containing a
picture of Mr. Willys and an auto
graphed message from him. Next
thing I knew we were lined up on the
steps of the stunning new adminis
tration building getting photograph
ed.
Elevators shot us to the company’s
own restaurant on the sixth tioor.
There we had a corking breakfast. At
each plate was a copy of the live new
Willys-Overland house organ,
Starter.” It mapped our days pro
pram.
Then started our tour of the plant.
Our guides were carefully picked
men. They knew the plant from end
to end, and the parties were small so
that each member of the party could
have his questions answered.
Nobody ought to seH Willys-Over
land product without knowing this
plant. You can’t grip the immensi
ty of the proposition till you do.
It is no piker business.
825,000,000 are tied up in the
land, buildings and machinery, not
to say a word about the stock of
parts and raw material.
From the roof of the wonderful ad
ministration building, which stands
out like a state capital, you get a
great panorama of the plant. You
can then readily believe that it occu
pies 103 acres, with 4,486,680 square
feet of floor space in daily use and a
production capacity of 1000 ears per
day.
You can appreciate the growth
from 250 employes in 1908 to 17,300
in 1916,
1,000 persons, more than the en
tire manufacturing force of many a
company, work in the administration
alone. This structure, 375 feet long,
has every facility for rapid work, in
cluding dictaphones, its own telegraph
and telephone system and a mail
handling department that does alxiut
everything hut write the letters.
388 persons can he fed in the res
taurant at one time.
Hut this is nothing to what hits
when you cross into the shops. It is
a whirl of action, yet all is system.
Harts by the untold thousands are
here, with a value into the million of
dollars. There are lines of motors.
1 never saw so many crank shafts to
gether. Our guide said 6,(XX) —I’d
have believed 60,000.
There is stock in bins, stock in
yards, stock along the, walls, connect
ing rods, frames, fenders, mudguards
hoods, rims, springs, axles, torsion
tubes, transmission gears shafts, brake
parts, steering rods, pedals —it is an
unending procession.
Every thirty days secs an average
of 1000 tons of steel come in. It is
handled by a magnetic crane that en
ables two men to do the work that
formerly required thirty.
There are amazing machines.
The toggle press, for example, held
us all. This monster, with its pres
sure of 1000 tons, shapes cold steel
like cardboard- A piece of metal fed
to it comes out as a side frame. It
can make 2000 of these in an eight
hour day.
Other mighty machines stamp out
radiator shells, lenders, cowl dashes
and doors.
You take off your hat to the drop
forging machines. Down comes the
hammer and the fiery piece of iron
is beaten into shape. The complete
drop forging of the front axle can be
accomplished with one heat.
Every kind of part requiring streng
th was drop forged while we looked
on, axles, crank shafts, brake assem
bly rods, brake and control rods,
spring shackles, gear blanks and brake
rod sectors.
We saw the company’s accurate
system of die making. It calls for a
special workman on each detail. One
works on the shaper, another on the
planer and a third on die sinking.
THURMONT, FREDERICK COUNTY, MD., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1916.
The multiple spindle drill in one
operation drills all the holes in the
front axle. This is a guarantee that
each will be in right relation to the
other.
It was hard to drag us away from
the autonyibile turret lathe that sur
faces and finishes fly wheels. It
works as though within its metal vit
als a biain was concealed. The
workman has only to put on the
rough fly wheel, adjust the first set
of tools, push the lever, and let the
machine do the rest.
The cast iron is peeled off as read
ily as wax. Sometimes four or five
operations are performed at once.
When one set of cuttings is done, the
machine stops automatically, and the
next set of tools comes automatically
into place. Twenty operations are
performed in 14 minutes. 26 pounds
of metal are removed from the wheel.
Qpe man can watch three of these
machines.
The vertical cutter of gears on fly
wheels almost matches the turret
lathe in interest.
Moving up and down, the cutter at
the same time slowly revolves, the
fly wheel turning in the opposite di
rection. By the time a complete
revolution of the fly wheel *has been
accomplished, all the g' tvrs are cut.
We all fell for the aluminum foun
dry and for the machines that finish
the aluminum parts.
The multiple spindle drill laires 81
holes in the crank case in one opera
ting. This is proof of the superiori
ty of maching processes, for the holes
must be in the right relation to each
other.
Another machine smooths the sur
faces of the crank cases, finishing
seven in nine minutes.
Diamonds, real diamonds, are con
sumed with apparently reckless in
difference in the wet grind room.
Placed in small tools they are used to
true the emery wheels on which are
ground the bearing surfaces of the
crank shafts. They are bought in
815,000 lots!
We looked on while whole forests
of lumber were being turued into
bodies in the word work department.
This lumber comes in by carloads.
As 211 feet of wood is required on a
small touring car, we could readily
see why so much was required.
You make this round and you can
understand this company’s immense
consumption of material —18,000,000
pounds of solder annually; 2,500,000
pounds of tin and lead for soldering;
10,000,000' pounds of brass and cop
per; 12,(XX),000 feet of steel lulling
and 125,000 tons of steel.
But what impressed me more than
all was the department in which ma
terials are tested. They have to know
a tiling is right before it goes into' a
Willys-Overland car. That’s how
they safeguard the public.
Tests in the physical and chemical
laboratories arc made in two ways.
Completed steel parts are subjected
to terrific tests. Axles are twisted
like rolls of taffy candy. Small hits
of steel, six inches long, cut from
completed axles, are attached at both
ends, and litterally pulled apart.
The registering machine shows 200,-
000 pounds to the square inch nec
cessary to accomplish this, whereas a
resistance up to 125,000 pounds
would he proof of ample tensile
strength. Springs are tried for their
resistance.
Steel articles are also put through
both heat and chemical tests. The
former determines the amount of
carbon, an important factor; the
other determines the chemical com
position of the steel.
Naturally every operation in all
the plants tends finall toward the as
sembly conveyor tracks. There are
four of them, each 645 feet long.
We followed the whole operation.
We began at one end where the
frames and rear systems are put in
place. By the time the other end of
the conveyor is reached the frame has
grown into the finished car.
From overhead parts are lowered
by chains. Along the way men are
attaching the parts. The frame is
not in motion all the time, hut can
be instantly connected with the links
of an endless chain and sent on its
way whenever desired.
Top quality of workmanship is as
sured by having each man do work
on which he is an expert, if it he
only to tighten a bolt.
A Family Newspaper-Independent in Politics—Devoted to Literature, Local and General News.
Lines of- motors, already tested,
wait on both sides of the conveyor.
These are pu(j into place, cantilever
springs are put on, steering mechan
ism and lighting and starting systems
are adjusted. Gradually the car
takes form.
Instead of painting the chassis with
a brush, a sprayer is used. It does
the work more rapidly, more uni
formly and at a lower cost.
The tracks of the assembly lead
directly through ovens in whish the
paint it baked. Fenders and run
ning hoards come into their places.
Wheels with thd tires on are
brought along on a runway. First
comes a front wheel, then a rear
wheel. You ought to see them put
on tires. It is lightning. By a
special device, invented by one of the
men in the department, the tire can
he put on a wheel in three seconds.
From overhead bodies are dropped
down on to the chassis and soon made
fast.
The car is now ready fur its tests.
Rapidly revolving wheels in the floor
engage the wheels of the car, and
send th'.in at high speed to make
sure that they are operating freely.
This is not a test under the power of
the car.
Caroline and water are then put
into the car, It is pushed off the
track into another room, till its
wheels are in contact with wheels in
the floor.
With the use of the self starter, the
machine gets its first chance to prove
the success of its construction.
It surprised me the way the motor
started. They were off with a rush.
There was no hitch or delay. All
the work had been done right. In a
few minutes the motor was working
apparently almost as smoothly as if
it had been a year on the road.
We saw how the cars were shipped.
The export department has the big
feature in this line. The finished
ear undergoes preparation by having
its wheels taken off and fastened on
the under side of the frame which
forms the top covering of the car.
The top is covered with tar paper as
a protection against the elements,
and all is securely boxed.
Along comes a big crane running
in an overhead groove a quarter of a
mile long. The operator sits in a
small cab not unlike that of a rail
road engineer. Chains grab the box
containing the car, and within forty -
tive seconds have carried it outside
the building and place it on the flat
freight car.
It is processes like these, all that I
have descrilied, that explain why
every car in the Willys-Overland line
is what it is at so low a cost. Mak
ing so many is the answer, making
them to go all over the world and
having profited by the experience of
users everywhere. Quantity produc
tion, immense and costly machines,
skilled designing, careful inspection,
accurate tests of material, efficient
factory methods, rapid assembly and
advanced methods of handling, all
these we saw; all these tell why the
Willys-Overland Company lives up
to its ideals of a oar for every need or
taste, price, class and service right.
We saw the line. It is quality
from the lowest priced to the head
liner. It will be the marvel of the
automobile shows.
This sightseeing tour is only one
angle of this convention. The two
days’ program included a rollicking
beefsteak dinner, a more formal ban
quet, a mins rel show, a concert by
the famous Overland band and a con
cert by the Glee Club. Finally there
was a speech by the moving genius
of it all, Mr. Willys himself.
You will agree with me that this
is sortie project to have been put over
all within one plant and by the peo
ple of the organization.

FOR FLETCHER’S
CASTORIA
Living Cost Still Puzzle.
Problem May be Solved In 50
Or 500 Years Says Dr. Neaaingr
Over 2,400 people—as many as could
be packed into all the seats of the Acad
emy of Music, Baltimore, from pit to gal
lery—asked Dr. Scott Nearing for bread
Sunday afternoon, and he gave them a
choice collection of highly polished, scin
tillating verbal pebbles. He had to; by
his own admission there is no immediate
remedy in sight for the high cost of liv
ing, which was the subject of his Open
Forum address that the 2400 had appar
ently expected would light up the whole
mystery. The best immediate remedy
he could think of he gave to a man who
a o;e in the audience and said he
agreed with Dr. Nearing’s theories about
j industrial democracy, but what was he
, going to do about the poor man who need
ed a square meal right at that very min
ute?
“My advice to that poor man,” said
Dr. Nearing, “is that he go out in the
street and borrow a quarter from some
body and get a bowl of soup.”
Eager for some terse, cogent opinion
from this economist that would settle in
their minds definitely the most vexing
question of the day, the audience hurled
questions at Dr. Nearing from front seats
and gallery, asking him about food boy
cotts, Government ownership and every
thing else under the sun. He answered
them all up to 5 o’clock, and then had to
admit himself a victim of the system that
he had previously declared is rapidly driv
ing the nation to “financial imperialism.”
He had to catch a train, thereby contrib
uting his bit to the $900,000,000 that he
said the “unintelligent, uncivilized, un-
Christian” people of the country were
paying every year to the stock and bond
holders in the railroads, making “cinch
jobs” possible and driving further be
yond the pale of realization that “indus
trial democracy” which he had sail! was
the only possible remedy for the high
cost of living.
“Isn’t it time for a campaign for high
er wages?” asked one man.
“The only effect of that will he to
raise prices higher,” answered Dr.
Nearing.
“Is a food boycott undemocratic” ask
ed another.
“Not so undemocratic as it is stupid,”
answered Dr. Nearing, “because you’ve
got to eat again some time.”
“Are embargoes or the seizure of stor
age warehouses feasible remedies?’" queri
ed a third.
Dr. Nearing thought that neither of
those ideas was worth while. “What
you do today,” he said, “must relate to
what you want eventually in the way of
a permanent reform.
“Why can’t the legislative department
of the government settle the problem?”
was another question. Dr. Nearing bris
tled up and got his whole battery into
action.
“Because thepeople whosent Congress
men to Washington don’t want it settl
ed,” he snapped. “The Congressmen
will do just what they were elected to
do, and that is to see toit that the farm
ers and manufacturers ‘get theirs’ and a
little bit more. I haven’t any patience
with people who profess disappointment
that Congress doesn’t appear to he look
ing out for the interest of common folks.
If you hadn’t brains enough to know
when you voted for them just how little
you could expect along that line you have
no kick coming.”
Dr. Hearing's theory of the reason for
the high cost of living and the remedy
for it was none the leas clear because it
was unsatisfactory to his worried audi
ence. It began with the people themsel
ves, he said. They had surrounded them
selves with wrong theories of living. The
young men want “cinch jobs” and the
young women wanted to marry men who
would save them from the necessity of
housework. People had come to the
point where they bought clothes or fur
niture not because they needed them, but
because their neighbors had them. Life
;n the United States was more of a “war
against neighbors,’ than anything else.
"If the 15-inch guns that people are
hoping will guard our coasts could be
turned in toward Wall street,” said Dr.
Nearing, “there might be some hope.”
Still further “hope.” he declared, lay
in an awakening of the national intelli
gence to the necessity of a distribution
among the people of the land, the busi
ness interests and the profits of the na
tion, making producers out of the hold
ers of “cinch jobs” and real help meets
out of the women who married to escape
washing and ironing.
But—and there was the rub—that would
take 50 years (Dr. Nearing smiled when
he said it), perhaps 500 years, at which
time living problems will have been fully
solved, at least for yesterday’s audience.

THEIR FATHERS’ FRIENDS
; By CATHERINE CRANMER. |
“Anything startling in the evening
paper, dad?” asked Betty Allen ns she
perched on the arm of her father’s
chair and bent her blond head to scan
the headlines of the paper he was read
ing.
“Nothing exactly startling, but here’s
something that ought to interest us.’’
lie pointed to a paragraph, and Betty
began to read;
“ ‘Theron M. Clay, candidate con
gressional representative from the Sev
enth district, will be one of, the speak
ers at the political mass meeting at
Stanhope hall tomorrow evening. Mr.
Clay has a brilliant record as an attor
ney and is said to be a gifted orator.’
“Whew! That doesn’t sound so In
teresting to me,” said Betty, "Besides,
I’m going to Mrs. Andrews’ dinner
dance with Jerry Davis tomorrow eve
ning.”
"That’s very awkward, daughter, for
I was talking to Theron Clay today by
telephone and I invited him to have
dinner with us tomorrow evening."
“I'll tell you, daddy—l'll entertain
your Henry Clay at dinner If you’ll let
me motor to Hill Creek lodge with
Jerry tomorrow to the tennis tourna
ment.”
The tennis tournament ended at four
o’clock the next afternoon and Betty
found so many friends to greet and so
many victors to congratulate that be
fore she knew It five o’clock had come,
“Mercy me, Jerry!” she exclaimed in
dismay. “Here I am playing around
when I ought to be home sobering up
for the ordeal of being hostess to Hen
ry Clay. Let’s go at once or I’ll be late
for my own dinner party."
Jerry’s blue car shot smoothly out
on the rock roads and Betty began to
feel relieved. As they went silently
coasting down a long hill at the base
of which was a hairpin curve, Jerry
neglectg}! to obey the signboard warn
ing to blow his horn, and wiien he
made the turn ho was compelled to
veer wildly to the roadside to avoid
running Into three men replacing a tire
on a large touring car that stood at the
left of the road. In the tall grass at
the roadside, Jerry’s front tire fairly
pinioned itself on the jagged neck of
a large broken bottle, and a deafening,
long-drawn-out hiss followed.
“I beg your pardon,” said a deep
voice at the side of the car, “but our
machine Is now ready to continue Its
journey, and we shall be happy to
take the lady into town If she will
honor us by allowing us to do so."
The speaker, who was a tall, digni
fied man In dark gray tweeds and a
soft black hat, addressed himself to
Jerry, but looked at Betty for a re
ply.
The next minute she was waving
good-by to a somewhat disconsolate
Jerry, and the big car moved away.
The man who hud Invited her to ac
company them sat on the rear seat
with Betty.
“I, too, run the risk of being late
for dinner,” said her seat mute, “and
of Inconveniencing others while em
barrassing myself.”
"That’s too bad,” said Betty, sympa
thetically. The big man’s big voles
made her feel even smaller than she
was. “If it wasn’t for daddy, I wouldn’t
mind. I promised him to be nice to a
friend of his tonight, and I don't want
him to think I'm playing off.”
“That’s funny,” said the man, “for
I’m Inconveniencing myself to please
a friend of my father, too."
Betty felt a delightful sense of com
panionship sitting there beside this
man with the sympathetic voice, and
she spoke out half unconsciously:
"I hoped to get home In time to rest
for the ordeal ahead of me, but now
I’ll do well If I get into ray dinner gown
and get my salad made before Henry
Clay arrives."
Just then the chauffeur asked for
Instructions about reaching Betty’s
home, and as she bent to give them
she missed the look of amused surprise
on her companion’s face, but she
turned toward him Just In time to sea
his eyes open wide In sudden under
standing as he heard her give the
driver the same house number which
John Allen bad given him the day be
fore when Inviting him to dine with
them.
‘''Then you are Mr. Allen’s daugh
ter?” asked the man eagerly.
“Ye-es,” said Betty, looking very
straight at him. Then her blue eyes
slowly rounded with surprise. “You
can’t be Mr. Clay, can you?"
“I can’t be anybody else,” he said,
handing her his card. "And I hope
the daughter of my father’s friend will
forgive me for any rudeness implied in
what I said about its being self-sacri
fice to accept hla invitation.”
“I think It Is I who should ask to be
forgiven for my flippant use of the
name of your kinsman, Henry Clay,'*
said Betty, with a blush. When they
reached the hall, Betty laid a hand
gent ft on her father’s arm.
"Daddy, dear,” she said sweetly,
looking from him to their guest, "you
must wait until dinner is served to en
joy Mr. Clay, for he is very tired and
we must let him go upstairs and rest
for the ordeal ahead at him tonight at
the mass meeting.”
While Theron Clay rested he forgot
the political campaign and Its trying
ordeals. He was picturing Betty mak
ing salads In his future home. As for
Betty, she donned her dinner gown
and mixed her salad amid dreams of
herself seated In the gallery of the
house of representatives listening to
the masterful speech of a masterful
man she loved.

BRYAN AGAINST
OWNERSHIP BY
THE GOVERNMENT
Gives Newlands Committee His
Views on Railroad Control.
COMPETITION PREFERABLE.
Federal Regulation Should Not Be Al
lowed to Exclude Exercise of State
Authority, He Contends—Thinks Rail
road Stocks Should Represent Actual
Value and Be Stable as Governmer t
Bonds.
Washington, Dec. 11. - William J.
Bryan, who startled the country ten
years ago by advocating government
ownership of railroads, appeared be
fore the Newlands Joint Committee on
Interstate Commerce hist week In sup
port of the claim that the slates should
be allowed to retain authority over the
regulation of all transportation lines
within their borders. Mr. Bryan ex
plained that he had long regarded gov
ernment ownership as Inevitable, but
only because of railroad opposition to
effective regulation.
Against Government Ownership.
"Personally 1 cannot say that I de
sire government ownership," he ex
plained, "because I lean to the indi
vidual Idea rather than to the collec
tive Idea; that Is. I believe that gov
ernment ownership is desirable only
where competition is Impossible."
Alfred I*. Thom, counsel to the Kail
way Executives' Advisory Committee,
previously had presented before the
members of the Newlands Committee
as one of his reasons for urging a bet
ter balanced and more systematic reg
ulation of railroads the argument that
this is the only alternative to govern
ment ownership. Calling attention to
the restrictions imposed upon the
transportation lines by conflicting state
laws and regulations, to the practical
cessation of new construction and to the
impossibility under existing conditions
of securing the new capital needed for
extensions and betterments of railway
facilities, he warned the Congressmen
that unless they provided a fair and
reasonable system of regulation that
would enable the railroads to meet the
growing needs of the country's busi
ness the national government would
he compelled to take over the owner
ship of the lines with all the evils at
tendant upon such a system.
Preservation of Competition.
Mr, Bryan, on the other hand, holds
that pie further extension of federal
authority over the railroads would bo
a step In the direction of government
ownership. He advanced the view that
the centralization of control in tho
hands of the national government
would Impose too great a burden upon
the regulating lady, would offer strong
temptation to railroads to Interfere in
politics and would encourage the gen
eral movement toward centralization
of power in the federal government at
the expense of the states. He said that
he did not object to consolidations of
railroad lines so long as they did not
destroy competition, that he knew of
no complaint against great railway
systems because ot their size and that
he believed that the preservation of
competition was the test to bg applied
to all consolidations.
Regulation of Securities.
Mr. Bryan declared himself In favor
of national regulation of railway stock
and bond Issues, but added that he saw
no reason why that should exclude the
states from acting on the same sub
Ject as to stale corporations. “I would
like to see the stock of u railroad, ns
long as It Is in private hands, made as
substantial and as unvarying ns the
value of a government bond,” he as
serted.
He suggested that railroad capitali
zation be readjusted to equalize It with
actual valuation of the property rep
resented, making due allowance for
equities, and that when this was done
the roads should be allowed to earn
sufficient income to keep their stock
at par and to create u surplus. Tho
latter, he tentatively proposed, might
he allowed to amount to 25 per cent
of the capital.
