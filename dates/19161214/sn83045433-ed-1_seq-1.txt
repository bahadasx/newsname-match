The Senate leaders de not favor the

that a general graded Increase for em

Copenhagen, Dec. l-Despatches from
the Russian frontier state that Jas, the
provisional seat of the Rumanian govern
meat, has been terror stricken since the
surrender of Bucharest.
The town itself, being of provincial di
mnions. Is said to be hopelehely over
crewded with eeing Rumanians who fol
lowed their King and government. The
city has only three hotels and its crowd
ed condition, the lack of lodging facill
ties and shortage of food have brought
about miserable living conditions, reports
state.
While the fate of the Rumanian capital
seemed a foregone conclusion. it was
hoped, dispatches assert. that an
eleventh hour miracle would stave off its
doom. On the night of December 5, the
truth of the hopelessness of the situation
became known, whereupon crowds filled
the streets and proceeded to march to
the hotel where Bratlanu is quartered.

TEUTON TERMS
DRAFTED AHEAD
OF PEACE PLEA
Government Ready to Name
Conditions in Event Entente
Decides to Treat.
(my the .InternatiemaI News Seevice.)
Berlin, Dec. 12.-The terms upon which
Germany and hef allies are ready to
make peace are formulated and wi be
submitted to the entente powers as soon
as the -latter have signified their willing
Ses to enter Into negotiation.
From the expressions gathered In the
corridors of the Reichstag shortly after
yesterday's historic session it became
clear that the majority of the members
of the German Parliament heartily favor
Germany's peace move. To be sure, there
were mnan expressions on the part of the
opponents of the chancellor's policy urg
tag that peace should be made only upe"
a as of 'woe to the conquered."
The consensus of opinion, however. was
that the peace move is timely and that
whatever be the reception accorded it in
the entente countries, it will prove ad
vantageous to the central powers.
Likely to Kebeet Ofer.
London, Dec. l:.-That the entente
powers will summarily reject the peace
proposals of Germany and her allies was
taken as a foregone conclusion today. -
England and the allied nations are not
being misled into the opinion that Ger
many is weakening, according to the
view taken by the press. Even whif the
note containing the German priAais
were being written Germany was taking
steps to carry on the war more vIgdr
eatly than ever. it is declared.
SRatesdam- -re ds est- . the
Telegraph understands tha th
eace note, which was handed
es-the envoys of the United States. Spain
and Switzerland and to the Vatican as
well, was written by the Kaiser.
His telegram follows:
"I understand the notes were handed
to the Ambassadors of the neutral
powers last evening. This was done by the
chancellor in the name of the Kaiser.
The ehancellor had returned from Seld
heaifuarter on Saturday. The note
was drafted personally by the Kaiser
after a conference at headquarters wita
King Ludwig, of Bavaria. von Beghman
Uollweg and Dr. Zimmermann. the
foreign secretary.
Leaders Kept In Dark.
"The leaders of political parties in the
Reichstag were not let into the secret
until this morning when they were re
celved by the Geritan foreign secretary.
The majority of the Rei'hrtag deputies
were the very last mo
Therm had been well-founeed reports
that the momentous sessioln of the Ger
man Reichstag yesterday would deal with
peace and the offer to enter into nego
tiations did not take England and her
allies entirely by surprise.
It is a fateful coiracidence that the
peace offercones just at a time when
the British and French governments are
being strengthened for the purpose of
prosecuting the war more vigorously than
ever before.
Some of the military critics belieye
that a formal rejection of Germanfs
peace proposals will result in methods of
warfare by land and sea more ruthless
than those y4 attempted in the world
conflict. It had been intimated by Von
Hindenburg. the German chief of staff.
that a rejection of German peace over
tures would open the door for unlimited
and drastic endeavors to bring about
victory. It is possible and many persons
believe very probable, that Germany's
first step in this direction will be the
inauguration of a relentless submgrine
warfare upon allied shipping.
It is believed likely that Premier Iloyd
George will deliver a special speech upon
peace in Parliament soon setting forth
the exact and definite attitude of Eng
land and her allies.
