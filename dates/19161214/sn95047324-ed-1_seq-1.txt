Whereas,, By abolishing the
office of county treasurer the peo
ple of the state of Florida have
expressed themselves as opposed
to the payment of commissions to
officers for the handling of public
funds; and,
Whereas, The law -providing
that trustees be named for the
various bond districts also pro
vides for the payment of com
missions to the said trustees; and,
Whereas, Qualifying banks
have been designated as 'deposi
tories for other public monies,
which said banks not onlv do not
receive a commission for the hand
line of said monies, but
the public interest, on the said
monies on deposit with the said
bankr: now-, therefore,
Resolved. By the Board of.
County Commissioners of DeSoto
County, that we do hereby peti
tion the 1917 legislature of the
state of Florida to enact a law giv
ing to the county commisioners
the power and authority to let and
contract s with any bank
the handling of the said
special bond funds that will prop
erly qualify and that are the
highest and best bidders for the
said funds; and, further, that we
hereby request our senator, the
lion. A. II. Wilson, and our repre
sentative, the Hon, W. C. Lang
ford, to use their influence in se
curing the passage of the above
described law, the public welfare
in our opinion, demanding it. A
d opted.
Whereas, The Acts of the Leg
islature of 1915 providing deposi
tories for the various county funds
necessitates the inauguration of a
needlessly complicated account
ing system ; and,
Whereas, The said act does
give the banks of the various
counties certain authority over
the funds of the said counties, re
gardless of the interest of the tax
payers thereof, by making it man
datory upon the Boards of County
Commissioners to equitably divide
the said funds among the said
banks which qualify as said de
positories, and,
Whereas, This mandatory
provision will, in the majority of
cases, defeat the very reason for
the said act, viz : The payment of
interest on the deposits of the
several counties: and,
Whereas, The said act attempts
to work additiontal hardships up
on the taxpayers of the said coun
ties, to the beneht of the said
banks, by providing that no war
rant shall be drawn except where
there are funds in the said bank
on which the warrant is drawn,
thus attempting to restrict the
the right of the county commis
sioners to expend, if necessary,
95 per cent, of the amount of tax
levied, and bringing in an element
of uncertainty in the making of
the annual budget, which is un
reasonable, and which will neces
sitate a larger tax levy than the
requirements of the county de
mand, or that the financial busi
ness of the county be not transact
ed until near this end of the tax
vear :
Now, therefore, Be it resolved,
By the Board of County Commis
sioners of DeSoto County, that our
senator, the Hon. A. M. Wilson,
and our representative, the Hon.
W. C. Langford, be, and they are
hereby requested to use their
whole influence and power in the
coming session of the legislature
of the state of Florida to have the
said act repealed, and made of no
effect, and that there be enacted
in lieu thereof an act giving to
the county commissioners of the
said counties the right and au
thority to contract with a bank
which is the highest and best bid
der, to act as depository for the
various county funds for a two-
year period, and' not restricting
the issue of warrants by the said
boards of county commissioners,
except as provided in the act
which limits the same to 95 per
cent, of the annual tax levy. A-

pany of Chicago, 111., for the

because of lack of standardization
and that the fruit was discriminat
ed against in the market because
customers could not depend upon
the grade of fruit.
It will also be. remembered that
a committee was appoiuted to se
lect the orange varieties which
should be standardized and that
the Seminar approved their
choice. The varieties selected
were Parson Brown, Homosassa,
Pineapple, Valencia and Lou Gim
Gong, , , ;
That an attempt to standardize
varieties was wise is shown by a
survey made by the United Stat
es Bureau' of Crop Estimates. This
survey was undertaken to learn
percentages of trees of the differ
ent varieties C. C. Hare, field' a
gent for the Bureau in Florida
calls attention to the report:
I he percentages of trees of
bearing age of the different vari
eties are as follows: Homosassa
2.2 percent; King 2.2 Lou Gim
Gong.2.2; Parson Brown 3; Pine
rpplo 13.5; Ruby Blood 2.3; seed

22.6.

Growers who- are setting groves
have evidently seen the light

Lettuce is the housewife's best
friend in planning a meal. It is
edible and universally liked. A
dinner needs a salad course and
lettuce may always be counted on
to furnish a base for it. Again it
is good for decorating the table
dishes. A spoonful of hash plac
ed on a lettuce leaf will be eaten
with relish where one on a bare.
plate will be scorned. The let
tuce leaf furnishes the appeal and
whets the appetite. r ,
Big Boston lettuce is perhaps
the best known variety in Florida.
This is the favorite hard head let
tuce with those who grow for the
market. The Salamander is a
very fine loose head lettuce and is
a favorite in many heme gardens.
The Romaine type of lettuce may
prove to be the housewife's favor
ite because of its loose curly leaves
which make it good for both sal
ads and table decoration.
If plants are set out now, you
will have all of ' tho lettuce you
need by early spring. Seed plant
ed now will furnish the plants for
aie spring arm eariy summer, ( ,
But C, K, MeQuarrie, state a-
gent for the University of Florida
extension, Division, says that let
tuce is not the only vegetable that
may be planted during December.
Cabbage may be set from plants
or the seed planted. Onions and
radishes may also be planted.
And then there is one article
which he thinks is often neglect
ed; the English pea.. These should
be sown npw for early spring. Mr.
McQuarrie recommends the Mc
Neil pea, a hardy variety originat
ed and grown successfully by a
Florida man. It is especially a-
dapted to the northern part of the
state where it was originated, for
the McNeil pea will stand the cold
with less injury than any other
variety. ' , ' "
Preparing the ground for a veg-
table garden is not an expensive
matter. It should be fertilized
with well rotted stable manure,
working it into the" soiL before
anything is planted. A light top
dressing of nitrate of soda or some
high grade commercial fertilizer
will be needed after the plants
are up. - Then the faithful use of
the hoe to keep the surface provid
ed with the necessary dust mulch
is about all that is to be done to
make your garden products avail
able for early spring use.

bonds for street paving, and they
