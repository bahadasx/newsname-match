' Mrs. J. P. Bradshaw, Prospect

have used Doan's Kidney Pills
and have found them to be a fine

Who Dttcbed tbi Htighis Machine?
Who ran the Hughes machine
into the ditch? The Progressives
blame the Old Guard chauffeur,
and the Old Guard driver puts it
up partly to the Progressive
small boys who scattered bioken
glass on the road, and partly to
L. 1 - !-,.-J
interfering with the chauffeur,
Who is responsible for the fa
mous California hand shake that
did not come on? Who is guilty
of the Golden Special, the Roose
velt war speeches, the loss of O-
liio when Wisconsin and Indiana
were saved: onouid tne soup
kitchens have been opened upear-
ier in the campaign, or should
they have remained closed? On
both sides it is taken for granted
that the Republicans had the
election won, and that had man
agement threw it away, In nei
ther camp is there any seeming
inclination to admit that per
haps there was something more
undamental involved than an
unskillful chauffeur or a nervous
passenger, or a bad boy in t h e
middle of the road. When Repub-
icans speak of States that were
ost while others were saved, they
might ponder the fact that Wil
son gained more heavily in ''sav
ed" Massachusetts than in "lost"
Kansas; more in Michigan than
in Washington; more in Aiaine
than in New Mexico. Instead of
asking themselves how they man
aged to lose Kansas, Washing
ton and New Mexico tbey might
be asking how they succeeded in
saving Massachusetts, Michigan
und Maine. So far the evidence
is that the Repulican machine
was not ditched at all, but that
'ran out of gas. New Yoik

Now Lookout.
When a cold hangs on as olteu
happpens, or when yon have
hardly gotten ovor one cold be
fore you contract another, look
out for you are liable to contract
another, look out for you are li-
aba to contract Borne very seri
ous disease. This succession of
cold6 weakens the system and
lowers the vitality so that you
aie much more liable to contract
chronic catarrh, pneumonia or
consumption. Cure your cold
wnile vou can. Chamberlain s
Cough Remedy has a great repu
tation, it is relied npon by thou
sands of people and never disap
points tbem. Try it. It only
costs a quarter. Obtainable every
where.
Smoking, says a physician, ru
ins the lining of the throat. It is
a matter of record also tbat it
has an injurious effect upon the
delicate tissues of tne purse.

f
THE FIRST STEP
Usually the first indication of t
lowering of health is found in the
bowels and liver. Something goes
wrong we eat too much, or work
too hard and the bowel action
weakens or the liver is sluggish.
That heavy feeling on arising in
the morning, dryness of the
throat, with bad taste, a slight
headache, dull eyes all show that
food has fermented in the intes
tines, and that the body is man
ufacturing poisons instead of
good blood.
Clear it all out Give the
stomach and bowels a fresh start
Encourage the liver to go to
work. Manalin does all of this,
without griping or weakening.
It's the ideal laxative and liver
tonic, because it follows Nature's
plan, without discomfort, inflam
mation or forming a habit. Con
stipation may be overcome with
its use.

A Former Cltizst Visiting la Watauga and
- Caldwell.
Mr. Amos Uenly, who.thirtren
years ago left the Globe section
of Caldwell County, and. with his
family, turned his face tu the
setting of the sun, is in for a vis
it to his aged mothc and other
relatives in Watauga county. He
was in to see us on Tuesday and
from his conversation we glean
ed that he and his family of six
sturdy boys have been succeeding
handsomely in the State of Wash
ington. They own a good farm,
all pull together, and this year
from 1,000 acres harvested 28,
000 bushels of wheat, and aside
from that had a considerable a
creage in wheat that was cut for
feeding purposes. To prove that
Mr. Henley is now on "Easy
Street," he has turned the farm
over to the boys, bought prop
erty in the town of Hay, and,
with his wife, has now settled
down to enjoy tho fruits of his
labors.
