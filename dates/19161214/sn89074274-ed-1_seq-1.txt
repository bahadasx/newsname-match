Departing Members
Honored by Faculty
The personnel of the faculty of the
State Normal school here will be af
«cted by the resignation of Mrs. Kath
rine B. Macdonald at the close of the
present term. Mrs. Macdonald leaves
her present position to join Mr. Mac
donald as he enters upon the duties of
state superintendent of public instruc
tion with the beginning of the new
year. They will then, of course, make
their home at Bismarck.
News of Mrs, Macdonald's depart
ure from school duties and from the
•community is received with consider
able regret, inasmuch as a valuable
co-wbrker will be missed. Mrs. Mac
donald has been identified with the
Normal school for the past seven
years, as instructor in the rural de
partment. During the past term she
has also served as acting head of
that department. As such she has
brought'to her work an excellent train
ing and a ripe experience as an edu
cator, all enhanced by a fine spirit of
loyalty and co-operation.
Mrs. Macdonald will be missed by
her co-workers and not the least by
her students to whom she has always
given her best self. All join in wish
ing her the best in life in her new
field of endeavor, and in this wish the
community in general also joins. Mrs.
Macdonald was allied with the musical
and social interests of the community
and her influence in these fields ,will
also be missed.
Following the regular faculty meet
ing last evening a short social ses
sion was held in the home economics
rooms in honor of Mrs. Macdonald and
Miss Candis Nelson, announcement of
whose resignation was made some
•days ago.
A light luncheon was served, after
which Prof. Knute Froysaa opened a
short program with a fine violin solo.
Miss Josephine Wright presided at the
piano during the evening. Miss Mar
tha E. Dewey responded with an ap
propriate Riley selection. D6an Wood
"hams, with Mrs. Woodhams at the pi
ano, gave a delightful baritone solo.
ProfL. B. McMpllen spoke in be
lialf of the school on the departure of
Mrs. Macdonald and Prof. Floyd T.
Goodier on the leaving of Miss Nelson.
Fitting responses were made by Mrs.
Macdonald and Miss Nelson, after
which each was presented with a beau
tiful basket of flowers, the gift of the
faculty members.
The hour was closed with the sing
ing of "Auld Lang Syne."
Club Ladies Study
Origin of the Family
Mrs. Henry Nelson was hostess Mon
day afternoon to the Neighborly Study
Club for the regular meeting and a
most enjoyable and profitable session
was held. Mr. Tuttle conducted the
lesson in sociology in a very interest
ing manner, showing thorough prepar
ation and a keen analysis of the sub
ject. The topic under discussion was
"The Origin and Development of the
Family," and this was taken up from
both biological and sociological stand
points, proving wonderfully interest
ing. The subject was so full of general
interest that it was necessary ot cur
tail the discussion for lack of time but
it will be resumed later. In the home
economics part of the program Mrs.
Luessen read a paper on "Interior Dec
orating of the Home." This topic was
given a brief historical outline and
then entered at once into the practical
discussion of modern inside finishing^
and furnishings and was well handled.
A short business meeting concluding
the session.
The next meeting will be held Jan.
8, at which time the club will have as
its guest Mr. Arnsdorf, of the Normal
school, who will give an address on
"The Family," while the general dis
cussion will follow the same line of
thought.

to be in Luverne, called up the post
office at this place and requested that
his mail be forwarded to him. When
told that he was supposed to be dead
he claimed to be a pretty lively corpse.
