The Maaon County Woman's Club
haa been successful in renting the olfl
Library building on Sutton street for
the purpose of mailing this building
their headquarters. They have MM
considering this building for several
montha but they had done nothing
definite toward this step until recent
ly. The building haa been occupied
by Mcllvatn, Knox ft Diener as
a furniture storehouse. Previous to
this the Maysvllle Public Library was
In possession of the building. It Is
located almost In the center of the city
and will be an excellent place for the
Club's headquarters.
At the time of the 8tate Federation
of Woman's Clubs, which met In this
city last spring, the need of such n
building was felt. At the time nothing
was said concerning the move hut in
the early part of the summer the ladles
composing the organisation began to
look for a suitable location. They
were given the refusal of tlie nnrary
building and after much disctiesif.n it
was accepted.
The building is now in the hands of
cleaners and workmen who are thor
ougly going over the Interior of the
building and redecorating it. The
ladles hope to soon be able to move to
to their new quarters.
A very important meeting of the
Woman's Club will be held on tomor
row afternoon at 2:30 o'clock In the
present library building. At this time
plans for the furnishing and use of the
new home will be discussed anil also
plans will be laid for a formal opening
which the club expects to bold ae soon
as possible. The ladles now feel that
they have secured a beautili.l and well
equipped place for private entertainments.

On the evening of December 26. an
opportunity will be afforded the Mi.' -
ville public to hear three distinguish
ed young artists.
Miss Mary Dan and Mr. Robert
Hatbeaon of New York, formerly of
Flemlngsburg, will give a concert on
that date in the High School audito
rium. They have such a host of
friends and admirers In this section
and in the past have given us two
such charming concerts, they need no
introduction. They will be accom
panied by Miss Florence liarbour of
this city, a pianist of brilliancy and
distinction whom we have not had the
ood fortune to hear since her un
usually gratifying metropolitan suc
cess. These three musicians snouin
be accorded a royal welcome, as they
belong to us and we are proud of
them. Since these young women an
of acknowledged loveliness there will
be a feast for the eye as well as th?
ear.
The concert is being managed by the
First District Parent-Teacher Associa
tion who will ajnploy the fund thus
acquired in keeping the wolf out of
and the children in the school this
hard winter.
