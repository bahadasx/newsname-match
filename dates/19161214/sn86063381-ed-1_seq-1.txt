SHALL BEMIDJI BE
ON THE MAP AT
WINTER CARNIVAL
JNST.PAULJAN.27?
That's Question to Be Decided at
Meeting Tonight Everybody
is Welcome.
MEETING AT COMMERCIAL
CLUB QUARTERS, 9 O'CLOCK
Expressions are Welcome From All
Other Cities Will Be Repre
sented During Week.
Is Bemidji to be on the map at the
great winter carnival of sports to be
held in St Paul the week of January
27 That is the question to be dis
cussed in the Commercial club rooms
this evening at 9 o'clock aud it is*
urged that every Bemidji booster be
present. The meeting is not a Com
mercial club aftair and not confined
to Commercial club members, but is
for every one who is a booster or
who may have an idea on the sub^
ject to De discussed.
W Branfield, representing the
carnival association, was in Bemidji
last night and met several citizens*
in the interests of the carnival and
also to enlist the presence of Bemidji
in being properly represented, as
will several of the cities throughout
the state ,in the big parade to be
staged as a feature of the affair.
The proposition is simply this:
Every one who attends* Will provide
a suitable costume for the parade,
and also pay his traveling and hotel
expense, which is not great. All
other entertainment is gratis. Word
comes from other cities, even smaller
than Bemidji, that they will be
largely represented by delegations
and it is up to Bemidji to say what
it will do in the line of boosting
and letting others know that Be
midji is the livesit wire in the state
in the way of a municipality.
The carnival is one of the great
events of the northwest and it is es
timated that this year fully 150,000
persons will be there during the
week All St. Paul will turn out
in the welcome of the visitors and
do everything in their power to make
their stay one of unusual interest.
Be at the meeting tonight and say
what you think about it. Everybody
welcome and expressions of opinion
are what are wanted.

GOVERNORS TACKLE
STATE PROBLEMS
(By United Press)
Washington, Dec 14Forty gov
^uors, aided by several governors
elect and by as many more former
chief executives, rollde up their
seleves today at the opening of the
annual conference of governors, to
take up some of the heaviest prob
lems the conference has ever wres
tled with. They will be in session
three days.
It is believed that a storm of dis
cussion will center around the ques
tion of increasing the powers of the
Interstate Commerce commission to
fix intrastate railway rates. From
opinion gathered before assembly
most of the governors will opposte
isany curtailment of state control over
vstate rates.
Western governors are expected to
lead in attack against Federal su
pervision or control of lands and nat
ural resources within state borders.
L^Ohief of the social events is a re
ception by President and Mrs. Wil-
&6n at the White House tomorrow.

INDIAN LANDS TO
BE DRAINED, IS
ASSERTION MADE
ALONG RED LAKE
Would Be of Great Value to Those
living: Along- Western Border
of Reservation.
WORK STARTED IN SPRING
PREVENT FUTURE FLOODS
Cost of Project Will Fall Entirely
Upon Indians Entirely Inside
Their Reservation.
Thief River Falls, Minn., Dec. 14.
Drainage of lands along the Red
Lake river by the officials of the Rei
Lake Indian reservation has been as
sured land owners, according to in
formation received by Senator D. P.
O'Neill of this city. This drainage
will be of inestimable value to a
large number of people in the far
eastern part of Pennington county
and those living on the western bor
der of the reservation.
The two-mile strip through Stein
er, Star and Hickory townships, lying
next to the reservation, has been
inundated practically all the time
this past season and the residents
have been after the county officials
for some time to put in a ditch along
the dividing line between the county
and the reservation. The county
board recently agreed to do this if
the reservation authorities would
stand for half of the cost, but this
is impossible as there can be no as
sessment of Indian lands.
However, when the matter was
brought to the attention of Indian
Agent Dickens he took the matter up
with the federal authorities and se
cured their approval of a ditch one
mile within the reservation running
north and south. This* will no doubt
be undertaken in the spring and
there should not be a recurrence of
the flooded conditions that prevailed
all this season.
The cost of the ditch will fall en
tirely upon the Indians as it will be
entirely within their reservation, but
the lands in Pennington county will
receive just as much benefit. These
lands in this county have already
been taxed for ditches farther to the
westt and so it will be a mighty big
boost to these property owners.
CASS OFFICIALS QUIT
HIGH EXPENSE CAUSE
Walker, Minn., Dec. 14.Commis-
sioners Moulster and Swanberg of
Cass county have resigned, claiming
expenste of the recent investigation
was more than they could stand.

SMITH MEETS SMITH
SMITH GOES TO JAIL
When Officer Ike Smith of Nymore
ward met Frank Smith late last
night it was a case of Frank having
a personally conducted tour to the
city jail, for he had met a couple
of friends on their return from Min
neapolis, so he said, and the result
was that Frank did the human
sponge act and became saturated
with a portion of the contents of
a couple quart bottles* of extract of
corn.
To be perfectly clear, Smith was
"soused" properly when the officer
got a line on him. To Police Judge
Crowell the prisoner told all about
it. He had $2 left and the judge
went fifty-fifty with him, making the
fine $1, which was paid, after which
Smith volunteered that it was the
last time he would ever appear in
court on a similar charge.
OFFICER ESSLER PLAYS
SANTA TO WANDERER
Usually, a policeman is figured as
most anything except a human be
ing and if it wasln't for this story
no one would know of the humanity
possessed by Officer Jack Essler in
emulating the role of Santa Claus
to a destitute "hobo," who for the
past three nights has been allowed
to keep warm within the confines
of the city bastile.
Mr. Bo is homeless and a stranger
in a strange land. Likewise his
wearing apparel was hardly suffi
cient to make a greaser for a pan
cake griddle, and the below zero at
mosphere wasn't one bit particular.
Officer Essler recognized the plight
of the fellow and, seeming to be a
pretty good scout, the husky bluecoat
got busy. Result is that warm cloth
ing, cap, mittens and substantial
shoes' were purchased and he was set
to work cleaning the snow off the
municipal skating rink on the lake.
And the bill was paid' for out/ftf
the policeman's pocket.

proper to give out. This will be sup

were viewed with deep concern here.

London, Dec 14.Grave internal
dissentions during the past few
weeks, food shortage and reigns of
terror, strained relations between
Germany and Austria-Hungary and
Turkey, all of which have been con
