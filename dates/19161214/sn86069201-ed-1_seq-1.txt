LUTHER HERRON
Named As Chief Marshall, And Bock As
Superintendent 01 Water Woiks.
A good crowd was on hand last Mor
day night at the meeting of the City
Council when it became known that the
appointment of Chief of Police and tho
Superintendent of the water works
would take place at that meeting. Only
two nominations were made for the
MarehalsMp, Mr. Gregory nominating
Mr. Herron and Mr. Dalton nominating
Mr. W. S. Carrier. When the vote
was taken, Gregory, Cotton, Anion and
Goodloc voted for H-rron. while Dalton
and Zanone voted for Carrier. The
naming of Mr. Herron seems to meet
with the general approbation of the
public, fur many think he made one of
the beat marshals the town has ever
had. After the election lie was the re
cipient of many congratulations. The
names of U. Duck, Harry Anderson,
Ilruce Luwson and J, A. Uenzley, were
placed in nonffnation for the oillce of
Superintendent and Tux collector, but
upon the call of roll It was seen that
Mr. Duck had the appointment by ac
clj'nutloM, the entire council voting for
him. Friendi of Mr. Duck aay for nim
that lie hus made the) best tax collector
the town lias had In recent years and
the result is that both uppointmenta
seem to meet with popular fnvnr.
Mr. R. II. llatson protected masterly
und atrongly ugninst thu council grant
ing ii permit to Haielden Ilrothers
erecting a garage on the lot recently
purchased by them and which adjoins
the residonce of Mr. llatson on Lexing
ton street. Two petitions were filed
signed bv numerous citizens along that
street and another petition signed by
many patrons of the Graded School
claiming that It would be a detriment
and dangerous to the many children
that pass that point on their way to
and from school. No action was taken,
for It was announced by Attorney J. E.
Robinson that an application for a per
mit had never been asked for ofllcially
by Haselden Uros.

A BREAKFAST
BACON RECIPE.
A Missouri farmer who built up a
good meat business uses the following
recipe, which is especially fine for
breakfast bacon. Salt, fifteen pounds;
brown sugar, three pounds; powdered
borax, one pound; black pepper, one
pound; saltpeter, one-fourth of a pound.
Mix thoroughly, place In a large pan on
the stove and keep warm enough so
that you can just bear your hand in it.
With this mixture rub the meat on both
sids until it sweats. Apply all the
mixture that will posslblg stick, l'ark
the meat away in barrels or boxes for
ten or twelve dava; harg and smoke
with hickory wood or corncobs until a
nice straw color is obtained. This may-
hang all season without trouble trom
flies or bugs. The side meet will have
the same flavor as breakfast bacon, and
the joints the same flavor as sugar-
cured meat.
STEALS BUGGY
While Owner Is In Church.
Harvev Davis charged with takin? a
buggy from in front of the Methodist'
church last Sunday, without the owners

Ing and held over to await the action of
the grand-jury and his bond placed at
$250 The buggy proved to be Mr.

another party.

Of Shells And Draws A Fiae Of $20.
Fred Ollis pocketed a box of shot
gun shells belonging to H. D. Lee and
Son, last Friday, while Mr. Lee was in
the rear of the store, but some one
from the street saw the theft and re
ported the matter to Mr. Lee, Ollis

Adams. She too wat brouglit before

fined $50 and costs, lleing unable to
pay or replevy their fines they weie
