Saving money is the one sure way to have money. ... , . " ,
Most large fortunes began with small savings. ;
, Many small deposits make a large sum:, as . the , amount in
creases, your" interest in , your balance increases; and it is
that interest, called "the saving habit" that leads to wealth.
To give all "a bank connection" so that they will learn the
? many ways in which our bank can be-.of service to them.
