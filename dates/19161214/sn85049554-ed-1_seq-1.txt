There is a feeling here that the pres

J.nd
is looking forward to a movement
or a league of nations to pteserve
peace as one of the elements of the set

It is possible mat some means will
be taken to establish moire definitely
the temper of the allies toward the
proposals before the president acts, but
there will be no delay ^ln* forwarding
the note to the belligerent- capitals.

After reading the German mte care
fully, Secretary Lansiiig sard: that*
while Qiere were some differences in
translation when compared with the
unofficial copy, ~&nd wf&ie the order of
arrangement of some of the paragraphs
was somewhat different, there was no
change in meaning.
Mr. I^ansing said the note would go
forward to the belligerents, presumably
today, and said it was not decided
whether an expression of the presi
dent would accompany it.
The German note was the only one
to arrive. Nothing has been heard of
the notes from Austria, Bulgaria and
Turkey.
At least one of the ambassadors of
the European neutrals he^e already
has sent a dispatch to his home gov

assure President Wilson of the sup

The first nation to adopt the eagle ad
a symbol of royal pq^er was the
Eitruscans of ancient Italy, who bore
the Image of an eagle at the head of
their armies at -Cunaxa in 401 B. 2.
The eagle became the standard of
the Roman legions in the time of
Marlus. The Roman eagle was repre
sented with outspread wings. The
Byzantine emperors had as their em
blem a double-headed eagle, signifi
cant of their claim to empire in -both
east and west. The eagle "was later
adopted by the German emperors and
the rulers of Prussia, Poland and
Fussia. Charlemagne added the second
bead to the eagle for his-.arma to sig
nify that the empires of Rome and
Germany-were united under him. The
eagle was the standard of Napoleon
aft-d tras r?«fored to Prance during the
second empire.
The design for the great seal of the
United States, embracing a spread
eagle, was suggested to Jfthn Adams,
then minister to Great Britain, by Sir
John Prestwlch, an eminent English
antiquary, and was adopted by con
KMu in 1782.

German Victory—-Asks Authority to
Adopt Requisition Provided Step Is
Necessary—Japan Refuses to Take
Peace Proposals Seriously.
Paris, Dec. 14.—Premier priand ac:
Companied his denunciation of the
German peace offer as a trap with an
announcement that he would ask for
Increased'power with which to carry
on the war, according to full reports of
his speech before the chamber of dep
uties today. At the same'time the pre
mier promised that the government
would not undertake any scheme of
general mobilization such as that in
volved in the German army plan.
"Evidently," said the premier, "re
cent developments are serious, but it is
unnecessary to recall what has happen
ed in 1916. After eight months it is not rt
German but a French victory which in
truth has .been inscribed %n French
flags."
Derides German Claims.
The premier referred to the French
success at Verdun and the gains on the
Somme and derided Germany for its
claim of victory while it was taking
such measures as what he terms the
militarizing of the entire nation.
He asked all power in carrying for
ward the national defense, including
requisition, but said If the latter step
was necessary it would not be carried
out inconsiderately.
The chamber applauded when fie an
nounced that the government would
ask for the suppression of tle liquor
raffic thruout France.
The premier expressed |the Certainty
that some of the measures taken by
Germany have behind them the lobjedt
of intensifying thfe war next spring
when she will have stronger armies to
fa*:e. He warned France to be pre
pared for these efforts and to have
confidence inthe final outcome.
Warns Against Peace Offer.
Premier Briand during last night's
sessioirof the chamber of deputies de
livered a -speech .on the German impe
rial Chancellor's peace .proposal' Iti
which he wanied- the country to be
ware of France's enemies. 'He added
•that France would not do lefcs in the
•premises than -the (fther members of
the allied conference. The chamber
passed a vote of confidence in the new
government, 314 lo 165.
"I have-the duty1 to place my country
on guard against" possible poisoning."
said M. Briand amid'applause. "When
a country arms Itself "to the teeth, when
it seizes men everywhere in violation
of the law8/ of nations and enforces la
bor upon them, I should be guilty If 1
did not _cijy out to my country, 'L#ook
out "take care.'
"Blood on Their Hands."
"I have the right, in the first place,
to say to our eneuilea for the hun
dredth time, 'The blood Is on1 your
hands, not upon ours.' Not that I
doubt the clear-sightedness of my
(iountry, but in' the face of these at
tempts to spread dissension among the
allies 'I exWaim, The French republic
will not do less than the convention.'"
The chamber-held a large number of
deputies who desired to witness the
first, appearance of the new cabinet.
•M. Briand, instead of reading the
declaration of the program of the re
organized ministry, out-lined it ex
temporaneously.. The premier said
that in secret sessions most delicate
questions had been considered.
Th$ socialists interrupted the speak
er with cries of "No," but Paul Des
chanel, president of the fhamber, soon
succeeded In restoring order.
M. Briand then continued:
Certain of Victory.
"The government Is ready for all
discussions and all explanations."
He referred to the adoption by the
chamber of a' resolution demanding a
reorganization- in the conduct of the
war, the constitution of a war com
mittee and modifications In the high
command. He said the war com
mittee would sit permanently and that
it would increase the production of
war necessltlefa.
"NO'one can say that I have ever
been unduly optimistic," said .M.
Briand. "But today, however, more
than ever, we must have the convic
tion that victory Is certain. Nowhere
have the German successes been de
cisive.
"It is true that valorous Roumania
has lissii forced tn nrwl If a
sad event but its army, supported by
that of Russia, will come into its own.
As to the question in the east, it Is
far from being settled, and tomorrow
there will be a n«w front which will
neutralize the enemies' forces,"

ndon, Dec. 14.—In tfcovlng a vote ij
of credit of 400,000,000 pounds In the
house of commons today, A. Bpnar
Law, chancellor of the exchequer, de
cided to confine his speech to the
financial side of the war and, .in the
absence of Premier Lloyd-George and
former Premier Asqulth. owing to 111
"ess, It was expected the debate would
be merely along this line. However*
this will not prevent members of th«
small group of peace advocates from
asking questions In an effort to draw
out the government in regard to Ger
many's peace proposal, altho it was
regarded as unlikely that they would
succeed.
The proposal of the central powers
had not been received at the foreign
office this morning and as It was
understood to concern only the opening
of negotiations the consultations of the
entente allies regarding it are ex
pected to be purely informal, prelimi
nary to the transmission of a Joint re- ii
ply. In any event Great Britain wlir
make no official comment until Russia.'
France and her allies express their
view.
Fourteenth Since War Began.
Today'^ vote nf credit Is Che four-,
teenth since the outbreak of. the war,
bringing up the total for the present
financial year to' 1,750,000,000 pounds
and the grand total for the war to
3,5?.',000,000 pounds (117.660.000,000).
While there is always a large at
tendance of members on the day a
rote of credit is moved, even more '."j
than usual interest was shown in to
day's proceeding^ owing to curiosity
as to whether any change would ba
announced In the manner of financing
the war and as to the reception by
liberals of the nesw chancellor's polioy.
