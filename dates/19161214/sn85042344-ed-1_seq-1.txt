WASHINGTON', I iee. 13. A note
of explanation from Germany today

concerning the sinking of the. steamer

was sailing under the llritlsh flag and
was sunk by a submarine alter pi'"-tv

cause she was capuneo himjii,,
contraband and could not be taken
into port.
The niilv oncstinn at Isno In tho
rase was whether the vessel was
under American registry, In which
case Germany would be liable tor
damages to her owners. It is admitted
that she was sold by her owners in
Minila before slartine on her last
voyage, but her master has reported
that- the ueliial transfer of registiy
had not taken place. This point will
be investigated further.

The German note dated Merlin
Iiecember and signed by Foreign j
Secretary Zimmerman follows: I
"on October is, last, a German
submarine encountciod the steamer
Lanao on the way to Lo Havre and
ruptured It as a prize because It was
carrying contraband to the enemy.
! Since the subujarinu was uuutile lo
conduct the Limao into u i.eiinan or
allied port without exposing itself
to the danger of sinking, it sunk tun
Hoamer after It had taken the cre.v
on board. Tho crew was then sent on
board the Norwegian steamer Tromp
which was Just at the tune 111 sight.
Itoat sold in July.
Tho steamer Lanao belonged ori
ginally to the Finilley, .Millar Mount-
hip company of .Manila, it was, how
ever, sold in July, isni. to uie snip
ping firm of HaiiiieV.g brothers or
London and sailed since under tlie

of llannevig brothers are the sons or
the ship owners Christian Hatiucvig

Actual consl ruct l..n work on the
interurban system that will connect
Tulsa and Sapiilpu will be started
Thursday morning when fifty teams
and more than ir.0 men will begin
grading the road bed from West Tulsa
to Led Fork. Thus will bo started
Ihe first unit of a vast Inlcruibuu
system (hat will be built out of Tulsa,
the arms of which will stretch in
many illi ci t Ions, according to an
liouticoiueni uiiide yesterday by 1. F.
Crow, active iiiauagor ami construc
tion superintendent of the system
which is being built by the Tulsa
Traction company.
Allho then- have been numerous
plans announced in recent years pro
posing tlm building of an intcrtirhuu
system from Tulsa to Sspulpa and
from Tulsa to other points in the sur
rounding lerriloiy none of them have
ever pi led further than tho paper
stage anil It Is with n degree of slatis
f. nil, in that local capitalists have
stalled actual work on a system that
will he completed without a bond is
sue lo secure funds to further tho
work.
This Work lo lie Ituslicd.
Heroic the end of this month tho
roadbed from West Tulsa to Ited Fork
will be completed, t was stated
Wednesday, and within three or pos
sibly four days a large corps of men
ami many teams will begin grading
the right-of-way from First street
III Tulsa to the river bridge.
All posihle haste Is to be exe vised
III the construction of the road and by
the time the budge spanning the Ar
kansas river Is completed nnd the
stool laid across It, It will be possible
to operate trains from Tulsu to West
Tulsa.
.Material Pun based.
That extensive preparations have
been muilo and that there will be no
delay occasioiiod dy material shortage
Is shown by the fact that practically
all of the material needed In com
pleting the railroad from Tulsa to a
point half way to Sapulpa bus been
purchased and that sufficient ties,
poles, steel and copper trolley Wire
for the construction of six miles of
line Is now In transit. Mr. Crow said.
I hiring Christinas week ten cars of
similar material will be started for
Tulsa.
Contracts that have been let call for
a completed road not later than Jan
uary .'II that will p. omit the operation
of trains from Tulsa to Hod Fork.
Fxhaiistlve plans have ben ennsuin
iiialed and railroad traffic innnagTs
have I n conferring wit the local
oaintnlisls relative to expediting the
delivery of this material and the dis
tribution at convenient points.

When seen Wednesday afleinoon
Mr. Crow- stateel that the promoters
have the Interest of Tulsa in mind and
that such a system of luterurhans ns
contempluted Is all absolute necessity

"Tulsa." he said, "Is u skyscraper
city. The mention of a contemplated
tcn-storv building causes ro excited
comment and even tho announcement
i f ground-breaking ror such gigantic
bulb lings elnits no expressions of sur

"With the population ero'vlng
nea'er every day and the construe
lion of mammoth business blocks,
apartment houses and residences con
tinning unabated, tho need tor sin h a
system as we are goliii! to build is be

he said.
A Modern Itoail.
"This TuN.i to Sipnlpa lino," Mr.
Crowe con. iniieil. "will be built along
