Money For Public
Improvements.
In this issue a special from Thief
River Falls to the Minneapolis
Journal is published which shows
that another effort is going to be
made to induce Congress to ap
propriate tribal funds to drain
some more of the public lands up
on the ceded Red Lake reservation
by draining Red Lake and R^d
Lake River.
It is very evident that the county
officials who are taking an active
part in the proposition to drain
Red Lake are not going to do so
for the benefit of the Red Like In
dians who have lived on the shores
of Red Lake for at least two hund
red years without being inconven
ienced by the waters of Red Lake,
but will do so merely for the bene
fit of the white settlers upon the
ceded reservation, and no thought
whatever is bei-g given to the in
terests of the Indians.
It is of course not known by the
Indians of this and the o'her Chip
pewa reservations in this sUte,
who own the tribal funds of the
Chippewas of Minnesota now in
the Treasury of the United States,
how the Red Lake ChiDpewas re
gard the proposed drainage of
Red Lake, but those who are fa
"miliar with Chippewa sentiment
generally know that the latter are
strongly opposed to the appropria
tion of tribal funds for public pur
poses such as are suggested in the
special referred to. If Congress
wishes to appropria'e funds for
the purpose indicated, it should
appropriate public funds and not.
Chippewa tribal funds.
Whether the Red Lake Indians
will oppose the drainage of Red
Lake, or allow any interference
with the lake is not known here,
but if they should oppose drainage
and parry the matter into the
United States courts, there is no
question but that the courts would
sustain them unless Congress
hould pass some law granting the
Minnesota officials the right to put
through their scheme. If Con
gross should follow well establish
ed precedents it would deem *ft
necessary to first obtain the assent
of the Red Like Indians before
allowing any drainage to be com
menced.

Plans for the straightening and

from the outlet of the lakes to
Thief River Falls were presented
by O. L. Dent of Bemidji, judicial
referee in ditch matters for th"
counties of Pennington, Red Lake,
Clearwater and Beltrami, and
emby
bodying also the construction of a
retaining dam at the outlet of the
hike, the cost of which was esli
mated to be about $300,000. It is
proposed to divide the cost into
four Dirtsthe power interests,
the river and harbor interests, the
state of Minnesota and the land of
the white man and the Indian
each of the latter bearing an
eighth.
J. J. Opsahl of Bemidji called
attention to the fact that the fed
eral government had spent millions
maintaining 225 miles of navi
irable shore line on the upper Mis
sissippi, while not one per cent
hid been expended ou the Red
lakes, where the development was
equally important. He believed
that the government if approached
in the right manner would under
tike the work as outlined by Mr.
Dent.
Daniel Shaw of this city stated
that the Indians of the Red Lake
reservation had already asked the
government to drain their 300,000
acres of land at their expense, un
der the provisions or the Nelson
act. If this drainage were put
into effect, he said, it wou'd make
their lands worth from $3,000,000
to $4,000,000.Mpis. Journal.

Truth
ackfeet Indians' Fair is
Interesting to White
Just how much the Indian has
learned to do for himself in the
master of entertainment and edu
it ion is disclosed in an interest
ing way bv the annual Black feet
Indian fair, held at Browning,
Mont., in the reservation of that
tribe. Mrs L. R. Howell, Sr
who recently returned from the
West, where she made an extended
tour during several months, visit
ing Glacier National park and the
Indian fair in September.
Mrs. Howell writes:
"The exhibition hall and stock
corrals contained a splendid dts
pl i.y of farm and ranch products
and the school exhibits ot the In
dian pupils and displays fancy
work and culinary departments
showed to what extent the Black
feet have advanced in the arts of
civilization, the results of which
would be a credit to any class of
people.
"The tepees of the Blackfeet
were pitched in a great circle,
surrounding the fair ground1-:.
As
night fell the tents were lighted
up by the camp fires and from the
city of tepees came the sound of
the drumming torn torn and the
weird chants of the dancers.
"Public dances were also held
by the Indians on the parade
grounds each morning, between.
the camp and the fair grounds,
which were enjoyed as much by
the whites who witnessed them as
by the reds who participated in
them.
"The costumes worn were
gorgeous beyond description, be
ing designed and made by the na
tive squaws
"The fair grounds contained the
usual stands and popcorn venders,
and all such concessions were
handled and run exclusively by In
dians, with the exception of a
merry-go-round and some side
novelties-, which were furnished
a, carnival company.
"A band of 16 pieces, the mem
bers of which were all mixed
blood and full blood Indians, rend
ered excellent and up-to date music
from a pavilion opposite the grand
stand, while the events of the most
interesting program were being
carried on.
"It was also a sight most un
usual to see the grandstand filled
to overflowing with the native^
dressed in the gorgeous colors of
their liking, their black hair, in
perfect braid*, where they had
paid the extra price of admission
for the benefit of obtaining a more
advantageous and more comfort
able position to view the games
and contests.
"It was the 'real' 'wild west,'
not the circus kind, with profes
sional riders, ropers and bronco
busters, who travel from city to
city and make a busmess of their
skill, but it was all 'home product.'
Ail of the participants were resi-'
dents of the reservation and no
whites were allowed to participate
in any of the contests nor compete
for any of the prizes.
"There were bucking horses,
riding the bucking steers, bull
digging a steer and some modern
harness races, but the most inter
esting of all the events was the
wild horse race, in which absolute
ly untamed horses from the range
were used.

LES ROYS.
(By Rev. C. H. BeauUeu.)
(Concluded from last issue.)
There he engaged in the hotel
business, one maintained, I believe
until his death.
While at Crow Wing he became
interested in politics. As a demo
crat he was elected to the House
of Representatives of the Terri
tory of Minnesota.
1 will not venture to be accurate
but I will state in a general way
that Benton County extended from
Sauk Rapids northward to the
boundarv line between this country
and the Hudson Bay Territory. 1
suppose but for the old royal
grant to the Hudson Bay Co.,
Uncle Sail when he had wiggled
out of the clutches of England,
would have claimed jurisdiction
indefinitely towards the frozen
waters of the north, perhaps to
the Pole and a little way around
on the other side. Assuming this
what a vast territory Mr. Roy
would have represented at the
Capital St. Paul.
H:s constituents would not have
been many as regards voters, but
counting "Indians not taxed," and
those of animal, bird and fish life,
Mr. Roy did represent many and
much.
It may be stated here that dur
ing Mr. Roy's political career his
constituants knew but one party,
they had heard vaguely of an op
position party so of course M
Rby's victory can harcl.v be called
so, he was nominated for the
House and received every vote,

which is'nt saying mu
the voters did not constitute
army.
But he represented the district
well and acceptably, so his de
scendants have reason to cherish
his political career and esteem it.
fondly.
In our day we are disposed to
hold early legislation in but little
esteem, but the pioneers did well
and lii foundations firmly for the
achievements of the community
afterwards becoming the State.
True there uere "Ways that
were dark and tricks that were
vain," such for instance as the
trick of JoeRollette when he stole
che Capital Bill. But Joe and his
friends were only fighting a nght
ious cause, and posterity should
be glad that the Capital is St. Paul
and not St Peter.
Mr. Roy helped make Territor
ial and State history and wo whomanaged
knew him personally, and those
who know him by report may re
joice that a Chippewa wa^ promin
ently identified with the history of
the Territory and thus in a meas
ure with the State of Minnesota.
In his family relations Mr. Rov
was all that could have been de
sired.
Outside and socically he was es
teemed and regarded as a true
friend.
Speaking personally from along
and intimate acquaintanceship with
him, I can say that I never heard
of his doing anything to injure
anyone, he was always the com
panionable man, his laugh was
pleasant to hear, and it was con
tagious, for it was hearty and gen
ine and sufficiently loud.
