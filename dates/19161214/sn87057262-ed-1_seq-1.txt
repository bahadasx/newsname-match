FIRST HAND STORIES
One City of 40,000 People Has Been
Cut to 15,000 by Rav­
ages of Dread
Hunger.
[By Webb Miller, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 14,—Af
fidavits by an American mining man,
describing terrible economic condi
tions now prevailing in central Mex
ico as a result of continuous revolu
tions, were forwarded to Washing
ton today by United States depart
ment agents here.
The mining man's statement is one
of the few first hand stories of the
Mexican interior conditions to reach
the federal authorities from authen
tic sources.
"From a beautiful city of 40,000
persons," the statement reads, "Gun
ajuoto, the capital of that state, has
been reduced to about fifteen thous
and by the ravages of disease and
starvation. In the laat four months
the death rate from starvation and
disease has been more than seventy
•per day. 1 have seen women begging
in the streets, die from lack of food.
"I counted ten dead in an hour
carried past my residence on sheet
iron stretchers. I saw one man
executed for stealing a blanket and
four prominent merchants shot for re
fusing to accept fiat currency.
'^Sanitary conditions in Guanajuato
are beydnd description. Peons un
able to obtain clothes, wear grass and
corn sheaves tied about their bodies
with cords.
"Sisters ir» the convent there were
taken by government soldiers to a
fate worso than death. The wonder
ful church of Guadalupe was sacked
and converted into a bull ring and
dance hall by the troops."
In a sworn statement, the mining
man charged that the government
troops had appropriated twenty-five
carloads of corn sent by the Red
Cross to famine sufferers. He said
that the governor of Guanajuato con
trolled the food supply and sold corn
at three dollars and a half per
bushel.
The United States authorities would
not reveal the name of the mining
man who made the affidavit, stating
that he intended to return to Mexico
later and the use of his name might
result in complication with the Mexi
can government.
Santa Rosalia Captured Again.
EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 14.—Villista
forces have again captured the town
of Santa Rosalia south of Chihuahua
City from Mexican government troops,
according to a report reaching United
Stales authorities here today. Only
meager details of the capture have
reached tne border early today. The
town was garrisoned by about three
hundred Carranzistas.
Almost continuous skirmishing is in
progress between government forces
and the bandits along the Mexican
Central railway line near Oritz, thirty
miles south of Chihuahua City, where
the line has been cut. A detachment
of General Murgia's troops engaged a
small cavalry party of Villistas near
Oritz, defeating them, according to an
announcement made at the Mexican
consulate here.
