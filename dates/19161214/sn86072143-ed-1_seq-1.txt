W. Cobb, assistant general salesmanagcr
of tho American Can company, of Now

New York Stale Cnnners' association.
The cost of seed, crop failures, scarcity,
Inelllclency nnd high cost of labor, and
high prices of steel for cans were men
tioned as some reasons. Others were
Slate and federal laws restricting the
hours of workers in canneries.
"There will be considerable eminent
