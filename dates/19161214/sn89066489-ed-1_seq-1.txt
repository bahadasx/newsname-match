NUMBER 9
EMBARGO MAY BE PLACED
ON FOODSTUFF
President May Use Embargo to
Solve High Cost of Living
Problem.
Washington, D. C. Dec. 7
That every resource at the com
mand of the White House, includ
ing, possibly, an embargo upon
the shipment of food stuffs and
clothing material to Europe,
will be used in broading the scope
of the federal probe into the
high cost of living became evi
dent today when the president
called before him his most loyal
supporters in both the lower and
upper houses of Congress.
He asks that the congression
al legislation program be speed
ed up as fast as possible so that
the congress might have ample
time at this session to consider
certain recommendations that
might be made contemplating a
remedy for the abnormal increase
in retail food and' clothing prices.
Although branches of the ad-
' ministrative government,, includ
ing the department of justice
and the federal trade commission
' have been conducting more or
less independent investigations
into certain conditions properly
doming under their .jurisdiction,
various grain and produce ex
changes in the east will be sub
jected to searching inquiry by
agents of the department of jus
lice.
Prosecutions, it is declared,
will quickly follow the gathering
of any evidence that indicates an
attempt to take an unjustified
advantage of conditions based
unon a mythical influence of
"the war."
As a drastic resort, it is said
by tlmse who know the White
House sentiments, will be an cm
l)a rgo upon the shipment of
gram, cold storage meats and pro
duce, leather and other products.
Girard-Campbell.
Oi-r Campbell, of Elvaston, 111.,
and Miss Mary P. Oirard, daugh
ter of Mr. ami Mrs. M. C. Girard,
of near this city, were united in
marriage December 6th, 1916, at
the Ohio street M. E. church par
sonage in this city by the pastor,
Rev. C. A. Waters, in the presence
of a few of the relatives and
friends of the bride. The serious
illness of the bride's mother pre
vented the ceremony at the fam
ily home. The happy pair will
spend their honeymoon in the
east and expect to be at home to
their friends on January 1 , at
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
SCARE RESULTED FROM
ITS NEWNESS
Disease Not as Fatal as Many
Others Which Ravage Coun
try Constantly.
The usual prevalence of infan
tile paralysis in the United States
which has amounted to an epi
demic in' greater New. York, has
shown up certain charteristics of
human nature.
The total number of cases in
Greater New York has been ap
proximately 9,000, the number of
deaths approximately 2,300. Fif
ty thousand dollars was given by
a well known foundation for
work in stopping this outbreak,
and the United States govern
ment appropriated $135,000 for
the same purpose. Practically ev
ery city of any size in the Unit
ed 'States, and especially those
east of the Mississippi River, has
taken extra precaution to prevent
the spread ot this disease. ,
The cause of the disease"ailtl its
method of transmission are- un
known. It appears in unexpected
places often at considerable .dis
tances from the nearest city in
which an outbreak has occurred,
as it were, cities which are be
tween the two places. While the
to some of the other well known
ones which are with us year in
and out, the reason for this state
ment will appear.
In Greater New York upwards
of .10,000 people die of consump
tion every year, In other words,
the death rate from consumption
is greater than the total number
of cases of infantile paralysis,
and yet no excitement is caused
by this disease. In the number of
deaths -from infantile paralysis
and even in the total number of
cases it docs not compare in im
portance to the well known dis
eases, diphtheria, scarlet fever;
and typhoid fever, which we have
with us always. Yet no extraor
dinary efforts are made by any
board of health at Washington to
take charge of these diseases and
prevent their spread. Vear after
year their ravages persist. If
similar efforts woro made to stop
tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet
fever, measles-and typhoid fever
the number of cases and deaths
which they all cause would be
greatly lessened,, but it seems im
possible to excite any great
amount of interest over diseases
to. which we have become so
thoroughly accustomed. It is the
new and mysterious which always-excites
alarm and interest.

Beautiful Snow.
High Paper Causes Failure.
. .Macon, Mo.,. Dec. 0. Charles
W. Shelton of Macon has been ap
pointed receiver for the Macon
Times-Democrat, the oldest paper
in the county. The Irvin Paper
Company of (.iiiney, III., and the
Home Coal Company of Macon
are among the creditors.
C. X. Tolman, manager of the
.paper, said 1 lit assets were more
than sufficient to meet liabilities,
but that "the paper had not been
making any nioncym account of
conditions, especially that left by
a contest, as more than three thou
sand subscribers paid in advance,
and the ever increasing cost of
white paper made the fulfillment
of these contracts an expense
which Ihe receipts were inade
quate to meet."
The paper will be continued un
der )li direction of the receiver.
This part of the state was treat-
Premiums for Country Cured
Meat.
The Missouri State Hoard of
Agriculture has again set aside
il'iO to be awarded in premiums
on the best country cured hams
and bacon, country cured should
ers, fresh and smoked and fancy
country" sausage exhibited at the
Farmers Ham and Bacon Show,
it has not been, until today, deff
rutely known that the congress
itself would be projected at the
instigation of the president into
the general investigation.
Speculators in various food
stuffs, including buyers in the
grain, market, cold storage con
cerns, packers and great whole
sale houses, as well as exporters
will come within the field of con
gressional questioning. The ac
tivities of such operators as the
former Kansas City street ped
dler, James E. Wctz, who has
eornered the egg market, will be
looked into, and operators on the
the farm of th(
e groom near
vaston, 111. The well wishes of
all who know, them go. with them.
Basket Ball Teams Break Even
at Appleton City.
The two basket ball teams from
the Butler High School motored
over'to Appleton City Friday af
etrnoon and tangled with the
Appleton City teams. The But
ler boys -were defeated by a
score of 53 to 26. The girls were
more fortunate and succeeded in
defeating the Appleton City girls
15 to 10.
disease is not extremely fatal as
compared to some others, it is
very apt to leave lifelong injury
in the shape of paralysis, which
affects one or more limbs, or
groups of muscles.
It is, of course, right to take
every precaution to prevent the
spread of this disease, but there
does not seem to be any good rea
son for the great amount of ex
citement which the disease has
caused. Certainly, it has received
an unusual proportion of atten
tion. When we compare the
death rate, and even the total
number of cases, of this disease
Lost Stock.
Thomas Messier, over east, lost
a mule Friday valued at $200. The
animal stabbed itself by running
against the sharpened end of a
rail, and the same day a nice calf
of Tom's took sick and died.
A few days ago Knowl Harnett
east of town, and G. D. Wood,
just north, lost a milch cow each
by cornfodder poison.-
People should think twice be
fore deciding to turn their stock
iiifd the corn fields this year.
