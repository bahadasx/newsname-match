the President Should Do in
Transmitting Note.
MAY MAKE EXPRESSION '
Wants to Do Something That;
Will Prevent Rejection without
an Examination. \
(BY ASSOCIATED AttCSC) V
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14?The note 1
conveying the proposal for peace by 1
the Central powers, which the United 1
States Is to transmit to the Entente
belligerents, arrived during the night :
nnd was being prepared for President
Wilson early Thursday.
The actual transmittal of the peace
I proffer now brings up the important
question of whether President Wilson
"will decide to act merely as an intermediary
or whether he will accom- |
pany the transmittal with some expression
of hope in some form that
the proposals for consideration of
peace shall not be rejected without
examination and reflection. There is
a prevailing opinion here that the <
president wants to do something of (
the sort and Is looking forward to 1
some movement for a league of na- ?
lions to preserve peace as one of the
elements of the settlement of the ]
Avar. (
After reading the German note
(Carefully Secretary Lansing said that |
while there were some differences in j
translation when compared with the i
unolflcial copy and while the order of
arrangement of some of the paragraphs
was a little different, there
was absolutely no change in meaning.
Air. Lansing said the note would go
forward to the belligerents presuma
lily today and that no decision had
been reached as to whether the United
states would accompany it with any
expression.
The German note was the only one
to arrive. Nothing has been heard
?fc. of the communications from Austria.
