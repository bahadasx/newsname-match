forward with his choice of all eastern
Oregon eleven and classes It with
nny all star eleven yet picked. II
nays:
"There Is no way In which we can
determine the relative merits of the
different all star selections, but I be
lieve the following team would hold
Its own with any alt eaotern Oregon
high school team selected this year.
"ITlrlch, Pendleton; quarter back
and captain; Whipple, Baker, full
back; Fleetwood, Bakor, halfback;
Moon, La Grande, half back; Howard

Brown, Baker, and Ftledly, Pendle

"This team would defeat the best
collection of stars that the Willam
ette valley high schools could pre
duce. Comparative scores of the
past season will bear me out In this
utatement. I have watched high
ochool football In the valley closely
during the past four or five seasons
and I am convinced that the eastern
Oregon high schools play better ball
than the valley teams."

TO
BE 7 1 -2 MILLS
The Umatilla county tax levy for
state and county purposes next year
will in all probability be 7 1.3 mills,
the same as last year. This forecast
is based upon a computation from ths
figures representing the total assess
ed valuation and the total amount oi
money to be raised.
County Clerk Baling was this morn
ing notified that L'matilla county'
share of the state tax would be $122,
316.50 or about four and a half per
cent of the entire state tax. Assessor
C. P. Strain was notified that the
public service property in the county
is valued this year at $10,8S,693.15.
The arrival of these figures mad
possible the computation of the prob.
able levy.
The total assessed valuation of all
property in the county is $18,T0.
831.15. The budget recently adopted
by the county plus the amount of the
state tax is $339,416.50. The counts
will have a balance on hand at the
end of the year of approximately
$18,000 and w ill receive about $15,00i
from other sources than direct tax
ation. This leaves a little more than
$336,000 to be raised by tax and a
levy of J 1-2 mills would produce a
little le.-w than $336,000. It may be
necessary to make the levy 7.6 mills
