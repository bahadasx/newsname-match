Will Yisit Panama Canal.
Peter C. Forner, a United
States Marine from McConnells
burg, will visit the Panama Can
al, when the huge battleship Ver
mont completes her cruise in the
West Indies and sails for the
sthmus, in accordance with the
winter schedule of the Atlantic
leet.
Peter, v ho is a son of the late
David Forner of McConnellsburg,
enlisted in the United States Ma
rine Corps at its Waynesboro re
cruiting station on August 24,
1916, and he will perform his
regular military duties aboard
the Vermont while the dread-
naught steams through the wa
terway" from coast to coast.
Comparatively few Americans
are favored with an opportunity
to visit the great canal, and this
trip to the tropics, which has
been aptly timed to avoid the
rigors of a northern winter, will
doubtless prove very interesting
to Peter.
Get Easy.
Less than a week from this
time the 20th of December will
be here and the subscription price
of the Fulton County News will
be $1.50 a year. If you do not
get the News for a year or two
longer at a dollar it will be your
own fault, for we are accepting
and will continue to accept sub
scriptions at a dollar a year up
to next Wednesday evening. We
have entered the names of more
new subscribers on our list dur
ing the last two weeks than in a
long time. Persons that have
been thinking seriously about
taking the News, now find that
if they wait longer they must
pay more money, and they are
coming in while coming i3 good.
Very many who were in ar
rears a year or two, have paid up,
and have paid a year or two in
advance. We hope by next
Wednesday to have a paid up
subscription list and then our
subscribers w'll feel better and
we shall have a merrier Christ
mas and a happier New Year.
Railroad News.
Very little is to be told in ad
dition to that related in the News
last week. Contractor Coon who
went away to get money to pay
his subcontractors, has not re
turned. Tuesday upon execution
issued by the Lemaster National
Bank, 29 mules, 5 horses and
other personal effects of Coon
were sold by Sheriff Garland
The mules brought from $25 a
head to $262 a pair, and the
horses sold around $150 a piece.
The sale amounted to about
$4,000.00
It is believed by some, that
Coon will turn up one of these
days with money to pay up
everything and finish the rail
road. If that should prove to be
the case the News will let you
know.
Enters Suit for Libel.
Geo. A. Harris, president of
the Fulton County Bank, yester
day, through his attorney, O. C.
Bowers, entered a suit for libel
against the Franklin Repository
for alleged damages sustained
on account of statements pub
lished by the Repository in which
it was stated in substance that
Harris had given notes in con
nection with the failure of the
McConnellsburg and Fort Lou
don Railway. The truth about
the matter is, that Harris never
gave his own individual note nor
endorsed for others.

WAS IN ERROR.
niton Republican Makes Correction of
Article Published in Its Columns
Last Week.
The following correction and
apology will appear in this weeks'
Fulton Republican:
"In last week's issue we pub-
ished an article on the failure of
the Lemaster National Bank and
the McConnellsburg and Fort
Loudon Railroad, which article
was, in part, copied from Frank-
in Repository, a daily paper pub
ished at Chambersburg, Pa.
n said article it mentioned the
name of Geo. A. Harris, of this
place, who was quoted as having
signed or endorsed notes in con
nection with same. We have been
informed that Mr. Harris is not
corfnected in any way financially
with said bank or railroad and
has not signed any notes or be
come liable in any. way. We
copied the article from the Cham
bersburg paper as a matter of
news. We are sorry this has
happened and want to assure
all who read same that it was
not done to harm Mr. Harris."
Hale and Hearty.
Squire Daniel E. Fore, North
Second Street, who celebrated
his ninetieth birthday on the 26th
of last June, called at the News
office last Saturday afternoon and
after paying his paper up to date,
ordered it stopped. (That's
all right, now! If you take it in
til you are ninety years old, you
may stop it too and we'll not
kick about it )
After we had given him a re
ceipt for the trifle due on his
paper and assuring him that we
never sent the News to any one
after having been told to stop it,
he settled down in an easy chair,
and entertained us delightfully
with stories of his earlier life;
for the Squire's head is as clear
as a bell and he remembers and
describes events that occurred
three-score-and-ten years ago
down to the minutest detail with
perfect accuracy.
Mr. Fore was a Forty-niner in
California during the gold ex
citement Having left his Ful
ton County home, he was living
at Fairfield, Iowa, when he was
seized with a desire to see Cali
fornia. There was no fast trains
(nor slow ones, either) across
the continent at that time, and
the walking was not good; hence,
Mr. Fore worked his way down
to New Orleans, where he found
trading vessel just about to
leave for California via the Straits
of Magellan. Being a carpenter
Mr. Fore struck the Ship's Cap
tain for a job. One of the Ship's
carpenters had left the vessel at
New Orleans and the Captain
was only too glad for an oppor
tunity to hire Mr. Fore. The
long journey was made without
any unusal incident and he reach
ed California safe. While oh
the Coast, he turned his hand
to various things, among others,
carrying the mail a distance of
many miles into the interior of
the State on three mules.
After satisfying his spirit of
adventure and accumulating
$300.00, which sum ,it took to
bring him home, he embarked
on a vessel forAcapulco, Mexico;
thence, he traveled overland by
way of the city of Mexico, and
reached the eastern shore at
Vera Cruz; thence by boat to
New Orleans.
While Undertaker William
Stoner is regarded as one of Mc
Connellsburg's oldest citizens,
Squire says he has it on Bill by
a year and three months, as Mr,
Stoner was born in September
1827.
A. little party composed of Ja
cob Peck, Samuel A. Hess, Rach
el Mellott and Joseph and Sebina
Mellott, did the butchering for
Charlie H. Mellott on the N. H.
Peck farm in Belfast township,
last Thursday. Charlie had four
small pigs, the runtiest of which
weighed 443 lbs.'
From Barry I. Denisar.
Dec. 2nd: I see by the label on
my paper that lam in arrears; so
I am sending a money order to
put my name on the Honor Roll.
My address is Jordan, 'Mont,
instead of Antler, N. D. I am
on my way to my homestead of
320 acres, which is 17 miles from
a town and 80 miles from a rail
road. My nearest railroad town
in Glasgow.
I shipped 2 emigrant cars to
Glasgow. I have 11 head of cat
tle and 10 horses. We are now at
the Missouri river. We have
been here waiting for it to freeze
so we can cross. The river is 80
rods wide, it is frozen so the
ferry cannot run, but not hard
enough to carry horses and cat
tle. There is one man here that
is going to try to take his house
hold goods across to-day and I
will try crossing about the first
of next week if it keep on freez
ing. I was born in Fulton County
and lived there 18 years, I left
there in August 1900 and lived in
Illinois four years and in Iowa
six years. Then I moved to
North Dakota and have been
there six years. The Fulton
County News is like a weekly
letter from home. It is the first
paper I look at when the mail
comes and I always see something
about people I used to know.
I came from Antler to Glasgow
in my new 1917 Ford touring car
a distance of 302 miles. The
roads were so bad and so drifted
with snow that it took us three
days to make the trip.
There is lots of homestead
land here that is not taken; so, if
you know of anyone there that
wants to get a home of their
own send them to Jordan and I
will help them to get one.
I would like to go back to Ful
ton County to visit but not to
stay. I like the "wild and
woolly west"
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
and Happy New Year, I am,
Yours truly,
Harry I. Denisar.
rrom North Dakota.
Cando, Dec. 4. I see by the
paper that you are going to raise
the price of the paper after the
20th, so I am going to make use
of the time left and as the old
saying is, "Take the ox by the
horns" by sending enough to
last until the war is over and we
get back to cheaper rates again.
So here goes a money order for
$3.00, just push my subscription
as far ahead as it will reach.
Our crops last summer were
almost as bad as a failure on ac
count of the blight and rust It
killed the grain just in the milk
stage, and it shrank up almost to
nothing. There was a heavy
stand of straw, making the crop
expensive to harvest and thresh.
A good many farmers did not
get enough out of it to pay har
vesting and threshing expenses,
We had about 12,000 bushels of
grain all kinds but of a very
poor quality. We got from nine
ty-six cents to a dollar and forty'
seven cents a bushel for wheat
Cattle have been a pretty good
price here and the pasture was
good last summer. Stock of all
kinds did well, and are still doing
good as there is abundance of
hay and rough feed on the fields,
We had about two hundred acres
of wheat that we did not cut and
the stock is feeding on it, there
being no snow yet I sold 9 head
of young cattle this fall for $503
and I am wintering 37 head of
cattle and 45 head of horses and
colts.
We are trying to turn this into
a stock country instead of raising
so much wheat
Climatic conditions seem to be
changing against the raising of
wheat
With best wishes to "the News
and all. our old friends, I remain,
Yours truly,
Wm. King.

THE SERIOUSNESS OF SNEEZING.
Little Talks on Health and H;giene by
Samuel 0. Dixon, H. D., LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Let the innocent bystander
beware of the careless or ignor
ant individual who takes no pre
caution to cover the nose and
mouth to catch the spray when
sneezing. Such carelessness
should be resented as you would
resent the dangerous habit of
spitting.
When you sneeze, a spray of
the secretion from the mucous
membrane of the respiratory
tract and the throat is thrown
into the air for quite Borne dis
tance around you. This spray
often carries germs of diseases.
From some forms of leprosy and
tuberculosis, thousands of germs
that will produce those diseases,
are breathed in by those who
are standing within the zone of
the spray.
Many of the influenzas or so
called colds are communicated
from one person to another in
the same way. Some healthy
people have disease" producing
organisms that are sneezed out
and if taken into the respiratory
tract of others who have less re
sistance, they will fall victims to
whatever form of disease that
germ produces.
