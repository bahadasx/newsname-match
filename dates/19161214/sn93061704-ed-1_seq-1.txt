MOUNTAINAIR STATE
BANK IS NOW
INCORPORATED
Capital of $25,000 is Over
Subscribed in Less than
Two Days
READY FOR BUSINESS
ABOUT NEW YEARS
Stockholders arc All Home Peo
ple who are Interested
in Mountainair
The Mountainair State Bank, long a
dream, has been a reality Bince Tues
day noon, December 12th, the incor
poration having been perfected. The in
corporators are: H. F. Mathews, Jas.
H. Rhoades and J. N. Burton. The
capital stock will be distributed accord
ing to the subscription list, as soon as
the stock certificates, which have al
ready bten ordered, arrive. Upon the
arrival of these certificates the sub
scribers will be notified and their stock
issued upon payment of same. It
is hoped to have the im. jtion ready
for business about the first of the year.
Messrs. Mathews and Rhoades re
turned from Santa Fe yesterday noon,
and are busy looking after a location
and building for the new concern.
Furniture and fixtures have been or
dered and are expected to be here with
in a reasonable time.
Several parties have applied for
stock, since the whole of the capital
has been subscribed, so that there is a
waiting list, in case any of the original
subscribers should drop out for any
reason.
The long-needed bank of Mountain
air is to become a reality by the first
of the year or soon thereafter. Last
Saturday H. F. Mathews of the foot
hill country in the northwestern por
tion of the county was in Mountainair,
talking with the merchants and far
mers of this vicinity, and succeeded in
placing most of the stock necessary for
the organization of a bank here. By
noon Monday the last of the $25,000
capital stock necessary was subscribed
and Mr. Mathews left for Santa Fe to
go before the State Corporation Com
mission to secure the charter.
Mr. Mathews, who will be the princi
pal stockholder of the institution, has
been a resident of the county for some
ten years, and has been one of
the most successful farmers in the
whole county. He comes of a family
of bankers, having two brothers who
are succes-ful bankers in neighboring
states. Mr. J. N. Burton, recently
manager of the Estancia Lumber Com
pany will be the cashier of the new
bank. Mr. Burton has been connected
with the mercantile business during the
eight or nine years he has been in the
county. Prior to coming to the Estan
cia Valley he was connected with a
bank at Corpus Cristi, Texas, for six
years, so that he brings experience
along with his reputation for honesty
and upright dealings. All of the stock
holders are local men men who have
helped largely in the building of Moun
tainair, and whose faith in the future
of the town has never wavered.
Through its correspondents, the local
institution will be able to care for any
business which may arise in this vicini
ty, however large. The need of a bank
here has been keenly felt for some
time, and especially during the past
six months.
The Epworth League will give a So
cial at the Chapel some night during
Christmas, week.

MANUAL TRAINING
i
Manual training, domestic science
and agriculture are arousing keen in
terest in Torrance country, according
to the official report, made today by
County School Superintendent C. L.
Burt to State Industrial Supervisor I.
C. Mcrsfelder. His report pays a high
tribute to the rural school teachers
who show an interest in these branches
despite the fact that they are crowded
for time, owing to the many classes
they teach. Mr. Burt's report is as
follows:
"Mountainair, N. M., Dec. 7, 1916.
"Hon L. C. Mersf elder,
Santa Fe, N. M.
"Dear Sir In answer to your re
quest wish to present the report on
"MANUAL TRAINING
"Manual training is being taught in
all the town schools of the county and
in many of the rural schools. Owing
to lack of space and equipment the
amount of work being done is limited.
Several schools have purchased some
benches and other necessary equip
ment in order to make a start. The
work being done is of a practical na
ture and calculated to act as a stimu
lus for greater effort on the part of
the teacher and pupil.
"DOMESTIC SCIENCE
"Wherever I have been in the coun
ty I find interest being taken in this
branch. Cooking, sewing clubs, etc.,
are organized and teachers and pupils
alike are manifesting a greater inter
est than ever before especially in the
schools having more than one teacher.
I find that the teachers in the rural
schools are making the best of their
opportunities and giving their pupils
the best there is at hand when the
limited amount of equipment is taken
into consideration and time that can
be given to this work. The average
teacher in the rural school is crowded
for time to give much attention to this
work, but I am glad to state that the
teachers of Torrance county are always
ready and willing to make the best of
their equipment.
"Agriculture
"Agriculture is being handled with
better success than any other branch
of industrials. Owing to the fact that
this county has a real live wire in the
person of Mr. Harwell, the county
agent, much has been accomplished
in this line. Mr. Harwell is always
ready and willing to go into the schooj
room and give the teacher and pupils
pointers in their work. I find the
teachers as well as the boys and girls
taking a more active interest in agri
culture than ever before. Pig clubs,
bean clubs, corn clubs as well as ail
clubs that can be classed under the
head of agriculture are flourishing in
the county. Plans are already on foot
to make a larger and better demonstra
tion along this line in 1917 than ever
before. Working in conjunction with
the county agent we expect to have a
greater rivalry the coming season than
ever before. Boys and girls who were
successful last year and won the laurels
and went to the state fair have added a
wonderful stimulus to this work, others
declaring their intention to give more
and closer attention to their work the
coming year, so that they will get to
make the trip to the State fair."

TO INSTALL TELEPHONES
The farmers on the Mesa south of
Mountainair are working toward organ
izing a co-operative Telephone Line
among themselves and connecting with
the town. A number of these people
came here from places wheie rural
phone lives were in vogue and do not
feel at home without them. A com
munity without telephones in this day
and age, is not up-to-date, and these
people are to be congratulated on their
spirit of progress shown. Quite a num
ber have already signed up and others
are ready to do so. It is planned to
',et the line in working order before the
rush work next spring.
HAVE YOU HELPED?
There remain only ten more days for
some young bdy to win the $25.00 in
gold, offered as first prize by the Inde
pendent. Who will win it? If anyone
knows, they haven't told, who it is.
We believe that even the contestants
will be surprised when the voles are
counted, as a number have come in and
paid subscriptions, have taken their
votes and voted. We believe in several
instances the contestants are not aware
of these votes having been cast. It is
just possible that on account of such
votes being cast, the young ladies them
selves will be surprised when the votes
are finally counted, in receiving more
votes than they anticipated.
The next week should see a large
number of votes cast. The contes
tants should make a thorough canvass
and secure all the votes possible, as the
last few days will see the contestants
husWing as they have not done hereto
fore. The coupons we are issuing may be
voted any time up to 6 o'clock, Satur
day evening, December 23. They are
in the following amounts based on sub
scriptions of varying terms:
6 mos. Subscription, 1.00,- 200 votes
1 year's " 2.00, 500 "
2 " " 4.00, J250 "
3 " " 6.00, 2000 "
5 " " 10.00, 40000 ."
Arrangements have been made for
placing the ballot box at the Griffin
Drug Campnny's Store where coupons
may be voted for the candidates.
The following is the list of candidates
nominated to date:

Mr. Medley is erecting a new house.
Miss Ima Riddell has been on the sick
list.
Ira Bruce and family spent Sunday
with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. D. C.
Bruce.
Mr. Davis and family from Okla
homa arrived last week. They are visit
ing in the Medley home until they lo
cate. Sam Meyer, family, and Miss Hazel
Furman, were visitors in the Sellers
home Sunday. They were trying Sam's
new Ford.
Vernon Furman, wife and baby from
Vaughn arrived on Tuesday of this
week Mr. Furman has resigned his
position as teacher in the Vaughn
schools, in order to move on his home
stead southeast of Mountainair.
Mr. and Mrs. Sam Meyer entertained
the young people most pleasantly, Sat
urday night. The evening was spent
in playing games. All departed at a
late hour, expressing themselves as
having a most delightful time.
New Office at Quarai
A new postoffice is to be opened
shortly, or rather an old postoffice is to
be revived under a new name. Punta
has been without a postoffice, for some
time. Mrs. Rayos Sanchez de Atencio
has been appointed as postmistress, the
office to be known as Quarai. Thisname
is much more suitable than the old, the
pstoffice being but about a mile dis
tant from the ruins of the ancient pue
blo of La Quarai. The office will bs
served from Mountainair.
Mr. and Mrs. Atencio wore in Moun
tainair yesterday at which time they
mide the necessary bond. M.r. Aten
cio will be the assistant postmaster.
WHAT CAUSES DROUTH?
In recent conversation with farmerB
regarding the areas to be planted to
crops next year, I find that statements
are usually made with some provisos.
A composite statement might be given
as follows: "If the season is good I
will put in so many acres." It is like
wise true that throughout the growing
season we qualify our statements with
"ifs" that are directly related to soil
moisture. A great many people who
have studied the subjects of dry farm
ing closely believe that the question of
whether one succeeds or fails rests
largely with the man. Providence is
being blamed less and less as time goes
on for these failures.
The following on the subject of dry
farming is offered by John A. Widtsoe,
one of our best authorities on dry farm
ing. It seems very probable that this
holds true in so far as the agriculture
of" Torrance County is concerned. Take
it for what it is worth.
DROUTH
"Drouth is said to be the arch enemy
of the dry-farmer, but few agree upon
its meaning. For the purposes of this
volume, drouth may be defined as a
condition under which crops fail to ma
ture because of an insufficient supply
of water. Providence has generally
been charged with causing drouths, but
under the above definition, man is usual
ly the cause. Occasionally, relatively
dry years occur, but they are seldom
dry enough to cause crop failures if
proper methods of farming have been
practiced. There are four chief causes
of drouth: (1) Improper or careless pre
paration of the soil; (2) failure to store
the natural precipitation in the soil; (3)
failure to apply proper cultural methods
for keeping the moisture in the soil
needed by plants, and (4) sowing too
much seed for the available soil-moisture.
Crop failures due to untimely frosts,
blizzards, cyclones, tornadoes, or hail
may perhaps be charged to Providence,
b t the dryfarmer must accept the re
sponsibility for any crcp injury result
ing from drouth. A fairly accurate
knowledge of the climatic conditions of
the district, a good understanding of
the principles of agriculture without
irrigation under a low rainfall, and a
vigorous application of these principles
as adapted to the local climatic con
ditions will make dry-farm failures a
rarity."

SCHOllE MINES
ARE INCREASING
THEIR OUTPUT
Prof. Kirk of University of
New Mexico Visits
the Camp
NINE CARS SHIPPED
DURING PAST WEEK
Casin Strikes Good Ore in Shaft
at depth of about 100
Feet
That the minea at Scholle re be
coming more and more profitable,
more work is being done is proven by
the fact that during the past week nine
cars of ore were shipped to the smel
ters, and further that the ore now being;
taken out is of better grade than here
tofore.
Dr. W. B. Humphreys manager of
the Van Horn Consolidated Copper
Mining Company, has just sunk two
more shafts on the property of this
company, and has encountered ore of
good grade-better than that hereto
fore shipped from these holdings. He
loaded two cars of forty-two tons each
during the past week. This company
will begin the erection of cabins and
bunk houses for the miners at once, to
be prepared for tne winter.
Prof. Kirk, of the State University,
has made an inspection trip to Scholle
and is highly gratified at what he saw
while there. He reports quite favora
bly on the workings and the grade of
ore now being taken out.
Mr. Casin, who has holdings along
side those of the Blue Star Mining.
Company, has just completed a shaft,
having encountered splendid ore at a
depth of one hundred thirteen feet. In
fact the ore encountered is reported as
being quite similar to that being taken
from the mines of the Cavins company.
It is reported that Mr. Casin has a very
tempting offer for his holdings.
