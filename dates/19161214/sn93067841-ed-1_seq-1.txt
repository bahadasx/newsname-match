News dispatches from Berlin say
that Germany proposes peace to
Allies.
The imperial chancellor, Dr von
Bethmann-Hnllweg. speaking for the
German empire and its allies, Austria-Hungary,
Bulgaria and Turkey,
announced in the reichstag that he
had given to the diplomatic representatives
of Spain, the United States
and Switzerland, a joint note addressed
to Germany's enemies, proposi
g to them to *-nter into peice
neg riations.
Tin' chancellor did not announce
the teiuis upon which Germany and
her allies will make peace. Nor are
they contained in the note he hand
ed to the three diplomats ior transmission
to the entente powers.
The only reference he made to them
was that they had the object of
"guaranteeing the existence, honor
and liberty of evolution" for nations
extending the offer and "are according
to their firm belief an appropriate
basis for the establishment of everlss'ing
peace."
This reference is contained in the
note addressed to the allies. The
representatives of Spain, the United
| States and Switzerland were selected
for the transmission, because
these countries represent the entente
interests in Germany and the
countries of her allies.
Simultaneously with the issuance
of the note to the allies Germany
sent a communication to Pope Benedict,
through the German minister
' to the Vatican, Dr Otto von Muehl
?;flr Clar
" Derg, nouryiug me iajuuu ui \jcmany's
peace move, eulogizing the
Holy Father for his efforts in behalf
of peace during the last two years
and expressing the confidence that
Germany's initiative "will find a
friendly welcome on the part of His
' Holiness and that the work of peace
can count upon the precious support
of the Holy See."
Throughout the chancellor's
peech, and both in the note to the
entente and that to the pope, emphasis
is laid upon these chief points:
That the peice move is made "in
full harmony" with each of Germany's
allies.
That not weakness, but strength, I
coupled with solicitude for civilization
and humanity, prompt the offer
of peace.
That if this offer falls upon deaf
ears in the entente countries, the responsibility
of the terrors that a
further prolongation of the struggle
are bound to bring is solely that of
Germany's enemies. The German

His closing words were:
"We are ready for fighting, and
j ready for peace."
Based upon information from their
; home governments, the entente dip- j
I lomats believe Germany's terms are
; in general about as follows:
Restoration of Belgium, with the
1 condition which would practically
i leave it under German control and
| probably give over the port of Antwerp
to Germany.
Restoration of the occupied portions
of Northern France, but with
economic control, which would guarantee
to Germany supplies of iron
and other raw materials drawn
; from there.
Domination of Mesopotamia by
Germany and Austria to give them
a path to the Persian Gulf and break
England's gateway to India and
Egypt.
To award to Bulgaria ail of Serbia
as far south as Nish, which would
take from Serbia as much territory
as she gained in the Balkan Wars.
They expect Germany will demand ;
the return of her African colonies
or at least propose to exchange |
them for the French colonies.
Turkey's interests are considered
a minor affair and not fully developed
in consideration of peace.
I The attitude of the Balkan nations;
| of the Germanic allies, it was ex-!
plained, will be set forth in the,
notes that have been dispatched from i
Sofia and Constantinople; nothing of I
them is known at the Balkan legations
here, except that Bulgaria.
