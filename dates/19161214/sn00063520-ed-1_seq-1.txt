H. C l.eveiis, county judge of
Harney county, and mayor of the
the thriviug city of Hums was In On
tario Monday enroiite for I'ortland.
He will attend the meeilng of the
inuuty judges of (lie state In session
there this week. With him waa W.
A KobbliiH, who Is one of the Har
ney county commissioner.
While In Ontario Judge Levens
took little time to discus matter of
the county court. What he did talk
about, however, waa that which I on
the minds of every citizen of Burns
and the Interior country the rail
road from Crane to Burns which
James K Weston propose to build
At the present time, according to
Judge I.evens the feature of the pro
posed road is the fact that the Boise
capitalist whom Mr. Weatou succeed
ed In interesting have gone to the ex
pense of seudiug a crew of engineers
to Ihe field tn make a survey and de
termine ivery factor connected with
the enterprise Not only are tln-v
MirwiiiK a route, but they are also
making hhiiumhs to determine what
traffic cm he secured for the road
On this point largely depends their
furtherance of the proposition If
iln-v can determine whether or not
the road can develop sufficient traf
fic to pay dividend soon after it Is
built, they will furnish the necessary
capital.
The making of these Investigations
is in the hands of Engineer Franklin
a liolse who came out on Monday
alto, but he did not discus what his
work bo far had revealed. Mr
Franklin proceeded to Boise while the
other Burn men went on to Portland.
