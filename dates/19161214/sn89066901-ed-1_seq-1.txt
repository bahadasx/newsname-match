- The boys' game was played
first, and it was not long Jif ter
the start nntil it ' was apparent
that it wasonly a question of how
V large a score Mansfield would

work showed the result of drill
.' in team play and demonstrated
the superiority of a team without
" a star in contrast to the idea of
' individual brilliancy. The final
score was Man'stield 33; Swymonr
. The Mansfield girls played
hard and eonsistent, and won a
much dearved victory, Ui score

Recording of Frisco Deeds
The most lengthy instrument
ever recorded In Wright.county,
was that tiled in the office of
Recorder Alvali Richardson in
Hartville, in which the right-of-way
of the old St. Loui9 and San
Francisco Railroad Company is
deeded to the new St. Louis-aa
Francisco Railroad Company, i
The instruments," Which .wtown;-.'He-. was a membVr of the
filed by Fred Williams of Spring
field,! anv attorney for the road,
included 164,510 words, and the
fee for 'placing Hon the records
was $125. Vfe'y
i Tlie . change of. the deeds was
made necessary by the ' recent
sale and reorganisation of the
railroad company, at which time
the name was changed from St.
It mis and San Francisco Railroad
Company to St. Louis San Fran
cisco Railroad Company. .'
;' This' change in name, which
was necessary n;ord? to make
legal the transfer of the projier
ty f rom , the old company to Uie

thousands of dollars to the com
ens tr quote m? Jus saying in your
valuable medium, Is buuk if you 'add
an 'early to It v
;1t was aboutrbanksgi,Tlng time, if
I recollect rightly, that we were first
j admonished to do, our Christmas' shop
ping early. It struck me as the proper
: thine to do. I decided I'd do It. - r
"Naturally, the thought first came
to me what to give myself for Chrlst-
mas. i anrays nana m.vsen some siicai
token of my esteem at the happy yule-
tide. It -compensates for what other
folks band me... A. little lflt. doesn't
have to cost very much' to make a
lilt with me if I give It to myself with
the proper spirit. - ''
"It's the giving, rattier than the re-
ralvlnir nf thl ftt thnt hrinea me the
pleasure, anyway. -
. "Vell, gasoline has been going up
pretty steadily lately you notice I do
not talk in dialect in spite of my rural
name and predilections; if I talked In
dialect I would, say gas wag goln' up
purty stlddy and, due to the increased
cost of living expenses, I decided that
lt behooved me to economize.
x decided on a haircut for my
to get It early on account of the poor,
tired shopgirls who are wishing the
' store would close so they can crowd
in a few more dances with the dashing
young ribbon clerks three, aisles over,
i "Whereupon I got a haircut, a good.
short one. ,
"The rest of the story Is soon told.
I got It cut again last, night, and 1
had to wait for six -customers ahead
of me who were telling the barbers to'
have 'em extra close so it would last
over to Monday; -
-'"That much for early Christmas
shopping. I bought the junk for the
folks after they'd locked the street
doors last night and have just been
making the rounds of tlie drag stores
to pick up the oddsand ends, I've for
gotten. No more Christmas'-shopping
in mine. Olddap, Dobbin.". .
And. with a peremptory cluck to his
steed, Timothy Hay motored away in
high dudgeon, Denver Times.
Vany, as the lengtky ' .deeds to the
right-of-way , mtsfc be recorded
in every count.'.; traversed by the
Frisco lines in the various states
The instruments were two deeds
and three.. mortgages..
