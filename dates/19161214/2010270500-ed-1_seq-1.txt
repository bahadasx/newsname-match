mission has issued an order requir
ing the Chicago, St. Paul, Minne
apolis and Omaha railroad to ap
pear December 19 and show cause
why it should not be forced to rein
state the train service on the Nor
folk line which existed prior to No
vember 26, and make stops at both
Dakota City and South Sioux City.
Announcement of the commission's
order was received at South Sioux
City yesterday. At the hearing in
Lincoln on the 19th the Dakota City
commercial club and the South Sioux"
City council will be represented by
attorneys who have been engaged to
present the cause of the two com
munities. Hardship to travelers
living in Dakota county is charged
as a result of the railroad's refusal
to stop its Norfolk branch trains at
the points mentioned. The railroad
is alleged to have abandoned the lo
cal stops in Dakota county in order
to frustrate passengers from Sioux
City who had acquired the habit of
taking trains at South Sioux City or
Dakota City in order to evade the
interstate passenger rate, which is
higher than the Nebraska interstate
rate.

tion against the time card comes
from Sioux City traveling men and
not from the residents of the two
towns. The state railroad commis
sion has power to order the road to
show cause immediately why it
should not go back to the old time
card, ino rauroau company may
question the .right of the commission
on the ground that the trains out pf
Sioux City are interstate trains not
under control of the state commis
sion. .If an emergency is not de
clared the railroad company would
be entitleJ to lifteen days' notice of
a hearing. . . .Hubbard, Nebr., prob
ably will join South Sioux City and
Dakota City in appealing to the state
railway commission against the ac
tion of the Chicago, St. Paul, Min
neapolis and Omaha railroad in re
fusing to stop its trains at that
town, Ward M. Evans, corporation
attorney for South Sioux City, said
yesterday. Four towns have been
omitted in the railroad's stop sched
ule, according to Mr Evans". The
fourth town is Nacora. The formal
complaint of South Sioux City to
the railroad commission was sent to
Lincoln yesterday by Attorney Ev
ans. The allegations of the formal
complaint are: That the Bervico has
been discontinued; that South Sioux
City is badly in need of it: that all
.residents there must now pay bridge
tollB both wayst when traveling on
the1 Norfolk division; that to travel
to Norfolk aqd to points west the
last chance to go is at 2:55 o'clock in
ths afternoon, and this necessitates
a change of cars and several hours'
Btop at Emerson, and that the city
is discriminated against by the or
der. Farm Profits

matic conditions determine them?

that they shall bo Just at onco to tho

7. Tho federal government should

8. Tho law should rccognlzo tho es

is not tho only fair criterion.
0. Tho law should expressly provldo

"My legal proposition," Mr. Thom
Bald, "Is that tho Constitution as it
now is gives full authority to Congress
to regulate tho Instrumentalities of In
terstate commerce In nil their parts.
If tho power of regulation is to reach
tho public requirements, it must bo co
extensive with tho instrumentalities of
commerce."
Mr. Tbom explained that tho roads
aro not asking cither of the Committee
or of Congress any Increase in reve
nues, but that they aro merely nsklug

rise.
Principles Which Railways Hold Should

pulsory 8ystem of Federal Incorpo
ration Favored.
Washington, Dec. 4. That tho inter
ests of national defenso requlro that
control of railway lines should rest
with tho federal government and not
with tho states was tho claim ad
vanced by Alfred P. Thom, counsel
to tho Railway Executives' Advisory
Committee, la concluding his prelim
inary statement of tho caso for tho
railways before the Newlands Jolut
Committee on Intcrstato Commerce.
"Wo must bo efficient as a nation If
we aro to deal successfully with our
national emergencies," said Mr. Thom,
"and wo must appreciate that efficient
transportation is an essenUal condlUon
of national efficiency. If wo aro to
halt and weaken our transportation
systems by state lines, by tho perma
nent imposition of burdens by unwlso
regulation, wo will make national effi
ciency impossible."
Statss' Rlahts Would Not Suffer.
Mr. Thom cited many Instances In
which shippers in ono Btnto wero in
juriously affected by selfish regula
tions' imposed on tho railroads by
neighboring states. Ho pointed out
that federal regulation would bo no In
vasion of tho rights of tho states but
would bo tho means of preserving tho
rights which they acquired when they
entered thoeTJnlon, ono of which was
tho right to tho frco movement ot their
products across stato boundaries.
What the iRatlroada Advocate.
Tho principles which tho railroads
bcllovo should bo incorporated In any
Just system of regulation wero sum
marized by Mr. Thom as follows: .
1. Tho entire power and duty of reg
ulation Bhould bo in tho hands of tho
national government, except as to mat
ters so essentially local and Incidental
that they cannot bo used to lnterforo
with tho efficiency of tho scrvlco or tho
Just rights of tho curriers.
2. As one of tho means of accom
plishing this, a system of compulsory
federal Incorporation should bo adopt
ed, into which should bo brought all
railroad corporations engaged in Inter
stato or foreign commerce.
S. Tho Intcrstato Commcrco Commis
sion under existing laws has too muck
to do and is charged with conflicting
funcUons, Including tho investigation,
proaecuUqn and decision of cases. Tho

Short Course Next Week
ArrnnEements are partially com
plete for the Short Course at Dako
ta City next week.
While a great deal of work and
time have been expended in this, it
is felt that all will be amply repaid
for the trouble.
The men's section will begin at 9
a. m. and last till 3:80 p. m. daily.
and the women' section will begin a
half hour later, or at 9:30. Both
sections will begin on Tuesday, morn
ing will run until I'riday evening,
the men's section will meet in the
high school building.
On Monday evening thero will be
an address by Prof. C. W. Pugsley
of the State University of Nebraska,
on "Tho Keal Rural Prdblems."
This mcetting is of exceptional mer
it and we urge everybody who can,
to nttend, both men and women.
Tho committees who have made
arrangements, appreciate tho loyal
support of the people in making this
course possible, and now wait your
further cooperation in making it a
success.
An agricultural short course is an
innovation in Dakota countyt'and
being the first one, there will be
some mistakes made. We hope they
will be few and of minor impor
tance. Tho four instructors who will bo
hero for tho week aro the best in
the Extension service. They como
without any expense whatever to
the local people. However, the local
management must furnish accommo
dation while they aro here, and to
meet the same and other incidental
expenses, like material, printing etc.
a small admission must be charged. '
Season tickets can bo procured for
the men for $1.00, for tho women
for 50c. These will be good for the ,
entire week.
Friday afternoon has been set as
the time for tho meeting of tho boys
and girls who have conducted club
work this past year, and wo hope
you will all be in. Tho stato leaders
will bo able to be with us then, and
will give an interesting ahd instruct
ive talk.
