fine morning to realize that you
did a mighty wise thing when
you started in to boost for the
old home town. Your communi
ty stock is preferred stock. You
are in on the ground floor. You
know just what's going on. You
are helping to run things. You
have a say on every question.
Every man in the community is
your partner. There may be a
few dead partners in the bunch,
but there are not many. There
may be a few who are not loyal
to the home town, but. don't fret
about it. Some folks, you know,
are built that way, and it takes
time for them to get the vision.
For yourself you stick by the
live ones. They are the men
who are helping to make your
' community stock valuable-cmen
who are giving you their support
men who, by all means, should
have your support. You need
the live ones in your business.
Your town, the town in which
you are a stock-holder, could not
run without them.

Departed
An automobile accident oc
curred last Tuesday afternoon
tbout two o'clock, which cost
Chas. B. Riley of this place his
life.
Mr. Riley was presumably on
his way to Fowler to get some
repairs for. his car, a Ford. As
he passed the Pitts farm house,
four miles north of Meade, mem
bers of that family noticed that
he was working on the the car,
very likely adjusting the car
buretor, and was driving ' per
haps thirty miles per hour. A
few minutes later they observed
the car, overturned, only a short
distance north of where they
had first noticed him. As there
were no rough places in the road
at that point of sufficient size to
overturn a car, it is reasonable
to suppose that while adjusting
the carburetor and at the same
time steering the car, it left the
road, and in giving a quick turn
to right it; the front wheels
turned too far and locked, caus
ing it to turn turtle. Mr. Riley
was thrown out of the car and
against the side of the road ; the
car was turned, completely
around and lay on his , body.
When picked up by Claud Was
son and Roy Ohare, who were a
short distance behind him when
the accident happened, and who
arrived upon the scene only a
few minutes later, life was ex
tinct. The body was brought to
Meade and placed in the Fletcher
undertaking rooms to await the
arrival of relatives in the event
that any can be located.
Mr. Riley came to Meade from
California in July, 1915, and im
mediately secured employment
from M. E. Dahmer, west of
Meade. To members of that
family he stated that he had two
brothers, one in Fargo, North
Dakota, and one in St. Paul, Min
nesota ; also that his mother was
living, part of the time with one
brother and the remainder with
the other. He was born in Roch
ester, N. Y., January 16, 1883.
Messages have thus far failed to
locate relatives. In the event
that none are found he will be
buried this afternoon in Grace
land Cemetery.
Mr. Riley was perhaps six feet
two inches in height and
weighed about 215 pounds, and
was dark complexioned. He was
a young man of good habits, and
was well thought of by his em
ployer and, by others as well.
Frank Gouty died at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Lewis,
where he roomed. Saturday
morning, December 9th. The de
ceased came to Meade in June, in
the hope of regaining his health,
and apparently was much im
proved. About a week before
his death he seemed worse, ,and
it soon became evident that the
end was near.
The deceased was about twenty-two
years of age, and was
highly spoken of by all who
knew him. His parents reside in
Covington, Indiana, where the
remains were taken Sunday, ac
companied by L. A. Smith, an
uncle.
A large bunch of carnations,
presented by his friends, indicat
ed the high regard they had for
him. At the time of his death,
h is physician, Dr. Roushrand his
two room mates, C. L. Wallace
and F. R. Allerton, were present.
H. M. Coon has received an ap
pointment to the position of as
sistant quartermaster at the
State Soldiers' Home at. Ft.
Dodge and departed for ' that
place the first of the week to as
sume his duties. His family will
leave sometime this week. Mr.
Coon is well known to our people,
and is qualified in every way to
fill the position. Governor Cap
per could have made no better
selection. At the time of receiv
ing the appointment Mr. Coon
was engaged in . farming and
stock-raising on his farm south
east of Meade. We regret to lose
Mr. Coon from our county, but
rojoice with him in his good for
tune, v.nd wish him luck.
It is with no regret that we
note the return of J. B. Miller to
the Kansas Newspaper field. Mr.
Miller made his first appearance
in this section of the country at
Liberal, from there he came to
Meade and edited this paper un
der the reign of The Meade Pub
lishing Company. From here he
went to Bucklin and purchased
the Bucklin Banner, and after
remaining there for several
years, decided to quit the news
paper game, sold to T. C. Perry,
ancj for a time took life easy.
Then he "got the bug" again,
and purchased a paper some
where in Oklahoma, we never
knew where, but he didn't stay
long, and now the next we hear
of him, he has purchased the
Liberal Democrat, and we hope
has come back to these parts to
stay. For one thing we are truly
thankful, he has at last secured
a paper of his own political
faith, and can boost the Demo
crats to "beat the band." . In
this respect he has been "like a
fish out of water" ever since we
have known him. When in
Meade the News was independ
ent in politics, and being only
one paper in Bucklin, the same
was true of that paper, but now
John can write Democratic edi
torials to his heart's content,
and, we are betting that he does
too.
Increased Wheat Acreage in ...
Kansas
Leading wheat experts in Kan
sas are telling the newspapers
that the acreage this fall is the
largest in the state's history.
Secretary Mohler of the State
Board of Agriculture has called
for detailed reports from his
township representatives, and
will have the exact figures short
ly. The general guess is that
the acreage will run about nine
millions. A great ileal of the
showing was late, to dodge the
hessian fly'. Wheat put in early
is coming along nicely, there
having been sufficient moisture
for its needs.
Mrs. S. D. Adamn left to-day
lor a few days stay '.n Hutchinson.

Kansas Cattle
The total number of Kansas
cattle is 2,187,723, exclusive of
milk cows, according to this
year's census enumeration com
piled at the office of J. C. Mohler,
secretary of the state board of
agriculture. This is a gain of
nearly 14 Der cent in the vear.
and is the first time since 1909
when the number has exceeded
the two million mark, the report,
which is based on March 1 re
turns, shows. "This increase
may be accounted for, in part at
least, by the fact that Kansas
farmers are engaging more ex
tensively in the breeding busi
ness," said Mr. Mohler. "The
most beef cattle Kansas ever had
was 2,757,542 head, in 1904."
Sunday School Entertained
Mrs. Ed Desmarias most de
lightfully entertained the mem
bers of her Sunday School class
of the M. E. Church, last Tues
day afternoon at her home, twen
ty miles southeast of Meade.
The Meade delegation went via
auto, and at their destination
were joined by a number of the
ladies of Lakeland. Together
they partook of a bounteous tur
key dinner and spent the re
mainder of the day in story-telling,
doing fancy work, and do
ing stunts. Mrs. Judson F.
Hulburt, of Lakeland, rendered
several guitar selections, and
Mrs. Desmarias gave two read
ings The event wa9 compli
mentary to Mrs. Desmarias'
sister, Mrs. Donald Loikhart,
of Howard, Kansas. Before de
parting Mrs. Desmarias' guests
voted her a most royal entertain
er. Irs. R. R. Shannon, who was
formerly Miss Flossie Woodward
ward, returned to her home in
Hutchinson last Tuesday, after
visiting a few days with her par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Wood-ard.
