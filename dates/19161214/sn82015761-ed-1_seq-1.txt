STREET SIGN FI
HAS JEEN RAISED
Work on Signs Begun Signs
Will Be in Place About Jan.
First
Realizing the benefit which
signs bearing the street names
would be to Williams, if put up
at the intersection of streets,
the News suggested some time
ago that the work be under-
taken. Failing to get others in
terested to take ahold of the
project, the News decided to
undertake the work itself. An
estimate of the cost of putting
up signs for the principal part
of Town was obtained and the
News made a proposition to
the Town Council to raise one
half of the cost of street signs
on condition that the Council
appropriate a sum to cover the
other half. The estimated cost
fell a little below $40.00.
At the Council meeting last,
Tuesday evening.Dec. 5, the
Council received the News'
proposition and immediately
appropriated $20 for the Town
half of the expense. It was
then up to the News to secure
the other half. A subscription
heading was prepared and a
circulation of 30 minutes was
sufficient to secure the money.
Williams business men subs
cribed Very willingly, all seeing
the advantage street signs
would be to the Town.
The work of preparing the
signs is "under way and this
work will be completed and
the signs up by Jan. 1, if the
weather does not interfere1 too
much with the work.
In putting up street signs for
the benefit of our people and
for the benefit of strangers in
our Town, Williams is putting
on metropolitan airs, but none
too soon. We have not realized
the importance of our Town.
The signs will be evidence of
a dawning recognition of the
fact that Williams is an indust
rial and commercial center for
important interests, and that
the appearance of the Town
should be in keeping with its
present status and evident des
tiny. The News has other plans
for Williams and in the near
future they will be explained
and exploited. The News pro-
poses to be a live wire for
bringing these plans for muni
cipal betterment to early frui
tion. Read the columns of the
News carefully each week and
try to get the Town spirit with
which is the hope to inspire
all. We must all get it and by
pulling together mountains of
difficulty will become mere
mole hills.
Visit to Dam Deferred
The committee appointed by
the Town Council to visit the
dam of the' Williams Water
and Electric Co., to invesigate
the improvements which the
company is making will defer
its visit until the work on the
dam has been carried furthur.
The News will send a repre
sentative with the committee
and report on the conditions at
the dam.

DO YOUR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AT
HOME AND DO YOUR SHOPPING NOW
Now is the TIME to do your Christmas shopping
and your home town is the PLACE. Look over the
Holiday goods of the various advertisers in the News,
and you will find goods of every description and value.
What is more, you knowithe goods are reliable because
the firms are reliable. You cannot always say that of
goods purchased out of town.
We especially recommend News advertisers to
you because they represent the live and public spirited
merchants of the town. They are alive to every op
portunity to secure good goods at the best possible
prices, for you. Their public spirit is displayed by the
generosity with which they back every movement for
the Town's general good.
When you spend a dollar with these merchants,
you receive a part of it back in the form of improved
schools, better streets, better policing and the other
advantages which taxes buy. In addition to this the
liberal contributions which these merchants make to
churches and all other public benefit organizations
and movements, reflect to the benefit of all. The
foreign merchant pays no taxes and makes no contri
butions for the good of the community. In short, the
mail order man would ruin your school and your town '
with all the advantages that they give you. You can
not afford to encourage his business.
Do your Christmas shopping at home and do it
NOW. It will PAY You.

PROSPEGT FOR PEACE
NOW FAVORABLE
Central Powers A Unit
in
PeaceOffer Fighting to Con
tinue Until Entente Powers
Accept.
After two years and four
months of the bloodiest fight
ing the world has ever known
the German Kaiser has reach
ed the conclusion that enough
blood has been shed and trea
sure destroyed. He has con
vinced the world, he thinks,
that Germany is unconquerable
and that point settled, heis not
only willing but anxious to su
spend hostilities and arrange
terms of peace which shall se
cure all nations against a repet
ition of the awful catastrophe
from which Europe is suffering
directly and the whole world
more or less, indirectly.
Germany's allies unite with
the dominant Central Power in
the peace offer. For Germany
the Kaiser asks the restoration
of the conquered German col
onies in Africa and he is wil
ling to restore Belgium to her
people and surrender the occu
pied portions of France. How
ever, until the Entente Powers
see fit to entertain the Kaiser's
proposition and agree to an
armstice, fighting will go on.
The Kaiser's offer has been
transmitted to the neutral gov
ernments of the United States,
Switzerland and Spain and al
so to the Pope with the request
that the Entente Powers be
notified of the peace offer. No
reply is expected from the En
tente Powers until the full text
of the Kaiser's offer has been
received.

GROWERS .
Discussions were Pertinent
and Interesting Organiza
tion was Completed by Ap
pointment of Committees.
Eleven new members added
The Tusayan Cattle Growers
Association had a very good
meeting Monday afternoon.
The attendance was good and
much enthusiam was manifest
ed. The meeting was called to
order by Chairman Ed Hamil
ton a little before three o'clock.
The chairman read the call for
the meeting. The minutes of
two previous meetings were
summarized by the Secretary,
Dick Kennerdell, who stated
that the Constitution and By
laws of the Coconino Cattle
Growers Association had been
adopted for the Tusayan Cattle
Growers Association, with
some modifications.
Mr. Harold Green, Forest
Supervisor, was invited to ad
dress the meeting in regard to
the proposal to add land to the
Forest Reserve. Permittees
present desired to know the ad
vantage to cattle growers of
such additions. Mr. Green
J T A? ' A 1- "
gave mem miormauon on mis
point. Mr. R. C. Wente mov
ed that a committee of three be
appointed by the Chair to con
fer with the Forest Service
about the proposed additions.
The motion was seconded and
discussed only to be withdrawn
in response to the. sentiment
that the users of such lands
should first consult with the
Forest Service and make satis
factory arrangements if. possi-
This discussion was under
the program item : "Changes in.
Forest Boundaries." The next
subject proposed by the pro
gram was "Increase of Grazing
fees by Forest Service.. The
Forest Service is considering an
increase to be added each year.
The opinion of the meeting was
that such increase would be un
just to the cattle growers of
Arizona, for the reason that
the expense of water, in this
country is so great. Tanks
must be constructed at large
expense, while in most other
cattle countries flowing water
abounds. On motion by Mr.
Kennerdell, a committee con
sisting of Messrs Kennerdell,.
Holden and Ren Sweeetwood
was appointed by the Chair to
confer with the National Cattle
Growers Association and pro
test against the increase.
The next subject discussed
was the system for accounting
for stock killed by railroads.'
The present system had no de
fenders. Cattlemen stated
that many cattle are killed
which are never accounted for.
Formerly information as to cat
tle killed could be obtained at
the roadmaster's office and
thru section formen, but now
such information is lodged
with the division superintend
ent. On suggestion by Chair
man Hamilton Mr. Kennerdell
moved that a legislative com
mittee of three be appointed to
confer with legislators and
especially those of Coconino
county with a view to securing
legislation to install a better
accounting system for stock ;
killed by the railroads. The
