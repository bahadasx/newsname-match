The city council at its regular
meeting Tuesday night, without
a dissenting vote, passed Ordi
nance' No. 151, granting a fran
chise for forty-nine years, to the
Southwest Missouri Railway com
pany, permitting that company to
build and operate an electric in
terurban railroad on certain streets
in Baxter Springs. The ordin
ance is published in full elsewhere
in this paper.
A. H. Rogers, president of the
railroad company, and E. J. Pratt,
the superintendent, were present
at the council meeting. Mr,
Rogers spoke briefly before the
council took np the ordinance
question.
He stated that the work of
constructing the line from Toplin
to Baxter would be taken up just
as soon as the company and the
city of Galena had settled its
differences, and that would not
be long for his company was pre
pared with surveys, etc., to build
the line from here whether the
line went into Galena or not The
I company has under consideration
an air line from here toJophn
that would run south of Galena
and would cut down the running
time by several minutes. Quick
service of course is what is de
sired here.
"It is possible," Mr. Rogers
stated to the council, "that my
company will yet-decide to build
a line from Baxter southwest
through the Picher-Baxter mining
district and put it in operation
before the line from Joplin here is
started." This statement, though
tentative, was received with much
! enthusiasm by the number of
citizens present Railroad com
munication between here and the
new mining district is the thing
much needed here and prospects
of its realization coming now
from Mr. Rogers surely was good
news.
Richard Flood, representing the
Oklahoma & Northern railroad,
proposed to run from Bartlesville
to Baxter, was present and enter
ed a plea for the consideration of
his company s request for franchise
to come into the city on West
Sheridan street, a street included
in the Southwest-Missouri franchise.
Mayor Willard informed Mr.
Flood that the council could not
consider his application at this
time. After the passage of the
ordinance Mr. Rogers publicly
assured Mr. Flood that he would
gladly co-operate with the Bartles
ville gentlemen in providing a
right of way for their line into
this city and should they wish
they might run their trains into
the city over the Southwest Mis
souri tracks. It is believed that
the Oklahoma people will be
-
taken care of nicely when the
time comes to pass on their appli
cation for a franchise.
Mr. Rogers was greatly pleased
with the friendly spirit manifested
by the city council and Baxter
people generally for bis companyf
and freely expressed, his belie
that Baxter would have a popula
tion of 10,000 two .years hence.
Another happy person is J. W.
Grantham, who worked incessantly
for months to induce Mr. Rogers'
comoanv to build to Baxter
and open the new mining district
to this city. "We are now on
the map. as the Gateway City,
the entrance to the greatest lead
and zinc field in the world, and
that is name that Baxter should
adoot as its slogan.' said ' Mr.
Grantham to the New's man.
That's food. too. Baxter the
