KING TOO RIGID
DISCIPLINARIAN
Aldermen With Large Dis

- '-
The Republican ' aldermen who are
the Republican members of the com
mon council seems at hand and the
next meeting ;; of the council, on th
evening of Dec. 18, is likelyv to - wit
ness the most serious deflection since
the organization of John , T. King got
Control in local Republican politics.
The disciplining of several of. the
aldermen and the fact that old mem
bers of the board have been dropped
from important committees this year,
because in the last year they had not
always rendered prompt and supine
obedience to the dictates of the bpss
are said to be the reasons why a fili
buster will be begun anid continued
during the entire session.
The Rtpublican aldermen who are
ready to, become insurgents, with one
exception, are not new members of the
board. They have been before the
voters of their districts several times
for endorsement, and. they feel that
they -were returned , each time by the
cdurtesy and' efforts of . their personal
followers, rather than by theaid which
the machine s gave them.' As one of
the disgruntled ones put it after the
Republican caucus the other night at

Alderman primrose for president in
stead of Alderman MacFayden:
"We are . here; In spite . of the ma

out of place ,rn- public life or in the
party.any Republican officiaJ who hes-

Premier, said: ' , . ;;
"The' government will ask , you to

crees all questions of interest in re
gard to the national defense which
the laws are" too slow to regulate. A
particularly grave question which can
be regulated only in war time,, the
solution of which involves the life of
the country and its salvation is '; the
total suppression of the ' consumption

Out Many of Claims
:, Against Tracy Estate
' Claims against . the estate of Cath

dent, have been reduced ! from $1,
599.19 to $545.80, and if Judge Mill
er allows the finding made by the spe

and William P. Crowley, the estate
will be solvent. Mrs.' Tracy, at her
death, made bequests totaling nearly
$r,000, among them .'being several .to
priests and a small bequest to St.
