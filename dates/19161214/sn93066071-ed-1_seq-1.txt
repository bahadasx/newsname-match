tional bonds Tor the extension anil Im
provement of the water and light sys
tems, carried by the necessary major
ity, which prove again that lleavor
resident are fully alive and awake to
tho best interclta of the town, and aro
not going to hold back on legitimate,
expense, even though It does goa little
high at times. It was clearly evident
to all that the voting of tho additional
bonds at this time was extremely nec
essary, for, If wo are going to have
water and lights at all, we want them
all the time, and the present equip
ment was inadequate to meet the de
mands. We understand that Immedi
ate attention will be given to enlarg
ing the plant, and that the extension
of the lights and water will follow as
soon as practicable.

L01 THE BEAUTIFUL
The ground Is covered this' morning
with a hlanl.et of white, of about three
inches in depth. This is the ilrst moist
ure of any moment, which has fallen
for many months, and It certainly will
ho hailed with delight. While a deeper
snow nt this timo would have been
acceptable, yet thejp tlireo Inches will
be of great benefit, and here's hopin'
that the weather man will continue
along this line.

tended and much enjoyed by nil pres

plies, was a burlesque on Woman Suff
rage, nod those taking part did credit
to themselves. They exemplitied, in
an exaggerated way, how women would
rule and "Hubby" was shown his place
In the kitchen and at tho wash tub.
The entire program provoked much
merriment and was heartily enjoyed
Refreshments were served by tho
Suffragettes' husbands nnd, bedecked
with aprous and naps, they proved that

AUTO TURNS TURTLE.
The machine in which the Btaver
high school boys were returning from
the basket ball game at Cat's, Saturday
night turned turtle, spilling out thu
occupants and bruising them consider
ably, but doing no serious damage or
injury. The accident was caused by
somo dirt being piled in the roadway,
and the-car, which was running with
out lights, struck it and skidded. Next
time, we venture tho assertion, the
boys will see to it that their car Is
equipped with lights before they start
out In the nfght. They are pretty sore
(Over the fall), but since they carried
off the honors In thu game. Ihey are
nursing their bruises cheerfully.

We don't claim to know anything about
