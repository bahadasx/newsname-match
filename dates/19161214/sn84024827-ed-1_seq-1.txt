BERLIN, De. 13. (by wireless)
Dr. Alfred Ziminermann, secretary for
foreign affairs, discussed today with
a member of the staff of the Overseas
News Agency the impresrion created
in Germany by the attitude of the
United States toward Germany and
Great Britain as outlined in the As
sociated Press Washington dispatch
of November 19. Dr. Zimim rmann
said:
Divided At First
"As to the Impression created: Al
most since the beginning of the war
two currents of opinion could be di-
ceroed In Germany. Judgine by the
rules of neutrality, the United States
intentionally favored Great Britain in
almost outspoken fashion, according
to some; others took tht view that
the United States was neural in H'ir-
it and at tion. The discission be-j
tween the advocates of t:use two op'n
ions was sometimes vry animated.
This discussion was reopened by the
dispatch in question.
Believers Shocked
The parties and newspapers that
did not believe that America was ob
serving strict neutrality accepted the
dispatch as confirmation of their
opinion and to the others c.nie as a
shock. , .'

"In order to understand this effect
one has only to recall the large nuin

Bonus For Sinkings
"The London nmes of jvovemDer

known member of parliament and ;
ship owner (Robert P. Houston) who j
promised to every English born cap-
tain a prize of L2.000 to every Eng-
liuh merrliant shin that destroyed a
German submarine.- Houston was
fully convinced that he advised act- claim, however, that the fact that be

German Ships Sunk
"We further know that hostile sub
marines have attacked and in some
instances have sunk German mer
chantmen without the slightest warn
ing. Thus were sunk the German
steamers Burgemeister, Votmelle,
Dorlta. The Elbe and Hollacdia. They
were all attacked by enemy submar
ines with artillery or torpedoes with-,
out the shadow of a wanting. j
"These facts, of course. Justify the j
suspicion that among other German j
steamers which are simply overdue or
heve not returned, several met their!
mil in the same fashion. In one case,
that of the steamer Kolga, we know it
from survivors. In this case, seven,
lives were lost and the Burvlvors de
clared that a British submarine calm
ly steered around the sinking ship
without even stirring a hand towards
rescue. I merely refer to this In or
der to explain the feeling of the Ger
man population.
"Germany, on the other hand, has
promised the United States to carry
on submarine war according to the in
ternational rules of cruiser warfare."

EXPLOSION
(By Review leased Wire)
PITTSBURG, Kansas, Dec. 13.
Twenty miners were killed and
seven injured in an explosion late
today in the Reedy and Ryan coal
mine at Stone City, fifteen miles
southwest of here. The injured
men will recover, it was believed.
A combination gas and powder ex
plosion is believed to have been
the cause of the disaster but the
state mine experts have not yet
been able to make a thorough ex
amination. The killed and injured were
working in the south part of the
mine while thirty three men were
busy in the north drifts.
A driver heard a rumbling noise,
followed shortly by smoke which
began to pour out cf the south
entrance. The alarm was given
and the members in the north
drifts began to emerge.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 13. Cap
tain Franz von Papen, former military
attache to the German embassy in
Washington, recalled some time ago
at the request of the United States
government, was mentioned today by
Louis J. Smith, the government's star
witness against the German consul
general. Franz Bopp, and six others

graphed Baron E. H. Schack, another

believing von Schack to be the consul.
He was asked why he did not go to
von Papen.
The telegram was dated "Cedar

The reply read:
"Advise by wire your exact address
