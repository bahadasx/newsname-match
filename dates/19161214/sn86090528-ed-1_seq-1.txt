Terms for Settlement
By United Press,
London. Den. II. Sentiment in
creased today in favor of including in
England's answer to the German
peace proposals a clear and explicit
definition of the basic terms that will
he demanded by the allies.
It is certain that the answer will be
the rejection of the proposals at this
time hut it is felt in many quarter?
that 'the allies should meet the Ger
man diplomatic strategy by sending
a note as a counter move to put tho
allies on record as the first of the two
sides to make definite demands and
concessions.
The comment made by the Pall Mall
Gazette is typical of the utterances of
the British press. "We do not see
v. hy the allies should not turn the in
cident to their credit by a fresh, vig
orous proclamation of -the fundamen
tals and sources involved in the war.

Tokio and the provisional capitals of
Serbia, Koumania and Belgium.

ries of confidential soundings at all
belligerent capitals to determine the
positions of the various governments

HILLCREST
MAY NOT
BE NAME
Cemetery Board of Trustees May Cast
About for Another Name for City
Cemetery
The beautiful name of Hillcrost will
probably not be adopted by the trus
tees of the city cemetery in exchange
for the Odd Fellows cemetery under
which the city burial grounds have so
long been known.
Hillcrest was the choice of Mrs.
Smith, who was probably most -losely
identified with the improvements
thereon, but out of deference to Mr.
and Mrs. J. D. Chastain, whose impos
ing home south of Chickasl'a has for
ten ypars borne that name and as
jrmca'of tuo corfespoiufence comes in
that name, city officials believe it
would be advisable to not adopt it.
While ;he deeds . to the cemetery
were made out in the name of Hill
crest, ft will riot be a difficult matter
to remedy this.
The council was to have taken defi
nite action in the matter this evening
but it is now believed that considera
tion of a new name will be deferred.

ANADARKO
Lively Meeting Held Last Night by Finance
Committee of Anadarko Ozark
Trail Association
Chickasha good roads boosters put
life Into a meeting at Anadarko last
night of the finance committee of the
Anadarko Ozark Trail association.
The meeting was called to order by
Chairman John Pugh, who stated the
purpose to be tho formulation of some
practical plan to" finance improve
ments for the Ozark Trail through
Caddo county.
C. M. Hollingsworth was called up
on'' to give a talk on tho roads and
plans of Grady county. He explained
that County Commissioner Robinson
intended to perfect the road from
Chickasha to Pocasset with the aid of
donations from Chickasha to put in
three culverts.
County Commissioner Jim Kobinson
of Grady explained in detail the char
acter of road required for the Ozark
trail and what was meant by a hard
surface road.
John Owsley, one of the Chickasha
bunch, was the life of the meeting
He introduced the delation from
Chickasha and told tho people of Cad
do county that Grady county was
ready and anxious to join hands with
them in the great ork of getting the
Ozark trail. "United we stand, divid
ed we fall," ho said and told the people
of Anadarko to get busy at once as
each moment from now on counted.
Mr. Owsley's remarks were well re
ceived. Mr. Ballinger of AnanarKo moved
that all Caddo county towns prepare
and submit estimates of the cost of
building tL? rosd through their county
and after arriving at the ii.i.ures that
each town and township bt-;sr its part
of the expense. This motion carried.
County Commissioner Volimer of
Caddo stated that although $10,000
had been voted for good roads In that
county the fund is not available until
August 1 and could not be u: od by the
county until that date. This condi
tion, he said, was annoying as work
on these roads should begin at once.
Mr. Colo, a banker of Carnegie, said
he was willing to take $5,000 of this
fund and put up the cash at once and
that he believed the other bankers of
Caddo county would advance tho oth
er $5,000 in order to make the fund im
mediately available.
.Mr. Volimer added that the county'
had a convict gang consisting of eight
mule teams and fifteen men who could
be put to work at once on the roads.
Mr. Owsley spoke several times and
stirred the meeting to enthusiasm.
E. I. Bitsche also made a few re
marks urging those who were inter
ested in good roads and in the Ozark
Trail proposition to get busy as no
time was to be lost in putting the
roads in shape before the time for in
spection. The Chickasha delegation consisted
of John T. Owsley, vi e president of
the Grady County Highway associa
tion, Conde McGinley. secretary of the
association, C. E. Schow,. Arthur Ers
land, Charles Hollingsworth, E. I.
Bitsche, Ike Means and J. A. Robin

IMPORTANT MEETING
ON IN WASHINGTON
Oklahoma Publishers Will Meet in January
to Consider Matter Which Threat
ens Disaster
By United Press.
Ada, Okla., Dec. 14. Although the
publishers of Oklahoma newspapers
will not bo officially represented in the
meeting in Washington, D. C, tomor
row, called to consider tho serious pa
per situation, the matter will be tak'en
up at a meeting to be held soon at the
state capital, Byron Norrel, president
of the State Press association announc
ed today.
The members of the press associa
tion will hold a mid-winter meeting at
Oklahoma Cits' in January and will ue-
fide on some course of action for deal-
ing with tho print paper problem,
During the past year paper has donh.
led in price and tho present situation
threatens to drive some publishers
out of business unless prompt relief is
obtained.
UNCIL TO
AVE BUSY
SSION
While it is thought the regular ses
sion of the city council tonight may
be a long one it is not believed that
all matters awaiting its attention will
be taken up. The regular monthly
business will bo transacted, the ap
proval of bills, tho receiving of month
ly reports and other minor matters but
it is doubtful whether action will be
taken .in the new building ordinance
until an engagement can be made with
representatives of the underwriters
bureau, to be here. Some of the claus
es in the model presented for the con
sideration of the council are of such
a character that councumen are not
disposed to adopt them as a whole
and it 13 thought advisable to have
an understanding with the state insur
ance board as to what part of the
model may be omitted without subject
ing tho city to a demotion on the rat
ing card.
The expenses of running the city for
the past month have totalled $1,647.74
which Includes the sum of $236.34
which was included in the initial pay
ment of $3,000 for the new fire engine.
The motor fire truck is proving to
be a very slight monthly expense to :
the city. Notwithstanding the numer
ous test runs which were made during
tho instruction of drivers and the al-
most daily practice, the cost of main- j
tenance up to dale hi been 'jut $21. i
It is estimated that the monthly cost i
later on w ill be reduced to about $10.
The engine is in splendid working or
der and has not yet failed to respond
to every demand made upon it.

COPYING PENCILS
ADVANCE IN PRICE
Those office men in Chickasha who
are addicted to the use of good copy
ing pencils are feeling the advanced
prices caused by the war and the dif
ficulty of obtaining supplies of their
favorite brands.
For several years lit the county
clerk's office A. W. Faber's Castell
has becu used to advantage and whole
sale orders have been repeatedly plac
ed at eleven cents each. The last son
signmcnt cost twenty-one cents whole
sale and the Oklahoma agent will not
take orders for that or other brands
of copying pencils and guarantee de
livery. Tho Mephisto, another German pen
cil has advanced from 7 and cents to
12 and 13 cents wholesale.

WW
Important Progressive Measure to Be Pre
sented to Legislature to Uphold
Prices of State Products
NESBITT BILL PROVIDES
Each County to Have Farm Demonstrator
to Organize Community and County
Associations
By United Presa.
Oklahoma City, Dec. 14 Probably
the most progressive, most far reach
ing, and most needed piece of legisla
tion that will be offered for enactment
during tho sixth legislature, to con
vene January 2, will be the Nesbitt
bill proposing the creation of a state
marketing commission. The proposed
bill aims directly at the root o the
marketing evil In the state, and makes
provision for an organization that will'
allow Oklahoma farmers, truck and
fruit growers to compete with Califor
nia products on the commission mar
kets of Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas
City and Minneapolis.
Oklahoma grown apples ana other
fruits won't rot under the trees by the
thousand:) of bushels as ii. the past,
nor will Oklahoma farm land, so adap
ted by favorable climate and soil to
growing vegetables und other produce
remain uncultivated because, of poor
prices paid for products, If the bill
goes through.
This i roposed sqheme for market
ing the state's products, It is planned,
will be brought about as follows:
zA bill will be introduced in the house
by Representative Paul Nesbitt, Mc
Alester, calling for the creation of a
state market commission.
The president of the state board of
agriculture as chairman, th director of
the farm extension bureau as the sec
ond member, and a third, an expert
on markets, to be selected by the first 1
o, will make up the state market
commission. It's duties will be to di
rect the new move.
Each county will have a rarm dem
onstrator, an employe of the market
commission, whose duty It will be to
organize community and County mar
keting associations.
Community and county unus will do
their selling through an agent.
Commission houses in Chicago, St. '
Louis, Kansas Cir.y, Minneapolis, or
anywhere else, will do their ordering
through the unit agent. If threo car
loads of garden truck are wanted, such
an order will be filled by the partic
ular unit or organization In the state
that grows the product. II apples are
wanted, the Ozark country will fill
the order, etc.
That high prices will be secured for
the products seems cortain. Commis
sion men want only high grade goods
and pay high grade prices. Oklaho
ma producers, under the impetus of
the move, will grow tho best that can
be grown, will create a demand for
their goods on the market, and the
price will be high enough to make it
profitable.
"I fliink the plan can be extended to
take iu poultry and poultry products,"
said Nesbitt to the United Press, "and
to other articles, and for which we
must seek markets away from home.
There has been nothing jusst likd it
enacted before. I talked with com
mission men as far north as Minneap
olis and they declared that if Oklaho
ma would pass such a law, they would
send another man to buy our stuff.
All that they would do would be to
wire in the order."
