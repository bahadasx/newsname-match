E s. Millsaps of Statesville, district
jseiu Farmers' Co-operative Demon
stration Work, is expected in Hender.
Olivine the first Monday in January
and j. largo and representative gather
jrff of te farmers of the county is de
5,tYi on that date.
' In addition to 'ookini into the mar. j
ter of employing -i iarm aerr.onstrai or
for Henderson county, Mr. Millsaps
also explain tne law m regard to j
a farm loan association for the county
and if enough are interested will or- !
anize the association on the spot. For ,
these reasons, both of which are vital 1
(0 farmers, it is aesirea to nave us
many here on that date as possible.
In a letter to A. S. Truex, acting sec
retary or the Hendersonvilie Board of
Trade. Mr. Millsaps says:
-I have your favor of the 9th in
stant, and I thank you for the interest
you manifest in the great work of
building up the agriculture of the
county. If all the farmers were as
much interested in this work as the
business men we would not have such
bard work to keep things going. The
only thing I have to criticize is that
you say you want to 'urge the county
commissioners to appoint a Farm De
monstrator.' We do not want them
to appoint one. We want them to rive
half the money to run the work, or to
par the salary of the agent. We will
consult with them about the appoint
ment, but we cannot leave the selec
tion of the man to them. We have to
be responsible and we must know the
sort of man we have on the job.
"I think I shall try to go to Hender
sonvilie the first Monday in January,
but I would like to kill two birds with
one stone. So far as I know you have
no Farm Loan Association, and i
would like for you to have all the
farmers in the county who would like
to have a Government loan to meet
there on the first Monday in January,
and I will explain the law and organ
ize an association, if enough applications-are
..made by that time.'"i'liO0"
jou will take enough interest in this
matter to get the farmers out. Tqis
is a great thing for farmers who need
to borrow money."
It might be a good idea for all far
mers who wish to make application
for a loan to write to Mr. K. S. Al.il
saps at Statesville, N. C, at once so he
can have something tangible to work
upon when he arrives here. The Hust
ler sees great things in store for the
farmers of Henderson county and will
do all it can to further their interests,
and in doinp this it can hope for no
direct financial benefit. The Board of
Trade will also back every movement
that will lead to the upbuilding of the
county and city. Organization and co
operation is a great thing for the far
mers if they can only be made to re
alize this fact.

a good attendance. After devotional
exercises and some very important
business was attended to.ice cream and
cake was served. After the lefreah-

his appearance and invited the ladjes
into the dining room to see what Santa
Claus had brought, for tucked away
under the seat and in the back of each
vehicle each and every -lady had
brought a nice parcel of seme kind to
show their love and appreciation for
the pastor and his family. After they
had heard a few words of thanks and
appreciation from the pastor, a beau
tiful Thanksgiving prayer was offered
to the One who we owe all our. thanks,
and the ladles jjidew-er adiea

better by having been there.
The hum of the shredder has ceased

"Thanks to God" Our
Song of Life
Thanks to God" may be your open
ing and closing song. One brief life may
be a life of gratitude. Have you a home?
Then be thankful for it, however hum
ble the home may be, for roses will
not bloom more beautifully and the
vines will not more gracefully cling to
any other home. Have you friends?
Cherish every friend you possess, for
really you haven't as many as you
think. Have you parents now alive?
Cherish with fondness their every
presence, for the time is not far away
when you will look for them and they
will not be here. Have you a brother, a
sister? Make them feel your great and
human worth by thoughtfulness and
kindness to them.
So, friends, let the great past sweep
before our memories, have the nation
bow its to the Almighty God and
let the Individual ipeak out his grati
tude, and, after all is said, there will
remain many more blessings which
call for our thanks as eloquently aa
those we have mentioned. Some of
yoti may have seen the Sistine Madon
na at Dresden, In some respects the
most wonderful picture of materna'
loTe which exists in the whole world.
For a long time the canvas was cov
ered wilh a crust of ImpuriTieg gather
ed from Its years of hanging, and an
artist, in making repairs, discovered
a cherub face In the dark background
and wan kd t suspect the pK-ture had
been overlaid Iy tlrne and neglect. He
commenced cleaning it. and as he went
on cherul iiftcr cherub reappeared un
til it vns found that this priceless Ma
donna w.-is n i background made- up
wholly of little heavenly cherubs. So
those blessings for which we should
give thanks are sometimes shamefully
covered by our thoughtlessness -and
neglect. -ricv. V. A. Rupert of Pitta-burgh.

Durant estate for John Maybank of
unarieston. workmen are at wjrk
now on the excavations for the foun
dations and the building is to go right
up at once. The price on this house
is not given out but it is said that it

most expensive home3 in this section.
Mr. Maybank and family have been
spending their summers here for many
years, occupying their home on their
large estate just back of the site of the
new building place. It has not been
