stock of lumber they have sawed

4,130,000 Lb Beans.
We have been at some pains
this week to find out how many
cars of beans have been shipped
out of the county to date.
It is not an easy matter to run
this down, but it has been learned
that to date 118 ears have been
shipped. It has not been possible
to get the exact weights of these
cars. Some have contained 40,
000 pounds, and some less, so the
weights at this time can only be
estimated. It is probable that
the cars have averaged not less
than 35,000 pounds. If this is
correct, the shipments to date
aggregate not less than 4,130,000
pounds, for which growers have
received about $270,000.
An estimate of the beans yet to
be shipped can but be guess work
but it is probably not less; than 50
cars.Estancia News-Herald.

It may be interesting to some
of our readers to know, as com
pared with neighboring states,
the revenues from automobiles
and other motor vehicles which
are placed to the credit of high
way building funds. The state
engineer's report shows the aver
age fee for licenses of motor ve
hicles of all kinds in Arizona, to
be $5.88 per vehicle. The same
average in California is $12.28.
The number of licenses issued in
Arizona is just under the twelve
thousand mark. In California
around two hundred and fifty
thousand. The approximate rev
enues from licenses m Arizona is
$70,560.00 per year, as compared
with $3,070,000.00 in iCalifornia.

THE BOYCOTT.
o
(By James J. Montague)
When eggs are a dollar a dozen,
And meat is a quarter a bite,
And even the price of such fodder as rice
Is soaring away out of sight,
You'll find, if you just do without 'em,
There will soon be an oversupply,
And there's never a doubt, if you'll only hold out,
That the price will come down by and by.
43
You can cut out the milk
r4ie cake and the bread and the pie;
The pickles ancLjam and the ham and the lamb
You can swear that you simply won't buy,
And the men who are boosting the prices
Will not have a thing they cancel.
And inside of a year there'll be nothingtirfear
From the terrible H.
Of course you will starve in the meantime;
Inside of a fortnight or two
The willow will wave o'er your neat little grave,
And prices won't interest you.
No doubt there is also a boycott
By which you could safeguard your pelf
By saving a lot on your burial plot
But figuie that out for yourself!

BOOZE UNTIL JAN. 1
Governor Hunt ha decided to
let the booze flow into Arizona un
til the end of the year. Senator
Ives, Governor Hunt's attorney,
has advised him to give the out
side liquor .houses and the car
riers two weeks' notice after the
vote is canvassed by the secretary
of state, so that they may get all
of the shipments delivered If
the governor would issue the
proclamation declaring the law in
effect just as soon as the vote is
canvassed, as contemplated by the
constitution, the carriers would
be caught with a lot of undeliver
ed liquor on their hands and, un
der the law, there would be noth
ing to do but destroy it, as the
law prohibits the movement of
liquor in the state. Ex
Hon. J. F. Church, of Denver,
Colo., is a business visitor here
