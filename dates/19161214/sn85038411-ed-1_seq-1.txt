GOVERNOR ASKS
RESIGNATION OF I
A. NEVIN POMEROY!
Neither Rrumbaugh Nor Su

Discuss the Matter
OTHER CHANGES RUMORED

He May Have Statement to
Make Tomorrow
i
Governor Martin G. Brumbaugh to- i
day asked Superintendent of ■
Printing and Binding A. Nevin Pome- !
roy to resign. Mr. Pomeroy said he j
would consider the matter and will j
make a statement to-morrow.
!
The Governor's action in asking the!
retirement of the Chambersburg pub- j
lisher is the first move in the. way of,
a drastic campaign to secure the se-l
lection of Representative Edwin R.!
Cox, of Philadelphia, as the Republi- j
can candidate for speaker. For days >
there have been rumors that the Gov-j
ernor contemplated either asking.
some of the officials for their resigna- j
tions or making removals as object !
lessons to those lukewarm in support of
the Cox candidacy or who have been j
classed as "disloyal" by the State ad-1
ministration men who are active in I
promoting Cox's boom. The Governor j
lias been urged to this course by a 1
number of his advisers, including At-,
torney General Brown, who has de
sired a campaign to a finish and lias |
had the problem under consideration j
lor days. The names of half a dozen!
officials have been mentioned as likely
to go, but the Governor always refused j
to talk.
Neither Will Talk
During the morning he sent for Mr.'
Pomeroy and saw him shortly before j
1 o'clock in the executive offices. The;
Governor was asked as he was leav-1
ing the Capitol to take a train fori
Washington to attend the White |
llouso dinner, whether he had asked i
Mr. Pomeroy to resign.
"I have nothing to say," replied thej
Governor.
Mr. Pomeroy. when asked if the re
port that he had been asked to resign j
was true, replied: "I have been asked :
by the Governor to resign; but I have
nothing'to say now."
"What are you going to do?"
"I am going to consult my friends.!
I will have nothing to say to-day. 1 :
may say something to-morrow. I will
by that time have determined upon
my course."
"What reason did the Governor give I
for asking your resignation "
"Now, that is for the Governor to j
say. See him."
"But he won't talk."
"Neither will I now."
No Fault With Efficiency
It is intimated about the Capitol ;
that the Governor found no fault with
the efficiency of Pomeroy's department :
or with the way he had performed
his duties, which have been enor- \
mously increased through the print
ing requirements under the acts of
last year, but that he put it on the 1
ground of "political disloyalty."
For months it lias been rumored
that Pomeroy would be asked to resign
because administration men have con- j
tended that he was not for the Brum- j
baugh delegates in the Seventeenth
Congressional district, but for the men <

Total Prohibition of
All Alcoholic Drinks
in France Decided On
Paris. Dec. 14. Total prohibition
throughout France of the consumption
of such alcoholic beverages as whisky,
brandies and liquors have been decided
on by the government. This is shown
by the text in the Journal Offlcel to
day of Premier Briand's declaration
yesterday before the Chamber of
Deputies on the subject. The premier
said:
"The government will ask you to
give it the faculty of solving by de
crees all questions of interest in re
gard to the national defense which the
laws are too slow to regulate. A
particularly grave question which can
be regulated only in war time, the
solution of which involves the life of
the country and its salvation, is the
total suppression of the consumption
of alcohol."
The premier's remarks were greeted
with loud applause from many of the
benches. Deputy Mayeras interject
ed: "In the army also?"
"Yes, In the entire country," said
the premier.
The use of the term alcohol in this
connection is understood in France to
include such beverages as absinthe,
which already has been suppressed;
whiskies, brandies and liquors, but not
wines or beer.

HEALTH BOARD
ORDERS PROPER .
ASH RECEIVERS
Residents Musi Provide Proper
ly Covered Cans For Con
tractor's Convenience
FINES FOR VIOLATIONS
SSO Penalty Will Be Imposed;
Effective After January
j ; l, 1917
Emphatic orders to the household
ers of Ilarrlsburg to provide the re
quired type of metal receptacles for
ashes and rubbish in accordance with
the city health bureau regulations
were issue dto-day by Dr. J. M. J. Rau
nick, chief of the bureau of health.
The action was taken by the health
authorities at a meeting yesterday and
the health officer's instructions were
back up by his departmental chief.
City Commissioner Harry F. Bowman,
superintendent of public safety.
' In connection with the health bu
reau's orders," said Mr. Bowman,
"you can say that if, upon investiga
tion of complaints of any resident
as to the failure of the garbage con
tractor to make collections, it be found
that the contracting company has re
fused to collect the ashes, etc.-, from
proper receptacles, the company will
be lined SSO for each violation.
"If, on the other hand, it is found
that the citizen hasn't complied with
the regulations by providing the
proper cans, he will bfe subject to
prosecution."
The new order, which becomes ef
fective January 1, 1917, is as follows:
"On account of the large number
of varied receptacles used as ash con
tainers. by many of our people, too
much time Is lost and the ash col
lectors cannot cover their scheduled
routes.
"As a result of this unsatisfactory
condition of affairs, this bureau is
forced to require ail householders to
provide themselves with regulation
covered metal ash cans, as specified
in the contract.
"Beginning January 1, 1917, the
contractor will refuse to collect ashes,
and other rubbish, unless same is
placed in metal cans of not less than
one. nor more than two, bushels ca
pacity.
"Ashes and other rubbish will be
removed from the ground floor only
I in apartment houses, if placed in reg
lulation cans."
