"Tbe war and car hortage," de
dared Secretary C. D. M in ton in hia
annual report Monday afternoon, "must
be given the blame for the lack of
preparation for the 31a t annual meet
ing of the Oregon State Horticultural
Society. 1 have been 10 busy that I
could not give the matter my closest
attention, and my associate have been
too busy to reply promptly to my let
ters. And I know, after walking your
streets and teeing the applea piled in
vacant business houses that you of
Hood River will understand."
The opening session, scheduled for
Monday morning, was postponed, Mr.
Minton and A. P. Bateham having
been the only out of town men present.
While Pres. R. C. Washburn, of Cen
tral Point, arrived for Tuesday's ses
sions, be was absent Monday, and J. L.
Carter occupied the chair.
Tbe horticulturists were welcpmed
by Mayor Durable, who, while be char
acterised himself as a fountain pen
farmer, lauded the society for the work
it had done in lifting the business of
farming to a higher plane.
M"I hire my work done," said Dr.
Dumble, who has developed two ex
tensive tracts here, "and wield my
pen to pay the bills, but 1 realize the
great good your organisation has done
in standardising and making more per
fect the pack of fruit."
For the most part the first afternoon
meeting touched on the technical side
of orcharding. Talks on spraying were
given by Leroy Childs, of the experi
ment station, and F. A. Frazier, a
spray manufactureer of Seattle.
Only a hint was given of tbe serious
car shortage problem. In his annual
report Secretary Minton suggested as
a possible prevention of future such
trouble that the transportation com
pany be forced by law to pay the ship
per a demurrage charge for all days of
delay in getting rolling stock after it
bad been ordered lor products. Mr.
Minton also urged that steps be taken to
secure legislative appropriation to be
used in paying expenses of the society.
1 H. M. Williamson, of Portland, read
a memorial tribute to the late Dr. J.
R. Cardwell, one of the founders of
the society, and a short address, recal
ling the work of Dr. Cardwell was
given by E. L. Smith. A memorial
paper for the late Frank W. Powers,
former secretary of the society, pre
pared by Homer C. Atwell, was read
by Secretary Minton.
(J. U. Brown, horticulturist of the lo
cal experiment station, delivered an
address on tbe influences of commercial
fertilisers in orcharding.
The following out of town fruit men
registered at the society headquarters

The thirty-second annual meeting or
the State Horticultural Society will be
held in Salem next year, and Robert
Paulus, manager of the Salem Fruit
Union, was named as next year a pres
ident. Other officers elected were: Dr.
H. Bailey, of Rdseburg, vice presi
dent, succeeding V. M. Johnson, of
Corvallis, and C. D. Minton, of Port-
snd. reelected secretary. A. P. Bate
ham was reelected to the board of trus
tees. Other trustees are Judge Chas.
McNary, of Salem, and Albert Brown
ell. While the horticultural convention
was slow in getting started, but few
members having shown up for attend
ance Monday, Tuesday's sessions have
created more than usual interest, and
the Commercial Club quarters have
been crowded, more than 100 local orch
ardists having been in attendance.
Following a talk on pruning this alter
noon by A. B. Gardiner, of the OreRon
Agricultural College, discussions on tbe
more absorbing topics of the day, grad
ing rules and marketing, were launched
in addresses delivered by the following:
E. H. Shepard, Wilmer Sieg and C. A.
Malboeuf, the latter general manager
of the Western Oregon Fruit Dietirb
utors.
Dealing with the subject. "What
Shall We Pack in Apples," Mr. Shep
ard made the declaration that the eost
of growing a box of apples was 30 cents
and that another 90 cents was required
in the expenditure of packing and mar
keting. Unless growers can get this
price for a box of a certain variety, he
said, it should De eliminated, air.
Shepard further declared tnat growers,
unless they were selling tneir cuu ap
pies product for at least 69 cents per
box in the open market, packed, they
would find it more profitable to dispose
of it to by-products plants at the rate
of $6 per ton.
Touching on tbe subject or a standard
system of grading rulea for the four
northwestern apple states uregon,
Washington. Idaho and Montana Mr.
Sbeparo said that such plana were im
possible of practical solution.
"II such a system is adopted," said
Mr. Shepard. "it will soon be found
that it will be necessary to aet it aside,
aa wss the case in Washington last
year. Each district roust make its own
grading rulea. ur course, we snouia
have some standardized law that will
prohibit the shipment of-pples that
earry diseases.
Mr. Shepard further suggested that
a saving in tbe preparation of apples
for market would be effected if instead
of the three sradee extra fancy, fancy
and C arade as now is generally in
cluded in norbtweatern grading rules.
but two sradea were used. He sug
eested that the extra fancy grade
should consists of as perfect apples as
possible, and that the beat of the C
grade fruit be packed with the fancy,
the combination to be called "a stand
ard arade." Mr. Shepard would have
the worst of tbe C grade product dis
posed of to bv-Droducta plants.
Mr, Sieif. while he agreed with Mr,
Shepard in tbe main as to tbe former's
refussl to accent a standardised system
for the Northwest, he declared that
grower! would never get away from
the C grade apple.
"The instant that you put a C grade
apple in the fancy pack, be declared.
"you are going to lower tbe entire. box
of apples to the third grade. "0n& am
Mr. Sieg went even further than Mr.
Shepard, however, in decrying th pro
posed four state standard grading
rules. "We must await each season
and aee just what our erop is going to
turn out, and then make rulea to con
form to the erop. Otherwise we are
not going to live up to our rulea."
Mr. Sieg threw the first stsrtlers into
tbe sessions of the eonvention, when he
characterised the effort of the Office
of Markets of the United States De
partment of Agriculture to aid fruit
growers by supervising tbe orgamza
tion of the rrult Urowrs' Agency at
Spokane aa failure. He referred to
te Growers' Agency aa a "deutral neuter."
"Gentlemen," he modified his re
marks, "1 do not desire to be mean.
Hut the government has done us no
good because of tbe fact that it ; has
failed to include in its organization
some 60 per cent of the shippers and
growers ol tbe northwest, and this 60
per cent is tearing down all that the
Growers' Agenoy is trying to build np.
. i i i
iou cannui cava goon amesmansnip
without good organization. Tbe indi
vidual districts themselves must get
together, and then work in cooperation
through some method of centralization."
Mr. Sieg declared that the North
western fruit industry 'sworst enemy
was the grower who refused to organ-
ze.
The moat malicious and meanest
man 1 have ever run across. "the said,
is the man who perhaps has been ac
customed to tbe softness and eaBy
things of life, but who has eome to the
appto district and has made a failure.
You will And him against everything."
During bis address. Mr. Sieg stated
that despite talk of the stringent car
shortage, a total of 11,800 carloads of
apples had already been shipped (this
season, more than had been shipped
out during the entire marketing season
of last year.
Mr. Malboeuf, whose subject was.
'Has High Apple Grading Paid During
1916," made the emphatic assertion
that it bad. "To lower grading." he
said, "would mean a step backward.
We find that Cashmere and Mosier fruit
sties agencies have been building for
years on the maintenance of stringent
grading rules, ihey have been suc
cessful. Do we find that they want to
change?"
Mr. Malboeuf paid a tribute to the
apple men of the White Salmon com
munity. He declared that they would
emerge next season as one of the
strong fruit districts of the northwest.
This year." said Mr. Malboeuf,
'the growers of White Salmon have
welcomed the closest inspection. But
next year they are going to further
standardize their grade of apples by
building at central points four com
munity packing houses."
Business gave way to sentiment at
the horticultural sessions Tueedsy,when
A. uuarrenburg, a walnut grower
of Vancouver, presented the organiza
tion with a gavel made from the oldest
apple tree in the Northwest. Mr. Qaur
renburg in his presentation speech told
the story of the old tree, now 90 years
old. Still alive and bearing apples at
Vancouver barracks, it was planted by
one of the men of Capt. John Mc
Laughlin, governor for the Hudson
Bay Co.
The sessions of the Horticultural So
ciety came to a close yesterday. Ad
dresses were made on the last day by
the following: B.S.Johnson, A. H.
Harris, Robert Paulus, J. K. Magness,
A. C. Allen. J. T. Holt and A. B. I
Cordley.
