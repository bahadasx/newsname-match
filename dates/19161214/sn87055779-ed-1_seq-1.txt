Admits Decision Vas Reachedj
After Learning of the Pub
lic Demand For Such
investigation.
NO PUBLICITY WILL
BE GIVEN FINDINGS
Matter is to be Reported to
Health Department Thou
sand Homes in City
Will be Visited.
Tu answer to the popular appeal
for an adequate housing survey of
the city. Dr. Carroll Fox of th? fed
eral health elpeartment of Washing
ton, Wednesday announced his in
tention to devote a large amount of
i he time that he will spend in South
llend making a health survey to
the specific task of examining th
houses and homes in tho-e parts of
the city which are found to be the
disease centers.
The rurvey will follow along the
general lines of such a. survey that
has been mapped out by The News
Times in its campaign for a thor
uiiKh invesli gatior. of the living
( ond.iUon.s of thv people of the
city. No publicity, rmwever. will be
given to the work, which will he con
ducted by Ir. Fox with the assist
ance of the investigators in the
-m ploy of the health department.
That the resolution to make the
urvey of the "city did not follow
:nythiv2 that transpired in the
meeting of the civic committee of
the Chamber of Commerce, as cer
tain opinions have held. was the
statement of Dr. Fox Thursday
morning. He declared that his de
cision was made shortly after learn
ing of the popular demand for a
survey. He raid that he had sev--ra!
days ago given an order to a
local printer tor the blanks that are
to be used in the survey and that
they have been delayed.
To Yi-it l,Mo Home-.
Approximately 1,000 homes in
.-'outh Fend will be thoroughly ex
amined and tabulated, showing as
accurately as possible the condition
in the poorer sections and the sec
tions most afflicted with prevental.de
illness and death. "A housing survey
is always included in the govern
ment .health survey, such as I am
making 'n various cities of the
country." declared Ir. Fox. and
he went on to say that owing ti the
very urgent local demand, special
aitention would be paid in this city
tc the housing question.
"The correction of the evils that
shall he bared in the survey of the
housing condition. w ill be left in
the hands of the health department
of the city." said Dr. Fox. "My de
partment has no power to remedy
any condition that it may find. I
:;hal! gather the necessary :tatitics
and from them draw the conclusions
.!at they warrant and make the
recommendations that will be in
cluded in the report of the survey
of the city."
City Built Like Village.
"South Fend is a city built like a
village." said Dr. Fox. when asked
for a generalization of his findings
so far. He maintained, however,
that his experience in the city had
not been wide, since so far, his work
had confined him to the office of the
local health department. "South
P.end has thoe characteristics of the
village: the frame house, the privy
and the surface well. It has grown
and grown and no adequate provi
sion has teen made for the expan
sion. There Is a gre-at need here for
sewer connections and for water
t-onneetiems," said the official.
Among the other need of the city.
Dr. Fox was particular to mention
i,') increase in the numlt-r of visit
.vg nurses anil a larcer force in the
health department. He advanced the
theory that a better ed ication ,.f
li e people along the lines of san
itation, is a necessary adjunct of
an elective campaign for better liv
ing conditions and showed that the

it is probable that he will express

In political circles, hoveer, it ia

is as far as they go. None counsels
