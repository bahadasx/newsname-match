Mr. and Mrs. Roy Beck with of Al
llance, who were passengers on the
steamer Bear which went on the
beach off Hunr.boldt county Callfor
la, on June 14, 1916, may bo com
pelled to go to San Francisco within
the next few days to appear as wit
nesses In the federal court there.
Walter Vlllemayor, a member of
the Bear's crew, was arrested follow
ing the shipwreck and in his posses
sion were found articles of clothing
and personal property which be
longed to passengers. Among the
articles found were a Masonic charm
belonging to Mr. Beckwlth and sev
eral articles of clothing belonging to
Mrs. Beckwith.
Mr. Beckwith received a letter this
morning from John W. Preston,
United States district attorney at San
Francisco, statins that subpoenas
had been issued for he and Mrs. Beck
wlth as witnesses in the case of the
government upainst Vlllemayor.
The letter stated that it may only
be necessary for one of them to go.
They are hoping that matters will so
shape themselves that they will be
allowed to spend Christmas at their
home in Alliance instead of on the
coast.
COUNTY JAIL EMPTIED
OX SUNDAY NIGHT
The county Jail 'was emptied Sun
day night when Sheriff Cal Cox took
the two Mexicans who had robbed
box cars In the Burlington yards
here, and Livingston, the man of col
or, who was found guilty of. carrying
a revolver, to the state penitentiary.
Marshall of Heraingford. who drew
a year for wife desertion, was also
taken to Lincoln. '
Worthy Families Need Assistance .
Have You Clothing, Provisions
or Cash to Donate?
There is an opportunity for some
good fellow or some good fellows
here In Alliance to do a kindly act
here at home and right -now. Often
times when a collection is being tak
en for one purpose or another the
expression is heard, "Why don't they
start their charity here at home?"
Well. Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Ooodfel-
low, you have an opportunity and If
you have money for local work you
might step up and plank down tne
needed articles or some coin or, like
the preacher said, 'Forever hold
yovrt" peace." '
Nine Children In Family
Several Instances of need have
been brought to the attention of the
Herald. There la one family In Al
liance consisting of nine children,
ranging In age from three to sixteen
years, who could use some clothing
to great advantage. The father
works by the day. The mother is a
hard worker and capable and will
ing to make over clothing for the
children. "
Widow with Small Children
Another case that Is deserving of
help Is that of a widow who has to
support and care for a family of sev
eral children, two of whom are too
small to attend school.
Mother and Father 111
In another Instance sickness has
incapacitated the mother and father
of a family of eight children. The
cold weather and soaring prices
make It necessary to temporarily as
slst this family until health Is re
gained by the bread winners.
Too Proud to Ask Help
Here are three worthy families
who actually are In need of assist
ance. Here Is an opportunity for
some good fellow to do an act of
kindness that will be remembered
long after the act Is forgotten. These
people are people who have too much
self respect and pride to apply to the
City Mission for assistance, desiring
to, support the-x selves, but condi
tions are such that they must be
helped by friendly ministrations.
You May Help
The weather is cold and will get
colder. Food costs money and con
ciderable of It when It must be- pur
chased, for a large family. Howev
er, money is not the only need, by
any means. Sontrlr"ons of cloth
Ing, provisions or cs-. ::.n be used
to advantage and will be received by
the chairman of the Investigating
committee. Mrs. E. C. Drake. 313
Box Butte avenue. If It Is more
convenient for the donor the articles !
or cash may be left at the Herald of
fice to bo turned over to Mrs. Drake.
This Is an opportunity to do some
thing here at home. What have you
to offer?
EARLY MORXIXO FIRE
AT STURGEON HOME
An alarm was turned In from the
D. L. Sturgeon home, 412 Emerson,
about 2 o'clock Wednesday morning.
The fire department responded Im
mediately and continued to flht
with the fire about an hour. The
fire originated In the pantry and
compeltely destroyed the Boor of the
room, besides damaging the walls
considerably. The total dan-age will
probably be In tho neighborhood of
$100. The two small chemical tanks
and the big tank were all used to
quench the flr. Water was carried
In palls. The smoke was terrible,
nd retarded the work of putting out
the fire.
The fire department wis called to
he Baptist church Tuesday evening
about 6 o'clock, but the blaze was
out before th department arrived.
A box on top of the furnace had
caught fire.
FOOTBALL TEAM NOW V
ASSURED OF SWEATERS
The 1918" football squad of the
Alliance high school Is now assured
of sweaters In reward for their ef
fort during the football season. The
benefit show' held at the Imperial
theatre Monday night netted the
team the sum of $60, part of which
wes In the shape of a donation from
Manager Dubuque. The team sold
some $75 worth of tickets. It will
be necessary to purchase thirteen
sweaters, and It Is believed these can
he secured for rot to exceed J! 6 each
of a total of $78. Tho difference
between the $78 and the $60 will
probably be made up by the athletic
association, which Is now out of
debt for the first time in four years.

THE luYSTERY OF A

OUT IN OLD NEBRASKA
They talk of California,
Tlicy say the climate's grand,
They sing of old New Hampshire,
Also of "Dixie Land,"
They sing of dear old Georgia,
And of sunny Tennessee.
IH sing of old Nebraska,
It's good enough for me.
In Wisconsin there's the cyclone;
In Kansas there's the flood,
While down in old Missouri,
They wade kneo deep in mud.
In Texas there's the terror of
Submersion by the Rea,
In Nebraska we have neither
It's good enough for me.
The east coast has its hurricanes,
The west has its fogs,
The north is full of snow and ice,
The south has its bogs.
I've traveled Uncln Sam's domain
And some across the sea,
But life in old Nebraska
Is good enough for me.
Nebraska, where the cattle market
' Was never known to fail,
And when spuds all miss in other states,
We have plenty here for sale.
But for livin' in Nebraska,
My reasons they are three
There 's sunshine, health, and happiness.
That's why I'm living here. .

more to Alliance to have ''the' hew
building than it Is to the Sisters.

ou support a Christian Institution,"
said the dean. The dean viewed the
hospital from three different angles
that of a clergyT.an, that of a cit
izen and that of a graduato of the
uotfpital. "I am Intensely interested
n tho work ol any raan who shows
that he Is trying to do good," said
the dean. His talk waa followed by
