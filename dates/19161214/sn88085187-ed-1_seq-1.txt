GRIM, SIMPLE
TRAGEDY THIS
BY MABEL ABBOTT
It is a grim, simple tragedy that has been
unrolling itself in Judge Clifford's courtroom
this week-a story that Gorky or Turgenieff
might have written.
Just the story of a Russian-Po'ish immigrant
and his wife, like millions of others in all but
its ending.
The man, John Pierwsza, is an insignificant
figure as he sits behind his attorneys all day
long in the crowded courtroom, his stumpy
legs swinging clear of the fioor, his head
resting heavily on his hand, or craned for
ward to catch the meaning of the things that
are going on around him.
He has the broad face and high cheekbones of his race, pale
with the unhealthy pallor of the coal mine. His hands are muti
lated and the nails worn to the quick with a lifetime of toil.
The habit of obedience shows itself in every motion, and there
is a sort of a dumb, animal-like endurance in the very set of his
shoulders.
John Pierwsza was only 26 years old when he came to Ameri
ca. He had served four years in the Russian army before he
came.
He had courage and initiative, for he did not settle down to
the dull, hopeless life of the peasant, but struck out in the bold
hopefulness of youth for a free country.
He was married. He left his wife behind, to wait until he
could send for her.
His first job in the new world was "in a tunnel, under the
water," in New York—the hard, dangerous work that he and his
kind do for the country to which they come.
When he had saved money enough, he sent a ticket back to the
old country, and his wife joined him. They lived in New York
for some time; and then he came west, leaving her to wait again
until he should find work.
He found it in the little mining towns of Washington. In
Carbonado he sent for her again, and she came. Later they went
to Wilkeson.
He could neither read nor write. She could not even count
beyond the first seven numerals. Neither of them ever learned
to speak well the language of the new country. But they worked
hard, and he had a certain shrewdness, and by and by they owned
their home—a house with a parlor and a bedroom and a dining
room with portieres, and a kitchen with a fine range, and a sep
arate summer kitchen. They owned other property, too.
