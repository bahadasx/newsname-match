S ORDERED SHOT
ELEASED
(By Associated Press.)
EL PASO, Dec. 15. An
American arriving from San
ta Rosalia, confirmed the kill
ing of Howard Gray at Par
ral and Dr. Fisher at Santa
Rosalia; also an unknown
Irishman at Jiminez.
He said that .Mexican wo
men begged Villa to spare the
life of Fisher, who was an
aged physician and had been
there for many years. Fisher
unhesitatingly told Villa that
he was an American, where
upon he was taken to the cem
etary and executed. His head
was cut off.
An unknown American,
taken from the train at Jim
inez was similarly treated, de
spite the united protests of
British subjects.
Henry Clark, an American
at Jiminez, was stripped na
ked and ordered shot, but wss
released when his son offeree
to join Villa's army if pardon
was granted to his father.

CARDIFF, Wales., Dec.
15. After a year of compar
ative peace, labor and capi
tal are again at loggerheads
in the. South Wales coal
fields. For nearly a genera
tion the colliery owners and
the miners have maintained
an attitude of mutual ill-temper
and superstition, and war
has not been allowed to dis
place their traditional quar
rel. A year ago a five day
stoppage of the mines, on
which the British navy large
ly depends for fuel, actually
took place, and a prolonged
deadlock was only averted
by the intervention of Lloyd
George, who summarily
granted most of the miners'
demands over the protests of
the owners.
The demands now made by
the miners may be summar
ized as follows :
Immediate concession of a 15 per
cent advance in wages to cover the
increased cost of living.
An independent audit of the coal
owners' .books to show exactly what
are the profits on all classes of coal
over a long period of years.
That the finanoial relation of wages

BISHOP LEONARD
HEADS TRUSTEES
UNIV. OF SOUTH.
CALIFORNIA
(Special to Yuma Daily Examiner.)
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15. The Uni
versity of Southern California, at Los
Angeles, has announced the election
of Bishop Adna Wright Leonard, L.L.
D., to the position of president of the
board of trustees. Bishop Leonard
is one of the youngest and most ac
tive bishops of the Methodist Episco
pal Church. His diocese includes Cal
ifornia, Nevada and Arizona, and his
official residence is in San Francisco.
He announced his acceptance of the
post at the University last week.
Bishop Leonard will succeed Dr. E.
A. Healy, dean of the Maclay College
of Theology in flie university, who has
filled the post of president of the trus-
I tees for several years,
j "I feel that we are extremely fortu
; nate in securing so able a man as
Bishop Leonard for this important po-
sition," said Dr. Bova'rd, in comment
ing on the election.
"Bishop Leonard is keenly inter
ested in educational work, and un
derstands it thoroughly. Even before
his' elevation to the episcopacy last
May, he expressed his keen interest
jn our institution and his wish to be
of service to us. Already he is work
ing with us on ambitious plans for
the welfare of the university."
GREECE ACCEPTS
ALLIED ULTIMATUM
(By Associated Press.)
LONDON, Dec. 15. The
Greeks have accepted the al
lied ultimatum, according to
a Central News dispatch to
day. LILL
to profits be ultimately arranged so
that the percentage shall be the same
as before the war.
Payment to be made for "small coal"
henceforth on a tonnage rate to be
established by later negotiations.
That the selling price of coal be
henceforth established by a competent
authority on a basis of the standard
wage paid.
It is evident from this complicated
and elaborateseries of demands, that
a settlement must necessarily involve
protracted negotiations. The miners
contend that the 15 per cent wage in
crease is urged and should be granted
at once; the other demands may be
taken up more leisurely before any
suitable tribunal.
One of the most puzzling of the de
mands is that which seeks payment
for the so-called "small :oal." This,
is a new demand, and meets with de
termined opposition from the. owners.
Hitherto the workmen who refused
payment on a tonnage basis so much
for every ton of coal mined have
been paid only for large or first qual
ity coal. Every ton of coal which the
miner sent to the surface was first
passed over the screen and only the
residue after the small coal had been
screened out, was weighed and paid
for.
While feeling in the coal regions is
at high pitch, the attitude of the coun
try at large is one of undisguised
impatience with any quarrel between
capital and labor at a time when the
energies of the country are so largely
concentrated on war.
DEATH BLOW AIMED
BUSINESS BY HOUSE
(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.
The house postoffice com
mittee today favorably re
ported a bill prohibiting the
mailing of liquor advertise
ments to any except licensed
liquor dealers or agents. This
legislation is aimed at the
mail order liquor business in
dry territory.
The federal mails are being
used to trasmit liquor adver
tising and solicitation of or
ders to millions of men, wom
eng and hildren, many of them
residing in states which have
outlawed the liquor traffic
and many of them resident
in homes where conscientious
conviction classes the traffic
in liquor with the traffic in
vice, the practice of thievery
and the most loathesome
forms of industrial parasit
ism. Advertising and solicita
tion so transmitted is intend
ed to create a demand for -alcoholic
liquors where such
demand did not previously
exist, to provoke the appetite
where existent, and to under
mine the American prejudice
against the table use of such
drugged drinks. By the com
pulsion of suggestion, it con
verts the abstainers into
drinkers striving to cease the
habit. This is admittedly an
evil to the citizen and a men
ace to the social welfare.
By the use of the mails
this suggestive force is being
brought to bear upon the ab
stinent classes of American
society in order that they may
contribute drinkers to the pa
tronage of the liquor trade.

Propably no further devel
opments will be announced
until Lloyd George's appear
ance in the commons on Tues
day. In the meantime Berlin
announced the capture of Bu
zeu, implying possible serious
consequences to the Ruma
nians who were expected to
make a stand along the Bu
zeu river on the southern
Moldavian border and possib
ly it may involve the whole
Russo-Rumanian line. Mili
tary commentators consider
ed it essential that the Rus
sians hold this line to protect
the Carpathian front.

A well known whisky is ad-j
vertised as follows: "For All

Mida's Criterion of the
Wine and Spirit Interests
says: "Thousands of dollars
are spent each year during
the hot months in an effort to
get the public to use grape
juice, pineapple juice and
other fruit juices in cold pun
ches. Why not advertise
wine as a summer drink?
Many a family that does not
today use a drop of wine
could be taught by attractive
copy, illustrated with tempt
ing colored drawings, to use
our light red and white wines
in punches and lemonades."
One mail order whisky
house tried to sell its lists to
the Keeley Company., saying,
"Our customers are your fu
ture patients."
A law excluding liquor ad
vertising and solicitation
from the mails would be in ac
cordance with the precedent
which has excluded obscene
publications, lottery tickers,
shipments of liquor and con
traceptive devices. The gov
ernment already imposes re
strictions which are based up-j
on recognition of the peculiar"
character and tendencies or
the trade and this additional
restriction would be a logical
development of policy, uni
form in its operation and just
to the various classes of citi
zenship. BIG CORN INCREASE;

NEW YORK, Dec. 15. "I

John N. Willys of Toledo, O.,
president of the Willys-Overland
Company, at the second
day's session of the tenth an

Presidents.
"I think we are just start
ed," said Mr. Willys. "We
have long had natural resour
ces. The war has awakened
us to their more efficient de
velopment. Europe must be
rebuilt after this war ends.
We will have the trained men
as never before. It will be
our work. The profits will
be ours. There is - warrant
for optimism. But if we are
to realize our commercial ul
timate, there must be a mini
mum curbing of individual
aggressiveness. The amaz
ing advance of the motor car
industry proves what Ameri
can men can do if left a free
hand. . j

DRASTIC CAR CHARGES
s
(By Associated Piss.-)
WASHINGTON, Dec, 15.
Drastic demurrage charges
are effective today as an em
ergency measure remedy for
the car shortage, which has
impeded commerce and con
tributed greatly to the high
cost of living. Consignees will
get two days to unload, then
will be charged a dollar the
first days' demurrage, two for
the second, and three for the
third and then five for each
succeeding day.
EFFICIENCY
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
ember 1, 1916, saw 3,352,000 cars, rep
resenting an approximate cash value
of two billion dollars. Think of the
growth from 120,000 to 3,352,000 cars
in one decade. The founders of Uie
industry had optimism. Optimism has
reaped its - rewards. Look at the
changes the motor car has wrought in
our daily life. It has bettered it in
every factor, urban and rural, social
and commercial.
"There is no greater error in our
national life than failure justly to ap
praise the patriotism of the American
merchant, manufacturer and financier.
I genuinely believe that the hope of
our country lies in the efficiency that
we have developed in so-called 'Big
Business,' and in the patriotic willing
ness of the men who control this effi
ciency devote its full power to the
safeguarding of the nation. Indus
trial efficiency in this country goes far
beyond governmental efficiency. This
can be said without any lack of patriot
ism. The very nature of our institu
tions, the working out of our democ
racy, precludes in governments meth
ods that permanency so essential to
utmost efficiency.
"There are those who concede this
superior commercial efficiency, but
who condemn it as being applied to
purely personal ends. They argue
that the industrial chieftain has an
eye only for the dollar, that he is blind
to larger considerations of abstract
patriotism. Gentlemen, this is an in
justice that cannot too ardently be re
