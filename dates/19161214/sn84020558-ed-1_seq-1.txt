DEPORTING BELGIANS
TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
(Republican A. P. Leased Wire
I IKK UN. Dec. 13. (Uy wireless to
Suyville) Germany's reply to the In
quiries of the United states into the
matter of Belgian nnemployeil and the
deportation of Belgians is published to
day in the Norddoutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung, and is (riven out by the Over
seas News agency follows:
"The government of the United States
of America has protested against the
transportation of Belgian workingmen
to Germany and against their comisil
sory employment for work, basing this
on the view that these measures are
in contravention of humane principles
and of international practice as to the
treatment of the population in occu
pied territory. The German govern
ment thinks that the government of
the United States has been incorrectly
informed regarding the cause and the
execution of the measures, and there
fore considers it appropriate first to
explain the facts in detail.
'in Belgium unemployment for a
considerable time has been extending
in a perplexing fashion among the in
dustrial workingmen. This prevalence
of unemployment has been caused bv
the Knglish policy of isolation which
has cut off Belgian industry from the
importation of raw material and the
vxportation of manufactured goods and
has thus brought the greater part of
Uelgian industry to a standstill.
"By this measure almost half of the
workingmen in Belgian factories, num
bering altogether in round figures.
l.l'vo.OuO. were deprived of the possibtlty
of earning a living, and many more
than half a million Belgians, who form
erly supiiorted themselves by industrial
work, were made dependent upon public
relief. Adding the members of their
families, this number Is increased three
fold or in round figures, one million
and a half persons.
"From the standpoint of Belgian eco
nomic right, upon which these unem
ployed inflict a heavy burden, as also
from the standpoint of public order
and public morals which are most
dangerously affected by general un
employment and the accompanying
consequences, this situation makes it
extremely desirable and urgent that
efficient measures for improvement' lie
laxen.
"This necessity has been-recognized
and pointed out ulso fair minded
.Belgians for a long time.
' r.elgian Industries being in a de
pressed condition, it was tmoostible to
procure for all the unemployed work,
r at least proiier employment, with
in Belgium itself. The only thing possi
ble, therefore, was to assiirn tliern to
work in Germany, where a large num
l?r of Belgian workingmen had alreudv
voluntarily accepted work, were vvefl
fed. were receiving high wases. -ind
were enjoying far reaching liberty of
movement. For ih jso . w orking men,
however, that did not support their
families, coercive labor was used.

NEW YORK. Dec. 13 Troubles of

mittee here today by Luton Horton,
president of one of the largest distrib

plained that:
"Many persons use milk drivers a
alarm clocks.
"Fine, fashionable people who rent

and leave for Florida in the spring al
so leave their milk "bills behind.
"A mill; driver climbs on an average
of 324 flights of stairs a day and twice
a week this is doubled because of t lit
bills he has to deliver."
"No man can climb that number of
stairs and last more than. three years."
he said.
"Referring to t lie "fine, fashionable
people," who go away without paying
their milk bills, Mr. Horton said it was
often necessary to follow them to the
co ntrv and "dun" them.
"I tell my boys," he added, "to fol
low them to the grave."

and action. The discussion between!
the advocates of these two opinions
vvas some time very animated. This
discussion vvas reopened by the dis
patch in question. The parties and

America was observing strict neutrali
ty accented the dispatch as confirma
tion of their opinion and to the others
came as a fchock.
"In order to understand this effect,
one has only to recall the large num
ber of facts which have been before
the eyes of the German public during
the last few years. Kngland has re
peatedly announced that all Knglish
ships ought to be ready to destroy
German submarines wherever they find
them. This has l-en publicly pro
claimed, as well by private as by of
ficial persons in Kngland. (Juite re

every Knelish born captain a prize of

SENATE REFUSES
TRepubllcan A. P. Leases Wire
WASHINGTON. L"ec. 13. Final ac
tion on the immigration bill w:us de
terred by the senate tonight to permit
committee considt ration of an amend
ment proposed bv Senator 1.R Follette
to eliminate language excluding per
sons who advocate or teach destruc
tion of property. A vote on the passage
of the bill probably will be reached to
morrow. Senator La Foilette contended that
there were other sufficient bars against
anarchists, and that the provision to
w hich he objected would shut the doors
of the United States to worthy men
from other lands because destruction
of property had been incidental to u
revolution in which they were not con
cerned. Other senators opposed elim
inating the provision entirely, and it
was decided to send trie amendment to
the committee.
Another day was devoted to the bill
by the senate, most of the debate cen
tering on amendments suggested to tile
literacy test provision, the exclusion of
Asiatics, and the right of -isyl -m for
the persecuted.
A provision which would have for
Kibe and llollatidia. They were all at
tacked by enemy submarines with
artillery or torpedoes without tho
shadow of a warning.
"These facts, of course, justify the
suspicion that among other German
steamers which are simply overdue or
have not returned several met their
end in the same fashion. In one case,
that of the steamer Kolga, we know it.
from survivors. In this case seven
lives were lost and the survivors de
clared that a British submarine calm
ly steered around the sinking ship
without even stirring a hand towards
rescue. 1 merely refer to this in order
to explain the feeling of the German
population.
"Germany, on the other hand, haw
promised the United States to carry on
submarine warfare according to tin
international rules of cruiser warfare.
Dr. Zimmermann at this moment in
terrupted his conversation, walked
through his office, stopiied and in tho
face of the interviewer said to his
clerk in an energetic manner:
This promise will have to be kept,''
then he continued:
"The orders to the commanders of
our submarines are clear and strict in
this direction. I can affirm with abso
lute certainty that no German subma
rine has intentionally attacked a mer
chant ship without warning and with
out giving all on biiard amide time ami
opportunity for rescue. You will have
read a report about a submarine that
found dnwng stormy weather a steam
er near the Spanish coast, which it vvas
entitled to sink, and waited manv
hours patiently because the weather
made it impossible to rescue those on
board. You will recall other German
submarines taking the crews of tor
pedoed steamers on board until the
sea was smooth and a passing stop
could take them over."
Dr. Zimmermann paced up and down
in his office and repeated:
"These are the facts of the case. We
are animated by the best feelings to
ward everybody. But we are fighting
for the life and future of our nation.
Kverybody can understand that at such
a moment as this, German public opin
ion analyzes very carefully the facts
and compares our attitude w ith thai of
the enemy, of course we are cut off
from the greater part of the columns
of the outer world, especially wilii t!i"
United Stales. . ( iur enemies use the
cables, tile mails and the spoken wo: 1
in order to plead heir cause before
the world. But other nations ought to
hear our voice, our grievances. I, niv
self with these vvorda, only mean to ex
plain the reasons for the present popu
lar feeling in Germany and feel suro
that it will be appreciated everywhere
by all fair minded people.
"The situation is that Germany and
her allies are surrounded by enemies:
and that Germany has victoriously
carried the war on all fronts beyond
the limits of Germany. Popular iei
ing in Germany is that our enemies,
unable to win victory on the battle
fields, will try to win by creating a
strong impression about Germany's in
tention and Germany's actions in tin'
rest of the world where Germany's
voice can only seldom be heard.
"Thev will try to persuade the world
that in the cae of submarines and m
other cases Germany will disregard
her given word, while they themselves,
in fact, have abrogated the laws of ra
tions and do themselves what they
charge against us. as in the case of
hostile submarines attacking German
vessels and in attack on neutrais. at
in the case of Greece.
"But this respect for truth and jus
tice cannot be suppressed forever. We
are confident in our future military op
erations and are eipiallv confident that
the justice of our cause w ill- triumph
in the mind of the world."
