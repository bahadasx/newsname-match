THE TIGERS ARE HONORED
"FOR GREAT ATHLETIC YEAR
" 3 The Missouri spirit, which has been
the object of admiration and favora
ble comment throughout the West,
last night crjstallized into tributes
and oratory at the banquet given by
the citizens of Columbia to the 1916
Tigers, Missouri Valley Champions,
and Bob Simpson, the world's best
athlete, at Rothwell Gymnasium. Each
member of the "great" eleven came In
for individual mention., and the team
as a whole was given its share oil
credit and spoils. Bob Simpson was
heaped with verbal flowers by each
of the evening's speakers. Approxi
mately 175 persons were seated around
the big Mutable.
"For seven years banquets have al
ways followed Tiger victories' over
Kansas'," E. Sidney Stephens, toast-
master, said in opening the even
ing's program, "This year we are not
only celebrating a Tiger football vic
tory, but one of the most remarkable
athletic years which this or any other
university,can boast of. We have had
two Missouri' Valley championships,
football and track, a tie for the
championship in baseball, and the best
basketball season Missouri has ever
had."
Mr. Stephens thanked the commit
tee in charge of the banquet, their as
sistants, the attendants, and the. wom
en who prepared the banquet He
then introduced President A. Ross
Hill, who spoke on "The University
and Athletics."
Missouri Department HodeL
"Athletics as as much an integral
department of the University as any of
our departments, of the various
schools," President Hill declared.
"Missouri was 'the leader in making
it such in the institutions of the West
and Middle West, and our athletic de
partment is one of the models of its
kind for the entire country. Athletics
have their educational features and
inter-collegiate competition is an out
ward indication to the puhlio of the
strength of the school. The public is
of the opinion that an institution
which is weak in athletic attainments
is also weak in its other work and
justly so.
"The clean manly fighting spirit
which is displayed upon the athletic
field is the same spirit which Induces
many men to solve the intellectual
problems and attend Institutions of
higher education. The teamwork of
the Tigers in the Kansas game was
indicative of the teamwork and co
operation which is characteristic of
the University of Missouri in its ev
ery department
"I could not single out any indi
vidual player as the star of the Kansas
game. What Kansas games means to
the people of Missouri and the alumni
is well illustrated by the spirit of the
Kansas City alumni and the loyalty
which brought a car filled, with peo
ple from Harrisonville to see Panl
Hamilton play."
"Simpson An Ideal Athlete."
In concluding. President Hill char
acterized Bob Simpson as the great
est athlete in any university in the
world. His Impression of Simpson
was that of the incarnation of an
ideal Greek athlete of the ancient pe
riod.
Introduced as one of the prime
movers in the reformation of intercol-

ley Conference."
The reformation of the ataletie situ
ation in the Valley-has brouaMrt-iet-ter
coaches, who are now mfirtjri of
the teaching staff of the dHtcr'tnt in
stitutions, better managers, and a bet
ter relationship between the schools
coming out of the semi-annual meet
tags of the conference delegates at
the various institutions, Doctor Manly
asserted. The feeling of friendly riv
alry had surplanted bitter hatred, and
I a-' realization that one scnlwas as
honest as another had been brought
about, he declared.
Illustrating this. Doctor Manly re
lated a story of a Valley coach who,
being unable to attend a dual track
meet, telegraphed the rival coach to
take care of his men. And the rival
coach did to the best.qf his ability.
'The Squarest Xan In th Valley."
"The squarest man, in the Missouri
Valley," was the Introduction given C.
L. Brewer, director of athletics, by the
toastmaster.
Mr. Brewer announced that a friend
of Missouri athletics had offered a
cup to be given each year to the sen
ior M man in any major sport who
had the highest scholastic standing.
The only requirement being that the
man must have been a student in the
University for at least three years. Mr.
Brewer's subject was "Missouri Ath
letics Up to Date,"
"Athletics at Missouri and in the
Valley," Mr. Brewer said, "may be di
vided into three enochs. The first
epoch is that of the days of the '0s
before the time'of, eligibility rnles and
scholastic, conditions. It was the
time of the pld 'flying wedge when
football was a personal combat be
tween each of the eleven men .of the
opposing teams. In the second epoch,
beginning wjth.1900, came the wave of
reform There was a movement on
root to abolish intercollegiate ath
letics and it was only through stiff
opposition that it lived through the
period. It was the first period of
eligibility rules and legislation. Mis
souri was the leader in the reform
movement in the West The third
epoch begins about 1906 and is char
acterized by clean, manly college
sports.
"Xissouri Has the Punch."
"A friend of mine who was for a
short time a coach here said that the
only thing Missouri lacked in his day
was the punch. Missouri now haa a
punch greater than any of the insti
tutions of the Valley or of the West
The record of the teams is indicative
of this. Bob's records in the last
two years have done more for the
University of Missouri than whipping
Kansas for 100 years could do. He
has not only given the school 'national
but international fame. The best
thing about it is that after his foreign
invasion, he came back to us the same
modest and unassuming boy and the
same Missourlan that he was when
he entered this institution as a fresh
man. . .
"Missouri athletes are the finest
type of boys. We have here forty

Dealer Says That Prices Are
High and Shipments
Hard to Get.
10,000 BUSHELS A WEEK
""v
Mines in County Lower Cost,
'but Supply Wouldn't
Last Three Days.
"The future "of the coalUltuation in
Columbia does sot look encouraging,"
Fred A. Dalton told tne Commercial
Club at its regular weekly luncheon
today,
HAG
I don't want to be aaIar-,
1st
he 8atd"M4r!'we are hoping for
the best, but 7 really do nof fcnowlow
we are going to supply the city the
rest of the winter. ,
"The situatioa.ia, far frqnvBtifac
tory to both'thejdealer anaMhe con-
sumer. The price' is kigherthan for
merly; coal is hard tVgef&nd deal
ers are two weeks behind in their. or
ders. This does not mean that if a.
person orders a ton of coal he will
have to wait! two weeks before he gets.
It If 'he is out, he will get a load,,
at once, but only a load or two is sent . t
to each place! A peron wh orders ,,
his basement "filled' may get only one
load." ,,
Gives Reasons of Operators.
Mr. Dalton said he did not know
why prices were high, but that he
could give the reasons given by the
mine operators. Operators say that,
owing to the prosperity of the coun
try, industries and railroads are con
suming more coal than usual; there
Is a shortage of cars, and the south
western miners were on a strike until
late in- the season. Contrary to' for
mer years, Illinois is called upon to
ship coal east.
Most of Columbia's coal comes from
Illinois, according to Mr. Dalton. It
is the custom here for, the dealer to
contract with- the sarators 'to; the
winter's-supply andtaen to contract
with the large consumers for their
supply for the winter months. When
the price of coal advanced about 2
a ton at the mines, the operator began
a policy of giving the dealer as small
an amount at a time as possible. One
example was given by Mr. Dalton In
which the mining company leased the
mine and repudiated the contract with
the local dealer. The price to the
dealer from the new operator was $1.
50 higher. This forces the dealer to
go on the market and buy from the
jobber, from whom the price is from
$1 to $3 higher.
Affiles rte're Keep Prices J)wm."
" Coal is much cheaper here 1 than in
the surrounding' towns. Mr. Dalton
thinks this iU due to the mines in the
county. Although the local mines
serve to lower the price here, ' the
speaker said that the town would
freere in three days if it depended en
tirely upon the local supply. Lack of
labor, transportation and capital keeps
the output of Boone 'County's mines
I low. "I, don't see how we cah great
ly Increase the output in this county,"
Mr. Dalton said.
Columbia uses about ten thousand
bushels of coal a day, in the six win
ter months according r'td estimates
gathered by 'Mr. Dalton. Thirteen
hundred cars, about l,462,500bushels,
of coal were shipped into Columbia
last year. The University nses about
two cars a day during the cold weather.
1
Christian College uses from eight to
ten tons'' a day. It is estimated that
the schools born from twenty to
twenty-live thousand bushels every
twenty-four hours. These are only a
fewer the big consumers of fuel in
the city.
Urges Federal AM on KoM.
Dr. J. B. Cole spoke briefly about
roads. He said that Columbia ought
to do something- to help pass a daw
which would permit Missouri to get
federal money to build road. Missouri
cannot get money from federal' funds
now, as other states can. because the
proper organizations is not In force to
make use of the funds. Doctor Cole
said that MIneola Hills question has
been solved. He advocated using con
vict labor on the Old- Trails Road.

Dorsey Blackburn of Boone County
has filed salt in the Circuit Court to
divorce his wife, Mrs. LUlie Black
burn. Blackburn charges his wife
with desertion and other lndignites.
