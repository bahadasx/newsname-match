L-nnf... fcv T ii r 13. Tho state cor-
linrlltiilll en mmisslon today heard the
traffic representatives of New Mexico
inroads on the proposition to es
tablish a three cent per mile passen
ger rate on intrastate traffic. Argu
ments were presented by i.enerni
Passenger Traffic Manager F . A.
Wadlcich of the Denver ami Kio
(ininile, General Passenger Agent J.
XI. Connell of the Santa Fe, and the
other railroad representatives, all
tending to show that to enforce a
three-rent rate would be confiscation
and would be asking the railroads to
haul passengers nt less than cost.
The Santa Fe, the most prosperous
of the transcontinental lines repre
lentcd, showed by Its figures that
even t the present passenger rates
(hp return is less than four per cent.
The density of Intrastate travel In
Xew Mexico per year is only 15,165
as against 42.398 in Texas, 51.758 In
Kansas'. 55.842 In Colorado, 99,895 in
California. During the year ending
June 30. the Santa Fe carried only
eight intrastate passengers to each
train, eight passengers in or outbound

ndvnnce In the pav of employes, the
Santa Fe has paid out in wages
138,000,000 more in New Mexico from
1907 to the present, than as if the
1907 scale had remained into effect
until the present. The taxes paid In
New Mexico hy the Santa 1' e nave
increased from $289,000 in 1908 to
t.;-r, ru.ii mix. The annual cost to
the company from federal and state
regulations and orders affecting rail
road operations ran up to $1,128,310
In 1914, and Is constantly increasing.
Demands for better and Increased
passenger service must be met. The
number of "passengers handled per
train or per car has not increased,
and yet the cost per passanger and
mail train mile has increased from
cents In 1908 to $1.05 this year.
The number, of passengers carried
per train mile was 56 in 1908, while
(even years later it was only 54. The
'(inclusion drawn is "that the present
Intrastate passenger rates are too low
viewed both from the cost and the
density standpoint, and that In all
fairness there should be an increase
in rates in common with increases in
other commodities and in thr --ligations
where similar conditions are
found."

The cost for operating expenses and
taxes per passenger mile for New Mex
ico Intrastate business under this
analysis is 3.16 cents for 1915 and 3. OS
cents for $1916, without uny allow
ance for return upon Investment. If
to this cost Is added a 7 per cent re
turn upon the proportion of the as
sessed value assignable to the Intra-
1 state passenger business the full cost
I of hauling an intrastate passenger one
'mile in the state of New Mexico would
be 4.6 8 cents for 1915 and 4.30 cents
for 1916. The actual average revenue
per passenger mile under the 4 cent
rate in the slate of New Mexico was
3.911 cents for the year ending June
30, 1915, and 3.598 cents for 1916.

In support of this analysis it is de
sired to call attention to an analysis
made of the passenger traffic over the
lines of this company between Clovis
and Helen, during tho period January
9 to April 8, 1914, ihi luslve. It was
found that the two passenger trains
operated on the line between Carlsbad
and Clovis during this period handled
an average of 24.3 passengers per
train mile with an actual revenue of
80 cents per passenger train mile, or
3.3 cents per passenger mile. The op
erating expenses per pussenger train
mile without any allowance for taxes,
rentals or return upon Investment for
this line in 1914 was $1.02; excluding
expenses assignable to mall and ex
press, It was approximately 81 cents,
os a cost per passenger mile of 2.3
cents exclusive of any return upon In
vestment. The full cost per mile on
this line, including a return upon in-
' vestment, would approximate 5 cents,
! whereas as an earning only 3.2 cents.
The cost per train mile on this lino the German chancellor nefore the
