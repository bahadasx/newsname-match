Uproots Orchard
To Plant Wheat
A number of acres of orchard land
'across Bear creek are being convert
ed Into wheat land under the gentle
encouragement of a tractor engine.
The orchard, which was not a success
mainly owing to lack of water, Is
being pulled up and the wood saved.
It will be planted to wheat.
Twenty acres are on the old Waite
tract, an orchard planted by Pennsyl
vania people. The land has been
leased by MosBrs. Hodgson and Hali
baugh and Davis. The other twelve
acres Is on the Jim McCracken place
near the D. M. Lowe experiment
farm. The tractor .was rigged to pull
two rows at a time. The wood is
being salvaged.
Struble Impresses
Sanitarium Need
"Somebody has been using extra
quality brain work In the conception
and development of Ashland's beau
tiful Lithla park," said Wallace R.
Rtruble of Portland, former secretary
of the Astoria, Oregon, Commercial
Club, and well-known, all-round pub
licity expert, yesterday. "I assume
that I have an ounce of gray matter
in my 'bean' and can detect the pres
ence and operation of this substance
In visible results such as are appar
ent in Lithla park. Nowhere In my
travels on this continent have I seen
anything to surpass and, very little to
equal the harmonizing of nature and
art which has been accomplished at
Ashland. It would almost seem that
Inspiration had taken a direct hand
in the work of your citizens; certain
ly there has been vision on the part
of somebody.
Reminded of Red Oak.
"The thoughtful provisions for the
comfort of visitors and campers evi
dent in the equipment of the park
reminds me forcefully of the hospita
ble attributes of the citizens of Red
Oak, Iowa, the place which the trav
eler ever longs to revisit. Ashland
has only to follow up the program so
well begun In its Lithla park and
other improvements to make Its pros
perous future an assured fact.
Sanitarium a Sequence.
"The construction of a modern san
itarium adjacent to the park, having
the benefit of its matchless natural
attractions and your wonderful min
eral waters, would seem to be a logi
cal sequence of the foundation so
well laid; Such a sanitarium, prop
erly constructed and managed, would
be an invaluable tourist asset and
Would assure your city uniform
growth, prosperity and development.
I take it for granted that Ashlanders
are alive to their opportunity In this
respect and prepared to act as a unit
to further such an enterprise. i
The Tourist Asset.
"No single factor of community de
velopment can compare In quickness,
cleanness and profitableness with the
tourist invasion. . It brings bright,
brainy, prosperous spenders right
into your midst, and every bank, ho
tel, store and business enterprise of
whatever sort feels the Immediate
quickening impulse. It links your
city In unbreakable bonds with rail
way and automobile traffic, and puts

Historic Store
Soon to Close Doors
Beebe & Kinney's store, one of the
historic business establishments of
Ashland, is to close its doors in a few
days. Away back in the '80s this
store was McCall & Mills, the original
owners and both Ashland pioneers.
Then Vaupelj Norrls & Drake became
owners of the store. Mr. Kinney then
replaced Mr. Norrls, then Mr. Beebe
replaced Mr. Drake, and as the final
change Mr. Vaupcl sold out, leaving
the business in the hands of Beebe
and Kinney.
During the tremendous closing out
sale which has been carried on un
der the direction of J. S. Langhorne,
merchandise has been sold for an
average of more thin six dollars to
each man, woman and child in Ash
land. Over 3,000 pairs of sfcoes have
been sold, more than 100,000 yards
of piece goods, giving some idea of
the monster Btock which Beebe &
Kinney carried to accommodate the
every need of their customers.
During the managership of Messrs.
Beebe and Kinney the stare has had
Its most successful years. These gen
tlemen havo now decided to retire
from the business, having other in
terests in the valley. Saturday Is to
be the biggest price slashing day of
the sale. It is the intention if possi
ble to sell out everything in the store.
New Siskiyou Town
Is Flourishing
Grenada, the new townsite in
northern California, Is flourishing.
It is expected that the new hotel
at Grenada will be ready to open
some time this month. The building
is now well along toward completion
and one can get a fair idea of what
the structure will be when finally
opened. It will be strictly modern
in every particular.
Material for eight new bungalows
has been distributed at various points
about the townsite and work on the
new 40xl00-foot warehouse along
the Southern Pacific track is making
good progress.
The Southern Pacific Company
has a crew of men at work laying a
new siding and men are also at work
digging trenches for water mains and
sewers.

IMner Back From
Overland Factory
G. E. Milner has returned from the
convention of Overland automobile
dealers held in Toledo, Ohio. Mr.
Millner reports a most satisfactory
trip from every standpoint. The fac
tory, which is said to be the largest
in the country, was visited and the
making of the cars explained to the
thousands of dealers. He estimates
that by the time the convention,
which extends from the 1st to the
23rd, is over, fully 20,000 people will
have attended it. Oregon sent 120,
California 115 and Washington 60.
The Overland company paid all the
expenses of the trip, which amounted
to nearly $1,500,000. The conven
tion is to become an annual event.
From an estimate made during the
first five days, it is thought that dur
ing the time of the convention orders
amounting to $125,000,000 will be
taken.
The Big Day to Be Saturday
Enormous Crowd to
Be Cared For
Hundreds and. hundreds of people
have been waiting for the one big
day of the Beebe & Kinney sale. It
is a well-known fact now that the big
store Is actually going out of busi
ness. The day is set and the time
draws near. People have been wait
ing for the day when prices would
be marked down to the lowest limit.
Mr. Langhorne, who has managed
the closing out of this Btock, has des
ignated Saturday, December 16, as
the day on which to give the people
of Ashland and vicinity the most re
markable marked-down sale it has
been their pleasure to see.
The Beebe & Kinney sale has been
a most wonderful one in many re
spects. One good thing about it has
been that it has saved thousands of
dollars for the people who have pat
ronized the store. Prices on all mer
chandise have been steadily advanc
ing, and they have been greatly re
ducing their prices.
Had it not been for this sale the
buying public would have had to pay
much higher prices for all kinds of
needed merchandise.
The store will open promptly at
9:65 a. m. and the large sales force
will be ready to serve the large
crowd sure to be present In order to
secure their share of the wonderful
bargains to be offered. '

Judge Watson Does
Us All a Favor
Judge Watson dropped In on us
yesterday and Inquired, "Can I do
anything for you today?"
"For the love of the board of
health, drive out this fog," says we.
"Well, I'm a little busy this after
noon," returned the judge, "but I'll
attend to it the first thing In the
morning."
And .the Judge must have arisen
early, for the sun shone brightly for
the first time In several days this
morning and the cold fog which has
hung like a blanket over the valley
and kept everything frozen and snow
unmelted on the ground, had been
crowded down Into the lower valley
where It hangs like a pall over Mod
ford. A queer and yet natural state of
affairs is noted in that while the
streets and yards in Ashland still
have considerable snow upon tliem,
the hills of Grizzly across Bear creek j
are bare almost to the sumn.'t. The
reason lies in the fact innt the fog j
hung only about two hundred feet I
deep and above that the sun has been
shining brightly and warmly for sev
eral days.
Wire Theft Gets
Young Man In Bad
Howard Dunlop, a local young
man, has been bound over to tho
grand jury and announcements of ar
rests are expected as the result of
the alleged theft of 1,400 pounds of
copper wire which was strung to the
power house at Lamb's mine, five
miles south of here. The mine has
not been In operation fo some time
past and the theft was not discovered
until Mr. Lamb visited the mine re
cently on an inspection trip.
Weed Lumber Camps
Close for the Winter
Owing to severe weather and snow
fall, the logging camps of the Weed
Lumber Company, located, on the
Klamath Falls branch of the South
ern Pacific Company, will cease oper
ations the latter part of the week
for the winter.
Oak Gove, Clackamas county, has
voted a 10-mlll tax for paved road.
Says Crescent City
Will Get Harbor;
E. L. Kendull, a prominent real
estate man of Crescent City, was In
the city the first of the week attend
ing to business matters. Mr. Kendall
says Crescent City Is confidently
looklng forward to the granting of j date for mayor. Mr. Wagner has sc
an appropriation for a harbor there icepted and is now a candidate.
by the coming congress. He states
that Jim Owens, head of big Del
Norte timber Interests, will be sent
back to the coming session of con
gress and that the Crescent City folks
confidently believe tnat the city has
a fifty-fifty chance of securing the
appropriation. The outcome of the
presidential campaign in California
is expected to be a big influence for,
as Mr. Kendall says, "the democrats
ought to have a soft place in their
hearts for California."
The road over the mountains from
Crescent City was pretty wet, accord
ing to Mr. Kendall, and he expected
to run Into snow on the return trip.
Next spring the Del Norte county

class road out to connect with the
macadamized road running out of
Grants Pnss. This road if built
would be a great asset to Crescent
City. As a sconlc wonder it would
approach the Siskiyou grade and
Columbia River highway.
Mr. Kendall says tilings are quiet
now at Brookings, thirty miles north
of Crescent City on the coast, and
that the crew has been cut down for
the present, but that the company
expects to begin operations soon after
the first of the year with a big pay
roll and probably will employ 1,500
men by aummor.
