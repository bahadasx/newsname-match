In recent conversations with
farmers regarding the areas to be
planted to crops next year, I find
that statements are usually made
with some provisions. A com'
posite statement might be given
as follows: "If the season is
good I will put in so many
acres." It is likewise true that
throughout the growing season
we qualify our statements with
"ifs" that are directly related to
soil moisture. A great many
people who have studied the sub
ject of dry farming closely be
lieve that the question of wheth
er one succeeds or fails rests
largely with the man. Provi
dence is being blamed less and
less as time goes on for these
failures.
The following on the subject
of dry farming is offered by
John A. Widtsoe, one of our best
authorities on dry farming. It
seems very probable that this
holds true in so far as the ag
riculture of Torrance county is
concerned. Take it for what it
is worth.
DROUTH.
''Drouth is said to be the arch
enemy of the dry-farmer. but
few agree upon its meaning. For
the purposes of this volume.
drouth may be defined as a con
dition under which crops fail to
mature because of an insufficient
supply of water. Providence
has generally been charged with
causing drouths, but under the
above definition, man is usually
the cause. Occasionally, relative
ly dry years may occur, but they
are seldom dry enough to cause
crop failures if proper methods
of farming have been practiced.
There are four chief causes of
drouth: (1) Improper or care
less preparation of the soil; (2)
failure to store the natural pre
cipitation in the soil; (3) failure
to apply proper cultural methods
for keeping the moisture in the
soil needed by plants, and (4)
sowing too much seed for the
available soil-moiBture.
Crop failures due to untimely
frosts, blizzards, cyclones, tor
nadoes, or hail may perhaps be
charged to Providence, but the
dry farmer must accept the re
sponsibility for any crop injury
resulting from drouth. A fairly
accurate knowledge of the cli
matic conditions of the district, a
good understanding of the prin
ciples of agriculture without ir
rigation under a low rainfall, and
a vigorous application of these
principles as adapted to the lo
cal climatic conditions will make
dry-farm failures a rarity."
Roland Harwell,
County Agricultural Agent.
DISTRICT COURT
PROCEEDINGS
SCHOOy OTES
Upon the return of the teach
ers from Santa Fe. each one was
enthusiastic over the success of
the association, and each voted
the picturesque old city.tobea
most genial host.
The foundation for the new
building was laid last week.
While this is all that is to be
done at this time, work in real
earnest will begin in the early
spring and by next session Es
tancia will have a modern build
ing of which she may well be
proud.
At a recent meeting of the
Board of Education it was de
cided to install a steam heating
plant in the new building. The
architect was ordered to draw up
plans and specifications. This is
a broad step in the right direc
tion, and shows that the board
has the interest of the com
munity at heart.
Our enrollment continues to
grow. At present there are 125
and new ones coming in every
few days. The large increase
is due to the number of new
families that are coming into our
midst.
Our number of students who
are doing light housekeeping
continues to grow also. At
present there are five. While in
Santa Fe Prof. Park consulted
with Mr. Mersfelder, state di
rector of industrial education,
and plans are under way by
which high school pupils may re
ceive credit for domestic science
where they do this kind of housekeeping.
This locality has suffered a
week of bad weather, with but
slight intermission windy and
cold with just a little snow. But
it isn't our fault If those peo
ple east of us will persist in hav
ing blizzards and storms, there's
bound to be more less bluster
here.
Following brings the proceed
ings of district court down to
date of adjournment:
W. W. Wagner vs. N. L.
Williams, judgment for plaintiff
with coBts. plaintiff to have im
mediate possession of stock.
State vs. J. A. Will, continued
on snowing oí defendant that
it was impossible to have the at
tendance of a necessary witness.
John Vanderford vs. W. W.
Wagner, judgment for plaintiff
for damages in sum of $60 and
costs, including witness fees,
also J. P. court costs.
Manuel Olein vs. A. E. Lucas.

damages, and costs, including
witness fees; execution to issue.
Abo Land Co. vs. J. P. Dun-
lavy, etal, judgment for plaintiff;
that defendants James P. Dun
lavy and Porter H. Hower have
no title or claim to lands in ques
tion; plaintiff decreed to be own
er of lots 7 to 12 inclusive block
17; all block 7, fractional lots 14
to 19, inclusive, block 10: lot 7,

ment for total of $1,005.41 and

tachment, for all of which ex
ecution is ordered to issue.
State vs Pascual Gil alias
Frank Gallegos, dismissed.
State vs. Procopio Lopez, de
fendant and bondsmen failed to
appear; judgment of lower court
affirmed and bond declared forfeited.
In re application of Julius
Mever. sheriff, and Dee Robin
son, deputy sheriff, for appraise
ment of automobiles; J. (J. .Peter
son of Estancia and McCloskey
and Butler of Albuquerque ap
pointed appraisers to determine
the present value of said auto
mobiles and consequent wear and
tear, and to report their findings.
Laura C. Killough vs. Charles
S Killough, found that both par
ties are equally at fault; divorce
granted; that minor child should
be in custody of its mother, but
as she is engaged in teaching
school and cannot while so en
gaged give child proper care,
and as defendant objects to child
being kept in home of plaintiff's
parents, and parties agreed
thereto, child is to be kept by
Mrs. McMullen while plaintiff is
engaged in teaching school, or
such other person as may be
agreed upon in writing by the
parties. Found that each of
parties to suit should pay their
own respective costs and attor
ney fees; that welfare of child
demands that court should super
vise and exercise the right of
guardianship over it for purpose
of making any further orders
that may be necessary in future
to the end that child may re
ceive a good education and be
surrounded by proper environ
ment, defendant bear expense of
clothing and maintenance of
child while in care of a person
other than plaintiff; each to have
privilege of visiting child; in
junction against taking child out
of county; decree kept open for
such further orders as may be
necessary.
State vs. August Kayser, con
tempt: defendant pleaded that
offense was through ignorance
and without malice; sentenced to
60 days in jail. This case grew
out of the Blake vs Cavins case.
State vs. Robert E Howe, de
fendant sentenced to ten years
in penitentiary, ando pay costs.
Sentence suspended and defend
ant placed under parole, to re
port to clerk first day of each
month.
All cases not otherwise dis
posed of, continued to next term.
DANGER SIGNAL
If the fire bell should rinar would you
run nd atoo it or so and helo to put
outthenre.' it la much Che same way
with a cough. A cough is a dansrer
signal aa much aa ore bell. You
ahould no more try to suppress it than
to atop a fire bell when it is ringing,
but ahould cure the diaease that causea
the coughing. This can nearly always
be done by taking Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. Many have used it with the
most beneficial resulta. It ia especial
ly valuable for the persistent cough
that so often follows a bad cold or an
attack of the grip. Mrs. Thomas
Beeching, Andrews, Ind., writes:
During tne winter my husband takes
cold easily and coughs and coughs.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy is the
best medicine for breaking up these
attacks and you cannot get him to take
any other." Obtainable everywhere.
