CHILD KILLS
HERJBROTHER
A very distressing accident occur
red at Springfield Saturday night,
where the fish hatchery operated by
George Isaacs is located. Mr. and
Mrs. Isaacs and their children live in
the vicinity.
It appears that Mrs. Isaacs had oc
casion to use a revolver, while about
the premises, and had started to lay
the weapon away, but for the moment
placed it on a dresser or table. The
little girl watched her opportunity and
secured the gun. Pointing it at her
brother as she did the toy pistol, rhe
snapped it, and a bullet tore through
one of the boy's arms and entered the
intestines. Mr. Isaacs immediately
rushed the injured lad to Blackfoot,
where everything possible was done,
but the child died.
The family is much grieved over the
unfortunate accident, and particularly
in that the child was the only son.
The father of the dead child is the
manager of the fish hatchery at Spring
field; near here.
- Denies the Journalistic Allegation.
Harry Helden, the popular Idaho Falls
attorney, and a gentleman in every re
spect, was in Blackfoot Tuesday on le
gal business. While h'e is justly proud
of the distinction ox being the lead
ing criminal lawyer of Southeastern
Idaho, and we will add all Idaho,
he does not seem to enjoy the alle
gation that he has recently launched
into the choppy sea of journalism by
identifying himself with the Idaho Falls
daily paper that has been on the rocks
every since it was first established, a
misfortune to its energetic owners, and
a discredit to the flourshing, promising
citv of Idaho Falls.

Death of Prominent Citizen
w
SAMUEL J. RICH
Samuel J. Rich, one of the best
known men of the southeastern part
of Idaho, died Friday at Los Angeles.
Mr. Rieh has been prominent in
public life in Idaho for many years,
and was at one time immigration com
missioner under Governor Hawley. He
was also the author of ' ' The Dawn of
Plenty," a book dealing with the re
sources of the state, which attracted
wide attention.
The Rich family produced a num
ber of eminent men. The founder of
the family in Idaho was Apostle C. C.
Rich, one of the first Mormon settlers
to make his way to the Bear lake
country. A brother of Samuel J.
Rieh was the late Ben Rich, a well
known physician.
Samuel J. Rich, after abandoning
the practice of law several years ago,
began to devote much time to ranch
ing. He has spent the last few win
ters in California, and returned to Los
Angeles as usualy this year. His
health has been failing for about a
year, his ailment being heart trouble.
At the time of his death Mrs. Rich
and their daughters were at the bed
side. There are four sons in Idaho,
Grover, Walker, Roscoe and Elwood
Pich.
Mr. Rich was born in Centerville,
Utah, in 1860. He was educated in
the schools of Bear Lake county,
Utah, until 15 years of age, when he
•started out for himself, working for
several of the big cattlemen of Utah,
Idaho and Nevada. Later he entered
the law sehool at Provo, and early
established himself in the profession.
He served as county attorney in sev
eral Utah counties, finally locating at
Blackfoot in 1899, where he has since
made his home. He leaves a wife,
aged mother, four sons and three
daughters. He was a member of the
Boise Elks, had served as a presidential
elector, delagato to several national
conventions, and had been a power in
the Democrcatic party in Idaho, for
years. The remains arrived in Black
foot on the 9 o'clock train Tuesday eve
ning and was met by many frineds
and relatives and escorted to the Rich
farm. Tuessday afternoon about }.
o'clock they were conveyed to the First
Ward church, that was filled to over
flowing with the bereaved relatives and
sympathizing friends. The funeral ser
vices were under the direction of Bish
op Buchanan, and the ceremony was
opened by President Jas. Duckworth
and dosed by Hon. L. R. Thomas. At
tornev General Peterson, at one time
a law partner of the deceased, delivered
a very able and touching eulogy on the
life that has just been closed. Other
addresses were deliver by Hon. P. G.
Johnston and Senator Ed. Pugmire of
Bear Lake county. The Elks lodge, of
which Mr. Rich was a member, furnish

decased brother last night, anti the lo
cal bar of Blackfoot, of which Mr.
Rich was one of the oldest members,
held a special memorial meeting this

Resolutions of Condolence.
Whereas, We realize that, in the sud
den death of Samuel J. Rich at Los
Angeles, California, on the 8th day of
December, 1916, the bar of the state
of Idaho, and particularly the Bar of
the sixth judicial district, the district
of his residence, has lost one of its
earliest and most estimable members;
Whereas, In his long and varied ex
perience as a lawyer he was uniformly
courteous to , the court, generous and
kindly to his fellow lawyers, and par
ticularly to the younger members of
the profession, and always regardful
of the ethics of his calling;
Whereas, He sought always to instill
in those less experienced than himself
a genuine respect for the law, a cour
teous bearing towards the court and
the members of the bar, and a keen
appreciation of the responsibilities of
the profession;
Whereas, Those who knew him in
his business dealings and relations
knew him to have been honest ami up
right, and thsoe who knew him in his
home life knew him to have been an
affectionate and indulgent husband and

ELECTRIC UNE
IS ASSURED
The work of promoting the cleetric
railroad from Preston to Ashton is ad
vancing satisfactorily, according to of
ficials of the company.
The board of directors have arranged
with the local engineers to begin the
survey of the route to determine grade
and route, and it is hoped to begin
construction early in the coming year.
Mr. Musser, superintendent of the.,
company at Blackfoot, states that sev
eral bonding houses Land sent repres
entatives to Pocatello, with a view to
purchase the company's bonds when is
sued. The financial world was never in
better condition to build such a rail
road as now, and suel^ investments
(electric, railroads) arc being sought
by monied men. Among the advan
tages which the new road will bring
to the people'of the Snake river val
ley are better transportation faeilities,
bettter and elieaper passenger service
and the distribution of elect riet, light
and power to patrons along the line of
the road.
The present lines in Utah, knowin as
the Orem-Bambeyer Eeclos lines, give
a 2c per-mile fare as against 3c and 4c
per-mile fare on the steam road. The
electric line runs a car between princi
pal towns each hour, and every two
hour's in the more remote districts. Be
sides doing a passenger business, they
haul all kinds of freight, having simi
lar traffic arrangements with eastern
and western outlets as the steam roads.
The officers of the company have
decided to increase, the organization
from its present strength, about 250
to 500, giving those whose property
is t.o be benefited along the line the
privlege of subscribing for stock to the
amount of $100 each.
This gives, not only the necessary
financial aid to do the preliminary
work necessary to place the property
in a bonding condition, but provides
a support by those who influence traffic
for the future maintenance of the road.
Among the stockholders of the com
pany now are the leading bankers, iner
