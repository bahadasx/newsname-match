Don't Have Catarrh
One efficient way to remove
nasal catarrh is to treat its cause
which in most cases is physical
weakness. The system needs
more oil and easily digested
liquid-food, and you should
.take a spoonful of
mm
(SflBoMD
after each meal to enrich your
blood and help heal the sensi
tive membranes with its pure
oil-food properties.
The results of this Scott'
EmuUion treatment will
surprise those who have used
irritating snuffs and vapors.

SCRAPS OF VERSE AND PROSE
By Clara Cox Epperson.
Just to Bmile for awhile. ,
Will dry each falling tear;
Just to smile all the while,
Will banish every fear.
Smiles are to tha h onrta nf thin
world Just what the blessed sunshine
is to the plants. When we meet the
smile of love it lifts up our hearts in
siauuess; wnen we meet the smile of
cmuiuasemeut u mts up our hearts
in hope divine: and when we feel the
warmth of God's loving smile In the
heart, then la it ecstasy sublime.
No child's heart can develop in
strength, beantv and
smile-less home, any more than can
a ueucaie piani grow and bloom in
beauty in darkness drear.
"Laugh and the world laughs with
you" may be easily paraphrased Into
"smile and tha phllH omIUa with
for it la Alone" thA mval rngrl f
ous smiles that you must travel to
roach the Inmost heart of a little
child.
It means so little. Just a smile,
But how much care It will beguile;
Then lay aside your frowns awhile.
And gladden your loved on3 with a
Bmile.
It is a smile that can make the
lace of old aere soft and awrtiv
tiful; while under the vinegary acid
of frowns the face shrivels and yel
lows like parchment.
It is said, we are nnlv an nlrf n
our arteries. It were better said we
are only as old as our smile3, and
when they cease, then may the world
indeed pronounce us old.
Humor Is truly the saving salt of
life, and if you cannot see the world
through rose colored glasses, try at
least to boa it thrones tiiitnnrmia
lenses, then will the weight of years
sit but lightly upon you.
If for each care you will prepare
A joyous Bmile, dear:
If you will say, "To every day
I'll give a smile," dear.
More Joyfully the world will move.
And you will daily, hourly prove
To the world and those you love
Your life's worth while, dear.
BUNDLE DAY
Monday, Dec. 18th, has been ap
pointed by the United Charities as
Bundle Day. Let every one who has
anything in the way of clothing, or
provisions that they are willing to
give to this worthy cause get same
ready and notify either telephone ex
change and the bundle will be sent
for.
Remember that the high cost of
living and this extremely cold weath
er is bringing about much suffering
and whatever you may have to give
may be the means of relieving some
one. Remember also that lots of
homes will not be visited by Santa
Claus this Christmas unless you help
his worthy cause; therefore every
bundle should have in It one or more
well filled stockings of good things to
eat and maybe a little toy or two for
some precious child who will be made
extremely happy by your gift.
The need is great and the time to
do good la now. Let us have a boun
tiful response. .

GOING IT TOO HARD?
Overwork, worry, overeating and
lack of exercise and sleep are respon
sible for much kidney trouble. If
your back aches and the kidneys
seem weak, rest up and use Dean's
Kidney Pills.
S. S. Stanton, registrar in court,
Sparta St., Cookeville, says: "I bad
awful attacks of kidney complaint.
My bck pained me constantly and I
had sharp twinges through my loins
when I stooped or lifted. My back
was sore and lame mornings and I
was.also subject to nervous and diz
zy spella. The kidney secretions
were at times profuse, then again
scanty. Whenever I caught cold, it
settled on my kidneys, making my
backache worse. When I read about
Doan's Kidney Pills, I got some at
Neal and Staley's Drug Store. They
soon relieved th pains in my back
and put my kidneys in good shape."
Price 60c at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mr. Stanton had. Foster-Milburn
