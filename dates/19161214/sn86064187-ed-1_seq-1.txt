Congressman Writes Secrc
tar y of War,
POSITIONS ARE AT STAKE
Many Employers Will Not Hold
Jobs After First.
fetters urging that Oklahoma mi
litiamen be withdrawn from Mexican
border service before January 1 have
been "tit by Congressman Srott Icr
ris of Oklahoma to Newton D. Ma
ker, scctetary of war; Cirnrral Fred
erick I'lintnti, commanding the troops
on the hordrr; llngadirr General Wil
liam A Matin, hrail of thr militia bu
reau, and Major Hugh I.. Srott, chief
of staff of the war department.
Letter Received Here.
Copies of the Inter to Mr Ilaker. in
which Mr I nut asserts that, unless
Oklahoma troop are relieved from
border duty hy Jan. 1, 117 their em
ployers - many of whom have been
tarrying them on the payrolls and in
addition luring substitutes can no
longer continue such generosity, wrtf
re. rived here today,
'I lie Irttrr to the secretary of war
li a follows:
"I appeal to you partially on behalf
of thr rniplovrrs of member of the
Oklahoma militia on the txuder and
partiallv on behalf of the militiamen
themselves and want to ntgc you with
all the earnestness I have at my com
mand to permit their withdrawal from
thr border between now ami Jan I,
1917. The situation in a word, Mr.
Secretary, is simply this:
Positions at Stake.
"The employers of militiamen have
carried the latter on the payrolls and
hi.:i held their positions open for
them throughout all the present calen
dar year, but they are unwilling to
continue this pro edure and unwilling
to retain substitute employe and
carry the militiamen on the payrolls
longer than Jan. 1, 117. Unlev the
boys on the border are permitted to
return home in the meantime and re
sume their old positions which have
been held open for them all this time,
it will work a great hardship upon
them ami inflict a greater injury upon
them than they ought to be compelled
to endure.
"Manv of the militiamen when they
went to the border left little private
businesses behind them and these have
almost gone to rack and ruin. The
appeals that come to me from the em
ployers ami the parents ot the noys
and others are so insistent that they
cannot be loiter ignored.
Sent In July.
"As you are aware, our hoy! were
tient to' the border July 19. Tn keep
them longer, unless there be greater
emergency than now apparently ex
ists, would have the effect of making
our boys on future occasions unwill
ing to become militiamen and it would
have a bad effect all around.
"Will you not, please, at the earliest
moment, consider the advisability of
their withdrawal from the border, and
lee if it cannot be brought about
prior to Jan. 1, 1917, so that the boyi
tnav on the first of the new year re
turn to their old positions. If any
formal application or formal order it
required in their behalf, I should be
Klad to make it for them. So many
of them I know personally, so many
of their conditions I am well acquaint
ed with that I most earnestly urge
you to let them return home." .
