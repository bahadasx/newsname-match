Police Defied as Crowd
Avenges Shots Fired

A mob of 500 enraged men and hoys
surged back and f*?rth through the
narrow streets of Greenwich >
last night, seeking the life of a man
who had wantonly fired hnl? a doren
revolver shot? at inoffensive persons,
wounding one and imperilling the
lives of many women and children.
i Braving the menace of a policeman's
revolver, the angry throng swept over
him and the man they sought, parting

sticks. When the battle was over the
mob had gained its end. Its victim,
Paulo Roleta, cf 226 West Houston

The trouble began when Roleta,
without war-insr, drew n revolver nt

up Perry Street, tiring wildly. One

Berlin, Pre. 11 By wireless to Say
Ville). Germany'? replv to the in?
quiries of the United States into the
matter of the Belgian unemployed and
the deportation of Belgian? is pub
to-day in the "Norddeutsche Al?
gemeine Zeitung," and i? civen out by
the Oveneaa News Agency ns follows:
"The government of the United Statea
of Ameriea hn? protested against
the transportation of Belgian work
inpmen to Germany and against
their eompulaory employment for
work, bnsing this on the view
thea? meaaun? are in contra
of humane principles and
? 'ernn'.ional practice ns to tho
Bent of the population In occu?
pied territory. The German govern?
ment thinks that the government of tho
United State? hn.? been incorrectly in?
formed regarding the cause and the
execution of the measures, and there?
fore considers it appropriate first to
explain the fncts in detail.
"In Belgium unemployment for a
ierable time has been extending
in a perplexing fashion among the in?
dustrial workintrmen. This prevalence
of unemployment hns been caused by
the English policy of isolation, which
has eat off Belgian industry from the
importation of raw material nnd tho
exportation of manufactured goods,
nnd hns thus brought the greater part
of Heltrian industry to a standstill.
1,200,000 Out of Jobs
"By thi? measure almost half of the
ivr.rkinjrmen in Belgian factories, num?
bering altogether in round figures
bOO, wer" deprived of the possi?
bility of earning a living and many
more than half a million Belgians who
formerly supported themselves by in
duc*nr.l work were made dependent
upon public relief. Adding the mem?
bers of their families, this number is
increased threefold, or, in round fig?
ure?-, l,"tO0,OO0 perrons.
"From the standpoint of Belgian
economic right, upon which thes* un?
employed inflict a heavy burder, n?
also from the standpoint of public
order and public morals, which ara
most dangerously affected hy general
unemployment and 'he aceompanvine:
consequences, this situation mikes it
extremely desirable and urgent that
efficient measures for improvement be
taken. This necessity has been recog

PARLEY AT HAGUE
IS GERMAN WISH
Conference of Delegates
to Determine Objectives
of War Is Aim
Washington, Dee. 13.?Count von
RernstorfT probably wiil visit Secre?
tary Lansing in a day or two f??r tl I
purpose of seeking some indication of
the views of the Uoitod State? on
the German peace proposals. He has
no specific instructions from his gov?
ernment on this point and no dispatch
regarding the peace proposals has been
received by the embassy during the
last twenty-four hours. The ambassa
l dor, however, is keeping his govern?
ment informed of prevailing opinion
on the question :n America.
In German circles here to-day it is
said that the real aim of the peace pro?
posal is a conference between d'a?
gates from all tho belligerent coun?
tries, with a view to an exchange of
views as to the objects which each
side is fighting for and as to possible
terms of peace.
Such a conference might be held at
The Hague about the middle of Jan?
uary.
? nunt von RernstorfT ?old to-night
that peace terms would doubtless not
1?.' ?liscussed either publicly or
through exchange of communications.
He is understood to regard a confer?
ence between representativa? of the
belligerents ns a necessary prelimi?
nary to any discussion of terms.
At least one diplomat representing a
neutral nation in Washington has
planned to ask his government to au?
thorize him to present in its behalf to
, President Wilson assurance of support
in nny move designeil to secure consid?
eration by the Entcpte Allies of the
ofTrr to discuss peace. Other repro
i sentatives of neutral nations have simi?
lar action under consideration.
In Teutonic diplomatic quarter? it
wns reiterated to-night that Germany
expects neutrals, especially those in
Europe, to do everything possible to
bring about at least a ?liscussion of
peace terms. No information regard?
ing the intentions of Switzerland and
Spain, the other neutral nations
through which the proposals are being
transmitted, has been received here.

BERLIN TO KEEP U-BOAT PLEDGES
Submarines Have Not
Violated Promise,
Zimmerman Says
_
STRICT ORDERS
GIVEN CAPTAINS
Asserts U. S. Is Rousing
i Fear of Unneutral Lean?
ing to Britain
Berlin, Doc. 1.1 (by wirele<. to
Sayvi'.le).?"I can affirm with abso?
lute certainty that no German sub?
marine has intentionally attacked a
merchant ship without warning and
without giving; all on board ample
time and opportunity for rescue,"
declared Dr. Alfred Zimmerman,
I Secretary for Foreign Affairs, in a
i discussion to-day with a member of
the Overseas News Agency.
"The orders to the commanders of
i our submarines are clear and strict
| in thia direction," he continued,
i "You will have read a report about
' a submarine that found during
stormy weather a steamer near the
Spanish roast, which it was entitled
1 to sink, and which waited many
hours patiently because the weather
made it impossible to rescue those
on board.
"You will recall other German
submarines taking the crews of tor?
pedoed steamers on board until the
sea was smooth and a passing; ship
could take them over."
Alarmed at United States Attitude
Dr. Zimmerman had spoken of the
impression created in Germany by
the attitude of the United States
toward Germany and Great Britain
as outlined in an Associated Pres3
Washington dispatch of Novem?
ber 19.
[The dispatch referred to said in
part: "The American attitude is
flat and final. No technicalities
will be accepted. Ships must not
be sunk without warning or with?
out provision for the safety of pas?
sengers. The armed ship issue
will not be accepted."]
"As to the impie-sion created." con?
tinued Dr. Zimmerman, "almost since
the beginning of th-? war two currents
of opinion could be discerned in Ger?
many. Judging by the rules of neu?
trality, the I'niterl States intentionally
favored Great Britain in an almost
outspoken fa?hion, according to some;
others took th? view that tho United
States was neutral in spirit and action.
"The discussion between the advo?
cates of these two opinions was some?
times very animated. This discussion
xvas reopened by the dispatch in ques?
tion.
Shock to America'? Defender?
"The partie? and newspapers that
did not believp that America was ob?
serving itliet neutrality accepted tho
dispatch as confirmation of their opin?
ion, and to the others the news came
as a ?hock.
"To understand this effect one has
only to recall the largo number of
facts which have been before the eyes
of the German public during tho last
few years.
"England has repeatedly announced
that all English ships ought to be
ready to destroy German submarines
wherever they find them. This has
been publicly proclaimed, as well by
private as by official persons in Eng?
land. Quite recently Lord Robert Cecil,
in the British Parliament, gave ex?
pression to this view.
'"The London Times' of November
21 published a lr-t'er from a well
known Member of Parliament and ship?
owner (Robert P. Houston), promising
a prize of $l<Vino to every English
born captain who, with an English
merchant ?hip, destroyed a German
submarine.
Tske l,aw Into Our Hand?
"Houston on thi.? occasion added that I
English sailors ought to return to the
method? of Hawkina and Drake, or
should imitate the example ?et by
Nelson in the (.'openhagren case ?they
oucht to take the ?ea law Into their
own hand?. Houston wa.? fully con
?eiou? that he advocated and B?Ivi?^d
? contrary to the law of nation?.
"We further knew that hostile sub?
marines have ?racked and in son??
cuses have sunk German merchantmen
without the ?lightest warning. Thus
were ?unk the German itoamars FVjrge.
meister Votmeile, Lorita, the Kibe and
Hollandia. They were all attacked by
enemy submarin?.? with artillery or
torpedoes withojt the shadow of a
warning.
"These fact?, of course, justify the
suspicion that nmong other German
?teamer? which are aimply overdue or
have not return?d aeveral met their
end in the ?ame fnrhion.
"In one ease, that of the steamer
Kolga, we know it from survivors. In
this case ?even hum?n live? wero lost
and survivor? declared that a British
submarine ealm'v steered around th?
sinking ship without even stirring a
hend toward rescue. I merely refer to
this in order to (V-lain the feeling of'
the German population.

FRENCH PREMIER SAYS FOE
SEERS TO DISRUPT ENTENTE
Paris, Pre. t$,?Premier Briavd, addressing the
Chamber before it voted confidence in the neu' ministry
tthday, said of G*vrmany*s peace offer:
I have the duty to place my country on guard against
possible poisoning. When a country arms itself to the
teeth, when it seizes men everywhere in violation of the
laws of nations and enforces labor upon them, I should be
guilty if I did not cry out to my country : "Look out ! Take
can*!"
I have the right in the first place to say to our enemies
for the hundredth time: "The blood is on your hands, not
upon ours." Not that I doubt the clearsightedness of my
country, but in the face of theM attempts to spread dis?
sension among the Allies I exclaim: "The French Republic
will not do less than the convention!
"No one can .??ay that I have been unduly optimistic,
but to-day, more than ever, we must have the conviction
that victory is certain."
GERMANY HAS
TERMS READY
Will SubmitConditions
if Allies Want to
Consider Them
Berlin, Dec. 12.?Although Chancel?
lor von Bethmann-Hollweg did not dis?
close the definite proposals on which
Germany and her allies are prepared to
| make peace in his speech before the
! Reichstag, such proposals are ready,
1 and will be communicated to the En
[ tente Powers if the Chancellor's offer
! should fall upon re?ponsive ears.
In the corridor? of the Reichstag, !
where, after tne historic twenty-min
Ut? session, the members gathered in
keen discussion of the Chancellor's
fpeech, the general opinion expressed .
was that the situation would be advan
tageoua to Germany whether or not the ,
Chancellor's offer was accepted by the j
Entente.
Some of the opponents of the Chnn- I
cellor are oppo?ed to any move in the ^
direction of peace except on the basis
of "woe to the conquered." Moat mem?
bers of the Reichstag, however, ex?
press the opinion that ?M Emperor's
decision was wise and timely, and
showed pleasure at the formal step I
taken toward ending the war.
The speech of the Chancellor was not |
marked by a single exprt-ssion of dis- j
sent from the Deputies, while the sig- i
i.iticant passages were greeted with ;
hearty bravos and cheers. It was no- |
ticeahle, however, that Count Friedrich
von Westarp, the Conservative leader,
and others of his following sat silent
and unmoved even when the galleries
and newspaper men joined demonstra?
tively in the applause.
When the Chancellor had concluded
his speech an attempt was made to
force an Immediate debate by the an-I
aexattoniat bloc, under Major Ernst
Baa lennana, leader of the National
I. berals, and Count Westarp. supported
by th? Extreme Socialists.
This move was firmly resisted by the
leaders of the moderate parties, who
agreed with the Chancellor that a gen?
eral discussion of possible peace con?
ditions before the attitude of the en- I
emy pow ?rs was made known could
ealy injure the cause of peace and
place Germany at a diplomatic disad- ;
vantage
Their attitude was that if the Cea?
tral Power? expor.od all their card? be?
fore peace negotiations began they ;
would be placed at a disadvantage.

ple, we should be on jruard not to bo

ing to extract value from the capture
of Hucharest, after the period of de?
pression Qorosaay had to undergo last
autumn.
German? War Weary
"It is no secret that Germans are
fatigued by the war, which ha? beon
far longer than they ever expected it
would be, and they have been calling
for peace for months. The speech of
the Chancellor is expected to open new
prospects for them. Hut what sort of ,
peace do they want?
"The wor??s at tho Chancellor are
only one more manoeuvre. It was only
an opportunity to say a^-ain to the Ger?
man people that Germany wants peace,
but the Allies will not hear of it It ,
is evident he only seeks to offer some
sort of verbal satisfaction to the peo- ?
pie, who suffer more and more every
day."
"It is impossible," say? "The Jour?

so na?ve as to ?apoOM that the Allies
would fall into .??.ich an open trap. In
?ny case, Hindenburg shows in hi? re- ?

offers are anything but sincere.
"The German government is trying
to convince the people of Germany that
it is not responsible for the hardship?
imposed upon them. The German Deo
pig have been reduced to ?uch a point
that they demand moral support, if
they aro to be willing to continue the
war.
Aille* Want Real Peace
"They are down to the point now
where, despite their vigor, they will be
weaker in victory than in defeat if the
people are allowed to continue in the
idea that they are suffering only be?
cause of the ambition? of some few
men whj are in position? of power.
"It is because Germany knows she
cannot conquer that she wants to stop
now, but the Allies demand real peace,
and neither can nor will be turned
from their course.
"but it is not only the German peo
ple that the Kaiser has to satisfy, but
also the German army. For several

trenches have been short of food. That
is more serious than a shortage among

Some Papers Believe Brit?

Terms
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER
[Itjr it'.'? to T!-.i? T
London, Dec. 18. ?After a day of
consideration, most Britons interpret
Germany's offer to enter into peace
negotiations as:
An effort to spread discord among
the members of the Entente.
An effort to buoy the faltering
spirit? within the Fatherland.
An effort to Injure the Aille??' canae
' In the eye? of neutrals.
A forerunner of and Justification
for a wider campaign of frightful
ne?? on the sea.
How many of these aims will be
realized, time alone will tell. This
much is certain: the Germans will
fall far short of accomplishing the
first, France is more determined
and more united with her allies than
ever before. The same may be said
cf Belgium. Britain remains firm,
united, confident, determined.
No doubt peace has been brought a
little nearer, but not through any
change in the position of the Allies.
Germany must come to them. They
will not go to the Kaiser?not e\*en
half way.
Lloyd George to ?**peak
I write this after talking with
, many Britons of various shades of
I opinion, and sorrre Frenchmen, Rus
! Mans and Beliriarui resident hoto.
I The pacifist.? will fight hard, but un
I successfully, this round.
Premier Lloyd George is'expected
? to reply to the German note in the
' House of Commons on Tuesday,
! when he makes his initial address as
I head of the government. In this con
I r.ection, the following1 official state?
ment was ??.sued to-night by the
Press Bureau
"The Prime Minister presided at
a meeting of the War Cabinet this
mornin*:, but he is still suffering
from the chill he contracted, his
voice, in particular, being? affected.
His doctor has ordeied complete rest
for a day or two."
Meanwhile, Britain's official atti?
tude may be summarized as follows:
It is still unknown here whether
any concrete term? of peace accom?
pany Germany's note to the neutral
nhtions. Judging from the speech
of Chancellor von Hethmann-Holl
xveg, the terms that Germany is will?
ing to offer are scarcely likely to bo
even worthy of discussion.
Britain will join in no peace con?
ference where the German frame of
mind is such that acceptance of her
terms insures Prussian domination
of Europe for at least a century.
Moreover, the Allies will not con?
sider any secret terms proposed.
This is a democratic war on their
part, and they mean to have a demo?
cratic peace conference whenever the
time arrives.
Aille?' Peace Terms
In response to the reports cabled
from Washington a? to the terms of
peace which Germany is prepared to
offer, leaders her? outlined tho?e
which the Allies would regard as their
minimum. They are believed neeeaaary
to aa?ure that Germany ?hall not
again be able to ?tart with confidene?
on a career of conquest or again dare
fight without regard to law and hu?
manity. They are:
Agreement for the limitation cf
armaments and armies.
Punishment of those responsible
for the atrocities committed by
German forcee and violations of the
laws of humanity.
Indemnity, or, more likely, the
restoration, ton for ton, of all Al?
lied or neutral ?hipping destroyed
hy German submarine? contrary to
law.
Ceasion of the Dardanelles and
Bosporus to Ru??la.
The evacuation of ell occupied
territory', ?* ith return of ?tl
illegal levies and fine?, and In?
demnities for ?II devaatation. These
Include Belgium, northern France,
Poland, Serbia, Montenegro and
Rumania.
Restoration to France of Alsace
Lorraine,
Even if there la to be an Allied re?
ply to the German offer, it will net

of the Entente would have to decide
on it? own account, and then thera
would have to be ? g.-neeal contulta
