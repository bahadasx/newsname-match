high Cost of Bad Roads.
The road that connects your
farm with the nearest town has 1
more to do with the cost of living,f
doubtless, than you realize.
Have you ever thought that every
article you buy must be hauled c
over the road; that your teams
and vehicles or your automobile c
must bear the '-wear and tear"
caused by a rough road to sell
farm products or to bring the ne.
cessities from the town?
The fact that your neighbor a
must also pay the high cost of
bad roads is all the better reaeon
why you, he and the rest of the
neighborhood should get together
and improve the road to save
some of this expense. What you
and your neighbors lrose in haul
ing farm products over bad roads
would soon build a good road and
give you quick and satisfactory
service.
How long can you afford such
loss? And when shall the road
be improved?
