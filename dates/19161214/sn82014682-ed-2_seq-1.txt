hepe that the stranding of the U. S.

bay here in a heavy fog today will not
result In a traced was aroused this
afternoon when members of the crew
were teen, through the fog and spray,
at work on the Wrecked superstructure
of the craft ...
After the hat;nes had been battened
- down, and at a time when it was be
lleved that the 22 men aboard were
using their air-supply, being impris
oned in the steel shell, a man's form
was seen emerging from a hatch. He
endeavored to catch a life-line which
was shot to him from the beach, but
the heavy waves breaking over the
hull drove him below.
The weight of the'waves finally mov
ed the submarine 150 feet nearer the
beach. It is now believed thit the
vessel is leaking or that her tanks
have been filled Intentionally in an
effort to make her steady, as she is
apparently very low.
- Later five men appeared on deck
with axes and began cutting at the
wrecked superstructure. Another at
tempt to make the life-line fast has

EUREKA, Cal, Dec. 14. The U. S.
submarine H-3, with 22 officers and
men. Is ashore hear the entrance to
Eureka bay, heeled over in fairly deep
water, and all the rescue forces and
apparatus which can 'bf lummoMd
are at work endeavoring to reach the
vessel. There are 22 officers and men
arboard. '
- The H-3 went ashore while en route,
with her sitter-ew4mar4nesH-t and
H2, . from : Bremerton' navy yard to
Mars Island. Coming down the coast
in the early morning hours in a dense
fog the submarine struck a shoal near
the entrance to the bay, and stuck
hard and fast ,
The monitor Cheyenne, acting ten
der to submarines, which was convoy
ing the three submerelblee down the
coast, immediately stood by, together
with the tug Relief, and the subma
rine first whistled the signal "Ail
. cafe." . -- .
A life-saving crew of the local sta
tion began work at once, endeavoring
to shoot alifellne out over the craft
The spot where the submarine struck
is between 100 and 203 yards off the
teach, and in the fog it is difficult to i
operate. The water is so shallow that
the tug and the submarine tender are
unable to come close to the stranded
craft. :
Soon after stranding the submarine
.began ttf heel over. The whistles fin
ally cosed. The' hatches were bat-
- i
tened down and It was believed that
the men aboard were using submers-j
ing equipment ana me air lanics as an
air-supply.
The fog continues to cloak the sub
marine, which the rescuers are en
deavoring desperately to reach.
The,. H-3 carries 22 officers and men,
being commarvded by Lieut H. R.
Bogusch, and Lieut E. F. Zemke being
second In command.
Submarine 1 1-3 was built as one
of four authorized under an act passed
March 1909, her contract price be
ing $491,000. She was originally named
Garfish with the official number 30.
The contractor was the Electric Boat
Company of New York, N. Yn and
the boat was built by the Moran Com
pany at Seattle, Wash.
Lieut. Bogasch, commanding the H-3,
was in 'he naval service at Honolulu

SLINGSBY BABY
SUBSTITUTE
(AttorUted Prew Federal! Wirrtesi)
LONDON, Eng., Dec. 14. The house
of lords today added another chapter
to the sensational "Slingsby case,"
involving two continents, when it re
fused the appeal from the court cf
appeals, without calling the respon
dents, thus upholding the reversal of
the lower court's decleion that little
Teddy" Slingsby is the legitimate
child of Lieut, and Mrs. C. R, Slings
by. It is now held that te child has
been proved to be the son of Lillian
Anderson. In the latest decision, the
outhorities state that they regret the,
pain which the decision must cause'
"a gallant officer now serving his coun
try." .
This is cne of the most noted cases
in legal annals and has been' fought
out in American courts for the past
several years. The case arose over
charges that another baby was substi
tuted for little "Teddy" Slingsby, son
of Lieut and Mrs. C. It. Slingsby and
heir to $300,000 property of the Slings
by family in Yorkshire, England. The
substitution was alleged to have been
made in San Francisco. The claim
was made that the real Slingsby baby,
which was born in San Francisco on
September 1, 1910. died and that the
mother substituted another Infant
After the case had been thrashed
out in San Francisco, the evidence
was submitted to the probate court
In London, which on February 3, 1915,
decided that the present Slingsby
baby is legitimate and that no sub
stitution was made. Sir Edward. Car
son, Unionist leader, has been leading
counsel for the contestant of the
child's right to the estate.
immigration"bill
with literagy test
passes upper house
fAwsociated Pre by Federal Wirele
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. , 14.
The new immigration bill, containing
the restrictive "literary test" on ac
count of which similar bills have
been persistently vetoed by Taft and
Wilson passed the senate today, 64
to 7. As it is amended It goes to the
house, having previously passed there.
The senate, before passing the bill,
reconsidered the clause designed to
exclude anarchists who teach the de
struction of property as their propa
ganda. Senator Hardwick offered an
amendment to cover the same ground,
which was adopted. In brief it per
mits the entry of persons who advo
cate or teach the destruction of prop
erty "in case of war, insurrection or
revolution," but not otherwise, thus
barring anarchists who preach destruc
tion of property In times of peace. ,

GERMANY HOLDS SINKING
OF LANA0 JUSTIFIED BY
FACTS OF OWNERSHIP
Associated Prega b Federal AVirele)
WASHINGTON. D C. Dec. 14
Germany's latest note on the subma
rine warfare is another justification
of her course. This note deals with
the sinking of the steamer Lanao,
which was sunk by a German subma
rine off the coast of Portugal October
28. The status of the Lanao has been
in some doubt She was American
owned, for a long time under Philip
pine registry, and negotiations had
been begun by her owners to sell her
to a Norwegian shipowner. At the
time the vessel was sunk she carried
papers showing her right to fly Ameri
can colors, and the U. S. government
sent a note to Germany, to discover !
whether or not there had been a vio-!
lation of the German pledge. . !
Germany's reply now contends that
the sinking of the Lanao was justi
fied as she carried contraband. Ger
many also contends: that the vessel
was cot American, having been trans
ferred , to Norwegian ownership.
