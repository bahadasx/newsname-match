BENNINGTON POTTERY
, - Famous Industry Here For
Many
Years.
At a recent meeting of the
local
tery making in Henniugton was read.
! The article was prepared by Mrs. C.
H. Emmons, daughter of the late Ed
ward Norton, and was read by her
sister, Miss Helena Norton. With a
few changes and some additions to
make It more complete, the article is
as follows:'
.Walter A. Dyer, author of "Early
American Craftsmen," says: "Pa
triotism, when i leada to war and des
olation, ceases, in my opinion to be a
virtue; but when it leads men and
WQDieiv.io- the -revival and preserva
tion of -worthy traditions and instltu-1
Hons and to the" study of history and
Industrial arts, -it becomes a positive
construptlve! price for good." With
this thought in mind we search for
the- early history of the Bennington
ipottery which was established by Cap
tain John Norton, who. was an ofllcer
ill the 18th Connecticut regiment,
served in Neiw York in 1770 and was
said to have been present at the ex
ecution of MaJ. Andre in 1780.
In 1793 John Norton with his wife
and children left their home in Shar
on. Litchfield county, Connecticut,
and drove up through Berkshire
county into Bennington. (A portion
cf the harness used on the trip is In
our possession.) He purchased land
in the south part of the town, com
prising what are now the Moses Wil
son, the W. S. 1 Human and the Chas.
Tudor farms and built liis pottery op
posite the spot , where the Hinman
house now stands. Kivo years later
he built the 'house standing north of
this property which is now occupied
by Charles Tudor and which was
known for many years as "The old
Norton (Homestead." His oldest son.
Luman, built the Hinman house end
was associated with his father in the
pottery business., .
, They manufactured an earthen
ware covered with a salt glaze, which
was very similar to stoneware but
muc lighter In weight and made jars,
jugs, milk pans,' baking dishes, plat
ters, bean pots and tho ordinary
household utensils. There are sever
al pieces of this ware known to be in
existence and many others may be
tucked away In store rooms and at
tics. Mrs. L. S. Norton has a jar
which was formerly the property of
Miss Julia Bingham's grandmother
and which Miss Bingham said, that
her grandmother told her to always
preserve as it wa3 one of the first
pieces made at the old Norton pottery
on the farm. The Ostrander family
In Hoosick have a similar pleco on
the bottom of which is written, "This
bolonged to grandfather Ostrander
and was made la the old Norton pot
tery." Mrs. W. B. Walker has an ink
well and several pieces which were
dug out of the ground In later years
when men were plowing. In appear
ance they might as the saying Is,
"antedate all dates." B. T. Henry
lrindlv loaned mo a ronelnted hill
datftd June 20th. 1815. It rAada Wll.
11am Henry Esq., bought of John Nor-1
ton & Son 12 dozen milk pans 9
shillings per dozen, J18.00. Then
three sizes of platters are mentioned,
the whole coming to $20.00 and
signed John Norton & Son.
Many years ago a cousin of my
father's told ine the happiest recol
lections of her childhood were the
days spent playing about the old pot
tery. A team of horses harnessed to
a long pole, and driven In a circle sup
plied the power for grinding the clay.
On rare occasions the children of the
family were allowed to ride on this
pole. An she xplalned:. "All the
joys of the Merry -Go-Round long be
fore the day," and if it Ere w dark be-
fore the pleasures were over and the
road to her home looked long and

I John Norton died in 1828. In 1S31
'lls son Luman, (or Judge Norton as
he was known) moved to this village
and built a pottery on the site of the
present building, 't -was about the
same size and style of architecture.
The business was conducted on a
much larger scale and they manu
factured stone ware, yellow ware and
Rockingham, which is a yellow ware
spattered btfore firing with a brown
clay, which givts the mottled ap
pearance. It was first made in Eng
land at the Swinton pottery on the es
tate of Charles Marquis of Rocking
ham, which gave tho name. Skilled
workmen came from England and
Holland. Mrs. W. H. Walker has sev
eral pieces of ware made at this time
which in color and design are as
handsome as anything made later in
the United States pottery. All this
was before tho days of railroads and
I travelling salesmen. The wire was
packet! into large wagons built for the
purpose. They had high sides and
were painted dark green and in large
yellow letters on tho side read:
"Bennington Stono Wart" and in
much smaller letters "Norton Tot
tery." It required four horses to
draw them and that they be perfectly
matched was a subject of much pride,
j These wagons went through New
England and the ware was sold at
general stores. To drive these tim8
and sell this ware was considered
the best position for young men that
i the time3 offered. It required con
' sidcrable versatility to be: able to
j handle four horses over all sorts of
roads, sell the ware, and get homo
' safely with the money. Very little
business being done through banks.
Among the early drivers were Ed
ward Norton; Henry Hall, who was
Gov. Hall's son; George Rockwood,
who was later the head of tho Rock
wood Knitting Co.; and E. L. Nichols,
whom most of us remember; Charles
Cola Sr., was also one of tho later
drivers. In suitable weather these
young men wore silk hats as was
appropriate at that time. It was dur
ing this same time that Jim Kisk, as
he was familiarly called, was driving
through New England selling his
goods. Interesting stories In connec
tion with meeting him were told.
There were many anecdotes also told
in connection with these young men.
One returned from a long cold drive
in the fall and as he came into the of-
! flCB
somo asked: "What made his
i
walked up to the
glass, looked it over and said:
"Doubtless It comes from eating so
many red roosters. They have been
tho main diet served since leaving
Connecticut."
In 1839 Judge Norton took his son-in-law,
Mr. Ftmton, into business
with him. Mr. Kenton had previous
ly learned the pottery trade at a red
earthen ware pottery In Dorset.
Judge Norton's son Julius came Into
the firm about the same time. In
1840 Mr. Fenton wished to go into tho
manufacture of a more decorative
Una of ware. Judge Norton did not
care to, but offered no objections to
tlio younger men making the venture
and in the nortli wing of the Norton
pottery, .Mr. Kenton, Julius Norton
and Henry Hall started the manufac
ture of Parian ware. It Is a hard
porcelain and took its name from the
resemblance to Parian marble. They
brought John Harrison from England
to tlo their first modelling.
At the end of a year Mr. Hall with
drew from the firm and Julius Norton
returned with his futher and Edward
Norton. Then Mr. Kcntun with A. P.
Lyman went across the river and
built a pottery on the site of the pres
ent Graded School building. Judge
Norton advancing a certain sum for
tho project. It was known as the U.
S. pottery. Their property exteiidenl
across what is now School street to
the point a little east of the North
Btreet bridge, where the river and lit
t'.n brcok come together. I am told
the first bridge across t lie river on
North street was a covered bridge
and that there are less than six peo
ple In tho village today who rn-all
seeing it. What is now School street
nnd the land to the point were piled
high with slabs and it required what
was described as a small army of men
to draw these slabs down from the
mountains und work them into suit
able lengths for tiring the six kilns.
The first bridge on pottery street was
built for the accommodation of this
pottery.
Workmen came from the Trenton,
N. J., and Norwalk, Ct., potteries and
from abroad. Two artists came from
abroad to decorate the ware and draw
the designs. They were Thcophile
Fry from Belgium or France and
David Greatbaeh. who belonged to
the celebrated English family of
Greatbjchs all of whom were artists.
The hound handled pitcher is his
best known design. A Mr. Farrnr
was their superintendent and under
him Decius Clark.
John Leei and Enoch Barber were
mould makers, Enoch and Thomas
Moore, William and Charles Leek,
John Coughclaw, Stephen Pies, Jos
eph La u ton and Captain Enoch Wood
all worked there, also Lyman Clarke,
Dr. S. R. Wilcox. Mr. G. ii. Sibley, Mr.
Charles Sanford. The ware manufac
tured was Rockingham ware abo a
flint enameled ware, for which Mr.
Fenton took out a patent. It Is simi
lar to Rockingham but harder and
more brilliant in appearance and was
made in three colors, black mottled
with yellow, olive and yellow and
brown and yellow, with red, blue and
green mixed. They also mudo white
granite ware, Parlun ware, and a
littlo soft paste porcelain, and a ware
known as scrodeled or lava ware.
One man mudo stono china bowls on
a flat wheel by the process known as
throwing. The wlieed was worked by
a foot latho and a woman tread the
lathe. Several women were also
employed to decorate the ware as
there was seme porcelain made with
a gilt decoration.
They must also have made some
fire brick as Mrs. E. L. Sibley says
that in tearing down an ash house at
her home, which was formerly the
property of A. P. Lyman, they found
it was lined with a fire brick marked
"B. Fenton, Bennington."
A variety of clays were used in the
manufacture of the ware, some com
ing from New Jersey, some from
South Carolina and a large amount as
ballast in ships coming from abroad,
It being about as cheap to import in
this way as to bring from New Jersey.
The largest piece of ware in exist
ance Is the monumental piece, ten
feet high, which stands on the piazza
between Mrs. W. B. Walker and
Henry Fillmore's homes. This house
was built by Judge Norton in 1838
and made a double house so that his
daughter, Mrs. Fenton, could be near
him.
This monumental piece was dis
played at the Crystal Palace in New
York in 185.'!. It is composed of four
kinds of ware. The base is the lava,
the second section tho Flint enamel,
above this a life sized Parian bust of
-Mr. Kenton surrounded by 8 Rocking
ham columns, and the whole sur
mounted by a parian figure of a wom
an. This piere was Mr. Kenton's idea
and modelled by Greatbaeh. Horace
Greeley in the N. Y. Tribune under
an article called: "Art and Industry
at the Chrystal Palace" gave a lung
description of the Fenton or U. S.
pottery 'display. He said "around
this monumental piece are grouped
table and sc.a.e standards, eorinthlan
capitals, figures, vases, urns, toilet
sets and a great variety of other
specimens of porcelain plain and in
laid. He also mentions telegraph ' in
sulators in white hint anil says:
"This material is one of the best
electric non conductors, that can be
found, and has been employed on the
telegraphs in the vicinity of Bos
ton." Under the Flint enamel he
speaks of pitchers, candle sticks, tea
pets, picture frames, door plates, door
and curtains knobs, escutcheons, etc.
He describes the Parian ware as re
inarkably fine. Silliman and Good
rich's, New York Exhibition of 1853
published by George P. Putnam also
describes this ware. The first at
traction of IT. S. pottery ware is its
quaintness. Tho pieces were more
carefully modelled than most of the
products of other potteries of the
period. The glaze wos more uniform,
brilliant and evenly applied, end had
a rich velvety sheen. Walter A. Dyer
says, "It requires a certiin sort of
ge'iiius to design such fierce lions,
such motherly cows, such jolly
tobies." Today In the Rockingham
ware pitchers, mantle ornaments and
flasks are most sought alter. The or
naments include lions, dogs, cows,
deer and toby jugs. Many flasks are in
the form of books and bore such
titles as, "Departed Spirits." "Van
ished Spirits" and otherc-. Popular
among tho figures was a lion with
fore paw resting on a ball and a
poodle carrying a basket in his
mouth. Among tho pitchers the most
valuable are Greatbachs hound
handled. Tho parian ware was more
costly and was always modelled with
greater care. The pitchers and vases
had raised white figures on a blue,
gray or white back ground. There
were a few poodles made in the
parian ware alio cows, white tobys,
and hound handled pitchers. A fam
ous piece was tho large Niagara Falls
pitcher, tho pattern representing a
cataract flowing over the side to
rocks below. A collection of Ben
nington ware was shown at the Pan
American Exposition in 1001. Since
then it has steadily gained in ltopu
larity. It is now nearly as rare and
valuable ns Lowestoft. In Boston, In
March 1914, a pair of flint enameled
poodles brought $340. That, of
course, was exceptional. At an auc
tion the price depends on the zeal of
the purchasers. The following prices
are quoted by dealers $50 to $100 for
a good lion, $25 to $50 for dogs, cows
and deer, $75 to $150 for white dogs.
Hound handled pitchers $35 to $50,
other pitchers $25 to $35. Candlo
sticks $10 to $15 a pair. The finer
Parian pieces bringing even higher
prices. Members of the old linn
would doubtless open their eyes could
they know the value now placed on
their wares.
The largest collection of United
States pottery is said to bo that made
by Albert II. Pittkin curator of the
Morgan Memorial Museum, Hartford.

Plant Not in Full Operation as Com
pany Has Been Delayed in Se
curing Material.
Like everyone else who is attempt
ing to buy material and machinery
these days, the E. Z. Waist company
is experiencing some difficulty In es
tablishing itself in the new addition
to its plant on Gage street. The ad
dition is partly ready for occupancy
and some cf tho apparatus has been
installed but tho company will not be
In position to fully avail itself of the
additional facilities for some time.
New machinery, some of which Is
in operation, has already begun to re
lieve the forco of a large amount of
hand labor and when the Installation
t is completed tho company will be in
a position to put through a much lar
ger amount on work in shorter time.
In the post the company has been
hampered by tho lack of space and
facilities in the washroom but this
department, which has been moved
into the addition and is partly in op
j oration, is already affording relief.
Tho addition was built with a view
to the comfort and convenience of the
employes. The rooms are high, 14
and 15 feet between floors, and the
I window s are as numerous and as large
' as it was possible to put them in. All
Interior finish is white, adding materi
ally to the lighting and it is the h
tention of the superintendent, Hiram
Hall that they shall be kept as clean
as it is possible to keep a factory.
At the present time the company

in tho branch loctory at Cambridge.
Even with this force it has been un
able to fill Its orders. During the
coming year it Is expected that the
output will bo doubled. To carry out
Its program the company will re
quire an additional force of at least
a hundred. About half this number
will be placed on machines which will
be added and the remainder will be
needed In other departments of the
work. During the present week an
increase of wages amounting to 10
percent in all departments went Into
effect.
has a large collection, included in
this are Beveral pieces loaned by S.
B. Sibley at the time of tho Philadel
phia Centennial in 187t. There is a
collection at tho Metropolitan Muse
um and many fine collections in pri
vate homes, tho largest of which is
that of Mrs. W. B. Walker's which
numbers 175 pieces and of which Ben
ningtcn is justly proud.
Between 1S50 and IStiO the pottery
industries were said to bo the largest
in town employing 300 men. but this
undoubtedly included the men work
ing in wood yards and barns as well
as the turners, moulders and all in
sido workers.
The U. S. pottery went out of exist
anco in I860. The potters going to
Trenton. N. J., Ohio, Illinois and a
fow to Kaoline, South Carolina. In
1870 tho old building was torn down
to make way for the present graded
school building. Many of the old
molds and patterns were stored in
the Norton pottery and the men were
allowed to use them from time to
time, which accounts for many
pieces in the familiar form of U. S.
pottery, but lacking the fine lustre
and coloring.
On a wild winter night in 1873 the
Norton pottery took liro from an over
heated kiln and was burned to the
ground. The moulds and patterns
were a loss which could never be re
placed and prevented tho possibility
of ever returning to the manufacture
of the old line of ware. The office
furniture was nlso destroyed Includ
ing an old desk and high backed rock-
' ing chair brought from the old
lottery on the farm, and al
ways associated with Judge Nor
ton and his father. A loss
often spoken of and much mourned
by the heads of tho firm who
realized to tho full the forco of the
eaylng: "It Is a heart warming and
heart softening thing to associate day
by day, with the belongings of a past
generation."
I The characteristic feature of the
Norton pottery was the time the men
remained with the company, 250 years
Is the combined number of years that
six men made stone ware. Four are
living, C. C. Kimball, John Norton,
i Frederick Godfrey and Frank Green-
; slet. The two who have died aro
IJamrs Williams and Jerome Johnson.
Frank Norton, brother of Edward and
Frederick Hancock were also practl-
cal potters with the firm, going in
j about 1858 to Worcester, Mass.,
where they started a pottery which
had a good output for many years.
' After Mr. Hancock's retirement from
the firm Mr. Norton began tho menu-

Meeting of Trustees in Rutland
December 19 to Name His
Successor.
Col. Thomas Ilannon, who has been
! superintendent of the Vermont sol
diers' home here during the past 15
vears. has resigned because of ill
health.
A meeting of the trustees of the
home will be held at the Bardwell
house In Rutland December 19 to
elect a successor.
Colonel Hannon is a native of
Brattlebcro and veteran of the civil
war. He succeeded MaJ. R. J. Coffey
as superintendent and his manage
ment of the Institution has been ex
ceptionally'aeceptable to the trustees.
In his work Col. Hannon ha3 been ab
ly assisted by Mrs. Hannon as ma
tron. During their residence in Benning
ton, Col. and Mrs. Hannon have made
a large number of close friends. In
case tho superintendent's resignation
results in their removal from the vil

will be received with regret. It is
possible that they may return to their
former home, Etrattleboro, to reside.
facture of' emery wheels. As the
business grew a stock company wa3
formed which is now doing a very ex
tensive business under the firm name
of the "Norton Emery Wheel Co."
Gilbert Burt, still living was anoth
er of the potters and Edward H.
Moore, who afterwards became a
travelling salesman, spending his en
tire' life in the employ of the com
pany. William Bates was alio with
the firm nearly all his life. Patrick
Hogan was custodian of the wood
yard for more than thirty-five years
and never failed to have a spruce
gum stick saved up for the children
of the family even when ten years
had elapsed since their last call.
Mcses and Elizah Greenslet. called
affectionately "Uncle Moses" and
"Undo Lije" by every one in the
pottery, John and Michael Hogan,
who ground the clay and double less
many others would be named if only
some member of the old firm were
here to call them off. After the fire
in 1S73 the Norton company made
nothing but stoneware. Some of the
large urns and flower pots are con
sidered decorative and Mr. Oatman
recommends that they be preserved.
At the time of the Philadelphia
Centennial the company made large
quantities of miniature brown jugs
with the dates 1776-1876 stamped on
them. These were the special work
of John Norton and the firm wished
to send him to Philadelphia at this
time to turn the jugs on a wheel In
the exhibition, but "Johnnie," as he
was called, being a modest man re
fused the honor.
The potter's trade is an exceedingly
difficult one to master requiring four
years of close application. The whole
process is most interesting from the
grinding or tho clay in tho pit, the
mixing in the right proportions, the
throwing and pounding of the piece of
clay till it Is the right texture and
size for the wheel; the skillful shap
ing of the lump of clay on the wheel
till a jar or jug grows as if by magic
under the hand of the expert potter.
Then came the free hand decoration
In cobalt blue drawn on the ware be
fore firing, which also took skill and
in the hands of some men showed
real artistic merit. Tho process of
firing, setting and drawing the kiln
all required greit care and was en
trusted to no novice. The salt glaze
was produced by throwing salt on the
ware in the kiln rhortly before the
kiln was drawn or opened. This vap
orized and penetrated every crack
and crevice. The ware remained in
tho kiln about forty-eight hours. For
the brown glaze used on inside of
jars and for flower pots a special clay
was brought from Albany.
The clay for tho ware came from
Long Island and New Jersey nnd was
mixed In the proportion of two to one
producing a very hard and non porous
ware saiel to be the best on the mar
ket. When potteries began to Bpring
up In the middle west located near
their clay beds, It was found more
and more difficult to compete with
them; for although their clay pro
duced an inferior quality of ware, it
answered for household purposos and
could be sold more cheaply. So te
manufacture was gradually discon
tinued and the old kilns were fired for
the last time.
B. L. Norton, at tho time of his
death, was negotiating with potters
making a different line of ware with
the prospect of manufacturing again.
At this time the firm were doing a
Ifood business In tho wholesaling of
Officials Convinced Plan Hat In
creased Disposition to Save
in Bennington.
The sum of $14,000 will be dlstribut
ed to n. embers of the First National
bank Christmas club this year. The
checks will be distributed to between
300 and 400 people. Such a sum of
money turned over to so many differ
ent persons will help to make the
Christmas season a merry one in
numerous home's In the village and
add materially to the general comfort
of the community.
Ine ChriBtmas club originally was
created for the purpose of enabling
persons to save money through fifty
weeks of the year to be expended In
the purchase of gilts during the last
few days. While this significance has
by no means been lost the idea has
expanded into an easy and attractive
plan of saving money. With the First
National bank all classes of people
have used the plan. Husbands and
wives to surprise members of the
family with Christmas Club checks,
toys and girls too, like to save money
In this way and at the same time they
are getting the "bank habit," an ac
quaintance which may stand them in
good stead later on in life, mill girls
and working people too, use the plan
to accumulate money. Many of them
come in at the noon hour and in such
numbers that it is the 'busiest time
cf all the day In this department.
The bank is glad indeed to number
them among its patrons. Some use
the plan to accumulate a fund for
some special purpose and they find
this method of putting aside a small
sum regularly for fifty weeks a good
way to do It. Many ethers, some of
whom have had - bank accounts for
years, use the plan for some reason
or other, It appeals to them.
And with all, thrift and regularity,
two admiral traits, are cultivated.
The trend is to stability. In true
thrift one not only learns how to save
money but how to use It wisely, how
to spend it to the best advantage.
The club hdps In this respect for
after putting aside for the period of
firty weeks, one is pretty sure to use
care In his or her expenditures of that
money. We believe that some of the
boys and girls in Bennington will be
wearing warmer caps and coats,
shoes and rubbers this winter be
cause of the Christmas Clubs.
The bank people believe In the Idea
and want to encourage it and so will
this month open a 1917 Christmas
Club and allow 3 per cent interest to
all club members who keep up the'r
wekly payments. Under the uni
form weekly payment plan offered by
this bank:

glass and china. The pottery busi
ness was In tho Norton family from
1793 to 1894 and during that time six
Norton men were members of the
firm, John, Luman, Julius, Edward,
Luman P., and Edward L. Norton.
The business card Issued on their ono
hundredth anniversary read ... -
"We start now on our second cen
tury and would ask for a continuance
of your favors for the next ono. hun
dred years
Edward Norton & Co."
The history of the two Bennington
potteries is confused by most of those
who have talked or written ou the
subject. The Norton pottery stands
for length of years and an output of
a substantial and largely utilitarian
character.
The United Stales pottery was lu
existence but a few years but In that
tlmo produced much of artistic merit
and many pieces of great beauty.
Very curiously, however, they have
been little appreciated by many Ben
nington people proving anew the
truth of the old saying "A prophet Is
not without honor save in his own
country."
