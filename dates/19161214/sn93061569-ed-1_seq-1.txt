HONORED AT K. C.
W .H. LINDSEY AND J. A. McCUNE
ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE NA-
" TIONAL ORGANIZATION OF
FARMERS SOCIETY OF EQUITY
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 15, 1916
Mrs. Thompson, Clayton Citizen, Clay
ton, New Mexico.
Annual National Convention Farm
ers Society of Equity convened in
Muehlebach Hotel, Kansas City, today.
Over Sixteen hundred votes cast, W.
H. Lindsey elected on Board of direc
tors; J. A. McCune re-elected, receiv
ing highest number of votes cast. Del
egate, L. H. Morrison doing good work.
H. G. Morris reelected. All will return
Monday. , J. A. McCune.
The above telegram received by the
Citizen, conveys to us the good news
that recognition of the untiring work
of Union county's farmers had been
given at the Annual Convention of the
Farmers Society of Equity, being held
this week in Kansas City.
J. A. McCune who was reelected Sec
retary, is the progressive manager of
the Farmers' Store in Clayton, and
the fact that he received the highest
number of votes cast is simply a just
recognition of his efforts in behalf of
the Society.
W. H. Lindsey, who was elected as
a board member is the president of the
County Organization, has been a very
active worker and through his efforts
a strong society in thjs county has
been built and the foundation laid for
extensive and much greater work for
the future.
L. H. Morrison of the Burnett dis
trict also comes in for honorable men
tion for his activities. He is the dele
gate from the Burnett district. This
district is the one that subscribed
3,000 of the capital stock, which is
being raised for the incorporation of
a large business house for the Society.
H. G. Morris, the live wire, Nation
al Organizer, who has set Union coun
ty afire in the interest of tíie Organi
zation nd wV- has . conducted such
a 8U.c.g8fui campaign, selling stock,
was re-elected. All will return Mon
day. The Farmers Society of Equity is
doing a good work in this locality and
according to reports good work is be
ing accomplished in every locality,
where they are organized. If their
method of doing business is pursued
in the future as is now being done they
will soon become a factor in the bus
iness world, and will be of great bene
fit to the farmers.
CLAYTON PUTTING ON
METROPOLITAN
AIRS
The town of Clayton is surely put
ting on metropolitan airs these days.
At a recent meeting of the board an
ordinance was pnssed providing for
the parking of cars in the center of the
street. Today the new town marshal,
Mr. Kerlin began enforcing the ordi
nance and soon had a long string of
cars, little curs, big cars, old cars, new
cars, yes all kinds of cars lined up in
the middle of the street. This was
sure some sight, and when "Big Mon
day" roll around again it will be'a
greater sight, when all the progress
ive farmers who are owners of Fords
and other makes of cars come to town.
It is our opinion that Clayton can
boast of having more cars thnn any
town in the state, of its size. The
ordinance also provides fo the securing
of teams along the curbing. This is
a splendid provision as it will avoid
accidents caused by run-aways.
Now, when the marshal gets busy
and exterminates some of the super
fluous canines and provides a curfew
for minors, this will surely be a good
ftot:
jdaee in which to live.
MRS. E. D. WIGHT DIES
Following an operation performed
Saturday, Mrs. E. D. Wight. 4R, died
early Monday at the San Rafael hos
ptal. Coming with such suddenness
the death of Mrs. Wight is both a sur
prise and a shock to the entire com
munity. Mrs. Mary Augusta Mitchell Wight
was born in Trinidad and received her
early education in the schools of this
city, finishing a course at the old Till-
-otson Academy, then a preparatory
schoolto Colorado college. On the
eighth of September she became the,
wife of Ed. D. Wight
She was of New England parentage.
She was a member of the Daughters
of the American Revolution and of the
Methodist Episcopal Church South.
Mrs. Wight has been prominently
known in this county since her child
hood. These are surviving her besides her
husband: Mrs. Ruth Wight McKee of
Pueblo, Miss Clara Wight teacher in
the local high school, Gertrude Wight,
head of the domestic science depart
ment of the University of South Da
kota at Vermillion and Kenneth Wight
of this city. Trinidad Advertiser.
Mrs. Wight was a sister of Ed
litchell, one of the most prominent
cattlemen in the county and also of
Mrs. Ed Rucker of Amistad, who pass
ed through Clayton last week on her
way home from Trinidad.
IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE
AT ISAACS HARWARE STORE
X
The Isaacs Hardware Company has
been doing all kinds of improving the
past week. The Clayton Construction
Conmpany built a lot of new shelv
ing and counters for them and now
they are prepared to "sell anybody
anything anytime" as one of their
salesmen put it. The improvement in
appearance is doubled as is also their
ability to display goods. Bob is one
of those enterprising business men
who believes in being a little ahead of
the procession all the time, y

FORMER CLAYTON MAN
ATTENDS CONVENTION
Fred Grimm, Willys-rOverland agent
of Raton, who is one of the 5,000 deal
ers visiting the great Toledo plant in
connection with the immense conven
tion in progress, recounts his exper
iences in this entertaining letter to
the editor: - ;
Some action! r
Nothing was ever so impressive as
our tour of the great plant that turns
out Willys-Overland cft'i .
Our Pullmans all parked in the
company yards. Therywas room, en
ough, for there are sey.n and three
quarter miles of track Within the plant
Each man got a card 'containing a
picture of Mr. Willys and an auto
graphed message of welcome from
him. Next thing I knew we were lin
ed up on the steps of the stunning new
administration building getting photo
graphed. Elevators shot us to the company's
own restaurant on the sixth floor.
There we had a corking breakfast. At
each plate was a copy ot the live new
Willys-Overland bouse, organ "The
Starter," it vieppeá! day's pro
gram. .
Then started our tour of the plant.
Our guides were carefully picked
men. They knew the plant from end
to end, and the parties were small so
that each member of the party could
have his questions answered.
Nobody ought to try to sell Willys
Overland product without knowing
this plant. You can't grip the immen
sity of it till you do.
It is no piker business.
$25,000,000 are tied up in land,
buildings and machinery, not to say a
word about the stock of parts and raw
material.
From the roof of the wonderful ad
ministration building, which stands
out like a state capital, you get a
great panorama of the plant. You
can then readily believe that it occu
pies 103 acres, with 4,486,680 square
feet of floor space in daily use and a
production capacity of 1000 cars per
day.
'ou can appreciate the growth from
250 employes in 1003 to 17,300 in 1916.
1,000 persons, more than the entire
manufacturing force of many a com
pany, work in the administration build
ing alone. This structure, 375 feet
long, has every facility for rapid work,
including dictaphones, its own tele
graph and telephone system and a
mail handling department that docs
about everything but write letters.
388 persons can be fed in the restau
rant at one time.
But this is nothing to what hits
when you cross into the shops. It is a
whirl of action, yet all is system.
Parts by the untold thousands are
here, with a value into the millions
of dollars. There are lines of motors.
I never saw so many crank shafts to
gether. Our guide said 6,000 I'd
have believed 60,000.
There is stock in bins, stock in
yards, stock along the walls, connect
ing rods, frnmes, fenders, mud guavK
hoods, rims, springs, axles, torsion
tubes, transmission gears, shafts,
brake parts, steering rods, pedals, it
is an unending procession.
Every thirty days sees an average
of 1000 tons of steel come. in. It is
handled by a magnetic crane thnt en
ables two men to do a work that form
erly required thirty.
There are amazing machines.
The toggle press, for example, held
us all. This monster, with its pressure
of 1000 tons, shapes cold steel like car
board. A piece of metal fed to it
comes oi$ as a side frame. It can
make 2000 of these in an eight hour
day.
Other mighty machines stamp out
radiator shells, fenders, cowl dashes
and doors.
You take off your hat to the drop
forging machines. Down comes the
hammer and the fiery piece of iron is
beaten into shape. The complete drop
forging of the front axle can be ac
complished with one heat.
Every kind of part requiring
strength, was drop forged, while we
looked on, axles, crank shafts, brake
assembly rods, brake and control rods,
spring shackles, gear blanks and brake
rod SsJrs. .
We saw the company's accurate
system of dye making. It calls for a
special workman on each detail. One
works on the shaper, another on the
planer and a third on die sinking.
The multiple spindle drill in one op
eration drills all the holes in the front
axle. This a guarantee that each will
be in right relation to the other.
It was hard to drag us away from
the automatic turret lathe that sur
faces and finishes fly wheels. It works
as though somewhere within its metal
vitals a brain was concealed. The
workman has only to put on the rough
fly wheel, adjust the first set of tools,
push the lever, and let the machine do
the rest.
The cast iron is pci-led off as readily
as wax. Sometimes four or five op
erations are performed at once. When
one set of cuttings is done, the ma
chine stops automatically, and the
next set of tools comes automatically
into place. Twenty operations are
porformed in fourteen minutes. 26
pounds of metal are removed from the
wheel. One man can watch three of
these machines.
The vertical cutter of gears on fly
wheels almost matches the turret lathe
in interest
Moving up and down, the cutter at
the sametime slowly revolves, the fly
whee turning in the opposite direc
tion. By the time a complete revolu
tion of the fiy wheel has béen accom
plished, all the gears are cut.
We all fell for the aluminum foun
dry and for the machines that finish
the aluminum parts.
The multiple spindle drill bores 81
holes in the crank case in one opera
tion. This is a proof of the superior
ity of machine processes, for the holes
must be in the right relation to each
other.
Another machine smooths the sur
faces of the crank cuse:'., finishing sev
en in nine minutes. '
Diamonds, real d'nn onds, are con
sumedwith Bppnr'nl !y reckless indif
ference in the wet grind room. Placed
in small tools they are used to true
the emery wheels on which are ground
the bearing surfaces of the crank
shafts.
They are nought in ? 1 .5,000 lots.
We looked on while whole forests of
lumber were being turned into bodies
in the work department. This lumber
comes in by carloads. As 214 feet of
wood ish required on a small touring
car, we could readily see why so much
was required.
You make this round and you can
understand this company's immense
consumption of material 18,000,000
pounds of solder annually, 2,500,000
pounds of tin and lead for smoldering,
10,000,000 pounds of brass and copper,
12,000,000 feet of steel tubing and
125,000 tons of steel.
But what impressed me more than
all was the department in which ma
terials are tested. They have to know
a thingi s right before it goes into a
Willys-Overland car. Tha's how they
safeguard the public.
Tests in the physical and chemical
laboratories are made in two ways.
Completed steel parts are subjected to

combination and - we predict great
success for them.

home the latter part of last week from
Mineral Wells where they have been
for the past few weeks.
OPINION ON RABBIT
DRIVE DIFFERS
THE USE OF GUNS AND DOGS
ADVOCATED BY SEVERAL IN
TERESTED IN DRIVE. PRECAU
TION MUST BE USED
There seems to be a diversity of
opinion regarding the use of guns and
dogs in the big rabbit drive, which
will be held on December 27. In an
interview with H. J. Hilgers, he ex
pressed it as his opinion, that owing
to the fact that there would be a scar
city of men, it would be advisable to
use shot guns and dogs, but that the
use of fire arms should be under the
direction of the captains, who would
prohibit their use when a suiTicient
number of men arrived to make the
use of clubs instead .ncccssnry.
This, we believe, is a very food sug
gestion. It must be realized, however,
tlie.t the use of fire arms in a gather
ing of this kind is hazardous and it
will demand the exercise of extreme
caution on the part of the captains
to -estrict them to their proper use."
There seems to be an increos-'ni in
terest taken in this drive and the peo
ple of the adjoining districts are mak
ing preparations for it. "
There will be an unlimited amount
of sport connected with the drive and
should it he a success and a large num
ber of rabbits killed the whole com
munity will profit thereby.
Now let everybody get. behind the
move and make it a success, but use
all precaution that no senious accident
may mar the pleasure of the day. Let
us have other opinions on the subject.
