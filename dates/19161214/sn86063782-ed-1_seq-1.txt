GERMANY OFFERS TO MAKE
PEAlE
Her Terms Will Hardly Suit Allies?
If Accepted Nations Would Retain
Former Possessions.
New York Dec. 13?It was learned
in this country yesterday that Germany
had submitted certain terms of peace
and while no official account of these
terms have been received yet, the following,
it is claimed this mornng, is the
substance of the proposals made to
the Allies by Germany:
For the complete restoration of
Belgium.
For the evacuation by Germany
of all territory captured in northern
France during the progress of the war.
For the establishment of Poland
and Lithuania as independeht kingdoms.
For the retention of Serbia by
Austria Hungary, and the restoration
to Bulgaria of all territory lost
by that country in the second Bal
kan war.
For the restoration to Austria of j
territory captured by Italy in the i
neighborhood of the Adriatic sea.. I
For the restoration to Germany
of all her colonial possessions in j
Africa, the far east and other parts
of the globe. i
For the retention of Constant!- <
nople by Turkey. i
This information was obtained today
from an unquestionable authority
close to the Germau embassy. <
According tto (embassy lofficin^
who have kept fully advised of the 1
situation, the terms laid down rep-,1
resent the united power of all of the t
central powers and were drawn up t
after full exchanges of views l?e- j
tween the Teutonic capitals.
It is stated that no definite information
has been received by
these powers which would lead
them to believe that the entente nations
are prepared to accept them, or even
to discuss them. The prime purpose
of the central powers in putting them
forth at this time it was learned from
author!titave sources, it to "smoke
out" the enemy governments and to j
acquaint the inhabitants of Germany,
Turkey and Bulgaria with a Kuowl- 1

for three reason:
First. That the recent victories
of the central powers in the Balkans
has demonstrated from the Teutonic
viewpoint that these powers
cannot be crashed; that the war
might go on for ten years more with
neither side arriving any closer to
a complete victory over the other.
Second. That with the approach
of winter, military operations for
the next three months will be practically
at a 8tandstil, with the nar
tlons involved in the war compelled
to see about organizing new spring
and summer vimpaigns.
Third That the upheaval in the
British cabinet due to a popular
mistrust ]of that governmentV conduct
of the war, may induce the
public of Great Britain and her allied
nations to realize the hopelessness
of carrying the struggle further.
According to the views expressed
in German embassy quarters there
vprv little likelihood thnt the TTnited
States government will be asked to
take a leading part in bringing
about a conference between represen- (
tatives of the warring powers, or 1
that such a conference would be held
in this "ountrv. It Ls assumed in '
thef^ quarters that any confereuce of
it9 kind would be held at Berne.
Switzerland, or at the Hague.

(After the Journey.)
When he went home, who went the
other day,
There was an eager scamper of wee
feet
To welcome him, and faces small and
sweet i
Uplifted, and bright eyes, blue, brown
and gray,
Danced with delight as only child-eyes
may
When Joy is overflowing and complete;
And he was crowded on a some shady
seat,
Both knees, both arms, filled in the
old-time way.
"Tell us a 'torv!" "Say a rhyme again!"
"Oh, Little Orphant Annie, please,
once more!"
"No, Old John Henry!" "No, The
Raggedy Man!"
Was it not so, O best-beloved of men?
You cannot answer from the farther
whore,
But so, I know, your first day
home began.

From Lord Roberts to Hugh Scott tj,
Great Britain has expended in this h<
var an almost Incalculable treasure, lit
She lnjh sacrificed by the kiutvlred l'?
thousand the lives of her bravest 01
and best. She has piled ui>on the t0
shoulders of her people a colossal war |lg
lebt under which they must stagger
'or generations to come. In spite" of es
ill these dreadful sacrifices she has ov
>f her foes is darker now-.then ever, p*
She does not know whether she is to w
.'merge alive from this ordeal of whetli- lu
?r tlie British Empire is on the verge of ai
lismemberment and disolutlon.
AVhy? The answer is very simple.
These things have happened because in
he years before the war th popl of Or '
?at Britain rejected the advice and wer jn
le afto the pleading of Lord Roberts jt
ind the other great yupunnff :oinqfTj.. re
ind the other clearsighted men who urg tv
?d day in and day out that Great Britai Ir
<hould do as all the other great powers ra
ihd done and adopt a system of uni- 111
rersal service. Sf
rji
Had Robert's advieee lieeen taken
:here would probably have been no ar 'for
(Jrinany would have Iweu the hope OI
essness of it. And of the ar had come, m
It wowuhl never have followed the
. nurse which it has followed. If as
England had had universal service, ai
iuch for instance as France had. she h<
jould have thrown a million trained ^
'.ml equipped men across the Channel
Q(
in the early days. The German drive
ould have been stopped before it had ^
gotten fairly started, for experience k]
cas proved that on the western front, q,
vhere the flanks cannot be turned, ade- (j,
ipiately manned defensive lines can
je held against every assault That is
the lesson of Verdun and of the ?
Somme.
If a British army of a million had
been instantly available at the outset,
to assist the superb but outnumbered
army of France, the Germans would
never have swept clear across Belgium
and deep into Northern France. They
might well have been stopped before
they had overrun half of Belgium,
Antwerp would probably bave been
saved, the grleat imn-beariug lands
of France ould probably not have
fallen Into the hands of the enemy,
Germany would now he established
on the Belgian coast as a deadly
menace to England, the Western
Allies would not have to sacrifice
nearly a million brave soldiers in a
vain effort to oust the invader because
they would never be able t?> carry out
his invacasion.
All these reflections coneerning what
might have been had the people of
Great Britain adopted universal service
before the war came many seem
barren and profitless. Perhaps they
are. But Gen. Hugh G. Scott, the
American chief of staff and the American
soldier whose judgement the people
of this country hold in highest
esteem, has just urged in his annual
report the adoption of a system of
universal service by the United States
as the only means of securing an adequate
national defence. Perhaps Jt
- l a rt-ill
may neip a nine u win .....
reflect that what Britain has suffered
and Ls suffering Ls tlie result of her
refusal to do what General Scott is
now urging us to do.
