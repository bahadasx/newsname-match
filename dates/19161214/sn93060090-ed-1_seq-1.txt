PAPER
I
HIGHER, j
The price of print puper is
going bighei and higher. WUere
it w?li stop no one knos.
Many of the smaller papers
have been forced to suspeml
business and many more will
have to follow the wreakage un
less the subscription price is
raised to meet conditions. It is
not our desire.to nise the sub
scription price tf the CRESSET.
It is almoist exclusively a mis
sionary paper in the interest
and upbuilding of Christianity,
an institution I love and cherish
for its influence for good and the
broad christian principles em
bodied in its government and
daily practi'ce-lpf its 'GodMike
friendship. it would rather
have one hundred thousand
readers at 25 cents each than
fifty thousand at 50 cts. each,
While the paper and mailing
would cost a little more, the
possibilities for doing good
would be so much greater, that
it would outweigh the difference
in cost. So help us get subscriptions.
WAR Depart-ment.
The Germans have Armored
car. A great improvement over
the British "Tank ' Difficult to
destroy it carries a crew of ten
men and travels at the rate of 25
miles an hour.

Rumanian armies is continued,

effort xo check the advance of
invading force.
U. S. Protests in Belgium's
behalf, results may "seriously
embarrass German Government'
Who wants rar? Men who
have selfish rights to protect,
We do not want wax, we want
peace at all times, at all places
and every where,
