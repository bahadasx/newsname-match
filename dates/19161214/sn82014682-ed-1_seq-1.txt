ANXIOUS FATHER HUNTS
FOR BOY HIT BY AUTO
l This is one of the most noted cases
in legal annals and has been fought
out in American courts for the past
several years. The case arose over
charges that another baby was substi
tuted for little "Teddy" Slingsby, son
of Lieut, and Mrs. C. R. Slingsby and
heir to $500,000 property of the Slings
by family in Yorkshire, England. The
substitution was alleged to have been
made in San Francisco. The : claim
was made that the real Slingsby baby,
wnicn was born in San Francisco on
September 1. 1910. died and that the
mother substituted another infant.
After the case had been thrashed
out In San Francisco, the. evidence
was submitted to the probate court
in London, which on February 3, 1915,
decided that the present Sllngsby
baby is legitimate and that no sub
stitution was made. Sir Edward Car
son, Unionist leader, has been leading
counsel ror the contestant of
child's right to the estate.
The little son of R. B Reedy of
the tax office was hit this morning on
Waialae road near Sixth avenue. Kal
muki, by an automobile driven by Mrs.
Samuel I. Johnson,vwho was driving
her own son to school. The Reedy
boy was standing at the road side
with several companions, according to
Mrs. Johnson, and darted out sudden
ly In front of her after once going
to one side. The injured law at once
rushed to the ; Beretania sani
tarium by Mrs. Johnson, where it was
found that two ribs were broken and
several bruises and cuts of a minor
nature sustained.
The Injured boy's father was in
formed of the accident shortly after it
occurred and spent a frantic hour and
a half telephoning and going to the
various hospitals and doctors' offices
before he finally located his son.
Mrs. Johnson not only rushed the
boy to the hospital but reported the
occurrence to the police and did every
thing possible for the youngster. It
appears that the lad had rushed back
to the road for his top. Mrs. Johnson
had warned a erouD of children br
