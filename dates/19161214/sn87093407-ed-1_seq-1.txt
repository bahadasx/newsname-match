U P. Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Dec. 14.—Senti
ment increased today in favor
of Including In England's an.
swer to the German peace a
clear and explicit definition of
the allies' basic term*.
it it certain the answer will
be a rejection of the proposal
at this time, but it is felt In
many quarters that the allies
should meet the German diplo
matic strategy in sending the
note by a counter move, which
would put the allies as the
first of the two sides to make
known definite demands and
concessions.
The Pall Mall tiazette's comment
was typical today of this view It
said:
"We do not see why the nllies
should not turn the Incident to
their profit by a fresh and vigorous
proclamation of the fundamentals
of our own cause and the condi
tions without which they felt
bound to regard any sort of peace
a mere springboard for a still more
terrible conflict. It Is tin unique
opportunity to acquaint the whole
world with the real Issues.
"The essence of the allies' an
swer must necessarily be that
peace without justice is Immoral
and peace without safety, la a
mere delusion."
After the first shock of the news
of Germany's peace plan and th>
first and Instantaneous decision to
reject it, there came today with a
strengthening of this determination

Tho C.erman communication to

This action completely fulfilled
the request the lentral empires
made on the \ nited States.
In this connection it was learned
that this government has instituted
a series of "confidential soundings"
in all belligerent capitals, to deter
mine, if possible, the disposition of
the various governments toward
consideration of peace at this time
The first returns from these in

The state department said official

that this government is ready to

without the necessity of making
any definite offer to do so.
