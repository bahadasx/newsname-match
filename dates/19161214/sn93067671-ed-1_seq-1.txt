A Good Place
The Pickens Drug Company has for
several years wanted the agency for
.Huyler's candy and has at last secured
it. This has been difficult, as the Huy
ler people do not like to put their goods
in small towns. This candy has about
the best reputation of any candy in the
land.
The Pickens Drug Company has a
stock of Christmas goods this year that
will rival many city stores. They are
trying to keep trade at home and will
appreciate it ever so much if you will
give them a chance. J. N. Hallum, the
manager, says that the line of jewelry
they carry has been bought from the
same house for six years and has given
splendid satisfaction. They carry the
goods all the time and replace any filled
or plated goods that fail to give satis
faction. These occasions are very rare.
'hey are especially strong on solid gold
goods and have a nice line of same.
Here's hoping that you will trade with
home people and helip make the people,
the town and the county what you would
have them be.---Adv.
Supervisor Craig is having a ware
house and shed built for the county just
behind The Sentinel office.

Valuable Property to Be Sold
We are sure you will read, without
o-.r calling attention to it, the land sale
advertisement on another pa e of this
paper which advertises for sa ie all the
real estate owned by T. D. Harris in
Pickens. All this valuable property
will be sold at public auction Dec. 20.
and it will be the biggest auction sale
ever, held in Pickens. You may get
particulars about the sale by reading
the page advertisement.
The Greensboro Realty and Auction
Co. has charge of the sale and they say
that Mr. Harris has turned the proper
ty over to them with instructibns tosell
it to the highest bidder regardless of
the price and they intend to sell it that
way. It is useless for us to speak of
the value of the property, as everybody
knows it to be among the mostval uable
in the county.
As Mr. Harris never tells anybody his
gersonal plans we do not know them,
ut we gather from what he says that
he will continue to make Pickens his
home. le says he likes the town which
has so many sacred associations for him
ahd he wants to see it grow; that he
owns more property than he can give
his >ersonal attention to and improve
and le has decided to sell his Pickens
property to individuals who will im
prove it and help the old town grow.
An immense crowd is expected to be
here for the sale. Prizes will be given
away and a mighty good band will be on
hand to make music grand when they
sell the land. Make your arrangements
now to be here Wednesday, December
20.
