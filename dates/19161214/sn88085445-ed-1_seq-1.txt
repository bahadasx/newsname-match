Pensions For Teachers Justified on Social
and Economic Grounds
By Dt. JOSEPH SWAIN. President Swarthmore Coßege
THE justification of pensions for teachers is economic, social and edu
cational. Economically the work of an organization is not effective
unless there is a satisfactory method of retiring aged or infirm
workers.
IT IS UNJUST TO SUCH WORKERS TO RETIRE THEM WITHOUT
CONSIDERATION. iT IS UNJUST TO THE ORGANIZATION TO CON
TINUE THEM WHEN THEIR WORK HAS BECOME INEFFECTIVE.
Only a satisfactory pension system can prevent either tho dismissal
of aged or infirm teachers without resources or the sacrifice of tho wel
fare of the pupils in order to continue the employment of teachers who
are no longer capable of good work.
Socially men and women of character, intelligence nnd devotion nre
willing to "perform difficult social services that are poorly paid, but it is
too much to expect them also to face old age aud disability without the
prospect of protection. Educationally there is great need to secure and
retain able teachers in the schools.
At present only about five per cent of the men and fifteen per cent of
the women who enter teaching make it a permanent career. For these
reasons the development of pension systems for teachers is becoming
more rapid. MORE THAN HALF OF OUR STATES NOW HAVE
SOME FORM OF TENSIONS FOR TEACHERS.

BUTTER DROPS 3 CENTS:
NEW PRICE STILL HIGH
Butter dropped back three cents
a pound Thursday, the exact amount
of its advanoe the week previously,
and now rests at 40 cents. In suite
of the drop, the present price Is
still one cent above local prices of
previous years.
The. cause of the three cent ilron
's ascribed to the falling off ol" con
sumption, and the effects of a boy
cott on high food products establish
ed by Seattle consumers.
But a small supply of storage
better now remains on the Seattle
market, aad when this is gone,
dairymen look for prices to go hack
again to the former height, and
ntobably beyond that point.
Dairymen at Mt. Vernon met Sat
urday in tin endeavor to force the
conde v series to pay the higher
prices. The call for the meeting
was as follows: "Europe must
have our milk. Present prices pay
no profit. We must have $2.50 per
hundred."
