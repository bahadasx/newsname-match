MEANS BEGINNING
OF INTERVENTION
Expedition Into Mexico To Capture
Villa
I
Be
Threats Made Mexicans Will Rise
In Arms Against U. 8,
Washington, March 13. The con
viction Is growing In official circles
hero that the American expedition
Into Mexico to capture Villa means
the beginning of Intervention.
Uoporto of a decidedly disturbing
character concerning the attitude of
tho Carranza government are begin
ning to arrive here. Throughout these
reports tho threat nppears that within
twenty-four hours after tho expedi
tion has got well under way all Mex
ico -will bo In arms against the United
States.
Wliat attitude Carranza personally
assumes appears from tho reports to
to negligible. With nls government
already tottering, It Is declared that
any prorilfeo of noninterference or
co-openit'on which he may inako are
unlikclj o hind his followers.
Itumorb of plots among these fol
lowers to overthrow him have been
rcaoklug the state department in In
creasing number. Talking privately,
those through whose hands these re
ports have passed expressed fiio view
that on of two things is going to hap
pen. Either Carranza will find him
self for"'d bv -popular opinion to re-

elst tho invasion, or his followers will
ignore him and lead the resistance.
Thoro Is growing suspicion that
Obregon is said to have given ear to
tho suggestion that he himself could
to In Carranza's plnce. Private ad
vices from tho border received here
describe American refugees arriving
at EI Paso from Chihuahua City as
declaring that the Carranza garrison
thero has taken up the cry of "Death
to the Grlngoes." Carranza officials
are declared to have openly stated
that American troops will not bo per
mitted to pass through the town.
The Impression that the movement
to get Villa means Intervention has
spread to congress. At the capital
tho determination oxlsts to stand by
tho preslrtont, whatever comes, liy
many of the senators and representa
tives tho feeling has long existed Oat
Intervention In Mexico is Inevitable.
As further indications of tho appre
hension hero it was learned that
within the past twenty-four hours or
dero have gone forth from the treas
ury department to customs ofllclals
along the border to make the embargo
egalnst the shipment of arms, am
munition and other explosives to VU-
"V. C . ,'
Resisted
llsta forces apply to all consignees
across tht bonier. Heretofore the
customs officers have been permitted
t( make exceptions, with approval of
the treasury department, of shipments
or armB and ammunition to Carranza
forces and of dynamite to mining
companies. For the next two or three
days at least no exceptions at all will

CARRANZA ISSUES DECREE
Will Resist Invasion Unless Granted
Reciprocal Privilege.
Mexico City, .March lS.x-Ganeral
Carranza issued a manifesto to tho
ration declaring that under no clrcum
r.tanciis would the Mexican govern
ment grant the right to the United
Statis to violate Mexican territory, by
sending in an armed force In pursuit
cf Villa without consent and the re
ciprocal privilege being observed and
admitted. Word was 3ent to the con
Udenttal agent of the Mexican govern
ment In Washington to make immedi
p.fo representations to this effect. Gen
eral Carranea says in his manifesto;
"I am sure that I Interpret In this
nintler tho national sentiment and
that the Mexican people will comply
In a dignified manner with their duty,
be the sacrifices what they may, to
sustain their rights and sovereignly
if, unfortunately, this drags us into a
war a war which the United States
can nover justify. We will not be re
sponsible for the disastrous conse
quences. Upon the heads of the
traitorous Mexicans, who within and
without this country have labored to
produce this result, will fall the Inex
orable Justice of the people."
MEXICAN SITUATION
STIRS UP CONGRESS
Completion of National Defense
Plans Will fie Hastened.
Washington, March 13. That the
military activity in Mexico will serve
to hasten the completion of tho de
fense plans of the administration is
admitted, even by the stauchest pa
cifists in congress.
Chairman Hay of the house military
committee Is anxious to get the calen
dar cleared promptly so that he can
lay his bill before the house for ac
tion. Before it is taken up, however,
tho repeal of the free sugar provision
of the tariff law, and tho Immigration
bill with its modllied literacy test,
must bo disposed of. Iloth probably
will be passed this week.
Tho connUs, having passed tho
Shields water power bill and cleared
the calendar of many small bills, is
getting ready to vote on the Tillman
government armor plate bill by March
21. In the meantime there is expect
ed to be intermittent discussion of the
measure, while appropriation bills are
awaited from thn house.
Congressional leaders hope to make
rapid progress with Important domes
tic business nt hand, particularly the
appropriation bills. For a few days
at least the houso expects to have tho
army reorganization bill before It.

Colonel Herbert J. Slocum, com
mander of the Thirteenth cavalry,
who was in charge at Columbus, N.
M., when the attack was made by
the Mexican bandits under Villa, has
held his present- rank, since Aug. 2,
1912. Colonel Slocum's father is Col.
J. J. Slocum, executor of Russell
northern Mexico, also admitted that
he was gathering a number of young
Mormons familiar with northern- Mex
ico to use as scouts for the United
States.
This and the packing of the Slxtu
and Sixteenth infantry regiments, in
Camp Cotton in the southern part of
E Paso, were the only indications
here of preparations for an invasion
of Mexico, Their destination is kept
a 'secret, but it was said on good au
thority thnt their first movement at
least Is not to enter Mexico, but to
take a position on the border nt some
point west of here. At the headquar
ters of General Pershing It was ox
plained that their movement "is for
the purpose of strengthening the bor
der patrol." ,
At Fort Bliss the Eighth cavalry
and the mountain batteries of the
Fourth Field artillery are making ar
rangements to move. The Seventh In
fantry surrendered all its wngon
eculpment to the Eighth cavalry, mak
ing it certain that this regiment of In
fantry Is not to leave here.
'DEATH TO GRINGOES"
Cry of Carranza Soldiers Stationed at
Chihuahua City.
Washington, March 13. Growing
distrust exists In olllcial circles here
concerning the attitude which the
Carranza government will assumo to
wards the American expedition into
Moxico to capture Villa. Uuofllc'.al
dispatches received here quoted Amer
ican refugees arriving at El Paso
from Chijiuaaim City aB stating that
Carranza soldiers there wero going
about thp city shouting "Death to the
Gringoes." Aboift fifty Americans are
said to bo at Chihuahua City.
Other dispatches from tho border
said the Cnrrnnza authorities at
Juarez were declaring that no Ameri
can forces would be permitted to go
through'that city.
Partial confirmation was obtained
from officials bore o! reports that an
embargo has been placed along tho
'coder aguinst shipments of arms to
Carranzlstas as well as Villlsta forces
In Mexico. These reports state that
tho custom ofllclals nro not even per

Reports multiplied here that Fran
cisco Villa is disintegrating his force
ot 1,500 to 2,500 men whom he used to
support or to make tho Columbus
raid.
American military authorities said
that it is possible that it would have
been advisable to go after Villa Thurs
day when his raiders flow southward.
They were then demoralized and were
dropping loot and war material be
fore the attacks of flfty-nlno men un

Washington, March 13. Secretary

dent concerning the proposal of the
Carranza government that Carranza
troops bo permitted to cross Into
American territory when pursuing
Villa. It Is probable that tho pro
posal will be accepted In modified
form.

WILSON CONSIDERING PROJECT
Troopers From Ohio, New York, Penn
cylvanla, Michigan and Illinois, All
Regarded as Crack Regiments. Like
ly to Be Selected For the Mission.
Army Officer Directs Attention to
Scarcity of Mounts.
Washington. March 13. President
Wilson Is seriously considering the
advisability of calling out five regi
ments ot national guard cavalry to go
tr the border to do patrol duty there
In place of the regular soldiers who
are being sent Into Mexico in pursuit
ot Villa.
In case toe president calls on the
national guard cavalry, regiments
from New York, Pennsylvania, Michi
gan, Ohio and Illinois, all regarded as
"crack" regiments, will be chosen for
patrol duty at the beginning. In alL
likelihood Infantry regiments in Tex
as, New Mexico and Arizona will be
called on also. Each of these states
has a complete regiment of infantry
ready for Eervice. Texas, in addition
to the regiment of infantry, has three
troops of cavalry it can furnish. There
are approximately sixty-five men la
each troop.
' la case the national guard regi
ments are sent to the border their
service will be confined to American"
soil unless a general war with all fac
tions In Mexico results. In that event;
under tin terms of the Hay act, which
was passed at the time of the taking
of Vera Cruz two years ago, the na
tional guard regiments will be offered,
an opportunity to enlist as a body In.
the volunteer army. Should war en
sue and should they enlist, the regi
ments which are being sent to taet
border are most likely to see service
in Mexico earlier than other militia,
oi volunteer organizations.
Officers of the war department toolc
occasion to point out how the devel
opments In Mexico during the last
week have emphasized the necessity
or obtaining an adequate national'
guard legislation before the end of."
the present session. "The president
Is said to want five regiments o cav
alry," said one officer, "but the na
tional guard can not furnish these rep
iments at present as they should take
the field."
Another officer of the army pointed
out that in the plans for the use ot
the national guard now, and especial
ly for the future, pains should be tak
en to Inhere a sufficient supply o'
I mounts. "The Mexican campaign." he
paid, "is going to be Harder on horses
than men. The army at the present
, time has only about enough horses for
Its own men. Thero are nowhere near
enough on hand for the national guard
cavplry regiments, or for a volunteer"
cava'rv. In cae one Is organized f
fear It w'l1 1p difficult to obtain suffi
cient l-or" of the proper kind.
Agents of the allies have purchased:
practically everything available for
service "
