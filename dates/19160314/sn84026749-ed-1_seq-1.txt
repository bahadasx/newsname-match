ure. Tho President says ho ngrecrf with
Mr. Kent Uiat "It Is better to let tho

self In detail about tho whole water
bill there were provisions aimed at per
sonal use. Theso are eliminated by tho
amendments.
Eenator Sheppard said this afternoon
that It was the oblect of the amend
ments he proposed to restrict tho bill
so it would not extend to personal U'o
or shipment for personal use. and that
all worthy objections to the original
till from the medical or scientific or
mechanical standpoint had been met.
As the bill will stand amended, tho
proposed prohibition will apply to llci
uoi "for bevcrago purposes or for any
other than scientific, medicinal, phar
maceutical, mechanical, sacramental,
or other non-beverage purposes."
The character of the bill. It U point
ed out. Is materially changed by the
amendments proposed today. Not only
Is the personal use of liquor not inter
fered with, but the bill is made pri
marily a mcasuro to stop traffic in Ha
uor as a beverage, and nothing more
than that
It Is the belief of the supporters of
the bill that It will gain moro votes In
Congress in the amended form than In
the original form.
Language of New rr--.;urc.
Section one of the bill amended will
read after the enacting clause:
'What on and after tho first day of
November, Anno Domini, 1916, no per
son or persons, or any house, com
pany, association, club or corporation,
his its or their agents, officers, clerks
or servants, directly or indirectly. In

or receive orders for the purchaHO of
any alcoholic or other prohibited
liquors for beverage purposes or for
any other purpose than scientific, me
dicinal, pharmaceutical, mechanical,
sacramental or other non-beverage
purposes.
"Wherever the term 'alcoholic liquors'
is used In this act It shall be deemed to
include whisky, brandy, rum, gin, wine,

Shortage of Officers At
Verdun Worries Germans
I3NDON, March 14. A shortage of
officers duo to recent hfavy losses at
Verdun, is causing tho German general
staff much worry, according to Itomo
dttpatches.
All' acrman otflcers under the rank
of captain, now In tho Balkans, have

Over Two Hours' Debate.
An agreement was Anally reached that
there shall be two hours and a half of
debate on the Borland substitute. This
will bring the Houio to a vote about 4
o'clock this afternoon.
Chairman Crisp's ruling came after an
exhaustive parliamentary discussion as
to tho status or the Borland substitute.
Congressman Mondell, who raised the
point of order, contended that the Bor
land substitute was divisible; that Mr.
Borland could not link to a proposition
for a 10 nor cent reduction In force.
which might be in order, the Holman
rule, a proposal for an eight-hour dKy,
which was not In order.
Chairman Crisp, concluding nis ruling
said:
"If you reduce tho number of clerks,
It is apparent that the business will re
aulro those remaining In tho service to
work longer. Therefore, the chair
thinks that the legislative part of the
amendment .naturally follows that
which reduces the number of clerks. t
Why Point Was Overruled.
"The Chair thinks that the Holman
rule Is Intended to have beneficial ef
fect upon tho Treasury, and the Chair
thinks that If he Is in doubt about this
matter the doubt should bo resolved
asrnlnst tho nolnt of order.
"By resolving this doubt against the
point of order the Chair works no.

The State Department is advised that a special

COLUMBUS, N-. M., March' 14. Under the personal
direction of Brig. Gen. J. J. Pershing, conqueror of the
Moros in the Philippines, organization of the main Ameri
can division to invade Mexico in pursuit of Villa began
here today.
Col H. J. Slocum, who repulsed Villa in the Colum
bus raid, was appointed to command the "flying squad
ron' 'of cavalry, which is expected to comprise the larger
part of the armed forces to enter Mexico sauth of here.
To investigate reports that the Carranza mobilization
at Palomas, in the direct line of the contemplated pursuit,
may be planning opposition, General Pershing arranged a
conference with General Bertani, the Carranza command
?nt, today.
The two commanders will meet on American soil.
EXPECT ORDER ON THURSDAY.
General Pershing is keeping in close touch with de
velopments at Palomas. Carranza re-enforcements under
General Gutierrez, reported en route overland from Guz
man to join Bertani's men, have not yet been sighted by
the border patrols.
There is a marked conviction among the rank and file
that the order to enter Mexico will come on Thursday.
Officers will not discuss it. Privates do not know. There
are enough forces and supplies here today for an earlier
dash, if ordered.
General Pershing evidently is awaiting re-enforcements.
More cavalry and signal aero corps are due today.
Troop trains carrying the engineers, aviators, and sig
nal corps from Fort Sam . Houston, Tex., have passed
through El Paso and are believed to be headed for Co
lumbus. The train is reported to have carried six aeroplanes,
which are io be used for scouting. They are to be set up
immediately on their arrival.
What looked suspiciously like an attempt at a real cen
sorship was the close scrutiny specially detailed officers
gave all messages leaving the telegraph office here. After
this was noticed the correspondents used the telephone to
El Paso.
Troop trains are noticeably scarce in arriving, al
though it is known that soldiers of all branches have left
a half dozen different interior posts on rush orders.
Freight trains are unloading tons of canned goods,
hav'for the horses, and boxes labeled "handle with care."
