Another Advance In
Sugar Is Expected
i Salt Lako, March 11. Tho meteor
ic rlso In sugar prices continued on
tho New York, market and in all
probabl'ity another fifteen cents will
bo added to tho prices. Tho closing
quotations on the Now York market
yesterday wcro $0.45 a hundred on
beet sugar and $0.53 on enno suRar.
Local manufacturers and dealers hud
no official ndvlco last night as to a
further Increase, but such word Is
expocedTTrircomes,bect sugaf-uc
the market will bo about $7.05 a
hundred nnd enno sugnr $7.15 In cur
lead lots to Jobbers only.
The shortage of tho sugar crop In
Cuba this season and practically a
total elimination of tho European
crop la said by thc sugar manufac
turers nnd dealers to havo created an
cxtcnslvo world shrlnkago of sugnr
for 101C. Tho shortnge coupled with
thn excessive sea transnortntlou rates
from Cuba, Is given as tho cuuso for
the meteoric rise of sugar prices dur
ing tho past few weeks. To the ac
tivity of EngUsh brokers is attribut
ed tho additional ndvanco yesterday.
It is roported that buyers from Grent
Britain yesterdny purchased 50,000
tons of Cuban sugar.
Tho steady and rapid advanco of
sugar prices has caused constoi na
tion among tho housewives of the
country, and in many cities throuKh
out tho country n boycott against the
product has been declared by the
Housewives leagues. A similar move
ment has been started by tho House
wives' leaguo of Salt Lako and a
meeting of the organization will bo
held at tho Y. W. C. A. rooms at
2:30 next Wednesday afternoon to
voto on tho question.
In caso tho boycott Is voted upon
favorably tho members of tho leaguo
will at onco Instltuto n- campaign
against the uso of sugar in tho homes
until such a timo as tho prlco is"
deemed onco moro within reason. If
Is planned In caso tho boycott Is do
inrn,i n nk nthor women's organiz
ations In tho city for their Bupport In
tho movement. Similar boycotts
havo been Instituted against other ar
ticles by the women of various cas;
tern cities and have proved a pow
erful weapon against high prices.
Mrs. C. W. Rahhar, president of
the Housewives leaguo of Salt Lako
declined last evening to forecast
what action will bo talrcn at tho moot
ing next Wednesday. Sho said, how
over, that if tho voto favored tho In
auguration of the boycott surar would
practically disappear from tho family
grocery bill In so far as tho membors
of tho Housowlves leaguo Is concern
ed and that the movement would bo
carried to tho City Federation of Wo
