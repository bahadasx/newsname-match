BY R. F. PAINE.
Resolution* like that of Senator Pall appear to be rather hysterical, but it
seems almost impossible for anyone to cotiaufer Mexican matten without In
dulging in hysteric! in some degree.
We will Invade Mexico but are tK»n't want to ac
quire anything, roars Fall.

unteers as backing for the regular army.
To put me in tlit 1 fashion, will tin 1 editor of The
Timet kindly permit me to throw a particular fit of
my own { (We will. — Editor.)
If there ever were a burden that the white man
was jusuneci in tatcing upon nimsen, 11 is mexico.
When Mexicans are not in a state of anarchy and
war, they are in a state of slavery.
In war, the common people of Mexico are robbed
and slaughtered by a Villa, a Zapata, or any other
scoundrel who can control a band of cutthroats.
In peace, they are robbed, oppressed and often
executed without reason by the families of a Diaz, a
Huerta, or a Terrazes.
They are without hope of self-government, and
incapable of it, even were they permitted to try it.
An agricultural people, they are looted of their
products by all factions during war and are at the
mercy of the uWg" families' price lists during peace times, and the present
condition is that no man puts in a crop with miv assurance that he'll harvest
it.
Financially, the Mexicans arc a nation ol bankrupts, defaulters and pau
pers, under tne thumb of Wall street.
Bugenically, it is largely a nation of mongrels, with ancestral references
of the very worst.
Spread peace all over Mexico today, antl the national character, as de
fined by the gseat masses, still points straight at degradation and dissolution.
With these farms ruined and worthless, its finauces"'and factories controll
ed hy greedy foreigners, its religion persecuted, its only hope of government,
OUtrigm tyranny by a. lass, Mexico is a dying nation.
it is the strongest candidate on earth for place on the list of white men's
burdens.
If the present invasion of Mexico, authorized by President Wilson, who
• could govern Mexico, and maybe "authorized" by De Facto Carranza, who
can't govern Mexico, finally results in annexation of Mexico to the United
States, it will be a perfect godsend to the people of Mexcio.
"Nat ive pride ( Mex.) is the great obstacle to this, it is said.
It is the sentiment upon which the actual rulers and looters of Mexico rely
to enable them to hold on to what they've got and to get more, but it is highly
' probable that the common people of Mexico will enthusiastically turn out and
fight and die for a government, de facto, constitutional, hereditary or what
not, under which they are hopeless, poor and miserable.
However, "native pride" often goeih before a fall.
Note the recent case of the Philippines. We purchased those Filipinos,
body, soul and breeches, and didn't hesitate to lick such notions as "native
■ pride" and self-government out of them, because, being dead ones, nationally,
like the Mexicans, they were properly the white man's burden.

Agreement With
Carranza Causes
Sharp Criticism
WAHHINUTON. I>. <"-.
March 14. —With the Amer
ican troops prewiring to en
ter Mexico, President Wil
son today 1k threatened with
a congressional revolt
against the Mexican policy.
Outbursts of criticism are be
lleved to be imminent In the sen
ate where the reciprocity agree
ment with Carranza is disliked.
An explosion is alßo expected in
the house.
The White House iB indignant
about the Mexican war talk. The
administration Is considering
drastic HCtions to stop the inter
vention agitation.
Kear Bandit Itaids.
The principal protest in con
gress is bused on the fact that
the president failed lo discuss
the situation with congress be
fore consulting Carrun/ii.
Considering that many of the
('arraiuistas are semi-organized
bandits, some of them former fol
lowers of Villa, the opponents of
the scheme fear the afraemaai
will result in forays on Ameri
can soil by outlaws masquerad
ing as Carranztstits.
The state department admits
no written agreemnt exists be
tween Carranza and this country
concerning reciprocity. The op
ponents declare Wilson has over
stepped his powers.
Criticise Army.
Delay In starling the expedi
tion threatened to provoke criti
cism aimed at the army. Trans
portation facilities and the lack
of ammunition were criticised.
Administration officials insist
ed that diplomacy hadn't Impeded
mobilization. The state de
partment is again considering
warning all Americans to leave
Mexico.

SAN ANTONIO. March 14. —
The full co-operation of Carran
za In hunting Villa seemed as
sured today.
The American consulate an
nounced that I,otiti Carranalataa
were marching toward the border
to aid the American troops in
their search for the bandit lead
er.
It is understood that Gen. Ob
regon is in commandd of the con
stitutionalists.
All points along the border re
ported today that danger of Car
ran/.ista resistance had passed.
Gen. Pes(|itiera said that the id
mlnistratlon agreement with Car
ranza had allayed the anti-Aiinri
can sentiment in Mexico.
Cavalry predominates the
ramp. Thousands of horses ire
tethered In rows. The neighing
of the horses and the braying of
the army mules and donkeys,
carting munitions, the frequent
bugle calls and the clatter of
hoofs keep the camp in an up
roar.
MEXICO CITY, March 14. —
The danger of a break between
Mexico and the United States is
passed.
Inspired articles in today's
newspapers said "No official
statement has been issued, but
Washington dispatches declared
that the IT. S. has conceded the
justice of Carranza's demands in
accepting his Informal note."
Gen. Agullar wll handle fur
ther American negotiations.
It is believed Carranza will
resign the provisional presidency,
apolnting Agullar in his stead.
Then Carranza will run for pres
ident of Mexico.
