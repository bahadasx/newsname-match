IMPORTANT MEASURES PASS
No Fights Among The Members
Since Last Friday Powers
v Wins.
Fiankfort, Ky., March 13. The
session of the Legislature will end
tomorrow.
So much time has been lost . in al
most endless wrangling and quarrel
ing resulting in charges and counter
charges, the passing of the lie and an
attempted fist fight, that some sadly
needed legislation will never get to
the governor for his signature.
The liquor question, as in other
sessions, has been the source oi most
of the trouble during this session.
Much time, last week, was taken in
arguing the temperance question and
the Hutchcraft substitute for the
Greene anti-screen law is now ready
for Governor Stanley's approval. It
is believed here the governor will
sign the measure.
There is no question that Gov.
Stanley is sincere in his intention to
enforce the measure, once it becomes
a law. It carries an emergency
clause, making it effective as soon as
he signs his name to the bill. He
will undoubtedly lose no time in per
forming his duty to prove not only its
effectiveness, but also his own sin
cerity. Another'bill which Governor Stan
ley is expected to sign is the Knight
workmen's compensation bill, which
marked the winning of a long and
hard fight in behalf, of, the laboring
men of the state. Representatives of
labor were ,in the house galleries
when the revitalized measure was
passed without a dissenting vote.
Tho bill of Senator Huffaker, pro
viding for the employment of convicts
on public highways, was passed by
the house Saturday and Governor
Stanly will unquestionably sign this,
one of the measures which he pledged
the people would be enacted into law.
Despite the squabbles and quarrels
which marked last week, by working
overtime the legislators transacted
some business. They killed the wo
man's suffrage bill, tabled the so
called Finn bill and gave a big boost
to the Barret boxing commission bill
to legalize prize fights.
As is usual, consideration of bills
was rapid and action was taken on
many measures. The senate on one
day appropriated $37,000, which is
more than has been appropriated
during the previous days of all the
session. All of the money went to
charitable and educational institutions.
One of tho bitterest fights of the
session was that of last Friday night
over the ripper bill, which it is
charged, was intended to make such
changes in the Tenth and Eleventh
districts that Caleb Powers would bo
unable to succeed himself.
During tho night fillibuster in the
house against the bill, such disgrace
ful scenes wero witnessed, that
Speaker Duffy Saturday morning
named eight assistant scrgeant-at-arms
and instructed them to use
"whatever force is necessary" in
making members maintain order.
It was finally tabled, which ends its
career during this session.

Post Office at Bluff Springs
Robbed and In six Hours
Arrests are Made.
SEBREE BLOOD HOUNDS USED
Sam Fuller, One of The Men
Arnsled, is Seriously
Wounded.
Sunday night about 0 o'clock, the
post office at Bluff Spring was brok
en into. It was kept in the store of
J. B. Atkinson, and Mr. Atkinson,
the postmaster, acted with prompt
ness. He at once reported the theft
to the sheriff's office and without a
moment's delay the owner of the Se
brec bloodhounds was called up and
by getting an order for the fast night
train to stop at Sebree", the blood
hounds got here by 12 o'clock, three
hours after the house was broken in
to. ' Deputy Sheriffs Herbert Johnson
and Low Johnson rushed them to the
scene at once in an auto and the dogs
took the fresh trail and went directly
to the stable of Clinton Pitzer. Sam
Fuller was found in the barn and at
tempted to make his escape by
squeezing through a small crack.
The sheriffs had summoned Mr. At
kinson and others as a posse to assist
in the arrests and some one in the
sheriff's party stopped Fuller with a
pistol shot that struck him on tho
right side of his back and come out
through his left lung. He was taken
in charge. A little later Clinton Pit
zer and Bob Johns were met in the
road and arrested. On the way
down they had been passed and
stopped and a search made which dis
closed pistols and some money in
their pockets. They were not ar
rested at the time as the officers wero
intent on getting to the fresh trail
After the dogs led to Pitzer's stable,
they decided to look after him also
and luckily found him and Johns to
gether without much effort. All
three of the men were brought to
town and lodged in jail and Fuller's
wound attended to. It is a serious
but not necessarily a fatal wound.
The officers in returning found that
another store in the vicinity, that of
Mrs. West, had also been broken in
to. The dogs were put on this trail
but lost it at the road, where the
thieves had evidently mounted horses
or gotten into a vehicle.
The job from stirt to finish was
handled with the utmost dispatch and
'efficiency. The robbery was 10
' miles from town, tho dogs were 56
I miles from Hopkinsviile and yet they
. were brought here in three hours and
, in three hours more the work had
been finished and the men arrested
' were safe in jail.
1 The men all lived in the the neigh
borhood of Bluff Springs and Sam
Fuller has been in trouble before.

Will Not Let Uncle Sam Invade
Mexico Unless He is Allowed
Same Privilege.
FUNSTON KEEPS CLOSE MOUTH
Not Known When Expedition
Will Betfin Pursuit
ol Villa.
Washington, D. C. March, 13.
Carranza on Sunday night followed
up his request for a reciprocal invas
ion privilege, by issuing a manifesto
that under no circumstances would
he grant the right to the United States
to invade Mexico without a recipro
cal privilege to his forces.
Secrecy regarding Gen. Funston's
plans for moving against Villa and his
bandits has been so rigidly enforced
at the war department that even high
ofllcials of the government were in
doubt tonight at to whether American
troops actually had crossed the Mexi
can border.
Secretary Baker announced that
the Twenty-third infantry, now at
Galveston, Tex., had been ordered to
El Paso because of fear of Mexican
attacks felt in many towns along the
border.
When President Wilson returns to
Washington this morning, after a
week-end outing'on the yacht May
flower, he will take up witli Secre
tary Lansing the note from Gen. Car
ranza, requesting permission for the
de facto troops to pursue bandits into
American territory, should the need
arise. Administration officials antici
pate a prompt answer to Gen. Car
ranza, and believe it will be satisfac
tory to the defacto government.
The President will find botli the
White House and war department in
direct telegraphic communication
with virtually every strategic point
along the border involved in the
present situation. To save delay in
transmitting messages, this arrange
ment has been made with the tele
graph campanies, and should the ex
peditionary forces string a field wire
behind them after crossing the
border, it would be possible for re
ports to go directly from the front to
the department.
The general instructions to Gen.
Funslon, it is understood, lay stress
upon the necessity of impressing
Mexicans on both sides of the border
with the fact that the United States is
interested only in defending its own
borders, and that troop movements
now in progress or contemplated have
no other object. Officers of tho ex
peditionary force will be directed to
make this clear to civilians as well as
oificials of the de facto government
with whom they come in contact.
Instructions arc explicit, it is said, to
capture or disperse bandits and re
turn to the United States territory
immediately.
YOUNG PEOPLE ORGANIZE.
The fast growing Second Baptist
Church organized a B. Y. P. U. Sun
day night with 30 members. Mr. Joe
East was elected President and Fen
ton S. Cunningham Vice-President.
All the young people and some of the
older members are hiking great inter
est in the B. Y. P. U. and there is
ho doubt that It will be a great suc
cess. Everybody is cordially invited
to attend whether a member of that
church or not. If you aro not a mem
ber of that church you may join the
B. Y P, U. as a social member.
Tho Second Baptist church is work
ing hard to liave its church complet
ed. And tho way things aro moving
before the year is cono there will bo
something dono towards building the
big audition.

the public is invited. The young la
dies rendor some very fino music and
the entertainment will bo a rare treat.
BOMBARDMENT STILL STRONG
Germans Tell of Repulsing At
tacks on Positions Which
They Had Taken.
Except for artillery action, the fight
ing in the Verdun region virtually
has ceased for the moment To the
north and east of the fortress there
has been no infantry engagement
since Saturday afternoon, when the
Germans succeeded in entering a
small trench to the north of Eix.
On both sides of the Mouse, from
thr northwest of Verdun, along the
front to the southeast of the fortress,
the artillery of both sides has coiit
tinued the tremendous shelling that
has been in progress for days.
The Germans claim to have cap
tured in the fighting around Verdun
thus far 26,472 unwounded French
ofliicers and men and 189 guns and
232 machine guns.
To the south of the Somme river,

further progress against the Turks in
Persia by taking the town of Kirind.
The Russians admit the sinking of a
Russian torpedo boat destroyer by a
submarine of the central powers in
the Black sea otf the Bulgarian port
i of Varna. Part of the crew of the
destroyer was rescued.

conditions in the mountains, the Ital
ians are continuing their operations
against the Austro-IIungarians. They
also are intensely bombarding the
Isonzo front. The town of Gorizia
has had to sustain another hail of Ital
ian shells.

a vessel of 5,6-14 tons, has been lost,
together with fourteen members of
her crew, by striking a mine off the
east coast of England.
A Paris dispatch says that testimony
given the American consul at Havre
by the seven Americans on board and
members of the crew of the Norwe
gian bark Silius, which was sunk off
the coast of France, is that the bark
was torpedoed by a submarine and
without warning.
