At the same time, Secretary j sue to, but literally the whole British
LanBing, by instruction of the Presi-, existence. They are so dominant, have

ment that the United States under-

complete and in force.'
The decision of the Administration
to accept the Carranza proposal was
reached at a conference between Presi

this conference followed conversations
between the President and leaders In
Congress,
Secretary Lansing late in the after
noon sent a telegram to American Con
sul Silllman, at Guadalajara, Mexico,
directing him to Inform the Carranza
Government of the decision of the Un
ited States, a formal note to the Mex
ican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Senor
Acuna, being embodied in the telegram.
At same time General Funston was in
formed that this Government regarded
the , reciprocal arrangement as being
"in force" and that under it General
Funston was free to move the punitive
expedition across the border in pursuit
of Villa at any time.
If the expeditionary columns have

One of the biggest basketball scores
on record waa made by the North Ad

ing when It defeated the Bennington
five by the alnfose unheard-of score of
109 to 14. - In Its account of the game
the North Adams Transcript says:
"The funny part of the performance
was that It was generally expected
that Bennington would provide lively
opposition to the home team. The in

GILDED TRAGEDY.
Unnatural Atmosphere of City Drunk
wich War Money
To come from England to Manhat
tan island, from a country strung up
as never before In its annals to the her
oic pitch, full of the spirit of sacrifice
endurance and in dally touch with
grimmest facts of life and death
tome from such a country and to
Vh-J m New York is to make a change
. For New York, always a fev-
I "su Pleasure-loving city, is to-day
simply urunk wIUi money. Even dur
ing i iie aeigni 01 me steet ooom or iz
or 13 years ago when every train from
the West seemed to bring fresh car
loads of brand-new millionarles. the
metropolis was not so openly reeling
witn dollars as it Is at this moment,
when the gayest "season" of its histo
ry is drawing to a close. It almost ap
pals an Englishman to find there in full
Bwing the old rotten life that we in
England have put completely behind
us. And it appals him still more to re
flect that a bare two years ago he was
leading, if one allows for the extra in
tensity that New York throws into all
its activitifs, very much the same life
himself. One despairs of ever beine
able to convey to one's American
that no other form nf iif
all the trivial carelessness of peace,
seems normal or even credible. I catch
myselw in New York, if I enter a
lighted ' room, instinctively reaching
out to draw down the blinds lest a Zep
pelin raider Bhould note the glare; and
of all the sights that crowd in upon me
that of multitudes of young men who
are not in khaki strikes me as the
strangest and the most repellant. It
may be one more proof of our dement
ed state, but It is the bare fact that not
for anything would we in England
change places with you in America or
part with tho waste and misery of the
war to receive in return the "bless
ings" of such a peace as yours. Stay-aV
horne Americans simply cannot enter
into tr even conceive the atmosphere
of the belligerent nations in this strug
gle ; and conversely, bo long as it lasts,
a visitor from any one of the countries
at war will continue to be shocked by
the atmosphere of America as some
thing unnatural to the point of being
grotesque,
In New'York' the fact and the vast
ness of this chasm of sentiment assail
the visitor with the sharp finality of
a bayonet thrust, Louvain and Rhelms
are among the stricken victims of the
war. but New York Is its supreme and
gilded tragedy, and has, I fear, neither
the sense nor the . soul to . know it:

INTEREST IN PLAN WIDE-SPREAD
Citizens Have Responded In Manner
That Assures Building of Important
Link During Coming Season.
lemebers of the committees from
Bennington board or trade and the
Bdpnington County Improvement as
sociation, who a short time ago began
tlidir campaign to raise 2500 to be ex
peided on the construction of a first
dais highway over what is locally
knuiwn as the "West End" road, are
now confident that they will be suc
cessful in securing the full amount.
Durfaig the last two weeks they have
obtained a number of good-sized sub
scrliifions and the first of this week
the fund was given a substantial boost
by tfco contributions of $500 each.
While they have been engaged in the
work of raising the fund the members
of the committee have been
agreeably surprised by the un
usual amount of interest that
the people approached have mani
fested In the project to build the
road. Many of those who have sub
scribed have been even more generous
in their contributions than was expec
ed and Mie committee members are en
thusiastic over the manner in which
the plan has been received.
At the annual March meeting the
town of Bennington voted 2500 for the
work, thus carrvintr out the part of the
campaign that was alloted to the citiz
en as a community. The committee
now feel certain that they will sureljf
be able to realize the second $2500.,
There Is good-.reason to, believe that'
the state highway commissioner will
be in a position to duplicate the ?5000
from the state funds.
It has been estimated that it will cost
118,000 to build the road and Mr. Col-
gate has expressed a readiness to put
into the work on such a basis all but
410400, v It is .to be hoped that when
the'highway commissioner,1 .Stoddard
B. Bates of Derby; attends tn annual
good roads meetingfon April f that he
will be in a position to give, assurance
that: will warrantithe: beginning of the
construction work as eoomas the frost
is cut of the ground. ;r r v
.- Much credit i3 due the members of
the two committees, whw have; worked
so induBtrioiraly to raise the 'money.
When the scheme of funding the pro
ject was originally outlined it was
evident that( their portion nf the worM
would require the most effort. Credit
also Is dua to the citizens who have
responded so generously to aid the
cause. The success that has been at
tained so far. tho spirit with which
the voters endorsed the project at the
annual town meeting and the readi
ness with which the subscription is
being completed, one more demon
strate that Bennington can .always be
depended upon in an emergency or
this nature. ...

Y. M. C. A. FORUM.
Discussion of Mexican Crisis Led
Judge Holden.
By
The Y. M. C. A. Forum will hold its
semi-monthly meeting tomorrow night,
at 8.15, and will be led in a discus
sion of the Mexican crisis by Judge E
II. Holden. !
The Mexican situation is a timely
subject for discussion. In fact, it is
the duty of patriotic citizens to -create
and clarify public opinion on it.
Should this country chase Villa far
ther than the border? Should the
United States make a reciprocal ar
rangement with Carranza so that . he
may enter the United States? Is the
Mexican family quarrel analogous to
a quarrel in the family next door, In
which case the neighbors would in
tervene if violence were used?
Come, and bring up your own ques
tions, or present your point of view.
The meeting is open to all men, wheth
er Association members or not.

day in New Orleans when he discov

The price -was $25 for one language or

The young pilot, with his usual en

the Verdun front laBt night and today.
There were no infantry actions in that
region.
The rival airmen raided strategic
points back of the hostile lines. Berlin
announces that stations and military
depots, especially on the Clermont-Ver

planes. One French air machine Is
said to have been destroyed during the
operations.
The French official bulletins report
even greater achievements by air light

been dropped on the railroad station
at Conflans, twenty-two miles east of
Verdun, setting the building afire.
A squadron of six French aeroplanes
flew over Brleulles, north of Verdun,
and dropped 130 shells on the place.
A large number of combats were
fought, and it Is stated that three Ger

supported by 600 cavalry and 12-centimeter
guns, started on Jan. 12 from
Shelkhnosman, north of Aden, and
occupied the town of Aflsch. They
attacked the Turkish vanguards with
superior forces, but were stopped by
a Turkish counterattack from El
Wahita. After three hours the enemy
withdrew. Only the protection of long
range artillery averted a panic.
The enemy then tried to offer re
sistance at El Emelhale, four kilo
metres south of Aflsch, in positions
which they had prepared in advance,
but were forced by Turkish troops to
retreat into the fortified camp of
Shiekh Osman, under the protection
of the cannon of ships anchored in
the Gulf of Aden. ,
The Turks destroyed the town and 1
fortifications of El Emelhale, and cap
lured supplies there. .
