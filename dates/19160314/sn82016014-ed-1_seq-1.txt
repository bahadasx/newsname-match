STANDPATTERS OUT OF SADDLE
Topeka Man Who Had Not An

Will He Be Able to Name Next
National Committeeman 2
Ottawa. Kan.. March 14. Dave
Mulvane lost his fight in the Sec
ond Congressional District Itcpub
lican convention today. Charles
Tucker of Lawrence and John O.
Morse of Lynn county, two anti
Mulvane men, were elected dele
gates to the national convention
here late this afternoon. Sennet
Kirk of Anderson county, and Dr.
C. W. Jones of Olathe were chos
en as alternates. All four of the
delegates art Ma ml pa t Republic
ans, but are looked upon as men
opposed to Mulvane for national
committeeman.
The result is the outcome of a
combination effected with Lynn
county by delegations from Frank
lin, Douglas and Wyandotte coun
ties. Morse was a dark horse and
Ids candidacy was sprung at the
last minute. Tucker was elected
on the first ballot, receiving: 76
votes against Tom Kelly's 52. Big
ger of Kansas Ci t y reeei ved 4ft
votes: Jones of Ola the. 45 and
Baxter McLean f Iola, 25. On
the second ballot. Morse led and
was elected with 75 rotes against
Kelly's 27: Jones, 5 and McLean,
15. Kirk and Jones were chosen
alternates by acclamation.
Foreboding of Mulvano's defeat
came when a temporary organi
sation was effected and Senator
O. O. Wolf of Franklin, an anti
Mulvanc man. was elected tempo
rary chairman by a vote of 57 to
48 against Baxter McLean. Prior
to this ballot Mulvarte-'s men
claimed to control 66 of the 122
detonates.
Conventions today in five congres-
sional districts wilt virtually decide j
the fight for Republican national com
mitfeeman. When the returns com
from the Second. Third. Fifth. Sixth
and Eighth districts tonight, D. W.
Mulvane of Topeka will be quite cer
tain to know whether he is to regain
his old job cn the national committee.
In any event, political leaders figure.
Mulvane will have a hand in the nam
ing of the new committeeman. The
contest today decides merely whether
Mulvane personally or a man named
by Mulvane shall win.
For three weeks D. W. Mulvane has
been an issue before almost every
county convention and primary in
Kansas. His name hap been good for
first page position in the Kansas
newspapers and he has been on the
j editorial page of nearly every Repub
lican ana i-rogressive newspaper ir i
the state.
So close is the fight today that
neither the Mulvane nor the anti-Mul- '
vane followers are making noisy j
claims as to results. Mulvane has
not shown the slightest desire to break

FRANK THOMAS
PREDICTS WAR
WITH MEXICO
Topekan Says Entire Republic
Will Turn Against U. 8.
Carranza Sever Will Keep
Faith. He Declares.
THOMAS WILL NOT RESIGN
j Asserts He Has No Intention of
Leaving Democrats.
"Villa Never Can Be Taken
Alive Too Shrewd."
Carranza will never keep faith with
the United States. In a week forces of
Carranza will swing behind Villa, who
already his the support and sympathy
of one-half of Mexico.
That was the sensational statement
today of Frank S. Thomas of Topeka., a
personal friend of Villa. Thomas is
confident Villa will never be taken
alive and declares that the situation in
Mexico is due to bad judgment on tie
pait cf President Wilson and hfu cab
inet. In Mr. Thomas judgment Carranza
will be fortunate if he gets out of
Mexico alive. He fears we have got
ten into war with Mexico, which all
good citizens ought to regret. Mexico,
ne says, may be our Servia.
Thomas, a Democrat and b:.er op
ponent of President Wilson in his
handling of the Mexican situation, de
clares that the move to send troops
into Mexico means but one thing war
with the entire country. Carranza,
Thomas declares, has never been a
friend of the American government.
He has never acted in good faith. He
is without the following of his peo
ple and Villa will enlist the support of i
Mexi-o in the fight which the Topeka J
man declares can mean nothing Tess j
than war.
Doubts Columbus Story.
The coiumbus massacre was ue- i
plorable, don't misunderstand me in j
I that," said Thomas today. "But I be-
I lieve there is another story of the Co
iumbus slaughter. I don t think all
of the truth has yet been told."
"Do you believe the American ov
ernment erred in extending reciprocal
privileges to Carranza's troops to ross
the border into the United t Sates ?"
was asked of Thomas.

Another Boost.
Price Is Double That of a Few
Months Ago.
The high cost of automobiling re
ceived another boost today when a
raise in the price of gasoline was an
nounced by the Topeka Oil company.
Gasoline is now selling for 21 cents ti
gallon at tl.e local stations. Advances
have been steady since last fall, nd
the price is d uble that of nine
months ago.
I An advance of 10 cents a bnrrel on
crude oil has been made also. This
brings t" price up to $1.55 a barrel
besides the premium. Ml also has
shown a steady increase in price dur
ing the past year.
Some time ago it was predicted by
an official of an independent oil com
pany in the east, that gasoline would
go to 40 cents or even 50 cents before
this summer is over, unless an em
bargo was established by the govern
ment on exports. At the rate it has
been advancing in the past few months
