Columbus, N. M Mnrch 14. It Is
understood hero Qoncral Pershing Is
to nssumo Immediate command ot the
troops nlrcady concentrated hero for
the punltlvo expedition against Villa
Into Mexico. Commands now nt Co
lumbus muster approximately 3,500
men.
Several other commands nro cX'
pectcd, tho plan apparently being to
mnke the column to move out of Co
lumbus, the main unit of tho expc
dltlonary force with field wireless and
aeroplane equipment.
Organizations now here arc eight
troops of tho Thirteen Cavalry, with
tho First Squadron en routo from
Mnrfa, Tex., and other border polnti
east, the Sixth nnd Sixteenth rcgi
tncnts of infantry, three companies
of tho First Battalion ot the Twentieth
Infantry. Dnttcrles A. 11. and C, com
posing twelve mountain guns ot the
Fourth Field Artillery, Ilnttery C, of
tho Sixth Field Artillery, field wire
loss organization, Held hospital and
ambulance.
It wob reported that In addition to
tho First, .Math, Tenth nnd Eleventh
regiments of the cavalry, two squad
rons of the Twelfth would bo dispatch
here at once.
Another report stated that three
aeroplanes were en route hero from
San Diego, Cal.
General Pablo Hertnni, commanding
tho garrison ot 2,000 Carrnnzu troops
at l'nlmoas, six miles south ot the lor
dcr, yesterday notified American milt
tary authorities that lie expected to
call on General Pershing for a confer
ence.
12,(KM) Troops tin Harder.
Approximately 12,000 troops with
forty mountain and field gun batteries
were on the border last night be
twoon Douglas, Ariz., nnd El Paso,
lino about 200 miles long. A little
moro than one-third of this force was
cavnlry.
F"rom a camp of a fow hundred men
Columbus yesterday grew to a mill
tary establishment of nearly 2,000,
with Indications that about 4,000 men
nro to be concentrated here Iminedl
ately. Further evidence that this
point may bo tho starting place of the
largest column in Immediate pursuit
of Villa appeared In tho erection of
headquarters for Brigadier General
John G. Pershing, whom Major Gen
era! Funston announced would be the
leader of the expeditionary force. Ofn
cers here talked of a march straight
southward In pursuit of Villa. Troop
movements seemed to bear out reports
that while the Columbus column Is
striking south, another movement will
bo made from tho vicinity of EI Pnso,
and a third from tho Arizona line
somcwhero near Douglas. Doth th
Ela Paso and Douglas movements
would be able to follow rail lines,
while tho central column from here
would have to go overland.
Dclief here last night was that the
Columbus column would be ready to
start by Thursday or Friday. Intel
llgcnco department officers secured
maps and topography charts of the
mountainous Chihuahua-Sonora bor
der Into which It seems possible for
Villa to hide with his present start.
Villa's position, according to report
received by General Pablo Bertanl, In
command of 2,000 soldiers Just across
tho Moxlcan border from hero was
at CorralltoB, whero ho stopped more
than two days ago.
