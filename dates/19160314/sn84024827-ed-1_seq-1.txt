Embargo On. .
WASHINGTON. March 13. The Un
ited States has enterec into a formal
agreement with the defacto govern
ment of Mexico under 'which Ameri
can troops can cross the border to pur
sue Villa and his bandits with the ex
pectation of hearty cooperation of the
Carranza forces. Secretary Lansing
made public the text of the note ac
cepting Carranza's proposal for recip
rocal arrangements between the two
governments and announcing the Un
ited States held this arrangement to
be now in operation and binding upon
both parties. Fuuston will carry out
the task under this agreement.
Offifial announcement was awaited
tonisht that the American force had
crossed the border. Plarts for the
i "-ops movement proceeded without
riard to diplomatic exchanges. Lan
sine also made public a statement is
sued in the name of the President re
iterating that every step of the Ad
ministration was based on a deliber
ate intention to preclude the possibili
ty of arn.ed intervention in Mexico.
The note of Carranza defines the
tomir. beyond the possibility of mis
construction. It provides where con
ditions arise on the American side of
the border similar to those of Colum
bus which led to the order of General I
Funston to enter Mexico, the same
privilege be accorded the de facto
government without the necessity of
further exchange of views. It clearly
stated the bandits to be pursued on
American soil, by Mexican troops,
must have come from the American
r.ide snd committed depredations on
1he Mexican side and fled back to the
United States. There has been no
such instance on record in recent
years.
Oficials of the Mexican embassy
here ar, jubilant( over the acceptance
of Carranza's proposal. Eliseo Arre
dondo, the Mexican ambassador desig
nate, withheld comment pending ad
vices from Carranza. Other officials
openly exhibited their satisfaction
with the American note which was!
promptly transmitted to Carranza.)
borne said that while a few extreme
radicals among Carranza adherents
" ight oppose th,, agreement but this
element is not important nor would it
influence the relations between the
two governments. .
Nsvxy Department advices from Ve-j
ra Cruz. Tampico and other points in i
the Mexicen gulf coast, tended to con-i
firm this view. Commanders of Amer-1
ican warships in these waters said ihel
mitlication of the intention of tha Un-j
ited States to send armed, forces intoj
Mexico after Villa has not caused ex-1
citement or uneasiness. There arei
no indications of anti-American dem-1
rnstrations, the message said, even i
when it appeared doubtful as to what
course Carranza would pursue. i
To prevent war munitions from
reaching Villa, the Treasury Depart-)
mcnt instructed the collectors at San.
Francisco, Nogales, and Los Angeles'
to place an embargo on the shipment j
of arms and ammunition through these
points into Mexico. The embargo af-!
fects the principal commercial gate-'
ways in'o Chihuahua, Sonora and Low !
er California. It in regarded as suffi-1
cient to make certain that Villa not bej
supplied from the United States. A
preent there is no intention to ex
tend it to other Mexican territory.

Should the Germans be victorious m their drive against the French at

of Trouble with Carranza.
WASHINGTON, March 13. Dan
ger of the grave complications, grow
ing out of the sending of American
troops Into Mexico, were voiced in
the senate by Senator Chamberlain,
chairman of the military committee,
and Senator Borah, Republican, in ad
vocating the laying asice, temporarily
of all other legislation in order to dis
pose promptly of the prepareness
measures.
Their statements precipitated a
general discussion in which Senators
Vardaman and Simmons deprecated
the suggestions that the United States
was not prepared to deal with any
situation that might arise in its rela
tions with Mexico.
(Continued from Page 1)
President Wilson urged the House
to speed up the legislative action on
all important matters In time for ad
journment in June.
House leaders agreed it would be
impossible in so short a time. The
present plans are for the passing of
the legislative appropriation bill to
morrow, the disposing of the free su
gar bill, and then taking up the Immi
gration measure. With this carried
out It is probable the army measure
will be reached early next week.
Reports from the border laid before
the President by Secretary Baker
stated the rst force against Villa was
ready to move at any time. The Pres
ident is said to resent deeply the re
ports that the United States expects
trouble from General Carranza. Some
administration officials express the
view that certain elements in the

of backing up the expeditionary force
is needed. He was non-comnijttal as
to the time needed to accomplish this.
Funston declared the reports that Am

the border in pursuit of Villa were un
'rue. He said it would be useless iO
send any but a strong and well pro
portioned force into Mexico. Tht the

little more than a third of the force
is cavalry. From a camp of a few
hundred men Columbus, overnight and
-c:1ay. grew to a military establish-
en of nearly two thousand.
Indications are that nearly four thou
ar.d will be concentrated here imme
diately. Evidence that this will be tbe
taring place of the largest column in
the immediate pursuit of Villa appear
"d in the erection of headquarters of
Brigadier General Pershing, leader of
'he expeditionary force.
Officers talked of a march straight
southward in pursuit. Troop move
ments seemed to bear out the reports
hat while the Columbus column is
striking south, another movement will
be made in the vicinity of El Paso and
a third from the Arizona line near
Douglas. Both the El Taso and Doug
'as movements will be able to follow
rail lines while the central column
will go overland across a desert. The
belief is that the Columbus column will
be ready to start Thursday or Friday.
Villa's position, according to reports
