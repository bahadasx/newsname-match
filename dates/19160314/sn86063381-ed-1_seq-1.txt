Annexation of Village to Bemitt.,
Dicnssed at Special
Meeting.
NYMORE VILLAGE
COUNCIL PRESENT
Action Necessary Village School is
Condemned Favored by
Many.
Members of the Nymore village
council and a number of residents
of Nymore appeared before the Be
midji city council at a meeting held
last evening at the city hall and asked
the Bemidji council to take into con
sideration the annexation of the vil
lage of Nymore to Bemidji.
Favored by Many.
Members of the Nymore delegation
stated that they believed that an
nexation was favored by a majority
of the residents and that action
I would be taken immediately.
The members of the Nymore coun
cil present were H. C. Blackburn,
president of the council and a mem
ber of the school board, J. W. Smith,
trustee of the council and president
of the school board, J. T. Kutchera,
I. E. Joanis and Fred Hammond, re
corder.
School Condemned.
H. C. Blackburn in a short talk
brought out the fact that the an
nexation problem had been brought
to a head through condemnation of
the Nymore school The Nymore
school was condemned several weeks
ago by state authorities and the
building will not be able to be used
after this semester.
"We come to Bemidji tonight to
get the sentiment of the Bemidji
council on the consolidation of Ny
more and Bemidji," said Mr. Black
burn "We're doing this mostly on
account of the school proposition. In
my estimation annexation will be
beneficial to both corporations. I be
lieve that the sentiment of the peo
ple of Nymore highly favor the idea
of annexation."
Favors Annexation.
J. W. Smith, president of the Ny
more school board, told of the situa
tion relative to the school. He stated
that the Nymore school could be run
the balance of the term but from that
time on the school will be unfit for
use.
Alderman J. P. Lahr, who is a
v^ member of the Bemidji school board,
stated that the Bemidji board would
do all in its power to help consoli
date. He pointed to the fact that
if three other school districts consoli
date with Bemidji $2,000 could
be secured from the state for trans
portation purposes. There are sev
eral districts south of Nymore which,
it is believed, would be willing to be-
U,
come annexed if Nymoro wa3 an-
nexed.
Indebtedness Discussed.
The question of the indebtedness
of Bemidji and Nymore was discuseed.
It was stated by members of the
council that Bemidji has an indebted
ness of $105,000, including both
floating and bonded indebtedness. Ny
more is bonded to the sum of $7,000
and has a floating indebtedness of
$14,000.
City Attorney P. J. Russell in dis
cussing the legal phase of the an
nexation, stated:
"In the consideration of the prob
lem last fall it was found that peti
tions are not considered in the mat
ter. There is to be an election,
which will dissolve Nymore, if affir
mative, if not the matter is dropped.
When the plan is accepted, by such
an election, Nymore would have six
months to clear up its indebtedness.
With Clean Hands.
"Nymore will not accept any of
^emidji's indebtedness, but will come
with clean hands. Bonded indebted
ness will be treated in the same way
that the school indebtedness will be,
that is the public property will be
sold for the dispensation of the debt.
"After six months as an unorgan
ized town, during which time the
debts of the village will be attended
to, an election for annexation will
be held. If the result is in the af
firmative, it will be reported to the
council, which will not have been
dissolved. If the council accepts the
reports by a three-fourths vote, the

JESTER ADDS
GAME BIRDS TO
RESORT REFUGE
Bemidji Man Has Private Reserve at
Lake Plantaganet Experiments
Are Successful.
SUMMER RESORT TO
OPEN MAY FIRST
Ducks and Other Game Birds Are In
troduced to Attract Many
Summer Visitors.
As an attraction to summer resort
ers and to encourage the preservation
of game A. H. Jester is restocking
his summer resort at Lake Plantag
anet with numerous species of wild
fowl. With the natural surround
ings provided at the resort, a flock
of eight mallards, domesticated, have
thrived and it is Mr. Jester's inten
tion to experiment with other such
fowls.
Sixteen in Flock.
Starting with several wing-tipped
ducks two years ago, the flock grew
last seasqu to sixteen. During the
entire season 80 eggs hatched out 60
ducks. Sixteen grew to maturity,
but hunters killed eight. The pres
ent flock has lived through the win
ter with hardly any extra care.
"Many people have the idea that
wild ducks are very hard to tame,"
said Mr. Jester today. "The fact of
the matter is that it is easy to gain
their confidence. If they can be cap
tured at the time they are first
wounded, and kept corraled with
their wings clipped, they soon learn
to put confidence in a person."
Three Mallards.
Mr. Jester's new stock includes
three mallards, two hens and one
drake, which he has secured from
the Jager Game farm in Southern
Minnesota. By this addition he can
start the season with eleven matured
ducks.
In addition to his ducks he will
have two genuine Canadian "honk-
ers," geese, and three ring-necked
pheasants, for which he has sent to
Huron, S. D. He will also have two
settings of twenty-four quail eggs,
which he will receive from Carlos
Avery, state game and fish commis
sioner, with a game refuge permit.
"Just the minute the wild birds in
the vicinity of the corral see that no
harm will come to them it will be
the rendezvous of game birds," said
Mr. Jester. "I might, although it is
very indistinct and uncertain, make
a commercial proposition of the af-
fair."
With the addition of the new
specimens of fowls and with the
proximity of the state park, a tourist
within one day's ride can see many
of the fowls and all the big game
living in this part of the state.
Mr. Jester has already received
numerous inquiries concerning the
opening of his summer resort and ex
pects to have a fine season this year.
He will open his summer resort the
first of May.

LIGHT VOTE TO
BE CAST IN THE
STATE'S PRIMARY
First Presidential Primary Bringing
Out Very Few Voters in Be
midji District.
VOTE IN CITY TO BE
LESS THAN 250
Town and Village Elections Being
Held Blackduck Votes on
license.'
Minnesota today is holding her
first presidential primaries, and if the
Bemidji vote is an example of the
state-wide vote, the vote will be very
light.
It is believed that there will be
less than 250 votes cast in Bemidji.
There appears to be little interest
in the outcome of the election.
Town Elections Held.
Town and village elections in this
district are causing more or less in
terest. Blackduck is having a spir
ited election on the license question.
Several cities in the state are vo
ting under the local option law to
day, the largest of these being Owa
tonna.
Progressive Candidate.
The Progressive" party, technically,
had a candidate for president of the
United States in the field at the presi
dential preference primary today, but
his name didn't get on the ballot. The
man was Hiram Johnson, governor of
California, whose name was filed by
Minnesota Progressives.
Minnesota law provides for seven
teen delegates to the national Pro
gressive convention. Just that num
ber filed for the place, obviating a
contest. There was only one Pro
gressive presidential candidate.
Hence, there being no contest in the
Progressive ranks, the entire Pro
gressive ticket was certified, and left
off the ballot today.
Wilson Named.
The presidential timber on the
Minnesota ballot being used today
follows.
DemocraticFor President, Wood
row Wilson.

B. Lindsey, Denver Findley T. Hend
rickson, Maryland.
Went Through Courts.
Minnesota's first presidential pref
erence primary went through today
only after a fight in the supreme
court. Under the law, delegates to
national conventions must pledge
their support to some officially re
corded aspirant for the presidential
nomination. Many prominently men
tioned as presidential timber refused
to permit their names to be filed on
the Minnesota ballot. This elimin
ated any delegates who wanted to go
to the national conventions for them.
It was upon this point in the law
that the two supreme court attacks
were made.
Charles E. Hughes, New York
Theodore Roosevelt, New York
Elihu Root, New York, and Hiram
Johnson, California, declined to per
mit their names to be used. John
son's withdrawal got here too late.
