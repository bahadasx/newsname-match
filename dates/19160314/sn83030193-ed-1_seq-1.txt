A fire that started in n dumbwaiter

o'clock to-day spread panic among
nearly ono hundred theatrical pcopl

Jam furfur, a iiegro-'vlirralbf boy,
prevented loss of life.
The two houses nre old fashioned

roomers. Thn house was beginning
to awake whon a clgnrotto in a wnsto

thick pillar of smoke, lly the tlmo
Doputy Chief John Hums arrived tho

smoke had tilled all tho hallways.
James Turner kept his elevator go

down more than half the tenants.
Tho roat took to the stairs, half
blinded by smoke, which was unusu

rather than up.
Policemen Koenlg and Kelly of tho
West Blxty-elghth Ktreot precinct
cleared tho stairs of the crowd of

May, Thero will bo no delay, a statu
tory provision giving matters of vital
Interest to tho city preeodencu over
all others on tho calendar.
It Is explained that Craven Is made
co-defendant wUh tho Interborough
because of the fact that ho passed
on all I lie expense accounts known
as "predeterminations," and Uuri
by deprived the city of what the
Corporation Counsel will prove It ts
entitled to.

Is authority for th statement that
tho contract between the City of New

From what could bo learned of the
