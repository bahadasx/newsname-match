COUPLE OF GOOD
SOCCER CONTESTS
A. IU Wl OVV.l II LI v. i 1 CI y j
ed Saturday afternoon on the High i
School athletic field, and they fur
nished pienty of excitement for
the large crowd of spectators, The
games were scheduled to begin at
2:00 but it was after 3 before the
visiting teams put in an appear
ance. On account of the delay
many people had to leave during
the second game, and they missed
a game well worth seeing. It is
expected that future games n ill be
started promptly.
The first game called was be
tween High School and Eleele.
The visitors played a strong de
fensive game and kicked out of
many hard places. Their offensive
was not strong and only once did
they seriously tin eaten their
opponents' goal. The local team
showed flashes of good soccer, and
carried the ball well into the
enemy's territorv, but they were
weak in following the ball and
placing their kicks when near the
goal The game ended with one
goal scored by the locals.
Lihue and Koloa then took the
field. Lihue started off by rush
ing the ball down the field and
putting Koloa on the defensive.
The Koloa boys defended well and
there was lots of excitement among
the rooters when Koloa finally got
the ball out of her penaltv area
and took the offensive. The Lihue
boys had hard, work to keep the.
attackers from scoring-several
kicks just missed the goal posts by
inches.
Lihue succeeded in scoring near
the end of the second half and that
ended the scoring.
All the teams are verv evenly
matched this year on account of
the light team entered by the High
School. The scores have been un
usually close and the playing is
much superior to that of last year.
Wednesday of this week Lihue
and High School play at the High
School and Koloa and Kleele play
at Eleele, Next Saturday there
will be games at the High school
grounds between all the teams of

REIGHELT CASE TO
TRIAL Tl
The trial jury in the Circuit
Court finished its work last Friday
and was excused until tomorrow,
when both it and the grand jury
will meet again.
The case yet to be heard is that
of Hans Reichelt, late timekeeper
of Lihue Plantation Company, who
is charged with embezzlement.
E. C. Peters will arrive from
Honolulu tomorrow to appear as
attorney for the defendant and J.
W. Cathcart will come over by the
same steamer to conduct the case
for the prosecution. This would
indicate that a fight is to be made
bv the accused man.
Two witnesses will also arrive
tomorrow, one being the expert
who came over some weeks ago to
audit the accounts of Reichelt and
the other being the substitute
bookkeeper who was here dining
the autumn.
THE FATAL SPREE
OF A PORTO R
Last Wednesday afternoon a Ha
waiian named Aocla, while walk
ing along near the Kealia stream,
at Kapahi, discovered a badly de
composed body floating in the wa
ter. The police were notified and
the remains taken in charge. A
coroner's jurv was empanelled and
tried for three days to establish
the identity of the corpse without
avail. It was finally proved quite
conclusively, however, that the re
mains were those of Mateo, a Por
to Rican.
Following up the case it was
found that Mateo had been paid
some money for labor and straight
way proceeded to get intoxicated.
He had quite evidently tried to
cross the stream above Kapahi and,
being too drunk to navigate, fell
in.
Just what day all that happened,
however, it was impossible to de
termine. It seems likely, from the
appearance of the corpse, that it
was at least a week ago.
Mrs. Akina Dead
Mrs. Punohti Akina, wife of
Rev. J. A Akina, died at the
family residence in Waimea about
2 a. m. Sunday of a stomach tiouble,
aged 52. The funeral took place

Deceased left three children, one
daughter living in Honolulu; a
second daughter being Mrs. W.V.

TERRITORY OF HAWAII, TUESDAY,
Sugar, 5.46.
Honolulu W. R. Farrington has been definitely offciXd the posi
tion on the board of supervisors left acant by the resignation of Ro
bert W. Shingle, and has tentatively accepted. His permanent ac
ceptance is doubtful, however, on account of the fac: that the Star
Bulletin Publishing Co., of which he is manager, does a gicat deal cl
county workwhich would be discontinued if he aocepUd the office.
The mayor last night read his message to the hoard of supervisors
in which he asked for a bond issue for roads and city hall. Municipal
building should be built in Union sqtiaie.

Cavalry troops are to be added to the infantry establishment.

official, inspections, prior to March 31.

and may unintentionally drag the United States into a general war
with Mexico. Mexico, on the other hand, seems pleaded with the
decision of the American government regarding the Carrair.'i demand.

China, fell from a car on a moving
train belonging to Grove Farm at
an early hour last Wednesday
morning, was run over by the car

been riding was the next to the
last one of the train.
A Chinaman named Chow Kwai,
Japanese named K. Yoshimoto and

dent occurred. It is claimed by

turned low and was holding with
his hands: and was in that posi
tion when the car left the track.
The coroner's jury consisted of
. K. Raposa. H. C, Sheldon, W.

lowing verdict: "That Tong Lee
