El Paso Is Well Protected By Troops;
If Trouble Comes, Men Must Stay Home
i .
L PASO is protected for any emergency, but the authorities are not looking for any trouble.
The authorities have but one request to make of the people of the city and that is that in the event of
trouble which is iiost remote the men of the city remain in their homes, with their families, and not come
downtown. '
'.'The last thing we want or need is 'help' from the men of the city in the event of any sort of a clash," said an
official charged with the duty of maintaining order in El Paso. "We have an ample number of police, deputy sheriffs,
militia and soldiers to control any trouble that might occur. For men to rush down town in idle curiosity or in the
belief that they would be a help, will only hinder us in our work. We hope ever) rsife in El Paso leill help us lo keep
every husband at home irt any crisis that arises. The more men who come downtown, the more trouble the troops and
police will have."
The Eighth cavalry will remain at Fort Bliss, so will the battery of artillery .ow there and the half regiment of
the 20th infantry, accorcjjig to present plans, and the Seventh infantry, which took station last night in Cotton addi
tion, is to remain there. The 23d infantry, nov en route ' ere ' -rn Galveston, is also to take station here, according
to information given the peace and other civic off cials in El Paso.
With the additio a! police and deputy si riffs now on duty and the militia company at the courthouse, officials
say there is absolutely r dang;r p' their not beinc able to control any situation that might arise here, though the
chances are ery remote for anything other than ordinary conditions to prevail.
