department agents along the border j
reported today that General Car-;
ranza has received the American \
government's note, accepting his proposal
for a reciprocal agreement for j
the pursuit of outlaws and is favor-(
ably Impressed with It.
The state department was foraml- i
ly advised of the receipt by General
Carranza of the reply sent yesterday
to his proposals lor a reciprocal
agreement as to the pursuit of bandits
along the border. Unofficial information
reached the department'
that the American note was favorably
received by General Carranza
but the official messages made no
comment on that point.
The department haa not renewed
its' standing order urging Americans
to stay out of Mexico for tbe time
being but It was indicated that the
attention of consuls in Mexico might
be again directed to those instructors.
It is assumed that Consul Canada
at Vera Cruz acted under the j

"Judge Robinson is : too well
