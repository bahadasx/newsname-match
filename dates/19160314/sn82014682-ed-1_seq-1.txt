CAUSES
INFANT "MORTALITY."
: ''-""'; .:. -". ; By Mrs. E.'ot; Kllbourne. ' ''.:'" ''
This is the second of the series' of short papers published this week
as educational work in preparation or Honolulu's "Paby Week." . The
third will be published tomorrow, the topic Being "The Purposes, of Pre
, Tentive Organixations," by Miss Jessie Rae of the Pacific Sanitarium.
: The majority of deaths in infants is duo directly or indirectly to de
rangements of digestion; brought on by improper feeding. : When breast
: fed. tlie Uaby may be a vlctlnj of a disease of the mother, or may not de
rive sufficient nourishment, from the mother's milk, and so has little ability
to combat acute infectious disease, as tuberculosis, measles, scarlet fever,
et cetera. 'A .like condition may result from the babyls inability to nurse
proierly because of nasal obstruction, or-cleft palate. A baby may take
plenty of nourishment, but because df some congenital inability to assimi-.
late it, may waste away helplessly before the eyes of its parents.
In bottle fed babies, the' milk, the' bottles or the methods of feeding
may be at fault Milk may be deficient in fats or proteids. adulterated or
. dirty from bad handling. The dirty milk is germ laden and causes intestinal
putrefaction. A very, common mistake in feeding-and one that contributes
: largely to the infant death rate is the pernicious habit of some mothers of
'warming over the milk for successive feedings. Such warmed over milk
. is necessarily half sour and indigestible.
1 y Overfeeding contributes as largely as underfeeding to digestive disturb
ances.;; ,v '' : : v '. : ''..':.'''
The acute infectious diseases m easier scarlet fever, whooping cough,
et cetera, although serious at all. tim es, furnish a smaller mortality In
- these inlands than' in cold, wintry climates. However, each year they caust
the death of many infants, and manj of these could be saved by proper 4
. care and treatment. " ; .
Thd sad feature of infant mortality is that, by proper methods, most of
it could be prevented. . . - ' .;-'-
