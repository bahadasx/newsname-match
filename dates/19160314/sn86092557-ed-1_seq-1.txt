Natural Attitude
Tho. following, comment on the
"Rot" editorial in The Times was
handed into The West Virginian
yesterday by a prominent citizen,
whose name will be given to any
who wish to know, If they will call
at tli9 editorial rooms of The West
Virginian in person:
"In yesterday's issue of the Fair
mont Times there appears an edi
torial under the caption "Rot," in
which the Rev. Dr. Mahood, the
evangelist now preaching in our
city, and some of his utterances in
last night's sermon are attacked.
The editorial ought not to surprise
readers of the Times. Its vlcious
nes* is out of the ordinary, hut Its
position is in line with the general
editorial polici' of the Times. A
perusal of thef flies of the Times
will plainly show that from time to
time it has attacked ministers, and
churches, and revivals, and forces
of' righteousness generally.. Tho
peoplo of Fairmont respect its
ministry, support its churches, tie
lUve in revivals and a day of reck
oning awaits such an utterance as'
appeared In the Times yesterday
-morning."
ffl?ITJ|?IN
Number of old Actions Were
Dropped From List
Today.
Tlio Circuit Court devoted the day
to devising the docket and hearing of
pleadings in equity. A number ot old
cases that have been carried over
were dropped from the docket by the
operation of the four 'year rule. Sev
eral cases were reported as having
been settled out ot court, so these
actions were dropped. The attorneys
of other appeal actions In law, an
nounced that they were ready to have
their cases heard.at this term.
This afternoion was devoted to the
argument of the attorneys in several
cases in equity. Chief among these is
the case ot the Monongahela Valley
Traction company vs. The Fairmont
and Mannlngton Railroad company.
ThlB plea is for the discovery of the
books ot the Mannlngton company in
order to determine the amount of the
outstanding obligations of the defend
ant at the time that it was taken over
by the M. V. T. Co., remain unpaid. K.
M. Showaiter is the attornoy for the
defendant and G. M. Alexander repre
sents the plaintiff. No decision in any
case had been given at a late hour
this evening.
Witnesses before the Grand Jury
were sworn by the clerk at various
times throughout the day. The Grand
Jury continued in session behind
closed doors today and no Indictments
have as yet been returned.

DR. TAYLOR WILL
TALK TONIGHT ON
AMUSEMENTS
Evangelist at the Christian
Church to Discuss Inter
esting Topic.
Tonight Dr. Taylor, the evangelist
at the Christian church, will speak on
a subject now seemingly uppermost
in the minds of the people outside
and inside the church. Dr. Taylor will
discuss the theme under the caption,
"Amusements'?Their Danger and
Blessing".
Last night the church was crowded.
Dr. Mitchell land Ills congregation
were happily surprised at the out
pouring of people for the first Mon
day service. The Christianchurch peo
ple are delighted at the beginning of
the> work1 of Evangelists Taylor and
Adams. "
Dr. Taylor's jSermon w*8 on, "This*
Prevailiri^{Ctiurch":' It was a master
piece of victory and sound reasoning.
The message was full of comfort to
the Christian and sound argument,'
demanding the consideration of men
and women out of the church. The
musical program last evening was a
delightful one. The violin solo by Earl
Adams was most pleasing as well as
his solo work. The big chorus was at
its best and the congregation joined
most lustily in the congregational
singing.
Tonight the citizens of Fairmont
will be anxious to hear Dr. Taylor
on the amusement question. Come
early for a good seat.

inspiring song service led by the choir,
atterwhlch Rev. J. B. Workman
preached a very able and practical
sermon on "The Price, Power and Re
ward of Thorough Equipment as Sav
iors of Men." The appeal was to the
church, and following the sermon,
upon invitation of the pastor the altar
and all the space about it was filled
with Christian people who came for
ward seeking the power of the Holy
Spirit and to renew" their convenant
with God.
There seems to be an unusual leadl
ness on the part of the church to re
spond to the call for service and- a
spirit of expectancy is manifest which
reaches even the people who are out
side the church. .
Tonight the song service will he
gin at 7:30 and the sermon wll be on

Ministers Thank West Virginian
Fairmont, W. Va., March 14, 1916 [Editor of The West Virginian:]?
On behalf of the members of the Ministerial Association of Fairmont I
wish to thank you and to give some expression of our appreciation of your
able and high toned editorial as published in yesterday's West Virginian
relative to the "Rot" which appeared in the Fairmont Times, very prop
erly labelled yesterday morning
As a body of ministers we appreciate your stand, editorially, on the
great moral issues which from time to time are before the public; and
we especially appreciate and commend your editorial referred to.
Dr. Mahood needs no defense and is abundantly able to take care of
himself; but principles, for which all the great churches of Christendom
stand, have been wantonly and ecurriously assailed and we appreciate
your readiness to rebuke such a cowardly attack.
We believe that your attitude will meet- with the approval o! the
Christian community in which your paper circulates'and we most heartily
assure you of our appreciation.
1 am respectfully yours, .
J. B. WORKMAN, President^Fairmont Ministerial Association.
