VI I'ii-o. Texas, March 14.
Villa, heading Minlh from Galena,
i now encircled by Carranza
troops, according to advices from
General Luis Gutierrez, command
er in chief of Chihuahua today.
'With 1.1,000 men in Chihuahua and
heavy reinforcements on their way
from the division of General Cal
ks in Sonera, he thinks Villa has
small chance of escape.
El Paso, Texas, March 14 A cir
cumstantial story reached here today
from Mexican sources to the effect
that Villa had once more changed
his plans and intended making a stand
against the American punitive expedi
tion at Ojitos pass, the narrow gap in
!iie western Chihuahua Sierras
through which he made his murderous
dash on Columbus.
Is Strategic Position.
Americans familiar with the coun
try assert that the Ojitos pass is ad
mirably adapted for a successful de
fense if Villa really intends to risk
an open engagement with the Amer
ican troops and does not try to evade
and use guerilla tactics. The fron
tier country between here and Colum
bus is showing unmistakable signs
that it. is beginning to feel the ner
vous strain tiiat has been increasing
in tension since the Columbus raid.
Stories of the activities of Villa
agents have poured into Fort Bliss.
Several arrests already have been
made. One story is that Villa sym
pathizers are using dogs to send
messages and information across the
border. An American said he had
seen a dog with a roll or papers lieu
about his neck, running across the
border. He fired several bullets at the
animal but failed to hit it.
Supplies Arriving.
In the meantime trainloads of mili
tary supplies continue to arrive here
or pass through on their way to other
points on the international line. Keen
interest is shown in the aeroplane
squadron w hich is reported on its way
from San Antonio. The 23rd infantry
which was ordered to entrain at Gal
veston is expected here late today.
Hear Plans of Attack.
Naco, Ariz., JdUrch 14. Naco was
under arms during the night as the
result of reports from sources con
sidered reliable by military author
ities that a raid on the town was
planned for the early morning hours.
Following reports early last night
that Villa sympathizers at Cananea,
Sonora, were threatening trouble, the
wires between that town and the bor
der were cut.
The authorities here also learned
of several pieces of artillery hidden
In a house at Nogales, Sonora, and
that Mexican soldiers had been carry
ing what appeared to be ammunition
to the place.
In Naco, the patrols were instructed
to "shoot to kill" anyone found trying
to burn, houses or who refused to halt

Amends for
Last Sinking
Washington, March 11. Austria
has presented to the United States
reports of two instances In which
it is charged Austrian merchant
ships were torpedoed without
warning by allied submarines,
presumably British.
Washington, March 14. Unofficial
advices received here today indicate
that Germany will make complete
amends to the United States if it is
found that a German submarine tor
pedoed the Norwegian bark Silius
from which seven Americans were res
cued in Havre roads.
The German government is repre
sented here as believing that a torpedo
was not responsible for the loss of the
bark and that any commander who at
tacks a neutral ship such as the Silius
without warning would be exceeding
his instructions.
American consul Osborne at Havre
reported that the ship was torpedoed
without warning. His report was based
on statements of American survivors.
Officials are inclined to entertain the
possibility that the ship might have
been struck by a mine but the case is
being investigated further.
TO ENLARGE ARMY
TO 120,000 MEN
Washington, March 14. A resolu
tion will be introduced in congress
probably tomorrow to permit the war
department to raise the standing army
to the full strength of the various units
which will be about 120,000 men.
Senators who were consulted by
house leaders and war department offi
cials asserted late today that the in
crease to be authorized by the house
resolution would add approximately
8,000 or 9,000 men to the regiments
now on the Mexican border, bringing
that force up to a total of about 27,000
men.
The present stjength pMhe army is
about 87,000 in en. TEe additional
troops are desired to fill the places of
men who may be withdrawn from their
present locations for service in Mex
ico. ( hieago Banks Have $1,300,000,000.
Chicago, March 14. According to
reports issued by Chicago banks the
total of deposits today is approximate
ly $1,300,000,000, a new record in local
banking circles. Loans amount fco
nearly $900,000,000, which is also a
record for local banks.
THE WAR
TODAY
Activities on the Verdnn front
continue to be chiefly those of the
artillery arm, which still is being
vigorously employed.
Xo infantry attack by the Ger
mans lias developed west of the
Meuse, where there have been
signs that a renewal of the drive
was in prospect. The (ierman ef
fort, indeed, seems to have again
shifted in its most intensive form
to the other bank of the stream,
where a reconnaissance in force,
In the Haudremont wood, west of
Douaumont, is reported by Paris
to have been checked by the
French curtain of tire.
Southeast of Douaumont, in the
region of Vaux and Damloup, the
violent (ierman bombardment con.
tin lies, while further south, in the
Woevre region, both (ierman and
French guns are busy pounding
opposing positions.
There Is increasing friction be
tween Greece and the entente
powers, according to advices from
(ierman sources. These declare
that Premier Skouloudis has noti
fied the entente ambassadors that
the Greek government is indispos
ed to transfer to the entente the
administration of railroads in
northern Greece and Macedonia, to
withdraw troops from the Macedo
nian region, and to meet other re
quests by the entente.
French and (ierman aviators
have had many combats in the air
recently with the advantage in fa
vor of the French, according to
Paris. A French air squadron
dropped more than a hundred
bombs back of the German lines
north of Verdun. At least three
German aeroplanes are declared to
have been brought to earth.

CENSORSHIP APPLIED
Funston Refuses to Talk and
Shuts Off All the Other
Sources of News.
San Antonio, March 14. Xo orders
for a movement across the border
were issued from Fort Sam Houston
this niorning and none are likely to
day. General Funston said that from
now on he would refuse to answer
questions concerning the imminence
of the expeditionary force's departure.
A rigid censorship was irdered es
tablished at Columbus, N. M., today by
Major General Frederick Funston. He
instructed Brigadier General John J.
Pershing, commanding there to take
charge of the telegraph office, watch
all automobile routes and guard tele
phone wires out of town. This step
was taken to prevent news of the
troop movements leakin out in press
dispatches.
"ews Proves Handicap.
General Funston said that newspa
per reports from New Mexico had
been revealing every movement of
troops, the disposition of the various
forces and the amount of their equip
ment. "There was no use of trying to con
ceal our plans here while there was a
leak on the border," he explained. "We
i had to act." It was.ind.icated that if the
censorship ordered today was evaded"
j military law might be the next step
in controlling the new situation at Co
lumbus.
Bell Put in Command.
It was announced today that Briga
dier General George Bell Jr., com
mander of the 5th brigade with head
quarters at San Antonio had been or
dered to El Paso to take command of
the troops there, relieving General
Pershing now at Columbus.
General Bell will not be under Gen
eral Pershing, but will have charge of
the border situation when General
Pershing's advance into Mexico is be
gun. He will operate under the orders
of General Funston.
Pershing Sent to Columbus.
El Paso, Texas, March 14 Brigadier
General John J. Pershing, command
ing the American expeditionary force
into Mexico, left here on a westbound
train last night and since his depart
ure, military authorities have refused
all information about him.
General Pershing's train was said
here to be going to Columbus, N. M.,
where today some 4,000 men of the
first expeditionary force are in readi
ness for the dash after Villa. Some
hours after General Pershing left here,
however, it became evident that mili
tary authorities in this section intend
ed that no information should leak out
about his further movements.
Eludes Newspaper Men.
In expectation of the general's de
parture last night from El Paso, a
crowd of photographers and moving
picture men had gathered at a railway
platform. Piles of military equipment
and bulky army wagons were scat
tered about the train. General Persh
ing, instead of walking down the lane
which the photographers had formed,
stepped behind an army wagon and
thence to the opposite side of the car.
The, train was about to pull out when
the farewell crowd discovered that
the general had out maneuvered them.
ARREST MAN FOR
DOUBLE MURDER
Butcher Is Held as Slayer of Two Com
petitors in Chicago Meat Market
Revenge Motive!
Chicago, March 14 Victor Dobricky,
a butcher, has been arrested in con
nection with the murder of William
Bindrim, 79 years old, and his son,
George, 39, whose bodies were found
yesterday morning in the butcher
shop owned by the elder Bindrim. Hair
found in the hand of George Bindrim
is identical with that of Dobricky the
police say.
The police contend that the murder
was committed for revenge and not for
robbery as a considerable sum of
money was found undisturbed in the
shop on Monday.
A meat cleaver had been used by the
murderer.

Washington, Man- tr li.- Tbe state
department was formally advised of
the receipt by General ('arranza of
the reply sent yesterday to his pro
posals for a reciprocal agreement as
to the pursuit of bandits along the
border. Unofficial information reached
the department that the American
note was favorably received by Gen
eral Carranza but the official mes
sages made no comment on that point.
The department has not renewed its
standing order urging Americans to
stay out of Mexico for the time being
but news dispatches indicate Consul
Canada at Vera Cruz acted under the
standing order.
Although the Mormon colony at'
Casas Grandes is protected by a Car
ranza garrison, it is said, one of the
first movements of the American
forces probably will be in that direc
tion. Acting Secretary Polk reported to
President Wilson today that word re
ceived at the state department from
various sections of Mexico indicated
that a favorable impression had been
made by the note sent General Car
ranza yesterday and the president's
assurances that no armed interven
tion in Mexico was planned.
Mr. Polk's report was optimistic
and did not confirm reports that the
Carranza supporters resented the
pursuit of Villa by American troops.

many weeks the secretary has been
working steadily in a heavy pressure
