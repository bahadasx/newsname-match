Columbus today grew to a military es

announced today, will be the leader of

Plans Talked Of.
Officers here talked of a march
straight southward in pursuit of Vil
la. Troop movements seemed to bear
out reports that while the Columbus
column is striking south another
movement will be made from the vi
einity of El Paso and a third from
the Arizona line somewhere near
louRlas. Both the El Paso and Done.
las movements would be able to fol
low rail lines, while the central col
umn from here would have to go ver-
lanu across a desert.
B?licf here tonight was that the Co
lumbus column would be ready to start

BLUNT CRITICISM OF
PREPAREDNESS PLANS
By Allan L. Benson Before the House
Naval Committee.
Washington, March 13. Allan L.
Benson -of Yonkers, Y socialist
candidate for the presidential nomina
tion, criticized President Wilson's ad
vocacy of preparedness in such blunt
terms before the house naval commit
tee today that Chairman Padgett ex
punged the remarks from the record.
He was permitted to continue his ar
gument against war preparations after
being warned that the committee'
would not tolerate further improper,
references to the president.
Mr. Benson angrily protested against
the chairman's attitude, saying he
would withdraw if he was before "a
Russian cWnmittee."
Representative Roberts of Massachu
setts, republican, urged that the wit
ness be allowed to make his statement)
witnout interrerence, out tne chairman
sustained objections by Representa
tives Oliver of,, Alabama and Talbott of
Maryland, democrats, who had inter
posed when Mr. Benson declared flatly
that the president had said what he
knew to be untrue when he asserted
in his Cleveland speech that the coun
try should prepare for defense at once
and that nobody knew what the next
day might bring forth.

Alleged Immoral
Acts in Sing Sing
PROSECUTION TRYING TO PROVE
WITH OSBORNE'S KNOWLEDGE
THE OLD STORY RETOLD
James Harvey, a Prison Inmate, on
Whose Story Previous Inquiries
Were Held Was Called is a Witness.
White Plains, N. Y, March 13. Tes
timony designed to ehow that Thomas
Mott Osborne had full knowledge of
alleged immoral conditions at Sing
Sing prison while he was warden there
waa brought out by the prosecution at
the trial of Osborne which began to
day. William Willett. Jr.. a former
congressman, who was imprisoned in
Sing Sing prison for buying a supreme
court judgeship nomination in Wueer.a
county, and James Harvey, a'so a
prison inmate, were the principal wit
nesses against Osborne. The indict
ment against the former warden,
charging perjury, is based on his testi
mony last October before Dr. Rudolph
Diedling. a state prison commissioner,
who conducted an investigation at Sin"
Sing. Osborne testified before Dr.
Diedling that "there is no immorality
so far as the prison is concerned."
Documentary Evidence Admitted.
Harvey, on whose story of immoral
ity three inquiries of Sine Sing prison
were conducted, had testified to o n
ditions there wnen Willett. now com
pleting at the Great Meadows prison
the sentence imposed after his convic
tion, was called as a witness. His
testimony as to the extent of Osborne'o
knowledge of the alleged immoral con
ditions was assisted by Assistnnt Dis
trict Attorney William J. Fallon with
documentary evidence in the form of
Mutual Welfare league complaint and
punishment slips, which were admitted
into the record. These papers, taken
from the files at Sing Sing, recited the
charges and showed the sentences im
posed by the league on its offending
members. This organization was in
augurated by Osborne in aid his "re
form from within" plan.
Sought to Prove Witness Was Dis
gruntled. Through cross examination of Wil
lett, George Gordon IVattle, counsel for
Osborne, sought to bring out that Wil
lett. disgruntled because Osborne had
denied him special privileges at Sing
Sing, had aided the prosecution in the
preparation of the perjury accusation
in the hope that he would soon be
paroled. Willett denied this.
When Harvey told- before the -welfare
ll.igue of his immoral relations
with officers of the Mutual Welfare
league, it was Willett who presided, at
Osborne's request, he testified. As a
result of Harvey's recital, Osborne con
ducted an Inquiry during which the ac
cused officers at first denied but later
admitted their miilt. The documents
Introduced by Mr. Fallon showed that
18 members were suspended from the
league and decided to appeal to the
warden.
Not Promised a Parole.
Willett denied that Mr. Weeks or
John B. Riley, then state superintend
ent of prisons, had promised him pa
role or ommutation of sentence in re
turn for assistance, or that he was
hostile to Osborne, because the latter
bad opposed a parole bill pending in
the legislature.
Attorney Battle said tonight that he
would refrain from calling any wit
nesses. Including Osborne himself, "if
the prosecution brings out nothing
more serious than it did today."
