Senator Banks, who was presen
while the interview with Senator Mc
Laurin. published in Friday's Heralc
and News was being given, said that h<

Northern trip, at Senator McLaurin':

tions, and that* he was satisfied wi*t
the result of the trip. In connectior
witth the insurance question it migh
be well, he said, to ca^l attention t(
what had been done through the StaN
sinking fund commission.
? "About fi.teen years ago there wai
enacted a law, known as the DeBruh
law, authorizing the State Sinkin*
k fund commission to carry forty-fiv<
percent, of t'he insurance on Stai<
buildings, and providing that when <
H prvilt 1>1 l?U UUUUl^U LUUUOUUU UV1
lars was accumulate that this department
of the government should carrj
this insurance for the State free o
I charge. At the last -.session of th<
^ legislature there was a bill introducB
?d to provide that the activities of this
department should be extended tc
carrying rorty-vve per ceni. 01 m<
insurance on public school building*
^ in the State, and enlarging the profll
fund to one million dollars. Mr. Davie
W H. Heans, clerk of the Sinking Fund
commission, appeared -before the fln
t?ance committee of the Senate and explained
the operations of this department,
and from him the following interesting
facts were obtained:
"During the lo years of operation o
the insurance law there were premiums
received amounting to two. hun^
dred and twenty thousand dollars
only twenty housand dollars, of twc
o- wnicn were paia out ior nve losses
J0 leaving a clear profit on a business
^ o two hundred thousand dollars. In
other words for every ollar paid in 9C
cents remained as profit and ten cents
| was paid out for losses. This was
' very interesting information to the
finance committee of the senate, and
indicates the possibi ities of an ecc"^
omical management o: insurance affairs
in the State, which would be
m well for thoughtful men to consider.
"In discussing the securities offer
r ed through the State warehouse system,
with ftie governor of the Federal
reserve board in Richmond, he stated
that one of the difficulties of that
H office had been the carelessness and
lack of system which had been com
mon amen? warehousemen in the
South, and he .was unstinted in hi?
praise o the remarkable ;vork donr
by Warehouse Commissioner MeLaurin
in providing a thoroughly sntfsfacV

All vhese things a<-o complimentary
and Mr. Domiuick appreciates the
fact that he should be considered favorably
or these positions, but when
J asked about them, he replied thai he
had never had any idea ol" being a
! candidate for anything or any petition
i
j apart from representative in congress
: from tlie third d'sirict, and that he
would be in that race this summer. ,
; Xo doubt, some of the other aspirI
ants for this posi.ion would be pleased
ro see Mr Dominick in some other race
for by getting him out o. the congres'

the State warehouse system, as th
t managers in the State system were
- State officials, appointed and superi
vised by the commissioner, and that
j he would write Senator McLaurin a
5 letter explaining this.
"While we were in New York we
^ were invited to dine with Mr. Theo^
dore H. Price, editor of Commerce
t and Finance, and Dr. Lawrence Ab
bott, edifor of Outlook. This gave us
a fine opportunity of ascertaining
through these notable magazine editors
the attitude of this country tc
Mr. Wilson's administration, and we
were very much gratified to find that,
one being a Democrat and the othe;
a Republican, they were united in his

Anderson, S. C.
Dear Coionei:
I am this day in receipt of the folio
w'ns: communication:
"Hon. Cole. L. Blcase,
"Columbia. S. C.
"Dear Sir:
"What is your idea as 10 the aboli--'nn
of the oountv-tocounty campaign
J r.i.is year? Are you in favor of going
be ore the people as ^heretofore, or f
having a newspaper campaign? Are
you opposed to the county-to-county
campaign?
"A prompt answer will be appreciated.
"Yours truly,
"V. B. Cheshire, Editor,
"The Fanners' Tribune.
> In reply thereto, if you "will excuse
' me. I will take the questions up back1
wards.
As to your third question, I am not
' opposed to the county-to-county campaign.
but favor it.
i
As to your second question, I am in
favor of going before the people as
heretofore, and expect to do so countyL
io-county campaign or not, as no set
i
of political henchmen can bridle my
tongue or prevent me i rom speaking
to the people of South Carolina who
wish to hear me. 1 am absolutely opposed
to a newspaper campaign.
Xcfw, as to your first question, as to
I
my idea in reference to tlie abolition,
I c? the county-to-county campaign tnls
year, I beg to say that my first idea is
that it is a scheme'because some people
are a raid to face their records in
i
a county-to-county campaign. My
second idea is that it is an effort on
, ihe part of certain newspapers to give
1 -V? , AnnAufnnift? tr\ nnKlicVt OnV
, lilt in iue uppuuuun.i iu [/UUIIOH U.HJ
kind of a lie and then re.'use to puib>
iish the correction when the demand
i is made on them as has been frequently
done. I presume that I wftild "have
less to lose by abolishing the Stat*
campaign than any other man personally
because I am thoroughly
known throughout the State of -South
Carolina, even to the children; every
body knows me and know what I
sta'id for in politic-;. Therefore, it
would not be necessary for me to go
around over the Staie staring my position
on public questions, but it would
be very unjust to the unknown men
I in Dolitics. not only in this campaign.
but in all others, to deprive them of:
the privilege o meeting the people
,
' face to face it would certainly be
manifestly unfair to the people of the
State to attempt to deprive them of
,he privilege of seeing the candidates
' Are* trv fare* nf intfe-insr what manner
of men they are and of hearing them
express their views personally. The
old crowd who used to control South
Carolina would meet in their county
seats, fix up a little slate, go into a
convention and fore e it down the
throats of the people, whether they
wanted it or not, and, if the people protested,
they would be told, "if you
don't support this ticket the nigger is
liable to come in.-> Then, the State
crowd would meet in Columbia at the,
i
Columbia 'Clu'b, iake a few drinks o:
mean liquor, light up cigars and fix up
a slate for all State offices; .go into a
self-packed convention and nominate
it (their ticket) and force the white
people of the State to support them.
This was broken up in 1S90, and every J
white man in the State, poor or rich, j
was given the same privilege to say ,
who should hold these public offices. '
This lias worked remarkably well and
svr- 'ssfuily ana the only reason they
"an give for changing the plan is to

Sometime, when life's lc<?ons have

The things which our weak judgments

The things o'er which we grieved

And we shall see how all God's plans

And how what seemed reproof was

Phillips Brooks wrote once: "There
is contagion in a sweet and .'beautiful
character, for health is contagious as
well as disease. We are all the time
giving to others either wholesome or
unwholesome moods?poisoning thei*
atmosphere with doubt and suspicion,
or clearing it with hope.ulness and
good cheer." And that is true. JTihe
all-wise creator has placed something
wj*hin each one that tells him wnetner
he has done the right or not. And
whenever that voice ceases t.o speak
you had better take heed. There is
something wrong. It does not matter
:o much what other people say about
to:;, or even think about you. butj.what
can you say about yourself and what*
do you think about yourself when no
one is arcund and you are all alone
communing with your own soul. James
A. Garfield said once. "it doesni
matter mueh what other people think
of me, but it matters tremendously
what James A. Garfield thinks of me.'And
George Washington?you have no
doubt heard of him?gave a very excellent
recipe for worry about what
people were saying and thinking about
you when he said: "If anyone speats
evil o. you, so live that no offe will
believe him.'* Think or these things. . ^
They are worth your while to think /'
about. But let me tell you something1 /
else to think about at the same time. / N
If you are living and basking in tfye
sunshine and have no concern for / ;
are indifferent to welfare of your most *
/
unfortunate neighbor?and the ^fhole
world is your neighbor?who lives in
the shadow, then you are not lining up
to either one of these precepts. II just
want to make you think a little.
