GOVERNOR MEETS
HIS WAR CHIEFS
.
"Nothing lo Say at This Time,"
Says Executive After
Meeting
Governor Brumbaugh held a war
j council at his offices at the Capitol
' early this afternoon, but declined to
discuss the effect of his announcement
that he would permit the use of his
name at the Republican presidential
preference primary. The Governor
has been receiving letters and tele*
; irami from friends commending his
I candidacy and men connected with the
: Stan Government have assured him
of their support.
The Governor was in consultation
i with Attorney General Brown, Public
1 Service Chairman Ainey, Secretary of
! Agriculture Patton and Harry A.
I Mackey, chairman of the Workmen's
Compensation Board. The presence
of these men being closeted with the
Governor led to them being styled the
"Big I-'our" in the gossip of the Cap
itol this afternoon.
When the Governor left the confer
! ence he was-asked if he had anything
■ to say.
"No, not now," he replied.
"Are you talking over the situation
with those officials in there?" was
I asked.
VOh, no, they are just in there
I working out some problems," said the
; Governor. He refused to sav any
] more.
The Governor said that he had not
seen ex-Secretary P. C. Knox while
! he was here last evening on his way
I to York.
One of the things which attracted
attention at the Capitol was the fact
that Senator <"harles A. Snyder, candi
date for Auditor General, wus here.
He did not meet the Governor. ' A.
Xevin Detrieh. chairman of the Wash
ington , party State committee, and
P. S. Ache, one of the militant Bull
| Moosers in 1912, were also on the

The German government is repre

of the bark and that any commander
who attacks a neutral ship such as
the Silius without warning would be
exceeding his instructions.

The committee regrets any over

matter of invitations to this tirst ban
quet, which, it is expected, will be
I made an annual affair, but the difli
culty in obtaining authentic lists of the
graduates from the various universities
made it almost impossible to reach
; everybody. William H. Earnest will
j be toastmaster, and in addition to the ;
i speakers whose names were printed in
• last evening's Telegraph, Headmaster
i, Arthur 10. Brown, of the Harrisburg
Academy, will be called on for a few
remarks appropriate to the occasion
President E. E. Sparks, of State Col
lege. will bo the guest of honor.
Miss Sara Leiner's orchestra will
furnish the music, which will include
the representative songs of all the col- I
! leges. The banquet is scheduled for
7 o'clock to-morrow evening. AH
those who have not replied cither way
to the invitations are urged to do so
I to-day, inasmuch as it is very hard for
the committee io make arrangements
; for an uncertain number. After 110011
to-morrow it will be impossible to
make further provision, and all who

on the recent wreck at Mexico, on the I
Middle division of the Pennsylvania
Railroad. He says:
"If '.lie rules of safety are to be ,

results have accompanied the move

i of the employers to the conference. I
i The statistics gathered will be laid
j before the meeting and the co-opcra- ;
1 tion of everyone asked to reduce the

speak. i
j The Idea originated with the He- !
