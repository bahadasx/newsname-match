IISGRAGEFUL SCENES
AT FRANKFORT
TVv SnhiwiMl tn "fiaf"
Ensues Green and Harvey. Object to
Being Choked Off
GUNS ARE FLASHED IN HOUSE
Frankfort, Ky., March 18. Bit
terness engendered by the liquor
question reached its climax in the
House of Representatives this after
noon when the "dry" members, in
furiated by the arbitrary rulings of
-Acting Speaker Harry J. Meyers and
the methods used to enforce them,
burst forth in turbu'ent and unani-'
mous rebellion, demanding the ex
pulsion from the floor of the seven
so called assistants to the Sergeant-at-Arms,
appointed Saturday by
Speaker H. C. DuJTy.
Scenes or turbulence were enacted
which completely eclipsed all form
er disorder seen during this session,
and which are declared to be with
out parallel in histoiy ot the Ken
tuckv Legislature.
Executive Marshal B. Williams,
one of seven so called "assistant
Sergeant:" drew a huge revolver on
Representative V. B Harvey, of
Webster county, who- had refused to
recognize his authority, but was in
stantly seized. Rumors are current
that other guns were flashing in the
chamber, but they can. not be sub
stantiated. The galleries, crowded to their ut
most capacity, were in an uproar,
cheering the "dry" leadersat the top
of their lungs and hissing Acting
Speaker Meyers and the so-called
assistants to the Sergeant-at-Arm's.
Agrees Tc Recognition
The-tumult, after raging for about
half n hour, subsided slowly after
Meyers had consented to grant rec.
ognition to a representative of the
"drys."
The storm was the outgrowth oi
the refusal of the Rules Committee
to bring out Senator Taylor's anti
shipment bill, which limits the
amount of liquor and beer that can
be shipped into dry territory. The
"drys," possessing a Urge majority,
desired to make a motion to suspend
the rules and bring up this bill any
way. The czar-like methods em
ployed to prevent their making such
a motion led to the outbreak.

COLUMBES, N. M., Ajarch 13.
With Villa reported to have chang
ed his course and now said to be
moving eastward toward the Mexican
Central Railroad, General John J.
Pershing arrived here tonight to take
charge of the main forces of the pun
itive expedition'twhich will enter
Mexico in quest of the band of ban

along the international line,
Commands now at Columbus
muster approximately 3,500 men.
Altogether there are 12,000 troops
with forty mountain field guns and
batteries between Douglas, Ariz, and
ElPaso tonight, aline 200 miles long.
A little more than one third of this
contingent is cavalry.
Several other commands are ex

ing to make the column to move out

expeditionary force with field wire
less and aeroplane equipment.'

Gen, Pablo Bertani, commanding
ihe garrison of 2,000 Carranza troops

for Villa to enter easily, with his
present start.
