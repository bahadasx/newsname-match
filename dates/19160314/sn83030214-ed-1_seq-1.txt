Wilson's Reply to Carranza
Granting His Request.
Washingttn , March tS.?President Wilson's reply to
(?ti'i-ral Carranza's request thai Mexican troops be per?
mitted to cross the border in pursuit of bandits follows:
The government of the United States lias received
the courteous note of Senor Aruna and hau read with
satisfaction his Buggestion for reciprocal privileges to
the American and Mexican authorities in the pursuit
awl apprehension of outlaws who infest their respective
territories lying along the international boundary and
who are a constant menace to the lives and property of
residents of th;it region.
The government of the United Sta'?ss. in \ iew of the
unusual state of affair* which has existed for some time
along the international boundary and earnestly desiring
to cooperate with the de facto government of Mexico to
suppress this state of lawlessness, of which the recent
attack on Columbus. X. M., is a deplorable example, and
ii? insure peace and order in the region contiguous to
the boundary between the two republics, readily grants
permission for military forces of the de facto govern?
ment of Mexico to cross the international boundary in
pursuit of lawless bands of armed men who have en?
tered Mexico from the United states, committed out?
rages on Mexican soil and fled int<? the United States, on
the understanding thai ?the de facto government of
Mexico grants the reciprocal privilege thai the militai''
forcea of the United .State.*- may pursue across the inter?
national boundary into .Mexican territory lawtese banil.*
of armed m?-n who ha\e entered the United States from
Mexico, committed outrages on American soil and fled
into .Mexico.
The government of the United States understands
that, in ? lew of its agreement to this reciprocal arrange?
ment, proposed by the de lacio government, the arrange?
ment i.* now complete and in force, and th?' reciprocal
privileges thereunder may ai-cordingly be exercised by
either government without further interchange of \ lews.
It is a matter of sincere gratification to tin- govern?
ment of the United States that the de facto government
of Mexico has evinced so cordial and friendly a spirit of
cooperation in th?' efforts <>f the authorities of the United
States to apprehend and punish the bands of outlaws
who seek refuge beyond the international boundary in
tl?.v ? rroneous '""lief that the cen.*.titute?l authorities will
resent any pursuit across the bountlary b\ the forces of
the govenimenl whose citizens have suffered by the
crimes of the fugitives.
With the same spirit of cordial friendship the gov?
ernment of the United States will exercise the privilege
granted by the de facto government of Mexico in th?
hope and confident expectation that by their mutual
efforts ?lawlessness will be eradicated and p?saee and
order maintained in the territories of the United States
and Mexico contiguous to the international boundary.
