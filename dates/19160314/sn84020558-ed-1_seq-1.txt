COPENHAGEN, March 13. (Via
Imdon) It now seems fairly settled
that the recent conference of Scandi
navian ministers of state was called
not because of any pending situation
f'eetin: Scandinavia as a whole, but
anticipatory of problems expected to
arise in the near future. It was con
sidered desirable especially by Swe
den, that the outlook be discussed and
the agreement be renewed for joint
action on questions affecting the threa
countries alike. This does not neces
sarily mean that these nations will
take up jointly any dispute of a single
country, but that they will be sure to
net vigorously together where the

HAVRE, March 14. A majority of
the crew of the Norwegian hark Si
lius, which was sunk in Havre roads
last Thursday, in statements to tne
Associated Press, declared today that
the bark had been torpedoed without
warning by a submarine and that the
vessel was unarmed.
The French steamer Luisiana and
the Silius be within a hundred yards
of each other. The Silius was sent
to the bottom half an hour after the
liner had gone down.
Of the seventeen members of the
crew of the. Silius, seven were Amer
ican vouth-novices who were making
their first voyage. They said they
signed because they wanted to "see
a little of the world." Charles Cun
liffe, 18 years old of Atlantic City,
explained that the bark had been
buffeted by tempests for 31 days be
fore the French coast was sighted.
The ship was carried for ntne days
out of her course and the crew has
been so overworked that they were
looking forward to reaching port and
had quit worrying a.bout seeing the
world. So tirede were the men that
they were not awakened by the ex
plosion whi; h sank the Luisidne close
by them, with the exception of John
Hartmann of Philadelphia. vho was
on deck and sustained a broken leg by
b"ing struck by a splinter. The ex
plosion wai a very strong one, crush
ing in the ship. Splinters of woikI
and other debris flew in all directions.
In three minutes after the detonation
all the men were in the water and
the Silius had sunk.
The crew expressed the belief that
it was a torpedo from a submarine
that stink the Silius. Two sailors saw
what they called a stake moving
through the water and which they
think might have been the periscope
of a submarine.
A French torpedo boat rescued all
the men except the captain who was
a Norwegian, and a Dane and another
Norwegian who were drowned. The
men were in the water twenty min
utes. Those drowned were lost while
trying to launch a boat.
John William Vongnlen, Henry Mon
ahan and Daniel Novak returning to
the United States on the British
steamer Tuxandrier, which is due to
arrive in New York about .fprill. The
other members of the crew will be

Masses of Troops Said to Be

Switching their activity from the
east to the northwest of Verdun,
the Germans are hammering at the
Salient of Le Morte Homme and the
region of the bois .Bourrus, in an en
deavor to bring their line further
south on the western flank of the
fortress.
To the east of the Mettse and in
the Woevre district there has been a
noticeable let. up in the bombard
ments of both sides. The infantry
everywhere on the Verdun front has
been inactive.
In line with the bombardment of
Le Morte Homme and the Bois Bour
rus, the Germans are assembling men
in the region between Forges and
the Bois Des Corbeaux, probably with
the intention of throwing them into
the fray should the intense bombard
ment meet with success. The French
artillery, however, have had this as
sembling point under the fire of
their guns. No advantage is claimed
by either side in the latest fighting
around the fortress.
Back of the German line to the
north of Verdun, a French air squad
ion dropped 130 bombs on the station
at Brieulles and at otner points around
Verdun. French and German avaitors
have met in combats in the air with
the advantage incontestably in favor
of the French according to Paris. At
least three German aeroplanes are
declared to have been brought down
while others were seen by the French
observers to have been in distress.
In the region of Seppois, upper
Alsace, the Germans essayed an at
tack on trenches that the French had
captured, but were repulsed with con
siderable casualties. The French guns
have done damage to German posi
tions north of the Aisne. in Cham
pagne and in the eastern portion of
the Forest of Argonr.e.
In northwest Russia around Riga,
in the Ikskull district, and on the
Jacobstadt sector there have been
violent artillery duels. In Galicia
southwest of Kolki and along the
middcl stripe river, the Russians have
been successful in small engagements
with the Teutons.
In the coastal region of the Cau
casus front the Russians are still
driving the Turks before them.
Lieutenant General Jan. Christian
Smuts, the former defense minister
of the I'nion of South Africa and
now commander of the British ex
pedition against German east Africa,
had stiff engagements with the Ger
mans in the mountainous regions west
of Everta, along the frontier. The
Germans were driven back, although
the fighting was of the most ob
stinate character. The British are
endeavoring to cut off the retreating
of the (iermans, who are withdrawing
to the south.
Unofficial advices are that Admiral
Von Tirpitz, the German minister of
Marine, is ill and that the ministry is
in charge of another official.
ROME. March 13. ( 1,i i ml oil

statement was issued by the Italian

urged that the witness be allowed to
make his statement without interfer
ence, but the chairman sustained ob

Mr. Benson declared flatly that the
president had said what he knew to be
untrue when he asserted in his Cleve

prepare for defense at once and that
nobody knew what the next day might
bring forth.
The committee heard during the day
representatives of the American Peace
society, the anti-preparedness commit
tee, and other opponents of increased
military and naval expenditures. Then
Benson was called by the anti-preparedness
committee. He insisted that the
United States was in no danger of in
vasion; that the government knew "it
could accept war o"r reject" as it chose;
that talk of preparedness was inspired
by such men as General Leonard Wood,
and that the people of the country

General J. J. Pershing and his entire
staff left here late today for Colum
bus. N. M., General Pershing went on
a special train leaving his personal
baggage to be sent after him.
The departure of General Pershing
moans that the headquarters of the
main expeditionary force has been I
shifted from here to Columbus, where;
nearly 4.000 troops, representing the
three arms of the set vice, cavalry, ar- j
tillery and intantry, already nave
beer, concentrated. This force has
practically completed its equipment
accumulating of supplies and is ap
proaching campaign form.
Simultaneously with the departure
of General Pershing and his staff, it
was learned from a high military au
thority that Villa's raid on Columbus
wan not as barren of results to the
bandit chief as was supinised. He is
now known to have captured at least
92 cavalry horses, which he drove
before him safely across the border.
A ripple of excitement was felt in
El Paso today when militaty patrols
armed with rifles and bayonets ap
peared on the streets. Military pro
vosts without rifles have been about
the only sign of the unusual situation
on the streets here up to the present.
The patrols were ordered out to guard
the electric light, waler and gas
plants, but no explanation of this
move was forthcoming from Fort
Bliss.
Military men. Ixith American and
Mexican, had thought Villa was muk- i
ing for the great mountain chain of
tfco Sierra Madres. General Bertani,
heading of; Villi to the west, had
said he believed Villa was trying to
get into Sinaloa, which has enjoyed
comparative peace and is filled with
prosperous ranches. But apparently
finding his way blocked at Cassia
Grandes, the bandit gave up his an
nounced intention f massacreing the
Mormons and took the easiest way
out.
Although he is heading eastward.
Villa has by no means an easy pros
pect of escape from Carranza troops
about him or from the Americans on
th3 border. If he continues east in
an attempt to cut the line of the
Mexican control, he will not only
have to cross desert plains vokl of
water, fooi and loot, but will be in
danger of a clash w ith the cavalry of
General Garza, which is striking after
him northwestward from Laguna. The
Mexican Central railway, which he
would hav to cross, is some fifty
miles east of his present reported po
sition and affords a possible quick
route for Cirranza or American troops
to head him off.
Villa was reported today at Espin
doleno. east of Coiralitos, and later
?t Galeana, which lies on the course
of the Saita Maria river.
Gavira said he believed that Villa
is now headed for the mountains of
the Santa Ana district to the south of
Galeana. This !ong has been Villa's
headquarters and he is believed to
have good stores and munitions se
creted there. To reach this pl.tce.
Gavira said he would merely have to
follow up the bed of the Santa Ma
ria river, which he is said to have
reiched now.
The atmosphere of the Juarez head
quarters on the receipt of this nsws,
following the harmonious conference
with Brigadier General Pershing to
day and the announcement that Car
ranza's troops may cross the Ameri
can border, was more cheerful than
in several days. Gavira said of the
conference with General Pershing: I
"We discussed conditions frankly,'
exchanged points of view and are
satisfied."
Restored telegraph communication
with Casas Grandes removed a cause
of cnnsidei&ble uneasiness. An effort
will noft be made to repair the dam
age Villa did to the railway between
Casr.s Grandes and Juarez near Cor
raUtos station. The wireless station
in Ji arez keeps in touch with the
cities of both coasts, such as V?ra
Cruz and Tampico on the east and
M.izatlan from the west, as well as
with Mexico City.
Four Villa generals arrested here
last night on charges of vagrancy.

day, probably until after the Ameri

American was among the other pris
oners arrested because of suspected
sympathy with Villa and the police
said they would keep him along with

day, reporting that a dozen Mexicans
chased them last night on a road on
the border between here and Col im

is apparently concentrating his avail
able troops, drawing them in from
the border.
In addition to the troops, more
than ten trains of supplies have been
sent south, including food, ammuni
tion and forage, the large depot at
Agua Prieta being practically denuded.
It is also reported that the garrison
at El Tigie has been given orders to
march overland to Nacozari at an
hour's notice.
During the past week a total of
about 1,200 soldiers have been gath

this concentration of troops is not
known here.

SAN ANTONIO, March 13. That a
sufficient force is now gathered at the
Mexican border, under the command of
Brigadier General John J. Pershing, to
begin the pursuit of Francisco Villa,
was announced tonight by General
Frederick Funston.
The general said that only the com
pletion of plans for backing up the
expeditionary force was needed. He
was non-committal, however, as to
the time needed to accomplish this.
Earlier in the day General Funston
had announced that the action of Gen
eral Carranza in refusing to permit
American troops to enter Mexico un
less Mexican troops were allowed to
enter the United States in search of
bandits would have no effect on the
dispatch of the expedition.
General Funston declared reports
that American troops had been or
dered to cross the border in pursuit
of Villa were untrue. Reiter
ating previous statements, he said
it would be useless to send any
thing but a strong, well prepared force
into Mexico.
That the expeditionary force will
be a strong one was indicated by a
statement of the general that when
the expedition was fully organized,
there would be only six o; eight regi
ments other than these on the border,
left in the I'nited States. This did not
take into account troops in the canal
zone and the Philippines.
Outside of mentioning two or three
scattered movements, the general re
fused to give any definite idea of the
size of the expedition, by stating what

history was begun here today when
two American battleships, the New
York and the Arkansas, bombarded
armor-test fortifications at Fort Mor
gan. All day long the two super
dreadnaughts hurled big projectiles
from their main batteries into the for-
' tifications with high officials of the
war and navy departments looking on.
The results of the test, which ulti
mately are expected to have an im

Employee's of the mining compaies
of Nacozari, and nearby communi
ties are expected to arrive late to

the mining companies have decided
to close down their plants until after
Villa is eliminated. Scores of refu
gees were pouring in here all day
from other towns below the border,
filling hotels, rooming houses and
private dwellings to overflowing.
Tlie military authorities are taking
every precaution against a possible
outbreak on the part of Villa sym
pathizers. Strong patrols have been
sent to guard smelters and other
plants along the-border which might
possibly be the objects of an at
tack. Battery A of the Sixth field artill
ery is still in camp here but is ready
to move immediately. Additional troops
including the First cavalry enroute
from California, is expected to reach

EL PASO, Tex., March 13 March
13. Villa has taken a sudden twist to
the eastward accordingto a report re
ceived tonight by General Gavira at
Juarez. This new move apparently
takes Villa away from the territory
where it had been supposed he would
seek refuge and north of which the
American troops concentration has
I been heaviest.
This information was received by
Gavira from his subordinate, Colonel
Gonzales, who commands the troops
protecting the Mormon colony at Casas
Grandes.
The wires from Juarez to the colony
were cut last night by Villa's men,
Gonzales restored them this evening.
Villa, Gonzales reports is at Galeana,
a town about twenty miles due east of
Coiralitos, where he was last previous

Calles Mobilizes Forces
DOUGLAS, Ariz., March 13. It was
definitely reported tonight that General
Calles has mobilized about 5,000 Car
ranza troops at Cabullona, IS miles
south of the Arizona border. Carranza
officials declared there were probably
8,000 men at Cabullona. This force has
fifteen pieces of artillery. General
Calles has been gathering these troops
for several days, having announced
they will join in the pursuit of Villa.
For several clays General Calles has
been massing troops northward from
Hermosillo, to the border near Naco.
From there they were marched across
country to Agua Prieta and then sent
south to Cabullona. On account of
the critical situation along the bor

troop movements have gone ahead
without regard to the diplomatic ex
changes. Mr. Lansing also made public a
statement issued in the name of Pres
ident Wilson reiterating that every

nance of the army; General William L.

the operations today. Merchant craft
had been warned out of the danger
zone and the Mobile quarantine sta
tion was abandoned during the firing.
It was explained at Fort Morgan that i

ried out through co-operation of the
war and navy departments, with a view
for target practice as well as for armor
testing. It was understood the firing

General Pershing, it is understood, is
to assume immediate command of the

the punitive expedition against Villa
into Mexico. Commands now at Col

men.
Several other commands are ex

tionary force, with field wireless and
aeroplane equipment.
Organizations now here are eight
troops of the Thirteenth cavalry, with
he First squadron enroute from
Marfi, Texas, and other border points
east; the Sixth and Sixteenth regi
ments ol infantry, three companies of
the first battalion of the Twentieth
Infantry; Batteries A. B and C. com

bulance. It was reported tonight that in ac
cordance with orders the First. Ninth,
Tenth and Eleventh regiments of tbS
cavalry and two squadrons of the
Twelfth would be dispatched here at
once. Another report states that three
aeroplanes were enroute here from
San Diego, Cal.
General Pablo Bertani, commanding:
the garrison of 2,000 Carranza troops
at Palomas, six miles south of tha
border, today notified American mili
tary authorities that he expected to
call on General Pershing for a con
ference. Approximately 12.000 troops, with
4S mountain and field gun batteries,
were on the border tonight between
Dougias, Ariz., and El Paso,, a line
about 200 miles long. A little more
than one-third of this force was cav
alry. From a camp of a few hundred men,
Columbus over night and todav grew
to a military establishment of nearly
3,300, with indications that about 4.00(1
men .-.re to be concentrated here im
mediately. Further evidence that this
point may be the .starting place of the
largest column in immediate pursuit
of ilia appeared in the erection of
headquarters for Brigadier General
John J. Pershing, who Major General
Funston announced today, would be
the leader of the expeditionary force.
Officers here talked of a march

reports that while the Columbus col
umn is striking south, another move
ment will be made from the vicinity
of El Paso and a third from the Ari-

tion to preclude the possibility of
armed intervention in Mexico.
Reports from the border laid be
fore President Wilson by Secretary
Baker during an hours conference
tonight indicated that such progress
had been made in the mobilization of
American troops that first force
against Villa was ready to move into
Mexico at any time.
j President Wilson was said tonight to
I resent deeply persistent reports that
j the United States expects trouble
from General Carranza. Some ad
ministration officials expressed the
view that a certain element in tho
United States was purposely mis
representing the facts in order to
bring about war with Mexico.
The president, it is understood, be
lieves that General Carranza has
shown a commendable destre to co-'
operate with the United States and
that the only real danger of serious
trouble over the pursuit of Villa by
American troops lies in published'
reports telling of plans of the Amer
ican government for "war."
If the issue becomes clear cut that
both President Wilson and General
Carranza want Villa, the murderer and
bandit, eliminated, for the assurance
of peace and security, administra
tion officials do not believe there
will be serious danger of widespread
resistance.
There was serious discussion in ad
ministration circles today of making
an effort to stop the publication o;
alarmist reports. The president dis
cussed the situation during the day
with Senators Stone and Saulsbury,
members of the foreign relations;
committee.
