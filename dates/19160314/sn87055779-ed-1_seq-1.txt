Neither law nvr parents are goin?
to destroy the romance of Freida
Werner, 6.14 Dubail av. a pretty 17-year-old
girl who eloped to SX Jo
seph, Mich., Monday afternoon with
Claude Anderson, 19 years old, who
lives on Ii. H. No. C, out of South
Bend. The youn;? couple were
stopped in St. Joseph before they
could secure their license and
brought back to .South Ilend, the
parents of the girl charging young
Anderson with kidnaping.
In city court Tuesday morning.
Judge Warner decided that he was
unable to solve the case because
Freida absolutely refused to go
home with her mother, who was on
the Hcene. Therefore he postponed
It for tvo weeks, leaving the matter
to be settled between Frieda, Claudo
and their respective parentF.
Because of the girl's age it would
be illegal for her to marry Ander
son. This was pointed out to her by
Pros. Chester Montqomery. Donald
Drummond, attorney for Anderson,
assisted in trying to reach some ort
of an agreement whereby the girl
would go homo to her parents. But
the wrangle continued to progress,
Mrs. Werner being the leader of una
side and Mrs. Anderson, mother of
Claude, leading the opposite forces.
Pros. Montgomery, after trying for
an hour to settle the affair, threw up
his hands and told the girl she
should go home but could do as she
pleased. She started from the court
room with Claude. Her mother
grabbed her by the arm and de
clared that she must go home with
her. The girl ran screaming from
her mother, throwing her arms
around her sweetheart's neck
and begging that he keep her from
her mother. Attempts of the mother
to take the girl by force wer
thwarted by young Anderson and
other relatives who were on the
scene.
Then the two mothers became in
volved in an argument relative to
the merits of their respective fam
ilies. "I don't want my girl in your fam
ily," asserted the mother.

brother. Mrs. Werner went after her.
But the girl eluded her and ran
from the court room out through
the police station to the street where
her sweetheart was waiting. Throw
ing her arms around him she again
pleaded that she be taken from her
mother and father. The parents
pursued but were not nimble enough
to catch the young lovers, who tied
down the street in company with
Anderson's sister and brother.
Atty. Drummond had told them to
get their dinner and come to his
office during the afternoon. He will
attempt to Hnd some means by
whicli the couple can be married.
According to the story that was
brought out, young Anderson has
been keeping company with Freida
for a year or more, and Monday
they decided to be married. Ac
cording to the boy's mother, he has
a good job, money in the bank and
is buying a little home. She contend
ed that as the "children" as she call
ed them, had decided, there was
nothing that could .stop them in the
long run.
"She's not going to marry him,"
declared Freida's mother.
"I will or die," sobbed Freida.
Young Anderson was at times
anxious to get into the fracas physi
cally, when Mr. Werner attempted
to interfere, but was persuaded to
keep quiet.
The young couple asserted 4hat
they could not be separated by any
one and the proposition of the girl,
who is working, securing rooms
apart from her family until next No
vember when she will be 18, was dis
cussed. Indications Tuesday, were that
whatever steps may be taken by the
parents of the girl, the little god of
love will not be frustrated.

formally.

"I am pleased to see you at my

The general speaks English with

There were many things he could
do. For instance he could tell ot
what orders he had received, he
could outline his plan of campaign

"Hut I cannot speak of those
things," smiled the general.
"Are vour soldiers to march withj

"Regarding that I have not re

"Come I will show you."
Gaviera strode rapidly to the
folding doors. On one of the doors
was pinned a colored map. about
half the size of a newspaper sheet.
Into it were stuck pins, seven or
eight white ones, few were gold

Wilson's Acceptance of
Carranzas Proposa I
Has Cleared Situation
laternatiofi ll News Service:
WASH I NOT UN. March 14
Wilson's acceptance of the Carranza
reciprocal agreement in Mexican
border arrangements, has had a
most beneficial effect. This was ad
mitted by Acting Sec'y of State Polk
today, the ugh he made it clear that
so far hi? had received no direct
word from Oarranza. However, con
sular agtnts throughout northern
Mexico report that conditions show
material Improvement and there was
a peneral air of confidence about the
i state department that the situation
was g-ettira; better.
Meanwhile the war department
professed to be without any olncial
information concerning the events
on the border. It was stated by
Sec'y Haker that he had not yet been
officially notified that Gen. Persh
ing, who Is to be the actual field
commander of the expedition "to set
Villa" had left El Paso for Columbus,
X, M.. despite the general insistence
of army officers that Pershing was
"on the job." Inasmuch as it has
been accepted that the punitive ex
pedition will he given at least 2 4
hours lead on all its movements it
was not expected that any announce
ment would he permitted u 'l the

Upon leaving the white house
Counsellor Polk said that he simply

president. 'lie declined to state the
exact subject under consideration. In
answer to a question he said that the
state department has receiv ed . word
from northern Mexico that Sec'y
Lansing's reply to Oarranza was re
ceived favorably there.
A quiet tip has been passed to
the war department officials that the
effort to get Villa may turn into a
race between American and Carran
za troops. Carranzista forces are
reported to be massing at a number
of points prepared to cut off Villa
