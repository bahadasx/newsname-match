i El Paso, Tex., March 14. Brlga-
dier-General John J. Pershing, com-
manding the American expeditionary
a force into Mexico, left here on a west-
j bound train last night and since his
j depaiture military authorities have
t refused all information about him.
!v General Pershing's train was said
5 here to be going to Columbus, N. M.,
Jf where today some 4000 men of the
n first expeditionary force are In readi-
ii ness for the dash after Villa. Some
v hours after General Pershing left
jj here, however, it became evident that
' military authorities in this section in
tended that no information should
fA leak out about his further movements.
? In expectation of the general's de-
rarturo last night from El Paso, a
.1 crowd of photographers and moving
i picture men had gathered at a railway
Btation platform. Piles of military
j equipments and bulky army wagons
j were scattered about the train. Gen-
jj eral Pershing, instead of walking
) down the lane which the photograph-
,. ers had formed, stepped behind an
J army wagon and thence to the oppo-
1 site aide of the car. The train was
' about, to pull- out when the farewell
( crowd discovered that the general had
3 oulinaneuvered them.
All News Stopped.
Soon ater General Pershing's de
parture last night, the mass of detail
ed Information which had been pour
ing In for several days from numerous
A border points wast of here about 'de
; tails of troop movements was com
pletely stopped. This was in line with
the policy forecasted by military au
thorities to keep secret any important
troop movements.
No information reached here as to
how soon movements in force might
be expected. General Funston's an
nouncement last night that the expedl
' tlon was awaiting only the placing of
1 adequate border patrols did not serve
to clear up the question of when the
; troops will enter, for although con-
i i siderable Information has been obtaln-
,fe ed about the gathering of units for the
2fc expeditionary column, the military au-
f thorlties have effectively' cloaked in
!' secrecy their preparations for main
s' tenance of a secondary line for patrol
i duly along the American border. The
shut down on information from the
border territory where the first large
force had gathered was taken here to
mean simply that the military authorl
'3 ties have completed their arrange-
; ment to try to keep Villa In the dark
as to what pursuit he may expect.
Large Force Available.
It Is known, however, that the
troops now available along the New
Mexico-Arizona border are equal In
numbers and equipment to any of the
I strongest forces which the United
j States has gathered in recent years.
As to their disposition either tor pur
suit of Villa or for "border policing
nothing Is known definitely here ex

Outlaw Chief Heading South
From Galaena and Carrying
Large Numbers of Wound-
ed in Wagons.
El Paso, Tex., March 14. Villa,
beading south from Galaena, is now
encircled by Carranza troops, accord
ing to advices from General Luis
Gultorrez, commander-in-chief of Chl
buahua, today. With 15,000 men in
Chihuahua and heavy reinforcements
on their' way from the division of
General Calles in Sonora, he thinks
Villa has small chance of escape.
General Gutierrez arrived in Juarez
early In the day and later met Gen
eral Gaviera, the local commandant,
and Consul Garcia of El Paso in a
private conference. Afterward Gen
eral Gutierrez gave out a statement
that besides the troops holding points
and maintaining patrols five columns
of 1200 men each are closing up on
the bandit chief under the respective
commands of Gutierrez himself and
Generals Luis Herrera, Rafael Mai
dondo, Benjamin Garza and Jose Ga
bazos. Villa is now moving south of Ga
laena General Garza sent a new cav
alry detachment after him last night
from Ahumeda on- the east, in addi
tion to the force sent yesterday from
Lacuna to the south of Ahumeda.
While the cavalry forces are mov
ing from the east the command of 900
men at Santa Anna under Colonel
Anazos is believed at the Juarez head
quarters to be sufficient to check any
attempt by Villa to escape to the
south up the canyon of the Santa
Maria river.
A dispatch received today from
Colonel Nleto Macla at Pearson stated
that Villa carried a large number of
wounded with him In wagons through
Galaena. The Mormons at Casas

Washington, March 14 Unofficial
advices received here today Indicate
that 'Germany will make complete
amends to the United States If It Is
found that a German submarine tor
pedoed the Norwegian bark Silius,
from which seven Americans were
rescued in Havre roads.
The German government is repre
sented here as believing that a tor
pedo was not responsible for the loss
of the bark and that any commander
who attacks a neutral ship such as
the Silius without warning would be
exceeding his Instructions.
Much Concern Felt.
Tho sinking of the Silius has been
the cause of much concern here be
cause American Consul Osborne at
Havre reported that the ship was tor
pedoed without warning. His report
was based on statements of American
survivors. Officials are Inclined to
entertain the possibility that the ship
might have been struck by a mine,
but the case is being investigated
further.
Today the state department receiv
ed another report from Consul Os
borne which made no mention of tho
cause of the sinking, merely saying
that the vessel was unarmed-, carried
a cargo of grain and no passengers.
Of tho crow of seventeen members

AMERICAN BAR
ENTERS PROTEST
Former President Taft and Six
Others Consider Brandeis
Unfit for Supreme
Bench.
Washington, March 14. Former
President Taft and six other former
presidents of the American Bar Asso
ciation today protested to the senate
Judiciary sub-committee against con
firmation of the nomination of Louis
D. Brandeis as supremo court Justice
who has been nominated by President
Wilson.
The others, were Simon E. Baldwin,
Francis Rawle. Joseph P.'Choate, Eli
hu RooL Moorfleld Story and Peter
W. Meldrim.
The first six sent a letter stating
that "taking into view the reputation,
character and professional career of
Louis D. Brandeis ho Is not a fit per
son to bo a member of the supreme
court of the United States."
Mr. Meldrim wrote from Savannah,
Ga.:
"My reason for refusing to approve
waa that the reputation of Mr. Bran
deis at his home bar makes him an
unfit person to bo appointed."
Both letters wero read to the com
mittee today by August G. Fox, at-
torney for the opposition to the con
firmation at the re-opening -of public
hearings.
William F. Fitzgerald, a Boston
broker, testified aa to tho Brandeis
connection with the Old Dominion
Copper company case. In 1903 he said
Brandeis was employed by Towle and
Fitzgerald to help got proxies to gain
control of the company. They vere
successful and after electing new di
rectors it was found necessary to raise
more funds. Finally, Fitzgerald testi
fied, it was planned to consolidate
with the United Globe Mining com
pany, adjoining and to give the Old
Dominion stockholders, 3ome of whom ,
Fitzgerald represented, a two to one
interest.
An engineer employed by the Old
Dominion directors to examine the
properties, recommended, however,
Fitzgerald testified, that the Old Do
minion stockholders should receive a
four to ono interest. Fitzgerald said
Brandeis countenanced the directors
In canceling this report from the
stockholders and the public 'for two
or three weeks. Fitzgerald added that
when he protested to Brandeis tho lat
ter responded that he had better go in
with the merger, or get on the band
wagon.
Edward F. McCIennen, Brandeis
law partner, testified that ho was not
familiar with the plan for financing
tho Old Dominion company, but could
not conceive of any immorality in the
affair.

Saturday.
BERLIN RATES FALL
Exchange on Germany Drops
to Lowest Record Deprecia
tion of Over 23 Per Cent.
New York, March 14. War stocks
and kindred Issues boomed on the
stock exchange today, trading being
reminiscent of last summer's strong
rnd active market. Sales up to 1
o'clock approximated 750,000 shares,
pointing to a full day of over 1,000,
000 shares.
Gains of 2 to almost 5 points were
registered by such issues as Crucible
Steel, American locomotive, Ameri
can Car, Railway Steel Springs, Unit
ed States Cast Iron Pipe and Stude
buker, while Bethlehem Steel led all
others with a gain of 25 points to 550,
miking a Jump of over GO points from
last Saturday's quotation.
As the session progressed there
came a demand for standard railway
stocks, Reading leading that division
with an advance of 3 34 points to
87 7-8c, its record price on the ex
chanjge since it began to be quoted in
dollars. Canadian Pacific, Union Pa
cific, Lehigh Valley, grangers and
eastern trunk lines were higher by 1
to 2 points. Various specialties such
as petroleums, sugars, marines and
motors participated appreciably, with
marked revival of public interest
which had long been dormant.
United States Steel was the actual
leader In point of activity, sales up
to 1 o'clock aggregating 110,000 shares
or over 15 per cent of the whole.
Steel's maximum advance up to that
tlmo represented an over night gain
of 1 3-8c.
While stocks wore mounting to
higher prices, exchange on Germany
was fnlllng to lowest records. Taking
four marks as the unit of exchange,
remittances to Berlin fell to 71 7-8,
wh'lch implied a depreciation of over
23 per cent from the normal parity.
