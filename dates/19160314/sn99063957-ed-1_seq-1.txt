Badgered by Slaughter's At
torneys Girl JHrectly Ac
causes Minister
Oroville, Cal., Mar. 14. Trembling
and apparently on the verge of a break
down, Gertrude l.amson, 15 years old.
began her fourth session on the witness
stand today in Kev. Madison Slaugh
ter's trial on charge or attacking her.
Led by interrogations of the'district at
torney, the girl described wtyit the
prosecution claims Bur attempts on
the part of defense supporters to make
her retract her allegations against the
pastor.
She asserted defense attorneys visit
ed her frequently, urging her to say
the charges were fulse. As a result of
their visits the prosecution says she
wrote two letter declaring all the ac
cusations were untrue. On the witness
stand the girl said she wrote these
notes under the impression that by so
ihiing she would save her mother's life.
She had been told ner mother would
die if the letters were hot written. The
missives, admitted Gertrude, were dic
tated to her.
While, she testified, Slaughter viewed
her steadfastly and listened eagerly to
every syllable. At times he gripped
the arms of his chair and glanced at
the clock.
Defense lawyers took voluminous
notes, preparatory to an attempt to im
peach the girl's testimony.
One of the most dramatic moments
of the trial was when Gertrude, bad
gered for hours by a enr.-s-exaaiina-tion
of sharp questions from defense
lawyers, looked wearily toward Slaugh
ter and made a direct accusation
against him. The defense had been en
deavoring to show Her in some way
culpable. Turning toward the pastor
she said in a low voice:
"Look what that man has done. lie
is the guilty one, nnd not myself."
The words produced a 'small sensa
tion. Slaughter took tight hold on the
arms of his chair, but maintained his
composure. His daughters looked un
concerned, Eev. Madison Slaughter, accused of
attacking Gertrude Lamson, aged 15
controlled her parents so hey refuse)
to believe her story, according to th
girl's testimony in Slaughter's trial to
day. She declared her father at first be
lieved all she said, but later was won
over to the other side and refused to
credit her assertions. In this connec
tion Gertrude cried with considcrabi,
dramatic, emphasis.
"I told him he must believe me, be
cause what I told him was the truth."
Defense Counsel Kennedy instantly
complained that the girl was indulg
ing in irregular dramatic poses under
the direction of the prosecution. Assist
ant District Attorney Davids hotly de
nied it. but Judge Gregory ruled out
her last statement.
Telling of a mock trial staged at her
home by defense attorneys so they
could practice, Gertrude Lamson. 15
years old, continued testifying this af
ternoon in the trial of Kev. Madison
Slaughter on a charge of attacking
her.
She said her mother suggested every
thing that went into her letter in
whicji she denied all her accusations
against the pastor.
On the stand today the girl could not
define the words used in the affidavit
which she signed, saying the charges
were false.
She claimed her parents made efforts
to frighten her by the power of Guy H.
Kennedy, Slaughter's attorney.
They were said to nave told her he
was a "terrible man" who could get
anybody out of trouble or nut anybody
he wanted to into the reform school.
Her mother; the girl said, told her
she could never convict Slaughter, as
he had an alibi for every day of tin
six alleged acts.
During the court recess Gertrude met
her in an ante-room and attempted to
embrace her, but Mrs. Lunisin pushed
her away. Gertrude wept.
Carranza Already

Kl Paso, Texas, Mar. II. It was re
ported this afternoon the Carranza ttov
ernnient asked the I'aited States

The delav is believed to have been

GERMAN ATTACK
REPULSED WITH
TERR!
Charge Through Forest Halted
and Ranks Shattered by
Artillery Fire
GRAND ASSAULT HAS NOT
YET STARTED AT VERDUN
Great Bodies of German
Troops Are On March
Destination Unknown
By Charles P. Stewart.
(I'nited Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, Mar. 14. Breaking the long
lull in infantry fighting before Ver
dun, Germans today ch lrged into
Haudremont forest only to have their
ranks shattered by artillery fire whica
coveted every foot of ground with
mathematical precision, according to
Paris accounts.
The Germans did not attempt to ld
vance with large forces, and those who
survived the hail of French shells were
forced to flee.
In the Lepetre forest Taris said the
Germans attempted to regain lost
ground. Again the French artillery
blasted scores into eternity and hurled
nick the charging Teutons in defeat.
There was a steadv artillery bom
bardment around Vaux, but the expect
ed grand assault against Verdun hail
not begun, latest dispatches s lid.
Berlin remained silent regarding all
operations around Verdun. The only im
portant infantry work mentioned by
the Germans was a repulse of British
near Wieltje, in the Vprcs district.
Clear weather brought out the avi
ators, and bottles iiigh aloft were
frequent. Berlin announced three Brit
ish and two French machines had been
brought down.
Artillery Duel Continues.
London, Mar. 14. German reinforce
ments arrived near Verdun today while
the kaiser's great guns continued the
smashing at the French trenches.
Delayed Swiss dispatches said the
Swiss-German frontier had been closcil,
to insure secrecy of troop movements.
French aviators hovering over the Teu
ton -lines observed greit bodies of Ger
man reinforcements on the march.
Swiss sources nlso revived the re
port that Field Marshal Von Mackon
sen is commanding the German attack
on Verdun and that Kaiser Wilhelm has
summoned Field Marshal Von Jlinden
burg there to assist.
Critics believe that in his new thrust
the crown prince will drive simultane
ously at Goose Hill and Dead Man's
Hill, striking also at Foist De Vaux
and Do Tavanues. Artillery fire is di
rected most severely against those hills.
It is thought now the Germans will re
sume heir offensive with an attempt to
fight through Corbeaux and Cumieres
woods, to offset their losses in assault
ing Goose and Dead Man's hills.
The Paris correspondent of the Lon
don Mail declared the lull in infantry
work noticeable for the past few days
has been duo to a need for nri'JIerv
preparation, and partly to a redistribu
tion of German forces.
"The Seventh and Twenty-Second di
visions which bore the brunt of the
fighting at Bethincourt and at Goose
Hill, have been severely handled nil
need rest," wrote the correspondent.
"Possibly, like the Klevent'n reserve
division, they must be entirely replaced
by new men."

Colonel Herbert J. Slocuni, who
"licked" Villa when the bandit chief
raided Columbus, was appointed to com

the larger part of the armed forces en

.To investigate reports of Venustiano
Carranza 's soldiers mobilization at
Palomas in the direct line of the con

arranged for a conference with the con

two will meet on American soil today.

Gutierrez intimated that to offset

"In addition to our five columns,"
he. declared, "we have ordered between

Gutierrez will leave Juarez within n
day or two and take charge of the cam

forecast a further attempt by de facto

are reported surrounding Villa is in

Kl i'aso, Texas, March 14. Fears for
500 American Mormon colonists in
Chihuahua were renewed this afternoon
when a Villa deserter arriving at Casus
Granites reported the banjit chief was
marching against the settlenfent de
termined to exterminate the colony.
Information to this effect reached
Carranzista officials at Juarez, over the
restored telegraph lines.
Despite earlier constitutionalist
claims of Villa being surorunded by
Carranzistas, he was said to have ar
rived at Casus Graades nnd to have de
manded surrender of the Carranza gar
rison there as well us of the American
colonists.
Villa has burned every bridge of the
Mexican Northwestern railway between
Corralitos and Sabinal, making it im
possible for the train awaiting the
Mormons at Pearson to travel toward
the border.
According to the deserter's story,
Villa became enraged over stories that
the Mormons were to act as guides and
scouts for t ho American expeditionary
force.
The loss of half of his COO men at
Columbus by the fighting around the
town and by 'subsequent desertions
further angered him, and he swore to
kill all Americans, men, women and

(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Mar. 14. With Ameri
can troops on the eve of entering Mex
ico President Wilson today was threat
ened with congressional revolt against'
his Mcxciun policy.
An outburst of criticism was be
lieved imminent in the senate, where
tho "military reciprocity" agreement
with Carranza is disliked by a numher.
Many senators hnvo already expressed
indignation because Carranza was giv
en permission to enter the I'nitml
States. An explosion was also tlireuteu
cned in the house
On the other hand, the Whito House
was indignant at the Mexican "war
talk."
It let it be known that ".jingo dis
cussions" were the most embarrassing
and dangerous features of the situation.
Tho administration considered drastic
measures to halt the war and inter
vention agitation both in and out of
congress. Administration member? dis
cussed an investigation of intervention
propaganda, possibly by Attorney Gen
eral Gregory. 1
Tho principal protest in congress
was based on thu fact that President
Wilson failed to consult the legislative
bodies before accepting (tnrranrn's
"reciprocity" proposition. Coosiileriug
that many CurranziKtas are semi-organized
bandits, and that many o'f them
are former Villistas, opponents of the
schemo fear the agreement will result
in forays on American soil by outlaws
masquerading as soldiers of Carranza.
Senators Disagree.
With the state department udmittiuj;
that no "military reciprocity" treaty
or written uuthority exists, opponents
declared President Wilson had exceeded
his constitutional powers in agreeing tu
tho technicul "invasion" of America.
Jealous of the presidential perogutives,
some insisted the nR.,.ument would bo
void unless ratified by the senate.
Administration supporters charged
opponents of the pact were actuated
by political motives, and promised to.
severely criticise any attempt to mako
political capital of the incident.
Some fear Wilson's course will ulti
mately mean intervention, if not hostil
ities with Carranza and a united Mex
ico, while others believed congress
should not hesitate to legalize the presi
dent's procedure.
Delay in starting the expedition also,
threatened to provoke criticism, aimed
chiefly at the army, its transportation,
facilities, nnd its lack of ammunition.
Administration officials insisted di
plomacy had not impeded the work of
mobilization.
Final orders for the Villa hunt arj
in General Funston ' hands. The wires
hummed today with messages rouveytn
details of the expedition, while Wash
ington awaited news that tho Amer
icans had entered Mexico.
Army men believed General Persh
ing's main column would not start be
fore tomorrow at the earliest.
All reports agreed that tho "mili
tary reciorocitv" imreenient had a
quieting effect upon Mexican popular
sentiment.
John Bull always was a poor corres
pondent, except when he had Bonao de
maads of his own to make. , ,,
