Nebraska Senator Says He Expects
Name Will Go Through With-
out Hitch.
SHALLENBERGER SAYS NOTHING
I
Joseph W. Woodrough of Omaha
was yesterday nominated to the
Judgeship of the United States dis
trict court, of Nebraska by President
Wilson.
Telegraphic dispatches from
Washington Indicate that the nomi
nation, which went to the senate,
will be followed by confirmation in
due season, according to Senator
Hitchcock.
The. senator is further quoted as
follows:
"I told the attorney" general some
time ago, I would give hearty sup
port to any person he would recom
mend to the president. The selec
tion of Mr. Woodrough is excellent,
and I believe will be acceptable to
the bar of the state.
Predict Smooth nallina-.
"Had any man other than an
Omahan been selected I rather think
be would have made Omaha his
home as Judge Munger did, but Mr.
Woodrough has lived in Omaha for
years and will naturally go on as he
has been doing, with this difference;
He will go on a great bench with a
number of illustrious predecessors to
Incite him to his best attainments."
Representative Lobeck thought
the nomination splendid. "Mr,
Woodrough comes from our part of
the state and we will like his selec
tion on that account. He will make
a good Judge. We can hardly ask
for more than faithfulness In the
public service."
Ex-Governor Shallenberger, who
had hoped that his district might
have been honored with the Monger
succession and that Judge Thompson
might have pulled down the plum.
had nothing to say when asked aa
to the -Woodrough appointment.

UNION PACIFIC TO
BUILD AJEW LINE
Lets Contract to Connect Main Line
with Western Terminus of Mof
fat Line in Colorado.
TO CONSTRUCT A MILE A DAY
To Kilpatrlck Bros. & Collins of
Beatrice the Union Pacific has
awarded the contract for the grading
of a branch line from Wamsutter,
"Vyo., to Craig, Colo., a distance of
eighty-eight miles. Equipment will
be assembled and work will begin as
soon as the ground thaws. It is ex
pected that the grade will be ready
for the steel within 100 days after
work begins.
Wamsutter is on ' the Union Pa
cific's main line, 731 miles west of
Omaha and forty-one miles west of
Rawlins. It is pretty well up on the
dirlde, having an elevation of 6,702
to. ' It Is now one of the principal
coaling and water taking stations on
the mala line, though It hju a popu-J
Iatlon of only about 100, the people
living there being about all con
nected with the Union Pacific.
Prom Wamsutter the new Una will run
almost directly south, striking the moun
tain about twenty-five miles south, from
the' town and following a canon all the
way to Craty, giving the road a 1 per
cent grade over practically the entire
distance. ' v
Enroute between the two' points - there
ia a considerable area of rich agricultural
land that will be ' under cultivation aa
soon as some scheme Tor Irrigation Is
worked out. The line will pass throngn
a considerable extent of heavy pine tim
ber and In the vicinity of Craig will tap
Immense coal fields. The coal found In
thki vicinity la a sort of a semi-anthracite,
said to be superior to that obtained from
Arkansas.
Craig is now the wtstern terminus of
the Moffat Una built west from Denver
some years ago.

Jefferis is Outspoken for
John L. Kennedy for Senator
It is definite that A. W. Jef
feris is not to be a candidate for United
Stales senator before the primaries in

republican nomination. When asked yes
terday concerning this matter, Mr. Jef
feris sand:
"It istrue that a great many friends
out in the state and In Omaha have fre
quently requested meto file for the senate
and I am not unmindful of the compli
ment that they have paid me by such
action on their part, but I have iiever
felt that I could spare the time necessary
to make a satlufactory campaign for this

would be impossible for me to cast aside,

to 'obtain this hiu-h office I "have felt

COLUMBUS, March 13. Approxi
mately 12,000 troops with forty
eight mountain and field gun bat
teries were on the border tonight be
tween Douglas, Ariz., and El Paso,
Tex., a line about 200 miles long. A
little more than one-third of this
force was cavalry.
' From a camp of a few hundred
men, Columbus, overnight and today

Talk of Straight March.
Officers here talked of a march
straight southward in pursuit of VH'a.
Troop movements seemed to bear out
reports that while the Columbus column
is striking south, another movement will
be made from the vicinity of Kl Paaj
and a third from the Arlsona line some
where near Douglas. Both the El Paso
and Douglas movements would be able
to follow rail lines, while the central
column from here would have to go over
land across a desert.
Belief here tonight was that tha Colum
bus column would be ready to start by
Thursday or, Friday. Intellgenee depart
ment officers secured maps and topo
graphy charts of the mountlaioua Chlhua-
hua-8onora border Into which It seems
possible f of Villa to enter with his
present start.
'Villa's position today, according to re
ports received by General Pablo Bertanl,
in command of 3,(00 Carrania soldiers just
across tha Mexican border from here,
was ' still near Corralltos, where he
stopped more than two days ago.

In the town of Columbus, the conduot
of Mexicans who were strangers was
closely watched. This work was ren
dered delicate by the large numbers of
Mexicans who are American citisens by
birth and among whom the Mexican new
comers were difficult to distinguish. One
prosperous American ranchman of Her

was taken into custody before his Iden

Oeneral John J. Pershing will command
tha expeditionary forces from this point
into Mexico in person. Lieutenant Colonel
D. C. Cabell of the Tenth cavalry, who. It
was expected, will be assigned to duty as
adjutant general of the force, arrived to

way In the new administration. Her In
terests are Important and . demand
thoughtful and statesman-like attention.
In order to secure tha election of a re
publican to the United States senate from
Nebraska it is Incumbent upon the re
publicans to nominate a strong man who
has the ability to fill the office and who
enjoys the confidence of the people. '
"The nominee ahould be an Omaha
man, for I think it will be conceded that
our gveat city should be the residence of
at least one of our United States sen
ators. Omaha often seeks communication
with the executive offices at Washington
and It Is imperative that it should have
some man upon whom It can rely to
produce results. Therefore, I am for the
nomination of John L. Kennedy. I know
him well and he is In every way fitted
for this position. He served a term In
the house of representatives and has
knowledge of legislative methods and of
department routine. la a republican,
who believes In republicanism and who
would represent our state ' with great
credit and ability. I predict bis nomina

WASHINGTON, Marc.i 13. The
I'nltcd States government entered
Irto p. formal agreement with the de
f..cto government of Mexico today
tmdrr which American troops will
crons the border to hunt down Villa
nnd his bandits with the expectation
of hearty co-operation from the Car
ransa .forces.'
Secretary Lansing made public the
tfxt of a note, accepting General
Carranza'ti proposal for a reciprocal
nirangemcnt between the two gov
ernments and announcing that the
United States held this arrange
ment to be now in force and '
binding upon both parties. General
Funston mill carry out his task
under this agreement. Official an
nouncement waa awaited tonight
that the American force had crossed
the border. Plans for the troop
n-oyeraents have gone ahead with
out regard to the diplomatic ex
changes.
Statement by Leasta.
Mr. Lnting also made nubllo a state
ment Issued in the name of President
Wilson reiterating that every steo heln
taken by the administration was baaed on
the deliberate Intention to preclude the
porslblllty of . armed Intervention In
Mexico. The statement follows:
"In order to remove any misapprehen
sion that may exist either in the United
Ktates or In Mexico, the president has
aithorlfed me to give In Ms name the
public assurance that military operations
now in contemplation by this government
will be scrupulously confined to tha ob
ject already announced, and that under
no circumstances win they be suffered to
Infringe in any degree upon tha sover
eignty, of Mexico or develop Into inter
vention of any kind In the Internal af
fairs of our sister republic On the cen
try. what is how being done Is deliber
ately, Intended ta preclude the possibility
of Intervention.",.,
' ' , ' What .-Sato Provides,
j The note to Carransaijerines the term
Of the agreement beyond the possibility
of misconstruction. In brief Jt provides
that where conditions arise on tha Aim i.
can side of the border similar to those
st Columbus which led to the orders to
Oeneral Funston to enter Mexico, the.
samo privilege will be accorded to the
Mexican da facto government without tha
necessity of a further exchange of views..
It Is clearly stated, however, that the
bandits to be pursued on American soil
by Mexican troops, must have come from
the American side, committed depreda
tions on the Mexican side and fled back
again to United States territory. .There
la no such instance oa record In recent
years.' . ,
Officials 'at the Mexican embassy here
were 'Jubilant over the acoeptano ef
Oeneral Carransa 'a proposal by the
United States. The ambassador-designate,
Ellaeo Arredondo. withheld omment
pending advice from bis chief, but other
officials made no secret of their entire
saUsfactlon with the American note,
, Beat tm Carransa.
It was transmitted promptly to General
Carransa. Some officials said that whllo
a few extreme radicals among Carransa,
adherents might show opposition to the
agreement, tbls element would not be
important nor would It Influence the
relations between the two governments.
Advices to the Navy department today
from Vera Crux, Tamplco and other
points on tha Mexican gulf coast tended
to confirm this view. Commanders of
American warships at these Boris said
i the publication there of the Intention of
tne united mates to send armed forces
after Villa had caused no excitement or
uneasiness. There were no indications of
anti-American demonstrations, the mes
sages said, when it appeared doubtful
what course the Carransa governranet
woid pursue.
To prevent any war munitions front
reaching Villa from the United Btates.
the Treasury department todav lnllniM4
its collectors at San Francisco, Nogales
and Loa Angeles to place an embargo on
shipment of arms and ammunitions
through those points Into Mesina. Tha
embargo affects the principal commer
cial gateways Into Chihuahua, Sonora and

ficient In extent to make certain that
Villa will not be supplied from this
