Sank Norwegian Bark.

Attacks On Liners.
Washington, March 14 Un
official advices received here
' today indicate that Germany
will make complete amends to
the United States if it is found
. that a German submarine tor
pedoed the Norwegian bark'
Silius, from which seven Amer
icans were rescued, in Havre
Roads. (
( The German government is repre
sented here as believing that a tor
pedo was not responsible for the loss
of the bark, holding that any com
mander who attacks a neutral ship
such as the Silius without warning
" would be exceeding his instructions.
The sinking of the Silius has been
the cause of much concern here be
cause American Consul Osborne at
Havre reported that the ship was tor
pedoed without warning. His report
was based on statements of American
survivors officials are inclined to en
tertain, the possibility that the ship
might have been struck by a mine,
but the case is being investigated
further. Today the statement re
ceived .another report from Consul
Osborne which made no mention of
the cause of the sinking, merely say
ing the vessel was unarmed, carried a
cargo of grain and no passengers. Of
the crew of 17 members, three per
ished, among the captain, a Norwe
gian. Consul Osborne also reported the
names of four of the seven Americans
aboard the ship as John Hartman,.
Philadelphia, and Daniel Nobal, John
Van Galen and Henry Monaian, ad
dresses not given. Hartman is in a
hospital with a fractured hip. The
other three are on the way to New
York aboard the steamer Taxandrier,
due to arrive here April l.T'
London, March 14 A Reuter des
patch from Christiania says it is re
ported there that the Norwegian gov
ernment has asked Germany whether
a German submarine torpedoed the
Norwegian bark Silius which with
seven. Americans on board, was sunk
last week off the French coast. If the
Silius was thus torpedoed, the des
patch says, an explanation of the con
ditions under which the attack was
ma.de is requested.
AUSTRIA CITES ATTACKS.
Washington, March 14 Austria has
presented to the United States reports
of two instances in which it is charg
ed Austrian merchant ships were tor
pedoed without warning by allied sub
marines, presumably British.
ATTEMPT TO STOP
BOUT IS FAILURE
Albany, March 14 The attempt of
Assemblyman Martin G. McCue, of
New York, a former pugilist, to pre
vent putting on of the Willard-Moran
boxing contest met with failure today.
McCue, who last week was refused
unanimous consent to introduce a res-
olution calling upon the state athletic
commission to revoke . the license for
ha contest, moved today to suspend
the rules to permit its introduction
but the motion was defeated by a
voce vote.
McCue then rose to a question of
personal privilege and assailed a
sporting writer on a New York pa
per who had questioned his motives.
Referring to the fact that he was
formerly a prize fighter, he said:
"That is the proudest hair in my
pompadour," and he repeated his
charge ofast week that the Willard
Moran contest would not be an hon
est one.

Second
(Special to The Farmer)
Stratford, March 14 The adjourn
ed annual town meeting of Stratford
was held last night. As no town meet
ing is complete without a scrap be
tween Judge Charles E. Peck aid
Prosecuting Attorney Ivan L. More
house the two G. O. P. rivals and their
cohorts picked out the matter of lay
ing sidewalks, and locked horns.
Verbiage flourished and for most
of the meeting the question of what
the town tax should be was shoved
into the background. Judge Peck
made a few motions and his oppon
ents trampled on the'm.
One . of the features of the set-to
was a disagreement between two tell
ers, each representing one of the fac
tions. No matter how often each tel
ler counted, he found his side was in
the majority. To expedite matters,
the tellers were discharged and three
were appointed to take their places.
The boys paused for a moment in
their belligerency to unite forces
against the Connecticut Co. Unani
mously, they rapped the trolley ser
vice and drew up a resolution con
demning it. Then they went back
to the real business of disagreeing.
There weren't enougn chairs in the
hall and half the voters were stand
ing. A tax of 15.8 for the first district
nd 15.2 for the second was laid.
A resolution was introduced by
Judge Charles H. Peck asking that
sidewalks be placed on Ferry Boule
vard and from Main street on Bar
nu'm to the city line. Judge Peck
made an urgent plea for sidewalks,
saying that he did not care where the
walks were placed but cited these
two thoroughares as examples of the
great need for some permanent pave
ment. "Time and time one will see
children going to and from school
walking in the middle of the road,"
he said. "Consider the danger these
little ones are in ' f being' run down
by some kind of a vehicle."
Elliott Peck, chairman of the fi
nance board said that he was heartily
in favor of sidewalks but after all ex
penses are paid there will only be
$3,650 left with which to accomplish
this work.

DURKIN & LAAS
SETTLE SUIT OF
THEIR1AWYER3
High School Contractors
Agree to Pay About Half
of Lawyers' Claim
The suit brought by Attorneys
Marsh , Stoddard & Day against lur
in & La as, the New York contractors,
was settler this morning just before it
was ready for trial before Judge Gager
and a jury in the superior court.
The plaintiffs agreed to take $775
without cosi,s in settlement, although
they originally claimed $1,500. They
brought the suit to recover for legal
services to Durkin & Laas, who had
the contract for building the High
; school.
The defendants declared the bill ex
cessive in view of the fact that thej
had previously paid $225.51 for ser
vices. Testifies That Auto
Victim Was Befuddled
"Oforocki had been drinking and
he had a half pint of whiskey in his
inside pocket," declared Michael
Spellacy of 1339 Stratford avenue
when testifying today before Coroner
John J. Phelan. The coroner is in
vestigating the manner in which John
Oforocki of Hallett street was run
down Wednesday morning and injur
ed by a jitney bus driven by George
Borek.
Oforocki is in a critical condition
at the Bridgeport hospital. Spellacy
told the coroner today that Ororockl
staggered into the street with hia
head down and paused for a second
in the gutter. He thought he was
going to stay there. Instead of that
he started forward in the path of the
car. In trying to avoid running down
the man Borek turned his car so
that it skidded completely around and
the rear of the car struck him, nock
ing him down. Two of his left ribs
were broken and one punctured his
left lung.
Spellacy told" the coroner he be
lieved that Borek was driving care
fully and that he did everything in
his power to avoid striking Oforocki.
In his opinion the injured man was
befuddled by drink.

TRUSTEES MAKE
PLANS FOR NEW
CLUB OFJAGLES
Insurance Adjusters Here to
Settle for Damage to
Old Building
MAIN STREET SITE
FAVORED FOR HOME
Efforts Are Made to Have
Neighborhood Lot Convert
ed Into Park Land
Adjusters from the insurance com
panies are expected here tomorrow to
confer with the committee of the
Bridgeport Aerie of Eagles to settle
damage caused by the recent fire at
Eagles' hall, Madison avenue. It is
the desire of members of the aerie
that some settlement be made at once
so that work may be started on re
pairs of the building. The aerie has ar
ranged a carnival to be held from
April 28 to May 9 and it is desired ;
that the hall be repaired so that it j
may be used by that 'time. Because !
of the nature of the damage the hall
Is not available for any social gather- j
ing at this time. Many societies that I
had planned affairs to be held t.here !
have been obliged to get other halls ;
or else cancel the engagements.
-The committee named on behalf of
the aerie to confer with the apprais
ers for the fire insurance companies
is: John L. Lynch, president of the
Aerie; Thomas M. McNamara, secre
tary; John 'j. Doyle, George M. Case
and Daniel Brolley, trustees, and Fire
Commissioner John H. Tague. As
soon as a settlement is agreed on the
work of repairing the building will
begin.
The aerie fwns the property on the
east side of Main street just north of
East Washington avenue and with the
proceeds of the carnival a building
fund will be established for the pur
pose of erecting a handsome home on
the location.
The members who were instrumen
tal in getting this property are anx
ious that a new home shall be erected
there as soon as possible. Considera
ble revenue is derived by renting the
large assembly hall and, the adjacent
ante-rooms in the present building in
Madison avenue and the disposition
of this building when tiyj new home
is erected is rather problematical.
Some members favor - keeping it for
the revenue it brings. Others propose
to sell the building and use the money
from the sale to "aid in building the
new home. Several offers for the
building and property which are con
sidered worth in the neighborhood of
$100,000 have been received.
At the carnival a five-passenger au
tomobile and $2,000 in gold will be
given away to aid the building fund.
Some time ago directly after the
Eagles purchased the new property
in Main street, Thomas H. Reddy,
then a member of the common coun
cil, proposed that the city purchase
the triangular plot at Main street,
Washington avenue and Catherine,
street. The plot is right at Bull's
Head and directly facing the Eagles
property. It is owned by the Mc
Mahon estate and has been for some
time occupied by bill boards. Be
cause of the peculiar shape of the
plot it could hardly be adapted to ad
vantage for building purposes. In
view of the fact that the Eagles were
to build a clubhouse in the neighbor
hood former Alderman Reddy thought
it would add to the attractiveness of
the section to have this property made
a public park. It would also afford a
breathing place for the children at
Bull's head.
The resolution, which he introduced
before the Common council was re
ferred to the park board but no ac
tion has been taken because the board
says it has no money for this pur
pose. THREE BUILDINGS
FOR Y.W.C.A. IS
LIKELIEST PLAN
Central Building, a Board
ing Home and East Side
House Projected
Three buildings will .be needed by
the Y. W. C. A. to carry on the work
for which the fund just raised was
planned. A central building contain
ing an auditorium, cafeteria, gymna
sium, swimming pool, class rooms,
clubs and offices is expected to cost in
the neighborhood of $175,000. The caf
eteria would accommodate about 200
persons a day.
A boarding home in a residential
section of the city, with rooms for 100
women and girls, is expected to cost
$50,000. A building fo- the East Side
owrk is estimated to cost $25,000.

(Special to The Farmer.)
Hartford, March 14. With John T.
King absent when the Republican
State Central committee met here to
day to name a date and place for the
spring convention, J. Henry Roraback,
the chairman, held the center of the
stage. He entertained the committee
men at luncheon and then relieved
himself in a few well chosen and dip
lomatic remarks.
Among his utterances was the ex
pression by Mr. Roraback that he
didn't think the spring convention
would send United States Senators
McLean and Brandegee as delegates
to the national Republican convention.
Mr. Roraback said he hadn't heard
that they wanted the jobs, and, be
sides, if he were holding down a sen
atorship, he didn't think he'd want to
go.
DEFER CHARGING
HAINES JURYMEN
UNTIL TOMORROW
Arguments of Prosecution
and Defense Are Heard
Today
Opening arguments of prosecution
and defense in the case of Jason S.
Haines, charged before Judge James
H. Webb and a jury in the criminal
superiov court with killing his wife,
Anna, at their homestead in Trum
bull last' September, began this morn
ing before a court room which was
crowded to itis capacity.
Closing arguments will continue
until late this evening, with the
charge to the jury by thecoiirt de
ferred until tomorrow morning. It
is likely that a, verdict may be reach
ed tomorrow afternoon.
Assistant State's Attorney Galen A.
Carter summed up the case for the
prosecution at the opening of court
today. He began by quoting from
the statutes showing that intoxication
was not an excuse for the crime. He
characterized Haines as a' brute and
intimated that his insanity was feign
ed. He dwelt upon the episode in
Fairfield last July when Haines is al
leged to have threatened to kill liis
wife and said that before her death
Mrs. Haines had predicted what
would happen to her. "Haines shot
her as no-man would shoot a dog,"
he said, averring that the act was
committed with premeditation, delib
eration and mali-ie.
Attorney Carter said that the state
would like to show what happened
in the home three or four minutes
prior to the shooting but Haines had
"luckily" forgotten what happened.
Edward F. Ratigan's veracity had not
been impeached, the prosecutor
thought. That Haines was not crazy
the state contended had been proved
by the fact that Haines is said to
have told Deputy Sheriff Emil Ber
ger "I killed her because I had a
right to."
The state contended that three
shots had been fired, one inside and
two outside of th? house.
A recess was taken after which
Judge Robert E. DeForest, of counsel
for the defense, arose.
Quoting authorities upon drunk
enness and insanity in the cases of
murder. Judge DeForest told the jury
that there was no law of nature that
compelled the taking of a man's life
because of a killing that such an act
was merely a human institution. He
then told how the minds of the public
might be swayed by reports and ask
ed the jury to consider only the ac
tual evidence they heard in court.
He characterized the statements of
Jason Haines, Jr., on the stand as of
the utmost importance to the defense
as showing that Haines was of a
peaceful, law abiding nature, having
undergone much in 2 0 years of mari
tal life. He was always forgiving
and kindhearted, he said, even up to
the hours before the crime when he
had gone himself for a physician to
treat wounds he had unintentionally
inflicted.
The state had said Judge DeForest
ad not shown that) Haines was sane at
the time and specifically showed that
it was not necesary for the accused to
show his insanity. Judge DeForest
asked the jurymen to weight in their
own minds the doubt that might exist
and if in the minds of one of these
there should be a doubt than Haines
should not be accused of first, or even
second degree murder.
Haines was a kind-hearted man,
should be the deduction from testi
mony offered by many witnesses, in
cluding the physician who had been
called to attend Mrs. Haines and from
the statements of fact shown, declared
the counsel. On many occasions
Haines avoided trouble by walking

As to the gubernatorial candidates,
the chairman said his attitude is "en
tirely neutral." He denied that he
opposes the candidacy of Speaker
Frank E. Healy, of Windsor xicks,
and said that Gov. Holcomb, Lieut.
Gov. Wilson, Controller Webster,
Speaker Heuly or Dennis Blakeslee
would satisfy him as a candidate.
William E. Seeley held the proxy of
John T. King, of Bridgeport, and J.
A. BT. Robinson that of Alexander L.
DeLaney, of Bridgeport. The other
representative from Bridgeport is Ar
thur F. Connor who is head of the mo
tor vehicle department of the secre
tary of state's office.
indications before the executive
session committee began were that
Hartford would be selected as the

ably will be called for some time
late in April.

MacFayden.
Courtade Leaves Job
of Cleaning Streets
To the Sun and Rain
No attempt has been made to clean
the snow from Cannon, John or. Bank
streets between Main and Broad
streets. In consequence there are
deep ruts in the snow and ice which
make it extremely difficult for
heavily loaded trucks to get through.
Trucks were stuck in all these streets
today and held up traffic until as
sistance could be obtained to move
them. So far as could be learned Di
rector of Public Works Courtade has
given up all efforts to remove any
more snow. He was not at city hall
today and could not be located.
