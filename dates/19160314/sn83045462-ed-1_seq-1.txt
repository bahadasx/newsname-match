_ ; Ch
Senator Sheppard of Texas today in- !
tmduced in the Senate important !
a rnr ndments t<> Itis prohibition bill. '
u'hicJi has been reported to the Senate ;
and is now upon the Senate calendar.
Tlmse amendments would permit the '
person;'. 1 use of alcoholic beverages in
flic District, which tite original bill attempts
to prohibit absolutely. The
amendments offered today restrict the
operation of the proposed law. so that j
:t is designed only to prohibit all traf- I
fie in alcoholic beverages and their j
manufacture for beverage purposes in j
the District.
Senator Sheppard. in offering the
amendments today, said that he would .1.,
address the Senate in explanation of the |
amendments later in the week. The i
amendments were ordered to lie upon the j
t a hie and will bo taken up when the bill tilt
comes before the Senate.
The proposed amendments also would CC1
change the Dill so that it would be possible
to ship liquor to persons in the Dis- 111 ^
trie t for their own use. but not for
traffic in alcoholic beverages.
Provides Other Changes. ln
Another amendment would permit the ^ 1*
manufacture or importation of grain al- tiv
cohol for medicinal and scientific purposes.
The original bill prohibited this.
The use of alcoholic beverages for re?
sacramental purposes in churches also
is permitted under the amendments of- t.*C<
feted today.
One of the amendments would include *'^1
in the definition of the term "alcoholic
liquors" against the traffic in which
the hill is aimed, "all malt and other
alcoholic liquors."
The provisions of section 2. limiting \y}
the .sale of pure grain alcohol to quantities
of five gallons at one time by tilt
wholesale druggists only, are eliminated.
as also are the sections on the JOl
sale of ethel alcohol.
Another amendment would strike out
section 3 as it stands in the hill, relating
to penalties for violations of the
eliminated provisions of the hill It _
provides a new section 3, regulating the
sale of alcoholic liquors by registered ( jdruggists
or pharmacists.
