"A Fat in 333 Day*.
One of tljte real attractions on the
dairy train operated oyer the Illi
nois C«ntral Railroad by the Iowa
State Dairy Association and which
will visit this city tomorrow, is the
exhibit of the seven-year-old Jersey
cow, Count's Miss Marigold, 250951.
This cow has not yet finished her
yearly record. But in 333 days, un
der average farm conditions and
with only ordinary care, she has giv
en 9,685.6 pouhdB of milk, which is
the equivalent practically of 4,842.8
quarts, Her average butter-fat test
was 5,92 per cent. In the 333 days
she has produced 574 pounds of but
ter-fat and made 675 pounds of but
ter.
At 30c per pound the butter-fat
income of this cow for the 333 days
would have been $172.50. Her milk,
however, was sold at 10c a quart,
so that she really produced $484.28
in gross revenue.
During this time she has eaten 5,
010 pounds of corn, silage worth
$10.02 1530 pounds of alfalfa hay
worth $11.48 899 pounds of hom
iny feed worth $10.79 686 pounds
of bran worth $7.54 700 pounds of
Schumacher feed worth $8.58 332
pounds of Gluten meal worth $4.73
350 pounds of ground oats worth
$5.25 and 104 pounds of oil meal
worth $2.08« ^Besides she was on
pasture a part of the time for six
make, the total cost of the feed con-
sumod $66.67.
She produced a net profit from a
standpoint simply of the sale of but
ter-fat at 30c a pound of $105.83.
Figuring ljer milk gelling at 10c a
quart, sbe produced a net profit of
$417.61. The care, making butter
or delivering the milk is not figured.
In addition to this, her calf, a
'-bull, sold tor $250 when six months
old. Thta cow is owned by the Wat
erloo Jersey Farm. The account
given of this oo^r is especially Inter
Nesting as showing to the fanners
what a really good Jersey cow will
do if given half a chance. Note .that
her average butter-fat test for the
year is nearly 6 par cent as compared
with the test of 3.00 to 3.5 the farm
er's herd usually averages.
An interesting thing about this
cow is her great size and evident
strength and power as a producer of
milk and cream, as well as the re
finement whicl» always makes a Jer
sey cow appeal to you.

However, troops will continue to be

that the National Guard will be call

Col. Hyatt was seen this after
noon and said he knew nothing of
any orders being issued, but declar
ed that he and Company would be
ready to go on shbrt notice. The boys
are anxious to respond to the call
and if the National Guards are or

This cow is not for sale,' but is val
ued by her owners at $3,000. She is
insured against death from any
cause, Including! sickness or acci
dent, for what might seem like a
large sum.
Benefit Makes Good Sum.
The high school benefit program
at the Orpheum Friday night, which
was backed by the freshman class
for the benefit of the high school ath
letic fund, netted them about $52
Other methods of making money will
'probably bo used in turn by the up
per classes of the high school.
A young business man of the city,
who desires his name withheld, of

the freshman girl who could sell the
largest number of tlckets- Miss- Al

GO tickets.
•XViVA
AT BAPTIST CHURCH
Edifice is Crowded to the Doors—
Selections by Band- are Much
Appreciated.
The Baptist church was crowded
to the doors Sunday afternoon long
before {he hour of 2 o'clock, the an
nounced time for the beginning of
the sacred concert under the aus
pices of the Juniors of the city. Ev
ery Sunday." afternoon for several
months children have been meeting
at this hour at the Baptist church,
under the direction of Mr. and Mrs.
George Steep, for an hour of song
and discriptlve Bible study.
Sunday the Commercial League
band kindly responded to the invi
tation to give a sacred concert at
the church and Prof. Beebe, leader
of the band, came over from Iowa
Falls to assist in the program.
The concert opened with "Amer
ica" by the band, in whl^ch the audi
ence Joined heartily in the singing.
As the first strains of the patriotic
selection were sounded, two boy
scouts marched down to each side of
the rostrum on which were seated
the youngest members of the junior
class, and waved large flags as the
song was given. After this number,
Rev. C. V. Pence offered prayer.
The other selections given by the
band were heartily appreciated by
the audience. Miss Ella Graffunder
assisted in the program1 with three
solos and during thfe singing of the
last, George C. Staples drew as she
sang—"The Chup«b itt the Wild
wood." This numjier was especially
appealing to the audience.
A vocal solo, "Sweeter Every Mo
ment," was very well given by Mas
ter James White, while two other
solos augmented the pleasure of the
afternoon. Prof. Beebe rendered an
effective clarinet solo, with Mrs. W.
H. Cook at the piano, and the cornet
solo by Merlyn Best was also heart
ily encored by his hearers.
Rev. 'J. O. Staples and Mr. Steep
each gave a few remarks explana
tory of the work of the Juniors on
Sundays and the entire program was
greatly enjoyed by those who were
fortunate enough to obtain seats ip
the .church.

EXPENSIVE FIRE
ON THE NORTH SIDE
House Owned by Mrs. T. F. Hook,
Together With its Contents,
Badly Damaged.
Saturday a'., m. the fire depart
ment was called out by a fire in the
house 6wned by Mrs. T. F. Hook on
the nortfe side, at tbe corner of Des
Moines and Stocltdale streets, and
occupied by W. E. Hawiey, manager
of the Central Heating Company.
The fire caught in the roof, probably
from .the chimney. When the de
partment arrived upon the scene the
fire had made little headway and
would have been easily controlled
but for the fact that the hydrant at
that corner was frozen. The hose
was attached to the hydrant on Will
son avenue, a block away, but before
water could be thrown the flames
had gained considerable headway,
and much of the roof upon the main
part of the Ijouse was In flames. A
second hose was attached to the hy
drant on Prospect street and soon af
ter two streams of water had been
playing upon the fire it was subdued.
Much of the furniture was carried
out and was of course more or less
damaged. 'The water did much dam
age also to the plastering and inter
ior of the house. The house was
built about forty years ago by R. K.
Eastman and was later re-modeled
by J. W. Allington, and was one of
the finest in that part of the city.
Mrs. Hook, owner of the property,
has been living in Canada a number
of years.

CREATESMERRIMENT
The Reorganized Methodist Epworth
League Enjoys a Big
Time.
Some seventy young people thor
oughly enjoyed themselves Saturday
evening at the Methodist. Epworth
League social held in tha church
basement, yhe guests were request
ed to come 'attired in "kid" clothes,
as the affair was a "country school."
That these grown-ups had not for
gotten their childhood days was evi
dent, not only by their appearance
but by their actions—throwing paper
wads, drawing chalk pictures of
"teacher" on the black board, yel
ling "teacher," etc. Pieces were
spoken, songs sung by different mem
bers of the "school," and the teach
ers, Mrs. Elsie Newell and Miss
Grace Bidlack, were taxed to their
utmost in keeping order. Mrs. J.
C. Coiburn, a "member of the board
of education," was a caller at school
and expressed herself quite freely on
the Beemingly loose rein the teach
ers held upon the pupils—much to
the consternation of the latter indi
viduals. As the day was Friday—
the last day of school—it was duly
celebrated by "spelling down"—and
those who participated would win
the prize in a short course spelling
match without half trying! At the
close of school slips of paper were
passed and partners matched for the
lunch which was served—the boys
having a state and the girls the cap
ital city.
The entertainment was given in
honor of Miss Joy Smith of Fort
Dodge, the Methodist deaconess who
has created much enthusia&m among
the young people of this church dur
ing her week's work among them.
Miss Smith returned to Fort Dodge
this morning.
