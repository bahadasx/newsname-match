El Paso, Mar. 14. Fear, for BOO
American Mormon colonist, in Chi
huahua were renewed this afUrnooa
when a Villa deserter arrived at
Casas Grandes, reporting the bandit
chief wa marching against the set
tlement, determined to exterminate
th colony.
Information to this effect reached
Carranzlsta official, at Juarez over
th restored telegraph lines.
Despite earlier constitutionalist
claim of Villa being surrounded by
Carranza troops, he was said to bare
arrived at Casa. Grande, and to hav
demanded surrender of the Carranxa
garrison there as well a. of th Amer
lean colonists. VDla v has burned
every bridge on the Mexican North'
western railroad between Sablnal and
Corralltis, making it impossible for
the Vain awaiting the Mormons at
Pearson to travel toward the border.
According to tho deserter's story,
Villa became enraged over, stories
that the Mormons were to act as
guides and scouts for the American
expeditionary force.
Tho loss of half of his 600 men at
Columbus by the fighting around th
town and by subsequent desertion,
further angered Villa' and he swore
to kill Americans, men, women and
children.
"MILITARY RECIPROCITY:"
ACCEPTABLE TO MEXICO
Washington, Mar. 14. Jose Acuna,
representative of the Carranzlsta gov

OF SILIUS SINKING
. Washington, Mar. 14. Trouble be
tween the . central power, and the
United States over the. alleged un
warned torpedoing ot the Norwegian .
bark Stilus with seven Americans
aboard as members of the crew Is ex
tremely unlikely, according to the
beBt German authority here today. ,
It was said If it was proved a Ger-
man submarine sank the Stilus with
out warning, the kaiser would un-'
doubtedly disavow the act and make ,
all reparation required. ,
The Austrian and German , em
bassies have not received any report
on the Stilus case. Meanwhile there
la doubt that the vessel was torpe
doed, In view of the fact that It was
an unarmed neutral. Many bollove ,
a mine responsible.
The American consul at Havre con
firmed the report of one American
sailor having been Injured. He has
not enlightened the government with
! regard to his previous report that the
stilus was torpedoed.
