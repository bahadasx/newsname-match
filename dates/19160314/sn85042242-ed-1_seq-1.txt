One of Bismarck's Most Promi
nent Business Men Called
Home.
EVERYONE SHOCKED
AT SUDDEN DEATH
Residents of the capital city were
shocked yesterday morning on learn­
ing of the death of Abram W. Eppin
ger, one of the most prominent busi­
ness men of the city. Mr. Eppinger
had been in Chicago for the last three
weeks where he underwent a slight
operation on his nose in the Michaei
Reese hospital. He had recovered
from the operation, but while visiting
a relative there was stricken with
grippe, which later turned to tonsil
itis, death resulting at 2 o'clock Mon­
day morning. Death was due to blood
poisoning which caused acute dilation
of the heart.
Mr. Eppinger was in his usual
health when he left the capital city
and had been some time doing his
spring buying for his clothing store.
For the last 14 years Mr. Eppinger
had been one of the most progressive
business men of the town. When he
first started in the clothing business,
after his father's der th, the firm was
known as Eppinger and Hoover. Lat­
er he bought Mr. Hoover's interest.
He was born in Sioux City, Iowa,
March 17, 1875, and had he lived until
the 17th of this month would have
celebrated his 41st birthday. Mr.
Eppinger was the son of the late Mey­
er Eppinger, a prominent business
man in the capital city for many
years, and Mrs. Mollie Eppinger, who
survives. Coming with his parents to
Bismarck when but three years of
age, he had since resided here. He re­
ceived his education in the local pub­
lic schools and when 15 years old was
graduated from the high school.
Mr. Eppinger numbered his friends
by legions. He was affiliated in many
of the local lodges, including the Ma­
sons, Knignts of Pythias, Elks, United
Commercial Travelers and was vice
president of the Commercial club.
His bereaved mother was prostrat­
ed at her home yesterday. Kind
friends ministered to her during the
long day until she departed last eve­
ning on train No. 2 for St. Paul,
she will meet the body. Alet
ter bitten by her son Friday was re­
ceived by her this morning. Much
sympathy u» expressed for Mrs. Ep­
pinger in hef sreat bereavement. Be­
sides his motheh a sister, Mrs. Syd­
ney Cohen of Wah'pM^n, and an aunt,
Miss Nathan, who ma&« her home
with Mrs. Eppinger, survives.
Mrs. Eppinger was accompanied to
St. Paul by her sister, Miss Nathan,
R. L. Best, W. A. McDonald. A. J. Os
trander and Mrs. W. A. McDonald,
representatives of the various orders
of which the deceased was a member.
They will be met in Fargo by Mr. and
Mrs. Cohen. The body will be ac
companicd from Chicago to St. Paul
by a relative of the deceased, where
services will be held. Interment will
be made in St. Paul besides that of
his father.

London, March 13.—Switching their
activity from the east to the north­
west of Verdun, the Germans again
are hammering at the salient of Le
Morte Homme and the region of the
Bois Bourrus, in an endeavor to bring
their lines farther south on the west­
ern flank of the fortress.
To the east of the Meuse and in
the Woevre district there has been a
noticeable let up in the bombaidment
on both sides. The infantry every­
where on the Verdun front has been
inactive.
In line with the bombardment of
Le Morte Homme and the Bois Bour­
rus, the Germans are assembling men
in the region between Forges and the
Bois des Cor beaux, probably with the
intention of throwing them into the
fray should the intense bombardment
meet with success. The French artil­
lerists, however, have had this as­
sembling point under Hie fire of their
guns. No advantage is claimed by
either side in the latest lighting
around the fortress.
Bombs
On Verdun.
Back of the German line lo the'
north of Verdun, an aero squadron
dropped 100 bombs on the station at
Berillus, and at numerous poinls
around Verdun French and German
aviators have met.in combat in the
air with the advantage incontestable'
in favor of the French, according to
Paris.
At least three German aeroplanes
are claimed to have..been brought
down.
In tiie region ,of Seppois, upper Al­

Washington, March 13.—The Unit­
ed States government entered into a
formal agreement with the de facto
government of Mexico today, under
which American troops will cross the
border to hunt down Villa and his
bandits, with the expectation of
hearty co-operation from the Carran­
za forces.
Secretary Lansing made public the
text of a note accepting General Car
ranza's proposal for a reciprocal ar­
rangement between the two govern­
ments, and announcing that the Unit­
ed States held this arrangement to be
now in force and binding upon both
parties.
General Funston will carry out his
task under this agreement. Ofiic.ial
announcement was awaited tonight
that the American force had crossed
the border. Plans for the troop move­
ments have gone ahead without re­
gard to the diplomatic exchanges.
Make Statement Public.
Mr. Lansing also made public a
statejnent issued in the name of Pres­
ident Wilson, reiterating that every
step being taken by the administra­
tion was based on the deliberate in­
tention lo preclude the possibilitty of
armed intervention in Mexico.
The note to Carranza defines I he
terms of the agreement beyond the
possibility of misconstruction. In
brief, it provides that, where condi­
tions arise on the American side of
the border, similar to those at Col­
umbus, which led to the orders to
General Funston lo enter Mexico, the
same privilege will be accorded to
tlie Mexican de facto government
without Ii'e necessity of a further ex­
change of views.
It, is clearly stated, however, that
the bandits to be pursued on Ameri­
can soil by Mexican troops must have
come from the American side, com­
mitted depredation on the Mexican

Washington, March 13.—Danger of
grave complications growing out of
the sending of American troops into
Mexico to hunt down Villa and his
bandits was urged in the senate today
by Senator Chamberlain, chairman of
the miltary committee, and Senator
Borah, republican, in advocating lay­

lation in order to dispose promptly of
preparedness pleasures.
Their statements precipitated a
long discussion, in which Senators
Vardaman and Simmons deprecated
suggestions that the United States
was not prepared to deal with any
situation that might' arise in its re­
lations with Mexico.
While the senate debate was in pro­
gress, Speaker Clark and Majority
Leader Kitchin were presenting to
their colleagues of the house on a
conference early in the day with
President Wilson, who urged them to
speed up the legislative program,

VILLA SHIFTS
Wires From Juarez Were Cut by
Members of the Bandit
Army.
FOUR THOUSAND SOLDIERS
CONCENTRATED ON BORDER
£1 Paso, Texas, March 13.—Villa
has taken a sudden twist to the east­
ward, according to a report received
tonight by General Gavira at Juarez.
This move apparently takes Villa
away from the territory where he has
been supposed to seek refuge and
north of which the concentration of
American troops has been heaviest.
This information was received by
Gavira from his subordinates. Col.
Gonzales, who commands the troops
protecting the Mormon colony at Ca
sa Grandes.
The wires from Juarez to the col­
ony were cut last night by Villa's
men. Gonzales restored them this
evening. Villa, Gonzales reports, is
now at Galeana, a town about 20
miles due east of Corralitos, where
he was last previously reported.
Brigadier General J. J. Pershing
and his entire staff left here late to­
day for Columbus. General Pershing
went on a special train, leaving his
personal baggage to be sent after
him.
This means that the headquarters
of the main expeditionary force has
been shifted from here to Columbus,
where nearly 4,000 troops, represent­
ing the three amis of the service,
cavalry, artillery and infantry, al­
ready have been concentrated. This
force has practically completed its
equipment and accumulating of sup­
plies and is approaching campaign
form.
Commander Arrives.
General Pershing arrived at New
Mexico tonight from El Paso. It is
understood he is to assume immedi­
ate command of the troops already
concentrated here for the punitive ex­
pedition against Villa into Mexico.
Commands now at Columbus mus­
ter approximately 3,500 men.
Several other commands are ex­
pected, the plan apparently being to
make the column to move out of Col­
umbus the main unit of the expedi­
tionary force, with field wireless and
aeroplane equipment.
General Pablo Bertani, command­
ing the garrison of 2,(KM) Carranza
troops at Palomas, six miles south of
the border, today notified American
military authorities that he expected
to call on General Pershing for a con­
ference.
Not In Mexico.
Late tonight General Funston said
the expedition would not get under
way tomorrow morning. He charac­
terized all rumors that troops were
already in Mexico as absolute false­
hood."

Motor Train Being Prepared tai
Handle Supplies of the
Army.
San Antonio, Tex., March 15.—A
sufficient force Is now gathered at the
Mexican border under the command
of Brigadier General John J. Pershing
to begin the pursuit of Francisco
Villa, it was announced tonight by
Major General Frederick Funston.
The general said that only the com­
pletion of plans for backing up the
expeditionary force now was needed.
He was non-committal, however, as to
the time needed to accomplish this.
General Funston declared reports
that American troops had been order­
ed to cross the border in pursuit of
Villa were untrue. Reiterating previ­
ous statements, he said it would be
useless to send anything but a strong,
well-prepared force into Mexico.
To Be Strong One.
That the expeditionary force will
be a strong one was indicated by a
statement of the general that when
the expedition was fully organized,
there would be only six or eight regi
ments other than those on the border
left in the United States. This did
not take into account' troops in the
canal zone and the Philippines.
Outside of mentioning two or three
scattered movements, the general re­
fused to give any definite idea of the
size of tne expedition, by stating
what regiments had been ordered to
the border.
General Pershing Command*.
General Funston's announcement
today that Brigadier Pershing would
command the, punitive expedition was
the first official statement that Gen
eral Pershing would be given the as­
signment, although it' had been, sup­
posed he would get it.
To General Pershing will be left
the final disposition of the force.
The expeditionary force into Mexi­
co is to be equipped with a complete
motor supply train, an innovation in
the United States army, it was an­
nounced today. Motor transportation
of supplies was deemed necessary «y
General Funston, as after the expedi­
tion gets well on its way, it probably
will get far from any railroad. "Word
was received today that the war de­
partment at Washington had author­
ized the purchase of 54 trucks, to be
organized into a complete supply
train. For the present, the train will
be manned with civilians.
Long Motor Train.
The motor train carrying supplies
v/ill have an important bearing on
the expedition's success, General Fun-,
ston said.
It became known today that lack of
rolling stock, particularly in Arizona
and New Mexico, has hindered troop
transportation
Reports reaching General 'Funston
late today indicated that difficulty of
transportation might be added to by
efforts of Villa's followers along the
border to destroy the lines of com­
munication.
Word came from Alpine, Tex., that
an attempt had been made to hold up
a train bearing Ambulance Company
7 and Hospital Company No. 7 from
Fort Sam Houton, on their way to
Paso by six Mexicans last night. The
attempt was frustrated because the
engineer sighted the Mexicans along
the track and stopped his train. The
Mexicans fled, but three later were
captured.
Reports from the border laid be­
fore President fWilson by Secretary
Baker during an hour's conference to­
night indicated that such progress
had been made in the mobilization of
American troops that the first force
of American troops were ready to
move against Villa at any time. Pres­
ident Wilson was said tonight to re­
sent deeply persistent reports that
the United States expects trouble
from Carranza. There was serious
discussion in official circles today to
stop publication of alarmist's reports.
