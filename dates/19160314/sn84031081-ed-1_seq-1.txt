Funston.
The general said that only the com
pletion of plans for hacking up the
i xpeditlonary force now was needed.
He was non-committal, however, as
to the time needed to accomplish this.
Earlier in the day Oeneral Funston
had announced tha the action of
Oeneral Carranza in refusing to per
mit American troops to enter Mexico
unless Mexican troops were allowed
to enter the United States in search
of bandits would have no effect on
tiie dispatch of the expedition.
No Crossing Ordenil Vet.
General Funston declared reports
that American troops hail been or-,
dered to cross the border in pursuit j
f Villa wore untrue. Reiterating
previous statements, he said, it would
be useless to send anything but a
strong, well prepared force into Mex
ico. That the expeditionary force will
be a strong one was Indicated by a
statement of the general that when
the expedition was fully organized,
there would be only six or eight regi
ments other than those on the bor
der left in the United States. This
did not take into account troops in
the canal zone and the Philippines.
Outside of mentioning two or three
scattered movements, the general re
fused to give any definite idea of
the size of the expedition by stating

To General Pershing will be left the
tinai disposition of the expeditionary
force. Orders will bo issued for the
forwarding movement by General
Funston at Fort Sum Houston hut
the hour when these orders will be
executed will be decided by the gen
eral in the field.
The expeditionary force into Mexico
is to be equipped with a complete mo.
tor supply train, an Innovation in
the United States army, it was an
nounced today. Motor transporta
tion of supplies was doomed neces
sary by General Funston, us after the
expedition gets well on its way it
probably will c,ot far from any rail
road. Two Motor Companies.
The train will be divided into twb
companies, each with twenty-seven
trucks. One company will be equip
ped with four-wheel driven cars and
the other with faster and lighter ma
chines. For tho present the train
will be manned with civilians.
The motor train carrying supplies
will have an important bearing on
the expedition's success. General
Funston said.
Two hundred horses also are to be
purchased at once to complete the
cavalry quota of mounts. These will
be dispatched to the border as fast
as they are obtained.
Although European stents have
been buying horses in the southwest
in huge numbers, it is not expected, tt
was alleged, that Hie government will,
have difficulty in getting good
mounts.
