BtonJj declaring that Carranza's pos
sible opposition would not stop the
expedition, the army heads in per
sonal command on the border were
laying their plans to strike into
Mexica from BH Paso, Douglas and
ColumbvfB, when the order to advance
is received. It may be Thursday or
Friday before the expedition moves
across the border, although with over
12,000 men, forty-eight batteries and
scores of machine gun squads already
at the boundary line, officers declare
themselves ready for the word.
Carranza troops were today show
ing more activity in northern Mexico
and near the border than for months
past.
A concentration of Carranzistas
was taking place at Nacozari, seven
ty-miles south of Douglas. Informa
tion received from Chihuahua City
was to the effect that a detachment
of five hundred cavalry men had left
for the Casas Grandes and Galena
districts to protect American Mormon
colonists and attempt to cut off
Villa's flight in that direction.
Genera Bertani, watching Villa's
line of retreat from P'alomas to the
west, predicted that the bandit chief
would either attempt to carry out his
threat against the Mormons, or go to
the rich state of Sinaloa so far al
most untouched by marauding bands.
General Canuto Reyes and 2,500
men, according to another report,
were said to be In the Torreon re

NO TROUBLE WITH GERMANY
OVER SINKING OF THE SILIUS
Norwegian Bar'k Probably

[United Press Leased Wire Service]
WASHINGTON, March 14.—Trou
ble between the United States and
Germany over the sinking of the Nor
wegian bark Silious, is altogether un
likely, it was said on the best of Ger
man authority today.
Should it be proved that a German
submarine torpeuoed the bark with
out warning, endangering the lives of
seven American sailors, Germany, It
was said, would undoubtedly disavow
the act of the submarine commander
and make all reparation required.
No report on the Incident has been
received by the German and Austrian
embassies. They are waiting for in
formation from the state department
or the Norwegian legation. In the
meanwhile doubt is expressed that the
vessel was torpedoed in view of its
apparently Inoffensive character.
While Villa's men has been fright-
U. S. and Carranzlsta u-oops near the
border, vigilance on the American
side has been increased since the Co
lumbus raid last Thursday. Troops
guarded the El Paso electrio light
plant and water works last night.
Similar precautions were taken along
the entire international boundary
line. Nearly every foot of American
railway tracks skirting the border
were, guarded by soldiers. With only
a single track paralleling the boun

according to all reports was not
armed and flew the flag of a neutral
nation. There would be no purpose
on the part of the teutonic allies in de
destroying her. Teutons believe in the
absence of any real information, that
a mine must have been responsible for
the disaster to the bark. Injury of one
American, John Hartman of Phila
