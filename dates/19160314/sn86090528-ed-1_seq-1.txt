JACKSON IN
RACE AGAIN
liert Jackson, at the present time
one of the representatives of tirady
county in the state legislature, has de
cided to enter the rae for re-election
and makes announcement of hi
Cbiididacy for the Democratic nomina
tion. ;
Mr. Jackson feels that the record
which ho ha3 already made is suffi
cient to make plain his position on
puLlic questions and he therefore does
-not announce any platform at me
present time, but later he will have
Bcmething to say In regard to issues
that may be pertinent in the cam
paign. Although ha Is serving only his
firsi term, Mr. Jackson's experience in
giylative work covers two sessions
and henco ha is thoroughly familiar
with the duties of the office, being
tetter prepared than ever before to
give the people effective service
Those who followed his career closely
while the legislature was inl session
declare that he was one of the most
faithful and substantial members of
'c house. He never sought the
limelight but contented himself with
quietly doing his work, gaining the
highest respect of his colleagues and
eartjing for himself the reputation of
being a doer rather than a talker.
Firm in his convictions, he never hes
itated for a moment to take a stand
for what he -believed to be right and
for the best interests of the state.
"If the people of Orady county ap
prove of niy record I shall be glad to
serve them again," said Mr. Jackson,
who is noi in charge of the 1'nion
hill school, a few miles southeast of
Chickasha.

through being Cleveland's mayor, re
fusing a third term. He has had a
s-kyrochet career. Baker lawed it to
get his star, jawed it to make people
know him, sawed wood when he had
a real job and thawed out when he

mayor in Refused to consider
a third term and quit office January 1,
IMG to resume bis law practice.
Baker's struggle upward has been
chiefly marked by perseverance. He
fought hard for the people in the long

successful in bis fight to give large
Ohio cities more complete home rule
He did much work in the municipal
lighting plant campaign, which re
suited in three cent ligbt for many
consumers.
Samuel. G. Blythe, political writer,
said Baker knew more about litera
ture than any mayor in captivity.
Paker has kep his knowledge in this
lespect, up to date. Forty-two centi
metre words are playthings for Baker.
His verbal artillery has routed many
a less vociferous opponent. He sinks
may obstacles in a sea of words.
Once some one told Baker he didn't
use enough "low brow stuff" in greet

while he was mayor. The next time
a newspaper man entered. Baker tried

JOHN BULL
SAYS INDIA
IS LOYAL
"Firm as Rock of Gibralter," Declares
British Official; Voluntarily Shares
Heavy Burden of Expense Im
posed by Great War
.f .i..j.
J'or months the word has
been flooded with unauthentic
eared reports that India, Eng
land's greatest colonial depen
dency, is on the verge of com
plete revolution. It has heard
from dozens of sources that
India will emerge from a
bloody struggle during the Eu
ropean war, to be the world's
largest republic.
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, March 1. (By : "Mai!.)
"Vbat is Uia real truth about India'"
This question was asked by the
United Press today in a quarter of
official London in such close touch
with Indian, day by day, that the an
swer can not te regarded as other
than official. The answer was:
"Indian is as firm as the Rock of
Gibraltar.
The present war has served as the
supreme test of the stability of Brit
ish rule In India. Tiiere ara 330,000,
000 people in the Indian empire and
consequent! some strife is inevitable,
in times of peace as well as in t'mes
of war. The responsible heads of the
various castes, members of the Indian
council, always are critical of the
government, but they are as loyal as
any British statesman who criticises
his government on the floor of the
house of commons
"An example of this loyalty Is
fchown in the fact that the Indian
council, at the beginning of the war,
agreed hat India should shoulder a
heavy burden of the expense. India
is doing this, ibut the burden 5s not
forced by England, as has been al
leged. The burden 13 assumed volun
tarily. Indian princes throughout the
empire have in many cases voluntari
ly given large amounts from their
tieasure stores to help the home gov
ernment. Indian native troops have
cone to almost every front and fought
with traditional native vigor, bravely
bearing the hardships of campaigns
w ithout a murmur. .
"The native of India today Is thor
oughly loyal to King George V, whom
ho looks upon as hte king-emperor.
This i3 not entirely due fo the British
rule in Indian. It Is explained by the
psychology of the native mind. Indian3
of all castes believe kings are made
through the workings of something
more than human intelligence. A
king, therefore, who rules the Indians
whether he Is the king-emperor or a
native king, does so by reason of the
fact thnt he ha been so designated
by something akin to the supernatur
al. The fact that a king rules India
establishes in the native mind that
king's right to rule.
"If India's 300,000,000 people were in
dined to revolt, the time for revolu
tion would be durinsc the greatest
war. Every Indian knows this and
still then has been no concerted ei-
frt to break away from British rule.
"Indian man power n l money pow
er will continue to aid Great Britain
throughout the war and in future wars
if necessary. There is nothing to wor
rv about In India."
