ON RECIPROCITY
tcred the United Stntes from Mex
ico, committed outrages on Ameri
can soil and fled into Mexico.
The Government of the United
States understands that in view of
its agreement, the reciprocal ar
rangement proposed by the de
facto Government, the arrange
ment is now complete and in force
anil the reciprocal privileges there
on may accordingly be exercised
by cither Government without
further interchange of views.
It is a matter of sincere grutifi
cation to the Government of the
United States that the de facto
States to apprehend and punish the
bands of outlaws who seek refuge
beyond the international boundary
in the erroneous belief that the
constituted authorities will resent
iny pursuit across tho boundary
by the forces of the government
whose citizens have suffered by tho
crimes of the fugitives.
With the same spirit of cordial
friendship the Government of the
United States will exercise the
prix'ilegc grantetl by the de facto
Government of Mexico in the hope
and confident expectation that by
their mutual efforts lawlessness
will be eradicated and peace and
order maintained in the territories
of the United States and Mexico
contiguous to

On the contrary, what is now being
done is deliberately intended to pre-
