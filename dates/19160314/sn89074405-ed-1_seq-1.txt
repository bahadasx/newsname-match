Some of the soldiers were killed be

Lucas was in command of the ma

battle barefooted.
Machine Guns Useless.
Why the machine guns failed to
work is a question asked by many.
The battle-.was in the dark, only two

one of these, a sergeant, was killed
and Lieutenant Lucas had only him

The Mexicans outnumbered us six

Pressure of Diplomatic
Affairs.

NO ATTEMPT TO
PURCHASE ISLANDS
Copenhagen^ via London, March 14.
—The Danish foreign office denies the
rumor that Germany haB offered $20,
000,000 for the Danish West Indies.
The American minister, Dr. Maurice'
Egan, also has taken: occasion to say
that there is not the slightest founda
tion in this report.
In the opinion of the Danish gov
ernment, the value of the islands has
greatly increased since the opening
of the Panama canal, and the sum
suggested would be regarded as en
tirely inadequate.
The semi-official Overseas News
agency of Berlin on February 21 char
acterised as nonsensical the story that
Germany had attempted to obtain
control of the Danish West Indies.
Cfeookston Vote.
Crookston, March 14.—The vote up
to 1 o'clock today was only 10 per
cent of the usual vote. A majority
of the voters are calling for demo
cratic ballots. There is great criticism
on the working, of the primary law in
not allowing voters to choose a can
didate to their liking and after exam
ine the ballots many refused to vote
at all.
This complaint is mostly among the
republicans. As a result the demo
crats are casting a majority of the
ballots.' A hot fight is on between the
Lynch and anti-Lynch delegates.' W.
Rowe is leading In the flght against
