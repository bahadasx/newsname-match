CARRANZA SEEKS DELAY
A WORD ABOUT PREPAREDNESS
As the first newspaper in the Northwest to preach preparedness* The Star is convinced, today,
that the nation even yet is only half awake to the danger which confronts it.
Cf It has been a week now since the bandit Villa raided an American city, killed American
citizen* in his mad lust for blood, and got clean away, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE CITY WAS SUPPOSEDLY GUARDED BY AMERICAN SOLDIERS.
C It has been a week since then, and, altho we've made a lot of talk about what we're going to do to Villa when we catch him, OUR ARMY IS STILL GETTING READY.
From El Paso today comes word that many troops ordered to the border from inland points have not yet arrived. No cars were available, it seems, in which to trans
port them. And there is no definite word as to when the chase after Villa is going to start.
C A lot of peanut congressmen are complicating matters further by yowling around today, back in Washington, about the way President Wilson is handling the affair.
And all this, mind you, is not a war, but just a little bandit-hunt.
What would happen if the United States, to preserve its honor, should have to go to grips with a first class world power? If one savage, unwashed bandit, a fugitive
from the law even in his own country, can turn the United States topsy-turvy like this, what under the sun would we do if we were called upon to make war against Ger
many, or Japan, or England?
The Star has published preparedness warnings in its columns since the very beginning of the struggle in Europe. It has published articles by the foremost experts in the
country. It believes in the efficacy of the Swiss military plan of compulsory TRAINING for the nation's youth. Today it publishes another article by Charles Edward
Russell on this particular subject which you are urged to read. Russell has studied the Swiss and other army military systems at first hand in Europe, where he went
expressly for The Star and its sister papers. He knows what he is talking about.
7 The Star believes the one paramount duty of this session of congress is to settle down, and stop its petty quibbling
over affairs nobody gives a hang about, AND GIVE THE NATION SOME ADEQUATE MEANS OF DEFENDING ITSELF.

GEN. PERSHING
REFUSES HIS
PLAY FOR TIME
EL PASO. March 14.—1t was reported this afternoon
the C'arranza government asked the United States, thru
Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing, to delay the start of the Ameri
can expedition two weeks.
Gen. Guiterrcz was said to have made the request. He
would neither deny nor confirm the rejMirt this afternoon.
Gen. Pershing's reply was rc]*>rted to have been such
that it angered Guiterrcz. Whether it was a flat refusal or
not Guiterrez would not say.
The delay i« believed t«> have been requested to give
Carranza time to capture Villa.
How the reported conference between the two took place
was not learned.
Fort Bliss authorities, in furtherance of the strict censor
ship, refused to admit Pershing had returned to El Paso from
Columbus, or that Guiterrez had talked with him on the long
distance telephone.
A Mexican railroad bridge, ten miles south of Juarez,
has been destroyed by fire. Carranza officials were unable
to account for it.
American military men believed it was burned in .in
attempt to prevent the L'nited States expedition from using
the railroad on it- advance into Mexico.
l.'nder Gen. Pershing, conqueror of the Moros anil the
Filipinos, organization of the main army division which will
hunt Villa began today.
Col. Slocum Will Lead Cavalry
Col. Herbert J. Sloctim, who "licked" Villa when the
bandit chief raided Columbus, was appointed to command the
"flying squadron" of cavalry which, it is believed will com
prise the larger part of the armed forces entering Mexico
from this point.
To investigate reports of Carranza's soldiers mobilizing nt
Palonias, in the direct line of the contemplated pursuit, den.
Pershing has arranged for a conference with Carranzis* i
Gen. Bertani. lie wants to ascertain it the Mexicans arc
planning to o|>pose his advance. The two will meet o;i
American soil today.
Gen. Pershing evidently i* awaiting reinforcements. More
cavalry was expected today, together with the signal and
aero-corps.
With nothing but single track railroads paralleling il:e
border to the west, the absence of strategic railways for mili
tary concentration is commented on.

sive military scheme for the sur

forces from enteritis Mexico,
