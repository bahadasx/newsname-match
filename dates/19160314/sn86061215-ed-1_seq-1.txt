Difficulty Encountered in
Getting Troops Ready
for Villa Pursuit
San Antonio, Tex., March 13.—
MaJ. Gen. Funston announced posi
tively early this afternoon that
there will be no movement of
troops across the border today.
Washington, D. C„ March 13.—
The United 8tates this afternoon
accepted Gen. Carranza's proposal
for a reciprocal arrangement by
which either of his troops or
American troops may pursue ban
dlts on either side of the border.
A note of acceptance was sent
forward to Gen. Carranza at
Queretaro.
Washington, D. C., March 13 —The
United States will reply to Gen. Car
ranza's request for a reciprocal ar
rangement for crossings of troops at
the Mexican border late today after
Secretary Lansing has conferred with
President Wilson.. It was indicated to
day that Carranza's proposal would be
accepted.
The acceptance probably will be
made on the ground that Carranza
troops may cross into American terri
tory in pursuit of bandits at any time
that American forces are not present
in sufficient numbers. It will be point
ed out that the inability of the Car
ranza troops to handle the situation
in northern Mexico is the sole ground
for entry of American soldiers. In
that way American officials expect the
situation will be relieved of its chief
menacing feature. They expressed the
view today that a great deal of un
necessary pessimism exists as to Gen.
Carranza's attitude. As to the attitude
of the American people themselves,
however, there is some concern but it
Is reallzyl that only the developments
of the next few days can clear up that
(thase of the situation.
CAPITAL IN SU8PEN8E.
Washington, D. C., March 13.—The
war department was still without ad
vices early today aft to whether Amer
ican troops had crossed into Mexico.
Secretary Baker riaid he had not heard
of any crossing and reiterated hia
promise to make that news public as
soon as it reached him. He added
that the morning's dispatches contain
ed nothing of importance that could be
given out.
There was no indication at the war
department that negotiations for reci
procal arrangement had in any way
altered the situation on the border.
Publication of Carranza's manifesto
declaring that armed invasion of
Mexico in pursuit of Villa would not.
be tolerated except on a reciprocal
basis apparently has not resulted in
any change of Gen. Funston's plans
to proceed with the pursuit of Villa
la his own way and at such time as
he thought best. Gen. Carranza yes
terday issued a manifesto declaring
that under no cirmustances would the
Mexican government gTant the right
to the United States to violate Mexican
territory by sending in an armed force
in pursuit of Villa without consent and
tho reciprocal privilege being first ob
tained and admitted.
May be
a
Bluff.
Army officials who studied the Car
ranza manifesto were convinced that
it was not intended as a communica
tion to the United States in any sense.
The head of the de facto government,
they pointed out, was in a delicate
political position, forced to satisfy con
flicting elements among his own ad
herents in whatever course he pur
sues. It was admitted, however, that
ii Carranza enforced the sentiments
expressed in his manifesto the pursuit
of Villa might be hampered seriously.
Discussion of tlie possible attitude
of Carranza or of the great mass of
the Mexican people is academic so far
war department officials are con
cerned. That phase of the situation
rests wholly wfth the president and
the state department.

GEN. FUNSTON ANNOUNCES HE
WILL REMAINON BORDER TO
DIRECT EXPEDITION.
San Antonio, Tex., March 13.—No
movement of the expeditionary force
-which will search for Francisco Villa
is probable today, MaJ. Gen. Frederick
Funston announced this morning. The
general waid preparations for the ex
pedition were going right ahead, de
spite Gen. Carranza's notification to
the Washington government that he
would not consent to American troops
•troops were allowed to enter the
United 8tates.
I It was officially announced that
Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing will com
mand the expeditionary forces. Gen.
Funston said he had received no noti
fication from Washington to hold
back the expedition while negotiations
were being completed with Gen. Car
ranza.
Gen. Funston said today that the
announcement of the.expedition's act
ual start into Mexico probably would
come from Gen. Pershing to whom
would be left the decision as to the
exact hour for setting the movement
afoot.
Shortage of rolling stock, Gen. Funs
ton said, was hindering the concentra
tion of cavalry at the base of opera
tions. The fault, he said, lay with
the railroads west of El Paso.
"We have even had to transport
men in box cars," he declared.
"When this movement is completed
there will be only six or eight regi
ments left in the United States other
than those troops stationed along the
border for patrol duly."
There will be no infantry or cavalry
movements from Ft Stun Houston for
the preset, it was announced today.
The first aero squadron, Capt. Ben
jamin D. Foulois commanding, went
forward to ElPaso this morning.
PERSHING MEET8 GAVIRA.
El Paso, Texas, March 18. —Gen.
Gabriel Gavira, commanding the Car
ranza forces at Juarez, came to El
Paso this morning to hold a confer
ence with Gen. Pershing, In command
of Ft. Bliss.
The conference of Gen. Gabriel Ga
vira and Gen. Pershing was the first
time that the two commanders had
ever met.
They came together in the office of
the Mexican consulate with Consul
Garcia as a third party. Nothing was
given out afterward except of a gen
eral nature.
"I have nothing to say except that
th* meeting was entirely satisfactory,"
said Gen. Pershing.
Gen. Gavira's comment was to the
same effect.
"If there is anything to be given out
it must come from Gen. Pershing,"
said Consul Garcia after his visitors
had left. But when asked whether the
dlecusslon was personal and informal
or in their capacity as officials of their
respective governments, he added that
it partook of both.
Altogether it lasted about half an
hour.
TROOPS GATHERING.
El Paso, Tex., March 18.—Daylight
revealed the beginning today of the
expeditionary force which the United
States army is gathering along the
border west of here for the pursuit
of Francisco Villa. Six mountain
guns, unloaded during the night,
were in readiness at Columbus, N. M.,
the scene of Villa's raid, and the first
armed camp to develop evidences that
it has been selected as one of the
starting points for a pursuit column.
Fifty-seven carloads of battery mules
and transport animals, also arrivals
of the njght. gave loud evidence that
more guns were coming. Eleven hun
dred men were in the Columbus camp
this morning.
Along 200 miles of the border west
of here troop trains were reported
passing various points during the
night, the result of orders released
Friday by the war department.
Nogales reported that a few can
non had been discovered in the Mexi
can hills facing the American boun
dary near there but elsewhere along
the line where the American troops
were gathering no signs of disquiet
ing activity along the Mexican side
were reported.
The drag for Villa sympathizers in
El Paso last night resulted in the ar
rest of four generals, one general's
secretary, a physician and an Ameri
can. The generals, all former Villa
commanders, were Manual Medina
veitia, once chief of staff, Julio Fab
ela, Samuel Rodriguez and Juan Ro
driguez. The American gave his name
to the police as E. A. Talbott The
physician, Dr. Villareal, was former
ly an active Villa worker.

Britons Reported to Have
Met Severe Defeat at
Hands of the Turks
London, March 13.—A pronounced
pause has come in the German offen
sive operations against Verdun, so far
as the infantry arm is concerned, ac
cording to the official bulletins from
Paris.
Sunday passed without infantry ad
vanced and the crown prince's troops
did not leave their trenches for an at
tack at any point during last night, the
French war office reports. The last In
fantry assault reported occurred on
Saturday, when the Germans entered
a small French trench north of Eix. In
the fighting around Verdun thus far
the Germans claim to have captured
26,472 unwounded French officers and
men and 189 guns and 232 machine
guns.
There has been no cessation of the
artillery play, however, the bombard
ment continuing along much of the
front. It was particularly severe in the
Woevre district, where the French
guns have been searching out hostile
positions, indicating the probability
that some move by the Germans to,the
east or southeast of the fortress on the
Frenoh flank is anticipated.
.. A small engagement occurred in Le
Prttre forest, on the left bank of the
Moselle, west of Pont-aMousson, to the
east of the St. Mihlel salient, where
the French report penetrating 200
yards of trenches and withdrawing
after destroying the German Baps.
French aviators bombarded the rail
road station at Conflans, where fires
were seen to break out.
Britons Meet Defeat.
T' British Mesopotamian force un
der Gen. Aylmer suffered casualties of
5,000 in the battle of March 8, when
it tried to advance up the Tigris to
ward Kut-El-Amara and was reported
defeated and obliged to retreat, accord
ing to the Turkish war office.
in Arabia, according to Constantin
ople, a British foroe trying to advance
inland from the Gulf of Aden was driv
en back by the Turks to the protection
of the warships in the gulf.
Russians Claim Advance.
In the Dniester region of East
Galicia the Russians claim to have
captured a number of trenches from
the Germans and to have taken the
town of Kirind from the Turks in
Persia.
A Russian torpedo boat destroyer
has been sunk in the Black sea by a
submarine of the central powers.
The Italians are still prosecuting a
vigorous 9ampaign against the Austro
Hungarians and are extensively bom
barding the Isonzo front.
The British fleet auxiliary Fauvette,
a vessel of 2,644 tons has been sunk
by striking a mine off the east coast
oi England.
OFFENSIVE AT END?
London, March 13.—An Amsterdam
dispatch to the Central News says
that on account of the German offen
sive at Verdun the Dutch-Belgian
frontier had been closed for several
weeks. That part of it south of Maas
tricht has now been reopened and this
fact is commented on in Holland as
probably indicating that Jhe Germans
consider their offensive near an. end.
The dispatch adds that eighty-one
more hospital trains with wounded
Germans from Verdun have passed
through Luxemberg.

FIGHTING ABOUT
VERDUN CULLED
THE WORST EVER
BRAVE EFFORTS OF GERMAN8 TO
8TORM FRENCH POSITION8
PROVE C08TLY.
Paris, March 13.—The German
losses in the fighting around Ft. Vaux
last Friday and Saturday surpass all
previous records in this war, accord
ing to officers who have returned from
Verdun. Time and time again the Ger
mans rushed from their trenches only
to melt away under the fire of the
French. When the smoke and dust
cleared nothing was to be seen but
heaps of bodies.
The spur on which the fort is situ
ated is almost perpendicular in certain
placeB.
The German lines were forced
to halt but many Bavarian reservistB
climbed up on one another's shoulders
and struggled up the slope, clinging
to angles of rock and grasping tufts
of grass. Again and again these hu
man pyramids collapsed into shapeless
gray masses. In the places where the
incline was easier and the attacks
therefore more concentrated, the
ditches below ran red with blood. At
the lowest estimate the attackers lost
two-thirds of their effectiveness.
The fighting also was desperate in
the extreme when regiments from the
fifteenth and eighteenth Germany
army corps attacked the village of
Vaux on Friday.
It took four distinct assaults before
the first column of Germans won the
shelter of a small group of houses be
yond the church of Vaux. They then
organized an assault upon the church
and the French, being unable to bring
up reinforcements on account of the
German curtain of fire, withdrew their
advanced elements which were in dan
ger' of being surrounded. Five times
the north Prussian regiments rushed
to. Attack live church but every-time
they left the shelter of the ruined,
houses they Were beaten back, In the
meantime in their rear a curtain of
fire was kept up so that it was impos
sible for munitions and reinforcements
to be brought up for their benefit and
the fight died down on Saturday night
from sheer exhaustion.
SMELTING FIRM

New York, March 13.—All Ameri

CAVALRY REGIMENT DISPATCHED

El Paso, Ttex., March 13.—Cavalry
troops have been dispatched from
Laguna on the line of the old Mexican
Central railway north of Chihuahua
City direct to Casas Grandes to aid
the 500 members of the Mormon col
ony concentrated at that point but
now cut off from communication with
either Chihuahua or Juarez.
Gen. Gavira, commandant at Juarez,
received news of the fiew cavalry
movement from Gen. Garza this morn
ing. It followed immediately on the
report of a scout train that made a
run down the Mexican and Northwest
ern line in the direction of Casas
Grandes but turned back upon seeing
smoke ahead at Santa Sofia, which
seemed to come from a burning bridge.
Villa was last reported in the neigh
borhood of Corralitos, not far distant
Assuming that Villa's forces were
there the train returned.
Some months ago the bridges on the
section of the road between Madero
and Temosachlc, below Casas Grandes
were destroyed by Villa. As the tele
graph wires to Casas Grandes stopped
working Buddenly'late yesterday, as if
cut, the Mormons are now completely
isolated. But Gen. Gavira says his
forces there are ample against Villa.

a torpedo, as previously reported.
The first officer was on watch at the
time and heard a noise whioh he
thought was an aeroplane, although he
could see none. Then there came a
terrific explosion at about the middle

a mast fell. A French torpedo boat

ANNUAL REPORT OF PRESIDENT
HINT8 AT COOPERATION
WITH THE MILITARY.
New York, March 13.—An increase
of more than $13,900,000 in'the gross
earnings of the American Telephone
and Telegraph Co., last year over 1914
is shown by the annual report of
President Theodore N. Vail, made pub
lic today. Total gross receipts of the
company, not including the connecting
independent companirs, last year were
$239,900,000. The company's net earn*
ings were $41,117,487 and dividends
amounting to $29,100,591.
The Bell system, President Vail re
ports, now connects 9,151,221 tele
phones, a gain of half a million sta
tions in a year. It is estimated that
$&7,000,000 will be spent in new con
struction this year. Tl$e company
added 1,029,951 miles to its system,
making a total of 18,505,545 miles. An
interesting feature of the report is
that substitutes for supplies used by
the company which previously were
obtained abroad, have been provided
by the engineering department.
The report declares that the en
gineering department has done "im
portant and confidential" work with
representatives of the army and navy
to work out a system of communica
tion "unequalled by any other nation,"
in connection with national defense
plans
Regarding the suggestion of public
ownership, President Vail declares
there is little likelihood of this as long
as the present policies are followed.
