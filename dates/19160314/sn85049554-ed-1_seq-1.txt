NACO FEARS ATTACK.
Border Town Spends Sleepless Night
Telegraph Wires Cut.
ftaco, Ariz., March 14.—Naco passed
a sleepless night as the result of a se
ries of reports which led the authorities
to believe that a raid from the Mexican
side of the border waa planned either
by Villa supporters or by deserters from
the army of Gen. P. Elias Calles, mil
itary governor of Sonora. However,
nothing came of it.
Officials here are unable to learn of
conditions at Cananea, Sonora, one of
the largest mining centers or Sonora,
which is operated largely by Ameri-
ing alarmist rumors from there.
Most of the woiiCen and children in
Naco have been sent for safety to Bta
bee, seven miles northward. Additional
troops have bieen brought here from
Blsbee to'reinforce the border guards
of 100 men.
The number of Mexicans across the
line is estimated at about l.oou.
