Judge J. T. Hanbery.
The melancholy end of the brilliarit
career of "Jack" Hanbery is a source
of profound and universal sorrow.
His friends were legion, not only in
his homo city and in the party that
had honored him with high office, but
,in all parts of Kentucky and in all
parties. A native of Christian county,
his success came largely through his
own efforts. He surmounted ob
stacles, overcame difficulties, urged
on by a boundless and laudable am
bition, always performing his duties
with a fearless and conscientious re
gard for law and justice. Without
the best advantages, ho accomplished
more than most men do with the very
best opportunities and made a reputa
tion on the bench that will live after
him in years to come. He was learned
in the law, with a wonderful fund of
legal knowledge representing years
fo studious application to his books.
He was just and impartial in his rul
ings. Ho was fearless and faithful
in doing his duty as he saw it. He
was kind-hearted and thoughtful of
the feelings of others and the hum
blest prisoner felt that he had a friend
on the bench who would see that he
was fairly treated. His friends be
lieved there were greater things in
store for Judge Hanbery, but his use
ful career is ended in gloom and the
grave is open to receive all that was
mortal of this upright man and judge.
Hughes' mud-slinging speech of
acceptance has attracted such atten
tion to the rotten-egg methods of the
Republican nominee in the present
campaign that the department of jus
tice, the department of agricultureand
the postoffice department have com
pleted plans for a rotten egg cam
paign in the United States, particular
ly in the cities. Information reached
the department of agriculture, which!
has charge of the enforcement of the
pure food law, that the storage com
panies were getting rid of an im
mense number of tneir veteran eggs
though the medium of the parcel post,
and investigation wan aba ted in con
junction with the department of jus
tice. It developed tint the informa-
tion was accurate and that the stor
age companies were unloading anti
quated and bad eggs tnrough ttie par
cel post, and also tlfougli the ex
press companies. Plain clothes men,
armed with ammonia bottles, will
doubtless be detailed to watch Re
publican headquarters to head off
these shipments of unlawful cam
paign materal.
It w i 1 1 be necessary for Gov.
Stanley to fill the vacancy in tho
office of Circuit judge as soon as tho
proprieties have been observed.
The fall terms of court are beginning
in all of the districts and few of the
judges will be available for special
duty. The Calloway Court began at
Murray yesterday and Gov. Stanley's
appointee may be expected to bo
sent there before the end of the week.
Those ilose to the Governor express
the opinion that he will tender the ap
pointment to Judge -Chas. II. Bush,

DEATH US
ABLE JUDCE
Judge J. T. Hanbery Expires
After Months of Intense
Suffering.
A VICTIM OF CANCER
Recognized as One of the
Ablest Circuit Judges in
Kentucky.
JUDGE J. T. HANBERY.
After many months of intense suf
fering from an incurable disease,
Judge John T. Hanbery sank into un
consciousness Sunday and during Sun
day night he peacefully passed away.
His ill health began something more
than two years ago. A small pimple
appeared on his face near the left
side of his mouth and before it even
attracted the attention of his friends
he went to the Mayps in Minnesota
and came back ap'parently cured. He
continued his -duties on the bench and
took part in the campaign last year,
that resulted in his re-nomination and
re-election in November for a second
term of s'x years as circuit judge,
His new term began last January
and no recurrence of his old trouble
occurred until about the middle of
March, when he v.:u taken ill while
holding court here. The month be
fore he had made speeches fdr the
good roads proposition and appeared
in his usual health.
He did not get over what was sup
posed to be a slight attack of indispo
sition and by the latter part of March
he went to Evansville Tor treatment
in a sanitarium whero it was soon
found that cancer in a most malignant
form was attacking the glands of his
body.
Various operations were performed
during the months that followed and
his friends and devoted wife hoped
against hope that some means might
be found to arrest the terrible disease.
Its progress was slow but sure and
before the first of June he was told
that his case was hopeless.
During the month of June his
friend, Rev. M. A. Jenkens, who was
holding a meeting here, went to
Evansville to see him amLJudge Han
bery talked calmly and with christian
resignation of his approachirg death,
sayinghat while he looked upon his
life work as unfinished ho was ready
to go.
Early in July he expressed an
earnest desire to bo brought back to
his old home hero and for several
weeks he had been in his room at
Miss Fannie Phelps', whero he lmd

ette, Ky., Oct. 20, 1807, tho only son
of Mr. and Mrs. Thos. C. Hanbery,
Ho was reared in that vicinity nnd
united with tho Littlo River Baptist
church in 1880.
Not long afterwards the family
camo to this city and this had ever
since been his home. He was edu
cated in the public aehoote bf the city
and in South Kentucky College.
Ag a boy he worked u shipping
clerk in the tobacco warehouse of
Buckncr & Wooldridgc, but his great
desire was to bo a lawyer and after a
few years he went into the office of
the late Judge J. I. Landes, where he
studied law and eventually was ad
mitted to the bar.
Soon after he began practice he
was appointed city attorney and later
served n term as city judge of Hqp
kinsvillc, filling both of these posi
tions with unusual ability for a young
man. His personal popularity also
brought him clients and he prospered
almost from tho beginning of his ca
reer as a lawyer, without the usual
period of waiting.
In 1897 he aspired to the office of
commonwealth's attorney and in a
memorable convention at Murray lost
the nomination by a fraction of one
vote.
He devoted himself to his practice
for twelve years and in 1909 ran for
circuit judge, defeating Judge Thos.
P. Cook for the democratic nomina
tion by 129 votes, in one of the hot
test races ever held in the district. As
stated above lie had no opposition for
his second term.
In 1896, Judge Hanbery was mar-,
ried to Miss Nola Rowe, who survives
him. He leaves no children. Both
of his aged parents died two or three
years ago. His nearest relatives are
three sisters, Mrs. C. D. White, of
Cadiz, and Mrs. Susie Shryer and
Mrs. J. T. Savage, of St. Louis.
The first named is in West Virgin
ia and will not be able to attend the
funeral. The others were with him
when he died. "Mrs. Hanbery's mo
ther, brother and sister arrived yes
terday from Evansville, Ind.
The funeral services will be held
this afternoon at 4 o'clock at the First
Baptist church, of which Judge Han
bery was a member. He was teach
er in the Fidelia Class of ladies in the
Sunday School, a class of 80 or more
members.
He also held membership in the
Masonic, Elks, Pythian and Wood
men orders.
The services will bo conducted by

STAMPEDE
Coming in Droves and Former
Republicans Are Found

MOVE STRONG AT COAST
In Washington, Oregon, Idaho
and California Entire Vote
to Go to Democrats.
New York, Aug. 7. Tho drift of
progressives to the support of Presi
dent Wilson has become a stampede
since their meeting in Indiananolis
last Thursday. Republicans, too,
are coming to the president's standard
in daily increasing numbers since
their candidate failed in his speech of
acceptance to create an issue that
would appeal to the intelligence of
the independent voter.
To National Chairman McCormick
and to the president himself come
every day letters and telegrams from
men who have been prominent in the
bull moose party and men who have
been up to now dyed in the wool re
publicans, who pledge their support
in this campaign. Chairman McCor
mick made public today a partial list
of republicans and former progres
sives who have openly declared them
selves for President Wilson's re-election.
TIDAL WAVE IN WASHINGTON
In the state of Washington the pro
gressive and republican stampede to
Wilson is most pronounced. Women
as well as men are included in the
list. Some of the more conspicuous
names forwarded to national head
quarters are Ole Hanson, progressive
candidate for United States senator in
1914; Edgar C. Snyder, progressive
state chairman; H, C. Piggetto, editor
of the Seattle Saturday Night, a pro
gressive weekly; Geo. W. Bright, W.
J. Dowling and J. II. Fletcher, who
were all on the progressive local
tickets in 1914; Henry Albei t McLean,
progressive candidate for congress;
C. J. France, chairman progressive
state convention, and many others.
In Idaho the tide has set no less
strongly toward Wilson. The Boise
Evening Capitol News, the most in
fluential newspaper in that state, has
swung from progressive organ to a
staunch supporter of the president.
HENEY LEADS IN CALIFORNIA.
The California stampede of the
moose, led by Francis J. Hency, pro
gressive candidate for the United
States senate, extends to every corner
of that state. The Woodrow Wilson
progressive league has enrolled thou
sands of members, and its ofiicers re
t0 national headquarters that the
! Wilso" vote will include practically
jtne entire bull moose vote of four
vears aCO.
, Mr. Hency is vice-president of tho
Wilson league in his state. Some of
the other progressive and republican
leaders of national prominence who
have declared for President Wilson
or against Mr. Huglias are Col. John
J M. Parker, of Louisiana, progressive
candidate for vice-presidnnt on the
i sold outtickotof 1910; Bambridge

ner of the farming firm of Draper
Bros., near Longview, committed

ing at 7:45 o'clock, by a pistol shot
fired into his body near the heart.

tragedy byk Richard Leavell, who ar
rived about 8 o'clock. There was no
one on the place except colored peo

They did not hear the shot, but the
pistol by his side left no doubt of the
manner of his death. He left no ex
planation, but it is attributed to ill
health and general dispondency.
