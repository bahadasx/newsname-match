a bury day too.
"Vocabulary DereloBina-. ,
Only-just 'storted Irt'hla campaigning,
Hughes today had developed an almost
Rooseveltlan vocabulary of denuncia
tion, and of aphorUin. Some of his epl
grama coined so far lire:
"The Democratic party Is a party for
"The Democratic party came up to
the protection tav like a skittish horse
approaching1 a bras band. .
"We're entitled to a -Handing army,

It is a base libel, this story that
Hughes Is "cold." No human being
could have perspired any more than the
former Justice oLthe Supreme Court baa
done since he left Brtdgehampton op
Saturday for his first trial of Presiden

nominee atlcka to his white pique vest

The collars wilt and drop over, but
Hughes Just grins underneath his beard
by the way it waa trimmed thla morn

grin and goes right ahead.
Everybody, of course, has shown great
Interest In Mrs. Hughes. That story
from Bridgehampton that she is carry -i

canard. It is reliably stated that there
are at least three. Up to date Mrs.
Hughes has worn two different ones
