By Associated Press
New Tork, Aug. 8. The four hun
dred thousand railway employes of the
country, engineers, conductors, fire
men and trainmen, to-day through the
chiefs of their four brotherhoods
placed before the managers of the
railroads the question as to whether
the roads were willing to grant their
demands for an eieht hour day and
time and half pay for overtime or
submit to a strike.
The result of the strike vote taken
among the employes during the last
month was presented to the national
conference committee on railroad
managers and showed that an over
whelming majority were In favor of
authorizing the chiefs to call a strike.
Give No Definite Answer
The railroad managers gave no
definite answer to the renewed de
mands of the men to-day and it was
agreed to adjourn until to-morrow to
give the managers time for further
discussion. A. B. Garretson. president
of the Order of Railway Conductors,
notified the managers that the time
for parleying was over unless the
roads were prepared to present a
modified proposition.
"If you are ready to prepare a
modified proposition," said Mr. Gar
retson, "we are ready to discuss it."
Elisha E. Lee, for the railroads
said: "I am not going to answer your
questions now, in a definite form. I
will take them up with the managers,
together with the result of the strike
ballot and all that refers to It. Whether
we have a proposition will develop by
our own discussion."
Mr. Garretson interrupted to say:
"I want you to bear in mind that your
company has not once brought us
anything resembling a definite proposi
tion."

CITY PLANNING COM
MAKE BIG SUBURBAN SURVEYS
Looking Forward to Time When Harrisburg Will Grow To
ward Linglestown and Mountains
With the rapid development of |
Harrisburg in every direction, the
work of the City Planning Commis
sion grows in importance. During the
present summer- there has been con- ]
siderable activity along the river north
of the city and some recent transfers
of larcre plots indicate a future expan- J
sion which requires no prophet to
foresee. The work of the Planning \
'""■ommifsion will involve comprehen
sive surveys of the territory, for in- '<
s'ance. between Division street and
the First mountain, and from the
ri' er miles toward Linglestown. This
survey would make possible the plac- j
ing of street lines and prevent such
conditions as caused a large expendi
ture by the city when Eastmere was
annexed to Han-isburg.
Those suburban developments
whkh grow like Topsy, involve diffi
culties in the future which are too ser
ious to contemplate with regard to
the greater Harrisburg.

HARRISBURG, PA.., TUESDAY EVENING, AUGUST S, 1916.
i Major F. M. Ott has shown a proper
appreciation of conditions in provid
! ing that what is now the Linglestown
I roac. running from the river drive
loward Linglestown shall be sixty
feet wide. Similar treatment should
be given all other roads and highways
north of the city, but this cannot be
j done unless and until the Planning
Commissiou shall have authorized the
! survey and indicated the character of
: the streets and park spaces.
It is inconceivable that the splendid
area north of Division street shall be
ruinea for all time by careless and
indifferent building operations. Also,
it is believed that the city must take
o"'er all the river frontage from Divi
sion street to Fort Hunter in order
that the greatest asset of the city shall
not be destroyed in that section which
must eventually be part of Harrisburg.
What is true of the territory north of
the city is also true of that outlying
; territory east of the city and south-
Iwardly toward Hummelstown.

Five-Cent Loaf of Bread
Waste; Urges Ten-Cent Size
By Associated Press
_ Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 8. A
o-cent loaf of bread is an economic
waste, in the opinion of C. N. Power
of Pueblo, Col., who to-day addressed
the convention here of the master
bakers of the United States. He dis
cussed the "ten-cent loaf and why "
Efficiency, declared Mr. Power de
manded the baking of ten-cent loaves
rather than. the fl% - e-cent size. He
estimated the cost of baking 1 000
L°, v ?? of bread cf the five-cent size is
"3.00 more than the cost of baking the
same flour into 500 ten-cent loaves.
"The overhead charge cannot be
Justified." continued Mr. Power "A
baker should jegard himself as an
agent of the people who use bread
with the sacred responsibility of pro
viding them with the most digestive
and nutritious bread it is possible to
make. This cannot be accomplished
with a five-cent loaf."

The giving out of this summer

Senate Agrees Without
Debate on Army Bill Which
Carries $267,597,000
Washington, Aug. 8. Without
debate the Senate to-day agreed to
the conference report on the army
appropriation bill carrying $267,597,-
000 for maintenance of the reorganiz
ed regular army and Natonal Guard.
The only criticism of the report
came from Senator Clapp, of Minne
sota, who protested against elimina
tion of the La Follette amendment
increasing the minimum age limit for
enlistment from 18 to 21 years with
out consent of parents or guardian.
Because of this he voted against the
report.
The bill provides for organization
of a council for national defense to
co-ordinate transportation, industrial
and agricultural facilities in time of
stress, for relief of dependent fam
ilies of so|fliers in service on the Mex
ican border, and appropriates a spe
cial sum of more than $13,800,000
for development of aviation in the
army.
The- naval bill also was in its last
stages to-day, although failure of the
conferees to agree on the important
building and personnel provisions
made necessary the less speedy
method of referring Senate and House
differences back to those bodies. If
the House, even under administration
pressure, refuses to accept the Senate
provisions for building sixty-six ves
sels, including eight capital ships, next
year and for an enlisted strength of
7 4,000 men, it is considered probable
the Senate will abandon its three-year
continuing program in an effort to
compromise. The House plans to
vote on this measure next Tuesday or
Wednesday.
I'RGES HOI'SE ACCEPTAXCE
By Associated Press
Washington, Aug. B.—President Wil
son summoned Senator Swanson and
Representative Padgett, representing
the Senate and House conferees on the
naval bill to the White House to-day
to gain information on the result of
the conferences and to urge again that
the House accept the Senate provisions
for a larger building program and in
creases in the personnel of the navy.
The president was told of the failure
of the conferrees yesterday to reach
an agreement on these two features
! and was informed that a vote on the
| conference report, would be taken in
j the House next Tuesday.
President Charged With
Forcing Democrats to Adopt
Laws Against Judgment
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Aug. B.—Senator
' Cummins to-day charged President
Wilson with forcing Democrats in the
| House and Senate to adopt legislation
I against their Judgment and told op
ponents of the child labor bill who
I contend it is unconstitutional that the
presidential assumption of legislative
functions was a greater menace to
the constitution than the passage of
any measure.
"There has not been a single impor
tant measure passed since 1913 in
which Democratic Congressmen have
not felt the heavy hand of the execu
tive." said the Senator. "Those Sen
ators who see an evasion of State
rights and a menace to the passage of
the present bill, ignore the graver vio
lations of the constitution exhibited
every day during this session."
Senator Robinson asked Senator
Cummins to be more specific in his
complaints, but the Senator from lowa
declared he had taken up the sub
ject only because Senator Hardwick
had previously asserted that President
Wilson had violated his conception of
the constitution in urging this legis
lation.

The Russians have won a great vic

opening up a breach 15 miles wide in
the Austro-German lines east and
southwest of Stanislau.
Following up this success, the Rus
sian cavalry has pushed across the
Manislau-Kolouiea railway and ac
cording to l'ctrograd is pursuing the
Teutons to the southwest of that line.

The Russians in their drive captured
the town of Tlumach which brings
them within 18 miles of Stanislau, an
important railway Junction on the
main line to Lembcrg and about 70
miles southeast ol" the Galician capital.
Berlin in to-day's official statement

front to previously prepared positions.
Ottynia is on the main line railway
15 miles southwest of Tlumach.

Allies Win on Somme
Both at Verdun and on the Somme
front in Northern France the oppos

Verdun seems for the time being to
rest with the Germans, while along
the Somme the entente forces appear
the decided gainers.
Paris to-day reports the success of
an operation conducted in conjunc
tion with the British north of the
Somme. While General Haig's forces
were attacking at Guillemont, the
French advanced east of Hill 139,
north of Hardecourt.
