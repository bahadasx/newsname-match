STACOMA MOTHER HUNTS HER "LITTLE GIRL" HERE
HIGH SCHOOL
LASS IS SEEN
WITH A HAN
Today the police beat brought a story to me.
A little brown-haired woman came into the office
ud told me the had been sent by Blanche Mason,
superintendent of the women's division of the police
department, to ask my help. 1 am going to tell the
story she told me.
The little brown-haired woman's name is Mrs. Laura
F. Harrison, and her home is in Tacoma. Her blue eyes
are tired and shot with tiny, red veins from much,
weeping. All the while she talked to me she sat with
her hands clenched tight together, and only kept her
lips from quivering by the sheerest strength of will.
Only a little over a month ago she was at home
at 1407 North Anderson st. in Tacoma, with her 14-
year-old son and her 16-year-old daughter Antha. Now
the boy is alone at home. The mother is here with red
veins in her eyes and a horrible fear in her heart, seek
in* night and day for Antha.
Antha finished her fre*hman
year In high school In June, and
the three of theoi have had a happy
-mmer together.

On the Fourth of July Mr* Har

excitement. That night, about *
o'clock, ahe telephoned her mother
that (he had returned, but that she
wanted to go to the Stadium with
her little brother,
"And I Scolded Her"
Here In her atory Mrs. Harrison
broke down.
"And I ■coldest her." she sobbed
"I scolded her because she had
been out all afternoon and wanted
to go out again The last words I
said to her were crow words."

• STRAW THAT SHOWS
THE WAY WIND BLOWS
A straw that shows which way the wind blows is the
poll of the Seattle city council on the senatorial situation.
NOT ONE OF THE CITY DADS IS WILLING TO
COME TO THE FRONT FOR WILLIAM E. HUM
PHREY, CONGRESSMAN.
FOUR COUNCILMEN, ON THE OTHER HAND.
ARE PROUD TO PROCLAIM THEMSELVES FOR
SENATOR MILES POINDEXTER.
The facts speak for themselves—and the whole city of Seattle
speaks just as eloquently for the fearless, independent, honest senator.
Seattle does not want Humphrey, the discredited.
Just as in 1910, Seattle will tnve Miles Poindexter the tremendous
majority he deserves for services well rendered, tor duty scrupulously ob
served. for faithfulness to the people.
Vdu remember that in 1910 there were the professional politicians
who have eyes but see not, who refused to observe the handwriting
on the wall. I hey met in convention and read Poindexter out of the
party. But Poindexter swept the state from end to end by the biggest
majorities ever given a candidate at that time.
History repeats itself. The professional politicians and would-be
bosses do not want Poindexter. Hut the people are rallying to
him. Seattle's city councilmen are sensitive to public opinion and
can feel the pulse of the people.
They reflect the overwhelming sentiment of the city—
and the state for Sen. Miles Poindexter.
Seattle, disgusted at Humphrey's postoffice "duck
pond," shocked at his lack of proper co-operation with Sen-
Poindexter on the Bremerton navy yard bill, ashamed of
his attempt to grab $1,200 fr>m the United States treasury
for fake traveling expenses, is going to roll up a majority
for Poindexter even greater than the 1910 record.

Promise of criminal prosecution of person* respon
sible for the use of county automobiles in the Lafe Ham
ilton political excursion to Enumclaw Saturday and the
collection of fares from persons taken along, and
astounding disclosure that taxpayers are annually paying
$17,000 for gas, tires and repairs for 24 privately-owned
cars, were developments which stirred the courthouse
Tuesday.
Deputy Prosecutor Helsell had a long conference
with Mrs. Wilda Hamilton, of Vashon Island, who frj
one of the passengers who paid $1 to ride in a county 4
car to the Enumclaw picnic.
Following this, Helsell declared he had been in
structed by Prosecutor Lundin, who left Tuesday foi
North Yakima, to bring in all the chauffeurs who drove
cars to the picnic, give them a thoro quizzing, and to use
the information thus obtained to prosecute the "pro
moters" of the excursion.
Helsell said he did not know exactly what charge
would be laid against the offenders.
"There are several statutes that seem to cover the
case," he said.
Carrigan Calls It Robbery
"It was clearly a Lafe Hamilton project," de
clared County Commissioner Carrigan. "They
used the taxpayers' money to transport passengers,
collected $1 from everybody who rode and turned
the money into the coffers of the South End Re
publican club to be used for the benefit of candi
dates. I have never seen such a high-handed raid."
ON TOP OF THIS, IT WAS LEARNED FROM

KING COUNTY DOES NOT OWN 47 CARS—
ONLY 23, THE RECORD SHOWS.
THE OTHER 24 ARE PRIVATELY OWNED.
They are used partially for Kins
county work by their owners, who
receive a salary from the county.
The theory under which the
county maintain* these 24 cars Is
that It Is fair to the owner. If be

tip's and repairs free.
Used for Private Pleasure
But the cars are used, for the
most part, not tor county work,
but for private business and pleas
ure.
I'ndcr the present system of
bookkeeping, tt Is impossible for the
county auditor to know how much
gas any one rar uses.
When a quantity of gas is pur
chased. its cost is divided by 47.
Thus the Ford car used by the
county school superintendent is
charged with as* much gas as the
bin Packard used by the sheriff's
office
Twenty for Commissioners
Twenty cars are charged to the
county commissioners. Commis
sioner Carrigan lias none. The
cost of maintaining these for the
past five months was f11,128.67.
The county engineer has four
cars, maintainel for a like period
at a cost of 11,818.56.
Sheriff Hodge's four cars cost
$2.241.03 to maintain five months.
For the same period the follow

Added to this Is the cost of main

$6.:>47.76.
All privately o«ned car* are

lty simple arithmetic it may be
ascertained that the cost of matn
