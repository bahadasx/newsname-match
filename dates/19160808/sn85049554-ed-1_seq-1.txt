Marine observers who picket the

figured that if the Bremen was one of
the submersibles picked up at Cross
Island yesterday, she ought to turn
Cape Ann this afternoon. She could
hug the coast from Cross Island down
and have all the water she needed with

New York is coincident with another
big increase in the epidemic of infantile
paralysis. Only once since the plague
got its ftart were there more cases
thanfeported today. During the twen

of the disease in the greater city and
183 new cases were reported.
There were twenty-eight deaths and.
eighty-nine cases in the borough
Brooklyn, while in Manhattan
marked increase both in fatalities ana
new cases was shown. Since the epi
demic began on June 26 there have
been 5,347 cases, and 1,196 deaths.
of
Altho the humidity was lower this
city was plunged into anothef heat
wave here today. At 10 o'clock the
temperature was 83, as against 77 yes
terday. The humidity was 80, com
pared with 93 at the same hour yester
day. That this would probably be the
hottest day of the year was indicated
by a rise of three degrees in tempera
ture between 9 and 10. There have
been five deaths and nineteen prostra
tions from heat in the last twenty-four
hours.
Convalescents Offer Blood,
Twelve persons who have recovered
from attacks of infantile paralysis
have volunteered to give a quantity of
their blood to be used in serum for
the treatment of the disease. Sufficient
blood was taken from two of the vol
unteers* to treat nine cases. The health
commissioner again appeals- to physi
cians to co-operate in causing the col
lection of as much of the serum
possible. Commissioner Emerson gftiff
that forty patients-^fave^b'een treated
with the serum from immunefi*ubjeot»
and 'the results had been so 'tetlsfao
tory that he would continue. He 4e
clared the physicians are not yet In a
position to say that they can prove the
serum's curative value.
Homes of Wealth Invaded.
Richard T. Crane, Jr., the Chicago
manufacturer, telegraphed Mayor
Mitchel last night that he will give
$25,000 to the physician who can offer
the best cure or preventive for lnfan
tile paralysis? in the next year. A ma
jority vote of the American Medicil
Association is to decide who is to re
ceive the reward.
A spread of the disease to the chil
dren of wealthy New Yorkers in tho
suburbs is one of the latest develop
ments. Three children of one wealthy
man with a summer home on Oyster
Bay have the disease.
Congress Votes Money.
Washington, Aug. 8.—An act ap
propriating )8a,000 for the use of the
public health service in preventing thfr
spread of disease and |50t000 for addi
tional assistant surgeons was signed
today by President Wilson. The money
is available Immediately and will bt
used in the campaign to check the in
fantile paralysis epidemic.
Strengthening of the force was
deemed necessary partly from the ac
tion of the Pennsylvania authorities
declaring a quarantine against the dis
ease.
Health officers say the $50,000 addi
tional for assistant surgeons will pro
vide about twenty-two more men.

to .the president.
Senator Thomas of Colorado, chair
man of the senate woman suffrage

this session of congress, because lt
could not be done without precipitating
prolonged debate.
"I recently addressed a letter to
each senator," said Senator Thomas,
"asking whether he would consent
to the taking up of this amendment
and submitting it to a vote without
argument. The responses I received

MEXICO WILLING
TO YIELD POINT
Has No Objection to Discussion of all
Disputes With United States but
Prefers to Dispose of Border Con
troversy First—Way Paved for Ap
pointment of Commission.
Washington, Aug. 8.—The adminis
tration has decided to agree to Gen
eral Carranza's suggestion for the dis
cussion of points of differences by a
commission of six members and will
proceed at once to the selection of
three American representatives. This
will be done on the understanding that
after the points suggested by Carranza
are disposed o'f other questions will be
taken up.
Washington, Aug. 8.—-The Carranza
government wants to take up the bor
der situation first by the proposed
joint international commission, but is
willing tjbat other matters be discuss
ed later.? Elisec Arrendondo so out
lined the Mexican situation today to
Acting- Secretary Polk, who took the
information to the cabinet meeting.
It was. Indicated that state depart
ment officials were satisfied with the
situation^.-, and the appointment of
American commissioners might be ex
pected any time.
Mr. Arredondo assured Secretary
Polk that General Carranza's state
ment that the commissioners prefer
abl would discuss the subjects outlined
in the proposal merely meant that
prefererence would be given to the
border situation, but that other ques
tions Wftuld not be excluded.
He said- he regarded the last CaV
ranza note one of complete compliance
to the American suggestions.
The ambassarod's call was believed
to have cleared away the last ob
stacle to appointment of the American
commissioners and a decision as to the
time and place of conferences. Gen
eral Carranza already had authorized
Mr. Arredondo to arrange details with
Mr. Polk.

mentioned particularly Mr. Hughes'
speech accepting the repub

gress by Senator Fall and Represen
tative Rodenberg.

would reflect the blood of noble sons."

TO CONFER WITH
MEN AND MANAGERS
President Wilson to Take No Action
Unless All Other Efforts at Mediation
Fail—Vote Nearly Canvassed and
Shows Employes of Roads Are Al
most Unanimous in Favor of Strike—
Traffic Being Resumed in New York.
New York, Aug. 8.—A decision as to
whether 400,000 employes of 235 rail
road systems in the United States
shall go on strike to enforce their de
ma/ids for an eight hour day and pay
at the rate of time and one-half for
overtime, is expected to result from a
conference of the national conference
committee on railroads- with the heads
of the great railroad brotherhoods,
which was resumed here today.
In a series of conferences J
earlier in the summer the rai'
managers rejected most of the
mands of the men and proposed
arbitrate their differences in accord
ance with the Xewlands act.
Since then the men have taken a
vote on the strike question. While
the resist of this vote lias not been of
ficially announced, it has been stated
that the great majority of men voted
to strike if necessary. As was ex

agers' conference showed that the em
ployes were overwhelmingly in favor
of authorizing a strike.

senting the roads, while the men are
represented by W. S. Stone, grand
chief of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers W. G. Lee head of the
trainmen's organization W. G. Gar
rettson, head of the Order of Railroad

would ask a delay of several days to
consider-'the proposals of the men
aiic} that another meeting will be held
later' in the week, when the final
anjver. will be given.
The' possibility of a strike is re
garded by the business interests of
the country as grave, and much pres
sure has been brought to bear on both
the roads and the men to effect some
settlement of the difficulties.
Vote Almost Unanimous.
Soon after the figures were made
public the conference adjourned until
tomorrow. Each union head presented
his figures in different form. W. S.
Stone, for the engineers, reported 98.17
per cent in favor of a strike in the
southeastern district 90.35 in the west

enginemen. reported that out of a total
of 70,653 votes cast, Including non
ulon men and employes of roads not
represented in the conference, 98.04 per
cent were in favor of a strike.
W. G. Lee, for the trainmen, reported
that of a total vote of 129.10S, 124,833
favored a strike, with 1,400 votes still
to be heard from.
A. B. Garrettson, of the conductors,
reported 84.03 per cent affirmative in
the western district, 84.08 in the east
ern, and 93.04 in the southern district,

bers of the United States board of me
diation and conciliation, arranged to
day to go to Ne\v York tonight to get
in touch with the threatened, railroad

there by Judge Martin J. Knapp, chair
man of the board. The board has not
yet received an Invitation from either
side to mediate in the controversy and
under the law can not offer its services
until a tie-up in traffic is Imminent.
But the members believe their services
will be required and want to discuss
the situation with the representatives
of the railroads and their employes.
Secretary Wilson, of the department
of labor, has made several reports to
the president. The president will take
no action personally unless -all other
agencies fall to avert a break.

car lines in Manhattan and the Bronx

Iowa Senator Charges Pres

HEAVY HAND FELT
ON EVERT MEASURE
President Alleged to Be Grave Violator
of Constitution—^Senile Agrees to
Conference Report on Army Appropri
ation Bill—Wilson Urges House to
Accept Senate Provisions For Larger
Naval Building Program.
Washington, Aug. 8.—Senator Cum
mins today charged President Wilson
with forcing democrats in the house
to adopt legislation against their own
opinions.
"There has not been a single im
portant measure passed since 1913 In
which democratic congressmen have
not felt the heavy hand of the execu
tive,", he said. "Those senators who
see a menace of state rights in the
passage of the child labor bill ignore
the graver violations of the constitu
tion exhibited every day during this
session."
Senator Robblns asked Senator Cum
mins to be more specific, but the Iowa
senator said he had taken up the sub
ject only because Senator Hardwick
had asserted that Presidont Wilson
had violated his powers in urging this
measure.
8enate Agrees to Army Bill.
Without debate the senate today
agreed to the conference report on the
army appropriation bill, carrying $275,
595,000 for maintenance of the reor
ganized regular army and the national
guard.
The only criticism of the report
came from Senator Clapp, who pro
tested against the elimination of the
LaFoIlette amendment Increasing th
minimum age limit for onllstment from
18 to 21 years without consent of par
ents or guardian.
The bill provides for organization of
a council for national defense to co
ordinate transportation, Industrial and
agricultural facilities In time of stress,
for relief of dependent families of men
in service, and appropriates a sum
of more than $13,000,000 for develop
ment of aviation in the army.
Urges Senate Program.
President Wilson summoned Senator
Swanson and Representative Padgett,
representing the senate and house con
ferees on the naval bill, to the White
House today, to urge that the house
accept the senate provisions for a
langer building program. The presi
dent was told of the failure of the con
ferees yesterday to reach an agree
ment on these two features and was
informed that a vote on the conference
report would be taken In the house
next Tuesday.
