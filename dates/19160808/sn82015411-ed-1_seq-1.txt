WRAMP-GARDNER
The wedding bells rang joyously
on Saturday evening last, at Wahi
awa, at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
William Kruse, when their grand
daughter, Miss Helen A. Gardner,
was married to Mr. George C. W.
Wramp, ' Kekaha, by Rev. J. M.
Lydgate, in the midst of a large cir
cle of relatives and intimate friends.
The bride, who is an attractive girl,
was simply but prettily dressed after
the manner of brides, and the ser
vice was more than usually impres
sive, with that happy combination uf
genuine emotion which runs to
smiles one moment and to tears
another. The ceremony was im
mediately followed by a wedijing
supper, where the rare delicacies of
the old-time German cooking were
most heartily enjoyed. It was a hap
py occasion all round, but most so
for the genial and hearty hosts, Mr.
?and Mrs
Kruse.
Candidates For Senate
Political runiorologists have it that
Hon. J. 11. Coney will be a Republi
can candidate in the primary for the
Senate and that he will probably
not be opposed in his party. The
seat to become vacant is that of
Senator Chas. A. Rice whoso term
expires this year.
John T. Chandler, of Koloa, will
be a candidate for nomination on the
Democratic ticket and will likely
not be opposed in the primary.
A Honolulu Visitor
Miss GerlrudeMcQueen, of Hono
lulu, returned to the city Saturday
night after a visit of three weeks
w i t h the Roendahls, at Eleele.
While on the island a dance was
given in her honor in Eleelo hall,
and Friday evening Miss llolyn
Schimmolfenig, of Koloa, gave her
a complimentary luau, which was;
largely attended and much enjoyed.

Last week ear 44(5, from Ilanalei,
driven by a Japanese, ran into a
big truck belonging to MoBryde
Store on the Eleele side of the Wa
hiawa hill, smashing up things
generally. The car. a new Buick,

tained $100 of injury. Witnesses

the case) on the wrong side of the
road .

hue, on the Kapaia side, will be
constructed a house for the use of
persons having business establish
ments in the building. It will be a

yesterday for the marriage of Paul
iO. E. Rutsch and Miss H. Ainalie
Grote, both of Lihue.
L
ALL OVER SUNDAY
I Here was hasohall all over on
cuniiay nut as a rule it was oi a
rather one-sided quality, indicating
n . i i i t i
that the teams are unevenly balanc
ed. Games were played at Kilauea,
Lihue, Eleele and Makaweli. Th
fifth game, billed for Homesteads
failed to materialize because Com
pany F, of Kealia, did not show up
. THE GAME AT KIL.W'EA
The tightest game of the day was
that between Company 15, of Lihue,
and Company D, of Kilauea, at Ki
lauea. Lieutenant Patterson went
over m charge ot the l.iluio bunch
and Scares was put in the box. Quit
a crowd witnessed the contest. At
the ninth innings the score was a
tie. !5 to o. Company 15 at that
point made a big pull-up, however,
putting seven men across the plate.
The game closed 10 to !! in favor of
the visitors. -
LI III' E GAME A FIZZLE
The game at Lihue between Com
panies A and C was considerable of
a frost. Only four innings were act
ually finished, when Company C
(Filipinos) left the Held. The score
at the time was .'54 to 4 in favor of
Company A. Both teams complain
ed that some of their best men were
absent.
ON ELEELE FIELD
A fair-sized crowd turned out at
Eleele to witness the game between
Company G, of that town, and Com
pany E, of Kealia. This proved to
be a very one-sided contest, Com
pany G scoring 1!) runs and letting
their competitors in for only one.
MAKAWELl'S HOME GAME
Companies I and K had a game at
Makaweli Sunday afternoon, the
score heme to in lavor ot the
former. The crowd was small. Coin-:
panics L and K will play at the
same place next Sunday.
New Club Quarters
An extensive addition is being
built on Mifrrison Hall, at Maka
weli, which will lie u.-ed for a
hoarding house and club quarters
for the employees of the plantation.
When completed It will take tl o
place of the piesont boarding house,
and will he more roomy and more
elaborately littcd up.
Steam Roller Burns Cane
Last Tuesday afternoon a county
team roller, working on the public
highway, set lire to a patch of
young cane at Homestead belong
ing to A. .1. Caldeira and practically
destroyed two acres of it. An effort
will be made to grind some of it,
but as the cane was, so young the
saving will be small.
Koloa's Dividends
With its extra dividends to be
paid out added to the regular divi
dends already provided for, Koloa
Sugar Company will dispense thirty
per cent to its stockholders tlijs year.
This is regarded as a remarkable
showing for an estate which a short
time ago was almost in the "lame
duck" class.
Tax Appeal Decisions
Decisions in the Makaweli, Gay &
Robinson and McBryde Sugar Com
pany tax appeal cases will probably
be handed down by the Tax Appeal
court tomorrow.

"come back".
