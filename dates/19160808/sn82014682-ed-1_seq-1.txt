This was shown last night when the

Reserve Supplies, Equipment,
For All Army Posts Here
to Be Stored For Use
A group of big army reserve store
houses, costing $127,000, located at
Fort' Shatter and serving to centralize
distribution of equipment-and sup
plies to every army pott in the Ha
waiian department, will be built at
once.
Authorization to spend this large
sum of money was received today in
a letter from the war department to
Capt David L. Stone, constructing
quartermaster, notifying him that
funds are now available and directing
him: to proceed at once with the
preparation of plans and specifica
tions for the work and to advertise
for bids as soon as practicable.
In making public the news of this
appropriation for Oahu, Capt. Stone
widvthat he believes it is a part of
the sundry civil bill, which despatches
to the Star-Bulletin July 29 said had
become a law July 1. Nothing was
said! in the letter concerning appro
priations in the bill which if they
were passed will ... provide for "new
buildings and other military work on
Oahu costing $2,077,000.;
The reserve storehouses1, will ; be
erected on the Fort Shatter reserva
tion and will be of galvanized iron;
with 'concrete walls aud floors. They
will be, reached by a switch: and spur
tracks from the' Oahu Railway, which
passes t'j resenratioA to the Bouth. -v
i Considerable excavation will have
to be done to provide level sites on
the rocky hillsides where the store
houses, will be built. AH army equip
ment will be stored in the structures,
which will house reserve material suf
ficient for all army posts on this
island. Equipment arriving on army
transports will be placed on freight
cars and hauled to the storehouses,
and outgoing supplies can be han
dled by rail or motor truck with a
much shorter haul than If stored here.
The new ( storehouses will make It
unnecessary to continue storing array
supplies in half a dozen places in
Honolulu, Including rented structures,
and the old naval warehouse.- They
will centralize the storing and distri
bution ' of equipment ana supplies
much more efficiently than has
hitherto'been possible.
Cohstructlon of the storehouses was
discussed , several' years ago by the
war department, but lately nothing
had been said of thnn and the news
that they are to be built came today
as a surprise to the constructing quar
termaster's office.
