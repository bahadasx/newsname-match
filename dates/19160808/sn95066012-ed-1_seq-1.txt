TREE SUPERVISION
Method That Has Been Found To Se
cure Best Results.
There is no feature of landscape
irdcnliig and civic improvement
work which, in the I'nited Slates, bas
been neglected as much as the care of
tree-.'
This Is probably due to the c ompar
ative!) shott span of time which lias
elapsed since trers Were a nuisance to
settlers, and their removal to permit
tillage of the soil meant bard work.
It is true that the value of trees, in
our cities, has been recognised lor
ninny years Nevn i lieh-s-i. there is
still "in the blood." or In the habits of
the people a small remnant of the feel
ing (he builders of this country hail
for trees, ami an incilicicnt realization
f the Importance ol tree culture la sli
its phrases.
Witness the toleration, almost un
protected, of barnaroiis tree butchery
by public utility colorations, aiul tlm
lack of the most elementary euro of
beautiful old (tees In many of our
cii iei.
Beuuiiigtim is no exception. 1 am
told that just because they happened
to be in the way of a projected side
walk, a feW years ago, some of the
mo.-t beautiful trees of the village
Were mercilessly cm (iown, and that
at a spot where they are most needed,
party of tree Mirgcnus did good
work on a few trees in Bennington
last week, but us far as I could learn
the only work with which they hate
been Intrusted has been on trees
which were in Immediate danger of
breaking down. I'rnctlcally no on
Ventive work is being done.
In my opinion ami it is shared bv
every one who is laiuili.tr with tin
subject - conditions in Bennington
have drifted to such a point that pri
tntc Individuals would not be able to
ei pe with the situation satisfactorily.
The village ought to assume full aiith
orlly over all shade trees. Including
those on private property. The sag
nesib'ii sounds like ailvocjii ing tress
pass upon unalienable Individual
rights. However, that is the onlv wav
to protect the trees ol the village.
That Is the way Ijilopeao til it
have done things. Including Cltlei in
the most democratic of all countries
Switzerland. Ordinances to thai if
feci were found constitutional in other
Ainerban stales :md no doubt woul.l
be also In Vermont.
in many .mikiihiii cities iiio es
pouse of the can' of trees Is assessed
upon the property benefited by the
work, ami It includes often the proper
ty i. ii a w hole block.
it is only iu that manner Hint not
only urgent live work may he doni
systematically and cheaply, and that
provetitnlH e measures may be work
cit out.
Several times. I have beell asked
whether or not I would look over gar
dens ami ml vise property owners bow

Provided my time permits it. i win be
glad to do so this week. Upon rOQUOSl

the president and a democratic cam
paign slogan. "Vet wo seized Vera

war. And it was called war over the
bodii s of those dead soldiers; it was
called a win- of service.
"Talk about What is our policy.

any one know ? Has the executive ever
had a policy for morn than six months
on the .Mexican iniesllou. I tepcat.
who knows today what the policy
of the administration will be three

ble is that this administration lias
written such u record that no mat

whether it will stick to it.
"We have had an exhibition during
ine past laree years winch, i con
fess, fills me w ith adeep sense of

"I ought to say the proudest thing

But you can't have that pride If Amor

is not worthy of protection this whl

VOCATIONAL TRAINING
Bill Which
Senator Page
Has Long
Worked For
Washington, Aug.4. The vocation
al education bill which passed tho
senate the other day without debate
or notice of any kind, is to be pressed
UpOfl the house in an eleventh hour
attempt to secure enactment before
the adjournment of Congress. It bad
been thought that the senate calendar
Aas too crowded to allow room lor
this bill at this lime, and Ihe plan bad
been to postpone the enactment of this
legislation till the December session,
favorable reports on the bill were
made some weeks ago by both the
committees Which handled It.
According to advocates of legisla
tion of this character there Is a tre
mendous wastage of youth in the
l lilted States. With very lew ex
ceptions it may bo said that American
boys and girls leave school at the BgS
of It years, or earlier, and go to work.
At least 2,000,(00 boys and girls be
tween the ages of 14 and 16 are
winking for wages in this country, It
is pointed out that they are unskilled
at tiiat ago and unlit tor rcspnnsihil
ity. Kacb year U ,uuti young pooplt
are required simply to maintain tin
tanks of the American working popO
lotion. There are 14,000,000 persons IX
years and over in this country engaged
in farming, miniim. manufacturing,
ami mechanical pursuits trade and
transportation, of ihe 14,260,000 en
gaged In manufacturing and mechan
ical pursuits not one per cent have
had or nr the present time have any
chance to obtain mlcuuuto lndu-tri.il
training.
"If we assume.' said Congressman
Hughes, of QeorgiS, chairman of tie-
house committee on education ami
one of the authors of the bill, ' that
a system of vocational education pur
sued through years ol the past would
have increased the wage earning cap
acity of one million of our youth to
the extent of ten cents a (lay. this
WOUld have made mi increase of
wages for this group of iL'.een.i1') a
ilny t7f0,OO0,000 a year with all t lint
this would mean to the wealth and
life of the nation. This Is a very mod
erate estimate ami the facts would
probably show a difference between
the enroling power of the vocationally
trained ami the vocationally untrained
of cents a day. This would Indicate
a Witsle of wages through lack of
training Of (!,"fin.miil every day or
l7. for the year. This Is
difficult for us to conceive and be
lieve, hut these figures are true."
Tho bill as reported to both bran
ches of Congress and as passed by the
senate provides:
first. National giants tn be given

,it s o'clock at Clark's Woods.
There will be no admission charged
and the general public wilt be admit
ted free. A cordial Invitation Is ex
tended to the public and all are urged
to take advantage of this opportunity.
This performance Is made possible by
mouthers of the community who
wished to have the public as their
is iit this dramatic triumph.
The evening was chosen for the per
formance because of the belief that
the voices of the members of the cast
carry belter at that time and further
more because the night makes drama
tic effects possible that otherwise
would not be so.
"Julius Caesar", while sometimes
called ;i tragedy, is n melodrama und
has perhaps as wide an appeal as any
of Shakespeare's plays. The action is
rapid and varied, the dlologue simple
and upon the whole the play is per
fectl) adapted to presentation as a
( (immunity event.
