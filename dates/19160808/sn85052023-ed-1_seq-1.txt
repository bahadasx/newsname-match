Vote in Lincoln County Primary
TO GRAND JURY
WITHOUT BAIL
Commonwealth Makes Out Very Bad
Murder Case Against Slayer
of Renzo King.
Race for Congressional Nomination
In Eighth Proves Walkover for
Lincoln County Man.
The democratic race for Congress
in the Eighth district was really no
race. Congressman Harvey Helm
was renominated by the democrats
by over 5,500 majority over Senator
Charles F. Montgomery. Helm car
ried every county in the district ex
cept his opponent's home county of
Casey, and this only went 81 major
ity for Montgomery.
A very light vote was cast in the
democratic primary all over the dis
trict, probably about 50 per cent of
the normal vote. For several weeks
it had been apparent that Montgom
ery had no chance, and in most of
the counties of the district his
friends made no efforts whatever,
having neither money nor organiza
tion, with both of which his opposi
tion was well provided. Lincoln
county was probably the only coun
ty of the district in which a vote
near normal was polled, and this was
gressman Helm's friends were deter
largely due to the fact that Con
mined that he should carry his home
county by a large majority.
The election passed off quietly all
over the district. The result seems
to have been accepted in good spirit
by all, and those who were strongest
in their opposition to Helm before
the primary are now vieing with
each other in assurances of loyalty
and support for him and the entire
democratic ticket in November.
The majorities rolled up by Helm
in the counties of the Eighth dis
trict, are unofficially as follows:
Lincoln t 880
Adair 210
Boyle 654
Mercer 550
Shelby 10 1 5
Spencer . 375
Garrard 420
Jessamine 375
Madison 870
Anderson 605
Helm Should Go Higher, Says
Advocate.
The DanvHe Advocate, which has
been a consistent opponent of Con
gressman Helm for several years, in
its issue Monday had this of interest
in connection with his victory:
"Congressman Harvey Helm de
feated Charles F. Montgomery in the
primary for the Democratic nomina
tion for Congress last Saturday by
a majority of 5,671 votes. Helm
carried every county in the district
save Casey, the home county of
Montgomery. Congressman Helm is
a general favorite among the people,
and his friends say that he should
make the race for United States Sen
ator or Governor. As a campaigner
he has few equals in the Common
wealth. It goes without saying that
he can stay in Congress as long as he
wishes. He will be renominated next
time without opposition. We do not
believe that there is a man in the
Eighth district who will ever again
tackle him. The Advocate is for
Helm henceforth, as on two acca
sions the voters have shown that
they are for hivn by an overwhelming
majortiy. Senator Montgomery is
one of the best Democrats in the
district. He is a high-toned gentle
man. He has been the dry leader in
two legislatures and has the good
will of the dry people who compose
a large majority of the voters of this
district, but even with that strength
he could make no headway. A very
large number of democrats are free
ly expressing themselves that Helm
is too big a man for Congress and
that he snould be elevated to some
higher field of usefulness."
SOME ELECTION NOTES
A woman has been nominated by
the democrats of the First congres
ional district of Kansas, for con
gress. The race for the republican nom
ination for Judge of the Court of
Appeals in the Seventh or mountain
district, is close between Judge
Flem D. Sampson, of Barbourville,
and Judge A. J. Kirk, of Pike coun
ty, with the chances seem to be fa
voring Kirk. Several other leading
republicans of the mountains were
also rans. The district is overwhel
mingly republican.
The former Bull Moosers obtain
ed control of the republican organi
zation in Louisville by nominating
W. C. Owens for congress overDr.
Ryans and Dr. Bruner. Owens, who
made the famous race as a democrat
against W. C. P. Breckinridge years
ago, will be the republican nominee
against Swager Sherley and seems
to have no chance to win in the final.
Vice President Marshall will prob
ably make the chief address at the
opening of the democratic state cam
paign in Winchester, Sept. 9 th.
Congressman Campbell Cantrill
was renominated by the democrats
of the 7th district over R. E. L.
Murphy, a young Lexington lawyer
and formerly of Garrard county, by
8,000 majority.
W. J. Fields, congressman from
the 9th. was renominated over
Judge John W. Riley of Rowan coun
ty by a big majority.
John P. Haswell, won the republi
can nomination for congress in the
4th district and George P. Thomas
in the 1st. The rads have nominees
in every congressional district this
year,a and seem to think they have
a chance to carry Kentucky.

Jealousy of G. O. P. Leaders In
Other Counties Causes Defeat of
Life Long Party Worker.
One of the surprises of the pri
mary election, Saturday, if there
were many, was the defeat of Dr. R.
L. Davison, of this city, for the re
publican nomination for congress in
this districe. Returns from the re
publican primary were hard to get
hold of, and the vote was very
light. The republican voters have
not yet gotten fully acquainted with
the primary system of making nomi
nations. Incomplete returns from all of the
counties of the Eighth district in
dicate that L. Tom Neat, of Adair
county, defeated Dr. Davison by sev
eral hundred majority. The fact that
Dr. Davison and his friends in the
Eighth district were among the first
to get into the Hughes bandwagon
lead many to expect that the Hughes
machine in the district headed by
Ludlow Petty, of Shelbyville, would
"put it over" for Davison. Petty did
carry his home county of Shelby for
Davison but only a couple, of hun
dred republican votes were cast in
Shelby, and Neat went to Shelby and
Spencer county with something like
1,000 majority when the returns be
gan coming in.
Republican leaders over the dis
trict who were undoubtedly jealous
of the prominence of Dr. Davison
and his friends have taken in affairs
of the G. O. P. in the district, went
after Davison with keen edged knife
and slipped it into his ribs, "good
and proper." Perhaps they think
they can win with Neat in Nov
ember, but that's another story. Dr.
Davison and his friends are not apt
to forget for many moons the man
ner in which his long and faithful
service in fighting the battles of his
party against tremendous odds, has
been rewarded.
Dr. Davison carried his home
county here by 550 majority while
his opponent carried his home county
of Adair by 660. The Wiseman
Butler machine rolled up a big maj
ority against Davison in Boyle,
while the Lincoln county man car
ried Garrard, where he was expected
to un strong by only a few votes.
The full vote in this race will have
to be given later, as figures in it,
while conclusive as to the result
are unofficial and scarce.

Chautauqua at Hustonville the last
of this week and buy season tickets.
A great many here have already done
so. This is one of the greatest en
entertainments this community has
been able to offer its people for
many years and every one should
help out and make it a splndid suc
cess in every way.
The meeting at the Methodist
church closed last Thursday evening.
It was conducted by Rev. Clark, of
Richmond. Good crowds attended

E. Carter, of Rowland.

West End Folks Will Have Privilege
Of Attending Delightful Enter
tainments at Hustonville
The promoters have everything ar
ranged for a most delightful series
of entertainments at the Hustonville
Chautauqua the latter part of this
week and the first of next. Indica
tions now are that big crowds will be
present each day. A most attractive
program has been arranged and in
addition to the regular list of enter
tainments sent out by the Radcliffe
bureau a splendid list of speakers for
the morning lectures have been se
cured. On Friday, August 11th, the open
ing day of Chautauqua, Hon Mat S.
Cohen, State Commissioner of Agri
culture will address the Chautauqua
on one of the most interesting sub
jects of the day. All farmers and
tihose interested in agriculture in
any form should and doubtless will
be present. Friday will be known
as Agricultural Day.
Saturday, August 12th will be
designated as Educational Day. The
committee has been most fortunate
in securing Dr. R. H. Crossfield, the
president of Transylvania University
at Lexington, as the speaker for this
day. Dr. Crossfield is an orator of
rare ability and needs no introduc
tion to a Lincoln county audience.
The bare announcement that he will
speak will suffice to insure a large
attendance.
Monday, August 14th is Health
Day. The morning address will be
delivered by Surgeon John McMul
len, a member of the U. S. Health
Service, who is now stationed at Lex
ington, in charge of the trachoma
hospital. He has been detailed by
that department to lecture at Hus
tonville Chautauqua. Dr. McMullen
is a splendid speaker and lecturer.
His subject will embrace several top
ics pertaining to good health. This
will be an interesting and instructive
lecture.
These three lectures are free to all
who will come, and the public gen
erally is urged to be present.
On Sunday forenoon at 11 o'clock
union church services will be held in
the Chautauqua tent. The Chautau
qua director, a noted minister of the
gospel, will address the public. "Ev
eryone is cordially invited to be pre
sent on this delightful occasion. The
full program of entertainments dur
ing the Chautauqua at Hustonville,
is as follows:

their parents. Dexterity, mystery,
and humor make up their fascinating
program.
Ellsworth Plumstead. The inimi
table impersonator, in his mission of
mirth .Changing -at will- from -the
awkward age of "my sister's feller's
best girl's brother" to the aged Ezra

for good.

ment, as soloist or in company with
chese other artists will add a de-
I lightf ul feature to the concerts.

The Lyric Glee Club. Four great
voices in ensemble, sketches, solos,
duets and trios. These fine young
men excel in all the arts of enter
tainment that brings wholesome
happiness. In "Fun in an old-fashioned
school" they recall the half
forgotten days with the funny pranks
the odd mistakes and the laughable
situations.
Col. George A. Gearhart. One of
the sanest and manliest of men. His
popular lectures for the past twenty
years in churches, colleges and uni
versities have stimulated thousands.
Listening to him you rejoice that
steadiness of aim, thoroughness of
thinking and power of eloquence are
still with us.
Preachers Admitted Free.
The directors of the Knights of
Pythias Fair, which will be held at
Stanford, August 23, 24, 25, at a
meeting Saturday decided to admit
free all ordained preachers, of Lin
coln county. A cordial invitation is
extended these gentleman and it is
hoped that each and every one of
them will be on hand each day.
JSvery attention possible will be ex
tended to them.
Miss Ashby Isaacs, daughter of
Alfred Isaacs, merchant at Gravel
Switch, shot herself in the breast at
the home of her parents Monday
evening, inflicting a wound which
may prove fatal. Miss Isaacs is 16
years old. It could not be learned
why she shot herself. It is said,
however, that she had been asked by
her parents to give up some of her
boy friends.
The Best Laxative.
To keep the bovels regular the
best laxative is outdoor exercise.
Dring a full glass .of water half an
hour before breakfast and eat an

John Baker was held to await the
action of the Lincoln county grand
jury without bail at his examining
before Judge Bailey in the county
court here Tuesday morning, on a
charge of murdering Renzo King at
Moreland, Sunday, August 2d.
According to all the evidence in
troduced by the commonwealth, the
killing was one of the most "cold
blooded" murders committed in Lin
coln county in many years. The tes
timony of Baker's own brother, Wm.
Baker seemed sufficient to send the
accused to the electric chair. And
it was corroborated in every essen
tial detail by the testimony of Levi
Kelly, who was the only other eye
witness to the tragedy.
According to their testimony,
without the slightest provocation for
such an act, John Baker went to his
home, secured a big corn knife and
returning to where King, Kelly and
Wm. Baker were, without a word
other than a curse to King, split his
head open with the heavy blade.
According to these two witnesses,
there had been no previous trouble
between the two men. Kelly testi
fied that King and John Baker had
been "playing or scuffling" previous
to Che affair, but said that it was of
such a trifling and inconsequential
nature that he paid no attention to it
and thought nothing of it.
The defendant who was represent
ed by Attorney J. S. Owsley, did not
take the stand, and the common
wealth introduced only a few wit
nesses. A large crowd was present
and court had to be held in the cir
cuit court room upstairs, a great
deal of interest being manifested in
the case in the Wast End of the
county where Mr. King was so well
known and esteemed. His widow and
son, James King, and his brother-in-law,
Sheriff J. D. Taylor of Casey
county were preesnt at the examining
trial of his slayer. County Attorney
W. S. Burch conducted the case for
the prosecution.
James King, son of the murdered
man, was put on the stand first and
testified simply to the fact of his fa
ther's wounds and death. He has
been working in Cincinnati and was
there at the time of the tragedy.
Levi Kelly, one of the eye witness
es, was next put on the stand. He said
that Sunday morning, August 2, he
and Wm. Baker met Mr. King at his
barn door. John Baker came by and
all were laughing and talking. Wm.
Baker said something to King about
selling him a heifer, and they all de
cided to go down into the pasture
and look at her. Kelly said that on
the way down there King and John
Baker were playing and scuffling but
no one thought anything of it or
paid any attention to it. They look
ed at the heifer and John Baker went
home and then came back to where
the rest were. Kelly said he was sit
ting under a chestnut tree, King was
standing, a few feet away and Wm.
Baker was in the lane or roadway.
Kelly said when John Baker came
back, he (Kelly) just looked up as.
John Baker passed him and struck
at King with a corn knife. He said
that absolutely nothing had happen
ed before that. He said that King
and John Baker had been playing
and scuffling; not wrestling or fight
ing; and if either was mad he didn't
know it. Kelly said that he told
John Baker: "Don't do that," when
he saw that Baker was about to hit
King with the knife. He said that
before that while the two men had
been scuffling and playing that John
Baker had said to him, "Why don't
you make this man let me alone; I
don't like to be a playfng." Kelly
said that King wasn't mad and if
Baker was, he didn't know it. Kelly
said that after Baker had struck
King, he (Kelly) said to Baker "John
you have killed that man," and Bak
er replied "Yes, and you need one,
too." Kelly said that King didn't fsll
after he was struck and that he got
a handkerchief and tried to stop the
blood which was gushing from the
wound, and then he and Wm. Baker
tried to get him to a doctor. He said
that King was in his shirt sleeves and
had nothing in his hands when John
Baker struck him. Kelly was not
cross-examined by the-.defense.
Wm. Baker, brother of the accus
ed, told very much the same story as
Levi Kelly. He said he had heard no
words between John Baker and King.
He told of the trip they made to look
at his heifer in his mother's field.
John Baker came by and popped a
few minutes and then went to the
house and shortly afterward came
back. Wm. Baker said he was not
paying much attention to the other
men but heard Kelly say "Don't do
that, and then turned and saw John
Baker strike King with a corn knife.
Wm. Baker said he didn't see any
scuffling or playing. He said that
John Baker said "G d you" to
King before he struck him which
were the only words he heard from
anyone except Kelly, and that King
said nothing. Baker said he didn't
think there was anything out of the
ordinary between his brother and
King before that. Baker told prac
tically the same story as to other de
tails as Kelly had done and conclud
ed his testimony wrth the statement:
"I have no idea what was the cause
of it and saw no Teason for it." He
was not cross-examined.
Dr. M. L. Pipes told of the condi
tion he found King in when he was
called to. attend him. He said his
skull was badly fractoired and he
was unconscious.
Wm. Burkett told of talking with
John Baker after he had struck King.
He said he asked Baker what he cut
King for and he said he did it be
cause he squeezed him. He said that
Baker told him he hadn't been drink
ing and that he seemed sober to him.
He said Teddy Grubbs was present
when this conversation took place.
Lafe Ellis also told of a conversa
tion with John Baker, in the pre
sence of Bill Burgin. Ellis said that
Baker asked him to go to the doc -
tpr's office and see how badly King
was hurt. Ellis said Baker told him
that he had cut King. Ellis said he
went over and found out about the
condition of King and went back
and told Baker King was cut bad. He
said he asked Baker what came up to
cause it and Baker said: "Renzo come
up and grabbed me. I told him not
to do it, and he said 'John, you
know there's nothing in you,' and I
told him to wait till I could go up
to the house and I'd show him wheth-
Hotel, Livery Stable, Stoe and D. S.
Riffe's Residence Wiped Out by
Flames Sunday Night.
McKinney, eight miles southwest
of Stanford, and one of the most
thriving little communities on the
Q. & C. railroad, was visited by a
destructive conflagration about 10
o'clock Sunday night, which wiped
out the McKinney hotel, the McAn
inch livery stable, Masters & Bow
year's general merchandise store, and
the residence of D. S. "Kifft-. The
loss is a very heavy one, reaching in
to thousands of dollars. It is under
stood that the only insurance car
ried was $1,750 on the hotel build
ing carried by the Messrs. M'Aninch,
who bought it a short time ago from
Masters & Bowyer. The hotel was
being operated by George Lay and
wife.
The fire is reported to have start
ed in the livery stable, and to have
been caused by a lantern being over
turned near a barrel of gasoline.
This building was soon a mass of
flames, and as there is no water
works system or means of fire pro
tection in the town, the adjoining
buildings soon caught fire also, and
it was then just a question of how
well the scope of the fire could be
limited. Several buggies were burn
ed in the stable, but all the horses
were gotten out safely. A consid
erable amount of furniture was also
taken out of the hotel before the
flames licked it up, and Mr. Riffe
saved most of his furniture and
household effects.
G. H. Masters, who operates a liv
ery stable in Stanford and makes
this city his home now, was in bed,
when awakened by a phone call,
which briefly told him that his store
was afire. He jumped into his
clothes and broke many speed rec
ords in his car getting to the scene.
He and his partner, Mr. Bowyer had
planned to move their stock of goods
to Stanford at an early date and
open a store here, and had let insur
ance on the goods while in McKin
ney, expire, so that their loss is
probably a couple of thousand dol
lars. He says that he saved about
a third of the stock of the store.
This was brought to Stanford and
placed in the old State Bank store
room, where Mr. Masters will prob
ably open for business shortly.
The good people of McKinney
turned out en masse and did every
thing they could to save property
and prevent spread of the flames.
Had it not been for their hard work,
it is probable that the entire village
would have been wiped out.
Property of all kinds can alway3
be kept protected from destruction

surance Man, of Stanford in time.
