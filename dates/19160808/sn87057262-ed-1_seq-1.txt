WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.—President
Wilson will accept Mexico as the cam
paign issue if Republican Candidate
Hughes and his followers continue to
indicate they desire the fight for the
presidency waged on this question.
This was the declaration of those
close to the president today. Presi
dent Wilson has agreed to open the
democratic campaign around Septem
ber first, regardless of congress.
September two has been agreed upon
as the date for Wilson's notification,
but should it appear evident that con
gress will continue In session until
well Into September, the president
may make his speech of acceptance
the last week in August.
This rallying call for the democrats
is now practically completed. The
first draft has been made. It. will con
tain about four thousand words.
Senator OUie James, who will offi
cially notify the president of his re
nomination will emphasize the con
tention that "a united America stands
behind the president."
While Hughes' campaign tour may
develop nMPWErr dbartie* torn Urns
to time in the president's address, the
features,- which will be most strongly
put forth according to the present
draft, include:
"The policy of this country toward
-Mexico and the other South American
republics.
Plans for continuing industrial pre
paredness to meet the economic situa
tion facing the country after the war.
The course of the administration in
maintaining pestce.
A resume of the legislation offered
and passed by a democratic congress

it is expected to do in meeting the un

country.

T. T. Frankenburg of Columbus,

ten cents.
"Flour has advanced 70 percent in
two years and forty percent in the
last sixty days" said J. Burns of
Omaha, president of the convention.
"Ten cent loaves are the only salva

Candidate Hughes Was Fresh

[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
CHICAGO, Aug. 8.—Charles Evans
Hughes is out-Roosevelting Roosevelt
in strenuosity in campaigning. Ar
riving here today, the republican
nominee was fresh as a daisy after
a day in Detroit that kept him on
the jump, in fiercely hot weather,
from early morning to late at night,
inclu4ed six speeches and a break
neck bit of auto speeding around the
town. Moreover, Hughes seemed
likely today to achieve a new record
in Chicago for stumpers.
Only one speech was scheduled—at
the Coliseum, where back in June
the G. O. P. selected him as its can
didate—but the nominee had to
straighten out a slightly tangled up
factional muss between republicans in
Illinois, was expected' to put the seal
of approval on a number of cam
paign measures for the westepi fight
formulated by National Chairman
Wlllcox and it seemed likely he would
have a good deal of handshaking to
do.
He was slated for a conference with
Chairman William R. Willcox, Alvln
T. Hert of Kentucky, western cam
paign manager and national commit
teeman. At noon he was to hold an
open handshaking reception in the
rotunda of a loop skyscraper. This
afternoon he will be taken for an
auto tour of Chicago's boulevard sys
tem. Tonight he will address a mass
meeting at the Coliseum.
Mrs. Fred Upham, wife of the Illi
nois national committeeman, formed
the head of a party of women who
greeted Mrs. Hughes. The candidate's
wife will have a busy day, too.
Only just started in his campaign
ing for the highest office in the land.
Hughes today had already developed
an almost Rooseveltian vocabulary of
denunciation and of aphorism. Some
of his epigrams coined so far are:
"The democratic party is a party
for votes only."
"The democratic party came up to
the protection tax like a skittish
horse approaching a brass band."
"We are entitled to a standing
army, without taking men out of civil
life, as in the Mexican mobilisation,
just as much as a city is entitled to
proper police protection.'
"The military problem is a problem
of good sense."
"There's no danger of our going to
war unless the othfer side knows that
'we're too proud to fight'."
"The best way of making for effi
ciency is by making for content
ment."
It is a libel, ibis story that Hughi

BREAD TO STAY
AT FIVE CENTS
While Some Bakers Are Anxious to
Boost Price, Others See no Oc
casion for It.
NEW YORK, Aug. 8.—The in
creased cost of flour, lard and labor,
is given by New York bakers as ample
reason for either the reduction in
weight or the raising in price of the
ordinary five cent loaf of bread.
"Everything that is used in making
bread and the cost of labor as well,
has gone up," said C. B. Abbott, of
the Abbott bakeries. "The size of
the loaf must be reduced or the price
increased."

VERDICT IS DECISIVE
Little Prospect of Immediate Action
Even Though Situation
is Apparently Dead
locked.
INIEW YORK, Aug. 8.—Presidents of
the four railroad (brotherhoods and
representatives of the 225 railroads
effected by the railway employes' de
mands, met here today to listen to
the results of the so-oalled strike
.. .. vote, involving 400,000 men. It Is
!£l A generally known more than ninety
per cent of the men have voted to
strike unless the demands for an
eight hour basic day and time and
one-half for overtime are granted.
Representatives of both employers
and employes say there Is little pos
sibility of an immediate strike, even
though the situation is apparently
deadlocked. Although the'switchmen's
union of North America aslced for
help from the U. S., board of con
ciliation and mediation and have
agreed to submit their demands to
arbitration, officers of the four rail
way brotherhoods have not taken
kindly to any suggestions of govern
ment arbitration. Representatives of
the eanployes today declared the
men -were dissatisfied with the recent
awards of the arbitration boards and
not with the theory itself. The em
ployes have publicly announced op
position to the proposal that the in
terstate commerce commission in
vestigate the controversy. It Is con
tended the commission is not equip
ped to handle the situation and has
no power of settling wage disputes.
Almost Unanimous.
NEW YORK, Aug. 8.—About nine
ty-four per cent of the railway train
men affiliated with the four brother
hoods have voted in favor of a strike,
it was normally announced here to
day after the vote had ibeen tabulated.
The count represents the decision
of abont 400,000 railway employes of
225 roads with a mileage of about
350,000, or practically every line in
the United States. By an overwhelm
ing majority, members of the other
three employes' organizations rallied
to the support of the brakemen who
demanded an eight hour day and
time and one-half for over time.

LONDON, Aug. 8.—Threatened with
enforced retreat from the strong
Leipslg redoubt and the fortified vil
lage of Thlepval, the Germans are
making every effort to dislodge the
Australians from jnlll l&O, standing
600 feet above the Pozleres-Thiepval
highway.
A heavy bombardment ef this sec
tor of the British front followed the
repulse of four German attacks in
yesterday's fighting. The cannonad
ing was going on last night as if in
preparation for another desperate
German assault.
Documents found. in German
trenches captured in the recent Brit

convincing proof of the devastating

British guns cut them off from the
