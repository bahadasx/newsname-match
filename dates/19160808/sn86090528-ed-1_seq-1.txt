TATE'siOE
FAILS TO
SHOW UP
Special to the Express.
Ardmore, Okln., Aug. 8. Texas Tate
arrived in the city yesterday to get
ready for his return match with Jack
Hempell next Friday night, but when
he arrived he found that Hempell had
not put in his appearance but had re
fused to come and fulfill his date, ac
cording to previous agreement.
It is apparent that Hempell bas a
1 good reason for this move., From sub
( sequent events after the fight of last
Friday night the fans are now more
than convinced that Tate was not only
fouled deliberately in the second
round. This statement is borne out
by a statement from the physician who
examined Tate immediately after the
affair occurred as well as by several
who were' at the ring side and in close
proximity to where it oedirred. Hem
pell was called over the phone this
morning by Manager Edwards of the
Ardmore Athletic club and he refused
to come back on a proposition of his
own making when Edwards agreed to
meet bis terms. Hempell showed by
his conversation over the phone this
morning that ho has no intention of
meeting Tate again if he can run out
of it.
Hempell has not made a friend in
this city by his tactics and Tate saya
he will have to fight him if they ever
meet.
Tate payed his respects to Corrigan,
who refereed the match and intimated
that it was a frameup to take the
matcb away from him. Tate said that
at the end of the first round Hempell
for all his boasted condition, was
winded and he believed that he delib
erately fouled him to avoid a longer
session. Tate says that Hempell will
hare to meet him somewhere as there
is 110 reason for him to try and side
step. He is willing to meet him any
time, winner to take all, so it seems to
be up to Hempell to make good.

RECEIVES
PRAISE
Annual Report to State Superintendent
Wins Praise for Superintendent
and Miss Zina
County School Superintendent M. H,
Shepard was particularly pleased this
morning upon opening his mall to find
the following complimentary hitter
from SU'e Superintendent R. H. Wil
son s ortice 111 relation to the annual
report which was sent to the state su
perintendent of education from Grady
county: -
Oklahoma City, Aug. 7, lfllii.
Supt. M. 11. Shepard,
Chickasha, Oklahoma. '
Dear Friend:
You know I have a great deal of ad
miration for the man who keeps his
eyes on the main chance and remem
bers the promises he makes with him
self. I remember reading a few years
ago of a country boy who' entered one
of the big universities. The day he
ni'olled and was assigned a room ho
tacked a large "V" over his door. It
soon attracted the attention of '.c
other pupils and some of the inquisi
tive ones asked him what' it meant.
He would not, fell. -Otha guyed him
about it and called him "Henry the
Vth." He bore these taunts patiently
but. kept his secret, as ho called it.
At the end of the four year rm this
hoy was made the valedictorian of his
lass and then it was that he took his
class mates into his confidence and
told them the secret of the letter over
his door which had remained there all
the time. He said it was to remind
him that he had promised himself that
he was to be the valedictorian of his
graduating class and he tacked the
letter over the door as a perpetual re
minder of that promise.
S remember that just about a year
ago you were in the office and a num
ber of county superintendents,- old
timers, had made their report. You
said you had been working on yours
but owing to conditions over which
ou had 110 control that you would be
late in making your report. I remem
ber yon closed your conversation with
these words, "Next year I will be the
first to make my report."
The point I am making is this: 1
have just approved the first annual re-
port for this year and it is the report
of Grady county, signed on the back
"M. H. Shepard, County Superintend
ent." Congratulations, but you almost
missed. ' Two other reports have come
in but like yours they had to be re
turned for minor corrections.
1 know that part of this credit is due
to your helper, Miss Ziun. But it is
to your credit that you have selected
a capable and efficient assistant.
1 know that both of you are glad
this job is over. This enables you to
give all your time to the schools of the
county at the beginning of the term,
just when you can be the most help to
them.
With kindest personal regards, I am
Yours very truly,
H. J. MILLER.

was assisted by Bob Smith of Yukon.
Fifteen head of livestock were put
up for sale, but of these only three
were settled for through the clerk.
The rest were either not sold or sold
privately.
"This makes it hard for tho clerk.'"
said Arthur Ersland, clerk, "a he has
to collect DOe per head on live stock
which Is not sold; if be fails to collect
it, be must make the amount god. I
merely state this so that the farmers
