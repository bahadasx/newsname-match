Rep. Harrison of Mississippi,
in Stirring Speech Before
House Defends Wilson's
Mexican Course.
SAYS HUGHES IS OUT OF
TOUCH WITH PEOPLE
Declares Republican Candi

Make Him Unfit to Inter
pret Popular Will.
International News s-ervi-e:
WASHINGTON. Auer. K. De-ciar-Ing
that tile criticism directed by
Charlys Hvans Hughes, against the
administration's Mexican policy grow
out of "ignorance of the true policy
of Brest Wilson." Rep. R. I. Har
rison, of Mississippi, today delivered
a speech defending the president's
course in Mehico, on the lloor of the
house. Rrp. Harrison declared that
that stand taken by Candidate
Hughe rn the Mexican question was
prompted by Se i. Fall, of New Mex
ico and Henry Lane Wilson, "the
discredited ambassador to Mexico."
The statements made an to Mexico
hy Hughes in his acceptance speech
wtre characterized as "misleading"
ly the Misslppian, who is the ad
ministration's representative on the
foreign affairs committee.
MuM lie Out of Touch.
"When I recall the almost super
human decree of patience which
Pres't Wilson has shown in our
v hole Mexican policy." said Hep.
Harrison, "when I contemplate how
at times his firmness almost drove
us to actual war. and when I recall
the lack of criticism of his policy ly
the republican party during all this
time. I naturally conclude that the
republican nominee in his acceptance
ypeech. either is not in accord with
his party on thin question or that he
has allowed himself to be misled by
vertain advisers who are out of sym
pathy with the American people and
whose views touching Mexican af
fairs are forced by their own desire
to obtain from the American people
an approval of their outrageous and
shameful past conduct."
Hep. Harrison then pointed out
that Sen. Fall and former Ambas
sador Wilson had been railed upon
"by Hushes to submit their views on
the Mexican situation.
Divorci-tl from Commonality.
"If there is any place in the pub
lic service which divorces a man
from the 'common touch of man
kind, it is the supreme court bench.
Mr. Hughes cannot, therefore, be
justly criticized for his failure to be
informed about current events, in
cluding this government's policy to
ward Mexico during the past four
years." he continued.
Fiep. Harrison characterized the
Hughes acceptance speech as a
caustic, vitrolie and unfair i iti -ism
of the president's Mexican policy."
He took up three specific points at
tacked by Hushes, the refusal
to:
recognize Huerta. the handling of
the em ha reo on arms and munition,
and the failure to intervene. He
said that the lluclus criticism of
these force the conclusion that the
republican candidate would have
recognized Huerta, and would
J'orccd intervention.

After Early Call at Y.M. CA.
Karl Welsh is a native of Omaha,
Neb., who left the town of stock
yards and packing houses to come
to .s'outh Rend. He had heard that
this city was particularly suited to a
man who had taking ways.
The visitor arrived here last Satur
day and engaged a room at the Y.
M. C. A. He had not been there long
before his eagle eye noted that the
occupant of room 42S at the "Y."
was in the habit of leaving his door
open, even at night. Knowing that
such things are never done in
Omaha, this fact weighed upon Earl
until he wanted to know the "why
and wherefore of it.
He had seen "429" several times
and knew that the gentleman in that
room seemed to be a jolly, compan
ionable chap, so Karl, well-versed in
Nebraska hospitality, decided to pay
4imj a visit.
Karl was not aware that social
calls locally at least are made in
the afternoon or evening, so ho
chose 4 o'clock this morning as the
hour in which to get acquainted.

to awake at that early time and lind
Karl crouching at the foot of the
bed. The following dialogue took
place:
"What are you doing in my
room ?"
"I'm a somnambulist; I walk in
my slumbers."
"What number is your room?"
"How long have you been in our
fair city?"
