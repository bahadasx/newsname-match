AWAITING TO HEAR
FROM THE COUNTRY
Senate Finance Committee Low
ers Income Tax Exemption
Washington, Aug. 7. Democrats o'.
tho senate finance committee who vot
ed to lower the income tax exemption
in the revenue bill are anxiously
awaiting to hear from the country on
the recommendation, which will be
submitted to n party caucus some
time this week for approval.
Protests against It already have
been heard within the party. The
amendment prevailed in the commit
tee by a majority of but one vote, and
the minority propose to fight It In cau
cus. Its opponents will use as one
argument a suggestion from President
Wilson in his annual message to the
Sixty-fourth congress for a reduction
in tho exemption.
Administration leaders regard the
revenue problem now as quite tho
most important before congress, and
tho finance committee hopes to com
plete Its revision of the house bill sp
that it may he passed upon by the
party caucus and be ready for senate
action within ten days. The house
bill would provide for about $210,000.
000 in reenue. The flnnnce commit
tee Is working to present a bill that
would ylold $275,000,000 or more.
That the session may be extended
many weeks is possible, particularly
if threatened tiouble materializes In
the hnuso over the senate naval con
struction proarum. Conferees o! the
naval hill will undertake to reach an
agreement on that salient feature ot
the national defense legislation this
week.
