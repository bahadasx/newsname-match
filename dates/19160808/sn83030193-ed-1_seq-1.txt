from early morn to late at night, In

MRS. HUQHES GREETED BY
WOMEN'S COMMITTEE.
Mrs. Fred Upham, wife of tho Illi
nois National Committeeman, formed
tho head of a party of women who
greeted Mrs. Hughes. Tho cnndldotu'a
wife will have a busy day too.
Only Just started In his campaign
ing, Hughes to-dny had developed
an almost Roosovcltlan vocabulary
of denunciation and of aphorism.
Soma of his epigrams coined so far
are:
"The Democratic party U a party
for votes only.
"The Democratlo party came up
to the protection tax like a skittish
horse approaching a brass band.
"We're entitled to a standing
army, without taking men out of
civil life as in the Mexican moblll
zutlon, JUBt as much as a city Is
entitled to proper pollco protection."
"Thero's no danger of our going
to war unless the other ilde knowi
'we're too proud to tight.'
"Tho best way of making for effl
clency Is by making for contentment.'
HUQHES 18 NOT COLD IN WARM
WEATHER.
It is a baso libel, this story that
Hughes Is "cold." No human being
could have perspired any more than
the former Justlco of the Supremo
Court has done since ho left Ilrldgo
hampton on Haturday for his first
trial of presidential campaigning,
Just the samo the nomlneo sticks to
his whlto plquo vost and tho wing col.
tars he affects.
Tho collars wilt and drop over, hut
Hughes Just grins underneath his
beard by tho way it w.n trimmed
this morning by ono of tho useful boy
In tho private car and now distinctly
roveals tho grin and goes right
ahead.
Everyhody, of course, has shown
great Interest in Mrs. Hughes, That
story from Brldgohampton that she Is
carrying only one hat on tho trip wns
a base canard. It Is reliably stated
that there are at least threo. Up to

'ALK OF COMPROMISE.
Managers Are Asketl by "Big
Four" to Present Some
Definite Proposition.
A suggestion of compromise wns
mnde by tho railroad employees when
they presented to-dny tn the railroad
managers their resolve to strike un
less they get tho eight-hour day with
time nnd a half for all overtime. In
tho face of the fact that practically
all of tho 400,000 employees tn all
parta of the United States voted to
strike unless they get the eight-hour
day, those present at the conference
were pusiled when compromise, was
taked.-.of.
The conference was held In tho big
meeting room tf the Engineers' Build
ing. Thirty-ninth Street, near Sixth
A- . four hundred railroad t n's
dolegntes sat In tho body of tho hall,
Around n tablo on tho stugo wcro
grouped fourteen railroad managers,
facing W. L. (Inrretson, representing
thu conductor.!; W. H. Stone, tho en
gineers; Timothy Shen, tho. Hremen,
and W. O. Loe, tho trnlnmon'.
The votes of tho four brotherhoods
as to whether fir not they will strike
unions tho eight-hour day Is granted
was rcudy In dotal), it was Hiown
that 98 per cent, of tho entire mem
bership voted to strike, If need bo,
for tholr demands.
Thero wns deep silence after the
vole had jean announced. Then
Mr. Qarrctson, spokesman for all the
brotherhoods, arose and addressed
tho managers.
"Oontlemcn,' ho said, "you'vo got
our sldo of tho proposition. You see
how strong our men nru In support
of the claims vt have presented; you
know what the rank and lllo think
of this question.
"In the fuco if this record, If thero
Is any deslro on th part of the rail
road managura for a settlement
through modttlrutlon, I have this to
say: we will be glad to take up a
settlement on such a basis, but it
must be with the understanding
that the manager are going to bring
hero a definite proposition based on
u modification of some of tho things
they gave us to understand when we
discussed contingencies."
This was understood to refer to the
efforts of the railroad managers beforo
tho conference adjourned last Juno to
find out what was the least concession
tho employees would take.
"I want. Mr. uarretson added, "to
call your attention to tho fact that
your side has presented nt no time uny
definite proposition. What you did
was tn vet all thu Information out of
us. But If 'u nro ready to present u
modified proposition wu aro ready to
rllscllHS It,
Again fell an Impresslvo silence.
KIIhIiu Iu of tho railroad managers
urow!, Ho spokn slowly and gravely.
"Gentlemen," ho snld, "I realize, und
all tn" managers hero feel how Im
portant to thu country this Joint con
ferenio Is. I am not going to answer
your questions now In definite form.
Very shortly I shall tako up with the
managora a discussion of tho result of
this ballot and every other thing jwr
mining to It."
Thereupon tho conferenro was ad
Journcd until 10 A. M. to. morrow.
Tho managers) held a conferoncu nt
tho Grand Central Terminal this
afternoon to discus tho demands of
thu men, They did not appear to bo
deeply impressed y any danger or a
stiilio being oalled. To a reporter for
Tho livening World Grand Master
Htono of tho Knglneers ndmlttod that
he was not sum tho managers would
inako h counter proposition,
"Any proposal they bring In now
will bo put beforo tho proper com
mittee und discussed," ho mild.
"Does this mean that tho railroad
men aro going back from their tlrat
attitude?" ho was asked.
"As far ns I know," ho repllsd,
"thero will bn no chango at any tlmo
from tho original attitude."

500 STRIKERS IN
ON PEACE
Facts About the Car Strike
All existing tuifuce .nr tttik
to-aay, wnen it wu announced at city nail tnat officials
of the New York and Queena County, Staten Island and
Second Avenue lines had accepted the agreement adopted
last night by the Green Car and Third Avenue systems.
Dlows were exchanged at a ratification meeting of 500 strikers
when organizers were challenged to show that the
peace agreement benefitted the men.
On Staten Island a new feature
when the strike-breakers struck because they were not
permitted to pick out profitable runs. Only eleven cars
were in operation there and some disorder was reported.
Trolley service in Manhattan,
was rapidly getting back to normal and the army of
police on strike duty went back to the three-platoon
system.
The work of organizing the men of the subway and elevated
and D. R. T. lines was being rushed, according to labor
leaders.
D. R. T. employes received a letter to-day from President
T. S. Williams, granting them an increase in wages, a
modification of their "swings," and permission to
select, by secret ballot, members of committees to treat
with the company's officers in case of grievances.
All troublesome differences between the surface car lines of Man
hattan, the Bronx, Queens and Richmond were put on the way to peace
ful adjustment to-day. The signatures of the executives and directors
of the Second Avenue, Queens and Staten Island li'ies were added to
those of the New York Railways and Third Avenu: systems, attached
to the peace treaty last night. Meetings of motormen and conductors of
the lines accepting the terms voted to return to work at once.
With but slight- confusion service wis resumed a'l over the city.
The policemen who had been guarding barns and C2rs were withdrawn
and returned to their regular duties.
Labor leaders declared tho unionizing of the subway and elevated
linos and tho B. Tl. T. surface lines Is going forward rapidly, but demands.
If thero nro any following tho organization of the union on those lines,
are not to bo presented until arbitration proceedings on tho linos which
