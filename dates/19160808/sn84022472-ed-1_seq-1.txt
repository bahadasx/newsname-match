To Rectify Insanitary
Conditions. 1
On the ground that the system of
Ifcealth supervision in Connecticut is
I absolutely ineffectual and antiquated,
.physicians and others -will go before
'the legislature again at-the next ses
'aion Mdiinr a change.
Sum-erne power In the matter of
! Connecticut's health will be asked for
! the state health board, and the ap
Ipotntment of sanitary supervisors for
J each section or county; instead or tne
I lawyer ; county health officers, will be
'urged. ; -
It became, known today that Dr.
HValery, Havard of Fairfield, who has
been succeeded as local health officer
Ifcy Dr. William T. Nagle, resigned six
Iweeks ago because he believed County
. Health Officer George E. Hill failed to
co-operaia In sanitation work.;
J- Dr. W. H. Donaldson, who preceded
IDr. Havard as health officer of Falr
ueM. resigned for the same reason.
'.Dr. Donaldson held the position of
, health officer -In Fairfield for many
I years, doing excellent work along san
itation lines and taking; much time-.
If rom his extensive private practice to
work among the poor. Although he
accomplished great things, he believed
he was continually balked by th fail
ure of the county health officer to act
on his recommendations or to prose
cute when necessary. He wouldn't be
.quoted today; when questioned, on the
I matter, , but it is known that .he re
sumed for this reason. . -
His successor, Dt. Havard, who re
tired from the United States army as
: assistant urgeon general. In which as

!nly- after citizens of the .town 'had
nrxed him strenuously to give Fair
OeVd the benefit of his knowledge and
experience. Dr. Havard admitted to
ld ay "-at he- ran against the same
isnars.
: Moral suasion worked In most
eases, but some persons were obdur
ate or neglectful. The customary no
tiees to abate the nuisance within a
certain time were sent, after which it
was necessary to resort to threats to
prosecute, when nothing1 came of
these the persons Involved began to
look on the health officer as a roed
dlesome busybody, using i dlsdrimlna
tlon. :' I
It Is. known that Dr. Havard re
cently , had an unpleasant experience
with a more or less prominent family
that thought Its members shouldn't
be -quarantined. Cases like these, in
which the county health officer fails
to lend his support, are said to be of
frequent occurrence.
' ' Health officers In this county com
.plain also the county official will not
take their word about Insanitary con
ditions but must see them himself be
'fore taking- a step. It is their con
tention that his business is merely
to prosecute; . : '. . v
The abolition of the lawyer system,
with its attendant political features.
and giving the prosecution into the
hands Df the local authorities, will be
,-the aim of those who go before the
legislature seeking form. They( want
the state boara or neaita to pe su
preme In health matters. They will
suggest dividing the state into dis
tricts and having a competent sani
tary supervisor in charge of each.
: At the town meeting of Fairfield
next fall, an effort will be made to
have the voters approve a system of
local health supervision whereby two
or three towns, Westport and Fair
field, for Instance, will hire a sard
tary expert. Fairfield, it is pointed
out by both former health oflcers. is
crowded In sections and health is -be
ing menaced by the methods of offal
disposal.
Abolition of privy Vaults and col
lection of garbage, either by the town
or by Individual subscription, will be
urged. ' t

. ; .. . Prevents Deadlock
Stonfngton, Conn., Aug. 8 A voter
-.evith humorist Inclinations on Monday
saved Stonington borough the neces
sity of spending $40 for another elec
' tion by casting, his ballot for the vil
lage, barber, Anthony Squadrito, for
burgess Instead of for either of the
.regularly nominated candidates. This
gave the. election to James L. Stivers,
Republican, by a vote of 62 to 51. This
special election followed the regular
election a week ago when Stivers and
Robert I Burtch, Democrat, were
'tied with 118 votes each.

SEVENTH DEATH
FROM PARALYSIS
RECORDED HERE
Bridgeport Has Only Half as
Many Cases as New Ha
ven, Figures Show.
The seventh death of infantile par
alysis In Bridgeport since the out
break of the epidemic occurred yes
terday afternoon when Antony Siminl
of 826 North Washington avenue, suc
cumbed. ' . ' '
.Three new suspected cases were re
corded today and removed to Hill
side home. They are Albin' Belen
kiewicz, aged 8 months, of 72 Sum
mer street, the five weeks old son of
Walter Blude, 880 Grand street and
Frank Murphy of 82 Poplar street..
, The- Chamber of Commerce is form
ing a committee to co-operate with
the health board in general sanitation
work. -' The committee of five, three
members of which have been select
ed, wjlKbe completed by the end of
this week. . t
.The Bridgeport ' health authorities
decided today to take Helen Keminls
ky of Fairfield, a positive case, into
Hillside home. This was done this
morning .- for ' the protection of
Bridgeport children as ' Fairfield has
no isolation facilities. .
Dr. Sophian again urged today the
advisability of municipal collection of
refuse. He said the people of Bridge
port should begin at onde to plan for
this.
"Accumulation of refuse is a men
ace," he said. "You'll never have a
clean city until you have systematic
removal of refuse.
"Chickens, stray'' cats and, dogs,
delving in ruse. certainly distribute
the germs they . acquire over large
areas. ; Especially Is this .true of
cats and dogs. - ' Children pet them
and are endangered by Infection."
... . Yard inspections,' Dr, Sophian said-
today, : should ;;b t unnecessary
Bridgeport. He said that by this time
the. people should have 'their' yards
clean and be in the habit -of keeping
them clean. His corps of Inspectors
reported that out of 8,600 yards
examined, 6,000 were In good, condi
tion,, which he thought was a favor
able report. , But, he declared, even
one insanitary yard in 10 is objection
able. . f i
- As a result . of Inspectors' reconn-
mendatlons. 1,000 persons are getting
garbage cans. "
.'Dr.' Sophian advised parents today
not to allow children to fondle pet
animals until the epidemic dies out.
Because, of a misunderstanding,
some clergymen In the city have be
lieved Dr. Sophian Is suggesting clos
ing churches to adults. - Dr. Sophian
said this morning that the epidemic
here isn't serious enough to warrant
such a step,' and anyway -he wouldn't
ask to have the churches closed and
allow theatres and other places of con-
gregation to remain open. He said
that in the present situation, congrega
tions are dangerous only to children.
Encouragement was derived by Dr.
Sophian from the fact that Bridgeport
has 30 cases of poliomyelitis as op
posed to New Haven's 45. The Elm
City and Its suburbs have 60 in all,
and twice as many have died there as
in Bridgeport. :
- Considering that Bridgeport Is. 20
miles nearer New York, that it is
more crowded and conditions in gen
eral are not as good as in New Haven.
Dr.' Sophian believes that the health
measures adopted here are responsible
for the less ' virulent ravages of the
disease.

FROM SUBMARINE FREIGHTER;
' CARGO IS ASSEMBLED THERE.
Boston, Aug. 8 While, it was gen
erally conceded that one guess was as
good as another, those who argue that
the German submarine Bremen will
find refuge In Boston harbor were
encouraged today by persistent re
ports that an outside cargo for the
merchantman was . being assembled
here. According to these reports,
which could not be traced locally to
a definite source, the cargo will con

from Cross Island down and have all

West End residents are vigorously
protesting thee ontemplated purchase
of the Wordln estate by the city of
Bridgeport for .a' seweragey disposal
plant. It has been conceived by the
representative property owners in that
section of Bridgeport between Bail-
road avenue, Cedar and Burr Creeks
that the city not only designs to erect
a pumping plant but also an incinerat
ing ' plant where by-products can be
loaded directly onto barges for ship
ment elsewhere by water.
At a meeting of the Hungarian
Business Men's association held last
night vigorous action was sought -to
overcome the project and resolutions
were adopted calling for an injunction
against the project. .Attorney Ernest
Berger has been retained to take such
legal action as may be deemed neces
sary. '.
. A call for a mass, meeting of citi
zens in the West End has-been issued
and a definite date will be set within
the next two weeks when the opin
ions of the various property owners in
the section will be stated publicly.
It was said at yesterday's meeting
of the Hungarian Business Men's as
sociation that nearly 10,000 persons
are located within a small radius of
the proposed site for the pumping sta
tion, that two school houses are near
by and , that an incineration plant
would-be. detrimental to property

BRIDGEPORTER IS
BACK FROM LAND
OF CARRANZISTAS
M.- A. Pollock Returns To
Locomobile Co. After In
teresting Experiences.
After many Interesting experiences
in roughing it with , the motor truck
contingent at Columbus, N. M., and
in Mexico., M. A. Pollock, who went
to the border a month ago in the
interests of the . Locomobile Co. of
America, ( returned to Bridgeport to
day. -
His stories of the performances of
motor trucks were devoured - with
avidity by his associates in the Loco
mobile Co. of America's plant, where
men are working day and night on
orders for . Biker trucks for . the
United States army.
Notable among the experiences of
the Brldgeporter was a trip on a
Kiker truck train from Columbus,
N. M., to Colonia Dublan, where Gen
eral Pershing's headquarters is situ
ated, thence on to El Valle, the ex
treme of - the punitive expedition's
lines, 'where, at that time. General
Pershing was located. '
General Pershing was ill on the ar
rival of the motor truck train, and
none of the contingent saw him in the
brief time occupied in delivering the
supplies before the "return trip was
begun. -
Mr. Pollock reflected the general
modesty that characterizes the Loco
mobile Company's executives, In dis
cussing the performances of the
trucks made in this ciy.
"There is a repair shop In Colum
bus," said Mr. Pollock. "It was built
by the army, with the co-operation of
our men. It has a capacity of 100
trucks. There are many types of
trucks' on the border. There have
been never more than three Riker
trucks in the repair shop."
Mr. Pollock brought back many in
teresting sidelights of the record trip
of the Kiker train of 30 trucks. One
of these was the dismissal of charges
against certain drivers who were
threatened with court martial for
balking at protracted work. The
charges against the men were dis
missed on recommendation of their
superiors, following the exploit of

SENATE ACCEPTS
CONFERENCE BILL
FOR LARGE ARMY
No Debate As Upper House
Passes Biggest Appro
riation Law.
MEASURE TO CARRY
OVER $267,500,000
Development of Aviation to
Require Expenditure of
$13,000,000.
Washington, Aug. 8. Without de
bate, the Senate today agreed to the
conference report on the army appro
priation bill carrying $267,697,000 for
maintenance of the reorganized reg
ular army and national guard.
The only criticism of the report
came from Senator Clapp of Minne
sota, who protested against elimina
tion of the LaFollette amendment In
creasing the minimum age limit for
enlistment from 18 to 21 years without
consent of parents or guardians. Be
cause of this he voted against the re
port.
The bill provides for organization of
a council for national defense to co
ordinate transportation, industrial and
agricultural facilities in time of stress,
lor relief of dependent families of sol
diers in service on .the Mexican bor
der, and appropriate a special sum of
more than $13,000,000 for development
of aviation In the army.
LIEUTENANTS OF
POLICE MUST DO
TURN ON STREET
-. i
Supt. Redgate to Send Of-1
ficers Out For Two Hours
" a Day.
In orders issued today by Supt. J.
H. Redgate, desk lieuteants are In
structed to do street duty two hours
every; day. Motorcycle Policeman
CWMoid -Gorgas. Is taker) - from ' the
motorcycle squad and given a Abeat
to patrol and the men were Instruct
ed as to the place they are to pur
chase their dress coats and over
coats. -..
The order which states that lieuten
ants must do two hours street duty
every day results from careful Inves
tigation by the members of the po
lice commission who believe that the
service will be greatly benefited by
having the lieutenants make , the
rounds for a couple of hours a day.
While the .lieutenants are on the
street, the sergeants will . be called
upon to do the desk work and it will
be up to the lieutenants to' arrange
for the hours on which they are to
be. relieved. No set time has been
designated on the shifts' for the lieu
tenants to go upon the streets. The
order became effective today.
As Policeman Gorgas has been a
member of the, motorcycle squad
since his appointment five years ago,
his" relegation to the patrolling squad
came as quite a- shock to the other
members of the department. .Before
appointment to the regular force, he
was a special policeman and did mo
torcycle duty in the West End, catch
ing many automobile speeders. When
selected to don a regular's unitorm,
he was assigned to the motorcycle
squad and continued his work In the
campaign to squelch speeders and vio
lators of the law.
It Is rumored that ' the shift of
Gorgas, the dean of the motorcycle
sauad. is the result of friction be.
tw'een him and Lieutenant Charlea A.
Wheeler, who has charge of traffic.
The motorcycle squad is under . tne
jurisdiction of the traffic officer and
as Gorgas' expectation of being ap
pointed a sergeant and placed in
cnarge of the traffic, was not fulfilled.
he has been disgruntled, according to
report. '
Gorgas will be succeeded on tne mo
torcycle squad by Policeman Arthur
Salmon. Gorgas has been assigned to
the Third Precinct station and will pa
trol post 15 on the D shift, which goes
on at 11 o'clock tonight. Policeman
Michael J. Larney will patrol Salmon's
former beat from headquarters on the
A platoon.
In the uniform orders, all members
of the department who were appointed
before June 1 are Instructed to pur
chase their dress coats and overcoats
from Meigs & Co. The men In the
department who' were appointed re
cently will purchase their dress coats
from Levy & Co.of New Tork.of whom
the new uniforms were purchased.
The overcoats will be purchased of
Meigs & Co. Cans also will be pur
chased at Meigs & Co.
