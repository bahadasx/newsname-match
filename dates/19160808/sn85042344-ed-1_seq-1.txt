Won't lncrcn.se Strength.
Agreement was reached by the con
ferees on administrative features of
the personnel section, but they did not
agree on the ciuestion of increases
In the enlisted strength. The admin
istration is anxious that the enlarged

for a total enlisted strength of 74,
001) and the Ionise for only 61,000.
Secretary Daniels' plan for promo
tion of navy officers by selection in
stead of seniority was accepted, but
was so amended that It would not
apply to officers lower than the rank

for a board of nine admirals to pass
on the promotion and six must agree

nounces the discovery that paper can
be manufactured from cotton stalks
1 The discovery is not considered of

produces no cotton, but is pointed to
i us of vast importiincc to the United
States, the greatest producer of col
ton in the world, because of the short
age of paper reported in that country.
Tre discovery was made, It Is stated,
by a Herman institution while carry

shipment of stalks, which had arrived
I from KgyTd In-fore the opening of hos-
tilities was used for the experiment.
The stalks were cut and ground

the testing office to arrive at the
1 decision that cotton stalks are a good
material for making paper.

Hughes, In the first set speech
of his transcontinental trip, tonight
assailed the administration vigorously
for its foreign policy, its Mexican pol
isy, for appointing men whom In
termed inexperienced to diploinalic
posts and for whit he dial a tcrizod
as a "raid upon the civil service of tho

"He kept us out of war," Mr.
Hughes said, icferritig to the presi

policy of the ailniinlstr.itioM will In

trouble Is that this administration has
written such a record that no matter
whal II says, you do not know whoro
It will stick to it."
Mr. Hughes, at tho meeting at
Arcadia hall, said in part:
"You have here the problem yf the
sudden Introduction of a lariie alien,
population. You did not remain in
different. You sot an example in
Americanization to all America, and
we point to Detroit as tho one place
In this land where there has been
shown a quickening of interest In the
development of training and Ameri
canizing of alien men and women who
have come to this land.
Wc .Wmiic Obligations.
"It is perfectly Idle to expect a
sound sentiment of American unity of
those who come among us as strang
ers, come merely to be exploited.
When we admit to this country men
and women we assiimo obligations
with respect to their training, as well
as grant to them the privileges; and
we have got in this country to be
awake to those obligations and to
realize that in every community there
must be a. well-organized effort to
make America supreme in the thought
if every one who comes into the com
munity; to have the language under
stood and spoken; to have American
sentiment replace foreign sentiment;
to have Aui'-ricun Ideals replace for
ilgn Ideals; to have a realization that
this is a country not simply giving an
opportunity to work for dollars, but
a country that Is devoted to the bet
terment of human life; to the enlight
enment to the standards of human
thought; to the liberalization of all
those tilings connected with human
understanding and purpose; we want
America first In the mind and heart
of everyone In this land.
"Put America is not simply a land
for the man of special talent or of
distinguished aptitude. This is the
home of the average man, the or
dinary man who is doing his best,
whatever, by talent or aptitude, and
In our large Industrial occupations
where thousands are gathered to

the working men looked after; every

appropriate means for education, for

working man who is in his job and
excels to continue In that Job ought
to feel that he is doing something
worth while for a community that ap
preciates it and gives him a fair
chance to lead a happy and a decent
life.
"We have got along In this country
altogether too easily with our wealth
of natural resmtces. We have been
content, living apart in their separate
lives, to try to make something for
their individual selves: but now we
have reached a point w here It is neces
sary, as it has been necessary abroad,
to try to reduce all waste, to try to
prevent all unnecessary outlay and lo
try to make business successful ac
cording to the merit of a well-organized,
economically conducted business.
"I want efficiency in the govern
