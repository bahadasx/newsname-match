FRIDAY HOTTEST
OFjHE SEP
Government Thermometer Reluct­
antly Moves up at Relentless
Bun Waxes Hotter.
\'*f' Friday proved to l)e the hot
''"test day of the summer when the re
lentless sun waxed hotter and' hot
ter as the day advanced. Added to
the scorching rays of the sun,
.burning, blistering, slitheringly hot
wind blew all day long almost cook
ing vegetation. Thd government
thermometer, situated in the shade
always conservative in its estimate
reluctantly moved up the scale until
nearly 4 o'clock in the afternoon
when it stopped at 105} degrees
Everyone was willing it should stop,
As far as could be learned there
were no objections.
But In the
Bun—that
was a differ­
ent story. The feet of pedestrians
were burned by the hot pavementB
and steering wheels of automobiles
parked in the downtown district
were hot to the, touch. The cool
wind which blew over this section
late in the qvening was as welcome
as the flowers in spring, and today
the thermometer will not reach the
hundred mark in the shade.

THE MTMH GUARD
i'
Believed at Des Moines That the
War Department and Regular
SR'
Army Want Such Results?
Word comes from Des Moines that
friends of the ^national guards in
that city and throughout Iowa be
Ueve the war department at Wash
ington, through the Influence of the
regular army, is setting about to
make the national guard so unpop
ular with (hose who are members of
it that once out they will not go in
to the service again. It is claimed
that this is one of the most effective
ways of killing off the guard and
thus giving the whole army field to
the regular army.
The latest move here in Iowa of
bringing the cavalrymen who refus
ed to take the federal oath to Fori
Des Moines and requiring them to do
service down on the border regard
less of whether they take the fed
eral oath or not is cited as further
evidence on the part of the war de
partment to make the guard unpop
ular. Then the smalt pay given the
men. the failure to provide trans
portation for them back home when
mustered out or honorably discharg
ed down at Brownsville, their fail
ure to equip the guard in anything
like an adequate manner, these are
some of the things, guardsmen say,
which will kill the guard. Loyal
and'patriotic young men do not like
this sort of treatment. Neither do
they wish to become professional
soldiers and give up their life oc
cupations.
HARDWARE MEN PRE
DICT HUNTFRS
High Prioes of Ammimition Will
r.
Cool Hunting Proclivities of
Sportsmen.
When the^ hunting season opens
I Sept. 1st, this year, there will be
many sportsmen who make for tall
'-i. timber, but there will not be as
^many as in former years. Reason?
Because of the ascendency of am
munition prices.
The European war is for the
manyeth time responsible for the
high price of something, only this
time it Is guns and cartridges and
shotgun shells. Six months ago
hardware dealers in this city receiv
"ed a notice from the wholesalers of
a 15 per cent Increase in all ammun
ition prices. One month ago they
-received another notice of a 20 per
rent increase over the price. Shells
which formerly sold at 65 cents per
.rifMftwii
box, now retail at $1.
Winchesters and Remmingtons al
so have been included in the sky
ward prices. These rifles have risen
in price at least 35 per cent sincc
last season. As a result of this,
there will not be nearly as many
hunters as in previous seasons and
perhaps it will be just as well for
the supply of wild game that there
are not to be so many for a few
yearfe.
Prospects are fairly good for an
abundance of wild fowl this fall, and
within a few weeks there will be an
exodus of huntsmen for the north
ern lakes, but probably not in as
large numbers as' heretofore.
All kinds of job printing done
neatly and promptly at tlie Free
man-Tribune Job department.
SWIMMING fOOt
ALMOST COMPLETES
Pool to be Filled With Water as
Test—To be Used by Men,
Women and Children.
The new swimming pool which
the park, commissioners have been
working on in Nokomis park tor the
past six weeks, ii now almost done
and within a few days will be pump
ed.full of water a£ a test to find out
if the soil will hold the water. It
the silt, which composes the soil at
this place, acts as does clay, the
water will be pumped off and gravel
be rolled into the bottom of the ex
cavation for the pool. A gravel bot
tom/will give a better footing for
swimmers than concrete, and this
will be used if possible.
However, should the water leak
out too rapidly, the whole will have
to be concreted, rfldes and bottom, at
considerably grtater cost. A cen
trifugal pump will All the excava
tion with water from the r+rw, and
_R. 0. Clark JB now putting in a iam
near his ice house which will raise
the water in the, river about two
feet. The park commissioners have
been to no small work to dredge
the river near the park bf trees,
stumps, snags, 6tc., to make a fit
place for swimmers.
The popl is 170x60 feet in dimen
sions, with one side and one end of
shallow depth to enable women and
children to use the pool to the best
advantage. A depth of six feet is
attained on the deep side for swim
mers and divers."' The pool will be
in use within a few weeks.
The swimming frool will not be us
ed exclusively for women and chll
dren, for men will also use the re
sort, but it is expected that the for
mer will make far greater use of it
than the male swimmers.
A perfect drainlias been installed
which will take About, three hours
to empty the water and upon the
shallow side of the pool, wagon
loads of sand will be hauled, that
children may play upon the sandy
beach" If they so desire while
their mothers disport themselves in
the water. Thb' swimming pool
promises to be tlie most popular re
sort yet provided in this city and
wilt fully repay the park commis
sioners for the time and trouble
spent In perfecting it.
Former Resident Re-Elected.
Rev. Ij. H. Sours, a former pastor
of the Christian church in this city,
who gave up the tninistry here two
years ago, accepting a position as as
sistant cashier in the State Savings
Bank in Hampton, was re-elected
this year to the position. Thd Hamp
Um Chronicle says of the re-election:
Friends of Messrs. Hennlngsen
and Sours will be pleased that in the
reorganization of the bank they have
been selected to continue in the posi
tions they have held for the past two
years. They have the confidence or
the people, are both courteous and
accommodating, and can be depend
on to give patrons of the bank
the best possible service.
Condition of Ross Baby.
The condition of the little baby of
Mr. and Mrs. O. N. Ross, which has
been seriously III at times for a year,
changed suddenly Friday for the
worse, and the child, which last
week seemed much better, has been
critically ill since that time. A
trained nurse is in attendance and
today the little sufferer seems a trifle
improved. The trouble so recently
developed is auto-infection, a serious
bowel disorder.,'

progressing with almost wonderful
rapidity. Workmen are darting here
and there inside and outside car

ceptional architectural beauty—of
brown pressed brick with white
stone trimmings. The arrangement
of windows above is cspeclaly artis
tic. Below, the lobby of the thea
ter occupies the center and slopes
gently up from the sidewalk. A
canopy will extend from the front
of the lobby to the edge of the side
walk, covering a space about 12 feet
square, the whole electrically light
ed with art glass sides. The canopy
will be supported by chains from the
front of the building instead of the
old fashioned posts and this alone
will cost about $800.
The floor of the lobby is to be til
ed, the foyer to be equipped with
adequate toilet rooms and the entire

ONE ON MAJORS
LUND JD PHILPOT
They are Punished by Col. N. P.
Hyatt for Being Late at
Troop Review.
Brownsville, Tex., Aug. 7.—One
hundred and fifty men of the First
Iowa regiment held a demonstration
in the regimental street last night
because they had not been paid.
Shouting. "No pay, no drill,"
"Forty-seven days without pay," and
"We want our pay," they paraded
for half an hour. They were start
ing for brigade headquarters to see
General Allen when Colonel Bartley
dispersed them.
The men captured a turtle and
painted on Its back, "I am the First
regiment looking for my pay." They
then fastened a lighted candle on its
back and turned it loose. It went
to Colonel Bartley's tent and crawl
ed under the floor.
The entire regiment Is flat broke.
All the men are penniless. They
have been forced to use the Boidler's
frank in order to mail their letters
home.
The commanders of the regiment
have loaned all their money to the
men. They, too, are feeling the need
of their pay.
Colonel Bartley says the payroll
was submitted to the authorities
a week ago. The Third regiment
has received Its July pay. The Sec
ond has been paid for June. No ex
planation has been received from
Fort Brown as to the cause of the
delay.
Majors Lund and Philpot of the
Second Iowa regiment were punished
by Colonel Hyatt for being late at
troop review yesterday. Review first
was called off and the majors rode
off to town. The orders were chang
ed and they returned to camp to find
the battalions forming.
They will not be permitted to
leave camp for three days, according
to the announcement made by Col
onel Hyatt.

Letter from Mrs. Wiltsey.

here in 1854 with the two Beach
families. She is now 92 years of age
and writes a legible hand upon in
teresting subject matter. She speaks
in her manuscript of picking huckle
berries, so one may judge that hei*
days of usefulness are not yet over.
The Wlltseys built a log house first
upon their home place, corner of Su
perior and Ohio streets, and later
moved that back for a barn, build
ing in 1857 the house now owned
and occupied by F. A. Bonebright.

Movie Theater Buys Simplex Model
for Theater—Will Soon In-

A.- C. Schuneman, proprietor of
the Isis theater, last week purchased
for his use a fine new Simplex mov
ing picture projector and put the
same into use the first time Satur
day night.
The machine is a gem and throws
the pictures upon the screen with re
markable clearness and with entire
absence of the "flicker," so injurious
to the eyes. Those who saw the pro
gram at the Isis Saturday night were
delighted with the Improvement in
the pictures. This new machine
places the old one and two rdels may
be inserted at the same time, mak
ing a thirty minute continuous pict
ure.
Some idea of the excellence of the
machine: may be given when it is
known that "The Birth of a Nation"
is projected by Simplex machines.
Mr. Schuneman expects in the near
future to add a second Simplex ma
chine, giving a continuous picture
program.
