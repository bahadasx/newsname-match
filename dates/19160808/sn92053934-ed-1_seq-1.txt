Senate Puts
O.K. on Army
Fund Report
Washington, Aug. S. Without de
bate the senate today agreed to the
conference report on the army appro
priation bill carrying $267,597,000 for
maintenance of the reorganized regu
lar army and national guard.
The only criticism of the report
came from Senator Ciapp of Minne
sota who protested against elimina
tion of the La Follette amendment in
creasing the minimum age limit for
enlistment from 18 to 21 years with
out consent of parents or guardian.
Because of this he voted against the
report.
The bill provides for organization
of a council for national defense to
co-ordinate transportation, industrial
and agricultural facilities in time of
stress, for relief of dependent families
of soldiers in service on the Mexican
border and appropriates a special sum
of more than $13,000,000 for develop
ment of aviation in the army.
The naval bill also was in its last
stages today, although failure of con
ferees to agree on the important
building and personnel provisions
made necessary the less speedy meth
od of referring senate and house dif
erences back to these bodies. If the
house, even under administration
pressure, refuses to accept the senate
provisions for building 66 vessels, in
cluding eight capital ships next year
and for an enlisted strength of 74,000
men, it is considered probable the sen
ate will abandon its three year contin
uing program in an effort to compro
mise. The house plans to vote on this
measure next Tuesday or Wednesday.
RESUME NORMAL
CAR OPERATIONS
w York Street Railway Lines Again
Have Regular Service as Culmin
ation of a Strike.
New York, Aug. 8. Normal service
of the most important surface street
car lines in Manhattan and the Bronx
was resumed today after having been
partially interrupted by strikes of
motormen and conducrors beginning
about two weeks ago and culminating
Friday night last in a walkout of the
men employed by the New York Rail
ways company. About 7,500 employes
of this company and of the Third ave
nue railway system are affected by
the settlement agreed upon yesterday.
Under terms of the agreement the
right of employes to organize is con
ceded and the two companies prom
ised to treat with the committees of
their employes in considering griev
ances. A demand for increased wages
will be discussed by committees not
later than Aug. 30, and if they fail'of
the agreement the controversy will be
submitted to arbitration.
Strikes by employes of the Second
avenue, Queens and Staten Island
street railway systems have not been
adjusted, but the men believe they
also would be granted concessions.
THE WAR TODAY J
The Russians hare won a great
victory south of the Dniester in
Galicia. opening np a breach 15

The Russians in their drive cap

No Further Trace of Under
sea Craft Discovered
by Watchers.
CARGO IS ARRIVING
Secret Shipments of Nickel
and Rubber Being Re
ceived for Craft.
Portland, Me., Aug. S. No further
trace has been reported today of two
vessels believed by the coast guard
lookout who sighted them to be sub
marines which appeared off the Mains
coast near Machiasport yesterday.
Cross Island, where the lookout was
stationed, is at the mouth of the Bay
of Fundy and close to British terri
torial waters off the provinces of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia,
The Cross Island lookout estimated
the speed of the boats at ten or 12
knots. Keeping close to the three mile
limit, they would have had time to
reach this port early today. To reach
Boston, following a similar course,
would require eight or ten hours long
er. Cargo Arriving.
Boston, Aug. S. While it was gen
erally conceded that one guess was as
good as another those who argued that
the German submarine Bremen will
find refuge in Boston harbor were en
couraged today by perisstenet reports
that an outgoing cargo for the mer
chantman was being assembled here.
According to these reports, which
could not be traced to a definite
source, the cargo will consist of nick
el and rubber which are being brought
to town in a way to escape observa
tion. Expected This Afternoon.
Marine observers had their glasses
pointed east by northeast. They fig
ured that if the Bremen were one of
the submersibles picked up off Cross
Island on the Maine coast yesterday
she ought to turn Cape Ann this af
ternoon. She could hug the coast from
Cross Island down and have all the
water she needed within the three
mile limit. Shipping men were puzzled
to know why she should continue sub
merged when she could, with perfect
security from hostile interference,
come into port with colors flying. It
was suggested that her captain might
wish to keep his course a secret.
Columbus, Ohio, Aug. 8. That the
second German merchant submarine
Bremen is in possession of the French
navy is the information received by
Lieutenant J. G. McKlroy, United
States army office, from a relative in
the British army. Lieutenant McElroy
it stationed here with the Ohio Na
tional Guard. Lieutenant McElroy has
just received a letter from this rela
tive who is now at Folkstone. The
letter declares that the Bremen was
captured on its outward trip to the
United States.

Repub Party
Is Attacked
by Harrison
Washington, Aug. S. Replying to re
publican criticisms of President Wil
son's Mexican policy in the house to
day. Representative Harrison of Mis
sissippi declared the attacks were
prompted by a desire to create a false
campaign issue rather than to see the
policy changed.
JMT t-rr ison mentioned particularly
former 'Justice Hughes' speech accept
ing the republican nomination and
speeches in congress by Senator Fall
and Representative Rodenberg of Illi
nois. Mr. Hughes' statements as meaning
that he would have recognized Huerta,
would not have issued munitions em
bargoes and would have intervened in
Mexico.
"If Mr. Hughes were president," he
added, "the country would be at war
and instead of a sky reflecting the
color from the furnaces of prosperous
factories, it would be reflecting red
streams of blood from noble sons."
In answer to a statement by Repre
sentative Rodenberg that the embargo
on munitions was lifted shortly after a
visit to Secretary Lansing by Cleve
land H. Dodge, a munition manufac
turer and a large contributor to the
democratic campaign fund in 1912, Mr.
Harrison read a telegram from the sec
retary saying he had never seen Mr.
Dodge. The telegram also said the
permit for the shipment of certain mu
nitions belonging to Mr. Dodge's com
pany, which had been held up at Doug
las, Ariz., was issued 10 days prior to
the Parral fight instead of soon after
it, as Mr. Rodenberg had declared.
TAKE SURVIVORS'
BLOOD FOR SERU
New York, Aug. 8. Twelve persons
who have recovered from attacks of
infantile paralysis have volunteered to
give quantities of their blood to be
used in the preparation of serum for
the treatment of the disease, as the
result of an appeal for volunteers in
fighting the epidemic. Sufficient blood
was taken from two of the volunteers
to treat nine cases.
Richard T. Crane, Jr., the Chicago
manufacturer, telegraphed Mayor
Mitchel from Jefferson, N. H., last
night that he will give $25,000 to the
physician who can offer the best cure
or preventive for infantile paralysis
within the next year. A majority vote
of the American Medical association is
to decide who shall receive the reward.
The spread of the epidemic among
the homes of the wealthy New York
men in the suburban districts of Long
Island is one of the latest develop
ments. The intense heat and humidity wave
which has gripped New York is coin
cident with another big increase in
the epidemic of infantile paralysis.
Only once since the plague got its
start, six weeks ago, were there more
cases than reported in today's health
department bulletin. During the 24
hour period ending at 10 a. m., 53 chil
dren died of the disease in the greater
citv and 1S3 new cases were reported.
Chicago, Aug. 8. Chicago now has
40 cases of infantile paralysis, accord
ing to Dr. John Dill Robertson, city
health commissioner. Three new casees
were reported yesterday.

THE PRIZE MELON
ACCEPT PLAN
OFCARRANZA
FOR MEETING
Administration Decides to
Agree to Suggestion for
Settling Case.
Washington, Aug. S. The adminis
tration has decided to agre-e to Gen
eral Carranza's suggestion in his last
note for the discussion of points of dif
ference between the United States and
Mexico by a commission of six mem
bers and will proceed at once to the
selection of the three American repre
sentatives. This will be done on the
understanding that after the points
proposed by General Carranza are dis
posed of other questions will be taken
up.
The Carranza government wants to
take up the border situation first by
the proposed joint international com
mission but is willing that other mat
ters should be discussed later. Eliseo
Arredondo so outlined the Mexican at
titude today to Acting Secretary Polk,
who took the information to the cab
inet meeting.
It was indicated that state depart
ment officials were satisfied with the
situation and the appointment of
American commissioners might be ex
pected any time.
Mr. Arredondo assured Secretary
Polk that General Carranza's state
ment in his last note that the commis
sioners preferably would discuss the
subjects outlined in the original pro
posal merely meant that preference
would be given to the border situation
but that other questions were not ex
cluded. He said also that he regarded
the last Mexican note as one of com
plete compliance with American sug
gestions and it was on that basis Mr.
Polk took the matter to the cabinet.

eral hours to preparing the substance

Strike Case
AtMeeting
New York, Aug. 8. A decision as to
whether 400,000 employes of 235 rail
road systems in the United States shall
go on strike to enforce their demands
for an eight hour day and pay at the
rate of time and a half for overtime
is expecJ:edJo,rsujt.Iroiu a jconference
of the national conference on rail
railroad brotherhoods which was re
sumed here today. Earlier in the sum
mer the railroad managers rejected
roads with the heads of the four great
most of the demands of the brother
hoods prepared to arbitrate in accord
ance with the Newlands act.
Since then the union officials have
taken a vote of members of their or
ganizations on the question of wheth
er a strike shall be declared if their
demands again are refused. It has
been stated that the great majority of
the men voted to strike if necessary.
The result of the vote will be announ
ced to the railroad managers today.
More than twenty railroad managers
are members of the committee repre
senting the railroads, while the men
are represented by Warren S. Stone,
grand chief of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers; W. G. Lee,
head of the Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen; A. B. Garretson, head of
the Order of Railway Conductors and
W. S. Carter, head of the Brotherhood
of Firemen and Enginemen.
No decision was looked for today. It
was reported that the managers would
ask for a delay of sevral days to con
sider the proposals of the men and that
the final answer would be given at
another meeting later in the week.
Possibility of a strike is regarded by
the business interests of the country
as extremely grave and much pressure
has been brought to bear upon both
the railroads and the men to consent
to some method of arbitration.
