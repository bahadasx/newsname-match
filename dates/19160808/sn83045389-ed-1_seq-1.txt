Nineteen nflrtltlon.il cases of typhoid

number now under treatment in Rich

No l^t up 1" the number of reported

Careful analysis of the city's water
supply, made dally from samples taken
from widespread sources and by tlu>-?
bacteriologists. shows no indication
that It is responsible for the unusual
number of cases, but the authorities
are taking no chances with It. Ah soon
as possible examination will be made
of nil spring water which is being
???upplled to Richmond consumers in
bottles for drinking purposes.
Many inquiries were made to 'lie
Health Department yesterday as to
what was meant by "boiling water."

Pr. Devy said that this treatment
will bring the city's water to the
highest state of purification which Is
possible. The portion of the. city
served by the high-pressure system,
' the West Knd and Franklin and Grace
Streets as far east as Fifth Street, will
receive water which has been treated
to-day. Consumers getting water
through the low-pressure system will
not receive it for one or two clays, as
it is forced to pass first through the

The health authorities are rapidly
throwing protection about, those sources
which they believe may be the i auses

Attacks Wilson for Mexican Pol
icy and Raid on Civil
Service.
SAYS HIS SHAME IS DEEP
Promises, if Elected, to See That
American Rights Are
Respected.
MKTItOIT. MICH., August 7.?
Charles K. Hughes, Republican candi
date for President, in the first .set
spcccli of his transcontinental trip, t o
night assailed the administration vig
orously ifor Mexican policy, for
appointing men whom he termed ??i? x
perlenccd to diplomatic posts, anil for
what he charactas a "rai'l upon
i the -civil service of the United States."
"Ho kept ns <i ;t of war," Mr. Hughes
| said, ref? rrintr to the President and a
Democratic campaign slogan, "yet we
seized Vera Or:;/ That was war, very
itrnoble war. Ar 1 it was war over the
liodicH of those dead soldiers. It was
called a war of service.
! "Talk about what Is your policy!
What Is the President's policy? I toes
any one know? Has the executive
ever had a policy for more than six
months on the Mexican question? 1
repeat: Who knows to-day what the
policy 'if the administration will b?j
three months hence? The trouble is
that this administration has written
such a record ttii" no matter what It
savs, you do not know whether it will
stick to it.
, says hi: is rn.i.r.i) with
iikki* sf.nsk of siiamk
"We have had an exhibition during
th" past three y-.>rs which, 1 confess,
tills n'? with a deep s'-nse of shame.
I I have not a particle of militaristic
spirit In my system, hut if I tun eloct'-d
President 1 will see to it that Amer
ican riuh'rf in Mexi-o are respected."
Mr. Hushes assailed the administra
tion's con!.- ? toward upholding Amer
ican rights abroad during the Kuro
pean war.
"When I say th.iJ I am an American
citizen." th' noir.ine?? said. "I ought to
: say the proudest thine that any man
| can say In this world, but you can't
have that pride if American citizenry
1 is a cheap tUinsr, if it is not worthy of
protection thi? wide world over. There
is no man who could successfully pre
sent to an American community the
platform that an American citizen's
rights stop at the coast line, and that
? beyond that American life is to be the
prey of any marauder that chooses
to take It."
The nominee cited the Republican
I platform's declaration that >:oc
ernment positions had been taken from
the operation of the civil service law
during the present administration, and
declared "thru sort of thine: has cot
, to stop."
He toid of an Instance where, he said,
an eminent scientist in the t'oast and
Geodetic .Survey, "a man of very emi
nent rank," ha I been "displaced to
make room for an excellent stock
breeder and veterinary surgeon."

The Federal Trade Commission. Mr.
Hughe* charged, "was fairly emascu
lated by t he men. for the most part,
who werv appointed to places upon
it."
It was inexcusable. Mr. Hushes as
i sewed, for the administration to "take
j out. In country after country in l<atin
! America, where we have frequently
said we desired to cultivate the most
friendly relations, men in the diplo
! inatio service who "had represented
S the country with credit and put in men
utterly inexperienced."
j "Past administrations." ho said, "had
; sinned In that particular." but stand
! ards had been raised, and there were
men in our service of long experience
and fine training. Cither appointments
by the President were assailed.
Mr. Hughes also laid stress on what
| he termed the need for industrial
brotherhood and closer co-operation
between employers and employees,
i After his main address at Arcadia
i Hall. Mr. Hughes delivered a second
! address at the Light C.unrd Armory, in
i which he reiterated many of the state
i meats made in the first address.

| Mr. Hughes spent a strenuous day in
'the stifling heat of Detroit. He made
' six speeches between noon and 10
I o'clock to-night. The first talk of the
dav was addressed to about forty manu
facturers. interested In the social wel
| fare of their employees The second
was on suffrage, both being delivered
at ids hotel. <?ne hundred women heard
him repeat his declaration in New
York that be wanted the question

After lunch the nominee went to the
ball game, later visiting two of De
troit's big automobile factories and
addressing crowds at each on Indus
trial co-operation. Between speeches
he held many short conferences with
local political leaders, shook hands
with about 2,000 persons and managed
to find time for two short naps. He
left late to-night for Chicago.

Members of the trade" extension
bureau, of the Richmond Chamber of
Commer.ee, who have boon boosting the
festival week, are very much pleased
by the showing made the initial day.
The number of early arrivals is con
siderably ahead of the first day last
year, and when it is remembered that
more than 600 visited the .-ity then, there
is every reason to "expect a mammoth
crowd.

ing the opening day. "Already more
