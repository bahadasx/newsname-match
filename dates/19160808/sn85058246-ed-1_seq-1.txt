M dry farm grain la not as good as

R Is also very good and bids fair to be

The Yellowstone Highway commit
tee of tho Commercial Club Is much
I'leased over the largo amount of
tourist tratllc which has come through
Logan and Cache Vulley siueo June
1G. No exact record has been kept
but it Is estimated that over a thou
simd touring cars hao passed thru
the valley und Logun since the Park
opened. Most of tho curs have come
from all parts of the United Stutes.
Members of tho local committee
and others have conversed with ,liiiiny
of tint tourists und they are nil much
Impressed with beautiful Cache Val
ley and are glad they came this wny'
.'You have a beautiful ulley," arc
tho first words they say.
Recently a largo number of auto
mobile logs of the Yellowstone toute
by way of Cache Valley were placed
In all the garages and hotels In Salt
Lake City, Ogden and Brlglinm City,
Pocntello, Idaho Falls, Hexburg, and
other places to be given away to the
tourists bound to nnd from the lMrk.
Many of the garago and hotel peo
ple say they have culls cery day for
such logs mid they uro pleased to gel
them.
The local and committees In the
valley are to be commended for the
effort they hne put forth in bringing
the tourUt traffic our way. This 1
the result of good advertising, but
this fuct must not bo overlooked that
the best way to receive the benefit!
of this advertising to follow It ui
and Impress the tourist Is to have
good roads. No matter how beaull
ful the valley Is If the roads are bad
tho tralllo will not como. Good roadt

lion. In this respect tho valley has
made an excellent showing UiIh yeai

p. m. after a very pleasant rldo, with- ' M
out having an thing moro serious Hj
than a blowout. Very little walking , H
wbh done on tho way over, which was M
ccntrary to the belief of many people. H
The stay on the lake wns delight- ,H
ful. The boys spent their time In ' H
boating, swimming, games and fish- ;H
lng. They stnyed at Camp Snoozer. vH
which was christened two years ago H

was mndo In seven hours. H
Tho River Heights troop Is moro H
enthusiastic than over over the scout
work. They are planning to make a ,
permanent enmp on tlto south end ot '
1 the lake If nrrangetnonts can be
made At that place the shade Is
bettor and the beach cleaner than at
1 nny other place on tho lake. Tho -H
