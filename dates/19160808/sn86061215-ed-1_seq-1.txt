SUBMARINE OFF
May Be the Bremen Making
for Safety in Waters
of United States
ON THE SURFACE
FOR SHORT TIME
American Officials Say No
U. S. Submersible Is in
the Near Vicinity
Machlasport, Me., Aug. 7.—Capt
Small of the Cross island coast guard
station reported this morning that his
station had sighted a large submarine
bound west. ItB nationality could not
be determined but the captain said he
had no doubt that tt was an undersea
craft. The submarine was coming to
the surface when it was sighted and
after running awash fifteen minutes
again submerged. It was thought that
the vessel might be the German sub
marine Bremen. So far as can be
learned there are no U. S. submarines
on the Maine coast.
The lookout who sighted the subma
rine later said that he picked the ves
sel up in clear weather five miles to
the southwest. As the vessel came to
the surface the lookout said he heard
several blasts from the signal horn
at the lighthouse on Seal island, a
British possession.
It is believed the keeper of the light
house was signalling to the keeper at
Grand Manan light, also British owned,
that a submarine had been sighted.
Immediately after the whistle
sounded the submarine submerged. A
few moment later a haze set in and'
it was Impossible to see more than
four miles off Cross island..
May Be the Bremen.
Cross island lies close to the Maine
coast. If the vessel is the Bremen,
she was either oil her course or, for
reasons best known to the master of
the merchantman, had chosen to come
In close to the enemy's country in or
der to arrim«fKUUMfe«ftttMn the three
mile limit.
To be off Cross Island, the subma
rine must have skirted the coast of
Nova Scotia and rounded Sable island
thence heading north along the edge
of the Bay of Fundy instead of taking
the most direct route, crossed the Gulf
of Maine to Bar Harbor or Portland.
The indicated course would bring
her within the three mile limit soon
after she was sighted and from then
on she would have plenty of water to
permit her to keep within the neutral
zone.
Lowell W. Dunn, the lookout on
Cross island, later reported that he
had sighted a second submarine con
siderably smaller than the first one.
GERMAN AGENTS SILENT.
Baltimore, Md., Aug. 7.—Henry G.
Hllken, senior member of the Eastern
Forwarding Co., American agents of
the German merchant submarines,
read the Associated Press dispatch re
porting the sighting of a submarine oft
the Maine coast today with interest
but refused to comment on the possi
bility of the craft being the Bremen
or any other German underwater boat.
Officials of the company have said
heretofore that the Bremen was com
ing to Baltimore or some other con
venient American port on the Atlantic
seaboard and while it has been denied
that her destination was Boston, It
might be found expedient for her to
put into that port.
NO U. S. SHIP NEAR.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 7.—Navy of
ficers said today no American subma
rines were known to be anywhere in
the vicinity of Cross island. They
thought the boat sighted there might
be the Deutschland on her homeward
voyage or the Bremen bound in for
the United States.

TO RATIFY PACT.
New York, Aug. 7.—Efforts of May
or Mitchel and of Public Service Com
missioner Straus to settle the street
railway strike in New York failed to
day. After a protracted meeting the
directors of the New York Railways
Co. declined at this time to ratify the
tentative agreement proposed by the
two public officials as a basis for a
settlement.
Meetings of the union men and
of the board of directors of the rail
ways company were called at 11
o'clock today to consider proposals of

proved by President Shonts of the
company and by representatives of tho
Amalgamated Street and Electric Rail
way Employes of America.
Leaders of both sides promised to
recommend the proposals for ratifica
tion.
It was reported that the demands of
the strikers for a wage scale of thirty
to thirty-three cents an hour were
granted together with virtual, If not
official recognition of their union and
an agreement to the men's demand
that future differences between them
and the company should be submitted
to arbitration by a committee repre
senting the disputants.
The main contention of the conduc
tors and motormen has been for the
right to organize without Intimidation.
President Mahon of the Amalgamat
ed Association of Street and Electric
Railway Employes announced at the
close of the employes' meeting that
the tentative agreement had been rat
ified and that the men were ready to
go back to work if the agreement was
also ratified by the directors of the
New Yock Railways Co. The latter
at that-4iflje were still in session.

parently there was no change In the
running schedule of the lines of the
Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., which
operates the street railways.
Flynn said 1,800 of the 4,700 em
ployes had responded to the strike
order and that several lines were tied
up and others crippled. Strike break
ers had replaced the men out, he said.

Near Town of Floris
M. E. SMOKE HOUSE IS
TOTALLY DESTROYED
Blaze Thought to Have an
Incendiary Origin Won't
Take Brother's Body
Floris, Aug. 7.—Special: The town
of Floris had its full measure of thrills
within the past forty-eight hours with
a disastrous fire Saturday night which
was followed by the news Sunday
morning of a triple tragedy on the
Rock Island railroad in the vicinity of
Belknap, near here, where the mangled
forms of three men were picked up
along the track.
The fire alarm sounded at midnight
Saturday and drew a large crowd out
to see the blaze which was discovered
in the smoke house of the M. E.
church. The church bell was aug
mented by automobile sirens in giving
the alarm and the entire population
became a bucket brigade. The smoke
house Is located at the M. E. parson
age and by the efforts of the people
and a favorable wind, the loss of the
parsonage and other buildings nearby
was prevented. The smoke house and
its contents however, were entirely
consumed by the fire which is believed
to have been of Incendiary origin.
Killed on Tracks.
Sunday morning the people of Floris
awakened to another shock when
trainmen reported the body of a man
lying along the Rock Island tracks,
three miles south of here. Investiga
tion revealed that three instead of one,
had been killed. The tragedy occurred
where the railroad cuts through the
J. R. Swinney farm north of his resi
dence. It is believed that the men had
been walking along the track and be
coming tired sat down-.aod fell asleep
on the rails, meeting their death by
the first train which from appearances
was running east.
Coroner Heady, of Bloomfleld, was
called and removed the bodies to an
undertaking establishment there.
Two Are Unidentified.
Bloomfleld, Aug. 7.—Special: The
mangled forms of three men were
picked up on the Rock Island tracks
about three and one-half miles east of
Belknap Sunday morning and later
brought to this city where they are
being held by a local undertaker await
ing identification and directions for
disposal. One of the trio, a young
man of 18 years, who carried an iden
tification card giving the name of
Aleck Dougard, of Joliet, 111., was the
only one of the dead men whose iden
tity could be established.
The fireman on Rock Island train
No. 2 discovered a body alongside the
track and when the train reached Belk
nap notified the dispatcher there of the
discovery- Investigation was immed
iately made and three bodies were
found, all of which were considerably
mangled.
The verdict of the inquest does not
give the exact details of the killing
beyond stating that the three men
came to their deaths by being run
over by Rock Island train No. 2, near
Belknap.
Refuses to Take Body.
The local authorities immediately
following the finding of the identifica
tion card of young Dougard, tried to
get in, touch with his mother, whom
the card requests to be notified in
case of death, but was unable to locate
her. It was since learned that a broth
er, John Dougard, lives in Mexico, Mo.,
and he was notified, but refused to
have anything to do with the body,
telling the authorities to do as they
saw fit with it.
Sheriff Osa Dunlavy left today for
Mexico, Mo., to see the brother In
order to learn if any of the relatives
cared to take the body. Thus far the
remains of the other two men have not
been identified.

HUGHES OPPOSES
STRIFE BETWEEN
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE SAYS
AMERICAN EMPLOYES MUST
BE TREATED FAIRLY.
Detroit, Mich., Aug. 7.—Charles El
Hughes, speaking today to forty manu
facturers of Detroit and vicinity, em
ploying nearly 100,000 men, congratu
lated them upon what they had done
for the welfare of their employes, told
them that the democracy of the United
States would not stand for a continu
ation of "this alleged strife between
capital and labor" and declared that
the American workman should not be
regarded as a mere economic unit, but
as "a fellow worker, a human being."
Mr. Hughes' address was Impromptu
and followed a brief speech by J. M.
Eaton, spokesman for the manufactur
ers, who outlined the welfare meas
ures for employes taken by industrial
concerns here and suggested that the
nominee endorse a movement looking
to the formation of a national welfare
association of manufacturers. Mr.
Hughes said he regarded the sugges
tion "very favorably."
Portions of Address.
In his address to the manufacturers
Mr. Hughes said. In part:
"It Is an awful mistake to think of
the men through whose activity pro
duction is possible as mere economic
units. They are human beings. We
are all workingmen in this country.
We are in different spheres of activity
but we ought to have a sense of co
operation.
"In your welfare work you are but
tressing democracy. The human fac
tor Is after all the Important factor.
You may develop everything that goes
to make up the material side of pros
perity but you are absolutely hopeless
without the human factor and in
America, the land of free men, the
man who is at work for a living must
feel that the country Is doing the right
thing by him. He is entit)ed to be
safe in his work, to have every precau
tion taken against every sort of acci
dent that can be prevented.
"A man is put at \fork. How can he
refuse the Job which stands between
him and starvation? You have got to
protect him.
"We are not materialists In this
country we are all idealists but the
one thing that appeals to the working
man is the idea that he is equal to
some job in a first class way.
"We will get through with this old
strife between labor and capital.
Democracy can not stand it. We are
not laborers and capitalists in 'this
country, we are fellow citizens."
la For Suffrage.
Later, with his wife standing beside
him, Mr. Hughes spoke to a group of
suffragists. He reiterated his declara
tion in New York that the suffrage
question should be settled speedily by
giving the vote to women all over the
country. He added that he had formed
this opinion long ago, before he
thought the time would come when he
would have to announce his position
publicly.
HUGHES STARTS TOUR.
Detroit, Mich., Aug. 7.—Charles Ev
ans Hughes will open the 1916 presi
dential campaign here this evening
with two addresses. Arriving from
Niagara Falls shortly after 8 a. m., the
republican nominee had a busy day
before him. With a series of recep
tions, conferences with party leaders
—progressives as well as republicans
—a visit to Navin field to witness part
of a ball game, a tour of local automo
bile plants, a luncheon with newspa
per men and two speeches in the larg
est auditorium in the city, Mr. Hughes
faced a program that left him little
time that he could call really his own.
OF
FOR HIGH PLACE
Chicago, Aug. 7.—William R. Will
cox of New York, chairman of the
republican national committee, is in
Chicago today to open the national
headquarters for the western cam
paign and see that arrangements are
complete for tlie reception of Charles
Evans Hughes, who is to be here to
morrow.
Mr. Willcox was the guest of the
Hamilton club at its noonday lunch
eon.
The most important matter for con
sideration by Mr. Willcox was thp se
lection of a western chairman. Frank
H. Hitchcock, former postmaster gen
eral, seemed to be the most frequently
mentioned for the place, though today
John T. Adams of Iowa and A. T. Hert
of Kentucky were entered in the liBts.
Committeemen from middle western
states were in Chicago today to meet
Mr. Willcox. National committee head
quarters are already in operation.
