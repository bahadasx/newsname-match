mile front southeast of Lemberg, it was officially an

was captured. Tlumacz and the region east of the heights
along the Dniester ridge were taken. ,
Southwest of Kolomea-Stanislau railway, General
Leichisky's artillery silenced enemy guns. Russian caval
ry then swung into action and pursued the enemy forces,
fleeing disorderly. One Russian division captured 2,000
Germans, several heavy guns and many machine guns.

London, Aug. 8. Threatened with
enforced retreat from the strong Leip
rticr redoubt and the fortified village of
Tliiepvnl, the Germnns are making ev
ery effort to dislodge the Australians
from Hill 150, standing M0 feet above
the Pozieres-Thiepvnl highway.
A heavy bombardment of this sector
of the British front followed the re
prise of four German attacks in yes
terday's fightiug. The cannonading
was on last night an if in preparation
tit another drspernte Gcrmnn assault.
Documents found in German trenches
captured in the recent British advance

Several other Germans, whose letters

been unable to obtain food or drink.
One officer wrote that he had sent nn

Terrific Assaults at Verdun.
Paris, Aug. 8. German troops re
captured the strongly fortified Thiau
mont work northeast of Verdun. In a
most powerful assault early this morn
ing, it was officially announced at the
war office' today. A bloody battle is
still raging around the redoubt.
Following a night of terrific bom
bardment, the Germans directed five
most violent attacks against the French
positions from Flcury village to the
Thiaumout position. Very large forces
were employed in these attacks which
were continued, regardless of heavy
losses
At Floury village the Germnns were
completely repulsed, suffering heavily.

DAY OPENING
II
Made Six Speeches and
Shaved the Sp"eed Limit In
Tour of Detroit
PROVES HE IS NOT COLD
BY PERSPIRING FREEY
Despite Heat Sticks to His
White Vest and Favorite
Wing Collars
By Perry Arnold
(United Press staff correspondent)
Chicago, Aug. 8. Charles Evans
Hughes is out-Rooscvelting Roosevelt
in Btrenuosity of campaigning. Arriv
ing here today, the republican nominee
was fresh as a daisy alter a day in
Detroit that kept him on the jump, in
fiercely hot weather, from, early morn
ing to late at night, including six
sjteeehes and a breakneck bit of auto
mobile speeding around the town.
Moreover, Hughes seemed likely today
to achieve a new record iu Chicago for
stumpers.
Only one speech was scheduled at
the Coliseum, where back in June the
U. O. P. selected him as its candidate
but the nominee had to straighten
up factional muss between republicans
iu Illinois, was expected to put the
sea! of approval on a number of cam
paign measures for the western fight
formulated by National Chairman Will
cox and it seemed likely he would have
a great deal of handshaking to do.
He was slated forln conference with
Chairman Willcox. Alvin T llert nf
Kentucky, western campaign manager,
anu national committeeman. ..
At noon he was to hold an., open
handshaking reception in the rotunda
of a loot skyscraper.
To Speak at Coliseum -
This afternoon he will bo taken for
an automobile ride of Chicago's
boulevard system. Tonight he will ad
dress a mass meeting at the Coliseum.!
Mrs. Fred Upham; wife of the Illi
nois national committeeman formed the
head of a party of women who greeted
Mrs. Hughes. The candidate's wife
will have a busy day too.
Only just started in bis campaigning
for the highest office in tho land,
hughes today 'had Already . developed
an almost Rooseveltian vocabulary of
denunciation and of aphorism. Some
of his epigrams coined so far are:
"The democratic party is a party
for votes only."
''The democratic party came up to
the protection tax like a skittish horse
approaching a brass band.
"We are entitled to t standing army
without taking men out of civil lite,
as in tiie Mexican mobilization, just
as much as a city is entitled to proper
police protection."
"The militarv problem is a problem
of good sense.''
"There's no danger of our going to
war unless the o'her side knows that
'we're too proud to fight'."
"The best way of making for effi
ciency is bv making for contentment."
Not "Cold" Just Now
It is a libel, this story that Hughes
is "cold." No human being could
have perspired any mere than the for
mer justice of the supreme court has
done since iie left Bridgehauipton on
Saturday for his first trial of presi
dential campaigning. Just the same
the nominee sticks to his white vest
aiuV the wing collars he affects. The
collars wilt and drop over, but Hughes
just grins underneath his beard by
the way, it was trimmed this morning
by one of the useful boys in the pri
vate car and now distinctly reveals
the grin and goes right niiead.
r.vervbodv with whom the nominee
comes in contact is interested in Mrs.
Hughes. The story from Itridgehatnp-
ton that she is carrying only one hat on
the trip was a base canard. It is re
liably stated that there are nt least
three. I'p to date Mrs. Hughes has
worn two different ones botii durk,
but tastv looking.
Mrs. Hughes is determined she will)
not accept social engagements during
the tour. The governor regards her
as one of his best advisors.
Is In Fine Trim
Wlien Roosevelt campaigned four
vears ago be took along a throat spe
cialist, a number Of boxes of lozenges
for hoarseness and a can or two of ox-
vgen for revival purposes, apparently.!
Governor Hughes lias a physician along
but there aren t any throat lozenges
nor any tanks of oxygen cluttering up
the rear platform of the private car.
He doesn t need tiiem. The former
governor has a remarkably clear voice.
licuig on the nencn for some time has
curtailed v his gestures considerably.
When he was governor of New York he
used to have unite a n amber of hand
swiugs to emphasize the points in his
addresses. Now his favorite one is a
sort of reversed uppercut into an out
stretched palm. He nsed it to ram
home most of the emphatic portions of
his .speeches, lie has very little else
in the way of air blows.

BERLIN ANNOUNCES
BREMEN WAS BUNS
Berne, Aug. ' 8. The Berlin
Tngeblatt announces . that the
German submarine Bremon,
which was to have arrived at an
American port, has been sunk
through an accident to her ma
chinery, according to a dispatch
received here this afternoon.

today : stating the super-sub-submarine
Bremen, sister ship.
- of the Deutschland had been
sunk, Henry H. Hilken, heal of
the Kastern Forwarding com-
fiany, local agents of the sub-sea
ine here said the report is ' ' pos
sibly true."

"the under sea line had no know

o
Harry Barron Hurries to
Head Off Both When They
Reach San Francisco .
Tncoma, Wash., Aug. 8. If the train
on which Harry Barron is hurry
ing southward reaches Ban Francisco
before the steamer Admiral Schley
docks there today, lively "doings"
will be in order, according to the prom
ise mnde by the Barron before depart
ing from Tacoma.
Aboard the steamer are William
O'Neill, a wealthy business man of
Oakland, and his daughter, Marie, who
also is Airs, riarron.
According to the story Barron told
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Thomp
son, fntner-in-iaw U'iNeill, a total
stranger to him, invaded his apartments
here, swatted the said Barron in the
eye and then there made off with the
bride.
Following this exciting episode, Bar
ron swonj ,ut a warrant for O'Neill is
arrest, charging the latter with the
larceny of a fbOO diamond ring which
Barron claims his wife gave him. Be
fore the warrant could be served, how
ever, O'Neill and his daughter had
boarded the Admiral Schley aad were on
their way to California.
Barron is said to have met Miss
O'Neill early in July. It was a case of
love at first sight for on July 10 they
were married in Aberdeen and shortly
after, came to Tacoma.
Nothing Heard from
Maine Submarine
Boston, Mass., Aug. 8. After nn all
night vigil by watchers along the coast
from Eustport to Bostoa, the antici
pated arrival of another German mer
chant submarine failed to materialize
early today. Following the report Of
Lowell W. Dunn, lookout at Cross Is
land, that ho had observed two sub
marines rise to tiie surface ami thea
submerge, the entire eoust of New Film
land was stirred to watchfulness.
It was expected that if Dunn's re
port was true, the mysterious craft
would have been seen ngam or turned
into n. port along the Muine const, it
was believed today.
Both f'ortsmoutll and Charlestown
navy yards were insistent that no
United States submarines were in
Muine waters ami u high official of
the IVure River Ship Yards declared
that there were no lirltish submarines
in Canadian waters that might stray
dwon the Maine const.
French Have New
and Deadly Shell
Fiiris, July 25. (l!y mail) A new
shell that breaks into two thousand
pieces when exploded has just been put
into service and is expected to give the
French artillerymen a leadership that
will probably not be overtaken in this
war. Whether the new explosives nre
being used in the Soinme offensive is
not known.
For months the French have been
exHriineuting to get a shell of the
highest fragmentation. This new shell
is believed to answer the problem.
"If you can get a piece of shell as
big as the point of a pin head into the
liver of an enemy soldier you've put
him out,' ' said a French artilleryman.
Karly in the war, the Germans seek
ing high fragmentation are believed
to have tried glass shells. The Ger !
mans, however, discovered that glass
was powdered by the high explosive
and rendered harmless as a missile.
DEAF MAN KILLED
I.a Grande, Ore., Aug. 8. Deafness
was ascribed today as the cause of A.
Nash being killed by a locomotive near
I.a Grande. Nash was walking between
the tracks when the train approached.
While the whistle shrieked and brakes
were applied, he strolled calmly ahead,
finally stepping squarely into the pnth
of the ccrushing engine.

No Strike at Present
New York, Aug. 8. Presidents of
the four railroad brotherhoods and rep
resentatives of the 2!.'5 railroads af
fected by the railway employes de
mands, met here today to listen to the
results of the so-called strifce vote, in
volving 400,000 men. it is generally
known more than ninety per cent of
the men have voted to strike unless
the deniunds for an eight hour basiu
day anil time and one half for over
time nre granted.
Hepresentatives of both employers
ami employes say there is little possi
bility of an immediate strike even
though the situation ts apparently
deadlocked. Although the Switchmens
Cnijn of North Ameri.:i asked for help
from the I'nited States board of medi
ation, officers of tiie four brotherhoods
have not taken kindly to any sugges
tion of government aid in arbitration.
Kenresentatives of the employes today
declared tho men were dissatist'id with
the recent awards of the arbitration
boards and not with the theory itself.1;
The employes have publicly announced
opposition to the proposal tliut the in
terstate commerce commissioa invnu-
gnte the controversy. It is contended
that the commission is not equipped io

Southern Pacific has notified all of its
