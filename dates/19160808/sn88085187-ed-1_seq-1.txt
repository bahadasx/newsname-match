650 In This City
If a general strike Is called by
the four great brotherhoods of
railway employes, it will directly
affect approximately 650 men in
Tacoma who operate trains out of
this city for the Northern Pnciflc,
Great Northern, Milwaukee, Ta
coma Eastern, and O. & W. lines.
It Is estimated that 500 of these
men are married und have homes
here.
Officials of the Tacoma lodges
of engineers, firemen, conductors
and trainmen have no definite
knowledge of the local vote on
the strike question, but declared
today that they believed 9 7 per
cent of Ihe men in this city had
voted to strike.
All Got a Vote.
All employes engaged in the
actual operation of trains, wheth
er they were members of the
brotherhoods or not, were allow
ed to vote. Only a small senti
ment was felt here against a
strike, and this sentiment wn
only shown among the older
men.
General estimates of the num
ber of Tacoma men affected by a
strike on the railroads today
showed that there are 120 en
gineers here, 150 firemen, 230
trainmen and 150 conductors.
Every railroad entering Taco
ma would be affected. The Cana
dian Pacific would he the onlY
road In the Northwest to escape
a tie-up, because it operates nl
most entirely through Canada,
and the Dominion government
will not permit a strike during
war times.

here, because the quantity fluc

The average dally would proba

It has been generally under
stood that the railroad men would
operate the fast through mail
trains In case of strike, but would
refuse to handle any other class
of trains.
Tacoma railroad employes ex
pressed an opinion Tuesday that
a strike was practically certain.
"I looks as though we will
have to cause a tie-up, In order
to win our point," said a union
official. "But we are prepared
for a long siege. If necessary."

From i member of .h.* railway brotherhood we get tins:
"The railway! don't expect to win the coming strike; they may
not even force us to strike They may grant our eight-hour-day de
mand! without a walkout. And then they'll use tlie fleet that they |
have shortened OUT hours as an argument tlint they have increased i
our wage! '25 per rent or more' and they'll demand a corresponding j
Increaae in freight <»r passenger ratea All their publicity now is tie
signed not to heat us trainmen, hut to heat the public afterward!" f
IS THIS THK REASON FOR THE RAILROADS' STRENU- |
OUB CAMPAIGN 'AGAINST THE DEMANDS OF THEIR KM- |
PLOYESI
Is the series of statements the railroads have given out intended |
to make the public believe they have given the men a much greater j
concession than they really have?
The roads have Just won a .. per cent Increase in freight rates, having asked a 10 I
per cent increase from the interstate commerce commission. II
Railroad profits ore larger now than ever before in recent years; the New York Ijj
Central this year, we are reliably informed, will make It.] per cent. (II
Locomotive engineers in "through" freight service now have an eight-hour day on (II
II per cent and firemen on 20 per cent of the mileage In the soutli; engineers on 5 per Mi
cent and firemen on I! per cent of the mileage west of the Mississippi. jil
The men do not demand excess wages in overtime as long hs the freight train main- !il
tains an average speed over the division of 11! V 4 miles an hour; so tlie railroads cannot lit
seriously contend that the brotherhoods' request would Involve a shortening of divi- |j|
sions to 100 miles each. jj]
W. Jett I.auck, railway economist, estimates Ihat additional outlay for an eight- j[|
hour day would he necessary on only L'O per com of the western roads for through jd
freight service, and this NOT at the penalized rale of overtime. ill
In view of these facts, doesn't it rather look as if the railroads
were raising their great hullaballoo not to keep their men's work
ing hours high, but to gouge extra freight tariffs out of the general
public?

President
to Accept
Mcx Issue
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 8.
—President Wilson will accept
Mexico as the campaign issue if
Republican Candidate Hughes and
his follows continue to indicate
they desire to fight for the presi
dency on this question.
This was the declaration of
those close to the president to
day.
President Wilson has agreed to
open the democratic campaign
around Sept. 1, regardless of con
gress. Sept. 2 has been agreed
upon as the date for Wilson's no_
tlflcation, but should it appear
evident that congress will con
tinue ln session until well Into
September, the president may
make his speech of acceptance the
last week in August.
This rallying call for the demo
crats is now practically complet
ed. The first draft has been made.
It will contain about 4,000 words.
Senator OUle James, who will
officially notify the president of
his renominatlon, will emphasise
the contention that a "united na
tion" salds behind the president.

county's si,.Mm -mini Jury
made its report Tuesday
noun nnd Ml dismissed by
.luilui- < aril.
It was called at tho request of
a "law und order" committee,
recommended by the prosecuting
attorney and directed by the
court to inquire nilo the strike
disorders.
Yet In the report t.l ore Is not
a word dealing with tho subject
for which it wag called. There
is not a hint of criticism.
Tlie report is confined to pub
lic institutions visited by the
grand jury in the last few days.
It declares the city jail a dis
grace to Tacoma and recommends
its complete abandonment and
tho building of a modern Jail.
"The city jail Is located in a
portion of the city hall, totally
unfit for jail purposes," it Bays
"it cannot be made sanitary and
is practically without ventila
tion."
It recommends that the wom
en's quarters in the county Jail
be enlarged and made more sani
tary. Also that the old building
for inmates on the county farm
be torn down and replaced with
a concrete structure-
Discussing the complaints of
unsanitary conditions at tlie Mil
waukee dock, the Jury says It
finds that "the conditions arc
nsuch as usually obtain in a ter-
porary camp."
The grand jury wn* called
.Inly 21.
Since then it has cost the
comity $75 a day at the low

alone was _♦»•"» I a day.
Four Indictments, each charg
ing rioting, were returned against
four striking longshoremen,
while 12 "no true bills" were re
turned, most of them exonerating
strikers from any responsibility
In the disturbances.
Deputy Prosecutor Phelps, who
has been directing the grand
jury work, had this to say:
"Although the strike situation
is not mentioned in the report,
the grand Jury has turned over
to the prosecuting attorney's of
fice some valuable information
concerning the strike and other
matters which we intend, to follow
up. The Jurors felt that it was
not necessary for them to take
the time for these matter^ and
