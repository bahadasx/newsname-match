Girls' Gingham and Percale
Dresses Under Price
"I always find the prettiest and most girlish styles in your store," said a mother the other day, and these are jnst such
dresses. That they are offered at reductions merely meana wo are desirous of a clearance. Excellent ginghams and per
cales in plaids, checks and plain colors, neatly trimmed and well made. Sizes 6 to 16.
We could not possibly buy these dresses at wholesale for the. price at which we offer them. But the insistent cry for
"something new'' compels us to close out the atoek now so we can have an entirely new assortment for the coming season
Mothers lose a splendid bargain opportunity who fail to see these attractive little frocks.
