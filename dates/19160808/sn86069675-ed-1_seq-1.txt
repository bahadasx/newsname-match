The
SITUATION IS
VERHERIOUS
Paper Shortage May Cause Large
Number of Newspapers to
Suspend Publication.
Tho shortage of white paper be
comes constantly more serious. It
is so serious that many of the larg
er nuwsjrajjcrs of the country whose
contracts for news print are nboir
expiring are threatened with the
danger of tho suspension of publi-
cation because of
cure, tho necessary
.inability to se
supply of news
print.
Under such circumstances there
was held in New York last week a
meeting of the publishers of that
city and of some of the larger o?
the Northern and Eastern cities.
One result was an agreement among
the newspapers of New York City
to cut down in tho size of. their
paper an amount equal to 12L pages
per week. This may help slightly
to relieve the pressure but there is
n demand for economy In the con
sumption of white pnper throughout
the United States. In spite of nl!
thnt can be done it Is reasonably
certain that white papur will bring
it much higher price next year
than newspnpors are now paying
where they hnve contracts made a
the beginning of this year.
It is well enough for the patrons
of newspapers to updrsfand whn?
is going on in tho market of one
of the products that enters large
ly into the tfd'stJ of newspnper pro
'drtetion: It is inevitable that news
papers mustflndome way nex?
year for an k$ri.?e in their reve
nue. Homo grown water melons and

FIELDS WINS
EASY RACE
Big Congressman from Carter Coun
ty Wins Over Riley, of Rowan,
and Hiles, of Bracken.
Congressman W. J. Fields again
has demonstrated that as a vote
getter he is in a class by himself.
Two years ago he won by a very
large majority nnd again on Sat
urday of this month he won by a
splendid margnin. He was opposed
by Judge J. W. Riley, of Rowan,
nnd J. B. Hiles, of Bracken, two
very strong men. Mr. Fields ran n
remarkable race in this county,
winning by 271, while two yenrs ago
he won by 102. There was little
interest taken in the primary among
the Democrats nnd n very light
vote was polled.
In the Republican ranks thero
was considerable feeling manifest
ed nnd quite a hot fight between
the Kirk and Willis men was had,
Kirk carrying the county by GO
votes, and from the Intest reports
he seems to be the winner in the
Appellate Judges' race. Kash car
ried the county over Pennington for
tho Republican nomination foi
Congress but it looks like Penning
ton will be the Republican .standard-bearer
this fall. The election
passed off quietly, there being no
disturbances of any character r.
ported.

STILL BUSY
Investigating Committee Appointed
By the City Council Has Not
Finished Labors.
The committee composed of At
torney R. G. Kern, Judge It H.
Winn and Mayor C. K. Oldham, ap
pointed by the City Council to in
vestigate the cost of erecting nnfi
maintaining a municipally owned
electric light and power plant hns
not yet completed its investigations.
The committee has visited More
head, Nicholasville nnd Harrods
burg nnd in those cities it found
thnt the city was getting its light
free; the commercial lighting being
sufficient to pay nil necessnry run
ning and upkeep expenses besides
mnking n little money for the city.
It nlso found that the commercing
rate charged was not as high as is
now being pajd here. When the
committee has completed its inves
tigation it is thought it will bo
submitted to the people to vote on
the proposition.
Winchester will shortly submit to
the voters of that city the ques-
htion 0f whether or not the city will
own its own water plant.
