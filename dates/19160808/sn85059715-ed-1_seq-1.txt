BID SHORTAGE!
US TOWERS
Observer of Things as They
Transpire Does a Sum in
Subtraction.
DEMMIES AT THE SHORT END
Candidates Fall Away Behind
Those on Republican
Primary Ticket.
CHARLESTON, August 8?"Just I
how much of a Democratic yegr is
this year ol Christian history,
1916," said an Observer of
Things as They Transpire, as he un-j
folded a sheet of paper and prepar- j
od to elucidate ror the benefit of a
small circle of Democratic men and J
brethren.
"Figures don't lie," said a follower
of the flag of Wilson, Cleveland 1
and Buchanan?also Bill Bryan of
the rlyei; l'latte. "ho let us m-m i
the worst."
"With much pleasure," said the
Observer of Things, etc. 'Let us take
the head of the ticket. Note the de-;
tails of tlie tale the figures tell.
Mow Corawcll Rim.
"There were three Democratic candidates
for the governorship?Cornwell,
French and Hogg. Cornwell,
tin: successful candidate, polled in
all the precincts of the state over
35.0(10 votes; French, who ran next
to the winner, polled over 10,000,
and Hogg, who ran behind the other
two candidates, got over 1 2,000.
That Is a total, in round numbers, of
more than 07.000 votes?in exact
numbers, nearly 7U.OOO, or 67,790.
"So much for that. While the
Democratic candidates, three in number,
were polling this sixty-odd thousand
votes the two Republican candidates
were getting nearly 120,000
in exact numbers. 59,865 votes for
Robinson, and 59,327 votes for Lilly |
?a total of 119,182; and that, my I
beloved brethren, gives ithe result
that 51,392 more Republicans than
Democrats voted on the governorship
in the June primaries.
"Of course, this was in June, and
the November election is to come, but
reasoning men whose minds run to
figures do not expect a change oi'i
more than 50,000 votes in the next1
couple of months.
And Chilton, Too.
"And note these figures, too. William
E. Chilton was the Democratic1
(candidate for the United States Sen-,
atorship. He received 59,954 votes,;
! while four Republican candidates for 1
the nomination for the same eliice
(received 104,286 votes. Do a little
subtracting, and you will find a
couple of things of interest to those
politically inclined?
"First, that William E. Chilton.
. ' i l /-M.ll
idol of his parly, supported uy wr
ton, MacCorkle and Chilton, Clyde
needier Johnson and others, polled
14,:;:!2 fewer votes than the Republican
candidates, and?
'Secondly, that William E. Chilton,
idol, etc., not only ran nearly
4 5,000 behind these Republican
candidates but that he ran nearly
S.OOO votes behind the candidates of
his own party for the governorship.
Not a phenomenal run for a party:
: idol, eh. fellers?
"But -.ve pass that up, for it grows j
worse further on. 1 haven't time to
go into great detail now, but if you
fellows think you are so many in this
state of West Virginia, you ought to j
go lo the figures.
"C. R. Wilson, Democratic nominee
for secretary of state, polled 42,230 i
fewer votes than the Republican
candidates; Rinehart, nominee for
state treasurer, ran 42,525 behind; |
A. K. Kenney, aspiring for the audit-j
orshlp over John S. Darst, lacked 44,019
votes of being abreast of the
candidates on the Republican ticket,
li. A. Armstrong, candidate for the
nomination for state superintendent
of schools, trailed nearly 40,000 j
votes behind Shawkey and Murray,;
Republican candidates, and J. B. Finley,
Democratic candidate for commissioner
of agriculture, ran only a
small Item of nearly 70,000 behind:
I Stewart and Williams!"
Democrats Short Crop.
"From all of which," remarek i
a disciple of the lamented Jefferson. I
"I tukc it that you figure that Democrats
are not over plentiful in this;
I ?
j Hi'Mill I II 1 II LUIIIUlUUITCiVlui.
"\ou take It 'luito well," said the \
Observer, "and indeed very accuI
ratoly. Democrats are not a long
| crop in West Virginia this year, and
the harvest is going to be a short
j crop ot Democratic votes in the genI
eral election in November. Old GenI
eral Pan!;, also, is leading the greater
i number of those who voted in the
! Democratic primary, and that is
'adding nothing that you tan notice
j to the chances for anything upjproachirg
Democratic success.
"If you fellows will come around
hero some day when I have plenty of
' time to spare, I will go Into the flgJ
uros front individual counties, and
