RED TRAIL
Travelers Going Other Ways to
Evade Ruts on Burleigh
County Stretch.
EASTERNERS DECLARE
ROAD IMPASSABLE
Tractors and Graders Bunched,
Can't Make Needed Repairs
to Advantage.
The Burleigh country stretch of the
National highway is the worst on the
entire course of the Red Trail, accord­
ing to tourists and to BiBmarck citi­
zens who have traveled over it.
Many sections of the road are im­
passable. Big ruts, two to three feet
deep, waylay the cars and cause
many accidents. For the large tour­
ing machines traveling is virtually im­
possible and tourists have been evad­
ing it wherever possible and going
through other towns and cities rather
than Bismarck.
Nebraskan Expresses Himself.
A man touring through from Ne­
braska to the Yellowstone Park yes­
terday expressed the views of most
of the men who have traveled over it,
when he declared that it is the most
treacherous piece of road he has ever
traveled on at this season of the year.
Possibly the worst part of the road
Is from the Field farm to Menoken.
It is just one hole after another.
There is no way that the driver can
escape them.
Boosters Aroused.
Capital City boosters are aroused
over the condition. It insures a
knocker for the city and Burleigh
county for every tourist that passes
over the National highway.
MoBt of those interested in good
roads believe that the bad conditions
-are'due -te the fact that-the tractors
and "graders tuts year are bunched
and have, therefore, not been able
to do as satisfactory work as last
year.'..
Back on Work.
Only 50 miles of work have been
graded to date, while the equipment
has been increased by two graders
and an engine. Some-2&0 miles were
worked last year.
Men in charge of the work say,
however. that the delay has been due
to the inability to get men to dig out
the rocks, consequently the crews
must be taken from the graders and
engines to do do the work, allowing
the equipment, valued at $17,475, to
remain idle.
Get in the Way.
Those that favor having only one
outfit in each place urge that this
method would not permit them get­
ting in each other's way, one rock
wouldn't delay the whole string.

SAYS HUGHES
Republican Nominee Opens Cam­

ous Speech.
HAS NOT KEPT
NATION OUT OF WAR
Cites Vera Cruz Incident and
Calls It Very "Ignoble
War."
Detroit, Mich., Aug. 7.—Charles E.
Hughes in the first speech of his trans­
continental trip tonight assailed the
administration vigorously for i,ts for­
eign policy its Mexican policy for
appointing men, whom he termed in­
experienced, in diplomatic .posts, and
for what he characterized as "a raid
upon the civil service of the United
States."
"He kept us out of war," Mr.
Hughes said, referring to the presi­
dent and the Democratic slogan. "He
seized Vera 'Cruz that was war—very
ignoble war. And it was called war
pver the bodies of those dead soldiers
it was called a war of service."
What is His Policy.
"Talk about what is your policy.
What is the piesident's policy. Does
anyone know? Has the executive ever
had a policy for more than six months
on the Mexican question? I repeat.
Who knows today what the policy of
the administration will be three
months hence? My friends, the trou­
ble is that this administration haB
written such a record that no matter
what it says, you do not know wheth­
er it will stick to it."
"We have had an exhibition during
the past three years which, I confess,
fills me with a deep sense of shame.
I have not a particle of militaristic
spirit in my s^teta b*t,~if I am-elect­
ed 'president, I will see to -it that
American rights in Mexico are re­
spected."
Attacks Diplomacy.
Mr. Hughes assailed the administra­
tion's course in upholding American
rights abroad during the European
war.
"'When I say that I am an American
citizen," the nominee said, "I ought
to say the proudest thing that any
man can say in this world. But you
can not have that pride, if American
citizenship is a cheap thing if it is
not worthy of protection this wide
world over. There is no man who
could successfully present to any
American community the platform
that an American citizen's rights stop
at the coast'line and that beyond that
American rights are to be ignored by
any marauder that choses to do so."
The nominee cited the Republican
platform declaration that 30,000 gov­
ernment positions have been taken
from the operation of the civil service
law during the present administration
and declared that "that sort of thing
has got to stop."
TO LAUNCH WILSON

er congress still is in session then,
was reached today between President
Wilson and Vance C. iMcCormick,

tee's vice chairman.

fication ceremonies, Chairman McCor

dent will go to Shadow Lane, N. J.,
for the occasion and return immed­
iately afterward to Washington.
HAIL CAUSES MUCH
DAMAGE TO CROPS
SOUTH OF HAZELTON
Hazelton, N. D., Aug. 7.—A disas­
trous hail storm visited the country
nine miles southwest of town, .wiping
out some crops completely and de­
stroying others only partially. The
storm seemed to be about a mile in
width and swept a considerable dis­
tance* in length. The greatest dam­
age was reported from the L. H. Koon
farm. The crop there is a total loss.
Other losses reported are as follows:
Henry Seir, partial loss Chris Mer
kel, O. Wassen, Chas. Wagner and E.
Caulfield all sustained partial crop
losses.
From this locality the storm went
down into the Horsehead valley, but
reports as to what damage was done
there have not been learned.

SHOULD PROMOTE
DAIRY INTERESTS
The comparatively light crop of
wheat this yeiar will ultimately result
in a benefit to the state.
This is the belief of R. F. Flint,
state commissioner of agriculture and
labor.
"Interest in livestock will be ac­
tively renewed throughout North Da­
kota as a resultiof the unusually poor
crop conditions," says Mr. Flint.
"Wheat farmers are actively thinking
along that line right now, but the
person who tries to Ml them so had
better first Plan a -getaway.
al­
ready as to where breeding animals
may be purchased in car lots, but the
requests are coming from business
men.
"As a matter of fact, it has been
easier to sell an automobile through­
out North Dakota, so far this sum*
mer, than, a cream separator. Many
of the cows would have gone dry and
the cream separator been removed to
the shed to rust in companionship
with the buggy, if the young folks had
realized their wish. Frequent rains,
however, kept the pasture in excel­
lent condition and bossy just could
not quit giving milk.
"Beef cattle, too, have made a re­
markable development. Most stock,
because of a long, cold winter, were
unusually thin this spring. Grass was
late in starting, but. made a wonderful
growth, is ripening early, and North
Dakota can be depended on, this fail,
for some of the best conditioned range
stock we have shipped.
"When one considers how much less
subject to disease grass and some
other forage crops are than wheat,
and how stock can feed successfully
even after a hail storm has put a
grain crop out of the running it ought
to cause us to look more favorably
upon the cloven-hoofed farm animals.
"On the large farms the labor prob­
lem is, of course, a difficult one to
solve. On the other hand, ranch help
—cowboys—are a reliable class of
men, remaining for years with the
same employer. The steady employ­
ment is a part of the answer.
"Eastgate Brothers, at Larimoro,
maintain that they have produced
from 50 to 260 pounds of beef per
acre from pasture. Butterfat and
meat are both bringing good prices.
There is, however, nothing gained
arguing with a man of the advantages
of producing stock when it is against
his will. We are all like children
when we get a severe bump we know
where to go without any argument.
In the farmer's case, it is to diversi­
fied farming.

no longer be used within the city
limits, and hereafter offenses will
mean arrest and trial in the police

IS Expidited.
Dickinson, N. D., Aug. 7.—Frank
Lang, who was convicted this morn­
ing in the Mott court of the murder
of L. H. Larson, a farmer living two
miles from Regent, was sentenced
this afternoon to life imprisonment
at the state penitentiary.
Dune McGillis, state transportation
agent, is expected on No. 1, to bring
the prisoner to Bismarck.
Arrested at Dickinson.
Lang' was arrested Friday evening
at Dickinson. He was brought back
to Mott for trial and then returned
to Dickinson to receive sentence.
According to Lang's story, he and
Larson were enroute to a hay field,
when they quarreled over the use of a
whifflertree. Lang claims Larson hit
him over the head with a rock and
called him ugly names. In the fight
that ensued, Lang is said to have ad­
mitted grabbing a scale weight, lying
on the wagon and crushing Larson's
skull.
Both on Hayrack.
Both were on the hayrack at the
time, and as they fought, the team
ran away, Larson's body being thrown
from the rig. Lang returned to Lar­
son's body, tied the hands and feet,
so he couldn't give an alarm, the
prisoner maintaining that he didn't
know Larson had been killed.
SME IS OFF
Both Sides Make Concessions in
Threatened New York
Tie-Up.
New York, Aug. 7.—The strike on
the surface railway lines here, which
threatened to extend to the subways
and elevated systems and thus com­
pletely tie up transportation facilities
in Greater New York, virtually came
to an end tonight.
Directors of the New York Railway
company and the. Third Avenue Rail­
way company, the two principal lines
affected, voted after being deadlocked
12 hours, to accept a plan proposed by
Mayor Mitchel and Mr. Strauss, chair­
man of the public service commis­
sion, after representatives of the
strikers had agreed to it. It was then
announced that normal service would
be resumed tomorrow on the lines
which ratified the agreement.
One of the chief concessions in the
settlement gives to the employes the
right to organize, which was the issue
the strike leaders said they were de­
termined should be fought to the end.
Farm Loan
Board Is
Organized
Washington, Aug. 7.—Organization
of the new farm loan board, which is
to administer the new rural credit sys­
tem, was perfected here today with
the induction into office of its four ap­
pointed members, the designation by
President Wilson of an executive head
and the selection of a secretary. The
board will meet again tomorrow to
consider how it may best obtain in­
formation on division of the country
into twelve districts with a federal
land bank in each.
President Wilson named George W.
Norris as farm loan commissioner, or
executive head of the board. The
oath of office was administered to Mr.
Norris, C. E. Lobdell, Herbert Quick
and W. S. A. Smith, the other appoint­
ive members, in the office of Secretary
McAdoo, who is ex-officio member and
chairman. Mr. McAdoo made a brief
speech, ipointing out that the farm
loan act was the first legislation to
provide financial aid for farmers on
long time and easy terms and declar­
ing it meant more prosperity for the
farmer and everybody else.
W. W. Flannagan of Mt. Claire, N.

Calls were received during the first

T. L. Stanley, federal labor agent, who
is in charge of the bureau, opened
his desk last Monday noon.
Reports indicate that there are
plenty of men in the southern part of
the state. Mr. Stanley therefore ad­
vises men seeking work to go to the
northern and western sections.
"I have been in touch," declares the
federal agent, "with the federal labor
agent in South Dakota, who is sending
men into these localities, but there
are not enough men to fill the demand.
"The wages vary from $3 to $3.30
for day labor and $5 and $5.50 for
teams. The length of time with which
employment is promised varies from
46 to 75 days.
