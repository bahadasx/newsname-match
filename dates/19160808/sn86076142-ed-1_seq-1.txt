HEAVY VOTING
THIS AFTERNOON
PRIMARIES DO NOT DRAW WELL
DURING EARLY HOURS
OF DAY
Voting was light in the early hours
of the day, owing probably to the fact
that the working miners had no op
portunity to cast their ballots before
going to work at 7 o'clock and there
fore were compelled to do their
voting after coming off shift at 3:30
o'clock. This fact did tyot seem to
impress the new voter, who was
dilatory In getting around to the
polls until late In the afternoon, when
the election officials expected there
would be a rush that would keep
them busy to the time of dosing. At
1:30 o'clock this afternoon the total
number of votes cast was 414 out of a
total registration of 1614. At 11 a. m.
