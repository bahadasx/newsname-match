East Casts Bigger Strike Vote
Than West.
Nf York. Aug. 8. The 400.000
railway employes of the country
engineers, conductors, tlremen ana
trainmen today through their chiefs
of their four brotherhoods, placed be
fore the managers of the railroads,
the Question as to whether the reads
were willing to grant their demands
for an eight-hour day and time and a
half pay for overtime or submit to a
strike. The result of the strike vote
taken among the employes during the
last month was presented to the nar
tlonal conference committee of rail
road managers and showed that an
overwhelming majority was in favor of
authorizing their chiefs to call a strike.
The railroad managers gave no defi
nite antnver to the renewed demands
f.f the men today and it was agreed to
adjourn until tomorrow morning to
give the managers time for .further
discussion. A. B. Garretson, president
of the Order of Railway Conductors,
notified the managers that the time
for parleying was over unless the roads
were prepared to present a modified
proposition.
"If you are ready to prepare
modified proposition," said Mr. Gar
retson, "we are ready to discuss it."
Words Are Handled.
Elisha Lee, for the railroads said:
"I am not going to answer your
Questions now in a definite fore. I
will take them up with the managers,
together with the result of the strike
ballet and all that appertains to it.
Whether we have a pioposition will
develop by our own discussion."
Mr Garretson interrupted to say, "I
want you to bear in mind that your
comm'ttee has not once brought us
anything resembling a definite propo
sition." Each union head presented his fig
ures in different form. W. S. Stone,
for the engineers, reported 98.17 per
cent in favor of a strike In the south
eastern district, 90.35 per cent in the
western and 94.64 per cent in eastern.
W. S. Carter, for the fireman and en
ginemen, reported that out of a total
of 70.653 cast including nonunion men
and employes on roads not represented
in the conference, 98.04 per cent were
in favor of a strike.
W. G Lee. for the trainmen, re
ported that of a total of 129,108 votes,
124.832 favored a strike, with 1,400
votes still to be heard from.
Only 84 Per Cent Is Western Vote.
A. B. Garretson, of the conductors,
reported 84.03 per cent affimative in
the western district, 84.08 in the east
ern and 93.04 in the southern district,
34.846 votes cast. The managers ob
jected to the inclusion in the figures
of the vote on roads not represented in
the conference but were informed by
the union heads that the four broth
erhoods were fighting for every rail
road employe throughout the country
as a matter of principle. They insist
ed on including these figures.
The managers also asked if the vote
by individual railroads would be
phown but in reply to this the brother
hood chiefs said that if the roads were
willing to make public the returns on
the vote taken some time ago by the
roads themselves among their em
ployes, the unions would gladly fur
nish their figures.
Only the ratification of agreements
by street car employes of three lines,
one in Richmond, one in Queens and
ore in Manhattan, was awaited to
complete the s?ttlement of New York's
traction strike this afternoon. This
announcement was made by Mayor
Mitchel, who asserted that within a
few hours the agreements would be
ratified by the car men at three sep
arate meetings during the day.
Representatives of both employers
and employees say there is little pos
sibility of an immediate strike even
though the Mtuation is apparently
deadlocked. Although the Switchmen's
Union of North America asked for
help from the United States board of
mediation and conciliation, and have
agreed to submit their demands to
arbitration, officers of the four rall
way brotherhoods have not taken

ARMY BILL 1ASSES
Senate Adopts Measure Appropriating
$167,000,000 for Defense.
Washington, Aug. 8. With most of

BUSY PROGRAM ARRANGED
Crowning Event to Be Speech
at Coliseum Tonight.
Some Factional Strife to Iron
Out in Chicago.
BY PERRY ARNOLD.
Chicago, Aug. 8. Charles Evans
Hughes is out-Roosevelting Roosevelt
in strenuosity of campaigning. Arriv
ing here today, the Republican nomi
nee was fresh as a daisy after a day
in Detroit that kept him on the jump
in fiercely hot weather, from early
morning to late at night. Moreover,
Hughes seemed HKely today to achieve
a new record In Chicago for stumpers.
Only one speech was scheduled at
the Coliseum, where back in June the
G. O. P. selected him as its candidate
but the nominee has to straighten
out a slightly tangled factional muss
between Republicans in Illinois. It
seemed likely he would have a great
deal of handshaking to do.
He was slated for a conference with
Chairman Willcox, Alvin T. Hert, of
Kentucky, western campaign manager
and national committeeman.
At noon he was to hold an open
handshaking reception in the rotunda
of a loop skyscraper.
This afternoon he will be taken for
an auto tour of Chicago's boulevard
tystem. Tonight he will eddress a
mass meeting at the Coliseum.
Women Represented.
Mrs. Fred Upham. wife of the Illi
nois national committeeman, formed
the head of a party of women who
greeted Mrs. Hughes. The candidate's
wife will have a busy day too.
Only just started in his campaign
ing for the highest office in the land
Hughes today had already developed
an almost Rooseveltian vocabulary of
denunciation and of aphorism-., Some
e-f his epigrams so far are:
"The Democratic party is a party
for votes only" -
"The Democratic party came uo to
the protection tax like a skittish horse
approaching a brass band'
"We are entitled to a standing
nrmy, without taking men out of civil
life, as in the Mexican mobilization,
just as much as a city is entitled to
proper protection."
"The military problem is a problem
of good sense."
"There's no danger of our going to
war unless the other side knows that
'we re too proud to fight'."
"The best wayof making for ef

from thirty counties. These reports
indicate numerous changes in the re
turns sent to Topeka by telephone and
telegraph. Reno county's report
sent to. Topeka by Associated Press is

Baiton. counties. Dyer has increased
his vote in Leavenworth. Gove and
Smith counties. Other counties have
reported changes, but not until these

Organ, 485; Knapp, 838. The county
was carried: Dyer, 260; Organ, 466;

turns have not been received by the
secretary of state and are not carried
in the total giving Dyer a 299 plural
ity over Knapp.
Complete returns from all counties
may not be received in- Topeka until
the latter part of the week. Unless a
decided change is made In some of
the counties which have sent their re
turns to the secretary of state, the of
ficial count may be required to settle
the dispute.
Doctor Harding Won't Give In.
Dr. Eva Harding, the Sunflower
state's "fighting woman," would not
admit today that the Rev. H. J. Cor
wine has beaten her tor the Demo
cratic nomination for congress in the
First district. Corwine claimed the
nomination by about two hundred
votes.
"I don't know whether I have been
nominated or not," Doctor Harding
said. "If I have been nominated I ex
pect to be elected, Dan Anthony not
withstanding. It makes little differ
ence to me whether I fight for the
right of women and children in Wash
ington or in Kansas.'
Doctor Harding doesn't like to cam
paign. "I like a tangible scrap; something
I can dig right into, like fighting for a
children's park in Topeka. A cam
paign scrap doesn't seem to me to be
that kind of a scrap," she declared.
"If Anthony is a real good politician
and I have been nominated, he will
refuse the Republican nomination and
make it unanimous for the woman
candidate a compliment to Kansas
women and suffrage," Doctor Harding
said.

The victory was the greatest ever
won by the union. It was the third
big victory in three big cities in a little
over three years. The other triumphs
were in Boston and Chicago. Where
extreme violence marked the Boston
affair, the peaceful victory won a year
ago in Chicago was exceeded in order
liness by the New York triumph.

the public service commission were re
sponsible for the settlement. They
called session after session with op
posing leaders until peace resulted.

to be chosen by Straus.

The mercury at 2 o'clock had fallen

Temporary relief from the hot
; weather came last night. Tonight thi

continue to rise tomorrow. The fore

heart," calls for generally fair weather
tonight and Wednesday; warmer in
the northern part of the state tonight
i and in south and east Wednesday- Last
night was the coolest night in Topeka
. since July 25 and the mercury today
climbed more slowly than it did yes

degrees, according to S. D. Flora, local
weather observer.
The minimum temperature reading
this morning was a fraction of a de

from going sky high, says Mr. Flora.
The latter part of August is ordinarily
7 degrees cooler than the first part,
but this year it is thought that Kansas
is doomed to a long period of real

Last year and for three or four
years previously the county needed
more money in the general revenue

valuation last year of $S8,76,28 the
best the commissioners could do for
the general revenue fund was a levy
of $0,122 on the i00 valuation. ' f
The law provides that In counties
where the total valuation is not less
f an 880.000,000 and not more than
891,000,000 the commissioners may
levy not more than $0,130 on the $100
valuation. The commission, this year,
will go the limit for the general reve
nue fund. In order to do so It will be
necessary to cut down on other funds.
The commissioners have concluded
that the road and bridge fund an
stand a cut in view of all the work
that was done last year.
Less for Charity.
A small cut will be made in he levy
for charitable institutions. The levy
for the state fair end for bonds and
interest fund will remain the same.
An cddltional expense this year will
be the judgment rendered against the
county In favor of the city of Topeka
in which it was held that the county
owes tne city tzi.vuo in penalties col

but with the Increased valuation the
commission will be able not only t
have a Digger general revenue fund
but to pay at least a third of the city
ludgment. It is my belief that tha
commission will be able along in Nim
vembar to set aside about $5,000 with
which to carry out the provisions of
the mothers' pension act." : 5
