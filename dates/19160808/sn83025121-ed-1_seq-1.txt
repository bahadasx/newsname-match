Republican Candidate For Pres
idency Takes Democratic Ad
ministration To Task For Fail
ing To Uphold American Rights
CAPITAL AND LABOR
MUST GET TOGETHER
Foreign Relations Under Bourbon
Rule' Are Disgraceful Because
President Fails To Grasp the
Questions and Regulate Them
(Associated Phm by Federal Wireless)
DETROIT, August 8. Char lei Ev
an Hughes, Bepubliean candi
date for the Presidency, mado
the Brat set speech of bis transconti
nental campaign yesterday, and re
peated it last night. He attacked the
Wilson administration, declaring that
the administration's policy in regard
to the Mexican question and other for
eign affairs may be a good one, but, as
no one at home or abroad knows what
if, is, no one is able to say.
In the afternoon, before a large audi
ence of manufacturers here, Mr.
.Hughe touched upon the labor ques
tion, and told hit hearers that the need
for industrial brotherhood between em
ployer and employed was never greater
in. the history of the' country. He re
ilemcd that statement in. the address
he made last- rgtrf-tlBBrniOTy.
Workassn Hare Right .
He declared that "tha' democracy of
this country will not much longer coun
tenance a continuation of the strife be
tween capital and labor." He added
that the American workman, should
' ' not be regarded as a mere economic
unit, but as a fellow worker and fellow
human being."
Mr. Hughes was in good voice for
both addresses, and was enthusiastical
ly received.- He was given an ovation
in the armory at night, the huge crowd
frequently interrupting him with
cheers.
The foreign policy otf Wilson came
in for most of the attacks leveled at
the administration by the Bepubliean
candidate. Especially he made scath
ing denunciation of what he called the
"raiding of the eivil service of tbr.
United States, by the appointment of
inexperienced men to diplomatic and
consular posts at a time when the coun
try's greatest need was men thoroughly
familiar with their duties."
Mexican Situation Bungled
Turning to the President's handling
of the Mexican problem, Mr. Hughes
declared that it was impossible to tell
what Mr. Wilson wished to say or to
do in regard to Mexico, for his atti
tude had shifted so constantly and
with such rapidity in the last three
years that no one could assert defi
nitely where the administration stood.
It was then that he asked a question
that brought out a volley of cheers.
"Has anyone any idea of what the
President's policy may bet Has the
chief executive of this nation baa any
Mexican policy longt? than six
months?
American Will Get Protection
"If I am elected President of the
United utes I shall make It my busi
ness and the government's business to
see to it thut Americans in Mexico get
the protection for themselves and their
legitimate business interest they are
entitled to from their own country and
the officials they have put in office.
"I toll you that the exhibition the
administration, has made of itself and
of the country, during the last three
years has mused me the deeest sense
of shame. ' '

NEW: PAPER METHOD
Royal Testing Station Uses Cot
ton Stalks As Material
(Associated Press ly rsdsral Wtrslsss.)
BERLIN, August H. It was announc
ed here yesterday that the royal test
ing station at Gross I.irhterflelde has
discovered a method of manufacturing
paper from cotton stalks. This dis
covery is of minor importance in Ger
many, it was pointed out here, but of
considerable importance to the United
States.
PRINCIPLES INVOLVE BULK
The department of Agriculture has
issued a number of bulletins upon the
manufacturer of paper from cotton
stalks. There has been little difficulty
in evolving of a method for ntilising
this material, but the difficulty has
been one of commercializing the pro
cess. Cotton stalks sre light in weight
but bulky. The problem has been to
concentrate a sufficient quantity at any
one place to make the construction ot
a plant for the manufacture of paper
by this means worth while.
