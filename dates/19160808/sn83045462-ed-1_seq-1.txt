brotherhoods placed before the j1
managers of the railroads the!'
* question as to whether the roads :
were willing to grant their demands
for an eight-hour day and 1
time and a half pay for overtime :
or submit to a strike.
The result of the strike vote (
taken among the employes dur- '
ing the last month was presented j1
to the national conference com- ;:
mittee of railroad managers and !1
showed that an overwhelming: '
majority were in favor of author- '
izing their chiefs to call a strike, i <
The railroad managers gave no j -i
definite answer to the renewed demands '
f \he men today, and it was agreed to.; *
adjourn until tomorrow morning to I
; ive the managers tin e for further disj.ision.
Time for Parleying: Over. Y
A. B. Garretson, president of the s
Order of Railway Conductors, notified j t
the managers that the time for parley- i
ing was over unless the roads were pre- (
pared to present a modified proposition. <'"'f
you are ready to prepare a modi- ; *
fied proposition," aid Mr. Garretson. j 5
"we are ready to discuss it." I ,
Elisha L.ee. for the railroads, said: "I ! :.in
not going to answer your questions j ?
now, in a definite form. I will take 1 1
t them up with the managers, together j f
with the result of the strike? ballot and \ f
all that appertains to it. Whether we i
have a proposition will develop by our j I
own discussion." j
Mr. Garretson interrupted to say: "I
want you to bear In mind that your i :
committee has not once brought us I
anything resembling a definite proposi- i
tion " ! ?
i (
Sow the Unions Voted. j 1
Kach union head presented his strike ' t
figures in different form. XV. S. Stone s
for the engineers reported 98.17 per ! c
cent in favor of a strike in the southeastern
district, 90.33 per cent in the ; 1
western and 94.61 per cent in the ; ?
eastern. j (
W. S. Carter for the firemen and en- ' j
linemen reported that out of a total of j
70,633 votes cast, including non-union .
en and employes on roads not repre- '
-ented in the conference, 98.04 per cent
ere in favor of a strike. XV. (i. Lee ;

: the western district, 84.?.?8 in the
^ stern and 93.04 In the southern disct,
with 34.S46 votes cast.
!
Objection Is Raised.
The managers objected to the in- j
us ion in the figures of the vote on j
roads not represented in the conference,
f but were informed by the union heads j
' * that the four brotherhoods were tight-:
ir.g for every railroad employe throughout
the country as a matter of principle
They insisted on including these i
figures.
The managers also asked if the vote '
by individual railro.nl would be shown,
but in reply to this the brotherhood
chiefs said that if the roads were will-;
ing to ingke public the r iurn> m the
vote taken, some time .-go by the road
themselves among their employes the
unions would gladly furui.ii their
figures.
Offered to Arbitrate.
In a series of conferences, held earlier
in the ummer. the railroad managers
rejected most of the demands of
th?- brotherhoods and proposed to ar_ j ^
nitrate their differences in accordance! a
with the New lands act. ifi
Since then the officials of the brother- i

BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
CHIC AGO, August 8.?This I
. '
:?nvn is seething with national |
litics this week as well as with
itmosphcric caloric. The national
-ampaign for the western cottn:ry
opens with a rush, and partisan-hope
runs high in each camp.
Fhe national managers for the;
.vest of both parties registered;
.imultaneonsly here. Chairman!
Willcox of the republican nationalj
rommittee and A. A. T. Hert of 1
Kentucky, who is to manage western
headquarters, signing just
tbove Senator Walsh of Montana,
.vho came to take charge of western
headquarters for the dentorrats,
and Senator Salisbury of
Delaware, who with Senator
stone of Missouri and Senator
Walsh will have charge of the
special campaign for election of
Jnited States senators.
Expects Senate Gains.
Senator Salisbury fs not at all dismayed
>y republican preparations for a great
lenatorial drive, and has no thought of
he democrats losing the Senate.
"On the contrary." said Senator Salisbury,
"we will make gains as we have
k?nc in every election since the demorats
took rontrol of the government. I
believe we stand to have sixty democratic
senators in the next Senate."
Senator Walsh immediately went into
'oitferer.ee with Gov. Dunne of this state.
National Committeeman Boeschenstein
tncl Assistant Secretary of Agriculture
I'rooman, the latter to have charge of the
speakers' campaign bureau in the wept?rn
campaign. Gov. Dunne gave Senator
kVnlsh the best comfort he could over the
Uinois situation and?well, let it go at
hat.
National Chairman Willcox was met by
National Committeeman Adams of Iowa,
dert of Kentucky, former Senator
rlemenway of Indiana and Fred Up1am
of Chicago. western treasurer i
>f the national committee. Mr.
rlemenway, while not minimizing
he closeness of the Indiana outlook,
sought to bring a little comfort with the
statement that business men in his state
ire being attracted to the republican nalonal
ticket and that prospects are
lightening regarding the attitude of the
abor vote. Iowa was reported to be good
or a hundred thousand republican pluralty,
and Kentucky was declared to hold
>ut fine prospects for a republican cam>aign.
McCormick Enthusiastic.
Medill McCormick, who is a candiiate
for the republican nomination for
cpres? ntative in Congress at large,!
ame in from a stumping tour of south i
Uinois. He was enthusiastic over the'
epublican outlook in the southern j
ounties, and declared that the com-,
nunitics formerly democratic will go!
epublican this fall and that Illinois
.vi11 roll up a phenomenal republican
duraiity. {<<- said the administration's
dexicari policy is causing the demorat
i disaffection.
The national managers are very
nu' h inter .: ted in a curious situation
n North Dakota. In that state there j
fccently has been perfected an organi- !
sation known as the Non-Partisan ?
-'arrners' Alliance. It is a thoroughly'
mganized movement, having a mem-j
>ershii> of 42."00 voters, a majority of !
.he voter.- <?f the state. It has a treas- I
;ry cash fund of $360,00O with unlim- |
red reserves to draw upon and is in j
ho poliii a! campaign to stick.
The alliance was organized princi- 1
>al'y to secure certain desired state J
. ^lation iri behalf of farmers, and to j
on,; has nominated a non-partisan
rafe ticket which it is generally con-}
<!od will win. They will elect a gov-j
rnor and control the state legislature. ;
t is#admitted by both democrats and!
epublicans. |
Driven to Organization.
The farmers were driven to this by \
.he treatment received at the hands of j
i legislature that repudiated the re- '
ults of a former referendum demand- <
iu: reform in laws regulating the stor
g. and grading of grain. The farmers!
;oit;n-afried that they had been mistreat-'
d by the grain elevator combines, the j
ham ? rs of commerce and state in-j
pv. tors of grain, and that the influence j
>f the elevators and the grain dealers!
si' i the legislature was effective in ;
:ul!ifying th? referendum.
Th< > then proceeded to attempt to J
like o .er the stat" government unto I
h< Ives as thoir only salvation; to i
a legislature and a governor upon
.Ion: they could depend. Money was!
and the work of organization!
. t ! :? 1 a long with perfect system until j
mis stage of the campaign it is con-j
e-i#d that the alliance will control the!
dection.
Will Be Much Courted.
The alliance has not taken a stand on j
national campaign, but it is report-}
d that a majority are friendly to!
Icghes The democrats are making
-cerate attempts to capture the new j
.; arii -.ition. However, the republi-j
are alive to the opportunity and,

prohibition lead- i
ers from all over the United j
States assembled in Indianapolis,
today for a double notification!
meeting. J. Frank Hatily was!
formally notified of his nomination
for President on the prohibition
ticket. Dr. Ira Landrith of
Boston received a similar formal
notification of his nomination for
the vice presidency.
The ceremonies took place at
2 o'clock this afternoon on the
lawn of Mr. Hanlv's home, 2062

H. Patton, state chairman of Illinois,
delivered the address
which notified Mr. Hanlv and
Oliver \Y. Stewart of Indianapolis j
notified Dr. Landrith. Each can-;

Big Rally Tonight.
Tonight a big rally will be held in
the Masonic Temple and will be addressed
by Mr. Hanly and Dr. Landrith.
Ministers and officers of all the young j
people's societies in central Indiana have j
been invited.
The national committee and the cam- j
paign uoiuiniiiee niei uuimg me uaj anu ;
discussed plans for the national campaign ;
to be started immediately. A campaign
manager and sub-committee was to be
chosen before night.
In his address of notification Mr.
Patton took the position that the
liquor traffic is fundamentally wrong.
Complete eradication rather than
treatment to alleviate what he calls
evils of the traffic was advocated.
Mr. Patton said that the liquor traffic
produces evil consequences, and
only evil, and that its legalization for
revenue is wrong is no longer an open
question. No one defends it, and even
the trade itself is crying out for help
to curb its evil tendencies.
Hanly Declares Principles.
Accepting the nomination. Mr. Hanly
said, in part:
"If power is given us we will end
this traffic in alcohol?end it though
it require the exercise of every atom
of power vested in the government or
inherent in the people's legislative
enactments. administrative action,
judicial decision and constitutional
amendment, all shall be used for its
dethronement.
"To the support of this high enterprise
we challenge the intellect, the
heart and the conscience of the nation.
If those who admit the righteousness
of the thing we mean to do. ;
and who desire the consummation of !
the end we seek, will enlist and vote
and stand with us we will elect the
ticket you have named, and before the
end of our first administration render
a service unmatched sir.ee the days of
Abraham Lincoln and the abolition of
human slavery.
Church and State.
"With your declaration 'for the absolute
separation of church and state
with the guarantee of full religious j
and civil liberty* I am in complete ac- j
com. ->?> icusiuun ui gciiii^diiun? I
either the great church of which I am <
a member, or any other?.should exer- i
ci.se domination over the political :
action of individual?? or of groups of !
individuals.
"No disabilities should be imposed j
and no privileges conferred upo i any '
individual on account of his religion, j
The state should not only have toiera- I
tion for every religion, but should pro- i
tect and foster all.
Initiative, Referendum, Recall.
"There is in the platform one plank
which I can neither approve nor ac- i
cept; which I cannot defend in the !
campaign; which, if elected, 1 would
oppose, and which, if brought to me
as a proposed law, 1 would veto. i
refer to the following: 'We favor the j
initiative, referendum and recall.'
"Wherever they have obtained they !
have wrought confusion and harm.
Where the initiative and referendum I
have been applied to the amendment
of constitutions they have made these ]
solemn and organic charters liquid as
water and volatile as oil. They will i
do the same to the federal t'onstitu- ;
tion.
"In my judgment nothing could be |
frought with greater peril to state
and national prohibition of the traffic
in intoxicating liquors than the appli- I
cation of those three principles to the I
state and national governments.
Civil Service.
"There is in your pronouncement in i
regard to the civil service no declara- ?
tion which I do not accept and which '
1 am not prepared to defend. The ex- i
tension of the merit system to cover I
all postmasters, collectors of revenue, |
marshals and other public officials j
whose duties are purely admlnlstra- |
tive would remove many grave and
flagrant abuses from the field of poli- |
tics and insure a higher and more ,
permanent condition of efficiency.
"The whole administrative machinery
of the government should be revised'
by a board of non-partisan experts
to the end that departmental
duplication of work and responsibility
may l>e minimized and an adequate and
efficient system of supervision and accounting
installed. The suggestion in
the platform that the budget system
should be adopted and that the President
should be given power to veto
any item in the appropriation bill meets
with my full approval. There should

Date to Be Set Friday for Trial
on "False Advertising"
Charge.
The date of the trial of Henry;
G. Southwick, secretary and i
treasurer of the Southwick Shop,j
Incorporated, 14th street and <
New York avenue northwest,:
who was arrested yesterday on a
charge of fraudulent advertising,
is to be set Friday. Frank S. j
Smith is the attorney for Mr. j
Southwick. The defendant has |
deposited a bond of $500 for his :
appearance in court.
In the meariMme it is expected that a'
vigorous campaigr. to atop false adver- >
rising in the lustriet of Columbia will;
be pushed by the vigilance advertising '
committee of the Retail Merchants' Association.
which is particularly inter- ;
ested in this, the first case to be'
brought under the law which the association
was instrumental in having!
adopted. No date for a meeting of this
committee has been set as yet, however. ,
Work of obtaining evidence against' i
business houses which are believed to
be violating the lav/ is to be continued, i
If evidr net can be collected which wli 1
justify arrests, warrants will be sworn i
out and the cases taken into court. | i
Individuals Taking- Part.
Cases for prosecution which may he ]
considered within the next few days I i
probably will be handled by individual j
citizens in Washington. To date the
vigiiance advertising committee of the i
Retail Merchants' Association, as a i
committee, has used moral suasion only, 1
and whether this body will wish to go 1
further in the matter will probably be 1
determined when the committee meets
While the chief topic for considera- j
lion at present is the false advertising 1
matter, the fact that the House yester- j I
day passed the "rake auction" bill also j
is creating considerable interest, inas- j
much as certain auctions, considered I
by many to be "fakes," cannot be
brought under the false advertising .
law.
Says Merchants Are Delighted.
"Washington merchants are delighted,
1 am sure, at the action of the House
in passing the fake auction bill," said ,
Secretary Charles J. Columbus of the
Retail Merchants' Association today. .
"We have been carrying forward !
searching investigations in the matter
of fake auctions and will proceed at .
once to lay the results before members j
of the Senate, with a view of securing
quick action. <
"The Retail Merchants' Association has ?
pledged itself to unremitting labors in I
the interest of pure advertising and the 1
elimination of rake auctions. The pas- . <
sage of the false advertising bill was a :
matter of great satisfaction to thea s- I '
so? iation, and I am sure that the mer- j
i. bants and the public generally wilt
realize salutary results from the law. It !
is the result of long and painstaking J
labor on the part of a committee of the
association. In the final conferences
with Representative Johnson Assistant '
Corporation Counsel' Roger J. Whiteford
aided the officers of the Retail Merchants'
Association substantially, as did
also Corporation Counsel Syme.
Advertising Clubs to Aid.
"We have received assurances from the
Associated Advertising Clubs of the
World, through Chairman Sidener an 1
Secretary Kenner of the national vigilance
committee, that the Retail Merchants'
Association would have the unqualified
support of that organization In
the prosecution of cases before our
vigilance committee and under the law/'

LONDON, August 8. 12:45 p.m.? J1.
British troops, pursuing the Turkish
force defeated last week at Romani,
have caught up with the Turkish rear
guard six miles east of Katia, about
thirty miles east of the Suez canal,
<:i vs an official statement rAfrnrrtinc *1
the campaign in Egypt, issued today.
The statement follows:
"The commander-in-chief in Egypt
reports at 10:50 p.m. that his mounted
troops are in contact with the Turkisn
rear guard in a position six miles east tf
-jf Katia. which he intrenched some ^
lavs ago at the beginning of his ad- cc
irance. tc
"The work of clearing the battle- |
Held is proceeding, a nd a quantity of | cj.
rifles and. other war material has been ! w
t>rouaht in. Up to the time of this I B
report 2C0 of the enemy's dead have j rtieen
buried in the area over which ^
the counter attack passed on August 4.
"A bomb attack by aeroplanes over
Port Said and Suez inflicted little ma- rn
terial damage and caused slight casu- Si
llties." t0
Ends Fear of Invasion. u
The British representative with the ur
irmy at Romain sends the following, un- ^
ier date cf August 5: TJ
"At sunset yesterday Turkish preensions
for the conquest of Egypt were j ki
rretrievably smashed. While a cres-jth
:ent moon faintly lighted the desert, j ^
ve pursued the defeated Turkish troops j si:
rigorously. j te
"The brunt of the fight was borne by i
he Anzac mounted troops, who ac- !
luitted themselves magnificently. For Q
nore than a week they had little rest, |
:ecping in touch with the enemy, push- |
ng back patrols and reconnoitering.
[*helr final attacks yesterday were iresistible.
"Whether the Turks will try to hold g(
he trenches dug by them remains to
>e seen, but whatever happens, Egypt
s safer from invasion than at any time
luring the war. No finer vindication
>f Gen. Murray's policy of making the
rurks fight far from the canal could
>e given than that traffic on the waterway
has not stopped for a single
ninute. Pi
"The Turks fought hard, but the cr
irlsoners were delighted to be in Britsh
hands, receiving good food and e
bundant water. At the present writ- to
ng the enemy is scattered far and wide w!
n the desert, not in orderly column, but I th
n small parties, and many of these ..
oubtless will be taken prisoner. The
