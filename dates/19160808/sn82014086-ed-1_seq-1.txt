capture of two trenches from the Rus
sians. Constantinople reports a se
ries of gains for the Turks fighting
against the Russians, and Petrograd
admits at least one of the claims
that the Russians have been forced
to retire under pressure to the region
east of Kermansha, Persia. An attack
by the Russians north of Bukan on
the Persian front, was put down with
heavy losses to the Russians, accord
ing to Constantinople and in Turkish
Armenia, and it is said the Russians
have been put to flight and positions
retaken which the Russians had pre
viously captured. The latest reports
concerning the attack of the Turks
against the British forces with the
Suez canal their objective indicates
that the Ottoman forces met with a
serious offensive.
They have now been cleared from
the Kaki-Umishi basin. Violent fight
ing is in progress between the Aus
trians and Italians on various sectors
especially around the Goriza bridge
head, on the Iioberbo plateau and on
the lower Isono river. Near Mont Sa
Ijino and Monte San Mioheie tho Ital

portion of these were later re-ta'icn
by the Austrians. On the lower Isono

violent counter attacks.

STREET CAR STRIKE IN
NEW YORK IS ENDED
Directors and Employes Accept Plan
Proposed by Mayor Mitchel.
New York, August 7. The strike
on the surface railway lines here,
which threatened to extend to the
subway and elevated systems and
thus completely tie up transportation
facilities in greater New York, virtual
ly came to an end tonight. Direct
ors of the New York Railways Com
pany and Third Avenue Railway Com
pany, the two principal lines affected,
voted to accept a plan of settlement
proposed by Mayor Mitchel and Oscar
S. Straus, chairman of tho public ser
vice commission, after representatives
of the strikers had agreed to it.
Soon afterwards it was announced
that normal service would be resumed
tomorrow morning on the lines which
ratified the agreement.
One of the chief concessions in the
settlement gives the employes the
right to organize, which was the issue
the strike leaders said they were de
termined should be fought to the cod.
The companies agree to treat with the
grievance committees of their em-
p!oyes irrespective of the fact that
they may belong to a union. Wage de
mands will be arbitrated, the provision
being made that negotiations must be
gin not later than August 20.
"The settlement between the em
ployes and the New York Railways
company and Third Avenue railway
company makes it inevitable that the
other h'nes must settle their differene
f s." declared Mpyor Mitchell. The di
rectors of the New York Railways com
pany were deadlocks!' for twelve
.wins before they covin agree on trie
terms of the settlement.
Although the agreement concedes the
light of the employes to organize, the
union is not recognized by the com
pany. Mr. Shonts in a statement
calling on the strikers to let "by-gones
be by-gones and gf L to work giving
New York the best street railway
service in the world."
MANUFACTURE OF PAPER
FROM COTTON STALKS
Discovery Has Been Made in a Sub
urb of Berlin.
Berlin. July 3o (Correspondence cf
the Associated Press) The roval ma
terial testing oflice at Gross-Lieher-
felde. a suburb of Berlin, announces
the interesting discovery that paper
can be manufacturer from cotton
stalks.
The discovery is not considered of
much importance for Germany, which
produces no cotton, but will be a
God -send to the United States. the
greatest producer of cotton in the
world, because of the shortage of
paper reported in that country.
The discovery was made, it is stated
by a German insiiUmon while carry
ing out a commission from an Egyp
tian firm, given before the war. A
shipment of stalks, w-lch had arrived
from Egypt before the opening of the j
war was used for the experiment. The
stalks were cut and ground, boiled
and bleached and the paper makin;
then proceeded after the usual meth
ods.
UNABLE TO FIND A
SUBSTITUTE FOR WOOD PULP
Private and Government Laboratories
Have Sought One in Vain.
New York, Aug. 7. Lincoln B. Pal
mer, manager of the American News
paper Publishers' Association said to
day that although private and prov
ernmental laboratories had been seek
ing1 for years to find a suitable substi
tute for wood pulp in the manufacture
cf paper, nothing had as yet been
produced that would stand the test.
"If the Germans have solved the
problem.'' lie said, "they will have
rendered the Tnited States a. valuable
service, and it ought to brin? millions
to the inventor of the process. The
discovery, if true, should prove a boon
to the paper making industry in this
country."

iN HIS FIRST SPEECH Orr TRANS
CONTINENTAL TRIP
DETROIT LAST NIG HT
Denounces Violations of Civil Service
by Appointing Inexperienced Men to
Diplomatic Posts Asks "What is
the President's Mexican Poilcy?"
Detroit, Mich., Aug. 7. Charles K.
Hughes in the first set speech of his
trans-continental trip .tonight assail
ed the administration vigorously for
its foreign policy, its JJexican policy,
for appointing- men whom he termed
inexperienced to diplomatic posts and
for what he characterized as "ra-ii up
on ths civil service of the i.niitu
States."
"lie kept us out of war,-' Air. JTiighes
said, "referring to the president ard
that democratic slogan. Yet ive seis
ed Vera Cruz. That was var very
ignoble war. And it was c-iled wai
over the bodies of those dead soldiers;
it was called a war of service.
What is Wilson's Policy
"Talk about what is your policy?
What is the presi jeot'.i policy dous
any one know? Has the executive
ever iiad a policy for more than six
months on the ilsxici'i question ? 1
repeat: Who knows what the poiiov
of the administration wiil be three
months hence'.' .Viy friends, tlie
trouble is that this administration has
written buch a record that no matter
what it says, you do not know
.u .vhv'- it wni suck to it. We have
,:u ;'.vln!iiiioii during the past
three months which, I confess tills mo
. u v.v.-c p Si.-i.ae of shame. 1 have
noi a panicle of militaristic spirit in
iny system, but if 1 am elected presi
dent 1 will see to it that American
rights in Mexico are respected."
-Ir. Hughes assailed the adminis
tration's course toward upholding
American rights abroad during the
l-uropean war.
American Rights
"When I say that I am an American
citizen," the nominee said, "1 ought
to say the proudest thing that a man
can say in this world. Hut you can't
have that pride if American citizenry
is a cheap thing, if it is not worthy of
protection this wide world over. Theie
is no man who could successfully pre
sent to t.n American community the
p:i; li. rin ihat an American's citizen's
rii.;hts stop at the coast line and' that
U-yimil tl:.:t .-'.nieuier.n life is to be the
prey of s.ny marauder that chooses to
take ic."
Civil Service Operations.
The nominee cited the republican
pinuorm's declaration that 30,'JOO gov
ernment positions had been taken liom
the operation of th- civil service law
curiny the present administration and
declared that "the sort of thing has got
to stop." He told of an instance,
where, lie said "an eminent scientist"
in the coast and geodetic survey, 'a
mi'.n of very prominent rank" had been
displaced to make room for an ex
cellent stock breeder and veterinary
si-i-geon." The federal trade commis
sion Mr. Huj-'hes (.-barged, "was i airly
en,:i: culal i'd with the law by th i men.
for tin most part, who were appo'.mea
to places upon it."
l.-iexcusable Change of Diplonvits
"It wi-s mexcuiabie," Mr. Hughes
asseited, for the administration to
take out in country at'ler coue'ry in
Latin America, v. uc-'-e we have fie
qtieiilly said we desired to cultivate
the diplornaiic service, who, had the
tne must fi-ionaly relations," "men in
co-miry oversowing with credit and
important experience" and put in men
utterly inexperienced. 1'ast adminis
trations the nominee said, "had thin
ned in that particular, but standards
were being made and there were men
in our service of long eperience, tine
training." Other appoinments by the
president were assailed.
"If we are to have a secretary of
state," Mr. Hughes declared, "we want
a man who will stand before the world
as a man of learning, of skill, of ex
perience, of power."
Need for Industrial Brotherhood.
Mr. Hughes also laid stress on what
he termed the need for industrial
brothrhood and closer co-operation
between employers and employes. There
was no capitalistic class, no labor
ing class in prosperity, he said, but the
prosperity of the country or its lack
affected all citizens. It behooved
the men responsible for th policies of
the country, he said, to look forward to
the day wiie nBurope ,at peace, would
wase tierce commercia 1 compe
tition with America and to guard
American workingmen against that
time.
Made Six Speeches.
After his ma'in address at Arcadia
hall, Mr. Hughes delivered a second
address at the Light Guard armory in
which he reiterated many of the state
ments made in the first address. Mr.
Hughes spent a strenuous day in the
terrible heat of Detroit. He made six
speeches between noon and ten o'clock
tonight. The first talk of the day was
delivered in a little room of the hotel
where he made his headquarters and
was addressed to about forty manu-
j faettirers, interested In the social wel-
i
on suffrage. One hundred women
heard him repeat his declaration in
New York that he wanted the question
speedily settled be granting women the
vote thrnrifi-h amendment to the fed
ral constitution.
Went to Ball Game.
After luncheon the nominee went to
"" bnl' s-ame. He hook hands with
tfte members of the Detroit and Fhila
.... .. 4.H. on ia league teams and
: inning- of tho game. Then
ho motored away to two automobile
i.ici.)rio ttnd addressed crowds at each
