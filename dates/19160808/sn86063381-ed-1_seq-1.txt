AMENDMENT NO. 1

F. W. Murphy, President of All-Min
nesota Development Association,
Visits in Bemidji.
IS MUCH IMPRESSED
WITH CITY OF BEMIDJI
Praises Work of the Northern Min
nesota Editorial Association in
This Section.
P. W. Murphy of Wheaton, presi
dent of the All-Minnesota Develop
ment association, -who was a visitor
in Bemidji Monday enroute from Cass
Lake where he attended the editorial
outing, is a strong/supporter of
Amendment No. 1 providing for a re
volving fund for the reclamation of
state lands. In a statement to a rep
resentative of the Pioneer he empha
sized the importance of the amend
ment.
Visit a Revelation.
"My visit to Cass Lake and Be
midji. has been a revelation to me,"
said Mr. Murphy. "I am profoundly
impressed with the marked advance
that has been made, along agricul
tural lines. Fine farms are upon
every hand and both in town and
country are evidences of general
prosperity.
"A visit to this portion of Minne
sota emphasizes the necessity for the
adoption of Amendment No. 1. The
state lands should be settled by home
builders and it seems wise indeed for
the state to 'fit small tracts for the
man of limited means upon which he
may produce the necessities of life
while clearing other lands. This will
mean more settlers, more land on the
tax* lists, increased production, bet
ter support for the towns and cities
and a general growth along all
lines."
Praiser Bemidji.
Mr. MuTpfey^n^ras'Tntrch^-rnrpressied-
in regards to Bemidji.
."JVh^st a. delight!ul surprise awaits,
a visitor in Bemidji," he said. "its
splendid buildings, paved streets,
well appointed hotel, its lakeall
combine to make a city in which its
citizens may well take a dignified
pride.
"Then that beautiful resort,
'Birchmont Beach,' nestling among
the birches at the north end of Lake
Bemidji, at once pleases the eye, in
vites you to tarry, supplies your every
want and bid and be at peace with
yourself and the world. Here is a
real summer resort."
Editors Aid Growth.
Mr. Murphy praised the Northern
Minnesota Editorial association for
its work in this district. He said,
"Great credit is due to the Northern
Minnesota Editorial association and
ts members for their unselfish ef
forts in behalf of this portion of the
state. The editors have not only per
sistently called attention to the needs
of Northern Minnesota, but have la
bored for the carrying out of the
many projects that have resulted in
the growth of this section."
