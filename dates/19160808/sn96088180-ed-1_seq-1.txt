Berne, Aug. 8. The Berlin Tag-

submarine Bremen, which was to
have arrived at an American port,
baa been sunk through an accident
to her machinery, according to a des
patch received here this afternoon.
Baltimore, Aug. 8. When shown
the despatch today, stating; the sub
marine freighter Bremen, sister ship
of the Deutschland, bad been sunk,
Henry M. Hilken, head of the East
ern Forwarding (company, local
agenta of the sub-sea line here, said
the report is "possibly true." Hlllken
said local egenta of the undersea line
had no knowledge when the Bremen
bad left for America, nor had they
any word from her since sailing.
Boston. Aug. 8. After an all-
night vigil by watchers along the
coast ' from Eastport to Boston, the
anticipated arrival "of another Ger
man merchant aubmarine failed to
materialise early today. Following
the report of Lowell W. Dunn, look
out at Cross Island, that he had
observed two submarines rise to the
surface and then submerge, the en
tire coast or New England was
stirred to watchfulness.
It was expected that If -Dunn's re
port was true, the mysterious craft
would .have been seen again or turn
ed Into a port along the main coast.
Both Portsmouth and Charlestown
navy yards were insistent that no
United States submarines were In
Maine waters and a high official of
the Fore River shipyards declared
that there were no British submar-
Ines In Canadian waters that might
stray down the Maine coast.
