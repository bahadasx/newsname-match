cago, It was announced last night by

"Mr. Hert will have associated with
him at headquarters other members
of the committee.
"Mr. Frank H. Hitchcock has been
prominently named In connection
with this work, but some days ago he
Informed me that he was only not a

AVIATORS OE
ENGLAND DO
GREAT WORK
Feats Surpass the Wildest
Flights of Imagination—
Bomb Many Places.
With the British Armies in France,
Aug 8, via London.—The aviators felt
the concussion 9,000 feet in the air
when a British brigade of aeroplanes
bombarded Henin Lietard (northeast
of Arras) with a shower of 112
pound bombs-
When the German sheds and store
houses at Martinpuich were fired by
Incendiary bombs a vast pillar of
smoke from the conflagration rose to a
height of 8,000 feet.
The work of the British aviators
recently has surpassed the wildest
flights of imagination. Aerial fights
which attract sensational attention are
only an incident of the offensive cam
paign. Overwhelming numbers of
-planes exe concentrated on the nar
row front of the Somme battle in co
ordination -with a superior, unceasing
volume gun fine. The planes move
tn larger and larger flotillas and there
have been cases with a doeen en
gaged in battle on either side.
The German first line and second
line trenches, headquarters, billets and
supply depots of all kinds have been
bombed, the aerial offensive being
limited only by the number of planes
and the supply of bombs.
Not a village occupied by the Ger
mans In the neighborhood of the front
that has not had its aerial bombard
ment, according to accounts. Barges
and motor trucks have been set on
fire one moving train was blown up.
The dry official accounts of the
aviation corps and their aviators' Jar
gon reveal a number of amazing feats
every day. A pilot describes an aver
age experience thus: "I first attacked
a Roland, but finding a Fokker be
hind, turned and maneuvered under
his tall. He fired one drum at very
close range, and the Fokker nose
dived and went down with a spin."
IT It had gone direct. It would have
been a "crasher."
FAMOUS JAPANESE
ADMIRAL IS DEAD
Tokio, Aug. 8.—Vice Admiral Hik
onojo Kamimura, of the Japanese
navy is dead.
Vloe Admiral Kamimura who was
years old, was one of ths most
prominent officers In the Japanese
navy. As commander Jn chief of the
Seoond squadron, he played an Im
portant part tn the Russo-Japanese
war, and is believed to have led In
the naval assault with .the British
equadron against the German base at
IMng-Tao. China, 1S14.
Tn August, 1901, the squadron of
Admiral Kamimura defeated the Rus
sian warships, Rurlk, Gromobol and
Rossi a. off the east ooaet of
sinking the Rwlk and capturing the
other two, badly daznaged.
Prior to this Kamimura had been
unpopular because the Rurlk with
which the Gromobol and Roesla com
posed the Vladivostok squadron, had
destroyed two transports loaded with
Japanese troop*. His victory re-,
deemed his reputation with the mass
es In Japan, and his reputation was
further enhanced later when Ms
aquadron took a leading part in the
battle or the Sea of Japan, -when
Russia's naval power was destroyed
After this battle, he was awarded the
title of Baron and invested with the
Grand Cordon ,of the Rising Sun and
the first class order of the Golden
Kite.

NEW PAPER-MAKING
METHOD DISCOVERED
Berlin, July 80. (Correspondence of
The Associated Press.)—The royal
material testing, office at Gross-Llch
terfelde, a suburb of Berlin, announc
es the interesting discovery that pa
per can be manufactured from cot
ton stalks.
The discovery la not considered of
much importance for Germany, which
produces no cotton, but it Is pointed
to as of vast Importance to the Unit
ed States, the greatest producer of
cotton in the world, because of the
shortage of paper reported In that
country.
The stalks are cut and ground,
boiled and bleached, and the paper
making then proceeds after the usual
methods.
Nothing Produced.
New Yoric, Aug. 8.—Lincoln B.
Palmer, manager of the American
Newspaper Publishers' association,
said yesterday that a'though private
and governmental lejpr&toriee had
been seeking for years* find a suit
able substitute for wood pulp In the
manufacture of paper, nothing as yet
has been produced that would stand
the test.
"If the Germans have solved the
problem," he said,, "they will have
rendered the United States a valuable
service, and it ought to bring millions
to the inventorj of the process. The
discovery, if true, should prove a
boon to the paper-making Industry In
this country."

IAKESHIPPING
I. W. W. Secretary Trying
to Get Duluth Dockmen
to Strike.
Duluth, Minn., Aug. 8.—"Our aim
now is to paralyze the shipping indus
try at Duluth and Superior, to tie up
all lake traffic, to keep boats idle and
the dockmen on strike so as to help
the miners on the Mesaba range,"
stated Louis Malis, local I. W- W.
secretary at the organization head
quarters today.
Jubilant over having 300 dock
laborers strike in Superior and be
come affiliated with the I. W. W.,
Malis said branch officials now will
attempt to spread the strike to Du

luth were granted a wage increase,
Malis said, the I. W. W. cannot in

contract.
CELEBRATE NATAL
DAY ON VESSEL
Stockholm, Sweden, July 31.—(Cor
respondence of the Associated Press).
—Americans who arrived in Scan
dinavia recently on the steamer Ber
gensfjord told of a decidedly unique
celebration of the Fourth of July on
board that vessel. On the third of
July, the Bergensfjord, a Norwegian
ship, was "captured" by a British
cruiser and escorted into Kirkwall for
the customary examination of cargo
and passsngers. Despite the fact that
they were to be "captives" over the
Fourth in a British harbor the pas
sengers decided to hold a fitting cele
bration and to read anew the Declar
ation of Independence. All the neu
trals on board decided to join the
Americans and Captain Irgens of the
Bergensfjord appointed a committee
to arrange everything.
The hour set for the ceremonies was
11 o'clock the morning of the Fourth.
It was found at that timtf, however,
that the British authorities required
the presence of all first class passen
gers and the reading of the Declara
tion was postponed until 2 o'clock. At
this hour the oeremonies were begun
anew. "America" was sung, a short
prayer was offered and then Captain
Irgens arose.
'1 regret it very much." he an
nounced, "but the Declaration of In
dependence must again be postponed
as the Britleh authorities require the
presenoe of the second class passen
gers in their dining room."
At 8 o'clock the ship's company as
sembled again to hear proclaimed the
principles of a free and independent
people. But again Captain Irgens
arose.
"I regret again to have to announce
a further postponement of the Declar
ation of Independence, but the Brit
ish authorities, who do not recognise
the Fourth of July as a holiday, say
they n\ust have the third class pas
sengers in their dining saloon at
once."
Forty-five minutes later the British
authorities had concluded their ex
amination of the neutrals and this
time the Declaration was read amid
great enthusiasm!
The'Bergensfjord, however, and
the Americans aboard her, remained
In "captivity" until the afternoon of
th* fifth.

CUBAN CONGRESS
DOES VERY LITTLE
Havana, Cuba, Aug. 1-—(Corre
spondence of the Associated Press).—
The Cuban congress, which has prac
tically ended its active sessions, has
achieved hardly any serious legisla
tion. There have been many weeks
when a quorum was not present, and
the few sessions recently held have
been devoted to such bills as seemed
likely to be vetoed by the president.
One such was to compel the presi
dent to divest himself of his func
tions of office sixty-five days before
election, which the president vetoed,
and another was to provide for the
payment of claims of soldiers and civ
ilians in connection with the revolu
tion of 1895, which the president has
Indicated his intention to veto In case
it passes the senate.
It appears probable that congress,
while not transacting any business,
will remain theoretically in session
until after the elections in November.
The reason is that the members hold,
by a curious interpretation of the
constitution, that their congressional
Immunity from arrest extends to all
civil and criminal offenses so long as
the body remains in session.
Reperesentatlves of British oil in
terests in Mexico are here for the pur
pose, it is said, of influencing the
passage of legislation for the admis
sion of petroleum into Cuba free of
duty. As congress 1b -unlikely to
transact any business until the elec
tion Is over it Is improbable that there
will be any discussion of the proposi
tion until the next session.
FOULPLAYTS
THE BRIEF
Jamestown Officials Think
Jack Dick Was Victim
of I. W. W.'s.
(Herald Special Service.)
Jamestown, N. D.t Aug. 8.—Foul
play is suspected in the mysterious
disappearance of Jack Dick, former
carpenter on the Northern Pacific new
station here. Railroad officials and
police are inclined to believe he was
a victim of I. W- W.'s.
Dick left Jamestown about three
weeks ago for Oberon to take em
ployment. Becoming ill, he procured
a doctor's order to see a physician at
Carrington. After leaving for that
point he has not been seen since.
Dick never asked for his time at
headquarters. This leads officials and
officers to the foul play theory.
NEW ARMOURPLANT

plant.
That statement was made by C. W.
Gordon on his return yesterday from
Chicago, where he conferred with of
ficials of the company. The original
plans, Mr. Gordon said, were deemed
Inadequate by company officials and
would be enlarged upon.
Whether the added plans will neces
sitate the acquisition of more land is
not known.
Spend at least $3,000,000.
"I conferred with officials of the
Armour company while I was in Chi
cago Saturday," said Mr. Gordon.
"About all there is to say is that
they have decided to expend at least
$3,000,000 in building the South St
Paul plant."
Begin Cast of September.
Work on the project. Mr. Gordon
has been assured, will begin the last
of September or the first of October.
Mr. Gordon has beer in the east

tion of the time in Cnnnectcut.

No Action Till Other
Agencies Fail.
New York, Aug. 8.—Four hundred

four brotherhoods, placed before the
managers of the railroads the question
as to whether the roads are willing
to grant the demands for an eight
hour day and a time and half pay tot
over-time, or submit to a strike.
The result of the strike vote taken
by the employes during the past
month was presented to the national
conference of committee of managers
and showed an overwhelming major
ity in favor of authorizing their chiefs
to call a strike.
The managers made no definite an
swer, and they renewed their de
mands. It was agreed to adjourn until
tomorrow morning to give the man
agers time for further discussion.
Managers objected to the inclusion
in the figures of the vote of roads not
represented In the conference, but
were informed by union heads that
the four brotherhoods are fighting for
every railroad employe throughout
the country as a matter of principle.
They Insisted on Including the figures.
The managers also asked If the
vote by individual roads would be
shown, buH. in reply the brotherhoods
said that if the roads were willing to
make public the returns of the vote
taken some time ago, by the roads
themselves among the employes, the
unions would gladly furnish the fig
ures.
