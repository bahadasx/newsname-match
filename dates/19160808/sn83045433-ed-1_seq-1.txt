GERMANS HURLED
BACK BY BRITISH 9
FRENCH ADVANCE
Teutons Repulsed While At
tempting Five Counter-At
tacks in Pozieres Sector.
(By the international News Service.)
London. Aug. 7.-Five determined coun
ter-attacks by the Germans were beaten
back by the British in the Posieres sec
tor today, while on both the Somme and
Meuse the French continued to make
gains.
An entire line of German defenses on
a half-mile front from the wood north
of Hem to the Somme was captured in a
spectacular assault by Gen. Foch's
troops.
On the Verdun front Gen. Nivelle threw
his forces forward in new attacks, in
which a further gain was registered
south of the Thiaumont work. and more
fortified houses in Fleury were taken.
The Germans for more than eighteen
hours have been striving desperately to
develop a counter-offensive against the
British, but all their attempts have met
with failure. Preceding the five furious
attacks today. numerous attempts were
made last night to penetrate the British
trenches east of Pozieres. Gen. Haig
tonight reports that the English troops
hold all the ground gained in yesterday's
attacks.
On the Verdun front during the night
the Germans also determinedly launched
attack after attack, only to be repulsed
by the French barrier and machine-gun
fire. Both at Thiaumont and in the
Vaux-Chapitre woods the German in
fantry was sent forward after strong
artillery preparation, only to be driven
back without having gained a foot of
ground.
During the day the French and British
captured a number of German prisoners
and took fifteen machine guns.

Von Hoetzend cf's forces against the
Italians on Monte Sabolizo and Monte
San Michel. positions lost in the initial
orslaughts of Cardona's men a few days
ago were reconquered. and 1,22 prison
ers remained in Austrian hands, among
them thirty-two officers.
A violent battle is still in progress on
the slopes of the two mountains.
The Austrian success, while unexpected
in view of the fact that they have been
hard pressed for weeks on the whole
front, was more than offset by an Ital
ian victory.
The Rome war office announced tonight
that rearly the whole of Hill No. &), in
the Monfalcone sector, was captured and
held against all counter-attacks, the Aus
trians taking in yesterday's fighting 3,60
prisoners, including 100 officers.
Three guns and "dozens of machine
guns" also were taken by the victors.
Several lines of Austrian entrenchments
were captured in fierce hand-to-hand
fighting on Hills 5 and 1-1.
The Italians continued throughout the
last tweenty-four hours their vigorous
bombardments of Goritz. and attacks
were launched on the whole front be
tween the Goritz Bridgehead and the
Dobeerdo Plateau, while the big guns of
both sides are thundering without pause
along the entire sector from the Tolmino
Bridgehead to the sea.

a sudden, vigorous thrust eastwards fror

Indications that the situation was tak

statements from Petrograd, Berlin and
Vienna remove the last doubts.
The race Is in full swing. It is mark
ed by bitter battles before Kovel, ir
the northeastern and southeastern cor

foothills on the Pruth. Both sides made
headway toward their main objective
during the past twenty-four hours, the
Itussians toward Kovel and Lemberg, the
Teutons in their counter offensive in the
Carpathians.

8-HOUR DAY

Trainmen Today Will Demand
Better Working Conditions.
Alternative Is Strike.

New Yoik. Aug. 7. Armed with a
practically unanimous vote from 400.
000 railway trainmen, heads of the
four railway employes brotherhoods
will meet the railroad managers to
morrow to demand again the eight
hour day.
The alternative the "big four" will
lay on the table will be a nation
wide strike, tying up every freight
and passenger train in the United
States.
The counting of the st rike vote was
completed late today at the Broadway
Central Hotel, and although no an
nouncement was made, it is known
the members of the four great broth
erhoods voted almost unanimously to
strike if the eight-hour day is not
granted. The exact vote will be re
vealed to the railway representatives.
Union officials today refused to be
quoted on possible action other than
to say they cannot now back down if
they wish.
"With the tremendous vote behind
us we can only stand for the shorter
hours, pay for overtime, and better
conditions we have demanded." said
one leader.
No indication of the course to be
followed by the railroads could be ob
tained. Their representatives were in

GOTHAM CAR
STRIKE ENDS
New York Railways Company
Capitulates, Employes
Winning Demands.
(By the International News Service.)
New York. Aug. 7.-The street rail
roads strike came to an end tonight. The
New York Railways Company capitulat
ed. The result is an overwhelming vic
tory for the men.
The company did not agree to recog
nize the union. But they conceded the
"legal and moral" right of the men to
organize. And while they did not de
clare their recognition of the union, they
stipulated that they "will receive and
treat with a committee of the employes
upon any and all questions." The com
pany agrees, morover. to Interfere in no
way with the selection of any committee
to represent the employes.
The terms of agreement will. it is de
clared unreservedly, be accepted by the
Second Avenue (the Blue Line) and the
Queens and Staten Island lines. This
acceptance will likely come to pass to
morrow.
The Third Avenue Railroad Company
agreed late tonight to ratify the same
terms of agreement. There remains now
nothing but to watch for a similar out
break in the ranks of the Brooklyn
Rapid ,Transit Company empoles. It is
believed that the men across the bridge
will seek the same victory an their
Manhattan brethren have gained.
The terms of settlement are embodied
in the letter of Theodore P. Shonts to
Mayor Mitchel. The letter was written
Sunday. It was virtually a rehearsal of
the -demands of the men as set forth by
the union.
The terms were promptly accepted by
Messrs. Mahon. Fitzgerald. Frayne and
Fridiger, representing the men.
