New York, Aug. 8. The intense

is opportune (whatever that is) to see
him. You hang around the office' till I

ston owned the Maxwell and Bailey
was taking him home in his new car.
Dr. Livingston is very proud of his
new car and feels that he has in the

greatest returns on his investment.
ANCIENTS DID GOOD WORK

; Present Day.
Montezuma's well, a natural lake fed
by artesian flow at Camp Verde, Ariz.,
which . has been offered for sale
to the federal i- government, is one
of the geological features of that
neighborhood. Surrounded, as it is,
by high natural walls, it seems from
a distance to be a small mountain.
The outside of these walls was pierced
in a prehistoric age by cliff dwellers.
The well , is a great spring and has
been used for irrigation purposes for
many years. Its depth has never been
absolutely ascertained, but is known
to be in excess of 500 feet. The wa
ter is highly charged with lime, and
moss removed from the inside walls
and exposed to the air soon petrifies,
the fibers being clearly discernible in
the composition." That the "well" ."sup
plied the original, and now unknown,
inhabitants of the valley with water
for their Celds and gardens is estab
lished by the tracing of a system of
irrigation "ditchers,. ihicli, according to
geologists, must have been construct

The water they curried deposited lime
along the entire system, and the forma

places, measure more than three feet
thick. The builders performed an en

WOMAN MAKES LOJfG
DRIVE IN MAXWELL
Tours from Texas to Detroit, Making
Great Economy Record Children
Learn Geography First Hand
Mrs. Dick O'Bannon, of Sherman,
Texas, motored into Detroit last week
in her pet automobile, "Bill."
"Bill" is a Maxwell touring car with
a fine appetite for the open road, but
a very moderate thirst.
"He is . strictly temperance," said
"Mrs. O'Bannon. "I kept close track
on his gasoline consumption and it
averaged 24 miles to the gallon on the
long trip from Dallas to Detroit."
Residents of her home town are all
wrought up over Mrs. O 'Bannon's
long. tour. She says the folks are bet
ting against her making a finished job
of it. The men folks are particularly
skeptical, merely because she set out!
to show this tour could be made with-'
out a man along. -
Besides Mrs. O'Bannon, there is her
neighborr-Mrs. R. E. Minshew, 'and
her three children, Allan, aged 13;
Frank, nine; and Mary Grace, four.
Then there is a lot of baggage, oed
ding, cooking utensils, etc., for the
O'Bannon party is doing a lot of
camping out along the trail. Alto
gether, the Maxwell is loaded down
with 1,000 pounds avoirdupois.
Since he hit the trail at Dalla3,
"Bill" has passed through Texas, Ok
lahoma, Kansas, Missouri,- Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. .", Before
he takes his precious party back
home, he's going back to Ohio, thence
to New- York and, finally, he will take
in Washington, D. C, because the
children want to see where the presi
dent of the United States .lives.
It's all a matter of geography. Mrs.
O'Bannon says her children have
learned more, about their country this
summer than they could have absorb
ed in five years at school. '
"The old-fashioned way of learning
geography was through books,", she
says. "But there's no use doing that
when we have Maxwells. Bill takes
us wherever we want to go. We've
had no trouble. We've taken some
rough roads, but 'Bill thrives on
punishment. I've driven a car less
than a year, so I'm still an amateur.
I dont know any tricks about saving
gasoline. But I have kept close re
cord and we've averaged 24 miles to
the gallon all the way through."
Besides touring through the coun
try, the party has -taken in most of
the alrge cities along the way. Mrs.
O'Bannon, in spite of limited exper
ience at-the wheel, had no trouble
negotiating the congested streets of
Chicago and Detroit.

You need not worry if you have two

KIIOTI PHESEIITS
OCHATS
To the Democrats of Florida:
Friday, August 4, aji article ap
peared in the Florida Metropolis, pur
porting to emanate from Catts' advis
ers, from which I quote the third and
sixth paragraphs, as follows:
CATTS HAS TURNED INQUISITOR
"Each county official in Florida, and
each nominee to county office will be
asked the direct question whether or
not he is supporting Catts. Unequivo
cal replies are expected, and, as a
matter of fact, will be more or less de
manded, as the 'machine figures it is
in position to force the opponents of
Mr. Catts from the cover of equivocal
answers to such questions. ;
"The newly-formed, or new-born
effort is to be an aggressive one, tak
ing the off ensive in i the political situ
ation and is designed to .force well-
covered and subtle opposition ; from
county officials and officials-elect and
their individual f ollowings out into
the light, where the 42-centimeter
campaign guns can be trained into
range arid where the mortars or or
ganized influence can get into action.
WHAT IS HIS MOTIVE? .
What do these utterances mean?
Are the democrats through their ex
ecutive committees, to have no voice
in the selection of appointees,? Will
Mr. Catts, if elected governor, trump
up charges against all judges who
may render decisions against him in
this contest, and against all sheriffs
and other officers who may perform
acts not of his liking, remove them
from office and appoint his own
choice? ' ; :;'";r' "
Again, have you investigated what
manner of politics this man professed
in the state from which he came, or
what manner of man he was there?
WHAT HAS CATTS DONE FOR !
FLORIDA
Has he worked for Florida and help
ed to bear her burden, or done any-;
thing to entitle him to be the .chief j
magistrate of this state?
All of these I submit are serious j
questions which all true and loyal;
democrats of this state should stop j
and consider. ,
IS RUNNING AS AN INDEPEND
ENT
Mr. Catts has already started on
his campaign as an independent. By
not awaiting the result of the pending
proceedings to secure an accurate and
correct count 'in "Hamilton, Duval,
Putnam, St. Lucie, Nassau, Orange
and other counties, he has practically
admitted that a correct count of the
first and second choice votes will show
that I was in fact the real nominee of
the party in the late primary elec
tion. For my part, I am perfectly
willing for him to run as an independ
ent, for, judging from his public ut
terances on the stump and in .the
press, he is not now a democrat and
never has been.
CATTS CRY OF "WOLF!
His hue and cry from one" end of
the state to the other is "Fraud!
fraud! wolf! wolf!" What is wrong
with the gains which have been shown
I made in Leon, in Hamilton, in Du
val, in Clay, in Putnam, in Orange
and in Suwanee counties?
KNOTT ONLY WANTS AN ACCUR
ATE COUNT
Those who saw the recounting done
in .Putnam county say : "The recount
in Putnam county was made so openly
and so fairly showing that all tjiat
Mr. Knott and his friends wish is an
accurate count of the vote as actually
cast in the June primary that the
most rampant of the Catts radicals
have failed to find the slightest
grounds upon which to base a cry of
trying to steal votes, etc"
Besides, did you read the letter of
Mr. Blackwell of Live" Oak, and the
affidavits to the effect that fifty-seven
electors voted first choice for me in
precinct No. 42 of Suwanee county,
when the first returns from that pre
cinct gave me only forty-five.
If any ballots were in part tamper
ed with in Madison county, it was
done without, my knowledge or con
sent, directly or indirectly. I have
taken, and do now take, the position
that such charge should be investi
gated by a grand juryr or other com
petent tribunal, and the guilty parties
punished, if there is guilt. Mr. Catts
HIS CASE TO TIE DEM-
OF FLORIDA
has stated that a detective has discov
ered that the boxes were opened at
midnight, etc. .
PROBABLY ANOTHER PHILO
y- GUBB
If such is the case, the detective
should continue his investigation, and
ascertain who opened them and fur
nish the proof. Nobody would be
more interested or anxious than I
to have the offending parties brought
to justice and punished to the full ex
tent of the law. -THE
HAYES LEWIS INCIDENT
I have been informed that Mr.
Catts, in speeches recently made at
Madison Lake City and other places,
has related what Hayes ' Lewis had
said was the substance of an inter
view between Mr. Lewis and myself
at Mr. Lewis' office in Jacksonville.
As reported to me, Mr. Catts said in
those speeches that at said interview
Lewis told me that he understood that
I had sent a telegram to some attor
ney in South Florida to the effect that
such attorney need not do any more
down there, that I had had enough
done (meaning that I had had enoufih
ballots changed) in West Florida;
that I at first denied any knowledge
of such telegram, but afterward ad
mitted to the whole thing; that I
broke down and cried and asked
Hayes Lewis not to- give me away,
and that he, Lewis, became indig
nant and ordered me out of his office.
If such was the substance of Mr.
Catts' speeches . iu the places: men
tioned, I wish to say that a more
malicious bundle of lies never passed
from the lips of any man. I had an
interview with Hayes Lewis in which
he asked me if such a telegram had
been sent. I told him that no such
telegram or communication had been
sent by me or by my authority, and I
say now that no such telegram was
ever sent, and I defy Lewis or Catts,
to produce any such telegram or show
that any such telegram was ever de
livered to or transmitted by the tele
graph company at my request or at
the request of any one acting for me.
DETAILS WILL BE GIVEN
At some other time I shall give to
the public the whole sum and sub
stance of what was said in my inter
view with Mr. Lewis, but space here
forbids. I shall also lay bare to the
public what to my mind, are some of
the rottenest political frame-ups that
have ever been attempted in this
state. Suffice to say now that I have
in hand correspondence and affidavits
that lead me to the conclusion that if
any ballots were tampered with in
Madison county, the emissaries of Mr.
Catts deliberately did it, or had it
done, in order that he might charge
that it was done in my behalf, and
might now use it as political thunder.
CATTS THREATENS AN INSUR
RECTION ' - -
I am also informed that Mr. Catts
in a speech made in Lake City on .last
Monday night, said in substance that
he had. been nominated as the demo
cratic nominee for governor, and that
there was not sufficient power In
heaven above, or earth, or in hell be
low, to deprive him of the nomination.
That I might be declared by the courts
to be the lawful nominee, but that he
intended to appeal his case to the peo
ple notwithstanding, and that, if after
the November election, he wasnot de
clared to be elected, he would gather
around him ten thousand good and
true citizens of Florida, with white
badges on their right arms, rifles on
their shoulders, march to Tallahassee
and be seated in the governor's chair.
I am also informed that in a speech he
made at Live Oak the number given
was five thousand, but by the time he
reached Lake City it had grown to
ten thousand. In the article appearing
in the Metropolis on Friday, August
4, quoted I from above, it was stated
that Mr. Catts expected to get twen
ty-five thousand signers of his peti
tion to coerce all state and county of
ficials and officials-elect into support
ing Mr.Catts, and having his name
put upon the ballot in November? If
Catts army, bent upon defying the
law, and the decisiones of our courts,
and the intimidations of state and
county officials and officials-elect, con
tinues to increase in the same ratio
from now until the November election

Harrison declared the attacks' js-ere

perchance he should be actually seated
jguvcnior oi xnis stare.
PARTY WILL BE PURIFIED
The content which I am makimr to
demonstrate that I was duly nominat
ed at the late primary election has
proceeded far enough to show that'
one of two things will result:
First That if, after I have won my
fight for an honest and accurate re
count, I am elected governor in No
vember, the democratic party of this
state will be purified of the undemo
cratic elements which have beer wear
ing the cloak of democracy for many
years past, and this state will have
four years of true and tried democ
racy, with scrupulous observance of
the inalienable rights of the people In'
their persons, property and liberties
according to- our constitution and
laws, or,
OR FLORIDA WILL BE IN A
STATE OF ANARCHY
Second That if I . am not elected
governor in November,tMs state will
witness an administration of radical
ism and disregard of the law that will
outdo Blease in South Carolina in his
palmiest days, or anything this state
has ever been treated to since it elect
ed its last carpetbag governor.
From now until after the general
election it is going to be up to the
i ue democrats of this state to say
which of these results shall come to
pass. - - - -
KNOTT IS FOLLOWING DEMO
CRATIC PRACTICE
The rank and file of true democrats,
and a great majority of the public
press of the state are with me in my
ight. A few, without mature consid
eration, have criticised my action as
undemocratic. Section 55 of the demo
cratic primary law, passed by a dem
ocratic legislature, upheld by demo
cratic courts, expressly provides for
the kind of contest I am making. Two ;
circuit courts have already said so,
and the supreme court, which i3 now
weighing its opinion in regard to my
petition for a recount in Putnam
county, will7 if I am not badly mis
taken, again say so in no uncertain
terms within the next few days.
Again, my contest is not without
democratic precedent. In 1876 George
F. Drew, the apparently defeated can
didate, by means of a contest in the
courts was declared duly elected, and
thereby overturned carpetbag rule in
this state. In my opinion if the man
from Alabama, who has assumed to
question the integrity of our courts,
and defy their J decisions, is finally
elected we shall have a return of con
ditions a3 bad, if not worse, than those
of carpetbag days.
AV TTNTSWF.RVIVn DEMOCRAT
No man can say that I have not al
ways been a true democrat. For years
I have rendered honest, efficient and
faithful service to my state. Doe3 it
not seem strance that after all these
years of unquestioned nonesty and in
tegrity, a stranger from Alabama at
tempts' to prove to the people whom I
have served that I was a party to or
would endorse any dishonest act?
CATTS IS A BULL DOZER
Another very serious question are
the true democrats of this state go
ing to admit that this man from Ala
bama has obtained such momentum
and such power that he can, even be
fore he has attained the power of the
chief magistrate "of the state, bulldoze
and browbeat every county and state
official of the state into giving him
support?
1 -t -At- il T . .1 ,
favorable to me, the recounts already
applied for will be speedily disposed
of. I shall then ask for my certificate
of nomination, and call to my stand
ard all true democrats of this state. I
am not making this fight for myself
alone, but in behalf of the true de
mocracy of Florida, and I ara confi
dent that the loyal members of the
party will stand by roe until the vic
tory is finally won.
Respectfully, W. V. Knott.
