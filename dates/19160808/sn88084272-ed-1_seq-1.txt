DEFENDS WILSON
HIG1 POLIGYi
Representative Harrison
Speaks in House for
His Chief.
Washington, D C- Aug. S. Replying
to Republicrn criticisms of president
Wilson's policy in the house today,
representative Harrison of Mississippi
declared that the attacks were prompt
ed by a desire to create a false cam
paign i"ue rather than to see the pol
icy changed.
Mr. Harrison mentioned particularly
former justice Hughes's speech accept
ing the Republican nomination and
speeches In congress by senator A. B
Fall and representative Rodenberg of
Illinois. He interpreted Mr. Hughes's
statements as meaning that he would
have recognized Huerta, would not
have issues munitions embargoes, and
would have mterened in Mexico
"If Mr. Hughes were president," he
added, "the country would be at war.
and instead of a sky reflecting the
color from the furnaces of prosperoui
factories, it would be reflecting red
streams of blood from noble youths."

questions will be taken up.
Sisensa Border Trouble First.
The Carranza government wants to
take np the border situation first
through, the proposed Joint interna
tional commission, but Is willing
that other matters should be dis
cussed later. Eliseo Arredondo, am
bassador designate, so outlined the
Mexican attitude today to actlny sec
retary Polk, who took the information
to. the cabinet meeting.
It was indicated that state depart
ment officials were satisfied with the
situation and the appointment of Amer
ican commissioners might be expected
any time.

ment in his last note that the com-

Dr. Polk took the matter to the cabinet.
