WASHINGTON, Aug. 7. National defense legislation In con
gress is rearing completion. Today the conference committee on
the army appropriation bill submitted a complete agreement and the
offerees on the naval bill voted to disagree on the big construc
tion program and personnel increases the only remaining points
of dispute in that measure, so that the issues might be referred
back for uick settlement by the two houses.
President Wilson, navy department officials and other ade
quate defense champions of the, a dministration, are expected to
make a determined effort to induce house leaders to yield to the
senate program for construction of 66 vessels, eight ofthem to be
capital ships, during 1917. The house provided for only five capital
ships. If it votes to insits on its original provisions, it is said the
.senate conferees will offer to give up the three-year continuing
plan in the senate bill as an inducement to house leaders to re
consider and accept the big program for the first year.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 7. Organiza
tion of the new farm loan board which
is to administer the uew rural credit
system, was perfected ehre today with
the induction into office of its four
appointive members, the designation
by President Wilson of an executive
head and the selection of a secretary.
The board will meet again tomorrow

irs and C. E. Lobdell, Herbert Quick
and W. . S. A. Smith, the other ap
pointive members in the office of Sec
retary McAdoo, who is ex-officio mem
ber and chairman. Mr. McAdoo made
a brief speech pointing out that the
farm loan act was the first legisla
tion to provide financial aid for farm
ers on long time and easy terms en
acted since the foundation of the gov-ernir-.nt
nd declarig it meant more
prosperity for the farmer and more
in conseuence for everybody else.

New German Submarine
Believed Near Maine
(Sy Review Leasew Wire.)
PORTLAND, Maine, Au;.'. 7. Every
point along the Maine coast was
Wntched shsrply today and tonight
for two submarines believed to be
foreign vessels and possibly the long
expected German merchantman Bre
men and a consort.'
The strange vessels were reported
four miles off Cross Island, near Ma
ch!as, and close to Canadian waters
todrry, hy t coast guard lookout, but
no word had reached here tonight to
bear out the emphatic declaration
from that stption that they were un
der sea craft ani were proceeding at
top speed toward the west. The vigil
slorg the coasf extended as far eat
as Halifax, N. S.. and, St. John, N. R.
both of which poits reported that
Iliitish navsl auxiliaries had no In
formation regarding 'the presence of
the submarines in these waters. Dur
ing the afternoon a thick fog moved
in from the sea. and made extended
observations impossible.
The navy department announced
that no American, submersibles were
off the Maine cooast.
Information from teliable sources
that no British submarines were
cruising in these water seem to cre
ate the impression that the bubma
rines are the Bremen ard another of
her type.
Another possibility considered was
th- coast guard crew, might have seen
the Deutschland, driven out of her
course, or else stic';ing closely to
shore, ''aptairs of incoming craft re
ported that they had not seen any
submarines.

Dozen Aviators To a Side Now Often "Mix It"
In Skies 9000 Feet Above the Battlefields
, (By Review Leased Wire.)
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aug. 7. (Via London)
The aviators felt the concussion 9,000
feet In the air today when a brigade
of British aeroplanes bombarded Ilen
in Litarde. (northeast of Arras) with
a shower of 112 pound bombs.
When the German sheds and store
houses at Martinpuich were fired by
incendiary bombs a vast pillar of
smoke from the conflagration t'ose to
a height of ROno feet.
The work of the British aviators re
cently has surpassed the wildest
flights of imagination. Aerial tlichU
which attract general attention are
'.inly an incident of the offensive ram
' paisn Overwhelming numbers of
! planes are concentrated on the mi'r
j raw front of the Sonime battle in .-o-
ordination with a superior volume of ;
i gun fire. The planes move in largrr
'ami larger flotillas and there hHve ,
been cases with a dozen engaged in .
battle on either side. j
I The German first line and second
line trenches, headquarters billets and j
.supply depots of all kinds have been
; tAmhed. the aerial offensive being
.limited only by the number of planes
,and the sunnlr of bombs. Not a vIM
lage occupied by the Germans in the
1 neighborhood of the front that has
r.bt its aerial bombardment, according
to accounts. Barges and motor trucks
have been set on fire: one moving
train was blown up.
The dry official accounts of the
aviati'.m corps and their aviators re
veal a number of amazing feats every
day. A pilot describes an experience
thus:
"I first attacked a Roland, but find
ing a Fokker behind turned and
maneuvered under his left. He fired
one drum at very close range and the
Fokker nose divide and went down
with a spin.
"If It had gone down direct, it
w'juld have been a 'crasher.' "
NEW YORK, Aug. 7. Lincoln
B. Palmer, iiiAiiaer of the Auier-

though private and governmental
laboratories had been seeking
for years to find a suitable substi-
tute (or wtod pulp ia the manu-
facture of paper, L'jtning had as
yet been produced that would
stand the test.
"If the German; have solved
the problem," he said, "they w ill
have rendered tlie I'nited States
a valuable service, and it ought
to bring millions to the inventor
of the pi'jeess. The discovery,
if true, should prove a boon to
the paper manufacturing indus-
try in this country." '

, DETROIT. Aug. 7. Charles E.
t Hughes, in the first set speech of his
'trans-continental trip, tonight assailed
the administration vigorously for its
i foreign policy. Its Mexican policy, for
appointing men whom he termed in
experienced to diplomatic posts, and
for what he characterized as a "raid
upon the civil service of the I'nited
! States."
Was War at Vera Cruz
j "He kept us out of war." Mr.
Hughes said, referring to the
j president and Democratic slogan.
j "Yet he seized Vera Cruz. That
was a war very ignoble war. And
It was called war over the bodies
of those dead soldiers: it was
, called a war of service.

who knows today what the policy of
the administration will be thre
months hence? Mr friends, the trouble
' Is that this administration has written
: such a record that no matter what it
says you do not know whether it will
stick to it.

j that American rights In Mexico are

' Mr. Hughes assailed the administra
tion's course toward nrhoiding Amer
' icnn rights abroad during the Euro
' pean war. .
Where America Ends
i "When 1 say that I am an American
i citizen," the nominee said, "I ought
to say the proudest thing that any
! man can say in thij world. But you
can't have that pride if American cit
