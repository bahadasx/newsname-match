by sound American policies and those
are what we purpose to have.
"There Is one other thought I want
to leave with you. and It is this: Do
not let us get this country Into a low
patriotic plane so that we are content;
content with the disesteem. with the
scoff of th? world. I am an American
citizen, ought to be the proudest tlOe
In the whole world."
NO COUNCHMANIC
ACTION ON TAXES
Only Five Members of the
Body Turned Up Last
Evening.
The Common Council of 'he city
of Fairmont which was to have met
last evening failed to present a quor
um. the necessary nine out of sixteen
being four abort.
But five showed up and waited for
the arrival of some more as Important
business was on hand. Cleric of the
City Council Alben J. Kern waited
with the faithful five but no more
showed up and after passing remarks
concerning the war. the price of cot
ton and the Annabelle explosion, they
went home.
The council chamber was empty be
fore those who came to coach from the
sidelines were aware 'hat there was
a gathering but no council meeting.
The effect of this defaut is to give
effect to the action of the Board of
Affairs to Increase ttfe tax levy of the
city of Fairmon' to sixty cents, an
Increase of five cents over the previ
ous year. The increase was made,
according to the papers in the case for
what is known as "current expenses."
This means paving, laying of sewers
and anything that the city wishes to
do and has not otherwise provided
for in the way of 'axation.
Besides this extra levy, the paving
of Morgantown avenue which is to
cost $32,000 and the paving of East
Park avenue which is to cost $4.SCO
provided for in ordinances drawn up
by the Board of Affairs, also become
law by default.
City Hall Notes
The city Board of Affairs, with Stan
E. Miller to furnish information. Is
busily engaged today in making the
levy for the ensuing "year. The desks
and tables, and some of the chairs in
the Finance commissioner's office are
packed high with pamphlets, papers,
books, pads and pencils. Although it
looks as though the papers could not
be gotten together for several weeks
the Board feels that by evening the
new estimate should be ready.
Letters continue to reach City Clerk
Kern asking for information concern
ing Jobs in this section and he invari
ably refers them to some employer, ex
cept the city. Xone that have request
ed Jobs have been told that Davy
Dean needs 20 men or that Dominick
needs 25. Kem feeling that commerce
is more important than repairing
sreets sends the new workers to the
mines.
The report of the condition of the
water pumps about the citv was held
up temporarily until the rush is over.
By the rush is meant the rush of the
city employes to make a place for the
money to be spent by them this year.
One of the stranges things that May.
or Bowen has to contend with is the

City to Punish
Careless Dealers
The city has started a campaign
against decayed food stuffs and in all
cases intends to punish the owner of
the store in which it is sold.
Mayor Anthony Bowen last night
fined H. S. Stern of the Star Cash
meat market on Madison street. The
fine amounted to but $10 but is thonght
sufficient for a starter and as an eye
opened for other merchants.
The meat which Stern sold Satur
day night was taken by the purchas
er to the health department and found
to be rotten. Fish, kidney and spare
ribs were all bought at the same time
and each piece was putrid when it
reached the city health officers.
Stern denied most vigorously that
the food was unwholesome when it left
his hands. He pointed out that the
sale was made at 6 o'clock and that it
wa8 after 10 when it was submitted
to the health officer. He produces wit
nesses to prove that food bought at
bis store Saturday night, tome of it
sold very late that night was perfect
ly good the next morning.

facturer!
"Plenty of ice to k?ep baby's milk
cool and fresh, and mother's tea
cold and father's lemonade frosty:''
is the cheering message that local ice
manufacturers have for the people of
; Fairmont. Daily reports of suflering
| in nearby cities ana towns from ice
famines during the present hot weath
i ter, have not alarmed Fairmonters, as
: this city is especially wc'l supplied
with this, at present, most desirable
j commodity.
In addition to supplying the needs
j of all local ice consumers the two lo-1
| cal com pan' are even bhiping ice
I to all points in northern West Vir
ginia and as far as Bridgeport and
Bellaire Ohio. The local plant of
[ the Marion Products company has a
capacity of 60 tons of ice daily an?
i for some time this plant brs been;
I running at top speed. With ten wu
gons and trucks busy all day dis
| tributing i"e to individual consumers
in t^e city this company also supplies
i ice to all of the Baltimore and OLio
! t-ains that pass over this division.
All of the big refrigerators on cars
1 are re-iced frere and all of the pas
i senger trains take ice at this place.
! This company ships both ice and ice
i cream to Clarksburg, Grafton, Mor
! gantown, and as far East as Deer1
' park and Ett.ins. -lafcvmi-cariMAs
ice are being shipped dSBy during this
hot spell. Each or his a capacity
of about 20 tons of the 30 pound j
i cakes.
The Fairmont Ice company's new j
1 l_nt. near the river on the Palatine :
side, also has a capacity of 60 tons of |
ice per day- and in addition to their
local trade this company is shippping
many car* ads each week to Whel
ing and the Ohio river towns. De
mads for ice are insistent and other
cities will pay almost any price for
an adequate supply.
Howe er in spite of the demands |
of other cities both of the local com- j
panies are endeavoring to supply lo-|
cal consumers first and at the same i
price that is cnarged during the en-;
tire veer. This is the customary 10
cents* per hundred pounds, although j
better rates are made to wholesale
consumers.
The ice man as he makes his daily
rounds in Fairmont is the most wel
come visitor at all of the residences.
Two trips with the wagons each day
are made c ? i*ost of the streets and
the ice is delivered promptly to every
one.

SKINNERS' TAVERN
I
Some Mystery About the
Way Fire Department
Was Summoned.
The fire chiefs car and the fire
tract started down Washington last
night at 10:30 o'clock to answer a call
to Skinners Tavern. When the track
arrived Mr-iger Ben and his son j
were sitting in front of the hotel and
as the track stopped they asked the
fireman where the flre_ was. When
told that Skinner's Tavern was afire
Mr. Beii was greatly surprised as u<>
ahd nnu in no alarm. But the fire
men went through the buiiding and
tound the fire in the dumb waiter
shaft running from an old abandoned
kitchen to an unused dining room.
The only conjecture which has any
standing with the firemen is that the
dry timber under the hot tin root
above the kitchen became inflamma
ble during'the intense heat of the past
two weeks and yesterday caught fire.
They figure the fire had been spread
ing all day doing but little damage un
til it reached the top of the dumb
?waiter. At this point it burned until j
the firemen were called.
Just who called the firemen cannot
be learned but It is the opinion of
the firemen that the person calling
became excited, was unable to tell
where he was talking from and la
ter was ashamed to admit the fact.
The fire was a hard one to fight,
the tin roof having to be chopped oft
before the lames could be reached.
The firemen were on the Job one
hour. The damhge waa slight. Thia
mad* the third fire la a* many night*.
