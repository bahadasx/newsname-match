Good Attendance and Goo
Prevail? Congressiora
Held on
Saturday afternoon was another of
the many camraign ax * N^wh^rry has
had since the hunting season opened?
office hunting.
The* candidates for congress for the
third district ami the candidates for
solicittor for the judicial circuit
spoke in the court house Saturday
afternoon, County Chairman
Frank R. Hunter, presiding.
There was almost a capacity
house, nearly every seat being
' taken. -Several ladies graced me occasion
with their presence: The audience
was quiet and attentive and each
candidate was given an impartial
Ihearng. There was some general
Jiand clapping at times, but nothing
on the yelling and foot stamping order
^t any time during the meeting.
All the candidates for congress were
present except Mr. Aiken who is in
Washington.
Mr. Henry C. Tilman was the first
speaker and devoted a goodly part 01
fcis time answering the argument of
*'too much. Tillman" which some of his
opponents had used against im. He
said that when four Tillmans responded
to their country's call in
1847 to go to Mexico where three o<
them now sleep in foreign soil; and
when the Civil war broke out; and in
1876 when nadical rule was overthrown;
and in 1890 when the common
people followed the lead of a Tillmar..
there was not in th.ose times a cry of
k ""too much Tillman."
& IMt. Tillman favored a rural credits
system where a poor man could borW
crow 75 per cent or 80 per cent of the
true valuation of the land at a low
rate of interest. He said this was not
a wild cat theory because as t3ie payments
were made the debt would be
reduced and as the end of the pay^
raents approached the land would be
V worth more than at the start. These
payments ougnt to extend over a
W period ot from 20 to 35 years which
p *would give every deserving poor man
an opportunity to own a home. He
favored a preparedness program that
would produce an efficient army and
an adequate navy equal to that of
L any other naval power in the* world.
1 He was opposed to a large standing
army but favored the establishment
of military training schools all over
V the country where the youth of the
land could receive iniltary training at
W the same time that they were obtaining
literary and industrial training.
I This would give the country an immense
reserve army which could be
M called out and organized on short
W notice.
A. H. Dagnall spoke in compliment<
ary terms of the Ladies present. Was
running on his own merits and had
1 nothing- to say against nis opponent?.
He thought historic family names
should not be -considered but that
ability and fitness should be the guiding
choice of the people. He favored
a refund by the federal government of
the cotton tax exacted from the farmers
of the south at the close of the
vit of Secession and ?aid this would
(provide a sum sufficient to give ail
confederate veterans now living
$.^00 and $30.00 per month the rest
of their lives. He said this wouid
forever set at rest the question of
pensions for the old vets to Tvhom the
south owes so much.
I He would introduce a bill to prohibit
the intermarriage of whites and
negroes in Washington, opposed the
distribution of seed by the government
and called it a political scheme
for gettinar votes. FTe favored strict
economy in governmental expendi
tures, favored preparedness by the
inauguration of a well trained army
and-navy and stressed the importance
I of a merchant mirine in the interest
I of American trade. TTe scored federal
A courts and the power of federal judges
^pp.nd closed bv citinz his experience
V ard -success at the Anderson bar.
"Mr. Fred H. Dominic1* said he did

J
i ol ask .his home people to vote for
j him solely because he-was j. home
! man but to vote lor him it they
; thought him The best man in the race.
He spoke of the long tenure in office
; of the Tillmans and Aikens and rej
ferred to the other candidates whose
j ancestors were war veterans. He said
j the Dominick family also had a war j
j record of which he could boast but J
j that he was not running on the war j
! record of his ancestors. Mr. Dominic*
, | charged that dirty politics was startled
against him 2 years ago when the
j speaking tour had closed thus affordj
ing him no opportunity to answer the
j charges on the stump. He read an ex|
tract to show that the charges were
i unfounded and that he had been ex
honorated of any wrong doing.
He spoke of his record in the At
I torney General's ofilce as assistant .
Attorney General and his success ia .
handling te State's cases before the .
j courts. He said that he was ia demo- j.
j crat and as such he was in favor of
i preparedness, rural credits, a restrict- ,
j ed immigration, etc.
Mr. Dominick was handed an imI
mense bouquet of hydnangeas at the ,
! close of Tiis speech.
I John A. Horton scored Domiaick
i and the rest of the bunch for their 1
{ criticism of him and of each other ,
j and said that if the criticise got ,
j much sharper the bark would slip j,
j somewhere. He said he pleaded guilty j .
j of being a bank president and also of j
' being successful and thought the gov- !
j ornment needed good business men. j.
j He thougnt there were too many law- j,
J yers in the state and national legisla- j
; tures. Mr. Horton said there were !
j only two classes ofl people in the
j world, the class which produces the
[ wealth of the world and the class j j
J which lives upon the profits derived j
| fromWhat we&lth. He was in symI
nathv with labor as he had been a la
boring man himself. He spoke in ^
favor of labor unions and was oppos- ^
ed to a system of blacklisting as is ,
practiced by some mill corporations. ^
| Predicted that labor unions would }
I sweep the south as they had already ,
i c one the New England states and the (
: iAnnor the hctf-or W-o thoiicrht imrni- !
I gration should be entirely cut out as
j pauper labor from Europe would pour
, into this country after the great
; European war and force American .
| labor to the wall. This competition ,
i he said would give capital the ad- .
j vantage of cheap labor and the laborI
ing man would suffer. He favored j
jsystem of rural credits at a low in- i
i terest rate and said that 8 per cent on ,
! . , . . ,
; large land loans would rum any man. 5
As Mr. Aiken was not present this j
completed the list of candidates for
j congress. The candidates for soiici- ,
j tor were next introduced and spoke ! r
| in the following order: ~ !
, Mr. T. Frank McCord reviewed 2;is
i record as a lawyer for the past three
years having graduated in law in 191%. ,
( Ke thought the people wanted a. man .
| of chamcter and afciHty for solicitor. .
, Thought that as Newberry had once .
i " i
, been honored with a solicitor and as j,
Laurens had also beer, thus honored
that it was Greenwood's time and
