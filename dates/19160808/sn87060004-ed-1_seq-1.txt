has been forced to pay a secret iu
demnity to Germany for her failure
to maintain strict neutrality. The
indemnity exacted is understood (o be
$22,000,000.
The offensive occured this spring
when the Baltic Sea was invaded by
a submarine. To enter the Baltic
from the North Sea, it was necessary
to pass through Danish waters, which
are strongly guarded by forts. The
Germans secured evidence that the
English submarines could not have
entered the Baltic without the per
mission of the Danish Government.
Of all the Scandinavian countries,
the Danes are the strongest sympa
thizers with the Allies and have the
strongest antipathy to Germany.
