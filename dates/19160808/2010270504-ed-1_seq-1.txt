EZRA MEEKER Sl'tiNDS
YESTERDAY IX TOWN
Ezra Meeker, Oregon pioneer, who
has given the greater part tof his
time for a dozen years past In se
curing a marKlng of the old Oregon
Arall and is now working for tho build
ing of a national highway from Wash
ington, D. C. to Seattle, Wash., along
that old trail, spent yesterday in town
while enrouto west. This Is tho fourth
trip Mr. Meeker has mado, ovor tho
Oregon trail, the first having been
made in 1852. A dozen or more years
ago ho conceived tho idea of making
a trip east over the old trail and using
his influence in securing and erect
ing markers along the route. He trav
eled with a team of oxen and a
prairie schooner, tho same as was
used in the daya of pioneer emigra
tion, and succeeded In arduslng much
enthusiasm in tho causo ho champion
ed. To furthor advanco the work ho
later mado a second trip, and as final
result tho trail is now well marked by
nionumeiAfs all tho way from tho
Missouri river to Oregon.
In this his last trip Mr. Meeker is
traveling by alto tho top of which is
oullt somewhat in the shapo of a
prairie schooner, with a trailer at
tached that carries his camp equtp
page. At all towns on his route Mr.
Sleeker stops to discuss his proposed
highway with Commercial bodies and
Invites their support and Influence
in behalf of the bill now pending be
fore congress. This bill was introduc
ed In . tho present congress and It
calls for an appropriation of $75,000
for a slurvey of tho route. If this bill
passes and the survey made, a bill
appropriating money for tho construc
tion of tho National highway will bo
introduced.
Mr. Meeker mado a short address
beforo tho Chamber of Commorco at
4he luncheon at the Owl cafo yes
terday. : :o: :

actually necessary, but is along the
line of "safety Hrst," and does not
entail any great amount of incon

from six tubes sent to the chemist
by Commissioner Welch, and tho con
