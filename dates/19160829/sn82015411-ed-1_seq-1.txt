REACHES HOME TO
FIND FOLKS GONE
The Advertiser tells the follow
ing story:
"Have you ever come home to
find that you no longer have a
home?" asked circuit Judge Lyle
A. Dickey of Kauai who arrived in
the Maui yesterday morning from
the Garden Island.
"This is my sad plight," the
jurist continued, explaining why he
' is now a guest at the Colonial.
"Father's gone to the mainland
for an extended visit and rented the
old homestead to a stranger. I land
ed this morning, made a bee line
for home and was there informed
by an unfamiliar face and voice that
dad was not living there at present.
"This explains how 1 came to be
a guest at a city hotel for the first
time in my life. I'm now going
through the experience."
Judge Dickey is here for two
weeks. His commission for circuit
judge of Kauai expired some time
ago and he is now holding over un
til ho is either reappointed or suc
ceeded in office by some one else.
So far as is known there is no ap
plicant for Judge Dickey's place and
his reappointment is almost certain,
his friends say.
Rats As Type Thieves
Taking stock of some oJ his best,
new type last week Manager Hopper,
of Tiik Gakdkx Island, discovered
that almost the whole of one case
had disappeared. There had been
" a burglary without doubt ! Whom
and where was the thief? Mr. Hop
per was almost ready to interview
the slieriiT on the matter, when he
thought to look under a big furni
ture cabinet. There the type was
found big piles of it. It was plain
that rats hail carried it there.
"What in thunder did rats want
to do witli that type anyhow"? he
demanded of the ollice boy.
"I 'spose they want to learn how
to set type after hours" was the
laconic rejoinder.
The type was carefully rearranged
in its proper place and a war de
clared on nits that would make yes
terday's declaration by Roumania
look like a hiking order of the Boy
Scouts.
Mr. H. I. Spaulding is again at
Kealia, having arrived in the Ki
nau Thursday morning reaching
Honolulu a few days before from
California. He was accompanied
from Honolulu by Colonel Z. S.
Spalding and Manager (iaylord P.
Wilcox, of the Makee Sugar Com
pany, who were in the city in con
nection with the Makee-Lihue Plan
tation Co. deal.

pearing for the first battalion; Com
pany F, of Kealia, the second bat
talion; Company I, of Makaweli,
the third battalion, and (last but
not least) the hospital corps. In
asmuch as these four teams have

tween them may be expected. The

Captain Smythe, of the Company
G team, has a bunch of swift play
ers and is very anxious to arrange a
series with any military aggregation
and battle for honors. This is a
fine chance for any company team
not in the finals.
Captain Hadfield still has his hat
in the ring for a boxing match.

AGO DEN
KAUAI POLOISTS
II TRYOUT GAM
AS PLANS DEVELOP
FOR TIME IN HILO
Everything points to a mot suc
cessful civic convention and county
fair at Hilo on September 21, 22.
23, 2-1 and 2.". The arrangement
are all perfected and everybody con
nected with the two big affairs di -elare
that Hilo is going to put up
a record for actual business accom
plished and entertainment arrangid
for the visitors to the Crescent Bay
City.
The various committees are work
ing hard on their parts of the pit -gram
and, one and all. the men -hers
say that things are lining up in
good shape.
The Inter-Island Steamship Com
pany has quoted a reduced rate for
round trips from the different is
lands to Ililo. Kauai people will he
able to visit Ililo and return to the
Garden Island at a twenty-live dol
lar rate. That is a great reduction
and it will cover the trip from Ka
uai to Honolulu to Ililo and back
over the same route.
Maui folk can avail themselves of
a round trip ticket which will cost
twelve and one-half dollars. In both
cases the Kauai and Maui people
must see to it that at least fifteen
delegates make the trip. Otherwise
the reduced rate will not apply on
the steamers. It would be advis
able to make reservations as soon as
possible as it is certain that there
will be a large rush of delegates
seeking stateroom accommodations
on the Manna-Kea.
The civic convention opens in
Hilo on Thursday morning, Sep
tember 21, at nine o'clock. The
whole proceedings will be. over by
Monday afternoon. During their
stay in Hilo the visitors will have a
railroad excursion to Laupahoehoe,
a trip to the Volcano, a trip through
Puna, a dance, a banquet, a mins
trel show-provided by the Honolu
lu Ad Club and a dozen other fea
tures that will keep them busy and
amused when not working on con
vention matters proper. The ladies
who visit Hilo will be specially en
tertained by the committee appoint
ed to look after them. Card parties,
afternoon teas and other features
will be provided for the visiting
ladies. They will, of course, also
be taken on the railroad and auto
mobile trips.
The county fair plans are going
ahead well and the prospects are
that the huge Kuhio Bay Wharf
will be crowded with exhibits of all
kinds. Entries are rolling in and'
it is predicted that every section
will be filled. Beautiful silver cups
and gold medals have been donated
as prizes for the fair and the win
ners will be very pleased with the
tiophies they eaptuie.
Silva's Store Burglarized
Silva's Eleele Store was broken
into again sometime during last
night, and watches and other arti
cles of value stolen. Entrance was
gained this time through one of the
front windows. Sherilf Rice detail
ed, police officers on the ease early
this morning. The police are in
clined to think that the burglar is
an old thief who was recently dis
charged from jail.
The Koloa School
Principal Bush, of the Koloa
school, will return from Honolulu
tomorioiv morning.
During the summer the main
building of the school was re-painted
to harmonize with the cottages
and the premises put in excellent
ordei the thoughtfulness, it is said,
of Supervisor McBryde.
