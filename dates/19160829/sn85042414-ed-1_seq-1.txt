GREEK GENERAL HOPES
TO AID THE ENTENTE
Athens, Aug. 26.—(Via London,
Aug. 29.)—General Constantine Mos
chopoulos, the new chief of staff, ex-
Sope
ressed to the Associated1 Press the
that his eleven months' close
association with the allied forces dur
ing his command of the Greek troops
at Salqniki, and cordial relations be
tween' himself and General Sarrail
and the British generals, and his per
sonal knowledge of the difficulties of
the problems confronting the entente
allies in Macedonia would strengthen
the good relations between Greece and
the allied powers and dispel any mis
understanding which had arisen.
"I think I can be a precious advo
cate of the entente," he said.
General Moschopouios will go to
Salonlki Sunday to remain several
days. He will confer with the French
commander in chief before returning
to take up his duties here. Satisfac
tion with the appointment is wide
spread. It is generally felt that it
will bring to an end much that the
allies found unsatisfactory in the di
rection of the Greek army.
The fighting between the Serbs and
Bulgars around Cornite continues
desperately. This point is regarded
as the key to Verona, and the Serbs
are making every effort to hold it.

MSON ASKS CONGRESS TO GIVE
APPROVAL OF INCREASED RATES
WANTS POWER TO DRAFT ENOUGH
"Having failed to bring the parties
to this critical controversy to an ac
commodation, therefore, I turn to
you, deeming it clearly our duty as
public servants to leave nothing un
done that we can do to safeguard the
life and interests of the nation," he
said. "In the spirit of such a purpose
I earnestly recommend the following
legislation:
"First, the immediate provision for
the enlargement and administrative
reorganization of the Interstate Com
merce Commission along the lines
embodied in the bill recently passed
by the house of representatives and
now awaiting action by the senate in
order that the commission may be en
abled to deal with many great and
various duties now developing upon' it
with- a promptness, and thoroughness
which are, with its present constitu
tions and means of acting, practically
impossible
"Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day in which a legal basis
alike of work and of wages in the em
ployment of all railway employes who
are actually engaged, in the work of
operating trains in* interstate trans
portation.
"Third, the authorization of the
appointment by the president of a
small body of men to observe actual
results in the experience of the adop
tion of an eight-hour day in railway
transportation alike for the men and
railroads in its effects and agreements
to new conditions and in all other
practical aspects with the provision
that the investigators report their con
clusions to congress at the earliest
possible date, but without recom
mendation as to the legislative action
in order that the public may learn
from an unprejudiced source just
what actual developments ensued.
"Fourth, explicit approval by con
gress of consideration by the inter
state commerce commission of an in
crease in freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered
necessary by the adoption of an eight
hour day and which have not been
offset by administrative readjustment
and economies should the facts dis
closed justify an increase.
Fifth, an amendment to the exist
ing federal statute which provides
mediation, the concilation and arbi
tration of such controversies as the
present by adding to it the provision
that in case the methods of accommo
dation now provided for should fall a
full public investigation of the merits
of every such dispute shall be insti
tuted and completed before a strike
or lockout may lawfully be attempt
ed.
"And sixth, the lodgement in the
hands of the executive of the power,
in case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such
rolling stock of the railways as may
be required for military use and to
operate them for military purposes
with authority to draft Into the mili
tary service of the United States such
train crews and administrative offi
cials as the circumstances required
for their safe and effective service.
"This last suggestion, I make be
cause we cannot in any circumstances
suffer the nation to be hampered in
the essential matter of national de
fense. At the present moment, cir
cumstances render this duty particu
larly obvious. Almost the entire mili
tary force of the nation is stationed
upon the Mexican border to guard our
territory against hostile raids. It must

MENTOHANROABSFOR DEFENSE
Particularly Demands Authority to Force Executives and
Men, Who Now Cannot Agree, into Operative
Work to Safeguard Country.
Washington. Aug. 29.—President Wilson laid before congress this
afternoon the entire railroad strike situation. After reviewing the ne
gotiations and pointing oat the danger of the threatened strike to the
entire country, he recommended the immediate enlargement, of the In
terstate Commerce Commission in order that. that, hod.v may be enabl
ed to handle the various duties devolving upon It the establishment of
an eight-hour day the authorization or the appointment by the presi
dent of a body to observe the workings of the eight-hour day system
and its effects the approval by oon grese of consideration by the Inter
Btflc Commerce Commission of the increase In freight rates, and an
amendment to the existing statute providing for the public Investigation
before the strike is called.
"And sixth," said Wilson, "the lodgment In the hands of the execu
tive of power, in case of military ne cessity. to take control of such por
tions of the railways as may be required for military use. with authori
ty to draft into military service such train crews by administrative of
ficials as the circumstances may require."
Pointing out the distress and hard
ships. which a nation-wide strike
would bring, Wilson laid special stress
on his request that congress empower
him to draft into service the very
managers and men who have been un
able to adjust their differences so the
government may operate the roads in
RAILROAD PRESIDENTS SAY THEY
CANNOT SURRENDER EKHT-HOUR
DAY WITHOUT A FAIR HEARING
Washington, Aug. 29.—The railroad presidents today w* a
KIIIIVMIII. saying:
"We were unable after the most earnest consideration to agree
with President Wilson's proposal to accept without arbitration the sub-
arbitration.
"We do not assent to the statement thai the eight-hour day now
undoubtedly has the sanction of society In Its favor. Society not jet has
recorded its judgment upon the subject.
"As the trustees Iter the public served by our for the great
masrf of less powerful cmidoyes (not less than eighty percent of the
whole number), interested In the wage fund, the trustees also for
millions of people who have invested savings In the stocks of these
properties, who vitally are interested to the extent of millions of dol
lars, In the lnt£grfty and solvency of the railroads of the cooatry, wo.
cannot in aonsdence surrender without a bearing the principle Involved
nor undertake the transfer of an enormous cost resulting to the-U

be supplied and steadily supplied with
whatever it needs for the maintenance
and efficiency. If it should need be.
for purposes of national defense, to
transfer any portion of it upon short
notice to some other part of the coun
try for reasons now unforeseen, am
ple means of transportation must be
available and available without delay.
Power conferred in this matter should
be carefully and explicitly limited to
cases of military necessity, but in all
such cases should be clear and ample.
"There is one other thing we should
do if we are true champions of arbi
tration. VVe should make all arbitrate
and award the Judgments by the rec
ord of a court of law in order that
their interpretation and enforcement
may lie, not with one of the parties to
the arbitration but with an impartial
and authoritative tribunal.
"These things I urge upon you, not
in haste or merely as a means of meet
ing' a present emergency, but as per
manent and necessary additions to the
law of the land, suggested indeed by
circumstances we had hoped never to
see, but imperative as well as just if
such emergencies are to be prevented
In the future, I feel no extended argu
ment necessary to commend them to
your favorable consideration. They
demonstrate themselves. Time and
occasion only give emphasis of their
importance that we need them now
and we will need them."
The president, in presenting all the
details of the two weeks of negotia
tion to congress, recounted how he
had laid before both sides the picture
of distress into which the strike would
plunge the nation and how he had
assured the railway 'managers that
the public would see that justice was
done them
"They have thought it best," said
he. referring to the railway man
agers. "that they should be forced to
yield if they must yield, not by coun
sel, but by the suffering of the coun
try.
"i
"While my conference with them
was in progress" the president con
tinued, "and when to all outward ap
pearance these conferences had come
to a' standstill, the representatives of
the brotherhoods, suddenly set a
strike for the Fourth of September."
Thus the president summarized his
efforts and added:
"But 1 could only propose. I could
not govern the will of others who
took an entirely different view of the
circumstances of the case, who even
refused to admit the circumstances to
be what they have turned out to be."
He, then, followed with his recom
mendations for legislation. Represen
tatives of the railway managers and
of the brotherhoods sat in reserved
seats in the galleries and heard the
president make his address.
How his recommendations are to be
carried out, Wilson left entirely In
the hands of congress.
The house and senate joint session
listened Intently to every word of the
address.

AIRCRAFT NEEDED
EOR US. NAVY
War Game Demonstrates
Vital Importance of
Aeroplanes.
Washington. Aug. 29.—Commenting
on the big naval war game played last
week. Rear Admiral Benson, chief of
operations, said the vital lesson
demonstrated was the need of aircraft
for scouting purposes and also the
urgent necessity of adding battle and
scout cruisers to the fleet.
Although the aeroplane ship North
Carolina participated in the game as
a scout none of her hydro-aeroplanes
was regarded as safe for use at sea.
Admiral Benson said the problem of
finding the best type of pontoon for
the machines, minimizing the danger
on landing, was being given attention
by navy experts and the results were
to be expected soon.
The department is still without In
formation as to' the part played In
the game by Rear Admiral Helm of
the submarine flotilla. Admiral Ben
son declared, however, that when the
department's plan for establishing
submarine bases along both coasts,
with a fleet of submarines stationed
at each, such a result as the landing
of hostile troops, the mission which
the red fleet, under Admiral Mayo
theoretically accomplished, would be
impossible.
The progressive schedule of war
games for the navy contemplates a
great joint operation with the army
in studying out the problem of meet
ing an enemy. It was Impossible to
attempt any such maneuver this year
as the army Is busy on the Mexican
border.

Pctrograd, via London. Aug. 29.—
Rumania's declaration of war against
Austria is regarded in official circles
as of far-reaching significance. The
foreign office points out three striking
benefits—the aid of the substantial
Rumanian army, which, pitted against
Austria, will lessen Russia's task and
will afford greater freedom of action
on the left wing on the western front,
the tightening of the ring around the
central empires and the opening of
a new line of attack: the cutting off
of grain supplies to the Austro-Ger-
mans, upon which the latter are be
lieved to have placed local reliance.
Recent dispatches from Bucharest
indicated that the sale of the entire
Rumanian crop had virtually been ar
ranged for and in that shipping of
the grain had already begun.

PRESIDENT WANTS LEGISLATION
GIVING EIGIIT-IIOUR DAY ALSO IS
AFTER INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE ACT
Will Ask Measure Giving Executive Power to Operate
Trains—Developments Came Rapidly
Throughout the Day.
Washington. Aug. 29.—The summary of develop
ments in the strike situation follows:
Negotiations between the railroad brotherhoods,
through President Wilson, definitely have been broken off.
Brotherhood leaders definitely ordered the strike to
begin at 7 a. m. Labor Day, unless the order is counter
manded. Only a settlement favorable to the men can
change it.
Wilson prepares to go before congress at 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon with proposals of a new law to prevent a
strike.
The latest authentic outline of these proposals follows:
Increase of the Interstate Commerce Commission
from seven to nine members.
An eight-hour day law for railroad employes in actual
interstate transportation. To empower the Federal Board
of Mediation to fully investigate the operation of an eight
hour day on railroads.
Empowering the Interstate Commerce Commission
to consider an eight-hour day in connection with making
rates.
A measure similar to the Canadian industrial disputes
act for investigation of all disputes between railroads and
their employes.
A measure empowering the president to operate trains
with the primary object of providing American troops on
the Mexican border with food.
Brotherhood leaders favor the eight-hour day fea
tures, but oppose the proposal to adopt the Canadian plan.
Washington. Aug. 29—Wilson will
address congress in joint session on
the railway strike situation at 2:30
o'clock today. The president reach
ed the decision soon after the meet
ing of hrotherhood heads had come
to a conclusion on the latest proposal
of the committee of railway presi
dents to avert a strike pending an in
vestigation. Their decision was not
announced, but Wilson's action in de
ciding to address congress is inter
preted plainly as meaning that they
had rejected it.
While Wilson's decision to address
congress was being announced, the
brotherhood leaders changed their
tentative order for a strike on Labor
Day to actually ordering a strike at
that time, unless it is called off by a
satisfactory settlement.
After conferring with Chairman
Newlands of th£ senate interstate
commerce committee, the president
announced his decision. Word was
sent to the senate and house leader
to arrange a joint session. Wilson
will lay before congress a definite
plan of legislation for dealing with
the situation.
The plan of legislation Wilson will
