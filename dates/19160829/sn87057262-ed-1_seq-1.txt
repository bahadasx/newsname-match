j.
president Wilson to Appear Before
Congress and Aak That 8teps be
Taken to Prevent the
Walkout.
fBy Robert*" J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON. Aug. 29.—The end
of President Wilson's efforts to nego
tiate peace between the railways and
the railway brotherhoods was ex
pected todar.
Having exhausted every means of
bringing the two parties together on
some common ground and prevent a
nation wide strike, the president was
prepared to seek through legislation
what apparently cannot be accom
plished by. persuasion.
The situation goes to congress.
The conference last night with both
the railway brotherhoods, and the
iw*r estfftntfrfes d«wbfceK-otrty
that neither side would yield anything.
The president then began work at
ance on the message he will deliver
htfare a Joint session of congress to
m/ or tomorrow to recommend legis
lation designed' tv delay the impend
ing strike or bring it to a quick end
If it is In full swing before congress
passes the laws In juestlon.
Danger of the strike again became
•cute today. The brotherhoods at
the white house last night refused to
agree at the president's urgent re
quest, that the strike order calling
for a walkout of 400,000 trainmen at
7:00 a. Labor day, be recalled.
The railway executives Informed of
this later, assumed a defiant air.
"There's going to be a strike. That's
certain. Let's have it. It will clear
the air. And that's the only thing to
do now," one prominent railway presi
dent declared. "It will show the peo
ple of the country what is really go
ing on in the Industrial world."
Earlier In the day the executives
lad called at the white house. They
did not present to the president "the
first and final" proposal of the execu
lives for peace—what was in effect a
complete rejection of any and all por
tions of the president's proposition.
The president urged them to delay
presenting that document—a virtual
ultimatum—until he had formulated
certain ideas he had in mind regard
ing legislation. During the confer
ence, which lasted nearly an hour,
the railways Informally left another
idea, namely that a commission be
named by the president to investigate
all issues in the present dispute for
three or four months.
This was regarded in all quarters
as being unsatisfactory and entirely
unacceptable to the brotherhoods and
was expected to be finally rejected by
them today.

BE REJECTED
Brotherhood Chiefs and the
Executive Committee Agree
to Turn Down Railway
Presidents'Plan.
DECISION GIVEN TODAY
Wilson's Proposed Disputes Law is
Called Greatest Throttle of
Labor Which Was Ever
Devised.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.—The four
brotherhood chiefs and the twenty
four members of the executive com
mittee today agreed to reject the pro
posal of the railroad presidents as
made to President Wilson yesterday.
No formal announcement was made,
but It is known this action was taken.
"We will submit our decision to the
president today," said President Lee,
of the Brotherhood of Trainmen.
The moraing meeting heard the re
port of the four leaders on their con
ference with the president last night,
at which they told him their final pur
pose, though they did not report spe
cifically on t)ie railway president's
proposals.
The brotherhood heads explained to
day they have no authority to rescind
the Strike call for September 4. The
resolution, adopted Sunday before the
640 representatives left for home,
they said, gave them authority to fix
the date and hour of the strike "un
less prior to the day and hour so
flx^Unotlf».«baU -have -tjeei* .received
that flie proposal of the president of
the United States, accepted by us,
August 18, has been aocepted by the
railroad companies."
It is understood that the executive
committee of twenty-four, to whom
fun powers were delegated by the
president, could grant such aids to
the four leaders, but that it has thus
far withheld it
Brotherhood leaders feel that Presi
dent Wilson's proposal for an eight
hour day law will be a greater burden
to the railways than to the men. Un
der It, a vast number of non-onlon
men would automatically become
eight hour men, and while the broth
erhood men would get only eight
hours—and no increase in pay—they
believe the economic pressure caused
by such a system would weigh more
heavily on the railroads than grant
ing the president's demands.
"Misery loves company," said a
prominent leader. "The railways' rea
son for refusing the men's demands
is purely economic. Our reasons con
tain humanitarian elements, so if the
railways must include In the eight
hour day the men whom they call the
down-trodden eighty per cent, they
will be suffering twenty times to our
one."
President Wilson's other proposal,
creating a law similar to the Canadian
dispute acts is generally opposed by
the brotherhoods.. They call it "the
greatest throttle of labor" ever de
vised.
"While the law provides that no
action shall be taken by either side
pending investigation," said a leader,
•'experience in Canada shows that
capital always has taken advantage of
the Investigation period to prepare for
a strike. The Canadian act is named
for Lemleux. We have been 'lemleux'
too many times."

Advance guards of this Rumanian
force have crossed the 'Hungarian

^before news of the Rumanian decla

The first official statement report

already are stiffening the Austrian
lines along Rumania's frontier.
The whole Balkan war theatre has

SALONIKA, Aug. 29.—Cheere went
up all along the 140 mile front of the
allies in the Balkans when news of
Rumania's declaration of war was
flashed to the battle front from Sa
lonika
The first word was received here
early yesterday. Bulletins were dis
played In the troop camps and the
news was rushed on to the front.
Thousands of small slips of paper,
carrying word of Rumania's action,
were hastily printed and carried to
the front by Anglo-French aviators
to be showered behind the Bulgarian
lines.
Must Leave Albania.
ROME, Aug. 29.—Complete evacua
tion of Montenegro and Albania by
the Austrians will be the first result
i»f Rumania's entrance into the war,
rtalian critics asserted today. The
early collapse of the dual monarchy,
possibly by the end of the present
year, was predicted by a majority of
the Italian war experts.
Despite denials from Vienna, it has
been learned by the Italian military
authorities that Austria has with
drawn nearly a whole army corps
from Montenegro and Albania within
the past six weeks to check the Rus
sian and Italian offensives. The new
menace on the Transylvanian front
ier will force the withdrawal of the
remainder of the Austrian forces, it
Is believed here, leaving only Bulgar

Italians.
Serious economic troubles as well
as internal disorders in Hungary, are
expected to foUow a successful Invas
