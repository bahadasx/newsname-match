MAY ASK CONGRESS

Seeks to Force Eight Hour
Day By Law Commission
to Probe All Difficulties
Washington, D. C., Aug. 28.—
The railroad presidents' commit
tee of eight conferred with Presi
dent Wilton an hour and after
ward Hale Holden, as spokesman,
said that a statement would be
given out by the executive* inside
an hour but that it would not be
a final statement.
Mr. Holden indicated that the
plan of the executives to present
the president a written statement,
practically turning down his plan,
had been changed. Mr. Holden re
fused to state whether the execu
tives planned to see the president
again or to Indicate their plans In
any way.
W. G. Lee, head of the train
men,' today Issued a statement de
claring that the brotherhoods had
no intention of arbitrating the
eight hour work day.
Washington, I). C., Aug. 28.—Presi
dent Wilson's negotiations for avert
ing the threatened nation wide rail
way strike are in the last stage with
a break or a settlement apparently not
far off.
With the railway executives stand
ing firm against conceding the eight
hour day and the brotherhood leaders
still standing out against arbitrating
It, the hope of preventing a tieup of
the country's transportation, systems
seemed to lie with congress.
Just exactly what can be done none
of the congressional leaders them
selmes seem to know. Conferences
among them and with President Wil
son, which began last night, were conr
tinued today. The president postpon
ed his engagement with the railway
executives from 10 o'clock this morn
ing until 2:30 o'clock this afternoon
to give him more time for conference
with leaders la congress.
The situation was viewed on all
sides as the most perilous since nego
tiations began two weeks ago.
President Wilson's plan for break
ing the deadlock between the railroads
and their employes, as discussed in
conferences today, was as follows:
An eight hour law for railroads
to become effective at a date far
enough in the future to give the
railroads opportunity to prepare
for It.
A law patterned after the Can
adian act which creates a com
mission of investigation and pre
vents lockouts or strikes while an
industrial dispute Is being Investi
gated.
To Refuse Plan.
This plan was discussed by the
president with his party leaders In
congress as the basiB for the next step
after the railroad managers have for
mally announced their refusal to ac
cept the plan of settlement the presi
dent previously proposed. They »e'e
expeoted to do this at 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon at a white house con
ference.
Meanwhile congressional leaders
gave up hope of adjournment this
week. Senator Newlands and Com
missioner Chambers of the federal me
diation board conferred today with
Acting Attorney General Todd about
the legislative program but all denied
that any legal measures for preventing
a strike had been discussed.
To Go Before Congress.
While the president has not finally
given up hope of bringing about an
agreement through direct negotiations,
he is going forward with his prepa
rations for going before congress with
his plan of legislation.
It was understood today that many
proposals of different form have been
presented to the railway executives
through the white house but that they
have all been met with the statement
that the railroads stood for arbitrating
the whole controversy.

CHIEF STRENGTH OF NEW BEL.
LIGERENT, HOWEVER, 18
STRATEGIC POSITION.
Paris, Aug. 28.—Rumania is the
fourteenth nation to Join in the war.
Her intervention either on the side of
the entente allies or the central pow
ers has been awaited with symptoms of
concern by both since the beginning
of the great conflict. This is due not
entirely to Rumania's military strength
but also to the strategic advantages of
her geographical petition and the fact
that her entry into the struggle opens
to the Russian army a gateway
through to Rumania to attack the Bul
garians from the north, while the al
lied army having its base at Saloniki
attacks them and their German allies
from the south.
Nevertheless, Rumania's military
strength is by no means inconsider
able. The country has a population of
6,800,000 and her army has been esti
mated at 580,000. It often has been
described as one of the most thorough
ly equipped and disciplined armies in
Burope but recent information from
Bucharest has thrown some doubt up
on its quality. Lately it has been stat
ed that Rumanian officers are ill train
ed and undisciplined, that Rumania
has no heavy artillery and that its
flying service is inferior. Some advo
cates of Rumania's participation in the
war have asserted that she could mo
bilize as many as 1,004,000 men. The
mobilization of the army, in progress
for months, was a few days ago re
ported to be complete.
The motive which prompts Rumania
to enter the war is the satisfaction of
her "national aspirations," described
by Take Jonescu, the Rumanian liber
al leader, as the "policy of national in
stinct." Concisely, this means nation
al expansion. In the southern half of
Bukowina, the Austrian crownland,
the Rumanians are the dominant race.
The mass of the people of eastern
Transylvania, a part of Hungary, is
Rumanian by race and language. It
is said 4,000,000 Rumanians live in
Transylvania.
Rumania has been credited with a
long cherished ambition to annex
these provinces and at the same time
"liberate" the Rumanians now under
Austrian domination. Recently it was
reported Russia had offered Czerno
wlti to Rumania as a reward if she
would unite with the entente.
Rumania also covets Bessarabia, the
extreme southwestern province ofRus
•la on the Black sea, which was taken
from her by the Berlin treaty of 1878.
Reports have stated that Russia also
has consented to restore Bessarabia as
a war prize, with Its population of
2,000,000, mostly Rumanians, and an
area of 20,000 square miles. This with
Transylvania would give Rumania a
total population approaching 13,000,
000 and, should all her aspirations be
satisfied, a territory as great in area
as that of England, Scotland and
Wales.
GREEK8 SHOW SYMPATHY.
Athens, Aug. 27. (via London, Aug.
28.) —Fifty thousand Greeks joined in
demonstration before the residence
of Venlzelos, the former premier, to
day and cheered him with boundless
enthusiasm when he urged them to
send a committee to King Constantino
to urge him to support the present
government and prepare the army for
a possible rupture of existing condi
tions."
Addressing the multitude, Venlzelos
said:
"Last week I summoned you to a
demonstration to show you what to do.
Now I exhort you to send a committeo
before the king and to say to him:
'Your majesty, you were the victim
of persons who persuaded you there
would be a German victory and you
thought you could violate the consti
tution. The people do not approve of
these facts. The reservists telegraph
you that they are ready to follow you,
because they think you always will
remain neutral.
'Elections are neoessary but you
must not use your influence politically
because the results would be destruc
tive. The present government is ab
solutely necessary. The premier (Alex
endar Zaimis) is an excellent man.
You should give the government full
political authority. You must now
show the entente powers most benevo
lent neutrality and exercise the army
in preparation for a possible rupture
of existing conditions. The liberal
party is confident as regards your po
sition.'
In concluding, Venlzelos declared:
"I think our desire will be favorably
accepted otherwise I^will do my best'*

HARD FIGHTING ON

Little Change in Situation
oi| the Somme, Partly Due
to the Bad Weather
Berlin, Aug. 28. -—Fighting has
begun between Rumanian and Teu
tonic troops on the Translyvanlan
frontier, the official announcement
of today Indicates. The statement
says Rumanians have been taken
prisoner.
The announcement says the Ru
manians were captured en the
Transyivanlan frontier.
Berlin, Aug. 28. —Germany has
declared war on Rumania.
London, Aug. 28.—Rumania has en
tered the war with the entente allies.
Official announcement is made at Ber
lin that the existence of a state of war
with Austria-Hungary was proclaimed
in Bucharest yesterday evening.
The. military situation in the Bal
kans now becomes of preponderant In
terest. It is to be expected that Ru
mania will follow a plan of campaign
mapped out by the high council of the
entente powers, whether against Aus
tria-Hungaria or Bulgaria or both. An
indication that Rumania moved In ac
cordance with a predetermined plan
of the entente allies is found in the
fact that her declaration of war was
made on the same day as Italy's dec
laration against Germany.
The official announcement from Ber
lin says that on receipt of the news
of Rumania's action the federal coun
cil was called for an immediate ses
sion. This may forecast a declaration
of war by Germany against Rumania.
The constitution of the German empire
stipulates that the emperor may de
olare war If defensive but when war
Is not merely defensive he must have
the consent of the bundesrath or fed
eral council.
Athens dispatches indicate that
popular feeling is stirred deeply by
occupation of Greek territory by Bul
garian forces, although this move was
sanctioned by the Greek government.
On the Macedonian front the Bul
garians, claiming consistent gains on
the western end of the line, are leng
thening the front and pushing into Al
bania.
Along the front in France there has
been renewed British activity north of
Barentin-le-Petit, northwest of Ginchy
and south of Thiepval.
Paris says German attacks in the
Verdun sector were repulsed.
The Russians have again started an
offensive In the Riga region. In the
Carpathians, the Russian have made
afresh advance at Koverla mountain,
near the Hungarian border.
In the Caucasus Petrograd reports
a Russian success over the Turks
along the Masladarasi river.
On the Italian front the Austrians
are heavily bombarding positions at
Vallone. In the Carnlc Alps the Ital
ians have taken several Austrian posi
tions.
TURK DRIVE 8TOPPED.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 28.—The
Turkish drive toward Persia, aimed
apparently to outflank the Russian
army operating in Armenia, is report
ed in dispatches received here today
to have been held up at Woe, by heavy
Russian reinforcements.
The foreign legations in Teheran,
though still disturbed, have not yet
fled from the city. This report, taken
in conjunction with the recent Russia?
successes at Bitlis and Mush, i3 in
terpreted as removing danger of a
Turkish outflanking movement against
Russia or of an Invasion of Persia.

Germans Angry At Count Von Jagow
For Permitting Italy And Rumania
To Declare War.
London, Aug. 28 —Italy's declaration
of war against Germany and the dec

Austria-Hungary have caused a most
profound impression in the German

adds, express themselves bitterly
against Gottlieb von Jagow, foreign

CRAIN ON DECKS
Duluth, Minn., Aug. 28. —With her
decks covered by a mountain of loose
grain, hiding half the deckhouse, the
big steamer Livingstone, Capt. H.
Oertling, came into port early today.
Local marine men looked on in amaze
ment at the unprecedented sight.
The Livingstone, under charter to a
Minneapolis grain firm, loaded at Ft.
William late Friday. When the cargo
holds were filled there still was a
quantity of grain to be moved and the
vessel was not carrying capacity ton
nage. So, taking a chance on .the
weather, 300 tons more grain was pour
ed on the deck.
There was hardly a puff of wind
to stir the chaff on the way up.
"One hard puff of wind would have
cleaned the decks," said Capt. Oertling
as the steamer went under the spouts
today.
