TOBACCO
Will Immediately Affect the
Farmers of This Dis
trict FORCIBLE LETTER FROM
HON. W. T. FOWLER
Bon. W. T. Fowler, (he Republi
can candidate for Congress from this
District, is the author of the follow
ing forcible letter dealing with the em
bargo placed on tobacco by England:
To the Tobacco Growers of the Dark
Tobacco District:
The now ' infamous "Order In
Council" which made the Dark To
b:cco District near bankrupt last
year has been re enacted. The effect
of this Order is to put an embargo
on all shipments of dark tobacco to
Germany or Austria after August 31
This will include what is termed
Scandinavian Europe, Denmark, Hol
land, Belgium and Switzerland also
Sweden and Norway. These coun
-tries under normal conditions purch
ase at least 100,000,000 pounds of
our dark tobacco. Scandinavian Eu
rope takes her requirements largely
through Bremen. Germany produc
es a large portion of her consump
tion. So does Austria and Hun
irarv. For two years, or since the
war bejan, this production has bfen
greatly curtailed. Their stocks of to
bacco are exhausted. Germany and
Austria, therefore, on a free, open
market would take one third of our
large crop of tobacco at a high figure.
England has a low, selfish purpose
in cutting off shipments of tobacco
to Germany and Austria. Tobacco
is not an article of contraband, be
cause it is not a food or war neces
sity. Every dollar that Germany or
Austria puts into tobacco lowers her
financial efficiency just this much.
England is furnishing the finances for
Italy and France. Italy and France's
production of tobacco is practically
cut off on account of belligerent con
ditions According to a government
Teport France will need and require
out of this crop double her usual
purchase. Italy for her own con
sumption and for the need of the Re
gie governments will require a large
increase over her average purchase
England is underwriting the finances
of both countries. If market in the
"Black Patch" is allowed to open
with the active, aggressive competi
tion which the German and Aus
trian buyers will afford, England
with its acute financial eye sees that
the French-Italian purchase will cost
from forty to sixty millions more
money than if competition is throt
tied. Thblack lis? on tobacco,
therefore, is not a war measure.
It's a shrewd financial policy, con
ceived by a cold, calculating finan
cier. It is purely English in all its
characteristics. The plan in all its
features is premeditated to take sixty
millions out of the pockets of the
dark tobacco growers and put it in
the British coffers; and to hide the
infamy of this damnable burglary by
proclaiming it to be a war measure.
The Government at Washington
can give relief. Shall the tobacco
grower be exploited and his sweat
money taken away - under the very
eyes of Congress without a protest or
a demand to "stop thief?" Shall
Kentucky and Tennessee farmers be
thus victimised and required to bear
the burdens of a European War?
The recent Merchant Black List
promulgated by the English Gov
ernment has been .modified, jo that
same is no loiwr objectionable
This was the result ot a vigorous
protest from Washington', and a
threat of retaliatory measures. The
embargo on tobacco shipments tokl. II. Windsor lu the Saptem-
Oermany and Austria can be re
moved "in the same way. If our
Government will only say to Eng
land that this embargo must be lifted
or the Government of the United
States will be forced to prohibit all
or certain grain shipments on and
atter August 3lst, then no one
doubts the result. If Washington
wavers or vacillates, the embargo
will remain until the war ends.
In the condiion that confronts us
the Federal Government is the only
power that can step between ana di
vert a financial disaster. Delega
tions of strong men fiom Mayfield,
PadUcah, Murray, Ilopkinsville,
Clarksville, Springfield, Guthrie
Elkton llussclville, Madisonville
and Henderson are leaving today for
Washington for a conference with
Senators and Representatives on
Monday. Delegates are being sent
from Virginia and North Carolina.
Nothing will be left undone or lun-
said to emphasise the importance of
the situation. We believe that Con
gress and the President will take
action, and that relief will come in
this way. If Congress stops to de
bate and adjournment should find
the embargo intact, the only alter
native remaining to the' tobacco
grower, as occurs tojme now, is for
the growers themselves to adopt re
taliatory measures 'by refusing to
sell England or her allies a pound of
tobacco until she lift the embargo.
If I can find time I shall ,, report
from Washington the results of the
conference.
Yours for success,
W. Tt FOWLER.

"Print Paper Prices
The Federal Trade Commis
sion is meeting with a good deal
of difficulty in investigating the
advanced prices and shortage of
uews print paper. A statement
issued by the Commission says
that some publishers hesitate
answering the Commission's in
quiries, fearing that their sup
plies may be cut off. The Agn
cultnral Department says that
investigations made by the For
est Service indicate that is plenty
of raw material from which to.
manufacture paper. The devel
opment of new paper mills has
been held back by the uncertain
ty regarding markets, since it is
thought that with the close of
tho war manufacturers of annua
nitiou will withdraw aa purchas
ers of many products now used
by them, Consequently new
paper manufacturers are not
keen to rnn the risk of decreased
demands.
