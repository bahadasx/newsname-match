the railway presidents
have thought it
best that they
should he forced to yield, if they
must yield, not by counsel, hut by
the suffering of the country." Preset
Wilson today appealed to congress
to enact drastic legislation to pre
vent the threatened railway strike.
Py implication, he criticized the
brotherhood representatives for call
ing a strike while negotiations still
were in progress, hut made it plain
that when this action wa. taken, the
conferences were at a standstill.
The president in person addressed
congress a follows:
"Gentlemen f the congress:
"I have come to ask your .'resist
ance in dealing with a very grae
situation which has arisen out of
the demrnds of the employes of the
railroads engaged in freight train
service that they he granted an
eight-hour working day, safeguarded
by payment for an hour and a half
of service for every hour of work
beyond the eight.
"The matter ha.s been arariW for
more than a year. The public has
been made familiar with the de
mands of the men and the argu
ments urged in fawr of them and
even more familiar with the objec
tions of the railroads and their
counter demand that certain privi
leges now enjoyed by their men and
certain bases of payment worked
out through many years of contest
be reconsidered, especially in their
relation to the adoption of an eight
hour day. The matter came some
three weeks ago to a final issue and
resulted in a complete deadlock be
tween the parties.
Mean Proidl rail.
"The means proided by law for
the mediation of the controversy
failed and the means of arbitration
for whith the law provides were re
jected. The representatives of tho
railroad executives proposed that
the demands of the men be submit
ted in their entirety to arbitration,
along with certain luestions of re
adjustments as to pay and condi
tions of employment which seemed
to them to be either closely asso
ciated with the demands or to call
for reconsideration on their own
merits; the men absolutely declined
arbitration, especially if any of their
privileges were by that means to bo
drawn again in question. The law
In the matter put no compulsion
upon them. The 400, no) men from
whom the demands proceed had
voted to strike if their demands
were refused; the strike was im

Scc.- Duty to Imriio.
"Just so soon that it became evi
dent that mediation under the exist
ing law had failed and that arbitra
tion had heen rendered impossible
by the attitude of the men, 1 consi.l-
red it my duty to confer with the
representatives of both tlie railways
and the brotherhoods, and myself
offer mediation, not as an arbitrator,
but merely as spokesman of the na
tion, in the interest of justice, in
deed, and as a friend of both par
ties, but not as judge, only as the
representative of one hundred mil
lion men, women and children who
would pay the price, the incalcul
able price, of loss and suffering
suffering should these few men in
sist upon approaching and conelud
ing; the matters in vontroeisy be
tween them merely as employers
and employes, rather than as pa
triotic citizens of the United States
looking before and after and accept
ing the larger responsibility which
the public would Iut upon them.
t Sees "Society's Sanction."
"It seemed to me in considtring
tlie subject matter of the controv
ersy, that the whole spirit of the
times and preponderant evidence of!
recent economic experience spoke for'
the eight-hour day. It ha- been ad
judged by the thought and exper
ience of recent years a thin? upon
which society is justified in insisting
as in the interest of health, ef
ficiency, contentment and a general
increase of economic igor. The
whole presumption of modern ex
perience would, it seems to me, bo
in it. favor, whether there was ar
bitration or not. and the debatable
pohnts to settle were those which
arose out of the acceptance of the
eight-hour day rather than those
which affected its establishment, I,
therefore, proposed that the eight
hour day be adopted by the railway
managements and put into practice
for the present as a substitute for
the existing 10-hour basis of paj'
and service; that I should appoint,
with the permission of the congress
ft small commission to observe the re
sults of the change, carefully study
ing the figures of the alt'red operat
ing costs, not only, but also the con
ditions of labor under whuh the
men worked and the operation of
their existing agreements with the
railroads, with instructions to re
port the facts as they found them
to the congress at the earliest pos
sible day, but without recommenda-J
tion; and that, after the facts had J
been thus disclosed, an adjustment,
should in some orderly manner boj
sought or all the matters now pit
unadjusted hetven the railroad
managers and the men.
In Line With Court
"These proposals were exactly in
line. It is i ".ten-sting to note, -..ith
the positior. taken by the supreme
court of the United States when ap
pealed to, to protect certain liti
gants from the financial losses
which they confidently expected if
they should submit to the regulation
of their charges and of their meth
ods of service by public legislation.
The court has held that it would n )t
undertake to form a judgment upon
forecasts, but could base its action
on!y upon actual experience; that
in the way -f immediate approval
d the resolution. It was hoped
that the matter could be taken be
fore" the next council meeting but
it is not expect'd that the resolution
will reach the e-ity fathers mtil late
next month.
Delays I.levation.
Two weeks ai:o the board express
ed the desire to complete the plans
and approve the plans Tuesday.
The snag in their plans only delays
the eventual elevation of the tracks
as tlie council is expected to ap
prove the resolution after it passes
through the hands of the board ed"

what I cannot but regard as the

the favorable judgment of society,
the representatives of the railway

declining a peaceful settlement
which would nguge all the forces
of justice, public and private, on

They fear the hostile inlluence of
