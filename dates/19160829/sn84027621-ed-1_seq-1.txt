To Avert from the Country the Hardships of
a Great Railroad Strike
1 MANAGERS AND ill ARE STUBBORN AIID FAR APART, ID
Washington, Aug. 29. President
Wibon will address a joint session of
Congress on the railway strike situa
tion at 2:30 this afternoon.
STRIKE LABOR DAY
While President Wilson was an
nouncing his decision, brotherhood
leaders changed their tentative order
for a strike Labor Day to actually
order . the strike at that time unless
it is called off by satisfactory settle
ment. The previous order required
the transmission of a secret signal be
fore it became effective.' Unless Pres
ident Wilson and Congress find a way
to prevent it, a strike will now start
Labor Day without further notice!
Labor Day falls on Monday, Septem
ber 4th.
WILSON WORKING TO AVERT IT
Labor leaders admittedly acted in
the belief that some means are being
8ough to prevent actually calling the
strike. The think their action an
ticipated any possible legal processes.
President Wilson talked over propos
ed legislation, including , the eight
hour: day and a commission for the in
vestigation of railway disputes and
the prevention of strikes and lockouts
pending investigation with Senator
Newlands, chairman of the Senate
commerce committee. The president
also discussed legislation authorizing
the president to draft men into fed
eral service for the operation of rail
roads in case of a strike. President
Wilson still hopes direct negotiations
will succeed.
NEGOTIATIONS PRACTICALLY
CLOSED
Direct negotiations between the
railroads and employes through Pres
ident Wilson were practically closed
today. The executives refused to ac
cede to the proposal the president
made yesterday and presented him a
statement denying the judgment of
society favors an eight hour day and
declared that arbitration was the only
proper way to settle industrial dis
putes. President Wilson's suggestion
for proposal including the principle of
an eight-hour day, .but postponing its
effectiveness for a year pending in
vestigation was rejected by the ex
ecutives. CONSIDER WAGE STANDARD
The legislation program included
a resolution authorizing the Interstate
Commerce Commission to take the
wage standard into consideration' in
fixing freight rates.
PRESIDENT APPEALS TO CON.
GRESS
Washington, Aug. 29, 2:45 p. m.
Pointing out the distress and hard
ships a nation-wide strike would bring
on the country, throwing thousands of
men in other industries out of work
because of paralysis of freighti trans
portation, Mr. Wilson asked Congress
in joint session this afternoon to act
in the railway strike situation. He
asked authorization to draft the men
and managers involved so that the
government can operate the roads in
case of military necessity, also to en
large the commerce commission and
empower the commission to consider
the increased cost of an eight-hour
day in making rates. The president
asked for the passage of an eight
hour law, with the commission, investi
gating the effect and amend the me
diation law to prevent lockouts and
strikes pending investigations.
SCORED BOTH SIDES FOR STUB
BORNNESS ;
President Wilson detailed the two
weeks' negotiations to Congress 'and
recounted how he laid before both
the railroad managers and presidents
and members of the brotherhoods the
picture of distress into which a strike
would plunge the nation, how he- as
sured the managers the public would

THE ARCTIC
Temperature Seems Turned Upside
Down on Both Continents
this Summer
j (Associated Press)
Stockholm, Aug. 29. Travelers re
turning from the. north this summer
are complaining of the intense heat
prevailing at the southern edge of the
Arctic circle. Travelers to Russia,
who have had to make the journey by
rail all the way around the Gulf of
Bothnia, say they have suffered in
tensely from the heat while on the
northern reaches of their four days
trip.'
At Haparanda, where passengers
transfer from Sweden to Finland, the
temperatures this summer have rang
ed from 10 to 20 degrees warmer than
here in Stockholm, several hundred
miles to the south. This difference is
of course attributed to the longer
hcurs of , sunshine prevailing in the
north, Haparanda being but a short
distance from the zone of midnight
sun.' -
In company with the rest of Europe
Sweden turned up the clock one hour
this summer, although "daylight sav
ing" was hardly a necessity in this
land of long twilights and white
nights.. Daylight football games have
been played this summer beginning at
8:20 p. m., and eighteen holes of golf
have been possible after a 7 ' o'clock
dinner. "
see justice done them if "they thought
it best."
Referring to the managers the
president said that "they should be
forced to yield if they must, yield, not
by counsel, but by the suffering of the
country." ' ' '.
"While my conferences with "them
were in progress," continued Presi
dent Wilson, "and when to all outward
appearances these conferences had
come to a standstill, representatives
of the brotherhoods suddenly acted
and set the date of the strike for Sep
tember 4th."
PRESIDENT SPEAKS FOR THE
WHOLE PEOPLE
The president added: "But I could
only propose.' I could not govern the
will of others who took an entirely
different -view of circumstances and
of cases and who even refused to ad
mit the circumstances to be what they
have turned out to be."
President Wilson in the beginning,
told how he summoned both sides to
Washington merely as a friend of
both sides and in the interest of the
entire nation.' He detailed the plan
he had offered to both sides and which
failed to bring an agreement. He sug
gested the managers concede the
eight-hour day because it seemed to
him the spirit of the times and pre
ponderant evidence of recent economic
experience spoke for it. Therailways
refused because they feared the hos
tile influence of . shippers who woulo
oppose Jarger freight rates.
The president said the managers
based their decision to reject his coun
sel upon the conviction that they must
at any cost stand firm for the prin
ciple of arbitration, which the men re
jected v
Representatives of the railway
managers ' and brotherhoods occupied

OGALA, FLORIDA, TUESDAY,
T OF TIE
Oil THE
In not many months between 9,000
and 10,000 acres of muck, ranging in
depth from one to 30 or 40 feet, will
have been drained and brought under
cultivation in the valley of the Okla
waha in this county, between Heather
Island on the north and Lake county
on the south. This drainage will have
been accomplished by diverting the
river from its original bed. The total
acreage of muck in the district, drain
ed and undrained, will approximate
from 15,000 to 20,000 acres, some of
which is prairie not affected by the
river.
On the Mulan farms the muck cov
ers an area of about 3,200 acres. The
whole of it has never yet been put
under cultivation, but more and more
of it, is being cultivated every year.
There are 1100 acres of corn on it
this year, which promises to yield
anywhere from 50 to 100 or more
bushels. The Muclan farms are owned
jointly by Mr. Azel Ford of Washing
ton, D. C, and Capt. J. B. Young, of
Muclan. ...
South of the Muclan farms is the
Pine Bluff muck, , aggregating about
2000 acres, the drainage of which
Capt. Young expects to complete in
about two weeks. This tract lies be
tween White's , Ferry and Pine Bluff.
Mr. Ford is interested with Captain
Young in this. ;
South of the Pine Bluff muck is a
tract of about 4000 acres in which
Capt. Young, Mr. W. W. Condon of
Ocala, and Capt. J. B. Martin of Ok
lawaha, are interested. Work of
draining these acws is expected to
start shortly. j V
., There are probably no richer lands
than these muck tracts anywhere. Ad
joining them are high pine lands suit
able as ranges for live stock, food for
which can be produced without end on
the muck lands themselves.
The draining of these muck deposits
will assist materially in the develop
ment of the Oklawahaas a navigable
waterway from the Atlantic ocean to
the headwaters of the river among
the beautiful lakes of Lake county.
EMERSON STOCK SELLS
AS COMPANIES BLOOM
Bookkeeper Incorporators Form Four
Motor Concerns
If the Emerson Motors Co., New
York City and Long Island City,
produces cars with the speed and cel
erity with which it is turning out
stock certificates and subsidiary com
panies; it will be able tovmake Henry
Ford blush for shame. To date there
are four companies, the Emerson, ap
parently the parent because the first;
the Willis Truck & Tractor Co.; the
L. & S. Foundry and Machine Co.;
and the Consolidated Radiator Mfg.
Co., Inc. All these have incorporated
under New York laws for various
millions, the highest being the s Willis
company, capitalized at $12,500,000".
All of the companies make use of the
same offices in the Marbridge building,
New York City, and one or the other
of that, buildings' two addresses, 47
West 34th street and 1326r Broadway.
In each case the same persons are' in
corporators, and an investigation by
Automobile Topics has .shown these
individuals to have been drawn from
the Emerson bookkeeping, stenogra
phy and similarly important depart
ments. -
There is even an American Motor
Truck Co. using the same office as the
Emerson Co. and promoted by the
same brokerage house, C. R. Berry &
Co. One newspaper man who called
in an endeavor to straighten out the
tangle of incorporators and compan
ies was mistaken for a postoffice in
spector, and given scant information.
The tip thus given has been followed
up with the result that it has been
discoVered that the activities of the
Emerson company have been under
scrutiny of the postal authorities. In
the meantime stock of the five com
panies is being sold merrily by mail,
and the Emerison company has plac
ed a contract for the construction of a
$250,000 plant in Long Island City.
Automobile Topics.
In view of the interest created
throughout the country some weeks
ag by the announcement that the
Emerson "four" would be a more at
tractive car than the Ford, to sell for
less money, the foregoing article is of
timely interest. Automobile Topics is

MORE AMERICANS
French Find the Ambulance Corps of
the Greatest Help to Their
Fighters
(Associated Press)
New York, Aug. 29. The French
army authorities have reuested that
the American Volunteer Ambulance
Corps, which has done such valuable
service, be increased by - more volun
teers, according to a cablegram receiv.
ed from Richard Norton, commander
of the corps, by his brother, Eliot, of
New York. It has been asked that
Eliot Norton pass upon the ualifica
tions of any man who desires to vol
unteer for the corp, and he has arrang
ed to do this.
The corp began work in France at
the start ofthe war and for the" last
eighteen months it has been doing
regular, ambulance service for; one of
the French army divisions. Lately
the corp has received the distinction of
being mentioned in the general army
orders for "the constant devotion to
duty of its members and because it
has rendered the very greatest service
to the army division to which it is
attached in succoring the wounded in
the best possible manner."
The essential reuirements for vol
unteersare that they should be good
Americans, in sound health, capable of
withstanding hardships and doing hard
and trying work in caring for the
wounded with kindness and without
complaint. Volunteers should also be
good-tempered and capable of getting
on well with other men of all kinds and
conditions. In addition they must be
able to drive a motor and talk some
French. , The men already attached to
the corp have been principally
American college graduates from 25 to
50 years of age.
CHIMNEY IS COMPLETE
Arises Like a Little Eiffel Tower Over
Water Works of Ocala
The 100-foot chimney of the new
light and water plant has bee'n com
pleted, and surmounted with lightning
rods for its protection. The construc
tion was in charge of Joseph Banasiak,
a native of Ostrouuo, German Poland,
a master chimney builder, who has
been in this country three years and
four months.
Banasiak has built chimneys and
furnaces in Russia,' Germany, France,
Italy, Holland and the United States,
and has? besides, visited Switzerland
and Belgium. In Petrova, Russia, he
built a chimney 450 feet high, for a
lead smelting plant. He was two
years in Russia. He spent 27 months
in Monte Carlo, France, building gas
furnaces. In Italy he spent three
months building gas furnaces. He
was in Amsterdam, Holland, for 16
weeks working on a chimney for an
electric light plant.
According to Banasiak, the highest
chimney in the world is at Little Falls,
Montana, at a copper plant, and is 506
feet high. It has a diameter at the
bottom of 75 feet and at the top of
51 feet. It took 18 months to con
struct it. '.

London, Aug. 29. Desperate fight

Following Rumania's declaration of
war against Austria-Hungary and
Germany's declaration against Ru

King Ferdinand's troops are al

All
same English girl who on her tour
early this year in behalf of the Scot
tish Women's Hospitals in the East

money that on returning "she .
was hailed in the newspapers as the
"thousand-dollar-a-day-girl."
A mere slip of a girl of the type
that might be afraid of the report of
a rifle, Miss Burke, stood calmly by ,
the side of the officers in Verdun, and
while big shells were dropping about
watched the direction of a counter
attack that repulsed the enemy.
As a special mark of appreciation
of the splendid devotion of the body
of workers she represents and of her
own zeal in raising more than a mil
lion francs in support of hospitals
treating French soldiers, she was en
tertained by three great generals. Her
hosts were General Petain, the orig
inal defender of Verdun; Gen. Niyelle,
now in command of the army of Ver
dun; and General Dubois, in command
in Verdun itself. Miss Burke was
also received by Gen. Joffre. . At a

Allies and to the visitor's health were
proposed to the accompaniment of the y
