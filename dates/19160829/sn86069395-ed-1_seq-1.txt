PRESIDENT CALLS KERN
Tentative Plans Are Consid
ered to Lay Crisis Before
Session of Congress.
Washington. Aug. 28. Tentative
plans for a joint session of the senate
and house to hear President Wilson
ask for legislation to prevent the
threatened nation-wide strike were
discussed by- the president with
Senator Kern, the Democrat leader,
when it seemed virtually certain that
break between the railroads and their
employes must follow final conferen
ces.
Congressional plans include:
An 8-hour day law for railway em
ployes.
A bill to increase the membership
or tne interstate commerce commis
sion from seven to nine members with
authority to divide into groups.
A resolution stating it to be the
sense of congress, that if the railroads
grant a basic 8-hour day they should
be entitled to increased revenues
compensatory with the increased
operating expenses.
A bill already pending, directing
the interstate commerce commission
to ascertain minimum, maximum and
averago wages paid with hours of
service to.every class of railroad em
ployes, compare them with wages of
other industries in which similar skill
and risk are involved, to determine
the relation of railroad wages to rail
road revenues and urge both sides to
present dispute to defer action pend
ing the investigation.
Samuel Rea, president of the Penn
sylvania railroad, Sunday night issu
ed a statement which for the first time
since the executives decided upon tin
course they would pursue, flatly an
nounced that rather than give up ar
bitration, they regarded better to face
a strike.
He declared that for the railroads td
yield would result in a temporary but
probably not a permanent postpone
ment of the strike and that the issue
of arbitration at stake in the present
situation would be left unsettled.
Arbitration Proposed.
The railroad presidents have sub
mitted their counter proposal to the
President. This plan, holding to the
demand for arbitration which the em
ployes have declared they were unal
terably opposed, proposes:
That the question of an eight hour
day is not directly connected with the
matter at issue and that there is a dif
ference between anactualeigiit hour
day as a basis for pay.
That questions of increases of wages
are indisputably questions which
should be settled by arbitration.
That the present demands of the
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the interstate commerce commis
sion or some board to be created by
.the president or in some other way.
That if the arbitration board finds a
wage increase should be granted, .that
their finding would bo retroactive and
Hie increase will take effect from the
time the arbitration begins.
That a fund shall be created by the
railroads to provide for this contin
gency, ,tho interstate commerce com
iriission to keep the accounts that will
be necessary and the arrangement to
continue in the force for a time not
yet determined upon, the men agree
ing that during the period of arbifra
tion there shall bo no further de
mands nor any attempt to strike.

H0KINSVILLE MEN LEAD
Suspect Ulterior Motive On
Part of Great Britian
English Buyers Benefit.
Washington, Aug. 28. Confer
ences of the most vital importance to
the dark tobacco growers of Ken
tucky were begun here upon the
arrival of a group of Western Ken
tucky growers, Sunday.
With their financial status, based
upon the conditions of the market for
this year's crop, at stake, the growers
came to Washington to present the
most serious protest against the ac
tions of any of the European belliger
ents toward American producers, not
excepting the British blacklist.
Although every attempt will be
made to avoid them, there is strong
likelihood that chargqs may be made
against Great Britain that that nation
has restored the embargo on tobacco
to Germany and Austria to force down
the price, that her buyers may reap
the benefit.
The Kentucky growers who ar
rived here are prepared to submit
facts and figures of a serious nature
against England's attitude in the en
tire tobacco situation growing out of
the war, although it is their hope and
wish not to do si?.
Although the embargo on tobacco
to Germany and Austria is the princi
pal cause of their complaint, the en
tire regulations orGrear"Britain ex
tending to the importations into
England, France, Ri:s.sia and Italy
will be touched.

HIRAM KELLY INJURED
Property Was Owned by E.
R. Gilliam, Who Had No
Insurance.
After they had finished work Sat
urday night at about 10 o'clock, Hi
ram Kelly and Will Long, clerks in
the store of E. R. Gilliam, on the
Newstead Road, decided to take an
automobile trip. They went into Mr.
Gilliam's warehouse to get gasoline
for the car. They took a lanterji with
them to light the way. They set this
down in the warehouse near the gas
oline tank.
The warehouse had been a tobacco
facory. Its use for this purpose had
been long since discontinued and it
was used as a general implement
room. In it were about 19 tons of
hay, a car load of wire fencing, sev
eral plows, hay rakes and harrows
and all kinds of farm implements be
side the gasoline tank which had just
been filled.
The boys filled the tank and there
was an explosion, causing an imme
diate conflagration. They rushed
from the building calling for help.
Hiram Kelly had his arms and face
badly burned. Within three minutes
after the explosion of the gas the
whole roof and sides were in flames.
Mr. Gilliam and several men rush
ed to the scene. On one side the sta
ble with horses, hay and corn inside.
Behind the warehouse 'was his scale '
house. Neighbors who saw the flames
rushed to aid the fire fighters with
buckets filled from a cistern. Mr.
Gilliam and others drove the horses
out from the stable.
All the implements in the ware
Jiouse were burned 'and the hay and
corn in the stable was destroyed by!anu "eiore noon yesterday ttie tent

The warehouse and stable burned

side burned until Sunday afternoon
when the rain put it out. There was
no insurance on the building. The '

The great Pennyroyal Fair opens
today. The effort this year will be
to make it like it used to be in the
good old days when father and moth
er and all the family crowded into the
family buggy and went to stay all
day. The only difference will be
that the whole city of Hopkinsville
will be in the family and they will
ride out in anything they can find.
Opening day, with its noise and
happy confusion, its brass bands and
exhibits, its races and horse contests,
is upon us. This afternoon at one
thirty the gathering will be on the
corner of Ninth and Main. Automo

RUMANIA
I
ENTERS WAT
Italy Ends One of e
Anomalous Situations of
The Great War.
ITS EFFECT ON CAMPAIGN
Fighting Progressing on Every
Front But No Decision
at Any Point.
London, Aug. 28. Germany aud
Italy at last are at war. Italy has end
ed the anomalous situation that has
existed for months, declaring that
from Monday she considers herself
the enemy of her former ally. The
formal declaration amounts to little
more than official recognition of a
state of affairs whichlalrcady existed.
The declaration became inevitable
when Italy recently sent troops to
Saloniki to co-operate in the campaign
of the entente allies on the Macedo
nian front, as Germany is directing
the opposing forces and has troops on
this battle line. Italy's position in re
gard to Germany has been an anoma
lous one since Italy withdrew from
the triple alliance May 23 of last year
and declared war on Austria. Al
though by this act she arrayed her
self against her former allies, Germa
ny and Austria, she remained official
ly at peace with Germany until for
mal declaration was made.
Tjiis actitn probably will have little
effect on the military situation, al
though as the war goes on it may have
a most important bearing. On the
Austro-Italian front Italy finds activi
ty for not more than half her army
and in the future can send available
troops to any front.
Heavy lighting continues between
the entente and Teuton allies in the
Macedonian theater of the region of
Lake Ochrida, eastward of Kavala on
the Aegean, but with results becloud-
of hv rlivnrmnrr cfnfomnnlc nf Rnrltn
and Paris.
Rumania to-day entered the war by
declaring war on Germany and Aus
tria. She has 500,000 soldiers mobil
ized. HAS PROSPERED
