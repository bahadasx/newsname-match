MR. ROMNEY
RE-ELECTED TO
LEAD DEMOCRATS
Tho efforts of tho local democracy
wero frustrated on Saturday It would
seem ns Georgo Rorancy Jr., of Smith'
field, was reelected county chairman
of the Democratic party. For a long
lime, there havo been rumblings lo
cally that Mr. Romney would either
ho removed or ho would not recelvo
tho support of the local party work
ers. It seems that George was able
to muster sufficient votes to put him
over and therefore, the Democrats
who have been against him as chair
man will havo to get in and drill un
der his dictation. A vice chairman
and executive commltteo was named
as follows: Joseph E. Cardon, Wil
liam Edwards of Logan; Joseph
Walto of Hydo Park; J. J. Facer of
Hyrum; G. A. Hogan of Lowiston.
The dato of tho county convention
was not set at tho meeting held laBt
Saturday. This will bo dono later by
tho oxecutlve committee.

WILL TAXPAYERS
BE TOLD WHAT
ELECTION MEANS?
Editor Republican:
I am reminded that th? special
bond election will bo hero In a Cow
days,- and recall something concern
ing it in your paper a short tlmo .tgo.
In order that all tax payers might
know Just exactly what thoy are do
ing, I havo been looking for a state
ment from tho city oillclals, but havo
not seen It yet. Presume It will bo
forthcoming coon.
From tho reading of tho notice of
tho coming election, It appears as
though tho tax payors havo two dif
ferent questions to docldo, first, bonds
for water and second, bonds for elec
tric light, and tho tax payors may
voto for both, or vote agulnst both,
or vote for ono and against the oth
er., It seems that It is tlmo for the
tax payers to arrlvo at tho conclu
sion that they will not voto for bonds
unless thoy havo a complete and a
thorough understanding of -vlint tho
tnonoy la for and how far It will go,
According to tho statements raudo In
your paper, it would seem that tho
water bonds should bo voted without
question. Wo havo a falily good un
derstanding of tho system and Its
needs and it is up to us to install
It nnd put It In Good running o;dtr
and after it Is completed according
to tho present program, I understand
It will ho sufilclent for years and
years to como. .This being tho caso,
tho water bonds will bo a sood in
vestment and nil tax payers should
consider it a duty to voto tho water
bonds.
As to tho olcctrlo light bonds, as
far as I am concerned, I would bo
voting fop a "pig in a sacrs" and
positions west of Seres, the strongest
point of which Is at Ilarakll (2). Hulgn
rlans who crossed the Metsa on Bunda)
have reached the port of Kavala (3). On
the extreme left of the front tho Serbians
have taken some first line positions from
the Ilulgars, but have lost the town of
llanln ..-,- i ... f t.-tnrln (O Th
think beforo tax payers should be
voting ;,any more bonds for electric
light purposes or for any other pur
poso. It would be well to havo tho
entlro matter gone Into and nxplcln
cd to the peoplo. Let present con
ditions bo explained and shown up,
and estimates given about now much
It will tako to do work that la requir
ed and necessary o that tho peoplo
will know Just how much money will'
havo to bo raised and will further
Imow Just what they will havo alter
tho money has been raised and
Kpent. Tho present administration
Is a business administration end it
seems to me It would bo right for
them to let tho peoplo know what
kind of an operation Is necessary,
and how much tho entlro operation
will cost, and In what condition tho
city will be In after the operation hos
beon performed and paid for.
Now, Mr. Editor, I think it you
havo anything further you should
give it to tho peoplo in order that
they might know how to couduct
themselves on election day and If I
have said anything that is not light
will you pleaso correct me.
Yours truly, TAX PAYER.
