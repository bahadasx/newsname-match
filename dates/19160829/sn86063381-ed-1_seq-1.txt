hood committees had made an order
but no one outside of the councils
had suspected that a date had been
set
Strike is Nearer.
Although the strike is nearer to
day than it has ever been, President
"Wilson is still hopeful of averting the
strike.
If the strike set for Monday is con
summated, Wilson plans on military
operation ot railways with the pres

the president plans the Canadian dis
putes act for the settling of the
strike, it must be passed before Mon
day when they will go ahead with the
plans for striking
Order is B^~*
The brotherhood strike order is
brief It is addressed to all members
of the four brotherhoods, is signed by
the various general chairmen and
reads as follows:
"Sirs and brothers: This is to ad
vise that the vote of the employes in
train and egme service on the 8 hour
day and time and one-half overtime
proposition was overwhelmingly in
favor of a strike.
"Notwithstanding this your repre
sentatives have been unable to effect
a satisfactory settlement, and a strike
under the laws of the respective or
ganizations becomes effective on
September 4, 1916, at a. m.
"Impart this information to those
interested so they will understand
that they are to promptly obey
On a separate sheet the duty of
members and officers in the conduct
of a strike are set forth. Particular
emphasis is placed on conducting the
'proposed strike as peacefully as pos
sible Among the duties set forth
are the:
Duties Explained.
"No man in road service involved
in the srike will perform any service
after the hour set to strike unless he
has already begun a trip and has ac
tually left the terminal If the train
has left the terminal he will complete
the trip and deliver the engine and
train at the end of the run, or tie up
point, if tied up under the law, after
which he will perform no further ser
vice until the close of the strike Men
in other than road service will leave
the service at the appointed time
So far as your legal right to strike
is concerned, there is no difference
between a mail train and a freight
train You have identically the same
Tight to refuse to perform service in
a mail train as you have to refuse to
perform service on a freight train
"All men on strike will keep away
from the company property except
such men as designated certain duties
to perform by authorities of the or
ganization

the laws of the land must be obeyed
