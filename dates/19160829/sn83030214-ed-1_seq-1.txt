between Greece and the Allied Powers
and dispel ary misunderstanding which

SAYS RUMANIA'S WAR DECLARATION
I.ondon, Aup. 'JS. The Rumanian declaration of war. as

sets forth her grterancer..
fhe persemtinn of Rumanians by Austro Hungarian offi?
cials is alleged, and it is charged that agreem.-nts uliich existed
between Rumania and the former members of the Triple Alliance
bave been broken in letter and spirit from the time (rermany and
Austria entered on the war.
Itah. thr declaration says. was oUiged to detaeli berself
from \nstria and (iermany. The motives in compellinc Ru

I'ir.st. The Rumanian population in \usfrian terri

Second. Rumania beliors that by intenrening -1'

Third. Rumania plaee* herself on the -?.id'" of Ihos.

Rumanian Army Battles
For Transylvania Passes
Bulgars Prepare to Resist Invasion from Russians,
While German Reserves on the Danube
Are Called Into Action.
London. Aug. 28. -The Rumanian*. i
'have begun the drive into Hungary.!
\ ioanfl reports to-night "treacherous
I attacks" Ifl the southeastern and east- '
1 ai*B mountain passes. Apparently King
l-'erdinand's commanders intend to in
trench themselves tirmly in the coveted
province of Transylvania.
The battle in progress has foi itfl
prize the passes flf the Transylvania
Up . guarding the approaches to the
i Hungarian plain from the south. The
1 opposing forces are in contact at
r.othrnthunn Pass, fifteen miles south
of Hermaniistadt, former eapital of
Hungary, and at pas3e- south of Kron
stadt. one of the most important cities
'. of the province and only six miles from
the Rumanian frontier.
What preparations Bulgaria has made
to offset a Rumanian in\a.-.ion and a
an drive through Dobrudja are
BOl known here. lt seems a toregone
conclusion that Bulgaria and Rumania
soon will be at war. Then the way
will be open for an attack against the
Bulgarian army from the north.

People, Aroused to Action by EntraflCC of

By ARTHIR S. DRAPER.
(By Cable to The Tribune)
London, Aug. 28.?Rumania is at war v. ith Grrmair ind
Austria.
Bucharest declared war on Austria last night. I.ess than
twelve hours later Berlin declared war on Rumania. Turkey
and Bulgaria are expected to follow Germany's lead without
delay.
A Rumanian army has crossed already into Transylvaniii
and is engaged in battle with the Austrians in the mountain
passes on the southeastem frontier of Hungary.
On the Pruth and the Danube a large Russian force is -on
centrated, ready to move down the Danube and march throunh
Rumania into Bulgaria. Thus a Russian sledge soon will he
battering the Bulgarian against Sarrail's anvil.
Greek Intervention Expected Soon.
To the Allied forces have been added an army of at lease
iJUO.000 men and the way is open for a body blow at Bulgina.
and an invasion of Hungary from the east. Greece undoubtedly
will be influenced by Rumania's decision. and some observers
here predict her entry into the war within a fortnight.
The situation in Greece is developing rapidly. Venizelos
hourly is regaining his power and incidents are crowding ont
another so closely that a change in the whole situation is lik-ly
over night.
