Berlin, Aug. 29. A great battle may
oc.ur along the Rumanian frontier
within a few hours.
Rumania has beeu concentrating large
forces along the Transylvania border for
several dnys, the Tageblatt reported to
day. The Teutonic forces took prompt
measures to guard against a sudden in
vasion and have massed sufficient
troops to meet the Rumanian attack.
The patrol skirmishes reported in yes
terday's official war office statement
may mark the beginning of an impor
tant engagement.
The Berlin newspapers commented
with grent restraint upon Rumania's
entrance into the war. The general
opinion of German critics is that Ru
mania will play no important part in
military affairs except that it will be
necessary to regroup the forces of the
central powers to some extent to meet
the new enemy. The I.okal Anzeiger
points out that the Rumania declara
tion does not affect the food situation
because Rumania has exported little
food to Germany and Austria lately.
Chancellor Von Bcthmnnn-Hollweg
.held a lengthy conference today with
the leading ministers, including Dr.
Helfferich, vice-chancellor and Acting
Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Ticutler Branteestratur.
The Loknl Anzeiger announced today
that Field Marshal Mackensen is in
command of the Teutonic armies in the
Balkans.
"The people of the extended entente
will find us ready to meet the new sit
uation created by Rumania's entrance
into the war," said the Lokal "Anzeig
er. "Next to Hiiidenburg on the east
front, Mackensen will now begin a new
bloody work in the Balkans. Now his
time has come to reap the harvest of
long montus or quiet preparation.
Oispatehes from Kronstadt, Transyl
vania, six miles from the Rumanian
frontier, report that since Sunday an
unbroken stream of German and Aus-
trimi refugees have been crossing the

BIG FIRE RAGING IN '
FOREST RESERVE
Blaze Starts from Careless
Campers in Snoqualmie
Forest Reserve
Tacoma, Wash., Aug. 2!). Fifty ad
ditional fire fighters were sent out to
day to aid the men already combatting
the forest fires reported raging in the
Snoqunlmie forest reserve near the
summit of the Cascades. The fire is
burning along the White Chuck river
and 1500 acres of timber already have
been burned over. The loss is estimat
ed at several thousand dollars. The
Northern Pacific railroad station at
Lester was saved with difficulty by
employes of the company who stretched
long lines of hose from locomotives
with which to fight the flames.
Small fires reported from various
parts of Pierce county last week, are
now under control.
Carelessness on the part of motorist9
and campers is assigned by state fire
warden F. E. Pnpe as the cause of the
greater number of the fires started in
the reserve.

With Mrs. Hughes Takes
Some Hard Climbs in
Colorado's Big Park
By Perry Arnold
(United Press staff correspondent)
; Estes Park, Colo., Aug. 29. The lure
of the mountain trails caught Charles
E. Hughes today. With Mrs. Hughes
by his Bide in a gown of creamy linger
ie and white pumps, he essayed a pre
cipitous cliff which juts downward
from tlMvi'allB river highway in Colon
ial Park to view Chasm Falls.' The
stiff climb down the rock strewn gorge
was entirely impromptu, as Mrs,
Hughes explained, ruefully pointing to
her dainty pumps.
"I do not usually do mountain
climbing in these shoes," she said as
she caught her husband's hand and
was helped from one great boulder to
another.
Mr. and Mrs. Hughes spent the day
motoring, playing golf and in strolling
about the lesser nills in the vicinity of
Estes Park. In the long ride up the
magnificent roadway which rises a
sheer 2000 feet within four miles, Mr.
Hughes discovered some "teeth" in1
Meeker's Point, the mountain shield-i
ing the continental divide, that al
most tempted him to start climbing
despite his modish sack suit and new
russet shoes. He restrained himself,
however, until Chnsm Falls was reach
ed, when his penchant for overcoming
obstacles overcame him.
The guests of the Stanley hotel are
already getting accustomed to seeing
Mr. Hughes lounging easily in a big
rocking chair, on the veranda, discuss
ing altitudes and mountain climbing
with other, enthusiasts.
He mislaid his hut today and there
was hurried search for it before he
could go out and discuss general, but
not "political'' conditions, with Wil
liam Allen White, who live here dur
ing the summer. -

Effect of Message
On Pending Strike
Washington, Aug. 29. The
railroad brotherhood leaders in
dicated this afternoon after the
president's speech that it had
no way altered their determina
tion to strike Monday unless a
satisfactory agreement is
reached with the managers.
The thirteen general chair
men of the railway brotherhood
remaining here to deal with the
strike situation will leave for
home immediately, it was an
nounced late this afternoon.
Only the four brotherhood pres
idents will stay in the city and
they plan to direct the strike
from here.
Railway presidents took the
oposite view.
"The strike is off for the
present," some of them said.
'The brotherhood men will not
dare call a strike while congress
is threshing the matter out."
That the legislative program
outlined by the president could
be put through congress in two
days, possibly is one, provided
the joint interstate commerce
committee can get together im
mediately without serious dif
ferences," is the belief of House .
Leader Kitchin.
.
Washington, Aug. 29. The presi
dent's speech to congress on the rail
road strike issue follows:
"Gentlemen of the Congress:
"I have come to you to seek your
assistance in dealing with a very grave
situation, which has arisen out of the
demand of the employes of the railroads
engaged in freight train service that
they be granted an eight hour working
day, safeguarded-by payment for an
hour and a half of service for every
hour of work beyond the eight.
"The matter has been agitated for
more than a year. The public has been
made familiar with the demands of the
men and the arguments urged in favor
! of them and even more familiar with
the objections of the railroads and their
counter demand that certain privileges
now enjoyed by their men and certain
basis of "payment worked out through
many years of contest be reconsidered,
lock between the parties.
Law is Inadequate.
"The means provided by law for the
rueOia'.ion of he controversy failed and
th.) means of arbitration for which the
ht provides were rejected. The rep
resentatives of the railway executives
pn posed that the demands of the men
be submitted in their entirety to arbitra
tion r.long with certain questions of re
adjustment as to pay and conditions of
employment which seemed to them to
be cither closely associated with the
demands or to call for reconsideration
on their own merits; the men absolutely
1 declined arbitration, especially if any
j of their established privileges were
by that means to be drawn again in
question. The law in the matter put
no compulsion upon them. The four
ltmla.l thnnennrl man frnm tvhnm thA
,iemauj8 proceeded had voted to strike
tlirniiahnnt the United States must
' stand still ufitil their places are filled
if, indeed, it should prove possible to
fill them at all. Cities will be cut off
from their food supplies, the whole
commerce of the nation will be para
lvzed, men of every sort and occupa
tion will be thrown out of employment.
"i countless thousands will in all likelihood
be brought, it may be, to the very
point of starvation, and a tragical na
tional calamity brought on, to be added
to the other distresses of the time, be
cause no basis of accommodation or set
tlement has been found.

Indian Sold Mine Took Family
for Ride in Hearse to

Maysville, Cal., Aug. 29. Jim Tobin
is just an untutored Indian, but he cer
taiuly knows how to entertain his fam
ily when his days are flush. The best
is none too good for him.
So when he . soldi a mine on Slate

style. Taxicabs had no appeal for Jim
when he brought his squaw and pap
pooses hero but he saw a discarded
hearse in the rear of a livery stable
and immediately purchased it. Next he
bought a watermelon apiece for the
squaw and each of her six children,
placed the whole family in the glass
enclosed dead wagon and proudly jog
ged up and down Main street display
ing to the wondering world his idea of
"class" in, celebrations. A trail of
watermelon seeds and rinds marked the
hearse's path.
When last seen, Jim was joy riding
his hearse over the sixty mile trail to
wards home, the proudest Indian in
California.
$ Late War Bulletins
Salonika, Aug. 29. Cheers went up
all along the 140 mile front of the al
lies in the Balkans when news of
Rumania's declaration of war was
flashed to the battle front from
Salonika.
Tho first word was received here
early yesterday. Bulletins were dis
played in the troop camps and the
news was rushed on to the front.
Thousands of small slips of paper,
carrying word of Rumania's action,
were hastily printed and carried to the
front by Anglo-French aviators to be
showered behind the Bulgarian lines.
Rumor of Resignations.
The Hague, Aug. 29. A report was
circulated in diplomatic circles here to

man have tendered their resignations
to the German chancellor as the result

that the resignations have been ac

Fighting Has Begun.
Berlin, Aug. 29. Fighting between
Teutonic forces and Russo-Rumauia

The wording of the German official

reports of serious occurrences in Sofia

PROPOSED PLANS
OF LEGISLATION
Must Get Laws In Operation
Before Monday Says
One Leader
NO ONE HAS AUTHORITY
TO WITHDRAW ORDER
Brotherhood Will Submit De
cision Today Rejecting
Railroad Proposal
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Tress staff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 29. If President
Wilson plans to halt threatening rail
road strike through a law simijur to the
Canadian disputes act, he must get it
passed beforo Monday, Otherwise the
brotherhood leaders will go ahead with
their plans for walking out Labor
day.
This intimation came very broadly
from the brotherhood camp today and
the intimation is supported by the nu
ture of the Canadian law. The law
rrcvents a lockout or a strike being
started during a given period. Hence,
if the strike is already in effect Mon
day, the law will be inoperative in the
view of brotherhood leaders.
To Reject Proposals.
Washington, Aug. 29. Tho four
brotherhood chiefs and tho 24 members
of the executive committee today
agreed to reject the proposal of the rail
road presidents as made to President
Wilson yesterday. No formal announce
ment was made, but it is known this
actbn wf) taken". "
"We-will submit our decision to the
president leday." said President Lee.
of tho Brotherhood of Trainmen.
Tim . morning meeting heard the re
port of tho lour leaders on their con
ference with the president Inst night,
at which they told him their final pur
pose, though they did not report specif
ically on the railway presidents' pro
posals. Cannot Change Order.
The brotherhood heads explained to
day they have no authority to rescind
the strike for September 4. The resolu
tion, adopted Sunday, before the U40
representatives left for home, they said,
gave them authority to fix the date and
hour of the strike "unless prior to the
day and hour so fixed, notice shall have
been received that the proposal of the
pre?idei't of the United' States, accepted
by us August 18, has been accepted by
th! lniliond companies."
It ii understood that the executive
ciinmittee of 24, to whom full powers
were aelegateu by the (40, could grant
such authority to the four leaders, but
that it has thus far withheld it.
Brotherhood leaders feel that Presi
deat Wilson's proposal for eight hour
day laws will be a greater burden to
the railroads than to the men. Under
it, a vast number of non-union men
would automatically become eight hour
men and while the brotherhood, men
would get only eight hours an no in
crease in pay they believe the
economic pressure caused by such a svs
tem would weigh more heavily on the
railroads than granting tho president's
demands.
"Misery loves company," said a
prominent lender. "The railroads'
reason for refusing the men's demands
is purely economic; our reasons contnin
humanitarian elements, so if the rail
roads must include in the eight hour
day the men whom they call the down
trodden eighty per cent, they will be
suffering 20 times to our one."
Great Throttle in Labor.
President Wilson's other proposal
creating a law similar to the Canadian
disputes act is generally opposed by the
brotherhoods. They call it "the great
est throttle on labor" ever devised.
"While the law provides that no ac
tion shall be taken by cither side, pend
ing investigation," said a leader, "ex-
i perience in Canada hows that capital
always has taken advantage of the in
vestigation period to prepare for a
strike. The Canadian act is named for
Lemieux. We have been 'Lcmieux' too
mnn times "
Whether the brotherhoods will fight
the law provided it is passed before in
auguration of a strike is conjectural.
"I cannot discuss the law, for it is a
question when uch a law would be
operative," said A. B. Garretson,
spokesman for the brotherhoods.
"I don't know whether it would be
effective."
"What would happen if the law were
passed about Monday noon after a
strike was started" the leader was
asked.
"Well I should say tho men would
have plenty of leisure time to consider
it."

IN LABOR DISPUTE
President Appears Before
Congress and Asks for
Legislation
"TO SAFEGUARD LIFE AND
INTEREST OF NATION"
Pionts Out Things Necessary
to Prevent Disaster Now
and in Future
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staft correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 29. As a dramatis
climax to his unprecedented negotia
tions to avert the most disastrous lajjor
war that ever threatened the United
States, President Wilson this afternoon
appeared before a joint session of con
gress and urged legislation "to safe
guard tho life and intorest of the na
tion." Ho said he urged the legislation "not
in haste or merely as a means of meet
ing a present emergency, but as per
manent mid necessary additions to the
law, suggested, indeed, by circumstances
we had hoped never to see, but impera
tive as well as just, if such emergencies
are to be prevented in the future."
He recommended:
Immediate provision for the enlarge
ment and administrative reorganization
of the interstate commerce commission,
enabling the committee to deal with
tho duties now devolving upon it "with
a promptness and thoroughness whieh.
are with its prosent constitution and
means of ' action practically impoa

as the legal basis ali'.te of work and of
wages in the employment of all railroad
employes engaged in operating trains in
interstate transportation. ' The time fer
the institution of thl law is to be de
termined by congress. The president
suggested no date.
Wants Full Investigation.
Authorization of the appointment by
the president of a commission to study
results in the application of the eleht
hour dny to railroad operation, alike
for the men and for the roads; the In
vestigators to report to congress at the
earliest possible date but without recom
mendation as to legislative action.
Approval by congress of consideration
bv the interstate commerce commission
of freight rate increases to meet such
additional expenditures by the roads an
are rendered necessary by adoption of
the eight hour day.
Amendment of the federal law which
provides for the mediation, conciliation,
and arbitration of such controversies as
the present by adding a provision that
in caso methods of accommodation now
provided should fail, a full public inves

Officials lis circumstances require.
Told of HU Efforts.
The president outliucd in detail his)
efforts to effect a settlement of the
nendinir dispute through friendly nego
tiations. His efforts, he said, had "re
sulted in complete deadlock."
Now the country faces, he said, a
great nntionul calamity with "cities cut
off from food supplies and the com
merce of the nation paralyzed. Count
less thousands will in all likelihood be
brought, it may be, to be the very point
of starvation."
Mediation under the existing laws
has failed, he admitted aud arbitration
hus been rendcrod impossible "by the
ottitude o'f tho men."
He said that he had offered the eight
hour day as a basis for agreement be
cause the "whole spirit of the time and
the prepondcrcnt evidence of recent
economic experience" spoke out for it.

railroads would "ultimately be obliged
