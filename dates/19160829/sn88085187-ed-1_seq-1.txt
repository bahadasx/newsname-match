Why Not
Vote For
Our Jim?
BY THE EDITOR
One of my callers yesterday was a blocky individ
ual who glories in tlie name of Jim.
A mutual friend of ours brought Jim in. He
wanted us to meet. I was glad of tlie opportunity
because, while I have written several editorial re
garding Jim, I never had talked with him.
I found, after a half hour's conversation, that I
liked Jim better than I thought I should.
/ learned also that I had been doing him an un
intentional wong by blaming him in my own mind
and once in an editorial reference for harsh treat
ment of employes.
You see. it is this way: Jim's last name is Mc-
Keel y. He is a shingle anil lumber manufacturer.
And a lot of us (lie tells me he finds them all over
the state) have confuted him with I_. J. .McXeelev,
who also is a Pierce county lumberman. They are
related neither by blood nor in a business way.
Well. K. J. isn't running for office, so let him
pass. But it happens that Jim is; he wants to be
governor. Consequently the public is much inter
ested in his labor record.
As lie told it to me, and as I gathered it from oth
er sources, Jim has been a fair-dealing sort of a
boss, ln 20 years he has never had to defend a
personal injury suit. He has paid always the going
scale of wages and often better. He never hired
Japs or Chinese. He never has deducted hospital
or doctor's fees from wages. On the other hand, he
has paid hundreds of dollars out for Mich purjKises
himself, has paid in full the wages of injured men
during the lime they were off and has educated doz
ens of children not his own. ,
Jim has all the ear marks of a shr^od, capable,
ambitions, square-shooting business man. lie if g
card index sort of a fellow. He believes in effic
iency and appears to know how to attain it.
Politically, 1 suspect. Jim is considerable of a
standpatter. In fact, J do not recall that he denied
that impeachment.
Well. I told Jim, as I have told all The Times
readers, that this paper's first choice for governor
is Henry Mcßrtde. I believe he possesses Jim's ef
ficiency, honesty and business sense, and that at the
same time he is a more progressive thinker.
However, here is something that every voter must
remember. If he wants his first choice to be counted
he MUST VOTE ALSO FOR A SECOND
CHOICE.
I have studied the records of the eight republican
candidates rather closely, and Jim does not suffer by
comparison with the others, excepting Mcßride.
So why shouldn't Tacomans give him that second
choice vote? It might not nominate him, but it
would be giving a man who has worked his way
from millhand to a high position in the community
a fitting recognition. And then again (you never
ran tell about elections) it might nominate him. And
Tacoma ought not to object to supplying the candi
dates for both big parties, ought it?
If for any reason you don't want to vote for Jim
for either first or second choice, how about John G.
Lewis, of Aberdeen, the only other Southwest Wash
ington candidate? Lewis is clean and capable, too.
Either he or Jim would be far preferable to Sutton,
Lee, Hartley or the others.
Let it not be said that our Soullncest Washington
potentialities are not without honor save in their own
district, to paraphrase and further ''ntangle a good
old political paragraph.
Vote for Jim (or John) for second choice.

MABEL ABBOTT FINDS
THE LONELIEST MAN
By Mabel Abbott
I have found the loneliest
man 1"» the world.
I made Ihe discovery al
Athletic park Friday.
Knowing littTe and caring less
about the rules of baseball, I am
free to enjoy the game as a spec
tacle.
I don't care whether the run
ners make their bases or not, but
I delight ln their grotesque grace
as they run.
I am not interested In whether
the pitcher throws a curved ball,
but I love to watch him tie him
self into a knot before he does it.
Thinga that are stereotyped
commonplaces to those who sit
regularly every day In the grand
.stand and know all about the
.game, are strange and full of in
terest to me.
So, on Friday, it was not the de
cisions of the umpire that caught
and held my attention, but his
peculiar Isolation.
Not One of Them
Standing now behind the pitch
er, now behind the catcher, run
ning catlike for the base where
a player and the ball were due to
arrive almost simultaneously, he
was always AMONG the men. but
never for an instant OF them.
Nobody paid any attention to
him if the declalon waa to the
crowd's satisfaction. But If not —
I watched him when a point
for the home team demanded his
gesture. He did not make the
gesture.
"Out!" he bawled, ln a voice
like a megaphone; and the storm
broke. Hoarse growls from the
field were drowned by roars from
tim grandstand.
"Aw, you rotten piece of
ihrcacl
"Where'd you get that
stuff!" "
"Hey, unips, go an' learn
the game!"
Lonely and apparently Indif
ferent, the black figure walked
back to Its place behind the
pitcher.
Presently the game waa over,
and we went out, happy and noisy
because Tacoma had won. Every
body- was talking of Hartman, or
Williams.
One Ix»Be Figure
Friends waited to welcome the
players and walk proudly away

Wilson Precedent
By F. M. Kerby
WASHINGTON, l> ('., Aug. 29.
j—President Wilson and congress
* have ample precedent fpr Mtling
and operating the railroads of
the United States, if they are
forced into sucb a position.
Once before Ihe iihGoiihl
government took over und
• •pi-mini privately owned
lalliuails, on the eve of the
greatest crisis America ever
laced—the t'lvll war!
On March 11, 1861. in antici
pation of the outbreak of civil
war, the national government
took possession of the Phila
delphia, Wilmington & Baltimore
railroad.
Without Congress.
This was done without action
of congress, hut when congress
assembled In 1862, on Jan. 11, It
confirmed the action taken by
passing an act declaring:
"That the president, when in
his judgment the public safety
may require it, be and he ls here
by authorized to take possession
of any and all the telegraph Hues
of the United States, of any and
all railroad lines, their roiling
stock, offices, shops, inillil.ii *n.
etc., to prescribe rules and regu
lations for the holding, using and
maintaining of the aforesaid tele
graph and railroad lines, and to
extend, repair and complete the
same; to place under military
control all the officers, agents
and employes belonging to the
telegraph and railroad lines, thus
taken possession by the presi
dent, so that they shall be con
sidered as a post road and a part I
of t In- military establishment of
tho United States, subject to all
restrictions Imposed by the rules
and articles of war."
Section two of the bill pro
vided for PUNISHMENT BY
in: \'l ll or such other pen
alty as court-martial might
impose, of all persons who
resisted or Interfered with
tlie unrestricted use by the
government of this railroad
and telegraph property.
Another section provided for
commissioners to assess and de
termine damages suffered or the
compensation to which any rail
road or telegraph company might
be entitled as the result of Its
seizure by the government.
A Military Director.
Under this act, on Feb. 11,
1862, President Lincoln appoint
ed D ('. McCallum as "military
director and superintendent of
railroads" takep under control by
order of Edwin M. Stanton, secre
tary of war.
On the 26th of May, 1862, Her
man Haupi, a railway engineer of
distinguished ability, was ap
pointed "chief of construction
and transportation" in the de

with the rank of colonel.

"I Intend to go through

me to draft Into Ihe federal

Garretson denied that Wilson
made such n statement. lie alio
denied the report that Wilson
criticized tlie lirotlierhoods for
stating that the date for th*
strike would he Sept. 4 while ne
gotiations were still In progress.
It was learned the four broth

tlie trainmen's executive commit
ted agreed to reject the railway
presidents' counter-proposal.
President Las of the trainmen'e
brotherhood said:
"We will submit our decision
to Wilson today."
Four leaders reported this
morning on the conference with
the president last night. They did
not report specifically on the
railway presidents' counter pro

One prominent president said:
"There Is going to be a strike.
That is certain. Let's have it. it

Brotherhood leaders said that
If President Wilson plana to halt
the strike by a law similar to the
Canadian disputes act, congress
must act before Monday.
Otherwise, the brotherhoods
intend to walk out on Labor
day.
Leaders declared the law would
be Ineffective if the strike should
begin before Wilson signed the
measure.
President Wilson completed his
