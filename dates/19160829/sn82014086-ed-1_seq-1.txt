MOTHER MISTAKEN FOR
BURGLAR BY DAUGHTER
Mrs. Mary Butler, Shot in Fleshy Part
of Right Shoulder.
Revere, Mass., Aug. 23. Mrs. Mary
Butler, 61 years old, was mistaken for
a burglar by her daughter, Mrs. H.
L. McKinlcy, early today, and shot.
The wound, which is in the fleshy part
of the right shoulder, is serious on'y
because of Mrs. "Butler's age. To the
police, Mrs. McICinley explained that
she heard someone moving about the
house and, fearing it was nn intruder,
took ft revolver to investigate. She
cried "Help, burglars" from a ivirdow,
which aroused her mother who went
down stairs to Investigate. When she
was returning, Mrs. McKinley met her
on the stairway and, not recognizing
her in the darkness, fired. Search of
the house by ofkers developed no
trace of an Intruder.

the capture of heights south of Zbros
ko by the Bulgarians and the repulse
of Serbian counter-attacks on Mount
Seganska. while Paris says the Serbs
hsve made considerable progress near
Vetrenika and repulsed with heavy
losses Bulgarian attacks on the road
from Banica to Ostrovo. Paris admits
however, the occupation by the Bul
garians of positions abandoned by the
Greeks west of Kavala, on the Aegean
sea.
Artillery engagements and mine op
erations have again characterized the
fighting on the western front in Prance
and Belgium. The French official
communication reports further prog
rers for the French troops east of Del
ville wood and near the Mouquete farm
in the Somme region, while London re
ports the shelling of the British posi
tions by the Germans, especially be
tween Pozieres and the Thiepval wood
and reciprocal bombardments at other
points. A German attack near Fleury
tailed.
From the Riga region in Russia to
the Carpathian passes there have been
isolated engagements at various points
between the Russians and the Austro
Germans, but no notable successes by
either side. Hard fighting is in prog
ress between the Russians and the
Turks in the Lake Van region and
north of Bitlis. In the latter region
the Turks have been driven back
southward by a Russian counter-attack
with loss of men and guns.
Aside from bombardments bv the
Austrian of Italian positions along the
isonzo front, the situation in the Aus.
tro-Italian theatre remains unchanged.

PERSECUTION OF RUMANIANS
BY AUSTRO-HUNGARIANS
Is Alleged by Rumania to be Cause
of Declaration of War.
Paris, Aug. 28, 4 p. m. La Liberte
has received from Geneva a summary
of the Rumanian declaration o f war,
as elegraphed from Vienna. It is a
long document, in which Rumania sets
forth her grievances. The persecu
tion of Rumanians by Austro-Hungar-ian
officials, is alleged, and it is charg
ed that agreements which existed be
tween Rumania and the former mem
bers of the triple alliano have been
broken in letter and spirit from the
time Germany and Austria entered in
the war.
Italy, the declaration says, was
obliged to detach herself trom Aus
tria and Germany. In conclusion, the
communication sets forth as follows
the motives in compelling Rumania to
enter the war:
First, the Rumanian population in
Austria territory Is exposed to the
hazards of war and of invasion.
Second, Rumania believes that by
intervening she can shorten the world
war.
Third. Rumajiia places herself on
the side of those powers which she
believes can assist h?r most efficacious"
ly in realizing her national ideal.

AN
EXTREME FALL IN PRICE OF
11 3-8 CENTS.
CLOSED AT LOWEST
Big Drop Caused by Fear That Ru
mania's Entry Into War Will Mean
Marketing of Vast Stores of Grains
Held by the Russians.
Chicago, Aug. 28. Abrupt widening
of the European war zone today sent
wheat values tumbling almost as if
the market had no bottom. The ex
treme fall in prices was 11 1-8 cents,
an amount virtually parallel to the ex
traordinary rise witnessed two years
ago on the day that hostilities began.
Transactions today, as then, were on a
large scale, measured in millions of
bushels.
Russian Grain May be Marketed.
It wa,s the view that the end of the
war had perhaps been greatly hastened
which in the main brought about to
day s big drop in quotations. Even
the most conservative traders serious
ly discussed the chance that at least
by a speedy opening of the Dardanelles
vast stores of Russian grain soon
would reach western Surope as a re
sult of Rumania having at last joined
fortunes with tho Anglo-French al
lies. Contrary assertions that the im
mediate consequence of extension of
military operations would mean in
creased ruin of food supblies failed to
result in more than transient partial
recoveries in quotations.
Closed at Lowest of Day.
Rumania's declaration of war was
generally coupled with the prospect
that Italy was about to participate ac
tively with the new recruit in a fresh
effort to force the Dardanelles. Word
late today in the session that actual
fighting had begun on the Rumanian
frontier set the wheat pit here nearly
frantic and was followed by a wild
close at the lowest prices of the day,
lt'jy, to 1404 for September and
against HO'i to 140 for September
143 to l-H-ls for December as
agairst Saturday's finish of respective
ly 15d to 154.
Throughout the day and especially
during the late dealing the increased
chances of a general strike in the
L'nited States added to the excitement
of wheat traders and formed a nercep
tible factor in bringing about the col
lapse of the market.
