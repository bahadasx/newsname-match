Washington, August 2!t. Presi

peace between the railroads and the
brotherhoods are. expected to end to
day. Having exhausted every means of
bringing the two parties together on
common ground to prevent a nation

to i eek through legislation what appa

Railroad Heads Defiant.
The danger of a gencial suikc be.
came more acute again today. The
brotherhoods, at their conference with
President Wilson at the White House
last night, refused to agree to the
president's urgent request to recall
the f trike order w hich has been issued
for a walkout of 400,000 trainmen at
7 a. m. on labor day. Railroad execu

Beautiful Service to Be Conducted by the
Order of the Eastern Star at
Cemetery
Thursday will' witness both a beau
tiful and impressive ceremony to be
conducted by the members of the Or
der of the Eastern Star at the Odd fel
lows cemetery, and the annual picnic
of the order which will follow at Slum
oan Springs for Masons and their fam
ilies. The central feature of the cere
mony will be the unveiling of a hand
some monument dedicated by the Or
der of the Eastern Star to the various
Masonic fraternities in Chickasha and
which marks the. burial ground of des-
titute Masons who die in this
city.
The service will begin at the cemetery
at 7 o'clock.
The monument itself is a striking
product of the craftsman's skill and
is one of the neatest that has ever been
seen in this part of the country... Con
ceived by William Frasier, an enthu
siastic Mason of Chickasha, the idea
was developed by various members of
the Order of the Eastern Star, and es
pecially by Mrs. S. K Nebergall, Mrs.
Perry Dawson and C. 0, Courcier,
members of the committee, until it as
sumed form which does credit both
to the designers and- to C. E. Barney,
in whose yard the work wat executed.
The memorial is a fac simile of the
Masonic altar and into its surfaces are
cut the various emblems of the five
branches of the order which are ,p
resented by the fraternity in Chicka-
sha.
Surmounting the altar is the Bi-
ble and square and compasses as may
be seen in any lodge room.

loped design oeiwcen uie nve nouns

ihe four sides of the column are
emblazoned with emblems of the East
ern Star and of local Masonic lodges.
To the east is that of the Eastern Star
with the date of the dedication of tii
memorial, which is also the anniversary
of the birth of its founder, Itobert Mor
ris. On the west is the emblem of the
blue lodge, A. F. & A. M.; to the north
is shown the emblems of the Royal
Arch degree and the Cryptic Masons,
and to the south that of the Knight
Templar, showing the live branches
to which the monument is dedicated.
The body of the alter proper is sixteen
inches quare and it measures thirty

playing Oklahoma City at the latter
place. The first home game will be
with Enid on October (i. This prom
ises to be one of the heaviest games.
If not the heaviest, of the entire sea
son, Tho open dates at present ara
Oct. 27 and Nov. ". Eauton will prob
ably play here on 1he latter date. At

PERSONAL
TAX PAST
DUE NOW
i
County Treasurer Muilican today is
sued the following statement:
In tljis issue of the Express you will
find a list of those who according to
the tax rolls have not paid their per
sonal taxes for the year J 9 1 5 .
I regret very much to have to pub
lish the names of those who are delin
quent but the law compels me to force
collections by such advertising and the
i
issuing of warrants to the sheriff, twen
ty days thereafter.
It has been over thirty days since
I notified each person who was delin
quent that within a few days I wouM
publish the list and I feel that I have
done more than is required and have
given ample time for them to make,
the payments and shall now proceed
to comply with the law. There has
not been very much extra cost added
yet but if the taxes are not paid at
once the sheriff will do the collecting
and the cost wjll then greatly increase.
Real estate upon which taxes for:1""""1 '
i;ur, have not been pad will be adver- j
tised the first of October and the land
or lots sold the first of November.
This year's fl'MOi taxes will be due
November 1st and will be delinquent
January 1st, PUT.
Hoping that you will appreciate my
i position in the matter above reterrea
to and that you will remember I am
merely your agent or servant in hand

offices I Bin,
Yours very truly,

Business Side of Athletics,
it may bo mentioned here that every
attention is given to the business side
of athletics at the high school. The
expenses of the schedule are figured
closely, and no gamo is contracted for
until the financial side has been care
fully considered. The entire expense
of the schedule for this season is
known in advance, and with good
weather conditions and hearty support
of the townspeople, tho Beason should
be a. money-maker. Tho support last
season was tho best possible, With
that kind of support In the future tho
soliciting of funds from tho business
men to start tho season will continue
to bo a thing of the past.
Athletic Board In Charge.
The scheduling of games, finnncinr;
of the Beason, etc., are in charge of
an uthletic board in tho school. This
board is made up of the principal, the
coaches, the student managers auj
team captains and a faculty treasurer.
Books are carefully kept and the exact
financial condition always known. Nj
money can be expended without the
vote of this board, and all receipts
must be reported to it, at the frequent
meetings. It Is entirely due lo the
care and attention of this board that
tho season of last, year was such a
financial success.
Flattering Prospects. (
The general verdict is that prospects
for the local term are good to put
tho statement; very conservatively, and
that is the way Coach Reeds prefers
to put it at' this stage. The boys are
extremely anxious for tho season to
begin and will be out in force when
the coach issues his call to arms
about Sept. 12.
