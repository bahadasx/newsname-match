Rumania and Italy Praised
by Entente for Decla
ration of War.
BERLIN NOT ALARMED
Feeling in Germany Is That
One Foe More or Less
Makes No Difference.
London. Ane. 2!, (:2:4" p. m.1
Desperate lighting on the border
between K u mania and Hungary is
reported in an Exchange Tele
graph dispatch from Berne, Switz
erland. The Rumanian, the mes
sage says, are making furious ef
forts to capture the important
mountain jr.isses.
Paris, Aue. 2. 6:01 a. m.) The
Bucharest correspondent of the
Petit Journal wires that he is in
formed that Bulgaria has decided
not to declare war on Rumania,
fTen though that country permits
the passage through it of Kussian
troops.
The invasion of Hungary by
Russians and Rumanians is not
only possible, says Lieutenant Col
onel IlousetU the military critic
of La Liberte, but it is imminent.
President Toincare has sent con
gratulatory telegrams to the kings of
Rumania and Italy upon the recent
declarations of war issued by those
two countries. Premier Briand sent
similar telegrams to Premier Brat
iano of Rumania. Premier Boselli
Foreign Minister Sonnenino of Italy.
President Poincare's telegram to King
Ferdinand reads:
"At the time when the Rumanian
people are answering the appeal of
their oppressed brothers and entering
resolutely upon a glorious war in
which they find assurance of realiz
ing their national aspirations. I be
your majestiy to accept for himself
and for his noble country. France's
most cordial wishes.-'
Premier Briand's message to Prem
ier Bariano says the entire French
nation "applauds the decision by
which Rumania courageously takes its
place among the defenders of the
cause of right and of civilization."
Berlin Calm in Crisis.
Berlin. Aug. 2S. 5 p. m., (via Lon
don. Aug. 3:15 a. m.) Bulgaria
undoubtedly will follow Germany's
lead in declaring war on Rumania, in
the opinion of fount Ernst von Re
entlow, naval expert of the Tages
Zeitung. Von Reventlow writes:
"It may be assumed with certainty
that Germany and her allies had
counted upon Rumania's participation
in the war and have taken measures in
advance. In view of the geographical
situation, the presumption is permis
sible that military devc lopnient s arp
imminent, p was ( v ain that the
German empir would regard th"
"ause of its Austro Hungarian allies as
its own. AH i onsi'lrcl. Bulgaria un
doiihtprilv will fin the same."
The Vossische fining asserts that
"the merlf!j7f; ,,f Rumania in the war
means for Bulgaria a new military and
political objective."
The ppripio of Berlin received with
remarkah) calmness and resignation
th announcement of Rumania's dec
laration f w 3 r asrainst Austria-Hun-Sary
and tho German government's
6tep in recalling it minister to Buch
arest and declaring that a state of war
txisted between the two ountries.
The situation whs discussed tonight
in an cafes with the feeling that one
more or makes no difference. The
announcement that Rumanians had
Wn taken prisoner was greeted witn
general Katisfaction.
Meanwhile Berlin has a little Hu-
manian mys-tery of its own. Thus far
it has been impossible to locate Dr.
Eelgiman. i'ne Rumanian minister.
Rumanians Left In Park.
Sin cp early morning the Rumanian
consulate and legation have been be
sieged by Rumanian residents of Ber

came like a bomb out of blue sky. Ru

THE STRIKE ORDER

Washington, Aug. 29 The strike
order Issued by the railroad broth
erhoods two weeks a.sro, and which
is of course subject now to the out
come of the negotiations since un
dertaken by President Wilson, fol
low. The brotherhods have never de
nied that such an order had been
printed, and only required eon
tirmation to be put in effect. It
cannot, therefore, be designated as
a "secret order" or of taking any
advantage of the pending negofia-'
tions. It simply means that the
brotherhoods mean what they say,
and are prepared to strike, if ail
efforts to avoid the tie up fail:
Brotherhood of Locomotive En
gineers, Brotherhood of Locomot
ive Firemen, Order of Railway
Conductors, Brotherhood of Rail

DEFENSES OF
NATION GAIN
BY MEASURE
President Signs Army and
Navy Bill as Large Fac
tors for Preparedness.
NOTABLE GATHERING
Philippine Bill Also Receives
Signature of Executive in
Committees' Presence.
Washington, Ang. 29. President
Wilson today completed the admin
Istration preparedness legislative
program by signing the army and
navy appropriation bills. He also
signed the Philippines bill and the
new uniform bill of lading law.
He was surrounded by chairmen
and members of the house and sen
ate committees and army and naTy
officers.
"I think that the whole country will
feel," said President Wilson, "that this
congress has accomplished a very re
markable part of the program of na
tional defense. This bill that I have
signed for the army is merely the ap
propriation bill. It is not the bill by
which we reorganized the army, of
course you understand; but it does
carry with it a very much needed revi
sion of the articles of war, and it does
mean that the finances of the nation
are to stand behind the reorganization
of the army and its use for adequate
national defense.
"The navy bill is a very remark
able measure. Never before by one
single act of legislation has so much
been done for the creation of an ade
quate defense."
YEGGS GET GASH,
LOOT TWO BANKS
Robbers in Auto Blow Safes at Homer,
III, and Escape With $13,000
Booty.
Danville, 111., Aug. 29. A gang of
cracksmen, six in number, in a high
powered automobile, drove into Homer,
111., 14 miles west of here, at 12:30 this
morning, blew the safes in two banks,
got $13,000 in cash and made their es
cape, all in a half hour's time.
The Raynor and Babb bank lost $S,
500 and the Citizens' bank $4,500. It
was necessary for the banks to have
money shipped in from Danville and
Chicago this morning before they could
open for business. One dollar was left
in the vaults at Kaynor bank, while
$30 in cash was picked up in front of
the other bank after the robbery was
discovered.
The gang cut all wires except that
of the interurban line, which were
overlooked, otherw ise it would not have
been possible for Homer people to get
in communication with outside cities
and spread the alarm.
It was evident that the plans for the
robbery had been well laid, as the
two explosions were simultaneous, the
doors being blown off in each instance.
The explosion did not awaken t he town,
only two or three people having heard
it, and but one man saw the robbers
making their getaway with the booty.
The car went in a westerly direction
and came from the cast at midnight.
The postmaster at Homer had placed
all the government money he had on
hand in the Citizens' bank last night
and the town was absolutely without
money until the arrival of a supply
from Danville after the hanks here had
opened.
Chicago, Aug. 29. Detectives guard
ed all railroads and roads leading into
Chicago today in a hunt, for the safe
blowers who dynamited two banks at
Homer, 111. Police believe the robbery
was committed by Chicago men.

WALK OUT IS
NOW SET FOR
NEXT MONDAY
President Wilson Goes Be
fore Congress With Final
, Statement of Facts.
ASKS HELP IN CRISIS
Union Leaders Have Fixed
Upon Labor Day as Limit
of Men's Waiting.
Washington, Ang. 29, Presi
dent Wilson laid the railway
strike situation before congress at
2:30 o'clock this afternoon In an
address to both houses assembled
in Joint session. The president told
congress of his en"orts to bring
the railroad managers and the
men into some sort of agreement
and saying he was powerless to do
more, he asked congress to enact
specitic legislation to deal with the
sitnation now and in the future.
Just before the president went
to address congress It became
known that the strike leaders had
positively called the strike for
Labor day unless a favorable
settlement was reached before and
that the negotiations between the
managers and men had been
broken off.
Representatives of the railway man
(
agers and of the brotherhoods heard
the president make hiB address.
The four brotherhood heads were
guests of Speaker Clark in his gal
lery; other leaders of the men were in
other galleries, and the railway man
agers were scattered about. The sen
ate had marched over to the house
chamber and the Joint session was
seated and ready for the president at
2:30 p. m. Mrs.- Wilson, accompanied
by the ambassador to Great Britain,
Walter Hines Page, and the ambassa
dor to France, William G. Sharp, was
in the president's reserved space. Sev
eral members of the cabinet, including
Secretaries Lansing, Wilson, Baker
and some Justices of the supreme court
were present.
A committee consisting of Represen
tatives Kitchin, Fitzgerald and Mann,
and Senators Kern, Simmons and
Smoot, escorted the president into the
chamber. He was greeted with up
roarious cheers as he entered.
President Wilson shook hands with
Speaker Clark and Vice President
Marshall while the applause and
cheering continued. He began speak
ing at 2:33 o'clock.
Washington, Aug. 23. President
Wilson laid the threatened railway
strike before congress today in an
address to both houses assembled in
Joint session. He spoke as follows:
"Gentlemen of the congress:
"I have come to you to seek your as
sistance in dealing with a very grave
J situation which has arisen out of the
uemann or tne employes or the rail
roads engaged in freight train service
that they bo granted an eight hour
working day, safeguarded by payment
for an hour and a half of service for
every hour of work beyond the eight.
"The matter has been agitated for
more than a year. The public has been
made familiar with the demands of the
men and the arguments urged in favor
of them and even more familiar with
the objections of the railroads."
The president then explained that
the matter came some three weeks ago
to a final issue and resulted In a com
plete deadlock between the parties. He
pointed to the effect of a strike upon
the nation. He said that cities would
be cutoff from their food supplies, the
whole commerce of the nation para
lyzed, men of every sort and occupa
tion thrown out of employment.
President Sees Duty.
"Just so soon as it became evident
that mediation under the existing law
had failed and that arbitration had
been rendered Impossible by the atti
tude of the men." the president said,
"I considered it my duty to confer with
tho representatives of both the rail
ways and the brotherhoods and myself
offer mediation, not as an arbitrator,
but merely as spokesman of the nation,
in the interest of Justice, indeed, and
as a friend of both parties, but not aa
Judge, only as the representative of
100,000.000 of men, women and chil
dren who would pay the price, the In
calculable price of loss and suffering.
"It seemed to me, in considering the
subject matter of the controversy, that
the whole spirit of tho time and tho
preponderant evidence of recent eco
nomic experience spoke for the eight
hour day. It has been adjudged by
the thought and experience of recent
years a thing upon which society is
Justified In Insisting as in the Interest
of health, efficiency, contentment and
a general increase of economic vigor.
"I therefore proposed that the elgH
hour day b adopted by the railway
managements and put into practice for
the present as a substitute for the ex
isting 10 hour basis of pay and service;
that I should appoint, with tne permis
sion of the congress, a small commis
sion to observe the results of the
change, carefully studying the figure
of the altered operating costs, not only.
