HUNGARY
Declaration of Hostilities by
Balkan Kingdom Is Fol
lowed by Movement on
the Transylvanian Cities
London, Aug. 29.-Elghty thous
and Roumanian troops already ir
moving toward the Transylvanian
frontier for the Invasion of Hungary.
Advance guards of thta Roumanian
force have crossed the Hungarian
border In a swift advance on to two
TraniylTanlan cities of Hermann
etadt and Kranstadt. It la these
forcea which engaged tbe Teutona In
the Rothentburm pass, fifteen miles
from Hermannstadt and In the passes
few miles from Kranatadt. The
whole Roumanian troop movement Is
going forward like clockwork, advice
received here today Indicated. King
Ferdinand's armies, almost complete
ly mobilized and awaiting the word
of war. are prepared to strike quick
ly on whatever front the Roumanian
general staff determines to start Its
major campaign.
The Germans acted with equal
ewlftneaa In meeting the new enemy
In the Ralkana. Despatches from
t-aimanne today said that the Teutons
closed the Swiss frontier less than
an hour after Italy declared war on
Germany. The German general staff
knew this preceded a declaration
from Roumanla and It Is believed be
gan shifting troops eastward to rein
force the Austrlans several hours be
fore newa of the Roumanian declara
tion of war was generally known.
The first official statements re
porting the German capture of Rou
manian prisoners, came from the
German war office, Indication that
German troops already are stiffening
the Austrian lines along Roumanla's
frontier.
The whole Balkan war theater has
been set aflame by Roumanla's en
trance Into the war. Pro-ally dem
onstrations occurred In Athena and
the Venlxellst newspapers are re
newing their demand that Greece ent
r the war. Telegraphic advices from
Berlin today Indicated that Germany
Is watching the Greek situation with
some anxiety. From the same source
It was reported that Bulgaria has
taken "Important military stops" to
rounter upon the Roumanian declara
tion of war.

F1IIIER SOON
Berlin, Aug. 29. A great battle
may occur along the Roumanian
frontier within a few hours.
Itoumanla has been concentrating
large forcea along the Transylvanian
border for several days, the Tage
blalt reported today. Tbe Teutonic
forcea took prompt measures to guard
against a sudden invasion and have
massed sufficient troops to meet the
Roumanian attack.
The patrol skirmishes reported In
yesterday's official war office state
ment may mark the beginning of an
Important engagement.
Tbe Berlin newspapers commented
with great restraint today upon Rou
manla's entrance Into the war. The
general opinion of German critics Is
that Roumanla will play no Import
ant part In military affairs, except
that It will 'be necessary to re-group
the forces of the central powers to
somo extent to meet the new enemy.
The Lokal Anselger points out that
the Roumanian decoration of war
does not affect the food situation, be
cause Roumanla has exported little
food to Germany and Austria lately.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
held a lengthy conference today with
the leading ministers, Including Dr.
HelfTertch, vice-chancellor, and Un
der Secretary of Foreign Affairs Tre
utler Brautesstratur.
Tbe Ioknl Anselger announced to
day that Field Marshal von Macken
sen Is In command of tho Teutonic
armies In the Balkans.
"Tho people of the extended entente
will find us ready to meet the new
situation rreated by Roumanla's en
trance Into the war," said the Lokal
Anxelger. "Next to Hlndenburg on
the east front, Mackensen will now
begin a new bloody work In the Bal
kans. Now his time has come to
reap the harvest of long months of
quiet preparation."
Dispatches from Kronntadt, Tran
sylvania, six miles from the Rou
manian frontier, report that since
Sunday an unbroken stream of Ger
man and Austrian refugees have 'been
crossing the border from Roumanla.
They declare that Roumanla's declar
ation of war came as a complete sur
prise to the Inhabitants of Roumanla,
but that Russia, with a strong army
on the border, has for months been
threatening to Invade Roumanla un
less she Joined the allies.
TO
Rome, Aug. 89. Complete evacua
tion of Montenegro and Albania by
tho Austrlans will be the first result
of Roumanla's entrance, into the war,
Italian critics believed today. Tbe
early collapse of tho dual monarchy,
possibly by the end of the present
year, was predicted by a majority of
the Italian war experts. Despite de
nials from Vienna, tt has been learn
ed by the Italian military authorities
that Austria has withdrawn nearly a
whole army corps' from Montenegro
and Albania within the past six weeks
to check the Russian and Italian of'
fenelves, The new menace on the
Transylvanian frontier will force the
withdrawal of the remainder of the
Austrian forces, It Is believed here,
leaving only Bulgarian troops In Al
bania to resist the Italians. Serious
economic troubles, as well as Internal
disorders In Hungary, are expected
hero to follow a successful Invasion
Transylvania by Roumanians.
From Transylvania the Austro.
Germans have derived a large part
of their moot supply, as well as large
quantities of grain. ' ; ;
The Italian critics believe Rou
mania will strike her heaviest blow
In an Invasion ofransylvanla, prob
ably aided by Russian troops trans
ported across Roumanla.

Pres. Wilson Asks National Law-Making Body for Legis
lation Extending Powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, Establishment of Eight-Hour Day, and to
Prohibit Strike or Lock-Out Before Federal Inquiry
Washington, Aug. 29. As a dra
matic climax to hla unprecedented
negotiations to avert the most dis
astrous labor war that ever threat
ened the United States, President
Wilson this afternoon appeared be
fore a Joint session of congress, and
urged legislation "to safeguard the
life and Interest of the nation."
He said he nrged tbe legislation
"not In baste or merely as a means
of meeting a present emergency, hut
as permanent and necessary additions
jto the law, Indeed, by circumstances
we had hoped never to see, but Imper
ative as well as Just, If such emer
gencies are to be prevented In the
future.'
He recommended:
Enlarged Commerce Commission
Provision for the Immediate
enlargement and administrative re
organisation of the interstate
commerce commission, enabling the
commission to deal with the duttea
now devolving on It, "with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are
within Its present constitution and
means of action practically Impos
sible."
Establishment of an eight-hour
day as the legal basis alike of work
and of wages In the employment of
all railroad employes engaged In op
erating trains In Interstate transpor
tation. The time for the Institution of
this law Is to he determined by con
gress. The president suggested no
date.
Authorisation of the appointment
by the president of a commission to
study results In the application of
the eight-hour day to railroad opera
tion, alike for the men and for the
railroads; the Investigators to report
to congress at the earliest possible
date but without recommendation as
to legislative action.
Approval by congress of considera
tion by the Interstate state commis
sion of freight rate Increases to meet
such additional expenditures by the
roads as are rendered necessary by
adoption of the eight-hour day.
Provide Federal rrobe
Amendment of the federal law,
which provides for the mediation.
conciliation and arbitration of such
controversies as the present by add
Ing a provision that In case methods
of accommodation now ' nrovlded
should fall, a full public Investiga
tion shall be Instituted and completed
before a strike or lockout may law

CITIffllS MEET TO
FOR JOSEPHINE
.Because of the small attendance at
the meeting of citizens called to con
vene at the assembly room of the
Commercial club last night, another
meeting will be held at the same
place this evening, In the hope that
more of the merchants will be pre
sent. About 30 citizens were on hand
last night, and a lively discussion was
participated In hy several over ways
and means of giving the coming
county fair Its proper sotting,' how to
make the city more attractive during
fair week being the -principal theme.
Members of the fair board stated that
the exposition was completely fin
anced and that it would be the best
of military necessity, to take control
of such portions and rolling stock of
me railways as may be required for
military use and to operate them for
military purposes, with authority to
draft into the military service of tbe
country such train crews and admin
istrative officials as circumstances re
quire.
Tbe president outlined In detail his
efforts to effect a settlement of the
pending dispute through friendly ne
gotiations. His efforts, he said, had
"resulted In complete deadlock."
Now the country faces. Wilson said.
a great national calamity, with "cities
.cut off from food supplies and the
commerce of the nation paralyzed.
Countless thousands will, in all like
lihood, be brought, It may be, to the
very Point of stlrratfnn "
Mediation Has Failed
Mediation -under the existing laws
has failed, he admitted, and arbitra
tion has been rendered Impossible
"by the attitude of the men."
He said that be had offered the
eight-hour day as a ibasls of agree
ment, because "tbe whole Spirit of the
time and the preponderant evidence
of recent economic experience" spoke
out for it
In the face of Indications that the'
railroads would "ultimately be ob
liged to accept the eight-hour day by
concerted action of organized labor,
backed by the favorable Judgment of
society." they have declined to accept
this means of settlement, he said.
The railroads fear the Influence of
hostile shippers and they apparently
feel no confidence that the interstate
commerce commission could with
stand the objections that would be
made, Wilson said.
"They do not care to rely upon the
friendly assurancea of congress or the
president. They have thought It best
that they should be forced to yield.
If they must yield, not by counsel, but
by the suffering of the country."
President Wilson tonight at eight
o'clock will go to the Capitol again
to confer with Speaker Clark, Rep
resentative Kltchln, floor leader of
the house, Representative Mann, re
publican house leader, and Chairman
Adamson of the house Interstate com
mittee, and will urge early action on
his proposals.
Republicans manifested opposition
early today and indicated they would
need considerable time for debate.
Nevertheless, administration officials
feel that the entire program will go
.through within 10 days. '

"We do not assent to the statement
