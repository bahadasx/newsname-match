ed area one time even lightly. Then
we should have to wait for years to
make the second application, whicn
would be too costly even though sufficient
quantity could thus be had
-each year.
There is no Reason why all other
wis? idle lands should not be sown, to
rye in September and October to fur
nish this humus most cheaply and
M most abundantly from year to year,
and in addition to furnishing humus,
V it conserves plant food that would
AT otherwise leach out of the soil and
be lost. Such a cover crop, furtherW
more, prevents land from washing,
I which means a heavy loss to all hill
and rolling land.
Abruzzi rye Is the best know
rapid, vigorous growth, and makes
B Tiety lor this purpose as it makes a
p- It earlier than any other crop on or1
dinars land.
I It is a well known fact thiat one
heavy crop of rye turned land followed
by cotton or corn will, in a dry sea
k son, often make double tne yieia on
B poor land fertilized as similar land
E "without such a cover crop. This is
true because -water is the limiting
factor in crop production in a Iry
Br summer. The turned rye holds moist
I ure and gradually feeds the plant on
> the fertility present, when otherwise
*the crop would ruin of starvation in
(the midst of plenty of fertility which
i ii is unable to use for want of humus
to hold and supply moisture.
"With, rye, there is no inoculation
problem?just a negro job of scratching
about one bushel per acre in the
-cotton rows, corn rows, and on the
pea stubble in -September and October.
Even when clover or , vetcft is
used as a cover crop, rye should be
sown with them; for, humus is our
greatest need, and the two crops together
will furnish more of this material
than either one growing alone.
(Rye, furthermore, paves the way
for easier success with all winter
legumes in that it supplies the soil
with humus, which always makes j
easier the inoculation of the land J
for legumes. During July land [August

A "Home" Cue.
Friday, a. in., was "The Day" for
; the /^vlored Dooulation serving Mr.
George A. Epting. Broad grins,
eager anticipations well-groomed
dames and damsels, all sitting around
waiting for the announcement of
dinner that was yelled by the leader j
of the flock. We Just wondered j
where so many came from. Renters, j
croppers, wages, in fact every one;
tlnvt had wielded a lioe or plow on "his j
plantation belonged there that day.
Every child and .grandchild. TIioss}
that couldn't walk were carried and I
expected to do ample justice to tho
provisions so abundantly provided by
this big-hearted boss.
The cue was cooked by those two
expert cueist, Messrs Jim and George
. Epting. EverytWng wias cooked and
j seasoned "just right."
I Hash, pork, kid, pickles, slaw.
I tomatoes, rice, <bread, ice tea wa3
served about 50 of his white friends,
neighbors, a few ladies were present.
Then his colored population of 67
was served the same fare, all .they
could eat. The "chiaingang" was remembered.
The bosses, Werts and
Teague came to the table, while
dinner was sent the gang 13 in number
wiho are camping in Mr. Epting's
pasture while working the county
roads. Even the gang's dogs were |
fed. Everything was well ordered
and quiet. The hostess was untiring
in her efforts to please the crowd /and
see tliat all was as it should be. This
was a "Red Letter" day for the
darkies. Am afraid Mr. Epting will
have to add several new dwellings for
another year, he will be -besieged
by labor.
