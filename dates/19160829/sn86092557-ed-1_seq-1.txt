ENGINEER DULL SAW
HOLT ON THE TRACK
Did Not Suspect at the Time
That the Object Was a
Man.
George Dull, Baltimore and Ohio
railroad engineer, yesterday testified
before tho coroner's Jury tnat he saw
Brooks Holt lying on the track just
before he permitted his engine to run
over hTm but that he thought it was
some inanimate object, possibly part
of a coat or piece of tree. He contend
ed that the accident was unavoidable.
The Jury found that because Dull
aid not apply his emergency brakes
upon seeing an unusual object on the
track Holt came to his death. The JBry
aid not say "carelessness," neither did
it say "unavoidable" but it framed the
verdict in such a manner that either
could be inferred.
Dull testified that he saw the ob
ject when S00 feet away from it. That
about the time he was 300 feet away
he could tell It was the body of a man
and that he then applied his high
Bpeed brakes. He ran 400 feet and

Isn't He Mean Looking? Asks
Woman Slayer as She Looks at
Picture of the Man She Shot
Tragedy Occurred in tamp
Where Georgia's Militia
is Mobilized
victim capTspratling
He Was a Physician And
Woman Says He Hound
ed Her.
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)^
tie Mattie Adams sat In her cell and
gazed at the newspaper picture of
the militia officer she had billed.
"Isn't he mean looking?" she re
remarked. "But he looks worse with
his hat off."
That was her epitaph for the man
she killed, because, she says, he ruin
ed her life a year ago!
Despite her slender form and light
blue eyerf that look at you trustingly
from under her low-done blonde hair,
Matie Adams is a married woman,
mother of three children and soon to
be the mother of four! You would
take her to be 24 but she says she is
30.
Capt Edgar J. Spratling was her
victim, shot down in his tent short
ly after Mrs. Adams alighted from the
Atlanta train and tripped out to the
mobilization camp.
The girl-woman gave herself up to
militia authorities after the shooting.
Spratling, prominent Atlanta physi
cian had insulted her when she went
to his office for treatment a year ago,
she said here, according to the police,
and her husband, H. C. Adams. Atlan
ta laundryman said the same thing in
Atlanta.
Spratling is married but has no
children.
"This man has been hounding my
wife for weeks," said Adams in Atlan
ta. "She is Justified In killing him if
any person ever was."
Mrs. Maud Monk, former Atlanta
hotel keeper who is here, declared
Spratling had told her Mrs. Adams
was nagging him and had written him
letters asking that she be installed
in a boarding house in Macon so she
could be near him.
"That's a lie," Mrs. Adams declared
in her cell. "I never heard of this
Monk woman! I never wrote Dr.
Spratling a letter. They can't show
any letter he ever got from me!"
When discrepancies, jvere pointed
out in her stories she said:
"I didn't know what I was saying
yesterday!"
When she didn't want to answer she
Jus tturned her head away and looked
at the tops of the green trees along
Mulberry street.
Although Mrs. Adams now Insists
she had not seen Dr. Spratling for a
year, the doctor's books, according to
his nephew, indicates she had called
at his ofTice several times this month,
and htat he had operated on her son
for tonsilitis last week.

President Wilson Appeared Befo
Joint Session of Congress This Afte
noon and Made Report on
Entire Situation
HE HAS COilEWUII PRQGRA
Men Have Already Announced That They Are Op_
to One Part of It?Compulsory Investi*
gation and Publicity,
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2D.?Direct
negotiations between railroad execu
tives and the employes through Presi
dent Wilson were practically closed
today when the executives refused to
acceded to a proposal made to them
yesterday by Mr. Wilson and present
ed to hira a statement of their posi
tion containing another argument for
arbitration.
The statement presented to Presi
dent Wilsons by the committee of
eight denies that the sentiment of so
ciety favors an eight-hour day and
declared that arbitration is the only
proper way of settling Industrial dis
putes.
The suggestion of President Wilson
for a program Including the principal
of an eight-hour day but postponing
its effectiveness for a-year pending
investigation, was rejected by the rail
road executives at a conference this
morning. The action of the railroad
presidents taken in connection with
the strike order of the employes left
President Wilson no alternative but
to go to congress in a final efTort to
avert the strike by legislation.
While President Wilson was an
nouncing that he would lay the rail
road strike situation before congress
at 2:30 o'clock today the Brotherhood
leaders rejected the latest proposi-i
tion of the committee of railway presi
dents and actually ordered the strike
to begin at seven a. m. Labor day un
less settlement satisfactory to them is
reached in the meantime. Their prev
ious order for a strike was tentative
and required a secret signal to put
it into effect.
Unless a settlement satisfactory to
the labor leaders is reached before
that time or unless President Wilson
and Congress find some way to pre
vent it, the strike would start Labor
day without further notice.
The labor leaders admittedly took
action the first thing today in the be
lief that some means was being sought
to prevent a strike actually being
called. By their action they think
they have anticipated any legal pro
cesses which might be brought against
them.
President Wilson made his decision
to address congress in Joint session
at 2:30 o'clock soon after the decis
ion of the labor leaders became known.
Arrangements were made at the cap
itol for the House and Senate to as
semble in the hall of the House to hear
th? President's proposed legislation
which has been agreed upon by ad
ministration leaders.
Shortly after 10:30 a telephone call
came to the White House from rail
road executives to the effect that the
committee of eight would like to see
President Wilson. He had engage
montB up until one o'clock but he in
formed the executives that he would
jee them If possible. Later the Pres
ident sent word to the executives he
would see them at eleven o'clock and
postponed a cabinet meeting to do
so.
The Brotherhood leaders declared
after their meeting this morning that
?nothing but a "efitiBfactory settle
ment" could prevent their men from
walking out. The leaders take the
position that the strike already order
ed they could not be prevented by
legal processes from making it ef
fective while it left them free to call
it off if a settlement satisfactory to
them is reached.
The legislative program prepared for
congress includes the following meas
ures:
An eight-hour day law for railroad
employes so framed as to give the
railroads time to prepare for it; and,
A law patterned after the Canadian
industrial disputes act providing for
investigation of industrial disputes on
railroads by a commission and pro
hibiting strikes or lockouts pending
the outcome of the investigation.
In addition to these measures there
are under consideration a resolution
to Increase the revenues of the rail
roads In case the expenses are increas
ed, and a law creating authority for
the operation of the railroads undew
the federal government In event of a
strike. The plan tonight was to have
the first two measures Introduced aa
amendments to tlie bill, which has al
ready passed the house, increasing the
Interstate Commerce Co:"
from 7 to 9 members. ? "as

the greatest obstacle to labor that ever
has been dovlsed. Invariably and I!
spoak from experience in dealing with
railroads, the railroad heads have used
the delay guaranteed them by law to
prepare for a strike. '
"The eight-hour day proposal, t
to carry, as it will of course, any ref

our present demands and not be *
ly satisfactory to us. It would have
