country if the railroads are tied tip, was said to he determined to
prevent a strike at any cost. In his conferences with executives he
strongly urged that they change their hitherto unyielding altitude,

the executives should be given most careful consideration.
Final arrangements for the appearance of thei president before
Congress were not completed, but he discussed the question fully
with the Democratic steering committee of the Senate and they
agreed with him that he should address a joint session.
Throughout the night there appeared to be come possibility that
an agreement might he reached on a plan which would include
concessions of the eight hour day, but postponements of its effec
tiveness until the railroads had had an opportunity to prepare for it

Republicans in Congress to the legislative suggestions of the presi
dent, administration leaders think it will be possible to get the laws
through within a reasonable time.

withiu half an hour after the president had left the capitol. They
hurried from their hotel to the executive mansion and arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock, while the president was at dinner. Their
conference with the president was brief. He handed one copy of
the, railroad's counter proposal to A. 1$. Garrctson, spokesman of
the employes, and said he would not discuss it in any way. It is
