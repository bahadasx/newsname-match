ested by the executives and after a
rolonged discussion of the situation
t tho Capitol with the members of tho
?etnocratlc sflcering committee of the
enate.
The proposition of the railroad execu

When the railroad brotherhood heads
vent to the White House to-night the
'resilient not only l?ud before them the
dan of the. executives, but strongly
irged the withdrawal of a tentative
trike order sent out yesterday, sub
eot to release, calling for a walkou'
if the 400,000 members at " A. M. on
<abor Day, September 4. This request
van flatly refused, the leaders saying
?nly the committee of f.10. which left
.Vashlngton yesterday, it.id power to
eoall the order
C.'opies of the strike order wero
?rought to the President's attention
ifter they had gotten into the posses
ion of the railroad executives.
In spite of the apparent final failure
?>f his efforts, the President was re
torted to-night as being still hopeful
?f averting a strike.
Although on the surface a nation
wide railroad strike was nearer to
night than it had ever been, confidence
was) expressed in ofllcial quarters that
the steps under consideration would
nave the effect of preventing the walk
out. The President, realizing the dis
aster which would come to the country
if the railroads are tied tip. v.-is said
to be determined to prevent a strike at
any cost. In his conferences with tho
executives he strongjy urged that they
change tholr hitherto unyielding atti
tude. and when lie saw tho emplo\crs
he declared that all suggestions from
the executives should i>e Riven most
careful attention. Final arrangements
for the appearance of the President
before Congress were not completed to-"
night, but he discussed the question
fully with the Democratic steering
committee of the Senate, and they
agreed with him that he should ad
dress a Joint session.

The time of his appearance depends
largely upon further conferences to
morrow with the executives and the
employees.
At to-day's conference the railroad
conferees did not formally present the
statement agreed on by them last 1-ri
day night, which amounted to a flat
refusal of his plan of settlement. This
'statement has been signed by all the
executives, but its presentation was
withheld in the. interest of peace. The
President was informed generally of
its terms, however.
Throughout the day there appeared
to be some possibility that an agree
ment might be reached on a plan which
would Include concession of the eight
hour day, but postponement of its ef
fectiveness until the railroads bad had
an opportunity to prepare for it. Hope
of persuading the railroad managers to
I agree to such a plan had not been given
I >Up to-night.
After thoir conference with Mr.
Wilson the executives gave out a state
ment in which they said they had laid
j before the President a "suggestion in
the nature of a proposition for progress
' toward a solution of the questions at
issue."
Although it seems certain that there
will bo opposition from Representa
tives in Congress to the legislative sug
gestions of tho President, administra
tion leaders think it will bo possible to
get the laws through within a reason
able time.
The visit of the brotherhood heads
to the White House came within half
..?in hour after the President had left
li'ho Capitol. They hurried from their
Kfotel on foot to the executive mansion
|?.iid arrived shortly after 7 o'clock,
while the President was at dinner.

Leaders Decide Negotiations
Must End One Way or An

WASHINGTON. August 2S.?Labor
Day, Monday. September 4. is the date
11 x e?l for the strike in the tentative
orders prepared by the ' railroad
brotherhoods and carried home by the
members of the committee of 640 when
they left Washington yesterday. It
was learned to-day that the brother
hood leaders decided negotiations here
must end one way or another before
the foregoing date.
The strike order is br;*f. It. is ad
dressed to ail members of the four
brotherhoods, is signe.i by the various
general chairmen, and reads as fol
lows:
"Sirs and Brothers,?This is to advise
that the vote of the employees in train
and engine service on the eight-hour
day and time and one-half overtime
proposition was overwhelmingly in
favor of a strike. Notwithstanding
this yotir representatives have been un
able to effect a satisfactory settlement,
find a strike under the laws of the re
spective organizations becomes effec
tive on September 4, 1915, at 7 A. M.
"Impart this information so those
affected will know they are promptly
to obey."
On separate sheets the conduct ex
pected of members is set forth. Among
the duties of members set forth arc
these:
"No man In road service involved in
the strike will perform any service
after the hour set to strike, unless he
has already begun a trip, and has
actually left the terminal If the train
has left the terminal he will complete
tho trip and deliver the. engine and
train at the end of the r'in. or tie-up
point, if tied tip under ;he law, after
which h*? will perform no further ser
vice until the close of tho strike. Men
in other than road service will leave
the service at the appointed tline.
"So far as votir legal right to strik*
is concerned, there Is no difference be
tween a mail triin and a freight train.
Von have Identically the same rieht to
refuse to perform service on a malt
train as you have to refuse to perform
service on a freight train
"All men on strike will keep awav
from the company's property except
such men as are designated certain
nuties to be performcl by tho au
thority of organizations.

chairman of the I ?emocratic Congrcs

The committee heads asked for more
.speakers for .Maine, hut Speaker Clark
reminded them that despite !he im
portance of the Maine election, it was
essential to maintain a quorum of the
House for action on important busi
ness to he disposed of before adjourn
ment.
Representative Williams. ?.f Illinois,
proposed the need of more Democratic
literature for German-A mcrican
newspaper readers.
Mr. McCormick said that tlie greatest
problem that confronted the party was
sretting its case before the public, as
war and other International affairs had
crowded the campaign off tho front
paces of the newspapers. He told how
it was planned t" ha\e a rousing Dem
ocratic start In Maine and then carry
on the tipht actively elsewhere, concen
trating In the doubtful States and not
wasting ammunition on the certain dis
t ricts.
Mr. Cummings, head of the speakers*
bureau, told the confsrence there wet'
States In which the Democrats had the
right to expect victory. He said re
ports from Maine werp "so encouraging
as to he almost too astonishlnc to be

teen Representatives volunteer to add
to the speakers* schedule for Maine.
Speaker Clark, who recently returned
from Maine, reported that the audiences
there, instead of bei;)c ?Void," were
"most appreciative, an.! that ho had
never found it easier to make speeches

but the suspension so far has not been
revoked for them.
The original order for sending south

service was issued by the War Depart
ment In order that the divisional units

The department now has derided that
the strike situation may continue un
chnnged for some time. Tho officials
are anxious to complete the divisional
organization on the border, in order
that full advantage may be taken of
the opportunity to train a large num

the greatest, enthusiasm in London.
Special editions of the newspapers an- ,

In diplomatic circles the impression 1

Turkey will declare war on Houmanla, '
owing to the latter'* declaration
against their ally. A dispatch from j
Berlin said the Roumanian minister i
! would be handed his passports to-day.

eral belief in Paris is that Rounuinia's ,

Some of the more optimistic military

extreme fall in prices whs 11 1-4 cents,!
an amount virtually a parallel to the j
extraordinary rise witnessed two years j
ago on the day that hostilities began.
Transactions measured in millions of
bushels.
It was the view that the end of the
war had perhaps been greatly hastened
which in the main brought about to
day's big drop in quotations. Even tho
most conservative traders seriously
discussod the chance that at least by
a speedy opening of tho Dardanelles
vast stores of Russian grain soon would
reach Western Europe, as a result of

i ROUMANIAN MINISTER
PltF.SKNTS NOTIC l'KHSO\AI-I<Y
AMSTERDAM. August *JS (via Lon
don).?The note declaring that Row
mania from !> o'clock Sunday evening
considered herself in a state of war
with Austria-Hungary was presentod
to the Austro-IIungarian Foreign Min
ister last night by the Roumanian min
ister at Vienna, who personally^ visited
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ac
cording to a dispatch received here to?
I day from the Austrian capital.
Rukharest dispatches received on
Sunday stated that King Ferdinand of
Roumania had convened a conference
of representatives of all the political
parties, former Premiers, former presi
dents of the legislative chambers, min
isters and government representatives,
with the idea of ascertaining the views
! of all sections of public opinion.
Roumania becomes tho fourteenth
I nation to Join the war. Iler intervon
I tion either on the side of the allies or
| the central powers has been awaited
with symptoms of concern by both
since the beginning of the great con
flict. This is due not entirely to Rou
manians military strength, but also to
the strategic advantages of her geo
graphical position and the fact that her
jentry into the struggle opens to tho
j Russian army a gateway through to
! Roumania to attack the Bulgarians
; from the north, while the allied armies,
i having their base at Salonikt, attack
| them and their German allies from tho
1 south. Nevertheless, Roumania's tnill
j tary strength is by no means incon
! slderable. The country has a popula
j tion of 6,800,000, and her army has been
; estimated at 580,000. It often has been
; described as one of the most thorough
i ly equipped and disciplined armies In
| Europe. but recent information from
! Rukharest has thrown some doubt upon
j its quality. Lately it has been stated
' that Roumanian officers are ill-trained
: and undisciplined, that Roumania has
no heavy artillery and that its flying
j service is Inferior. Some advocates of
| Rouinunia's participation in the war
j have asserted that she could mobilize
' as many as 1,000.000 men. The tno
! bili/.ation of her army has been in prog
ress for months, and a few days ag-j
was reported to be complete.
KNTKIl.H WAR TO SATISFY
"NATIONA1. ASPIRATIONS"
The motive which prompts Roumania
to enter the war is the satisfaction of
her "natural aspirations," described by
Take Jonescu, the Roumanian Liberal
leader, as the "policy of national in
stinct." Concisely, this means national
expansion. In the southern half of
Bukowina, the Austrian crown land, tho
Roumanians are the dominant race.'
