BEST OF. 'EM ALL
WAS K. P. FAIR THIS YEAR SAY
OLD-TIME FAIR MEN.
Big Crowd Was Present Friday, Last
Day And Enjoyed Splendid Show
Of Stuff Notes.
The great K. P. fair of 1916 is
now a memory. The fair closed last
Friday afternoon, with a splendid
crowd present, and with a magnifi
cent roadster ring as the finale.
That this year's fair was the best
cf them all is conceded by everyone:
Loth from point of attendance and
the show of stock of different kinds.
Old fair-goers all declared that as an
old-fashioned country fair, the Stan
ford exhibition is without a peer in
the state.
Indications are that the fair will
be a satisfactory financial success.
But for the first day's bad weather,
its financial success would have been
abundant. The cold rain the first day
completely spoiled the attendance re
ceipts for that day. The weather on
Thursday and Friday was ideal, how
.ever, and the people turned out in
large numbers.
The feature of the last cay's ex
hi ) tion was the roadster j ing, which
v.? won by Senator R. L. Ilubble's
great mare Ailsa Page, driven by her
trainer and handler, Mack Hughes,
of Danville. Bob Mitchell, of llai
rodsburg, made a strong bid for this
ri-g, tut was clearly outclassed by
the magnificent Hubble mare and her
victory met with the greatest popular
approval. This is the ninth blue the
mare has won this season out of 10
shows. During the driving in this
ring, Mitchell got a tumble when he
attempted to cut across in front of
the Hubble mare, most unfairly,
many thought. He was slightly cut
alout the face, but was not seriously
injured, and remounted and drove
his speedy gelding to the red ribbon.

Announces For Sheriff
J. H. Livingston, of East End, Out
For Democratic Nomination.
Notwithstanding the fact that
many democrats hoped that the cam
paign for the county offices which
will be decided next year, would not
open until after are presidental elec
tion in November, it has already
started by the announcement of J.
H. Livingston, for the Democratic
nomination for Sheriff, made in to
day's I.' J. Mr. Livingston has not
been previously actively identified
with political affairs, but is a well
known and respected young farmer
of the East End of the county. He
says he will make an active campaign
for the nomination. Mr. Livingston
issued the following card to the Dem
ocrats of Lincoln county:
To the voters of Lincoln county
I will be a candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination for sheriff of Lin
coln county at the next primary
election. As there are some more
people in the west end of the coun
ty named Livingston and in order
that you may not become confused,
will say, I am a son of Eld. J. G.
Livingston and live with him near
Crab Orchard. The east end of the
county has not had a sheriff in my
recollection and has had nothing but
the Jailer's place. For this reason
alone, I think you owe this nomina
tion to the east end. I have never
asked for an office and am not able
to buy it. Why vote Jor men that
are able to buy the office and men
who have had the place before? I be
lieve in dividing the thing up and let
ting the poor man and the country
man share the offices. I want the
voters to consider these things be
fore pledging themselves to soma
one else and see what good reason
you can give for not supporting me.
My reputation is open for inspection
and my references are anyone's wha
knows me. Hoping to see you all
before a very great while I am resp't.,

AUTOS HIT ON WINDING ROAD
Hill Spalding, of Lexington, for
merly of Stanford, and Mr. and Mrs.
Ned Smitn, all well known here, had
a narrow escape from a serious auto
accident last Saturday morning, when
starting up the tortuous hill on the
north side of the Brooklyn Bridge.
They were just rounding a turn when
a Danville man in a Ford came scoot
ing down the hill like lightning and
crashed into them. The Danville
party's wife, who was with him was
badly cut and bruised in the smash
up which followed, but luckily none
of Sir. Spalding's party received any
thing worse than a severe shaking
up. Mr. Spalding's Grant roadster
was somewhat damaged. The Dan
ville man hurried away with his wife
to a physician soon after the acci
dent. Neither car was put out of
commission by the collision. The
pike on each side of Brooklyn bridge
is very steep and very winding and
most motorists negotiate it slowly
both ways, and horns constantly kept
blowing.

Just the Thing for Diarrhoea.
"About two years ago I had a severe
attack of diarrhoea which lasted for
over a week," writes W. C. Jones,
Buford, N. D. "I became so weak
that I could not stand upright. A
druggist recommended Chamber
lain's Colis, Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy. The first dose relieved me
as well as ever." Many druggists
recommend this remedy because they
know that it is reliable. Obtainable
everywhere.

HORSE FELL 'DEAD
r
j
Ju
PROBABLY ALL THAT SAVED
HARTWELL SHANK'S LIFE
Well Known Local Boy Dragged Un
DrL
der Cart For 100 Yards When
Runaway Dropped Dead.
Except for the fact that the horse
he was driving dropped dead within
a space of 100 yards, after it turned
him out of the cart and started to
run away, dragging the young man
beneath, Hartwell Shanks, son of Mr.
and Mrs. W. C. Shanks, would have
probably dragged. to a horrible death
last Friday afternoon. The young
man was badly shaken upand bruis
ed as it was, but not seriously, and
was able to attend the dance that
night. Shanks' escape was a very
narrow one, and a very lucky one,
however. He had been riding over
Rural Route No. 3 as substitute for
regular carrier A. C. Hill, who was
at the fair. Just as he turned out
of the Boneyville lane, at Mr. T. D.
Newland's onto the Somerset pike,
he wrapped the reins over one arm
and was sorting the mail which had
been collected. A wire brace for a
fence around H. C. Baughman's farm
was struck by the cart, and over it
went with young Shanks beneath it,
the reins wrapped about his arm. His
horse frightened by the accident,
immediately broke into a dead run,
and started down the road, dragging
Shanks beneath the cart. Almost in
front of the residence of W. T. Tuck
er, scarcely 100 yards from where
the cart went over, the animal drop
ped dead, from a ruptured blood ves
sel, veterinarians say. This undoubt
edly saved the boy's life. When
friends got to him, he was pinioned
under the wreckage of the cart, and
it is believed that nothing could have
saved his life had the horse contin
ued on its mad run, dragging the
overturned vehicle and its helpless
human freight beneath it.
The youngster gamely made light
of his injuries, and after they had
been dressed, attended the fair later
in the afternoon and the dance that
evening.
DANVILLE PIKE CLOSED
County Road Engineer Riffe has
asked the I. J. to notify auto travel
lers that the Danville pike will be
closed at the bridge below Jop Rank
in's place for a week or so to auto
travel. The old wooden bridge,
which has always given so much
trouble has been taken out during
the course of reconstruction of the
pike under the state-aid system, and
a new concrete structure is being put
in in its place. The crossing at the
creek is so steep and precarious,
however, that autoes will be unable
to negotiate it. Mr. Riffe says, and
for that reason, those who desire
to travel in motoi cars to the capital
of Boyle, had best select some other
route," until the new concrete bridge
is finished.

The display of high class pure

FALL TERM OF GRADED SCHOOL
BEGINS NEXT MONDAY
Numerous Changes Made In Faculty
And Prospects For Session Are
Most Auspicious.
The Stanford Graded and High
School resumes its work on next
Monday, Sept. 4th. Present pros
pects are most flattering for a suc
cessful year's work. The faculty
has much new blood in it, and has
been greatly strengthened in a num
ber of departments. Much regret
has been occasioned, however, over
late news from Miss Bertha Jackson,
now in California, that she will be
unable to take charge of the express
ion department, tho she at first de
cided to accept the offer made her
and so wired the board.
The High School teachers will be,
in addition to Supt. W. C. Wilson,
Prof. W. R. Todd, who -is already
well known here. He is an honor
graduate of Central University, hold
ing two degrees from that institu
tion, and in addition to this is un
usually well equipped to have charge
of all of the outdoor and athletic
activities of the students, having been
a star of the C. U. football team dur
ing his college work. Others of the
high school faculty, who come well
recommended are Miss Frank Wall
er, of Madisonville, and Miss Eliza
beth Farra, of Nicholasville. Miss
Clara Peck, of Middlesboro, a new
member, will have charge of the
Eighth grade work. Miss Sallie Bur
dett, of this city, will again teach the
Seventh grade and Miss Elizabeth
Matheny, of the countv, will teach
the Sixth grade; Miss Marie Ballard,
of Garrard county, has been engaged
to teach the Fifth grade; Miss Lu
cille Stone, of Burgin. comes to have
charge of the Fourth grade; Miss
Jennie Newland, of this city, teaches
the Third grade again: Mrs. H. D.
Phillips will teach the Second crade
and Miss Annie McKinney the First
grade. The piano department, will,
of course, be in charge of Miss Ellen
Ballou. and the Public School Music,
Miss Elizabeth Higgins.
Supt. Wilson requests that all pu
pils who attended at the College
building last vear to report at that
building at 8.30 A. M. on the date of
opening and all other pupils wiil be
present at the Graded School Build-inn-
nt 9:15 A. M. on the same date.
There will be a half day session on
Monday.
LANCASTER COURT DAY
A fairly good crowd attended Lan
caster court Monday, but business
was not brisk in any line. There
were only 14 cattle on the market
and they did not sell. They were
brought by J. Matt Craig, of Rock
castle, who had to take them back
with him. Some mule trading was
done, W. B. Burton, buying a half
dozen at $125 to $175. Jay Lee
Murphy bought several around the
first figure. Several war horses
changed hands at from $90 to $110.
Hon. Ed Morrow, of Somerset, spoke
at the- court-houae in the afternoon
to a full house and made, as he al
ways does, a good speech. He laud
ed Nominee Hughes to the skies, told
of the great things the Republican
party has done, and of course inform
ed his hearers that Hughes would
sweep the country in November. His
effort was loudly applauded and was
enjoyed by democrats as well as re
publicans. He is a fascinating speak
er and is good to hear, whether one
agrees with him or not.
The Sick Folks

quite so well the last few days, his
many friends regret to know.
Both Ben Jennings and Hence Ov
erstreet, typhoid fever victims at

ed upon for appendicitis at Danville, (

Latest War News
Rumania Monday declared war on
Austria-Hungary, a challenge which
was promptly answered by a simialr
declaration against the Balkan State
by Berlin. The first clash has already
occured on the Hungarian frontier
and the object of the attacks seems to
be to take Kronstadt and Hermann
stadt, two important towns in Tran
sylvania. The Allies are very much gratified
at the entrance of Rumania, and thp
undercurrent feeling seems to be on
both sides that Greece will enter the
lists against the Central Powers soon.
Berlin records the capture of the
heights south of Zbrosko by the Bul
garians, and the repulse of Serbian
counter attacks on Mount Seganske.
Paris reports the Serbs have made
considerable progress near Vetrenika
and have repulsed with heavy losses
Bulgarians on the road from Bancia
to Ostrovo.
The French report further pro
gress east of Delville wood and near
the Monquette farm, in the Somme
region, while London reports the
shelling of British positions by Ger
mans, especially between Pozieres
and and the Thiepval wood and re
ciprocal bombardments at other
points.
From the Riga to the Carpathian
passes there have been engagements
between Russians and Austro-Ger-man
forces.
Germany and Italy at last are at
war. Italy has ended the anomalous
situation4 that has existed for months
by declaring that from today she con
siders herself the enemy of her for
mer ally.
Despite bad weather there has been
considerable fighting and a renewal
of mine warfare along the British
front in France. London reports the
capture of 200 yards of a German
trench Saturday night.
