SEES BEST FIELD
FOR COLONIZING
IN AUSTRALIA
Japanese Author Makes Inter
esting Statements to World
Powers in His Lecture
About 300 Japanese attended the
second lecture- given by Kazan Kaya
hara at the Japanese Central Instl
tue on Nuuanu street Monday; night
In part, the lecturer said that funda
mental peace with the United States
and Japan is the only way to alienate
Australia from Great Britain, "for
colonization by the. Japanese across
the sea there are only the South
American countries, the United States
and Canada, besides the South Sea
Islands and Australia. But among
these counties we must choose a
country where there are not too many
inhabitans before us. On this point
Australia should be chosen, as there
are only four men to one square 'mile
in that country, and sufficient ground
for our settlements and colonies.
"We" have some reasons to bring
this matter before the powers. The
Japanese government should make a
strong protest when her subjects are
refused admission to any country. If
we cannot do it diplomatically, we can
do it some other way.
"The Anglo-Japanese treaty is of
little use to Japan. Why then can
we not form an alliance with Ger
many, to succeed in our plans? Our
diplomatists must bear such import
ant questions in their minds..
"Of the so-called powers in the
world there will remain only the
United States, Germany, Russia, Ja
pan and Great Britain. France, Italy,
Austria and, China will not be counted
in the future as great world powers."

a good deal of mining development
at several places. He also bought a
large ranch a Covelo and has been
operating it. He visited Honolulu two
