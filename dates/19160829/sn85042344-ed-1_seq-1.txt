KDKLOATES selected by the vari
ous tribes and clans of the Cher
okee nation throughout northeastern
Oklahoma will gather in Tulsa 'Octo
ber 2 to a general convention for the
purpose of taking some action in re-
MucHting and urging the government
to reimburse the members ot the na
tion for money and lands taken by
the government for negroes, their for
mer slaves, according to an announce
ment mado by leuders of the nation.
The lands involved represent at least
$30,000,000. The lands were taken bv
a treaty of 1N66.
oeclsion in the matter was made bv
the leaders in tho fifht ut a meeting
on the "4th day of August. The fol
lowing action was taken ut thut time:
Whereas, the Cherokee Indian peo
ple have always resented and protested
the ninth article of the treaty of 1K66,
whereby the negroes their former
slaves were granted certuin alleged
rights in tho Cherokee nutlon; this
treaty being made und forced on the
Cherokee people right after the rav
ages of the Civil war, under threats
by the agents of the government that
H not agreed to by tho ( herokees their
lands and property would be confis
cated and taken from them; and,
Whereas, we affirm the treaty of
183.", that these lands were sold to
the Cherokee Indian people, not their
slaves, and for which the Cherokee
people ceded untold millions of dol
dais' worth of lands, their old homes
in North Carolina, Georgia and Ten
nessee and portions of other states for
the then wilderness, now u portion of
Oklahoma, which they were forced to
move to in 183S, and a paltry 15,000,-
000, w hich was grossly Inadequate for
the vast country ceded to the govern
input; und,
Whereas, the Cherokee Indian peo
ple, utter coming west of the Missis
slppi river, rnude this wilderness blos
som as tho rose; and,
Whereas, the government had no
moral or legal right to exact equal al
lotments of our iHnds for our negro
slaves, any more than It could huve
had to compel all the slave-holding
states their lands with their former
slaves; but It did so exact an equal
division of Cherokee lands with their
former slaves and their descendants,
when It allotted the Cherokee lands;
and,
Whereas, the Cherokee people
should not be made to suffer this
great and egregeous wrong, which
robbed them of a great portion of
their heritage; and,
Whereas, we resent the Imputation
mode by some people thot any offi
cial of tho Cherokee nation did by
any act, officially or othrwise, agree
to bind the Cherokee people to any
act confirming the allotment of Cher
okee lands to freed men and their
descendants, but protested this action
of the government as unjust and un
fair; for It Is a well known principle
of law that property held lawruny
cannot be confiscated or diverted
from its legal channel; ana every
treaty between the t'nitd States gov

firmed the title of these lands to tne
Cherokee" Indian people, not to their
