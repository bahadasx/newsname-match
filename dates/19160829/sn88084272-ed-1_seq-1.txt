WASHINGTON. D. C, Aug. 29.
President Wilson laid the rail
way strike situation before

his efforts to bring the railroad man

I Pointing out the distress and hard
ships which a naUonwldesfrrkewoald

asked congress to empower Tito to
draft Into the service of the United
States the very managers and men who
have been unable to adjust their dif
ferences so that the government may
operate the railroads In case of mili
tary necessity.
He proposed that congress first en
lane the membership of the interstate
commerce commission to equip it to
deal with larger situations, second,
that an eight-hour day be established
for all trainmen in interstate com
merce: third, that a commission inves
tigate the effect of the eight-hour day;
fourth, that the interstate commerce
commission consider the increased cost
of the eight-hour day in making rates,
and fifth, amend the mediation law to
prevent strikes or lockouts while In
dustrial disputes are being Investi
gated. The sixth proposal was that the pres
ident be empowered to operate. tht
railways In case ot military necessity.

carried out president Wilson left en
tirely in the hands of congress.

son's plan and giving their reason.
Would Yield Tly Suffering.
"They have thought it best" said
the president referring to the railway
nagers in his address to congress,
"that they should be forced to yield, if
they must yield, not by counsel but
by the suffering of the country."

were in progress." the president con
tinued, "when to all outward appear
ances those conferences had come to
a standstill, the representatives of the
brotherhoods suddenly acted and set
the strike for the 4th of September."
IVlNon Could Onry Ironoe.
Thus the president summarized his
efforts, and added:
"But I could only propose. I could
not govern the will of others who took:
an entirely different view of the dr

Tblntu Railroad Must Yield.
The president was greeted with great
applause when he said he regarded It
as "practical certainty" that the rail

accept the eight hour day by the con
certed action of organized labor, backed
by the favorable Judgment of society."
