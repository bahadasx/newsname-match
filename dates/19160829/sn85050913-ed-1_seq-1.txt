A brother, William Arnold, left at
once for Chicago and Kalamazoo, to
bring home his brother's remains.
The accident in which Mr. Arnold
lost his life was a fearful one in

eight injured. Young Arnold- left
this city last spring to go into au
tomobile races as mechanician for
the Stutz racing car which was one
of the eleven cars which piled up
on the racing track at Kalamazoo.
A dispatch gives the following ac
count of the accident:

cock's car struck the fence, swerv
ing lengthwise across the track and
tipped over on its side. Track offi
cials made a desperate attempt to
flag the thirteen cars which were
thundering up from behind, but
without success.
Burt's Stutz was the first to
strike the wrecked Sunbeam. Then
nine other cars piled, one after
another, in the smoking death heap.
Four of the cars were far enough
in the rear to avoid smashing into
the wreckage.
Track officials started for the "mass
of wreckage, and at the same time
the crowds made a rush from the
'grandstand. When the first reached
the scene, Arnold's headless body
was found beneath the battered
Stutz. It was not until the wreck
ago had almost been completely
clcared away that his head was
found.
Today's accldcnt is the worst that
has occurred at Recreation Park
since 1911, when Lee Oldfield's rac
ing car plowed through the fence
and killed eight persons.

Now listen to this one: "Explain

most unreasonable one of all of
them. It is not probable that one
teacher out of a hundred has ever
been in a prison and they are not in

Hundreds of people in this city as

one of the most magnificent dis

night ever viewed this far south.
No colors, such as the rainbow col

the north, were visible from this
point, but the strong white lights
stretching ovpr the northern hori

search light, to the zenith of the

-Passengers on the night trains
from the northern part of the state
were entranced by the beauty of the
display, which is seldom so bright
and clear from this part of the state
as it was Saturday evening.

He is twenty years old and re

the youngest to have received such
in the history of the school.
Mr. Glass then entered high school
and during his four years of high
school work was self supporting. Ho
also helped to support a widowed
mother. He graduated from West
Des Moines high school in 1914 and
then entered The New England Con
servatory of music at Boston, where
for the past two years he has re
ceived instruction in piano under
Alfred De Vote, the great pianist,
and theory under Louis C. Elson, the
eminent critic. Mr. Glass plays
with brilliance and ease and has
been well received wherever he has
appeared. Mr. Glass is now a self
supporting student in the New Eng
land Conservatory of music. After
finishing his four year course there
he hopes to study abroad.
Mrs. Strawthers is the daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. H. Coraley of
this city, and is well known as a
dramatic reader of unusual ability.
She has appeared before Webster
