Wilson Asks Congress
For Eight-Hour Day
Washington, Aug. 29.—President Wil
son laid the railrbad strike.situation be
fore congress today in a message to a
joint meeting. The president asked
congress to enact legislation to deal
with the situation.
Pointing out the distress and hard
ships which a nation-wide strike would
bring upon the country, the president
asked congress to empower him to draft
into the service of the United States the
very managers and men who have been
unable to adjust their' differences, so
the government may operate the rail
roads in case of military necessity.
First. He proposed that congress
enlarge the membership of the in
terstate commerce commission to
equip it to deal with larger situa
tions.
Seoond. That an eight-hour day
for all trainmen be established.
Third. That a commission ilivss
tigate the effect of the eight-hour
day.
Fourth. That the commerce com
mission investigate the increased
cost in the eight-hour da&__
-Fifth. To amenTffie arbitration
law to. prevent strikes and lock
outs while differences are being
considered.
How these recommendations are to
be worked out, the president left en
tirely in the hands of the congressmen.
Raps Beth Sides.
The committee of railway presidents
made a public statement of their posi
tion, declining to accept President Wil
son's plan and giving their reasons.
"They have thought It best," said
the president, in referring to the man
agers, -"that they should be forced to
yield, ft they must yield, -not by coun
cil, but by the suffering of the coun
try.
"While my conferences with them
were in progress, when to all outward
appearance those conferences had
come to a standstill, the representa
tives of the brotherhoods suddenly
acted and set the strike for the 4th
of September."
"But I could only propose." he add

EIGHT-HOUR DAY
HELD IMPRACTICABLE
Can Not Bs Made to Apply to Operat

out Reorganization of System and
Revision of Rates, Employers De
clare—Hold 89 Per Cent of Railroad
Employes Not Involved.
Washington, Aug. 29.—Direct nego
tiations between the railroad execu
tives and employes thru President
Wilson were practically closed today
when the executives refused to accede
to the proposal by the president and
presented to him a statement of their
position containing another argument
for arbitration.
The committee of eight presented to
President Wilson a statement which
denies the fact that the judgment of
society favors an eight-hour day and
declares that arbitration is the only
proper way of settling disputes.
The suggestion of the president that
an elght-'hour day be granted was re
jected today by the executives.
Railroad Heads -Define Poeition.
This statement to the public was is
sued by the committee of railroad
presidents:
"We are unable after the most
earnest consideration to agree with
the. proposal ot the president of
the United States, whffeh is that,:-we
accept without arbitration tlm substi
tution .of-the eight-hour day jvith all
existing practices and'^agreements.
"This is tho. main point in contro
versy and, we can not surrender it
without opportunity to be heard in
some fair form of arbitration.
"We do not assent to the statement
that the eight-hour day has the sanc
tion of society in its favor.' We be
lieve that society has not yet recorded
its judgment on this subject.
Eight-Hour Day Impracticable:
"We -are not in this controversy
dealing with conditions relating to the
eight-hour day in the industrial world.
The difference' between {he eight-hour
day in the business world and manu
facturing interests and in the train
service has been fully explained. The
railroad day is a basis for computing
pay and overtime, the length of daily
service being controlled by variable
conditions.
"The demands Involved in this con
troversy have not. been presented in
our judgment for the purpose of fixing
a definite daily period of labor nor a
reduction in the existing hours of la
bor or change in methods of, operation,
but for the real purpose of accepting
an Increase of wages approximating
$100,000,000 per annum, or S5 per Cent
for the men in railroad freight train
and yard service presented by the labor
organizations in this matter.
Surrender Impossible.
"After careful examination of the
facts and patient and continuous con
sultation with the conference commlt
te and the managers and among our
oelves we have reached a clear un
derstanding as to the magnitude of the
question and the seriousness, of the
controversy

Increase of $60,000,000 Annually.
The statement declares that the!
eight-hour day without punitive-over-i
time Involves an annual increase of
160,000,000 and an increase of 20 per
cent in the pay of men, already the
most highly paid in the transportation
service. Arbitration of the question Is
insisted upon and a counter propofal
provides, as a basis, of settlement, that,
effective Sept. 1, the companies will
keep the time of the men on an eight
hour basis, separately, for the purpose
of comparison.
Brotherhoods Oppose Canadian Aot.
The brotherhood heads, Garretson,
Stone, Lee and Carter, issued the fol
lowing statement, explaining their op
position to any legislation along th*
plan of the Canadian commission:

OflTd&l uftn6Uncement that the great

next Monday at 7 a. m. is contained
in the orders given to each of the 640
district chairmen of the four train
men's brotherhoods to be* signed and
distributed to the local chairmen of
each diptrict. Most of the orders are
still .sealed,, for each chairman was in

Thus it includes the great number of
nonunion men who, without any pen

having the brotherhoods fight for them.
..Text of the Order.
The order follows:

will understand that they are

The "Sept: 4" was inserted with rub

following regulations for all strikers:
1. No man in road service involved
in the strike, will perform any servicc
after the hour set to strike, -unless he
has already begun his trip and has
actually left the terminal. If the train
has left the tet-minal he will complete
the trip, after which he will perform
no further service until the-, close of
the strike. S/ far as your legal right
to strike is,-concerned, there is no dif
ferent between a mail train and a
freight train. You have identically the
same right to refuse to perform serv

BIG DEAL IN BALL PLAYERS.
Zimmerman Traded to Giants For
Larry Doyle and Two Others,
Chicago, Aug. 29.—The most inter
esting deal of the 1916 baseball season,
or for years for that matter, was
swung last night between the Cubs
and the New York Giants. The deal
Involves the transfer of Heinle Zim
merman, the recalcitrant inflelder, to
the Giants in return for Larry Doyle,
Hunter, an inflelder and Jacobson. an
outfielder.
Because of the fact that both Doyle
and Zimmerman are two of the widest
known players in the National League
at present, the deal is easily the fea
ture of the 1916 season. In fact, from
the Chicago fans' standpoint It can be
ranked as one of' the most Important
transfers negotiated in the parent
body since the modern era of the game
under the national commission.
The actual transfer is the culmina
tion of various rumors and reports
which have been circulated along the
baseball beat-for the .last fortnight,
or
t'o be exact, since President Weeghman
of the Cubs imposed a ten-day sus
pension on Heine Zimmerman foA "lay

ians'—Paris Informed It Will Not,
Berlin, Aug. 29.—iMilitary writers In
reviewing the event of Roumania
entering the war generally agree the
new combatant will be able to throw
400,000 effectives Into the field. They
estimate she has ammunition sufficient
for not more than four or five weeks,
except for arrangements which may
have been' made for bringing in large
additioual amounts thru Russia.
Military commentators axree to the
absolute necessity ot carrying the war
into the country of Germany's new
enemy by means of swift movements
against the Roumanian flanks. In
event of swift and successful invasion
Roumania's vast stores of grain and
rich oil wells wquld be accessible to the
central powers.
Indications are that the difficult na
ture of the ground along the Hungar
ian mountain border will localize the
first clashes.
The general strategic situation makes
it possible for the troops of the cen
tral powers to assume the defensive,
leaving larger masses free to attempt
invasion at selected points.
Looks for Bulgar Aggression,
Bulgaria undoubtedly will follow the
lead of, Germany in. declaring war on

Commenting on the action of Rou

"It may be assumed with certainty
that Germany and her allies had count
ed upon Roumania's participation in
the war. In view of the geographical
situation the presumption Is permis
sible that military operations are im
minent. Allied Bulgaria undoubtedly
will declare War on Roumania. The
allies will meet the new enemy who
was once befriended by the central
powers, with whom he even had a
treatj of alliance,, and who, after two
years of purposeful waiting and de
ception. now enters the camp of our
enemies and draws his sword for the
simple reason he believes the moment
has come to take booty."

Excitement.

Berlin, Aug. 9.—The people of Berlin
received with remarkable calmness and
resignation the announcement of Rou
mania's declaration of war against
Austria-Hungary and the government's
step in redalllng the German minister
from Buoharest.
The situation was discussed with tbe
feeling that one more or less makes bo
difference,
The announcement that Roumanian
had been taken prisoner was greeted
with general satisfaction, some of tbe
papers pointing out that the central
powers were not sleeping.
Minister Missing.
Meanwhile Berlin has a little Rouma
nian mystery of its own. Thus far It
has been impossible to locate Dr. Belgl
man, the Roumanian minister. It was
stated yesterday that he was at his
home in a watering place, but inquiry
showed that he was not there and had
not been there. At the Roumanian le
gation it was stated that the minister
would bo in evidence today. Since early
morning the legation and consulate
have been, besieged by Roumanians of
Berlin to -whom the declaration of war
came like a bomb out of a dear sky*
Roumanians crowding the legation
spoke bitterly ot. their goveramont lor
thus leaving them in the dark, hut real*
Ized this was done to conceal the inten
tion of their government.
So far no 111 word is published In the
Gorman presA concerning the Rouma
nian monarch, to wfiom some paper*

Aug. 29.—Tho causcs which led Rou
mania to declare war are set forth In a
note presented to Count Czerin, tho
Austro-Hungarian minister to Rouma
nia, after a meeting of the crown coun
cil at which it was decided to doclare
war. Tho reasons given arc:
The triple alliance, to which Rouma
nia was a party, was broken when
Italy declared war ugainst Austria
Hungary.
Austria-Hungary threatened tho two
nations.
Roumania desired to hasten the end
of tho war, safeguard her racial Inter
ests realise her n»tipnnJ unity.
The note, after defining the purposes
of the triple alliance as constituted prior
to the war, and after declaring that this
alliance no longer existed aftor Italy
declared war on Austria-Hungary,
reads as follows:
"Roumania remained In the peace
state, to conserve tho situation de facto
and de Jure, created by treaties. Rou
mania then found herself in the pres
ence of powers making war for the sole
purpose of transforming the old ar
rangements which had served as the
basis for their treaties and alliances
These changes were for Roumania's
proof that tho object she pursued In
joining the triple alliance could n?
longer bo obtained, and that sho might
direct her course In new paths. Conse
quentiy Roumania resumed hor liberty
of action.

inspired by a spirit of conquest or ter

not been realized.
"Today we are confronted By a situa
