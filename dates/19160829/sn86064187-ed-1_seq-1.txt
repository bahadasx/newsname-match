CORNELIUS RAPS
MORROW'S ADVICE
AS TO FINANCES
Only $200,000 County Funds
on Hand, He Asserts.
MUCH CANNOT BE USED
Detailed Statement Made by
Excise Board Member,
(muit Assessor Morrow's statement
that the tax rate in Oklahoma county
is needlessly high, and that thr rr-ci-c
hoard should list- a pari ot a lull
millioil dollar siirdus lo lower taxes,
was branded incorrect and impossible
by fiiunty Clerk Cornelius and other
comity of final today. Morrow said
thr ronntv had a surplus of betwrrn
$5(K).iHKI and ViUi.OOO, which is draw
ing only 2' i permit interest for
nelius answers that the county has not
that sui4lus.
"Instrljl of $iK),lKil surplus." Cor
nelius said, "there was in reality only
S22H,fi2J.)9 mi June .HI. the end of the
fiscal year. On August 2fj thrre was
only $ 1 11,27 4 invested in outstanding
warrants aud bonds, leaving a rash
wnrkitW balance of rountv money on
hand of only S99..T4K. which is not any
loo much, considering that considerably
over one-half of last year's taxes have
been paid and spent, and that taxes for
this year will not commence to be rol
lerted litnil about February I. II7"
Kir. Cornelius ilatemrnt follows:
Cornelius' Statement.
"Total of bond and judgments out
standing against the county is $400,
.KW.5u; under the law we should have
on hand in the sinking fund at that
time to meet accrued liability, $197,
840.20; however, it such time there
was rash in the sinking fond, $IH9,
loV.4.1; leaving a cash deficit of $8.
67o.fU. In other words, instead of hav
ing too much money jm band in (bat
fund, w had W.u?6o less than the
law requires ui to accumulate. The
only money which the county owes and
Ita a right to use are the following
cash items in the following funds, Au

Money on Hand.
"So instead of $oOO,0iO on hand be
longing to the county, there is in real
ity only the sum of these two items, or
$228.fi2.1(K). And on August 2t. I9lfi,
we had. of this sum. $129.274 74 in
vested in outstanding county warrants,
and bonds, leaving a cash working bal
ance of county money on hand of only

considering that considerably over one
half of last years' taxes have been paid
and spent, and that taxes for this year
will not commence to be collected tin

President Wiltoa appeared before

tude of the men, I considered it my
duty to confer with representatives of
both the railroads and brotherhoods,
and myself offer mediation, not as an
arbiter, but merely as a spokesman of
the nation, in the interest of justice, in'
deed, and as a friend of both parties,
hut not as a judge, only as the repre- o

rens of the United Slates looking be

spuiisihrliry which the public would put
upon them.
Approves Eight-Hour Day.
"It seemed to me, in considering the;
subject matter of the lontroversy. that
the whole spirit of the time and tht
preponderant evidence of recesst econ
omy exierieiue spoke for t)ie eight
hour day. It had been adiudged by the
thought and experience of recent yeari
a thing upon whuh society is justified
in insisting as in the tutetest (if health,
efficiency, contentment aud a general
increase of Ihe interest of economic
vigor The whole presumption of mod
cm cxprrirmc would, it seemed to me,
be in its favor, whether there was ar
bitration air not aud the debatable
points to settle were those which rosn
out of the arrctpanre of the right hour
day rather than those which affected ill
establishment.
Proposed Adoption.
"I, therefore, proposed that the eight
hour day br adopted by the railway
managements and put into practice (or
the prrsenl as a substitute for the ex
i-ting ten hour basis of jiav and serv -ice;
that I should appoint, with the
pcimission of the congress, a small
commission to observe the results of the
ihange, carefully studying the figures
of ihe altered operating costs, not only,
, Put also the conditions of labor under
whuh thr turn worked and the open
tion of their existing agreements witlt
the railroads, with institutions to re
port the facts as they found them to
the congress at the earliest possible
lay. but without recommendation ; and
that after the farts had lecn thus dis
closed, and adjustments should in some
orderly manner be sought of all the
matters now left unadiiistrd between
the railroad managers ami the men.
"These proposals were exactly in line,
it is imrresiitig to note, with the msi
tion taken by the supicme court of the
United Slates when appealed to pro
tect certain litigants from the financial
losses which they conlid-ntly expected
if they submit to the regulation of their
charges and of their methods of their
