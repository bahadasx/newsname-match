PASTOR KNOWLES PRESENTS
RESIGNATION LAST NIGHT.
Harry G. Knowles, for flvo years
past pastor of tho Christian church,
presented his resignation to the boatd
of trustees nt a mooting last night.
Tho resignation takes effect January
first. Mr. Knowles resigns in order
to engage in the national evangelical
work, and while itheso duties will car
ry him to many "parts of tho country,
ho will have his headquarters In Lin
coln. His first work In this Hno will
bo In California shortly after tho first
of January.
Under, tho pastorate of Mr. Knowles
the gifowth of 'the Christian church
has been phenomenal. When he came
hero five years ago tho membership
was 110; today it is 530. Not only Is
Mr. Knowles a strong pulpit orator,
but ho is a wjondcrful organizer; an
pnogctic worker who apparently never
tiros. Not only has he proven a hu
man dynamjet. in his church work but
he has been a booster for all things
which are for -tho moral, intellectual
and commercial good of North Plntto.
It was with regret that Mr. Knowles
"presented his resignation, but in his
nqw position his field is broader, nii
opdsgrtunity for greater work Is given
him, and incidentally ho receives a
flattering increase In salary.
Tho Tribune In common with overy
citizen who knows Harry G. Knowles
truo worth. Blnceroly regrets that he
has tendered his troslgnation.
