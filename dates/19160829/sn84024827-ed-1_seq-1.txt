(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINCTON, Aug. 28.
President Wilson tnight defi
nitely decided to go before con
gress in person tomorrow or Wed
nesday to recommend legislation
aimed o avert the threatened
nation-wide railroad strike, or
stop it if it comes before con
gress can act.
He worked until late tonight on his
message in which he will lell mem
bers of the Senate and House the ne
gotiations to date and lay before them
a definite legislative program .
The President reached this decis
ion after conferences at the White
House with the committee of eight
railroad presidents and the four
brotherhood heads on a new proposal
for settlement of differences suggest
ed by the executives and after pro
longed discussion of the situation at
the capitol with the members of the
Democratic steering committee of the
Senate .
All Proposals Doomed ,
The proposition of the railroad
executives was that an investigation
of all issues be conducted by a com
mission to be named by the President
the investigation to last for a period
of three or four months, no action to
be taken by either side in the mean
time and at the conclusion of the in
quiry the situation to be what it now
is, the employes having the choice
either of arbitrating or striking. The
brotherhood heads promised a reply
tomorrow and there was every indi
cation it would be unfavorable.
Can't Recall Strike
When the railroad brotherhoods
heads went to the White House to
night the President strongly urged
the withdrawal of a tentative strike
order sent out yesterday, subject to
release calling for a walk out of the
400,000 brotherhood members at 7 a.
m.. Labor Day, September 4. This re
quest was flatly refused, the leaders
saying only the committee of 640,
which left Washington yesterday, had
power to recall the order.
Copies of the strike order were
brought to the Presidents attention
after they had gotten into the pos
session of the railroad executives. It
had been known that the members of
the committee of 640 carried home
with them a tentative order but no
one outside the brotherhood councils
had suspected that a date had been
set and the President is said to have
been greatly perturbed by the infor
mation. After the refusal to with
draw the order, he communicated
with the railroad presidents who held
a meeting that lasted until late In the
night.
In spite of the npparent final fail
ure of his efforts to bring the two
sides together the President was rep
resented tonight as being still hope
ful of avoiding a strike.
Wilson To Act Today
The legislative program pre
pared for congress includes the
following measure:
An eight hour day law for rail
rrfid employes so framed as to
give the railroads time to prepare
for it; and
A law patterned after the Can
adian industrial disputes act pro
viding for investigation of indus
trial disputes on railroads by a
commission and prohibiting all
strikes or lockouts pending the
outcome of the investigation.
Provides Mr U. S. Control
In addition to these measures there
are under consideration a resolution
to increase the revenue of the rail
roads in case the expenses are in

Navy War Game Proves
Need of Aeroplanes
(By Review
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2S Comment
ing today on the big naval war game
played last week. Rear Admiral Ren
son, chief of operations, said the vital
lesson demonstrated was the need of
ships for scouting purposes and also
the urgent necessity of adding battle
and scout cruisers to the fleet.
Although the aeroplane ship North
Carolina participated in the game as
a scout, none of her hydroplanes was
regarded as safe for use. Admiral
Rens'.m said the profit of finding the
best type of pontoon for the machines,
minimizing the danger of landing was
given attention by navy expert an I
the results were to be expected soon.

The department is still without in
formation as to the part played in the
game by Rear Admiral Helm's sub
marine fleet. Admiral Bens.n declared,
however, that when the department's
plans for establishing submarine
bases along both coasts, with a fleet
of submarines stationed at each, such
a result as the red fleet under Ad
miral Mayo theoretically accomplished
would be impossible.

It is impossible this year to attempt

tive Doremus, chairman of the con

tee heads asked for more speakers for
Maine, but speaker Clark rVniinded
them that it was essential to main'
tain a quorum of the House to insure
action on important bills to be en
acted before adjournment.
Representative Williams of Illinois
proposed the need of more Democrat
ic literature for the German-American
newspaper readers.
Mr. McCormick said that the great
est problem that confronted the par
ty was getting its case before the pub
lie as war and international affairs
had crowded the campaign off the
front pages of the newspapers.
He had planned to have a rousing
Democratic campaign in Maine and
then activity elsewhere, and not wast
ing ammunition on certain districts.
Mr. Cummings told the conferees
there were states in which the Demo
crats had a right to expect victory,
but which a few years ago were hope
less. He said reports from Maine
were so encouraging as to be almost
too astonishing to believe.
He asked that 12 or 15 representa
tives volunteer to add to the speak
ers scheduled for Maine.
Speaker Clark, who recently return
ed from Maine, reported that the au
diences there instead of being "cold"
were most appreciative.

day night. August 27. by declaring war on Austria and straightway hurling
her magnificent army of more than half a million soldiers against her new

Austrian lines simultaneously on the eastern and western frontier passes of
Hungary. Her attacks were described as treacherous, but in each case wer
repulsed, and according to Austria, many Rumanian prisoners were taken.
The Kntente bailed the entrance of Rumania as of the greatest signifi
cance and in many quarters it was regarded as opening the way to a final
severance of the Dardenelles, as well as providing a new gateway Into the
heart of Austria.
Grecian officials also were prone to look more kindly upon the Allies
cause, and there is reason to believe her military is getting ready to follow
