The new plan of servlcea started in
the Christian Church Sunday morning
seem to be a success. By this method
of combining the Sunday School and
the Church services, all the members
of the School are given the benefit of
! both services. The communion ser
vice which is always given a promi
nent place In the services of this
church. Is made the devotional part of
the combined aervice, and the teaching
of the leaaon in this connection makes
the Bible School a Church-achool as It
should properly be. There were some
few who not knowing of the change In
the time of the church services came
Jn at the close of the sermon, to theao
the announcement waa again made
that the time of the church services
was from ten to eleven o'clock. This
new arrangement of time will last
through this month of September and
Jonger if the plan continues to meet
with favor.

PRESIDENT WILSON
T tie Before t'onaresa Today To Seel.
I i'g Kbit Imi To Awt Railroad
Strike Withdrawal of Tenia-Hi.-
Orders To Walk Out
la Refuted by Men.
WHO lioi lis ITI
Washington, August 28 President
Wilson tonight definitely decided to go
before Congress In person tomorrow or
Wednesday to recommend legislation
aimed to avert the threatened nation
wide railroad strike or to stop It, If It
comes before Congress can act. He
worked until late tonight on his mes
sage in which he will tell members of
the Senate and House the negotiations
to date and lay before them a definite
legislative program.
The President reached this de
cision after conferences at the White
HouBe with the committee of eight
railroad presidents and the four
brotherhood heads on a new pro
posal for settlement of differences,
suggested by the executive, and after
a prolonged diacusslon of the situa
tion at the Capitol, with the mem
bers of the Democratic steering com
mittee of the Senate. The proposition
of tho railroad executives waB that
an Investigation of all Issues be con
ducted by a commission to be named
by the President, the investigation to
last for a period of three or four
months, no action to be taken by either
side In the meantime and at the con
clusion of the Inquiry the situation to
be what it now is, the. employes having
tho choice of either arbitrating or
striking. The brotherhood heads prom
ised a reply tomorrow morning and
there was every Indication It would be
unfavorable.
Withdrawn! of Strike Order I rged
When the railroad brotherhoods
heads went to the White House to
night, the President not only laid be
fore thorn the plan of the executives,
but strongly urged the withdrawal
of a tentative strike order sent out
yesterday, subject to release, calling
for a walkout of the 400,000 brother
hood members at 7 o'clock tho morn
ing of Labor Duy, September 4. This
request whb flatly refused the leaders
saying only the committee of t!40,
which left Washington yesterday had
power to recall the order.
Copies of the strike order were
brought to the President's attention
after they had gotten Into the pos
session of the railroad executives. It
had been known that the members
of the committee of 640 carried home
with them a tentative order, but no
one outside the brotherhood counsel
had suspected that a date had been
set and the President is said to have
been perturbed by the Information.
After the refusal to withdraw the or
der he communicated with the ratiroai
Presidents, who held a meeting that
lasted until late in the night. Inspite of
tho apparent final failure' of his efforts
to bring the two sides together, the
President was represented tonight as
still being hopeful of averting a strike
0 Legislative Program Mapped Out
The legislative program prepared
for Congress includes the following
measures:
An eight-hour day law for railroad
employes so framed as to give the
railroads time to prepare for it; and
A law patterned after the Canadian
industrial dispute act providing for
investigation of industrial disputes
on railroadB by a commission and
prohibiting strikes or lockouts pend
ing the outcome of the investigation.
In addition to those measures that
are under consideration, a resolution
to increase the revenues of the rail
roads in case the expenses are in
creased and a law creating authority
for the operation of the railroads ua
Vh the Federal Government In the
event of a strike. The plan tonight
was to have the first two measures
introduced as amendments to tho bill,
which has already passed the House,
Increasing the Interstate Commerce
f oinuilttHion from seven to nine mem
bers.
I'realdent Is Determined
Although on the surface a nation
wide railroad strike was nearer to
night than It had over been, con
fidence was expressed in official quar
ters that the step uader contemplation
would have the effect of preventing a
walkout. The President realising the
disaster which would come to the
country if the railroads are tied up,
was said to be determined to prevent
a strike at any cost. In bis confer
ences with the executives he strongly
urged that they change their hitherto
unyielding attitude and when he saw
the employes ho declared that all nug
gestlona from the executives ahould
be given most careful consideration
Final urruugomeuta for the appear
aiioe of the President U-t.no Congruaa
were not completed tonight, bui he
discussed the question fully with the
Democratic steering committee til tin
.s 1, aie aud they agreed with hliu Ibat
he should address a Joint session. The
time of his appearance depends largely
upon further oonXarau.ce Loa 1
