WASHINGTON. August 2!).?Direct
negotiations between the railroad
executives and the employes through L
President Wilson were practically
closed today when the executives re-1 ,
fused to accede to a proposal made to, (
them yesterday by .Mr. Wilson and, ,
presented to him a statement of their'
position containing another argument! .
for arbitration.
The statement presented to Prcsl-1 !
Sent Wilson by the committee of eight
denies that the judgment of society'
favors an eight-hour day and declared;
lhat arbitration is the only proper
way of settling industrial disputes. The ,
suggestion of President Wilson for a
proposal including the principle of
the eight-hour day. hut postponing its (
effectiveness for a year, pending in-;
vestigatlon. was rejected hv the railroad
executives at the conference tills
morning. The action of the railroad |.
presidents taken in connection with
the strike order of tlie employes left .
President Wilson no alternative but to
go to Congress ip a final effort Ifji
overt the strike by legislation.

(Washington! AuR."29.--whiiei
President Wilson was announcing
that he would lay the railway strike
situation before Congress at. 2:30; '
o'clock today, the brotherhood lead- '
?rs rejected the latest proposition ot
:he committee of railway presidentsj
nnd actually ordered the strike to I
begin at 7 a, 111. Labor day, unless a
settlement satisfactory to them Is
reached In the meantime.
Their previous order for the!
strike was tentative and required a
secret signal to put it Into effect. IlnIleas
a settlement satisfactory to the
labor leaders Is reached before that
time or unless President Wilson and
Congress And some wav to prevent It
the strike would start Labor daywithout
further notice.
Anticipate Legal Process.
The labor leaders admittedly took
their action the first thing today in i
the belief that some means was being
sought to prevent the strike actually
being called. By their action they
think they have anticipated any legal I
processes which might be brought
against (hem.
President Wilson announced Ills -.
decision to address Congress in joint,
session at 2:3(1 o'clock soon after
,io,.toinn of the labor leaders be
LliO UVV1UIVM
I came known.
I Arrangements were made at the ,
I Capitol for House and Senatt to asI
semble In the hull of the House to ,
I hear the president propose the leglsI
latlon which has been agreed upon
ay tho administration leaders.
I Shortly after 10:30 o'clock a telephone
call came to the White House)
from the railroad executives to the, ,
effect that the committee of eight!
would like to see President Wilson, ; (
Ho had engagements up until I,
I o'clock, but informed the executivi
I he would see them if possible.
I Postpones Cabinet Meeting.
I Later the president sent word to
the executives that he would see them
I at 11 o'clock, and postponed his
cabinet meeting to do so.
I The developments early in the day
advanced the situation to the most
serious phase it has assumed.
Will Oppose Compulsion.
I Brotherhood leaders, it was underI
stood today, will light the compulsory <
I investigation feature of President 1
I Wilson's legislative program, but t
support his eight-hour proposal. 1
Every effort will be made (o get <
separate votes on tho proposition 111 i
Congress, and leaders were confident '
that could be done. A. If. Garrett- !
son, spokesman for the men. ox-11
pressed himself as strongly opposed t
to the compulsory investigation plan,;'
I and while he did not entirely ap-1
I prove of the proposed eight-hour hill. 1
I he said that it would bring benefits)
1 to such numbers of non-union men !
B that the railroads doubtless would '
W oppose It, and he tbought the brother- '
| hoods would be behind it.
I I'litn is to Throttle. ) 1
I "Tho Canadian compulsory investl- J
gation plan," ho said, "has provea ,
the greatest throttle to labor that '
ever has boon devisod. Invariably, ]
and I speak from experience in deal-,,
Ins with railways, the railroad heads ,
have used this delay, guaranteed by,,
law, to prepare for a strike.
"The eight-hour day proposal, fall-1
ing to earry as It will, of course, any
reference to wages, would not otu-j
brace our present demands and not!,
be wholly satisfactory to us. It ,
would hnve the effect, however,, of J
bringing the unorganized eighty per ,
cent of railway labor, of which tho,,
railway heads spoak so feelingly, ander
an eight-hour day. It would hoi,
a step In the right direction and I,,
think you would find the railroads,;
opposing It. vigorously." , J

+
Instructors Ably Present Help-1
ful Lessons and the Interest
Therein is Profound.
After the singing of some Bongs the
devotional was conducted by tho Itov. i
P. M. liaber, of the Central Christian
church, of thic city anil Prof, .lack-1
sou. superintendent of the city schools,I
then took up the nubjecl "The ICar
Marks of a Good Recitation" Tuesday
morning at the teachers county Institute
here. Ho pointed out that in;
the recitation tlte teacner uus a vuum 10
make or mar her success, and every ]
teacher is on a greater trial in every |
recitation than any pupil in the class.
If teachers wish to keep tlielr books
open during the recitation conduct it
In such a way that the pupils may also
keep theirs open. One of the essentials
of a good recitation Is the aim. The
teacher must manifest the spirit and i
co-operation of a friend to the class.;
She should correct mistakes so they
will leave no sting; she must have a
thorough knowledge of her subject.
Too many teachers are using teaching
simply for a stepping stone lo something
higher. Whatever may he tlie
cause of a child's failure in the recitation
the teacher must find it.
In every recitation the teacher
needs to keep in mind throe things,
she must know when she Is "testing,"
"drilling" and "teaching." Almost one- ;
third of the child's time Is wasted because
he does not know how to study.)
He showed that we need lo use both
the test and drill but there Is great
danger (hat too much time may he
spent on these two and too little real
teaching. Give more opportunity for)
the pupils to express themselves. The
.. ww.tfutMn In not what
H'fSL ?I1 tt 5UUU I w v* * c#
the teacher can say so much as what
the pupils themselves can say and do. J
The teacher should not disturb the
pupil while he la reciting, should
avoid repeating the answer of the.
pupil. The teacher assumes too much1
responsibility for flic success of the
recitation. The interest manifested by
the pupils at the close of the recltntion.
such as some problem to he
solved or a desire in the children to.
go on and find out more is one of the
best Indieations of a good recitation. !
Inventory Discussed.
After n solo by J. Hansel Domino
Dr. I!. C. llinnicb took up the subject,
'An Educational Inventory." He spent]
his time 011 the phase nf this subjectj
entitled "The General Object of Education."
In the first place he said thut
we were struggling to get away from
11 narrow way of thinking into a
broader socialism. The tendency of
our liberal education has been to drag j
us away from anything practical. The I
child must have good health and]
enough education to make a living.
This is the condition we must seek
to ohtaln In America. The school ]
should strive to havo good Ideals In
music, literature and art. He pointed
out that the community should expect
11 return on every dollar it expends for
education, and this has to be paid by
(he ones educated.
His last point was relating to "Enfaltering
Americanism." He said the
looseness of paiiotLsm and loyalty of
the people Is very great. It Is one of I
the duties of the school to make unfaltering
Americans of our boys and
girls.
After He cess.
After a ten minute intermission,
F'rof. llamtan reau an ezcuiem imi? < i
jntitled "A Stoiy of Achievement."
[n this paper were related the
Achievements of a community
brought about by the citizens of tho
community through the leadership of
Its teachers and district supervisory
1'he community center meeting
played a very great part in this,
story. After reading the story he i
isked the teachers to /less whether|
it was a true story or not. and Anally
told them that it was a true story
ol progress made In Church district,
Wetzel county, this state. As a last I
remark he said: "We can not go;
very lar with any of this progress
without tho people are with us."
Prof. Meyers, of Marshall College,
made a few remarks relative to the
progress and Improvements being
made in the school which he represents,
and then be made a few more
remarks to impress upsn the toaeh
ers the groat importance or m?"
teacher having a creed of his own,
written out and revised from time
to time. He left several points
worthy of thinking about.
