UTILITIES COMMISSION THREATENS TO DISFRANCHISE
If the public utilities commission does not hear within a reasonable
time from Robert Bond, president of the Island Electric Company, who
has been directed to explain the corporation's financial pecularities, the
commission will possibly order the company disfranchised. This angle
developed at the commission's weekly meeting this afternoon.
"The Island Electric Company's rates are too high,- said Chairman
Charles R. Forbes. "It charges 20 cents" a kilowatt, w here Waimea, a
smaller concern, only charges 15, and Lahaina Ice Company will soon re
duce its rate from 15 cents to 10. Unless Bond can convince us other
wise, we should take steps to compel tae company to reduce its lighting
rates in Walluku and Kahului to a reasonable figure."
The commission adjourned to 2:45 out of respect to the memory of
the late Hugh M. Coke, brother of James U Coke, attorney for the com
mission. Hugh Coke was killed by lightning at his California ranch.
