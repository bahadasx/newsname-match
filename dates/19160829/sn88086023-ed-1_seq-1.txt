ASTORIA, Aug. 2. (Special)--The
Morning Astorian says editorially
today
"Hail to Muriel. Queen of the twent
first Astoria regatta, and hail to the
live city of Pendleton In which she'
tesldes. To use a rather unattractive. I
but Verj expressive phrase, there'll be .
a big time when Pendleton and Port- j

GIVE
HIM 1
THEIR COUNTER PROPOSAL
to the other distresses of
period." He exptarned his
tbe
position in the controversy an a
friend of both parties. A repre
sentatite of one hundred million
men. women and children who
would pay the Incalculable
price."
He advocated the eight hour
day and said : --The eight hour day
is judged by the thought and ex
perience of recent years as the
thing upon which society is jus
tified in insisting on in the inter
ests of health, efficiency, content
ment and the general IniTeuHe of
economic vigor. The whole pre
sumption of modern experience
favors It."
He declared the trainmen rep
resentatives had aixvpted his plan
but the railway reprcsen tati ren
had rejected it.
RAILROADS CRITICIZED.
Reg an ting the railroads Wtm
said: -They feel the hostile In
fluence of -hipiMMs, who would
oppose the increased freight rates
caused by readjustment. They
apparently feel no confidence In
tne interstate commerce commis
sion. They don't care to rely on
the friendly aswirunces of con
smvs or the president. They have
thought it MM that they should
be forced to yield If they must
yield not by counsel, hut by the
suffering of ghe country." He
severely criticized the railroads
saying: "The railway managers
rejected my counsel feeling they
must, at any cost, stand for the
arbitration which the men re
jected. To stand firm for arbi
tration and yet not get arbitra
tion, seemed to me futile, and
something- more than futile, it In
volves Incalculable distress upon
the country and (consequences In
some respects worse than war
