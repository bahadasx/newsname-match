Little Important Fighting.
Except in the Macedonian sector,
little important fighting is reported
from the front. Along the line where
the Teutonic Allies are in contact
with the Serbians, British and
French, Berlin and Paris report addi­
tional gains for their respective
forces. iBerlin records the capture
of heights south of Zbrosko by the
Bulgarians, and the repulse of Serb­
ian ccounter attacks on .Mount Se
ganska, where, Paris says, the Serbs
have made, considerable progress
near Vetrinike, a,nd have repulsed
with heavy .losses Bulgarian attacks
on the roads-from 'Banica to Ostrovo.
Paris admits, Tiowever, Bulgarian oc­
cupation of positions abandoned by
the Greeks west of Kavala, on the
Aegean.
Prench iMake Progress.
Artillery engagements and opera­
tions again have characterized the
fighting in France and Belgium. The
French report further progress west
of Delville wood and near the Mo
quette farm, -in the Somme region,
while London reports the shelling of
British positions, especiallly between
Pozieres and the Thiepval wood, and
reciprocal bombardment at other
.points. A German attack near 'Fleu
dy failed.
From the Riga region to the Car­
pathian passes there have been iso­
lated engagements at various points
between the (Russians and the Austro
Germans, but no notable successes.
Hard fighting is in progress between
the Russians and Turks in the Lake
Van region and north of Bitlis. In
the latter region the Turks have been
driven 'back by a Russian counter at­
tack, losing men and guns.
Aside from bombardments by the
Austrians along the Isonzo front, the
situation in the Austro-Italian the­
atre remains unchanged.

London, Aug. 28.—Roumania has
thrown in her lot with the Entente
Allies, by declaring war on Austria-1
Hungary and almost simultaneously
Germany has announced that she Is
at war with Roumania.
Already the troops of King Ferdi­
nand are seeking entry into the plains
of Transylvania, through the eastern
Carpathians, toward Kronstadt, the
chief city ih Transylvania, and in the
direction of Hermannstadt, evidently
in an endeavor to press northward
through Transylvania toward Buko
wina and GallcJa borders, and to take
ithe re&r' the *rj£
lng to hold back the Russians from
entering the Plains of Hungary.
Nothing has come through to indi­
cate what preparations have 'been
made .by' the (Bulgarians to offse a
probable' attack by the Roumanians
along the Danube front, or possible
attempts by the Russians at invasion
by means of the Danube and through'
Dobruja, or by th'd -Black Sea. It is
estimated that Roumania will be able
to throw nearly 800,000 men into the
field.

When European Struggle.
Widens Abruptly.
THREATENED STRIKE
ADDS TO EXCITEMENT
Chicago, Aug. 25.-^Abrupt widening
of the European war zone today sent
wheat values tumbling almost as if
the market had no 'bottom. The ex­
treme fall in prices was eleven and
one-fourth cents, an amount virtually
a parallel to the extrordinary rise wit­
nessed two years ago on the day that
hostilities began. Transactions today
as then were on a huge scale, measur­
ed only millions of bushels.
It was the view that the end of the
•war had perhaps been greatly hasten­
ed which, in the main, brought about
today's big drop in quotations. Even
the most conservative traders serious­
ly discussed the chance that by a
speedy opening of the Dardanelles
vast stores of Russian grain would
soon reach western Europe as a result
of Roumania having at last joined for­
tunes with the Anglo-French allies.
Roumania's declaration of war was
generally coupled with the prospect
that Italy was about to participate
actively with the new recruit in a
fresh effort to force the Dardanelles.
Word late in the session that actual
fighting already had commenced on
the Roumanian frontier, set the wheat
pit here nearly frantic and was follow­
ed by a wild close at the lowest prices
of the day, $1.40%. to $1.40% for Sep­
tember, and $1.43% to $1.44% for De­
cember as against Saturday's finish
of respectively $1.51% and $1.53%: to
$1.54.
Throughout the day, and especial­
ly during the late dealings, the in­
creased chances of a general railway
strike in the United States added to
the excitement of wheat traders, and
formed a perceptible fatcor in bring­
ing about the collapse of the market.

The university authorities give Mr.

LITTLE OPPOSITION
The Citizens' Paving Committee
last evening issued the following re
quest to the property owners of Bis­
marck:
"This committee believes it to
the best interest of property own
ers that the selection of paving
material be deferred until this com
mittee in conjunction with the City
Commission Paving Committee can
investigate the merits of the various
kinds of paving materials. Therefore,
we suggest that should property own
ers be asked to sign petitions for pav
ing materials that thev do not do so
!without conferring with some of the,
members of this committee.

city commission and September 11
was set as the time for the awarding
of the contracts. The members of
the city commission are going to give
the property owners plenty of time
to canvass the situation, and to under­
stand costs and materials. It is hoped
that 15 or more blocks in the busi­
ness district can be completed before
snow falls, but no work in the resi­
dence district can toe started before
spring. All bids call for the comple­
tion of the proposed paving Nov. 1,
1917. The business district, it was
hoped, could be completed by Nov. 1.
of this year, but this is not believed
to be feasible now.
Little Opposition.
Serious opposition to the paving
failed to materialize last evening.
The situation had been gone over so
thoroughly before the bids were call­
ed for, both by the Commercial club
special committee, the city commi
sion and the citizens' committee
The time for formal protest expired
August 20, but last evening a few
more than 100 property owners, prac­
tically all of them in the residence
district, filed formal protests.
They were represented by \R. N.
Stevens, who addressed the commis­
sion and asked that the opening of
bids be deferred until those protest­
ing were given a formal hearing. He
opposed the project on the score of
expense, quoting figures, however,
that were not 'borne out when the
bids were tabulated. Costs quoted in
each instance were excessive.
Majority Want Paving.
Mayor Lucas informed him that the
property owners would have plenty of
time to enter a protest and that they
would be thoroughly advised of each
step taken by the commission. The
commission has before them petitions
from more than 51 per cent asking
for paving.
The bids opened last evening must
lay over five days. Then the prop­
erty owners have a stated time to
express their preference for materi­
als and the commission adopts the
selection of the majority.
It has been sugggested by the cit­
izens' committee that property own­
ers do not sign any of the various
petitions that probably willl be cir­
culated without consulting with the
committee. Several members of the
city commission and representatives
from the citizens' committee will
leave today to make a special study
of pavements in Fargo, Winnipeg, Du
luth, Minneapolis, fit. Paul and Chi­
cago. Those who probably will make
the trip are: Commissioner Battey,
chairman of the city paving commit­
tee Commissioners Kirk and
'Bertsch, City Engineer Atkinson and
E. A. Hughes, chairman of the citi­
zens' paving committee.
Don't Sign Petitions.
In view of the fact that this inves­
tigation into the merits of the various
paving is made, the citizen's commit­
tee feels that It would not be a wise
policy for the property owners to
sign paving petitions circulated by
the promoters of the various paving
material companies. When a report
has been made 'by this committee of
the merits of the various pavements,

Governor Hanna Receives Letter
From H. P. McCaine, Adju­

Governor Hanna yesterday received
a letter from H. P. McCaine, adjutant
general of the war department, stat­
ing conditions under which students
now serving with the national guard
can be mustered out to complete their
studies. The letter follows:
"In response to your letter of the
16th instant relative to the discharge
of students serving in the national
guard, I beg leave to advise you as
follows:
"If the number of men asking for
discharge and the effect upon the
units of which they are members will
permit it, department commanders
will be authorized to discharge, after
September 1, 1916, individual mem­
bers of the national guard mustered

who can show a bona fide intention of
entering or returning to colleges or
schools at the beginning of the fall
