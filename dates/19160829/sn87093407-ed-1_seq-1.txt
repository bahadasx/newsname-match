OF THE HYPOCRITES
"We need a friend--we want

torwails the old standpat
organ, and on this basis it be
seeches the voters to cast their
ballots for Humphrey.
It's the same old fake that the voters
of Seattle have heard before. It's the
sham cry of the hypocrite.
Two years ago the reactionary organ
had a chance to support the right kind
of a Western Washington man for the
senate. But neither it nor any of the
other standpat papers supported the
Western Washington man. They
needed a friend then, and their friend
happened to be Wesley Jones, of
Yakima, so the whole horde of reac
tionary, boss-controlled organs com
bined and put Jones in the Senate.
They did it then as they are doing
now —not because they want a Seattle
man in the senate, or a Western Wash
ington man even—but because they
want their particular kind of man.
THEY NEED A FRIEND.

ONE CENT
Addresses Joint Session in Effort to
"Safeguard the Life and Interests
of the Nation."
BY ROBERT J. BENDER
I nlt»<l Pr«»• *»«ff • "rr»»j">nd»nt
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29. —As a dramatic climax to his unprec
edented negotiations to avert the most disastrous labor war that
ever threatened the United States, President Wilson this afternoon
appeared before a joint session of congress and urged legislation
"to safeguard the life and interest of the nation."
He said he urged the legislation, "not in haste or merely as a
means of meeting a present emergency, but as permanent and
necessary additions to the law, suggested, indeed, by circum
stances we had hoped never to see, but imperative as well as just,
if such emergencies are to be prevented in the future."
He recommended
(I) Immediate provision for the enlarge
ment and administrative organization of the
interstate commerce commission enabling the
commission to deal with the duties now de
volving upon it "with a promptness and thoro
ness which are, with its present constitution
and means of action, practically impossible."
ASKS 8-HOUR DAY ON ALL ROADS
(2) Establishment of an eight-hour day
as the legal basis alike of work and of wages
in the employment of all railroad employes en
gaged in operating trains in interstate trans
portation. The time for the institution of this
law is to be determined by congress. The
president suggested no date.
(3) Authorization of the appointment by
the president of a commission to study results
in the application of the eight-hour day to rail
road operation, alike for the men and for the
roads; the investigators to report to congress
at the earliest possible date, but without recom
mendation as to legislative action.
(4) Approval by congress of considera
tion by the interstate commerce commission
of freight rate increases to meet such addi
tional expenditures bv the roads as are
rendered necessary by adoption of the eight
hour day.
ASKS POWER TO RUN TRAINS
(5) Amendment of the federal law which
provides for the mediation, conciliation and ar
bitration of such controversies as the present
by adding a provision that in case methods of
accommodation now provided should fail, a
full public investigation shall be instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout may law
fully be attempted.
(6) Empowering the president, in case of
military necessity, to take control of such por
tions and rolling stock of the railway as may
be required for military use and to operate
them for military purposes, with authority to
draft into the military service of the country
such train crews and administrative officials
as circumstances require.
Outlinei Peace Efforta
The president outlined In detail
his efforts to effect a settlement of
the pending dispute thru friendly
negotiations Ill* efforts, he said,
had "resulted In complete dead
lock."
Now the country fares, he (aid,
a great national calamity with
• i Itle* cut off front food supplies
and the commerce of the nation
paralyzed. Countless thousands
will In all likelihood be brought. It
may be, to the very point of starva
tion."
Mediation under the existing
laws has failed, he admitted, and
arbitration has been rendered Im
possible "by the attitude of the
tn< n."
Society Back* 8-Hour Day
He said that he had offered the
eight-hour day a* a Ua*ls for
agreement because the "wholej
spirit of the time and the prepon
rlerant evidence of recent economic
experience" spoke out for It.
In the face of Indications that
the railroads would "ultimately be
obliged to accept the eight-hour
day by concerted action of organ
ized labor, "backed by the favor
able Judgment of society," they
have declined to accept tills
mean* of settlement, he said.
Road* Fear Shipper*
The railroad* fear the Influence
of hostile *hlppers and they ap
parently feel no confidence that
the Interstate commerce roramli-
OS IM4IN*
hum*,
sion could withstand the objec
tions that would he made, the
president said
"They do not care to rely upon
the friendly assurance* of con
gress or the president. They
have thought It best that they
should be forced to yield. If they
must yield, not by counsel, but by
the suffering of the country."
The president tonight at K
o'clock will go tr> the rapltol again
to confer with Speaker Clark. Rep
resentatlve Kitchin. floor leader;
Representative Mann, republican
leader In the house, and Chairman
Adainson of the house Interstate
commerce committee and will
urge early action on his proposal.
Republicans manifested opposi
tion early today and Indicated they
would need considerable time for
c'ebate. Nevertheless, administra
tion officials feel that the entire
program will go thru within 10
days.

to congress on the railroad
strike situation will he
