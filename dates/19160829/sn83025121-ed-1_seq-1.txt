(Assoetstsd Frsss a? rsdsral WtnUss)
CHICAGO, August 29. The declara
tton of war against Austria-Hungary
by Kumhniv and the declaration of war
against Rumania by Germany, smashed
the wheat market here yesterday, and
caused a general rush to sell. Prices
opened well but the news broke them
immediately and they went off five and
one half cents before the elose.
The vast stores of Bumaqian grain,
and the Rumania wheat crop exceeding
thnt of Australia last year, are now
solely at the dispoaal of the Entente Al
lies, who have been forced in the paxt
to depend almost exclusively upon the
grain shipped from thia country.
The expectation ia that the huge
exports of wheat which the United

be greatly reduced.

It was announced that the Mexican
ambassador designate, Honor Arredondo,
and Secretary loosing 'have deduilely
decided upon tho New Hampshire town
where the treaty of peace between Ja
pan aad Buasia waa arranged, is the
ideal place for the conferences of the
joint commission.
The Mexican commissioners were
named some daya ago. The refussl of
Supreme Court Justice Brandeia to
serve on the commisHion, owing to press
of work, delayed the naming of the
American commission for some time,
but it aa finally announced that hoc
rotary of the Interior Lane would head
the I'nited Ktates delegation.

lowed a conference between Keuor Ar

The immediate military aituation on
the bonier disposed of, the commission
will be ready to proceed with Its ro
maining specific task, investigation to
determine whether iuterests desiring

in tracing the source of these raids.

Without doubt it will have power to
travel to the border or, if necessary,
into Mexico, in following up its in
quirv. '
There have been intimations that
American iimisteuee upon broadening
the scope of the commission's powers
has been due to the hope that a way
of giving constructive aid to the Car

(Associated Press by Pederal Wireless)
PARIS, August 29. Rumania
has joined the Entente Allies:
and yesterday declared war
against Austria-Hungary. The
(ierinan government immediately
answered this move by declaring
war against Rumania.
Kven before the formal declara- .
tion of war, according to the Ber
lin and Vienna claims, Rumania
had struck. Her troops had pene
trated the passes of the Transyl
vanian Alps, or Eastern Carps-
thians, and yesterday were report
ed to be advancing in the direc
tion of Hermannstadt and Kron
stadt. These towns are the cap- '
itals of Hungarian provinces of '
the same names, and their popu-'.
lations are largely Rumanian,... .
Indeed, in Kronstadt and Her
mannstadt the number of Ruma- ,
nians is said to exceed the Hun
garian inhabitants, and Vienna
intimated in an official despatch,
last night, that the advance of the
Rumanian legions had been ra
pid. Kronstadt is about twenty miles
from the Rumanian border,- and
Hermannstadt, on the Alufa river,
is about twice that distance. Both
towns are important centers, with'
railroad communication, of value
to military commanders,
