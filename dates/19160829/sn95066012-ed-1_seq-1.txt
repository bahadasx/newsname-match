Washington, Aug. 28. Some 12.0(H)
men of Ohio, Vermont and Kentucky
National Guard regiments still held In

ed by the war department today to
proceed to the Mexican border. Tho
department revoked the suspension of
an order for their movement issued
two weeks ago. All the regiments
will go forward to join Gen. Funston's
command as rapidly as transportation
can be supplied. Some units were on
the move tonight.
There remain approximately 13,-
000 guardsmen scattered through
many states who are not affected by
today's order.
The original order sending south
ward all troops called into the federal
service was Issued by the war depart
ment in order that the divisional units
along the international line might he
tilled up and also that those regiments
which were not ready to go in to the
first rush might share in the training
as soon as they could be fully equip
ped. When the railway strike situa
tion became threatening Gen. Kunston
recommended that the whole move
ment be held up as tho supply dif-
llculty in case of a rail tie-up would
be complicated by the addition 6f 25.

The department now has decided
that the strike situation may continue
unchanged for some time.

OF BIG STRIKE
Senator Newlands Preparing Bill
to Meet Emergency
PRESIDENT BEFORE CONGRESS
Was to Address Joint Assembly on
Railroad Situation at 2,30 This
Afternoon.
Washington, Aug. 29. Operation of
tin; country's railroads under military
rule is one of the possibilities in tin.1
event of the strike which the Brother
hood of Hallway trainmen threatens
to call on Labor day. Senator New
lands is preparing a bill with such a
feature embodied and which may be
presented to Congress should all Oth
er attempts tn prevent a tie-up ot the
transportation lines tail.
'resident Wilson was to address the
joint assembly at 2.30 thTs afternoon.
Washington, Aug. 29. 'resident
Wilson last night definitely decided to
go iielore l ongress m person touaj
or tomorrow to recommend legislation
limed to avert the threatened nation
wide railroad .strike or to stop it if it
Comes belore Congress can act. He
worked until late last night on his
message, in winch he will tell mem
bers of the Senate and House the
negotiations to date and lay belore
them a definite legislative program.
The president reached this decision
after conferences at the White House
with the committee of eight railroad
presidents and the four brotherhood
heads on a new proposal for settle
ment of differences, suggested by the
executives, and alter a prolonged dis
cussion of the situation at the capitol
with the members of the democratic
steering committee ot the Senate.
When the railroad brotherhood
heads went to the White House last
night, the president not only laid be
fore them the plan of the executives,
but strongly urged the withdrawal of
a tentative strike order sent out Sun
day, subject to release, calling for a
walkout of the luo.non brotherhood
members at 7 a. m. Labor day. Sep
tember 4. This request was flatly re
fused, the leaders saying only, the
committee of 640, which left Washing
ton Sunday, had power to recall the
order.
Copies of the strike order were
brought to the president's attention
after they had gotten into the posses
sion of the railroad executives. It had
been known that the members of the
committee of !40 carried home With
them a tentative order, but no one
outside the brotherhood councils had
suspected a date had been set. and the
president is said to have been greatly
perturbed by the Information. After
tho refusal to withdraw the order he
communicated with the railroad presi
dents, who held a meeting that lasted
until late in tin1 night.
In spite of the apparent final failure
of his efforts to bring the two sides to
gether, the president was represented
last night as being still hopeful of
averting a strike.
Die legislative program prepared
for Congress includes the following
measures:
an eight hour day law for railroad
employes so framed as to give the rail
roads time to prepare for it: and
law patteretied after the Canadian
industrial disputes act providing for
investigation of industrial disputes on
railroads by a commission and prohlb
iting strikes or lockouts pending the
Outcome of the Investigation.
In addition to these measures there
aro under consideration a resolution
to increase tho revenues of the rail
roads In case tho expenses aro in
creased and a law creating authority
for the operation of the railroads un
der the federal government in event
of a strike. The plan last night was
to have the first two measures Intro
duced as amendments to the bill,
which has already passed the House,
increasing the interstate commerce
commission from seven to nine mem

while not unexpected, created the
greatest enthusiasm in Loudon.
Long after the news had been re

REUNION
ARLINGTON BOYS
AFFLICTED WITH
Two Sons of Representative H. A.
Hulet Victims of Dread Disease
ONE CHILD IS SERIOUSLY ILL
Family Also Anxious Concerning Con.
dition of Little Daughter in Troy
Hospital.
Dr. C. H. Beecher of nurlington,
who was summoned by Dr. G. A. Rus
sell, the local physician, Monday af
ternoon pronounced tho two cases at
the home of Representative H. A. Hu
let of Arlington to be infantile paraly
sis. The children afflicted are two
boys, 12 and 14 years old.
A little daughter early last week
was taken to the Samaritan hospital
in Troy apparently suffering from ap
pendicitis. She underwent an opera
tion and the appendix was found to be
Inflamed but not sufficiently to ac
count for alarming symptoms. Tho
latest report from the hospital was
that the child was experiencing
trouble with one arm and there Is
considerable anxiety lest the number
of known victims of the dread epi
demic be increased.
The two boys have not been out of
the state during the present summer
and have seldom left the immediate
vicinity of their home which is about
a quarter of a mile north of tho
Bhaftsbury line In the. town of Arling
ton. Dr. Beecher. when making his ex
amination Monday, could account for
the cases in only one way, that the
boys have come iii contact with chil
dren passing through Shaftsbury who
had developed the fever preliminary
to the disease and were therefore ear
ners oi the disease. Serum was used
in both cases.
All possible quarantine precautions
have been taken at the Hulet home
and the family, notwithstanding its
great grief, is exerting every effort to
protect its neighbors.
CLOSING DAY ON PLAYGROUND
Labor
Day, Sept. 4th. Will
Cose
Summer Activities.
As previously announced the clos
ing day on the Playground will bo
celebrated by the annual automobile
ride, combined with a picnic. This is
a slight deviation from the usual order
of events, but in view of the intense
heat of the summer, and that possible
danger oi disease contagion through
bringing together a large number of
people, it was thought advisable by
the committee of Public Celebrations
to give the children a good time in a
quieter and less public way. The
plan is to select a nice, shady spot
within reasonable distance from Ben
nington and transport tho children
there by automobiles. Each child is
to bring his own lunch. A program
of entertainment will he provided
which will keep all happy every
minute. Announcements have been
