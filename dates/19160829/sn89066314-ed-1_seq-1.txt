BAKERS ARE DIVIDED
ON BREMESTION
Some Columbia Dealers Fav
or Increase in Price to
.Six Cents.
ONLY 1-CENT PROFIT
Ten-Cent Loaf and Decrease
in the Weight Are Al
so Advocated.
The rise in the price of the ma
terials that are used in the making
of bread and the agitation for a 6
fiit loaf by the National Association
of Master Bakers' at their convention
last week in Chicago has brought the
problem of the price of bread to the
bakers of Columbia.
E V. Crosswhite of the Crosswhite
Bakery said today that he is not us
ing a thing for making bread that has
not gone up i" price. "Of course." he
said, "there is a profit even at the
present price, but it is hardly worth
the trouble of baking wrapping and
delivering the bread. The price must
be raised, and the people ought to be
satisfied that the increase is only 1
cent. Yes. I think 1 will raise the
price of bread, for with all the ris
ing prices. 1 find that it is necessary."
B. Gentsch of the Gentseh Bakery
said that he was not sure of his de
cision if he were asked by the na
tional association to raise the price
of bread.
Fat or the lnrrea-e.
J. 1 Hetzlcr of Hctzler Brothers
said the people had every reason to
be satisfied with such a small in
crease in the price of bread. "It is
very reasonable." he said. "The rise
will not help the grocer at all. In
fact he will lose by it if you count
the percentage of his profit before
the rise and after The bakers will
raise the price to ,"i cents, and we will
sell it to the consumers for 6 cents.
This gives us a cent profit on G cents,
where before we made a cent on a 5
cnt loaf."
A H. I.yon figured up the profit on
a .".-cent loaf of bread counting only
the high price of flour at present and
found that the profit was almost ze
ro. He thought the rise very neces
sary T C. Bonner said that the trouble
lay in the uncertain condition of the
price of bread among the Columbia
bakeries. "There are a few things the
matter with the bread business." he
said. "There is no use. raising the
price of bread to C cents. In the first
place it is a very inconvenient price.
Persons will have to carry pennies
with them. There is a better way.
The price could remain the same and
the loaf made smaller. This is being
done now. but some men are abusing
the practice. They are making the
people believe that they are getting
the same size loaf, when the truth
is. they are getting a loaf of bread
full of air that weighs far below the
regular number of ounces.''
-Should Standarille Weight."
"The one big thing that the peo
ple ought to do is to have a law pass
ed standardizing the weight of the
3-ecnt loaf and make it necessary
that the number of ounces be printed
on each wrapper. Then the people
would not get fooled as they are now.
"The best practical solution to the
whole trouble is to push the 10-cent
loaf as much as possible, and even so
far as doing away with the 5-cent
loaf There is no profit in the small
loaf There is much more expense to
it than to the big loaf. In two 5
eent loaves two ounces evaporates,
while in a 10-cent loaf there is much
less Then the wrapping paper has
gone up Last year I paid one-sixth
of a cent for each wrapper: this year
I pay one-third of a cent. That's
double the former price. On two 5-
out loaves I use two wrappers, and
1 use only one on a 10-cent loaf, so
von ee the expense is less.
Then the 5-cent loaf is getting cut
down to such a size now that it is
hardly enough for a meal. People
ought to understand this, and instead
of getting two 5-cent loaves, they
should get one 10-cent loaf, for they
will get quantity and also better
quality
"Perhaps you know that it is more
expensive to bake bread in St. Louis
or Kansas City. The freight adds
to the expense. For yeast alone there
is an added expense of $75 a year
that the bakers in the cities haven't.
So we would find it almost impossi

"As for the raising of the price. I
do not know what I shall do. If I
can afford it. I shall continue at the

HIGH COST OF LIVING
HITS STUDENTS, TOO
Pool Hall Magnates Double
Prices and Cause Gloom
on the Campus.
Now that the billiard hall "mag
nates" of Columbia have entered in
to a. combine to raise the price of
poll to .". cents per cue on the Eng
lish student of the Iri.-h linen, and
since the Greeks and ether multi
colored races cf the town have sent
sk ward the price of shines, the hen
pecked hubby will have to ask wife
for one more nickel with which to
glisten his brogans and "Dad" will be
askei to add a few more simoleons
to the student's monthly allowance
for "incidentals." The very next
hardship that the European struggle
is expected to wreak upon the wage
earner of Columbia will come when
the shoe string vendors will strike
for a raise. If Diogenese could walk
in upon twentieth century Columbia,
would he net marvel that he rented
living quarters in his tub at such a
low rate?
Today seven billiard halls of Co
lumbia are charging .". cents per cue
for pocket billiards. The agreement
to raise the price was reached ves
terday at a meeting of the owners
when it was agreed without a dissent
ing vote, of course, that a legitimate
profit could not be made at the old
rate of ." cents, the price that has been
in vogue here for the last four years.
But the proprietors were good enough
t3 allow the price of billiards to re
main at CO cents per hour. And the
game of "forty-one" known better by
the frequenters of that pastime, will
remain for the time being at the old
prue of 2 1-2 cents per cue.
The bootblacks were the first to lay
the blame on the European war for
the raise in the price of shines. Now
it will cost you 10 cents to get your
boots pasted in the usual way- Dull
finishes may go to two-bits per and
who knows what it may co.-t to set
the Greeks to wrestle with a muddy
pair of kicks?
Even the two-bit meals at the cafes
are taking an ascension at the rate
of 10 cents. But whether or not the
proprietors will promise anything in
addition to the regular menu of string
beans, spuds, a slice of tomato and a
cup of Java is a question. Some ct
the down-town boarders will look for
ward to the addition of a finger bowl
and a paper napkin for the added
charge.
But then, let's lay it on the Eura
pean war and agree with the price
lifters that it is all in keeping with
twentieth century progress. But
when the conflict across the iond is
ended what excuse then?

Prosecuting Attorney Peters protest
ed that it was no verdict at all and
insisted that the jury either hold
someone responsible or declare the ac

The testimony before the coroner's
jury was conflicting In reference to
the lights on the machine that was
struck Louis Spaunhorst said there
were no lights on the machine, and

WASHINGTON. Aug. 21. As a dra

the Cnittd States, President Wilson
this afternoon appeared before a joint
session of ''ongress and urged legis

He said he urged the legislation
"not in haste or merely as a means
of getting a present emergencv but

just, if such emergencies are to be
prevented in the future."

He recommended:
Immediate provision for the en

a thoroughness which are with its
