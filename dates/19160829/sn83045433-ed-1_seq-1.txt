Brotherhoods Refuse to With
draw Order for Strike.
Wilson Pushes Plans.
President Vilson last night informed
the railway executives that the brother
hood chiefs had refused at last nights
conference to withdraw the strike order.
which is dated September 4.
The executives held a meeting and dig
cussed the developments without arriv
ing at any decision. They will confer
nith the President at the White House
again this morning.
The refusal of the brotherhood leaders
to grant the White flouse reues!, it was
explainred, does not mean that the strike
order will automatically become effec
Uve September 4. The understanding
among the union officials is that the
operatives will not t called upon to stop
work until a code message J6 sent to the
chairmen I:: their respecti'e home dis
trits. It remaine to be seen whether
President Wilson will succeed in W'e
vcntin.; this message being sent out.
Several of the railwai executives made
arrangements last night to leave Wash
ington today after their committee sees
President Wilson. They said the grav
ity of the situation demanded that they
return to their properties. They did not
consider the situation hopeless, but
thought it n - 'nearly so."
It was state! liat night that the Presi
dent has under consideration an appeAl
to the csuntry at large. including both
the railwav employes and the executives
asking both sides to sacrifice their own
interests if ticessary to the public in
terest.
PresIdent Wilson's plans for new leg
islatIon by which the threatened railway
strike may be averted was adopted by
the Senate steering con~nittee yester
day.
Democratic leaders were given to un
derstand the President expects to be able
to prevent the execution of a strike order
pending the outconie of his efforts.
An eight-hour day to be compulsory.
on interstate railroads within thirty days
after enactment is the pivot around
which the new legislatiOn will be con
structed.
President Wilson will appear before
a joint session of the Senate and the
House today, or tomorrow at the lat

s pecial message.
Before the new program became

TWO MORE BABIES IN
CLUTCH OF PARALYSIS
Health Officers' Regulations Sent to
Commissioners.
Two new cases of infantile paralysis
were reported to the Health Department
yesterday afternoon. They are Joseph
Rock. 4 years. 63 Columbia road north
west, and Samuel luston. 2 years, 432
Georgia avenue northwest.
The rules and regulations drafted by
the health ofcers were sent up to the
commissioners, recommended but not an
lroved by Health Officer Woodward. Dr.
W.oodward is not opposed to regulations
with the view of ,hecking the disease.
but he does not believe the present rules
will be 0f service, because in districts
where paralysis has become an epidemic.
the most drastic regulations have failed
to -heck its spread.
Dr. Woodward stated that he thought
thp peoplp of the district should be given
the advantage of the best thought and
tuV by doctors who have occasion to
carefully examine paralysis cascA and
for this reason he recommends the rules.
There is one thing the health offlicer
stated he Indorses. and it is for the peo
ple of the district to express their views
,f the situation, to the Commis.ioners.
The people will have to live under the
regulations. and it is only natural that
they should have some interest in their
form.
