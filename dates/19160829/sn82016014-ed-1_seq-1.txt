a- M-erMary of Kcpublieun state
central committee.
i-oiiiiiiitteo elected Charles? Session of
Topekii a. state chairman by acclama
tion. All other officers of the state
committee were named without' a
fight. State and district candidates
and county chairmen then went into
their party council to write a state
plat form and listen to oratory. Har
mony of the srenuine brand prevailed.
Kight from the jump today the Re
publicans worked in unison. Clever
teerirg committees worked out the
day's program in advance. Every
move was made to win votes in Xo
vem ber.
Sessions Made Chairman.
When the state committee met in
the National hotel every detail for the
election of campaign managers had
been worked out. So effort was made
to upset the program. Al F. Wil
lams of Columbus, mentioned for the
state chairmanship, refused to go into
a fight. John Cireer of Marion, also a
possibility, took similar action. Charles
H. Sessions of Topeka was nominated
by K. K. Brewster of Leavenworth and
elected by acclamation. Other officers
K. J. Hopkins, vice chairman; W.
C. Markhani. secretary, and Guy Glas
cock, treasurer were chosen in a sim
ilar manner. Harmony fairly bubbled
out of the meeting.
Sessions talked to the state commit-,
tee for five minutes. In those five
minutes he gave the state committee
more concrete facts and valuable in
formation than many state chairmen
have unloaded in the course of a cam
paign. He outlined the plan of battle
and the county chairmen declared
they were with him to the last ditch.
Fconoiny and Harmony.
The new chairman linked economy
with harmony. He mentioned the loss
of campaign funds three-fourths of
the former state committee assets.
Sessions estimated thru the passage
of the civil service law. He talked
about the law limiting campaign ex
penses. So Sessions urged a campaign
for votes with one eye on a sagging
pocketbook.
October Look Out!
Not until October, Sessions declared,
would the big fireworks be exploded in
Kansas. Then look out. Sessions de
clared he had written to the national
committee that Kansas did not want
second rate down east speakers. Kan
hos wants top liners or nothing
Huiches. Taft. Roorevelt, Borah, Cum
mins and a few other major leaguers.
And what is more. Sessions told the
Charles S. Sessions of Topeka, who
will direct the Republican battle as
chairman of the State Central com
mittee. state committee he was going after big
game and expected to get it. The
state campaign will be short, but lots
of powder will be burned.
From the hotel, the Republicans
went to Representative hall to build a
taate platform and unlimber a little
oratory. The noon session was short
and formal. Very, very formal. There
was nothing spectacular about it. A
midweek prayer meeting could have
been no more decorous.
Saved Thirty Minutes.
J. T. Botkin, secretary of state,
opened the session. He called the
council to order and started to read
the roll of men who had a vdte. But
the council took his word for it. The
roll was approved without reading.
Thirty minutes were saved.
Then the council got right down to
business. It was thirty minutes after
the noon luncheon hour and some of
the candidates and county chairmen
were hungry. A. M. Keene of Fort
Scott, was nominated as chairman of
the council. Again there was no dis
pute. John Greer of Marion, was
mentioned for secretary. Unanimous.
H. F. Blundon of Salina, was nominat
ed for assistant secretary. More har
mony. Governor Capper, R. J. Hop-
j kins and Al. F. Willians were named
I as a committee to escort Keene to the
i chair. No voice was raised to protest,
j Seven minutes of actual time had been
j consumed. The council was making
, great progress. Standpatters and Pro
gressives were recognized as equals.
The candidates were looking ahead to
the November ballot box.
Committee on Resolution.
The formal matter of a committee
on resolutions the big committee to
write the state platform was needed.
It required less than five minutes to
name the committee. All the old sore
spots were forgotten and men whs
have not sat together on political
committees in years were named. Two
members were named from each con
gressional district to work with state
candidates in writing the platform.
This is the committee:
First district: C. p:. Snyder, Leav
enworth; F. T. Woodburn, Holton;
Second district: E. C. Little, Kansas
City; W. O. Knight, Olathe; Third dis
trict: E. D. Maxwell. George Work;
Fourth district: G. H. Lamb. Tates
Center; A. R. Engelman, Alma; Fifth
district: C. M. Harger, Abilene; Fred

M. Mahin, Smith Center; Lewis Bank
er, Russell; Seventh district: J. S.
Simmons, Hutchinson; F. C. Price.
Ashland; Eighth district: A. M. Gettes,
Eldorado; J. H. Stewart, Wichita.
Then the council yelled for some
thing to eat. A recess was taken un
til 2 o'clock. At 1:30 the resolutions
committee took its first look at the
platform planks.
GRAND IS 0. K.-M'BRIDE
State I,alKr Commissioner says Thea

Improvements being made at the
Grand theater will bring the building
up to the standard required under an
order of Paul McBride, state labor

wires, the wiring of the building has
been done in accordance with our or
ders and recommendations," said Mc
Bride. "These wires will be placed in
a few days and the building will be in
condition by September 1. I am ad

been made. The other improvements
are being made at this time. I am ad

After electing officers and appoint
ing a committee on resolutions and
permanent organization, the Demo
cratic party council adjourned to the
city auditorium, until 4:30 o'clock this
afternoon. Members of the resolu
tions committee went immediately to
the Throop hotel, closeted themselves
in a room and began the erection of a
platform to be submitted and voted
upon late this afternoon.
Praise for Wilson.
Advance information on the planks
to be placed in the Democratic plat
form indicated that the work of
Woodrow Wilson, especially his suc
cess in keeping the country out of
war, would be paramount. Also, the
alleged mud throwing and non-constructive
campaign being waged by
the Republican nominee, Charles
Evans Hughes, will receive condem
nation at the hands of the Democrats,
Assail Capper Tactics.
In state affairs hotel talk in the
lobby revealed that the present Cap
per administration will be assailed for
breaking campaign promises, for rais
ing the taxes' and valuations on all
property excepting that owned by the
corporations. Constructive legislation

came to Topeka to help whip the
Bourbon organization into shape for
the campaign.
endorsed in the platform will include
a mother's pension bill, minimum
wage for women and an 8-hour basis
for wages in all industrial occupations
farmers not included.
Somewhat similar tactics to those
of the party council were adopted by
the state committee. After electing of
ficers and transacting a little routine
business, the committee adjourned td1
a late hour this afternoon when an at
tempt will be made to make a more
effectual state organization than the
Democrats have enjoyed in years.
Ijeave All to Lansdon.
Thruout the meeting of the state
committee the fact was paramount
that the wishes and desires of W. C.
Lansdon. candidate for governor, were
receiving consideration. Prior to the
transaction of each piece of business
a whispered conversation was held by
various members of the committee
with the aSlina man.
Following his election as chairman,
Hubert Lardner sounded the keynote
of the state campaign, urging uphold
ing the hands of Woodrow Wilson by
re-electing the present Democratic
congressmen and a Democratic gover
nor. These were achievements within
the range of possibilities, he stated.
Not a word relative to the election of
others on the ticket.
E. E. Murphy of Leavenworth, re
tiring state chairman, took the oppor
tunity to pour hot shot into half a
hundred county chairmen. He de
clared that there are fifty counties in
the state without a perfected Demo
cratic organization.
"But the chairmen in these coun
ties, said the retiring chairman,
"come to Topeka and make the big
gest noice of anyone at our meetings.
They should either co-operate or re
sign. "Some do not even have the polite
ness to answer communications ad
dressed to them. But they are on
hand when there are any honorary
appointments to he parceled out. I
don't care who this hurts I am not a
candidate for an office and never will
be."
A suggestion was made to send an
organizer over the state to weed out
derelicts. Further discussion was end
ed when it was moved to adjourn un
til late this afternoon when plans of
oorganization will be decided upon.

DRAFT JRAINMEN
Military Law to Run Trains Is
Wilson Plan.
Deny Scoring by President for
Calling Strike.
Washington, Aug. 29. Military
operation of the railroads of the
United States, with the present train
crews operating the trains under mili
tary draft, is the definite prospect for
the country. If the strike, set for
Monday by the railroad brotherhoods
takes place, that is the course Presi
dent "Wilson has in mind. It became
known today.
To this end, Senator Xewlands, after
a morning conference with the presi
dent, took up with Attorney General
Gregory. Interstate Commerce Com
missioner Clark and Chairman Adam
son of the house interstate commerce
committee, the preparation of a bill
to make such action possible.
"To Draft Von First."
President Wilson was quoted today
as having declared his purpose last
night'to the four heewtls of the brother
hoods in a session with them at the
White House.
"I intend to get thru a measure," he
is credited with having said, "empow
ering me to draft into service men for
military operation of the roads, and
I you will be the first ones I will draft.''
I A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
. leaders, who saw the president last
night, however, declared today the
j president made no such statement.
I He denied also reports that the
i president had scored them for setting
( the date for the strike while the ne
I gotlations still are in progress.
HOLDUP AT GIRARD

Teutons Lose Heavily in Big
Rush at Fleury.
London, Aug. 29. Germany is pre
paring for Greece's entrance into the
war, said a Copenhagen dispatch to
the Exchange Telegraph today. A
number of Greeks already have left
Germany, the dispatch said, and diplo
mats at Berlin believe war inevitable.
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg
will receive the Greek minister tomor

French Are Successful.
Paris, Aug. 29. The French made
considerable progress in violent at
tacks on the Verdun front last night it
was officially announced today. Some
prisoners were taken.
The French gains were made south
east of Thiaumont Work.
The Germans made two attacks on
Fleury village and in the vicinity of
Fort Vaux but were completely check
ed, losing heavily.
Great Battle Soon.
Berlin, Aug. 29. A great battle may
occur along the Rumanian frontier
within a few hours.
Rumania has been concentrating
large forces along the Transylvanian
border for several days, the Tageblatt
reported today. The Teutonic forces
took prompt measures to guard
against a sudden invasion and have
massed sufficient troops to meet the
Rumanian attack.
The patrol skirmishes reported in
yesterday's official war office state
ment may mark the beginning of an
important engagement.
The Berlin newspapers commented
with great restraint today upon Ru
mania's entrance into the war.
No Important Part.
The general opinion of German
critics is that Rumania will play no
Important part in military annals ex
cept that it will -be necessanr to re-
ugroup the forces of the Central Pow
ers to some extent to meet the new
enemy. The Lokal Anzeiger points
that the Rumanian declaration does
not affect the food situation because
Rumania has exported little food to
Germany and Austria lately.
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg
held a lengthy conference today with
the leading ministers, including TJr.
Helferich, vice chancellor, and Acting
Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs

Calls Compulsory Investigation
"Throttle to Labor."
MUST PASS LAWS SPEEDILY
If "ot Thru by Monday, Will
'ot Affect Strike.
Congress Won't Pass 8-Hour
Law Says Garretson.
Day Dcvelopmrnts In Strike.
Washington, Aug. 29. A summary of de
velopments in the strike situation follows:
Negotiations between the railroads and
tna brotherhoods thru President Wilson
were definitely broken off.
The brotherhood leaders definitel or
dered the strike to begin at 7 a. in. Labor
Day next Monday) unless tbe order Is
countermanded and declared that only a
settlement favorable to the men would
change it.
President Wilson went before Congress
hi joint session at 2:30 o'clock this after
noon with proposals for new laws to pre
vent the strike. The latest authentic out
line of tbs proposals is as follows :
Increase of the interstate commerce com
mission from seven to nine members.
An eight-hour law for railroad employes
in actual interstate transportation.
To empower the federal board of media
tion to fully investigate operation of an
eight-hour day on railroads.
To empower the interstate commerce
commission to consider the elght-honr day
in connection with making rates.
A measure similar to the Canadian in-
dustrial disputes act for an investigation
of all disputes between railroads and their
employes.
A measure empowering the president to
I operate tmlnp with th; primary object of
providing the American troops on the Mex
ican border ,with food.
The brotherhood leaders favor the eight
hour day features but oppose the proposal
to adopt theCauadian plan.
Washington. Aug. 29. Brotherhood
leaders, it was understood today, will
fight the compulsory investigation
feature of President Wilson's legisla
tive program but support his eight
hour proposal.
Every effort will be made, it was
said, to get separate votes on the
proposition in congress and leaders
were confident that could be done.
A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
men. expressed himself as strongly op
posed to the compulsory investigation
plan and while ne did not entirely ap
prove of the proposed eight hour bill
he said that it would bring benefits
to such numbers of non-union men
that the railroad doubtless would op
pose it and he thought the brother
hoods would be behind it.
Ienounces Canadian Law.
"The Canadian compulsory investi
gation plan," he said, "has proven the
greatest throttle to labor thrt ever has
been devised. Invariably, and I speak
from experience, in dealing with rail
ways the railway heads have used this
delay guaranteed them by law to pre
pare for a strike.
"The eight-hour day proposal fail
ing to carry, as it will of course, any
reference to wages would not embrace
our present demands and not be whol
ly satisfactory to us. It would have
the effect, however, of bringing the
unorganized 80 per cent of railway
lahnr of which the railway heads
Bpeak so feelingly under an eight-hour
day. It would be a step in the right
direction and I think you would find
I the railroads opposing it vigorously,
i "in order to have any effect on the
present proposed strike the president's
I legislative program wouia nave to
j pass both houses and become a law
i before next Monday morning."
I Once the men have left their trains.
' compulsory investigation would not af
fect them, in me opinion oi oroirier
hood officials. The officials declined
to discuss this phase of the situation
further.
Claims Society Opposes It.
The statement presented to Presi
dent Wilson by the committee of eight
denies1 that the judgment of society
favors an elght-houi- day and declared
that arbitration is the only proper
way of settling industrial disputes.
The suggestion of President Wilson
for a proposal including the principle
of the eight-hour day but postponing
its effectiveness for a year pending in
vestigation was rejected by the rail
road executives at the conference this
morning. The action of the railroad
presidents taken in connection with
the strike order of the employes, left
President Wilson no alternative but to
go to congress in a final effort to
avert the strike by legislation.
Senator Newlands conferred with
Senator Cummins, a Republican mem
ber of the interstate commerce com
mittee; Representative Adamson,
chairman of the house interstate com
merce committee, and temocratic
Leader Kitchin. One bill discussed
provides for a basic eight-hour day,
that the interstate commerce commis
sion fix the maximum wages In all
cases of dispute temporarily pending
any commission adjustment of rates
and that "it w-ill be unlawful for any
employe on any interstate railroad
carrying United States mail to quit
service without giving six days notice,
except by consent of the employer.'
Provides Heavy Penalties.
It would prohibit any two or more
persons operating interstate railroads
(or roads carrying the united States
i mails from "combining and conspir
i ing to quit at the same time and there
by interfere with and obstruct the
operation of such trains to the loss
and detriment of the public.
The penalizing action of the bill
v-'ould make violation a misdemeanor
punishable by a minimum fine of
Si 0.000 or maximum imprisonment
for ten years.
There was some opposition to it in
the conference and also some oppo
sition to the plan to amend the house
bill to enlarge the interstate commerce
committee membership.
Issue Formal Strike Order.
While President Wilson was an
nouncing that he would lay the rail
way strike situation before congress at
2:30 o'clock today the brotherhood
leaders rejected the latest proposition
of the committee of railway presidents
and actually ordered the strike to be
gin at 7 a. m. Labor day unless a set
tlement satisfactory to them is reach
ed in the meantime.
Their previous order for the strike
was tentative and required a secret
signal to put it into effect. Unless a
settlement satisfactory to the labor
leaders is reached before that time
or unless President Wilson and con
gress find some way to prevent it the
strike would start Labor day without
further notice. The labor leaders ad
mitted they took their action the first
thing today in the belief that some
rreans was being sought to prevent
the strike actually being called. By
their action they thitiK they have an
ticipated any legal processes which
might be brought against them.
BLOW TWO BANKS
Six Robbers Take $13,000 From

Cut Wires Into Town Delaying
Citizens' Alarm.
Danville, 111., Aug. 29. Six robbers
blew the safes of two banks at Homer,
111., near here early today and escaped
with $13,000. They left town in an
automobile going west.
The explosions at the two .banks
were simultaneous and so muffled
that only a few people were awak
ened. Eight thousand and five hun
dred dollars was taken from the Ray
nor & Babb bank and $4,500 from
the Citizens' bank.
There was some delay in spreading
the alarm as the gang cut all wires
into town. The hanks could not open
this morning until money had been
shipped to them from Danville.

SIGNS 3 BIG BILLS
President Wilson Approves
Army and avy Legislation.
Ceremony in Presence of 100
, Prominent Persons.
Washington, Aug. "9. President
Wilson today signed the army, navy,
Philippine and bill of ladings bills.
The ceremony was featured by the
presence of nearly a hundred persons,
including Secretary of War Bauer,
members of the committees which
handled the different bills in the house
and senate, pi ominent Filipinos and
others.
"I think the whole country will
feel," said President Wilson, after
signing the army appropriation bill,
"that this congress has done a great
service in the cause of national de
fense. This bill, which provides ap
propriations for the army and does not
deal with the reorganization plan
shows that the nation's finances are
behind the defense movement. The
navy is a remarkable one. Never be
fore has so much been done to develop
this branch of the service. The
Philippine bill excites peculiar feeling
in me because there have been times
when the people of the islands have
doubted our spirit toward them. This
provides for a genuine and broader
self government, contentment and
political capacity. It is high time this
country admitted this act of justice.
MINORITY PARTIES
Prohibitionists and Socialists Meet to
Formulate Platforms.
Prohlbitionsts and Socialists sev
eral of them are today writing party
platforms. Both of the minor parties
are holding platform meetings in To
peka today, but general interest in
their cessions is offset by the pro
grams of the Republicans and Demo
crats. Several Prohibitionists today held a
session in the office of J. T. Botkin,
secretary of state. The Socialists met
in the supreme court chambers. Both
of these parties will adopt platforms.
Xo plans will be made, tho, for state
headquarters during the campaign and
it is hardly probable either of the par
ties will open offices in Topeka, during
the pre-election fight. .

Washington, Aug. 29. As a drama-
tie climax to his unprecedented nego
tiations to avert the most disastrous
labor war that ever threatened the
United States, President Wilson this
afternoon before a Joint session of
congress urged legislation "to safe
guard the life and interests of the na
tion." He said he urged the legislation
'not in haste or merely as a means of
meeting a present emergency but as
permanent and necessary additions to
the law, suggested, indeed, by circum
stances wre had hoped never to see, but
imperative as well as Just, if such
emergencies are to be prevented In
the future."
The president outlined in detail his
efforts to effect a settlement of the
pending dispute through friendly ne
gotiations. His efforts he said, had
"resulted in complete deadlock.'
Mediation Has Failed.
Now the country faces, he said, a
great national calamity with "citiea
cut off from food supplies and the
commerce of the nation paralysed.
Countless thousands will in all likli
hood be brought, it may be, to the very
point of starvation."
Mediation under the existing laws
has failed, he admitted, and arbitra
tion has been rendered impossible "by
the attitude of the men."
He said that he had offered the
eight hour day as a basis for agree
ment because "the whole spirit of the
time and the preponderant evidence
of recent economic experience" spoke
out for it.
In the face of indications that the
railways would "ultimately be obliged
to accept the eight lwwr--day toy -eon ?
certed action of organized labor,
backed by the favorable Judgment of
societ5 "they have declined to ac
cept this means of settlement. he
said.
President's Speech to Congress.
President Wilson spoke as follows:
"Gentlemen of the congress:
"I have come to you to seek your
assistance in dealing with a very grave
situation which has arisen out of the
demand :if the employes of the rail
roads engaged in freight trin service
that they be grafted an 8-i.our work

an hour and half of service for every
hour of work beyond the eight.
"The matter has been agitated for
more thai a yr The public has
been familiar with :he demands of
the men and the argument urged in
favor of them and even more familiar
with thn objections of the railroads
and their counter-demands that cer
tain provision now enjoyed by their
men and certain bases of payment
worked out thru many years of con
test be reconsidered, especially in thnr
i elation to the adoption of an ?-hur

"The matter came some thre weel.s
igo to a final issue and resulted i;t h
complete deadloK between the pai
ties. The means provided by la w c.
mediation of the ctiwoversy fulled
and the means of arbitration for which
the law provides wre rejected. The
representatives of the-sail way execu
tives proposed that the rtpmanda be
submitted in their entirety to arbi
tration along with certain questions
of readjustment as to pav and condi
tions of employment which seemed
to them to be clearly associated with
the demands or to call for reconsider

absolutely declined arbitration, espe
cially if any of their estitblishi d pro
visions were by that means to be
drawn avain in question. The law in

them.
"The four hundred thousand men
