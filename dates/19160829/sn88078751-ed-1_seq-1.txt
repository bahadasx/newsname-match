ITALY AT

Declaration

Action May
For
Home, Aug. 28. Italy has declared
K 4
War against Germany. From today she
considers herself the ' enemy - of her
former ally.
Both nations have boeu drifting,
steadily toward war. In fact, Italy's
formal declaration amounts to llttlu
more than ofllcial recognition of a
state of afuirs whfch already existed.
Tho declaration became Inevitable
whon Itt'y recently sont troops . to
Salonlki to co-operate in tho cam
paign of the entente allies pn tho
Maccdonion front, as Germany is di
recting tiie opposing forces and has
troops on this battlu lino.
The lncoasing co-operation among
the entente allies and the necessity
for bringing into service Italy's surplus-troops,
-which could not bo cm
ployed on the other fronts without
bringing on war with Germany, grad
ually brought Italy Into such a posi
tion that it became evident a declara
tion of hostilities against 'Germany
was only a matter of time.
The first over net in this direction
occurred F'lortly after the Paris con
ference, probably as a result of it On

ot the tlilrty-seven German steamships
interned in Italian ports to fcolp meet
tho pressing needs of the allies for
shipping facilities.
Italy's action probably will have
Xttlo effect on the military situation
in the immediate future, atlhough as
tho war goes on It may have & moro
Important bearing. On tho Austro
Italian front Italy finds nctlvo use for
hardly more than half of hor army,
and In future can send available
troops to any front. Having com
mitted horsolf already to tho
Macedonian campaign, Italy's stop is
of no significance as respects that
theater of war. Germany hereafter
will bo free to take such ptrt in the
Austro-ltnllun campaign as may be
decided on by the Teutonic alllos.

Columbus, Aug. 28. Unless other
orders from Washington aro received
in the interval, tho Fifth regiment
will leave Camp Willis tomorrow,
going via the Big Four to Cincinnati,
thence to New Orleans and via tho
Southern Pacific to El Paso, which
is to bo division headquarters.
Wednesday the Fourth regiment,
together with brigade headquarters,
will leave, going via tho Hocking Val
ley and Erie to Chicago and the Rock
Island to El Paso. Tho Eighth is due
to leaye Thursday, going by tho
Pennsylvania to St Louis and thence
over the M., K. &. T.
The two brigades of Ohio troops.
when they have been Joined by the
soldiers from Michigan, will consti
tute tho Eleventh division, for which
President Wilson will have to appoint
a major general.
Without giving any reason for tho
faith that is in them, officers of the
several commands that are to leave
this week express the belief that they
are in for six months' service at the
border. The quartermaster's depart
ment Issued orders for ten days'
travel rations to be issued to each
man. This Indicates the outside time
expected to be consumed In the move
ment. Each train will carry a kitchen
car. Of necessity, most of the food
which the men will get en route will
be cold.
The general tone in camp Is dis
tinctly different from that of a week
ago. The men who are to go are happy
and those who have not received
orders to prepare to entrain are hope
ful. The expectation is tiat the
cavalry and probably tho artillery
would move before the First Brigado
and that there would be a movement
of Borne sort every day or two.
A day has been allowed for the
movement of each regiment, for the
reason that there are in camp scarce
ly enough animals to move even one
regimental baggage train. It Is easier
to let the regiments go a day apart
than to hire extra teams at this time
of the year.
Every man under orders to go south
must have a final physical inspection
before being allowed to leave.
The only contingency that Is ex.
pected to stop the present movement
is an immediate declaration of a rail
road strike.

CRISIS IS
ENCOUNTERED
Rail Situation Seems To Have:
Come To Head
Feared Now Negotiations Will
End Without Agreement,
MAY PUT IT UP TO CONGRESS:
President Wilson, If All Efforts Fait
to Bring the Employers and Their
Men Together, Will Go Before tne--Solons
and Ask That They Deal
Wlth the Situation Brotherhood
Committee Leaves Washington.
Washington, Aug. 28. Since Satur
day the belief that negotiations be
tween the railroad executives and.
representatives of the brotherhood,
would end without an agreement has
been growing.
This feeling was strengthened when,
tho members of the brotherhood com
mltteo of G40. tired of their long wait,
departed for home after delegating
their powers to eifect a settlement or
call a strike to a committee of twenty
four. Instructed under no clrcuia
stances to agree to arbitration of the
demand for an eight-hour day at th
present rate of pay for ten hours.
Possibilities of legislation wer
talked over by the president with
Senator Newlands, chairman of the
interstate commerce committee, and'
Secretary Lane. Later the president
made a quiet trip to tiiB senate oificer
building to cgnfer with Senator Kern,
and others.
Whether the plans considered by
President Wilson and his advisers at
the Capitol will be carried out de
pends upon developments, but ft is
understood that if all efforts fail to
bring the employers and their menr
together the president will go before
Congress and ask that it deal with tho
ettuatlon, even If that necessitates in
definitely prolonging the present
session.
Unless the railroad heads recede
from their demand for arbitration or
the eight-hour day proposal, oner
brotherhood heaU said, a , strike af
fecting about 400,000 men will bo
called within the next ten days.
Representatives or both the rail
ways and the brotherhoods held an
other conference with the. president
today. The executives of-.the line
presented the plan to which they
agreed finally Saturday. Its outstand
ing feature Is a demand for arbitra
tion of wages under the eight-hour
day or any day. When they departed
the brotherhood heads acting under
instructions received from the com
mittee of 640 went to the White
House and apprised President Wilson
that they could not accept arbitration
of this feature of their demand and
that In general they stood on his pro
posal, made a week ago, to concede?
the eight-hour principle and arbitrate
the other issues.
