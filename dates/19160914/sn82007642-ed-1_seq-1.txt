'. BY L. D. LOWE.
,' After completing his summer's
work and getting ready tor his
fall hunting, Harrison arose ear
ly ohi) morning and started out
. on his journey across the moun
tains, carrying his flint-lock ri
fle, tomahawk and dirk, with
ample bread and salt for himself
and dogs, and trusting his luck
for a supply of wild meat from
the hunt in the mountains.
: The day was warm, and after
t crossing the numerous ridges
and as many' ravines,; he halted
near the crest of a ridge to take
a Vest; and as his two dogs had
vot had ttie excitement of a chase
during the day, and had only ae-
companies their master in a leis
urely way, they dropped down
nearby and were soon fast asleep,
: but Harrison, with his ever
watchful eye, was looking across
the cove to the top of a ridge a
half mile away, where he discov
ered a dark object moving ar
ound through the weeds. He
could that the animal would
go a short distance, then stop,
and then move on a few yards
and stop again; and from obser-
' vations made in the forests be
fore, he concluded it was a bear.
So he called to his dogs and flan
ked around a knob for the pur
pose of approaching the bear
from the opposite side of the
ridge. After gauging the dis
tance as nearly as he could he be
gan to ascend to the top of the
ridge, making as little noise as
possible and keeping his dogs be
hind him. When he reached the
top of the ridge he looked down
' into the flat below and found the
old bear tearing rotten logs to
pieces nnd two cubs by her side
picking up bugs and other iu
Bects. .
When Harrison discovered the
mother bear and her cubs he
knew that trouble would begin as
noon KB the dogs attacked them.
He discovered a rock ledge about
fifteen feet in height and climbed
to the top of that and told the
dogs to go. Upon the approach
of thedogsthe old bear began
to pop her teeth together and
chase first one dog and then an
' other, while the cubs would run
after their mother, and in turn
ing from one of the dogs to the
'other plie found that she was too
niuch handicapped by her chil
dren; then she began to slap and
box the cubs, like a mother would
chastise a child for some frivo
lous offense, until she made them
underhand that 'their presence
wns inn needed in this engage
ment, niul the cubs ascended
trees out of reach of the dogs.
When the tiinMier saw this was
uixoiUjj. lolied and her cubs were
out of her way, she again turned
on the dogs and while she would
be chasing one the other would
be snapping her from behind,
while Harrison would look on
with intense interest, fearing that
his dogs would be killed, and
would often bo tempted to de
scend from his perch and engage
in the conflict, but he knew that
t this would be risky in case he
came in . close quarters and his
. g in should fail to fire.
Occasionally the bear would
reach out with one of his great
paws and brush one of the dogs,
and, in the meantime, Harrison
was trying to get a shot. Soon
one oi toe aegs ran towards a
large log which was lying across
: sorue other logs wito an open
space between the log and the
' ground, and as the dog was pass
ing under the log , the bear at-
. tempted to cross over it; while in
this position Harrison fired, the
ball striking her spinal column
just in front of the hips, paraly
sing her to some extent, when
tho dogs attacked with greater
Wilson's Record.
Recovering from his surprise
wnen notified that he had been
renominated for the presidoncv
at St. Louis several weeks ago,
President Wilson doubtless real
ized that the campaign now open
ing will not be that avenue of ea
sy success which featured the na
tional contest four years ago.
Even the most ardent Democrat
realizes that with a practically
united Republican party Democ
racy's task this year is greater,
and will require the most careful
and segacious management. Giv
en a fair throw with the dice of
fate, and measured up by what
he has actually accomplished,
The Citizen believes that Presi
dent Wilson should win.
It is in no partisan spirit that
The Citizen speaks of Woodrow
Wilson's 'record of accomplish
ment, nor are we blinded with po
litical enthusiasm in making
that assertion, for the Demo
cratic record" of achievement for
the past three pears speaks for
itself. As the President stated in
his speech of acceptance: "This
extraordinary recital must sound
Ufce a platform, a list of sanguine
promises, but it is not. It is a
record of promises made four
years ago and now actually re
deemed in constructive legisla
tion."
Frequently we note that some
Republican campaign orator sur
prises his hearers by asking what
President Wilson has done. Un
less a man be both blind and
deaf such a question causes
doubts of the speaker's sanity.
In actual legislation and in
prospective enactment the rec
ord of President Wilson is a lu
minous one. The list starts with
the Federal Reserve act and goes
on to the rural Credit bill, the In
come Tax law, the Federal Aid
Commission act, the Clayton bill,
the Good Roads law, the Agri
cultural Educational act, and
the Child Labor bill. We might
mention, too, the Adamson bill
just passed which, while its bene
fits may be doubtful and its wor
kings are yet to be determined,
was at least instrumental in a
verting a strike.
But to return to the Wilson
record. What has been cited a-
bove is not the complete list bv
any means. This countrv today
enjoys the greatest prosperity it
lias ever known; business has
known no panics, and the farm
ers of the nation have taken a
new stand in the financial world.
Do , we want to continue this
prosperity? If we do not.butpre-
tor to return the unsatisfactory
conditions which existed under
Republican rule, we should vote

approaching with his tomahawk
the bear caught one of the dogs
in her arms and wns about to
crusli the life from his body,
when he delivered a heavy blow
upon her arm and she released
the dog and made for Harrison,
but a few strokes from his weap
on brought her to the ground.
When life was extinct he went
to see ahout the cubs and to his
surprise he found that they had
descended from the trees, and
made good their escape into the
laurels.
By this time night was ap
proaching and Hasrison took off
the hide from the lank bear and
found that he had had more ex
perience than profit from h i s
day's hunt.

Thomas JL Edison for Wilson.
New York World.
Thomas A. Edison showed yes-
terday that he is one of the orig
inal T. R. men who will not fol
low the Colonel back into the
Republican camp. He came out
unequivocally in favor of the re
election of President Wilson.
"Not since 18G0," Mr. Edison
said in a formal statement; "has
any campaign made such a di
rect call on simon-pure Ameri
canism. The times are too seri
ous to talk or think in tenns of
Republicanism or Democracy Re
al Americans must drop parties
and get down to big fundamen
tal principles.
"More than any other Presi
dent in my memory, Wilson has
been faced by a succession' of tre-
mendous problems any one of
which, decided the wrong way,
would have had disastrous con
sequences. Wilson's decisions so
far have not got us into serious
trouble, nor are they likely to.
"lie lias given us peace with
honor. This talk about the Uni
ted States being despised is non
sense, fteutrality is a mighty try
ing policy, but back of it are in
ternational law, the rights of
humanity and the future of civi
lization. "With reference to Mexico. I
think that the President has act
ed wisely, justly and courageous
ly. It was right that the United
States should not have recogniz
ed such a murderous personality
aslluerta. I do not believe that
we should have intervened, nor
io I believe that we should inter-
vene now. Mexico is a trouble
some neighborr just now, but
war and conquest is not going
to make her a better one. Both
against England and against hu
man slavery in tho United States
worked out its salvation thru
revolution, and it was a pretty
slow, trying process.
"It has been said that VV ilson
at first was against prepared
ness. Perhaps he was, but when
convinced that intelligent public
opinion was overwhelmingly in
favor of it he changed. That is
the proper thing for ourpresi-
dent to do. A president defiant
of defiant of public opinion would
be a dangerous man in our sys
tem of government.
"His attitude on the tariff
shows an equal openness of mind.
A tariff commission will take the
whole problem out of politics. It
is my hope that experts will be
named, and that the body will
be continuing und vested almost
with the dignity of the Supreme
Court.
"They soy he has blundered.
Perhaps lie has. But I notice
that he usually blunders forward.
lou can tget 100 per cent effi
ciency in a democracy. I don't
know that we ought to want it
We should be machines and we
would have to sacrifice too much
of freedom.
"As I said at the start, it has
been just one big thing after an-
otder with Wilson. I have never
known so many dangerous ques
tions brought up fordecision to
any one President. Now he has
the general strike of the skilled
railway men, which, if carried
out, will throw the whole coun
try into confusion and prove a
calamity that, in certain eventu
alities, will have results bound to
extendovera longperiod of time.
He is acting with his usual cour
age and sanity.
"In my opinion, Mr. Hughes, if
President, would find it difficult
to decide on the best course for
the Government to take in this
strike. His capacity for h i n d
sight, as we learn from his snee
ches, is highly developed, but as
to his foresight we are not equal
ly well informed.
"Mr. Wilson has now had a
Wilsor's Greatest Speech.
Charlotte Observer.
The New Yoik Post which took
a perch on the fence at the be
ginning of the campaign has late
ly given manifestations of un-
easy shifting of position and now
plainly has one leg hanging over
on the Democratic side. Wilson's
speech of acceptance is responsi
ble for this shift in position. We
tan well imagine that The Post
feels more comfortable. The Post
is sure that this speech was be
yond all question, the most bril
liant document he ever penned.
"It is remarkably eloquent."
says The Post, "is free from the
rhetoric which sometimes ham
pers his utterances, is on a high
plane and moves to its points
with a straight-forward clarity
and force which mark it as tho
work of apastmasterofatylennd
a political strategist of the. high
est order.' It is a challenge to put
the Republicans to their trumps.
"Beside it," sayH the Post, "Mr.
Hughes speeches shrink to small
er dimensions than ever, and Mr.
Roosevelt's vituperative bitter
ness appears merely the ravings
of a corner politician." The Post
declares that nothing so far said
or done since this campaign be
gun approaches it. "If M r .
Hughes cannot rise to its breadth
of vision or its power," The Post
thinks, "his will be a difficult
position indeed." But The Post
finds something other than its
brilliancy to admire. Wilson's
speech is ',a staggering broad
side, its force m a large part com
ing from Democratic achieve
ments. The post admits that
rarely if ever in our political his
tory have fio many pre-election
promises been fullilled. Wilson
was right when he said this roll
of party achievements sounds
more like a platform of pledges
than the story of what has been
actually accomplished. "He
might have aded." says T h e
Post, "that if there had been no
critical foreign issues to distract
popular attention, and give a
handle to his adversaries, the
extent of this legislative achieve
ment would be universally recog-
nized. No self-respecting Repub
lican dares in this campaign to
utter the old slander that the old
slander that the Democratic par-
ty is without constructive abili
ty or the power to enact its poli
cies into laws."
The Post stands' in admiration
of the fact that on the foreign is
sues President Wilson yields not
an inch of ground. Confessing to
probable mistakes he yet sticks
to his guns with an aggressive
ness that cannot fail to tell. W e
are-told by The Post that on the
question of what is to come af
ter the war Mr. Wilson's posi
tion "shineH like a planet in the
heavens in contrast with Mr.
Hughes' banal treatment of the
subject." The Post still harbors
some feelings against Wilson Tor
what it terms his "vacillations
and shortcomings in relation to
the European war," but 'weigh
ing this and weighing that, it is
evidently making a motion as if
to let the other lead follow the
first.
bout four years of experience,
and he has earned faith and
trust. I do not think it a logical
or eeusible thing to change to an
unexperienced and untried man
just for the sake of change, or
without much better reasons be
ing given for the change than 1
have noticed.
"Roosevelt was my choice. He
has had experience, and is one of
the best Americans, but the machine-controlled
Republican par
ty would not have, him. There-
! fcro I am for Woodrow Wilson."
Tho Country Boy.
From time immemorial the
country boy has been perted and
(raised as the hope of the na
tion. And he is; but not because
ho is naturally one whit supe
rior to the boy of the city. In
fact the city boy will average up
a little better because of his very
superior advantages. The coun
try boy is the strong man of the
future, not because his vitality is
not sapiied and bis strength de
pleted because of tho tempta
tions rife in urban life but from
which he, out in the rural regions
is practically exempt. Henry W.
Grady said: "The cities produce
very few leaders. Almost every
great man in our history formed
his character in the leisure and
deliberation of our village or
country life, and drew his stren
gth from the drugs of the earth
even as a child draws his from
tho drugs his from his mother's
breast." The country boy lives
where things grow. His life is
natural and free. If he has wise
parents, as mostgreat men have,
lie goes to bed at 0 o'clock and
rises while it is yet dark so as to
feed tho stock before the chickens
can get the corn instead of JJtbe
horses. He does his work in the
day time and gets his sleep at
night. And he merges into man
hood with his physical and men-
tal faculties strong and fresh
and normal. We have no doubt
io tho world that if the city boy
were as regular in his habits and
tool as much healthful exercise
as the boy on the farm he would
be his equal in every respect. The
fact is, we happen to know some
who were reared in the city and
whose fathers and mothers had
sense enough to keep them under
proper control who stand today
at Ihti very fore-front among the
men ot our time. Take as an ex
ample the sons of Rov. J. Henry
Smith. Where on the face of the
earth will you flud a set of boys
who have developed into strong
er or more useful men than the
Smith boys? But old Dr. Smith
had rules for his household that
the children werecompelled to re
spect and obey! Afterall.it is not
the place in which a boy was
reared that fits him for life but
the training he had in his home:
aud it must be confessed that
the countryman has an easier
time controlling his household
than tho city father has. And
herein lies tho differenco between
the city and the country boy.
