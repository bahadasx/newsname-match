"Shoot the Buzzards." The hog
cholera season is here, and the buz
zards help to spread this disease,
so says State Veterinarian Dr. D. F.
Luckey. A few outbreaks of anthrax
have occurred in northern Arkan
sas. This disease is usually prevalent
further south and seldom becomes
widespread as far north as It has
this year. Anthrax Is equally as bad
as hog cholera. Buzzards are likely
to carry anthrax from northern Ar
kansas Into Missouri. Shoot the buz
zards and burn them! Buzzards are
menace to live stock production,
aud therefore should be killed and
burned. "Shoot the Buzzards!"
It Is often said that a man can not
pay rent on corn land and get out
even on the deal. E. T. Stubblngton,
living nine miles northwest of Cen
tralia, tells the editor of the Centra
lia Guard that he had rented fifty-
three acres of his land at $5.00 per
acre and thirty-five acres at $6.00
per acre, the rental bringing him
$485.00. This land was rented to
M. Stublngton's neighbors and the
crops are estimated to be worth at
leaRt $2,000.00, This gives Mr. Stub-
Ington practically $500 in rent and
the routers will receive $1,500 or

Milk bearing the stamp of approv
al by those in authority is not a
guarantee that it wilt keep whole
some if not Dronerlv cared for In the
home or retail shop. ' Containers
should be thouroughly sterilized and
carefully dried; milk should be kept
cold and at regular temperature, and
should also be kept covered; milk
absorbs odors very readily and should
be kept free from contaminating in
fluences. Walter White, a fruit grower of
Irvington township, Nashville, 111.,
has made $24,000 from his peach or
chard of 40 acres this year, it is
said. His expenses were $4,000, net-
! ting him $20,000. Last year his net
profit was $10,000. He has raised
good peach crops for four consecu
tive years. White has a process of
spraying which delays the maturing
of the peaches for two weeks. Let us
on t 'hat secret in Audrain, won't
you?
"Does a hen get too fat to lay?"
It Is observed that this question
should be reversed , and instead of
saying the hen gets too fat to lay,
we should say the hen can't lay Is
' ,eu rauoii wmcn mas.es ten
yolks for each five whites, she will
make only five eggs and the other
five yolks are taken back into the
hen'8 8-V8ten 8nd buiIt into fat-
In
this way she becomes very fat, yet
produces only a few eggs. In this
case the hen is not at fault, for if alio
had been given a balauced ration,
she would have manufactured eggs
instead of fat. A good example of a
mistake of this kind is permitting
hens to eat with fattening hogs. We
often hear farmers say that the hens
waste the Teed. They are right so
far as egg production is concerned,'
for a ration which is good for fat-
toning hogs Is not good for laying
hens. . The reason Is that the ra
tion produces more yolks than
whites and therefore the hens get
fat iustead of producing eggs.

RURAL SCHOOLS
By V. Clyde V. Johnson.
At last 1 have caught up with the
all but unending office work and am
able to get out and see how the
schools are getting along.
Wednesday I attended the conven
tion of the Christian Churches of the
county at Vandalla and also the
school. It was their record day. The
enrollment Is good and everything is
starting off well. M. C. Thomas
seems to be a very thoro and capable
school man. I shall have something
more to say about the school later.-
Thursday morning I stopped for a
few minutes at Bear Slough. Miss
Beatrice McNiel, teacher. She had
six pupils who were very proud of
the 12 new desks that have lately
been put in.
At Prairie Hill, Miss Geneva Cris
wcll, teacher. They report 24 pu
pils, 9 in the "Y" Class. They are
keeping the dust down by the use of
a sweeping compound.
Pleasant Plains had 32 pupils,
with Miss Erie Kirtley as teacher.
Hall had a new concrete platform
in front of th door. Maps and black
boards have been ordered.
There were 11 pupils at HiGkory
Grove. Miss Atha Gregg is again the
teacher. The heater has been en
ameled and shines like new. We shall
hear of additional improvements
later.
Miss Blanche Sipple is the teacher
at Cauthorn. She has 23 pupils. A
sweeping compound has been order
ed. School has not begun at Edwards.
Miss Blanche Brooks is the teacher.
The well was cleaned out There
were about 25 beer bottles, thanks
to those who travel the State high
way, found in it. I also noticed a
new concrete platform, a walk to the
well, a concrete top for the well, a
drain for the water away from the
welt, a new roof, and a new fence.
They have been busy in weell-dolng.
Eureka, with Miss Alma Brown,
teacher for the fourth consecutive
term is still growing. This year she
has 24 pupils, twice what she had
the first year.
At Prairie Chapel the stove has
been moved back to the corner of the
room. A new fence has been built on
two sides. Miss Ruth Miller Is the
teacher. She had seven pupils, just
enough to have a very interesting
game of hall since the teacher takes
part herself.
Again E. E. Shay
is principal at
Benton City. ;le had
22 pupils, and
the primary
term has 28.
Miss Moore, who is
teacher for the third
They have a new organ which the
school is paying for. They will have
an ice cream supper next Saturday
night to help in this matter. Kelier
hal Brothers have made each room
a present of a very useful and help
ful pencil sharpener. Swings have
been put up under the frees and are
very much enjoyed by all. The floors
have rteen oiled.
I was very much disappointed not
to find any of the floors of the ru
ral schools oiled, as this is a very
necessary step In keeping down the
dust, preventing disease and making
for the general health of the chil
dren. But I believe that some will
yet be oiled. Not a town school this
year that will not be oiled. If it is
worth while for the town children,
then why not for the country chil
dren? All the weeds bad beeu cut and
the houses cleaned and scrubbed.
Several have already ordered equip
ment, some are going to have a sup
per, and all are doing something to
make their school homes as comfort
able as possible.
Erisman had a big ice cream sup
per last Friday night. A large crowd
was present and a good time was en
Joyed by all present.
Stauffer had a supper last Wed
nesday night and South Liberty has
already had a supper and are plan
ning a Parents' Day soon.
John Francis of Monroe county
