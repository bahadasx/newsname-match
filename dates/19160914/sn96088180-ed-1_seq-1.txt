RUSS-JAP 1ATT
S ACCEPTABLE TO
0 STATES
Washington, Sept. 14. Unofficial
opinion expressed at the state depart-
uieut today by those following the
Russo-Japanese treaty was to the ef
fect that the assurances of the Japan
ese foreign office regarding the treaty
received at the department of state
last night were satisfactory to this
government. The definiteness and
openness of the Japanese memoran
dum to Ambassador Gutbrle made a
favorable Impression here. The only
question remaining Is whether or not
there may be secret clauses. Officials
said they dad nothing to base such a
ibellef on and that in view of the ex-
ptlcltnes of the Japanese statement
there appeared to tie no further ne
cessity for further discussion of the
matter.

Japanese foreign office regarding
Japan's adherence to the "open door"

"The Imperial government desires

provisions of article 2 of the convic

Russia of July ll, 107, nor have the
Imperial government entertained for
from the policy to which they have
avowedly committed themselves re-
' spelling the maintenance of the Inde
pendence and territorial Integrity of
China as well as the equal oppor
tunity for the trade of all nations In
that country.1
"On the contrary they are as
strongly convinced as ever of the use
fulness of that policy In the Interests
of the general stability In the far
east, which they have always very
near their heart.

125 CITIES . SEEK
U.S. II PLATE
Washington. Sept 14. With con
clusion of arguments by representa
tives of 123 cities that want the gov
ernment armor plate plant expected
tonight or tomorrow, the navy general
board has decided to visit a majority
of the sites proposed.
Some of the cities, it was stated,
will necessarily have to be abandoned
at the start, because sites suggested
do not come within that section of
the law which provides that the plant
must be located "with special refer
ence to safety In time of war."
That section, all members of the
general board questioned today said,
will be the principal issue Involved In
the location of the plant that will
mean employment to many thousands
of men and a payroll of many hun
dred thousands. . -Other
important constderaiivos.
such as availability of raw material,
transportation facilities, etc., will be
waived, if necessary to meet the pro
vision.
The United Press learned today
from an authoritative source that the
following big factors must be consid
ered in deciding on' a location:
Cost of land forsite.
Availability of raw materials
Condition of labor market ,
Transportation facilities, with the
matter of bridges to be crossed or
tunnels on the lines to shipbuilding
plants, is a factor of first importance.
