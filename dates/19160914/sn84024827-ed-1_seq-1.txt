NEW LONDON. Sept 13 Sugges
tions as to what methods shall be em
ployed to establish peace on the Mex
ican border were submitted today to
Major General Tasker H. Bliss, by the
American members of the American-
Mexican joint commission. The offi
cer's ODtnion to the possibility of
creating an International police to
guard the border. No conclusion,
however, was reached and the com
missioners will continue their confer
ences with General Bliss tomorrow.
Mining Laws Discussed.
The JVint commission dealt wholly
today with the question raised by the
decrees issued by General Carranza
which affect American controlled min
ing properties in Mexico. An ex
haustive study of the situation was
begjn. The Mexican commissioners
explained in detail the purposes of the
decrees, insisting that they were de
signed to promote the mining indus
try, not tt) drive out American capital
and confiscate their holdings.
General Bliss Consulted.
In brief conferences with General
Bliss the American commissioners
took under advisability a proposal of
such a system of border patrol that
a part of the Mexican troops now en
gaged in thus duty would be released
i'jr duty at a distance from the line.
They considered also the position
of Americans living along the border,
as reported by General Bliss and ob
tained from that officer estimates as I
to the number of soldiers necessary
to put into effect any of the plans
suggested.
Discussing the wider aspects of the
commission's Work, Secretary Lane
said tonight it was probably unique
in tie history of the international
bodies in that it was going into all
that concerned the life of a nation;
its economic conditions, its political
struggles and its plans of govern
ment Even the internatfonal responsibili
ties of Mexico were being taken over,
and it was reported that all the points
had been, considered in order that
enduring government should be set
up. Complaints of American mining
interests in Mexico led to the pres
ent investigation.
Mine Rule Explained.
In explaining the features com
plained of, the Mexican commissioners
pointed ut that one of the aims of
the Carranza government was to pre
vent speculative and unproductive
monopolization of mining lands. The
Carranza government, it was said, vir
tually has reversed the system in
operation during the Diaz government
I'nder the Diaz plan the rate of tax
ation on mining claims diminished In
direct ratio to the number of claims,
whereas under the Carranza plan the
purpose is to encourage the staking
of a relatively small number of
claims which actually are to be oper
ated and to discourage the holding
of large tracts of mining land simply
for speculative purposes.
Mexican Money Discussed.
Another series of complaints had
to do with the attempt tf the Carran
za government to compel merchants
and corporations to accept paper
currency at a rate far in excess of its
current value. The attention of the
Mexican commissioners was directed
to instances in which the military
commanders, through decrees, threat
ened with death any person who re
fused to accept paper currency at Its
par value, and ftr a similar offence
also had threatened merchants with
the confiscation of their property.
The Mexican commissioners pointed
out that in so vast a country it was
humanly impossible to guard against
possible abuses, but they laid stress
on the fact that though decrees might
be promulgated by certain military
commanders, the central government
has always urged moderation, but
there was not a single record where
any of these penalties had been car
ried out.
GREECE SWERVING
TO ALLIES SIDE.
LONDON, Sept. 14. (1:30 a.
m.) Athens dispatches say that
the former minister of justice,
M. Dimitracoupulos, after reach
ing an understanding with the
king, will put his views before
the entente minister and let
their attitude determine whether
he will accept the premiership.
M. Dimitracoupulos, the dis-
patches add, is of the opinion
that Greece's departure from
neutrality is the only remedy
for the present international
situation. It is reported that M.
Dragounil.s, formerly minister at
Petrograd, will be foreign min-

CHICAGO, Sept 13. Sweeping vic
tories for Governor Edw. F. Dunne,
Democrat and former congressman
Frank O. Lowden, Republican, for
their respective parties' nomination
for governor and the apparent defeat
of former senator Wm. Lorimer for
congressman, characterized the pri

indicated the nomination of Governor
Dunne over Wm. Brinton by a plurali

three fourths of Cook County in,
Dunne had a plurality of 43,000 in
Cook County. He was running t'o to
one over Brinton down state. Low
den's plurality over Morton D. Hull of
Chicago in the Republican fight was
also large.
Lorimer Likely Beaten
On' the face of incomplete returns
from the sixth congressional district

DOUGLAS, Sept. 13. The failure
of Mess Sergeant Rogers, II Company,
and Private Frank E. MarKay, Com
pany E, Second Montana Infantry, to
return to the regimental camp today,
coupled with indefinite rumors that
they had been killed by Mexican sol
diers while in Sonora, caused intense
excitement in the Montana camp, two
miles west of Douglas, tonight. Offi
cers and men, from Colonel Donohue
to the privates, used every effort to
find some trace of the men and their
movements.
MacKay enlisted in Saco, Montana,
and Rogers in Kalispell. Private
O'Brien, Company H, brought the
first report of the men's disappear
ance and probable violent end to the
camp early today. A quiet investiga
tion was conducted by regimental of
ficers until late in the day when the
news leaked out.
O'Rrien said tonight that he, Mac
Kay and Rogers were to have gone
with a Mexican half breed to see an
old placer mine which the Mexican
claimed contained very rich ground,
but he was personally prevented from
accompanying the party by military
duties. The two soldiers, dressed in
civilian clothing and the Mexican

With Hunt leading Olney by 123S
votes in thirty-five out of. fifty-two
and with, but two close races vet la
consider, the bi-annual primary has
come and gone. Many are the condi
dates who now wish thy had never
put their political heads on the chop
ping b'ock. There are still others who
made better in their races than they,
or their friends, anticipated. Some
sore spots exist but from prtser indi
cations a strong Democratic P?rty -will
face the election in Novenbr with,
no qualms and no doubts.
Seventeen precincts are ret to be
heard from in Cochise county. la
most cases they are small and could
not change the result in br two In
stances, the- race for the senatorial
nomination and that for the seventh
place on the representative ticket.
Roberts Is leading Riggs by th!rty-on
votes. The outside may give Riggs
the lead but. inasmuch as several of
the precincts may be forecasted for
Roberts, this is not expectei.
In the case of the race for the s"v
enth place on the ticket for the lower
Frank J. Vaughan has the lead over
John S. Merrill of twenty ot?. Mer
rill, in turn, is ahead of Francis by
one vote. AH of the seventeen pre
cincts 'o be heard from are in the
outlying districts. Merrill, who lives
in St. David, and who is an old-tia?
in the county, may wrest the seventh
place away from the Bisbee man. who
is not so well known In the country
precincts. In other words both Vaug
han and Francis have polled their hea
vy votes, while Merrill may be ex
pected to beat both in the rerua-'u'rg
orevlnrts to be heaid from.
The big surprise of the primary
came in the race for the nomination
for sheriff. Though many expected
Harry Wheeler to win. they did not
expect the present officer to be nomi
nated by a majority. Jimmle McDon
ald and Sara Hayhurst. together, poll
ed 2149 votes. Wheeler has already
received 2245. Hayhurst failed to
win in Douglas. McDonald, even, beat
ing him there, with Wheeler leading.
McDonald A-on in the Warren District
and In Lowell precinct by a few votes.
Wheeler took every other precinct in
the county by big majorities.
Another surprise was sprung in the
race between Krebs and Ivey for th
nomination for county recorder. Two
years ago when Owen Murphy was
renominated for the office, Ivey ran
second and Krebs third.
Sparks and Rock are again the Dera
ocratic nominees for supervisors.
Sparks leads Rock by something over
100 votes. Adams was third. Taylor
fourth and Westfield fifth.
