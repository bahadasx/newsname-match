TAXATION DECREES
Amarican-Mexican Joint Commission
Begin an Exhaustive Study of the
Taxation Decrees Issued by General
Carranza Which Affect American
Controlled Mining Properties in
Mexico, and All That Concern the
Life of Mexico; Its Economic Prob
lems; Its Political Struggles and
Every Phase of Government.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 13.—
Suggestions as to what methods shall
be employed to establish peace on the
Mexican border were submitted today
to MaJ. Oen. Tasker H. Bliss, U. S. A.,
by the American members of the
American-Mexican Joint commission.
The officer's opinions were sought on
subjects ranging from the withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico to
the possibility of creating an inter
national police to guard the border.
No conclusion, however, was reached
and the commlasloners will continue
their conferences with General Bliss
tomorrow.
The Joint commission today dealt
wholly with questions raised by tax
ation decrees issued by General Car
ranza, which affect American-con
trolled mining properties. An ex
haustive study of the situation was
begun. The Mexican commissioners
explained in detail the purposes of
the decrees, insisting that they were
designed to promote the mining indus
try, not to drive out American capital
and confiscate its holdings.
Discussing the wider aspects of the
commission's work, Secretary Lane
said tonight it was .probably unique
in the hiBtory of international bod
ies, in that it was going into all that
concerned the life of a nation; its
economic problems; its political strug
gles and every phase of government.
It was possible, he said, that no
conclusions would be reached as to
many of the things discussed. He
added, however, that the Mexicans
would have knowledge of the views
held In the United States as a result
of the deliberations, while the Ameri
can commissioners were gleaning a
wide knowledge of conditions below
the border.
Even the international responsibili
ties were being talked over, Mr. lame
said, and it was necessary that all
these things should be considered in
order that an enduring government
should be set up in the distressed re
public. Complaints of American min
ing interests In Mexico led to the
present investigation. In explaining
the decrees complained of, the Mexi
can commissioners pointed out that
one of the aims of the Carranza gov
ernment was to prevent speculative
and unproductive monopolization of
mining claims.
Under the Diaz regime the rate of
taxation on mining claims diminished
in direct ratio to the number of
claims, whereas under Carranza the
purpose is to encourage the staking
of a relatively small number of
claims which actually will be oper
ated and to discourage the holding of
large tracts of mining land simply for
speculative purposes.
Another series of complaints had to
do with the attempt of the Carranza
government to compel merchants and
corporations to accept paper currency
at a rate far in excess of its current
value. The attention of the Mexican
commissioners .was directed to in
stances in which military command
ers had. through decrees, threatened
with death any person who refused to
accept paper currency at its par value,
and for a similar offense also had
threatened merchants with the con
fiscation of their property.
The Mexican commissioners pointed
out that in so vast a country It was
humanly impossible to guard against
all possible abuses, but they laid em
phasis on the fact that while such
extreme decrees had been issued by
subordinate military commanders, the
national government had constantly
urged moderation on the state govern
ors and that they had no record of a
single instance in which any of these
extreme penalties had been inflicted.
VISITING FROM SPOKANE.

dren autoed from Spokane in their

MEETING MAHKED
Bf ENTHUSISM
DEMOCRATIC COUNTY CENTRAL
COMMITTEE MEETS FOR PUR
POSE OF ORGANIZING.
LA9IES TO SERVE OR COMMITTEE
The democratic central committee
of Fergus county held a meeting Sat
urday, and while the purpose of the
meeting was to elect officers of that
organization, a number of old-time
democrats and the candidates were in
attendance. From the drop of Chair
man Martin's gavel calling the meet
ing to order until adjournment, en
thusiasm reigned, and instead of the
usual, old-fashioned formal affair, the
meeting was marked with enthusiastic
outbursts of optimistic expressions.
Something New
The central committee initiated a
new precedent by designating the can
didates as a committee to select the
men they desired, to conduct their cam
paign. This innovation proved ex
tremely popular and was well received.
After retiring from the whole com
mittee and getting the views of each
candidate they made the recommen
dation that T. M. Shaw of Becket be
elected chairman; J. E. Lane, vice
chairman; R. S. Zahniser, secretary,
and F. IL Hazen, treasurer. The cpm
mlttee immediately ratified these se
lections, and further authorized the
executive committee to appoint an as
sistant secretary.
Executive Committee.
The question of selection of the ex
ecutive committee of the central com
mittee was next taken up and for
the first time in the political history
of Fergus county several ladies were
selected as members of that commit
tee. This distinction was given Mrs.
N. J. Littlejohn and Mrs. John A. Cole
man. The other members of the com
mittee were: John A. Cox of Roy,
John Weidenborner of Moore, Mike
Harney of Benchland, R. E. Cox of
Coffee Creek, James Stafford of Wini
fred, John B. Ritch of Lewistown, V.
F. Dusek of Lewistown, Tom Stout of
Lewistown and David Hilger of Lewis
town.
Attorney J. E. Wasson of Hilger was
tendered the office of state central
committeeman but in a fitting and
characteristic speech declined that
honor and suggested the name of F.
R. Cunningham who was elected by
acclamation.
OFFICIALS HERE.

perintendent of the Puget Sound lines
of the Milwaukee, E. H. Barrett of

FERGUS GOES TO
SECOND CEASS
Friday morning the county com
missioners took up the question of the
proper classification of Fergus county
and it was learned that the assessed
valuation had reached such an amount
It would be necessary to advance front
a third to a second class county. The
new classification will become effec
tive the first Monday in January, 1917.
Under the new classification the
salaries of all county officers with
the exception of the commissioners,
county attorney and sheriff will be
increased. An increase will also be
given the chief deputies in some of
the offices. The deputy county attor
ney received the highest increase, or
$300 per year. All other elective of
ficers, with the exception of those be
fore named, will receive an advance
of $250 per annum.
The entire afternoon was devoted to
road matters, and when five o'clock
came the September session closed.
DON WADE RETURNS.
Don Wade of the First National
bank returned Friday from a two
weeks' visit at his old home in Grand
Rapids, Mich. Mr. Wade's return trip
was filled with exciting incidents,
chief of which was being a passenger
on the Olympian, which was wrecked
Thursday morning about 3:15 fifty
miles east of the Montana-Dakota line,
near Bowman, N. D. Recent rains had
softened the roadbed causing the en
gine to leave the track, seriously in
juring both the engineer and fireman.
A delay of seven hours ensued, during
which time Mr. Wade secured some
excellent photographs of the wrecked
engine.

J
MAN SUPPOSED TO BE W. C. BALL
EXPIRES WHILE WAITING FOR
A PRESCRIPTION.
BURSTEO BLOOD VESSEL THE CAUSE
Between S:,'I0 and 3 o'clock Friday
evening a man aged between 45 and
50 years, weighing annul 100 pounds
died in the lavatory of the King-Fessel
pharmacy. Positive identification was
impossible but lie is presumed to be
M. C. or W. C. Ball of Judith Gup.
Shortly before 8;30 Ball called at
the office of Dr. J. P. Dunn and dur
ing the course of the examination in
formed the doctor he was suffering
severe pains. The doctor discovered
unusuully high blood pressure, ami
the patient told of former kidney
troubles.
After the examination Dr. Dunn
wrote a prescription, and accompanied
Bali to the pharmacy where he left
him while he went to call upon other
patients. While waiting for the pre
scription to be filled, Mr. Ball com
plained of a nauseous feeling and
asked that lie be directed to a lava
tory that he might vomit. One of
the clerks directed him to the lavatory
in the rear of the store, returning to
the front and when Ball did not re
turn within a reasonable length of
time the clerk returned to the lava
tory to find him in an apparent faint.
The clerk at once tried to communi
cate with Dr. Dunn but wns unable to
locate him. l)r. Flynn, who has been
assisting Dr. Dunn for some time, re
sponded to the call and after his ex
uminatlon pronounced Ball dead.
While no examination was made, it
is presumed that death resulted front
a bursted blood vessel caused by the
strain of vomiting.
TRAFFIC
STOPPED
Night Travel in Gotham
Completely Paralyzed
by the Car Strike.
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.—The fail
are of Mayor Mitehel and the public
service commission today to induce
street railway officials to arbitrate
differences with their employes, found
this city tonight still in the grip of
the transit strike, now in its sixth
day. Suspension of traffic on all sur
face car lines in Manhattan and the
Bronx at night and infrequent service
during the duy has packed subway and
elevated lines and caused great in
convenience to the traveling public.
Mayor Mitchel's plan to have the
board of estimates grant a franchise
to tiie New York Motor Bus company,
permitting omnibus traffic throughout
the city, did not give much hope to
night, as it takes 30 days for the fran
chise to be granted and to put buses
in operation.
William B. Fitzgerald, organizer of
of the car men's union, tonight ac
cused Theodore P. Shouts of the In
terborough Rapid Transit company,
of fearing defeat by bis refusal to ar
bitrate the strike.
Samuel Gompers and other labor
leaders wil laddress a mass meeting
tomorrow after a parade of the strik
ing car men, who will march to refuto
the assertion of railway officials that
the number of men union leaders de
clare are on strike is exaggerated.
STOCK SHOW 10 LEWISTOWN MAT
AFFORD OCTOBER KTTIMCTION
It looks as though Lewistown would
be chosen as a place for exhibition
of shorthorn cattle by the Montana
Purebred Livestock association this
fall. The amount asked by this asso
ciation for making a one-day show
here with an auction following is reas
onable enough to be considered by
the Chamber of'fommerce. It has been
suggested that an effort be made to
get this stock show here in October
and combine it with enough other
county fair features to make it worth
while.
WE GET SOME ATTENTION.
The Northwestern Motorist for Aug
ust contains an article upon a monster
Spring creek trout with a picture of
said trout to prove that it's not merely
a fish story. This splendid catch
measures 34 % inches in length and
weighs 15% pounds. The catch was
made in Lewistown last year.
The same magazine contains an ar
ticle on the state association of com
mercial secretaries and is illustrated
by a group photograph of a few of the
members in which Secretary Blodgett
is prominently figured.
WANT NEW SCHOOL DISTRICT.
County Superintendent Baker was
holding a hearing Saturday on the
petition for the creation of a new

After Being Elected United States
Senator as a Republican Six Years
Ago, Miles Poindexter of Washing
ton Joined the Progressive Party
Four Years Ago, and the Reaction
ary Republicans Attempted to De
feat His Renomination by Running
Congressman Will E. Humphrey
Against Him.
SEATTLE, Sept. 13.- United States
Senator Miles Poinuexter, who wus
elected as a republican six years ago
and who joined the progressive party
four years ago, was renominated as
the republican candidate for senator
in yesterday's primary election, de
feating Will E. Humphrey, now repre
sentative in congress front the First
district, by a plurality of first choice
votes estimated ut 7,0n0. Humphrey's
campaign managers had counted on a
much larger plurality in King county
than he was able to obtain, and bis
small pluralities in other lumber coun
ties and the adverse majority of Pierce
county were a surprise to them.
Henry McBride of Seattle, who was
governor of the state from 1901 to
1905, was nominated as the republican
candidate for governor, with first and
second choice votes. He received a
very large plurality in King county.
McBride was a lender of the progres
sive party four years ago.
Lieut. Gov. Louis F. Hart, republi
can, appears to have been renomin
ated, and Mrs. Josephine ('. Preston,
state superintendent of instruction,
also seems to have been successful.
Incomplete returns point to the nom
ination of W. W. Sherman for state
treasurer on the republican ticket.
Other republican nominations arc;
Secretary of state, I. M. Howell;
auditor, C. W. Clausen; insurance
commissioner, H. O. Fish back; land
commissioner, Clark V. Savldge; at
torney general, W. V. Tanner.
The democratic vote was small ow
ing to. lack of contests. George Tur
ner, former United States senator, ap
pears to have been nominated for sen
ator over Robert Bridges. The other
democratic nominees, there being op
position to none except Governor Lis
ter, and that only nominal, are:
Governor, Ernest Lister; secretary
of state, M. Tadlock; treasurer,
George J. Galvin; insurance commis
sioner, J. H. Hamer; school superin
tendent, J. H. Morgan; lieutenant gov
ernor, Thomas Lally.
There were no nominees for audi
tors, land commissioner and attorney
general on the printed ballot, but the
official count probably will show many
names written in.
Supreme Judges Emmet N. Parker,
Mark A. Fullerton and George E. Mor
ris, non-partisan, were renominated.
Their names wil) go on the Novem
ber ballot ahead of those of Edgar G.
Mills and Charles E. Claypool, who
polled smaller votes than the judges.
For the short term on the supreme
bench J. Stanley Webster received a
majority over Elihu F. Barker, and
Webster's name will go on tile No
vember ballot unopposed. Meantime
he probably will be appointed to the
bench to succeed Justice Frederick
Bailsman, who desires to resign in a
few days.
In the First district John F. Miller,
ex-muyor of Seattle, received the re
publican nomination for congress, de
feating State Senator Dan Landon,
progressive republican and eight other
candidates. George F, Cotterlll, ex
mayor of Seattle, got the democratic
nomination unopposed.
In the Second district Representa

merly a progressive member of the
legislature, was named on the demo
cratic ticket.
In the Third district. Representative

conta. The democratic nomination
went to G. P. Fishburne, unopposed.
In the Fourth district, W. L. La

and C. W. Masterson received the
democratic nomination.
In the Fifth (Spokane) district, Tom
Corkery is leading In the race for the

CHICAGO, Sept. 13.—Former Con
gressman Frank O. Lowden of Oregon,
111., and Governor Edward F. Dunne,
incumbent were nominated by large
pluralities for governor by the republi
cans and democrats, respectively, in
.the Illinois primaries today, according
to estimates based on incomplete re
turns tonight.
Lowden seems to have carried Chi
cago by plurality of 40,000 over Mor
ton D. Hill of Chicago, second man.
Down-state returns indicated a heavy
plurality for Lowden. Estimates from
the entire state put Lowden's plural
ity at more than 150,000.
j Dunne apparently carried Chicago

by more than 70,000 and is running on

EVENTFUL
CONGRESS
Adjournment Occurs on
Scheduled Time With
out Hitch in Plans.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8—Adjourn
ment of the first session of the sixty
flourth congress at 10 o'clock Ibis
morning without a hitch in the plans
of senate and house leaders wus quick
ly followed by a general exodus of
members hastening homeward for rest
or the national political campaign.
While the closing saw Hie adminis
tration legislative program mainly
completed, some things wail to lie con
tinued ut the winter session, notably
the remainder of the president's pro
gram on railroad legislation, which
wus partially enacted to prevent the
threatened strike.
In a formal statement President
Wilson, speaking of the work of con
gress, gave notice that the remainder
of the railroad program would he
pressed ut the new session. His slate
meat follows:
"A very remarkable session of con
gress has just closed, full, as all re
cent sessions of congress huve been,
of helpful and humane legislation
which constitutes contributions of
capital importance to the defense, the
economic progress and the whole life
of the country.
"It is lo he regretted that the ses
sion could not have continued long
enough to complete the program re
cently projected with regard to the
accomodation of labor disputes be
tween the railways and the employes,
but it wus not feasible in the cir
cumstances to continue tlm session
any longer and therefore only the
most immediately pressing parts of
the program could he completed.
"The rest, it is agreed, lias been
merely postponed milII it can be mu
turely deliberated and perfected. I
have every reason to believe that it
is the purpose of the leaders of the
two houses immediately upon rous
semhling congress, to undertake tills
additional legislation. It is evident
that the country should be relieved
of tlm anxiety which must have been
created by recent events with regard
to the future accomodation of such
disputes."
Tlm immigration bill, the corrupt
practices hill and the bill to permit
combinations of American exporters
to meet foreign competition abroad
went over.
Tlm closing hours of congress were
remarkably quiet. Only the presence
of the president in his room near the
senate chamber served to attract in
terest to what would otherwise have
been an uneventful ending of an event
fill congress.
Informal conferences of a few ad
ministration senators and congressmen
turned after adjournment from
thoughts of what had been achieved
to contemplation of the future. No
matter what happened in the Novem
ber election the democratic congress
has three months of work ahead and
an ambitious program to complete,
WORK ACCOMPLISHED.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8—The first
session of the sixty-fourth congress

ASSOCIATED PRESS RE8UME.
The French north of Pcronue are
holding tenaciously to the salient they
have driven Into the German line east
of the llethiine-Peronne road near Bou
chavesnes. They hold intact, too, the
town or Houchavesnes and other points
along the line captured in the offens
ive started Tuesday. Their rapture
of a powerfully organized German
trench system south of the Lel'riez
farm, near the road running from
Huncourt to UombleB has put Combles
in further Jeopardy. Fighting in tho
region of lloiiclmvesiies has been san
guinary. Finding that the French had
cut their line of communication from
Peronne northward the Germans threw
violent attacks against I'Abhe wood
und Hill 76, south of Bouchavesnes
und retook both places. The French,
however, returned viciously to the at
tack and after hard lighting Anally
drove out tho Germans and kept the
ground they had won. In the two
days' lighting more than 2,300 Germans
were taken prisoners and a large num
ber of guns and machine guns cap
lured.
On the British Somme front the
situation remains unchanged. South
