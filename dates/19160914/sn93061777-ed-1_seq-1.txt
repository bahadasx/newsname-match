the country in arreat shape for

There's a reason for this. It's

Farwell and Parmer
County Goes Dry
At the election held in Farwell
and Parmer County last Satur
day, the county went dry by an 1
overwhelmirg prohibition vote.
A total of 143 votes were polled,
125 for pre hibition and 18
agaimt it. The vote in Farwell
was 65 for prohibition ar.d 8
against it.
Partner County has heretofore
bef n in the wet column, although
there were no saloons. The
Texico salootw have maintained
warehouses in Farwell and
shipped their liquor to Farwell
instead of Texico because of a
much lower freight rate.
Since Parmer County has gone
dry it will be against the law to
ship booze into the county, and
the warehouses will have to
move to Texico or abandoned.
It is claimed the Parmer
County election shows the great
est percentage the pros have
ever recorded in any county in
Texas over their opposition,

NEW HOMESTEAD LAW
DID NOT PASS THE SENATE
Amendments Held Bill
Will Become a
Late dispatches from Wash
ington state that the homestead
act has not become a law as was
erroneously stated in the dis
patches at the time congress ad
journed. The bill passed the house of
representatives same weeks ago
and was before the senate on
the last day of the session.
Amendments to some of its pro
visions were made in the senate
before it was placed on final
passage, but the measure was
adopted too late for the amend
ments to be acted upon by the
loAer house when the hour ot
adjournment arrived.
in consequence of this situa
tion, the bill will come up before
the next session of congress in
December, where its passage is
assured as there are oniy a few
minor details in which '.here is a
difference between the senate
and the house.
This postponement of action
will not impair the value oi the
proposed relief to: the settlers
nor hamper them to any extent
as during the late months of the
year there is a relatively small
amount of filing on the public
domain. As soon as the meas
ure becomes law, the president
will determine what lands shall
be open to settlement under its
provisions and as the general
land office and the interior de
partment have been confident of
the ultimate passage of the act,
much of the preliminary work in
this direction has 'already been
accomplished.
the various villages and inland
towns of Curry County was dis
cussed and it seemed to be the
opinion of ull tuat such organiza
tions should be maue, whereupon
it was determined that parties
go to Melrose Wednesday and to
Texico Thursday for the purpose
of such organization.

their names in membership and
