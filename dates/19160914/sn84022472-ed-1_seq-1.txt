health forbidding the sale in that, city
of milk witf a certain bacterial count.
, Extensive, plans have been formu
'f lated. by the prime movers in the or

the main reason for. their contemplat
ed action is based on the belief that

ers will be obliged to sell the milk
"to the two large corporations which
have pasteurization plants, and, in
that manner the price will be dictat
ed by the corporations. By building

graded, the cost will be lessened and

venturesome exploits of motor truck
drivers lnthe United States army ser
vice, Frederick W. Beardsleyrwho has
beertyan assistant trucknriraster in the

port last night. -
Beardsley brought to the Locomo
bile Co. of America, which has been
busy turning out Riker trucks for use
on the border, the details of the latest,
and perhaps the crowing achievement
of Riker trucks, a run of over 800
miles,, from Columbus,' N.' M., to, San
Antonio, . Tex., in 17 days.
The record making run was through
territory without any vestige of road
way, with the single- exception of a
stretch 30 miles oUt. The fact ( that
the run averaged better than 66 miles
a day is, regarded, as .little short of
phenomenal. . That the train was
made up of Riker trucks alone, 3i of
them, carrying all the supplies for men
and, machines, is a source of elation
LEGAL ACTION NEARLY CAUSES
CLOSING OF HUNTINGTON FAIR
v GROUND GATES AGAINST PUBLIC
Early comers' at the Huntington
air, which opened- its gates this morn
ing, were unaware how close they
were to seeing little of the argicul
tural exhibits at close - range, for
threatened litigation which resulted in
a change Of ownership all but tied up
the , project with an Injunction.
As a result of hasty conferences be
ween the former partners, Herbert P.
Moon, of Fairfield, and Charles B.
Weed, of this city, bankers, and At
torneys Chamberlain & Hull, a trans
fer, of all Interest in (the fair ground
property was made to Moon and the
Huntington Fair association proceeded
with its show.,. i'
Behind the incidents which result
established in 1878 under the name
of the Union Agricultural association,
is said to lie a story of foresight and
speculation which hardly has an equal
in this section during the decade.
The Union " Agricultural fair had
flourished during the heyday of fairs.
Its race course trotted the best horses
of the country, state, and Eastern cir
cuit, including some owned by Owen
J. Keemtn of this city, who was later
a part owner in the track with Thom
as Morrissey and Dr. , Edmund War
ren, all known for their "steppers."
During the late 80's interest flagged
in racing and farmers exhibited their
produce and stock esewhere. In 19.05

BRIDGEPORT'S MILK "ROTTEN"
. FINDING OF BACTERIOLOGIST,
?- HFTER COMPLETING HIS TEST
. ; . . .
After four days test of samples of
milk , furnished fto Bridgeport house
holds. Dr. Laurence E. Poole, health
department bacteriologist, : declared
today that Bridgeport milk is "rotten."
Nearly two-thirds of about 25 sam
ples of milk examined today by Dr.
Poole were poor. Some of them had
a. bacterial count Jf more than one
million per cubic centimeter. The
significance , of this may be grapsed
when it is considered that milk with
60,009 to 60,000 bacterial count is coni
sidered wholesome. -
"Rotten!'.' was the effrphatic ex
pression of Dr. Poole when he finished
his work this morning at the new
laboratories in the - First-Bridgeport
National Bank building. 1
"I have examined some pasteurized
milk, .too," said the . bacteriologist,
"but I'm not publishing what I
found." It is understood that, much
of the amateur pasteurization that is
being done is not properly conducted.
It was brought to the attention of
Dr. Poole this morning that milk is
being sold in Bridgeport as "certified,"
which has a' bacterial count of moae
than 250,000 per c c Milk with more
th.an 10,000 per c. c is not considered
good enough by Dr. Abraham So
phian, to be certified.

the events of the trip. The train was
commanded by Captain John A. Pear

men were obliged to construct an ex

firewood from the "chuck" wagon.
Elsewhere' they encountered handi

tial rains, long stretches - of gumbo
mud, these in addition to the extreme
ly difficult travel through' the country
at Wts best, with Its trackless, heavy,
thinly crusted sand for a driving sur
face. Beardsley reported that theSjeast
mileage for one. day was three miles,
made when the men were kept busy
building a roadway. The longest run
was 126 miles. .
The custom is for the 'trains to run

down, buildings falling in and fun

sides. Amidst this wreck, visions of
change and a revival of its former
glory sprung to. life in- the minds of
the two builders.' 1
To think was to act and buildings
were movd and repaired, fences grew

ing Night. N
New Tork, Sept. 14 Despite main
tenance of regular schedules on the
subway and elevated lines of the In
terborough Rapid Tranllt, Co. and the
gradual restoration, of service on the
surface lines, leaders of the striking
street railway employes declared to
day that they were far from being
defeated. . They hinted that the
danger of "a sympathetfc" strike Is
not yet over.
Following a parade and demonstra
tion by the strikers the question of a
sympathetic strike will be discussed
at meetings of the Central Federated
Unions of Brooklyn' and Manhattan.
Strike leaders predict that resolu
tions favoring a strike among trades
allied with the . street railway em
ployes will be adopted. Whether a
strike will actually take place, how
ever, will depend on the individual
votes of the unions. It Is asserted. .
Traction officials announced today
that service In the subway and on the
elevated roads was (better than nor
mal while service pn most of the
street car lines was from 25 to 40 per
cent, below normal. The , railway
companies assert that hundreds of
their former employes havereturned
to their work There was no disor
der during the night, due to the vig
ilance of the police and the order of
strike leaders to the men not to con
gregate on street corners and at car
barns. ( Frequent delays were caused
on the elevated lines, strikers becom
ing involved . in ' altercations with
Strikebreaking guards.1 In order to
stop the practice ' an order was en
forced today prohibiting . passengers
from riding om platfjrms.
Five, trolley cars came together in a
series of rear-end. collisions on the
Westchester Avenue line in the Bronx
today and 10 passengers were Injured,
of whom one was seriously hurt. The
accidents occurred at ' the foot of a

it is said, were strikebreakers, claimed

Engineers Say Possibility of
Beginning Grand Street
and East Washington Ave
nue Jobs is Remote and
Other May Be Delayed
, Needed Material Can't Be
Supplied. v !
vBridge construction in this city is
being A materially hampered by the
shortage of the steel supply throughK
out the, United States. Delays are not
only likely in the completion of the
Stratford avenue bridge but the possi
bility of the Grand street and Wash
ington avenue bridge. Contractors be
ginning even foundation work soon is
questioned in engineering circles to
day. ' ,
It became known today that the
west pier for the support of the bas-
ule span of the Stratford avenue
bridge has been temporarily aban
doned by the contracting firm under
their engineer's order, while the east
(cofferdam has been sunk to Its depth
and has progressed more rapidly. How
long the work will be delayed on the
west pier, is not definitely known
though William Russell, in charge of
the Holbrook, Cabot & Rollins con
tract here, asserted that he hoped to
continue next week.
It appears that in building the huge
wooden cofferdam that was sunk in
the form of a caisson, discrepancies
in the figures of engineers caused too
light a material to be used on the su
perstructure which is to support the
comfort stations. While the lower
and deeply submerged portion was
sufficiently strong to withold the
weight of concrete needed, the upper
section, which must, afford absolute
waterproof protection to the masonry
and the' men employed In the work
was found to be too light for actual
safety. It was decided ti erect an Ad
ditional steel cofferdam' about the
whole. This can be done only with
sheet-steel interlocking piling.
Hurry orders for the needed supply
met with- ill success in the contrac
tors' supply houses of New Tork and
other cities. The steel mills refused to
take orders for delivery within two
years.
The i Holbrook. Cabot & Rollins offi
cials here assert ' that they are now
pulling up a sufficient quantity in New
Tork harbor to complete the work
here. Until this arrives thene will be
no 'attempt to pump out the present
west eofrrdam on the Stratford ave
nue bridge.
With promises to the administration
that work on the Grand street -briige
would begin within two weeks after
the contracts were let, several months
have ela.psed during which no great
activity has been seen.

the new treaty is commented upon by
the state department as follows:
"The minister for foreign affairs ot
the imperial Russian ' government in
like manner assured , the American
ambassador in response to his inquiry,
that his government .had not with-,
drawn from the conventions of 1907
and 1910, but will maintain unim
paired the provisions ot those agree
ments notwithstanding the fact that
no mention of them was made in the
convention of 1918."
The treaties of 1907 and ,1910 be
tween Japan and Russia affirmed '
China's territorial integrity and the
open-door policy. Article 20 of' the
1907; treaty 'was reaffirmed with
slightly different wording m the 1910
convention, reads: ;
"The two contracting pnrtles recog- ;
nlze the Independence and territorial;
Integrity of the empire of China and
the principle -of equal opportunity in
whatever conceens commerce and in
dustry of all nations in that emplro
and engage to sustain and defend the
maintenance of the status quo and
respect for this principle by all the
specific means within their reach." '
State department officials today ex
pressed complete satisfaction with the .
unequivocal reply made by Japan and
the statement from the Russian for
eiffn office.. They feel these assur-1
ances with no doubt as to the main-
tenance of the open door policy and J
regard for American interests in
China.
