CHAPTER XIII.
A Sharpster's Trick.
EAVY hearted, all his enthusi
asm gone, Abner climbed the
stairs to the office. He found
Howard and Miss Lizzie both
reading two of the Atlanta morning pa
pers. They looked up as he entered.
"Disappointment for you. Uncle Ab,"
Howard said. "In some way Frank
Reymond got on to our big item and
has telegraphed it at some length. It
is a pity that we couldn't be the only
ones to handle it"
"I think I see where we made a mis
take," Miss Swayne spoke up. "W T e
ought not to have let Frank know we
had a piece of news. Of course he
went right out to see if anything was
floating about"
"It don't matter—it don't matter a
dang bit!" Abner growled. He picked
up the New Clarion and with a look of
high disgust began to scan the Elk
town article.
"Jackass, jackass!" he said to him
self and of himself. "Of course thar
ain't no sech a man as Thomas L.
Keith over thar; that's made up out o'
whole cloth like the balance. Le'rne
see; whar is them dang letters so much
is made of? Here they are:
"T. D. G. A. O. M. E. 85. M. S. D.'
Abner went over them slowly, one by
one. Suddenly he looked up from the
paper, stared steadily at Howard and
asked:
"Do you happen to remember what
number on Main street Tarp's store is
at?"
"Eighty-five." Howard answered
"It's Leen printed often enough."
With a grim face and steady stride
Abner went to a window and looked
down on the street below.
"Tarp's Dry Goods and General Mer
chandi.se Emporium, 85 Main Street.
Darley!" he îquttered. "That's the ar
tide he wanted to run in at 3 cents a
line, an' I held out fer 10. Tarpy. oi l
boy, I hain't got on my hat just now,
but ef I had it on an' you appeared
before me I'd take it off an' sweep the
ground with it. You don't look so aw
fully bright, but appearances are de
ceitful. Thank God we ain't alone in
the mess. Them big dailies tilt
quick ns we did cf they didn't spread
it on as thick over the'r whole front
page."
"May Ï edme in, gentlemen?" A
flushed face appeared at the door, and,
smiling apologetically, Frank Ileymond
walked in. "I hated to do it." he
laughed, "but 'all's fair in love and
war,' and I have to hold up my end
or lose my job. My papers want all
the news, and if 1 hadn't landed that
shark they would have thought I was
sound alseep. As you see, I exagger
ated some. You know I stated that all
the places of business here in town
were shut up."
"And that the mob broke into the
hardware store to get picks and sliov
els to take to the scene of action,"
Howard added. "You covered less
space than we did. Frank, but you lied
more."
"Next time you'll divide with a fel
low, I reckon?" Reymond said teas
ing! y.
"Ef we ever git hold of a thing like
this we'll donate it to you free of
charge, Frank." Abner put in sarcas
tically. "News like that ain't fit for
a rural paper."
Miss Swayne was at a window now
looking down below. "I see Tarp's

ers in the street. There are two boys
doing the same thing farther down.
They are running fast and yelling out

Nobody replied, and Abner leaned
ont of the window and shouted. "Hey.

lie met the panting youth at the head
of the stairs, as also did Miss Lizzie, who
took a circular and brought it back to
her table.
"Yes. Jim Hill printed it," she said
"Bad, bad work. Good gracious, folks!
Talk about quick action! Tarp Is al

Listen:
rent excitement over at Elktotvn
Since the first settlement of Georgia no
greater sensation has been sprung on the
state than the vast interest over the report
of a certain buried treasure of gold. Our
enterprising paper, the New Clarion (new
in mere ways than one in this ripe age of
gullibility), gave the main part of Its pres
ent issue to the tale, and the big dailic3 all
over the United States took It up with a
whoop and a yell. And what was It all
about ? Why, a boy over near Elktown
discovered on a rock some mysterious let
ters. Thev were:
T. D. G. A. G. M. E. 85 M. S. D. And
when he reported it at home the entire
community went wild. They at once
dreamed out a cock and bull yarn about
an Indian finding a treasure of gold and
leaving some letters on a rock as a guide
to the spot. The Indian princess who was
to inherit all the loot wasn't mentioned
Neither was the young chief who was a
suitor for her hand and threw himself over
a cliff when the clew was lost. But lo and
behold! It now transpires that the let
ters were painted by a sign writer the en
terprising J. L. Tarp employed to go
about decorating barns, fences and even
the face of nature Itself with the rare op
portunities this great merchant Is holding
out to the populace at large. The letters
T. D. G. A. G. M. E. 85 M. S. D.' simply
stand for 'Tarp's Dry Goods and General
Merchandise Emporium, 85 Main Street,
Darley.' It looks as if any sensible per
son aware of Tarp's enterprise would have
recognized the true meaning of the let
ters. but it seems as if our wisest and
most conservative citizens made the lam
entable error herewith recorded. How
ever, while there Is some little disappoint
ment over the outcome, the majority are
realizing that while a buried treasure Is
out of the question, yet a mine of pure
gold is found in the rare bargains Tarp Is
offering to one and all. lie begs respect
ful leave to mention In this connection
that he has Just got in a full line of boys'
nd men's suits which are being fairly
beaten to powder under the sledge ham
mer of cash reduction and"—
'Funk!" Miss Lizzie broke off in dis
gust. "The idea of Tarp trying to tie
his little old business on to a piece of
news like— But, say!" she frowned in
perplexity, "isn't it funny that he has
managed to make those letters exactly
lit his"—
" 'Taiu't overly funny to me," Abner
grunted as he crushed the circular in
his hand and dropped it on the floor.
'Has either of you boys got hobnails
your shoes? Ef you have I want
to squat on my all fours at the head
o' the stairs and have you kick me into
the street. An' I'd like fer the whole
dang town to see me when I hit the
round,"
Blank faces mot the remark. There
was dead sfilence for a u'jnute. Then
Reymond groaned:
"I see it! Lord, Lord, I see It! Bun
ko Is no name for the trick played
on us."
At this moment one of Tarp's clerks
came and handed Daniel one of the
circulars and left. Written on the top
wore the words:
Editors of the New Clarion:
Dear Sirs—Kindly insert the Inclosed clr
■ular among the locals in your next Issue.
Vi they will make only a few lines I will
live to pay your price per line: but, as 1
eld you. I think that rate is too steep for
nr-ything as long, for instance, as the ad
ihable letter from your Elktown corre
,'Ondenl, to which my circular calls mod
est att«ntion. Respectfully yours and
with kindest regards. J. L. TARP.
"Does he think we'll l>e fool enough
to print it?" Howard asked angrily.
"He'll have to pay us for all that
space."
"He's already paid me," Abner re
"He's already paid me," Abner re
torted. "He's give me a million dol
lars' worth of experience. Yes, boys,
we've got to grin. A good, healthy, for
givin' grin is the only cure fer a dis
ease like our'n. He's got us whar the
hair is short. We've got a chance to
make folks think we took the stuff as
an ad. au' got paid for it. But, la! ef
we kick one single bit we'll never hear
the end of it."
"I don't know what my papers will
say to me," Frank Reymond groaned.
"I'm expected to send in facts and noth
ing hut facts. Now i'll have to wire
'em that it was all a fake."
"Ef you don't the railroad? may run
some excursions up that way," Abner
said. "I'd sorter bate to have the may
or and city council of Atlanta startin'
fer Elktown with campin' outfit aud
minin' tools."
Howard's place at the table In the
hotel was next to Mrs. Langham aud
her daughter. He found Cora alone at
dinner one day.
"1 have a surprise for you." she smil
ed, "and It may not he a pleasant one
either. Do you still intend to go to At
lanta tomorrow?"
"Yes, I have some business Mr. Dan
lei wants me to attend to, and 1 hav
postponed it as long as I can. What
Is your surprise?"
"Why, I was telling mother about
your going, and it really put her in the
notion of running down on the same
day. We have some shopping to do,
and she wants to have a look at her
flowers, which she is afraid our house
keeper may be neglecting. We would
be there only a day and night and then
come back here."
"I am glad you are going," Howard
said. "It will make the trip much more
pleasant, for I don't care much for At
lanta in the warm weather."
"You must take luncheon with us
when we arrive tomorrow," Cora said.
"Mother has set her heart on it. She
has already written to our housekeeper
to have everything ready. You've
never been to our home, and it is really
rather nice, even in the summer time,
for it Is cool and weil shaded."
With some vague misgivings, the
nature of which Howard hardly uu
derstood, he accepted the invitation.
"You will meet my father, too, 1
ho|)e," Cora continued. "He is taking
his meals at the club; but if lie is not
overwhelmed with business he will
join us at lunch. He is a very nice
a
man, if I do say it," she added, with
smile; "he is rather stem In his man
ner even with mother and me. but he Is
dear, dear man."
Howard had to do some early morn
ing work at the office the next day, and
so did not meet the Langhnms till just
before their departure at 8 o'clock
ne joined them in the observation
ar at the end of the train, where they
had secured comfortable seats.
The Journey was pleasant enough to
the young couple. Howard was dis
covering a side to Cora's nature that
was new to him, and he was not re
belling so strongly against her attrac
tions. He was half convinced that he
had misjudged her in regard to her
hunger for the admir :tion of men, and.
after all, he began to ask himself, who
could know positively that a confirm
ed flirt might not love some particular
man as strongly and as unselfishly as
any other woman? At any rate, the
bare thought that she might actually
care for him was an attractive one.
'The carriage will meet us." Cora
informed Howard, as he got her things
together. "James is always prompt
and will be anxious to see us. \V<*
have luncheon at 2 o'clock. It is now
11. and you may go directly home with
us if you wish," Cora added, as they
came out of the car and Joined the
throng of passengers going toward the
door leading to the street. "There will
be plenty of Sa the carriage."
"There is something I must attend
to at once." Howard answered. "1
think I had better come out later. 1
might miss the man I expect to see if
wait till the afternoon."
"You would if we had our way about
it," Cora answered sweetly. "Once we
get you out home we will keep you ns
long as possible."
The driver, a middle aged colored
man, wore a silk hat and a long, dark
blue coat with brass buttons, and ns
he reached for the satchels Howard
carried he doffed his hat and bowed
servilely to the ladles.
Why didn't Mr. Langham come?"
Mrs. Langham asked, as they all fol
lowed the driver to the resplendent ve
hicle and well groomed bays at the
edge of the sidewalk.
"Said he was too busy, miss," James
answered, as he opened the carriage
door and stood, still hatless, to one
side. "Said fer me ter drive down fer
'im at dinner time an' fetch 'im out."
As the prancing horses bore them
away and Howard turned to cross the
street to go to the business part of the
city he glanced back. Cora was look
ing from a window. She waved a del
Icate handkerchief at him and smiled.
All the time that he was engaged in
transacting the business he had come
to attend to Cora remained In his
thoughts.
Two o'clock found him alighting
from an electric car in front of the
Langham residence.
A young colored maid in white cap
and apron and careful step answered
Howard's ring and showed him Into
the great double drawing room on the
right of an equally roomy hall, from
which a polished walnut stairway
curved upward. Seating himself, he
looked about him. Beyond the farthest
parlor was a library, and adjoining this
was a smoking room, or den. Massive
plate glass mirrors in gilt frames rose
from the floor to the ceiling at oppo
site ends of the drawing rooms, giving
rooms, giving
the effect of more space than could
otherwise have been obtained.
He thought of Mary Trumbley with
a certain touch of homesickness. He
smiled as he fancied seeing her seated
in one of the wing chairs opposite him.
8he would be too well bred to smile,
but she would be honest enough to
think, and she would condemn his
presence there. And, after all, why
iiad he come? Why was he paying
such attention to Cora Langham?
Why unless attracted either by her
personality or social position?
CHAPTER XIV.
The Murder of Craig.
AMES L. TARP one Sunday
morning drove out to Trum

in the store the day before, and
r.s he with his own hands cut off ami
wrapped up the few yards of calico she
had bought she had chided him for not

had been his habit. He had pleaded
overwork as the reason be had not

that Sunday was a good day for town

displeasure.
Mary was not Informed of the no.
ticipated visit till the next morning ai
breakfast She was an obedient girl
and said nothing, though her lips were
drawn firmly and there was a cold
gleam in her eyes. When the merchant
arrived he and she attended service at
the little meeting bouse iiaif a mile
dowu the main road, aud when the
returned they found that dinner was
ready. Abner Daniel was seated with
her father on the porch, and Abner
rose to shake hands with Tarp as the
couple came up the steps.
After dinner Tarp asked Mary to
take a ri je with him in his buggy, and
fearing her mother's displeasure, she
accepted. They drove along a delight
fully shaded mountain road. Mary
had noted her companion's peculiar
manner.
"There is no use beating the devil
about the bush. Miss Mary." he began
when he had reseated himself by her
side and taken up the reins. "I've got
to get a wife, and you are the sort of
a girl 1 like."
Mary was fairly pale. She was si
lent for a moment, then faltered:
"Tiie trouble is that 1 really do not
feel as you do. 1 look at marriage dif
feront ly. I must love the—the man
marry, if I should marry
,V- >*•■**« ■
1 admire i
you, but you must never mention this
subject to me again."
"Well, you know best," the merchant
slowly answered. "I must now give
my attention to Miss Bessie Williams,
my new milliner, whom you have met
I should rather have you, but your at
titude congiels me to leave the matter
slide."
• •*••••
Despite the strong efforts made by
Abuer Daniel and Pole Baker to pre
vent a meeting between Howard Tins
ley and Fred Craig, the thing came
about sooner than expected. One
morning as Howard was entering the
postoffice he encountered Craig coming
out. As usual, the farmer was flushed
with drink. HLs eyes flashed with
fury ns they met those of the younger
man. and he grunted in contempt
Stepping up to him. Howard demanded

twisted it sharply downward aud hit
him ou the cheek. For an instant they
stood apart, then rushed together, and
several powerful blows were given and
ta
alien before the town marshal and
deputy reached the scene and. aided by
the bystanders, separated the two by
sheer force. Craig was struggling wild
and was wiping the blood from a
gashed lip, trying to draw his revolver
from his hip pocket and growling like
an infuriated brute. Frank Reymond
was among Howard's friends who
seized him and led him toward his
oom in the hotel that he might wash
ills bruised face and arrange his dress,
his shirt and necktie being torn.
"You must have common sense and
not fight a drunken fool like that,"
Frank said soothingly.
Howard drew back on the edge of
the pavement. "Common sense!" he
panted, beside himself witli rage as
the curious crowd gathered and press
ed close about them. "There is only
one sort of common sense I'll have, and
that is this, Risten, all of you. I'll
kill that puppy as sure as God let's
me get at him. Wait and see if I
don't. Yon may pull us apart now,
hut I am uot through with him."
"Don't listen to him," Frank said to
the crowd. "He's mad and excited,
the crowd. "He's mad and excited,
lie doesn't mean that"
"Mean it? You don't know me,"
Howard cried. "The world is not big
enough for us both. I'll settle him. I
swear I will. I'll kill him like a dog.
Some of you heard what he called me.
If you think I'll take it you are no
friends of mine."
At this moment Abner Daniel pushed
his way through the throng to How
ard's side. "Come up to your room
and get your clothes straight" he said,
his face pale with excitement and sym
pathy. "We've got some important
work to do at the office."
"I've got important work to do out
tide of the office," Howard fumed, but
he allowed his old friend to lend him
by the arm up to his room, where he
left him.
At the door of the office Abner found
Pole Baker waiting for him. Pole had
heard the news, and Abner had never
seen him look so grave.
"Meddling folks have been totin' tales
betwixt the two," he remarked. "1 got
onto several nasty squibs floating
about. Thar are men who had rather
keep bad blood stirred up than make a
fortune In money, and a good many are
jealous of Howard's rise. Tills bas
just begun. Uncle Ab; nothin' but gun
shots will satisfy them two. I can't
blame Howard, 1er the boy simply was
born with a pride and a temper that
nothin' kin check in a mess like this."
"Howard said too much before that
crowd Just now," Abuer answered. "If
—if he did happen to harm that skunk
he'd have a harcF case iu court to light,
after the positive way he spoke before
so many witnesses. \\ hut's to be done?
I don't know, I'm sure. We eau't put
the boy under restraint, fer lie is his
own boss—free, white, an' twenty-one.
They say Craig used an awful word
to 'im; but the courts won't be influ- I
enced by that if anything deliberate
is done, an' ef they meet again it would
be after deliberation."
Half an hour after the fight Howard
visited Higgins, the gunsmith, and ask
ed if his revolver were fixed.
"Yes. it is ready, Howard, but"—
Tiie old man hesitated. "The truth Ls,
Howard, that I don't want to return
it to you just now."
"Give it to me!" Howard demanded
sharply. "It's my property, and I will
have it
"Pardon me for being rough, Mr,
Higgius." lie said sharply, "but Craig
is armed, and I've got to be also."

office. Abner, unable to work through
sheer worry, was waiting for him.
"There is a thing you mustn't for
get." Aimer remarked, with the inten
tion of taking his young friend's mind
from the dangerous theme, "and that
is you have an engagement to call on
Mary this evening. I heard you mak»
it, you know, and I told her I would
fetch you back with me in my buggy
and make you take supper there. You
could spend tiie night at her house or
walk hack to town afterward, just as
you see fit.''
"I will walk back," Howard answer
ed. "I like to get to werk early. I
hadn't forgotten my engagement."
From a (Kissing farmer Tobias Trum
bley had heard of the encounter. He
had brought the news home before
sundown, and Mary was quite upset,
though she endeavored to conceal her
emotions from the family.
After supper Abner and the others
left the young couple under I he tree
In the mooulight. Nothing had been
said at the table on the all inqiortnut
subject, and It looked as If Mary scarce
I
ly dared to touch on it. However, as
he was rising to leave she venture«! to
sjienk of it
"I'm awfully sorry and worried," she
faltered, "and not alone for myself, as
your best friend, Howard, but for your
mother. When she hears of this, as
she is sure to do, it will almost break
her heart She heard about the dispute
you had with Craig not long ago, and
she, along with many of us, has been
dreading the outcome."
Howard smiled in a forced sort of a
way. He had taken Mary's hand and
he now stroked it soothingly, "i can't
talk to a girl about a thing of this na
ture. Mary." he said gently. "You
women do not understand."
"We understand n great deal more
than you give us credit for." Mary
gave him her eyes steadily. "We un
