A Bank Account is proof of earnest
eTfort and
accomplish
ment
A bank account shows that you are seeking to make the
most of your efforts and your time.
It is, besides, a mark of solidity. It gives a man standing
in the eyes of others as a .solid citizen.
The world confers its favors on those who prove capable of
doing justice to themselves as well us to others. In justice to
yourself you should start a'bank account.

GOLDEN WEDDING.
The Herald received the following
short letter Wednesday afternoon:
Ewtok Herald: Ai Golden Wed
dings aro not very common, thought
we would let you know that we cele
brated ours without much gold on
Tuesday, September 12, 1010, at high
noon.
Mr. axd Mrs. FkaKe M. Enomsh.
If the old settlers of this town and
county had known that Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Knglish wore entitled to cele
brate their Golden Wedding last Tues
day, that estimable couple would have
"heard something to their advantage."
These old settlers might not have
given them much gold, but they most
certainly would have "rounded them
up" nnd given them hearty congratu
lations and hearty hand-shakes, and
some little noise.
Frank Knglish and his wife are num
bered among the oldest settlers In this
county, nnd lime been successful in
llimncial nirairs lint above all money
values they regard the lovoand respect
of their old friends na their most pro
clous )0esslon on thU earth They
are the kind of people that one. wishes
could lite long enough to celebrate
two or three golden weddings, if that
would make them any happier. The
Herald wishes them the best of every
thing In the world, while, they remain
in the world, and may the time be long
before they are called away from those
who so highly regard them.
BOYS' AND GIRLS' CLUB WORK.
Do you know all about tia "Boys'
and Girls Club Work? " Maybe you
do, but we haven't heard you mention
the matter. Thn writer Is just begin
ning to comprehend what the "Club
Work" means.
It Ib h highly important work. In
this State it Is carried on under the
supervision of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, the Oklahoma Agricultu
ral College co-operating, and the
"Work" Is under tho immediate super
vision of the County Farm Demon
strator, and the Lady Agent, where
one is employed. The Uluus now at
work in this County are as follows
The Boys Ooru Club; Boys' l'eanut
Club; Boys' and Girls' 1'igClubj Boys'
and Girls Poultry Olub; Boys' Groin
Sorghum Olub; , Girls Better Bread
Club; Girls' Canning Olub; Boys'
Crop notation Olub.
Now theso clubs are expected to give
an exhlbitlgn of the, fruits of their in
dustries each year, and there are vari
ous premiums given by the U. S.and
the State. The exhibit this fall will
be held at the High School buldlng in
Beaver, on Friday, September 2nd,
where all such exhibits will be judged
by capable judges, and the winners of
first prize in each club will be awarded
a Scholarship at the State Fair School
at Oklahoma City, held during the
State Fair. Club boya and eirls attend
ing the State Fair will bo the guests of
the city during tho Fair, but are re
quired to furnish their own transport
ation to and from that city
Now the winners of first prizes in
these clubs will have a snap this time.
The Commercial Olub of Beaver City,
at their meeting last week, volunta
rily and on their own motion voted
unanimously to furnish the money to
pay the railroad faro of theso children
who win the right to attend the State
Fair at Oklahoma City.
It strikes us that the Beaver Com
mercial Club did a very nice, act in do
ing this. It will give the winners of
theso club prizes a line chance to at
tend tho State Fair and school without
a cent of expense to themselves. It
also shows that the people of Beaver
City appreciate what the farmer boys
and girls are doing to make thirCuun
ty a better place in which to live.
Owing to the weather conditions this
summer there will probably be no ex
hibit by the Corn Club Peanut, Can
ning, or Crop Rotation Clubs, but all
the other clubs will exhibit their pro
ducts as announced. Don't forget the j
time, Friday, September 22.
