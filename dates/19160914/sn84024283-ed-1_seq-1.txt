two thousand and twenty -two
miles without stopping the
motor is held by a Maxwell
stock touring car.

O other car at any price has ever approached .
this wonderful record of endurance.
In addition to this proven sturdiness, remember that the
Maxwell averages between 25 and 30 miles per gallon
of gasoline.
Moreover, the Maxwell is complete. It has elec
tric starter and , lights; demountable ' rims; one-man
mohair top; speedometer, roomy, comfortable seats and
an attractive appearance.
Are you particular about details? Do you demand
evidence of value? If so, you will investigate the
Maxwell, the features, record and reputation of which
proclaim it the world's greatest motor car value. '

Some Political Pointers.
: Regarding the Democratic nominee
for Secretary of State, the Carnthers
ville Democrat says: """John L. Sulli
van is some campaigner. He went
and saw the voters personally and
won them over by his engaging per
sonality and evident sincerity. Sulli
van will win in a walk this fall and
will make an efficient Secretary."
Let Well Enough Alone.
Wallace Crossley, Democratic nomi
nee for Lieutenant-Governor, has im
pressed the people of the state by his
clean-cut ability and force. Then, too,
he is a fine campaigner.
John Gordon, who received more
votes in the primary than his two
competitors combined, will turn
around and walk right back into the
State Auditor's office in November.
Now ii Time to Fight Heuian Fly.
On account of the dry weather but
few adult Hessian flies have emerged
from Infested wheat stubble, 'says T.
J. Talpert of the College of Agricul
ture of the University of Missouri.
The pest may still be found In the old
wheat stubble In the flaxseed 'stage,
when it can be destroyed by plowing
and harrowing.
If the plowing Is done in September,
special pains should be taken to work
the ground into a compact and Arm
seed bed. This will prevent the fly
from espaping and the wheat Will
make a much better growth during
the fall and early winter.
"Don't fail to keep down the volun
teer wheat which will soon start on
the plowed ground," advises Mr. Tal
bert. ','Tne destruction of volunteer
wheat starves the fly. llemember
that the food plants of the Hessian fly
are wheat, rye and barloy and that
none of these crops should be sown
until onor after the fly-free date,
which is for the northern third of
Missouri, October 1; for the central
third, October 8; and for the southern
third, October 1(1. These are the safe
sowing dates and they should be ob
served in order to escape Injury from
the Hessian fly."
A united fight should be made
against the fly, acoordlng to Mr. Tal
bert, because If one farmer sows his
wheat early or fails to keep down
volunteer wheat, he may let enough
flies live over winter In his early wheat
to come out In the spring and destroy
his own crop and the wheat crops of
his .neighbors who may have sown
their wheat on or after the fly-free
date. In the spring the fly comes
from early sown wheat and volunteer
wheat. -.

Shoot the Buzzards.
"Shoot The Buzzards" they are
liable to spread many contagious
diseases among animals. The hog
cholera season is here, and the buz
zards help to spread this disease, so
says State Veterinarian Dr. D. F.
Lucky.
A few outbreaks of anthrax have
occurred In northern Arkansas. This
disease is usually prevalent further
south and seldom becomes widespread
as far north as It has this year. An
thrax Is equally as bad as hog cholera.
Buzzards are likely to carry anthrax
from nothern Arkansas into Missouri.
Shoot the buzzards and burn them!
Mob( people think there is a law In
Missouri against killing buzzards.
There Is no law to this effect, and
has not been for at least many years,
buzzards are a menace to live stock
production, and therefore should be
killed and burued. "Shoot The Buz
George Middlecamp, nominee for
State Treasurer, hasn'nt 'much more
opposition than he had in the primary.
And that was nothing. He is a wheel-
horse for work, a democrat of the
highest character, and he will breeze
in.
Frank McAllister, roly-poly nomi
nee for Attorney General, in whom
popularity and efficiency meet, can
be most serious when occasion re
quires,. Just now It is the serious
business of showing how far he can
distance his opponent in the race.
That the Federal Rural Credits law
will be fairly administered is assured
by President Wilson who has ap
pointed two Democrats and two Re
publicans to the new Federal Farm
Loan Board.
The ex-justice needs some profes
sional cheerers on his campaign tour,
His speeches arouse about as much
enthusiasm as the Iceman with the
last summer's bill.
Missouri state banks and trust com
panies alone, leaving out national in
stitutions, show an increase of $41,
600,000 In deposits this year over last
year. This is the answer to republi
can calamity howlers.
"Deeds, not words," Is what Mr.
Hughes says he wants, But he is
spouting words while President Wil
son is grinding through a hot summer
in Washington attending to the na
tion's business.
That the state of the country under
the Wilson administration is such as
to make the ancient adage "Let well
enough alone" eminently applicable
and timely is shown In the following
report of Williom Hosier, staff cor
respondent of the International News
Service, who is accompanying Hughes
the Fault-Finder in his campaign
over the western trail the pathfinders
traveled a century ago.'
From Denver, August 31st, he re
ports on the Hughes reception at a
Colorado county fair:
'Evidence of the prosperity which
practically the entire West is enjoy
ingone of the hardest nuts the can
didate has to crack in this campaign-
greeted him on every side at this
gathering of farmers. There were
not lees than 2,000 automobiles lined
up along the race track when the
Hughes party entered the fair
grounds. Thousands of well-fed,
well-clotbed women and children and
prosperous looking grangers were
present. . 4
"The sheds scattered 'about the en
closure were stocked with fat prize
hogs, sleek cattle and every variety
of farm products. Overhead a
monoplane evoluted. It was a fair
sample of the 'let well enough alone'
audiences which have greeted Mr.
Hughes throughout the tour."
Out For Wilson and Democratic Ticket.
Colonel Frederick- D. Gardner,
Democratio nominee for Governor, is
a "go-getter," the Bates County
Democrat remarks. Correot. He
will "getter" all right.
The Hughes Idea Is that republicans
must hold office forever.
Now Is the time for democratio
"slackers" to get in the, party
trenches.
"I'm agin what Wilson's fur, and
fur what Wilson's agin," is the
Hughes policy In homely phrase. .
"Would you have urged upon con
gress an embargo upon the shipment
of munitions to the allies?" This
question, addressed to Mr. Hughes by
a group of noted writers, including
George Creel, remains unanswered.
(Jackaon Cash-Book.)
Charles B. Nolaad, of near Fruit
City, brought fifteen head of hogs to
this city yesterday morning and sold
them to J. W. Daugherty for SJ262.26.
The fifteen head were a few days over
five months old. When Charles
figured it up and found that he could
get 817.48 apiece for five-months-old
hogs under a Demfocratio admlnis
tration, he decided that times were
good enough for the farmer and an
nounced that he was going to vote for
Woodrow Wilson and the rest of the
Democratic ticket in November. Mr,
Noland has voted the Republican
ticket for twenty years, but like
many other Republicans he thinks for
himself and has been convinced that
the Republican claim that a high pro
tective tariff is necessary for good pri
ces is getting too worn and threadbare,
ne recalled how in 1907 depositors
couldn't eet their own money from
some of the banks throughout the
country, and said that condition had
never existed under a Democratio
administration.
Another example of good times for
the farmer is reported by Tim Brod
erlck, farmer and stock-trader, who
on Monday of this week sold five
sucking'cal ves for 830 apiece. If any
one has any doubts about Tim know
ing good times when they come, just
ask him now ne expects to vote.
Typhoid Fever Season is Here.
The. season for tyhoid fever Is Bp
proachlng. With the multiplication
of flies this danger increases, and the
beginning of autumn the typhoid fev
er is upon us.
According to Drr M. P. Ravenel
of the department of preventive
medicine at the University of Mis
souri, care should be taken in select
ing a place for a vacation. Due pre
cautions ia looking Into the sanitary
surroundings, especially the purity of
the water supply; and the proper
disposal of sewage, should be exercis
ed.
Tyhoid fever can be practically
elimated by the use of anti-typhoid
vaccine. This is given in three in
jections at intervals of ten days so
that the process is completed ou the
twentieth, da;'. The injections arc not
painful, and seldom give rise to any
marked reaction. The protection is
almost absolute. It lasts for two and
one-half to three years.
In the United Sates Army, includ
ing the Philipine Scouts, the troops
in Porto Rico, China, Alaska and other
parts of the world, a total of, 90,750
men, there were only four cases of
typhoid fever and no deaths during
an entire year. Such a thing as 90,-
000 men exposed in all sorts of ways
and places of the world, passing an
entire year without a single death
from typhoid fever and only four
cases, has never been heard of in the
world before. Even this does not tell
the entire story. Of these four cases,
three were in recruits who had not
been vaccinated. Only on6 vaccinal
ed man out of the 90,000 contracted
typhoid fever, and his vaccination had
been done two years previously.
Anti-typhoid vaccination is there
fore advised as a preparation for the
summer vacation. People over 45
years old do not require it, but per
sons under this age should take it
The laboratory of the department of
preventive medicine or the University
of Missouri furnishes the vaccine free
of charge to all practicing physicians
