PRIZE AND $10.t0 AS FIFTH PRIZE. MANY SPECIAL
PRIZES OFFERED DURING THE CONTEST.
The World inaugurated last week the biggest subscription cam
paign ever put on by a newspaper in this section of North Dakota
Smd the people of Devils Lake and Ramsey county have taken an
interest in' the elegant prizes which we are offering at this time.
The list of names of those who have been nominated at this time
goes to dhow that interest is being taken. We do not expect all
whose names appear on the list will be active contestants in fact
we only expect about ten per cent of those who are nominated to
take an active part.
This campaign will run approximately seven weeks closing Oct.
28th, 8 3P. M. The competition is open to ladies, single or married
of this and adjucent counties. The special services of M. G. Rob
inson has been secured during this campaign and he will conduct
this campaign under the direction of this paper.
The editor takes a great deal of pride in making this exceptional
departure from the time-worn channels of the common endeavor.
Elsewhere in the columns of this issue a page ad will tell you what
we propose to dt in behalf of our business and for the pleasure and
profit of the many friends of this paper.
It is a contest «r circulation campaign, of a magnitude anc
splendor never before equaled by a paper in Ramsey county. It
means that The Worid is going to swing hundreds of new readers
tc its circulation department. This is to be done within approxi
mately seven short1weeks from date. Measured by our past suc
cess we feel that the correct plan has been adopted this time to ac
complish the most for the expansion and extension of The World.
The plan is to let Ramsey county people do the work, giving those
who try, the benefit of the prizes rather than import a number of
professional solicitors and paying them a percentage.
To stimulate if not electrify this community,VEfte World will give
to the energetic winners, those who receive the highest number of
votes on subscription taken for The World tne above list of
prizes: The Ovferland is a five-passenger touring car, 1917 model

Chicag.o Sept. 13.—Former Con
gressman Frank O. Lowden, of Ore
gon, 111., and Governor F. Dunne were
nominated by large pluralities for
governor by the republicans and dem
ocratis respectively in the Illinois
primaries today, according to esti
mates based on incomplete returns to
night.
Lowden carried Chicago by a plur
ality of 40,000 over Morton D. Hull
of Chicago, second man, returns from
one-third of the city indicated. Frank
L. Smith of Dwight, 111., ran a poor
third in Chicago. Down state returns
indicated a heavy plurality for Low
den, with Smith running close to Hull.
Estimates based on incomplete re
turns from the entire state put Lov
den's plurality at more than 150,000.
Dunne Is Victorious.
Dunne apparently carried Chicago
over Wm. B. Brinton of Dixon, 111., by
more than 70,000, and running on
the basis of about 2 to 1 over Brin
ton down state. Early returns indi
cated Dunne's plurality for the entire
state would equal or exceed Lowden's
in the entire state., Brinton was en
dorsed by Roger C. Sullivan.
Congressional Vote.

LOCAL YOUNG
PEOPLE WED
MISS ALICE CADDIGAN BECOMES
BRIDE OF MR. WM. JACOBSEN.
Tuesday morning of this week at
the Catholic parsonage in this city
occurred the amrriage of Mr. Wm.
Jacobsen to Miss Alice Caddigan, both
prominent young people of this city.
The ceremony was performed bv
Rev. Father Edward, and soon there
after the young couple left in their
car for Grand Forks, where they will
spend their honeymoon, and later will
be at home to their friends in the
Glerum block.
The groom is one of our leading
young business men, being the pro
prietro of the Royal Blue shoe store,
which has formerly been conducted by
himself and brother, but recently he
purchased the interest of his brother
and he is now sole proprietor.
The bride is a splendid young lady,
who has been reared from childhood
in this city. She is a sister of Mrs.
Wm. Redmond, and the daughter of
John Caddigan, a former well known
railroad man of this city. The happy
young couple have a host of friends
who will join in extending congratu
lations and wishing them a long and
happy wedded life.

HIGHLY ENCOURAGING IN RE­

CAMPAIGN.
Portland, Me., Sept. 11.—Maine re

the election today. They elected a
governor, an auditor, two Unitct
States senators and four representa
tives in congress, and wresting con
trol of the state house of representa
tives from the democrats, will be ailj
on a joint vote of the legislature, to
elect the other state officers not chos
en by popular vote.
Carl E. Milliken led his ticket, de
feating Oakley C. Curtis, who sought
re-election by a plurality of approxi
mately 13,000.
Effect Far Reaching.
The Republican drift extended to
county officers, the greater number
counties choosing republican county
attorneys and sheriffs. These offices
are important locally because th
with enforcing
holders are charged
the prohibitory law.
The vote was heavy, as had been
expected, for the campaign had been
waged with a determination not seen
in recent years. The country
searched out for speakers of national
prominence and a great number of
these battled on national issues. The
fight was particularly hot for th
two United States senatorships, and
the four places held by Maine in the
lower house at Washington. National
defense, the tariff, apd the eight-how
law for railway men loomed up large
ly in the speaking.
Presages Victory.
United States Senator-elect Fred
ick.Hale tonight sent the follo^ng to
Charles E. Hughes:

for the rest of the country. We have

with a number of prominent prohibi
tion people passed through the city,
remaining over for about 45 minutes,
while Mr. Hanley addressed a good
sized audience in the local opera
house. He is a polished orator and
gave a talk which was appreciated by
his listeners. His theory is that they
cannot hope to elect their ticket but
if they get a million votes for the
cause that will be the means of forc
ing national prohibition. From here
the train passed on west. He will
make short talks at various points
until they reach Minot, where he was
to remain over night and deliver an
address in the evening.
