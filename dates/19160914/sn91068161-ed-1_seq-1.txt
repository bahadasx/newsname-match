To say HendersonvHle miCk&fitS
fifA gofiig to offer bargains on "dollar
Tay- is very consvativ& for their
reliability is so well Known that when
they offer a dollar article for sale it
ic worth the fulj value of this medium,
of trade. So you, dear reader, are ad
vised not to let one advertisement in
this paper escape. .your careful read-in-
for thereby you may miss the
notice of the sale of the very article
you most desire and have been wait
ing to see offered at a bargain. To
rightly appreciate 'dollar day' you
4iust study the advertising columns of

pared to take advantage of the dollar
-ales.
One man has asked, what is dollar
day it seems to be a new celebration
I am not familiar with? Some of the
readers of the Hustler may not be
very familiar with this plan of mu
tual benefit, so a little story about a
nearby town might be interesing, and
give some idea of the plan of the sale.
In Greenville, S. C, in July the, mer
chants had a dollar day sale." It was
well advertised, the daily papers were
ful' of attractive advertisements and
in consequence when the day of the
sale came there were crowds of people
in town. As one countryman express
ed it. "it was like circus day so many
people." One merchant said he . was
offering a bargain in a ready-made
dresses and long before time to open
up his store, people were standing
around the door waiting to come In.
dress, another a dollar shirt 'walst.'l
These dresses went like hot cakes al
though their style was not so new as
it has been a few seasons, back; but
the material was good and they were
fully worth the dollar; :.' , v'v V
A drug store offered a . choice ' col
lection of toilet articles and his clerks
could ' ndf wait on ali the customers..
Each store had its special dollar ar
ticle displayed besides their regular
line of goods was put. attractively be
fore this crowd of customers. ' .
It was like an excursion to town or
a real holiday to people from the sur
rounding towns and country. Seeing
one's old friends and mingling togeth
er and looking over the bargains gave
a day of pleasure as well as of profit,
and the merchants decided thr,t the
day had been so successful that they
would offer equally as attractive in
ducements to their customers another
year and have another dollar day sale.
This paper will carry 'to its readers
tke account of the bargains offered on
dollar day, and those in the surround
ing towns and in 'the country and in
Hendersonville are a3ked to read care
fully these advertisements and be
in town and on the street that day for
there will be many doing their fall
shopping early before the bargains
have been all picked up and you would
be glad to be one among the fortunate
ones. -

age residing in Hendersonville has

year according to the census being
703 white and 373 colored. While
both races showed the same increase
in numbers, ,the colored increased in
greater proportion.
Superintendent Blackstock is now
preparing a list of books for the com
ing term which opens Monday, Sep
tember 25, and will.be in his office
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of next
"week for the purpose of distributing
them among the children who are re
quested to call at his office in the

The East Flat Ttock graded school
was opened Monday with an. attend
ance of JtfTwhich will be greatly In
creased as soon a all the children
get in. . -
: A number, o Ysitor& were presentt
among whom were Rev." A. Burgess of
the East Flat Rock Mfithedist church,
who read a scripture lesson and made
a most helpful talk to. the children.
Rev. Mr. Green, of Florida, a superan
nuated minister who spends each sum
mer at his summer bungalow at Flat
Rock, was also present and lead in a
most appropriate invocation. Rev. E.
L. Miller, of Greenville, S. C, a visitor
in the community, gave a very inter
esting talk and told the story of the
hardships of school life in a remote
inland section of Africa as told him
direct from the lips of a missionary in
that country. The comparison as
drawn by Mr. Miller between that
heathen, brutal treatment of children
in the method of teaching them their
few crude, bookless lessons of work
and the happy hopeful opportunities of
the schools in our christian land was
most pointedly emphasized and it ap
peared would subserve to awaken the
latent energy of every child present
and cause every heart to beat anew
with determination to make the very
best of his golden opportunity in
school days. - '

L. R. Strickler of Asheville, repre
senting a syndicate of hoted promo
ters, was in the city this-week con
ferring with W. Marshall Bridges, sec
retary of the Hendersonville Board of
Trade, with a view of getting local
people interested in building a new

outside capitalists were willing to put

whereby they can lease the hotel for
a period cf ten years, guaranteeing the
stockholders seven per cent dividends
on their . investment. Mr. Bridges is
talking the matter over with our citi

meeting of the board of trade for con
sideration of the proposition as was
nrst intended.
