McCOXNELLSDl'RG'S CHAUTAUQUA.
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
October 3, 4 aud 5. The Great
Literary Event of the Year.
The Chautauqua Mea is not a
new one. More than a quarter
of a century ago, one of the most
prominent men in the country
conceived the plan of bringing
the public together for a period
of time longer or shorter that
they might give themselves en
tirely over to the enjoyment of
that which instructs and elevates
the mind.
Thousands of town3 and cities
all over the country have availed
themselves of the idea, but it
was not until one year ago that
McConnellsburg fell in with the
movement. Of course, it was
only necessary to fall in. To fall
in meant to stay in. It was then
found that we might have the
benefit'of the best entertainers,
lecturers, and teachers at the
minimum of cost. It was found
that we could have at home en
tertainers that we would have to
pay seventy-five cents and a dol
lar for at Chambersburg, Harris
burg, or Philadelphia, for one
third of that Bum.
So well pleased were the citi
zens of McConnellsburg, that at
the close of last year's "Chau
tauqua," twenty-five or more
persons signed a contract making
themselves responsible for the
expenses connected with having
one in 1916. Every arrangement
has now been perfected; the pro
gram made; the time set. The
only thing remaining is to "whoop
it up" get everybody interested,
and make it a grand success.
It is not a money-making scheme
No free tickets for the promoters.
Everybody in it is working for
the good cf the community, and
the men who guarantee the sale
of the tickets, pay for their own,
same as other people.
What does it all mean? Simply
that it will be held afternoon and
evenings of each of the three
days, in the auditorium of the
High School Building. It means
that TWO first class lectures or
entertainments will be given at
each session, making in all twelve
lectures and entertainments. It
means that a ticket costing but
one dollar and twenty-five cents
will give you the privilege of the
entire twelve entertainments, a
little more than ten cent3 each,
by buying a season ticket.
The Chautauqua thus means
that you buy your entertainments
at wholesale prices. If you wish
to buy them singly, you will have
to pay retail prices, which is ne
cessarily higher.
The program for this year's
Chautauqua is simply great.
Tickets will be on sale at Sey
lar's Drug Store, at 1 o'clock,
Wednesday afternoon, Septem
ber 20th, when purchasers will
have an opportunity to select
seats in the auditorium and hold
the same for the entire time,
without paying anything extra
for the reserved seat privilege.
Do not forget the time and place.
Get in early while getting is
good.
Old Coin.
"Uncle" John Hann of Saluvia
and Chas. J.Eagan, of Midland,
Md., called at this office last Sat
urday. Mr. Hann had in his pos
session a silver three-cent piece
which he found along the Lin
coln Highway last Thursday be
tween Ed Hendershot's and J. A
Stewart's. What makes the
finding of the coin of especial in
terest to the finder is, that about
65 years ago he and his father
were going from Harrisonville to
Saluvia in company with the late
Samuel Sharpe. At the point in
road where the coin was found,
Mr.' Hann remembers that Mr.
Sharpe took a hand fulof ' 'change' '
from his pocket, dropping some
at the side of- the ioa-1. Mr.
Hann believes thnt the piect; he
found wad a piece that Mr.
Sharpe had failed to recover that
day.
Read Yonr Policy.
On most insurance policies
there is printed in plain letters:
READ YOUR POLICY. The
reason one pays good money for
insurance is. that he wants pro
tection. The policy is a contract in
which the insurance company,
party of the first pr.rr, for a con
sideration, agrees to do certain
things. The party of the second
part, agrees to do certain things.
It takes a lot of fine print on in
surance policies to tell just what
the insured must do in order to
make the policy valid. This is
hard reading, but it pays to read
every word of it, and then to
read it again.
There are very few agreements
that the average man will sign,
and know as little about what he
is signing as an insurance policy.
This is true of all forms of insur
ance whether it be life, acci
dent, or fire.
The average man feels the
need of protection. He consults
an agent or maybe the agent
consults him. The agent tells
him how much it will cost, the
applicant pays the money, the
agent delivers the policy. The
insured takes the policy home,
out it carefully away. If a fire
occurs, he turns to his policy, and
for the first time READS it. It
is then, for the first time, he dis
covers that there are conditions
in the policy that he was not
aware of conditions that practi
cally annul the value of the poli
cy. Do not misunderstand us. We
are not knocking insurance. We
believe in it. But we do want
that you shall read your policy
until you understand its provi
sions. Then you will know on
what to depend if misfortune
corne.
An Enjoyable Trip.
Last Sunday morning Mrs.
Virginia Brant, Mrs. Demaris
Davis, Mrs. Margaret Kesselring,
Chester and JEdwin Brant with
Edwin at the wheel motored to
Loysburg to visit Mr. and Mrs.
Harry Brant. The day was ideal
for such an outing, the scenery
grand, their appetites keen, and
the dinner well, it was just
grt'at! They staid at Harry's
until 3:30 o'clock, when they re
turned by way of Yellow Creek,
Hopewell, Wells Tannery, and
New Grenada, reaching their re
spective homes by 6:30. The
ladies enjoyed the trip immense
ly and they are profuse in ex
pressions of gratitude for Edwin's
generosity in giving them such a
nice trip.
Fell From Motorcycle.
One day last week, while a mo
torcycle carrying a man and a
woman from Johnstown was de
scending east side of Sideling
Hill, the woman was in some
manner, thrown off. A passing
auto picked up the injured wo
man and brought her to Dr. Mos
ser's office in McConnellsburg.
In addition to the shock, she was
slightly cut on the head and one
arm had some of the skin knock
ed off near the elbow. The in
jured lady was taken back to
Johnstown in an automobile.
Sheriff Garland Had a Tire.
On Tuesday of last week while
Stanley Schetrompf, near War
fordsburg, was passing Sheriff J.
L. Garland's former home in
Bethel township with his traction
engine, and burning old rails fcr
fuel, sparks set fire to the Sher
iff's wagonshed and before help
arrived the shed and contents of
white pine lumber was a mass of
flames and all were consumed.
A steel roof is all that saved the
house. A fortunate fall of the
ruins in an opposite direction
from the barn saved that' build
ing. Loss partly covered by in
surance. Mr. and Mrj. James O. Mallott
and children, near Saluvia, were
callers at the News office while
in town. last Saturday, , .
SODA FOUNTAINS AND SOFT DBIMS.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgicne by
Ssmjel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Corrmissioier of Health.
The soda fountain has become
a National institution. The fact
that it is universally used is not
however, to be taken as a recom
mendation. Naturally during
the warm months there is an un
usual hankering for cool liquids.
What the system really craves in
hot weather is water. Cool wa
ter not ice cold. There is a na
tural demand and one that should
be supplied.
We" have required a taste for
sweetened concoctions which mas
querade under the names of all
the fruits that were found in the
Garden of Eden and others nev
er heard of except on soda foun
tain advertisements. The bulk
of these are chemical products in
which no actual fruit is used.
They are seldom nourishing.
In very hot weather a glass or
so of these sweetened liquids will
often interfere materially with
the digestion and their tendency
is to lessen the normal appetite
for nourishing food.
Palatable summer drinks can
be made with the pure fruit jui
ces to which cool w ater is added.
Sherbets made in this manner
are far more palatable and re
freshing than the. sickly sweets
which are the common offering
of the soft drink emporiums. Ice
cold drinks irritate the stomach
and produce catarrh sooner or
later.
There is another factor con
nected with the serving of drinks
soft or otherwise which is open
to the severest criticism. In
many places the provision for
the cleansing of the glasses is
inadequate. Too often a hasty
souiing in a tank of water is the
only washing which they receive.
It is a well known fact that
washing utensils in cold water
is not sufficient to properly
cleanse them and destroy germ
life.
The evils of the public drink
ink cup have been thoroughly ex
ploited and all too often the soda
glass comes within this category.
Preliminary Educational Meeting.
The preliminary educational
meeting held at Needmore Sept
ember 5, opened with twenty
eight teachers present from the
districts of Belfast, Bethel, Un
ion, Thompson and Ayr which
speaks well for the teachers.
The meeting was called to or
der by our county superintendent
Trof. J. Emery Thomas. Mr.
Orben Ilebner was elected presi
dent and Mis3 Alice Brewer sec
retary. The first topic which was thor
oughly discussed was "The pro
fessional teacher." In the dis
cussion scholarship was consider
ed first in importance to become
a professional certificate teacher.
A teacher to be fully qualified
must possess other qualities than
scholarship alone, as our future
citizens depend to a great extent
upon the training received in our
public schools.
Second Topic: How should a
teacher spend his evenings dur
ing the school term? This topic
was well discussed. Mr. Scott
Alexander one of Ayr township's
most successful teachers gave
some very good suggestions on
this important subject. During
the five school days the evenings
should be spent in the teacher's
recreation and preparation for
the next days work.
Third topic: Conduct of a teach
er. 1. In school. 2. On the play
ground. 3. In the community in
which he resides. The conduct
of a teacher should be worthy of
imitation.
Fourth topic: How can teach
ers secure co-operation of pa
rents? If we can secure suffi
cient interest from our pupils, it,
will not be difficult to secure co
operation of parents.
Frof. Thomas gave a very in
teresting and instructive talk on
1 each topic which we feel will be
.of much benefit to the many
. teachers present.
I Alice K. Brewer, secretary.
For the Sake of the Babies.
Ilarrisburg, Pa., Sept. 1. As
a part of their campaign to com
bat infantile paralysis through
out the state, women physicians
identified with the suffrage or
ganization collaborating have is
sued a list of precautions in var
ious language?. To prevent in
fant dieapes, the suffrage physi
cians say it is necessary to ob
serve the following rule3 during
hot weather.
Clean bodies, clean finger nails
clean clothe, clean houses, clean
yards, clean food, clean water
and clean milk.
Finger nails short and clean.
Cut every second day. Dirty fin
ger nails are the greatest source
of sickness -even greater than
dirty milk. Cut finger nails do
not bite them.
Two tepid tub baths a day for
children of all sizes and ages.
Little clothing. A cotton shirt
sleeveless diaper and very thin
dress. No shoes and stockings
or bands. Guard the baby from
sudden changes in the weather.
When it becomes suddenly cold
put on stockings and an extra
shirt. Keep the hair short.
Plenty of sleep. Out of door
sleeping is excellent. Afternoon
nap for the growing children.
Babies should be left alone as
much as possible not handled or
carried about.
Screen houses and porches
against flies and mosquitoes.
Keep children out of the hot
sun. Do not take them down
town. Do not take them shop
ping. Do not let the baby sleep on a
pillow, It is too hot.
Plenty of good food. Under
three years of age no raw fruit,
melons, ice cream, ice cream soda
and candy. Children of no age
tea or coffee not even a taste.
Plentyof good milk and plenty
of good drinking water. Keep
milk cold and sweet.
A sick child should be kept
apart from others until the doc
tor ha3 called.
Castor Oil is a good cure-all.
Fault of Many Drivers.
Every automobile driver ought
to read the verdict of a Roches
ter coroner on the death of a wo
man who was killed by an auto
mobile while -crossing a public
street. He said: "The evidence
in this case shows plainly the
fault of most drivers of motor
cars in blowing their horn when
close to persons crossing the
street and depending upon the
startled person to get out of the
way. If the motorists would use
better judgment and would think
about stopping their car when
there is any possibility of strik
ing anyone, instead of sounding
their horn and putting the re
sponsibility on the pedestrian, a
large percentage of these acci
dents would be averted."
More Pensions to Widows.
A bill giving increased pens'on
to widows of officers or enlisted
men who served in the Civil War
the Mexican War, or the War of
1812 widows who have reached
the age of seventy years has
been passed by both houses of
congress. The bill provides that
such widows shall receive $20 a
month instead of $12 as at pres
ent. Widows of Civil war soldiers
dropped because of marriage to
another person, are restored to
the roll by the bill.
