Republican Governor Elected
By 13,000 Majority Over
Democrat.
SENATOR WINS BY LESS
18,226 Progressives of 1912
Mostly Returned To The
Old Party.
Portland Me., Sept. 13. Maine re
publicans reinforced by returning
progressives, won a victory at tho
election Monday. They eleett : a gov
ernor, an auditor, two Unit I I'tatcs
senators and four representatives in
congress and wresting control of the
state house of representatives from
the democrats, will be able on a joint
vote of the legislature to elect the oth
er state officers not chosen by popu
lar vote.
Carl E. Millikcn led his ticket, de
feating Gov. Oakley C. Curtis, who
sought re-election, by a plurality of
approximately 13,000.
Bert M. Fernald, republican,
seemed to have been elected for the
short term in the United States senate
and the same ratio of gain would give
htm a plurality of 9,500.
United States Senator Charles F.
Johnson, democrat, apparently has
been defeated by Frederick 'Hale by
an indicated plurality of 7,200.
The republican drift extended to
county offices, the greater number of
counties choosing republican county
attorneys find sheriffs. Ju

he offices
ecause the
holders are charged "with enforcing
the prohibition laws.
The vote! was heavy as had been ex
pected, for the campaign had been
waged with a determination not seen
in recent years. The country was
searched out for speakers of national
prominence and the greater number
of these battled on national issues.
The campaign was not particularly
hot for the two United States senator
ships and four places held by Maine
in the lower house at Washington,
National defense, the tariff and the
eight hour law for railroad men
loomed large in the speeches..
United States Senator-elect Freder
ick Hale tonight sent a telegram to
Charles E. Hughes who had shared in
the campaign, claiming that the vote
was an endorsement of the Hughes
candidacy for the presidency. Gov.
Curtis issued a statement asserting
that anything less than a republican
plurality of 15,000 would indicate that
the people of Maine wished to uphold
the president.
Maine Vote Analyzed.
That the democratic candidates in
M tine i ol ed a percentage of the pro
gressive, independent and stay-at-
home vote of former years adequate
to enable Woodrow Wilson to carry
the country by a large majorify, if the
same percentage is maintained in oth
er stater, is conclusively shown by the
final returns from Maine.
It is also true that the democratic
candidates for senator in Maine, the
vote for whom undoubtedly was cast
upon national issues solely, scored an
increase over the vote for President
Wilson in Maine, which if maintained
at the same rate throughout the coun
try, would give President Wilson a
majority of the popular vote of the
country and assure his safe re-elec
tion in November.
Johnson and Sills, the two demo
cratic candidates for United States
senators, according to the unoilicial
returns, polled respectively 17, 150 and
15,719 more votes than Woodrow
Wilson polled in Main in 1912 Wilson
got 51,113 votes in Maine.
Taft got 25,45 votes and Roosevelt
got 48,493 votes. This represents a
total of 126,151 votes cast for the can
didates of the three principal .parties.
In 1916 Senator Johnson polled 08,
273 votes and Sills T3ol!ad.fll,82 votes
as against 78,044 for Hale and 79,368
for Fernald, Johnson's gain over
Wilson's vote was thirty three par
.cant, and Sills' gain was about thjjrty-

HANDLE BUMPER CROPS
Newest Movement on Foot to
Bring Business To The
City.
County Agent Casey is working on
a proposition to provide a grain and
hay market in Hopkinsville that will
make a ready market for the immense
crop of corn and hay in Christian and
adjacent counties this year. It is be
lieved that the various mills and oth
er dealers will agree to handle all
that comes, exporting the surplus.
This arrangement is expected to be
made in a few days and then it is
planned to have a Club of Boosters
tour the surrounding counties in au
tomobiles and advertise the fact that
Hopkinsville is to be a wholesale
market for grain and hay as well as
tobacco, live stock, poultry and other
farm products. Towns that will be
visited on the first trip 'will be Pem

Russellville and Elkton. Other towns

LOST HAND"
UNDER WHEELS
Princeton Man Victim of
Serious Accident Here
Tuesday Night.
Robert Pepper, of Princeton, got
his left hand cut off by the L. & N.
accommodation train at the depot here
about 9 o'clock Tuesday night. The
train, which had discharged the pas
sengers, was pulling out for the round
table in the yards, when Mr. Pepper,
who was walking along the side of
the track, stumbled and fell. His
lift hand fell across the rail and was
severed at the wrist. Dr. J. B. Jack
son, the Company's surgeon, was
called and, arriving in a few minutes,
had the injured man removed to the
Jennie Stuart Memorial Hospital,
where he amputated the limb about
half way between the elbow and
wrist. Mr. Pepper was getting along
nicely yesterday. His wife and son
and daughter came up from Prince
ton yesterday morning and will re
main with him a few days.
Fairbanks Broke Down.
Oklahoma City, 'Okla., Sept. 13.
Charles W. Fairbanks, republican
vice-presidential candidate, suffered
an attack of indigestion tonight while
addressing a large audience at the
auditorium. For a time it was
thought he had been stricken with
serious illness. He was compelled to
quit speaking for 15 minutes and dur
ing the interval many people left the
building. After his recovery in an
ante room. Mr. Fairbanks finished
his speech.
one per cent This shows the tre
mendous addition to the normal
democratic vote in Maine due to tho
strength of Woodrow Wilson's case
before the people,
Fernald polled the highest vote of
all the Republican candidates in
Maine and his total, 79,368 represents
a gain of 4,330 over the Taft-Roose-
velt vote combined in 1912, about six
per cent.
A gain of thirty-one per cent, for
Wilson carried throughput the nation
upon tho basis of the 1912 total popu
lar voto would give him a plurality of
over 300,000 over the total nation
widft Taft-RooVeveM vote.

Springs To The City of
Hopkinsville.
DELEGATION CAME OVER
Tuesday To Present the Mat
ter To The Fiscal Court
And Promise Aid.
A large delegation of business men
from j Dawson Springs came over
Tuesday to appear before the Fiscal
Court to ask that Christian county im
prove the Buttermilk road and its ex
tensions to the county line and con
nect with the Dawson road coming
this way.

They came early and first met in
formally with several of the business

sition, after which John J. Metcalfe
provided several automobiles and
took the visitors for a trip around
town and out into South Christian.
In the afternoon they appeared be
fore the Fiscal Court with a local
committee named to assist them.
The court has set aside $40,000 for
this road and it is believed this will
the 8 or 10 miles of the old pike.
On their part the Dawson Springs
people agree to build a road from
their town to the county line, a dis
tance of two or three miles, thus con
necting Dawson and Hopkinsville
with a hard surfaced road all the way.
With a good road to Hopkinsville
and automobiles steadily growing in
numbers they say that this city would
be a trading place not only of the peo
ple living in and around that town
but also of the great crowds of visi

The Fiscal court gave them an in
terested hearing.

If Political Concessions Violat

America To Take Action.
Washington, Sept. 13. The Japan
ese government has officially inform
ed the United States through Ambas
sador Guthrie, that while it has made
important demands on China in con
nection with the recent clash at Cheng
Chiatum, there is nothing in the rep
resentations infringing .on American
interests by violating the open door,
Chinese integrity, or the Root-Taka-
hira agreement.
Whether the Washington govern
ment will accept these assurances as
conclusive, depends on the interpre
tation which Japan places on her
demands as her negotiations with
China proceed. Officials here are
uncertain as to Japan's relations,
though if was revealed today that in
an inquiry on the subject, the Japan
ese foreign office was not notified the
demands had "greatly disturbed the
American government."
Ambassador Guthrie reported that
the Japanese foreign minister con
firmed the outline of the demands
printed in this country as "approxi
mately true."
