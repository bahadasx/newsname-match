BUFFALO BILL
TO THIS CITY
Norwood Park is Engaged tor
Matinee and Night Perform
ances September 28.
The definite announcement Is
made that the Buffalo Bill (himself)
301 Hunch shown will exhibit in
Clarksburg, Thursday, September 2 8.
Norwood park, tho only site largo
enough, has been engaged for th??
exhibition grounds.
The amalgamation of these two
notable shows was one of tho amuse-!
ment surprises of tho season, but the |
result has Justified the experiment.
For one thing It means a larger and
morn representative exhibition, and
at the same time it has afforded op
portunities for introducing big and
novel features that would otherwise
bo impossible. Probably the most
interesting feature of the consolida
tion is the fact that Buffalo Bill, who
is undoubtedly a character of inter
national Interest, has returned to the1
saddle, and actively participates in
the performances. This in itself
would give the combined shows dis
tinction.
Militiiry Spectacle.
Another fact of unusual interest
i?? the new spectacular military offer
ing, "Preparedness", !n which the
United States war department has
taken such an active interest that!
furloughs have been granted a large
number of soldiers from the regular!
army, in order that the display may:
be a genuine picturization of I'ncle
Sam's defenders.
The purpose of the management, j
which has been effectively carried!
liulYalo llill (Col. WH'.iiun F. Cody).
out under the direction of John |
Raker, for many years the general,
director of the Buffalo Bill shows, j
is to present a series of military
maneuvers, illustrating the life of'
Uncle Sam's boys in khaki in peace
and in war?in the camp and on the
field of battle. There are, it is an
nounced, reviews showing the various
units of the military service: the life
in the trenches; the perilous work
in the scout and the sharpshooter; i
charges by cavalry and mounted in-'
fantry; artillery iu action, and other j
spectacular incidents of an offensive (
and defensive winy in being.
Old Time Bonier Warfare.
In connection with the "prepared- j
ness" display there is a visualization !
of the old-time border warfare, so I
closely Identified with the career of,
Buffalo Bill, in which scores of In
dians, led by the redoubtable old J
Sioux warrior, Chief Flying Hawk, I
and many other frontier notables
participate. The life of the far West'
and the bonanza cattle ranges is also j
strenuously illustrated.
There will be two performances
in this city, with a free street mili
tary and frontier pageant at 10:3ft.
An especially interesting inci
dental feature of the coming of the
show to this city will be a recruiting
tent, where enlistments will be re
ceived for Uncle Sam's regular army.
Ad car No. 1 is in the city today,
and a small .army of publicity men
is busy spreading tho glad news.
WOMAN IS AKRESTED.
Mrs. Santl Muslclo, an Italian j
woman, was arrested Wednesday'
night at her home at Northview by !
county otilcers under a charge of I
selling whiskey there and was taken j
to jail, but she furnished bond be
fore Magistrate T. C*. Nlcewarner \

GOVERNOR ATKINSON TAKES A
HOT SHOT AT THE DEMOCRATS
ROBINSON COMPLETES
SWING AROUND CIRCLE
i
Republican Gubernatorial Nom
inee Gets Enthusiastic Re
ceptions Everywhere.
Judge Ira 10. Robinson, of Grafton,
Republican nominee for governor, haa
concluded his preliminary "swing
around the circle" and will arrive in
this city on train No. 12 Thursday
evening to visit at the party's state
headquarters. Judge Robinson's next
important speech will be delivered at
Morgan town Monday night when lie
will attend a political rally, at which
United Slates Senator William E. Bor
ah. nf Idaho, will be the principal
speaker.
Officials at slate headquarters are
very much gratified over the cordial
reception Judge KobinHon has received
in the southern end of the state where j
he has been the last week. They have
kept in close touch with the situation
and say that it could not be better.
Judge Robinson got one of the most
cordial receptions of his whole trip In
Raleigh county, the home of Attorney
General A. A. Lilly, who was his op
ponent in the primaries, but who has
now declared that ho will support the
nominee and the ?reHt of the ticket
The nominee spoke at Beckley Monday
afternoon and at McAlpin the same
evening. At both places he was greet
ed by tremendous crowds.
Tuesday the nominee visited Prince
ton, Morcer county, and a large crowd
met him at the train. He was escorted
to tho court house where he held a
public reception, meeting hundreds of
the voters. Reports to headquarters
hern are that, he made a tlno Impres
sion, A cordial and enthusiastic re
ception was giveu. Judge Robinson in
Minefield, where he spent WedncKday.
The crowds in xU 1 the places visited
wen- aglhusiiuitlc.
The nominee's charge that John J.
Cornwell, his opponent, was the candi
date of "Hobs" Watson and other finan
cial barons, met with a noble response
in every section. The Watson stamp
on Cornwell is too apparent, no matter
how many times the Democratic nomi
nee may deny its presence. It is hard
ly probable, however, that he will even
deny If. The voters know that It is
there and will not accept Cornwell.
This is the gist of the reports to state
headquarters from the sections visited
by Judge .Robinson.

Old War Horse of Republican

for the Ticket.
SAYS HUGHES Is A WINNER
Cannot Be Held Responsible for
Decision in the Virginria
Debt Case.
Judge (Jeorg* W. Atkinson, o1

oh of Republicanism. who ranks sec

than ('.off as ii candidate for the title
of "Wont Virginia's grand old man,"
1h going on the stump. Official an
nouncement to this effect was mads
at Republican state headquarters
hero Thursday.
Judge Atkinson's Itinerary has not
yet been arranged by Morgan Owen,
director of tho speakers' bureau, but
it will probably Include speeches in
most of the larger cities of tho state.
The Judge, who is a former gov
ernor of the state and who, up until
a few months ago, was on tho bench
of the United States court of claims,
paid a visit to state headquarters on
Thursday morning and was imme
diately surrounded by officials who
pleaded with him to make a few
speeches for the party. Although
the judge has been quite ill for the
last few months with rheumatism and
Is not yet entirely recovered, ho
promised to take the stump and do
w? ? t|. -Moh
will bo considerable. Tho judgo ar
rived III lti> it Ull? .kUQ
Tuesday evening, and will return
there in a day or two.
Judge Atkinson was "hot under the
collar" over the Democratic attempts
to make political capital out of Jus
tice Hughes's opinion in the Virginia
debt case. He was also optimistic
over the prospects for Republican
success.
"I llnd no opposition at all to Judgo
Hughes," he said. "I think he will
be elected hands down?1 know it.
1 know that he will be elected.
"1 see the Democratic leaders In
the state are charging that Judgo
Hughes is responsible for the verdict
I against West Virginia In the Virginia
| debt case. This Is an outrage. There
I are nine judges on tho supreme court
i bench and all concurred in tho opin
ion on tho case.
"If any controversy should arise
the blame should be charged to Chief
Justice Fuller, a Democrat, who, bo
fore his death, took Jurisdiction of
tho case. Our West Virginia poople
do not believe that the suit was a
suit of the state of Virginia against
tho state or West Virginia, because
tho state or Virginia did not own one
cent's worth of the bonds, for which
the suit was brought, and yet Chlel
Justice Fuller, endorsed'by the whole
supreme court, rendered an opinion
that the supreme court had jurisdic
tion In the case. If nny Judge of that
court Is to bo censured. It should be
Fuller and not Hughes, who wrote the
final opinion In the case. In every
Instance tho court was unanlmoui
and ono judgo cannot be held respon
sible for preparing the opinion of the
court.
i uo noi oeuevo me people or our
Btato can be Induced to hold one
judge responsible for the aCt of eight
UHBOCiatOB.
"To use Justice Hughes's opinion
against him is unjust, unfair, and
borders on dishonesty.* It la Blmply
a case of a drowning man catching
at a Btraw.
"West Virginia Is a solid Republi
can state and wiU most surely cast
its electoral vote for Hughes and
Fairbanks.
"The result of the Maine election
shows which way the wind blows.
Champ Clark gave out an honest opin
ion when he Bald: 'We (the Demo
crats) got licked In the state of
Maine.*
"West Virginia Is a protective tariff
state and whatever the Democrat!
may say about It, the tariff Is the
paramount Issue In this campaign. It
requires about $2,000,000 a day to
pay the running expenses of our gov
ernment and the Republican party
has always raised the necessary funds
for government purposes mainly from
tariff duties and has never favored di
rect taxation. The Democratic Idea
Is Just the reverse of this policy; con
sequently the Republican policy will
be re-Instated, beyond question, at
the approaching election. I think
West Virginia will roll up Its usual
majority for the whole ticket. Politi
cal conditions look mighty good to
me."
