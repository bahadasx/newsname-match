Meade County Fair
Meade Couoty's Sixth Annual
Fair closed in a blaze of ilory
Friday night.
A better representation of the
fine stock, which has given this
county first place in the state,
has never been exhibited here.
The poultry, too, was far above
the exhibits of previous years in
that department. The farm
products, in quantity, were not
up to the average, but in quality
could not be excelled. Other de
pertinents were about as usual.
The races and other attrac
tions added a generous share to
the entertainment of the multi
tudes who came to see the ad
vancement Meade county it mak
ing. v v V,
In all, the Fair was a success
in every way and everyone is
well satisfied with the outcome.
We bad expected to publish a
part of the premium list this
week but were disappointed in
getting- tt set. ' Same will appear
next week. We kindly ask, bow
ever that those handing in this
material have it typewritten, for
the reanon that we have it mach
ine set, and linotype operators
very much dislike long band

Help Your Home Town
Mr. H. E. Marts, a representa-
tive of the Kansas Community
Betterment Service, spent an en
tire diy here recently interview
ing leading citizens and gather-
- ing data concerning social and
business conditions. Mr. Marts
expressed himself as greatly
pleased with the results of his
Visit, stating that he secured
valuable information to aid in
' the work.
"It is the work of the .Kansas
Community Betterment Serv
ice," Mr. Marts stated, "to gath
er and present to the people of
Kansas facts they should know
concerning their own state and
. their own communities. If Kan
sas country towns are to hold
their own the people must know
just what they will have to face
' in the years to come. If Kansas
people are to have good com
munities, good towns, good
stores, good markets, good
churches, good schools, good
roads, they must make these
things thenaBelves."
Mr. Marts while here ar
ranged for publication in this
paper, a series of talks by Wess
Goodwin, which will prove very
interesting to our readers. Mr.
Goodwin has given many years
to the study of economic ques
tions, his writings are widely
read, and he is in great demand
i as a Bpeaker before commercial
organizations. Mr. Goodwin be
lieves that if the country town
is to hold its own, it will do so
only through the co-operation of
the farmer and the merchant, as
the prosperity of each depends
. on the general prosperity of the
community.
We have a numbe. of real live
wire business and professional
men here and if all our people
will just take as much interest in
our town as these men are tak
ing, if they will co-operate with
these' men and give them the
support they should have, its fu
ture is assured. A few men
cannot do it all. It takes an earn
est effort on the part of every
good citizen to make a good
town. We have here men who
are willing and glad to give time
and energy and money to make
our town a better town, and a
little encouragement and help
from other citizens will result in
a great good to all.
; Below is the list of those sup-
'" porting this move. We gladly
print it so our readers may know
some of the men they can count
on every time a good movement
is started for the advancement
of our community:
F.W.FViek- '
National Pay Up Week
Mayor Adams has designated
the first week in October as the
time to square up debts. It is a
national movement, and Mea e
will join in passing prosperity
around in an endless chain.
The one fact that should im
press us all most, is, bow very
dependent we all are upon each
other. No one class can gain at
the. expense of all thi others
The factories cannot run without
markets for their goods. The
farmer can make no money if
there is none to buy his surplus
products, for, as the farmer
prospers, all prosper; as the
other commercial interests
the country prosper, the farmer
prospers. We must all look to
each other for our living. If we
turn into the channels of busi
ness the millions of dollars, that
we all owe each other, so thai we
can again use the dollars to bny
more that we need, every man
who is supplying a need will
prosper. That is the object of
National Pay-Up Week, October
2-7.
You can help and you can be
helped if you will pay up during
this week. Every business man
in Meade has pledged himself to
pay all bis hills that he can at
this time. Let's all work to
gether. Ben Latta Lost
Sunday evening, about dark,
the word was passed around that
Ben Latta, 64 years old, could
not be found. Mr. Latta. with
his son, Virgil ann wife, were at
the Jobn Jones borne for a few
days stay, That evening they
had all gone for an auto ride and
returned ashort time before tb
rain. The members of the fam
ily and Mr. and Mrs. Latta enter
ed the south door of the Jones
home, while Mr. Ben Latta went
around the house, supposably, to
enter the west door. When be
did not enter within a few min
utes, his son went into the yard
to look for him, but be was not
on the premises. Search com
menced at once, aod continued
until about midnight when he
was located in the back yard of
the A. T. Bodle home. Having
been in the rain so long, be was
badly chilled. Mr. Latta buffer
ed a stroke of paralysis a few
years ago, and a weakened con
dition of his mind resulted,
which is responsible for his
wandering away from the house.
His son and wife, and Mr, and
Mrs. John Jones have requested
that we assure all who helped in
the search of their appreciation.
Dress making and all kinds of
sewing at home or at the house.

The city water has been piped
to The Meade Steam Laundry,
and the management informs us
that they now have a sufficient
supply of pure water to do all the
laundry work in the city. They
are putting forth an effort to do
only first class work, and so long
as they do this, they merit the
patronage of our people. We
trust that they will receive a
sufficient share to pay expenses,
eat, and have a little left.

Danger of Gas in Silos
Topeka, September 1. Kansas
farmers who are filling their
silos just now should keep a close
watch for gas, particularly in pit
and cement silos which have few
openings or in the wooden silos
which are not provided with
doors. There have been no
deaths from asphyxiation in
silos this year, but there were
three last year and a little care
would prevent this.
When the water is poured into
the corn or the sorghums in the
silos it sets up a fermentation.
This fermentation gives off a
carbon dioxide gas which is rath
er dangerous as life cannot ex
ist in it. It is frequently found
in old wells and there are many
instances of men being asphyxi
ated in wells. The gas is heavier
than air and lies at the bottom of
the alo, crowding out the air en
tirely. It remains in the silo for
several weeks after the ferment
ation has, ended.
The pit silos and the cement
silos are, the most dangerous as
there is' rio way to get the air in
many of these so that the gas
can be driven out. Many farm
ers put the blower to work for a
considerable time each morning
to drive the gas out of the silo.
Others are not so careful.
"The farmers, before entering
any silo during the filling period
and after fermentation has set
in should never enter it without
taking the. proper precautionary
measures,' said J'. C. Mohler, sec
retary of the state board of ag
riculture. "The only way to be
sure of freedom from gas is to
lower a lantern into the silo. If
the light burns low or goes out
there is gas there in sufficient
I quantities to be dangerous."
i Kansas has thousands of pit
, silos in the western and central
I parts of the state and these are
the particularly dangerous ones.
They are nothing more than big
wells and there is no way to keep
them free of gas by opening the
Coots. . .-' ;
Pension Bill Passes
Many inquiries have been
made as to what had become of
the $20 widow's pension bill, so
for the benefit of those who may
not already know, we are glad to
have to announce that same was
signed by President Wilson on
September 8th and is now a law.
This is only one among the
many excellent bills passed by
the congress just adjourned, and
few if any will meet with more
aprovaL
We will publish within the
next week or two, more informa
tion regarding the provisions of
this bill, and also the necessary
steps to be taken in order that
each Widow may receive the in
crease due her, by the provisions
of this new pension bill. It must
not be', forgotten that our own
Kansas. Congressman, Jouett
Shouse. is responsible for this
act which gives to every deserv
ing widow a pension worthy of
mention. '
Dr. Roush has purchased the

Thursday afternoon a severe
.hail storm paid an unwelcome
, visit to the garden of Frank
Marrs, in the Artesian Valley.
iNo less than $1,000 worth of
. vegetables and melons were tot
ally destroyed, to say nothing of
his feed crop. The Ehason larm
was also visited, but less dam
: age was done. Some of the sheds
on the George Landis farm were
blown down. No other damage
i has been reported. '

Departed
Fr eda, the seven year old
daughter of Mr; and Mrs. John
Painter, was drowned, Wednes

that the other children bad gone
to school and this child followed
them as far as the creek where
he stopped to wade or fell if.
Her lifeless body was found a
short time later.
Interment was made in Grace
land Cemetery, September 14th.
A short service was conducted
at the grave by Rev. C. J. Spiers

Meade County Stock
C. S. Hulburt has just return
ed from Topeka where be took
"Hensol F." the yearling Gallo
way bull, which he exhibited at
the Meade County Fair. ' Mr.
Hulburt sold the animal to a
gentlemen in the eastern part of
this state, consideration, $500.
This is Abe sixth registered Gall
oway calf Mr. Hulburt has sold
this year, and the average price
receiyed was $277.50. - On his
place, South Wood Stock Farm,
two miles south of Meade are
eighty hiad of the same stock.
The sire of the calf sold was the
International Grand Champion
in 1916. A half brother won the
honor in 1912, another in 1914
and there is every reason to be
lieve that Hensol F. will claim
it in 1917. He took the blue rib
bon at the Meade Fair, and will
be shown ot the State Fair,, next
week.
A general rain visited Meade
county Sunday night. The pre
cipitation was about an inch, and
every inch went into the ground,
putting same in excellent shape
for plowing and planting, also
giving the feed crop a much
needed soaking. At the present
time the outlook is good for a
1917 wheat crop. May prosperi
ty continue to be unbounded in
good old Meade county.
Old Land Mark Gone
We are advised that Willis
Wolfe has purchased the site
generally referred to as "the
Mulligan cellar1' and has already
commenced tbe erection of a
modern, two story brick garage.
The erection of a building on
tbis corner will obliterate an old
land mark. Had tbe plans of
Messrs Mulligan and Hassett,
both now deceased, materialized
some twenty odd years ago, a
baodsome hotel building would
have graced the place, but as it
was, all that was accomplished
was tbe excavation of the cellar,
and when their hopes died with
the boom, it was Irft to he a men
ace and an ''eye-sore" for, lo!
these many years. ,
R. S Gerow advises us that a
third engine will be installed at
the Light plant within a short
time. Ere many moons Roscoe
will have the plant second to
none in the state.
J. E. Thornberry, a well driller,
is in the McCarty hospital and
the motorcycle of Deacon God
frey, junior, is on the scrap heap
as a result of a collision Sunday
between the motorcycle and a
Ford car, driven by John Lloyd
of Ford. Godfrey with Thorn-
berry on the motorcycle behind
him came south from liome to
turn into the Fort road. Mr.
Lloyd drove from the right side
to the left side of the Fort road,
coming west and the machines
struck at the edge of the road.
Godfrey and his machine were
tossed into the side of the road,
while Thornberry was dragged
about fifty feet by the Ford. He
is badly bruised and scratched
but lsjiot believed to be serious
ly injured.
The above in from the Dodge
City Globe. Deacon Godfrey is
a brother of Roy Godfrey of this
city.

Last Thursday evening at
Phelps Opera House tbe wrest
ling match between Clyde Collins
and Dick Cowan both of Meade,
Kansas resulted in a victory for
Collins, winning tbe first fall in
31 minutes and the second in 13
minutes. It was a good clean

A $15,000,000 Appetite
Manhattan, Kan., Aug. 5.
The Hessian fly in Kansas has a
$15,000,000 appetite this year.
In other words the pest devoured'
or destroyed wheat valued at
that figure, largely due to the
lack of action and co-operation
in the work of eradication.
Most of this damage could
have been prevented, declare
Professors L. E. Call, S. C. Sal
mon and C. C. Cunningham of
the agronomy department in the
Kansas State Agricultural col
lege in an experiment station
bulletin just published. The Hes
sian fly was present this past
season in all counties in the cen
tral part of the state and was
fairly well distributed over the
eastern counties. This docs not
mean that the fly always causes
damage in this area, but that it
has been found there this past
season and is, therefore, a source
of danger to future crops. The
Hessian fly can readily be detect
ed by examining the wheat stub
ble. If present in large numbers
the next crop certainly will be in
jured unless proper methods of
control are adopted.
There are two effective and
practical ways to control Hes
sian ny. One is to kill all the fly
in the -stubble and in volunteer
wheat before they can hatch and
lay their eggs in the grain. The
other is to destroy the volunteer.
Wheat and delay seeding so that
most of the flies will have ceased
laying eggs by the time the
wheat is up. .
The best way to kill the Hes
sian fly in infested stubble where
it exists in the pupa stage is to
plow early and at least four or
five inches deep. If the ground
is then worked down with a disk .
the fly will be burled so deep and
the ground above packed so firm
ly that very few of them will be
able to get to the surface.
Burning the stubble also kills
the few Hessian flies above
ground, but probably does not
kill the majority, which are be
low the surface. Since burning
destroys the organic matter in
the stubble, which is needed in
most Kansas soils, and does not
destroy a very large per cent of
the Hessian flies, it cannot . be
recommended as a general prac
tice. Early deep plowing, to be fully
effective, must be practiced by
the entire neighborhood, and
must include all infested fields
since the flies sometimes mi
grate considerable distance.
