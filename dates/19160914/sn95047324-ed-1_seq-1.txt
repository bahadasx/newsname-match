Socialist Peace Program
Eliminates Indemnities
and Land Annexations
By MORRIS HILLQUIT, Noted Socialist
I
I
TIIE Socialist pence program Beeks to bring about an arrangement
which will bo likely to guarantee perpetual international peace in
the future regardless of the faults of tho past. 'To bring about
such a peace tho Socialists are trying to eliminate all factors which have
been the most fertile sources of war among nations.
THEIR OPPOSITION TO ANNEXATIONS OF TERRITORY AND TO IN
DEMNITIES IS THUS ACCOUNTED FOR.
So also are the special points agreed upon at the recent Ilague con
ference the independence of Poland and tho establishment of a free
federation of Balkan states, a federation on the Balkan peninsula similar
to tho United States of America. The dismemberment of Poland and
the Tarious conflicts between separate states on that peninsula as well as
the punishment of France after tho war of 1870 have been amons the
causes of permanent friction in Europe. .
Further points in the inter-national Socialist pence program are re
duction of armament, establishment of an international court of justice
and, above all, the abolition of secret diplomacy, of tho hidden agree
ments made by the few committing millions of people to tho doing of
things they know nothing about, committing them to slay one another
wken they would bo friendi.
ALL OF THESE THINGS AIM AT THE REMOVAL OF ALL
CAUSES OF FUTURE WARS.
COMMENTS ON CANDIDATE CATTS
What Some of the Newspapers Are Saying About Him Criticisms and
Charges Which He Will Doubtless Answer in the
Campaign He is Now Making
We do not see how Mr. Blitch,
who is a good American citizon,
and has many lovely American
girls among his relatives and
close friends, can consider Catts'
remarks about high school grad
uates as something to be dismissed
lightly. We consider such re
marks as ruffianly insults to A

County Agents' Meet Will Inter

Plans for the annual meeting of
the county agents at the Universi
ty of Florida October 2 t "
sive are developing rapidly. A
tentative program has been issu
ed. October 2 will be organiza
tion day upon which rural or
ganization and cooperation will be
discussed; October 3 will be hor
ticulture day; October 4 will be
livestock day; October 5 boys'
and girls' club day; October 6,

vegetable crops day.
experts trom the United Slutes,
Department of Agriculture, from
the Experiment Station, and, the
county agents will take part in
this program. Lectures will con-,
sumc the mornings and discus
sions demonstrations and field
trips will fill the afternoons.
While the meeting is held pri
marily for agents, farmers are
urged to attend. This meeting will
not only be of educational benefit
to any farmers who care to attend,
but it will give them an insight
into the work which the state and
the nation are doing and trying
to do tor rural folk.. Problems in
uiltercnt counties and localities
will be discussed and a broader
view of conditions in the state can
be had by those who care to go.
It is probable that the "program
as given will be followed in gener
al, but additions will be made.
, A gentleman at our elbow says
that he believes that Catts will lie Catts was

chua in the senate, has the follow

cratic paper, the Gainesville Sun:
"In the recounts of votes in
three princts in Nassau county,
Wood cained 14, Hudson 10 and
Knott 1 for governor. It in quite
evident that there were numerous
errors made all over the state in
counting the votes cast at the pri
ma ry election, and it is also evi

Catts. The strictly neutral pa
pers of Jacksonville quoted Mr.
Catts as stating that the amount
was $30,000. Note that" in. every
place v has a different tale.
Truth is not one thing in one
place and another thing in an
other nlace. There is a good old
proverb which Mr. Catts ought to
have learned in his school days,
if he did not "falsus in uno, fal
sua in omniDus, which means
that if a man will ile about one
thin- io will lie about everything
The fact is, as every intelligent
person knows, Cardinal Gibbons
never gave $20,000, or $30,000. or
$80,000 to defeat Catts, and that
h "-ould not give twenty thous-
sand cents to do so. Tho whole
story is a concoct ion of Catts dis
ordered brain designed, as he ex
presses it, "to catch the Crack

There is a Chinese fruit called

There are several Lichee trees in
Florida, notably in the yard of
Dr. Richardson, anA W. S. Taylor,
oth of Tampa. The Roval Palm
Nurseries sends two of the fruit
to the Grower, stating that the
tree is hardier than the mango

posed to progress seems to be for

is in the majority. Ocala Banner.
It has been said that if a wall
were erected across thr entire

In his speech here, Rev. Catts
in endeavoring to bring into dis
favor the efforts of Mr. Knott to
have a fair, honest and accurate
recount of the votes in order to as
certain who is the, regular nom
ineethe real choice of the Dem
ocrats of Floridafrequently re
peated that all the recounts show
ed no gains for any candidate but
Knott.
Now, if Mr. Catts is as convers
ant with the figures reported from
the recounts as he acknowledges
to be in the art of religion and
politics, then he would know that
he is maliciously misstating facts
for political purposes only.
In our own Georgetown pre
cincts gains were made by Farris
anil Hudson, while in Duval, Su-
wanmw. Nassau and nearly all
the other counties contested, the
recounts showed gains for the var
ious candidates. As Mr. Knott
was more widely and favorably
known, it was but natural that he
should receive a majority of the
second choice votes on the Farris,
Wood and Hudson ballots.
Rev. Catts, being the radical
candidate, was "single-shotted,"
as a whole, hence he had few sec
ond choice votes to be counted.
These votes not being cast for
Rev. Catt, the recount accurately
made could not show him to have
made gains when there were no
gains to be made. But, if Rev.
Cats desires the public to believe
him the truthful and pure man he
claimed to be in his speech here,
then he must stick just a little
closer tn the truth, or at any rate
make statements which are not
false on their very face.
Relative to the recount, Editor
McCreary who represented Ala-
negligent in tallying the votes cast
for other candidates for Governor,
particularly the second choice vot
es. Hence the recount is merely
correcting these errors, and giv
ing each candidate every vote east
for him by the voters. It is as
fair for one as it is for the others;
so let the goo( work continue, and
let us see who is the real Democrat
ic nominee for governor. As
Knott is far in the lead, we fail to
see how Catts can hope to figure
except as an independent and in
the same class as 'Cyclone' Mit
chell. Loyal Democrats will sup
port the nominee." Palatka
Times-Herald.
The statement that Mr. Catts
said that Knott had been given
$20,000.00 by Cardinal Gibbons in
his speech here Monday night has
been denied, some Republicans
and Soicalists, who have not the
slightest right to partciipate in
Democratic councils, insisting the
amount was $10,000. Catts did

A fruit buyer recently told a
grower near Ulearwater that hi!
would give him a good price fo-
his bright fruit, but not a cent for
his rusty fruit. He cxplainel that
perhaps he might be b'o to
handle the marked fruit after
Christinas.
Mr, Grower, do you know what
this means? The fruit buyer
knows his business, lie would
show no preference if h could
make as much money from hand
ling the rusty fruit. He knows
that the market is growing more
critical of the fruit it buys. It
wants bright fruit. Are you pre
pared to deliver bright fruit?
Can you' do it every year, or is it
a matter of accident that you have
bright fruit this year? .

Telegram heard Mr. Catts make
this statement, and was careful to
note the amount, for the reason
that Catts had already made con
flicting statements as to this mat
ter. Several gentlemen called at
the Telegram office today and de
clared they would gladly make af
fidavits that the amount stated by
Mr. Catts was $20,000, and that
they could get 100 men who would
gladly sign their names to such an
affidavit. However, Mr. Catts
saved all this trouble by stating
in Tampa last night, that the a
mount contributed by Cardinal
Gibbons was $80,000! Think of

The purpose of this meeting is
to give the citrus grower the lat
est and best information on dif
ferent Subjects pertaining to the
growing and marketing of citrus
fruits. There will be four days of
instructive lectures, exhibits and
demonstrations. Each of the im
portant diseases and pests of cit
rus trees will be discussed. There
will be exhibits of these diseases
and pests showing important stag
es of their life histories. The lat
est information concerning these
troubles will be given. Methods
of prevention and control will be
thoroughly discussed. In addi
tion there will be lectures on fer
tilizing and ' cultivating citrus
trees, gasolene engines, spraying
machinery, the marketing of cit
rus fruits, bud selection, the new
farm loan act and a number of
other subjects.
The "dollar social" given by
tlw ladies of the Methodist church
in tho lobby of the Hotel Punta
Gorda last Friday night ( was a
success from all view points. The
attendance was even larger than
had been expected and so were the
receipts, which amounted to a lit
tle over $26.00. The object was to
aid the church in paying off the
balance of the debt incurred in
putting up the new building. The
program of the entertainment in
cluded vocal and instrumental
music by the best local talent and,
by way of refreshment, punch and
lemonade. All who attended en- '
joyed the evening to the fullest
extent.
There are few farm folk who
give enough attention to their
teeth. Dr. Wiley was not far
wrong when he said in the Pro
gressive Farmer recently that ev
ery good tooth is worth a thous
and dollars. Farmers as well as
city people should make it a habit
to go to a dentist regularly at
least once a year; and every child
should be taught the use of a
tooth-brush as religiously and
promptly as it is taught to say
Aow i lay me down to sleep."
