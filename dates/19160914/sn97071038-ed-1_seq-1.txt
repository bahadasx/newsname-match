Built Panama Canal Out of Current
Revenues, Patriotically Hoard
ing Bonds in Treasury Which
Democrats Filch to Hide
a Deficit.
REPUBLEGAN THRIFT IS
SQUANDERED BY WILSUN
William R. Willcox, Chairman ofl8uale lne "'molding of contracts
the Republican National Committee,
has received from Senator Penrose a
brief but positive summing up of the
extravagances of the Wilson Adminis
tration during the season of Congress
just about to close. The Senator
says:
"When the country realizes what
this Congress has done In the way of
appropriations it will be dumfounded
Already, it has been shown that over
a billion, seven or eight hundred mil
lion dollars have been appropriated
more money than was ever opproprl
ated in any one year In the history
of the American government. The to
tal will reach nearly two billion dol
lars before the end of this carnival
of debauchery in public expenditures
is reached, because no account has
been taken of the twenty-five millions
for the Donish islands, the thirty mil
lions which the government will pro
bably have to refund as a result of
the five per cent rebate "allowed on
importations brought across the seas
in American bottoms, and other mat
ters which are likely to come up.
"It Is only too evident that this bill
which is expected to bring in some
two hundred million dollars will ab
solutely fail to meet even the require
ments for the ill-advised and certainly
not urgent projects authorized by the
present Congress.
"It is now claimed that these pro
jects are to be financed by the issu
ance of Panama Canal bonds. The
Amerlcon people will regard such a
proceeding as a very queer one be
cause the Issuing of bonds by the
Cleveland Administration largely
helped to bring about the downfall of
the Democratic party in 1896. A
bond Issue has ever since been viewed
with abhorrence by the Democracy;
now, we find the party leaders com
pelled, by reason of their extrava
gance and Inefficiency to resort to It.
"To defray the expenses of a nit
rate plant and of a shipping board
and many other useless projects by
the issue of Panama bonds will be in
the last analysis equivalent to paying
for them by bond Issues. These bonds
are lying in the treasury unused as
the result of the thrift and economy
and wise administration of the Repub
lican party.
"Only about $130,000,000 of bonds
were put out in the construction of
the Panama Canal. The balance of
the cost of that stupendous undertak
ing was paid out of the current re
venues; and now, to advance the no
vel doctrine that these bonds which
represent the thrift of preceding
years shall be issued for these quest
ionable projects is, to my mind, pre
posterous, in fact, it was expressly
provided in the Spooner Act that Pa
nama Canal bonds should not be Is
sued for any other purpose than that
of the construction of the Canal, and
the Ingenious theory that they can be
issued now to repay the treasury and
that then the money can be squan-
dered by the party in power to finance

in the many exhibits on display.
The program will start at 8:30

mainly of foot races for the boys and

naa not got a line on some of his
doubtful projects and to make good a
deficit will not alter the fact that
such a deficit exists.
"No amount of reasoning on the
part of the Chairman of the Commit
tee on Finance will alter the fact
hat outside of preparedness there has
been at least $200,000,000 of wastefu
appropriations and expenditures by
the present Congress. That condition
or the treasury will absolutely neces-
ior Dauiesnips ana delay the whole
scheme of preparedness.
"The figures of the Secretary of
the Treasury may be juggled as they
may, but when the Secretary is up
aealnRt the hrilte taot nf tint having
money to pay for these projects he
will then find that figures will not
make a surplus in the treasury."
Members of the county court made
a trip into the upper Butter creek
country the first of the week to in
spect the Jackson Hill road. This
road is used by many of the farmers
in the lower country In hauling wood
out of the mountains and it Is the
court's '.ntention to make some im
provements there.

Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Severance of

patent papers from Washington for
a file set for a saw, which he invent
ed. According to young Gilliam,
who is only 17 years of age, his
invention is a simple one but better
than anything on the market at the
present time. He expects to reap
some financial benefit from his inven
tion. A deed was put on record at the
court house the past week which
transfers the Skinner creek ranch of
Minor Brothers to G. U. Krebs. The
deal was made in May 1914. The
price paid was $35,000 for 4200 acres
mostly grazing land. It is under

Minor have dissolved partnership,

IKE I0NE SCHOOL
OPENED MONDAY
(From Our lone Correspondent.)
Our high school opened on Monday
with a large attendance in all depart
ments; not so large, however, as can
be expected, owing to the fact that so
many are at work Vet in the harvest
fields. The enrollment in the high
chool has passed thirty and this will
be faereosed to fifty 'f feast', if not
more by the first of October. The
grades are filling up well and the ca
pacity of the school will be taxed to
its utmost when all the people move
to town tr-at are contemplating com
ing in foi- tho benefit of the school,
lone now has a standard frur-year
high school, the work of standardiz
ing having been completed last year.
The building is well supplied with
appratus, much of which has been
added for the work this year. Prof.
L. A. Doak, principal, will also teach
he manual training department this
year, a branch of the school work
that is much appreciated by the peo
ple of the district. From present in
dications this department will be fill
ed to overflowing and night classes
will have to be organized. Many not
regularly enrolled in the school will
take up this work and the extra clas
ses will have to be cared for outside
f school hours. The assistant teach
ers in the high school are, Jas. Coss
man and Miss Delia Jackson. Aside
from the classes they will teach the
former will have charge of athletics,
and the latter domestic science and
art. Much interest is being mani
fested in these two branches and both
these teachers will be called upon to
care for classes outside school hours
according to present indications. In
the grades, E. A. Doak teaches the
7th and 8th grades; Miss Mabry Cur
rin the 5th and 6th: Miss Maude
Wakefield the 3rd and 4th, and Miss
Anna Golbraith the primary depart
ment. A very profitable year Is be
fore the school and a number of for
mer students are coming in to take
post graduate work, preparatory to
entering more advanced institutions
of learning, all of which speaks well
for the splendid management of the
lone High School.

In 1S52 Ezra Mevker came out to
Oregon from Indiana. At that time
the trip conaumcd monUss of time and
was made in the old prairie schooner.

Pathfinder schoonerraoblle and mak

marked by months. Mr. Meeker has
been working lxrd the last few years
to mark the old Oregon Trail across
i
the cantiient. He is just returning
from Washington D. C. where he
worked for a bill before ' Congress
gress providing for the construction
of a great national highway as a step
toward preparedness. This highway
would be utilized for military pur
poses. While in Heppenr, Mr. Meeker and

Pendleton to take the Blue Trail
through Morrow County, and he was
loud in his praise of the thorough
manner in which the trail is marked.
"It ls the best marked trail I ever
saw," is the way Mr. Meeker put it.
When asked how soon he would
start back on anther transcontinen
tal Journey, Mr. Meeker replied that
there was nothing definite at this
time. "I am hurrying home as fast
as I can now, to work for the election
of Chas. E. Huges, our next presi
dent" said the pioneer. Mr. Meeker
Is now 86 years old, or 86 years young
it might be better to say, for he cer
tainly is a spry man for one of his
years. We hope we will have the
pleasure of meeting Mr. Meeker again
and no doubt he will be passing this
way bVfore long. Tor the story of
the Lost Trail will not be complete
until the highway stretching from the
Atlantic to the Pacific has In reality
been built. And when that day comes
the name of Ezra Meeker will stand
out in shinning letters, as the great
moving spirit behind it all.
