Sykes Declared Nominee
At the meeting of the State
Executive Committee in Jackson
Tuesday, Judge Sykes was de
clared the nominee by a majori
ty of 177 as shown by the official
returns in the hands of the com
mittee. Hon. Rush H. Knox
was present at the meeting and
filed a protest and it was reques
ted that he be allowed a hearing.
This, however, was denied and
the result declared.
Mr. Knox claims in his protest
that there were irregularities in
some precincts and this claim
was supported by sworn state
ments. Farmer and Boll-Weevil
A negro on Aberdeen Branch
was heard singing the following
song, the words of which were
copied by Mr. B. A. Porter:
Der furst time I seed Boll-Weevil
He wus sittin' on a cotton
square;
Der next minnit I lucked back
fer him,
And him and his whole d
familee wus dare.
Der Farmer he tuck Boll-Weevil,

And laid him on er cake o' ice;

Rogers' Greater Shows
Free Fall Carnival Here All Next
Week On the Streets.
Arriving in their own special
train of double length cars from
Corinth over the M. & O.
railroad. Sunday evening, the
Rogers' Greater Shows will im
mediately begin unloading and
erecting their various tented
structures which go to the mak
ing up of this gigantic amuse
ment enterprise.
It would be generally supposed
that a great deal of confusion
would be attached to the hand
ling of such a mammouth aggre
gation, but when one observes
Mr. Rogers and his several lieu
tenants directing the work they
will readily see that they ire
masters of the situation. The
discipline maintained by the man
agement is very strict, and no
member of the company, whether
it be man or woman, is permit
ted to conduct themselves" in a
disorderly manner, either on or
off the show grounds.
The Rogers' Greater Shows
have been for years considired
"America's most favorbly known
Carnival Company."
"Decency First" is the key
note of the management and a
special effort is made to please
the ladies and especially the
children.
It is expected that large
crowds will be in attendance
each afternoon and night
A series of free attractions
and band concerts have been ar
ranged to take place every after
noon and night next week upon
the carnival grounds. adv.
This Old Soldier
Is Still in Line
Gi'3 to Memphis Reunion and
Marches Three Miles in Big
Parade Gains 13 Pounds.
"If it had not been for that Tan
lac I couldn't haye gone to the
Confederate Reun.on at Memphis
on the 8th of October and march
ed afoot for nearly three miles in
the big parade," said Frank B.
Kendrix, who lives at 4800 Char
lotte Avenue, Nashville. Mr. Ken
drix is one of Nashville's oldest
and best known citizens.
As a member of Company I,
Second Kentucky Cavalry, Basil
Duke's Regiment, General John
B. Gordons command, Mr. Ken
drix saw service throught the
Civil War, and was woudned four
different times.
"During the winter," said Mr.
Kendrix'TsufTered intensely with
rheumatism, and when spring
time came I went all to pieces. I
had just about made up my mind
that my end was not very far off.
I looked like I was on the verge
of a general physical decline, and
I had about despaired- of ever
walking again. I am seventy
years of age, have fought
a good fight and have
proven my record, and was ready
to go. But since I got hold of Tan
lac I have set my head to round
out ninety years, and from the
way I feel now I believe I will
do it. Before I began taking this
medicine I was rapidly losing
what little strength and flesh I
had, and was so weak and debil
itated it was all I could do to
walk from the bed to the chair,
and even that required great ex
ertion. I had no appetite at all,
couldn't sleep to do any good and
was awfully nervous. My flesh
seemed too dry and I suffered a
great deal with headache.
" I doctored and doctored, but
did not show any sign of improve
ment. I attributed my failure to
get relief to my old age and de
clining physical powers. But 1
made a bad guess, because after
taking Tanlac two weeks I felt
better and younger than I had
felt in years. I am now on my
ninth bottle, and am actually
thirteen pounds heavier than I
was before I began taking Tan
lac. My clothes were too large
now they are too small, and I
guess -I will have to buy clothes
that will fit me comfortably. To
make a long story short the med
icine just seemed to fill me with
new life and energy and put me
right on my feet. I have a fine
appetite now.
"As I told you before, I can
now walk anywhere, and have
thrown my cane aside, because
I don't need it any more, except
for bad eyesight. I spent four
days in Memphis at the reunion,
and just tramped around all over
town with the boys. All around
were men who gave out during
the parade, but at the end I was
right there, and didn't feel the
least bit tired. I just got back a
few days ago, and am awfully
glad to tell you what Tanlac has
done for me. If I had the money
I would buy every old soldier a
bottle of Tanlac, because I be
lieve it would add years to their
lives."
Tanlac is sold in Okolona ex
clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,
and in Houlka exclusively by J.
W. HOWARD & SON.

The city school opened Monday
morning under circumstances
which point-to a most successful
year's work under an enlarged
and strengthened faculty with
a large attendance. The faculty
is as follows: W. M. Cox, Supt,
Misses Elbur Crighton, Omera
NcBeath, Corenne Blumbeberg
in charge of the high school
department; Mrs. Threse Cavin,
Misses Kate Bodenhammer,
Frances Jarmen, Annie Tate, Ida
Lee Kyle, grammar school de
partment; Miss Annie Gladney,
primary teacher; W. E. Roberts,
commercial department; S. A.
Renfroe, director of manual
training and athletics.
Quite a number of the patrons
were present at the opening hour
and listened to short helpful
talks by Mayor R. J. West, Rev.
A. L. O'Briant, Trustee E. J.
Henson, Mr. J. L. Lyon, Mrs.
Fannie Clark and Supt. Cox.
The building has been im
proved since the close of the last
session and many needful helps
have been added to the equipt
ment. It is expected that the
attendance will exceed any
previous year and the work
more efficient.
He Wouldn't Advertise
Breathes there a man with soul
so dead who never to himself hath
said; "My trade of late is getting
bad, I'll try another eight-inch
ad," If such there be go mark
him well; for him no bank ac
count shall swell.no angels watch
the Golden Stair to welcome home
the Millionaire. The man who
never asks for trade by local
line 6r ad displayed cares more
for rest than worldly gain, and
patronage but gives him pain.
Tread lightly friend; let no rude
sound disturb his solitude pro
found. Here let him live in calm
repose, unsought except by men
he owes. And when he dies, go
plant him deep, that naught may
break his dreamless sleep, where
no rude clamor may dispel the
quiet that he loved so well. And
when the world may know its
loss, place on his grave a wreath
of moss; and on the stone above,
"Here lies a chump who would
not advertise." Ex.
It is the candid belief of the
best writers and thinkers of to
day that the world is fast drif
ing away from the old order of
things.
Men everywhere are asking
themselves these questions:
" W7hat shall we expect next?
Why so much unrest and discon
tent throught the whole earth?
When will the European iwar
be over, and when will things
settle down to a normal condi
tion?" These and many other
questions of paramount import
ance will be ably discussed in
the light of Bible Prophecy by
J. A. Meggerson of Brooklyn, New
York at the Court House Okolo
