Wlien there is none.
Yes tbe word teach us that th
'time will come when the wurld
will cry for peace and no peace
to be had. And there is no need
for U9 to point to any certain
character or nation. For among
all nations today there is a cry
for peaca, But with all of tbis
there is a biger cry for war,
That is the rich are the criers
for war and tbe poor man does
their fighting and it is all for the
purpose of making slaves out of
tbe poor, after they get enough
of them killed o.I, so as to rule
the rest of thera,
STK1KE.
There is a great deal said about
the Strike especially about the 8
tour law being rushed thru
-congress, by President Wilson
the rich men say it is going to
bring about very hard tinus.
The only difference there could
be in the time 'then or hereafter
is this If the strike had of went
on tbe strikers would of ben tl e
looHers and the whole country
would of been the suffers. And
, now it will be the consumers
-that wiil pay the lo. And tbe
rich men the money goiters.
So Wilson choose the leaser evil
of tbe two as he would loot? at
it We shall give fc Bible answer
to this in a short time look for it.

Struggle for Commercial Su

DeBperatt-1-
WASHINGTON Sept. 9 -Any
proof that Great Britnln is using
any information secured from
intercepted neutral mail in her
struggle for commercial supre
macy, probably vould bo fol
lowed by vigorous steps by the
American government to secure
abandonment of the policy.
A statement mde during a
tariff debate in parliament by
David Lloyd-George, the British
war secretary, that such infor
mation properly could bo put to
any public and national use" is
regardsd by officials here as
opening the wav for practices
which would work inestimable
injury to American interests.
Wbtle the state department
declined to mske any comment
pending a full investigation of
the exact meaning of tbe war
secretary's declaration, there
were many evidence that thp
policy he suggested waa viewed
as unsupportable in internat
ional law.
Retaliation Is Possible.
Discussion of the subject
brought out the suggestion that
although the Pbelan amendment
denying use of American mall,
cable, telegraph and express
privileges to citizens of foreign
countries interfering with Am
erican mails was striokea out
of the retaliatory legislation
recently passed by congress,
the measure as enacted contains
authorizations which might be
construed as bread enough to
allow the president to retaliate
against unfair usa gf the cen
sorship. Many, officials believe that if
it can bo shown that British
firms have an unfair advantage
over American firms because of
legislation passed as result of
infor ma ion gained illegally
from tbe censorship, the pre
sident could forbid importation
to this country of the products
of whatever industries affected

comment at ton action of his
cousin President Wilson in
securing the enactment of the
recent eight-hour railroad law,
composed the greater part nf the
sermon of the Rev, Samuel H.
Woodrow in the Pilgrios Congre
gational church here today,
Stating that when any body of
men was able to force Its de
mands through congress without
regard to the rest of the
country's ideas, government
ceased and we had mob rule,
instead. The Rev. DrW0odrow

, , M
In detail. f
"A comparatively small element
was able to force its demands
through congress," be said,
"and the men who did this were
not underpaid. The railroad
laborers are better paid passibly
than any other class of labor.
They are paid more than teach
ers or preachers.
"No more pitiful spectacle can
be imagined than that of seeing
the president and congress in a
blue funk because they are
threatened with a tieup of the
country's business by a compar
atively smail proportion of the
population. A question of the
sort ought to be 'thrashed out
and looked into. It ought to be
reasoned out and looked at
conservatively. Instead it was
hurried through and tbe
demands of the men granted
without relerence to what tbe
majority of tne people think of it.
"When we have such conditions
it is no longer government by'
the people and fur the people.'
The manner ol tho recent settle
ment is enoueti to cause alarm
to every thoughtful bpliever in
our government. It is not a
question of submitting such
proposition to the people is is a
question of dictating to tbe
president nnd congress, 1
"In speaking en such topics I
have often bad to comment upon
the aggression and selfishness
of capital as well as upon the
igovanceand bardaritp of labor.
The president matter is one
however, we all should consider
seriously." '

It was largely a "silk stock

laughed when in appealing for
offerings he told them that they
were "lousv with money."
He said in part:
" Why, an angle of heaven

Archeologlsts Find
Pharaoh's Palace.
UNCOVER THRONE ROOM
WHERE MOSES OAVE
KING ULTIMATUM:
Prom the Chicago Herald,
Digging deep into the grave of
the romanio Egypt that Is gone,
the Egypt of Pharaoh and tbe
captive children of Israel.
American archeologists have
laid bare the very throne room
in which Mosos, the most por
tentous figure of the 'Old Testa
ment, aud bis brother Aaron
gave to the King of JEgypt the
ultimatum of the Ten Tribes. ' '
Dr. Clarence S, Fisher, leader
of the Eckley B, Coxe. Jr. expe
dition has telegraphed tbis
startling news back to civilization
For several months this party
of excavators have been at work
in Memphis digging down for
ruins of an age now only Known
by Biblical reference and by
vagub mythical hints in venera
ble histories. It was assumed
that at Memphis, in the northern
part of Egypt. Meremptah the
Pharaoh of the buok of Exodus
in tbe Old Testament, bad his
palace.
Huge excavations were made
near the peculiar pyramid which
stands there, for it was suspect
ed that the buildings of this
long gone age would have been
placed near this:
Such proved to be the case,
for one day the machinery un
covered tbe voof of a great build'
ing half ruined but still erect,
packed in, and held by dirt cen
turies undesturbed. An army
of native workers gradually
stripped off tbe loam and expos
ed the palace of the Pbaraobs.
In it they found still in order,
a museum of curios rare even in
the days of the Exodus, Mer
emptah was shown in a new
light, shown to have been a man
more careful of posterity then
the story of his persecutions, as
narrated in the book of Exodus,
would indicate.
Strange old impliments, uten-
used back in 'he old days. How
the world has progressed."
In tbe center of this palace
was found a magnificent throne
room where tbe ruler of Nile
I land held his court. It is 60 by
1 40 feet in size, and still is, for all' ,
I tbe dust and silence in which it
1 has slept; a noble and inspiring
chamber.
On its lloor are the same flag
stones upon which Aaron at the
Command of Moses cast down
his rod and saw it, at the power
of the Lord, turn into a serpent.
