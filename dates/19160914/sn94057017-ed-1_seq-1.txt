Inasmuch as the Estancia fair
cannot be held until after the
state fair, it is going to be an
impossibility to make a good ex
hibit for this county at the state
fair without the active co-operation
of the farmers. County
Agent Harwell will do his best to
make a creditable exhibit for the
county, but in order to aid him
and make the display as good a
rrne as possible, all those who
have stuff that will do to go
should bring it in not later than
the fore part of next' week.
Don't neglect this.
R. A. Marble says he was of
fered 5c a pound for beans from
the machine, but did not sell
Some of the buyers of the coun
ty say the market will not justi
fy this price at present, and
when a man pays it he is betting
on an advance. Very few beans
are being contracted, because
the farmers will not sell at prices
offered What a contrast be
tween this time and four years
ago! Then it was not a question
ONE DEAD IN
FIGHT AT ABO
William Owen, an inspector
for the Cattle Sanitary Board,
was shot through the right lung
and Jesus Bailes was killed at
Abo Monday morning.
Owen was put on the train and
taken to the hospital at Albu
querque, where latest reports
say he is getting along well and
if no complications ensue will re
cover. Owen was attempting to ar
rest Bailes on a charge- of cattle
stealing, and was assisted by his
nephew, Charles Banghart, and
Joe Scroggin, Hugh Anderson,
Al Wood and Edward Hicker
thorn, the four last named resi
dents of the vicinity.
An inquest held on the body of
Bailes resulted in a verdict the
substance of which was that
Bailes came to his death by gun
shot wounds at the hands of
William Owen while resisting ar
rest. The precise facts in connection
with the shooting are not easy to
come at. Owen was not able to
talk and the others were not able
to give a circumstantial account
of the affair.
It seems, however, that Bailes
was in an adobe house in which
there were no other men, but a
woman or two and a child.
Owen, Banghart and Anderson
entered the house to make the
arrest. There was a fusillade of
shots, and the three came out,
Owen shot through the lung.
Bailes then made a break, and
there were more shots, Bailes
falling dead. It is not known
whether he received his death
wounds in the house or outside.
Bailes is a nephew of Domingo
Bailes, who was charged with
the killing of Col. Chavez at
Pinos Wells some years ago, but
was acquitted.
6 AND 7
At the meeting on the fair
question last Saturday it was de
cided to hold the fair on the 6th
and 7th of October.
A constitution and by-laws
were adopted.
A committee on finance was
added to the list of standing com
mittees, consisting of Robert
Burrus, J. N. Bush and J. L.
Stubbleiield. This committee
we learn has so far met with
good encouragement and success,
and give it as their opinion that
they will be able to raise suffi
cient money to have the best fair
yet. f
AH the committees were in
structed to be ready to report
next Saturday, at which time it
is thought arrangements will be
finally completed, and it will be
possible to announce the list of
premiums the following week.

he could sell.
A moon light picnic was held
in l auque canyon on last Thurs
day evening in honor of Mr. and
Mrp. Marvin Wisehart of Horton,
Kansas, and Mrs. Elmer Bishop
of Austin, Texas. A huge camp
fire was built and coffee and
brdled bacon served with the
supper which consisted of all
srts of good "eats" from fried
chicken to watermelon. After
supner the guests toasted marsh-
mallows, played games and told
stories until a late hour. On the
way home the Ford objected to
crossing creeks and the other car
tried to climb all the stumps near
the road, but by much persua
sion and many kind words they
were finally coaxed out of the
canyon- Those in the party
were Mr. and Mrs. Wisehart, Mr.
and Mrs. Elgin. Mrs. Bishop.
Mrs. Dee Robinson. Miss Chance
Evans. Miss Annie Porter, G. C
Dennis and Jesse McGhee.
CHILDREN WILL GO
TO STATE, FAIR
Boys and girls in Club work
are happy these days. Those
who remained faithfully in the
work are about to reap their har
vest of good things. The County
Agent in his rounds in arranging
the contests to select the winners
of the big prizes finds every child
aglow in the prospect of a whole
week at the State Fair without
expense with all of the club
workers in the state doing the
greatest things possible for
their comfort and good time. It
is a great pleasure for the work
ers to see the appreciation in the
children. We wish that we
might take them all.
There are girls in the bean and
corn clubs as well as in the cook
ing and sewing work. They
point with pride to their acre of
corn or beans or request the at
tention of the visitor about the
barn where their chickens are to
be found. The boys are equally
interested. The hard back
strengthening work sometimes
flavored with tears resulting
from the behavior of the family
team is now a thing of the past
and the nation's new farmers
are looking forward to their re
ward. Don't believe that the fair is
the whole thing, The children
have in dollars and cents the re
sults in sales from their work for
parents will see that this money
will reach the little pocket to
gratify whatever desire they
may have. Again, the two fairs
of Torrance county are putting
up money for the children by ar
ranging for special exhibits for
those who remain at home. They
will all go one place or the other
with smiles which can come only
upon the completion of some
work well done.
The children will go to the
State Fair in autos. Nothing
too good for them. The County
Agent has arranged with the fol
lowing public spirited men to
meet this need: Mr. Burt. Moun
tainair; Mr. Peterson, Valley
Auto Company. Estancia: Mr
Burton, Estancia Lumber Com
pany, and the County Agent
with his car. Mr. Burt, county
superintendent, is of course di
rectly interested in the children's
welfare. The other men fall in
line because they believe in mak
ing the little ones happy.
All parts of the county will be
represented. Wherever the
children have completed their
work the trips are being arranged
for. About 111 children aré
completing their work and 13
will receive first prize, one from
each of the clubs completing its
work. Let's all help for a larger
representation next year. The
winners will be announned next
issue.

County Agricultural Agent.
WOMAN'S CLUB
The Woman's Club held its
regular meeting at the club room
Friday afternoon. The reports
of the officers were interesting
and proved that much thought
and time had been given to the
work. The librarian reported a
new shipment of books, had just
been placed upon the shelves,
and Harold Bell Wright's new
book, When a Man's a Man, will
soon bé with them.
The semi-annual election of of
ficers was held and the following
were elected: Mrs. J. L. Stub
bleiield, president; Mrs. R. G;
Roberson, vice president; Mrs.
H. C. Williams, secretary; Miss
Annie Porter, treasurer. A sur
prise lunch was served by Mrs.
Burton, Mrs. Green and Mrs.
Kelly. ,
The next meeting of the club
will be at the home of Mrs. Ralph
Roberson, September 22nd.
