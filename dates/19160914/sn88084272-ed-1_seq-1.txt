Carranza officials have asserted that
thfir purpose was to foster small oper
ators and to compel the abandonment
of large land holdings retained for
speculative purposes only.
Consider Attitude on Border.
In their conference with Gen. Bliss,
the American commissioners took under
con-ideration the advisability of pro
posing sucb a system of border patrol
.i.n. .. ,.9ri nf the Mexican troops now-
engaged in this duty would be released
. for the pursuit of bandits at a dis-
Lance from the line.
They considered also the attitude of
mericans living along the border, as
reported by Gen. Bliss and obtained
from that officer estimates as to the
number of soldiers necessary to put
into effect any of the plans suggested.
DUcum Flat Money Situation.
One series of complaints now to be
considered has to do with the attempt
ot the Carranza government to compel
merchants and corporations to accept
paper currency at a rate far in excess
of its current value. The attention of
the Mexican commissioners was di
rected to instances in which military
commanders had. through decrees,
th-eatened with death any person who
refused to accept paper currency at its
v- par value, and for a similar offence
Stilso had threatened merchants with the
confiscation of their property.
The Mexican commissioners pointed
out that in so vast a country it was
htimanlv impossible to guard against
all possible abuset. but they 1 .id em
phasis on the fact that while such ei
; riocrees had been issued by sub
ordinate military commanders, the
national government has constantly
urged moderation on the state gov
ernors and that they had no record of
o cincle instance in wiiicii anj wi i
tiiri-me penalties had been
inflicted.
