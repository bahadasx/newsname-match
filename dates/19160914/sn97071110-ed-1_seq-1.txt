and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the

We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give GREATER
value.

NEW SYSTEM OF WORK PROPOSED
Prospective Plan Calls For But Two Road
Districts Federal Fond to Be
Asked For
The fate of Hood River road eon
struction for the next year ia in the
balance. Whether county road work
will continue next year under the old
system of supervisors, each in charge
or a small portion of the community. or
whether a more efficient new method
shall be inaugurated, will be settled by
the citizens themselves, at a meeting
to be called by the county court on
Saturday, September 23. Such waa
the plan, as outlined Wednesday night
last week by a committee of 24, the
various members of which represented
all county and city interests, including
the Commercial Club, the granges of
the county, the county court and the
city council.
It was proposed at the meeting that
Uood Kiver county next year be divid
ed into two road districts, one as small
as possible and the other to be com
prised oi the remainder of the com
munity. Ibis plan was devised be
cause of an existing law that provides
that the county court shall divide the
county into road districts. It would be
preferable to local road enthusiasts
that the county In tho entirety should
comprise a single road.distirct, but ac
cording to legal interpretations, at
least two districts must be provided
lor. lhe construction or the county
roads, in case the new plan material
ises, will be placed under supervision
of a competent road engineer, and im
provement of old rods and building of
new ones will be carried on under a
general system. While a minority of
the committee of 24 are opposed to the
plans under way, the entire committee
has agreed to the plan of allowing the
will of the people of the county ulti
mately to rule, and the county court
has expressed a willingness to give the
new plan a trial, provided concerted
expression of those present at the pro
posed meeting aemanas sucn an action.
Last week a meeting was attended
by J. T. Schuyler, of Portland, a road
engineer of the Office of Good Roads
of the United States Department of
Agriculture, who spent Wednesday af
ternoon with County Engineer Hurl
burt in an inspection of local high
ways. The proposed new road plan will
follow closely the system already put
into effect in Multnomah county.
"under our existing road laws,"
said D. G. Cruikshank, "no one is to
blame lor the inefficiency of road con
struction. But under our new scheme
we hope to set away from the expen
sive and ineffective work that in the
past has necessarily been accomplished
by road supervisors, who are appointed
by the court to take charge of the road
work in their respective small com
munities. Roads are built weii in in
stances under the old law, it is true,
but there is no regsrd to the benefits
that will accrue to the entire commun
ity."
It was announced at toe meeting
that the county court would make ap
plication through the State Highway
Commission for federal funds, as pro
vided under the recent federal road
act, to be used for the construction of a
trunk line road through the Hood Riv
er valley to connect the Columbia high
way with the Loop highway extending
around the base of Mount Hood to the
old Barlow road. Since applications for
the federal fund to be appropriated be
tween now and June 30, 1917, must be
made before October 1, the local appli
cation will be a provisional one, ac
companied by a brief, asking that
Hood Kiver county receive a portion oi
the federal money provided a bond is
sue can be voted and a survey made of
the proposed trunk road bisecting the
orchard districts.
WILD GOATS PROVE
TO BE ANGORAS
For the past several weeks parties of
mountaineers who have made the as
cent of Mount Hood have been contra
dieting the statements of authorities on
Northwestern natural history by re
Dorts of having sighted wild sheep or
goats high on the snow fields of the
peak. A drove of the ammais, near
the summit of the snowpcak, huddled
under the shelf of a glacial precipice,
was recently seen by Hans and Paul
Hoerlein. William Marshal. W. B.
Arena and Ned Crawford, who made
the entire circuit of the mountain.
the mystery was explained last week
by P. H. Mohr, a young Upper Valley
homesteader who was in the city on
business.
"It's my herd ol Angoras run wild,"
said Mr. Mohr. "I purchased the ani
mals to assist in the clearing of brush
land. Tbey soon lost their dometsic
tendencies there in the mountain wilds,
and now I have completely given them
up. I waa wondering what had become
of them when news came that they had
been seen on the snowfields by moun
tain climbers."
LIEUTENANT BROSIUS
TELLS OF CAMP
f.iantAnant Rrnsiui. Comnanv 12. C
A. C. O. N. G., who is now at Fort
I hImi nartirintinff in the citizens'
training camp, writes aa follows to the
Glacier:
"Thinking that you might welcome
anything in tbe way of data which
would assist you in keeping alive the
keen interest recently arousea in nooo
River in military affairs, namely, the
organization of 12th Co. C. A. C, O.
N. G., I am taking the liberty of mail
ing you excerpts from tbe program of
our daily activitiea here at Fort Law
ton, where we were removed from
Amercian Lake, pending the arrival of
the Washington National uuara iroin
the border. As you can readily see,
all of our time ia taken up with the
business of soldiering and we are left
little time or disposition for gadding
about. The main thing to be noted ia
that tbia camp is for the training of
officers for the regular, or other army
service. After three seasons of auch
instruction, followed consistently by
some study in between, one is eligible
for a commission in the U. S. army.
The work which we are getting here is
intensive, six months time ia uaually
devoted to this same course in toejreg
ulsr service.
"Hood River is especially fortunate
in securing a company of Coast Ami
lery. It ia by far the most interesting
branch of - the aervice. in that it com
bines infantry and artillery work, and
ia limited to aervice in coast defense
fortifications. Everyone with whom
we talk about our organisation predicts
a large measure of success for it. The
most common expression is. 'Ob. yes
Hood River has a live bunch, it will
make good all right.' So you see that.
in spite of the hard sledding we have
had, by keeping a stiff upper lip our
reputation nas remained unimpaired.
Certain it is that you have seven good
boosters in tbe neighborhood of Seattle
right now, and Seattle, aa you know, is
not at all slow when it comes to boost
inc. itself.
"Messrs. Wilbur, Hershner, Shoe
maker and myself are going to visit
fort Warden this afternoon to Inspect
the very complete coast defense equip
ment installed there. Next Sunday we
will got to tbe Bremerton Navy Yards.
"We are schedueld to break camp on
the 23d and expect to return to Hood
Kiver that same night In the mean
time, if there is any particular data
which you desire, I will be pleased to
forward the same to you.
GRAND TRUNK GRANTS
DIVERSION PRIVILEGE
Fruit shippers in the northwest will
welcome news which has just been
given out by F. L. Norman, general
agent of the Grand Trunk Railway of
Seattle, to tbe effect that his company
will pubiiBh effective as soon as possi
ble. the privilege for diversion of fruit
shipments after arrival at destination
on their line.
"We have been working on this for
the last three years," said Mr. Robin
son, traffic manager of the Northwest
ern Fruit Exchange. "California ship
pers have been permitted to divert
shipments originating - in their
state, after arrival at destination on
the Grand Trunk Railway, and have
the thiough rate to final destination
protected, while shippers ef the north
western states were denied the Tight
to divert to any point beyond after ar
rival at destination without being com
pelled to pay a local rate from point of
diversion to final destination. We were
able to convnicre the Grand Trunk offi
cials that they were' restricting distri
bution, which every railroad wishes to
increase.
Mr. Robinson says: "Much credit
must be given to Paul Weyrauch, of
Walla Walla, president of the Fruit
Growers' Agency, for his cooperation
in presenting the shippers' needs who
the officials of the Grand Trunk Rail
way. This Aeency has about 80 per
cent of tbe fruit output of the North
west affiliated with it."
This decision should be of great ben
efit to shippers who export to eastern
Canadian points reached Dy the urano
trunk Kaiiway.

LABOR SHORTAGE
IS SPENDING
MANY APPLE PICKERS SOON NEEDED
Floating Labor Population Said to be
Drawn to Lnmber Camps, Which
Are Running Full Swing
Anticipation of a shortage of labor
ia tbe fly in tbe ointment of Hood Riv
er orchardists at tbe present time.
Ready to begin the harvest of one of
the largest crops in the history of the
district, growers and the managements
of sales associations are at work on a
solution of tbe impending picker prob
lem. The floating labor available last
year la lacking this season. With lum
ber plants in most, all Northwestern
districts in full swing, local sawmills
and logging camps have found it no
easy task to fill their ranks this sea
son. According to C. H.Castner. in charge
of the warehouse of the Apple Growers
Association.more than 3,500 harvesters
were used in the picking and packing
of the crop of Hood River applea last
year. Mr. Laatner says that three
timea the number of last year will be
needed the coming season. Of course,
large portion of tbe harvesters of
last year season were furnished by the
families of growers themselves and by
tbe local working population.
Fruit growers will be aided in their
demand for pickers by tbe United
States Immigration Bureau, which dur
ing harvest time establishes an office
at local warehouses.
In view of the labor ahortage the
board of directors of the Apple Grow
ers Association declares that it can
take no positive stand on the prices
that shall be paid for labor. Tbe
board, however, makea the following
suggestions, which are said to be in
line with the financial conditions of tbe
Northwest: Labor for harvesting, 20
cents per hour ; for packing from grad
ing or sizing machines, three cents per
box? packing Jfrom tables, four cents
per box.
lhe Association haa arranged for an
advance of 25 centa per box to growers
on delivery of applea of the standard
grades and variteies on delivery at the .
local shipping and cold storage termin
als.
The Association has announced the
following budget for the coming year:
Fancy and etxra fancy apples will be
charged five cents per box for adver
tising ; C grades two cents per box and
all inferior gradea one cent.
The handling and sales charge of
fruit will not exceed 10 cents per pack
age. A maximum charge of 10 centa
per box wU be assessed for storage.
To raise a reserve fund for the purpose
of financing growers in the harvest of
their crops and to purchase materials.
the Association will this year levy an
assessment of one cent per pbox on all
packagea for which a chager of 10
cents for handling ia made. Where the
handling charge is less than 10 cents
tbe tax will be proportionate.
REVENUE STAMP TAX
HAS BEEN LIFTED
The stamp tax on proprietary articles
of drugs and legal documents, auto
matically ceased to exist at midnight
Saturday, when a new revenue bill
passed by congress became a law.
Postmaster Keavia was in receipt bun-
day of the following letter from Milton
Miller, of fortiand, internal reve
nue collector:
"I am in receipt of advice from the
Department at Washington that all
stamp taxes under Scehduels A and B.
documentary and proprietary, will be
discontinued at midnight tonight, lbat
is to say, any documents issued or cos
metics compounded subsequent to Sep
tember 8, 1910, will not require the
revenue stamps. It is my undertsand
ing that all documents issued subse
quent to December 1, 1914, up to and
including September 8, 1916, will re
quire stamps the same as heretofore.
You will, therefore, advise all your
customers to this effect.
'In order that you may clearly un
derstand the situation, 1 will say fur
ther; any instrument or paper hereto
fore requiring stamps and dated from
December I, 1914, to and including
Septebmer 8, 1916, will be stamped aa
formerly; but anything dated after
September 8, 1916, will not require to
be stamped."
