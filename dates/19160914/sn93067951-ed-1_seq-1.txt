BRITTSVILLE
Situated between WesTfield Creek
and the State line, and extending as
far as the Pee Dee river, lies an unnamed
section of Chesterfield County
which we would like to introduce to
the readers as Brittsville. It is a
beautiful section of farming country,
and its people are wide awake farmers,
using the modern methods of
farming with splendid results.
Through the good management of
Mr. Rouse, the County Superintendent
of Education, we have at last
secured a nice brick school building,
which is a credit to any community.
"The Woman's Home Demonstration
Club" meets there once a month under
the supervision of Miss Mims,
wnose interesting iuiks ana neipiui
suggestion? are enjoyed by all. Never
more can speeches be made condemning
the County for allowing
such a dilapidated structure, called
a school house, to exist; never more
will the old building as a school house
be an eyesore to passersby; for now
we have a building to be proud of,
and under the efficient teaching of
Miss Nora Pegues, we expect the
pupils to progress rapidly.
Miss Mabel Rivers left last Tuesday
for Statesville, where she will
attend the Presbyterian College al
that place.
Mr. Howell Rivers, who has beer
visiting his parents, Mr. and Mrs
R. L. Rivers, has gone to Eliot, S. C.

Belk Dies of Injuries;
Assailant Gets Awaj
On last Saturday afternoon excite
ment in Chesterfield and Cheraw ant
all the country between was runninj
high. Word had flashed over tht
whole of this territory with incred
ible swiftness that a negro had at
tempted to kill Mr. William Belk, o:
near Cheraw, that a two by foui
scantling had been used with ter
rible effect and the white man hat
small chance to recover.
The details of the affair were a1
first megre, but it was known that t
liiri'O nn.QSP W?a lnnHntr fnr fKn on
sailant and that blood hounds fron
. Columbia were to be put on his trail
Many went down from Chesterfielc
to aid in the hunt and to see the
hounds work.
Mr. William Belk was a road over
seer and it it said that he had foi
some time tried to Ret Elwood Grace
who is also known as Gradon and
Fuller, to do his bit of work on the
road. Grace is said to have disputed
the claim of Mr. Belk on his services
on the plea that he was only nineteen
years of age and that he had not
been in the territory long enough
even if he were of the proper age.
According to the best information
securable, Mr. Belk, while driving in
a buggy last Saturday afternoon, at
about 1:30 met the negro, who was
in another buggy with a white man.
A dispute arose between Mr. Belk
and the negro and it is said that
strong language was used. Mr.
Belk, it is said, left his buggy And
attempted to pull Grace from his
seat. The latter got out on the
opposite side and took to his heels
across an open field, with Mr. Belk
in pursuit. In his attempt to stop
Mr. Belk from following him furthei
Grace first threw a clod of dirt in
the white man's face and this failing
to huve any effect, he hurled a brickbat
with such force as to shattei
the unfortunate man's jaw. Then
picking up a two-by-four scantling,
the negro dealt Mr. Belk several severe
blows about the head and face
fracturing his skull across the forehead.
Mr. Belk was hurried to the Hamlet
hospital in a critical condition,
where he lived until 1:30 Monday
morning.
The pursuit and assault were said
to have been witnessed by several
men, both white and colored, but nc
effort seems to have been made to intervene,
nor to apprehend the assailant.
Though the whole territory was
scoured by hundreds of citizens and
blood hounds from Columbia wert
put on the trail, Grace made gooc
his escape. He was traced approx
innately eight mile* into Marlbon
county, where the track was lost.
Grace, or Fuller, bears a rathe:
dubious reputation as a fnrhter. I
will be reculled by Chesterfield peopb
that a few months ago there wa
some excitement in town over th<
story that a white man had been bad
ly cut on the Spencer place nea
town, and the story turned out to b
greatly exaggerated as it was a col
ored boy who was cut in a fight wit
one of his own people. Grace wa
the recipient of the wound in tha
' case and bears two large scars o
his face as a result that will probabl
aid in his identification.
The funeral services were conduct
ed in Cheraw and the burial oceurre
. at the Cheraw cemetery.

Mr. J. E. Sowell, Jr., Panel Away e
The many friends of Mr. J. E. ^
Sowell, jr., were shocked and grieved tl
to hear of his sudden death, which
occurred at his home here Sunday at y,
12:30 o'clock. Mr. Sowell seemed to
be in his usual health Saturday morn- Vl
in}?, but after eating dinner he had an
atta'-k of indigestion. Later in the
afternoon he felt better and went up
the street and spent some time talk- :tl
ing with his friends. He rested very t!
I well during the night, but was sick ...
| Sunday morning, though his condi- |
tion was not considered alarming,
J until about 12:30, when he suffered
what appeared to be a stroke of appoplexy
and died suddenly.
Mr. Sowell was a member of McBee
Presbyterian Church and had
been superintendent of the Sunday
school for the past thirteen years. He
was always faithful to his church and
smile and pleasant word for everyone
he met. Mr. Sowell was an old
soldier, seventy-five years of age. He
belonged to Company A, 7th South
Carolina Battalion. He has gone now
to join his many comrads gone before.
The funeral services were con
ducted at the Presbyterian Church
Monday afternoon at d o'clock by his
pastor, the Rev. A. W. White, as
sisted by the Revs. Thomas, of Cheraw,
Forbis, of Bethune, and Lawson,
of Ale Bee. s,
The body was laid to rest in the
' McBee Cemetery in the presence of
a large number of sorrowing friends
ind relatives. The grave was completely
covered by a large mass of
ocautiful flowers.
The following children survive
him: J. E. Sowell, jr., of Raliegh,
X. W. 1). and Henry Sowell, of ii<
McBee, and Misses Tommie, Attic O
ind Annie Sowell and Mrs. Belle
Morton, of McBee. A host of friends 01
md other relatives mourn his death. e\
We extend our deepest syr.pathy iii
to the bereaved ones in this their ai
hour of great sorrow. sj
