THE STORY OF THE
ELECTION IN WILLIAMS
At the primary election in
Williams last Tuesday, the elec
tion boards were a little late with
their organization on account of
the absence of a clerk. At both
poling places a hunt for some one
to fill the place was instituted.
In the first precinct the board'
was ready to receive and record
votes at 7:10 and the first vote,
that , of F. S. Herr, was cast at
7:15. In the second precinct the
clerk was found a little earlier
and the board was in working
condition at 7:00 sharp. The
first vote cast was that of F. M.
Gold at 7:40.
, With Banners Flying
It was a very common predic
tion that the primary election
this year would be the most hot
ly contested of any so far. Cer
tainly candidates for county and
precinct office were working with
might and main to score in Wil
liams. Kverything was being
done which candidates and their
friends thot would gain a vote.
Many candidates possibly all
had workers distributing cards
and using such powers of persua
sion as theymay have possessed
to gain votes for these paying for
their services.- In addition to
these, candidates had partisans
who were working no less effec
tively. A number of candidates
had large banners prepared an
nouncing their candidacy and
the banners, if not actually fly
ing, were flapping in the breeze.
Among them could be distin
guished F. S. Herr, George Herr
ington, T. F. Holden and Pat
Johnston whose candidacy for
the office of Supervisor was thus
announced: the name of C. E.
Larson, candidate for represent
ative and Charles C. Jones,
candidate for county attorney,
were displayed on banners artis
tically designed.
Good Natured Discussion
Small stoud3 gathered on the
streets and engaged in good
natured discussion and rallery.
No one felt sore, as far as could
be noticed 'by a casual observer,
and one would predict that the
result of the election will be ac
cepted iy all with the best of
feeling. .News from the Maine
election was received in the
morning :and that gave a topic
for discussion. Democrats held
that there was .nothing discou
raging for them in the result
Tvidle republicans seemed to get
quite a hit of comfort out of the
early reports.
How the Vote Grew
The .growth of .the early morn
ing vote would indicate that no
one meant to leave other morn
ing duties unattended to before
performing the duty which the
franchise imposes upon each
qualified voter. Gradually the
voters drafted into the polls.
At noon the vote stood 63

At 5:45 197 votes had been cast
in the second ward. The elec

the next ten minutes. It seemed
then that the last vote had been

The present school enrollment is
303.
The- physical laboratory is in
stalled and regular work in labor
atory experiments is proceeding.
The assembly period provides
for one of the most helpful and in
teresting features of our school
work. During this period ad
dresses ere delivered by persons
outside of school, reqnisitioned by
Miss Keating who has charge of
the assembly work., and reportB,
debate", speeches, musical rendi
tions, etc. are given by the stu
dents. The contributions given
thus far by the students show an
abundance of talent in the school.
Last week Mr. T. H. Cureton
gave an instructive and stimulat
ing address entitled, "The Value
of Education" which was much
appreciated by students and fac
ulty. Miss Bull, our teacher of
mathematics, gave an illuminat
ins talk describing her recent
travels thru Canada. The wonder
is that Miss Bull was not impres
Bed into military service by John
Bull. We felicitate ourselves on
her escape. In last week Tues-
day's assembly Walter Finney dis
cussed the strike situation.
Our assembly period extends
from 3:30 to 4:00 p. m. All per
sons are cordially invited to attend
Athletics and Gym. Work j
Week before last we organ
ized a Basket Ball tiam, The
"try-out" squad elected for its
Captain, Levi Montgomery and for
manager Mr. Dale, one of the
coaches We consider ; ourselves
very fortunate in having two
coaches this year: Superintendent
McFadden who has dealings with
teams in the various schools with
which he has been connected, and
Mr. Dale, our gymnastic, director.
Our practic work will be held on
Tuesday and Thursday evenings
and we ahall be glad to have any
town people who would like the
practice to join us.
There are a number of hopeful
gymnasts in school and we hope to
be able to give the public a good
exhibition some time this year.
Some of the students have already
tried some break-neck feats, re
ceiving good falls.
The School Board has bought
more gymnasium equipment, in
cluding a Volley Ball net and an
Indoor Base Ball equipment.
Below is presented the vote forV'
the state of Maine for the last . 46
years, up to and including 1912.
This vote is worth a careful an
alysis. Both republicans and dem
ocrats will get some comfort out of
it but both will be left in a state of
dcibt as to just what value may
safely be put on the plurality with
which the republicans are credited
in last Monday's election.

predominently republican. 5.00

the first ward having 153 and
the second ward 182. If the first
indications as to the political
composition of the vote was cor
rect, .the democrats were voting
at the close.
The Percentage Cast
The registered vote of Williams

365, or 65.3 per cent. The reg
istered democratic vote was 260

inquest over the body of Fred
Gore who was instantly killed at
the A. H. T. Lumber Company's

On last Monday Alec Sed was
taken before Judge Twitty on a

ly .conduct. The judge imposed a
fine df $10.00. This case came
from the Eas-t side where so large
a per cent of the misdemeanors
are committed.

1912 Combined republican
and progressive
It will be noticed that with only
three exceptions the republican or
the combined republican and pro
gressive plurality wa3 more than
20,000. Iu 1876 with a republican
plurality of 16,477 Mr. Tilden, a
democrat was elected but counted
out by the electoral commission.
In 1884 with a republican plural
ity of 20,060 Mr. Cleveland, a dem
ocrat, was elected. In 1892 with
a republican plurality of 14,979,
Mr. Cleveland, a democrat, was
elected. Just why. Mr. Garfield,
a republican, was elected in 1880
with a republican plurality ,in
Maine of only 8,868, is hard to un
derstand. If a rule could be safely
deduced from the above, it would
be that with a republican plurality
of less than "20,000 -.the democrats
have at least an even chance to
win. The plurality of 12,000 re
ported as a result of Monday's elec
tion in Maine would have to be
considerably increased in Novem
ber to establish a probability of
republican victory in the national
election.
The vote of 1912 was accidental
and must be disregarded, t-xcept -that
it may be taken as an indica
tion of the strength of the demo
cratic party in Maine. With a
plurality of the opposition vote of
23,925, Mr. Wilson, a democrat,
was elected. This would seem to
indicate the correctness of the rule,
thai the republican plurality in
Maine must be at least 20,000 to
establish the probability of repub
lican victory in the. national elec
tion But, the uncertainty of politics!
Who can make a rule in politics
which the voters may not break at.
the next election?
