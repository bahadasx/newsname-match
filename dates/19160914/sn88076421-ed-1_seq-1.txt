SURPRISE FOR
AND HIS WIFE
Three Hundred Members of Congrega­
tion Give Rev. and Mrs. N. Nil
sen Flattering Farewell
Members of the Zion Lutheran
church of this city and of the Trinity
Lutheran church of the North Prairie
surprised the popular pastor and.his
wife, Rev. and Mrs. Nicolay Nilsen, at
the close of the services last Sunday.
The affair was in the nature of a fare­
well to Rev. and Mrs. Nilsen, who will
leave shortly for Willmar, Minn.,
where the reverend has accepted the
charge of the Zion Lutheran church.
When the pastor and his wife step­
ped into the church basement at the
close of the services they were con­
fronted by three hundred members of
the congregation and they were taken
by complete surprise. A fine dinner
was served in the Assembly room aft­
er which Martin Jacobson called the
meeting to order, acting as toastmas
ter.
Halvor L. Halvorson reviewed at
length the excellent work done in be­
half of the church by the tireless pas­
tor during the fifteen years that he
has been located in Minot and said a
great many complimentary things
about Rev. and Mrs. Nilsen which are
all as true as gospel. He referred to
the timet when Mr. Nilsen took charge
of the little old church in the north­
western part of the city. Minot at the
time was a mere cowboy village of
about a thousand inhabitants. The
congregation grew steadily and a few
years ago through the efforts of Mr.
Nilsen the magnificent new church
was built. This is now free from
debt and is regarded as one of the fin­
est edifices in the city. On behalf of
the members of the congregation Rev.
and Mrs. Nilsen were presented with a
nice sum of money, just a little token
of the high esteem in which they are
held.
Mr. Nilsen responded the best he
could under the circumstances. He
went back over the good old days of
fifteen years ago and reviewed the
pleasures of his work among his peo­
ple up to the still better days of the
present. He spoke feelingly and said
that although he would occupy a new
field, he would never forget his kind
friends in North Dakota.
John Helset of north prairie spoke
cn behalf of the Trinity congregation.
O. Watne, a member of the board of
deacons also gave a talk and the last
speaker was Martin Jacobson, who
has always been one of the best work­
ers in the church.
Mrs. Nilsen, who possesses a re­
markably sweet voice, sang a solo.
Supper was served at seven o'clock.
Rev. Mr. Nilsen will preach his fare­
well sermon Sunday, Sept. 24 at the
Zion Lutheran church and he will
also preach for the last time at the
Trinity church next Sunday.
Rev. J. R. Michaelson of St. Paul,
who has been secured for the Minot
charge, cannot come before Christmas,
'but the pulpit will be supplied during
the meantime.

PROF. THEO. WANNER
Former Member of Fargo College Fac­
ulty Drowned in James River—Had
Been Under Great Mental Strain
The funeral of the late Prof. Theo.
Wanner, whose body was found in the
James river Sunday, was held from
the home of his sister-in-law, Mrs.
I^ed Wanner, at Jamestown, at 10:30
a. m. Tuesday. It was private, only
relatives and a few intimate friends
attending.
Dr. C. H. Phillips, pastor of the
First Congregational church of James­
town officiated. At noon the body was
taken to Pingree, where interment will
be made in the family lot.
Prof. Theo. Wanner disappeared
from the home of Mrs. Fred Wanner
Thursday morning^ Search was kept
up all the time until Sunday at noon,
when the body was found. "Death by
drowning" was the verdict of the cor­
oner's jury. It is believed that the
man committed suicide.
Professor Wanner had been under
great mental strain for some time,
having studied very hard at the uni­
versity of Wisconsin, where he work­
f?"" »H)ii«y».| |ppg|wfpp»wi|wnyn 'yy—" •WW!*' wwwiiiuiwwp •"""".' 'fwy
'I' W"'w*sry^f
ed for his doctor of philosophy de­
gree. The fact of his resignation
from the faculty of Fargo college also
seemed to have preyed upon his mind.
He also seemed dissatisfied with his
position with the Science school at
Wahpeton, being afraid that the order
of things would not work out well.
He was 40 years of age. He had
been identified with Farg^ college for
six years, being head of the physics!
and chemistry department. He was
at one time superintendent of schools
at Wahpeton, and formerly an instruc­
tor at Wimbledon.
While in Fargo he resided on Sixth
street south with his mother. He was
well liked and made a large circle of
friends.
WAR MAKES VALUE FOR OLD
FALSE TEETH—PLATINUM
The old false teeth that hang on the
wall, you did not think they were val­
uable, did you? Perhaps their mas­
ticating value has disappeared but
they still possess a high mineral value.
Our old friend, the war, is responsible.
There are two pegs in each tooth
about the size of a pin head, and so
valuable has platinum become that it
pays a good profit to buy all false
teeth.
A substitute is now being used by
the dentist, so unless your old teeth
are 5 years old they are not of much
value.
Platinum has leaped 100 per cent
since the war begun and it is now be­
ing sold at $85 per ounce, while at one
time it sold for the small sum of $5
per ounce.
KENTUCKY DOG WON THE CUP
Towner, Sept. 13.—The Continental
field trials closed here Thursday with
the running off of the sweepstakes
event won by Lewis C. Morris, a Lou­
isville, Kentucky, dog owned by L. L.
Haggin and handled by W. D. Gil­
christ of Courtland, Alabama, who
has his training camp northwest of
Towner. This is the highest honors
that can be won by a dog on this con­
tinent and they were the second won
by this dog in the trials, as he took
first in the all-age stake which were
run off the first day of the meet.
Nineteen dogs were entered in the
championship and the competition was
exceedingly keen. The event was not
closed until near dark, it being nec­
essary for the judges to run several I
of the dogs a considerable length of
time in order to make the eliminations
and pick the winners.
STILL FIGHTING IN THE
BELL SCHOOL DISTRICT
About a year ago there was an ac­
tion in the district court to compel the
directors of Bell school district to erect
a school—the petitioners having shown
that there were 22 children who had
no school without crossing a deep cou­
lee which could not be crossed by team
and which necessitated their going
around several miles.
The district court decided that the
petitioners were entitled to a new
school and so ordered. The directors
took the matter to the supreme court
and were beaten, the supreme court
ordering that the school be built. The
directors have not yet complied with
the order of the supreme court and the
petitioners are getting their dander
up. They claim that all objections as
to roads, etc., have been removed, the
county commissioners having put in a
fine long grade to let the children go
west toward the proposed site.
The petitioners claim that the only
reason for the delay in getting the
school is just a little local politics and
the fact that two children who live on
the east side of the school and who are
benefitted by its being kept away from
the 22 children are relatives of mem­
bers of the board.
There is now an election pending to
decide whether or not school number
2 is to be removed so as to accommo­
date the children who live on this side
of the deep coulee and if it does not
carry the directors will have to com­
mence the building of a new school
house without delay or the petitioners
will be after their scalps so it is prob­
able that the school will be moved and
save the expense of building another
school—although the petitioners claim
that the directors have no thought of
expenses but that they have spent
more money in going to court to keep
the school from their children than
would build the new school. The trou­
ble is probably just started. There is
a report that the directors will try and
saisfy the petitioners by giving them
a teacher in a farmhouse nearby, but
that will not satisfy the petitioners—
they feel that, having won a fight,
they are going to stand pat and get a
school that is permanent as the court
decided they are entitled to.
Arrested Nearly Car Load of Negroes
Nearly a car load of the colored
gentry, to be exact, just fourteen of
them, were arrested in Webb's and
McCree's colored addition to the city
of Minot Tuesday night. They were
charged with running disorderly
houses or being found in the same.
They were assessed the limit. The
coffers of the city were enriched to
the tune of $247.80 that day just from
fines alone. The following day the
fines amounted to $108.00. The po­
lice are bound to clean out this ele­
ment if stiff fines will have anything
to do with it.

RYDER HAD FIFTEEN
Flames Broke Out in Billion Real Es­
tate Office, Consuming Several
Buildings—$8,500 Insurance
Fire, supposed to be of incendiary
origin, broke out this morning in the
real estate office of J. H. Billion and
before the progress of the flames could
be checked nearly an entire block
on one of the principal streets of the
city had been consumed. The city has
excellent fire-fighting apparatus, be­
ing supplied with an immense cistern
and gas engine for pumping purposes.
The firemen worked valiantly but a
strong wind from the northwest fan­
ned the fiances and had it not been for
the excavation for the new First Na­
tional bank building it is believed the
whole town "would have gone up in
smoke. The loss on the Johnson block
will exceed $2,000, with no insurance.
Kelley Brothers' pool hall, loss $8,000,
with no insurance. The loss on the J.
H. Billion building is $400 and no in­
surance was carried. The loss on the
contents of this building is given in
excess of $400. The Dave Larin build­
ing which was consumed was valued
at $1,800, insured for $1,000. J. F.
Colonial, who occupied the Larin build­
ing with his pool hall, places his loss
at $800 and no insurance. Emil Poppi,
who had a complete set of carpenters
tools stored in the basement of this
building, estimates his loss at fully
$100. Plate glass windows in the
stores of George Kruger and the Sweet
Hardware on the opposite side of the
street were broken, entailing a loss of
several hundred dollars. These losses
however, were fully covered by plate
glass insurance. The total losses ag­
gregate fully fifteen thousand dollars,
with but $8,500 insurance.
Sunday a Miserable Day.
Sunday was one of the most miser­
able days this section has ever known.
The wind blew at a sixty mile clip all
day long. The air was full of dust
and dirt and the good housewives
found plenty to do the next day or
two getting rid of the dust which
found its way into the house. A num­
ber of hay and grain stacks were
blown partially over and at Burling­
ton James Johnson reports that the
wind overturned a large wagon and
rack. No special damage was done.
NEW HIDE AND FUR
HOUSE TO OPEN IN
Northwestern Hide & Fur Co. Will
Start Business on North Main
Street on October 1
The Northwestern Hide & Fur com­
pany will be opened at 49-51 North
Main street October 1 by H. L. Glazer
& Co.
Mr. Glazer is not a stranger in our
city for he has been engaged in the
Gent's furnishing business here fori
years. For several years he has been
conducting a very successful business
at Makoti. He is a hustler, a good!
square fellow and will build up a nice
business. He considers that Minot is
growing and believes there is room for
another concern of this nature.
Foxholm Farms Change Hands
Although the crops around Foxholm
were short, considerable real estate
has changed hands at good prices,
Martin Nelson bought the Geo. Arnold
unimproved quarter for $5,000 and Mr.
Arnold bought quarter section farms
up the valley from John Gruber and
Wm. H. Schoellerman, turning in a
quarter on the Gruber transaction.
Visit From Former Merchant
B. D. Glazer of Council Bluffs, Iowa,
for years engaged in the women's
ready-to-wear business in Minot, ar­
rived this week for a visit with his
many old-time friends. "Dan" has dis­
posed of his Council Bluffs store and
will engage in the women's cloak and
suit business at Fort Dodge, Iowa, a
live city of 24,000 population. His
friends will be pleased to know that
he has been doing well in Iowa. Mrs.
Glazer, who has been seriously ill, is
gaining slowly.

JUDGE WALLACE
AT DEATH'S DOOR
Prominent Burlington Mine Owner
Suffered Second Stroke of Paraly­
sis Wednesday Morning.
Judge J. S. Wallace, one of Ward
county's best beloved citizens, lies at
the point of death at his home at Bur­
lington and fears are entertained that
he cannot possibly recover. He suffer­
ed a stroke of paralysis Wednesday
morning, and during the night it was
feared that he could not live until
morning. He is still alive at this
writing, but physicians say that his
demise may be expected at any time.
Judge Wallace suffered a stroke of
paralysis some years ago and practi­
cally recovered. He has been engaged
in the coal mining business at Bur­
lington for years and is regarded as
one of the best mining experts in the
west.
THIRD PITCHFORK ACCIDENT
OCCURS AT JAMESTOWN
Jamestown, Sept. 11.—A series of
accidents from jumping upon pitch­
forks have occurred recently and the
third one is reported today. Theodore
Konkel, a young man 19 years of age,
who has been working for Richard
Bouch, near Fried, for a couple ox
weeks, was in an empty grain wagon
and tossed a pitchfork out, the tines
sticking in the ground, leaving the
handle sticking upright. On getting
out of the wagon the young man
jumped backwards, and accidentally
struck the handle of the pitchfork,
causing a serious and terribly painful
injury, the handle penetrating the rec­
tum. He was brought to the Parkview
hospital as soon as possible, his injur­
ies treated and an operation was per­
formed by Dr. DePuy this afternoon.
His condition was considered serious
and he bled profusely. His father lives
in Marian, Wis: Young Konkel, altho
a stranger at the Bouch farm, was
liked and much sympathy was ex­
pressed for him.
VELVA WOMAN CRUSHED
TO DEATH BY WAGON
Mrs..F. C. Wills, wife of the tenant
on the#John Molitor farm south of
Velva, was crushed to death in an ef­
fort to stop a runaway team, the
wheels of the wagon passing over her
body. She was in her thirty-sixth
year and is survived by her husband
and five children.

Legislative Machinery for Putting the
Initiative Into Effect Not Provided
Under Present Law Says Court
Bismarck, N. D., Sept. 12~The state
supreme court today handed down an
opinion permanently restraining Sec­
retary of State Thomas Hall from put­
ting the capitol removal on the ballot
with other issues to be voted upon in
November, the court holding that the
legislature has not provided the ma­
chinery by which the initiative feature
of the state constitution may be car­
ried out.
The opinion is written by Justice
Goss, all of the members concurring.
Judges Burke, Bruce and Christianson
also filing separate concurring opin­
ions.
The attorneys for the petitioners
were: Miller, Zuger and Tillotson,
Newton, Dullman and Young and Ben­
ton Baker of Bismarck and Sullivan &
Sullivan of Mandan. The attorneys
for the respondents were Lawrence &
Murphy of Fargo, T. F. McCue of Car
rington, J. J. Youngblood of Fessen
den, Rinker & Duell, W. M. Jackson,
J. S. Cameron, J. A. Manley, R. J.
Bothe and C. J. Maddox of New Rock­
ford.
Opinion Quoted
"Our constitutional provisions wero
taken from the Oregon constitution,"
declares the opinion. "The omission
of the words that would have made
this provision self executing and then
so interpreted there by court decision
thereon, must be presumed to have
been deliberate and intentional and for
the purpose of preventing such from
being construed as self executing.
Petition Held Void
"As there is no law authorizing any
amendment of our state constitution
by initiative proceednigs, the petition
is void upon which the respondent
threatens to submit this question to a
vote.
"A court should enjoin submission
of such a question where there is no
law under which it could be legally
submitted to a vote.
"It contemplates that 'legislation
shall be enacted declaring the percent­
age of signers actually necessary to
propose constitutional amendments,
as the words 'Of at least twenty-five
per cent,' were intended to be but a
limitation upon the legislature that
at least 25 per cent should be required,
but not to declare the percentage, leav­!
ing that to future legislative action to
-v.

igwr wguffflif 'wwiffiyw^ '"•"'"lyty.
determine the proper and necessary
minimum percentage to be required,
whether that percentage be twenty
five per cent or more than twenty-five
per cent.
Points Necessity
"It is strongly indicative of neces­
sity for future legislation that no defi­
nite rule for computation of any req­
uisite percentage of signers is declared
under such, while under the constitu­
tional provision as to the initiative of
legislation, the basis is there prescrib­
ed as 'the whole number of votes cast
for the secretary of state at the regu­
lar election last preceding the filing of
the petition.'
Ends Present Fight
This decision on the part of the su­
preme court appears to end for the
time being the capital fight which has
been waged by Bismarck and New
Rockford during the last year or
more.
The general opinion around Bis­
marck is that the only method for the
New Rockford people to pursue
should they desire to continue the
battle is to endeavor to get the neces­
sary "legislative machinery" for the
change passed at the coming session
of the state legislature.
It is possible that petition for a re­
hearing of the case may be made by
the attorneys for New Rockford in the
litigation.
McCOY ADVERTISING MAN HERE

R. B. Thompson of Denison, la., ar­
rived the first of the week to accept
the position of advertising man, win­
dow trimmer and card writer at the
McCoy Department store.
Mr. Thompson has a wife and two
children and will be permanently lo­
cated in this city. He comes with the
very best of recommendations, having

W. R. Bond Suggests Packing Plant
for Minot.
Walter R. Bond, who had charge of
the sale of the Equity Packing House
stock at the Midwinter Fair last win­
ter, suggests that a meeting of all
subscribers be called to meet with
others interested looking to the build­
ing of a packing house in Minot. Now
that the Equity committee has de­
cided not to locate its plant at this
point, a co-operative concern consist
ing of farmers, stock raisers and bus­
iness men can be formed to build,
equip and operate the best packing
plant in the state, it being a well es­
tablished fact that our city is so situ­
ated as to have advantages over every
other in the way of buying and distri­
bution.
HANSBOROUGH WILL
VOTE FOR PRESIDENT
New York, Sept. 12.—H. C. Hans
borough of North Dakota, who served
18 years in the United States senate
as a republican, announced Tuesday
that he intends to support President
Wilson for re-election.
"I am going to support the president
as a Wilson republican," the ex-senat­
or told National Chairman Vance C.
McCormick.
Hansborough said that he was en
route to his home at Devils Lake and
intended to enter the campaign active­
ly in behalf of the democratic national
ticket.
REPUBLICANS WIN IN MAINE.
Portland, Me., Sept. 11.—Maine re­
publicans reinforced by returning pro­
gressives, won a signal victory at the
election today. They elected a gov­
ernor, an auditor, two U. S. senators
and four representatives in congress
and, wresting control of the statu
house of representatives from the
democrats, will be able on a joint vote
of the legislature to elect the other
state officers not chosen by popular
vote.
Carl E. Mliliken led his ticket, de
feating Oakley C. Curtis, who sought
reelection, by a plurality of approx­
imately 13,000.
Four Veal Calves Bring $132.20
J. F. St. John of Surrey established
the record today when he brought four
May veal calves to the city, disposing
of them to the Valley meat market for
$132.20. The four calves weighed
1655 pounds and they sold for 8 cents
a pound. Mr. Hannaford states that
this is the highest price he has ever
paid for a like number of calves. They
were of the Shorthorn strain and were
dandies. Mr. St. John will bring in
three more like them this week.
Road Louse Locks Horns
with Large Studebaker
The large Studebaker delivery car
of the Valet Tailoring company was
run into by a Ford car driven by Earl
Walker of Sawyer at the corner of the
street leading from East Central ave­
nue to Eastwood park yesterday after­
noon. The collision damaged the de­
livery car to the extent of probably
$100, while the little old Ford escaped
unharmed. It is expected that con­
siderable litigation will result from
the accident as there seems to be some
question as to whom the blame can be
rightfully placed upon. The Stude
bak was being driven by the propriet­
or, Christ Demopoulos, while the Ford
car contained two men besides the
driver.
We were informed later that the
parties compromised their grievances
by the owner of the Ford car paying
Mr. Demopoulos $80 for the damages
inflicted on his car.

Editor Independent:
I have almost completed my trip
through the land of magnificent scen­
ery, where their harvest, like ours, is
a golden one, but is copper and gold,
instead of wheat.
The scenery is past description. It
grips you and holds you, the snow-cap­
ped mountains whose great peaks ex­
tend up 14,000 to 20,000 feet in the
air, the huge glaciers moving on their
slow journey to the sea, the icebergs
floating in the ocean, the long green
and white ghost streamers, the north­
ern lights playing fantastically across
the sky, the mountain falls—this is
Alaska, but just a glimpse, for you
must see it to understand it.
There are a great number of quaint
Indian villages with their wierd totem
poles and odd carvings. Their bas­
kets woven from the sea grass show
the true primitive condition of the
native Alaska.
Alaska is the home of the halibut
industry and has large numbers of
salmon canneries. Their cold storage
and freezing plants are as well equip­
ped as any on the Pacific coast.
The gold industry is located on the
Gastinean channel. I visited the
Treadwell mine, the second largest
gold producing mine in the world.
Here is found the historical "Glory
Hale" where so many men lost their
lives.
At Thane across the bay is the Alas­
ka Gastinean Mining Co. They have
the largest mill in the world, with a
capacity of 10,000 tons of gold ore
each day. The plant has thousands of
stamps which grind the ore into con­
centrates.
It would perhaps surprise you to
know that the present coal fields are
as extensive as the entire state of
Pennsylvania, but as yet are largely
undeveloped. There are two main
fields of this. The Matunaska and the
Bering River c?al fields. At Katalla
the gateway of the Bering fields I
found two large, active mines. The
McDonald mine, which mines bitumin­
ous coal, is at a decided disadvantage
because of the fact that they have no
way of getting their coal out. The
other company is the Alaska Petrol­
eum and Coal Co. They have a prop­
erty embracing several millions of
tons of some of the highest grade an­
thracite coal to be found in the world.
They have completed now 14 miles of
a 17-mile railway which connects with
bunkers to be built at Controller Bay.
They are mining now and have a force
of men at work on their property.
They also are owners cf vsl'iable oil
claims. The oil claims show wonder­
ful prospects. The oil zr.?" be seen
seeping out all over the entire prop­
erty.
The Alaska Anthracite Railroad Co.
are completing their line here now and
have a big crew of men at work.
Th-j pnyorniifit -ire pro­
gressing slowly but surely. Autos are
unknown practically here and the
judge of Katalla spoke hoastingly
when he told men that there were
three horses in the town. Boats fur­
nish the method of transportation and
before one goes out he must have his
rubber boots.
This country is a paradise to the
hunter. There are many bear and
mountain goats. The geese go in
droves instead of flocks. A man often
goes out and kills ten or twelve geese
in three hours.
I will write you more later.
Sincerely yours,
HOWARD HUSTON.
HANS FOR DES LACS
NEW SCHOOL BUILDING
$18,000 Two Story Brick Building to be
Erected at Once to Replace
One That Was Burned
R. B. Stacy-Judd. one of Minot's
architects, has been awarded the con­
tract to furnish plans and specifica­
tions for the new school building at
Des Lacs to replace the one destroyed
by fire recently. The building will be
constructed just as quickly as possible
in order that the school work can go
on without more interruption than
necessary.
The new structure will be a beauti­
ful six-room building with full base­
ment. It will have a three-color de­
sign of brick work with hollow tile
backing and will be two stories high.
It will be equipped with a modern
heating plant and ventilating system
and will be thoroughly up-to-date. It
is estimated that the build inn- will cost
in the neighborhood of $18,000 and it
will be a much better structure than
the old four-room brick veneered build­
ing which was burned.
Pair Arrested at Hotel
Mrs. J. Almun was arrested at the
Lexington hotel Tuesday night, charg­
ed with resorting to a room for im­
moral purposes. She was fined $50.
Her male escort, said to be a Soo bag­
gageman, was fine $25.
