Rev. Bradfield Resigns.
It is with the greatest regret that the
members aud adherents of the First
l'resbvteriau Church of Yale, aud the
community at large, learn of the resig
nation of Rev. E. il. uradtieid from the
pulpit of the I'resbyteriau church and
the removal of himself aud family from

of missionary at large in this 1'resby
tery Bomewhat over two years ago to
be pastor of the church here and he
goes back to the 6ame vork, locating
In Lapeer.
Ills resignation takes effect Septem
ber 30, but in order to place his child
ren in school the family and household
goods are already being settled in the

Mr. Uradtieid is a Etrong man in ev
ery way, his work here has been good,
lie is a deep, clear thinker and reason
er, broad minded and earnest. His
chosen work tills him with enthusiasm
and devotion.
He aud his will be followed with the
best wishes of the whole community.
Additional Local
Work of County Agriculturist
The work done in connection with
formation of the co-operative hay
growers marketing organization at
Capac, September 5th, outranked every
thing else in importance during the
week. At different times the past
weeks, considerable effort has been put
forth to create an interest in the project
and the fact that over one hundred bay
growers atteuded the meeting is very
good proof that the leaders in the var
ious localities did their work well in
creating a etrong eentiment m favor of
organization. The Michigan Director
of Markets, J. X. McRride, was secured
to assist In the formation of the asso
ciation and gave an excellent talk on
Co-operative Marketing," explaining
its principles and objects and instruct
ing the meeting how to organize in ac
cordance with state and national laws.
The practical questions asked Mr. Mc
Rride showed that the men were in
earnest and determined not only to lis
ten, but to act as well. This was fur
ther shown by the fact that a large
number of the most prominent hay
growers present paid their dues and
enrolled as members and elected otli
cers. The officers aud directors were
authorized to draft a constitution aud
by laws, make an investigation to de
termine the amount of capital neces
sary, and call another meeting of the
membership at an early date. Kach
member, too, is circulating a paper for
securing additional members, and it is
believed that little trouble will be ex
perienced In trebling the original mem
bership. Thursday was spent at the State
Fair, where a stadv was made of trac
tors, milking machines, sprayers, and
other farm machinery. The hortlcul
tural buildings and the 6tock barns
also claimed considerable attention and
agricultural matters pertaining to St.
Clair county were discussed with rep
resentatives of the Farm Crops Depart
ment of the M. A, C who had charge
of an exhilit in the agricultural
building.
Friday afternoon was spent investi
gating swine sickness in Grant town
ship. No symptoms of hog cholera or
other contagious disease, however, were
found to be present, the trouble prob
ably being caused by some detlciency
in the ration. If every stockman will
be as prompt as this man was in re
porting anv sickness among his bogs,
we should have very little difficulty in
preventing hog cholera from getting a
start in our county. The Michigan
laws make It the duty of the County
Agriculturist to act as livestock agent
as well, ana me liivesiocs sauuary
Commission furnishes him with a
spraying outtlt and material for the
disinfection of premises where hog
cholera has existed. Furthermore, the
Rureau of Animal industry at Wash
ington has placed two veterinaries in
the state, one of whom will be avail
able should an investigation oi swine
diseases become necessary. All of this
is done without any charge to the own
er of the stock.
The meeting held at the office Satur
day afternoon for the purpose of dli
cuBstne the feed question for the com
lust fall and winter, while not largely
attended, was well worth while, jnd
those who attended gained a better un
derstanding of their needs along this
line.

Would-Be -Fishermen.
If there is anything more tautalizing
to a would be hsherman promising his
friends a peek at a dandy string of fish
as he starts off on a fishing trip, and
then to come home empty handed, we
would like to know what it is. We've
been there ourselves and we know just
how the two gentlemen felt who plan
ned and prepared with great careful
ness and pleutitude of bait and grub
for whole, long, perfect day of en
snaring the tinny tribe. Last Thursday
it was the aforesaid parties headed tor
U ack river with smiling faces and "lust
wait 'til we get back" expressions.
They Ashed up and down stream for
several miles each way, until the barren
prospect became tiresome and then,
with the bright idea that an toe nsn
had moved into Lake Huron they start
ed off with renewed faith and. hope.
But the waters of the lake were also
barren, not one lone fish came to their
insistent call. When night fell Dolnh
and Milt sueaked away home and en-
tered the rear door. ,
Tantalizing! It was monstrous mean.
Their friends have beeu very good
Indeed in keeping the sad affair aulet

news, and this was a good one.
A Fine Bred Hore.
Arthur Dillard, the pacing stallion
owued by A. . Kelly of this city, won
first money in the 2:21 pace at Bad Axe
last Ihursday. it was a seven neat
race, nine horses being entered for the
honors. Three other horses took heats
besides Arthur Dillard. Mr. Kelly has
just reason to be proud of this linely
bred horse, for it certainly shows the
best of breeding when he comes back
stronger and better each succeeding
beat and finally picks oil the plum.
The last half of the hnai heat, wnicn
gave Arthur Dillard tirst money in the
race, was paced in without1 a
skip. Dave Henderson, who is a train
er of considerable repute and experi
ence, drove the winner In this race.
