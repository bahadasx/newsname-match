Got Wrong. Babies
From the Hospital
Mothers Took Doctor's Word That
Hair Had Changed.
O. K. Now.
KEW YORK. Bent. H.-Mra. Dor Del
Plana and Mrs. Anna Constantlne didn't
know each other yesterday morning, In
spite of tho fact that both live In the
comparatively small Jersey town of
North Bergen, but they ive very good
friends today. And they are both happy,
Mrs. Del Plana hugging her light-hatred
little Richard, and Mrs. Constantlne
with her dark-haired Samuel.
Perhaps ther would never have been
any trouble If Klchard and Samuel, each
two. years old, hadn't been attacked by
Infantile paralysis and taken to the
hospital for contagious diseases at
Laurel Hills.
It was Just a week ago that Mrs.
Constantlne was notified her son was to
be discharged from the hospital. When
she called for him that day she Insisted
some mistake had been made, but the
authorities brushed aside her protests
and told her that the boy was really
her own Sammy.
Much the same scene was enacted the
next day when Mrs. Del Plana appeared
to claim her Richard. His features had
changed, and his hair had unaccount
ably got darker.
'But It all came out right yesterday.
Mrs. P. Schwartz was visiting Mrs. Del
Plana. "That Isn't your son, said Mrs.
Mchwarts. "He looks like Mrs. Con-
stantine's."
Mrs. Del Plana didn't know anything
about Mrs. Constantino's Richard, but
Mrs. Schwartz hurried over to the other
woman's home and In a few moments
Mrs. Constantlne came back with her.
Then a wonderful thing occurred. When
the baby that Mrs. Del Pli hadeen
Persuaded was hers saw Mrs, Conatan
Ine, he put out. his hands and called
"Mammy!" Sammy remembered. Of
course the women hugged and kissed
each other and their babies their own
babies this time.

Max C. Baum Files Suit Against
Steamboat Man and Former
loe King.
DEFENDANT DENIES DEBT
Declares He Never Agreed to
Pay the Plaintiff Any Money
for Services.
-u
NEW YORK. Sept. 14.-Max C. Baum
has brought suit against Charles W.
Morse, the steamboat man, for 1100,000
In payment for his alleged service In
persuading President Taft to free Morse
from the Federal prison at Atlanta, In
11Z.
The suit, which was filed about six
months ago, came to light throjgh an
order signed In the supreme court by
Justice Guy permitting the filing of
papers In the case. Mr. Morse was con
victed In 1909 of violating the banking
laws.
Ilaum described himself as a real es
tate and Insurance agent, and was said
to have had more or leas experience In
getting evidence In divorce cases and
other litigation.
Morse Denies Any Debt.
Morse said that he didn't owe Daum
any money and didn't Intend to pay him
any.
"Whatever Ilaum did for me," said
Morse, "he told me he was doing be
cause he wished to see me get Justice.
I think about all he did was to have
some pieces put In the newspapers. I
sever agreed to pay him any money."
Morse scoffed at the assertion of Baum
that It was he who obtained Morse's re
lease by President Taft.
"Baum figures I have some money and
he wants some of It. That's all there la
to the case." Morse concluded.
Mrs. 'Clementine Morse Is named as a
defendant In the suit also because, as
Baum alleges, he was retained by her,
but efforts which a half dozen process
servers, have bean making to serve hen
since last 'fall have thus far been fruit
less. George W. Files, attorney for
Baum. said yesterday that It took his
men three months to serve Morse. Ken
neth K. Mackenzie attorney for Morse,
hsa filed an appearance In the case and
has demanded a bill of particulars,
which Is now being prepared.
Says Wife Appealed to Him.
Baum alleges that Mrs. Morse appealed
to him to aid her husband soon after
he had been convicted, and that he at
once started collecting evidence on which
to base a plea for a new trial.
Baum contends In detail that after
Morse wss sent to prison he (Baum)
solicited the aid of members of a frater
nal order to which Morse belonged and
by using other methods he enllated the
sympathy of Mr. Taft. Ha says that
while he was making these efforts Morse
told him that If he was successful he
would be msde "wealthy beyond his
wildest dreams." Yet, after Morse was
releaaed, the latter sent him a bouquet
of rosea.

FAVORED AS SECOND CHOICE
Business Men Indicate Desire
to Push. Local Claims First,
Then Virginia City's.
A movement to unite Washington and
Alexandria In a campaign to bring the
$11,000,000 Government armor plato plant
to Alexandria was set on foot by Con
gressman Carlln and others today.
Washington had Its hearing before Sec
retary of the Navy Daniels and the
naval board yesterday. Congressman
Carlln waa at the Navy Department to
day to flx a time when Alexandria may
preaent Ita claims for the armor plant.
An effort wilt be made by Alexandria
booatera to Induce Washington hpostera
to aubmlt a Joint brief with Alexandria
favoring the latter city.
Thomas Grant, secretary of the Wash
ington Chamber of Commerce, explained
at hla office today that while the busi
ness men of thla city were unwilling to
abandon their light to have the armor
plant located here, they naturally looked
with favor on Alexandria aa a second
choice.
In Fight "to Last Dllch."
P. T. Moran, president of the Wash
ington Chamber of Commerce, appeared
today before the board to refute some
of the arguments made by the repre
sentative of other cities against Wash
ington. ,
"Washington." he asld, 'Is In the
last ditch. If then we see that we
haven't rot a chance and we think now
she has every chance we would got
behind Alexandria"
Secretary Daniels today heard repre
sentatives rrom Chattanooga and Eliza
bethan, Tenn., and Buena .Vlata and
Petersburg, Va. When the board re
cessed ati 1 o'clock no time had been
fixed for hearing Alexandria.
v( Carlln Outlines Argument.
In outlining the arguments he will
make aa spokesman for Alexandria
when he appears before the hoard. Con
gressman Carlln today said:
"Alexandria has the advantage of
deep water to the sea and a deep water
harbor. We havo seven railroads. We
are situated at the center of plglron dis
tribution. Pig Iron can bo brought In
from the South or from South American
republics as well as from Pennsylvania.
This gives us a competitive pig Iron
market and relieves Alexandria from
tho dependency on a single source of pig
Iron supply that would lie against any
location In the Iron district.
"There Is an Ideal labor situation In
Alexandria. There Is the entire agri
cultural section of Maryland and Vir
ginia to draw labor from.
"Llmo and manganese, which enter In
to the manufacture of armor plate, can
be laid down in Alexandria cheaper
than at any point competing with us.
Coal can be laid Jown cheaper In Alex
andria than In any competing city.
Meets Safety Requirements.
"On the point of safety Alexandria
meets all the requirements. The Poto
mac could easily be mined against naval
attack so as to make Alexandria Im
pregnable. Alexandria could not be
taken unless the Capital were Invaded.
"Alexandria as a site for the armor
nl
lant presents the advantage or be-
fng- under the Immediate supervision
of the department oi wasningion.
great advantage conilderlng that this
is a virgin field the Navy Department
la entering. This would be a big
help to the Government not only from
the clerical standpoint, but from a
practical standpoint.
"The Government already owns
property at Alexandria suitable for a
site so that there would be no ex
pense from this quarter. The Gov
ernment has Just won a suit giving It
title to forty acres of land on the
Alexandria deep water rlyer front.
Only twenty-acres Is required for the
plant"
A brief will be filed by the Alexandria
committee later. The hearing of Alex
nndrla's claims may be potponed. It was
indicated touay, since ine commiuee
which will present Its arguments Is
readily available to be called before the
Navy Department at any time.
Charles Hall Davis, of Petersburg,
presented an argument showing the
strategic and Industrial Importance of
the Chesapeake Bay region as a site for
the armor factory.

ARMOR PLANT FACTORS

Tho law says tho plant must bo located
in time of war."
The following big factors must be considered In deciding on a location:
Cost of land for site; availability of raw material, and condition of
labor market.
Transportation facilities, with tho matter of bridges to bo crossed or
tunnels on the lines to shipbuilding plants, is a factor of first Im
portance. An Idea of the payroll for higher salaried officials was give when a
comparative schedule of one of Pennsylvania's three armor plate
factories was given. This Includes:
General superintendent, $16,000; open hearth superintendent, $6,000;
forging plant superintendent, $5,000; machine shop superintendent,
$4,000; chief engineer, $4,000; metallurgist, $6,000; chemist, $2,600.
Members of tho general board said today It may bo a matter of three

EXPERTS MEET TO
STUDY MILK COST
Committeeman Says Effort Will
Not Be to Increase Price
to Consumer.
First steps In the investigation which
may result In an Increase In the price
of milk In tho District of Columbia are
to be taken today by the meeting of
the experts of the Department of Agri
culture with representatives of the
Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers'
'Association.
The meeting has been called for 1
o'clock this afternoon. Westmoreland
Davis, president of the producers' as
aoclatlon, will preside, and W. J. Spill
man, B. H. Rawle. and Frank O. Caf
fey, of the Department of Agriculture,
will give their vlewa, based on Investi
gations Wads' in the division' of farm
management,, the .dairy, and the so
licitor's office.
"The milk producers who supply
Washington have no Intention of trying
to Increase the price of milk to the
consumer In the- District." said one of
the members of the committee today In
discussing the meeting. "On the con
trary they feel that the case of the
consumers and their own Is In much the
same condition. The Increasing restric
tions of a legal character make dairy
farming expensive.
"These restrictions have Increased es
pecially in this section of the country.
Tho enforcement of the tuberculin test
hss made our dary herds extremely ex
pensive through the killing out of In
fective cows. We are not complaining
of all necessary and Just health meas
ures. But the application of the tuber
culin test has discovered cows we did
not auapect and has required extraor
dinary renewals In the herds beyond
the average depreciation considered In
our cost figures. '
"We want to know why we are paid
21 cents for the same gallon of milk the
consumer pays 36 cents. Fifteen cents
per gallon for distribution of the milk
strikes us as a high figure."
ine meeting will be held at the Mun-
sey building.
