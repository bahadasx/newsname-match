Today, the fourth day of the Big
Free Fair surpasses by far any pre
vious day at Topeka f'.rs for years.
Fully 55,000 people were on tlu
grounds at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
The grandstand and bleachers were
Jammed at the races and standing
room was at a premium. r,vtry hhuh,
every concessicn and every exhibit was
packed to capacity.
By 10 o'clock this morning Kansas
ox-fin. was lined with people pouring
i, ' the city from special and regular
trains which were filled to overflow
ing. Automobiles lined, the streets on
their way to the fair grounds. Street
cars and trailers from early in the
morning were filled both coming and
going to the grounds. Every available
car had been pressed Into service by
the street railway company at noon.
Big Crowd Before Noon.
By 11 o'clock the crowd on the
grounds rivalled the mid-afternoon
crowd of Wednesday. The dozens of
eating houses were filled before noon,
and the Industrious barkers in front
of the professional eating booths
transformed themselves into waiters.
Facilities for waiting on the trade
were needed then much more than
shouts for business. One enterprising
church has erected a cafeteria in con
nection with an eating booth. A line
which stretched five feet across the
cinder walk stood in front of the cafe
teria at noon waiting turns to grab
something to eat before continuing
with the continuous rounds of ex
hibits., shows and concessions.
Trouble in Exhibiting.
Even In the morning one had diffi
culty in pushing his way through the
horse, cattle, swine and poultry barns,
agricultural hall and fine arts build
ing In desperation. Dr. C. W. Mc
t'ampbell had the exhibitors take their
horses to the race track for Judging.
Judges in front of the cattle barns
elbowed their way through the hun
dreds who crowded near. A football
player was the only one who could
have any luck in making speed in the
poultry barn.
Automobiles driven in by thousands
of townspeople and farmers, taking
advantage of the good roads, lined the
space on the west side of the grounds
wired off for machines. By 11 o'clock
there was an overflow. Automobiles
lined every inch of available space on
the sides of the west roads and only
the constant insistence of guards kept
owners from parking their cars right
up against the grandstand. It would
be worth one's while to see them get
ting out of the grounds about 10
o'clock tonight.
For once the weather man seems to
be on friendly terms with the man
agement of the fair. Yet, he is hav
ing no end of fun teasing the people

of Shawnee county and Topeka, who
are staging the only Free Fair in the
world. The day opened, dark and
gloomy and chilly. Everyone groaned
when he awoke this morning and bade
adieu to the hopes of yesterday that
Topeka was to have the best fair in
her history.
Then, the Sun.
The weather man didn't taunt To
peka long, however. About 9 o'clock
without any warning he rolled away
the chill clouds and the sun again
stepped forth, brilliant and radiant,
warming the hearts of visitors and
putting "pep into the show, race
track and concession men at the fair.
The crowd was good natured and
the necessary impediment in traffic
didn't seem to jar on the nerves.
"It is the most orderly crowd we
have ever had on the grounds," said
Phil Eastman, secretary, today. "Traf
fic conditions are bad this year, yet we
haven't had a bit of trouble and I wish
to thank the thousands for their good
nature and co-operation in rr king
such a successful fair possible."

Poultry judging is completed. Char

BIG RACE CROWD
Standing Room Only at Free
Fair Track Today.
Events Start on Fastest Track
of the Week.
Twenty minutes before the races
started this afternoon standing room
in the grandstand was selling at 25
cents per person. The big grandstand
was paced from top to bottom and
when the races started there was no
standing room left. Outside, the
crowd was lined up in front of the
gate for half a Mock.
Today is easily the big dav of the
fair so far. There are molt out of
town people on the grounds than on
any previous day and the Topeka turn
out is about the same as on "Topeka
day."
The track is fast in better condi
tion than on any previous day, accord
ing to O. M. Keats, superintendent of
the races. He is expecting some rec
ord heats today or tomorow. There
was a sprinkle of rain just after the
races started, but not enough to
scare anyone and two minutes later
the sun was shining.
Before the races started Miss Loula
Long of Kansas City and Mrs. O. G.
Moers of Columbia. Mo., gave an ex
hibition in front of the grandstand.
Each drove a "ladies' pair." The blue
ribbon went to Miss Long and the erd

BAMBRICK TO DIE TOMORROW
Bnt Evidence Piles Up to Prove
He's ot Guilty.
Confession Clears Mrs. Xiohol's
Servant, Sentenced to Die.
Xew York, Sept. 14. With the con
fession of Joseph Mulholland of the
part he and three other men played
in the murder of Mrs. Elizabeth Nich
ols, aged wealthy widow, a year ago,
another chapter was added to New
York's most remarkable record of
convictions in which every effort is
now being made to show that inno
cent men were sentenced to death or
life imprisonment.
The confessions of Mulholland and
Arthur "Waltonen, arrested in Iron
wood, Mich., absolve Onnie Tallas
from actual part in the murder of Mrs.
Nichols. But Tallas, a mere youth, is
now in Sing Sing, sentenced to life im
prisonment. Two other cases which have attract
ed wide attention are those of Charles
F. Stielow, convicted of the murder of
Charles B. Phelps and the latter's
housekeeper, and Thomas Bambrick,
sentenced to death for the alleged
murder of Policeman George Dapping
here. Steilow has been snatched from
the death chair repeatedly and an
other man was finally found who con
fessed to the murders, tho he later
repudiated his statement
May Ask Xew Reprieve,
Bambrick is sentenced to die tomor
row morning. He was saved at the
last moment only a few weeks ago by
a court order. Owing to the discovery
of new evidence District Attorney
Swann intimated today he might ask
for another reprieve for Bambrick.
Affidavits have been received indicat
ing that Bambrick may be innocent.
Frank Meehan, now in Sing Sing, has
sworn that he saw Dapping killed and
that a tail -maon -shot: hici. - VUucn brick
measures only five feet five inches,
and when taken before Meehan, the
latter swore positively he was not the
man who killed Dapping.
Fifty affidavits were filed at Al
bion, N. Y., yesterday, intended to
show that Stielow is not guilty of the
murders for which he is sentenced to
die. Stielow s confession is declared
to have been dragged from him by
third degree methods and two Sing
Sing doctors stated in their affidavits
that he is sufpectible to influence of
stronger characters, and under threats,
would likely say whatever was sug
gested to him.
Woman Died From Fright.
The confessions of Mulholland and
Waltonen are regarded by the police
as completely clearing up the Nichols
case, which has always retained an
element of mystery. A third man im
plicated is still at large. Mulholland
and Waltonen told how they tried to
get Tallas to kill the wealthy widow
but he was afraid. They then over
powered and bound him and rushed
to Mrs. Nichols room. On seeing them,
she fell back dead of heart failure.
The men who had frightened her to
death escaped with jewelry valued nt
about $16,000. Tallas was arrested,
tried and convicted of murder.
INDIANS SUE FOR LAND
Pottawatomies Will Claim Entire
Water Front of Chicago.
Mayetta, Kan., St.pt. 14. The Pot
tawatomie Indians soon 'will Institute
legal proceedings thru an attorney
from Chicago who has assured them
their claim is legal, to gain possession
of the entire lake front of Chicago
from Michigan avenue to the edge of
Lake Michigan. Announcement that
the necessary suits would be filed were
made here today following a meeting
of the tribal council here yesterday
with the attorney who brought the
proposal before them.
The proceedings will be based, ac
cording to the announcement, on the
fact that a hundred years ago the
Pottawatomies lived on the site of the
city. The site was ceded to the gov
ernment but since that time an island,
then in Lake Michigan has been con
nected with the mainland and that
accretions have been made along the
entire lake front. It is this property
the Indians claim and is said to in
clude Grant park.
The Pottawatomies agreed to permit
the Chicago attorney to institute the
suit in their name after he proposed
it to them yesterday. The pow-wow
of the council was attended by the at
torney. Superintendent Snyder of the
Indian agency, and the Indians them
selves. For hours the subject was de
bated and the decision finally was
i made that the Indians would not stand
the expense of the suit but will allow
the Chicago man to handle it on a
contingent basis.

L. S. Clayton, Druggist at 1019
East Sixth, Disappears.
Wife in Tears Has Only Belief
That He Is Aliye.
I S. Clayton, proprietor of the drug
store at 1019 East Sixth street, has
disappeared and his wife and father
have asked the sheriff and county at
torney to try to locate him. Clayton
lived at 114 West Eleventh street.
Last Saturday night Clayton locked
up the drug store and turning to a
bunch of young fellows around the
store, remarked :
"Well, boys, I'll see you Monday."
That is the last trace county officers
have been able to find of the missing
druggist. Clayton's father called on
the county attorney today with the be
lief that his son is dead. He insisted
that he is dead and' that his body
would be found at 114 West Eleventh
street if the officers would take the
trouble to make a search.
Visited Ills Wife.
L. L. Kiene, sheriff, W. E. Atchison,
county attorney, and Robert Garver,
assistant county attorney, visited the
Clayton home today and talked with
the missing man's wife. She began to
cry as soon as they entered the hou;ie,
but after a time told what she knew.
She assured the officers that so far
as she knew Clayton is not dead and
gave them all the chance in the world
to prove to themselves that the body
is not concealed about the house. The
officers have given up that theory en
tirely. Mrs. Clayton expressed the opinion
that her husband has become dement
ed. Officers do not believe that either.
After leaving the Clayton home they
drove to the Bank of Topeka where
Clayton kept his funds and found that
on September 9, the day he disappear
ed, he drew a check for $300. One
small check has come in since then
but it may have been drawn earlier.
It throws no light upon the direction
taken by Clayton when he left.
County officials believe Clayton sim
ply drew $300 out of the bank and
skipped. Efforts will be made to lo
late him.
Mrs. Clayton instructed Sheriff
Kienc this afternoon to offer a reward
of $100 in her name for information
leading to the whereabouts of Clayton.
Cards will be printed and distributed
carrying a photograph and a descrip
tion of the missing druggist.

several thousand strikers paraded
thru the streets here today seeking
support in their fight for the existenco
of their organization.
Headed by a band furnished by the
Musicians' union, the strikers marched
from Klghty-sixth street and Park

meeting was held this afternoon. :
About 3,000 of the strikers were in
uniform. Police placed the number !
in Jine at 7,000, but union officals de
clared there were more than 10,000.
Today market the opening of the

panies have now joined in the refusal
to accept the recommendation of the
public service commission for arbi

of a general strike in support

Lawrence, Kan., Sept. 14. Th
tariff will be the principal issue by
which the Republicans will carry the
west, in the opinion of - Charles W.
Fairbanks, Republican nominee for
vice president, who spoke here today.
Mr. Fairbanks, while he talks on the
Mexican situation and other Interna
tional affairs, lays the greatest stress
on the tariff.
In an interview today Mr. Fairbanks
said he believed the Maine electlr n
was indicative of the results at the
election in November. The nominee
was in Maine during the campaign
and election. "The results there,"
said Mr. Fairbanks, "were most gratl
Ing to all party leaders." A national
victory for the G. O. P. was predictetf
by him.
While in Kansas, probably at Kan

talk on the recent strike crisis and

however, is the tariff.

willing to stand for the great policies
which mean prosperity in the fields,
prosperity upon the farm,' prosperity
in the village and prosperity every

next president of the United States is
Charles Evans Hughes, of New York,

is a matter of Importance to each and
all of us that we should send to
Washington as chief executive of the
republic one of the best men our
country has ever produced. A few
years ago we sent to Washington Mr.
Wilson as president. Mr. Wilson
tackled the job and got into trouble
the very first crack out of the box;
and he has had nothing but trouble
from that hour to this. Mr. Charles
Evans Hughes has the support of that

U.S.OIexican Conference Takes
Fp Tax Problems.
Discuss Withdrawal of Troops
From Mexican Soil.
New London, Conn., Sept. 14.
Steps to relieve any unfair burdens
in Mexican taxation of foreign -owned
property appeared likely to result
from the conference today between
American and Mexican commission
ers here. At the same time the com
missioners drew nearer to a concrete
proposition for withdrawing Ameri
can forces from Mexico and patroll
ing the boundary.
During the morning today the Joint
commission discussed taxes. The
Mexicans said frankly there is no In
tent to place a premium on enterprise,
and the American commissioners
agreed there is an effort to encourage
development of revenues for the gov
ernment while at the same time pro
moting industrial growth.
Oeneral Bliss counseled the Ameri
can commissioners this afternoon on
withdrawal and border patrol ques
tions. From his suggestions, a plan
for withdrawal of the troops in the
near future and rearranging the
border patrol will undoubtedly de
velop. ROAD BOOSTTrTMEET
