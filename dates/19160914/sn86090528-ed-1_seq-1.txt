Some Displays of Especial Interest from
Point of Numbers and Excellence;
Saby Show Called Off
With a good early attendance and
with exhibits of marked merit, the
second free Grady Count' fair wa.s
opened this morning under the best
auspices, Clear skies induced exhib
itors to rush their displays' to the
grounds and as a result more depart
ments were In running order than is
usually the case at the dawn of the
initial day.
AVhile all sections of the ground 3
make creditable showings this year
especial interest Is attached to the
abundant entries wflieh have been
made in "the fine stock department.
The horse stalls are completely filled
and additions are being erected to ac
commodate tardy entrants for county
honors. The cows, hogs and poultry
make splendid showings and those
who have entered into competition for
the best corn products have excelled
themselves and have furnished one of
the strongest points at this year's
show. In the poultry division the tent
will I'kely be fillc-c to its capacity to
night and judging from the unusual
exhibits already brought in this' divis
ion will exi eed all previous efforts.
The educational and other parts of the
textile department were unusually
prompt in the arrangement of their
various booths.
Every allotment of space in the mer
chants tent was taken yesterday and
provisions made for additional dis
plays elsewhere.
Baby Show Called Off.
Everything bids fair to be a success
except the better baby show which
was eliminated from the attractions
this morning when the ladies in
charge, Mrs. C. E. Schow and Mrs.
Bert Harris, were informed that ow
ing to the disposition of local physi
cians to take no part in it the infant
show was called off. This proved to
be a disappointment to about fifteen
mothers who were on the ground early
with their infant prospects and the
many more who followed during the
day.
Merchants' Exhibits.
On entering the merchants' tent one
is welcomed at the booth designed t"
advertise New: State coffee, and cups
of the steaming beverage with pure
cream and sugar to match are offers!

literature on the Dietz auxiliary car
buretor. The Davidson & Case Lumber com
pany, V. N. Adamson manager, fur
nishes a good supply of coal and
paints.
Other booths are being filled this
afternoon.
Agricultural Hall.
The agricultural ball will be one of
the great attractions of the fair, espe
cially to the farmer. The Tuttle town
ship booth, in charge of Mrs. Roy
Sloan, and the Boys and Girls Club
wrok display, in charge of Miss ttfie:
Cooper, were among the first to be
readv for business and challenged the'
interest of the visitors. The adult ag-
ricultural display, on the opposite of U
he boys' and girls 'tables, is in char.; J
pf Secretary Erslaud iu addition to
his other numerous duties.
Much interest attaches to the honey
display of J. D. Lindsay, w here a dem
onstration caso, showing the bees at
work, is always the center of a curious
crowd.
Lnion township has ti creditable
showing this year as has Pocasset.
The Chickasha Star also maintains
a booth in this tent.
Among the private agricultural dis
plays already in is that of J. It. Cast
of Acme, near Rush Springs.
Splendid Textile Showing.
The textile department, of which
Mrs. Ed P. Johns, the superintendent,
is already in personal charge, assisted
! by Mrs. R. A. Lyle. Mrs. J. D. Leon-
aid and Mrs. T. II. Williams, arouses
the keen interest of man, woman and
child, each of whom may find some
thing in this department on which t)
ponder. The display of quilts and
handiwork is especially fine as is the
educational display in charge of Su
perintendent Shepard. The culinary
section, presided over by Mrs. Gilkey,
is one of the most attractive in this
most interesting aggregation of varied
contributions.
Poultry Department.
W. W. Rossington is especially
proud of the quality of entries to the
poultry department over wl'ich he pre
sides. Especially fine are the speci
mens or Plymouth Rocks, Rhode Is
land Reds and bantams which are al
ready on exhibition. All the coops
will be filled by night and all depart
ments are already represented.
Automobile Display.
An interesting feature of the fair is
the automobile exhibit in which werj
i .......
shown four cars by the uverianu
agency, three Studebakers, a Metz
and a Dodge car at noon today with
other entries promised for this after
noon.
Live Stock Plentiful.
Those who are interested in hog
production will find plenty to satisfy
them in this department, which is one
of the best at the fair.
Horses, mules and jacks ot superior
grades are entered to an extent not an
ticipated by fair officials and in num
ber superior to any show ever held in
Chickasha.
Then there are the contributions of
"hot dog" and many other edibles for
the inner man and a goodly number
of side shows to interest b3th children
and adults.
The grounds will be lighted all
night and a watchman will keep vigil
until morning.

Better Than Average Crop Begins to Be
Unloaded in Chickasha a Month
Earlier than Last Year
That the size of the corn crop was
a welcomed surprise to farmers in
Washita valley was the assertion
this morning of J. At. Peters, con
buyer, who has already received many
wagon loads which are being stored
until dry enough for shipment.
"Where farmers figured on between
eighteen and twenty bushels to the
acre they are getting thirty and forty
of better looking corn than they ex
pected was possible thirty days ago."
he said. "While not equal to last
year's crop the yield this year will far
exceed the average as the dry weather
did not have as damaging effect as
was feared a mouth ago. The corn
is coming in much earlier than last
year.''

PROPOSAL TO ISSUE
BONDS IS FAVORED
Dr. Cordon Points to Necessity for Per
manent Construction; Evidence of
Prosperous Community are Seen
"Ninnekah is for good roads and
will do all Him can to get Uiem."-C
M. Lents.
"I am ready to Join with the citi
zens of Grady county iu furtherlm;
the good roads movement iu any wav
I can." -Dr. R. J. Gordon.
"Count me in for gocul roads all tb
time." Dan Stephebs.
"I am for good roads and am ridy
to do all I can."--J. O. Bni.
Such WKre some ot the (tentiment
expressed by citizens of Niitnekah,
who were visited by Ed F. Johns. L.
C. Hutson and a Dally Express man
yesterday afternoon in behalf of the
good roads meeting that is to be held
In- Chickasha Saturday afternoon.
Assurances were received that Nin
nekah will send a good fiized delega
tion to the meeting, including Messrs.
I.ents, Bray Stephens, Dave Boswell,
Dr. Gordon, Dr. Gejrard and others.
Among the numerous business men
and farmers interviewed thene was no
divided opinion as to the iiec-ssity for
better highways in Grady county and
the proposal to vote bonds lu order to
connect all the market towns of th
county by first lass vi&ds met with
hearty approval, "A few years ago 1
do not believe , that a bond issue for
roads and bridges would have met
with favor," said Mr. Lents, the bank
er, "but I think the sentiments of tha
people have undergone a change ami
that they now realize that nomethinK
of a substantial nature must be ; louo
and they realize that nothing can b
done without adequate funds."
Permanent Construction Needed.
Dr. Gordon, who is known as an en
thusiast on tho subject, takes the view
that the time has come when the peo
ple of Grady county must consider the
matter of building permanent road
and bridges. "We must begin' to looic
to the future as well as the present,''
said he. "I recently talked with Col.
Sidney Sug;, who told me about tb
good roads built in Frc'sno county,
California, at a cost of three-quarter
of a million dollars. As a result of tha
influx of people into the county and
the stream ot tourists that poured in,
attracted by good roads, traffic soon
became so heavy that they were forc
ed to rebuild their roads, using con
crete. We want to make the lasting
kind of roads in Crady county. You
can depend upon me to be on hand at
the meeting to do by part."
Town Is Thriving.
Ninnekah held' her township fair en
Tuesday, with a large crowd in at
tendance and a very creditable collec
tion of exhibits of all kinds. Much
interest was manifested and the fair
was pronounced a decided success.
Further evidence of the progressive
spirit of Nlunekah was' found in th
$:,e00 addition to the public school
building which is nearing completion.
Ninnekah lias a consolidated school,
housed in a commodious modern bric k
building, and several large vans, espe
cially equipped for the purpose, are
used to gather up the children dailv
from a large district.
Farmers are marketing considera
ble cotton in Ninnekah and the money
it is bringing is already swelling the
volume of the town's business. "When
a farmer conies in with a bale of cot
ton now, it means that we are goin?
to ttand him from $:h to $1J0 for it,"
said Mr. Lents.
Verden Enthusiastic
