Harrison boulevard, at Fort
Meigs, named in honor oC General
William Henry Harrison, defender
of the post in 1813-34, was dedi
cated Saturday afternoon.
The dedication was a feature of
the annual reunion of the Maumee
Valley Pioneer and Historical As
sociation. The event brought to
gether some of the oldest residents
of the valley.
Tlie annual basket picnic dinner
was held at noon, followed by ad
dresses and reminiscences in the
little natural ampitheater near the
burial ground of Col. Dudley's
men, on the hill. '
' President "William Corlett intro
duced the chairman of the after
noon, Judge Frank II. Baldwin of
Bowling Green. The chairman ex
tended a greeting to the pioneers
and their descendants, recalling
some of the events that had helped
to make history at Fort Meigs.
Judge Charles S. Bentley of
Cleveland read a stirring poem,
written by Philetus Smith of To
ledo. The poem was dedicated to
the men of 1812-1 !J who gave up
.their lives for their country. Mr.
Smith spoke briefly, telling of the
features that inspired him to write
the ode.
One of the interesting events of
the program was the reading of a
sonc that dates back to Colonial
times, by George Mills, 91 years
old. As a boy of 15 Mr. Mills at
tended the famous Harrison rally
in 1840 at the fort. The song was
composed in derision of the Tories
who elung to the British during
the "War of Independence. Mr.
Mills also recalled some of the
scenes of the Harrison rally.
There were barrels of hard cider
everywhere, he said, and tin cups
were tied to the barrels, so every
one might help themselves. There
was a log cabin in the southwest
corner of the fort, erected by the
Whigs, each township in northwes
tern Ohio having contributed a
rough hewn log to its construction.

The danger 6f investing in prop
erty in a town where there is no
gre protection, was made very ap
parent when the business portion of
Weston was in danger of complete
distruction because of a shortage in
the water supply Wedncssday night'

The losses arc reported as follows:

Had it not been for the timely
arrival of the Grand Rapids Com
pany with enough hose to complete
a line to the Shipman pond, the en
tire business portion of the village
would have been destroyed.
The Saxby grocery which was
damaged mostly by water, resumed
business on Saturday.
Twice the village has voted down
a 830,000 water works proposition.
SKIN GRAFTING
Old Shylock's demand of a
" pound of Hesh" seems rather
harsh to contemplate, but it don't
sound much more terrible than the
call for "30 inches of live, healthy
skin." Old Shy's demand was to sat
isfy his greed while that of the sur
geon is to cover up and make
new the arm of a boy whose skin
was burned off by contact with a
revolving belt and for which nature
calls for new skin which cannot be
grown uuless enough healthy skin
can be obtained to use in grafting
upon the exposed portion of the
arm to promote a new growth.
Vincent Wison, heretofore men-
tion in the Journal, was the patient,
and while quietly sleeping under
the influence of ether, the surgeon
removed sections of skin from the
boys thigh and transferred it to the
injured arm. The operation was one
of unusual interest requiring ex
treme care and that it was a suc
cess is evidenced by the fact that
the boy is enjoying himself and is
rapidly recovering the complete use
of his arm which would have been
practically useless had not the op
eration been performed successfully

"ye can't rent houses for our
families and therefore cannot work
in Perrysburg." This is tlie reply
that comes to Mr. Dicmcr of the
National Wheel Company when
men from out of town coma here
to work in the factory.
"We have orders," said Mr. Dic
mcr, to keep our lactory running
full time with an increased force
but we can't induce men to como
hero because they cannot find
houses to livo in. We prefer men
with families, but we can't expect
them to como to a town where
there are no houses obtainable.
Single men find it difficult to
obtain rooms and board.
From every direction the Journal
finds the help proposition a diffi
cult one to solve in Perrysburg.
There arc no houses for rent. Ho
tels and boarding house facilities
are inadequate. Only a few fami
lies are willing to rent a room.
The only hotel in town is con
stantly filled and applicants for
room and board are turned away
every day.
It would be a hard hit to Perrys
burg if the National Wheel' Com
pany would move their factory to
a town where homes and living fa-
cilitics wero obtainable for their
employees, but such action may be
necessary unless somebody gets
busy on the building propsition.
Five hundred people could be
added to the population of Perrys
burg if a sufficient number of hous
es to furnish them with homes, were
obtainable.

Sloan's Liniment for Neuralgia Aches.
The dull throb of neuralgia is uickly
relieved by Sloan's Liniment, tho uni
versal remedy for pain. Easy to apply;
it quickly penetrates without rubbing
and soothes the sore muscles. Cleaner
nnd more promptly effective than mus
sy plasters or ointment; does not stain
tho skin or clog tho pores. For stilF
muscles, chronic rheumatism, gout,
lumbago, sprains and strains it gives
quick relief. Slonn's Liniment reducos

The earliest Presidential Cam
paigns of which I have a distinct re
collection was the campaign of 18G8,
in which year the candidates on the
Republican ticket were Ulysses S.
Grant, of Illinois, for President,
and Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana,
for Vice President, and on the Dem
ocratic ticket, Horatio Seymour, of
New York, for President, and Frank
P. Blair, of Missouri, for Vice Presi
dent. I have been told many times
of the campaign of 1SG0, when
Perrysburg had a famous marching
club called the "Wide Awakes,"
but all that took place before
my "arrival."
About the first and most import
ant event of the campaign of 1SG8,
was when the Republicans of
Perrysburg and vicinity had a pole
raising. They had secured two fine
whileash trees of suitable size,
which were spliced together, and to
the top of this was added anoth
er section of blackash with the bark
stripped off. Altogether it made a
very fine pole, which I judge must
have been at least 100 feet or over
in length. The location chosen for
this pole was the southeast corner
of Louisiana avenue and second
street. On this corner was at that
time, and still is, Eberly's shoe
store. The day of the pole raising
was a bright, sunny day about the
middle of September (I think the
exact date was the 14th of the
month, but am not positive on this
point) and as there was to be a
speech making and a general jollifi
cation, there was a large crowd in
town from adjoining townships. To
add some pomp and dignity to the
occasion, in addition to music furn
ished by a brass band,arrangements
had been made for the firing of
minute guns during the raising of
the pole by the old-time Perrysburg
cannon, an old-fashioned six-pounder
which had been in the town for
many years. This ancient piece of
artillery was located on the rear of
a vacant lot fronting on Second
street, adjoining the residence of a
Mr. Schmidt, of the firm of Holli
ger and Schmidt, merchant tailors,
and which is now the residence of
Fred Yeagcr and wife. There was a
barn on the alley in the rear of the
residence of the late Micheal F.
Ilanley who resided on Front
street, and it was near this barn
that the gun was placed. The gun
crew consisted of J. Fred. Holliger,
Samuel Farher, Jr., and Henry
Williams, son of Jesse Williams,
who for several years had been the
guardian of the gun.
Knowing that the cannon was to
be used on this day, and also know-
that the best way to avoid accidents
and injury to children was to keep
them away from places where acci-.
dents and injuries could occur, my
dear old dad had very wisely en
joined mo to keep away from the
lot where tho cannon firing was to
take place, but at tho same time he
was not unwilling that I should
witness the doings of the day. So
after the "shears" which were to bo
used in raising tho polo from the
ground and placing it in the hole
made to receive it had been proper
lp adjusted, myself and a younger
brother, who also wanted to "hear
the band," found a good place
where we could see all that was go
ing on We sat down on a little
ledge under tho window of tho little
frame building which occupied the
corner of Louisiana avenue and Sec
ond street, where tho building of
the Perrysburg Banking Co. now is.
Eveytbing in connection with the
raising of the polo worked nicely

only a short time till tho big yuito

Pine Tree state returns to Re
publican column with smashing
victory, electing entire Republican
state ticket, two Republican Unit
ed State senators and the four
members of the house of represen
tatives. Milliken, Republican, defeats
Curtis, Democrat, for governor by
an estimated plurality of 12,000.
Johnson, Democratic United
States senator, is defeated on in
complete returns.
In 1914 Curtis, Democrat, was
elected governor by n "plurality of
3177.
. In 1914 the Democrats carried
the Second congressional district.
It will take the official count this
year to determine the result. The
remaining three districts are safely
Republican.
In 1912 President Wilson carried
the state by 2G20.
The state has six votes, in the
electoral college.
The normal Republican plurality
for governor in presidential years
in Maine has been about S00O.
PERRYSBURG WAS
DEFEATED AGAIN.
Perrysburg fell before the heavy

umpire and had everything to
their liking. Hitting honors go to

"WNTEREST speaks all sorts of tongues and plays all sorts of parts, even

is the ever increasing rolling snowball of money. Interest grows
