Federal Migratory Bird
Law Approved
Flagstaff, Arizona, Sept. 13.
Members of the Nortnern Ari
zona Game Protective Association
here are much pleased at recent
actiyn by Congress in thoroughly
approving the Federal Migratory
Bird Law.
Thss approval is shown in two
separate and distinct actions by
the Congress that adjourned on
Sept. 8.
On August 13 the Senate sus
tained the Federal Migratory
Bird Law by a vote of 52 to 8,
the law having been previously
approved by the House. The
particular measure was- an appro
priation of $50,000.00 to enforce
the law during the fiscal year be
ginning July 1, 1916, which ap
propriation was passed by both
houses of Congress.
On August 29 the Senate ratified
the International Migratory Bird
Protection treaty with Canada
which simply means that Canada
has now agreed to follow the
same principle that the United
States is doing in protecting mi
gratory birds during certain
months of the year, as is well
known many of our game birds
summer breed in Canada.
This specific action by Congress
will put at rest any doubts ever
entertained by anyone as to the
.constitutionality of the Federal
Migratory Bird Law.
Arizona duck hunters will do
well to read the above and re
member that the Federal Bird
Law supercedes the State bird
law and that the open season for
ducks in Arizona is from October
15 to February .1, Also the As
sociation calls attention to the
fact that all resident and non
resident Arizona licenses bear
this clause: "Where State and
Federal law conflicts, the Federal
law governs."
Also, that the Northern Arizo
na Game Protective Association
will prosecute vigorously any
violations of the Federal Migra
tory Bird law brought to its no
tice. Association members also call
attention to the fact that the
Agriculture Appropriation Act
recently passed by Congress
authorizes the creation of game
refugse on lands purchases for
forest purposes under the Weeks
Law in the Southern Appalach
ians and the New England States
which can be taken as an ap
proval by Congress of the
Chamberlain-Hayden Game Re-J
luge Bill.

Barth Hotel.
A CARD OF THANKS
We wish to express our heart
felt thanks for the great kindness
and sympathy bestowed on us in
the sad affliction and death of our
darling babe. Though we were
strangers in a strange land we
did not realize it, for we learned
to love the good people who rallied
to our aid and by kind deeds and
sympathy sought to allay our
grief. Twice in the hour of
trouble have the dear people come
to our aid and they have twined
themselves as it were 'round
our hearts by bonds too strong to
be severed, and as we said, when
our little boy was lost in the
mountains at Phoenix Park, there
can be no "barrier so strong that
we would not succumb," to aid
our dear friends, who showed by
every word and deed that they
were our friends.
With best wishes and love we
are your everlasting friends.
The Bunger Family.
The "Left" Canididate
The "left" candidate had just
got the figures footed up when
he was approached, by an old
friend who extended his hancP
and said:
"Sorry very sorry. I know I
got on 200 slips for you."
The first old" friend had only
gone when the second came in
and remarked:
"Well, that beats me. I work
ed hard all day, and I know I got
on 250 of your slips."
He went away and the third,
fourth and fifth old friends show
ed up with about the same figures.
The "left" appeared to be nettled
with the last, for he turned on
him with.
"Now, then, while I ran even
with my ticket, my friends got me
about 1,400 extra votes, and yet I
am defeated by 400 majority. I
can't figure it out."
"Oh, you can't" sneered the
old friend. "Well, if the party
makes a mistake in putting up the
unpopular man, I refuse to be
held responsible for the blunder."
