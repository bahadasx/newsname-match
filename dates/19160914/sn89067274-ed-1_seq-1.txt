The reports received from the grade
schoole Wednesday showed a total en
rollment in the two branch schools of
727 pupils, 415 of these being enroll
ed in the Central School and 312 in the
South ' Side Siool. This enrollment
is about the itune as the grade school
enrollment for last year, the grade
school enrollment running about the
same each year. No report of the en
rollment in the negro school has yet
been received.
It was estimated that there were
360 in attendance at McMillan High
School Wednesday, although it was
impossible to make an accurate count.
Regular school work began Wednes
day in all the schools.
McMillan High School was present
ed with two engravings, one of Henry
Clay, and the other of Daniel Web
ster. These pictures were the gift
of A. B. Culbertson, who presented
them to the High School before he left
here to become Presiding Elder of the
Shelbina District of the Methodist
Church. '
Many parent are moving to Mex
ico in order to be with their children
while they are in school. Superinten

and that the demand for houses has
greatly increased as the time for the
opening of the schools drew near.

In marked contrast with the open

WHAT PRESIDENT WILSON
SHOULD HAVE DONE.
REFERRING to the statement by
Roosevelt that he would have done so
and so when Wilson did otherwise,
the New York World says:
At last the final and authorative
judgement has been pronounced upon
President Wilson's successful efforts
to prevent a railroad strike. Theo
dore Roosevelt says:
My action in the anthra
cite coal strike is the meth
od, in my opinion, by which
such situations should be
handled.
What Mr. Roosevelt did in the an
thracite coal strike was to do nothing
at all until the Btrike has lasted five
months and the public consequences
had become intolerable. Then he act
ed.
By following that policy President
Wilson would have allowed the rail
roads and the brotherhoods to fight
it out until Jan. 4, 1917. Then he
would have interfered. What would
have happened to the country in the
meantime Heaven only knows, but the
President would have had the proud
gratification of knowing that he had
acted in accordance with "MY action
in the anthracite coal strike."
other States troops that have seen no
service are available. The units now
returning have done their part well
and accomplished what was required
of them. Obviously, the States will
lose no time in releasing them from
active duty and permitting them to re
sume their civilian occupations.
In spite of individual complaints
and the efforts to start a campaign
for political effect, the State regi
ments are the better for their expe
riences on the borden. They have had
a taste of real soldiering such as every
man who enlists in the National
Guard must be prepared in emergen
cy to undergo at the call of the Gov
ernment In the practical school in
which they have been training, in ten
weeks they have learned more than
they could possibly learn in years in
armory drills and at the annual state
encampments. They have seen ser
vice in the field alongside the regu
lars, and under trying conditions
shown the kind of stuff they are made
of in a way to command respect for
the organized militia.
If the National Guard is to justify
its right to occupy the place assigned
to it in the military system of the Un
ited States under the new Army Re
organization Act, it must stand ready
at all times to meet just such a situ
ation as it was called on to face last
June.

The east-bound Chicago & Alton

o'clock Wednesday morning, was de
railed Tuesday night near Bates
City, west of here. The train consist
ed of twenty three cars of meat.
None of the train crew were reported

the C . & A. was delayed several
hours and passenger trains numbers
12 and 24 detoured over the Wabash
from Kansas City to Clark.

WHEN TO PLANT TREES.

RATS IN THE CHICKEN YARD
Plan for Destroying Them at the
University of Missouri Poultry
Department.
Mrs. W. A. Schrader, of near Mex
ico, underwent a sngnc operation ai
the Mexico Hospital Wednesday morn
ing.
George A 1 wood, little son of Mr.
and Mrs. C. H. Alwood, of Middle-
town, was released from the Hospital
Wednesday.
Rats cause great losses in many
poultry yards but at the. Missouri Col
lege we have had no trouble in get
ting rid of them by poinoning with a
mixture of two parts corn meal and
one part sugar of lead. The hand
should not come in contact with the
poison feed and all other feeds should
be removed so the rats cannot get
them.
The poisoned feed may be kept away
from the chickens by putting it in a
tray, nailed to the middle of the bot
tom of a box at least a foot square
and six inches high. The box should
be closed on all sides except for a num
ber of an inch and a half holes bored
through the sides near the bottom.
Burn or bury the dead rats so that
chickens cannot cat them. The de
cayed flesh of even unpoisoned rats is
likely to cause limber neck, as pto
maine is called in chickens. H. L.

In general the full is the best time
to plant trees and shrubs on the home
grounds. When planted in the fall,
the plant is given an opportunity to
spend its strength in producing new
root growth rather than top growth.
These new roots are the "feeding"
roots and if well established will givu
added vigor to the plant the follow
ing year. The protection and health
of the root system is the most impor
tant consideration . in plant growing.
There are' some exceptions to this
rule. If the summer and fall sea
sons have been unusually dry and the
plant has suffered from drouth, it
may be best to wait until early
spring to transplant, as plants may
recuperate during the winter. In some
parts of the country late summer
planting of evergreen has proveJ
best, but for Missouri early spring
planting seems more satisfactory.
It is best to transplant all trees
and shrubs in the fall. It is possible
to move plants after they have "leaf
ed out" but there is some danger tf
over-evaporation of moisture from
the leaves and bark which will exhaust
the strength of the roots. The plant
will then show wilt and spend its
strength on new leaves instead of re.
adjusting its roots. To lessen the
danger from evaporation it is always
well to cut the tops back severely and
if in leaf, the trunk of a tree should tie
wrapped with straw or Bphagum moss
to keep it moist. Trees have been
moved as late as June 1st in central
Missouri without showing wilt, by us
ing this method. It is better to
transplant early in the morning or late
in the afternoon.
Rainy or cloudy days are the best
ones in which to do planting. Trans
plant after the leaves drop in the au
tumn or before they open in the spring
Remove injured roots, broken branch
es, and cut back the tops. Preserve
the fine hair-like roots; they are the
feeders, the others only serve as anch
ors. Never allow the roots to dry out
in the wind or sun. Cover them with
earth or wet straw. Dig the hole
much larger than the spread of the
rootsand do not bend or crowd them.
Tamp the soil firmly and closely about
the roots, but leave about two inches
of loose soil at the surface. These
planting rules are important. A
tree lives longer than a man; take
time and care in planting it, and in
general, plant in the fall. H. F. Ma
jor, Missouri College of Agriculture.
Social Service for Mexico
The social service work, which the
committee from the Women's Fede
ration of Mexico is trying to estab
lish here, is needed in the town more
than anything else just at present,
and will add much to make Mexico a
cleaner and more beautiful city.
The work will be in charge of a
trained worker who is a graduate
nurse and who knows how to solve the
problems that bo much need attention.
She will make visits to the sick and
needy of the town and will give them
any help and advice which they may
want her to give. Had there been
such a worker in Mexico last winter,
the epidemic of scarlet fever might
have been averted.
In visiting the homes of the sick
and needy, the worker will naturally
find out who needs work, and will! be
able to connect the man and the job as
she receives calls from those who
want workers of any kind.
The establishing of the charity
work of Mexico on a systematic basis
instead of the haphazard manner of
its administration for the past few
J-eara, will undoubtedly accomplish
much better results with no greater
expenditure of money, and with an
efficient charity organization and a
trained worker can be administered
in a satisfactory way. The worker
will be under the direct supervision
of a board which will hold meetings
often enough to keep m direct touch
with the field and to direct the work
er who will do anything which in the
estimation of the board is neccessary.
- The board will be composed of
members from the organizations con
tributing to the fund. In this way
the fraternal, patriotic and religious
organizations will co-operate in the
charity work of the town.
Raising the fund in advance will do
away with personal solicitation, and
the business men will he expected to
direct all charity appeals made to the
worker who will investigate and give
aid, if necessary. X.
