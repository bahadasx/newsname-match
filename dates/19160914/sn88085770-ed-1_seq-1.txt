GREATER THAN
THE'RED SPECIAL'
By J. 1.. Engdahl.
The National Socialist l ¥arty has
something greater for this year's
campaign than the great "Rod
Special" of 18081
You guessed it—THE BENSON
CAMPAIGN LEAFLETS.
There will be ten of these leaflets,
one each week for ten weeks. The
first leaflet was distributed Sunday,
August 27th; the second leaflet, Sun
day, September 3rd, and the third
leaflet will be distributed on Sunday,
September 10th, and so on to the end
of the campaign.
When this was being written one
million of "No. 1" had been sent out;
one million three hundred thousand
of "No. 2"; while plans were being
made for getting out one million five
hundred thousand of "No. 3." Addi
tional orders were still being received
in every mail for "No. 1" and "No. 2."
Since the supply of these two leaflets
has already been exhausted the or
ders for them will be transferred to
the remaining leaflets.
I make the guess that two million
copies of these leaflets will soon be
spread over the land weekly—the big
gest and mose powerful message ever
delivered to the workers of this na- I
tion in any campaign
An Increasing Audience
The fourth leaflet will reach a
greater circulation, the fifth leaflet
will go to an increased number of
workers, and so on to the tenth leaf
let that will be distributed Sunday,
November 5, on the very eve of the
national election, Tuesday, November
7th
The voices of 'Gene Debs and the
other speakers who travelled with the
"Red Special" reached only a few
thousand each day. The capitalist
press reproduced very little of their
speeches. The circulation of the So
cialist pres was small, reaching very
few non-Socialists. Nevertheless,
under these handicaps, the great "Red
Special' did noble work.
Millions Every Week
But imagine reaching one million
workers on the first week of the dis
tribution of these Benson leaflets,
more than 100,000 for each day in the
week. Now it is 200,000 each day,
then a quarter million, then perhaps
half a million a day before the cast
ing of the ballots begins; three or four
millions a week! -
This can be done!
Look at Oklahoma! The comrades
in this state will distribute 280,000
each week, and Oklahoma is only one
of the 48 states.
The distribution of these leaflets
requires more work than was needed
to arrange and attend a meeting dur
ing the tour of the "Red Special."
It will demand an organization with a
system and a brain behind it. It re
quires greater care and energy to
properly distribute 1,000 leaflets than
it does to arrange for a meeting for
1,000 persons. But if you can get
1,000 workers reading 1,000 leaflets,
you will accomplish greater good than
can be achieved by a meeting with an
attendance of 1,000. Milwaukee was
carried for Socialism by its bundle
brigade. Oklahoma will be carried
for Socialism by the farmers who
spend their nights, after the day's
work is over, riding from one farm
house to another leaving pieces of So
cialist literature behind them. The
government of the United States will
be captured by the Socialists only
after the workers of the nation have
become readers of Socialist literature.
That's why this great literature cam
paign is greater than the "Red Spe
cial.
"Kducator" for this Year
The "Red Special" was great in its
day—it was an agitator. It gripped
the imagination of men and women.
Four years and eight years from "
now we will all look back on the *
"1916 Literature Campaign" as the 'J
greatest effort of the Socialist move- t
ment up to its time. The "Red Spe- l;
cial" was an agitator. This "Litera- '-
ture Campaign" is an educator. It H
will grip the minds of men and worn- c
en. And on top of this "Literature I
Campaign" we will build the greatest
political organization this country
has ever known.
All l)c pi'mlh On You
The Success of this great work— *
this "Literature Campaign"—depends I
on the efforts of every Socialist local, '
every Socialist, every Socialist voter, t
every Socialist sympathizer in the <
land. <
Order a bunch of these leaflets for 1
distribution in your neighborhood. '
The price is 50 cents per thousand, in '•
whatever quantity you choose. 1
If you can't distribute these leaf- !
lets, you can send in a contribution to i
pay for sending these leaflets to some '
worker unable to buy them.

MOB OF EVERETT MERCHANTS AND

Gang of Hoodlum Cockroach Merchant! Armed
With Loaded Clubs and Guns, Attack
American Citizens
Soino of the most disgraceful scenes
have boon enacted in the city of Kv
ereti during tho past wook, thai have
ever disturbed the tranquility of the
City of Smokestacks.
The city has boon absolutely at the
mercy of a mob of merchants and
manufacturers armed to tho tooth.
stirring up trouble on every band.
Hoodlums Hun City
Over throe hundred of thoso hood-
Mums parade the streets nightly, caus
ing cltißeni to seek places of safety.
On Thursday and l'Yiday of hist WOOM
this nioli attacked a crowd of citizens
who were listening to a street speak
er, pulled the speaker off tho box,
grabbed several others in the crowd
and dragged then to tho county bas
tilo. When this mob arrived at the
bastile tho doors were unlocked and
j they wore permitted to enter with
their so-called prisoners. This
same band, ted by Governor Clough
and a drunk by the name of Meßae,
paraded the main streets until late at
night. On Friday this mob raided a
book >tore and unceremoniously haul
ed the occupants off to the county
bastile where, with the others previ
ously caught, they spent the night on
the cement floor.
Attack Launch
On Saturday afternoon a launch
containing 21 men and women hove
in sight of the city and drunken Me- I
Rae commandeered a boat and wont
out and fired on the incoming launch j
and with the help of the rest of his
piratical crew mauled up the occu
pants of the launch and then had them
taken to the bastile.
City Officials Helpless
The mayor and commissioner of
public safety have nothing to say in
the matter. In fact they are so scared
of losing their jobs that they dare not
offer any resistance. The mayor of
fered an apology to the citizens at the
outbreak of this trouble but has since
been compelled to take back his
words. The most prominent of this
mob are bankers, politicians and mill
owners. I
UNIONS DENIED RIGHT
TO COLLECT FUNDS
PITTSBURGH, Pa.—The persecu
tion of those convicted in connection
with the Westinghouse strike goes
merrily on. Now it is the mayor of
Pittsburgh who is using his power to
prevent funds being raised to carry
the case of the strikers to the superior
court.
In this city anybody can get permis
sion to hold a tag day for anything—
that is for anything or any institution
that is used to keep the worker con
tented.
The Trades Council of this city ask
ed the mayor, Joe Armstrong, friend
of labor before election, who hastily
decided that it was imperative for him
to take a fishing trip when the "white
wings" went on strike for $2.10 a day
and who stayed out of town until the
strike had been broken, for a permit
to hold a tag day for the benefit of
the Westinghouse strikers on Labor
Day.
This permission was refused to the
organized workers of this district for
a day that is supposed to be their day
by a mayor elected by the workers'
votes
FOOD GAMIILERS CAUGHT
IN THEIR OWN SCHEME
Food dealers who gambled on the
expected isolation of New York from
outside supplies as a result of the
threatened railroad strike and held
back .shipments to unload at famine
prices found themselves overwhelmed
by their own plot. Prices suddenly
collapsed with the averting of the
strike and the food gamblers were
caught with vast quantities of sup
plies on their hands.
LAKOR RESTLESS
The Detroit Labor News reports
thai there arc no less than 41 strikes
pending in that city at the present
time. Every branch of industry is
affected from the most skilled me
chanics down to women and children
exploited in seal) tobacco and cigar
factories. There are about a dozen
injunctions in effect and the police
seem to have completely lost their
heads. Union officials and pickets
are arrested and bundled off to jail
and strikers arc clubbed, including
women and children, in a manner that
would create envy iii the breasts of
the most hardened Russian Cossacks.
The employers' association appears to
dominate the city officials completely.
(all at Headquarters Saturday and
gel some leaflet! to distribute.
EVERETT, WASHINGTON, fHUrtSDAY, SEPT. 11. 1916.
Broken Beads
On Monday night the disgraceful
scenes were re-enacted and several
citizens received broken heads from
the loaded sticks of this fiendish gang
and several others were thrown into
the bastile.
Stripped, Beaten and Shot
The three men that were arrested
Monday evening and two others that
were taken off the train were hauled
out to the outskirts of the city, strip
ped and beaten by McKae and his
gang. One man by the name of
Rowen is in a serious condition. An
other of the name of Feinberg who
spoke on the box Monday night has
not been seen since he was taken to
the outskirts of the town. Pour shots
were heard in that direction and his
friends think that something serious
lias happened to him. Mcßae arrest
ed those men and then turned thorn
over to the mob. of armed hoodlums
who proceeded to rob and beat them
as stated above.
Little Girl Injured
A little girl 12 years old, who was
unable to move fast enough to suit
these thugs, was battered with a club
and when one considers that these
clubs are loaded with lead Ft is Indeed
a serious offense, but nobody is able
to get redress for this kind of assault.
The taxpayers of Snohomish coun
i ty will be compelled to pay for this
high-handed work, as the 19 men who
I have been jailed are each to have a
separate jury trial and this will cost
several thousand dollars. Sheriff
Mcßae is to be charged with violation
of the Federal law for arresting the
men on the launch, and several law
suit cases will be prosecuted as a re
sult of other actions of the Commer
cial club.
How long this kind of thing will go
on is hard to say. This mob is drunk
with power and no one can tell how
it will end. The., state .government
has" not sent any troops to 'stop this
disorder and so the American citizens
of this city will have to take care of
' the situation, themselves.
GERMAN ANTI-WAR
SOCIALIST ELECTED
The election of a candidate to re
present Reichenbach, an industrial
town in Prussia, near Liegnitz, re
sulted in an anti-war Socialist, Herr
Muller, topping the poll by a large
majority. His opponent was supported
by all the other parties, and the re
sult of the election is regarded as a
sign of the times, as Muller is a
strong supporter of the victimized So
cialist leader, Karl Liebknicht. The
rulers don't like the result, but as they
control the machinery of government
they will continue to jam down the
iron heel wherever they deem it nec
essary.

OWNKI) AND CONTROLLED ISY THE SOCIALIST I'AKTY OF SNOHOMISH COUNTY
BENSON'S FIRST LECTURE IN THE
CAMPAIGN DRAWS BIG AUDIENCE
Socialists' Presidential Candidate Delivers Rom
ing Lecture to Enthusiastic Audience
in Elizabeth, New Jersey
The committee In charge of the
Benson mooting looked doubtful on
Sunday lust, when the tremendous
heat forbade assemblage in a close
atmosphere of a theatre. They had
visions of an empty house, especially
when it, was learned that the other
house gave moving pictures of a re
ligious nature, without charging any
admission foe, while the Socialists
are always compelled to charge for
their meetings.
Hut soon were their fears allayed,
for a big crowd filled the Hippodrome
to greet Presidential Candidate Ben
son, who came with Comrade Goebel.
Comrade Kurber, former Mayor of
Rabway, was the first of the speak
ers to appear. Committees were busy
arranging for the book sale, a feature
of Socialist lectures.
Everybody was smiling and the
Elizabeth Socialists were proud, their
city being the first on the list of Ben
son's transcontinental speaking tour.
Benson's Hook, "Inviting War to
America," Good Seller
Within five minutes after the com
rade who had charge of the book
sales had announced the contents of
the epoch-making book, the commit
tee was besieged with demands for
the book, and, after selling out every
copy, many orders were taken for
more.
The meeting was opened with a
pleasing musical program presented
by Professor Max Flohrschuetz, musi
cal director of Upsala College, and
several of his pupil*. There had been
a large sale of tickets previous, while
many more eagerly paid amissions at
the door. A substantial sum was also
realized from the sale of campaign
buttons, pinned upon lapels by a busy
corps of pretty feminine Socialists in
the lobby of the theatre. After call
ing the meeting to order, Comrade
Furber announced future meetings
to be held, at which George R. Kirk
patrick, Socialist candidate for vice
president, will speak.
Comrade Furber Greeted Enthusiast
ically
Comrade Furber, one of the new
members of the party, formerly ma
yor of Rahway under the Republican
banner, made a strong appeal for an
indictment of the profit system, and
utilized a pamphlet issued by the re
cruiting department of the United
States navy showing the advantages
set forth aboard the fighting ships
as against chances in the industrial
fields upon which to base his argu
ments. The speaker closed with a
bitter arraignment of members of the
judiciary who go away upon vaca
tions, leaving jails crowded with pris
oners awaiting trial and unable to
obtain bail. Furber also bitterly at
tacked hypocrisy, which, he said, was
rife in many church pews and pul
pits.
Deploring the resolution against
the Socialists passed by the Catholic
Federation of Churches at their re
cent convention ni New York, he
claimed that the Catholic Church, of
all churches, because of the large per
centage of workingmen within its
folds, ought'to clasp hands with the
Socialist Party in its battle against

than asked for the present quarter.
The total appropriation since August,
1914, will amount to $12,200,000,000

the gree.-l of capital.
For years he said he had waited for
one of the older parties to end the
abuses which the workingmen suffer
ed, but he decided at last that only
a vote for a Socialstic form of gov
ernment, would eradicate the internal
cancer, the deprivation of labor of its
proper earnings by the capitalists.
Comrade George H. Goebel, of Es
sex county, being well known to Eliz
abeth Socialist audiences, was only
formally introduced by Comrade Fur
ber, who received rousing applause
at the conclusion of his interesting
talk.
National Committeeman Goebel
won constant plaudits as he empha
sized the fact that the meeting did
not mark the opening of the Socialist
campaign, explaining that the cam
paign was always on.
After arousing enthusiasm to a
high pitch, the speaker closed with an
appeal for all local Socialists to
"drop the hammer and get out the
crowbar for boosting work."
He praised the local Socialist press,
The Issue, calling the attention of the
audience to the necessity of such a
paper and urging all to support that
paper to the utmost.
Furber Introduces Benson
Allan Benson was introduced as a
"true representative of that portion
of the press which is independent" by
Chairman Furber, who also recounted
the candidate's struggle for an edu
cation, his newspaper work as edi
torial writer on the Detroit Times,
and through it all his unwavering
loyalty to Socialistic and progressive
policies.
The Elizabeth Evening Times, in a
splendid report about the meeting,
had this to say:
"As Mr. Benson stepped to the
front of the stage he was compelled
to remain mute for a lengthy period
while the theatre resounded with ap
plause. Armed with a powerful phy
sique and magnetic personality, the
speaker did not at any time resort to
Billy Sunday methods of oratory, but
delivered his address in straight
from-the- shoulder staccato sentences,
with frequent pauses to drive each
statement home. The candidate first
offered caustic criticism of the army
reorganization bill and arraigned the
Congressional committee which
amended it for the substitution of
'drafted' for the word 'called,' in ref
erence to embracing the 'unorganized
militia' in the ranks of the regulars.
"Mr. Benson then told what the
Socialist Party stands for in the com
ing campaign, and called for efficien
cy as an issue instead of platforms
advocated by other parties, winding
up his stirring plea in a manner which
aroused the audience to a high ten
sion of enthusiasm."
"The meeting was a success in
every respect," said one of the com
mittee, "and shows the interest taken
in Socialism."
Over 200 books were sold, a num
ber of subscriptions for The Issue
were secured' and many signatures
were affixed to the various nomina
tion papers.—The Issue, Elizabeth,

SWITCHMEN'S
INTERNATIONAL UNION
ENDORSES DEBS
One of the big signs showing where
the labor vote is going this year is a
proclamation just issued in behalf of
the candidacy of Eugene V. Debs by
the national officials of the Switch
men's union of North America. This
proclamation was issued in the Sep
tember issue of the Switchmen's Jour
nal, the official publication of this
great labor organization. It is exceed
ingly valuable not only on account of
the switchmen, but on account of the
moral effect it will have upon union
men in general. This is exceptional
action to be taken by railroad unions.
There is no other case that can be re
called that a national labor organiza
tion has endorsed and made an appeal
in behalf of a candidate for office.
UNION HIRES TEACHERS
DROPPED FOR UNIONISM
CHICAGO. — Thirty-eight union
school teachers, discharged because
they belonged to the Teachers' federa
tion, went to work today on the open
ing of school as business agents of
the Chicago Federation of Labor.
Teachers who have been employed
by the school board to take the places
of the discharged teachers will be re
garded as strike breakers, according
to officials of the federation.
Chicago labor is waging a relentless
war on Mayor Thompson because of
his refusal to restore the "merit rule"
in the city schools.

THE DIME BANK
5,000 Hanks Raising Record Socialist
Campaign Fund
By MAX SHEROVER,
Manager Million Dime Campaign
Fund.
FIFTY THOUSAND DIMES to
ward the Million Dime Campaign
Fund being raised by the Socialist
Party have already been received.
Fifty thousand dimes from as many
workers throughout the country.
Fifty thousand dimes representing
that many little self sacrifices and
self denials, thrown into a pot to
make one huge working class fight
ing campaign fund.
No other party in the history of the
working class can boast of such fund.
It is a truly proletarian campaign
fund. It consists of hard earned,
blood and sweat dimes that workers
have contributed. The Million Dime
Campaign Fund has taken hold of the
imagination of the rank and file of
the Socialist Movement as nothing
else heretofore. The aim set is a Mil
lion Dimes, One Hundred Thousand
Dollars, and we are going to get it.
There are at least one million work
ers who are going to give one dime
at a time to fight capitalism. And
this year we are going to fight capi
talism with a spirit that will throw
fear into the herats of the plutes.
Make i' One Million
Fifty thousand dimes is a good
start. We must make it a Million.
The chain letters, dime cards are still
in circulation. They can still be had
for the asking. But the big feature
now is the DIME BANK.
The National Executive Committee
of the Socialist Party at its last meet
ing has gone over the plan in detail
and given it its most serious consider
ation. The committee then authorized
the purchase of 5,000 Dime Banks to
be used in raising a huge campaign
fund not only for the national office
but for the local and state organiza
tions throughout the country.
The new plan in brief is to divide
the proceeds of the Million Dime Fund
between the local, state and national
organizations on the following basis:
On all' contents- recei v gj fai "barflis' ~
coming from a given city, the local
in that city will be credited with 25
per cent., the state in which that city
is located will be credited with 25 per
cent., and the balance of 50 per cent,
will be retained by the National Of
fice of the Socialist Party, which will
finance the entire expense of the
banks, shipping, overhead expenses,
et cetera.
This is an additional opportunity
for the members of the Socialist Par
ty to do some team work. By keep
ing a bank busy you are at one stroke
helping your local, your state and the
national office.
What 1,000,000 Dimes Will Do
One Million Dimes will work won
ders in Socialist; agitation. It will
keep a veritable army of speakers and
organizers in the field. It will work
huge presses over-time turning out
Socialist leaflets by the millions. It
will bring the Socialist message to
the doors of the workers of the coun
try. It will make Socialism the issue
of the hour. It will awaken workers
to thought and action. It will roll up
an enormous vote for Socialism. It
will elect able comrades to local, state
and national legislative bodies. It
will bring the day of working class
emancipation nearer.
The 5,000 banks are in circulation
now. The percentage to 1^ credited
to the states and locals will be check
ed off on all banks reaching the Na
tional Office after September Ist.
Every local secretary in Washington,
California, Texas, Nevada, Minne
sota and Colorado has received a
bank. Local secretaries in other
states will receive their banks short
ly. Members of locals and readers
of the American Socialist throughout
the country can have a bank for cir
culation by writing for it to the Mil
lion Dime Department, Socialist Par
ty, 803 West Madison Street, Chicago,
111. There is always a large waiting
list of friends and comrades who are
awaiting their turn for a bank. Send
your name in now and you will get
your hank at the first opportunity.
The bank is a round small celluloid
affair that will easily fit the vest
pocket.
Send for your bank now. Work for
your local, state and national organi
zation. Let us all pull together.
Team work, team work and more
team work.
