NEW LYRIC THEATRE
NEARING COMPLETION
WILL BE ONE OF THE PREIIIESI SHOW SHOPS
IN IHE MILK RIVER VALLEY
Since L. H. Ugland purchased the.
old. Bison theatre from Wallace Co
burn some wonderful changes have
been going on there, and it is now
nearly ready for the opening which
Manager Robbins hopes will take
place about Sept. 20th. An openihg
dance will he given at the new thea-'
tre Saturday evening, hut no pic
tures will he shown that night and
the formal opening of the house will
occur at a later date.
The name has been changed to
the new Lyric theatre and hereafter
it will he known as that and under
the management of Raymond Rob
bins it will, no doubt, be one of the
best little theatres along the line.
The stage has all been remodeled
and, two 6x8 dressing rooms put in
at the rear, and the stage enlarged
*to 15x25 feet, instead of 1.0x20, as
formerly. The exit doors at the
rear have been cut through the solid
concrete wall, and as they open in
the. alley will give ample means of
escape in case of fire. The ventilat
ing of the new house has been well
taken care of by instalMng" of four
wall fans and an immense exhaust
fan in the roof, the latter changing
the air completely every twelve min
utes independent of any other means
of ventilation.
Four elevated boxes have been
put in at the rear, the upper ones
containing four seats and the lower
ones three seats each. There will he
two main aisles and the seating ca
pacity will be about three hundred
and fifty.
Thirty feet ha.$ il:n; cut off of the
front end of the building and the
sides converted into two 7x10) foot
office rooms and a large ticket ofliee
in the mitddle of the entrance. Over
the sidewalk in front of the house is

a new 10 foot marquette and the
lobby will be large and roomy as, It
is 15 feet deep. This will prove a
great convenience to patrons, es
pecially on a rainy night or when
there is some big attraction playing
and people are compelled to wait to
get tickets.
i4artlst Spencer has done some
great work in interior decorating
in the new house and the pretty
panel effect is very attractive. The
carpenter work has been under the
supervision of Frank McNamara and
shows he he knows how to handle
any and all kinds of work. The
plumbing was put in by the Malta
Plumbing company under the direc
tion of Ed. Siegert in their usual up
to-date manner.
The new engine has arrived and
is being installed this week. It is
a four cylinder Universal engine
built something like an auto engine
and with this there will be hardly
any excuse for the customary 'en
gine trouble," as they will not lay
down like the smaller engine, but
keep things moving as long as there
is plenty of gas.
Taken as a. whole the new Lyric
will be one of the neatest little show
shops in northern Montana and Mr.
Ugland and Manager Robbins are to
he congratulated for having gone to
so much trouble for the movie fans
of this city, and they will, no doubt,
receive the patronage they merit for
having done so.

H4UGA II BEET MEN
SUENI) DAY IN MALTA.
W. L. Lawson, manager of the
Billings, Missoula and Lovell, Wyo.,
factories of the Great Western
Sugar company, and Judge Henry H.
Rolapp of Salta Lake City, Utah,
president of tihe U. S. Sugar Manu
facturers' association, spent the
greater part of last Saturday in this,
vicinity investigating the prospects
for tile establishment in the Milk
River valley of a factory for the pro
dluction of beet sugar. They ex
p~ressed themselves as keenly disap
pointed with some of the conditions
in the valley, as they expected to see
irrigation farther developed than is
the case. They spoke very highly pf
the quality of the sugar beets raised
here and expressed themselves em
pihatically confident that this valley
could produce the quality of sugar
beet which they desire for the pro
duction of 'beet sugar. Mr. Lawson
urged all those present at the meet
ing which, was held in the Court
chambers, to preach the planting of
Alfalfa on all irrigable lands. In
this way the soil would be prepared
for the planting of sugar beets and
he stated very definitely that just
as soon as he could he shown 10,000
acres of afifalfa in the Milk River
valley, that they would begin prep
aration for the erection of a sugar
beet factory. The Great Western
Sugar company is a very strong con
cern financially, and they do not ask
nor will they accept any bonus for
tile location of their factory, as the
factory is located entirely with ref
erence to the conditions, and when
the ficld is ready, they come in and
buty the necessary land at the market
price. There is no question but
what the raising of aug " beets will
be one of the most profitable kinds
of agricultulre which this valley
could enter, and we feel that all
those having land capable of being
irrigated can ll (no0 better than to
follow the advice of Mr. ah~wson to
plant. Alfalfa in preparation for the
ulltnimate object of making this a
great liee growing section, which in
Colorado and Wyoming and south

Malta has been made the central
location for many of the scenes of
the first Great West feature film,
entitled 'The Golden Goddess," a
story of the northwest adapted from
Wallace D. Coburn's poem, "Yellow
stone Pete's only Daughter."
Twenty-four hours after their ar
rival, Director General Chas. W.

"shoot" and Malta has been a movie
town ever since. With the comple

the foot of the Little Rockies.
The Great W~est Film company
has provedl itself ambitious from the
standpoint of detnanding the exact,
proper color scheme for each atnd
every scene of their pictures.
