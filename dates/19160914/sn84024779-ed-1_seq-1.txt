IN MEIHORIAM.
Candida Pax. Sept- 4, 1916
William H. White, 32, the
pioneer citizen of Fargo and
North Dakota has been called
into the blessed, endless pro
gression of Jehovah. His was a
well rounded life in the circle of
religion, social, and philanthro
pic effort. He was a noble busi
ness man, but held the wealth of
the world in trust for God, home,
humanity, and the upbuilding of
the state of which he was a no
ble pioneer. He sought out suf
fering av|J journeyed many a
mile to cast the sunshine of his
presence in the sick room and
minister of his bounty in a very
silent way to the afflicted fam
ily- He disliked moderism when
it bore the mark of the ether^l
and unreal. He truly exemplified
•the philosophy of fidelity, as ex
pressed in the Fatherhood of
God, and the Brotherhood of
