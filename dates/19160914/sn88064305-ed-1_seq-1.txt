Congressional Race Is Close
With the weather delightfully
cool, tho a little threatening ear

liveliest possible interest mani
fested.
In the Congressional race Poi

precinct except Bogalusa, Rio,
Varnado and Hackley at which
places Sanders scored so well
as to make tie final majority for
Ponder in Washington Parish,
just 123. Returns from other
parishes in District are not com
plete at this time thbo the race
seems close with the imcomplete
returns showing Sanders slight
ly in the lead. Both sides claim

Printer's Ink.
Priliter'9 ink is a combination
of lamp black and brains which
umakes dollars grow in place of
dimes. If it had not been for the
judiious use of printer's ink and
the Cardiff giant P. T. Barnum
would never have been heard of
outside of his front yard and
John Wanamaker would still be
doing business in a hat box, with
a turn-over of $400 per annum.
Printer's ink is the cheapest
form of publicity known, next to
telling a secret to one's wife, and
yet there have been thousands of
men who never found it out until
it was too late to make terms with
the referee in bankruptcy. All
along the highway of life are
scattered the whightening skele
tons of promising business ven
tures which started out with a
large bank bala;o-e and no other
form of publicity except regular
attendance upo[, the meetings of
the official board. One by one
the proprietors discovered that
they were catering largely to
their immediate relatives and a
willing class of trade with genial
manners but no collateral, and
before long the community was
sh''cked by a (lull, imuffld ex
plosion caused by a sheriff's sale
notice comier, in contact with a
cylinder press.
Nearly all of the merchants
who have failed because people
could not rem-ember whether th-y
were .till icn bthu i, ,,o s did .imot uQ.
any form of plrinter's ink exceipt
the rubber stamp. The rubber'
stamp is all right i its place, but
For District Attorney of
course exciternent here run high
as local interests are more great
ly concerned, and the good m:i
jurity given by Washington Par
ish to Brock over both his oppo
nents made the scene at the re
turning stations lively and
spirited. Brock's total was 869,
Heintz 538, and Moise 196.
St. Tammany almost evened
things with her two sons, Heintz
sc')ring 490. and Moise 460,
while the Washington Parish
candidate polled 315 of the St.
Tammy votes. Moise's strength
will go almost solidly to Brock
in the second primary and it is
generally conceded that Brock's
majority in the final contest will
be overwhelming
as a means of getting business it
is as helpless as a one-legged
man on a milk stool. Nobody
ever heard of a rubber stamp go
ing out into the country and drag
ging in a bunch of rural custom
ers who can tell a bargain without
being laid open just above the
eyes with a club. The man who
relies upon the rubber stamp and
the fact that he married into the
Smith family, as a substitute for
printer's ink, will be able to hold
his annual clearance sale without
suffocating any of his trade.
All of our great merchant
princes landed in the king row
by buying huge printer's ink and
spreading it over two pages
crammed fnllof lingerie cuts and
enticing price figures. The auto
mobile industry owes more to
printer's ink than it does to the
fitful self-starter, which some
times fits and sometimes starts.
In view of these plain statements
of undying truth, the jury will
now retire and render judgment
upon the good citizen, kind
neighbor and loyal friend who
says it doesn't pay to advertise
and knows because he never
tried it.
Baron Burian, Austro-Hun
gary's minister of foreign affairs,
said his country would welcome

The thrift and general prosper
ity for the farmer is indicated by
the method employed in caring
for his tools and agricultural im
plements. Figures speak for
themselves, and the progressive
efficient, and money making man,
accepts the story which tLeyTell
and profits thereby.
In the year 1900 the value of
all farm property, in the shape of
farm implements and machinery,
was 8749,775,970. In 1910 this
same value has increased to
$1,255,147,783, representing an
increase of 68.7 per cent. Tuese
figures mean that the farmers
are relizing the benefit to be de
rived from the use of labor saving
imachinervy.
In 1900 the eierage of improv
ed lands and farnfb was 414.498,
489; in 1910 this became 478,
451,750--an increase of only 15.4
per cent. Therefore, in 1900
there was $1.80 worth of machin
ery for each acre of improved
farm land, while in 1910 this had
increased to $2.65, or an increase
of 47 per cent.
With so much capital invested
in equipment, the farmes is cer
tainly a bad business man if he
does not take some steps to pro
tect his tools and agricultural im
plements to reduce the deprecia
tion and to increase it's length of
life. A fair estimate of the aver.
age value of machinery on a farm
is $1000 and the farmer who gives
no care and attention to his tools
and implements will have an an
nual reduction, in their value, of
approximately $200, besides his
interest charge of $60 on his in
vestment. The farmer who prop
erly houses his machinery will
have an annual deduction of
$66.66 for depreciation, and the
same interest charge of $60, a
saving therefore, of $133.34 per
annum. The saving on machin
ery properly housed will pay for
a shed in two or three years.
The annual saving above re
ferred to does not take into con
sideration the advantages that
accrue in haviilfi a machine that
will operate when it is called upon
to do so; the addei value the
building itself gives the farm; the
additional prestige which will re
dound to the owner of the farm
The Great Southern Lumber
Company, who are vitally inter
ested in the agricultural welfare
of this community, have arranged
to furnish the farmers of Wash
ington Parish, with the plans for
an implement and tool shed,
which is.modern in every way,
and which can be erected at a
very small cost,
The tanking care of, and the
housing of farming implements
and tools, is an important ques
tion to each and everyone of us.
Shiftlessness, waste, lack of
energy, constant buying, and
heavy burdens of debt will ac
company poor care. Good care is
an indication of shrewdness, busne
iness ability, long lived machin
ery, good bank balances, and the
assurance of a peaceful and pros
perous future.

'What Do Yon Know?'
How many times have yon º
been asked this identical question I
by the editor of this paper? Too
many times to remennbar, per- t
haps.
Now let us suggest that you c
change the accepted order of pro.
ceedure for one that would be a
vast improvement.
Instead of waiting for us to C
ask you, suppose you just take s
the initiative and tell us, or write ¶
us,or phone us what you know in
the nature of news.
That little piece of information s
you have revolving around in 1
your cranium may not be of t
great importance to you, but to
others it may be of vital intsrest 1
-may even be of considerable r
value.
Every piece of news you read
in this paper we have reoieved
from some source or other. The
efforts of these people make the 1
paper of greater interest and
value to you.
Now suppose you reciprocate
and do as much for them. Tell I
us what you know.
