MISSOURI MILITIA.
.Special Ik'iultl Cniwipoiult lit.
Laredo, Tex., Sept. U. Com
pany "B" with two other com
panies are doing guard duty with
the 2nd Missouri. Maine and
New Hampshire being on duty.
It is up to the Fourth to sou that
everything is properly guarded.
After doing guard duty Company
"13" was up before day making a
hike in heavy tnarchinir order and
standing inspection. As it was
wry hot the boys seemed wearied
when they arrived at cam p.
After standing one inspection on
the field there will bo another of
the small arms by thu general
inspector.
The boys are wishing for the
return of the other regiments, as
it is too much work for them,
though they say they are able to
stand almost anything.
The boys look anxiously for
pay day, but don't seem to have
much pleasure after it comes,
as no man is permitted to leave
camp for several days after eacli
pay day.
Company "B"has been called
upon for men almost every d.iy
this week. One squad was sent
to guard the truck train whiuh
was carrying supplies to the
Maine regiment 07 miles up the
river where out post duty is be
ing done. Kadi company along
ttie border lias a fort, also
I trenches. They are stationed 1 1
miles apart, eacli company hav
ing a certain amount of territory
to guard.
The desert country looks hot
and dry, all that can be seen is
mosquitoes and cactus.
Pay day was sounded yester
day and at last in the afternoon
the regiment was paid and then
ordered to the target range, and
it is expected that the Fourth
will bo moving in a few days, and
it is hoped that it won't be toward
the range, but toward Pemiscot
county.
As orders are moving fast,
Capt. Reeves is kept busy almost
day and night with the track full
of coaches. The boys are in
great spirit, being as optimistic
as possible, and thinking that
they are to be allowed to go home.
The recruiting officers left Tues
day for Missouri. Company "B"
had the pleasure of telling Serg.
Culpepper goodbye, hoping him
luck and that he might not have
to return.
Mrs. E. S. Huffman left Mon
day for Carutliersville. Capt.
Ed says we can all be at home by
the lirst.

I The following letter was re
I ceived by G. It. Henderson, Pre
siding Judge of the County
' Court, and it perhaps conveys a
, very serious message to our peo
' pie. The Judge was in our office
Tuesday and we have his per
mission tu publish same. Here
it is:
Kai'inington, Mo., August 26, 1010.
i G. H. Hi:n'oi:uson,
. 1'res. .liaise County Court of Pemiscot
County,
Koust, Missouri.
My dear Judge:
We have had occasion to write you
and the various members of your
court a number of times regarding
your arrearage with the hospltul.
Some three weeks ago I eent a tele
gram of inquiry toyourCounty Clerk,
and she replied to me that our ac
count would be allowed on August
14th, since which time we have been
daily expecting the same. But, inas
much as it did not arrive on what we
thought to bo schedule time, I sent
yonr County Clerk another telegram
on August !2oth, making inquiry as to
why our money had not as yet been
received at the hospital, and on this
morning's mull I received u letter
from your Clerk saying that the bill
lias not yet even been allowed, for
the reason that the County Court had
not been able to get anyone to hold
the warrant.
Now, Judge, we at this end of the
line are very much disappointed; we
dislike to have to write you so many
times concerning the kpep of your
wards ut the hospital. If you will
remember, for the last two or three
years it has been alruoBt like pulling
eye-teeth to get a settlement with your
county on time, and we have aoout
arrived ut the conclusion as we did
on one former occasion that unless
we receive compensation for the keep
of your wards, that we will not be
able to cure for them as we should,
and therefore, according to the Stat
utes of the State of Missouri, (Sec.
1447, K. S. Mo. 190'J), wo will be com
pelled to return to your county, to
to the custody of your Sheriff, all
of your wards, numbering thirty-four.
Judge Henderson, this is simply a
business proposition with us here at
the hospital, and we want to assure you
that we have no desire whatsoever to
impose upon your county when ,ou
are in straitened financial circumstance-,
but on tho other hand we tire
compelled to look after our own in
terests and protect and run our own
institution.
In conclusion, we will say to you
Unit alilioLgh your account, in tho
-urn of 32,223.33 has been due and
payable since April 1st, we will wait a
reuaonablo time on you, giving you
und your Court further opportunity
to make suitable financial arrange
ments regarding your account with
UN, and then, at the end of that time,
if j our county is really bankrupt and
.annot pay for the keep of your wants
at tho hospitnl, we will have to send
litem down to you and let you keep
them ut home. Wo would dislike very
much to be compelled to take this ac
tion, but, as 1 above stated, if you
are reallv not able to nav for the euro
and keep of them, according to the
main,
Most respectfuully yours,
G. B. SCRUTCHF1ELD,
Supt.
1', S. Judge, your account with us
will again be due on October 1st, and
might I not suggest that while you
are preparing to pay your arrearage,
due since April IbI. that you also
make provision at the same time for
meeting your October account, for we
must insist that the October bill be
promptly paid. G. E. S.

As yet the Herald has not had
opportunity enough to investi
gate the case fully, but will do
so as soon as possible and will
give our people more light.
We are reliably informed that
for several months the county
has had to borrow money in the
sum of around about $5,000 to
pay for the upkeep of these in
sane people. But the trouble
came sometime ago when the
county board of equalization was
in session. We understand that
the presiding judge favored
making an additional levy of 20
cents on the hundred dollars for
Uie purpose of above, but at this
time the primary was in a warm
way. After the board had been
in session for about four days,
and upon solicitation from sever
al prominent business and finan
cial men from Carutliersville
asking and advising the board to
make the proposed levy, the
majority of the board could not
see it in this light and adjourned
-vithout making necessary ar
rangements to take care of the
wards.
For the past two years this ac
count had been met by loans
from the Bank of Carutliersville,
through it president, but after
the board had failed to make pro
per arrangements for the meet
iug of its obligations, the bank
did not feel justified in making
further loans.
And now, after it is too late to
remedy, we are face to face with
a matter that should have deep
thought, else Pemiscot county is
going to have the other depart
ment of its wards on the public,
roaming over the country at
large.
As the Herald understands
matters this amount of $2,223.3!!
is and has been due since Anril
unit keep of them, according to tiiui
StntmeH, we must send them back toj 1st, last, and that a like sum be-
yoti-wt) ha-e , no other course. 1 comes duo the nrst of October,
Hoping that we have madonui-helves .
plain on this business proposition, ' anrt lt ls lllfel-V that tlle mstltu
and ngain assuring you thai we have1 tion will send these wards to our
no desire whatsoever to ho arbitrary ; county if the money is not forth
w th you in tliu matter. I beg to n- coming .soon.
Thursday afternoon of last
week while Cal Chism and daugh
ters were motoring from this city
to their homo near Concord they
seemed to strike a bed of carpet
tacks and small nails. His
car picked up. four tacks and
one three-penny nail which re
sulted in three punctures. Peo
ple who would scatter tacks and
nails so as to cause injury and
trouble to autotnobilists should
be dealt with roughly.
Apple hats, kid gloves, stylish ties,
everything for young men, at Buck
ley's. Geo. Dorris, .las. Myers, L. C.
Averill, L L. Lefler, T. A. Fore
man and Ophie Shepard formed
a camping party, who left Wed
nesday afternoon by automobiles
for the lower end of the county
for several days hunting and
camping. It is needless to say
that the squirrels had better
make themselves scarce with
this bunch of sportmen in the
woods.
Guy Jackson, who has been
visiting his brother, J. T. Jack
son, is now in Caruth, but will
return in a few days and will
work for the Little River Drain
age District, of which the resi
dent engineer's office is in this
city.
Apple hats and caps are the best.

last week and is visiting at the

Hayti High School has the
distinction of having 14 non-resident
students. This certainly
speaks well in which the esteem
our school is held.

Sarah Coatney and Russell
Frakes of Steele entered High
School Monday. Both are de
serving pupils who have finished
all their home school offers. They
have come to our school to se

most hearty welcome.
The foot ball boys organized
last week by electing Roy Harper
captain and Walter Dorris treas
urer. We hope the boys may
have a good season.
The total enrollment to date
(Tuesday) is 387.
As you know, our class of 1918
was composed of five members,
as follows: Bonnie Hart, Blair
Buckley, Lillie Sprayberry,
Isaiah Faris and Harry Gettings.
We mention these names be
cause of the unusually good
example they are setting for
other classes which are to follow
them. All of them are entering
higher institutions of learning.
Bonnie Hart, Lillie Sprayberry
and Harry Gettings have en
tered the State Normal School at
Cape Girardeau. Blair Buckley
and Isaiah Faris leave Thurday
for the University of Missouri,
at Columbia. We believe that a
record like this will not be
equaled by any 1916 class in this
section of the State. To say that
we are proud of them is to put it
rather lightly.
Miss Pickens is beginning to
get the girls in readiness for
basket ball and thinks she will
have a team that will make a
record at least equal to the
record which will be made by
Mr. Brooks' foot ball squad.
R. E. Seitz, representing
Lyons and Carnahan, publishers,
