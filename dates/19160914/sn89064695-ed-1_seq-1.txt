arlE. Swansson Against
Steenerson.
The democratic candidate for
Congress in the Ninth District
against Congressman Steenerson
this year is Carl E. Swansson.
Mr. Swansson was educated in
Europe and emigrated to this
country when he was sixteen years
of age. After working on farms,
in factories, mines, railroads, etc.,
he enlisted in the United States
Army where he served seven
years.
While in the army Mr. Swans
son was Seduced by Captain \V.
W. K. Hamilton to engage in Jit
erary work, and the result was
that in 1918, "Social Wrcngs",
was published, which deals with
economic and political problems.
In the spring of 19U, Mr.
Swansson wrote 'The American
Army", part of which work \va
embodied in the Congressional
Recordi March.

President Wilson has been
charged with being too vacillating
in his policy of dealing with pub
lic affairs, but the masses, accord
ing to expressions heard from all

From a school teacher, Presi
dent Wilson has become one of the
greatest statesmen of the age.
Had sentiment remained as it
was apparently a year ago, Presi

been re elected as president, but
it has changed to such a remark

Wrpyfrom every-day discussions hsard

press the bill to a final conclusion.
The reservation vote gave Mr.
Steenerson his nomination, for
outside of the reservation Judge
Grindeland, who is better than an
average man but was not then
known to anyone on the reserva
tion, had him defeated.
Mr. Steenerson learned
be fore the primary election that
the Waller bill was not popular
here in this county or in Mahno
men county, he telegraphed to
Washington to have it withdrawn,
but after his nomination he had it
reinstated. This is a fair illustra
tion of the reliance which can be
placed on Mr. Steenerson in pub
lic matters.
Will Hold A Meeting.
Some of the residents of this
town are discussing the advisabil
ity of holding a meeting for the
purpose of taking some steps to
bring before, the United States
courts the amendment to the In
dian appropriation act of last May
with the view to having it en
forced.
So many applications for posi
tions the Chippewa service by
members of the Chippewas of
Minnesota bands have been re
jected by Supt. Hinton upon this
reservation and by the Indian
office at Washington, that it is
deemed necessary by the appli
cants to employ some attorney at
Washington to mandamus the
Secretary of the Interior and Com
missioner of Indian Affairs in or
der to compel them to observe the
law with regard to the employ
ment of Indians.

Mr. Steenerson fulfilled his part Chippewa tribal

then has"done absolutely nothing fund that it is hard to form any
opinion how it will be paid, and
on behalf of the reservation pro

bills which are against the inter
ests of the members of this reser

Washington several times to lobby
through Congress with the aid of
Mr. Steenerson, and the bill which
proposes to take away from the
Indians their celebration grounds,
and these two bills were introduc
ed by Mr. Steenerson, and have
his hearty support.
The Waller bill is a measure
which proposes to legalize all the
land sales upon this reservation
whether fraudulently obtained or
whether legally so, or not, relative
to inherited allotments.

So many wild rumors are afloat
regarding the manner in which the
division of the on^-fourth of the

in the bill which provided that all
Cedar Rapids, while not as near self-supporting Chippewas should
to Indian reservations as might
induce a laige attendance of In
dians, is an improvement on Kan
-as City, Mo., where the meeting
was held last year, and there
might be a better attendance than
there was at Kansas City.
The society should adopt the
policy of holding its Oieetings
nearer Indian reservations than it
has been in the habit of doing, for
only in this way can it hope to se
cure the attendance of Iudians and
make its object a success which up
to the present time has not been
the case.
receive immediately their per

missioner Merritt promised the
delegates if they would not insist
upon having this clause inserted
in the bill a most liberal construc
tion would be placed upon it, and
only in necessary easea would In
dian moneys be with-held.
There has bpen so much fraud

among those whose mouey will be
with-held to having any paid to
them without being entered in a
memorandum for this purpose
which should be held by them.
The opposition on the part of
the officials to paying out individ
ual Chippewa funds in the past has
a those entitled to in the parent it has been a common
over
out restrictions being placed
them.
It is rumored that the ware-
portion of their funds each month,
and while some express satisfac
tion at this arrangement there are
others who have much to say
against it.
It is also stated that minors will
receive but a small amount, if any,
of their shares of the fund, aud
that persons who are addicted to
the use of intoxicants will not re
ceive any, or who are charged
with being "blind piggers."
The question naturally arises,
who is to decide who are "blind
piggers" and who are not? Any
one can be charged with being a
blind pigger but the proof is nec
essary to show this. The mere
statement by anyone, whether he
be an officer or no&, that a certain
person is a blind pigger should be
susceptible of proof, for to bestow
upon any one the right to charge
another with h^ing a violator of
United States law without com
pelling him to prove it, would be
contrary to the policy and laws of
the country. .'^e&$*
If a mem'ber of trie "tribe is'selling
intoxicants in violation of law, he
should be prosecuted and punished,
but he should not be deprived of
anything which is his by right of
inheritance, and every member of
this reservation obtains these
rights by inheritance. In order
to receive his share of the amount
that is to be paid from Chippewa
tribal funds all that should be re
quired is that the person should
be self-supporting.
Persons addicted to the use of
intoxicants should have no restric
tions placed upon them, for it
would only be encouraging them
to 'ndulge more freely in the habit
as all they would have to do would
be to obtain enough work to get
money to buy whiskey and rely
on their monthly payment for
their subsistance.
The Indian office at Washing
ton would do the Chippewas of
this reservation a great service to
immediately pay all those who are
suspected of being blind piggers,
for the sooner (hey suend their
share of the tribal fund to which
they are entitled the better it
would be for the reservation
people at largo, for then they
might cease to hang around the
agency which they would do every
month if their shares were with
held.
The delegation that went to
Washington last winter had a pro
purpose so clearly ap
charge that what should have been
derived as interest has not been
paid, or less than the actual
amount of t*he interest has been
paid that there have been in
stances where even a part of the
principal was not paid.
Civil Service Reform.
To the Editor of The Journal:
I cannot, without protest as a
democrat, allow you to get away
with the statement that the civil
service reform act is a republican
measure. It was introduced in
1883 by Senator George II. Pen
dleton of Ohio, whose democracy
is sufficiently attested by the fact
that he was once the candidate for
vice president on the democratic
ticket. Your contention that the
law is a republican measure would
remind one of a boy who by the
united energies, bribes and threats
of the household and the family
physician, had been placed in
propet relation to a dose of castor
oil and who afterwards boasted of
his stoicism under the trying or
deal.
If credit should be given any
paj^in the establishment of this
reform, it "should be given to the
labor reform party which was the
T,his
first to declare for it in a national
platform -in 1872.
George William Curtis gave the
movement a tremendous boost,
which culminated in the adoption
of Senator Pendleton's bill. The
democratic landslide in the con
gressioral elections of 1882 was
another potent prod that recon
ciled the republicans to their dose
of political castor oil.Minne
apolis Journal.
If the foregoing statement is
correct, it is not the credit of
the democratic party tliat it is
responsible for the civil service
reform (I) law. Not one person
in every hundred cares or favors
the law, and prejudices are arising
everywheie against it because the
change of presidents make no
changes in the general policy of
the government such as is desired
by the American people.
It docs not escape notice either
that the prejudices which arise
among civil service employees do
not disappear with the change of
administrations from one party
to another, but the same condi
tions continue to exist regardless
of the party in power to the detri
ment of the party and the govern
mert service. No where in the
government service is this more
noticable than in the Indian ser
vice, where greater advantage is
taken by employees than in any
other branch of the government
service.

those who were in a position to

do anything without first consult
ing him or Mr. Six, and for ttuir
errors the superintendent is held
responsible, or for their partisan

Candidate Hughes has come out
so strongly in favor of the civil
service law that it will no doubt
have a stronger effect towards de
feating him than any other i-sue
ho has raised, if general sentiment
as heard on every hand is any
criterion of the wishes of the ma
jority not only in one locality but

system. Under the former systt
no such combinations as exist ui
