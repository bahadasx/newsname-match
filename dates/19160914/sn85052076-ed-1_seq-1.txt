What are Officers For?
"What is everybody's business is nobody's business"
is an old saying. We have magistrates and officers to
look after the business of the community.
. But who is to act as "boss" for these "public serv
ants"? Who will praise them when they do well, and dis
charge them when they do badly? Every citizen ought
to give serious attention to the interest of the community,
and try to speak truthfully and calmly about them. An
office-holder who works only for the honor or salary
ought to be found out and turned out. -But an office
holder who does his duty forthe public good without fear
or favor ought to be praised and actively supported.
What is a Christian?
A Christian is a person who ! lieves in Christ and is
seeking first of all to serve Him.
We had a Chapel full of Christians at the Methodist
Conference last week.
But when the Bishop finally gave out the appoint
ments there were some who showed they were not Christ
ians by complaning of the places to which they were sent.
A Christian, brethern, must be able to mean it when he
sings, "Anything, anywhere, for Jesus.".
The Courthouse
The Citizen gave a word recently regarding the dis
reputable conditions of our many courthouses through
out Kentucky, and the matter has attracted wide atten
tion. From some counties where the courthouses are
nicely kept there comesa word of protest. We are glad
to commend the improved care which is given to public
buildings in several counties Madison for one. We hope
that the good example may be contagious.
Now let us add that the people who are in the court
houses and the other magistrates of our counties have im
portant duties which are sometimes neglected. Every
citizen ought to call over the list of office holders in his
vicinity, and be ready to commend and stand" by those
who do their duty, and to condemn and replace those
who shirk. There should be more sifting in a number
of places and the southern end of Madison County is one
of the places where improvements could be made. We
have faithful and efficient officers and we have others that
are less so.

SUBWAY'SURFACE LINES KIT
Public Strvlcve Commission Invests
gatta Charges of Brutal Treatment
of Strikebreaker by Railway Linca
In Order to Keep Thorn at Work.
New York, Sept 12. With surface
ear transit virtually at a standstill in
Manhattan, the Bronx, Yonker and
BetMatcheatar county, and with
subway and elevated facilities affected
more than at any time since the Inter
borough Rapid Transit strike was
called last Thursday, the traction sit
uation in New York assumed a more
serious aspect.
Efforts were made during the day
In conferences by labor leaders to
seek a sympathetic strike among vari
ous crafts, which, if successful, would
call out 750.000 workers In the Metro
politan district, but it waauadmitted
that no definite action , could be ex
pected for at least a week, he first
demonstration of a sympathetic strike
came when union teamsters employed
by two brick making concerns quit
i their posts rather than haul sand to
I the New York Railway company power
houses.
Hugh Frayne, an organizer of the
i American Federation of Labor, pre
dicted that a sympathetic strike would
be called within a week among sev
eral trades closely affiliated with the
operation of traction lines, numbering
approximately seventy thousand men.
These would include longshoremen,
powerhouse employes, teamsters and
stationary engineer and firemen, he
asserted. Action by International of
ficers of these 'organizations would be
necessary before a strike could be
called, Mr. Frayne said.
Disorder occurred at several places
and arrests were frequent. One seri
ous demonstration was broken up only
by vigorous action of police reserves.
This occurred when strikers piled cob
blestones on the track, stopping a sur
face car which they stoned. A woman
passenger was stunned when she was
knocked down by tho rush to get off
tho car. The strikers lifted the motor
man and conductor to their shoulders
and started to their hall with them,
but policemen rescued the men and
they ran the car Into tho barns.
Tho traveling public suffered more
Inconvenience than at any time alnce
tho strike started. With surface traf
fic virtually paralysed, great throngs
Bought the subway, and station plat
forms were packed. Several women
tainted in the crush.
Police Commissioner Woods ordered
an Investigation Into charges made
before the public service commission
by men who aald they were strike
breaker. Tho men declared they had
boon hold prisoners In a car barn and
were beaten by employes of a strike
breaking agency when they demanded
their pay and right to leave. Theo
dore P. Bhonto, president of the Inter
borough Rapid Transit company, de
nied that strikebreakers wore being
mistreated.
Nearly 1.000 policemen, according to
tho police department, now are en

ment Issued by the British war office.

The point at which British crossed

drawn farther in front of the Rouman
ian forces. The Roumanian attacks

ern fronts, west of the upper valleys
of the Maros and Toplitia rivers. The

WORLD NEWS
The past week marks a gain on
the part of the allies on the eastern
frontier of the war. The Russians
continue to advance toward Lem
berg, the object of their plans at
present The Austrian are de
stroying their own forts and bridges
in order to obstruct and delay the
progress. Turkish force have
come to the help of the Austrian
but ha,ve not changed the results.
On the western frontier of the
war the allies have also been meet
ing with success during the week.
The French have forced back the
Germans around Verdun and the
country in the region of the Somme
river. The gain are not large but
each little cnunt under present
condition.
The entrance of the Rumanians
into the war caused Germany to un
dertake a rapid movement against
them. With the aid of the Bulga
rian one of the Rumanian strong
hold on the line of march toward
the capital, Bucharest, has been
taken during the week but late re
port indicate that the invaders
have not been able to continue or
to bold what had been taken.
Sweden, Norway and Denmark
have prospered to such an evtent
during the war that they have been
able to pay off all their outstanding
foreign debL Thi enable them to
enter the lit of creditor nations
instead of debtor. Prosperity haa
to ome extent weakened their op
position to violations of their neu
trality. Greece ha not yet entered the
war but is on the verge of doing so.
The ministry which supported King
Conslantine in keeping out has
been forced to resign and tne more
favorable to war is in its place.
Revolution has also broken out in
the northern part of the country
and is spreading.
Japan has again made some ex
treme demands of China on account
I of outrages committed on her off
icials in Mongolia, the northern
'province of China. Like the de
mands of an earlier date fhey would
I almost give to Japan a protectorate
over China. The United States is
especially concerned in this and has
been making investigations.
The success of a humanitarian

SHARP NOTES ARE EXCHANGED.
London. There has been a further
and rather sharp exchange of notes
between Great Britain and Sweden In
regard to the difficulties brought about
by tho Entente allied blockade and
Sweden's retaliatory selsuro of malls -in
transit between England and Rus

sight. Tho British foreign secretary,
Viscount Grey, Insists that as a condi

Tho Swedish government apparently
is determined not to make such aa
engagement.
