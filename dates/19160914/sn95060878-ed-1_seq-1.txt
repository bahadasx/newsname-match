UNTRUTH
M.
HE
i GREET!
(By B. F. FLY.)
Today is the greatest feast
day ever known in Mexicali.
Governor General Esteban
Cantu has returned from his
summer . capital at Tijuana
and re-establish his headquar
ters in Mexicali, and the date
being the regular Mexican
Independence Day is to be
celebrated in true Mexican
style, with Governor General
Cantu as the central figure.
To show how the people on both
sides of the line feel towords Gover
nor Cantu, the following testimonial
has been sent me direct from Gov
ernor Cantu. It will be remembered
that the Yuma Daily Examiner is the
only paper in the United States that
has at all times been the governor's
champion, for he is the only man in
the entire republic who has at all
times maintained order in his territory
and at the same time dealt out equal
and , exact justice to all alike. It is
therefore most gratifying to know that:
the people of Calexico have at last
awakened to a realization of the fact
that Governor Cantu is their friend.
Here is the resolution of confidence
recently adopted:
Mexicali, Baja California.
Calexico, Cal., Aug. 30, 191G.
To the Governor of the Northern Dis-'
trict of Lower California, Mexico, Cal.
trict of Lower California, Mexico,
Col. Esteban Cantu:
Sir: The undersigned, residents of j
iiie iuruiern uisuict oi Liower Cali
fornia and Calexico, California, here
by extend to you a vote of friendship
and confidence as an indication of our
appreciation of the benefits which
your government provides, giving us
complete guarantees in our persons
and business and imparting all the
facilities for prosperity in this vicin
ity. This vote which we send your ex

HANLON S DAM MENACE
SHOULD BE REMOVED
(By B. F. FLY.)
The more one thinks about
the abomination at Hanlon
Heading, the more the blood
begins to boil in ones veins.
That the pile and rock dam,
stretching from bank to bank,
is a living and ever growing
menace to Yuma Valley no
man will deny who will take
the trouble to visit that abom
ination in the eyes of the
Lord. It is the greatest out
rage that has ever been perpe-trated-
on the farmers of
Yuma Valley, much greater
than the outrage perpetrated
at the same point years ago,
for the present dam but adds
to the danger of the former
dam.
When the last one was constructed
the war department made the Imperial
Valley people blow it out with dyna
mite. That only scattered the foun
dation for a space of probably several
hundred feet. The rock was not re
moved from the bed of the river. If
the same scheme is tried again it sim
ply means that for a distance of prob
ably a quarter of a mile the bed of
the river will be blanketed with rock,
which will at once preclude the pos
sibility of the river scouring at that
point to a sufficient depth to carry
away the overflow waters, which in
turn will mean that just as sure as
the sun rises so surely will the Yuma
Valley be overflowed the following
spring. The river is so silted up from
the Hanlon Heading to Yuma that
nothing on earth can prevent an over
flow, unless the Reclamation Service
raises the banks of the present levee
four or five feet above the present
grade. This, of course, will cost thou
sands upon thousands of dollars, and
unless I am badly mistaken it will all
The smart reporter on the morning
glory for three days has had the edi
tor of the Examiner and owner of the
Examiner Print Shop in jail and out
of jail, vainly seeking bondsmen for
$800, all of which he knew to the un
true, but intended to cast discredit
on a contemporary. .
If Judge Westover expects to gain
any friends or strengthen his paper by
such methods he will ultimately realize
his mistake.
Had the situation been reversed and
Editor Westover, who is also owner of
a print shop, been arrested on a tech
nicality because of a job of printing
issued from his shop and of which hi
had little or no direct knowledge, the
Examiner would not have printed in big
headlines, Westover and So and So
Jailed Both For Criminal Libel. West
over Unable to Get Bond for a Day
and a Half, etc., but instead, the item
would have been passed up with the
merest mention as of little or no news
value.
The truth so far as the Examiner
Print Shop is concerned, could have
been ascertained in a moment by call
ing up JL74 J and any reporter who
knows the first rudiments of the news
paper game and is honest enough to
practice them, will always make every
effort to ascertain the truth as it ap
pears from both sides of a case.
Judge Westover's smart reporter,
however, cares nothing for truth when
an untruth presents the most sensa
tional side. Captain O. F. Townsend
and Captain William Kryger were
signed to the the bond for W. H.
Shorey shortly after noon last Wednes
day, when the editor-owner accom
panied by Judge Robertson, appeared
before Judge Jones and waived examination.
ELLIOTT ALSO THANKFUL
(Continued on Page Two)
I desire to heartily thank all my
friends for their support in the pri
maries Tuesday. I shall do all in my
power as supervisor, if elected, to
prove to them I was worthy of their
confidence. With nothing but good
feeling for those who voted for "the
other fellow," I am with you for a com
plete victory in November.
P. E. ELLIOTT.
GRATEFUL TO FRIENDS.
From the bottom of my heart I de
sire to express my gratefulness to the
many friends who supported me on
primary day, and I shall, in the future,
as in the past, prove to them that I
fully appreciate not only their kind
ness but the full responsibilities of
the office for which I am a candidate.
I consider those who voted against me
as my friends also, and assure them
I shall always treat them as such.

PROMINENT IMPER
IAL FARM
MING 10 IUMA
A prominent Imperial Valley far
mer has written as follows:
Calexico, Cal., Sept. 13, 1916.
Yuma Board of Trade, Yuma, Ariz.
Dear Sirs: I am desirous of some
information regarding the selling price
of good farm horses, mares geldings
and mules, in and around Yuma.
I have about two carloads of stock
to sell and find that such a thing is
next to impossible here in the valley.
This stock are not cripples, nor culls
but good farm stock, sound, weigh
ing from 1050 to 1600 pounds;1 ages 4
to 11 years.
I am a farmer here in the valley,
having farmed her for nearly four
years. I have 500 acres in cotton on
the Mexican side this year.
If I could bring my stock there and,
dispose of them at a fair price I would
expect to make an investment there
in land, In as much as I do not expect
to farm another season in Imperial
Valley. Appreciating an early reply,
I am very truly yours.
The examiner omits the writer's
name, but it will be furnished to tiny
one interested.

melons were grown and contributed
by J. Ruby, one of the real wide-awake

of condition when they reach Denver.
