A Good Name is Rather to Be
Chosen Than Great Riches
The following is an outline of the ad
dress delivered by Rev. D. W. Hiott at
the dedication of the Mauldin Memorial
Home at Connie Maxwell orphanage at
Greenwood, September 2, 1916:
Solomon, the wisest man from a hu
mah standpoint-and under Divine in
spiration-made that declaration, and
it is true. How to make a good name
is to obey the word of God when it says
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
His rightousness and all these things
shall be added unto you." The man
who makes money for money's sake,
that he may hoard it or use it only for
himself, is not wise. But the man who
makes money and uses it for the good
of others is acting wisely and making a
good name.
Laban Mauldin did that. Seventy
four years ago, just on the Anderson
and Pickens county line, a little boy was
born. His father and mother were very
poor people so far as property was con
cerned. This boy with several others
had to work hard* to help support the
family. After crops were laid by he
would go to school a few weeks at a
time. In this way he learned to read,
write and, as they called it then, cipher
a little. He grew to young manhood,
went to the Confederate service and
served through the war in the famous
Hampton Legion, serving as a corporal.
After the war was over he returned to
his home and married Miss Mollie Rog
ers, who proved an helpmeet indeed to
him. They were both industrious and
economical and after many years of
earnest labor they accumulated a splen
did property. -
My acquaintance with Brother Maul
din and his wife began about 39 years
ago when they were both young. I be
came pastor of Enon church in Pickens
county where they were members.
They were good, upright people butnot
active members of the church in the
ivaf sof church work. The church haQl
go 8:/nday s'jhool at this time, and I
pers'uaded Bro. S. A. Gary and Bro.
Liaban Mauldin to undertake to carry
ort a' Sunday scho'ol at the church.
Tf ey both declared at first that they
li 4'ed too far away, but I finally per
suaded them to try it, which they did]
with wonderful success. Bro. Gary,
who was converted at 9 years of age,
was at this time fifty or fifty-five years
old. He became so aroused in the work
that at the age of 60 he was ordained
to the ministry and baptized many into
the fellowship of the churches which he
served. He baptized one young boy
who is now one of the leading preachers
in Georgia, a trustee of Mercer Uni
*versity. I refer to Rev. James F. Single
ton. Brother Mauldin was neveror
dalned to the ministry but was ordained
a deacon and was a great helper'to his
pastors. He went to nearly all of the
Union Meetings and talked on Sunday
schools and unions. He had no children
of his own but took one of his wife's
nieces and cared for hei- as his own, and
she shared in his proper'ty at his death.
In his political life he served his
county in the following offices: County
commissioner, school commissioner and
member of the legislature, and in all
he was faithful.
When the orphanage whs founded-.
24 years ago--ho at once began to t e
an interest in it, He gave liberally to
Its suppor~ HVaas elected' a trtjste
of the COnnie M'twell orphanage 'ed
was a trustee et the time of his desith.

He was for 9 years moderator of the
Piedmont Association.
Many times in conversation with him
during the later years of his life he
told me that after he had prayed over
it and thought over it he had decided to
put his money into this Memorial Home
In memory of his beloved wife.
Why do we build monuments? Ser
geant Jasper's monument is built in
memory of a heroic deed. The Confed
erate monument is built in memory of
the fallen dead. This home will stand
ndefinitely and another one .will be
3rected and so it will go on, providing
shelter for the homeless for all time to
,ome, in memory of a loving wife.
Connie Maxwell orphanage has its
name and a large part of its property
in memory of a beloved daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. Maxwell.
Mrs. Hetty Green, the richest woman
In this country, lost all her property be
eause it was not invested for the Lord
ror humanity.
Laban Mauldin saved'his property be
!ause it was wisely invested for the
Lord and helpless orphan children.
He sought the Lord in childhood
He served Him when a youth.
He loved the Lord in manhood
He served Him in the truth.
He loved the Lord in old age
And when his hair turned gray
He gave the Lord all that he had
And closed his eyes on earthly scenes
And opened them in Heaven.
After the above address was deliver
?d the dedication prayer was offered by
Rev. H. K. Williams of Easley.
The following visitors attended from
.he Piedmont Association of which Mr.
Wauldin was a member: Rev. H. K.
Williams, Dr. W. R. Wyatt, Laban
Rogers, Walter Evatt and two little
laughters, Lois and Rosebud, Dr. and

N. B., M. B. Roe of Pickens county;
Mrs. Laura Durham of Georgia and a
Mrs. Mary Jane Durham, of Pickens bi
county. F
Now all her toil is over and earth's lead M
cross laid down,
For love hath called her home and love la
bestows a crown. M
No more in the dark or gloom of earth's y
fleet years
Will she tread any vale of woe or sit B
in tears,
No more she suffers now
No more finds pain in life
NQ more is sickness hers
No more she meets with strife, s
No darkness shall she know,
She dwells where is no night; n
No storm will come up there; n
14o frosts the flowers blight;
No sin will scar the heart, a
No sorrow grip the soul; c
No more life's lived in part, but in the
perfect whole,
When deep within the casket sleeping B
Was seen tht mother so old in years, w
0 many friends their vigil keeping, m
Did weep their unavailing tears,
And oft we knelt among the flowers to
A tribute to their taken mother.
The loss was theirs but also ours, hc
For she was cleansed and undefiled. te
To her children's voice she hearkened, ,of
And she worked her husband's will si:
Until the great Death Angel darkened to
Up the door with "Peace be still." w;
And mother needed no warning, in
For she was good enough to go, g(
From earth's bleak night to Heaven's
morning, and there in grace and
beauty grow,
Yes, there grow in grace and beauty,
And strength and wisdomn-thento wvait A
Until all done our earthly duty, s
We shall greet her at the gate. lo
It was not gloom or night for her to go H
away, b
For death to her was leaving night and ci
meeting day.
She left a home on earth to dwell in bi
mansions fair,and in that home ge
There is no need of sin to shine, c
For Christ's own face doth light the g
place with light divine.
She left a world of pain for land by
comfort blest,F
And we'll meet her all perfection andF

So sleep on, mother, in your sacred
casket
Until your body's brought above
By our Savior who'll unmask it.
There in the happy land of love,
At rest with lilies on thy breast,
Beneath the sweet and silent sod,.f
So free from battle strife f
And meagre joys of life, H
Now folded in the peace of God. ti
So sleep on in thy sacred casket,

In Memory of W. C. Garrett
luka (Miss.) Newspaper.
On Wednesday, August 9, just after
noon, the sad news flashed over the
country that W. C. Garrett was drowned
in Tennessee river, near Eastport land
ing, where he lived This news came
as a great shock to his family, relatives
and many friends.
Mr. Garrett came toTishomirgo county
about two and a half years ago from
Norris. S. C., and had been engaged in
farming on the river.
At the time of the sad accident which
a
caused his death he was out in the river
in a boat gathering mussels, when by
some chance, we know not how, the
boat turned over and he began swim
ming for the shore and crying for help,
but when within a short distance of the
shore and before help could reach him
he sank to rise no more.
While Mr. Garrett had only been in
our midst a short while he hadl made
many friends, as everyone who chanced
to know him loved him. He was a
christain, a good citizen, a goodl neigh
bor, and was always ready and willing
to help in a good cause.
His body was brought to luka
and was sent to Norris, S. C., for
burial. Mr. Garrett leaves a wife and
two hildenfather and mother, broth
ers and sisters and a host of friends to
niourn their loss.
May the Infinite Father of us all heal
the broken hearts of the bereaved.

From Mr. Tillman
Mr. Editor: I ask for space in your
.olumns to thank those who supported
ne for Congress in the recent primary,
,go man appreciates more than I do the
mupport which was so freely given in
that contest. I think I might be par
doned in calling to the attention of those
who voted for me as a source of pride
in their vote the results as shown by
the ballots of my home people. Edge
field county is my native county, where
I was born and raised, and in the Edge
leld part of McCormick county I re
!eived 327 votes to my opponents' 147.
n Greenwood city, my home, I receiv
d 630 votes to a combined vote against
ne of 335, and in Greenwood county
received 1458 votes t6 a combined vote
,gainst me of 1514. When it is remem
ered that this is Congressman Aiken's
Id home I feel justifiable pride in the
bove figures.
There is no - sting in defeat when it
arries with it the testimony of the re
ard and esteem of one's neighbors and
ihatever may be my future in politics
will never receive a vote that I will
ppreciate more than I appreciate the
otes given me last Tuesday, and I hope
hat I will never do anything in the
uture to cause any man to regret the
ote he cast for me then. I made my
anmpaign on issues vital to the people
nid sought to enlighten and elevate the
udiences to wich I spoke. Every man
vho runs a race wants to win and I
vas no exception to the rule, but in
iguring the summer's, work I have no
egrets. I ran a clean race in a clean
vay and t~he consciousness of It is worth
nore than a victory unvvorthily won.
Respectfully,
. - H. C. TILLMAN.
From Mr. Craig
Please allow me to thank my good
riends, many of whom I do not know,
'or their support in the recent election.
Mhile I was defeated I respect myself
md the things for which I stood andam
n no way dispirited over my failure. I
eel that the cause of education needs
;he things for which I stood as bad
is I need the office; and since it was
mpossible for me to canvass the county
md place my views before the people I
willl. in all probability be a candidate
our years hence.
I don't want to die whipped. I feel
Ike 'the poet who said:
"He who fights and runs away,
Shall live to fight another day;
But he who in battle is slain
Shall ne'er renew the fight again."
Respectfully, C. L. CnAIG.
Pickens, S. C. Sept. 11, 1916.
From Mr Dagnall
As it will be impossible for me to see
and thank personally each voter, I take
this method of expressing my apptecia
tion to those who so I".-ally supported
me in my race for congress, and I shall
always be grateful to those who consid
ered me worthy of representing the
district in congress. A. H. DAGNALE.
