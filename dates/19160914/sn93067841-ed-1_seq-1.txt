A VICTORY FOR LAW
DECLARESMANNK
STATE NOMINEE SAYS HE CONSECRATES
HIMSELF ANEW TO
WORK OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
Columbia, September 12:?Reiterating
his policy of law enforcement,
stressing the supremacy of the
constitution and appealing to the
thousands who heard him to burj
past differences and live together ir
a spirit of brotherhood for the good
of South Carolina, Governor Richard
I Manning at the call of a multitude,
delivered a patriotic address
from the portico of the State Capitol
shortly after eleven o'clock tonight.
When it was seen that Gov Manning
had been renominated by t
comfortable majority the thousands
of cheering South Carolinias watching
the returns, headed by the Harvest
Jubilee Band, marched to the
State House and loudly called foi
the Chief Executive. It was difficult
to hear the Governor's words
as crashing cheer after cheer wellec
upward from joyous throats. Since
early afternoon a crowd numbering
hundreds of persons and gradually
growing into thousands, throngec
the streets.
^ ^ Anxiety soon gave place to joy
K when it was seen the majority ol
W Governor Manning, gained early ir
the evening, continued undiminished
When it was realized that Governoi
Manning was renominated, joy
reigned unbounded, and as county
after county showed in the Manning
column unrestrained cheers crashec
into the night air.
After Governor Manning's majori
ty was assured hundreds of Man
ning and Cooper men, many o1
whom were accompanied by theii
wives and sweethearts, went mt<
m the executive chamber and shool
hands with the Chief Executive
Throughout the night Governoi
Manning received hundreds of tele
grams and telephone calls congratu
lating him on his renomination
many of the wires being from dis
tant States.
Shortly before midnight Governoi
Manning sent the following tele
gram to Robert A Cooper, of Lau
rens: "Permit me to express mj
profound gratitude for the supporl
of you and your friends."
When the returns began coming
in tonight it was early seen that th<
Cooper people had lined up solid foi
\ Governor many and that the deflec
tion to Mr Blease predicted by Blease
leaders did not materialize and Man
ning men tonight were enthusiastic
in their praise of the Laurens mar
and his followers.
The following short speech was

delivered by Governor Manning to-!
night and he put heartfelt feeling
in its deliverance:
i "The returns indicate a victory
for the constitution and law. At?
such a time a sense of profound
1 gratitude to Almighty God fills our
' hearts. I have never seen a time
* when the people of South Carolina:
. were more stirred over an elect%n.
' It is a victory of the people in sup- j
port of the consititution and the en
r forcement of law.
? "It shows that when the people.
I realize their duty and when a real!
danger, a crisis, confronts them, J
- they meet it as true patriots and
settle it aright. Splendid work has
been done by the citizens and their
work has been rewarded by success.
If this victory is assured, and I be
lieve it is assured, we must see that
i bitterness and strife are subdued:
> and allayed and that we must all as I
citizens of one State and as breth-1
j
ren in a common cause unite in the j
' great work of upbuilding our State i
' and in making higher and better I
?ho rasters nf nnr citizens.
> "I consecrate myself anew to this
I great work and pledge myself to j
i your service." i

' The second allotment of flood re- \
1 lief funds, requested of the war de-!
partment for this State some time
p
ago, has been received and will be
7 ready for distribution as soon as re7
ports from the counties arrive,
j Previously letters were sent to the
various counties in the State asking
that they send reports relative to
employment. This was done for
* the purpose of equalizing the funds
among the counties, and no funds of
r the second allotment will be sent
* out until the United States army|
c engineer, Major G A Youngberg, |
" knows of what money is needed in
r each county.
? Pay rolls are coming into the engineer's
office, .but some are not
9
. made up as well as they might be.
A circular will be sent 'o the local!
r authorities in each county in charge
. of the flood relief work, instructing
. them in the way pay rolls should be
, made up and sent. One part of the
I circular says: "All pay rolls covered
by Federal funds must be accurate,
r complete and in such condition that
, they will pass the auditor, for the
. war department, of the treasury department."
The end of the circular
, states that everything in it "must
be complied with. Otherwise pay
. rolls cannot be honored, and payk
ment will be delayed till errors have
been corrected."?Tuesdays'$ Atws
