MILLION DOLLAR
HOTEL FOR CITY
IS NOW ASSURED
Formal Organization of Com
pany Expected to Be Effected
at Dinner Tonight
THIRD AND WALNUT SITE
Chamber of Commerce Com
mittee Spends Weeks of Hard
Work Shaping Project
After years t>f waiting, Harrisburg
is to have Its modern and in every
•way up-to-date hotel. Tentative plans
for a $1,000,000 hostelry have been
under consideration for several weeks,
but only recently the movement took
form and substance. It may now be
said with entire authority and confi
dence that the period of waiting is at
an end and the city will no longer need
to apologize for the absence of a first
class hotel.
Early in the year E. Z. Wallower,
one of the most successful of the city's
businessmen, was induced to head the
special Chamber of Commerce com
mittee which has had the mattsr in
■charge. Backing Mr. Wallower at
every step has been a group of active,
public-spirited men, who are about to
see the successful culmination of their
labors. Mr. Wallower has invited the
officials of the Chamber of Commerce
and those who have already indicated
in a practical way their co-operation
to have dinner with him this evening
at the Harrisburg Club. At this din
ner it is expected the formal organi
zation of the hotel company, the elec
tion of directors and the authorization
of other details will take place.
Option on Opera House Site
It is commonly reported that those
In charge of the movement have an
option upon the old Opera House cor
ner at Third and Walnut streets, this |
property having been approved by
hotel experts as ideal in its topograph
ical features and location. Other
sites are said to have been considered,
but the corner of Third and Walnut
streets was finally agreed upon as most
desirable in every way.
There seems to be no concealment of
the fact that enough subscriptions
have already been promised to Mr.
Wallower ind his committee to assure
a successful undertaking, but the pub
lic generally will bo invited to join In
the project so that It may be in every
way a local enterprise.
Now Assured
No details were obtainable to-day
owing to the fact that the committee
in charge believed it was not wise to
discuss these matters until after the
meeting to-night. What will most con
cern the people of Harrisburg, however,
is that the hotel is assured and that
back of it are many of our most rep
resentative citizens.
1 HILL HOUSES ROBBED
Thieves last night raided four
houses in the vicinity of Sixteenth and
North streets, making away with a
largo supply of groceries and a small
amount of money. Three of the places
entered and reported to the police
follow: Home of B. A. Daniel, 1512
North street; Robert S. Bowman. 617
North Fifteenth street, and F. M. Hun
ter, 621 North Fifteenth street. One
other place was entered, but no one
was at home, and no particulars could
be learned. It is the belief of city
police that some one is making the
raids to lay in a supply of provisions
for the winter.

Extraordinary Rise in
Stocks Unequaled Since
Movement in War Brides
New Tork, Sept. 14. The extra
ordinary rise in the stock market of
the last fortnight, unequaled since
last year's movement in war brides,
attained wider and more impressive
proportions to-day, the first hour's
trading of almost half a million shares
being attended by gains of 1 to 3
points in Industrials, Equipments,
Motors, Oils and shares of almost
every other description, with a twenty
point advance in Bethlehem Steel at
5 75.
United States Steel was the chief
feature rising to 106% in the first
hour and exceeding its previous rec
ord by % of a point.
Demand for Studebaker, Industrial
Alcohol, Lackawanna Steel, Baldwin
Locomotive, New York Air Brake,
Mexican Petroleum and related issues
carried those stocks 2 to 5 points above
yesterday's final prices.
Rails were relatively inconspicuous,
although Reading, Union Pacific, and
New Haven were higher by one to
two and a half points. Realizing sales,
or profit taking, was in such enormous
volume during the forenoon as to ef
fect reversals of one to two points
from best prices of the opening. This
was offset, however, by fresh buying
power, much of which seemed to
originate from out-of-town sources.
Arrested on Charge
of Looting Bank of
$271,000 Years Ago
Chicago, Sept. 14. Martin H.
Flannigan, a saloon-keeper was ar
rested here to-day in connection with
the robbery five years ago of the
branch of the Bank of Montreal at
New Westminster, B. C. Loot amount
ing to $271,000 was obtained by the
robbers. The arrest of Flannigan was
made as a result of the arrest in
Toronto, yesterday, of Michael B.
Shortall, a marble worker of Chicago,
who was attempting to pry open a
safety deposit vault in the vault of the
Bank of Toronto.
The box, rented by Flannigan four
years ago, was found to be stuffed
with Canadian bank notes. Shortall
told the Toronto police he had been
employed by Flannigan to make the
trip to Toronto and was being paid $5
a day for his service.
Flannigan, the police say. is the
same man arrested three years ago on
a charge of having in his possession
stolen Westminster bank notes. He
escaped conviction as the numbers on
the notes did not correspond with
those stolen from the British Columbia
bank.

REGULAR SERVICE
BEING RESTORED
Maintain Subway and Elevated
Schedules in N. Y.; Far From
Being Defeated, Strikers Say
New York, Sept. 14. Despite the
maintenance of regular schedules on
the subway and elevated lines of the
Interborough Rapid Transit Company
and the gradual transportation of ser
vice on the surface lines, leaders of the
striking street railway employes de
clared to-day they were far from be
ing defeated. They hinted that the
danger of a "sympathetic" strike is
not yet over.
Following a parade and demonstra
tion by the strikers, the question of a
"sympathetic" strike will be discussed
at meetings of the Central Federated
Unions of Brooklyn and Manhattan.
Strike leaders predict that resolutions
favoring a strike among trades allied
with the street railway employes will
be adopted. Whether the strike will
actually take place, however, will de
pend on the individual votes of the
union, it is asserted.
Traction officials announced to-day
that service in the subway and on the
elevated roads was better than normal,
while service on most of the street car
lines was from 25 to 40 per cent, be
low normal. The railway companies
say it is no longer necessary for them
to hire strike breakers, claiming that
hundreds of their former employes
have returned to work.
Five trolley cars came together in
a series of rear-end collisions in West
Chester avenue in the Bronx to-day
and ten passengers were injured, one
seriously. The accidents occurred at
the foot of a steep incline and the car
crews, who said they were strike
breakers, claimed the rails had been
greased so that the brakes would not
hold.

emergency arises it make connection
with the Harrisburg city mains to se
cure a supply. This agreement, it is
charged, has not been carried out.

of Setting Match to Oil-

DRIVES OUT FAMILY
Neighbors Phone Police, but
Blaze Is Started Before
They Arrive
After ordering his wife and daugh
ter from their home this morning,
I James Gillen, 925 Grand street, piled
( up broken furniture, saturated it with
kerosene, and fired it. This is the be
, lief of Fire Chief John C. Kindler, who
j investigated the blaze at the Grand
jstreet house, which caused about S2OO
! damage, and for a time threatened
! several frame houses in the row.
j Miss Winifred Gillen, daughter of
| the man, who is now under arrest
pending an investigation, told the
police after the fire, that her father
came home intoxicated shortly after
6 o'clock this morning and ordered
her and her mother to leave the
house. He threatened to set fire to
the place then, according to the
young girl's story.
Neighbors took Miss'Gillen and her
mother into their homes .and N. Har
ris, 923 Grand street, 'phoned to the
1 police department before the fire
j started, telling them of Glllen's actions
and threats.
Shortly after Mr. Harris saw smoke
pouring from the Gillen home and
rushed to Sixth and Forster streets
to send in an alarm. Before the ar
rival of the fire apparatus, the officers
had entered the house and taken Gil
len to heedquarters.
The blaze was confined to the Gil
len home, after it was extinguished
Fire Chief Kindler Investigated and
found charred pieces of broken furni
ture in the stairway, and a broken
kerosene lamp. Coupling this evi
dence with the stories of Miss Gillen
and neighbors of Gillen's threats, the
city fire chief called at the State Fire
Marshal's department and reported
the case to them. An investigation
has started and a charge of incendiar
ism may be brought against Gillen.
