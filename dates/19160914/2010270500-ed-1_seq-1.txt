Sioux City Journal, 10th: Miss
Martraret O'Neill, of Jackson, Neb.,
and Miss Linda Winter, of Norfolk,
Neb., teachers in the Joy school,
arrived yesterday. They will live at

that the Union Pacific Railway com
pany has been the real purchaser of
the combination bridge and that the
Northern Trust company, of Phila
delphia, has acted as its agent in its
acquirement, is held by many of the
business men of Sioux City and
Omaha who for years have been
aware of the desire of the company
to train entrance into Sioux City.
Two reasons are advanced forgiving
credence to the report. It is a
widely known fact that several of
the high oflicials of the Union Paci
fic road are members of the board
of directors of the Northern Trust
company, and it also is known that
the Philadelphia company in the
past has acted as financial agent of
the road in deals of a similar char
acter. In addition to the. signifi
cance of these facts it is stated that
the engineers who for the last four
months have been makeng surveys
of the territory between Norfolk,
Neb., and South Sioux City, belong
to the engineering corps of the Uniorj
Pacific. The nearest point to Sioux
.Citv touched by the main line of the
Union Pacific is Norfolk, Neb., but
whether the extension of the system
would come from that city or some
other point along the line is not
known. In the last fifteen years
there have been many reports of
the plans of the. Union Pacific to
tap this section of the country, and
in 1904 olhcials or the company ad
mitted that plans were being con
sidered with that end in view. It
was at that time the men identified
with the ownership and manage
ment of the Combination Bridge
company purchased property lying
between the old union statiom at
Third and Douglas streets and the
approach to the bridge, in order to
make it possible for a railroad to es
tablish a right of way to and from
the bridge. The company which ac
quired this strip was the Railroad
Bridge and Terminal company, and
the ' deeds for the property which
was purchased were filed in the office
of the county recorder on November
2G, 1904. There has been no change
in the title to this property since
that time, so that means of getting
a Sioux City terminal still is open to
the Union Pacific. Bridges which
span the Missouri and Mississippi
rivers are rarely owned directly by
the railroad companies which use
them. This is true of the high
bridge at Sioux City which is used
by the Omaha road. The ownership
of this bridge is vested in another
company, .vith which the officials
of the Omaha and Northwestern
lines are connected. W. L, Selby,
the Omaha broker who purchased
the combination bridge for the
Northern Trust company, who was
in Sioux City Friday did not deny
that the bridge eventually will bo
used by a railroad, but intimated
that such a step will follow in the
future.

County Agent's Field Notes
BY A. II. HECKHOlV.
MCTUODS IN HOG FEEDING
Quite a good deal of interest is
being manifested in various meth
ods of hog feeding, with especial
reference to the hogging down corn
in the field.
The question of economy in feed
ing with good consistent gains is
very important especially when one
considers that with the prices which
obtain at the present a few pounds
more or less is likely to make quite
a little difference at the end of the
period. To this end, let me ask
that those of you who have scales
arrange for some tests in the cost
of production and any other factors
which might be 6f importance be
tween now and the time of market
ing. I shall be glad to arrange any
such tests, help weigh them up and
to keep the records.
Thus far, four herds have already
been started and two more will be
as soon as the corn is ready. Mr.
Dave Woods is starting ISO head of
spring shoats in the corn field, with
free run of alfalfa pasture supple
mented with shorts slop in feed lot.
Hogs weighed 55 pounds.
John Feller is starting 235 head of
shoats with free run of pasture but
with corn and oats fed in dry lot.
Barley added later. These hogs
weighed 56 pounds. At the time
for turning in to the corn, they will
be weighed again and a record kept
of the feed fed.
E. J. Way has weighed up 53 old
sows and turned into corn and al
falfa, but nosupplementery feed and
2G0 head of spring shoats averaging
75 pounds, in same fields but with a
ration ot 2 parts tankage and 5
shorts in form of slop in addition.
lrank Way has a similar test with
85 spring shoats, average G3 pounds,
in corn with free run of alfalfa, sup
plemented with slop shorts, tankage
and milk.
These hogs will all be weighed
from time to time and will give us
some interesting figures on this
form of feeding.
I find some people who are much
opposed to hogging down corn, who
consider it wasteful. Tests as these,
with actual determination of yield
of corn, and the same checked
against dry lot herds, will give somo
very close data, if not exact.
Watch for the gain and cost of
gain on these and other lots at the
close of the first weighing period.
No new cases of cholera have
come to my attention, but I have
been called to vaccinate the herd of
Sam Lauritson, as a protection, for
he has had cholera on the place for
several years past.
Several new hog houses are being
built this fall, mostly of concrete.
Let mo urge in this, that in the pens
and floors, you provide a few inches
slope for drainage, so they can bo
flushed, and when you put in foun
dations, put in one for the scales too
so as to make pen and chute ar
rangements most convenient for
weighing and loading.
President Wilson will not inuko any
speaking dates, wo nro told, but only
separate engagements for addresses,

Not Enthusiastic for, Dan
Commenting on the lack of inter
est the democratic voters of this
district are guilty of in the matter
of the candidacy of Dan V. Stephens
for congress, the Teknmah Journal
remarks:
"It is interesting to note the lnck
of interest even among democrats in
the success of Comgressman Dan V.
Stephens in the coming election.
Mr. Stephens has won the reputa
tion whether deserving or not, of
being a public official who wants to
carry water on both shoulders. Ho
wants to so movo that he will corral
every kind of a vote and ho talks
accordingly. The result is he is dis
trusted by all classes of voters. The
fellow who is an ardent democrat
doesn't know what minute this dem
ocratic congressnjan may bolt the
work of the national administration
and the luke warm democrat sees
nothing in Mr. Stephens to admire
from a party standpoint. Being
mainly desirous of again being voted
into i ce he blows hot and cold on
all piii iic questions. He is for pro
pane, i.i s and then again he is
against that idea. He thinks the
president has gone too far in his
friendliness for the Allies and then
in other sections of the district
he thinks the president should
make John Bull walk chalk. He is
a sauve politician and his constitu
ents are tired of having a represen
tative in congress who is accom
plishing nothing beyond a burden
ing of the mail with franked com
munications asking for a continua
tion of his do-nothing work in con
gress. The time for a change has
come and the voters of the Third dis
trict are awake to that fact.
