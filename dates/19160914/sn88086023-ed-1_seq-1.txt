Judge Fee denounced the county
court vehemently for repudiating its
solemn contract with the library board
and for what he characterized as an
attempt to take over the Pendleton
city library without the consent of the
people of Pendleton He, moreover,
delivered an Invective against the
present librarian, putting upon her the
responsibility of the present library
turmoil and charging her with repeat
edly assuming authority that was not
vested In her. As an example of her
alleged arbitrary actions, he delared
that, without any authority whatever
from the Pendleton public library
board, she had. under cover of dark
ness and by way of back streets, mov
ed the city library into a county
building.
For this Judge Fee suggested that
action for damages be brought against
the county or against Miss Nason.

Following the rciucft of City Attor
ney J. Alger Fee for the city that all
poles now maintained on Main street
be removed, a report from the office
of the , district commercial superin
tendent of the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company was filed with th"
city recorder last night. The report is
as follows:
"In connection with this matter and
in way of information. 1 will state
that we have under way and have
been engaged for the past year in
preparing a complete engineering
study for the reconstruction of our
telephone plant In the city of Pen
dleton. During the year 1915 we
completed work which covered the
complete reconstruction of the tele
phone plant In the section north ot
the Umatilla river and now have in
preparation an estimate in the am-
ount of $16,000 to cover the com
plete reconstruction in the section
south of the Umatilla river and north
of the Oregon-Washington railroad
tracks and which provides for the
elimination of all pules on Main
street from Railroad avenue north.
"The development on the south
side of the O.-W. railroad tracks Is
not sufficient to warrant underground
construction, for which reason we de
sire to retain the present pole lead
on the main street from Railroad
avenue south across the railroad
tracks, and we are hopeful that the
city council will be favorable to the
continuation of our poles along this
portion of the main street for the
reason stated.
"We shall be pleased to discuss the
entire matter with the city council
or its representatives at some future
date, if desired
"We feel that when our proposed
plans for the reconstruction of our
Plant are completed that conditions
will
be entirely
satisfactory' to the
