British and French Draw Net Tight About Combles and Have
Stronghold Two-Thirds Surrounded Germans Bring,
i 20,000 From Verdun and Fight Desperately to Save
J Peronne-Serbians Take Bulgar Trenches and Capture
Heights-Deadlock On Russian Front
J By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, -Sept. 14. The British have joined with the
French in the new eastward drive to squeeze the Germans
out of Combles and Perbnne and made progress last night
north of Ginchy.
The British gain, officially reported by General Haig,
draws a noose tighter around Combles whose outskirts
are now held by the French. On the eastern side of
Combles, the French have pushed forward in this week's
fighting until the town is about two-thirds surrounded.
The Germans are counter attacking desperately to
save Peronne. The French war office today announced
that more German troops have been transferred from the
Verdun front and that twenty thousand Germans from
Verdun led the German attack on the Combles-Peronne
line yesterday. The German war office announced this
afternoon that the Teuton counter attacks have met with
some success and that all Anglo-French atta'cks last night
were repulsed.
As if in answer to the German claim that the allied
offensive in northern Greece has been stopped the French
war office this afternoon announced further gains by the
Serbs on the allies' right wing. The Serbians captured
a row of Bulgarian trenches and pushed the Bulgars from
a dominating height. On the remainder of the Mace
donia f rout only artillery duels and minor patrol activities
were reported by the French and British war offices". .
The deadlock on the Russian front and in southeast
ern Rumania continues. The Russian war office an
nounced the repulse of German-Bulgarian attacks east of
the fort of Silistra. t i " ! i , . i :
The GpTman war office officially con
firmed reports that the Bulgarians
have occupied the Greek port of Kavala
and announced that the,German-Bulgar
rffimpaijjii in southeastern Rumania in
Irogressing. The repulse of allied at
tacks at several points on the Macedon
ian frontier was announced at Berlin.
The Tact that Berlin saw fit to an
nounce the occupation of Kavala was in
terpreted here as meaning that the Ger
mans no longer hope to keep Greece-out
of the war. The German minister at
Athens is reported to have assured King
i'nnatnntiue several weeks ago that
Kavala would not be occupied by the
HiilgBi'H so long as Greece continued
ii rut nil.
French Gains Comamnd Roads.

roads entering from the east.
Take Troops From Verdun.
Paris, Sept. 14. The Germans have
shifted more troops from Verdun to the
Nomine front in an effort to check Gen
eral Foch's forces closing in upon Pe
ronne. The war office announced today that
yesterday's ine'fefctive counter attack
nuaiiiHt the .southern extremity of Hill
7(. northwest of Peronne, was led by
a fresh German division hastily trans
ferred from Verdun. The Germans made
several more attacks at the same point
last night, but were completely re
pulsed. South of the Somnic, the Germans at
tacked at several different points, but
were repulsed. West of C'haiiliies one
German company was caught under
French fire and practically annihilated.

No new business came to light yes

while clusters are worth about a cents.
The greater premium on toggles this
year is due to the stoppage of nil im
portations from Germany, as bsewera

is this same condition that has caused
New York slnte hops to advance so

high as ;I7 cents for the new crop.

Headed bv a band furnished bv the

from 80th street and Park nvenue to

held this afternoon. About 3,000 of the
strikers were in uniforms. Police esti

men and women screaming and shouting
for help. The cars dashed down nt
such speed they dure not jump. When
the first car stopped nt the bottom, the
four coming up behind, crashed into it.
The strikebreakers said the brakes on
the car refused to work. They also claim
the tracks had been greased during the
night.

BRIDGES AND TUNNELS
IMPORTANT FEATURE
Inland Sites Make Most of
"Safety First" Argument
Against Coast Towns
By J. P. Toder
(United Press staff correspondent) ;
Washington, Sept.- 14. Four naval
authorities today umpired the liveliest
land battle they ever saw, the $11,000,
000 prize contest for the government
armor plate plant site. Six score and a
few odd cities are participating. Each
contesting city has all the advantage
needed for any first class armor plat
factory and according to her earnest or
ators, has them to a degree not equalled
by any other.
The naval authorities, Secretary Dan-
iels, Assistant Secretary Roosevelt, Ad
miral Benson and Rear Admiral Strauss,
heard arguments yesterday of the cities
in Btates that began with Alabama and
continued alphabetically now to Rhode
Inland. Today Providence, R. I., onen
ed the argument. Tenuessee, Texas, Vir
ginia and West- Virginia cities were
to bo heard before dark. -.
The cheapest fuel, the best transpor-.
tation, the most accessible deposits of
ore, the highest class of labor and the
beat working conditions were common
attributes' of all the cities represented.
Some threw in the finest climate far
good measure. j
The' naval men are giving, serious on- ,
sideration to all the points made. Thev
have to balance against tho advantage
of deep water harbor on the eoast, the
danger of attack by -a foreign enemy
and the, Inland cities nrntora are niak- .
ing the most of this. With this element
of danger removed it Is gcnerallv agreed
the const cities competing for the plant
would have all the advantage. '
Ono instance of real team play de
veloped today. Bristol, Tennesson, wants
the plant. So does Bristol, Virginia.
If the Virginia Bristol loses, her hone
is that the Tennessee Bristol wins. The,
only division between them is the state
line, the two cities being prettv much
the same pluce, except for that imngin-
nry line.
Many Points Involved.
Washington, Sept. 14. With conclu
sion of arguments by representative
or VZ.i cities thnt want the govern
ment armor plato plnnt expected to
night or tomorrow, the navy general
board hns decided to visit a majority
Df tho sites proposed.
Some of tho cities in the proposition,
it was stated, will necesnurily have to
be abandoned at tho start, becuuso
sites suggested do not come within that
section of the law which provides thnt
the plant must bo lorntcd "with spe
cial reference to safety In time of
war." That seciton, all members of
the general board questioned today said
will be the principal issue involved in
the lointion of tho plant that will mean
employment to mnity thousands of men
and a payroll of many hundred thous
ands. Uther Important considerations, such
as availability of raw materiul, trans
portation facilities, etc., will be waived
if necessary to meet the provision.
The I'liited Press learned today from,
an authoritative source that the fol
lowing big factors must be considered
in deciding on a location:
Cost of land for site.
Availibility of raw material.
Condition of lubor market.
Transportation facilities, with the
mutter of bridges to be crossed or.
tunnels ou tho lines to ship building
plants, is a factor of first importance.
