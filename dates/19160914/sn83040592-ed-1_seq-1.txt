EYE SIGHT
IT IS SURPRISING tht inch o Im
portant natter u good eyesight should so
often lack the attention it requires.
Statistics prove that about 75 per cent of
the population suffer from some form of
defective sight. Many persons have
light difference in the power of the eyes,
thns causing a constant strain which
rapidly increases the defect unless relief
be obtained. Consult V. H. Barnes,
Doctor of Optics, when he is in Baxter

Ore Field West of Baxter
Continues to Show up
Fine New Shaft
The Kaniurit Mining company
is linking a abaft on the Pross
Chubb property, on the Kansas
aide one mile weat of the Mound.
Two shifta are (at work and
Saturday night they were down
25 or 30 feet, The shaft is 5x8
feet in the clear and it is expected
that ore will be encountered at
about 255 feet. This it is esti
mated will take about ten weeks.
The original lease on this
property is held by a. v.
Skelton of Miami. He put down
several holes and got rich ore in
every one, ore running 18 per
cent or better with an average
face of 18 feet. The operators
are pleased with the prospect of
having little trouble with water.
When the last prospecting was
done the water stood in the holes
at 110 feet, it is now down 170
feet and it is thought the Picher
people are pumping it off. A
lime bar is also expected to make
an effectual water shed.
Besides the work on the new
shaft the Kansuria company have
already installed the boiler and
they expect to have their mill
erected and have the mine in the
shipping list close to the first of
the year. This propetty lies just
six miles west of Baxter Springs.
Out on the Hocker property
drillers have made another fine
strike in a hole 150 feet apart
from those previously sunk. On
both forties of the Hocker lease
milling propositions are now
practically a certainty.
J. W. Barnes at present is
operating a dozen or more drills
west of Baxter all within three
and a half miles of the city. It
is currently reported that almost
every hole is showing up well.
The territory has all the appear
an'ces of a live mining camp.
Drills are working at present on
the lands of R. C. Thomas, Neal
Clark, Frank, Will and Jim
Hartley and Mrs. D. S- Chubb.
Unless low prices demoralize the
ore market completely, and that
is not probable, next year will
bring great activity in this
locality and Baxter Springs will
flourish. '

School Notes.
The Junior class of the Baxter
Springs High school is going to
have a weiner roast tomorrow
night at the mouth of Spring
river.
The Baxter High school re
cently purchased a CoraJ piano
from J. W. Grantham. It is just
what has been needed for a long
time and will help cheer up the
room when the students get sad
and sober from over study.
Now that the high school de
partment has a new piano the
old organ that has ' been in use
for many years has been taken to
the primary room.
Eight high school pupils and
six grade pupils are taking ad
vantage of the opportunity for
rural folks to attend Baxter
schools by paying a small amount
for tuition. ,
On account of the crowded con
dition of the ' Baxter schools the
Baxter people might as well know
that they will soon have to build
a new school to accommodate the
pupils There are not desks
enough ' in. the high school de
partment and in many( of the
lower grades the conditions are
the same.
Miss Juanita Hash returned to
school Monday. Miss Hash has
been on a visit for the last few
weeks. This is another pupil for
the seniors.
Miss Nellie Moore is attending
schools in the ninth grade. Miss
Moore is a rural student.

be the new Presbyterian preacher
in this city. The Browns are
staying at the Plum home.

Returns After Many Years. 4
' Edward A. Brewster, of Tell
uride, Colo., was in Baxter for a
few days the past week visiting
the family of his brother, L. D.
Brewster. He was one of the
pioneer citizens of the town,
leaving here back in the early
80's, since which time until now
he had not seen the place. Mr.
BrewSter saw many changes of
course yet he said that many of
the old landmarks are left, and a
few of the early settlers with
who he visited with a great deal
of pleasure all around.
To The Tax Payers.
Many of my old patrons have
asked if I was going to handle
ihe tax books this year. With
my present position it will be
impossible for me to handle
them, but Mr. Tarrence Connor
will open the books in The State
Bank. Thanking you for past
favors, and assuring you that you
will receive the same attention
you have in the past, xou can
pay at the same old place in the:
same old way. Reipy I

RAILROAD
EXTENSION
M. O. & C. Railway to Build
North to Junction with
the Katy Line to
Galena.
The Missouri, Oklahoma &
Gulf Railroad will extend its line
from this point north for a dist
ance of about six mil's to a junc
tion with the Missouri, Kansas
& Texas Railroad at Mineral
station. Grade stakes have been
set .for this extension and it is
the understanding that the line
will be finished and trains oper
ated thereon by the first of the
year.
Different rumors of railroad
building through Baxter Springs
have been floating around for a
number of months. Some of
these reports are more than
rumors in Jtct and the time is
not far away the News is sure,
when we, shall have an interbur
ban lin between here and the
mining district to the south and
west.
But the proposed extension of
the M. O. & G. is a certainty.
Work will be started right away
Woman's Strategy Wins.
Baxter women, if there are any
who experience difficulty in per
suading their husbands to come
across with funds for their neces
sary expenses, might solve the
problem by the method of a
certain lady who lives a few
miles out of town, but whose
name we shall not mention. She
had a mouth full of bad teeth
that whre impairing her health.
Her husband is well to do, but
got it into his head that spend
ing money on teeth is foolish
ness so he refused to give his
wife the necessary $25.00 for the
dentist. "Well, I will go into
town and find a job, then" she
said, "and will earn the money
myself, for I am going to have
my teeth fixed." In she came
and found a job at housework.
When she went back home for
her trunk and to bid her family
good bye, the old man recanted
and wrote her out a check for the
dental bill. "And I believe the
old man likes me better for mak
ing him dig up," she confided to
a News reporter.
Rev. J. H. Hoopingarner, of
the Methodist church performed
a maragge ceremony Sunday
evening at the parsonage for
Miss Eliza Stumbo of Webb City
and Mr. Arley Gunther of Carter
ville. Mrs. J. M. Nicholas arrived
home very recently from Detroit,
Mich., where she spent three
months visiting at the home of
her daughter, Mrs. L. C. Weaver.
Mrs. Nicholas reports a delight
ful visit. She saw many of the
sights about the big automobile
city, among which was a visit
through the Ford factory. The
weather there during the summer
was delightfully cool.

J. W. GRANTHAM,
There Is
A Vast Difference
Between aim and accomplishment. A man
may "aim" or intend to do a certain thing at
some future period of time, but the man wh o
actually accomplishes his purpose, is the man
who is continually at work along that particu
lar line.
