of the village to-day.
The (icrinans made desperate
efforts to win back a hold on the
hiphway wrested from them yester

repained L'Abba Wood and Hill 76,

French, who?c power sc?ms almo.-t

The French no longar are nibblin-j at

to-day was one of the niosr. briiliant of

Further north Combles haa been out?

THE WEDGE BETWEEN PERONNE AND BAPAUME.
The shadcd portion of the BUp ibowa the Allied gain since the beginning
of the Somme offeBaire. The sector divided off by the white line indicates
tha French advance Tuesday and yesfrday.
Foch has forced a wedge between Peronne and Bapaume by pu3hing for?
ward his lire beyond the national hifhway, running between these villages.
Combles ll cut off on the south and the southwest, and far outflanked
by the French drive. When the Bnti-h advance from Ginchy, it will be com

French Fight in Open
First Time in 2 Years
Foch's Troops Smash Through Powerful German Lines on
Somme and Win Advance by Field Iactics
and Troop Manoeuvres,
B> l RKD B. IMTNEY.
Paris, Sept. 13.?For the first time
in two years there took place yes?
terday on the Western front a battle
in the open ficld, where tactics and
mancruvres of troops, rather than
assaults on trenches, won an ad?
vance. This, more than anything
else, serves to show the extent of
the French jrains in the Somme
offensive and the tremendous ad
vances they have made.
Between Combles and the Somme
there is a gap more than four**and
a half miles wide, cut clear through
Cierman lines of fortitieations that
were two years in the building. Yes?
terday the French debouching
through this gap, defeated the Ger
mans in a series of manoeuvres in
the open country and drove them
back a distance varying from almost
two miles on the north to a little
more than 000 yards on the south.
French Fight for Homes.
Yesterday's encounter was in three
parts, and was fought by troops
battling veritablyafor their homes ?
for the French soldiers engaged
were those from the invaded dis?
tricts. Two nights of unremitting
cannonading utterly demolished the
German trenches.
The differenca between the
trenches here and those further west
was shown by the results of the
bombardrnent. The Western lines
were the finished effort of two years'
labor by the best military engineers
in the world. The trenches carried
yesterday were those of an army
operating in the field, which had
been allowed a few days' respitc to
dig itself in.
The difference was such that,
thirty minutes after the chargo
sounded, the French carried the
whole line of German entrenchment.s
from Combles to the river. Thi.* was
the first part of the battle, and it
was followed by the light in the
open.
As soon as the trenches were car?
ried the French guns were lifted,
and the .T.js raised a barrier east
of the Peronne-Bethunc road, pre
venting the Germans from bringing
up reinforcements, while the French
manoeuvrcd in th? open country.
Freneh Take a Hill.
The left wing swept forward from
a wood and drove the Germans from
Hill 14"). while another regiment
clearcd Marricres Wood, in front of
Bouchavesnes. The two forees then
joined hands and pushed on to the
Peronne-Bapaume road, which was
