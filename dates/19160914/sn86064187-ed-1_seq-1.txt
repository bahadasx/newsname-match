the subject addressed to luci by the
Japanese foreign office stating in un
eiiiivocal terms that Japan had not for
a moment entertained anv uitcnhoit oi

that the statements are entncl;. s,,i
isfactorv and that infinities regard
ing the new treatv, over which they
had been rnnsidering pertnrhecl, prob

I be note resulted from incpiiries
made by Ambassador fiuthrie at l'okio
by direction of the state department re
garding the effect nf the new treaty
Seek Stability in Orient.
A statement issued by the state de
partment makes public the note from
the Japanese government, which says:
The imperial government desires
to assure the American government
that the new convention is in no
sense dcsigrie'd to tepeal or modify
the provisions of article two of the
convention concluded between la
pan and Russia on July 23, l7,
nor has the imperial government
entertained for a moment any in
tention to depart from the policy
to which they have avowedly com
mitted themselves respecting the
maintenance of the independence
and territorial integrity of China
as well as the principle of eipial
opportunity for the trade of all na
tions in that country. (In the con
trary they are as strongly con
vinced as ever nf the usefulness of
that policy in the interest of the
general peace and stability in the
l;ar Last which they have always
very near their hearts.
Provisions Unimpaiied.
The result of similar iuiiiiries made
for the state department at Prtrograd
regarding the effect of the new treaty
is commented on by the state depart
ment as follows:
"The minister for foreign affairs of
the imperial Russian government in
like manner assured the American am
bassador in response to his incpiiry
that his government had not with
drawn from the conventions of 1'X)7
and ld0, but will maintain unimpaired
the provisions of those agreement's, not
withstanding the fact that no mention
of this was made in the convention of
1516.
