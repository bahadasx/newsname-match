FIERCE FIGHTING BUT 120 DECIDED RESULTS TODAY Oil
THE FROIITS
(Associated
London,' Sept. 14 The French have
paused in their advance north of
Peronne, where they have driven 4ix
miles into the German lines since July
1st, when the Somme offensive began.
They are now withstanding a series of
German counter attacks.
The entente forces are apparently
not pressing the Macedonian cam
paign on the right of Saloniki. The
British who crossed the Struma are
reported to have withdrawn to the
west bank.
Latest reports from both sides on
the campaign in Dobrudja, Rumania,
showed the opposing forces in contact
along virtually the entire front. Ap
parently a general engagement is im
pending. ,
Dispatches through Italy say an of
fensive campaign in the Balkans has
been mapped out at a conference of
the central powers now being held at
German headquarters. Germany's
contribution to the force is fixed at
200,000 and Austria's at 100,000 men.
TOOK BULGAR TRENCHES
The Serbians have captured Bulgar
ian trenches . near Votrentk, on the
Macedonian front, and the height to
fine northwest of Lake Ostrova, the
French war office says. The allies are
'declared to be winning' south of the
lake.
FRENCH HELD THEIR GROUND
In France German assaults were
repulsed north and south of the Som
me and at Vaux-Chapitre wood, on the'
Verdun front, the French assert.
BRUSSILOFF SAYS THE WAR
WILL END NEXT YEAR
That the war in Europe will end in
August, 1917, is the opinion of Gen
eral Brussiloff, given to a special cor
respondent of the New York Times
The Russian general says that he is
not a prophet, but says, if asked to
say when the war would end, he would
say August, 1917. He thinks by that
time the central powers will have been
whipped and ready to quit.

THAT SHADY SCHOOL GROUCH
Editor Star: In your issue of the!
13th, you have a wail from Shady
carrying something of a criticism of
the county school management.
With reference to the handling of
the school text books I will say that
that has been one of the most per
plexing problems that the county
board and myself have had to contend
with all these years. We have dis
cussed various methods of meeting
the necessities of the case, including
the handling of them at the office in
the courthouse, but for different con
siderations have so far felt that it
was better for them to be supplied
from the outside. It has all during
these years been the case that at
times all the WVs wid w Ka i
stock and it is' unavoidable that peo-1
ple will be disappointed sometimes
about eettimr them. I fullv annre-
date the feelin? of disammintment
and disgust in a measure that a party
from a distant part of the county
feels when they come to Ocala with a
Mist, of books to e-et and ran trt nnlv
a part or Dossiblv none of them. Wo
have conferred right along with the
dealers and they seem to be doing
what they can to supply the demands.
