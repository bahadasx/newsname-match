of Lynden. An extra six mil s Is
provided for, as last year, to lake
up old Warrants and clean up the
ancient Indebtedness of the el'y.

$2,000 in the past.

SUDAN GRASS FLOURISHES
IN LYNDEN DISTRICT
That Sudan grass, in yield and
quality as hay second on y to al
falfa, will flourish in the Lynden
dlattlet, is being demonstra-ed t!:is
year by a number of experimental
patches loc-a ly.
Among the largest and most
promising of these is that of An
drew Bosl-nd on his p ace in Lyn
den, whe-e the grass is eight or
nine feet in height. Mr. Roslund is
netting it go for seed, but experi
ments with an early cutting show
•4 that two big crops wou d be
yielded in She Lynden district, run
ning from eight to ten tons to the
icre.
Sudan grass makes a very nut i
icus and palatable hay. which is
.peat y relished by both Cstt'e and
horses.
"Yields of 2 to 4 tons per acre of
•ured hay are common, and ,mder
irrigation they run as high ;.s 8
o 10 tons," says a government bu -
eiin. "Sudan grass can a so be cut
3 r roen and used as a soiling crop to
jrood advantage, In feeding value
it is no do.ibt practical y identical
»llh sweet sorghums, t'nder irti«a
ion, three cuttings are obtained
md the yie ris and quality of the
lay are second only to alfa la."
Fanners interested slould make
i a point to inspect the patch on
