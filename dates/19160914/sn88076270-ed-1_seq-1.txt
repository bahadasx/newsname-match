METHODS OF DAKOTA'S
FIRST CORN FARMERS
INDIAN TRIBES' CORN SUCCESS
DATES FROM 70 YEARS BACK,
ON MISSOURI
As a contribution to Indian corn
literature the description following of
some methods evolved by the first
farmers on the plains is interesting
and of practical value. The writer,
E. W. Hall, agricultural agent of Wilr
liams county, was born and raised
among the Ft. Berthold Indians. The
Indian, in the very early days, found
corn to be an important aid to sub
sistence to make a success of corn
growing he exerted all of his instinc
tive judgment, according to many au
thorities. Mr. Hall says:
The Indians on the Ft. Berthold In
dian reservation in northwestern
North Dakota have raised corn long
er than the oldest members of the
tribe can remember. Their fields have
been located all along the Missouri
river through North Dakota. One
field, located near the old village,
where all three tribes, Mandan, Fros
Ventre apd Arikarees, lived together
for some years, has been under culti
vation for at least seventh-two years.
Beans and squash were raised, beside
the principal crop, corn.
One of the important operations in
Indian corn culture is the curing of
the seed. The seed is picked early
but no particular field selection is
made. The corn is husked and spread
out on corn scaffolds which are made
by setting four or six posts, forked
at the top, and poles placed along the
The principal thing, in this Indian
curing process is getting the corn
perfectly dry. Practically every In
dian house at the present time has
one of these corn drying scaffolds in
front of the house and this scaffold
has always been part of the home's
equipment.
The writer asked one old Indian
man how he tested his corn. He said
that he did not test it because he
knew it was good and would grow. It
always did. The stand in every In
dian field proves his statement. It is
very rare to find a missing hill. Dry
seed is the reason for this. Even
the fields in the summer of 1916, when
the year previous, 1915, was a poor
year, are practically perfect stands.
The Mandan Indians have a "keep
er of the corn.'' A daughter of their
former chief holds the office at pres
ent and it is her sacred duty to pre
serve the seed from year to year. She
cultivates her field very faithfully and
cures the seed and'preserves it very
carefully. This is a splendid example
to the white man of the value of good
seed corn and caring for it carefully.
The exact method used by the In
dians in curing seed may not apply
to our corn as the dent contains
so much water and does not get as
ripe, or as dry in the field, as the flint
corns, but the principle applies to any I
corn, that is to get the seed dry. There
is no question but what there would
be a much better supply of good seed
corn in North Dakota from home
grown fields, and good seed too, if the
farmer would go through his fields
and pick his corn in a wagon and
spread it out on scaffolds to dry dur
ing the fall. It certainly is far su
perior to the all too common method
of picking seed corn out of the shock
or bundle during the fall or winter,
or not saving seed at all and depend
ing on the 'seed firms for seed that
may be shipped in and is not raised
in the immediate locality.
Much can be learned from Indian
corn culture and the North Dakota
farmer is going to prize the Indian
corn more highly as the years go
bv and he raises more hogs and sheep.
These classes of livestock will harvest
the corn in the field without any
wsstc«
In anv event take this lesson from
the Indian. Get the corn out early
and dry it thoroughly if you want to
have good seed.
ADDRESSED MEDICAL SOCIETY
The Kotana Medical Society met at
the office of Dr. M. E. Trainor Tues
day evening and listened to an inter
esting: address by Dr. Moulton of
Detroit, Mich., on the use and value
of serums in the treatment of dis
eases. The doctor, who is a repre
sentative of the Park Davis Company
of Detroit, spoke also of the results
of recent research in connection with
infantile paralysis.
After the meeting the society en
tertained Dr. Moulton at *supper at
the Great Northern cafe.

The completion of the white
way lighting system is practically
assured by October 1st.
Commenting on this fact one of
the progressive men of the city
remarked to the Graphic man
that the new lighting system
would be the most noticed and
best appreciated of all our recent
city and community improve
ments.
"Coming close upon the heels
of such aquisitions as the Arm
ory-auditorium
and the pontoon
bridge, and along with extensive
street improvements and greatly
enlarged school facilities, not_ to
mention a season of unusual build
ing activity, the turning of cur
rent into the new white way will
marl* an important epoch in VVil
liston's growth," continued the
speaker. "Our people should
not neglect the opportunity to
fittingly celebrate in a way that
will give us all a fuller measure
of appreciation of the splendid
city and country we live in."
"Call it Appreciation Day, or
Achievement Day, or what you
will, let us plan an afternoon and
evening that will edify and en
tertain and unite—a gala day
when the city will be on dress
parade to welcome our neighbors
from far and near—and, so far
as is practical, let it be to our
guests a free day. Let the plans
be worked out carefully and along
original lines but within practi
cal limits."
Let's do it—for the City of

Engineers Inspect
The Pontoon Bridge
The U. S. boat Mandan came up
stream Friday bearing representa
tives of the war department to in
spect the Williston pontoon bridge.
The smaller hinged span was opened
and the Mandan passed through.
When the government boat return

asked to have both hinged sections
opened. The larger or south side
section was opened down stream and

DIES AT THE BORDER
LIEUT. E. W. JEFFREY HERE ON
DETAIL WITH REMAINS—
THE ONLY DEATH
Christian E. Boe who enlisted with
Company E shortly before it depart
ed for Fort Lincoln died at Mercedes
September 6, only four days after he
went to the hospital. The cause of
death was ulcer of the stomach, an
ailment that undoubtedly had come
on him before enlistment.
Boe, whose home is in Alexander
volunteered as second cook, and per
formed his duties well. He did not
complain of ill health until the Sat
urday preceeding his death. This is
the only death that has occurred in
the North Dakota regiment since it
was ordered to' the border.
First Lieut. E. W. Jeffrey of Com
pany E was detailed to accompany
the remains home and arrived on No.
3 Tuesday evening. Wednesday Lieut.
Jeffrey and Private Charnholm went
with the remains to Alexander where
impressive services were held at the
Lutheran church. The deceased was
about 25 years of age, and was born
in Norway. His father resides at
Alexander.
John Bruegger made a business

TRAVELS 0,000 MILES
III TWELVE STATES
AUTO TOUR TAKES LOCAL PEO
PLE INTO ALL PARTS OF
WEST—GONE 60 DAYS
After traveling in every state of
the West and Southwest with the ex
ception of Utah and Nevada, Mr. and
Mrs. H. W. Braatelien returned to
Williston Saturday. They left here
on their annual automobile tour July
8, and between then and September
9 they visited a dozen states and
travelled 5911 miles.
Leaving Williston on Saturday and
traveling through Montana, Wyom
ing, South Dakota, Nebraska and Col
orado, they reached Santa Fe, New
Mexico, at noon on the eighth day of
their journey. Here they rested a
day and the remainder of the trip
was taken somewhat more leisurely.
After visiting the most attractive
points in southern California! the
tourists moved northward to Oregon
and Washington. At San Bernardino
they met A. S. Maloney, an attorney
formerly located in Williston. At San
Diego they found Fred Lyon, former
ly of Ambrose, and well known to
many Williston people.
At Central Point, near Medford,
Oregon, they had a pleasant visit
with Mr. and Mrs. E. G. Schollander,
who for six years was superintendent
of the Williston Experimental Farm.
Mr. Braatelien found business con
ditions very bad along the coast, par
ticularly in California. The crop of
eastern tourists was short this season
and the Californians are complaining
bitterly of hard times. The only sec
tions where prosperous conditions
were found that compared at £11 fa
vorably with northwestern^ North
Dakota were the wheat and live stock
districts. Mr. Braatelien says that
such a trip is the best means of
gaining accurate first hand knowledge
of the country, and is also the surest
way to bring a full appreciation of
our own splendid country. As a place
of opportunity for the man of small
means, he is satisfied there is abso
lutely no place that compares with
this section of the West.
Mr .and Mrs. Braatelien carried a
tent and camping outfit and slept in
the open during the entire trip. Their
Ford, aside from a few worn out ti^es,
gave practically no trouble. The most
common price of gasoline was found
to be 30 cents per gallon, although
as much as 45 cents was paid in New
Mexico and as little as 17 cents in
California.
A North Dakota car so far from
home attracted much attention, in one
town in the southwest a district
judge stopped on the street and took
judicial notice of the N. D. tag.
This was the longest trip Mr. and
Mrs. Braatelien have ever made, and
while they thoroughly enjoyed every
day of it, it is doubtful if they will
undertake another of such great
length. In general they found ex
cellent roads and'were favored by dry
weather. Only once, in Yosemite Na
tional Park, were they obliged to turn
back on account of practically im
passable roads.
LOU SHOWS THE HOME FOLKS
HOW IT IS DONE IN N. D.
Louie Kolls, pitcher and utility
player with the Williston Opportune*
is finishing the season with the Rock
Island, 111., league team. In a recent
came with Moline, Kolls pitched the
last seven innings, held his opponents
to five hits and won the game by
making two two-baggers and a triple.
The Rock Island papers gave him
warm praise. Kolls tried out with
the R. I. gquad last spring and was
considered not quite mature enough
for Three I company. His improve
ment in form speaks well for his
training with the Opportunes under
Old Reliable, alias "Scoop" Marshall.
ENTERTAINED AT ONE O'CLOCK
LUNCHEON
Mrs. John Craig, Mrs. Wm. Brod
ericn, Mrs. Frank E. Fisk, Mrs. Geo.

wax were hosts to a large party of
their friends at one o'clock luncheon
at Odd Fellows hall Wednesday. Cards
and sewing were the chief features
of a delightful afternoon. A pro
fusion of cut flowers and potted
plants made the hall very beautiful.
MARRIED IN MONTANA
Norman Eidsness and Miss Clara
Kallak were married at the home of
Rev. Lundeen, at Homestead, Mont.,
September 4. After a honeymoon
trip to the Twin Cities Mr. and Mrs.
Eidsness made a brief visit with Wil
liston relatives and left this morning
for Reserve, Montana, where the
groom is engaged in the mercantile
business.
Mr. Ei'dsness is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. A. N. Eidsness and grew to man
hood in this city where he gained a
host of friends by many good

WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1916. $1.50 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
FIELD OF SERVICE
FOR COM AGENTS
CONNECTING LINK .BETWEEN
1AHM ORGANIZATIONS AND
FEDERAL LOAN BANKS
That County Agents will find a
now sphere of usefulness in lending
aid to farmers in organizing to ob
tain the benefits of Federal Farm
Loan Banks, is the opinion of Director
Cooper of the North Dakota Experi
ment Station.
The act which creates the Federal
Land Banks, provides that the De
partment of Agriculture sh^ll assist
the Federal Farm Loan Board in dis
seminating information relative to
the act and shall aid in instructing
farmers how to organize and conduct
Farm Loan Associations. The Coun
ty Agents are joint employees of the
Federal Department of Agriculture,
the State Agricultural College, and
the county employing them.^
Mr. Cooper interprets' this section
of the act to mean that it will event
ually become the duty of the County
Agents, who are the local represen
tatives of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, to instruct farm
ers in the organizing and conducting
of the Farm Loan Associations.
A general field meeting of County
Agents will be held in the near future
at which time instructions will be
given relative to the different fea
tures of the law and the steps that it
will be necessary to take in the es
tablishment of local Loan Associa
tions. It may be that the County
Agents, as federal employees, will
become the principal local agencies
whereby the Federal Farm Loan
Board will maintain direct contacts
with the farmers of the state. The
fact that a county employes a County
Agent may mean a great deal to
farmers who wish to take advantage
of the provisions of this law. Here
tofore a County Agent has been em
ployed chiefly, calling attention to
the fundamental principle of good
agriculture in the state, in order to
bring about more profitable methods
of farming. This new activity is a
very natural development of this
sphere of the County Agent, and in
this new work the County Agents
will render the farmers of their coun
ty an important service. Each Agent
nas been supplied with copies of the
law and a brief preliminary state
ment of its application. In addition
they have been instructed to give
farmers all possible information
relative to this act.

Local Women Greet
Creator Of "Tish"
One of America's most talent
ed literary women, Mary Roberts
Rinehart, was a passenger on the
Oriental Limited Friday, enroute
east after a season at Glacier Na
tional park. She was accompan
ied by her three young sons. Mes
damcs Overson, Dochterinan,
Burk, Creaser and Hogan and
Messrs Burk, Hogan and Morrill
greeted Mrs. Kim-hart and pre
sented her with several bouquets
of garden flowers.
Expressing her pleasure at the
courtesy and telling of her in
terest in the West Mrs. Rinehart
charmed her callers by her con
versation and pleasing person
ality. In recent years she has
spent mucji of her time during
summer in the mountains and
does some of her literary work
there.
Mrs. Rinehart is one of the
most versatile and popular writ
ers of the day. She is the au
thor of many fascinating pieces
of fiction including the stories of
"Tish" and her humorous adven
tures. Last year she was sent to
the war zone by the Saturday
Evening Post where she inter
viewed the kind and queen of
Belgium and was shown distin
guished consideration by military
heads.
Her word pictures of conditions
on the western front were among
the best things that have been
written about the war.
ONCE MORE GREECE
IS NEARA DECISION
CABINET RESIGNS IN DESPAIR
—IMMEDIATE ACTION EX
PECTED—ALLIES SUCCEED
London, Sept. 13.—With the res
ignation of Premier Zaimis and his
cabinet announced, entente diplo
Greek situation immediate action
is anticipated, and the London and
Paris governments make no secret
of their belief that the next step
will be the entry of Greece into the
war on the side of the entente.
The French and English continue
their terrific drive on the Somme
front. Bouchavesnes, located in the
Combles district, has fallen into the
hands of the French. On the Ver
dun front, the French also con
tinued their advance.
Word from the Macedonian bat
tle line was more reassuring to the
entente allies today. It is reported
thdt the Serbians, despite terrific
resistance on the part of the Teutonic
armies, have made much progress.
French Capture Village
Paris, Sept. 13.—The French cap
tured the village of Bouchavesnes, on
the Somme front, it was officially an
nounced today. The village, which is
in the region of Combles, was taken
from the Germans last evening. The
French also took by assault a wood
600 yards east of the road from
Peronne to Bethune. On the Verdun
front, the French progressed in the
northern part of Vaux-Chapitre wood.
Notwithstanding the stout resist
ance of the Teutonic allies, Serbian
troops on the Macedonian front have
made important progress at various
points, the war office announces. Vio
lent fighting is progressing in the vi
cinity of Lake Ostrove, where the
Serbians gained considerable ground.
Cabinet Resigns
Athens, via London, Sept. 13.—
French and Serbian troops have taken
the offensive on the western end of
the Macedonian front. They cap
tured the town of Sorovitz, near
Fiorina. King Constance has ac
cepted the resignation of Premier
Zaimis and his cabinet.
London, Sept. 13.—The belief is en
tertained in trie Entente capitois that
the retirentent of the Zaimis ministry
is preliminary to the entrance of
Greece in the war with the Allies.
Recent dispatches from Berlin and
Vienna show that tljere also it is re
garded as probable that Greece soon
will abandon her neutrality and join
the Entente.
The precise causes leading to the
resignation of the ministry have not
been disclosed, on account of the ex
ceptionally rigid censorship.
It is believed here that" the resigna
tion is due to the fact that Zaimi3 ac
cepted the premiership on the under
standing that he was to maintain neu
trality and that in view of the Bul
garian occupation of Greek territory
he had found this impossible.
Petrograd, Sept. 13.—The Russians
are holding the ground won recently
in the fighting in the Carpathians, de
spite heavy counter attacks by the
Teutonic forces, according to today's
official announcement.
ON RECRUITING DUTY
Private T. V. Craven who was de
tailed from Company E as recruiting
officer arrived home last Friday and
Monday went to Minot to join the
other members of the recruiting force.
Minot and Bismarck have been desig
nated as recruiting stations. Private
Craven appears in splendid health
and has enjoyed his service at the

'V "'.V,
LIGNITE LINE FOR
BLACK DIAMOND MINE
NARROW GAUGE ROAD TO MILL
ER'S SPUR WILL FACILITATE
SHIPPING
A thirty-six inch gauge private
railroad is now being constructed
from the Black Diamond coal mine to
Miller's spur on the Great Northern
line, just east of the city.
N. B. Ludowese, operator of the
Black Diamond, has crews of survey
ors and graders employed on the
work and rails, ties and a locomotive
are either here or on the way. The
road is expected to be ready for use
in about three weeks.
The same cars that are loaded in
the mine will be pulled to the siding
where chutes will convey the coal to
wagons or rail road cars. The mine
road will be two and a half miles in
length decreasing the wagon haul to
Williston by that much and elimin
ating the part of the road that is_ at
some seasons very bad. The filling
of orders for distant points will be
greatly facilitated and Mr. Ludowese
reports a large increase in this busi
ness already in sight.
The incline leading to the mouth of
the mine will be double tracked and
the loaded cars will draw the empties
up. At the unloading end the grade
will be such as to place the cars on
a fifteen foot tressle in position for
dumping.
It) constructing the road bridges
will be necessary over Crazy Man's
Coulee and Stony Creek but the gen
eral lay of the ground is favorable.
Fire Insurance
Federation Formed
On Tuesday Harry C. Wilbur, Far
go, North Dakota, Executive Secre
tary of the Insurance Federation of
North Dakota, was in Williston for
the purpose of affecting a Fire In

agents who reside in Williston, but
not sufficient time was allowed for
agents outside of Williston to attend
the meeting at the later meetings
more time will be had and a better
representation can be present. There
are about fifteen or twenty members
of the insurance federation residing
in Williams county.
An executive committee was elected
for Williams county composed of E.
C. Carney, Chairman, J. A. Lavalle,
George F. Carpenter, W. N. Dickin
son, G. M. Everson, Ernest Bylin of

Yeggs Caught In Act
At Buford Sunday
Citizens of Buford discovered bur
glars at work in the store of the Bu
ford Mercantile Co., Sunday night and
the place was surrounded by an arm
ed posse. The yeggs finally yielded to
the command to come out but at
tempted to escape by running.
Members of the posse fired with
shot guns and the men were so well
peppered that they surrendered. Sher
iff Erickson was summoned and
brought the prisoners to the county
jail that night.
County Attorney Owens filed a
charge of burglary in the third degree
to which the defendants, who give the
names of Harry Shaffer and Jack
Lester, pleaded guilty. Sentence has
not yet been passed. Shaffer has
been in this vicinity for many years
and is said to have been at one time
an employee of "Step" Davis at
Coney Island, New York.
Officer Says Border
Duty Is Beneficial
First Lieut. E. W. Jeffrey, who was
detailed to accompany the remains of
Private Boe from Mercedes, was the
center of interest after his arrival
Tuesday evening. The lieutenant re
ports every member of the company
as eager for more activity and if there
is no chance for field service most of
them would not be sorry to hear of
an order to return home.
The drill and camp life has been a
splendid experience for the militia,
says the lieutenant. Practically
every man is in the pink of condi
tion. Jeffrey haS the privilege of
remaining home until ordered back
to his regiment.
