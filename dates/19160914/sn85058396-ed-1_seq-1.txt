Germans Counter Attack on the I
I j Somme But Fail to Gain Ground ! I
1 Great Battle About to
be Fought Along the
i Entire Rumanian Front
, i
'
The French have paused In their
advance north of Peronne, where they
have driven a total distance of six
miles Into the German lines since July
1, when the Somme offensive began,
and now are withstanding a series of
German counter-attacks.
Assaults were delivered last night
on the new French positions both
north and south of the Somme, but
were fruitless, according to today's
Paris bulletin.
The Macedonian campaign of the
entente forces apparently is not be
ing pressed on the right of the Sa
loniki position, the British who ad
vanced across the Struma being re
ported to have withdrawn to the west
bank. The Serbians, however, are
continuing their pressure against the
Bulgarians along the western end of
the line. The French war office an
rl nounces that the engagemet near
Lake Ostrovo is turning In favor of
the allies, and that Bulgarian trenches
and a height northwest of Lake Os
rovo have been captured by the Serb
ians. Latest reports from both sides of
the campaign in the Rumanian pro
vince of Dobrudja show the opposing
forces in contact along virtually the
entire front. Apparently a general
engagement is impending.

TO SOLVE COURSE
WITHJEEANS
American Members to Present
Ideas to Mexican Associates
for General Discussion.
New London, Conn., Sept. 14.
American members of the internation
al commission meeting here were
occupied today with the Mexican con
ferees in investigating the cause and
effect of Mexican mining decrees and
advising with Major-General Bliss as
to the military situation on the border.
There is little prospect that the joint
commission will return to the formula
tion of a border proctocol until the
American members have reached a
tentative agreement among them
selves as to the wisest course to pur
sue. They will then present their
Ideas to their Mexican asso
ciates for general discussion.
It was indicated today that ques
tions of real estate and other taxes in
Mexico as they effect American prop
erty holders will be looked Into by the
joint commission when its examina
tion of the mining taxes has been com
pleted. In the case of land taxes un
der Carranza decrees a punitive dam
age is assessed against lands lying
Idle which American Interests have
complained to the state department
amounted to confiscation of their hold
ings. As in the case of mining taxes,
American officials have asserted that
their purpose was to foster small oper
ators and to compel the abandonment
of large land holdings for speculative
purposes only.
As yet the proposition has not tak
en definite steps but it Is learned that
the American commissioners with
whom the plan appears to be growing
in favor, talked it over last night
with Major-Genqral Tasker H. Bliss
and that they devoted part of today to
further conferences with him on this
and other projects.
During the joint conference today
the commissioners were told that
Mexico still adheres to her existing
constitution and legal codes, a point
on which there had been much doubt
In the United States. Until August 1.
last, the Mexican members said, the
provisions of the constitution had
been suspended by the war, but with
the re-establishment of civil courts
which began on that date, the old
codes again became effective and
would continue so until they could be
revised through necessary constitu
tional amendments and acts of congress.

GREAT CROWDS AGAIN
ATTEND PEACH
DAY EVENTS
At the office of the Ogden, Logan fc
Idaho Railway company it was esti
mated that up to i o'clock more than
GOO persons from Ogden alone jour
noyod to Brlgham City today to attend
the Peach Day celebration being held
there. An oven greater number were
transported to the Box Elder county
seat from northern stations along the
railroad.
Brigham City residents in charge of
the celebration figured that the at
tendance for the annual festivity
would go beyond the 10,000 mark.
Reports from that place received at
the office of the electric railway com
pany were to the effect that visitors
were arriving on all Incoming trains. ,
The Salt Lake & Ogden railway,
co-operating with the Ogden, Logan
& Idaho in handling the passenger
traffic, delivered large numbers from
points betwen Ogden and Salt Lake
into the city this morning. These
same persons board ca cars of the O.,
L. & I. at the terminal and proceeded
direct to Brigham City, the goal of
the journey planned solely on account
of the Peach Day celebration.
The Oregon Short Line carried hun
dred from Salt Lake on a special train
run through this point to Brigham
this morning.
A special hourly car sorvice is be
ing maintained for the day on the
O., L & I. The first car, loaded with
Peach Day celebrators, left the city
at 7:30 this morning. The last car
destined for that point will leave at
11:30 tonight. Returning the last car
will leave Brigham City at 12 o'clock
midnight. The last car north bound
is scheduled to leave Brigham City
thirteen minutes after 12. All cars
carry special equipment arranged for
the comfort and convenience of the
passengers. The regular two-hour
schedule is being maintained between
Brigham and points north. Additional
cars have been added to the trains
which are proving equal to the traffic
afforded.
By noon the bulk of the crowd had
arrived at Brigham and the celebra
tion was opened by a program at the
court house at which many prominent
men of the state and county made
brief addresses. Musical numbers by
the bands interspersed the addresses.
After the moetlng the distribution of
souvenir boxes of peaches was begun.
The following committee supervised
the distribution, which was done by
.numerous little girls:
Mrs. Dan Petersen, Mrs. David Ros
enbaum, Mrs. Ephraim Mathlas. Miss
Eliza Hanson and Miss Trieste Box.
Each souvenir box contained two
large, selected peaches. Besides these
a booth where people could eat
peaches. Besides these a booth where
people could eat peaches to their
heart's content, was located on the
grounds in the city park.
At Brigham.
The program for the afternoon, be
ginning at 2 p. m. includes an aviation
meet in which the noted aviator Terah
Maroney will give a number of flights,
using a new flying machine and start
ing from the ball park grounds. Aft
er that event the big baseball game
will be on between the Brigham
Peaches and the Stnhl and Dean team
of Salt Lake for state amateur cham
pionship honors, besides a large cash
purse to the winning team.
The visitors will fill in the balance
of the day listening to band concerts,
and dancing, afternoon and evening.
OGDEN HIGH TO HAVE
FAST HH FROM
OTHER SCHOOLS
'We're going to cop that pennant
this year for sure," was the state
ment of Manager Roger Connor in
speaking of the high school's football
squad of this fall. According to Mr.
Connor's report, the Tiger's chances
for a championship team are the best
since 1910. There are at present three
full teams on the training table and
Conch Ray W. Shlrey declares them
to be the heaviest and speediest
bunch in the state.
The coach was elated over the fact
that only threo of last year's entire
squad are missing in this season's
lineup. These places can easily be
filled by the many second string men
of last year together with the new
additions from other schools.
Wilkinson, from the Weber acad
emy, who made a name for himself
on that school's basketball team last
season, is bidding fair for a berth on
the "Tiger" lineup. Erwin of Boise,
is also showing up fine in practice.
Bagley, Fox, L. Falck, M. Conroy, V.
Conroy, Kingsford, Dee, GInsmanu,
L. Allison, K. Allison, Staley, Rich
ards, Miller, Tripp, Cross and others
of last year's lineup are well seasoned
players on whom the coach can de
pend to "bring home the bacon."
The students arc overjoyed at their
warriors' prospects and declare they
will back them to the finish. This
fall they are going to have the Boise
team here and together with showing
them a good time, they will also be
shown a little "football."
West Side high of Salt Lake the
old time rivals of Ogden is in a poor
condition this season. Only four men
of their last year's team returned to
help "Heinle" Richardson, which
makes it look as if the "Panthers aro
in for a "mauling."
East Side high got a walloping from
the "Tigers" last year so, taking the
thing in general, it looks mighty good
for the "Orange and Black,"

HOW TO PIP ITER
FROM THE BIG GAIL
One of the features of the opening
day at Sunset Heights will be a public
demonstration of the most scientific
irrigation system of the interniquntain
country. The Davis-Weber Land com
pany will make special efforts to
prove to the satisfaction of the pub
lic that the engineering feature of
Sunset Heights is a perfect one. Mr.
Emmett F. Annis will make a per
sonal explanation and conduct the vis
itors over the entire system, explain
ing all the engineering features of the
irrigation system, commencing at the
power plant, showing the entire ad
vantages of the amount of power that
is obtained from the waters of the
canal. He will also show the amount
of water delivered through 24-lnch
redwood pipe to the different eleva
tions throughout the project Mr. An
nis, president of the Davis-Weber
Land company, and chief engineer,
will without a question of doubt prove
to the satisfaction of any person that
the up-to-date pumping system Is a
saver of time, water and money. The
engineering feature of the system is
in practical operation in every part
of the United States with the explana
tion of the power. The conditions that
exist elsewhere are compelled to op
erate by means of electricity, where
In this case the same waters that are
used for Irrigation, furnish the power
and therefore reduces the cost of
pumping materially. The company Is
not laboring under possibilities, but
mere facts that have already been
proven. The entire system has been
tested time and time again.

STAGE COACHES IE j I
TO BE DRIVEN FROM I
MLOWSTOI I
That the old stage coaches between
Yellowstone station and in the Yel- 8

probability, he relegated into history
next year in favor of automobiles, was i ' JM
the statement of L. M. McLaughlin to- J
day. Mr. McLaughlin is a member of f J
the Weber county force of school prln- J j
cipals and has just returned from Yel- I !
lowstone park, where he passed the J "
summer. 1
This year, he said, 11,000 persons 8
toured the park in automobiles with : t
much, greater comfort than was ever S
enjoyed in the days when the stage I i
coaches were the exclusive mode of i! EH
travel. The road between Yellow-
stone and the park Is now being paved
and those in the park improved as j
fast as possible. I
The use of automobile stages and I
trucks, the Ogden man says, will I jH
greatly facilitate the transportation of J .H
freight, baggage and tourists from the
railroad station to and through the
park and will permit of the regular &
"loop" tour being made in time to al-
low of many other side trips in the pe-
