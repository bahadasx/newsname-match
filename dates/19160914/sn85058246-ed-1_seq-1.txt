with llfo and motion, nnd Logan peo
plo will bo given the first chance at
tho Lyric Theater to see with the oyo
tho beautiful half breed California
maiden, who heretofore has been Is
lblo to tho imagination only through
the pngoj of Mrs. Helen Hunt Juck
hou's delightful lomancc.
Rnmono, which Is a cinema operat
ic production of tho novel, from the
(.tudlo of tho famous California direc
tor, W. II. Cluno, will open a two
days engagement nt tho Lyric on
Tuesday and Wednesday not, Sop
lumber 19 and 20, theti will bo a

A complete operatic score has been
written and arranged to follow every
moment of tho story flashed on the
screen and this score Is interpreted
by a symphony orchestra of twenty
five musicians. A chorus of mission
singers' will bo heard In tho beautiful
hymn at dawn.
So vividly remembered by readers
of Ramona, and several other vocal
numbers scattered admirably Inter
pretative of tho spirit of the Califor
nia romance
Ramona, is credited with having
sot a now high standard In the recent
lydc eloped art of the moving vlc

'it ls tho first of the productions tp
win Its way on Us own merits an a
romance, without tho accompaniment
of outsldo sensationalism. It Iiob no
suggestion of Immorality, makes no
appeal to political prejudice nor pa
triotism and has no propaganda. It
tells a wondorfully sweet story and
tells It woll, appealing legitimately
to tho emotions aroused by any work'
Of tho highest art. Its success In'
Los Angeles, San Francisco, .N(?w

Many Are Being Urged By Their ' Sl
Friends To Enter Race. This 1

Thoro will bo an abundance of can- .j jl
dldntel fur tho various nominations ijfil
nt tho Republican convention next jfalSI
Suturdny. From the north, Louis jVrfl
McCnrry of Richmond, is spoken of ,ll
for tho legislature; from tnu central Vffl

of ns n likely candidate; from tho ft'I

a good man for tho Job; nt Hyrum, 1"M

For tho office of sheriff, wo have TB
prospective candidates galoro. At 3h9
Lowiston, Floyd Wliltt Is said to be VjH
a good man tor the oh; at Hyrum, J WJM
City Marshal, Ivcr Albortson Is said dil
to be u candidate. Fred Whittle of
Richmond Is another good man spok- 991
en of for the placo. wl
Jauios Hansen of Provldnnco, a llfo flH
long Republican and n iiinu well Wwk
thought of hi his community, may bo myH
named for county assessor, Martin Sl
Olscn of Mlllvillo ls a candldato for aBB
this position; Wlllard Chugg of Provl-
ilcnco Is said to bo a candidate for sH
this olllco, as woll as Fred Bnllatn of Vm
llydo Park. Wm
Judging from tho numbor of candl- Ilfl
dates for the various nominations, HWM
this will surely bo a Hcpubllcan,ycar ' iN
In Cache county. As goes Mnlno, "'so 11fc
i;ocs tho nation, has been a political ll
dogan tor the 'past thirty two years -iKH
and It has only failed once, and the um
nxceptlon goes to provo tho rulo. Soc- Mjl
rotary Daniels considers tho result VUm
of tho Mnlno election a victory for Km
I ho Democrats. If tho Democrats can H
get any satisfaction out of losing a PI
utato by 13,500 votCB, they aro wM- Wjj2
uoino ,to, nil, of tho satisfaction thoro WMt
Is In it. ' BB
In tho matter of county clerk, tho fflffil
iiamo of Henry McCracken, is ono JHtS
of tho recent names to bo thrown In- M
to tho political ring. This nnmo mD
should almost scare tho roof off tho H
Uomocratlc shnnty, as Mr, McCrnck- lH
en Is ono of tho finest young men In WjS,
tho county. If ho should get the nom- ill
Inutlon for county clork, thoro Is lit- rUm
tlo question but what ho will bo VJi
