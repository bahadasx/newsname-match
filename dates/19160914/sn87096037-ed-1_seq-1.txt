Are You Looking Old?
Old age comes quick enough without
inviting it. Some look old at forty.
That is because they neglect the liver
and bowels. Keep your bowels regu
lar and your liver healthy and you
will not only feel younger but look
younger. When troubled with con
stipation and billiousness take Cham
berlain's Tablets. They are intended
especially for these ailments and are
excellent. Easy to take and most
agreeable in effect. Obtainable eve
rywhere.—Adv.
Don't be a Second Classer!
YOU WILL be in that class if you insist
on using kerosene lights—the superiority of
ELECTRIC LIGHTS are bringing them in
popular favor.
