Wm. F. Byne Elected Commander
At 24th Encampment of Veterans
Prom all over southern Oregon
there are gathered in Ashland the
veterans of the wars of the United
States for their twenty-fourth annual
reunion. Although the ranks are fast
thinning, the parades of men In blue
which pass through Ashland's streets
are made up of men who walk with j
heads held high . and the military j
hearing of soldiers who have fought
and suffered. The old familiar tunes '
played by some bent and gray-headed j
veteran are listened to with more at-1
tentlon than the classical selections;
of the most famous band.
Thursday morning the annual
election of officers was held with the ;
following results: William F. Byne, .
commander; James Mattlngly, lleu-j
tenant colonel; John B. Renault,
major; Mrs. A. G. Spencer, chaplain.
The election of a quartermaster was
deferred. j
Practically every community of
southern Oregon Is represented at
the encampment from Roseburg to
Klamath Falls. The reunion Is one !
of the largest attended and at the
same time most generally enjoyable
of any held in recent years. The
Chautauqua park provides an ideal
camping place for the veterans, each
i i 1 1 j t.i . .
01 wnora is proviueu wim a icui,
bedding and straw tick. The busi
ness sessions and entertainment have
been held for the most part in the
Chautauqua tabernacle, whose prox
imity to the camp grounds enables
even the crippled and infirm among
toe old soldiers to attend without In
convenience. One hundred and thirteen old sol
diers had registered up to noon
Thursday, and one hundred and ten
members of the W. R. C. Total reg
istration will probably approach
three hundred, as tomorrow will
bring numbers from down the valley
and every train,brings a few more."
A huge camp fire burns every night
and around this the old comrades
gather to "swap lies" as a grizzled
old veteran put it. Old war aongs,
lories and reminiscences ara told
and retold late into the night. The
weather man has been exceptionally
kind, perhaps recognizing the fact
that the men who once slept night
after night In rivers of rain are no
longer able to withstand such hard
ship. Cool, sunshiny days and
balmy nights have made the outing
perfect.
Twenty members of the Southern
Oregon veterans' Association have
answered the last bugle call since
last year's reunion In Medford. Five
of these were from Ashland and nine
from Medford.
All of the tricks which enlivened
the camp life of those long ago days
when most of these men were lively
boys are re enacted in the encamp
ment. Almost every hour a detach
Probi Special Will
Make Long Stay
For the first time in history the
nominees of the prohibition party are
touring the country in a special
train. This train left Chicago on
the 8th and will reach Portland on
the 15th, where the speakers will ad
dress the people at the Ice Palace,
where Billy Sunday and Justice
Hnghes have already spoken in this
campaign.
The wives of the nominees will be
aboard the train, as will also Daniel
Poling, an Oregon boy, graduated at
Dallas College, and Oliver W. Stew
art, newspaper correspondents and
others. The train consists of two
Pullmans, a day coach and a baggage
ear.
One of the many speakers will ar
rive in Ashland ahead of the special
and will begin the speaking at the
Chautauqua Tabernacle at 8 p. m.
Mr. Hanly says that he does not
expect to be the next president, but
he hopes to make national prohibi
tion so prominent that it will soon
be realized in fact.
Ex-Governor Hanley was in Ash
land on a Chautauqua, tour some
time ago. and has written a book;
"A Day in the Sisklyous," the scene
of which is Ashland. He says that
when he retires he hopes to spend
his days at Ashland. s '
Hanly, Landrith, Poling nad Stew
art were all through Oregon two
years ago on the flying squadron and
met with favor at every point.
The special train will remain here
until 1 o'clock p.' m. Sunday, and it
Is sot unlikely that either the mem-
ment headed by a bass drum marches
upon the business district and re
turns triumphantly to the camp bear
ing a watermelon carried in a
stretcher decorated with flags.
This Thursday afternoon the vet
erans and W. R. C. ladles marched
to the West school building, where
with appropriate exercises an im
mense flag was presented to tho
school. Mrs. Crocker made the pre
sentation speech. Needless to say
the sight of the grizzled old veterans
of the wars which they read about
In their histories, standing at salute
to the flag, inspired more than a
passing patriotism in the children of
the schools.
The Entertainment.
Monday evening at the armory
Mayor O. H. Johnson welcomed the
veterans of the city. Response was
made by Colonel N. B. Bradbury ol
Medford, colonel of the reunion as
sociation. A good crowd was pres
ent. In honor of the veterans, first
company Coast Artillery Corps gave
an exhibition drill and inspection,
the work being conducted by First
Lieutenant Donald Spencer and First
Sergeant Millard Grubb. Miss Berna
Haight gave piano selections and the
large audience sang "America." The
program was followed by a reception
and the serving of refreshments in
the mess room.
Programs were given Tuesday af
ternoon and evening at Chautauqua
tabernacle. The afternoon event
opening with the singing of "Star
Spangled Banner" by the audience.
Mrs. Margarite Provorse of Portland,
an accomplished reader, gave a pleas
ing selection and Miss Jeanne Ander
son of Ashland sang. The address
was by Prof. I. E. Vinlng and was
a splendid effort.
The evening program consisted of
"Marching Through Georgia" by the
audience, two numbers by the Ash
land Choral Society, readings by Mrs.
Provorse, Dick Posey, and Bonlce Jen
nings and a talk by R. C. Market.,
commandant at the Soldiers' Home in
Roseburg.
Wednesday morning was spent
with story-telling.
Wednesday afternoon C. B. Watson
of Ashland and H. A. Canaday of
Medford spoke at a well attended
meeting at the Chautauqua building.
Wednesday evening, with the best
attendance of the encampment, th
Medford folks put on a program both
interesting and enjoyable, following
which the band concert attracted
many. The Vining Theatre was also
opened to the veterans on Wednes
day evening.
Central Point Is to have a program
tonight and Grants Pass will conduct
the programs tomorrow.
Remodeling Room
In City Building
With Frank Jordan doing the heav
iest part of the heavy work, the busi
ness ot remodeling the old jail room
in the city ball Into commodious,
well-lighted office quarters for the
Commercial Club, was commenced
Monday morning. Mr. Jordan got
back from his vacation just In time
to learn that his bid was the lowest
and hence most acceptable to the city
council, and has plunged into the re
modeling work with a vim which
promises early completion. The
room will be lighted through a big
plate glass window, the aperture for
which is being chiseled out of the
brick. The Interior will be plastered,
wainscoted, floored and finished in
tan and walnut stain. A lavatory
will be established at the rear. Mayor
Johnson is especially pleased over
the inauguration of the work, which
he says will "complete the remodel
ing of the city hall" which was first
commenced as the mayor's pet
project about three years ago.

pulpits of the city or that there will
be a large meeting in the Chautau

will stop this side of Portland, in
Oregon. .
Business Men Vote
To Close Stores
x
The Business Men's Association
met last Monday evening at the Com
mercll Club rooms with a good at
tendance. It was decided to close
the stores of the city on Friday at
ternoon, beginning at 1 o'clock, on
account of Ashland day at the Jack
son county fair. The selling of Ash
land badges to raise funds for the
expense of the band at the fair was
discussed. A business man's and
farmers' picnic was also discussed.
Ford Sees Park
While Train Waits
No hurrahs, no brass band, no
crowds. Just an ordinary quiet day
In Ashland one of the perfect days
of which we have had so many In the
past two weeks. A man who Is
ranked as one of America's greatest;
a mechanical and business genius, a
leader in world movements, many
times a millionaire, slipped quietly
Into Ashland, unheralded and unan
nounced. Henry Ford became en
amored of the city from his private
car and was so anxious to see more
that in his slippers and bareheaded
he eagerly accepted an invitation to
ride through Ashland's Lithla park
and over the scenic drives of the city,
The train was held here for half an
hour while Mr. Ford was taken over
the city. Ashland scored with him
and scored heavily. "By George, if
It wasn't for my being In my slippers
I would stay two weeks. I hope we
miss the train," he exclaimed. And
again later: "Say, that water sure
Is fine. I'll bet I have drunk two
gallons," referring to the lithla wa
ter. Lithla park he described as
"the most wonderful beauty spot 1
have run across on the entire trip."
While, on the invitation of F. L,
Camps, George Kramer and H. 0
Frohbach, Mr. Ford was riding over
the city in a Ford runabout driven
by Mr. Camps, his family and the
rest of the party admired the view
from the depot platform, drank:
llthla water and plied Mr.' Frohbach
with a rapid fire series of questions
concerning the city and adjacent
country. The party Is "taking it
easy," according to Mr. Ford. He
says this Is his vacation and that his
idea of a vacation is to be left alone.
Hence the fact that the Ford party
stayed only two hours . in Portland
The children of the party wore barer
foot sandals and simple gingham
dresses, much unlike the daughters
of the ordinary rich eastern tourist.
Mr.1 Kord himself is a man who
would stand out in a crowd any
where. Of medium height and light
build, grayish hair, smooth shaven
and dressed in a gray suit, until the
observer sees his face no out of the
ordinary Impressions are recorded
But one look at that "live" face, with
constant changes which dimly indl
cate the rapid fire workings of his
brain, and the flashing eyes of genius
mark him as. a man who does things
With all his prominence, and Mr.
Ford has perhaps become one of the
most sought after men of the age, he
Is plain and unassuming, natural and
unaffected.
Perfectly Good
Cane For Sale
Mr. D. Looney called at the Tld
lngs office this morning with a bot
tle of lithia water in his pocket, and
offered his cane for sale. He said:
I..
I don't need It any more. Until
j about nine days ago I was in bed
with rheumatism as bad as a man
could have it without It killing him.
Ponce de Leon started in the right
direction but didn't go far enough."
Mr. Looney came from McMinnvllle
about ten days or two weeks ago and
Is now able to walk all the time, al
though when he first arrived he
could hardly stand. He commenced
at once to drink lithla water ana
drinks lots of it. He says that "the
water or the climate or something"
Is responsible for his Improvement
and he wants to stay in southern
Oregon. ' ' " ,
The total value of gold, Bllver, cop
per, lead and zinc in California in
1915 was $32,263,844 an increase

to figures given out by the Jnlted

Plan Picnic For
Farmers and-City
At the Monday evening meeting
of the Ashland Business Men's Asso
ciation considerable discussion was
heard of a picnic of the business men
and the farmers of the surrounding
district. No definite plans were laid,
but a committee consisting of
Messrs. F, F. Whittle, T. W. Acklln
and H. P. Holmes was appointed to
Investigate and If found feasible a
special meeting of the association
will be called and plans laid for a
big affair.

President William Sproule of the
Southern Pacific, and General Man
ager Scott of the same company, ar
rived in Ashland from San Francisco
Tuesday in a special train and spent
an hour Tuesday afternoon in. Lithla
park.
They walked through the park,
drank mineral water and enjoyed the
sunshine which they proclaimed a
great change from the. fogs of the
bay region.
Mr. Sprolue expressed great amaze- I
ment at the wonderful growth and j
Increasing beauty of the park, and
repeated time and again that there Is
no question but that there will be
a great report here.
Advance information as to style
of dances for the coming winter In
dicates that the freak steps, twists
and glides have passed the zenith of
their popularity and in their stead
will come dances of a more decorus
and modest nature. Probably they
will be just as healthful and elicit
just as much enthusiasm as a few of
the extreme movements which are
passing, Ilk othfcf5city fads, into
desirable oblivion.
Stores and Schools Close Friday
Afternoon for Ashland Day at Fair
The stores of the city will close at t
1 o'clock tomorrow (Friday) and the1

should wear an Ashland badge and
display an Ashjand pennant If a car
i owner, several thousand people win

Bandmen Report
Great Outing
The last straggling member of the
Ashland band arrived from the wilds
of Curry county at midnight last Sat
urday. The trip to the coast, the
Chetco Cove Carnival, the entertain
ment provided for the band boys,
the beauties of the Chetco river
country, all contributed toward a
"time" which will always be treas
ured in the memories of the band
men who made the trip. Owing to
the demands of their businesses only
about half of the local bandmen
were ablo to make the trip, and the
band was filled up to twenty pieces
by additions of the best musicians
from Medford, Central Point, MarBh
fleld and Crescent City. Dubbed
"Loveland's All Stars" by one of the
Medford players, the band was such
an organization as is Beldom gath
ered except for long professional en
gagements, and the music furnished
at the Chetco Carnival was of a class
seldom heard outside of the largest
cities. And the band boys who were
brought together all turned out to
lie royal good fellows as well, and
Brookings was left behind with the
deepest regret.
At Brookings a group of forty men
staged the Chetco Cove Carnival at
an expense which totaled several
thousand dollars, the music alone
costing well over eight hundred. An
outdoor dance hall, which was as
near perfect as anything of the kind
could be, was erected at a cost of
several hundred dollars. The town
of Brookings, which is laid out on
a metropolitan plan, anticipating the
city which will some day grow up
there, has a race track and a ball
grounds, ' a tourist hotel which a
large city would be proud of, and
every facility for entertaining the
hundreds who motored in from the
surrounding country and from points
hundreds of miles away. Excellent
races were staged. Ball games be
tween Medford and Brookings were
as good baseball as is ever seen in
this valley. The crowd was a Jolly
yet well behaved gathering and the
carnival a success. The Ashland
band was the hit of the affair and
nothing was too good for the band
boys. The carnival men plan to try
to' get the Ashland band next year
for the carnival, which Is to be made
an annual event. Going even fur
ther, the Brookings folks are active
ly trying to Induce a number of the
ets to the fair In the afternoon.
There will also be several privately
managed dances, a " 52 Camp" and
other features staged downtown la
the evenings.
Exhibits.
The livestock, farm machinery and
agrlcultuial exhibits are housed at
the fair grounds. The women's and
children's exhibits, fancy work, men
chants' exhibits, Industrial, etc., are
housed in a downtown building oppo
site the Medford Furniture Corn
pany's building. Any Medford citi
zen wllj direct you to It. Admission
to both Is included for the one price.
Ashland Shines.
D. M. Lowe of Ashland has organ-
I ized the connty jto ten districts in
iIne wIth hlg work aa superintendent
0f entries. All but two of these dla-
trlcts were In yesterday noon when
a Tidings reporter visited the fair.
Applegate and Phoenix districts were
still missing hut were expected to
come in during the afternoon. Of
all the entries the Ashland district
far outshines the others in point of
size and general appearance and
seems to stand excellent chances of
carrying off the district prize. Mr.
Lowe himself has a wonderful ex
hibit of products most artistically
arranged. In the Ashland exhibit a
number of local growers are repre
sented, as In every other department.
The raln display is one hundred
times as large as last year and every
other department far exceeds any at
tempt of the past. The livestock ex
hibits a it well worth seeing, and t he
fact that the Rogue River valley Is
one of the pasture spots as well as
garden spots of Oregon Is well ex
emplified. Over sixty entiles were
in, In the rabbit and poultry depart
ment, and additional pens were 'be
ing built. The downtown exhibit
contains a myriad of things of inter
est to women and men alike and'
should by no means be overlooked.
To Form Branch of
Hughes Alliance
Walter L. Tooze, Sr., state organ
izer for the National Hughes Alli
ance, arrived In Ashland yesterday
accompanied by a number of the
prominent Hughes boosters of the
valley and spoke at an Informal gath
ering of Hughes supporters held In?
the Commercial Club rooms yester
day afternoon. City Chairman?
Thomas H. Simpson presided over
the meeting, at which plans were laid
for a big Hughes rally to be held in
the Chautauqua building on Friday,
September 22, at which a local
branch of the Hughes Alliance will
be organized. A committee consist
ing of E. D. BrlggB, E. V. Carter and
O. F. Carson was appointed to ar
range a program for the rally and
are already arranging preliminary
plans which point toward a meeting
the like of which has seldom been
seen In Ashland. It Is understood
that they are negotiating for several
prominent speakers, the Ashland
band and other features. Every sup
porter of Hughes for president Is ex
pected to take a big part in making
the coming meeting a record breaker
and the Ashland branch of the
Hughes Alliance one of the biggest
in the state.
Mr. Tooze will be here, as will a
number of other prominent men of
the state, on Friday evening of next
week. The state organizer expressed
himself as most highly pleased with,
the enthusiasm which he found In
Jackson county and predicts a big
Hughes majority.
