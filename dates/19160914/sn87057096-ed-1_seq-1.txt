KILLED BY COLT'S KICK..
Mrs. W. A. Moore, of Eden Jownship,
Died Tuesday from Injuries.
Mrs. W. A. Moore, residing about
seven miles southeast of Leon in
Eden township, died at 4 o'clock
Tuesday morning, the result of being
kicked in the abdomen by a colt the
previous morning. In company with
her husband Mrs. Moore was in the
barnyard, when a good big colt kick
ed at her, its hoofs striking her in
the upper abdomen with great force.
She was rendered unconscious by the
blow, and was carried to the house by
her husband, and Dr. Wailes, of Da
vis City, summoned. She remained
unconscious until after the physician
reached the house, and he found that
she wqs in a very serious condition
and anmmoned Dr. Layton of Leon,
to assist him. It was found that the
blow had caused a rupture of blood
vessels, and as Mrs. Moore was a
very delicate woman, she was in no
condition to stand an operation until
she recovered from the shock. She
continued to fail during the day and
passed away Tuesday morning about
4 o'clock. She is survived by her
husband ancl four children. The en-

the largest crowd in attendance this
year that was ever assembled in De

ayne County Had Splendid Fair.
We took a half day off last Thurs-.'
day and visited the Wayne county
fair held at Corydon last week, and
we were sufprised at both the big
ness of the fair and the bigness of
the crowds. Corydon used to have a
fair association, but the last fair
was held nineteen years ago. The
past year they organized a new fair
association, sold about $14,000
worth of stock, bought new fair
grounds, erected a fine grand stand,
and other buildings, and their efforts
were crowned with success. During
the three days of the fair moro than
35,000 people passed through the
gates,. and more .than 2,000 autos
were on tne ground each day. They
expended about $'20,000 on the new
grounds and buildings, and offered
$65,000 in premiums. The receipts
for the fair were over $12,000, so
they are in fine shape financially.
They had fine track races each day,
with a big string of trotters, pacers
and runners, and the races were the
best ever seen in southern Iowa.
Aeroplane flights and auto polo were
among the attractions, and the ex
hibits of live stock and farm products
were very fine. All who attended
the fair were more than pleased with
it, and the success of the fair next:
year is assured.
Many Decatur county people at-l
tended the fair, and we have Jheard
many of our farmers and business^
men 'express the wish that Decatur
county could again have a fair. The:
county fair seems to be coming baclt
again.
One well known farmer told uA
that he would either take stock in a'
fair association or make a clean do
nation of $100 if a fair association^:
was organized. We believe that if
the matter was taken up that i£
would be an easy matter to dispose
of enough stocK among the farmers
and citizens of Leon to have a fair
at Leon next year. All the project
needs is for a few good boosters to
take it up like they did at Corydon,
and it can be pushed, through.
Let's have a Decatur county fair
next year. v^
