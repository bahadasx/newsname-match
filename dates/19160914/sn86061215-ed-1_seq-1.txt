Five Thousand Polling Place®.
Chicago, Sept. 13 —Their campaigns
for nomination completed, republican
and democratic candidates at the Illi
nois state primary today waited for
the count of ballots which will mean
success or defeat for them.
While there has been a spirited con
test over virtually every state office
nomination, the struggle for the repub
lican gubernatorial nomination to a
large degree overshadowed the others.
This was a three cornered battle be
tween Frank O. Lowden of Oregon,
111., backed by the regular republican
organisation in Cook county and the
state State Senator Morton D. Hull of
Chicago, championed by the faction
led by Former Gov. Charles S. De
neen and Frank L. Smith of Dwight,
who worked independently.
Predictions of victory were issued
at the headquarters of each of the
three candidates while the votes were
being oast
The expense of the primary cam
paign, estimated to exoeed by many
thousand dollars all previous pri
maries was further evidenced by the
number of workers on duty in the
5,369 voting precincts in the state.
Gov. Dunne, opposed for the dem
ocratic nomination for chief state ex
ecutive by William Brlnton of Dixon,
asserted that he had no fear of defeat
through the eleventh hour endorse
ment of his rival by the Sullivan fac
tion and the regular Cook county dem
ocratic organization.
One man on the state ticket, Patrick
J. Lucey, attorney general of Illinois,
was unmindful of. hopes and fears as
he was unopposed for renomination
on the democratic ticket. Various con
gressional and legislative candidates
on both the democratic and republican
tickets were In the same situation.
Charles B. Fuller, republican congress

DUE TO HUGHES
Official Washington Admits
G. O. P. Candidate Turned
the Tide for His Party
Washington, D. C., Sept. 13.—The
staff correspondent of The Chicago
Tribune is authority for the following
summary of the results of the repub
lican victory In the Maine elections
of Monday:
Official Washington passed the great
er part of the day sizing up the results
of the election in Maine Monday.
The view generally taken here is
that the victory is indicative of an
even greater sweep by the republi
cans In November.
One feature of the election which
astounded administration officials was
the vote of the Maine guardsmen on
the Texas border. The soldiers voted
overwhelmingly against the democratlo
ticket and in favor of the republican**
As & O. P. Views Reault
The outstanding features of the eleo
tion, according to republicans, are:
1—It indicates a reunion of the
progressives with the republicans
and a reunited republican party
with straightway progressive lead
ership by Hughes.
2—It demonstrates that demo
crats will have to abandon their
slogan that "a vote for me is a
vote for Wilson," and will have to
do something to bolster up the presi
dent's popularity throughout the
country.
3—It proves the opportunism of
Mr. Wilson has failed to attract
the young voters of the country or
ensnare many former progres
sives, Inasmuch as the total repub
lican vote was greater than the
combined progressive and repub
lican vote in 1912.
4—It proves beyond a doubt that
in surrendering to the railway/
brotherhood a few weeks ago Mr.
Wilson created a political issue
which he and his party cannot
dodge between now and election.
From Democratlo Viewpoint.
The democratic view on the other
hand, is still quite haxy. None of the
leaders seems to be able to explain
the defeat of Senator Johnson or the
downfall of Representative McGillicnd
dy. The election of both was practical
ly conceded by the republicans In ad
vance. Only a few of the democratic
officials would discuss the election.
Their views In the concrete are:
1—That the progressives in
Maine went back to the republican
party.
2—VThat the shipping trust inter
ests in the state, resenting the en
actment of the ship purchase law,
used Influence and money against
the democrats.
3—That the enemies of the
Adamson eight hour law and anti
labor capitalists generally devoted
time and nyoney to the republican
cause.
Says Hughes Turned Tide.
Both democrats and republicans ad
mitted that Hughes' criticism of the
president's surrender to the railway
brotherhoods in the strike situation
turned the tide against Wilson and
against the democratic ticket general
ly.
The republicans assert that Mr.
Hughes, seizing upon the issue and
hammering his arguments home in an
incomparable way. clearly demonstrat
ed the opportunism of the president
and convinced the independent voters
of Maine they belonged in the repub
lican party.
With regard to the reunion of the
progressives and republicans, the
democrats asserted that local condi
tions in Maine were responsible for
an amalgamation which will not be
effected in other states. Republicans
here contend the amalgamation will
go through elsewhere Just as in Maine,
and that all states which before 1912,
including New York, Indiana and Ohio,
were normally republican, will be re
publican this year.
"LICKED," CHAMP CLARK SAY8.
Joplin, Mo., Sept.

STREET CAR COMPANIES
Offer of New York Public Service
Commission to Settle 8trlke Falls
to G®t Results.
New York, Sept. 13.—Th® Interbor
ough Rapid Transit and the New York
Railways Co. formally rejected today
the public service commission's rec
ommendation for a strike settlement
made yesterday.
The two companies, controlling the
subway, elevated and "green car" sur
face lines, declined to hold further con
ferences with representatives of th6
union and announced that it is their
Intention to continue to operate their
lines on the present basis.
But few surface cars were operated
today and passengers were forced to
use the subways and elevated roads.
Congestion at express stations was ex
treme.
There was little or no violence dur
ing the night, largely due to the fact
that policemen were stationed on roof
tops where attacks had been made on
elevated trains.
Hugh Frayne, state organizer of the
American Federation of Labor, an
nounced today that between 12,000 and
20,000 men will take part in a parade
and demonstration tomorrow.
Mayor Mitchel, it developed today,
has under consideration two methods
of settling the strike. One is to re
quest Gov. Whitman to call a special
session of the legislature to pass a
law compelling both sides to accept
arbitration, while the other proposes
the immediate granting of a franchise
to the New York Motor Bus Co., In
corporated, to run machines through
certain streets.
BAKERS TO SHOW BOOKS
Chicago Authorities Will Be Given
Figures To Justify Proposed Ad

Chicago, Sppt. 13. —Announcement
was made today that bakers who
maintain they must increase the price
of bread or face bankruptcy will be
given an opportunity to show Charles
F. Clyne, TJ. S. district attorney, the
figures to support their assertions.
They may produce their books for ex
amination by government experts, it
was said.
Mrs. Julian Heath, president of the
National Housewives' league expected
today to cooperate in an investigation
of conditions which brought about the
increase proposal.
"We don't know yet who is respons
ible for the proposed Increase," said
Mrs. Heath after a conference with
Mr. Clyne. "Members of the league
In all parts of the country are gather
ing information concerning the pres
ent situation.
"Bakers everywhere tell the same
story that the increase in the cost
of ingredients makes the increase nec
essary. It may be that the demand
for wheat abroad is the original cause
of all the trouble. In such a case, un
less there Is an embargo, we will have
to teach women how to get the most
out of the ten cent loaf of bread."
CAPTAINS ACCUSED
i-
OF LOSING HORSES
San Antonio, Tex., Sept. 13.—A re
quest that Captains J. H. Walrath and
Fred W. Laas, quartermasters respec
tively of the first and second Illinois
regiments of Infantry, be returned
here for court martial, was sent to
the war department at Washington by
Maj. Gen. Funston.
It is charged they were guilty of ne
glect of duty in caring for government
property by losing some fifty horses
and mules valued at about $15,000 be
longing to the U. S. army.
The lost animals were among oth
ers turne!| over to the two regiments
when they came south. Receipts
were given by the quartermasters. It
is not known what became' of the
horses and mules.
Gen. Funston said he would prose
cute every supply officer in the ser
vice guilty of this sort of negligence.
"If the practice continues the gov
ernment will lose huge sums of mon
ey," he added.
The general explained that prompt
action In this Instance was necessary
in order that other regimental quarter
masters may be convinced of the ne
cessity of an accounting for all gov
ernment property in their possession
when they prepare to return nortji
again.
Captains Walrath and Lass are still
in the federal service as their regi
ments, although among those recently
returned north, have not been mus
tered out.

much as the Morrell packing plant,
where it would seem that construction
of one kind or another has been under
way almost continuously. In fact
there is some type of building or al
teration always under way at the im
mense plant in the east end.
This year, however, an unusual
amount of constructive improvement
has been under way and is still un
finished although some of the work
1B almost completed. In the building
carried on at the packing plant this
summer hundreds of thousands of
brick have been used. Thousands of
sacks of cement and thousands of
specially made tile, the latter for the
massive new smoke stack that towers
more than 200 feet in the air.
Massive 8moke Stack.
The new stack is especially con
structed of tile that Is filled with con
crete and reinforced by iron rods, both
upright and encircling the layers of
tile. The whole construction rests
upon a massive concrete base or found
ation!
that has many hundreds of bags
of cement used in its construction.
The stack towers 200 feet and four
inches high and an Iron ladder runs
up both outside and inside the huge
chimney. For sixty feet from its base
a second or Inner chimney Is erected
to protect the stack proper from the
intense heat as It comes direct from
beneath the boilers. The inside space
at the bottom measures seventeen
feet and three Inches In diameter and
graduates down to eleven feet at the
top. The great height and interior
size of the stack gives it immense
draft to aid the big furnaces beneath
the boilers that supply steam power
to the plant. This work is merely an
addition to an already large power
plant or plantB for the energy used
to make the electricity and supply the
huge ^amount of steam needed at the
big concern requires two power sta
tions of which the work being com
pleted Is hut an addition to the second
plant.
New Boiler Room.
The new boiler room is 40x60 and
when completed will be equipped with
two boilers that will furnish an addi
tional 1,000 horse power to the already
big power capacity. This building is
an addition btoilt on to the east end
of the power house located near the
beef plant. Room is provided for fu
ture additions in the way of boilers as
those to be installed will not take up
but a small portion of the building and
the new stack will accommodate sev
eral more boilers.
Install Big Engine.
The new engine room is 60x60 and
located on the south and west of the
power house making an of the build
ing, the large stack being in between
the two hew additions. The engine
room is very massive and tons of
heavy structural steel are used in its
construction because of the immense
weight of the engine and its various
parts that are carried In the building
and the coll? of piping on the roof that
are used in process of condensing the
ammonia and making the refrigera
tion. The big engine Just Installed
but which is not yet ready for use, Is
the biggest machine of any kind in
these parts and is known as the Ball
Giant ice machine and (compressor,
having an Ice making capacity of 500
tons dally. Some idea of the magni
tude of the massive machipe may he
gleaned when it is known that the
present ice making or chilling capac
ity of the packing plant is now 750
tons dally and the new engine will in
crease it to 1.25Q tons. Many tons of
concrete were used In building the
foundation for the engine alone and
although the work has been in prog
ress all summer, it is probable that
snow will be falling before the entire
new plant will be In operation.
Numerous other construction jobs
have been under way this summer at
the big packing plant, but the new
Jmprovement
tower additions have been the chief
and have supplied a
large amount of work to local labor.

VILLA IS REPORTED IN
TRIPLET BY HIS FOES
Mexican Bandit Chief Expeoted to Ex
perience Great Difficulty In Trying
to Effect Escape.
Chihuahua City, Mex., \«pt. 18.—
With the troops of Gen. HuerVa Vangas
posted along the line of the Mexican
Central railway ready to head off any
attempt of the Villa troops to escape
in that direction, Gen. Cavazos, push
ing northeast with his command from
Namiquipa, and the American expedi
tionary force forming the third section
of the circle, Gen. Trevlno states here
that Villa is now in a position from
which It will be extremely difficult to
escape.
The American expedition has forces
at San Buena Ventura and Carmen, on
the lookout for the bandits.
San Buena Ventura is on the main
wagon road to the Central Railway and
gives the Americans the control of the
only easy exit for Villa from his pres
ent position into northwest Chihuahua.
VILLA NOT-LOCATED.
San Antonio, Tex., Sept. 13.—Gen.
Pershing today sent a message to Gen.
Funston In which he said no new
traces of Francisco Villa had been
discovered either by his patrols or the
Carranzistas.
The trip was one of the longest in
time and mileage ever taken by a
presidential nominee. Mr. Hughes left
here on the night of August 5 and
traveled thirty-nine days. His Itin
erary took him from Portland, Me., to
San Diego, Cal., from Canada to with
in sight of the Mexican border. He
visited twenty-five states, spoke at all
the chief centers of population in the
country, exclusive of the south, and
including the capitals of ten states,
and traveled 11,484 miles by ^rttil. In
addition he averaged more than 400
miles a week by motor, or about 2,600
miles, making the total mileage of his
trip approximately 14,000 miles.
His trip was made over fifteen rail
road systems. Since his departure
from New York, Mr. Hughes has un
dergone almost every sort of experi
ence that usually befalls a candidate,
and many out of the ordinary. He
donned a miner's togs at Butte and
went 3,000 feet down into the mine,
climbed mountains more than 12,000
feet high, attended county and state
fairs and a national exposition, and
spoke from almost every sort of plat
form, including the rostrum of the
great Mormon tabernacle in Salt Lake
City. He made 141 speeches and was
photographed thousands of times.
Mr. Hughes reached New York in
good health and spirits. He will rest
four days at Bridgehampton and then
will start on a trip that will last, with
only one break of two days, until elec
tion day.
BLISS WITH MEDIATORS
Staff Officer To Advise With Conferees
Over Solution Of The Various
Border Problems.
New London, Conn., Sept. 13. —With
the arrival here today of Maj. Gen.
Bliss from Washington, American
members of the joint international
commission prepared to take up again
the questions of devising an adequate
system of policing the Mexican bound
ary.
The conferences have taken up,
while awaiting Gen. Bliss, outlines ot
economic and political conditions In
Mexico. In presenting the latter re
view yesterday. Lute Cabrera, head of
the Mexican commission, drew atten
tion to the progress the Carranza
government had made.
In January, 1915, he said, the Car
ranza forces controlled only a fringe
of states along the gulf coast and a
few ports on the weBt. The remainder
of the country "was in the hands of
Villa and Zapata and their followers.
Since Gen. Carranza today faces only
scattered outlaw hands and there Is
nothing approaching organized mili
tary opposition to his rule throughout
the country, his representatives appar
ently feel Justified in predicting that
complete order soon will be reestab
lished.
