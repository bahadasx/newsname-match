WAR NOT ENDING-FROM FINANCIAL STANDPOINT
"When the European war began, many financiers thought it could not
go on longer than six months on account of the tremendous expenditures.
It has been In progress more than two years now and the end is not yet
from a financial standpoint," H. A. Bruce of New York Ytold the Rotary
Club at lunch today Mr. Bruce, who. Is a representative of the great finan
cial house of N. W. Halsey & Co. of New York, Chicago and San Fran
cisco, gave the local Rota rians one of the most interesting talks they have
ever heard. He told of three war loans of especial Interest and the meth
ods by : which they were floated in the United States. He pointed out that
the tremendous borrowing achivements of the Allies and also that the Cen
tral Powers are sustaining their expenditures through borrowing: fron
their own people His conclusion was that so far as finances are con
cerned, the conflict can go on for some time yet that there Is no definite

A. L Castle, Returning Froni
Mainland, Tells of Chance to
v Get Meet of Champions
"" :-' j' ', ' r? '
R. Norrls Williams II, champion
tennis player of America, may come
to Honolulu for the Hawaiian tens Is
championships: George Church, who
has had a great year with the racquet
may also be induced to come here.
Church is a former Princeton player
and was the man who put Ichiya Ku
magae, the great Japanese tennis
player, out of the running. This news
was brought by, A. L., Castle, who has
just returned from a tour of the east
ern tournaments. ;; j
It arrangements can be made, with
the Tokio Tennis Association Kuma
gae will also be given an opportunity
to meet the stars here. If these three
noted tennis players come here, Ha
waii will have an opportunity of stag
ing the greatest tournament In his
tory. " r- f. .. .
Castle Plays in East . "-
Castle paid a visit to all the big
tournaments throughout the East and
took part in a number of the matches.
His record wa? a good one and al
though he .failed to win the .finals In
any tourney, was runner up on a num
ber of , occasions. His visit has natu
rally been a big boost for Hawaii, and
tennis folk on the mainland in - the
future will be given a clearer' idea
of the style of tennis played here.
"Williams will no doubt be 'ranked
No. 1 this year," said Castle, "He
has played great tennis and potenti
ally is the greatest player in America,
Johnston also continued", his : great
match, but in the championship Wil
liams was at his best and : scored a
hard-fougnt victory, over the young
Calif orn lan. .
Comet Not Ranked
"Maurice McLoughlin will not be
ranked this year as he has not played
in the required number of tourna
ments. His play was not up to the
standard of the past year. Church
will be well up in the ranking, and
Kumagae is certain to be ranked high
this year. '
"Among the new players who . may
receive a chance in the first ten are
Harold Throckmorton, Joseph Arm
strong, and Wiilis Davis. Strachan
and Murray, wha were not ranged last
year, will perhaps be given considera
tion In the first ten.

(AMoit4 Preas by Federal Wtrelew) J
CHICAGO, ' I1U Sept- 14.r-Former
U. S. Senator William. Lorimer,, dis
graced and Imprisoned as the result
of alleged political corruption and
bank-wrecking, has failed in his ef
fort to Vcome back" by getting the
Republican nomination to Congress.
He has conceded his defeat in the
primaries yesterday, Arthur Fulton
winning. A feature of the Illinois elec
tion was that less than 14 per cent
of the registered women voters cast
their ballots. 1
Governor Duane was renominated
by the Democrats . without opposition
of a really serious nature, by a plural
ity of 150,000 votes while the Republi
can nominee, Frank O. Lowden, will
receive at least that number for his
plurality, if the early figures on the
returns are supported by the later
ones. ' "
Representative James R. Mann. Re
publican house leader, was renominat
ed with little' opposition. :
William Mason and Representative
Burnett Chiperfield are believed to
have won the Republican' nomination
in their respective districts against
keen competition, while the . Demo
crats have named Representative Wil
