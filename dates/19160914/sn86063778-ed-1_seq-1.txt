Reunion of Republican and Progressive
Parties Marked.?State Legislature
Falls Wholly Under Control of thRepublicans.
?
Portland. Maine.?Indications are
that the Republicans have, won the
state election by safe pluralities.
If the ratio of the Republican marKin
Is maintained. Carl R. Killikin will
be elected governor by about 11,000
plurality.
Bert M. Feniald, Republican, seems
to have been elected for the short
term in the United States Senate and
the same ratio of gain would Kive him
a plurality of 9,600.
United States Senator Charles F.
Johnson. Democrat, apparently has
been defeated by Frederick Hale, by
an indicated plurality of 7.500
If the Republican congressional
candidates hold the lead they, had at
latest report, three. Louis B. Goodall,
in the First District. Congressman
John A. Peters in the Third, and Ira G.
Ilerzy in the Fourth are elected. Congressman
Daniel J. McGillicuddy,
Democrat, appeared to have been defeated
in the Second district by Wallace
II. White, but this ficht was close.
The total vote may prove to have
been the largest ever cast In the
state.
The election was the culmination ,
of one of the hottest debts ever waged
1n the state and marked the reunion
of the Republican and Progressive parties,
whose differences in 1U12 gave
the electoral vote of Maine to President
Wilson and two years later resulted
in the election of Governor Oakley
C. Curtis, a Democrat, by a plurality
of 3.189. Tonight's figures indicate
that the larger percentage of the
Progressive vote which two years a~o
was 1S.22G. was cast for the Republi^
can ticket.
Throughout the campaign in which
a great number of men from all parts
of the country and drawn from Republican.
I>emocrats and Progressives participated.
National issues were kept to
the forefront. The interest aroused together
with perfect election weather,
brought out one of the biggest votes
ever east in the state and possibly
greater than has been known before.

his attack on President Samuel
Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor, during debate on the
Owen />rrupt practice bill In the
senate, declaring the labor leader and
Postmaster General Burleson were
the two most prominent figures on
! the Democratic side of the Presiden|
tial campaign. Mr. Gompers. he said,
; was to deliver the 2,000,000 labor
votes to the Democrats while Mr.
Burleson used the postmasters of the
country "to fry fat" for it.
Senator Sherman quoted from a
Texas newspaper of 1009 to show
that Mr. Burleson then was part
owner of a ranch where hundreds of
convict laborers wore employed. In
1911, he said, the foreman of the
ranch was tried for causing the death
of a negro convict who had been
whipped, but was acquitted and in
1913 was appointed postmaster at
Longview, Texas.

south of the River, drove their men

railway junction town of Chaulttes to
Rove, between Chaulttes and Chilly.
To the north, operations of the
French with Rarloux, and ultimately
Peronne as their objective, also met
with success. Southeast of Belloyen-Santerre

Washington. Adjournment of Congress
was quickly followed by a general
exodus of members hastening
homeward for rest or the national
political campaign.
While '.he rinsing saw the administration
legislative program mainly
completed some things wait to be
"ontinued at the winter session notably
the remainder of the president's program
of railroad legislation which vras
partially enacted to prevent the threatened
strike, in a formal statement ,
President Wilson speaking of the work
of Congress, gave notice that the remainder
of the railroad program would
l>e pressed at the new session.
The president's statement was as
follows:
"A very remarkable session of Con
gross has just closed, full, as all re
cont sessions of the Congress have
been of helpful and humane legislation
which constitutes contributions of capital
importance to the defense, the economic
progress and the wholesome life
of the country.
"It is to he regretted that the session
could not have continued long
enough to complete the program recently
project oil with regard to the accommod'tiMon
of lal>or disputes lw?tween
the railways and the employ s,
but it was not feasible in the circumstances
to continue the session any
longer and therefore only the most immediately
pressing narts of the program
could be completed.
"The rest, it is agreed, has merely
been postponed until it can lie more
nvatnre'y deliberated and perfected. 1
I have every reason to believe that it
is the purpose of the leaders of tho
two houses immediately upon the re- '
assembling of Congress to undertake
tliis additional legislation. It is evident
that the country should be relieved
of the anxiety which must have
been created by recent events with regard
to the future accommodation of
such disputes."
