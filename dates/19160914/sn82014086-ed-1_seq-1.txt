The French troops north of Peronne
are holding tenaciously to the salient
they have driven into the German line
eastward of the Bethune-Peronne
road near Bouchavesnes. They also
hold intact the town of Bouchavesnes
and other points along the line cap
tured In the offensive which they
started Tuesday. In addition a pow
erfully organized German trench sys
tem south of the Le Priez farm, near
the road running1 west from Rancourt
to Combles, has been captured, plac
ing Combles in further jeopardy. The
fighting in the region of Bouchaves
nes has been sanguinary. Finding
that the trench had cut their line of
communication from Peronne north
ward the Germans threw violent at
tacks against l'Abbe wood and Hill
76, south of Bouchavesnes, and suc
ceeded in recapturing both places.
The French, however, returned vic
iously to the attack and after hard
fighting, some of it hand-to-hand, fi
nally drove out the Germans and kept
the gTound they had won. In the two
days' lighting more than Z,300 Ger
mans were taken prisoners and a
large number of guns and machine
EU'iri captured.
On that part of the Somme front,
held by the British the situation re
mains unchanged. South of the
Somme heavy artillery duels between
the French and Germans continue in
the region of Vermandovillers and
Chaulnes. A repulse of a German at
tack near Fleury, in the Verdun sec
tion, is reported by Paris.
All along the Macedonian front
heavy fighting continues but no im
portant changes in positions have
bee.i reported. The Italians have
joined in the fray west of the Vardar
river. Near Lake Butkovo they are
declared by Rome to have driven
Bulgarian detachments beyond the
Demir-Hissar-Doiran road. A Bul
garian official report, however, says
the Italians were dispersed in this re
gion with a loss of thirty men made
prisoners.
The British who are across the
Struma river south of Lake Taklnos
have made no further efforts to ad
vance and In that region there have
been no new developments.
In the Dobrudja region of Rumania
the operations by the forces of the
central powers are going on methodi

Austrians near Hermannstadt and
southeast of Hoetzing in the fighting
against the invading Rumanians.
Up in the Carpathians Russian at
tacks along the entire front have been
repulsed, according to statements of
both Vienna and Berlin. Petrosrad
says the Russians are holding all the
gTound they have won in this region.
German aeroplanes have sunk a
Russian torpedo boat destroyer In the
Gulf of Riga and attacked Russian na

al liberal member of th richstag, ad
voctlng, among othr things, a resump

Ambassador uerara is quoted as
saying that he did not understand
how the representatives of districts
for whioh export to America was a vi
tal question could advocate ruthless
submarine warrare. The national
liberal press agency, in a communi
cation to the newspapers, takes tae
ambassador to task ror wnat is term

The paper declares that Ambassador
Gerar.d would do better to leave to the
responsible German authorities the de
cesion on which use is to be made of
the means at their command against
England, and adds:
"The art and manner in which Am
bassador Gerjrd and not for the first
time looks after British interests is
extremely characteristic of his gen
eral attitude."
The American ambassador, In reply,
says that he never heard of Dr. Strese
mann's speech and certainly never
made any public utterance of the na
ture attributed to him. But so far as
his attitude on the submarine issue is
concerned, he declare, it is based -n
pro-American, not pro-British motives.

ALL TRAVEL DELAYED
All Surface Car Lines in Manhattan

During the Day.
New York, Sept. 13. The failure of
Mayor Mitchell and the public ser
vice commission today to induce offi

Groat ' Inconvenience to Public.
With traffic on all surface car lines
In Manhattan and the Bronx com
pletely suspended every night and

more than 75,000 persons tried to get
trains before 8 p. m.

Mayor Mitchell said late today that
something would have to be done im
mediately to relievo the situation and
that he hoped to devise some means
by which cars could run again. The
mayor's plan to have the board of es
timate r.rant a franchise to the Nev
York Motor Bus company, permitting
omnibus traffic throughout the city
did not give much hope tonight, as it
was explained it takes thirty days be
fore the franchise can be granted and
the busses put in operation.

one third of the city indicated.
Frank L. Smith of Dwight, Ills., ran
a poor third in Chicago. Down-state

New London, Conn., Sept. 13. Sug
gestions as to what methods shall be
employed to establish peace on the
Mexican border were submitted today
to Major General Tasker H. Bliss, U.
S. A., by the American memoers oi
the American-Mexican joint commis
sion. The officer's opinions were
sought on subjects ranging from the
wisdom of withdrawing American
troops from Mexico to the possibility
of creating an international police to
guard the border. No conclusion,
however, was reacned oy xne com

Questions of Taxation.
The ioint commission dealt today
wholly with questions raised by tax
ation decrees issued by General Car
ranza which affect American-control-ed
mining properties in Mexico. An
exhaustive study of the situation was
begun which also will be carried on
tomorrow. The Mexican commission
ers explained in detail the purposes
of the decrees and the theories on
which they were- founded, insisting
that they were designed to promote
the mining industry, not to drive out
American capital and confiscate its
holdings.
System of Border Patrol.
In their conference- with General
Bliss the American commissioners
took under consideration the advisa
bility of proposing such a system of
border ipatrol that a portion of the
Mexican troops now engaged in this
duty would be released for the pursuit
of bandits at a distance from the line.
They considered also the attitude of
Americans living along the border, as
reported by General Bliss, and ob
tained from that officer estimates as
to the number of soldiers it would be
necessary to employ to put into ef
fect any of the plans that have been
suggested.

said tonight it was probably unique In

It was possible, he said, that no con

of the things discussed. He added,
however, that the Mexicans, on their
side, would have knowledge of the
views held in the United States as a
result of the deliberations, while the

IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO
WAS HEAVY LAST YEAR
Owing to Deplorable Conditions Re
sulting from Revolutions.
San Antonio. Tex., Sept. 13. More
than 100,000 (Mexican laborers, includ
ing men, women and children, entered
the United States through Texas ports
of entry during tho year ending June
30 last, according to the official re
port of the federal service. On a basis
of immigration from Mexico since June
30, it is estimated the movement from
the southern republic for the present
fiscal year wffl be about 225,000. The
heavy immigration from 'Mexico at this
time is due primarily to the deplorable
condutions accruing from the several
revolutions there.

ties of Mexico were being talked over,
Mr. Lane said, and it was necessary
that all these tihngs should be con

distressed republic.
American Mining Interests.
A statement issued tonight said the
complaints of American -mining In
terests in Mexico had led to the pres
ent investigation! In explaining the
decrees complained of, the Mexican
commissioners pointed out, the state
ment asserted that one of the main
purposes which the Carranza govern
ment had in view was to prevent
speculative and unproductive mono
polization of mining lands by Individ
uals and companies. The Carranza
government, it was said, virtually has
reversed the system whicn was in op
eration during the Diaz regime.
Taxation on Mining Claims.
Under the Diaz plan the rate of
taxation on mining claims diminished
in direct ratio to the number of ,
claims, whereas under the Carranza
plan the purpose is to encourage the
staking of a relatively small number
of claims which will be actually op- - :
erated and to discourage the holding
of large tracts of mining land which
are simply being held for speculative '
punposes.
Paper Currency.
Another series of complaints to :
which the commission directed its at
tention had to do with the attempt on
the part of the Carranza. government
to compel merchants and corporations ;
to accept paper currency at a rate far ;
in excess of its current value. The
attention of the Mexican commission-
ers was called to instances in which
military commanders had, throngh de-
crees, threatened with the death pen
alty any persons who refused to ac
cept paper currency at its par value,
and for a similar offense had also
threatened merchants with the con
fiscation of their property. In deal
ing with these matters the Mexican :
commissioners pointed out that in so
vast a country It was humanly Impos-'
sible to guard against all abuses, but
they laid emphasis on the faot that
while such extreme decrees had been
issued by subordinate military com
manders, the national government has :
constantly urged moderation upon the
state governors and that they had no
record of a single instance in which
anj' of these extreme penalties bad
been inflicted.
