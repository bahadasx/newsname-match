D. 0. BRICHOUX
FOR R. C. GOODWIN'S DEATH
GRAND JURY RETURNS TRUE BILL FOR SECOND
DEGREE MURDER LATE TODAY.
ACCUSED SAYS SHOOTING WAS AN ACCIDENT
City Stirred by Sensational Killing- Victim's Body
Found Floating Despite Weight of Chains Indicted
Man Admits Forgeries of Dead Man's Name.
At Valf late Thursday afternoon the Grand Jury re
turned an indietinent charging I). 0. Hriehoux with sec
ond degree murder In connection with the death of B, c.
Goodwin. The trial will take place at the next term of
court, probably in February.
As strange as a chapter from the
crimes In the Moulin Kouge la the
atory of the eventa which lead up lo
and followed the death of K
(I.umi Ooodwln of thla city and
Boise, Idaho. Mr Ooodwln, who la
well ki'i n In all thla region as "a
wealthy sheep man waa killed on the
Boulevard road two miles west of tho
city about midnight. Monday. Sept.
4. The first news or his death came
when his body, weighted down with
automobile chains and the hub of
an auto, waa found floating In the
Sm.ke river by the railroad bridge
Monday, September 11. .
In thn meantime, D. C Brichoax,
an auto driver, and hitherto respect
ed citizen, now u self confessed forg
er and bootlegger, who has confessed
killing Ooodwln, tho he asserta It
was an accident, was about the streets
from September fi until September k
apparently unconcerned about Ou
traged)', the details of which he kept
closely guarded Perhaps he never
would have told had not the body he
threw into ihe river risen to proclaim
the fact.
Not only did Brlchoux keep the
details of the killing to himself but
he lost no time In proceeding to pro
fit by the death of Ooodwln by using
ev.-r meant aaagMM M P"" tgfO '"r
his own use some of the wealth he
knew Ooodwln to poaaeaa.
In this he was aided by his close
knowledge of Goodwin's affairs gain
ed thru close personal association for
some time past. Brlchoux and Oood
wln had been friends. As the aelf
confessed forger admitted to Sheriff
Ben Brown. "Ooodwln was the beat
friend I ever had "
To secure Goodwin's wealth, which
Sheriff Brown and other officials be
have If accident theory g not true
was the motive for the crime
he followed the oft repeated story ot
adding one violation of the law on
another and in ho doing forged a
chain of aJroajBOtaaaaa which, the au
thoriues aatlave he can not now
break
Today a special session of tlie
0-r.iiol ttirv nt Vale will list. ll to Ihe
evidence in tlie case and it la be-
li.Md will hold Hriehoux for the
crime There is a possibility, thai
should the iury return an Indictment

Urn houi Ntory of the KUBng.
The atory of the actual killing can
heat be told as it was related by
Brlchoux to Sheriff Brown follow
ing hla arrest here Tuesday night,
which was as follews:
"We were returning from Steen's
mountain where I had driven him and
It waa about midnight Monday, Sept
4, when we reached the Jim Butler
ranch and a dog ran out In front of
the car. Lum picked up the gun
that was lying on the seat between
us and was going to shoot It when I
said, 'don't shoot It, Lum.' Then
Ooodwln whirled and stuck the gun
In my face near the right eye, skin
ning my nose and aald, "To hell with
you.'
Shot In Scuffle.
"I grabbed the gun," Brlchoux
continued, "with both hands and we
tusseled for possession of It, and lln n
I l'e gun went off He (Ooodwln I
sort of slumped down In the aeat
and 1 aald, 'Did It hit you baa'
and he didn't answer. The gun fell
down Into the front of the car I
spoke to him again aud he dldu'l
answer and I saw he was dead The
liuilei went In, 1 suppose about tin
ear. "
DuiiimmI IIIiii hi Creek.
"In the tussel for possession of
the gun the automobile ran Into the
ditch and when 1 found Ooodwln
,.i d.-.i.l I got out of the machine
and walked about a 100 yards. 1
was feeling pretty hard toward's l.um
then I thought to myself, here 1 am
a man with a family and he aOali)
killed me. Then 1 went hack to tin
car, drove it out of the ditch and to
the bridge. Taking the hody out of
the car I tied u life chain aud an ex
tra Ford hub to it and threw It Into
"There Is where I made my big
mistake," he com- , ,i "I should
have brought him into town hut u
ureal fear po . . I me thai no one
would believe lnv stor After I
