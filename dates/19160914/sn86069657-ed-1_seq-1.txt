munion service on the 24th. All
the members are urged to be
present at these-services, as well

ou thin laud", but where they will
grow they produce a much great
er quantity of feed per acre, and
fully as good quality.
Special Courts.

Circuit Court was held at Irvine
last week to adjust some dis
putes over oil territory. In the

claimed by different parties, but
jn the meantime those persons in
possession of the property go
merrily on getting the oil out of
Mother Earth just so iaat as is
possible.

Assessment Commences.

payers of .the county to assess
their property at what is its near
worth so that the State will not
have to raise, all o,f us to keep the
total assessment something close
up to what it has been in former
years. Everybody knows, that
the property value of, Powell

shows a decline. Something is
wrong, and ."how is the time to
