SIMPSON RETURNS TOMORROW
With skin darkened by the rays ot
the sun; with muscles flexible and
hardened by military exercise and out
door liie, and with bodies bruised and
scratched by falls and tumbles while
plying their way through thickets and
brush during skirmishes, the two Co
lumbia "rookies," Walter J. Shepard,
professor of political science, and F.
F. Stephens, assistant professor of
American history in the University,
arrived in their home city this morn
ing from the government's citizen
camp held at Plattsburg, X. Y. The
camp lasted thirty days.
Both University professors were
well pleased with the military life.
"Camp life at Plattsburg agreed with
me ery much," said Professor Shep
ard today. "I never felt better in my
life. We began our daily work every
morning at C o'clock with a hearty
breakfast of bacon and eggs and
stewed prunes. Then we drilled in
close formation for a half hour. The
most spectacular incident in the whole
camp was when the complete camp
of 3,000 "rookies" assembled together
on the parade grounds for their
daily "setting up exercise," as it was
called."
Under Strict Discipline.
Beth professors are ardent believers
in military preparedness and voted
with the rest of the camp when a reso
lution was adopted asking that mili
tary service be made universal.
"The discipline was very strict,"
said Professor Stephens, who was
still dressed In his khaki trousers and
shirt, "the banker and the clerk were
treated alike. Mayor Mitchell of New
York and some minor bookkeeper from
the West had to obey the same orders
as the two sons of Colonel Roosevelt.
"Professor Shepard said that the
discipline not only made good sol
diers but taught them how to obey
others and control themselves. Major
Doret, a native Missourian, was com
mandant of the camp. He received
his military training in St. -Louitf
years ago.
"The location of the camp on Lake
Champagne was beautiful," said Pro
fessor Shepard. "We had wonderful
scenery for miles around.
"The officers were the pick of the
, army. They not only knew military
but they also knew how to teach It.
Major General Wood, who was present
at the camp daily, was a great in
spiration to the men. He lectured
twice on military preparedness."
On TO.Mile Hike.
"The last week of the camp was
spent In a hike In which we covered
about seventy miles. While hiking,
wc had skirmishes and other military
maneuvers."
Both professors said they were well
pleased with the conduct of the camp,
although this was their first experi
ence as "warriors." They had nothing
but praise for the many army officers
who helped conduct the camp. AH
the food was prepared by regular
army cooks. The man did no cook
duty unless they had disobeyed or
ders and according to the Colum
bia "rookies," they were never among
those detailed for cook work.
It Is not Known Whether He Will
.Make Trip to Europe.
Bob Simpson has arrived in Bos
worth and will probably be In Colum
bia tomorrow or next day, according
ta a telegram received this morning
by the University department of ath
letics.
Wherether or not Simpson goes to
'Europe with the other athletes making
up the American team rests almo.-.t
entirely with him, for he alrr.nd yhas
the permission of the athletic depart
ment. He is a senior this year and iu-eds
full work in order to .graduate next
June. His trip to Europe would take
him until the early part of Nov ember
and force him to lose half a semes
ter's work possibly more. With half
credit for next -semester he could
finish next year by attending summer
session. It is not known here wheth
er or not he wishes thus to delay his
graduation.

Hr United Press.
WASHINGTON', Sept. 14. The text
of the written assurance given Ameri
can Ambassador Guthrie at Tokyo by
the Japanese foreign office regarding
Japanese adherence to the "open
door" policy In China In connection
with the recently signed Russo-Japanese
treaty was given out by the
State Department today.
Part of the text follows:
"The -Imperial Government desires
to assure the American government
that the new convention is in no sense
designed to repeal or to modify the
provisions of Article 2 of the conven
tion concluded between Japan and
Russia, July 31, 1907, nor has the Im
perial Government of Japan entertain
ed for a moment any intention to de
part from the policy to which they
have committed themselves respect
ing the maintenance of the indepen
dence in territorial integrity of China,
as well as the equal opportunity for
trade of all nations in that country.
"On the contrary, they are as
strongly convinced as ever of the use
fulness of that policy in the interests
of general stability in the Far East. !and hospitals are now being cstab
"The purchase of Red Cross Seals
is not only an obligation, but an op
portunity to help in a work that can
not be done individually," said Dr.
Walter McNab Miller, who is in
charge of the State Association for
the Relief and Control of Tubercu
losis, in his speech today before the
Commercial Club at the weekly lunch
eon at Harris'.
"The association was organized in
1911," continued Doctor Miller, "and
the first year we used a room in my
home, and wrote our correspondence
by hand. The second year we rented
a room in the Miller building, rented
one typewriter and hired one stenog
rapher. The third year we had two
rooms and two machines; the fourth
year three rooms and four machines;
the fifth year four rooms and eight
machines; this year we have the en
tire second floor of the building and
10 machines and operators.
Postage Birr Is $I,S00.
"Our postage bill the first year was
$75 and last year it was $1,800. We
started work with four helpers, and
this year will employ seventy-five.
The first printing was done in terms
of one hundred; now we print cir
culars in terms of one million.
"The sales amounted in the first
year to $400; last year to $11,000; this
year we expect $20,000. We will have
a circular in every home in the state, i
our aim is a campaign of education,
and the sale of seals is necessary, but
secondary.
Sa).s Work Is Worth While.
"We arc asked, 'Is this worth
while?' In 1911, 5,113 people died
from tuberculosis and last year, 4,
C48 deaths resulted from this disease
a saving of 10 per cent. According
to authorities, the value of life to
self and community can be expressed
in money alue, and is set at $8,000
each. Ours is an economic savin? as
well. It is estimated that the saving
to the state in 1915, was $4,000,000 .
"At the last state legislature, five
bills were passed in favor of this work

These written assurances were
given to Mr. Guthrie, September 13,
in reply to a request from the State
Department made August 1G for in
formation regarding the treaty. The
Russian minister of foreign affairs
has similarly assured the American
Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Francis,
regarding the treaty.

ARMOR PLANT SITE CXSETTLED
V. S. Nbtj Board Will Visit Proposed
Location.
By J. P. YODER
(Unlled Press Staff Correspondent)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14. With
conclusion of arguments by repre
sentatives of the 125 cities that want
the government armor plate plant ex
pected tonight or tomorrow, the navy
general board has decided to visit a
majority of the sites promised.
Some of the sites proposed, it was
stated, will necessarily have to be
abandoned at the start because they
do not come within the section of
the law which provides that the plant
must be "located with special refer
ence to safety in time of war."
That section all members of the
general board today said will be the
principal issue Involved In the loca
tion of the plant, which will mean em
ployment to many thousands of men
and a payroll of many hundreds of
thousands of dollars monthly.

Signs To Attract Tourists.
Dr. J. B. Cole reported that the
markers of the Old Trails Road were
all placed in this county. The money
necessary to do this was raised by Dr.
Cole, and there was a surplus that
will insure a sign at the corner of
Ninth street and Broadway pointing
toward the University, for the bene
fit of tourists. Dr. Cole also sug
gested that a sigh be placed at the
entrance to the University grounds on
Eighth street, inviting tourists to
drive through the grounds.

"Wc ha?e the best company and the
beit regiment on the border" said
Mess-Sergeant James Garth of Com
pany F, Missouri Infantry, who ar
rived in Columbia from Laredo, Tex.,
this morning.
Sergeant Garth and Private Frank
Ketchum, who is also a member of
Company F, left Columbia as members
of the local machine gun company,
which was later changed into a com
pany of infantry. Garth is on a 30-
day furlough, while Ketchum has a
20-day leave of absence.
"The men from this city are In
good condition, and look like regular
soldiers," continued Sergeant Garth,
talking from under a shower-bath at
the Elks' Club. "Sid Rollins has leit
the hospital, but it will be several
days before he will be able to take
active part in drill. We have had
drill every day, and have taken sev
eral long hikes, but our regiment has
not yet been called upon to do pa
trol' duty, except In Laredo, when we
were stationed there. For several
days we have been one the range,
and when the morning practice starts
a person thinks he is in the midst
of a real battle. Our regiment will
have this practice and maneuvers for
several days.
Students Anxious 1o Return.
"The men think that they may be
returned to this part of the country
when the range is deserted, but we
have no official information on any
thing. There is some question as to
whether or not the student-soldiers
will be released for some time. The
recent orders were delayed, and it
will be at least ten days before any
action will be taken. There are a
large number of students in our regi--ment,
and they are anxious to get back
to school."
"When wc were in Laredo, we saw
more 'greasers' than wc had ever seen
before. There arc 18,000 people there.
and about 16,000 are Mexicans. We
have very little trouble with them.
But say, it sure is good to get back,"
concluded Garth and he jumped back
under the shower.
See Only Mexican Officers.
When Ketchum was seen by a Mis
sourian reporter, his endurance was
ebbihg. The men came in uniform,
and from teh station to their homes,
they were besieged by questioning
citizens. Ketchum carried a Mexican
basket which was curiously examined
by everyone.
"It is very uncertain when we will
get home," said Ketchum. "There Is
little change In the situation, but we
are anxious to get back. There are
many soldiers across the border, but
the Mexican officers are the only ones
we can distinguish as soldiers. They
are in white uniform, but the Mexi
can private decorates himself to his
own satisfaction, and there seems to
be no regulation uniform."
