September Fashion
Notes.
The stores are showing a full
line of all that is new in fabrics,
and as models galore are to be
had in all the latest types of cos
tume, people who have the mon
ey are wisely investing before
prices, soar higher, as they are
scheduled to do.
Ecclesiastical Silks.
. The newly imported silks that
( France ha3 sent over, notwith
standing the handicap of war
conditions, can only be described
by superlative adjectives; "mag
nificent" and "gorgeous" are
two that seem adequate to char
acterize the showing in the high
errade pieces. Gold and silver,
with colorings of every hue, from
moonlight blue to the deepest and
richest tones. Fine jardiniere
floral ctripes, old time pompa
dours, and single flower and leaf
designs of mammoth proportions,
are some of thelhings to be not
ed in the new showing. Thete
win maKe gorgeous evening
wraps, or rich linings for man
ties of fur, and will be employed
for evening and reception frocks,
usually in combination with light
er plain materials. Metal faconne
or brocade is woven combined
' with figured silk. For instance.
there will be single flowers of the
McCall Designs .
metal joined by festoons of flow
ers in the silk brocade. A large
maple leaf of silver is one of the
notable patterns of this sort. Or
chid in the reddish hue of that
flower1 is a favorite tone, its rich
ness enhanced by a striped de
sign i n silver brocade. Bayadere
stripes will, continue modish.
Clair-de-lune satin has cloud de
signs developed in silver, and
other patterns suggest Gothic ar
ches of cathedrals or the stained
glass of cathedral windows
Blocked and plaided silks of rich
but subdaed colorings are to be
used for blouse and for day wear
gowns combined with woolen
fabrics.
Velvets Prominent.
' Velvets are prominent as al
ways when fur dominates the
mode, as it does at present.
Light weight velvets both in cor
ded and plain weaves will be very
much worn.
A Charming Model ,
in one of the new "Betty Wales"
social dresses, is of panne velvet
combined with white silk net. In
turquoise velvet it is especially
pretty. The net skirt is finished
with scat ruffles of yelvet, is
topped by a sleeveless over-blouse
of the same material girdled with
silver ribbon, and showim? the
net in sleeve and bodice finishes.
Designed and made here in New
York these "Betty Wales" dress-
es have ciptured the girls all over
the country as completely as did
the heroine of the popular stories
for whom they are named. Their
smartness of style and beauty of
coloring appeals to the girls,
while mothers like the quality of
the materials used in serge, silk
or evening frocks, and appreciate
their fineness of finish and mod -
est price.
New Hats.
Velvet hats are display ed at-
tractively in both large and small
shapes, many of the best models
built on small brimless turban
frames with either high puffed
velvet empiecements surrounding
the crown, or with crowns on the
tarn" order draped and posed
in ways that greatly increase the
height of the hat. Jet pins, bands,
and other ornaments are placed
directly at the front of the hat,
and .there is a decided vogue for
ostrich used in the narrow bands,
and small tips, particularly for
gray feathers on black hats. Silk
beaver in black especially makes
some of the smartest blocked
hats exhibited at the fashionable
stores. Stockings of wool are
shown for sports and will be ap
propriate for skating which will
doubtless be even more popular
next winter than last.

the
Signature of
Obituary.
Rev. Robert Mulford Sharp was
born near Centerville, Montgom
ery county, Ohio, September 11,
837, and departed this life at his
home in Darke county on Septem
ber 7, 1916, aged 78 year?, 11
months and 26 days.
His parents moved from Mont
gomery county toSharpeye, Darke
county; Ohio, in 1863. After his
return from the urmy in 1864 he
was married to Sarah Ann Wea
yer: to this uniow was born three
sons and one daughter, one ton
and the daughter still survive
He leaves to mourn their loss one
son, one daughter, six grand
children, two great-grandchild
ren and two sisters, besides ma
ny more distant" relatives and
friends, the wife of hih youth
having departed to the realms
beyond five years ago.
Brother Sharp became a Chris
tian in early life and was at the
time of his decase a member of
the Coletown Christian church.
He taught school several years in
his younger days and was the
first superintendent of the East
side high school in Union City.
For several years his health had
been failing, and twenty months
ago he fell while in Union City,
sustaining injuries from which
never recovered. But one
great joy to him-, and a great
consolation to his relatives and
friends, was that he was pre
pared at all times to go. He
served his country nobly dunng
the great rebellion, but better
still, he was soldier in the army
of the Lord, fighting continually
for the right under a captain that
was never ioiiea in Datiie or
beaten m the field. So while we
say goodbye, it is only for a lit
tle while, for if we are faithful
as was he we shall meet in the
morning of God's eternal day.

THESE PIPING TIMES
CARRANZA
HUGHES FOR ARBITRATION.
He Would Be First to Accord to Labor
All Right Found Just After
Consideration.
Ia Ms Maine speeches Mr. Hughes
made It plain that he was not attack
ing labor or the equity of the pro
posed Increase of wanes for the rail
road men. He was simply contending
for the Ml important principle of arbi
tration as th right means of settle
ment of such questions. Speaking at
different places in Maine Mr. Hughes)
dwelt upon this question, saying:
"I deeply deplore, in the name of
labor, in the name of justice, in the
name of American ideals, the surren
der of the Executive and of Congress
to force, instead of permitting reason
to reign.
'The measure to which I have allud
ed was not. properly speaking, an
eight-hour measure. It was a wage
measure. It was a plain proposition
for a change in the wage scale. I do
not speak of the equity of that. That
is a matter to he fairly considered. I
want what is just and right with re
spect to wages. I am for the arbitra
tion and the peaceful settlement of
these industrial controversies. We
can settle everything in this country
If we approach those matters with a
fair and open mind and an examina
tion of the facts.
"This particular measure shows on
its face that it was legislation in ad
vance of tjhe investigation, instead of
investigatiim In advance of legisla
tion. It is said that there was in its
favor the judgment of society. The
Judgment of society In this Country
has never been passed in favor of leg
islation without knowledge of the equi
ty and regardless of the facts of the
case. There was no judgment of so
ciety in favor of the roads which were
excepted from its provisions. If there
was a judgment of society, why not ap
ply the rule to electric or other kinds
of roads or roads loss than KK1 miles
In length? I say. away with such pre
tense! It was a surrender to force in
stead of a clear, candid, faithful fram
ed examination of the facts, and then
action in accordance with American
principles.
"Autocracy represents force; tyran
ny represents force. '""Democracy rep
resents the rule of the common Judg
ment after discussion, after an oppor
tunity to know' the facts."
It All Depend.
"If Hughes wins an' Oregon town
will get" a new shingle mill employing
fifty men," says the Olympia Recorder,
"according to an announcement of the
Individual -who took au option on tim
bered land. If Wilson wins the option
will be allowed to lapse. That's the
way with n thousand aud one enter
prises, all waiting to see which way
the wind blows. The moment it is as
sured that Charles E. Hughes is elect
ed, Just watch the wheels of Industry
spin and listen to the bum of business."

.Well do I mind the story, said
Fiunegan. lialiiam was a highbrow
that knowed less than his Jackass. H"
took an ol.ice to curse the people.
The Jp.ckass saved them. "lis all in
Xumliers Twinty-two. Och hoin1! 'Tis
different these times. The Jackass
knew better till I'-atuaui taiued him.
"I jive me ride ye," says Iialaam, Van'
I'll make ye the biggest Ass in ,the
vvurld."
"Great." says the Ass; "what d'ye
feed?"
"1'ofk," t-ays Ralaam.
"Me savior." says the Ass.
S Iialaam mounts. I5ut soon the
lack balks.
"Phwat is it?" says Balaam.
"?tnal;e!-," says the Ass; "Vt looks
like the jawbone uv rue mother."
"G'wan," i;.-;ys P.sJaam, hittin' the
Ass a clip, "'tis me f-.irren' policy,''
lie says.
"I'hwafs ut for?" axes the Ass.
"Ut dciinds the nasliun," says P.a
laam.
"How?" saj's the Ass.
"FaiUi," says Balaam, "ut takes a
bigger Ass than you to know that.
Lave it to r.iine,' says Iialaam to the
Ass; an' the Jack walks on niedita
tin'. "Hoe, haw," says the Ass, bnlUhi' an'
kickin'.
"What now?" says Balaam.
"Divil a Jackass ever seen the like."
says the Ass. PVt could be a frog,"
says he, "for ut stands up In front,
an' sits down ireiiind; an' 'tis nios'ly
mouth," says the Ass. "Ut has white
feathers," says the Jack, "wid yaller
streaks, that changes," he says, "to
VeryCrooz Bed. or Xlngaray Blue, an'
now they're Cnrrysall Yar again,"
says he. "Hivins, have I been drink
In'?" screams the Ass to Balaam.
"Saints be praised," says Balaam. 1
.ue uurcuiui waitm' can still ctiange
its mind," he says. "O'wau, where
glory waits," he says. "G'wan, in the
service, uv Mankind," says Balaam to
the Ass, touching him up. An' the
Ass shuffles ahead, wavin' his ears in
admiration.
"Hee-haw! Hee-haw!" says the Jack,
rearin' up wid his eyes bulgin'.
'Thwat's grippin! ye now?" says Ba
laam, impashunt like.
"I donno," says the Ass. "Ut looks
like the Flyin' Dutchman with a So-,
cialist Crew," he says.
"'Tls me Ship Bill," suys Balaam.
"Side step to the right," he says; "side
step to the left," says he, weltiu' him.
"Back up," says Balaam, near wrench
in' off the Jack's Jaw. "Xpw forward
for the Merchant Marine an fifty
millyun pork," says Balaam wid a
shower uv blows; an' the Asa goes on
thremblin'.
"Wah-uee! Wah-hee! Wah-hee!"savs

the Jack, shyia' so he near threw his I
rider.

"I'll learn ye to shy ;:l me Naval
Bill." says Balaam, lar-rupin' the baste
so he cud scarce stand.
"Ye can't pass ut v.idout weariu'
Republican clothes," says the Jack in a
coarse whisper.
"Ye Ass." says Balaam. "Kon't ye
know that tinny clots is betther nor
nakedness? G'wan." says Bala:hu. in
tones uv thunder. Po the !'"! baste
lopes on, liuipin' wid pain.
I've not time to toil xo all the adven
tures thev had. but thov kep' on over
rough roads, now an' then crossin" a
ditc'i on a wan term plank, which
made even Balaam unaisy. Iviry time
the Jack kicked, he got short rations
an' a wallup. So w hen the journey
was near over, the poor haste wus all
in, and far too proud to fiisht. Any
Jack-Ass can be that when lie's licked.
Wan siormy night, the Jack blooms
into a harmony like a lUniycrat Tariff
Hymn played on a gaspiiw wid the feet.
'Thwat ails ye now';'' calls Balaam,
elubbin' him wid both hands.
"Xivverdid I pass the like," yells tiio
Ass, sweat in' and thremblin'. "Ut
says ut's an eight hour law. Oh, phwat
is ut?" screams the Ass to Balaam,
feebly wagglin' his ears.
."I dinno phwat ut is meself," says
Balaam, "bitt I know phwat ut's got,"
Balaam says.
'Thwat?'' axes the poor Ass. (
"Five humlther thousand votes,'; says
Balaam, wid a pious air. "G'wan, ye
big Ass. an' doant ye argue wid an1
Idaylist." says Balaam to the Ass.'
"We can't pass ut in the dark," pleads
the Ass. "Lave us wait for light,"
moans the Ass, weepin'.
"Nix," says Balaam, "There's a hot
time comin' an' the votes'U spile. Do
ye thurst for sixteen more years in the
wilderness? Giddip." says he, "purg
iu' ye'r heart," says Balaam, "iv iviry
thought that's sellish," says Balaam,
"or personal," chants Balaam to the
poor Ass ticklin' the Jack's slats wid a
couplin' pin.
By this time, the Ass was so wore
out bls amyous labors, that he
knew no more than Iialaam himself.
So, wid one despairln' cry. he dropped
his ears, as he an' his master stumbled
forward into the dur.
