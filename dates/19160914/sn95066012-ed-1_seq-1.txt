after the union leaders had offered
not only to arbitrate, but to waive ob
jection for the time to the "master
and servant" contracts, if they should
be modified so as not to hinder the
workers from joining a labor union.
The stand of the traction iieads de
stroyed any hope Mayor Mltchel and
Chairman Oscar S. Straus may have
had of bringing the two parties to
gether immediately and of ending the
strike at once.
Hundreds more strike breakers were
put to work yesterday, and railway
managers declared they would not be
satislied until they had completely
crushed the power of the union lead
ers. LeaderR of the union insisted, how
ever, that they would continue the
strike until they forced the companies
to their terms.
"The public already knows who is
to blame for the strike, and that the
union is not to blame," said William.

the union. "This light is being forced

ORGANIZING WAR SUPPLIES
Wonderful Work Done in Russia With
out Adequate Preparation.
What Russia has done in providing
the national organization of war sup
plies back of the army In the past
year is a wonderful evidence of what
may come after the war. Russia went
Into the war without adequate prepar
ation, but with tin- military organiza
tion much letter than the Industrial
and traffic system that Is required be
hiud the armies in modern war. The
army swept forward too strongly for
Its support. Russia received a les
son. The nation saw in a moment
what was lacking. The. effectiveness
with which the whole nation got tV
gether behind the army has an unmis
takable .significance.
Prom the imperial government out
to the smallest political envisions ot
Russia It was speedy organization of
ffcrt. Kvery facility was put to use
and all have been skillfully co-orelill-uted.
Some new industrial facilities
have been constructed. What Russia
COUld produce WSJ got moving In the
ii:!!! direction. War supplies In im
mense unioimt had to be obtained
from outside through Inadequate se.i
ports, with what innciunery tor pro
duotion and transportation she had.
Russia has done well. The traveler
sees much of this. The traffic lo and
from the front moves In great volume
with the best of organization. No
sees trains of troops flue, big men,
well-fed. completely arined, every man
in a new or 1 rood uniform, going for
ward.
The hospital traffic coming buck
from the front where heavy lighting. Is
in progress is just as significant of
Russian ability to organize. The
trains move steadily on. The cars are
clean an dcc.inpletely equipped.
Wounded men, In clean white, are at
tended by surgeons and nurses who
are Intelligent, alert and devoted. An
immense volume of this moves with
out hitch or disorganization. The Rus
skin railroads are taxed to their limits
by the traffic. ( Ml necessities have

Mile or mile, the railroads of Russia
