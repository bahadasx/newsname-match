' ;', The new oil'mill bulit by the Wilson
Products Company in Alton Park, near
' Chattanooga, announces .that it will
use a large amount of peanut oil in the
manufacture of its lard compound, and
hence this has given a boost to the cul-
, tlvatioh of peanuts in the state. There
is an abundance of sandy loam in the
' section around Chattanooga especially
adapted to the cultivation of peanuts,
and this announcement adds to mak
In tha "nwiher" an additional money-
making crop. .
More than 1,200 pennies were found
by some negro girls picking blackber
ries near Bear Springs. It is the opin
ion of some that they belonged to the
old Stewart County Bank that was
robbed by burglars who blew the safe

In a sack, and when the robbers made
an examination and found them to be
pennies they threw them away be
cause they were too cumbersome for
their value.

Congress for decisive action to pre

County will leave Johnson City Mon
day morning, August 21, with from
fifty to sixty automobiles bound foi

and intermediate stops. The object of
the trip is to create a more friendly

That the way of the bootlegger, 4&fao
is the arch transgressor in the etate
of Tennessee these days, is hard, is
evidenced by the fact that A. C. Clem
mons was fined $150 in Jackson City
Court on the charge of storing and
selling beer, and later required to give
$500 bond in magistrate's court on
the same charge. What's more, he
will have to face the Criminal Court
on the charges in September with a
county road sentence and additional
fine looking him in the face.
The story of a band of counterfeiters
whch operated on Big Creek in the
'first district of Cooke County many
years ago was recalled recently by the

pieces to the $20 denominations. The
outfit was in the position of the late
D. A. Mima, with whom it had been
left for safe keeping from the time
the band was broken up until last
week when it was turned over to the
Federal officers.
RUSHES AND WILSON A6REE
The Berea (Ky.) Citizen makes a
good point for Berea College In quot
ing the words fjf the two opposing can
didates for President, both endorsing
the educational work of this institu-,
tlon for the Southern mountains.
It seems both men appeared on the
platform at a meeting in behalf of Be
rea College in Washington last win
ter. Berea 1b distinguished for its spe
cial adaptations to the needs of the
mountains. Hughes made the follow
ing statement: "There is no mora
promising part of America, or one
more in need of aid, than these South
ern Highlands, and one's notions of
education really have to be enlarged
to comprehend all that is embraced in
the splendid work of Berea."
President Wilson said: "The object
of Berea is to do what America was
intended to do, te give to people who
have not had it an ' opportunity. I
do not see how anybody can think of
Berea and the work it is doing without
catching fir." .

"THE BIRTH OF A NATION"!
For the special benefit of visitors
to Nashville during State Fair week,
"The Birtj, of a Nation': has been
booked for a return engagement at
the Vendome Theatre with the same
symphony orchestra of thirty, and
the same elaborate stage effects
which thrilled upwards of 45,000
people at the Vendome last January.
There will be two performances
daily at 2:30 and 8:15 and seats for
all performances will be on sale rt
the box office after Friday morning,
September 15th.
It will be remembered that hund
reds who failed to obtain seats in ad
vance were turned away during the
previous Nashville engagement and
it is urged that all who can possibly
do so arrange to purchase tickets
through friends in the city or mail
their orders to the management, with
remittances payable to the Vendome
Theatre. The return engagement
has been arranged in response to a
popular demand and all indications
point to a repetition of the crowding
and confusion that attended the first
showing of the Griffith masterpiece
in the Tennessee capital. ,
By way of brief description of the
mighty film opera, which has been
witnessed by upwards of ten million
people, it may be characterized as a
1500,000 picturization of Dixie's sor
rows and glories of the Civil war and
reconstruction periods, adapted from
the "Clansman" and fitted to a must
cal score of grand opera reaches. In
its great battle scenes 18,00fr people
and 3,000 horses are shown and
Jamong the Impressive historical
scenes are President Lincoln signing
his call for volunteers. Sherman's
march through Georgia, the burning
of Atlanta, Lee and Grant at Appo
mattox, the assassination of Presi
dent Lincoln in Ford's theatre, Wash
ington and the rise of the Ku Klux
Klan.
Prices have been substantially re
duced for the return engagement ai
though the spectacle will be shown
exactly as it commanded $2 for the
best seats throughout the country
last season. This time the best seats
will be $1.50 at night and $1 at the
matinee. Other prices, 'will be:
nights 50c, 75c, and $1, and matinees,
25c, 50c and 76c. , " '
NOTICE. TO TEACHERS
At a recent meeting of the Board
of Education, Bass Butler of Boma
was elected Attendance Officer for
this county. It is the duty of every

CONCERNING THE STATU FAIR
PROGRAM.
It is the province of the modert
fair to entertain as well as to instruct,
and the organization that neglect
that highly important function is on
the road to unpopularity, which, soon
or late, means financial embarrass
ment. It may be said that the world nevet
levoted so much time and effort to. th
pursuit of pleasure as it does today,
That is true. It is also true that tht
vorld .never did so much work, nor
uch good work, as it does to-day. Th
properly balanced life, the one' that
represents the acme of efficiency, ln
eludes a certain amount of recreation
and relaxation from toll, that the brain
and physical machinery may recover

the Fair visitor a happy combination
of instruction and entertainment Aa
an institution, the mission of the Fair
la to educate, even as work is man's
business in life and the excuse for hit
existence. Its processes are educative,
and the Instruction offered Is of th
most practical sort. The Individual in.
terested in agriculture and its allied
Industries will find the latest and best
Ideas and methods exploited at th
State Fair. It is a giant demonstra
tion of progress, an exhibition by mei
who have achieved success. And if th
Individual be of open mind, the good
gained by a week at the Fair is not tt
be measured by yardsticks or dollars.
The State Fair program must necea
sarily be a varied one to suit a con
stituency with a variety of tastes and
pursuits. The management has pro
vided a bill of high-class entertain
ment and a program worth while la
tvery particular.
