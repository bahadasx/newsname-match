Milk Dealers Say No.
The demand made upon the eight big j
milk dealers of Baltimore city by the
Maryland and Pennsylvania Milk Produc
ers Association, representing milk deal
ers of Frederick, Howard, Carroll and
Baltimore counties, was flatly turned
down last week at a meeting held at the
Rennert Hotel in Baltimore. The pro
ducers asked a 2 cent advance or 20 cents
per gallon for their milk, due to the fact
that all kinds of feed has advanced in
price, hence the cost of production made
greater.
In brief, the reason for refusal was
that the effect of such an increase in
price as was asked would be to lessen
the consumption of milk, and at the
same time to increase the supply, so that
the eight big dealers would be caught in
an agreement to pay high prices, while
187 small dealers, handling the other 50
percent, of the milk sent to the city,
would be able to buy at the lower general
market figures which would result from
a decrease in demand and an increase in !
supply. The big dealers said that would
lead to retail price cutting by the smaller
dealers, to the disadvantage of the form
er, who, paying more to the shippers,
would be compelled to charge their cus
tomers more.
Pen-Mar Closed.
Sunday last Pen-Mar Park closed for
the season of 1916. From all reports,
the Park has enjoyed the biggest season
in its history. On the closing day the
Western Maryland railroad hauled nearly
a thousand people to the Park, and the
trolley from Waynesboro hauled another
thousand or more. The Waynesboro
Daily Herald in its issue of Monday last
says;
“The railroad, amusement managers,
hotel men, boarding house keepers, cab
men, and all the concessionaires unite in
saying the season just closed was the
best in the history of the park, in the
way of attendance and business. The
only drawback was the enormous price
of all meats, poultry and country pro
duce. The profits of hotels and boarding
houses were largely swept away by high
prices of all they had to buy.
A notable thing about this season, was
the phenomenal streak of luck the big
days had. Every one of them from May
30 to Knights of Pythias last week was
clear and rainless, something that has
never before happened.”
Will Hold Annual Reunion.
Under ideal conditions of weather and
good fellowship, the Grand Lodge of
Knights of Pythias of the Grand Domain
of Maryland held the first reunion of the
order last week at Pen-Mar.
There are now in this State 97 lodges
and more than 10,000 members of the
fraternity. The initial picnic was attend
ed about 1,500 persons, representing
Western and Eastern lodges, and it was
unanimously decided to endeavor to make
i such an outing an annual affair. |

KEEKER.
Carroll David, infant son of Mr. and
Mrs. J. Carroll Keefer, of Waynesboro,
Pa., died Friday, Sept. 8, death being due
to spasms, with which malady the child
has been afflicted for some time. Funeral
; services were held Saturday morning at
Mt. Carmel church, Thurmont, Rev. Rey
nolds officiating. The deceased was aged
2 years, 1 month and 14 days.
IN MEMORIAM.
Thurmont, Sept. 10, 1916.
The following is dedicated to the mem
ory of little Carroll David Keefer, who
died in Waynesboro, 12.10 o’clock Friday
morning, September 8, 1916.
He has entered thegreat unknown from
which no one ever returns to relate to us
the immensity, wonders, and beauty of
our long and future home.
Nature was very unkind to the little
babe for she denied him one of her great
est gifts, good health, but withal), in his
childhood, very suddenly, his Good and
Merciful Lord released the innocent little
boy from all, by giving him a sure and
an easy way to heaven.
Of course we think it sad that he had
to give up the willing smiles and fond
caresses of his mamma, papa, sisters and
brother ami leave them all behind, but
he had to obey the call of the Great Om
nipotent Power over and above us all.
He was chosen to yield up his young
life to his Creator who gave him that life
for a purpose. •
Just for us to fathom the perfect wis
dom of our great creator would be a dif
ficult task. Hut some things we do know.
We know that his innocent soul was
spared the many sins, dangers and evils
of a world full of anxieties, sufferings,
mental and physical, and hopes hard to
fulfill.
Another, we feel sure of; by his being
called to yield up his all here below, ho
has been given God’s choicest gift for
which so many must struggle long and
patiently.
In thinking of the little son’s case I
feel happy in saying that our Blessed
Lord made known to us one of his kind
acts by giving rest and sleep to his deli
cate body, and on his pure soul He be
stowed the crown of life: and his soul
will continue with joy and happiness by
loving, praising and glorifying his all
powerful Master for having done so much
for himself, for his parents and for his
relatives.
Those whom he left here below should
labor earnestly in order to reach, one
day, his company in that immense and
long future.
GRANDFATHER.
In memory of ourdear mother, Cather
ine E. Wilhide.
Have you a mother? Love her well
While she is spared on earth;
Wait not till death shall call her home
To know her precious worth.
Oh, watch her, guard her with your love
While with you she is left,
For when she leaves you life will seem
Of every joy bereft.
Oh. soothe her in her hour of pain;
Be gentle and be mild.
How sweet ’twill be for you to think
You’ve been a faithful child.
By her two daughters.
Growth Of Extension Work.
An increase since the beginning of
the present calender year from ap
proximately 0,800 to 15,455 in the
number of women in the South en
rolled in home demonstration work,
carried on under the auspices of the
department and State agricultural
colleges, is shown in figures for en
rollment, June 30, 1010, just announ
ced by the Office of Extension Work
South. In the same period, the num
ber of girls enrolled in the canning,
poultry, and other agrictural clubs
carried on under the supervision of
the same office increased from approx
imately 42,500 to 48,749,
The extension work among girls
and women was being carried on at
the end of the fiscal year in 420 coun
ties in all of the 15 Southern States,
through 420 county agents and 50
specialists. In addition, North Caro
lina had 200 subagents and Alabama
19 assistant county agents, who de
voted their time to the extension
activities. The largest enrollment
of the girl demonstrators was in the
canning clubs, which had 32,965
members. In the poultry clubs 10,-
205 girls are learning, through then
local groups, under expert leadership,
the details of raising domestic fowls.
In the clubs devoted to bread making,
3,721 girls were enrolled, and in other
clubs, 858. —Weekly News Letter.

School Etiquette.
1. Keep your face and hands
scrupulously clean. A circle of apple
butter around the mouth, or a piece
of pie on the, ear, may suggest thrift
at home and soiled hands may indicate
that you help mother weed the gar
den and clean out the hog pen, but
according to school ethics and the
Rule of Three, it denotes that your
household is out of soap and water
and the scrub brush is mislaid. Be
sides it doesn’t add to your general
appearance or personal attraction.
The only thing it attracts is the flies,
and as they are only worth five cents
a quart it doesn’t pay as a job. Sol-1
onion said "Cleanliness is next to :
Godliness” and if anyone knew, he
did.
2. Wash your feet frequently.
This may seem unnecessary, as they
are covered up, but it has Apostolic
sanction and they were the first mem
bers of the Ixidy picked out for ab
lution. There is no danger in it,
contrary to public opinion, as we
never heard of any of the Apostols
taking cold from the custom or any
dying from it; besides being healthy
it may save you from embarrassment
and mortification and your teachers
and associates pain and persecution.
3. Keep your nose clean. Tears
from the eyes excite sympathy; drops
from the nose arouse regret. In the
long run, a handerchief is more eco
nomical and labor saving than your
coat sleeve, as with the former you
can wipe both sides at once and use
only one arm, thus expending the
the least possible energy and exer
tion. Besides, from the eyes it is a
flow from the soul; from the nostrils,
it is ’Snot.
4. Keep your hair combed. Fluf
fy and straggling locks may give you
a Paderewski air that is appealing,
and plunging your fingers through
your locks every now and then ab
stractedly may look as if you are on |
the alert and searching for wisdom,
but ten to one, your teacher will mis- |
construe your actions and misjudge
you and send you home to the fam
ily physician for examination and
treatment.
5. Keep nails neatly pared and
clean. If you must wear a badge of
mourning, have it around your hat |
or sleeve and not under your linger
nails; it is considered more elegant
and up to date, and long talons are
in desuetude since the Empress Dow
ager of China lost her job; don’t ape
after the ground mole; remem tier he
has to have long claws to make a liv
ing, as he digs in the ground; andj
besides he has no eyes and can’t see
how vulgar it looks.
G. Keep your mouth closed. This
is especially urged if your teacher is
talking and your teeth have not re-i
ceived the necessary attention. Be-j
sides, it will save you the annoyance
of advertising what you had for
breakfast.
7. Keep you r ears open. Remem - !
her the divine injunction: "He that
hath ears to hear, let him hear what j
the teacher sayeih.”
8. Don’t chew gum. If yoq are
stuck on it, look in the mirror, while
thqs actively engaged, and then go
to the barnyard and watch an old
cow chew her cud and see what pic
ture you respect the most; the cow
of course, because she has an extra
stomach to stomach it.
9. "Be always polite. Don’t shake
and nod your head when addressed
and always say “thank you” when
receiving a favor. Even a donkey
shakes his head only when there are
flies on him and always manages to
bray when given his provender.
Follow these rules and you will be
happy anti your teacher will be proud
of you. —Ex.

Millers Blamed For The High
Price Of Flour.
or for an embargo on wheat exports
in order to keep down the price of
Hour, and it is also absurd, or worse,
for the millers to mark up the price of
flour because the price of wheat ad
vanced suddenly under a bad crop re
port; it also fell suddenly on the en
trance of Roumania into the war.
The millers don’t buy wheat at the
crest of a wave; they carry consider
able stocks and buy when the price
favors them. The prospective wheat
crop is 30,000,000 bushels more
than domestic requirements on a
very high basis, and 120,000,000
bushels more; than those requirements
on a Danis of consumption sanctioned
by the Department of Agriculture.
Futhermore, last years crop was enor
mous, and much more wheat than
usual was brought over to this year.

Plans Night Schools.
The Washington County School
Board expects to open a night school
in Hagerstown for boys from 11 to
It! years old who are employed and
who have not completed seven grades
in school, as required by law.
| They come under the Compulsory
Educational law, which is in force
here for the first time. Superinten
dent Charles K. Dryden thinks it
would be a hardship to the boys and
their employers for the boys to attend
I school at least 100 days, as the law
requires, and he believes that the es
tablishing of the night school would
meet all legial requirements and yet
] would be satisfactory to the pupils
and their employers.
Big Bridge Span Falls.
Quebec, Que., Sept. 11.-The new
central span of the Quebec bridge,
(the largest cantilever suspension via-
Iduct in the world, collapsed and fell
into the St. Lawrence river at 10.30
o’clock Monday morning while being
hoisted into place, with a loss of life
| estimated at not less than 25.
I Nine years ago a similar accident
at the same spot took a toll of <0
lives. Monday 90 men were carried
j into the river when the 5,000 ton
I span, being raised from the pontoons
in an engineering feat designed to
complete the 817,000,000 bridge for
transcontinental railway traffic,
plunged a distance of 15 feet into the
water and sank 200 feet, perhaps
never to be recovered.
New Pension Bill Passed.
Washington, Sept. 8.-A bill giv
ing to widows of officers or enlisted
men who served in the Civil or Mex
ican Wars or in the War of ISI2,
and who have reached the age of 70
years, pensions of 820 a month, in
stead of the present 812, was passed
today by the Senate. It already has
passed the house.
Widows of Civil War soldiers drop

person arc restored to the roll by the
bill.
The brief debate on the bill did
not disclose the additional cost to the

ONE WAY OUT
By ELSIE BEB.
“Oh, you're In for u romance, Dick.”
“I can’t see any romance where a
penniless youth falls In love with the
richest girl in seven states,” grumbled
Dick.
"Things do look dark,” admitted
Jerry. “But I’ve seen you save the
day too many times on a football Held
when things looked dark to doubt that
you’ll come out of this tangle with col
ors Hying and the lady In your arms."
“You get out—l've got an Idea 1”
Dick almost yelled, and his glittering
eye told Jerry that a prodigious plan
was forming In his mind.
For the next mourn, wniie Anne
Morrison danced and motored and
golfed, and while Jerry Dayton did
likewise, Dick Stanford kept to his in
surance ollice by day and to his apart
ment by night until Jerry gave up Hy
ing to draw him Into social life or to
draw from him the secret of his night
ly labors. At the end of a month, how
ever, Jerry's curiosity and his vanity
were gratified by an Invitation to
Dick’s apartment to be the audience
of one to hear the first reading of
Dick’s play entitled, “Out of the Tan
gle."
“Bully for you, old boy 1” and "Rich
ard, you’ll back the dramatized best
sellcrsoff the boards," were comments
that came from the delighted Jerry
during the first part of the reading,
but later he protested: “Oh, come now,
Dick, whoever heard of u rich uncle
from Alaska turning up to back an im
pecunious nephew iu ,t scheme to drive
his prospective father-in-law to the
wall as a means of making him suc
cumb gracefully to the relationship?”
“And whoever heard of people going
to the theater to see something they've
heard all about every day of their
lives?" retorted Dick.
“I throw up my hands!” said Jerry,
making an exaggerated demonstration
of his acceptance of defeat. “On with
the play!”
Dick did go on with the play, and
the play went on the boards almost Im
mediately, bringing so much money
Into the box office and such flattering
offers to its author that he was soon in
sight of affluence. Dick began to hope
that he dared approach Anne .Morri
son’s hopelessly rich father as a pros
pective son-in-law, but it was Jerry's
unhappy lot to knock those hopes fly
ing.
"Old man, I’ve got some rotten news
for you,” said Jerry, as he rounded a
corner of a shady country lane, whither
he had taken Dick for a spin in u re
markably new yellow car. “Our com
pany Is closing a deal with Kllhu Mon
tague for that big lot adjoining the
Morrison home In Huntley place, which
seems like a confirmation of all those
reports that Anne and old Montague
are engaged.”
"You’re a regular storehouse for
comforting thoughts, Jerry.”
"The other cheek, please," said
Jerry, with mock humility, but stalling
so benignly that Dick laughed la spite
of his dejection. "I'm making myself
the bearer of unpleasant tidings to
give you a last chance to go in and
win.”
"A great chance I’ve got to go la
and win now,” muttered Dick.
"The smaller your chances the big
ger your victory—lf you win. Chirp
up, old man. Don’t you know that
while there’s life there’s hope? If you
net like a dead one, of course there's
no hope for you. I might add, Inci
dentally, that this deal will keep Mon
tague here until nest week, and If
you’re the poor but deserving lover I
take you to be, you'll cut In ahead of
him by spending this very week-end up
where the Morrisons are summering
and where Montague has been hanging
out a goodly number of week-ends.”
•Til let you and Anne, too, know
that I’m not u dead one. Will you get
me back to town right away, Jerryi"
With Jerry’s aid Dick mating'd to
get the train, and the next morning,
on the hotel piazza iu an Adirondack
resort, as Anno appeared, all In soft
white corduroy, ho had the Joy oi see
ing pleased surprise lit her eyes ns she
blushlugly met his own rapturous gaze.
She consented to show him the won
ders of the place, their first objective
point being a high point overlooking
a wonderful panorama of sturdy tittle
mountains.
“Don’t you love It?" exclaimed Anno
blissfully.
"Love It? No—l love you,” said
Dick In headlong recklessness. “Anne,
Is there any hope for me? Once I did
hope a little, Anne, but I had nothing
then but a wealth of love to offer you.
I haven’t great material wealth to offer
you now, but enough to begin on and
promising prospects. People are say
ing that you are engaged to Eiihu
Montague, but I cou't give you up
without telling you that neither h nor
any other man could lovo you more
than I do.”
"Why, Dick, Mr. Montague Is g dug
to marry my mother's sister out iu
Denver,” said Anno In surprise. Then
she added, with a pretty little pout;
“If you hadn’t been so busy becoming
a famous playwright, you would have
found out long ago that lurking in tho
wings and leaving the stage to oilier
men Is no way to get a heroine out of
a tangle.”
"Do you menu that I may choose my
own method of getting you out of this
tangle?”
“Yes," whispered Anne, and tho
method which Dick chose was one es
tablished by long usage us both ap
propriate uud adequate.

“By arrangements which were made
when we were landed tit Utah,” sttid
I’rofessor Tanquary, “wo were to pur

relief ship w as to come for us.
Long Wait for Relief Ship.
“We were all wailing in Etah, our
headquarters, for tho relief ship which
was to come for us in 1015. When
August passed and no ship arrived wa
gave up all hope of being brought out
that year. Wo found out Inter that
tho George 15. Cluett, which had been
seat out for us, had been forced to
stop at North Star bay, about ona
hundred and fifty miles south of Etah,
because her propeller shaft had
broken. Dr. Edmund O. Hovey of tho
museum was on the Cluett, and ho ar
ranged with Mr. Peter Freuchou, who
has charge of the Danish exploration
base tit North Star hay, to take him to
Etah in a motor boat.
“On tlie morning of September 15,
when the motor boat arrived In Etah,
Mr. MacMillan had gone south along
the shore to hunt walrus and Doctor
Hunt had gone on a long trip north
after caribou. As it was imperative
that we start at once If we wanted to
get away before Hie Ice shut us In,
those of us who were at Etah got our
supplies aboard the motor boat ns
quickly its possible, leaving Mr. Mac-
Millan and Doctor Hunt to look af
ter things at Etah or Join us later If
they wished.
“We reached North Star bay and
the Cluett on September 17, but could
not start from there on account of a
storm which" held us two days.
“When we finally did start In tha
Cluett the Ice tit Capo York was so
Dart that we could not put through
and anchored in an extremely pre
carious position under the shadow of
a tall cliff tit the entrance to Parker
Snow bay. The captain made several
attempts to continue south through
the ice, hut we had to take refuge in
Parker Snow bay and the ship was fi
nally iced in there on October 1.
Start on Long Trip.
“Both Mr. MacMillan and Doctor
Hunt visited us there, coming down
from Etall by sleds, and It was deter
mined that four of us were to attempt
tlie trip by sled across Melville hay
and along tho coast of Danish Green
land to Holstenborg, a distance of
about 1,1100 miles, where we could get
the first ship out for Copenhagen. The
Cluett was so crippled that It could
not make the trip north to Etah.
“We finally decided to take eight
sledges, drawn by nearly one hundred
dogs, and the party was to he com
posed of Doctor Hovey, Mr. Alien, En
sign Green ami myself. We left Par
ker Show bay on January 1G aud made
Cape York the first day.
“On March 3 we reached Urainsk.
There we met tho high priest of
Greenland, Knud Balle, who was just
starting south to his home at Egedes
utlndc and who volunteered to guide
us. We reached Egedesrainde on
March 21 aud were taken into Mr.
Balie’s home as his guests. It was
decided that wo should remain thero
until the annual Danish mail loft to
catch the boat at Hokstenhorg.
“When the time came to leave it
was not deemed advisable to have all
three of us make the trip out. We
saw that it was possible to got one
man through aud it was decided that
1 should come.
“I reached Copenhagen on May 20.
When I got In torn h by cable with tho
National museum I was advised to
make arrangements for a relief ship to
go to Etah aud bring out the other
members of the party and (ho speci
mens which wo had collected. I final
ly succeeded lit chartering Hie Den
mark, a small steamship, powerfully
built for Ice work. They will get the
other members of the expedition lato
in the summer.”
