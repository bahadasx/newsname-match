Manning 996, Blease 409.
Bamberg county gave Governor
Manning a most flattering vote.
The governor received in this
county 996 votes, to 409 for
Blease. This is a more than two
to one vote, and is no doubt the
direct result of the excellent work
done in this county by friends of
the governor. Every box in the
county gave Manning a majority.

New Bathing Rules at Chicago
Beaches Find Favor.
Girlish bare legs on the municipal
bathing beaches stand approved.
Under the new rules governing
bathing at the city beaches, girls are
not required to wear stockings and
most of them don't.
"I haven't received a single com
plaint about the new bathing costumes,"
said Alderman Block, chairman
of the committee on parks, playgrounds
and beaches. "It appears
that bare legs are not as objectionable
as gaudy stockings."?Chicago

Rapid Drying Paint.
A paint called Lory paint, is made
in France by Lorilleux Cie, Paris,
which is claimed to dry very rapidly.
As many as three coats can be given
in one day. Tests were recently
made on the paint and the results reported
to the Societe d'Encourage\
ment in Paris. The paint is sold in
cans, already prepared. In one test
made with the paint at first a coat of
three quarts was put on walls at 9
o'clock, followed by a second coat of
three quarts at 12 o'clock. The first
coat did not roll under the brush
when applying the second coat. A
third coat of one quart was given at
2 o'clock. In regard to the lasting
qualities, in one case walls coated
with the paint show no sign of deterioration
after five years. The
price of the paint would be a little
higher in normal times than ordinary
zinc paint, but its advantages in

Badly Wanted.
The friends of Rev. "Billy" Sunday
tell a story illustrative of his
repartee.
Sunday was on the Trenton train
one day when a man near him began
to drink out of a bottle. Noisy at
first, the man after three or four
drinks became quite unbearable. The
revivalist launched at him an eloquent
sermon on temperance.
At the sermon's end the drinker
looked at Sunday steadily, and said:
"I'd like to give you a good punch
in the nose."
"My friend," the revivalist answered,
"charity begins at home.

Got in Free.
A little boy went to Sunday-school
for the first time. His mother gave
him a nickel to put in the collection
box. When he returned he had a
sack of candy.
"Where did you get the candy?"
asked his mother.
"From the stand around the corner."
"But what did you buy it with?"
"With the nickel you gave me."
"But that was for Sunday-school!"
. "Well," replied the boy, "I didn't !
need it. The minister met me at the i
door and got me in free. ?Christian

prayers for the dead.
Japanese Supplications for "Souls
Slain in Battle."
Unusual preparations were made
one morning in Shussanji, or the Going-out-of-the-Mountain
Temple, a
quaint little place of worship hidden
away in a labyrinth of crooked
streets in a poor quarter of Tokyo?
preparations for a celebration on the
Sumida river to pray for the repose
of the souls of all those slain in battle,
regardless of nationality, and to
scatter scraps of paper bearing the
image of Jizo Sama over the waves,
one for each departed spirit.
The chief priest, an aged man,
with his assistants and the supporters
of the temple, had been busy for
days in advance and all was ready.
The red and gold altar of Shussanji
was hejaped up with offerings of rice
and fr&it, and a plain wooden tablet
had been placed there bearing the
words:
"To console all those souls who
have passed into the beyond because
of war."
The old priest, his bald head
shining, clad in his coarse cotton robe
of gray, officiated before the altar,
and when the last prayers were uttered
the people formed a procession i
to the Sumida river, a short distance
away.
Near a bridge an unusual craft was
waiting, a deep cargo junk roofed
over with canvas bearing bold black
Buddhist symbols.
Quickly the parishioners embarked
and squatted down upon the cushions
spread over the bottom of the boat,
and the priest, the central figure in
the religious ceremony, as gray and
faded as the robes he wore, took up
his position in front of the altar. A
piece of soiled embroidery did duty
for an altar cloth, and there was set
up a tarnished stature of Jizo Sama.
The priest placed some sweet scented
squares of incense upon the coals
in a small brass brazier, and as the
clouds rose into the air the boatman
with his long bamboo pole pushed
off from the shore, the holy man's
voice was heard chanting?all the
worshipers, old women and young,
men and children, murmuring in undertone,
"Name Amida Butsu!"
Out unon the Sumida river the
ceremony of scattering the papers
was begun. Old and young with their
hands full leaned over the sides of
the junk throwing away the sacred
papers with the effigy of Jizo Sama
stamped thereon?each meant for
the solace of the soul of some soldier
slain in battle.?London Times.

Keep Muddy Water on Your Farm.
mi i i _i._ j j -
me larmer who ieis muaay water
run off his farm is a poor farmer.
Muddy water means water freighted
with the cream of our soils, with expensive
plant foods; muddy water
pouring down our creeks and rivers
V' I
means that somewhere soils are gullying,
washing, and wasting, and farmers
are becoming poorer and poorer
year after year.
Let's stop this waste. Let's henceforth
see to it that all waters leav
ft
ing our farms are clear and clean,
and not carrying with them plant
foods that have cost us hard work
and hard cash. Of course the excess
rainfall must be gotten fid of, but
let's make it go through the soil,
rather than over it; instead of letting
it rob us, let's make it work
for us.
Don't ever think this matter of
muddy water is not important; for,
in truth, it is so very important that
the farmer who neglects it is on the
road to failure. Soil maintenance
and soil building lie at the very
foundation of successful farming,
and the man who fails to look to
them, as his first, biggest and everpresent
job, had better seek another v'jfl
calling.
Muddy water and land washing / .
... .. .j ?
away really mean the same thing,
and the longer we study the problem
the greater faijth have we in winter
cover crops of crimson clover, vetch,
rye, or oats as a means of solving it.
Since the December rains began all
cotton fields unprotected by a carpet
of green have been wasting their very
best plant food elements. Tons and
tons of nitrogen, at $500 a ton, have
gone, lost to our fields forever. On
the other hand, the fields protected
by cover crops have not only held A
their fertility for the summer crops,
but where covered with the clovers
or vetches, have been enriched with
great quantities of nitrogen from the
air.
"Let's make the South a land of
painted farm houses" has long been
a Progressive Farmer slogan; now
we propose another: "A carpet of
winter green for every Southerni
farm." Our choice above all is crimson
clover, because it is not only a
legume, a nitrogen-gatherer, but it
is also well adapted to a wide range
of soil and climatic conditions. Next
comes vetch, which is a legume and
also does well nearly all over the
South. But if neither vetch nor clover
are grown, rye, preferably Abruzzi,
is an excellent winter cover and
grazing crop, making a very considerable
wintflr anH oarlv snriner errnwth.
If none of the above can be planted,
ordinary oats, planted in September
or October, will, even if plowed under
in March, be worth several dollars
an acre in keeping the land covered
and protected from the winter
rains.
,'A-?
So really t' ere is a wride list from
which a choice may be made?so
wide, indeed, that there is simply no
excuse for our leaving our fields in
their shameful nakedness. If you
can't plant clover or vetch, plant rye;
if you can't plant rye, plants oats.
And don't just plant patches; plant

it from an ugly brown to a bright

emerald that will be the talk of the
county. Progressive farmers everywhere
are doing this, and finding it
the road to wealth, and you, too, can
do as well.
"A carpet of green in winter for
every Southern farm"?won't you
help us make this ideal come true
by seeing to it that there is one on
your fields hereafter??Progressive
