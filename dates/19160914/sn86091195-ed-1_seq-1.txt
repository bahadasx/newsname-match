SCHOOL DIRECT
ORS INSTALLED
j^Thq school board met on Monday
evening, transacting the usual routine
of business before the annual reorgani
zation of the board. At the close of
old business the board adjourned after
listening to a few earnest recommenda
tions of J. H. Early, one of the retiring
members. E. A. Doiul was elected pres
ident for the years 1916-17, R. L. Arch
er, clerk, and C. V. Fisher, treasurer.
Nofear Davis and E. M. Hubbell were
installed as new members, and placed
on various committees by President
Doud. The board listened to reports
of school conditions and acted upon
several recommendations of the super
intendent, besides entering into a dis
cussion of the Gary system and its pos
sibilities.
The schools are already so crowded
that many transfers of pupils are neces
sary. New seats will be used to ac
commodate the overflow. At least one
new room and possibly three or four
will be added when the fall work is
over. The old gymnasium is being pre
pared to take care of two new grades.
There is an increase of over 20 per cent
in the grade schools and 15 per cent in
the high school, with every prospect
that this will be increased before the
end of tho month. A new grade school
house will be needed next year if pres
ent conditions continue.
The senior class of the high school is
the largest in the history of the town.
There are now 37 members with good
prospects of graduation.
PAVING COMPLETED
The street paving has been completed
and everyone in the paving district
that we have talked to are satisfied,
and the town certainly is apparently
improved. The paving plant is still
here doing work for private parties.
From here the Maguire outfit goes to
Idaho Falls, where they have a great
deal of paving to do. Next spring Mr.
Maguire expects to return to Blackfoot
and pave two blocks of East Main
street.
BURY THEIR BOY IN BLACKFOOT
Congressman McCracken arrived
Blackfoot last Fridey from Washington,
D. C., and brought with him the body
of his 16-year-old son who died in Wash
ington last winter. The interment took
place last Saturday when a number of
the friends of the family attended
Mrs. McCracken, who has been here
about ten days, accompanied her hus
band to Boise Monday.
ANOTHER BUSINESS BUILDING
Fred W. Smyth, a. traveling man, lias
bought the business lot on Taylor
street back of the Pierson grocery
which has long been owned by Markus
Blenkel. Dahle & Eccles lias the con
tract for the construction of a 2-story

GUN PLAY NOT MALICIOUS
B. A. Thompson and George Wright,
Jr., who reside about seven miles south
of Blackfoot between the rivers, last
week were in the probate court air
ing their domestic troubles. Mr.
Thompson charges Mr. Wright with
trespass ami threatening him with a
gun in a malicious manner, but Attor
ney Good, the defendant's counsel, con
vinced the court that the gun play was
not a malicious transaction and the de
fendant was discharged.
A FAREWELL PARTY
Miss Ruby Trullinger of Altamont,
Illinois, who has been a guest at the C.
E. Haynes home northwest of this city
for the past six weeks, is to be given a
farewell party this evening. Miss Trul
linger leaves on Saturday morning for
Weston, Idaho, where she will resume
her duties as primary teacher at that
place. During her visit at this place
Miss Trullinger has made many friends
who all join in wishing her a pleasant
and prosperous winfer.
FROM THE FRONT
East week James McKie received a
letter from France where he has a
brother on the firing line of the Euro
pean war who is numbered among
Germany's deadly allies. Mr. McKie
who is with a Canadian regiment says
France is a nice place to live, and that
the holdings are mostly small like those
of his native country, Bonny Scotland.

Do you want to see this town grow?
Do you want to see more money in cir
culation here! I)o you want more of
that money yourself? Then stop kick
ing and get out and push and build. Do
something yourself instead of leaving
everything for others to do. This town
is and always will be just what we our
selves make it, just ns the live wire
communities are what their own live
wires make them. 11011 can't cultivate
corn with a dead horse, and you can't
make a live town by simply telling oth
ers what they ought to do.
It may be true that the ways of wom
en are past understanding, but the same
is equally true of men. To prove this
statement, go out and spend half a day
on the street. Watch every man as the
women go by. Many of them will ogle
and stare and blink if six inches of ho
siery is in sight. That is, if the woman
is not of their own family. But if she
is, they will make desperate efforts to
engage the attention of other men until
the "sights" are no longer to be seen.
It depends, you see, upon whose pig
you have by the tail. That's the man
of it, and most men are just men.
Now that the strike is off, the next
thing we hear of will no doubt be a an
other boost in freight rates. This will
mean more boosts in tho retnil price of
verything, for it is not the roads or
the ilealers that pay the freight—it is
the consumer. If the manufacturer adds
five per cent to his prices, the whole
saler will tack on another ten or per
haps more, and there is no telling how
much more will be screwed from tho
public before it reaches the consumer.
FOR RENT
Large front room, suitable for lady
Or gentleman. Apply to Mrs. E. G.
Stultz, 512 West Bridge street.

FATAL SHOOT
ING SCRAPE
The Progress Hall, which for the past
several weeks has been used as a club
room for the colored laborers employed
on the streets, was brought to a sad
and sudden close Monday night. This
haven of rest and recreation for Black
foot's colored population was a combi
nation barber shop, bimkhouse, thirst
parlor and musical headquarters, where
a piano and other musical instruments
were kept. It was rented for this pur
pose by Brock Jones and Billy Bell, tho
former a sporting niggor and the latter
a shoe shiner. Monday evening.Charles
Caldwell, who has been employed on
the streets, got. in a row with Jones,
the sport, anil in the two-shot fracas
in which the colored sport received two
fatal stomach wounds, he lost part of
an ear and was otherwise badly disfig
ured. Several colored spectators, in
cluding a female were arrested as wit
nesses.
The body of the murdered man was
taken to the morgue where it was found
that, he had been fatally shot in the
stomach twice, but Dr. Hoover who
performed the autopsy was unable to
locate the bullets.
A coroner's jury spent Tuesday ex
amining the wounds and the sullen wit
nesses, and concluded their investiga
tion by charging Charles Caldwell with
the killing, and he was to have his
preliminary hearing today. The de
ceased was a prominent member of tho
colored sporting fraternity of Poca
tello, where he leaves a young octaroon
wife who is now here.
Money matters is the cause of the
murder.

INDIAN MISSING

Henry Fisher who met a mysterious
and tragic death in Pocatello several
months ago, has been missing from
home since August 28th. Ho was last
seen in the Bells circus in Pocatello,
anil his team was found in the Black
foot stable by Ralph Dixie anil taken
to his home where the missing man has
a wife and daughter. Fred, like his
brother Henry, was a drinking man,
and it is feared that while under the
influence of liquor he has met a simi
lar fate to that of his deceased broth
er.
A. R. Weston will leave in about tea
days for Minneapolis on business.
If you can't stay on this earth for
ever, at least leave a record for some
thing behind you.
