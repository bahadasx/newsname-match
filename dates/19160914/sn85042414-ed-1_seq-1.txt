EIGHT-HOUR LAW
MAYBEHARMFUL
Speaker Says It May Prove
Boomerang to Brother
hood Men.
Mackinac Island, Mich., Sept. 14.—
Samuel O. Dunn of Chicago, editor of
a railroad magazine and who acted
in an advisory capacity in the nego
tiations which preceded the passage
of the Adamson law, suggested in a
speech here last night that the eight
hour may prove a boomerang to the
brotherhood!?.
Mr. Dunn's remarks were addressed
to delegates to the convention of the
Railway Signal association.
"This law," said Mr. Dunn, "does
not limit the number of hours that
railway employes may work in a day.
It merely limits the number of hours
that the railway may require them
to work before it pays them a day's
wage. In other .words, It Axes an
eight-hour pay day, and not an eight
hour work day.
"It is certain that under this law.
If it should be upheld, the railways
would have, to pay a day's wage for
eight hours work, but is it not equally
obvious that the law prohibits them
from paying any employe in train
service a day's wage before he has
done at least eight hours work? It
says eight hours, no more and no less,
shall be the standard. It would ap
pear, therefore, that under this pro
vision if the railways should pay any
employe a day's wage for less than
eight hours' work they would violate
the law and subject themselves to its
pains and penalties."
GERARD AGAIN
ispce
German Press Attacks
American Ambassador for
Alleged Remark.
Berlin, Sept. 14.—(Via London.)—
The American ambassador, James W.
Gerard, again is under fire in a sec
tion of the German press, this time
for a remark attributed to him re
garding a speech made recently by
Dr. Gustav Stresemann, national liber
al member of the reichstag, advocat
ing amon'g other things, a resumption
of the submarine warfare.
Ambassador Gerard is quoted as
saying that he did not understand
how the representatives of districts
for which export to America was a
vital question could advocate ruthless
submarine warfare. The national
Liberal Press agency, in a communi
cation to the newspaper, takes the
ambassador to task for what Is termed
"unwarranted intervention in a purely
German question," and says that the
ambassador's remark is characterized
•by "that naive presumptuousness
which believes that the decision affect
ing Germany's political future will be
dictated by Germany's American ex
port- interests."
The paper declares that Ambassa
dor Gerard would do better to leave
to the responsible German authorities
the decision on what use is to be made
of the means at their command
against England, and adds:
"The art and manner in which Am
bassador Gerard—and not for the first
time—looks after British interests is
extremely characteristic of his general
attitude.
"The American ambassador, in re
ply, says that he never heard of Dr.
Stresemann's speech and certainly
never made any public utterance of
the nature attributed to him. His
attitude on the submarine issue, he
declares Is based on pro-American,
not pro-British motives.
HEADS SURGEONS,

The assurances were given in re
sponse 'to inquiries.

satisfactory, and that inquiries re

they have been considerably per
turbed, probably will not be pressed
further.

Danger of Sympathetic
Walk-out Not Over, They
Maintain.
New York, Sept. 14.—Despite the
maintenance of a regular schedule on
the subway and elevated lines of the
Interborough Rapid Transit- company
and the gradual restoration of service
on the surface lines, leaders of the
striking street railway employes de
clared today that they are far from
being defeated. They hinted that the
danger of a "sympathetic strike is not
yet over."
Following a parade and demonstra
tion by strikers, the question of a
••sympathetic" strike will be discussed
at meetings of the Central Federated
Unions of Brooklyn and Manhattan.
Strike leaders predict that resolutions
favoring a strike among trades allied
with the street railway employes will
be adopted.
WESTERN GUARDS
PROVE HARDIEST
Washington, Sept. 14.—An official
report by the war department shows
that one-tenth of the national guard
has been discharged from the service
on account of physical disability or
because of dependent relatives since
It was called into the federal service
by the president three months ago.
The report bears a striking evidence
that the west furnishes better soldiers
than the east. Of the 9,946 men dis
charged for physical disability 8,678
were from the eastern department,
and only 8 from the central' depart
ment. which comprises Chicago and
the middle yest. A total of 4,919 were
discharged in order to permit them
to support dependent relatives. Of
these only 934 were in the central de
partment.
War department officials said It
must he taken into consideration that
the eastern department furnishes 60
per c6nt of the national guard. Even
with this big enrollment the east has
more men discharged In proportion to
numbers than the west.
Analysing the disability figures
army officers could come to no other
conclusion than that the west raises
a hardier soldier than the east- All
guardsmen before they were muster
ed Into the federal service took the
prescribed physical examination. All
were on equal footing, apparentlv,
when placed on patrol duty. Yet.
practically one-tenth of the men in
the eastern department w^re unable
to stand up under the strain as
against only eight men among the
thousands sent from the middle west.
Kill Teuton Prisoners

diers told him three German infantry
men were stabbed on command of
Russian officers.
"Three Russian soldiers who are
now prisoners, say the commander of
their company repeatedly ordered
them not to take German prisoners,
but to kill them. A special order
issued August 2 says: 'Comrades,
when we attack every one shall keep
in mind that Austrlans may be taken
prisoners, but that Germans, as far
as possible, shall be killed.'
"Two other prisoners, German
speaking Russians, say that In July a
regimental order was read to them
forbidding them to take German pris
oners."
