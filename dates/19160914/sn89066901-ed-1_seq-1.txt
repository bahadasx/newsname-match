$3,000 Fire at'Bryant
E. H. Letter's general store at
I'ryant, together with the post
ofliee, which lie conducted in the
same building, xas destroyed by
tire of an unknown origin early
Tuesday " morning, entailing
loss of about' $;j,000. Nothing
was saved except the postal rec
ords, stamps and money and the
other articles which were in the
safe. Mr. Letter's loss is about
$2,200, with $l,i00 insurance
H. II. Ruin owned the burned
building. . It seems probable
that the fire was of incendiary
origin, aiinougii im r. iener saiu
i.i i t t ii . ; i
he knows of no enemies who
would do such a thing. There is
also a theory that the store may
have been' robbed and burned, al
though there is no clue. Mr
Letter was here Tuesduy and
stated that he would resume
business ut Hryant as soon as
possible. He lives about a mile
from the store, and when the
fire was discovered about 2:;!0
a. m." ov those living near tne
store, he was notified by tele
phone, but the fire had gained
such headway when discovered
that it was impossible to save
anything from the building. His
many friends sympathize with
him in his loss.
