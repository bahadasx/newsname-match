for a remark attributed to him re- jriuthrlo. and assures the American
gardlng a speech nuidn recwitly by Dr. government that tho new Uuhso

of the Reichstag, advocating among former coiivetitlons, and that the lm

Ambassador Gerard la quoted as
aaytiiR that he did "not omlerwtnnd
how the representatives of districts
for which export to America was a
vital quest Ion, could advocate ruth
less submarine warfure.
The Nntlnnal Liberal Press Agency,
in a communication to the newspa
pers, takes the amtsador to task for
what la termed "unwarranted Inter
vention In a purely German ques
tion." The paper declares Ambassador Ge
rard would do better to leave to the
responsible German authorities the
decision on what use Is to be made of
the means at their command against
Kngland. and adds:
"The art and manner In which Am
bassador Gerard and not for the first
time looks after Ttrltlsh Interests la
extremely characteristic of his gen
ral altitude."
The American ambassador In reply
says that he never heard of Dr. Strex
mann"s speech snd certainly never
made any public utterance of the na
Jure attributed to him. His attitude
on the submarine Issue, he declares.
Is based on pro-American, not pro
British motives.
