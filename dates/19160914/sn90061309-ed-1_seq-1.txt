Nigger Horsewhipped
Saturday evening the officers
were tipped off that Charley Smith
a very big feeling impudent nigger.
had hired a horse and buggy and
later been joiued by a young white
woman and the two had gone to
tne country in the buggy Soon all
roads leading to the city were
guarded. When Smith and the
woman were hailed she escaped in
a field but later was caught and
the two brought to town, when
Smith was placed in the city lockup.
This last act of Smith's was more
than the citizens could stand and
after midnight Smith was taken
out of jail, out of town and given
a good, much deserved whipping
and told to get away trora Monroe
City and then to stay away. The
woman was also told to get out of
town and she got There are other
roe City has several respectable,
deserving colored people who know
their place aud make good citizens
Then the city is cursed with a lot
of impudent, loud, profane, indecent
niggers both mule and female who
are a disgrace to any community
It is no use to haul them up before
the courts and fine or give them
jail semence for as they have no
shame and do not mind going to
juil. For all such a whipping post
should be provided by law. Moral
suasion in such cases is not as good
as the whipping post

GRACE BAPTIST
There was no preaching in morn
ing or evening at our church on
last Sunday. It had been decided
during the latter part of the week
that if no unforeseen obstacle arose
to prevent, uur services would be
dispensed with and we would go
down and listen to Bro. Hoy's fare
well sermon to his own people.
We went and were rewarded by
hearing a sermon that did our souls
good We found out that there was
considerable of the old time Meth
odist in us. There were times dur
ing the service when we felt the
stirring within us. of a good old
shout. The text u?e,i by Bro. iluy
is to be found in Paul's second let
ter to Timothy, Second chapter.
19th verse: "Nevertheless the
foundation Of God stand eih sure
having this Seal, the Lord kuoweth
them that arc his."
Sunday evening the preachers of
the town and the congregations
from the different churches took
part in a farewell service held in
Bro Hoy's church. Bro Gott was
master of ceremonies. The follow
ing men took part in the service
Melvin Nolen, Dr Goodier, Tom
Dawson. Will Ringquist, Rev. Trip
let!. Bro. Hoy, Bro. Gott aud I. The
services was enjoyed by all. The
thought of Bro Hoy's departure
alone added saduess to the occa
sion. We are sure success awaiis
him in his new field. He goies to
St. Joseph. Mo.
We feel safe in announcing serv
ices for next Sunday. The morn
ing sermon will be to the church.
The evening message will be evan
gelistic Our subject will be, 'The
Price of Hogs" Prayer meeting
