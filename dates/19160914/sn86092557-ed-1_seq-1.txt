' concerting to the Watson-Cornwell
coalition. That they had counted on
the Lilly-Robinson setto lasting till
the mlllinlum. or at least until after
1 the November election, was a fact obI
vIoub to the intelligent. They had
counted on keeping it going with methods
of their own. But the plan Is a
j plain failure right now. with the real
campaign between the two parties
yet to get systematically and enthusiastically
started.
Governor Hatfield will not be an issue
In the state campaign?not so far
as the Republican voters are concerned.
The opposition will try to make
him an issue, and will doubtless continue
as they have started to raise a
lot of dust around and about the personality
of the governor. They did
that with the late Governor Dawson,
and are heedless of the misfortune
which resulted. Dawson personally
was an athemo to the Democracy. Dawsonism.
like Hatfleldtsm, was painted
a horrible bogy man on the political
canvas. The Democrats may have
been as terrified as they pretended
to be, but the Republicans didn't scare
any worth mentioning. The bogy man
proved to be one of the best chief executives
West Virginia ever had, and
one can't get an argument from anybody
when he asserts that William M.
O. Dawson was one of the greatest
men West Virginia ever produced. It
is proper to leave to history the place
which Governor Hatfield will be accorded,
but the Republican state platform
doesn't back and fill on declaring
that his administration is one of
the best the state haB ever had. If
carrying out a progressive platform
crammed full of promises for "radical"
legislation counts for anything in support
of the case, it is won hands down
for Hatfield. He put every promise
over, and though some there are who
found fault with his methods, he put
'em over Just the same, and that was
what the voters of the state plainly
elected him to do.
A man in Parkersburg, and a Dem
ocrat of the safe and sane variety,
punctured the tire of his party's campaign
managers when he said: "It is
a waste of titac and energy for us to
try to keep up the bitter contest of
Robinson and Lilly for the governorship
nomination. It can't be done by
outsiders. If the fight wasn't bitter
enough to hold out in factional bitterness
of itself, there Is nothing that we
can do to prolong it, since those directly
concerned are putting it behind
them, apparently intent on getting together
and fighting it out with us in
the regular way. Our interference, to
my mind, will result only in bringing
about a result which we have been
hopeful would be avoided; that Is, the
harmonization and unification of the
Republican voters. No outsider ever
butted Into a family quarrel and got
away with anything that profiteth
him."
Strikingly similar was the argument
of the Fairmonter, another scion of
Domocracy who carries his head high
in the clear spaces and has no illusions:
"We can't beat the Republicans
by trying to make the personality of
Governor Hatfield an Issue. Some of
our people have been mislead Into
thinking that because Lilly made Hatfield
an issue. That was well enougth

in those circumstances. That was a t
party quarrel, a factional affair, and e
the trouble was a personal one be- b
twcen Lilly and Hatfleld. To believe t
that Cornwell can step in and take up I
a family spat where Lilly left oft Is t
absurd. Lilly has come out for Rob- I
inson and has urged his supporters In J
the primary to do so. Only a Repub- 1
lican could prolong that quarrel, and
there is no Republican so disposed.
As an issue there Is nothing In it. An .
issue is a vital principle and over it "
parties win and lose. Dr. Hatfleld Is
only a vital personality, which expires
officially in a few months. That's the
end of it. The sooner my party gets
down to cases and digs up some prln
ciplcs which mean something to the '
individual voter, which appeals to him '
seriously and to his sense of responsl- i
blllty as a voter the better It will be J
for it."
Aside from Hatfleldlsm, the Democrats
up till now are laying on heaviest
on the charge of "extravagance"
and increased taxation. These are old
friends as Issues go in West Virginia.
They have been fought over ever since
the administration of Governor White.
The Democrats have never won on
them, from which it may be accepted
as a fact that they never proved their
charges.
A number of men with whom I talked
predicted that Hatfleldlsm and the
militant Doctor will soon be dropped
by the Democratic managers. Tbey
will take a new tact. With the dropping
will go the silly charge, of course,
