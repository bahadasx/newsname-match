Necessary Steps.
Take
Washington, Sept. 12. Japan's
demand upon China for the em
ployment of Japanese military
advisers in large Chinese centers
in south Manchuria and inter
Mongolia and Japanese military
instructors in Chinese military
schools and colleges is viewed by
official here as a part of the new
Japanese policy which may
threaten America's policies of an
open door and the maintenance
of Chinese integrity. The state
department will await the nec
essary informat'on upon which
to determine its course., but the
opinion seems to be gaining

U. S. May Ship Entire Towns
Federal Experts Are Optimistic.
Chicago, Sept. 12.-When
Europe stops fighting and starts
to rebuild towns for her people
to live in, it expects the United
States to go to its aid. Already
plans are being made to buy not
only raw lumber b ut knocked
down houses, which will be ship
ped across the ocean and set up
not singly, but by the village. "
The initial step, by which the
United States government fee
the first time takes active part -
with American industry to go
out and get trade, to became a
traveling salesman and procure
orders, was tsken in Chicano,
when Dr. E. E. Pratt from
Washington chief of the bureaa
of foreign and domestic commer
ce, met representatives of the
federal trade commission and
twenty lumber companies to out- '
line a campaign for selling
American lumber to Europe.
Heretofore the government,
through consular reports cn
business and trade conditions, in
iCreign countries, has indirectly
aidea American manufacturers,
but in this-case the government
has provided for a" committee
whicn will go to Europe about
November 1 to invest ga.o con
ditions further and begin the
campaign with the foreign buy
ers. R. H. Dowman of New
Orleans, president of the Nation-
al Lumber Manufacturers asso
ciation, was chosen as the head
of the committee"?
, Reports read show that alt
Europe is practically denuded of
trees. In Belgium the forests
are entirely destroyed, and the
nation is so physically wrecked
that the rebuilding will have to
be financed by the major powers.
The plan cf rebuilding France
a3 outlined by the French gov
ernmental authorities, he said ,
is to have the towns and villages
on the community ' basis, with
mode.1 farms on the American
plan. It is planned to order
knocked down houses which ran
be set-up rapidly and in whole
sale quantities. 1 he r rench gov
ernment has already offered to
buy enormous quantities of rail
road timber on twelve months"
interest bearing notes.
The lumbermen said that the
shipment of large quantities ol
lumber would relieve ttrious
competition here.
Those at the conference were
H. S. Graves, head of the United
States fxri.-t service, and W. IL
Parry nod Joseph E. Davie of
the feiieia! trade commission..
