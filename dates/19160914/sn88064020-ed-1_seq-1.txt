BIG SOCIETY EVENT THANKSGIV
ING NIGHT.
Following the big Herald athletic
event on Thanksgiving Day there will
be the greatest society event ever!
taken place in Algiers. and our many
young people are looking forward to
this date to take part in the big ball
I that will be given by the members of
the Alhambra Gymnastic Club.
The preliminary preparations have
already been begun and invitations are
to be issued to the society people of:
all of our leading orisarizations.
It is not known yt hetller It alli
be a formal full-dress affair, but it has
been hinted by some of the boys that
the committee would not insist on
making it full dress, but that every
other thing would be carried out to
make it one of the social affairs of the
season.
Elegant invitations, best music ob
tainable, the largest hall available,
dainty ices and cakes, flowers for dec
oration will be some of the incidents
connected with this big social func
tion, and it will be a suitable winding
up to the Herald's big athletic tourna
ment, which will take place in Verret
street on the afternoon of Thanksgiv
ing day.
MAY BECOME FIREMAN.
Reports have it that Mr. Neumann
of Piana street will receive the ap
pointment as fireman at the new In
cinerating Plant. It is stated among
his friends that his name has been
settled upon, and that he will receive
the appointment.
Besides Mr. Neumann, the fireman.
and Mr. Verneuil, there will be two
other employees, we understand.
whose names have not yet been made
known, to receive appointments.
These positions will be, no doubt,
one helper and a porter.

OFF TO STUDY SURGERY.
I)r. Alfred C. King. of \'allette
street. left Friday evening for Roches
ter. Minn.. u here he will further per
fect himself in operative surgery of
the major class.
For the past three or four ,ears I)r.
King had been devoting his time to
surgery almost exclusively and fout
times each week he operates at the
Charity Hlospital. This gratuitous
service he has been giving for the
I benefit of the poor. Dr. King has also
been one of the lecturers on surgery
at the New Orleans Polyclinic.
.\t Rochester. Minn., where some of
the most difficult operations in this
tountry are performed by the Mayo
brothers. Dr. King will have ample
opportunity to watch the great ad
vancements that have been made in
this line of work. He was accom
panied on this trip by his wife, Mrs.
A. C. King. They will return about
Oct. 10th.
INTO LARGER QUARTERS.
The Citizen's lHomestead Associa
tion. who have many stockholders on
our side of the river, has been com
pelled to move into more commodious
quarters and are now located at 216
Baronnee street. on the ground floor.
The association was formerly lo
cated at 317 Hlennen Bldg.. but in
order to keep pace with the growth of
the association it was necessary to ob
tain quarters commensurate with the
business now being done by this thriv
ing institution. Mr. J. E. Keller. the
hustling secretary-treasurer of the as
sociation. wears a big, broad smile in
the new office and everything is just
as spick and span in his office on Ba
ronne street as it was in the liennen
Bldg.
Mr. Keller is also very proud of the
thirteenth semi-annual statement,
which has just been issued, showing
assets amounting to $203.086. This 's
a phenomenal growth in six years,. and
one of their big talking points is that
they have no real estate on hand and
that the amount of their money is ex
ceedingly small for the amount of
their assets.
NEW INCINERATING PLANT WILL
BEGIN OPERATION ABOUT
OCTOBER 15.
The new Algiers Incinerating
Plant will be receiving its machinery
within a few days, and the plant will
ne ready for operation about the 15th
of October.
A few weeks ago. the Herald pub
lished details regarding the dimension
of the plant and many other things
of Interest concerning it. Other inter
esting details of the plant are that
when completed it will cost $32.000.
It will have a capacity of 12 tone of
garbage a day, and will arse u able
to consume one dead animal, whether
horse or cow. every eight hours. The
big smoke stack, which is 120 feet
high, 10 feet at the bottom and four
feet at the top, cost $2300. An ele'
tric crane will handle new carts with
removable beds. The cart drives up
to the plant, the electric crane will
take the top off of the cart, and dump
the contents into the big incinerator.
This will save much handling of gar
bege. Big scales for the plant are
be.ia installed.
