KILLED SON-IN-LAW
Booth Sutlon Shot Br Sweeney Morgan.
At about seven o'clock Saturday
i night occurred one of the most regret
.able tragedies that has taken place In
Garrard County in a number of years,
when Sweeney Morgan killed his son in
law, Hooth Sutton, at the home of
Frank Holtzclaw, another son-in-law cf
Mr. Morgan, on Crab Orchard pike.
The facts as they appeared at the
Coroner's inquest seem to be as follows
Mr. Sutton had been drinkingand trou
ble occurred between him and his wife
at their home. Mrs. Sutton left home
and went to the home of her jister, Mrs
Frank Holtzclaw, who lives about two
or three hundred yards from the Sutton
home. Sutton followed and came to
the Holtzclow home with a shotgun.
Another quarrel ensued and Mrs. King,
a sister of Mr. Morgan interposed. At
this time Mrs. Sutton is said to have
gone to the home of a neighbor, Mr.
Bruce Lawson and telephoned to Sheriff
Ballard to come and arrest her husband,
At about this time Mr. Morgan is said
to have learned of the trouble from a
little aon of Mr. Frank Holtzclaw, and
with a shotgun, went from his home to
the Holtzclaw home, a distance of about
one hundred yards. On arriving there,
as testified by Mrs. King, Mr. Morgan
said, "Get up from there Grace", and
fired at Sutton, who was sitting on the
porch, from a distance of about ten
feet. The shot entered just over the
heart, cutting the aorta. Mr. Morgan
says that he shut in self defense, and that
Mr. Sutton was rising (rem his seat
and was about to shoot him. The body
was found around the corner of the
house about forty feet from the scene
of the shooting by the Sheriff on his
arrival, and beside it was a shot gun.
After the Coroner's inquest, Mr
Suttons body was' removed to his own
home and burial took place in the Lan
caster Cemetery Tuesday.
Mr Morgan was granted a guard until
after his examining trial, which will be
held today.
The parties of this tragedy were
prominent in tne community, Mr
Sutton being a well to do young farmer
and carpenter and a prominent member
of the Odd Fellows Lodge, while Mr
Morgan is one of the County's most
prominent farmers and stockmen. Mr
Morgan has engaged Judge L. L. Walk
er and J. I. Hamilton for his attorneys
and the prosecution has engaged J. E.
Robinson to assist the Commonwealth.
