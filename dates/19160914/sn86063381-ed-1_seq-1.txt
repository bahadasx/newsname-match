tracts between others from which the
timber has been sold and removed.
The proposed remnant sale will take
the form of county sales, because no
contract will exceed 100,000 feet,
and will be held about the time of the
big state sale at the capitol in De

JURY DECIDES WOMAN
ACCIDENTALLY KILLED
lET'S GO TO THE FAIR
(By Eugene Field)
In this week's history of the Fair,
Today will be the banner day.
The commonwealth will all be there
To view the truly grand display.
The country folk from miles around
Will gather in this monstrous hive,
And will in wandering groups be
found
Where pigs and cows and squashes
thrive.
The rural bumpkin and his gal
Will proudly note the Lima bean
And golden pumpkin from La Salle,
The sweet potato from Moline,
The toothsome cheese from Kannakee,
The turnip bred in Kickapoo
And squashes fair and round we'll see
From Crete and Big Foot Prairie, too.
Or, fancying live stock, they will
ponder
On blooded cattle by the drove
Sleek Berkshire bullocks from Gol
conda,
And Durham swine from Downer's
Grove
On Poland China sheep from Niles,
On calves from Buda and Urbana,
And likewise cows in divers styles.
Unhappy, most unhappy being,
Who thinks to stay away from there
Who misses all such eights worth
a. seeing
At and around our glorious Fair!
So don, O youth, your paper collar,
And prink your best, O maiden gay,
A picket costs but Half a dollar
Go join the multitude today!
