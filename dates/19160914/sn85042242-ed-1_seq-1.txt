CONGRESSMAN MANN
RECEIVES BIG MAJORITY
Close Race Between Lorimer and
Fulton for Rep. Nomination
For Congressman.
Chicago, Sept. 13.—Former Con­
gressman Frank O. Lowden of Ore­
gon, 111., and Governor Edward F.
Dunne, incumbent, were nominated
by large pluralities for governor by
the Republicans and Democrats, re­
spectively, in the Illinois primary to­
day, according to estimates based on
incomplete returns tonight.
Lowden carried Chicago by a plur­
ality of 40,000 over Morton D. Hull of
Chicago, second man, returns from
one-third of the city indicated. Frank
L. Smith of Dwight, 111., ran a poor
third in Chicago. Down state returns
indicated a heavy plurality for Low­
den, vfith Smlith/ running clqse to
Hull. Estimates based on incomplete
returns from the entire state put
Lowden's plurality at more than 150,-
ooo.
Dunne apparently carried Chicago
over William B. Brinton of Dixon, III.,
by more than 70,000, and running on
the basis of about two to one over
Brinton down state. Early returns
indicated Dunne's plurality over the
entire state would equal or exceed
Lowden's in the Republican race.
Brinton was endorsed by iRoger C.
Sullivan.
The nomination of William Elza
Williams of Pittsfield, 111., and Ever­
ett Jennings of Chicago as Democrat­
ic candidates for congressman-at
large seemed assured if their Cook
county plurality eflualr. that of their
early plurality down state. Former
Senator William E. Mason and Bur­
nett :M. Chipperfleld, both of Chicago,
were rolling up pluralities down state
for the Republican nomination for
congressman-at-large. Medill McCor
mick of ChicSg# was running fairly
strong in sonftT (counties.
Congressman1'dairies R. Mann, Re­
publican housed'leader, has been re­
nominated by'ii bip majority over
Rev. Melbourne1, Boynton, a Baptist
minister, who Avas backed by the An­
ti-Saloon league.
William Lorimer, declared not le­

gressman in the district from which
Lorimer served several terms in the
house, according to early returns.
Taken to Task by German Press
for Alleged Re
marks.
Berlin, via London, Sept. 13.—The
American ambassador, James W. Ger­
ard, again is tinder fire in a section
of the German press, this time for a
remark attributed to him for a speech
delivered recently by Dr. Gustav
Stresemann, National Liberal mem­
ber of the reichstagg, advocating,
among other things, a resumption of
the submarine warfare.
Ambassador Gerard is quoted as
saying that he did not understand
how the representatives of districts
for which exports to America was a
vital question, could advocate ruth­
less submarine warfare. The Na­
tional Liberal Press agency, in a com­
munication to the newspaper, takes
the ambassador to task for what is
termed "unwarranted intervention in
a purely German question," and says
that the ambassador's remark is char­
acterized by "that naive presumptu
ousness which believes that the deci­
sion affecting Germany's political fut­
ure will be dictated by Germany's
American export interests."

District.
Chihualfna City, Mex., Sept. 13.—
Constitutional forces, under Col. Cha
pa, encountered and routed, in the
Laguna district, a Villista band,
which left behind in its flight seven
dead and a number of horses, accord­
ing to reports received here today by
General Jose Santos.
The bandits, headed by Eligio Rey­

held their ground for nearly four
hours.
Villa is still in the Santa Clara dis­
trict, but. is carefully avoiding a fight,
according to the latest information
received here by General Trevino.
Peons in that section, who say they
have seen Villa, claim that the band­
it's condition has been made worse
by exposure to wet weather and con­

SETTLEfiSSTARTED
Commercial Club Initiates Fall
Movement for Prospective
Residents.
The Commercial club's fall cam­
paign for new settlers is well under
way. Personal letters, supplemented
by a vast amount of illustrated liter­
ature, published by the club, the
state immigration department, the
federal government and the several
railway companies interested in the
development of North Dakota, are be­
ing mailed to a select list of prospec­
tive settlers in Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Kansas.
Party rates to various North Dako­
ta points are given and explained,
and the importance of first visiting
Bismarck, where are located the
United States land, office, the office
of the state commissioner of public
lands and other important depart­
ments, is impressed upon possible
new citizens.
Emphasizing Personal Touch.
The campaign is being conducted
along somewhat different lines than
heretofore, in that a yersonal touch
is given all of the correspondence,
and the Commercial club is making
an effort to convince the homeseek
ers that it is interested in their wel­
fare and anxious to serve them, no
matter where they may choose to lo­
cate in the Missouri slope country.
The club is writing only to bona fide
farmers, owners or tenants, who will
form a desirable class of settlers and
it anticipates a' fair number of re­
plies.
Unsolicited queries as to farm land
and conditions prevailing in North
Dakota are coming in daily, in spite
of the damaging effect of the stories
which have been sent out so freely
elaborating on "crop failures" which
have failed to materialize.

General Discusses Many Subjects
With American-Mexican Joint
Commission.
CONSIDER CREATION OF
INTERNATIONAL PATROL
Mexican Delegates Explain Pur*
pose of Mining Decrees in
Controversy.
New London, Conn., Sopt. lev—Sug­
gestions as to what methods shall be
employed to establish p'epee on the
Mexican border were submitted today
to Major General Tasker H. Bliss,
U. S. A., by the American members
of the American-Mexican joint com­
mission. The officer's opinions were
sought on subjects ranging from the
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico to the possibility of creating
international police to guard the bor­
der. 'No conclusion, liovever, was
reached, and the comtn'siiioners will
continue tomorrow t^ieir conferences
with General Bliss.
The joint commission dealt today
wholly with questions raised by tax­
ation decrees issued bv Oeneral Car­
ranza, which affect American con­
trolled properties in Mexico. The
Mexican commissioners explained in
detail the purposes Di' the decrees,
insisting they were dssigned to pro­
mote the mining industry and not
drive out American capital and con­
fiscate its holdings.
Consider System of Patrol.
In their conference with General
Bliss, the American commissioners
took under consideration the advisa­
bility of proposing such a system of
border patrol that a part of the Mex­
ican troops now engaged in this duty
would be relieved for the pursuit of
bandits at a distance frr-m the line.
They considered, also, ihe attitude
of Americans living alon*.* the border
and obtained from General Bliss esti­
mates as to the number r£ soldiers
necessary to put into effe t'any plans
suggfistpt-
Even the international responsibil­
ities of Mexico were being talked
over, Mr. Lane said. It was noces
sary that all these things should ibe
considered in order that an enduring
government should be set up in the
distressed republic.
To Prevent Monopoly.
A statement issued tonight said
that the complaint of American min­
ing interests in Mexico has led up to
the present investigation. In explain­
ing the decree complained of, the
Mexican commissioners pointed out
that one of the main purposes that
the Carranza government had in view
was to prevent speculative and un­
productive monopolization of mining
lands by individuals and companies.
The Carranza government, it was
said, virtually has reversed the sys­
tem in operation during the Diaz re­
gime.

Anton Gress, Morton County,
May Have Contracted Dis­
ease From Horse.
Anton Gress of Morton county, the
owner of 19 head of horses recently
condemned for glanders, may have
died from the disease, declares Dr.
W. F. Crewe, executive officer of the
State Livestock Sanitary board.
Mr. Gress died in the hospital, from
what, was reported to be iblood pois­
oning, but later it was found that
his horses had had virulent glanders
for some time and the opinion pre­
vails that he caught it from them.
Dr. Crewe does not. believe that
the epidemic is as bad as was re­
ported. In Morton county 29 horses
have been killed, but 19 of these were
owned by Gress.
After Gress died his horses were
sold at auction. Some of the pur­
chasers reported that they looked
bad. Dr. Mackey of Mandan and Dr.
Jackson of Dickinson investigated
and found that they had the disease.
The sheriff was ordered to round
them up, the infected animals were
killed and all exposed placed under
quarantine.
Dr. Crewe believes that the out­
break has been effectively checked.

NEW PROJECTS
ADDED TO CITY'S
Bismarck's 1916 Improvements
Forging Nearer and Nearer
to Million Mark.
BIG DEMAND FOR
MODERN COTTAGES
More Than Two-Score Families
Looking for Every Available
House.
Bismarck's 1916 building record is
forging nearer and nearer the million
mark, reports the Commercial club.
Among projects commenced within
the past week are the foundation for
an eight-story addition to the Hotel
iMcKenzie and a fourth story to the
Bismarck Wholesale Grocery Co.'s
plant on Main street. Work is pro­
gressing nicely on the large Tatley
building at the corner of Fifth and
Broadway the Haggart building,
which is being erected by E. A.
Hughes, at the corner of Broadway
and Third, is almost completed as re­
gards the exterior excellent progress
is being made on the fhree-story dis­
tributing and assembly plant of the
'Missouri Valley Motor company, at
the corner of Main and Seventh, and
on the $80,000 addition to the Bis­
marck hospital, and only a simple
kink in the title prevents the begin­
ning of work on a similar building
for the Bismarck Motor company, at
the corner of Broadway and Sixth.
The Strauss building on Main street
is practically completed, and, al­
though the Rose apartments still
await the heating system, practically
every one of the eighteen apart­
ments is already taken. The Piersen
apartments soon will be ready for
occupancy, and a full quota of ten­
ants is assured.
Big Demand For Houses.
There is a demand right now for
.10 modern cottages, renting at $25
to $40 per month. If there is a sin­
gle modern, desirable dwelling vacant
in Bismarck, so^ne ty/o-score families
Tttoklflfc'' for a h$l* fiats'
failed to locate it. The probabilities
are that ground will be broken with­
in the next two weeks for a number
of five to seven-room cottages, whose
builders hope to have them enclosed
before cold weather sets in. The de­
mand for skilled labor in the building
trades continues, and every man who
can spread mortar or tack a lath or
lay brick or shoulder a hod or "mix
mud" is assured a job at good wages
for the next four months, at least.
Addition to Freight House.
A hundred-foot, reinforced concrete,
fire-proof addition to the Northern
Pacific freight station has ben un­
der consideration for some time.
Business at this point has almost
doubled within the last year. Present
facilities have been found absolutely
inadequate. Better accommodations
for the dispatching of freight are im­
perative. A conferenec between Nor­
thern Pacific officials and local ship­
pers will be held in the near future,
when the needs of Bismarck will be
ascertained. The Soo Line and the
Northern Pacific report that 1916 to
date has rendered by far the great­
est business in the history of Bis-:
marck.
The addition of a fourth story to
the Bismarck Grocery house will in­
crease storage facilities about 20 per
cent and will relieve a congestion
which during the last year has neces­
sitated the utilization of box car stor­
age. The Bismarck Crocery is one of
ITismarck's distributing houses, which
has shown a consistent, logical
growth from the date of its establish­
ment, but whoso development during
the past year has been especially rap­
id. Three other Bismarck wholesale
houses stand in immediate need of
increased facilities, which will be
supplied during the year.
Industries Seek Location.
The Commercial club has on its
waiting list three desirable industrial
projects, whose location here depends
only on tlie provision of suitable
quarters. Bismarck's need for an in­
dustrial and commercial incubator—a
large structure wherein space may
be procured by industrial and com­
mercial concerns not prepared to im­
mediately erect their own buildings—
is becoming daily more pressing.
Some Prospects.
Among other prospects for the fo!
lowing year are an important educa

There were evidences here today
that the Republican victory in Maine

Woman Last Year.
New York, Sept. 13.—Joseph Mul

here September 8, 1915, of Mrs. Eliz­
abeth Nichols, a wealthy widow. In­
formation obtained by detectives,
who yesterday arrested at Iron Wood,
Mich., Arthur Waltomen, alleged to

Allies Capture Trench System*
Placing Combles in Further
Jeopardy.
COUNTER ATTACKS
ARE UNSUCCESSFUL
Russian Attacks in the Carp&thi*
ans Have Been Re­
pulsed.
The French, north of Peronne, are
holding tenaciously to the wedge they
have driven into the German lines
east of the Bethune-Peronne road*
near Bouchavesnes. They hold in­
tact, too, the town of Bouchavesnes
and other points along the line cap*
tured in the offensive started Tues*
day. Their capture of a powerful!/
organized German trench system,
south of the Le Priez farm, near the
road, running west from Rancourt to
Combles, has put Combles In further
jeopardy.
Fighting in the region of Bouchav*
esnes has been sanguinary. Finding
that the French had cut their line of
communication from Peronne north*
ward, the Germans threw violent at*
tacks against L'Abbe wood and Hill
76, south of Bouchavesnes, and re*
took both places. The (French, how*
ever, returned viciously an attack,
and after hard fighting, some hanl
to hand, finally drove out the Ger­
mans and kept the ground they had
won.
Many Taken Prisoners.
In the two days' fighting, more thani
2,300 Germans were taken prisoners,
and a large number of guns and ma­
chine guns were captured.
On the British-Somme front the sit*
uation remains unchanged. South of
the Sojnme heavy artillery duels be­
tween the French and Germans con­
tinue in the region of Vernadovillers
and Chaulmes. Repulse of a German
attack near Fleury, in the Verdun sec*
tor, is reported by Paris.
Heavy Fighting Continues.
Hfcavy fighting continues all
the Macedonian front, but no import*
ant changes are reported. The Ital­
ians have joined in the fray west of
the Vardar river. Near Lake Butko
vo, Rome declares, they have driven
Bulgarian detachments beyond the
Demir Hissar Doran road. The Bui*
garians say, however, that the Ital*
ians were dispersed in this region
with a loss of thirty men captured.
The British, across the Struma riv*
er, south of Lake Takinos, have made
no further efforts to advance, and in
that region, there are no develop*
ments.
Repulse Russian Attacks.
In the Dobrudja region of liouma
nia, the Central Powers are going on
with their operations methodically,
according to Berlin. In Transylvania
the Germans have joined the Austri
ans near Hermanstadt and southeast
of Hoezing, in fighting the invading
Roumanians.
In the Carpathians, Russian attacks
along the entire front have been re­
pulsed, according to Vienna and Ber*
lin.
Russians Held Ground.
Petrograd says the Russians era
holding all the ground they have won
in this region. German aeroplanes
sank a Russian torpedo boat destroy­
er in the Gulf of Riga and attacked
Russian naval forces in the Black
sea, off Constanza, Roumania. Be­
sides the destroyer sunk, several oth­
er hits were observed in both the at­
tacks, Berlin Bays.
May Accept High Office.
London, Sept. 14.—Athens dispatch­
es say that the former minister of
justice, M. Dlmltracopulos, after
reaching an understanding with the
king, will put his views before the
Entente ministers and let their atti­
tude determine whether he will ac­
cept the premiership.
M. Dimitracopulos, the dispatches
add, is of the opinion that Greece's
departure from neutrality is the oplf
remedy for the present international
situation. He recalls the Greeko
Turkish war of 1897, when Premier
Delyannis incurred all risks to re­
establish unity in the nation, divided
then, as now.
British Forces Withdrawn.
London, Sept. 14.—The Britlshi
forces, which crossed the Struma riv­
er last Sunday, have been withdrawn
after having inflicted heavy losses to
the Bulgars, according to a report
sent by the British press representa­
tive at Saloniki.
