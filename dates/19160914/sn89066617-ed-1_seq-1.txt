Tonight.
LAST NIGHT'S PARADE
WILL BE HELD TONIGHT
The Capaha parade, which was
scheduled to make its initial ap
pearance last night, was postponed
on account of rain. The parade will
be held tonight and tomorrow night.
While the rain ceased before the
hour scheduled for the pageant to
appear, the streets were wet and
the wood block paving was so slip
pery that the management consid
ered it dangerous to attempt to
force the horses to pull the heavy
floats over the route.
A large crowd gathered along the
route of the parade, but soon be
came aware of its postponement
nd dispersed.
Al Boshek, the dare-devil aviator,
arrived in the Cape yesterday morn
ing, but the failure of his machine to
reach the city until late yesterday aft
ernoon, prevented him making a flight
during the afternoon as scheduled.
He will make two flights today. The
first trip will be made promptly at
noon and the second at 5 o'clock this
afternoon.
" Boshek is known as one of the most
fearless aviators in the United States.
He performs more feats of daring than
any sky-pilot that has ever visited the
Cape.
In each of his flights today, he an
nounced last night, he will perform his
famous loop-the-loop trick. He leaves
the ground, making one circle of the
park and then begins to ascend, climb
ing into the sky until he has reached
a dazzling height. He then kills his
engine, turns the nose of his machine
and permits the aeroplane to drop.
When it has gathered its best speed,
he flips it over and over until he has
fallen within 200 feet of the earth.
At this height, he starts the engine
and soars skyward again. This is his
best thrill producer, although he per
forms many other feats which would
result in his death were his machine
to suddenly refuse to work.
Boshek and his machine were due to
reach the Cape yesterday morning, but
the aeroplane missed connections by a
few minutes. The aviator made a
flight in Detroit, Mich., one afternoon
this week, after which he started for
the Cape.
He reached St. Louis last night just
nine minutes before the 9 o'clock Fris
co train departed. The officials prom
ised him they would delay their de
parture in order to get the machine
on board. When the hour for the
train's departure arrived, Boshek said,
the train pulled out. He was on board,
but his aeroplane was not. It reached
this city yesterday afternoon by ex
press. BASEBALL SCORES

Charles L. Kent is Picked up
Unconscious, But is Found
Not Badly Hurt.
RECENTLY UNDERWENT
SERIOUS OPERATION
Rider Left Hospital to Take Part
in Cape Races is Tenth
Accident.
Charles L. Kent, one of the jockeys
riding in the running race at the Fair
grounds yesterday afternoon, after
losing control of his mount, Battle-
stein, was unseated and thrown almost
immediately in front of the grand
stand.
He was picked up unconscious and
at first it was feared that his neck
had been broken. Medical assistance
was summoned quickly and the in
jured man was restored to conscious
ness in about an hour after the acci
dent. He was struck on the cheek by the
horse's knee and his left thigh was lac
erated by a hoof, but the hurts sus
tained are not regarded as serious.
After the rider had recovered suffi
ciently to permit an interview he stat
ed to a Tribune representative that the
accident was due to exhaustion. He
said that he was just recovering from
an operation for appendicitis, and had
only been out of the Memphis hospital
two weeks.
From Memphis he had gone to Ken
nett to recuperate, and while there re
ceived communication from a well
known Illinois horseman urging him to
come to the fair at Murphysboro to
ride in some of the races there. His
doctor admonished him not to ride
again for at least a year, and while
he went to Murphysboro, he refused to
do any riding.
When he came to the Cape, after re
peated requests, he consented to ride
in yesterday's race. The horses got
away on a false break and for that
reason it was declared necessary to
make the race the second time. Mr.
Kent stated that he was almost in a
state of collapse when taken from his
horse at the end of the first heat, but
after resting a few moments, conclud
ed to stay in the race to the finish.
While attempting to get away on the
second dash, he soon became weakened
in his efforts to manage his hoi-se.
When the beast bolted he was power
less to stop him, and finally when com
pletely exhausted, he lapsed into un
consciousness, and has not recollection
of any further happenings until he was
Lrevived an hour later and found the
attendants working over him.
He says that he cannot recall either
falling from the horse or being car
ried off the track, and in his twenty
five years' experience as a jockey dur
ing which time he has been disabled
and carried away ten times, he was
never before rendered unconscious of
his surroundings.
The incision made by the surgeon
in operating for appendicitis was open
ed in his struggles to control the horse,
and he was removed from the Fair
grounds to a surgeon's office in the
city, for further treatment.
The 2:2.1 pacing race resulted as fol
lows: Graustark first, prize $150:
Sailor Boy second, $75; Vcrlie Patchen
third, $45; Dixon Dillion fourth, $30.
Time of winner, first heat, 2:21; sec
ond heat, 2:15; third heat, 2:16.
The 2:15 trotting race resulted a?
follows: Adelaide Benson first, prize
$150; Robert C second, $75; Lena Mo
ko third, $45; Mr. Hinman fourth, $30.
Time of winner, first heat 2:18,2;
second heat, 2-18,2; third heat, 2:19,2.
The horses that will compete today
are:
During the 2:25 pacing race yester
day afternoon, Dale S., owned by S.
J. Wade of Benton, slipped in the wet
track as he was turning the Broadway
curve into the home stretch, and fell.
Before he could get up, Joe Fuel, own
ed by Councilman Segravcs, struck
him and this horse, too, was hurled to
the ground. Morgan W. Todd, owned
by Joe Wilson of Hot Springs, ran in
to the two fallen horses, one wheel of
the sulky passing over them. The
driver, whose name was Jackson
Thompson, was hurled out of the ve
hicle onto the track. The horse, with
out a driver, continued the race, fin
ishing first. After losing the driver,
SAYS HE'S MINOR AND
UNCLE SAM BOY, TOO
Uncle Fears Action Cannot be
Taken Before Lad is Send
to the Trenches.
Lester Housam, son of Clements
Housam, formerly of this city, has
communicated with relatives here, ad
vising them that he has enlisted in a
regiment of Canadian infantry, and
that orders have been issued for them
to sail for the scene of trouble in Eu
rope before the 25th of September.
He is anxious to secure a discharge,
and is urging his relatives to produce
with all speed the evidence necessary
to establish the fact that he is not only
a minor but an American subject as
well.
His uncle, Louis Housam, who lives
in this city, has sought the records of
the Local Registrar of the State Board
of Health to secure official proof of the
age of young Housam, who they say
was born in Cape Girardeau in 1899.
The birth does not appear on the
records, and the attending physician,
as well as the mother and the nurse,
have since died, and it is f oared that
the required proof canont be produced
in time to obtain his discharge.
His father now lives in St. Louis,
and is the only witness to positively
substantiate the record kept in the
family Bible, as to the age of the
young soldier.
Lester is now stationed in Montreal,
and unless he is successful in secur
ing his release, he will soon be on his
way to the European trenches.
His uncle, Philip Housam, enlisted
in the U. S. Army at about the time
Lester was born, and after serving one
enlistment in the Philippines his fam
ily lost trace of him, and years of dili
gent search and inquiry have failed to
reveal his whereabouts.
WAR CHANGES FUNERAL
-FASHIONS IN ENGLAND
London, Sept. 13. War economy has
changed the fashion in English funer
als. They have become simpler. Pro
tests are made against plumes, hears
es, expensive coffins and other orna
ments of the conventional burial.
The late Major Walton of Brighton
ordered in his will that no gloves, hat
band, scarfs and claks, "or other dis
gusting paraphernalia of the under
taker," were to be worn at his funeral
and the horses were to be brown, bay,
grey or chestnut.
An army Colonel writing to the
newspapers says: "A hearse is an ab
omination of stamped tin and tinsel."
London undertakers interviewed
agreed that people arc ordering less
expensive funerals, but predicted a re
turn to the old order after the war.
the horse broke from a pace and fin
ished the heat running. He was dis
qualified and given third place.

L B. HOUCK CONFERS
WITH REED FRIDAY
Cape Democrat to Arrange Date
for Big Iially Here in
October.
Louis B. Houck, president of the
Wilson-Gardner Democratic Club, will
depart for St. Louis this afternoon,
where he will meet Senator James A.
Reed tomorrow morning and decide on
a date for holding the big Democratic
rally in this city.
As Senator Reed will be one of the
principal speakers at the meeting here,
Mr. Houck will permit", him to select
the date most convenient to his itin
erary to speak here. Senator Reed is
the only Democrat of distinction who
has notified the Wilson-Gardner Club
that he will positively be present at
the Cape meeting.
Senator Ollie James of Kentucky
has been invited to be present and
make a speech, but he will not be able
to give his answer until he learns what
engagements the National Democratic
committee has made for him. If the
date of the Cape Girardeau rally does
not conflict with the arrangements
made by the national committee, he
will be here.
Local Democrats are planning to
hold the meeting at the Fairgrounds,
if the weather will permit. If not, the
speeches will be made at the Court
house in this city.
Th?re will be both an afternoon and
evening session. At the Fairgrounds
and old-fashion barbecue will be held
from 11:30 until all of the visitors' ap
petites have been satisfied. After the
barbecue is over, the speeches will be
gin. An improvised rostrum will be
erected in front of the grandstand at
the Fairgrounds, where the orators
will deliver their speeches. In the
evening the speakers will talk from
the bandstand in the Courthouse yard,
unless the weather prevents, in which
event the meeting will be held inside
the Courthouse.
The promoters of the rally plan to I
make it a Southeast Missouri event,
and a mammoth crowd is expected to
be present.
AMERICAN BEER POPULAR
IN FAR OFF JAVA
Chicago, Sept. 13. "War babies"
consist not alone of munitions, provi
sions, automobiles, rubber, nickel and
the many other things that enable men
to kill each other. War babies also in
clude perish the thought! American
beer! No? Well, lend an ear to Leo
Hymans of the firm of Hyman Bros.,
Ltd., of Samarang, Dutch East Indies,
who is in Chicago on business:
"Java," said Mr. Hyman, "wants a
lot of .your American products, and
there ' is one thing wa want badly
American beer. Before the war we
used to import German beer in great
quantities, but since we cannot get it
any more we have taken to American
beer. And right now in Samarang all
you can hear is 'Give me an Amer
ican beer.'
"To be sure, we use all kinds of
American manufactured goods. Your
automobiles are excellent and popular,
but the most popular of all American
goods in Java is American beer."
MISS DOROTHY BELL
IS REGAINING HEALTH
Cape Girl Now in New York
State With Mother-Due
Home Next Month.
Muss Dorothy Bell, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. George Bell of this city, who
has been seriously ill in a hospital in
Boston, Mass., has improved rapidly
during the past few weeks and is now
able to enjoy the eastern summer re
sorts. Miss Bell and her mother are now
spending a few 'weeks in New York
State, where the talented young wom
an is recuperating. She is able to en
joy motor trips and spends much of
her time out in the open.
While her health is not yet normal,
she is much improved and her phys
icians believe she will soon be improv
ed sufficiently to return to her home
in this city. Mrs. Bell expects to re
main in tne r,a.st until .miss uorotny
has fully recovered, when they will re
turn to the Cape. This will not be un
til next month.
Miss Bell, who has been studying
for a professional career in Boston
several years, suffered a collapse sev
eral months ago, due to overstudy. For
several weeks her condition was pre
carious, and she was removed to a hos
pital in the suburbs of Boston, where
she could escape the excessive heat.
This proved decidedly beneficial and
she rapidly regained strength. At soon
as she was able to travel, Mrs. Bell
escorted her daughter to a summer re
sort in New York, where they have a
host of friends.
TOLEDO AUDITORIUM
TO HOLD PRIVATE CARS
Toledo, O., Sept. 13. The Toledo
Terminal Building is being remodelled
so that Todelo will have a convention
hall with a seating capacity for 5000
people, where big theatrical and oper
atic works will be given.
One wing of this monster auditorium
building is now being fitted up with a

duction. Special cars carrying scenery, as
well as private coaches, may be switch

scenery and baggage unloaded directly
on the stage, while the company may
use their private cars for dressing
rooms if they desire.
BURDETTE STATION ROBBED
Thieves Enter Depot to Steal Package
of Whiskey.
A telegram received by the police
of the Cape last night stated that the
Frisco depot at Burdette, Ark., was
robbed early last night. The depot was
closed while the agent was at home
for dinner, and when he returned he
discovered that the building had been
entered and ransacked.
The thieves entered the building by
removing a pane of glass. An express
package of whiskey was stolen and
the robbers made a hurried examina
tion of every article in sight, but the
whiskey was the only express that had
been taken.
ana Dunne is Renamed
by the Democrats.
LORIMER IN CLOSE
RACE FOR CONGRESS
Mann is Renominated and
McCormick is Picked or Con-gressman-at-Iarge.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Chicago, 111., Sept. 13. Frank O.
Lowden, was nominated for Governor
by the Republicans in the state-wide
primary, and Gov. Edward F. Dunne
was renominated by the Democrats.
Each won by large pluralities over
their opponents.
Richard J. Barr seems to have won
the nomination for Attorney-General
on the Republican ticket over E. J.
Bmndage, the City Hall candidate.
Barr ran with Lowden in the down
state districts. Several fights took
place at the polling places in this city,
and the police were kept busy all day
long.
One feature of the primaries was
the heavy vote polled by the Repub
lican party. The vote cast in the state.
according to the returns now in, is j
about the normal vote polled by the i
Republican party prior to the split
over Roosevelt four years ago.
Former Senator William Lorimer is
running Arthur W. Fulton a close race
for Congress. The vote is so close
that it will not be known which cap
tured the honor until all of the votes
are in.
Congressman Mann, the Republican
floor leader in the National House of
Representatives, has been renominated !
by a large lead, and it seems that Me-
dill McCormick has won the nomina- i
tion for Congrcssman-at-large.
In th Eighteenth Ward, ground of
many historic battles, the first blood
shed occurred between the Dunne and
Sullivan partisans. William Heller, a
Sullivan follower .who was working for
William Bi inton for Governor against i
Dunne, was stabbed in the hand. His
assaiant escaped. Heller war, takr. !
into custody. j
In the Kenwood district a fist fiirht
took place over the candidacy of E. L.
Brundage, Republican candidate for j
Attorney-General. When it was over i
Attorney C. I.. Day was taken into ciu - j
tody. There were many other clashes
between ward workers, but none ?.p- j
nroached the dignity of a riot.
LORIMER TRIES "COMEBACK"
IN CHICAGO PRIMARIES
Chicago, Sept. 13. "Rill" Lorimer is
trying a "comeback" today. Shorn of
all his former power and influence in
Illinois politics, shunned by the men
whom he "made" politically rnd dis
trusted by the many who lost tho:t
pavings in the collapse of his La Salle
Street bank a few years ago, the for
mer United States Senator is makins
a strenuous effort to get back into the
political game and regain his former
laurels. "Big Bill" is a Republ.ran
candidate for the nomination for Con
gress from the Sixth Illinois d;st -ict
in today's primaries.
The contest is holding th attcnti'-n
of a great deal of the Mi lill? West.
He has received no support from the
Republican national or state eomrr it
tees. He is making his fight alone,
save for a few friends who stucT: wi-ft
him during the stormy days which cul
minated in the loss of his seat in the
United States Senate. They are i
nancing his campaign, and thpy de
clared today that he will gain t'.
nomination, whether he is elected or
not.
Just what would be the repult if
Lorimer should be nominated is pro
viding food for much speculation in
western political circles. The former
Senator has many bitter enemies in
Illinois politics, who, it is believed,
would not support hm for election un
der any circumstances.
Lorimer is sincere in his determina
tion to re-enter "the game."
"It may be that I shall not succeed
this year," he declared, "but William
Lorimer will yet sit in the national
congress from which he was ousted
by scheming enemies."

ITKKS ATLANTA HORSES
Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 13. Miss Ruth
Corker, l years old, of Ornowood
Bark, a suburb of Atlanta, is the only
girl veterinary surgeon in the world.
Treating mules for lockjaw or sow
ing up huge cuts in horses legs is
child's play for this girl, who learned
her profession through her father and
grand father, both of whom are veter
inary surgeons. She has a large num
ber of animal patients.
"It takes a barrel of chloroform to
put a mule to sleep," said Miss Corker.
"So I rope them down, inject cocaine
locally and operate."
Miss Corker is very pretty, with
dark brown hair and hazel eyes. Sfte
wanted to do "something different"
from other girls, she said.
This is a new and entirely unexplor
ed field for women. There are women
physicians who specialize on human
patients, but so far as is known this
little girl is the only feminine "horse
doctor" in the world.
Miss Corker is very much in love
with her work. She has acted in the
capacity of helper to her father for so
long that there is nothing in the line
of animal ailments that see is afraid
to tackle.
Miss Corker expects to oper. an ani
mal hospital in Atlanta as soon as her
father is able to dispense with her
services. She is very confident that
she can make a success of it.
