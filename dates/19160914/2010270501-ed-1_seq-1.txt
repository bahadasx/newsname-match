Many Fine
Box Butte county Is again In the
liaaelight because of the showing
ade at the state fair. The exhibit
Mils year did not score aa many
points as In some former years but
lore premiums were secured. The
ahlbit was not eo large as last yeur
tmt the quality was high class, aa tn
results prove.
E. T. Kibble, who has taken a
sroat interest In boosting the merits
mi Box Butte county, was in charge
of the exhibit and was assisted by
his son. Nearly every one who in
spected tho Ehow was enthua'jipf.ic i
raise of the quality of the product?.
The same exhibit will be shown at
the Box Butte county fair. It will
ke necessary to supply fresh vegeta
bles, but the sheaf display will be
preserved Intact, for the county ex
position. The premiums received as report
ed by Mr. Kibble are as follows:
First on alfalfa seed in the sheaf.
Second on two kinds of potatoes, one
of the exhibits made by. Bud Betzold

"Bliss Triumph" variety. A second

ad on macaroni wheat; second on
two kinds of cucumbers; first on

gree of excellence.

JOY RIDERS ARRESTED;
YOUNG MEN PAY FINES
Tuesday night the pastor of an
Alliance church called the attention
of Marshal Wheeler to a party of Joy
riders. There were three young men
and two girls In the party. The
men were from a neighboring town,!
and it is said they belong to good
families. The girls reside In Alli
ance and are rather young to be In
such fast company.
Marshal Wheeler placed the young
men under arrest and they spent the
night in the city Jail. In the morn
ing. In police court, they entered
pleas of guilty for disorderly conduct
and were assessed fines of $10 each.
The party left the city in a cur at
about 8:30. The lights on the ma
chine got out of onier and they re
turned to the city for repairs. It
was while here to get the lights fixed
that they were taken in tow by the
police. One of the young women was
badly Intoxicated but the ot'ier one
was not seriously affected. All of
the party had Indulged in too much
booze.
Instances of this sort are not In
frequent in Alliance and the authori
ties are determined to put a stop to
the disgraceful conduct. The par
ents of some young people could help
a good deal by co-operating with the
police.
COUNTY SKAT FIGHT

Process of Incubation for the past

out the United 6tates.
Mr. Anderson has charge of the
work of the county agricultural
agents in Nebraska. He has been
woiklng for some time to secure this
service for northwestern Nebraska.

ed the work of the police required
their presence in the soutii part of
the rltv a great deal and that It
would be a great convenience to have
the signals put in so the police could
be called to the central station when
needed. The council agreed with
the statement of the marshal and
the gong and light will be installed.
The council confined the project
to extend the wires to the fair
grounds so the grounds and build
ings can be properly lighted during
the county fair.

dressed the council and asked them
to pay the $300 which whs due the

The mayor called the attention of
the council to Iho fact that the re
port of the light department shows
smaller net receipts than usual be
cause ho had held up n warrant f
$700 which the Light department
had charged the Water department.
He thought this was simply trans
ferring from one to the other need
lessly but of course tho net earnings
of the Light department would bo
smaller In consequence.
The mayor also mentioned the
fact thut the money In the city treas
ury was not up to the usual standard
at this time of the year but' he had
been assured by the county treasur
er that It was becauso of the slow
ness of the people In paying In their
taxes and he also had been assured
by the county treasurer that there
would soon be more money In the
treasury of the county which would
be turned over to the city treasurer.
The report of the various city of
ficials were read and placed on nie.
The claims agflinst the city as ap
proved by the finance committee
were ordered paid and warrant
drawn on the city treasurer for th
same.
The council then discussed a peti
tion for exteusion of a sewer on
West Third street and the matter
was held In obeynnce for further In
vestigation. The mayor brought up the petition
for 30-lnch cement gutters along Box
Butte avenue from First to Seventh

clerk for special assessment on the

thought beHt to nnd out whit the
wishes cf the property owners were
in recant lo additional curbing at
