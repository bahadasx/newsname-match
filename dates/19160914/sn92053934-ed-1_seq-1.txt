able carl? today. Until are veteran
campaigners.
Complete returns from Cook coun

given out which were barer! on esti
mates from early reports.
Frank o. Lowden. republican, and
Governor IMward F. Dunne, demo

while Lowden's plurality over Hull,
i: is believed will be about So. 000.
The plurality of Oglesby, republi
can candidate for lieutenant governor,
Will In- about i 5e,ioo.
Enimvr.-r.n's plurality in the race for
'he rfpuhiian uoininat ion for secre

i.fl.Oi'" while Kussel. republican candi
date for state auditor, apparently has

Fmall's plurality over Keys for the

urer is estimated at 30.0ihi.
The race between Brundage and

45.307 h'!" Barr apparently has car
ried the downstato by about 45.000.
See "Come Rack" of Mason.

tween Huttman and O'Hara for tho
Domination for lieutenant governor is
("lose and the result in doubt. Hutt
ffian carried Cook county by 5.525 and

that plurality. Morton D. Hull and
