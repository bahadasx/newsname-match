HOPEFUL OF NINTH DISTRICT
Delivers Address to State Com

Elector-at-Large.
"I predict a .splendid Wilson victory.
Nowhere, so far as t ran see. are there
j indications that our great President
1 will not be re-elected by a safe ma
jority. if thf people of this country
have any appreciation of wonderful
j achievements and of strict fidelity to
parly pledges, they will be compelled
to respond to yur appeal for continu
ance of the administration.
"With President Wilson to direct
and to give his wise counsel, the iii'iro
cratic Congress within a period of four
years has carried out the most con
structive legislative program that, in
my opinion, has been effected during
the last forty years The record of
t he administration has been nothing
short of wonderful, and thf peopl?%wlll
not fall to continue it."
Thus spoke Senator Thomas S. Mar
tin, senior Senator from Virginia and
one of the foremost Democrats of the
nation, in addressing last night at
Murphy's Hotel members of the Demo
cratic State Committee and prominent
party men from every section of the
State, gathered, specifically, to elect
a successor to Senator K. he* Trinkle
as elector-a t-la rge from Virginia, and.

"If the- Ninth District." he said, "isn't

are worth it. Though they have tasted
defeat time ard time again, they never
have become discouraged, and are just
as loyal and patriotic no v is they
ever were.
"I am Koine into the district myself
and do everything in my power to help

"I have been to the Ninth District."
he said, "and those folks out there are
really in earnest, and are firm in the
belief that they are going to win.
There is an air of optimism that you
can't get awav from. And they will

memhers of the American-Mexican joint

| xvitlidra *A aI of American troops from
I Mexico t<> tli" possibility of cteatiiiK

I horde ?.
The Join commission dealt to-da\
wholly with ?lUestions raised by taxa
tion decrees i.-sued by Cieneral "'at.
ran/a which affect American-controlled
miiiinc properties in Mexico. An ex
haustivc study of the situation was
begun The Mexican commissioners e\.
plained in detail the purposes of the
decrees, insistitii: that they were de
signed t" piotnote the mining industry,
I not to drive nut American capital and
cotilis' at ? its holdinss.
In theit conference with (Jeneral
Itliss. the American commissioners took
under consideration the advisability i>f
proposing such .1 system of border
patrol that a part of the Mexican
; troops- now engaged in this duty would
bo released for the pursuit of bandits
| at a distance from the line. They con
sidered also the attitude of Americans
living alotm the border, as reported by
?tieneral I'.liss. and obtained from that
i oflieer estimates as to the number of
soldiers ne-essary t<? put Into effect
any of the plans that have been sun
I vested.

l>i.-"?*ussins the wider aspects of the
commission's work. Secretary l.ane
snbl to-nisht it was probably unique
in the history of international 1 todies
in that it was j*oing into all that con
cerned the lift- of a nation, its economic
problems, its political struggles and
every phase of government. It was
possible, he said, that no conclusions
would be reached as to many of the
thiiiKs discussed lie added, however,
that the Mexicans would ha've knowl
edge of the views held in the United
States as a result of the deliberations*,
while the American commissioners were
cleaning a wide knowledge of condi
tions below the border.
Kven the international responsibili
ties of Mexico were being talked over,
Mr. I.at.e said, ami it was necessary
that all these thincs should be con
sidered. in order that an enduring pov
1 eminent should be set up in the ilts
t ressed ! epublic.
A statement issued tn-nisht said that
tiie . omplaints of American mining in
terests in Mexico had led t?? tlie present
investigation. In explaining tlie de
crees complained of. the Mexican com
missioners pointed out, the statement
asserted, that one of the main pur
poses which the ('arra nv.a government
i had in view was to prevent specula
tive anil unproductive monopolization
of mining lands by individuals and
companies The I'arran/.a government,
it was '-aid. virtually lias reversed the
system in operation during the I'tiavi
:? gim>
IN (ll'KIt A *1*1 (? N
it r.\ i:its|.;i> iiv * Aititw/, \
Under the i>ia-/. plan, tlie rate of taxa
tion on minitis claims diminished in
direct ratio to the number of claims,
whereas under the Carranzu plan the
put pose i> to encourage the staking of
relatively small number of claims
whii-li will !>?* actually operated and
to discourage the holding of larce
facts of mining land simply for specu
lative purposes.
Another series of complaints bail to
do with the attempts of tlie Carran/a
government to compel merchants to
accept paper currency at a rate far in
excess of its current value. The atten
tion of the Mexican commissiom-rs was
directed to instances in which military
commanders had. through decrees,
threatened with death any persons who
refused t o accept paper currency at
its par value, and for a similar offense
had also threatened merchants with the
confiscation of their property. The
Mexican commissioners pointed out that
in so vast a country it was humanly
impossible to guard against all possi
ble abuses, hut they laid emphasis on
the fact that, while such extreme de
crees hud been issued by subordinate
military commanders, the national gov
ernment has constantly urged modera
tion on the state ("inventors, and that
they iind no record of a single instance
in which any of these extreme penal
ties had been inflicted.

The whole hearing room, though m

that an unanswerable case was brin.g
made in bohnlf of the Virginia capital.

When the Richmonders arrived in

absolutely silent while Mr. Itranch read
the brief and while Mr Morgan briefly
