ATTENTION TO OTHERS
Third Degree Methods Used to Put
Men In ®tng Sing Prison After
Crimes Have Been
Committed.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK. Sept 14.—With the
confession of Joseph Mulholland, of
the part he and three other men
played in the murder of Mrs. Eliza
beth Nichols, cged wealthy widow, a
year ago, another chapter was added
to N4w York's remarkable record of
convictions
in
which every effort is
now being made to show that inno
cent men were sentenced to death or
life imprisonment
The confessions of Mulholland and
ArthUT Waltonen, arrested in Iron
wood, Mich., absolve Onnie Tallas
from actual participation in the mur
der of Mrs. Nichols. But Talles, a
mere youth, ia now in Sing Sing, sen
tenced to life imprisonment.
Two other cases which have at
tracted wide attention are those of
Charles F. Stielow, convicted of the
murder of Chas. B. Phelps and the
latter's housekeeper, and Thomas
Bambrlck, sentenced to death for the
alleged murder of Policeman George
Dapping here.
Stielow has been snatched from
the death chair repeatedly and an
other man was finally found who
confessed to the murders, though he
later repudia-.ad his statement. Bam
brlck Is sentenced to die tomorrow
morning. He was saved at the last
moment only a few weeks ago by a
court order. Owing to the discovery
of new evidence District Attorney
Swan intimated today he might ask
for another reprieve for ^ambrick.
Affidavits have been received indicat
ing that Bambrick may be innocent
Frank Meehan, now in Sing Sing, has
sworn that he saw Dapping killed and
that a tall man shot him. Bambrick
measures only five feet five Inches,
and when taken before Meehan the
latter swore josltively he was not
the man who killed Dapping.
Fifty affidavits were filed at Albion,
N. Y„ yesterday intended to show an onlooker,
that Stielow is not guilty of the mur
ders for which he is sentenced to
die. Stielow's confession Is declared
to have been dragged from him by
third degree methods and two Sing
Sing prisoners stated in their afflda
vita that Stielow is susceptible to in- t^ives of 125 cities
fluence of stronger characters and
tinder threats would likely say what
ever was suggested to him.
The confessions of Mulholland and
Waltonen are regarded by the police
as completely clearing up the,Nichols
case, which 1-as always retained an
element of mystery. A third man im
plicated is. still at large. Mulholland
and Waltonen told how they tried to
pet Tallas to kill the wealthy widow,
but he was afraid. They then over
powered and bound him and' rushed

[United Press leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.—Four
naval authorities today umpired the
liveliest land battle they ever saw,
the $11,000,000 prize contest for the
government plate plant site. Six
score and a few odd cities are par
ticipating. Each contesting city nas
all the advantages needed for any
first class armor plate factory and
according to her earnest orators, has
them to a degree not equalled by any
other.
The naval authorities. Secretary
Daniels, Asssistant Secretary Roose
velt, Admiral Benson and Rear Ad
miral Strauss, heard arguments yes
terday of the cities in states that
began with Alabama and continued
alphabetically down to Rhode Island.
Today, Providence, R. I., opened the
engagement Tennesse, Texas, Vir
ginia and Wobt Virginia cities were
to be heard before dark.
The cheapest fuel, the best trans
portation, the most accessible de
posits of ore, the highest class of
labor and the beat working conditions
were common attributes of all the
cities represented. Some threw in
the finest climate for good measure.
The naval men are giving serious
consideration to all the points made.
They have to balance against the ad-1
vantage of deep water harbors on the
coast, the danger of attack by a
foreign enemy and sthe inland citle
orators are making the most of this.
With this element of danger removed
it is generally agreed the coast cities
competing, for the plant would have
all the advantage.
One instance of real team play de
veloped today. Bristol, Tenn., wants
the plant. So does Bristol, Va. It'
the Virginia Bristol loses, her hope
is that the Tennessee Bristol wins.
The only division between them is
the state line, the two cities being
pretty much the same place, except
for that imaginary line.
No established steel company has
accepted Secretary Daniel's invitation
to make an offer of sale. The invita
tions were sent out in accordance
with the terms of the law which gave
the secretary authority to build, or
buy a "second hand" plant

Today marked the opening of the

It is the president's opinion as well

There was a distinct air of optim
