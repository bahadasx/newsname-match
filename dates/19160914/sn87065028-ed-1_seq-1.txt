Yates, Commander Expected
Following a preliminary gathering
of local citizens which wax held nt
the city hall several weeks ago for
th purpose of taking steps towards
forming a local camp of Sons of
Confederate Veterans, a second
meeting will be held at the same
place at 8 o'clock tonight, at which
time permanent organization will be
- effected.
At the initial meeting it was de
cided to invite General N. B. Forrest,
of Biloxi, adjutant-general of the
- Sons of Confederate Veterans, and
General A. L. Yates, of Columbia,
commander of the Mississippi Divis
ion, to come here and deliver ad
dresses, and on yesterday a telegram
was received from General Forrest
in which he stated that tonight
would furnish his last opportunity to
appear here, as he expects to leave
soon for the north and will be ab
sent several weeks. Upon the receipt
of this letter, a telegram was sent to
General Forrest, asking him to come
here tonight and a similar message
was also sent to General Yates. ' It
is practically certain that General
Forrest will be on hand, while it is
hoped and believed that General
Yates will find it convenient: to ac
cept the invitation. . I
It is to be he4 that (sctre co vd
will attend the meeting tonigty;, as
the Mississippi Division of the United
Confederate Veterans is to hold its
annual reunion here early in Novem
ber, and it is very important that
Columbus should have a camp of
Sons of Confederate Veterans before
that time, as the two organizations
are co-ordinate, and "the veterans will
during their meeting here transact
b great deal of business that will be
interesting to the descendants of
those who participated in the great
internecine struggle.

NATIVE WM TELLS OF
THOMAS F. MAYO DESCRIBES
IN LETTER HOW WOUND
ED ARE CARED FOR.
I
.A Rhodes scholar from Mississippi,
Mr. Thomas F. Mayo, son of Col.
Jno. P. Mayo, who was for many
years a prominent merchant in this
city, but who is now commissioner
of immigration at New Orleans, in
a recent letter to his uncle, Dr. Cas
well A. Mayo, secretary of the New
York Medical Journal, from Neuil-
ly-sur-Seine, tells something of the
work of the Allies' ambulance corps
of which he is a member. He says:
"You needn't be surprised at any
address you see on my letters nowa
days, for there are so many things
to do and so muny places to go that
it is impossible to know what is com
ing up next. At present I am learn
ing to drive an ambulance and in the
meanwhile riding about as second
nan on another fellow's machine.
Our business is to carry the 'blesses'
from the trains to the various hos
pitals in and around Paris.
"Last night we had a' call from
the Gare du Nord to meet a load of
200 just rolling in from the Somme.
My three roommates and I were loll
ing about at about 10 o'clock, when
the 'chateau,' as we call our dormi
tory, and we were told that we must
be at the ambulance yard in half an
hour. We all wear khaki uniforms,
which involve wrapped puttes, which
in turn involve much mental anguish
and all sorts of profanity, but we
managed to get dressed and out fi
nally, 'and down to the yard right on
the dot.
"I went down with Woodruff, of
Texas, who was driving a car new
to him, but we went at a pretty stiff
rate right through Paris. We dashed
through the Monmartre district, and
our staring big lights lit up some in
teresting tableaux, so to speak, for
the streets were rather dark. There
was a line of twenty cars, and it was
a pretty nice sight to see us cutting
along. Everybody comes to the edge
of the sidewalks and stares at the
wild Americans, and all traffic gives
us pretty much what room we want.
The wounded soldiers were not
very badly shot up this time, and
were very patient, and cheery con
sidenng that their wounds were a
day old, and that there was neces
sarily a good deal of jolting as we
moved them. But I must say that
the whole business of unloading and
transporting, was well handled. The
hospital people have taken over a
big barn-like freight depot at the
Care du Nord and. converted it into
a station and a sort of first-aid place.

i TEST SHOWS TO RICE (U
BE SUCCESSFULLY GROWN HERE
MR
ASKEW, AN ENTERPRISING
FARMER, HAS GOOD CROP
ON HIS PLANTATION.
Convinced of the fact that It is
well nigh impossible to grow cotton
here in spite of the boll weevil rav
ages, local farmers are turning to
other agricultural products, and Mr.
E. Askew, who lives in the north
western section of the county near
Mayhew, has a considerable acreage-d'-voted
to upland rice, whic ho
thinks will bring a good profit.
Mr. Askew was in Columbus Mon-
()&' and had with him several ric?
p'ents, which were grown on his
plantation. These stalks were not
only well developed, but well fruited,
and citizens who ore familiar vith
Louisiana rice fields, declare that
they will compare favorably, with
plants grown in the Telican State.
Mi. Askew states that the pbwt can
te successfully grown on an land
that will produce corn, am) the cul
tivation of rice promises to b"eor-t
a jrofitable industry in thi section.

After having declined steadily
last week, the cotton market took an
upward turn Monday and appreciable
advances were made on that day and
at yesterday's session. Monday's ad

heavy selling, but the bulls were in
the saddle yesterday and the loss
was more than recuperated, the mar
ket having closed firm at an advance
of from 15 to 20 points.

BURLESON DEMANDS RETRAC
TION OF STATEMENT BY
ILLINOIS SENATOR.
Washington, Sept. 13. Postmas
ter General Burleson has published e
letter he had written to Senator
Sherman of Illinois, calling on him
to correct "vilely false impressions''
left by a statement made by the Sen;
ator in the Senate lust week.
Senator Sherman read from a Tex
as newspaper of 1909 to show that
Mr. Burleson then was part owner of
a Texas ranch on which convicts
were employed and declared that the
foreman of the ranch, after being
acquitted of the charge of causing
the death of a negro convict, was
appointed postmaster of Longview.
Mr. Burleson's letter says the fact.-:
are that he was part owner of a
plantation which the state itself
leased and operated; that the fore
man referred to was the plantation
superintendent employed by the
state, who was acquitted of a charge
believed to have been made for poli
tical purposes, and who was appoint
ed postmaster with the acquiescence
of the congressman from his district.
The Senator is referred to two
Senators from Texas for informa
tion as to the character of the post
master, now dead.

Mr. Harris was u member of one

upward, having served in variou
capacities and having," when the
death of the lamented Capt. C. A.

the nominee by a majority of 177

Before the motion to name the
nominee was put, S. L. McLaurin
trained the floor and offered a sub
stitute motion that Mr. Knox, who
was present, be permitted to make
a statement if he so desired. Thij
precipitated a debate that lasted
more than an hour.
Mr. Knox arose just befora the
vote was taken on the motion to de
clare Mr. Sykes the nominee and
culled attention to the fact that he
filed a sworn statement with the sec
retary of the committee, Joseph H.
Norwood.
Mr. Knox told newspaper men that
he thought it unfair that he was not
allowed a hearing before the com

to mean that it is probable that he
may become an independent in No
