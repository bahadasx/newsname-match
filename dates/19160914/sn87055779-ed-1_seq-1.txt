PALIS. Sept, 14. Premier Briand
today delivered before the French
chamber of deputies his anxiously
awaited speech reviewing the war
and aroused tumultuous cheers
when he predicted a complete vic
tory for thf allies and the over
throw of the central powers.
The premier declared that the
complete unity in the allies' aims
and operatiems had assured a final
Teutonic defeat and a lasting peace.
Considerable time was devoted by
the premier to a discussion of the
Balkan situation after he had de
clared that the intervention of
Loumania in the war and Italy's
declaration of war against Germany
had completed the solidarity of the
allies' action.
"After Turkey." said the premier,
"Bulgaria will realize that it is dan
gerous for a country' 4 desert her
traditional friendships in order to
subordinate herself to the selfish
schemes of an unscrupulous nation.
"The invasion of Greek Mace
donia encountered no serious resist
ance from Greece. The behavior in
this country of agents of German
corruption and espionage led the al
lies to take or Jemand measures in
dispensable to the security of their
troops.
"The Zaimis government. to
whose loyalty it is just to pay
homage, accorded us the first satis
faction we desired. We- hope the
Greek people will understand the
re.' ans and the object of our inter
vention. We were called to Saloniki
to contribute to the defense ef Ser
bia. Greece's ally. We hhall pursue
to the end the task for which she
asked our help."

NEW LONl)ON, Sept. 14. The
first problem on which the Ameri

have failed to reach quickly a com
mon grcund of understanding was
confronted today. After listening
further to the views of Gen. Task er
II! Rliss, assistant chief -f staff of
the army, regarding border' condi
tions, an effort was begun to iix re
sponsibility for the Columbus raid,
as well as the Carrizal and Parral
incidents.
The American commissioners in
sisted that the de facto government
accept rosponsibilitj- for the Colum
bus raid. The Mexican commission
ers contended that the American
commander at Columbus had id
vance information of the intended
Villa raid, arid that no blame at
tached to the Carranza government.
To this the American commissioners
responded that the raiders came
from anl returned to the territory
supposed to be tinder control of tho
b facto Mexican government and
that therefore the blame and re
sponsibil.ty should he placed there.
In regard to the Parral incident,
the commissioners were just as fat
apart. The Mexican commissioners
declared that the American troop-
in attempting to pass through the
town exceeded their orders as they
were understood by the Carranzista
authorities throughout Mexico.
