TAKE FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES FROM THE WICHITA RED SOX
This was the best series of frames the Blues have had this season. The
Red Sox took the load in the early innings of each game, but no matter
how bin the lead, the Blues would tighten and gradually pound out a vic
tory. Eabcock was unable to do much box work on account of a sprained
thumb on his pitching hand, but looked goo.l in the. other positions he filled.
Knaddlcr was the star pitcher of the series. In four days he pitched 23 in
nings, struck out 31 men, walked 4 men end kept the hits well scattered.
He put the ball over the fence the 2nd day, for a homer scoring t'.vo nheafl
of him. Lyons and Brannon led with the sticks, each netting I saiete?.
Bobby Miller, the little man stationed between second and third base played
like a leaguer, making some of the fastest plays v.o will ever have an op
portunity to see until we witness a game in the "big show." Bobby and Kerr
form a combination that would look good on any man's ball club. Mattox
played well and carried the "pep" of a "Johnny Evers." Clark and Meanor
certainly did their part in making it a "clean sweep." Meanor'never had' an
error in the four games and clouted the pill like a "sure to go up man."
"Blondy" Morton was dependable at first and pitched good ball what time
he was in the box. McFadden played in his usual good form, pulling down
oovrül that looked like hits. The box scores follow:

SOLD THE CATHOLIC

SEi-1 NE1-4, IHCI-l SE1-1 s:c
i on 11 and S2 MV1-4 section 12
to.vnshin 30 north of range 28
iast, in which is situated the
"Moo-'e and Sheridan" addition
to the town of Folsom, nnl
v. hich was deeded to a tax
speculator of Trinidad, Colora
do, sometime last July on ac
count of an illegal assessment
ar.rl tn illegal tax certificate,
namely No. 317. Although this
church property is exempt from
taxation it is not free from t! c
clot'.'1, r.n-.v cast upon the title
by this transaction. !s this an
other "great achievement" of
flhe so-ctlled democratic admin
istration that the "Resolutions
Committee" forgot to mention?
It' will be remembered that the
citizen called attention in its issue of
August 6, 1915, to an "Amendment
to Section 38, Laws of 1913, by Chap-
er 78, Section 38, Laws of 1915, re
specting the disposition of tax sales
certificates held by the county on the
first day of .April, 1915. This section
provides that the owner of any prop
erty covered by any such certificate
should have the right of redemption
mtil the first of January, 1916, by
Imply paying the amount of the tax
es oue. Notwithstanding this option
fixed by the law and which could not
be disposed of nor set aside by the
action of any official connected ..with
the administration of the tax laws,
one of these certificates of sale, name
iy, Certificate 'No. 317 for the NE1-4
8E1-4, SE1-4 NE1-4 section 11, and
Sl-2 NW1-4 of 'section 12, township
30 north of range 28 east, was sold
July 31, 1915, to one, Bernard A. Gow,
a tax speculator of Trinidad, Colora
do, for $28.5, and a tax deed issued
therefor and is now of record as a
cloud upon the title to the home of
every on who lives in what is known I in the face of the law that such help
incompetent, so-called democratic
maladministration although it i-.s
not so intended? '
This is only one out of many suih.
instances that might be mentioned. It
is somewhat mysterious tt many peo
ple just how a foreign tax speculator
should come to Union County to spec
ulate in delinquent taxes. Had he
waited until after January 1, 1910,
yoúr option under the law ivould have,
expired and you left without excuse..
It is admitted that the existence of
this provision of law was not sus
pected in Union County until the Citi
zen called attenton to its existence but
it was well known before the deed to
that property wa3 issued. Now why
all this haste in deeding away prop
erty of taxpayers in this county es
pecially when the law had given a re
spite until the first day of January
1916?
A republican legislature tried to
help the poor delinquent taxpayer out
of his troubles by making them as
light as p'ossible, but a so-called dem-
I
is the "Moore and Sheridan" addition
to the Town of Folsom. This tract of
land was laid out into town lots as an
addition to the town of Folsom before
Union County was organized. It was
illegally assessed in the year 1900, the
year for which said certificate was is
sued, as acreage property for it has
never been such since the county was
organized. Now many of these good
oeople, who are living on, and own
icrr.es in, this land, are actually sold
out of house and home by such official
iction and are now made subject to
'.!: terms of a tax speculator who can
shall not reach you. We cannot be
lieve that such action was taken pur
posely to injure you but the injury
- -.( result of such action no
matter what the motive behind may
have been. A mal-administration of
law may be unintentional, and we are
liberal-minded cnoiish to v- .- -.-c 'e that
in a great majority of e:-a:s '.here
mal-administration 0'.i;s it is unin

should nnt have taken place prior to', with an illegal !si's';nier:., sjiomlly,
January 1, 1916. The people should ! with an illegal sale cf t'-.e property
have had the benefit of the option the assessed, and thirdly, 15 y'e.rs later,
'aw created for them. Now, Mr. besmears its title rv.oi'is with the
Home-Owner, in the "Moore and same illegal procedure in its supposed
Sheridan" addition to the town of Fol- finality. There was no such taxable
som, you can pay Mr. Tax Speculator property in Union Couity at the time
