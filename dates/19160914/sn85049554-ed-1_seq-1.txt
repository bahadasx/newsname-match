piled, Col. Frank O. Lowden received
161,141 votes for the republican nom

Former Senator William Lorimer
concedes his defeat for the republican

which he had counted to give him a
lead failed to live up to his expecta

Women Fail to Vote.
Less than fourteen per cent of the
registered women voters of Chicago
balloted in the primary yesterday ac
cording to returns today. The small
vote cast by women was attributed to
the scarcity of offices for which they
might vote. 'More democratic women
than republican went to the polls.
There were approximately "22,000 dem
ocratic votes to the 16,000 for repub
lican women. The total women vote
is expected to reach about 40,000.
Colonel Frank O. Lowden won in a
landslide. He captured the republican
nomination for governor yesterday by
a clear majority estimated 65,000 to
75,000 over his two opponents. State

It was the most smashing margin of
victory ever given in a governorship
primary battle since Illinois went
under the direct primary'system. An
idea of-its size may be gained from
the fact that Deneen in 1908 had a
"plurality of 12,000 over Yates, and in
1912 when eight were in the field
Deneen won by a plurality of -64.000

With Lowden's triumph, the statb
slate backed by the Thompson-Ldw
den-Sherman forces, known as the
"Peoria slate," likewise appears to
have won almost in its entirety. There

turns have not come In, and they are
the spots on which the "slate-smash

These were high spots in yesterday's
battle for congressional nominations.
In Cook county the fight waged fierce
ly and the incomplete returns at a
late hour left several nominations in
doubt.
Beaten by A. W. Fulton.
*Lorimer's defeat in the Sixth district
was at the hands of Arthur W. Fulton,
a former alderman, who had the city
hall-neutral crowd backing as well as
the ex-progressive organization sup
port. Lorimer had been waging a
strenuous tent meeting campaign since
his political "come back" announce
ment at a meeting of depositors of the
defunct LaSaile Street Trust and Sav
ings Bank. His platform was that he
be allowed to "come back" politically
and make good.
Every force the Lundln-Thompson
city hall cohorts could muster was
thrown against Lorimer, despite the
fact that he was their former chieftain.
Probably more money was spent in the
district than in any two others in the
city. ^Lorimer's lieutenants consisted
mainly of Joseph' Bidwell and Adam
Wolf, followers of the days of his
power.
Mann Claims 12,000 Lead.
The victory of James R. Mann for

GERMANS ASSAIL GERARD.
American Ambassador Accused of Be

Berlin, Sept. 14.—The American am

press, this time for a remark attributed
to him regarding a speech mode re
cently by Dr. Gustav Stresemann, na
tional liberal member of the reichstag.
advocating among other things a re
sumption of the submarine warfare.
Ambassador Gerard is quoted as say
ing that he did not understand how the
representatives of districts for which
export to America was a vital question
could advocate ruthless submarine
warfare. The national liberal press
agency in a communication to the
newspaper tak?s the Ambassador to
task for what Is termed "unwarranted
intervention in a purely German ques
tion" and says that the ambassador's
remark is characterized by "that naive
presumptuousness which believes that
the decision affecting Germany's poli
tical future will bp dictated by Ger
many's' American export Interests."
The paper declares that Ambassador
Gerard would do better to leave to the
responsible German authorities the de
cision on what use 1s to be made of the
means at their command against Eng
land. and adds:
"The art and manner In which Am
bassador Gerard—and not for the first
tlme—looks
after British interests is
extremely characteristic of his general
attitude."
The American ambassador In reply
says that he never heard of Dr. Strese
mann's speech and certainly never
made any public utterance of the nat
ure attributed to him. His attitude
on the submarine Issue, he declares1,
is based fin pro-American, not pro
British' motives.

Liquor and Labor.
Mr. Spiiiman aald that he Would ap
point a special Investigator, an expert
of national reputation, to study condi
tions thruout the United States to de
termine whether dairymen would be
justified in a general price raise In
milk.
The investigation by the department
was ordered because of threats in New
York, New England, Pennsylvania. Illi
nois, and other dairy sections to In
crease pricte to consumers.
"The farm management division of
the department of agriculture," Mr.
Splllman said, "had planned an exten
sive investigation of the question of
milk production before the situation
arose in Washington. We want to get
at the facts as to the cost of milk pro
duction."
Mr. Spiiiman said that in various
sections of the country farmers have
gone out of the dairy business and
turned to truck farming and poultry
raising because they thought they
could not produce milk with profit.
Herman E. Gasch, a member of the
committee of Maryland and Virginia
•producers, said today that the pro
ducers want to get at the bottom of
the trouble and would like for the pub
lic to know the real situation.
"The committee." he said, "desires
to go before the public with a Justifica
tion of its proposition to increase the
price of milk. We want the public to
know that present conditions in the
milk producing business are ruinous.
We believe the public will help the
producers. If small producers are
forced to sell their stuff the butchers
will net the cows and then the milk
price to the consumer will ultimately
go up."
Mr. Oasch said that steel and muni
tion plants are drawing heavily upon
laborers formerly employed by milk
producers of Maryland and Virginia
and the price of labor has largely in
creased.

ZAIMIS' PRIDE HURT.
Retiring Grecian Premer Offsndsd
Haste of Entente Allies.
Athens, via London, Sept. 14.—Every
effort to persuade Alexander Zaimia,
the aged premier, to remain in office
wan fruitless. His pride was wounded
by the appearance of the allied fleet
oft Piraeus at the very moment when
negotiations had been begun for the
entry of Greece into the war. The ar-"
rest of Austrians and Germans in
Athens by French and British agents
and the invasion of the French lega
tion by ruffians, with the continual in
ternal discord in the face of a great
national crisis completely discouraged
the entire cabinet.
The result was not only to precipitate
the retirement of the entire Zaimia
ministry but to bring to a standstill
all discussion of a departure from
neutrality by Greece.
"I hope the entente now sees where
Its policy of trying to force matters
lead."," a prominent Greek official said
to the A. P. today. "The moral effect
of Greece's entry into the war with the
allies unquestionably would have been
a shortening of the war by many
months. Without a figure like Zalmis
to conduct the negotiations there is
scarcely a ghost of a chance that this
can be arranged. Nobody In Greece
has opposed entry into the war for th«
last fortnight and If this country does
not go in th» responsibility must fall
on those who are too Impatient.'1

also wishes to sound the ministers of
the entente before reaching a decision.
The minister Is known to have de
clared his acceptance of the premier
ship will only be made on the basis
that he will be given full power to con
trol the national policy. He will insist
that his hands must be free to tak»
whatever steps the situation may de
