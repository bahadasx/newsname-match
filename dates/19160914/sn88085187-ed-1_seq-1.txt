A double misunderstanding on
the part of both Americans and
Mexicans is causing the present
antagonism on the Mexican bor

Ledgewldge, an officer of Car
ranza's army, who addressed
Pierce county democrats at the

Americans have begun to
loathe and look down upon Mexi
cans because of the untrue and
revolting stories brought back
by disappointed promoters and
seekers of wealth in the Mexican
country.
Dlax caused his people to fear
America years ago. In order to
hold a wtilp over them, and this
fear as in all cases, developed

U. S. DEVELOPING
LINEN INDUSTRY
(The European war brought a I
shortage in the I'nlted States of [
many manufactures uhlili hither
in had been Imported. Americans
immediately set to xvork to rem
edy the lack—with striking suc
cess. This is the flrat of a series I

I Newspaper Kalerprlse Aaaoelalloa)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 14.
■—Because the noßes of American
farmers are more sensitive than
those of Russian and Irish peas
ants, the United States has had no
linen Industry.
But American commercial gen
ius, out of respect to sensitive ol
factory organs, has solved the
problem ln another way— and
THERE IS GOING TO BE an
American linen industry!
Linen Is made from flax, which
tlie botanists call an "Inner-bark"
fiber plant.
Between the outer skin on the
stem and the woody inner pith is
found the commercially useful
flax fiber.
Before this is ready for the
mill, the plants must not only be
harvested, the seed removed and
the straw dried, but a process
known as "retting," which Is a
polite way of saying, "rotting,"
must take place.
In Europe the flax farmer rets
his plants by putting bundles of
flax straw on end ln pools dug
to the correct depth, and keeping
them covered with water from
seven to 10 days.
In Ireland, where this method
Is much used, the stench from
these retting pools covers the
country for miles around.
When the process is complete,
the men must wade waist deep in
these fetid pools and lift out the
slimy mass of straw.
American farmers won't do
this kind of work.
Ho flax in the I nlted
States is raised almost whol
ly for flax-seed, or linseed
oil.
Now, however, at least two
companies in the United States
have perfected a chemical proc
ess which works. The Northern
Flay Fllier Co. of Great Falls,
Mont., Is one, and the United
States Linen Co. of Beloit, Wis.,
another.
These companies are making
contracts with farmers to grow
fiber-bearing flax at a guaranteed
Income to the farmer of $15 an
acre.
The European war has alreajy
curtailed the available supply of
flax fiber from abroad. The
United States In normal years Ini-
