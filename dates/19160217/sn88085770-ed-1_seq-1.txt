Canadian Socialists
Jailed for Sedition
Comrade John Reid, Socialist can
didate for the Alberta, Canada, legis
lature for Red Peer riding, lias been
sentenced to fifteen months in jail,
having been found guilty of sedition.
Comrade Reid is a veteran of the
Boer War. Ho fought for the British
government on behalf of Internation
al capitalists who wanted to get pos
session of the rich diamond, mines
and fertile land and markets Of South
Africa.
After fighting for "His Country,"
and then seeing the jobs turned over
to Chinese instead of Britishers, ho
revolted. Later ho became a Social
ist and a well-versed student of the
Socialist philosophy. He has been a
candidate for political office on the
Socialist party ticket many times.
During his recent tour as a candi
date he stated in his lecture that "he
was British born but not proud of It."
That "he had no country." That the
European war "was a capitalists'
war." That "the British equalled the
Germans when it came to atrocities."
He also advised the workers not to
enlist nor give to the patriotic fund.
This was the "seditious" language he
used for which he received a sentence
of fifteen months.

OPPOSES CHILD LABOR
NEW YORK.—'lsn't there some
thing wrong with our democracy —
first slavery and then the cruel labor
of 2,000,000 children?" asked Dr. Felix
Adler, in an address on "Dangers to
Children in a Democratic Environ
ment."
"There are 835,000 children between
10 and 13 years of age in gainful oc
cupations in the United States, j
There are more than 1,000,000 be
tween 14 and 15. In all, there are
a little less than 2,000,000," said the
speaker, who urged the passage of
j the Keating-Owen bill, which has
! been reported favorably by the house

debar from interstate commerce the

I of age in mines and quarries, and un

Why Is Big Business Behind
The Preparedness Campaign?
By GEORGE O. WEST
Why have leaded of the steel group
and tho Standard Oil group none out
of their way to present armored mo
tor cars to tin* Now York militia and
to throw ail their Influence back of
the demand for a huge army and navy
and an aggressive foreign policy?
Tin' answer is easy.
If big business had had Its way dur
ing the past three years, American
armies would now bo on Mexican soil,
and thousands of American boys
would have Riven their lives to pro
tect tin- Mexican investments of the
Standard Oil Co., William Randolph
Hearst, tin- Quggenhelms, Pbelps,
Dodge & Co., Harrison Gray Oils, and
I others of their kind.
Mexico is only the beginning.
Big business wauls a huge army
and navy because big business, hay-
reached the end of tin1 cheap la
bor supply in this country, having
capitalized this country's natural re
sources for about all they will stand,
and having exploited the people of
this country to the point where fur
ther putting on of the screws will
be difficult or dangerous, is now plan
ning a campaign of world conquest.
Attention already has been called
to the plans of the National City
Hank and its president, F. A. Vander
lip, for a great foreign trade corpora
tion to finance raids on the natural
resources of foreign lands. Vander
lip's $50,000,000 American Internation
al Corporation began its existence a
month ago with the enthusiastic sup
port of Standard Oil, and United
States Steel. Its staff has been're
cruited largely from those corpora
tions and their affiliated enterprises.
Its charter permits it to do every
i thing from building railroads and
docks to reorganizing foreign govern
ments.
On January 25, the new corporation
issued a statement in the name of
President Chas. A. Stone which shows
even more clearly Its imperialistic
purposes. Stone said:

BABIES WORK IN

NEW YORK.—In a report to
the Consumers' League, Mrs. F.
Nathan, president, stated that
74 per cent, of the flowers made
in the United States are made
in this city under conditions
that should force the abolition
of all tenement manufacture.
Whole families were found
working long hours under un
sanitary conditions. Babes as
young as 2 l/ 2 years were found
working. One had learned to
strip the gauze from leaves
which had been packed on it.
Four children in one family, the
oldest 10 and the youngest 4,
worked from 6 In the morning
till 8 at night, and a young girl
of 15, a semi-invalid, putting
stems on berries at 1 cent a
gross, could only make 15 cents
a day when her little sister
helped.

It is almost six months since the
British government stated that "the
matter of increased rents was being
carefully watched." Since that time
rents have been raised in all parts of
England and Scotland and the gov

The Canadian Grain Growers' As

THE TRUTH HURTS
Because it told the truth about
Youngstown and the shameful ex
ploitation of immigrant workmen by
the United States Steel Corporation,
"The Iron Trade Review," official or
gan of the steel industry, in its issue
of January 27 demands that the ad
ministration at Washington drive the
Committee on Industrial Relations
from the national capital.
In a long tirade, this organ of ex
ploiting corporations sputters and
fumes over the showing of facts con
tained in the report on the Youngs
town riot by George P. West and the
accompanying discussion of conditions
in the steel industry at large by Basil
M. Manly, director of the committee
and director of the investigation con
ducted by the United States govern
ment into conditions of labor in the
steel industry in 1910.
Liquor was the sole cause of the
Youngstown disturbance, we are told.
