'Hands up!”
Old Zeklel Grow, butler, coachman,
In fact general major domo of the
Brunelle household, gave a shiver and
a gulp. Then his long scrawny fists
went up In the air.
"Now then, blow the top of his head
off, he lets out a whimper or moves an
Inch. The mischief!”
One of two highwaymen had abrupt
ly entered the hall of the Brunelle
home that calm summer afternoon to
startle poor, faithful old Zeklel half
out of his wits. The light face mask
he wore had suddenly come loose. Old
Zeklel stared, sputtered, looked ap
palled. Then the main malefactor ran
up the stairs.
He evidently had studied the lay of
the ground previous to this actual mo
ment of the raid. Instantly he chose
the most pretentious and boudoirlike
of the sleeping apartments. A score
of pretty tokens of feminine vanity
and daintiness upon the bureau guided
the intruder.
The latter pulled open the drawers
with true professional rapidity. He
tossed over their contents swiftly. At
last his hands closed about a richly
Inlaid box. It was locked, but he drew
a chisel from his pocket and roughly
pried off the cover.
"It’s a rich haul, Just as I knew It
would be,” he chuc3 e< ) gleefully
"now for a get-away!"
The marauder transferred the glit
tering baubles in tne box to his pock-
Handa Up!"
cts, tossed their former receptacle Into
a corner of the room and descended
the stairs In three bounds. Old Zeklel
stood as he had left him —rigid, erect,
looking Into the barrel of the gleam
ing weapon presented by thief No. 2.
"Gentlemen —" began Zeklel. mildly
and beseechingly.
"Stow that!” growled tho man who
had led In the foray. Then he whipped
out a revolver from his hip pocket,
dealt Zeklel a sharp blow on the head
with Its butt and the old man sank
to the floor dazed, half stunned and as
If In a trance saw the two robbers
mount their horses outside and swiftly
disappear.
One hour later Judge Brunelle and
hla daughter drove up to their homo
to find old Zeklel In a frantic state of
agitation The Judge looked serious,
and pretty lone sat down and cried
as If her heart would break, when aho ,
ascertained that the heartless de
epcllers had made off with all her Jew
elry and keepsakes.
"It was Black Donald,” asserted
Zeklel. "Judge, I saw him —1 know
him.”
“Nonsense!” dissented the Judge.
"Black Donald went to New Mexico
two years ago.”
"Then he’s come back again,” de
clared Zeklel. "I’d swear to him,
Judge.”
The Judge forthwith consulted the
police. Two years previously, back In
their mountain fastnesses, the des
perate, unruly gang beaded by the no
torious Black Donald, modern outlaws
and daring lawbreakers of the district,
had been broken up and driven out.
Since then, except for occasional
thefts from farmers and forcible as
sault upon stray intruders upon
their “domain,” the remnants of the
gang had made little trouble In the
section.
Instantly the local officers were on
the trail. Within an hour after the
Judge had returned home to console
his daughter three visitors appeared.
They were young men, friends of lone.
They wanted tn become lovers. They
were the favored trio of the numer
ous contingent of which pretty lone
Brunelle was the center and queen.
There was Walt Afton, tall, distin
guished, indolent of movement and
speech. He was a scion of a wealthy
family, as was his companion Burt
Willis The latter was studying medi
cine with the veteran doctor of the
district, but was alow and neglectful
of bis educational opportunities. And
there was Ned Powers Just blooming
Into the full fame of the law—sturdy,
i but with force and character in his
open, handsome lace. Walt was the
' apekesman
THURMONT, FREDERICK COUNTY, MD., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1916.
“We heard about the robbery,” he
announced, in his leisurely, drawling
way. “We came to sympathize with
Miss Brunelle, to offer our services.”
“Thanks," bowed the Judge, "but tho
police are on the scent and we have
a sure clue as to the identity of the
thief.”
“Indeed?” commented young Willis.
“Yes—it was Black Donald.”
Walt fidgeted. Burt looked over his
shoulder as If afraid of something.
Ned Powers spoke up promptly.
“I know Black Donald,” he said
quickly. "If you are certain of that.
Judge, 1 tlrnk 1 could penetrate his
haunts.”
“lone is too distressed to see you,
young gentlemen,” said the Judge.
“She cares very slightly for the loss
of her diamonds, for they can be re
placed. There was, however, a coral
necklace her dead mother gave her
years ago when she was a child. In
trinsically it is worthless, but I would
give a small fortune to recover it."
”1 shall send.for a city detective at
once,” announced Walt —"a corps of
them, If necessary. That necklace
shall be recovered!”
”1 know relatives of some of tho
old gang,” observed Burt. “I’ll see If
they won't help me recover it.”
Ned Bowers said nothing, but there
was a set expression of resolve In his
face as he left the place, and Walt
observed laughingly:
“We are all in the race, fellows, 1
fancy the one who recovers that sto
len necklace will stand In high favor
with Miss Brunelle.’
So at least Ned Powers thought and
believed, and he went on his way. tak
ing no counsel and detailing naught
of his plans to his chattering compan
ions.
Walt made a call at the Brunelle
home two evenings later. He made a
great play before lone of his vast ef
forts to have Black Donald apprehend
ed and tho stolen necklace recovered.
Then came Burt. A relative of one
of tho mountain families was under
obligations to him and he had gone
to see If he could not secretly ferret
out the thieves and the booty.
But lone though* little of their In
terest in her behalf. One of her cava
liers was simply spending his money,
with plenty to spend. Neither under
took any personal risk.
Then both valorous champions came
up against disappointment and cha
grin. The detectives learned that
Black Donald after tho raid had stayed
only two days with his friends and had
gone back to New Mexico presum
ably with his plunder
The emissary of Burt simply aroused
suspicion for his investigations and
learned nothing of Importance
“Father, what has become of Mr.
Powers?” one day lone Inquired and
there was a conscious blush on her
pretty face which the judge did not
fall to notice.
Ned Powers answered the inquiry In
person two days later. Bronzed, tat
ered, weather-worn, he came into the
.own. His first call was at the Bru
nelle home. Its object was to place
in tho hands of its lovely young mis
tress the cherished coral necklace.
lone went extravagantly wild over
It. Her eyes sparkled with gratitude
and admiration for the one man who
had risked his life to restore to her a
precious memento.
”1 recovered It from a sister ot Black
Donald," explained Ned. "The rest of
the plunder her brother took away
with him.”
A month later tho engagement of
lone and Ned was announced. One
afternoon the happy pair were seated
in a hammock, conversing.
“You are sure you never cared for
anyone but mo?" Inquired lone.
"Never!" was the stanch, truthful
reply.
“Nor —nor ever flirted with au’
other girl!” persisted lone.
“Once."
Her fair brow shadowed
"Yes," admitted Ned, with a quizzi
cal smile —"it was by paying strong
court to the sister of Black Donald
that 1 got hold of the coral necklace.’
"Oh, that doesn’t count!" cried lone
effusively—"that was simply the strat
egy of war!” and she rewarded him
with a kiss of perfect confidence and
love.
WHY MOTHER SINGS TO BABY
Primeval Call of Feminine Nature,
According to Scientists Who Have
Studied the Subject.
Psychologists who have carefully
studied the characteristics of Instinct
In woman have discovered Jusc why
mothers sing their babies to sleep. It
Is not merely Inspired by the expec
tation of better sleep in their children,
but it Is the primeval call ot tho femi
nine nature. It is a maternal prompt
ing which occurs naturally to each
mother.
Savage mothers who are never
known to sing upon other occasions
Invariably hum and croon to their
children at night, and upon one other
instance —when they are planting seed.
It is a peculiarity of the Zuni native
women and one which has oecn but
recently understood.
The theory of primitive people is
that there is some mysterious connec
tion between the sound ot a woman’s
voice and growing things.

Posilipo, in the “Fairest Land of Eu
rope,” Has a History Which Makes
It of Entrancing Interest to
the Tourist.
The city of Naples gives no idea
of the beauty of southern Italy. It sits
like a ragged vagrant by the roadside
In the fairest land of Europe.
If you would see all 01 this beauty
at a glance, visit the steep headline of
I’osilipo, which juts into the sea be
yond the city. Here are combined tho
beauties of the modern Campania—
the smooth roads winding upward past
white villas, tho blue sky, under which
tho earth seems to glow, wh.le tho sea
is tipped with silver —and tho most
striking relics of the lone gone days
of the Homan en..,..u a..a the middle
ages, those periods so full of story and
color, which have moved acrora Italy,
environed in her beautiful landscape
and inspired by the romantic tempera
ment of her proi' nut) the acts of
some mighty png . at.
At I’osilipo stood the villa of Vir
gil, greatest of t.. ■ i.alin poets, and
here today is a vault where his re
mains are said to uc. It was at i’o
silipo that Virgil wrote the Georgies,
those beautful Latin pastorals that
picture all tho sea,.o.is 01 the year as
the poet studied them from his coun
try seat. Here after he hud died came
many another poet and sage to put
flowers on his tomb.
This famous sepulcher is a low
stone vault with three windows. There
formerly stood within it a tall urn,
which was said to contain tho ashes of
tho poet but this lias disappeared and
is said to have been removed by King
Robert the Wise to his palace for safe
keeping.
At tho very end of tho headland
stands one of ttic most impressive
relics of Roman luxury in all Italy. It
la the ruin of Pausilypum, the villa
built by Vedius Pollio and bequeathed
by him to Augustus Caesar. "Tho End
of Sorrow” is the meaning of its name,
which lias become that of the entire
headland.
Hero are remains of massive white
marble walls and pillars and founda

and from these and from ;!io numerous
legends and stories that cling about
them, one may reconstruct the beauty
and splendor and license of tho life ol
decadent Rome. Ho may picture the
great villa, sitting on tho point of the
headland, backed by dark groves, with
its white feet in the breaking sea. Ho
may reconstruct in fancy the Odoon
ami the theater, where tho lord and
his guests were entertained; the iish

His Ferocious Pacifism.
“I have before me," said Professor
Pate, "tho statement of the antipro
paredness literary bureau that Thomas
Carlyle was a pacifist. Indeed, ha
was! At one time a worshiping Amer
ican ventured to call on him. Tho
genius had filled up on 17 cues t
and was sitting humped ove ‘ r
the fireplace, wrapped , n a Bhawl and
an 8-iucb gro“ clli and paid no atten .

uttered a timid 'Ah bin!’
“•Silence, you blockhead!’ thun
dered Carlyle.
“Bub-hut,’ stammered the intruder,

"‘No, but you aro interrupting my

“That is the sort of paeifis Thomas
Carlyle was.”—-Kansas City Star.
Ringing in the Ears.
Swelling and congestion of the mu
cous membrane of the eustachian
tube —generally the result of neglected
catarrhal “colds" —often produces ring

it will bring on a disease of the in

Bralslin of Brooklyn told the Ameri
can Otologlcal society recently that he
treats this by swabbing out the eu
stachian tube with a solution of 20
grains of nitrate of silver in an ounce
of water, applying it on a pledget of

Don’t Tell Your Secret In Any Pub
lic Place, for a Very Good and
Sufficient Reason.
“Don’t tell your secrets on the street
car or in the theater between acta or
in any other public place, not oven to
your most trusted friend." said the
man.
“1 never do tell my secrets in pub
lic,’ she returned. "Hut why this ad
vice?" asked the woman opposite.
"Because somebody is likely to see
them.”
"See them?’’
“Yes. Don’t you remember a news
paper story a few months ago to the
effect that deaf-mutes who attend mov
ing picture shows complained that the
people on the screen did not follow
the text of the play, but used coarse,
vulgar ami often indecent and pro
fane language? These deaf-mutes
had learned lip language and knew
what those photographed players were
saying.
“Well, since then, I hear the film
companies have shut down on the bad
language, but the story caught the at
tention of a good many readers and
habitual movie patrons have fallen in
to tho way of watching the lip move
ments and some of them have devel
oped astonishing skill in reading what
is said by the silent actors. Of course,
they can read the lips of real people
just as well, hence my warning."
“Oh, I can't believe there are many
such persons."
"Don’t take any chances. You’d
probably bo surprised to know how
many people not deaf-mutes have that
little accomplishment more or less
developed. It seems with some to be
a natural gift. I heard a woman tell
tho other day of a conversation she
’saw' between two friends sitting at
the other end of a street car. Now Just
suppose those friends had been indulg
ing in uncomplimentary remarks about
her!”

part of California, with San Diego as
the center. The state has enacted pro

there is no protection, and vast
amounts of them are caught (iff the
rocky coast. They are shipped to nu
merous points on the coast farther
north. Many persons call them "lob

their cousins, both in taste and appear

"Well, nephew, here's your famous
invention," announced old Peter
Granby.
"Turned down?" questioned his fa
vorite relative, Ned Dawson.
"Hard and quick. 1 had influence
enough on account of business deal
ings to secure all due attention and
preference from liaskill & Co., cane
and umbrella manufacturers.’’
"And what did they say?"
"Impracticable. They claim that
customers will not pay an advanced
price. Anyway, they stick to the
cheap, simple, old-fashioned umbrella."
Ned Dawson looked disappointed,
but shrugged ills shoulders resignedly.
“Well, Uncle Peter," he observed
wearily, “I'll try something better next
time."
“There must bo no next time!" thun
dered the old man in sudden decision,
and boisterous, too. "That's why I
sent for you—to give you back your
discredited invention and inform you
that you've gut to quit these vain side
Issues, now and for all time. If you
don’t, I’ll —l'll, yes, I’ll disown you. ’
Ned smiled. Ho never flinched, for
ho loved the dear old man and knew
that he loved him in return.
"You see, Ned," pursued Uncle Pe
ter more tolerantly, “I’ve gone to a
lot of trouble to get your started in

Invent. 1 make it no secret that I
intend to care for your future hand
somely. If I marry," and the old
man hero flushed up like an awkward
schoolgirl, “I shall at once settle on
your competence. If 1 die without
marrying, why, of course, you will bo
sole heir to all I possess."
"See here, uncle," said New spicily,
"I don’t care a farthing for your
money. You've been a regular father
to me already and I want to simply
continue to have your good will. I'll
cut out my dreaming and make my
self a business man you will be proud
of. Only, uncle, ns a compliment to
mo, please accept my first —and last
—invention as a gift."
And Ned presented the returned um
brella to hla relative with a mock he
roic air.
"It does what I say It does," he
went on —"opens at the touch of a
button, closes through a similar proc
ess, It "holds tight and neat. It's big
and roomy, It really keeps the rain
off.”
"Thank yoiu Ned," bowed Uncle Pe
ter gravely.
"About marrying,’ proceeded Ned,
"don’t think mo too familiar or pre
sumptuous, but I wish you would."
“Huh!” uttered the old man eagerly.
' Yes, I do," assented Ned vehe
mently. "Oh! I know your choice —
Miss Edith Warner. Well, where will
you find a better match? She is thirty,
ana handsome, intelligent, industrious,
and I really think she likes you."
“Don’t —don’t raise any false hopes,
boy," pleaded Uncle Peter faltoringly.
"I’m not. Have you ever indicated
your feelings for her?”
“Ned," answered his uncle desper
ately, “whenever I have got ready to
say something, she fixes those wunder
ful eyes attentively on me, and I got
all flustered. If I could only blindfold
her, or catch her In the dark for five
minutes I could speak out my mind
and get It all over with. ’
‘ Oh, pshaw, you dear, modest old
fellow," railed Ned affectionately—

fused."
"Ned, do you really think so? Why,
tf Miss Warner should accept me, I’d
be the happiest man in the world!”
“Then prepare for that rare good
fortune," predicted Ned. "Forty, good
looking, rich, the most genial and con
siderate of men—why, you could
marry a princess, if you wanted to!”

age, and finally went to the telephone.
It was to call up Miss Warner —
would she be at home that evening?
Would she honor him by allowing a
friendly call? A silvery tone at the
other end of the wire responded af
firmatively to both inquiries.
Dismally, however, Uncle Peter
looked out of the window of his su
perb bachelor quarters, as eight
o’clock arrived, it had begun to driz
zle outside. Now Uncle Peter was
a pink of perfection as to neatness
and dress. He abhorred a crease or
wrinkle in his immaculate attire, and
damp clothes —horrors!
"Ah, Ned's umbrella!” suddenly Ju
bilated the old fellow. “It’s water
proof, ’ he said, “it's big and broad.
Yes, i'll go."
Glad was he that he did. He met
a warm welcome. Never had Miss
Warner seemed so charming, so en
couraging The bright lamplight, the
cheery grate fire, the luxurious best
easy chair he fitted, the exquisite cup
of tea her own fair hands brewed —
ah! this was worth living for, true,
homelike happiness.
Twice Uncle Peter "Ha-humcd!” The
speech of speeches upon his lips, ho
faltered. Those radiant eyes abashed
him. He fancied he detected a whim
sical smile on those charming lips,
and, too, a pleased glow in the mag
netic eyes, but ho only blushed, embar
rassed, and with a sigh arose at
length to say good night.
"It is still raining, 1 fear,” spoke
Mias Warner, as they stood in the
hall.
*T have brought an umbrella,’ ex
plained Uncle Peter. "And, oh! by the
way,” and, glad of an excuse to re
main by the side of his lady love as
long as possible, ho took it from the
rack to begin to explain that It was
Ned's own invention, and how it op
erated.
"Oh, dear! see what 1 have done!’'
she cried in dismay, as, after it was
opened, and slier, standing dangerously
near to Uncle Peter, chanced to touch
the button.
For at once the ribbed folds of the
umbrella embraced them, squeezed
them in a close prison, and there, in
a truly ludicrous position, they stood.
“I— -1 can’t reach the button," began
Uncle Peter.
"How awkward!” murmured Miss
Warner, but she did not make any
great effort at release, and then Uncle
Peter grasped the grand opportunity
of his life.
“Miss Warner,” he uttered rapidly,
“one moment, please. I can break the
umbrella and free ourselves, hut, here,
in the dark, that is. with your eyes not
upon me, 1 mean-dear eyes—my
dearest—l mean to say—l love you!”
There! It was out. Her head was
near his shoulder. Creak! he expand
ed his aims and thrust the battered
umbrella aside, a wreck. He directed
a swift glance to her face. Its ex
pression was telltale.
“Is it possible that a blundering old
idiot like myself might hope he has
not offended you?” he blurted out.
"Don’t you dare to abuse my dearest
friend, sir,” she rallied, and extended
both hands, and Uncle Peter nearly
hurrahed amid his great Joy!
“The finest invention ever made,
Ned, ray boy!” he declared to bis
nephew the next day. "I want to buy
your patent. Why. it’s a regular love
umbrella, and there, Ned,” and ho
pressed a slip of paper into the hand
of his nephew, “is a chock for tea
thousand dollars. See Bella, get mar
ried, and be happy—just like me!”
WHEN YEARS BEGIN TO FLY
With Advancing Years, Time Has a
Disconcerting Manner of Slipping
Av.ay With Rapidity.
One of Iho most puzzling phenome
na in all lii’e is the peculiar difference
in the com option of the flight of time
existing b tween tho child and tho
aged person. A year seems an age to
a child, but to a grown person only a
few days. If both young and old were
to estimate the length of time con
sumed by an hour they would inva
riably coincide in their decision; like
wise in describing a minute or a sec
ond, but when the year is thought of
a tremendous difference is noted.
William .James, the great psycholo
gist, explained this strange freak of
our mentality when he analyzed it
thus; “Tho same space of time seems
shorter as ve grow older —that is, the
months and the years do so; whether
the hours do so is extremely doubtful,
and the minutes and seconds, to all
appearances, remain about the same.
“In youth we may have an absolute
ly new experience, subjective or objec
tive, every hour of the day. Apprehen
sion is vivid, retentiveness strong, and
our recollections of that time, like
those spent in rapid and interesting
travel, are of something intricate, mul
titudinous and long drawn out.
“But as each passing year converts
some of these experiences into auto
matic routine, which we hardly note
at ail the days and the weeks smooth
themselves out In recollection to con
tentless units and the years grow hol
low and collapse.”
No Need.
“I approve of this military training
for boys because it teaches them to
obey promptly without asking ques
tions.”
"Ah, they’ll get that training any
how. Won’t most of them marry?”
On the Job.
"How does your furnace act these
cold days? Does it keep the house
warm?"
“It keeps me warm shoveling coal,
into it”
