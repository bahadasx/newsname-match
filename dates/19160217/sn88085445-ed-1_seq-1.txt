Instinct of Self Preservation Has Been
Aroused In Nations
By DARWIN P. KINGSLEY. Life Insurance President and Financier
THE year 1910 could be made the first year in an epoch so important
that it would change the calendar. Will that be its history? Prob
ably not. Civilization can go no further under the leadership of
the doctrine of unconditioned sovereignty. So much is certain.
THE INSTINCT OF BELF PRESERVATION. WHICH IS JUST A 8
STRONG IN NATIONS AS IT 13 IN MAN AND ANIMALS AND JUST A 8
NATURAL AND NECESBARY, HAS BEEN AROUSED. THAT IS WHY
THE WORLD IS FIGHTING. FIGHTING IT OUT WILL SETTLE NOTHING
UNLESB THIS DOCTRINE IS ABANDONED. THERE IS ROOM ENOUGH
IN THE WORLD FOR ALL NATIONS, BUT UNDER THE COMPULSION
OF UNCONDITIONED SOVEREIGNTY THE GREAT POWERS OF THE
EARTH WOULD BE CROWDED IF PLACED ON THE PLANET JUPITER.
Not True Trade Follows Flag, but Flag
Follows Investments

THE Monroe doctrine simply means that there should not be set up in
the Americas any more special spheres of influence, that they
should develop on their own lines, lot them be good or bad.
WE TOOK A BTAND THAT THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD HAD A
RIOHT TO THEIR OWN SOUL BESIDES THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN BUCH
PEACE AS THEY THEMSELVES COULD ESTABLISH WITHIN THEIR
OWN BORDERS. LET US PUT FORWARD, THEREFORE, FOR ADOP
TION BY THE WHOLE WORLD THE MONROE DOCTRINE AS THE DOC
TRINE OF JUSTICE FOR ALL—VIZ, THAT THERE BHOULD NOWHERE
EXIST ANY SPECIAL SPHERES OF INFLUENCE.
Imperialism has had its worst and most injurious development in re
cent years, its essence being land grabbing and the establishing of these
spheres. Imperialism from a national standpoint does not pay; regarded
as a means of assuring unearned incomes to governing classes it emphat
ically docs.
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT TRADE FOLLOWS THE FLAG, BUT IT IS
TRUE THAT THE FLAG FOLLOWS INVESTMENTS. NAVIES AND
ARMIES ARE INSURANCE FOR CAPITAL OWNED ABROAD BY THE
LEISURE CLASS OF A NATION. IT 18 FOR THEM THAT EMPIREB AND
SPHERES OF INFLUENCE EXIST. THE GREAT WAR NOW WAGING
IS A CULMINATON OF EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND EXTEND THEBE
SPHERES.

THE FOOTPATH.

That marks tbe old remember

Tue gap that struck our school

The crooked path across tbe

It left the road by school and

A penciled shadow, nothing

That parted from tbe silver

And ended nt tbe farmhouse

Kd line or compass traced Its

With frequent bends to left or

In aimless, wayward curves It

But always kept the door in

Not long ago a congressman sent te a
constituent some horticultural seeds
ranging In variety from flowers to veg
etables. At their first subsequent meet
ing the recipient remarked: "I had a
narrow escape with those pesky seeds.
It was my fault, but I could not resist
a chance to play a practical Joke on a
friend, a very attractive widow. I
changed the envelopes containing the
flower seeds and put In the flower en
velopes lettuce, radishes and onloa
seeds, telling her that they were fur
nished by the agricultural department
and were strictly Al. I impressed, her
with the efforts of the government to
supply the best and of tbe vast sums
expended for that purpose until sh*
was persuaded to give them special at
tention. I was then called away from
town and did not see her for six weeks.
Returning, I called on tbe lady and
casually inquired about tbe seeds.
"She answered, 'To tell you the truth,
I haven't been out to tbe cemetery
since they were planted. You said
tbey were so One that I concluded to
plant them on my husband's grave.'
"I made a quick getaway and mean
dered to tbe cemetery, where I found a
fresb crop of onions, lettuce and rad
ishes growing upon tbe grave. I pulled
them up, and you bet I've sworn off
Joking widows ,wlth substitute flower
