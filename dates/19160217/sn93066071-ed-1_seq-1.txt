National Pay-Up Week
FEBRUARY 21ST TO 26TII INCLUSIVE.
In recent years many special days
have sprung up which are being
Nationally observed such a s "(.lond
Roads Day", "Kleotrleal Week", etc
Recently another speelal week luis
been added "National Pay-Up Week"
to our mind, the best of all for the
success of all others deppnds for the
liiiist purl in the doing nf the veiy
thing which National Pay-Up Week Is
designed to bring about. Thu week of
February 21st to 2t3th inclusive, will
be "Pay-Up Week" alloverthecountry
At some time during that week every
loyal citizen Is expected to walk In to
hlscredltursand square up his accounts.
The good citizen will do this if he is at
all able to meet his obligations. Kven
if he is not able to pay In full, lie
should at least pay what he can and
demonstrate his desire to pay the
whole account as soon as possible.
The person who falls or refuses to
square up because he doesn't care, is
not worthy of further credit and
should not receive it.
Business people are not allowed by
theircreditorsto wait "Pay-Up- Week."
Their accounts must b e met every
thirty or sixty days or their credit Is
shut oil. Wholesale dealers and job
bers do not carry the merchant along
on their books indefinitely. Such
be'ng the case, why should the home
merchant be expected t o carry his
customers indellnltely? They can't do
it and keep out of bankruptcy Since
this i true, why not let all of us
take an interest in making ''Pay-Up
Week" a humnipr in Beavr? Nothing
strengthens credit better than prompt
"pay Die tit of accounts. If creditors
would lie more anxious to pay what
they owf, it would not be so hard for
tho-e in need of credit to get it.
Think tliis matter over seriously and
let those who can, arrange to walk in
like a man and i-qoare up their little
accounts between the L'lst and -Oth
anyway. We are making this appeal
jn, the interest of all the business con
cerns nf Beaver. Let's square up
wjth all and see how it strengthens
our credit and puts a smile an the face
of everybody. Remember National
Pay-Up Week February L'tst to "JO h
Inclusive,
Ladies!
Get Busy!
On tha.t Spring Sewing!
Don't leave it until the hot days are here,
The "kiddies" will need plenty of dresses
aprons, rompers and sun-bonnpts and the
"old man'' may need a shirt.
Of course
YOU do not need anything, but if you
should F. C TRACY has just received his
