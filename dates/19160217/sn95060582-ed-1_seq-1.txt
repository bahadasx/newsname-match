SO YOU MAY
KNOW
D. B. Baca, Merchant, of Springerville,
bitterly attacks the Observer and says they
should publish the truth to save the editor
from damages or change the word Obse ver
to avoid the Observer from being illogical
on account of false publication.
Springerville, Ariz.. Feb. 16, 1916
Editor St. Johns Herald,
St. Johns, Arizona.
Dear Sir In an article publish
ed last Saturday, February 12,
1916, in the front page of a well
known paper of St. Johns, Apa
che County, Arizona, the follow
ing statement which in part ap
peared and reads: "D. B. Baca,
the Springerville merchant who
was convicted in -the county court
of selling intoxicating liquors in
defiance of the laws of the land,
has carried the case up to the su
preme court, etc." The publica
tion in reference is called "The
Observer" although I am at a
complete loss to properly under
stand their "observations" in the
editing field relative to the truth
of the above mentioned article
and statement as published by
"The Observer" without observ
ing to publish the truth. They
publish a blemish and false state
ment. If you please, Mr. Editor
of the "The Observer" either do
away with the word "Observer"
or write the truth about me in
your next issue to save yourself
from1 damages and avoid "The
Oberver" from being illogical.
You certainly did not publish the
truth in that instance. I have
never sold a drop of intoxicating
liquor in my life. I will also add
for the special information and
further "observations" of "The
Observer" that I never have been
convicted by any decent court of
record in any country Arizona
included of ever selling a drop
of intoxicating liquors. Your in
formation to the public is incor
rect and without foundation and
tends, I imagine, to some of the
loose dope that has been circulat
ing in this county by a small
bunch of narrow-minded, impro
gressive, injudicious and undesir
able citizens that lack the human
power and nerve to stand up for
themselves like men but sneak
behind to use their only defence
and only tools in life the tongue.
Full of envy and falsehood. Try
ing to down a man that is pro
gressive and making an honest liv
ing, holding no one's office and
making his way at his own sacred
expense. That is, my dear sir,
the only kind of citizen I care to
be and if my attitude is alterated
in the future will never change
my policy of being liberal in
every way possible": "Live and
let live" sounds very sensible to
me. Now, for the love of decen
cy never more impute me of be
ing convicted for something that
I do not know anything about or
any body else does, that is near
ly asbad as incarcerating a human
being in jail without cause or
trial of any kind on what
grounds on general principles or
j the "honorable" gall and the per
j sonal use of the good office like
some cheap office holders do, of
! course that only takes place in an
uncivilized country and when
1 their popularity is exhausted
(which is very quick) then what?
"down and out" for ever and they
have to take as compensation good
hard steady fatigue as value re
ceived. I am having the above letter
published so some of the good
people of Apache County, Arizo
na will sit up and take notice and
learn a few facts of the many un
true things that have been said
about me in this county and to
warn street talkers to hold their
tongues and find out for sure
what they are going to comment
on before they choose the risk.
Thanking you greatly for the
publication, I am, yours truly,
D. B. BACA.

The Best Recommendation.
The strongest recommendation
any article may receive is a favor
able word from the user. It is
the recommendations of those
who have used it that makes
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy so
popular. Mrs. Amanda Gierhart,
Waynesfield, Ohio, writes,
"Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
has been used in my f amily off and
on -for twenty years and it has
never failed to cure a cough or
cold." Obtainable everywhere.
The opening game of the base
ball season was played at the
park Monday, between the east
and westside teams, and taking
in consideration it being their
first game this year, it was well
played by both sides, and very
few mistakes were made. The
westside team were in the lead
from the first and ended with
the score 11 to 23 in their favor.
The weather being ideal, a large
crowd was out see the fun. An
other game will be, played next
Saturday.
For a Billious Attack,
When you have a severe head
ache, accompanied by a coated
tongue, loathing of food, consti
pation, torpid liver vomiting of
partly digested food and then bile,
you may know that you have a
severe billious attack. While you
may be quite sick tbere is much
consolation in knowing that relief
may be had by taking three of
Chamberlain's Tablets. They are
prompt and effectual. Obtain
able everywhere.
We have a large stock of arsen
ate of lead for spraying purposes.

puty Sheriff E. W. Grimes.
Minutes of the previous session
were read and approved as read.
Warren M. Tenney appeared
before the Board in the matter
of the appointment of a road
overseer, to take charge of the
work of connecting up with the
highway from Greenlee county;
and asked that -a Harper be ap
pointed to take charge of this
work. Mr. Harper apparently
being the choice of the majority
of the residents of Alpine, he
was appointed by the Board to
look after this work. Claims to
the amount of $100. 00 will be paid
by the Board upon demands being
made against the county for this

fore the Board in the matter of
the order made by the Board at
their January meeting ordering

Bond No. 6 of the $25,000.00 is
sue; Mr. Nelson stated that the
Bonds were redeemable at the op
tion of the county any time after
1918 but that up unto that thne
could not be redeemed without
the holders of the bonds were
willing. He stated that the Bank
was willing to have the county
redeem as many of the bonds as
the Board desired providing the
county would pay three months
interest in advance. This pro
position was accepted by the
Board and is considered an agree
ment between parties, as to the
privelige of redeeming bonds in
the future, up until the year 1918.
Several parties from NutrieEi)
appeared before the Board in the
matter of the assessment of the
farming land in Nutrioso for the

they were not notified of the val
uation placed upon their lands by
the Assessor and hence did not
have the opportunity to appear
before the Board -and protest to

would do at the next meeting.
