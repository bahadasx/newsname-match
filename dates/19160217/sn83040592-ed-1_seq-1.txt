Galena Not Fair.
The town of Galena, acting
through its commercial club, is
trying to get the county high
school away from Columbus, tak
ing advantage of circumstances.
Such an attempt is unfair, and
not worthy of serious considera
tion. To take advantage of mis
ortune is cowardly.
The News consistently opposed
the building of the county high
school in the first place, unless it
could be built at Baxter, where a
fine building and grounds were
offered as a nucleus. And if a
proposition to vote more bonds
should come up we would no
doubt oppose it, but Columbus is
rettinp into the collar and will
raise whatever money is needed,
above the insurance, to buna a
better building than the one
which burned.
Galena will not be permitted
to take advantage of any misfor
tune to build up her own shat
tered fortunes
Drag the Roads.
The News wishes to right now
impress upon road overseers and

roads the ruts and boles win oe
