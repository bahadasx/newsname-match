HAROLD LUXBECIv PASSES OVER.
Former High School Student nnd
Athlete Passes Away at Ames
Victim of Appendicitis.
After a heroic but unequal strug
gle Harold Lunbeck passed away at
2 o'clock this morning at the hospital
at Ames. With the vigor and aspir
ations of youtn upon the solid foun
dation of true character, there was
every promise of a rich and useful
future for tnis young man .of nine
teen years and hid going not only
severs the earthly ties of companion
ship, which was so inspiring and so
comforting, but robs the young men's
world of influence of a very useful
factor. When in the limitations of
finite judgment one is confronted
with the thought of how many could
be spared better man he, the only re
course to consolation is that the in
finite mind knows best and the good
Father—when we see the end—al
ways doeth best.
Harold Lunbeck lived most of his
short span of 19 years with his aunt,
Miss Cora Lunbeck, in Mason City.
He was a bright, industrious, consci
entious lad, and advanced in his
school work rapidly. In high school
he soon gained leadership because of
his scholarship, the good red blood
of real boyhood in his veins, his
abundant good nature and thought
fulness and consideration of his as
sociates his staunch loyalty to his
teacuers and friends, and the physi
cal vigor that stimulates courage. He
was prominent in athletics, but. with
him everytaing must be fair. He was
willing to hit hard but scorning any
resort to a foul. The leadership he
attained -in high school, he seemed
to be acquiring at Ames, where he
had become prominent in the fresh
men class, and where he was carry
ing his studies well.
During his last visit to Mason City
he gave his old high school squad
some advice before they went into
the big game of the year, which they
won, and while some of it was tech
nical, the tone of it all was to use
every ounce of strength and resource
fulness till the last second of the
game, but play fair and-win on real
merit.
In a little visit with the writer he
spoke of what he thought was the
best part of college life at Ames and
that was the building of character
and the preparation it gave a young
man for usefulness to himself and
service to others. He was regarded
with affection by his schoolmates and
dearly beloved by his aunts Miss
Lunbeck and Mrs. Robinson, who had
seen him grow from almost infancy
into rich and promising young man
hood, and they Will hate the utmost
sympathy of their large) circle of ac
quaintances and friendB here.
The deceased, with his aunt, spent
last summer with Judge anu Mrs.
Robinson at their Spirit Lake home,
and then he entered the college at
Ames, where he was accomplishing
such favorable results. Two weeks
ago, he was taken to he hospital for
an operation for appendicitis, and
complications which followed so
charged his system with the poison
incident in some cases, that he could
not survive. The remains will arrive
this evening on the Rock Island, and
the funeral services will be held at
the christian Science church tomor
row afternoon at 3:30 p. m. From
1 to 3 p. m. the body wih be at the
church where friends may view it for
the last time, prior to the service and
burial at Elmwood.
The friends of the late Harold
Lunbeck tendered their. last loving
respects to their friend and school
mate by attending in large numuers
the funeral services at the Christian
Science churcn this afternoon at 3
o'clock, conducted by M. R. Tournier,
First Reader, and Mrs. C. W. Damon,
Second Reader. Mrs. Lee Long sang
beautifully, "In The, Oh Spirit,
True and Tender" and "Oh Gentle
Presence." The pall bearers were A.
J. Steiner and C. Knoblock, members
of the Pi Cappa Alpha fraternity of
Ames, to which tne deceased belong
ed, and Donald McAuley, John Mc
Connell, Carus Blaise and Jim Con
roy, members of the high school. The
two former gentleihen accompanied
the funeral party last night from
Ames. Relatives from out of the city
who attended the funeral were Judge
and Mrs. Robinson of Des Moines,
Miss Cora Lunbeck, of Leon, MisB
Ethel Wharton of Des Moines, Mrs.
C. M. Ketcham, sister of MIbs Lun
beck, and Mrs. J. W. Rowell, a neice
of Leon, and. Miss Sanborn of Ft.
Dodge. The floral tributes were very
beautiful, responsive of the respect
and affection of the many friends of
the deceased. Interment was at Elm
wood.—Mason City Globe-Gazette.

FRANCHISE IS CARRIED
New Twenty-five Year franchise to
Leon Electric Company Voted
at the Special Election.
There was not much of a contro
versy at the spceial election held last
Friday to vote on the question of
granting a new twenty-five year
franchise to the Leon Electric Co.,
which will replace the old franchise
which had about thirteen years yet
to run, the vote being 217 in favor
of granting the franchise and only
25 votes were cast against it. At a
special meeting of the city council
on Monday evening the franchise
was formally accepted. By thtf
terms of the franchise this will set
tle the dispute between the Electric
Co. and the city over the rate to be
charged for pumping the city water
which was recently tried in the dis
trict court and tnen appealed to the
supreme court. It will also mean a
change in the ownership of the Leon
Electric Co., the owners, Francis
Varga and Mrs. S. Varga, having
closed a contract for the sale of the
plant to the David G. Fisher Engin
eering Co., of Davenport, Iowa, con
tingent upon securing the new fran
chise, and ihey are expected here
this week to close up the transfer of
the property.
IS NOW PAST 104 YEARS OLD.
tJiicle John Pliipps, of Shenandoah,
Celebrated his 104th Birth
day Monday.
Uncle John Phipps, father of Mrs.
F. A. Garaner, of Leon, is the oldest
man in Iowa, and one of the oldest
in the United States. He celebratea
his 104th birthday on last Monday,
St. Valentine's Day, and is now en
tering on his 105th birthday. Uncle
John has reached a ripe old age, and
the grippe was no respector of age,
for he had a very severe attack of it
a few weeks ago and was compelled
to remain in the house which wor
ried him a great deal, but he is now
in much better health. He also en
joys the distinction of being the old
est Elk in the world, having become
a charter member of the Elk's lodge
at Shenandoah on his 100th birthday.
He makes his home with his son who
resides between Shenandoah and
Farragut, but frequently comes to
Leon to visit his daughter, and not
withstanding his great age still
travels alone. He was born in Wash
ington county, Virginia, on February
14, 1812, which was prior to the
declaration *f -war against England.
His twin brother, Eli Phipps, dtefl
at his home in Oklahoma about five
years ago, a short time before he
reached his 10 0th birthday ,'
Editorial Convention Held at Des
Moines.
The first annual convention of the
new Iow& State Press Association
was held at Des Moines last Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday, and it was
the greatest editorial convention ev
er held in the west, there being more
than three hudred of the live wire
editors of Iowa in attendance. The
program .embraced some of the best
talent in the United States, includ
ing Arthur Brisbane, editor of the
New York Evening Journal, who
commands a salary of more than
|100,000 a year, Major E. E. Critch
field of the Taylor-Critchfield-Clague
Co., of Chicago, A. L. Lasker, presi
dent of the Lord & Thomas Advertis
ing Agency, "Ding," the Register and
Leader's cartoonist, the best in the
whole country, and other celebrities.
The editors were guests of the Great
er Des Moines Committee at a ban
quet at the Chamberlin Jiotel on
Thursday evening. Every minute of
the three days session w$s utilized,
and much more time could have been
used had it been, available. The
newspapers of Iowa rank among the
best in the world, and the publishers
are regarded among the leading bus
inessmen of the state. The new
State Press Association, which has
employed G. L. Caswell, of Denison,
as field secretary, at a good salary,
is going to do gfeat things for the
newspaper fraternity of Iowa. We
hope that before long every pub
lisher in the state will be enrolled as
a member. The officers who have
served- during the past year, presi
dent P. S. Junkin of Creston, secre
tary O. E. Hull of Leon, jand treas
urer E. E. Johnston, of Iowa City,
were till re-elected for- the coming
year.
Court House Elevator Weight Drop
ped.
Clerk of the„aistrict court E. E.
Beck thought for a few minutes last
Friday that he had wrecked the court
house. He was just in .the act of
pulling up the elevator used to move
the court records from the clerk's
office to the court room when the
rope holding the elevator weight,
which weighs about a hundred
pounds, broke and the heavy weight
fell from the top of the elevator shaft
to the bottom. It seems that in
building the elevator the wire lath
ing used had been left too close to
the elevator rope and constant use
had caused the wire to slowly cut
the rope. The weight struck the
concrete ceiling of tiie men's toilet
room and broke a hole through .it
but the wire reinforcement held and
the weight did not fall through.

ANOTHER CASH BUSINESS FOR
LEON.
Jas. ,\V. Hurst it Co. Will Adopt this
Modern Method on March 1st.
As will oe seen by their announce
ment in this issue the firm of Jas.
W. Hurst & Co., will inaugurate a
cash system ai their big Leon store
on March 1st. They have carefully
considered this proposition after do
ing a creait business for many years
and have decided that it is to the in
terest .of their customers as well as
themselves to place their business on
a cash basis, which will enable them
to buy for cash as well as sell for
cash, and this will give them a decid
ed advantage in their buying. They
expect to share the extra profitB
with their customers by giving them
cash prices on all goods. This sys
tem has been adopted by tne larger
stores in many cities and it has
proven entirely satisfactory to a
large majority of their customers. It
means that cash buyers can purchase
goods at a less price than where they
are solu on credit, and does away
with the inequality of compelling a
cash buyer to pay the same price
for goods that another customer
buys on long time. J. W. Hurst &
Co. have a model store and have
been enjoying an unprecedented big
business, and they propose to keep
right up in the front ranks with tneir
business methods as well as their
goods.
A Fox Hunt.
Plans aro beirg made to hold a fox
hunt northeast of Leon on next Sat
urday. Quite a number were out last
Saturday, but several had no ammu
nition and the two foxes which were
found escaped. The present plans
are to take in the territory bounded
by Rue Stone's on the north, Frank
Garber's on the south, Brice McDon
ough's on the west and Frank Git
tinger's on the east.
Those from the southwest can
meet at Frank Garber's, from ihe
soutneast at John Wasson's, north
east at Rue Stone's and northwest at
Brice McDonough's. All are to meet
at 10 o'clock and communications by
phone will be made on all sides be
fore starting.
Everyone bring shot guns loa led
with heavy shot and if dogs are
brought they should be kept tioi
until needed.
Rue Stone, Brice McDonough, John
Wasson and Frank Garber will be
the captains and look after the lined
on their respective sides.
Everyone keep calling all along
the lines. This will help to drivo
me foxets^ahsad and keep- them from
breaking'through the lines.
l^he plans are to drive them into
the open meadow southeast of Frank
Long's house.- Rifles are dangerous
so bring shot guns if possible and be
careful where you shoot.
Be on hand promptly' at 10 a. in.
Parent-Teachers Meeting
The Parent-Teachers Association
meets at 7:30 Friday evening, Feb.
18th in the High School building.

hope to have an extra large attend
ance.

tions are up for discussion. Come
prepared to discuss'any or all of
them and to suggest others you
would like to hear discussed.

follows:
Exercise, Miss Crawford's grade.
Music, High School.
Questions for discussion:
"If your child had adenoids would
you want to know it?"
"Shall we continue to'allow High
School boys to use bacco?"
"Should the social life of rhe
school pupils be centered in the
school?"
Lost Her Home.
Mrs. Belle Hinds lost her home
juBt south of the Presbyterian church
by a fire which was discovered just
before midnight last Friday night.
Mrs. Hinds, %ho had been living with
a sister, had moved in most of her
goods to the house that day, and
had started a fire in a stove to warm
up the house and it is supposed the
fire started from a defective flue.
When discovered the flames had
made good headway, and owing to
the fact that tne hydrant was frozen
up, which delayed the fire depart
ment, the house could not be saved,
and was a total loss together with
all the contents. Mrs. Hinds had
|400 insurance on tne house and a
small insurance on her household
goods.
Won Corn Prizes at Ames.
William Lowrance, of Morgan
township, has received notice that
he won three places in the single ear
of the corn contest in the state
contest
recently held at the State College at
Ames. That is pretty good ior ue
catur county, for we have heard
some people say that you could not
raise good corn in Morgan township,
but Mr. Lowrance has demonstrated
they can compete* with any part of
the state.

A REAL SPECIAL.
"The Christian," Hall Cable's Su
perb Love Story at the Idle Hour.
On next Monday, Feb. 21st, the
popular Idle Hour theatre will pre
sent to their patrons the Vitagraph
Liebler Feature Film Co.'s stupen
dous production in 500 scenes with
an ail star cast of Vitagraph players,
Hall Caine's superb love story in
eight big reels, "The Christian." In
this (production 3000 people were
used.
"The Christian' is the best acting
film ever made. Edith Storey, as
Glory Quayle, lives a vivid imper
sonation oi Viola Allen's greatest
part. Her performance will stand
comparison with the best dramatic
stars. She is splendid, artistic, won
derful. Earle Williams, in portray
ing John Storm—a type of man who
is almost a religious fanatic, accom
plishes equally brilliant work as
Miss Storey. It is the best of the
many great performances he has
given the screen. In their support
is the finest cast of Vitagraph Stars
ever seen in one picture. Charles
Kent, Harry Northrup, James Lack
aye, Alberta Gallatin, Carlotta de
Felice, Edward Kimball, James Mor
rison, J. W. Sambrook, Donald Hall,
Jane Fearnley and many others. It
required more than six months to
make the picture, which was staged
under the Vitagraph's ablest direc
tors.
