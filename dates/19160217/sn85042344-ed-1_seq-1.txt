NEW DEVELOPMENTS
DELAY SETTLEMENT
Germany's Latest Declara
tion Adds New Danger
to Negotiations.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 16. The
submarine controversy with
Germany cannot be closed until the
1'nlted States has fully considered the
possible effect of the declared Inten
tion of the Germanic powers to sink
all armed merchant ships of their ene
mies without warning after Februury
29.
This announcement was made by
Secretary Lansing today Instead of
the long expected announcement of a
satisfactory settlement of the Lusl
tania negotiations.
Perfected by months of patient ana
at times perilous negotiations the
Lusltanta agreement was presented
today by Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador. In a form which
would have been acceptable to the
I'nited States had not the Germanic
powers announced their determination
to regard armed merchant ships of
their enemies as warships.
Tho Lusltanla agreement now will
not be accepted as finally satisfactory
to- the United States until President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing have
decided whether any of its terms
would be nullified by the principles
of the new submarine campaign.
If Republicans Are Not Going to Run
a City Ticket, Then Let's Have
a Business Man's Ticket.
Tho bedraggled remnants of the Democratic party In the city of Tulsa,
after having proven their utter unwnrthincss of the confidence and support
of un Intelligent electorate by their own double dealing, are trying to patch
up the wreckage and go before the people again asking that they be given
another chance to prove their crookedness. In our mind's eye we see "the
old hag with a tattered shawl about her- shoulders, out at the elbows,
brass Jewelry in her ears, with a drunken leer of silly invitation upon her
countenance inviting tho youth of the land to do business with her again
upon the purity of her principles and platform pledges." Pure rot and
drivel. The same identical pledges by the same Identical backers have
b'.-en made by the Democratic party ever since the first tie was laid by the
FMsco railroad within the city limits of Tulsa. They stand convicted upon
every count in the bill of particulars and their effrontery is not exceeded
by the cheek of a government mule. Any man who would accept a nom
ination at the hands of such a band of political double-crossers and double
dealers is convicted of duplicity or imbecility beyond tho peradveiituro of
a doubt. What's the use of arguing a fact so patent that all who run may
read and understand. "We've reformed, we've turned out and kicked out
those men who deceived us and misrepresented us In the past," cries the
yellow dog Democrat as he goes yelping down the street looking for an
alley In which to escape from an accusing conscience and a well Informed
public.
The reformers have quit the field and are going to ho extended tho
right hand of fellowship by the wrecking crew who have taken charge of
the decrepit old machine. The time for candidates to file Is less than a
month away and yet the old Democratic shrews are the only outfit offer
ing to put up a ticket. Republicans, knowing the situation and under
standing the conditions, are refusing to put forward party candidates
against the opposition. They hesitate to go up against the combination.

AMERICANS TELL OF
DELAYS IN MEXICO
WASHINGTON, ,Feb. 16. A dis
patch today to the state department
from the Mexican border told of the
difficulties encountered by eight
Americans and a number of other
foreigners in getting from Chihuahua
to El Paso. The train on which they
traveled was held at Chihuahua four
days because of a strike of railroad
men and reports that Villa's men
were operating along the line between
Chlhuuhua and the border.
The strike was reported duo to a
demand of the men that they be paid
In silver instead of depreciated paper
money. It ended with an agreement
with the men to accept one-half of
their wuges In silver and one half in
paper.
Tho train was escorted by three
hundred and fifty soldiers. From
this number seventy-five were
dropped at various stations.
Assurances were given by tho Car
ranza foreign office at Guadalajara
that the acting governor of Vera
Cms had reported that he had given
"appropriate orders" for the protec
tion of the oil properties In tho Chap
apote and Potrero districts near Tux
pan. Rebels recently have been ac

The immediate effect of the Itus

however, for despire the roads the
country is mountainous and there
still is much ground to be covered
something over two hundred miles
before the Ijike I'ruiuiah district of
Persia Is reached and over six hun

With the advent of stormy weather

operations. Iteriin reports, however,
that th, liritish ami French have en
deavored to recapture trench positions
taken from them by the Germans re
spectively southeast ol Yprcs and in
contrary that near Tahure the French
attacks' failed. Paris reports on tho
contrary that near Tahiic the French
have retaken portions of their former

The liritish aiul Cermann are still
at deadly grips for possession of too

The question of submarine warfare

PLAN ADJOURNMENT
ON NEXT SATURDAY
Senator Thomas Takes Hot
Shot at "Uecord" of
Special Session.
(By Staff Corronnndent.)
OKLAHOMA CITY, Fel. Hi. With
the usury bill passing in the sen
ate, the house killing the penitentiary
coal mine bill and also tho poll tax
hill, tho legislature today paced the
way for possible adjournment on Sat
urday of this week, if there Is any
light made on the usury bill and the
two election laws la the house, how
ever, them Is no chance for adjourn
ment before the first of next week.
The passage of the usury bill In the
senate is considered an accomplish
ment, as the subject had been consid
ered for tho past two weeks and
numerous hills and substitutes und
amendments had been offered before
they finally agreed on a bill thut will
not contain more than eight hundred
words.
The subject matter of the bill Is
cumulative to the usury laws now in
force. One section Is new matter. It
provides that when u note is due, the
borrower may tender the principal
with Interest at the contract rate o(
10 per cent and if the lender refuses
to accept this then the obligation Is
automatically cancelled. It also Is
provided that w hen a state bank
charges usurious interest With the
knowledge and acquiescence of the
bank officials and directors, that the
governor may direct the banking
commissioner to cancel the bank's
charter and liquidate it.
Mine Bill killed.
The killing of the hill to establish
a convict coal mine at the peniten
tiary came in an unfavorable recom
mendation of the committee nf the
whole in the house. Tho establish
ment of a coal mine at tho peniten
tiary was one of the pet subjects of
the governor and the board ot affairs.
They claiimd that such a scheme
would save the state much money on
the coal hill. The proposition was
Htrcnuously opposed by tho laboring
Interests of the state. An attempt to
establish a twine factory at tho prison
was killed some days ago.
Representative Sains. Republican,
made an unsuccessful attempt to
bring from the committee on priv
ileges and elections some report con
cerning the numerous petitions that
have been received during the session
from all parts of the state urging
that no election laws he passed thut
would further disfranchise voters, as
Ihe petitions were received they were
referred, many of them without being
read, to the committee on privileges
and elections. They were never acted
on nor reported back In nny way.
Sam's resolution offered this after
noon asked the committee for Infor
mation as to how many petitions had
been received ami the number of
names they contained. This Informa
tion, ho thought, should be before the
bouse as they would within tho next
day, perhaps, he called on to pass the
election laws that had been intro
duced and passed and in the senate.

NKW York, Fh. HI. Xo evidence
oi' incendiarism has been found, It
was announced tonight, in connection
with the tire on the Brooklyn wntoc
front early today which caused tha
destruction ot three British steam
ships, IIT lighters and barges, a neir
iiiuj-foot pier belonging to the Xew
York Dock company and Jl.U00.0Oi)
worth of merchandise consigned to the
entente allies. The total loss Is esti
mated at between three million ami
lour million dollars.
Although nearly three hundred per
sons were Imperilled by the flames,
which raged fiercely for several hours,
only one man, a member of the crew
oi one of the steamers, was unac
counted for tonight. Several persona
were injured, however, and there wer
many sensational rescues.
There were reports throughout the
day that the fire was started by an
Incendlury but they probably wer
based on the fact that the immense
quantity of merchandise on board the
vessels and on the pier was destined
for Kuropcan governments now on
gaged in war. A rigid. Investigation
conduetod by officials of the tire de
partment has convinced them that de
fective tlcctlrc wiring waa responsible
lor the flumes.
