PLANUM
AUTO SHOW ARE
WELL IHDt WAV
NEW YORK AUTO SHOW WILL
NOT HAVE ANYTHING OYER
THE MINOT SHOW ARMORY
WILL BE TRANSFORMED.
I All arrangements are practically
completed for the big Northwestern
North Dakota Auto and Motorcycle
Show to be held in the Armory at Mi
not, March 8, 9, 10 and 11, and much
of the billing thruout the northwest
em part of the state has been done,
and already word has been received
from various points that a large num­
ber of people are going to attend the
show.
Minot is now considered the center
of the northwestern district of the
state, automobilically speaking, and
from the number of general district
agents now located here there is no
reason why this coming show will not
be a thorough success in every way.
The committee having charge of the
event is sparing no expense in making
it the great success predicted. The
Armory will be transformed into a
fairy palace for the occasion, the
whole interior of the edifice being re­
built for the occasion. Several car­
loads of material is being used in this
construction, and when the whole
thing is completed the interior will re­
semble a Hindu temple. The whole
structure will be painted ivory white,
which will be a fine setting for the
dark painted cars of various design
that will be shown. The lighting ef­
fect will be excellent, all the light
globes being hidden and casting their
softened rays upon the assembled
cars, thus giving them a beautiful ap­
pearance, without the glare of ex­
posed lighting.
Several of the district agents are al­
ready planning upon calling in all
their sub-agents during the week and
making it a gala occasion with a ban­
quet as a fitting close. The first esti-
Sie
ate of cars that will be sold during
week runs over the 1000 mark,
and it is safe to say that this esti­
mate is low-
The firms participating in the event
are making great plans for the four
days, and many surprises will be
sprung at that time.
The booths, as stated, are being con­
structed along the Hindu style of ar­
chitecture. They are being built in
sections so that they can be used an­
other year. Next year, for instance,
they will be repainted and re-decor­
ated, .and with a few minor changes
will present an entirely different per­
spective. If a large building can be
secured next year all that will be
needful will be to add extra booths to
the equipment, and all visitors will
fail to recognize the booths as those
used this year. This is in the line of
economy, for next year booths can be
sold for less money.
Remember the dates of this great
show—March 8, ,9, 10 and 11. Mary
your calendar so that you will not for­
get the occasion.
"DEEM" MAY BE
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
FORMER MINOT OPERATIVE SAID
TO HAVE CAUSED FAMILY
TROUBLE AT DEVILS LAKE
HUSBAND LAYS MATTER BE­
FORE STATE'S ATTORNEY.
According to the Devils Lake Jour­
nal, Roger L. Lewis, alias Robert Lutz,
former Superior, Wis., detective, con
victed recently on the charge of kid
napping, and liable to sentence of
from five to twenty years in the peni­
tentiary, faces the possible additional
charges of attempted seduction and
home breaking.
That Lewis made advances toward
his wife, writing her notes that he
lured her away from her home at Dev­
ils Lake Tuesday for a cutter ride,
and later in the day met her at the G.
N. station, where he gave her $5 and
later phoned her when she reached
Rugby, is the story told today by a
Devils Lake husband.
The young wife was followed to
Rugby by her husband. At Rugby the
woman returned to her senses and ac­
companied her husband home. Notes
which the man wrote, who signed him­
self Lewis, and received by the wife,
are in the hands of the husband. The
whole, matter has been laid before the
state's attorney.
This is evidently the same "detec­
tive" who operated in Minot.

FARMING LEVY
IMPORTANT CASE DECIDED BY
THE SUPREME COURT WILL
PROVE OF INTEREST TO MANY
COUNTIES OF THE STATE.
The case of William Westlake, et al,
against the board of county commis­
sioners, petitoning the Court to issue
a writ of mandamus compelling the
Board of County Commissioners to
make a levy of a tax for the purpose
of carrying on scientific farming and
agricultural development in Ward
county, was affirmed by the Supreme
court. This case was tried before
Judge Leighton of the district court
and a writ of mandamus was issued
out of said court ordering the county
commissioners to make a tax levy in
accordance with the petition of Wil­
liam Westlake and 1115 other farm­
ers interested in scientific farming
and agricultural department. The
case was appealed to the Supreme
court by O. B. Herigstad, assistant
state's attorney, and Arthur M.
Thompson appeared for the respon­
dents. This case has been watched
with much interest throughout the en­
tire state as there are a number of
counties in the state carrying on this
agricultural work. It was in the na­
ture of a test case to determine the
constitutionality of the law granting
to the county commissioners the power
and authority to make a levy for said
purpose. There are a large number of
farmers in this county interested in
this work and who are receiving much
benefit therefrom.
Northwest Motor Co. Secures 100 Ad­

day, where he spent two weeks trans­
acting business with the Dodge Motor

Dodge cars for his territory, making
a total of some five or six hundred
cars, and years that there will not be
enough to go around. Prospects for
a big automobile business are so good
that Mr. Fuller is contemplating mak
ing some extensive changes, to be an­
nounced later.
SLOPE FARMER SETS
A NEW RECORD FOR
WALKING IN SLEEP,
New Leipsig, N. D., Feb. 14.—To
jump out of a second story window,
sustaining a serious gash on the right
side of the abdomen, then walk a mile
to a neighbor's farm during 20 below
zero weather and clad in a nightshirt,
all without waking up until his neigh­
bor, Reinhold Werre, spoke to him,
was the sleep-walking record estab­
lished by John Kuck, a farmer near
here. A physician was called and
found Kuck's feet and legs badly froz­
en, and that it required many stitches
to close the wound in his abdomen. He
was taken to a hospital today for
treatment.
PEOPLE IN
ROYAL SOCIETY
MR. AND MRS. JAMES JOHNSON
ENTERTAINED BY HONOLULU
PRINCESS—WERE PROMINENT
HOUSE GUESTS.
r,i
I 1
The Independent has received a
copy of the Pacific Commercial Ad­
vertiser under date of Jan. 26. telling
I of the splendid entertainments given
Hon. and Mrs. James Johnson during
their recent visit to Honolulu:
"Princess Theresa Wilcox-Bellievieu
has as house guests Mr. and Mrs.
James Johnson and Mr. and Mrs. W.
H. Mueller. Mr. Mueller is mayor of
St. Peter, Minnesota, and Mr. Johnson
is the ex-state's attorney of Ward
county, North Dakota. Yesterday was
spent by the princess and her guests,
in calling on the governor and mayor
and a trip around the island by auto­
mobile. Lunch was eaten at the Hotel
Aubrey and the journey continued af­
ter a rest of a couple of hours. The
guests of_ the princess are being urg­
ed by their hostess to remain over for
the Carnival. The men of the party
are old friends of the former delegate
to congress, Robert W. Wilcox."
From the above, it will be seen that
the "man from Burlington" has been
mixing with the powers that be. They
were guests at a native party where
the best people of Honolulu gathered
to witness the christening of a baby.
A feast of native foods was served
and the former Royal dancers per­
formed for the occasion. Mr. and Mrs.
Johnson were the honored guests of
many entertainments and they must
have enjoyed their visit in Honolulu
to its fullest extent.
They have reached San Francisco
and are expected home in a month.
Non-Partisan Leader Raps Geo.

able political publicity in the Non­

tion of that organization.
