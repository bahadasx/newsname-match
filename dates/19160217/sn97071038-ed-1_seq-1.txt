52ND AN NIVERSARY
Doric Lodge No. 20 Presents Jewels
to Veterans Who Have Been
Faithful Members for Twenty-Five
Veurs.
Doric Lodge No. 20, Knights of
Pythias, held commemoration exer
cises in I. 0. 0. P. hall in this city
last Tuesday evening in honor of the
62nd anniversary of the founding of
the order. The feature of the occa
sion was the presentation by the local
lodge of veteran jewels to members
who have been affiliated with Doric
lodge for 25 years. Those members
who were entitled to this honor are
Phill Cohn, James Cowins and W. B.
Barratt of Heppner, Vawter Craw
ford of lone, J. R. Simons and E. R.
Hunlock of Portland, and E. S. Keith
ley of Napa, California. Only two
of the above-named, W. B. Barratt
and Vawter Crawford, were able to
be present at the presentation cere
mony. Willard L. Marks of Albany, Grand
Chancellor of Knights of Pythias for
Oregon, addressed the Knights and
their friends assembled on the "Prac
tical Phases of Pythianism." The ad
dress of the Grand Chancellor,, was re
plete with oratorical eloquence in
which he paid tribute of high order
to this fraternity which has made
such a remarkable growth in 52
years. Mr. Marks was followed by
Walter C. Gleeson of Portland, Grand
Keeper of Records and Seal, who
spoke on the value of doing, little
things for good. Mr. Gleeson has
been with the Grand Lodge only since
last October, having succeeded Lou
R. Stinson, who was for 19 years
Grand Keeper of Records and Seal.
The addresses by the Grand Lodge
officers were interspersed with music
which was furnished by Redifer'B
orchestra and pleasing solos were
sung by Mr. and Mrs. 0. G. Craw
ford. At the conclusion of the program
the Knights and their guests sat down
to a clam feed in the banquet hail
which came up fully to the former
feeds which the knights have given.

ning. OFFICERS CONFISCATE
LARGE STORE OF BOOZE
Sheriff Georire McDuffee and his
deputy, Willard Herren, made a raid
on the 0. K. restaurant tills week and
found a large quantity of beer and
whiskey which they at once took
possession of and hauled it to the
court house. Ma Shoot, the Chinese
proprietor, was charged with keeping
on his premises intoxicating liquor
for the purpose of selling.
The trial of Ma Shoot is taking
place in Justice Cornett's court this
afternoon. The defendant is being
represented by Sam E. VanVactor,
and Glenn Y. Wells, county attorney,
is prosecuting for the state. A jury
has been selected to try the case.
The confiscated booze was found in
a store room at the rear of the res
taurant. Ma Shoot and his family
also live in the same building. It will
probably be up to the jury to decide
as to whether the intoxicants were
kept in a public place or not. Con
siderable interest la being taken in
the case.
REV. T. S. HANDSAKER
TO GO TO SAN DIEGO
Rev. T. S. Handsaker has tendered
his resignation as pastor of the First
Christian church of this city and has
accepted a call from the University
Heights church in San Diego, Califor
nia. The local board accepted his
resignation at a special meeting Wed
nesday evening. He will take up his
new work the first of April and ex
pects to leave Heppner about the 20th
of March.
The University Heights church has
a large membership, but the thing
which appeals to Rev. Handsaker and
his wife, is the fact that the church
Is near a normal school of large en
rollment. In Corvallis Mr. Hanflsa-
ker met with success In his work
among the studentB of the state ag
ricultural college and this line of
work anneals to him strongly.
The Heppner church feels indeed
fortunate that they have been able
to hold the Handsakers here as biig
as they have, and rejoice in the fact
that they are going to a field where
bigger work will be done.
COUNTY SCHOOL NOTES
By Supt. S. E. Notson.
State Superintendent Churchill has
designated March 7 as Burbank Day
for the schools of the state. Withhi
a few days each teacher will receive
a circular containing suggestions as
to the way in which the day may be
observed. Let us make the day one
worth the while. Luther Burbank
has done a great work for the world,
and it is fitting that we should show
our appreciation before he leaves his
present held of labor.
It would be perfectly in keeping
with the proper observance of Bur
bank Day for those schools which
have not done so, to organize their
industrial clubs. I presume each
teacher has received the information
from the Agricultural College in re
gard to the plans for this year. If
not, write Prof. H. C. Seymor, at Cor
vallis, for the circulars of informa
tion. This year, those who aro of
club age will not be permitted to en
ter any exhibits at the county fair ex
cept club exhibits. This does not
mean that you must belong to a club,
but you must enroll for club work
and do project work. There will be
some miscellaneous prizes for pupils
under the club age, but none for
those of club age. We have advanced
to that place now where the pupils,
patrons, and teachers understand the
educational value of the industrial
work, and it is not necessary to at
tempt to pay each pupil for his work
in order to get them to do industrial
work. The pupils are beginning to
see that the biggest prize is in what
they learn by doing the work. How
ever, we expect to make the prizes
worth the while, but the ribbon will
be more highly appreciated, no doubt,
than the money. I trust that many
clubs will be organized on Burbank
Day, and that those already organ
ized will make the day one of profit.
Senator Lane has sent a quantity
of garden and flower seeds to the of
fice. Pupils who contemplate doing
something In the line gf gardening
may have the seeds if they will call
or write for them.
As the warm days tempt the pupils
to play vigorously, they are apt to
come into the schoolroom quite
warm. Often they, will throw open
the windows and sit in a current of
air for some time to "cool off
Teachers should see to it that no pu
pil sits thus in a draft. It may mean
discomfort for a short time, but it is
better to be somewhat uncomfortable
for a few minutes than to tnke a
evere cold. If the room caa not be
ventilated properly without a pupil
sitting in a draft, it is advisable to
have the pupils move about or take
some light, caiistuentic exercises
while the windows are opened wide.
Many teachers neglect to see that
there is provision made for intro
ducing moisture Into the atmosphere
of the School room. As I have sug
gested before, a tall baking powder
can filled with water and kept on the
stove will answer the purpose very
well.
Kpisoopul Church Services.
Rev. George B. VanWaters, of
Portland, will hold services both
morning and evening in the Episco
pal church next Sunday. Owing to
delayed train service. Rev VanWaters
was unable to arrive in Heppner last
Sunday as was announced. The pub
lic is cordially invited.
John Olden, of Rhea creek, was in

IRRIGATION MEETING IN
SALEM ON MARCH 9TH
Portland, February 15, 1910 The
State Irrigation, Drainage & Rural
Credits conference authorized by the
Oregon Irrigation Congress will be
held at the Statehouse in Salem,
March 9. Call for the conference has
been inssued by the special commit
tee which was given the responsibil
ity and more than half the delegates
from representative state organiza
tions have been appointed. The con
ference delegates are asked to for
mulate a plan for state guaranty of
irrigation and drainage securities and
a system of State Rural Credits.
It is proposed to draft a constitu
tional amendment for submission to
the people at the next general elec
tion. The conference will probably
decide whether to submit enabling
legislation at the general election or,
later, to the legislature.
Already there is sweeping the Btate
conviction that no more important
gathering has ever been planned in
Oregon. It will have the bigness and
serious responsibility of a constitu
tional convention. The best brains
and experience from all walks of life
and all occupations will be represent
ed and will be called upon to produce
the plan, which when enacted into
law, and administered, will 'Solve the
state's great development "problems
of irrigation and drainage." All au
thorities financiers and farmers,
railroad men and organized labor
have made statements recognizing
the necessity of action and support
ing the fundamental character of the
procedure outlined. The only doubt
has been as to whether, prejudices
and differences can be laid aside in
the common purpose to do now a big
thing for Oregon,
Because of the great public Inter
est. in, and the significance of, the
conference, many will probably jour
ney to the state capital from all parts
of the state to witness the proceed
ings, their concern keener, even, than
if it had been a session of the Legis
lature which they had come to attend.
UK NEWS FROM
Quiet prevails In this little burg
and things have settled down to their
normal condition since the big snow
is. practically all gone. It was men
tioned in these items last Issue that
high water was doing no small
amount of damage to the ranchers at
the confluence of Rhea and Willow
creeks, and since the waters have
subsided, it is quite apparent that a
number of the people at that point
have suffered to a considerable de
gree. The water cut through the
places of Alex Lindsay, Gus Wilcox,
T. B. Buffington and Frank Akers,
the latter two perhaps sustaining the
Heaviest loss. Sediment to the dentil
of a toot and more has been deposited
over a large portion of the alfalfa
fields, and this will doubtless prove
beneficial. The residents below lone
and as far as Cecil suffered in like
manner but the sum total of damage
done will not be large. For a time
it was expected that the levee at this
point would break and the town be
flooded quite extensively, and this
would doubtless have occurred had
the flood waters of Willow creek and
Rhea creek reached this place at the
same time. As stated above, the dan
ger passed over and all apprehension
from floods has ceased and our peo
ple are pursuing the even tenor of
their way.
The sad accident at the Gus Wil
cox place on Thursday morning, in
which Pete Brad st his life, cast
somewhat of a g-OBJ over the com
munity. When tiREiport came down
that the young m j was in the creek,
a searching pari, was immediately
organized and tl . stream was thor
oughly searched but to no avail. The
body was found early on Saturday
morning in the old channel at the
rear of the Frank Akers place, nearly
two miles below where it went into
the creek.
W. T. Craig, who was in from Ella
Monday, states that the snow, has not
disappeared from the hills out that
w&y, and the feeding of stock still
goes on. Some farmers in that vi
cinity have run very short on feed,
and are hoping that a break will
come and such weather conditions
prevail as will bring forth the grass.

BD MISSION NO FAIL-
E
University of Oregon, Eugene, Feb.
12. The Henry Ford peace expedi
tion has only begun its real work. Re
sults lie in the future and depend on
the work of the neutral conference
which the expedition has sscured.
This is the opinion of Lamar Tooze,
University of Oregon delegate on the
peace mission, who returned to col
lege yesterday morning.
"The two principal purposes of the
mission were to attract worldwide
attention to the cause of peace, and
to enlist the support of the neutral
countries of Europe. I am convinced
that this far the mission has accom
plished all it set out to do," said Mr.
Tooze, "even though newspaper read
ers laughed."
In Europe, as well as in the United
States, the mission attracted general
attention, Mr. Tooze said. As to the
second purpose, an unofficial confer
ence of representatives from Ameri
ca, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
Holland will meet with "permanent
peace, or none at all" as its slogan.
On this conference the results of
the Ford peace expedition will de
pend. It will draw up peace propos
als and present them simultaneously
to all the fighting nations. Presum
ably, these proposals will not recog
nize existing military advantage, but
will, however, allude specifically to
the Belgian and Balkan situations.
The conference will dissolve itself
automatically to leave internation
al diplomacy unembarassed.
One reason that so much American
"humor" has been directed against
the mission is that the fifty newspa
per people who went along were all
"enterprising." "Fight in the Peace
Party" was irresistible to a humor
loving correspondent, Mr. Tooze sug
gested. But the dissension reported
was more animated discussion than
active opposition he said. "It was part
of Mr. Ford's idea to make his mis
sion represent different opinions ex
cept on the one issue, peace in Eu
rope." A half million dollars so Mr.
Tooze was told might cover the cost
of the expedition. All legitimate ex
penses of the delegates, including
laundry and necessary taxlcab bills,
were cared for by Mr. Ford. Seven
ty-two thousand dollars alone was
paid for passage in the Oscar. The
return passage doubled this. The
captain of the boat was given a Ford
automobile and a vlctrola. The stew
ards in the dining salons received
$50 each and the stokers $10. A
bonus of $50,000 in addition to regu
lar fares was required to get a spec
ial train across Germany the first
that had crossed the empire since war
broke out, j
Mr. Tooze has been Invited, since
his return, to speak in Eugene, Dal
las, Falls City, Oregon City, Wood-
burn, Salem and Portland.

TIME TO HATCH FOR
GOOD WINTER LAYERS
The farmer who is successful in
getting his hens to lay when eggs are
high in price, hatches the chicks ear
ly enough In the season so they will
have time to mature before cold
weather sets in, but not so early that
they will mature In warm weather
and when cold weather comes stop
laying and go into moult, says Mr.
Dryden of O. A. C. Experiment Sta
tion. This is an important point for
the poultryman.
For Leghorns, and other small
breeds, the best time on the average
to hatch them is about the beginning
of April or from March 20 to April
20. Chicks that are hatched within
these dates with the proper care
throughout the summer, will make
the best late fall and winter layers.
If hatched a month earlier they will
mature early and usually go into a
moult and stop laying when eggs are
at their highest. For heavier breeds
that require longer to mature, the
hatching season should be earlier.
For Plymouth Rocks and breeds of
that size, about the middle of March
Is a very good time, or any time be
tween March 1 and April 1. There is
very little profit in pullets that have
been hatched later than the first of
May. While it is possible to hasten
or retard laying maturity by regulat
ing the feeding and care, with good
average care the 'dates given above
will be about right.

GAME WARDEN HOT ON
TRAIL OF BIRD KILLERS
Game Warden Robert II. Young is
hot on the trail of pheasant shooters
and last week arrested Henry Pliess,
a farmer south of Heppner. Mr.
Pliess pleaded guilty and was fined
$100. Pliess then implicated Charles
Crites, a young man who lives in the
same neighborhood. Crites pleaded
his innocence and after being ar
raigned in Justice Cornett's court,
was found not guilty. Pliess also
'peached" on a German, Emil Wolf,
but Wolf came up missing when his
trial was called for Monday morning
at 10 o'clock.
Morrow county has taken pride in

WRITER BELIEVES DOG
POISONER DANGEROUS
It is hard to believe we have in
our midst someone who is dstribut
ing scraps of meat poisoned with
strychnine about the city to kill poor,
innocent dogs, which in many cases
belong to children who are wrapped
up in them and the loss of which
causes them to be almost heart-broken.
Of course we know that no sane
person would do such a low sneaking
trick. It takes a degenerate of the
lowest type to do such a thing and
we regret that such a person is in
Heppner. But unfortunately we can
not deny the fact. Such persons al
lowed to run at large are dangerous
to the community as any one whose
mental faculties are so unbalanced
may poison a little innocent child as
well as a poor innocent, unsuspect
ing, harmless dog. Probably the
only thing that saves our children
from being poisoned by such sneak
ing scoundrels is the fear of a prison
sentence. So let us hope and pray
that this fear will increase rather
than diminish.
