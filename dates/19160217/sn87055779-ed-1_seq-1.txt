Showing" their reasons for ap-

Hohools ami urging the citizens of
South Rend to take some kind of
action t. bring about that end.
about ?,(.) letters have been mailed
by .school tearhers to Himer Crockett
ii.s chairman of the citizens" com
mittee. Practically every instructor
in the city was in on the organized
letter-writing proposition, thore 4e
ln .'127 teachers in all of the schools.
A deliberate walkout on the part
of the teachers has- been thought of,
but It is hardly pr ha bio that such
strenuous action will be taken, ac
cording; to one of the leaders of the
Montgomery faction. Those who
have sui;gesled such a means of se
curing Mr." Montgomery's reappoint
ment have said that it would be re
sorted to only after everything else
had failed.
School teachers are .waiting for
nme action from the citizens before
doinp anything. A meeting of
prominent business 'men probably
will be held not later than Friday
nicht and it was possible that a
meeting would be called for this
evening. Although Mr. Crockett
Mas addrcv.-ed as the chairman of
the citizens' committee, he has not
virtly been chosen the head of
that organization.
.Miller I 'or Montgomery. -
Judge W. F. Miller, who took
considerable interest in the school
pr oposlt ion when it was up before,
is in Washington, I. ('. I'.efore
leaving here Judge Miller left word
that he would return to South Rend,
if ho mtild do anything' to assist Mr.
Montgomery.
High school teachers are said to
be about evenly divided In their ap
proval and dlsa -proval of Mr.
Montgomery as superintendent. One
of the instructors at the hiph school
Kald Thursday morning that those
v.-ho were against him took that
stand, because Mr. Montgomery re
fused to raise their salaries. The
opposition of John A. Ryers, prin
cipal of the eighth grade, is based
mainly, it is said, on his failure to
ret more money.

"Ray no attention t the signed
denial given out by Principal Ryers
today, to which he secured the sig
iiatu,res of the grammar school
teat hers, to the effect that he had
r.ever attempted to influence them in
their attitude toward Mr. Montgom-
tv." said one of the teachers over
the telephone Thursday. "The sig
natures were obtained after the
samo manner as he has succeeded in
keeping us ouiet in our opposition
to Mr. Montgomery's dismissal."

PRESIDENT ANXIOUS
TO END DISAGREEMENT
Holds Up Lusitania Proposals
Until He Hears Further
on Germany's New
Submarine Plan.
International News Service:
RHRLIN. Feb. 17. (Via. Am
sterdam) At the moment when it
was supposed that the Lusitania
question had been settled to the sat
isfaction of the United States, word
reached here today that the Amer
ican government had made new de
mands that would postpone a com
plete adjustment ami possibly pre
vent a settlement entirely.
Washington's new demands, said
messages that came heVe from Am
sterdam, related to the recent an
nouncement that armed merchant
men are hereafter to be regard d as
auxiliary cruisers and liable to at
tack without warnin?.
(lennan officials declined to com
ment on the reports forwarded from
Amsterdam, but they are anxiously
awaiting word from Ambassador
von P.ernstoriT.
f ntern.itirnnl News Service:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. Earn
est efforts to bring about a common
understanding- on submarine opera
tions by the Teutonic allies and on
what constitutes an nrmed mer
chantman by the allies so that a
common agreement that can be
subscribed to by all may he drafted
are being pressed by the United
Statf s. .....
Tres't Wilson realizes that the
Anstro-Olerman announcement of a
changed policy commencing March
1, coupled with the refusal of the
entente allies to agree voluntarily to
disarm their merchant ships, has
brought about a new situation
fraught with extreme danger to the
United States. In consequences Col.
E. M. House and the president are
in direct communication by cable.
The former is in London to get the
American viewpoint understood by
the Rritish and French foreign of
fices. And the president. In order that
his hands shall not be tied through
any embarrassing precedent, has
held up final approval of the Lusi
tania agreement submitted yester
day by Count von Rernstorff until
Germany and Austria shall define
specifically how they intend to con
duct their campaigns against armed
vessels.
I'-iser I "or Settlement.
Pres't Wilson is very eager that
an agreement be reached that will
I prevent any further complications.
He admittedly is gravely i-oncerned
over the decision of the entente
powers to stand squarely on their
rights under the existing law to arm
merchantmen "for defense."
If the allies refuse to make anv
j concessions whatever. then the
I United States must decide exactly
what "armed for defense" means.
Tt may rule reducing the calibre of
the gun that may be carried and
' provide that it sh;l! be mounted only
! in a certain way.
j At present the calibre is "up to
! six inches" and the gun "shall be
, mounted astern." Most of the guns
are of five-inch calibre and are
J erected astern on swivels which
make it possible for them to be
j used in any direction. Naval ofTic-
I loir. 1, . - ..irrr,.t..l . 1 It 1.,
im ii.iw rusiMt w vuai, n me i mm
to carry puns is to be recognized
this government should reduce the
size of the calibre allowable to two
inches.

International News Service:
NRW YORK. Feb. 17. every
where that anarchist sympathizers
held forth in the squalid tenements
of the east side or in the better res
idence sections of the west side
police today sought the trail of Jean
Crones, the Chicago anarchist, ac
cused of having put poison in the
soup fed to more than 200 persons

ceipt of a letter believed to have

in this city.
In the missive the writer declared
that he is living in a little town near
New York, but the police believe
that if Crones is in the east he is
making his headquarters in this city
and it was due to this belief that
the dragnet was thrown out in an
archist haunts today.
If the tra' of the fugitive is found
the detective ; hunting him will uso
extreme cant on in attempting an
arrest, as . the letter states Crones
took from. Chicago dangerous ex
plosives, a blast from which would
have "terible resultes."
Crones in the letter regrets that
his plans for killing many persons
at the banquet given Archbishop
Mundelein failed.
"I am sorry." he says, "that not
all or at least a 100 ot killed for
the world will be more happy with
out them."
He also expresses his contempt for
the police who are hunting him, re
ferring to them as "dead ones."
