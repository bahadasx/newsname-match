The greatest educational event
in the county during the past
week was the get-together day
at Woodland when the Bank of
Woodland Pig Club was organiz-
' ed. We have known Mr. Bays
, for years, and have always
found him full of good deeds and
ready to respond to every call,
but .we believe that this is the
greatest vision that he has yet
had. Forty-one Pig Club boys
with a registered pig, purchased
by this man, together with three
. prizes amounting to $50.00 to
, encourage their fathers to give
the boys an opportunity, means
forty-one bank customers who
will have something to deposit,
forty-one registered hogs to take
the place of sorry ones, forty-one
boys who will have better things
to keep them on the farm than
the town can offer, and every
person in beat 5 will teel one
common interest regardless 'of
town and country lines.
Mr. Banker and Mr. Business
Man. this is your opportunity to
secure and hold the buisness
man of the future as a customer,
Lend money to the boy to buy a
pig, or give him seed corn, se
lected and purchased by our
county demonstrator, or both,
with a contract that he is to de
posit his profits in your bank,
and you have helped to make a
man that will perpetuate . your
business interests.Lend money
fahd give prizes to the Tomato
Club and Poultry Club Girls and
they will know that you are in
terested in them.
Mr. Sanders or Mr. Cobb will
be glad to help organize these
clubs. The work at Woodland
by Mr. Sanders showed that he
. thorougnly understood his work.

The Flag Salute in Schools
Have' the pupil3 march in with
j a teauer iiuiuuig a nag.- uei
them take their places on the
l stage; then the leader with the
flag steps out in front of them
1 4 1,1 j: a t -j.
v and holds it aloft while they re
V peat the pledge,
y : The effectiveness of the Flag
C. Salute depends upon the spirit
v in which' it is given; and this
spirit depends, as all school exer
cises do, upon the spirit of the
teacher. If this is done in the
spirit of true patriotism, it will
beget in the hearts of the pupils
a love for the "Stars and Stripes"
and all they, symbolize.
The pledge is as follows:
"1 give try nextd and my heart to
jj God and my. Country-One Country,
jOc Language, One Flag"
! Alter the Lolor-bearer has
JJss brought fourth the flag, at a
s.gnai irom tne teacher every
pupil will stand erect in his phce
and give the pledge, and salute
in thi3 manner:
1 Extend the right arm and
point toward the flag.
2 Bring the tips of the fingers
to the torehead, saying, 1 give
my head,"
3 Bring the hand over the
heart saying, "And my heart, "
4 Raise the hand, point and
look upward, and say, "To
God,-"
5 Drop the hand to the side,
repeating, "And my Country, "
6 Standing erect, repeat,
"One Country, One Language,
One Flag." '
7 When saying, "One Flag,"
advance the right foot, bend the
body slightly forward, extend
the arm and point to the Flag.
8 Lowering the hand to the
side, all sing a stanza of "Amer
"ica or some other patriotic song.

Calomel Today,
Sick Tomorrow
Dose of nasty calomel makes you
' sick and you lose a
day's work
Colome! salivHlesl It's mercury.
Calomel acis like dynamite on a slufl-
gish liver. When calomel comes into
contact w i i li sour bile it crashes into,
it, causing cramping and nausea.
i f ii y i i .
If you feel bilious, headachy, con
stipated and all knocked out, just go
to your druggist and get a 50 cent
bottle of Dodson's Liver Tone, which
a harmless vegetable substitute tor
i i ii i r
dangerous calomel. Take a spoonful
nd if it dosen't start your liver and
straighten you up better and quicker
than nasty calomel and without mak
ing you sick, you just go back and
get your money. N '
If you take calomel today you'll be
be sick and nauseated tomorrow; be
sides, it may salivate you, while if you
take Dodson's Liver Tone you will
wake up feeling great, full of ambition
and ready tor work or' play. It's
harmless, pleasant and safe to give to
children; they like it." adv.1';
