METHODIST
Sunday was a good day with us
all around. There were over 250
in S. S. and a good size congrega
tion out for the morning worship. I
think borne of you were surprised
at tbe theme, but I told you it
would make you think, and the
farther we go into it, the more in
teresting it will be. This is not a
dream of a Turk, or imagination of
a few fanatics.
A word to tbe S. S. workers, re
member that we are not tbro. Our
progress has been wonderful; we
have as many in S. S- as we have
on the church register, that menus
over 300, but the work is not over
nor is tbe consecration pledge out
We took it for four months and here
is a lot of work that must be done
yet, for I am one do not believe
in a brush heap campaign. What
are numbers without persons. Yet
there are people in this world who
think if they have a certain report
they have won the battle, but this
is not true.
Next Sunday at 10:45 Dr. Paul
Linn will preach for us and all who
would like to hear him. He is not
coming in behalf of the school, but
to meet his old friends and preach
for them. Now you know Paul
Linn. He left a $6000 pulpit to be
President of Central College, and he
did a work there no other one man
ever did for any school. At night
we will have two places we can at
tend for the night service. Bro.
J Hale is a great preacher, and I am
glad be came to us. The other man
has the same reprutation, and there
is no reason why both of them
should not have a great crowd to
preach to Sunday night. I am a
great stickler for a pledge, sad I
want to say for my church, that I
will not hold an evening service at
long as one of the churches of
Monroe is in s revival. As I un
derstand it this is the agreement
among tbe churches, there will be
no evening services at long as a
