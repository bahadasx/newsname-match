PAPER MILL IS NOW
MAKING SHIPMENTS'
Several ('arloads Have
Been Shipped And 260
Men Very Busy
While everything is not perfect
at the gigai.tic mill of the Louisiana
Fibre Board Co., paper is being made
and already several carloads of
their product have been shipped and
it is expected that within a very
short time that the little troubles,
which are certain to arise for the
first few days, will be overcome and
then the mill be run at its full
capacity when from one to two cars
of container board will be shipped
each day.
The plant at present is giving
employment to over 250 men andf
one cannot realize the magnitude
and the investment that is repre
sented at this mill. The process,
that is required to make container
board from the waste of the Great
Southern plant is a story which we
hope to "cover" at an early date.

-M. E. Church will hold a' cake sale

NEXT WEEK WILL BE KNOWN
AS NATIONAL PAY UP WEEK
It had its origin in a little Iowa town, has spread over the entire
country. The week of February 21-26, has been set as the time.
The amount of money which is due in any town, if taken in the
total is surprisingly large.
Careful men of good judgement estimate that there is more than
$100,000 due in Bogalusa in small open accounts. Yet Bogalusa
people probably owe less than most towns of a like population and
business.
Now if all of us would start out with enthusiasm and determina
tion to pay up our little scattered debts, we would clean up the most
of them.
This would mean a big lot of money paid out in one week and
it would set the wheels of prosperity rolling for us all.
PAY UP NEXT WEEK
When one pays, another can pay and so on down the line and it
is astonishing what one dollar bill can do when once started. Pros
perity is starting, it is coming our way; let's give it a boost along by
one merry whirl of paying bills for one solid week.
CREDIT GREATEST ASSET
Credit is often highly desirable and of great benefit; it is bene
ficial to the men who gets it and it is beneficial to the mau who
grants it, since if the debt is paid, he has gained business. But the
debt must be paid if all' are benefitted. A man's credit is often his
greatest asset.
Credit is often abused. Not because the man who receives the
credit intends to abuse it, but because he neglects it. That hurts all.
Even the man who pays cash suffers if there is a material number
who fail to pay, because the cash man must meet the losses caused
by the man who fails to pay.
PAY UP WEEK
had its origin in Waukon, Iowa. The principal of the school there
was also secretary of the Commercial club. He suggested the idea.
It was taken up by the entire public, advertised extensively; the
business people joined in the movement and in that little town of
2.000 people, $50,000 indebtedness was wiped out in one week. The
greatest prosperity ever known there followed as a direct result.
CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING MATCH
TO BE HELD IN BOGALUSA SOON
Bogalusa sports are going to have
an opportunity to witness a cham
pionship wrestling match when J. K.
Curter, who holds the Lord Lons
dale Welterweight belt of the World,
meets L. E. (Lum) William. The
match is scheduled for Sunday
afternoon, February 27th, and will
be held at the Magic City Theatre
starting at 3.30. It is stated that
300 people from Magnolia, Tyler
town, Hammond, Columbia and
other nearby towns will witness the
event. There is no disputing the!
fact that Curter is the welter
weight chanpion of the World for
he posesses the belt with the en
graving to show when and from
whom it was won. This belt which
is valued at $500 will be on display
at Tom Chesterman's jewelery- es
tablishment, which is located in the
Lear Drug Store in North Bogalusa.
In case Williams defeats Curter he
will win the belt as well as a. side
bet of $400. Curter is a native of
Kentwood but has been in all parts
of the country defending his title
for the past several years. Boga'lu
sa fans saw him in action here

he won over Young Beall at Chica
,go.

OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE ORDINANCE
AND PROPERTY MUST BE KEPT CLEAN
The City is about to enforce very
rigidly the ordinances in reference
cleanliness and good order, and
this is notice to the merchants of
the city that hereafter the ordinan
ces in regard to throwing waste
paper and other refuse into the
the streets will be enforced
and that the entire premises both
in front of their stores and in the
rear will have to be kept clean.
It is reported that some mer
chants are throwing waste paper
WHAT IS THAT PECULIAR ODOR? EXPENSIVE'
What is it, that peculiar odor that
became so noticable Wednesday ?
Not so offensive at that is it ? Its
one of those smells that makes
strangers realize that Bogalusa is
some manufacturing city. This
particular new odor is the re
two falls in one hour or lose the
side bet of $400 as well as the belt
and championship. Williams is a
clever boy and will give me one of
the best battles of my life. However,
I am confident that I will do the
wirk in the specified time" said
Curter.
Williams is well known to a ma
jority of local men who follow the
game. They state that while he has
won ever contest into which he has
entered in this city that he has
never yet been forced to exert him
self. "I know that I am going up
against what is considered the best
man of his weight in the world"
said Williams "and I think that the
championship will come to Bogalu
sa. I have ever reason in the
world to believe I can defeat Curter
but it is going to require a hard
battle. I have several advantages
over the champion that will best be
shown when we meet,"
.Both men will go into training on
Monday and between shows at the
Magic City Theatre will wrestle six
men each evening.
The preliminary at the contest
here on Sunday Feb. 27 will be be

and Albert Thompson of McComb

the first meeting of the Commis
sion Council in March there will be
an ordinances introduced to stop
