CACHE COONTY
ASSESSOR STILL
EXPLAINING
It Is not my purposo nor deslro to
go Into nny lengthy nor continued
newspaper controversy, but I desire
that Iho' taxpayers of Cache county
shall know my position 1" n few
points wherein 1 feel myself mlsrcp
rcfientod.
In Iho llrst p'neo l deny that I
lmvo suggested n compromise with
anyoiu on tho basin of $17G per ncrc-i
I again repeat that 1 was threatened
with suit on my bonds, if I did not
rntso tho valuation of lands In Cacho
county nbovo that which I hnd nl
rendy decided would bo a fair cash
vnluattou.
I also repeat that Mr. Bailey claim
od that tho host lands In Cacho
county ought to be placed nt $2.0 per
tic 10.
In tho matter of my claim that tho
power plant In Blacksmith Pork enn
yon una assessed by tho Stato Ilo.ird
of Equalization In 1011, nt 07,521,
nro Iho figures ns they camo to us
from tho board and so placed on our
tax rolls,
In conclusion, I wish to say that
1 shall do my utmost to placo a fair
and equal ensh valtio upon nil prop
oi ty In tho county, so far ns my
Judgment will permit nnd In so do
ing shall allow neither fear nor fa
vor to swervo mo In my duty.

TO THE TAX
PAYERS OF
CACHE COUNTY
Inasmuch ns I nm accused In an
nrtlclo In our local papers of Febru
ary C, ns well ns from other sourcon
of taking a strong stand In favor of
raising taxeB In Cacho county, I will
hero stato that I am In favor or liv
ing up to tho law nnd by so doing,
Justice will bo meted out to nil allko.
I am In favor of assessing nil prop
erty of any name or naturo nt a fair
cash market valuo, at which It would
readily chango hands at any t I mo
whether It bo tho best grndo of land
or tho poorest Brado, tho humble
homo or tho palaco, a business or
livestock or nny othor kind of aBses
slblo property, I am In favor of as
sessing at a cash valuation and a
lower lovy rather than a partial val
uation, or (more or Icbs, n guess) anj
n higher lovy.
Thero will have to bo a certain
amount of raonoy raised by taxation
this year as last, to defray tho ex
penses of tho county ns a wholo nnd
tho peoplo havo tho nssuranco of the
county commissioners that thero will
not bo any moro monoy raised this
year than last, that amount being
considered sufficient to meet all do
mands and wo feel that If a Just and
oqual assessment can bo mado, many,
will bo relloved nnd othors Pay a
Just tax which according to tho rec
ords thoy havo not dono In tho past.
Today somo aro taking a stand
ngalnst a Just assessment according
to law, who havo not stood their por
tion of the burden of tnxatlon be
foro and who now aro afraid that
thoy wll havo to.
Respectfully jours,
E. J. BELL,
County Commissioner.
