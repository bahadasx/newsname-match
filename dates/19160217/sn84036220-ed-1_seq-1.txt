Admiral Grant Tells House Committee
There Is Only One Nation Strong
Enough to Land on Our Shores.
WASHINGTON, Fob. 16.—Commit
too bills to increase tiie regular army
to between 160,000 and 200,000 men
and proposing a definite scheme for
federalization of tbe national guard
under a militia pay act, probably will
be before both bouses of congress
within three weeks. A building pro
gram for the navy, however, will not
be ready before May, although Chair
man Padgett of tbe bouse committee,
urged tbe members today to speed up
examination of witnesses.
Tbe house military committee will
begin work tonight on Hie military
federalization bill, and if a strong
meusure is produced, influential mem
bers of tiie senate committee say it
will be accepted by the senate. Tbe
senate committee continued work to
day on its bill for the regular army
increase. It is understood a number
of items, such as provisions for bet
ter manning of tbe coast defenses, up
on which there is no disagreement,
have been written into the new bill,
leaving only tbe points on which there
is difference of opinion to be worked
out. Maj. General Carter, retired, and
officers from tiie war college of the
army, are aiding in drafting tiie meas
ure.
Tiie house ways and means commit
tee, to which will be alloted tiie task
of finding money to meet increased
military and naval expenditures, lias
taken no steps as yet. The increases
needed have not been estimated and
it is said tiie committee will not at
tempt to lay a plan for financing tiie
expenditures until these estimates are
forthcoming.
It now is understood that leadership
in tbe preparedness fight in the house
will rest with the two committee chair
men, Representative Hay of tiie mill
iarv committee, and Representative
Padgett of the naval committee. There I
lias been some talk Mince Speaker
Ciark lias come out strongly for pre
paredness that lie would engineer tile
whole matter. It was stated positive
ly tonight, however, that while
speaker's aid was counted upon, the !
committee chiefs would lead their own
forces.
Tiie naval committee struggled
again today witli the problem of sub
marines. Rear Admiral Grant out
lined further his plan to establish
submarine shore bases along the
coasts and repeated his statement that
183 underwater boats with 30 reserve
craft were needed. He said American
submarine builders, public and private,
could produce 48 of the 800-ton boats
he recommended, within 12 mouths.
Representative Callaway questioned
the admiral as to the relative strength
of the American navy among those of
tiie world. Admiral Grant said he be
lieved the German, as well as tiie Brit
ish navy, was considerably stronger.
"There is today." he said, "one pow
er that has enough navy to land oh
our coast, even if we had tiie 183
submarines and our present fleet."
"And only one?" Interjected Repre
sentative Kelly.
"I think only one," agreed Admiral
Grant.
"And you think it would not be nec
essary to build a navy as large as
that power?" asked Representative
Callaway.
The admiral assented and to Repre
sent ative Callaway's demand to know
why lie thought so. said:
"The relations between the coun
tries are pretty close. My personal
impression is there never will he a
war between this country and tiie
power I have in mind."
Admiral Grant declared any enemy
fleet must he considerably larger than
u defending fleet to force a landing.
"We played that very problem on
tiie game hoard this summer at tiie
war college, and 1 was beaten," lie
said. "The enemy landed. This fleet
was larger than ours and heavier. We
lost because he had battle cruisers
which destroyed our scouts and left
us without information."
Every maneuver or hoard game the
department had worked out. Admiral
Grunt said, hud shown tiie need of
battle cruisers and scouting craft. It
was for that reason, lie added, that
wliile lie believed tiie dreaduuught to
be the basic fighting unit of any fleet,
attention had been concentrated on
building battle cruisers and scout
ships, in addition to submarines be
fore more battleships were authorized.
Representative Callaway sought to
show that tiie battleship was a useless
lenient of a fleet in water where sub- I
murines lurked, but the witness did
not agree. In recent target practice
witli submarines, the admiral said, it
had been found very difficult to sight
the target through tiie periscope at !
a greater distance than a mile. The
periscope of a submarine was clearly
visible at two miles to lookouts aloft [
on the battleship, he declared, and
it was not any great task to hit it
with gun fire. [
experiments with aeroplaues to da- |
teet submarines wliile submerged had
shown disappointing results, Admiral
Grant said, because at a greater depth ,
than 20 feet aircraft could not follow 1
tiie movements of the submerged boat, !
except under most favorable weather I
conditions. ,
Aduiirul Grant thought Great Brit*
ain, France and Germany now hud
more than 100 submarines eaeli in ,
commission as against 37 in tiie Uni* 1
Hil States navy. Russia and Italy
also had added to their flotilla, lie
said, and bad big building programs,

ANOTHER TALKS
MRS. CHRISTENSEN TELLS OF
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE NEAR
TRAGEDY AT LEHIGH.
EXPECTS TO GIVE BONDS TODAY
Mrs. Minnie Christensen, who lias
deeply with her in her trouble.
Mrs. Christensen is a woman of !
prepossing appeurance and fine|
personality. In speaking of her case,
a uoll Ple '>• (lavs alter she shot Mrs.
Kirkpatrick at the hotel in Lehigh a
H b°rt time ago, expects to lie released
today on bonds. Tile recovery of Mrs.
Kirkpatrick now being assured, Mrs.
Christensen stands charged with as
sault in the first degree and Judge
Roy Ayers has fixed her bonds al
$2,500, which she is preparing to Cur
thejnish.
This case lias, of course, attracted
heen clnfined in the county ail since I
, . . .
a great deal of attention and smee
sht 1 lias been in the county jail Mrs.
Christensen has been visited by many j
Lewistown women who sympathize
j
she displays an earnestness that car
ries conviction with everything she
says. Tiie general facts regarding the
near tragedy ure pretty well known
by this time, hut the actual details
have not before been printed. Briefly,
Mrs. Christensen left her homestead
near Plentywood for Lehigh, where her
husband was employed as an elec
trician, about tiie first of the year.
An entire stranger In that part of the
country, she received some vague in
timations after she reached Windham
and immediately on arriving at Le
high, of intimacy between her husband
and Mrs. Kirkpatrick, employed as a
waitress al the hotel. She had not
been at tiie hotel many hours when
all this was to some extent confirmed,
in the days and weeks following this
fact caused litr a great deal of worry
ami sorrow and led to many unpleas
ant experiences, in which Mrs. Kirk
patrick scoffed al her. All this cul
minated in the suit filed Hie morning
of tiie shooting hv Mr. Christensen,
in which he asked for a divorce on
the ground of cruelty.
Mrs. Christensen had arranged to
leave tile lintel and come to Lewis
town that day, hut a girl employed at
the place and who hud been friendly
witli Iter, asked her to see about some
pay due her and which remained un
settled when this girl left. Mrs. Mat
son, the proprietor, was not in the
place that day and Mrs. Kirkpatrick :
lmd this matter in hand. Mrs. Chris
tensen hud packed her things and was |
leaving the hotel to get an express j
wagon to take them down. As she
stepped from her room on the ground
Moor, it I'huneed that Mrs. Kirkpatrick
stepped from Iter room, directly op
posite, the hallway being only about
three feet wide. Mrs. Christensen
took up this matter of the girl's pay
when, as she relates, the other woman
made a leap at tier und struck her a
heavy blow on t he left eye. She hail
in her hand a large bunch of keys and
one of these cut a gasli over tiie eye,
from which the blood spurted. The

LAND CONTEST DROUGHT HERE
DISMISSED BECAUSE OF REGU
LATION IN FORCE.
THREE NEW CONTESTS ARE FILER
Because of the regulations fnvnrnhh
to Hit* interests of minor heirs of
homesteader, in force in the United
States land department, a new contest
filed in Hie local U. K. landofllce Tiles-]
day did not get much of a start. In
fact it was ordered dismissed right off
the bat by the local officials, in tliii
ease George I). Armstrong of Glen
dale filed an action against Hie heirs
of George II. Butty, deceased, lie ul
legetl that the two minor heirs had
not made any improvements on the
land and that they hail abandoned
same. The filing was made in April,
HH5. Tiie contest was rejected be
cause llu* minors have two years' time
in which to dispose of the land, or
rather the guardiun of the minors can
do this for them. Proof can lie made
without the expenditure of a dollar on
the land and no residence is required.
The contestant also claimed Ihat no
cultivation had been done since Hie
filing was made. Tlx* tract is located
n .
The section referring to Hie rights
of the widow or minor children
such eases Will prove of interest,
follows:
If a homestead eiitrynmn dies witli
out having submitted final proof, his
rights under the entry pass to his wid
ow, or, if there he none, then to liis
heirs or devisees. However, if all the
heirs lie minor children of the entry
mail or entry woman, and their other
parent be dead, the entry is not „ub
jeet to devise. In such a case the
right to a patent vests in the children
at once upon proof only of the death
of both parents and that they are the
cnlv children of tile homesteader, pro
vided. as to a male homesteader, that
hern he no widow. The law provides,
in the alternative, that tiie executor,
administrator, or guardian may, with
in two years after the death of Hie
surviving parent, sell the land for tlx*
benefit of the children, in accordance!
witii Hit* law of Ihe state where they
are domiciled. In such cases it is.re
quired that there l»* furnished record
evidence of an order for ihe sale
>''ade by a court of competent juris
diction. In any event, publication and
nesting of notice of intention to submit
uroof or to ask issuance of
the purchaser -is required.

CONTEST CASE.
Roy Shearer of Hasconi has filed a
contest case in the local United States
land office against Edward G. Jack
son. alleging failure to reside on. cul
tivate or improve homestead in 6-9-30.
Erzerum is calculated to have lm
in.....use strategic importance in the
Russian campaign in Hie Caucasus.
And il will Indirectly affect the Ilal
kail campaign by relieving tlx* pres
sure on the allies al Kalolilkl.
The conviction entertained by all
Russian military observers that Erzu
rum ulllniutely would he forced to
capitulate was based on Hie fuet that
the remaining nine forts were of con
siderably less Importance than those
already In Russian hands and could ho
readily flunked or even Ignored, in
forcing tlx* evacuation of the Turkish
stronghold.
The Inking of the drat fort Is be
lieved to have destroyed tlx* plan of
(Ici'oiisc, since the Impregnability of
Ei'/crmii rented on the lotHUuiptlon of
the Herman engineers who construct
ed the forttflentloiis, that the position
was sale ugalnut assault from thu
south.
In spite of the IntoiiHO cold and deep
snow, tlx* Russian troops took Kop
mountain by storm and dealt thu
Turks tlx* first staggering blow. Huv
Dig driven them from this position,
the lliisslan artillery broke through
and Hanked tlx* other positions, which
went like a house of curds, the result
of ihe Russian onslaught exceeding
all expectations.
The Caueusion campaign derived
great benefit from llu* liiiaslan domin
ation of tlx* Black sea, which enabled
Ihe army to receive a splentiful sup
ply of provisions and munitions. The
number of men garrisoning (lie Turk
ish position before the recent retreat
of the Turkish army was estimated
at 80,000.
ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
Erzenim, Turkey's chief city in Ar
menia, Is in ihe Imixls of tile Russians.
Heavy assaults by the Russians along
(lie long line of detached forts pro
tecting the city, lusting over a period
of live days, and described by Grand
Duke Nicholas, the Russian command
In-ehief, a h unprecedent, have remitt
ed in the rapture of the fortress. Un
official reports early in the present,
month said the German field mar
shal. Von Her Goltz, witli 80,000 men,
were besieged In that city witli pro
visions for only a fortnight. The cap
ture of Erzerum is considered of great

Over those to the southeast and soutli
it will lie possible for the Russians
now to light their way toward their

sians und Turks in Northwest uud
West Persia, or proceed soutli toward
Bagdad In the relief of tlx* British bot

The immediate effect of the Rus
sian victory on the situation In Persia
and Mesopotamia is problematical,
however, for despite tile roads, the
country is mountainous and there Is
much ground to be covered—Home
lliing over 200 miles, before the Lake
Crum lull district of Persia is readied,
und over 600 miles before a Junction
with the British at Kut-Ei-Amura could
he formed.
With the advent of Hlormy weather
on the western buttle line tiie heavy
fighting of the lust few (lays seeming
ly lias simmered down uguin to artil
lery bombardments and milling oper
ations. Beilin reports, however, that
the British and French have endeav
ored to reeaptuke trench positions tak
en from them by the Germans, respec
tively, southeast of Ypres and In tbe
Champagne, neur Taliure, but that the
attacks failed. Purls asserts, on the
contrary, that neur Tuliure the French
have retaken portions of their former
reiielies.
The British und Germans are still
jut deadly grips for possession of the
] trendies cuptured from tiie British
1 southeast of Ypres, artillery and hand
grenades being employed in the flght
j ing. London reports tliut in the at
,OII1 Durdiiieiit, interspersed with in

yards of a front line trench, the Ger
mans at tucked over a front of 4,000
yards lint were everywhere repulsed
witli considerable losses, except at the
point the trencli was captured.
On tiie Russian front a driving suow
st.orm along the entire line has al
most stopped operations. The usual
fantry attacks, continue on the Aus
tro-Itallun line.
In Albania the Austrians and Bul
garians are said to have formed a
juncture and are battling of the cap
ture of the important seaport of Du
razzo, which is being defended by
Essad Pasha's forces, comprising Al
banians, Serbians and Montenegrins.
Tiie question of submarine warfare
still remains un open one by reason
of Germany's announced intention to
treat as warshipa aU arined merchant
men after Ft *b. 29. Secretary of State
Lansing is making a careful study of
Germany's latest reply with reference
to the Lusitania question to ascertain
if there is anything in the German
memorandum concerning armed mer
chantmen which conflicts with the as
surances given by Germany in the
Lusitania negotiations regarding the
sinking of liners and the safety of
their passengers.
