POUND DEAD
With the upper portion of his
body submerged in a barrel of
water, Henry Bowers, wealthy
Fargo contractor of the firm of
Bowers brothers, was found dead
in his barn, corner Second aven
ue and Third street north, about
9 o'clock last evening by his cou
sin Dan Billmeyer, who stays at
th'e Bowers home, 211 Roberts
street.
Bowers left his home about
8:15 o'colck last evening. Because
of his queer actions since an op
eration for the removal of a can
cer on the lip last Saturday, mem
bers of the family became alarmed
when he did not return within a
half hour, and a search resulted.
At the barn a distance of about
five blocks east of the residence
the body was found. Police were
notified and two officers went to
the scene. The body was then ta
ken to the undertaking establish

It was stated By his brothers
last night that He"nry Bowers wor

NAVAL SIGNALING.
it B«flan in Aneiwit Days by Raising
and Lowering 8aila.
The origin of the Idea of using flags
by day and lanterns by night for sig
naling in the navy came into being
as far back as the middle ages.
In those ancient days some one
thought out a method of raising and
lowering sails, the number of times
they were raised or lowered Indicating
the letter that was to be sent That
proved very wearisome work and was
superseded In the seventeenth century
by Hie use of balls and cones hoisted
In various positions on the masts and
booms. At night different colored lan
terns were used.
In the following century twelve flags
were used, either singly or In combina
tion, and these flags supplied an the
signaling that was necessary In fight
ing. as "Make all sail," "Engage the
enemy," "Chase the enemy" or "An
chor."
When the battle of Trafalgar was
fooght the signals were sent by light,
guns and flares and flags, and It WM
not till after that battle that the sys
tem, invented by Sir Home Popham,
was used and ,on which are based the
present day methods of signaling.
The system of signaling from ship to
ship by semaphore was due to
a
Frenchman named Cbappe in 1704 and
adopted In the British navy
a
years later.—London Telegraph.

SHRAPNEL SHELLS.
Various Types In Use and the Mass of
Bullets They Carry.
Most nations are agreed that the
three inch shrapnel is the most effec
tive for killing men In modern war
fare. The three Inch type, wblch Is
almost universally used, contains from
210 to 380 half Inch lead bullets,
bunched together in the front part of
the shell. A time fuse, which is made
with the accuracy of a watch. Is grad
uated In seconds and is set to explode
at a given VSflge as determined by the
artillerymen.
The velocity of the shell may be
gathered from the fact tbat it travels
a mile In four seconds and within a
quarter of a minute is four miles from
the mouth of the gun. At any time
during this rapid fligbt the shell can
be made to explode with marvelous
precision and deadly effectiveness,
driving Its bullets in a cone shaped
shower down on the beads of the
enemy.
A remarkable fact regarding these
shells is tbat the velocity of the bul
lets when the shell explodes exceeds
the velocity of the shell at the time
of the explosion by from 200 to 800
feet per second, the bullets of a burst
ing shell covering
a
sone about thirty
yards wide and 290 yards long.
Shrapnel shells used by different
governments at the present time all
operate on the same principle, but dif
fer somewhat as to size and the ar
rangements of the fuse.—Pearson's
Weekly.
It Is a great step in the interpreta
tion of life when we have discovered
that all events are ultimately spirit
ual.—Brierley.

Testing an Explosive.
One of the most dangerous of explo
sives Is iodide of nitrogen, a black pow
der which the slightest touch will
often cause to explode when dry with
great violence. In experiments to de
termine the cause of its extreme ex
plosiveness some damp iodide of uitro
gen was rubbed on the strings of a
bass viol. It is known that the strings
of such an instrument will vibrate
when those of a similar instrnmeut
having an equal tension are played
upon. In this case, after the explosive
had become thoroughly dry upon the
strings, another bass viol was brought
near and the strings sounded. At a
certain note the iodide of nitrogen on
the prepared Instrument exploded. It
was found that the explosion occurred
only when a rate of vibration of sixty
a second was communicated to the
prepared strings. Vibration of the O
atrlng caused an explosion, while tbat
of the string had no effect

Mr. Wilson's declaration was

that candidates for delegates from

that no presidential

SCIENCE WINS
FROM ELLENDALE
In a Somewhat Listless Game but
the Solenoe Pulled Through
With A
FINAL SCORE OF 26 TO 21
And a Large Orowd Was Preeent
and the Band Rendered Sev
eral Selections
(l'he Science basketball team
won in a hard earned victory over
EUendale at the S. S. S. gymnas
ium Tuesday evening by winning
.. out 26 to 21. Something seemed
candidate the matter with the Science team
ant) the boys just simply couldn't
get going in their usual style, but
at times showed their old timd
form by smothering their oppon
ents with rapid passing and team
work.
Sexvrey made the first basket of
the game and his work throughout
brought cheer after cheer from
the rooters present, who with
teir fog horn voices macte the old
hall fairly ring at times. Anderson
at center put up a dandy good
game and his rapid work and
strength kept his opponenes guess
ing at all stages.
in the first part of the game
Ellenale started out like a winner
making the score stand 6 to 2 and
then Science started creeping up
behind) them, and passed them be
fore the first half was over and
the score stood 14 to 9 at the end
I he first period of play.
The second half saw Science al
ways in the lead and although El
iendale got within a few points of
Scieuce sh enever crowded tho
boys too hard for comfort. Two
strings hanging from the ceiliug
near the north end basket caused
the EUendale team to put in a pro
test, saying that it bothered their
shooting and time was called, un
til their wishes were satisfied, but
we guess something else must
have been wrong.
The final half ended' with the
score 26 to 21 and again Science
has proven that she is superior to
any school in her class, although
defeats have been sustained, they
were with schools far out of their
class, and even at that they made
Ihem go some.
After the game dancing by the
students was indulged in until
shortly after eleven when they
dispersed for the evening after
having an enjoyable lime.
Besides the game one of the en
joyable features is the Science
band and its exhiliraling music
is enjoyed by all attending these
games, besides purling the proper
lighting spirit into the home play-

Mr. Crary, in a letter to all pub

plan. In orf!l?r to get a charter, the
company must have at least $200.
pledges are now being obtained.
Only $2,000 will be taken on each

maximum.
There already are several mu

lumber dealers, laundry men, etc.
It is suggested by the press as
