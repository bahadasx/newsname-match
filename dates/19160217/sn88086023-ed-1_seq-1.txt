Hereafter no person carrying or

any public place, public gathering or
place open to the public. An amend-j
mem to the prohibition ordinance,
making the above provisions, wad
passed by the council last evening
with an emergency clause attached 8
that it would go into erfect at once.
The original ordinance simply pro
hibtted the carrying of liquor into a
public gathering and this language
proved a snag to the city officials the
very first time an arrest was made
under the prohibition ordinance. A
young man was charged' with carry
ing liquor into a local pool hall and
was arrested when he offered a spec
ial officer a drink However, the of
ficials were not certain that a poo.'
hall could be construed as a "public
gathering," hence the amendment
which will eliminate such doubt In
