HIPPODROME ARTISTS BOOKED
For Knights of Columbus Minstrels
Next Wednesday Evening.
It is with great pride that the
management of the Knights of Colum
bus Minstrel entertainment announce
I that they have Just secured the ser
vices of Mademoiselle Patricia Dunn
and Frauline Wilhelmina McCarthy
the celebrated Irish reel and jig danc
ers from the New York Hippodrome,
who have been dancing to crowded
houses in that theatre for the past six
months.
But for the fact that these ladies
were childhood school mates of Grand
Knight Patrick Prendergast in the
Old Country, it would have been im
possible to secure their valuable ser
vices, as the management of the Hip
podrome were most reluctant to al
low them to come away for even one
night. Those who read the New
York papers have noted the glowing
accounts of these ladies ' In such
dances as "Pigeon on the Gate" reel,
"Paddy O'Rafferty" Jig, "Irish Lilt?
and "Turkey in the Straw" buck
dance, and many others, . and they
have promised to do them all for us.
Who would miss such an opportunity?
They will arrive in town Wednes
day morning and will be entertained
while here by Past State Deputy Dan
iel A. Guiltinan, who will drive them
about town during the afternoon In
the Tiona Oil auto and show them the
sights. Come and see them. They are
delicious.
In addition to the special dances
above mentioned. Mademoiselle Pa
tricia Dunn and Frauline Wilhelmina
McCarthy will dance an old fashion
ed Irish Square, with Joe McDermott
and Edward Cummings, to the chorus
of "Along the Rocky Road to Dublin"
following the singing of the verses by
Mr. McDermott.
If the encbores are sufficiently en
thusiastic to be distinguished from
the stage, M'lle. Patricia will escort
Ed. Cummings to the foot lights for
a good old 'break down Irish Jig. ,
i If the theatre is not already sold
out, secure a seat at once and give
these visiting ladies a good old rous
ing reception.

London, Feb. 16. Later official re
ports of Monday night's attack on the
British positions near Ypres .show
that the Germans' assaults extended
over a front of more than two miles,
and that their only success, the cap

was due to the explosion of five
mines. Artillery bombardments and
combats with band grenades are still
continuous in this 'region. .
The official communication Issued

Armenian Stronghold Taken By
Grand Duke Nicholas
ROAD TO BAGDAD NOW OPEN
Russians Will Be Able to Relieve
British Expedition Bottled Up at
- Kut-EI-Amara.
.London, Feb. 17. Between 30,000
and 100.000 Turkish troops and many
funs were caotured in the taking of
Erezrum by the Grand Duke Nicholas'
army, according to Petrograd dis
patches. Amsterdam, Feb. 17. Five thous
and Russians have been killed during
the fighting before Erezrum, accord
ing to dispatches from Constanti
nople. London, Feb. 17. Router's Petro
grad correspondent telegraphs that
Erzerum has been captured by the
Russians. Official announcement is
made at Petrograd tbat the Russians
have captured Erzerum. Grand Duke
Nicholas has. telegraphed the emper
or as follows: "God has granted the
brave troops of the army of (he Cau
casus such great help that Erzerum
has been taken after five days of un
precedented assault. I am inexpres
sibly happy to announce this victory
to your imperial majesty."
The capture of Erzerum has been
the objective of the recent campaign
of the Russians in the Caucasus. Its
possession is of considerable impor
tance, as it is the chief city of Turk
ish Armenia and the center of a sys
tem of roads. It has been understood
that the Turks had concentrated at
Erzerum an army of considerable
iael' Press 'dlspatcheS Worn Petro
grad' Te6ently said 'that' tjie .German
field marshal, Baron von' der Golts,
Vs' m 'bmrnand1 there '; jilVii 80,000
menv' that fheir escape had .been cut
qff. '.and that they' had provisions, for
only a- fortnight.'1 A relief expedition
was sent by the Turks, but it was re
ported those forces had been defeated
V the Russians with heavy losses. .
i Erzerum' 'is 60 miles' west, of the
Russian border.' It has belonged to
Turkey for four centuries and has
played a prominent part in previous
wars. The capture of Erzerum if ac
complished as reported represents
one of the few definite accomplish
ments of the Caucasian campaign. In
the first year of the war the Russians
sent an army into the Caucasus and
won tome success, including an im
portant victory at Sari Kamyah, but
the inauguration of the Austro-Ger-man
offensive in Galicia and Russia
put an end for the time for further ac
tive efforts in this Held.

Blocks Settlement of Submarine
Controversy With Germany
LITEST NOTE SATISFACTORY
Administration Insists that It Must
Have Guarantee that Neutrals
Will Be Protected.
Washington, Feb. 17. Great Brit
ain must Instruct the commanders of
her merchantmen not to fire upon
submarines before Germany will
rescind her instructions to submarine
commanders to sink armed merchant
ships, it is learned, is the position of
the Berlin government, following a
short conference today between Sec
retary Lansing and Ambassador Bern
storfl. Washington, Feb. 17. The subma
rine controversy with Germany can
not be closed until the United States
has fully considered the possible ef
fect of the declared intention of the
Germanic powers to sink all armed
merchant ships of their enemies with
out warning after February 29. This
announcement was made by Secre
tary Lansing yesterday, instead of the
long-expected announcement of a
satisfactory settlement of the Lusi
tanla negotiations..
Perfected . by months of patient
and at times perilous negotiation,
the Lusitania agreement was present
ed yesterday by Count von Bernstorff,
the German embassador, in a form
which would have 'been acceptable to
the United States, had not the Ger
manic powers .announced their deter
mination to . regard armed merchant
ships of their enemies as warships.,
The Lusitania agreement now will
not be accepted as finally satisfactory
o the t'hited States , until; President,
Wilson , an4. Secretary , Lansing hye
abided, whether ;any( of,,,11itsV terms'
btM riu!lljled'by' the. principles oj
8i'e''.'heV submarine campaign . .-..j.-
It ''is virtually',' certain, .that.; the.
TJnited States 'will, ask to be specific;
ally Informed1 that' . the . , assurances
previously given for the safety of .neu
trals'1 and non-combatants at sea havq
not been and will not . be altered by
the latest' declarations of the Berlin
and Vienna admiralties.
American officials fear that the
United States and Germany may find
themselves at the same point where
they stood in the first days of the
submarine crisis, with the United
States contending unreservedly for

; "THE SENTIMENTAL,, LACY"
Kleliie-Edlson Feature . at
Harte
"'"' Theatre Today.
1 The- story told in "The Sentimental
Lady" with Irene Fenwick In the fea
ture role, strikes a smashing blow at
the too often accepted theory that
"every man has , his. price." Bob
Nelson, a young attorney who averts
financial and matrimonial disaster to
"The Sentimental Lady" Is a striking
example of the fearless, sturdy and
strenuous Young American of today
as he upholds a lawyer's best tradi
tions. True, he has to virtually kid
nap a girl, with whom he next finds
himself marooned on an island and he
is compelled to risk life in a daring,
dangerous, but heroic battle with the
waters as he swims or aid for his
self-chosen client, but he rises to each
occasion in true spirit.
Patrons of Harte theatre have a
treat in store for them when this stir
ring photo drama is presented as the
special feature today. ' ' ' ,. '
"The Sentimental 4Lad" "is"..' a
Klelne-Edlson master feature, a fact
in itself attesting to Its merit. It is
