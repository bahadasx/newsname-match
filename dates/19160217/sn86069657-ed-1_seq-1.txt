CdarMTltie Found
John Meadows returned to
town Tuesday after a prospecting
trip iti the upper end of the
county. Mr. Meadows brought
with him 6ome excellent samples
of cannel coal which he found in
the neighborhood o f Rogers
Chapel, on the land of Prof., John
A. Rogers. The vein of coal is
four feet thick uud extends over
an arex of about six miles. At
present tho nearest railroad sta
tin i) is at Filson, 'ibout seven
miles from tlxycoal, but it is ex
pected that development of the
initio will start soon and that the
railroad will be built to the sup.
ply. ,
Mr. Meadows has had considerable-
experience in coal opera
tions, and he says this is ono of
tho finest showings ho has ever
seen.

For Road Bonds
On Monday, April 10, a vote will bo
taken in Powell county to determine
whether or not bonds to the extent of
140,000X0 will ba issued by tho county
for the purpose of building pikes.
At present the outlook for a Dig ma
jority for the bonds is excellent and
apparently everybody is for betttr
roads, and we have been unable to And
single man who opposes them. The
question comes up for discussion many
times a day on the street, in stores, or
wherever a few men congregate, and
all have a good wordlfor tho pikes.
Following are some of the arguments
we have heerd in favor of .the bond
issue: It. P. Wells is moving his mill
from Montgomery county to Spout
Spring and it will take threo dajs for
the job, while if we had pikes pMr.
Wells says he could move in one day.
Frank Kennon, who travels all ovor
the county selling Ilawlcigh's Prod
ucts, says he could cover three times
as muck ground on pikes as he can on
our present .roads' and would bo easier
on his stock at the same time.
John Mize took a load of tobacco to
the Winchester market a couple of
weeks ego and tho cost of the extra
teams he had to hire to get to the pike
would more- than pay his road tax for
three years.
It will cost J. M. Kennon five times
as much to deliver his crystallized I hue
at Clay City as it would if there was a
pike to haul over.
It takes every doctor in the county
three times as long to answer a rail as
it would if tho county was piked, and
this may often mean a difference be
tween, life and death, for one taken
jiMldonlJ!) v t . , ,. ,
These are only a few examples taken
at random and there are many more
who could give instances of the value
of pikes. The question is not what it
will cost to have pikes over the county
.but what it will cost TO DO WITH
OUT THEM, liink it over.

Wrong Initials
Last, week w e reported t h e
birth of a daughter to the wife of

been H. M. Curtis. The child is
a fine ten-pounder, and has been
named Gloria Mae.
-The Chairman of the Kcpubli-
can .National Committee at Chi
cago has
giveu out
ten reasons
why Wilson should not bo elect,
ed for a second term. - They will
havo to get nut ten more, and far
better one?, before it will have
much elToct on the voters, thohgli.
One cnuso for opposition to
Wilson is that he has not plung.
this country into war with MexU
co, causing the loss of hundreds
of lives in a fracas with a coun
try that knows no method of war
fare except guerrilla, and this
reason will not go far with those
who have tho good of the country
at heart and who have followed
the courso of the European war.
Everyone knows that had Knee
volt been at tho head of tho ua
tion during tho past two yours
the United Spates would have bo
come embroiled with Mexico and
in all liklihood would also have
had a hand in the worldwide war
in tho older countries. The re
sults of such a courso is plain.
Wo would have had Iosh of lives,
of property and business, instoad
of enjoyiug peace and ntosporify,
tt8 we are. at present.-
Accident at IS ad a
Wm. Ashley, a brakesman on
the Brodhead-Oarrett. log train
at. Nada, was seriously injured
Friday while oouphng cars on the

Mr. Ashley fell between the cars
and, owing to a curve in the road,
the engineer could not see him,
and he was dragged some dis
tance. A special train was call
ed, and he was rushed to Good
Samaritan Hospital, where it was
found that his right, leg was bro
ken in two places and the liga
tnents so badly torn that ampu
tation wns necessary, the opera
tion being performed Saturday
afternoon. Since then, we un
derstand his other foot has been
taken off.
At last, reports he was resting
well, and the chances for his re
covery were considered good.
He was accompanied to Lex
ington' by Ins wife and father,
Mr. Carl Hendricks, and Drs.
Knox and Johnson.
Mr. Ashley is well known in the
upper end of the county, and his
many friends hope for a quick
and complete recovery.

implements and machinery for a

Good Year For
Tobacco Men
Reports from art over the Blue
grass sretion indicate that the
acreage of tobacco in those coun
ties will bo greatly reduced this
year, and that hemp will replace
the weed in many places.
This opens a splendid opportu
nity for Powell couuty farmers,
as there is some very good tobac
co land in this county and with
the crop curtailed in Clark and
Fayette tho market should be ex
cellent. Tobacco is a crop that
requires considerable caro but
when a good crop is secured it
brings a good price. True, we
have some bad roads to contend
with in getting to market, but
with the pikes in prospect it will
relieve that condition to a great
extent.
