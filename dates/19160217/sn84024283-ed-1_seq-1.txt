Prince Albert
fits your taste!
Meets the fondest wishes of any man who
- likes to smoke because it has the right flavor

good you just feel
you never can get
enough. The pat
ented pr&cess
fixes that and
cuts out bite
and parch!
When you fire up your first
smoke you'll decide that you
never did taste tobacco that
hits your fancy like
the national joy smoke
For it exceeds in goodness and satisfaction the kindes
word we ever printed about it!
Men, we tell you this tobacco will be a revelation to you.
So, take this formation at 100, get out the old jimmy
pipe from its hiding place or locate the makin's papers
and fall-to!
Your wishes tolll be gratified at the nearest store that sells tobacco,
for Prince Albert is in universal demand. It can be bought all over
the states and all over the world! Toppy red bags, Set tidy red
tins, 10c; handsome pound and half-pound tin humidors and that
fine pound crystal-glass humidor with sponge-moistener top that
keeps the tobacco in such excellent trim.
R. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO., Winston-Salem, N. C.
In going to Valera, a little town 9
nine miles from here, yoa travel (or 6
miles through the Overall ranch, an
other tract something like 20,000
acres. There are numerous other im
mense bodies of ranch land, as .well
as fine farming -country, with fine
homes, but on the other hand there
are hundreds of renters housed : in
miserable buildings, with no barns or
out buildines. and living a hand-to-
mouth existence. i
On the whole the rural school build
ings are far above those of Southeast
Missouri, and the State appropriation
fund is doing much to bring the aver
age up. The buildings and the work
and attendance have to come up to I
certain requirements bpfore they can j
secure a certain amount from the State
for further improvements. The work j
which the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture
and the A. & M. College is doing, the
work in which Ethel is engaged, that
of teaching Home Economics in the
rural schools and communities, of
course is having its effect in raising
the standards of the country scnoois.
Ethel is attending a State meeting and
Short Course of Instruction of three
weeks duration at the College of In
dustrial Arts, Denton, Texas, All the
Agents are required to meet twice a
year for these short courses and meet-

I expect to stay nere tin aooui
February 10th and then go to San
Antonio for awhile. I expect to re
turn home about the let of March.
Mrs. Hale will stay here till May. Her
general health is much improved,
though the rneumatism is very pain
ful at times. I have felt much better
ever since I came. Ethel has excel
lent health here. In fact this seemB
to be a very healthful part of the state.
They had a severe epidemic of Grippe
for awhile, but that has aDout abated.
I am sorry to learn or me several
deaths at home, and very sorry too to
learn of the McColl-Uainpbell nre.
I lonk forward to the coming or the
Register as the "Letter from
Home."

yourself and family, and any other
friends who may maue inquires, i re

Mr. Hale in Texas.
(Written to. Mrs. Bynum.Belleview.)
Dear Mrs.. .Bynum Noting ; your
remark in the Belieview items I
I thought you might like to know
something about the - weather and
other conditions here at this time. In
the firsts place, the weather is about
as variable as it well can be, but
with all that has never been bo severe
as it is at home at the same time.
Last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
were sunshiny, warm as springtime.
I drove with Ethel about sixty miles
each day to different points in the
county to visit the schools. Found
the roads in good condition and every
where the four and six horse and
traction engine plows turning the
soil. They are putting the ground in
condition for cotton and in some
places are'planting spring oats. Win
ter oats are looking fine, though for a
a while it was thought they were
severely damaged by the cold snap of
' two weeks ago. They raise lots of
oats, and a great deal of Feterita,
Miln Maiza. and Kaffir Corn, but the
principal crop is still cotton. .There
is a great move- here to diversify
crops, and the . more progressive
farmers are turning their attention to
grain crops, but cotton has been King
too long to get away from it all at
once. There are numerous peach
orchards, and small fruits of all kinds
do well, but few. apples and those of
Inferior quality. They are raising
some Sudan grass, the most of the hay
here is the natural prairie grass. They
are fighting the Johnson grass here
as in most other sections of the state,
for it is an abominable plague. It
. makes gbqd feed if it can be kept in
subjection, but crowds out every other
. growth. , . "
Thursday a norther came up and
since it has been sleeting, raining, and
last nighfc thundered, lightened, and
hailed, which would be very unusual
for Missouri at this time of the year.
It Is now Monday, and the hailstonos
the size of cherries are ' thick on the
ground yet; the sun has not shone
out to melt them.
Coleman is a live town, the best in
this part of the State according td size.
The population, is about 4000. They
' have two ward schools and an up-
to-date high school with Manual
Training and Domestio Science equip
nient. All denominations are repre
sented hore, and the Methodists and
Baptist people are each just finishing
820,000 churches. The Presbyterians
. and Christian denominations are to
build equally good . houses Jn the
' snrinir. The town Is situated on the
main line of the Santa Ft) from Hous
ton to Frisoo, and on the short line
from Brownwood to San Angelo. The
Santa Fe people have just completed
a handsome depot built on the tint
form style of the 8. F, stations,
They have a good opera house, with
a continuous run of moving pictures
and a musical or thoatrical compnny
every two or tbreo weeks. "They also
- have a local Choral Club, and the dlf
ferent Women Clubs give amateur
plays often. They have a' splendid
Public Library here.
There are about as many business
houses as at Ironton, but there, are
two, dry goods houses larger than
Lopez Ct. They have two gins and
two oil mills which employ a large
number of men. In fact, these are
the only industries, in town as it is
wholly dependent upon its farming
community, A large number of the
residents are retired farmers and
ranch men. I visited what is said to
be the finest ranch home in the coun
ty one Sunday not long ago. About
7000 acres in the tract, and the house
fitted with electricity, heating system
running water, etc., as were the barns,
The owner-didn't know how many
cattle he had, but about 1500. He has
the finest . herd of 100 Registered
Hereford cows iu this section of the
State, from which he sells calves at
400 up, so you can guess at their value.
