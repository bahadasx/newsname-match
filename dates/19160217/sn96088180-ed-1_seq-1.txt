From 30,000 to 100,000
Prisoners, With Many Guns,
Fall Into the Hands of the
Grand Duke at Erzerura
London, Feb. 17. Between 80,.
OOO and 100,000 Turks, together with
many guns, foil Into Russian hands
when Grand Duke Nicholas' tones

menian city of Krzerum, said uuoltl

onslaughts of Nicholas men for dot.
ral days It estimated to havo been
100, OOu, while the modem fort
flanking the city mounted more than
1,000 gum.
There U nothing, however, to In
dicate how many escaped.
The fart that the city fell within
five day after storming operations
started makes it possible thnl the
captures were large. Moreover, the
ordinary exits from the city were few.
Then, too, the city was surrounded
and heavy snows made the highways
Impassable, so that it is believed that
thousands failed to escape.
. Inasmuch as many ot the captured
gun were modern Krupps, they may
prove to 'b of great value In further
Slav operations.
The city Is believed to have been
aflame when the Russians entered,
but whether ony of the jnoaques or
government buildings were saved Is
unknown.
Petrograd, Feb. II. Petrograd
nave Itself over to rejoicing today
and crowds In the streots made holi
day over tho fall of Erzerum before
Grand Duke Nicholas' forces. Flags
decorated houses and public, build
ings. In the dimly llghtod Kazan cathe
dral throngs chanted the To Deura,
while others massed outside in the
anow, prayed for the grand duke and
hailed him as the national hero.
Tho capture ot Erzorum, the first
Important Muscovite victory since the
Tetreat from the Carpathians, nearly
a year ago, stirred the city to new
patriotism, while the newspapers de
clared it the prelude to Russian clear
ing of. Russian Poland and Oaltcla
before summer.
Details of the capture are lacking,
though It Is reported that the Turks
are moving westward, abandoning
part of their artillery. This may
mean that most of the garrlBon es
caped front the beleaguered city dur
ing or after the Ave days' attack of
the grand duke's men.
Experts now believe that the Turks
must abandon their proposed cam-
palgn against Egypt, Inasmuch as the
British forces, soon to be heavily
reinforced, we only HO mllos from
Bagdad, whllo the Slavs are heading
westward through Armenia. With
these two forces thus near to form
ing a formidable alliance, It Is
thought the Turks will scarcely risk
a drive against the Sues canal.

STS ARE

Only word from Attorney General
Gregory is awaited, it Is understood.
before government officials make
raids on anarchist groups In San
Francisco, Chicago, New York and
Pittsburg, where plotters are report
ed to have arranged to terrorize offi
cials and damage federal buildings.
Evidence of this alleged plan ot
terrorism is said to have been pro
duced today In a conference between
United States District Attorney Clyne
and Justice' Department Agent
Cl&baugh from facts gleaned In con
nection with the alleged "poison ban
quet" plot of Jean Crones.
The national scope of the plot Is
admitted. Hatched in New York, the
conspiracy was financed by blackmail,
levied against financiers In many
parts of the country. Authorities be
lieve they can get further documen
tary evidence from the hands of at
least a dozen well known anarchist
leaders.
"With one swoop we can break up
the conspiracy," an official said, "and
we are now merely awaiting word
from Washington before going ahead.
Plans of government buildings in the
possession ot some ot Crones' asso
ciates gave us the first clue to the
situation and onr later discoveries
have borne out the original clue."
It is stated that the conspiracy
statute Invoked against the late Gen
eral Huerta would he used, along
with the Blackmail laws to punish the
alleged conspirators.
The presumably incendiary fire at
the city hall yesterday is regarded as
one phase of the situation.
