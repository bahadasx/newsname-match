UNDERWOOD TOASTMASTER
And Sustained His Reputation
as a Brilliant Master of
Ceremonies.
The open session of the Elk's
lodge Tuesday night, proved to be an
enjoyable affair.
At the regular session Mr. R. Lee
Cayce was decorated with the antlers,
the new ritual form being carried out
by the officers without a hitch.
On behalf of Past Exalted Ruler L.
H. Davis, C. R. Clark formally pre
sented to the lodge the memorial and
official tablets presented as a memo
rial to the late H. M. Dalton. The
memorial tablets have room for 160
names of members, only 34 names
now being on one of them. The offi
cial tablet in the opposite end of the
room has the names of 16 Past Exalt
ed Rulers, 8 former trustees and 17
present officers. Tablet supplies arc
provided for adding and changing
names. The memorial tdblets have
the names carved in them. The
names on the other are in raised gold
letters. Mr. (Jlark s speech was
a beautiful tribute to the deceased
members, to Mr. Dalton and to the
devoted brother whose love and
lovaltv prompted the generous dona
tion.
Speaking for the lodge, Judge J.
T. Hanbery accepted the gifts in an
address of touching appropriateness,
grace and beauty of diction. Judge
Hanbery is always a pleasing speak
er, and he was at his best.
The lodge then adjourned and the
members repaired to the dining
rooms, where Nick Stadelman and
Sam Ficken were found ready to
serve a bountiful meal of good things
to eat.
The banquet once disposed of, that
prince of toastmasters, Tom Under
wood, took charge and turned on a
flow of oratory that lasted until 11
o'clock.

MANY OF DEFENDERS KILLED
French Attempt to Regain Lost
Area in Champagne Are
Repulsed.
Switching their offensive from the?
Artois and Champagne regions in
France to the Belgian sector around
Ypres held by the British, the Ger
mans have smashed their way by an
artillery bombardment and mfantry
attacks into a British front line trench
over a distance of between 60Q. and
800 yards. Berlin gives the distance
as 800 yards and the British official
communication, in admitting the -gain,
asserts that it was on a front of about
600 yards. Berlin says that a major
ity of the defenders of the trench
were killed and that one officer and
several dozens of soldiers were taken:
prisoners.
In the Artois region between Lens
and Bethune the crater of a mine-
blown up by the Germans was oc
cupied by them, while the French
guns have been busy shelling German
organizations in the neighborhood of
the road to Lille. The French also
bombarded German positions north
of Vic-Sur-Aisne and to the northeast
of Soissons, and in the Argonne ex
ploded a mine and occupied the crater-
In Champagne, Berlin asserts,
French infantry attacks to regain lost
positions north of Tahure were re
pulsed, as likewise was a similar at
tack on the Vosges near Ober-SepL
The Italians are still using their
guns and infantry in attempts to re
take from the Austro-Hungarians the
positions recently captured on Monte
Rombon, but all attempts have been
repulsed with heavy losses, according:
to Vienna.
The Russians are still on the of
fensive against the Turks in the Cau
casus region, but Constantinople re
ports their attacks liave been halted
by counter attacks. In Mesopotamia,
the situation around Kutle-Amara and
