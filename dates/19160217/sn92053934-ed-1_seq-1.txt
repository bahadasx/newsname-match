NO NEED OF WORRY
OVER EXPLORERS
New York, Feb. 17. No fears need
be entertained for the safety of the re
lief expedition headed by Dr. Edmund
0. Hovey of the American Museum of
Natural History, which is wintering in
the Arctic regions, according to Knud
RasmuBsen, the Danish explorer. The
Hovey expedition was sent to Etah,
Greenland, with supplies for the Mac
Millan expedition, which went north in
a vain attempt to find the mysterious
(.'rocker Land which Rear Admiral

Etah and the relief ship George B. Clu
ett which returned to the United States
to obtain additional supplies, was un
able to proceed beyond Mestenholme
sound.
"While the Cluett may be crushed
in the ice," wrote Mr. Rasruussen un

fears for the crew, for if they run short
of provisions it will be eaBy to send
sledges to Uppernavlk for more."

"DRY" PETITION TAKEN
DAY BEFORE FILING
Danville, 111., Feb. 17. Local "dry"
circles here were greatly excited to
day when it became known that their
petition, containing more than 4,000
signatures, had been stolen from the
office of F. G. Duffin, a prominent at
torney and dry worker. Tomorrow
being the last day for filing the peti
tion, it is believed that the loss will
result in the abandonment of the wet
and dry contest this spring. The
"drvs." however called their organiza
tion into action and at once started out
workers in an effort to secure the re
nuired number of signatures before
the close of the filing limit, 5 o'clock
tomorrow evening.
The petition was stolen during a
short absence or Mr. Duffin from his
office at the noon hour.
There is no clue to the perpetrators
of the theft.

100,000 MEN
CAPTURED IN
TURKISH CITY
Official Organ of Russia Tells
Vast Army Taken in
Erzerum Victory.
GREAT FEAT OF WAR
Fall of Turk Stronghold Into
Allies' Hands Regarded
as Decisive.
Petrograd, Feb. 17 (via London, 2:15
p. m.) The official Messenger esti
mates the Turkish garrison at Erz
erum, capture of which was announc
ed yesterday, as 100,000 men. It also
estimated that more than 1,000 guns
were captured.
It is said there were 467 guns in the
outer forts, 374 in the central forts
and 200 field guns at Erzerum.
More than 1,000 guns were captured
by the Russians when they took Erz
erum, the Turkish stronghold in Ar
menia, according to estimates in a
Petrograd official publication. If these
figures are borne out, the Russian haul
in cannon probably sets a record for
the .war in the capture of any fort
ress. The Petrograd estimate places the
garrison of Erzerum at 100,000 men,
giving ground for an assumption that
the capture of this number of Turk
ish troops is claimed. Previous re
ports had indicated that the garrison
was bottled up in the fortress.
Vienna reports a defeat for the Ital
ians in the eighth attack by their out
posts" on the Austrian positions "at
Javerick, while before the new Aus
trian position in the Rombon district
the ground was covered with dead.
The current Turkish official state
ment gives no clue to the course of
events following the capture of Erze
rum and indeed does not record that
happening. The only mention of the
operations in this war 'area is the decla
ration that the Russians in the fight
ing of the three days preceding lost
5,000 dead and 60 prisoners. Unofficial
advices from Petrograd say the Turk
ish army is fleeing westward from Er
zerum through a difficult mountain re
gion. ',
Military observers In allied capitals,
who regard Erzerum as the key to
Asia Minor, expect the Russian success
to facilitate the capture of Trebizond,
on the Black sea coast to the north,
giving possession to the Turkish gate
way from Asia into Europe, while the
Turkish forces throughout Armenia
will be put in jeopardy, it is argued,
and the pressure on the British in
Mesopotamia will be relieved. Opera
tions on a large scale by the Russians
will now be possible for the forces of
Grand Duke Nicholas, it is declared.
Key to Asia Minor.
Paris, Feb. 17. The capture of the
great Turkish stronghold of Erzerum
by the Russians is declared by the
French newspapers this morning as
the best item of news for the allies
! in many months. The military experts
dwell on the importance of the cap
ture, declaring that it gives the Rus
sians the key to Asia Minor and is a
victory which will inevitably have far
reaching consequences.
General Berthaut In the Petit Jour
nal says it Is not only a deadly blow
to Turkey, but an event which cannot
fail to have its effect on the other
theatres of the war. Major De Civ
rieux says In the Matin:
"The conquest of Erzerum Is of more
Importance than would be that of any
other fortress in the whole war thea
tre. In Asia we are faced by a stra
tegic chessboard, ruled across by rail
roads and excellent routes along which
fresh forces could be brought up In a
few days. Erzerum was the solitary
bulwark of the Turkish empire in
Asia. Open spaces, suitable for oper
ations on a great scale, now present
themselves to the forces of Grand
Duke Nicholas of Russia."
Constantinople, Feb. 17, (via Lon
don, 12:33 p. m.) The losses of one
of the British expeditions in Mesopo
tamia in a battle with the Turks near
Batiha, west of Korea, amounted to
2,000 officers and men, according to
an official announcement given out by

GERMANY WILL BE
DEPENDENT UPON
AMERICAJSCLAIM
London, Feb. 17 (12:16 p. m.) An
Amsterdam dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph company says the manager
of one of the greatest German ship-
Jjdne-colni&nies, in an interview in the
Bremen Tageblatt, expresses a pessi
mistic opinion regarding the effects
of a possible breach of relations be
tween Germany and the United States.
This skipper, who, the dispatch says,
is believed to be Albert Ballin, direc
tor general of the Hamburg-American
Steamship company, is quoted as fol
lows : i
"A breach of Germany's relations
with America would have a most ser
ious effect. All America's money and
munitions would be at the disposal of
the entente allies. We should have to
take over the feeding of the Belgians,
and America's attitude probably would
induce other neutrals to attack us.
All our ships would finally be intern
ed in American ports. This would
represent taking away enormous
wealth from us.
"Our plight would be most difficult.
When the war is over Germany will
have to replenish her stocks of raw
materials. Do not let us entertain any
illusions with regard to England. She
will continue commercial warfare
long after military operations are
over. She will take away all our trade
with South Africa and Australia and
It will take'1-years for our passenger
service to reach a condition anything
like that which existed before the
war."
PROFITS GUT AS
BUSINESS BOOMS
New York, Feb. 17. Paper mills in
the United States are operating to ca
pacity and many of them are turning
away orders, but the increase in the
price of raw materials and the high
price of labor has reduced the profits
of the business, according to members
of the American Paper and Pulp as
sociation attending the annual con
vention here today.
Arthur C. Hastings, president of the
American Writing Paper company,
said the royal proclamation prohib
iting the importation of paper or raw
materials for It into England after
March 1, except under a board of trade
license, would not affect the American
manufacturers. He said he believed
England made this order In reprisal
against the action of Sweden in cut
ting off exports of wood pulp.

SOUTHERN FLOOD
STEADILY GROWS
MORE DANGEROUS
Natchez, Miss., Feb. 17. The head
waters of the flood pouring through
the levee break near Newellton, La.,
reached St. Joseph early today. En
gineers believer ttie entire Tensas basin
will be flooded by tomorrow night SL
Joseph is protected by a back levee and
is only partly inundated.
Several motor boats started from SL
Joseph today for Newellton to help re
move about three thousand negroes
from temporary refuge in mills and
cotton gins.
New Orleans, Feb. 17. Flood waters
from the crevasse in the Mississippi
river at Buck Ridge are near St.
Joseph. The water is runing south
ward after having filled lake Bruin,
seven miles below Newellton.
Hundreds of recruits have joined
rescuing parties and organized efforts
are being made to take the marooned
persons to places of safety. Scarcity
of boats makes this work difficult.
The food situation is expected to
present a serious problem at Newell
ton. There are several thousand negro
refugees housed in mills and cotton
gins around that town and few is any
brought more than enough food to
last through a day.
During the night the refugee camps
at Natchez and Vidalia gained many
members. The food situation at Nat
chez, owing to the arrival yesterday of
a steamer loaded with supplies, was
regarded as satisfactory for the pres
ent. So far three unidentified negroes are
the only victims of the high water.

rushing in. At Volendam 20 houses
have been abandoned. The railway
embankment between Purmerend and

LUSITANIA IS
YET IN STATE !
OFQUANDARY
Wilson and Lansing Consid-
ering Latest Proposal
j From Germany.
PROPOSAL ACCEPTABLE
Say Berlin Terms Are Now
Agreeable in Case As
surances Asked For.
Washington, Feb. 17 Secretary
Lansing today accepted the Lusi
tania agreement as acceptable to
the United States, insofar as it re
lates to that case, bnt asked Count
von Bernstorff, the German ambas
sador, for assurances that Ger
many will not carry its policy of
sinking merchant ships without
warning to liners, even If they car
ry armament.
The question of what constitutes
armament is to be determined on later
in a way not yet agreed upon. It la
suggested that the United States may
propose that guns mounted on the
stern of ships and capable of being
swung from 15 to 30 degrees in either
direction might come within that class.
Germany to Befnse Suggestion!
It was stated authoritatively that .
Germany, because of Its unusual posi
tion, cannot and will not accept the
suggestion of the United States as it
now stands that liners carrying arms
shall be immune from attack under
previous assurances.
Washington, Feb. JJ-Pretident v
Wilson and Secretaxr Lanstas -were ''
considering today the new German
proposal designed to settle the Lusl
tania controversy to determine wheth
er its terms would be nullified by the
announced intention of the Teutonic
powers to sink all armed enemy mer
chant ships without warning after
Feb. 29. ,
American officials expressed the
opinion that the submarine controver
sy with Germany cannot be closed un
til assurances are given that the safe
ty of neutrals and non-combatants at
sea have not been altered by the lat
est Germanic declarations. They fear
that the United States is confronted
with a long series of diplomatic ex
changes and state that the situation
is where it was several weeks ago,
when it was described as "grave."
Proposal "ot Comprehensive.
It was said that a close study of the
proposed Lusitania agreement may
disclose that it is not sufficiently com
prehensive to embody guarantees for
the future and that Germany may be
asked if she intends to sink ships
armed for defensive purposes only. In
Teutonic circles It was said that un
doubtedly Berlin would give such as
surances but would request informa
tion as to what the United States con
siders to be defensive armament.
Announcement of the delay In the
settlement of the submarine contro
versy was made by Secretary Lansing
and came in place of the long expect
ed announcement of a satisfactory con
clusion of the Lusitania negotiations.
The German communication had been
presented by Ambassador Bernstorff
in a form substantially acceptable to
the United States.
May Ask Time to Clear Situation.
It was said that Mr. Lansing asked
the ambassador if Germany intended
to abide by its promise not to sink un
resisting "liners" without warning
given in the Arabic case. Count Bern
storff is said to have replied that It
was his personal opinion Germany
would do so. He suggested the possi
bility of postponing the effective date
of the new submarine campaign to
give time for negotiations to clarify
the situation. Secretary Lansing, how
ever, was non-communicative.
