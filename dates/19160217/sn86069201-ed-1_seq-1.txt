INFORM THE HDITOR!
One of the most difficult of the edi
tor's jobs is to get facts about 'births.
marriages and deaths. I'eople seem to
think he ought to know these things by
intuition. If not that, the birth, mar
riuge or death is of such importance in
the immediate family that it ispresum
ed that the editi.r will be informed by
some such wireless or just grow into
the information. Then, when the
paper comes out und no mention is mude
of the event, the editor is blamed for
not running u good newmper or nut
getting all the news. Remember th-ie
are u good many people in this county.
If the editor Knew each of them by
name, besides their family bistoiy nnd
the chief events in the lives of every
individual, he wouldn't be an editor.
He'd be u demi-god, resting bis feet on
a cloud uud sipfiing umbrosia insteud of
iuhubiting an ollice chair and wondering
whet e the money for the next white
piper bill is coming from. We're
anxious for news for the paper, nnd it
won't put you out much to drop by the
ollice nnd notify us or telephone us
what s happening ut your house.

MAYOR DAVIDSON RESIGNS.
Hands In Resignation At Council Meeting
Last Monday Night.
No little surprise nnd regret was
created at the meeting of the city
council last Monday night when Mayor
Davidson handed ln,hts resignation to
be accepted at once. Without except
ion Mr. Davidson has made one of the
best Mayors the city of Lancaster has
ever had and his friends regret that he
lelt that such a step had to be taken.
He stated that his main reason for re
signing was that much of the duties of
the Police Judge was devolving Uion
him and the result was that It was
materially interfering with his private
business. It is to be hoped that things
may be adjusted so that these impor
tant duties may be lifted from the
shoulders of the Mayor and in such
case, there is a possibility that he may
be re-elected tonight at the adjourned
meeting of the council. The city can
ill airord to lose so valuable n man as
Mr. Davidson at its head and the Rec
ord hopes that adjustments can be
made and Mr. Davidson re-elected to
night. THE PEOPLE DEMAND A
GOOD ROAD SUPERVISOR.
GARRARD ROADS NEED INTELLIGENT
THOUGHT AND WORK.
The position of Road Engineer in this
county draws an annual salary cf One
Thousand Dollars ($1000.). The job
comes by uppointment and there are no
Incidental expenses, such as making a
race for the ordinary office, to secure
it. The pay equals to three and one
third dollars per day for three hundrej
working days. If any one doubts that
oar turnpikes need the three hundred
days service of a good energetic, prac
tical business man, let him ride over
the roads of the County. To those who
are making constant complaint and who
are every day reminded as they travel,
that our turnpikes are turning to mud
roads, let it be remembered that this
condition is brought about by neglect
and incompetent management since our
turnpikes have been free, and the blame
does not lie upon any single administra
tion. Hut the present administration
must meet the conditions at this time.
The failure of the past is just now be
ing developed and Judge Arnold is per
haps getting far more criticism than he
deserves. Rut there Is a remedy and
it Is up to him to take advantage of it.
The mistakes of the past must he cor
rected. The road engineer that he is
about to appoint should be a competent
man and suitable for the position. If
he fails in the selection he must bear
the responsibility. It is his duty to the
public to find and appoint a rilan who is
not only competent, but who has the
energy and determination to put the
roads in condition. This can not be
done by any man who expects to sit in
an office in Lancaster and talk politics
and discuss the issues of the day and
draw his per diem. It will take some
Intelligent work on the part of the road
engineer und his full time to make any
showing.
Froi.i the complaint we have heard
we do not believe the people of the
county will longer tolerate the neglect
in our road system and those who are
now in chorge would do well to under
stand the impatience along this line.
And" Judge Arnold ought to have this
in mind and what !i expected of him
when he names Mr. Uogie's successor.
PREACHINGS ANTIOCH.
Rev. Shock, of Lexington will preach
at the Antioch church next Sunday
morning. The public cordially invited.
