DRIVE AGAINST EGYP
Unofficial Reports Indicate Greater Part of Turkish Garrison
. of 100,000 Have Been Forced to Surrender-1,000
1 Guns, Many of Them Krapps, Captured British and
i Slay Forces May Now Unite and Drive Everything Be
fore Them Storms Put End to Fighting In West
London, Feb. 17. Between .10,000 and 100,000 Turks,
together with many guns, fell into Russian hands when
Grand Duke Nicholas' forces captured the important
Turkish Armenian city of Erzerum, said unofficial Petro
grad messages today.
The garrison that withstood the onslaughts of
Nicholas' men for several days, is estimated to have
been 100,000, while the modern forts flanking the city
mounted more than 1,000 guns. There is nothing, how
ever, to indicate how many escaped.
The fact that the city fell within five days after storm
ing operations started makes it possible that the captures
were large. Moreover, the ordinary exits from the city
were few. Then, too, the city was surrounded and heavy
snows made the highways impassable, so that it is be
lieved that thousands failed to escape.
Inasmuch as many of the captured guns were modern
Krupps, they may prove to be of great value in further
Slav operations.
The city is believed to have been aflame when the
Russians entered, but whether any of the Mosques or
government buildings were saved, is unknown.
I'ctrogind, Feb. 17. Petrognd gave
ilselr over to ropoicing today aud the
crowds in the streets made made holi
day over the fall of l-'.rzerum before
Grand Duke Nicholas' tones. Flag
decorated houses and public buildings.
Hymns of thanksgiving arose from
thousands of throats.
In the dimly lighted Kazan cathedril
throngs chanted the to ileum, w'.iile oth
ers massed outside in the snow, prayed
for tho grand duke and hailed him as
tin- national hero.
The capture of Erzerum, the first im
portant Muscovite victory since the re
treat from the Carpathians a year ago,
stirred the city to new patriotism, while
the newspapers declnred it the prelude
to liussinn clearing of Poland and Gal
icia before summer.
Details of the capture are lacking,
though it is reported that the Turks ire
moving westward, abandoning part of
their artillery. This may mean that
most of the garrison escaped from the
beleaguered citv during or after the
live days' attack of the duke's men.
Kxperts now believe that the Turks
jmist, abandon their proposed campaign
against Egypt, inasmuch as the Hritish
forces, soon to be heavily reinforced,
are only 110 miles from Bagdad, while
the Slavs are heading westward through
Armenia. With these two forces thus
near to forming a formidable alliance,
it is thought the Turks will scarcely
risk a drive against the Suez canal.

Amsterdam, Feb. 17. Five thousand
Russians were killed, and several thous

Insists War Can End Only
When Germany Agrees
to Allies Terms
By Ed L. Keen
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
New York, Feb. 17. "How lonir do
you think the war will last."
After the usual polite and more or
less perfunctory inquiries as to the
state of his health and what sort of
a trip he had, judging from the writer's
personal experience and observations
in the last few hours, this is the first
serious question fired at every Amer
ican returning from Europe by every
one he meets.
Anticipating some such inquisition,
and in order to guide him in forming
an opinion, the writer had asked the
same question of a lot of folk in Eng
land just before sailing on the Baltic
for New York. It received almost as
great a variety of replies as the num
ber of Britishers interrogated that is,
as to time. They ranged all the way
from six weeks to six vears.
But in their real essence all were
alike: "Until Germany gives up!''
was the unanimous verdict.
They're telling a good story now in
Loudon about the way premier Asqtt i,tli
is said to have answered this question
at a recent social gathering. British
cabinet membors have become so used
to parrying uncomfortable or puzzling
queries on the floor of the House of
Commons since the war began that they
often, unconsciously carry their parli
amentary armament into the drawing
room. A Definite Answer.
" How long do you think the war will
last, Mr. Asquith?" inquired a fellow
guest.
"I would have much preferred that
the honorable gentleman had given me
previous notice of this question," re
plied the prime minister in his most
unctious on-the-carpet tone, "but since
he insists upon an immediate and ex
plicit reply, I will say tnat the answer
is in the negative."
Although the head of the British
administration can't be persuaded to
hazard a time guess on the duration of
the war, both his public and his private
utterances on the subject in recent
weeks leave no doubt that he stands
with every other Britisher whose opin
ion is at "all worth considering, in the
manifestly sincere and honest belief
that the war will go on until Germany
agrees to peace on the terms of the
Allies.
Make no mistake about it, the Allies
are out to win. They were never so
determined or so united as they are to
day. That the recent "made in Germain-"
stories cf likihood of an early
separate peace with Russia, or France,
or England, are absolutely without
foundation I am firmly convinced, r.ven
in the event of the remote possibility
that one or more of the allies might
bo persuaded to enter into separate
peace negotiations with the Central
Powers, England would go right on
fighting.
English Have Learned.
It would be most difficult for any
one who has lived in the British at
mosphere since before the war started
and has watched the gradual alteration
of the English national spirit from
airy cocksureness through successive
stages of bewilderment, humiliation,
ami lesson-learning, into one of relent
less bull dog tenacity of purpose, to ar
rive, at any otner conclusion.
Despite alll the muddling of the past
eighteen months the military miscal
culations, the diplomatic blunders, the
political upheavels, the industrial tur
moils the average Britisher has not
onlv never despaired, he has never
hud anv real doubt as to tne outcome
of the struggle. The more recent mis
fortunesthe loss of Bulgaria, tne ob
literation of Serbia and Montenegro,
the failures in Oallipoli, and the trou
bles in Mesopotamia he has regarded
as mere episodes, unpleasant it is true,
but without anv effect except possibly
to retard the final triumph of the
allies.

New York, Feb. 17. Crones, wiw

SURVEYING PARTI
GIVES RISE 10 NEW
line Extends In Southeasterly
Direction From 0. E.
Depot
The sight of strange surveyors plant
ing stakes inside the city limits of Sa
lem yesterday and today has given rise
to numerous rumors of a new railroad.
Local railroad officials deny any def
inite knowledge of the proposed rail
road but the indications point to the
fact that it may be an extension of the
Oregon Electric lines. The two sur
veys start from the Oregon Electric
depot at the corner of High and State
streets according to the station num
bers on the stokes.
Ono survey extends down High street
from State street and follows the bnnli
of . South Mill creek around back of
Fry's hill, then cuts across the corner
of the Blind school lot and goes on
out through Bush's pasture. The oth
er lino extends up the creek across
Church street and reaches Bush's pas
ture on the east side of the blind
school.
The Mount 11 a has not -shown any
activity in the field for some time
which has given rise to the belief that
Mr. Mount was not backed by cither of
the two larger roads in this city and it
is believed that the Mount boom has
subsided.
In towns where proposed railroads
are frequent it is well known that it is
a far cry from the preliminary survey
to the tooting of the whistle of the first
train but Sniem has not been enlivened
by a real railroad rumor for some time
which probably accounts for the un

ABOUT HIMSELF
BILL FASSES SENATE
Washington, Feb. 16. The
senate today passed the New-
lands bill, as amended by Sen-
ator Borah, proposing an inves-
tigntion into the advisability of
government ownership of rail-
roads. Most of the piogressives
voted for the measure, although .
Senators Norris and Kenyon de-
nounced it as inadequate. Sor-
lis charged that it was a part of
a democratic plan to substitute
a prolonged investigation for
the cnmpaigii promise to regti-
late railroad securities.
Germany's Position on Armed
Merchantmen Prevents
Settlement
Washington, Feb. 17. Great Britain
must pledge that her liners will not
ihi upon German submarines, before
Germany will instruct her undersea
commanders not to attack armed mer
chantmen without warning.
This is Germany's counter proposal
in answer to America's objection to the
Teuton decree proposing such unwarned
attacks, it became known nfter a 20
minute informal conference today be
tween Ambassador Bernstorff and Sec
retary of State Lnirainif.
Germany and America, it was learned,
are agreed upon the I.usitnnia wetted
meat except that the United Stutes
considers further submarine questions,
as well as those of the past, must be
cared for. Lansing is understood to
have insisted upon adherence to the
previously proclaimed American stand
for the right of merchantmen to arm
for defensive purposes.
Bernstorff indicated that he must
ask his home government for instruc
tions before meeting American terms,
and he does not expect to see the sec
retary before next week.
The Austrian decree for attacks giv
en out' by the department today, are
similar to Germany's orders.
End Is Far Away.
Washington, Feb. 17. Further and
apparently intermit) able negotiations
over submarine warfare confronted the
United States government today with
the Lnsitania settlement blocked, tem
porarily at least, tho diplomatic situa
tion generally tangled.
The administration will not accept
the Lnsitania settlement, now in its
hands, until the effect of tiio Teuton
decree announcing its intention to at
tack armed merchantmen is determined.
Germany may postpone operations' of
this decree pending negotiations over it.
Ambassador Von Bernstorff was ex
pected today at tho state department,
to be told that written assurances are
wanted that the decree will not apply
to passenger liners armed for defen
sive purposes and that the government
does not dare to proceed with the Lus-
itaina settlement until Germany's
course toward merchantmen is unequiv
ocally defined.
German embassv officials professed
surprise at the postponement of the
Lnsitania case, and thought that this
might have a bad effect on German
public opinion. They were confident,
however, that Germany will willingly
give further assurances against attacks
upon passenger liners.
Meanwhile, the administration plans
to exert pressure upon the allies to in
duce them to comply with the American
general note Becking disarmament oi
