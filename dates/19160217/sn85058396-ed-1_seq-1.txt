ERZERUM THE KEY
TO ASIA MINOR
Capture of Great Turkish
Stronghold Victory for Rus
sians of Far-reaching
Consequences.
DEADLY BLOW TO TURKS
Loss of Solitary Bulwark of
Turkish Empire Leaves
Space for Big Russian
Operations.
Paris, Feb. 17, 5:05 a. m. The cap
ture of the great Turkish stronghold
of Erzerum by the Russians is de
clared by the French newspapers
this morning as the best item of news
for the allies in many months. The
military experts dwell upon the im
portance of the capture, declaring
that it gives the Russians the key
to Asia Minor and is a victory which
will inevitably have far reaching con
sequences. General Berthaut in the Petiti Jour
nal says it is not only a deadly blow
to Turkey, but an event which can
not fail to have its effect on the oth
er theatres of the war.
Major Cievrieux says in the Matin:
"The conquest of Erzerum is of
more Importance than would be that
of any other fortress in tho whole
war theatre. In Asia we are not
faced by a strategic chess board, rul
ed across by railroads and excellent
routes along which fresh forces could
ia hrnutrht un in a few days. Erzer
um was the solitary bulwark of the
Turkish empire in Asia. Open Bpaces,
Euitnble for operations on a great
scale, now present themselves to the
force's of Grand Duke Nicholas of
Russia." , , ,
President Poincare telegraphed
congratulations on tho capture of
Erzerum today to Emperor Nicholas
and Grand Duke Nicholas, comman
der of the Rubsian forces on the
Caucasian front.
Rejoicing In Russia.
Petrograd, Feb. 17, via London, 2:50
p m, public rejoicing over the cap
ture of Erzerum is reflected in the
newspaper comment on the fall of tho
fortress. The Novoo Vreraya consid
ers the capture to have enormous im
portance as it points out that Erze
rum as a center of road and railway
routes, has immensfe depots for am
munition and supplies.
The Rech says that tho capture of
Erzerum menaces all of Asia Minor
and even Constantinople.
Tho Bourse Gazette believes that
the capture will have an effect upon
Athens nnd Bucharest as well as upon
Persia and Afghanistan.

BOSTON LAWYERS
ATTACK BRANDESS
Supreme Bench Nominee Very
Capable, Very Energetic,
Not to Be Resisted, But
Unscrupulous.
WRECKED A RAILROAD
Massachusetts Investigates
Forcing of New England
Road Into Hands of Re
ceivers.
Washington. Feb. 17. Two promi
nent Boston attorneys Moorfield
Storey and Sherman Whipple were
among the witnesses called to testify
at today's hearing before tho senate
judiciary sub-committee regarding the
fitness of Louis D. BrandeSs to be a
member of the supremo court of the
United States.
Moorfield Storey of Boston, an at
torney, charged before the judiciary
sub-committee of the senate today
that Louis D. Brandeis helped to
wreck the New York and New Eng
land railroad in 1892 nnd 1S93 with
the result that It was absorbed by
the Now Haven road.
Asked as to Mr. Brandeis reputa
tion as a lawyer, Mr. Storey testi
fied: "I think his reputation in the Bos
ton bar is that ho is a very capable,
very energetic and If necessary to ad
vance his objects, he is not scrupul
ous as to his methods, nor is ho to be
resisted "
Employed to Wreck Railroad.
Storey had been summoned by the
committee in its Inquiry into the fit
ness of Mr. Brandeis for the supreme
courL Senator Walsh told the wit
ness that C W. Barron of Boston had
said Brandeis was once employed to
help wreck the New England rail
road "I think that Is true," said Mr.
Storey. Ho proceeded to describe the
New England as a competitor of the
New Haven between Boston and New
York.
"Shortly before the spring of 1892,"
he said, "the New Haven began to
harass the New England which ran
part way to New York over the New
Haven tracks The New Haven first
refused to advance freight for the
New England It seriously interfered ,
with Its trains and thore was even'
indication that it was the purpose of
the Now Haven road to destroy tho .
New England.
oiunueis rues buns.
"In the spring of 1892, Mr. Brandeis
brought a series of ten suits against
the Now England railroad in Massa
chusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Isl
and.. He was acting ostensibly for N
F Goldsmith, a Boston liquor dealer,
Jind small New England stockholders
against some associates. The bills
were designed to paralyze the finan
cial operations of tho New England
railroad. One suit was to prevent
the payment of dividends on preferred
stock; nnothor to prevent the issue
of mortgage bonds and another at
tacked tho New England's lenses on
certain branch lines.
Massachusetts Legislature Investigates
"In the following year tho Massa
chusetts legislature Investigated rela
tions of the New Haven & New Eng
land roads. I conducted tho hearing.
Mr. Brandeis testified there that ho
was counsel in all these suits which
Impaired tho finances of tho New
England road, forcing it into receiv
ers' hands In 1898 from which it
emerged as the property of the New
Haven.
"The suits, while brought In the
name of Goldsmith, wore really
brought in some othor interests. Gold
smith was unable to pay the expense
of the suits. It appeared that Judge
W. J. Kelly of New York, now on the
New York supreme court, was Inter
ested in tho case. When I asked Mr.
Brandeis If he made any charges to
Goldsmith and Ills' associates, he ad
mitted that he did not and said mon
ey was paid to him through Judge
Kelly.
"It was apparent that the suits
were not brought in the interest of
his ostensible clients. Brandeis took
directions from outside sources.
Names of those directly Interested
never were disclosed but the result
of the fight was that the New Haven
road eventually took over the prop
erty of Its competitor."
Mr Storey testified that at the
Masqachusetts legislature Investiga
tion of the relations of the New Ha
ven and the New England, Brandeis
refused to tell who were his clients
unless Storey agreed that the facts
uould not be used in the suits. Storey
said he could not consent.
"It Is apparent to me," said Storey,
"that it was clear to Mr. Brandeis
that the ostensible parties to the
suits were, not the real parties and
that he made his charges and took
orders from other parties who may
havo been persons or have been the
New Haven. The result was that the
New England was wrecked."
Storey Refuses to Answer.
Chairman Chilton wanted to know
what waB the specific complaint
against Mr. Brandeis. Mr. Storey re
sponded that he considered it uneth
ical for a lawyer to do anything the
truth of which would prejudice his
case in court.
Senator Chilton suggested that the
Incident took place some twenty
years ago, but Storey charged Bran
deis had done the same thing in the
more recent Ballinger-PInchot Investi
gation. "Mr Brandeis announced that he
was appearing for Mr. Glavis, whereas
he was paid by Collier's Weekly," de
clared Mr. Storey.
"How do you know by whom he
was paid?" asked Senator Walsh.
"Only by hearsay."
paid him?"
"lf he had announced he was em
ployed by a newspaper he would not
have been listened to as he was."
Senator Walsh inquired if the New
Haven might not be responsible for
the reputation given to Brandeis in
asmuch as the New Haven people
w ere socially prominent in the com
munity. The witness responded that
the reputation he had described had
arisen before Brandeis began his at
tack on the New Haven.
In cross-examination, Mr. Storey
was asked regarding the protest
against-'Mr. Bran Aels confirmation
signed by President Lowell of Har
vard and fifty-four Boston lawyers.
He brought out that there are from
three to five thousand lawyers in
metropolitan Boston.
Young Lawyers for Brandeis.
'Many young lawyers in Boston are
with Mr Brandeis and respect him."
said Storey, "but they are the young
lawyers who don't know him."
Regarding the Warren will case, in
which it was charged that Mr Bran
deis was guilty of unprofessional
conduct, Mr. Storey defended Mr.
Brandeis. He said it was common
practice for lawyers in such cases to
represent all members of a family
even if some of their Interests did
clash
Sherman Whipple Testifies.
Sherman L. Whipple, another Bos
ton attorney, concerned in the War
ren will case, In response to qucs
tlonr by George W. Anderson, repre
senting Mr. Brandeis, made this
statement:
Brandeis Able and Learned.
"As a lawyer Mr. Brandeis is able
and learned. As a man he is con
scientious and high minded. The
feature of his career which is most
striking and remarkable has been his
unselfish and unswerving devotion to
the social, moral and Industrial uplift
of the lowly and less fortunate of
our people. I believe that on the
supreme court bench of tho United
Stntes he will exert a strong influ
ence in establishing the ideals to
which he has been devoted in his re
cent years."
Coming, however, specifically to

moral aspects of Mr Brandeis' moral
aspects of Mr. Brandeis' action in the
Warren case Mr. Whipple made this
statement:
Warren Will Case.
'7 then claimed and am now con
vinced that the original transaction
involved a breach of trust in that it
gave Samuel Warren and perhapB an
other of the trustees an opportunity
to make a great deal more than other
wise would have been allowed as tms
ee fees and violated the principle
that the trustee shall not make per
bonal or private profit."
Mr. Whipple said he did not believe
Mr. Brandeis intentionally made tho
arrangement to give Warren a private
profit.

Washington, Feb. 17. Secretary ' "

The question of what constitutes de- J

It is suggested that the United States " jr
may propose that guns mounted on i
the stern of ships and capable of he- ; ;

It was stated authoritatively that
