rhomas F. Sloan, Esq., Passed Away
' : at Bis Borne oa Vest Lincoln Way
Yesterday Morning.
This community was greatly
shocked yesterday morning about
nine o'clock when the word was
passed around that Thomas F.
Sloan, Esq., one of this county's
most prominent citizens, had
passed away suddenly at his
home West Lincoln Way. The
News told of an accident that be
fell Mr. Sloan while descending
a telegraph pole on Sideling Hill
mountain on New Year's Day.
He was not considered seriously
hurt, and since that time he had
been in his home, up and about
the house most of the time, . and
until a day or two ago, his con
dition seemed to be steadily im
proving. Yesterday morning he
arose from his bed and went in
to the bathroom, where he had
. an attack of heart failure and
expired almost instantly.
Mr. Sloan was very widely
known among the officers, and
employees of the Western Union
Telegraph Company, he having
taken charge of the office in Mc-
Co wellsburg on the first day pf
September, 18C4, and served that
company in the capacity of oper
ator, and lineman continuously
for a period of 51 years and four
months. During the last 13 years,
he had charge of the testing sta
tion at the Mountain House on
Rays Hill, and never missed a
day from duty on account of sick
ness, and during that time he
was apparently in the best of
health. He had reached the time
when he would be honorably re
tired from service on half-pay
for the remainder of his Hfe.
In connection with his faithful
cervice to the Company, he found
time to read law, and in 1879, he
was admitted to the Fulton Coun
ty bar. As his reading had been
a matter of pastime, and the ac
quisition of the knowledge of law
for his own personal use, he nev
3r entered into active practice.
, In religion he was a devoted
Presbyterian, and for many years
i Ruling Elder jnt ..ACon-
; lellsburg Presbyterian church.
, Oa.the 22nd, day of . February,
1870, he was married tbMfss Jo
jephine Alexander, a sister of
:he late Senator W. Scott Alex
ander who- survives together
With the following children,'
namely, Alexander, Thomas
Franklin, Findlay Morse, James
Addison, Walter Reed, Miss Ma
ry Jane, and Miss Harriet Bar

,The funeral will be held Sat
urday afternoon and interment
will be made in Union cemetery.

iMoiwicnstanaing many years
have come between me and the
home of the News, as I view
those dear old hill3 and valleys
and their kindred associations
from the memory of boyhood
days, yet with all the new names
of the living, and the weekly
record of departing contempor-
aries, the News comes a welcome
weekly visitor to our distant
home, where the varied lullaby
of the grand old Pacific, as
breaks in thundrous fury, or in
gentle cadence on the shore

last daily "Good-night."
Many times I have been
prompted to write a little letter
to express my appreciation of the
many contributions from other
"Fultonites" scattered all over
the United States, and bevond,
and of the medium through which
we learn of each other. But
is so easy to defer such a matter
that I find days and years go by
without having acted., I am sure
brother Peck will understand the
sincere gratitude of each of us
for his services; and also that
each writer will feel that his or
her contribution is appreciated,
tho, may-be, not acknowledged

some of my impressions of this

unprecedented month of rains,
floods and resultant disasters. If
those of the News readers who,
during the past summer, or at
other times, viewed the rugged
Sierras as their peaks pierced the
fleecy clouds and stood out in
bold relief against the. blue sky
so serene and placid, could have
witnessed the. transpositions to
snow storms, thunder and light
ningsof cloud-bursts that , sent
floods and disaster into the semi
tropical.valleys below, they would
respect them more for their
mighty possibilities." Then, if
they could look upon them "some
of these beautiful mornings, from
amid ' the roses, geraniums and
orange blossoms, as their, serra
ted peaks, white as polished mar
ble, stand out far above the clouds
in the " brilliant sunlight, they
would witness the grandest .and
most magnificent sight that south
em California presents.
I was interested in the recent
letter from J. K. Stevens, . of
Kansas, on his trip through Cali

this Mr. Stevens is; perhaps John
Stevens of my boyhood acquaint

His observations an4 reflec

measure by yihych we. gauge, in
a very large degree, the relative
merits of other; places when con

wish it were 'an even greater
factor in' the lives of all our peo

BOILER EXPLOSION.
John A. Irwin Painfully Scalded Mon
day Afternoon When Boiler of His
Heating Plant Burst
Th,e home of Merchant John, A.
Irwin, of the "Irwin Store," is
equipped with a hot-water heat:
ing plant the boiler being in the
basement and the expansion tank
and outlet pipe on the third story
the pipe opening out on the
north side of the building. ' J
About 12:30 Monday afternoon,
Mr. Irwin went down to the
boiler and seeing that it. needed
some additional water, opened
the intake pipe. Soon after the
beginning of the injection of the
cold water, the boiler burst on
the side by which Mr. Irwin was
standing, and the 'escaping hot
water and steam scalded him
very severely from his chin to
his feet. Dr. Mosser was called
and rendered Mr. Irwin every at
tention possible under the cir
cumstances, and Mr. Irwin has
been resting "as comfortably as
might be expected. It is hoped
that the burns were not deep,
and that he will speedily recover
without any ill effects of the ac
cident.
It is believed that the blizzard
of Saturday night and Sunday,
which drove down from the north,
sealed the outlet r r pe, thus chang
ing the plant from a hot-water,
to one of steam.
Bcr 81st Anniversary.
Mrs. James A. Stewart, of
Green Hill, expects to celebrate
in a quiet way her 81st birthday
on Friday, the 18 th. Among the
guests to be present are her son,
William. N. Stewart of Trenton,
N. J., and her daughter, Mrs. L.
H. Wible, " of Harrisburg. Her
home the Green Hill House is
flit a
one or tne very lew remaining
road houses that were famous
among travelers between the
East and the West before the ad
vent of railroads, and it never
closed. Mrs. Stewart lived there
nearly all the years of her.life,
and has rived to see the "Old
Pike" rebuilt and rehabilitated
by' travel, and the old House' is
again frequently taxed . to over
flowing on many- summer days
and nights. We venture the as
sertion that no other landlady be
tween Philadelphia and Pittsburg
is so often remembered by her
guests who send her souvenirs
from all. interesting points in
North America. Mrs. Stewart
assists actively every day in the
duties of the household.

' Game Notes.
Secretary of Game Commission,
Joseph Kalbfus, addressed a
meeting of the local sportsmen's
associations at Bedford last week.
Bedford county is to receive a
liberal number of game birds and
animals for distribution this
spring. Fulton county, accord
ing to a letter to this office, is to
receive a small number of ring
neck pheasants in the spring.
We have been told that ten or
twelve years ago, a covey of tame
English pheasants were liberated
in the north-eastern part of this
county, and they soon fell a prey
to boys (big ones) who could
walk up to them and pot them as
easily as any old rheumatic roost
er on the farm could be shot.
The idea of preserving them un
til they become wild and multi
plied seems not to have been con
sidered. ihe Mexican quai
brought from the torrid zone to
be liberated in Pennsylvania to
freeze to death, happily all died
in Harrisburg before being set
free. Experience in every state
in the Union has shown that im
ported game birds are a rank
failure in the United States, in
eluding those brought from simi
lar climates. Local sportsmen
united a few weeks ago in a re
quest that several elk be liberated
in the Meadowgrounds and in the
Aughwick regions this spring.
but the applications were refused
by the Game Commission as not
practical on account of probable
damage suits that would be in
stituted by land owners. The
Secretary states that accumulat
ed claims now run into manv
thousands of dollars, and that
wild turkeys are included in the
nuisance class by some farmers,

We are at a loss how. to begin
our "notes" this week, ' for the
reason that the mass of 'splendid
data pertains to districts r organ
ized with some definite object in
view. It seems that things that
are worth while, things that
bring solid and lasting benefit
are being accomplished only
through, or by community work.
Here is a story pf a community
that is selling 400 pounds of but
ter every week in distant cities
at city retail prices. The butter
is sent directly to the consumers
by parcel post" That district
has a wide-awake agent of the
State- Experimenttation to work
up such matter&fflrthem. Brief
ly, the butter js al made by an
expert in a centrally located
creamery and it is real butter for
which the city eaters gladly pay
the price, for it. i never offends
those aristocratic noses. The
splendid workof boys and girls,
clubs that never "go to pieces"
would fill this page of the DaDer.
Granges that deserve the name,
conducted on sound business
principles, seem to be winning
wonderful results socially, finan
cially, and politically. They are
claiming the fatherhood of many,
of the recent laws that favor the
farmer. ' All this looks easy and
simple, but when we dig down
under the surface for reasons,
we invariably find that some
where in the "bunch" there is a
''gander" whose sole business it
is to lead in the interest cf his
people. He reverses the usual
order of too many isolated, tem
porary organizations by eliminat
ing the cause of failure, namely,
what s everybody's business is
nobody's business." Hundreds

' - .. License Courts.
Judge Gillan. last Friday, filed
a decree granting all the liquor
licenses applied for in Franklin
county with the exceolion of the
National Hotel at Greencastle.
which was the only one against
which there was a remonstrance.
Owing to the fact that ..Bedford .
county has a "dry" Court there
are no applications for license
this spring. The Adams 'county
license court came to a close last
Friday after a fight of almost
three weeks. The remonstrances
were, against the hotel at York
Springs, and two places,. in Get
tysburg. Judge McPherson has
set March 6th as the time for
handing down the decisions in all
of the cases. Jefferson countv
has been added to the "dry" list
of counties of this state. The
Judge recently refused all ap
plications for " licenses 44 in
number. Last year the county
had 43 licensed places.
