EXCITING
hp eces
OF BASKET BALL TEAM
"Whore nro wo going?"
"When will we get hack?"
"Do you think wo will win?"
The.se woro .some of the questions
the girls of the Tucumcari High School
basket hull team had Iseun unking for
two weeks or more. Ah it happened,
none of the unHWorx: "To Las Vegas
unil Santa Kc; Saturday night;" and
"yes;" wan true to fact. Hut the
live iluyr of our trip were too full of
excitement to cause much dissatisfae-
lion with results.
At six o'clock on the moraine; of ;
Thursday, February .'5, there were as
sembled, in addition to the girls and
their chaperon: Supt. Shadwick, Mr.
Lovelady. Roger Keeler, Lucius Shnff,
and two Ford cars. The players were
the Misses Hosie Tarpley (captain),
Madge Campbell, Rebecca Everest, Jn
sepmne notary, nossie r,mier, uons (
Whitmore and Maurine Steckman. i
The events of the tup included a j
view of the eclipse, a welcome stop j
for lunch, and a tramp up hill whore
the roads grew rugged. We reached
Las Vegas without accident, witness-
ed the parade by which tho high school
advertised tho games of the evening,'
and prepared for the contest. '
The scores of the games were a sur
prlso to many has Vegans as well as
to ourselves. Our defeats 18-9 in the
girls' game, and i(-ir in tho boys'
game may be attributed in part to
the effect of the high altitude upon
tho players' endurance, and to tho ab
sence of regulation goals. Our play
ers showed true Tucumcari spirit by
gritting their teeth nnd preparing for
the next game.
The boys left with their officials
for Raton early Friday morning. Tho
destination of the girls was Santa Fc
where a game was scheduled for that
night, but owing to heavy snows we
tlid not attempt tho Clorieta Pass.
Our search for a southern route be
rime almost j. arduous and extend
ed as that of Columbus I'm a sea route
to the Indies
Such vivid impressions of New Mex
ico's vast distances, inlinitu blue moun
tains and wonderful sky-lino were
etched upon our minds that day that
they still haunt our dreams. Hut not
all thots were those of poetry. Roger
watering his car for tho nth time,
declared in disgust that the next Fortl
he drove thru the desert should have
a camel attachment!
Two mnin stops were made one at
Anton Chico, the other at Palma. In
the afternoon we found the mud and
snow increased in our way. Another
distressing feature was the fact that
no matter how long wo rode, Santa
Fe was always sixty miles distant.
Minor repairs to the cars caused sev
eral delays in the process of which
the captain became so impatient that
she declared her intention of getting
out and walking. She was dissuaded
only by the cheerfulness of Rogers
characteristic Irish retort.
"All right, that will make tine moro
less!"
Several times we hail to push the
cars up a particularly muddy or snowy
rise, not suspecting that we were
merely getting in training for the
real work of Saturday. As night
came on we gave up hope of reaching
Santa Fe, ami at last a loose connec
tion forced us to abandon one car and
seek shelter in the nearest ranch
house. This was a spacious adobe struc
ture occupied by a well-to-do family
named Chavez. Nothing more hos
pitable than our treatment could be
imagined. After warming ourselves
by the cheerful stove wo proceeded to
spread out on tho long kitchen table
tho crackers, sardines and canned
fruit which the business munngcr had
thoughtfully procured at Palma
Flanked by "lache" and coffee, the !
meal seemed an epicurean banquet.
Our hosts hastened to find chairs
for us, hut Madge, called upon to ex- I
press in Spanish, the sentiments of
the company, assured them that we
would cat on ou, feet!
"Hurry und wash tho dishes, girls,"
suggested Mr. Shadwick. "I sot tho
water on to hent long ago."
Acting on this suggestion, the girls
rolled up their sleeves und Doris lift
ted the kettle. Tho peculiar brown
appearance of tho dishes soon con
vinced tho girls, however, that tho
superintentlents dishwater was mere
ly another kottleful of coffee.
To escape the resultant confusion,
that gentleman bad withdrawn to tho
other r.om to make arrangements for
payment. When asked whnt ho want
ed in return for his hospitality, our
genial host pointed at one of our stal
wart maidens, and Haiti cheerfully,
"Grnndo muchocha."
Unfortunntely the proposition did
not appeal to tho player In question,
but "Grnndy" became her nickname
at onco, and that is tho cause of it.
The tliscovory of a phonograph in
the next room put tho weary tourists
on tho qin vivo at onco. Tired, de
feated, antl disappointetl as they
might have considered themselves,
there was only one way in which to
treat this adventure, and that was to
xnako a "lark" out of It. Tho sug
gestion of music led ouo of tho young:
men of the house to produce a fiddle,
while hiH brother played a French
harp. Soon the girlB were lightly
tripping away their cares across the
neatly-rcruhhed pine floor of the'
Chavez living-room.
Our baggage and wrapn had been
I piled in the corner behind the stov,
j where n hearty fire still blazed in n
j friendly faHhiou. AcrosH tho room
stood two bedH, and between them, on
the table which held the lamp, net our
violinist, mute of English speech but
eloquent of rhythm and melody. The
rest of the family sat on the beds,
watching us silently with curious, but
friendly eyes. We seemed to bo a
troop of invaders in the calm dignity
of an atmosphere redolent of the New
Mexico of fifty years ago.
At the witching hour of cight-thir
ty the girls retired to a room in which
woro enshrined the Holy Family nnd
a gallery of sainUi. Hiawatha stood
on guard over one bed, so that wo
felt thoroly blest by both Christian
and pagan divinities.
Daylight revealed the most roman
tic dooryard in New Mexico. From
the side or the house the ground
sloped in a steep, rock incline to a
deep canyon. The water was frozen
like a skating rink, nnd covered with
a iKht fall of snow. Beyond, rose
loftier crags and taller pine trees.
The ranch was un oasis in u desert of
solitude.
Wo hnd half expected Mexican
dishes for breakfast, but our meal
proved to be genuinely American. An
unlimited supply of stenk, eggs, po
tatoes, biscuits, and coffee, appeared
from time to time, and almost as mi
raculously disappeared. We strug
gled to say our "Tcnemos sufficiente,"
ami finally left the table in order to
avoid foundering.
As we bade them farewell, our host
tried to keep one of the forwards
as a souvenir, no doubt. Hut she
managed to escape, and we resumed
our journey with no casualties.
Our main objective on Saturday was
Lamy, and we knew we must eventu
ally come to a main highway before
we could reach that town. Our search
for the official road led us thru deep
snow, antl our experiences crystallized
in the parody on " 'Tis Love that
makes the world go round," which
we sang along the way:
" 'Tis girls that push the Fords up
hill Thru drifts of snow knee-deep.
We put our shoulders to the wheel
When weaker souls would weep.
When roatls urc bad, and gas runs low
We keep on pushing still,
For 'tis girls, girls, girls that push
The Fords up-hill."
The men of the party always did
the hardest work, of course, but no
one escaped doing his or her share.
When we finally reached the high
way imagine our disappointment at
learning from a stray traveler that
the route to Larny was impassable
on account of the snow. Wo were ad
viscd to push on to Moriarity tho
nearest town. There remained no
other course to follow, so we pro
ceeded thru the snow and mud.
About two o'clock wo came within
sight of a shcop-hordor'.s camp. By
tramping about a mile the men se
cured some beans antl biscuits from
an absent host, but no information.
When we hnd resumed our journey for
over an hour, wu were glad to bo con
firmed at a ranch-house in our hope
that this was the right direction. The
roads grewbotter, and wo sped over
the miles until at last wo caught sight
of tho town of Morarity. It might
l have been one of the magic cities of
Cibola, judging from the cries of joy
with which it was greeted.
Mr. Loveliulv eruellv increased our

bono steak smothered in onions. It
was now five o'clock and wc hnd eaten
nothing since breakfast.
When wu arrived at the town our
first question was.
"Whon does the first train leave for
Santa Fo?"
The answer wns:
"Next Tuesday."
This, bo it known, was the New
Mexico Central. Naturally we aban
doned hope of ror.hing Santa Fc that
night, for one of the cars needed ox
tensivo repairs and thero was no oth
or way of reaching our destination.
A long-distance call to Santa Fo pro
duced the information that another
game could not be scheduled for a
tlato earlier than tho following Fri
day. Nothing remained for us hut
to return to Tucumcari.
Ono hope remained benfsteak,
While supper was being prepared,
tho girls spied a piano in tho hotel
partor. Soon tho air rang with tho
song, "Thoro is a high school 1.! cur
town," "Horo'H to our lassies," "It's
a long way to Tucumcari," nnd othor
high school songs. Ono of tho regu
lnr boarders, standing out in tho hall,
remarked:
"Those girls seem to huve Tucum
cari on tho brain."
"Yes," his companion confessed,
and I'm beginning to hnvo Tucumcari
on tho brain, too."
After a decidedly welcome meal,
came moro music, checkers, nnd a res
olution to go to church. Tho last
named happens in Moriarty only once
a month, hence tho excitement it
causes, Wo had scarcely taken our

THE BOARD OF HEALTH
MAKES NEW RULING
No new cases of scarlet fever have
been reported to the city physician or
the city board of health and it is
thought tho quarantine wilt soon be
raised allowing the Sunday schools to
be resumed, and perhaps the children
will soon bo permitted to tuke in the
picture shows.
The report of the case breaking out
in the school house last Monday nan
only a farce. The child over-cat at
dinner and played too hard on the
play grounds which caused him to
show symptoms of scat fever. The
teachers took no sluuu-cs and there
fore, the youngster was allowed to
remain at home until the family phys
ician said there was nothing the mat
ter. The following warning has been is
sued to the phyrieiniu antl parents
in order to keep the citj, free from an
epidemic which might necessitate the
closing of the schools.
It has been ruled that chicken pox,
measles and whooping ct ugh are re
portable diseases in this city. Tho
parent as well as tho physicians arc
legally responsible under the law for
the report of these diseases to the
proper health authorities.
A minimum period of modified
quarantine, whereby tho patient shall
be isolated, and the parent permitted
to attend to his usual duties after
reasonable precautions, lies been es
tablished. Chicken pox must be quarantined
until all signs of the eruption have
left the body, from one to two weeks.
Measles will be quarantined a per
iod not less than two weeks.
Whooping cough will be under mod
ified quarantine during the tliscasc un
til all characteristic symptoms have
abated and disappeared.
It is the duty of all parents to con-
line such patients to the house to pro
tect other children until a physician
has seen the case antl made the diag
nosis. It is in the early discovery of
such diseases that an epidemic Is pre
vented or controlcd nnd lives saved.
Any epidemic may lie controlcd by the
wise co-operation of the general pub
lic. Symptoms of Measles
The early symptoms of measles are
watery eyes, sneezing, nasal dischargo
ad breath antl a tendency to sore
throat, with fever. The rash ap
pears about the fourth day usually
upon the back of the neck, and fore
head in the shape of rmnll dark retl
spots. Upon the appcirancc of any
of these symptoms the patient should
be isolated immediately.
The duration of infection is from
two to four weeks.
While this hns been considered ono
of the milder of contagious diseases,
the fact is that neither scarlet fever
nor diphtherin cause as high a death
rate as measles in children from two
to five years of age.
Whooping Cough
Whooping cough is n highly conta
gious diseasu beginning with catar
rhal symptoms and developing within
two weeka to the stage of the par
oxysmal cough. The di lease may last
for an indefinite time. The disease
is peculiarly fatal in oung infants
due to the supervention of broncho
pneumonia and diarrheal conditions.
Chicken Pox
Whilo chicken pox is a mild dis
ease their is danger of the ea.so being
mistaken for small pos which often
accompanies in an oj idemic. Ery
sipelas may result from scratching
the scabs. Tho main difference be
tween chicken pox and smallpox is
that chicken pox fornn the eruption
in successive crops and the scabs fall
off earlier.
FIELD OF REV. E. J. HOERINO
It is with a feeling of relief, that
we nro able to report that the Rev.
E. J. Hocring of St. M ch-iel's, it Tu-
eumcari, has declined a recent call to
become a member of the Cathedral
staff of clergy, in the Diocese of Chi
cago. Thore was not much hesitation
on Mr. Hocring s part in this declina
tion. Any appeal that tho call may
have had to personal predilection was
quickly made subservient to the con
scientious conviction, thut this Mis
sionary District, and his dovotetl peo
ple in Tucumcari, needed him. Such
an attitude is, of course, not extraor
dinary, on the part of our missionary
clergy. Instances are frequent. May
oi , laity as well as the Hishop feel
grateful that our District has men who
can give theso proofs of tho reality
of their consecration nnd fidelity.

A FORREST COUPLE
MARRIED IN TEXAS
The plains people had some real ex-;
citement one day last week and tho
facts as told to the News are about
as follows: 1
.loo Heaver a well known farmer
who lives near Forrest, went back to
Texas several months ago on a visit.
White there lie mot one Joe Hall and
they became friends. Mr. Hall re
turned with Mr. Heaver ami his fain- j
ily to the plain coun.ry about six
months ago and took up bis abode at
the Heavers home.
It seems that Hall took a fancy to
a 14-year old daughter of Mr. antl
Mrs. Heaver and actually fell in love
with her anil she became smitten on
Hall. When this beer me known, so
the story goes, Mr. Heaver objected
most seriously antl asked Hall to leave
his home, which he did.
On Thursday both Hall antl Heavers
were in Melrose on business and Hall
took this opportunity to see his girl.
He hired a car antl drove to the For
rest school house, arriving there lie-,
fore school had been called in the 1
morning on Friday. Miss Heaver
was met by Mr. Hall and they left
in the car, going to Te :ico, thence to !
Fnrwell, Texts, where they were mar-1
rictl. j
In the meantime the father of the
bride had returned home antl got thr I
word of the elopement. He, too, hireo
a car antl followed the couple, going
as far as Texico, thence back to Clo
vis where ho found the run-aways. Ho
caused a warrant to be Issued for the
arrest of Hall on the charge of kid
napping his daughter, and the arrest
was made that night. It is rumored
that Heavers suggestetl if he would
divorce the girl he would not be pros
ecuted. This Mr. Hall refused to do
and saitl he now bad a wife antl would
let the law takes its course. He gave
bond to the nmou, of SHOO for ap
pearance at the next termn of dis
trict court.
We understand that Mr. Hall is a
man thirty years old, has money ant!
lately purchased a farm near Forrest,
but will refiain from commenting on
the intent of him at this time. We
have known young girls who married
men twice their age who were happily
united for life, but in most cases it
has been just the opposite, but here's
hoping that everything will end in
the language of Hilly Hrynn. "peacu
at any price."
MR. HAMILTON BADLY INJURED
Last week the News reported the
accident which happened to C. H. Ham
ilton, as being of minor importance
antl that he would soon recover. This
week it is necessary to say that after
an examination at the Tucumcari Hos
pital it became known that he sus
tained a fractured hip joint which will
require about three months to put
Mr. Hamilton in shape to v.'-lk, and
then it is feared he will never fully
recover.
This is sad news, not only because
he is badly needed in every public
movement but he bus u hig insurance
business which requires considerable
of his personal attention. The acci
dent happened when Mr. Hamilton
stepped out of a slowly moving auto,
ami at no time was it considered so
serious until the X-ray machine was
put into service.

TUCUMCARI 1 1 EST TRADING
POINT IN THIS VICINITY
Another circumstance happened tho
othei day in Tucumcai which prove.'
this city is not so had after all.
A resident of .M.. c.unty, wno had
trailed at Melrose antl points south,
mostly because of the bad roatls be
tween here and the Cn;) Rock, was in
town and visited our ii"rehanU In
view of purchasing (or pricing) some
furniture. She said at first that Fu
eumcari was much higher tin the ar
ticles she wanted and tliat she tlid not
think she would buy anything here
but was just looking .round.
A good salesman knovs when a per
son is fooling, so she was shown tho
goods and pi ices wore compared with
those from other town. Tho custom
er soon taw t'at she hid been misin
formed antl when the b II was totalled
it amounted to something like $1:15,
the goods were propoiSy packed anil
loaded into the wagon for transpor

SALESMANSHIP
Nearly every merchant considers
himself a master salt tmnti, and is
always talking about bow hard it is
to get the man who can sell the goods,
and it would be impossible to convince
that merchant that the fault lies with
himself anil not with the applicants
who are turned down many times
through the petty fai.lt findings of
the so called boss. Tlr word "sales-
ma iship" is not under tood by many
or those people wno U"j it the most.
Many of them think it consists of
selling an article of merchandise, nnd
has nothing to do with the handling
of men, or the different situations
that are always arising in every bus
iness of any consequent e.
I have heard men who wero drawing
down the salary of a manager talk
to a customer, and thought he was
Ubing this so called salesmanship.
while the fact of the matter his talk i
was nffcnnve, but the type of a man 1
before him vas not educated enough
to nppreaciate the fac: thut he was
in the position of a luych and not i
looking for employment?
The finest kind of salesmanship that I
can be used is a thorough knowledge j
or your business, and a heart that has
friendship in it for everyone. The
"put-on" smile if. a puor one at its
best, ami it will not : tnnd the acid
lest. All tho world i. a stage and
some of us play our part so gootl be
cause it is a natural part for us to
play. Many men will waste their time
trying to sell a man wl o is only look
ing around, and if the nro not able
to close the sale right then u tl there
with their wonderful personality nnd
salesmanship, they los. patience and
their customer. The looker of today
may be the buyer of tomorrow and
it is a wise salesman who will let the
customer have a word to say now nntl
then and not try to tell tho customer
his business. Wo are all human and
it is the human touch that is lacking
from tho ice-berg .alesn an, who thinks
that because he sold goods for an old
established firm, that ::nve unlimited
credit, thut he is sonu- pumpkins as
a salesman. The cat Hkes a friendly
stroke of the hand. an' the man with
money in his pocket thit was earned
by hard work, likes to tlo business
with a man who will Meat him with
some trace of friends! ip when he is
not buying anything. If you want
the money antl then get rid of your
customer as quick as possible, jr if
you have put something ove:- on him
because he trusted your judgment,
don't think that you will get av-ay
with It as he will find out and it will
be the hardest thing in thu world to
ever win his confidence again. Treat
others as you would hne others treat
you, and you will conn nearer giving
satisfaction than in irying to beat
everyone that walks iiuo your store..
EVANS CAFE
Mr. J. E. Evans is proprietor of
the Evans Cafe, which is ono of tho
best equipped cafes in tho state. Mr.
Evans was formerly in the restaurant
business at Raton, and sold out hts
restaurant which wns known as tho
"English Kitchen," and opened up his
present place a few weeks ago.
The Evans Cafo is the busiest place
in town as the people of Tucumcari
appreciate first-class service. This
popular place is open day and night,
and has the best tho markets afford
at reasonable prices. Mr. Evans has
been in the cafe business for tho Inst

DOES ADVERTISING PAY
Many of the retail merchants in the
average town of 1000 people, are men
who have advanced from the ranks of
the employee. Their greatest problem
in business is to turn their stocks ovor
as many times a year as thoy can,
antl collect thu gootl hard cash for the
same. Location, supply and demand
has something to do with the success
of many transient storos in Inrge
cities, but it is an entirely different
proposition with the merchant in n
small town where everyone knows
each other. Salesmanship of the best
kind consists of giving tho best value
and service that can be bought for
the money. Advertising will bring
the people into your store, but they
must be attended to after they go in.
If you are unabln to deliver tho goods
then "for heaven's sake" don't blame
the newspaper, if the people refuse
to answer yojr advertising. Value
and gootl service backed up by adver
tising are the weapons thnt havo built
our big stores and every other kind of
business that bus ever made any mon
ey for its stockholders. The old ex
cuse that advertising does not pay is
a confession that you neglected your
opportunity w'.ien the trading people
gave you a call. You can buy your
gootls as cheap as your competitor,
your store is just as modorn, and
everything else being equal, why not
try nnd study your most successful
competitor, ami if he is a little more
polite or giving better service, then
it is up to you.
