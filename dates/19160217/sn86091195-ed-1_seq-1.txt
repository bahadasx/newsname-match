PURE BRED HEREFORDS AND
BIO STEER GO TO DENVER
Mr. E. M. Kennedy has had for a
guest the past week one of the great
est. cattle kings in America, Mr. H. H.
Tomkins of Denver, Colo- This cattle
magnate is president and manager of
the Tomkins Cattle company which has
over 100,000 acres of fenced pastures.
His company ranges over 25000 head of
stock, and raises about 1000 pure bred
Hereford bulls annually. He is a des
cendant of the noted Tomkins family of
England, the founders of the celebrated
Hereford breed of today. Mr. Kennedy
sohl him from his Moore, Idaho, ranch,
fifty head of his registered Hereford
cows and bulls, also his big Hereford
ö^ear-old steer that weighed 2300
pounds. Mr. Tomkins was in search of
blood lines as well as individuals, and
when he found that Mr. Kennedy's
herd carried close descendants of two
royal prize winners of England, and
three grand champions of the American
royals, together with excellent individ
uality, lie discovered that which but
few herds can boast of. The big steer
that also goes to Denver is a typical
Hereford of beautiful individuality and
excellent proportions. He will be fed
and groomed for the Denver show next
year when he should weigh 3000 pounds.
Mr. E. M. Kennedy' lias been a suc
cessful breeder of pure bred stock for
the past fourteen years, a business that
he is naturally adapted to and takes a
great pride in. He loves the game as
well as ttic name of being a breeder of
the pure bred stock, and his reputation
as such is becoming very extensive
among breeders of thoroughbred cattle
nn'd hogs, samples of which can be see.i
at his home corrals in Blackfoot

ANOTHER ROAD FOR BLACKFOOT
That the interurban which is being
planned from Pocatello to the Arbon
valley, is to be part of a link connect
ing Salt Lake with points near Yel
lowstone park, became known last
week when it was stated on good au
thority that the Salt Lake and Ogden
Interurban railways are under contract
with the United States government to
build from Salt Lake to Angel Point
on the Grand Canyon of the Colorado
river in southern Utah and northern
Arizona, to go through the famous
Dixie country in southern Utah and
Knab forest reserve in southern Utah
and northern Arizona, which is the
second largest timber tract in the
United States.
The government is giving interurban
interest big bonuses in timber as
special inducement for building, but
the roads must be completed and in
operation within five years. Salt Lake
and Ogden interurban interests also
confirmed the facts that they were un
der traffic agreements and transfer ar
rangements with the Denver & Rio
~ . ,, . -
Grande, Western Pacific, Missouri Pa
'
cine and Wabash railway companies,
, m „ „ _ • 1 . ' I
and the Wells,Fargo Express company, j
which agreements provide for the build-j
mg of a main interurban line from |
l reston, Idaho, where it is now built,
through Pocatello, Blackfoot, Idaho
Falls and on to the Yellowstone nation
al park, which road also is to be built
within five years.
Early one morning a special train
carrying officials of the Salt Lake and
Ogden Interurban interests passed
through Pocatello en route to Idaho
Falls and the upper Snake river coun
try and probably will go as far north
as- Ashton, looking over the route to
the Yellowstone park. This line is
now built to Preston, Idaho, and will
pass from there through Pocatello and |
on to the park. Among the most im
portant of all the feeders along this
line is the proposed Pocatello anil Ar
bon valley line- However, in spite of j
local efforts to insure this branch for
Pocatello, are found the following facts !
which, if they develop ns it is thought j
they will, would mean that American !
Falls will get the Arbou valley branch
as a feeder through here to the Arbon j
valley line.
Two weeks ago the general manager
of the Utah Construction company per
sonally investigated and reported on
plans looking to the immediate build
ing of an interurban railroad from
American Falls to Arbon valley via
Rockland, Landing and Holbrook. Re
cently Vice-President and Purchasing
Agent Harriman of the Union Pacific
system, accompanied by E. E. Calvin,
general manager of the Short Line, ar
rived ill a special train by appointment
with L. L. Evans, of American Falls,
who is representing the property own
ers along the proposed route. They
went into conference as to the advis
ability of taking up the construction
of the road as outlined by the general
manager two weeks ago.—Pocatello

BOOTLEGGERS' FATE
John Cnverhill was caught

cknowledi
ii the
for 1
cd till
trunk of booze and
same and was convicted.
C. V. Ilollibaugh pleaded guilty to
having red liquor in his possession and
was given thirty days and a fine of
$50. He seems destined to become one
of the county's monthly boarders.
! W. J. Burton pleaded guilty to his
(second charge of bootlegging. This
se.-ond offense makes the old mau a
felon, and entitles him to a free trip to
Boise, where he will be a guest of
Warden Snook for a time yet to be
stipulated by Judge Cowen. This is the
first felonious bootlegger in Biugliam
county
D. W. Wixom who was arrested in
Shelley last week for transporting
booze in a buggy, was tried and acquit
ted in the district court this week.
He met a passenger with a grip full of
booze coming from Montana, and was
caught in the act of transporting them
both to Idaho Falls at 2 o'clock in the
morning. He made the jury believe he
was not aware of the contents of the
valise and they turned him loose.
Pleads Guilty
Milo Andrus of Firth last Friday
pleaded guilty in the district court of
having liquor in his possession and was
fined $3000 by Judge Cowen. The fine
w'aa paid and the automobile that was
confiscated with the 502 pints of whis
key was returned to its owner.

Sunday Picture Houses „
Doomed By a Tie Vote
The city council hel.d its regular
meeting last Tuesday night when there
was a full quorum present, and Mayor
Peck presiding. The minutes of the
previous regular meeting were read and
approved. C. S. Beebe, attorney for
the proprietors of the moving picture
houses was present and presented the
council with a petition containing the
names of 551 legal electors of the Cite
of Blackfoot asking the council to pass
an ordinance giving his clients the
privilege of operating their amuse
ment houses every Sunday. On motion
of Councilman Stephens, seconded by
Councilman Berryman, the petition
was read.
Hon. P. G. Johnston appeared before
the council and asked that the caption
of the petition be re-read, and his re
, ... T .
quest was complied with. He then
. , », ... ....
I presented the council with a petition
j of 655 1)rotegtant8 aillst tlie eni
of 8umlay amuaement h aceom ,
| panied by a very strelmous a(Wre89 why
his pe t ition „hould be heeded by the
council.
Councilman DeKay questioned the
nuinercial strength of the protesting
petition, when Mr. Johnston stated that
he could not vouch for the legality of
all the signatures, but to his knowledge
and belief they were all proper signa
tures. Mr. James Duckworth, one of
the principal opponents of Sunday
shows and a vigorous weilder of then
opposing petitions, was present and de
clared that he could vouch for the
legality of about 620 of the signers on
| the anti-Sunday show petition. Attor
lley Beebe also guaranteed the validity
<>f the signatures on his petition and
made a,, brief statement why it should
j no t be unheeded by the council. Both
Messrs. Duckworth and Johnston-and
! Attorney Beebe made a vigorous at
j tempt to keep the Sabbath holy accofd
! i U g to their respective views on the
subject, and although their ideas Sab
j baticaily had a personal chime to them
at- times, their arguments terminated
in a very friendly and flowery manner.
Councilmen Pelkey and Hesse sug
gested that both petitions be deferred
for further investigation, but Council
men Berryman and Thompson disagreed
with them and moved that the annoy
ing question be disposed of at once and
forever, and their suggestion was ap
proved by the council as well as Mr.
Beeiie.
Before putting the question Mayor
Peek informed the council that regard
less of the petitions there was no man
datory law governing the question un
der debate, but. that the councilmen
were allowed to act according to their
own conscientious scruples in the mat
ter- This construction of the law was
mildly question by Attorney Beebe, but
finally prevailed.
After all the councilmen were given
a chance to express themselves on
Sunday opening of picture shows, the
proposed ordinance was put to a vote
with the following result:
In favor of Sunday picture shows:
riayed 500
Miss Marian Chubhuek entertained a
number of her friends Friday evening

and other pretty valentine decorations.
A dainty luncheon was served at a late
hour after which the guests departed.

wns not required. He merely declared
the motion lost and the ordinance de
feated.
\Prof. Vincent appeared before the
council and protested against the
recklessness and danger of operating
flying switches in the city and was
seconded by Councilmen DeKay and
Berryman and Hamilton Wright. The
trashy dumping ground maintained on
the railroad right-of-way was strongly
condemned by the council and the city
attorney was requested to notify the
railroad authorities of their action in
the matter.
City Engineer Young presented a
petition of tlie residents of Ward s
praying for sewer extension. The mat
ter was referred to the Sewer Commit
tee.
Councilman DeKay moved that the
city attorney be instructed to ask the
Utility Commission's permission for the
city to install a municipal water and
lighting system. His motion was unani
mously' seconded and the city attorney
was instructed accordingly.
Councilman Stephens reported that
the Idaho Lumber company' had signi
fied its willingness to slightly change
the location of the Kirkpatrick ditch
for building purposes on the property
opposite its present office. The owner
of the ditch was agreeable to the
change if the lumber company would
replace the ditch in its present condi
tion, and upon the promise thaî -this
would be done the council gave the
Idaho Lumber company' permission to
make the change
Councilman Berryman reported that
inasmuch as a number of property
owners and representatives in the pro
posed paving district questioned the
legality of the sale of the paving bonds
to Standrod & Co., for 96 cents on the
dollar, which was the best of four bids
received for the sanit^ that the pur
chasrrs of the bonds were willing to re
voke their contract if the city desired
them so to do. Councilman DeKay
stated that Attorney Jones who repre
sents more property in the proposed
paving district than any other resident,
informed him that while he was not
opposing the paving, he did not believe
the bonds were either legally' or ad
vantageously sold, and that he would
enjoin the council from consummating
their present saie. Mr. Jones contends
that the bUnds, which are (i per cent.
10-year issue, should bring par in place
of 96 cents on the dollar.
Weber Bros, were granted permission
to erect a brick boiler room in block
12, lots 17, 18, 19 and 20.
Before adjourning the council went
into executive session from which the
scribes and all the city attaches were
summarily excused bv the mayor.

THE BOYDS GET THE ISIS
After a brief and unprofitable ex
perience as a showman Charley Hilliard
has retired from the management of th"
Isis theatre with a wealth of experience
that has taught him thnt there is no
money in Blackfoot for two moving
picture houses, whose patrons demand
better service than they can pay for.
Mrs. Boyd and son Robert, who have
become very popular in Blackfoot
thcatredom have taken the Isis, and bv
running it in connection with the
Orpheum, hope to make a decent living.
The seating cnpacity or patronage of
either of the Blackfoot houses is not
sufficient to pay the nightly expense
of about $25.00, and Saturday nights
are the only nights that give the pro
prietors "a profit for their labor and in
vestment. The floating population who
have no home or friends to pass their
evenings with are the best patrons of
picture houses, and that population is
not very populous in Blnrkfoot
