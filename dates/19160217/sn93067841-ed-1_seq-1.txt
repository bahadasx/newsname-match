RESIGNATION OF
SECRETARY OF WAR,
i
DISAGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT
ON PLANS FOR THE NATION
3 AL DEFENSE?SURPRISE FELT
Washington,February 10:?Secre
. r
tary Garrison resigned today becaus<
President Wilson would not "irrevo
cably" support the continental arm)
plan, and because the Secretary ol
\ War opposes the Administration's
nlnn nf settinc a definite time foi
Philippine independence.
President Wilson accepted the res
'. ignation and has not selected a sue
% cessor. The President himself wil
probably take personal charge of the
Administration's national plans in
Congress.
Assistant Secretary Breckenridge
^hlso resigned as a mark of loyalty tc
his chief, whose view he shares. The
President accepted his resignation
Both take effect immediately. Majoi
A Gen Scott,chief of staff of the army,
automatically becomes Secretary ol
f . War ad interim.
* It is known that one of Secretary
2 Garrison's principal reasons for his
! conviction that only a Federal continental
army,instead of a reorganized
National Guard, could be the main
military' dependence of the nation
? was his belief that some day the
* United States may be called upon tc
fka M/-?r?*vw3 Hnntrinp and in
U^lVUVt VKV MAVMA VV Vivw
that event he foresaw that the Nail
tional Guard might not be available
[4 for use outside of the United States
before a declaration of war.
CAUSE OF PARTING.
. Upon the contention, on the one
hand, that the continental army or
ultimately universal service was the
nation's only reliance, and the position,
on the other, that no one plan
could be enforced upon Congress,
President Wilson and his Secretary
of War parted official company.
Mr Garrison's resignation was a
complete surprise to official Washington
generally, He made no per\
sonal explanation. Several hours beif
fore the official announcement he
had boarded a train with his wife
for New York, and word had been
passed at the war department that
he had gone for an indefinite stay.
The acute differences of opinion
which led to the break began early
in the year, when opposition to the
continental army plan began developing
in Congress.
;
There had been indefinite rumors
of the possibility of the Secretary of
iWar leaving the Cabinet, but they
were-never countenanced in official
f quarters. -The Secretary everywhere
was regarded as one of the strong
men of the Administration upon
whom the President leaned in the
r difficult situations,both domestic and
1 international,which have marked his

Exhibit to be Held with Fair.
Teacher and Pupils:?

j This arrangement will allow more
. time for the usual contests. I wish
i to impress on you, however, the importance
of preparing this exhibit
1 now, and placing it on display at
your closing exercises. Leave it in
careful hands during the vacation
i and it will come in well as a good
beginning for a creditable display at
the fair.
The date for Field Day has not
yet been set, but will probably be
: the first or second week in April,
j The several contests will be practically
the same as last year. The oratorical
and expression contests for
' boys and girls will take place at
night. All other contests will come
i off the next day. For determining
entries in the several contests, Class
4,A" means the high school grades,
Class "B" means the 6th and 7th
grades, Class "C," the lower grades.
Each class will be given tests in comi
position, reading,writing, arithmetic,
' spelling and map-drawing. There
will also be a contest for the elementary
grades in declamation for
the boys and recitation for the girls.
Only one contestant from a school
may be entered in any class.

A PROFITABLE MEETING
01 Klngstree Home Demonstration
Clnb.
The Kingstree Hofie Demonstration
club held its regular meeting in
Miss Amanda Edwards' office on
Monday afternoon, February 14,
with a good attendance. The subject
for this meeting was yegetables
and fruits. Several helpful suggestions
were given by the ladies, and
the president of the club, Mis3
Maude Logan, read an interesting
paper on winter vegetables. Besides
the study for the afternoon
the ladies accepted a constitution
and by-laws that tne executive committee
submitted to them. At the
close of the meeting Miss Edwards
served a delightful fruit salad. At
the suggestion and request of several
of the members Miss Edwards
decided to publish several recipes
from time to time in The County |
Record so that all the ladies of the j
county will be given the opportunity '
to use them. In this way all the j
ladies will be reached and we trust |
will be influenced to join one of the j
clubs nearest her and help out in
this much needed work of improv- j
ing the homes and communities.
