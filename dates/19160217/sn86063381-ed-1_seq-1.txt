HOME TALENT AT
GRAND TONIGHT
"Singbad the Sailor to Be Produced
Under Auspices of Episcopal
Church.
"Singbad the Sailor," a comic
opera, will be presented tonight at
the Grand theater by home talent
under the auspices of the Episcopal
church.
The plot of the play was taken
from the story of the same name
among the Arabian Nights* tales.
Mystic and fierce backgrounds form
a strange but enticing contrast with
the element of comedy carried
throughout the entire plot.
"Singbad" in his roaming travels
on the high seas, lands at an island
and is about to found a musical stu
dio when is discovered by beautiful
Qieen Gulnara She falls in love
with him upon hearing his voice. Not
until after the hero has promised to
remain on the island as king does he
learn that the island is infested with
cannibals, who are desirous of his
carcass. By a rash mistake the can
nibals capture Queen Gulnara in
stead of her newly-wed husband, but
before burning her for steak dis
cover their mistake.
The "brown boys" are forgiven
and the queen and her king are final
ly surprised to find that Princess Am
inta and the calyph have been cor
responding and are engaged. Mat
ters are soon soothed over with en
tertaining strains of comedy which
gives the play an ending satisfactory
to all.
