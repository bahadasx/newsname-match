A N N A E O O 1915
SHOWS GROWTH OF AGRICUL
TURAL WORK IN COUNTY
Project Basis For Present Year Prom
ises System and Greater
Efficiency
In his annual report to the directors
of Williams County Better Farming
Association County Agent E. W. Hall
reviews the work of the past year and
while he modestly confines himself to
a plain statement of facts, figures and
conditions, these are sufficient to re
veal a large measure of growth in all
departments of the work and a spirit
of cooperation between all factors
that gives assurance of greater effi
ciency for the future.
The statistics of the report gives
some surprising figures. There are
now 41 farmers' clubs, during the
year 52 public meetings were held
with a total attendance of 7,466. The
agent traveled 11,448 miles and, al
though travel by car in December
was almost impossible, visited 369
farms. Forty-eight farmers are co
operating in demonstration work de
voting 377 acres to the purpose. A
definite system of project work, the
plans for which were published in
these columns recently, has been laid
out for 1916 which should be of much
assistance to all concerned.
The Report In Full
The Honorable Board of Directors,
Williams Co. Better Farming Asso.,
Williston, North Dakota.
Gentlemen:
The following is the report of E.
W. Hall, Agricultural Agent in Wil
liams County for the year 1915:
The main efforts of the Field Agent
during the past year has been direct
ed along the following lines:
1. Work to strengthen and make
more efficient the Farmers' Clubs in
the county and help to start more
clubs.
2. The introduction of pure bred
sires.
3. Corn growing.
4. Alfalfa production, especially
Grimm alfalfa in rows.
5. The Farm Boys'. Hike, and the
Farmers' Club investigation tour.
6. The Annual County Short Course
and other meetings.
There are at present forty-one
Farmers' Clubs in the county. It is
a disappointment to have to state
that a number of these clubs are dead.
The local Farmers' Club is the unit
on which all organized effort must be
based. No large organization can be
effective without live and active units.
Marketing organizations, breeding as
sociations and credit associations, as
well as all other organizations for the
betterment of the community, will be
the natural outgrowth of the Farm
ers' Club. For this reason, it is im
portant that the clubs should be alive,
studying and working together tio
bring about greater prosperity for
their different communities.
Eight new clubs were assisted in
making a start by the County Agent
in 1915.
Some of these clubs outlined work
for the Field Agent which has proved
to be the most effective he has car
ried on. The clubs had charge of all
but two of the agricultural meetings
held in the county during 1915, and
were personally responsible for these
meetings, paying the expenses of the
same in full or in part.
The County Agent has not assisted
in the purchase of as many cure bred
sires this year as in 1914. The work
was not well grounded in 1914, and
many farmers were induced to buy
Inferior sires for the sake of the pedi
gree alone. During 1915 therefore,
the County Agent in talking at meet
ings and to individuals was very care
ful to emphasize the importance of
the individual as well as the pedigree.
He has found that it is better to help
a farmer to buy a sire, than to buy
one for him, and if he is not willing
to buy a good one, it is better not to
encourage him in buying at all, as the
poor bred is a hindrance to the cam
paign for the use of pure bred sires.
The growing of corn was a failure
in the county this year as far as ripe
corn for seed was concerned. No seed
was obtained except on one farm near
Williston. A good deal of fodder was
obtained wherever corn was planted
in the right shape and the right kind
of seed used. The best corn was along
the river on the lighter land, where
it was warmer. One farmer hogged
off fifty acres successfully. This was
the Gehu flint variety. It is the opin
ion of the Field Agent that the
acreage of corn in the county in 1916
will be about the same as in 1915.
Many will not plant because thev art
easily discouraged, but those who are
in livestock to stay will need more
corn next year than last, and this will
make up the acreage. It will be the
aim of the Field Agent to work hard
to keep up the acreage. No seed corn
was saved in the county, but two
hundred bushels have been purchased
to sell at cost to the farmers who ars
most interested in corn growing.
The alfalfa acreage increased satis
factorily this year. Many acres of
Grimm alfalfa in rows was seeded. It
was impossible for the Field Agent
to get around to all the farmers who
were seeding alfalfa, but he assisted
as many as possible, especially those
(Continued on page 8) Arnegard schools.

Boy Loses Life When
House Was Burned
SAD DISASTER AT ELK LANDING
—GRAND SON OF CAPTAIN
SENCHAL DIES OF BURNS
In a fire that burned to the ground
the residence of Bret A. Douglas at
Elk Landing, about sixty miles down
the river, the eight year old son, Bret
A. Douglas Jr., was so severely burn
ed that he died at 1:30 Sunday, the
fire occurring at 5:00 p. m., Satur
day. The boy was alone in the house
at the time, his father, mother and
little sister being at the nearby store.
The mother had gone for things for
supper and the boy in trying to hasten
the kitchen fire poured kerosene on it.
Live coals caused the stream of oil
to burst into flames and shoot into his
face and he breathed them. He drop
ped the can and made a valient effort
to quench the fire, with water but
there was not enough water. He bore
his suffering bravely and talked to
almost the end.
The remains were brought to Tioga
and from there were taken to Lehigh,
Iowa, for burial. Bret A. Douglas is
a son in law of Captain E. Senechal,
the river boat operator, and the de
ceased boy was the captain's only
grandson.
Local Wheat Wins
Prize For Quality
Williams county Powers Fife wheat
raised by H. C. Blankenship of Mis
souri Ridge won second prize at the
Pure Seed Contest held in connection
with the Grain Growers convention
at Fargo and was only a fraction of
one per cent from the top. Mr. Blan
kenship has just received the red rib
bon badge awarded by the judges and
a $15.00 cash prize offered by the
Duluth Board of Trade.
A sample of this variety of wheat
raised on the celebrated Kelly farm
near Devils Lake was ranked first
with a score of 99.74 while Mr. Blan
kenship's sample received a mark of
99.40.
Base Ball Meeting
Next Tuesday Night
Williston will have a ball team next
summer—that is as good as settled.
It is high time to get ready—organize
and get lines out for players before
the good ones are all taken.
The fans and all in anywise inter
ested are notified to attend a meet
ing at H. V. Smith's office next Tues
day evening at 8 o'clock. Over in
Montana there is some sentiment for
a league to include, perhaps, Glendive,
Sidney, Havre, Chinook, Glasgow and
Williston.
Several of last year's players have
already written that they want to get
on with Williston again.
-Vote
Go to the polls tomorrow and vote
on the question of armory-auditorium
bonds. A vote for the bonds is a vote
for cooperation—for community econ
omy—a vote to save the community
$7,000.00 or $8,000.00—a vote to put a
splendid business drawing asset on
a safe and sound basis without a dol
lar of cost to the tax pavers—a vote
to give the city an absolutely neces
sary institution. A vote against the
bonds is a vote to stand in the way
of the community's progress for
technical reasons. Any proposition
on earth is open to criticism—the
broad, liberal, view that considers the
greatest good for the greatest num
ber is what makes for community
errowth. There is every reason to be
lieve that the auditorium will pav for
itself if not handicapped by high in
terest. Money will be coming into the
sinking fund and accruing interest for
eleven years before an" bonds mature.
If the city should have to pav fc few
thousand dollars at the end of twenty
years it would probably not break her
or any of her citizens.
Turn out and vote for the bonds—
let's have an all round civic necessity
—a general assembly hall and play
house of amnle capacity—a much
needed gymnasium—a building that is
an ornament and pride—and let it be
long to the citv in return for the city's
aid. It is strictly a community issue.
WILL RESIDE IN WILLISTON
William Husebye, a member of the
firm of Stenehjem & Husebye of Ar
negard passed through Williston en
route to Bottineau where he will be
married February 19th to Miss Anna
C. Vikan. Mr. Husebye's brother, J.
A. Husebye of this city accompanied
him. Wm. Husebye is building a fine
residence in Williston and after a two
months wedding tour to the Pacific
coast he and his bride will make their
home here. The young people met

78 CORNERS VERSUS
79 CORNERS, WHICH?
FINE WEATHER FOR CUTTING
WHEAT-HOT STOVE HARVEST
ERS HAD BUSY WEEK
The mathematical heads got right
after the binder problem this week
and solutions have been coming in
verbally, by letter and by phone. The
Graphic's binder problem editor has
so far met a happier fate than the
Minneapolis Journal man. After
conducting a binder problem depart
ment for about a month the Journal
man threw up his hands and hollered
nuff. His office was so packed with
letters, cards, drawings, telegrams
and voluminous arguments that there
was just room for him to crawl out
the door—and he crawled. He says
he opened and read 21,000 of 'em and
some 7,000 remained untouched, more
coming. He willed the whole lot to
the office janitor who went at them
with a coal scoop.
The Problem
Two eight-foot binders, the same
one always in the lead, cut wheat in a
square, 160-acre field. Each is pre
sumed to cut a full eight-foot swath
and the head binder always turns the
corners before the second arrives. Af
ter each machine has made 20 full
rounds how much more wheat, if any,
(expressed in square feet) has the
head binder cut than the second
binder
It is assumed that both machines
will cut straight out into the stubble
at the end of the 20th round.
Just three different answers have
come to the Graphic—10,112—9,984—
4,992. The biggest stumbling block
is just how many corners or quarter
turns are made by the binders -78 or
79. Most everybody agrees that the
outside binder cuts 128 sq. ft. more
than the inside binder at each cor
ner. One person can see but 64 sq.
ft. difference at each corner.
The First and Last
The real tough spots in this har
vesting job are at the start in and
come out. Twenty rounds make 80
corners, less one because the ma
chines cut straight in at the start
(like the lower end of the diagram
below) and, some say, less one more
because the machines are specified to
cut straight out at the end of the last
round. Ah! ah! look out there, are
you sure of that? It is easy to be
sure of it—just dead certain that the
number of corners or quarter turns is
78. The problem editor was so sure
of it for a couple of days he was al
most ready to fight, or bet money on
it. He had support in his contention,
too, Joe Cutting and the editor held
a two day debate with W. J. Kelly on
the other side. But what is the use to
argue with a person like Kelly—we
never made a dent in him. The fact
was W. J. was right but he could not
state his points in terms sufficiently
strong ana sharp to penetrate—well
solid substances. Possibly Joe and
the editor held out after they had
been penetrated.
Where the Catch Comes
Here is where the 9,984 adherents
slip a cog—there is no turn made
where the machines start in, that's a
cinch, and none made at the last or
finish corner as the machine.? come out
at the end of the 20th round—BUT.
that start and finish corner is turned
when the 20th round is begun. Just
start in and chase yourself around the
edsre of a rug 20 times and keeD
count—that is what the problem edi
tor did and it is convincing. Five
times or three times will serve quite
as well.
So vou miss only one corner and
must turn 79 of them. The diagram
used herein proves by the pmall
squares, each of which renre«en+~ 64
so. ft., that the head or outside bind
er cuts three of the squares to ona by
the inside binder, or a difference of
128 sq. ft.

WAR SECRETARY
RESIGNS HIS POST
DIFFERENCES OVER CONTINEN
TAL ARMY PLAN CAUSES
BREAK WITH PRESIDENT
First Assistant Breckenridge Also
Quits—General Hugh L. Scott
Made Acting Secretary
Washington, Feb. 11.—President
Wilson late today issued a formal or
der designating Major General Hugh
J. Scott, chief of staff, to act as sec
retary of war "for a period not to ex
ceed 30 days, or until a successor
shall have been appointed and quali
fied."
Washington, Feb. 11.—What the
Peen
resident and the administration have
dreading happened yesterday
when Lindley M. Garrison resigned as
secretary of war.
But now that that is over with,
probably the president feels easier.
Garrison has been, threatening him
with this resignation ever since he
came into the cabinet.
Twice Offered Resignation
He offered it twice, once over the
Mexican policy and once when the
E•avies
resident wanted to make Joseph E.
governor general of the Phil
ippines. He wrote it privately, ready
to be served, at the first Lusitania
crisis when Bryan was pressing the
president to accept arbitration.
He tore it up when Bryan, instead
of himself, was forced out.
Quits Over Continental Army
He finally resigned over the conti
nental army scheme which he found
the president was not supporting very
hard.
Assistant Secretary Henry C. Breck
inridge also resigned as a mark of
loyalty to his chief and his resigna
tion also was immediately accepted.
General Hugh Scott, chief of staff of
the army, automatically became act
ing secretary of war.
Some days before the president
started on his western trip it was
known here that he was not going to
make a fight for the continental army
but only for preparedness. Secretary
Garrison declined to believe it. But
the president went out and did practi
cally what had been predicted, he
threw the continental army to the
winds.
Vexed Over Hay's Visit
Garrison was pretty sore, and when
he lepnied that Chairman James Hay
of the house military committee had
been to the White House just before
the president's start for the west, and
told him the continentals were a dead
issue, the secretary decided to quit.
However, to make sure of his posi
tion he went to the president on Tues
day last, told him he had been asked
to speak on preparedness before the
United States Chamber of Commerce
and suggested that what he might say
possibly would not be in accordance
with the administration program.
He did this to put the president
finally on record on the continental
army. The president turned him
down cold, with a retort that Mr. Gar
rison might say .what he pleased, pro
vided he let it be known lie spoke his
own views.
Rapidfire decision was Garrison's
great asset. It is not seem to be so
much a question of right decision as
of getting there early.
He was always on hand when the
store opened with some decisions. He
was usually wrong.
He was wrong about the water
power question and insisted on being
more wrong every minute. So mark
ed was his antagonism to any policy
that savored of putting public rights
above the vested variety that the
friends of decent legislation became
thoroughly discouraged.
Lately they had taken to trying to
reach the president over Mr. Garri
son's head. The president was bom
barded with letters from conserva
tionists and the Garrison idea was
getting hard raps.
Method, Not Plan, Opposed
He had not reckoned with the opin
ion of congress. He had no capacity
to gage the opinion of a congress. He
knew only what he imperiously wish
ed. He wished the continentals. Con
gress wished it back on him promptly.
But congress could have been lea up
to the continental army. It had' no
inherent objections to it.
It has considerable objections to the
Garrison ukase method of reaching
the question,
In loving Mr. Garrison the presi
dent has not lost any votes in con
gress or out. No member of the
cabinet had less personal or political
following than Garrison.
The country, however, will feel that
the secretary of war was an able man
and that the president has suffered a
loss. In a measure he has, but not
one that cannot be overcome.
President May Name Houston
Up to late today the president had
made no decision as to Mr. Garrison's
successor, but it looks very much

Stanley-Williston
Basket Ball Game
The Williston Community Center
basket ball team went to Stanley last
Thursday for a game with the Stan
ley team. There was a big turnout
at the game, the galleries and side
lines being filled with enthusiastic
spectators. The game was lively and
full of "pep" throughout but the Wil
liston team proved too brawny and too
well trained for their opponents.
For the first five minutes of the
game Stanley was in the lead but
when the visitors got their bearings
in the strange hall the tide turned and
the score at the end was rather lop
sided—89 to 26 for Williston.
The line-up of the Williston team
was:
Center—M. R. Marston forwards—
Harding (captain), O. Cunningham
guards—Jay Batten, Dewey Marston
substitute Bobbie Teisk.
The Stanley team is composed of
business and professional men. After
the first five minutes they seemed to
lose control of their team work and
failed to follow up their shots which
cost them the heavy defeat.
Coach Donelson, who was former
ly with the university of Washington
has worked up a splendid athletic
spirit in Stanley and they took de
feat very sportsmanlike. They will
come to Williston in a short time for
a return game and expect to have a
stronger team and reverse the score.
WILL ASSIST DR. LADD
F. R. Babcock of the Williston sub
station farm has gone to Fargo to re
main several weeks and assist Dr. E.
F. Ladd, pure food commissioner, in
making milling and baking tests of
about ten varieties of wheat from each
of eight different stations, including
the Williston station. Dr. Ladd has
a complete outfit for this work in
cluding a minature flour mill. His
selection of Mr. Babcock for this work
is a distinct mark of confidence in the
latter's ability and reliableness.
One Hundred And

Washington, Feb. 14.—Census bu

the population of the United States
on January 1, last, was 101,208,315,
and that by July 1, it would be 102,
017,302. Only July 1, last year, they
figured the population at 100,399,318.
Western states have led in growth,
Washington heading the list with
Oklahoma, Nevada, North Dakota and
New Mexico following in the order
named.
The bureau's estimates are based
on the rate of increase between the
1900 and 1910 censuses.
Stockdale's Talks
Have Great Interest
Frank Stockdale, member of the
staff of System magazine, commercial
organizer, advertising and efficiency
expert, was the Monday night lyceum
course attraction. Mr. Stockdale's
address was strictly commercial and
bristled with good points, taking for
it's theme "The Future of Williston."
He dealt largely with the subject of
retailing, contending that the pros
perity of a town in large measure de
pends on the prosneritv of it's mer
chants. He kept the audience intense
ly interested in the seemingly dry
topic. He strongly urged community
organization, with all interests repre
sented, under paid, expert leadership.
Tuesday afternoon Mr .Stockdale
talked to a large gathering of retail
merchants at Odd Fellows hall. As
a result a committee composed of A.

HAULERS, MINERS,

COAL STRIKE LASTED ONLY TWO
DAYS—HAULERS AND MINERS
RESUME WEDNESDAY
Operators Concede Part of Advance
Claimed by Men—Retail Price
Now $3.00
Demanding an advance of 25 cents
for hauling and 15 cents for mining
nearly all the men engaged in haul
ing lignite coal from the mines to the
city and a large number of the miners
announced Saturday evening that a
strike was on and refused to go tp
work Monday. The teamsters con
tended that the condition of the road*
and the weather, $20. hay and other
feed in proportion made it impossible
for them to make the wages they for
merly did. The miners claimed that
both powder and board is higher than
formerly and reduced their earnings.
The haulers were receiving 70 cents
per ton from the Husebye mine, 75
from the Ellithorpe mine and $1.00
from the Black Diamond, Breen and
Head Mines.
The miners received 90 cents per
2,100 pounds for what is known as
entry work and 70 cents for room
work. There was no strike at the
Black Diamond mine except part of
the haulers.
It was rather freely conceded that
there was merit in the claims of the
men and at least two of the mine own
ers say that if the men had made their
request sooner it would have been
granted quite as readily without a
walkout as with one. The two days
interruption, they say, resulted in the
loss of a few of the miners, who left
for other points, and made the al
ready congested coal situation worse.
Advance Granted
Monday afternoon the men met at
the court house and talked the situa
tion over. The meeting was very
Jairness
iuiet and a spirit of moderation and
prevailed. They were entire
ly without organization but several'
speakers discussed the situation and a
motion prevailed to appoint commit
tees from the haulers and miners to
wait on the operators. The follow
ing composed the committees: Haul
ers A. McDonald, Louis Mclntyre,
Joe Running Miners Andy Scott, D.
Penman, J. Kelly.
At the conference the haulers were
offered an advance of 20 cents and
the miners an advance of 10 cents.
It was accepted and work resumed
Wednesday morning. As a result the
retail price has been advanced from
$2.75 to $3.00 per ton.
The Girl From
Panama Tuesday
All people who do not believe in the
great gospel of laughter are hereby
requested to keep awav from the per
formance of one of the most enjoy
able of musical comedies.
In order that there may be room
for the many to whom there is noth
ing more delightful than seventy-five
minutes of sparkling fun and tune
ful music.
If you are ill do not fly to the doc
tor, but let The Frank Rich Company
prescribe. They are sure to do you
more good than a barrel of medicine.
It is said that every real laugh adds
a day to your life. See "The Girl'
From Panama" and live longer. Give
yourself a treat. See The Frank Rich
Company at The Orpheum starting
Tuesday and running three days with
a change of program daily.
See them and laugh as you never
laughed before. See them if you miss
everything this season. See them and
be happy.
Popular prices always. Two per
formances nightly and a matinee
daily.
Of them the Miles City Star says:
"Last night's play, The Girl From
Panama" which was presented by
The Frank Rich Company and The
20th Century Maids was one of the
cleverest productions the company has
ever given here.
Lots of music, lots of girls, lots of
fun, lots ef ginger, made it a rapid

the footlights in great style.
Dull care was conspicious by Its
