WAR MUNITIONS
POUR INTO EUROPE
Shipments From America
Are Worth Two Millions
Each Day.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feu. 17
American moilo war muntlions now
are pouring into Europe at the rate of
nearly $2,0 0 0,000 worth dally, with the
figures sweling rapidly as production
increases. For a long timo after the
war began shipments were negligible,
and not until the middle of 1915 did
the millions of dollars' worth of war
materials contracted for begin to movo
in considerable quantities.
Estimates made at the department
of commerce today put total muni
tions shipments sincesEurope began
to purchase for the present war at
close to a quarter of a billion dollars.
At the rate shipments are going now
the next four months would see this to
tal doubled even it production remain
ed at a standstill. But production is
declared to bo growing faster than
at any time since American manufac
turers began conversion of their plants
into munition factories.
A great part ot the munitions output
has been in the form of high explosive
shells, more tli?n $100,000,000 worth
of which have left American shores
Powder comes next with shipments
estimated at nearly $100,000,000 and
small arm cartridges are third with
$30,000,000.
Firearms, Including ordnance ex
ports, are put at less than $20,000,000,
with small increases shown. The
heaviest noN's firearm shipments
was In January, 1915, when more than
$2,000,000 went to Europe.
Great Britain 1b using now three
times as much American products as
any other foreign country and Is ab
sorbing more than one-third ot all
American exports, Export trade fig
ures made public -today by the De
partment of Commerce, show that the
British purchases of all kinds in the
United States last year amounted to
$1,191,000,000.
France holds second place among
America's customers with purchases
last year of about half a billion; Can
ads Is third with $944,000,000, and
Italy fourth" with aquarter of a bil

Both Sides Are Having a
Heap of Fun Out of

BUT ARE WORKING HARD
Applications" So Far Turned
in Total Three Hundred
Fifteen.
The membership campaigners of the
Y. M. C. A. on the Red side ran Into
a regular Liege yesterday evening,
which threatens to halt their march to
victory unless reinforcements are
brought up today and tomorrow. The
Blues, who never lost heart when they
were defeated the first day, brought
home the bacon yesterday evening,
and passed a total ot 2815 points over
the counter. The day previous the
Blues had been able to hand the bcc*
retary ot the Y. M. C. A. but 1325
points, which,, added to what was turn
ed in by them yesterday, brings their
total for the twp days to 41b0. The
Reds, who led by several lengths the
first day, were on the short end of
yesterday's proceedings, the carmines
being able to nail but 2203 points from
sun up to sun down. On the first day
tho Reda started oft like a streak of
lightning, and passed the bar with
such a cargo of applications that the
Blues were a long way behind. On
this date they secured 1727 points,
which, added to yesterday's 2203,
brings the passion color to 3930. The
Blues are now leading by 200 points,
which is a smaller lead than that
which the HoJa had on the first day.
The total number of applications so
far recorded by Secretary Klght Is
315.

LUSITANIA CASE ;
AGAIN WIDE OPEN
This Government Wants to
Know About New Ger
man Order.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.?Secretary
Lansing said today, that the German
government's announced intention of
sinking armed merchantmen without
warning after February 29, has re
opened the'entire question of subma
rine warfare.
The Lusitania agreement presented
today, cannot be finally accepted until
the United States determined whether
anything in it conflicts with the new
policy of sinking armed merchant
ships.
j It was pointed out that American
officials realized that the Lusitania
agreement refers to "liners" and that
the newly announced German subma
rine policy refers to all armed ships.
I Before the Lusitania agreement final
ly is accepted it will be necessary to
clarify the situation.
In his conference with Secretary
Lansing today, the German' ambassa
| dor discussed the advisability of a
postponement of the effective date of
the new 'submarine orders to give op
portunity for negotiations. Secretary
Lansing did not commit himself and
made no comment.
Count von Bernstorff told Secretary
Lansing it .was his-personal opinion
that in carrying out the new subma
rlne campaign It was not the inten
tion of - the German government to
sink "liners." Mr. Lansing Is under
stood to have Informed him that such
a statement from the German gov
ernment would be desirable.
It developed that when the German
Ambassador presented the. draft'of
the Lusitania agreement.more than
a week ago, he at that time informed
t?e state department of his govern
ment's new submarine policy which
later was announced from Vienna and
German embassy -officials declared
they could not understand why the
situation should be disturbed because
they understood the Lusitania negotia
tion all along were conducted as ap
plying to unarmed ships. It was es-.
;tabUshed after' the; sinking . that' the
Loaltanla bore no armament.
It is: praotlcally: certain -that the
United "States wlllask'to be specifi
cally Informed that th$. assurances
previously given'for the safety of neu
trals and-non-combatants at sea have
not been and will not be altered by
the latest deolaratlona ot the Berlin

FALL OF n
IMFHAHT LVEIT
Will Have Important Influ
ence on War In the
Near East.
LONDON, Feb. 17.?With the cap
ture of Erzerum by the Russians Inter
est in the war operations has shitted
its center momentarily to the fields
of warfare in Armenia, Persia and
Mesopotamia, where the campaigns
are expected to be notably influenced
by the fall of the Turkish stronghold.
The current Turkish official state
ment gives no clew to the course of
events following the capture ot the
fortress, and indeed does not rocord
that happening. The only mention ot
the operation in this war area is the
declaration that the Russians in the
fighting of the three days preceeding
lost 5,000 dead and 60 prisoners.
Unofficial advices from Petrograd
say the Turkish army is fleeing west
ward front Ercerum through a diffi
cult mountain region'. Military observ
ers in allied capitals who regard Er
zerum ? as the key to Asia Minor ex
pect the Russian success, to facilitate
capture of Trebizond-on the Black.
Sea coast to the north, giving posses
sion to the Turkish gateway from ASia
into Europe, while the Turkish forces
through Armenia will be put In jop
ordy. it is argued, and the pressure
on the British in Mesopotmia will be
relieved. Operations on large scale
by the Russians will now be possible
for the force ot Grand Duke Nicholas
it is declared.
Fighting on the western front has
lessened in intensity probably because
of the prevailing bad weather and simi
lar conditions prevail in Russia.
Hotel Directors to
Discuss Plans
l/rtrmimt hotel have been unable to
decide upon any of the architests'pre*;
posals which have been submitted, so
tonight a meeting of the directors of
the company is called.
The committee hopes with the help
of the directors and officials ot the
company, to bo able to eliminate all
but three or four of the most desir-.
able of the plans tonight. Then the
committee will tabulate and consider
further the remaining: ones until fin
ally one is selected that will be tho
most suitable,
The directors' meeting is set for 7.30
tonight and it is likely that the work
of removing the present buildings on
the hotel site will be authorized and
the work started at once.
