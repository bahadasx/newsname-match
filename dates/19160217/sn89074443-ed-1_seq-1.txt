WHAT IS COMING?
Asks the Devil's Lake Journal
$
Editorial in \Syils Lake Journal
$.
The average North Dakota politicianx ^»ht now is bothered by the thought of what is coming
down the road as a result of the organizatk ^of the Nonpartisan League. Privately the poli
ticians, or at least most of them, are sweativ .large drops of their precious. political blood.
They are scared, plumb, cold, stark scared. T\ fear a whirlwind has been started in the state
and cyclone cellars are appearing more inviting day by day.
N° one, of course, knows just what the influence of the Nonpartisan League will be in the
politics of North Dakota in 1916. It is an organization which today is said to possess a member
ship of between thirty and forty thousand farmers. Its«ff»irs thus far have been handled with
rare judgment and business sense Somewhere in the affairs are brain? of an unusual order.
The question will be "Can those brains which founded the league control its course in action?" ^5
The answer to that question is the answer to the biggest question in North Dakota state
politics today. Organizations of this kind have a faculty of being misled, of becoming disorgan
ized quickly, and of frittering away their strength on non-essentials. UNDOUBTEDLY TODAY
HANNA AND McCUMBER AND McKENZIE HAVE THEIR AGENTS AT WORK IN THE
COUNCILS OF THE NONPARTISAN LEAGUE ATTEMPTING TO CONTROL A POLITICAL
FORCE WHICH THESE PRECIOUS REACTIONARIES HAVE FOUND DIFFICULT TO
OPENLY FIGHT. WILL THE LEAGUE BE CAPTURED BY THE AGENTS OF THESE MEN
BROUGHT INTO THE CAMP OF HANNA OR McCUMBER, OR WILL IT ACTUALLY GO ON
ABOUT ITS AVOWED BUSINESS OF MAKING A CLEAN SWEEP IN THE STATE?
We shall see. The Nonpartisan League is expected to hold a state meeting in March for the
purpose of endorsing state officials who will put through a reform program at Bismark. The
people of the state will await the action of the league with unusual interest.
Will You Answer Correctly?
That is the question—will the League be captured by the politicians and turned over to the enemies of all progress
or will it actually go on about its avowed business of making a clean sweep in the state?"
^/^wThe answer to this question RESTS WITH YOU MEMBERS OF THE LEAGUE.
So far, you have taken no active part. Most of you have been watching closely to see if the men at the head of
this organization were on the square.
FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY FEBRUARY 17: 1916 WHOLE NO. 22
pa Next Tuesday afternoon, February 22, at 2 o'clock, you make your first answer to that question.
If every member of the League is alive to this great opportunity—if you afl gather at your voting plaee and then
select for precinct delegate A MAN WHOM THE POLITICIANS AND MIDDLEMEN CAN NOT INFLUENCE—then Ml
you have answered "YES!" THE LEAGUE WILL GO ON ABOUT ITS AVOWED BUSINESS MAKING A CLEAN
SWEEP IN THE STATE.
dlemen to control your precinct
ler can do will win your cause.
THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR
