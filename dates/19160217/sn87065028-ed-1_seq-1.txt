ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIPT
OF INVITATION TO VIS
IT COLUMBUS.
SOUTUKUN TNII'
NOT YET I'LANNI-I)
Important Business May Keep
Chief Executive at Nation)
Capital Indefinitely.
A letter haa brtn received by the
local Chamber of Commerce in which
President Wiln graciously thank
the organization for the invitation re
cently extended him to include Co
lumbus in the itinerary of any trip
which he may make through the
south for the purpose of addressing
the people on the question of pre
paredness for war.
The letter is from Private Secre
tary Tumulty, and in addition to
conveying the thank of the Presi
dent for the invitation states that
while no plana for a southern trip
have as yet been made, that, should
the Chief Executive decide to make
the journey, careful consideration
will be given Columbus in the formu
lation of his itinerary.
It ia known that the resignation
of Hon. Lindley Garrison as secre
tary of war and other events which
have recently taken place will serve
to keep President Wilson in Wash
ington for an indefinite period, but
he may decide to make the southern
trip later, and in the event that he
reaches this conclusion it Is not im
probable that Columbus will be in
cluded in his route. According to
Washington press dispatches, he is
exceedingly anxious for the people
of the south to hear what he has to
say about preparedness, and his con- j
gtituents in, this section are equally
anxious to Haten. tnbj'.. atternpcfs
the- subject.
- In addition to the letter sent to
the White House, Hon. T. J. Locke,
Jr., vice-president of the Chamber of
Commerce, wrote a personal letter
to Attorney-General Gregory, who is
closely related to him by ties of
both affinity and friendship, in
which he urges that gentleman to do
everything in his power to induce
President Wilson to include Colum
bus in whatever plans he may make
for a southern trip. Mr. Locke was,
however, absent from the city yes
terday, ai d it was therefore im
possible to ascertain whether or not
he has received a reply to his letter
to Gen. Gregory.
Two Small Fires.
Two fire alarms were turned in
Tuesday morning. The first was
from the Columbus Floral Com
pany about 12:30 o'clock. The blaze,
which is supposed to have started
from a furnace flue, was quickly ex
tinguished, the damage amounting
to about $25.00.
The second alarm at 11:30 o'clock
was from the home of Mr. Wallace
on South Fifth avenue. The ire
started from a chimney, the damage
being about $15.00.
Mr. -Earl B. Broome spent Sunday
afternoon with friends in West Point.

J. S. Howerton, of Lee, chairman;
Hon. Frank Robertson, of Pontotoc,
Hon.'R. E. L. Sutherland, of Pren

The committee from the House

There is no charge of mismanage

and the committees merely came
here on a visit of inspection. Mem
bers of both committees not only
made a thorough inspection of the
grounds and buildings but made a
careful examination of the books of
the institution. They were cordially
received by President Whitfield,
Secretary Gaston and other officials
of the college, and were afforded
every facility for carrying on their
work in an intelligent manner. The
members of the Senate committee
attended chapel Monday morning,
und four of the senators made short
talks. Several of the lawmakers also
took supper at the college Sunday
evening.
While the lawmakers were in Co
lumbus President Whitfield went
over with them the appropriation
bill which is soon to come up for
their consideration, and explained
the urgent need for every improve
ment sought , for therein. The im
provements contemplated include a
teachers home costing J 15,000, a
college farm costing' $10,000, an
annex to the hospital costing $7,500

Senator Striblinif stated to the

his time at Jackson hail been con-
sumed in lookng after the interests

'that the people of Columbus and

an appropriation sufficient to amply
cover not only the fisi al exwndi-
tures for' support and maintenance
but to provide needed improve
ments." When asked concerning the criti
cism made in various quarters be
cause the House and Senate had
passed such a small number of bills,
Senator Stribling said he considered
this criticism undeserved and un
timely. "Constructive legislation,"
said he, "is necessarily a slow process
and many important bills are now in
the hands of committees, the num
bers of hich have been displayed in
reporting on them through their
determination not to recommend
the .adoption of any measure until
thoroughly convinced of its merit.
Right along this line," continued the
Senator, "I can give you a specific
instance of where, at least one in
iquitous bill was killed by a commit
tee of which I am a member. This bill
had it been passed, would have nulli
fied the best features of the deposi
tors' guaranty law which was adopt
ed at the last session of the legisla
ture, and which I consider one of
the best laws upon our statute books,
as it has the effect of protecting cit
izens of moderate means against un
scrupulous financiers. It is, perhaps,
needless to state that the bill was ad
versely reported."

iliaiiiatiriilly for a verdict for hn
client and her children, while te-i'i-niony
deduced at the trial resulted
not only in the urrest of Mr. Mc
Clung on the charge of operating a
gambling room but in the urre.it of
fourteen young men on the accu.m
tion of playing cards for money
therein. The jury rendered a verdict
awarding the horse and buggy to
Mrs. Cockrell.
The property in dispute was sold
to Mr. McClung some time ago by
Mr. ('. K. Cockrell, husband of the
plaintiff, who sought to regain pos
session thereof on the ground that
it not only belonged to her but was
given to Mr. McClung in liquidation
of a gambling debt, which debts have
no legal standing in the courts of
Mississippi. The jury, accepted ,; this
view of the matter, and gave the
horse and buggy to Mrs. Cockrell.
Testimony deduced at the trial
tended to indicate that gambling
had been carried on at the defend
ant's place of business, and at the
conclusion of the hearing Mr. Mc
Clung was arrested on an affidavit
sworn out by Mrs. Cockrell charging
him with operating a gambling room
and playing cards for money, and
fourteen other young men whose
names had been mentioned during
the hearing of the case were also
arrested on the gaming charge.
These fourteen young men were ar
raigned before Justice Cummings,
and, upon entering a plea of guilty,
were fined $5.00 each.
Mr. McClung went to trial on the
charge of operating a gambling
room, and the jury, which was com
posed of Messrs. W. II. Duncan, Cur
roll Ilackliman, Alex. Spann, II. L.
Locke, Wiley Hanks, and Eugene
Foster, failed to agree. According to
nn unofficial statement five of the
jurors voted for acquittal, and it is
understood that the case against
Mr. McClung will not be pushed.
Mr. McClung was represented in
both cases by his father, Col. A. H.
McClung, and Mr. M. K. White,
while in the issue between him and
Mrs. Cockrell, the plaintiff was rep
resented by Messrs. Callaway ami
Storey. The jury which decided the
cuse was composed of Messrs. T.
Munger, Houston Durrett, J.
Perkerson, Frank Burleson, A.

promised his constituents that,
whenever possible, he would repre
sent the state at important prelim
inary trials, and in compliance with
this promise, he visited Caledonia
Tuesday and prosecuted the caso
against Mr. Odum.
Perhaps the most important wit
ness introduced by the state was
Mr. Charles Lollar, son of the gen
tleman who was killed. The witness
testifi'Ml tht his father went - to Mr.
Odum's home for the purpose of
prevailing upon him to leave his
plantation, and that a quarrel took
place. Witness declared that his
father left the place, but returned
in a few minutes, and the difficulty
was renewed, the shooting having
followed. He stated that Mr. Odum
fired the first shot and his father
then fired the bullet which found
lodgement in his adversary's leg. A
negro was placed on the stand and
on direc t examination told practical
ly the same story as told by Mr.
Lf liar, but upon being cross-ernm-ined
by Mr. Holmes became consid
erably confused and contradicted
h'm.-elf several times.
The defendant was placed on the
s:and, and swore that he shot Mr
!ollar in self-defense. He said that
after having once left his home Mr.
Lollar returned thereto, and fired at
'dm as he came around the house.
Defendant then, according to hii
testimony, procured his shot gun and
fired the fatal shot.
The case was eloquently argued
by the attorneys appearing therein
and alter having devoted only a few
minutes to consultation the justices
announced that they had decided to
hold Mr. Odum for the grand jury
and agreed to fix the amount of
bond ut $5,000.
