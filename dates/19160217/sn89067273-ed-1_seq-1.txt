AT CENTRAL! A
Officer Accused of Being Too Free
With His Gun.
Charges of first-degree murder
were filed Feb. 14 by Prosecuting At
torney W. M. Dinwiddle against W.
H. Baldridge, 60 years of age, City
-Marshal of Centralia, who on the
morning of that date shot and killed
Dr. J. Q. Cooper of Centralia.
Feeling ran high in Centralia when
the killing became known. Cooper
was a prominent physician, graduate
of St. Louis University, and at one
time a member of the football team
of that school. Baldridge is satyl to
have stopped Cooper when the doc
tor came down from his office at
5:45 a ,m. Friends of Baldridge
say Cooper and two other men had
spent the night In Cooper's office
drinking; that when Baldridge tried
to arrest him the physician resisted
and the shooting followed.
Those on the other side recall pre
vious trouble Baldridge has had in
making arrests and say he is N "too
quick with the gun."
Baldridge has held various offices
in Centralia for the last 12 years.
He will be arraigned Friday. 1
Cooper is survived by a widow
and three children, the oldest of
whom is eight years old.

MEXICO WOMAN WINS PRIZE
Mrs h'. Roy Ferris has a prize let
ter in the St. Louis Republic of Feb.
13. She has been able to help dis
pel the dilemma of the mother in the
Better Housekeeping Club. Mrs. Fer-.
ria's practical letter Is as follows:
"In a family where home sewing is
done for little children the greatest
economy in time, as well as money,
is to select a becoming dress pattern
for the little girl and model all her
season's dresses by it, differentiating
them by the trimmings and material.
By doing this we know exactly how
much cloth to buy, after the first
dress, therefore eliminating waste.
A touch of handwork on the collar,
cuffs or belt of these little dresses
gives distinction and saves
of buying trimmings."
expense
Democrats should cease abusing
each other. Quit knocking Bryan and
quit making faces at Wilson. You'd
knock. Abraham Lincoln and Orover
Cleveland If they were yet alive.
Yet Lincoln and Cleveland were pret
ty good fellows and served their
country with single and noble heart.

Tlmt Audrain Gets More From The
State Than She Pays.
1
Of the 115 political subdivision of
Missouri, Including the 114 counties
and the city of St. Louis, there are
but nineteen that contribute any
money whatsoever toward the sup
port of the state government accord
ing to the report from the State Au
ditor's books. Audrain county re
ceives more from the state than it
pays.
In 1915 Audrain county paid into
the state treasury $22,804.56; Au
drain receives from the state
$23,282.16, this makes the excess
paid Audrain $477.60.
There are 96 counties in this state
that draw money in excess of what
they pay into the state treasury
in taxes. The city of St. Louis paid
last year $1,439,373.43 in excess of
the money received from the state;
Jackson county paid in an excess of
$275,749.35; Buchannan county;
$33,329.47, and St. Louis County,
$77,437.34. The other counties on
the right side of the ledger paid
smaller amounts, that of Pettis
County being only $321.46.
Some of the richest and most pop
ulous counties are listed on the oth
er side of the account.
Jasper county, for instance, drew
lut $28,042.54 more from the state
treasury than it paid. The county
contributed $61,433.72 and drew out
$89,476.26. Texas county, which
paid in only a total of $8,523.75,

Would Save Missouri Millions of Dol
lars This Year.
Carefully conducted corn-germination
testa In Missouri this year may,
if properly followed up by an elimin
ation of those ears which are low la
vitality, make an increase of $11,273,
491 for the 1816 crop.
This amount is an estimate of the
average annual loss caused by the
use of untested seed corn in the State
during the last eight years, accord
ing to J. C. Hackleman of the Col
lege of Agriculture at Columbia. The
use of tested seed corn may make
the difference betwwen an 85 per
cent stand and a perfect one, or be
tween 25 and 28 bushels an acre at
gathering time.
Last year's wet season, slow ma
turity and late gathering of the crop
resulted In cribbing much corn be
fore it was ripe enough to make good
seed. The corn contained so much
water that it was almost sure to heat
an mold even If it were mature
enough to gather. The Missouri
farmer who selected seed carefully
ih the field and stored it properly
can make a big return now by his
increased crop or by selling the seed
i
to his neighbors who did not take
precautions last fall.
The task of testing seed corn for
Missouri's 7,282,617 acres Is not to
great when we remember the work
is divided among more than a quarter
of a million farmers. This means that
to plant the average man's 26.6 acres
only four or five bushels of tested
seed are needed. As it takes about
two hoars to test a bushel of seed
corn, ten hours' work by the average
Missouri farmer would usually result
in a differenue of $40 In his inrome,
or about $1.50 an acre net gain for
all the corn he plants.
The sand box or saw dust germl
nator consists of a box about 4 inches
deep and 30 inches square, with
about 2 inches of sand or sawdust in
the bottom to hold the moisture or to
keep water from standihg around the
corn. A piece of old sheeting that
will absorb moisture, but will not al
low it to stand on the surface, should
be stretched over the surface and
marked off into 2-inch squares. Put
six kernels from various parts of the
middle of each ear to be tested into
one of these squares. Cover the box
to preveht drying and keep it at
room temperature about 70 degrees
F. for 6 days, then find the ears
from which kernels failed to germi
nate, throw them into the feed box
and keep those that showed a good
strong test.
Something Different
At Pvirdy's
When remodeling the Store -last
fall I dug out of the base
ment 6 or 8 boxes of lamp
chimneys of all kinds. They
were left over from the balmy
days of using lamp. I have
them from the S-cent kind to
the ones we used to break
brick with which sold for S55c.
We would rather have the
money than the chimneys, so
are putting them at the price
