The itobert Minor of I.iii-oim- —I Amis Raemaekers of Amsterdam
—has done for newspaper reader*, in Holland what Minor's cartoons
in Tlie rimes and associated newspapers accomplished for tlie Ameri
can public.
Raemae-kers "ripped the brass buttons off the war" in much the
same manner as Minor is doing, copies of htß paper, the Amsterdam
Telegraaf, received in this country show.
One of the Dutch artist's most striking pictures is that at the
top, above—"The Children of the Lusitania." This early war picture
first spread his fame among artists outside his native Netherlands.
"Kreuzland, Kreuzland Ueber Alles!" (Crossland over all) U
the German title of the picture showing a road full of children
marching between rows of crosses and asking, in the sub-caption of
Raemaekers' drawing, "Where are our fathers lying?"
Another startling conception is the Dutchman's cartoon of "Mili
tarism," with the mailed figure, swinging a great battle ax at the
Christ on the cross: "1 crush whoever resists me!"

New Candidate
Out With Hot
Shot On City
Finances
Announcing his candidacy for
the Office of city controller, Wt_*i
Shoemaker of Tacoma, tor oeveral
years chief of the financial de
partment of the V. 8. government
in tlie Philippine!, threw a liomb-
•hell into tlie city hall today by]
offering bold criticism of the]
mi'tlip ii . of handling city fin
ance-.
Besides declaring that Ta
coma was paying almost
twice us mucli interest on
her bonded debt as any oth
er largo city on the I'acil'ic
Coast —a sum whlcb reaches
s|Uiiii I 100 yearly—Hhoeiuak
er showed where the city

"expert" assistance In ob
taining an appraisement of
the city light and water de
pa rtiiieuts.
"This auditor is doing work
which the city controller most
emphatically should do," sard
tlie tww candidate today.
"During* tlie time he works, lie
Is getting a hither salary than
Controller Meads. The city vir
tually lias been hiring two con
trollers."

Shoemaker shows (hat San

bomb (I debl of $1,000,000, does
not \fky more than .1 >,__ per cent
ion the loan. Tacoma is pay hit; I
per cent.
Bonded indebtedness of over a
million dollars will fall due in
Tacoma within four years, says
Slioeaiaker, with no adequate
provision for paying it, and no
consideration of a possible re
fund at a lower rate of interest.
Shoemaker is something of a
"dark horse" in the municipal
race. He lias never before en
tered politics.
Mayor Kawcdtt told the city
council today that Shoemaker
was one of tlie most competent
auditors In the I'nited States.
He is now in Tacoma because
i his father, Ward Shoemaker, ia
aged und quite ill.
Held High Post.
Shoemaker is a graduate of
Harvard, where he took a degree
after study of municipal effi
ciency, municipal government and
expert accounting, in the Philip
pine islands he worked himself
up from position of expert ac
countant to chief of the pro
vincial division. This department
handles yearly $»,000,000, and
maintains a balauce of $3,000,
--000.
Hisj home is in Tacoma.
"I tin not trying to create a
sensation, but as a result of my
study I>l' municipal affairs, I have
figures to show where Tacoma is
losing-thousands of dollars an-
Bually-through gross mismanage
ment," said Shoemaker today.
"I Relieve that I will be able
to savfe these thousands if 1 am
electetl. The position does not
pay me as much as my place in
the Philippines would, but 1 hive
to be .near my father, and I will
gladl.' do this work for Tacoma,
it the people want me."

[SELL BOOZEI
Even Some of Our City Dads Buy It
OLD OJSTOMERS iFAVORED
Isn't it odd ?
In the terrific rush of their daily work in the interest of the public,
our Tacoma cops appear to have overlooked a small matter which ought
to have been brought to their attention the first of the year.
Namely, a law enacted by the voters of the state once popularly
known as " Initiative No. ;>."
This statute .says it is illegal to sell intoxicating liquors.
The places where these liquors formerly Were sold were known as
saloons, we are told, and some of these quaint institutions are preserved
in all their antiquity to us today as soft drink parlors.
Some of the old time bartenders also are preserved to us in the form
of soft drink salesmen.
Some of them also are selling the quaint drink known as booze. Al
most exclusively to old customers, you know.
Now that's not right. It isn't fair.
We would not bring up Banquo's ghost like this, only the police
rer/ly ought tit know about it. And we can't understand why our high
up pity officials haven't told them of this unfortunate situation.
£or certain of these high-up officials are in the ranks of these
steady old customers. They have been buying booze of bartenders in
one-time saloons.
Strange they haven't said a word about it.
