LONDON", Feb. 15 Today's debate
in parliament on the air defense of
Great Britain was chiefly remarkable
for the frank admissions made by the
cabinet's spokesmen that the presort t
conditions are far from satisfactory.

Erzerum, Turkey's chief city in Ar

Heavy assaults by the Russians
against the long line of detached forts
pi meeting the city, lasting over a pe
riod of five days and described by
Grand Duke Nicholas, the Russian
commander-in-chief, as "unprecedent-
ed" have resulted in the capture of the '
fortress.
Unofficial reports early in the pres
ent month said the German Field Mar
shal von Der Goltz, with 80,000 men,
were besieged in the city with pro
visions for only a fortnight.

ered of great strategic importance.

The immediate effect of the Russian

for despite the roads, the country is
mountainous and there is still much

Dr. McCoy, reviewing his extensive
research work on the subject, told
the committee that not more than
five per cent of the people generally
were susceptible to leprosy.
"It is a disease of young persons,"
he continued, "developing chiefly be
tween the ages of 15 and 30 years
and an inexplicable feature is that
wherever it has been found, it exists
exactly in the ratio of two males to
one female,
The period of develop-
ment after exPure ranges from two
to thirty years, and living In a com-

Dl.; McCoy said his investigation
had dem0nstrated that leprosy was
not a blood disease and was not
hereditary, but that no one ever had
established definitely how the germ
was trangmitted.

proposing in all the addition of more

One would grant pensions to the

or more in the army, navy or marine
corps of the United States, either as
regulars or volunteers, during the war
with Spain or the Philippine insur

July 4, 1902. According to the house
pension committee, the prospect is
that there will be 10,000 claims under
this measure, requiring $1,500,000 the
first year, with a slight increase each
year for some years.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16. The sub
marine controversy with Germany
cannot be closed until the United
States has fully considered the pos
sible effect of the declared intention
of the Germanic powers to sink all
armed merchantmen of their enemies
without warning after February 29.
This announcement was made by
Secretary Lansing today instead of
the long expected annourcement of a
satisfactory settlement of the Lnsi
tania negotiations.
Perfected by months of negotiation,
the Lusitania agreement was pre
sented today by Count von Bernstorff,
the German ambassador, in a form
which would have been acceptable to
the United States had not the Ger
manic powers announced their deter
mination to regard armed merchant
ships of their enemies as warships.
The Lusitania agreement now will
not be accepted as finally satisfac
tory to the United States until Pres
ident Wilson and Secretary Lansing
hav'e decided whether any of its i
terms would be nullified by the prin
ciples of the new submarine cam- I
paign.

Government officials are afraid they
may find themselves at the point
where they stood in the first days of
the submarine crisis with the United '
States contending unreservedly fori
the principles of law and humanity in '
naval warfare and confronted with a
long series of diplomatic exchanges, j
the result of which they cannot forsee. j
Count von Bernstorff told Secretary
Lansing today that it was his per
sonal opinion that in the new subma
rine campaign, his government in
tended to abide by its promise not to
sink unresisting liners without warn
ing, given in the Arabic case and re
ferred to in the Lusitania agreement.
Mr. Lansing informed the ambassador
that such a declaration from his gov
ernment would be highly desirable.
The ambassador suggested the pos

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16. Cross ex
amination of Sidney W. Winslow,
president of the United Shoe Ma
chinery Company regarding his
charges of unprofessional conduct
against Louis D. Brandeis featured
the bearing today anil tonight before
the senate sub-committee investigat
ing Mr. .Brandeis' fitness for the su
preme court of the United States.
Early in the day the committee ac
cepted the services of G. W. Ander
son, district attorney of Boston, to
look after the interests of Mr. Bran
deis during the inquiry, inasmuch as
Austin G. Fox, of New York had been
sent to the hearing to represent A.
Lawrence Lowell, president of Har
vard University, and a group of Bos
ton attorneys opposed to Mr Bran
deis' confirmation.
In his examination of Mr. Winslow,
Mr. Anderson sought to show that
Mr. Brandeis had urged the United
S!-.oe Machinery Company to change
the "tying" clause in its leases be
fore suits were brought against it
by the government, and that he
severed all relations with the com
pany because Winslow refused to
change the leases.
Mr. Anderson introduced in evi
dence a pamphlet entitled "Brandeis
vs. Brandeis, the reversible mind,"
which the witness identified as one
his company had issued several years
ago. A long contention arose as to
the introduction and value of the
document. I'artial copies of the bill
book of the Brandeis law firm had
been introduced previously sbowing
that the firm handled only two cases
for the machinery company after
.Brandeis resigned as director of the
company. Turning to one page of the
pamphlet, Mr. Anderson read the
statement that "it appeared in spite
of his quickened conscience, Mr.
Brandeis continued to act as counsel
for the company for three years after

"Do you think that a fair State

ficial announcements from the ad
miralty, which the .British censors had
passed for publication In England.
Mr. Daniels explained that censors
had acted under the existing regula
tions, drafted by a board of naval of
ficers after an exhaustive study of
the question of radio censorship, and
prohibiting the transmission into this
country of any message referring to
"movements or locations of war or
other vessels of the belligerents." The
object of the regulation, he said, was
to prevent violations of neutrality by
the admission of dispatches contain
ing information' of a military value
which might he used by agents of a
belligerent nation in this country.
In cases of the information coming
officially from a foreign government
and also printed in the territory or
an enemy country, the secretary said
he believed the prohibition could be
removed. The subject will be called
to the attention of the naval board
tomorrow.
