"He'll Go in WiuTa Whoop" if
;He Keeps Up.Prhportionate
Gains, Says George Miller j
i "In tlie. laat 60 . days Middle-West
eeBUment has' turned toward Roose
velt tery strongly. It t eonUnuea tq
dacKe proportionately between now
rnd presidential election time, lie will
go in with & whoop, so far as the Middle-West
Is concerned."
This Is how George Miller, chair
man of the senate committee on priv
ilegee and election, and the committee
on manufactures, of the Wisconsin
state legislature, and member of the
state senate from the 26th district, in
which Madison, the capital, his home
city, is located, today summarized the
presidential outlook In his home state.
So far as Wisconsin sentiment
goes. Senator La Follette will have
the delegation to the national conven
tion, but that delegation will be pro-nooeevelt.-
said Mr. Miller this morn
ing at: the Alexander Young, where
he is staying with his family, seeing
the Islands and delighted with them.
Mind you. there is no alliance be
tween La Follette and Roosevelt,
though. We're going to give La Fol
lette our vote, even though we don't
' think he Stands any chance of getting
the nomination",
Eager For Preparedness.
Talking about preparedness, Mr.
Miller says, -Wisconsin wants It with
a big P." He says his state Is most
emphatically In favor of national de
fense and that. TitUens. committees
have been formed in the principal cit
ies to act on their own initiative in
outlining . plans for state prepaicd-
" ness.. - .
"We are doing preliminary "work in
the schools, he said. "Military train
ing has been made much more strin
gent In the University of Wisconsin,
and we ere just starting in with the
high schools. Military instruction
and drills are . to be made a part
the curriculum."
Thst Wisconsin is prosperous was
stated by Mr. Miller, who says war
orders and big prices for agricultural
products have made the state more
prosperous than tn many years, Tl.a
r Allis-Chalmers Milwaukee plant, an'l
Glsholt Machine Company of Madison
are working night and day on war or
ders, the latter turning out turret
lathes to ship abroad for the Allies'
munition factories."
"Why don't you ask me something
a Lout your islands?" he then added. ' 1
think they are lovely, and I wish now I
, could stay longer than April 1. We're
V going over to see Kilauea volcano this
afternoon. ' It seems strange to rad
that they're having zero weather back
