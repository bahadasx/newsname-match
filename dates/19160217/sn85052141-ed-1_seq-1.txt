I 0. ENGINEERS HERE TO
NOTE FLOOOD CONDITIONS.
Mr. Hoar, of the eivil enjri
necriiiK corjm of the Illinoia Cen
tral railroad, waa her' Friday
looking over tho 0. M. & U. Ky.
property, which waa hard hit by
the r ut overflow in Weal
BTlOMMn, with a view to roport
irr to his -ompaiiy coueoruiiHf
the e.Vtellt of wllieh they should
cooperate in building a city
levee. Our information is that
he would not recommend eontri
hittiiitf aa much aa $8,00, which
Mai thought by Pres. Peyton, of
the N. C. & St. L. liy., aa being
an priiablc portion for the 1.
C. His op in am that tho total
'ot ot the levee, eatitMXod at
ti-Ni.thKi, wji too high, hut vondi
tioiiM prevented him from frettirur
such informal ion aa would en
enable him to arrive at anything
like correct fiirurea. It ia the
once uhiw of opinion that tho 1.
C. will, however, lo williinf lo
contrihut4 any reaaoitahle amount
to prevent a repetition of this
y oar's dwaater.

HEAD OF KY. MASONRY
WILL VISIT HICKMAN.
Grand Master Adams, of tho
Grand Lodge of Kentucky, will
l isit Hickman on Monay, April
17th, as the guest of Hickman
liodjre No. 761, P. & A. M. In a
way, this will be a distinct honor
for tho local blue lodge, aa never
before in the history of the State
h.as a presiding grand master been
the guest of this lodge. Mr.
Adams is also superintendent of
th- Widows' and Orphan's home,
at LnVjiaMUe, one of Kentucky's
grewt ajMMMFMff institutions.
Wo note with pleasure ( T) tliat
insurance rates in certain local ter
ritorj have ipiiotly advanced from
1.!8 to $2.20. No additional
h.i-irds no ex. use just aimidy
a little gouge. The State Hoard
is blamed, but we have failed to
hoar of the companicti trying to
enjoin die board. There ia
something radically wrong with
the insurance business in Ken
tucky. We pay practioally twice
the rat,- barged in most States,
'nit we doubt seriously that Ken
tucky has twice as many firm as
other States. Hickman stands for
a heavy rate because our fire
protection is inadequate. We
shall note carefully the revision
of nib-A after our new fire en
gine is installed. Our business
men have Mjieiit a wad of money
during the past two years re-wir-iinr
for electricity to protect the
iusiiri'iice companies, primarily
and still the rates well, what's
the iwet
The local relief committee "sat
up and took notice'' last week
when it roaeived two bills for
brand from the Martin Bakery,
which has been supplying brea I
for refugees, one bill for $11 and
another for $77; whereaa, the
I committee was under the inipres
.8Mn the bread was being given
gratis. The matter was taken Up
with J. T- Perkins, who origi
nally suggested the, shipment of
broad in this ease, ami he in
fonniHl the committee that there
ils no charge to be made against
the i-oinmittce for bread, but tliat
Martin oMaMM were Ix'aring the
expi us- II L. A m berg, had a
reiuly jiaid the $11 iwcount before
tlie i'acts were ascertained.
