We note in the Duluth Herald
that Duluth has three citizens, Judge
J. D. Ensign, Mr. and Mrs. T. J.
Watt, who haye had personal inter­
views with Abraham Lincoln. We
also pride ourselves that George H.
Durfee met Abraham Lincoln on se­
veral occasions, the first being in
1860 in Illinois and cast his first
vote for him at that time. He was
also present when Abraham Lincoln
made his immortal "Gettysburg Ad­
dress", standing within twenty feet
of him during the address. He also
heard him and spoke to him several
times during the following years.
He was the holder of a complimen­
tary ticket to Fords Theatre on the
night of the assassination of Abra­
ham Lincoln but was unable to at­
tend.
