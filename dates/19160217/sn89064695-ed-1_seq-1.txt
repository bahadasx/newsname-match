SUBSCRIPTION S1.50 PER YEAR IN ADVANCL
A delegation from Red Lake
Reservation is now at Washington
to discuss with the Indian Com
mittees of Congress the Nelson
7: \X- ii people of the
Red Lake bill to create a forestry
-p, the question in each county,
reservation upon the Red .Lake
Reservation. From the stand
point of the Indians the bill is an
outrage to their rights that it
aims to take from them the homes
the oldest of them have lived in
since their births, and which cheir
parents lived in before them, and
also their gardens.
Some frieuds of C. A. Oongdon
of Duluth, who reside at St. Paul
and Minneapolis, have suggested
that he should be urged to be
come a candidate for the republi
can nomination of governor of
Minnesota. Others have suggest
ed that if the republicans win at
the next presidential election that
he should be pushed forward as
Minnesota's candidate for a cab
inet position. Mr. Congdon's
friends say that besides being one
of the ablest attorneys in this
state he is one of its best business
men, and thai fcts~ex^erTence as an
attorney and business man would
enable him to deal successfu'ly
with the questions of the day that
besides this he is not only a high
grade man but likewise a consci
entious one.
Last week', before the Indian
committee, we are informed, Sen.
Clapp of the committee discussed
strongly in favor of referring to
the Court of Claims the Sioux
claims for annuities, and in these
discussions did not hesitate to
state that attorney's fees at ten
per cent of the amount which they
might recover was a most reason
able compensation. He also said
that because some Sioux took the
war path fifty years ago there was
no justification in depriving all the
Sioux the annuities to which they
were clearly entitled under treaty
stipulations for lands they had
ceded. Senator Clapp was right,
for many of the Sioux even
fought against hostile members of
the tribe. Sitting Bull and his
band fought the United States
years, but many other Sioux were
not made to sutler the loss of their
treaty rights on this account the
South fought against the
North during the same time as the
Minnesota Sioux did in 1862, and
the South did not los3 any of its
rights by so doing, so that these
precedents should be followed in
the Sisseton and Wahpeton Sioux
claims for annuities.-
Could Not Get The Treaty
OfIS
Congressman Chipperfield made
a strong effort to try and get the
provisions of the treaty of 1855,
which prevents the sale of mtoxi
cants within a crtain portion of
this* state, amended so that the
special officers would confine their
work to Indian locrvations, and
to aNo present them from seirch
ino- the baggage, homes and effects
of anyone without search war

the contention of Mr. Chipperfield
to some extent and said in an ad

Washington than had ever been

The amendment was lost and
Mr. Miller then offered another

How The Fund Will Be
Paid.
The following amendment has
been placed into the Indian appro
pnation bill now pending in Con
gress, and unless Senator Clapp
can secure its amendment, it is
quite probable that the Indian
office and superintendents ll
hold up many of the persons whom
they do not Jike, or use the fund
as the means of coercing many of
them to yield to unfair treatment:
"That the Secretary of the In
terior, under such rules and regu
lations as he may prescribe, is
hereby authorized to advance to
any individual Chippewa Indian in
the State of Minnesota entitled to
participate in the, Dermanent fund^
of the Chippewa Indians of Minne
sota one-fourth of the amount
which would now be coming to
said Indian under a pro rata dis
tribution of said permanent fund:
PROVIDED, That the Secretary
of the Interior, under such rules
and regulations as he may pre
scribe, may use for or advance to
any Chippewa Indian in the State
of Minnesota entitled to share in
siid fund who is blind, crippled,
decrepit, or helpless from old age,
disease, or accident, one-fourth of
the amount which would now be
coming to said Indian under a pro
rata distribution of said permanent
fund: PROVIDED further, That
any money received hereunder by
any member of said tribe or used
for his or her benefit shall be de
ducted from the share of said
member in the permanent fund of
the said Chippewa Indians in Mm

be entitled: PROVIDED further,
That no funds paid hereunder to
Indians shall be available for pay

According to advices from a

Indian Contention Sus
tained
Whatever have been the failures
of Burch and Daniels in the White
Earth land cases, Attorney Pike,
of the Kearful force, has recently
obtained a very important decision
from Judge Morris, of the United
States district court, relative to
th taxation of allotments held by
mixed-bloods which have not been
alienated that is of great import
ance to the allottees.
Since the passage of the Clapp
Act and after the failure of the
House of Representatives of the
legislature of this state to pass the
Dar S. Hall bill after he had se
cured its passage by the Senate,
THE TOMAHAWK has contended in
a number of its issues that allot
ments still held by allottees could
not be legally taxed. The Morris
decision sustains this contention of
THE TOMAHAWK, ai.d now the
counties of Mahnomen, Becker
and Clearwater wilt have to re
fund the taxes which they have
collected illegally from many- of
the mixed-blood adottees. In this
connection another question will
now confront the allottees many
of whom mortgaged their lands
for the purpose of paying the
taxes the counties compelled them
to pay. Whether a mortgage,
which is an agreement to alienate
lands under certain conditions,
Would come within the purview of
alienated lands and are therefore
taxable, is another question which
may have to be settled in the
courts.
The force of the Department of
Justice which is now looking after
the White Earth land suits is com
posed of attorneys of ability, and
not of mere politicians as hereto
fore. It is not probable that they
will take a more active part in the
factional fights of the Indians of
the Chippewas reservations of
Minnesota than to their duties of
prosecuting the alleged land frauds
upon this reservation.
Open All Indian Reser
vations.
Every other section of land up
on all Indian reservations should
be open to white farmers who
should become actual settlers up
on the reservation, by sale by al
lottees, and if net allottees by
sale under special laws which
would require the purchasers of
the land to themselves go upon
and cultivate them.
Experience upon this reserva
tion under the Clapp Act has
shown what Commissioner Luepp
said was intended only as an ex
periment, that it has proved to be
a success. The white farmers
have done more towards teaching
the incompetents to become self
supporting in the way the govern
ment has tried to do than could
have been accomplished in fifty
years although the act has been in
force only since 1906.
It has been the experience-of
the Chippewas that although some
times some farmers have taken a
slight
Indian office seems to
ba kf*pt busy transferring him
from one reservation to another.
It would be to the credit of the
office if it would transfer Mr.
Daniels out of the service entirely

pewa leservations should be open
ed to settlement, and that allot
ments should be made upon re
served sections. In this way the
Indians would have been thrown
in direct contact with experienced
farmers and a good class of people.
The Chippewas should try and
have a bill passed by Congress
which would permit the allottees
on every other section to sell thpir
allotments of land under condi
tions that would require the im
mediate cultivation of the lands
sold, and some inducement should
be made to get experienced farm
ers only to buy these lands. Spec
ulation in these lands, if a bill
such as suggested should be passed,
should not be permitted by the
law. C. C, Daniels May Prac

C. C. Daniels, recently deposed
from the position of chief prose
cutor in the White Earth land
suits, has informed acquaintances
in Washington that he expects to
sever his connections with the
government service entirely and
come to Minneapolis and practice
law there. Should he do this there
would be three ex-members of the
Department of Justice who were
brought into this state by the land
cases, who would be practicing
law within the state, namely: Mr.
Lofig, now at Pine City, GordaD
Cain now at Minneapolis, and Mr.

The Red Lake Forestry
Reservation Bill.
Congressman Steenerson, at the
request or Senator Nelson, recent
ly presented to the Indian commit
tee of the House the Nelson Red
Like biil to create a forestry res
ervation upon the Red Lake Res
ervation, but the committee re
fused to put it upon the Indian
appropriation bill as requested by
Mr. Steenerson.
The Red Lake bill does not
effect any of the Chippewas of
Minnesota except the Red Lake
band, and if it should become a
law the members of th.it band
would practically lose their homes
and improvements.
If the Red Lake Indians do not
wish to allow their rights to go by
default they should commence
without delay suits to compel the
Department of the Interior to al
lot them the lands for which many
of them have filed applications
several years ago under existing
laws.
It would be a great injustice to
the Red Like Indians to create a
forestry reservation upon the Red
Lake Reservation, and a violation
of the agreements made with
them, and especially to sell the
pine timber of the reservation in
the manner proposed.
It is an open secret to Northern
Minnesota that the object of the
proposed reservation is to allow
the pine timber to be cut as dead
and down timber, which every
person of experience in timber
matters knows would be against
the interests of the Indians.

POLITICIAN CLAIM LIO IS POLITICAL
MOVE.
That the Northern part of Min
nesota, embriced in the territory
covered by the Indian treaty of
183."), should be afflicted with the
name "Indian country," is becom
ing more intolerable every day, is
shown in the expressions of busi
ness men and others who are in
terested in the progress of that
section of the state. .During the
recent Democratic state confer
ence in this city, A. C. Schmidt, a
delegate from Crookston, explained
conditions by saying that the en
forcement of the Indian treaty,
forgotten for fifty yeurs, is noth
ing more or less than a political
move. In an interview published
in the Minneapolis Tubune, he
said that the so-called lid is not
only a cm so to the section affected,
but to all Northern Minnesota.
"People who do not know con
ditions there," he said, "take it
for granted that the country is a
wild, frontier, sort of place, and
as few people want to pioneer it
under conditions which they read
about in dime novels and depicted
in wild west shows, they are not
likely to become interested in
Northern Minnesota. With the
exception of one little section, an
Indian hasn't been seen, except as
a curiosity, in the entire territory
affectedly the federal lid."St.
