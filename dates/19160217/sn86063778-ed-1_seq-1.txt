"Old" Mary Parks.
More than fifty years ago Mary
Parks and her babe. Eliza, made
their appearance in Union, Mecklenburg
and other counties in j
North Carolina. They lived on !
whatever anyone saw fit to give ;
them but would not beg. They j
traveled through-the woods and
slept in old houses and barns, j
Carrying a small bundle of dry ,
goods tied up in a rag. As we
remember them Eliza was a
cripple, one leg being shorter
than the other. The story is
that her mother let her fall out
of a tree when she was an infant.
crippling her for life.
Mary was afraid of dogs and
one day as she was passing by a
house a dog made after her and

ing she let Eliza fall.
Mary had become estranged
from her family and was an exile
from the paternal roof. She had
seen hotter days. Because the
hand of misfortune had smitten
her she had become a floating
wreck driven by every breeze.
The doors of mercy were shut
against her. She sought revenge
in the life of a "virago."
She had evidently had some
culture in her youth as she always
carried a bible in that
little bundle and frequently referred
to its teachings.
She vanished from the Carolinas
in 1860 and did not return
until after the Civil war. She
spent her vacation in Florida and
was not seen during the war,
but soon afterwards re-appeared.
"Lize" was now grown and soon
a son was born to her. She
named him King David. Thus
was added to the little band
another member. As time went
on they still traveled from pillar
to post killing snakes and cussing
everybody that had dogs. The
very name Mary Parks made the
youngsters shudder. She would

needs. After hard persuasion
she succeeded in getting Mary
to relinquish her tramp life and
they rented a small house near
Stouts, in Union county. It was
here that Mary gave up her commission
as a tramp after more
than fifty years service. She
died, being past her three score
years and ten mark.
Thus the most noted band of

was disbanded. Lize with

FORT MILL, S. C., THE
FORT MILL GASES
BEFORE YORK COURT
In the case of A. E. Sutton vs.
Catawba Power Co., the jury
rendered a verdict for the plaintiff
for $500. This is a case
involving some interesting legal
points. Sutton recovered a verdict
several years years ago for
$1,500 against the same de
rendant for damages to this same
land. It is alleged that the
waters of Catawba river backed
over the land, due to the con-1
struction of the Catawha Power j
Co's. dam. The defendant
sought to defeat recovery in the
present case upon the theory
that the former recovery was a
bar to any subsequent recovery,
but the plaintiff won out on the
theory that the former suit was
not for, and did not include,
prospective damages, but only
i damages that had accrued up to
the suit, then litigated. The
jury in the last case remained
! out all night, and a mistrial
seemed certain, but after receiving
further instructions from
| the court, soon rendered the
! above verdict.
C. Cook vs. Singer Sewing
Machine company was a trial
that attracted considerable interest.
The plaintiff sued for
damages, alleging that the agents
; of the Singer Sewing Machine
Co. entered his home during his
absence and took therefrom a
sewing machine. The defendent
sought to defeat recovery,
and set up several defenses, alleging
that it took the machine
under a past due chattel mortgage,
and that Cook gave it
leave to enter his home some
time previously, and also that a
very small child gave these
agents leave to enter Cook's
home, and take possession of
. the machine. Cook denied hav:
ing executed the chattel mortgage,
ai d claimed to have paid
the debt in full. The jury found
for the plaintiff in the sum of
$750. This verdict included $250
actual damages, and $500 puni
! live damages.
Miss Olive Perry vs. Mrr.
ft'. A. Miller was another case in
which much interest centered.
The plaintiff alleged that she
loaned Mrs. Miller about $300,
j and brought suit to recover this
! sum. Mrs. Miller denied liability
and alleged that Miss Perry
owed her this sum. and more, on
; account of board, etc. The case
i was hard fought by both sides.
The jury decided that Mrs. Miller
should return Miss Perry's
| money.
Will Not Seek Re-Election.
"I will not seek re-election in
the primaries this summer," said
ni nr* TV i ^ ?
onenri nugn <i. Brown a few
davs ago to a reporter for the
Yorkville Enquirer. "I like the
work of the sheriff all right?
in fact, I like it better than any
work that I have ever done, but |
the idea of having to live at the
jail where my growing familv
necessarily comes in more or less
contact with prisoners confined
there, is distasteful to me and
for that reason I will not seek
the office again."
News of the fact that Sheriff
Brown will not seek re-election
will come as a surprise to many
people who have had no other
idea than that he would again
seek the place.
He has held the office of
sheriff for twelve years, succeeding
ex-Sheriff John R.
Logan in 1904. He has conducted
the office in a very
satisfactory manner and has
ever proved a capable and
efficient official.

working on the case ever since '
the body was found, more than
a month ago. He discovered
that the prisoner had threatened

home. Also that Taylor has

NOUN, NOTED "YEGG,"
AGAIN UNDER ARREST
Thomas Nolan, better known
to officers all over the country,
and particularly to the officers of
this state, as "Chicago" Nolan,
has been placed in jail in Maryland,
charged with safecracking,
according to press despatches.
Accounts say that a safe was dynamited
at St. Michael. Md.t just
outside Baltimore, and as the
yeggmen were attempting to escape
in an automobile they encountered
an open draw-bridge
and were captured. Nolan being
among those taken.
It will be remembered that in
Aprill 1915, Nolan was to be
tried before a York county jury
on the charge of having blown
the safe of the Savings Bank of
Fort Mill some ten years before.
He was given a preliminary hearing
before Magistrate Harris in
this city and was committed to
York jail to await tial. Whin
the case was called, however,
the charge was not pushed and
against Nolan and the case wis
placed upon the contingent
docket of York county and Nolan
released "duringgood behavior."
The prisoner gave out the statement
before leaving York to the
effect that he intended becoming
a better man.
Nolan spent several months in
the York county jail and during
the time he was held there a
wholesale delivery of prisoners
was attempted. Several did get
away nut. Nolan refused to go
and when the alarm was sounded,
officers, upon their search of
the jail, found him deeply buried
in a Bible.
