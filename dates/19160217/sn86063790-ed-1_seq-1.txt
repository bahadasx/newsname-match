Ehrhardt Etchings.
Ehrhardt, Feb. 15.?The balmy
6pring-like weather was driven away
last Monday by a high northwesterly
wind, and we are having real win-!
N
ter again. Some fruit trees had on
a full suit of blooms and unless protected
some way will lose all their
fruit for this season.
Several of our auto owners are
contemplating a move for good roads,
and think that the best way to make
a start is to call a meeting at the i
court house (Bamberg) and form an |
auto club for good roads; take a pub-i
lie subscription, appoint officers and i
get down to business; as the average
road in this section is not fit for a
team of oxen, let alone for one to
go out in his car. We are not stepping
on any one's toes or putting any
blame on anyone, but want to be'
"helpers."
Mr. Louis Hiers, of Hampton, is'
I
having erected on his lot that he!
k purchased from Mr. Jacob Ehrhardtj
last year, a handsome brick store, 30!
feet front by 85 feet deep. Mr. I
I
Knopff, of Fairfax, is the contractor j
in charge. This lot is a desirable lo-j
cation for a store, being opposite the'
Farmers & Merchants Bank. When i
f finished it will be occupied by Mr. I
r i
Hiers and his sons, doing a general
mercantile business.
Messrs. J. W. McKenzie and R.
Ehrhardt enjoyed an auto spin out
to Crocketville and Ashton last Sunday
in the "Yankville Grocery company's"
car.
H Several auto parties are planning;
to visit Orangeburg Thursday eve|
and get a peep at the "Pink Lady,"|
if the weather is permissible.
Mrs. X. J. Stuart, who lives with
her daughter, Mrs. H. Ehrhardt, and
Miss Mvrtie Stafford, who has been
on an extended visit to her sister,1
Mrs. John Hartz, left a few days ago
for their former homes at Canton,
Ga.
Mr. H. Karesh is preparing to open
a millinery store in town. He will,
, occupy the store house that Mr. O. |
E. Kearse occupied last year, Mr. i
Kearse having moved to McKenzie
Bros.' store the first of the year. For
the past two years the town has had
no store to accommodate the ladyj
folks, and they had to patronize,
other places.
Mr. and Mrs. Karesh left Sunday;
to visit New York and Baltimore and
to buy up a stock of goods.
Some folks must not believe in1
preparedness: therefore let this cold
weather catch them without coal or,
wood. JEF.

PI T POISON IN SOI P. I
; 1
Kitchen Employee Missing After Dinner
(iiven in Honor of Bishop. ?
Chicago, Feb. 12.?Virulent poison ;
was found today by city chemists in j ^
[Samples of the soup served at the j
j banquet in honor of Archbishop MunI
delein at the University Club Thurs
day night. The discovery, coupled j
with the disappearance of a kitchen i
employee of the club and the finding j j
of similar poison in a private labora-1 c
| tory in his room, together with
literature classed as anarchistic, led j
the police to believe that the illness |
which overcame more than a hun-j
dred of the diners was the result of a
deliberate attempt to poison the
guests.
The nature of the poison discover- A
ed and fear that perhaps a slow acti
(
j ing poison had also been mingled j
with the banquet viand prompted the ]
city health commissioner, Dr. John i c
Robertson, to issue a warning to all 1
i who attended the banquet to place 1
i themselves immediately under the
care of a physician.
Several of the distinguished guests c
were so affected that they-^have not 1
vet recovered. Two are still con- c
fined to their beds, and a number of c
others today said that they still felt g
the effects of the poisonous soup.
JliOV ,
Archbishop Mundelein was not af-j t
fected. He ate very sparingly of the j (
soup. The absence of Jean Crones, j ^
assistant chef, at the club was noted; j
by the manager, H. J. Doherty, and j
his suspicions were aroused. With <5
a policeman he went to Crones's room
and there discovered the laboratory (
and found poison flasks.
Crones, according to the club officials,
was employed last September, (
and was fond of discussing economic ?
c
questions and was said to have often
inveighed against the present order ^
of society with its stratas of rich and ^
poor. In the room which he had occupied
the* police said they found
many volumes, by anarchistic authors,
explosives and weapons, in ad- ^
dition to the poison vials. He was
said by the police to have come to
Chicago from St. Louis and his description
was sent to various cities. s
Among the guests at the banquet t
who were affected by the poison were c
prelates, judges, bankers, noted phy- $
sicians, representative business men j.
and manufacturers prominent in the t
affairs of the city and nation. <:

Senate Votes for Alternative Amendment
in Changing Law.
Columbia, February 9.?Every resident
of South Carolina may order
two quarts of whiskey or five dozen
bottles of beer each month for per-j
sonal use, according to the terms of j a
bill which passed the senate tonight
and was sent to the house. The senate
this morning had cut the allowance
of whiskey from one gallon to c
one-half gallon a month, and tonight, I \
despite strenuous objection from the t
prohibition leaders, adopted an i
amendment, by Senator Hughes, per- c
mitting the alternative of five dozen j ^
bottles of beer per month. The first ] 1
effort of the prohibitionists was made 1 t
on a motion to table the Hughes ^
amendment, which motion was lost i
by a vote of 19 to 21. The prohibi- t
tionists forced another roll call on (
the adoption of this amendment, \
which passed by a vote of 23 to 19.

Manning. Feb. 9.?An interesting
ase, decidedly out of the ordinary,
vas up for a hearing before Magistrate
J. W. Heriot Saturday. A white
nan. who lives in the Deep Creek
;ection, near Bloomville, had a negro I
i
ivroctpri nn ?i tpr-linioal rharae of ma-!
icious mischief, to wit, cutting off
;he tail of a valuable pointer dog.
iVhen the case came up for trial the
legro pleaded guilty and was sen;enced
to pay a fine of S3.00, which
mded the case without going into
;he full details of the matter.
It seems from outside reports,
vhieh did not come to the knowledge
)f the court, that the negro knew the
lualities of the dog in question and
greatly coveted his possession. All
efforts to persuade the dog to take
ip his abode- at his house proved of
:io avail, so the negro decided to resort
to a "conjure" trick that
promised sure success, and that was
;o cut off a portion of the dog's tail
md bury it near his house. Those
Alio have studied and understand
conjuring tricks say that if any one
:loesn't believe it, it is simply be?ause
they never tried it.

tion ISefore Committees.
Washington, Feb. 12.?The proposals
o the National Guard association
for federalization of the State
troops were before the military cominittcioc
f>nturrocc in 1 ho t'nrni
in i \J I v twuu; *11 iiiv. *??
of a bill drafted by representatives of
the association at the request of the
senate committee. The regulations
contemplated are given force by a
provision limiting participation in
the federal pay feature to officers,
men or organizations complying with
certain specified requirements.
The scale of annual pay proposed
is as lollows: Major generals. $800;
brigadiers, $700; colonels, $000;
lieutenant colonels, $550; majors,
$525; captains, $500; first lieutenants,
$300; second lieutenants, $250.
Enlisted men would be paid on the
basis of 25 per cent, of the pay rates
of the regular army, a guard private
receiving approximately $45 a year.
The maximum number of National
Guard troops provided for by the bill
is 500 for each , congressional district,
or a total peace strength of approximately
200,000, an increase of
70,000. This would form a separate!
branch of the regular army in time
of war. The act would take effect
July 1, 1916.
The bill provides also for organization
of a junior guard, composed of
boys between 12 and 18.
Knlistment Contract.
An enlistment contract would be j
required, under which the soldier
would bind himself to serve the federal
government ."within or without
the continental limits of the United
States" for a period of two years, or
until discharged, should the guard be
called out at any time during his |
three-year enlistment period. The
enlistment period of any soldier
whose time was close to expiration
when his regiment was called out
would be extended automatically.
It is proposed to do away with
choice of officers by election. Commissions
would be limited to specified
classes and granted only after
examinations by the war ^department.
Promotions during active service
would be made by the president from
within the organization.
At least forty-eight drills a year
and participation in annual field manoeuvres
would be required.

Members of both the senate and'
house committees who had looked!
over the measure said tonight that it
would require radical amendment, in
their opinion, before it would be acceptable
to congress. It will be discussed
section by section next week
by the house committee.
Members of both committees have j
displayed keen interest in reports I
reaching them that 30,000 profes-!
sional men, students and others already
had been enrolled to take a|
month of intensive military training
this summer at civilian camps. The
committees have been informed that
more than 100,000 men can be secured
for training if some financial aid
were given to those willing to spend
a month annually at military education.
SECRETARY GARRISON RESIGNS.
War Cabinet Officer Quits His Post
of Duty.
Washington, Feb. 10.?Secretary
Garrison resigned today because
President Wilson would not irrevocably"
support the continental army
plan, and because the secretary of
war opposes the administration's
programme of setting a definite time
for Philippine independence.
Prociriont Wilson accented the
1 1 V^OlUVlib ? ? 4
resignation and has not selected a!
successor. The president himself I
probably will take personal charge
of the administration's national de-1
fence plans in congress.

also resigned as a mark of loyalty to j
his chief, whose view he shares. The'
president accepted his resignation, j
Both take effect immediately. .Major
Gen. Scott, chief of staff of the army, j
automatically becomes secretary of
war ad interim.
It is known that one of Secretary
Garrison's principal reasons for his i
conviction that only a federal coini-j
nental army, instead of a reorganiz-j
ed National Guard, could be the main!
military dependence of the nation
was his belief that some day the
United States may be called upon to
defend the .Monroe doctrine, and in
that event he foresaw that the

President Willin?? to Servo the Peo-[
pie if There is a Popular Demand
for His Nomination.
Washington, Feb. 14.?President
Wilson today consented formally for
the first time to tlie use of his name
as a presidential candidate fn the)
coming campaign. At the same time
lie declared he was entirely unwilling
to enter into any contest for renomination.
This definition of the president's
attitude, in line with the plans of his
political asosciates, is expected to1
bring into the open the campaign be-|
ing made in his favor throughout the
country.
Mr. Wilson's declaration was made]
in a letter to the Ohio secretary of!
State, who had written that candi-j
dates for delegates 'Torn that State to j
the national convention must signify!
their choices for president bv Febru-i

ary 25 and that no presidential can-;
didates could be named in that con-!

In several other States, of which
no such requirements are imposed,
Mr. Wilson's name already has been
placed on primary ballots, and his
friends generally have taken it for
granted that he would be a candidate
if convinced there was any considerable
popular demand for it.
The letter the president enclosed
was as follows:
"While I am entirely unwilling to
enter into any contest for the presi-j
dential nomination of the Democratic'
party, I am willing to permit the use
of my name that the Democrats in
Ohio may make known their preference
in regard to that nomination.
"In order, therefore, to satisfy the
technical requirements of the statechnical
requirements of the statutes
of the State of Ohio, I hereby
candidate for the presidency by any
candidate who seeks to be elected a
delegate to the National Democratic
convention which is to assemble in
June next."

for the arrest of the guilty person.
with evidence to convict. J. A.

Khett I Resident.
Charleston, Feb. 12.?.Mr. R. Goodwyn
Rhett, of Charleston, was yesterday
elected president of the Chamber
of Commerce of; the United States
at its annual meeting in Washington.
He succeeds .Mr. John H. Fahey, of
Boston.
.Mr. Rhett has been serving as
chairman of the executive committee
of the national chamber, a position
second in importance only to the
presidency of this organization, the
membership of which is" composed of
more than 700,000 business men in
every section of the country.
Since the organization of the national
chamber, which was greatly
encouraged by President Taft, Mr.
Rhett has been prominent in its affairs.
He was recognized from the
beginning as a leading Southern
member and his counsel has been
sought and headed.

Congressman Byrnes.
Washington. Feb. 10.?Congressman
Byrnes, of South Carolina, today
introduced a bill providing that
hereafter mileage of members of congress
be made "> cents per mile coming
to and returning home from
Washington once each session.
The present rate of such pay is 20
cents per mile and it has been said
that members coming from distant
States reap a good sum from this
source alone.
As .Mr. Byrnes is chairman of the
Ii/mico f.nmmittoo rm rnilPA2rP it is not
unlikely that his bill may pass,
though it is anticipated that it will
be vigorously opposed.
Washington, Feb. 11.?Congressman
Byrnes, of South Carolina, believes
he has found a plan that will
materially help shipping interests.
Today he introduced a bill providing
that the secretary of war and the
secretary of navy turn over to the
department of commerce such auxiliarv
vessels xis mav not be needed bv
r
them at the present time and that
the secretary of commerce be au
thorizcd to lease them to shipping interests
for coastwise trade.
.Mr. Byrnes believes that in this
way many obsolete ships now owned
by the navy department and possibly
vessels also owned by the war department
which are unfit for the purposes
for which originally built
might be put to good use by being
used for commercial purposes. Xot
only would many small craft be made
available but shippers would be able
to lease them at a reasonable appraisal.
So many horses have been commandeered
in Germany that oxen are being
used for plowing.
