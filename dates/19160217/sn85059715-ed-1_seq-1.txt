Gains Entrance' through Skylight
and Rifles the Cash
Register of $5.
A burglar, thought by the police to
be a mere child, smashed the skylight;
on the roof of Welch and Fullerton'd'
rimer nn Fourth atrppt WodnpK
day night, slid down a rope into the
store, rifled the cash register of $5
In cash and escaped through a renr
window.
Police are certain the burglar Is
only a child as the akylight is not
large enough to permit the entrance
of a man of any size. The burglar's
weakness for toying with the cash
register is another fact which leads
the police to the child theory. The
record In the register showed that the
bnrlar rang up the register eleven
times, although it is positive that,
only once was necessary for him to;
get the money.
The marauder apparently had no
taste for any of the store's stock of i
goods, as an Inventory Thursday i
morning revealed the fact that the
?5 in cash was the only thing missing.
Entrance was gained to the store1
by smashing the skylight and fastening
a rope to some place on the roof.
The maurader slid down this rope
into the store. He made hiB e>;lt
through a back window, which hei
easily unlocked from the Inside.
The robbery was not discovered until
clerks'at the store came down to
open up Thursday morning. The
rope dangling from the broken sky-i
light first attracted attention, and a
later investlgatlpn. showed that the
cash reviser had been rifled.
The robbery was reported to the
police, who are working on this case, i
it was said at police headquarters,
Thursday morning that they had no,
clue to the perpetrator of the crime,;
other than that he was a mere youth.

in Search of Bride, Who Deserted
Him, He Invades

Has anyone seen anything of a
stray wife strolling about the streets?
No, this Is no joke. A man. who
told the pollco his name was Clyde
Skinner, and who said be was n
plumber, carried his search for the
wife, who, he Bald, deserted liim last
spring, into the dressing rooms of
the Odeon theater Wednesday night,
and as a result he got into the tolls
of the law, but was later released
upon satlsfactoiy explanation of the
circumstances which led him there.
Skinner, it seems, though one of
the chorus girls of Znrrow's American
Girls Company, which Is showing this

he said, deserted htm in Alabama.
The young woman, whose name Is
Dorothy Shelton, claims that she never
saw Skinner before Wednesday
night and branded him ns a "masher."
Skinner, however, explained to
the po'ice that lie wns In good faith
in the scarrh for his wife and he
was released from custody.
According to the story given out
at police headquarters Thursday
Skinner was looking at the pictures
In front of the theater Sunday. In
one of the group pictures, he saw a
face, which, he said, he recognized as
that of his wife, who had deserted
him. He penned this not to the
young woman Wednesday morning:
"Please meet me at the postoflice
between five and six, say 5:30
prompt.
"Please don't fa'l. If you do. I
will spoil everything.
"Meet me and tell no one about it.
You can't fool me, kiddo. I saw
your picture Sunday and knew you
at once.
"CLYDE."
Immediately upon receipt of the
note. Miss Shelton took it to police
headquarters. She was told to go to
the postoflice at the hour stated in
the note. City Detective L. L. White
was detailed to be on hand to arrest
the man, who was believed to be a
"masher." Miss Shelton was there
at the appointed time, but Skinner
failed to show up. MIsb Shelton then
requested that she be given police
protection after the performance in
the evening and Detective White kept
an eye out around the rear dooir of
the theater. About 10:30 o'clock.
Skinner appeared on the scene. He

room, and demanded of one of the actors
that he see Miss Shelton. Detective
White and Miss Shelton, both
waiting in the dressing room about
the same time, the former placing
Skinner under arrest.
Skinner, it is said, took n good
look at Miss Shelton and explained
to the officer that he had been mistaken
in thinking that she was his
wife. He was then released and the
Incident closed, so far as the police
are concerned.

William Lorinier's rapid rise from ,
a Chicago newsboy to a scat in the:
United States Senate and his fail [
when his seat was declared vacant on ;
the ground that hlB election had been
procured by fraud and bribery, form :
an interesting chapter in the political
history of Illinois. Nearly a year after
Lorlmer's election to the Senate,
Charles A. White, a member of the
legislature, who had voted for Lorlmer,
made a written confession under
oath thnt he had received a bribe
for his vote and that a "Jack pot"
corruption fund had been used in the
session to influence legislation.
Lorimer was born In Manchester,
England, in 1861, the son of a Presbyterian
minister who emigrated
.with his family to this country and
I nettled In Chicago when yoflnd Lorl|
mer was nine years old. He sold
I newspapers on the streets of Chicago,
drove a inunury wagon ana Decanie u
street car driver before entered polltics.
He served twelve years in Congress
before he was elcted a United
Stater, senator, May 26, 1909.
Munday was a messenger boy and
then became a telegraph operator In
his home town of Litchfield, 111. Later
lie became Interested in the grain
business, and In 1910 came to Chicago
and Induced Lorlmer to enter a,
bank with him. May 10, 1910, the La
Salle Street National Bank opened
its doors with William Lorlmer, president,
and Charles B. Munday vice
president. The institution was denied
full admission to the Chicago
Clearing House and for a time operated
by clearing through another
bank.
October 22, 1912, the 'La Salle
Street National Bank was converted
Into the La Salle Street Trust and
Savings Bank, a state instltulon.
The Btate bank assumed all liabilities
and assets of the National, keep- ]

In the course of the next year, halt
a dozen smaller neighborhood banks
were orgstilzed In Chioigo by. l.orluier
and Munday and became known
as subsidiaries of the Id .Salle Street
Trust and Havings Bank. In addition
to these, Munday was Interested In
several down state banns which had
business dealing with the La Salle
Street "mint and Savings Bank.
June 12, 1914, Daniel V. Harkin, j
state bank examiner, appeared at the
I,a Salle Street Trust and Savings
Bank two hours before the regular
time for opening. Reports that the
parent Institution was Insolvent had
led to a serious run on the bank by
depositors. Ilarkln, after a brief examination
of the bank's affairs closets
the Institution. Within a few weeks;
all the subsidiary banks closed. Tho
Mundax. down state banks later felt!
the effect of the collapse or the La
Salle Street TruBt and Savings Bank,
ftecolvers alto were named for several
of the subsidiary banks. Moanwhile
the United States district attorney
and the state's attorney of.
Cook county had begun an lnveatl-i
gation of the bank's affairs. Numerous
business enterprises of William
Lorlmer and CharleB B. Munday followed
the bank into Inaolroncy.
Investigation showed that the
greater proportion of tho La Salle
Street Trust and Savings Bank assets
was made up of loans to enterprises
in which I.orimer, Munday and Harry
W. Huttlg were Interested.
As a result of these Investigations
Indictments were returned against
l.orlmer, Munday,* Hifttlg and others
by both federal and state grand
juries. Tlio federal Indictments were
rushed through In the summer of
1911 in order to get within the
statute of limitations, for these
charges were based on tho operation
of the bank prior to Its conversion
Into a state Institution, October 22,
1911.
The bulk of the state Indictments
were returned by the Cook county
grand jury'October 21, 1912. These
were against Lorlmer, Munday, Huttlg
and other officers and employes of
the bank nnd former officials of the
state auditor's office.
The fourtoen persons nanled in
toe indictments were auegoa to nave
looted the Lorimer-Munttty Institutions
of nearly $2,500,000, with violations
of practically every banking
law in the slate.
It was charged that assets of the
r.a Salle Street Trust and Savings
Bank had been used to organise the
subsidiary banks, that checks had
been "kited" In carrying out the plan
and that the parent bank had been
Insolvent for some time prior to the
eollapse.
State's Attorney Hoynes planned
to try all the defendants together,
rhe defndants opposed this and entered
motions for separate trials.
When these were overruled by the I
:ourts, Munday asked for a change j
af venue on the grounds of prejudice
ind the case was sent to Morris,
3rundy county, for trial.
The Lorliner-Huttlg case was expected
to go to trial oarly In Januiry,
