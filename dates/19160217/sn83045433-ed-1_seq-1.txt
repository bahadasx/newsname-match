BARNES VICTOR
OVER WHITMAN
IN HOT BATTLE
-
Three of Four Delegates to
Republican Convention
Known as His Men.
SENTIMENT FOR ROOT
Attempt to Launch National
Boom for Governor Check

GIVEN CRUMBS OF COMFORT
As Sort of "P. S." G. O. P. Men Go
on Record as indorsing His
Administration.
Snreial to Tba Waatdivftoe HersM.
New York. Feb. 'ti-Tho action of the
Republican State convention, which ended
Its session In Carnegie Hall today. Is
claimed by the followers of William
Barnes, jr.. as a victory for Mr. Barnes
over Gov. Whitman. The governor, they
say. had to be satisfied with a few small
crumbs that fell from the political table.
In support of this statement these facts
are cited.
Whitman was denied endorsement for
the Presidency or Vice Presidency: he
was not named chairman of the "bla
four" delegation to the national conven
tion in ?'hlcago; his administration re
ceived only a mild eleventh-hour "com
mendation. " This was not made a part
of the platform but was tacked on as
., *ort of "P. S."
Three Are Barnes Men.
With the exception of the governor
himself, all the members of the "big
f. u; ' are known as Barnes' men or antl
*A'h'tman men. Whitman himself was
named as governor of the State.
This is the delegation: James vT. Wads
worth, jr.. Gov. Charles Whitman. Fred
erick Tanner, and Elon R, Brown.
The delegation ?roes to the convention
unpledged and uninstructwd. Wadaworth,
Tanner and Brown are for anyone ex
ccpt Whitman for President. At heart
they are believed to be for Root.
The deadlock In the fight for delegates
was not broken until 3 o'clock this aft
ernoon. Then Barnes emerged as vlc
torL?'-?:! in the matter of alternates aa in
the matter .?f delegates and at the same
ratio?three to one.

the governor's superintendent of Insur
ance.
County Chairman Samuel P. Kocnlg
made a desperate effort to save Whitman
In the committee room. After the re
sult of the first ballot had been an
nounced. Koenig rushed over to Joseph
l.evlnson. who had voted for Wadaworth
snd Tanner and against David Jayn?
Hill.
"Change your vote. Joe." he demand
er!. "You've beaten Whitman."
"Clad of It." answered the leader of
the fourth district. "I'm for Jimmy
WaOsworth. and don't care who knows
it." Despite all pleading.? he. remained
obdurate and the Whitman forces were
Anally compelled to admit defeat.
??Wan? I Illiu Root."
Ti-.j sume lively scenes were being en
acted by tho committee on resolutions.
In the effort to jam through the Indorse
ment of Whitmans administration.
Speaker Sweet fought In vain to have the
resolution Included in the platform.
During the Interchange of repartee on I
tiie Indorsement of Whitman, former
Secretary of War Henry U. St lineo ?
shouted :
"If we ?re going to express our chote?
tor President we might Just as well an
nounce that the Kepublkans of this State

Special u> Th, Waahington Herald.
Minneapolis, Minn., Feb. 16.?
How Woodrow Wilson made
his exit from this city about
seventeen years ago standing
in the rear of a wagon hanging
onto his trunk to keep it from
falling off, is recalled by his
host on that occasion.
Samuel S. Thrope tells the
story to illustrate the democ
racy of the President. He was
at that time a professor at
Princeton.
Train time was near, and it
was decided to take the trunk
on the family wagon. Down the
main street went Prof. Wilson,
hanging onto the seat with one
hand, clinging to the trunk with
the other, and enjoying the fun
like a schoolboy.

Vigorous Artillery Duel Rages for Two

Ruined City.
Special Labi? to The Washington Herald.
London. Feb. 16? In a desperate deter

tured on Monday by the German? south
east of Tpres, in Belgium, the British to

sides and in failure to the British, ac
cording to th? Berlin official report.
The German war office assert? that the
efforts of the French to regain ground
lout northwest of Tabure, In the Cham
pagne, were equally unsuccessful. The
French afternoon communique assert?.
however, that "cartata trench sections"
ware recover?? in the Tahure section,
but the midnight report is silent aa to
spy further gain.
A vigorous artillery duel baa beam in
progress for two days over the greater
part of the Ypres, with the German guns
steadily shelling the ruined city.
Now British troops, who have just
completed their training In France, are
lap;ng used against the seasoned Ger
man veterans on the Flanders front.

The headquarters report reads: "Ar
till'-ry bombardments on both side? and
heavy fighting with hand grenades have
occurred in the last twenty-four hours
between the Ypres-Comlnes Canal and
the Tpres-Comlne? Railway. The flght
?rg continues.
"The capture of eoo yards of our line
trench, reported yesterday, was preceded
by a heavy bombardment and the explo
sion of five mines, which rendered our
front trenches untenable. The attacks
entended over 4.000 yards of the front
and were repulsed everywhere else with
considerable loes to the enemy.
"The trench captured by the enemy
has frequently changed hands during the
last year, and for this reason is called
'the International trench.' "

I_ondon, Feb. It?Charges that British
airmen at the front arc outclassed by
their German opponents were made li
the House of Commons today.
The government waa severely cri t? sed
for Its failure to protect London and
other cities from attack by German air
ships.
In the course of the debate, announce
ment was made that hereafter the air
defense of England would be in the
hands of the army. Sir Percy Scott, who
had had charge of the defences under
the admiralty, has been transferred to
the war office.
"The gunnery of the coast defenses is
wholly Inadequate," said William Joyn
son-Hlcks, moving an amendment to the
address in reply to the king's speech.
"The anti-aircraft corpi? on the e-aat
coast at one time were only armed with
ten maxim puns which had been used
In the Boer war. T_ater a few 9 pound
pom-poms were added which had been
thrown out of Ixmdon as useless."
Mr. Joynson-Hlcks urged that British
aeroplanes raid the Zeppelin sheds and
the Krupp works at Essen, but he doubt.
eed whether "England has the necessary
powered machines to carry out such an
attack. "*
"Our airmen are outclassed." he cried.
"The country demands that something
be done.
