o'clock and caught fire, reaulting In
a known loco of nine Uvea. It la poe
alble that othero periahed, but ao far
aa known at preta time today the nine
liattd aa dead account for all thoao
missing.

aearch of the ruina wa continued In

An official Investigation will follow,
It la aaid. It la beloved the exploaon
caused tho demollahment of tho struc
ture, wheh wa followed by a fire.
Five buildings were the total damage.
What I considered aa tho most
probable atory of the cause of tho ex
plosion la that G. W. Parkin entered
the building early In the evening and
lit a gaa atovo In a vacant room. It
la thought possible there may have
been a leak from tho communicating
pipe, and the atovo fire Ignited the
fume. The upper etoriea of the old
opera houae came down with a thud,
and ahrleko for help came from the
ruina. Every resident of Mexia camo
to the ruina and few pcrtono retired
