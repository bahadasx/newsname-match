Erzerum, Turkey's chief city in Ar-

Heavy -' assaults by the Russians
against the Ions line of detached forts
protecting the city, lasting over a per

Grand Duke Nicholas, the Russian
commander-in-chief, as "unprecedent

was besieged in the city with pro
visions for only a fortnight.
Of Great Strategic Importance.
The capture of Erzerum is consid
ered of great strategic importance.
From it radiate roads leading in all
directions. Over those to the south

the Russians now to fight their way

The Immediate effect of the Russian ;
I'ictory- on the situation in Persia and
Mesopotamia is problematical, how
sver, for despite the roads the coun
try is mountainous and there is still
much ground to be covered some
thing over 200 miles before the Lake
Urumiah district of Persia is reached
nd over 600 miles before a junction
with the British at Kut-el-Amara
could be formed.
With the advent of stormy weather
an the western battle line, the heavy
fighting of the past few days seem
ingly has simmered down again to
artillery bombardments and mining
operations. Berlin reports, however,
that the British and French have en

LYMAN CLEANED UP
8500,000 AS A BROKER
Louis B.' Thornet Says He' Promised
to Teach Him the Methods.
New .York, Feb. 16. Additional details-
regarding the operations of J.
Grant Lyman, sought by the federal
authorities for stock swindling by use
of the mails, were disclosed today at
a hearing in the involuntary bank
ruptcy proceedings against John H.
Putnam & Co.,, the firm name under
which Lyman conducted a brokerage
business in this city.
Louis B. Thornet, charged with be
ing a co-conspirator with Lyman, tes
tified that his employer had informed
him he had "cleaned up" $540,000 as
a broker and promised to teach him
"the methods of the street." Thornet,
who has confessed he aided Lyman in
escaping from a Los Angeles hospi
tal where he was a prisoner, asserted
he unexpectedly met Lyman in
Springfield, Mass., last November. The
witness said he was working at that
time in a machine shop and gladly ac
cepted an offer of a salary double
what he was then earning.
Another witness, an employe of a
brokerage house, stated he had heard
reports that Lyman had a contract
for supplying the United States army
with woolen socks and that he intend
ed to engage in the munitions" busi
ness on a large scale.
Miss Alice Lyman, sister of Lyman,
admitted that on previous occasions
she had received mail for her brother
but declared she had no knowledge
Df his operations here. Among the
other witnesses were two chauffeurs
employed by Lyman at different timse.
WORKMEN AVERAGING $14
A DAY GO ON STRIKE.
Drop Forgers, Die 'Sinkers and Trim
mars of Bridgeport Remington Plant.
Bridgeport, Conn., Feb. 16. One
hundred 'drop forgers, die sinkers and
trimmers employed at the Remington
Arms and Ammunition company want
out on .'strike this afternoon an dit is
expected that fifty more men will ! jave
tlxtir bences- tomorrow morning. A
disagreement over the payment for
spoiled work is the cause of the walk
out on strike this afternoon and It is
' that .work spoiled by the men must
be paid for by . the operatives. -The
men - claim that it is unfair to force
then) to pay for material . which then
reverts to the ownership of the com
pany. ,
Another contention of the men is
that! those who work on a piece work
basis are frequently forced to labor
without being paid for it. The com
pany counters with the statement that
these men earn on an average of $14
a day, and that they should be will
ing to do -a little extra work when
tools for their particular calling axe
lacking.
Union officials predicted tonight that
unless some settlement Is reached to
morrow every man in the vast fac
tories will be called out. The com
pany spokesman expected the men to
return to work In the morning. -

AMERICAN MADE MUNITIONS
POURING INTO EUROPE
At the Rate of Nearly Two Million
Dollars' WortK Daily.
Washington, Feb. 16. American
made war munitions are now pouring
into Europe at the rate of nearly two
million dollars worth daily, with the
figures swelling rapidly as production
increases. For a long time after the
war began shipments were negligible
and not until the middle of 1915 did
the millions of dollars worth of war
materials contracted for begin to
move in considerable quantities.
Estimates made at the department
of commerce today put total muni
tions shipments since Europe began
o purchase for the present war close
to a quarter of a billion dollars. At
the rate shipments are going now, the
next four months would see this total
doubled even if production remained
at a standstill, but prediction is de
clared to be growing faster now than
at any time since American manufac
turers began conversion of their
.ilants into munitions factories.
A great part of the munitions out
put has been in the form of high ex
plosive shells, more than one hundred
million dollars worth of which have
left American shores. Powder comes
next with shipments estimated at
nearly one hundred millions and small
arm cartridges are third with $30,000,
000. Firearms, including ordnance
exports, are put less than $20,000,000
with small increases shown. The
heaviest month's firearms shipments
was in January, 1915, when more than
$2,000,000 worth went to Europe.

PRINCIPLES OF NEW
SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN
Is Delaying Settlement of the Lusi
tania Controversy.
Washington, Feb. 16. The subma
rine controversy with Germany can
not be closed until the United States
has fully considered the possible effect
of the declared intention of the Ger
manic powers to sink all armed mer
chant ships of their enemies without
warning after Feb. 29.
This announcement was made by
Secretary Lansing today instead of
the long expected announcement of a
final settlement of the Lusitania nego
tiations. Perfected by months of patient and
at times perilous negotiations, the
Lusitania agreement was presented
today by Count Von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, in a form which
would have been acceptable to the
United States had not the Germanic
powers announced their determina
tion to regard armed merchant ships
of their enemies as warships.
The Lusitania agreement now will
not be accepted as finally satisfactory
to the United States until President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing , have
decided whether any of its terms
would be nullified by the principles of
the new submarine campaign.

DEBATE ON AIR DEFENSE
OF GREAT BRITAIN
Called Forth Many Frank Admissions
in Parliament.
London, Feb. 16, 9.55 p. m. Today's
debate in parliament on the air defense
of Great Britain was chiefly remarka
ble for the frank admission made by
the cabinet's spokesmen that the pres
ent conditions are far from satisfac
tory. Andrew Bonar Law, secretary
for the colonies; A. J. Balfour, first
lord of the admiralty-; and H. J. Ten
nant, under-secretary for war, all
spoke in this vein. They declared,
however, that the government was do
ing all that was humanly possible.
Mr. Balfour scored the sensation of
the day when he declared that one of
England's great mistakes in the days
prior to the war was her failure to
develop a dirigible airship fleet along
lines .similar to that of Germany.
Comedian Drops Dead.
Troy, N. Y., Feb. 16. Frank L. Bar
ry, a well known comedian, ' who has

MANY WERE INJURED
Gas Explosion Which Followed the
Collapse, . Caused a Fire Which
Threatened the Business Section of
the Town. "
Mexia, Texas, Feb. 16. Ten persons
were killed here early tonight in the
collapse of the opera house, building,
which was followed by a gas explosion
and fire that for a time threatened
the business section of the town. Nu
merous persons were injured.
. Searching for Buried Bodies.
Search continued late into the night
for- the . other bodies which it was
feared might buried in the ruins, al
though it was believed that all the
persons in the building had been ac
counted for. The dead included Prof.
A. B. Wiesner, superintendent of city
schools, Mrs. Weisner and one of their
children, and Prof. O. B. Bruton of
Winnsboro, Tex.
Spectators Had Begun to Assemble.
Only the fact that the accident oc
curred at an early hour is believed to
have prevented a larger loss of life.
Tihe opera house, which was old and
seldom used, had been opened for an
art exhibition for the public schools
which gave promise of being largely
attended. The spectators had begun
to assemble when the structure gave
way, burying them in debris and heavy
timbers.
Gas Explosion Caused Fire.
A gas explosion followed almost im
mediately. This caused fire in the
wreckage. The flames spread to other
buildings, including the Farmers States
bank, and so rapid was the progress of
the fire that it seemed certain to con
sume the town. After four hours, the
fire was got under control.

NEW LONDON TO N. Y.
F. V. Chapped of New London Told
I. C. C. That Deprivation of Control
of the Steamships Would be a "Bus
iness Crime."
New York, Feb. 16. Evidence in
support of the application of the Cen
tral Vermont railway for permission
to continue the operation of a line of
steamships between New York and
New London, Conn., under the Panama
canal act, was presented here today to
Interstate Commerce Commissioner
Judson C. Clements by business men
and shippers living in New York and
New England.
Would Cause Broken Shipments.
F. V. Chappell, chairman of the riv
ers, harbors and bridges commission
of Connecticut, declared if the railway
company was deprived of control of
the steamships of the Vermont Trans
portation company it would be a
business crime. He joined with
other witnesses in contending that the
divorcing of the two corporations
would be unfortunate because the un
broken shipments could be made from
the Central Vermont's territory.
Service of C. V. Uniformly Good.
Testimony was given to show that
the service given by the Vermont Cen
tral had been uniformly good and that
so far as the witnesses knew no ef
fort had been made by the railroad to
stifle competition. It was maintained
that if steamships were operated in
dependently freight rates would be
higher.
The hearing will be continued to
morrow. COMMITTEE HEARING

Xew York, Feb. 16. The republican
national campaign will be fought on
demands for adequate military pre
paredness and tariff reform, opposi
tion to granting early independence to
the Philippines and insistence on a
vigorous stand for American rights
both in Mexico and in relation to the
European war, according to the "Key
note" platform adopted today by tfae
republican state convention.
- Fight Against Whitman.
The outlines of the platform, which
was approved unanimously, were pre
sented last night in a speech of former
Senator Elihu Root. No difference of
opinion was apparent among the 832
delegates to the convention in regard
to the platform, but a bitter fight was
precipitated by the attempt of the sup
porters of Governor Whitman to se
cure an unqualified endorsement for
his administration and to force his
nomination as chairman of the delega
tion to the national convention in Chi

The net result was that New York

ApriL .
A determined fight, led by Henry
L Scimson, to obtain a resolution rec
ommending Mr. Root as -New York's
favorite son for the presidency - was
defeated in the committee on resolu
tions, and a counter resolution that no
presidential candidate be endorsed was
passed unanimously.
Opposition to Endorsement of Root.
The principal ground upon which the
opponents of Kie 1 Root discussion
fought was that an endorsement of
Mr. Root would preclude the possi
bility of New York putting forward
Supreme Court Justice Charles E.'
Hughes as the state candidate for the
presidency. Nicohlas Murray, chair
man of the committee, issued a formal
statement in which he said that Mr.
Root was himself opposed to the use
of his name.

NO EVIDENCE OF
INCENDIARISM FOUND
In Fire on Brooklyn Waterfront Which
Destroyed Three British Ships.
New York, Feb. 16. No evidence of
incendiarism has been found by Chief
Fire Marshal Brophy, it was an
nounced tonight, in connection with
the fire on the Brooklyn waterfront
early today which caiaArd the destruc
tion of three British steamships, 37
ligiters and barges, a new 900 foot
pier belonging to the New York Dock
company and $1,000,000 worth of mer
chandise consigned to the entente al
lies. The total loss is estimated at be
tween (3,000,000 and $4,000,000.
Although nearly 300 persons were
imperilled by the flames, which raged
fiercely for several hours, only one was
unaccounted for tonight. The missing
man was a member of the crew of one
of the steamers. Several persons were
injured, however, and there were many
sensational rescues.
There were reports throughout the
day that the fire was started by an
Incendiary, but they probably were
based upon the fact that the immense
quantity of merchandise on board the
vessels and on the pier was destined
for European governments now en
gaged in war. A rigid investigation
conducted by officials of the fire de
partment has convinced them that de
fective electric wiring was responsible
for the flames.
DANIELS MODIFIES
WIRELESS CENSORSHIP
Announcement Made Soon After Ger
man Ambassador Had Asked for Ex
planation. Washington, Feb. IS. Secretary
Dafllels announced today that he
would authorize a modification of the
regulations under which wireless des
patches are censored by naval officers
so aa to permit, when no violation of
neutrality was involved, the passage
of messages referring to naval vessels
and operation of belligerent ships.
This announcement was made soon
after Count Von Bernstorff. the Ger
man ambassador, had asked the state
department for an explanation of why
the American naval censors at Say
ville. N. Y., had rejected wireless des
patches -from Berlin, containing offi
cial announcements from the admiral
ty which the British censors had
passed for publication in England.
Mr. Daniels explained that censors
had acted under the - existing regula
tions, drafted by a' board of naval
officers after an exhaustive study of
ine question or; censorship and pro
hibiting the transmission into this
country of any message referring to
"movement or location of war or
other vessels of belligerents.''
fought out between the "old line" or-i
ganization republicans under leader-'
shi pof William Barnes and the sup
porters of Governor Whitman. The
Barnes men entered the convention,
with the avowed purpose of refusing
an endorsement of the Whitman ad
ministration and preventing the gov-'
ernor from heading the Xew York dele
gation to the national convention.
Compromise Resolutions.
The question of endorsement ended
in a compromise by which two reso
lutions were presented to tile conven
tion, one dealing exclusively with na
tional affairs and the other "commend
ing" Governor Whitman for his con
duct of the state administration.
National Delegates.
This partial victory of the governoi
was offset by a complete defeat on
the question of the national delegates.
The Whitman forces had united all
their strength in an effort to nominate'
David Jayne Hill of Rochester as one
of "Big Four," the Barnes faction de
clared themselves absolutely opposed
to Dr. Hill and presented instead the
name of William Berri of Brooklyn.
After- a- ngtrf'wBlcB lasted for four
hours, the committee on delegates
finally agreed on State Senator James
Wadaworth, Jr.. Charles Whitman,
Frederick C. Tanner and Elon R.
Brown, republican leader in the stats
senate. As Wadsworth, Tanner and
Brown are all reputed anti-Whitman'
men, the committee's decision was ac
cepted as a decisive defeat for Gover
nor Whitman. .
No Recommendation for Chairman.
The committee further announced
that no recommendation would be
made as to chairman of the "Big Four"'
in spite of Governor Whitman's pub-,
liehed declaration that he expected to
be named afts head of the national dele
gation. To add point to the announce
ment. Senator Wadsworth's nam
headed the list given out by the com
mittee and was the first put in nomi
nation at the convention. According;
to custom, the first delegate named
acts as chairman, although the matter
of leader is left for final decision to
the delegates themselves.

missal of the petition, alleging the .
