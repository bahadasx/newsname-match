PARENTS PROTEST
QUESTIONS; GILL
ALSO IS 'STUMPED'
You have heard a lot al>out "the city with the best public
schools in the United States"—Seattle.
But wouldn't it give you a jolt to learn that, according
to an official mind UM used in the public schools on 12-year
old children, mo«t of the officials who govern this remarkable
municipality arc "feeble-minded"?
Not to say that some of them have proved themselves
practically "imbeciles"?
According to the much-discussed Binet test, the ranks
of the mentally unsound have been augmented by the follow
ing distinguished company:
Mayor Gill.
Councilman Hesketh.
Councilman Fitzgerald.
County Clerk Sickels. f
Sheriff Hodge.
Secretary Jones, of the school board.
AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OP
EDUCATION!
The Binet test, the invention of two French psychologists,
has been under criticism in other cities for some time. Under
its provisions hundreds of public school pupils here have been,
declared to be mentally below par.
Parental Curiosity Leads to an Inquiry
Parents of some of these children finally began to asWV
themselves, "What is this test under which our little ones
have been branded as feeble minded?"
This started The Star in its inquiry.
The Star learned that when a pupil'a work begins to fall
below classroom par, he is put thru a mental efficiency test. ,
If he fails to pass, he is placed in a class aegregated frotnT
the rest of the students. He is then known as a "deficient!?
A totally deficient child is sent to a school for feeble
minded at Medical Lake.
Here arc two sentences which children, under the Binet
test, are expected to re(>eat after hearing them once:
"I saw in the street a pretty little dog. He had
curly brown hair, short legs and a long tail."
A normal child of 12 is supposed to be able to repeat the
sentences exactly.
Not one of a score of grownup Seattleites. officials and
private citizens, could do it. *
When Mayor (lill was asked to repeat the sentence, he
declared he would not attempt to.
"I'll bet any man in Seattle $100 that I can start in at
the top floor of the Alaska building and ask every man on
every floor the same thing, and there won't be 10 per cent
of them that'll do it correctly. I don't believe 1 per cent
could."
Councilmen "Fall Down" on Te*t
Councilman Hesketh gave the answer this way, after the
sentences had been repeated thrice to him:
"I saw in the street a pretty little dog. He had brown
curly hair, short legs and a long tail."
He had the words "brown" and "curly" transposed.
Here's the way Councilman Fitzgerald got it:
"I saw in the street a pretty little dog. He had curly
hair, short legs and long hair."
Sheriff Hodge, after the first reading, repeated, "I saw
on the street a pretty little dog. He had brown curly hair and
a cunning little tail."
When told that the dog had a "long" tail, the sheriff
leaped out of his chair and declared the two sentences were
misleading.
"Whoever heard of a little dog with a long tail?" he
shouted. "1 got the sense of the thing as it should be. A
