A STATE CONVENTION
Held in Palatka by the Florida
Republicans
NOMINATE AND RESOLUTE
Give the Democratic Party "Par
ticular Fits" To Contest
for Chief State Offices
The Herald has many subscrib
ers who are Republicans , and
they pay their debts and other
wise behave as excellent citizens.
It is, therefore, due them that
The, Herald should eive. snace to
the proceedings of their state and,movirf the causes for them and
district conventions which met in
Palatka on Wednesday of last
week. 'The resolutions adopted
by them are also given below, and
The Herald cordially disapproves
of them.
The nominations made are as
follows : ;
For governor, George W. Allen
of Key West.
For United States senator, W.
R. O'Neal of Orlando.
Congress, First district, Henry
W. Bishop of Eustis.
Congress.Second district, Judge
William Gober of Ocala.
Congress, Third district, F. E.
Miller, Pensacola.
Congress, Fourth district, D. T.
Gerow of Jacksonville.
Delegates were elected to . the
Republican National convention,
which will meet in Chicago June
7, as follows: at large Henry S.
Chubb, Princton; Z. T. Bielby,
DeLand; Joseph E. Lee, Jacksonville-,
M. B. Macfarlane, Tampa;
First district G. W. Bean, Tam
pa ; Second district L. C. Lynch,
Gainesville; Third district W.
H.. Northrup, Pensacola ; Fourth
district W. R. O'Neal, Orlando.
The delegates go uninstructed.
Most, if not all of the nominees
arc men of high character.
The resolutions adopted give
the Democratic party "particular
fits," as witness:
"Be it resolved, by the Repub
licans of the state of Florida', in
state convention assembled, that
we condemn the present vacillat
ing, free trade, treasury deplet
ing, deficit making, note writing,
extravagant Mexican fiasco demo
cratic administration. The dem
ocratic party solemnly promised
protection to all American citi
zens at home and abroad, and in
fulfillment of their promise our
countrymen are murdered and
robbed in Mexico, and are bom
barded and drowned on the high
seas. The democratic party
promised and campaigned on the
issue, that if elected, they would
pass such tariff and other laws as
would cause a great reduction in
the price of living. Yet the mar
ket reports of the necessities and
comforts of life show that after
the passage of the Underwood
tariff law therefore eight months
prior to the European war, there
was no reduction whatever, there
by confessing their utter inability
to keep this pledge.
"The democratic party vocif
erously charged the republican
party with extravagance in ap
propriating the public funds of
the treasury and promised strict
economy in all public expendi
tures. Yet the last democratic
congress, with the concurrence of
a democratic president, expended
one hundred and seventy-seven
million dollars more than the last
republican congress. The demo
emtio, party promised a stern
prosecution of so-called
trusts,
and their record on such prosecu
tions is absolute failure, and the
attornev-sreneral of the United
States a short time ago issued a
statement, which amounted to a
nmn kmatinn that, the SO-CalleQ
trusts had nothing to fear from
tho administration. The demo -
nmtir. nnrtv promised, under the
operation of a democratic tariff
law a wider opportunity and
greater blessings for both capital
and labor. Yet it is a fact be
yond contradiction, that the eight
months' operation of the Under
wood tariff law, and before the
European conflict there commenc
ed a terrible commercial stagna
tion, financial operations were
brought to a standstill and labor
was thrown out of employment in
the great manufacturing centers
of the country, and but for the
TO CONSERVE HEALTH
The State Board is Educating the
People
HAS ESTABLISHED SYSTEM
That Works Successfully and
Now Doubles Number of Dis
trict Health Nurses
Knowledge of the conditions
that conserve health is the surest
prevention of disease.
Prevention is the modern way
to treat disease a system of pre-
paredness that wins battles by re
settlesavars that never happen
Florida's State Board of Health
something more than a year ago
established a system of educating
the people of the. State particular
ly with regard to the prevention
of tuberculosis and the treatment
of the disease in its earlier and
curable stages. Under this plan
three trained, and efficient nur
were sent out into the State, each
with her own district or section
to cover; within that district to
become acquainted with actual
conditions; to investigate, so fat
as possible all individual cases
where the disease had obtained a
hold; to advise as to the care of
the patient; to urge and put in
operation the open air isolation
of each case and to adivso and to
warn against transference of the
disease to others who might bo
come infected.
Manifestly it was impossible
for the three nurses to maintain
efficient service among the 600,
000 or 700,000 people outside the
larger cities, and in July of 1915,
the three nurses were increased
to six, each with approximately
100,000 citizens and citizenesses
under, her care.
Very soon it was discovered
that .these women who were
bringing help to the helpless were
called upon for advice about
many health and sanitary condi
tions besides tuberculosis. Moth
erf of sick children, men and wo
men and children with sub-normal
health or suffering from ma
ladies of which they knew noth-
great foreign war, . which has
caused an immense demand for
army supplies and munitions of
war, the United States would be
in the throes of a terrible finan
cial depression.'
"The democratic party promis
ed a free canal for our coastwise
shipping, and immediately violat
ed this promise when coming into
power. The democratic party in
their platform and morals de
manded a one-term tenure for
presidential service, yet they are
now preparing to re-nominate
President Wilson for a second
term. Such vacillation in public
pledges and principles is unparal
leled in American political his
tory. "Be it further resolved that
the administration invasion of
Mexico at Vera Cruz, for the a
vowed purpose of demanding
from President Huerta of Mexico
that he salute our flag for an in
sult to the same, and then calling
our fleet home without such salute
has lessened our dignity among
the powers of the world, and
made our foreign policy the jest
of every civilized power. Be it
further resolved that we hail with
pleasure the signs of coming vic
tory for the republican policies of
American protective : tariff, and
for. preparedness that will pre
serve American rights on both
land and sea in our own republic
and on foreign shores.
'Be it further resolved, that we
look with confidence to the repub
lican national convention to be
'held in Chicago, June 7, to adopt
1 a platform and nominate a presi-
dential ticket that will inspire
and unify all patriotic citizens
I who believe in protection, pros-
perity and preparedness, and who
will secure for all Americans at
home and abroad protection for
both life and property.

tary and state central committee.

inc. asked for help and advice
and it was given as free as air.
So successful has been the
practical working out of this
method of education, that the
State Board of Health at its meet
ing at Pensacola, February 8th,
determined once more to double
the number of district public
health nurses, and as soon as the
plan can be worked out to meet
the new conditions, and the State
be re-districted, twelve of them
will be at work in Florida, com
ing with their messages of advice
and encouragement and personal
aid to those who need them most.
Thev will not confine their
work to the tuberculous, but they
will be advisers about sanitation
and how to get and maintain bet
ter health conditions. ,As scouts
on the firing line, they will bring
first aid to those in, trouble and
will summon skilled medical serv
ice when it is needed.
Of course, most of them will
have from 50,000 to 60,000 people
in her district, but many of these
will not need the service. The ex
tension of this service is an ex
tension of the efficiency of the
Board in a most practical way.
In order to secure utmost effi
ciency in the added service, the
six new nurses will be appointed
by competitive examination be
fore a board of expert medical
men and sanitists. It will be held
at the offices of the State Board
of Health, Jacksonville, February
25 th and 26th

service calls for added expend!
turC. And how has it been pro
vided f
By robbing the hog!
The free distribution of hog
cholera serum to the farmers of
Florida some years ago was put
upon the State Board of Health
by a legislature that must have
had greater consideration for the
swine ot their constituents man
for the constituents themselves.
Now hoe cholera serum is a very
expensive medicine, but' the dis
ease itself is not communicaDie to
humans and is not properly a tax
upon the funds of the Board,
which are raised for the conserva
tion of human health.
Conseauently the Board of
Health, up at Pensacola cut the
Gordian knot with one swift
slash. They decided to limit the
free distribution of this hog medi
cine during 1916 to $10,000 not
a cent more and it cost more
than $20,000 in 1915.
The difference this year will
support the six new nurses in
their work for Florida, and not a
cent of additional burden will be
nut unon the tax-payers.
It's a distinct recognition of
the increasing rights of human
beings to have health and health
