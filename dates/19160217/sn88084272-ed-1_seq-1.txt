PETROGRAD, RUSSIA, Feb 17 The
Official Messenger estimates the
Turkish garrison at Erzerum, cap
ture of which was announced Wednes
day at 100,000. It Is also estimated that
more than 1000 guns were captured.
From such information as Is avail
able It would appear that the Turkish
army succeeded in slipping out of Kr
7erum, thus evading surrender. The
Turks are supposed to have escaped
Into a difficult mountain country to tho
westward, with scanty provisions and
fnclng the necessity of nasty flight
from the Russian pursuing forces.
Trehlmnil Capture May Follow,
The capture of Erzerum is regarded
in the allied capitals as most import
ant, accbrding to congratulatory dis
patches which have been sent to the
emperor and the ministry of war.
This victory Is expected to facilitate
the capture of Treblzond on the Black
sea coast and the relief or the British
army hemmed In by Turks at Kut-El-Amara,
Mesopotamia.
Grand Duke's MenKase.
In the official Tunnouncement of the
capture of Erzerum, the ministry of
war made public the fallowing message
from grand duke Nicholas, commander
In chief in tho Caucasus, to the em
peror: "God has granted the brave troops
of the army of Caucasus such great
help that Erzerum has been taken after
five days of unprecedented assault. I
am inexpressibly happy to announce
this victory to your imperial majesty."

The War At a Glance
WITH the capture of Erze
rum by the Russians, In
terest In war operations
has shifted Its center momentarily
to the fields of warfare in Armenia,
Persia and Mesopotamia. Dispatch
es from Petrograd say the official
Messenger estimates the ' Turkish
garrison at Erzerum at 100,000 men
and the number of guns captured at
more than 1000.
Turks Silent Regarding: Erzernm
The current Turkish official
statement gave no record of the
capture of the fortress. The only
mention of the operations In this
war area Is the declaration that the
Russians In the fighting of the
three days preceding lost 5000 dead
and 60 prisoners.
Erzerum Garrison Flees
Unofficial advices from Petro
grad say the Turkish army Is flee
ing westward from Erzerum
through a difficult mountain re
gion. Military observers In allied cap
itals expect the Russian success to
facilitate the capture of Treblzond
on the Black sea coast and the re
lief of the British army in Meso
potamia. Other Fighting Slackens
Fighting on the western front has
lessened In Intensity, probably be
cause of the prevailing bad weather
and similar conditions prevail In
Russia.

Italians in the eighth attack by
their outposts on the Austrian po

PANAMA, reb 17. One-fourth to

South American countries are il

Sreer. secretary of the American Pres
byterian board, who Is presiding over
the Congress of Religious Wcrii in,
Latin-America in session here.
Dr. Speer's statement Is included In
the report of the commission on wom
en s work which was presented to the
congress today.
Terrible Pictures of Women's Lot.
Terrible pictures of the lot of the
women of the poorer classes In Latin
America are drawn In the report Re
ferring more particularly to the west
coast of the southern half of the conti
nent the commission says: "The birth
rate Is largo but the death Tate among
Infants Is also great From 40 to 90
percent die under two years of age.
c cauBea are an unguaraea muK sup

babies who died in Chile alone in 1909.
less than one ear old, because of al
coholism and anti-hygienic conditions."
Enormous Infant Death Rate.
As a further illustration of the enor
mous Infant death rate in the southern
republics the commission draws a com
parison with the rate In the registra
tion area of the United States where. In
1911, IS percent of the total deaths
were those of Infants. As against this
41 percent of the total deaths in Chilo
In the same ear were of infants; in
Valparaiso the official figures were S33
per 1000, In Concepclon, 46 percent Val
dlvla, 43 percent
In striking contrast to the conditions
prevailing among the poorer classes of
the populations the commission finds
that the Latin -American women of the
wealthier ranks of society live on as
high a plane as any of their sisters In
the north or In Europe Georges Clem
enceau, former premier of France, is
quoted as saying regarding the higher
class of women In Argentina"
Fnmlly Tie Strong In Argentlnn.
"The family tie appears to be strong
er In the Argentine than, perhaps, in
any other land The rich take pleasure
in having large families. The greatest
affection prevails and the greatest de
votion to the family rooftree. Tho
women enjoy a reputation, which seems
well justified, of being extremely vir
tuous. In their role of faithful guard
ians of the hearth they have been able
to silence calumny and Inspire univer
sal respect by the purity and dignity of
their lives."
.No Middle Clans.
Similar tributes are paid to the wom
en of the richer classes in the other
southern republics. The commission
points out, however, that there Is prac
tically no middle class In South Ameri
ca and that a girl who has to work for
her living Is treated w ith much disdain,
even women teachers having little so
cial standing.
One result of the commission's Inves
tigation Is the conclusion that a great
change is coming in Latin-America In
regard to the status of the women. The
"women movement" Is said to be mak
ing steady progress, women are gradu
ally taking a more active part In poli
tics and business and the efforts of the
missionary organizations to relieve the
lot of the poorer classes are declared
to have met with most gratifying re
sults, although seriously hampered by
lack of workers and funds
Send Only Good Looking Women.
American missionary societies think
ing of sending women workers to Latin-America
should take care not to send
"frumps, dowdies or otherwise unpre
sentable persons" according to Senonta
Ellsa Cortes, an attractive Young Wom
en's Christian association representa
tive from Buenos Aires, who spoke at
the congress on religious work.
Senorlta Cortes asserted that a good
appearance was as essential as a good
education. She also cautioned those
undertaking such work to come pre
pared with good social equipment, be
cause excellent results could bo at
tained through social activities. She
urged that such workers would require
sufficient salaries to permit of the pur
chase of suitable garments, which are
exceedingly expensive In South Amer
ica. Government Lenders Oppose Church.
Many governmental leaders In Latin
America frown on the work of the
churches, according to a report sub
mitted today by the commission on
cooperation and promltlon of unity.
At the same time the commission
reported that the great majority of the
public men of the southern republics
were fully alive to the urgent import
ance of raising the moral character and
ideals of their fellow citizens and were
willing to lend their aid to any move
ment which they believed would tend
to that result

1891 and 1993, with the result that it
was absorbed bv the New Haven road.

"As a lawver. Mr. Brandeis Is able

Lansing Tells How Many
Have Been Killed on Each
Side Of Boundary.
WASHINGTON, D. C Feb. IT
All of the state departments
data on the Mexican situation,
asked for by senator A. B. Fall, of
New Mexico, was transmitted to the
senate today by president Wilson and
under motion of chairman Stone of
the foreign relations committee, was
ordered printed as a public document
It had been expected some of it would
i be held confidential.
In a letter from secretary Lansing,
accompanying the report, it is said
that 76 American citizens were killed
in Mexico in the years 1313, 1914 and
1915, as against 47 in three years pre
ceding and that 26 civilian Ameri
cans and 16 soldiers were killed on
American soil In the same three years
aa a result or Mexican troubles.
Congrens; Wanted; Facta,
It has been charged in the senate
that congress had not been taken into
the confidence of the president as to
the facts which shaped his opinion
Into deciding to recognize the Qar
ranza faction as constituting the de
facto government of Mexico The
claim was also made in the heat of
indignation following the Santa Tsa
bel massacre, that Important facts
relative to conditions In Mexico had
been withheld from congress and the
public generally.
Not a Constltntional Government.
In describing the Carranza govern
ment secretary Lansing, wrote in the
report:
"It cannot be said that the de facto
government of Mexico is a constitu
tional government The de facto
government like the majority of rev
olutionary governments is of a mill
tary character, but that government
has committed itself to the holding
of elections and it Is confidently ex
pected that the present government
will, within a reasonable time, be
merged into or succeeded by a govern
ment organized under the constitution
and laws of Mexico."
Snysi Carrandataa Shovreil Loyalty.
Referring to the effort of the recent
Pan-American conference to get Mex
ican factions together, secretary Lan
sing wrote:
"Tho attempt to bring- the factions
together for a conference failed. On
the one hand, there seemed to be no
central organization among the Vlllista
forces; while, on the other hand, sub
mission to the central authority was
evidenced in the replies of the Car
rancistas. The unit and loyalty of tbe
Carranclstas appeared to indicate tn a
ultimate triumph of that faction."
