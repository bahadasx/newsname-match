Germans in the West Begin
Assault on Britons and
Win Long Trench
London, Feb. 16. Reuter's
Petrograd correspondent tele
graphs that Erzerum has been
captured by the Russians.
The capture of Erzerum has
been the objective of the recent
campaign of the Russians In the
Caucasus. Its position Is' of con
siderable strategic Importance, as
It Is the chief city of Turkish Ar
menla and the center of a system
of roads. It has been understood
that the Turks had concentrated
at Erzerum an army of consider
able size.
Erzerum Is about sixty miles
west of the Russian border. It has
belonged to Turkey for four cen
turies and has played a promin
ent part in previous wars. Its
capture, if accomplished as re
ported, represents one of the few
definite accomplishments of the
Caucasian campaign.
London, Feb. 16. While France
and Flanders are the fields of military
activity that just now command chief
attention, the operations of the Rus
sians in their Caucasus campaign are
developing notable points of interest.
The newest development comes with
Petrograd's announcement of the cap
ture of nine of the forts of the Turkish
stronghold of Erzerum, the chief city
of Turkish Armenia.
Late last month the Turks were
driven back to the Erzerum defenses
and there have been reports that 80,
000 men were locked up in the city
with not more than two weeks' provi
sions. Reinforcements, however, were
•aid to be on the way, and may have
arrived.
Military critics link the operations of
the Russians in this campaign and
that in Persia with the British struggle
in Mesopotamia, pointing to possible
convergence of the allied forces. The
British armies for their part appear
to be making little progress.
Battle Is Important.
Not much attention was paid for
many months to the Caucasus cam
paign, the Russians apparently having
Ismail forces there. With the appoint
ment of Grand Duke Nicholas to the
chief command, however, It was hinted
that important developments might be
looked for. A dispatch from Amster
dam on February S said that Turkish
reinforcements, sent to the relief of
Erzerum, had been beaten off by the
Russians and that eighty wounded
Turkish officers and 5.000 wounded
men had arrived at Treblzond. An
Athens dispatch stated that the Turk
ish first army corps had been sent to
the relief of Erzerum, but could not
reach that city before the middle of
February.
The latest German note on the Lus
itania is before Secretary Lansing to
day. All the changes suggested by the.
American government, except one,
have been adopted In the new draft
and Teutonic officials here believe that
it will be entirely satisfactory to the
United States.
The Germans have shifted their of
fensive from the Artois and Cham
pagne regions In France to Belgium in
the neighborhood of Ypres where the
British are entrenched. By a contin
uous bombardment for two days with
artillery and by Infantry attacks the
Germans drove the British out of their
trenches over a distance of 800 yards.
Berlin claims that a majority of the
defenders of the trenches were killed
and that several dozens of soldiers
were taken prisoner. In the Artois,
Ltlle and Vosges regions, the French
and Germans are still flghtine: artil-
tlaveengagements,
ery but no notable gains
been reported by either side.
Berlin claims that two British war
ships were sunk off the Dogger bank
on February .10 .and that .they were of
a new type, built for mine and anti
aircraft service. The British admir
alty, however, reiterates its previous
statement that only one vessel was
sunk.
ALLIES ARE REPULSED.
Berlin. Feb. 16.—Three* attacks by
the British in efforts to recover the
trenches south of Ypres, in Belgium,
which they lost to the Germans, are
announced today by army headquar
ters. All the attacks are declared to
have been fruitless, as were those of
the French In attempts to regain
ground lost northwest of Tahure in
the Champagsa.

PLAN TO BUILD
UP IKE EMPIRE
EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO KEFP
DISCHARGED SOLDIERS FROM
COMING TO U. S.
London, Feb. 4—(Correspondence of
The Associated Press)—Sir Rider Hag
gard has left England on a trip aroui
the world, with a mission from the
Royal Colonial institute to investigate
the chances for empire building after
the war. His plan, backed by the in
stitute and Its important officials, In
cluding Lord Curzon, is prevent the
emigration to foreign c*antri:s of
soldiers and their families after the
war, and to direct steady streams of
these war veterans to the British col
onies—South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand, Canada and the man/ insular
colonies—thus recruiting the popula
tion with a sturdy and intelligent
class, and holding them vilhiu the
British empire.
It is the latest phase of the 'mperln!
movement which seeks to bind to
gether the mother country and tne
oversea dominions into a vast confed
eracy. The effect of the movement
would of course be to keep war emi
grants from going to the United
States or South American countries,
where their status as imperial citizens
would eventually be lost.
Sir Rider talked with The Associat
ed Press Just before starting on his
trip. While he is one of the interest
ing literary figures of England, he IK,
besides, a justice of the poac3 of hit
home town in Norfolk and a student
on land settlement, unemployment and
agriculture, and this qualill :a-ioii led
to his choice as commissioner for tue
royal institute to investigate the out
look for retaining war veterans within
the empire after the war. He gors
first to South Africa, then eastward to
the straits settlements, Australia New
Zealand, and will be in America next
summer or fall, going from the Faclfic
to the Atlantic, most of the time in
Canada, arranging for the influx of
war veterans and their families.
"I am going to inquire,-' said Sir
Rider, "into the possibilities the
British empire, or at any time of a
large portion of it, with referen to
land settlement and the employment
of ex-service men after tho war. It
is obvious that, during the turmoil and
change of conditions resulting from so
great a struggle, a large number of
men will become dlssastisflcl with
their former employment, especially
at the desk or counter, and wai wish
to begin a new life under new cir
cumstances, often overseas More
over, there will be many which tnis
climate will no longer suit aftei long
service and illness in the trenchos or
being 'gassed' to whom sunslune and
clear air will be a necessity. Experi
ence shows that after every great war
there is a rush of emigration. It hap
pened, to take the last instance, after
the Boer war. Men will go, and there
fore, it seems wise and statesmanlike
to try to retain them withm the
bounds of the empire."
EXPLANATION IS ASKED AS TO
WHY NEWS SENT BY WIRE
LESS WAS WITHHELD.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 16—The
German government through Count
von Bernstorff, its ambassador here,
today formally asked the United
States to explain why the American
wireless censors at Sayville suppress
ed the official announcement of the
German admiralty of the reported
sinking in the North sea of the Brit
ish cruiser Arabis on February 11.
News reporting the loss of the
Arabis reached the United States from
Berlin via London passing through
the British censorship. On Febru
ary 12, however, a Berlin wireless
direct via Sayville was passed, saying
that another ship in addition to the
Arabis had been sunk in the same en
gagement.
At the navy department it is ad
mitted that Berlin official dispatches
have been suppressed by the Sayville
censors because they considered them
coming under the inhibition of Sec
retary Daniels' orders permitting pas
sage of war dispatches "provided no
reference is made to movements or
location of war or other vessels of
belligerents."
It is explained that this order was
made in the .interest of neutrality.
The question probably will be taken
up by officials more fully.
THINK BODY M'NEELY'S.
Washington, D. C.. Feb. 16.—A body,
believed to bo that of Robert P. Mc
Neely, the younpr American consul who
lost his life when the British steamship
Persia was sunk by a submarine in the
Mediterranean, has been washed ashore

NNOTE
High Officials Confident
That Lusitania Matter
Will Be Settled
LATEST DRAFT IS
HANDED LANSING
Decision Up to President
Demands of the U. S. A.
Apparently Met
Washington, D. C., Feb. 16. Count
von Bernstorff today presented to Sec
retary Lansing the latest draft of the
Lusitania agreement, embodying the
changes suggested by the American
government and also one change sug
gested by Berlin. The indications were
that the agreement in its present form
probably would be acceptable to the
United States.
As now drawn and formally signed
by the German ambassador, the agree
ment is in reply to the last American
note.
It begins with reference to the for
mal assurances given by Germany last
September that submarines would not
sink unresisting liners without warn
ing and regard for the safety of life
aboard and that the instructions to
submarine commanders were so defi
nite as to allow no misunderstanding.
It then states that the submarine war
fare around the British isles was a re
prisal for what is characterized as the
"inhumane" blockade of Great Britain
to starve the central powers, and then
promises indemnity for Americans lost
on the Lusitania and expresses "pro
found regret for their deaths."
It goes on to say that the German
government, "recognizing liability" for
their loss, makes the proposals con
tained In the draft submitted today
and then goes on to deal with the ques
tion of reprisals figai'nst others than
enemy subjects. The change which
the Berlin foreign office has made in
the wording of the latter proposal has
not been publicly disclosed, but from
the air of optimism which prevailed
today there was a general impression
that the chances of its delaying the
negotiations were slight.
GRAIN FARMERS
ARE DEFENDED
Des Moines, Feb. 16.—Defense of
the grain farmer against the charge
that he is a "soil robber" was made
here today before the Farmers' Grain
Dealers' association of Iowa by Cyril
G. Hopkins of the department of the
agronomy of the University of Illinois.
"The decision between grain farm
ingjand live stock farming should be
based upon preferences and profit,"
said Professor Hopkins. "The world
does not live upon milk and meat.
There is need for bread and instead
of calling the grain farmer a 'soil rob
ber,' we should be just as ready to
encourage soil enrichment in grain
farming as in live stock farming.
"The common teaching that live
stock on the farm is essential for the
maintenance of soil fertility is entire
ly erroneous. It is also an erroneous
assumption that the manure produced
in live stock farming Is sufficient for
the permanent maintenance of fertil
ity on such farms.
"Animals and animal products are
not made out of nothing. Bone meal
is worth $25 or $30 a ton because of
the fertility it contains, and this fer
tility was taken from the soil by the
crops and removed from the crops by
the animals, not all of the fertility
in the crops fed being recovered In
the manurial excrements.
"A ton of clover may be harvested,
hauled to the bam, and fed to cattle
to produce 150 pounds Increase In the
live weight of cattle, worth perhaps
$12 or it may be plowed under with
out harvesting and thus fed to a suc
ceeding crop of wheat, perhaps In
creasing the yield by 15 bushels,
which at 80 cents a bushel is also
worth $12.
"Both the science of soil fertility
and the results of long continued farm
trials fully establish the fact that the
productive power of normal soil can
be maintained on grain farms as well
as on live stock farms, by means of
ground limestone, finely pulverized
natural phosphate rock and home
grown organic matter, which may be
farm manure or it may be legume
crops and crop residues plowed un
der."

STEAMERS LYING ALONGSIDE OF
PIER TAKING ON MUNITIONG
OF WAR, ALSO BURN.
New York, Feb. 16.—The British
steamships Bolton Castle and Pac'flc,
and a 900-foot pier belonging to the
New York Dock Co., at the foot of
Pioneer street, Brooklyn, were des
troyed early today by the most dis
astrous fire on the Brooklyn water
front in years. Another steamer the
Pallazia was damaged and about twen
ty-five scows and lighters wui'e arily
or wholly burned. Six hours after the
fire started, the police said they had
accounted for all but two coolies, and
it was believed the death list would be
limited to that number. The property
loss is estimated at considerably more
than $3,000,000.
The origin of the fire is unknown
but suspicions that it was incendiary
were aroused because of the fact that
some of the steamers were loading
with war munitions, some of which
were intended for shipment to the
Russian government and were to he
delivered at Vladivostok.
A watchman aboard the Bolton
Castle discovered that the buildings
on the pier were on fire soon after 1
o'clock this morning The bla~e
spread so rapidly that the officers nml
crews of the steamers and li^ht^rx
lying at the pier, after a vala effoit to
prevent the spread of the flames to
their vessels, were compelled oithei to
leap overboard or to seek safety
aboard lighters or tugs which hasten
ed to the rescue.
The three steamers lying at the pier
were surrounded by a fleet of ahout
fifty lighters and barges ou eafh of
which was one man or more. On
some of the barges were the wives and
families of the captains. Some them
were compelled to Jump overboard to
escape the swift rush of the flames.
Firemen and policemen dragged naany
of them out of the water tr adjoining
piers and others were rsecued by tug
boats or flreboats.
Capt. Benjamin Smith of the Bolton
Castle and six of his crew escaped
by crawling hand over hand on a rope
to a barge. Mrs. Smith fell into the
water but was rescued by sailers. AH
the rescued persons were given shel
ter on a nearby pier.
U. 8. CLUB BURNED.
Toronto, Ont., Feb. 16.—The $100,000
home of the American club, a social
organization of American residents in
Toronto, was destroyed by Are today.
The fire followed explosions, tne -ause
cf which has not been determined, but
the fact that the members of the club
have shown strong pro-ally sympathies
and that the ninety-seventh overseas
regiment, popularly known as the
American Jegion, had its blrtli there,
caused the police and military author
ities to suspect that the flro was the
result of a plot of alien enemiea.
INVESTIGATING FIRE.
Philadelphia, Pa., Feb. 16—Investi
gation Is being made today by cHy
authorities, officials of the Earn Line
Steamship Co., and the British oououl
ate to determine whether the fire
which damaged the sugar cargo of the
British steamship Dalton at a wharf
here last night was of incendiary
origin. The loss is placed at $100,u00.
The fire was the sixth to occur on
British steamers loaded with su^ar
within the last month.
Big Fire Down East.
Fall River, Mass., Feb. 16. Esti
mates made by owners of property and
proprietors of stores in a section of the
business district swept by fire early
today around Main and Spring streets
Indicated that the total loss would be
approximately $2,000,000. A score of
buldlings, inclding the Lenox apart
ment hotel, and several of the largest
retail stores in the city, including the
Steiger department store, were des
troyed and many others badly dam
aged. There was no loss of life and no
one was injured. The heaviest loss,
$600,000, was suffered by the Steiger
Dry Goods Co.

late last night of Gennaro Scrimmento,
a jeweler, is believed by the police to
be the first step in what they style a
"murder campaign," which officers be
lieve is to be inaugurated by a newly
organized band of gangsters and gun
men In Chicago's Italian district.
Scrimmento was shot near "death cor

avenues of escape available, has been
a favorite spot for murders which in
the past have been committed by the
so-called Cammorrists.
According to the police, it has been

REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF
NEW YORK 8TATE NAMES
NATIONAL DELEGATES.
New York, Feb. 16.—The republican
state convention today unanimously
adopted a platform intended for the
keynote for the republican national
campaign, endorsed the Whitman
state administration and named U. S.
Senator J. W. Wadsworth, Jr., Gov. C.
S. Whitman, Frederick Tanner, chair
man of the state committee, and State
Senator T. R. Brown, republican leader
in the senate, as the "big four" to rep
resent New Tork state in the national
convention.
Selection of Senator Brown as one
of the "big four" and the adoption of
the platform so as to segregate nation
al and state issues, Is regarded as a
victory by William BarneB and his
followers. The Whitman forces, how
ever, contend that the resolution en
dorsing the governor and his admin
istration, nevertheless is a partial vic
tory for them.
Prior to the opening of the conven
tion a proposal to submit to the dele
gates the name of Elihu Root as the
republican presidential candidate was
defeated In the committee on resolu
tions. Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler,
chairman, explained that It was not
thought wise to propose any resolution
of that character at this time.
Senator Wadsworth began his open
ing address shortly after 1 o'clock.
His declaration that the nation must
prepare, industrially for peace, and
that the only thing that will save it
from utter destruction commercially
is a protective tariff, caused an out
burst of applause.
