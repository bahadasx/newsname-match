EX-SUP,, HAMLETT
SUES FOR DIVORCE
Wife of Democratic Politician Al
leges Cruelty And Aikt
$10,000 Alimony.
Elizabethtown, Ky., Feb. 11.
Mrs. Daisy Hamlett filed suit
yesterday afternoon in Hardin
circuit court seeking divorce
from Rarksdale Hamlett, form
erly state superintendent of pub
lic instruction. The petition
charges cruel and inhuman treat
ment, which she alleges has con
tinued for a year. Mrs. Ham
lett asks the custody of their
three children and for $10,000
alimony. Mrs. Hamlett is now
with her parents in Elizabeth
town. Killed by Lightning Saturday.
Lightning killed four head of I
cattle and a fine mule on Seldon
Ainsworth' farm near Ford's
Ferry Saturday morning at 11:30.
There was a down pour of rain
here, but no one thought of elec
trical storm U this season which
is quite unusual. Some of the
cattle were at one end, and some
at the other end of the barn and
on opposite sides. The mule wa9
in the hallway, which shows the
stroke scattered and went in all
directions after etrikinz on the'
ridze of the bnm. Trio hma.t
was not injured. Mr. Ains
worth's friends sympathize w ith
him in this loss.

In our stock today then are hundreds of dollars worth of high
grade apparel and merchandise winter goods which must now be
closed out quickly in order to prepare for spring lines soon to come.
Because these surplus lines cover just such items as are most need
ed right now, the opportunity offered you is a most timely one as
prices have been brought down to a point where liberal buying is a
very judicious saving. Every item offered it worthy of the name
"bargain." -
WANTS LONGER
SCHOOL TERM
Supl. Travis Appeals to County
School Districts to Extend
Length of Term
There was a time when people
thought that three months in a
year were sufficient length for a
school term. Gradually it has
grown to seven months for rural
schools, and nine and ten for the
city and towns. May I pause
ri iKt here and ask, "Is the town
boy or the town girl entitled to
mure time, or better facilities for
securing an education than is the
country boy or girl?" No, but
if yjiiwill ask the tax-payer in
the town you will see where the
town child gets the advantage.
Nearly all the rural schools
that did not end last week will
end this week. The children will
nave little or no chance to con
tinue their school work. Of course
the time will not be wasted but
likely it will not be spent in the
most profitable manner. Hun
dreds of children in the county
will have nothing to do but
"pimp" and play until the schools
start again next August. Why
not the patrons of each district
get together and employ some
competent teacher to teach, at
least, two more months? It can
be done with very little individu-
al
or per capita cost, not more
than $1.50 per month. Should
tlvre r.ot be enough pucils in one
j disirict to pay a teacher to work,
! t"A districts or mavbe thr.'p ioin
in securing a teacher and let her
work in the house mont conven
ient. I will take the responsibil
ity to say that the County Roard
w 111 cheerfully pay the necessary
incidental expense while such a
school is being had.
There are not many things
that come by chance, or "happen

next spring. After all this he is
ready to start to school. Of course,
there is not much more of the '
school to come and the boy looks j
upon it as a sort of recreation or I
holiday, consequently, before thej
teacher can engage his best in-
terests in the work of the school
wn- omuui cnus. mis same Ear
ent will sometimes complain that
his children have not learned a
thing and the teacher is no good.
This sounds a little like talk,
at least, twenty years old, yet
some of these notions and prac
tices still exist in Crittenden
county. The results are that a
census taken last spring shows
four hundred and ninety-five per
sons over twenty years old are
unable to read and write. Oth
ers think that if their children
can complete the common branch
e3 by the time they reach their
majority that it is time enough
and all they need. Others think
that half of this ia enough. Oth
ers don't think at all. The most
phenomenal thing that has come
to me in my six years' experien
ce as County Superintendent oc
cured last fall when the father
of four children of the school age
sat a whole afternoon and dis
cussed with me how he might
evade the compulsory law and
keep his children out of school.
He went so far as to say that if
he were fined he would lay it out
in the county jail, then after he
got out it would be the same
thing over. He had no objection
to the teacher either.
To my nvnd this is no less a
( crime than robbery. We. have:

White I think this is the man
whojieyer sees any thing but the
dollar mark in the transaction, .
yet this same man can repay this
debt and follow the Golden Rule!
by raising another child and per
mitting him to avail himself of
the privileges and advantages of
the day in which he lives. If lie
willfully prevents him there is
no other that will fit the case so
well as "robbery." While there

is fat leaving the county. They

Clever Play to be Presented ly He
Jucior Class in School Auditor-
ium Friday Evening
Miss Abigail Tersons announces
the marriage of her neice Lucile
to Mr. Arthur Watson on Friday
Sept. 1, 1916 at the Persons resi
dence. Of course you want to learn
more about this wedding; s o
come to the school auditorium
Friday evening,' Feb. 18, for on
that date the Junior class of the
M. H. S. will present "Engaged
Ry Wednesday." This ia a very
clever little play filled with sur
prises nom me nrsi to me last.
The plot is unusually i.Terest
ing, full of love and spiced -vith
lover's quarrels. Martin Henr.',
the laziest man in the state ia
slower than "Joe Slocum" ever
could be. Miss Abigal Persons,
the old maid is certainly a worn-.
an with ideas who always tnana---ges
to have them materialize.
about truer lovers than Arthur
Watson and Lucile Persons. In
fact the entire cast is well suited
to the parts assigned them. ,
Since the Juniors are noted for
"doing things" we feel safe in
saying that this wiil be one of V
the most pleasing entertainments
