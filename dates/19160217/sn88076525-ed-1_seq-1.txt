TO BE BUILT
BAIRD-BICE-HALEY LET CON
.TRACT TO FOSBURG FOR NEW
MODERN BLOCK.
Probably the finest building to be
erected in this city during 1916, will
be the modern three story building,
which is to be erectel in connection
with the present Wineman block at
the corner of Fourth St. and Kelly
Avenue.
This block is owned by Messrs.
Baird and Bice and Miss N. J. Haley
of the First National Bank. The
new building will be 140 50, three
stories with full basement and an
other story will be added to the pres
ent Wineman block. The first foor
will be occupied by stores, the second
floor will be offices and the third
floor will consist of modern flats. This
will be one of the most modern build
ings in the city, and nothing in the
way of conveniences will be spared.
Christian religion in foreign coun
tries. The next on the program was
Rev. C. E. Stinson of the Methodist
church of this city and in a fifteen
minute talk he told of what was go
ing on relative to foreign missions
and the giving for church and mission
work. His talk was a very impres
sive one and was heartily received by
those present. The last speaker on
the program was Rev. Quigley, Super
intendent of the Methodist church of
this district. Rev. Quigley is a
pleasing and able talker and ability
to hold the close attention of his lis
teners is one of the pleasing parts of
his address. He gave a splendid talk
after which he favored the audience
with a solo. This.closed the meeting
and Rev. A. C. Barron of this city
pronounced the benediction.
The speakers had attended the lay
men's meeting at Fargo, and the ob
ject of this meeting was especially to
tell something of church work and
what was done at that great gather
ing at Fargo. It was a very pleasant
occasion and was heartily enjoyed by
the large number present.
LACKED NERVE
ILLINOIS OFFICER FORCES SAFE
BREAKER TO YIELD BOTTLE
OF NITROGLYCERIN.
Danville, 111., Beb. 14.—When po
licemen Kelly and Moore surprised two
men in the act of blowing a safe in
the office of a coal company tonight
the man seized by Kelly raised a bot
tle of nitroglycerin aloft and threat
ened to dash it to the ground and
blow them both up unless released.
"Let her go we'll both go together",
replied Kelly as he pressed his re
volver against the burglar's breast.
The crook's nerve failed him and he
carefully delivered the explosive to
the officer.
The other burglar pressed a revolver
at Officer Moor's body, but it was
brushed aside by that officer, and he
was also subdued. The burglars gave
their names as George McDonald and
Harry O'Brien. Their arrest will, it
is believed, clear up several safe
blowings in surrounding towns recent
ly.
LOCAL CREAMERY
WINS PRIZE
Berg Madison, who is the butter
maker at the Danvang creamery at
this place scored second prize for Gut
ter at the dairyman's association meet,
ing recently held at Jamestown, Lis
butter scored .93, and for a prize he
got a fine Jersey bull calf. This speaks
well for the local creamery, as there
was a large number of entries and
competition was close.
WORLD—VOLUME VI. NUMBER 7 DEVILS LAKE, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1916
HELD YESTERDAY CLUB TO CIVE
The Men's banquet at Guild hall last
evening proved a success from every
standpoint. It was nearly seven
o'clock before all arrived and they
proceeded to the banquet hall of the
church where an elegant supper was
served by the ladies of the Guild.
There were nearly one hundred seated
at this banquet, and the same was
thoroughly enjoyed. When the meal
was over the male quartette rendered
a couple of fine selections after which
there were short talks Prof. Nelson
Suvain acted as toastmaster and af
ter stating the object of the gather
ing, he introduced Rev. R. Blackford,
of Minnewaukon, who gave a very
nice talk of about fifteen minutes
duration. Next came Rev. F. H.
Oehler of the Episcopal church of this
city, who told of the great laymen's
meeting recently held at Fargo, and
in his usual happy, yet forceful man
ner he drove home some important
facts relative to the churches of this
country and what they were doing
for the community and the country
at large as well as spreading the
Next Monday evening, February 21,
there will be another of those pleasant
gatherings at the club rooms of the
Commercial club. There will be short
talks by different speakers present
and a lunch and smoker will be en
joyed afterwards. All members are
requested to be present and join in
having a pleasant evening.
THREATENS TO
President Grace ofthe Bethlehem
Steel Company, told the Senate Navel
Affairs Committee a few deys ago that
if the Tillman Government Armor
Plate bill was passed by Congress he
would recommend to the stockholders
of his company the dismantling of
their armor plate plant.
"I am postive for our own company,
if we are to be continually confronted
with the character of legislation, that
we had better direct our energies in
making investments in more substan
tial lines where we would have the
whole world for customer instead of
depending upon one no-policy custom
er," said President Grace.
The annual meeting of yard man
agers, and others connected with the
Bovey-Schute Lumber Co. in this state
met in annual convention in this city
Tuesday and the meeting will last un
til tomorrow. There is quite a large
number in attendance, and among
those present are John A. Bovey, pres
ident of the company, and F. A. Tay
lor, manager of the Minneapolis office.
Their meeting place is the large room
on the main floor of the Great North
ern hotel, originally used for the din
ing room. The aim of this meeting
is to plan business matters for the
coming year and to exchange views on
different subjects connected with the
lumber business, and it is an annual
affair of this company
ZTJET lanEiitaus
AND INTER-OCEAN
The stockholders of the Munich Co
operative Creamery have held* their
regular annual meeting, and it was
well attended. The following officers
were elected for the ensuing year:
Aug. Korb, Pres. Ludwig Hoffman,
Vice Pres. Jos. Goeser, Treas, P. J.
Antony, Sec. W. J. Gilchrist, direct-
The above five comprise the
board of directors.
It was decided at this meeting to
lease the creamery to some reliable
butter maker for a term of two years
without charge. With the under
standing that such party will operate
the creamery, keep the creamery in
sured, pay taxes and keep the proper
ty up in reasonable condition. The
secretary was instructed to advertise
for such a man, and if no one can be
found it more than pr9bable that the
stockholders will operate the cream
ery themselves.
It was also decided to make a can
vas of the country and ascertain as to
the number of cows that would pat
ronize the creamery. In this move
every stockholder agreed to do their
share.
The secretary is already in touch
with several first class butter makers,
and it is reasonable to believe that a
deal will be made with someone, as
this looks like a good proposition.
The nearest creamery in operation is
across country in Cando, 30 miles and
Langdon 28 miles, but whether Lang
don creamery operated last summer
we do not know. Some farmers in
Egeland shipped their cream by train
to the Cando creamery last summer.
Arrangements, ro doubt, can be made
with the towns *i the line, Clyde, Cal
vin and Sarles ship their cream to
this creamery, also the towns down I
the line. Weaver, Hampden, Derrick,
Edmore, Lawton, Brocket and possibly
Lakota. Also the Soo east and west
could ship their cream to the Soo spur
and could he hauled from there to the
creamery here.
It is a reasonable certainty that the
creamery will run this season. This is
a good move, and should be boosted
along by both business men and far
mers. It is a good move for the
country as a whole, and no doubt, can
be made a success by everybody put
ting their shoulders to the wheel and
pushing.
Butcher Honnef is packing the ice
house with ice, more than he needs for
his business so that he can divide up
with the creamery man.—Munich Her

LENDING
PARTY FOR
THE YOEMEN
Next Tuesday evening the Yoemen
lodge of this city will give their 19th
anniversary party in the Odd Fellows
hall. Invitations are out and all the
necessary arrangements have been
made for a pleasant time.
TURNER'S STORE
HAS A EIRE
As Harry Maher was passing along
Kelly Ave., early Monday morning he
discovered fire in the Turner confec
tionery store and immediately gave
the alarm. The fire department hur
ried to the scene, broke open the front
door, and soon had the flames under
control, but not until they had eaten
their way entirely thru the south wall.
The blaze started right back of the
stove and near the wall, but as there
was no fire in the stove it is thought
to have caught by a match or cigar
stub having been dropped onto a mop,
which was standing behind the stove
and the fire smouldered practically all
night before it got a good start. The
building is a small frame structure,
and had the fire department not acted
promptly it might have been a fine
blaze. Considerable damage was done
both to building and stock.
At Minnewaukan Tuesday aftcnoon
occurred the funeral of Mrs. Mary J.
Buttz, mother of Judge C. W. Buttz,
of this district. This estimable !ac!y
had been ill for some time and passed
away after patient suffering. The
funeral was largely attended by peo
ple from Minnewaukan and Benson
county. The remains were shipped to
Lisbon, this state, the former home of
of the Buttz family, and were interred
at that place. The deceased leaves
two sons, Judge Buttz and W. L. Buttz
who is a druggist at Harvey.

NEW MILLINERY

Announcement is made by Mrs. Jes
sie Gillen, that in the early spring she

ery store in this city. She has re

will arrive here next month. She has
had years of experience in this line
and her knowledge of the trade will
recommend her to the millinery trade.
INTER-OCEAN—VOr 'III. NUMBER 37
It is reported that Edmore will have
anew lumber yard in the near future.
At present they have only one yard,
owned by one of the line companies,
and many farmers in that section of
the county feel that they are called
upon to pay exhorbitant prices for
their lumber, and that very little ac
commodation is shown here. At one
time Edmore had three lumber yards
and they were all doing a good busi
ness, but in order to head off compe
tition one line company has secured
control of the lumber business at that
village. If there is any thing that
Edmore needs it is another lumber
yard.

The Gale theater which was opened
ip in the Glerum block some time ago,
seems to be a thing of the past. This
playhouse has had a very unsuccessful
career since it started and has chang
ed hands a couple of times. The last
one to run it was A. H. Yoemans, and
he was unable to make both ends meet
and when the time for closing came
his father stepped in and took the out
fit on a mortgage which he held
tion by Glerum, who owns the build
ing, and the result was Yoemans
lodged a complaint against the Gler
ums for assault and battery, and in
the meantime Yoemans has been
spending a few days in the hospital.
What the final outcome is remains to
be seen.
According to an order issued by
Judge Buttz, on complaint of Chief
of Police Timboe, Sheriff Olson and
deputies caused a search of the pool
room which is conducted by John
Schultz. Although a thorough search
was made the sheriff was unable to
find anything in the line of intoxicat
ing liquors in the main room or the
basement, and there fore the place was
not closed as was reported on the»
streets Tuesday.
