Is He "Two-Faced?"
A man said of a prominent politician the other day,
"He is two-faced."
What does that mean? It means that he will not tell
his true opinion or speak out his true intentions. He
will talk to you about some public measure and Rive you
to understand that he is in favor of it, and yet when he is
talking with somebody else he will give him to under
stand that he is against it. That means he has two
mouths.
The two-faced man, perhaps, is a coward. He does
not want to tell you to your face that he is opposed to the
things of which you are in favor.
And, perhaps, he is treacherous like an Indian. He
does not want to stand in the open. He wishes to put
you off your guard. He gives you to understand that he
is in favor of the things you desire then goes and works
against them behind your back and in the bushes.
r politics have been a great school of treachery. Many
(J politicians have been two-faced. We hope a better day
is coming, and that an increased number of our public
men will have principles which they are not afraid to
speak out and stand for. A man who has faith in right
eousness and truth and his fellowman never wants to carry
his measure by any two-faced methods.
Sometimes people are tempted to be two-faced in
family matters and neighborhood matters, and school
matters and even in church matters!

Company. It is reported that the
Rockefeller Interests are behind the
'big merger and that they have made
j it possible for the reorganization of

up In the detective bureau, formally
charged with conspiracy to commit

The arrest came alter a day of

arsenio Into the soup served at the
dinner to Archbishop Mundelien.
An amazing discovery came with
the man's arrest. In a pocket was
found the detailed technical sketch of
a bomb. Also there was a letter, one
of several referring to bombs. That

against church as well as state, ap

ANALYSIS OF POISONED SOUP.
Chicago. Four hundred and eighty
grains of arsenic were In the soup with
which, police believe, Jean Crones
tried to poison the guests at the ban
quet given at the University club to
the prominent Chlcagoans In honor of
Archbishop George W. Mundeleln. Dr.
Frederick A. Tonney, director of the
city laboratory, completed his quali
tative analysis of tho soup and found
that the poison averaged one and one
half grains to each three ounces ol
soup. The portion served each guest
at the banquet was between three and
four ounces, so that each one who
finished his soup took between one
and a half snd two grains of arsenic.
The analysis shows that the guests
narrowly escaped death.

sult of the series of notes which the
United States has been sending to

Changes in the English Cabinet
during the week indicate that
Lord Kitchner is to be rellieved of
some of the important duties of
his office as War Minister, possibly
with the object of making it pos
sible for him to take the field in

conditions in the east, where the
war Is shifting at present, than any
other man, and most of the service
which has given him his great re
putation has been performed in tho

The news Kerns of the week In
dicate the existence of a revolution
in southern China. This has been
forming for some time apparently
as a protest against the turning of
the republic into an empire. The
revolution has not gained much
headway as yet, but a disturbance
in China at the prestnt time would
be an event of great importance and
might easily set in motion changes
that would be far reaching and of
derided interest to the United States,
It is repotted that Germany has
bought up all the rattle on tho
market in the Argentine Republic
in South America. This has been
done in anticipation of future wants
an!perhaps with the idea of hold
ing on to commercial relations with
South American countries. There
are a great many Germans living in
the Argentine, in Brazil, in Venezu
ela, and other countries of South
America and they have large in
terests there.
