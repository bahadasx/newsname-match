Nkght Marshal Klsh Refuses to
ccpt Discharge nt Hands of
Chief Chas. Jeffen
Ac-
IS SUSPENDED FENDING IX-
V INSTIGATION BY COUNCIL
Charges and Counter Charges Being
Made In Official Circles but
No Suits Are Filed
Abundant protection was given the
citizens of Alliance Monday night
when Night Marshal L. L. Kish, who
refused to accept a discharge at the
bands of Chief Jeffers, patrolled one
side of Box Butte avenue all night,
and Ed Eldred, who had been given
a temporary appointment lo succeed
Kish, patrolled the other side of the
street.
Ill feeling has existed between
some of the officials in the city police
department since the stockmen's con
vention last summer when an argu
ment arose as to the proper method
of handling the crowds. This affair
found Its culmination in circumstanc
es incident to a number of raids
planned by the city officials lately in
which some one on the inside "tipped
off" those in charge of the places to
be raided and in the evidence brought
to light in the investigation of the
robbery of Robert Maivocht, the
German laborer, by Ray Thompkins
recently at the Atlas hotel.
Monday night when Marshal Kish
reported at the city hall for duty.
Chief Jeffers told him to turn over
bB star and keys to Mr. Eldred.
"Who said so?" asked Kish.
"I do," replied Jeffers.
"Anybody else say so?" asked
Kish.
"No. not that I know of," answer
ed Jeffers.
"Then that don't go with me."
said Kish. who called up Mayor Ro
mig and bad quite a little ennversa
tion with him on the telephone.
Kish then went on duty without
any further parleying with the chief
and remained on duty that night
while Jeffers supplied Eldred with
the proper equipment and he also
went on duty.
The following morning Mayor Ro
nilg served written notice on Mar
shal Kish that he was suspended
pending an investigation by the city
council of the poller- department ant
the charges and counter charges
which have been made and the evl
' dence reported to be avajlable from
the several prisoners and witnesses
who are implicated in the robbery of
Maivocht.
There is no truth in the report cir
culated the first of the week 1hat
warrants had been issued charging
Mayor Romig and Chief Jeffers with
accepting bribe money from any of
the law breakers of the city, and
both of these officials have stated em
phatically that their conduct in of
Ice is such that they have no fear
whatever of any investigation which
may arise as a result of the circul
ating of reportB. the Issuing of war
rants or from any evidence that may
be brought to light in a campaign for
a clean-up of the alleged rottenness
existing in certain quarters and
among the members of any gang in
the city.
Marshal Kish also denies any im
plication whatever in any deal in a
manner unbecoming an officer of the
law.

T. P. A. SERVICES SUNDAY
Members of Ivocal Order T. 1. A. At
tend Christ lau Church Service
in a llody, Sunday Night
Members of Post M of the Travel
ers Protective Association- attended
the Christian church in a body last
Sunday morning. Rev. Young is the
chaplain of the local post and the oc
casion was the annual memorial serv
ice. The church was decorated in
the colors of the order, with a large
welcome sifcii anu) lue hiiij ui luc
.i . . ; . . . i. . . . . 1. n . 1.
Mr. Young took for his subject
"The Man Ahead". He spoke of the
piece which the commercial traveler
holds at the head of the progressive
commercialism. His ready knowl
edge of the business game and his
timely suggestions to the local mer
chant of every town as to new ines lowlnR tne reKular meeting of the lo
of goods as well as new methods of cal ,odge number 168- A lar
marketing the same. r cry praise- rnwri attended the lortte meetlnu at
worthy mention was made of the re-;
gard for honesty and for the real ob-
servanee of the square deal in the j
dealings of the traveling fraternity
as well as the wholesale houses back
of them. After a few appropriate !
remarks along these lines Mr. Young ;
then spoke of the Man of Galilee as
the man ahead of every good thing. I
There are some folks, he said, who;'r,H
consider that the teachings and the;
program or tne i imsi are oeninu i
these progressive times but these (
people are mistaken, for the trouble1
has been that we have never been
able to catch up with the Christ close j
cnouKh to get anything more than a
tail-light view of what his teachings!
reallv are. There will never be a
time this side the Millenium when
we will be in advance of the program
cf Christ.
Then the speaker outlined the
teachings of Christ under three heads
or points, viz.: The Law of Love; The
Law of Liberty, and the Law of Ac
tivity. Under the Law of Iove was
revealed all the fraternalism of the
Brotherhood of Man and the direc
tion of the Fatherhood of God. The
newer consideration of employees on
the part of great industries and by
the country in general, all the Indi
cations of a kindlier consideration of
our fellows are all born of the work
ing of the principles of ibe lw of
Love as taught by Jems Christ. The
Law of Liberty reveals man's right
to his own interpretation of the
teachings of God to make the appli
cation of the same to his own life as
he tees he individually needs. Lib
ert v. freedom from the bondage of
sin and in the use of God's grace
-t th- life of the Christian. The
Law of Activity is the working out
of uie principles of the first two laws.
Th positive activity of the follower
of the Man of Galilee always leads to
positive results. To be busy in the
cause of righteousness keeps a man
away from crime and evil of all sorts
and will always get results of the
better sort. With the enactment oi
, program ef Christian activity there
...nlli(i np ,10 wttrs. no divorces, no
penitentiaries, no houses of correc
tion, no children homeless because of
the weaknesses of parents, in short,
thi re would be u very great cessation
of th" things that make for misery
