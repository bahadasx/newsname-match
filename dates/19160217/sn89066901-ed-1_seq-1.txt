Mining' News
The old Dodson mines and new
property being opened by a Jop
lin mining company Rives pro
raise of being an important pro
ducer, and we are glad . to learn
that Mansfield has been selected
as permanent Headquarters, for
this company. With the present
high prices of ore as special in
ducement these people expect to
work their mines for all that
they can be made to yield. Fol
lowing is the latest mineral quo
tation: 1
Blende, $95 to 1125; average
basis, $110. ,
Calamine firm at $55 to $87,
Pig lead to $6.25.
W. C. Dolby of StUlwell, Okla.,
and J. C. Thornton, of Joplin,
Mo., arrived from Joplin Mon
day of' this week, representing a
mining company composed of
other prominent experienced
m ine rs. , They are preparing to
begin operation on some 2000
acres they hard leased for a per
iod of 10 years, which includes
mining properties formerly
known as the Dodson Mining Co.
and other land. An Old time
mining man said recently: "The
worst fault with mining in this
section is not in the properties,
but in the managment of them
Messrs Dolby and Thornton
will be in the field making exten
sive preparations, liiey are
both experienced mining mon,
and will be at the Martin Gas
kill farm for the present. These
mines will produce principally
calamine or silicate, and it is a
sheet ground proposition at
which operations will be con
ducted at a depth of 195 feet to
300 feet. At the present prices
of ore it will be possible to make
these mines pay, and at the same
time prospect for lead and jack
in greater abundance. It is
planned to re-open all the pro
perties and push development
harder than ever before as soon
as the weather will permit. The
operators are planning to install
larger boilers and pumps, and
ore will be ready for the market
soon,
On next Tuesday another
member of this company, Mr.
M. Rosenberg, of Joplin, will vis
it Mansfield, and will be accom
panied by the Joplin postmaster,
Congressman Pearl Decker, W.
B. Storegh and others, all exper
ienced miners. M. Rosenberg
is at the present time' president
of a mining company in the Jop
lin district. P. W. Newton and
Dr. Riley, in behalf of the Young
Men's Business Club of Mans
field, have extended to these
gentlemen a hearty welcome, and
will give them every assistance
possible.
We are glad to report that the
Burney Shaft" will be in opera
tion soon, and the "Gulch Mine",
owned by Rufus Chandler, is
showing signs of being a paying
proposition. :: The new Joplin
mining company will have tem
porary headquarters at Dr. Ri
ley's office, and any desired in
formation, address of auy mem
ber, J any questions will be
answered by calling at that office.
Much prospecting on a small
scale has proven that there is
ore here in paying quantities,
and this new company proposes
to work until they produce the
"true fissure," which experienc
ed miners claim lies witbin our
reach. Mining men say we have
it underlying Mansfield, the Gem
City of the Osarks.
W. O. Williams, northeast of
town, has lately discovered at
bis cave veins of .magnesia. He
says it is as wax. This is used
as a medicine and if he discovers
a body of it, it would make him
rich.
Hugh Williams, southwest of
town, has dug a shaft eight feet
into a round cave , cavity. This
is supposed to be a chimney; if
Hugh follows this down he may
get into some rich mineral.
E. P. and W. J. Gaskill, broth
ers, have out one ton on the same
run of silicate. They say it tests
$35 a ton. This is better ore

Obituary
Allie J. Wilson was born
Jan. 7, 1829, and departed this
life Feb. 12, 191 G, age 87 years, 1
month and 5 days. She was
married to William H. Hopper in
her 24th year; to this union was
born nine children six girls and
three boys, two boys and one
girl preceeded her to the world
beyond. The five living children
were all present when she passed
away.
Sister Hopper professed faith
in Christ when a girl. She first
joined the Methodist church, lat
er in Oct. 21, 1880, she, with her
family joined the C. P. church at
Pleasant Valley and remained a
member of this church until
death.
Sister Hopper became a Chris
tian when a young girl. She
married a wicked man and the
children all grown the mother
being the only Christian in the
borne. She went to the Lord- in
prayer every day for her family.,
When the first girl was converted
she said : I thought they were a
lost." One by one she won all her
children and husband to Christ
in answer to the prayers of a
Christian mother. The husband
passed away 8 years ago; since
then Grandma . has made her
home with her children. How-
ever.she was never satisfied long
at a time. On last Thanksgiving
she called it her happiest day for
years. 1 visited her in her room
at her sons, Judge Hopper. She
said this world is so lonesome to
me, I am lonely all the time and
I want to go home and I am go
ing in a short time and when I
die I want you to preach my fu
neral and tell the people that I
have gone home to glory.
When she was taken sick she
was moved to her son-in law,
Henry Tarbutton's, where she .
lingeredT-several weeks, meekly
enduring her suffering until last
Saturday morning at 6 o'clock
she quietly past to her eternal
Home. The writer preached a
brief funeral sermon in the home
to the children, grandchildren
and neighbors, using for a text
Rev. 11:13, assisted by Bro. An
drew Ross of the Baptist church
and Sister Sarah Gaskill, after
which the remains were followed
to the Newton cemetery and
layed to rest beside those of her
husband and son. Thus a moth
er has passed away; the greatest
legacy that, a mother can leave
her cbildrenis a well spent Chris
tian life. So - this mother has
gone and left us, may her mantle
fall on her daughters and many
others is the prayer of the writ
er. JOSEPH DAVIS.
Robert Dave Alford, youngest .
child of R. L. Alford and wife,
passed away Saturday morning.
He was born June 27, 1913, and
was 2 years, 7 months and 15
days old. Funeral services were
held from the Mansfield Baptist
church at 2;30 p. m. .Sunday con
ducted by the pastor, Rev. J. M.
England ; interment in the Mans
field cemetery. He is survived
by his parents, two sisters and
one brother, besides numerous
other relatives.
Robert was a bright and joyful
little child the delight of his
parents' hearts and a ray of sun
shine in the home.
As neighbors of the family.the
Mirror family became closely at
tached to the little fellow, who
was a frequent visitor to the edi
torial home and we shall indeed
miss him. He was always glad
to go over to Blacks and always
loath to leave. While of course
no one will miss him as much as
his parents, sisters and brother,
we also feel deeply his death.and
can in an unusually large degree
sympathize with the family in
their, bereavement. Since tho
time he first began to talk and to
walk, he was always coming to ,
meet us and up until his last ill
ness his childish prattle was a
source of delight
Mrs. James Hight died at her
home here Monday; interment"
Tuesday. The obituary will ap
pear next week.
