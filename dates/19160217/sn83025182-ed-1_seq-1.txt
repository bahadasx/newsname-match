NEW YORK. Feb 17.—Has the long
anticipated big offensive begun along
the western front? Are the dally
smashes in Artois and Champagne the
prelude to an early attempt to pierce
the lines and the start of a drive to
ward Paris, Calais or Cologne? If not,
what is the meaning of the hot fight
ing now going on in France?
Despite the continuous pounding of
artillery all along the line, and the
spirited clashes of infantry for the
possession of certain trenches, indica
tions are the big offensive on either
side is still some distance off. Ap
parently both Germany and the allies
are jockeying for position, playing
for the inside track. As at a horse
race where the field is large, the
ponies young, high strung and nerv
ous. maneuvering for the get-away is
likely to be rather long and tedious,
with some false starts.
There Is no doubt but that Germany
is expecting the allies to launch a
terrific punch against her in the
spring. T^iis blow, she reasons, after
looktng at the map, is likely to fall in
Champagne and in Artois, north of
Arras, or that vicinity.

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
PETROGRAD, Feb. 17-—The great
eat demonstration since the capture of
Przemysl oocurred in Petrograd to
day, following confirmation of reports
of the capture of Erzerum.
Great crowds marched through the
streets waving the Russian colors and
chanting hymns. Thousands attended
te deum services In the great Kazan
cathedral while other thousands,
standing outside in the snow, offered
up prayers for the Grand Duke Nich
olas, again the national hero.
The conquest of Erzerum, the first
important Russian victory since the
retreat from the Carpathians began
nearly a year ago, has stirred the Rus
sian people to great depths of pat
riotism.
The newspapers today declared the
grand duke's triumph only the pre
lude to greater victories that wl|l
carry the czar's armies sweeping back
through Poland and Galicia before
summer.
Because of meagre communications
with the Caucasus region, details of
the final fighting preceding the fall of
the great Turkish fortress are lacking
here. One dispatch said thiait the
Turks were fleeing westward, aban
doning part of their artillery. This
was taken to mqan that the larger
part of the Turkish garrison, various
ly estimated at from 80/000 to 160,000
men, has escaped.
The capture of Erzerum means the
collapse of all Turkish plans of con
quest In Persia, military men here be
lieve and possibly will force the Turks
to abandon their plans to Invade
Egypt. With a British army soon to
be heavily reinforced, fighting only
110 miles from Bagdad and the grand
duke's forces moving westward
through Armenia in a spring drive, it
is not believed here that Enver Pasha
will risk sending large forces to the
Suez.
Cossack squadrons, It Is assumed
here, are pressing the retreating
Turks who must continue
..thai fllcht
for'TSsvera! days "Before arriving at
any base where they can make a
stand. The grand duke's main forces
probably will be halted within the
walls of Erzerum for several days, re
cuperating frorn-ttie hardships of the
campaign of the snows.
AFTER FIVE BAYS SIEGE.
LONDON, Feb. 17.—Between 30,000
and 100,OOO Turkish troops and large
numbers of guns were captured by
the grand duke's forces when they
entered the Turkish fortress of Er
zerum, according to unofficial reports
received from Petrograd this after
noon.
The war office had received no ad
ditional despatches from the Russian
commander and was unable to verify
these reports. It was estimated that
about 100,000 Turks comprised the
garrison of the captured fortress and
that more than 1,000 guns were
mounted on the various forts. There
is nothing to indicate, however, how
many of the Turks succeeded in mak
ing their escape.
The fact that the city fell within
five days after the Russians began
storming the forts, .makes it appear
possible that the figures, both In men
and guns were large. Means of exit
from Erzerum under ordinary circum
stances are very meagre, and with
the city virtually surrounded by Rus
sian troops in the last few days of
fighting and heavy snows making
highways impassable, it is believed
thousands of Turkish troops were un
able to make their way to safety.
The gun captures In Erzerum may

What Can be Expected
on Batdefield This Spring
like the letter L. If the German line
can be broken over an extended
front along the bottom of the (in
Champagne) and along the top of the
L. (around Arras) the forces holding
the corner will have to retire, even
though unattacked, lest they be cut
off by a junction of the two drives
beginning in Champagne and Artois.
This is probably the explanation of
the frenzied attacks hurled by the
Germans against the allies in these
two regions. They wish to prevent
the French getting a good toe-hold
from which' to make the spring. Last
September the French worked several
weeks digging additional trenches
back of their first line in Champagne,
facilitating the move which resulted
in a gain of some three miles along
fifteen mile front. The Germans are
undoubtedly to harass the allies to
such an extent by dally and nightly
attacks, that such preparatory work
may not proceed without hindrance.
On the other hand, the French are
undoubtedly prepared for a big Ger
man offensive. It is believed inevit
able. It is said in Paris that German
public opinion at home will demand
action in the western theatre of war
and French plans have beyond any
doubt, been made to meet the attaok.

German Marks Slump.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
LONDON, Feb. 17.—Capture of Er

record breaking slump in the price
of the German mark, according to
dispatches from Amsterdam today.
This may come somewhere in the Ar
tois or In the Flanders region, in an
effort to reach the Channel In the
Compiegne, Soissons or Champagne
districts with Paris as the objective,
or both may come together. Or—and
surprise in France would not be
great were this to prove true—the
Germans might seek a new route to
Paris from the eastern rontier. in
any event it seems little likely that
any really serious offensive will be
undertaken by either side until the
weather man turns on enough good
weather to make the handling of ar
tillery easy. The European war
backbone is composed of big guns and
field pieces and stupenduous numbers
of them are absolutely necessary to
dynamite an army's way forward. Too.
these guns need ammunition in hither

ANARCHIST EXPRESSES REGRET
THAT HIS PLOT FAILED
Jean Crones is Hiding in New
York and Writes Letter
to Newspaper.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.—Somewhere
in New York, Jean Crones is in hid
ing today in the belief of the police,
enjoying the game of eluding capture
and perhaps planning further acts of
anarchy.
The search for the man wanted
In connection with the poisoning or
more than 100 banqueters at the Uni
versity club, Chicago, narrowed to
New York and the outlying districts
whon a letter reached a New York
newspaper today signed "Jean
Crones." It purported to tell exactly
how the Cnicagoans were poisoned at
a banquet in honor of Archbishop
Mundelein.
Captain Tunney of the bomb squad
threw all available facilities of the
police department into the anarchist
hunt. Tunney already has verified
the statement In the letter that
rones worked in a restaurant on
Ptaten Island in 1913 and has learned
that the writer instead of being a
chemist was only a novice at that
science. Tunney was especially con
cerned with the presence of Crones
as long as the man remains at lib
erty. "When I go I will take a good
manv others," said Crones. "I'm
smrv that not all or at least 100
were killed at the banquet, the world
would have been happier without
them."
Captain Tunney believed the letter
to be from Crones himself. No one
pise, Tunney believed, could have had
such intimate knowledge of the pois
oning or of the condition of Crones
room in Chicago where the police
found anarchistio literature and cans
of what they believed to be gun cot
ton. The letter said the material
was asbestos, not gun cotton, and an
other Inspection by cnicago analye
tlst confirmed his statement.
I did not have anything to do
with the soup," said the letter,
touching on a report that arsenic had
been found in the soup served at the
function. "I put a little bit in differ
ent dishes. I have taken up chemis
try at correspondence schools and
made good progress. As I love science
and hate religion and as I had seen
the menu twelve days in advance, I
thought it was a sanitary thing to
make a good clean up."
Letter Is Genuine.
CHICAGO, Feb. 17.—The letter re
ceived by New York newspapers
signed Jean Crones is a genuine con
fession of the suspected arch poisoner
in the anarchist soup plot, police de
clared today. Capt. Morgan Coilin
and other officers who have been
working on the plot today said that
the New York letter in which the
writer admitted poisoning tne soup
at the banquet for Archbishop Mun
delein last Thursday night contains
misspelled words identical with words
found in other letters written by
Crones.
Search for Crones shifted to New
York today. Chicago detectives were
sent there to aid in running him
down. Police here were confident that
the alleged anarchist under an as
sumed name and his appearance
changed by disguise, is working as a
chef in some New York restaurant, or
hidden by anarchist friends.
Police refused to believe Crones'
statement in uie letter that he had
uone
ffi
his work alone." Their search
for alleged accomplices proceeded
with doubled energy today.
