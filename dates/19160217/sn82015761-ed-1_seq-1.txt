Loan Him a Few Bits, Please?
someone has suggested that it
would be an act of kindness to
ward the reading public if some
kind friend would loan the
editor of the Coconino Sun a few
"bits" to pay his "war Taxes" for
a year or two in advance. From
. the noise he is making about this
small direct tax, many of his clos
est friends are beginning to fear
that he will be driven to distrac
tion if not to some worse form of
mental disorder unless he is" ' re
lieved of this great worry.
And for humanity's sake, . please
don't anybody so much as suggest
to him what a large sum of
indirect tax he paid under high
tariff. Especially be careful not
to remind him how much he paid
to our various "infant industries''
the steel, trust, and .theregt; 2 o.
'em in the form of increased pri.
ces made poesible by protection
during Republican administrations.

EVENING SERVICE AT
THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH
At the Episcopal Church last
Sunday it was decided to try
having Sunday evening services
part of the time in place of the
morning service. It is thought
that there may be a number
who find it difficult to come in
the morning, who will be glad to
come in the evening. As there
wilf be no morning services the
same day, it is hoped to have a
full choir and good music and a
hearty service. For the next
two Sundays, then, at least,
there will be evening service and
sermon at 7:30, with a morning
service again on Sunday, March
5. All those who would like an
evening service are urged not to
put off attending, that we may
not be left in ignorance of their
preference, and so return to hav
ing exclusively the morning ser
vice. There will be a hearty
welcome for all. Sunday school
will be as usual at 10. "

THE PARENT-TEACHERS
MEETING

the Woman's Club, was that of the
Parent-Teachers meeting under the
Educational Department, held at
the Parish House, Tuesday after
noon. . Mrs. Andrew ' Miller was the
leader and the tepic for the after
noon was School Law. School law
in the abstract might not geneiaMy
be considered an all-absorbing sub
ject. However, twenty-six women
sat thruout the afternoon listening
attentively to the members of the
Club discuss the various topics
which had been assigned
The laws concerning qualifica
tions of voters at general and bond
elections, the importance of the
school census and its relation to
the moneys received by district and
county, qualifications of schools
and their almost unlimited power,
made those present realize the im
portance of each striving to become
more intelligent regarding our pub
lic institutions.
Miss Lenore Francis, County
Superintendent of Schools, was
present and contributed much
practical lnlormatjon which was
greatly appreciated by the Club.

WIT ED; HUNTER -FORSOPERVlSOR
Friends of Ed. Hunter have al
ready started a campaign to secure
his nomination at tbe democratic
primaries, as a candidate for the
office of County Supervisor from
the Williams district. From the
eupport and enthusiasm already
secured, it is apparent that Mr.
Hunter is going to be a hard man
to beat.
Among the things which fit Mr.
Hunter especially well for this po
sition are his twenty years of ex
perience as section boss for the
Santa Fe, his unparallelled success
as a farmer in this section, and his
success in business.
Mr. Hunter and his friends are
going to be heard from at the pri
maries. - -
