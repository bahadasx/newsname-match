NKW YOKK, Feb. 17. "How long do
joj think the war will last."
i it uie usual pome and more q
jibs preiunctoiy Inquiries as to the
state lit his health and what sort of a
Irln he had, judging from the writer's
personal e.prience and observations
in the last few hours, tiiis Is the first
terious question fired at every Ameri
ran revming ironi i-.urope by every
one he mots.
Anticipating some ?urh Inquisition,
mid in order to guide him in forming
an opinion, the writer had asked the
same question of a lot of folk In Eng
land just before sailing on the Baltic
for Now York. It received almost as
great a variety cf replies as the num
ber of Britishers interrogated that la
fcs to time. They ranged all the way
irom six .w eeks to six ye.irs.
Hut. in their real nenre all were
alike. "I'ntil German? Kives up!" was
the unanimous verdicf.
They're telling a pood story now in
London about the way Premier As
qttlth is said to have answered thii
ques'ion at a recent social fathering.
British cabinet members have become
fo UB"d to parrying uncomfortable or
puz?lin queries on the floor of the
house of common since the war began
that they often, unconsciously carry
their parliamentary armament into the
drawing room
"How long do yon think the war w ill
list, Mr. Asqui'.h?" inquired a fellow
tucst.
"I would have much perferred that
the honorable gentleman had given mo
previous notice of this question." re
plied the prime minister In his most
unctions on-the-carpet tone, "but since
he irslsts upon an immediate and ex
plicit reply, I will say that, the answer
is in the negative.''
Although the head of 'he British ad
ministration can't be persuaded to haz
iird a time guess on the duration of the
war, both his public and his private
utterance.-! on thb subject in recent
weeks leave no doubt that he stands
with every other Britisher whose opin
ion is at all worth considering, in the
manifestly sincere and honest belief
that the war will go on until Cfccmany
ogrees to peace on the terms of the
alii'"-.
Make no mistake about it, the allies
are out to win. They were never so
determined or so united as they are to
day. That the recent "made In Ger
many" stories of likelihood of an early
separate peace with Russia, or France,
or Knglar.d, are absolutely without
foundation I am firmly convinced.
Even in the event of the remote pos
sibility that one or more of the allies
miaht be persuaded to enter Into sep
arate peace negotiations with the cen
tral powers, England would go right on
fighting.
It would be most difficult) for any
one who has lived in the British at
mosphere rinee before the war started
and has watched the gradual altera
tion of the English national spirit from
airy cocksure ness through successive
stages of bewilderment, humiliation,
and lesson-learning, Into one or relent
less btilldcg tenacity of purpose, to ar
live at. any other conclusion.
Despite all the muddling of the past
18 months-the military miscalcula
tions, the diplomatic blunders, the po
Jitical uphoavels, the Industrial tur
moils the average Britisher has not
onlv never despaired, he has never had
iiny real doubt as to the outcome of the :
struggle. The more recent nitsioriunea
tin loss of Bulgaria, the obliteration
of Serbia and Montenegro, the failure
in Gallipot!, and the troubles in Me?o
polamla he has regarded as mere epi
sodes, unpleasant It is true, but with
out any effect ecept poscibly to retard
the final triumph of Ihe allies.

THRIFT CLUB AT
NORTH SCHOOL IS
GOING FORWARD
(By E. H. BLACK, Principal.)
Although the Thrift club of the nortn
school lias been organized only a
rhort time, a great interest is being
manifested in it both by parents and
pupils.
The children have found a great
many tilings to do in order to earn
money and are constantly on the look
out for jobs as the newsdealers aud
other business people will testify.
Monday is deposit dav and the rap
idity with which these accounts are
growing indicates that the pupils are
cure enough hustlers.
Some of the pupils began to save la it
year when Mr. Johnson's proposition
was mentioned to them by the teachers
but no club was organized at tha!
time.
The total amouut of money saved
by the pupils of this school is exact
ly $srt.36, ranging in amounts from
f 1.25 to JS8. This does not include
t-everal thousand dolalr9 belonging to
the children who receive money from
their landd
The latest plan, the fulfillment of
which is expected to add considerably
to these bank accounts, ia a sdioo!
fiarden. A tract of land has been se
cured at the corner of Chlckasha ave
tute and Ninth street, and in a few days
children will be busy clearing it off
and getting it in shape for early veget
ables. Each, pupil will have his in
dividual plot of ground upon which to
grow his garden. The money he re
ceives from his sales going to swell his
bank account.
Besides the l ig school garden, one
hundred and eighty-five pupils are
making plans for a home garden. Some
have rented vacant lots and . intend
raising vegetables for the market.
If the business men will co-operate
with the school chillren by offering
prizes and assuring them a market for
their product, every vacant lot in town
will, instead of a weed patch be a nice
garden and a great deal of energy will
be used in producing something worth

CULTIVATE
LOTS SAYS
COFFMAN
I
Mayor Gives Hearty Approval to Movement
for Gardening AH Idle Ground and
Promises . Co-operation of
City Officials
PLANS BEAUTY SPOT
NEAR CITY, HALL
Serves Notice Strong Arm of Law Will Be
Felt by Citizens Who Fafl to Keep
Down Weeds During Com
ing Summer
Mayor Coffman states that he 1 a
heartily in accord wtih the movemen:
which has been initiated by tho board
of directors of the Grady County Com
inerc'al and Farm bureau to have all
vacant lots in Chickasha cultivated.
One trouble will be met with, the
mayor states, which will be the incli
nation on the part of many of the own
ers of vacant properties to want to
charge an excessive rental on these
lots. Mr. Coffman thinks any one own
ing vacant lots may well afford to
give the use of thoso lots, rent free,
to any worthy person who will culti
vate the sarue in a careful manner, so
that the grades of the lots will not be
destroyed, and who will see to it that,
following the removal of the cropo,
weeds and taH grass will not be allow
ed to grow on the property.
"I'nfortunately," said Mr. Coffman.
"the ones who own the largest lots
will be found to be the ones who will
want an extortionate rental for th
t same. And." continued he w ith
nnile "they are the ones who will he
found the most prosperous in tho
mutter of having their weeds cut,"
The mayor, when asked what crops
he thought would be cultivated to the
best advantage in the matter of pro
ducing results to those who may cul
tivate them aud of adding to tha civic
attractiveness of the city, stated that
almost any kind of crops would answer
except corn and cane, including kafir
and feterita. He favored, however
most of all, the planting of all lots to
ordinary garden crops. "This climate,"
Mr. Coffman said, "adrr.ifH of two gar
dens a year, and two crops will go far
toward keeping the weeds and grass
down and toward keeping up the civic
appearance of the city."
Mr. Coffman stated that the city of
ficials would, he thought, agree with
him in the matter of the city's taking a
hand in the movement. He stated that
it was his idea to have the vacant lots
on the opposite side of Sixth street
from the City hall, plotted and planted
td flowers and blooming shrubs and
vines. This property does not belong
to the city, but Mr. Coffman felt sur
the owner would gladly give his! con
eent to the enterprise.
"You may tay for me," said Mr.
Coffman in closing his remarks, "the
police department will do their share
toward helping this matter along, and
as police judge I will do my share,
Acting in conjunction with Mr. Beets
commissioner of streets and alleys, 1
propose that all vacant lots shall bo
kept free of weeds during the corning
spring, summer and autumn seasons.
The owner of these lots will have thei?
choice of letting persons who will cu'
livat9 them and keep the weeds down
have their lots or cutting the weeds
which will grow in casa the lots are
not cultivated or paying fines in the
sum of $10 for each offense caused by
failure to cut the weds."
Mr. Coffman stated still further, in
conclusion, that he ftlt tha movement
on the part of the Commercial ami
Farm bttreaa would receive the heart
iest co-operation and support of a'l
citizens of the city who fcit a pride
in the civic b"auiy of Chlckasha. and
added again the assurance that tha
city, through its mayor, would be found
willing, anxious and ready to help roli
the "chariot of progress" alonsf. "And
I believe," were Mr. Cofftnan's final
words, "every city official will concu
with me and will co-operate with all
of us."
