"Mr. W. D. Vandiver challenges his
half-dozen rival for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination to make an
old-fashioned joint canvas of the
State with bim, so that the voters can
look them all over at one and take
their pick. This would save the voters'
time, which is on reason Mr. Vandiver
favors It. Further, it insures one br
well-attended meeting in each import
ant place, instead of a series of poor
ly attended individual rallies. It mul
tiplies the Inducements to the voter
to attend and simplifies the campaign
from his point of view. The old-
fashioned joint canvas was an order
ly business-like arrangement looking
to the convenience of the voter, and
especially 'it promised a dramatic in
terest and attraction that individual
rallies lack. In the old days the voter
had better information of the candi
dates and a keener sense of partici
pation in choosing them than he has
now- Nowadays most men's im
pressions of candidates are formed
second-hand or on hearsay. A revival
of the old custom would add vitally to
the primaries and conduce to more in
telligent voting." ,

COUNCIL WILL ASK BOND
. ISSUE FOR SEPTIC TANKS
A bond issue that will enable the
city to build two septic tanks to take
care of the cities refuse, will be sub
mitted to the voters in a short time.
The council ordered City Attorney
David H. Robertson to start work on
the proposition, at the council meeting
Monday night. These two tanks it is
estimated will cost the city about
$15,000. This matter has long been
discussed and something must be done
soon.
Councilman Atkinson, chairman of
the finance committee, submitted a
report that showed $3,921.18 remain
ing in the treasury. The warrents
during January amounted to $1,156.09. i
The special funds were represented
as follows: in the cemetery fund,
$351.30; in the library fund, $481; in
the sewer fund $76.62; and in the light
fund $1,300. "
Some time ago at the instigation of
the Commercial Club the council took
up the matter of passing a new ordin
ance in reference to hawkers and ven
ders. Monday night this new ordin-
lance was given its first and second
reading. The text of the ordinance
follows: ,
SECTION 1. It shall be unlawful
for any hawker or peddler whether
licensed or not, either on foot or using
any kind of vehicle or cart, to occupy
any portion of the street or sidewalk
in any block in the City for a period
of time longer than ten consecutive
minutes, nor shall such person occupy
the same block more than once, in
every two . hours, ' nor shall any such
person maintain his stand, cart or ve
hicle within fifty feet of any street
intersection, nor shall any such per
son hinder, block or obstruct traffic on
any street, alley, sidewalk or public
place anywhere in the City, and when
ever ordered to do so anywhere in the
City by any police officer, it shall be
the duty of such person to move on.
SECTION 2. Any person violating
any of the provisions of the foregoing
section shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction be
punished by a fine of not more than
One Hundred Dollars or by imprison
ment not exceeding thirty days or by
both such fine and imprisonment.
Judge Lewis, chairman of the claims
committee, reported ' bills to the
amount of $1,436.51. These the coun
cil allowed. The sexton's report for
the month showed ten burials were
made in Elmwood cemetery. Two of
these burials were negroes. The In
ternational Shoe "Factory promised
the council that a trap would be placed
in the Liberty street sewer.
A short time ago an ordinance to
amend Section III of the present or
dinance No. 25 was passed by the
council. . This ordinance is in regard
to gambling houses, games and punch
boards. Owing to some Irregularity
in the proceedure the passage of the
bill was illegal. The matter was taken
up again Monday night and the ordin
ance was given its first and second
reading, i '
Councilman Johnson and Atkinson
will report to the council the cost of
the propojed light for the dome of the
Court House. They will also confer
with the County Court again on the
matter. A street was ordered opened
up near the A. P. Green Brick Com
panies plant.
Injunction Issued.
An injunction has been issued a
gainst G. W. Robertson, of this city,
at the request of J. H. Rodcs, of St.
Louis, against the sale of the Frank
Jesse home in this city under a $2,000
deed of trust.

Aa Effort to Side Track Prohibition
Amendment in Washington Prev
' ed a Bad Failure.
CONGESSMEN TAKE POSITION
Must be For One Side or the Other
Before the November Election
. la the Result.
Washington, Feb. 16. Last night
was nightmare, night for many
gressmen. This is why:
All tha best laid plans of the "wets"
to bury to national prohibition meas
ure until after election, o that the
members wouldn't have to vote on it,
went awry. As a resultbarring
some sudden shift in the committee
every member of the House will bare
to vote "wet" or "dry" long before
next November.
Also: The committee, by a vote of
9 to 7, did vote to postpone consider
ation of the national suffrage amend
ment until December 14. The result
was last night, all the suffrage lobby
ists here are buzzing like a swarm of
angry bees. They have the telegraph
wires busy sending messages to the
home districts of the "antis" who
voted to smother a vote on the res
olution in hopes that such a storm will
be raised that the committee will re
consider its action. So the members
are getting it going and coming.
A Virglaian Changed Hi Stand.
Information that came from an ex
ecutive session of the House judiciary
committee disclosed the failure of the
attempt to wet blanket the "dry" res
olution. A motion was made to post
pone consideration of the measure
until December 14. As December 14
is long after the present session will
have closed and several weekl after
election, members from close "wet"
and "dry" districts believed the bug
aboo of a vote on the liquor question
would be avoided. But the commit
tee was a tie on the motion. 8 to 8,
thus defeating it. The "wets" had
expected the motion to carry 9 to 7.
But Representative C. C. Carlin of
Virginia, who has been for years a
leader of the "wet" forces in . his
state, unexpectedly 'flopped to the
drys" and voted against postpone
ment, i '; ,
The "wet" members of tha com
mittee' were unable to account for
Representative Carlin's change of
front, but Virginia voted "dry" in the
last election, and every saloon in the
state will be closed within the next
few months which is probably the
reason, if Mr. Carlin was closely
questioned. '
On the suffrage amendment; how
ever, Representative uarlin voted
with the "antis" to hold up consider
ation until December 14 and so the
amendment was smothered unless
"word from home" can cause' a recon
sideration.
How the Representatives Voted.
The members who voted for the de
lay were" all Democrats, four of them
being Southerners. They were: Rep
resentatives Webb of North Carolina,
Carlin of Virginia, Walker of Georgia,
Whaley of South Carolina, Caraway of
Arkansas, Igoe of Missouri, Williams
of Illinois, and Steele of Pennsylvania.
Those who voted to report the bills
were Representative Taggart of Kan
sas, Volstead of Minnesota, Nelson of
Wisconsin, Chandler of New York,
Thomas of Kentucky, Dale of New
York and Graham of Pennsylvania.
LOCAL CADETS SHOOTING.
The Missouri Military Academy is
competing in the military school
shooting matches of the National
Rifle Association this year. The plan
for the contests is that on certain
days the students shoot here while
their competitors shoot in their home
range. The two scores are then se.it
to Washington for comparison and the
results announced.
- The local cadets will start thuir
matches within a short time. The re
sults in this class for last week were
as follows:, fit John's Delafield, Wis,
led with 983. Other scores were:
New Mexico, 970; Bordentown, 965;
Miami, O., 949; Wentworth, 948; St.
John's, New York, 930; Tennessee,
919; Kemper, 900; and Harvard, Los
Angeles, 894.
KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS MEET.
Fifty members or more of the
Knights of Columbus attended the
meeting at the Odd Fellows Hall Sun
day afternoon. Three , out-of-town
speakers addressed the assembly. They
were: Wm, Smart, of Moberly; Grand
Knight of the Moberly Council
Freeland; and Mr. Newman, of St
Louis. Plans tS increase the mem
bership of the order were formulated
and will be put under way at once.
On March the fifth the Mexico lodge
and the Moberly council will hold a
joint meeting in Moberly at which
time the new members of each lodge
will be initiated. The Mexico council
of the Knights of Columbus is one of
the strongest councils in the state.
WOULD DRILL ALL STUDENTS.
'Washington, Feb. 15. In a recent
public address here Vice-President
Thomas R. Marshall advocated mili
tary training of students in the
schools and colleges of the country.
"I want some sort of education in the
educational institutions of the land
whereby our young -men may be
taught three things how to take
care of their health, how to take or
ders and how to fire a gun," the Vice-
President said, .
THIRTY-FIVE DIVORCE
SUITS HERE IN 1915
What are the causes of divorces?
There are 176,156 divorced merNn
the United States and 195,201 divor
ced women.
In Audrain County during 1915
there were thirty-five divorce suits
filed in the Circuit Court of which
twenty-five were filed by women.
Circuit Clerk Eppa F. Elliott says
the principal charge mad in the
divorce petitions filed by women are
desertion and non-support Those
filed by the men usually charge un
faithfulness. In the former case
unfaithfullness may be behind the
cause but if a woman can prove de
sertion sh can secure a divorce
without bringing any undersirable
features into the case which might
not only embarass her but her chil
dren.
Mexico ministers, as are those
throughout the country, are becom
ing more and more strict regarding
marrying divorced people. As a rule
they ask those who come to them to
be married if they have been divor
ced? If so they inquire the cause
anl if they do sot consider it sufficient
reason refuse to perform the cere
mony. Circuit Judge J. D. Barnett, of the
Audrain Court, if he finds a perron
seeks divorce purely for the purpose
of marrying another refuse to grant
the petition. In some cases where
such a plan is suspected but cannot
be proved he sets a time limit before
they can marry by extending the per
iod before the full separation is
granted. ' '
, Some Divorce Causes.
Judge Chas. A. McDonald, of Chi
cago, who had 2,092 divorce eases
filed in his court the first six months
of 1915 says of the cause and cure for
divorce: " , "
"We have erotic literature motion
picture shows based on false notions
of what society is doing and of the
sorts of lives men and women live
who have unlimited capital at their
disposal. We see halls of fashion
and revels of the dance banquets
and wine floods and all sorts of spec
tacular oddities engaged in by those
who have made money in a hurry and
are hanging on the fringe of decent
society in the United States.
'We have loose moral training in
the home. There is a disposition to
relegate to the public school all train
ing of the child. The religious and
moral culture of the child still remain
in this country matter of home work.
This may have to be changed. -
Facing Facts A Cure.
"Summing up, I should say 4hat
the principal cause of divorce is the
false ideal.' Men and women grow up
with picture book and Sunday supple
ment ideas of life.
"These cannot survive. Life is ser
ious at its best a struggle. Only the
stronger minded survive the pitfalls.
The weaker we Have to deal with in
the divorce courts day after day,
week after week, month after month.
It is a condition that calls for its
remedy.
"What is the remedy!
"Fact. When a man is confronted
with a certain set of facts in the way
of salary, expense, debt and, perhaps
fixed earning limitation, he knows
without much introspection just where
he gets off. If he trusts to luck he
will get into the divorce court or some
other disagreeable place. It behooves
him to face the truth the facts.
"What we need in aid of better
conditions so far as divorce is con
cerned is more truth less artificial
ity. If. we can get wives and hus
bands to tell each other the frank
truth about things there will be fewer
wives and husbands in the divorce
courts." '
MRS. FERRIS WINNER.
The Better Housekeeping Club, of
the St Louis Republic, awarded one
of its prizes this week to Mrs. L. Roy
Ferris, of this city. The purpose of
the club is to solve housekeeping prob
lems. Mrs. Ferris reply was to a
query regarding economy and was as
follows:
The Better Housekeeping Club.
In a family where home sewing -is
'done for little children the
greatest economy in time, as well
as money, is to select a becoming
dress pattern for the little girl
and model all her season's dresses
by it, differentiating them by the
trimmings and material. By do
ing this we know exactly how
much cloth to buy, after the first
dress, therefore eliminating
waste.
A touch of handwork on the
collar, cuffs or belt of these little
dresses gives distinction and
saves the expense of buying trim
mings. MRS. L. ROY FERRIS.

LEPERS HI!" WILD 111
THE U. S. THEY SAY
Five Hundred Persona at Large Who
Suffer With Terrible Disease
Say the Experts.
SENATE COM. HEARS REPORT
Spread ef the Disease in This Country
is a Growing Menace and Should
Be Checked.
Washington, Feb. 16. More than
five hundred lepers at large in the
United States constitute a menace of
serious possibilities unless proper
steps for segregation are taken, in the
opinion of physicians, nurses and oth
ers who testified before the Senate
health committee today in support of
a bill to establish a national leprosar
ium. .
The witnesses, all of whom had
made extensive personal researches on
the subject agreed that the three bun
dred persons under treatment in the
country's, three state or municipal
leper asylums included less than one
third of the total of those afflicted.
They declared that the disease was
rapidly spreading, that the danger of
a serious epidemic was real and that
segregation was the first demand In
tha campaign against it
It was the consensu of opinion a
mong those who testified that about
fifty lepers were at large in New York
City, eighty in Chicago and at least
one or two in each of the large cities
throughout the country. They de
clared, in arguing for a national asy
lum, that individual victims were
treated in many instances with great
inhumanity by local authorities inter
ested chiefly in shifting the burdens
of care to some other community.
GERMANS INVENT HAND;
IT IS ALMOST HUMAN
Berlin (via London), Feb. 11. At
the convention of the German Orth
opedic Society, which is now in session
here, many invention of method for
repairing the wastes of war have
been exhibited or discussed. :
Dr. Ferdinand Sauerbruch, profes
sor of surgery at Zurich University,
showed the delegates an artificial
hand which was able to grasp objects
of all forms and to lift weights up to
two hundred pounds. An entirely
novel feature of the hand is that it
and the fingers are controlled . by
muscular action in the upper arm,
which is prepared for such work by
two operations. The muscular power
afterwards is transmitted to the hand
through a system of wires and pul
leys to which all the fingers respond.
Dr. Karl Ludloff, professor of sur
gery at Breslau University, described
a method for uniting severed nerves
and reviving the muscular action of
nerveless limbs. Doctor . Ludloff
pointed out hat the natural tendency
of severed ends of nerves to reunite
is hindered by the fact that the cic
atrized new flesh between them is
impervious to growing nerve fiber.
Professor Ludloff said he restore
the connection by a piece of an artery
of an ox filled with gelatin, through
which nerves readily growj van
bridging gaps of several inches. Af
ter Beveral weeks crippled limbs re
gain their motor activity. The pro
fessor said that many case already
had been successfully treated'where
permanent lameness would otherwise
have followed. .
THE A. P. Green Brick Company
is making some substantial improve
ments at the local plant, erecting sev
eral new kilns and employing more
labor than ever before. On account
of the scarcity of home labor, Mr.
Green last week had to employ
eighteen laborers from another town.
We hear the complaints from time to
time about people not being able to
get employment On looking into the
matter you will probably find that
everybody in Mexico that wants to
work can find something to do before
night.

city. Father Casey spent two years
in the Philippine Islands as chaplain
of the First United States infantry,
George Washington's regiment.and is
very familiar with conditions there.
"I returned from the Philippines in
1908," stated Father Casey," and had
visited all of them except Mindanao.
Being in touch with the eclesiastical
authorities as well as the army I was
in position to know general conditions
there unusually well'.
. "The educated Philippines is an ex
ceptionally bright man and as most
of the inhabitants of the Island are
more or less ignorant there could be
but one outcome of giving them free
dom from the United States the edu
cated, many of who are shrewed pol
iticians, would assume charge and
democracy would shortly be a farce.
The conditions there are unlike those
in old Mexico. .'
"I believe the government will
change its mind about freeing these
islands before the time comes to do so.
It would be a great mistake. The
politicians among the Philippines are
only waiting for such an opportunity
to establish themselves and thwart the
purpose of such fredom."

LA PLATA BEATEN BY
McMillan es tq 21
(By Fred Lavender.)
The McMillan Crimson and gray
basketeers continues to take double
hitches on the basketball champion
ship of the interscholastic league every
week. Saturday night they defeated
La Plata High School, champions of
North Missouri by a score of 68 to 21.
It is beginning to look like the gods
of destiny are with the McMillan bas
ketball team. Even when the captain
and one or two star men are not able
to play, the team continues to win
just the same. This was the case
Saturday night when the La Plata
five was met This school holds the
championship for north Missouri, but
the crimson and gray boys more than
trebled the score on them, the final
being 68 to 21.
Cunningham, the star elonga-e!
center, and Keath, the fighting for
ward, were not able to play at all, and
Rodes had to retire in the middle of
the last half. But this made no dif
ference other than to cause a fpw
long faces before the game started.
Sam Locke distinguished himself aa
wnter ,and Loyal Wonneman, Or-
ville Austin, and Harper Ehoush ably
filled the vacancies in the forward
field. Joy Kistler ,the fast running
guard, played his usual great game
at right guard and shot e'.evn
goals, v Morris Keath loaned hii
"fight" to Locke and he used it in
great style throughout the game.
Coach Rich is a strong advocate of
team work, and he certainly has de
veloped his squad along this line. In
every game of the year his team has
far surpassed their opponents in team
work.
McMillan has played nine games
this year, and won all of them, many
by a 'large majority. Her team has
scored 374 points while her opponents
have only scored 166 points. The
team has three more games to play-
Hannibal, there, Feb. 12; Ferguson,
here, Feb. 24. and Jefferson City,
there, Feb. 25.
