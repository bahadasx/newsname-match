A Large Turnout of Yale Citizens
and Farmers at the Meeting
Tuesday Afiernoon
. Much enthusiasm was manifest at
the Lie railroad meeting held in Cen
tral hall, Tuesday afternoon, in, the
neighborhood of four hundred men' and
women from Yale and the farming
community around here were present.
J. K. lleavis occupied the chair and
spoke at some length on the advantages
to be derived by being connected with
Detroit by an electric line through Ue
Thumb of Michigan, and why every
citizen of Yale and surrounding coun
try should get busy and grasp this op
portunity to become in touch with the
great metropolis of the 6tate.
Neil Grant, representing the Detroit
Hoard of Commerce, was introduced by
the chairman. In his talk he stated
that the organization which 6ent him
out were anxious to get in touch with
every section of the state by electric or
steam roads and are doing their utmost
to help the good work along.
John H. Allerdyce, promoter of the
new electric railroad lrom Detroit to
Eraser, Armada, Memphis, Emmett,
Old Brock way, Yale and on north to
Harbor Beach, was called upon and in
his lair, honest, straightforward way
told the people what the company pro
posed to do and also what they expected
in return. He informed his hearers
that sixteen miles of roadbed had been
graded from Eraser to Armada, the
survey to Yale was staked out, Mem
phis and Emmett were busy securing
the required bonus and rights of way,
and that if Yale raised $25,000 bonus
and secured the rights of way asked, he
would be sate in saying that cars wouM
be running into Yale next fall.
Harry J. Weber made the crowniug
speech of this successful meeting. To
say that he is an orator in the right
sense of the word would be stating it
none too strongly. He represented a
big enterprising man in a large and
rapidly growing city, a city that is ex
pected will reach the million mark in
population within a few years. Mayor
Marx is the big man we refer to and
Detroit is the city which has progressed
rapidly during the past ten years and
at the present time is increasing in
population at the rate of two hundred
lifty families a week. Mr. Weber put
a great deal of stress upon the possi
bilities and probabilities now in sight
and with lorethought the men who
hold the reins of government in that
city are looking ahead and preparing
to feed the multitude of people who
aie steadily coming in. He said that
the Mayor, whose spokesman he was,
urged him to place extra 6tress on the
matter of helping Detroit by securing
the Detroit, Armada & Northern R'y,
and the city in return would heip
every section along the route.
Committies will be selected this week
and the work of soliciting the bonus
and rights of way will be started next
week. Let no one turn down this
proposition, lour mite may be the
bringing of the electric railroad. All
get busy.

Work of County Agriculturist
The time last week was devoted
largely to institute work. On Monday,
the Round-up in Sanilac county was
attended at Croswell where the breed
ing of live stock was discussed. Tbi
meeting was well attended considering
the weather, and splendid interest was
shown by those present. Tuesday and
Wednesday were occupied with the St.
Clair County Institute at Port Huron.
While the attendance was not all that
could be desired, the state speakers
were well pleased with the attitude of
those present, and stated that they bad
never talked to a more appreciative
audience.
Friday a talk was given on "Feeding
the Dairy Herd" at the Round-up In
stitute at Saginaw. This was really
the largest and one of the best meet
ings it has ever been my privilege to
attend.
Thursday was spent at the meeting
of the Union Farmer's Club at the
home of J. O. Cook in Mussey town
ship. There were about lifty people
present and a yery interesting and help
ful meeting was held. Assistance was
given with the question box and other
matters pertaining to the work of the
Farmers Federation were discussed.
An important matter that should be
kept in mind by all interested in the
agricultural welfare of the county is
the annual meeting of the St. Clair
County Farmers' Federation In the
Court Room of the Federal Building
Wednesday, February 23. livery agri
cultural organization is entitled to be
represented at this meeting by three
delegates. These include all such or
ganizations as the Granges, Farmers'
Clubs, Gleaner Arbors, etc., and it is
hoped that the greater portion of the
organizations of the county will be
represented. These delegates will be
the voting members, but everyone who
is interested in the movement is invit
ed to be present. Dr. Eben Mumford,
State Leader of County Agents, and
possibly Prof. R. J. Baldwin of the
Michigan Agricultural College will be
present and address the meeting.
