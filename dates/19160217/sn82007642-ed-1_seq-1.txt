strongest of the men President
Wilson had gathered around
himself as counsellors and advi-
8ors. And as a cabinet officer he
has made a BDlendid record. -

What Colonel Chapman does be-

The State laws' relative to block
ading have become slightly more
rigorous and with this has come
more general public demand
that illicit distilling he looked af

gan of "Let Uncle Sam do it" is
