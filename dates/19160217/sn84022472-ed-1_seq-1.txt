walls fell outward intact.
.Absolute denial was made this
morning by all officials of the Farist
Steel Co. that they were manufactur
ing or had in the past manufactured
either directly or Indirectly any ma
terial for, war purposes. They wer
at a loss to conceive the cause of the
fire, as their watchman has reported
that lie passed through the building
In which J.t originated just three min
utes "before he noticed that the whole
structure ' was ablaze.
- Chief Johnson said today:
."Among the peculiarities, of this fire
is that it. apparenUy blazed the most

watchman persists that it started first
in the tool room which was in am
other section of the plant. We must
' take his word for this." . V
J "Officials and others in the Farist
Steel Works declare that no heat or
combustible material was anywhere
near the suspected spot of origin for
many days. -v

Chief Johnson said today:
v "The trouible came through the fail
ure of an auxiliary box to work. When
' pur men came to the fire upon the
call of an outsider, we wanted to send
In a second alarm. The night wateh-
' man told us that he had just rung
In an alarm from the factory. We
.then saw no necessity of ringing in
. another. In a. few minutes, however,
when apparatus did not respond we
: took- the matter -in our own hands
and sent in a second alarm from' a
. street box and also called other com
panies by telephone."
- The fire was discovered at 10:40 -by
Watchman John FarreU, living at 373
Catherine street, as he was going his
- rounds of the rolling mills. He has
been employed in that capacity for the
last 35 years. Aft FarreU entered
the mill opposite the office of the com-
- pany he found the interfor .i of. the
wooden building a mass of flames. He
ran to the private alarm box (of the
company and opening the door of the
box he pulled down the lever.
FarreU ran to the gate of the fac
tory yards and au piously awaited the
arrival of the fire apparatus for fully
10 minutes, 'he said. He then ran
back to the private alarm box and to
his astonishment he found that the
wires had been broken from the
weight of heavy timbers falling inside
the first rolling mill.
". FarreU says he then ran to the
gate on East Main street and here
b struck a snag. He was unable to
'" open the -large swinging gate and by
. this time Victor Pace, watchman at
the plant for the last 16 years, came
to his assistance. They had a diffi
cult time of it opening the big swing
ing gate and all ' this time the big
fire was raging in rolling mill No. 1. It
had now extended to rolling mills 2
and 3. 'A. man named Crowley, work
ing on one of the nearby" oyster boats,
was passing at the time. - He saw the
two watchmen frantically endeavoring
to open the .big gate and realizing
there was something wrdng and that
no alarm had been rung in from the
private box, Crowley ran to East
Main street and Stratford avenue,
where he turned in an alarm from
box 631.
On the first alarm Engine compan
ies 2 and 5, Chemical No. 1 and Truck
Co. No. 2 responded. On the second
alarm Engine Companies 8 and 4 re
sponded. Chief Daniel E. Johnson,
upon his arrival, saw at a glance that
it was necessary to turn in a second
alarm and he did so at box 631.

BRANDEIS FOES
SAY HE AIDED IN
NEW HAVEN GRAB
Boston Lawyer Declares He
Appeared For Dummy in f
N. E. Road Suits.
Washington,' Feb. , 17 Moorefleld
. Storrey, Boston attorney charged be
fore the investigating sub-committee
of the , Senate today that Bran dels
helped to wreck the New York & New
England Railroad, in 1892 and 1893,
with the result that it ' was- absorbed
by the New Haven road. ..'
.Asked as to Mr. Brandeis reputa
tion as a lawyer, Mr. Storrey testified:
.."I think his reputation in the Bos
ton '.bar is that he ..is a vefy capable,
very energetic and if necessary to ad
vance his objects, he is not scrupulous
as - to his methods, nor-is he to be
trusted." . ' ' '
.' Mr. Storey had been summoned by
the committee in its inquiry into the
fitness -of Mr. Brandeis for the su
preme court. Senator Walsh told the
witness that C. W. Barron, of Boston,
had said' Rrandeisvwas once employed
to help wreck the. New England Rail
road. "I think that is true," said Mr.
Storey. He proceeded to describe
the New England as a competitor of
the New Haven between Boston and
few York. i
"ShorOy before the spring of 1892,"
he said, "the New Haven began to 'ha
rass the New England, which ran part
way to New York over the New Haven
tracks.
' "In the Sprang of 1892 Mr. Brandeis
brought a series of 10 suits against the
New England railroad in MassacISti
setls, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
He was acting ostensibly for N. F.
Goldsrmitha vBoeton liquor dealer, and
small New England stockholders and.
some . Societies. The bills were de
signed to paralyze the financial oper
ations of the New England road. '
'In the following year the Massa
chusetts legislature investigated rela
tions of the New Haven and New
England roads. I conducted, the hear
ing. Mr. Brandeis testified there that
he was counsel in all these suits which
impaired "the finances of the-. New Eng
land road, forcing it into receivers'
hands -in 1893, from which it emerged
as the property of the New Haven.
"The suits; while brought in the
name of Goldsmith, - were really
brought in some other interests."
Sherman L. Whipple, another Bos'
ton attorney concerned in the Warren
will case, .in. (response to questions by
George W. Anderson, representing Mr.
B-a.Tide1s, vmade this statement:
"As a lawyer Mir. Birandeis is able
and learned. As a man he is consci
entious and high-minded. The fea
ture of his career, which is the most
striking and remarkable, has been his
unselfish and unswerving devotion to
the social, moral and Industrial uplift
of the lowly and less fortunate of our
people. I believe that on -the supreme
court bench of the United States he
will inherd't a strong influence in es
tablishing the ideals, to which he has
been devoted in his recent years."

Drop forgers and die sinkersxwho
went on strike yesterday at the pant
of the Remington Arms & Ammuni
tion Co. announced this morning that
no overtures will be made to the com
pany; that the' men wll wait three
weeks, and then, unless their griev
ances are adjusted, all will leave the
city for other jobs, which they say
are waiting for them,
'; Members of the Drop Forgers' union
began preparations today for pre
fering charges against a policeman in
the employ of the city of Bridgeport.
It is asserted he used unlawful force
and insulting language in 'assisting to
discharge a Remington employe.
A meeting of the strikers was held
this morning at 119 Wall street, Bar
tenders' union hall. A statement given
out there said, that all the men 'in the
drop forging room of the Remington
plant are out, that all the die sinkers
have quit and . that the bayonet
straighteners were locked out of the
plant for more thafri an hour today.
It was estimated 250 have auit. On
the other hand an official statement
rom fie company, say that half the
men in the department involved, are
out.
Corri plaint is made against the
guards of the Remington shop, against
a policeman, -against Superintendent
Ellingham and others.
The grievances of the men concern
working conditions and spoiled work.
They protest that they have to pay
for bayonets that are spoiled. They
say they are willing to pay for them,
provided they " may then become the
owners. They said this morning that
the resent losing their , piece work
wage on spoiled work, and then buy
ing the "material, and not receiving it.
A Suggestion was made to Superin
tendent Ellingham, they say, that they
Be allowed to cart the material away
after buying it, but this was refused.
they say. - . . . : : - .
"We have to throw those bayonets
in the scrap," the company officials
said today in a statement. "The ma
terial costs money and we can't afford
to have the men spoil such great
quantities." ' ;
The company's position on this mat
ter, as stated today. is: "These men
aire able to earn from $14 .to $16 a
day, and in the desire to increase their
earnings, they work hurriedly. We
cannot accept carelessly treated bayo
nets, because the inspectors reject
them. Then they go into the scrap.
"Several wekes ago we called a halt.
We told the men that this couldn't go
on- so great quantities were being
spoiled. We told them we'd be will
ing to wipe the slate clean, but from
then on they would have to pay for
the work they spoiled. Later we said
we'd divide the loss, they, to pay half
for the material and the company the
other half. They objecfed, andj want
ed to go on turning out defective bay
onets and having trie-company pay for
the material spoiled.
. "On the wage matter, we guaran
teed them a day and .a quarter pay.
Thus, if things were slack, and they
had reached the minimum figure they
could go home. The claim that the
men rnake that they work sometimes
ali day for nothing is untrue. ' . -
"Regarding the assertion that the
company is advertising 7 0" cents an
hour, and' then,not paying it this is
misleading. We advertise that' we'll
pay as high as 70 cents an hour. There
are die sinkers and die sinkers, just as
there are painters and painters. An
artist and fence painter vary in skill.

New Orleans, La., Feb. 17 -Flood
waters from the crevasse in the Mis
sissippi river at Buck Ridge early to
day are near the town of St. Joseph.
The water is taking a ' southward
course after having filled Lake Bruin,
seven miles below Newellton.
.... Hundreds of recruits have joined
the rescuing parties and organized ef
forts are being made to take the ma
rooned persons to places of safety.
Scarcity of boats makes this work dif
ficult. The food situation is expect
ed to present a problem at Newellton.
There are several thousand negro
refugees housed in mills and cotton
gins around that town and few if any
brought more than enough food to
last through a day.
During the night the refugee camps
at Natchez and Vidalia gained new
members. The food situation at
Natchez, owing to arrival yesterday of
a steamer loaded with supplies, was
regarded today as satisfactory for the
present at least.
' Early morning reports showed that
600 workers at New Roads, below the
mouth of the Red river, were holding
their . own against the river's attack
on the levee there. While it is stated
there is still danger of a break, the
chances for the levees holding are
much brighter than last night.
So far three unidentified negroes
are the only victims of the high water.

A collision in which the sinking of

Sixth District Republican
Club Defection Takes
Form In New Club
A forerunner of a (movement similar
to the Young Man's movement some
years ago and , which seems likely to
disrupt the Republican party here is
evidenced in the fact that in tne sixth
district already an effort -is being
made to organize another Republican
club there. . Lewis C. Miller of 2,925
North Main street and Deputy Jailer
Patrick O'Brien, cure said to be back of
the movement.
The row in this district dates from
last fall when Alfred Knapp was
elected president of the club, defeat
ing Mr. O'Brien. Just previously the
faction now in control of the club had.
insisted on the resignation of Charles
Kingston as member of ' the Republi
can town committee. Mr. ' Kingston,
quit without a fight.
Some forty Republican voters of the
district who claim that most of the
members of the present district club
have been (registered on the Demo-'
cratic primary list for years and who
also claim that these men- are taking
advantage of their membership in the
club to seek jobs from the Republican
administration, have (decided to form
the new club. - '
Men who profess to be familiar with
Republican politics are saying that
the insurruction will spread all , over
