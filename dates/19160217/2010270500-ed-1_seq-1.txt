MENTS IN ACCORD.
ELIMINATE WORD "ASSUMES"
Preceding Mention of Liability for In
Jury to Neutrals, Berlin Consents to
Suggestion that Word "Recognizes"
Be Submitted.
Western Ntxtsaptr Union Mw Settler.
Washington, D. C Germany has
agreed to the suggestion of the United
States that Bhe substitute the words
"recognizes liability" for the words
"assumes liability" in the tentative
tett of the communication designed
to'settle the Lubltanla case. The re
vised draft has been received from
Berlin and submitted to Secretary
Lansing by Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador.
Several other changes desired by
tho United States and described as
being of minor Importance have been
made. In one instance Germany Is
understood to have proposed a chango
in the language suggested by the
American government.
$From high Teutonic authority came
ine statement that it was expected the
Lusitania case would be finally settled
to the satisfaction of the United
States and Germany.
American officials say the two gov
ernments were "substantially in ac
cord." Teutonic olflcials seem most confi
dent that In agreeing to tho American
request to the word "recognize" for
the word "assumes," preceding the
mention of liability of Germany to
make reparation for injury to neutrals,
the Berlin foreign office had removed
a cause of possible difficulty.
ABSENCE OF POMP.
Quiet Opening of Britain's New Par
liament No Royal Display.
London. There was little that was
spectacular or sensational about tho
opening day of tho new session of tho
British parliament. The parliament
started on its business with a sober air
befitting the serious.busincss which it
is to accomplish in tho next few weeks.
The prime minister, Mr. Asquitb, in
t'gUhouse of commons, and tho sec
rcvarj for war, Karl Kitchener, in tho
house of lords, reviewed the present
status of the nation's affairs. Mr. As
qulth appealed for national economy;
Earl kitchener closed with an expres
sion of the hope that the now system
of army enlistments would yield tho
required number of men to carry tho
war to a decisive conclusion.
But for the presence of a number
of ladies listening to the king's speech,
tho upper chamber would have had a
bare aspect, as there wore not twenty
peers present when the five commis
sions whoso duty it was to open par
liament in the absence of King George
took their places on the woolsack.
No Abatement In Hunt.
Chicago. There is no abatement in
tho police search for persons who
were suspected of having a share in
what was termed a nation wide ant
archistic conspiracy against establish
ed society which came to light with
the discovery that, guests at the ban
quet horo last week in honor of Arch
bishop Mundeleln were the victims of
a plot to poison them.

Chicago. Dave Lowisohn, Chicago
representative of tho promoters of tho
Wlllard-Moran boxing match, has stat

set.

CLIFFORD THORNE OF IOWA
MAKES GRAVE CHARGES.
Declares President's Candidate for
Supremo Court Justlco Guilty
of Infidelity.
Washington, Feb. 11. Grave charges
against Louis D. Brandels, nominated
by President Wilson ns Siiprarao court
Justlco, woro mado on Wednesday in
a publlo hearing before a subcommit
tee. Clifford Thorne, chairman of tho
Iowa railroad commission, caused a
sonsatlon when ho dellboratoly told
tho committee that he belloved tho
president's candidate guilty of:
1. Infldolity, breach of faith and
unprofessional conduct in connection
with ono of tho greatest cases of this
generation.
2. Committing himself as counsol
for tho Interstate commerco commis
sion to tho proposition that a roturn
of 7 per cent on railroad capital Is
not adequato, although tho commis
sion itself had fixed that rato as an
adequate profit.
Tho charges, dolivored in n calm,
dollborato tone, took away tho breath
of tho solemn senato subcommlttco
and mado tho crowd In tho committee
room gasp. Ho reviewed In detail the
conduct of himself and Mr. Brandels
in tho railroad rato caso of 1010 and
1013 beforo tho Intorstato commerco
commission. Ho sought to show that
Mr. Brandois, after acting for tho ship
pers in 1910, had bocomo attorney for
tho commission In 1913 and had not
acted in good faith. Tho object of his
testimony was to show that tho con
duct of Brandois was unbecoming a
lawyer of "Judicial tomperamont," and
that on railroad quostlons tho Su
premo court eandldato was already
committed and would not bo ablo to
net Judicially if such quostlons came

tion by tho central powors of their pur
poso after March 1 noxt to rogard
armed merchant ships ns warships
and sink them on sight 1b in oxact ac
cordance with tho now policy of tho
United States ns laid down by tho
American note of Jauunry 18.
It is expected President Wilson now
will givo instructions to all port of
ficials directing thorn to consider
armed merchantmen ns auxiliary
cruisers nnd to apply to them the
rules under which such vessols must
depart within twenty-four hours after,
arrival oryiftor necessary repairs nro
mado or stores taken on board.
It Is expected further that warnings
will bo issuod directing Americans not
to travel on belligerent armed mer
chant ships.
Tho note, by direction of tho secre
tary of stato to American ambassadors,
was addieshcd to tho Europoan bel
ligerents in connection with tho recog
nition of submarines ns commerco do
stroycrs and tho desirability of tho dis
armament of belligerent merchantmen.
Its tot in part is as follows:
"It Is a matter of tho deepest in
terest to my government to bring to
an end, if possible, tho dangers of llfo
which attend tho uso of submarines as
at present employed In destroying
"uoniy commerco on tho high Bcas,
dinco on any merchant vessel of bel
ligerent nationality thoro may bo citi
zens of tho United Stntes who havo
taken passago or members of tho crow
in tho exercise of their recognized
rights as noutrals.
"Whilo I am fully nllvo to tho ap
palling lofls of llfo among noncombat
ants, regardless of ago or sex, which
has resulted from tho present method
of destroying merchant vessels with
out removing tho persons on Hoard to
places of Dr.rotyandwhllol view that
practlco as contrary to thoso humano
principles which should control bel
ligerents In tho conduct of their naval
operations, I do not fool that n bol
llgerent should bo deprived of tho
piopor uso of submarines in tho in
vasion of commorce, since those in
struments of war havo proved tholr
effectiveness in this prnctlcal branch
of warfare on tho high sens.
"Your government will understand
that In seoklng a formula or nilo I ap
proach It of necessity from tho' point
of viow of a neutral, but I bellovo that
It will bo equally efficacious In pro
serving tho lives of noncombatants on
morchant vessols of belligerent nation
alities. "My comments on this subject aro
predicated on tho following proposi
tions: "1. A noncombatant has a right to
traverse tho high soas in ns merchant
vessel entitled to fly n belligerent flag,
to roly upon tho observnnco of tho
rules of international law and princi
ples of humanity, and if tho vessol is
approached by a naval vessel of an
other bolllgoront tho morchant vcbsoI
of enemy nationality should not bo at
tacked without being ordered to stop.
"2. An enemy morchant vessol when
ordorcd to do so by a belligerent sub
marlno should immediately stop.
"3. Such vcsboI should not bo at
tacked after being ordered to Btop un
less it attempts to floo or resist. la
case it ceases to floo or resist, tho at
tack should bo discontinued.
"4. In tho event that it is impossible
to plnco a prlzo crow on board of an
onomy merchant vessol, or to convoy
it into port, tho vessel may bo sunk,
provided tho crow nnd passengers
havo been removed to a plnco of safe
ty "It would thereforo appear to ho
rcasonablo and reciprocally Just ar
rangement If it could bo agreed by tho
opposing belligerents that submarines
should bo caused to ndhoro strictly to
tho rules of international law in tho
matter of stopping and searching mor
chant vcbboIs, determining thoir bol
llgerent nationality and removing tho
crows and passengers to places of
Bafety beforo sinking tho vessels as
prizes of war, and that merchant ves
sols of bolligorcnt nationality should
bo prohibited from carrying any arma
ment whataoovor.
"I should add that my government
Is impressed with tho reasonableness
of tho nrguracnt that a merchant ves
sel carrying an armament of any sort
should bo held to bo an auxiliary cruis
er nnd so treated by a neutral as woll
as by a bolllgoront'fKOvernmont and is
Beiiously considering instructing its
officials accordingly."

HIS VISION OF FUTURE CITY
French Architect Sees Great Changes
to Bo Brought About In the
Years to Come.
At a recent Bothering of -world-renowned
architects Edouard Henard,
architect for tho city of Paris, pro
sontcd a pnpor which included a num
ber of novel BuggcBtions ob to tho re
quirements In tho city plan of tho fu
ture. Ho predicted that public sorvico
within tho noxt quarter of a century
will include many details not yet oven
undor consideration. Most of theso
aro to bo suppllod by tubo and pro
vision for a perfect network of Borv
lco tubos must bo mado in city plan
ning. Thoy would sorlously interfero
with present nrrangoraents.
Vacuum cleaning may bo ono of
theso nnd it will rcqulro a plpo from
oYory houso for tho pnoumatlc dust
removal which will bo regarded as an
cssontlnl part ot public health work.
As tho uses of cold air incroaso, oth
er tubos will supply It to lowor tho
tomporaturo as desired and for tho
distribution of fresh air from tho sea
or tho mountains. Mr. Henard empha
sized tho feasibility ot this fresh air
supply ns n health measure, becauso
of tho fact that a meter of fresh air
from a nearby street contained 6,000
dlBcaso germs, whllo the samo amount
from tho mountains or tho sea neod
contain almost nono. As coal oil la
largely used for fuel, purposes in Paris
and is productlvq of less smako and
dust than othor fuels, ho suggests tho
possibility of an oil plpo sorvico for
all residences similar to tho gas pipes
now in uso.
Tho old Idea that the street should
bo lovel with tho ground may in fu
ture bo considorcd erroneous. It
should bo sufficiently ubovo tho sur
faco it 1b hold, to give room for all
thoso sorvico utilities between it and
tho ground. Tho adjacent houses
should havo basement floors. "Tho

Haphazard.
As to tho planting of street trees
It is woll beforo coming- to any dofinito
decision to study tho special situation
carefully and to consult a reliable nur
Boryman and then plant with a fixed
determination to givo each tree ovory

best standard street trees: Ttock and
Norway Maplos, tho foliage turning
a rich gold and crimson in tho au
turn; American Ash, which has beau
tiful compound follago, dark grcon
abovo and lighter boncath, and turns
from' green to yellow and thon to a
purplish tint In tho autumn; English
Elm, which is very ornamontal and re
tains its leaves longer than any other
variety in' tho autumn, hut which
should bo protected by spraying from
tho gypsy moth nnd olm booties;
American Llndon, which flowers iu

tho falling petals do not littor tho
ground; Ginkgo, a Japaneso treo, grow
ing to a height ot some forty to sixty
foot and robust enough to enduro gen

ental Piano, tho latter a rapid growor
and singularly free from insects. Tho
Bluo Gum treo may bo also added to
tho list in southern climates.
