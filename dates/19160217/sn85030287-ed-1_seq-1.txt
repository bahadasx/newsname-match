Lost In Fog
Clay Sbane, who lives with his
parents on their farm, sixteen
miles south-east of Meade, left
home last Thursday morning be
tween nine and ten o'clock to
look'after traps, which be had set
not far from the house. There
was a heavy fog that morning-,
and when he did not return with
in a. reasonable length of time
the family became alarmed and
started in search. Failing to lo
cate him they notified neighbors
and searching parties were at
once formed. The remainder of
that day, all night, and until

him before he was finally found
near Rice Bros, ranch, thirteen
miles west of Ashland, He had
not slept and had nothing to eat
for two days. When overtaken
he was headed toward some
' rough country, used only for
pasture, and had he gone much
further, it is doubtful if he would
have been found before death,

Shepherd, followed and was with
him when found.
Odd Fellows
The Meade Initiatory Degree
team went to Fovvler Thursday
and put on that degree to a good
class of candidates, after which
a nice lunch was served and all
reported a royal good time.
On Monday the First Degree
team of Fowler came down and
put on the First Degree and they
certainly knew how to do the
work. We would be pleased to
see this team go to Grand Lodge
and give the work there. If they
t , did we are confident that they
would carry off the first prize.
1 After lodere closed a big feed

(' rejoiced that they were present.
Ma more such meetings occur.

I Mr. R. T. Worman, who owns a farm near Meade, is to be
congratulated upon the recent purchase of a Mogul 8-10 tractor
,l from the well-known Meade implement dealer, Mr. J. T. Helm.
" Mr. Worman thus joins the ranks of the farmers who arc ub
instituting cheap kerosene power for the much more expensive
j, 'horse power on the farm.
Mr. Worman expects to use bis Mogul 8-16 for all the heavy
work his horses have been doing, keeping horses only for the
corn planting, cultivating, and other light jobs.
Besides its' economy, the tractor bas two other advantages
v it can d all kinds of belt work that the borse cannot do, and it
, moves itself from one job to another.

due to the recent freeze. At
times the big cars were able to
run a mile a minute, along other
stretches they had to go into low.

in bad shape.

worst occurring to Billy Orr,
driving a Buick. His mechanic

The Byers Case
Dodge City Kansas, Feb. 12
The first direct news of the
rumored developments in the
Nellie Byers murder case reach
ed Dodge City to day in a letter
received by a Dodge City girl
from a friend in New Ulysses.
The letter says a farm hand,
Orvell Slemp, has been arrested
by the Grant county officials and
as a result a new arrest in the
case is expected soon.
It was Slemp, a seventeen-year
old boy who lurnished the alibi
on which Cl'nt Henson, arrested
following the murder last Octob
er, after Miss Byers had been
assaulted and choked to death on
the way from her school to her
boarding house, was released.
Slerup sivore he was with Hen
sen, an ex-convict at the Liniger
farm, all afternoon of the day
the school teacher was killed.
Recently Slemp went to work
on the ranch of one of the couoty
officers and inadvertantly let fall
a clue that led to the renewal of
the investigation of the crime.
It is understood that Slemp,
Clint Henson, and the latter's
wife were taken to Moscow by
the officers who were investi
gating the clue.
Rumors that others are impli
cated and that only a part of the
story of the life of Nellie Byers
has been told, arc rampant in
New Ulysses, according to W. ()
Blackburn, a traveling salesman,
who was in that town on his trip
through the western part of the
staic. "Not one half the case
has been disclosed," Blackburn
told friends. "If certain Grant
county people get on the st;ind
and tell what they know the en
tire west half of Kansas will be
surprised. Many development

Drilling For Oil
Senator O. D, Young, of Kan
sas City, Missouri, was at the
Union depot this morning- en
route to Ashland, whence he will
depart north to his 21,000-acre
ranch on Bluff creek not far from
Kingsdown.
It is not generally known that
there is any drilling for oil as far
west as Clark county, but Sena
tor Young and Dave Fritzlen, an
adjoining ranchman, are drilling
a hole that is already down 2.600
feet with good prospects for
striking something.
The country is rough in that
neighborhood and Mr. Hatch, a
well-known Missouri geologist
is confident that oil exists in that
section. Already they have
reached the well known sand in
which oil is generally found.
While Senator Young is very
hopeful of results he is very care
ful about not letting his hopes
run too far. He told the Beacon
Ibis morning that, so far, they
had found nothing but they had
good prospects and splendid as
surance from the geologist,
whom be has known for many '
years as a very reliable scientist.
