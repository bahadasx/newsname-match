SCHOOL NOTICE.
Beginning with this week, the first
bell will ring at the Graded school
building at 8: 30 a .m. The bell will
ring again at 8:45, and from this time
until 9 o'clock, the doors of the school
building will be open for the admis
skm of tne pupiis. with this margin
of fifteen minutes, there is no reason
why any child should be compelled to
stand on- the cold ground outside
the school building each morning. We
hope the parents will co-operate with
us by not allowing their children to
come to school too early,, for they will
not be tardy unless they reach the
school grounds after nine p'clock
Teachers will be in their rooms every
morning at 8: 45-o'clock ready to. take
charge of the pupils as they go to their
rooms, and, I should add, that every
pupil will be expected to go directly
to his room. .
We make this new rule with the
nope that it will be of convenience. to
parents and be a greater safe-guard to
the health of the pupils. -

because of its untidiness.- Not pnly
was the space between the Nroad and
the house used as a calf pasture, but
it contained about as decrepit a col

could boast of. The lane that led up
to the side of the house and to .the
barnyard beyond was just "one clutter
of rotting lumber and junk," The
owner would not fallow any; of the
trees to be cut down so long as they
promised to bear fruit, and he would
not move, the calve? to. other quarters
because his father had always kept
them where the wife .could see them.
But the present wife and daughter
did not enjoy, the prospect of decrepit
fruit-trees, eevn' If there were calves
bamboling among them.' So they "put
up a Job on father." Whenever " the
boss would be away these two women
would chop down' one pf the trees, and
