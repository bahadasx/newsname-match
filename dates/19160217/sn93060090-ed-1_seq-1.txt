Denr Bro. Garrett; I have
.va question or two to ask you in
regard to some scriptures.
I see here in Gen. 2 8 this
' language- "And thn Lord God
planted a garden Eastward in
Eden and there he put the man
whom lie had formed,"
And in the 20 verse He says ;
"And Adam gave names to all
cattle and to the fowl of the air
and to every beast of the fie'd.
But for Adam there was not
found a helpmeet for him."
Now Dear Bro, I find in these
scriptures that the formed
man's name was Adam, which
was formed i after the seventh
day.
Then again I find in Gen. oth,
chapter that it says. "That this
is the book of the generations
of Adam in the day that Grd
-created man, in the likeness of
God made he him, male and fe
male created he them, and bless
ed them and called 'heir name
Adam in the dav worn they
were created.'1 oen. 6 1 2.
Now Dear Bro. it seems
strange to me that the formed
man's name was Adam also. If
these two Adams spoken of in

And he shall , judgs among

nations afar olf, and they shall
beat their swords inm plow,

neither shall they le.irn war any

SONG OF GRIEF
A little ball upon the floor,
A little nick upon the chair,
These two remind me more and more,
Of him who slumbers there,
He left the ball there in his play,
His little hammer made that nick;
Oh if he could come back to day
I'd let him Kick and nick and nick.
I scolded him for playing rough,
And slapped his little face
For scattering on the Moor his stulT
And by the fire place.
And he grew tired of his toys
And of the village street,
And so he went away, dear hoys,
Some dear now friends to meet
I picked the ball up from the "our,
And laid it on a shelf,
"It never will cotne do-vn no more,"
I said that to myself,
And then J cried while sorrow streamed
From out my every eye:
'Oh Billy Buy oh Billy Boy,
When will these tears be dry?"
But Billy did no answer make,
For Billy's eyes were closed.
And Billy's mother's heart did break;
And now she is a ghost.
And I am left alone, alone,
Here in this word ot woe.
And day and night 1 cry and morn
That I. too, soun may go.
A bettor land beyond the sea,
Awaits us,- you and me;
A better land, a brighter land,
For Billy Boy and me.
Yours in sorrow,

Wu sav to the sad and lonely heart,
There is a better clay a'.oining,
When dear friends shall never part.
In a beautiful laud of summer.
