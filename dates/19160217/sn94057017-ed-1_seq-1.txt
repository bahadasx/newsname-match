N. A. Wells accompanied E.

was his first visit to the Cedar

been without a commissioner for

The Combs family left Monday

of Mr. Combs' health and had
been here about six months. He
seemed to do pretty well for a
time, but latterly had been los

not the money to take them
home, but some of our charitably
disposed people contributed suf

Prince Albert
meets men's tastes
all over the world!
The patented process makes
Prince Albert so good in a pipe
or rolled into a cigarette that
its popularity is now uni
versal! It satisfies all smoke
desires! This patented process,
which also removes bite and
parch, is controlled by us. No
other tobacco can be like
Nunge Albert

Men who have stowed away gentle old jimmy pipes
for years, have brought them back to the tune of
Prince Albert! Get yours out, for your confidence
never will be abused I We tell you Prince Albert will
set pipe free the tenderest tongue I '
As the three Cox children were
driving home from school Wed
nesday evening in a cart, the
horse suddenly began kicking
and running. Une child jumped
from the cart and was unhurt.
The other two stayed in the cart
until the horse ran through a
wire fence and capsized the cart.
One child had his clothing torn
to shreds, but was scarcely hurt.
The other sustained some severe
bruises and cuts, but was not
dangerously hurt.
It is well known that news
paper men have troubles, and in
some cases bear their troubles
blushing thickly upon them, as
some other men bear their hon
ors. Occasionally it transpire?
that men of other callings have
troubles also. Just now the
genial secretary of the Roberson
Abstract Co. is in trouble and
doesn't know how to get out. A
few day3 ago he received a letter
from a customer a lady- in
which she upbraids him severely,
saying that he has now made the
third trial at fixing the title to
certain property, and hasn't got
a good title yet. Evidently the
good woman thinks the third
time ought to be a charm.
J. W. Walker of Lucy was in
Estancia last Friday. Mr. Walker
is the second man in the county
to adopt the silo. He made a
silo last summer twelve feet in
diameter and forty feet deep.
He tilled it with good ensilage
and is happy over the result. He
is feeding 21 head of cattle and
four horses, and his ensilase will
run them till about the 10th of
April.- He is milking eight cows,
and is getting far better results
than he ever got before on any
other kind of feed. Mr. Walker
is one of the Torrance county
settlers who has prospered, and
his operations show what can be
accomplished here. When he
settled on his homestead near
Luch he had a team, two cows
and 100 hens. Now he has four
horses, twenty-one head of cat
tle, 300 hens, a good silo, an en
silage cutter, considerable ad
ditional farm equipment, and an
addition to the family all in
three years. His income is from
the saleof cream and the pro
ducts of his chicken yard. He
has begun another silo, which he
will make fifty feet deep. He
will put the other one down an
additional ten feet, and he thinks
he will build both a few feet
above ground.. He has his plans
ready for a dairy barn whiiih will
be a reality in the course of the
year. He intends to try some
standard maize for ensilage this
season, though he will stick to
corn for the bulk of it. We are
glad to see Mr. Walker prosper,
both on his own account and be
cause his success will be an in
spiration to others. At present
he is milking eight cows, and
has five two-year-old heifers that
will be fresh soon.

A number of farmers are plow

County Commissioner Juan C.

Probate Judge Cesario Montoya
was here Saturday and held a
session of probate court.
Sheriff Meyer returned from
Texas last week with Rubt-rt E.
Howe, who has been placed in
the penitentiary at Santa Fe for
safe keeping pending the time
when he will be tried in the
court of this county.
The store of E. A. Mattingly
at Lucy was burglarized Satur
day night. Appaienily the bur
glars were looking for money,
whice they failed to find, and Hid
not take many articles from the
store. There is no clue iar as
we have heard.
The Valley Auto Co. recently
sold a Dodge car to E. H. Ayers,
two were sold to parties at En
cino.and a Ford to Melcar Luna
of Pinos Wells.
Among those who visited our
sick missionary, B. W. Means
last Sunday was Rev, E. B. At
wood, secretary of the Southern
Baptist Convention of Albuquer
que. While here he preached
two very impressive sermons.
We hope he will return again.
So far the month of February
has been remarkable for fine
weather. But two days are re
corded as windy, and every day
has been clear. The tempera
ture has gone to 50 or above
every day since the 3rd, and was
60 or above on seven days, reach
ing 69 on the 11th. The low
night record is on the 3rd 3
above zero.
C. B, Roland, who came from
Texas a month or two ago, has
bought the David Sanchez place
north of Silverton, and moved to
his new home this week. We
are glad to have Mr. Roland as a
permanent resident of the valley.
The place he bought is a good
one.
Saturday proved to be a "red-
letter" day for the Valley Auto
Co. Three Dodge Bros, cars and
one Ford were sold, making the
day's sales the largest in the
history of the company.
U. S. Commissioner Neal Jen-
son's office was busy all day Fri
day and Saturday and until mid
night Saturday nisrht with a con
test by the land office against Dr.
Ewing in the matter of his home
stead entry. The government
was represented by Special
Agents Selegue and Duncan, the
first as witness and the second
as attorney, and Dr. Ewing's at
torney was Fred H. Ayers.
The fear that nobody would
want to stand for office in New
Mexico this year in consequence
of which the wheels of govern
ment would cease to revolve, if
anybody had such a fear, has
now been dispelled. Frank Hub
bell has announced his candidacy
for the U. S. senate, following
which T. B. Catron announced
his desire to be re-elected to that
position. Secundino Romero,
brother of our fellow citizens
Cleofes and Raymundo Romero,
has been started in the race for
governor by the Repub'icans of
San Miguel countv. It is com
mon talk that H. O Bursum is a
candidate for that fio.-ition, a'id
it Í3 also understood that Rtlph
C Ely would consent tos rve the
people in the same capacity if
they would call loud enough for
him to hear. It is very likely
that this activity will encourage
the bashful ones to come out a'l
al ing the line, down to county
offices, and w.e may now fft-l he
cure th'ir, men will be found will
ing to fill all the offics, great
and small.
State Superintendent White
has made public statistics
in regard tc illiteracy in New
Mexico, from which we learn
that Torrance county ranks fair
ly well in this particular in com
parison with other counties of
the state. According t these
statistics Torrance county ranks
10th, 14.6 per cent of the popula
tion over 10 years of age being
unable to read or write. Curry
county ranks highest, with, only
1.3 per cent, while McKinley is
lowest with 60 5 per cent. In
1910 Torrance county had 290 il
literate voters, being 10 per
cenc. Roosevelt county ranks
highest in this respect, with 60
illiterate voters 1.7 per cent
McKinley is at the foot here
again, 1919 illiterate voters 51.7
tier o.nt Only six counties

the Manuel Sanchez place, which
adjoins Mr. Lane's homestead on
