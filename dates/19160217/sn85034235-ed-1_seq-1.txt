A Flutter In Eggs.
[T was in the A. C. company's big
store at Dawson that Lucille Ar
ral beckoned Smoke Bellew over
to the dry goods counter.
Smoke obeyed her call with alacrity.

would not have been battered by the

do something. It needs livening, and
you and I can do it I've broken with
Wild Water, you know."
Smoke caught two almost simulta
neous visions. One was of Joy Gas
toll. the other was of himself, in the
midst of a bleak snow stretch under
a cold arctic moon, being pot shotted
with accurateness and dispatch by the
aforesaid Wild Water. Smoke's re
luctance at raising excitement with the
aid of Lucille Arral was too patent for
her to miss.
"I'm not thinking what you are
thinking at all, thank you," she chided,
with a laugh and a pout "Take it
from me, Mr. Smoke Bellew, I'm not
going to make love to you, and if you
dare to make love to me Wild Water
will take care of your case. You know
him. Besides. I—I haven't really bro
ken with him. Wild Water thinks I've
broken with him. don't you see?"
"Well, have you. or haven't you?"
"I haven't—there! But it's between
you and me in confidence."
"Where do I come in. stalking horse
or fall guy?"
"Neither. You make a pot of money,
we put across the laugh on Wild Wa
ter and cheer Dawson up. and, best of
all and the reason for it all. he gets
disciplined. He needs it. He's—well,
the best way to put it is he's tooturbn
lent He broke out last night again.
Sowed the floor of the M. & M. with
gold dust—all of a thousand dollars.
You've heard of it. of course."
"Yes; this morning. But still 1 don'
get you."
"Listen. He was too turbulent I
broke our engagement and he's going
around making a noise like a broken
heart Now we come to it I like
eggs."
"But what have eggs and appetite
got to do with it?" Smoke demanded.
"Everything. 1 like eggs. There's
only a limited supply of eggs In Daw
son."
"Sure. Slavovitchs restaurant has
most of them. Ham and one egg. $3;
ham and two eggs, $5. That means $2
an egg. retail."
"He likes eggs too.'' she continued.
"But that's not the point 1 like them
I have breakfast every morning at 11
o'clock at Slavovitch's. 1 invariably
eat two eggs." She paused impressive
ly. "Suppose, just suppose, avoebody
corners eggs."
She waited, and Smoke regarded her
with admiring eyes, while in his heart
he backed with approval Wild Water's
• hoice of her.
"You're not following." she said.
"Go on," he replied. "1 give np
What's the answer?"
"Stupid! You know Wild Water.
When he sees I'm languishing for
eggs, and I know his mind like a book
and 1 know how to languish, what
will he do? Why, he'll Just start
stampeding for the man that's got the
corner in eggs. He'll buy the corner,
no matter what it costs.
"Picture: I come info Slavovitch's at
II o'clock. Wild Water will be at the
next table. He'll make it his business
to be there. 'Two eggs, shirred.' I'll
say to the waiter. 'Sorry. Miss Arral.
the waiter will say, 'they ain't no
more eggs.' Then up speaks Wild Wa
ter in that big bear voice of his, 'Wal
is
to
ter, six eggs, soft boiled.' And the
waiter says, 'Yes, sir.' and the eggs
are brought. Picture: Wild Water
looks sideways at me, and l look like
a particularly indignant icicle and
summon the waiter. 'Sorry, Miss Ar
rak' he says, 'but them eggs is Mr.
Wild Water's. You see, miss, he owns
'em.' Picture: Wild Water, trium
phant doing his best to look uncon
scious while he eats his six eggs.
"Another picture: Slavovitch himself
bringing two shirred eggs to me and
saying: 'Compliments of Mr. Wild Wa
ter, miss.' What can I do? What can
l possibly do but smile at Wild Water?
And then we make up, of course, and
he'll consider it cheap if he has been
compelled to pay 510 for each and ev
ery egg In the corner."
"Go on. go on!" Smoke urged. "At
what station do I climb on to thechoo
choo cars or at what water tank do 1
get thrown off?"
"Ninny! You make that corner in
eggs. You start in immediately, to
day. You can buy every egg in Daw
son for $3 and sell out to Wild Water
at almost any advance. And then,
afterward. we'U let the inside history
come out. The laugh will be on Wild
Water. Bis turbulence will be some
subdued. You and I share the glory
of it You make a pile of money. And
Dawson wakes up with a grand ha.
ha!"
"Hey, ShortyP Smoke called across
the main street to his partner and
crossed over. "I want you to do me a
favor."
"Sure," Shorty said gallantly. "What
is it? Let her rip."
"1 want you to buy eggs for me"—
"Sure, an' Floridy water an' talcum
powder, if you say the word. Look
here, Smoke, if you want to go in for
high livin' you go an' buy your own
eggs."
"1 am going to buy, but I want you
to help me to buy. You go right
straight to Slavovitch's. Pay as high
as ?3, but buy all he's got"
'Three dollars!" Shorty groaned.
'An' I beard tel! only yesterday that
he's got all of 700 in stock! Twenty
one hundred dollars for hen fruiL Say.
Smoke, I'd sure do anything for you.
If you had a cold in the head an' was
layin' with both arms broke I'd set by
your bedside day an' night an' wipe
your nose for you. but I'll be everlast
in'ly d—d if I'll squander tweuty-oue
hundred good iron dollars on hen fruit
for you or any other two legged man."
They're not your dollars, but mine.
Shorty. It's a deal I have on. What
I'm after is to corner every blessed
egg In Dawson, in the Klondike, on the
Yukon. You've got to help me out. i
haven't the time to tell you of the in
wardness of the deal. I will after
ward and let you go half ou it if you
want to. But the thing right now is
to get the eggs. Now, you hustle up to
Slavovitch's and buy all he's got. And
then keep on. Nose out every egg in
Dawson and buy it Understand?
Buy it!"
Never was a market cornered more
quickly. In three days every known
egg in Dawson with the exception of
several dozen w*as in the hands of
Smoke and Shorty.
The several dozen not yet gathered
in were in the hands of two persons.
One, with whom Shorty was dealing,
was an Indian woman who lived in a
cabin on the hill back of the hospital.
"I'll get her today," Shorty announc
ed nest morning. "I'll be back in a
jiffy, if I don't bust myself a-sbovin 1
dust at her."
In the afternoon when Smoke re
turned to the cabin he found Shorty.
"What luck?" Shorty asked careless
ly after several minutes had passed.
"Nothing doing." Smoke answered.
"How did you get on with the squaw?"
Shorty cocked his head triumphant
ly toward a tin pail of eggs on the ta
ble. "Seven dollars a clatter, though."
he confessed.
"I offered $10 finally," Smoke said,
"and then the fellow told me he'd al
ready sold his eggs. Now that looks
bad. Shorty. Somebody else is in the
market. Those twenty-eight eggs are
liable to cause us trouble. You see.
the success of the corner consists in
holding every last"—
He broke off to stare at his partner.
A pronounced change was coming over
Shorty—one of agitation masked by
extreme deliberation. "Do you mind
kindly just repeatin' over how many
eggs you said the man didn't sell to
you?" he asked.
"Twenty-eight"
"Hum!" Shorty communed to him
self. "They's just exactly, precisely
nor nothin' more or anything less'n
twenty-eight eggs in that there pail
settin' on the table, an' they cost, every
dinged last one of 'em. just exactly
seven great big round iron dollars a
throw. If you stand in crytn' need of
any further items of information I'm
willin' and free to impart"
"Go on." Smoke requested.
"Well, that geezer you was dickerin'
with is a big buck Indian. Am 1
right?"
Smoke nodded and continued to nod
to each question.
"He's got one cheek half gone, where
a bald face grizzly swatted bim. Am I
right? He's a dog trader—right, eh?
His name is Scar Face Jim. That's so.
ain't it? D'ye get my drift?"
"Yon mean we've been bidding"—
"Against each other? Sure thing.
That squaw's his wife, an' they keep
house on the hill back of the hospital.
] could a' got them eggs for two a
throw if you hadn't butted in."
"And so could I," Smoke laughed. "It
you'd kept out But it doesn't amount
to anything. We know that we've got
the corner. That's the big thing."
Shorty spent the nest hour wrestling
with a stub of a pencil on the margin
<>! a three-year-old newspaper.
"There she stands." he said at last
"Lem me give yon the totals. You un

$10 an egg we stand to win, clean net
an' all to the good, just exactly 56,
970."
At 11 that night Smoke was routed
from sound sleep by Shorty.
"1 just seen Slavovitch: He says to
me: 'Shorty, 1 want to speak to you
about them eggs. I've kept it quiet
Nobody knows i sold 'em to you. But
if you're speculatin' 1 can put you wise
to n good thing.' An' he did, too.
Smoke.
"Well, maybe it sounds uncredlble,
but that good thing was Wild Water
Charley. He's lookin' to buy eggs. He
goes around to Slavovitch an' offers
him $5 an egg, an' before he quits he's
offerin' $S. An' Slavovitch ain't got no
eggs. List thing Wild Water sayo to
Slavovitch is that he'll heat the head
offen him if he ever finds out Slavo
vitch has eggs cached away some
wheres. Slavovitch had fc tell'm he'd
sold the eggs, but that the buyer was
secret.
"Slavovitch says to lef him say the
word to Wild Water, who's got the
eggs. 'Shorty.' he says to me, 'Wild
Water'll come a-runniu'. You can hold
him up for $S. 'Eight, dollars your
grandmother,' 1 says. 'He'll fall for
$10 before I'm done with him.' Any
way, I told Slavovitch I'd think it over
and let him know in the momtn'. Of
course we'll let'm pass the word on to
Wild Water. Am I right?"
"You certainly are. Shorty. First
thing in the morning tip off Slavovitch.
Have bim tell Wild Water that you
and i are partners in the deal."
In the morning Smoke chanced upon
Lucille Arral again at the dry goods
counter of the A. C. store.
"It's working!" he Jtfbilated. "It's
working! Wild Water's been around
to Slavovitch. trying to buy or bully
eggs out of him. And by this time
Slavovitch has told him that Shorty
and I own the corner."
Lucille Arral's eyes sparkled with de
light. "I'm going to breakfast right
now," she cried. "And I'll ask the
waiter for eggs aud be so plaintive
when there aren't any as to melt a
heart of stoue. And you know Wild
Water's heart Is anything but stone
He'll buy the corner if it costs him one
of his mines. Hold out for a stiff fig
ure. Nothing less than $10 wili satisfy
me. and if you sell for anything less.
Smoke, I'll never forgive you."
That noon, up in their cabin. Shorty
placed on the table a pot of beans, a
pot of coffee, a smoking platter of
moose meat and bacon, a plate of
stewed dried peaches and called.
"Grub's ready!"
Smoke opened the door for a breath
of frosty air and saw something that
made him close the door hurriedly and
dash to the stove. The frying pan. still
hot from the moose meat and bacon,
he put back on the front lid. Into the
frying pan he put a generous dab of
butter, then reached for an egg, which
he broke and dropped spluttering into
the pan. As he reached for a second
egg Shorty gained iiis side and clutched
his arm in an excited grip.
"Hey. what you doin'?" he demanded.
"Frying eggs." Smoke informed him.

off Shorty's detaining hand. "Get out

of the way. Shorty. Wild Water's com
ing up the hill, and he'll bo here in five
minutes."
Shorty sat down at the table. By the
time the expected knock came at the
door Smoke was facing him across the
tabic, and before each was a plate con
taining three hot fried eggs.
"Come in!" Smoke called.
Wild Water Charley, a strapping
young giant, entered and shook hands.
"Set down an' have a bite, Wild Wa
ter," Shorty invited. "Smoke, fry him
some eggs. I'll bet he ain't scoffed an
egg in a coon's age."
Smoke broke three more eggs into
the hot pan and in several minutes
placed them before his gnest. who look
id at them with so strange and strain
ed an expression that Shorty confessed
afterward his fear that Wild Water
would slip them Into his pocket and
tarry them away.
"Say, them swells down in the states
ain't got nothin' over us in the matter
of eats," Shorty gloated. "Here's you
an' me an' Smoke gettin' outside $90
wortli of eggs au' not battln' an eye."
Wild Water stared at the rapidly dis
appearing eggs and seemed petrified.
"They—they ain't worth no $10,"
Wild Water said slowly.
Shorty accepted the challenge. "A
thing's worth what you can get for it.
ain't it?" he demanded.
"Yes, but—you can't eat eggs like
that," Wild Water objected. "It—it
ain't right.''
"YVe just dote on eggs. Smoke an
me," was Shorty's excuse.
Wild Water finished his own plate In
a half hearted way "Say, you fellows
can do me n great favor," he began
tentatively. "Sell me. or lend me, or
give me, about a dozen of them eggs."
"Sure." Smoke answered. "I know
what a yearning for eggs is myself
But we're not so poor that we have to
sell our hospitality. They'll cost you
nothing. Go ahead. Shorty. Cook
them up for him."
But Wild Water laid a restraining
hand on the eager Shorty as he ex
plained. "I don't mean cooked. I want
them with the shells on."
"So that you can carry 'em away?"
'That's the idea."
"But that ain't hospitality." Shorty
objected. "It's—it's tradin'."
Smoke nodded concurrence. "That's
different. Wild Water. 1 thought you
just wanted to eat them. You see. we
went into this for a speculation."
The dangerous blue of Wild Water's
eyes began to grow more dangerous.
"I'll pay you for them," he said sharp
ly. "How much?"
"Oh, not a dozen." Smoke replied.
"We couldn't sell a dozen. We're not
retailers; we're speculators. We can't
break our own market We've got a
hard and fast corner, and when we sell
out it's the whole corner or nothing."
"How many have you got and how
much do you want for them?"
"How many have we. Shorty?"
Smoke inquired.
Shorty cleared his throat and per
formed mental arithmetic aloud. "Lem
me see. Nine hundred an" seventy
three minus nine, that leaves nine hun
dred an' sixty-two. An' the whole
shootin' match at 510 a throw will
tote up just about nine thousand six
hundred an' twenty iron dollars. Of
course, Wild Water, we're playin' fair
an' it's money back for bad ones
though they ain't none. That's one
thing 1 never seen in the Klondike—a
bad egg."
Wild Water shook his head sadly and
helped himself to the beans. "That
would be too expensive. Shorty, i only
want a few. I'll give you $10 for a
couple of dozen. I'll give you $20, but
I can't buy 'em ail."
"Ail or none." was Smoke's ultima
tum.
"Look here, you two," Wild Water
said in a burst of confidence. "I'll be
perfectly honest with you, an' don't let
it go any further. You know Miss Ar
ral an' 1 was engaged. Well, she's
broken everything off. It's for her I
want them eggs. I want to give them
to her on a platter shirred. That's the
way she likes 'em."
"Do you want 'em ninety-six hundred
an' twenty dollars' worth?" Shorty
queried.
"Aw, listen to reason." Wild Water
pleaded. "1 only want a couple of
dozen. I'll give you $20 apiece for 'em,
What do 1 want with all the rest of
them eggs?"
"I should say Miss Areal's worth the
price of the eggs," Smoke put in
quietly.
"Worth It?" Wild Water stood up In
the heat of his eloquence. "She's worth
a million dollars. She's worth all the
dust in Klondike. But that ain't no
call for me to gamble $10,000 on
breakfast for her. Now, I've got
proposition. Lend me a couple of dozen
of them eggs. I'll turn 'em over
Slavovitch. He'll feed 'em to her with
my compliments. She ain't smiled to
me for a hundred years. If them eggs
get a smile for me I'll take the whole
boiling off your hands."
"Will you sign a contract to that ef
fect?" Smoke said quickly, for he knew
that Lucille Arral had agreed to smile.
Wild Water gasped. "You're almighty
swift with business up here on the
hill." he said, with a hint of a snarl.
"We're only accepting your own
proposition." Smoke answered.
"All right; bring on the paper: make
it out hard and fast," Wild Water cried

CHAPTER XX.
Four Years Old.
MOKE wrote the document,
wherein Wild Water agreed to
take every egg delivered to him
at $10 per egg. provided that
the two dozen advanced to him
brought about a reconciliation with
Lucille Arral.
Wild Water paused with uplifted pen
as he was about to sign. "Hold on," !
he said. "When 1 buy eggs I buy good j
eggs. If 1 find one had egg you've got
to come back with the $10 I paid for
it"
"That's all right," Smoke placated.
"It's only fair."
Smoke inserted the word "good" in
the contract, and Wild Water sullenly
signed, received the trial two dozen In
a tin pail, pulled on his mittens and
opened the door.
"Goodby. you robbers," be growled
back at them and slammed the door.
Smoke was a witness to the play
next morning at Slavoritcb's. He sat,
as Wild Water's guest, at the table ad
joining Luciile Arral's. Almost to the
letter, as she had forecast it, did the
scene come off.
"Haven't you found any eggs yet?"
she murmured plaintively to the waiter.
"No. ma'am," came the answer.
"They say somebody's cornered every
egg in Dawson. Mr. Slavovitch is try
ing to buy a few just especially for
you. Rut the fellow that's got the cor
ner won't let loose."
It was at this juncture that Wild
Wafir beckoned the proprietor to him.
and, with one hand on his should«?,
drew his head down. "Look here,
Slavovitch." Wild Water whispered
hoarsely, "l turned ever a couple of
dozen eggs to you last night Where
are they?"
"In the safe, all but that six I have
all thawed and ready for yon any
time you sing out"
"I don't want 'em for myself," Wild
Water breathed in a still lower voice.
"Shirr 'em up and present 'em to Miss
Arral there."
"I'll attend to it personally myself,"
Slavovitch assured him.
"An' don't forget—compliments of
me," Wild Water concluded, relaxing
his detaining clutch on the proprietor's
shoulder.
Pretty Lucille Arral was gazing for
lornly at the strip of breakfast bacon
and the tinned mashed potatoes on her
plate when Slavovitch placed before
her two shirred eggs.
"Compliments of Mr. Wild Water,"
they at the next table heard him say.
Smoke acknowledged to himself that
it was a fine bit of acting—the quick,
joyous flash in the face of her. the im
pulsive turn of the head, the spontane

j
ous forerunner of a smile that was
only checked by a superb self control
which resolntely drew her face back
so that she could say something to the
restaurant proprietor.
Smoke felt the kick of Wild Water's
moccasined foot under tile table.
"Will she eat 'em—that's the ques
tion-will she eat 'em?" the latter
whispered agonizingly.
And with sidelong glances they saw
I.ucille Arral hesitate, almost push the
dish from her, then surrender to its
lure.
"I'll take them eggs," Wild Water
said to Smoke. "The contract holds.
Did you see her? Did you see her?
She almost smiled. 1 know her. It's
all fixed. Two more eggs tomorrow
an' she'll forgive an' make up. If she
wasn't here I'd shake hands. Smoke,
I'm that grateful. You ain't a robber;
you're a philanthropist."
Smoke returned jubilantly up the hill
to the cabin only to find Shorty in
black despair.
"It's all off with the big Swede," he
groaned. "The corner's busted. What
d'ye tbink I run into? A geezer with
three thousan' eggs—d'ye get me?—
three thousan' an' Just freighted in
from Forty Mile."
"Gautereaux's his name, a whackin'

It was our cornerin' eggs that got him

Smoke found Wild Water at the M.

WILD GOOSE LIFE.
Tha Gander Is a Master of Strategy
and a Fierce Fighter.
We know nothing of the courtship
of the wild goose, but we feel assured
that It must be a seemly and worthy
affair. Once mated, there is no fur
ther need for vows and protestations,
for the birds mate for life. Together
they unite in building the nest, but tha
goose alone watches over the eggs,
while day and night the gander weaves
in all directions on water and on land
his trails of watchfulness.
Neither man nor beast may approach
without being fiercely and successfully
assailed, buffeted and routed by a re
lentless attack with beak and wings.
This guardianship Is trebled when the
new generation, helpless and depend
ent, voices its first need for protec
tion from the perils which encompass
and beset ft
If, perchance, the small family elects
to remain on the shore the parents
will circle round and round the group
of golden goslings, and if danger
threatens from any one direction the
gander, by some miracle of strategy,
will succeed in placing himself at the
one vulnerable point of his intrench
ment His loyalty, astuteness and un
selfishness are not to be found in tnose
unobservant folk who have presumed
to slander him.
In swimming the strictest discipline
is maintained. The young form in
single file, following the mother, while
the gander brings up the rear, with
eyes constantly sweeping the whole
range of vision. His vigil Is ceaseless
and untiring.
Such Is the life of these two birds
that are mated in more than sex, and
when death comes to one or the other
of them we know that many times the
one that remains will seek no other
mate, but will return each spring to
the site of his former nest, which he
will never renew again.—Atlantic.

For Not Killing the Army Chief Who
Had Struck Him.
In France in the seventeenth century
the office of sentinel was a very solemn
charge, and a part of the sentinel's
duty was to resent and punish any af.
front The severity of this punish
ment was in proportion to the high im
portance of his office. A Frenchman
relates an incident illustrative of this
fact:
. In 1622 M. de Marti lac rode away on -
horseback from an audience with the
king. His horse stepped oh a senti
nel's foot The man struck the horse,
which leaped forward and shock M. de
Marlllac in his saddle.
The rider turned and struck the sen
tinel. The soldier belonged to the com
pany of M. de Goas, who when lie
heard of this bad him arrested and im
prisoned. He himself set out. sword
in hand, in search of M. de Marlllac to
demand satisfaction for an insult to his
sentinel.
The king wits informed or the Inci
dent and sent for M. de Goas and M.
de Marillac. ne reprimanded de Marik
lac severely, told him that the sentinel
should have killed him and forbade
him to exercise his command as chief
marshal for six days.
The sentinel was tried before a coun
cil of war nud was sentenced as a pen
alty for not killing De Marlllac to be
deprived of his arms In the presence of
his regiment aud to be tortured by the
strappado—that is. to be hoisted by a
rope to n beam and let fail. The king
pardoned the man, but M. de Goas
would not have him in his company
again.—Washington Star.
Paddled Away In a Coffin.
Several men have succeeded in es
caping from Devil's Island, where Cap
tain Dreyfus was confined. One bold
prisoner escaped from tils cell during
a dark night and forced his way into
a shed where coffins were made. Se
lecting a large shell, he nailed the lid
down in such a way that a hole was
left big euough for him to crawl into.
Then he raided a storehouse and stole
a supply of food, which he placed in
side the coffin. His next proceeding
was to drag the coffin and Its contents
down to the water's edge. Reaching
it in safety, be launched his sepulchral
vessel, crawled into it and paddled
away by means of his bands,
isand never saw him again.

Too Much Push.
"Yon must push matters a little,
James," said a druggist to his new
boy. "By calling a customer's atten

you often effect a sale."
"Yes, sir," responded the new boy,
and then he hastened to wait upon an
elderly person who wanted, a stamp.
"Anything else, mum?" inquired the
nmbitious boy politely. "Ilair dye, cos
metic, face powder, rheumatic drops,
belladonna, mole destroyer"—
The elderly lady deals over the way
