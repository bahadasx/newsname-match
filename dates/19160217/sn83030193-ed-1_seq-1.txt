Tho Olllclnl Messenger estimates the

as 100,000. It Is also estimated that
noro than 1,000 Rims were captured,
Tbeso Included 467 suns la the outer

many field suns.
Tho first official" news of tho fall ot
the stronghold In Turkish Armenia

despatch to tho Czar by (ho Grand
Duke Nicholas:
"God has granted to the brave
troops of the Army of tho Cau
casus such assistance that En
arum has been taken, after five
days of assault without precedent.
I am Inexpressibly happy to an
nounce this victory to Your Im
perial Majesty."
Tho Tuftdsh garrison was believed
to hava been commanded by German
Field Marshals Count von der Gotta:
and LI man von Sunders. The city
was on flro as tho Russians marched
in, and tho first work of a largo force
ot tho victors was to fight against a
irprcad of tho flames.
Tho roport of the Russian victory
has been followed by tho greatast
demonstration since the capture of
Prremysl. Great crowds marched
through tho streets, waving the Uus

BABY IS NOT HERS
SAYS PRINCESS IN
REPLY TO HUSBAND
The Former Aimee Crocker
Gouraud Fights Prince
Miskinoff's Suit.
Surrounded by a cordon of attor-J
ncys and a rotlnue of secretaries and
servants, Princess Almee Crockor
i Gouraud-Mlsklnoff to-day appeared
In Justice Bljur's part of the Su
' premo"Courf to Tight a legal separa
I tlan from her latest matrimonial ac
, qulsltion, Prince Aloxander Mlsklnoff.
; As tho case was not ready tho
princess, heavily veiled, stolo Into an
unoccupied court room with her en
tourago to escape curious eyes. In
the folds of a flowing velvet coat
sho carefully shielded her foster
daughter Yvonne Gouraud, tho chic
and golden tressed little maid who,
tho prince claims, was given to him
to love and cherish whllo the princess
wus In ono of her "heroic and gallant
moods."
Tho prlnco meandered about the
court houso unconcernedly with his
attorney, John C. Oldmlxon. They
carefully avoided tho princess and
her party. Incidentally, Mr. Oldmlxon
locked his right arm about a fat
portfolio as though It was tho most
precious belonging In tho world. It
contained tho princess's letters to
her "Honey Darling," the prince; alsj
a fat little collection of billet dcu
from Yvonne.
Tho prlnco does not apeak Knghsli
well, so his attorney talked.
According to J'- 01dmlr-n the trial
would develop two Issues us the cause
of irreconcilable differences between
tho pair. First, sold the lawyer, tho
Prlnco would provo b" tho packets of
letters and other evidence that Yvonne,
tho Dresden doll foster daughter, was
given lo him outright by tho Princess.
"It was a case where Yvonno, who
was rapidly reaching a debutante's
ago and wanted to do something for
herself In socloty," said Mr. Oldmlxon.
"Tho prince had professed admiration
for tho littlo girl and sho for him.
Tho princess seemed to realize that
she was not as young and attractive
us sho had been, but was not willing
to glvo up Yvonne.
"Yvonno grew despcrato and
threatened her own death by shoot
ing, and then It was thut Madame
Mlsklnoff, In a noblo and heroic sac
rifice, gavo her consent to a strange
trlangulnr situation and exiled
Yvonno nnd tho Prlnco to Kdgemcro,
where they woro to determine by
constant association whether their
affection for each other was as
strong ns thoy bclloved. Tho let
ters will provo this."
On tho other hand, tho lawyer ex
plained Mme. Mlsklnoff, ns hn con
tinued to call her, would endeavor
to provo that thcro was no Infant
child of her marriage, to tho prince,
the existence) of v. hich, tho lawyer
added, would bo amply proved by
evidence
Tho princess has stoutly denied that
sho is tho mother and lias stated on
previous occasions that such a child
existed only in tho fcrtllo mind of tho
prince. The prince will contend, Ills

that Jean Crones, tho chof wanted

It was at first thought possibly by

tical with words found in other let

Presenco of a second poison men
tioned in the Crones lettor as having
been put in the soup served at the
banquet was discovered to-day in
tests by the city chemists. The poison
found was of a metallic nature, ac
cording to chemists, which would
quickly induce excessive nausea, and
so tend to counteract the effcet of
the other poison mingled with it,
Chicago detectives havo been sent

running Crones down. Pollco hero

ASKS NEW PLEDGE
Demands That Germany Will
Not Sink Liners Even if

WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. Secre
tary Lansing to-day accepted the
Lusltjnla agreement as satisfactory
to tho United States In so far as It re
lates totUat case, but asked Count'
von Bernstorff, the German Ambas
sador, for assurances Hint Germany
will not carry Its policy of sinking
merchant ships without warning to
liners, even If they carry defensive
armament.
This announcement came after a
visit of Count von Bernstorff to Sec-
rctary Lansing. Tho conference, It
was explained, wni at Secretary
Lansing's request.

to the Ambassador the position of
the I'nited StatPs In the light of tho
now dovelepoments, nnd Is under
stood to hnvo told him thnt tho United
States must insist that Germany con
form all her practices to International
law, inasmuch as tho Kntento Allies

Tho Lusltanta agreement will bo
kept by Secretary Lansing and later
will bo published, with tho usstirances
which thu United States hopes to re
celvo from Germany covering tho
points brought up by the new sub
ma line campaign.

given, would bo embodied in a sup-
nratu note. Moanwhllo, It was said

It was understood the principal ob
jection bv the United Stutes to accept
ing the Lusltanla agreement us gov
erning the futuro wns that it meroly
referred to thu assurances previously
given that unresisting liners would not
1(0 sunk without warning, but it did
not actually embody or rclterut them.

returned to his Embassy, sent ft long
despatch to Ills Government setting

States us Secretary Lansing hud out
lined. It was stated nittliorltiitlviily that

nut the recommendation of tho mi
nority of tho llrowii Tux Investigat

"Ilvcry dollui which the Suite Is
obliged to pay meuns that New Yurk

amendment. "Tho Stuto has been
palng to up-Stato counties and mu
nicipalities us taxes upon Its forest
lands about $190,000 annually and
New York City, therefore, pays In
dlrectlv to these up-9tatu countlos
about 1130.000 a year.
"The practice Is unfair. The State's
property In New York CHy and oilier

should there b a discrimination In
