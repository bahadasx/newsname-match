INDIAN LAND TAXABLE.
Treasurer Dabney has contended
since his election to office last wint
er that all Indian land where patent
had been issued was subpect to tax
ation, and has been working with
Indian agents and other officials to
find out if he is right. At different
times he has had opinions from one
and another, some contending he
was right, and others that he was
wrong, and that Indian land was not
taxable. The first of the week he
received word from Washington
stating where patent had been is
sued the land as subject to taxation.
This will mean a great deal to the
people of Phillips county, as there
are thousands of acres of land held
by Indians on which a patent has
been issued.
