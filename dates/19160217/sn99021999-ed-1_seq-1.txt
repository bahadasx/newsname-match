The capture of Krxerum haa been the
objective of the recent campaign of the

Von Der Goltz was In command at Kr
erora with 80.000 men: that their escape
had been cut off and that they had oro-
vlalons for only a fortnight. A relief
expedition was sent by the Turks, but
It was reported these foroes had been
defeated by the Russians with heavy

Krxerum Is about sixty miles west of
the Russian border, lta capture. If ac

TREASURY LOWER DAY BY 'DAY
(From a Staff Correspond nt.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 16. (Spe
cial Telegram.) The riscal failures
of the democratic party are becom
ing more and more conspicuous as
the majority of the ways and means
committee wrestles with the grave
problems of how to stop the contin
ual emptying of the treasury.
Notwithstanding the stimulation
of a war revenue law the best evi
dence of the failure of the 1'nder
wood tariff for the revenue MM 13
found in the dally balance sheet is
Biied from the department over
which Secretary McAdoo presides.
So serious is the situation that the
democrats of the ways and means
committee has about decided to
bring in a bill covering four Rrcat
questions:
First The law removing the duly from
etiRar la to be repealed and that Industry
once more protected, which will bring
some relief to a very Jaded money chest
This, according to reliable sources, Is
approved by the president and agreed
to by Chairman Kllchln.
Second Conl tar dyes are to be pro
tected and the Industry fostered, t'pon
this it seems the president, all republi
cans and most of the democrats were
agreed.
Third A section Is to be added to the
democratic measure which Is designed to
prevent cheap goods from abroad flood
ing our markets at the closo of the war.
This clause, of the bill Is at once the
acme, the xentth and the qulnteaoenre of
protection. It Is expected the president
favors this leslslatlon as do nearly all
the democrats.
Fourth A tariff commission ia pro
posed to take the place of that estab
lished by the republicans and destroyed
by the democrats. This feature Is favored
by the president and most of ' the demo
crats though not favored by Majority
Leader Kltchln.
Thus Is change written over everything
democratic, with one exception: The
change In the treasury; that is getting
lesa every day.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 1C. Later

communication was being studied
closely to determine If anything

WHITMAN AND BARNES FIGHT
NEW VONK, Feb. 16. The re
publican national campaign will bo
waged as a fight for adequate mili
tary preparedness nd tariff reform,
opposition to granting early inde
pendence to the Philippines and in
sistence on a vigorous stand for
American rights, both in Mexico and
In relation to the European war, ac
cording to the "key note" platform
adopted today by the republican
state convention.
The outlines of . the platform,
whith was approved unanimously,
wer presented last night in the
speech of former Senator Ellhu Root,
There was no difference of opinion
apparent anion g tha 832 delegates
in regard 'lo' the " pla(form. but a
bitter fight was precipitated by tha
attempt of the supporters of Got
ernor Whitman to obtain an un
qualified endorsement of his admin
istration and to force. his nomina
tion as chairman of the delegation
to the national convention in Chi
cago. Will tie I nlnstrncied.
The net result waa that New York atat
will send an unlnatructed delegation to
the national convention If the action of
the convention Is upheld by the voter at
the primary election In April.
A determined fight led by Henry L.
Htlnwion to obtain a reaolutlon reoom
mending Mr. Root aa New York's favor
ite aon for the prealdency waa defeated
in the convention on reaolutlon and a
counter reaolutlon that no presidential
candidate be endorsedwas passed unan
imously. Tha principal ground upon which tha
opponent of the Root reaolutlon fought
waa that an endorsement of Mr. Root
would preclude tha possibility of New
York putting forward Justice Charlea B.
Hughe as tha state's candidate for tha
presidency. Nicholas Murray Butler,
chairman of the committee. Issued a
formal statement In which ha aald Mr.
Root himself was' oppoaed to tha us of
hla name.
The big battle In theconvention wa
fought out between tha "old line" organ
ization republican under tha leadership
of William Hames and the supporters
of Governor Whitman.
Plan of Barnes Mti.
The Rarnea men entered tha convention
with the avowed purpose of refusing an
endorsement of the Whitman administra
tion and preventing the governor from
heading the New York delegation to tha
national convention.
The question of endorsement ended In
a compromise by which two' resolutions
were presented, one dealing exclusively
with national affairs and tha other "com
mending" Governor Whitman's conduct
of the state administration.
. This partial victory ot Ue governor waa
offsets by a complete defeat on tha ques
tion of national delegatea. The Whitman
forces had united all their strength In
an effort to nominate David Jayne Hill
of Rochester as one of tha "big four."
The Baraea faction declared themaelvea
91 posed to Dr. Hill and presented In
stead the name of Wl'llam Berrl of
lirooklyn. After a fight which lasted four
hours the committee on delegates finally
agreed on l'nlted Blates Senator Jameaa
VV. Wadsworth, Jr., Charlea B. Whitman,
Frederick C. Tanner and Klon B. Brown,
republican leader In the state senate. Aa
As Wadsworth, Tanner and Brown area
reputed anti-Whitman men the commit
tee's decision waa accepted aa a defeat
for Governor Whitman.
