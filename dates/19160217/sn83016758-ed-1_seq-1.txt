PRESIDENTMAKERS Many Minnesotans Eager to Assist in
Naming Candidates for Presi-
dent and Vice-President.
Minnesota Democrats Are All for
Woodrow WilsonRepublicans
Not United on Any Candidate.
The republican national convention
to nominate candidates for president
and vice-president is to convene in
Chicago on June 7, and the democratic
national convention convenes a week
later in St. Louis.
The presidential primary election to
choose delegates to the national con
ventions of all political parties is held
in \his state on town meeting day, the
second Tuesday of March, which this
year is the 14th of March.
The intent of the fool primary law
was to give each individual voter an
opportunity to express his preference
for a presidential candidate, at least
that is what was claimed for it by the
faddists who pushed it through the
legislature. But it does nothing of the
kind.
In the first place, under the provis
ions of the law a petition, to which
not less than 500 signatures of voters
is attached, must be filed with the sec
retary of state for each presidential
candidate. Candidates for delegates
must file an affidavit with the secre
tary of state and in that affidavit ex
press their preference for a presiden
tial candidate, but their choice must
be confined to the presidential candi
dates whose petitions have been filed
as above related. For instance, a
large number of voters may favor
Roosevelt, but they cannot vote for
Roosevelt delegates as no petition has
been filed for Roosevelt in this state.
Root has many supporters in Minne
sota, and in at least two congressional
districts he would be the first choice
of a majority of the republican voters
thereof, but Root cannot get a dele
gate from this Aate because his
friends have not filed a petition, and
voters who favor Roosevelt and Root
have no means of recording their pref
erence.
There will be only two republican
candidates voted on this state
Cummins and Estabrook. Cummins
is a United States senator from Iowa
and haiS considerable of a following
this state, but we do not for a mo
ment believe he is the first choice of a
majority of the republicans of the
state. It is our deliberate judgment
that Theodore Roosevelt is the repub
lican favorite in Minnesota. Estabrook
who the duece is he, anyhow? Not
one in a hundred citizens of the state
ever heard of him before. But he has
some money and his agents came to
Minneapolis and hired some young
fellows to circulate his petition, and
men were secured in each con
gressional district and in the state at
large to file under his name. As only
the requisite number of candidates
for delegates have filed under Esta
brook's name it is not impossible that
he may get some delegates from this
state. To illustrate, four candidates
have filed for delegates-at-large under
Estabrook's name, while 19 have filed
under Cummins' name. Now the four
delegates receiving the highest num
ber of votes will be declared the duly
elected delegates from the state. The
Cummins vote will be divided between
19 candidates and there is only four
to elect. Every vote cast for the Es
tabrook group of four will count. Then
through ignorance or inadvertence
there will be undoubtedly many votes
cast for the Estabrook delegates.
As a matter of fact no one fully
conversant with the political situation
expects that either Cummins or Es
tabrook will be nominated. Then the
only thing to do is to vote for the
best men as delegates and trust them
to do the right thing at Chicago. Men
like Henry Rines and William Henry
Eustis in the Tenth congressional dis
trict, and in the state at large men
like J. F. Jacobson, Marcus Johnson,
Frederick C. Stevens and A. A. D.
Rahn.
The democrats of Minnesota are
united for Wilson, but there are Lynch
and anti-Lynch democrats. Fred B.
Lynch is the democratic national com
mitteeman in this state, and many of
his brother democrats are sore at him
because he did not have enough offices
to go around. But all the candidates
for delegates to the St. Louis conven
tion are fighting under the Wilson
banner.
Annexed hereto is a list of the re
publican and democratic candidates
for delegates-at-large, and also the
candidates for delegates from the
Tenth and Sixth congressional dis-

Voters, bear in mind that there are
only four delegates-at-large to be
elected, and two delegates from each
of the congressional districts.
The voter must ask the judges of
eleciion for the ballot of the party
with which he affiliates. If a republi
can ask for a republican ballot, if a
democrat ask for a democratic ballot.
There must be a separate ballot box
at each precinct for the delegate bal
lots.

Mrs. C. F. Lindquist of Gre?nbush
answered the Master's summons Sun
day morning after a lingering illness.
Paralysis was the cause of death.
Funeral services were conducted at
the Greenbush Swedish Lutheran
church yesterday afternoon, and were
largely attended. Rev. M. Peterson
delivered the funeral sermon, taking
for his text, "Prepare to Meet Thy
God." Miss Evelyn Peterson presided
at the organ, and played the funeral
march. Interment was in the church
cemetery.
Deceased was born in Dalsland,
Sweden, December 3, 1851, so at the
time of her demise was 64 years, 2
months and 9 days old. She had
been a resident of Greenbush a number
of years, and was a good Christian, be
ing held in the highest esteem by a
large circle of friends. The husband,
two sons and two daughters survive
her.
Isanti County Teacher Summoned.
Ernest Groth, for several years
principal of the Dalbo graded school,
passed away at his home near Braham
on the 4th inst., at the age of 28
years, 11 months and 2 days. De
ceased was a studious young man, and
had he been spared there is no doubt
but what he would have earned for
himself an enviable place in his
profession. At the time of his demise
he was president of the Isanti County
Teachers' Association, and in 1912 he
was a candidate for superintendent of
schools, receiving a particularly grati
fying vote in the town of Dalbo,
where his labors as an instructor had
won him the confidence and esteem of
the voters to a marked degree. Mr.
Groth was a member of the Masonic
Blue Lodge at Princeton, and was
also a Rose Croix Scottish Rite
Mason.
State Treasurer Smith Resigns.
Walter J. Smith resigned the office
of state treasurer last Friday* and
Governor Burnquist immediately ap
pointed A. C. Gooding, president of the
First National bank of Rochester to
fill the vacancy.
Under the circumstances Mr. Smith
acted wisely in tendering his resigna
tion. Had he not resigned it is doubt
ful if he could be removed save by im
peachment proceedings and that would
have necessitated a special session of
the legislature.
Both Smith and Pickit have been
indicted on several counts by the
Ramsey county grand jury, and both
have entered pleas of not quilty.

P. H. S. WINS TWO
Haughty Sandstone Quint Humbled
by the Basket Ball Tossers of
the Princeton High School.
Princeton Girls Overwhelm the Elk
River MaidensCompany vs.
the Ascension Cubs Next.
For the first time this season the
powerful Sandstone high school bas
ket ball team went down to defeat,
when it made a determined but futile
attempt to withstand the diversified
and speedy attack of the basket ball
tossers representing the local institu
tion of learning, at the Armory last
Friday evening. It was a contest re
plete with thrills, and one that kept the
enthusiasm of the largest crowd of the
season bubbling over at all stages.
Outweighed man for man the locals
won the contest by sheer superiority
of team play, and the cleverness and
rapidity of their work. The final count
was 22 to 17.
The victory over Sandstone was not
the only cause for rejoicing on the
part of Princeton followers of the
great indoor game, however, as the
girl teams of the Elk River and Prince
ton schools staged a contest also, and
the local maids displayed a reversal of
form that was more than gratifying,
overwhelming their opponents by a
count of 14 to 0.
Although rather one-sided the con
test was not without interest, and the
regularity with which the local lassies
propelled the ball through the net was
most pleasing to the spectators, al
though it somewhat disturbed the com
posure of the visiting Misses.
After a few minutes of play it was
very evident that only feature of the
outcome in doubt was the size of
Princeton's lead. The scoring started
when Janice Umbehocker succeeded in
negotiating a basket, and shortly
thereafter Lillian Wetter duplicated
the feat. Myra Dickey then won the
plaudits of those present by negotiat
ing a basket from a most difficult angle
and the scoring for this period ended
when Janice Umbehocker again count
ed with a field goal.
The second half was a repetition of
the first All attempts to score on the
part of the Sherburne county maids
failed, while the Princeton girls exe
cuted formations and passes that were
creditable to say the least. Lillian
Wetter, Myra Dickey and Janice Um
behocker each negotiated a field goal
during this period, making a total of
14 for Princeton to 0 for Elk River.
Princeton had no natural advantage
in size, and the superintendent of the
Sandstone high school refereed, so
there is nothing to detract from the
victory. It is only fair to say that all
of the local girls who participated are
deserving of commendation, but the
brilliant offensive and defensive work
of Misses Umbehocker, Wetter and
Dickey is deserving of especial men
tion. The line-up follows:
PRINCETON Pos. ELK RIVER
Sadie Penhallegon. ,R. F. Hazel Frederickson
Janice Umbehocker L. F. Harriet Bell
Lillian Wetter C. Audri deBooy
Myra Dickey. R. G.. Helen Phimmer
Grace Staples L. G. Zetta Nickerson
*Amta Davis substituted for Grace Staples in
the final period.
The real thriller was the boys' game.
The husky aggregation from the Quar
ry City with several years of experi
ence in the game, and a truly formid
able reputation for this season, were
opponents over which few of the most
sanguine local enthusiasts hoped for
a victory. But with ill concealed ad
miration they watched the Orange and
Black representatives hold the Pine
county athletes to a 10 to 10 tie in the
first half, and score a clean cut victory
in the final period.
The first round was nothing if not
sensational. At no time was the mar
gin between opposing sides greater
than a point or two. Princeton broke
into the score column first when
Raiche made a free throw, and the
lead of the locals was increased when
he followed this a few minutes later
with a field goal. Sandstone then pen
etrated the Princeton defense when
Webb tossed a basket. Jesmer count
ed for Princeton and shortly thereafter
the visitors negotiated a free throw.
Berg took a long shot at the net with
marked success, and Webb for Sand
stone counted again. A field goal for
Jesmer and a free throw for Raiche
completed the scoring for Princeton
in this round, and Maloney for the
visitors evend up the count by negoti
ating two baskets during the final min
utes. Just before time was sounded
Berg and Maloney collided, necessitat
ing a change in the line-up of both
teams. Jesmer went in as guard for
Berg, and Kaiiher took Jesmer's place
at forward. Jarvela took Maloney's
place at forward.
Princeton assumed the offensive at
the outset of the final period, secured
a lead during the first few minutes of
play and held it safely out of reach of
their opponents to the end. Scoring
started when Winsor wafted the
sphere through the net, and then
Raiche added to the joy of local fans by
following suit. The speedy work and
clever team play of the Princeton repr
resentatives featured throughout this
half, and before sharp and piercing
whistle of the time-keeper announced
the end of the period additional goals
were made by Jesmer, Raiche and Kai
iher, and Raiche also negotiated two
free throws. In the meantime the
stone workers were not entirely inac
tive, but they did not penetrate the
Princeton defense any too frequently
and three field goals and a free throw
represented the sum total of their
scoring efforts. The count for this
period was 12 to 7 and the total was
22 to 17.
Hereunder appears the line-up aside
from the changes noted above:

NOTES.
Supt. White of Elk River refereed
the contest, and did it in a manner that
proved entirely satisfactory to both
sides. His decisions were absolutely
impartial, and he followed the play
closely.
Practice with Co. has accustomed
the local high school lads to being op
posed by heavier and more experienced
players, and as a result team work
and speed have been developed to a
marked degree. Considering that the
Sandstone quint is composed of veter
ans, the two forwards having played
five years, and' that all but one of the
Princeton squad were practically with
out experience up to this season, the
showing of the locals is little short of
remarkable.
i!ke rooting squad of the Princeton
high school with new songs and yells
in its repertoire was very much in evi
dence. It cheered the victors lustily
and long.
The girls of Princeton certainly re
deemed themselves, and again demon
strated that their superiors do not
exist.
The high school orchestra rendered
several selections during the evening,
and made a decided hit with those
present.
A reception was tendered the visit
ors at the conclusion of the games, and
a royal good 'time had. Princeton
is becomingly modest when victorious,
and can also accept defeat with good
grace. Both qualities are desirable, al
though it prefers to exercise the first
one.
Co. will again be seen in action to
morrow, Friday, evening when the As
cension Cubs of Minneapolis will in
vade Princeton. Co. has sustained
but one defeat during the 1916 season,
and that at the hands of the Cubs. The
contest was a close one, however, and
the outcome in doubt until the very
end. The militia boys are determined
to win, and we predict that the game
will be a hummer. A dance will be
given at the conclusion of hostilities,
and an orchestra of six pieces will dis
course selections between halves.
Onamia Creamery Elects Officers.
A co-operative creamery for Onamia
is assured. At a recent meeting in
that village officers of the new asso
ciation were elected, and it was de
cided to proceed to build and equip a
creamery immediately. The officers
are: F. P. Michellis, president H. E.
Posely, vice-president N. P. Pearson,
secretary G. H.-Carr, treasurer. Hec
tor VanRessighem, G. H. Baker and R.
E. Cotton were chosen directors. The
association is capitalized at $5,000. It
is estimated that there are 500 milch
cows in the territory to be served by
the creamery, and there is no reason
why the venture should not prove a
success.
A Live Commercial Club.
The Monticello Commercial club is
evidently an organization of "live
wires," and it it is already planning on
getting behind an Independence day
celebration in that village to be held
on July 4 next. The club also intends
to take an active interest in road im
provement in that vicinity and other
matters of local importance. A wide
awake organization of this kind is^of
inestimable value to a community.

THE SPUD SITUATION
Potato Movement is BriskLocal Re-
ceipts and Shipments Heavy
Market Weakens.
Potato Holdings in Minnesota, Wiscon-
sin and Michigan Reported
Short of a Year Ago.
The potato movement has been brisk
in Princeton the past few days, the
moderated temperature having in
creased the receipts materially.
Good prices have been paid. Tri
umphs have been bringing from $1.00
to $1.05 and all other varieties have
netted the farmers from 75c to 80c per
bushel. On Tuesday the outside mar
ket declined, and the local market
weakened accordingly. From 70c to
75c was paid on Tuesday and yester
day, and this morning's quotations ap
pear elsewhere.
The outside demand for potatoes has
been good, and shipments from this
point have been heavy the past week:
On Saturday 32 carloads of spuds left
Princeton on Tuesday 24were shipped,
and today 17 cars will leave this point
a total of 73 since the last issue of
the Union.
Potato receipts have been light at
eastern shipping points, and the Pack
er reports that the tubers are about
out of growers'hands. New York farm
ers who have potatoes are holding
them at $1.00 per bushel. Potatoes
ruled quiet in Chicago last week. Re
ceipts were rather light with only a
moderate demand.
Reports received by the Packer from
points in Minnsota, Wisconsin and
Michigan indicate that potato holdings
in these state are some short of a
year ago. The reports varied, how
ever. Some places the holdings were
normal, and at others only 25% of the
usual amount was on hand, while some
points reported no potatoes at all, or
only enough for home use. Hereunder
appears the Minnesota reports:
Grand Rapids, Minn.There are no
potatoes here but a year ago there
were ten or twenty cars.S. B.
Chisago City, Minn.There are
about 80 cars of potatoes, left at this
station, practically the same as a
year ago. Farmers are holding 85 per
cent of the stock, which is good. Seed
holdings are about like last year, 17
cars, 12 per cent being Triumph and
the balance Rose, Ohios, and Kings.
Lindstrom, Wyoming, Stacy and For
est Lake also have potatoes.B. M. C.
Bemidji, Minn.There are no pota
toes left here a year ago there were
30 cars.M. F. G.
Center City, Minn.Farmers have
been receiving 75c a bushel for Bur
bank potatoes at this point while
they have been selling Triumphs for
$1 at Center City and Lindstrom.

Farmers' Meeting Last Saturday.
Owing to the snow-impeded roads
and lack of proper advertising the
farmers' meeting in the court house
hall was not very largely attended last
Saturday afternoon.
The meeting was called to order by
Mr. H. B. Pratt of Blue Hill, who in a
neat little speech introduced Hon.
Magnus Johnson, member of the state
legislature from the Twenty-sixth dis
trict (Meeker county.)
Mr. Johnson is a fluent and convinc
ing speaker and decidedly aggressive.
His discourse was slightly rambling,
but there was no mistaking his posi
tion on questions that vitally affects
the interests of the farmers. He is an
earnest Equity man and somewhat in
clined, as he said himself, to socialism.
Mr. Johnson is an earnest advocate
of organization and co operation
among farmers. He told of the trials
and tribulations of the farmers of
Meeker county in organizing their var
ious co-operative enterprises and of
how the old line elevator companies
fought them. We made some mis
takes, he said, but in the main our ef
forts were crowned with success.
He also told of the struggles of the
Equity men in North Dakota and the
opposition they encountered. But
things were coming their way in that
state and leading officials and politi
cians had espoused their cause.
In no measured terms he paid his
respects to the line elevator compan
ies, the meat combine that robbed both
the producer and the consumer, and
the Minneapolis Chamber of Com
merce, whose members, he said, were
grain gamblers who dealt largely in
wind.
The speaker also reminded his at
tentive listeners that J. J. Hill had ad
vised them to sell their wheat some
time ago when it was bringing less
than 80 cents per bushel, while now
it was worth from $1.25 to $1.40 per
bushel.
Mr. Johnson urged the farmers to
stand by their own business enterpris-
I
es, and he made an especially strong
appeal for support for the Farmers'
Terminal Packing plant that is soon
to be established at South St.
Paul.
Although some of Mr. Johnson's
statements were a trifle overdrawn on
the whole his talk was fair and inter
esting and was thoroughly enjoyed
and vigorously applauded by the small
but sympathetic audience.
Jurors Drawn.
The regular spring term of the dis
trict court for Mille Lacs county will
open Princeton on March 28, and it
is expected that Judge Parsons of Fer
gus Falls will preside. The grand and

drawn by Clerk of Court King, Sheriff
Shockley and Justice Dickey Monday
afternoon, and appear hereunder:

Ditching Job Let.
The first definite step toward the
construction of county ditch No. 11,
(the Eberhardt ditch) which has occu
pied the attention of the district court
of Mille Lacs county at various terms,
the supreme court of the state, and the
county commissioners on several occa
sions the past few years, was taken
at the office of the county auditor Tues
day, when Auditor Doane and Engineer
Chapman accepted the only bid sub
mitted to them for the construction of
said ditch. The bid was submitted in
person by J. J. Hankenson of the Ajax
Dredge Co., of Glencoe and was for the
entire work as one job. The sum stip
ulated to be paid for the work was
$5,950, while the estimated .cost of the
ditch was $4,594.06.
Active construction work will be
gin about July 1, and the contract en
tered into between the county and con
tractors calls for the completion of
the ditch on or before December 1,
next. A small floating dredge will be
used on the main ditch and that part
of the lateral below the railway, while
that part of the lateral above the rail
way will be dug by hand or other
means.
The indications are that before 1917
the ditch will exist in reality as well
as on paper.
Schall Club at Onamia.
A club has been organized at
Onamia in the interest of Congress
man Thomas D. Schall with 111 mem
bers. G. H. Carr is president and C.
H. Hillemann is secretary of the
club.
At the last meeting of the club Mr.
Schall's action in sending out circu-*
lars to ascertain the views of his con
stitutents on important public ques
tions was indorsed.
Mr. Schall is making a fine record
in congress, and he seems to be es
pecially anxious to get the views of
his constituents and served them to the
best of his ability, and although he is
blind, with the assistance of his ex
cellent little wife, he is serving them
well and faithfully.
The Union supported Mr. Schall in
his contest two years ago, and it was
about the only newspaper in the dis
trict friendly to him. And at the
present writing we know of no reason
why the Union cannot cheerfully, with
out money and without price, support
him for re-election.
