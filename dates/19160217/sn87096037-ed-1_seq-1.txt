Dear Sir:
I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter
with-listings of lands belonging to First Na
tional Bank of Hope. We also have l'eceived
exclusive contracts on the lands belonging to
Mr. J. D. Brown. As we do not accept any
but exclusive listings, I believe it fair that you
should know and be able to explain to land
owners desiring to sell and who are willing to
give us the exclusive sale of their land, just
what they may reasonably expect in the way.
of service for the consideration of the ex
clusive handling of their property 'an we know
that there are only few Companies who de
mand this. In the first place, we desire that
you be perfectly frank and do not hesitate to
refuse to list land that you believe is too high
in price or where terms are such that you
think we cannot sell it. We do not adopt this
policy because we feel independent or anything
of that sort but simply because we want to
give those that trust us with the sale of their
property, the service that they are entitled to.
If v/e accept lands that are too high in price
and terms, we could not give them the positive
assurance of selling that we will be expected
to give when accepting a farm.
You have worked with me long enough to
know that the man that I admire is the man
that keeps his word good and backs up his
statements with actual facts and deeds. When
you tell a man that you firmly believe you can
sell his farm, we must make good. Work on it,
show it, and sell it.
As to our ability to sell, and our opportunities
for getting purchasers, I wish to make this
positive statement. I have been in the land
business for about fifteen years and the com
pany that I have lately been connected with
has done around fifteen million dollars worth of
business during that time. 1 have never
known a time at this season of the year when
I have felt that we had as strong a line up and
as good an organization for the procuring of
purchasers as we have secured for 1916. These
men are all under contracts to give their whole
time and attention to this work and in most
every instance, each man has his own automo
bile to travel with.
It has been our policy from the first to get
the very best and most experienced men in the
immigration business and I believe there is no
company doing business today that can show
a better line of business getters. We have
men that have a record of sales amounting to
8,00ft acres last year, and everybody knows last

year was a bad year for land selling. With
this force of experts, together with the fact
that our financial credit is well enough estab
lished to enable us to handle most any kind of
a trade either lurge or small, I feel justified
in saying that I would be very much disap
pointed if our salesmen run less than 20,000
acres for 1916.
We have already a number inquiries and a
great many prospects waiting for advice from
us as to the best time to come.
It is not my intention to make you feel
overconfident but I surely never felt more cer
tain of my position. I am writing this letter so
that you may know about how many acres of
land it will be necessary to procure. We want
at least 50,000 acres located in the following
counties: Steele, Grigg3, Barnes, Cass and
Traill. It has been my experience that it is
almost necessary to have at least two and a half
times as many acres as you expect to sell. In
fact, a well organized Land Company is simi
lar to a department store. They have to have
all kinds and sizes, as no two buyers are just
alike. The demand for the past two years has
been for small improved farms, 80-160-320-640
acres. This comes from a class of home
seekers who want good buildings and improve
ments. The non-resident speculator has been
practically out of the market, much to the dis
appointment of the Land Companies as they
are easier sold and not so critical.
The lands owned outright by this Company
at the present time, amount to about 2,000
acres. The lands belonging to the First Na
tional Bank, about 2,000 acres, and the land3
of Mr. J. D. Brown, amount to around 2,500
acres. This will give you an idea of about
what we yet need to procure.
As you are aware, we have two automobiles
now ready to send to Hope and are arranging
for the purchase of others as they are needed.
I believe that large seven passenger cars will
be the practical car to buy as we can meet and
deliver men at Fargo, Hillsboro, Valley City or
most any point in the territory. I have made
arrangements with the Great Northern Rail
way to stop train No. 3 for us at Bedford
whenever we desire it so that this will help
out considerably.
I would suggest running an announcement in
the Hope Pioneer, Hillsboro Banner, Fargo
Forum, Fargo Courier-News, Luverne Ledger
and Cooperstown Sentinel-Courier, advising the
public that we will open our office at Hope, about
March 1st. I have no objection to your publish
ing thiB letter, if you so desire.
Yours Truly,

The Player Piano that Is All but Human
You really play it through the pedals
in the tame sense that an artist plays it
through the keys. Just as he secures his
effeets merely by giving his musical feel

does one at the Manualo secure equally
intimate effects merely through the in
stinctive expression of his musical impul

controlled from the pedals as from the
the keys. It is a piano to you who cannot
play by hand the same as to those whose
fingers have years of training.
