A Weekly Keview
Of The Great War
Increased activity is reported
fiom several of t'.ie European
war fronts, notable from France
and along the lines wh^re Russians
and Teutons are facing
each other in Galicia.
In the Champagne a4 French
attack was carried through after
prolonged artillery preparation
and according to Paris, some 800
yards of German trenches were
taken. Berlin concedes a French
Again in this territory, northeast
of Massiges, placing the extent
cf the captured positions at 200
yards.
Petrograd unofficially reports
the Teutonic forces on the defensive
on the three important
streams along which much of
the recent fighting in Galicia
and nearby froot^has been conducted?the
Serefch, the Pruth
and the Dniester. Several
breaches are declared to have
I been made in the lines of the
Teutonic allies. While admiti
ting that the immediate stragetk
ic results so far have not been
A important, the Petrograd advices
B record a belief that the Russian
offensive has at least relieved
pressure on the entente forces
H along other fronts.
In Asia there are three dis|B
tir.ct but interrelated campaigns
in the region between the Caucasiao
mountains and the Persian
Gulf. On the north the
Russians are fighting the Turks
about Erzeruin. Ou the south
the British are trying to advance
up the Tigris River. On
the east the Russians are invading
Persia from the Caspian 6ea.
In tlie fit st campaign the Russians
are progressing famously,
if we may credit the Petrograd
reports, which are, indeed, but
faintly* coutradicted from Constantinople.
They claim that
the Turks were driven back from
the Caucasian border with such
slaughter and. confusion that
they failed even to rally behind
the line of fortifications which
had been prepared for the defense
of Erzerum and which extend
for mote than a dozen miles
to the north of that city. It is
rumored that the Turks have
evacuated Erzerum. This, however,
is too incredible to oe ac
c.pted without confirmation, for
Erzerum occupies a strong and
easily defensible position among
the mountains and should be ca
pable of standing long, Isiege. In
1878 an English officer who hap
pened to be in the city at the
time it was attacked assumed
command and held it against the
Russians till the end of the war.
Thej Turks are renowned for
stubborn resistance when besieg^
ed and their defense of Oallipoli
shove that they have not lost
their former ability. The Russians
launched their first attack
at Erzerum a year ago last October,
so the lurks and their Ger !
man allies have had abundant'
time to put the city in a state of
defense. If then Erzerum surrenders
shortly it will mean a
very complete collapse of Ottoman
courage. It. is much more
nrobable that the Russians will
be content with investing the
city and then pass on as they
did in the cape of Przomysl in
their Galician campaign. The
reports of their advance to the
north and south of Erzerum indicates
that this is what they are
doing.
the British on the Tigris
we hear littlo, but general Town- i
phend's force at Kut-el-Amara is
still holding out and General
Aylmers relief expedition is reported
to bo making progress up
the rivers. The "rivers of BabyJon"
came to the aid of the English
in their distress. The flooding
of the Tigris filled the Turk
ish entrenchments at Kuc and
drove out their defenders. When
the British came to examine tl e
works they found twenty-two
^ rows of immensely deep trenches
with miles of communicating
trenches. ^
In Persia the^ Russians! have
southeast of llamadan, whereas
they must go southwest if they
are to give any aid to the Eng
lish on the Tigris. Their advance
in this, direction appears
to be barred by a force of Persian
tribesmen, said to number
16,000, under Qerman officers,
between them and Kermanshah.

A Needy Case.
Our attention has been called
to the condition of a certain
family in Chesterfield county
whose plight is desperate.
The father is an inmate of the i
insane asylum and the mother is
said to be net much better
equipped mentally than the
father. Perhaps not much sympathy
need be wasted on the
older people, but there are seven
children. One of them, the oldest,
a lad of fourteen, has fortunately
found a home in the
State reformatory. The other
six, we are told, are living in a
wretchedly filthy condition, destitute
of food and clothing.
Here is an excellent opportunity
for some good people to
do a little Christian work without.

The Perils of Pauline
The sixth episode of the Perils
of Pauline to be shown at the
AinusU Theatre next Tuesday
evening, will be the greatest
thriller of them all, scenes in
which the actors are at times in
actual peril.
The villians, foiled in all previous
attempts on the life of the
beautiful heroine, succeed in
getting her onto the grounds
where a balloon ascention is to
be made. Pauline, unsuspectingly
enters the basket of the
baloon. An accident causes the
release of the balloon?then the
excitement begins.
Some genuine thrills await the
spectators next Tuesday night.

Anson Regulates Width of Tires
At their meetirfg Monday the
Commissioners passed an order
regulating the width of wagon
tires and size of loads. It provides
that not more than 2,000
pounds may be carried on wagons
with tires of 2 inched and
1 >89; from 2 to 2% inches 12,600
| pounds; 8 inches or more, 6,000
, lbs. This applies to roads workj
ed in whole or part by the county
funds. Notice is given that
persons buying new wagons with
tiies less than 2% inches, do so
at their peril. A recent act of
the Legislature gives this power
to County Commissioners.?

Suggestions on The
Use of Fertilizers <
Owing to the prohibitive price 1
of potash and the very high price
of all other fertilizer ingredi- 1
ente farmers are facing a very J
trying situation this spring.
The^State Agriculture Depart- {
ment is doing some praiseworthy 1
work in an endeavor to place be- (
fore the farmers all the informa- 1
tion on the subject that is avail- '
able. 1
Last week we published part 1
of Bulletin No. 17, dealing with 1
the fertilizer situation. The (
fallowing is taken from the same 1
bulletin. These two articles
merit (the closest attention of 1
every farmer in the county :
There are three fertilizing ma- 1
terials of which our farmers can i
make good u*e on land that is iu 8
a comparatively poor state of c
cultivation and, unfortunately '
this includes a large percentage 1
of the cultivated lands in this
State. These materials are: acid
phosphate, cottonseed meal, and
nitrate of soda. It is true that 1
the prices of these materials
have advanced, but not much
more than has been the advance
in the price of cottonseed. It is
a good plan for the farmer to return
the money received for his
cottonseed to his land thro ugh
the purchase of fertilizer and to ~
supplement this as much as he c
feels able. The rate of exchange 8
of seed for meal is better than ^
usual, nitrate of soda has ad *
vanced about 60 percent in price,
and acid phosphate about 80 per- ('
cent, while cottonseed has advanced
more than 50 percent ov- F
er prices that forme.ly prevail- ?
ed. From the above informa- ^
ti ?n we see that our cottonseed
will purchase almost as much
fertilizer as usual.
Recommendations for Piedmont
Soils: In the Piedmont re- F
gion on poor land, nitrogen is 1<
the first Limiting factor and e
phosphorus the second limiting s<
factor. In this section, on fer
tile soil, phosphorus is the first a
limiting factor and nitrogen is a
the second limiting factor. t<
Therefore, using the three sourcesjof
plant food already discuss- 8<
ed, we should suggest the following
applications and formulas, c
which may be varied within cer- tain
limits to meet local condi- ~
tions.
(I) For poor to ordinary land,
an application per acre of from
200 to 100 pounds of a mixture
composed of 1,000 pounds of 10
percent acid phosphate. 800
pounds of 7 percent cottonseed
meal, and 200 pounds of nitrate
of soda is recommended. This
mixture should analyze 8 8 percent
available phosphoric acid,
nitrogen equivalent to 4.6 percent
ammonia, and enough potash
will be furnished by the cottonseed
meal to give the mixture
a content of 0 6 percent
potash.
(2) On fertile soil, an applies- |
tion pei acre of from 800 to 600
pounds of a mixture composed of
1,200 pounds of 16 percent acid r
phosphate, 660 pounds of cotton- ;
seed meal, and 160 pounds of ni
trate of soda should give good
results. This mixture should |
analyze 10.26 percent phosphroic j
acid, nitrogen equivalent to 8 63
percent amonia, and 0 40 percent
potash.
Recommendations for Coastal
Plain Soils: For the coastal region
we recommend that onleached
wood ashes be conserved

"Prepare For Weevil"
t Says Mr. Elliott
- iMr. W. R. Elliott, district
!? demonstration agent f'om Wins^
boro, has been making some excellent
speeches in the county
e this week. The burden of his
* theme is preparation for the
8 reception of the boll weevil,
e "We estimate the pest will be
j here in three years, according to
A. A. - - f i-- 1 1
^ ius present, rate 01 travel, tnougn
it is possible that gulf storms
or other conditions may greatly
t hasten its arrival. And when it
? conies it is going to spell disas8
ter to those notpreparee to fight
> it."
Mr. Elliott is in no sense a
8 pessimist, but he is thoroughly
c familiar with the havoc wrought
r by the weevil in other States
and he seems very anxious that
i South Carolinians should take
r advantage of the experience of
" less fortunate States, and pret
pare.
"Every farmer in this county
' should.begin right now to select
5 cotton seed of a early fruiting
variety, should cut down his cotk
ton acreage and begin raising
I more stock and foodstuffs," said
> he.
? The Advertiser's representa"
tive then asked him what he
' thought of the partridge as an
> ally to the farmer in the des'
truction of the weevil.
His reply was that the value
of this bird to the farmer in a
> weevil infested district could not
be estimated. "One partridge
i will destroy in a single day an
unbelievable number ot insects.
I am gratified to notice that
' many of your farmers have
posted their land against hunting.
This is fine. It is my firm
conviction that not another bird
should bf killed in this State
1 during the next five years.
"If you cannot get a law closing
the season and thus protect
ing the birds in this county the
next best thing would be for
every farmer who values his future
prosperity to post his land
and thus allow the birds to multiply
on his place."
Gapt. Thrower for R. R. Com'r.

Thrower, of Cheraw, have induced

More Liqfuor Laws
From Golumb:n
One of the most important
pieces of legislation passed by
the General Assembly and tint
13 now law is the bill to make i:
mandatory on Judges to impose
chaingang sentences on those
convicted of selling whisko; .
The law provides for sentene .
of six months to two years f' r
first violation of the law an I
sentences of two years to live
years for second violations < :'
the law. There is a proviso that
the Judge may, in his discreti ,
suspend during good behavior all
of the sentence tor first violation
but 00 days on the chaingang
and all but GO days on chaingang
for second conviction but in no
case can the judge impose a fine
or in any way let the convicted
escape a chaingang sentence of
a, least 30 days for first offense
and GO days for second offense.
It is believed this law which imposes
hard labor on those convicted
will go a long way toward
making white men quit selling
liquor, for a sentence on tl
chaingang will be their portion
if they do not take timely warning.
