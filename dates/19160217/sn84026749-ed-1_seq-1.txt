AT ERZERUM
Joyful Thronps Parade Streets

ACCLAjM NICHOLAS A HERO
Capture of Fortress Believed to
Prscaoe Onward Sweep of
Cnfjre Line.
LONDON, 'Feb. 17-Betwecn
JW.000 and 100,000 Turkish
troops and large, numbers of
guns were captured by the
Grand Duke's forces when they
entered the Turkish fortress of
Erzerum, according to unof
ficial reports receired from
Petrograd this afternoon. '
PETROGRAD, Feb. 17. The greatest
demonstration since the capture or
Prsemysl occurred In Petrograd today,
(following confirmation of reports of the
capture of Erzerum.
Great crowds marched through tho
streets, waving tho Russian colors and
chanting hymns.. Thousands attended
To Deum servloca In the great Katan
Cathedral, while other thousands, stand
ing outside In the snow, offered up pray
ers for the Grand Duke Nicholas, again
the natonal hero.
Tho conquest of Erserum, the first Im
portant Russlan'vlctory since tho retreat
from the Carpathians began nearly a
year ago, has' stirred the Russian. Peo
plo to great depths of patriotism. The
newspapers today declare the grand
duke's trlUmph only 'the prelude to
greater victories that will carry the
Czar's armies sweeping back, through
Poland and Galicla before summer.
Turks Jn Flight.
Because tbtneagec communication
Wlth;the.CaueasUfegon, details of tho
final fighting- preceding tho fall of . the
gwaVTurklsV'foHresa are lacking here.
One. dispatch said that the Turks were
fleeing westward, abandoning' part of
th'elr artillery, This Is taken to mean
that the larger part of the Turkish gar
rison, variously estimated at from 80,000
to 160,000 men, has escaped.
The capture of Erzerum means the
collapse of all Turkish plana of conquest
of Persia, military men here believe, and
possibly will force the Turks to aban
don their plans to Invade Egypt.
Blocks Suez Drive.
Wlth'n British army, soon to be
heavily rc-epforced. fighting only U0
mites from Bagdad, and the grand
duke's forces moving westward through
Armenia In a spring drive. It is be
lieved here that Knead Paaha will not
risk sending large forces to the Sues.
Cossack squadrons. It is assumed, are
pressing the retreating Turks, who must
continue their fight for several days be
fore arriving at anybase whero they
can maka a stand.
The grand duko't main forces prob
ably will be halted within tho walls of
Erzerum for several days, recuperating
from tho hardships of tho campaigns In
the anows.
.Grand Duke Nicholas telegraphed to
the Empe'ror as follows:
"God has grafted to the brave troops
of the army of the Caucasus such great
help that Erzerum has been taken after
rive days of unprecedented assaults. I
am Inexpressibly happy to, announce
this victory to your imperial majesty."
Of Strategic Value.
Unofficial reports early In the present
month said that Field Marshal von der
Colts, with SOiOOO men, was besieged In
the city with provisions for only a fort
night. The capture of Turkey's northern
stronghold Is considered of great strate
gic Importance. From Erzerum radiate
roods leading In all directions. Over
those to the southwest and south It will
be possible for the Russians now to
fight their way toward their compa
triots operating against the Persians
and Turks In northwest and west Per
sia, or 'Proceed south toward Bagdad,
to the relief of the British, bottled up In
Kut-el-Amara, on the Tigris, southeast
of Bagdad,
Controlling the roads through Arme
nia, with access to Treblzond, Tabriz,
and Mesopotamia, tho capture Is calcu
lated to have Immense strategic Impor
tance in the Russian campaign in the
Caucasus. And it will Indirectly affect
the Balkan campaign by relieving the
pressure on tho elites at Salonlki.

Developments of Last' Few
Days Indioate Roosevelt
"Has Come Back."
l
Rounding un the big political develop
ments of the past tortv-elght hour, the
Republican "old guard" of New York
are now declared to be engineering a
movement to head off a Roosevelt boom
In the Empire State by indorsing Elihu
Root
There Is" every outward evidence to
day of such a plan. Three of the tfcle-gates-at-large
to the' Chicago conven
tion met In New York last night to
put forward the name of Root. Action
was deferred because of the absence of
Governor Whitman. He. however, al
ready to eenwnltted to the Hughes boom.
Alarmed At T. R. Sentiment.
After a survey of New York political
conditions, a well-informed Democratic
official reached Washington today from
the camp of the party's enemy. He
aid:
"Tne 'old gaard' In New York are
alarmed over the growing sentiment for
Roosevelt They don't want - either
Roosevelt or Hughes, but are afraid
they, will have to take the cnldnel on
the theory that, 'he'll win,' "
Developments during the past few
days all have had a Roosevettlan tinge.
A resume of O. O. P. happenings shows
this: '
The name of Colonel Roosevelt was
greeted with great applause when It
was mentioned Incidentally last night
at a banquet of. the Union League Club
in Phtlat)eltJhii This famous club Is a
stralghtout Republican organisation.
The mention of names ot other Republicans-Root

convention. tr. Root deltberatelf.vdef
leted an Intended, complimentary rtlj
erence to Colonel Roosevelt This refer
ence was included In tho advance copies
of the speech, but was never spoken.
Newspapers were Instructed to "kill It"
Significance is attached today to this
excision. The bitter opposition ot
Barnes to Roosevelt may have had a
bearing on Mr. Root's notion.

ON CHARACTER OF
BRANDBS ARE GIVEN
Moorefield Storey Calls Him
"Untrustworthy," Although
"Able and Energetic."
WHIPPLE SAYS HE'S HONEST
Charge Also Made At Hearing
That Appointee Tried to
Wreck New England Road.
Two of New England's foremost at
torneys today presented a widely di
vergent views of tho character of
Louis D. Rrandels at the hearing be
fore the Senate committee upon, his
fitness- to sit on the Vnlted States
Supreme Ccurt bench, s
Moorefield Storey, of Boston,
charged Mr. Brandels with having
tried to wreck tho old Now York and
New England railroad. He further
charged him with appearing; in the
case In the name of -r client who had
been paid to -permit his name to be
used.
Mr. Storey's Opinion.
Mr. Storey; gave this estimate or his
own opinion of Mr. Brandels, and said
It 'coincided with the estimation In
which he is held among most Boston
attorneys.
"An able lawyer, very energetic, ana
ruthless In attainment not scrupulous
in the method he adopts, and Untrust
worthy." Bherman I.. Whipple, another promi
nent Boston attorney, gave this con
trasting picture of Mr Brandelsi
"As a lawyer, able .and honest: as a
man, conscientious qkd high-minded."
Mr. Storey said he did not believe Mr.
Brandels had set out to wreck tho New
York. New Haven, and Hartford roaa,
as he .had tho New Hhgland road. He
said the New Haven road at tlnto hoa
been "reckless In expenditure," and tllat
Air. Brandels had brought these facia
before the public. V' .
Henator Walsh inquired whether per
,onSi of foremost social and political
importance In Now Ungland were not
connected with the New Haven rail-
roaa. -Mr, Storey said ttiat was true..
'-iU
woud naturally not be In high ruvot
with wwBO-of-)-otircltliens, would hir
asked Senator Walsh.. - .
Mr. Storey replied that he did not
think that this fact had anything to
do with the estimate placed on Mr.
Brandels' character. '
Employed By Magazine.
Mr. Storey criticised Brandels for
appearing- beforo a committee of the
legislature In opposition' to the New
Haven railroad's methods, because, he
said, he had been engaged by a maga
zine to do to.
"What is wrong about thatr asked
Senator Walsh.
"Well. If It had been known he
merely was representing a periodical,
his attempt would not have carried
such great weight" replied Mr. Storey.
Senator Walsh attempted to show
that-most of the opposition against Mr.
"Brandels came from the older lawyers
in Boston. '
The young men who don't know htm
are with Mm." replied Mr. Storey. "The
young men who do, oppose hmV
The testimony of Mr. Whipple was
principally concerned with tho Jamea
T. Lennox case, in connection with
which the Rev. P. J. Lennos, of Cath
olic University, will later appear. Mr.
Whipple also touched upon the War
ren case, which was extensively com
mented upon by Horace Bailey, anotner
BQston attorney, when he appeared te-fore-the
committee,
CroM-Examlned For Committee.
George W. Anderson, United States
District Attorney for Boston, cross-examined
both witnesses at the request
of the committee. Mr. Andersen Intro
due3 Mr. Storey as one of the. most
eminent men of tho New England bar.
and paid a 11 ko tribute to Mr. Whlpplo
when he appeared.
Mr. Btorey said he believed Mr. Bar
ion's charges regarding Brandbls' con
nection wnn me .ow jcnuiarra roan.
were true. Mr. Storey said n formerly
was counsel for the New York, New
Haven and Hartford railroad. He told
how in 1&! Mr. Brandels had brought
n, series of suits against the old NVw
York nnd New England railroad. Tho
fight against tho railroad was con
ducted in three States Massachusetts,
Rhode island and Connecticut Sir.
Brandels appeared as attorney for a
Mr. Goldsmith, a liquor dealer in Bos
ton. Upon Inquiry. Mr. Btorey stted.
it turned out that Mr. GmdKmlth owned
only W.000 worth- of stock and was not
able to employ counsel for such an ex
tensive attack upon the road.
. Sir. Storey alleged that it had been
brought out that Goldsmith was paid
to allow his nsmo to be used, nnd that
Mr. Brandels had never made anv
charges for services to him. but had
collected his fees from certain persons
In New York. Mr. Storey did nnt say
who these persons were, but added:
"They may hav been persons acting
Individually or they may have been
connected with the New Haven road."
Question of Numbers.
In connection with the protest against
Mr. Brandels' confirmation, signed by
President Lowell, of Harvard, and a
group of Boston lawyers, an extended
discussion took place as to how many
Attorneys thero nro in Boston.
On cross-examination, Mr. v Anderson
brought out that Mr. Brandels had been
for many years on the visiting com
mittee at Harvard, that Harvard had
given him an honorary A. M. degree in
1903. and later he had been madn an
honorary member of the Harvard chap
ter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society,
Mr. Whipple then began hls.testlmony
regarding the Wnrren will case. Ho
went over much of the same ground
covered by Mr. Bailey.

Get Job For Him.
General denial of the charges
brought against htm was entered by
Chairman R. O. Smith, of the Excise
Board, today when the. Inquiry Into

to some of the statements made by
the presldont of, the. -Anti-Saloon
Leaguo and ministers who opposed
his confirmation at the hearings Mon
day and Tuesday. .
No Liquor Connections.
Replying to questions by Senator
Phelan, General Smith said he had no
connection with any liquor Interests;
that ho and the other members of
the board were trying to administer
the excise laws,, a difficult task, he
said, without fear, favoritism or par
tiality, and that he knew of no cases
In which a liquor license had been
granted In violation of the law.
In reply to other questions he said
If it came to his notice that a llcento
had been granted in violation of the
law he would take proper steps to
"have It revoked.

Desk With Hearings.
The other half dealt' with, allegations
maMe since the hearings as, to his fitness
for reapolntment began. General
Smith said the protestanU against his
confirmation and opponents of, the board
had the' wrong conception as to the
measurement of distances between
places of worship and saloons. He said
the right angular measurement was
adopted by the board In compliance
with orders Issued by the Commission
ers and In accordance with the traffic
laws.
"Would a man be subject to arrest for
walking between two points' as tho bird

General Smith replied that penalties

TOANSWERU.S
At his conference with Count von
Bernstorff, the Secretary, who had sent
for the ambassador, informed him that
the United States could not In the light
of tho new German submarine decree,
accept any settlement of the Lusltanla
controversy as satisfactory which did
not explicitly set forth that Germany's
new submarine warftre will not Involve
unwarden of attacks on passenger ves
sels, Bcrnstorff Exploclt.
Count von Bernstorff was equally ex
plicit Though explaining that he would
not speak finally without further in
structions from his Government, he felt
certain that Germany would not agree
to any such proposition in light of what
It now knows regarding British inten
tions. Great Britain, the ambassador
pointed out, has recently Issued secret
orders to its merchant craft, to arm and
to attack enemy submarines on sight
As far as Germany Is advised, these
Instructions aply to passenger as well
as freight steamers. This burden, he
declared, rested with Great Britain .to
show that passenger vessels were Ex
cepted from such orders. Until she does
show this, he insisted, Germany, on the
basis of what Mr. Lansing has himself
arguel in his modus Vivendi propos&Ui
to the entente powers, must regard arm
ed passenger ships as auxiliary crui
sers. Secretary Lansing, hnwevo", was
quick to sot tho ambassador right con
cerning these proposals to the entept"
fiowers. What he was contending tn
hose proposals, bo told tho Ambaia
dor, was not that the allies wern n,ot
privileged under lntcmntio.nal law to
arm their ship for defense, but that
such armement In the light of sub.
marine warfare was unreasonable.
The United States, lie Insisted, had
never Intended throwing over Inter
national law In the midst of tha war
unless all Interested parties should
agree. As thene had heen manifested
on the part of the allies a disposition
not to agree, tho United States, ho de
clared, won prepared to stand by tha
law as It now is, and to hold Ger
many to an nccnuntlm; if, by reason of '
unwarned attacks on- passemjer vss-.

German Shipper Fears

"A break between Germany andi
America," the shipping head was quoted
as saying, "would place all American
money ppd ammunition at the disooy.t
