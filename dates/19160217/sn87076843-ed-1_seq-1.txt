WAR UPON PAIN!
Pnin is a visitor to every home nnd
usually it comes quite unexpectedly.
But you arc prepared for every emer
gency if you keep a small bottle of
Sloan's Liniment handy. It is the
greatest pain killer ever discovered.
Simply laid on the skin no rubbing
required it drives the pain away. It
is really wonderful.
Mervin H. Soister, Berkeley, Cal.,
writes: f'Last Saturday, after tramp
ing around the Panama Exposition'
with wet feet, 1 came home with my
neck so stiff that I couldn't turn. I
applied Sloan's Liniment freely and
went to bed. To my surprise, next
morning the stiffness had almost dis
appeared, four hours after the second
application I was as good as new."

Prominent Citizen to Be Tried for
Stealing Rooster.
Mrs. Mariah Jones, who lives not
far from town, owned a valuable
pure-bred Plymouth Rock rooster,
the pet of her flock of chickens,
but when Mrs. Jones failed to hear
his welcome call at daybreak re
cently, she hustled out to learn the
cause and discovered her pet was
misiing.
She made inquiry and learned
that the day previous a certain
dignified gentleman of Perrysburg
had drivqn past her place and had
stopped' to admire the bird. A
little detective work soon located
the barnyard favorite in the pos
session of the aforesaid dignified
gentleman, and upon this incident
hangs the tale that will be thresh
ed out in a special session of court,
which will occur at the town hall
on Tuesday evening, February 22,
1916, and everybody is invited to
attend and hear the trial.
G. B. Lownsbury will represent
Mrs. Jones as Complainant.
The event will be known as the
"Mock Trial, or Who Stole the
Rooster?" and will be given by the
Perrysburg Civic Association, a
large number oi tin members ap
pearing in the east.
The story is written by Col.
Taylor and has been presented in
hundreds of towns throughout the
United States, and was given in
Jiowiing ureen a lew years ago
with court house attaches and
leading attorneys and citizens tak

Col. Taylor will be here to con

Greenhalgh will act as attorney for

HEW.SCHOOL HOUSE,
To the Voters of Perrysburg . School
District:
In the near future there -will be, sub
mitted for your consideration a bond
issue for the purpose of erecting an
addition to our school building. About
one year ago this question Avas sub
mitted to you and A'ao defeated, part
ly because of false stories in regard to
ceituin equipment, and partly because
it was not known that the election was
to be held. At this time Ave Avant every
one to know exactly what he is voting
for. Every person in the district
knows that Ave rtod more school room,
r that our building is overcroAvded and
for several years it has been necessary
to hold school at other places than our
own building. This is a condition
Avhich avo all deplore, but Avhich Ave are
unable to remedy Avith our present
building. Perrysburg has a larger tax
valuation than any village in Wood
county and avc will be able to get
enough money to run the schools very
easily. Our school is no Avorse off than
practically every school in the state in
1 this regard, but the question of getting
' more money for school purposes Avill
! be taken up by the legislature very
soon. It is possible to vote money to
1 build a neAv school, but it cannot bo
, voted to run them. Every parent OAves
their children an education and should
provide them with it. If Perrysburg
Retb the addition avo will be able to
i,ave an a grade high school and a
graduate from it will be able to enter
such universities as Michigan without
turtner examination, Avhich would fie
sometning to be proud of. Ferryefiurg
