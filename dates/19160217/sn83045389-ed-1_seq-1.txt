it is felt.
Tho annual domestic consumption!
heiv is about !Oo.,>00.000 pouttils. while
the amount re-exported in manufactured

The consumption of tobacco in Great'
I bit a in has increased greatly during
the past f.-w years, and importers have
been bringing in huge amounts, and
until recently storage space lias been
at a pr. minm. The government is uell
a w.i re of this condition. so. despite th>?
powerful financial interests involved in

The bulky nature of tobacco made it
a natural object of restriction, and it
is hardly likely !o protU much by (iie
license loophole, as all the big tobacco
ports are also whea t -shipping places,
and wlu-at will always be favored.
The Imperial Tobacco Company, the'
largest buyer of American tobacco, is
not expected to cease bu.\ ing because
of the prohibition, as it is understood j
it feels it necessary to sustain 'lie I
American market, and. therefore, prob
ably will store its purchases in the
1 nited Stale* This plan, however,!
may be upst t, as there is some proha-;
bility that the government will scon!
forbid ihe transfer of money to pay'
for the commodities on the prohibited ?

prohibited list do not show an\ meat'

importations of paper have been ir.ade'
froni America.
The. furthei extension of the pro

If fruit he prohibited, the United,

More than I (50.000 Turkish troops
were locked up In Krzeruiu with the
investment <>f the fortress, according
to all dispatches. Recently the num
ber had been reduced to about SO,000.
Two noted Oerman leaders. Field Mar
shals von der tJoltz and Rimon von
Sanders. have recently been reported at
Krzertiin. It is not yet known whether
they escaped.
The Russian campaign was un
paralleled in military history. The ad - .
vanee was pressed across a bleak and
rumjed coiintry, over mountains and
through narrow detlles in Antic cold.
Russian oiticial reports statu that at
places the soldiers fought their advance
through snow fifteen feet deep.
The grand duke's message was re
ceived shortly after a report from his
army headquarters that nine of the
defending forts of Krzerum had been
taken with the bayonet. The Russian
soldiers swept up tlio mountainsides
and swarmed through caps made by the
heavy puns.
(?rand Duke Nicholas took command
011 the Russian southern front less than
live months ago. Immediately the Rus
sian forces, which had been inactive,
began to develop the offensive which
has resulted in the fall of Krxerutn.
The grand duke is considered by
military experts to be one of the
greatest strategists developed by the
war. I"rom the outbreak of hostilities
until early in September last ho was
commander-in-chief of the Russian
armies, lie directed the masterly re
treat of the harassed Russians during
the A ust ro-CSerman offensive of last
summer, twice saving his armies front
what threatened to bo fatal traps.
