j speech by William .loynson Hicks,
: unionist, who recalled Winston Spen
cer Churchill's slatem.ent of March,
1911, that Kngkiiid was to have a
fleet of airships and that one of the
Zeppelin type had been laid down.
( liuicl.ill Is Flamed.
"Mr. Churchill" continued thn
speaker, "said we had Mult or were
building fifteen airships. Where are
they'.'"
Towards the close of his speech, Mr.
Joynson-Hieks reverted to this saim
subject, remarking: "1 have left out
the possibility of our defending- our
selves from an air raid by means of
airships of the Zeppelin type because,
we have not got any. Regarding
this lack, a heavy responsibility rents
on the gentleman who was first lord
of the admiralty some time ago." The
debate on air defense was introduce 1
by Mr. Joynson-Hicks in moving- an
amendment to the address from the
throne, regretting "that no proposal
has been made therein for placing'
thn air service of the country on a
firmer and stronger basis."
Complete DcI'ciim' Impossible.
At the (lose of the day's debate,
Mr. Joynson-IflckH consented to with
draw hi.s amendment on the under
standing that further opportunity
would be offered for debate later in
the session.
Mr. Tennnnt, in behalf of the war
office, after outlining a new scheme
for the co-ordination of the army,
navy and munitions departments in
the work of air defense, closed with;
the statement: '
"While we have made strides: in'
providing proper erpilpnu'iit and de.
lispatch i fense for the arsenals and vulnerable
points of the cnimlrv, the safety of
every part of tho I'nited Kingdom

ommendin Mr. Knot, as New
favorite son for the presidency was
defeated in the coinmiitee on resolu
tions anl a counter-resolution that no
presidential c.uiilul.ite be endorsed
, was passed uuaiUmnusly.
' Th,. principal ground' upon which
the opponents u' the Root I e'.olut b.n
fougut was that tin endorsement of
Mr. Foot, would preclude the possi
bility of New York putting forward

i The big battle ill ihe convetilion
was fought out between the "old line"
organization under the leadership of
William Faiiies and the suppniiirs
of Governor Whitman.
The iiucstion of endorsement ended
in a compromise by which two reso
lutions were presented, one deallliM
exclusively with national affairs and
the other "coniinendim?" Governor
Whitman's conduct of the- slate ad
ministration. This partial victory of
the governor was offset by a complete
defeat on tin- iiiesllon of the national
delegates. Tile Whitman force had
united all their strength in an effort
to nominal.. David Jayno Hill, of
i Rochester, as one of the "big four."
The Fames faction declared them
selves opposed to Mr. Hill and pre
sented instead the name of William
Ferri, of Ft'ooklyn. After a fight
which lasted four hours the commit
tee nil delegates finally agreed on
Fnite, States Senator Junes Wads
worth, Jr., Charles S. Whitman, Fred
erick c. Tanner and Klon II. lirown,
republican leader in Ihe state senate.
As Wailsw oii Ii, Tanner and Drown
are reputed anti-Whitman men the

a defeat for Governor Whitman. '
