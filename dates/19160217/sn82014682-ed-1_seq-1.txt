the national title in the tennis dou
bles with William . Johnston; Ward
Dawson, Southern California cham
pion, and Beals Wright, former na
tional tennis champion and star in
many,Davi8 Cup matches, will be the
big attractions at the opening matches
of the Carnival tennis tournament,
which begin at 3:4b this afternoon on
the! Pacific courts, Palace square.
The first match will begin at 3:45,
when Beals Wright and Alan Lowrey
meet John O'Dowda and C L. Low.
The first doubles event will feature
the former national champion, who be
came famous by defeating Norman
Brookes and the late Anthony Wild
ing, the great Australian x-air. With
Wright will be Lowrey, who has a
good serve and plays a consistent
game in all of his matches.
John O'Dowda has been practising
on the local courts for some time, and
his work has improved. The local
player will have as his partner one
of the stars of the East, C. L. Low ol
New York. : Low has appeared on the
court ip many eastern matches, and
his work on the local courts has been
favorably commented upon.
In the second match Griffin and
Dawson, who were the winners of the
doubles at the Manila tournament, will
oppose William Henoch and Walter
F. Dillingham. Griffin has been work
ing lout on the Pacific Courts, and ap
pears to be in good condition. He did
not appear to be up to his usual stan
dard in serving as several times in his
match against Castle and Eklund he
lost his point by poor service. It is
expected that Griffin will remedy this
defect in, his play during his first
match. , ..;
Ward Dawson in his practise
matches has proved to be a star at. the
court game. He has served well, cov
ered the court, and some of his re
turns -j have been sensational plays.
Dawson Is taller than Griffin, but has
not had the experience of the doubles
champion. Both players have gained
many friends by their fast work with
the racquet.
William Henoch and Walter Dilling
ham, who will meet the mainland
stars in the opening round, have been
playing together for some time and
show that they km? each other's
gaffie thoroughly, lioth players in
practise have handled their returns
well, and local devotees of the game
expect them to put .p a great game
against the mainland stars. '
