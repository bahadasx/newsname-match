launch a country-wide campaign ' of
newspaper and' magazine advertising
against the program for huge naval

SUSPECT ANARCHIST
OF BIG POISON PLOT
Two Hundred Banqueters Taken
Sick When Soup Is Served.
CHEf BELIEVED I'M UNI! IN S0ILKE
Lives Saved by Custom of Serving
Meager PortionsOnly Ounce
of Arsenic Used in Food.
Chicago "I do not wish to create
panic in Chicago," was the cryptic
reply of First Deputy Superintendent
of Police Schuettler. when asked Mon
day to give his views of the plot to
poison several hundred prominent Chi
cstroans.
Schuettler spoke testily and in the
tone of a man who is harboring the
secret of a great calamity. At the
same time he refused to admit that he
believed Jean Crones, missing assist
ant chef at the University Club, who
served the banquet, was the only man
who figured In the plot.
Two hundred of the distinguished
list of 400 banqueters who attended a
dinner given to Chicago's new Catholic
archbishop, Most Reverend George
William Munderlein, were taken ill of
poisoning after the soup course. The
archbishop did not partake of the soup,
nor did Governor Dunne, who was
among those present.
Indications are that Schuettler is
hot on Crones' trail and is gathering
evidence of a plot in which Crones was
only a unit among a gang of anarchists
who planned to kill the distinguished
group of men. This was borne oat by
the activities of his staff of detec
tives;, jlw.. :
Two .hours before Health Commis
sioner Robertson gave out the report
of F. O. Tonney, city chemist, that
3.7 grains of white oxide of arsenic
had been found In an analysis of a
pint of the poisoned soup served at the
banquet, two anarchists were taken
into Schuettler's office.
Both of the anarchists were ques
tioned for more than an hour. . When
they had gone Schuettler, in an . inter
view, admitted he had reports on
Crones for several months. He knows
the meetings Crones ' has attended,
what he said at those gatherings. He
admitted Crones was a red hot "dyed-in-the-wool"
anarchist, that he knew
Crones' assiociatea, that his detectives
have questioned these men.
Schuettler made known the fact that
Crones at a meetnig of anarchists last
May asked the speaker if his study of
chemistry he is an amateur chemist
would injure his standing in the an
archist movement. The speaker's re
ply throws some light on the motive
of the poison plot. It was this:
"Mo, a chemist, couia ao a great
deal in the anarchist movement."

Northern France. Of these 100,000
were for women, 60,000 for children,
48,000 for boys, 48,000 for girls and

ASTORIA COMMITTEE ACTIVE
. fOR LOCATION Of NAVAL BASE
' Astoria, Ore. A representative
committee of citizens of this city are
prosecuting a vigorous campaign or
the location of a government naval
base of the first class at or near the
mouth of the Colmubla river,
i. The csmgalgn Is predicated on the
broad claim that the Columbia river is
the logical location for the third Pa-
elflc Coast naval base of the first class;
hat it is capable of admitting and ac
commodating the largest vessels of the
United States navy; that it is the port
of entrance for. the greatest interland
of the Pacific coast; that it is the
shortest and most mobile from the Pa
cific to the Atlantic; that it has tribu
tary to it, easy of assembly, all ma
terials necessary for ' the maintenance
of a naval station; that it can be most
easily mined and fortified for defense
and for the operation of battleships,
scout cruisers and submarines; that
for the government to neglect to ade
quately equip it as a naval base of the
LORD BROOKE
Lord Brooke Is In command of the
Canadian forces that have proved
themsslyss ao brave and effective In
first class, and to fully fortify it, is to
leave the logical point of attack open
to the mercy of a hostile fleet.
This is a move in line with the non
partisan preparedness program of the
general government, and is a serious
effort to safeguard the lives and prop
erty of the citizens of the Pacific
Northwest. It is argued that the
equipment of the Columbia river as
outlined, is absolutely necessary for
the protection of the Northwest coast
of the United States,, including Puget
Sound and the large naval investments
at Bremerton. .-'.
Boiled down, the' argument, as set
forth by the chairman of the Astoria
committee. F. C. Harley, is as follows
The Columbia can and should be
made as impregnable as the Darda
nelles or the Keil canal.
This can be accomplished by fortifi
cations at its entrance and close within
its harbor and by the maintenane of
mines and submarines. '
The Columbia Bhould have the ad
ditional arm of a naval base of the
first class for speedy, mobilized re
sistance of attack-by a foreign fleet at
any part of our coast line from an
Francisco to the Straits of Juan de
Fuca. ' '
Our fleet at Puget Sound would be
bottled up in the event of war .with
Great Britain or her allies, - and with
the Columbia river as the point of con
centration of a large reserve it would
be possible to speedily send a fleet to
its relief, either to the Sound or to
other points on the coast as far' as-the
Southern Oregon line. : . .
The Columbia has . transcontinenal
rail lines and highways reaching di
rectly' by watergrade into the interior,
providing facilities for easy and expe
ditious- movement Of supplies and
troops. , , ; : i
The Columbia river basin . contains
about one-third of the available unde
veloped waterpower of the United
States, and ia rich In undeveloped ni
trates for the manufacture of explo
sives, v Considerable coal deposits lie
within its confines or aye directly trib
utary to it. ; ,
These resources, available xor our
own miantenance and ' defense, would,
in the present . unprotected and help
less condition of the Columbia river,
be of immense advantage to an attack
ing force, and easy of capture.

(Prepared by the United States Depart

Pine mice occur throughout the
eastern portion of .the United States,
and do much harm to fruit and orna
mental trees and shrubs, as well as to
garden produce and other farm crops.
Pine mice are seldom seen on ac
count of their molelike habits, for
they live in. their own underground

burrows, or in mole runways. The
Dresence of these mice In - mole bur
rows can usually- be detected by an
occasional -opening that they make to
the surface from the fun way.- Pine
mice are not so prolific as their near
relatives, the meadow mice,, but pro
tected as they are by thefr under
ground habits;- they sometimes become
abnormally , abundant This is espe
cial apparent In states where hawks

way of applying the oil. By confining
the animals in a closed pen the scram
bling -of the hdes over one another
will get the oil to all parts of the body.
As this will not destroy the eggs two
later applications are necessary..;'.
Scatter Air-Slaked Lime.
Intimately mix a gill of crude car
bolic acid with a Quart of dry. air-
slaked lime. Dust the dry lime over
every nart of the poultry bouse on the
walls, in the nests, over the roosts
and over the vards. It will be found
an excellent disinfectant and will de-
more to destroy the germs oi disease,
and with as little cost, than anything
else that can be tried.
Make Hens Comfortable.
Of course. It ia unpleasant to leave
a warm fire and go out and shovel the

house, to make things comfortable for
the hens these stormy days.

and owls, which are enemies of these
rodents, are continuously persecuted.
The mice live upon roots, seeds, suo
culen vegetation and bark of young ...
trees, and are very destructive to
sweet potatoes and other tubers, as
well as to trees, and shrubs. . . .
The most practical method of con
trolling this pest is by poisoning.
Sweet potatoes cut into small pieces
have proved to be the most effective
bait They are prepared as follows:
Sweet potato bait Cut sweet pota ;
toes into pieces about the size of large '
grapes. Moisten four quarts of these
and drain off excess moisture. Slowly
sift over them one-eighth of an ounce
of powdered strychnine (alkaloid),
using a pepper box or salt shaker for
the purpose, and stir constantly to dis
tribute the poison evenly.' ' '. "
One or two pieces of the poisoned
sweet potatoes should be dropped into
the tunnels through the natural open,
ings, or through openings made with
a stick. A systematic use of this
poison invariably results in an almost
complete extermination of pine mice.
These pests are also easly trapped, but
owing to the extra time and labor re
quired, this method does not compart
favorably with poisoning. ,.,
USE OF A MANURE SPREADER
When Used Judiciously . Increased
Yield In Crops Will Pay for De- .
vice Within Short Time.
If you haven't time to haul out the
manure from the barns and corrals
and spread it In the. old-fashioned way
with a pitchfork, buy a manure spread
er and do it right L
If you will use it judiciously, the In
creased yield in crops .will more than
pay the cost Within two seasons, and
the spreader, well cared for, will last
for many years,; ,
You cannot become an efficient farm
er and realize the maximum returns
from your time ' and labor without
good .implements.
Msrket Poultry.
French poulterers use considerable
care in preparing carcasses for the
market. In fact, they are experts In
that. line. They, not only know how
to stuff fowls to get a plumper car
cass, but they whiten and mold and
manipulate the fowls after killing, un
til they look almost good enough to
be eaten without further preparation.
To Get Rid of Twig Blight.
To help in controlling twig blight in
fruit trees get rid of all old, useless
pear, apple or wild fruit trees, prune
out badly blighted twigs and cut away
blighted spots . on , trunks or large
limbs.
. Have ' Poultry' House Dry. .
If the poultry nouse is perfectly dry,
and by that we mean the ground under
and above it, the chickens will not
suffer from the cold.
Storing Squashes.
Squashes should be stored ia a dry
place at a temperature of about 51
degrees. Do not lay more than oiu
deep on shelves.
