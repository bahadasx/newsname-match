Lansing Asks for Assurances of Safe
ty from Germany For Merchant Ves
sels, Even Though Carrying Defen
sive Armament.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 17. Secre
tary Lansing has accepted the Lusi
tania agreement as acceptable to the
United States insofar a3 it relates to
that case, but asked Bcrnstorff for as
surances that Germany will not carry
-out its policy of sinking merchant
ships without warning to liners, even
if they carry defensive armament.
The question cf what constitutes de
fensive armament is to be determined
later in a way not yet agreed upon.
It is suggested that the United
States may propose that guns mounted
on the stern of the ship and capable
of being swung from fifteen to thirty
degrees in either direction might come
within this class.
It is stated authoritatively that Ger
many, because of the unusual position,
cannot and will not accept the sug
gestion of the United States as it now
stands that liners carrying arms shall
be immune from attack under previous
assurances.

, was consigned to a Spaniard employ
ed by a German coal company at
'Santa Cruz, Teneriffe.
Captain Magune said hist vessel

but lie was allowed to proceed after
his papers were examined and the
schooner was searched.
"No time was lost in unloading my
cargo when we reached Teneriffe,"
Captain Magune said. "The coal was
unloaded into barges, which were
!sent straight to the sides of the in-
itemed vessels. One was the Cap
T&rtegal. a big pass;'tn'er liner She
looked like she had just come out of
,a shipyard, and I was told that all
the German steamships interned there
kept full crews aboard and appeared
ready to sail any moment their mas
ters desired."

GOOD OFFICER.
When democrats, republicans and
socialists are all pleased with one
and the same official,, that official
must of necessity be a goo-1 one.
That is the case with George Evans,
who represents the second commis
sioner's district of Carter cou'il on
the Board of County Commiss'.otier.
Members of all parties have told
Mr. Evans that they would not oppose
him for re-election, which Is a might"
big compliment to pay a man who Is
holding a political position. Mr.
Evans had a fight with all the parties
and had a hard fight in the primary
with representatives of his own party
in the first election. He walked in.
making much of his campaign, and
he succeeded in making the people
believe he was sincere, that he would
do his best in case of election, and
they look him at his word and gave
him a trial. The people all seem to
be mighty well pleased with his work.
