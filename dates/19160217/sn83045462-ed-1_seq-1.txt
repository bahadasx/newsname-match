th
Secretary Lansing today ac- ^
cepted the Lusitania agreement by
as acceptable to the United pr
States in so far as it relates to that 14i
case, but asked Count von
Lernstorff, the German ambassador,
for assurances that Germany m<
will not carry its policy of sink- th'
ing merchant ships without warn- he
ing to liners, even if they carry co:
defensive armament. mi
The question of what consti- ?ti
tutes defensive armament is to be ***
CO
determined later, in a way not yet s
agreed upon. It is suggested that ad
the United States may propostf pr
that guns mounted on the stern pI<
of ships and capable of being

Germany May Not Agree. p*
It was stated authoritatively ore
that Germany, because of its unusual
position, cannot and will ^
not accept the suggestion of the JJj
United States as it now stands ot?
that liners carrying arms shall be ?'
immune from attack under previnil
i ittc accnranrac
Secretary Lansing: explained fully to J?
the ambassador the position of the United j,o
States in the light of the new develop- 1
ments and is understood to have told him Al
that while Germany's position is recognixed
as well founded, the United States alt
must insist that Germany conform all her N?
practices to international law, inasmuch
as the entente allies have declined to make w<
any changes. *
The Lusitania agreement will be kept
y Secretarv Lansing and later will be pr
published with the assurances which the ci<
United States hopes to receive from Ger- a
many covering the points brought up by fit"
the new submarine campaign. * pa
Embodied in Separate Note.
The new assurances. If they are given, J
would be embodied in a separate note. ve
Meanwhile, it was said the United to
States would make efforts to have the
entente allies agree not to put guns w'
oi any mnu on passenger-caryying w?|
liners, and in turn would expect assurances
from Germany for their
safety. !"*
It was understood that the principal ??'
objection by the United States to ac- J*
eepting the Lusitania agreement as
governing the future was that it merely
referred to the assurances previously
given that unresisting liners would
not be sunk without warning, but did J10,
not actually embody or reiterate them. ]n
Ambassador von Bernstorff, when he "J?
returned to his embaaay, aent a long 7^
dispatch to his government setting tn
forth fully the position of the United J*c
States as Secretary Lansing had out- *Jy
lined It to hlra.
Will Study the Appendices.
Secretary Lansing said today that be- lai
fore the 8tate Department came to a th
conclusion on the effect of the new ne
submarine announcement it wanted to pr
study the appendices attached to the ol?
notification which were coming by wj
mail. The appendices contain delcrip- th
tions of alleged attacks on submarines
by merchant ships and a copy of the on
so-called secret British admiralty instructions
to masters to destroy sub- R
marines when possible.
The department wants to examine
the appendices, also in relation to assurances
given' to the United States
by the entente allies that liners sail- J
Ing from American ports would dls- ce
mount their guns. K
German officials here came to the .
conclusion today that the State Depart- 18
inent considers that their new memo- fir
randum has upset to some extent the 20
question of reprisals in the war zone .
about the British Isles and also that of
?*ruiser warfare in the North sea. th
American officials expressed the 00
opinion that the submarine contro
\+v?y with 'lermany cannot be closed
until fa?suraiM-e? are given that the ce
safety of neutrals and non-combatants nr
at sea has not been altered by the go
latest Germanic declarations. They
fear that the United States is confronted
with a long series of diplomat^- ex- JJ
changes, and state that the situation
is where !? was several weeks ago,
when it was described as "grave." 9
Unable to Grasp U. S. Attitude.
German diplomatic circles here seem
to be unable to understand the attitude a<
of the State Department. It was in- w
sisted that the German and the Aus- P*
trfan memoranda regarding the interrtion
to sink armed merchant ships were ccprompted
by the American memoran- sf
dum. and that had not the latter been ai
issued the central powers never would n<
have made their announcement.
Germany embassy officials declared
f they could not understand why the sit- JJ
uation should be disturbed, because w
they understood the Lusitaitia negotla- m
tfons all along were conducted as ap- ei
y lying to unarmed ships. It was estab- tt
shed after the sinking: that the Lusinia
bore no armament,
rheie is no indication that the inructions
under which American port
ithorities are operating: will be
tanged in the immediate future. The
cent American circular note to the
itente powers proposing disarmament
merchant ?hips is not regarded by
ate Department officials as in any
ay involving an abandonment by the
nited States of its contention that the
slllgerents should adhere to existing
inciples of international law in subarine
warfare.

CUT IN THE RATES
FOR M SERVICE
Terminal Company Voluntarily
Lops $10,000 From Its
Yearly Revenues.
SCHEDULE OF CHARGES
GETS COMMISSION'S 0. K.
Ten Per Cent Profit Figured. Not
nnfljitin<r Commissions Paid
to Hotels.
Reduced rates for taxi service were
announced by the Terminal Taxicab
Company. They have received the approval
of the public utilities commission
and will become operative April 1.
This is the second instance of a voluntary
reduction of rates being made
by a local public utility on the basis ot
the valuation of its property as established
by the public utilities commission.
The first case of this character
was the reeent reduction of certain
telephone rates, the property of the
telephone company being the first tc
?e valued by the commission.
It is estimated that the action of the
Terminal Taxicab Company will result
in reducing its gross revenues nearly
510,000 a year.
The company's present rates, one to
Ive passengers, are 50 cents for the
Irst half mile and 10 cents for each
luarter of a mile thereafter.
Schedule of New Bates.
The new rates for metered service
will be: For one passenger, 30 oente
for the first half mile, and 10 cents
for each quarter mile thereafter, and
20 cents additional per trip for each
of the second and third passengers,
and no additional charge for passengers
above three.
In accepting the new schedule, the
commission ruled that the payment by
taxicab companies of commissions to
hotels, clubs, etc., on business obtained
through such establishments is not a
proper operating expense in computing
net earnings for rate making purposes.
The value of the property of the
Terminal Taxicab Company, as established
by the commission April 2, 1915,
is $225,000. This value brought up to
flate is given at $276,500. The commission
states that of this amount $261,244
represents the fair value assignable to
publio service business, and that records
kept by the utility company In
question show that the new rates probably
will produce a return of 10 per
cent on this amount.
Ten Per Cent Fair Beturn.
The commission has Informed the
sompany it is of the opinion that 10
jer cent Is a fair and reasonable rate
?f return for this class of business,
lue to the fact that the taxicab business
is comparatively new, and its
Future therefore not so certain as older
classes of public service, and due to the
farther fact that the records show that
t is subject to wide variations in voiime
of business resulting from financial
and other conditions.
According to figures made public by
the commission, the company's gross
revenues under the present rates for
the fiscal year ended September 30,
1915, amounted to $225,842.14. It is
?stimated that the new rates will pro!?<**
a arrona revenue of $216,300. or a
reduction in gross revenue of 4 1-5
per cent.
Statement by Commission.
The commission's statement continues:
"Figuring the commissions paid out
by the company as a part of the
operating expenses, the company's return
under the present rates <gross
revenue less operating expenses and
taxes) amounted to $16,667.19, a return
yf 6.37 per cent on the fair value of
the company. It is estimated that the
company's return under the new rates
will amount to $7,300,000, a return of
per cent on the fair value of the
company.
"Excluding commissions from operating
expenses, the company's return
under the present rates amounted to
136,945.30, a return of 14.1 per cent on
the fair value of the company. It is
estimated mat tne company s return
under the new rates will amount to
&27.400.00, a return of about 10 per
Kent on the fair value of the company.*'
With the object of reducing: rates, the
company, according: to statements by
ts officers today, began last May to
<eep traffic statistics, segregating the
number of trips and the revenues
therefrom, with one, two, three, four
md five passengers, respectively, per
trip.
Three Plans Proposed.
After testing different rates by the
statistics compiled, the company proposed
three plans to the commission.
The first plan is the one that has been
accepted. The other two called for 30
cents for the first half mile and 10 cents
per each quarter of a mile thereafter
ror one passenger, with 20 cents additional
per trip for each of the second,
third and fourth passengers, and thf
same additional charge for each of the
second, third, fourth and fifth passengers.
The company looked with most favoi
on the scheme which the commission
has adopted, although the loss in revenue
under the other plans, it wa?
stated, would have been less.
According to officials of the company
the new rates are based on the theor>
that the thing most desired in taxi
service is a reuucuon in me cost or tnc
service of one-passenger traveling
alone. While the loss in revenue under
the new rates, it is stated, will be
approximately $10,000 a year, the company
expects that the reduction will
stimulate additional business.
It is understood that the Federal
Taxi Company will also reduce its fares
as soon as its meters can be adjusted.

WHITMAN BLOCKS
ROOT INDORSEMENT
Action of New York Governor
Puts flew Phase on Move
Favoring Former Senator. (
NAMES JUSTICE HUGHES
AS CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT
. . I
Republicans in Congress intensely
Interested in Situation Due to
New York Convention.
5
Republicans In Congress were intensely
interested today in the situation
growing out of the attempted indorsement
for the presidency of Elihu
Root by the New York republican con- ,
vention, and the subsequent proposal,
which appears to be hanging Are. to
have him indorsed by three of the four ^
delegates at large to the national convention.
Gov. Whitman has. temporarily at
least, blocked the latter proposition,
and the whole Root propaganda is apparently
"up in the air" for the time
being. If Gov. Whitman maintains his
present stand New York republicans
here say that the contemplated effect (
of the indorsement of Root may be a
flash in the pan.
The first move in the game was made \
before the committee on resolutions of
the state convention, when it was pro- i
posed to have the convention indorse
Mr. Root for the presidential nomina- <
tion. This effort was blocked by the ,
friends of Gov. Whitman, of Mr. Justice *
Hughes and of Col. Roosevelt.
The convention chose as delegates at *
large to the national convention .
United States Senator Wadsworth, 1
Judge Elon R. Brown, Frederick C. ?
Tanner and Gov. Whitman. According *
to accounts of the proceedings, the <
three first named delegates at large
met at the Republican Club in New ]
York yesterday and decided to issue a
, statement expressing their indorsement j
i nf Mr DAA*
1
Conference With Governor Planned. ^
In the absence of Gov. Whitman, who .
was in Albany, it wae decided, however,
to postpone issuing the statement <
until a conference could be had with i
Gov. Whitman.
A dispatch, quoting Gov. Whitman, \
from Albany to the New York Times,
published this morning, says: 1
"Say for me that I shall go to Chicago
in favor of nominating Justice 1
Hughes for the presidency. I was convinced
long ago that he was the choice 1
of the rank and Die of the republican
party, and I have had no reason to
change my mind about it. He is the i
man to bfat Wilson. 1
"If Mr. Tanner has written me ask- '
ing for a conference, of course, I shall
be glad to meet him and the other .
gentlemen designated as delegates at
large, either in Albany or New York." '
Puts New Phase on Move.
This balking by Gov. Whitman, in
the opinion of New Yorkers here, puts
an entirely new phase upon the movement
to indorse Mr. Root. As it is t
understood here, the object in indors- 2
ing Mr. Root was to stimulate interest
in his behalf in the states which will
soon hold primary conventions for the
selection of delegates to the national c
| convention, and also to kill off senti- y
ment in New York state for Roosevelt,
Hughes and Whitman. a
I It is generally thought by republi- g
cans here that such a move would have
had the desired effect to no inconsiderable
degree and would have resulted r
in a very formidable Root presidential
boom.
If. however. Gov. Whitman persists
in his refusal to join his three col- r
leagues in the delegation at large in >
indorsing Mr. Root, and continues to ?
threaten to precipitate a row on the *
floor of the convention, a big question t
is raised as to the effectiveness of the 3
effort to bring pressure to bear upon ?
the primaries in favor of Mr. Root.
The action of Gov. Whitman in holding
back from joining his colleagues
in the proposed Root indorsement is
explained to be his resentment of Wil- t
liam Barnes' part in attempting to hu- a
miliate him by pledging the delegates
at large instead of leaving them un- *
instructed or unpledged, thus afford- c
ing a fair field at Chi a go for himslf
or for Justice Hughes.

iberation of the long-suffering
\rmenian race. The position is
-egarded such a vital strategic
renter that its capture, it is believed
here, will relieve the pressure
upon the British positions in
Mesopotamia and have a profound
effect on the hostile clenents
in Persia and besides put
n jeopardy the Turkish forces
ihroughout Armenia.
The fall of Erzeruni is calculated
to facilitate the capture of
Trebizond, one week's march
northward, and thus secure the
Turkish gateway from Asia into
Europe.
Official Announcement.
Official announcement of the fall of
he city was made by Grand Duke
Nicholas, who telegraphed the empeor
as follows:
"God has granted the brave troops
>f the army of the Caucasus such great
telp that Erzerum has been taken,
ifter five days of unprecedented aslault.
T am inexpressibly happy to antounce
this victory to your imperial
najesty."

resterday, as 100,000 men. It is also
estimated that more than 1,000 guns
vere captured. According to report,
here were 467 guns in the outer forts.
!74 in the central forts and 200 field
funs at Erzerum.
City Was in Flames.
The last Russian official communicaion
gives few details of the fighting
iround the fortress. In fact, it seems to
tave been dispatched before the actual
apture was announced by Grand Duke
Nicholas. A part of the city was in

Russians a month ago broke through

It is stated that the Russians had to
rvercome the greatest of difficulties in
retting their heavy guns into position
or the final assault.
Fetrograd Is Elated.
PETROGRAD, February 17, via I ..onion.?The
fall of Erzerum. which had
een confidently awaited since th?
lews of the taking by the Russian
orces of nine of the eighteen forts
uarding the gateway to Asia Minor, is
he cause of great elation in Petrograd.
Controlling the roads through Arlenia,
with access to Trebizorrd, Tariz
and Mesopotamia, the capture of
Irzerum is calculated to have immense
trategic importance in the Russian
ampaign in the Caucasus. And it will
idlrectly affect the Balkan campaign
y relieving the pressure on the allies
t Saloniki.
The oonviction entertained by all
lussian military observers that Erze...

was based on the fact that
ie remaining: nine forts were of coniderably
less importance than those
Iready in Russian hands and could be
eadily flanked or even ignored in

:ronghold.
Plan of Defense Destroyed.
The taking- of the first fort is heaved
to have destroyed the plan of u
efense. since the Impregnability of
rzerum rested on the assumption of
te German engineers who constructed /ia
fortifications that the position was
tfe against assault from the south.
In spite of the intense cold and deep
tow. the Russian troops took Kop
ountain by storm and dealt the Turks
le first staggering: blow. Having
riven them from this position, the
ussian artillery broke through and
inked the other positions, which went
ke a house of cards, the result of the
ussian onslaught exceeding all exjctatlons.
