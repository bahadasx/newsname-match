BUGLE CALLS, BUT PEACE
MEETING OF VETERANS
Incidents Related Around the Camp
Fires of the Sixties Once More Boys
Daughters Make Hearts Glad.
The editor spent another pleasant
hour Saturday afternoon with . members
of High Point Camp of Veterans in their
regular monthly meeting, which have
become to be one of the real pleasures
of life with this newspaper man, so
much so that he' looks forward with de
light for the next one. These fine fel
lows, jolly as in the days of yore in
the early sixties when they shouldered
their guns in defense of the Southland,
are an inspiration to this generation.
Here they meet, transact business, tell
over again the ever-interesting stories
of the long ago "when knighthood and
southern chivalry were in flower," of the
roar of the cannon and the rattle of
musketry, of the charge to victory and
sometimes defeat, of the overwhelming
numbers of the north with improved
lighting irons pitted against the com
paratively small numbers of the south
with very poor fighting apparatus and
yet with all this they were never
whipped, only subdued by the force of
numbers, like a great avalanche thrown
against a frail house, of their leave-tak.

leaving wife and children at home under

to face the deadly hail of shot or shrap

covered grounds, through biting winds
and blizzards; still pushing forward
under the flag of Jjee and Jackson and
inspired as no men were ever inspired

sent thousands half -starved and racked
with pain into the very teeth of the
enemy, and yes, sad to say, into the
jaws of death Dixie! My what a song.

fBut," said on of the veterans, in !
'speaking- of the crude fighting imple
ments the Confederates had at first, "it
was not long, until we had plenty of
. the Yanks' guns, but we found it a
hard job to ge the stuff to use in them."
"Cussing," said one, in reference to
Mr. Small, late of the Soldiers' Home,
"you dont know nothing. ' We had the
'caasingest' colonels in our regiment you
ever saw. He cussed everything and then
. tursed because he had nothing else to
curse about. But, in striking contrast,
we had another colonel, a good Christian
man. One day his attention was called
to a soldier who had the fright and was
hid behind a tree. This colonel walked
10 to the fellow and said: 'My boy, get
up and show the blood of your mother.'
And that fpllow went into the fight and
redeemed himself."
"That reminds me," said another vet
eran, "a weak-kneed fellow m a cer
tain battle jumped into a ditch and
hid. The Colonel rebuked him, where
upon the fellow repiled that he just
eouldn' stand it. 'You are a baby said
the colonel. 'Wish I was and a doll
baby at that,' replied the fellow.
"Just to show you the inferiority of
our arms," said Commander Tom Woods,
"five men from every, company in the
regiment, crack shots too, were picked
for target practice, the prize a fine pig,
decorated in cedar and flags,, the time
Christmas morning. The distance was
160 feet, size of target, on foot square,
and only four men hit it. I was one
of them, coming third. A. A. Gordon
from Company E, 22nd North Carolina
Regiment, was also in the contest. Part
ot that pig was sent to James Petti
grew. "I gave two sons to the .service and
this here war talk impresses me more
than some of you. I also had three
brothers in the Civil war and one of
them was chaplain-surgeon. He was
with the dying, stood by the condemned
as the fataj shot was fired, helped in
the hospitals and performed a service
that isn't often exacted of a man. I
refer to the late Rev. Frank Wood, my
brother and his father," pointing to Geo.
T. Wood, so spoke the commander of the
camp. . ,
Cel. D. H. Milton made a very inter
esting talk on the "old soldier," past
and present and referred to the condi
tions at the Home, saying that things
mupt be made comfortable and pleas
ant for the old soldiers, . that the state
vas due this to them. His talk was
well received. .
Veteran John Little said that things
rr-iht not be as they should at the
Home but a lot of the trouble was due
to some of the soldiers -themselves in
not being satisfied and too prone
to growl. i
Committeeman Geo. T. Wood, as usual,
made a, good talk and touched on Wil
son's preparedness plan, which brought
forth some friendly discussion. Mr.
Wood is asrainst preparedness and his
uncle, the commander of the camp, is an
advocate of Wilson's policies. I have
been through one war and know, sam
the elder gentleman, and his nephew
Fmiled. '
Committeeman W. L. Stamey was
called upon and made a short talk along
the line of the southern Confederacy.
Others made short talks and the meet
ing was intensely interesting.
At the next meeting three delegates
will be named to the annual reunion and
I hope we can get it to come to Wil
-
mington, N. C., soon, said Commander
vvuuu. -
As usual refreshments were served by
the Daughters. Those ..present: Mes
dames J. W. Harriss, H. C. Field and
Misses I. Irvin Paylor and Venetia
Smith. The refreshments consisted of
coffee, sandiwehes and delicious old time
molasses cake. Cigars and smoking to
bacco were passed also. The phonograph
furnished music for the occasion. The
Daughters are, idolized by the old sol
diers and by common consent the spon
sor, Miss Paylor, who is the personifica
tion of gentleness nad womanly grace,
towards the veterans. It is she who
plans and succeeds for them. Cigars; to
baccos and other things are secured
through her efforts and everything made
comfortable and cozy at the headquar
ters. And all the Daughters they cook
and serve delicacies for those who they
are so glad : to honor and so regretful
that more has not been done long ago.
It would pay anyone to take a peep
into these gatherings of the old vets, it
would make ' you happier, stronger and
better.

YODTH AND AGE GATHER
THE FATHERERS-SONS BANQUET.
More; than one hundred fathers and
sons responded to the call for the Fathers-Sons
banquet at the v auditorium
Thursday night, the occasion being the
first anniversary of the Boy Scouts in
this city and the sixth anniversary of
the organization in America. It wasa
rather unusual event that called such a
happy crowd together but a very wise
one in that it gave the; fathers a chance
to view their sons from a different angle,
to see what the Boy Scouts stood for,
the uplifting influences exerted and in
cidentally to remind the older heads
that they too were boys at one time.
The banquet was a most pleasing af
fair.. Scout Jim Lyon led the Scout yell
and after Rev. C P. Coble offered prayer
the eais were ready to be served. Prof.
W. M. Marx was toastmaster and ably
filled the position imposed by being
leader of all the Scouts im High Point.
He briefly related the work being done
by the Scouts and extended a hearty
welcome to the fathers present. Shel
ton Woodson made the address of wel
come and Rev. L, W. McFarland respond
ed to the address of welcome and Scout
Carlton Kirkman did the honors to the
city council. S. L. Davis responded for
tht: council in an interesting talk. Chas.
McAnally, the 12-year-old poet, present
ed his seletcion on the "Fathers-Sons"
and recived applause.
The Camp Fire Girls served the three
courses to the 112 present.
Scouts Earle Smith, Hugh Hamilton,
and Arthur Kirkman', Jr., made timely t
talks
A competitive exhibition drill was
given by the Scouts, the. prize being
$2.50 from the city council and the
Eagle patrol, which made fire without

The judges were : W. D. Brooks, O.
D. Baxter, and Rev. C. P. Coble. The
patrols are: Eagles, Bob Whites, Rat
tlesnakes, Whippoorwills', Stags and
Wolfs, the latter . not competing.
Superintendent Haynes made a good
talk ore the Scout movement and com
plimented Prof. Marr, who was respon
sible for the Scouts here, on the fine
work he was doing.
The mothers of several of tne Boy
Scouts were onlookers, sitting in the
gallery.
It was" altogether a most pleasing
event, and one which should be repeated

A STATEMENT OF THE TELEPHONE
SITUATION.
The Bell Telephone Company's propo
sition for merging the two companies at
High Point into a new Bell company has
been discussed quite generally. Let us
now consider the proposition made by
the North State Telephone Company for
long distance Bell connection; and leave
it with the reader as to which proposition
is fair and which should.be adopted. At
the telephone meeting Wednesday night
the North State Telephone Company
submitted this proposition:
"We will install and operate free of
charge telephone trunk lines between our
switchboard and the Bell office ; so that
messages may pass, both in and out, be
tween the North State subscribers and
the Bell toll lines to and from all point's,
which we do not reach through our own
toll lines ; and let the Bell company make
all tickets and collect for all such mes
sages." -
The above plan is extremely simple
and practical. The Bell company could
easily terminate their long distance calls
then over the North State exchange with
out sending messenger after parties to
come to a Bell phone. They would get
more messages out from High Point also,
because people would not have to leave
their office and go out to a Bell phone in
order to send a message. It would give
the Bell toll lines the advantages of a
local exchange in High Point without any
expense whatever. Why would this not
be an ideal arrangement for both com
panies as well as the public in general?
A proposition similar to the above was
made to the Bell company even before
their exchange was built here, eight
years ago and was declined.
The following is Mr. J. S. WTelborn's
views of the Bell company's proposition:
"Have, the North State Telephone Com
pany, Thomasville Telephone Company,
and Lexington Telephone Company and
the Southern Bell exchange in High Point
appraised and a new company be formed
to take over above mentioned interests,
thereby giving the Bell company good
stock in a new company for their ex
change here that is now practically
worthless. The North State Telephone
company says this is not a fair propo
sition. It wouId be a bad business prop
osition, because the North State Tele
phone Company now has all equipment
necessary to give a good local service
as will be found anywhere. Now why
should we take over a parallel exchange
at a price that would exceed our pres
ent exchange and then give no better
service? The North State Telepnone
Company says it would be compelled
to raise rates as charged by the Bell
Telephone Company where they have an
exchange of 1,000 'phones, which are
as follows: $2.00 for party residence
phones; $2.50 for private residence
phones and $4.00 for business phones as
compared with the North State Tele
phone Company's present rates of -$1.25,
$1.50 and $2.00. Now this increased
rate would have to be borne mostly by
1 2 Pages
the 90 per cent of the' North State sub
"scribers who do not want or need. the -Bell
long distance connections. And for
this reason the .North State Telephone
Company says is not only is not justice
but an imposition on 00 per cent of its,
subscribers. - '
"The Bell Telephone Company answers
this by saying "the increased toll col
lections would pay a dividend on the ex
tra cost o,f their exchange." Mr. Hay-.
den says he thinks the collections on
the tolls which by the way (as propos
ed by the Bell company are 15 per cent
provided it does not exceed 30c on any
one message, which is the limit), would"
not pay for the necessary operator, ac- .
counting and collecting, and why is.it
that the Bell company is so inconsistent '
They say that the new company can ,
shoulder the cost of two exchanges and
do the work of both and operate it at
present rates charged by North State
Telephone Company, by reason of the
Bell long distance connection. In other
towns where the Bell company owns and
operates the "only exchange, and where
they have as many as 1,000 phones,
they charge $2.00, $2.50 and $4.00. Or
in other words, about 100 per cent more
than they say the new company can
give service for. here. '
"The truth of the matter is, the Bell ,
company has in the past, if not now,-'
wanted the telephone business in High
Point. They could not buy out Mr. Hay
den, and they have seemingly attempt- ,
ed to drive out the North State Tele
phone company. The Bell company
went before the corporation commission
and asked, that they might give free
telephone service in High Point until
they had installed 300 phones. The cor
poration commission granted their re
quest, and what were the results ? -
"M. Spier, the Bell advocate, says:
'When they began to collect for phones
the people had. the phones taken out
until now they have 83 phones in High
Point,' which is an admission that a K
large majority of the citizens do not,
want long distance Bell service at the
advance in price. Mr. Spier further
says that the Bell company does not "
care anything abput local business, but
that they are very anxious that-some
arrangement be made to give the citizens
of High Point the benefit of their long
distance service. I feel sure that if he
is so very anxious to give our citizens.
this service that the North State -Telephone
Company will make a contract
with the Bell Telephone Company, where-:
by the Bell coved run their long distance ' -lines
into the North State exchange and t '
give them connection to all o,f their sub-'
scribers and charge a small per cent for ,
their service, and with this arrangement ,
Mr, Spier. could give his. long 'distance ;
Service without any advancetpstto, pvr-L.:
citizen's. But" Mr. Spier syli: 'Ifj you "
want this long distance service,, gentle
men, bring your influence to ' bear v on . :
Mr. Hayden and --have him take . over
our exchange ; then, if he don't need it
here, the. new company could dispose of.
it elsewhere.' .
' "Now, if Mr. Spier wants to be fair,
why not admit the . Bell company has J
been beaten here and enter into an
agreement with the North State Tele
phone Company that will give the citi-'
zens of High Point long distance service
without extra cost, and as the Bell com
pany has much larger interests all oyer '
the country than the new company could
possibly have, use this High Point equip

"The independents Jiave prosecited
their fight to the best of their ability,
hoping for some agreement with the
Bell company or some other agency that
would be fair to the independent, inter
est. At last, the Postal Telegraph Com- .
pany said they would do their best for
us, and that they would enter into an
agreement with us whereby we could
use their trunk lines, with ave-minutes
limit for a certain price .' against the
Bell company's threeminiite limit , and
at about onehalf charged J. by Bell com
pany. Then the Bell company got busy '
and are trying to make agreements with
the" independent companies for long dis
tance service, and thereby put another
competitor out of the field on short no
tice. "There is a prevalent idea existing
that should the North State Telephono
company, Thomasville Telephone Com
pany, Lexington Telephone Company and
Bell Telephone Company agree, that Mr.
Hayden would control the stock of the
new company. That would be impossi
ble, as Mr. Hayden and .family now own
51 per cent in the North State, 60 per
cent in Thomasville and 33 1-3 per cent
in Lexington, and in a new company the
Bell company would own approximately
33 1-3 per cent, so with their interests'
and the other stockholders Mr. Hayden'
wouId be in the minority, and it is a
matter of speculation as to "how soon
the Bell would own the controlling :
stock. - "J. S. WELBORN."
