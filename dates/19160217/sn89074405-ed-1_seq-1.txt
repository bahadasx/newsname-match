BERNSTORff TO
N
NORTH
May Apply only to Italian
Ships—Is Reply to Lans
ing's Request.
Washington, Feb. 17.—Germany is
prepared to inform the United States
that if passenger liners leaving United
States ports with defensive armament
are to be Immune from submarine at
tacks without warning as the German
government promised last September,
as in the Arabic case, the Berlin gov
ernment expects some assurances that
the liners will not attack submersi
bles.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, has an engagement to
confer with Secretary Lansing and he
expected to convey this view in reply
to the secretary's statement of yester
day to the effect that it is desirable
that the German government make a
declaration that in carrying out its
new submarine campaign of sinking
armed merchantmen, without warn
ing after Feb. 29, it intended to abide
by the assurances it gave in the Ara
bic case that "liners" would not be at
tacked without warning unless they
attempted to resist.
Such assurances as It is indicated
Germany may now ask probably
would apply only to Italian ships, as
British passenger carrying liners have
not been armed, even with small guns
allowed for defensive purposes since
the outbreak of the war.
The question of what constitutes de
fensive armament is to be determined
later in a Way not yet agreed upon.
It is suggested that the United States
may propose that guns mounted on
the stern of ships, capable of being
swung from 15 to 30 degrees in eith
er direction, might come within that
class. It is stated authoritatively
that Germany, because of its unusual
position, cannot, and will not accept
the suggestion of the United States as
it now stands that liners carrying
arms shall be immune from attack
under previous assurances.
NO MORE WOMEN
ON GRAND JURIES
Red Wood City, Cai Feb. 17.—San
Mateo county, said to have been the

women on grand Juries, went back to
the old order of things yesterday when
the 1916 grand jury list, prepared,
by Judge George H. Buck, in the
superior court, was made public. It
contained the. names of thirty men.
In 1918 and the two years following
there were nearly, as many women as
men on the list. Doubt as to the le
gality of women grand jurors was said
to have, been responsible for the
change.
A bill to legalise them failed of
passage at the last regular session of
the legislature.

MONTANA PLAN
Of MARKETING

C. F. Lowrie, Speaking Be
fore Equity Society, Out
lines His state's System.
EUROPEAN METHODS
LARGELY EMPLOYED
Montana Organization Has
Grown Rapidly—Have
Wholesale Stores.
(By Staff Correspondent.)
Minot, N. D., Feb. 17.—Adoption
by North Dakota farmers of the sys
tem of marketing and supply pur
chasing used so effectively and with
rapidly increasing success by the
Montana union of the American Soci
ety of Equity, was urged Upon the
North Dakota convention of flip So
ciety of Equity by C. F. Lowrie, presi
dent of the Montana organization, in
an address yesterday afternoon.
Explaining in detail the rapid de
velopment of the co-operating buying
and selling agency established only a
few months ago in Montana, Mr.
Liowrie told the North Dakota farm
ers that adoption by them of the
same plan would involve great saving
to them In the purchase of their sup
plies, and greater profits to them in
the marketing of their products.
Newspapers Help.
"The Montana central marketing
proposition has been growing most
remarkably," said Mr. Lowrie. "With
the trade unions of Montana associat
ed with us, giving the Equity organi
zation the key to the great industrial
centers of the state with other or
ganizations of farmers joining us in
a body, and with the newspapers of
the state putting their shoulders to
the wheel in a spirit of general pro
motion, we may well say that our
movement is on the high road to suc
cess."
*.•: V.^-V&W
European methods of co-operative
marketing are being employed by the
Montana farmers, and Mr. Lowrie
says the adoption of the European
method is the solution of the Ameri
can marketing problem. It will be up
to the United States to meet, after
the European war, competition In
business that will force the farmers
Into co-operative marketing-!—the
elimination of the middle man—for
European countries, with, their per
fected organisations, will be. able* to
ship thtetr products to tfils '-^oilntry
and undersell the American farmers
in their own markets-
Mr. Lowrie explained that the
Montana system of central marketing
was adopted as a means of forcing
down the price of commodities, and to
bring about the marketing of their
own products at a greater profit. Both
objects have been attained.
Great Increase.

AMERICANS ENCOUNTER
TROUBLE IN TRAVELING
Strike of Mexican Railroad Men
Causes Delay—Soldiers Escort
the Train.
Washington. Feb. 17.—A dispatch
yesterday to the state department to
the Mexican border told of the dif
ficulties encountered by eight Ameri
cans and a number of other foreign
ers in getting from Chihuahua to El
Paso. The train on which they trav
eled was held at Chihuahua four days
because of a strike of railroad men
and reports that Villa's men were op­|who
erating along the line between Chi
huahua and the border.
The strike was reported due to a
demand of the men that they be paid
in silver instead of depreciated paper
money. It ended with an agreement
with the men to accept one-half their
wages in silver and one-half in paper.
The train was escorted by SSO soldiers.
From this number 75 were dropped
at various stations.

EVENING
EDITION
Washington, Feb. 17.—Moorefield
Storey, a Boston attorney, charged be
fore the judiciary sub-committee of
the senate that Louis D. Brandeis
helped wreck the New York and New
England railroad in 1892 and 1893,
with the result that it was absorbed by
the New Haven railroad.
When asked as to Brandeis' reputa
tion as a lawyer. Storey testified:
"I think his reputation in the Bos
ton bar is that he is very capable,
very energetic, and if necessary to ad
vance his objects, he is not scrupulous
as to his methods, nor is he to be
trusted."
Storey had been summoned by the
committee in its inquiry into the fit
ness of Brandeis. Senator Walsh told
the witness that C. W. Barron of Bos
ton had said Brandeis once was em
ployed to help wreck the New Eng
land railroad.
"I think that is true," said Storey.
"He described the New England as
the competitor of the New Haven be
tween Boston and New York."
New England Harassed.
"Shortly before the spring of 1892,"
Storey said, "the New Haven began
to harass the New England, which
ran part of the way to New York,
over the New Haven tracks. The New
Haven first refused to advance freight
for the New England. It seriously
interfered with its trains and there
wa*~.evezy indication that it waa, tha
I purpose of the New Haven road to
destroy the New England.

Teuton Shipper.
London. Feb. 17.—An Amster
dam dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph company says that the
manager of one of the greatest
German shipping companies, in
an interview in the Bremen Tap
blatt, expresses a most pessimis
tic opinion concerning the effects
of the possible breach of relation*
between Germany and the United
States. This shipper who. the dis
patch says, is believed to be Al
bert Ballln, a director-general of
the Hamburg-American Steam
ship company, is quoted as fol
lows:
"A breach of Germany's rela
tion with America would have a
most serious effect. All America's
money and munitions would be at
the disposal of the entente allies.
We should have to take over the
feeding of the Belgians and
America's attitude would prob
ably induce other neutrals to at
tack us. All our ships would Anal
ly be Interned In American ports.
This would take enormous wealth
from us. Our plight would be
most difficult, when the war Is
over, Germany will have to re
plenish her stocks of raw materi
als. Do not let us entertain any
illusions with regard to England.
She will continue a commercial
warfare long after military opera
