"give this article a irood all ing."

There is more than one lesson in
the above cartoon. Th? suffrage
Usson is plain. It is true. The
one issue upon which women have
shown some signs of dividing a
long sex lines at the ballot box
is In regard to laws for the pro
tection of children.
Yet even here it is easy to ex
aggerate. Only where the work
ing women are organized and ed
ucated to vote for the interests of
their class and their children
does legislation for the protection
of children follow woman suf
frage. Th? cartoon tells this as plainly
as It tells the need of votes for
women. The United States is still
ruled almost absolutely by the
class that draws profits from the
labor of men, women and children

men, have not learned to use their
votes in their own defense.
