Professor Hall has seismograph rec

He says:
"I placed a delicate seismograph like

the top of the tower. Then I went
down to the ground and about once In
a second pushed my hand against the

NEW GROUNDHOG YARN.
Did Not Re-enter Hole Because It Was
Frozen to Death.
Norwich, Conn.Byron P. Fox, an
Uncasville farmer, appeared in Nor
wich recently with a story that may go
to show why Mr. Groundhog failed so
miserably as a weather prognosticator
this year. According to Mr. Fox, who
admitted that until recently his confi
dence had never- been shaken in the
groundhog prophecy, a fine specimen of
the woodchuck was found frozen to
death near Glasbrenner's livery and
garage in Uncasville recently.
"It must have been layin' near the
road there for over a week." said Mr.
Fox. "Cose, it didn't see its shadow
the day it came out, and 1 suppose the
critter was too blamed proud to crawl
back afterward. Anyhow, it stayed
out and was frozen. No wonder we're
freezin' weather."

they must not make intervening trips

GIRL'SMIND FAILS
TO TELL OF CURE
Paralytic Nor Parents Dis
cover She Is Better.
'S CASE A PUZZLE.
Bedridden and Speechless For Three
Years After Fall, Now Cured Except
ing Her Mind Fails to Register Fact.
Los Angeles Teacher Led Her to
Walk and Speak.
Los Angeles.One of the most re
markable cases known in medical his
tory and one fraught with Interest
both to surgeons and to students of
psychology has been called to the at
tention of scientists in this city. It is
the case of Carlotaa Sausedo, a fifteen
year-old schoolgirl.
For three years Carlotaa was con
sidered a hopeless paralytic, who
would never be able to speak or walk.
She had been injured by a fall on her
head from a swing when she was
twelve years old.
It is declared now by doctors and
her teachers that whatever body or
brain injuries she may have received
from that fall have been absolutely
outgrown and that she is perfectly
normal physically and mentally, ex
cept that her mind has failed to regis
ter the fact of her recovery.
In other words, according to the
doctors, if the child's mind can be
wakened to the fact that she has re
covered from her fall she will be able
to walk, talk and develop as other
children do.
While three weeks ago Carlotaa
could not speak and could not walk
alone, today she speaks with ease,
walks without help and can even walk
up and down the school stairs alone.
Three years ago the little girl pitched
from a swing to her head. She was
picked up and stood-on her feet In
stead of standing still she began to
whirl round and round. She was en
tirely unable to stand still or to sit up.
She was put to bed and pronounced a
hopeless paralytic. Her power of speech
was completely stopped.
With the beginning of the present
school term Miss Ettie Lee, one of the
grammar school teachers, discovered
the child. There were five other chil
dren in the family, all normal, and
Miss Lee inquired into Carlotaa's his
tory. Securing medical examination,
she learned that, whatever bodily in
jury may have been caused by the fall,
it no longer existed.
"We cannot tell Carlotaa she is not a
cripple or sick, because her mind has
to be wakened up gradually to that
fact," Miss Lee said, "but we are
teaching her by degrees. She is placed
in a special class at school, and her
teacher invents little exercises and les
sons for her.
"She had to be almost carried to
school. Her teacher made a small sand
pile in the playground and many times
a day took Carlotaa. there and helped
her walk over it Today Carlotaa can
wa'k up and down the school stairs.
"When school opened she could not
talk. Now she talks to us and knows
what we say. She can count In English
and Spanish and can write her own
name. Her father tells me she was un
usually bright before the fall, and I
see no reason to suppose that she can
not be restored to her former condition.
"She has been in bed for the greater
part of the past three years, as the
schools at Chino would not take her in.
So while her body healed itself, appar
ently, her mind, never recovered from
the shock of the fall."
Little Carlotaa was taken to the Par
ent-Teacher clinic for further examina
tions to verify the diagnosis of other
doctors. If a similar report is made her
special teachers will continue as they
have begun in their novel work of
teaching the child's mind that her body
Is neither paralyzed nor injured in any
way.

TO SCHOOL ON SKIS.
Then Crawl Down to the Door
Through a Hole In the Snow.
Ellensburg, Wash.Coming to school
on snowshoes and skis, sliding over
the schoolhouse roof and climbing
down to the door through twelve feet
of snow is the experience of children
at the school at Meadow Creek. Mrs.
Mary Boedcher, county superintend
ent, has received a number of letters
which tell the children's idea of the
situation.
"Our schoolhouse is about twelve
feet high on the outside," writes one
boy, "but the snow is so deep that a
person can walk right over and not
know that there is a building there.
We have to crawl down eight steps
through a hole in the snowbank to get
into it."
"We live in a tent," says a twelve
year-old girl in the seventh grade.
"The roof is covered with large pieces
of bark. All that you can see of the
house is the very front, where you go
out. I went halfway to school on the
skis and crawled a little way so as not
to go in so deep."
Mrs. Beach, the teacher, in her re
port to Mrs. Boedcher, said that in
spite of the snow school kept up every
day and thaf only two absentees were
noted during the severe weather.

Decker, then employed in a Detroit
automobile factory.
He was called back to Des Moines
by the illness of a sister in February.

PREFERRED CAVE TO
LIFE IN A SOD HOUSE
Unique Home of Pioneer and
Family Brought to Light,
Garber, Okla.The falling of five
feet of cement porch of a farmhouse a
half mile north of Garber brings to
light the unique home of a pioneer of
this section.
Under this porch was a cave. The
cave was dug in 1894. At a point
along a little ravine a sandstone ledge
cropped out, and there S. H. Peters
tunneled under and excavated two
large rooms, with a sandstone ledge
about three feet thick for a roof. The
rooms extended sixty feet under the
ground, and at the deepest place there
was perhaps eight feet of dirt on top.
To the back room a skylight 3 by 5
feet was opened.
The rooms were plastered and white
coated, and the rock roof was white
washed, making it light enough for
one to read newspapers in any part of
the cave. It was very dry at that
time, and coffee kept in the cave
ground easily. S. H. Peters and his
family lived there many months be
fore he built a home above ground.
The stovepipe ran up the skylight
and to persons passing along the road
the smoke coming out of the ground
was a novel sight. Hundreds of per
sons visited this cave home, and all
wondered why the roof didn't fall in.
as it was not supported by timbers.
When the wet years came a little
spring in the cave which furnished all
the water for the family overflowed
the rooms-at times, and in recent years
when the drain became clogged the
cave filled with water. The pioneer
later built a house almost over the
care.'
S. H. Peters was but little longer
digging the cave home than was re
quired to build a sod house of the same
size. Sod houses were the first homes
of most of the pioneers. The plaster
was the only expense to the cave
home. Today this section has the fin
est country homes in the state and is
hi the wheat belt.

Everett, Wash F. D. Mack, teacher
in the Central school, has spent about
$40,000 in educating eighteen students,
seventeen boys and one girl, during the
last sixteen years, according to a story
he reluctantly told a newspaper repre
sentative.
Living on his school salary in a mod
est way both in Minnesota, his former
home, and in Washington, he has earn
ed the money to send students through
universities by writing short stories
and magazine articles. He has paid
out between $2,000 and $3,000 on each
of his "children."
Some of the youngsters were or
phans, and some had one parent, but
all were eager to learn and were handi
capped by lack of money.
The thirteen boys who are alive are
all actively engaged in the professions
in which Mr. Mack has educated them.
Two are druggists, one being in St.
Paul and the other in Los Angeles.
Two are instructors in the University
of Minnesota, where they were grad
uated. One teaches mathematics, and
the other is an instructor in German.
This latter young man plans to be a
physician and in 1914 married a girl
who wished to go to Germany to get
her master's degree, so he and his
bride sailed for Germany to continue
their studies, only to be turned back by
the beginning of the war.
Mr. Mack sent him through Normal
school, the University of Minnesota
and Harvard, where he received his
master's degree.
A young man who chose to be a
broker received his education at the
University of Illinois. He started out
to be an architect, but changed his
mind and took a commercial course.
He was graduated four years ago and
is now in Minneapolis engaged in the
lumber brokerage business. He is the
best money maker of the "family." In
his four years out of college he has
made $40,000.
