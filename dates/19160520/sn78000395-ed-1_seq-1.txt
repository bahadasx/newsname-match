WALSH SPEAKS OUT LUSEINJUIKTION10
Daring Chairman of Industrial
Relations Committee For
Eight-Hour Day
THROWS NEW LIGHT ON
LIFE OF RAILROAD MEN
Discredits Statistics Given To
Public Officers and Managers
of Railroads.
PITTSBURGH, May 18 —-Address­
ing a great mass meeting: of the Rail­
road Brotherhoods in the Lyceum
theater, Frank P. Walsh, chairman
of the Committee on Industrial Rela
tions, said:
"I hold that the eight-hour day is
so incontestably right that the de­
mand for it is not a subject for arbi­
tration. It should be taken as a mat­
ter of inalienable right through the
economic power of the workers. Not
only should no man be compelled to
work more than eight hours a day
but no man should be permitted to
work more than eight hours a day
except with the consent of his fellow
workers and under conditions which
they impose, by their collective bar­
gaining power, to see that the one
man does not invade and imperil the
rights of his fellows."
"I hold further," continued Mr.
"Walsh, "that the right of workers to
collective bargaining and the right of
every worker to be protected by his
fellow workers from arbitrary dis­
charge are also the inalienable Tights
of modern industry and they also are
not subjects for arbitration."
"What the Railroad Brotherhoods
are demanding," said Mr. Walsh, "is
that instead of a ten-hour day they
be given an eight-hour day, or* if the
railroads won't grant that, then that
they be given time and one-half for
time over the eight-hour limit.
"The railroads say that this is
merely a demand for wages to be in­
creased. Suppose that the Brother­
hoods demanded without any alter­
native that they be given the eight
hour day (which every principle of
humanity and human efficiency says
is long enough for exacting risky and
vigilant labor) and that the railway
employes be returned to- their homes
at the end of eacl* day'a work with­
out expense to them as most other
employes are:' What a* howl would
then go up from the railroads as to
vhe exhorbitant cost that would
mean to them. If these righteous de*
mands of the railway employes have
become oply demands for increased
wages it is because the railroads
themselves have made that the alter­
native.
"Bear in mind that the great ma­
jority of railroad employes are a
great part of their time away from
their home cities.
They have to pay their own expenses
for lodging, food, etc., and that
/fomes out of their wages. What are
these
wages? They will average, it is
claimed, $1,242 a year. That is per­
haps $100 or more too high, inas­
much as it takes into account the
higher average of the 73,000 passen­
ger conductors, engineers and others
who are not involved in this contro­
versy. But suppose it is $1,242 a
year. The daily average wage for
trainmen is $2.73 for a ten-hour 'day
or 27 cents an hour. To make $1,242
a. year at 27 cents an hour means
that a man must work 4,600 hours in
the year, and that means the equiva­
lent of 460 ten-hour days, or 365 days
of more than 13 hours' labor each.
The way it actually works itself out
is that for many, many days of the
year the men who run your trains,
and who keep the tracks safe and
into whose hands the lives of all the
rest
are placed, and safely placed
where the greed or cheapness of the
financial managements does not in­
tervene, those men must work to the
point of exhaustion for sixteen or
more hours out of the twenty-four.
"We have been told by the rail­
roads that there have already been
considerable percentages of wage in
crease to the train operatives in the
past few years. A percentage of
wage increase depends on what you
start with, if you start with such a
miserably low wage that a man and
his wife and children cannot live on

NATIONAL ERECTORS
ARE PRIME FACTORS
Opponents of Sympathetic Strikes
Start One Against Organized
Labor.
The St. Paul building trades' unions
and all their officers and members
may be enjoined from declaring a
strike on the State Historical! Library
building now being constructed by the
George J. Grant Construction com­
pany.
The attorneys for the Minnesota
Employers' association last week made
application to the district court of
Ramsay county for a restraining order
in which a large number of allegations
are made against St. Paul building
trades' unions. The Minnesota Em­
ployers' association is assisted by Wal­
ter Gordon Merritt, attorney for the
National Erectors association. The
non-union employers back of this pro­
position, who declare against sympa­
thetic strikers and secondary boycotts,
are united in a sympathetic effort to
destroy the influence and power of or­
ganized labor in St. Paul.
They believe in United action and in
sympathetic action to protect their in­
terests as employers, and they would
deny the same right to the unions of
workingmen.
All of the forces that are against
union labor in the United States are
bending their efforts to destroy or­
ganized labor in 6t. Paul. If they can
win in their issue in Ramsey county,,
they believe they will be able to stem
the tide of organization in Minnesota.
In their allegation the employers
claim that the St. Paul Labor unions
are engaged in an unlawful, conspiracy
in restraint of trade and are particu­
larly violating the provisions of the
Minnesota anti-trust law. They could
not bring action under the federal law
now since the passage of the Clayton
Act, and they are hopeful that the
Minnesota courts will hold contrary to
the letter and spirit of the federal
law, which declares that the "labor
of human beings is not a commodity
or article."
Organized labor in Minnesota is pre­
paring to introduce a bill in the next
legislature embodying the. chief- feat­
ures of the labor clausie of the Clayton
anti-trust law. There is no tioubt iut
that the employers of Minnesota, in
anticipation of organized labor's pro­
gram, have gone into the Ramsay
county court for the purpose of weak­
ening the influence of labor in this
state. If the case is brought to an
issue it will do more to call the atten­
tion of the people of this state to the
necessity of relieving organizations of
labor and farmers from the provisions
of the anti-trust laws, which were only
intended to prevent corporations from
monopolizing the products of labor,
although in this respect such laws
have been dismal failures up to this
time.
The lawyers for the iMnnesota Em­
ployers' association, acting 'for
fthe
George J. Grant Constructions Com­
pany, are seeking-damages from
the
St. Paul building trades council, its
affiliated unions and all their
mem­
bers, in the sum of $25,000. They
further ask that the unions be perma­
nently enjoined from boycotting or
threatening to boycott, calling sympa­
thetic strikes or inducing others tb do
so and making, uttering or communi­
cating any statement announcing that
the plaintiff in the action is unfair to
organized labor.
It is the most drastic and
wide-
sweeping claim ever presented in a
Minnesota court against organized
labor. The labor unions have
en­
gaged Daniel W. Lyvvler, the
well
known St. Paul attorney, to handle
their case.

A general increase of 10 per cent
in wages was announced today to all
employes of the Bethlehem Steel

pany who are on the hour or tonnage

COMMERCIAL CLUB
ORGANIZED
The Pulutb Commercial club can be depended .upon
to do the unpopular thing at any time a vote is taken
upon any proposition of public importance.
Last Friday evening at a special meeting of the club
i0 propositions affecting the national welfare were
voted upon. The chamber of commerce of the United
States requested the Duluth Commercial club to register
its vote on 10 propositions relating to preparedness,
national defense and militarism. Six of the propositions
contain more or less merit,, but the other four are par­
ticularly vicious.
The members of ,the club debated at length over the
proposition recommending that "universal military train­
ing be adopted as a fundamental democratic principle
of our military policy and be enforced by law to furnish
adequate land, sea and industrial forces in peace and
war." When the vote was taken on this proposition
but one member voted against it, Stillman H. Bingham,
editor of the Duluth Evening Herald.
But the vote on such a drastic military proposition
by the Duluth Commercial club by no means voices the
sentiments of the people of Duluth. The members of
congress must not be misled into the belief that the
sentiments of the Duluth Commercial club are the senti­
ments of the majority of the people of this city, and par­
ticularly in the working classes.

UNION MAKES APPEAL
TO STRIKE BREAKERS
CHICAGO, May 18.—Strikers at
the McCormick plant of the Interna­
tional Harvester company issued this
appeal to strike breakers last week:
"We know we are entitled to more
bread and to a little more butter and
to more rest. The terms offered'us
by the company are not enough for a
decent living, and we—both men and
women—reject them and stand for
our jjust demands.
"We are certain to win this battle
unless you jobless ones take our

conditions. Wait till we get better
ones. Stay away from our jobs while
we are striking."

DIILUTH AND SUPERIOR, MAY 20, 1916.
Queer Reasoning Advanced By
President of National Asso­
ciation of Manufacturers!
NEW YORK, May 18.-—James A.
Emery, general counsel for the na­
tional association of manufacturers,
again qualifies as an up-to-date
economist." In his address *o the
convention of the National Metal
Trades association, he plrdicted—as
others have—that a migoty interna­
tional industrial war wilr be started
after the present European war closes.
He then assumed that workers in the
old world, inured to suffering and
sacrifice during the past two years,
will accept these coadg^&os forever,
and that "this fact places Americans
at a disadvantage in the struggle ofr
markets.
Mr. Emery presented this doleful
prospect to his sympathetic auditors:
"This nation faces war, not a san­
guinary contest, hut an economic
contest, between the industrial and
commercial forces of the old world
and the new.
"How are we to meet armies trans­
formed into industrial organizations,
the unskilled raised to the zenith of
capacity, women workers trained in
large numbers to special dexterity
and excellence, and management
trained under the pressure of war
and backed by a people drilled in
self-denial to exercise in the contest
of peace the virtues they have ac­
quired in the discipline of war? Are
we to meet this with high wage cost,
short hours and low efficiency, while
they attack us armed with low wage
costs, long hours and high effi­
ciency?"
ORGANIZED LABOR IS
ACTIVE IN MONTREAL
MONTREAL, Quebec, May 18.—At
no time in the history of this city have
the organized workers been more ac­
tively engaged in bettering working
conditions. The unions of journeymen
tailors and garment workers are de­
manding that wages be increased. The
present rates are below almost every
other Canadian city.
The Longshoremen's unions have
signed a new agreement with the

around from the air, as it would
be for anybody else. I cannot

MILITARISM
WILL OPPOSE IT.
All of the propositions voted upon by the club will b»
presented to labor organizations of Duluth. They will
be carefully discussed, after which it is safe to predict,
any'and. all propositions having to do with compulsory
military service in the United States will be defeated.
Tbe workingmen are not going insane over the so
called preparedness plans advanced by the munition
manufacturers. The men who must bear the brunt of
the fitting in times of war have no, fear about the
future Jf-this country. They look with suspicion upon
this efrort on the part of the business interests to induce
congress to spend lavish sums in preparation for war.
Labor ft hopeful that the world is now having its last
greq,t war. When the nations in Europe return to peace
there will be no necessity for the United States to main­
tain a large standing army or to spend millions of the
peoples' money in building, unnecessary fortifications.
Compulsory military service in any country is incom­
patible with democracy. There can be no democracy
where there is militarism. The advocates of the 10
provisions voted upon by the Duluth Commercial club
may declare that they are opposed to militarism and are
advocating these measures solely for national defenses,
but a careful study of the proposition will convince any
honest citizen that if their spirit is embodied in the law
of this nation we will soon become the most pronounced
military nation in the world.

WASHINGTON, May 18.—Comp­

called on national banks to furnish
information as to the number of em­

a period of five years preceding the
date of each call. The national bank
supervisor favors yearly vacations
"because most men are physically

their duties most efficiently when
they have the benefit of a yearly va­

advantages, including the better op­
portunity of having an impartial

PLEASED TO LET "DEAD
PAST BURY ITS DEAD"
But Not Fair To Employes To
Shoulder Heavy Burden of
Past On Them.
CLEVELAND, May 18.—In a state­
ment given out today by the Railroad
Transportation Brotherhoods' who
are jointly asking for an eight-hour
day, exception is taken to a pamphlet
issued by the railroad officials en­
titled: "The Malady of the Rail­
roads," by Howard Elliott, president
of the New York, New Haven &
Hartford railroad.
The employes' statement admits
that Mr. Elliott is well qualified to
speak with authority on some phases
of railway malady, judging from cer­
tain recent revelations about the for­
mer financial mismanagement and
wrecking of the road which he is now
directing.
Mr. Elliott says: "It is the present
and future which confront us. Let
the dead past bury its dead." There
must be many things of the past in
regard to the New Haven misman­
agement over which Mr. Elliott
would like to draw the veil and have
the public forget, especially the most
recent revelations.
However, the evils of the "dead
past" have saddled a load of debt on
the living present and when this
heavy burden is used as an argument
against fair wages and fair hours to
employes of the present time, we do
not forget this "past" of the New
Haven and of other roads that are so
strenuously opposing the movement
to better the conditions of its em­
ployes.
The Interstate Commerce Commis­
sion says in a report on its research
into the financial workings of the
New Haven system, that it "disclosed
one of the most glaring instances of
mal administration revealed in all
the history of the American Rail­
roads."
A reasonable estimate of the -loss
of the New Haven by reason alone of
waste and mismanagement," the
^mmission places .at. an..amount be*
tween sixty million dollars and ninety
million dollars.
For-many a year to come these
ransactions are to- be- a drain upon
the New Haven's resources ind the
employes are expected to do con­
stantly increasing labor without a
der to make up this "loot."
No wonder Mf. Elliott would like
to have the public forget and "let the

But the
ghost of highly inflated "capital se
cunties" cannot so easily be lis
posed of.
Mr. Eiliott presents statistics but I
does not allow in these figures, for
Jt is claimed by Mr. Elliott that
this is a, poor time to make a demand
for an increase in pay.
If, in these prosperous times it is
a "poor time" the employes are at a
loss to know when would be a good
time. They were told early in the
year of 1915 by the Federal Arbitra­
tion Board, that ^no improvement in
their conditions of employment could
be granted, because there
was a

the fact that the basis of an' eight
hour work day already exists on a
number of railroads. He does not
allow for the fact that the demand
for an eight-hour day does not affect
the hundreds of thousands, of train
employes in passenger service
throughout the United States.
Much stress is laid by Mr. Elliott
on the fact that "only 10 per cent of
the railway army now absorbs 28 per
cent of the railway's pay-roll." He
fails to mention the very important
fact that his 18 per cent constitutes
the most skilled of the employes who
are bearing a greater responsibility
and running greater risks than any
other class of railway employes. It
would be just as convincing if Mr.
Elliott would show the large salaries
received by a comparatively few
higher administrative officials as
compared to the total expense of ad­
ministration along side of the nu­
merous lesser officials and clerks.

GATHERING TO TAKE UP
IMPORTANT LEGISLATION
Special Train to Be Run Direct
From Twin Cities To
Hibbing.
E. G. Hall, president, and George
W. Lawson, secretary-treasurer, this
week issued the call for the Hibbing
convention of the Minnesota State
Federation of Labor. The meeting
will be called to order at 10 o'clock
in the morning of Monday, July 17,
and the convention will remain in
session for three days.
This is to be the most Important
convention of Minnesota labor unions
held in recent years. Important
legislation i9 to be taken up and the
delegates will go on record in favor
of state insurance and a state law
similar in character to the Clayton
act recently enacted by Congress.
Secretary-Treasurer George W.
Lawson of St. Paul has arranged for
a special train over the Great North­
ern to carry the Twin City delegates
from St. Paul and Minneapolis direct
to Hibbing. The train .will leave St.
Paul, Saturday evening, July 15, at
11 o'clock, arriving at Hibbing at 8
o'clock Sunday morning. The same
train will get the delegates back to
their homes after the adjournment of
the convention Wednesday in time
fo|i them to return to work Thursday
morning. The Duluth delegates wiil
leave here Sunday morning over the
Duluth, Missabi & Northern railway.
The Hibbing labor unions are mak
ing elaborate preparations for the en
tertainment of delegates. A visit to
several of the mines and other towns
on the ranges is planned. The call I
reads as follows:
"In conformity with the constitu­
tion you are hereby notified that the
