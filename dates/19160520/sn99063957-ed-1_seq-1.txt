tative returns at 2:15 this afternoon:
President Charles Evans Hughes of New York.

throughout the state gave Olcott 13,576; Mores 10,683.

er in the western district grew as the count progressed.

tained a small lead over five opponents. Scattering re

Keaay b,vz6; McMahon 8,241; Ivanhoe 6,003; Five are to
be elected.
Hughes Delegates Win.
It seems pretty certain that the can
didates for delegate at large to the
ippublicau national convention, commit
ted to Hughes for president will have
ft safe majority. The delegation will
be headed by ex-Senator Fulton and his
colleagues will prqbnbly be Clins. If.
Carey, (!eo. J. Cameron, and Arthur C.
Kpeneer.
Returns are too incomplete to make
vp the list definitely, as there were
more Hughes men running than places
On the ticket.
The race for delegates in the first
congressional .district is between C. P.
F.ishop, Albert Abraham and W. W.
Calkins, these being three Hughes can
didates, ami only two places to fill.
.'Jj L. Steeves was the Roosevelt candi
date, and he seems to be out of the
running. Bishop is undoubtedly elect
ed nnd the returnii are favorable to
Abraha's election of Calkins.
Besults in Multnomah.
In Multnomah county there were

in the count.
Marshall Defeats Majors
Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall
had a big lead over Governor Majors of
Missouri in the race for the democratic
nomination for vice-president. Presi
dent Woodrow Wilson was unopposed
for the presidential nomination.
Religion Cuts Figure.
Upturns are slow because of the
length of the ballots. These figures,
whowever, are from every part of the
state, and as the count as proceeded,
i Hug lie a has steadily maintained his
icnu.
Only a part of (lie votes have been
counted. It was estimated that about
180,000 ballots were oast in yesterday's
primary election throughout the state.
Practically till of these wero republi
can. It became evident today that the
"silent rote" of the republicans went
solidly in favor of the New Yorker as
the standard bearer of the 6. O. P.
Of scores of political organizations
throughout the state which endeavored
to throw votes one way or the other in
bunches, not nne had recommended
Hughes. The German-American organ
ization, which had bepn regarded as a
strong factor in the election, supported
Cummins. Others, including the A. P.
A., or "Patriots," atempted to throw
their votes either to Cummins or Bur
ton. Although a pre-election campaign
was conducted for Hughes, it was a
quiet affair, and was overshadowed by
the oratory of the CumnUns and Burton
factions.

huge cloud of poison gas billowing to

AUSTRIANS ATTACK
Losses On Both Sides Are
Staggering Is the Verdun
of Italian Front
By J. H. Hearty
(United Press staff correspondent)
Rome, May 20. Having arrived at
Trent with his staff, the Austriua
crown prince today began directing tho
campaign against Yicenza, the Verdun
of tho Italian front. General Cadorna,
the Italian chief, is likely to go to the
Trentino front. .
Further Italian retirements boforc
the terrific Austrian pounding were of
ficially admitted today. But the do
fenders have every confidence that the
enemy offensive has nearly spent Ub
strength.
With a heavy sacrifice of men and
ammunition, the Anstriuns only pene
trated the Italian frontier once, in As
tico valley. The invaders are still 22
miles from Vivenza, the reported goal
of the Austrians.
A quarter of a m.tlion Austrian
troops nre engaged aroiutd the Adige
valley. Losses on both sides have been
staggering, but no figures are available.
The Austrians attempted to catch the
Italians off their guard while impor
tmt troop movements were under way.
After three days fighting, the Italians,
rather than sacrifice men ncedlesslp,
retired to other positions.
Great aerial activity is boing mani
fested on the Tvrolese front.
Claimed the Missouri Plat
form Will Be Followed In
National Affairs
Washington, May 20. President Wil
son will write the democratic plutform
to bo ncted on at the St. Louis con
vention, according to party leaders to
day. They said he would consult promi
nent members of the democratic organ
ization w hile so doing.
Sonntor Stone, of the foreign rela
tions committee, will aid in drafting the
foreign plank.
The plafform adopted In Missouri, it
is assumed, is practically a forecast
of the national platform so far as for
eign affairs are concerned. Missouri
endorsed the president's policy, snying
thut the United States had kept out of
the war. America's rights had been
forcefully championed, the policy of
non-intervention in Mexico hnd been
successful, while prompt nction follow
ed the border raids and the Monroe doc
trine was upheld.
The national platform is expected to
point with pride to the domestic accom
plishments of the administration, the
federal reserve system, the currency act,
the federal trades commission, tariff
reductions, rural credits, Alaskan rail
roads, army and navy increases and
amendments to the auti-trutt laws.
May Take Action to
Save the Oil fields
Washington, May 20" It was believed
ljkity today ithat President WiVon
mignt taKe action on tne request oi
Secretary Daniels, who wants him. to
save the naval oil reserves in the Cali
fornia fiolds.
A bill favorably reported by the sen
ate public lands committee provides
that entries made by private parties on
oil lands withdrawn from entry by
President Taft be made legal. If this
goes through Daniels informed the
president that the govprnment fuel re
serves would be seriously interfered
with.
The bill in question is backed by Hen
ator PtieJan, of California. Daniels
wants Wilson to use his influence
against it. He fears that the navy's
fuel eupply may become utterly ex
hausted it private firms gain a right
to take the oil.

The Democratic Ticket,
Tho democratic vote cast was par
ticularly light nt the election yester
day as William Galloway and T. A
Kinehart, candidates for circuit judge
in this district were the only names on
the ballot. The returns today in gen
eral, however, tend to show that Ma
rion county democrats preferred to
write in the mimes of republican onn
didutes instead of following the slate
adopted at the party convention. Grant
Corby, however, received the demo
cratic nomination for district attorney
with 122 votes out of 57 precincts,
while Max Gehlhar was vecond with
88.
Needham was the democratic prefer
ence for sheriff according to the count
from the precincts heard from today.
Mark Weutherford was the choice for
congress but the voto was so light in
most of the precincts that one of the
latter might cast a heavy vote for some
other man than the general party choice
and change the entire result. The par
ticular interest today in checking over
tho returns was in the republicnn race
and tho democratic nominees were con
tent to wait until the final count. The
numerous names written in and the
email voto made the counting of the
democratic ballots stow.
