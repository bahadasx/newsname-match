against German submarines had been
effectively renewed. According to

PRESIDENT AT
CELEBRATION
Mecklenburg Declaration of
Independence Is Honored by
Great Crowds at Char
lotte, North Carolina.
Charlotte, N. S.. May 20. President
Wilson today addressed a crowd esti
mated at more than 100,000 gathered
here for the ono hundred and forty
first anniversary of the signing of
the Mecklenburg declaration of Inde
pendence. He was introduced by Governor
Craig of North Carolina, who spoke
of the president as one of the greatest
leaders the nation has ever seen. The
president began speaking at 12:30
o'clock.
Ideals of United States.
The president spoko briefly and de
voted himself almost wholly to dis
cussion of tho ideals of the United
States. He declared "untainted
Americanism" was needed, and that
the United States must preserve its
ideals In order to be of assistance in
helping the world.
"I have come back for a brief visit
to a region dear to my heart," said
the president. "I do not know wheth
er I can interpret for you the spirit
of this occasion. It Is necessary to
realize just what we celebrate. There
were only threo million people In this
nation when It became independent.
Now there are 100,000,000 people.
There have been changes but we have
the same elements. What I want to
impress on you Is that we have al
ways ben in the making. Among the
men who founded this nation there
was a very great passion for human
liberty.
"This nation has devoted Itself al
most too much to material things.
There have been other nations just as
rich as the nited States. We must
think of what we are going to do with
our wealth and our prosperity.
"America did not corao out of the
south and it did not come out of Now
England. It came out of the middle
states, where there was a mixture of
different races."
The president spoke of the Euro
pean war.
"What are the elements of this
war?" he asked. "It 1b a clash of dif
ferent elements. Europe Is fighting
out iix-war the question wo are fight
ing out in peace. As the processes of
communication have grown better na
tions and peoples have grown closer
together. Men can now learn more
about each other. So that now the
melting pot is bigger than America.
It is as big as the world. See then
what a new world we have come Into.
"Here In America we have tried to
set the example of peace by keeping
togther. Isn't It the sign and dawn of
a new age that the one thing new on
which the world Is about to fall hack
is the moral judgment of mankind?"
Tho president said he hoped the
United States after the European war
would be able to lift up a symbol of
the "still, small voice of humanity."
Closing his address amid a burst
of applause the president left the
stand to go to a local club for lunch
eon. Charlotte, N, C, May 20. President
Wilson and his party arrived here at
10 a. m. to attend the celebration of
the Mecklenburg declaration of inde
pendence The president first re
viewed a procession and later made
an open air speech. Thousands from
all over tho state packed tho streets
and gave the president a great dem
onstration. At the reviewing stand
he was welcomed by Governor Craig
of North Carolina, Governor Manning
of South Carolina, and their staffs.
The procession, headed by the
North Carolina National Guards twenty-five
hundred strong, took an hour
to file by the point where the presi
dent stood. It was made up of not
only tho military but of industrial
floats and exhibits, veterans of the
civil war, fraternal orders and nu
merous other features representing
phases of southern life.
Wilson Addresses targe Crowd.
Salisbury, N. C, May 20. President
Wilson addressed a large crowd at
the railroad station here today as ho
passed through on his way to Char
lotte, attacked leaders of the Republi
can party as men who are "looking
backward." Members of the presi
dent's party declared he was referr
ing to the fight led by Senator Gal
llnger defeating the nomination of
George Rublee to the Federal Trade
commission.
"There are very serious things to
be done nowadays, ladles and gentle
men," said the president, "and it is
a satiBfactlon to be associated with
men who know how serious they are,
and with what spirit they must be ap
proached; because, whether wo will
or not, we are at tho beginning of a
new ago for the world, and America
will have to play a very groat part in
that new age. And we will have to
be very sure not to encourage or to
glvo countenanco to the men who aro
trying to hold ub back.
"There are some men, I do not be
lieve they represent the great rank
and file of the Republican party, but
the men who now control the Republi
can party, are looking backward, not
forward. They do not know the prob
lem of the new day, and whenever I, I
for example, try to show my sympa
thies for the forward-looking men of i
heir own party by nominating men of 1 1
' ' '
that sort, they at once try to block
the progress. They have no sympathy
with the 'forward-looking men of their
own party. Now I am for forward
looking men, not for backward-looking
men. We have come down here to
celebrate an historical episode, but
we have not done it because we are
looking backward; we havo done It
merely in order to give ourselves the
excuse to got together and feel tho
thrill of being Americans and living
in an age when it Is worth while be
ing Americans.
