Former New Yorker, Convicted in
Dublin, Was Alive last Night
SENTENCE NOT YET CONFIRMED
Message Recieved at State Depart
ment from Ambassador Page at
London.
Washington, May 20. Embassador
Tage at London cabled the -state de
partmcnt last night that the sentence
of Jeremiah C. Lynch, the naturalized
American convicted of complicity, in
the Dublin uprising, had not been coa
firmed, but that in accordance with
instructions from Secretary Lansing
the British government had been
asked to suspend the Infliction of any
punishment pending an investigation.
Acting Secretary Polk said the con
sul at Dublin would advise the state
department as soon as Lynch's sen
tence was known. He added that the
department yet remained without
knowledge of the fate of the prisoner
and other oiticials suggested that the
lack of information indicated that he
had not been executed.
Until this message came, there had
been no definite assurance that Lynch
was alive. Senator O Gorman in
formed President Wilson Thursday
night that he had been informed by
friends of Lynch in New York that
he was sentenced to bo shot at mid
night, New York time. Secretary
Lansing, at the president's direction,
dispatched at once instructions to kin
bassador Page to seek a reprieve
This was done at 9 o'clock, but it was
feared that the appeal might be too
late.
Embassador Page will inquire into
the case and upon his report will de
Dend any future steps in behalf of
Lynch. The American government can
only insist that no sentence be execut
ed until there has been a fair trial.

GOODRICH TIRE CO. WINS
Refused to Sell Leagues, Thus
Pro-
tecting Dealers.
The Goodrich Tire company in the
Unite v-'ates Hiatrw court in Cleve
land's h 31 was awarded a legal
victory a, he Automobile Co-
operative asso.
- "P America.
This suit was L.k
" the con-
sinners' league which c. id that the
Goodrich company's refusal to sell it
tires at dealers' prices was a conspir
acy in restraint of trade and that be
cause of the position taken by the
Goodrich company and other tire man
ufacturers tho association was forced
to go out of business.
The court, at the conclusion of the
evidence, decided that no damaged
were proven or could be recovered.
In l el using to sell to consumers'
leagues or similar organizations, the
Goodrich company claims it is acting
in defence of the supply houses of
which there are 75,000 in the country,
if the consumers' leagues were able to
purchase at jobbers' prices many of
these dealers, the Goodrich company
claims, would be forced to go out of
business.
This would, in the end, be a misfor
tune, not only to the individual dealer,
but would hurt every man who owns
and operates a car.
If you own a car yourself or if any
of your friends own a car and you take
your wives and children out for an all
day outing, one of the contributing
factors of your pleasure is the know
lodge that almost anywhere along the
road, if you ran out of gas, or if you
have a blowout, or if you need various
little supplies or assistance of any
kind, you can drop into a country gar
age or a little supply house and get
fixed up so that you will be able to
continue on your way rejoicing.
Tho Goodrich company states that
it will continue with its uniform and
long established policy, which has
been and is and will be to protect its
dealers, and refuse to sell at dealers'
prices to consumers under whatever
form of association they may be band
ed together.

ODD LABOR
SAVING
DEVICE.
Farmer'i Ingontiity With a Clock
and a Rat Trap.
On a farm in western New York It is
frequently necessary to shut off a gaso
line engine pump lute at night. The
pump Is located more than a mile from
the house, and th( owner, after many
weary midnight trips, decided to dele
gate the duty of shutting it olT to a
trusted familv nlanu cluck.
The clock wiis ilrst securely fastened
1o a support directly opimslte and
about a font uway from the switch of
the engine. One end of a short piece
of cord wai attached to the switch
and the other end tied firmly to the
winding pest on the back of the clock,
which revolves as the alarm rings.
The clock was set at the desired hour,
but Pistead of ringing It wound up the
cord on the revolving post, pulled open
the switch and stopped the pump.
The arrangement worked perfectly
except when the switch became clog
ged or jammed so that the mechanism
of tho clock was not sufllcientty strong
to pull It open. This difficulty was
remedied by bringing Into play an old
fashioned spring rat trap. The pull
of the clock is now ued to snap the
trap, and the strong throw of the imp
spring shuts off the current without
fail.
In another lnstanc an alarm clock Is
used to open the small slidins door of
a poultry house. In this ease the clock
winds up a strlm; connected with a bnl
anced weight. The pull of the string
causes the welirht to fall from its sup
port and as it falls It pulls up the slid
ing door. Country Gentleman.
Eggs That Can't Be Found.
The eggs of some common birds of

Frank Harrington, Farm Hand, Un

DENIES HE KILLED BOY
Inists Little Fellow Who Disappeared
From Home March 25 "Just
Died."
Albany, May 20. Frank Harrington,
forty-five years old, a roustabout farm
hand, was arrested yesterday by Detec
tive Eugene O. Bain as the slayer of
Hilly Clark, eight years old, whoso
body was found April 15 in the Pine
Bush woods. Police last night say they
were convinced they hud the right
man. Harrington denies killing the
boy and insiwts he "just died."
Harrington shivered and twisted in
a chair as he sat in police headquart
ers yesterday, recounting what he says
are the details of Billy Clark's actions
when he became lost on the Country
club road, March 25, a couple of hours
after he disappeared from a South
Pearl street moving picture theatre.
Harrington told of meeting the boy
In the road; of taking him to a shack
In Pine Hush; of keeping him there
three days, maltreating him, and. fin
ally, of throwing the body down into
the gullv in which the body was found.
He recited a well .connected story of
taking the boy's clothing "farther into
the woods," and then declared his only
fear now is that he will "die in the
electric chair."

But hold! The horse is behind the

the place of their nativity, and the
group of Islands took Its name from

enough, the name menus "big dog" In
stead of "little bird."
There was a time when these islands
were of tar more iut'Te.st and Impor

they called forth a special government
edict. It was the senate of Carthau'e
that passed a law forbidding the citi

From line.! immemorial the world
had believed that somewhere beyond

men happy, that they constituted the

BILLY ADELINE fl. WATERS
Aged Women's Clothing Causht
Fire From Gas Heater
ACCIDENT AT OLIN SCOTT HOUSE
Victim in Such Feeble Health Her
Sufferings Are Believed to Have
Been Brief.
Adeline If. Waters, aged 82, and a
lifelong resident of Bennington, was
accidentally burned to death between
7 and 8 o'clock this morning at the
Olin Scott residence on Pleasant
street now kept as a boarding and
rooming house by Miss Harriet Twlt
chfll. While Miss Waters was alone in her
room on the ground floor of the house,
it is plain that the accident was caused
by a gas heater, the aged woman's
clothing catching fire from the flame.
She was considerably burned about the
body, arms and face, and in the opin
ion of the physician who was sum
moned, death was due to the inhalation
of flame. The unfortunate victim cf
the accident had been in feeble health
for some time and it is probable that
her sufferings were of short duration.
It is possible that death may have re
sulted from shock at the discovery of
her danger.
t the time of the accident Miss
Waters was wearing a bathrobe and
judging from the position of the body
when found the must have tottered in
to a large wicker chair when she
realized that her clothing was afire.
Much of the robe was burned and the
chair was partially destroyed by fire.
According to the statement of Miss
Twitchell the accident happeued be
tween 7 13 and 7.40 o'clock. Miss Wat
ers had her breakfast as usual and re
tired to her nom at a quarter after
7. At 7.40 o'clock Miss Twitchell
alarmed by the smell of Kinoke, opened
the door of Miss Waters' room. Other
occupants of the house came to .Miss
TwitchoU's assistance but nothing
could be done as Miss Waters had
passed away before her condition was
discovered.
deline llarwood Waters was the
daughter of the late H Irani Waters and
Diailaniia llarwood Waters and was a
descendant of Peter llarwood, one of
the early settlers of Bennington. She
was a long-time member of the Old
First church at Old Bennington. For
years ishe sang in the choir of the
church. During her acHvo years she
was a teacher of music and numb -eil
among tier pupils many ot the young
people ot half a century ago. She was
a woman or high t hristian character,
beloved by all who knew her and the
news of her tragic end will be received
w ith sadness by a largo circle of ac
quaintances and close friends among
the older residents of this village and
Old Bennington. Miss Waters had
been living at the Olin Scott house for
about a year, coming from the Waters
home at Old Beiinigton where she had
previously lived.
The funeral will be held from the
Old First church at ;'. o'clock Monday
afternoon.

Shakespearian lines by amateurs, was
noticeably missing.
The leads were taken by Miss Elea
nor Murphy as "Rosalind ' and Edward
Jenney as ' Orlando '. Hie amount of
material which these two memorized
and delivered flawlessly caused much
com nit-nt among the COO parents,
teachers and friends present.
Miss Esther Thompson as "Celia"
delivered her lines with dainty expres
sion and good acting throughout. She
made an exceptionally pretty "Celia" in
both first and last acts, gowned in
white, and hair dressed in long golden
curb.
Edward Healy as "Touch Stone" and
Miss Irene Huss as "Audrey" supplied
the humor of the play. Healy spoke
his lines in simple, unet'fected manner,
with a touch of drawl which carried
off the part excellently. Miss Buss,
as Audrey, did not need to speak many
lines to bring out a laugh. Her make
up and natural ability to take a light
part brought several rounds of ap
plause. Kenneth Pauley as "Banished Duke-'
and Howard Esles as "Jaciiues'' spoke
their lines distinctly, the latter being
particularly good while reciting the
passage: The Seven Ages of Man.
Spencer Lee as "Amiens" sang two
solos dining the piece th v i. w ere en
cored. Other minor parts which were
well taken were "Frederick" by Wil
bur Lambert; "Oliver", by Theo Car
punter; "Adam," by William Arm
strong; "Corin." by Winchester Em
mons; "Silvins" by Raymond Percey;
William" by Roger Burt; "First
Lord,'' Channing Hare, ' Second Lord",
Carl Chase; "Phoebe," Ruth Mason.
The following took the part of the
boon companions of the "Banished
Duke:" Fred Beecher, William Lun-
dergan. Fail Hurley and Henry
Stickles.
All of the costumes worn were of tho
seventeenth century. They were made
by the gills' sewing classes under Miss
Margaret McLean's direction. Tho
spears and other propreties were made
by the boys in the manual training de
partment.
The play will be repeated in Shafts-
bury next week for the benefit of the
Shaftsbury school. The money made
from the performance here is to bo
ntlllzul to finance the local basket ball
team another season.
