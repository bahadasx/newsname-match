ADDED INTEREST
IN YELLOWSTONE
AUTOMOBILE TOUR
St. Paul, Minn., May 20.Added
interest in the sociability automo
bile tour to start from the Twin
Cities for Yellowstone park July 20
was injected yesterday by a letter
from Gen. Coleman du Pont, good
roads booster of New York, that he
expects to participate. This message
was conveyed to J. P. Hardy, secre
tary of the National Parks Highway
association.
That enthusiasm along the route
is rapidly taking definite form was
made clear by the route-marking
party now wending its way to Gar
diner, Mont. In cities passed through
where they have been feted they were
told that more than $100,000 will be
expended in highway betterment
work along the route during the next
two months.
After waddling around in rain
soaked roads for several days the
route-markers, in a Chalmers-six
car, last night arrived at Glendive, I
a few miles over the Montana line.
There they were taken in tow by
members of the Dawson County club
headed by President C. A. Thurston
and Frank Hughes, also a member of
the tour committee. With the party
the last two days were F. J. Toste
vin, publisher of a Mandan newspa
per, and W. W. Smith, of the Na
tional Highways association.
The trail-blazers caught their first
glimpse of the picturesque Yellow
stone valley as they entered Glen
dive and will follow it much of the
way to Gardiner. The last 64 miles
of the trip will be down the rock
ribbed canyon roads bordering this
stream, where the best scenery will
be found. B. O. Johnson and a party
representing the Commercial club of
Livingston will accompany the route
making crew into Gardiner. It is
expected that the pathflnding jour
ney will end Tuesday when the car
will be immediately returned to be
made ready for the trip over the
same route in July.

exhibitor play upon the passions of
the spectators, and so terrific is the
action, so intense the emotions
aroused that it is almost exhausting.
Swirl of Emotions.
"The spectator is swept along in a
swirl of emotions, and finds his
muscles tense, his nerves drawn.
"Viewed purely as a spectacle it is
stupendous-stunning in its magni
tude. Nothing approaching it has
yet been seen in motion .pictures.
There is nothing yet presented here
that even bears a comparison. For
once mob^scenes are convincing. As
a thffhdlejp of men in the mass, Mr.
Griffith has proven himself an artist
reproduce a battle of the Civil war.
Instead of it being ridiculous in its
ineffectiveness as might be expected,
it is most thrillingly realistic. It
amazes and awes. It is so over
Whelming that the spectator eveji for
gets to wonder at the mechanism of
the picture, and feels the thrill of the
scene.
Music Excellent.
"The spectacle is accompanied by
music from an orchestra of almost
symphony dimensions. The music
was composed with the one idea in
view, of accentuating the pictures,
and the timing is remarkable.
"The music and the spectacle com
bne to play upon the human passions
of love, hate and anger, and the re
sponse that they get is startling,
when the spectator has time to calmly
review his emotions.
"As photodrama it is gripping. If
a photodrama can be defined as 'a
story presented by a motion picture
camera for the entertainment of an
audience,' then 'The Birth of a Na
tion' fulfills that requirement wholly
and completely. Throughout the
tremendous spectacle the thread of
the story is never lost, and three
hours slip by like thirty minutes."
