Border Commander Reports Not
a Single Guard Organization
1$ Ready for Duty.
CALLED OUT 11 "DAYS AGO
Lack of Men and Equipment,
Bad Condition, and Refusal
- to Take Oath Are Causes.
The national guard has failed
utterly to meet the emergency for
which it was called to the Mexican
border, according to official re
ports to the War'Department from
General Funston.
Although ordered to the border
May 0, eleven days ago not a
single militia organization is ready
ifor duty General Funston reports.
General Funston telegraphed he
has been compelled to withdraw the
Sixth Cavalry from General Per
shing's column to do work of bor
der patrol, for which the national
guard was called out.
Some of the factors causing the
delay in mobilizing the militia, as
'outlined in General Funston's re
ports, are 'as follows:
CAUSES FOR DELAY.'
Shortage of men In skeleton organisa
tions reporting for border duty. Wdora
the paper strength called for 4,'CM men
'in the thrco State militias there will
be ler trmrrxxrnvaHaltirror' "fluty.
Shortage of equipment for men re
porting with mllltla. Although the War
Department furnished Texas, Arizona
and New Mexico with full equipment
for sixty-five men to a company, much
of this equipment was mining when
the men reported.
Failure of the militiamen to pass tho
physical examination required bpforo
they could be taken Into tho servico
of the United States. It was necessary
to relax the seerlty of the regulation
to avoid relcctlon of a largo percent
ace of militiamen.
Refusal of militiamen to take the oath
of allegiance In tho regular establish
ment when told they would be required
to serve If needed for the full period of
their enlistment.
Conflict between tho Federal Govern
ment and States becauao tho uniforms
and equipment, althdugh furnished by
the War Department, are the property
of the 8taten and compensation must
be tlxcd for them before their transfer
Is affected.
Tho necessity of filling up tho gaps
In mll'tary units, already skeletonized,
to make up for guardsmen rejected as
physically unfit or who refuse to take
the oath.
May Be Ready Next Week.
Gencial Funston believes that the
work of mobilizing the three Texas bri
gades will bo completed by the middle
of the week. It Is not certain whether
the Arizona nnd New Mexico regiments
will be rcadv then or not.
At the earliest, however, It will be fif
teen day after tho troops were called
out before they will be available for
service. In addition to this the gov
ernors of the three States had ten days'
notice to prepare for a call, and for
months previously tho militia organiza
tions were under orders to bo ready for
service when called.
Army officers said today that the slow
rate of mobilization for the three mllltla
organizations on the border It would
take one month to two months to get
any large body of militia from the
Northern or Kos'ern States mobilized
for the Mexican campaign
Tho War Department announced to
day that, while the National Guard has
failed to come up to expectations, the
recruiting campaign under the Hay
resolution of March 15 to Inciease the
army to war strength by adding 10,000
men is progressing rnpmiy.
in the last week mere were 7Z8 re
cruits enlisted out or 3,23 applicants.
In the slxty-ffvc days of the recruit
ing campaign the army has gained 6,718
new recruits, out of 30,281 applicants.
Most of the new recruits hao been
sent to the Mexican border to be In
corporated Into regiments on border
patrol duty. The regular army "rook
ies," therefore are available for border
patrol work where the mllltla organiza
tions are still In process of mobiliza
tion. Ready for Inquiry
Into Wire Tapping
NEW YORK, May JO.-Wlth the of
flclal investigation into New York's
wlie-tappIng scandal, held over until
-Monday, when the Thompson committee
will again convene, District Attorney
bwann today is gathering together all
the shreds of evldcnco so far adduced,
with an eye to criminal prosecution,
If the facts warrant.
He now has the documentary evidence
brought nut before tho committee.
Statements that the wire-tapping was
done In the Interests of an Important
Federal Investigation, as asserted by
1'ollce Commissioner Woods and Mayor
Mltchel were confirmed In a statement
Jssuen hv United States District Attor
ney 11 Snow den Marshall,
He said the I'nlted States Government
was Interested In the tapping of the
wires to the 8emour & Sevmnur office,
and that publication of tho ficts now
would be a hindrance to the administra
tion of JusUce.
Troops in Big Bend
To Be Withdrawn
Colonel Sibley Believes His Task
of Dispersing Bandits Has
Been Accomplished.
BAN ANTONIO, May 20. Withdraw
al of the second American expedition
from Mexico to Boqulllas will be ac
complished In a few uj's.
Colonel Blbley believes his mission of
dispersing the bandits who raided
Iioqulllas nnd Glenn Springs has been
accomplished, and he has notified
headquarters of his Intention to re
turn to the border.
For this reason, the 8lxth Cavalry,
which withdrew from the first expedi
tion jesterday, will bo utilized as a Big
UerTd patrol instead of re-enforcing the
first expedition.
Reports today showed that In the re
cent brush of the second expedition
with tho Mexicans four bandits were
wounded and two captured.
Thoy had held ns prisoner a Carranza
commander's son, thus showing that
they were not allied with the Uarran-clstas.
Confirmation of Colonel Sibley's Inten
tion to return from Mexico to the bor
der reached the War Department today.

Early Figures Give Jurist More
Votes Than Bpth Burton and
Cummins.
PORTLAND, Ore.. May 20.-Charles
E. Hughes, of New York, Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States,
was the overwhelmlni choice of the Re
publicans of Oregon as Presidential
nominee, on the face of early returns
today from yesterday's State-wide
Presidential preference primary.
Scattering Incomplete returns from
twelve counties Indicated that Hughes
had carried the State over Durton of
Ohio and Cummins of Iowa with a
tremendous majority. These returns
Indicated that the New Yorker had re
ceived more votes than Burton and
Cummins combined.
.Early figures give Hughes 8,693: Cum
mins, 3.890: Burton, 1.865.
It is estimated that 60 per cent of
the total registration of 50.000 had
been oast at the primary. The count
promised to be very alow.
On the Democratic side, President
Wilson had no, opposition.
.Cummins and Burton were active can
dldntes. Both did some campaigning In
the State. Hughes was a candidate
against his own wishes.
Ho askod the Secretary of State to
take his name from the ballot, but the
Supreme Court decided that the official
was not compelled to honor the request,
and If remained, because the petition
of nomination was signed by 1,300
voters.
Hughes Not Excited
By Oregon Returns
Justice Hughes today received with
out apparent excitement news of his
oerwhelmlng triumph In the Presiden
tial primaries in Oregon.
His secretary announced, when the
returns were read to him, that there
would assuredly be no expression from
the Justice, and that it could not even
be said he was Interested.
Republican leaders who believe they
have control of the coming Republican
convention, however, took an entirely
different view of the situation.
"Hughes against the field," was the
expression of one prominent Senator,
and ho added that the only figure In
"tho field" who could be regarded as
more than a favorite son, since the
beating given Cummins and Burton in
Oregon, was Colonel Roosevelt.
Because of the falluie of the forces
friendly to Roosevelt In Pennsylvania
to do better than break even, that
well, with Penrose, the Justice was
declared a leader over the Colonel,
In the face of incomplete returns
In Oregon, Cummins and Burton fol
lowers made no formal statements. It
Is known, however, both had deter
mined to stake almost all on a chance
of becoming a national, rather than a
local candidate, by a defeat of Jus
tice Hughes In a contest where pop
ular sentiment had full play.
What appealed to the party leaders
here was that the voters of Oregon
had plainly preferred Hughes to
either the Progressive Cummins or
the conservative Burton. They re
garded this symptom as bearing out
their own convictions that Hughes
Is the most available middle-ground
candidate
Hughes' strength In the Vermont
primaries, where his name was written
In on ballot more than twice an often
an any other candidate. Indicated to
these leaders, too, that his strength is
not confined to the pregresslve Btates of
tho West.
Wall Street Expects
Hughes to Be Nominee
NEW YORK, May 20. Justice Charles
B. Hughes Is looked upon by Wall
Street as the coming opponent of Presi
dent Wilson, said the Wall Street
Journal, editorially, today.
"In 1909, Hughes was not popular In
Wall Street" continued the editorial.
"Now he Is tremendously popular, not
because his friends outnumber the
friends of Rllhu Root, but because
friends of both believe that Hughes can
win.
"It was Mr. Hughes who dlctatod
teima to Wall Street In 1909. Slowly
these terms were accepted, and now,
when Wall Street Is flourishing und'ir
speculation. It Is conceded that Hughes
was right In 1900, and that he would be
a good man to have In the White
House."
Colonel Is Pleased
With DetroitAddress
NEW YORlV, May 20. Jf outward
signs are Indicative, Colonel Roosevelt
was very well satisfied today over the
reception accorded his speech at De
troit on "Righteous Peace Through Pre
paredness" the title being that officially
given the address by Progressive head
quarters. The colonel passed gesticulating
through a crowd at the railroad sta
tion, bustled Into his automobile and
was hurled off to Oviter Bay for a rest.
He had nothing to say for publication
regard'ng his day In Henry Ford's home
town, but It waa evident he was very
well pleased.

DISTRICT BUDGET TO
GET RIGHT OF WAY
IN HOUSE MONDAY
Littel Opposition 'Expected to
Provision Doing Away With
Half-and-Half Plan.
RULE IS SOUGHT ON RIDER
Page to Attempt to Prevent Any
Point of Order Against
Amendment to Bill.
The District of Columbia appropr'a
tlon bill with Its rider which In effect
repeals the half-and-act principle of
the act of 1S7S. wjll take the right of
way In the Houso Monday1.
There Is today little likelihood that
any determined fight will be made
aralnst the provisions which require
that all District revenues shall be ex
hausted before the contribution of the
Federal Government to tho District's
upkeep shall begin.
Congressman Robert N. PHge. who
will be in charge or the District
budget, expects to get a rule from
the Itujee commlttco on Monday that
will make In order this legislative
rider nnd alt other legislation in the
Dlstilct bill. Such n rub) will pre
vent the making of a point of older
against any legislative paragraph on
the ground that It I out of place on
an appropriation measure.
Little Opposition.
"I do not anticipate much opposition
tothe proposal that the Federal Gov
ernment shall begin to contribute only
after the District's revenues for tho
next vear shall have been exhausted,"
said Mr. Page today. "This provision
compiles with the spirit of the report
of thr Jol'tt fiscal committee which In
vestglated the half-and-half controversy
during the past summer. Of course if
the HoiiKe is dissatisfied with tho
amount appropriated from the Federal
Treasury It may amend and Increase
the Federal contribution."
Congressman Henry T fRalney, rank
ing Democrat of the House members of
the Joint F.stal Committee, said today
that he regarded the District budget as
cne that carries out tho recommenda
tions of the Joint committee. It Is un
derstood tiat both Mr. Ralnev and Con
gressman Card, the two- Democratic
members ofthe flhcal Inquiry commit
tee, will make speeches supporting tho'
D.strict bill as reported by the Appro
priations committee.
Question Apart.
Mr. Ralncy snys that the question of
assessment and taxation here' Is apart
from the appropriation bill for the next
fiscal year. This may be taken up later
he asserts. If there Is any unfairness to
ward the District,
A slmalar posllon was taken by Con
gressman Cooper, Republican member
of the Fiscal Committee. Mr. Cooper,
however, thinks the Federal contrfhu
t'onj should be most liberal, and indi
cated that he would, seek to amend thu
bill to take care of more projects than
ao proposed now.
As the appropriation bill now stands
tho District revenue.-! which are used
up In the btl, amount to more than
ts.000,000. while the Federal Government
"chips in" to the extent of slightly
more than $3 000 000. The proportion of
contribution Is 70 per cent for the Din
trice government and 30 per cent for the
Federal Government.
Additional Marines
To Santo Domingo
Force of 300 Ordered From Nor
folk Navy Yard Others From
Haiti If Necessary.
Secretary of the Navy Daniels has
ordered 300 marines from Norfolk to re
enforce the army of marlnrs sent to
suppress the Santo Domlngan revolu
tion. The Norfolk marines will be Bnt
on tho cruiser Tennessee. The cruiser
Salem has been ordered from Boston
with a small foice of marines. Rear
Admiral Caperton his been given au
thority to move between 4C0 and 600
marines from Haiti to Santo Domingo.
This will give him u force of neaily
3 000 available for any necessary ser
vice In the Dominican republic.
Admiral Caperton advised tho Navy
Department that ho landed 00 marines
nt Santo Domingo fty Monday. The
.revolutionists retired from the city.
The revolution In Santo Domingo was
organized by Qeneial Arias In an at
tempt to overthrow the admlnlsttntion
of President Jlmlnex. The latter has
been forced to rnslgn nnd Is now await
ing trial of Impeachment proceedings.

reason for giving the cert'flcates to
Messrs. Miller and Chase."
Immediately upon receiving notice
of the election's board action, Julius
I. Peyser, an alternate on the Hogan
Wllllston ticket, said:
"We do not fear defeat from such
tactics ss the election board is pur
