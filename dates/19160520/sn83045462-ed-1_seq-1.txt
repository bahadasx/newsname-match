CHARLOTTE. X. C. May 20.?Prest
dent Wilson, speaking to a vast crowd
of nmrf than lOO.ano people here today
for the c'ebri' tion of the 141st anniversary
of the signing of the Mecklenburg
declaration of independence, deviated
!?* hoped the I'nited States,
after the European war. would he able
to lift up a symbol of the "still, sma'l
voice of humanity."
The President expressed the hope
that out of the present war may come
an amalgamation of the peoples and
th- interests of the world which will
i bring them into a common melting pot.
Ii ventured the hope that after the
i>:->ent whi al! peonies might come
loget her.
The President asked. "What are you
gorng t?? do with your power?" He incjuired
whether "you are going to
Transform it into forte or peace?" He
added that the world now is about to fall
l?a? k upon its moral consciousness.
Discusses Ideals of United States.
The President spoke only briefly and
honsclf almost wholly to dis<
us. ion i?f the ideals of the United
States. He declared "untainted American*,
m is needed. He declared the
United States must preserve its ideals
in order to he of assistance in helping ]
the world. He was enthusiastically ap-!
tolauded.
"I have come hack for a brief visit to 1
a region dear to my heart." said the
President. '"I do not l.now whether I
Un interpret for you the spirit of this
?? . asion. It is necessary to realize just
t what we celebrate.
"There were only 3,00ft.000 people iri
nation when it became independent.
Now there are 100.000.000 people. There
have been changes, but we have the
same elements. What I want to irn,
piess on you is that we have always
het-n in the making. Among the men
who founded this nation there was a
ver\ great passion for human liberty.
Cites Fault ot Nation.
"What I want to call your attention
t" that this nation has devoted itself
a;ir t too much to material things.
There have been other nations just as
i ;<-ii as the United States. We ir.ust
think of what we are going to do with
our wealth and our prosperity.
"America did not come out of the
south and it did riot come out of New
England. It came out of the middle
elates, where there was a mixture of
different races."
The President dwelt on the Kuropean '
w a r.
"What are the elements of this war?" i
h? asked. "It is a clash of different1
elements. Europe is fighting out in I
war the questions v. e are fighting out1
in peace.
Whole World Now a Melting Pot. '
"As the processes of communication
have grown better nations and peoples :
have grown closer together. Men can J
now learn more about each other. So :
that now the melting pot is bigger than
America. it i? as leg as the world.
See then what a new world we have;

OPPOSE ABOLITION j

Senators of Both Political

House District Bill.
j _

SHOULD SHARE EXPENSE,
i
Friends of Local Government to
Labor for Continuance of
Present System
Dissatisfaction with the House District
appropriation bill and the means
adopted in that measure for doing away
j with the half-and-half principle of ap
j propriating for the District is growing:
j among senators the more they study
j the measure'. Prediction was made toi
day by democrats and republicans
alike that an effort would be made in
the Senate to restore the half-and-half
plan. and. failing that, to specify in
direct terms that the federal government
should bear its share of the upi
keep and building of the National Capi
ital.
| "I have always been opposed to do!
ins away with the organic act. or that
part of it known as the half-and-half
; plan.' said Senator Chamberlain of
[Oregon, today. "I think the House
bill as framed at present justifies this
| position of mine. I believe firmly that
i the? national government should bear
its full share of building up and
beautifying the capital, and I do not
think that 50 per cent is too much for
ilie government to pay as its share.
The taxes here are just as high as
they are in my state, and I do not
think it would be fair to the people of
the District to place the heavy burden
of making the Capital city what it
should be, the pride of the country,
upon them."
Views of Senator Jones.
Senator Jones <>? Washington, a member
of the Senate appropriations committee,
who has been much interested
| in having the National Capital made
| beautiful and worthy of the entire
i country, said he did not believe that at
j any time the share, of the government
j should fall below 50 per cent of the exI
penditures, and that frequently, when
large improvements were needed, it
would run much above 50 per cent. 1
*1 think that the federal government
should bear its full share of the burden
of building up the capital," he said. "1
j have talked throughout my own state
I about the city of Washington, and in
no instance did I find the people opposed
to a liberal treatment of the capital
by the federal government." ?
Duty of Federal Government.
Senator Sterling of South Dakota
said that he had feared very much that
some such action as that taken by the
House appropriations committee would
follow the report of the joint select
committee of Congress. He said that
i he thought the people of Washington
(should pay a fair and reasonable tax,
and that the federal government should
I do its full share. He added that he
thought it very probable that there
would be an effort In the Senate to replace
the half-and-half plan in the I
law. j,
i The House committee, in framing--ihe |
District hill, he suggested had gone ,
a long way to disgust those members
of the Senate who believed that by do- j
! i 11 away with the half-and-half plan a J
better system might be evolved for ;
j paying the expenses of the District.

Increasing Activity.
J Recent reports from Honolulu have
j indicated gradually increasing activity j
in Haiemaurnau, the fire pit of Kilauea
The fire, which has sunk to a depth or
several hundred feet and was barely
visible some time ago from the edge of
the pit, has been slowly rising. The
i crater has not overflowed for more
| than a generation, but frequently the
! molten lava is almost flush with the
j edge of the pit. The last time the
I- rater overflowed the stream of lava
! stopped only a short distance from
j Hiio, about thirty miles distant,
j Mukeweoweo, the crater of Mauna
I boa nearly at the summit of the moun- j
| tain, which is more than 13,000 feet !
; high, has not been extremely active
for several years. The last eruption,
about seven years ago, sent streams j
of lava down the side of the mountain
and almost to the sea on the J
southern side of the island. ;
Kilauea is known as the most easily I
accessible volcano in the world, it be- I
ing possible t<> drive an automobile to !

GERMANS ARE FORCED
TO RETREAT IN AFRICA j
: i
PARIS, May HO. The forced retreat j
: of German forces in German East ,
I Africa is announced in an official re- |
port just issued by the Belgian war
department at Havre. The report also
claims the taking of a highly orj
ganl%ed German defensive position and
the capture of a 77-millimeter gun.
j The text of the report Is as follows:
"Our operations in Ruanda are developing
satisfactorily. Their communications
are threatened both by
the occupation of Kigali and by the
advance of a Belgian <olumn south of
Rake Kivu and. strongly pressed by our
troops north of the lake, the German
forces have retreated
"Gen. Tombeur occupied on -May 12
the Mount Kama range, which the enemy
had converted into a powerful defensive
barrier. A 77-mlJlimeter gun
fell into our hands."
GERMANS THRUST
AT BRITISH LINE!
Attempt to Cross Yser Cana
North of Ypres Reported
to Have Failed.
SECTOR LOGICAL POINT
FOR DRIVE UPON CALAIS
Ieutonic Gas Attack in Champagni
Declared to Have Proven
Fruitless.
LONDON, May 20.?With oomparativ
quiet prevailing at Verdun, the Ger
mans last night made a thrust at th>
British lines in Flanders, attemptini
10 cross the Yser canal north of Ypres
The French war office, which report
the attempt, declares that it failed.
The sector picked for the attack i
one that would naturally be chosen b;
the Germans for an effort to break thi
British front and drive toward Calais
Some of the fiercest fighting of th
war has taken place along the Yse
during previous German attempts t<
advance toward the English cannel.
Activity has also been displayed t>:
the Germans in other sectors of tin
western front, notably in a gas at
tack in the Champagne region, whicl
is also declared to have been fruitless
Vrannk f nrr* w. .1i ?? ~ ~
The French statement follows:
"In Belgium groups of enemy troop*
attempted to cross the Yser canal be
tween Steenstraete and Het Sas. Thej
were checked by infantry and artillery
fire.
"In Champagne the Germans discharged
flense clouds of gas along oui
front on the road between St. Hilaln
and St. Souplet and on the Souain
Somme-Py road.
"Our cut tain of fire made it impossi
hie for the enemy to launch an at tad
which he had prepared.
"West of the .\leuae (Verdun front
there was a violent bombardment fluting
the night against our position:
between Avocourt wood and Dead Mar
hill. There was no infantry attack.
"In the Vosges an attack was made
on one of our small listening posts.
' German Fliers Broug-ht Down.
"Sub-Lieut. Navarre brought dowr
yesterday his eleventh German aeroplane.
It fell within our lines at
Chattancourt, and the two occupants
were captured. Another German aeroplane
was attacked by Sub-Lieut. Nurigesser
anfl crashed down in the Bets
forest. It was the fifth aeroplane
brought down by this officer. Three
other German aeroplanes were hit 1>>
our fire and were seen to fall verti
tany in me merman lines.
"German aviators during the night
threw many bombs on Dunkirk and
Bergues. At Dunkirk a woman was
killed and twenty-seven persons wore
wounded. At Bergues five persons
were killed and eleven wounded. It
reprisal a French squadron set fortli
immediately to bombard -enemy cantonments
at Wywege, Zarren and
Handzaeme. A Belgian squadron bombarded
the aviation establishment a1
Ghistelles. The greater part of the
bombs reached their mark."
Trie text of today's German statement
follows:
"In the Argonne German patrols
penetrated the enemy's second line
after a few explosions. They observed
great losses in killed and wounded in
the enemy's positions and returned with
n few prisoners.
"Repeated attacks upon our newly
gained positions on both sides of the
Uaucourt-Esnes high road were again
easily repulsed.
"Five enemv aeronlanes were broucht
lown, one by our infantry fire southeast
of Vailly. the other four in aerial
battles near Aubreville on tlie southern
edge of the Hessen wood near Avoourt
and due east of Verdun.

British Gain Position.
It develops tiiat the action of thr
British battalior/s of the Loyal North
Lancashires and the Lancashire Fusiliers
or; the loth was a singularly bril
liant attack, and gained a strategic
point? the crest of the redoubtable
Vitny ridge?th?- possession of which
means the command of the plain ol
Lens.
.Since the British took over this section
from the French, in the early stage
of the battle of Verdun, the (iermans
had been holding stubbornly the vantage
of the higher ground and inflicting
heavy casualties on the British
After a successful exposion of mines
just after dark, the Lancashires, whc
are made up largely of cotton operatives
from Manchester, rushed frorr
their trenches to the lins of the
ers.
Every detail in the program of the
operation was carried out successfully
Morning: found the Dancashires thoroughly
intrenched against a retaliatory
German bombardment and had connected
their old line by communicating
trenches six feet deep. Slight casualties
were the cost of the night's success.
The value of the ground gained
is not to be Judged by the 360 yards
of front taken, but by the fact that th?
Lancashires are no longer on the dowr
side of the slope with the Germans
above them.

American Embassy Told An-1
i j
nouncement Will Be Made
I i
During Day.
| LONDON", May 20.?The American
embassy was officially Informed today
j | that sentence on Jeremiah C. Lynch, the
M naturalized American who lias been
j convicted of complicity in the Sinn
Fein revolt in Ireland, would be anf
nounced by the military authorities
during the day.
Henry W. Massingham. editor of the
Nation, in a letter written from Dublin,
where he has been investigating
conditions, arrives at the conclusion
that, although the revoit itself was
imperfectly developed the emotional J
reaction may become a serious problem
[ for British statesmanship. He asks the
j question how it has arisen that the
I Sinn Fein revolt finally earned the
I sympathy from the Irish people, who
in the hour of its start fiercely con- ;
j demned i?.
Appeal to Romantic Spirit.
Massingham thinks that the psychic |
{<|tialit>* of the revolt, the disinterested-j
! I.ess of its leaders, their reckless sur
render of life and fortunes and their'
gallantry in the face of death and de,
feat, naturally appeals to the martial V
J and romantic spirit ?>f the people, but
Jit was the executions and the errors
j of the military administration, which
I fell with indiscriminatlng hand on the s
j innocent arid guilty alike, that have !f
j changed the perspective and the his
torical significance of the revolt in f
the minds of the Irish people.
' The Irish Judges have resumed their j
I sittings in the four courts which have t
| been closed for an extra long Easter
(recess, owing to the rebellion. Except
i for a few large holes in one of the
outer walls, caused bv gunfire during
(the rebellion, the building shows few I
'traces of having been occupied by the .1
i rebels. Sentries with fixed bayonets
-still guard the building. S

U-18 SANK THE SUSSEX*
?
United States May Make Another ^
Inquiry as to German Punish- J
ment of Commander.
h
V
i Information received by the State De1
partment from entente sources and
made known for the first time today is
that the German submarine U-18, com- 4
manded by Lieut. t)tto Steinbrink, was h
the submersible which destroyed the Q
channel liner Sussex and brought the v
crisis between the United States and ^
Germany to a climax. ^
Ambassador Gerard has not replied to
the State Department's inquiry regarding
the nature of the punishment imposed
upon the commander as promised
by Germany. Another inquiry may be
made.
"The identity of the submarine which
sank the Sussex was said in dispatches
to the State Department to have been
obtained from the crew of another German
submarine captured by allied war
vessels.
News dispatches from Paris soon
after the Sussex was torpedoed said
the submarine commander had been
deoorated by Emperor William.

SHORTAGE IN U. S. FLAGS.
GERMANY CHIEF SOURCE AND
SHIPMENTS HAVE BEEN
SUSPENDED.
American patriotism will suffer somewhat
this year because Germany cannot
ship to this country a sufficient quantity
of small United States flags. This unusual
situation was discovered here when
a committee representing all the departments
of the federal government endeavored
to buy a large number of small
silk flags for a Flag day celebration in
this city.
A patriotic demons traticn had been
proposed, and every employe of the government
was to wear a si#all flag in his
coat lapel. When the committee asked
for prices on the required number of
little flags it was informed by the
inhh?r? tllOt all flor-e aro
in Germany" and that the war has cut
off shipments As a result the scheme
has been abandoned, as the committee
has not found any American firm which
is in the business of making small
American flags.

now goes to the Senate.
Republicans who yesterday delayed ,
the vote by offering more than a hun- |
dred amendments made no further at- t
tempt to amend the measure. Demo- c
cratic Leader Kitchin and others who
opposed the bill last year were won to i
its support by the clause limiting gov- ,
ernment operation of ships to five years t
after the close of the war. (

A filibuster conducted by Republican x
Leader Mann halted the passage of the <
bill, which had been scheduled for last
s
evening. t
Representative Mann demanded teller .?
votes on many of the hundred or more j
amendments offered by Republicans, j
and when a final- vote on the measure <
itself was about to he taken he insisted (
that the formality of reading the en- ,
grossed bill be observed. As the bill
had not been engrossed, there was nothing
to do but adjourn.
Larly in the day. while The House
was in the committee of the whole, the .
republicans succeeded in striking out
the section providing for the purchase 1
of ships by the government, but this j
was restored by the House itself.
Immediately after the passage of the
