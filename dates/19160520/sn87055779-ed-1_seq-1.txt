today with matters, so far as the ac

faced the weak, w hite-faced prisoner
as ho took his seat this morning and
prepared to watch another day of
weary rpiestioning eif tale mien.
The first week of the trial has had
a noticeable effect on the voting cul-
' legian. The half del'.ance that mark
ed his actions the first day has larpe
1 disappeared and in its stead has
settled a sort of apathetic despair as
he watches the sturdy Iake county
farmers evade jury duty by telling
the court they have an unalterable
opinion as to his guilt or innocence.
The "sensation fans" that crowd
the little court room every day had
a choice morsel to mull over today.
It became known that Celeste
Youker, the yirl for whose love Or
pet is, said to hive thrown over
Marian lmibert. has visited him in
his narrow cell in the county jail.
The visit is said to have been made
i n Thursday night, hut it has been
j kept a secret.
. .Miss Youker is said t have pro
j tested her belief in his innocence.
( and some of the court gossip even
j had her vowing she would marry

shook his head as he pointed to his

ing him have forbidden him to talk
e.f his case in any way, and he is

SAX ANTONIO, Texas, May 20.
Gen. Funston will hatten the rear
rangement of American troops on
the border in anticipation of new
attacks by Mexican bandits, encour
aged by the withdrawal of part of
Gen. Pershing's expedition and the
spreading of reports in Mexican
territory that the "gringoes" have
been driven hack.
The general was disappointed to
day when he learned that the return
of the 6th cavalry to Columbus had
been made public. His intention
was not to announce this movement
until the troopers had reached their
base in the Big Bend district, where
coast artillery forces are also being
sent.
i:i PASO, Texas. May 20. Troops
of the HJtli United States infantry
have been ordered out of Mexico to
take tin border patrol duty and
I within a few days will follow the
6th cavalry back across the interna
tional boundary line. This was
learned today with the 6th cavalry
camped at Columbus awaiting the
'orders that will take It into the Iiig
Bend district.
The Ianghorne-Sibley expedition
is also coming back to the border.
Maj. Lfcinghorne's weary riders after
going 135 miles into Mexico, drew
back to Kl Pino, 70- miles from the
border, and effected a junction -with
Col. Sibley's main force. As soon
as scattered detachments arrive at
El Pino the return to the border
will begin.
The fact that so many American
troops are leaving Mexico has al
ready encouraged the Villistas and
the long-sought "Pancho" himself is
reported to have taken the field
again in the district around Farral
and Chihuahua. To this fact is at
tributed a sudden tightening of the
military censorship at Columbus.
WASHINGTON, May 20. Condi
