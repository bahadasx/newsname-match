Save California Oil
Fields to Supply Our
Ships, Pleads Daniels
If Proposed Reclamation of
Must Return to Coal as
Would Put Many Ships Out of Commission and Reduce
w wRpattiAnd Steaming Radius of Dreadnaughts.
WASHINGTON, May- 19. Secretary Daniels" appealed to President Wil
son today to use his influence to save the navy's reserves in the Cali
fornia oil fields as a vital step in the campaign for adequate nutional defense.
Should the bill favorably be reported by the senate public lards commit
tee to legalize certain entries on lands withdrawn by President Taft ir 190S
become law. Mr. Wilson was told the nay must abandon oil fuel und return
to coal with a consequent loss In xteuming radius am! vipeed to its ships.
Navy designers have advised tho secretary that It would be unsafo to con
tinue construction of oil-burning battle crift unless an adequate reserve
supply of fuel was in sight.
Mr. Daniels submitted a full summary of the situation and the president
begun studying the problem Immediately, as the bill probably will be taken
up next week.
Would l'lay Havoc.
In laying the mater before the
president Mr. Daniels repeated state
ments he made to the senate com
mittee while the bill was under con
sideration, pointing out that a naval
vessel built to burn oil cannot he con
verted to a coal-burccr without prac
tically rebuilding her, and that the
navy relied upon this reserve oil
when the policy of oil burning bat
tleships was adopted.
"If tho navy is forced to depend
entirely upon a commercial supply of
oil," be said, "the tucl cost of the
fleet 's certain to be very great, ond
It is possible that in time of great
need (he efficiency of the navy may
be Impaired by an inadequate sup
ply of fuel oil.
.Mr. Daniels also expiainea tnai
navy designers a 13 said the possi
bility of attaining a 3S-Knot speed
for the battle cruisers now being de
signed, as well as for scout cruisers
and detroyer., depends entirely upon
oil fuel. Willi coal fuel it is doubt
ful, the experts agree, whether more
than 50 Knots can -lie attuined by
battle cruisers, and even that with a
greatly reduced cruising radius.

WANT MANY HANDS
TO GATHER HARVEST
Farmers Kesmndlng Slowly, Hut
Labor Officials ExM-ct lo
Supply Demand.
Sprriul to Tha World
OKLAHOMA CITY. Muy 19 Al
though farmers are responding slowly
to letters sent out from the office of
W. G. Asbton, state lubor commission
er, relative to the furnishing of har
vest hands, little trouble is expected
this year in the matter of supplying
the lubor demands In the state. The
proposition of supplying harvest hunds
was begun this year on a much more
conservative basis than lust. And in
this respect the movement this year
Is somewhat disappointing. Fanners
were asked to inform the labor com
missioner by card us to I lie number
of men thut might be needed. Five
thousund of these cards were mulled
out. Sonic seven hundred farmers
have responded. After having given
the farmers an opportunity to secure
assistance from bis office in the way
of getting belli, the commissioner bus
decided to let the matter rest with
the farmers, except that ho will aid
them when called upon.
I.lllle Trouble.
Edgar S. Fenton, president of the
Ktute Federation of Labor, believes
there will not be the trouble expe
rienced lust year in the labor demands
for tho stuto during the summer. The
most trouble lust year was that with
the members of the Industrial Work
ers of the World. They mobilized at
Enid and after bolng unsuccessful in
getting work because there were too
many of them, they rioted and de
manded that the city feed them. It
was necessary to use a few of the local
militia company to restore peace. In
judicious advertising for harvest
hands was the chief cause of the trou
ble. This will not be repeated this
yea r.
Late reports show thut oats have
Buffered tremendously and there will
probably be little of them cut. Wheat
has been damuged considerably and
the continued cool, wet weather re
tards ripening process and has caused
rust In a good many places. It is
possible that harvest will not begin
until late In June or the first of July.

FIND MYSTERY III
DEATH OF WIGGS
Coroner's Jury Failed to
Upturn a Verdict of
Death by Own Hand.
ORDER INVESTIGATED
One Bullet Found in Skull
but Head Had Been
Crushed Completely,
A CORONER'S Jury sitting In the
justice court of Lee Iunlel yes
terday afternoon injected mystery In
to the death of Jordan Wiggs. who
it was thought, killed hicself In his
homo ut Wt.kiwa Thursday, rather
than submit to arrest on a charge of
assault with Intent to kill. The jury
retiirnd a erdict in which they
found Wiggs came to his death by
being struck on the head with a blunt
Instrument In the hands of a party or
parties unknown or ny gunshot wound
und recommended that the county
authorities Investigate the case thor
oughly.
Suspicions of the officers ond the
county attorney orrice were attract
ed to the theory of foul play when an
examination of the wound In Wlgg's
head disclosed that it was a large Jag
I'cd tear not such as a 32 calibre bul
let was likely to produce. Another
unusual thing was that the bullet had
bpen fired almost directly on top of
the head, an unusually difficult posi
tion for a person hold a revolver.
Autopsy Ordered. i
An autopsy was ordered by Assist
ant County Attorney Kd Warren, fol
lowing a visit to Wiggs' home. This
was performed yesterday arternoon
and It was found that u bullet had
plowed Its way deep into the skull,
but had been broken Into three pieces.
There was no trace of powder burns
and It was found the skull had been
crushed In nine places
N. J. Cuteti the man whom WiKgs
attempted t kill Tuesday, and who
escaped only t.y iisinir postmaster t . t:
Wallace as u shield, testified yester
day at the inouest that he was within
four hundred feet of Wiggs' home
when he heard a shot. He said he
wns watching the house to see that
Wiggs did not get away before deputy
sheriffs arrived to arrest him on a
rharcc of assault with Intent to kill,
which he had preferred.
The doctor who terformed the au
topry, declared It would be practically
impossible for a small bullet to tear
such a hole, In a skull. He testuiea
that persons who commit suicide by
shooting themselves usually have the
gun clinched In their hand, while the
run WigKS was supposed to have de
stroyed himself with was found lying
apart from Ihe body.
Had Watched Him.
Wallace. Cutes and a man named
Harry Orr. declared they had been
watching Wiggs" home when they
heard a Hhot. Officers were on their
way to th3 scene when the news
reached here. All of the curtains
were pulled down and the doors were
locked. It was necessary to enter the
house through a window.
Cates said trouble occurred between
him and Wiggs two years ago when
they had a dispute regarding a land
deal. Shortly after Wiggs attacked
him with a dirk Ju tt as he was board
ing a train. Cates knocked him down
with a club. Nothing further was
heard of the trouble until Wiggs
drew a shotgun on Cates.
A thorough Investigation has been
ordered by ihe county attortey.
Wiggs was f8 years old and a
bachelor. He had lived in Wekiwa
for the past three years, where he
worked as a carpenter. A brother
attended the inquest yesterday, but
did not testify. Whrgs will probably
be burled today at Wekiwa.
