By Dr. Vernon:
"Bishop Tyree, associate Bishops,
members of the Conference and
Friends ot the Church Methods: At
the' time of Richard Allen men had
a desire for freedom, which was' an
old story. There was a revolution and
a protest against political discrimina
tion. Patrick Henry, in the Virginia
House of Burgesses, had declared for
HON. WILLIAM

grandfather clause law of that state
before the United States supreme
court and -who will deliver an ad

Independence. The liberty bell had
totlled. Paul Revere had made hi?
famous ride. Crispus Attucks -had
died at Bunker Hill. Negro soldiers
had fought in the Revolutionary war.
The big, all-compelling cry was "un
hand" me; take, the shackles off. I
want 6' be free. This spirit swept
the air. Christ had come. "The truth
shall make you free, and jou shall be
free, indeed." The Church of Allen
waa indeed of God, In order that the
Gospel ot Christ might be preached
in its fullness by men who had reser
vations and harbored no prejudices.
, "The crisis was here, and as if God
had His man prepared to do His work.
The X..M. E, church was an effect;
it was an" eventuality. The conse
quences of the hypocritical preaching
and exclusive Christianity were being
shown. The Negro members were, in
the organization, but not of it.
"One element enters Into the pro
test, or the desire to escape the deg
redatlon and humiliation imposed up
on them. It was-'the whosoever will"
of Isaiah's trumpet tonguo ringing
through their hearts, impelling them
to make outward profession to inward
purity and unwilling to havo their
religion censured. The Christian du
ty fixed by others' and their conse
cration and vow renewing at the table
of the Christ of God hindered, ham
pered or impeded by those 'whose
claim was not ot better hearts and
purer life, but one of caste and color,
at whose hideous altar cowards bow
and cravens bend the knee till now.

splendid principal of the colored pub-1

In the school, In church, and in Mas

and a figure tor 30 years and his
splendid life and character has been '
the ideal that has guided many a .
youth in this commonwealth into posi
tions of honor, responsibility and !
trust. And while he has been an ideal
citizen and in things material is one 1
of the most substantial representa-1
tives of the race much of his success
both financially and as a leader of his I
people can be attributed to his keen, 1
brilliant and intellectual wife who in
hedself is a tower of strength and
whose eloquence, ability and sweet I
character have added much to his I
prestige in this grand old state.
The following letter sent by him to
the board of education ot Marshall ,
was received with positive regret and
only on account bt the serious nature
of his illness and the precarious con
dition of his health was it accepted. ,
And then only with the proviso' that if !
he recovered sufficiently to again

should not apply anywhere else than
at Marshall for his old position. The
letter is as follows:

Negroes Ignored
True to the usual selfish cus
tom of the "Pie hunters" In this
section of the country, the
colored people were studiously
Ignored in the selection of the
committee to receive and enter
tain Theodore Roosevelt on the
occasion of his coming to this
city on Memorial day. Commit
tees were appointed represent
ing the G. A. R. Post, and yet
this "patriotic" committee forgot
185,000 Negroes wore the blue
and fought for the preservation
of the Union. Committees were
appointed representing Sons of
Veterans and they forgot that
the Negro Veteran also had sons
who were ignored in their selec
tion. They appointed committees
representing the Loyal Legion
and yet tthere is no legion that's
been more loyal to the American
government and its flag than
have the black men. They ap
pointed committees representing
Spanish war veterans but they
forgot that the first blood shed
In the Spanish-American war
was shed by a Negro, Corporal
White; and that It was a Negro
regiment that irresistibly swept
up the heights of San Juan Hill
and virtually saved from annihi
lation the distinguished guest
who comes to us that day. They
appoint committees representing
the Commercial club, board of
trade and other organizations
and forget that there is a Busi
ness league of Negroes and oth
er professional organizations
amon gthe people of color in this
city. They appoint a committee
representing Sons of the Ameri
can Revolution and forget that
in Boston there is a monument
which says that the first blood
shed In the American Revolu-
tion was shed by a Negro, Cris
pus Attucks. And lastly they ap
point a delegation of "members
at large" and forget there
is a G. N. Grisham, a J. E.
Perry, a William H. Thomas, a
S. W. Bacote, a J. W. Hurse, a
W. C. Hueston, a C. H. Calloway,
a J. Silas Harris, a Nelson C.
Crews, a L. A. Knox, a Robert
DeFrantz, a F. J. Weaver and a
hundred other high class re
spectable, educated successful
professional and business men
of color in this city.
Is it because the white Union
soldier is ashamed of the cause
for which he fought? It it be
cause they are animated by the
usual selfishness of the Pie
hunter and want to court favor
with Roosevelt for themselves?
Is it because of the prejudice of
the Muehlebach hotel manage
ment? Or Is it PURE, DOWN.
RIGHT, WANTON CUSSED
NESS THAT CAUSED THIS
RANK DISCRIMINATION?
Billy Sunday ought to be kept
in Kansas City a year to teach
these moss-backs the gospel of
civic decency and fair play. BUT

HUNT LASTS FOR 24 HOURS
Officers Believe Black Intended
to
to Put Others to Death at
Leavenworth.
Leavenworth, Kas., May 13. In a
battle between twelve troopars of the
colored army service school and Pri
vate William White, negro, slayer ot
two at Fort Leavenworth, the mur
derer was captured at the post this
morning.
Thirty shots were exchanged and
not until White had been wounded
1 in the shoulder did the murdered cur
- render. His wound was not serious.
1 The hunt for White lasted more
1 than 24 hours. When the detachment
of men In charge of Corporal John
Dunton, discovered White he was hid
i ing in the sewer hole, southwest of the
, vacant infantry barracks. When he
' was discovered he opened fire on his
, former comrades.
Approached From Rear.
! A battle lasting several minutes fol
' lowed and when he was approached
! from the rear and shot he surren
dered. Although it was said yesterday he
1 had been seen in Missouri, the theory
that he crossed the river in a boat
is not taken seriously now. It is be
' lieved he secreted himself about the
: garrison and intended killing several
I more. Officers believe that.
It was reported this morning that
eight more were on the negro's list.
Feared Other Murders.
Last night former comrades and
i negro employes of the officers re
I mained Inside. The belief he was
I hiding with the intention of commit-
ting other murders spread rapidly and
after dark few negroes were seen out
side.
White yesterday killed a negro
woman servant in one of the white
officer's homes, and a negro soldier,
besides wounding a white woman.
White will be tried by court martial
at Fort Leavenworth. The penalty
for first degree murder is death by
hanging. He is the third" person fac
ing such a fate on the government res
ervation here.
Negro Kills Two
The Usual "Crap Game" Causes the
Death of George "Bud" Fletcher
and John Logan.
Two Negroes were shot to death in
the street Sunday morning by a third
Negro, Arthur Smith, who claimed he
had been cheated of twenty-five cents
in a "crap" game at 317 West Sixth
street. Smith was arrested with his
revolver in his hand by J. M. Fells, a
patrolman, who was nearby and heard
the shooting.
As Fells led Smith to the police sta
tion a crowd of Negro men and wom
en surged about him, crying "Lynch
him." Reinforcements, however, with
held the crowd.
According to Smith's statement,
George Fletcher, 207 West Seventh
street, left the room with a quarter
that belonged to Smith. Smith fired
three shots into Fletcher's back as the
latter started down the street. When
John Logan, 510 Central street, ran
toward Smith he, too, was shot. Both
died instantly.
Richard Brewer, 1718 Tracy avenue,
another Negro bystander, seized
Smith and held him until the police
arrived.
Such is the usual termination of
these unlawful games and they should
be a warning to the young Negro who
wants to be decent and who values his
life to stay away from places of this
kind.
