RuAn (I. Pleasant took the oath of
oae asGovernor of Lutlusan at 12: 1
o'elock Monday, nla the State House
grouands, Baton Rouge, where a long
liae of former governors had attested
their fealty to the constitution of the
State. The oath was administered by
Chief Justlce raLnk A. Monroe, in the
presence of more than 5,000 people.
After the ceremony, Gov. Pleasant read
hs Inaugural address.
Equalisation of assessments and tax
atlon without change of system, elimi
nation of useless oaces, abolition of
the fee system and the encouragement
of immigration and manufacturing en
terprises were chief points in the ad.
dress. The new governor retrained
from discussing legislation except in
the matter of assesments and did not
intimate what his legislativ.e program
would be The message made no
reference to liquor legislation.
The capital was thrpnged with people
from all over tle State, and three
thousand persons attended the inaugu
ral ball, Monday night.
MINUTES OF SP$CIAL MEETING.
The School Board of West Feliciana
Parish met in a special called meeting
on Saturday, May 13, 1916. All mem
berm were present.
The Hoard was called to order by
President Bowman who also stated
that the primary object of the meeting
was to consider the proposition of rr
ideing the school term for this session
by two weeks.
The question was opened for general
discussion. The tw, main reasons ad
vanced for the artiil were (1) the
notice from State Superintendent Har
ris that no further aid for the high
school and the domestic science de
partmnent would be received this year,
and It) the fact that schools were
opened so late last tflt that the last
two weeks will be in June when the
weather is so warm that both teachers
and pupils will be unable to do their
best work.
The effect of such action on the
Julius rreyhan High School was dis
ussed. It was learned that there Is
some probability of the additional aid
for the hllgh school being received. In
that case, as the aid amounts to prac
tically the cost of running the high
school for two weeks and as the aid
would not be received, If available,
unless the high school is run the full
nine months, Mr. Argue made a me.
lion that all schools be closed two
weeks earlier than the regular date
ror closing and that the superintendent
be authorised to continue the high
school for the full nine months in case
Ihe additional aid for the high school
and domestle science departments Is
received. Motion seconded by Mr. John
son ('arred.
Judge (olan appeared before, the
toard and made a plea for the boys
who had recently been suspended and
uakedl that they be reinstated. In
wder thlpt the Board might sat nlateit
ently on this request, reports were
.alled for from Principal Bliss and
Iuperlntendent ('rump as to the causes
Df the suspension of the boys. After I
.earinl these reports, motion was I
made by Mr. ArguP, seconded by
Dr. Barrow, that the action of the
principal and faculty in dismling al
boys be sustraied, sad that the matter
af their retinstatement be left to the
Prineipal and Supertntendent. Motion
carried.
Supt. ('rump then asked for a short
xecutilve sesioe ef the Board. In this a
session several matters were discutased
hut no otflcal action was taken.
