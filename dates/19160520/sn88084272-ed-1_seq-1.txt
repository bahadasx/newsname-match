Washington. D. C, Ma 20. The ad
ministration shipping bill, designed to
upbuild the merchant marine and
strengthen the nay.r, passed the house
today by a Tote of Sll to 1(1, virtually
in the form it was introduced.
The bill now goes to the senate. Two
Democrats, Olney, of Massachusetts,
and Slayden, of Texas, voted agaiuKt
the bill, and Kent, the California in
dependent, for it.
The bill proposes to appropriate
r.i,.,000,000. to be raised by I'anama
bonds, for the purchase, charter or
lease, of ships by the government, j
These ships would be sold or leased to '
j private capital as rapidly as possibli .
wun tne government reserving the
right to call them back into service as I
naval auxiliaries. The operation of
such vessels as the government was j
unable to lease or sell would not ex i
tend beyond five years after the close i
of the European war. i
A shipping board of five members I
empowered to prevent rate dlscrimina- '
"on and unfair practices by all ships
plying American waters, and to fix
maximum rates, would be created.
Republicans who delayed the vote
Friday by offering more than 100
amendments, made no further attempt

her baby was secured by Mrs. Dollle
Ledgerwood Matters who, it Is now
claimed, foisted the baby upon the

Jessie went to work in a Canadian
factory when she was 12 years old.
For three years she "kept company"
with a young shoemaker. They were
to be married. Then came the great
war and the shoemaker donned his

comrades. Some months later the girl
went to the Misericordia hospital at
It was at this hospital that Mrs.
Matters, according to testimony, came
seeking an infant that she might pass
off on the probate court as the post
humous child of her late husband of
whose 1300.000 estate she desired a
large share. Mrs. Matters is now on
trial charged with conspiracy.
The infant, a gin, was norn jui-
