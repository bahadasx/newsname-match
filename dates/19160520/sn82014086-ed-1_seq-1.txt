George F. Thompson, chairihan of the
committee, and municipal officers. Po
lice Commissioner Arthur Woods was
permitted to take the stand to at
tempt - to ' justify the . wire tapping
practice.
Mayor Mite he! and Senator Thompson
" at Odds.
Earlier in the day when the contro
versy between Mayor Mitchel and
Senator Thompson had reached an
acute stage, the mayor- accused the
senator of "cumulative treachery" to
the United States because the com
mittee chairman insisted on going
on with his inquiry after Mr. Mitchel
had protested that to do so might in
volve the federal government in grave
international complications associated
by him with the munitions contracts.
Thompson insisted the United -States
was in no way involved. He was sur
ported in this contention by District
Attorney Swann. The mystery- was
deepened tonight when United States
H. Snowden Marshall issued a
statement declaring "any publication
of the facts in the case at this, time
would be most regrettable from the
standpoint of the administration of
federal justice." "I have made inquiry
into the circumstances concerning the
investigation now going on into the
listening on the wire of Seymour &
Seymour," Mr. Marshall said, "and find
the case the police department refer
red to as having to do with the fed
eral authorities is a case I know
about, which has been of interest for
some time to tne. federal authorities
and involves national issues." x
' No International Plot.
Mr. Woods, in his testimony, failed
to make any disclosures regarding an
international plot.
The greater part -of the day was
spent by 'the committee in secret ses
sion. Late in the afternoon after the
Occupants of the offices of Seymour &
Seymour had been examined by Dis
trict Attorney Swann, it was an
nounced that the committee was sat
isfied no " crime had been committed
by the Seymours, or the other men
who shared their offices. A few min
utes later a public inquiry into the
motives that impelled the- police to
tap the wire leading to the Seymour
& Seymour offices was begun.
Commissioner Woods- was called to
the stand in the open inquiry, after
witnesses had testified that William
J. Burns, of the Burns Detective
Agency, and his son, Sherman-, had
engaged a room adjoining the Sey
mour oufflces and caused the installa
tion of telephonic devices. It already
had been announced by the district
attorney that thS Burns detectives
were engaged by the firm - of J. P.
Morgan & Co., from whose offices had
been pilfered official messages from
the French government relative to
the munitions supplies. It was al
leged -this information was sold to
munitions manufacturers - to enable
them to make satisfactory bids. .
Burns Men Worked With Police.;
The police commissioner did not dis
cuss the Seymour case. He admitted,
however," that the - Burns detectives
had worked in- co-operation with the
police in the case and that he had
given the necessary permission to
"listen In" on the telephone.
v Wire Tapping a Police Necessity.
Mr. Woods devoted most, of his time
to detailing the methods used by the
police in tapping wires and the neces
sity for the practice. Cognizant of
the fact that the committee has the
power to propose legislation against
the -practice the commissioner said:

representative of the progressive na
tional committee.
Secretary O. K. Davis, in a state
ment, said:
"It has been boldly asserted by cer
tain republican leaders that they in
tend to 'let Mr. Roosevelt write their
party platform.' I take it that what
these gentlemen mean is that they
are going to have the platform writ
ten out of the recent declarations - by
the colonel concerning Americanism
and preparedness and commit their
party to this program, while at the
same time they seek to have their
convention . select as their nominee
some other man than the one whose
aggressiveness and force have made
these things the paramount issue of
the day."
, The progressive national committee
will meet in Chicago June 5th, to
complete arrangements for the sarty
convention.

Twenty-five Mexican cowboys from
the Hearst ranch at Babicora scat

Americans and Carranza followers. Af
ter the theft of a number of horses
from the Hearst ranch, Aie bandits
began guerilla warfare.
Employes of the ranch surprised the
bandits in camp. The six taken pris
oners were delivered to Carranza au
thorities in Madera.
Among the dead were Dominguez and

REPUBLICANS FILIBUSTERING .
ON THE SHIPPING BILL
Tryicj to Prevent Its Passage Before
' . Adjournment.
Wpshinson. May -19. Filibustering
Republican I.pacfer J.Iahn tonight pre
vented the demoeratis from carrying
dut their plan to pass' the administra
tion shipping bill before,. adjournment.
Debate on the measure closed at' 4
o'clock this afternoon and three-hours
later it was ready for passage vir-'
fua'lv as reported by the committee.
in spite of persistent effort to amend it.
Representative Ma.nn .demanded teller
votes on many of the hundred or more
amendments offered by republicans and
while a final vote on the measure it
self wa s about to be taken he insist
ed that the formality of reading the
engrossed bill be observed. As the bill
had not been engrossed, there was
nothing to do but adjourn. The vote
probably will be reached early- tomor
row afternoon.
Early in the day while the house was
in the committee of the whole, the re
publicans succeeded in striking out the
section providing for the purchase of
ships by the government, but this was
restored bv the house itself. The only
result of the strict party vote by
which the section was strisken out, 106
to 90. was to give the republicans an
opportunity to cheer and laugh at the
discomfiture of the democrats over
the failure of their forces to - be on
hand to vote. Majority leaders Im
mediately sent out hurried calls for
members and. when the section again
was voted on it was restored by a
vote of 205 to 152. Indications to
night were that the bill would pass
without vital amendment by almost a
strict party vote.

Border Patrol is Cein? De
ston's realignment of the border patrol
is being delayed, war department ofil-i
cials eaid tonight, because of eiowl
mobilization of the Arizona and Npwj
Mexico National guard and iiy it-ej
disappointing showing in numbers and)
equipment of some of the guard wm-j
panies that have reported for service.
Arizona Troops Slow.
Although it has been ten days F'na'
President Wilson called out the Texas j
Arizona and New Mexico guardsmen
for patrol duty along the border, the!irj
mobilization and assignment is far!
from complete. The Texas companiisi
responded promptly, but in the o;h-r
two states the call has not met wuhj
as quick a response as 'officials ex-i
pected. - . 4
Companies Below Paper Strength.
In addition, so many companies Inj
all three states have been found to bq
below their paper streng li that the
war department now expects the total
guardsmen provided will not be moraj
than 3,000,. and probablv a few hun
dred less. When the call was Issue
it was depended on to add 3,500 m?it
to the border patrol.
So far General Funston has repertcct
only in a general way on the national
gu.Td mobilization, but a fuller rr-port
is expected early next week. Offi.-ials
hope that by that time the reassis-
ment of troops along, the toordsr will
I have been completed. .
