GOOD ROADS BILL MOVES.
Little Doubt President Will Sign
Measure if Senate and House
Agree.
Washington, May 16.?Representa?
tive James F. Byrnes ,of Alken, who
ia an enthusiastic member of the
house committee on roads ,1s con?
vinced that there will be a federal
good roads act at this session of
congress. He said today that the
roads committee would meet at once,
In view of Republican Leader Mann's
refusal to give unanimous consent for
sending the house bill to conference
with the senate bill, and would ask
for a special rule to get a vote on
this matter. There is no doubt that
the house would vote for a conference.
The house bill provides for an ex?
penditure of $25,000,000 the first
year, to be distributed among the
States in proportion to their area,
population, and rural mail route
mileage, provided the States them?
selves contribute an amount equal to
the federal government's contribution.
The senate bill appropriates $5,000,
000 the first year and increases that
amount $5,000,000 every year for five
years, reaching $25,000,000 the fifth
year. There is good reason to be?
lieve that the president will sign a
good roads bill if the senate and house
agree on one, and that may be one
reason why the minority leader in
the house is filibustering against a
conference.
GERMAN CONSUL ARRESTED.

SUCCESS CROWNS EFFORTS.
SMITH PLEASED WITH NITRATE
SECTION.
South Carolina Senator Feels That
Triumph Wen Repays His Efforts,
Despite Much Work.
Washington, May 17.?When the
senate today adopted the report of the
conference committee on the military
preparedness bill, there immediately
followed a spirited debate continuing
until the final vote around the section
which contained in substantially its
original form the measure of Senator
Smith of South Carolina providing
for the establishment by the govern?
ment of nitrate plants for the produc?
tion of nitric acids for explosives in
time of war and nitrogen for fertilizer
in time of peace. A hard fight, par?
ticipated in by Senators Hardwick,
Smoot and others against this meas?
ure, has attended its every parliamen?
tary stage and it has been only by
the most adroit management that Sen?
ator Smith has been able to pilot this
proposition to its finally successful
conclusion. Senator Smith took occa?
sion today to state that this section
as embodied in the preparedness
measure is substantially in the same
form in which he originally intro?
duced it, he having agreed to some
minor suggestions made to him by the
conferees in their deliberations
Among others who spoke in support
of this provision of the report was
Senator Stone, chairman of the com?
mittee on foreign relations, who said
"I wapt this provision to go through
and I do not know but that I would
be willing to give almost any number
of men to get that government plant
established, for I feel that whatever
may happen, the government of the
United States ought to be in a position
of absolute independence when it
comes to supplying the means neces?
sary for its defense for its protec?
tion, or for its lawful purposes, wheth?
er they be for defense or something
else."
The acceptance of the conference
report today closes the matter in the
senate, and Senator Smith this even
stated that he regarded this as
Hg|het;?the most important pieces, of
. legislation with which he has been as
1 eociated during his service in the sen?
ate.
"It has been a long, hard fight at
every stage of the game," said the
junior Palmetto State senator, "and
it represents an enormous amount of
work upon my part, but the splendid?
ly successful issue of the matter war?
rants everything that has been done.
I regard this measure in all of its
ramifications as the most vital fea?
ture to the programme of prepared?
ness as well as a factor of untold
importance to the agricultural welfare
of the nation."
DOUGLAS IN WRECK.
South Carolina, Carranzlsta Repre?
sentative, Escapes Trouble When
Zapatistas Loot Train.
Washington, May 17.?The follow?
ing story concerning the wrecking
and robbing of a train a few days ago

ter was robbed of $36,000 paper

las' private car, which was the only
one not molested by the bandits, and
escaped the notice of the Zapatistas.
He said Douglas, who had been act?
ing as attorney for Carranza, had $20,
000 of new Carranzlsta paper money
in the car.
"Other advices reaching the border
were that valuables worth approxi?
mately $500,000 were overlooked.
These were In the express car. All

BAPTISTS PUN CHURCH AID
ENDOWMENT BIG QUESTION
FOR CONVENTION.
Southern Convention Will Begin Ses?
sions in Ashevillc Today to Continue
for Five Days.
Asheville, N. C, May 16.?Plans for
completion of the $1,000,000 fund to
aid the 4,000 homeless Baptist
churches in the South will be one of
the principal subjects at the 61st an?
nual convention of the Southern Bap?
tist church which opens here tomor-'
row and continues through May 32.
Approxim *ely one-third of this sum
already ' en raised, according to
prelimi' eports made public to?
night , Rev. Dr. Louis B. War?
ren r * nta, superintendent of the
depr & t of church extension.,
J tf r subject which probably
w considered will be,the pro
? ^ .ormation of an educational
^ as a separate organization from
i boards. Opposition to the ea>
>? .ishment of such a board has been
itsed on the ground that such work
i adequately cared for by the home
mission board. The board would ex?
ercise general supervision over the
Baptist church educational work in
the South.
Tomorrow's sessions will be devoted
chiefly to elections of officers and pre?
sentation of reports. Adoption of a
programme for the convention also
will be taken up.
Reports to be made public at the
opening sessions include those of the
foreign mission board, the home mis?
sion board, the Sunday school board,
the laymen's movement and the wo
I man's missionary union.
The registration and housing of
delegates took up the greater part of
today. The registration secretaries
estimated tonight that 1,500 delegates
would attend the opening session, and
that approximately 2,000 would regie*
ter during the convention. The dele?
gates represent more than 2,000,000
persons of the Baptist faith, virtually
all residing south of the Mason and
Dixon line except for certain churches
in Illinois wr'ch left the Northern

Many (Horses Expected to Winter
There.
Charleston, May 17.?Indlca.tlona
point to the presence in Charleston
at the track of the Charleston Fair
and Racing association of between
300 and 400 of the best race horses
in the country for winter training. A
number of strings, among them the
Sanford, McComber and Carmen sta?
bles, have signified their intention Of
spending the winter training season
si the local track. A conservative
estimate of the amount of money
that this would bring to the City is
between $100,000 and $150,000. In
addition the people of the city would
have the pleasure of viewing some of
the finest horse flesh in America.
If all this comes about as is ex?
pected, it is due to the winning of the
first two places in the Kentucky
Derby at Louisville by George Smith
and Starhawk, two horses who had
their winter training in Charleston at
the local track. This event, which is
the premier among racing events in
the country, was run off last Satur?
day. Twelve of the finest horses in
America, it is stated, were the par?
ticipants. George Smith belongs to
the Sanford stables and Starhawk,
who ran his first race in America in
the Derby, belongs to the McComber
stables.
