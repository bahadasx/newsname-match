SHARP BUTTLE
Mexican Horsemen Defeat
Band Organized to Make,
Trouble on Border
NEUTRAL GROUP IS
REPORTED FORMING
Officials Worried About Big
Force Rallying Around
Unattached Leader
Field headquarters, near Namiquipa,
May 19.—Via wireless to Columbus,
N. M.—Twenty-five Mexican cowboys
from the Hearst ranch at Babicora
broke and scattered a newly formed
gang of bandits near Madera about a
week *ago, killing fifteen, wounding
one and capturing six, according to
news reaching here today.
The band had been organized by
Atezutro Dominguez and Pedro Cas
tillo, who announced their enmity for
Americans and Carranzlstas. Follow
ing the theft of a number of horses
from the Hearst ranch for mounts,
they began a sort of guerilla warfare.
Employes of the ranch surprised the
bandits in camp near the ranch viejo.
The six taken prisoner were deliv
ered to Carranzlsta authorities at
Madera.
Among the dead were Dominguez
and Castillo, the toll bringing the
number of Villistas slain up to nearly
250 since the American punitive ex
pedition was sent across the, border
about nine weeks ago.
The cowboys captured thirty horses,
a number of rifles and other booty.
NEW BAND GATHERS.
Marathon, Tex., May 19.—Rosalia
Hernandez, with 300 armed followers,
is camping at Rancho de Enclnillas,
near Laguna de Jaco, 165 miles south
of the border and forty miles south of
where the American expeditionary
force camped yesterday. According
to reports, Hernandez has a total of
500 men under his command in the
Immediate vicinity of his headquar
ters.
Hernandez is alleged to be a mili
tary and political free lancer and does
not subject himself or his followers
to the dictums of either Carranza or
Villa.
It was said here today that Col. Sib
ley's expeditionary column is expected
to reach Boqulllas late Saturday after
noon unless he is advised by his su
periors to remain on Mexican soil or
is reinforced with more cavalry. Maj.
Langhorne, with the eighth cavalry,
Is trailing slowly behind Col. Sibley
and may not reach the border until
late Sunday or early Monday morn
ing.
PRISONERS RELEASED.
Columbus, N. M., May 19.—Ninety
Villista prisoners, captured by Ameri
can cavalrymen in the engagement at
Ojo Azules, Chihuahua, late in April,
have been released, according to civil
ians returning to the border today.
The prisoners were held some days
and questioned in an attempt to obtain
Information concerning the movements
of the various scattered bands and
then released, it was said. At mili
tary headquarters the reports concern
ing the release were received with
som surprise, although a number of
prisoners have been captured during
the campaign and Bix of them have
been Imprisoned in the stockade built
here.
A number of American soldiers en
camped between Colonia Dublan and
Namiquipa recently became ill after
eating food purchased from Mexicans
and as a result several of the natives
were taken into custody, the arrivals
said. Military authorities have taken
steps to prevent a repetition of the
danger.
Heavy traffic over the motor truck
trail from Columbus to Namiquipa has
made it almost impassable, truckmen
said. In some places the road, despite
efforts of the engineering corps, has
become so rutted as to make impossi
ble a greater speed than three miles
an hour.
Some of the truckmen reported to
the hospital upon their arrival suffer
ing from illnesses presumably caused
by the heavy jolting.
TO HANG BANDITS.
Brownsville, Tex., May 19.—The
first legal execution in punishment for
the slaying of Americans in border
raids by Mexican bandits last summer
and .fall were set for today with the
hanging here of Melquaides Chapa and
Jose Buenrostro, found guilty of mur
der In connection with the death of A.
L. Austin and his son, Charles, in a
raid on Sebastian, Cameron county,
August 6, 1916. No exact hour has
been«set for the executions.
FLETCHER AS3IGNED.
Washington, D. C., May 19—Admiral
Fletcher will be assigned to the naval
general board to succeed Rear Admiral
Badger, retired, when tonight he sur

CAVALRY VALUE
NOT DECREASED
BY AEROPLANES
ARMY OFFICERS LOUD IN THEIR
PRAISE OF THE TRAINED
U. 8. HORSEMEN.
Field Headquarters, May 11.—By
motor truck to Columbus, N. M., May
19.—One phase of the Villa chase not
ed by army officers has been that the
value of cavalry for scouting and all
around fighting has not at all de
CFGftBG(l*
Notwithstanding the use of aero
planes for scouting, the cavalry recon
nolssance lost none of Its military
value. Four sets of conditions de
veloped, under which the aeroplanes
could not scout—In fog, darkness, in
rain and in cloudy weather. The cav
alry did its most efficient scouting in
darkness, or under cover of rain
clouds. Every Important fight with
bandits was accomplished under cover
of night, which made surprise attacks
possible.
Few persons, even those with the
expedition, realized that the remark
able work of the auto trucks in main
taining the supply line was done
largely as an auxiliary for cavalry op
erations. The daily ration for one
soldier averages two pounds, whereas,
the daily ration for a horse is eleven
pounds, so that the trucks were carry
ing a heavy proportion of their loads
for the cavalry horses.
For several weeks most of the cav
alry campaigned without truck rations
either for man or horse, but this work
brought out another distinctive value
of thoroughly trained cavalry. This
was the cavalryman's individual skill
as a horseman, which enabled the men
to keep their mounts alive and service
able, not only on scanty fodder but on
no feed at all.
In all their battles, the cavalrymen
fought as infantry, that is dismounted,
and with rifles or pistols.: The differ
ence between them and mounted In
fantry lay in the years of careful train
ing which enabled them to keep the
horses going under conditions so try
ing that probably nine-tenths of th9
animals would have perished under
,the handling oj^nyone. except an ex
pert horseman.

TARIFF PLANNED.
Chicago, May 19.—Preparation of
the republican platform which will be
submitted to the national convention
of the party for adoption next month,
has been begun, according to word
brought here by Fred W. Upham,
chairman of the local committee on
arrangements for the convention, who
returned from New York today after a
conference with Chairman C. D. Hilles,
and other members of the republican
national committee.
Strong planks favoring Americanism
military preparedness and a protective
tariff for the protection of American
industries, it is said, will be among the
important subjects considered by those
who are drafting the party platform.
The plank on Amerlcansm and mili
tary preparedness will, it is declared,
be sufficiently strong to meet every
reasonable demand of progressive re
publicans, according to reports receiv
ed here. It is said that prominent pro
gressives who have recently returned
to the republican party .will be con
sulted before the finishing touches are
put on these sections of the* platform.

a bartender, died last night from
strangulation by hanging himself with
a clothesline attached'to a nail in the
wall. In order to accomplish his pur

body. Despondency over closing of
local salooons and lack of work
prompted Maasen to seek death by his

Colonel Gives Preparedness
Speech at Detroit and
Hits Administration
SAYS COMPROMISE
IS IMPROPER MOVE
Makes Earnest Plea for a
More Emphatic Display
of Americanism
Detroit, Mich., May 19.—Hundreds
of school children waving American
flags were among the throng which
greeted Theodore Roosevelt at the
railway station this forenoon, when he
arrived here to be the guest of honor
at the American day celebration.
Before Col. Roosevelt was driven to
the Detroit Athletic club, at the'head
of an automobile parade, he made a
short address to the boy scouts who
were lined up in front of the station.
He told them he believed in their or
ganization because it taught them to
light for the truth and "not to be mol
lycoddles."
After luncheon at the D. A. C., Col.
Roosevelt spent nearly two hours In
privacy before he went to a local
opera house to deliver an address on
"Americanism and Preparedness For
Peace."
This afternoon Col. Roosevelt was to
make a short address to a mass meet
ing in Grand Circus park in the heart
of the business district. Before he re
turns to New York late this afternoon
he is to make an automobile tour of
the city. It was announced that he
expects to spend a few moments visit
ing Henry Ford at the latter's automo
bile factory.
Refuses to Prepare.
Col. Roosevelt prefaced his speesb
of the day by announcing that he had
"come herf to Mfchigan Hecaufie in th?
primary for thfc selection of delegates
to the republican national convention,
Mr. Ford was victorious, and following
on his victory here, he showed a mark
ed popular strength in Nebraska and
Pennsylvania. The effect of this show
ing has been immediately visible upon
many of the politicians within and
without congress."
"We, through our representatives at
Washington," said Col. Roosevelt,
"have absolutely refused In the small
est degree to prepare during these
twenty-two months of world cataclysm.
We have refused to learn the smallest
part of the lesson being written on
the scro.ll of torment in Europe. We
have fatuously refused to take the
smallest step, either to do our duty
to ourselves or to do our duty to oth
ers. We have endeavored to deceive
ourselves by announcing that in this
policy of supine inaction and of failure
to perform duty, we are actuated by
the loftiest motives. I doubt whether
we have really deceived ourselves, and
most certainly we have not deceived
others. There is not a nation In the
world which believes that our course
of conduct has been dictated by any
thing save timidity, unworthy shrink
ing from effort and responsibility, and
cold and selfish love of money making
and of soft ease.
Hits at Wilson.
In any serious crista there are al
ways men who try to carry water on
toth shoulders. These men try to es
cape the hard necessity of choice be
tween two necessarily opposite alter
natives, by trying to work up some
compromise. In actual practice, this
compromise usually proves to com
bine with exquisite nicety all the de
fects and none of the advantages of
both courses. It is true that in ordi
nary political matters compromise is
essential. It is true that in ordinary
times it Is essential. But there come
great crises when compromise Is
either Impossible or fatal. This Is
one of those crises. There is no use
in saying that we will fit ourselves
to defend ourselves a little, but not
much. Such a position is equivalent
to ann.ouncing that, if necessary, we
shall lilt, but that we shall only hit
soft. The only right principle Is to
prepare thoroughly or not at all. The
only right principle is to avoid hitting
if it is possible to do so, but never
under any circumstances to hit soft.
To go to war a little, but hot much, is
the one absolutely certain way to en
sure disaster. To prepare a little but
not much stands on a par with a city
developing afire department which,
after afire occurs, can put it out a
little, but not much."
Colonel Roosevelt declared that the
Wilson administration "has taken no
step for preparedness and has done
nothing efficient to sustain our nation
al rights." Because, he said, the ad
ministration had at intervals "ven.
tured feebly to speak in contradiction
of its non-action," the ultra-pacifists
and their followers have refused it any
whole hearted support. They object,
Colonel Roosevelt added, "even to
make believe preparedness they In
sist on even more thorough going help
lessness than that which we had so
amply provided at Washington."

NEW ADVANTAGES
OVER THE FRENCH
PARIS REPORT INSIST8 THAT
MOST OF NEW ATTACK#
WERE BEATEN BACK.
Part*, May 19.—One hundred
and fifty steamer* have been as
eembled at the Hungarian aeaport
of Flume to transport troops, mu
nitions and supplies under pro
tection of the Austro-Hungarlan
fleet to Duraxzo, Albania. This
Information was .received here In
advices from Innsbruck. It Is
supposed here that the Auetrlans
intend to make a strong attack
on the Albanian town of Avlona,
which Is occupied by the Italians.
Paris, May 19.—Violent (fighting on
a large scale was resumed on the Ver
dun front last night. Two fresh divi
sions of German troops attacked
French positions at Avocourt wood,
and hill 304, west of the Meuse. The
war office announces that the attacks
In the main were unsuccessful, al
though the Germans obtained a foot
ing In the small post south of hill 287
which lies just to the east of Avocourt
wood.
The Germans attempted to recap
ture the small fort on the northeast
slope of hill 304 which the French
took on the preceding day but their
effort failed.
Infantry fighting was confined for
the most pari to the sector west of
the Meuse. East of the river and in
the Woevre the artillery was active.
The official statement says that the
troops employed by the Germans in
their attacks had recently been sent
to the Verdun front.
Sublieutenant Navarre, one of the
best known French aviators, who re
cently engaged in a fight with five
German aeroplanes, brought down his
tenth machine in an aerial combat at
Dolante in the Argbnne.
TRENCHES CAPTURED.
Berlin, May 19:—French trenches on
both sides of the Hpucourt-Eanes high
road 8if fhtf Verdun front west of the
Meuse have been captured by the Ger
mans, the war office announced today.
Nine French officers and 120 men
were taken prisoner.
WAR 8UMMARY.
Although the Austrian offensive on
the Italian front Is meeting with stif
fer resistance, ground Is still being
wrested from Gen. Gadorna's forces,
which, according to unofficial reports,
have at points been pushed back as
much as five miles.
The main line of attack is In the
southern Tyrol, where the recent near
approach of the Italians to Rovereto
had threatened that place, a key posi
tion in the defense of Trent. The latest
report from Vienna shows continued
progress for the Austrlans in the val­!not
leys southeast of Rovereto, their forces
crossing the frontier by capturing the
Maggio ridge and working into it
alien territory as far as Costabella,
which was captured.
Counter attacks by the Italians have
not resulted in any territory being won
back from the Austrlans, according to
I the Vienna war office, which also
claims the capture of more than 900
additional prisoners, together with
eighteen cannon and machine guns.
The Austrian losses are declared to
have been small.

SUFFRAGETTE IS
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt
Talks to Immense Crowd
Urging Votes for Sex
ASKS MEN TO GIVE
WOMEN A CHANCE
Tells of Conditions Found
in Europe Takes Fling
at Anti's Methods
"On June 5, we ask yon men of Iowa,
the sovereigns of this state, to take
your crown oft your head for Just a
nloment and touch it on the head of
the wife by your side, as la
the graceful oustom of royalties
abroad, uplifting her from the position
of subject and seating her on the*
throne by your side, that you In Iowa
may go on ruling forever together,"
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt with these
words, evoked a storm of applause
from the immense audience which
packed the Grand opera house Thurs
day evening to hear this widely known
woman discuss the subject so close to
the hearts, of Iowa woman—their en
franchisement. Her sweet, womanly
presence and charming manner won
the hearts of her hearers, while her
clear, logical arguments, her state
ments backed by facts and statistics,
appealed to the reason of all. She
was presented by M. C. Gilmore who
was introduced by Mrs. J. K. Dysart,
chairman of'Wapello county's suffrage
organization.
"By all the rules, admittedly, a wom
an Is a person and therefore women
are people," said the speaker. "Abra
ham Lincoln at Gettysburg called the
United States 'a government of the
people, by the people and for the peo
ple.' If she Is a person 364 days of the
year, what is she on election day,
when she Is not counted as a person?
The nation.,cannot 'exist one-half gov
erned by the men and women, and the
other half governed by the men alone.
The difference between an antl and
a suffragist, is that the former does
not wish to vote and is determined
that other women shall not. while the
suffragist may1 or may not want to
vote, but is willing that the other wom
an may have the same choice. In
regard to the old argument that wom
en's place is the home, let me ask,
how many women do stay at home all
the time? Do not your wife and moth
er, visit for society and charity, go to
church, reading circle, the theater,
clubs, dinners, bridge parties and
teas? Why should they not take, at
the longest, an hour once a year, to
express in a way that counts their
sacred opinions? Even the antis do
stay at home. They have come
all the way from Massachusetts to tell
I the men of Iowa to keep their women
at home. I hope you men appreciate
their solicitude.
"Here in Iowa the women are Intel
ligent enough to help keep the schools
going, religious enough to help keen
the churches going, charitable enough
to help care for the needy and law
abiding enough to help maintain the
police forces. Are they not to be
trusted? Why does Iowa hesitate? No
human being can stop this next step
in democracy, for it has grown and
will continue to grow as does every
lofty ideal. We fear a new idea and
oppose it as every new belief has been
opposed by the majority since time be
gan. History shows that no large
class ever began anything." Mrs. Catt
scored a hit when she told in her dryly
humorous way of the struggle which
has always been Incident to a progres
sive move. She referred to Kent, one
of the greatest of legal lights, who, in
his books, wrote of the struggle when
the question came up of enfranchising
all men, instead of just the land own
ers. The latter declared that men in
general were too ignorant, too hyster
ical and emotional to be trusted with
universal suffrage. The descendants
,of the men so referred to by the land
ed persons, are now asked to refuse
the ballot to women for the same
reasons, declared Mrs. Catt.
Bfcrs. Catt, who is a woman of varied
attainments and liberal education, has
traveled extensively abroad in the in
terests of the cause, and her discus
sion of women in Europe and Asia was
interesting in the extreme. Universal
or partial suffrage has been granted
for many years in almost every coun
try across the water, among them be
ing Sweden, Norway, Herzegovina,
Bosnia, Russia, Denmark, Iceland, Ger
many, Finland, England, Ireland, Scot
land and Wales. She has had the priv
ilege of sitting in the municipal parlia
ments of many of these countries,
where women meet on equal terms
with the men. In China, at the close
of the revolution, ten places were vol
untarily given to women in the first
assembly. Mrs. Catt was an interest
ed spectator at the first session. Ha
w&lian men and women, meeting her
as she landed there a few years ago,
told Mrs. Catt that they were all
ready and anxious to enfranchise wo
men, hut feared to submit the proposi
tion to the United States congress lest
it ,be. vetoed.

ORPET'S LAWYERS
INDICATE LINE OF
CLIENT'S DEFENSE
CLAIM 18 MADE THAT MARION
LAMBSRT THREATENED TO
COMMIT SUICIDE.
Watikegan,
111.,
May
19.—Examina­
tion of prospective jurors will again
oocupy the day at the trial of Will
Orpet, the University of Wisconsin
student accused of the murder of
Marion Lambert. Yesterday's sessions
were retrogressive Insofar as securing
of jurymen was concerned, for when
oourt opened in the morning there
were four jurors In the box who had
been tentatively acoepted by both sides
and when the day's work ended but
three remained and two of those have
been accepted only by one side. Len
Bartell of Antloch,
111.,
foreman In an
Ice plant, Is the lone man in the jury
box accepted by both sides. The
state has used four of
ltB
peremptory
challenges and the defense live.
A letter said to have been written by
Miss Lambert to Orpet a few days be
fore her death last February may be
the point of evidence upon which the
defense of the student may hinge. This
fact was made public yesterday by
James H. Wilkerson, Orpefs chief
counsel. The letter, according to the
attorney, drew Orpet from Madison to
Lake Forest on the day before the
girl's death, for in it she had threaten
ed self destruction. The defense con
tends that It was in answer to this let
ter that Orpet wrote the note said to
be In possession of the prosecution In
which the student said: "Don't do any
thing desperate until I arrive."
Mr. Wilkerson said he was not at
liberty to Bay what reason the girl ad
vanced for self destruction. He also
refused to say whether the girl's let
ter was still In existence but stated
that Orpet will testify as to the letter
when he is called to the witness stand.
It Is felt that on this letter, if its ex
istence can be substantiated, the de
fense will have a strong chance of ac*
qulttal. With the announcement that
the letter had been written threaten
ing suicide, the defense gave the flret
Intimation of the lines that will be fol
lowed in the light to save the young
man from conviction.
STILL HOPING TO
CET BUILDING PLAN
ADMINISTRATION WANTS CON-
GRE8S TO ASSUffe
MANY
AD-
DITION8 TO NAVY.
Washington, D. C., May 19. —Admin
istration officials were confident today
that congress would provide a satisfac
tory naval building program, despite
the fact that the house naval commit
tee in its agreement yesterday aban
doned the five year program as recom
mended by President Wilson and Sec
retary Daniels.
Officials were particularly disap
pointed at the action of the committee
in providing for all battle cruisers and
they believe that some dreadnoughts
are necessary.
It was generally understood today
that congress would be pressed for a
program that would include at least
two dreadnoughts, together with four
battle cruisers.
Formal announcement by Majority
Leader Kitchin that he would not op
pose the program as provided for in
the naval appropriation bill completed
by the committee yesterday is consid
ered significant, in view of the fact
that he has been opposed to the ad
ministration's preparedness measures.
Mr. Kitchin declared that the bill wap
satisfactory to him and that he might
make a speech in favor of it.
It was regarded as likely today that
the bill would be taken up for consider
ation in the house next week, although
some of the leaders do not look for
a vote on the measure prior to the na
tional conventions.
