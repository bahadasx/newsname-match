Strong Secures Nomination with Small
Margin; Graff Sweeps District for Senate;
W.H.Wood Leads Watson by4oo Votes
In the race for the Republican
nomination for Congress in this,
the 27th congressional district,
Nathan L. Strong has a majority
of 104 over S. Taylor North with
the vote from seven precincts in
the four counties missing. "The
Clover township vote in Jef
ferson county is one of the mis
sing," says the Punxsutawney
Spirit; "and it is generally con
ceded that this will increase Mr.
Strong's majority slightly."
The congressional race be
tween Strong and North proved
surprisingly close and the mis
sing precincts may change the
results, although it is not pro
bable since it is generally con
ceded that the missing districts
will increase Strong's lead.
The vote of this county be
tween candidates for the dif
tferent offices follows:
