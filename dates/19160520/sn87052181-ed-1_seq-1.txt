STATE NEEDS NEW TAX LAW
Dean Loeb of State University Dis
cusses Constitutional Convention
Before Bar Association,
"Tho most conspicuous defect of tho
present Missouri constitution is in re
gard to taxation and revenue," de
clared Isldor Loeb, dean of tho faculty
of the University of Missouri, before
the Kansas City Bar association the
other night,
"This applies," added Dr. Loeb, "not
only to tho state as a whole, but to
counties, cities, towns and school dis
tricts. Under the constitution tho leg
islature is powerless to chango the
present tax system. Scores of changes
must bo made to equalize the tax bur
den throughout the state and to per
mit these cities, towns, counties and
school districts to do the things) they
need to do. The Missouri constitution
has more tax restrictions than any
other state constitution in the Union."
Dr. Loeb calls attention to tho pres
ent predicaments of tho state in which
It finds itself without sufficient funds
to pay running expenses and the sal
aries of the faculty of tho state univer
sity. Many reasons he assigned for
the falling off In revenue the de
crease In beer inspection receipts, of
saloon license receipts, the discontin
uing of factory contracts in the pris
ons. "Since 1875, when the present state
constitution was framed, great changes
have taken place," said Dr. Loeb.
"Population has Increased from less
than 2,000.000 to more than 3,500,000
people, the city population from 20 per
cent to 43 per cent of tho total state
population. Public utilities and tho
corporate management of business
were then in their Infancy. Agricul
ture, manufactures and education havo
been revolutionized.
It Is evident, therefore, that a con
stitutional convention Is tho only
means by which all the needed
changes can bo properly put before
the people.

And how the war has boomed their
particular business!
Prices have been sent soaring. This
'has inado. Jt possible to transport
i wasto from far-distant points that was
never UGablo before -Despised Junk
Is now rich raw material. Why",- wool
en rags aro worth almost their weight
In gold they cost throo times as much
as they did before the war. Some
rags have gono up 600 per cent. And
so we get tho Btrango anomaly that
somo rugs fetch moro than raw wool!
Why? Becauso they havo been dyed
and dealers want thoso precious dyes
back again (and they get them). With
Germany blockaded, no dyes of many
of which they havo a monopoly can
como out.
Shoddy? You turn your noso at It!
Do you realize that shoddy Is tho only
thing that has enabled tho poor to
wear woolen clothing nt all? Or that
without docoptlon (to tho tailors) It is
used to face somo of tlio finest cloths

makes a better llnlsh.
Look at tho romanco of coal tar.
Onco dumped Into vllo-smelllng heaps
of rcfuso or pumped Into tho river, to
day It yields more than two thousand
colors, besides drugs, preservatives,
medicines, explosives, flavors, syn
thetic sugar and qulnlno, perfumes,
chemicals, and what not. Thoro Is a
business of moro than $100,000,000 In
coal tar by-products today. And this Is
not a part of tho business of utilizing
wasto, either, for coal tar Is no longer
counted as waste, but ns a useful
product from baking coal and mak
ing Illuminating gas of it. Tho 140
pounds of tar from every ton is tho
most precious of nil tho yield from
coal.
Germany is doing economical won
ders with Its war waste today. Tho
"sammelstello" Is tho chief point of In
terest to tho visitor who can get be
hind the lines. "Collection point" It
would bo in plain English Junk pile,
really. It contains tho gleanings of
tho battletleld. Every conceivable ob
ject, from bits of rubber to broken
bayonets and pieces of exploded shells,
aro collected and sorted.
Experts run over everything. Car
tridges are saved out, and water bot
tles and clothcB still lit to wear aro
piled up. Tho bayonets go to ono
place to bo made over; tho rltlos aro
overhauled every kind of mako and
come back llko now. Ripped and
bursted auto tires go to tho molting
pot nnd como back as Bound whlto
oues. A big laundry cleans 100,000
garments every month. Damaged ar
tillery goes to shops, whero it Is re
paired. Wheels aro remado; barrels
rebored. A new gun Is often made
out of tho undamaged parts of sevcrul
guns collectively put out of business.
Leather Is set to other uses, shoes
are repaired and straps that aro torn
aro cut Into other widths and lengths,
and put to other tasks.
And what do wo do hero along sim
ilar lines. In theso piping peace days?
Woll, for examplo, wo work over tin
cans a perfect tnino of wealth and
iron scrap, and got back $14,000,000
worth of useful metal again. Our tin
is used over and over, ne-foro tho war
scrap iron brought $10.75 a ton; now

You haven't a pound of old antimony
lying around tho shop, perhaps? The
foxy Chlneso havo cornered It becauso
of its great demand for munitions of
war to say nothing of type. Onco It
was worth $125 a ton; now you pay
$000 gold a ton for tho samo. Why?
Because It is mixed with steel for
shells, making it moro brittle. Thus
it breaks Into smaller pieces when It
explodes. Nice thought for tho men
In tho trenches; what?
So they are working over old, worn
out type, hero and abroad, and explod
ed shell fragments, to get back this
near-precious metal.
Tungsten la used In making tool

It has been figured out by a junkman
expert that this country loses $36,000,
000 a year In cotton wastago alono,
after the last shred of tho fiber has
been saved that can be. And this la
how:
Wrapped In Jute bagging and strapped
with hoop Iron, last year's bales aver
aged 609 pounds apiece. Just 5,649,000
of theso bales went to American mills.
Actually thero was spun Into cloth and
yarn tho equivalent of 4,801,650 bales,
becauso of 15 por cent loss. This Is di
vided Into two classos, raw matorial
wasto and manufacturing waste. The
first counts tho bagging and Iron
straps, Included In .tho weight, the
shrinkage and three pounds torn ofT
In transit for samples. Tho second In
cludes flying cotton lint, cotton dam
aged In processing and, tho quantity
that remains that Is not splnnnble.
The latter Is ono of tho now savings
now. Suppose a two-Inch length Is
required; some la not that long. This
goes for a coarser yarn to another
mill, and tho rcsiduo thero goes to
still another for even coarser products,
nnd in tho step-down from mill to mill
tho final re3lduum lands In a factory
making wlcking, mop yarns, etc.
Actually, though there Is a 15 per
cent theoretical wasto In rt balo of cot
ton, tho total los3 Is reduced to a mini
mum and only 3 per cent goes to tho
junk dealer to Bort out and, sell, In all
tho processes through which a bale
goes but 2 per cent 1b Irrecoverably
lost In Hying lint. Added' to tho 3 per
cent which Is tho junkman's share,
thero is 6 per cent lost inlmanufactur
Ing and 10 per cent In riw material.
In other words, tho manuf jcturor loses
Just $9.16 to the bale.
