It is also reported that Beloit on May
9th adopted the commission form.
What does commission government
mean?
It means a new deal and
deal to all.
It gives the people a chance to dic
tate their own government.
It does it by making every man di
rectly accountable to every voter in the
city.
It elects city officials as citizens
rather than as ward partisans.
It makes the men elected by the peo
ple individually responsible for specific
duties.
It gives the people the initiative to
make their own laws.
It puts the public service on the ba
sis of efficiency.
It makes off ce attractive for compe
petent men, because it gives the official
a chance to do big things for the city
and make a record.
It says to each city official, "You
have plenty of authority. You can't
dodge. You are in the limelight. Get
busy or get out."
It cuts out the official red tape and
makes the public servants deal directly
with the people.
A reduction in light and water rates,
many long needed improvements are
the results of commission government.
The tax rate was increasing every year
and so was the excess of expenditures
over receipts. Bonds were being is
sued and condition seemed to be grow
ing worse all the time. These things
cannot happen now a3 the commission
form of law makes it an offense for
which commissioners vacate their
offices if they, create or continue an in
debtedness for which there is no in
come to pay.
JUNCTION CITY.
This city has been under the com
mission plan for three years and the
plan has been successful in it's opera
tion. The city is better managed and
more efficiently managed in every de
partment than it wa3 under the old
plan. The city also buys its own bonds,
a thing that has not been done until
1914.
NEWTON.
Bonded debt reduced by $23,131.25
and funds on hand to retire $20,000.00
more.
PRATT.
We believe our success is due to cen
tralization of authority and responsibili
ty given by the commission form of
government under which we are now
operating.
WICHITA.
The results obtained owing to the
greater efficiency of the new form of
city government, not at the time fully
appreciated perhaps, and the general
prosperous condition of our people is
amazing.

We write Hail Insurance
that Insures. Citizens State

It compels the officials to keep an ac
counting system, both of the assets and
liabilities of the city. To keep an ac
curate record of its finances and above
all, it compels publicity so that all may
know where the money goes.
It will lead to a system of govern
ment on a basis as all large business is
governed, a dollar return for every dol
lar spent, and must ultimately result in
lower taxation.
See what the result had been in a few
of the commission go verned cities.
CITY OF HORTON.
Through a reduction in the interest
rate on city obligations, the use of more
careful methods in the collection of dog
tax and poll taxes, and the saving of
interest through the paying off of a
part of the city indebtedness, the
municipal treasury of Horton has been
benefited to the amount of $2145 in the
first eight months operation of com
mission government. The new rule
went into effect Aprii 20, 1915.

To Whom it May Concern:
We, the undersigned, heartily recommend J. M. Schaefer of Hays, Kansas, to all those intend
ing to insure their growing wheat against Hail storms this season. Mr. Schaefer has demonstrated
to us last season that the business entrusted to his care will be honestly looked after. The compa
nies represented by him have treated their customers on the -square in regard to adjustments and
prompt payment of losses. In making this statement voluntary, we feel that we sre not only giving
credit where credit is due, but also in justice to our brother farmers who are looking for a safe place
to do business.

MR. FARMER: -
I submit the above statement for your consideration before placing your insurance this year.
The Almjnac predicts severe hail storms in 1916. Are you prepared? In 1915 we paid more than
50 claims for losses. The smallest was for $100; the largest for $2800, and not one dissatisfied cus
tomer. We have established a record for prompt payment of losses in 1915, why not place your
business with us this year? Don't let the other fellow talk you into insuring with an Irresponsible
Company but see us NOW. What is worth doing at all is worth doing quickly.
Our Pa irons are Our Best Recommendation
Yours for business,
J. M. SCHAEFER.
P. S. We will write your Hail business at cash rates, without interest Our losses will be
adjusted again by our own men, payment being made in the field on day of . adjustment. Does this
sound right to you? , '
H. H. Pierce is sure he is writing as
good Hail Insurance as,any oae "Safety
First" guaranteed. Policy losses paid
promptly and if you want a policy in the
only mutual company in the state,
that paid its losses in full in 1915 (over
$959,800) you can have it in the McPher
son Mutual for less money. '

DEVELOPMENT OF TEE CEILD-ffiXD.
A young tree in the first few years
of it's life must be cared for, shielded
from bruises, knocks, and injuries of
all kinds. It also must be watered and
given earth from which it can obtain
nourishment. After it has grown large
enough so that it's roots reach far into
the soil, artifical support may be with
drawn. It has gained strength enough
to enable it to resist the injuries which
would have b3en fatal while the tree
was small and tender.
Any slight injury to a tree when it is
a small plant will result in a serious de
fect and perhaps a dwarfing of the
growth. The result is a useless shrub,
robbing the earth of its substance, in
stead of a magnificant tree, a thing of
beauty and usefulness.
The child, in the first years of life
must have the assistance and protec
tion of those who are experienced,
whose judgement has been developed
by toil, joy, success or failure.
Every aiiment or complaint of child
hood and youth should be watched and
cared for; the things that seem small
and trivial in children are the things
that may develop into diseased condi
tions which injure beyond repair phy
sically, mentally and morally.
Imngs tnat do not impress the luiiy
developed mind make deep and lasting
impression on the young and imagina
tive mind. The more susceptible a
child's mind to suggestions and in
fluences, the more intelligent is the
child. Any teacher will verify this
statement.
Children should not be started to
school until the mind has reached the
stage of development where it can do a
little more than imitate. This in the
average child is in the seventh or eigth
year.
Wise parents do not sit back con
tentedly and say that their children
will never do so, "and so," because
they have taught them differently;
neither do they condemn other people's
children who have gotten into trouble,
because they understand that it is the
present,, the thing that is now happen
ing that influences young minds, and
for this reason children must be con
stantly surrounded with right influences
Just now it seems that every scenario
editor or whoever is responsible for the
staging of the "movie3, ' has a mania
for cigarette smoking heroes. Prac
tically every Photo hero the last year
has been a "cigarette fiend." Why to
be a man who accomplishes things must
one be an inveterate smoker?
The impression on thousands of boys
between the ages of ten and twenty
has been so strong that they have be
come smokers. You may say "Oh,
they are weaklings," but you are
wrong. They are, in the main, strong
sturdy, intelligent beings endeavoring
to follow those who, to them, are lead
ers in human accomplishments of to
day. Girls and boys should not be over
raised for merit, or praised at all un
ess they deserve it, but, when they are
deserving we should tell them so.
Every one of us appreciate being told
of a good deed we have done; so do
children of all ages, and it -will cause
them to strive for still better accomp
lishment as will nothing else.
Never forget to point out the good
as well as the bad, when criticizing the
efforts of young people and children,
if you would have them believe you are
just and that you really wish to help
them. No one appreciates justice more
than they and no one recognizes it so
quickly.
Perhaps our neighbor, who is not a
child, would also appreciate this.

We have just installed a motor power
home creamery churn and are prepared
to supply some of the demand for good
butter.
This churn is made on the same prin
ciple as the big creamery churns and as
we use only carefully selected first
grade cream this insures a more desir
able butter than regular creamery but

conditions than handmade butter.
