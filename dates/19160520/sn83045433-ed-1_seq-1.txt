'BUSINESS FOLLY" WILL BE
CHARGED BY WILSON'S FOES
X tentative draft of the Reiblican na
tonal platform has been prepared jointly
,y Republican and Progressive leaders.
t embodies principles held both by for
ner President Roosevett and Supreme
curt justice Hughes.
'opies of the tentative drnfttiwill be
nt to Col. Roosevelt and Justice
ughes. if they have not already re
eived them. It was stated yesterday by
Republican Senator who will be one
f the biggest figures in the Chicago
onvention that the platform as tenta
ivelv agreed upon by lro ;ressives and
Republicans meets the views of both Col.
Roosevelt and Justice Hughes.
So far as the Senate Republicans are
oncerned. the opinion seems to prevail
hat the ticket to be nominated at Chi
ago will be:
For President. Charles E. Hughes, of
eow York.
For Vice President, Charles W. Fair
)nks, of ndiana.
Republican leaders claim to have as
iurances that if the convention names
justice Hughes, he will have the sup
ort of Col. Roosevelt. It is even pre
licted by them that a nopiination will be
miade on the third ballot.
The Republican campaigners will lay
tress upon the "business folly" of the
Democratic party as well as on Prest
lent WIlson's foreign policies. They will
harge that if the war had not come in
lit, business conditions four months
fter August of that year would have

In pursuance of a policy to eliminate

Wolf von Igel. former secretary to

York in connection with a riot to blow
up the Welland Canal and his papers

many contended that Von tgel, as a dlplo

The German proposal to settle this acute
controversy has now been suggested by
the German Ambassador. It Is for legal
proceedings against Von Igel to he
dropped and his papers returned on the
understanding that he be recalled and

shows that he was guilty of an offense.
How the State Department will act on
this proposal is not known. The seized
