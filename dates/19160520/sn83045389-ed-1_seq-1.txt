PARIS, May 13 ?Violent fighting on
a large scale was resumed on the Ver
dun front last night Two fresh divi
sions of titrmun troops attached
French positions at Avoeourt wood and
hill 304, west of the Meuse The War
Ofllce announce- th' attacks in the
main were unsuccessful, although the
Germans obtained a footing m a small
post south of lull "ST. which lies just
to the east of Avni.otirt wood
The Germans attempted t<> i? . apt tiro j
the small fort mi tlie northeast slope
of hill 304. which the French took on
the preceding da*. b :t their effort
failed.
Infantry lighting ?*as omi lined for the
most part to the tor west of the
Meuse Kast of the river and in the
Woevre the artillery was active.
The official statement says that the
troops employed by the German? in
their attacks had recently heen sent
to the Verdun front.
Sublieutenant Navarre, one of the [
best known French aviators, who re- J
cently engaged in a light with live tier
man aeroplanes, brought down his j
tenth machine in an aerial combat at j
Dolante, in the Argonne.
The text of the statement follows:
"In the western part of the Argonne j
region the enemy has endeavored to j
penetrate a small salient of our line J
at a point near St Hubert This at - j
tempt was made after the explosion of j
a mine. Our ? urtain of lire checked ?
the Germans decisively and they were j
thrown hack into their trendies.
"On the left bank of the River Meuse
yesterday evening German forces re
newed their attacks in the vicinity of
Avoeourt wood and hill Hill. These at
tack."; were of extreme violence. In
them participated large numbers oT j
men belonging t<? two divisions re- i
cently arrived on the field The enemy
found it impossible to dislodge us from
our positions in the Avoeourt wood
and w est of hill .1" I Nevertheless, on
the center the enemy were able to oc
cupy a small work south of hill -87.
Several endeavors to continue their
progress at this point were definitely
checked by the French lire. On the
?northeast slope of hill .'HM an endeavor
|o recapture the small fort taken by
us yesterday resulted in failure.
"On the right bank of the River
Meuse and in the Woevro district there
was moderate activity on the part of
the artillery.
"Enemy aeioplanes during the night,
of May 18-10 threw down three bombs
on Ger&rdemer. The material damage
was insignificant. A German aeroplane
TTflB brought down yesterday by one of
our pilots near St. Mcnehould; the
enemy aviators .were taken prisoner.

that you have the right to vote for

"I am a great believer in party organ
ization. I believe in strict adherence
to overv partj obligation, and I would
feel bound to vote for any partj nonil
nee voted for at the polls. But in this
instance you are asked to vote for a
man whom the people showed they did
not want. The fact that one of the
nominees named sit the polls is dead
does not give title to any one else
This nominee died, and the sift of the
ofller comes back lo the people. If
the t'ity Democratic Committee had
been compelled to lill the ollice by it<

the appointment to the next highest

the committee was not"' confronted by j
such an occasion. The part* commit

enemy, to balance the scales of justice i
among its own followers and to uphold
the party law. And if in this cast- the
committee bad been compelled to take
action, in order to defeat tho candidate
of a rival party, it would have been'
your duty lo support that nominee
