REPUBLICANS
Becoming Less Afraid of Roose
velt and Now Openly Attack
Him.
G. O. P. Editor Cites Teddy's
Losing Fights In the Past
Few Years.
Confidence Duo to Fact That
President "Wilson Is Not
Improving Position.
CANDIDATES FOR NEXT YEAR
The Republican leaders and their
followers In the East have begun
to fight Ropsevelt openly In the past
few days and are delivering some
hot broadsides In regard to his
candidacy. Several weeks ago the
Roosevelt organs launched a cam
paign for Teddy and opeply dared
the G. O. P. to repudiate him, the
bluff working at first, but now the
Republicans have taken courage and
are In the attitude of telling him
to go and do his "durndest," as they
will -win without him, and are sin
cere In believing that ho can't hold
the Progressive strength In line.
The following Is a sample of the
Republican opinion and Is taken
from the card of a Massachusetts
Republican editor to the New York
Sun:
"This year what happened to
Roosevelt and his friends In Cali
fornia? The regular Taft Republi
cans refused to compromise with
them in any way, Ignored them en
tirely, with the result that the
regular Republicans carried the
primary by 50,000 plurality.
"What happened to Roosevelt and
his friends In Massachusetts? They
wore snowed under In the primary.
"What happened to Roosevelt In
New York in 1914? He stumped
every county in the State and at
tacked Gov. Whitman as Barnes
candidate and tried to defeat him,
with the result that Whitman was
elected by 145,000 plurality.
"In the State of Pennsylvania the
same year Roosevelt attacked Sen
ator Penrose, who was a candidate
for United States Senator, with the
result that Penrose was elected by
236.000 plurality.
"This proves that when a man Is
wrong he can not repeat his wrong
and the people who were misled in
1912 can not be misled In 1916.
The people of this country have
made up their minds to elect a Re
publican President, and if the Chi
cago convention has the good sense
and sound judgment to nominate n
straight out Republican there will r
be no such thing as defeat for tho
Republican party in this campaign.
1U IIUIIUUUIU uu uyuBiuiu WUUIU uu
suicide."
Now for the Democratic stand
point. Conceding that Wilson will
be renominated, the conservative
men In the partv are beginning to
ask themselves If ho will bo strong
enough to defeat a Republican nom
inee outside of Roosevelt. There
can bo no Question but that Wilson
has lost ground in the last several
weeks, regardless of the nro-Engllsh
press who are busy dally abusing
and spurning the "hyphenated
vote," as they term It, and claim
all of the rest for Wilson. The
policy of tho administration In Mex
ico hasn't won a single friend for
the Democratic party. The hagglln.g
with Carranza while the other cut
throat was allowed to get further
away disgusted pretty nearly every
one. Then the pro-English attitude
of Wilson and his Cabinet drove the
German-American vote, of whldh It
must be conceded there "was 20 n?r
cent, at least of that vote In the
Democratic party, and the last but
not least is threatened loss of to
Irish-Amorlcan vote and support be
cause of the statement made and
not successfully denied that Roger
Casement and his friends were be
trayed Into the hands of tho British
by tho Wilson administration. That
this is believed by many is shown
In the overflow mass meetings in
Now York City and elsewhere this
week when Wilson's name was
roundly hissed. Again our President
has ever been ready to protest
against the massacre of Armenians,
tho persecution of Jews in Russia
and the treatment of Belgians, but
to dato there has been no expression
from him concerning the cold-,
mooacu muraer oi me lnsn revolu
tionists by John Bull, or protest at
the action of his English friends In
carrying the man Connolly from a
hospital and bracing him against
tho wall -to be shot. This pretty,
near expiuiuu wuy uiu nuyuuncaua
believe they can win without Teddy,
as they see Wilson getting weaker.
A group of local Democrats tho
other day in discussing the State
convention to bo held at Lexington
Wednesday predicted that all would i
bo harmonious and drifted Into dis-
cueslon of next year's municipal
election. One man was of the opin
ion that Sheriff Charley Cronan
would make a pretty good candidate
for the Democrats to select as their
Mayoralty timber, while others
Bpokp of Charley Grainger, ex
Mayor Head, Peter Lee Atherton
and Ben Washer. Drifting from
that office it was the unanimous
opinion that Loralne Mix would be
about tho strongest timber available
for County Judge, while Will Holley
would make a strong contestant in
seme 'county raee.
KNIGHTS SET BXASIPLB.
One of the . councils ol the
Knights of Columbus in an Eastern
'oltf hac adopted a very beautiful
mannr of rememborins their de
cmm4 members. Instead of snd-
ing a floral tribute this council has
decided to send $15 to tho Catholic
Church Oxtenslon Society, McCor
mlck building, Chicago, upon the
death of a brother member for tho
purchase of a chalice In his mem
ory, to be sent to some poor mis
sion. The chalice will bear the
name of the member in whose mem
ory it is given, as well as the namo
of the council who gave it. This Is
an example worthy of Imitation by
many of our other Catholic organizations.

BUGBEAR
How the Scpcration of Church
and State Is Being Interfered
With.
Silly Claims of Those Who Are
Hostile to tho Catholic '
Itcllgion.
Object to Use of Public Institu
tions For Any Exclusive
Propaganda.
THE PROPER AND ONLY STAND
The separation of State and
Church Is a matter much insisted
upon in- this country. It is de
clared to bo an important feature
of the American idea. "Patriots"
declaim loud and long on the dan
ger or Us nullification by tho forces
of Rome. That Catholicism will
destroy this happy condition of af
fairs in America has been repeatedly
announced to us. It Is in fact one
of the bugbears of the anti-Catholic
campaign. Little Is said, how
ever, of the encroachments of
Protestantism on this principle.
This is not because much could not
be said. In our State Institutions
and our public schools the non
Catholic denominations have been at
work for some time to make these
places centers of Protestant propa
ganda. The proposal for Bible read
ing in tho schools is one phase of
this movement. Weakened as they
have been Tjy their endorsement of
the present system of public instruc
tion, they are endeavoring to re
coup by taking over the products
of this system for tho advancement
of their own ideas at tho expense
oi the state.
In the agricultural colleges has
this practice been particularly
marked. This the Ceneral Bureau
of the Central Vereln has noted be
fore. The rural Protestant church
Is falling into decay. It has been
deeply Injured by tho conflict with
Its rival churches of other denomin
ations. It Is seeking now to resus
citate itself through the assistance
which tho State agricultural col
leges can give it. At Purduo Uni
versity, the State Institution of In
diana, for example, an annual
church conference was held during
tno present month. Not one Cath
olic pi Jest was on the programme,
last year not one was even Invited
to the meeting. It Is plainly a
gathering In tho Interest of the
Protestant rural churches and the
extension and upbuilding of their
work in the rural communities.
Bulletins sent out from the uni
versity have announced this confer
ence as taking place on the dates
set forth. Surely .this Is directly
aiding sectarian enterprises In their
activities. These efforts to
strengthen the Protestant country
churches through State aid and the
focusing of attention on their
problems through conferences under
State auspices Is not of entirely re
cent origin. It dates back to a
number of years ago. The monthly
bulletin of the Missouri State
Board of Agriculture for April,
1914, in its report of the Missouri
Country Llfd Conference, shows
that a great part of tho conference
was devoted to the problems of the
Protestant churches. The first
speaker on the programme dwelt
upon tho weakening of the churches
through "tho old sectarian spirit"
and of tho need of burying tho dlf-
lerences wnicn had led to this con
dition of affairs. "The Church in
Country Life Development,"
"Church Administration," "The Lad
donla Plan and Its Purpose," deal
ing with tho problems of rebuilding
the church, were among the sub
jects discussed, all being treated by
Protestant ministers. In addition, a
professor from the Bible College,
conducted in conjunction with the
Slate University at Columbia, to
which publicity has been given by
that institution, spoke on "Means
of Rural Progress"." It waB a thor
oughly Protesfant programme, and
the speeches were published In full
by the State of Missouri and dis
tributed by It.
All who are conversant with
country life problems must admit
that tho church Is an Important
factor in answering the questions
which those problems present. The
strengthening of the church and the
extension of Its social activities in
the community is much to be de
sired. But such assistance can not
come In the form of aid to sectar
ian endeavors carried on under
State auspices. All of the people
of tho community Catholics and
Jews and unbelievers contribute
to the funds which support our pub
lic institutions. They most logically
can object to the use of these in
stitutions for the exclusive propa
ganda of any particular portion of
the community, no matter how well
intended the efforts thus aided may
be. This Is a point on which we
must emphatically insist. Catholics
will continue to oppose this effort
to make our public educational es
tablishments annexes to Protestant
activities. This is the proper and
only stand for them to take. In
all our Commonwealths the Catholic
inhabitants should be alert and de
mand that these attempts on the
part of Protestant bodies to gain
assistance through public agencies
should cease. And such cessation,
It may bo said, should take place at
once. C. B. of C. V.
WILL SING FIRST MASS.
On next Thursday,jMay 25, at
9:30 o'clock, in tOTmornragt tho
Rev. James J. Maloney will be or
dained to the holy priesthood by
the Right Rev. Denis O'Donaghue,
Bishop of Louisville, at St. Mary
Magdalene church, Brook and Col
lege, and on the following Sunday,
May 28, at 10:30 a. m., he will
celebrate his first solemn mass at
Sacred Heart church, Seventeenth
and Broadway. His pastor, the
Rev. Patrick Walsh, will preach tho
sermon; Rev. Joseph McAleer will
act as deacon, Rev. Joseph Wlcklo
as subdeacon, and Rev. John Fallon
will bo the master of ceremonies.
Father Maloney entered upon his
studies in the college at St. Meinrad,
ind., in September, 1905, Imme
diately after finishing school In the
parish where he will now have tho
happiness of celebrating his first
solemn mass. He is the son of
Garrott and Hannah Dougherty
Maloney, and has a wide circle of
friends in this city.
SACRED HEART CIICRCH.
Everybody is planning to attend
the May festival and candy pulling
for the benefit of the Sacred Heart
school, which takes place Monday
afternoon and evening in the school
hall at Seventeenth and Broadway.
For this event the ladies of tho
Altar Society have been working
very quietly but very efficiently, and
equally successful are the managers
of the country store. The afternoon
will be given over to the children,
and genial company Insures a most
enjoyable evening to the great num
ber df people who will make this
the occasion for a reunion of old
and new friends of Rev. Patrick
Walsh and the parish. There will
be booths, wheels and refreshments,
and all who attend are assured a
really good time. This Is the only
affair given by the Sacred Heart
church during the year, and always
brings out a large gathering.
HAD HAPPY DAY.
Last Sunday was a happy day for
the little children sheltered at St.
Joseph's Orphanage. It was their
annual celebration and an event
looked for with intense interest. The
orphans were brought Into the city
and were met at St. Boniface church
by the Knights of St. John, Cath
olic Knights Uniform Rank and tho
St. Joseph Orphan Society, who
acted as escort to St. Elizabeth
church, where Rev. Father Assent
and his people had prepared an
elaborate reception. Quite a num
ber of Louisville priests assisted at
the solemn vespers and benediction,
and an eloquent and feeling sermon
was preached by the Rev. H. J.
Rothheut, pastor of St. Francis of
Assist church. After the services
the orphans were entertained at
dinner, when they rendered several
pleasing numbers in appreciation of
the treatment accorded them.
FORTY HOURS.
Tomorrow morning the Forty
Hours' Adoration will begin at St.
Columba's church with a solemn
high mass, with the Rev. Father
John. Kalaher, the pastor, as the
celebrant. These impressive devo
tions will continue until Tuesday,
and while they continue a number
of visiting priests will assist Father
Kalaher.
t
CONFUSION
Over What Is Meant by the
Temporal Power of tho
Pope.
Well That Position of tho Holy
Father Should Bo Clearly
Understood.
Roman Pontiff Should Bo Inde
pendent of Every Civil
Power.
EMPTINESS OF THE GUARANTEES
Almost dally every week messages
appear in the dally press to tho
effect that this belligerent power
or that has entered into a compact
with tho Vatican by which the
temporal power of the Pope Is to
bo restored. On the subject of
temporal power of the' Pope there
Is much confusion of thought, and
(t Is well that the position of the
Holy Father should be clearly un
derstood. On September 20, 1870,
tho Italian forces entered Rome
through a breach in the walls of
the city at the Porta Pla, and de
prived the Pope of the temporal
sovereignty that had been held
and exercised In the interests of
the Catholic church and Christian
civilization for over a thousand
years. There was no element of
worldly ambition In the assumption
of temporal sovereignty on tho part)
of the Popes. Once Europe was
converted to Christianity, tho
temptation arose among temporal
eoveroigns to acquire and use the
spiritual influence of the Pope for
the promotion of political objects.
Even if such pressure were not
brought to bear tho fact of the
Popo being a citizen of any par
ticular power would give rise to
the presumption In outside nations
that when acting in his spiritual
capacity he would bo swayed by the
political allegiance. The one and
enly satisfactory means that has
ever been devised for delivering the
Catholic church from such diffi
culties was to make the Pope a
temporal sovereign, with a territory
Independent of the temporal powers.
And a temporal sovereign the Holy
Father was through the centuries
until his power was destroyed and
the rights of Catholics throughout
the world violated by the atheistical
Government of Italy.
A protest was made by Catholics
against the unwarranted attack
upon tho independence of the Pope
and Italy's answer to the protest
was the "Law of Guarantee." What
is that law? On May 15, 1871, the
Italian Parliament passed a law
whereby the Pope's person was to
be sacred and inviolable; Insult or
Injury to the Pope was to be treated
on a par with the Insult or Injury
to the King's person; royal honors
were to be paid to the Pope; he
was to have the right to tho cus
tomary guards; the Popo was to
receive an annual endowment for
tho needs of the Papal court and
the upkeep of the churches; the
Vatican and Lateran palaces, as
well as tho Villa of Castol Gon
dolfo, wore to remain the property
of the Pope. These articles were
to Bssure the Pope and all engaged
In the spiritual government of tho
church, as well as the College of
Cardinals assembled In conclave,
complete liberty of communication
with the Catholic world and exemp
tion from Interference with their
letters, papers and the like.
How have these guarantees boen
observed? PJus IX. knew that
tbero was no Intention on the part
of the usurper that they should be
'kept, and that they wero simply a
devise to hush up tho protests that,
ctfd been called forth throughout
the world and which threatened un
pleasant consequences to Italy. The
stipulations of tho law were sub
mitted to him before they oame
to Parliament and his criticism
was;
"It is no easy task to decide
whether absurdity, cunning or con-1
tempt .played he largest pSft lufe: - a a ir iAir
devising tlfem." . - vrHAlF HADF
And Pius IX. was rinhtX ."The an"-'
nual endowment .has never bae'n
claimed and has of course never
been paid. It is only .those "who
vlalt Rome realize the Invidious
pdjfltton. of the Holy ,vFatheiand
the emptiness ofthe guarantees of
tho Government. 'Cartoons Insulting
the Pope are iflaunted openly and
in .'Derlodicals like tho Nnnvn
Antolgla and tho Rlvlsta Massonlca
I the most scandalous, attacks are
made on him.
Indeed -only ten years after the
law was enacted the' Government
failed to protect, the. funeral pro
cession of Plus ,Xi to the Basilica
of St. Laurence, and allowed the
mob to organize a hostile demon
stration and to attempt to throw
tho body of the dead Popo Into the
fiber.
Every Pope who has been raised
to tho chair since then has given
expression to protests similar to
those of (Plus IX., In tho encyclical,
'Ad Beatlsslml." Our present Holy
rather, Benedict XV., says: "Too
long has the church been curtailed
of Its necessary freedom of action,
ever since the head of the church,
the Supreme Pontiff, began to lack
that defence of his freedom which
(he providence of God had raised
up during the course of centuries
Tho loss of that protection has in
evitably caused no light anxiety In
the Catholic body; for all the chil
dren of the Roman Pontiff, whether
near or living afar, have a right
not to be left in doubt concerning
the possession of their common
father of a true and undeniable
freedom In the exercise of his
apostolic ministry." In 1905 Plus
X. wrote: "It Is of vital Importance
for the Roman Pontiff to be In
eallty and In the opinion of tho
public In every way Independent of
every civil power, and to assure
this no other means has so far
been found except the establishment
of an Independent territory."
CENTENNIAL AT BARDSTOWN.
During the second week in July
will be celebrated the hundredth
anniversary of St. Joseph's church
in Bardstown, the first Cathedral of
this diocese, and arrangements are
under way to honor the occasion
with fitting and Imposing ceremon
ies, worthy of tho founders of this
historic house of worship. No
church west of tho Allegheny
Mountains has a more eventful his
tory, or Is more dearly loved by tho
Catholic world than this time hon
ored and classic structure in which
many of the ablest divines of the
denominations In this country have
labored, and which is not only a
landmark In the geography of tho
State, but a monument to those
early Catholic pioneers who gave to
this church some of its most bril-
Jliant-llgntir'nnd'made-the-'p'res'ent
beautiful edifice possible. A statue
commemorative of the santlflcatlon
of the church Is being erected a few
yards In front of the massive stone
steps that lead up to tho entrance.
This statue Is to be life size, sur
mounting a massive cut stone pedes-
ital, and will bo in perfect keeping
with the other statues now In front
'of tho church. The foundation and
base are now being constructed and
are massive and substantial in the
.extreme, for as Rev. C. J. O'Connell
'says, "Ho Is not building for today,
but for the future." The work of
(construction Is well under way and
will bo completed In ample time
for tho centennial.

Efforts For Reconciliation Be

on tho Charge of High
Treason.
ASQUITH FOR PRIVY COUNCIL
Hopes are now entertained that
martial law will soon be repealed
In Ireland and conditions will have
reverted to their normal state. At
any rate. It should be possible to
dispense with all exceptional meas
ures by July, In which event tho
great annual pilgrimage of the Reek
takes place. Tho Reek, known as
Croagh Patrick, is tho Mount Zlon
of the Emerald Isle. For on its
summit St. Patrick is said to have
wrung from tho angel many prom
ises for the salvation of the people
he had made his own.
From London tho news up to
Thursday was to the effect that
while Premier Asqulth remains in
Ireland seeking a solution of tho
Irish problem, efforts are being
made on the English side of the
Irish Sea to bring together Sir Ed
ward Carson, the Ulster leader, and
John Redmond, leader of the Na
tionalists, in the hopo that a
reconciliation of the opposing fac
tions may be effected. As far as
can be learned there have been no
negotiations thus far, but It Is con
sidered; a favorable sign that Union
ists nnd home rule supporters are
working together and making sug
gestions for a compromise.
The Manchester Guardian says
that David Lloyd-George Is about to
take an active part in the effort
for a settlement. It is said ho has
already met Sir Edward Carson and
Joseph Devlin, Irish Nationalist
member for Belfast, and that he
has an engagement to meet Red
mond. The Guardian addB that
Lloyd-George's scheme for a com
plete settlement on home rulo lines
would have powerful support In
the Unionist press and that this
section of the Unionist prow would
notBupnort anyu bitter lrnjcqn
clltabllly on the part of the Ulster""
Unionists. Tho Unionists press of
London, with tho exception of the
Morning Post, which ds strongly
pro-Ulster, Is urging a settlement.
Early In tho week It was cabled
from Dublin that Premier Asqulth's
visit to Ireland, as far as is ascer
tained, has been confined to fre
quent conferences with tho civil and
military officials. The suggestion,
unofficially circulated, regarding the
possibility of the formation of an
Irish Executive Council for tho
management of tho government of
Ireland until tho end of tho war,
appears to have made a good Im
pression In Ireland. There has been
much discussion of the subject In
nil quarters, but no confirmation of

The following Is an account of
the death of James Connolly, sent
out Saturday from Dublin:
The hand of death has kindled
the flamo of fury in all Ireland.
There's muttering in the streets
here and a threat In conversation.
For the English have shot poor,
wounded James Connolly. He was
hurt when he went out. His leg
was In splints and those splints
were honorable to the Irish. For
James Connolly fell in the fighting
around the Postoffice when Ireland
struggled for freedom. Connolly
was Commander-in-Chief of the
Irish army of revolt. A firing squad
filed out. They carried Connolly
out on a stretcher. And they stood
him against a wall. He couldn't
stand alone, so they let him make
a crutch of a gun. Connolly was
pale when he faced them. Tho gray
wall behind was reflected In his
face. But It was not fear. It was
the pallor of the prison and the sick.
When tho volloy rippled away and
died tho British uncovered. Brave
men admire brave men, enemies
though they may be. And they're
burying him In a traitor's grave,
PLEASANT SURPRISE.
