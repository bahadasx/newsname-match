WASHINGTON, I). C, May 10
By an overwhelming vote, 349
to 25,' the -'house 'of representatives
today adopted the reconstructed
amy bill, providing for reorgani
zation of the regular array. The
adoption of the report of the con
ference committee was not marked
by1 any sensational features.
Army, circles on Oahu have
awaited the action of the house
,with keen interest, but little anx
iety, since the passage of the com
promise bill was practically' as
sured after the house and senate
conferees announced their agree
' xnent. '
The revised figures give a peace
strength of 211,000 men, a war
strength of 261,000, including all
special troops, staff, etc. The war
strength of the line will be about
236,000; The militia is to be re
organized with a total of 457,000,
which may be expanded to
718,500.- - . ' ur-;v':- -

Five auto drivers who appeared be
fore the. judge this mOlng 'wire re
leased from charges of driving on the
wrong aide of Kalakaua avenue when
they explained that the right aide was
practically impassable. A few days
ago eight defendants were released
under similar circumstances.
"Why do you continue with these
arrests, the judge asked Motorcycle
Policeman - Chilton this morning,
"when you understaad the circumstan
ces and know the disposition of the
court In thig. matter?"
"I'm only acting under 'instructions
from 'the sheriffs office," Chilton
told him.
The Judge told the defendants that
he drove a car himself and he knew
well enough the condition of the ave
nue In many places.
TMy Instructions to all auto drivers
is' to use their "ftwn judgement as to
which aide of the avenue to take.
said the Judge, lf It looks bad on Ihe

.When Deputy Asch was asked if
. arrests on Kalakaua avenue would be
discontinued he jumped clear out of
his chair and hit his desk with both
fists. . -r :..'. '
;"Do you think for a minute that I
am going to tell my men dot to en

having traffic policemen and motor
cycle men if they are to overlook vio

judge Bees fit to discharge the defend
ants when they come before him it is
no business of mine, but as long as
there la a rule against driving on the
left side of the street we will arrest
everyone who doesn't adhere to it"
;- Mr. Asch stated further that it was
his belief kalakaua avenue was as
bad on one side as on the other in
most place8.
"The trouble with a lot of the au-
tomobtle men 'Is that they can't go
fast enough on the bumps," said Mr.
Asch. ."I'm not denying the road Is
bad, but I have driven over worse
places at a' moderate speed with no

Simultaneously the governor makes
publ.c the results fruitless so far
of efforts to secure a home for the

that the juveniles were properly

That the boom of Gen. ; Wood bad

ported by the Star-Bulletin on Miyl.'
Letters from a New Yorker, John
Stewart of 233 Broadway, outlined ta
glowing terms the qualities of Geo.
Wood as a presidential, candidate ea

The letters said that friends of Cn.

follows: , ;:
"We need not say that Gen. Wood
