WATERWORKS
MEETS DEFEAT
BY MISREPRE
SENTATION
Alarming Tales of Immense
Cost Frighten Small Prop
erty Holders Against.
21 NEGROES VOTED
AGAINST; 1 VOTED FOR
While Election Was Lost in
Number of Votes It Was
Carried in Amount.
The waterworks election last Tues
day was defeated in number but
won in property value. The vote
was: For--Assessed property value,
$134,610; number of votes, 113.
Against--Assessed property value.
$119,862; number of votes., 138.
There was one spoiled ballot.
The election was lost largely
through the opposition of Mr. E. J.
Frederick and lack of organized ef
fort to carry it. Mr. Frederick had
stated that he would not work
against waterworks, and while it was
known that he was not .in favor of
it, he being interested in the present
waterworks system, his declaration
that he would not work against it
was accepted in good faith and it was
anticipated that the election would
carry. There were also a few prop
erty holders who did all in their
power to defeat it, the Finneys being
very active. Arguments used against
it were unfair in the extreme, as it is
reported that it was represented it
would cost $100 to make connec
c tions; that they would be compelled
to take out old hydrants and put in
new; that they would be taxed 10
mills; that it meant that new side
walks would have to be put down.
water-closets put in, etc. Of course
to the property-holder of moderate
means these things were alarming.
There 4s little doubt that if there
had been an individual canvass an(
each property-holder had been made
to understand just what the cost
would be, and to realize what the
benefits would be, there would have
'been no trouble in carrying the
election.
At the time the question came nil
for waterworks and sewers, it was
endeavored to reach an agreement
between the town and the St. Tam
many Ice & Manufacturing Co.,
which furnishes the town's supply
of water, to take over the property
of the water system. The following
minutes of that meeting ahow the
action taken:
Covington, La., Dec. 17, 1915.
The following committee, appoint
ed by and representing the Associa
tion of Commerce, E. G. Davis, chair
man; Harvey E. Ellis, E. J. Do
mergue, Jacob Seller and R. L. Au
bert, in conjunction with the Mayo
and Aldermen, as follows: P. J.
Lacroix, Mayor, D. I. Addison, Emile
Frederick, J. E. Nilson and A. R.
Smith, and E. J. Frederick, Chas.
Jenkins and Thos. M. Burns, appear
ing in behalf of the St. Tammany
Ice and Manufacturing Company, and
X. A. Kramer, consulting engineer,
all being present, met in joint ses
sion on the above date, at 8 o'clock
p. m., at the office of Thos. M. Burns,
in the Covington Bank & Trust Co.
.building, for the following purposes:
To discuss the advisability in the
event the election to be held January
11, 19116, is carried and the bonds
sold "of purchasing the present ex
isting waterworks system now owned
by and in operation by the said St
Tammany Ice and Manufacturing
Company."
And after a full discussion of the
matter, the following understanding
was unanimously arrived at. to-wit:
That the Mayor and Board of Al
dermen, as soon as the bonds are
sold, pay to the said St. Tammany Ice
and Manufacturing Company, thirty
five hundred ($3500.00) dollars, in
cash, and conceda to said company
the night to continue operating its
present wa,terworks system, for its
account, for a period of one year
from January 1, 1916, at the end of
which year, December 31, 1916, the
said St. Tammany Ice and Manu
acturing Company turn over, sel'
and deliver all of its said waterworkr
system, complete, all pipings, con:
nections, customers, good will etc.
with the exception of its steam pumr
and well.
After i unanimous approval ti
parties present pledged themselves to
Scarry out, In full, the foregoing un
derstanddng.
Attest:
T*IOS. M. BURNS,
RIt. L. AUBERT.
The fact that the sewer proposi
tion was eliminated and that the elec
tion was held only for waterworks.
was not considered to alter the equl
ties of the case, and this part of the
water was supposed to be disposed
of. In fact, the following stockhold
ers of the St. Tammany Ice and Man
fMaturing Co. voted for waterworks:
Wallace M. Poole, Mrs. Wallace M.
Poole, Mrs. Henry Hailer, W. R. Ba
don.
The fire Department, in its parade
carried cartoons appealing to the
ople to give them water with which
to fight fire. After the election a
meeting of the fire companies was
held and it was decided to disband.
Under the chatter thirty days noticq
has to be published of the Intention
and a board of liquidation be ap
pointed. The vote for this action
was taken viva voce, and seemed to
be almost unanimous.
There were rumors on the street
that insurance compandes were can
celling policies. It developed that
while there were a number of poli
eisa cancelled, it was because the
company was withdrawing from the
State.
There were twenty-one negro
property-holders whto voted against
waterworks, and a large number of
proxies were voted against that could
have Juat as easiy been secured to
vote for.

Equalization of Assessments
Without Change of Sytem
One Plan of Governor.
Baton Rouge, La., May 15.-Be
neath the branches of the massive
oaks in the northwest corner of the
State House grounds where a long
line of Louisiana governors have
been inaugurated, Ruin G. Pleasant
took the oath of office as governor of
Louisiana at 12:13 o'clock today.
The oath was administered by Chief
Justice Frank A. Monroe, in the pres
ence of more than 5000 people. Af
ter the ceremony, Gov. Pleasant read
i.s inaugural address.
Squaiization of assessments and
taxatuon without change of system,
eumination of useless offices, aboil
tion of the lee system and the en
couragement of inmaigration and
manuaacturing enterprises were chiet
points in- the address. The nee
governor retrained from discussing
legislation except in the imatter or
assessments apd did not intimate
what lhis legislative program would
be.
The message made no reference t:
liquor legislation. In this connec
tion it is to be noted that Represen
tative Kennet of Washington parish
sprang the anti-near beer bill in the
H-ouse this morning. It is the flra.
of the Anti-Saloon League members
to make its appearance.
It is anticipated the Governor will
have assistance of all in carrying
out his measures.
The inauguration drew to Baton
Rouge the largest crowd in the city's
ihstory. It is estimated that 10,jroL
visitors are within the capital gates
today.
Colonel Pleasant arrived from Neu
Orleans on the kasoo and Misslsuipp
Valley special at 10:25 a. m. Tae
train made the eighty-nine-mile run
from New Orleans in two hours and
twenty minutes, record time for a
train of eleven cars over this road.
A citizens committee, headed o:
T. Sambola Jones, master of cere
monies, met the train and escorted
Colonel Pleasant to a waiting auto
mobile. The car was driven to the
State House where Governor Hall,
Chief Justice Monroe and Lieutenant
Governor Mouton took seats. Col.
Jones was the other occupant. This
car led the inaugural parade which
preceded the induction into office.
Hundreds of Orleans friends and
country supporters who made the
trip by way of the city were on the
special train with the official party.
As the train pulled into the station,
whistles and bells on the river front
and throughout the city joined it
giving the new executive a noisy
welcome.
Following the ceremony on the
State House campus, Governor Pleas
ant was escorted to the executive
parlors by Governor Hall, and there
the new governor held informal re
ception for an hour or more.
At night band concerts at the
State House and the University, a
reception by Governor and Mrs.
Pleasant at the University' Pavilion
and the inaugural ball were the
program of events. IMost of the
