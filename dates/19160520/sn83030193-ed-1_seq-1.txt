CHARLOTTE. -V. C. May 20. !
"Untainted Americanism!" was Pres
ident Wilson's answering cry to-day
to Col. Roosevelt's insistent demand
for "Americanism."
Speaking to a crowd of lOO.OCxi
gathered here to celebrate the 141st
anniversary of the signing of the
Mecklenburg Declaration of Inde
pendence, he eprang fhls phrase amid
oclferous cheers.
"What kind of a fire are you going
to keep burning under the melting
pot of America to turn out untainted
Americanism?" he ajikeO of th de
scendants of the Irish-American pa
triots who signed a declaration of In
dependence more than a year before
that signed by the American Colonies
in JT6.
Mayor Kirkpatrlck, despite appeals
from the crowd to "Sit down!" oc
cupied twenty mlnutu Introducing
Gov. Craig of North Carolina, who
presented tho Presldnt. Tho Prcsl
dent was cheered for five minutes.
'1 do not knorr whether t can In
terpret tho spirit of the occ Ion," the
President said. "Hut It is necessary
for us to take counsel as to just what
It In w wish to celebrate.
"There, were only 3.000,H) people In
the United States when the Mecklen
burg declaration was made; now
there are over a hundred million. But
the same elements were present then
that aro present now. The United
States always has been In proccsa of
being made and there always hare
beon the same elements a high and
handsome passion for human llbe"' .y.
"This country has devoted practi
cally nil of Its attention In past years
to the mutcrial side of ius life. It
Is now a great deal more important
to dotctmlno what we are to do with
our powci. What kind ot tire arc
you going to keep burning under the
melting pot of Amctlra to turn out
untainted Americanism?
"While 'vve were In tho midst of this
piocess there came this great cata
clysm of war. Almost overy nation In
this world became. Involved In the
great struggle. What aro tho clc

national traditions and national poli

nations were growing closer to 'ach
other.
"While these processes ot fermenta
tion and acquaintanceship wcro going
on men were gutting to know each
other better, and now the melting pot
Is greater than America. It Is the
world.
"Now there is room for a co-nrdlna-lion
and co-operation of Interests.
These bad things bring to tho ore
the necessity of getting together and
taking counsel. .Here. In America wo
should tiiko pride In tho spirit which
prompts all the world to get together
In terms of co-operation and peace.
"Now the world outside America Is
asking what aro you going to do with

POOR GIRL'S CLAIM

Judge Orders Mrs. Matters to i
Produce Child in Fight
for Estate.
TAKEN FROM HOSPITAL.
Canadian Young Woman Says
Infant She Supposed
Dead Was Stolen.
CHICAGO, May SP. Federal Judge
K. M. Landls accepted the task of
Solomon to-day and made the Mat
ters baby cae an International prob
lem. On the pica of Margaret Ryan, a
Canadian backwoods girl, the prin
cipal witness against Mrs. Dollle
Ledgerwood Matter?, accused ot
foisting a suprious heir on the courts
In a contest over the estate -of her
millionaire husband, Judfo Ltntlls
Issued a writ of babea Corpus, di
recting Mrs. Matters to produce the
baby In court next Friday.
Pleading that the Infant wai her
"war baby" that had been stolen
from her side at the hour of Its birth
at Mlserlcordla Hospital, Ottawa,
Canada, Margaret told tho Judge she
wanted tho child back. Her counsel
convinced Judge. Land Is that an In
ternational Immigration agreement
betwoon Canada and the United States
prohibits the emigration of a child
without tho consent of Its parents.
In tho Circuit Court a story has been
unfolded which the State contends
proves the Mattora baby the child of
Margaret, who did not consent to
the child's removal to the United
State?.
Margaret was engaged to be married
to a young shoemaker she had known
from childhood, when Great Britain's
call for volunteers was sounded In
Canada. Jn tho turmoil of emotions
und sacrifice. In common with many
other young lovers in war stricken
countries all over the world, they
forgot all considerations except their
coming separation, which might be
forever.
The shoemaker was in the trenches
In rranco when Margaret Ryan found
she was to br tho mother of u "war
baby." Her mother took her to thu
Mlserlcordla Hospital at Ottawa,
paying $25 out of hor eavlngs to havo
tho girl cared for.
A frequent visitor to tho "free,
ward" whero Margaret and other girls
had their tots was Mrs. Matters. She
had a private room, luxuriously fur
ishcd.'in tho hospital. Tha poorer
patients spoke of ber as "The Mil
lionalr Lady."
July 21 Margaret was told her child
had been born qfld. Sho waa moved
to a private room and was attended
by special nurses.
"Sometimes," sh sajd. "thev
brought in tho babies for mo 'o see.
It mado mo feol bud, hut they thought

Four montiis after sho U ft the hospi

ln?r of roadlng in tho newspapers that
Mrs. Matters was charged with claim

July 24 in the Mlserlcordla Hospltul.
