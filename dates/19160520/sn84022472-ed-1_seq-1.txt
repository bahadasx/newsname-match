here for the 141st anniversary of the

by Governor Craig of North Carolina,
who spoke of the President as one ot
the. greatest leaders the nation has
ever seen.
President Wilson, addresing a large
crowd at the railroad station at Salis

Republican party as men who are
' looking backward.' Members of the
President's party declared he was re
ferring to the fight led by Senator Gai-
linger, defeating the nomination of
George Ruble to the federal trade
commission.
"There are other serious things to
be done nowadays, ladies and gentle
men, said the President. "And it is
a' satisfaction to be associated with
men- who know how serious they are
and ' with what spirit they must be
approached, because, whether we will
or not, we are at the beginning of a
new .age for the, world and America
will have to play a very great part
-in that new age. And we will have
to be very wise not to encourage or
give countenance to the men who
are trying to hold us back.
"There are some men, I do not be

Chernock Guards Locked
Door Wth Carving Knife, -But
Is Overcome.
John Chernock, a demented man,
who had stripped himself of clothing
and prepared for battle with the police
in locked rooms at 242- Hallett" street
last' night after driving his family
from the house 'with a butcher knife
was overcome by a surgeon and five
pqlicemen last night after .a furious
battle. He is securely strapped at the
old Hillside home today where he is
improving. "
1 The second precinct police station
was informed shortly after 10 o'clock
last night that Chernock, 25 years of
age, had driven his wife ad little girl
from the house and that, fully armed,
he was awaiting the police.
Emergency Surgeon Weldon was
notified and Policemen William H.
Glennon, William Halpin, John Demp
sey, Timothy Shay, and John McGin-
ness were detailed to assist him.
Arriving at the home they . found
Chernock locked behind doors on the
third floor. Dempsey attempted to
enter through a rear window and was
partly in the room when Chernock
rushed him with a carving knife, the
blow passing ' close to the leg of the
policeman whom pulled himself back
wards . through the window. An at
tempt to force a kitchen door result
ed in a knife jab through the panels.
A council of the attacking party
decided to parley with him through
the window while a skeleton key was
used to open th.e kitchen door. While
the parley held by Surgeon Weldon
was having the result of inducing
Chernock to put on some clothing the
key failed to work by reason of pre
vious force used by the police. -
Finally with Weldon and Dempsey
entering the window in, attack, Hal
pin and his associates broke down the
rear door and CMernock suddenly
found himself attacked on both sides.
In a moment of indetermination'as to
which oficer he would stab with the
knife, his upraised arm was pinioned
by Halpin and a nightstick sent the
knife at some distance to the de
mented man. Chernock became as
meek as a lamb and accompanied the
police without further resistance.

Endeavor to Fix Blama
For Deaths and Injuries
of Victims.
Special to The Farmer)
Ansonia, May 20 President
Julius Stremlau of ftie State
federation of Labor gave an
order today for a strict investi
gation of the source of the or
der that resulted in firing upon
strikers at the plant of the An
sonia Manufacturing Co. Thurs
day. ' ,
Ira M. Ornburn, organizer of
the State Federation, is expect
ed to arrive in Ansonia this ev
ening. Organizers of other
crafts are likely to come to the
city. -
"I shall enquire deeply into this
matter," said Mr. Ornburn today, "and
if guards have been firing on the
strikers from the interior of the fac
tory as reported, there must be some
redress.
"The State Federation will offer its
support to the labor men in Ansonia,
if their cause is just and will see that
justice is done."
The State Federation will also make
an investigation . of police action in
Stamford, where, it is alleged police
men prevent strikers from peaceful
picketing at the garment factories.
The strikers in mass meeting this
noon voted not to return to work. The
decision had a touch of the dramatic
in it. This may have been due to ra
cial characteristics.
Representative Abraham S. Aaron
son, who had been asked by. 'ne strife
era to look after their interests, ad
dressed ,the meeting, urging them to
go into (work Monday, promising that
their wages would be looked after by
Judge Munger and himself. Judge
Munger, for the company, followed
and told the strikers that they
ought to let Mr. Atronson and himself
try and settle the trouble. A Greek,
speaker talked to the Greeks ajid hia
eloquence was such that they imme
diately voted to go back. '
-. The Lithuanians were i next ad
dressed by si man of that tongue and
he argued so forcibly that with a cheer
men of this nationality voted to re
turn. .
The Russian speaker wasl next and
somewhere in his remarks he assert
ed that prospects for a settlement
were- not so good as Messrs. Aaron
son and Munger had said they were.
The Russians were uncertain about
their action and finally refused. to go
in. This action was interpreted to
