PETITIONS-CIRCULARS IN CITY
Appeal to Citizens to Aid Them
in Unfair Treatment.
All Union 3Ien Will Gather at
Labor Hall Sunday.
It was stated at the meeting in labor
hall last night that the State Jour
nal was opposed to the jitneys and
that this paper favored the drastic
ordinance against the motor car ve
hicles and drivers. This statement is
absolutely false. It Is unwarranted
and uncalled for. The State Journal
championed the original appearance
of the new form of transportation in
Topeka and always has and always
will stand up for a square deal in their
dealings with the board of city com
missioners. Their business should be
regulated, not destroyed or unfairly
restricted.
The State Journal is for a square
deal, too, for the street railway com
pany, with its big investment and
good service; but the proposed ordi
nance designed to put the jitneys out
of business is unjust and should not
prevail.
Accompanied by dozens of news
boys, shouting and cheering for them,
applauded by hundreds of good na
tured citizens out of sympathy with
the unfair jitney ordinance, prac
tically every jitney driver in the city
participated in a big parade on Kan
sas avenue and through Topeka's resi
dence section at 2; 30 o'clock this aft
ternoon. Huge printed signs were
tacked to the sides of the jitneys urg
ing upon the public attendance at a
monstrous mass meeting at the audi
torium at 9 o'clock Monday morning
just before the ordinance comes up
for consideration before the commis- j
sion. Other signs asked: I
"Why Drive the Jitney Out of Busi
ness? "Do You Want to Return to Inade
quate Street Car Service?"
; Hand bills further explaining the
jitney men's side of the case were dis
triDuted to the citizens viewing the
parade on both sides of the street.
Jitney horns honked, and lusty news
boys hanging from the sides of the
cars kept up their lusty cheering.
The parade formed at Tenth and
Quincy streets and from there paraded
upon and down Kansas avenue, thence
north to Garfield Park and counter
marched. Union Men Meet Sunday.
A mass meeting of all union men
will be held at 9:30 o'clock tomorrow
morning at Labor hall, 418 Kansas
avenue. The jitney proposition will be
discussed from ail angles at that time.
The meeting has been called by the
executive committee.
Public Mass Meeting Monday.
At 9 o'clock Monday morning a pub
lic mass meeting will be held at the
auditorium to protest against the pro
posed jitney ordinance. This meeting
will be held about an hour prior to the
meeting of the city commissioners
when the ordinance will be placed be
fore the commission for a second
meeting.
At that time the public will be given
a chance to state its side of the story,
the Jitney men will talk and defend
ers of the ordinance may "speak out
in meeting" also.
Since publication of the jitney ordi
nance in last evening's State Journal
the city hall has been beseiged with
protsts.
Bills and Placards.
Thirty jitney drivers, backed by

STATE MAKES DRAFT
Calls on County Treasurers for 10 Per
Cent of Its Funds.
Ten per cent of the year's taxes
were drawn today to meet the state's
bills for May. Drafts totalling $334,
000 were drawn on county treasurer
under orders by W. E. Davis, state
auditor and Earl Akers, state treas
urer. The drafts today make a total of
fifty per cent of the state taxes drawn
to date. In order to meet current ex

on the county treasurers for a portion
of the funds available for this year.
CNCE LIBELED T. R ;
NOW OUT FOR HIM
Detroit, May 20. George A.
Newett, editor of the Ispheming
Iron Ore, has come out for Theo
dore Roosevelt. Newett is the edi
tor whom the colonel sued for libel,
got judgment and a six-cent verdict.
His Army Has Crossed Border
in hut One Place.
FORCE OF OVER 200,000 MEN
Is Being Hnrted Against the
Italian Position.
Great Aerial Actiyity Exists on
the Tyrolean Front.
Rome, May 20. Emulating the ex
ample of the German heir apparent,
the Austrian crown prince has arrived
at Trent and is directing the campaign
against Vicenza, the Verdun of the
northern Italian front.
Field Marshal Holtzendorff, chief of
the Austrian general staff, has joined
the array of generals on the Tyrolese
front. It is reported here that Gen
eral Cadorna, Italian commander in
chief, will move his headquarters to
the Trentino front.
Though last night's official state
ment from the Italian war office ad
mitted further retirement, there is
every evidence here that the Austrian
offensive is about to come to a halt.
Despite heavy sacrifices in men and
ammunition, the Austrians thus far
have crossed the Italian border at but
one point in the Astico valley. At no
place do their lines approach nearer
than 22 miles of the important
strategic position of Vicenza, reported
to be the goal of the present offensive.
Between 200,000 and 250,000 Aus
trian troops are engaged on the front
leading eastward from the Adige val
ley. It is admitted the losses on both
sides have been very heavy thougti no
figures are available at present.
There is reason to believe the Aus
trians hoped to catch the Italians off
their guard while important troop
movements were under way. Under
the heaviest artillery bombardment
the Alpine region has known since
the war began, the Italians were forc
ed to relinquish advance positions in
the first two days of fighting. On the
third day. counter attacks recovered
part of the lost ground. The Austrians
returned to the attack in creat force
on the following day and, rather than
sacrifice men uselessly on exposed
positions, the Italian commander or
dered a further retirement to better
protected positions.
The greatest aerial activity on the
Tyrolese front since the beginning of
the war is accompanying the Alpine
battle.

NO NEED TO SPRAY
It Won't Stop Tree Pest Now,
Says College Expert.
Advises Topekans to Get Busy
Next Winter.
State Forester Scott telephoned
from Manhattan this morning that he
would not come to Topeka to fight the
canker worm which is infesting the
shade trees. "It is too late now to do
any good this year," he said. "The
bugs are falling rrom the trees and
will burrow into the ground there to
remain all winter. Next spring they
will come forth with their young and
the pest will be worse then than now.
"The only thing for Topeka citizens
to do." he said, "is to spray their trees
thoroughly early next spring and to
band the trees this winter. This will
catch any bugs that may venture forth
early.
"I know the situation there in To
peka thoroughly and it is no use for
anyone to spray now," was his mes
sage to Commissioner Porter's office.

Charlotte, X. C, May 20. "Untaint

velt's insistent demands tor "Ameri
canism.' Speaking to a tremendous crowd
gathered here to celebrate the 14 1st
anniversary of the signing of the
Mecklenburg declaration of indepen
dence, he sprung his phrase amid voci
ferous applause.
"What kind of a fire are you going
to keep burning under the melting pot
of America to turn out untainted
Americanism?' he asked the descen
dants of the Irish-American patriot
who signed a declaration of indepen
dence more than a year before that
signed by the American colonies in
1776.
Cheer Wilson 5 Minutes.
Mayor Kirkpatrick, despite pleas
from the crowd to "sit down!" occupied
twenty minutes introducing Governor
Craig of North Carolina, who pre
sented the president. The president
was cheered for five minutes.
"I do not know whether I can in
terpret the spirit of the occasion' he
said. "But it is necessary for us to
take counsel as to just what it is we
wish to celebrate.
"There were only three million peo
ple in the United States when the
Mecklenburg declaration was made;
now there are over a hundred million.
But the same elements were present
then that are present now. The

New York, May 20. Transatlantic

last week. Information received to
day from London by a local firm
stated that reductions of another half
per cent were being made there in
many instances.
This would mean a cutting of the
rates in half since the German reply

USE ONEMAN CARS
Topeka Railway Company Has
Built 24 Types.
Every Line in City Will Be
Given New Equipment.
Topeka citizens will soon witness
the one-man operated street car run
ning on various lines in the city.
Twenty-four cars are now being re
built in the shops of the company,
and in many ways they will be more
pleasing to patrons than are the
largest type cars.
Instead of three windows in front,
two large ones will afford patrons a
clear view of the roadway. The mo
torman will stand squarely in the cen
ter of the forward vestibule. Th )
controller is of the automatic type,
which instantly switches off the cur
rent when the hand of the motorman
leaves the controller. The front door
is controlled by an automatic device,
which opens and closes it. but both
operations depend on th- movement
of the car, for the door will not open
while the car is in motion, nor will
the car start until the door Is closed.
At the rear of the car is an emer
gency door, which can be opened in
case of accident, but this door is
for emergency only. In the rear of
the car a semicircle seat is being
built, which will give it the appear
ance of a sight-seeing car.
Folding Steps.
The step in front is of the folding
type and the entrance will be wide and
roomy. Passengers will pay as they
enter.
The interior of the cars are pleas
ing. The ceiling is of white enamel
and the marine type of lighting is
being installed. Oak is used for finish.
An innovation in headlights will be
introduced on the new cars. Two of
them, in place of the customary one,
will be placed, one on each side, close
to the top, on the-front. They are so
arranged that they will shine, not only
on the roadbed, but well to each side
and downward, thereby eliminating
the dead level glare close to the street.
This feature will not only be appre
ciated by Topeka citizens but by many
hundred automobilists as well, as it
will help eliminate accidents resulting
from night blindness caused by the
glare of electric headlights.
The new cars are to be well marked,
both front and rear, as to route and
street, thereby assisting patrons to dis
tinguish the car desired from a dis
tance. When complete, the new cars
will cost the company approximately
$3,000 each.

Governor Capper today appointed
Dr. O. F. Marcotte of Topeka as coro
ner for Shawnee county. The appoint
ment is made for an unexpired term.
Dr. Marcotte to succeed Dr. J. H.
Rinehart, resigned.
The appointment of Dr. Marcotte

two hours after Dr. Rinehart went to
the state house with his resignation.
The resignation was delivered to the
overnor in his office, the official
stating that he expected to leave
Shawnee county and move to Abilene.
Appointment of Dr. Marcotte as suc
cessor to Dr. Rinehart was strongly
urged by a number of Topekans and
the appointment is probably one of the
most popular local appointments made
by the governor.
A Smallpox Hero.
During the smallpox epidemic In
Topeka four years ago. Dr. MarcoLte
voluntarily took charge of the situa
tion. It was largely due to his per
sonal efforts and almost tireless work
that the spread of the disease was
checked. His record in the smallpox
fight gave him an unusually strong
following here. It was largely because
of his record during the smallpox
epidemic that Governor Capper was
today led to give Dr. Marcotte the
job.
"Dr. Marcotte's working during the
smallpox epidemic was little short of
marvelous and it was because of this
work that I was largely influenced to
appoint him," said Governor Capper.
"He was strongly endorsed and I be
lieve he will be an excellent official."
The appointment is effective im
mediately. INCOME TAX UP

As forecast In the State Journal a
few days ago. the Topeka Edison com
pany will pay into the city treasury
$3,169.62 as tax due the city for the
past two years, according to a report
filed at the city hall. This represents

the plant at $1,13S, 008.11 for the year
19914 and at $1,156,467.40 for the year
