BRITISH STOP
GERMAN ATTEMPT
TO CROSS YSER
Thrust at Lines in Flanders
North of Ypres Is Beaten
Back
QUIET AT VERDUN
Raiding Plane Brought Down;
Six Killed at Dunkirk;
Fighting in Champagne
With comparative quiet prevailing
at Verdun, the Oermans last night
made a thrust at the British lines In
Flanders, attempting to cross the Yser
canal north of Ypres . The French
war office, which reports the attempt,
declares that it failed.
The sector picked for the attack Is
one that would naturally be chosen by
the Germans for an effort to break the
Itritlsh front and drive toward Calais.
Some of the fiercest fighting of the war
has taken place along the Yser during
previous German attempts to advance
toward the English channel.
Activity has also been displayed by
the Germans in other sectors of the
western front, notably in a gas attack
in the Champagne region, which Is
also declared to have been fruitless.
There have been numerous raids by
Germaji aircraft. Three seaplanes
raided the British east coast, but ac
cording to the British announcement
they caused but a few casualties «ind
lost one of their machines, which was
brought down off the Belgian coast.
An aeroplane attack on Dunkirk and
Bercue* resulted in the killing of six
persons and the wounding of thirty
eight other*.
Aocordlng to to-day's Turkish official
report, there has been little fighting of
importance between the Turkish and
Russian armies fronting each other In
the Caucasus and Mesopotamian cam
paigns.

"There are some men, I do not believe

j are looking backward, not forward,
i They do not know the problem of the
