ger. Before beginning his formal .ad
dress Dr. Cohen spoke in terms of
high commendation concerning the
public school system of Oklahoma and
Chickasha, paying a glowing tribute
to the faculty of the high school for
their efficiency and untiring efforts
in behalf of the cause of education.
Facing the class he then spoke in part
as follows:
"A man's life Is determined by his
Ideals. In this world no man ever
achieves what he does not aim for.
We measure men's heights by the
depths from which they have ascend
ed. Ideals, are tho moulding factors
of life they are the creative forces
of heroic achievements. 'To the dul
lard,' George Elliot says, 'ideals are
often poor ghosts; their sun-filled
eyes cannot discern them; they pass
before them in a vapor.' How differ
ent with the educated man. Why,
Ideals arc what men live by. They
are the springs of character, the lad
der by which aspiring souls climb
through darkness to tho throne of the
universe. In a most vital sense a
man's life is driven by his ideals.
They are the fructifying, forces of the
spiritual order. Imbued with them
Greece and Rome flourished. When
spurned by them for the sensual
hours of leisure and bacchanalian de
baucheries, their civilizations crum
bled ,into ruin. My friends, earth
knows no tragedy, like the death of
the soul's ideals!
"Hear me tonight! Your youth is
doomed unless you have large plans,
Be not like the young man that Low
ell tells us of, who recklessly threw
away the 'apples of Hesperides' and
later shook the heavens with his la
mentations of regret and died a broth
er to the ox. He only reaped what he
sowed! Knowthis, the power to rise
is only given to those who fear not
the heights. We are not animals
that we should Btoop to feed upon the
things that flourish at our feet. We
are not mute beasts that we should
grunt our lives out digging at the sor
did roots of the world. We are born
to higher things. Our destiny is
marked out for us by tho stars. You
will not succeed in touching them
with your. hands, but like the seafar
ing man on deserts of water, you "will
choose them as your guides and fol
lowing them reach your destination.
."The development of character Is
the end of all true education. Great
men are measured by character! It

ASK MORE
FUNDS FOR
SCHOOLS
Special Election is Called for May 31 to
Authorize Extra Levy of One
Mill Necessary for Main-
tenance
In accordance with a call issued by
the board of education, a specif elec
tion will bo held on May 31, at which
time the voters will be asked to au
thorize an additional tax levy of one
mill. ,
The same umoinit was requested
and granted in tho special election
that was held last year. After care
ful calculations the board ascertained
that the regular levy provided by
law would not furnish adequate rev
enues to run the schools for a full
nine months' term and they are there
fore checking the matter up to the
voters.
As explained by Supt. Ramey at
the commencement exercises last
niglU, the board is asking for no
more money than was granted last
year. All of the funds derived from
the levy of an extra one mill last
year was not required and-it was stat
ed that the hoard, in the event the in
crease is authorized this year, will
use only as much- as may be needed.
Increase In the population of the
city and the consequent growth of tho
cfty and the consequent growth of
the. enrollment in the schools, it Is
r.tated, necessitates larger expendi
tures than can be met with the max
imum lev? allowed by law. The
building of the junior high school does
not enter into the board calculations
in regard to this matter, the levy that
is sought being necessary wholly for
maintenance.
