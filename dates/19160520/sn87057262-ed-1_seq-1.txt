PARIS, May 20.—The greatest
aerial activity on both sides was re
ported In today's official statement
from the war office, announcing un
eueoesaful German attacks on the
Belgian front and In the Champagne,
but no Infantry fighting at Verdun.
German aeroplanes bombarded the
French seaport town of Dunkirk and
the town of Bergues, south of Dun
kirk, killing six persons and wound
Ing thirty-eight. In reprisal, a
French air squadron attacked enemy
camps at Wyfwegeti, Zarren and
Handzaem and a Belgian squadron
bombarded the Ghlftelles aerodome,
many bombs reaching the mark.
Lieutenant Navarre, French air
hero, brought down his eleventh Ger
man aeroplane which fell behind the
Prenoh lines near Ghattanjourt,
northwest of Verdun. Both German
occupants were captured. This was
the second plane brought down by
Navarre In 24 hours.
Lieutenant Nungessen brought
down his fifth German plane which
fell In the Forges wood. Three other
German aeroplanes fell behind their
own Tines.
The attack on the Belgian front was
made by German groups which at
tempted to cross the Yser between
8teenstraete and Hetsas. The ad
vance was ohecked by Belgian In
fantry fire.
In the Champagne, the Germans
sent great gas clouds rolling down
upon the French lines In preparation
for an attack. The first German
troop* appearing behind the gas
clouds were met with such a hot fire
that no further attempt to advance
was made.
West of the Meuse the Germans
continued to bombard with great
violence the northwestern front of
Verdun, but there were no Infantry
actions.
LONDON, May 20.—German sea

Three German seaplanes took part
In the raid. Their bombs wrecked a
saloon and damaged several dwell

cording to the war office.
About thirty-seven bombs were
dropped. A soldier was killed and a

COURT ROOM, W
AUKEGAN, HI..
May 20.—A kind old judge who has
two daughters of his own and knows
how a woman acts when she is in
love stood out today as a barrier to
unfolding before a jury the heart
song of Celestia Youker, the girl who
loved Will Orpet, who is on trial for
the murder of Marian Lambert, his
will-o'-the-wisp sweetheart.
He is Judge Charles H. Donnelly,
presiding at Orpet's trial. Today he
declared that the sixty love letters,
written by Miss Youker to Orpet, will
not be read in the trial unless it is
absolutely necessary to establish the
state's case againBt the youth.
"I am averse to having the letters
read in court," said Judge Donnelly.
"They are love letters, full of senti
mAwt and endearment. The girl
pours out her heart In them and I
don't think «uch personal letters
should be read by any one but ths
youthful sweetheart to whom they
were addressed."
States Attorney Dady considers
some of the letters necessary evi
dence to establish what he believes
was the motive for Marian's murder
Orpet's love for Miss Youker and his
desire to be rid of her.
As Orpet sat In the court room to
day his face bore a new expression
of confidence that whatever may hap
pen, Miss Youker will stand by him.
Eighty-five of the last list of 100
veniremen were called for^the trial
when court opened today. Three ten
tatively accepted Jurors were In the
.box. Two hundred and seventy three
venirmen have been examined to date-
The court room filled early today,

VERDUN MUST FALL.
[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, May 20.—Germans regard
the fall of Verdun as one of the cer
tainties of this war. They have, how
ever, no extravagant ideas that the
taking of the French citadel will re
suit in the collapse of the allies.
Despite announcements from Paris
and London that the German offen
sive at Verdun has ended definitely
in defeat, the German lines continue
to draw more tightly about the fort
ress. No such rapid gains as in the
early days of the offensive have been
made, nor are they expected. But the
steady nibbling process Is slowly
wearing away the French defense
northwest of Verdun. It Is confident
ly believed here that the whole of
the French works centering about
Hill 304 and Dead Man's Hill will be
in German hands before long.
Exactly how many men are now en
gaged on each side at Verdun Is at
present a mystery. When I visited
the Verdun front seven weeks ago
the French strength was estimated at
about 350,000 by Argentine and Swiss
military observers with the crown
prince's army. The size of the Ger
man army could not be estimated, but
it was stated that it was perhaps two
or three times as large as the pro
posed new American standing army.
Everything is moving systematical
ly. There Is less excitement at the
front than In the cafe debeatlng so
cieties in Berlin where some' ardent
conversationalists can figure out Just
how Verdun's capture ^1H be the
turrtlng point of the war. They may
believe It, but they would be unable
to vaccinate that idea on the crowr.
prince's army who are doing the
fighting.
While well-informed Germans do
not believe that Verdun's fall will by
any means bring the end of the war,
they are convinced that such con
stant hammering at the French while
the Austrians are pushing their way
into Italy and the Brltsh and Rus
sians are being held firmly by the
Germans, is bringing them nearer a
final victory.
ATTACKS REPULSED.
BERLIN, May 20.—Repeated French
attacks against the newly conquered
German positions on the Haucourt
Esnes high road, northwest of Ver
dun, were repulsed, the war office an
nounced this afternoon. In the Ar
gonne, German patrol parties pene
trated French second line trenches,
taking some prisoners.
Letters From Orpet's Sweetheart
Will not be Read in Court
Orpet stood at his cell window for
an hour between 8:30 and 9:30 and
watched the country folk stream by.
He has a dislike for them because of
their inexorable stand on his guilt. He
has learned enough, however, not to
display his emotions before a packed
court room.
Orpet himself vehemently denied to
day that Celesta Youker called on
him at his cell. He labelled the story
a falsehood and was backed up by his
counsel and Sheriff Griffen.
"Not a woman except the boy's
mother has visited him in Jail since
the start." the sheriff said. "The
story was made of whole cloth."
Celestia Youker, "the little woman
In white," whose love for young Orpet
drove him to commit the crime in
Helms woods, according to the state,
will be forced to take the stand and
be numbered among the accusers of
the boy she openly adored. This was
made certain today when It was
learned that States Attorney Dady
had served the summons on her In
person less than a week ago.
Just what Miss Youker knows
about the tragedy is a mooted ques
tion. Prosecutor Dady calls her one
of his most important witnesses. Her
mother, on the other hand, declares
she knows nothing which will help
Either side. "Celestia knew nothing
about Marian Lambert," said Mrs.
Youker at her home In Maywood.
"She first heard the girl's name men
tioned two weeks after the finding of
the body. She did not even know
there was a rival for Will's affections
any place in the woild.
"She told States Attorney Dady
over and over again that she knew
nothing of Marian, but he seemed to
think she knew all about it. She will
never testify against WilL I think
she cares a great doa! for Will and
does not believe him guilty. She
knows Will did not drag her name

WILSON IN THE SOVTH
[By John H. Hearley, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
ROME, May 20.—Emulating the ex
ample of the German he)lr apparent,
the Austrian crown prlnoe has arrived
at Trent and Is directing the cam
paign against Vicenza, the Verdun of
the northern Italian front.
Field Marshal Conrad Von Holtzen
dorff, chief of the Austrian general
staff has joined the array of generals
on the Tyrolese front. It Is reported
here that General Cadorna, Italian
commander In chief, will move his
headquarters $ the Trentlno front.
Though last night's official state
ment from the Italian war office ad
mitted further retirements, there Is
every confidence here that the Austri
an offensive Is about to come to a
halt. Despite heavy sacrifices In men
and ammunition, the Austrians thus
far have crossed the Italian fron
tier at but one point—In the Astlco
valley. At no place do their lines
approach nearer than twenty-two
miles the important strateglo posi
tion of Vicenza, reported to be the
goal of the present offensive.
Between 200,000 and 250,000 Austri
an troops are engaged on the front
leading eastward from the Adlge
valley. It Is admitted that the losses
on both sides have been very heavy,
though no figures are available at the
present time.
There Is reason to believe the Aus
trians hoped to catch the Italians off
their guard, while Important Italian
troop movements were under way. Un

WASHINGTON, May 20.—A rumor
was in circulation here this afternoon
that Roumania is near a break with
the allies as the result of her recently
negotiated commercial treaties with
Germany and Austria. One report,
unconfirmed, said that the French
minister to Routf'anla had been re
called.
The information Is said to have
been contained in a private mesage
to a concern interested in Balkan af
fairs.
The German semi-official news
agency yesterday declared that the
Russian government had taken steps
to learn exactly what was contained
In the treaties negotiated by Rou
mania, suspecting that they were of
a political importance. The Berlin
agency safd the Russian foreign office
had authorized a statement to this
effect.
"Is Celestia still engaged to Orpet?"
she was asked.
Mrs. Youker refused to reply to this
question.
The work of selecting the second
panel of jurors went on until one
o'clock this afternoon, then Judge
Donnelly adjourned court..
"The reporters want to go to the
ball games," he said. The judge left
hurriedly for his home in Woodstock
to spend the Sabbath with his family.
Druggist Changes Mind Again.
MADISON, Wis., May 20.—Charles
W. Hassinger, former Madison drug
clerk admitted today that he did sell
William Orpet, former university stu
dent. charged with the murder of
Marian Lambert, Lake ForeBt, an
empty bottle a day or two before the
youth went to Lake Forest on the
fatal trip. Yesterday Hassinger de
nied selling Orpet the bottle.
"I did sell Orpet an empty bottle,"
said Hassinger. "But It was not a
two ounce bottle. It ivs.s a larger one.
I do not remember the size, but it
was larger. Of that 1 am sure."
"Why did you make a statement
that you sold Orpet a two ounce
bottle?" he was asked.
"Detectives took me oft my feet,"
he said. "They had me up in the
air."
"Did Orpet tell ou what he was
going to do with the tottle?" he was
queried.
I "No he didn't," he replied. "He did
not tell me anything about It."
Hassinger continued to maintain
that he did not remember the size of
the bottle whether it was a four
ounce receptacle or one holding a
pint.
The drug clerk also changed his
attitude regarding his appearance at
Wankeean as a witness at the trial.

PORTLAND, Ore., May 30.—Charles
E. Hughes of New York, Justice of
the supreme court of the United
States, was the overwhelming choice
of the republicans of Oregon as presi
dential nominee on the face of early
returns today from yesterday's state
wide presidential preference primary.
Scattering, incomplete returns from
twelve counties indicated that Hughes
had carried the state over Burton of
Ohio and Cummins of Iowa by a tre
mendous majority. These returns in
dicated that the New Yorker had re
ceived more votes than Burton and
Cummins combined.
Early figures gave Hughes 8.693:
Cummins, 2,890 Burton, 1,866. It was
estimated that sixty percent of the
total registration of 250,000 had been
cast at the primary. The count prom
ised to be very slow.
On the democratic side. President
Wilson had no opposition.
Cummins and Burton were active
candidates. Both did some campaign

asked the secretary of state to take
his name from the ballot, but tht

request and it remained, because the

Plan to Make Texas as Safe From Mexican

About It.
STATE HIIIM TO TAKE ACTIVE PART
Expedition Which Pursued Big Bend Bandits
Will Be Back at Home Within a
Few Days.
OOfLTOBBU®, N. M., May 20.—With
drawal of the Sixth cavalry from the
interior of Mexico, is part of the new
patrol plan decided on by the United
States, according to information here.
By this plan, heavy patrols to cover
the entire 2,200 miles of the Mexican
border are to be Inaugurated. This
will be the principal feature of the
new police policy.
Strong temporary military posts
will be fixed along the border as bases
for the patrols. From these points,
the soldiers will police thfe border, rid
ing in sufficiently strong columns to
repulse any attack and within sup
porting distance. These patrols will
be drawn from the state militia and
from regulars now on the border, re
inforced by such troops as are drawn
from the interior of Mexico. For that
purpose, according to Information
here, troops now in Mexico will be
gradually withdrawn.
A system of .truck trains, similar to
that in use from Columbus south into
Mexico, will be used to keep these
patrols in touch and to supply them
In case they are off the railroads.
It Is stated that General Funston
at San Antonio has already decided
on the stations of these patrols and
that trucks for their use will DO with
drawn from the Mexican route or
purchased if these are insufficient.
Two truck train captains have left
here for San Antonio to take up da
tails with Funston. Bids forelOO new
trucks have been asked. They will
cost $250,000.

SAJN ANTONIO, Te*as, May
Withdrawal of the second American
expedition from Mexico to Boqulllaa,
Texas, will be accomplished In a few
days. Colonel Sibley believes his
mission of dispersing the bandits
who raided Boqvlllas and Glenn
Springs has been accomplished and
he has notified headquarters of his
intention to return to the border.
For this reason, tie Sixth cavalry
which withdrew- from the first ex
pedition yesterday, will Ibe utilized as
a Big Bend patrol instead of reinforo
ilng the first expedition.
(Reports today showed that in the
recent "brash of the second expedition
with Mexicans, four bandr.s were
wound® ^1 and two captured.
They had held as prisoner a Car
ranza commander's son, thus showing
they wdre not allied with the Car
ranziutafl.
The second expedition has dispers
ed the bandits, driving them some
thing more than 126 miles below the
border. Further it has released
Deemer and Payne, the American
captives taken in the Big Bend raids.
This, taken with the fact that the
.Mexican country below the Big Bend
is arid at this time of year, leads to
the view that no considerable bandit
gangs can long carry on any opera
tions from there.

Democratic Platform.
WASHINGTON, May 20.—•President

platform that will be adopted art. the

are correct in their statements today.
He will receive suggestions from
democratic leaders, but It 1s taken for

presidents cabinet that he will be tha
real author.
On questions of foreign policy it 13
known the president will be aided by
Chairman Stone of the senate com
mittee on foreign relations, an ex
perienced platform builder. Stone's
Influence Is said to have been shown
in the recently adopted declaration of
Missouri democrats and the latter
document is believed to forecast to
considerable extent the national plat
form, so far as foreign affairs aru
concerned. The Missouri platform en
dorsed Wilson's foreign policies,
saying:
The United States has been kepi
out of war.
America's rights have been forceful"
ly championed.
A policy of non-intervention in
Mexico has succeeded while prompt
action followed raids across the bor
