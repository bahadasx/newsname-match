Some folk3 have very good, long
range memories and don't know it.
Old Si . says his memory is so poor
he can't remember a time when he
didn't have that tired feeling.
You imagine your lot in life is a
hard one but just think of a circus in
town and the children all old enough
to take themselves to see the elefunts.
If there were forty-seven days. and
nights jn every weekT even then there
would be a collision of dates on funct
ions. This sure is getting to be some
town on doin's.
o
To offer premiums in order to induce
people to take an interest in clean-up
days- or weeks is too- much like brib
ing people to perform a service for
themselves and is of very doubtful
utility. It gets indifferent results,
and worse yet it cultivates the
wrong spirit. We should, ' rather,
endeavor to create a spirit of personal
and civic pride. Renters, quite as
much as owners, should "clean up"
for their own sake, to say nothing of
public health and safety, and when
rubbish, etc., is disposed xof without
expense to the individual the public
has done all that the owner or occu
pant has a right to expect.
Oh certainly, the dandelion is a
beautiful flower, or would be if it
took hard wortc to grow the-m.
Twenty-five years ago the owner of a
dandelion bed in this tow n was con
sidered fortunate by people who
hadn't seen a dandelion for a "coon's
age." Then it was a thing to be
proud of, but it's different new. -.-
But the dandelion is hardly, the
worst ever.' The sandbur is quite as

which is mowed regularly all summer
will produce mature burrs on stems
not more': than two inches in length
late in the season almost after frost
has come; It ought to be a third or
fourth grade felony to allow this pest
to grow rank and ferocious along the
walks where the burrs catch in the
clothing of passers by and 'are thus
scattered and planted hither and
thither, to grow up and be a menace
to the public,'" whether barefoot or
shod or sockless. Make hay of them
before the burrs are pulled off or drop
off, and then burn the hay.
