These ships would be sold or leased
io private capital as rapidly as pos
sible, v.iih the government reserving
the right, to call them back into ser
vice as naval auxiliaries. The opera
tion of such vessels as the government
was unable to lease or sell would not
extend beyond five years after the
close of the European war.
A shipping board of five memhers,

maximum rates, would be created. The
bill now gos to the senate.
Plans for the democratic leaders to
pass the bill last night were frustrat
ed by Republican Leader Mann, who
conducted a filibuster against the
measure.
Night Effort Fails.
The democrats succeeded, however,
in restoring by a vote of 205 to 153 the
provision for the purchase of ships by
the government. It had been stricken
out in committee of the whole by a
vote of lot; to SO.
Immediately after the passage of
the shipping bill in the house today
the conference report on the army
bill was taken up. Chairman Hay of
the military committee, urged that it
be adopted, with all the increases
agreed upon by the conferees.
Mr. Hay told the house the bill was
not intended as an emergency meas
ure but simply a peace measure of
preparedness.
Mr. Hay assailed "ignorant newspa
per editors" for criticism of the bill.
By a vote of '.'AH to 25 the house to
iay adopir-d the conference report on
;he army bill as previously adopted by
Ihe senate.
Representative McKenzie of Illinois,
republican, supported the conference
report but Representative Gardner,
republican, insisted that the bill was
so shorn as to be acceptable even to
pacificists.
"For a nation as great as ours to
support an army no bigger than we
have today is as sensible as for Ty
Cobh io at'enjpl. to hit Walter John
son with a match instead of a bat," he
said.

to Battle at
Anylnvasion
Paris. May 20. Switzerland is pre
pared to contest with all the forces at
her command any invasion of her ter
ritory" by troops of the belligerents,
according to an interview with Presi
dent Camille De Coppet, sent to the
Journal by its Berne correspondent.
President De Coppet was asked spe
cifically what would be the action of
Switzerland if troops of one of the
warring powers should be sent across
the Porentruy salient. He replied:
"The federal council would never tol
erate such a proceeding and in accord
ance with the plans of General I'lrich
Wille, the commander in chief of our
army would order the immediate mob
ilization of all our forces which would
immediately be sent into action.
"The Swiss army is in splendid con
dition. It has reached a perfection of
training which has been hitherto un
known and has just received a com
plete equipment of new heavy artillery J
which was manufactured in France
and Germany by order of the Swios
government."
The Porentruy salient juts into
France immediately south of Alsa.ee.
The town of Porentruy is about 20
miles south of the great 'French for
tress of Belfort. If German troops
were able to cross the salient they
could strike at the communications of
the whole French line from Verdun to
Alsace.

WRIT IS GRANTED
IN MATTERS CASE
Judge Landis Issues Habeas Corpus
to Determine Legal Custody of
Child in Dispute.
Chicago, May 20. Margaret Ryan,
the little Canadian girl who says she
is the real mother of the infant which
Mrs. Anna Dollie Ledgerwood Matters
is seeking to prove her child, went be
fore Judge Landis in the federal court
today with a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus to obtain the child. A
forthwith hearing was ordered by the
judge.
Mrs. Matters, with Charles T. Mellon
and Harry Edwards is on trial in the
state court on a charge of conspiracy
to foist a spurious heir to the estate
of her late husband Fred Matters, up
on the probabte court.
Nuns and nurses from the Miseri
cordia hospital at Ottawa, Canada,
have testified that the child known as
Irene Matters was born to Margaret
Ilyan; who at the hospital was known
as Jessie Bryan.
Several of the witnesses in this Mat
ters trial admitted that before the
probate court they testified falsely that
the infant was the child of Mrs. Mat
ters. The state charges that a desire to
obtain a greater share of the Matters
estate led to the alleged deception re
garding the parentage of the child.
Hearing on the habeas corpus peti
tion was brief. The court issued the
writ and made it returnable next Fri
day with the understanding that it is
not to embarrass either the prosecu
tion or the defense.

Move Clocks
Up One Hour
to Save Time
London, May 20. The hands on all
clocks on British railroads, postoffices,
newspaper offices, police stations and
other places where business is conduct
ed throughout the night will be pushed
forward at 2 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing to 3 o'clock in accordance with the
daylight saving act. The general pub
lic will put their clocks and watches
one hour ahead before going to bed
tonight or will . awake to fina them
selves late for breakfast.
The new schedule will run until
Sept 30, when clocks will be stopped
for an hour. Factories, banks, stores,!
trains, theatres and restaurants will
all conform to the new time sched
ule. There is a small old fashioned
section of the people, who have derided
the daylight saving scheme but they
will be practically forced into line by
its acceptance in all public institu
tions. The only exception will be the parks
in the large cities which will open an
hour later to allow people the benefit
of more fresh air. The hour of 2 on
Sunday morning was selected for the
change because fewer trains are run
ning then than at any other time dur
ing the week.
Christiania, (via London,) May 20.
The legislature has passed the day
light savings bill, advancing the clock
one hour. The new regulation goes
into effect on May 22.
The passage of the daylight sav
ings bill by Norway makes the new

Europe. Germany adopted the new
schedule on May 1 and was followed
by England, France, Holland and the
Scandinavian countries.

WILSON HIT
REPUB STAR
DURING TAL
President Brands G. O. P.
Leaders as Men That Are
Looking Backward.
Charlotte, NT. C, May 20. President
Wilson today addressed a crowd esti
mated at more than 100,000 gathered
here for the 141st anniversary of the,
signing of the Mecklenburg Declaration i
of Independence. He was introduced!
by Governor Craig of North Carolina, j
who spoke of the president as one ot
the greatest leaders the nation has ever
seen.
The president spoke only briefly and
devoted himself almost wholly to dis
cussion of the ideals of the United
States. He declared "untainted Ameri
canism" was needed and that the
United States must preserve its ideals
in order to be of assistance in helping
the world. He was enthusiastically
applauded. Among other things he
said:
"I want to call your attention to the
fact that this nation has devoted itself
almost too much to material things.
There have been other nations just as
rich as the United States. We must
think of what we are going to do with
our wealth and our prosperity.
"America did not come out of the
south and it did not come out of New
England. It came out of the middle
states where there was a mixture of
different races."
"Europe is fighting out in war the
questions we are fighting out in peace,"
said the president. "In America wc
have tried to set the example of peace
by keeping together. Isn't it the sign
and dawn of a new age that the one
thing new on which the world is about
to fall back is the moral judgment of
mankind?"
With the hope that the United States
after the European war would be able
to lift up a symbol of the "still, small
voice ot humanity" the president
closed his address amid a burst of ap
plause. Salisbury. N. C, May 20. President

' can party as men who are "looking
i backward."
Members of the president's party de
clared he was referring to the fight
led by Senator Gallinger defeating the
nomination of George Kublee to the
federal trade commission. The presi
dent said:
"I do not believe they represent the
great rank and file of the republican
party, but the men who now control
the republican party are looking back
ward. They do not know the problem
of the new day and whenever I, for
example, try to show my sympathies
for the forward looking men of their
own party for nominating men of that
sort, they at once try to block the pro
gress. They have no sympathy with
the forward-looking men of their own
party.
"Now I am for forward looking men,
not for backward looking men. We
have come down here to celebrate an
historical episode but we have not
done so because we are looking back
ward; we have done it merely in
order to give ourselves the excuse to
get together and feel the thrill of be

volcanic smoke and steam burst from
the Mauna Loa, on the island of Ha

way to Mauna Loa by automobile to
investigate the reports of flowing lava.

FOUR ACCEPTED
FOR ORPET JURY
Third of 'umber of Jurors Meeded
are Sworn in After Week Spent
in Examining Veniremen.
Waukegan, 111., May 20. The first
panel of four jurors of the 12 men
who will try Will H. Orpet, the col
lege boy accused of murdering his for
mer sweetheart, Marian Lambert, was
sworn in today after a week spent in
examination of veniremen.
The four who have met the approv
al of counsel for the state and the de
fense are: Len Bartell, iceman, ot
Antioch: G. A. Thompson, farmer ot
Newport: H. F. King, farmer of Area
and G. V. Willoughby, farmer ol
Waukegan.
Several special venires have been
exhausted in the attempt to till th
jury box and many prospective jurora
otherwise acceptable have been dis
missed because they said they "had
formed an opinion in the case."
Most of the veniremen have beeu
summoned from parts of the county
distant from Lake Forest where the
body of the school girl was found last
February in the snow in a patch of
woodland not far from her home.
Chemical analysis showed that
quick acting poison was the death
agent and the state's theory of the
case outlined by tho state's attorney
was that the poison was given to the
girl by Orpet who had tired of her. or
that she was led by him to take it In
the guise of a medicine to relieve a
condition brought about by their as
sociation. DAY IN CONGRESS
