PUTTING IN PLATFORMS?
"Funny Planks/ Answers Expert
Charles Edward Russell, noted editor and political authority, will tell
Tnucs readers just how the.platforms stand at present. Today he tells what
the republican! are doing. Monday he'll write of the democratic situation.
You'll be on the road to a thorough knowledge of the nation's lf)K> poli
ties after reading this remarkable series by a man who knows. Here's the
first one:
By Charles Edward Russell
CHICAGO, May 20. —Those crisp and pithy
humorists, the gentlemen who every four years
frame up for us our national political platforms,
are now hard at work upon a seasonable output
of their handicraft for the campaign close at
hand.
It has been my privilege in the last few days
to lie much In company with gome of these gift
ed artists and I can assure the. public that this
year's offerings will be of unusual excellence,
and If anybody but their makers ever read po
litical platforms, would once more prove our
country's supremacy in comic literature.
This is true and without discrimination as to
all of the parties. Begin with the republican
pint fin iv, for instance.
I am told by those best fitted to know that
it will contain much fine new dope and win
praise from all connoisseurs. How reasonable
this is will bo seen from the following outline
of the points now practically agreed upon.
DEMOCRATIC INCOMPETENCE! This
will bo the big tiling and painted in con
vincing colors. Democratic mismanagement
lias brought ruin to the country nnd the
blush of shame to the cheek of every true
American. Never have the affairs of the
nation and the Interests of the people been
ho grossly manhandled. In every depart
ment of the government and every branch
of Its activities is to be seen nothing but
i'liiios, confusion, calamity and convulsions.
This Ib the good strong play and is depend
"cd upon to snatch them baldhe.ded.
THE TARIFF! This old friend, whose bil
lowy whiskers the wind has lifted go many
years, will have a new application as illustrat
ing the blighting effects of democratic incompe
tency.
Thus, tbe depraved and stupid democratic
tariff, abandoning the ancient prinoiple of pro
tection that made this country great, hag brought
upon our country huge disaster. It hag ruined
enterprise, stopped the wheels of industry and
filled our streets with honegt labor deiirived of
its livelihood and cruelly thrust Into poverty.
From this black nbyae. Industry was but tempor
arily and partly lifted by the accident of the
European war, but when that is over the worst

catastrophe In our history will fall upon ug, to
be dispelled only by a restoration of the repub
lican party lo power und a return to its principle
of protection to American industry.
THK FARMERS! These will be shown that
the low prices of their cro|ig are the result of
the democratic tariff, which lias so impoverished
the uatlou that no one can buy anything, and
at the same time has put farm products on the
free list with assafetida and aluni. This assures
tho agricultural vote, or would if agriculturists
ever read It.
DEMOCRATIC EXTRAVAGANCE! This will
be roaated to a black aud sickening cinder.
Also, WAR TAXES! We may as well
have the druggists on our side.
COST OF I.IVI NO! This will be used as an
opportunity to throw in a good hot taunt be
cause the democrats have not reduced it as they
said they would- taunts being always a strong
play.
FOREIGN POLICY! The democratic ad
ministration in tliis respect will be covered
with blister-. It has boon weak, timid and
flabby about asserting American rights and
protecting American citizens. Republicans
from strong Column districts are lying
awake, nights about this, but the most they
can get is v promise that Mexico will be fea
tured, and that may take the curse off—a
little.
PREPAREDNESS! To the limit, the demo
crats being seared for neglecting the nation's de
fense.
Child labor will lie denounced, but not in a
way to cause unnecessary pain. There will be a
ringing declaration in favor of an American
merchant marine. Conservation, being a double
ended petard, will be handled with discretion.
About one thing the authorities disagree. A
strong effort will be made to get in a plank de
nouncing the LaFollette seaman's act and de
manding its Immediate repeal. Borne of the
leaders object; saying what is the use of kick
ing labor in the face when we are none too
strong anyway? But others say that can be
fixed up with planks about workingmen's 10m
pengatlon end Immigration.
Home gentlemen want to roast the demo
crat's for falling to keep their platform
pledges, but this is denounced as unpiofes
| alonal. __^________

The pulillo service commis
sion's hearing on the Pi.Ket Sound
Navigation Co.'s proposed in
creased tariff will be concluded
May 26.
Until the decision is given on
whether the rate is justified the
company's boats will be allowed
to run on the new tariff.
O. O. Calderhead, rate expert
of the public service commission,
declared today that the conimis-
Blon had decided not to prevent
the Incrense from going Into ef
fect on the date specified by the
company when ihe tariff was
filed, In order to save inconveni
ence all around.
If the Increase is knocked out
by the commission, he said, the
company will have had only six
days of grace.
if, on the other hand, the in
crease is upheld, a new tariff
would have to be filed, naming a
new date in case the increase
liiml not gone into effect today.
One of the big points at
issue before the commission
appeal's to be the claim of
the roiiip.-ui> that it needs to
equip and keep up four boats
for the i'miuna-Seattle- run
—the Tacoma, Indianapolis,
Hyer nnd Chippewa.
It Is up to the commission to
decide whether the Puget Bound
Navigation Co. should get a fair
return on two boats of four
bouts.
The increase today effects chil
dren between ,"> and 12 years of
age. as well as the grownups.
Half fares .jumped from 20 to tl
cents a single trip and from 30

"Yes, and those palls will be
filled to verflowlng," the presi
dent responded.
At Oreeneboro the president
si>oke again, saying:
"We are at the beginning of a
new age. We must be sure not
to give countenance to men who
