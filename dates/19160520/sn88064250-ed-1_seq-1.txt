THOUSANDS WITNESS
PLEANANT TAKE OATH
INAUGURATION OF NEW YOUIS IANA CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS PRO
NOUNCED THE MOST SUC CESSFUL IN THE HIS
TORY OF THE STATE
Baton Rouge, La., May 15.
Thirteen thousand widly enthusi
astic Louisians made the historic
courthouse grounds ring with con
tinuous and tremendous applause
today, when Ruffin G. Pleasant of
Shreveport, sworn in as chief ex
ecutive of the state, thrilled the
admiring multitude with a single
act which touched off every pentup
emotion that- surged through the
hearts of the men and women gath
ered here to see the inauguration.
It was a touch of human interest
which set the throng afire and
brought handkerchiefs into action
on the ladies' side of the inaugural
stand, when the stalwart son of the
hills upon whom the great state of
Louisiana has bestowed its great
est honor took Mrs. Pleasant into
his arms and kissed he2 within full
view of the audience.
Sworn in by C'hief Justice Monroe
at exactly 12:17, and having read
his inaugural address, the governor
was shaking hands with ex-Govern
or Hall and T. Sambola Jones when
Mrs. Pleasant slipped through the
crowd to her husband's side. In a
moment the new executive was lost
to the commotion all around him.
Taking the new first lady of the
state in his arms, the governor
kissed her affectionately. Mrs.
Pleasant sat on the platform with
her aged mother, Mrs. S. P. Ector
of Shreveport, and with Mrs. Luther
E. Hall. Surrounding them were
Mrs. Pleasant's lady escorts from
New Orleans and many other parts
of Louisiana.
Ex-Governor Hall and Chairman
Jones sat together on the platform
immediately behind him, anid un
der the beautiful bower of cut
flowers and bunting from which the
inaugural address was delivered
sat Democratic National Commit
teeman Robert Ewing, L. E. Thom
as of; Caddo; Associate Justice
O'Neill, Mayor Behrman of New Or
leans; Associate Justices Provosty
and Land, Lieutenant Governor
Mouton, ex-Lieutenant Governor
Barret, Atterney General Coco,
Secretary of State Bailey, Treas
urer Hunsicker, Mayor. Grouchy of
Baton Rouge, Superintendent of
Education T. H. Harris and others.
The platform built undeir the his
toric oaks which sheltered Foster,
McEnery and Nicholls, was .built to
accommodate 200, but its capacity
wa-' taxed long before the ceremony
began. Over the speaker's stand
and shading the stand from the hot
rays of the sun was a great flag of
the state. The day was ideal. The
crowd tie largest that has ever at
tended an inaugural in Louisiana.
The visitors are placed conserva
tively at 13,000.
Rev. Battle opened the ceremo
nies with. invocation. Ex-Governor
Hall stood with the chief executive
as he administered the oath.
Father Drossaerts delivered the
benediction.
MRS. ARTHUR L. HOLLIER
DIES AFTER SHORT ILLNESS
Well Known Lady . Expires from
An Attack of Pneumonia
Funeral Largely Attended
Mrs. Arthur L. Hollier, nee Mary
Evelyna Bailey, aged 48 years, 5
months and 2 days, died at the
family residence on East Grolee
Street, on Thursday afternoon at
5:30 o'clock, after an illness of sev
eral days; death was caused by
pneumonia.
Mrs. Hollier was well known
throughout the surrounding coun
try and enjoyed a very large num
ber of friends. Her death, though
expected for the last few days,
came as a severe shock to her
many friends and relatives.
Funeral services took place from
the home on Grolee Street to the
Catholic Church; interment was
made in the Catholic cemetery at
4:30 Friday evening. The Knights
of Columbus, of which the de
ceased's husband is a member,
attended the funeral in a body. A
large number of friends and rela
tives attended the funeral.
Mrs. Hollier is survived by her
husband and three children.
The Clarion extends its sympa
thies to the family in their hour of
grief.
Armand Sylvestre, constable-elect
from Plaisance, and Eraste Dupre,
of Ville Platte, were transacting
business here on Monday.
eai.. ~n ~
During the delivery of the inau
gural address and the administer
ing of the oath of office which pre
ceded, movie operators and many
camera men clicked their machines.
After photographing the governor's
section, most of them turned down
their batteries on Mrs. Pleasant,
who sat behind a big bouquet of
lilies.
It was 1 o'clock when Governor
Pleasant finished his address. His
conclusion was the signal for an
other ovation from the crowd and
his friends on the platform to
come forward to grasp his hand.
Colonel Jones again took the
helm after the cheering had sub
sided, and introduced C. F. Tru
deau of the state department of
education, who tendered Governor
Pleasant a silver inkstand as token
of esteem from his former class
mates of Louisiana State Univer
sity. Mr. Trudeau, in happily
chosen language, wished Governor
Pleasant success and offered con
gratulations, and not failing to re
mind 'him of the time when the
class had nominated him governor
in their under graduate days, a
prophecy that now was being ful
filled.
Governor Pleasant was presented
by Charles McVea who was general
chairman of the inaugural commit
tee, with a floral emblem made of
sweet peas and ferns, and bearing
the words, "Welcome Home."
Upon leaving the state house,
Governor Pleasant, Mrs. Pleasant,
Mrs. W. M. Barrow and a few others
of their intimate friends, went to
the executive mansion, which had
been prepared for them by Mrs.
Hall, and which was formally turn
ed over to theme From the exe
cutive mansion they went to the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Barrow,
where they stopped for lunchepn.
Governor Pleasant's first scratch
of the executive pen made John
Marshall of Lake Charles, private
secretary-to the governor. Marshall
served as campaign- manager for
Colonel Pleasant, and his appoint
ment waslong forecasted. He took
charge at once, his predecessor in
office, Paul Sompayrac, having
taken an early train for New Or
leans.
Judge A. V. Coco was made at
toreny general of Louisiana by the
second scratch of the pen. Although
elected to the office, Judge Coco is
not eligible to office until May 18,
under the constitution. Inasmuch
as Governor Pleasant vacated the
office today, and interregum of
three days was created, which
made it necessary for the appoint
ment, Judge Coco announces he
will continue the office as at pres
ent until his formal induction un
der the constitution. His son, A. V.
Coco, Jr, recently. appointed assist
ant attorney general to succeed the
late Mr. Gondran, took office at the
same time, practically, as his
father.

The Opelousas school is aboilt to
close one of the most successful
sessions in the history of the in
stitution, despite the fact that it
was forced to change head in the
middle of the session, on account
of the election 'r Professor Pres

made a splendid principal in the
opinion of those who are in a po

PARISH BElINS WYORK
OF TICK ERADICATION
Money Is Secured for Ercetion of
Dipping Vats Throughout Parish
SEVERAL VATS IN COURSE
OF CONSTRUCTION ALREADY
Cattle Owners Will Be Given An
Opportunity of Ridding Their
Stock of Dreaded Tick
The campaign against cattle tick,
which was precipitated in the po
lice jury several months t
ago, througo a motion of W. F.
Brown, from the fourth ward, and
which was finally pressed until
money was available for the erec
tion of dipping vats, has been
started in earnest. Already there 1
are several vats in different por
tions of the parish under construc
tion, according to W. M. Babin, par
ish farm demonst tor, who has
been assisting the police jurors
along this line.
St. Landry will put up three vats c
in each of the six wvards; in many
localities public spirited citizens f
have signified their intention of l
putting up as many vats,as the par
ish; these vats will be opened to
the public. Altogether it is expect
ed that within the next year there
will be upwards of fifty dipping E
vats at the commands of the stock
owners of St. Landry -
With proper preca tion St. Lan
dry should be placed Rithin the fret
tick territory within lthe next year
or two. It is figured by expert cat
tle men that stock vill be worth
from $5 to $10 more ter head after
the Federal quarantine will be lifted
off St. Landry than attpresent.
At this rate it is soid that St.
Landry will make a isplendid in- f
vestment in the erection of the dip- x
ping vats. I:
It is not believed that a compul- c
sory dipping law will 'be passed by
the police jury'within the next few
months; it is the consensus of opin
ion among the police jurors that a
compulsory law would play havoc
with the cattle owners, as a num
ber, who would dip their cattleun
der ordinary conditions, will not
do so, if forced to. If after one
year, -however, it is seen that a
compulsory law is needed, it is
very probable that such a move will
be made.

RAILROADS CANNOT. MEET
DEMANDS OF EMPLOYEES C
t
"Basic" Eight Hour Day Would Play t
Havoc With Railroads
of Southwest
Regarding the statement of the I
transportation brotherhoods that I
the "Basic" Eight Hour Day will I
benefit the shippers by more fre- 1
quent service in compelling the
railroads to shorten their trains
for increased speed, says a promi
nent railroad official:
Let us assume that 3,000 tons are
to be moved and that this tonnage
is now moved in three trains. Un
der the proposed "Eight Hour Day"
basis it is to be moved in four
trains. Increasing the number of
trains from three to four would
not only increase direct train ex
pense in great proportion but
unless number of tracksand sidings
were increased the tendency to.
congestion would slow up move- 1
ment of all trains.
Practically all of the trains of I
the Southwest are single track and
aside from the expense, the diffi
culty of handling four trains is
much greater than three trains.
All railroad men have realized the
need for increasing train loads and,
with this in view, heavier motive i
power, heavier rails and stronger 1
bridges have been constantly pro
vided.
If the railroads return to the
light tonnage basis, the enormous 1
sums invested in betterments of
this character would be wasted. 1
Reference to the following table 1
clearly indicates how the increase
in the capacity of trains has been 1
necessary to meet constant reduc- I
tions in rates, increases in the pay
of employes and material and bet
terments of service.
1890 1914
The average number of
tons per train in the
United States was...i75.12 451.8
The average revenues
of the railways per ton
mile was.. 0.941 of i 0.733 of Ic
Does it not appear to you -that,
after all, the brotherhoods are
making this argument solely to in
orease the number~of employees?

LARGE OIL CONCERN
MAY BORE NEAR HERE
RUMORED THAT DRILLING ON SPLANE AND BENNETT PLACES
WILL BE STARTED IN SHORT WHILE BY A
$5,000,000 OKLA HOMA COMPANY
If what is rumored on the streets
of Opelousas is true then a large
Oklahoma oil company, capitalized
at $5,000,000 will begin boring on
the Splane and Bennett places, a
short distance form Opelousas.
There- has been so many rumors
of late years (t' oil companies pros
pecting for the valuable fluid, but
as yet no one has been able to suc
ceed in striking oil. It is very
probable, however, in the opinion of
many St. Landrians, that a company
with sufficient capital would finally
strike oil.
It is claimed with certainty by
some tfiat the Oklahoma oil com
pany is in earnest and that they
have sufficient reasons to believe
that oil in paying quantities exists
on the. Bennett and Splahe places,
and as a matter of fact may be
found anywhere in that neighbor
hood.
Naturally if oil would be brought
in so close to Opelousas this city
would prosper as rapidly as
Sreveport; it would not be many
years before Opelousas would be

The local Billies have been pre

here under the auspices of the Elks
on the night of May 26th.
The public is promised a real
corking good time; in fact the Elks
promise not to "humbug" the peo
ple out of their money, they are
positive that there will not be a
single attendant who will be sorry
after the show. for the money spent
for theientrance fee.
The actors in the Humbug Circus
will be Opelousas Elks; as the local
order of Billies is already composed
of a large number of natural
clowns, it'is expected that a jolly
time will be the order of the day at
the circus.
The Humbug Circus' big street
parade will go through the princi
pal streets of the city, from the
tents near the Haas Garage and will
be of widespread interest; it will
start promptly at 6 o'clock.
DUPRE IS APPOINTED
JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN
St. Landry Representative Has Been
Selected Head of Very Ida
poortant Committee
Judge Gilbert L. Dupre has been
appointed chairman of Judiciary
"C" one of the most important
committees of the House of Repre
sentatives .
Some of tIX most influential and
best known members of the Lower
House were applicants for the
three judiciary chairmanships but
1 Powell of Beauregard, Brynes of
New Orleans and Dupre of St. Lan
dry were the lucky applicants.
Judge Dupre is fully competent
of holding down this 'important
job; besides'he was one of the orig
inal Pleasant supporters, waging an
unceasing political warfare against
the enemies of Ruflin G. Pleasant.
The new chairman of Judiciary
"C" had some of the most promi
nent men of the state supporting
t his candidacy, although Judge
Dupre, in his characteristic man
ner, did not even open his mouth to
She Speaker o~f the House, in an at
tempt to secure the favor; he
thought that he was entitled to it,
Sand therefore if the Speaker wanted
to honor him he would appreciate
it, but would not "plead for it."

While it is claimed that no local
people are interested in the Okla

able that there is Opelousas money
in the proposed project.
Gas pressure has been found to
exist on the Splane -place for a
number of years; in fact the owner
of the place, Mr. Ben Splane, at
tempted at one time to get some one
interested in the proposition with
him, so as to ascertain whether or
not oil really existed there.
It is believed that one day St.
Landry will bring in the largest
producing oil field in Louisiana;
people who claim to know some
thing about the hidden fluid are
confident that oil wells will be as
numerous in this parish as in old
Caddo. It will take thousands of '
dollars, 'however, to eventually find
the oil, but it is thought that a
company of $5,000,000 capital would r
have no difficulty in bringing in oil t
wells, since they would have suffi- t
cient money to bore numerous
wells. t

BILL PROPOSE1S TO GIVE

Senator Barousse. of Acadia, has

which, if passed, will give the old

It is very probable that there
will be no diffieulty in making the
bill law, as the money can be raised
without additionally taxing the
people of Louisiana; a constitution
