He Considers His Duty Consists in Dis
cerning and Executing the Desires
of the
To the unthinking, it probably appears as if all that is neces
sary to be president of the United States is to sit in the presiden
tial chair and draw the slight moiety which the American people
give to the man whom they elect to control their destiny. It may
appear to be an "easy job" to these people but it is not as they
would soon discover were they to be given that place of high
honor, but of many ti-oubles especially in. the past two years.
The lot of President Wilson, who has so ably steered the ship
of state during the past two troublesome years, has been far from
a happy one for it has been fraught with national dangers such
as which no president has been beset not even the great Wash
ington and the immortal Lincoln and he has successfully weath
ered all the perils and steered the ship ably and safely through a
sea of trouble that would have caused any other man except
Woodrow Wilson to have long ago stepped aside and turned the
helm over to some one whose mind was less exacting and whose
sincere and patriotic Americanism was less pronounced.
But he did not and due to this the United States is now en
joying the blessings of peace and the greatest prosperity in the
nation's history.
President Wilson is not given to egotism or to hornblowing
he leaves that for Teddy and his ilk but on Tuesday night when
he appeared at a gathering of the National Press club in Wash
ington he could not refrain from speaking of some of the many
difficulties of the three years in which he had been president, and
particularly of the motives which have guided his handling of the
European situation. His address was at length and from what
he said note these personal impressions
"If I cannot maintain my moral in
fluence over a man except by knocking
him down, then for the sake of his
"toul I have got occasionally to knock
him down."
"The people of the United States
are not asking anybody's leave to do
their own thinking, and are not ask
ing anybody to tip them off as to
what they ought to think. They are
thinking for themselves."
"J am put here (as president) to
interpret, to register, to suggest, and
more than that and much greater than
that, to be suggested to."

sions to become disengaged by what

o the Church of Our Savior, in Kose
Jindale, "led her into the garden of
bden, then forsook her," .Miss Laura
Louise Johnson oi .Minneapolis brought
a $20,000 breach of promise suit in the
federal court today.
The courtroom was crowded with
spectators, many women among them.
The suit arose out of an alleged pro

Johnson was a student at the Univer
sity of Vermont.
DILLINGHAM FOR STATE
SENATOR
Henry Dillingham, one of the
best known Democrats of Platte
county and a man who has a
statewide reputation, will no
doubt be a candidate for senator
from the Third district. He is
one of the most popular men
in this part of the state and
would have but little troublo in
curing the nomination, which
r"is equivalent to an election. The
Liberty Tribune says:
"There Is talk now of Platte
I county having an entry In the
' senatorial race In the Third dls-
trict, of which 'Clay county is a
part, Jn the person of Henry
Dillingham of Platte City.
Henry's territory is not confined
to Platte county, but reaches
over into Clay county."

EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY
When Once Secured Speaker
Champ Clark Says It Renders
Members Invaluable
On March 1C the National
Press club held a reception and
banquet in Washington and
among those who addressed the
assemblage was our own Champ
Clark, the greatest living Mis-
sourian, of whom not only all
Missourians, but the nation is
proud.
In view of the fact that the
present year will witness another
election of congressmen from
this state, it Is pertinent to quote
what Speaker Clark had to say
on that occasion in reference to
the retaining of members who
had acquired the experience and
acquaintance without which a
man, no matter how talented or
gifted he might be, can accom
plish what is needed for bis con
stituents. It is a fact only too
well substantiated that the East
always secures any legislation it
desires, and it accomplishes it
through the medium of keeping
senators and congressmen who
have acquired the training and
experience on the Job; while the
West, which is constantly chang
ing public servants of that class,
has a hard time to get anything
at all.
Here is what Speaker Clark
said and how he feels about the
matter:
"No man should be elected to
the House simply to gratify his
ambition. All members should
be elected for the gpod of the
country.
"The best rule, It seems to me,
is for a district to select a man
young enough to learn and to
grow, with at least fair capacity,
industrious, honest, energetic,
sober, and courageous, and k'eep
him here so long as he dis
charges his duties faithfully and
well. Such a man will gradually
rise to high position and in
fluence In the House. His wide
acquaintance with members helps
him amazingly in doing things
"I can speak freely on this
subject without violating the
proprieties, for my constituents
have kept me here 22 years, and
for 20 years have given me nom
inations without opposition, for
all of which favors I thank them
from the bottom of my heart,
Their generous action and un
wavering friendship have enabled
me to devote all my time to the
public service. I have not been
compelled to spend any portion
or my time in "mending my
fences.' My constituents have at
tended to that. God bless them!'
BLEW UP POSTOFFICE
A Can of St. Joseph Yeast Causes "a
Panic in the Greenfield,
Ohio, Office
St. Joseph yeast has a reputation
not only for rising but for exploding
and causing Uncle Sam's minions to
sit up and take notice. An innocent-
looking can which was sent from this
city by Orvllla Leigh, according to the
Greenfield (Ohio) Enquirer, caused all
sorts of excitement there. The En
quirer tells the story after this fash
ion: On Sunday morning Wilbur McWll
Hams and Harley Ellis were busy as
sorting the night's mail. Having just
read in the Enquirer of recent Ger
man dynamite plots to blow up the
government works, they suspiciously
eyed every package in the parcel post
and handled It as gingerly as if it
were labeled "eggs." Suddenly there
was a loud report, papers were blown
In every direction, and the room was
filled with acid fumes that had a sug
gestively chemical smell.
When the two startled clerks
crawled out from beneath the assort
ing table and began to survey the
surrounding, they found that many of
the scattered papers and. packages
were smeared with a peculiar sticky
substance that gave forth a' pungent
but not disagreeable odor. Harley
thought it must be the deadly cordite
UBed by the French in their 32 centi
meter bombs, while Wilbur insisted it
was the liquid from which the Ger
mans produced the stifling gases em
ployed in their trench attacks.
Just at this Juncture Joo Walker
came in and sniffing the air for a min
ute, exclaimed, "Who busted that can
of yeast?" A further examination of
the wreckage disclosed a tin can with
the lid blown off, and the scattered
contents was readily identified as the
best quality of home-made yeast. The
parcel post brings many queer pack
ages into the post office, but the next
can of yeast, that .comes along the
boys will probably obey the directions
to "keep in a cool place."

Record of Insults
"His reference was to Mexico. Very
well turn to the Tribune index for
laot, under '.Mexico We find the
entry, July TI, 'Two Americans Shot.'
In the year iao5, the record for Jan
,uary 18 is '1. A. Sanger Murdered,'
and for January 2'.'. 'Vaquls Kill your
Americans.' But the telltale year is
1900. The 'insults' to our flag were
piled thick. Here are some of the en
tries: 'American Klshlng Boats
Seized;' 'American fishermen Jailed;'
'American Sailors Charge Tortures.'
It was In June, 1900, that occurred
the crowning 'imtamy' as Koosevelt
would have called it if lt had taken
place under Wilson. Kead this: 'How
Americans Died at Cananea.' And
then, oh, shame-faced Americans, read
this: 'Root Denies American Troops
to Cananea!'
Vain Plea for Aid
"There had been a murderous out
break at the Cananea mines. Several
Americans were killed. What did the
imperilled American survivors do?
They snt to Washington, througnthe

The greatest game at present in

with Woodrow Wilson In the race on
the Democratic ticket, is about equal
to the chance of the proverbial snow

place.
But that is not the local part of the
story. That part comes through the
fact that one of St. Joseph's best

eastern concern and employs a large
number of men in this territory to
look after its business, this week re
ceived a letter from Secretary Blrrell
