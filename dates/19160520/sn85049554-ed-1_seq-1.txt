Measure Supported By Ad

Vote ot 211 to 161.
PROVIDES FOR
SHIP PURCHASES
Bill Carries Appropriation of $5,000,000
For Charter or Lease, of Vessels—
Ships .Would Be Sold or^ Leased to
Private Capital, With Right Reserved
to Call Them Back to Government
Service in Case of War.
Washington,. IMay 20.—The adminis
tration shipping bill passed the house
today py a vote of 211 to 1S1, virtually
in the form it was Introduced.
The bill now goes to the senate. It
proposes to appropriate $50,000,000 to
be raised by Panama bonds for the
purchase, charter or lease of ships by
the government. The ships would bfc
sold or leased to private capital a3
rapidly as possible .with the govern
ment reserving the right to call them
back into service as naval auxiliaries.
The operation of such vessels as the
government was unable to lease or sell
would jnot extend beyond five years af
ter the close of the European war.
Filibuster Abandoned.
A shipping board of five members
empowered fo prevent rate discrimina
tion and unfair practices by all ships
plying American waters and fixed
maximum rates would be created.
Republicans, who yesterday delayed
the vote by offering more than ten
amendments made no further attempt
to amend the measure. Democratic
Leader Kitchln and others who op
posed the bill last year were won to Its
support by the clause limiting govern
ment operations of ships to five years
after the close of the war.
Income Tax Returns Heavy.
Returns from the Income tax for the
coming fiscal year are estimated at ap
proximately $120,000,000 in revised fig
ures- belng^ compiled by the treasury
department. The exact amount within
a few-"thousand dollars probably will
be known within" the fiext few' days'.
The" expected return of 120,00^,000 lis
*35,000,000 ,or over 40 per cenK more
than officials estimated when congress
convened.
Individuals are expected to pay ap
proximately" $62,500,000 and corpora
tons $57,500,000.
The $120,000,000 estmates include
omissions of previous years.
House Passes Army Bill...
By a vote of 349 to 25, the house to
day .adopted th^ conference report on,
the army bill as previously adopted by
the senate.
Immediately after the passage of the
shipping bill the conference report on
the army bill was taken up. Chairman
Hay, of the military .-committee, urged
its adoption.
Mr. Hay assailed "Ignorant news
paper editors" for criticism of the bill.
Representative Coady, of Maryland,
asked Mr. Hay if there was any truth
in the published report that a provi
sion had been put in the bill for the
specific purpose of providing a place
for Judge A. C. Carson, of the supreme
court of the Philippine islands, and a
native of Virginia, as civilian judge ad
vocate in the army, and asked if^Judge
Carson was not the only person who
could qualify for that office under the
bill.
"Yes," retorted Mr. Hay. "If that will
give you any satisfactlftn."
Representative Gardner, republican,
insisted that the bill was so shorn as
to acceptable even to pacifists.
"For a nation as great as ours, to
support an army no bigger than we
have today is as sensible as for Ty
Cobb to attempt to hit Walter John
son with a match instead of a bat," he
said.
^WILSON AT CHARLOTTE.

cussion of the Ideals of the United

icanism was needed" and that the!
United States must preserve its ideals
in order to be'of assistance In helping
the world.
"I have come back for a brief visit
to a region dear to my heart," said
the president. "I do not know wheth
er I can interpret for you the spirit of
this occasion. It is necessary to
realize just what we celebrate. There
were only 3,000,000 people In this na
tion when it became independent now
there are 100,000.000 people. There
have beejk changes, but we have the
same elements. What I want to Im-"
press $n you is that we have always
been In th« making. Among the men
who founded thla-mation there was a
Vjpry great passion for human liberty.
"There have been other nations Jdst
as .rich as the .United States. e'must
