Verdun Effort Down.

British Are Pressing Turks
In Egypt In Small
Skirmishes.
London, May 19. The Italians in
southern Tyrol are now holding back
the Austrians from further inroads
into their positions. In the Ledro
valley southwest of Trent and in tho
Lagarina valley of the south of the
city, the Austrians, after heavy ar
tillery preparations, threw vicious at
tacks against the Italian lines, but all
of them were repulsed with heavy
casualties, according to Rome.
Five attacks were made on Zegna
torta, the same number as were made
Wednesday and again all of them
were stopped with sanguinary losses.
In the Adamello zone to the west of
Trent, where previous gains have
been made by the Italians; they have
occupied additional territory in the
Sarcaba river region and in the Mon-
falcome region, near the head of the
gulf of Triest, have recaptured trench
es taken from them by the Austrians
last Monday.
Another ineffectual attempt has
been made by the Germans against
the r rench positions in the Avocourt
wood an don Hill 304, to the north
west of Verdun. Paris reports that a
strong attack was put down by the
French guns and that the Germans
appeared to, have suffered serious
losses.
On the remainder of the front in
France and Belgium, aside from an
unsuccessful infantry attack against
the Belgians north of Steenstraete,
there have been only bombardments-
The British in Egypt have carried
out a successful maneuver against the
Turks and tribesmen at Bayod and
Magei, putting them to flight and de
stroying the camp at Bayod.
Austrian airoplanes have dropped
bombs on Avalona, Albania, the only
seaport on the eastern Adriatric re
maining in the hands of the entente
allies. That Avlona probably is well
fortified against an infantry attack
is indicated by the statement of the
ustro-Hungarian admiralty that the
raiding aircruft were heavily shelled.
