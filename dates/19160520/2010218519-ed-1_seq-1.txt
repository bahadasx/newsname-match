B The President's
B Opportunity
THERE lived in Cali
fornia in the fifties
a flrey, eccentric, reck
lessly brave, and quick
to quarrel, but kind
hearted old chap nam
ed Colonel Gift. He had
a great stock ranch and
his blood horses were
many of them famous
racers. They were his
love and at every state
fair he and they were
among the most sought
for attractions. He was
growing old but if he
realized that fact he
never admitted it.
At one state fair,
early one morning two
young men engaged in
i fist fight. A rush was
(jiade to separate them,
when over the clamor
the stentorian voice of
Colonel Gift was heard
crying: "Let 'em fight;
it will do them good."
Later, the same day,
the colonel was having
his horses paraded and
was calling attention to
their special excellence,
when a chap, who did
not know the colonel
or his ways, made
what the colonel deem
ed a sneering remark
B at which the colonel
B made a rush for him
B and struck him. The
B astonished man seized
,vM the colonel by the
fcj arms and crushed him
B to the ground without
B hurting him, and held
B him there.
B Of course there was
B a rush to rescue the
B coloned when a neigh-
B kr wll knew him and
B loved him, but who
B had been present at the
B morning episode, shout-
B ed "Let the young men
Jm fight! Let 'em fight! It
Sjp will do them good."
B The colonel cried
B out: "Do not mind that
H d d fool; take him
PI off!"

0110188011 CHRISTENSEN is a native of Utah. His parents were Hiram J. Christensen
and Anne Paulson Christensen and he was born at Manti, March 28, 18G9.
Though scarcely at the meridian of his intellectual powers, by his work Professor
Christensen has already given especial honor to the title of "native son." His first real
schooling was in a Presbyterian school in this state.
He gained a diploma in the Utah state normal school and later the degree of Bachelor of Arts
from the Utah university.
He married Miss Katie Dean, who had also graduated from the state normal school.
He was superintendent of the Utah county schools from 1893 to 1897. Then he traveled extensive
ly in Europe, visiting schools and equipping himself with the methods of instruction In the most fa
mous educational institutions there. A special permit from the royal minister of education of the
kingdbm of Prussia was his "open sesame" to all schools.
Irf'i'898 and 1899 he attended the great Goettingen university in Germany and followed that by
courses in the Harvard and Yale summer schools.
Nftw for sixteen years he has ber-n at the head of the public schools of Salt Lake City.
No one can estimate the value oi the work of Professor Christensen to the youth of this city.

tained a plank intended ! H
to prevent a president H
from immediately run- H
ning for a second term. B
But it has been made H
clear on many occa- 'H
sions by his' words and H
acts that the president H
has never endorsed H
that limitation, but H
lather that the thought H
that ruled him was H
Let the young men H
fight! It will do 'em B
good!" Vjfl
He does not know it, B
but the thought of the B
German and English ', H
votes has been behind I H
his c o r r e s p ondence H
with those countries, it B
has been behind what H
he has said on many H
public occasions which jB

that they are just now M
