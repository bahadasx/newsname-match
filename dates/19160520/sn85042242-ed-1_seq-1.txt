URGES TRUE AMERICANISM
AND PREPAREDNESS
Former President Greeted En-
thusiasticly at American
Honor Day Affair.
Detroit, Mich., May ID.—Theodore
ltoosevelt urged thorough military
preparedness for the nited States and
pleaded for true Americanism in two
addresses here today before the con­
vention of the Brotherhood of Rail­
way Trainmen and shook hands with
several thousand persons at a public
reception at a down town hotel, short­
ly before departing for iNew York
this evening.
The former president,,was greeted
enthusiastically everywhere during
his stay here as honor guest of Am­
erican Day celebration. An unusual
demonstration occurred while he was
delivering his forenoon address,
when an elderly wofaan, interrupting
his expressions of approval of univer­
sal military service, cried out: "1
have two sons who 1 offer."
"If every mother would make the
same offer," the speaker replied,
"t^ere would be no need for any
mother to send her sons to the front."
I have been very reluctant to make
speeches during these weeks imme­
diacy preceding the National Nomi­
nating Conventions, because it is very
difficult to make people understand
that 'speeches at such a time are not
of the ordinary political type made in
the interest of some particular indi­
vidual's candidacy. But I finally de­
termined that 1 would come here to
Michigan to say certain things which
I believe should be said at this time.
What I have to say to you will not
be in the interest of any man, and
least of all, of myself. It will not
refer to the candidacy of any., ^di­
vidual It will iadnfc refer to thtf policy
of,any party, save as such party pol­
icy may, and ought to, vitally concern
ihe welfare of the nation. My speech
will be devoted exclusively to certain
great principles which should be
fundamental in this giant-democratic
commonwealth of burs. Wherever I
toii'^ on 'in individual, it will be be
caufe£r T,
cannot make my meaning
cleaiVVa^e by speaking of individuals
who embody or typify certain move­
ments.
Mention of Henry Ford.
1 come here to Michigan because
in the primary for the selection of
delegates to the Republican National
Convention, Mr. Ford was victorious,
and following on his victory here, he
showed a marked popular strength in
Nebraska «|Dd Pennsylvania. The ef­
fect of thife showing has been imme­
diately visible upon many of the poli­
ticians within and without Congress.
One of the leading anti-preparedness,
or peace-at-any-price papers in New
York recently commented with great
satisfaction upon the defeat in the
lower house of Congress, of the pro­
posal to increase our regular army to
250,000 men. This paper stated that
originally the proposal was defeated
by only i22 votes, but when the vote
came up again ten days ago, it was
defeated by 79 votes. It continues
(I condense) 'Of these 221 negative
votes, 51 were cast by Republicans,
49 being from the Central West, what
has come to be known as the Henry
Ford Territory. These included 6 of
the 11 from Michigan—a notable
change since it was proposed in the
House. Since then Mr. Ford's large
votes in Michigan and Nebraska have
been recorded. All three Republican
congressmen from Nebraska were op­
posed. If this is not a pretty clear
indication as to prevailing anti-mili
tarist temper in the Middle West, what
can be? It is as well refreshing proof
that there will be strong forces in
both party conventions to throw their
influence against the militarist planks
of Mr. Roosevelt."
This situation makes it advisable
to speak with courtesy but with entire
frankness of what the success of Mr.
Ford means, and is taken to mean,
and of the forces that have given Mr.
Ford his strength. It is in Michigan,
Mr. Ford's own State, where the Ford
movement began, that I wish to say
what I have to say on the subject.
Worthy of Commendation.
For Mr. Ford personally, I feel not
merely friendliness, but in many re­
spects a very genuine admiration.
There is much in the methods and
very much in the purposes, with which
he has conducted his business, not­
ably in his relations to his working
people, that commands my hearty
sympathy and respect. Moreover,
there is always something attractive
to an American in the career of a
man who has raised himself from the
industrial ranks, until he is one of
the captains of industry. But all that
I have thus said, can with truth be
said of many, perhaps of most of the
Tories of the Revolutionary War anfl
of many or most of the pacifists of
the Civil War, the extremists among
-whom were popularly known as Cop­
per Heads. Many of these Tories and

THIRTY-SIXTH TEAS, NO. 121 (MEWS OF THE WORLD)'
Temporary
Roster of
Delegates
Washington, May W.—Secretary
James B. Reynolds of the republican
national committee began preparing
the temporary roll of delegates to the
party's national convention.
Delegates from all but three states
have been chosen. May 23, Texas
will select its delegation by the con­
vention system, and South Dakota
will elect its delegates by direct pri­
mary.
June 6 West Virginia will elect its
delegation by direct primary, but
there will be only one set of names
voted for, as the leaders have agreed
to thresh out their factional disputes
in a series of pre-primary conven­
tions.
Northern Baptists Dispose of
Another Important
Question.
COMMISSION TO ACT
AS COURT OF EQUITY
Minneapolis, May 19—The north­
ern Baptist Convention today dispos­
ed of another of the several important
questions facing the present meeting
by empowering a commission to sit
as court of equity for the adjudica^
tion of ail differences between afliliat
cd societies, and thus bring about a
more effective co-operation between
Baptist organizations in the Unitd
States.
This same commission, which will
consist of eleven members yet to be
appointed, will work out the details
of the plan lor consolidations of the
missionary work of the. American
Baptist ^Publication Society and the
Amelican Honfe Missions Society1.
Settlement of tnis question ended a
controversy which extended over
nearly a score of years.
The convention's action today was
construed by many leading Baptists
as a movement which ultimately will
devolve .into a union of the Northern
Baptis't fc0nvention and the Southern
Baptist convention.
Intimations that Baptists of the
west might withdraw and form a sep­
arate conference because of what
was characterized as the "long dom
ination by the East," preceded the
selection of Cleveland, Ohio, as the
meeting place next year by the com­
mittee named to select a city. Vigor­
ous protest was made when it appear­
ed likely that Atlantic City N. J.,
would be selected.

IS NOT YET'
Realignment Being Delayed by
Slow Mobilization of
National Guards.
MANY COMPANIES BELOW
THEIR PROPER STRENGTH
General Funston Has Not as Yet
Made a Complete
Report.
Washington, May 19.—'General Fun
ston's realignment of the border pa­
trol is being delayed, war department
officials said today, by slow mobiliza­
tion of the Arizona and New Mexico
national guard and by the disappoint­
ing showing in numbers and equip­
ment of some of the companies report­
ing for service. Although it has been
ten days since President Wilson call­
ed out the Texas, Arizona and New
Mexico guardsmen for patrol duty
along the border, their mobilization
and assignment is far from com­
plete.
In addition, so many companies iii
all three states have been found to
be below their proper strength that
the war department now expects the
total guardsmen provided will not be
more than 3,000 and probably a few
hundred less. When the call was is­
sued it was depended on to add 3,500
men to the border patrol.
So far, Gen. Funston has reported
only in a general way on the national
guard mobilization, but a fuller re
port is expected early next week.
Official hope that by that time the
reassignment of troops, along the bor
iler will have become completed.
1,000 Men WiU Be Added.
Hy the first of the coming week al­
most 1,000 men will be added to the
border patrol in the Big Bend district,
where bandits raided L'oquilles and
•Glenn Springs two weeks ago. Gen
Funston has given orders for the 6th
Cavalry, commanded by Joseph A.
Gaston, that arrived today at Colum­
bus, Njf M., from 'service With Gen.
Pershing's coftifinHs ti6modi
utely at Marfu, Texas.
Col. Sibley is expected to teach the
border near iBoquilles on Monday, and
soon after Major Langhorne is ex­
pected to arrive with his two troops
of the 8th Cavalry, bringing to an
end the little expeditionary movement
begun Jifter the raid on Glenn Springs.
Brigadier General iHenry A. Greene
left here tonight for the border, and
early in the coming week it is expect
ed the militia will be ready to take
Its assignment in the Brownsville
district. Out of the 4,000 guardsmen
who reported for service in this state
failed to respond to the call to take
the oath of allegiance in the regular
establishments. The number rejected
for physical disability was negligi
ble.
Order Countermanded.
The order of withdrawal sent tt
the Sibley-Langhorne expeditionary
columns two days ago has been Coun­
termanded and the American troops
which invaded Mexico in search ot
Ihe Glenn Springs bandits frill re
main there indefinitely, it is report.eC
here tonight. This column will prob
ably be reinforced by troops from
Gen. Pershing's columns. Major
Langhorne, when last heard from,
had established his camp at El Pino,
125 miles south of the border.

Sensational Turn in Second
Bragdon Vice Trial at
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis, Minn., May 19.—An af
fidavit charging jury tampering in
the interests of the defense in the
second trial of Joseph W. Bragdon, a
wealthy business man, indicted in
the recent vice investigations on
charges brought by several young
girls, was filed in district court to­
day. Judge Daniel 'Fish immediately
ordered the jury into the custody of
a bailiff until the end of the trial.
The affidavit was made by a worn
an, who charged that a mother of
one of the girl witnesses talked to a
juror and then reported to women
who were with her: "He's a Brag­
don man now. The case is clear."
The affidavit may be the basis of
criminal proceedings, the state prose
cutor announced.
After testifying regarding the al
leged "fixing" of witnesses in the in­
terest of the defense, prior to the
first trial, Mrs. Madge Hollands faint­
ed in the court room today.

WAR UBY IS
CENTER OF PLOT
TO
Canadian Girl Real Mother of
Famous Matters
child.
HER LOVER WAS
CALLED TO COLORS
Witness Broke Down When Ask*
ed if She Wanted Her
Offspring Back.
Chicago, May 9—The "spurious
heir" in the case -ojr Mrs. Dollie Led
gerwood Matters, [charged with con­
spiracy in altera pimg to foist a baby
on the probate court according to tes­
timony today was a real "war baby."
The testimony came from a swqet
faced little Canadian sir], Jessie Bry­
an, mother of the child.
Jessie went to work in a Canadian
factory when she Was l'J yearse old.
For three years, alio "kept company"
in innocent fashion with a young
shoemaker. They were to be mar­
ried. Then came t1\e great war, and
tho shoemaker donned his uniform
to go. f'"
A year or so ar^o, much writ­
ten and spoken ',»f the great wave
of emotion Which shook women of
belligerent countries as their men
walked away to possible death. The
elemental instinct brushed aside the
traditions and conventions of centur­
ies and "war babies" became a prob­
lem.
Lover Sailed Away
It was thus with Jessie Bryan. Her
lover sailed away wrth his comrades
and some months .later, the girl went
to the Misericorda Hospital at Ot­
tawa.
Not a juror took his eyes from the
frank, round face of the girl, as she
told her story. Tears dimmed her eyes
although they did not overflow, and
luer lips quivered. Her voice was
bravo but tremulous. It was not un­
til she was asked,-"'do you want, your
baby now?*' that
sUj
brt)ke t'own and
wtrdfd not jpfifii&ilr aTisVer -the
question.
Sent to Public Ward
"It was in May 1915, that my moth
er took me to the hospital," said the
witness. "It cost her $25.00, and I
was sent to the public ward where
they sent all the poor people."
It was to this hospital that Mrs.
Matters, according to the testimony,
came seeking an infant that she
might cast off on the probate court
as the posthumous child of her late
husband, of whose $300,000 estate
she desired a larger share.
"We called her the millionaire
lady," said the witness. "She had a
private room.''
The infant, a girl, was born July 24,
1915. But the unwell mother was told
that she was born dead. The girl
continued her story:
All the Luxuries
"I was taken into a private room,
here was another woman there—mar­
ried— and she asked me a lot of
questions. said I did not want to
stay there. I wanted to go back to
the poor ward, but the nurse said no.
They brought me chicken on silver
trays, anu nice things I had never
eaten before in my life."
"August 3, there were several ba­
bies to be christened, and one was
brought in to me. It was the most
beautiful baby, dressed in beautiful
clothes, and 1 asked whose it was.
The nurse said, 'isn't it pretty it's
the millionaire lady's." I felt the lace
and soft embroidery."
Four months passed before Jessie
learned that the baby she admired so
much was alleged to be her own.
"A chum," continued the witness,
"read of the Matters case. She told
me about it and I ran out of the
house straight to the hospital. All
the old Nuns had gone. I begged for
the truth, but no one could tell me."
"You want it now, don't you?" put
in Attorney Ramsey, of the prosecu
tion, but Mr. Burrows objected, and
a burst of sobs was the only reply
the jury sot.
Mrs. Matters' late husband was an
old man, engaged in banking and
moving picture business.

Urged to
Register
Every voter in the city of Bismarck
is urged to register at once, if they
have not already done so, to enable
them to vote at the primary election,
June 28. Voters of the capital city
must be registered by Assessor Au­
gust Peterson, and if they have not
already taken care of this important
matter they can do so by calling at
the office of D. T. Owens on Fourth
street, where the assessor has his
headquarters.
The assessor's books must be in
by the 1st of June, so in order to
make things easier for all concerned,
those who have been negligent in this
matter are urged to attend to it im­
mediately. 'f'Vt

London, May 19—Under the heavy
pounding of the Austrian artillery,
Italian forces have been forced to
withdraw from portions of their lines
in the region of Trent, which have
been bombarded for three days. An
official communication from Rome
admits tho evacuation of the Zegna
torta position in the Lab'arina Valley,
and the Upper Astico from Monte

The Italians, however, have occu
pied further Austrian positions in the
Adamello zone, capturing prisoners,
material and provisions.
The artillery struggle continues
more violent on the Avoucourt Wood,
Hill 304 and Lemort llomme. This
artillery fire is not so great on the

TO
SAVEJL FIELDS
Bill Now in Congress Will Open
California Oil Fields to
Land Entry
Washington, May 19.—Secretary
Daniels appealed to President Wilson
today to use his influence to save the
navy's reserve in the California oil
fields as a vital step in the campaign
for adequate national defense.
Should the bill favorably reported
by the senatt? publiq 'lands committee
to legalize certain entries on lands
withdrawn by former President. Taft
in 1909 become a law, Mr. Wilson
was told, the navy must abandon oil
fuel and return to coal with a subse­
quent loss in steaming radius and
speed to its ships. Navy designers
have advised the secretary that it
would be unsafe to continue the con­
struction of oil burning battle craft
unless an adequate supply of fuel was
in sight.
'Mr. Daniels submitted a full sum­

dent began studying the problem im­
mediately, as the bill probably will
be taken up next week in the sen­

Mann demanded teller votes on many

regards the principles of Socialism
as more import ant than the fteshpots.
In other words, he is not a political

Everyone must recoguifce that there
is an honest demand on the part of
the farmers for closer economic and
political union. The spirit of co-oper­
ation is sweeping the country. How
unfortunate thai, at this time, when
the sentiment \had been carefully
worked up by the Equity, The Grange
and the Farmers' Union, that a bunch
of carpetbaggers should exploit an
honest desire for reform.
There has seldom been in the his­

attempt to gold brick the farmers.
Townley, Bowen, Coates, Martin, and
others, failing to float their schemes
under the banners of the state Social­

as Non-partisans not in any fight for
principles, but merely to get ,the

HIGH OFFICIALS ARE
IN CONTROVERSIES
New York, May 19.—Disclosures,
developments and charges followed in
rapid succession today in the Thomp­
son legislative committee's inquiry
into the wire tapping activities of
the 'New York police. After hours
of verbal exchanges between Sena­
tor George F. Thompson, chairman
of the committee, and municipal offi­
cers, Police Commissioner Arthur A.
Woods was permitted to take the
stand to attempt to justify the wire
tapping practice.
Earlier in the day, when the con­
troversy between Mayor Mitchell and
Senator Thompson had reached an
acute stage, the mayor accused the
senator of "cumulative treachery" to
the United States because the com­
mittee chairman insisted on going on
with his inquiry after Mr. iMitchell
had protested that to do so might in­
volve the federal government in'grave
international complications, associat­
ed by the mayor with munitions con­
tracts. Senator Thompson asserted
that the United States was in no way
involved. He was supported in his
contention by District Attorney
Swann. This phase was complicat­
ed tonight, when United States At­
torney H. Snowden Marshall issued
a statement declaring: "Any publi­
cation of the facts in the case at this
time would be most regretable from
the standpoint of the administration
of federal justice. I have made in­
quiry into the circumstances concern­
ing the investigation now going on,
into the listening on the wire of Sey­
mour & Seymour," Mr. Marshall said,
"and find that the case which the po­
lice department referred to as having
to do with the federal authorities is
a case I know about which has been
of interest for some time to the fed­
eral authorities, and which involves
national issues."
Mr. Woods in his testimony failed
to make any disclosures regarding an

for very personal and foolish ends,
and large numbers of ill-grounded,

to ollow, dazzled by the short cut
ound by those Moseses to lead them
out the wilderness. The writer has
had ample opportunity to study the
discovery and growth of the latest
short cut so blatantly announced by
Townley and 'his gang, having been
for several years a member of the
state executive commute and fre
quently forced to fight this sanm gang
while within the party. So much has
been said about the leaders of the
Non-partisan league being Socialists
and the Socialist party of North Da­
kota endorsing them that I am com­
pelled to touch upon some phases of
Socialism that would seem unneces­
sary, in order to clear the Socialist
movement of the infamy of appearing
to support this gang of renegades and
crooks who have done all in their f'
power to wreck the Socialist party
in 'North Dakota, when they foun#
they could no longer use it for their
