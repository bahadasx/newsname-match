State Aid for Good Road Building.
We publish an extract from
Act 49 of 1910 in regard to good
roads, which ought to be of in
terest to our readers, as follows:
6582. [Sec. 6]. All work of
construction, improvements and
maintenance of highways, under
the provision and direction of the
State Board of Engineers, shall
be performed by the State High
way Engineer in accordance with
the plans, specifications and con
tract prepared and executed
therefor.
6583. [Sec. 7]. The total cost
of all work of highway construc
tion, improvements and mainte
nance under the provisions of
this act, shall be paid by the
State treasurer upon the warrant
of the State Highway Engineer
approved by the president of the
Board of State Engineers, out of
the fund hereafter created for
the purpose of this act. The
parish,- city, town or village
wherein such work of improve
ment has been or is being per
formed, shall refund to the State
one-ffalf of such total cost there- 4
of. The portion of said cost to
be borne by the parish, city,
town or village, in which said
highway improvement has been 4
made, shall be paid to the State
treasurer by the treasurer of I
said parish tpon the order of
said police jury, or by the treas- c
urer of said city, town or village
upon the order of the mayor and
council or other governing body.
e completion of any such s
contract ighway improve
ment, the State ay Engi
neer shall certify to te "State
treasurer and to the president of
the police jury of the parish, or i
the mayor or other governing au- I
thori:y of the city, town or vil- I
lage, wherein such work or im
provement has been performed,
the portion of the cost thereof to
be borne by said parish or par
ishes, cities, towns or villages, or
either or any of them sh'all not
be paid to the State treasurer
within thirty days after being so
certified by the State Highway
Engineer, then the portion of
such parish, city, town or village
remaining unpaid shall be charg
ed to said parish, city, town or
village, and no further State aid
for highway improvement shall
be granted said parish, city,
town or village until the amount
due is fully paid, with legal in
terest from maturity, into the
hands of the State treasurer to
the credit of the State Highway
Fund hereinafter created.
Provided, that not more than
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)
shall be used or apportioned by
the State Board of Engineers to
the building of such highways in
any one parish during any one
calendar year, if other parishes
have pending application for
State aid in highway construe
tion under the terms of this act;
and providedl further that no par
ish shall receive an apportion-i
ment or expenditure of said
funds for more than one year
when other parishes are applying
for said funds.
A section of this law states
that a parish may be divided into
good road districts, and infers I
that State aid may be obtained
for road building in such dis
tricts, which disproves the idea
that State aid can only be pro
cured by voting a parish wide
road district.
Are You Bothered With Consatpatiom?
You wil have grateful relief from the
first dose of Po-D)o-Lax. It is a com
pound laxative for it not only empties
the bowels but stimulates the bile and
other secretions. It attacks constipa
, tion at its source an. you get perma
nent relief. Po-Do-Lax will give you
regular stool and only occasionally will
you need it. An excellent liver medi
cine. 50c at druggists.--Adv..S.
He Can, but Won't.
n Any gentleman can swear, get
d drunk, tell stories that would
lower him in the estimation of
his mother and wife, and go
f where he would . be ashamed to
d be seen by the girl he loves- but
r he won't.
e Any gentleman can drive a
Il sharp bargain; he can take ad
[- vantage of the other man's ne
h cessities, he can drive him into
Ã½- a corner, he can rub his hands
d gleefully and say to himself as
he sees him writhe, "business is
,t business," but he won't.
Any gentleman can kick a dog,
abuse a horse, misuse a child,
f laugh at another man's mistakes
e and devilishly gloat over another
t man's failures-but he won't.
r Any gentleman can grow cyni
e cal, sour and pessimistic, he can
f feel that everybody is against
r him and he against the world, he
e can scoff at all good things, ridi
e cule your religion and damn your
judgment-but he won't'
Any gentleman can say harsh,
e sarcastic and cruel things, he can
- crush' flowers and fertilize weeds,
D he can stab you with words-but
he won't.
I Any gentleman can make this
i old world, this topsy-turvy, this
e greatly misunderstood, this fini
f ties not-to-be-understood world,
f a far better place because he
- chanced to pass along this way
e and he will.
A Symbol of Health.
The Pythagorians of Ancient Greece
1 ate simple food, practiced temperance
- and purity. As a badge they used the
five pointed star which. they regarded
as a symbol of health. A red five point
ed star appears on each package of
Chamberlain's Tablets, and still fulfils
r its ancient mission as a symbol of
health. If you are troubled with indi
gestion, biliousness or constipation,
get a package of these tablets from
your druggist. You will be surprised
at the quick relief which they afford.

UGH! OALOMEL MAKES YOU SICK.
DON'T STAY BILIOUS, CONSTIPATOED
"kis's Lhr Tol" WIU Cla TYr
u1ggisih LiU hlw Thni Chali
and Can Nho Sab.
Calomel makes you sick; yo lose a
day's work. Calomel is quiqcsilver and
it salivates; calomel injures your liver.
If you are bilious; feel lazy, sluggish
and all knocked otft, if your bowels are
constipated and your head aches or
stomach is sour, just take a spoonful of
harmless )oson a's Liver Tone instead
of using sickening, salivating calomel.
I)dson's Liver Tone is real liver medl
ine. You'll know it next morning be
wse you will wake up feeling fine,
our liver will be working, your head
iehe and dizaisnes gone, your stomach
will be sweet and bowels regular. You
will feel like working. You'll be cheer
ful; full of energy, vigor and ambition.
A Card to Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines
We are anxious to see that all lines owned by
other parties and connected with us are'kept in such
condition as to furnish efficient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are responsible for their upkeep,
we want to co-operate with them.
All lines require a thorough overeauling oc c.
sionally if the best service is to be obtained. We
recommend that every line connected with us be
overhauled at least once a year, apd that at least one
experienced telephone man assist in this work. The
cost of this work when divided among all the patrons
of the line, makes the amount paid by each man
small, and this cost will be more than offiet by the
i improved service.
If the owners of rural telephone lines in this sec
- tion are experiencing trouble with their service, we
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fully. We will gladly do
- what we can toward helping you improve the con
dition of your line.
