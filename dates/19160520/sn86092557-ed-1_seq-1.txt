bo much interesting information about
the fruit and farm lauds of Florida
until he asKud Mr. McCrory about the

J from the sturboaru side the reporter j
I "a"lB this Mr. McCrory?" The mil

? Watson hotel.

" to take the more rooms which will be

I. "Why?a couplo ot yeara ago that
J 'space was undeveloped (pointing to
w tne strip of laud bctwen Lake Okecho

built 14 miles of railroad and intend

National C. of C. Announces
Result of Recent Ref
erendum.
MANY VOTES WERE CAST
All Four Propositions On
the Educational Refer
endum Approved.
(Special Dispatch West Virginian)
WASHINGTON. May 20. ?An
nouncement lias been made at- the
offices of the Chamber of Commerce
of the United States of the result of
the referendum on the question of
whether there should be federal leg
islation permitting the maintenance
or resale prices "on identified mer
chandise for voluntary purchase, made
and sold under ccmpeiitive conditions"
and the additional proposition,
should the legislation take tho form
of an amendment to the trade com
mission act defining the conditions
under which price cutting is an un
fair method of competition and au
thorizing the Federal Trade commis
sion to prevent such price cutting
in interstate and foreign commerce?"
Three hundred and fifty-four organ!*
nations, located in 41 states, the
trict of Columbia. Alaska, Hawaii and
r ranee, affiliated with the national or
ganization filed ballots on these two
questions and the total number of bal
lots on the first proposition was 930.
Of this number 093 favored it and
237 were opposed. This commits the
National chamber to the first proposi
tion by a large margin.
The proponents of the second prop
osition were not so fortunate, for al
though it was given a'two to one vote
it failod by a small margin to get thd
required two-thirds. The vote was 594
for and 289 against. It is clear from
the .result of this referendum that
the. business* men of the country are
heartily in favor o'f some form of con
trol of resale prices.
The result of the vote on Referen
dum No. 14 commits the National
body to all four of its propositions.
This is the educational referendum
and the character of the vote is re
garded as highly significant of tho
state of mind of thinking element oC
the population of the country.
The vote on this amendment in de
tail is:
Proposition No. 1?The committee
recommends liberal federal appropria
tions for vocational oducation. In fa
vor, 831; opposed, 110.
Proposition No. 2?Tho committeo
recommends that- the appropriations
be alloted among the states upon a
uniform basis and bear a uniform
relation to appropriations made by
the states for liko purposes. In fa
vor. 828; opposed, 95.
Proposition No. 3?Tiie committee
recommends tho creation of a Federal
board to be representative of tho in
terests vitally concerned and to be
compensated sufficiently to command'
great ability. In favor, 788; opposod,
144.
Proposition No. 4? The committee
recommends that the Federal board
be required to appoint advisory com
mittees of five members each, repre
senting industry, commerce, labor,
agriculture, homemaking and general
or vocational education. In favor,
784; opposed, 137.
Negroes Fined For
Fight in Street
After the evening session In Mayor

said that a rumpus had started in the
