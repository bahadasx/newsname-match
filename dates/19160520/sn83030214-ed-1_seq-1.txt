I.ondon, May l!<. Aga _ tbe Italians
have been forced to give way under the
terrr- c battflriflga of the Austrian ar?
tillery and the massed Bflaanlta on the
Irentrno frontier. Rome admits the
evacuation 0f the Zegnatorta position,
south of Trent, and al?o the ||Ba he

Astico.
Vienna elaims in addition the crosi

To the prisoners and guns th,ir.n Vl...
terday 900 more men, with twelve ofl.
cers ,,rid eighteen esnnon and muchiri..
guns, have been addrd.
Ob.servers here, while making due al
L.uarrce for tbe Austrian gains, declare
their inportanee has been greatly ex

man failure at Verdun, they asscrt,
Austria has gravely weakened her (_a
lician front, hterally scrapinj; to?
gether regiments with whieh to begin
an offensive against Italj.
The Central Powers count it as of
ertreme importance to hold thc initia
tive this spring. They hope thus to
po.atpone any Allied drive on the west
front or in the Balkans until fall or
even until next year. In the mean time
they are using every means in their
power to effect peace, through neutrals
if possible, through themselves if nec
f'sary.
Austrians' Gfllflfl Kiaggerated.
In considering the Austrian BSCCeBflfla
in the direction of Asiago, it ia n *ces
sary to remember that at this point
thc Austrian frontier has not been
forced by the Italians. The pre.-ence
of thc formidable fort of I.usernr.
whose heavy guns ean reach e'? I
the Italian village of Asiago, has pre
vented this.
