ty siat, wo aro suro to accomplish
much toward tho building of passable
highways, roads that will bo a plea

tho object of tho captain "over each
squad to build just a llttlo better
piece of road than his neighbor.
The problem now before tho com
mltteo In charge Is to know just how
to handle all tho teams which have
been promised for the day. Shale
will bo hauled from the canyon and
put on tho road where most needed
between tho Dessret Mills and the
mouth of tho canyon. It is possible
that somo work will bo dono whoro
needed on tho canyon road above
tho State dam In the canyon. At any
rate, It Is up to every loyal booster
of Logon and Cacho Valley to Join
In this slate wide movement for bet
ter roadp and do their llttlo part
along with tho others to mako o
showing worth while.

IMPROVEMENTS

Tho following editorial was taken
from yesterday's Ogden Examiner:
"Cacho county people nro making
elaborate arrangements for bringing
about permanent Improvements which
will contribute to furnish develop
ment of tho rural sections and bring
tho richly producing lands closer to
tho prolltnblo markets. Next Wed
nesday thoso backing tho movement
estimate 25,000 men will bo at work
Improving the puUlc highways. Tbl
will bo a practical celebration of
Good Roads day that will bo of tho
great benefit to tho northern purt
of tho state.
Tho enterprise thus demonstrated
clearly outlines tho progressive spirit
j which will forco Cacho county to tho
I ront. Tho people responsible for the
movement are tho kind who will bo
vnlunblo In a broader Hold of co
operation and that fact Justifies tho
plans of tho Ogdon mombors of tht
Utah Manufacturer's Association to
cultivate closer business rotations
with these neighbors to tho north.

TRIUMPH IS
SCORED BY
MISS GATES
Pres8 Clipping, Philadelphia Record,
February 14, 1916, On Her
Eastern Tour
To say that Miss Gates scored n
triumph would be putting It mildly.
Tho 4000 music lovers who packed
tho big auditorium simply went mad
over her. Hor voice is strong and
clear and sweet, with n remarkable
range and a surcness that speaks
well for her training. It Is a voice
of moro than ordinary grand opera
callbro. Hundreds In tho audience
who are regular attendants nt tho
Metropolitan opera performances
said she was easily superior to half
tho regular leading sopranos. It
was stated that bIio had refused two
offers to go into grand opera, prefer
ring to remain on tho concert stage.
Slio sang only two songs, refusing
to encore, although called out again
nnd ngnln by prolonged npplauso.
Her first selection wns the Bell Song
from Lnkme, a most difficult aria,
the prelude to which has to bo sung
without tho orchestra. Throughout
this song, tho singer must Imitate
the notes of a bell, without singing
any words. The manner In which
Miss Gales accomplished this was
truly extraordinary.
Not only wero the music lovers In
tho nudlcnco enthralled, but n squad
of reserve policemen, who wero on
duty In tho opera house, adjourned
after tho song to the basement where
they discussed the singer and music
with fervor nnd appreciation.
Her second song was, Cora Nome,
from Rlgolette, and aria In which Tet
lazzlul is supreme, nnd sho approach
ed tho Tetrazzlnl mark so closely
that tho nudlcnco went wild.

POSTMASTER
TAKES SHOT AT
, MRDAINES
We nro In receipt of n communica
tion from Hon J. M. Illalr of Lo
gan City la which he tnkes lssuo
with n recent statement In this pa
rer wherein tho county administra
tion, tho postmaster, and some of the
county olllclals wore "touched up.'1
As a real nifty example of genuine
shiftiness, tho postmaster's letter Is
In a class by Itself, und would bo
awarded the blue ribbon and sweop
stako by any commltteo of nwards,
whether Judged from an ordinary or
technical standpoint. This Is what
the postmaster says:
"In n recent lssuo of Tlie Republi
can, I was charged with having crit
icised County Treasurer Dalnes be
cause tho street numbers wero. not
placed on envelopes containing tax
notices, and an effort ib mado to
show that I was working with whnt
was called a "Shifty Democratic Ad
ministration" In thla county, to placo
tho treasurer In n false position be
fore tho public.
A. n mnttn, nf fnnt T rrttlrlsnil lin
ono nnd -have sought to bmo no ono
for tho fact that piles of letters con
taining tnx notices remain In the
I-ogan pootolllco nnd nro returned un
claimed to tho ttensurcr's ofllco be'
causo tho carriers cannot find tho
people to whom they should go.
I did suggest that If thero wero a
law requiring the street address to
ho placed upon the envelope, It
should bo cufo'iced and If there bo
no such a law then ono should bo
passed .
Just how that reflects on tho treas
urer of Cncho county Is not elenr to
me. Instead of trying to Injure Mr.
Dalnes I havo endeavored to help htm
where I could. When I found that
ho was violating tho rules of tho
Postal Department, I called his atten:
tlon to tho matter In order to savo
him somo embarrassment, and In
other ways I havo tried to assist him.
And, when talking of "shiftiness,"
tho thought occurs to mo that nono
of tho Democrats in olllco in Cacho
county now can compare with thin
samo treasurer in that respect. Ho
haB "shifted" about as much as any
ono can politically nnd It 111 ho
comes his champions to question tho
sincerity of anyone clso."
Notlco how ho did nnd ho didn't,
ho does and' ho doesn't, ho will and
ho won't, and your damned If you do
and damned If you don't. In para
graph 2 lie criticises no ono nnd In
pnragrnph 3 ho did suggest somo
criticism. In paragraph 4 ho could
not see how ho rollectcd on anyone,
while in tho Bnmo paragraph ho did
call attention to somo Infractions of
law and set tho offender rlgnt.
In paragraph 2 ho says ho criticis
ed no ono, nnd blames no ono for tho
"fuct that piles of letters containing
tax notices remain In tho Logan post
ofllco nnd nro returned unclaimed,
Is It not about tlmo that PostmaBtor
Illalr was criticising somo ono and
take stops to fix tho blamo for such
conditions? Is It not service tho
pcoplo want and not n postmaster
...l.t nn.mlla Inllfl.. nnntfllntttl- ttlV
notices to pile up In such a way with
out placing hlnmo or oven criticising
tome, ono? Again, ought not tho post
master to bo advised ns to whether
or not thero Is a law requiring tho
street nddresscs, etc., and not find It
necessary to "suggest that If there
wero n law It should be enforced and
If not, such a law should bo passed?"
As to paragraph 4 wo beg toadvlso
the postmaster that wo aro not tho
guardian of tho county treasurer,
ami If tho treasurer is nt fault It is
no concern of ours how much ho Is
crltlclpod, consequently wo can 'not
boo why the postmaster should wrlto
tn us In such nn apologetic way, 'nnd
wo respoctfully refer him to tho
treasurer hlmsolf for tho dollvery of
any apology that ho may havo to de
liver. And- now just smllo at the Inst
patagraph and then framo It as a ro
markablo oxample of "shiftiness."
Tho postmaster will please bo advlr
ed that no ono In connection with
this ofllco, and no stockholder tn this
paper had anything whatever to do
with tho election of tho present coun
ty trcasuror nnd If wo remembor cor
rectly, tho postmaster wns city chair
man of Logan City and had a great
deal to do with tho election of tho
present administration, tho treasuror
