THE HOUSE FEY.
At first thought the fiy appears
to be very fastidious in its per
sonal cleanliness. In amazement
we have watched its systematized
washings, robbings aud broshings!
How can this apparently neat lit
tie insect leave such a trail of vir.
nient poisons across oar food!
Let a house fly walk over a
plate ef cold meat which has been
boiled and jellied. In a few days,
springing from eaeh tiny foot
print, a growth ot bacteria may be
plainly seen! Try it—it will make
yon shudder—and think!
The table may be spotless, the
silver handsomely chased, the
china of the latest design—the
gnests may be witty, wise and
beautiful, bat the hoase fly, with
its germ infested feet, makes it a
banquet of death!
By the medical world the house
fly has been condemned as being
the most active and harmfni of all
man's foes, oarrying death to
more boraan beings than have all
the beasts of prey and poisopons
reptiles put together.
What a fearful charge! But
wait! A member of the United
States Public Health Service is
authority for the statement that
the "story of the danger of dis
ease from the house fiy has been
only half told." Think of it—
only half told!
While you are complaining
about them, flierare multiplying,
Statistics showing what mischief
they are already responsible for
will not serve to rid yon of them.
Be enthusiastic in yonr active
campaign against these enemies
to the family's health and bappi
When there has been a real
awakening to the perils of the
germ distributing dynamo called
the house fly, it is domed.—Edito

BILLS ON SPORTING
AND LIQUOR
INTEREST.
Baton Rouge, La., May
Hopes of staving off the
struggles that invariably
with legislation for or against
sporting and liquor intetests went
17
bitter
come
glimmering here today when a
torrent of bills of the blue law
type ponred into the two houses
of the Legislature. In the lower
branch, these bills made their ap
peaiance:
To make it a felony to sell
liquor without a license.
To throw rigid conditions about
the giving of prescriptions for
liquor by physicians.
To give cities the right to in
spect and tax liquor shipped in
from elsewhere.
To prohibit hunting on Sunday.
To prohibit gambling within
three miles of every school house
in the state, Orleans parish ex
cepted.
Granting city councils aud po
lice juries the right to prohibit
gambling and betting.
Making betting on an election a
misdemeanor.
On the Senate side a bill pio
hibiting the sale of near-beer in
prohibition territory was intro
duced.
From the other angle, Repre
sentative Lasseigne, of Lafourche,
offered a bill to grant parish local
option with reference to the Sun
day law, and Representative Ed
ward Schaiff, of the Eleventh
ward, New Orleans,

SHERIFFS DRAFT
CAMPAIGN PROGRAM
Parish Officials Meet In
Baton Rouge On Call of
Marion L. Swords.
By A. W. Newlin.
(Staff Special to Tlie States.)
Baton Rouge, La., May 16.—In
response to a call from Marion L
Swords, president of the Sheriffs
Association, a nomber of the
stale's sheriffs met in conference
at the Bast Baton Rouge court
house at 10 o'clock Tuesday to
outline a program of .action, rela
tive to the anti-fee bills that have
already appeared in this legisla
ture.
From advance expressions, the
sheriffs expect curtailment, but
they will contend for an adjust
ment that will fit the several par
ishes. President Swords says:
There are thirty two small par
ishes and thirty two big ones;
what would do for one would not
do for another."
Mr. Swords has a plan of ac
tion mapped ont.
"I would sugges:," he said to
The States correspondent, "that
the chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee call upon the
supervisor ot public accounts and
ask him to request from every
sheriff, every clerk of court, as
868sor or other official receiving
fees, to file with him a sworn
statement of how much the fees
of his office are; what the office
nets him and for any suggestions
that he may have.
With this data in hand,
wonld suggest that the Ways and
Means Committee hold a series of
public hearings. Let this mfor
mation be read, and given to the
public, With this data in hand,
a joint committee should be nam
ect from the Senate and House, to
take bold of the matter aud draft
a bill that will equitably adjust
the interest at stake. A bill
could be so drawn that it wonld
curtail the fee system, and yet not
be a hardship. That is all we
are asking."
Verj much in line with the pro
ject of Mr. Swords, the ball was
startet^ in both Senate and House,
Monday. In the former by Sena
tor Leon R. Smith, of Oaddo, who
introduced a concurrent résolu
tion for the creation of a joint
committee, three from the House
and two from the Senate, to take
up this whole subject matter and
work it ont.
J. M. Hamley, in the House, of
fered a concurrent resolution call
ing upon Supervisor McFarland
for the very information, which
Mr. Swords would secured.

lots which his petition claims w;il

urday evening and was an event
of more tbau usual interest.
Twenty five loyal sons of Loulsi
ana State were present at the fes
tival which was marked by a live
ly revival of college spirit evinced
in the singing of the old songs
and repeating yells of the campus
and stories of occurences in the
old days, and an atmosphere of
congeniality and good fellowship
prevailed.

Martiuvllle, presided as Toast

eloquent responses being made by
Judge James Simon, Hon. E S
Broussard, L. R. Tilly, of Jeaner
erette, Hilton Sandoz, Perry Wa
let, of Loreauville, Dr. J. W
Sanders and others. The speak
ers were frequently interrupted
by bursts of applause and laugh
ter.
Dr. A. G. Reed, who occupies
the chair of English at Louisiana
State, was ' the guest of honor,
and made an excellent speech in
the course of which he staled
that the aim of the University to
wards the youth of the State was
to inculcate such teachings as to
give them qualities of leadership,
courage and integrity. r
MOTHERS' 1>AY.

It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
1 wish every suffering woman would give
CARDUI
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when 1 feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are .«Jure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
