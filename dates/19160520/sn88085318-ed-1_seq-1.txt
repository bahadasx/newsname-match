Thursday was class day for the
seniors. About 10 o'clock the
seniors oould be seen issuing from
Kildow's house down Maple
street decked in all kinds and
shapes of costumes. Considera
ble difficulty was encountered in
trying to be as noiseless as pos
sible in parading up and down
the halls on account of the ex
aminations. The characters
were taken out of Mother Goose
Rhyme* for Little Folks, and the
presentation of them was good.
After parading the halls the stu
dents filed to the stage, where
they presented the stunts. Sev
eral pieces of stage equipment,
including a big (?) pile of hay,
testified to the early morning
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy

characters represented were:
Bessy Snooks and Tommy Brooks,
Margaret Waddell and Harry
Smith; Little Boy Blue, Clare
Lee; Little Jack Horn 'r, Roy

The domestic science depart
ment of the Colville high school
has issued a 70-page cook book as
a result of the work of the de
partment since its institution
Beveral years ago. The book not
only gives nearly 300 tried] rec
ipes, but gives the food values in
units, and the cost of dishes pre
pared, which are features not
found in other books. The
members of the classes handle
the nales, the profits if any to be
used in purchasing additional
equipment for the department.
The book sells for only 25c, and
is thus the greatest value ever
given in a cook book. Deliveries
will be made by members of the
class, and orders may be sent to
the class secretary Miss Lela Wal
ston, Colville, or to the Colville
Examiner.
