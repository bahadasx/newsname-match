Over
The trial of the case of 15 rover A.
Youngs vs. James Petrulas, et al.,
was brought to a sudden termination
in the district court last Saturday
when the attorneys for both sides
came before Judge Horsey and an
nounced that they had agreed on a
compromiso and later filed a stipula
tion setting forth the terms of agree
ment which they had arrived at. Un
der the provisions of the compact, the
plaintiff was to have judgement giv
ing him title to the Kathleen Nos. 1
and 2; and the Florence Nos. 1 and
2 lode mining claims located in the
Freiberg Mining district. Youngs to
later deed the Kathleen No. 1 to Pet
rulas, but reserving title to all the
ore extracted. Petrulas agrees to give
license to Youngs for the use of
all water flowing from the Kathleen
No. 1 claim, except the amount act
ually required by Petrulas and his
associates in-mining and for culin
ary purposes.
The settlement of the difficulty will
be. better for all parties concerned
and for the general welfare of the
Freiberg district. It is the intention
of' Youngs and Petrulas to immedi
ately take steps to operate the prop
erties now allotted to them.
Associated with Mr. Youngs will
be Mr. W. L. Leland of San Francis
co, who was in the city last week.

DEMIJOHN ORE ASSAYS
71 TO THE TON
Samples of ore brought up from
tho Demijohn Consolidated yesterday
by Fred W. Price," general manager
of that company, gave returns of
18.40 in gold, 23.5 ounces silver and
30. C per cent lead. That is equal to
J 71 a ton. This ore came from n.
drift on the 300-foot level adjacent
to a porphyry intrusive in the lime
stone. It is at a point about 200 ft.
from the working shaft, where a
drift has followed this mineraliza
tion for about 150 feet.
"The conditions there'are ideal for
the making of a big ore body," de
clared Mr. Price yesterday. "In fact.
I never saw every geologic and min
eralogical condition better than 1
found at the Demijohn on this trip
to Pioche. While the ore is coming In
in bunches, still the earmarks are
all there for its making at any round
of shots. It is a big open country
and It looks fine. In fact, the Demi
John never in its history presented
, so promising an appearance as it
does today. It is really the best
looking proposition that I have in
spected in a long time. Herald-Republican.

Filing Ground
PROPOSED EXTRA
LEVY FOR STREETS
A petition has been in circulation
among businessmen and taxpayers
which is to be presented to the
county commissioners at their next
meeting, asking them for a levy
commissioners to make an extra levy
on property in the Pioche school dis
trict, tho proceeds from which, it
is proposed, will be applied toward
the improvement of Main street in
Tioche from the school house to
Panaca Flat. It is proposed to
raise at least $1500, which would
mean an additional tax of abut 50
cents upon each $ 100 of assessed val
uation in the district.
The present condition of Main
street in Pioche is nothing short of
a disgrace. If the proposed im
provement will include the grading
and the filling in of the center
and curbing along the sides so that
the "water will be carried off with
out danger of spreading out over
the street, it will be a move in the
right direction.

Hacing commission." This represents
Lincoln county's proportion of the

at the Reno races last year. The
fund must be applied toward high
way improvements. The sum re
ceived is based on 64 6 miles of main

that no license be issued, and as the
board is governed by the desires of
the majority of any community, no
