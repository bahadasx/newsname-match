NOT YET OVER

trict are Being Very Rap
idly Improved.
Yuma, Ariz., Jan. 24.—With the
waters of the Colorado river receding,
the work of rescuing Yuma Valley
flood sufferers was carried forward to
day by local authorities, aided by offi
cials of the Southern Pacific railroad
from Tucson, Ariz., who arrived here
with equipment to supply the city
temporarily with water, gas and elec
tricity. It was estimated that the
damage from the flood would amount
to more than $1,000,000.
A large force of men was engaged
today in repairing the break in the
levee at Four Mile Post, above here,
which released the torrent of water
that inundated Ylma.
Practically every house in the Mexi
can quarter of the city was in ruins.
Many of the business houses still were
flooded with water and the two news
paper plants were out of commission.
It was the expressed sentiment of
citizens that the town should be re
built on a more substantial basis than
before, and to rebuild the broken
levee with rock- Steps already have
been taken for a bond election for the
expense of this work.
Conditions in Yuma valley were not
as bad as was first feared, the gov
ernment irrigating canals holding the
water back from the breaks in the
levees a)ong the river front.
Working in conjunction with the
Citizens' Relief committee, the South
ern Pacific officials opened the big
clubhouse of the railroad to the home
less and aided in feeding and caring
for. the,, seedy.
Reports" from" Gila- BMd, 750 tniles
north of Yuma, were that the Gila
riverhadtfallen five feet at that place

of-quick relief from the flood situation
here.
The South Paolfic railroad tracks at
Arizona station, across the river from
Yuma, were washed out last night.
The break was said to be serious.

as though a torrent of water had hit
the car. I got out and saw the diner

lay below the diner and on the brink
of the lower embankment.
"Everybody ran to the diner to help

In the car, but no further trace of
him was found and it is believed he
was cremated.
"The day coach was turned over. It
was a steel car and was burled in the
snow until almost invisible. People
inside were talking and screaming.
The workers were unable to get at the
windows and had to chop their way
into the car. It took an hour to
reach the first man. A little boy was
next, Arthur Smith. He was almost
frozen and we had to cut his clothes
from him and rub him in snow.
"For the first two hours we heard
a woman screaming before we were
able to reach her. She was cut and
bleeding badly and almost frozen. We
kept on taking the passengers out of
this car for nearly six hours."

Some of the London newspapers
were not satisfied with this statement,
pointing out that the British head
