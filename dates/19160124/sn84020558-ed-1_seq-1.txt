Yl'.MA, Jan. 23. With the waters of
llic Colorado river receding, work of
rescuing Yuma valley flood sufferers
was carried forward today by local
authorities, aided by officials of the
Southern Pacific railroad from Tucson,
Arizona, who arrived here with equip
ment to supply the city temporarily
with water, gas anil electricity. It was
estimated that the damage from the
flood would amount to more than
$1, 000,00V.
The river fell two and a half feet
this morning and continued to recede,
though it was still above the 33-foot
stage.
Under the direction of T. II. Will
iams, superintendent of the Tucson di
vision of the Southern Pacific, a large
force of men was engaged in repairing
the break in the levee at Four Mile
post, above here, which released the
torrent of water that inundated the
town yesterday.
Practically every house in the Mexi
can quarter of the city was in ruins
today. Many of the business houses
still were flooded with the water and
the two newspaper plants were out of
commission.
It was the expressed sentiment of
citizens that the town should be rebuilt
on a more substantial basis than be
fore. It was practically determined to
rebuild the broken levee with rock.
Steps already have been taken for a
bond election to meet the expense of
this work.
Conditions in Yuma valley were not
as bad as was at first feared. The
government irrigating canals are
holding the water back from the
breaks in the levee along the river
front.
Working in conjunction with the
citizens' relief committee, the Southern
Pacific officials opened the big club
house of the railroad to the homeless
and aided in feeding and caring for the
needy.
Reports from Gila liend, l.'.O miles
north of Yuma, were that the Gila
river had fallen five feet at that place
and was continuing to fall, thus offer
ing additional hope of quick relief from
the flood situation here.
The Southern Pacific railroad tracks
at Araz junction, across the river from
Y uma, were washed out last night. The
break was said to lie serious and it
was impossible to state when It woudl
be repaired.
The city water, electric light and
gas plants tonight were submerged
under ten feet of water.

Kut-El-Amara, in Mesopotamia, and
the Turks. Tiie battle took place at
Essin. seven miles from Knt-El-Ama-ra.
Tile British were unable to drive

The following official statement on

"Sir Percy Luke (the new comman

Two German air raids on the ciiTist

ro's two principal seaports by the Aus
trians and the taking by the Germans
of trenches from the French near Ar

of in the latest official communications
of London, Vienna and Berlin.

'welve hours later two German
seaplanes, fleXv over and dropped
bombs on the east coast of Kent. Nine
Vimbs were dropped by the aeroplanes.

Antivari and Dulcigno on the Adri

into the hands of the Austrians, which
leaves to King Nicholas only a few
miles of front on the sea and gives to
the Austrians command of the coast
from tin Gulf of Triest virtually to the
Albanian frontier.
Vienna reports that the Monteneg
rins continue to ".ay down their arms
and that in addition 1,!00 Serbians
have surrendered in the past few days,

Montenegrin army has declined to sur

STRIKE ALL IN
(Special to The Republican.)
CLIFTON, Arizona, Jan. 23. Owing
to the fact that all financial support
w hich has heretofore been tendered the
striking miners in the Clifton district
lias apparently been withdrawn, and
liiat funds available at the present
tune are only sudfucient to last until
tomorrow night, the collapse of the
long-drawn-out strike in this district
seems imminent.
At a large meeting of the miners.
held here this afternoon. Meyers and
Davies, representatives of the federal
department of labor, who have been
in the district for some time investi-
iting the strike situation, made some
startling revelations concerning the
financial situation of the unions which
are at the present time back of the
strike movement. ft was disclosed
that the treasuries of the miners' or
ganizations are very nearly depleted,
and that there seems but little hope of
any further contributions to carry on
the strike activities. So low have
ebbed the finances of the unions that
only enough money remains to support
the strike for twenty-four hours.
Stating that they had made an ex
haustive study of the matter, the
leakers advised the men to return
to work under the provisions of tin
proposition made by the mine man-
ers oh January S, based on 24-cent.
copper.
At the close of the meeting a reso
lution was offered calling on the men
to return to work as per the terms of
the companies' offer and agree to
submit all grievances to arbitration at
a date within the next thirty lavs. flic
resolution was voteO down by a Ma
jority of 2S votes. This is explained
by the tact that there was a desire
on 'he part of the miners to withhold
action .1:1 the matter until the men at
Morenci and Metialf had had a chance
to pass on the question. v
Davies and Meyers will address
meeting at Morenci and Mettcalf on
Monday morning, at which time condi
tions will be explained to the men of
those places. It is expected Uiat a
vote on the proposition will be taken
in ali three of the camps on Tuesday
morning, and it is generally believed
that the sentiment of the men will be
strongly in favor of returning to work.

DEATH AT Df BREAK-
OF DURAN
CATTLE
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO, Jan. 23. Bernardo and
Fedcrico Duran, the Mexican cattle
thieves, condemned to die by the Car
ranza authorities for' the killing of
Bert Akers at San Lorenzo, a few miles
bcMw the international boundary Fri
day, were executed at daylight today
in the cemetery at Juarez. The body
of Akers was interred here this after
noon. Tne bodies of the Mexicans were
buiied immediately, but that of Ber
nardo, v. ho confessed to having fired
the shots that killed Akers, was ex
humed to satisfy a doubt concerning
the identity of the slayer.
Douglas Downs, another American
who was with
Akers seeking stolen (
cows, and who escaped the bullets of
the Mexicans, declared last night alter
seeing Bernardo Duran that the pris
oner was not tne man. Downs was at
the Juarez cemetery when the face of
the executed man was exposed this
afternoon and then admitted that he
previously had been mistaken. Amer
ican Jificials were with Downs, and
their certification that the slayer had
been duly executed served tonight to
calm a feeling at Ysleta, where Akers
and Downs lived, which the authorities
bilieved might result in trouble.
Three Mexicans previously arrested
ill connection with cattle stealing at
Ysleta. were removed to jail in El Paso
for protection.
The Duran brothers died cursing
Americans. Bernardo appealed fbr
mercy on behalf of his brother Fed
rieo. 'It is unjust to kill two of us for one
American," he said. "It is giving two
exes for one tooth. I am willing to die,
because I killed the Gringo, hut my
brother ought to lie allowed to live."
The bullets of the firing squad killed
l edrico, but Bernardo was still cm
scions after be fell, and the officer
commanding the firing squad gave him
the ""mercy shot" through the head.
The execution was attended by about
fifly Americans, of whom a number
were women.
The first automobile carrying spec
tators reached the cemetery shortly
after three a. m.. It was greeted bv a
lone sentry and a chorus of dog barks.
The sentry growled that "the prison
ers had been shot and buried."

Rernardo gave his hat as a present to
a poiceman who embraced both pris
oners as they left the cuartel for the
exrcdtion ground.
Just inside the cemetery gate the
party halted for a last word with the
bandits.
"We want to hurry up and have it
over" said Hernardo in a growl, an
swering the question of tin American.
"There is nothing to say except that I
kilh'd I he American and am willing to

Captain Alfredo Ortiz, commanding

"I want to die as my brother dies"
said, Fedriio, who braced himself
against his brother and said:
"We are bad men, we kill the Amer
ican; xxe should die.
Captain Ortiz shook hands with the
prisoners and embraced them. Then
he stepped back and gave the orders
to aim and fire. .
The Durans sank to the ground.
From the ground came a moan:
"Oh senor."
The captain stepped to the bodies.
