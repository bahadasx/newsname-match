WORK TO
BE DONE
AT ONCE
Further development of Taco
ma harbor was projected today
when the city council began a
movement to deepen the middle
city waterway its far south as
llth st. during 1016.
The channel, if dredged, would
• permit large vessels to steam up
to the heart of the tldeflats man
ufacturing district, and would
open up for commerce not only a
large section of unoccupied flats,
but would Increase the value of
city property near the junction of
llth st. and St. Paul ay.
Ask 0.-W. to Keep On.
As a first move towards open
ing the waterway, the council
agreed to adopt a resolution
Wednesday asking the 0.-W. It. ft
N. to extend Its present dredging
operations to tha southern extrem
ity of Its property.
The railroad company already
lias a dredger at work tn the
northern end of the waterway,
and la building bulkhead along
the valuable tldeflats strip, on the
east side of the channel, which It
recently acquired at an enormous
figure.
, It has leased part of this prop
erty, and intends to develop it
commercially.
Never Opened Kor Use
The 0.-W. plans call for dredg
ing only one-half the length of
the channel, at present. This
still would leava a shallow stretch
of waterway between the city'a

property and deep water. If the
railroad company will dredge the
channel for the entire length of
its property the city will agree to
deepen the remainder, it was de
cided.
The middle waterway Is that
strip of water between the
Northern Pacific's filled In land,
and the St. Paul mill dock and
tramway. It runs as far south as
llth St., but has never been deep
ened sufficiently to be available
for vessels, or even small steam
ers.

You ask, Why does the democratic party deserve
the continued confidence of the-country? The answer
is, BECAUSE IT HAS MADE GOOD;
'. I. believe that there can be no fuller
to your question.

K*h Jtions of an unprecedented -character
with so satisfactorily.
K|* m This country Is -growing more non
mT^ Bipartisan every day. It is asking for an
te^atseag^efficient and an honest government, and
LAKE j s becoming more (indifferent as to the
labels which, for purposes ol coi-ordained action, men
bear.
And somehow it matters very little what any of us
may say regarding the merits n\r the demerits of a
party, for minds are seldom broughjt to a conclusion
by political speeches or political articles. The news
paper, which daily tells the story bf what is done,
gives to the citizen the basis for a judgment which he
makes independent of partisan'appeal.
In a word, I think it makes lit
tle difference what criticism Is
launched against the administra
tion or what any of us may have to
say in its praise. THE AMERI
CAN PEOPLE HAVE JUDGED IT

things which It has dons, and one
of the greatest things which It has
done has been to seriously disap
