BIGGEST STRIKE
IN HISTORY OF
NATION'S STEAM
LINES IMPENDS
Four Great Unions Vote to
Demand After March 1 an
8-Hour Day or 100 Miles
Instead of 10-Hour Day—
Leaders Do Not Expect to
Get This
OPPOSE ARBITRATION
IF IT BE PROPOSED
Believe That in Presidential
Year the National Admin
istration Will Not Dare
Oppose Them; Roads Will
Appeal to Public
A simultaneous strike on every
„
steam railroad of the United States,:
tying up more than 250.000 miles oL
rack, and paralyzing the nation's,
"reight and passenger business is the
plan of leaders of the four great na
tional railroad unions, should de-:
niands to be presented to the rail-j
roads after March 1 be refused.
A detailed discussion of the de-;
mends will lie held in this city next
Sunday at a joint meeting of two of
the largest brotherhoods—the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Engineers and
the Brotherhood of Locomotive En
ginemen and Firemen. At least 1500
o:" the leading brotherhood men from
all lines oast of Pittsburgh are ex
pected to attend the session and it is
understood that much of the talk of
ine day will be on the possibilities of
a strike beyond anything in the his-1
tor.v of railroading.
Among the speakers at the meet-1
ins, which isj to be held in Chestnut'
street hall, will be grand lodge- otli-;
cers of both brotherhoods. These
officers will present the plan of cam
paign to the assembled delegates.
Vote Passed Overwhelmingly
January 10 a referendum vote was I
submitted to the 360,000 to 4000,000!
members of these four unions upon |
the question of authorizing the offi-1
• ials to present certain demands toj
railroad owners. Information reach-j
«d labor leaders in New York City i
yesterday that authorization had been
vrted by an overwhelming majority,
although the official count will not be
made until March 1.
The labor union leaders will he em
powered to ask for an eight-hour day
or 100 miles instead of a ten-hour
day or 100 miles, except in passenger
service, with pay for overtime at one
and a half times the new higher pro
rats rate instead of the old pro rata
rate for overtime.
Cani|>alftn Outlined
An official copy of the demands was
obtainable this morning as well as
an authoritative outline of the cam
paign which the labor leaders have
prepared to enforce them. It. is of
• ourse subject to such modification as
labor developments may necessitate,
but at present the essential points are
these:
Upon completion of the count of
tin* referendum vote union leaders
will present the demands to e\ery
steam railroad president in the
United States, allowing thirty days
for a definite reply.
Offers to arbitrate, if made, will
he mjeeted immediately, as will
first offers of compromise, if made.
If the railroads refuse to meet
the demands, as the union leaders
anticipate, tlicy will ask author
isation of their members, by vote,
to declare a nation-wide strike.
With this authorization nego
tiations will be resumed directly
with railroad heads, and no gen
eral strike will be declared until
the latter have been given "full
oiiportunity to do the right thing."
If tlie.v fail to do this, as union

I tained after the confusion had died

tween the switch and the control, ef
fecting a short circuit. The box was
j not strong enough to stand the force
of the current flowing through it,
