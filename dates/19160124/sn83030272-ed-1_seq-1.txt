May Split Republicans
Party Leaders Think Whitman's Future at Stake in Big
Internal Quarrel Talk of Investigating Dis
trict Attorney Swann Now.
CHAIRMAN ASKED ABOUT NEW YEAR'S PARTY
Itopuhlicnn lcnilcts expressed the fear yesterday that tho rumpus
over (he Thompson leglslutlvo committee's Mils would disrupt the party in
that It had caused factional lights, weakened Its position In the coming elec
tion and Imperilled tho Hovernor's political future. Senator Sane., who Is a J
Barnes man, came, to the defence of Senator Thompson last night. It has
been pointed out that Senator Thompson has long been opposed to (low Whit
man. . Senator Itohert It. tiiwson of Brooklyn, a member of the Thompson
committee, upheld the committee's bill and said that he and Merton K. Lewis,
counsel for the committee, were preparing a resolution calling upon the Leg
islature to investigate the expenditures of all legislative committees dating
back to the Insurance invest Igatlng committee, of which Supreme Court Jus-
lice- Charles Kvnns Hughes was counsel, which existed during 1905 and 1906.
Senator l.ivvsoii said that District Attorney Swann might to lie Investl-1
gated for Investigating tho bill to the Slate. He expressed belief that the
present turmoil Is raised In an effort to keep tho committee from Investigat
ing: corporations.
Assemblyman .McQutslion said that lie too had prepared .a resolution
calling upon the Legislating to Investigate the oxtieitdlturcs of all legislative
committees. Ills resolution demands uii Investigation of the expenses In
curred by (iov. Whitman and his staff on their trip last summer to the San
Francisco fair.
District Attorney Swann denied that politics-caused his Investigation, i tunning by a block signal set to warn
The books of tho Hotel lilltmore will be taken to his office to-day, when , him that the other train was about to
further study will Ik- made of the expenses of members of the Thompson com- I cross Ills track.
