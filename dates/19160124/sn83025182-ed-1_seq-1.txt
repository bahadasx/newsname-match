NBW YORK, Jan. 24.—After fighting

reached the point where they feel
there is nothing loft to do but sacri

which they had hoped to spend the
few remaining years most of them

Uanbury hatters' case.
Martin Lawler, one of the original
defendants, now living in New York
today told of the discouragement of
the aged union men. The order of
sale of their homes has been approved
by the federal court.
"We Danbury hatters," said Lawler,
"have made our fight and lost. Our
appeal to congress was, we know, a

LONDON, Jan. 24.—A renewal of
German aerial attacks on London,
probably by squadrons of German
Fokkers, the "Uhlans of the air," was
predicted by the London press today,
In oommentlng on the raids on the
Kent coast yesterday, In which one
person was killed and six Injured.
Aernoautlo experts declared that
aeroplane attacks probably would sup
plant ZeppeMn visits until the weather
l.e more favorable for voyages by the
sky dreadnoughts. They called upon
the government to make better prepa
rations to defend London against the
giant Fokker battle planes.
The Times assailed the censor for
forbidding publication of the exact lo
calities attacked yesterday.
The Times declared that both raids
were witnessed by large numbers of
people, and that the German aviators
certainly knew exactly where they
were. Questioning the military ad
vantage of suppressing euch Informa
tion, the Times declared:
"There were two raids yeeterdsy,
lone delivered In brigM moonlight and
,the other at high noon. They were
witnessed by large numbers of people
who know exactly where It took plaoe.

raids showed the folly of believing that
London has been made Immune from

Law Was Passed by
[United Press Leased Wire Service]
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.—The fed
eral income tax was declared consti
tutional in the supreme court today.
The law was pasaed by congress in
1913, following the adoption by the
states of the income tax amendment
to the federal constitution. The de
cision was made in the case of Brus
haber, versus Union Pacific, brought
in the supreme court because the law
collected taxes prior to the date on
which it went Into effect, because it
collected taxes at the source and be
cause it was charged it Is Is
crimina
tory and taxes property without due
process of law. The great powers of
legislative bodies to levy taxes was
pointed out by Chief Justice White in
the decision, when he said:
"It Is, of course, superfluous to say
Sat
arguments as to the expediency,
levying such taxes or of the econ
omic mistake or wrong involved in
their Imposition are beyond judicial
cognizance."
Referring to the constitutional ob
jections brought against the tax in
this case. Chief Justice White said:
"So far as these nutaerous and
minute, not to say in many respects
hypothetical contentions, are baaed
upon an assumed violation of uni
formity clause, their want of legal
merit Is at once apparent, since It is
settled that clause exacts only a geo
graphical uniformity and there Is not
a semblance of ground in any of the
propositions for assuming that a vio
lation of such uniformity is com
plained of.
"So far as the due process clause
of the fifth amendment is relied upou,
it suffices to say that there Is no
basis for such relian-ce since it is
equally well settled that such clause
