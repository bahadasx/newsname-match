ALL JEWS IN AMERICA
10 HOLD AJONGRESS
To Take Steps to Settle for All
Time Jewish Question in
All Continents.
(BY ASSOCIATKD PRIES)
CHICAGO, Jan. 24?Plans for

ing by Sheriff Urn stead, who has been :
watching the situation since Saturday !

came alarmed by rumors of fresh
trouble.
Forty special deputies were still or
duty today, but1 there were no dls- j
turbances.
Frank Gurdon is in the city hos i

the efforts of Deputy John Palo Pedro
to disperse a noisy group of agitators
on a street corner. There were no
other casualties.Officials
of the Youngstown Sheet1
and Tube Company said today every !
thing is quiet at the mills and the?;
expect no trouble. fftsldents and
merchants of East Youngstown became
alarmed by reports that work
men were dissatisfied with the terma

this resulted in swearing in deputies, |
but the sheriff ^ald today these fears |
are unfounded.
The sheriff sees a source of danger
In the policy of East Youngstown
saloon keepers, selling Jiquor ir.
wholesale - quantity to foreigners,
however, and says stricter regulation

avert danger of future outbreaks.

Our Needed or Need
(Contributed by G. W. Dudderar,
o- :?;
In the organizing of agricultural
bureaus, the experiences of commercial
organization, secretaries have
been strikingly similar, very Instructive
ahd interesting and in some cases
quite funny. In repl? to questions
relative to this particular line of work
a letter from 'our friend, Irving C.
Norwood, secretary of the Davenport
Commercial Club, Davenport, Ik.,
will doubtless be interesting. The
letter is In part as follows:
"In the summer of 1912 the secretary
of this organisation and the.
president of the First National Bank,
who is a live one and wanted to make
himself, solid with tbe soil-tillers,
toured Scott county in a 1909 Cadillac
visible, distributing literature, call-1
lng meetings, ticketing the bell-cows |
of every township, and doing other
needful things in connection with the
formation of- a county . agricultural
organization. The-Commercial Club
provided an office,1 furniture, stenographic
help, and other necessaries,
the governVuent contributed $1,200 a
year, the business men of Davenport
dug up an even larger sum.^and the.
farmers of Scott county yielded
$124.19. With a favorable - wind
their moans could be heard for miles.
"Cheered by the remits, we induced
a'kindly millionaire with a
penchant for agriculture* to guarantee
the payment of any deficit that
might be incurred, and launched the
Scott County | Farm Improvement
League upon a chilly world. Then
we bought a second-hand Ford car
and a tank of gasoline, hired a solemn
young man from Ames, and we
were ready for business.
"Our Success was not exactly immediate.
Although the young man
from Ames can tell from looking at a
rolled oat whether It was planted
with a drill or a shot-gun, and Is
equally proficient In other directions,
he was at first the object of considerable
suspicion. Some farmers met
him on the wrong side of the front
gate, with their hands on their Ingersolls,
and some of them shooed
their stock in the barn when the
second-hand Ford car hore in sight.
His advice was as welcome as a case
or smallpox and was followed a* lit
