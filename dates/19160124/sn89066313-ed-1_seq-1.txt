on Sinking of Persia.
l!r United Press.

Department, following the denial of

paring a note to the Turkish govern

B T ..
THEY SAY
"It is a shame that a state with the
wealth and prosperity of Missouri
does not have better accommodations
for Its University
women," said Presi
dent James M. Wood
of Stephens College.
"Tlie Universit wom
en should be provided
with dormitories by
tin' state, and they
should have a build
ing that would be the
center of women's ac
tivities in the Universit. This build
ing should have ample gvmnasiuiu fa
cilities and shou'd be located on a
women's quadrangle.
"Columbia is particular! fortunate
In that it lias no railroad trunk line
connecting immediately with St luis
and Kansas City, for if such were the
case the smaller city would be in dan
ger of domination by the larger cen
ters "Since we have no direct connection
with the larger cities we have a unity
of purpose and a desirable University
atmosphere.
"Lawrence, Kan, for instance, is
located on three trunk lines. Its in
terests are largely dominated by Kan
sas City. The relation of the town
and the University, as indicated by the
circulation of the Daily Kansan, the
olhcial oigan of the School of Jour
nalism of the University of Kansas, is
not nearly so close as the relation of
the town of Columbia and the Univer
sit of Missouri, as indicated by the
circulation of the University Mis
sourian." STIEHM IN FIGHTIM; MOOD

.SinET MI.ESMEN IN HEUIMI
Companies o Ire After .Solicitors
fur ct Summer's Work.
Various companies plan to use over
four hundred students as salesmen
next tumniT. Student representa
tives of brush, cooking utensils, map
and book companies are now busy en
rolling men for work during the com
ing season.
J There are two brush companies
represented here, each planning to
use about seventy men. Twent-five
men are wanted to sell maps. A
cooking utensil company aims to get
a hundred salesmt n from the Uni
versity. Four book companies are
looking for a total of 220 agents.
, According to one representative, the
greatest value students get from their
'summer's work is not the mone hut
the experience. Before the men go
into the field the ate given a tourse
in salesmanship covering from four to
'ten wctks. With this preliminary
training they go out and learn sales
manship by experience. This man
thinks that any one who works all
summer and sells enough books to
pay his expenses during the school
ear will be able to make a success
when he gets out of school.
Training, however, is not the only
reward. Several book companies and
two other companies who employed
students from Missouri last ear claim
that the average man who worked
sixty clas made over $300 clear profit.
About half of the companies guarantee
their salesmen a certain profit, usual
1 over $200 for the summer, if they
work full time and fail to make that
amount.
All classes of students are employ
edfreshmen, upperclassmen, fra
ternity men, non-fraternit men, ob
scure men and prominent men.
I Freshmen seem to he the pick of
I some companies, chiefly because they
I are easier to sign.
I Another representative sums up the
whole matter when he says that the
firms need the students because stu
dents are good salesmen, and the stu-
' dents need the work because it pas
better in both experience and money
than any other work they can get for
the vacation.

Hofmann needs no introduction. His
name is s.vnemvmoas with piano per
fection He was bom in the Polish
eit of Cracow, where in the house
bold of his father, who conducted a
conservator of music, and his moth
er, who was an opera singer, he assim
ilated music as his daily food.
His first instruction on the piano he
had from his rather, and two ear.s
later, when he was f. jears old. he ap
peared at a public conceit and amaed
ever one.
When he was : he am.ued the
mighty Itubenstein with bis rare tal
ent, and it has been said that Hofmann
was the only "wonder-child" that Ku
benstein was ever interested in.
Has loured .Scleral Countries.
When he was 10 be filled his first
professional engagement in Berlin,
and then toured Denmark and Sweden
under the patronage of the Queen of
Denmark. Short afterward he
toured France and England and then
was brought to America, where his
scries of concerts created a furore not
soon forgotten.
"The power of personalit is the
vital thing in the world of art," wrote
Karlton Ilackett, or the Chicago Even
ing Post "It is this power, perhaps
even more than his extraordinary
command of the keyboard, which
makes his plaing sueh a vital thing.
He understands the piano: the pe
culiar ciuahties of the instrument
have become part of his being, and it
appears impossible for him to overstep
the hounds of what properly belongs
to the piano. He does not seek to
make it something else."

Dainrosch began his career at the
