Canvass of the sentiment in the
senate, it was learn! today, reveal
ed these facts:
That the democrats will solidly
support the president despite a feel

watchful waiting has failed.
That only a hare majority of the
40 republicans would vote to direct
the president to send the army into
Mexico and keep it there until order

That certain republicans. hilo

the outstanding figure of the war in

course, because he wanted to, Mr.

some questions dealing with the sit

The first question was whether

Alaschgerd. in Armenia. are re
treating on a ÖU-miles front, pursued
relentlessly by the Russians. Turk
ish losses have been very heavy and
the Türk have been compelled to
abandon a large amount of supplies.
hespite the intensely cold weather
and the deep snows in the mountain
regions the Russians are attacking
incessantly, using both cavalry and
in fantry.
It is reported on good authority
that owing to the terrific attacks of
the Russian forces Turkey has about
decided to abandon the project for
the invasion of Egypt.
Fifty thousand Cerman troops are
said to have arrived in Turkey re
cently, but if these soldiers are used
they will probably be thrown against
the Russians and the Rritish in the
trans-Caucasian. Persian and Irak

PARIS, Jan. -t. French military
experts see in the renewal of the
(ierman offensive in northern France
another effort to out a ,ath through
to the channel coast.
Following the successful Cerman
attacks near Neuville St. Vaast. a
great artillery duel lias developed on
the Rons front, where the Rritish
and French have been carrying' on
a long sustained and furious bom
bardment of the Ierman military
establishments and the railway lines
converging there.
Since the Cermans. by means of a
series of ferocious night attacks,
were able to establish a salient in
the French lines near Neuville St.
Vaast they have had to withstand a
severe bombardment and also strong
counter-attacks carried out with
great dash and bravery.
Artoi.s may again become the
t great battle such as that
which was launched by the allies last
spring when they pounded the (Ier
man lines for many weeks with ar
tillery tire which was incessant night
and day.
PRESIDENT AT DESK
LONDON. Jan. L'4. Attempts
were made by (Ierman aviators who
took part in two air raids over the
east coast of Kent on Sunday, to
drop bombs upon Rritish warships
in the Thames river, but these ef
forts were unsuccessful. it was
learned today. The German aero
planes used in the attacks were of
the Fokker type, bearing appliances
for the aiming of bombs. These
aeroplanes, the Hermans claim, are
better than any type in use in the
French or Rritish army.
Rritish military authorities believe
that the (Ierman claims were suc
cessfully refuted by the ease with
which the Rritish aeroplanes put the
invaders to Ilight.
The igilance of the Rritish pa
trols all along the east coast was
increased by the isit of the hostile
aeroplanes for it was feared that
these raids might be the prelude to
another attack by zeppelins.
The killing of one man and the
wounding of six persons, one a
woman, and three children, by Ger
man bombs, has aroused another
stomi of bitter criticism upon the
Ceixnan methods of warfare in the
English press.

When the trial opened today Atty.
Eew is took up the cross examination
of Mis& Gertrude Stevenson, the re
porter who gave to the police the
"alibi" note she said Rrown. in
Rristol jail, handed to her to carry
to his sister. Admittedly this was
the most damaging evidence against
Rrown yet introduced.
Lewis created something of a sen
sation when he opened fire on Miss
Stevenson. He handed the palpably
nervous girl a slip of paper.
"Do you know that man in Hos
ten" demanded the negro lawyer.
"Yes," Miss Stevenson answered
faintly.
Lewis tore up the slip, dropped
the pieces on the floor.
Atty. Gen. Rice acruseU Lewis of
improper conduct.
Justice Stearns admonished Lewis
that his action appeared at least
high-handed.
Lewis explained that he simply
was trying to keep out of the record
the name of Boston people in no
way connected with the case.
Lewis tried to discredit Miss Stev
enson by showing she would go to
any lergth to get a story ;nd that
at a Roston birthday party she
boasted she would testify against
the negroes.
She denied the latter absolutely.
The examination was painful to
the spectators. The admissions of
Miss Stevenson that she aided the
police while Rrown assumed that
she came from Mrs. Möhr did not
make a hit with t he listeners, but
the fact that the white girl was be
ing heckled by a negro lawyer, even
though Lewis was courteous, in the
extreme, won sympathy for the witness.
