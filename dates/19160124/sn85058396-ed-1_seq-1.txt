NO, YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T DIFFERENT
9 In every community there are those who say, "Ad-
M vertising may be a fine thing for Joe, Jim and Jerry,
m I but MY business is DIFFERENT."
M No business is so "different" that advertising will
S ) not make it bigger and more prosperous. NO busi-
-S , ness is so "different" that it does not possess features
B of interest to the public.
'S Advertising is nothing more nor less than acquaint-
'm ing people with you, your store, shop, bank or what
$1 1 not your goods, your services, your prices, your poli-
Hr cies. There is no magic or witchery about it. It is
3 proven, sound, business principle that pays big divi-
jj dends to the user, because it supplies people with infor-
"Ij mation they seek and need. It opens to the merchant a
I !jf wider market for his wares than he can possibly obtain
'';ip 50 cheaply in any other way.
1 If he can afford to advertise in large space, well and
j I good. But if his capital is too limited to justify the use
m of large space, the Want Department is open to him.
i In other words, if you think you can't afford a taxicab,
nODli lae a "Jitnev bus" at a fraction of the cost
' j I But do I hear some one say, "I'm not a merchant.
td'JI 'm a farmer, or a mechanic, or an upholsterer, or a
-TV man, or a day laborer how will advertising bene-
1 fit ME?" ,,1
vji Even so, you are a MERCHANT in the broad
m sense of the word. You have SOMETHING TO SELL
M vvhether it be goods or services. But you can t expect
J People to buy from you rather than from the other fel-
-M W, unless you keep them informed.
ZM The best "informer" that I know of in this part of

WATER POWER
States Can Exercise Right of
Eminent Domain in Con
demnation of Power Sites
and Water Rights.
Washington. Jan. 24 In a decision
of wide orfect to water power de
velopment throughout the United
States, tho Supreme court held today
that states possess the power to en
act laws authorizing condemnation of
power sites, and water rights by right
of eminent domain.
The decision was announced by Jus
tice Holmes In upholding the consti
tutionality of the Alabama water pow
er condemnation statutes in a caso
touching the improvement of Talla
hoosa river.
"The principal argument," said Jus
tice Holmes, "is that the purpose of
the condemnation is not a public one.
In the organic relations of modern
society it may sometimes be hard to
draw the line that is supposed to lim
it the authority of the legislature to
oxerclse or delegates the power of
eminent domain.
'But to gather the streams from
waste and to draw from them energy,
labor without brains and so to save
mankind from toil is to supply what
next to intelligence is the very founda
tion of all our achievements. If that
purpose is not public we should bo at
a loss to say what is."

INCOME TAX LAW
CONSTITUTIONAL I
United States Supreme Court
Upholds Measure in Opinion H
Handed Down Today.
FIFTY-YEAR FIGHT! H
Five Separate Suits Brought 'H
Bitter Contest in 1894 and H
1895 Joseph H. Choate M
Stout Defender. H
Washington, Jan. 24. The supreme M
court today upheld the constitution- M
allty of the income tax law.
Chief Justice White gave the court's H
decision, sweeping aside all the many M
objections to its constitutionality in M
whole, or in part. M
Chief Justice White announced the M
decision In the case of Frank R. JM
Brushaber, stockholder of the Union H
Pacific railroad, who sought to enjoin H
the company from paying the tax on M
tho ground it was unconstitutional. M
Most of Justice White's opinion was H
directed toward over ruling the con- H
tention that the income tax amend- M
ment provided a hitherto unknown M
power of taxation. Going far Into the fl
'history of Income tax legislation, the M
chief justice concluded the argument l
was without merit H
Advancing to other points, the chief IH
justice held that the tax was not un- H
constitutional because It was retro- M
tractive. H
The argument that the law was un- M
constitutional because labor, agricul-
tural and horticular organizations and IH
such were exempt, the chief justice H
was answered by decisions under the M
corporation tax law. He said the point H
was only another illustration of an H
erroneous assumption that the tax was H
Imposed under a new power conferred M
upon the government by the sixteenth M
amendment, wh'ereas it was a power H
recognized to exist from the beginning H
of the government and thus decisions M
defining the taxing power previously M
rendered were applicable to it H
Then grouping a number of other M
contentions against the law, all based H
on the clause of the constitution re- H
quiring uniformity in taxation, Chief H
Justice White pronounced them all H
lacking in merit because of previous H
decisions which determined that the H
clauses exacted only a geographical H
uniformity. H
The group included the contentions IH
that the tax lacked uniformity be- H
cause it jH
Levies one tax on incomes of in- H
dividuals up to $20,000 and a higher H
rate on incomes above that amount M
allows a greater exemption for mar- H
ried persons than single ones and fl
bases the tax on wealth alone. H
Because it requires corporations, at M
great expense, to perform the govern- M
ment's work, without compensation of H
collecting at the source; H
Because corporations indebted up- IH
on coupon and registered bonds are H
relieved of labor and expense in- IH
volved in deducting and paying the H
taxes of individuals upon the income H
derived from bonds; H
Because corporations required to H
pay at the source would ofien pay H
taxes for persons not required be- H
cause of exemptions to pay; H
Because bondholders, during the In- H
terval between the deducting and the H
paying of the tax on their bonds, are H
deprived of the use of their money ' H
withheld; H
Because bondholders of corpora- H
tions which fail before they pay the H
tax would be required to pay the tix H
although the corporation had deduct- H
ed the tax from the amount due the JM
bondholders; H
Because of double payment of H
taxes where corporations assume the H
payment of taxes on bonds; H
Because of the amount of the in- H
terest on indebtedness to be deduct- H
ed from gross Income of certain cor- tM
porations; H
Because Individuals are allowed to H
deduct from gross income dividends H
paid them by corporations, but cor- H
porations are not allowed to make H
such deductions; H
Because individuals whose income H
is less than $20,000 are allowed to H
deduct $3000 or $4000, but those re- M
ceivlng more than $20,000 are not al- H
lowed to make such deduction a sec- H
onri time for tho additional tax; H
Because greater deductions are al- jH
lowed man and wife living together m
than those living separately; JM
Because owners of bouses in which jH
they live are not compelled to esti- H
mate the rental value in making up M
their incomes, while those living In M
