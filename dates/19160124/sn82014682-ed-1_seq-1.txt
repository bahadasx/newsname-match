Maui, having xone over the scene of
the flood devastation of last week.
'There is not so much damage as
we thought there might be," said Mr.
Hobertson. "Much of the damage la
.what wight be called Invisible of

course, and will be seen as time goes
on. However, I believe that S0.0u0
will cover everything.
About ft dozen laborers' cottages j
on the Wailuku plantation were wiped j
out cy ice wver vr
acres cf cane down; In the stream
bed were completely swept away,"
- Mr. Robertson says that the topog
raphy of the river has been changed
greatly by the flood, filling In here and
digging out there, with. new. channels

WAILUKU, Jan. 22. Conflicting re
ports and opinions as to the number
missing are still prevalent in Wailuku
this morning. The coroner's Jury did
not hold a session before 10:30, ex
pecting that the ; searching parties
working along the stream might, find
the eight-year-old daughter of Mrs.
Sodetani. The1 girl is still missing,
and in spite of the most diligent
search no trace of her has so far been
found. '
Twelve bodies have been reviewed
by the Jury. Members of that Jury
have expressed the opinion that sev
eral bodies are yet to be discovered.
Many of those who lost relatives and
friends are of the same opinion, and
the most careful search in all con
ceivable places Is being kept up. The
calm sea of yesterday and today may
give up some of the dead at any mo
ment, for tbe torrent of raging water
was sufficiently strong even up to last
evening to carry away children, and
the stream Is still wide In many
places. It would not be at all strange
if the. missing should yet be found to
be dead and caught somewhere in the
stream or had been washed out to sea.
Were Warned by Roar.
It Is the unanimous opinion of all
the' rescue, parties and the police de
partment jot Maul that had the cloud
burst occurred an hour earlier on
Tuesday morning that the toll of the
dead would be four or five times what
it is today. By half past 4 or 5 when
the river began to swell, many of. the
families were stirring about, and by
the terrible roar were sufficiently
warned to get out of reach of the
flood.
The. Spanish. homes In Iao Valley
were washed away by the river cut
ting a new channel toward the Wale
fcu side of the gorge. Trees and
stones seemed', to more or less ob
struct the natural bed, and conse
quently the violence of the water at
this point can easily be understood.
Here the loss of life was the worst in
a small number of families. The river
took a' similar turn Just above the
Waihee bridge. The pile of stones
that had been brought downstream by
the rush 'of the water gathered in a
mass filling the usual 1ed of the river.
The water was again diverted toward
Waihee, and came pounding down up
on the .houses between the bridge and
the taro patches.
One .new house was taken clear
across the highway. Other houses on

BIO PUZZLE OF
LOCAL STOCKS
Comparison of Standing With
Onomea; "Big Men" Rumor
ed Trying to "Bear" Market
At $11.50 per share the stock jof the
Olaa Sugar Company, Ltd., affords one
of the ' puzzles of the market. Re
peateflly the stock, in its ; upward
climb, has halted, then receded under
heavy profit taking sales, always to
resume its climb under the stimulus
of eager buying. In comparison with
the . sale prices of regular dividend
paying stocks the present " price of
Olaa is difficult of explanation, from
the standpoint of what is known to
the general public.
Olaa's. Condition. ' ;
The condition of Olaa is this:..'.;,-'
The capital stock is 250,000 shares,
which at $11.50 per share would repre
sent a valuation of $2,875,000. In ad
dition the company has outstanding a
$2,500,000 bond issue at 6 per cent,
which calls for $150,000 in interest
annually, and has no sinking fund, so
far as is known.
The combined stock and bond valu
ations total $3,375,000, from which
must be subtracted $530,000, which is
what current street rumor gives as
the amount of cash on hand from last
year's operations.
It is generally known - that Olaa
made a net profit of about $850,000
(not Including depreciation) in 1915,
of which $315,000 must have gone to
wipe out. the indebtedness which was
shown in the last annual statements,
leaving about $533,000 on hand. O!
this latter amount it is known that
from $200,000 to $250,000 will be spent
on Improvements and enlargements to
the mill which have become absolute
ly necessary. ... i

Kiang Is the latest center of revolu

eastern strongho Id of the movement.
This province adjoins Kiang Su prov

The revolutionary movement In: Che
Kiang has grown so strong that Yuan
Shih-Kai, through the department of
communication , has , ordered - the
Shanghai and Hang Chau railroad not
to carry any military men of this prov
ince. This is- due to the rumor that
the military governor has .announced
that he will go over to the revolution
ary party. -' :
' It is announced from Peking that
the department of foreign affairs has
issued a statement that Yuan Shih-Kai
will not make an attempt to hold the
coronation while there Is a revolu
tionary movement in South China.
This statement was given out to the
foreign ministers today. -,
Military governors of Nanking and
Chi Kiang are proposing a Chinese
German alliance. Whether or not this
statement has been issued to thwart
the efforts of the soldiers of Yuan is
not kfiown. but It is certain that both
governors have a leaning toward the
revolutionary party.
Yuan Shih-Kai needs money to pay
the troops in the north. He has ask
ed American financiers In Hankow for
a loan of $400,000,000 to carry on hi3
campaign against the revolutionists.
The American capitalists have refused
tbe loan.

The Illinois river Is. rising fast

leave, tehind most .of their personal
possessions.. Hundreds, hav been res

of the spot where a Great Northern
passenger: train was wrecked by an
avalanche last Saturday.:
It is expected that It will take a
long time to find the missing passen
gers, owing to the depth of the snow
into which they were hurled when the
coaches were swept from the track.
A fall of 25 degrees in temperature
has turned the rain into snow and
averted floods in the entire lower Pu
get Sound country.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal, Jan. 24.
Tavel by land and sea Is disorganized
because of the storms that are sweep
ing the Pacific and western third of
the United States. Rain, snow and
gales in western United States and
the heavy winds off the coast have
caused railroads and steamship lines
to modify or abandon their schedules.
The steamer Admiral Schley, report
ed off Coos Bay, is now believed to be
safe, late wireless reports Indicating
that she can live through tho gale.
The steamer Ctntralia, also reported
in distress, is likewise thought to be
in no danger of foundering, though
she may be crippled and has lost her
deckload. ? v .. ;:, .
The North Pacific coast last night
and today was swept by a 94-mile
wind which caused much shipping to
hug the harbors and did some damage
to the-smaller fleets.
