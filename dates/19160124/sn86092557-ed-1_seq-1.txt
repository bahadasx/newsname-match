Five Separate Suits Over
The Act Reached the
Supreme Court.
Jan. 24.?The Su
premc Court of the United States to
nOay upheld the constitutionality of the
' ncome tax law.
Five separate suits to test the con
stitutionality of the new Income tax
Were brought In the federal courts
throughout the country soon after the
f law became effective and all found
their way to the Supreme Court of the
?,United States soon after.
For nearly fifty years the fight for
?i and1 against; a federal Income tax has
been somewhere In the courts.
, The Income tax imposed during the
Qiyii war and the years immediately
following were not attacked with the!
seriousness of later cases. It was not
|jnitil. the Cleveland administration j
placed an Income tax in the Wilson
|t?rifl act that the fight became serl
rhe contest over the validity of the
Rtaxpn, 1894 and 1895 before the Su
preme Court was one of the most blt
Ster/ever fought out before that court.
ionSiof. the' lawyers, James C. Carter,
ned the court against setting up,
its judgment; tp, thwart the will of
lion people. JoSeph H. Choate,
jopposlngi called upon the court to ex
ferclse lts Judicial power regardless of

Atvfl?K41ia- court decided that the

?om land because it was a direct tax
Snot apportioned according to popula
tion, and was unconstitutional as to
interest on municipal bonds. Only
Relight Judges participated and they
I,were evenly divided as to the validity
??of other features of the law. A re
liearlng was granted and Justice Jack
I'son,' then dying, took his place on the
gbench to listen to the last arguments
SiJt hlB lifetime. Justice Jackson voted
to sustain the law. Justice Harlan
'eated a sensation by announcing
? om the bench that another Justice
(had changed his mind over night on
tthe' question, and the entire tax, both
las] to reality and as to Income from
^personality was set aside on the
ground that It was a direct tax and not
apportioned according to population.

HARBINGERS OF
SPRING ARE HERE
Fairview Man Actually Saw
a Robin and Many
Heard Bluebirds.
A poor, lone robin with a red breast
and the spirit of a pioneer In Its
heart, was seen In Fairview yesterday
by "Doc" Shurtleft as he was starting
for Sunday school.
The robin had 'alighted in "Doc's"
yard and was looking for worms. When
"Doc" called his wife to see the early
I visitor, the bird was frightened and re
sumed Its journey toward the north to
seek a nesting place.
The robin Is one of the first signs
of spring in West Virginia, and this
bird has probably been deceived by
the sunshine and warm weather dur
ing the past week. By next week he
may wish he was back In Florida' if
the weather predicted by the almanacs
and. weather bureau arrives.
Oliver Shurtlelt is a school teacher
of unimpeachable character and any
suspicions as to the truth of this story
or the cause are without foundation.
Moreover a number of perfectly re
liable Fairmont people yesterday heard
bluebirds, although no one was found
who actually saw one of the little vis
itors.
Today the streets were filled all af
ternoon with crowds of pedestrians
enjoying the sunshine and air of the
Junelike day. Reports of robins and
bluebirds being seen and heard weri
In circulation. Every sunny place on
Main street was occupied by the vic
tims of the deadly Spring Fever, and
even women and children who have
not been outdoors all winter were out
today.
All records for high January tem
peratures may be broken today. The
highest temperature recorded last
January was 68 for this section. This
has already been passed this season
as last Friday the maximum waB 71.
The highest temperature recorded In
the past 25 years was In 1914, when
a maximum of 83 was reached. The
average temperature for January for
the same period was 32.2 degrees.

AMERICAN JEWS EXPECT TO RAISE
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN A DA Y
Appeal Without a Precedent
in History of This
Nation.
GREAT SUM IS SEEDED
Funds Will Be Received in
Every Community in the
Land.
BY KENNETH W. PAYNE.
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.?"If wo were
able to contribute $10,000,000, that, in
itself, would be insufficient!" ex
claimed Louis Marshall, chairman of
the American Jewish relief commit
tee, under whose' auspices half that
sum, $5,000,000, is to be raised in
America Thursday, January 27, !f hu
man efforts can accomplish it, to as
suage the untold sufferings of the war
hurt Jews of Europe.
The proclamation by President Wil
son of January 27 as Jewish Relief
day is without a precedent In Ameri
can history. But the leading Jews of
the nation declare that the sufferings
of the Jews in Europe as a result of
war conditions are equally unpreced
ented in the history of the persecu
tions -of any people. Heroic sffort3
must be made at once, they say, If a
large portion of their race Is to bo
preserved.
And eo into every corner of the
country, into every city and every
hamlot is going the appeal for con
tributions on that day to the Ameri
can Jewish relief committee. Around
the president's proclamation as a ban
ner It is hoped that Christians will
rally and will bear almost equally
with Jews the burden of raising the
huge sum required. Five million dol
lars, It is said, would constitute but
little more than ono dollar per capita
for the homeless victims in Gallcla.
Poland and Palestine.
Felix M. Warburg ia. treasurer of
the committee and reports that as yet
the million and a quarter whiefc .-.ft
was hoped New"York cfty alone^forad1
contribute has not been raised.
It Is a titanic task that confronts
the Jewish relief organizations In
each city of the country, if the need
ed fund is to be raised Thursday.
The first local contribution to reach
Simon D. Goodman who is in charge
here, was from tho congregation of
the First Baptist church, and was
made through T. L. Henderson, the
treasurer of the church. It was for
a substantial sum. Mr. Goodman may
be found at the Blumberg store and
he will make suitable acknowledge
ment of all contributions that are sent
to him.

WHY WAR-STRICKEN JEWS OF EUROPE
NEED FIVE MILLION AMERICAN DOLLARS
Here-,are some of the reasons the Americian Jewish
1 fur ^wa^^^e-raiSfe^Iarge
furidhere: f
In Russia alone nearly 760,000 Jews are homeless. Expulsion*, start
ed last May, hfcva been systematically followed up with deorees covering
a very wide territory, notices to Jewish residents to leave their homes
varying from 3 to 24 hours.
In May after the first expulsions had been put Into effect, the follow
ing number of refugees were reported by the Jewish Colonization Asso
ciation: Warsaw, 75,000 people; Vllna, 12,000; Klelce, 3,000; Konsk,
4,000; Minsk, 2,000; Prassnysh, 1,500; Radom, 2,000; Qussiatln, 1,200;
Shakl (Suvalkl, 1,500; Lomsha, 5,000; Khmelnlk,. Prov. Klelce, 1,500.
Since that time, these numbers have been Icreased almost tenfold.
The commercial life In the Russia Pale Is lying waste. The mer
chants, great and small, are ruined, and unemployment Is universal..' In
Poland alone there are nearly 300 towns that have suffered materially
from the war. I . '
In Vienna alone there are over 300,000 Gallclan refugees.
These refugees are huddled in Improvised lodging houses. In stables
and basements, antj In ruins of former buildings.
The soup kitchens are mobbed every day, and while they give aid
to a few hundred, needy thousands are In line clamoring for the elemen
tary needs of existence.
The misery of Palestine Is an old story. Cut off from communication
with Europe, upon whose capital It* lives, Its crops wasted, Its" fields
fallow and the plague destroying the orange crop?the Inhabitant* of
Palestine are Indeed In a sorry plight
