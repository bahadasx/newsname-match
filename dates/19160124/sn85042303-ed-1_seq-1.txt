FIFTEEN DEAD

AIBUFHLU
Sulphur Springs, Texas, Jan. 24.
The cases of the six Texas breweries
this afternoon are to be submitted on
pleas of guilty with promise of agree
ment, according to counsel for the
breweries and Attorney General
jLooney. Penalties aggregating $275,000,
forfeiture of charters, and an injunc
tion against political activities are in
cluded in the compromise.
The Dallas Brewery Company wfll
fight and ask for a jury trial.
The ouster and anti trust suit of the
state of Texas against seven leading
Texas breweries, was filed just one
year ago by Attorney General Looney,
who was here today to represent the
state's side of the case. The announce
ment that an agreement had hern
reached was no surprise to those who
have kept in touch with the case.
The compromise agreement was
made this afternoon, according to
plan, and was entered in court.
the mother of the child, who was
supposed to be at Xo. ?,7,h Lexington
avenue, Dallas, Tex., but 'a report
from that number stated that the
woman had been gone several days,
and Mr. nnd Mrs. Oakes left here at
one o'clock this afternoon for Dallas
to try to locate their daughter.
Their daughter, Sirs. C. C. Slaugh
ter, mother of the child, had warned
her parents that the grandparents on
the paternal side would make nn at
tempt to steal the child. Accordingly,
the child was removed from school
and kept at home for greater safety.
The paternal grandparents of the
child are Mr. and Mrs. W. B. Slaugh
ter of .l.-jlfi Lexington avenue, Dallas,
nnd the description given by the
negro of the man who took the child,
it Is claimed, suits the description
cf W. B. Slaughter.
Mr. Oakes stated today that when
Dorothy was scarcely a year old, her
paternal grandparents kidnaped her
and kept her for three years. The
mother of the child has been here
with her parents, nnd left but a
short time ago to stay a while with
the Slaughters in Dallas. She told
her parents that if she could not be
heard from, that they should insti
tute a search, as slip was not going
away nnd leave her children. A phone
message to the Slaughter home last
Saturday brought the reply that the
woman was up town and could not'
be Feen, and a phone message to the
home today brought back the reply
that she had been absent for three
or four days. The Oakes people are
puzzled over the matter, and have
gone to Dallas to investigate.
C. C. Slaughter was connected with
a national hank in Pueblo that failed,
and he was indicted and is in hKing
now. His wife stayed with him in
hiding for three months, and then
came here to he with her part nts.
W. B. Slaughter was involved in the
same failure, and Is out tinder l:iil
