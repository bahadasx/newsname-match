State Senator From This District
Would Have President Proclaim
Donation Day.
WOULD TEST THE
WILL OF THE PUBLIC
Large Sum Must Be Given, Patriotism
Aroused and Sentiment of
People Reflected.
To obtain funds for national pre
paredness direct from the people and
at the same time create a wave of
patriotism is the idea of State Sena
tor Leonard Nord of International
Falls, who has broached his plan to
some influential citizens.
Would Proclaim Donation Day,
Senator Nords' plan includes the
issuing of a proclamation by the
president, setting apart some special
day on which the people of the na
tion would be asked to donate their
pennies or dimes or dollars to a na
tional preparedness fund, donations
to be made at some public place such
as postoffices.
Let the People Speak.
"There is too much difference of
opinion in congress over prepared-
ness," said Senator Nord "If the
appeal is made to the people direct,
it will show in a concrete way what
the people want, and how much they
want it You can't controvert ar
guments in favor of preparedness
made in dollars and cents by the peo
ple themselves.
Patriotic Feature Important.
"Another phase that I believe most
important is the patriotism it would
arouse. The nation and its pros
perity is here and we take things for
granted But should a day be set
aside for such a collection to be made
it would set people to thinking. By
setting it far enough ahead by presi
dential proclamation backed up by
proclamation of the state governors
and given prominence by the news
papers the movement would gain mo
mentum By the time the contribu
tion day rolled around, I believe,
titers would be a furore of patriotism
and enthusiasm worked up.
An Estimate of Returns.
"Did you ever stop to think what
such a contribution would mean?"
asked the senator "There are ap
proximately 100,000,000 people in
this country Thousands might give
only pennies, thousands more, per
haps 10 cents to 25 cents each, others
might give from $1 up, and there
are millionaires who would give
large sums Should the contribu
tion average 50 cents each for the
population, $50,000,000 would be
contributed in spot cash and without
the bickering and quarreling of our
legislators. Congress would be im
pressed with the desire of the nation
as it could be in no other way.
"No matter which way the appeal
was received, it would be something
definite upon which to base an esti
mation of what the people want and
believe in

rw SANATORIUM
AT LAKE JULIA
MAY BE ENLARGED
In Case Capacity Found Too Small
Nurse and Patients' Cottages
Will Be Constructed.
MEETING TO BE
HELD FEBRUARY 15
Fee of Seven Dollars a Week for Resi
dent Patients Ten Dollars for
Non-residents.
The tri-county sanatorium commis
sion which is in charge of the man
agement of the Lake Julia sanator
ium will meet at the court house Feb.
15 to complete plans for the opening
ot that sanatorium. The commission,
which is under the supervision of
the state health advisory board, is
composed of A. G. Wedge, president
Dr. E. W. Johnson, secretary, both
ot Bemidji William Durrin and Asa
Jones of Koochiching county J.
Delaney and Dr. W. W. Higgs of
Hubbard county, and Charles War
field of Bemidji. The Bemidji mem
bers of the board represent Beltrami
county.
Completed May First.
The Lake Julia sanatorium which
is expected to be completed by the
first of May is being finished with a
view of enlarging. By providing an
extra large boiler and electric light
system and including nurse apart
ments within the sanatorium itself,
it will be possible in case the capacity
is found too small, to enlarge. In
case of enlargement a nurse cottage
will be built which can be lighted
and steam heated from the main
plant of the sanatorium. In this way
the capacity of the sanatorium can
be raised to 40. If place for 40
proves inadequate as many patient
cottages can be constructed as are
necessary.
Woman in Charge.
The direction and overseeing of
the building and patients will be
placed in charge of a woman super
intendent
The fees for patients are covered
by a state law and will be seven dol
lars a week for any patient who is a
resident of either of the three coun
ties A non-resident will be charged
ten dollars a week. In case the pa
tients are unable to pay the charges
the state pays one-half and the
county pays the remaining expenses.

IN CLERK CASE
Holds That W. N. Weber, City Clerk,
is Not Entitled to Back
Wages.
HELD CLERK HAS NO
FIXED TERM OF OFFICE
City Council Reduces Salary From
$75 to $30 a Month in
March, 1914.
Judge C. W. Stanton of the dis
trict court in a decision filed Satur
day sustained his former decision in
the case of W. N. Weber, clerk of
the municipal court against the city
of Bemidji for back salary.
Cannot Recover Salary.
Judge Stanton in a decision filed
in September held that Mr. Weber
was not entitled to recover in excess
of $35 per month and gave as his
reason that the tenure of the office
of the clerk of the municipal court
is at the pleasure of the municipal
judge and that he has no fixed term
of office. The first of last year the
council reduced the clerk's salary to
$30 per month.
The case was reargued several
weeks ago before Judge Stanton.
Appointed by Judge Crowell.
When Judge A. Crowell was
elected to the office of judge of the
municipal court in the spring of 1913
W. N Weber was appointed clerk by
the new judge. The clerk had pre
viously received $75 per month sal
ary as fixed by the city council. In
March, 1914, the city council reduced
the clerk's salary to $30 per month.
Mr. Weber has since served as clerk
of the court at the reduced salary.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
HELD CONSTITUTIONAL
Washington, Jan. 24.The Federal
income tax was today declared con
stitutional by the supreme court.
Five cases in which the income tax
law was upheld by the lower courts
were appealed to the supreme court.
These were grouped and argued in
October, 1915. The attorney gen
eral was allowed to file briefs in two
of these cases not involving the Unit
ed States.
The income tax law has produced
approximately $80,000,000 a year for
the federal treasury. It applies
only to incomes above $3,000, and
grants many other exemptions. It
was attacked when passed by con
gress, following the adoption of the
federal constitutional amendment
providing for the levying of such a
tax. The collection from corporations
of the tax on incomes derived from
bond investments, which made tax
dcdging difficult has been contested.
