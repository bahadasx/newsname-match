criminal charge; and find that there
i re certain prisoners now being con
lined within said county Jail who

and whose various sentences have not
yet expired, that there are nol other

count of an attempt upon the part of

find upon further examination that
the sills to all windows in that part

respectfully suggest that all window
sills in that part of said building
should be made of iron and steel, In
order to prevent and forestall further
attempts to escape Jail.
(2) After an examination of the
sanitary conditions of said jail we
would suggest that the bedding used

nuent airing; that the county commU-
sinners should furnish and supply for

ly protected, that the county furnish

INCOME
TAX LAW
IS VALID
Supreme Court of United States Holds New
Revenue Raising Act to Be Consti
tutional; Legality Was Attacked
in Five Suits
By United Press. ,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 24. In
a decision handed f'-'wn .today, the
supreme court held the federal income
tax law to be constitutional.
Five cases in which the income tax
law was upheld by the lower courts
ware appealed to the supreme court.
Thest were grouped and argued in Oc
tobcr, 1915. The attorney general
was allowed to file briefs in two of
these cases not involving the U. S.
In a complaiut against the Union
Pacific railroad, Stockholder Frank
R. Brushaber charged that part of the
law taxing incomes received before
Oct.. 3, 1913, was unconstitutional, be
cause the law was not then In effect.
He declared it discriminatory because
it exempted fraternal, agricultural,
business, civic and similar bodies. He
declared it took property without pro
cess of law by arbitrary fixing classes,
by exempting small incomes. He de
clared the provision compelling corpor
ations to ;iay one per cent upon their
coupons and bond interest income,
was unconstitutional becar.se they
might be paying on a coupon or bonds
owned by persons whose incomes were
not large enough to be taxed, but who
had not notified the company; that
the added bookkeeping necessary
would be unjust discrimination against
the company.
John F. r.nd H. E. Dodge of Detroit
said the law Is unconstitutional be
cause it levys an additional tax on the
net incomes of individuals and part
ners, but not upon tht incomes ol
corporations.
In the case of John R. Stanton, New
York, against, the Baltic Mining com
pnny of Borton and the Tyee Realty
company of New York against Collec
tor Anderson, the application cf the
law to mining companies and realty
investment companies was questioned.
The case of Edwin Thome against Col
lector Anderson cited tha same charge
us did Brushaber's complaint.
The income tax law has produced ap
proximately $SO,000,000 a year for the
federal treasury. It. applies only to
incomes above J3,000, and grants many
other exceptions. It was attacked
when parsed by congress, follownig
the adoption of tha federal constitu
tional amendment providing for the
levying of such a tax. The collection
from corporations of the tax on in
comes derived from bond investments,
which made tax dodging difficult has
been contested.

. DEVILS LAKE, N. D., Jan.
24. Despite its name, Devils
Lake i said today by A. L,
Johnson to be so good that a
city jail is an economic loss.
Johnson is waging a campaign
to have the city sell the jail
and use the county jail for
the few cases the 'city may
have. Johnson is president of
the Devils Lake city commis
sion. COLLISION
AT CORNER
It happened about 9:30 Sunday
morning. The car was being driven
along Fifth street by Iteece Smith:
the motorcycle was being driven along
Colorado avenue by an Afro-American.
In the car with Mr. Smith were
s-everal companions; on the rear of
tl.e motorcycle the motorcyclist afco
had a companion.
Time cards show that the auto-car
and the motorcycle were each due
at the intersection of Fifth and Color
ado avenue at the same time. Unfor
tunately the motorcycle seemed to be
running about three-eighths of a sec
ond late. This delay in schedule re
sulted in the motorcycle striking the
automobile about midway between the
steering and the propeller wheels.
The driver of the motorcycle per
formed a beautiful parabole, after
ward picking himself up apparently
uninjured. His companion, it is al
leged, was also uninjured. No one
is blamed so far as reports received
state.

hurt.

PENINSULA
Dusky Australians and New Zealanders
Drift into London Following Failure of
of British Campaign Against Turks;
Frightful Casualties Sustained
BEST PALS BURIED IN
GULLIES AND RAVINES
Funeral Rites Performed Under Cover of
Darkness and Graves Marked With
Crosses; Maoris Believe Spirits
Protect Dead from Evil Doers
By WILBUR S. FORREST,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, Jan. 8. (By Mail.) Aus
tralians and New Zealamlers are drift
ing into London since the abandonment
of the British position on Gallipoli
peninsula. In London tea rooms, on
street corners and elsewhere the tan
ned, burly Australians, the dusky
.Maoris and lighter complexioned New
Zealanders meet. They talk a, great,
deal among themselves about the
abandoned dead. ... .
"If. wasn't leaving tho place : that
hurt; It's the thought of a fellow's
best friends buried in those gullies
and ravines," said an Anzac fighter
today. He talked about the appalling
number of casualties suffered by the
Anzacs; of lonely cemeteries under
the cliffs, and in Shrapnel gully; ol
burials under cover of darkness lo
escape the enemy's fire and of mid-
night funeral services where the offi
ciating priest or clergyman could be
heard and not seen
-Almost every one of the thoiiiands
of graves at Anzac is marked with
a cross sometimes bearing a name,
but more often reading: "To the mem
ory of Fifty Australians," cr "To the
Memory of fifty New Zealanders." To
the niaoris it was not so hard to leave
their dead. They believe the placo
where a dead man lies is sacred:
watched over by spirits who would
do evil to , Intrduers. Grotesque
wooden Idols with sea shell eyes perch
garishly on sticks above the graves of
the Maori warriors. The true spirit
of humanity which animates the Turks
in their fighting is shown in the stories
of the Anzacs.
An Instance of this was shown in
May when both sides agreed to a bur
ial armistice. An imaginery line was
drawn through No Man's Land be
tween the trenches and pickets from
both sides patrolled it while search
ing parties from both scoured the un
derbrush of the hills and hollows. The
Turks brought the Christian dead to
the line, the Anzacs doing likewise
with the slain Mohammedans. Relis-
ous rites were hurriedly observed on
both sides as the bodies were placed
n hastily dug trenches. Crosses were
erected and the armistice came to an
end
It is th's spirit on the part of the
Turk thnt nml.es the Anzacs believe
that the last restini places of their
dead, crosses, iuscriinioj and all, will
not be molested Hundreds of Anzacs
will go back there after the war to
visit the silenfl graves It is declared
not Improbable that nil the crosses
marking the thousands of graves will
be replaced by more durable markings
of stone to forever commenaiorate the
memory of the dead
