BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 24. The in
fluences of the war In Europe are be
ing felt acutely in South America. The
routine of life, as fixed by the sea
sons and their phenomena, is thrown
out of 'gear. Immigration returns for
the first time in many years, show
a balance of emigration. This Is at
tributed to the exodus of Italian re
servists who has rallied to the colors
with enthusiasm and spontaniety. In
normal times the Italian and Spanish
Immigrants flock in about equal num
bers to the harvest fields of Argen
tina. The efflux has gone on in the
same proportion, for It Is a peculiar
fact, one which no one seeks to ex
plain, that the Spaniards, as it acted
upon by some sympathetic Influence
are leaving by every passenger steam
er. It cannot be said tnat they are
going in greater numbers, for the sim
ple reason that all those who are not
radicated in the Republic already rave
drifted away.
