NEW FEAR IS
OVER GREAT

Raids Over English Coast by
Fleets ol New Type of Ger

ror to People of England
London, Jan. 24. Tho "Fukker

Tlil now manifestation of tor r or
upplauts tho "Zeppeltu chill" by
rerntun of tho duuUlo attack upon tho
Kent const curly )nltrdy by tior
ln an aeroplaucs of tho now Fokker
typo.
England anticipates fresh assaults.
Tho press today, In commenting on
tho raid with It lint of one dead and
Is Injured, prodlcted that there will
bo a renewal of the attacks, presum
ably by whole squadrons of tho now
typo of air raider. Experts de
clared, too. that tho Fokker raid
.will undoubtedly supplant Zeppelin
attack until tho weather la more
favorable; and because of this, they
demanded that the government mnko
more preparations for defending
London.
Tho Times assailed tho censor for
forbidding publication of actual lo
calities of tho two attacks,
"There were two raids yesterday,"
aald this newspaper," "Ono In tho
bright moonlight, and tho other at
hliih noon. 1-argo numbers witness
ed them and knew tho locality. More
over, tho enemy apparently was un
dr no Illusion regarding the where
abouts of their assaults. Berlin Is
undoubtedly Informed now, and soon,
If tho censor permits, wo will publish
tho German account of tho locality."
At the same time, the Malt de
clared that the raids showed the folly
of believing that England Is lmmuno
from raids because of tho fact that
she hud not been attacked for several
months.
"Theso attacks," said the paper,
"confirmed the prediction of Plight
Commander 'Hilling that aeroplane
raids were apt to bocome more dan
gerous than Zeppelin raids."
In tho midst of anxloty over these
new uhlans of tho air, came word
today from tho Chronicle correspond
ent nt tho front that a British avia
tor had routed two Fokkers and a
third German piano.
New York, Jan. 24. That the
double raid on Kent county yester
day by the now German Fokkers ac
tually Included bombardment of Ion
don Is believed here today. Kent
county Includes part of London, and
nt tho same time, the Umdon Time
mention of "largo numbers" witness
ing the raids londs strength to tho
Idea that the metropolis was hit.
Ippfrtln, Tla Sayvllle, Jan. 24. Ger
man naval aeroplanes bombarded
tho station, barracks and dooks of
Pover, England, early Sunday morn
ing;, tho admiralty announced today.
Dover Is in Kent oounty, 00 miles
southeast of London. In Kent county

cording to official announcement
from Londom, though tho locations

It llos opposite the Fronch town of
Calolfl, forming ono of tho chief ports
of communication between England
and tho continent. It has shipbuild
ing and oall and rope making works.
Its population Is over 41,000.
The Berlin report apparently dis
credits the report that London Itself

metropolis was visited during the
jeeoond raid.

GREAT ASSET TO
STATE OF OREGON
II. J. Adams, of Portland, who has
been In this city during the' post week
lu the Intercuts of nflnlng develop
ment, has shown considerable Inter
est In tho proposition to ibulld a road
to the Josephine caves. Mr. Adams
has had under discussion with local
people plans for the -extensive devel
opment of tourist travel through
southern and western Oregon, and
believes that urh development
should now engage attention. Mr.
Adams has often visited southern
Oregon, going to tho Josephine cavos
last season with Frank South, and
be Is now an cnthuslnst over the un
derground marvel, lie has also seen
Crater lake, the springs at Ashland,
and the other scenic wonders of tbo
district, and believes that there
should bo absolute co-operation In
this development of the tourist
travel.
"Tho tourists are already develop
ed." says Mr. Adams. "Tho tourist
class and Its expenditures Is grow
ing rapidly. Catering to tourists Is
a business with established business
principles. I believe that southern
Oregon has about as large a stock-in-trade
to offer the tourist and the
seeker after healthful recreation as
has any part of the globe except
only for tourist accommodations. It
will take only an Intelligent capitali
sation of such resources, with proper
facilities and organisation, to build
up a tourist business that will add
annually a large sum total to the
business of this district."
If plana of Mr. Adams and his asso
ciates are carried out, largo expen
ditures will be made towards making
tourist accommodations Invltlug to
tho general public.

EXECUTES
Reprisals Against Americans
Are Anticipated Following
the Action ol Carranzistas
at Juarez Sunday
El Paso, Jan. 24. Mexican repris
als against Americans are feared as
a result of tho Corronzlsta execution
of Bornardo and Frederlco Duran, in
retaliation for the slaying of Bert
Akers, American.
The two men had many friends
across the border, and their death
Increased tho ill feeling apparent in
the past few weeks between the Mexi
cans and tho "grlngoes."
The Durans went to their death
before a Mexican firing squad at
Juarez at dawn yesterday, with
curves on their lips for the Amer
icans.
Frederlco, the elder brother, ad
mitted he had shot down Akers be
cause tho latter was trying to enter
the Duran homo while searching for
"rustled" cattle; but ho protested to
the end against taking tho life of
his brother, whom he held to be In
nocent. "Wo are dying for the cause of
Mexico against the Americans," said
Frederlco grimly, juat , before the
rifles cracked. Dernardino fell mor
tally wounded, and a Mexican stepped
forth from the firing squad to give
blm tho "tiro do graclas," the
mercy shot. .
Authorities fear that the Durans
may become martyrs In the eyes of
tho Mexican peons, and as a result
a reign of terror may ensue. The
display of the corpses Sunday in
Juarei seemed to provoke anger
rather than fear among the many
Mexicans who viewed them.

DANGER
Remnants of Montenegrin
Hosts in Retreat Toward
'Adriatic, With Austrians
Trying to Cut Off Escape
Rome, Jan. 24. Remnants of the
persistent little Montenegrin army
are In grave danger of capture.
After occupying the Montenegrin
seaports of Antlvari and Dulclgna,
the Austrians are beading eastward
to cut oil the retreat of the Monte
negrins to the Adriatic from Scutari,
for if the defenders escape and reach
San Giovanni do MedUBa, ships will
carry them to Corfu.
As rapidly as possible, the Serbians
In Albania are heading for this Greek
city. Within a fortnight only Italian
troops in Albania will dispute with
the Austrians the possession of the
eastern Adriatic coast.
Montenegrin officials confirmed re
ports that King Nicholas adopted the
ruse of getting an armistice from the
Austrians in order to gain time for a
retreat. As a result, it is feared the
Teutons will wreak a bloody ven
geance upon civilians when the trick
comes to their knowledge.

seal any trace of the Saturday morn
ing tragedy. Workment started
blasting in the pile of dirt and rock
that swept before it the two coaches
lying at the bottom of the gulch, and

The hillside swept by the slide
Saturday is covered by snow and ice
forty feet deep, and in no place less
than eight feet deep. Through this,
the gigantic task of locating the
bodies of the missing goes on.
Up, more than 200 feet, from the
little pile of twisted steel and char
red timbers of the dining car and
passenger coach that were swept
down the mountainside, the tracks
have been torn away by successive
slides.
Snow is still falling in the moun
tains, : ;"" i"

INCOME TAX
COURTS
Supreme Tribunal Supports
Constitutionality of Heascre
WKcb Was Tested ia Rye
Separate Cases -
Washington, Jan. 24. The federal
income tax was held by the United
States supreme court today to be con
stitutional. In the case of Frank R. Brushaber
against the Union Pacific Railroad
company, charging that taxes were
collected for a period prior to the
time when the law was in effect, and
claiming that the law was discrimin
atory in drawing classes, and that
likewise it took property without due
process of law, the court held that
congress passed the law In 1913, fol
lowing adoption of the tax amend
ment by the states.
The decision was rendered by Chief
Justice White, who pointed out the
great powers of legislative bodies to
levy taxes.
"Of course," he said, "it Is super
fluous to say that arguments about
the expediency of such taxes or the
economic mistake or wrong Involved
In their Imposition, is beyond judicial
cognizance."
via nsWer'to-the objections that
the law violates the national pro vi
sions for apportioning taxes among
the states according to population, he
said: . . ' . JJ
"The want of legal merit is appar
ent, since it is settled that the clause
exacts only geographical uniformity
and there is not a semblance of
ground' for assuming that violation
of such uniformity is complained of.
"As far as the due process of law
clause of the fifth amendment to the
constitution is relied upon, it suffices
to say that there is no basis for such
reliance, since it is equally settled
that such clause Is not a limitation
upon the taxing power conferred up
on congress by the constitution.
"It is not true that although there
is no express legislational provision
prohibiting it, the progressive feature
of the tax causes it to transcend the
conception of all taxation and be
comes a mere arbitary abuse of pow
er which must be treated as wanting
in duo process of law." '
Five cases in which the Income tax
law was upheld by, the lower courts
were appealed to the supreme court.
These were grouped and argued in
October, 1915. The attorney gener
al was allowed to file briefs in two
