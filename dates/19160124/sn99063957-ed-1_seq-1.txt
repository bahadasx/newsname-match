DEAD BROTHERS DURAN
LOOKED ON AS MARTYRS
Display of Corpses of Mur
derers Provoked Anger
Instead of Causing Fear
El " Tiiso, Texas, Jan.. 24. Mexican
Toprisals against Americans are feared
as a result of the Carranzista execution
of Bernardo and Frederico Duran in re
taliation for the Blaying of Bert Akers,
American.
The two men had ninny friends across
the border, and their death increased
the ill feeling nppnreiit in the past few
weeks between the Mexicans and the
"gringocs."
The Durnns went to their death be
fore a Mexican firing squad at Juarez
nt dawn yesterday, with curses on their
lips for the American.
Frederico, the elder, admitted lie had
phot down Akers because the latter was
trying to enter tho Duran home, while
searching for "rustled" cattle; but he
protested to the end ngaiust takintr
the life of his brother, whom he held
to be innocent.
"Wo are dying for the cause of
Mexico against tho Americans," said
Frederico grimly, just bofore tho rifles
rrnckod. Berna'do fell mortally wound
ed, and a Mexican stepped forth from
tlio firing sqund to give him tho "trio
de grncias" mercy shot.
. Authorities fear that the Dura ns may
become martyrs In tho eyes of the Mex
ican peons and as a lesult that a reign
of terror may ensue.
Display of the corpses Sunday in .In
ure, seemed to provoke nnger. rather
thun fear among many of the Mexicans,
who viewed them.
Carranza's Good Work.
Washington, Jan. !!4. Execution of
(ho Duran brother!, Mexicans, at Ju
arez, yesterday were regarded here to
day among authorities as a demonstra
tion of General Carranza's anxiety to
protect Americans. The swift action
of the Juarez officials had the ten
dency to allay somowhnt intervention
limitation in congress.
No immediate action is planned by
the foreign committee, on the various
Mexican resolutions recently presented,
nor will the president present his re
port on Mexican conditions, asking bv
the senate, until he returns from his
stumping tovir two weeks hence.

sistent little Montenegrin army are in
giavo danger of capture.
After occupying the Montenegrin
seaports of Antivari and Dulcigna, the
Austrians are heading eastward to cut
off the retreat of the Montenegrins to
the Adri.itic from Scutari, for if the

FOKKER' 18 LATEST
GERMAN WAR HAWK
' 10 RAID ENGLAND
Double Attack Made Sunday
By This New Type of
German Aeroplane
RAID IS BELIEVED TO
HAVE BEEN ON LONDON
One Attack Made at Havre Is
Witnessed by Many But
All News Suppressed
London, Jan. 24. The "Fokker
fear" is upon England.
This new manifestation of terror
supplants tho "'Zeppelin chill" by
reason of the double attack upon tho
Kent coast early yesterday by Ger
man aeroplanes of the new Fokker
type.
England anticipates fresh assaults.
The press today, in commenting on the
raid with its list of one dead and Six
injured, predicted that there will be a
renewal of tho attacks, presumably by
whole squadrons of tho new type of
air raiders. Excerpts declared too that
the Fokker raids will undoubtedly sup
plant Zeppelin attacks until tho weath
er is more favorable; and bocnuso of
this, they demanded that tho govern
ment make more preparations for de
fending London.
The Times assailed the censor for
forbidding publication of actunl local
ities of tho two attacks.
"Thero were two raids yesterday,"
said this paper, "one in trie bright
moonlight, and the other at high noon.
Large numbers witnessed them and
knew the locality. Moreover, the en
emy apparently was under no illusions
regarding tho whereabouts of their as
saults. Berlin is undoubtedly Informed
now' and soon, if the censors permits,
we will publish the German account of
the locality."
At the same time, the Mail declared
that the raids showed the folly of be
lieving that England is immune from
raids because of the fact that she had
not been attacked for several months.
"These attacks," said the paper,
"confirmed the prediction of Flight
Commander Billing that . aeroplane
raids." .
In the midst of anxiety over these
new Uhlans of tho air eaiwe word to
day from the Chroniclo correspondent
at the front that a British aviator had
routed two "Fokkers and a third Ger
man plane.
New York, Jan. 24. That tho double
raid on Kent county yesterday by the
new German Fokkers actually includ
ed bombardment of London is believed
hero today. Kent county includes part
of London, and at the same time, the
London Timog mention of "largo num
bers" witnessing the raids, lends
strength to the idea that the metropo
lis was hit.

NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE
Washington, Jan. 24. The
seeds of a firm union between
the Pan-American countries
was seen today-by internation-
nl law experts in the "declara-
tionoftho rights of nations,"

Fashioned after the declara-
toin of independence, it holds

enco and protection if they do
not encroach on the innocent 9
states; that they have the right
of independence and happi-
uess under similar conditions;
that nil nations are equal; that
they have exclusive territorial

BIG BLOCK OF HOPS
E
Louis Lacbmund Closes Deal
With Oregon Hop Growers
Association
"A good block of hops has been sold
at a satisfactory price," was the an
nouncement made by Manager Clark of
tho Oregon Hop Growers' association,
this morning. Mr. Clark donied, how"
ever, that the sale was made to E.
Clements Horst and said that it was
made to Louis Lachmund of this, city
who represented a London firm. The
officers of the association said that no
deal had been made with tho Horst com
pany as was rumored Saturday and that
the only deal closed by the association
was with Mr. I.achmjnd of this city.
The headquarters office of the asso
ciation stnted 'today that tho present
outlook for hops was the best at any
time till."- season and that the dealers
were active and that better prices wero
being offered to all outside growers as
well as the members of the association.
M'. Clark declined to announce the
price paid for the hops by Mr. Lnch
mund or the quantity and simply stnted
that the sale was of a substantial block
and that the price was satisfactory in
every way.
Rumor of Duty Not Felt.
The rumor that Englnnd hud placed
a duty of 8 1-2 eenw per pound upon
hops has not affected the market here'
in any way as the dealers are said to lie
offering better prices when the nnturnl
treu:l would be to reduce the price S 1-2
cents per pound if there was any likeli
hood of an import uutv being placed in
the Eiiglish ports. The hop growers
in general today are jubilant over the
success of thn Oregon Hop Growers'
association aa it is believed that the
nrg.'inir.niorf - of the association has
caused the price to hold up this yenr
when the outside conditions indicated a
low price had tho growers been unorg
anized. Tho Brewers' Bulletin, of Jan
uary 111, savs of Oregon hops:
"The California market containucs in
a steady position, though no new soles
have been made in tho Inst two days.
The Oregon market shows no special
chanee. Activity, while not prominent,
is sufficient to keep the market steady.
There is no business except in common
and medium grades. Good prime brew
imr hops cannot be bought under 12c
and growers are seeking as high ns 15
cents for choice goods. Offers of 13 1-2
to 13 cents find no acceptance among
the growers. Demand from brewers
continues light in the local market
though the eastern trade reports a mod
erate Inquirr. Quotations to brewers
remain as follows;

Yuma, Ariz.j Jan. 24. As the Colo
rado and Gila river flood waters reced
ed today, the damage in the valley here
was estimated at $250,000 with four
reported dead. One is known to have
perished. A second flood crest is report
ed advancing upon the city, duo to
reach here this afternoon.
Mexicans driven from their homes in
the lower end of town by tho deluge are
being sheltered in tents and shacks
above the high water mark, on Ike site
of Yuma's new business district! It is
intended to abandon the present flooded
business section and rebuild ns soon as
possible on land 25 feet above the dan
ger mark.
Kcports from the Imperial valley indi
cate that all dnms. pntes and levees are
holding except the California Develop
ment company levee which broke and
let the wnters rush through.
As the water in the river is falling,
however, little dumngo hns been done.
Railroads in Arizona and through the
Imperial valley are completely demoral
ized. An effort was made to route
trains through a branch line on the
Mexican side of the line, but It fulled
and all cars were, turned back.
Several parties of refugees, driven
from little ranching communities in the
paths of the floods, arrived here to
day. They reported that there were a
number of other wandering bands on
their way here.
These peoplo are destitute. Their
homes and lnnds havo been swept away.
In many cases they drive before them
small bunches of cattle and carry house
hold goods on their backs. One such
band numbers. 75, Including many wo
men and children.
Stories told today by those who fled
from danger points show that many
lives were probably saved by couriers
who rodo ahead of the suddenly rising
waters, carrying a warning.
This was especially true at the Six
teen Mile post. Government employes
fled on horseback, escnping.with their
lives but losing everything in camp.
i The protection works in tho Volcano
Lako region are believed sufficiently
strong to withstand tho shock of the
torrent, but tho crest of the flood is
not duo there until today.

New York, Jan. 24. Professionals

their selling orders with direful pre
dictions about tho future, they sent the
list down ono or two points in the ma
jority of speculative issues, and more

Railroad issues, inactive for tho last
week, wore more prominent in tho trad

age industrial shares. The outside
suying Interests was , restrained and
this gavo the bears an opportunity to
increase their advantage. They did this
by discussing the labor situation on

TO INQUIRE OF TURKEY
If Turkey Did Not Sink the
Persia Evidently She
Was Not Sunk
Washington, Jan. 24. Tho United
States will inquiro of Turkey regard
ing any knowledge sho may have of the
sinking of the P. and O. liner Persia,
Secretary of Stato Lansing said to
day. This announcement followed publica
tion of press reports that Turkey was
the nation responsible for tho destruc
tion of the vessel, with a loss of over
100 lives including that of American
Consul McNeoly.
Germany reported that hor subma
rines had returned to their bases and re
ported they had nothing to do with the
Persia case; Austria has tentatively
reported she did not torpedo the ves
sel.
Ambassador Morgenthau at Constan
tinople will ask the Turkish government
for information as Ambassador Penfield
asked Austria in case the latter the re
ports, ns anticipated, that she is ignor
ant of how the torpedoing occurred.
With Austria and Germany eliminat
ed, Turkey remains the only possibility.
Lansing indicated that this inquiry has
been planned from the outset." Tho de
partment thinks that the inquiry prob
ably will not dovelop anything new, but
it will make tho investigation complete.
Supreme Court Upholds
Federal Income Tax
"Washington, Jan. 24. Tho federal
income tax was held by the supreme
court of the United States today to be
constitutional.
In the case of Frank R. Brusnaber
(.gainst tho Union Pacific railroad com
pany, charging that taxes wore collect
ed for i period prior to tho time when
the law was in effect and claiming
that tho law was discriminatory in
drawing classes, ana tnat imewise u
took property without duo process of
law, the court held that congress pass
ed the law in l'.H3, following adoption
of the tix amendment by tho states.
The decision was rendered by thiol
Justice White, who pointed out the
great powors of legislative bodies to
lew taxes. " '
"Of course," ho said, "it is super
fluous to say that arguments about the
expediency of such' taxes or the econ
omic mistaKe or wrong involved in
their imposition Is beyond judicial cog
nizance."
In answer to the objections tout the
law violates tho constitutional provi
sion for apportioning taxes among the
states according to population, he said,
"their want or legal merit is apparent,
since it is settled that theAclauso ex
acts Only geographlc.il uniformity,, and
there is not a seinmance or ground tor
assuming that violation of such uni
formity is complained of."
"As far ns the due process of law
clause of the fifth amendment to the
constitution is relied upon, it suffices
to say that there is no basis for such
reliance." ho continued, "since it is
equally settled that such clause is not
a limitation upon tue taxing power con
ferred upon congress by the constitu
tion. "It is not true, as insisted on, that
although there is no express legislation
nl provision prohibiting it the progres
sive teaturo ot tne taxes causes it io
transcend the conception of all taxa
tion and becoino x mere arbitrary abuse
of power which must be treated as
wanting in duo process or law."
After hearing of the income tax de
cision, congressional leaders that rev
enues from this form of taxation -will
be used to furnish most of tho money
needed for tne preparedness program.
