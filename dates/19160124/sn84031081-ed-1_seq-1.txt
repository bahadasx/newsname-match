Not that the democrats have any

larger than a man's hand that some

clone may be discerned on the horizon
by the aid of a telescope.
Onlral Committee Meeting.
The state central committee lias
been called to meet in Santa Fe, Feb-l-itjry
4, to select a successor to for
mer Chairman James JIaye Puxton
"and f"r such oth.r business as may
lawfully come before the committee."
All sorts of business may lawfully
come before the commit tee.
For instance, t litre Is former Dis
trict Attorney E. I). Tittman, of Hills
boro, who has sent out to all members
of the committee nnd to a miscellan
eous assortment of democrats, not to
mention the newspapers (if the state,
a letter protesting against the way the
affairs of the party have been run
In the past. Just what Mr. Tittman
has on his chest has not yet de
veloped; but Mr. Tittman Is a man who
knows how to express himself in vigor
ous language when occasion re
quires, and It is the opinion that he
is coining to Santa Fe looking for,
somebody to step on the tail of hls!
coat. j
The committee meeting at Santa Fe
is likely to develop almost, anything-1
It may be a love-feast, with every-!
body hanging oil somebody else's
shoulder nnd h 11 flinging in dose, har
mony, or it may bo u riot with the air
thick with Irish confetti. The man
who can guess what will happen when
the democrats get together next

Yuma, Ariz., Jan. 23. With the
waters of the Colorado river receding
work of rescuing Yuma valley flood
sufferers was carried forward today
by local authorities, aided by officials
of the- Southern Pacific railroad from
Tucson, Ariz., who arrived here w ith
equipment to supply the city tempor

It was estimated that the damage
from the flood would amount to more
that $1,000,000.
The river fell 2 Vu fei't this morning

still above the 33-foot stage.
