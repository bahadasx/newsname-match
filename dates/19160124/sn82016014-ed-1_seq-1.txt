BREWERSJIVE UP
Two .Missouri Concerns Enter
lleas in Supreme Court.
Others Are Expected to Follow
in a Short Time.
ORDER OF OUSTER IS ISSUED
In the Case of the Syndicate
Bottling Company.
Kansas City Breweries Com
pany Will Pay $1,000 Fine.
Missouri brewers this afternoon
gave up their fight to do business in
Kansas and two of the six concerns
recently proceeded against by S. M.
Brewster, attorney general.' entered
pleas before the supreme court. Other
brewers are expected to follow this ac
tion. Companies which surrendered
this afternoon were the Syndicate Beer
Bottling company and the Kansas City
Breweries company, both of Kansas
City.
The culmination of the fight be
tween the state and breweries came
this afternoon when attorneys for the
two defendant companies went to the
attorney general's office and stated
that they wanted quarter. Both com
panies then went before the supreme
court and judgment in favor of the
state were entered in both cases.
In the case of the Syndicate Beer
Bottling company, a complete order of
ouster is issued. This order prohib
its the company doing business in
Kansas or sending- its- wagons or
trucks into this state for the purpose
i ""-""s iiiiuruih "M""'.
' eral weeks ago the attorney general
j brought ouster suit against this com
Pany for the purpose of blocking the
delivery of liquor on the Kansas side
by wagons and trucks owned by the
defendant company. The order issued
by the supreme court in the case of
the beer bottling company is a perpet
ual order of ouster.
Fine of $1,000.
With the plea of guilty by the Kan
sas City Breweries company, a fine of
I $1,000 is carried. Recently the su
preme court issued a contempt cita
; tion against the company for viola-
tion of an order in the brewery ous
i ter suits of 1908. It was charged in a
recent petition by Brewster that the
I company had violated the court's or
i dor and was engaged in the delivery
! of intoxicating liquor in violation of
th? original order. The plea of guilty
in this case means that the breweries
company has given up its fight and
agrees to leave the state for all time.
A fine f H.OOO Will alSO be paid
Both companies also agree to pay
all the costs in the case. These costs
amount to several hundred dollars,
j One bill is for $300 for the feeding of
several teams owned by the brewery
interests. These teams were seized
; when thp court issued an order a.ara.inst
the defendant companies several
weeks ago. Win field Freeman, re
ceiver for the companies, must also
be paid.
i T. A. Pollock, of Kansas City, repre
! senting the brewing interests, appear
ed before the attorney general today
: in the settlement of the case.
According to reports received at the
! stats house, the Dick Brothers com-
pany and other wholesale liquor con
I cems will probably enter pleas in the
ouster and contempt cases in a few
: days. The pleas today arc accepted
j as a surrender of the fight by the
i brewers.

secretary of state UUs afternoon
affirmed the decision of the pic
ture censorship board and barred

announced that the case would be
taken to the courts.

that the picture would !e brought

Morning's Action.
The action taken by the state mov

follows:
Vesting himself with the power of a
state and the judgment of 1,670,000
men. women and children, W. D. Ross
sjs the state censor board rejected
"The Birth of a Nation," the greatest
film production the world has ever
known. Ross did not so much as con
fer with Miss Carrie Simpson, a state
censor, who favored the showing of the
picture. He admitted having "over
heard" a conversation which indicated
the attitude of the appeal board in
event the picture was rejected. So
Ross acted.
"The Birth of a Nation," Ross de
cided, was too immoral for Kansas,
That was the decision of one man who
decided for a state on perhaps the
greatest motion picture the world has
known.
"The picture is rejected because it
is not proper,, is not instructive, and

Thousands of Visitors From
Over the State Expected.
Kansas will receive a formal intro
duction to the first lady of the land
when President Woodrow Wilson
comes to Topeka Wednesday, Febru
ary 2. Official announcements from
Washington state that Mrs. Wilson
will accompany the president on his
western speaking trip. In Topeka the
president's party will probably be en
tertained at a luncheon at the home
of Governor Capper.
With the news that Mrs. Woodrow
Wilson is coming to Kansas, a social
feature was today added to the state
wide political concern in the visit of
the president. The president's party
will spend five hours in Topeka and
Kansas society will make the most of
the opportunity to meet the president's
bride in those few house. Because
President Wilson has urged that his
speeches (be recognized as non-partisan,
the committees in charge of the
entertainment will be composed of
both Republicans and Democrats. By
the same token. Governor Arthur Cap
per, Republican, will be host to Presi
ident Woodrow Wilson, Democrat.
Will Iteach Here at 10. '
The president's party, including the
president, Mrs. Wilson and members
of the president's official staff, will ar
rive in Topeka at 10 o'clock Wednes
day morning, February 2. The trip
from Deft Moines .to Topeka.' will -toe
made by special train over the Rock
Island. The train will take the pres
ident's party In the afternoon, leaving
here at 3 o'clock.
Preparedness will be the principal
topic discussed by the president. Tele
grams trom w ashmgton announce
that the president will outline in de
tail his policies before congress and
will urge national support of these
measures by both parties. Need of
national defenses and the administra
tion's program for a larger army and
navy will be discussed in the speech
in Topeka.
Thousands Are Coming.
Plans now being worked out by
persons in charge of the meetings
probably will result in bringing thou
sands of visitors to Topeka for the
meeting. Several special trains prob
ably will be run to accommodate out-of-town
persons who desire to hear
the president's speech. Messages re
ceived by hotels today indicated that
every Democrat of note in Kansas
would come to Topeka for the Wilson
meeting probably the president's
only visit to this t.tate during the cam
paign. Requests that the president and
Mrs. Wilson bu entertained privately
while in Topeka have resulted in plans
for the president's entertainment at
the home of Governor Capper. A se
lect party of prominent Kansans will
attend the luncheon.
The president will speak at 1
o'clock in the afternoon. Immediate
ly following his Topeka speech, he
will leave for Kansas City, where he
will speak at a night meeting.
After Topeka to St. Louis.
Washington, Jan. 24

Washington, Jan. 24. The supreme
court today upheld the constitutional
ity of tho income tax law.
Five separate suits to tst the con
stitutionality of the new income tax
were brought in the federal courts
throughout the country soon after the
law became effective and all found
their way to the supreme court of the
United States soon after.
For nearly fifty years the fight for
and against a federal income tax has
been somewhere in the couits.
Attacks Not Serious Then.
The income tax imposed during the
Civil war and the years immediately
following were not attacked with the
seriousness bf later cases. It was not
until the Cleveland administration
placed an income tax in the Wilson
tariff act that the fight became
serious.
An agitation for an amendment to
the constitution came to nothing until
President Taft recommended the en
actment of an excise tax on corpora
tions to be measured by their income
and an amendment to the constitution
to permit the levying of an income
tax on all income. The amendment
was submitted to the state at once
and was proclaimed the sixteenth

REAK "HEAT" RECORD
Temperature Reached 60 in Topeka
This Afternoon.
Tlie temperature record for this
date was shattered this afternoon
when the mercury mounted to 60 de
errees at 2:40 o'clock. The previous
' hif-h murk was 58 degrees, estab
lished in 18UZ.
Weather of the April variety pre
vails in Topeka today, but the pros
pect is for a reversion to near-winter
temperature. The Kaw river is fall
ing but there is still a large amount of
ice. and some danger in case of a rise.
The situation is not so serious as two
days ago as the river has fallen to 7.2
feet. The stage on Saturday was 9
feet.
The forecast calls for unsettled
weather tonight and Tuesday: colder
tonight and much colder Tuesday.!
Fresh to strong northerly winds are

ing was in the soutn, Dut tnere was a
prospect for a change by tonight.
The lowest temperature last night
was 38 degrees. This is the normal
night temperature for the first week
of April. "This morning one might
imagine he could hear the birds sing
ing," said S. D. Flora, local observer.
"In fact a lady told me that she had
seen a woodpecker here. In case of
extreme cold weather there is danger
to the fruit as the high temperatures
of the past few days has brought out
the buds on the trees."
In 1S94 the mercury went down to
14 degrees below zero, the lowest tem
perature on record for this date. The

expected to go near this noint, as the

The lowest temperature at Topeka
tonight will be about 20 degrees. The
shippers' forecast calls for 10 degree
