HOW THE (HI. SUBWAY
SITUATION STANDS
Administration, Progressives and Socialists Seem to
Line Up Together Interesting Points From
Geo. E. Hooker's Report.
' For the first time the Socialists,
Progressives and the administration
forces seem to have lined up against
an ordinance in the city council. They
don't like the ordinance served up by
the transportation committee which
tells three engineers to go ahead and
plan subways. But they are fighting
it for widely different reasons.
Michael J. Flaherty, head of board
of public works, wants to build the
subway himself. He has not been
opposed by the mayor. The Socialists
want public ownership, and the Pro
gressives don't want to see the water
Jogged stock of-the "L" and traction
companies or Arnold recognized in
the proposed ordinance.
Bion J. Arnold, now head of the
board of supervising engineers, has
pulled more than $200,000 out of the
city treasury in the past ten years.
He has turned in many different re
ports on solving the transportation
problem. The best was taken up by
the City club and George E. Hooker,
secretary of the club, enlarged on the
plan and put out a book proving that
Chicago could develop .the best,
quickest, safest, most economical
and healthful method of transporta
tion in the world by through-routing
the steam railroads.
Here are extracts from the report,
the most complete of its kind made:
