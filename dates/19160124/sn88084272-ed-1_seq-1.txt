Litigation Covering Period
Since Civil War Is In
volved In Decision.
LOWER COURTS
ARE UPHELD
Long Fight Has Been Bitter
ly Waged Through Va
rious Administrations.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 24.
The supreme court today up
held the constitutionality of
the Income tax law. Five separate
suits to test the constitutionality of the
' lax -were brought in the federal courts
throughout the country soon"after the
law became effective and all found
their way to the supreme court of the
United States soon after.
Chief justice White ave the court's
decision, sweeping aside all the many
objections to its constitutionality in
whole or in part. -
Mjst of justice White's opinion Vjs
directed toward overruling the conten
tion that the' Income tax amendment
provided a hitherto unknown power of
taxation. Advancing to other points."
the chief justice held that the tax was
noc unconstitutional because it -was
retroactive.-
Exemptions Form' no -liar.
The argument Hat be law was nn.-coBtituUonaItiacaJifi(ra4bova5iIcul-'.
tural and hprtictrttnra! WgsnllaTtDns
and such were exempt, the chief Justice
held was answered by decisions under
the corporation tax law. He said the
point was only another Illustration of
an erroneous assumption that the tax
was imposed under a new power by the
1 Gth amendment.
Then, grouping a number of conten
tious against the law. all based on the
;,i use of the constitution requiring
uniformity in taxation, chief justice
White pronounced them all lacking lif
merit, because of previous decisions
which determined that the clause ex
acted only a. geographical uniformity.
The income tax imposed during- the
civil war and the years immediately
following were not attacked with the
seriousness of later cases. It was not
jntil the Cleveland administration
placed an income tax in the Wilson
tariff act that the fight became serious.
The contest over the validity of the
mi in 1S94 and 1895 before the supreme
i ourt was one of the most bitter ever
fought out before that court. One of
the lawyers James C Carter, warned
the court against setting up its judg
ment to thwart the will of 60,960.60
oeople. Joseph H. Choate, opposing,
called upon the court to exercise its J
uuui.icf rcgaiuicss u a.uj pujju-
lar populistic propaganda.
Court Is Divided.
At first the court decided that the tax
was unconstitutional as to. rents from
land becau-3 it was a direct tax not ap
portioned according to population, and
was unconstitutional as to interest on
municipal bonds. Only eight judges
participated and they were evenly
divided as to the' validity of other
features of the law. A rehearing was
granted and justice Jackson, then dy
ing, took his place dn the bench to
listen to the last arguments in his life
time. Justice Jackson voted to sustain
;he law. Justice Harlan created a sen
sation by announcing from the bench
that another justice had changed his
mind over nitrfrt on the ouestion. and
the entire tax, both as to realty and !
to income irorn personalty was set aside
on the ground that it was a direct tax
and not apportioned according to pop
ulation as was required by the consti
tution of direct taxes.
Conirtirution In Amended.
An agitation for an amendment to
the constitution then h,egan. It came
to nothing until president Taft recom
mended the enactment of an excise tax
on corporations to be measured by their
ipcome and an amendment to the eon-,
stitution to permit the levying of an
income tax on all income. The amend
ment was submitted to the states at
oace ?nd was proclaimed as the 16th
amendment to the constitution on March
1, 1915.
Five Snits Filed.
Congress availed itself of toe first op
portunity to exerciseithe new power
incorporating into the tariff act which
became effective October 2, 1913, the
present income tax. Five' suits, all
challenging the validity of certain
features of the tax were:
Frank R. Brushaber. stockholder of
the Union Pacific Railroad company,
seeking m the New York federal courts
xx enjoin the company from paying the
tsx. v
John F. Dodge and Horace E. Dodge,
manufacturers of Detroit, Mich, in the
Michigan federal courts, to enjoin the
Internal revenue collector from col
lecting the tax, largely on the ground
that it discriminated against copart
nerships in favor of corporations.
John R. Stanton, stockholder of the
Baltic Mining company, in the Massa
chusetts federal courts, to enjoin the
company and others from paying the
tax. largely because of the five per
cent annual deduction from income al
lowed mining companies for ore de
pletion. Tyee Realty company, in the New
York federal court, to enjoin the col
lector of Internal revenue.
Bdin Thome, in the New York fed

John Seddon; the first man in from
the California 'side, said his house in
the Bard Indian reservation unit of the
Yuma irrigation project was washed
away.
He said he took refuge on the roof
and floated about in the flood waters
for six hours before being able to reach
land. While on the house, he saw a

this morning and continued to recede,
though it was still above the 33 foot

Cnder the direction of T. H. Williams,
snperintendent of the Tucson division of
the Southern Pacific a large force of
men Sunday repaired the break in the
levee at four mile post, above here,
which released the torrent of water
that inundated the town Saturday.

Manv of the .business houses still were
flooded with the water and the two

citizens today that the town should be

Reports from Gila Bend. 156 miles
north of Yuma, were that the Gila river
was contlauing to fall, this offering ad

flood situation here.
The Southern Pacific railroad tracks
at Araz station, across tire river from
Yuma, were washed out. The break
was said to be serious and It was im
possible to state when it would be re
paired. Bard Is Under Water.
Apprehension was felt for the safety
of residents opposite here on the Cali
fornia side of the Colorado river, which
section had been completely submerged
by the water flowing through the break
at Araz station. The town of Bard and
the Indian reservation were completely
under water. Many houses were seen
floating down the stream.
Siphon Canal Broken.
A four mile break in the main siphon
canal along that side could be plainly
seen.
It was practically certain that all of
the valley near Gadsden was under wa
ter. Rumors that the Laguna dam had
burst proved groundless.
The only death here has been that of
mayor Charles C. Moore, who succumbed
Saturday to heart failure caused by ex
citement when the town was flooded.
Arrangements were made to send
boats with provisions and clothing to
succor those made homeless by the
flooding of Bard and the Indian reserva

MOTOR CARS.
Editor 1 Paso HeraM:
--I regra.t very much that I -was unable to take a.h auta?r of the ex
cursion arranged by The Herald to the Chicago automobile show. The en
terprise shown by The Herald in arranging this excursion is commendable
and in keeping with the policy your paper has shown toward the aatomobOe
industry in this eity.
It may not be out of place to eall year attention to the e(-vl'-ut results
obtained by this firm from advertising in The Herald. Prior to opening
the Franklin Motor Car company, I was in the southwestern territory for
another firm, and am thus in a position to state positive!? the conditions
tlirougbout the territory. Wherever I went, from Tucson on the west to
Tucumeari on the east, I found that the better ofasa of citizens all read the
El Paso Herald.
When I wanted to put before the newspaper-readmg public of the south
west the good points of the air-eooled Franklin automobile. I ued the ad
vertising eolumns of your paper. The Franklin not n the cheap or so
called popular car class, but appeals more directly to the motorist who wants
real automobile value at a fair price. I believe, from my experience both "on
the road and as a result of ray advertising, that The Herald reaches all such
persons in this territory.
Yours truly. I.eo. J. Trost. Manager.
