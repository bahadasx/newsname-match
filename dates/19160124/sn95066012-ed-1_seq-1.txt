Lines But Were Stopped By
Severe Storm.
Washington, Jan. J!4. The United
States will make immediate inquiries
6 the Turkish government as to
whether or not it is responsible for
the sinking of the British merchant
ship Persia with the loss of American
lives, according to a statement made
from the office of Secretary Lansing
tills morning. ! .
The state department' is in posses
sion of unofficial information that a
Turkish submarine ' was responsible
for the disaster and that the Turkish
war office will make no denial of the
report.
London, Jan. 23. General Aylmer's
relief force last Friday attacked the
Turks who are strongly entrenched at
Essian, six miles east of Kut-el-Amara
where the main British army, to
whoBe aid the relief force is trying to
hasten, is bottled up. A violent bat
tle ensued in which success alter
nated between British end Turks. The
fighting lasted all day. Torrents of
rain causing floods prevented a re
newal of the attack ,on the following
day, but General AJymer's force man
aged to entrench Itself little more
than two-thirds of a mile within the
Turkish line. ,
The British report speaks of "very
heavy losses on both sides," which In
dicates the fury of the battle.
BYRON'S UNHAPPINESS.
His ley, Frozen Mannered Vife and
His Cruel Parents.
Marie Corelll, the English novelist,
eays poets do not really love. If they
did they could not write about it
They imagine they love. And their
imagination embraces many fair ob
jects. !
"Byron," She says, "was an unhanpy
man. But he was not as unhappy as
he imugined himself to be. lie found
pleasure, even inspiration, in dwelling
on his own troubles. Many poets do."
She teUs us that Byron's mother had
boon a Miss Gordon before she mar
ried the shiftless and dissolute Cnptnin
Byron, the poet's father, and that amid
constant qunrrellngs, thrashings and
unjust abuse and the most coarse mid
iniemperate language poor Byron be
gan his career.
"With such a father and such a
mother," says Miss Corelli. "the won
der is tiint he managed io store his
mind with so many impression of
beauty and grandeur nud that lie was
able to lift his soul above his surround
ings to such a height of intellectual
power. Ills mother's furious temper
and ber cruel mockeries stung him, not
into n reply, but into silent and lonely
brooding on his wrongs.
"Ho himself describes the sense of
horror aud humiliation which enmo
over him when, in a fit of passion, she
called him 'a lame brat.' When Sir
"Walter Scott met him he said lie should
scarcely have noticed it. In fact, the
great novelist was ns lame ns the great
poet, only Byron's brilliant personality
made him, more than Scott, an object
of comment. His marriage was a fail
ure. It was a fortunate thing for lit
erature that his wife left him after
one year of matrimony.
"Had she remained with him his
genius might have perished uuder the
freezing influence of such a paragon
of propriety and dullness. William
Howitt tells us that Lady Byron, had
'frozen moments.'
"'I have seen her,' be says, 'come
down in the morning as if she had
lain all night on a glacier, frozen, as it
were, to1 the very soul, and no efforts
on the part of those urouud her could
restore her for the day to any genial
social warmth.' "
A Delicate, Tasteful Breakfast. .
Apropos of monotonous unimagiun
tlve breakfasts, Thomas Love Peacock
once drew up the menu for breakfast
"for a man of taste." "Coffee, tea.
cream, eggs, ham, tongue, cold fowl,"
he wrote, "all these are good nnd be
speak good knowledge in him who sets
them forth. But the touchstone H

and shrimps the second, potted char

SUNK
FIRE IN OPERA HOUSE
Only Employees in the Building at the
Time.
What might have led to a general
aIaro, fire was averted through the
exl;. sensitiveness of the smelling
appa ' Vowned and controlled by
Charles fy9v,ey, the efficient first as
sistant pro. f.nan at the opera
house.
While at his i "'f duty Thursday
morning, Mr. Huriv Quoted an un
usual odor permeating the atmos
phere. Being familiar with all the
odors that usually pertain to a first
class theatre, Charles was immediate
ly keen to discover from whence
came this peculiar smell, somewhat
akin to burning rags and stale rubber
boots. After convincing himself
there was a fire somewhere in the
building, caused by defective electric
wiring, aud being a staunch advocate
of the "safety first" propaganda, he
was about to turn in an alarm from
box 48 when acting upon the .sugges
tion of one of tho members of the
Jack Lynn stock company, playing in
the theatre last week, he thought he
would first ascertain whether the fire
was In the cellar or on the roof.
With pattering feet, chattering
teeth, and flustrated coat-tails, he
dashed down under the stage where
instinct led him to believe it most
likely a fire would begin its insid
ious and diabolical work. True
enough, as he approached the north
west corner of the cellar underneath
a pile of combustibles, the stench be
came horrible and the smoke more
dense. Turning on his heel, as he is
went to do when excited, our hero
fought his way up stairs.
In fact in i
this emergency he turned on both
heels, incidentally stepping on his
accelerator (pet corn) aud made tho
trip back to the stage in safety with
his nose folded over and a halo of
smoke about his head.
Before getting out into the open
air he was seized .with a burning
pain over the heart. Ready help was
by this time at hand and upon Inves
tigation it was found that Charles
had dropped a lighted pipe in his w
per left hand coat pocket and sym-.
pathetic combustion had taken place,
setting fire to his suspenders and
scorching the pin feathers on bis
ches;.
Mr, Hurley was put out (the back
door) by his associates and he now
averes that velvet tooacco inaite3 a
poor lining for a rood oat and has
already applied for a smokers acci

No casualties have been reported.
The raiders escaped.
A point of interest in the official
account of the first raid is .the. state
ment that it, was mado by an aero
plane. Jleretotbre, Germany has re
lied principally on Zeppelins for aerial
attacks on England. Of late, how
ever, there has been much discussion
in England of a new type of German
aeroplano, the Fokkor, which has
been said to excel tho aircrult of the
alliej.
English newspapers stated last
week that the British airmen were
outpowered and ouiengined. Harold

retary for war, replied to this criti
cism in the House of Commons, as
serting that the Fokker was well
adapted to defensive operations, but
was incapable of making long flights.

a lame donkey in that way?' 1
" l'.fVendi, It is the will of God'.'
" 'But you do not allow horses or
camels to be beaten thus.'
" 'Kfiemli. the donkey is not like
the horse, nor yet Is be like the camel. !
The reason in this: I.'pm u certain day
the donkeys went before Allah end
complained that they were grievously
beaten by men. so that life was a
greater bunion tluui .they could bear.
Then said Allah: "I cannot make men

you so thick a bide that, however

RUNNING THE - BLOCKADE.
It Was Successfully Done Ages Ago at
the Clege of Syracuse.
Blockading and blockade running is
not a young war measure by any
means. One of the earliest authentic
Instances of the practice dates back
two centuries before the Christiau era.
Marcus Claudius Marcollur,, command
ing u powerful Roman army nnd an
efficient licet, laid siege to Syracuse, a
rich City on the isle of Sicily. Car
thage, Home's great rival on tho north
shore of Africa, one of tho great sen
powers of that time, was not at all
pleased with the Idea of Home captur
ing Syracuse, a free city and pi'Wmbly
a source of great revenue through
trade with Carthage. -
Syracuse was a well fortified city,
and there seemed to be no immediate
prospect of Borne taking It by storm,
so Marccllus decided to starve Its In
habitants Into submission.- lie put a
cordon of ships across the entrance to
the harbor and arrayed his army on
the laud side so that no succor could
come from without. But he had under
estimated the boldnessof the Cartha
ginians. There was no question of
coulriibaud iu those days conditional
or other.
Iu their swift, oar driven galleys the
sailors of tho African city easily elud
ed the ships set lowatch the port nnd
carried provisions and war material
Into tile beleaguered city. So success
ful were the Carthaginians In getting
supplies Into the city running the
blockade that hud it not fallen through
treachery It would have been enabled
(o hold out indefinitely. While block
ades probably had been established be
fore on a small scale, the blockade of
Syracuse is one of the curliest in
stances where the elllcieucy of a block
ade by-sen was of vital importance in
determining tho success of war ou an
important seaport. Munsey's Maga

A CULINARY COMEDY.
One of the Trials of a Husband Vvhcse
Vife Can't Cook.
They were a newly married couple.
The wife, though a fair cook, did not
know bow to make the things his
mother had prepared. And this vexed
the husband, although ho was disposed
to be indulgent for the sake of har
mony. But there was one point upon
which ho sorrowed . not a little. Ills
wife could not muke edible corn bread,
and coin bred was the food upon
which he was reared.
One day a girlhood friend of the wife
visited her and, after assisting In the
preparation of luncheon, accepted an
invitation to stay aud eat it with the
newly weds. The husband arrived, nnd
the guest nnd he took their places at
the table while the wife went to the
kitchen to bring some forgotten dish.
Before his plate was the husband's
corn bread, but It was a miserable fail
ure, a sickly, yellow, flat und bcuvy.
He became confidential.
"There is one of the trials of a bus
band whose wife can't cook," ho said
apologetically to tho guest.' '"Just hnvG
a look at that corn bread. But you
mustn't let the wife know what I said,
for it would 'hurt her feelings." ,
When the wife entered the room, a
few moments later she noticed that a
deep blush suffused the guest's face. .
"Why, what is the matter, dear?" she
asked.
"It's nothing," the guest replied hur
riedly. . .
An hour later, after the husband bad
gone to the otllco. tho chorus of two
laughing women's voices merrily re
sounded through the household of tho
uewlywods.
But the wife has not yet told the
husband that her guest made the corn
bread on that day she stayed for lunch

THE FORTNIGHTLY
Pleasing
and Profitable
Program
' Given " Saturday.
The Fortnightly program ' of Satur
day afternoon was one of tho most
t pleasing of tho season and was enjoy-
ed by a good sized audience, consid
ering tho unfavorable) weather.
Mrs. Elizabeth Grinnell Van Pat
ten of Burlington, who made such a
favorable Impresslou last year in the
Peaco Propaganda program, was
heard in a lighter vein, reciting two
.shoit plays, "The Twelve Pound
Look" by James M. Barrie and "The
Open Door" by Alfred Sutro. She al
so contributed at the end an amusing
little farce of tho anti-suffrage variety
which left, everybody in good. humor..
.Both playa were given with infinite
understanding, no shade of meaning
being lost. . Mrs. Van Patten's art
enables her seemingly to think1 ' the
thoughts of her characters,'1 and she
portrays them with an ease which is
delightful. There Is no straining for
effect, no leading up to a elima, yet
there is always ah abundance of pow
er and the ability to apply it intui
tively at tho right moment..' She has
ail the gifts of the true artist and to
hear her once cr twice only Iu
creases the desire to hear her again.
Club members are already asking for
a return cngigement next year.
Tho program was opened with a
song by Miss Vera Suter, accompan
ied by Mrs. George W. Kceseman. She
sang Chamiuado's "Rosaraonde" In
French very sweetly and between tho
plays sang Bartlett's "Elaine," both
songs giving much pleasure.
At tho brief business session one
name was voted Into membership and
notice was given of the annual musi
cale on February 5, the program to
bo given by the Cadinan Concert com
riny of Boston.
