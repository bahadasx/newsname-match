BURDEN BEYOND
COMPARE IS LOT
OF THIS FAMILY
Grim Reaper Claims Two Children
in One Day and Third on Verge
of Death from Scarlet
Ferer.
LAST OF MANY AFFLICTIONS
First Had Smallpox, Then Spinal
Meningitis and Finally Tornado
Wrecks Their Home.
MOTHER SICK WITH LA GRIPPE
If there is a single family In
Omaha that believes It has been un
duly visited by death, sickness, or
trouble of any sort, let Us members
read of George C. Medlock and his
household, and be thankful they
have escaped such a burden as has
been this family's lot.
George C. Medlock, aged 29 years.
1 a roofer by trade, and with his
wife lives at 2831 Decatur street.
He had five children Sunday morn
ing. Two died during the day, one
was buried Sunday afternoon and a
third Is not expected to live twenty
four hours.
Scarlet fever took Clarence, aged
2 years, at 7:30 Sundays morning,
and early in the afternoon he was
buried. When the father returned
from Forest Lawn cemetery he was
met at the door by the undertaker
and his assistants, taking the body
of Eveline, aged 7 years, who died
of the same diRease at 2:30. Agnes,
aged 5 years. Is not expected to live,
and the mother, Anna Medlock, aged
27 years, is seriously 111 with the
grip.
George, asred years, was stricken with
tho fever two weeks afro and recovered
In a few days, but was followed by Eve
line, Clarence and Agnes In turn. There
Is a fifth child, Henry, aged S months,
who until Sunday afternoon had shown
no symptoms of the disease. Eveline will
be buried this morning; at 9:90 by the side
of her little brother.
' First IId -Smallpox. '
Shortly before the tornado of ISIS the
entire Medlock family, consisting of the
father, mother and four children, were
taken with the smallpox, the father be
In? confined In the emerg-enoy hospital.
They bad scarcely recovered, from this
when Oeorge and Eveline were down
again, Wis time with' spinal rrmninjrltts.
Which left each a cripple for life. After
this cruel blow had been met. the tornado
came, and the little home, on which the
Medlocka were making the final pay
ments, was rased to the ground, destroy
ing practically every article that they
owned. The mother at this time was In
a delicate condition, and the father sus
tained two fractured rlb and deep and
painful wounds about the head and upper
part of the body when their heme was
tumbled about them by the wind.
Last spring the entire family ' had
diphtheria. : .'
lireadrvlnaer Qamrawtiaed.
Although Medio is a good workman,
be has been enable to do anything of
late because of being quarantined. It
was by special permit of the health de
partment that he was allowed to attend
the funeral, and this after fresh clothing,
sterilised and fumigated, was brought
him from outside the house and every
precaution taken to nullify any chance of
Ills spreading the disease.
"That man has been up night and day
with his family since they have been
ill," remarked a neighbor Sunday after
noon. "He has given them all their medi
cine, tended to their every want, and It
Is a miracle that he hasn't given com
pletely out with this terrible affliction.
Nrlahbora Help Out.
"We neighbors have tried to do what
we could for them, and If I didn't have
a baby of my own, I'd go in that house
and be quarantined, too." said Mrs. W,
D. Clark, IS9 Decatur street.
"With groceries, medicine, medical at
tention and the hundred -and-one other
expenses which go to maintain a home,
the Medlocka have been having a hard
row to hoe, especially with no money
coming in." ,
When tho father returned from the
funeral of his little boy, to find a second
dead child being taken from the- house,
he said: "I can't grieve any more, some
thing snapped inside of me when Clary
went. My God! Oh, my God!"

LARGE 'SUMS OF MONEY RAISED
Subscribers to the Associated Jew
ish Charities who fall to make good
may find their Identity made public.
At the meeting at the ' Swedish
Auditorium Sunday afternoon, Rabbi
Frederick Cohu, Harry B. Zlmman,
Xstdor Ziegler, and others expressed
themselves in favor of such publicity.
Rabbi Cohn started the agitation
after all the reports for the splendid
year's work had been read and ap
proved. When called upon by Presi
dent Samuel Ilavits. Dr. Cohn de
clared that while the work bad been
splendid and while much good work
had been done, there were neverthe
less some who had subscribed reason
able sums and had then fallen down
woefully In meeting the obligations.
War as a Exesit,
"I realise," he said, "that the war in
Europe had mads heavier drains upon all
as our people are assisting- in the Jewish
relief work abroad, but I fear some have
been usintT this European relief work
merely as an excuse for refusing- us the
money in the work at home,
"I am surprised to find that there are
many of our people who are very well
to do who nevertheless are. giving miser
able petty, paltry sums toward this Jew
ish charity. I believe these, who are so
well able to slve, and who have promised
and have fallen down In the making- gooi
of their- promise should be publicly de

Harry B. Zlmman, vice president of the
association, declared be would be In favor
of making the names public. "Another
thing," be said, "those who have not
worked In the collection of these sub
scriptions do not realise tbe work the
committee has to do every year. There

Recommend Better
Fire Alarm System
In a report of the committee on fire
prevention to members of the National
Board of Fire Underwriters, dated at
New York, January 19, the following
recommendations were made as applylngi
to Omaha: "An adequate and up-to-date
tire alarm telegraph system as first In
Importance, remedy the decidedly de
ficient chemical service of the fire depart
ment, provide additional pumping capac
ity for the- high service and relnfercing
mains In the closely built portions of the
city where tbe water works distribution
system la weak."
The city council has received bids for
combination motor-propelled hose and
chemical trucks. Commissioner Withneli
and Chief Salter will visit several cities
this week to observe several machines
In operation. Approximately t&5,000 will be
spent this spring for motor apparatus.
Ten thousand feet of hose were pur
chased last week.
The fire alarm system referred to In
the underwriters' report waa discussed
st length before the city council during
December, when the council decided to
buy hose and apparatus this year and
consider the alarm system next year.
According to the report, 97 per cent of
nil fire alarms In Omaha during 1914 and
m5 were sent In over the telephone system.

ARMS QUESTION
IN FRONT RANK
President's Determination to Appeal
to Country Restores Issue
in Congress, v" -
TO BOLSTER UP WEAK MEMBERS
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21 Presi
dent Wilson's determination to talk
to the people of the middle west on
national preparedness has had the
effect of restoring that Issue as the
uppermost subject of Interest, and
discussion in congress.
rorseveral weeks preparedness
has been overshadowed by the Mexi
can problem and International ques
tions growing out of the Europeon
war. Now, however, with the presi
dent about to turn to the country to
arouse the public to military re
quirements of the nation administra
tion and opposition leaders realise
that lively times are ahead on Capi
tol hill.
Democratic leaders thoroughly In sym
pathy with the president's views on pre
paredesa area gratified ever the purpose
of the chief executive to take the field.
Inasmuch as there has been apparent In
congress for some time a tendency to
adopt a waiting policy among many
members uncertain regarding the views
of their constituents on the subject.
The president's tour, it Is believed will
serve the double purpose of bringing- out
publlo opinion and stirring up members
of congress.
Chance for Reply.
On the other hand opponents of prepar
edness see In the president's trip an op
portunity to further their cause by reply
ing to his arguments in the senate and
house.
Uneasiness over the Mexican situation
which stirred congress for more than a
week has greatly abated "and probably
will not be revived soon unless notable
developments should occur In Mexico.
Administration leaders regard the danger
of being forced into difficulties with Car
ran ia averted for the present and even
republicans of the senate have concluded
not to force the Issue of Intervention to a
vote at this time.
Senator Borah, one of the foremost be
lievers In the. necessity of military ac
tion In Mexico by the United States, has
decided that there la nothing to be done
at this time. When the senate foreign
relations committee declined to act on
Intervention resolutions last week, Senator

at Juares. The body of Akers was
interred here late today.
The bodies of both Mexicans were
hurled immediately, but that of
Bernardo, who confessed to having
fired tho shots that killed Akers, was
exhumed to satisfy a doubt concern
ing the identity of the slayer.
Douglas Downs, another American, who
was with Akers seeking stolen cows, and
who escaped the bullets of the Mexicans,
declared last nlgbt after seeing Bernardo
Duran that the prisoner waa not the man.
Downs was at the Juares cemetery when
the face of the executed man waa exposed
late today and then admitted that he
bad been mistaken. American officials
were with Downs, and their certification
that the slayer had been duly executed

had produced the plan already made pub

in tne same time.

take two years of five hours Intensive

GERMANS MAKE
MORE AIR RAIDS
UPON ENGLAND
New Type of Aeroplane Used in Two
Attacks on Southernmost Part
of the British Coast Near
London.
ONE KILLED, SEVERAL INJURED
Teutons Take Advantage of Bright
Moonlight to Resume Chan
nel Flights.
FIRES STARTED THROUGH B0MB3
LONDON, Jan. 23. Two hostile
aeroplane attacks were made on
the ent eaKst coast today. In tbe
first, made early this morning b-r a
single aeroplane, nine bombs wero.
aroppea killing; one person and In
juring several. The second attack
early this afternoon was made by
two aeroplanes. No casualties were
reported in this attack. The raiders
escaped.
An official account of the first
raid follows:
"The war office announces that,
taking advantage of the bright
noonllght a hostile aeroplane vis
ited the east coast of enKt at 1
o'clock this morning. After dropping
nine bombs In rapid succession it
made of seaward.
"No naval or mllitarv ilinu .

'The following casualties nnr.urrA- rt.

three children slightly Injured."
The war office announcement concern
ing the second attack says:
"following the aerial attack en the
east coast of Kent early this morning
two hostile aeroplanes made a second at-
iacK upon the same locality shortly after
noon.
"After coming under a heavy fire the
raiders disappeared, eursued hv our tmvi
and military machines.
, "ine enemy effected no damage snd
no casualties have been reported."
Maid Near Leattoa, .
The county of Kent forms the southern-
the Thames. It Includes nart nf th -i...
of London, but the wording of the of-
uciai statement Indicates that the aero
plane did not reach the city. The point
nearest London on tha RMtim .
Kent la some fifty miles from the center
of the city.
; A point of Interest In the official ac
count of the raid Is the statement that
It was made by an aeroplane. Hereto,
fore Germany has relied principally on
Zeppelins for aerial attacks on England.
Of late there has been much discussion
In England of a new type of German
aeroplane, the Fokker. which has been
said to eicel the aircraft of the entente
alllos. England's newspapers stated last
week that tbe British air machines were
outpowered and out-englned. - - -Merits
ef New Airship.
Harold J. Tennant, parliamentary un
der secretary for war, replied to this
criticism in the house of commons, as
serting that the Fokker was well adapted
to defensive operations, but was Incapable
of making long flights.
Borne of the London newspapers were
not satisfied with this statement, point
ing out that British headquarters' reports
showed the loss of sixteen aeroplanes lit
a month. , It was suggested that Fokker
aeroplanes would accompany Zeppelins
when the nest raid ever England was
nosantpttoa of Attnoka.
The raids come after an Interval of
several months, during which England,
so far as has been reported officially,
was immune from such attacks. The last
previous occurrence of this nature was
on October IS, when fifty-five person i
were killed and 114 wounded by a Zeppe
lin attack on London. ' It has been re
ported by returning travelers, however,
that the Germans have made many at
tempts since tnat lima at aerial attacks,
but that their alrcrafs were turned back
by Brilsh aeroplanes.
Conscription in j
Canada Unlikely,
Declares Dalbey
"Although conscription in Canada prob
ably will not be resorted to, a majority
of Canadian families are fsst becoming
represented In the British military
forces." said II. B. Dalbey of Torktown,
Saskatchewan, Canada, last night at
Hotel Fontenelle.
Its Is an American cltlsen, but has
lived In Canada five years, and Is now
on his way back to his name city there.
He discounted stories of approaching
conscription and the possibility of young
men being recruited In the Canadian
army against their desire.
. ' Especially tn wettem Canada the
number of enlistments for military serv
ice Is very large and Increasing fast," he
said. "Compulsion his not been neces
sary to get recruits, as thosands of able
bodied single men are volunteering, and
many have already sacrificed Ufa or
limbs for the Dominion
''Stories of Canadians fleeing from the
provinces to the states are largely ficti
tious, I believe, except In a compara
tively few cases of young American
homesteaders who bave not yet acquired
the. British patriotism of the regular Ca
nadians." COUPLE MEETS DEATH
