TURKEY MAYTAKE
BLAME IN SINKING
OF LINER PERSIA
Washington, Jan.. 24. Unofficial dis
patches from abroad indicating that
Turkey might acknowledge that one of
her submarines sunk the British liner
Persia promise to revive the diplo
matic features of that disaster.
Statfe department officials had no
dispatches on the subject today from
Ambassador Morgenthau. Neither had
they received any official word from
Ambassador Penfield at Vienna trans
mitting Austria's official disavowal of
any connection with the disaster, re
ported unofficially last week.
Until the intimation came that Tur
key might assume responsibility it was
generally assumed in official quarters
that the cause of the sinking of the
liner would be numbered among the
mysteries ot the war.
There is no indication of what turn
the case will take in the light of the
latest information. None of the Teu
tonic allies except Germany and Aus
tria has been included in the Ameri

It was indicated today that any In
