The Juarex cemetery is a mile and a

T?RKEY ADMITS
SINKING PERSIA,
SAYS A REPORT
Ottoman Submarine Torpe
doed P. & 0. Liner, Accord
ing to Unofficial Statement.
MAY DEMAND DISAVOWAL
United States Probably Will
Send Sharp Note to
Constantinople.
REPORT IS FROM AMSTERDAM
State Department Without Confirma
tion?Government Has No Proof
that Ship Was Victim of Sub.
Turkey, according to an unofficial re
port which reached here last night from
Amsterdam, has admitted that a Turkish
submarine was responsible for the sink
ing of the Peninsula and Oriental liner
j Persia, in the Mediterranean last month.
Although officials of the State Depart
ment and members of the Turkish and
Teutonic embassy staffs were without
any conflrmatfon of the report, it created
a profound sensation.
Should it prove to be correct, it was?
stated, the United States government
will undoubtedly send to the Ottoman
government one of the sharpest notes
dispatched from Washington to a foreign
power since the Kuropean war began.
In the opinion of many persons, It would
be to all Intents and purposes an ultama
tum, demanding of Turkey, under threat
of an immediate severance of diplomatic
relations, a prompt disavowal, punish
ment of the commander responsible,
reparation and assurances for the fu
ture.
The sink in c of the Persia, coming or?
the heels of the destruction of the Italian
liner Ancona, aroused widespread indig
nation in American government circles,
for among the victims of the tragedy
were Robert N. McNeely, a newly ap
pointed l'nited States consul, en route
for his post at Aden, aod an Ameriran
missionary.
Report InpiMafi
The report from Amsterdam^ is particu
larly surprising In view of the fact that,
up to the present time, the l'nited Statea
has been without a shred of evidence to
prove that the Persia was attacked by a
submarine, ami for that reason the Amer
ican government, though chafing under Its
helplessness, had practically resigned
itself to the prospect that the t ragedy
would go down into history as one of the
mysteries of the war.
From the affidavits in possession of the
State Department, there was nothing to
show whether the liner was attacked by a
submarine, struck a mine, or blew up
from an internal explosion?nothing but
the Indefinite statement of Second Officer
Bromley that he had seen the wake of a
torpedo. There is nothing in the evidence,
definite or indefinite, to show that any
one on the ill-fated steamer saw a sub
marine, much less to Indicate its nation
ality.
It for the very reason that none on
board saw a submarine that the United
States. If Turkey admits responsibility,
will go the limit In pressing for imme
diate satisfaction: for, as officials Indi
cated last night. If no submarine were
visible, obviously the commander attack
ed without slightest warning and in defi
ance of every principle of International
law.

I??ndon, Jan. 8.?The movement for
peace has gathered more headway In
Hungary than anywhere else In Europe.
This fact, rumored for some time, has
been confirmed by a prominent American
business man who has Just reached here
from Budapest, where he spent ?tour
months, and met many of the leaders
of the Hungarian Parliament.
I'nlike the recent peace agitation in the
Reichstag, of which the outside world
obtained more or less accurate rarttcu
lars. a demand for peace made in the
Hungarian Parliament at the opening of
the a*-sHlon was suppressed by the lm
perlai censors. No accounts of what took
place were published In the local press,
and all dispatches destined for Vienna
and abroad which dealt with the situa
tion were destroyed.
And yet the Hungarian peace discu%
sion was of much more Importance than
the one In Berlin, because it was not !
socialistic In character. Count Michael j
Karolyl, leader of the Hungarian Inde
pendence party, demanded In the house,
amid the cheers of his one hundred end j
twenty-five followers, that the govern
ment msk.' peace or get out. "We have
given proof of our physical equrage; now

Sweden May Enter War With
. Teutons, Senator Fall Hears
Advices Say Scandinavian Nation May Declare War on
Russia and Great Britain Within One Week.
Norway and Denmark May Follow.
?Sweden may join the list of smaller
nations fighting on the side of the cen
tral empires within a week, according
to information which reached Senator'
Fall, of New Mexico, last night through
Private sources.
Declaration of war will be made upon
Great Britain and on Russia. Senator
Kail's advices state. Actual hostilities.
It Is understood, will be begun with an
attack on Russia through Finland.
"The real cause of Sweden's declaring
war." explained Senator Fall, "will be
found to He in the r? ideated efforts of
Great Britain to force Sweden to do this
very thing. However, great bittern esu
against Russia may be in Sweden, re
cent developments ln the British block
ade of Sweden have aroused the Swedes
to an even more bitter hostility against
England. From the outbreak of the war
Sweden has been favorable to Germany
and has done everything In her power
to aid Germany.
"With war existing between the two
countries. Great Britain could announce
and mnke effective a blockade of Sweden
which would in effect close the Baltic
and make it an inland sea. The Skager
Rack is territorial a aters, being less
than six miles in width. Danish territory
extends out from shore three miles on
one side and Swedish territory for three
miles on the other. An English blockade
of Sweden would thus automatically seal
the entrance to the Baiti??.
"My information that war is imminent
comes from a reliable source, ?nd all the
facts seem to make it more than proba
ble."
Copenhagen, Jan. 23.?A conference of
the foreign ministers of all the Scandi
navian countries is to be held ht Stock
holm In February, according to the Ber
liner Tageblatt.
The conference is called to lisct-ss the
new blockade measures expected soon to
l>e taken by Great Britain and allies. It
will deal as well with the increasingly
vexatious manner of enforcement of the
British orders-in-councit.
Thia conference is a sequel to the con
clave of the three Scandinavian kings
held earlier in the war at Melmoe, Sweden.
It is believed that events, recent and
prospective, now make it necessary for
the Scandinavian kingdoms to protect
their neutral rights.

Dr. C Franklin Mohr? What is to j

This is probably no news to you, ina?
