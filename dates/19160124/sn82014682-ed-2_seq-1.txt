From Trip of Inspection to

Cover Havoc Wrought By
Storm
ROAR OF WATER GAVE
v WARNING TO PEOPLE
Three Hundred and Thirty Per
sons in Need and 34 Fam
ilies Homeless, Are Official
Figures Given Out By Relief
Committee
That a total of , $50,000 will cover
the damages sustained by wailuku
plantation Is the belief of George II.
Robertson, vice-Dresident and manager
of C. Brewer & Company, who return
ed this m orninc from a short trip to
Maul, having gone over the scene of
the flood devastation of last week.
! There Is not so much damage as
we thought there might be," said Mr.
Robertson. "Much of the damage la
what mights be alled 'Invisible , of
course, and will be seen as time goes
on. However, I believe that 50,0o0
will cover everything.' . ' -j '
" About a dozen laborers' cottages
on the Wailuku plantation were wiped
out by the water, and . six or seven
acres of cane ' down in the stream
bed were completely swept away."
Mr. Robsrtaon says that the topog
raphy the river has been, changed
greatly by the flood, filling in here and
digging1 out-therc. with new channels
. cut in many places. -
Wailuku Not Unt?f VVaUrl.
" He says thaf Wfcluku was not . un
der four feet of water as was printed
elsewhere, and that Wailuku people
felt this was an unjust description of
their little village. The water did Its
damage down la ' the stream bed
proper, v V ' ' C" ''.'.

tie 'condition ? of ' Ihe" governmenft

their- iacase iru very severe, thle
condition lasting for mile upon mile.
Culverts and bridges wer victims of
the flood in many places."
' . Letters received at Alexander, &
Baldwin's today confirm the estimates
of losses printed In the Star-Bulletin
last Thursday, and putting the figures
somewhere between 1100,000 and $200,
000, for the Hawaiian Commercial
plantation. . . . 'v

.'j WAILUKU, Jan. 22. Conflicting re
ports and' opinions as to the number"
missing- are still prevalent In Wailuku
this morning. The coroner's Jury did
not hold a session before 10:30. ex
pecting that the , searching parties
working along the stream might find
the elght-yearold daughter ' of Mrs.
SodetanL . The girl Is still missing,
and in spite of the most diligent
search no trace of her has so far been
found.
Twelve" bodies have been reviewed
by the Jury. Members of that Jury
have expressed the opinion that ser
era! bodies are yet to be discovered.
Many of those who lost relatives and
friends are of the same opinion, and
the most careful search In all con
ceivable places is being kept up. The
calm sea of yesterday and today may
give up some of the dead at any mo
ment, for the torrent of raging water
was sufficiently strong even up to last
evening to carry away children, and
the stream Is still wide In many
places. It would not be at all strange
if the missing should yet be found to
be dead and caught somewhere in the
stream or had been waahed out to sea.
Were Warned by Roar.
;It is the unanimous opinion of all
the rescue parties and the police de
partment of Maul that had the cloud
burst occurred an hour earlier on
Tuesday morning that the toll of the
dead would be four or five times what
it is today. By half past 4 or 5 when
the river began to swell, many of the
families were stirring, about, and by
the terrible roar were sufficiently
warned to 'get out of reach of the
flood.
. The Spanish homes In Iao Valley
were washed away by the river cut
ting a new channel toward the Wale
Jiu side of the gorge. Trees and
stones seemed to more or less ob
struct the .natural bed, and conse
quently the violence of the water at
this point can easily be understood.
Here the loss of life waa the worst in
a small number of families. The river
took a similar turn Just above the
Waihee bridge. The pile of stones
that had been brought downstream by
the rush of the water gathered in a
mass filling the usual bed or the river.
The water was again diverted toward
Waihee. and came pounding down up
on the houses between the bridge and
the taro patches.

across the highway. Other houses on

hundred men are now employed in
clearing the tracks and the vicinity
of the spot where a Great Northern
passenger train was wrecked by an
avalanche last Saturday.
It is expected that It will take a
long time to find, the missing passen
gers, owing to the depth of the snow
into which they were hurled when the
coaches were swept from the track.
A fall of 25 degrees in temperature
has turned the rain into snow , and
averted floods in the entire lower Pu

SAN FRANCISCO, CaK, Jan. 24.
Travel by land and sea is disorganized
because of the storms that are sweep
ing the Pacific and western third of
the United States. Rain, snow and
gales in western United States ' and
the heavy winds off the coast have
caused railroads and steamship lines
to modify or abandon their schedules.
The steamer Admiral Schley, report
ed off Coos Bay, Is now believed to be
safe, late wireless reports indicating
that she can live through tho gale.
The steamer Centralis, also reported
in distress, is likewise thought to be
in no danger' of foundering, though
she may be crippled and has lost her
deckload.
The North Pacific coast las: night
