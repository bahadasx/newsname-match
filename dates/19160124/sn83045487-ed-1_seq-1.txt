GASOLINE COST TO CONSUMER
Per Gallon

Chicago 16.5 to 17.5 19 to 21
Boston 23 25
Philadelphia 19 21
Pittsburgh 19t!o23 20 to 24
Indianapolis 17.5 21 to 22
Kansas City ...14.8 to 15.8 18 to 20
St Louis 15 to 16.9 17 to 21
Buffalo 21 23
Trenton 21 23 to 24

Kansas City, wholesale, seems to in

fixing.
