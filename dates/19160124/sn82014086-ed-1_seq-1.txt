INTERPRETATION OF CLAUSE
OF UNDERWOOD TARIFF LAW
Government's Brief in Fourteen Cases
Will Be Filed Today.
Washington, Jan. 23.: The govern
ment's brief in fourteen cases involv
ing the interpretation of the clause
of the Underwood tariff law giving a
discount of five per cent, in customs
duties on goods imported in Amer
ican ships will be filed in the supreme
court tomorrow by Solicitor General
Davis. "Involved in the cases, which
the government contends should be
dismissed, are claims estimated by
customs authorities at New Tork to
amount to $28,000,000 as well as the
question of whether granting such a
discount to goods imported only in
American ships would - violate the
terms of more than twenty commer
cial treaties with some of the lead
ing nations of the world.
During the past two years the cases
have been passed upon by the board
of general appraisers at New York by
the court of customs appeals and' by
officials of the administration charged
with the enforcement of tariff laws.
There has not been a complete agree
ment in the interpretations of any of
these authorities. The court of cus
toms appeals, from which the cases
reached the supreme court, held that
the five per cent, discount should be
allowed not only on its imports In
American-owned or registered ships,
but also on goods brought in the ves
sels' of all natiens with which the
United States has commercial treaties.
TROOPS KEPT IN IGNORANCE
OF GALLIPOL1 WITHDRAWAL
Until Christmas Day" They Thought
s They Were to .Remain All Winter.
London, Jan. 23, 10.25 p. m. A cor
respondent of Reuter's Telegram com
pany describing the withdrawal from
Gallipoli, says that up until Christmas
day the troops were ignorant of
whether they were to remain for the
winter or to be withdrawn.
"In fact,"' says the- correspondent,
"The French had made elaborate
preparations to pass the winter on
the peninsula. On Christmas day it
became known, however, that the
French - were ' leaving and that ' the
British would take over their sector
and many weeks' supplies and provi
sions which they had already landed.
"""Orders for the evacuation came to
the British only on December 29. The
Turks, evidently - aware of the pos
sible contingency- of evacuation, had
kept up a most persistent air recon
naissance, flying much lower than us
ual and obstinately refusing to be
driven away by run fire, Ever since
the 20th. howeover, the evacuation of
the northern front had enabled the
lurw -to tiding up a number of fresh
guns from their positions there and
they had doubled or trebled their supply-
of ammunition iaad every padt of
the British ground was open to their
fire." ..

Washington,! Jan. 23. Creation of a
tariff commission, it was learned from
official sources tonight, has been de
termined upon by the Wilson adminis
tration. A bill providing for such a
commission will be introduced in con

Wilson .may discuss the subject in a
message to congress.
The duties of the proposed commis
sion or board under the plan under
stood to have been agreed upon by ad
ministration leaders would be to col
lect information regarding the tariff
and to co-ordinate similar powers now
believed by President Wilson to be held
by existing government bodies.

always should be treated in scientific
fashion, the president has given con
sideration to the situation which will
follow the European war, and has been
urged by many of his advisors that
legislation will be necessary to safe
guard American industrial and com
mercial interests when that time
comes.
