which is soon to decide whether Mrs.
Kltzabcth Mohr is guilty of tho mur

tho divorce action whloh sho brought
against Dr. Mohr. Mr. lllco stated
frankly to the Court that tho con
tents of tho papers would show mo-
tlvo and fought to havo them ac
cepted as part of tho record.
Mrs. Mohr's attorney, John J. Fitz
gerald, not only had 'tho papers ex
cluded but by n skilful movo got be
fore tho Jury only that part which
was of benefit to his client. This was
that Mrs. Mohr charged her hus
band with being uddleted to the liso
ot chloral and morphine, that ho
treated her brutally and was an
habitual drunkard and that sho
prayed for tho custody of her chil
dren and relief until a reconciliation
could be effected.
Mr. Itlco appeared beforo tho couft
.with several greut sheaves of papers
which ho spread beforo tho Jury after
they had been ldcntillcd by tho as
sistant clerk of tho court. When ho
began to tell tho Jury what they wero
Mr. Fltzgorald arose with his pre
liminary objection.
He told Judgii Stearns that h had
no Idea what was In all thoho papers,
and that If Mr. Hlco wanted to got

word of them to tho Jury. This was
not at all to Mr. Rico's liking, but

State Comptroller liugenc Travis, who is In New York, was notified
to-day that a voucher purporting to cover the expenses of Gov. Whit
man's trip to the San Francisco Exposition had been delivered to his'
office in Albany this morning. x
His deputies in Albany informed him by telephone that there was
no itemization of expenses, but that EVERYTHING HAD BEEN
LUMPED INTO A SINGLE CHARGE OP A LITTLE MORE THAN
,?20,000.
The Comptroller immediately ordered that the voucher be rejected
and sent back to the State Exposition Commission for correction, so
that it would show the exepenses in detail and for each person.
"My deputies inform me," said Comptroller Travis to The Evening
World, "that they received this morning from the exposition commission,
a large bundle of documents, which on the surface appeared to be routine
reports of commission expenses, salaries of employees, &c In the
midst of the bundle they came across a bill containing a single item of
expenses for the Governor's trip. (
"As reported to me over tne telephone the item was a lump sum.
charge for 'transportation to San Francisco and return for thirty-nine'
people, five Pullman cars, dining car meals and restaurant charges, &c.,'
making a total of S20.760.46.
"THERE WAS NO SEPARATION OF ITEMS, NO DETAILS
OF ANY KIND, NO NAMES, NOR EVEN ANY PRO-RATING.
EVERYTHING WAS MADE AN INCLUSIVE CHARGE.
"The bill appeared to have been certified to in July, 1915, and was
iiKirked as paid by the commission in December. The rules of the"
Comptroller's office do not permit acceptance of such bills and I have
ordered it rejected.
"Full details of the account will be made public this afternoon in '
Albany."
