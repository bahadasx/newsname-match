have been penetrating, himself an
nounced that for a. time the situation

Villa, Well Altcuil.
Villa was located today with soino
degree of deflnllcness, If weight of
evidence counts In pinning down him
rapid shifts. From several source
constitutionalists, received message
all of which plated him in approxi
mately tho same portion of western
Chihuahua. These difip.Uehes had
him nearly dun south Of the Ameri
can column's present known position
and close to the Sierra Turuhumaru)
mountains, so close to them In fact,
that if his reputation us a fox holds
good during the American chase, ho
should be able to make a puz.ling;
disappearance in these ranges with
a very few hours riding. By all He
counts he is more than 100 miles
ahead of the Americans, about tho
saino illstance ho has been out of
their reach for u week but with on
possibly Important, difference, that
while heretofori the Americans have
been tiding on a. somewhat cold trail,
they arc now ncurlnfr ground which
Villa very recently piu-acd over and
where they may have practical op
portunity to test out the temper of
the rural Mexicans, from whom they
might receive valuable information.
No Intention (if l ighting.
The story that Villa in gathering
men and preparing' to n-slit was re
vived In constitutionalist news sources
today, and he was even said to havn
ten million rounds of cartridges and
shells, many of home manufacture, se
creted in the mountains where ho was
expected to make a stand. Doubt that
Villa would do any such tbingr was ex
prcMt.ed, how over, by Andrea. Garcia,
the Mexican consul here, who claimed
that Villa Intends to make, thft Ameri
can expeditionary force it joke. Mr.
Garcia declared he was convinced that
tlie bandit had no Intention of fighting
Americans.
"line of my men," he said, "who re
turned trom the Calcutta dUtrict to
day, brought me positive Information
that Villa was disbanding his men,
and intended to hide In the moun
tains with three or four of his trusted
followers and defy the Americana to
find him. An army might wander in
that region for years and never find
a man like Villa, who knows every
foot of the ground.
Would Make FxHdltlt lUtilculous.

to play hide and seek with thn Amer
