Pittam Holds L.ead on Rod-
key, Giving Tigers the
Victory, 45 to 40.
MEW RECORDS MADE
Simpson Sets a World's Mark
and Incidentally An
nexes 15 Points.
Radford Pittam of Missouri, with
the "Tiger. Tiger" and "Rock Chalk,
jay Hawk" of .",000 enthusiastic root
ers ringing in his ears, dashed across
tbe finish line one foot ahead of Fied
Rodkey of Kansas in the final lap of
the relay and won the thirteenth an
nual indoor track meet of the two
schools, 45 to 40. Friday night in
Convention Hall, Kansas City.
When the two relay teams lined up
for the final cent, the score stood a
draw, 40 to 40. With the exception of
the 50-yard dash and the quarter-mile,
the meet had run true to predictions.
In the dash, Kansas got an unexpect
ed second and Missouri did the same
thing in the quarter. The "dope art
ists" had been vindicated and the final
result depended on the relay.
Kansas (.'ains in First Lap.
Elliott. Kansas, won the rim of the
track and lined up with Lucian Eaton
for the first lap. At the crack of the
gun, Eaton tried for the pole. His
effort proved disastrous, for he fail
ed and lost nearly ten yards. This
was the lead Elliott turned over to
"Humpty" Campbell, his teammate. It
looked easy for the Jayhawkers then,
but they had not reckoned on Gentry
Daggy. Ten yards is a big lead, but
Daggy gradually shortened the marg
in, until Grant Wyatt was able to start
on the third lap scarcely two yards be
hind O'I.eary, the Kansas runner.
Here, for the first time, Missouri's'
prospects looked faorable. Wyatt
literally leaped to the front and w-on
the pole. It was the first time a Tiger
runner had had the favorable posi
tion. O'Leary ran a great race, but
Wyatt proved just a little better and
turned over a three-yard lead to Pit
tam. Few thought that Pittam would be
able to hold the lead. It seemed a
sure bet that Kodkey would have no
trouble in gaining three yards, for
Rodkey is one of the greatest quarter
, milers ever developed at Kansas and
it was Pittam's first big race,
iroilkcy Gains m Pittam.
Realizing that on this race depend
ed the meet, each man was putting
forth every effort. Gradually Rodkey
lessened the distance between them,
until scarce a foot remained. Hut Hod
key had run his best. He was unable
to gain in the last few yards and when
the tape was reached he was still be
hind Missouri had won the relay
Md the meet.
In the first event, the ."0-yard dash,
Kansas sprang a surprise when David
son finished second. Had Renick
nished second in this event, as the
was expected to do, Missouri would
not have needed the relay. On the
other hand, had Kansas captured
the quarter, as the "dopesters" had
predicted, the meet would have gone
to the Jayhawkers without the re
lay. These two upsets balanced eacli
other and were the only surprises of
the meet
Simpson Sffs World's ICeconl.
Warren, who won the shot-put for
Missouri in the K. C. A. C. meet, was
unable to repeat, finishing second to
Reber, and Kansas took every place
in the mile, giving Kansas the lead,
15 to S at the end of ttese three
events. Rob Simpson and Renick

record for the dual meets, when they

By United Fre.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., .March 18. The
San Diego Exposition now in its sec
ond year, was rechristened at noon
today "The Panama-California Inter
national Exposition an Exposition of
Peace."
While San Diego made holiday and
thousands thronged the grounds of
the palm-irded show city. President
Davidson's toast to the exposition and
to peace was repeated in the principal
cities of the United States and Cana
da. Nineteen nations, United States
possessions, western and California
counties are represented in the ex
position. NOTES OF THE
The officials of the meet are well
known in Missouri Valley athletic cir
cles. J. C. Grover, who has handled
more than one Tiger football game,
was starter of the meet. Dr. J. A.
Reilly of the K. C. A. C. was referee,
while the clerk of the course was
none other than E. C. Qulgley, Na
tional League umpire, known to Tiger
fans as a football and basketball ref
eree. The Convention Hall track is six
laps to the half-mile, twelve to the
mile.
The best time ever recorded for a
relay team winner in the dual meet
was made by the Tiger quartet of
1912, when the mile was negotiated in
3 minutes 34 seconds. That was one
of the years when the great Bermond
went out and overtook a Jayhawker
who was far ahead.
Missouri won the meet last year, 44
to 41, the relay deciding the meet. In
1914, the victory was easier for the
Tigers, Missouri winning without the
relay. However, the Tigers captured
the final event to run up the total.
The year before 1913 was the only-
time the Kansans won the meet. They
finished with a one-point lead, 43 to
42.
The Kansas supporteis were the
first to make the big noise. The
Jayhawker band, gathered in the south
side of Convention Hall, sounded its
first strains early in the evening. Im
mediately afterward the Kansas root
ers, on the west side of the hall,
opened up with the justly famous
"Rock Chalk, Jayhawk." A little later
the Missouri band which, by the
way was hired In Kansas City an
swered the challenge with "Hang that
Jayhawk to a Sour Apple Tree."
The meet was scheduled to begin
at 8:15 o'clock, but it was after 8:30
before the gun was fired for the 50-
yard dash, the opening event of the
evening.

time to spare, the band blared forth
with "Dixie" and the Missouri root
ers came to life.
Nearly 5,000 persons attended the
meet this year. Barely "4,000 were
present at last year's contest.
It looked gloomy for Schulte and
his gang after three events, the 50
yard dash, the shot-put and the mile,
had been finished. Kansas was In the
lead, 16 to S.
After Missouri had evened the
score, 16 to 16, by taking both places
in the high hurdles, the first upset
of the meet occurred when the boys
from Tigertown tallied eight points
in the quarter-mile. -Daggy and Wyatt
ran a dead heat, breaking the meet
record, made in 1908 by Shannon
Douglass of Missouri, who ran the 440
in 52 4-5 seconds.
Kansas supporters saw a man to
fear in next year's meet when Don
Selbie, Missouri freshman, had no
trouble in winning the special 440-yard
run in 52 4-5 seconds.
Another dual meet record was brok
en and the score tied when Rodkey
of Kansas finished first in the half
mile, with his teammate, Fiske, second.
Rodkey made the distance in 1:58
4-5, smashing Bermond's record of
2:02 2-5, made In 1911.
It was a great night for the smash
ing of records. A world's mark was
broken in the 50-yard low hurdles
when Simpson finished in 5 4-5 sec
onds. Last year he tied the world's
record in 6 seconds flat.
After the two-mile run. In which
Missouri didn't have a chance, the re
sult of the meet depended on tbe re
lay, no matter what the outcome of
the pole vaulL Before the last two
events the score stood 37 to 35 In fa
vor of. Kansas.
After Captain Powell had won the
polevault, he tried for a record of 12
feet; but three attempts were unsuc
cessful and he quit.
