lhe Grand Reef Milling Co is the
ownei of one of the biggest mining
propositions in the State The prop
erty consists of seven patented and
six unpatented claims situated in
the north end of Laurel canyon and
distant about three miles north fiom
-the postoffice at Klondyke Aiizona
The immense orebodres of silver
lead gold and copper occur in a
well defined vein tunning north
west and southeast and dipping
seven degrees to the west
Tle vein lies between a granite
foot wall -and a prophyry hanging
wall and varies from 60 to 100 feet
in width tiutcropping 360 feet above
the level of the lowest tunnel in the
canyon
The character of the ore from
the surface down to the 500 foot
level is silver lead gold and copper
The silver runs one ounce to the
per cent of lead and the copper
averages i per cent
Below the 500 foot level the lead
decreases and sulphides come in
gold and silver averages 13 00 to
the ton silver 40 ounces and cop
per 7 per cent across the face of
the crosscut

ledge breaking down and partially
filling this canyon along the north
half of the Giand Reef claim
This is a separate section of the
ledge carrying slight trace of cop
per showing no lead and averaging

silver making an ideal cyanide
proposition for the reason that the
vein so far as explored shows an
entire absence of zinc
The outcroppings of this immense
body of ore can bo traced for 16
miles
The company of which Robert J
Anderson is president J S Purdy
secretaryand treasurer and James
Quinn is general superintendent
has blocked out thousands of tons
of ore besides the big dumps of
ore from the different tunnels that
have been run on the vein on three
levels above ground and on the
south side oj the ledge
The company is erecting n con
centrating plant that will revolu
tionize the method of concentrating
ores Besides being economical the
new method will save 96 p r cent of
the values The mill is situated
above the engine house and the ore
will be crushed in a Quenner chain
hammer pulverizing mill which is
located on a level with the engine
house
The concentrating plant is the in
vention of Mr Anderson the presi
dent of the company and is de
scribed as follows
The ore is brought to the mill on
steel conveyor belts and automati
cally fed into the mill at the rate of
20 tons per hour the grizzily bars
being set to crush to one fourth
mesh From the mill the material
then passes into steel elevator buck
ets and elevated to the top of the
mill 65 feet then passes by gravity
downward The elevator is encased
and forms a conduit to the upper
end of which is connected a 50 inch
suction fan This fan is located on
the outer end of the mill feed bin
The ore is crushed to 16 mesh or
as much finer as ma be necessary to
free the mineral It is then drawn
horizontally into the mill feed bin
where because of its larger area
the velocity of the current is re
duced allowing the mill sands to
fall and lodge in the mill bin The
currents of air are so adjusted that
the fines or slimes to minus 60 or
SO mesh still remain in suspension
hjw y y
ond time with the ore for regrinding
The mill sands from the mill feed
bin pass into a worm feeder and are
fi d to a 48 inch by 14 foot conce 1
trating table known as the Eli n
inator designed and patented by
President Anderson
The sands pass over this first
table where two thirds of the mass
is eliminated The midlings from
the first table passing by gravity
to table No 2 of the same type 22
inches by 14 feet and from table
No 2 to table No 3 16 inches bv
14 feet
On third table the middlings are
taken off composed largely of cop
per oxides and are saved for leach
ing leaving a clean lead concentrate
These tables are new and me of
the vanner type with high lunge
rubber belts set nearly level e imi
nating all waste water currents and
consequent loss of slime values
All material is fed onto head end ol
the table and is carried the length
of the table and agitated under sub
mersion allowing the mineral to
stratify on the belt The sepaia
tion from the sands is affected by
the action of specific gravity
When the sands reach the icar
end of the table the mass is split
horizontally by an adjustable knife
with sharp steel blade Two thirds
of the top strata is cut off and pass
es over dividing blade into tailing
launder and thence to waste dump
For a considerable portion of the
year water by gravity will be sup
plied from the creek during the
the balance of the year the water
needed for the mill will be pumped
from mine and stoied in cement
reseivoir above the mill This res
et voir has a capacity of 150000
gallons
The concentrates from the tables
pass into a two compartment stot
age bin and delivered by conveor
belt onto drying il or and from
theie will be loaded by gravity into
auto trucks and conveved to loading
bunkers at Cork station on the Ari
zona Eastern R R
A new road is now being built
from Aravaipa valley over which
the concentrates will be hauled
The mill will have a capacity of
from 20 to 30 tons per hour accord
ing to coarseness of material
One of the features of this new
concentrating plant is the elimina
tion of all dust from the mill and
concentrator building bv a suction
fan which drnws off the dust mak
ing the air pure and free from
danger of lead poisoning
Electiie power will be used for
operating the mill The company
is installing a 50 K W General
Electiie generator a 10 horse power
motor 220 direct current and a

body of men who had been willing
to adopt measures which would
mean a better government at less
expense but regretted that enrlv in
the session the house had spli up
into political factions and on thn1
account has measured every prop
osition by the effect it might have
on some aspiring politician rather
than by the good or bad effect it
would have on the State
The Gila Valley
In speaking of the Gila valley in
which he has lesided for he past
fitteen ears Mr Kimball said that
conditions there so far as producing

OUT OF GILA RIVER
The Attorney General Sends
Protest to New Mexico
Mining Companies
E MUST BE ABATED
Will Protect Interests of Citi
zens of Arizona by Action
in Court
Attorney General Wiley E Jones
has sent the following letter to the
Socorro Mining and Co
Ernestine Mining and Milliner Co
and Deadwood Mining and Milling
u Mogolion N M protesting
against the discharge of tailings
trom the mills of these companies
into the Frisco river
t
Phoenix Arizona
March 17 1915
GENTLEMENSerious complaint
has come to this office from the peo
ple ot both Greenlee and Graham
counties Arizona that the tailings
discharged by the three above
named companies in the public
streams and which are deposited
through irrigation canals upon the
waters of private owners of land
within said counties are causing
serious damage to the complainants
This office has been urgently re
quested to take steps which will
bring about an abatement of the
conditions complained of The sedi
ments thus deposited are very in
jurious both to the lands of the
complainants and the crops growing
and sought to be grown thereon
I will state further that the dis
charge of said tailings into the
streams which reach the waters of
Arizona are very injurious to the
fish in the public streams of Ari
zona as well as to the cultivated
sections of school land owned by the
State ofArizona which amount to
many thousands oT acres
Tins letter at this time was writ
ten for the purpose of having the
conditions changed and the dis
charge of said tailings into the
streams which reach the waters of
Arizona brought to an end as soon
as possible I am told that the So
corro Mining and Milling Company
is making an effort to abate the
nuisance mentioned but that the
other two above named companies
manifest no desire to end the un
pleasant condition
The complaining citizens of Ari
zona above referred to have a direct
cause for action against the dis
charge of the tailings mentioned
also the State of Arizona on ac
count of the damage to the fish in
its public streams as well as to the
ands of its school sections and the
crops growing thereon has a cause
of action against the discharge of
such tailings as is now going on
I have only to refer you to the
State of Georgia at the relation of
its Attorney General vs the Ten
nessee Copper Company reported
in 206 U S page 230 decided in
1907 also to the case of The Ari
zona Copper Company vs Gillespie
reported in 230 U S page 46 and
decided June 16 1913
In ttie Tennessee case above men
tinned the United States Supreme
Court enjoined the Tennessee Cop
per Co and the Duckwater Co from
discharging noxious vapors in the
atmosphere to the detriment of the
crops in Georgia across the line from
Tennessee
The same Court in the Gillespie
case enjoined the Arizona Copper
Co from discharging its tailings
into the San Francisco river which
readied the irrigating waters of the
settlers holding lands in the Gila
valley The Gillespie case cites the
Tennessee case above mentioned
These two cases are conclusive
upon the rights of the State of Ari
zona and the people of Greenlee and
Graham counties to stop the dis
charge of the tailings of which the
citizens complain For a number
of years the Arizona Copper Com
pany has been paying a citizen of
Graham county the sum of One
Hundred and Fifty 15000 dollars
per month as watchman against the
further discharge of the tailings or
said company under the decree of
the Court handed in the case
As a representative officially of
the State of Arizona I write this
letter of protest against the further
discharge of tailings from the works
of the above named companies with
the hope that the nuisance may be
abated without litigation How
ever if it becomes necessary I shall
bring action on behalf of the State
of Aiizona to put an end to the un
pleasant and damaging conditions
