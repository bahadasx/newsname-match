Associated Press leased wire service to Bisbee Daily
, Review begins March 20
Melville E. Stone
12 22p
In the above telegram from Melville E. Stone, General Manager of the Associated Preis,
is contained confirmation of an achievement in journalism in the Warren District which
signals a new era of progress and enlightenment in this community. Readers of The Re
view throughout Arizona and in the border states of Mexico will share in equal measure
with the Warren District in this journalistic boon.
What does the installation of leased wire service in The Review building mean? Just
this that the news gathering facilities of the Associated Press which extend to every cor
ner of the earth are placed at the command of Review readers. It means that the territory '
served by The Review is no longer remote, from a newspaper viewpoint. It means that this
territory is actually in almost immediate communication with ihe news centres of the
United States, Europte, South America, Asia, in fact, every quarter of the globe.
Beginning next Tuesday, our readers will enioy the newspaper advantage possessed
by residents of the largest cities except for the volume of matter published. When occas
ion warrants, news of the Warren District will be flashed broadcast over the leased wire
installed in The Review office. To sum up briefly the new order of things, the big terri
tory covered by The Review is brought into intimate touch not only with all of our Unit
ed States but with every foreign land. Of equal importance is the fact that the Warren
District will be more closely knit to all other communities in Arizona. The Review will
be enabled to publish all the State news which readers demand. '
Heretofore, residents in The Review's territory have found it desirable occasionally to
buy newspapers published in Los Angeles, El Paso and other cities enjoying leased wire
service in order to reid ALL the news of ALL the world. Beginning Tuesday, The Review
will supply EVERY need of EVERY news-paper reader, and thus furnish ALL the news
of ALL the world from twenty-four to forty-eight hours in advance of the time when out-of-town
papers are received. Further comment on the leased wire service is made on the
editorial page of this issue. ,

EL PASO, March 18. Villa boasted j

of whom were arrested because the

Bill Monday.
i ' WASHINGTON, March 18. - With
virtually unanimous declaration for
national preparedness, house army in
crease bill reached the amendment
stage after a ten hour debate. The
House will begin discussion of details
Monday, but indications are that, the
opposition measure as a change of na
tional policy has collapsed. The Sen
ate's army bill also will come up on
Monday with administration leaders
urging the Senate to sidetrack all oth
er business until disposed of. Interest
centers around the President's attitude
between the two measures, which dif
fer essentially. Chairman Hay of the
House Military Committee described
the House bill as the "President's
own" bill.
Tonight the President let it be
known that while he favors the geuer
?1 features of the Hay bill he will not
be committed to details. Administra
tion officials are looking to the con
ference committee which will adjust
the House and Senate bills after their
passage and produce a measure to
meet the President's full approval.
When the House adjourned Repre
sentative Kahn had a pending amend
ment proposing that the total author

my be 220.000 instead of the commit
tee's figures of 140.000. The test veto

NO FEDERAL AID FOR
ARIZONA TOWNS FROM
MAJOR GEN. FUNSTON
Commanding Officer Wires
Sheriff Wheeler that Locrl
Officers and State Guard
Will Have to be Looked to.
TOMBSTONE. March IS (Special)
There will be no federal aid to the
towns of Cochise county except those
immediately exposed to raids from
Mexico, according . to the mcsee
that was received by Sheriff Wheeler
this morning in reply to the one that
he sent to General Funstod on Thurs
day. The telegram received this
morning reads as follows:
Sheriff HarVy Wheeler.
Tombstone. Ariz.
Replying to your telegram of the
sixteenth, the department commender
directs me to inform you that it is
impossible to furnish guards from
federal troops to all towns in New
Mexico and Arizona that have asked
for them. No less then twenty towns
have requested guards. You can
therefore see that federal troops
would be scattered across these two
states and would not be available for
any concentrate-! action. The only
points that have been given guards
are those that were in imminent
danger of raids by hostile forces from
across the border. All towns that
think themselves in dancer of local
uprising much depend upon their
local authorities first and upon stat
authorities neJ to give thm protec
tion. Federal troops cannot be sent
UDtil after national guards of state
shall have exhausted its efforts.

NOT A SHOT HAS

Changes in Plans May be
Forced if Bandit Leader Re
fuses to be Invited into Fight
with the Americans.
EL PASO. March 18. The first
phase of the American expedition to
Mexico, in its rush along Villa's dim
j trail to the endangered Mormon col
onies is an accomplished fact tonight
: and accomplished without firing a
i hostile shot by the Americans. The
j second phase is already beginning. It
i was indicated, as tbe Americans have
: turned somewhere from Casas Gran
des to resume night marches toward
the rough mountain slopes wher-?
Villa has already preceded with a
start of one hundred miles. There
is a warning that this will not be
accomplished without fighting iti
bandits. It is implied a new and
i more stringent censorship at Coluni
j bus has been established.
j There was brief excitement today
j at Columbus when two soldiers on
j stretchers were brought into camp,
j One was thrown from a horse and
: the other had stomach trouble. When
Washiugton announced the American
column did not intend to occupy the
i cities, a menace to Mexican pride was
removed.
' The American troogs did not enter
i Casas Crandes last night and this
: morning found them camped Bear
, Colonia Dublan. Villa is located, nilb,
, some degree of detiuiieness. in west
ern Chihuahua, nearly due south of
j the American columns.
I All accounts sy Villa is 100 miles
'ahead of the Anierical soldiers. The
Americans are nearing the ground
: over which Villa recently passed
. where they will have an opportunity
,lo test the temper of the rural Uexl
I cans from whotu they might receive
! valuable information.
! The story that Villa is gathering
I :nen and U preparing to resist was
revived in constitutionalist circles. He
: is even said to have ten million rounds
of cartridges and sheils. many of
' home manufacturers secreted iu the
mountains here he is expected to
make a stand.
i Mexican Consul Garcia doubted the
! report and claimed that Villa intends
: to make the expedition a joke. "I am
i convinced Villa intends so play hide
and seek with the Americans. He
will never risk a fcal battle. News
of the rewards will flash through the
j country. I will be surprised if they
' do not bring results."
Garcia denied that tne pevp'e of
Guerrero and Galena were in sympa
thy with Villa. "Many are afraid ot
him because of the rain of terror he
; has inaugurated, but It must ' be re
. membered that Villa of today is not
the Villa of five years ago."
PLANS MAY CHANGE.
SAN ANTONIO. March IV Failure
by Villa :o make a stand, and fight be
fore the end of next week, will rad
ically alter the methods employed so
far b the commander of the punitiv
expedition. Pershing's plan is not re
vealed and will not be if Funston can
prevent it. Every effort will be made
to keep the troops' movements a
iecret. I'ershiug's scouts may hae
brought him information on Villa's
location but such as were received at
general headquarters heie makes any
assertion little better reason to be
lieve that Villa has retreated as the
Americans advanced and that he i
somewhere in the Galena district,
south of Casas Grjndes. .Most of the
reports place him trom sixty to one
hundred miles south of Casas Graa
tie in the mountains.
When Pershing start ed the junction
of troops which has taken place at
Casas Grandes. as planned without
expectation that Villa would e sight

only chance to eatch im at thit
stage ws that he would gather bla
forces and resist the advaic.
According to Punston's repe-H nftt
a shot was fired at the invader.
