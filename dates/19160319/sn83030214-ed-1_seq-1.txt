M. Ribot's utterance is taken to he of the utmost importance as
indicating official opinion with regard to the result of the battle of

London. March 18.?Lord Robert Cecil, in reply to the question
of whether there were any signs of peace in Germany, declared.
"Looking at it broadly, with nothing specific in mind, I should say
Germany is more anxious for peace. I mer?n that the economical
and poli?.dl situation there is growing more unfavorable. The failure
st Verdun ?sill have and has h.^d a had effet. However, you must
remember that a nation at war will put up with privations for s long
time."
