Mann Asserts Hay
Army Measure to Be
Inadequate to Needs
WASHINGTON', March IS. Tho house
military bill is President Wilson's own
bill. Chairman Hay of the military com
jnittee informed tho house today, when
debate on the measure was resumed
under the ten-hour rule.
"I may say," ha said in . reply to a
question, "in broad language that this Is
the president's bill; that he thoroughly
approves of It."
Chairman Hay said the bill "carries
out the recommendations of the presi
dent's message and goes a little farther."
He added that while tho bill did not con
tain the continental army provision the
president was satisfied the proposed fed
eralization pf tho Rational Guard would
accomplish the same purpose.
wvlt-aldlipreKcntaUve Moore, re
publican, of Pennsylvania, 'gentlemen
'oting for this bill will be voting for the
president's convictions?"
"They will," Mr. Hay responded.
Representative Mann, minority leader,
attacked the bill as being inadequate to
meet the demands of the present time.
He said:
"We are having a little trouble on the
border of Mexico and are sending a few
soldiers Into that country The time for
this came after we had had troops on
the border for four years in contempla
tion of that very thing. Yet when this
trouble occurred these troops were not
actually sent across the border until the
house had passed a resolution ordering
an Increase of 30,005 men to take the
places of the few soldiers who might
cross.
"Never was there a more pat illustra
tion Uhan that of the fact that the
present army and the proposed Increase
in it, while sufficient in times of artual
peace, would not bo sufficient In time of
war or when any occasion arises for even
a miniature war. and today we have
the greatest war of the ages going on."
Representative Mann said the United
States must take a prominent place In
defending Its own rights and those of
smaller neutrals and in upholding Inter
national laws
"I believe," e said, "that It la the
duty of the United States to prepare now
an army which will add to the weight of
the suggestions we make."
"Tlie time has come when It is wise
for us to consider the possibility and even
the probability of the future and prepare
now for what may come to us. If we
do not prepare now we may regret It to
the end of our lives."
Representative Kahn, rnnking minority
member of the military committoe, said
war came suddenly in modern times, and
wisdom and patriotism demanded a rea
sonable measure of preparedness for war.
With adequate preparation In peace
times, he said, thousands of lives might
have been saved in the country's wars.
"Great Britain was compelled finally to
adopt conscription," ho said. "I believe
that If ever we become Involved In any
great war It will become necessary to
resort to the draft."

erating near Chihuahua City.
General Gutierrez said that Villa
was enroute to Namiquipa, ten miles
south of Las Cruces, where Villa was
located In earlier advices to General
Gavira at Juarez, to recover a quan
tity of ammunition which he left
there several months ago.
Una Shells Cached.
It was said by local Mexicans that
Villa has not less than 10,0U0,X) rounds
of ammunition cached In various parts
of Chlhuauha. These shells and powder
were mado by Villa, tliey said, in his
Chihuahua munitions factory during last

Tho message from General Gutlerrci
did not contain any information as to
the sire of the cache at Namiquipa, nor
was there any local Information concern
ing the amount of ammunition hidden
there. '
Lieutenant Colonel Da to Campbell, In
command of Carranr-a troops guarding
the mountain passes along tho Honors
Chlhuahua state line, arrived In Agua
Prleta last night and held a conference
today with General P. Ellas Calles. mili
tary governor of Sonora.
Colonel Campbell came to Agua Prleta
to confer with General Calles concern
ing the disposition of his troops and to
obtain a new supply of food and car
tridges. He stated that ho believed that
Villa would not be able to enter Sonora
and at the same' time said-that In his
opinion the United State troops would
have much difficulty In capturing the"
bandit chief.
A flees Calles.
Campbell reported that Villa was In
Galeana, Chihuahua, last Monday, go
ing from there to Janos, where he car
ried off all available supplies.
The colonel said that while the Amer
ican troops were searching for Villa In
the mountains In western Chihuahua the
bandit likely would conduct raids along
or near the Texas border in the eastern
part of the Mexican state.

SAN ANTONIO. Tex., March IS. Gen
eral Kunston this afternoon had received
no official confirmation of the nrrlvat
at Casas Grandes of a part of the ex
peditionary force, but he assumed the
correctness of the report. General
Pershing's west column, under Colonel
Dodd, had Casas Grandes as its imme
diate objective, but Its arrival last night
was a surprise to those at headquarters,
who had not believed it likely that tho
distance would be covered so quickly.
The main column, according to the lat
est reports from General Pershing, waa
continuing lis march without interrup
tion, not far northwest from the advanced
cavalry force.
The work of organizing the additional
forces that have been sent into Texas
and New Mexico along the border was
continued today. From many places near
the border, where the population Is
largely Mexican, appeals for the protec
tion of troops have been made, but these
appeals have been based on no overt hos
tile act of the Mexicans.
The garrison at Nogalcs -will not be
materially weakened, although the re
moval of one company of Infantry
brought a protest to General Funston.
End of War in Sight,
Says the Minister of
Finance, A. Ribot
PARIS, March IS. "We have reached
the deellv hour," aald Alexandre Hibot,
minister or finance, speaking in the
Chamber of Deputies last night on the
financial and military situation. "We
can say, without exaggeration, without
illusion and without violation of optim
ism, that we now see the end of this
horrible war."
. M. lUbot's utterance Is taken to be of
utmost importance, as indicating official
opinion wtth retard to the small results
of the battle of Verdun. Whether peace
is or is not appreciably nearer, It Is Un
questionable that the tenalon In Fran'e
has relaxed and that men's thoughts are
turned to the rupid development of event
favorable to the allies.

BERLIN, March 16. (Via Lon

today to introduce at this session lta
measure calling for the carrying on
of submarine war.
Tha National liberals tent the .follow
ing messaga to Admiral Von Tlrplts:
"We art deeply moved by tha news of
the retirement of your eaceiicncy In tha
presmit difficult time. AVa send to. the
creator of our navy" and tha father of
tha German naval spirit assurance of tha
truest and most thankful devotion."
Teat of nesolntlon.
. nWKLIN. March .-Vla Wireless , to
Bayllle.)-The National Liberty party has
Introduced the following measure lit the
Reichstag:
"Considering that Great Britain not
only makes war on the armed forces of
Uermany, but has taken measures in or
der to Impede the providing of Germany
with food supplies and raw material, so
as to compel Uermany to submit through
hunger, fur which purpose Great Britain
brutally violates International law and
employs force against neutral countries;
considering further that Germany Is able
through unlimited and unrestrained sub
marine warfare to Increase tha British
lack of tbnnaga so that It can bo made
extraordinarily difficult and perhaps Im
possible for tha British nation to obtain
sufficient supplies of food and raw ma
terials, considering that such warfare
would bring more speedily a victorious
end of tha war, the imperial chancellor
Is required to enter into no arrangements
with other countries which would hinder
us In the unlimited use of the submarine
weapon and to permit in the war sons,
against the enemy's traders, with the
exception of passenger ships, such use of
submarines as arises from the peculiar
ity of said weapons."
Similar bills were brought forward by
the conservative and center parties.

of tha characteristics of an Invasion, and
that there was no object In occupying
towns or cities, because the American
troops will keep constantly on the move.
Officials said today that the situation
at Tampico, where uneasiness Is said to
exist among Americans and other for
