Prof. II. G. McGowan, head of the
boys' corn club movement in Lown

of the occasion was the address by i
Prof. Cobb, who urged the boys
present to join both the pig and
corn clubs, declaring that the best I
results could be obtained only
through membership in both organ-
izations. He said thnt thp hnv must !

and the best plan to pursue in rais-I
ing it was to join the corn club and
tc compete for the various prizes to I
which its members are eligible. i

whether "or not it can be at once

outcome of the impending election.

A PERENNIAL FUND
If It Becomes a Law Biennial
Disputes Over Appropria
tions Will Cea se.
- 1 A meamie which vitally affect
- ! the Industrial Institute und Collet'
in this city was recently introduce I
in the state Senate at Jackson, as
its adoption means that perem.at
provision wilt be made for the sup
port and maintenance not only of the
local institution, but of the Univer
sity of Mississippi and the A. and M.
College, and the biennial bickerings
anil disputes will cease.
The bill, which is now under con
sideration, was introduced by Sena
tor S. A. Miller, senator from the
Twenty-fourth district, who has
made public the following explana
tion of its provisions and the advan
tages to be gained by its adoption:
"The concurrent resolution which
I introduced proposing a constitu
tional amendment placing the high
er educational institutions on a mil
eage basis, I believe to be a worthy
mensure.
"This amendment would revolt in
would do much to take the institu
tions out of politics; a menace to
their development and usefulness. By
giving these institutions a fixed an
nual support fund the heads of them
could adopt the courses accordingly;
many departments are established in
some institutions believing that a
sufficient support can be obtained,
and later such d p.utments have to
be discontinued on account of a lack
of support. Every, iwo years there
exists a condition of unrest on the
part of the members of the faculty,
and as a result many of the teachers
seek employment elsewhere. In this
way our institutions have suffered
a great loss. Then it is necessary
each session of the Legislature for
the president of these institutions to'
leave their duties and come to the
1 c"P'tol to explain the needs of their
i institutions,
"By placing these institutions on
a mileage basis, the Legislature
would be relieved of a great annoy
ance and a responsibility that only a
few of the members are capably of
executing. The State of Tennessee
has such a provision and the matter
of financing these institutions does
not con,um any of the Legislature's
', Umv nor it an issue during the
ampaign. It mut be admitted that
the iiuestion of financing these in
stitutions is a determining iiuestion
on the part of many of the voters in,
their choice for representatives and
senators, and no doubt some men
for that reason are often defeated."
"The governor's recommendations
for reducing the appropriations for
the support of various state colleges
when compared, are very signifi
cant. His proposed reductions below
what was appropriated for each in
stitution two years ago, in round
numbers is as follows:
"For the Normal College at Hat
tiesburg, $ I. '1,000; for the Industrial
Institute and College at Columbus,
$:i;,000; for the University of Mis
sissippi, $.TJ,000; for the Mississippi
Agricultural and Mechanical College,
$87,000.
"The reduction for the Industrial
Institute and College and the reduc
tion for the University is each about
three times as great as that recom
mended for the Normal College, and
the reduction for the Agricultural
and Mechanical College is seven
times as great as that recommended
for the Normal College, and is about
the same as that recommended for
all three of the other institutions
combined."
