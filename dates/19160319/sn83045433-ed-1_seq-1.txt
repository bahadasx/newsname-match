The next halt was made eighteen miles
further Into the interior at Colonia.

ment is located.. I saw a telegram at
5 o'clock to Bishop Hurts, head of the
colonists, from Guy Taylor, the Mormon

were well and happy again.
Equals all Records.
The splendid endurance record of both
troopers and horses equalled, if it did
not Wxceed, all previous high marks.
The Mexican cavalry detachment which
started out as an advance guard was
passed during the night and dropped so
far to the rear they have not yet been
reported.
Army officers here say especial credit
should be given the Tenth, which is a
negro regiment, but there is glory enough
for all, with a spare measure left for the

Casas Grandes IS located directly be

Valle. twenty miles south of Galeans. on
the Santa Maria River. 1le is making
for the passes througth the Sierra Madre
Mountains. which lead to the Guerrero
district, where his chief strongholds are
located. The government information is
Kaad not to coincide with the statements
of the Mexican authorities that the bandit
leader is disbanding his forces.
The main column of the expeditionary
forces, with which are Gen. Pershing's
headquarters, are said to be less than
fifty miles south of the border. They
are moving south-by-east from Ascen
cion. This line of march will carry them
direct to Casas Grandes or by a slight
deviation, to the Mexican Northwestern
Railway line.
The Sixth and Sixteenth Infantry es
tablished a second base at Doca Grande
this morning. Detachments of foot sol
diers are moving forward as rapidly as
possible to do guard duty in keeping the
lines of communication open.
Demand 200 Miles of Wire.
A demand was made on the local
branches of the telegraph companies
today for 200 miles of line wire. This
may mean that difficulty has been ex
perienced with the field wireless appara
tus, due to the topography of the country
through which the troops expect to
travel.
Twenty cars loaded with motor trucks
and automobiles, manned with chauffeurs
and mechanicians, passed through El
Paso en route to Columbus, today. A
great many new cavalry horses are also
being rushed to thte base. It is under
stood that mounts wil, be furnished for
the infantry as rapidly as the horses can
be obtained.
Military activities are now in evidence

came to El Paso from Fort Bliss this
afternoon to hold a secret conference

It is admitted that every day the cam

to remain at San Antonio, 100 miles in

get the spirit of the real information con

Epecial Cable !o The Washington Herald.
Paris, March IS.-Pages from the diary
of a high officer, written during the bat

They tell a story tragic with its sim
plicity. Here is what the officer wrote:
"February ri-'m still alive, but what
horror. This is the greatest battle ever
fought. The Verdun forts are belching
death without a respite. German corp
can be counted in tenls of thotusands.
Half a million men face one another and
still more are arriving.
"February :-The battle now has been
raging a week. The Germans accumu
lated their fiightfulest engines of de
struction and their best troops, but they
have not been able to get the better of
our soldiers.
Verdun Declared Saved.
'Verdun is saved by him who saved

unceasingly. Ten motor wagons loaded
with men arrive every minute.
"The Germans left mountains of dead

of the Meuse today, the Germans d
veloping several attacku' ngainst the
Vaux-Hiaudremont front. The midnight
communication from Paris states that
they were repulsed at all points.
West of the Meuse. where a titanic
struggle has been raging for possession
of Dead Man lill, the commanding point
of the battlefield, the foot roldiers rested t
in their trenches today while the big
guns prepared the way for fresh attacks.
The heaviest German tire was concen
trated in the region of ois Bourru
(H-angman's wood) and around Montue
ville. according to thc French report.
This forest of sinirtor name is about
a tre and a lialf south of Dead Man Iill,
while Montzeville is about half a mile
west of the foreit. Fort le Mairre and
Fort De BOis Bmrru are on the edge
of the woods and the indications are that
the Germans are pouring a heavy fire
into them.
The attacks east of the Meuse were
launched following a strong preparatory
bombardment. which lasted throughout
the night. The French positions in the
village of Vaux and the wood south or
the laudremont farm were the objectives
of the Germans.
From their concealed gun emplace
ments, the French poured a heavy shrap
nel and machine gun tire into the
advancing Germ'ans and after several
fruitless efforts to push the attack, the
Teutons retired to their trenches and the
guns again took up their work.
