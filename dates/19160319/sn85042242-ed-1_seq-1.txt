'.North Dakota will be the third
stale in the Union to express a presi­
dential preference. Indiana headed
the list, with a perfunctory endorse­
ment of Fairbanks as the republican
choice and President iWilson was en­
dorsed without opposition by the
democrats. 'Minnesota expressed a
preference indifferently last week.
The choice was between Cummins
and Estabrook and the former won

conducting a friendly contest, but
there is not the interest engendered

campaigns in the history of the state.
This was the Jirst presidential prim

May Bring Out Democrats.
The bitter fight being waged by the
Perry-Bruegger factions for national
committeeman may bring out the nor­
mal democratic primary vote of about
13,000 or 14,000 votes. Four years
ago there was a lively contest be­
tween Jones of Rock and Purcell for
the senatorial nomination. This year
the factional strife is even stroller
and should bring out more than the
usual democratic vote.
Politicians who have been over the
state the last, few days say they
never saw less interest shown in an
election. The only spice engendered
has been by the Estabrook forces,
who have had their candidate in the
state the entire week. He conclud­
ed his speaking tour at Grand Forks
last evening.
LaFollette forces have not been
making a vigorous campaign. There
has been no acrimony and, as far as
the republican party officially is con­

GUN PLAY IN
Muskogee, Olila., March 18.—Faction­
al rivalries made the 'Muskogee coun­
ty republican convention today a
scene of riotous tumult, which was
not ended until J. C. Denton, one of
the two rival chairmen, was pulled
from the desk'on which he stood and
arrested, charged with carrying con­
cealed weapons into a meeting. With
his arrest the supporters of J. J. Mc
Graw of Ponca City, candidate for
national committeeman withdrew
from the hall and the adherents of
James Harris of Wagoner, rival can­
didate for the same position, contin­
ued their deliberations.
The Harris and McGraw factions
tried to hold conventions in the same
hall and attempts to transact busi­
ness precipitated disorder until the
delegates came to personal encounter
and fought, clawed and scratched.
Denton's arrest was based on charges
in the warrants issued for him that
he drew his pistol and threatened
George Pnstol, another delegate.

WILSON REFUSES TO
SHOW HIS HAND
Washington, March 18.—With vir­
tually unanimous declaration for na­
tional preparedness the house army
increase bill reached the house to­
day, after ten hours' general debate.
The house will begin discussion of
details in earnest Monday, but there
are indications that opposition to the
measures, as a change in national
policy, has collapsed. No opponent
appeared during the debate except
'Meyer London, the socialist repre­
sentative from New York.
The senate's army bill also will
come up Monday with the administra­
tion urging that the senate sidetrack
all other business. Interest center­
ed tonight in President Wilson's atti­
tude as between these two measures,
which differ essentially.
Chairman lHay of the house mili­
tary committee described the house
bill during the debate today as "the
president's own bill." Republican
Leader Mann questioned the accu­
racy of this description.
"Doubtless the president favors
the best he can obtain," Mr. Mann
said "I have no doubt he favors it
over existing laws."
Tonight, President Wilson let it be
known that, while he approves the
general features of the Hay bill, he
has not committed himself to its de­
tails. Administration officials are
looking to the conference committee
which will adjust the house and sen­
ate bills after passage, to produce
a measure which will have the presi­
dent's full approval.
Speaker Clarke closed the general
debate in the house, expressing ap­
proval of the Hay bill and declaring
it satisfactory and as good as could
be expected under the circumstances.
The nation, as a whole, he said, wish­
ed to hold a middle course.
MAXIM URGES PREPAREDNESS.

'Maxim, inventor and member of the
naval consulting board, speaking on

that "we must spend all we can and
be prepared, and then if we do not
have any war, we shall have only
paid our insurance, and gained by
service of our youths a better gener­
ation to come, with patriotism, loyal­
ty and happiness." The money that
is used for fire departments, Mr. Max­
im said, should be doubled for de­
fense.
TO ENLIST A MILLION BOYS.
New York, March 18.—More than
2,500 boys of the elementary schools
of New York and Brooklyn answered
the call of the National School Camp
association and signified their willing­
ness to prepare themselves for war in
times of peace. The boys enrolled at
armories and United States officers
were in charge 01 the registration.
The boys will wear army uniforms
but guns will net be supplied them. It
was explained that the effort is to en­
list a million boys in the movement'.

BILL TO HAVE
EMIINC
Least Two Years
More.
Sam H. Clark, editor of Jim Jam
Jems, returned to Bismarck yesterday
after an extern.trip over the Euro­
pean war zone. He visited many
points of interest in the Central pow­
ers and has brought home a mass of
interesting data showing the German
side of the controversy. Ho prepared
the following interview for the Tri­
bune last evening:
"1 am certainly glad to gel. back to
Xorth Dakota again. 'While 1 had a
most interesting trip and an exper­
ience that is invaluable, there was
considerable grief thrown in.
On Wrong Foot.
"First of all, I got off on the wrong
foot with the Ford party and this
came preUy near precluding any
chance to get into the war zone.
While the Peace expedition has been
criticised quite severely, it was not by
any moans a fool trip. There was a
good chance that something might
come of it, and every belligerent coun­
try was afraid to recognize a member
of the Ford party for fear that they
might be accused of having instigated
it. I «m positive that Henry Ford had
an absolute honesty of purpose and
the fact that he had the courage to
attempt and carry out. the expedition
is certainly commendable. But Mr.
Ford was poorly advised and decided­
ly unfortunate in the selection of his
lieutenants who handled the peace ex­
pedition.
"While there were a number of
really sane delegates—both men and
women—jfcho MiuJd hav« pet-fee! edt an
organization on the peace ship and at
least liave conducted the affair with
dignity and caused a world-wide peace
sentiment to spread, unfortunately
there Avere not enough safe and sane
members in the party to leaven the
loaf, and with Madame Schwimmer
and a horde of other "isimites" and
fanatics in control, the peace dove
commenced to molt before we left
New York harbor. You know the re­
sult. It is not necessary for me to go
into detail.
Left Peace Party.
"Governor tlanna and myself left
the peace party soon after our arrival
in Christiania. We intended to go to
Denmark and then into Germany to
study the war situation. Governor
Hanna was ill most of the time on the
voyage, and was not feeling well in
Christiania. On the way to Denmark
he became very ill. We were snow­
bound in Sweden twent.v-four hours,
and when Ave finally arrived in Copen­
hagen I took him at once to a hospi­
tal. After two days, the doctors an­
nounced that he had typhoid fever.
He grew steadily worse, and on the
fourth day the doctors told me that

WIFE
SHOOTS
SELF DEFENSE
'Frederick, Md., March 18.—Mrs.
Eloise Young, English, shot and killed
her husband, Arthur E. English, a
lawyer of New York, at their homo
near here today. The shooting was
done in the prcecncc of tlieii six-year
old daughter, one of four children.
The shooting is said to have occurred
during a quarrel. English was the
son of Thomas Duen English, a for­
mer congressman from New Jersey
and author of the song "Ben Bolt."
Mrs. English claims that she shot
in self-defense, when her husband, in
a fit of anger, pointed a revolver at
her. The furniture in the room in
which the body was found was in
great disorder, indicating that a
struggle had taken place.
iMrs. English was exonerated of
the blame in the killing of her hus­
band, by a coroner's jury here to­
night.
The young woman testified that
while their two sons were putting up
wood this morning she requested her
husband to let the elder boy quit on
account of illness. Angered, he be­
gan to smash dishes and furniture.
Mrs. English secured a revolver, hid
it in her dress, and later when her
husband took his revolver and threat­
ened to kill her, she emptied the five
chambers of the revolver in his body.
Frederick Arthur English was the
assistant attorney in the department
of the interior. He- resigned to re­
sume practice in this city.

SEES E'NC* OF WAR.
'Paris, March 18.—"We have
have reached the decisive hour,"
said Alexandre Ribot, minister of
finance, speaking in the chamber
of deputies last night on on fin­
ancial and military situation.
"We can say without exagger­
ation, without illusion, that we
now see the end of this horrible
war."
M. Ribot's utterance is taken
to be of the utmost importance
as indicating official opinion with
regard to the result of the battle
of Verdun. Whether peacc is or
is not appreciably nearer, it is
unquestionable that the tension
in France has relaxed and man's
thoughts are turned to the rapid
developments of events favorable
to the Allies.
London, March 18.—The German
offensive in the Verdun region, now
nearing the end of irs fourth week,
has again slackened decidedly, both
Paris and Berlin reporting the contin­
ued absence of infanlry operations by
either side. The Dig guns here and
there along the front in the vicinity
of the fortress arc intermittently
pounding opposing positions, but the
chief activity just at present seems to
be by the airmen.
Air Raids Numerous.
'Numerous raids by French aviators
are reported by tlxi Paris war office,
the points bombarded including the
railway stations of Conflans and Metz.
The showers of heavy shells dropped
are declared to hitv^ J-gp&jeffective in

In Russia there has been only spor­
adic fighting, although there are signs
of preparations for movements of
probable importance, particularly
along the northern end of the line.
The Austrians have turned on the
Italians along the Isonzo, where the
initiative has recently been, for the
most part, with General Cadonaro's
force. Vienna announces a success­
ful attack north of the Tolmino bridge
head in which Italian positions were
captured, together with nearly 500
prisoners and three machine guns.

west of Solium, says an official re­
port issued tonight on the progress
of the campaign, shooting down the
gun servers and scattering the hos­
tile force. Ninety shipwrecked sail­
or who had landed on the Cyrenian
coast, and had been seized by the
Senussi were rescued.

tion between Grece, Germany, Aus

has been cut.
The financial situation in Grecce
appears to be of the gravest nature.
The families of mobilized soldiers in

Berlin, March lS.—"Emperor Wil­

thanking him for the excellent ser­
vices he had rendered the country as
creator and organizer of the German
navy.
"The emperor at the same time or­

Sau Antonio, March 18.—Failure by
Francasco Villa, on whose trail more
than 4,000 American troops are
marching, to make a stand and fight
before the end of next week will radi­
cally alter the methods, so far em­
ployed by the commander of the puni­
tive expedition.
What General Parsing's plan is,
however, has not been revealed and
will not be, if General Funston can
prevent it.
Every effort will be made to keep
secret' the movement, of troops, it it
becomes necessary to abandon the di­
rect line of pursuit with the units of
the little army practically in contact.
The One Chance.
When General Pershing led the ex­
peditionary force over the boundary
line into Mexico, the juncture of
troops which has taken place near
Casas Grandest was planned with little
•expectation. tl?at-.Villa \vpuld be-sight­
ed before this time. It was realized
the only chance of the Americans to
catch him at that stage of the opera­
tion was that he would gather his
forces and resist their advance.
Not only did he not do that, but ac­
cording to General Funston's reports,
not a shot was fired at the invaders.
To force Villa to fight or trap him
in one of his many hiding places has
now become the object of General
Pershing's plan. Whether Villa will
resist a fight or play out the role of a
common fugitive is a subject for spec­
ulation.
Relieves Tension.
Unofficial reports that General Per­
shing did not insist upon sending into
Casas Grandes the advance cavalry
force, after it' was intimated such
entry would be resisted, lowered the
tension at General Funston's head­
quarters. General Funston was con­
vinced that General Pershing would
not pass his troops through any Mex­
ican town unless he regarded it as a
military necessity, but' in case of ne­
cessity Jie was prepared to endorse
the action of the man on the spot.
General Pershing continued his re­
port of developments of the plan, none
of his reports dealing with unexpect­
ed or unusual incidents.
Marfa, Texas, March 18.—A mes­
senger from IMexico arrived at the
Presidio this morning with a report
that Villa bandits were mobilizing to
attack Presidio.
'Most of the American women left
iMarfa this afternoon. Capt. Sibley
of the 14th Cavalry conferred today

commander at Ojinaga, opposite Pre­

Carranza troops were reported co­
operating with the American forces
for possible defense against the ban­
dits.
Trucks Arrive.
The arrival of a trainload of motor
trucks in Columbus tonight made it
certain that the American forces in
the field will be amply supplied where
ever they may go.
It is also known that fhe American
expeditionary forcc is taking every
precaution against the disease which
has followed four long years of civil
warfare in northern Mexico. All along
the border, also, medical officers of
the United States Immigration depart­
ment are taking increased care to pre­
vent the introduction into the United
States of the smallpox, which is ram­
pant in Mexico, particularly in the
western part of Sonora.
Prosecutions under the national de­
fense law of 1911 will follow violation
of the censorship order.
All correspondents were obliged to
register today and present credentials
at military headquarters. Major Sam­
ple, the censor, frankly informed
them their services would be of little
value and intimated that the censor­
ship may be extended to other border
towns. The ruins of the Commercial
hotel has been searched for souvenirs.
Several sabers, presumably dropped
by Villa officers, have been picked up.

BANDS COLLECTING TO
RESIST INVADING FORCE
No Intention on Part of Adminis­

Town.
El Paso, Texas, March A8.—The
first phase of the American expert*
tion into Mexico—the rush along Vil­
la's dim trail to the endangered Mor­
mon colonies—was an accomplished
fact last night, completed, according
to report:* reaching thee Columbus
base, without the firing of a hostile
shot by the 'Americans.
The second phase -was already be
ginning^ it was indicated here, as
the Americans turned somewhere
from Casas Grandes to resume their
night marches under the brilliant
Mexican moonlight toward the rough
mountain slopes, where it is known
Francisco Villa has preceded "them
with almost 100 miles start.
Warning that this second act in
the chasef might not pass without
fighting against bandits was implied
j%a.Bew and more stringent cewsor
'smp imposed at 'Coloifrbus. Further
leakage of news of military moves,
the censor said, frankly, to the Am­
erican Press, would be likely to cahse
soldiers' lives.
Excitement at Columbus.
There was excitement at Coluinbua
today, when from across the" hot,
dusty 'Mexican border two soldiers ot
stretchers were brought into camp.
Doth weire artillery men.' Hkclte
ment passed when it was learned
that one had been thrown from his
horse, injuring his leg, while the oth­
er was suffering from a well knowa
form of stomach ache.
When Washington announced that
the American columns did not intend
to occupy cities, a menace to 'Mexi­
can national pride was removed. The
Carranza garrison which had been
passed by the marching Americans
and which therefore are in the Am­
ericans' rear or on their flank, con­
tinued tranquil, so reports to £1 Paso
indicated.
Dawn showed the long lines of car
airy horses just outside Colonia Dub
Ian, their troopers dismounted and
in camp at rest.
Villa Is Located.
Villa was located today with some
degree of definiteness, if weight of
evidence counts in pinning down his
rapid shifts, nearly due south of the
American column's present known po­
sition and close to the Sierra Tara
humare mountains—so close to them*
in fact, that if his reputations as a
fox holds good during the American
chase, he should be able to make a
puzzling disappearance in their rang­
es with a very few hard hours' rid­
ing. 'By all accounts he is more than
100 miles ahead of the Americans.
Has Ammunition.
The story that Villa is gathering
men and preparing to resist was re­
vived in constitutionalist circles to­
day and he is said to have ten mil­
lion rounds of cartridges and shells
secreted in the mountains where he
was expected to make a stand. Doubt
that Villa would do any such thing
was expressed, however, by Andreas
Garcia, the American consul here.
v*ho claimed that Villa Intends to
make the American expeditionary
force a joke. Mr. Garcia declared
he had "positive information that
Villa was disbanding his men, and
intended to hide in the mountains
with three or four of his trusted fol­
lowers and defy the Americans to
find him. An army might wander la
that region for years and never find
a man like Villa, who knows eWT
foot of the ground/'
The rewards which have been of*
fered for Villa, alive or dead, in Mr.
Garcia's opinion, are the best hopes
of ending his career*
North Central Mexico, in the negh
borhood of the former Villa strong­
hold of Torreon and about Daraago,
