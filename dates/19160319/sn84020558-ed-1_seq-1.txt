COMMITTEE FIXES

State Central Committee
Harmoniously I) e c ides
Preparatory Issues Suf-
assae ot
Resolution
On the promise that at Tucson can
1 found the cement with which to
latch up the jagged holes, caused by
the convention of 1912. and because
1'ima county had the votes and then
Fonif, the republican state central
(ommittee yesterday named the Old
Pueblo as 'lie place for the 00111111!?
state convention. May fi was fixed as
the date, and the duties of the con
vention were made so elastic that,
after having named delegates to the
Chicago convention and nominated a
national committeeman, the assembly
may turn its attention to the task of
measuring up some candidates for
congressional and state offices. In
providing this last, the committee
made it known very audibly that the
olive branch was being extended to
progressives.
Aside from a fen jars that were
muffled almost into silence, the pro
te?s of putting the stale republican
automobile in tune was rapid and so. -ccssful.
The word "harmony" was so
earnestly spoken that it lost consid
erable of its triteness, and sounded
more . like a watchword than has any
ntteiance of a similar convention
herr-about. for about four years
Republican leaders, both of .Mari
copa county and of the state at large,
regard yesterday's conference as
totally satisfactory. The program that
had been mapped out by the state
chairman. Judge Kibbev, was rigidly
adhered 10. even though the delega
tion of the local members of th Con
gressional fnion for national suffrage
managed to hypnotize the meeting in
to committing itself on the Stither-laiid-Momlell
resolution. In fa.'t. the
nearest to a fissure that w as permit -ted
to appear on the surface, was the
division of the membership over the
propriety of passing on such a c,ues
tion; surely, there remained no do'ub'
in anybody's mind that the commit
teemen as individuals were heartily in
favor of national suffrage.
Clecause the committee made a
stouter fight for tie principle that
proscribes its power than did the
derribrratic' state central committee
some days ago. the final acceptance!
of the resolution of the suffragists
was made to appear much less grace
ful than it reall was. A vote of 4!!
to CO to sustain the chair in an av-j
peal from this decision ruling the
resolution out of order, tberetore ap- I
peared in the ttoe light of final ac-j
tion as merely a protest against the
necessity of passing on the ouestinn.
nnd not a protest against the claims
of the women. The resolution was
finally passed under a suspension of
the rules, and no voice w is beard
when the call came for the "nays."
Admittedly an unfortunate issue,
the ouestion if considering the suf
fnge resolution drew the warmest
debate of any that was heard yester
day. I!. J. Thompson of Yavaiiai
county led the fight in favor of tlv
instant passage of the resolution while
the speaker against that course were
unite numerous, until, by some in
tangible means, the intelligence per
vaded the meeting that the resolution
would go through no matter what.
Judge L"W is conceded that the
ladies were morally deserving of a
favorable vote, but technically unde
serving of ::ny kind of a vote. Sec
tetary Tommy Maddock argued that
the refusal to consider the resolution.
on whatever grounds, would merely j
result in convincing the political in-
fant class the women that these
chaps were, not for them. The cool j
manner in winch Mr. Maddock insin
