S STRIKE
Sail Francisco, Mar. 18. With a
strike at tbe Union Iron works
threatened, and a walk-out at tbe
Moore ft Soott shipyards In Oakland
already started, the shipbuilding la
duslry on tbe I'aclflo coast faced one
ot tbe most' serious situations In It
recent history.
At least four unions, representing
probably 1,500 skilled employes of
the Union Iron works, held secret
meetings yesterday and sent strike
votes to tbe International organisa
tions In the east, it was learned to
day. Tbey are prepared to walje out,
It Is said, upon the receipt of word
from tbe eastern bodies.
Boilermakers, abtp flttersv ship
riveters and shipbuilders are all or
ganised to a man. it waa declared
today.
In Oakland the carpenters at the
Moore ft 8cott yards walked out on
orders of tbe executive committee of
the Building Trades council. Their
grievance Is that non-union ship car
penters are employed.
In the action or the Union Iron
works men, several demands are
made, among them the following:
Working time from 8 to 5; time
and one-half from 5 up to midnight,
and double time after midnight.
' Double time 'for boiler work on
aged, wrecked or generally decrepit
sblpa brought In Instead of time and
one-half.
Double time tor work on holidays.
With shipbuilding activity boom
ing as probably never before, a strike
would be a serious blow, as scores of
Immense contracta are being bandied
everywhere.
ASK CARRANZA FOR
USE OF RAILWAYS
Washington, Mar. 18.- To expe
dite operations against Francisco
Villa, General Funstoa has asked
Provisional President Carranca'a per
mission to use Mexican railroads In'
supplying the American columns
with ammunition. Officials 1 refused
to comment on tbe request 'and re
fused to divulge whether the .state
department youldTafQn7 getting the'
desired permission. -
Should Carransa grant the United
States .leave, to use Mexican railways
for military purposes, the army
would solve one of Its most .difficult
problems. Food, ammunition and
water' could oe transported by t rail'
safely and quickly'' if nder present
conditions they must be "carried by
creeping wagons and 'motor 'trucks
through 66 miles of sand and soap
weed. Mule-drawn wagon's can make
at the best only three miles an hour.

German Attacks About Ver
dua Ilaye Lost Their Vim,
aiid Abasfaeat of Of
fenstVe Predicted bLondca
By. C. P. Stewart "
London, Mar. 18 A marked slack
ening In violence ot the JSghtlng
around Verdun convinced some mili
tary critics today that the Germans
were about to abandon the offensive
there.
Paris despatches conveyed the
same Idea and hinted thU a final
German defeat at Verdun would be
immediately followed by the great
est French smash of the war.
Tbe Paris messagea eald German
attacks lacked their early spirit and
tbat less artillery preparation pre
ceded them. The Teutons are not
standing up to French counter-attacks
as they did when the battle' was
young, especially at Douaumont and
around Vaux.
London critics, however, do not
share these beliefs.' They said the
Germans had gained positions of
such character that a; withdrawal
would certainly be marked by ter
rible losses. They think the Ger
man crown prince will risk all on one
more grand assault against Verdun
before admitting defeat ' "
German newspapers, which printed
lengthy stories about Verdun when
the fight began! now devote small
space to It. Neutral ' publications
have been Jprced to rely on Paris ac
counts that' the Germans had been
checked. ' '. " . ' ' " . ' '
.The last German attack on Fort
de Vaux and the town ot Vaux, said
the Paris' communique',' begaV with
bombardment Tuesday." vThe"shel-
ling "continued all'daiy.' At dawn.tj
when" the slty was Just brightening,.
the first German Iniantrymen crept,
frnm thAl'' tranches "antf ' moved!
stealthily against the French works.,

shells' revealed a dark' mass 'of "men

despatch? "We opened "on them lth

Brigadier-General Pershing's cav
alry Is within supporting distance of
Colonel Dodd's command. They may
possibly effect a junction tomorrow
at Casas Grandes.
From Hachlta, where the United
States troops started, to Casas
Grandes is 100 miles. Funston said
tbe average marching distance of 50
miles a day was one of the finest re
cords of the American army. Small
er picked f orces might have done bet

make that speed over rough desert
Is remarkable. "' " ' .

Paris, Mar. 18. Shelling of Ger
man trenches In Corbeaux wood and
a bombardment around Fort de Vaux
were described In today's official
communique. In other quarters
there was no important activity In
the Verdun region last night
. Almost unprecedented aerial oper
ations were also described. Seven
teen French aeroplanes attacked Con
flans tatlon, through' which ; pass
some of the crown prince's supplies
for the Verdun offensive. Forty
bombs were hurled upon the tracks.
.Another air squad of 14 machines
dropped bombs on the station at
Met. Three llree broke out In the
depot, and there were numerous .ex
plosions along the railway. German
batteries situated .nearby opened a
vigorous Are at tbe flying machines,
which escaped unharmed. ;
A third flotilla sent 10 bombs Into
the aerodrome at Dleuse, and hurled
five more on Arnaville station.
In addition to these .exploits, the
communique said French aeroplanes
made 29 .flights pursuing enemies,
and engaged In 82 sky duels, dam
