I from the French war office mentioned
German troops shifting® southeast of
Verdun. Reports from Paris tonight
I said that the few air scouts who pene

reiterated their earlier statements
that after four weeks of one of the
greatest battles of the war, the crown
prince has decided to quit the at
tempt to take the French citadel.
It was believed possible here that
the troop shifting may be only a re
shuffling process, preliminary to fresh
German attacks.
Even should the Germans have de
cided to abandon the Verdun offensive,
vicious fighting is expected to con
tinue for several days around the
fortress to cover the withdrawal of
troops.
The Ftench and German war of
fices agreed In official statements this
afternoon that no important fighting
occurred last night on the Verdun
front. Berlin attributed this lull to
the heavy fog. This statement was
not accepted by English military men.

American forces.
That the Carranzistas were' In
formed of Villa's whereabouts was in
dicated by the official announcement
from General Luis Gutierrez, gover
nor of Chihuahua, that the outlaw
with 800 men was seen at San Ger
onlmo, (Chihuahua) heading south
for Numiqulpa. In this district, north
west of Chihuahua .City, Villa was
believed to have secretly cached a
quantity of ammunition.
(Reports from another reliable
source also told of Villa nearing San
tana and San Geronimo. His supply
train traveling somewhat slower than
the bandit's main force, has passed
southward through El Valle in the
Guerrero district.
The rumor that Villa was planning
to continue south until he can unite
forces with Zapata was not generally
credited in £3 Paso. Strong Carranza
foroes are between Villa and the ban
dit leader of the south, against'whom
the defacto government today an

Chihuahua's sandy plains. Flights In
the moonlight to seek out the camp
fires of Villista bands were considered
possibilities.
That the Carranza authorities knew
of Villa ammunition at Numiqulpa,
but made no effort to prevent him
getting it, caused no surprise here
as Villa has a strong following in
the Guerero district Men who know
the foxy outlaw, believe he will not
make a stand until he has aroused
the people of the peon class against
the grlngoes and drawn his sympa
thizers. To repeated suggestions that
Mexican bloodshed at the American
expedition hands would again set off
revolution, the defacto co-operation
with the expedition, General Gavira,
today said:
"General Carranza has proved his
ability to control the Mexican people
and his generals have supported him."
Gavira plainly intimated that he
disapproved of the passage ot the
U. S. troops over Mexican soil.
"The restraint our people have
shown," he declared, "is due to their
faith in General Carranza." That this
restraint may burst all bounds as the
American troops enter farther into
Mexico that the first skirmish might
momentarily take place, interest in
the progress of the expedition reach
ed an intense state. Military censor
ship cut off practically all reports.

WASHINGTON, March IS—The bur
den of the expedition into Mexico waB
considered greatly lightened today
when it became known that Car
ranza will permit the United States
army to use the Mexican railways for
transportation of supplies and muni
tions
The fact of the agreement was
learned following consultations be
tween Acting Secretary of State Polk
and Elslo Arrendondo, Mexican am
bassador, designated.
Use of the railways will make a line
of communication certain without any
of the disagreeable and perhaps cost
ly expedients which would have at
tended the use of horse and motor
trains between the line of advance
and the border. It will mean, army of
ficers said tonight, that fewer men
will have to be employed to guard the
line of march, thus giving the advanc
ing line a larger force.
One development of particular sig
nificance was a long conference be
tween 'Secretary of War Baker and
Secretary of the NaVy Daniels. The
situation at Tampico was the chief
topic.
There are hundreds of Americans
and hundreds more followers of other
nationalities there, whose position,
while not critical, is far from safe.
