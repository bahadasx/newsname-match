Jasper Allen was born and reared in
the mountains of Carroll County with
his brothers, Floyd and Sidna. The at
mosphere of his environment was one
of reckless disregard for life, and it
Is said that, although he was a quiet
man, he had more fights than any other
Allen in the county. His boldness and
daring spirit made him famous wher
ever he went. Several years ago ho
and Floyd Allen engaged in a tight,
which nearly proved fatal for both
men. Each was seriously wounded,
Floyd was shot through the breast and
Jasper in the head.
He was the father of Friel Allen,
who is serving a fifteen-year term in
the Virginia Penitentiary for partici
pation in the Hlllsville tragedy.
Whon the Allen clan "shot up" the

another part of tho county, but when
he heard of tho trouble he lost no time
in going to the aid of his relatives.
He remained unconvinced to tho last
in his opinion that the Aliens were "not
given a square deal" by the Virginia
courts.
At a coroner's inquest in Mt. Airy
late to-day a verdict was given Hxing
the. cause of Allen's death as a "bullet
wound inflicted by McOraw." The
latter'. It Is reported, has announced
that he will give himself up and plead
self-defense. Allen will be buried

Mrs. Kngllsh claims that she shot

i President Wilson's attitude as between
th'-!=n two measures, which differ essen
I tially.
j Chairman May, of ihe House Military

j during debate to-day as "the Presl

[ description.
"Doubtless the President favors the

" I may say." he said in reply to a
question, "in broad language that this
is the President's bill; that ho thor
oughly approves of it."
Representative Moore, of Pennsyl
j vania. Republican, said members on
both sides were eager to know wheth
1 er the bill had the full approval of the

! "1 am authorized to state." Chair

i with the approval of the President. It
? is his bill. It carries out the recom
meiuiations of his message. It goes

Mr. Ha\ added that, although the
i bill did not contain the continental
army provision, the President was sat
isfied that the proposed federalization
I of the National Cunrd would accom
plish the same purpose.
Representative Fields, Democrat, of
Kentucky, who opened the debate,
said the one principle upon which all
agreed was "self-preservation and
self-defense."
In supporting the increase. Repre
sentative Smith, Democrat, of New

to obtain men to cope with the Mexi

for improving the national defense.

of South Carolina, said the continental
army scheme had seemed Impractical
to ttio committee, but the bill substi

posal and accomplished the sam?? ob

Ariny and civilian critics of the
present army and of the National
Guard have overshot their mark. Rep
resentative Anthony, .Republican, of
Kansas, said. "I want to say that
what army wo have to-day is the best]
in the world.'* he added. "For its size,
no army in tlio world equals it."
Representative Slierley. chairman of
the Fortifications Committee, said his
seven years' study of coast defenses
had convinced him moro men were
needed.
Representative Mann, minority lead

"It seems to me,' he said, "that this
bill falls far short of what it oucht to
be at this time.
"We are having a little trouble on I
the border of Mexico and are, sending

NKW YORK, March IS.?The. decision
to Increase tho United States Army by

in part of New Jersey, the decline in
enlistments began live or six months

listed in normal times hero has boon
400 to 450 a month. In the last half

total recruits for March would be
about 2.10.

dispatches told of quiet conditions

Mr. Polk also conferred with Kliseo

would discuss their talk, except to say
that reference had been made to a
shipment of munitions the de facto
government Is anxious to get to Vera

A request by General Punstoti that
the American forces bo permitted to

Oflicials here closely associated with the
de facto government are understood to

against granting the request, on the
ground that to do so might arouse

A development regarded in Mexican

EL, PASO. TEX., March IS.?The
first phase of the American espedltlor.
into Mexico?thr. rush along' Villa's dim
trail to tho endangered Mormon col
onies?was an accomplished fact t<>
night, completed, according to reports
reaching- the Columbus base, without
the firing of a hostile shot by the
Americans.
The second phase already was begin
ning, it was indicated here, as the
Americans turned somewhere from neat
Casas Otandes to resume their nigln
inarches toward tho rough mountain
slopes, where it is known Villa alroad.v
has preceded them with more tha>>
100 miles' start.
Warning that this second act in th?
chasc might not pass without flghtin-^
against bandits was implied in a new
and more stringent censorship impose')
at Columbus. Further leakage of
news of military movements, the censor
said frankly to the American press,
would be likely to cost soldiers' lives.
An order was issued holding news
paper correspondents accountable for
dispatched, under the national de
fense act.
There was brief excitement to-day
at Columbus. From across tho Mexi
can border two soldiers on stretchers
were brought Into the American camp.
Both were cavalrymen. Excitement
passed when it was learned that on*
had been thrown from his horse, In
juring his leg, while the other, who at
llrst was said to have been shot In th>^
abdomen, was found to be suffering
from stomach ache.
ME.VACE TO MEXICAN'
XATIOXAI, PRIDE RBMOVB1)
When Washington announced that
tho American columns did not intend
to occupy cities, a menace to Mexican
national pride was removed. The Car
ranza garrisons, which have been
passed by the marching Americans, an<i
which, therefore, are now In the
Americans' rear on their flanks, con
tinned tranquil, so reports to El Past;
indicated.
General Gabriel Gaviria, at Juarez.,
commanding the territory throuel.
which for three days the Americans
have been penetrating, himself an
nounced that for a tlmo the situation
as reported to him had been delicate
and even serious. With evident relief,
he said tho crisis had passed. This
crisis, it Is believed, reached Its height
last night, when couriers dashing Into
Casas Grandes announced with care
less enthusiasm that the American
troops would enter that city by mid
night. General Gaviria wired Immedi
ate orders to his troops not to permit"
this.
Dawn sliowcd tho long lines of
cavalry horses just outside Colonia
Imblan, their troopers dismounted and
in camp, at rest.
VIM.A LOCATED WITH SOME
I1EU REE OK IIEKINITEXESS
Villa was located to-day with some
degree of dellniteness. From several
sources Constitutionalists received
messages, ail of which placed him in
approximately tho same portion of
Western Chihuahua. These dispatches
had him nearly duo south of the Ameri
can columns' present known positions,
and closo to the Sierra Tarrahumare
Mountains. By all accounts, ho is
more than 100 miles ahead of the
Americans, about tho same distanco hf
has been out of their reach for a week,
but with one possibly important dif
ference, that, while heretofore the
Americans have been riding: on a some
what cold trail, they are now nearincr
ground which Villa very recenth
passed over, and where they may have
practical opportunity to test the tempei
of the rural Mexicans, from whom they
might receive valuable, information.
The story that Villa V? gathering
men and preparing to resist was re
ceived in Constitutionalist circles t?
day. and be was even said to have
1,000,000 rounds of cartridges a"1'
shells, many of homo manufacture
secreted in the mountains where h?*
was expected to make a stand. Donb!
that Villa would do any such thing
was expressed, however, by Andrea.-'
Garcia, the .Mexican consul here, who
claimed that Villa intends to mak? the
American expeditionary force h. Joke
Garcia said he was convinced the
bandit had no Intention of lighting
Americans.
"One of my men," he said, "hai
brought me positive information that
Villa is disbanding his men, and In
tends to hide In the mountains with
three or four of his trusted followers
