ELECTRIC WIZARD
SEES SOCIALISM
Or. Charles Steinmetz Thinks
Corporation Forerunner of
New Order.
CO-OPERATION OF BUSINESS
It Was Found Necessary to Reorganize
Industry in Individualistic Eng
land Under War Stress, He
Points Out.
j Philadelphia "A corporation Is a
crude form of socialism. Within the
ranks of the corporation anyone of Its
thousands of employees has more op
portunity to develop than he would in
the employ of a private firm. The cor
poration gives a man a better chance."
These pro-corporation, pro-socialist
statements were made by Dr. Charles
Proteus Steinmetz, the greatest elec
trical genius of the century, while he
was here attending the recent conven
tlon of the Illuminating Engineeriuj
society, of which he is president.
For li.'i years Doctor Steinmetz lists
been chief consulting engineer for the
General Electrical company. P.ut
there's another side of the electrical
wizard, in 1887 Charles Proteus Stein
metz, a student at Breslnu, and only
twenty years old, was forced to leave
Germany on account of his active so
oaustic propaganda. Mow, as an em
ployee of a great corporation and ns
au euthusiustic socialist, Doctor Stein
metz sees in organized business the
modern corporation the beginnings of
socialism.
"The tendency of business today Is
toward co-operation," Doctor Stein
metz said. "Co-operation in business
means the big corporation. Competi
tion is dying out. Through stress of
war the nations have been forced to
practice co-operation within their own
boundary lines. The need was Impera
tive ; the value and benefit of co-operation
is evident
England Forced to Co-operation,
j "In individualistic England there has
been n systematic reorganization of
her railroads, co-operation among her
financiers and big business, all that
the business of war might he carried
on more efficiently.
, "Cooperation, the Incorporating of
Units to achieve better results, is one
form of socialism. A crude one, but
a beginning.
Contrary to the general understand
ing of the crushing despotism of pow
erful corporations of tales of busi
ness men forced out of competition
and of young men mulcted of creative
ideas and thrown on the ash heap
Doctor Steinmetz believes that within
the ranks of the .corporation Is given
to the young man an opportunity such
as he can get nowhere else.
"A corporation will pay more with
less thought of loss," Doctor Steinmetz
sld in explanation. "The private In
dividual must get results and quickly.
He cannot afford to wait one year,
two, perhaps ten or more. Every em
ployee In the small business means so
much money to his firm today. The
Arm cannot afford to wait on the fu
ture. The employee must show results.
The corporation, on the contrary, need
not consider a small loss. It does not
feel It. It can raise a man's salary,
carry him on definitely and give hlra
time to develop his own Ideas. It pays
the large corporation to give Its em
ployees a chance, but the small house
cannot Invest in the future.
Means Equal Opportunity.
"Equal opportunity has been con
tused with ecmality of goods and equal
ity of character," he continued.
"Socialism Is not communism; the
goods of the world will Hot be divided
equally among the people." said Doctor

Certainly not in this day of complex

"Socialism means equal opportunity
Under socialism there will be no ar
ficial distinction. Equal opportunity
will help men to become unequal. Abil
ity and-character will force men td
varying grades of inequality. Today
men are held at a dead level because
opportunity Is withheld from them.
Equal opportunity will be an induce
ment to a man to do his best, It will
evoke his finest qualities; only under
such a condition will men truly be un
equal.
"There will always be leaders,; there
will always be men to be led. There
are men who want to lead, who want
to be powerful. They will find their
piace.
It is natural for some men to want
power. Today in America money Is
power. To be powerful the American
accumulates money. Not for the money
Itself ; a man can use so much and no
more, the rest he works to irlvn nwnv.
The normal man wants money for the
power it brings with It. Only the
miser, the unbalanced man, wunts
money for Itself.
Money Means Power Here.
"In other countries, Itussla nnd Ger
many, for instance, reputation Is pow
er. Equally great minds are attracted
by the power that attaches Itself to a
great scientific reputation or that of n
great artist, an Inventor or a renowned
physician. In the United Stntes, how
evercalled by many the land of
money money alone is power. Here
the most frequent way to acquire pow
er is to acquire money first.
"Under ' socialism the true leader
will be In the right place. Money will
not be necessary; the man with abil
ity will have power."
The labor situation was described
graphically by Doctor Steinmetz.
"Industrial reorganization Is taking
place. AH forces ure working toward
It. The Socialist purty represents po
litical power, the unions Industrial
power.
'Syndicalism, however, I consider a
symptom of labor unrest totally un-
American. The members of the or
ganization are generally foreign, pau
per labor. These men cannot be
reached by political or industrial or
ganization. You will never find a
strong Socialist party or labor union
where the Industrial Workers of the
World Is flourishing.
Only a nation with wide open doors
to Immigrants would have such a prob
lem. It exists nowhere else, except
perhaps in the English colonies. In a
homogeneous nation the problem of
sporadic labor unrest does not exist."
Labor Unions Grow Strong.
Labor unions are growing stronger,
Doctor Steinmetz explained. The So
cialist party is growing stronger. But
the pressure, Indirect, brought on the
other political parties brings about
more socialistic measures than if the
Socialist party were in office.
"Under social democracy," said Doc
tor Steinmetz, 'under the pressure of
the Socialist purty everywhere, the
parties in opposition and in power
have been forced to consider measures
that are fundamentally socialistic. It
is a sign of the beginning. The direct
pressure behind the politlcul parties In
power Is showing its effect. The coun
try Is becoming socialistic, no matter
what party Is victorious. Socialism
Is coming."
So predicts the master mind of elec
tricity, the man who stands head and
shoulders above his fellow workers,
the oracle among them.
