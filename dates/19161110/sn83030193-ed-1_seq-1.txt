A call to tho volunteer firemen of

WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.-March i,
at noon of which day Wilson's term

ho held on Monday. Hut between

the nation will bo legally without an

Hut Secretary of State Lansing said
to-day It wns probably that Mr. Wilson
would take tho oath of office on Satur

exercises of Inauguration on Monday.

Aside from establishing the record

shown by the returns on the popular

popular voto over tho voto of 1912 In
evory Stats In tho union. In 'that
senso ho has tho satlsfastlon of
1 unanimous endorsement of his
policies and achievements. In tho

ried by Hughes Mr. Wilson made
amazing gains In comparison with
the voto of four years ngo.
EXCEEDED WILSON'S VOTE BY
1,331,544.
In 1912 Mr. Wilson's totnl voto was
6,233,120. Roosevelt got 4.119.582 nnd
Taft 3.4SJ.182. The combined Rocse
velt and Taft voto exceeded that of
' President Wilson 1,331,514.
Added to this was the Socialist vote
and the Prohibition vote. As against
all candidates Mr. Wilson wns In tint
minority on tho popular voto about
2,000,000.
Notwithstanding tho Socialist vol
for 1915 exceeds that of 1912 by about
400,000 votes, estimated, Mr. Wilson
succeeded by his personality nnd his
record In overcoming the 1,333,000
lead which Taft and Roosevelt held
In 191! and gathering a couple of hun

about 11P.OO0, President Wilson made
an nstonlshUB K'tln In the popular

he received In 1912.

Announcement Made at National
Headquarters After Consultation
With the Republican Candidate
Wilson Vote in California Grows
and May Reach 5,000
NEW HAMPSHIRE IS SAFE;
GAINS IN MINNESOTA
Willie the Republican National Committee and Candidate Hughes
have not conceded the re-election of President Wilson, they are getting
ready to surrender unless they find something more substantial than the
returns as they stand to make a fight over.
Inasmuch as California and New Mexico have given Wilson sub
stantial pluralities, the Republican leaders see little nourishment in the
prospect of picking a fight in other States where the result Is or will be
close, because even though the count should be In their favor, California
and New Mexico are all that Wilson needs.
Chairman Willcox of the Republican National Committee, after
stating that the official count in California and New Hampshire wouul
be made on Monday, added at noon to-day: ,
"If there is then found any evidence of ballot-box
stuffing of course we shall demand a recount of the entire
State vote. But if the official count in the States sub
stantiates the figures announced last night and there is
no change in the returns of New Mexico and North Dakota,
we will abide by the decision."
Hefore issuing his statement Mr. Willcox submitted it to Candidate
Hughes, who approved it.
The latest teturns indicate that NewHampshire is Democratic by
a majority of 3o8, with six districts to hear from, and witli this State in
the Democratic column President Wilson and Vice-l'resiJent Marshall are
re-elected hy 27o electoral votes.
