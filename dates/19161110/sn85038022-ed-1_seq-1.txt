s.rei'l. I lii- Morning at ait
larij Mimii.
Aliom 1 o'clock this morning the
store of Mr. J. J. Ulngenfelser on East
Second street pas pnrtiuJIy destroyed
by fire. No estimate could he made
as to the total loss but it will In rSTJ
large.
The family were sleeping in the
rooms directly above the Btore. Mrs.
I-lngenfelser was awaken by smoke
fumes. Hastily arousing the rest of
the family they ran down stairs with
out stopping to fully dress. They found
the entire Interior of the store room In
(lames and upon attempting to return
to the upstairs to get their clothes
they found that they were unable to do
so. An alarm was Immediately turned
In and the Kinney Mac responded as
quickly as possible. Mr. I.lngenfelser
had had some headway toward extin
guishing the fire with water and the
firemen finished the work with chemi
cals. The entire interior of the store was
completely ruined. It was indeed for
tunate that no coal oil or gasoline was
stored in the building or disastrous re
sults might have occurred. Mr. Llng
enfelser had just put In a new stock
of canned goods and had fixed up the
store generally. His loss will be verv
great.
This is the second time Mr. Lingen
fclser has sustained a large loss by fin
within the past three years. Recently
he lost a home on East Second street
by lire.

after the polls clotted in California
Republican Chairman Rowell conceded

President a majority in the electoral

column and apparently ended the sus
pense and anxiety of an election which
has been unparalleled In American po
litical history. Kepuhliean Chairinai;
Willcox when informed that the I'resi

plied: "I have nothing to say."

The California results showed that
with only forty-eight districts missing,
the President's plurality in the state
was 2,!70.
Barring some wholly unexpected
turnover in the incomplete states lean
ing toward Wilson or a change on s
recount. California's acquisition to the
fl'inocratlc column gave the President
269 electoral votes without New Mexi
co's three. In New Mexico at midnight.
M President was Lading by 2,6'M
votes, with 158 districts missing, and
it was not believed this advantage
could be overcome by Mr. Hughes.
Itolh Sides Consider Recount
Conceding West Virginia, New
Hampshire and Minnesota to Mr.
Hughes and he wan in the lead in a!"
three only gives him 259 votes, even
less than the required majority. With
ITI votes in sight President Wilson
had six to spare for a possible split
of electors in California or a sudden
r versal In New Mexico. At Republi
can National committee headquarters
it was admitted after conferences be
tween George W. Wickcrsham, Kvereti
j Colby, of New Jersey, Mr. Hughes,
Chairman Willcox and George W. Per-
kins, of New York, preparations were
being made to bring legal proceed
; ings for recounts In states where the
j results were close.
Chairman Willcox included Cali
lurnia. New Mexico, North Dakota,
New Hampshire, and Minnesota in his
I list of states where recounts undoubt
edly would be demanded.
Democratic headquarters was not

In an official statement, the Demo
cratic National committee claimed 272
' votes for President Wilson and a plur

"To say there will be any contests,"
