THE CALDWELL TRIBUNE, NOVEMBER 10, 1916.
WEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR
CALDWELL WINS OVER
iE TEAM IN
FAST GAME
In the most hotly contested game
of the season with Boise, Caldwell
carried away the honors. The two
teams were well matched from the
standpoint of weight. In spite of the
fact that Caldwell's eleven was made
up almost entirely of gren players,
they triumphed over Boise from every
angif of the game. The opening
quarter Boise succeded in getting
away with a touch down through a
fluke on the part of one of the Cald
well men. On account of the illness
of Skelton, one of Caldwell's strongest
back field men, it became necessary
to put a green player into the field
and through his inexperience with the
signals the ball passed into the hands
ot the Boise player on Caldwell's 15
yard line, and he succeeded in getting
away for Boise's only touch down.
Boise on Defensive.
Throughout the entire game Boise
played on the defensive, and were un
able, at any time, to advance the ball
far enough into Caldwell's territory to
be of any danger. Caldwell succeeded
several times in advancing the oval
within about 15 yards of Boise's goal,
where the opponents made a desperate
istawd holding the home team for
downs. The second and third quart
ers continued in a vicious battle up
and down the field with Caldwell
tearing up Boise's line at will, only to
be held for down when getting within
striking distance of the goal. How
ever, in the third quarter being a con
tinual series of line smashes and end
runs the ball was finally put over by
full back Cook for a touch down, but
the attempt to kick goal failed.
Cook Wins Game.
In the last quarter Caldwell ad
vanced the ball to the 30 yard line
where Cook succeeded in a fine at
tempt at a field goal. On the kick off
the ball was rëturned to Boise terri
tory, and by a series of successful end
plays Siebenberg advanced the ball
within striking distance of the Boise
goal again, and Cook made a drop
kick for another 3 more points.
Caldwell Champions.
This game undoubtedly is the de
ciding issue for the championship of
the state. Caldwell has made an ex
cellent showing against all of her op
ponents, so far during the season.
They yet have to face Weiser and
Nampa and it is expected it will re
quire some good hard v?brk to defeat
these teams. The last game of the
season will be played at Ontario on
Thanksgiving Day, when Ontario
hopes to win the title of championship
from the Caldwell team. It will be
remembered that in the early season
Caldwell defeated Ontario here, but
forfeited the game to the opponents
on account of using an ineligible
player. Ontario was unwilling to ac
cept a victory of that sort and has
asked to play for it. It is known that
Ontario boys are working hard- that
they might defeat the Caldwell eleven,
on the 30th., and a large number of
supporters should accompany the
local team on their conquest.
School Masters' Club Entertained.
The Boise Valley School Masters'
Club was entertained at a delightful
dinner prepared by the Domestic
Science department at the high school
building last Saturday ""evening. A
large 'number partook of the feast and
enjoyed an excellent program which
followed. The so-called shortest con
stitution in the world was adopted.
This constitution contains only five
sentences. Speeches were given by
Dr. E. O. Sisson, state commissioner
of education, and Superintendent Rose
of Boise. About 50 guests attended
the meeting. During the dinner the
guests were entertained in a very de
lightful manner by Miss Alberta
Isahm, Miss Margaret O'Connor and
Miss Mildred Lovejoy, who furnished
music.

Results and Responsibility.
Election is now over and to the
winner belongs the spoils. The
Democrats have won all except two
offices on the county ticket. We be
lieve it is best that the decision should
be clean cut one way or the other.
The Democrats are now in full con
trol in the county and the respon
sibility for the success or failure of
the administration is upon them.
The Republicans took a staind
against county division. The Demo
crats nominated a senator from the
Payette valley. Two years ago a
senator from Payette valley created
Gem county. The people have again
expressed their choice and we can
see no reason why Payette county
should be opposed by the people in
Boise valley. Even Parma, the com
munity most concerned, has voted
strongly against her own candidates
who made the fight against division.
The quicker the county is divided the
sooner our troubles will be over. It
is up to the Democrats.
The present board of county com
missioners is the first to refuse sub
stantial aid to the fair. They have
been again elected. The Republican
legislative ticket stood for state aid
for the fair, but they were not elected.
It is up to the Democrats to support
the fair financially if it is to be con
tinued. They represent the majority,
turn it over to them.
The Democratic legislative ticket
two years ago did not support our
experimental farm. It has no money
with which to conduct its experiments,
t is up to the Democrats to take care
of it or abandon it.
For four years we have been trying
to get aid from congress for our
reclamation project. One part of the
project has been trying to adjust its
ccsl for water, the other part to ob
tain funds to get water. Neither has
been successful with or received any
aid from a national Demo^rati: ad
ministration. To former Republican
administrations belongs the credit for
what has been done for reclamation.
The people on the project voted ïo
keep the Democratic administration in
power at Washington, even the pres
ident of the Black Canyon project and
the president of the Settlers' asso
ciation numbered among its support
ers. Our Republican Senators and
Congressmen caninot get aid from an
unfriendly administration, yet the peo
ple benefitted have not tried to assist
them with their vote.
What are you going to do about it?
The answer is up to the mapority.
GHALFANT JOINS
COLLEGE OF IDAHO
Dr. Charles L. Chalfant, former pas
tor of the First Presbyterian church of
Boise, and superintendent of the
Children's Home Finding Society of
Idaho, will become financial secretary
of the College of Idaho of this city.
Monday Dr Chalfant tendered his
resignation as superintendent of the
Home Finding Society to take effect
December 1st.
The resignation of Dr. Chalfant was
accepted by the board of directors of
the Home Finding Society with great
regret. As state superintendent he
had given great satisfaction to the
board and the general public.
Will Raise Half Million.
In taking his new position Dr. Chal
fant is given the task of raising the
sum of half a million dollars tor the
college and will be obliged to divide
his time between Idaho and New
York. For nine years he has been one
of the trustees of the College of Idaho
and during his residence in Boise has
been president of the Boise Minister
ial association!, president of the Anti
Saloon league and vice president of
the Associated Charities.
Letter of Resignation.
Dr. Cluilfant's letter of resignation
to the board of trustees is as follows:
'I hereby resign the office of state
superintendent with the request that
such resignation be effective Nov. 30,
1916.
"In taking this step I wish to ex
press to you all my hearty apprecia
tion of the unanimous and hearty sup
port given me by the directors, the
society, the employes of the society
and indeed by the citizens of the
whole state.
"The caring for the homeless chil
dren of a great state is an important
task and when I accepted this posi
tion it was with the purpose of mak
ing it a life work. But a call has
come for me for service in a field that
is just as needy and where I can in
vest my time and effort more effec
tively to the glory of God.
"Not that I esteem this work un
worthy or lacking in the elements that
make it clearly God's own work, but
while the undertaking to raise a half
million dollars for a Christian college
is not an easy one, it is a needful one
if the cause of Christian education is
to succeed.
"If there is more important work
in Idaho than that done by this so
ciety it is the work done by the Col
lege of Idaho, of which my friend
our honored fellow citizen. Dr. W. J
Boone is the distinguished president
a college which through a quarter of
a century has been giving to the
young men and women of our state
a liberal education under Christian
auspices and which stands today in
the front rank of the educational in
stitutions in this western land."

WILSON CARRIES IDAHO
BY ABOUT 15,000
The Republicans in Idaho elected
their two representatives in congress,
Smith and French, probably Eagleson
for state treasurer, Miss Redfield for
superintendent of schools and Bell for
inspector of mines.
The Democrats elected Alexander
governor, Walters attorney general,
Parker, lieutenant governor, Van Deu
sen auditor, Dougherty secretary of
state.
Rice is elected justice of the su
preme court over Dunn. The two con
stitutional amendments carried by
handsome majorities.
Returns Slow Coming In.
The returns from the state are slow
coming in. It will be several days
before the exact results are known.
President Wilson has carried Idaho
by upwards of 15,000 votes. Goxer
nor Alexander has probably carried
the state by 2500. The other candi
dates on both state tickets were
elected by small majorities. Smith
and French, Republicans for congress,
were elected by about 6000 votes.
A heavy vote was cast throughout
the state. The Democratic landslide
was a great surprise to the observers
of both parties. The Republicans ad
itted all along that Idaho was
doubtful but expected to carry it
through for Hughes by a smaJl ma
jority. The Democrats publicly
claimed the state and privately ad
mitted it was doubtful.
Surprise in Southeast.
Among the surprises sprung elec
tion day was the landslide in the
southeast which carried to defeat John
Hart and Nathan Ricks, Republi
can warhorses of that section. The
Mormons in Idaho and Utah and other
estern states east their vote per in
structiors from tihe church authorities.
They fell into line for Wilson not
withstanding their Repubicanism of 50
years' standing. Qne of the two
states that went for Taft in 1912 went
for Wilson in 1916.
The Idaho legislature will be Dem
ocratic this year, for the first time in
15 years. The Democratic landslide
swept into office the county offices in
nearly every county in the state. The
southeast was no exception to the
general drift of public sentiment in
this state.

Noel Lcavett was the center of
jolly surprise party Wednesday even

dozen guests, most of them friends of
Noel from Pleasant Ridge, his former
home, spent the jolliest kind of an
evening together. Taffy, games, re
freshments and the proffering of good
wishes to the young host kept the
company pleasantly occupied until a

DEMOCRATS MAKE AL
MOST CLEAN SWEEP
In Canyon county the Democrats
elected their entire county ticket ex
cept their candidates for prosecuting
attorney and county surveyor. Mr.
A. F. Stone, the Republican nominee
for prosecuting attorney, was elected
by nearly 1000 votes over H. A. Grif
fiths, the Democratic nominee. Mr.
Guy C. McGec, Republican, was
elected over Mr. Ogden Dutchcr,
Democrat, by nearly 500 votes.
The Democratic majorities in Can
yon county range from 2013 for Mrs.
Sarah J. Handy down to defeat for
county candidates. John W. Eagle
son. Redfield, French and Smith
were the only candidates on the Re
publican state ticket to carry the elec
tion in this county.

Organ Recital.
Caldwell music lovers are delighted
with the resumption of the monthly
organ recitals which they had come
to regard as a sort of institution, but
which have prolonged their vacation
period a couple of months later than
usual, long enough, perhaps, to guar
antee a keen relish for their monthly
reappearance during the winter.
Sunday's program was an excep
tionally strong one, and was in Pro
fessor Beale's best style, which is say
ing much. The vocal numbers by
Miss Devies, Nampa's popular con
tralto, attracted a delegation from the
neighboring city, and were much en
joyed.
These music feasts merit the sup
port as they never fail to gain the
appreciation of all who believe in the
uplift of good music.
Indian Skeleton Found.
Three Caldwell boys made a curious
find Tuesday while crossing Snake
river abbut two miles below Froman's
Ferry. The lads were Frankie and
Angus Monroe and Henry Jones.
They were crossing the river in a
boat when they noticed a long bone
exposed in the precipitous bank of an
island toward which tlvey were
moving. On examination, it proved
to be the skeleton of an Indian, no
doubt the burial place of some noble
red man years ago. The body had
evidently been interred about three
feet under ground, and the water had
gradually washed into the grave, ex
posing one side of the skeleton. Un
der the chin was found a knife, and
the handle of another knife was found
with the blade rusted off. Other ar
ticles in the grewsome find were a
peace pipe, and one smaller pipe, part
of an arrow shaft, four arrow heads,
a piece of chain less than a foot in
lenth, and some small lumps of a
peculiar red substance supposed to be
Indian war pain.
Only part of the skeleton was in
tact, the rest having bee.n washed
away by the water. The boys car
ried away the skull and one knee cap,
but stacked the remaining bones in a
pile on the island.
A notable feature of the find in this
day of faulty teeth, is the fact that
but twb teeth were missing in the
jaws. The boys are to be congratu
lated upon this curio discoverey
which recalls to pioneers their early
day experiences with the red man.
JUDGE KING URGES
II
The council chamber at the city hall
was crowded Thursday afternoon with
land holders under the Boise project
who were anxious to hear Judge Will
R. King, chief counsel of the United
State reclamation service, on the ad
visability of forming an irrigation dis
trict.
A preliminary talk was given by
Project Manager Cole who advised
the organization of a district as a pre
liminary to doing business. Two rea
sons were given for such organization,
one that the project is worth the
price, the other that the law requires
it. The argument of excessive cost
was met with the statement that the
construction work on the project is of
a permanent rather than a temporary
nature, and a distinction was made be
tween the preliminary and the final
estimate, the latter being the basis
upon which the cost is estimated.
Judge King acknowledged his intro
duction in a most happy fashion,
stating that since Jordan Valley had
been his home from 1878 to 92, dur
ing which time Caldwell was his near
est trading point, he really felt quite
at home.
With characteristic directness, the
Judge launched at once into an inter
esting maze of facts and figures. In
the three years that he has been in
the position of chief counselor, he has
traveled between 75,000 and 100,000
miles in the interests of irrigation.
He left Washington, D. C., in October
and will not return until December.
Each projects has its owrn difficul
ties, dependent upon soil, climate, alti
tude and other conditions.
The government is not a corpora
tion—not a speculator—but an agent
of the people who oay for the building
of the projects. The government as
sumes the responsibility of construct
ing, pays for such construction work
without interest, except that of criti
cism pro and con, and allows the land
owner twenty years in which to pay
back the principle. The Judge insisted
that the cost of production was often
misunderstood, and instanced a case
where land at a cost of $75 or $80 per
acre would, if the actual outlay be fig
ured, amount to not more than $35 or
$40 under the twenty year extension
plan.
In speaking of the movement to cut
down the price of irrigation projects,
Judge King rapped the secret organi
zations working to that end roundly,
and named the Strawberry Valley
project as well pleased with a con
tract at $80, and projects in North
Yakima satisfied with a still greater
cost per acre. The Reclamation Act
specifies that settlers must pay for
the actual construction of the project
and public notice of the estimated cost
of the Boise project will probably be
issued before January, 1917, such cost
under the present acreage to be be
tween $78 and $80. If other available
lands are taken in, this cost will be
reduced at least $10 per acre. The
debt cannot be repudiated: not good
business to attempt it. The plea that
rivers and harbors are benefitting
is
with public funds not tenable. Those
are public highways, while the owner
of a farm U monarch of all he surveys,

Late last evening the results of the

doubt. The indications are that
Hughes is elected. The results are
very close. California, Minnesota and
North Dakota are still somewhat in
doubt but the latest returns show
strong Republican tendencies. If
Hughes carries these states he is
elected easily. Hughes will have 272

FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH
Pastor to Continue His Sermons Upon
the Book or Revelation.
Bible school will meet as usual on
Sunday morning at 10:30 o'clock with
classes in their respective places and
every scholar on time with a studied
lesson. Everyone is invited to be
present.
Regular worship at 11:30 o'clock.
The pastor will use as the subject of
his theme "Heroes in God's Hall of
Fame." This sermon is a continua
tion of the series announced some
time ago. No doubt all will be pleased
to hear the pastor next Sabbath morn
ing.
B. Y. P. U. meets in the east room
of the church regularly each Sunday
evening at 6:30 o'clock. As the clos
ing days of this official administration
is drawing to a close it is the desire
of the president that a goodly number
turn out each Sunday evening for the
next month and a half. Committee
chairmen will please note that the
executive board will meet on Monday
evening, November 13th. Please come
prepared with written reports stating
the work done for the past month.
Evening worship at 7:30 o'clock.
The second lecture on the Book of
Revelation will be taken up. This is
truly mysterious book and in the
present day and age ought to avail
ourselves of every opportunity to
learn its contents. Come out and hear
the pastor expound this book of
books.
Prayer-meeting on Thursday even
ing at 7:45 o'clock. A very vital
question is now being considered and
every member of the church ought to
present themselves at the "Power
House of the Church."
Personals.
Mrs. Geo. R. Varney, wife of the
former pastor of this church, now re
siding at Phoenix, Arazona, was a
week-end visitor with several of the
ladies of the church last week. Mrs.
Varney stopped off enroute from
Baker City, Oregon, where she had
been to visit her son and family. The
longing to see her former friends in
Caldwell induced her to return home
via Salt Lake so that she might have
the opportunity of visiting at least a
part of the time with them. An in
formal reception was given in her
honor last Friday atfernoon after
which she was taken over the country
for an automobile ride. Mrs. Varney
left last Saturday morning for her
home in Phoenix with the love of her
former friends of Caldwell still rest
ing in her soul.
