ON ELECTIL
OF YOUNG Hi
IN COURT
Little Tommy Seaton Has Mania for
Grabbing Fair Feminimity
CAUGHT BY VICTIM'S ESCORT
Bennington's "Jack the Hugger"
Proves to Be Lacking in Both
Size and Courage.
' .
Thomas Seaton, aged 13, a former
inmate of the industrial school at
Vergennes this noon admitted that
he has been responsible for the sever
al attacks on young women and girls
that have occured in the village dur
ing the past month. Later develop
ments may prove that he is not tho
one to blame in every case but he has
admitted that he committed one at
tack and in another instance he was
caught in the act.
The boy's arrest last night followed
an attack on a young woman as she
was passing through the graded
school grounds following the en
tertainment at the opera house,
At the time the young wo
man was accompanied by her mother
and a young man but the older woman
and the escort were some distance bo
hind. When Seatou seized the young
woman by the arm she screamed and
ran over School street to Main in
search of an officer while the young
man took after Seaton. The young
man proved the better runner, over
took Seaton on the west side of
School street and later turned him
over to Officer Hurley who had been
summoned by the young woman.
Seaton was arraigned before Muni
cipal Judge E. 11. Holden this fore
noon und at first made an out and out
denial, lie said that he accidentally
hit the young woman while passing
her on the. walk. Three of the young
women who have been annoyed were
summoned to court as witnesses but
all stated that they were too
thoroughly frightened at the time to
say positively that Seaton was their
assailant.
After court adjourned at noon,
Chief of Police Brazil and Officer
Richard Hurley began questioning
Seaton and tho boy finally broke down
and confessed. He is not at all ac
quainted with any of the young wo
men and was unable to positively
identify mere than one, ' but enough
information was gained to convince
the officers that they had brought the
career of "Jack the Hugger" to an
end.
Information gained from Seaton led
the officers to believe that the boy un
der arrest is not the only one who has
been Implicated in the annoying at
tacks. Another youth of about the
same age. who has also been an in
mate of tho industrial school, is under
suspicion and will probably be
brought into court during the day.
Seaton is an undersized boy who
will be 19 years old on the 14th day
of this month. From Information
gained from him by the officers this
noon it Is apparent that he is afflict
ed with a sneaking mania to get his
hands on young women and girls, but
the fact that In every case his Intend
ed victims escaped without even a
struggle would indicate that he does
not posses sufficient courage to make
him more than on annoying nuisance
that should be abated.
BUSY CAY IN COURT
Several Petty Offenders Arraignea
Before Judge Holden
E. H. Holden held a busy session of
municipal court this morning. The
pioceedings opened with the case of
Reuben Levin, an itinerant peddler
from Troy who was charged with at
tempting to do business In the village
without a license as provided by the
ordinances.
Inasmuch as the peddler culled at
the house of the chief of police, he did
not have much of a defence. Accord
ingly he pleaded guilty and was fined
$10 with costs of $5.00 which he paid.
Levin was followed by four men,
only one of them a resident, who were
charged with Intoxication. All plead
ed guilty und were fined the custo
mary amount. One of the men was
posted and when asked where he se
cured his liquor disclosed on Wal
looinsac. Two of the quartette were arrested
by Officer Hurley following the break
ing of the j) lat( glass postcard case
and plate glass window at the Evans'
news room on Main street. The
breaking of the window and case is
not bedleved to have been deliberate
but was due to the condition of the
two young men at the time of the oc
currence. They have arranged with
Mr. Evans to pay for the case, which
was valued at 1-10. Moth are em
ployed on the Everett farm. The
window is probably insured against
accident of this nature.

Many Humorous Features of long
Uncertainty v
LOSERS HATED 10 GIVE UP
Much More Betting Than Usual in
Bennington Added to the Intensi
ty of Interest.
When a batter knocks a Texas
leaguer with the score tied, and races
home with the crowds cheering und
the bauds playing, only to have the
"ump" tell him he failed to touch sec
ond - - - - when a presidential nominee
has a large majority in the, electoral
college accorded him, only to find that
a number of states carelessly went to
bed on the night of election and did
not count ballots until the next day
and he is not elected after all - -
when the man who bet on Hughes
collects his money, and spends it - -only
to have to dig down deep and pay
it back - - "it don't seem right.'
On November 7 this county elected
a president and until Thursday after
noon no one knew which it was. It is
a safe bet to say that never before did
100.000.000 people keep a secret so
Well. Men who claim that "there is
nothing new" admit that they are
astounded, politicians versed in the
game and hardened to its vagaries,
say that they cannot understand it;
no one can satisfactorily explain how
Hughes was elected and was not elect
ed. The reports early on Tuesday
night of a Republican landslide were
so sure; state after state sending re
turns in favor of Hughes, even the
"southern part of Texas," as one cf
our local "Honorables" assured every
one, being Republican, were so indi
catives of a "cinch" for the bewiskered
candidate, that It looked as if there
were "nothing to it." The Democrats
lay low, wept some and said little, not
being able to comprehend their op
ponents' cock-s,ureness. But. even
they were mostly willing to give in, a
few of the in even paying off their wag
ers. And on Wednesday morning there
was a different story; neither Hughes
nor Wilson was fleeted and from thtn
until Thursday afternoon Hume Rumor
held full sway. States have hopped
from one colum into the other and
back again and havo then been listed
as doubtful, returns which were uni
versally accepted have been entirely
leversed; later bulletins and still later
dieted earlier bulletins and still later
bulletins have called both of them
liars; It was even spread about that
Governor Whitman cf New York was
not re elected.
Newspapers offices where returns
were received were the rendezvous ot
adhcients of both parties; business
men would rush in breathless and hat
less to inquire whether some new
story were true or not; knots of poli
ticians gathered at the street corners
and discussed the situation ; and the
office telephone rang all the time. The
office force wished to put the returns
on a record and run it continuously
ior if the rush had continued much
longer either tho phone bell or their
throats would have worn out. On
Tuesday evening and even Wednesday
morning one might expect to receive
an avalanehe inquiries over the wire,
but to have it continue two days long
er, made one wish to muffle the bell.
It was interesting to watch the crowd
in the Banner office; every time the
phone would ring every neck would
stretch, every eur would strain, and
when they heard "why, it is doubtful
as yet," back every one would sit and
breath a deep, resigned sigh.
For a village of this size, it may be
safe to say that never before in its
history was tlmre so much betting.
There waB .very little money placed
on either side last week, but beginn
ing Monday, and rising to its highest
Tuesday noon, and continuing until
last night, enough money was wagered
in Bennington to make one al
most believe that two dollar
wheat and tea dollar coal
was a myth. At first the Republi
cans gave slight odds, ten to eight be
ing tho terms on Monday, coming up
to ten to nine Monday night and early
Tuesday, and even money sluce then.
Besides bets among local men and the
innumerable small amounts wagered,
nearby towns In New York and Massa
chusetts made up "pools" and sent
them here, all cf them being promptly
covered.
It wus certainly a freak election.
As the Brooklyn Kagle remarked:
"Wilson kept us out of bed."

Kditor of tho Banner: In looking
over some old pictures, I found one

be of interest to some eif your read
ers'. The small two story white frame
building on tho right, was occupied
by Biadley & Squires, jewelers. The
next store, a two story brick building,
was formerly occupied by Serlno W.
1'ee k, druggist. He was succeeded by
J. T. Shurtltff. The adjoining store
in the same building, was formerly
occupied by Asbury Golden, merchant
taller, afterward by Charles Thatcher,
dry goods, and at the time the picture
was taken the first floor was occupied
by Nelson Wiie'ox and his cousin
Henry Bibcock, as a boot and shoe
store. J. A. N. Williams, had a har

next bulding was formerly occupied
by Bradley & Squires and afterward
by Charles Hawks as a dry goods

privilege of buying a suit of clothes

and boarded at home. My experience
in the Godfrey store, recalls two inci
dents that stand out vividly in my
mind. I was drawing a gallon cf mo
lasses in the cellar and left it "just
for a moment" to go up stairs and
wait on another customer. When I re
turned the barred was just where I
left it. but the contents covered the
cellar bottom. At another time, . I
was carrying a large Danby cheese up
to the first tloeir. 1 could Just reach
around the box, and when I reached
tho top of the stairs, the bottom of
the box fell out and you can draw on
your imagination, ns to what hap

Seme Electors of Both Parties May
Be Chonen.
Sacramenlo. Cal., Nov. 9. Be
cause of the closeness of the contest
between President Wilson and
Chiules K. Hughes in California, Sec
retary of State Jordan predicted late
today that there is likely will be a
split in the state's electoral vote of
thirteen.
Jordan was so sure that some of
both tho Republican and Democratic
electors will be chosen, that he al
ready has decided to ask both parties
to delegate representatives to be pres
ent when the official count Is made.
The count probably will start a', out
next Thursday, after the Beml-ofliilal
canvass has been made by tlv lotin
ty boards of surpervisors.
Jordan says there is no provision of
law lor a recount where the rxmtests
for president ial electors are close,
congiess relying; upon the , oitnicii
titni by 1 he state's chief executive of
the count made by the secreta;.. of
state.
In 1912 two Democratic lectors
were chosen In California with eleven
Republicans Griffin, Democrat, win
ning over .1. W. Finney. Republican,
and Dalvalle. Democrat, beating M. A.
Line. Republican.
There are several other cases in
tire history of California where presi
dential elections have been so edoso
us -to split the electoral vote, Jordan
points out. This occurred in ixso,
1S92 and I8!'.
WILSON'S VICTORY
HOT ill DANGER
BY RECOUNT
Unless It Should Affect State of
California
HIS SUCCESS APPEARS DECISIVE
Still Few Returns to Come In But
Enough Available to Make the
Outcome Certain.
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 9. Call
fornia has given her electoral vote to
Woodrow Wilson.
The Republican Chairman, C. H.
Rowell, admitted at 8.25 o'clock to
night that "tarring some exceptional
errors in the count the President had
carried the State.
Mr. Row-ell conceded the State af
ter reviewing returns showing a plur
ality of 2,970 for Wilson, with only
forty-eight s(.'attered precincts of the
f.8"0 in the State not complete. These
figures were: Wilson, 465,194;
Hughes, 402,224.
These returns ehowed forty-two of
fifty-eight counties in the State com
pleted. In all but ten counties in the
State returns had been back-checked
and corrected. The possibility of er
ror was thus reduced to a minimum.
The figures from 5,823 of the 5,870
precincts are Hughes, 402,289; Wilson
405,254. This makes ilson s plurali
ty 2,905.
St. Paul, Minn.. Nov. 9. Three
nights of unofficial canvassing have
failtd to take Minnesota from the
doubtful column of the Presidential
race.
Charles K. Hughes maintained a
slight lead over President Wilson
throughout today, the standing con
tinued so close that politicians of both
parties declared tonight that only the
official count would settle the contest.
When returns had been received
from 2.940 precincts out of 3.024 In
the State. Mr. Hughes had a plurality
of C72, the count standing; Wilson
175.558; Hughes 176,230. The pre
cincts yet to report there numbered
84.
Kxcept for President, Minnesota de
livered Its customary big Republican
majority, as shown in the pluralities
of Governor Burnquist and Frank R.
Kellogg, candidate for the fnited
States Senate. Republicans also were
uniformly successful on the rest of
tho State ticket.
Farge). N. D., Nov. 9. North Da
kota's live votes In the Klectoral Col
lege were conceded to President Wil
son late tonight by William Lemke,
Chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee, when returns
from all but thirty-three precincts in
the State gave the President a plurali
ty of 1.500 over Hughes.
Returns from the scattered outly
ing districts trickled in all day. The
reports from 1.826 precincts out of
1.859 in the State give Wilson 54,308
and Hughes 52,748.
Chin leston, W. Va., Nov. 9.
Hughes was leading Wilson in West
Virginia by 4.014 votes tonight, with
1H9 precincts to be heard from the
total vote being: Hughes, 135.976;
Wilson. 131.902. During the last
tw-enty-four hours Hughes continued
to maintain a. lead In the neighbor
hooel of 2.000, and early tonight when
remote districts began to come in the
vote for him was increased.
Santa Fe, Nov. 9. Four hundred
and eighty of 638 precincts in New
Mexico give Hughes 29,251, Wilson
31.8S5.
These are revised figures received
from county clerks. These also in
clude precincts in all but one of the
twenty-six counties. Returns of the
forty-seven precincts in Socorro coun
try, the cle'rk annotiuced, had been
locked In the ballot boxes. The clerk
of Roosevelt county, twenty-seven pre
cincts. gave no figures but announced
that Wilson had carried the county by
425 Socorro and Roosevelt counties
were not Included in the 480 precincts
tabulated.

New York, Nv. 10. Woodrow Wil
son and Thomas R. Marshall have
again elected President and Vice
President. Soon after 11 o'clock last
night all the doubtful States, except
New Hampshire) and Minnesota, had
given Wilson such a steady lead that
his election was no longer in doubt.
When at 11.25, the news came that
Chester R. Howell, the Republican
State Chairman in California, had
conceded the State to the Democrats,
the disputed election of 1916 was no
longer in dispute.
Wilson's indicated vote in the Elec
toral College is 272. that of Hughes
being 259. With 272 votes in sight.
President Wilson has six to spare for
a possible split of Electors in Califor
nia, or a sudden , reversal in New
Mexico.
Yesterday morning the States la
doubt were California and North Da
kota, in which Wilson was leading by
small pluralities; Minnesota and New
Mexico, in which Hughes was leading
by still smaller ones. Later in the
day New Hampshire, which had been
given to Hughes, became doubtful, and
New Mexico swung over to the Wil
son column.
After that the only hope of the Re
publicans was In California. which.
Hughes must carry. In addition to
Minnesota. But the California re
turns, as they kept on coming in, on
ly served to strengthen Wilson's as
surance of the State. He did not gain,
much, but he did not lose, and with
every new return the hope of hearing;
from senne Hughes stronghold which
would overturn the Wilson plurality
became fainter. When the southern
part of the State was nearly all on
record, and had failed to cut Wilson
down any further, while the northern
part confirmed his plurality, it became
certain that California had given the
Democrats the victory in the nation.
All the news of the day was Wilson
news. The hack settlements of New
MexM, which were so long coming
in. reversed Hughes apparent lead
when they did come, and turned over
to Wilson by what, for that sparsely
settled State, is a large majority.
Hughes lost nothing in Minnesota,
but the hope of a change in North
Dakota was not realized, and the
dwindling or his plurality in New
Hampshire until the Democrats wero
claiming the State was the finishing
blow.
