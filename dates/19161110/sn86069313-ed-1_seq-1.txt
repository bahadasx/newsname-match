Late last night both Democrnts
nnd Republicans were claiming the
elcc'iun of their respective candidates
for the Presidency of the United
States and It now appears tlmt an of
ficial count of tho votes, especially
in tho doubtful States, will he neces
sary to determine tho winner. It
may be several days, therefore, until
it Is known for certain who will bo
tho next President.
Meanwhile campaign managers for
both Hughes and Wilson stoutly
maintain the election of their candi
date The Kast and North has gone
for Hughes while the West has lln
(i up, in most part, with the solid
Squtli for Wilson. At press hour
lust night California was still in the
doubtful column. Wilson got a ma
jority of about 4,000 in the San
Francisco section, but tho Republic
ans, expect this to he offset from tho
Los Angeles secttou.
West Virginia, Oregon, Now Mex
ico and Minnesota, which were class
ed as doubtful States, early yester
day morning swung Into tho Hughes
column during the day. Hughes
seems to bo In the lead at present
and should ho got cither California
or North Dakota his election would
be assured Should Wilson get both
of these States It would re-elect him
to the presidency.
With tho eloctorlal vote of Califor
nia added to his column Hughes
would have a total of 275, or nine
more than necessary to elect.
Wilson must get both California
nnd North Dakota, two doubtful
States, to he elected. Ho would then
Tjiave 2C9 electorial votes, or three
nrare than necesbury.
From any angle It Is a "boss race"
and the public may be prepared for
ii swing in olther direction whon tho
official count Is taken.

TIIK PROSPECT IX SOMK
CLOSE STATES.
Now York, Nov. S. With tho coun
try's choice of a President tn the al
most unprecedented status of doubt
on the day after election, both Dem
ocratic nnd Republican headquarters
were scenes of nervous nctlvlty and
tension. Although both sides claim
ed majorities In the Electorial Col
lege, thero seemed nevertheless to be
a feeling at both places there was a
chance that tho determination of the
final result with so many States
doubtful might bo prolonged perhaps
for another day and thero was sonio
unolllclal talk that the decision might
eventually bo thrown Into the House
of Representatives.
Thero wero suggestions also that
thero might bo in sotuo States bitter
contests over the integrity of tho re
turns, which might bo drawn out for
days, with tho result depending on a
count. Oeorgo Perkins, at Repub
lican headquarters, commenting up
on tho close voto In sonio States, de
clared that a recount might bo ne
cessary. Chairman McCormlck ear
ly to-day sent telegrams to every
State and county chairman where the
result appears close, commanding
them to "personally seo that tho bal
lot boxes are guarded and protect
ed." At both headquarters tho long-dl3-
18'tanco telephones are busy with or
ders to the respective chairmen lit
tho doubtful States to watch tho
count and tho returns wero being
closely scrutinized. .

Presidential Race.
Ohio county retained her position
In tho Republican column Tuesday
when sho rolled up a majority of 559
for Hughes and 627 for Haswell. Al
though tho result was about as ex
pected by Republican leaders some
precincts gave unexpected reversals
ono war or another but not enough
to have telling effect upon the ma
jority. Democrats conceded the
county In advance by near 300. Has
well, however, was expected to re
colvo at least 200 more votes than
Hughes.
The first precinct heard from Tues
day afternoon was Pt. Pleasant, tho
home of Chairman Condlt. This pre
cinct gave a Republican majority of
two. It is normally Democratic.
Fordsvllle and Roslne gave tho
largest Republican majorities. Fords
vllle giving 146 .while Roslne, the
Eleventh District of Ohio county,
gave tho O. O. P. 207 out of 281
cast.
McHenry was the greatest surprise
to Democratic followers, who had
figured tho vote close In that pre
cinct. The Republicans polled 128,
while Wilson's electors received 46
in the mining city. Simmons also
threw cheer Into the Republican
camp and the result there as In prac
tically all of the precincts shows hus
tling on tho part of the committee
men. Narrows lined up in the G.
O. P. column this year. Hughes and
Haswell received the same voto In
that precinct.
The Socialist, Prohibition, Social
ist and Progressive voto of the coun
ty will not bo known until after the
official count to-morrow. Tho same
is true of the voto of A. D. Kirk,
successful candldato for tho short
term of county attorney. Kirk hnd
no opposition but he is expected to
receive a good complimentary vote.

ALL OLD TOIIACCO IS

Paducah, Ky., Nov. 6. Tho old
stocks of tobacco in Paducah have
been sold. No Bales wore reported
from Mayflold tho past week, and
thero remain only ubout 100 hogs
heads of old tobacco thero In first
hands. Theso aro good common to
medium leaf, held at prices ranging
from 9 to 12 conts.
Weather for tho past weok 'has
been cool and fair and tobacco In
tho barns is dry, consequently there
hns been very little movement of the
crop. A few loads have been sold
on tho streets in Mayfleld. Some
fair quality of the weed has de
veloped in these first deliveries. So
far the sales made on tho Mayfleld
streets have been to local dealers.
Large Interests have not entered the
market, but preparations are being
made for all buyers to enter the
competition. Farmers are anticipat
ing high prices, but thero have not
been sufficient demands to establish
values.

Chicago, Nov. 8. Carl D. Thomp

day said:
"In 19-12-the Socialist -party polled
900,000 votes'. This election the re
turns show that we have polled about
1,200,000. Whllo this gain of the
total vote cast by our party is not as
great as wo had hoped for, we aro
satisfied with the general result.
"We believe we have elected about
thirty-five members of the Legisla
tures In twenty-one States. In Min
neapolis we elected our candidate for
Mayor, Thomas H. Van Lear. In
Milwaukee we appear to have elect
ed tho District Attorney and per

"In California we elected two
members of the State Legislature '
In Wisconsin two Socialist candidates
for State Senator and five or seven

LICAN CONTROL RESULT OP'

SENATE TO BE REDUCED
Result Depends On New Mexico's
Cbolco For Keproentatiie In
Upier House.
New York, Nov. 9. Altho the
Democrats are assured control of the
Senate by a working majority, coa-r
trol of the House was still In doubt
at an early hour to-day. The Dem
ocrats had made slight gains, how
over, In ,tho late returns in Mantana
and Kansas. At 1 o'clock, 205 Dem
ocrats, 201 Republicans, 2 Progres
sives, 1 Socialist and 1 Independent
had been elected with twenty-five
congressional districts yet to be heard
'from.
Of twenty-five districts yet to Ie
heard from, seventeen are represent
ed in the present Congress by Demo
crats and thirteen by Republicans.
Should these districts be unchanged
'the next House would be com posed
'of 216 Democrats, 215 Republicans,
and four scattering who might elect
to affiliate with either side.
Tho Senate will remain under Dem
ocratic control by a reduced major!'
ty of ten or tw.elve,'dependentwon thee
outcome In New Mexico, "whoro A. A.
Jones, Democrat, is maintaining o
slight lead over Frank A. HubbeeL
nominated by the Republicans to suc
ceed Senator Catron. At this hour
tho Senate stands:
Democrats, 53; Republicans, 42;
undecided, 1.
In the Senate four present Demo
cratic members, according to the la
test indications, have been defeated.
They aro Senators Kern and Tag
gart, of Indiana; Martlnc, of New
Jersey, and Chilton, of West Virgin
la. Three Republican Senators, Lip
pitt, of Rhode Island; Clark, of Wy
oming, and Sutherland, of Utah, al
so have lost their seats on the baste
of returns.
The defeat of Senator Kern, of In
diana, by Harry S. New, former chair
man of tho Republican National Com
mittee takes from the Democratic or
ganization its floor leader. Among
Democratic Senators mentioned for
the succession are Sau'sbury, of Mon
tana, and Underwood, of Alabama.
In yesterday's election tho Demo
crats elected sixteen Senators and tho
Republicans sixteen, with one State
yet to be heard from.
