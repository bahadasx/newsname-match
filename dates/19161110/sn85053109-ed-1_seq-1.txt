Death Calls Lee
Barrington Today
Community is Plunged In
Sorrow Over His
Sudden Call
A pall of sorrow hangs over
the community this morning,
occasioned by the death of Lee
Barrington, at his home south
of the city, at 1:30 o'clock.
Last week the Pioneer Press
told of his illness, due to an in
jury. An operation was per
formed and the patient recov
ered very rapidly: so rapidly
that his physician. Dr. Nelson,
considered him wholly out of
danger. Wednesday evening
his nurse. Mrs. Keenholts, no
ticed that he was ill at ease and
breathing heavily. Dr. Nelson
was summoned and found that
he had contracted a case of
pneumonia. He sank very
rapidly from that time. Thurs
day morning the physician des
paired of recovery and rela
tives living elsewhere were
summoned. His wife, father,
mother, brothers and sisters
who reside here were at his
bedside when the end came.
The community has suffered
a great loss in the death of Lee
Barrington and a young wife,
parents, brothers and sisters
have been plunged into the
deepest grief by his untimely
taking away. Exemplary in
all his acts as a man and citi
zen, devoted to home and fam
ily ties, inil'istrii'vs and suc
cessful in his worldly affairs, he
was a young man whose life
was an inspiration to others
about him. To the stricken
relatives the Pioneer Press ex
tends its sincere condolence in
this time of affliction.
At the time this was writ
ten no funeral arrangements
were made. Relatives from a
distance are expected some time
today and after their arrival
plans for the burial will be
made.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilbur Baird and
little daughter left last evening for
Indianola, III., where they will
spend most of the winter, visiting
at thoir old horiie. A six-year
old daughter of the Bairds is now
attending school at Indianola and
Wilbur states that he and Mrs
Baird could not reconcile them
selves to spending the winter here
under the circumstances.

Elevator Nearly Ready
The Equity elevator is rapid
ly nearing completion and Man
ager Fox states that it will
open to receive grain early
next week. The elevator will
cost a little more than $8,000
and is thoroughly modern. In
connection with the splendid
elevator is a large warehouse
and flour and farm machinery
will be placed on sale in this
warehouse. The sheds of the
Northern Montana Lumber Co.,
on the railway right of way
have been purchased and the
Equity will handle coal in these
bins. The society members
are confident that they will do
a very good business in all the
above lines as soon as supplies
can be procured, the great
drawback at present being
shortage of cars.
Good Service
The Cut Bank Telephone Co.
gave the public splendid ser
vice on election night. The of
fice handled the returns from
state and county in a verv ef
ficient manner and kept them
tabulated as they were receiv
ed, for the information of the
eager local politicians, most of
whom kept vigil through the
night, at the republican head
quarters and elsewhere.
Completely Remodeled
The Great Northern hotel is
undergoing a complete remodel
ing, on both the exterior and in
terior. It has been raised to
grade and placed on a more
firm foundation. The hotel and
its surroundings have not u<!d
ed much to the scenery in the
lower part of the city, but now
the good work of renovation is
on and a fresh coat of paint on
the outside, a good walk on the
east side and other improve
ments will be made that will
enhance the appearance of
Lower Broadway.
Chas. Peterson and C. W
Bailey were in from the De
niers section Wednesday and
Thursday. Both finished thresh
ing recently and report fine
flax yields. Bailey's flax yield
ed about 20 bushels to the acre
and his total flax crop was
1300 bushels. Peterson's flax
yielded about 24 bushels to the
acre.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Brown
and baby are guests of old
friends here. Harry, who is
employed as boiler maker in
the railway terminal at Judith
Gap, states that the crop in the
Judith was light this year, the
yields being far below those of
this section.

Presidency is
Up In the Air
WILSON H AS SHADE THE BEST
OF IT WITH SEVERAL
DOUBTFUL STATES
With Minnesota conceded to Hughes and California
leaning strong toward Wilson at last reports, with several
smaller states still running close, the presidential race at
time of writing is the most spectacular in the country's
history. The whole matter may be thrown into Congress
for ultimate decision and a number of state contests seem
certain. At this time Wilson seems to have the better of
it, but at any time the situation might undergo a change.
All is speculation and uncertainty.

On Tuesday
Stewart Wins Over Edwards
Myers Appears to Have
Beaten Pray
and
With county returns all in, late this afternoon, the ex
citing race for county treasurer was decided, when three
missing precincts gave the victory to A. B. Guthrie, the
republican candidate, by 45 votes. One of the most pleas
ing results to local republicans was the election of John
Barnett, who was opposed by his opponent in the primary,
Colin Ward. They were hoping that LaValle, the demo
cratic candidate, would be elected if the fight became one
between Ward and LaValle. This was certainly a demo
cratic year in Montana and Teton county was helped by
the drift, but in spite of this the three local candidates,
Harry Putt, M. A. O'Niel and Mrs. Bowman, went down
to defeat. The Pioneer Press had intended giving a more
complete report but returns have been very slow in com
ing in.
The County Ticket
(Tribune Special)
Choteau, Nov. 8.—With only
three precincts to hear from,
Teton county gives a majority
for President Wilson, but only
four democrotic county officials
were elected. The one receiv
ing the largest vote was Captain
Walter Verge. During his ab
sence with his company at the
border, his wife made a very
strong campaign in his behalf,
and it is generally conceded that
a large part of his success is
due to her extraordinary ef
forts.

State Goes Dry
By Decisive Vote
Dry Sentiment Swept the
State State Tuesday
Like Snowslide
The politician who ran madly
after the "dry" bandwagon at
the close of the primary cam
paign had the right hunch.
Montana has voted out the
saloon by an overwhelming
vote. The vote is greater, per
haps, than in any state where
the issue has come to the fore.
It is a spectacle that almost
makes one dizzy to contem
plate. But yesterday the east
ern magazines were pointing
to Montana as "the wettest
state in the Union." where the
saloon was so strongly entrench
ed that nothing could budge it.
Tuesday the voters went forth
and laid it low.
But the saloons have a lease
of life until December 31.1916,
nearly two years—unless the
triumpant "drys" decide to
invoke county option in the
different counties that have
gone dry decisively. In that
event the saloon would have to
go as soon as it was voted out.
But as the Pioneer Press
senses it, the commonsense and
just view of the matter would
be to allow the saloons the
time alloted, to close out their
business and seek new lines of
endeavor. It is neither just nor
chivalrous to hit a man when
he is down. Let us be fair with
the vanquished and give them
a chance to close out their
stocks in due time and plan to
engage in other vocations. Per
haps they themselves will be
thankful in time that the
change has come.
In Toole County
In Toole county the fight was
hot. the democrats putting over
four candidates; clerk, treasur
er. clerk of court and superin
tendent of schools. Republic
ans gained the office of repre
sentative and county attorney.
The hi? fight was on surveyor
and Ralph Buckner won over
a democratic and two independ
ent candidates. The county
was carried by the 'drys.'
Young Mr. Goss
Browning Review: Saturday
is the Eightieth Birthday of
Frank Goss. The occasion was
celebrated by a surprise party at
F. Goss' home when a large throng
joined in the heartiest congratula
tions to the oid pioneer. Mr. Goss
had around him an immediate fam
ily circle of ten children and fifteeu
grandchildren. There are few pio
neers whn can boast of a family of
thirty-six members.
Mr Goss landed at Fort Benton
in 18Ö0 and during the years since
then has seen (he buffalo supplant
ed by herds of cattle.
After the general congratulations
were over, dancing was the order
of the evening, and Mr. Goss »'as
amongst the best in "tripping the
light fantastic toe."
Mr. W. Sharpe and X. Bille
deaux who are also pioneers of
many years, standing seized the op
portunity to swap yearns.
The lteview wishes Mr. Goss
many happy returns of the day;
we hope we will see many years of
health and prosperity in our midst.
There will he a meeting of the
Parent-Teachers Association next
Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock.
All who are interested in the work
are iuvited to atteud.
