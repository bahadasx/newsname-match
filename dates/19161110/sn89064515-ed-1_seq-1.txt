LOCAL FOOTBALL SQUAD COPS
LAST GAME OP SEASON,
19 TO 0
Our high school boys closed the
season in a glorious manner, trimming
Anoka on the local grounds by a score
of 19 to 0. The game was
not one-sided but the local
boys had the edge on the
A ris-
itors throughout the entire game.
This victory gave the locals a
record of four won out of five games
played. They lost to St. Cloud three
weeks ago.
The first quarter1 in Tuesday's
game was uneventful but in the sec
ond Little Falls got its first touch
down. They had worked the ball to
Anoka's ten-yard line and fumbled it
there but the fumble was recovered
by Grimes and Levin crossed the line
for a touchdown. Tannqr kicked
goal.
In the third quarter the locals
made another touchdown, when Dob
byn made a sensational run around
Anoka's right end and planted the
ball safely on the other side of the
line. Tanner missed goal.
The last touchdown came in the
fourth quarter, on a forward pass.
Norman Elvig carried the ball over
the line. Tanner again missed goal.

Wilson
Wilson has apparently won the
presidency in the closest presidential
contest since the Tilden-Hayes elec
tion of 1876.
Democratic state headquarters claim
his election, crediting the president at
this writing with 266 electoral votes,
266 being sufficient to elect.
Democratic papers are claiming Wil
son's election and republican papers
are leaning to same opinion.
North Dakota and New Mexico
which have been in the doubtful col
umn have swung over to Wilson, as
well as California, although it is
possible that the vote may be split,
but with Wilson receiving the larger
part. New Hampshire is also claimed
by the democrats, but it is also claim
ed by the republicans as the vote of
both parties seem to differ but ft
couple hundred. In Minnesota Hughes
is leading by the slender margin of
806, with 100 precincts missing. There
are still to be counted, however, the
votes of those not casting their ballot
at home, such as the trainmen, the
traveling men, and the National
guard men at the border. It is confi
dently expected that by these men will
be cast a strong vote for the presi
dent, the vote of all them likely total
ing six or seven thousand.

INDIGNANT OVER CONDITIONS,
AGAIN ENTER COMPLAINT
A regular monthly meeting was held
by the city council Monday evening,
Aldermen Moeglein, Blake, Falk,
Johnson, LaFond ami Farrow being
present. Vice-president Moeglein
acted as ichairman in the absence of
President Hall.
John Vertin was granted a permit
to put a fire-proof roofing on the
building occupied by the Dow print
erv.
City Clerk Schallern read a com
munication from the Water Power
company stating that they desired to
withdraw the proposed ordinance for
the extension of the electric lignc
franchise. The clerk stated that he
had already returned the proposed or
dinance to the company.
Geo. Kaye, Mr. Bredfield, Mr.
Knuth and one or two other farmers
from Little Falls town appeared before
the council and registered complaints
about the ondition of the city dump,
which is located' near the main road
about two miles south of town. They
stated that dead horses had been tak
en down there and left umburied and
that rubbish and manure had been
dumped near the entrance to the dump
and even outside of it. Mr. Bred
field, who is a member of the town
board- of Little Falls, stated that the
council's attention had been called to
the matter on a number of occasions
but that the conditions now are worse
than ever. He said that the town
board has the power to condemn the
dump as a nuisance but that they
do not wish to take such narsh steps
if the city will make an effort to keep
it more sanitary. He suggested digg
ing a trench and having all waste
dumped into the trench, and when it
becomes filled up it could be covered
up and another trench dug. The
councilmen were of the opinion that
the dump should be looked after and
Street Commissioner LaFond was in
structed to go down there and clean it
up and to examine it occasionally
hereafter and see that dead animals
are properly buried, etc.
Four petitions against the proposed
light rate, one from each ward in the
eity, containing in all over two
hundred signatures, were presented',
but were not read as a special meet
ing w^ll ibe called for the purpose of
bringing up the light reports and
hearing these petitions. The petition"
ers suggested a rate starting at 6 cents
for the first 30 kilowatt hours, instead
of 8 cents for the fifst 20 5 cents for
the next 30 instead of 6 cents for 20
to 40 and 2 cents for all over 60 ln

gested a minimum of 50 cents per
month.
Alderman Johnson reported to the
council that he had asked for prices
for the rebuilding of the West side
bell tower and that he had received
an offer to put up a 40-foot steel tow
er, with 10-foot girders, for $71.00 and
a similar tower with 5-foot girders
for $76.50, all complete. The price for
the timber for a wooden tower, he
said, would be $57.48, and the cost of
construction would bring the wooden
tower to about $150. The council de
cided to get the steel tower with the
5-foot girders at $76.50. Alderman
Johnson was given power to have the
tower constructed.
COMPLAIN ABOUT CITY DUMP BOARD Of EDUCATION MET
A. D. Harrison made a proposition
to the council to sell a crusher head
for the stone crusher to the city tor
$35. It cost $48 when new and was
said to be in good condition. Street
Commissioner LaFond was authorized
to buy it.
An ordinance pmending the ordi*
nance establishing the widths of side
walks and boulevards on Broadway
west was instructed by Alderman
Johnson. This ordinance was drawn
up in
OTder
to make the boulevard on
Broadway from Third street on 14
feet, instead of 9. The ordinance in
cluded some parts of the street and 01
other streets which were considered
unnecessary and City Attorney Camer
on -said that they could be eliminated.
The ordinance was therefore laid over
until these changes could be made.
The property owners had started to
put in their curbs but the delays caus
ed them to drop the work and they
will not be finished until next spring.
Street Commissioner LaFond was
instructed to look after a ditch on
Sixth street southwest which has
been filled up in one place as a result
of people driving through it with
rigs. He was also instructed to notify
the Realty Improvement company,
which owns the lots at the corner of
Broadway and Second street- north
east, to put in a railing, along the
sidewalk. Alderman LaFond stated
that the wire fence along that walk
was torn down in several places and
that it was dangerous. The street
commissioner was also instructed to
see that a railing is installed along
the ravine on the same street, from
First avenue north to the Methodist
church.
