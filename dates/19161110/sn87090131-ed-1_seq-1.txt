THE COLONEL'S LAST STAND.
N THE night of January 10, 1664,
I just before retiring to his virtuous
couch, Samuel PIepys wrote the follow
ing in that diary of his, which was
destined to become world-famous long
after his death:
"All our discourse tonight was about
Mr. Tryon's late being robbed; and
that Colonel Turner (a mad, swearing,
confident fellow, well known by all,
and by me) one much indebted to this
man for his very livelihood, was the
man that either did it or plotted it;
and the money and the things are
found in his hand, and he and his wife
ate now in Newgate for it; of which
we are all glad, so very known a rogue
he was."
Col. James Turner was the sort of
man you read about In historical nov
els. A swaggerer and ruffler, with his
hand ever upon his swordhilt. and his
eye quick to read offense ih a look or
a smile. He was a great drinker and
gambler and spent his evenings in the l
inns, where he kept the varlets busy
drawing sack. In his day he had been
a mighty soldier and had demonstrat
ed that he was a brave man upon sev
eral fields. He had made a hit with
King Charles, too, for he was a man
after the king's own heart. He was
humorous and jovial, and had no re
spect whatever for the moral law. }
The colonel had many false friends,
and one true friend. Whenever he was t
ii
I `
8o the Colonel Began to Talk.
In financial troubles, which was pretty tl
often, he could count upon the asslist- o
ance of Mr. Tryon, a benevolent ancient fl
man of wealth. Tryou never refused o
him money, but didn't hand out as I:
much as the colonel thought was nec- t
essary. Mr. Tryon's mind ran on shil- a
lings, while that of the colonel ran on "
pounds. In those days, as in our own it
times, the man who makes a business b
of high wassail needs a large income,
und the colonel's embarrassments grew i I
and multiplieL lie realized that a ti
gooid haul was necessary to get him out e
of his difftticulties. The idea of robbing a
Mr. Tryvon at once occurred to him. Of d
course it was rather mean to pillage b
a man who had befriended him so r
much. but no gool business man allows
sentiment to interfere with commerce. hI
So it happened that on the night of E
January 8, Mr. Tryon woke from a
"eep dream of peace to find a huge
masked tigure bending over his bed.
The figure held a lanthorn in one hand, ci
and a horse pistol, about the size of a ni
hitching post, in the other. While this sc
intruder stood guard, a second robber ,t
ound the old man cruelly and gagged li
aim. lie was trussed up so tight he i ft
had great difliculty in breathing. .1
Leaving him in this shape, the maraud- nz
'rs runsnacked the lpreamiscs and carried c
away $5.A00 in money, and Jewelry to iII
he value of $Sa.000). After two or tr
hree hours of misery. Mr. Tryon man- 1l
aged to free himself of the g:lg, and pa
Felled so shrilly that the night a
satch canme to his relief. sc
The roboery remained a mystery for
ibout twenty-four hours. It happened
hat Mr. Tryon had a friend. an alder
iran, who was fond of sleuthluing, and yc
his alderman soon traced the crime to I
Lurner, and recovered the money and d,
lewels where that gallant warrior had g'
aidden them. And as Pepys intimated,
he robbery was the talk of the town,
mnd continued to be for ma ay a long
lay. It was one of the first Important
aurglaries in the criminal annals of sc
@ngland ,.
) The jaunty colonel took his imprison.
ment calmly. TIhere was no loophole
in thei case again-t him, and he knew
he must be convicted, but he also knew
Ithat his friend, the king. would never
Itt him hang. Why, ;:adzooks, Charles
was like a brother to him. Nay, nay,
said the colonel, to those who tried t9
bring home to him the dangerous po
sition h.' was in. lite had a good friend
at Wh\'litehall who would save him.
In due course the colonel was con
victed and returned froml the court
I room to his cell. As the hours went
by. and the day of doom approached,
the colonel's serenity was diminished
in some degree, but he was still con
tideut. Ili' knew that Charles had a
weakness for putting everything off to
the last mlinllte. Also, his majesty had
a fondness for dramatic effects, and it
would be just like him to wait until
the last moment before issuing a par
don or a reprieve. The jeering turn
keys suggested that the king had for
gotten him, but he knew the king bet
ter than they did.
The day of execution came and the
scaffold was erected in the street. All
of London was there to see what they
might see. Pepys records that he stood
on the wheel of a cart and was much
cramped. The scaffold was a primitive
affair, without modern comforts or
conveniences. It consisted of a plat
form and a beam overhead, from which
was suspended the noose. That noose
having been adjusted about a doomed
man's neck, he was pushed overboard.
In those days it was the custom to
allow condemned men to talk as much
as they wanted to, and the condemned
seldom abused the privilege. They
usually made a few stereotyped re
marks, asking all and sundry to profit
by the example before them and then
passed out.
Colonel Turner appearet upon the
scaffold bravely arrayed, with a broad
brimmed plumed hat upon his head.
lie was a fine figure of a man. lie
was escorted by the sheriff, the ordi
nary (chaplain) of Newgate, the hang
man and that functionary's first assi~t
ant. He looked long and earnestly In
the direction of Whitehall. No doubt
he expected to see a man on horseback,
i forcing his way through the crowd,
bearing a reprieve. But there was no
such horseman. But the colonel's faith
In his friend, the king, was firm. All
he had to do was to stave off the pro
ceedings until his majesty's messenger
came.
So the colonel began to talk. He had
a fine voice and knew how to use it.
Had he lived in our day, he'd have
been on the chautauqua circuit. He
told the story of his life from infancy
to the current hour. He told of mov
ing adventures and hairbreadth es
capes, and the great crowd cheered
him. When he had talkeid for an
hour the sheriff tapped him on the
shoulder and told him he was abusing
his privileges. It was time to get
down to brass tacks, said the official.
The colonel gazed again, perhaps
somewhat despairingly, in the direction
of Whitehall, and saw no horseman
coming. He wiped some cold sweat
from his brow, and then turned in and
roasted the sheriff to a delicate brown;
then he took up the prison system of
England, and showed that it was out
rageous. He contrasted it with the
system of the Low Countries and of
Spain, to its infinite disadvantage. lie
discussed this subject for an hour and
a half, and the crowd seemed to be
with him. But the ordinary was grow
ing impatient. So he stepped up to
the colonel and hinted that it was
quite rude to delay the proceedings
after that fashion.
The colonel turned once more toward
Whitehall. No horseman! One can
look back 250 years and see the trou
ble in his haggard face. Had the king,
then, forgotten him? He would hold
out a little longer. So he turned in
andti jacked up the ordinary, and all
the race of ordinaries, back to the time
of King Alfred. The little chaplain
fairly shriveled up in the blast of his
oratory, and the crowd yelled with de
Itght. So the cololenel talked, and
talked, until the shadows grew long,
always with the corner of his eye to
ward Whitehall, and all in vain. At
last the sheriff and the hangman would
be put off no longer. And the colonel
was so hoarse he coulcl say no more.
lie had talked for six hours. A beau
tiful woman was gazing upon him with
eyes wet with sympathy. "Your serv
ant, mistress." said the colonel, as he
doffed his hat. Sond a minute later his
body was whirling at the end of a
rope.
The king, who had been playing with
his spaniels all afternoon, laughed
,heartlly when he heard the story.
Fealty of Partners.
A member of the New York suprem
court, reproving a New York tirm of
architects for canceling an agreement,
says: "Authorities unanimously agree
that there is scarcely asy relation in
life which calls for more alsoclute good
faith than the reldtion of partners."'
A.\lso, "A purer and more elevated mtf-r.
ality is demanded of partners than the
ecmnmon morality of the trade." The
tmeaning is that an ludividual who
transacts busintess for himself may
liok out solely for himnself, while a
partner must never consider his own
advantage apart from that of his as
soclates.
Generous.
"What has become of that dog of
yours ?"
"Oh, he got so vicious that it was
dangerous to have him around, so I
gave him to a friend of mine."
Immune.
"Is Bliggins a pessimist?"
"Not exactly. He can make othere
so gloomy tl.ey can't eat, but he sel
dom falls to enjoy his own dinner."

A T LAST I have discovered a
country where the war is al
most unknown, where normal
conditions reign, and where
life is going on just as it has for the
last 2,000 years, unmoved by what is
passing over It, writes Montgomery
Schuyler to the New York Times.
Not easy of access to foreigners at any
time, Russian Turkestan, since the be
ginning of the war, has been a terra
incognita to the traveler, and so far as
I am aware I was the first to visit it
since that time. The country is always
under military rule and since its an
nexation by the Russian empire has
been administered as a military ter
ritory by the war office. Through the
necessary ofi1cial channels I obtained
permission to visit Turkestan, accom
panied by my wife, and started off
from Petrograd in the middle of a
snowstorm with intense cold and every
evidence of midwinter.
We arrived after some five and a
half days' steady traveling at Tash
kent, the administrative capital of Rus
sian Turkestan.
This is a new city built by the Rus
sians after the occupation of the neigh
boring districts between 1865 and 1868.
It is laid out in the manner of all new
Russian places, with wide boulevards
radiating from a center as planned and
running straight out into the country
an empire, as nowhere else, the peo
. ..
through fields and swamps, looking
confidently to the future for the growth
and population to come, for in the Rus
sian empire, as nowhere else, the peo
ple follow the flag, and, indeed, some
times precede it in this part of the
world.
Tashkent is obviously and unmistak
ably a city of the future, and allow
ance must he made for its present
straggling character. There are, how
ever, many handsome administrative
buildings and military and educational
establishments.
Beautiful in Early Spring.
Turkestan is now reached from Pe
trograd and Moscow by railway via
Orenhurg to Tashkent. or across the
Caspian by steamer, a sea trip of only
about 36 hours from Baku to Krasno
vodsk. The most interesting way to
go is as we did, out by Tashkent and
hack through Krasnovodsk and Baku.
At Tashkent I was joined by a Rus
sian otdicer. who had been detailed to
accompany tle on my travels in Turke
stan, and who proved to be not only
a charming companion, but of great
help in arranging the details of the
ollrn4'y tlunl in getting the necessary
transportati"u and accommodations.
We had already begun t, fes the
rc•milng of spring after leaving the Ural
iltountluils near l)renhurg, and as we
lmed or rathier crawled south and east
the snow disappeared and the sir be
-ame milder and balmier until as we
utpped out of the train at Tashkent
e- were in the full glory of the early
rspring. There are few loveller sights
than the comining of spring after the
lamp and unpleasant winter of Tur
kestan. There is hardly ever any wind
.n Tashkent. and the calm day after
lay is curious to the stranger within a
is gates. The rain and warm weath
pr rapidly bring on the vegetation, and i
eon everything is.covered with a dell
nate green, which blends with the pink
ad l.rwn mud walls. tne clear blue
if the sky, and the glittering gold and
.ellw of the Russian Orthodox
church edifices.
From Tashkent we started on a de
tour of Kokand, seeing en route the
fertile cotton fields of the Ferghana
and Kokand districts, of which the
city of Skobelovo is the administra
tive center. This town also is new
and without interest. Some miles
away is the old and ruined city which
it has replaced. whose crumbling mud
walls and deserted streets bear wit
ness to the power of the railroad to
draw people to itself.
Dead Age is Revitalized.
Prom Andijan, near the border of
Chinese Turkestan, the Transcasplan
railroad stretches to the port of Kras
novodsk, on the shore of the Casplan
sea, a distance of more than 1,100
miles, but the portion between Kokand
and Andljan is without Interest for
the traveler except for occasional
views of snow-covered mountains on
the Chinese frontier. But on leaving
Kokand for the trip to the Casplan,
we leave the newer cities of the Rus
sian occupation and enter regions of
old civilization and historic and
archeological interest. After a dusty*
journey through unwatered plains we
reached the old and delightful city of
Samarkand, known to all students as
one of the outlying seats of Greek cul
ture. The present town of Samarkand
is the third city to be erected on prac
tically the same spot, although the old
est Greek settlement was laid out per
h:ps three miles from the present site.
There is little to be seen of the place
now except bricks and outlines of
buildings covered for the most part
deeply in the sand which had drifted
and blown over them for so long.
Bazaars Are Interesting.
But it is not alone for its memories
of the past that Samarkand Is Interest
ing to the traveler. There is a busy
but always sedate and grave business
present in the city. and a stroll around
the bazaars Is full of surprises. The
streets of the native town are only
just wide enough for one carriage at
a time, and traffic would be greatly
blocked if there were more than a
very few horse-drawn vehicles in the
city. As it is, nearly all freight and
farm products are brought in on cam
els or on donkeys. The latter are the
same sturdy, gray, and intelligent lit
tie beasts seen throughout the East
and in Mexico and South America.'
They take their duties solemnly and
refuse to be distracted by noise and
confusion. Whole processions of the
little fellows pass through the narrow
ways or stop to be unloaded in front
of the shops, which are nothing more
than platforms built at the side of the
street and surrounded with shelves for
merchandise. Some of the streets in
the bazaar are so narrow that they
are like corridors in a building and
are covered from the houses on each
side by arched roofs, so that one can
walk around and keep dry even in the
hardest rain.
On all sides there sit, gravely sip
ping their endless caps of tea and
eating sweetmeats and dried fruits, the
dark-faced merchants, many of them
with long beards dyed red and with
green turbans, showing that they have
made the long holy pilgrimage to
Mecca. The brilliance and charm of
the scene are extraordinary. Men and
women are clad in long. flowing -owns
of the brightest silks In startling but
always harmonious comblnatlons-yel
low, red, blue, and green.
Not Infrequently the little streets
are dwarfed by the appearance of a
long string of camels bringing huge
bales of cotton or the heavier kinds
of freight from the country districts.
These animals are picturesque, but so
stupid and vicious that they have to
be tied in a long line with one of
the intelligent little donkeys in front
to show them where to go.
The next city of importance on the
line of the railway on the way to
Krasnovodsk Is Bokhara. The old his
oric town is some five miles from the
railroad, with which it is connected
hy a branch line and by one of the
worst carriage roads I have ever been
ver.
New Bokhara or Kagan is the seat
f a Russian polical agent, who Is

rument at the court of the emir of
