official count. New Mexico returns
not complete but looks like Jones,

The big outstanding feature of the
returns was the fact that the repub
lican candidate' carried' the states
that have the big electoral vote, ex
cepting only Ohio. Mr. Wilson ap
pears to have increased the . dema
cra tie strength of the Bryan can
paign of 190S, but the democratic
hopes of getting a large slice of the
progressive vote of 1912 met w'th
crushing disappointment, not only
in the east but in Indiana, Illinois
and Ohio.
At the outside the democrats did
sot get more than 20 per cent on the
HEARQ4tverare " progressive vote or
of four years ago. Hughes carried
Pennsylvania by an estimated, ma
jority of 200,000 votes in spite of
Chairman McCormck's warning that
the Keystone state would fumah a
"surprise." Some of the other in
dicated state majorities were as fol
lows: Indiana 60.000, Illinois 60,
000 to 100.000 Wisconsin 60.000
New Jersey 96,000, Michigan 20,000,
Connecticut 12.000, MaasachuseU
20,000, West Virginia 8,000, Iowa
20,000.
As the battle for the senate stood
at ISO the dem√≥crata appear to nava
60 seats and ta republicana 46. The
biggest surprise was the indication
that rockrlbbed republican Rhode
Island had elected a democrat, Peter
Goelet, Corry, In place of Senator
Lippitt. The defeat of Senator Su
therland, republican of Utah and the
probable defeat of Senator DuPont
of Delaware, with the Rhode Island
surprise, offset the republican gains
of one each in New York, New Jer
sey, Ohio, Nebraska and two in In
diana. On the other hand Senator
Clarence D. Clark of Wymoning,
whose defeat had been feared by the
republicans because of the strength
of Governor John B. Kcndrick, was
re-elected.

some of the states that still are class

Charleston, W. Va. Returns from
382 precincts out of 1,713 in West

cxecu'iv offices at Aahury Park,
N. J., with their hopes slowly rising
as more complete returns from wist
ern states arrived. President Wilson
who retired lata last night, was ut

Aumulty and other member of the
president's official family believed
this morning that the president had
been re-elected, they issued no state
menta. The president expected to
remain almoKt constantly at Shadow
Lawn reading retrun.
Butte, Montana In Montana, 284
precincts out of 1239 give Wilson
33,979, Hughes, 23,672.
New York In claiming the re
election of Wilson, a statement was
made at democratic headquarters
the president could lose both Cali
fornia and Minnesota and still be
elected. A statement issued at re
publican national headquarters at
2:30 this afternoon, claimed Minneso
ta, Oregon, California, and New
Hampshire and asserted that Hugh
es had obtained 277 electoral votes.
Trenton, N. J. Hughes' plurality
in New Jersey at 3 p. m. was fully
39,665. The total vote with 267 dis
tricts missing gave Wilson 180,326,
Hughes, 219,934. Earlier returns
which appeared .to give Hughes,
when 462 districts were missing a
plurality of only 9.196 proved to be
an error when a revision of the fig
ure was mad. Hughes' plurality
at that tima was 37,148.
New York Attorney General
Gregory went into conference with
Chairman McCormick at democratic
headquarters this afternoon. No
statement wasmade as to the sub
ject of the conference but reporta
were current that the question of
investigating the count in New

es was under consideration.

E. Hughes over Wood row Wilson In
Michigan mounted to nearly ove

plurality was constantly growing
and republican leaders 'claimed he
would carry Michigan by more than
40.000. Returns from 1.0U5 precincts

E. Hughes in this state by a plurality
which, when the returns are all In,
will be somewhere between 800 and
1,000. The returns received late this
afternoon fro mSan Miguel and Mofcf1
counties, indicating that the repub
lican pluralities in those counties will
be greatly reduced even mora than
was counted upon by the dem√≥crata,
may result In the state giving the
Wilson and Marshall elector even
more than 1.000 plurality.
Practically the only uncertain fac
tor in the state as it now stands la
the fact that nothing pproaching ex
act returns have been received from
the normally strong republican coun
ties of Taos and Rio Arriba, but in
viw of the slump reported from San
Miguel and Mora counties it is hardly
to be expected that the two counties
named can return a large enough re
publican plurality to ovrecome the
lead that Wilson has in th rest of
the state.
Repuhlirsns Disappointed
From almost every republican
stronghold comes reports that are
disappointing to the Hughes follow
ers. Bernalillo county, which was
expected to give a Hughes plurality
of from 800 to 1,000, went republican
by only about 300. Colfax, formerly
atanchly republican, appears to have

big plurality for the republicans has
been held down to about 150 for
Hughes. Mora seems to be almost
an even break. Sandoval ia claimed
by both sides by about 100. Santa
Fe is almost a stand-off.
! The nearst approach to a realiza
tion of republican expectations, so
far as present returns are concerned
is reported from Dona Ana, where
the republicans are reported to have
a lead of slightly more than 400,
Val√≥nela, which i believd to have
gone republican by about 1,300 and
Sororro, where the Rumim follow
ers claim for the republican candi
date for governor by 1,000. Taking
this estimate as correct, however, it
Is altogether likely that the Hughes
vota in Socorro county will be con
siderably less than for th favorite

On the Other Hand.
Democratic counties on th other
hand, have about come up to the ex
pectations of th party leader. Th
Pecos Valley may run a few hundred
I short of th figure set by th enthu
'sissts from that section, but though
not as deep a a well nor a bread as
a church door, Indication ar that
th vote from that part ox the state
will be enough for all practical pur
poses. i Grant county ha given Wilson
somewhere between 600 and 700 plu
rality and Luna about 600, while
Quay ha exceeded all exception by
rolling up a plurality of 800 or more.
Neither Union or San Juan coun
ties normally strong democratic conn
tie, have been heard from, and it is
practically certain that they will go
fur to offset any big figures that
may be reported from Taos and Kin
Arriba counties. Sierra county ha
shown a slight slump from what was
expected of it, the Wilson plurality
in that county being only about AO.
Interest in the content for state of
flees has been almost swallowed up
in the greatest interest in the race
for president and few figures are
available as to how those contests
are proceeding. There is reason to
believe that Jones will run uhead of
the ticket, but by how great a vote
can not be foretold at this time.
Walton appears to he running about
with the presMentinl tickt. De Baca
is running behind the ticket in the
earftern part of the state but ahead
of it in the nothern tier of counties,
so that it is likely that he will fin
ish sbout even with Wilson and Wal
ton. As to the minor state offices it ia
almost impossible to hazard any
guess. Only one county, Curry, has
turned in complete returns, and there
as was to have been expected, all
th dmocratic candidates had sub
stantial pturalitia, Harry L. Patton
leading the ticket.
Th beat guess at thia tima is that
Wilson ha carried th state and that
Jonea, Walton and De Baca are elect
ed. A to th other offices the can
didatea and their supporters will hav
to wait several days until the vote
are all counted.

That Francisco Villa asserted he
could take Juana with two hundred
men within four days, hut had no in
tention of doing so since it would
probably cause the American troop

tion mad by th bandit leader. This--report
was made Ust night by a re

The refuge also said Villa ha in
structed his men not to molest Am
ericans. In view of th fact that
foreigners have been killed by the
Villistas, and one American, Dr. C.
II. Fisher, recently lost his life at
their hands in Santa Rosalia, the re
port is discredited.
A body of Villitas is said to be
moving toward Nirves, ' Duranita, 35
milen southwest of Parrnl, where a
large drove of horsex, urma and am
munition are known to be hidden for
the Villa forces. These were hid--den

It was in the direction of this ranch
that Villa wan gong when he waa
