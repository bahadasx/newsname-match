After considering the matter carefully and after receiving encouragement from citizens from
all parts of the County, I have definitely decided to enter the race for superintendent of schools.
;I attended the public schools and have taught in them for a number of years and I understand
the trials, problems and needs of the boys and girls all over the County; and also of their parents
who are striving hard to give their children an education. I am a graduate of the Eastern Kentucky
State Normal School and hold a life diploma from that instutation entitling me to teach any where
in the state. I have taken special work at a number of summer schools and last July I received a
State certificate. I believe that all applicants for this ottice should secure the qualifications sufficient
to meet the legal requirements, at least, before asking the people for their votes. I have served on
the board of examiners and also as school supervisor, and often been at school work eleven months
out of the year.
My family have always been true republicans and I am the first to ask for office.
Since 1 believe I am fitted for the office of superintendent and can serve the people intellegently
and well as anyone else in the County, I respectfully solicit the support of every man. woman, boy
and girl.

Conditions Along
The Border.'
Dear Editor and Friends of
Knox County:
I take great pleasure in writ
ing you of the conditions of the
Mexican border.
We have been here about six
weeks, in camp with about
40,000 National guards and
regular soldiers, representing
every part of the United States.
We were in a parade on Sept. 18,
every branch of the U. S. Army
being represented. It was the
largest since the Civil War.
Kentucky and Ohio soldiers did
their part and received a compli
ment from General Bell.
Cacti, rattle-snakes, scorpions,
centipedes and horned toads are
about the only thing that is
raised in this part of Texas.
People say it don't rain here, but
it has been raining here for
a week. It gets very cold at
night and during the day it is
veiy hot. Sand storms are very
frequent. You can't tell when
one is coming up. If you are so
unlucky as to be caught out in
one you are out of luck. You

Mr. William Tye,

My dear Tye:
. I want to congratulate you on
I the excellent work of your Pig

of the fact that you were able to
win the State Championship at
the State Fair.
I also want to congratulate
Mr. Robsion, President and Mr.

Directors of the First National

advanced idea in regard to the
agriculture of Knox county. I
know that they have been much
help to you as well as to the ex
tension work and it is through
the aid of such institutions as
this bank that a brighter day is
dawning for Kentucky. As you
probably know, this bank was
the first bank in Kentucky to
accept the idea of giving away
pigs to help the boys in their
county and the example that
they have laid down has been
followed practically all over the
State.
I am coming to Knox before
long and I hope that through
some generous assistance, such
as we have gotten from the above
bank, to be able to put on a
strong campaign for better
cattle.
Very truly ours,
I. H. Collins,
District Agent.
