The election held last Tuesday
throughout the United States
will go into history as the closest
and most spectacular ever held.
At the time the News went to
press Friday it was practically
certain that Woodrow Wilson
was re-elected president of the i
United States. For the last two
days the result has hinged on
the vote in California, but the
state was conceded Friday morn
ing to Wilson. Of course the
election may be contested by the
losers in several of the close
states, but so far as the unofficial
returns are concerned President
Wilson is re-elected.
The election was spectacular
because it was so different from
previous elections. The demo
crats won in many western and
middle western states which had
nearly always been carried by
the republicans; the republicans
won in eastern states that were
conceded to be democratic. Utab,
Idaho and California have gone
for Wilson. New York, New
Jersey and Indiana gave large
majorities to Hughes.
In Arizona, there is but little
doubt that Tom Campbell, repub
lican, has been elected governor.
Democrats seem to have won
all the other state officers, to
gether with senator and repre
sentative. The prohibition amend
ment seems to have received a
safe majority, but on the other
amendments the result is un
certain. In Navajo county the demo
crats won everything excepting
the sheriff, one supervisor and
state representative. R. L. New
man, republican incumbent of
the sheriff's office, was re-elected
over Jos. Woods, democrat. C.
E. Owens, republican, was elected
supervisor, and J. E, Richards,
republican, was elected state
representative. The county gave
a majority of about 80 votes to
Tom Campbell for governor. Un
official returns of the vote by
precints on county candidates
outside Indian Wells, will be
found elsewhere on this page.
A. M. Boyer, democrat, de
feated W- B. Woods, republican,
for justice of the peace in Hol
brook precinct by 31 votes. Dr.
G. P. Sampson, democrat, was
Wilson is
elected justice of the peace in
Winslow against a republican and
independent candidate.
Apache eounty elected two re
publican supervisors, W. A.
Saunders for the long term, and
Heber Jarvis for the short term.
The republicans probably elected
Ed Greer county attorney and
Mrs. Tenney superintendent of
schools. The democrats claim
everything else.
The election of Freeman and
Owens as supervisors gives the
upper country two members of
the board, while Holbrook has
no representative. The voters
eyidently decided to grab two
members when they had a chance,
regardless of politics, fair-play
or any other consideration.
There was a rumor in Holbrook
last night that there had been
some irregularities in the voting
in one of the upper country pre
cincts, and it is possible, that the
election may be contested.
Stock Poison Baffles Experts
Albuquerque, N. M., Nov. 8:
The discovery of a poisonous
spring, which appears to be poi
sonous only part of the time, and
whose poisonous principle is of
such an obscure nature as to
baffle even the experts of the
National Bureau of Chemistry,
is announced by Forest Officers
here. The spring is located on
the Canjilon District of the Na
tional Forest.
Every once in a while a bunch
of live stock dies after watering
at this spring. The rest of the
time the water seems harmless.
With a view to running down the
cause of the trouble and devis
ing a remedy, the local Forest
Ranger sent samples of the
water to the Government chem
ists. Analysis shows a striking-
I ly large amount of nitrate and a
long list of other salts; also
; many poisons, but in such min
ute quantities as to seem negli
gible. Do these substances per
iodically form some deadly com
bination? This is the question
which puzzles the experts. The
néxt move, according to the Dis
trict Forester here, is a study of
symptoms of the poisoned ani
mals. By this meams it is hoped
to throw some light on the pre
sent enigma.

Literary Society Organized
Recently the thirty students in
Mr. Ryan's room were organized
into two societies or clans the
Dynamos with gold and white
for colors and the Golden Rule
society with pink and white for
colors. These societies clash in
monthly contests in essay, reci
tation, debate, oration, reading
etc.
The officers of the Golden Rule
presided Friday, Mary Zuck and
Warden Black. In December
President Minnie Wallace and
Secretary Arnold Lee are to pre
side. The Literature societies of
room 3 rendered a very interest
ing program Friday which was
enjoyed bv a large audience com
posed of patrons and upper-classmen.
Minnie Wallace, in oration,
Winnie Greer in recitation and
Arsenia Ortega in essay took the
honor for the Dynamo society
while the reading was won by
Claude Despain of the Golden
Rule. This society also won the
spirited debate, defending the
negative side of the proposition,
"Resolved, that country life is
better than city life."
The judges were Mrs. Wisdom,
Miss Clack and Mr. Kemp. Every
contestant was roundly applaud
ed and rivalry and enthusiasm
characterized the entire rendi
tion. Roll call was responded to
by literary gems. Edna Black
rendered an instrumental solo
and Regina Wetzler presided at

the organ.
The oration, "Woodrow Wil
son" by Minnie Wallace created
so much favorable comment that
she found it necessary to deliver
it at the Pastime theater and
also at the Winslow democratic
rally Monday night
Mr. Ryan is to be commended
upon arousing so much interest
in literary work in connection
with the work in grammar and
english. Another contest occurs
thirty days hence.
University of Arizona Press Letter
It has been truthfully said that
half of a college education is
gained outside of the classroom;
it is gained by association with
other students, by the personal
toach of the faculty and in gen
eral, by the environments under
which the student labors and
learns. This may be followed by
a statement that much of that
learned outside of the classroom
is learned by dormitory life.
In this regard the students at
the University of Arizona are
rather at a disadvantage this
year, for the University has
grown so rapidly in the last two
years, that the dormitories are
now overcrowded, and many
have been forced to room off the
campus. In order toa commodate
as many as possible the Univer
sity has been forced to put three
in a room, but even this was not
enough.
Those forced to room off the
j campus are at a disadvantage,
I not only because they have to
pay four times as much for their
rooms at least, but because they
lack the close touch with campus
activities, and are really losing a
great deal of 'their college educa
tion. It is fortunate that the legis
lature meets this year, as it will
undoubtedly provide more space,
thus correcting the situation.
Close association with campus
activities make for college spirit,
college loyalty and breadth of
thought.

Notice to Parents and Teachers
Owing to the number of acci
dents to pupils caused by the use
of the swing and slide apparatus
on the school grounds, it has
been decided to discontinue the
use of the swings and slides for
the present.
If it is found later, that the
apparatus can be arranged dif
ferently so that there will be
less likelihood of accidents re
sulting from its use, this mav be
done. For the present, the par
ents and teachers are asked to
aid us in preventing further acci
dents by instructing the children
to refrain from using the play
device in its present condition.
