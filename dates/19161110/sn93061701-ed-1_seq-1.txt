WILSON HAS 232 VOTES
MEW YORK AND ILLINOIS GIVE
BIG MAJORITY FOR RE
PUBLICAN CANDIDATE.
Hew York, Nov. 8. Burly this
(naming tho returns, while still incom
plete, made Wilson reasonably certain
if 2112 votea In the electoral college
aad seemed to give Hughes 218. There
Were SI vdtea still in doubt, 2U(i baing
ft.iuired for aa flection.
These stat. a were counted for Wil
ton: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
Colorado, Florida, Geoigia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Mis
souri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada,
N'nh Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee.
Tvxas, Utah and Virginia. . Total, 23J.
Vor Hughes were claimed: Connec
Mnut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine
Massachusetts Michigan, New Jersey,
Now York, Pennsylvania Rhode Island,
South Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin
and Wyoming. Total, 218.
At 6: IS a. in. returns from Chey
enne took Wyoming from the Hughes
tint and placed its three electoral
votes in tho doubtful column, with
Wilson leading.
These states were doubtful: Call
f oral a, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon,
Washington and West Virginia. To
tal. 81.
Hughes carried New York by a plu
raiity estimated at 120,000. Wilson
tarried New York City by about 40,
000, but that was more than offset by
tot Hughes votes upstate. The re
turns outside of New York City are In
complete, but they indicate an upstate
plurality of 160,000 (or Hughes.
Illinois has gone to Hughes by a plu
rality that may approximate Roose
velt's' record of 304,000 In 1904.
Southern Illinois, the Republican cit
adel, was solid for the Hughes elect
ors. President Wilson made no gains
In any of the downstate except for a
small Increase around Centralis, where
William Jennings Bryan made a per
son a 1 appeal to boyhood friends.
Ohio, according to the early returns,
had been carried by Wilson by a tre
saendous plurality. Later the figures
favorable to tho President we're con
siderably reduced and the Republican
managers assorted the slate would be
found eventually to have gone for
Hughes by 20,0(10.
Unless, however, the vote in the ru
ral districts which has not been re
ported should prove overwhelming for
Hughes, Ohio roust be conceded to the
President,
Hughes developed a strong lead In
West Virginia which, if sustained by
succeeding returns, will give him the
state by a small margin.
Kansas was In doubt, according to
the early returns, Wilson making a
big showing in the cities. When the
country districts were heard from,
however, Hughes assumed the lead,
and the Indications are that he has
tarried the state.
The President ran well in San Fran
cisco, but Hughes carried Los Angeles
County by 25,000, and probably has
won Che thirteen electoral votes of
California.
There seems to be little doubt that
Utah, Nevada and Montana have been
Carried by Wilson. New Mexico, which
the Republicans had counted upon,
appears to have gone Democratic.
The Republican hopes of carrying
Kentucky received a decided setback
and i.ll the indications now point to
a Wilson victory in the state.
In Maryland the outcome Is in
doubt. Hughes in the later returns
Wisconsin Guard Votes.
San Antonio, Tex. Approximately
1.600 Wisconsin guardsmen on duty at
Camp Wilson voted in the presidential
lection. The returns were taken to
Madison, Wis., to be canvassed In the
tate department.
Election Official Drops Dead.
Colorado Springs. Matthew May
hew. 59 years old, an election judge in
Weed 1. Precinct 4, dropped dead as
the result of excitement over the out
come of the presidential voting.

nad estaonsnea a ieaa mat, it main
tained, would give him the state by a
safe margin,
Missouri also Is In doubt. Hughes
'ias a lead in St. Louis, while Wilson
was ahead by about the same amount
in the country districts.
Minnesota was claimed by both the
Republican and Democratic managers.
The incomplete returns showed a tre
mendous slump In the normal Reput
llcan vote In the state. The result
apparently Is close.

states favorable to the President,

the lower branch of Congress the Re
publicans have made serious inroads
on the Democratic control. The Senate
memberships of the two parties may
be only one or two in favor of the
Democrats.

lican candidate, John L. Kennedy, was

test In Delaware is still in doubt. The
Democratic candidate, J. O. Wolcott,
bad a slight advantage over Senator
du Pont. Republican. In Maryland
Iewls, Democrat, and France, Repub
lican, were running a neck-and-neck
race.
The majority of the House will be
small. Republican gains were made
in New York, Maryland, West Vir
ginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Tennes
see, Oklahoma, Kansas and California.
In the first Oklahoma district, the
Republican candidate for Congress, T.
A. Chandler, defeated the Democrat,
Congressman Davenport
In the third Tennessee district.
Congressman Moon, Democrat, chair
man of the house postofftce commit
tee and author of the new railway
mall pay law, was beaten by Jesse M

cialists were claiming the election; of

Davidson, Republican, defeated Con
gressman Reilly.

Congress.
