Money Chief Munition Needqd
in War Against Dread
WhitePlague
"If ever there were a place where
funds were needed to fight tubercu
losis, Honolulu is the place," said J.
R. Galt of the Hawaiian Trust Com
pany this morning, "and I hope the
Boy Scouts campaign tomorrow for
funds with which to fight--the plague
will be the most successful' ever held
here, especially since it has been so
clearly demonstrated how the disease
may be successfully eradicated with a
properly-conducted fight which costs
money. -. Honolulans have been very
generous in this matter in the past
but still more money is needed."
Gait is one of the most energetic
and conscientious workers for Palama
Settlement and against tuberculosis
in every part of Honolulu. He knows
what Leahl Home has done to over
come the ravages of the disease but
declares there should be more Leah is;
he realizes as well as anyone else how
much the Pa Ola Day Camp is doing
for afflicted Honolulu children and
Incidentally for the" homes by the chil
dren carrying home the Instructions
of how to wipe out the "germ that
kills; and he says that with enough
money and workers the time is com
ing when the death toll from conta
gious diseases here will not be more
than 75 per cent tuberculosis.
Seals and money boxes have been
distributed to the Boy Scouts: every
campaigner for anti-tuberculosis sales
and donations knows his place and
work and understands that no person
or residence or business house in Ho
nolulu is to be lett unvisited tomorrow.
Scoutmasters have assigned positions
and are awaiting the opening gun with
automobiles which will carry the funds
back to headquarters at the Star-Bulletin
office. Christmas seals may be
had from the Boy Scouts tomorrow at
one cent apiece; donations may be
given to them or to the scoutmasters
or placed directly in the head office.
The chief thing those interested in the
campaign want is the money and they
feel assured that they are going to
get it in larger quantity than ever be
fore. It must be remembered that 90
per cent of all proceeds from the sale
of seals remains In Honolulu and no
money donated leaves the islands,

Every thing is ready for a big time
