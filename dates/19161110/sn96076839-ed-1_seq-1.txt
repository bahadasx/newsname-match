Election Is
In Doubt
Presidcntal Race Narrowing To
Close Margins
Entire Republican State and
County Ticket Is Elected
State Goes "Dry" and Buries
"Home Rule."
As the returns keep coming in slowly
the presidential race between Wilson
and Hughes seems narrowing to closer
points and the final electoral vote is
going to be small whichever way it
goes. In fact it may be necessary for
a recount in some of the close states
before either side will be satisfied. At
the headquarters of both the big politi
cal parties rather wild claims are made,
and it might be well to remember that
anything going over the wires these
days is from campaign headquarters
and will naturally be more or less
biased.
. STATE TICKET WINS
entire le
V and Count
flcomfortabh
'epublican State, Legis-
lty Ticket was elected
le majorities. Sleeper
lor Governor will receive over 50,000
majority with returns only partially in.
In spite of strenuous efforts to defeat
him, Congressamn Frank Scott was re
elected by a good majority. In the
county everything went Republican.
STATE GOES DRY
While it was freely predicted that
Michigan would go "Dry" and "Home
Rule" would be defeated, no one was
prepared for the landslide in favor of
state-wide prohibition. In supposed-to-be
wet centers like Wayne and Kent
counties, the voters left no doubts in
the minds of anyone their desire for
the banishment of the saloon, and
practically every county in the state
declared itself emphatically in favor of
state-wide prohibition and hit "Home
Rule" a solar plexus blow.
County Returns Incomplete
For some reason no efforts were
made to get full reports of the election
from the twenty-five precincts in
Charlevoix County so that any kind
"of a report would be far from satis
factory. In a number of precincts, the
three in Fast Jordan included, the elec
tion boards completed their work and
the reports were sealed before a tally
of the votes were made for publication.
No definite figures will be available
until the County Canvassing Board
meets next week and makes the final
returns on the votes cast.

OUR NEXT GOVERNOR.
Do you want to make a clear saving
of 125.00 to $50.00 on your expenses be
tween now and the first day of next
January? You can do it and this is the
way you can do it. You will be mak
ing many purchases for yourself and
your family for fall and winter pur
poses and for the Christmas time.
There is always some merchant in town
who will do a little better by you 'than
nybody else. When a merchant is
able to do this he is keen to advertise
and let the people know just what he
can and will do. Your own cue is to
read carefully each week the adver
tiscments in this paper. They tell the
story and the name of the merchant
who makes the story. Read the ads.
The man who does hot take his home
papv misses three-fourths of what is
going on in his home community. He
must either borrow the paper from his
neighbor and be considered a tight wad
and a nuisance, or he must be content
to learn a little and know less.

MARKET CONDITIONS.
East Lansing, Mich. Oct. 30th The
Markets Office desires to study some
reported inadequacies of market con
ditions and services in the Northern
Counties especially north of the P. M.
Railway from Saginaw to Ludington
and provide such advices and remedies
as is possible. Attention will be given
and advices relating to the work
necessary to secure loans under the
new Federal Mortgage Loan law, for
capital is an essential aid in marketing.
It is requested that Agricultural Organ
izations and individuals write this office
so that a comprehensive covering of
the territory may be made later, and
especially during the period of the
Farmer's Institute season.
JAMES N. McBRIDE,
Michigan Director of Markets.
Every merchant in this town wants
to sell you goods. You want to trade
with the merchant who will do the best
by you, who will sell you the best
goods at the least price. It is up to
you to read the ads in this paper, and
it is up to the merchant to see that you
read his ad. When you both do this
L-lL
yuu uuui win.

oTOoCHIOIEeiEI
A PkOCLAMATHOM BY TOE MATOIFL
TO THE PEOPLE OF EAST JORDAN:
The great problem or civic government is always in the last
analysis a question of public morals' and ideals. And every
agency of the community which tends to develop a greater moral
consciousness, and to teach a higher moral standard, is a positive
help to the community as a whole, and should be encouraged in
every way. And among these many forces, none has exerted a
more wholesome influence than the Church.
In our national history its influence has been untold. In aid
ing the public schools, in inspiring and sustaining all charitable
institutions, in teaching old and young it has continually been a
benefactor.
Every good citizen will therefore, I am confident, agree with
the purpose of this letter. All thru the cpuntry attention is being
called to the Church, and men and women are everywhere being
urged to show their support and sympathy with the Church.
Therefore, as Mayor of this City, I do designate November
12-26 as a GO-TO-CHURCH Month for the City or East Jordan, and
I do urge all citizens to participate in this Movement, by making
a special effort during these weeks to aid the Churches perform a
better service for the community as a whole. On each Sunday,
let each one attend the Church of his choice.
A. E. CROSS, Mayor.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
What are you doing for this town?
What are you doing to justify your
citizenship in this town?
You can not sit down, criticise, let
others do the work that makes a town
or community, and still call yourself a
good citizen.
The good citizen never thinks only of
self. He must necessarily think of
self or he would not survive, but good
citizenship requires more than that
much more.
It requires that you j keep in mind
that there are others who have rights
and are entitled to have those rights re
spected by others by you. On the
same basis you are entitled to have
your rights equally respected by them.
That is good citizenship partially.
In addition, the good citizens remem
bers that his town is entitled to his best
efforts in its behalf, to the end that the
interests of the community may be ad
vanced by all legitimate means.
This means, too, that in advancing
the interests you are advancing your
own, which is the ultimate aim of the
human race.
What, then, are you doing to consti
tute yourself a good citizen?
The Best of the Bargain.
You get a bargain when you get The
Youth's Companion for 1917 for $2.00

you get the best of the bargain if you
subscribe the minute you read this, for
then you will get free every number of
The Companion issued between the
time you subscribe and New Year's. If
you send your $2.00 at once that means
a lot of reading for which you won't
have to pay a cent. And then the long

Beans, Corn and
Potatoes Short
Production Figures for the Year
Of 1916.
Lansing, Nov. 6. Fully twenty-five
per cent of the bean, corn and potato
crops were not harvested this year on
account of total or partial failure of the
crop, says the crop report of the state
department today. Coupled with this
bit of discouraging information the state
report adds that a considerable per
centage of the corn and potato crop
cannot be marketed, being too soft and
too small.
For the ten years, 1906-1915, the
average yield in bushels of corn per
aere was 32 per cent with an average
crop of 53,585,455 bushels. This year
the yield per acre is only 21.05 and a
crop of 31,373,183 bushels. Potatoes
which in years have averaged 86 bush
els per acre are reduced to 45.22 this
year and the yield from 28,776,634 to
22,266,664 bushels.
Beans are even worse, with an aver
age yield of 6.71 bushels this year per
acre as compared with 12 bushels for
the ten year average, the crop this year
is estimated at only 2,181,862 bushels,
while the ten year average has been
4,965,692. The report gives the esti
mated yield of wheat in the state as 16.
18 bushels per acre with a harvested
crop of 12,404,710 bushels. It is esti
mated that 3,500,000 of this harvest was
marketed during the past three months.
Oats yielded 30.57 bushels per acre
with an estimated harvest yield of 52,
673,474 bushels. Other crop yieldf are:
Barley, 1,968,684 bushels; rye, 6,009,952;
buckwheat, C66.152; peas, 1,002,073;
clover seed, 267,270. Fruit yield are:
Apples, 17,231,059 bushels; peaches,
2,125,648; pears, 1,007,394; plums, 396,
031; cherries, 1.388,349; strawberries,
437,575; raspberries and blackberries,
625,571.
PEOPLE YOU
OUGHT TO KNOW
There are many people in this town
you ought to know, for your own sake.
Some of them you may not know, but
you should.
-You should know the banker. He is
the one who supplies you with money
when you need it, and cares for your
money when you have it. No town
can conduct modern business without
him.
You should know each merchant.
They have the goods you want, and
if you know each one personally you
also know something of the wares they
sell. This enables you to buy judicious
ly and saves you many a lost penny.
.You should know the mechanic.
Every time an improvement is made
you must call him in. If you know
them all you likewise know the one
who is most likely to give you the best
service.
You should know the school teacher.
He is responsible to a great degree for
the moulding of the character of your
children, for the lessons they learn
while under his care are not forgotten
even unto the brink of the grave.
Know him, and help him.
You should know the farmer. He
holds the world in the hollow of his
hand. To him we look for the produc
tion of the sustenance of life, and with
out him we could not live.
You should know the minister. He
is interested in you, though you may
give little thought to him. He does
r.ot supply you with the bread you eat,
or the clothes you wear, but he does
beckon you along the road to a better
life beyond. Know him, and hear him,
and heed him.
And, brother, you should know the
sheriff. When the devil gets under
your hide the sheriff is a good man to
know. If you are inclined to kick up
a little dust your knowledge of him
may cause you to pause before you
kick. Yes, brother, know the sheriff,
for while you are a good citizen he is
your friend, and when you cease to be
good he puts you where you can be
nothing but good.
CURFEW ORDINANCE

provisions on the streets of East Jor

Farmers Get
Big Profits
Phenomenal Prices for all Farm
Crops.
Washington, Nov. 7. In this high-
cost-of-living era, about the only per
son who can sit back and chuckle loud
is the man on the farm. The extent to
which the producer may find genuine
satisfaction is the steadily advancing
price of table necessaries is clearly
shown by the latest official complica
tions of the government.
The profits reaped by producers of
the United States in the last twelve
months have been more prenomenal
than were ever recorded in a similar
period. Thousands of correspondents
of the bureau of crop estimates sub
mitted reports, and on these are based
the high averages announced.
The index figure of prices Oct. 1, for
principal crops was about 27.6 per cent
higher than a year ago. The level of
prices for the principal crops in Sep
tember alone increased about 1.3 ' per
cent.
Meat animals hogs, cattle, sheep
and chickens brought the producers
on Sept. 15 prices that were 23.7 per
cent more than they received a year
ago. The index figure of prices for
such products was declared to be higher
by 22.5 per cent than the average for
the past six years. In the . thirty days
between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15 the prices
soared 4.1 per cent.-
The price of hogs Sept. 15 was un
usually high, averaging for the United
States $9.22 per hundred pounds, as
compared with $8.61 a month before,
and $6.79 a year ago.
Beef cattle averaged $6.55 per hun
dred pounds, compared with $6.51 a
month ago, and $6.06 a year ago. Sheep
averaged $6.25 per hundred pounds,
compared with $6.22 the previous
month, and $4.49 a year ago.
Official estimates of the farm value of
important products besides those men
tioned, Sept. 15, last, with comparative
figures that obtained on the same day
the preceding year, are as follows:
Veal calves $S.77 per hundred pounds.
formerly $7.80; lambs, $8.22 per hun
dred pounds, formerly $6.71; milk cows
$61.41 per head, formerly $58.38;
chickens 14 cents per pound, formerly
12 cents; eggs 25 cents per dozen,
formerly 20 cents; apples $2.30 per
barrel, formerly $1.80; peaches $1.18
per bushel, formerly $0.81; beans $4.60
per bushel, formerly $2.70; tomatoea
76 cents per bushel, formerly 57 cents;
onions $1.23 per bushel, formerly 83
cents; cabbage $2.17 per hundred
pounds, formerly $1.24; wheat $1.36 per
bushel, formerly 90 cents; corn 82 cents
per bushel, formerly 70 cents; oats 44
cents per bushel, formerly 34 cents;
potatoes $1.12 per bushel, formerly 48
cents; cotton 15 cents per pound, for
merly 11 cents.
