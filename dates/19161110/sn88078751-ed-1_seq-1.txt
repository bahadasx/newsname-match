San Francisco, Nov. 9 Further re
turns, principally from the south, '
bring Wilson's lead in California to
:s,G'J2. In 5,504 precincts out of
5,017, Wilson has 450,719 and Hughes
447,027. Sixteen precincts still out
in Los Angeles county. 1
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 9 Hughes i
loading Wilson in Minnesota. On" j

o
Washington, D. C, Nov. 9 The de
pal tment of justice has ordered Divis
ion Chiof Calbough of Chicago to go
to Minnesota immediately with his
entire force of secret service agents
to watch the counting of ballots. Thus
action followed reports that a wide
spread attempt to "steal" the state
had been uncovered.
Now Hampshire has gone for Wil
son by 93 votes. This was claimed
by tho Republicans until today.
Now York, Nov. 9. Tho result of
tho race for tho presidency Is still In
grave doubt, with tho possibility that
a very few votes In tho electoral col
lege, perhaps ono or two, will decldo
ft.
President Wilson seems sure of 251 i
totes and Mr. Hughes of 224, with 266
necessary to a cholco. California and
Minnesota, are the states with which
tho final decision is likely to rest. '
Both states are In doubt, with the '
president leading In California by
4,410, with 570 of 5,917 precincts still '
out, and Hughes is. leading In Min
nesota by 739, with 534 of 3024 pre- I
clncts still to hear from. California
has 13 electoral votes and Minnesota
12. The vote of oithor would elect
Wilson, if he holds what ho seems
to have.
West Virginia, with eight votes, also
Is very closo, with a margin of only
about 2,000 votes between tho candi
dates. Tho vote In North Dakota, with five
electoral votes, with about 400 pre- I
clncts to report, is practically a tio, I
with first ono candidate, now the oth
er, In the lead.
It Is said In Minnesota that the re-'
suit there may bo decided by the vote
of the National Guaxdsmon now on
tho border. This vote amounts to
2,800 and It will not be known for
seven' d"rs How It has gone.
Idaho, Kansas, Washington and Wy
oming, although incomplete, still aro
leaning to President Wilson's column.
New Hampshire was accredited by
tho secretary of stato to Hughes by
tho narrow margin of 1G1 votes, but
was claimed by tho Democrats.
North Dakota Is now claimed for
Hughes by William It. Wlllcox, chair
man of the Republican national com
mittee, who, after dining with Charles
J3. Hughes, said "I believe that Mr.
Hughes has been elected and he
shores my view. Wo ask only what In
fair; we want only what we aro en
titled to and what we propose
have."

Democrats Make A Gain Of Three
Congressmen In Ohio
Columbus, Nov. 9. Returns from
4,902 precincts In Ohio give President
Wilson 507;453, as compared with
434,412 for Hughes. This ratio, if
carried out in tho remaining pre
cincts, assures him more than S0,0UQ
plurality.
Returns from 4,839 precincts gave
Pomerene 472,890 votes, as against
Herrick's 4C0.G50. Returns from 4,936
precincts gavo former Governor Cos
484,5.-5 votes and Willis 474.918.
Senator Pomerene is re-eleotcd by
probably 20,000 to 25,000, and former
Governor Cox by 15,000 to 20,000.
Supreme Court Judges Johnson and
Donahue were re-elected with lartje I
pluralities. I
The Democrats have a safe voting I
majority In the stato senate and on i
the face of returns are sure of a work- '
ing majority in tho house of repre
sentatives, j
For state candidates 1,634 precincts
show the following:
Lieutenant Governor- Arnold, 183,
090; nioom, 198,740.
Secretary of State Hildebrant,
194,927; Fulton, 198,992.

Tabulations In the offlco of Secre-
In 1634 precincts out of 5750, Joseph
McGhee, Democrat, had a lead of less
than 1,000 over Turner. This number
of precincts gave Turner 192,226 and
McGhee 193.103.
Friends of Turner made compila
tions showing that Turner ran 9,000
hhead of Governof Willis. Demo
crats, however, were claiming the el
ection of McGhee by a small margin.
The clpan sweep of the Democrats
will mean the dispensing of much new
patronage in tho slato departments.
The only department at present under
Democratic control is that of State
Auditor Dorahcy. Several Important
Willis appointments to state boaids
and commissions were for unexpired
terms which will expire within the
first year of Cox's new administration.
ACKNOWLEDGES DEFEAT
Governor Willis Congratulates
Cox
and Makes Statement.
Columbus, Nov. 9. Acknowledging
his defeat, Governor Willis sent Governor-elect
Cox this telegram: "I
congratulate you on your election aJ
governor of Ohio."
Governor Willis then Issued the fol
lowing statement: Statements by de
feated candidates are odious. I have
heard numerous explanations of the
Democratic landslide In Ohio, but the
only explanation that actually ex
plains Is a lamentable shortage of Re
publican votes.
The Democratic brethren have de
feated us this time, but wo have only
I Just begun to fight and will win tha
j next time I take this opportunity to
thank the loyal host of voters who
supported us In tho contest Just
closed,
Let us form anew the linos of battle
