New York, Nov. ID. Worn out
by the tension of waiting fr the re
turns, from doubtful states which
would determine whether he had
been elected to the presidency, Clias
E, Hugnes retired at 9 o'clock to
night. He spent the day at 1iis
hotel, except for a two hour auto
mobile rids with his wife this after
noon. Mr. Hughes has not yet con
ceded the election of President- Wil
son and probably will not do so until
the vote of cl6se states has been of.
licially counted,
George W. 1'crkins conferred this
afternoon with the Republican candi
date. . lie stated that no definite de
cision had been reached by managers
in regard to demanding a recount in
California, New Mexico and North
Dakota. lie Intimated action prob
ably would be deferred until the of
ficial count in those states was com.
pleted, in the hope that there might
be an overturn of the comparatively
slender Wilson pluralities.
. Republican national headquarters
hire were deserted early tonight.

Outcome of New Mexican
Voting Determines Last
District Independents
rfold Balance
New York.- Nov. U. With re
turns missing tonight from only one
congressional district in the United
States, the republicans and democrats
each had elected 215, representees.
The votes in New Mexico which
is still in doubt, probably will deter
mine which "party is to have a plura
lity of one over the other. The present
mumber from New Mexico is a re
publican. The balance of powers in the next
house will be held by four men, one
a progressive-protecionist from Louis
iana one an indeoendent from Massa
chusetts, one a progressive from
Minnesota, and other a socialist from
New York Their action apparently
will determine the choice of a speaker
as well as the fate of legislation
which js. supported" or opposed on
purely party lines.
