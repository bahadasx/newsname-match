Sord Thursday morning on the re

voting precincts in the state. On the
face of these returns Gardner led Hen
rr Lamm, Republican, by 4,617 votes.
A majority of the ouUtandlng pre

indication is that Gardner will win
wlUa a plurality of about T.000.
Ths returns Indicate that President

plurality in excess of 80,000, and that
Senator Reed has earried it over Wal
ter fl. Dickey with a plurality in ex

the other candidates on the ticket,

appear to have been defeated, though j
there Is a possibility that the amend
