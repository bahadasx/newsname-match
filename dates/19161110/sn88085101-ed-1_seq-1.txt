KING PIP’S PROCLAMATION.
To the fairest of my subjects, the
princesses of Apple Land, where grow
the rosy traits In whose name we once
again celebrate: greetings and glad
news.
Know ye, that in our city of Spo
kane we hold our court of merrymak
ing and thanksgiving to the fullness
of a week In the present month, the
same being from the 20th to the 25th
day. Ourself and our subjects, the
good citizens of Spokane, alike prepare
for you a royal welcome, that lour
youth nnd beauty may grace the festi
vals and the games by which our regal
splendor is published to the world.
Our wish and our command Is laid
upon all of you, the Princesses Apple
Blossom, that with your retinue and
retainers, in holiday garb clad, >e be
presented once again at our National
Apple Show, the ninth In Its succes
sion ; and with it goes our royai assu
tance that there shall lack nothing
of delight to make your stay a memory
happy Into eternity.
The managers of the National Apple
Show, that takes place at Spokane
thought that they had hit upon a happy
solution oC lining up the ranks of the
princesses to take part in the festlvl
ties headed by King Hip, by starting a
voting contest in the papers of the
Okanogan district. That-contest-has de
generated Into very much of a farce. It
has been reported at this office that
in a neighboring town votes can be
purchased by the bundle. It is evi
dent that the people up this way have
looked upon the contest with suspic
ion as only a few ballots have been
filed at this office. Undoubtedly when
the contest was proposed it was the
intention and expectation that voting
would be confined to legitimate ballots
cut from newspapers. Possibly one
reason that more interest has not been
taken in the contest was the fact that
a national election was pending and
people were so interested in that issue
that selecting a princess was consider
ed of minor importance. As this paper
promised to aid in the proposition in
sofar as publishing the ballot and so
liciting votes, the ballot appears in
this issue of this week for the
time. No ballot will be received after
the 13th of the month. So far Miss
Lorraine Bartell has received 10 votes
and Miss Goldie Mitchell some 200, ac
cording to the ballots Hied at this of
fice.
The circular .stt?r cnt v i<U bguro
in the late campaign, especially asi re
lating to our minor offices.. The tight
for Commissioner in the First District
was something fierce. Farty lines were
entirely obliterated, and more talk was
indulged In over that single office than
all the others combined frol “ P re " ®
down to coroner. To the credit of those
engaged in boosting candidates It can
be said that no mud slinging was In
dulged in. Mr. Miller was somewhat
off in his circular suggestion that a
few small politicians in Oroville were
M. reelectloti. ..
the Oroville precinct goes to shov.

or elected, which was not known at the

owing Oroville a debt of gratitude,
will cut some ice in the future when
is understood that the outside can»o 1

town arc at stake.

Happenings When the Land Was
Voting nnd Sparsely Settled.
(Btom the Loomis Prospector or
November 6 and 12, 1897.)
* ■ Harris is over in the neighbor
hood ot Orovilie doing assessment
work for Messrs Boyd, Forde and
Samson on the Professor, a claim sit
uated on Kruger mountain, and Just
this side of the International boundary
line. (And, by the way, what has ever
become of the "Professor?" It does not
figure in any of the claims worked
nowadays.)
In that day the Prospector was ham
mering Nor good roads and getting
about as much results as are secured
today when there are a dozen papers
In the county appealing for better
highways, with numerous organiza
tions lending vocal aid at least to the
same end. Mention is made of Jesse
Hunley Improving the road from Loo
mis to Mghlhawk, Mr. Hunley long
ago passed on to his fathers and the
road that he was putting in better re
pair is hardly much improved at the
present time over the conditions pre
vailing twenty years ago. Considering
the condition of the county roads to
day and the enormous sums spent on
them during the past twenty years It
seems almost criminal the way money
tits been w'asted.
Andrew Carlson, who has held down
the Job of blacksmlthlng at the Tri
une mine for a long time, was over
to Loomis Saturday. (Mr. Carlson has
been ranching for a number of years
on the mountain not far from the Tri
une mine.)
Tuesday AI M. Rlste and Miss Mar
garet Watson were united In marriage
Judge O. S. Stocker performing the
ceremony. (Mr. Rlste Is still living
in the Sirallkameen valley, the lady
he married is dead and Judge Stocker
Is a resident of Wenatchee.)
Mr. Ellis, who la Just back from a
trip to Falrview, Informs us that that
camp has made rapid strides during
the past summer and is an active,
promising and bustling place. The new
mill at the Tin Horn mine was to start
up this week. If it proves to be a suc
cess three other mills are to be con
structed Immediately. The big hotel
.under way will hardly be completed
before next spring. He believes that
Fairvlew has every promise of making
a flourishing city. (But the promise
never materialized. Work on the mines
ceased years ago after thousands of
dollars were spent in exploration, and
today Fairvlew Is a mere hamlet, yet
a popular resort for those with a
yearning thirst, and no life saving
station on this side of the line.)
On the 12th the Prospector was very
garrulous and enthusiastic over “an
other strike” In the Palmer mountain
tunnel. (Alas and alack, those reports
were numerous over a period cover
ing several years, yet, in the end, came
to nothing.)
Alice J. Tinsley filed a homestead
Wednesday pn 160 acres of land near
Loomis.
The first snow of the season fell in
tile valley Monday, but was confined
to a very thin covering.
L. S. Baldwin is engaged making a
complete survey and plat Of the Bull
Frog group of claims on Palmer
mountain for Dell Hart. (Mr. Baldwin
died at Boise City, Idaho, years ago,
and the Bull Frog group Is about the
In same condition ns at the time of the
survey.)
Charlie Ballard was working his
"rich Mammoth mine” on Slate creek,
in the Methow valley, and was at Loo
mis on a visit. (In those days Mr. Bal
lard was a mineral surveyor and an
engineer by profession, and engaged
In mining as a aide line. We do not
know where he Is hanging out at the
present time, but the "rich Mammoth"
has refused to give up its wealth un
to the present day.)
Work is in progress on the Quin
tette Mining Co's., claims and the Alli
son group, located a short distance up
the Slmllkameen rlvor from Oroville,
under charge of the erratic Dr. Lang
hammer. (A portion of this property,
we believe. Included the Qwasco claims
and much was expected from the prop
erty at the time. Dr. Langhammer, who
was certainly a queer character, went
from here to Rosslandf, where he sub
sequently committed suicide.)
Chas. Gerhard, who came all the way
from Montana to do annual assessment
work on his two Palmer mountain
claims, the Columbia and Second
Prize, has spent a month or six weeks
pounding the drill. He has made good
progress sinking through the forma
tion and is well pleased with the re
sults of his labors. He reports that
both of his claims are showing up a
high grade quartz, far better than any
tiling that he could have hoped for,
(Mr.Gerhard died at Tonasket Tues
day.) •
Apples were apples In those days as
they commanded from 4 to 5 cents per
pound in the market.
S. J. Slncock took a contract to
.T,nk a 25 foot shaft on one of the
claims of the Rainbow group. (Mr
Slncock is now a prosperous citizen
of Tonasket. having given up mining
at Tonasket has
been discontinued. Those who for
merly received mall through that of
fice will now get It at Alma. (That To
nasket is not the Tonasket of the pres
ent day. The old Tonasket was more
generally known as Parry s Ferrj. W.
OROVILLE. WASHIN 4TON, TWELFTH YEAR No. 21
W. Parry was the great push ot that
settlement. He owned the ferry across
the Okanogan, the only crossing at that
time between Orovilie and the present
town of Okanogan, then known as
Alma. He also conducted a general
store, was postmaster, had a feed barn,
a lodging house and a saloon. In those
days Mr. Parry did a flourishing busi
ness, as every cent spent In the place
found its way into his possession.
Some Idea can be formed of the Incon
venience of discontinuing the post
office and going away down to Alma,
now Okanogan, for mall. However,
there were very few settlers getting
mall anywhere in those days. Mr. Parry
Is still in the land of the living, but
just where he hangs out we do not
know.)
The Chactaw Boy, upon which con
siderable work was done last month,
shows a Hue body of gold ore at the
bottom of the shaft. This claim Is near
Rainbow Lake, and Is in the midst of
numerous valuable properties. (And
who has ever heat dof the Chactaw Boy
from that day to this?)
Clay Fruit was over from Hughes
camp, on the reservation, Monday,
(The Hughes was Bill Hughes ,a hot
number In those Jays of frontier life,
and Clay Fruit was looking after sheet).
Mr. Fruit afterwards went into the
sheep business oA his own hook, and
prospered exceedingly and Is now en
joying life In comfort on a ranch near
Tonasket.)
P. S. Harris is over at Orovilie do
ing assessment work on some claims
he owns In that vicinity. (Mr. Harris Is
still a resident ofiLooinls.)
Del Hart returned from his trip to
Daveupart and Spokane, Wednesday.
He reports everything lively on the
outside, but that sin and wickedness 1s
rampant at the metropolis. There Is a
great deal of Inquiry regarding this
part of the state. He believes that next
summer will see a mining bootn of
great magnitude about here. Mr. Hart
was highly elated over the great strike
recently made in the Triune, and well
he may be. The first of next month Mr.
Hart leaves for the east on a mission
that has for its object the transfer of
some mining property. Well has Mr.
Hart stuck to and by the country, and
we trust that he will succeed In amass
ing a fortune out of his holdings. (Mr.
Hart did not “amass” a great fortune
from his mining properties, but he has
a hustling faculty that has helped him
keep the wolf-aNUhs way from the
door. He is doing well In the real estate
business in Orovilie even in these dull
times.)
R. R, Hargrove reported encounter
ing some very rich ore on his proper
ties on Mineral Hill, near Cnconully.
(Mr. Hargrove rontlnued hopefully
working those Mineral Hill properties
up to a few years ago, when he passed
av. ay, never realizing his fond expecta
tions of a fortune front mining. Mr.
Hargrove at the time of his death was,
one of the oldest, if not the oldest,
mining operator In the county.
The following Items appears under
the head of Orovllle correspondence;
Lew Wllmot has returned to his post
after a week's absence.
John Wheaton and family of Ellens-)
burg have located in Oro for the win
ter.
Mrs. Dan McCloud has soldrthe Oko
nogan hotel to E. D. King, and is now
stopping with her father, Mr. Simons,
until Mr. McCloud decides upon a per
manent location.
F. M. Baum, manager of the 81-Me
talic Mining Co., made a flying trip
from Spokane to his properties on
Bonaparte mountain last week. He
brought In an expert to inspect the BI-
Metallc group to determine whether
work will continue during the winter
months.
Mr. King took posseslson of the
Okanogan hotel Sunday, but the
real opening was Monday, when ho
gave a dinner to his many friends
that convinced them that Mr. King is a
chef as well as a host. Mr. King will
refurnish the house throughout with
new and tasty furniture, and will soon
bo able to entertain the traveling pub
lic in a first class manner.
Bert, Rlste returned Saturday from
Myers Creek, where he has been rusti
cating for a few days.
Mr. and Mrs. Stocker, Miss Pearl
Rogers and 0. K. Peters, of Loomis,
spent Sunday with Mr. and Mrs. Sam
son and Mr. Forde.
Neil Cochrane, former manager of.
the Wanicut Lake Mining and Milling
company, was looking up old friends in
Oro last week, making his headquar
ters with Mr. and Mrs. Samson,
Mr. Sogle Is probably the happiest
man in town. He has just received the
final receipt to his homestead. Mr.
Sogle has spent years of hard work
and hundreds of dollars improving his
place, and as a result has one of the
finest ranches in Okanogan county.
(That, ranch is now a part of the Oro
vllle townsite and is pretty well cov
ered with buildings. A few of the ap
ple trees in the old Sogle orchard are
still in existence and bear fruit every
ytar.)
LA-VDOW> EUS’ MEETING.

E. RISTE, Secretary,
CIVIC LEAGUE MINSTREL.
The minstrel show that is to be giv
en under the auspices ot the Civic
League this Friday evening, in which
a number ot well known residents of
Orovilie are to take part, promises to
be a scream. The catchy bill convey
some idea of what is coming in the
way of laugh producers, and the mem
ber of the population that fails to be
present is going to miss the big fun
making entertainment of the season.
Those taking part have worked hard
to perfect themselves In the several
parts for which they have been cast,
he public Is promised something In the
amusement line far beyond the ordin
ary. But the program tells the story of
the treat ahead better than anything
that can he written by one not on the
inside and has had a line up on the re

ATTRACTIONS AT THE LYRIC* ,
The attractions hOoked at the Lyric,
heatro for this week itTe VOinarkable
for their high qualify. Manager Stoltz
mndunces that for Saturday and Sun
day nights and the children’s special
ftp Satmflay afternoon matinee the of-,
ferlng will be another of those master-,
pieces with John Barrymore, playing
the leading role, “The Lost Bride
groom.” This popular star since his
appearance on the screen has played
loading parts of strong, manly char
acters, such as Balkan princes, South,
American dictators and assorted Arne*-,
lean character where strong men, men--
tally and physically are required.-
“The Lost Bridegroom" is intensely
humorous, yet thrilling and pathetic
with a dual character of lost identity
around which swirls a plot of fascina
ting activity. Besides “The lost Bride
groom’’ there will be the usual Bray
cartoon and Zoological studies of
strange animal life. The Saturday
afternoon matinee, an innovation for
the benefit of children, farmers and
their families visiting the city on Sat
urdays. and all those who find it' In
convenient to attend at night, has’
proved a great drawing card at this
play house, and the most liberal re'
duct ion of the price for children under
12 years of age is a concession by the
management that gives every "kiddie In
Oroville a chance to see the movies. *
For Wednesday and tfiat
exceedingly popular and beautiful ac
tress Hazed Dawn will occupy the
boards In one of the strongest stories
of the day, “The Saleslady,” This is
the story of 'a beautiful young girl
driven from home by poverty, who
seeks a livillhood In the great city of
New York, and upon her arrival her
beauty attracts the attention of a band
of vllllans who becomes Instrumental
in subjecting her to a series of vicis
situdes that are strange, stirring and
dramatic In the extreme. She becomes
a sales lady, an actress, chorus girl in
a great musical comedy company, etc,
but Iter great beauty, lovable char
acter and musical talent attracts to
her Anally strong friends and assist
ance and brings love, happiness nnd
comfort In the end.
ATTEMPTED BURGLARY.
Last Friday morning about 3 o’clock
T. C. Hume, foreman, of the Gazette
print shop, and who sleeps la the
office, happened to be awake and bis
attention was attracted by two men
walking on the concrete sidewalk in
front of the building He though it
strange that men should be out prom
enading at tbat unseasonable hour, and
his suspicions were aroused. He heard
the door leading to the stairway of the
second story of the Covert block, open,
followed by a noise tbat sounded as
though some one was fumbling with
the lock on the door leading into Mr.
Covert’s store from the hall. Mr.
Hume drew on his slippers, armed
himself with a mallot and going to the
front door of the office saw a man
standing on the sidewalk as though on
guard, while the other man was evi
dently trying to gain admittance to the
store. When Mr. Hume turned the key
in the door the noise alarmed the
would-be burglars and they dashed
himself with a mallet and going to the
darkness Mr. Hume was unabel to see
the men distinctly enough to give any
description that would lead to their
identiAcatlon. It was evident that the
men were bent upon robbery. It would
be Just as well for business men to
see that their premises are kept under
lock and key if the housebreaker is
loose in the land.
