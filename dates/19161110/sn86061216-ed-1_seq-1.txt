CALIFORNIA HOLDS
PIVOTAL POSITION
Latest returns from Cali
jfornia gave Wilson a com-
Li' manding lead there, al
though the republicans de
clined to concede defeat.
The reverse was true in
Minnesota, where Hughes
gained steadily during the
i'day, but the democrats re
fused to concede defeat,
It is apparent that
[Hughes must carry both
,-states and hold all those
now credited to him of par
tial reports, in order to
win,-With California ap
parently lost, the election of
•Wilson seems assured.
New York, Nov. 9.
Chairman McCormick of
the democratic committee
announced late this after
moon that he had sjent tele
grams to all the democratic
state chairmen in the coun
try telling them to "engage
bands and buy red fire to
celebrate tonight the return
of Woodrow Wilson."
New York, Nov. 9. —If the result of
the incomplete returns of Tuesday's
balloting are accepted as final in all
but five states at noon today, the eliec
toral vote woudl give President Wit-
1
con 251 and Mr. Hughes 243.
The five doubtful states with their
electoral votes are: California 13 Min
nesota 12 New Mexico 3 North Da
kota 5 New Hampshire 4.
The sudden switch of New Hamp
shire from a small Hughes plurality to
over a hundred votes for President
Wilson was the dramatic change in the
situation this forenoon. It came in an
nouncement from the secretary of
state that a partial official count of all
the districts disclosed errors In tabu
lation by town and ward clerks to that
••tent. The official count is still pro
gressing.
In Minnesota and New Mexico the
Incomplete returns show Mr. Hyghes
to have a lead, while in California and
North Dakota Mr. Wilson is leading.
The returns from doubtful western
states are belated and not expected to
be available before a late hour today.
Returns Anxiously Awaited.
.The election passed into the second
day of uncertainty with President Wil
son and Charles Evans Hughes both
anxiously awaiting the count in a few
western states—the pivotal ones being
California with thirteen electoral
votes and Mlnesota with twelve, New
Mexico with three and North Dakota
with live.
Although still so close that the re
sult could not be regarded as assured,
Indicative overnight returns seemed to
dispose of previously doubtful states
by placing West Virginia's eight votes
in the Hughes column and giving the
four votes of Idaho and seven from
Washington to President Wilson.
An eleventh hour development came
this morning from Concord, N. H.,
where Secretary of State Bean stated
that with the New Hampshire returns
complete but only partly verified of
ficially, Wilson led by 93 votes. Veri
fication of the New Hampshire re
turns was still in progress.
The Hughes total thus became 243
and the Wilson total 255 with 266 nec
essary to elect.
After so disposing of these prevl
ously doubtful jtates, from which the
returns still are incomplete, the situ
aflon appeared to be as follows:

New York, Nov. 9.—Statements
were issued from both democratic
and republican national headquar
ters today still claiming the
pivotal states for the respective
parties.
"When I retired at 6 o'clock,"
said Chairman McCormick, '1
knew that North Dakota was safe
.for Wilson, California absolutely
ours, that we bad New Mexico
surely and that we are putting up
a good fight in Minnesota."
George W. Perkins at republi
can headquarters declared that
New Mexico and Minnesota were
both swinging toward Hughes and
that North Dakota was sure. He
asserted that if these three states
were placed in the Hughes column
the republican candidate's election
was assured without California's
thirteen electoral votes.
Mr. Perkins added that all pre
cautions were being taken to
guard the ballot boxes where the
vote was running close and where
the recount might be deemed
necessary.
"We will take every precaution
to guard against ballot box
frauds," he', said.
Charles B. Warren, republican
national committeeman from
Michigan, after a conference with
Chairman Willcox and other na
tional committeemen gave out this
statement as reflecting the con
sensus of opinion among the re
publican leaders:
"The election depends upon the
count in California, Minnesota^
North Dakota. New Mexico and
New Hampshire. Oregon Is safe
ly for Hughes as is also West
Virginia. The probabilities are
that the Minnesota vote will be
cast for Hughes, but the official
count will be required In North
Dakota, New Mexico, New Hamp
shire and California before the
results in those states 'will be de
finitely known."
I CALIFORNIA VOTE
I MAY BE DIVIDED
Ban Francisco, Cal., Nov. 9.—Possi
bility of a split electoral vote is not
/emote in California and especially is
It made likely because of the scratch
ing of A. J. Wallace, republican presi
dential elector, by the radical wets,
because Wallace is one of.the foremost
drys.
Should Hughes carry California
there is a possibility of Wilson taking
one vote from the state to the elecor
al college.

Republican Ticket in Iowa

Ahead of Rivals
Des Moines, Nov. 9. —Returns com
ing in slowly today failed to change to
any great degree the estimated plural
ity in Iowa for the republican presi
dential and gubernatorial candidates.
The count was going forward very
slowly in the rural districts on account
of the number of "scratched" ballots.
In the non-partisan race for justice
of the supreme court, 670 precincts out
of 2,297 gave Deemer, 26,624, Evans
24,482, and Theophilus 25,646.
For lieutenant governor 363 pre
cincts gave Moore 59,156, as against
34,770 for Doty.
For secretary of state 527 precincts
gave Noth democrat, 36,543 Allen re
publican 54,479.
For^treasurer 527 precincts gave
Hansen 32,360 Brown 57,555.
532 precincts in the race for auditor
gave Keefe, democrat 32,631 Shaw,
republican 58,489.
IOWA RESULTS.
Des Moines, Nov. 9. —The repub
licans in Iowa have a fair chance of
sending a solid delegation to congress.
Congressman Steele of the eleventh
district, the only democrat now in the
delegation, is'having a neck and neck
race with George C. Svott, republican,
and It is predicted now that it will take
the official count to determine the win
ner.
Hull won out in the second district,
one of the doubtful ones. His plurality
will be about 5,000 according to pres
ent indications.
WILSON CONFIDENT
EARLY MORNING RETURNS CON
VINCE HIM THAT HIS ELEC
TION IS ASSURED.
Long Branch, N. J., Nov. 9.—Presi
dent Wilson got up shortly before 8
o'clock this morning to hear again
that the outcome of Tuesday's election
was not yet certain. He read the
morning newspapers before breakfast
and plahned to take an automobile ride
later.
Mr. Wilson's first Questions had to
do with California, Minnesota, New
Mexico and North Dakota, the states
on which he was told before going to
bed last night, the result largely
hinged.
It was taken for granted among of
ficials here that there would be re
counts in several of the very close
states and it was believed that weeks
might pass before questions involved
were settled.
The president remained In a cheer
ful mood today and believed the re
sult would eventually favor him. As
the returns began coming in this morn
ing at the executive offices they were
promptly telephoned to him at Shadow
Lawn.
The president will leave from At
lantic Highlands, N. J., on the naval
yacht Mayflower late this afternoon or
tonight for Rhine Cliff, N. Y., on the
Hudson, where he takes a train at 10
o'clock tomorrow morning for Wil
liamstowp, Mass. There he will act
as god-father for the child of Mrs.
Francis B. Sayre, his daughter, tomor
row.
Miss Margaret Wilson, who is stay
ing at Shadow Lawn with her father,
showed particular Interest in the re
turns. Before the president was up,
Miss Wilson called to receive returns.
Early reports showing Mr. Wilson
leading In California, North Dakota
and New Hampshire, three doubtful
states, were carried by her to the pres
ident.
HUGHES IS SILENT.
New York, Nov. 9.—After studying
the election returns for two hours this
morning Charles E. Hughes went mo
toring shortly after 11 o'clock. Mrs.
Hughes accompanied him. The nom
inee declined to comment on returns.
ONE WASHINGTON
VOTE IS IN DOUBT
New York. Nov. 9.—Chairman Mc
Cormick said today he would investi
gate reports received at democratic
headquarters that the republicans in
Washington state may get one of the
democratic electoral votes on the
ground that votes cast for one of the
democratic electors who died were In
valid.
Accordingt to the reports the name
of E. M. Conner, the democratic elect
or who was substituted for A. Stream,
the dead elector, did not appear on the
ballot in many counties, and it was
stated that therefore, the votes cast
for Stream might be valid, the differ
ence giving a plurality for one repub
lican elector.
"We will investigate the matter,"
said Chairman McCormick." but even
if we were forced to concede the vote.

NORSE NOTE IS
ON WAY TO KAISER
Christiania, (Via London,) Nov. 9—
The Norwegian note replying to the
German protest against the boat or
dinance of October 13 was today de
livered to the German ambassador
here.
The controversy between Norway
and Germany over the submarine ques
tion reached an acute stage with the
passage of the ordinance of October 13
by King Haakon's government.
By this ordinance submarines of bel
ligerent powers were forbidden to tra
verse Norwegian waters except in
cases of emergency. In the latter in
stance they were directed to remain
upon the surface and fly their national
flag. Mercantile submarines were also
ordered to remain on the surface and
display their country's colors. This
ordinance provoked strong feeling in
Germany and Dr. Alfred Zimmerman,
the German under secretary for for
eign affairs was quoted in Copenhagen
papers as saying that the German note
of protest would be a serious one and
that Germany would not calmly submit
to the action of the Norwegian govern
Vacnt.

PAPERS OF PARIS

Paris Nov. 9. —The American el
tion is being followed with the de
est interest, the news having the pli
of honor in most morning paper
commentators, mindful of the' drama
lc surprise of yesterday when the
posedly certain Hughes victory
turned into possible defeat, are rein
tant to commit themselves.
The majority of the comment is
ilar to that of Stephen Piohon in
Petit Journal, who expresses the
lief that the victory of either,
date will have little effect on Am eric
policy as far as the big questions
teresting France are concerned. It
also pointed out that the present
ministration will remain in power
any event until March 4 and that:
things may happen between now
then.
The Matin remarks that while a
tory for Mr. Hughes might mean'
more vigorous international poller
would also mean a protectionist
ginie. The Matin comments that
change while unimportant in
hiiw

business interests on the return
