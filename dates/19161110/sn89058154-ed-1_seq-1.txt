The high price of all kinds of
paper i3 being investigated by
the government. It is hard to
understand why white news has
advanced from 2J to 7i cents per
pound unless there is some kind
of combine between the manu
facturers and wholesale dealers,
tt is claimed the raw material is
' as abundant and no higher than
formerly', and that paper is man
ufactured at former costs. It
looks like there is something
rotten somewhere.
It i3 conclusive that in the
northern portion of the county
the boll weevil is abundant
enough to ruin the next crop.
From advices from McNairy and
Finger, this year's crop is badly
'damaged now. In some instan
ces one half of the bolls now on
stalk have the weevil. To say
the least, there will be enough
of the breeding stock next year
to infest every crop in the
county They breed in cowpeas
and are as destructive as in cotton.
LlMEflT
The election i3 now over, , and
everyone must submit to the
voice of the people and be con
. tent The great silent wish of
the people has been recorded,
; from which there is no appeal.
Each citizen is a fraction of the
' great government of the United
States. - The government is sim
ply, the united fractions which
make up the concrete whole cen
tered into the'one opinion,, which
is the government, giving power,
. wisdom and patriotism an entity,
and expressive existence.
It ia folly to deny that boll
weevil will seriously affect the
cotton crop in this county. There
are enough now in many sections
to furnish next year a full crop
If they are not destroyed. From
the advice of those who know,
they ma be destroyed just now.
They are in and around the bolls,
leaves and stalk. They live dur
; " ing the winter in' rubbish. To
destroy the rubbish destroys
. them. This can be done by cut
ting the stalks with disc harrow
and then plowing the ground.
. They are thereby all turned up
and covered up, so that the win
i ter's cold will end them. They
gather along fence rows, old
stumps and such hiding places.
. 4 After plowing the ground, if it
can be done in November, a crop
- of winter oats should be sown,

the shortage of work stock feed
. next summer, when corn will be
worth $1.50 per bushel.
Knocked Off His Trotters
Hon. J. D. JahnBton, of Jackson,
drifted in Monday and made a speech
in the court house in the interest of
Dure and nnadulterated democracy.
They say "Joe" made a nice reason
able speech from his standpoint. At
the close, in his usual polite way he
said he would be glad for anyone to
answer his ppeech if they could,
which he did not think they could.

his lips when Clem Lea stepped to the

knew something was doing.
Clem soon warmed up to his sub
ject of answering Joe. Joe inter
rupted and said it was not fair for
him to speak without letting him
know. Clem retorted: "Keep your
seat, Joe. You askad anyone to re
ply, and I am going to do the job."
And from accounts he did the job
successfully, figuratively "chewing
him up and spitting him out," amid
the applause of the crowd. He
showed up Wilson's Mexican affairs
in a most telling manner, as only
Clem Lea can do. From the crowd
we surmise that the friends of Clem
knew what was coming and cheered
him to the echo. It was the first

STATE'S COUNTY AGENTS
HOLD ANNUAL MEETING
Reports From West Tennessee
Point to Much Valueble Farm
" Demonstration Work.
Knoxville, Tenn., Nov. 4, 1916
Fifty farm demonstration agents from
all parts of the State, meeting here
in the library of the University of
Tennessee, closed their annual session
with a statement of plans for the
coming year. More live stocK suited
to the conditions of the individual
counties will be encouraged. Com
munity meetings will be held to dis
cuss the affairs of the county and for
the purpose of getting acquainted.
Farmers will be assisted in their crop
rotations in order that all counties in
Tennessee may build np their soils.
Several counties have just employed
agents, and these men have had the
benefit of the discussions and reports
at this annual meeting. Farm dem
onstrations are one part of the ex
tension work in agriculture carried
on by the cooperation of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture, the Col
lege of Agriculture of the University
ef Tennessee, the State Board of Ed
ucation and several other organiza
tions. Once each year the entire
field force meet at Knoxville to make
their reports and to discuss plans for
the future.
H. D. Tate, state deader of county
agents, presided at the sessions and
brought before the county agents,
because of his thorough training and
experience, many valuable" sugges
tions. Reports were made by the
agents for their counties and by the
district agents for their sections of
Tennessee. H. S. Nichols is the dis
trict agent for West Tennessee, J. M.
Dean for Middle Tennessee and D. T.
Hardin for East Tennessee.
West Tennessee has made much
progress during the past year, ac
cording to the report made by Mr.
Nichols. A larger acreage is nnder
cultiuation by demonstration methods
now than ever before. Mr. Nichols
reports 1S0.000 acres all told farmed
by men who are using th best known
methods of soil cultivation. One
thousand six hundred and sixty farm
ers have devoted some part of their
farms to community demonstrations

plowing, while difficult to put into
practice, is beneficial, for on fields
that have been fall plowed, the crops
show up to much better advantage
than on other fields. About 16,500
acres in West Tennessee bavq been
fall plowed. Purebred seed has been
used in planting 3,557 cotton and
corn fields. ' The section barrow has
been used to a greater extent than
ever before, and has been successful
in keeping down weeds and grass.
The section harrow covers much more
land in accomplishing the same work
than any other implement. Legumes
have been planted by 388 men who
have worked in cooperation with the
county agents in demonstrating the
value of such crops to the county.
Crimson clover, one of these legumes,
has been hard to get this year, but
the farmers of West Tennessee are
by no means discouraged since they
realize the value of it to them. It is
used chiefly as a grazing crop in
West Tennessee.
Mr. Nichols pointed to the fact
that, with the crimson clover seed
selling at $9.00 a bushel, farmers
must save their own seed. This past
year, to the best of knowledge, over
1.000 bushels of crimson clover seed
were saved for the farms on which
they were produced. To assist the
soil in producing legumes, West Ten
nessee has imported almost 3,000
tons of limestone into the counties
having agents. For the immediate
benefit of the whole family, an ade
quate garden has been made possible
on many farms in order that the fam
ily may, from their own soil, feed
themselves.
In speaking of the live stock de
velopment of West Tennessee, Mr.
Nichols gave credit to the banks, rail
roads, business men, business men's
clubs and educators for much assist
ance. One hundred and seven pure
bred bulls, 201 purebred heifers,
3,175 purebred hogs have been
brought into counties during the past
year.- iMgbt live stock associations
have been organized, the purpose of
which is to increase the liva stock
possibilities of the counties concerned.
The improvement of gully lands,
the terracing of hillside farms, the
boys' corn clubs, and farm inspection
trips were also treated in Mr. Nich
ols' report.
