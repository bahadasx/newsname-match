official, count at its face value, there
. was no doubt this afternoon that
Woodrow Wilson and Thomas R.
Marshull had been re-elected president
and vice-president.
The republican - national committee,
however, did not view that unofficial
count as closing what has been in mnny
respects the most bewildering complex
teotion in tho history of the nation.
A conference of tl. O. P. chieftains
who gathered at the headquarters short
ly before noonwas still in session at
1:30 presuinnbly mapping out tho states
in which the party intends to institute
proceedings for a recount, or possible
court proceedings. A formal state
ment, issued by them with the ap
proval of Governor Hughes, declared
that result of the election could not be
considered until tho official counts!
competed. They pointed out that
many of the returns so far tabulated
are unofficial and nlrcady many mis
takes having important 1 results have
liivn found. They said they felt they
"owed it to the American people" to
see that an absolutely accurate and
honest count is made. The leaders ex
pected the official count to be com
pleted by next MVnday. Those in the
conference, included: Chnirmnn Will-

The complete figures on these precincts,
as tabulated by the I'nited Press at an

the president without qualification. He
admitted that California had apparently
gone democratic on the face of almost

"Becnuso of substantial errors al'

he said, "it is seen to be quite possible
to change the apparent result of the

complete outward calmness, despite

slept late. At 9:30 he had not -ordered

New York, Nov. 10. Woodrow Wil
sou apparently has been elected presi
dent without the votes of the hereto
fore supposedly iudispensible states of
I New York, Indiaua and Illinois. He has
'seemingly won without aid from three

Only two other presidents have beeu

that there wer lean years ahead for

and recognition by the administration
is concerned.
It Is generally believed that on Tam
many Hall will fall the hardest blow
since from dawn of election day the
president's friends had a hunch that
the Murphyitea would knife Wilson.
The tremendous city majority which
Tammany promised Wilson failed dis
mally to materialize.
Of scarcely less interest ainone poli
ticians today than discussion of Hughes
apparent defeat even though carrying
New York, Indiana and Illinois, was
what happened in California, it was
agreed that Hnghes must havo suffered
a tremendous rutting there, since Gov
ernor Hiram Johnson, senatorial nomi
nee on the same ticket and idol of the
progressives, ran nearly 300,000 ahead
of him. Apparently the nroiressives
threw most of their strength to Wilson.
All of whirs, recalled to republicans
today the direful predictions, which
were made at the time of Governor
Hashes' campaign tour of California,
due to "kidnaping of the nominee by
a republican faction which sought to
"rreeze out" tne progressives.

Now that the election is over, a sum
marizing of the principal features of
Governor Hughes' tour of California by

In the first place, they play politics
