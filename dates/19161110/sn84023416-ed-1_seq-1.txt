Archie Riggie, a Boy 16 Years
Old, Was Shot and Instantly
Killed on Railroad Street In
vestigation By State's Attorney
and Attorney General.
Archie Riggie, 16 years old, a son
of John Riggie, was shot and almost
instantly killed Wednesday night on
Railroad street in a tenement of Miss
Vina Mousseau. Doctors Elie and
Sargent were summoned but the lad
lived only a few moments after their
arrival.
This tragedy is the outcome of a
quarrel, somewhat of the nature of
a family fued and a drunken brawl,
but the victim was not one of the
parties engaged and, as is quite often
the case, was an innocent party.
There are many reports as to the
trouble leading up to the shooting,
all of which may have more or less
truth, but are lacking in the real
facts in the case. There was a row,
bad blood was shown, threats were
made and finally a revolver was
brought into play and a lad paid the
penalty with his life. Archie was
standing near the door in the tene
ment of Mrs. Stanly when the bul
lets struck him. Two shots were
fired, one entering the side of the
neck just below the ear, and the
other passing through the heart, the
bullets came near hitting Mrs.
Stanley.
Deputy Sheriff E. A. Bemis was
summoned and was soon on the
scene. He immediately got the
State's attorney, Claire R. Powell,
and a hasty investigation was made.
Thursday forenoon Attorney Gen
eral Barber of Brattleboro and Dr.
B. H. Stone of the State Laboratory
of Hygiene at Burlington arrived
and an investigation followed, con
tinuing today. At this hearing the
parties undergoing investigation
were represented by J.RolfeSearles,
attorney of St. Johnsbury.
The funeral of this young man
was held this morning at the Roman
Catholic church of St. James the
Greater.

National, State and Representative Vote in Essex County
The following is from the Brattle
boro daily paper and relates an in
teresting experience of Congressman
Dale and Ex.-Gov. Howe in a cross
county trip during'the recent campaign.
A young buck deer jumped in
front of Maj. Linn D. Taylor's auto
mobile luesday night, Ost. 31, as he
was driving towards Newfane from
Townshend with Frank E. Howe and
Congressman Porter H. Dale, who
had addressed a rally m Townshend.
The party had reached a point a
short distance south of balmon Hole
ridsre when the animal suddenly ap
peared, attracted by the lights of
the machine. Maj. Taylor did his
best to stop the machine, but as the
deer spiang aside the left wheel and
spring struck the animal and ran
over him.
He was evidently badlv iniured.
There was no knife of sufficient size
and strength in the party with which
the animal might be put out of bis
misery, so they lifted him into the
tonneau. where he occunied a Dlac.e
of honor with the two distinguished
sons 01 Vermont and rode 'n state to
Newfane.
There they aroused Game Warden
George P. Alexander and gave the
animal into his keepinjr. Mr. Alex
ander killed it because of its injuries
and disposed of the carcass for $3
There will be a game supper in New
fane in the near future.

JOHN W. THURSTON
Tuesday, election day, was fair, an
ideal Fall day in Vermont. It was
very quiet, no excitement although
a large number were at the polls.
Brighton had three candidates for
representative, yet there was none
of the keen interest usually shown
in such contests. The voters were
orderly and everything passed off
with a precision characteristic of a
busy people.
Only one ballot was necessary for
the election of representative. The
vote follows:
Representative, John S. Sweeney,
Republican, 209; James R. Applebee,
Democrat, 83; Elias A. Bemis, Inde
pendent Republican, 32. The union
tickets of Justices made up of E. M.
Bartlett, J. S. Sweeney, E. E. Davis,
George L. Dyer, E. J. Parsons, T. F.
Butler, C. E. Foss, W. A. Gleeson,
C. 1'. Streete, J. W. Thurston, was
elected without opposition. On the
county ticket George A. Hubbard,
Republican, received 185 votes, and
Michael J. Dowd, Democrat, 111.
The other candidates of both parties
on this ticket received nearly the
same vote. On the state ticket
Graham, Republican, received 173
votes for governor; Mayo, Demo
crat, 131. For U. S. senator, Page,
Republican, had 192 votes; Miller,
Democrat, 132. For Congressman,
Dale, Republican, 217; Pape, Demo
crat, 95. For President, Hughes
146, Wilson 174.
Congressman Dale received the
largest vote of any candidate at the
Brighton polls.
