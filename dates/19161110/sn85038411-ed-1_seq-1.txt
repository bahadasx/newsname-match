Two short term prisoners escaped
from the Dauphin county jail between
6:40 and 6 o'clock this morning. They
were Edward Howard, aged 32 years
and W. L. Headrick, 20 years,'serving
six and seven months respectively,
each on a charge of larceny. Both
were "trusties' and had the run of the
jail, working in the "oakery and elec
trical departments.
Getting out of jail was not a hard
task for the prisoners, who, it is be
lieved had planned their escape some
time ago. The most difficult work
they had to do was break with an
Iron bar two Yale locks, each of which
held iron doors leading from the coal
bin on the west side of the jail into
Court street.
During yesterday and last evening
Headrick borrowed money from
other prisoners saying he was to get
a check to-day and would pay it back.
The Ksoape
Both Howard and Headrick were
committed by the city police depart
ment. They were committed without
their Bertillon measurements or finger
print being taken, and this, it is be
lieved, makes their recapture almost
an impossibility, as they only have to
change their clothing to make identifi
cation difficult. The police have no
photographs to send broadcast, so as
"You Understand Me" Windsor, sup
erintendent of detectives might say—
There you are!
Headrick occupied ceil No. 1 on the
- right side of the jail, lower tloor, with
four other prisoners. Howard was

PAT.DOG WITH PRINCETON j]
DEGREE, THE FRIEND OF
PRESIDENT WILSON—DEAD
I
"He died at the clore of a stirring day,
A day that will live in story;
In a tear-wet torub we laid hif. clay,
And left him alone with his glory."
"Pat," said to be the only dog in the
world with a degree from Princeton
University, is dead.
"Pat," bull terrier of many a bloody
fray, l'ought his last fight to-day with
an automobile—and the automobile
won.
i "Pat" was aged 13 years and a few
months. He was the property of Dr.
John 11. Fager, Sixth and Verbeke
streets. When Dr. Fager's son. Paul
Fager, went to college at Princeton he
took "Pat" with him. "Pat" was in
about all the college activities possible
during his four years' residence at the
university and when young Fager left
school wtih his sheepskin "Pat" was

dent did not come ashore until 9.50
I o clock to take his train for Williams
town, where he goes to act as god
l father for the second child of his
| daughter, Mrs. F. B. Sayre.
I Throngs lined the river bank, many
carrying American flags and when
the Mayflower's launch, carrying the
; President and Mrs. Wilson was seen
j to put off from the yacht, the crowd
rushed excitedly toward the landing
jto greet them. Enthusiastic cheers
went up as the President and liis wife
| assisted by Captain Jerry, of the May
j flower, stepped ashore.
The President's face was wreathed
l in smiles. Ho looked completely
happy. He had received by wireless
j the word that he had been re-elected.
; He raised his hat and waved it to
the crowd as he and Mrs. Wilson set J
out on foqt for the railroad station
rearby.

shore safely.
I given one, too, and it has hung framed i
above his favorite chair in the home |
■ of Dr. Fager ever since his graduation. J
"Pat" was graduated at 1907 and was
a personal friend of President Wood- .
row Wilson, then president of the |
i university. Wilson patted "Pat" on j
' the head after the graduation exer- j
! eises.
| The terrier several years ago made j
J .1 valiant attempt to save the life of
; Howard Easter, a drowning boy.
! "Pat" grabbed the struggling lad by
| his shirt collar, but the collar tore
while he was towing the boy to shore
I and the don was unable to reach him
j again in time to save his life.

by newspapermen that Mr. Hughes!
would not to-day send congratulations :

Mr. Green.
Mr. Hughes declined to make any i
comment upon the election results. He j
rose about 8 o'clock and after read-!
, ing the newspapers went for an auto
mobile ride. He was apparently in
I cheerfu: spirits.
Jt was expected at his hotel that he
j would receive a. visit during the day
i from Republican National Chairman
! Willeox and one or two other partv j
• leaders, probably after the conference
!at Republican headquarters, set fori
! the noon hour, on the question of a j
] recount of the vote in close States. |
This matter Mr. Hughes was leasing
entirely in the hands of his campaign
j managers, although before taking j
definite action it was expected they I
j would consult with him to learn his'
I views. j
