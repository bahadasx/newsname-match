Election of Interest Abroad
The American elections occupy
leading positions in both the news
and editorial columns of the Lon
don papers and the war news finds
itself crowded into a secondary po
sition for the first time since the
outbreak of the war.
The papers devote from one to
five columns to what they call the
"American election puzzle." Some
of the editorials stretch into nearly
two columns in an endeavor to ex
plain the whys and wherefores of
the dramatic finish to the campaign.
In the'streets, hotels and clubs little
else but the election is discussed
and the bulletin boards are scanned
by eager crowds in search, not of
war communiques, but of the latest
election news.
It is evident, as the papers point
out, that this presidential contest
has been followed with more inter
est in Great Britian than any since
the republic was founded and that
the man in the street has, as never
before, made himself acquainted
with the issuses involved and with
the personalities of the candidates.
The editorials generally empha
size, as they have repeatedly during
the past two months, that the elec
tion, whatever its issue, is not like
ly to affect to any marked degree
the foreign policy of the United
States or its attitude toward the
Camp File Girls
The Camp Fire Girls met at the
church parlor Friday Nov. 3. The
meeting was called to order by
Assistant Guardians Anna Long and
Grace Florance. Business matters
were then discussed and several
things planned for the coming win
ter. The next meeting will be held
Friday Nov. 17. All members are
requested to be present as it is a
ceremonial meeting.

Two Wrecks
The helper engine jumped the
track last Friday night while
going up the hill between Kendrick
and Troy. The track was torn up
for quite a distance and the passen
ger train which was due to arrive
here ai 9:05 p. m. was delayed un
til afternoon of the following day.
The wreck was caused by the rails
spreading.
Sunday morning two box cars
loaded with flour were shoved off
the track near the bridge below the
Farmers Warehouse. One car roll
ed over the bank, smashing the top
and spilling 250 sacks of flour.
The brakeman was thrown from the
top of the car into the Potlatch
creek, the'roof of the car falling on
him. He was quite seriously
bruised and was sent to a Spokane
hospital.

of Mr. and Mrs. A. R. Shumaker

| Lloyd g . Weeks of Carter> Montana
and Miss. Evelyn A. Cochran of
.Pullman, Washington, were united
in marrage. The ceremony waa

Killed by Train
James W. Woolley, age 51, of
W709 Jackson avenue, well known
railroad man, is dead as result of a
fall between two cars at Lewiston,
Idaho, at 3 o'clock Sunday morning.
Both legs were crushed, and he
died on the way to a hospital. He
leaves his widow, at the home in
Spokane, and a daughter, Florence
Woolley, who went to Sacramento,
Cal., about a month ago. He also
leaves a mother at Boscobel, Wis.,
and a brother at Bloomington, Wis.
The Dairyman Who Reads
The dairyman who is making the
most money today is the dairyman
who is reading a great deal and
keeping up with the best methods
of the times. Information passes
from one person to another so slow
ly by word of mouth that if a man
had to depend on that method of
getting information he would con
tinue to follow the methods of his
ancestors more often than not. If
word of mouth is depended on the
ancestor had the advantage, and in
the past this advantage has led to
the young dairyman following in
the footsteps of the old dairyman.
The dairyman who reads can get
out of the ruts, and it is necessary
many times to get out of the ruts if
money is to be made by means of
the cow and her product. In the
dairy business the margin between
profit and loss is not great, and by
a little wrong method the cow-keep
er can easily make a loss instead of
a gain. If losses are continued
from year to year it means a failure
m the end. The farmer who reads
seldom fails in the dairy business.—
The Great Southwest Farmer.
The latest returns available yes
terday show a majorty vote for
prohibition in Montana.
Returns From The State
Yesterday the count showed out
of 552 of the 734 precincts in Idaho,
Wilson had 59,467 votes against
46,205 for Hughes, a plurality of
13,262 for Wilson.
The race for governor will have
to be settled by official count, for
Alexander, democrat, has now a
lead of only 1237. Alexander has
52,458 against 51,221 for Davis,
republican-.
A compilation of over one-third
of the vbte of the state shows the
following on lieutenant governor
and secretary of state:
Lieutenant governor—Holt, re
publican, 27.215; Parker, democrat,
26,813.
Secretary of state—Barker, re
publican, 18,718; Dougherty, dem
ocrat, 20,669.
The remainder of the vote is run
ning along with about the same
division between the republican and
democratic candidates.
The vote indicates the defeat of
Barker for secretary of state, while
it is practially assured that Rice has
defeated Dunn for the supreme
court.
Latah County Results
The returns from the precincts
of Latah county show that all of
the republican ticket was elected
with the exception of four offices:
Prosecuting attorney, Moore; pro
bate judge, Morgareidge; treasur
er, Ruth Broman; sheriff, Camp
bell. It will probably be necessary
to get the official count before the
race between Lewis and Kean can
be definitely decided, although
Lewis leads by a narrow margin.
With few exceptions none of the
victories were decisive. All the
races were close.

Oregon that he had learned of the
death of George Craig. He was

about sixteen years of age. His
death occurred about a month ago.
Pneumonia was the cause.
