RAI I TEAM
Dnlih 1 Ert III
Two Great Games, in Ala-
mogordo and Tularosa
Local Team Loses Both, But
More Determined Than Ever
S0M: GOOD GAMES
IN NEAR FUTURE!
Tho Carrizozo Girls' Basket
Ball Team, accompanied by Mrs.
T. A. Spencer, the coach, and II.
C. Franklin, the manager, loft
Carrizozo on No. 3 Saturday
noon and played two games, ono
with Tularosa in tho early after
noon, and one with Alamogordo
in the Amusement Hall of the
latter place that evening. Tula
rosa was invincible, having a
big, malured team of seasoned
veterans, who know tho game
from A to L. So the score of 21
to 8 was unavoidable, though the
little Carrizozans never relaxed
their efforts until tho referee s
whistle announced that it was all
over. Alamogordo people were
there in autos, and the players
left with them immediately for
the Big Cottonwoods. That
night Baw a very tired bunch of
Carrizozo players lacing a strong
ly reinforced Alamo delegation
on a floor to which tho former
wcro net accustomed. Alamo
gordo worked line, while Carrij
zozo kept doing her best, but
that was just enough to hold the
Alamogordo tearr to 17 points,
while they contrived to score 0.
Thus Alamogordo got revenge in
crand style, and epHinoo.m rjm
high 'to sec the downfall oi uie
team which had hitherto always
administered crushing defeat to
the team from the larger school.
The Carrizozo girls are enthus
iastic over tho superior prowess
of their opponents, and, whereas
they are naturally handicapped
on account of size, they are de
termined to improve their tactics
wherever possible. Regular
practice continues daily. At
both places tho teams were
courteously treated, and greatly
enjoyed their Btay. They were
fairly beaten and feel no chagrin.
They will meet the Lincoln Coun-
tv I Ilcrli Rplmnl hunch itf. PniiHnn

Tularosa delegation on the home

nn nd mission f co of 25c. will be
charged. Don't fail to come out
; and encourage the team on this
l occasion with your presence and
imuuciui support.
SAFETY FIRST
As Carrizozo is getting a good
many automobiles, tho following
rules, if carried out, may help to
avert accidents:
Look both ways before you
cross tho street. It's better to
be safe than sorry.
Cross streets ONLY at cross
ings. The short cut may bo a
short cut? to the hospital.
Drivers of vehicles should be
always on tho lookout for pedes
trians and for children.
Motorcyclists should go slow
'round corners and on slippery
walks, and ALWAYS watch for
children.
Most accidents happen at street
crossings. Be careful at the
crossings.
Don't try to dodge ahead of an
automobile. Maybe tho driver
isn't a careful one.
RED CROSS SEAL STANDING
As we go to press, we learn
with chagrin that in tho matter
of the sale of Red Cross Seals
last year, tho Sovereign State of
faew Mexico made a very poor
showing indeed.
For purposes of compahison
tho National Association has di
of the- Union
into three groups, according to
population, and then figured out
the sales per capita of population,
and out of a lidt of eighteen
States in our class, we como sev
enteenth. There is no reason why New
Mexico should not be at the top
of the heap in this, as in most
other things. That can be
brought about if all will help.
Those desiring information about
tho seals before they go on sale
in Carrizozo, should address The
I Red Cross Seal, Box 457, Albu-
querque, New Mexico.
