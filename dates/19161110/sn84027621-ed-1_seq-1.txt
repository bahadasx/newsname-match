WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE MARION COUNTY FAIR
There seems to be many things
that those -who should be most inter
ested in the fair do not know.
First, a county fair is not a money
making proposition as many sup
pose, and cannot live and be a success
and pay cash dividends.
The dividends that a countv fair
- - "
pays to community can only be
measurea py us success, and a suc
i ' ,
cessful fair brings equal advantage to
the farmer and the merchant, each in
their own way.
We all like to be shown and not
take hearsay for fact. Good exhibits
at your fair will prove two things:
What your county can produce and
the backbone of the citizens of that
county. .fv-v :S:r :V.;; -'A-
Strangers will judge by, your fair
either in person or thru the report of
same which travels farther than you
dream. The first the writer ever
heard or knew of Marion county was
from the report of your first annual
fair. This report contained in a little
paper sent from Palatka traveled
6ver 1700 miles to tell its story and
was read with much surprise and in
terest by ten of the leading business
men in a city of over 150,000. It pays
to advertise your resources if you
would increase the value of your lands
and add to your population, thus in
creasing the volume of business for

your business men. Good advertising
(and there is none equal to a success
ful fair) then, means increased profit
for the farmer and business man
equally. That is your dividend.
Charge the r expense of conducting
your fair to advertising, and then be
thankful if you break even.
But remember that your fair will
pay dividends and be a success just to
the extent that the merchant and far
mer give it their support, because co
operation is the secret of a successful
fair. : No fair can be a success with
a bunch of eitizens here and there
trying to pull-away with it. It must
be a ready, alltogether pull.
The list of the fairs in the different
states grows larger each year, and
they are being recognized by the gov
ernment as being its strongest aid in
working for the betterment of the
rural community. "
-When a community that has been
accustomed to hapng a county fair
closes its gates, it is a sure sign that
that community is in an ailing condi
tion at least, and will have to hustle
to keep from dying. "
We feel it is only justice to the
people of Marion county to tell them
how very near old Marion's fair
ground gates came to remaining clos
ed this year. ; ; ,
The management had done the very
best they could, giving their time and
in some cases their money to make
the fair a success, but in spite of all

Imperial Government Assures Ameri
ca Sinking of the Marina will
be Closely Looked Into,
(Associated Press) '
Washington, NoTr 10. Germany
has informed the American embassy
at Berlin that the sinking of the Brit
ish steamer Marina on October 28th
with - the loss of six American lives
will be thoroughly investigated
. j - ,- .
soon as the submarines operating on
that date report, according to confi
dential advices received here from
Berlin. - - ,
their efforts it "was impossible to pay
any on the mortgage hanging over
the grounds.
How many know that with the ex-
ception of the secretary, the officers
of the fair and the executive board
attend meeting after meeting during
the year, giving their time and thought
to the fair work, many times neglect
ing their business to do so, and with
out any recompense or even , appre
ciation. Last year the fair paid its
own way, but was not able to pay the
interest on the mortgage and the per
manent improvements. However, the
banks came to the rescue once more
and offered to increase the loan to
cover: the indebtedness: but still we
were handicaped as we had no money
for running expenses. Then eleven
men who were reluctant to see the
fair" ground gates closed, went down
m their pockets and put up $50 each
to pay running expenses that the fair
might continue to live. V .".
Why, you ask, do these men do
this ? Because they had too much
pride in Marion . county to have the
report go out that she had been ob
liged to close her fair ground gates.
What do these men get out of the
fair, did you ask? A lot of work and
trouble and cussing that- the rest of
the population of the county little
dream of, and just the same benefit
that any Marion county citizen gets
out of a good fair. No more and no
less. . '. ' '':
Each loyal citizen of Marion county
should be ready to give a vote of
thanks' to these loyal men who came
to the rescue, preventing the calamity
which a discontinuance of our fairs
would mean to the county. For when
ever we must give up our fair it is
time to engage some one to write the
obituary for Marion county for she
will be just about dead to advance
ment and progress, and her reputa
tion as the banner county of the, state
will be a thing of the past.
My friend, if you are living in Mar
ion county, obtaining food and shelter
from her resources, it is up to you to
stand by her, for she is your best
friend, and the more loyal you are to
your work, whatever it may be, the
greater will be your reward. Do not
be deceived by the thought that what

you do now is only for this day,
month or year. No work well done is
ever lost and you or others will reap
the result in years to come. And just
as surely will disloyalty and ; poor
work leave its blot and cause you or
yours to suffer later on.
So come to the rescue of your coun
ty. -Help us by your presence and
your exhibits, but most of all by your
feeling of good fellowship, to make
this fair such a great success that
there can be no thought of closing its
gates in 1917.
Remember there is a $4000 mort
gage on our fair grounds, and it has
been the .constant thought of those
who bore the burden of economizing
in order to pay off this mortgage to
save every dollar possible. '
So should you be tempted to think
wc have not been generous or to call
us a cheap bunch this year, just bear
in mind that it has not been our pleas
ure but a painful duty to cut down on
expenses as 'we have been compelled to
do, in order to save for Marion county
her good name, by making it possible
to continue the county fair.
Don't find fault with us and roc
the boat. Jump in and help row.
Your fruit, corn, oats, rice, cotton,
hay, hogs, cattle, sheep everything
that a generous providence has bless
ed you with this year should be used
as an oar in willing hands to help us
row the Marion County Fair boat
away from the rocks and to a place
of safety and success. Bring them in.
Help boost! You will be surprised how
you will boost your own interests in
boosting your, county.
Let every one help. Men with
teams have donated them and men to
help in clearing up the grounds. The
banks have offered the services of
one man from each bank, the board of
ade the secretary's assistance and
Mr. W. T. Gary his services for at
east two days. The above help
gratis in order to save expense.
Now we ask the people throughout
the county for their Presence, Pro
ducts and Patience. Their presence
