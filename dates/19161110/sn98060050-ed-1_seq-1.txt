DASHED UPON ROCKS
Mrs. Andrew J. Swenson Thrown
from Bridge in Runaway
Died in Memorial Hospital Wednesday
Evening Husband Injured in Jump
lng to Her Assistance:
Mrs. Andrew J. Swenson of -12 Fairview
street was fntally hurt in a runaway ac
cidcat when sho.-jyo' hurled from a car
liage over the railing of the Klliot street
bridge "Wednesday and struck on tlio
rocks under the shallow water in lict-
stono brook. Her husband, who was
tluown out of tho carnage in which they
were riding and who instantly jumped
from the bridgq to the rescue of his wife,
has a severe cut over one eye and other
111.11111, none of which aro dangerous.
Mr. and Mrs. Swenson were elderly
people and Mr. Swenson has a milk
loute. llie.v were driving down the in
cline from lloldcn & Martin's mill yaid
tb the west end of tho Klliot street bridge
when some part of the harness broke and
the hoi'bc tan.
Mr. Swenson tried to turn him on to
the bridge, but the lartiaco struck the
further corner and Mrs. Swenson was
thrown over the low railing to the bed of
tho brook below. Mr. Swonson was
pinned under tho carriage for a 1110
ment, but as eye witnesses welo hurrying
to his aid he managed to ciawl out, lookcti
over the tailing and leaped to the aid of
his wife, a downwaid plunge into shallow
water on a rocky bottom of nearly 25 feet.
.1. L. Ibistol, who conducts: a small stoic
al the coiner of Klliot and Williams streets,
saw the accident and hunicd to the aid of
the couple. When lie reached the spot
Mr. Swenson was 111 tho water nearly
tn his waist, blood stieaming ft 0111 a long
cut over one. eye. He was slowly dragging
his wife from tho water.
Mr. liristol was obliged to go along the
bank several tods before being able to
climb down to -Mr. bwenson's aid. To
gothor tho two men laid Mrs. Swenson
on tho bank, alio was bleeding profusely
from several cuts anil wounds, but le
gainetl conKciousncss for n .few moments
while awaiting tho arrival of the ainbu
lance.
It iciuiietl feeveial men to get the
stietcher down to the spot where Mis.
Swenson had been laid on the bank and
to bear her up to the stiect. She was bur
ricd to the hospital, wheie Dr. ficoigc It.
Andorson was awaiting her arrival. She
died there about G o'clock that oven
ing.
The carriage wan smashed, but the
horse, nfter struggling to his feet, le
ninined on the bridge until someone had
time to take him to a near-by stable. The
animal was cut and scratched, but was
not surioutdy injured.
Mrs. Swenson was born in Sweden
.Inn. 27, 1815, and enme to this conn
try when n young woman. Th family
moved irom Keono, Js. II.. to Hrattlc

THE RESULT.
The election Tuesday was peculiar to
itself, as tho advertisements used to say
about the patent medicines. It was a
time when party lines woro not fol
lowed closely and when prophets had
Httlo to figure upon. The Mew .Eng
land states with tho possible exception
of Now Hampshire, supported tho Re
publican ticket, and New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Iowa and
other states rolled up immenso majori
ties for Mr. Hughes. Starting with the
solid South back of him, and gaining a
bunch of tho western states, where the
results were almost invariably close,
Mr. Wilson looked like a winner Ir.st
night, although there was still a possi
ble chance for Charles E. Hughes to pull
through. It is diOicult to liguro all the
varied influences which were factors in
this campaign. It is only fair to say
that the personality of Woodrow Wil
son was the greatest asset of tho De
mocracy. Hughes was undoubtedly
the strongest candidate tho Republi
cans could have named, but tho tido was
against him by a very narrow margin.
There is one fact about tho election
this year that will be a source of grati
fication everywhere. Tho result, with
cither Wilson or Hughes in tho White
House will not disrupt business. To our
mind Wilson's foroign policy lias been
weak and vacillating, and his actions
in relation to Mexico havo been a so
ries bf blunders, but if tho American
people have given him an endorsement,
as now seems probable, there is noth
ing to do but to accept tho result
philosophically and to bo thankful
that wo did not got some Democratic
leader like Bryan or Champ Clark.
J. Weslcv Miller, who has represent
ed Bethel four terms in tho legislature
as a Democrat, was beaten 249 to 11 1
by John S. Kimball, a merchant. Mil
ler has been a highly creditable repre
sentative.
Congratulations to tho town of Peru.
It elected Asa Brown, Republican, ns
representative in tho general assembly.
This means Hint his opponent, Marshall
J. Ilapgood, will not occupy a largo
part of the time of the legislature with
his speeches.
The local option law is certainly
working welt in New Hampshire-. Ches
hire and Sullivan counties, which
have populous towns closo to the bor
der of Vermont, voted dry in ovory
town for tho first timo sineo the pres
ent law went into effect.
Congressman Prank L. Orceiio litis rea
son for gratification at the vote given
him in his homo city, it being larger
than cast for aiiv other candidate, St.
Albans gave 515 votes for Wilson to
18 i for Hughes. All of tho state and
county candidates on tho Republican
ticket received a majority in St. Al
bans. Kipling's oft-quoted lines "For cast
is east and west is west and never the
twuin shall meet" applies to a certain
oxtent in tho presidential vote. Tho
Now Kngland states, with tho possible
exception of Now Hampshire, nnd Now
York, Now Jersey and Pennsylvania
caino through strongly for .Mr.
Hughos, but tho western states which
wore formerly considered strongly Re
publican went for Wilson, although in
several eases the vote was extremely
closo. '
Robert W. Simonds, chairman of tho
industrial accident board, who was n
senator from Caledonia comity two
years ago, fell outsido the breastworks
in his run for town representative in
St. Johusbury, being beaten by C. M.
Whitney, a Democrat. Simonds would
easily have been one of tho ablest and
most influential members of tho house,
Wo never heard of M'r. Whltnoy bo

tions in tho sealo town which wqro fac
tors .to nn extent not understood to the

WILSON PROBABLY THE WINNER
Result Had Not Been Definitely Determined Last Night
Owing to Close Vote in Five States
The indications last evening, Thurs
day, were that Woodrow Wilson, Demo
crat, had been re-elected to the pres
idency of the United States, defeating
Charles 13. Hughes of New York by a
narrow margin. Tho result was still
called in doubt in many newspaper of
fices, but tho chances were certainly
favorable for Wilson.
The table in another column shows
how tho states voted. New Hampshire
had been classed as Republican until
yesterday, when, on tho face of tho re
turns, Wilson was apparently tho vic
tor by 117 plurality. A recount will
be made.
California, Minnesota, North Dakota
and New Mexico were still in doubt.
In a total vote of almost half a million
in California, Wilson was leading
Hughes by less than C,000, and in Minn
esota, with a total vote of over 141,000,
Hughes was leading by a little more
than 800. In North Dakota Wilson was
in first place about GOO votes. New
Mexico was also close, but with Hughes
leading. With Now Hampshire given
to the Democrats it will bo necessary
for Hughes to win both Minnesota and

Less than a dozen former representa
tives were returned to tho Vermont
legislature in tho elections Tuesday.
This constant rotation in office gives
recognition to more men, but it
docs not bring out the highest possible
efficiency in office. A man who goes
back to tho legislature for a second or
third term is far bettor equipped than
tho novice in public affairs. Wo can re
call several cases where small towns
havo given reprofentatives repeated
elections with tho result that tlieso
towns have had influence far beyond
that of the city and large towu com
munities. HEAD BLOWN OFF WITH IUFLE.
William P. Conger, Burlington Taxi
dermist, Committed Suicido Friday
Morning in His Home.
William I'. Conger, 00, widely known

chester lido. He hnd been despond

Tlio explosion of tho guu was not

ribly mangled body. Ho left n uoto to
his wife, but tho contents huvo not

prominent officer in tho Knights of
Pythias.
California and ono of the smaller states
to get tho election. By winning either
Minnesota or California Wilson would
be elected.
Tho Democrats retained their hold 011
tho United States senate. The Repub
licans made gains in thu national house
of representatives, but whether these
woro sufficient to givo them a majority
there was not fully determined.
Hughes carried New York state by
over 100,000, Now Jersey by 53,001),
Illinois by over 150,000, and in several
other states had a big load. Ohio went
for Wilson by about 25,000.
For tlio first timo in the history of
tho country a woman was chosen a
member of congress, Miss Jcanotto Ran
kin winning in Montana running as a
Republican, while tho other lncmber of
congress from that stato is a Demo
crat. On Wednesday morning almost every
paper in tho country announced
Hughes's election. This statoment was
based 011 tho fact that ho had carried a
large part of tho eastern and middle
western states except Ohio. Tho later
returns showed close contests and left
the result in doubt.
HUGHES RAN BEHIND.
Had Load of 16,500 in Vermont Gra
ham Governor by 26,000 Senator
Pago Ran Ahead of Ticket.
Revised and nearly complete returns
from Tuesday's election in Vermont
show that Charles U. Hughes carried
this state bv a plurality of approxi
mately 111,000. Horace F. (Jrahiim, Re
publican, gubernatorial candidate, beat
his Democratis opponent, William B.
Mayo, by a plurality exceeding 20,000.
With till but 20 small nnd isolated

Carroll S. Pago was re-elected by a
plurality of about 30,000 over Oscar t'.
Miller and the two congressmen, Frank
I. Greene and Porter H. Dale, Repub
licans, were returned by largo majori
ties. The legislature will have a sen
ate without n Democrat among the 30
members. With 27 constituencies unre
ported the house of representatives will
contain ISO Republicans anil 35 Demo
crats. Corrected and viitually complete re
turns show that though Hughes carried
the state by a plurality of 10,500, ho
inn far behind the Republican candi
dates for governor and United States
senator. With only 10 towns unrc
poitcd by noon out of its 216 cities and
towns tlie vote was Hughes, 3S,251;
Wilson, 21.S32. The samo precincts
gave for governor, Graham, 11,312;
Mayo, Democratic, 1 1,031). The voto for
United States senator was Page, Re
publican, 13,500; Miller, Democratic,
13,02(1. The state senate will be entire

PROHIBITION VICTORY.
State-Wide Dryness Voted in Fivo
States in tlio Elections Tuesday Mis
oouri and California Wet.
Tho Anti-Saloon headquarters in
Ohio Wednesday reported it had infor
mation that the dry forces had won
state-wide prohibition fights in livo
states at Tuesday's election. The states
named were Michigan, Montana, South
Dakota, Utah and Nebraska. Michigan,
it is estimated, went dry by 80,000.
With the addition of these states, anti
saloon league officials stated that 24
states, one-hnlf the union, arc now in
the dry column.
The overwhelming1 "any" voto in
St. Louis apparently defeated the
state-wide prohibition proposition in
Missouri by more than three to one.
With the total voto of St. Louis and
Kansas City reported and few rural
votes in the count was 40,501 for nnd
173,785 against prohibition. St. Louis
voted 13,272 for the proposition ami
1 10,000 against. Kansas City, which
five years ago gave a majority of nl
most three to ono ngaiust the proposi
Hon, this year voted 31,000 for and
30,000 against.
A tremendous vote in San Francisco
tippetl the beam Into Wednesday
against stale amendment No. 2 iin
posing rigid restrictions .on the sale
and use of alcoholics. There had boon
a good majority for the proposition all
day. The S.in Fianeison majority

"Pursy with Prido."
(Rutland Herald.)
Burlington now calls its union depot
a Grand Central station in miniature,
and White River Junction netuully
gazes on the progress of the now sub

joint station. Thus tho world do move.
