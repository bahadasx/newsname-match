CHARLES . EVANS HUGHES
The Man, As A Citizen. As A Gover
nor As A Justice of The Supreme
, Court His Conception of The
Presidency.
Charles Evans Hughes, who may be
the next president of the United
Mates is the only son oX a Baptist i giving to Almighty God for His mani
. minister. Rev David Charles Hughes i fold mercies and blessings to us as
and Mary Catherine Connelly Hughes,
descendant of Scotch-Irish and
Dutch ancestors who settled in New
York In preRevolutionary days.
He was born at Glenn Falls, N. Y.,
April 11th, 1862 his early education
was obtained in the public schools f
New York; collegiate education in Col
gata University, Hamilton, N. Y. and
Brown University, Providence, R I.
From this last named school he was
graduated in 1881. . Following his
graduation from Brown 'he taught
Greek and Mathmatics in Delaware
Academy at Delhi, N. Y., at the same
time taking up the study of law in
the office of Judge Gleason of that
county ' seat town. He entered Col
ombia Law School in 1882 and was
graduated from that school in 1884
being admitted to the New York Bar
in that ame year. ,; ' ! , -
He bejyan as a clerk in the law Arm
of Chamberlain, Carter and Horn,
blower; in 1887 he became a member
of this same firm which was known
as Carter, Hughes and Cravath, (,
December 5th, 1888 he was united
in marriage . with Miss Antoinette
Carter and four children, one son
and three daughters have been born
to them. 7,
Mr. Hughes continued in the prac
tice of law in New York city until
1891, when he accepted an appoint
ment as professor of law in Cornell
University,' which he rilled for two
years at the end of which time he re
turned to New York and resumed his
law practice at the same time con
tinuing as a special lecturer on law
t Cornell University, he was re
garded as one of the foremost coun
sel in the city, enjoying a general
practice, without political ambition
and always retaining complete per
sonal independence.
His first entry into public life oc
curred when he was appointed counsel
to, the Stevens Gas Investigating
Committee in 1905. This committee
was appointed by the legislature for
the purpose of investigating' com
plaints as to the cost of gas in Mew
York city, Mr. Hughes conducted the
investigation, wrote, the report of the i
committee and prepared bills which
lowered the price ef gas and provided
remedies for number of minor grie
vances, all of these bills were passed
and became laws of the State. An
oUier committee ' was appointed by
the New York Legislature to investi
gate the management of the great
Life Insurance Companies and Mr.
Hughes who was in Switzerland at the
time was cabled to return to this
country and take charge of this in
vestigation which he did and which
created at nation-wide sensation re
sulting in the correction of many
, corrupt methods and in the compell-
, ing of honesty in the handling of the"
peoples money He refused the
nomination as Republican candidate
for Mayor of New York because, as
he stated he considered' his duty to
the state as investigator of the Life
Insurance Management as of para
mount importance. Mr Hughes was
next called to make inquiry to as
certain whether the United States
should bring action against the An
thracite Railroad for violation of the
Sherman Anti-Trust Law; for this
purpose the United States Depart
merit of Justice appointed him As
" sistant United States Attorney. The
work of preparation for this inquiry
had just begun when Mr. Hughes
was nominated by acclamation as the
Republican candidate for governor of
the State of New York. This nomin
ation was accepted by Mr Hughes:
' "I shall accept the nomination with
out pledge other than to do my duty
according to my conscience. If elect
ed it will be my ambition to give the
State the same efficient and honor
able administration, free from taint
of bossism or of servitude to any pri
. vate interest. A united party making
an appeal to good citizenship must
win." Y .
He was the only Republican elect
ed and it is sufficient to say that he
kept every promise he made in his
pre-election campaign; they were' in
substance as follows:
"I promise an honest administra
tion. , '
No interest, however prominent,
will receive any consideration except
that to Which upon the merits of the
case it may be entitled, when viewed
in the light of the supreme interest
cf the people. "
It will be my aim to make the ad-
ministration of the government effici-
ent and economical
I shall spare no effort to make eff
ective the reforms in the business of
- life insurance so essential to the
interests of the policy holders.
I promise the enforcement, of the
law with equal severity and with
" equal justice to all, rich and poor,
corporations and individuals."
Mr. Hughes was nominated for
President of the United States by the
Republican National Convention and
resigned as Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme .Court, to
which office he was appointed May
2nd, 1910, on June 10th, 1916. His
conception of the presidency as set
forth in his campaign utterances gives
promise of an absolutely equitable and
highly efficient administration.
Mr. Hughes states his conception
of the presidency of the United
States as involving "An executive re
sponsible to the people." The selec
tion of "The Ablest Cabinet the coun
try can supply." The maintenance of
a "firm but courteous policy" in for
eign relations. "Protection of Ameri
cans in all lands." "Preparation, for
trade competition." "Fair supervi
sion of business enterprises." The
securing of "industrial peace." He
believes and will stand for a united
Nation. '
"We Americans are in one boat. You
cannot strike a blow at one group
without injury to all. Common jus
tice and fair play will settle our diffi
culties if suspicion and bitterness are
let alone. These are the principles by
which I propose to be guided."
Such in brief ia the man who may
in the course of events become the
executive head of this Nation. A
man of stound convictions of justice
equity and right, unafraid in carrying
forward those convictions. A man
in whom all classes and conditions of
mar i may place absolute confidence.

i Wilson. President of the United States
of America, do hereby designate the

CIVIC CLUB
Plans ' For Winter's Activities Made
at Meeting Monday Evening Rum
mage Sale Saturday November 18th
Community Christmas Tree. -
-. The Civic Club held their regular
meeting at the Library Assembly
room last Monday evening:
Mrs George B. Hayes the ntw
president presided and plans were
formulated for the activities of the
Club during the forthcoming Winter
season. The Rummage Sale which
proved such a success last year both
m the way of placing unused articles
of clothing- hd furniture and other
household utensils where they were
needed and could be used and at the
same , time helping to furnish funds
with which ; the Club could supply
those in need with some of the necessi
ties of life, is to e repeated this year
and the date set is Saturday Novem
ber 18th. : . All persons having ar
ticles : of clothing or furniture which
they wish to contribute are request
ed to deliver such articles at the City
Hall. where the sale will be held on
Friday November 17th; if such par
ties find it .'impossible to bring or
send them to the place designated
they are asked to telephone Mrs.; F.
H. Wof who is the chairman of the
committee
Too much cannot be said in regard
to the value of such a Rummage Sale
as the ladies of the Civic Club con
duct to' the community.-1 How much
better it is, that an article of cloth
ing or furniture that has fallen in
to disuse, but which is still usable,
should be made available to persons
who have-need pf just such articles,
but cannot afford to purchase new,
rather than clutter up closets, attics
and cellars. , Such articles are not
only returned to usefulness but price
paid however small it may be .is
available to meet the needs of some
one who is in, real want. -
The Rummage Sale becomes a sort
of clearing house, and the Civic Club
is the logical organization : to conduct
such an institution. , " -
The ladies of the Civic Club de
serve the heartiest co-operation of the
community ia mis euieipiise. .
' The Community Christmas Tree
was discussed by the club and it was
decided that the club would work to
gether with the Booster's Club to
assure Wauseon's Second Community
Christmas Tree; this means that we
will have the tree and that it will -be
more of a success than the last one.
Reserved seats for lecture at High
School will be on sale at Fink &

BUSINESS
Unprecedented Volume of Business
soring Prices The Reason Is the
American Workingman's Condition
Really ; Bettered?- A Coming Em
ergency and How To Meet It.
It is worthy of note that the busi
ness of the United States continues
its large vplume in spite of a presi
dential election and steadily increas
ing costs.; Buying for current and
future requirements outstrips facili
ties for production and distribution.
Scarcity of materials and labor con
ditions are impeding the volume of
manufactures. Restriction of -. fuel -supplies
incidental to car shortage
make shipments backward. . but the
trend, of prices in strongly tipward '
and producers have come to the point
wnere promises tor future deliveries .
are given with utmost reluctance, and
an increasing number of prohtable
contracts are beinc rejected- Bank
clearings were 39 per cent, larger last
week than one year ago. While ex
travagant predictions of earnings of v
the Steel Corporation have not been
realized, a new high record has been
established the total earnings for the
third quarter of the year being, $85,
890,000, double the previous highest
point reached in any-quarter Capa
city operations in textile mills, and
footwear factories is the rule and
some manufacturers are refusing con-
tracts lor goods to be delivered next .
Spring, at any price Coal prices are
up and still soaring. Anthracite coal
reached the unexpected figure of $11,
per ton F. O- B. New York harbor
last week and bituminous was selling
at $7.00 per ton. The United King
dom of Great Britian and Ireland has
placed oh sale in the United States
$300,000,000 of secured , loan gold
notes interest at 5 per cent payable
in three and five years in United
States gold coin, so there is an op
portunity for the investment of the,'
surplus cash that has been flowing
into this country. 1 It goes without
saying that the reason for this seem- '
ing business prosperity is the sus
pension of a' large proportion of the
industries and commerce of Europe -due
to the war. (-
It may be an open question as to '
whether the American workingman 1
who in the last analysis is the pro
ducer of the merchandise that is so
much in demand and which is bring
ing the balance of trade this way is
any better off than he would be with
a smaller and assuredly permanent
volume of business. True he has
plenty of work and his wage scale
has increased but he has to pay more
for all that he and his family eat,
drink and wear to say nothing of the
tuel he must buy and the rent he must
pay- And when the end 'comes, as
come it must sooner or later, one is
led to wonder what these same Ameri- .
can "workingmen are going to do and
what their condition will be. The peo- ,
pie who have been making the profits ,
through commerce "-or manufactures
may fall back upon the accumulated
surplus of these profits, the capital
ists and investors who have garnered
in the dividends from 25 per cent to
100. per cent, may fall back on. the .
earnings of their capital but the
Workingman whose sole stock in
trade and, capital is the ability to v
work is not aptfto lay aside very
much for sucbf afi emergency as will
come in this cof ntry with the close
of the European War and consequent
cessation of ' . war orders coupled
with the renewal of industry in the
countries now at war. '
It is something more than political
campaign talk it is a real condition
which this nation must meet and the
problem is, how shall we meet it It
is a problem for the 'American peo-.
pie to graple and solve, citizens and
statesmen, capitalists and labors,
business men professional men,
merchants and farmers all alike are
interested, for in this commonwealth
of ours no class or portion of the peo- ;
pie can suffer without affecting every
class, and every portion "Forewarn
ed is forearmed' and the serious con
sideration of this coming emergency
leading to intelligent preparation for
it is not only good business it may be
the means of averting a national catastrophe.
A BIRTHDAY SURPRISE.
Last Sunday morning while Mr. and
Mrs. R C. Skeels were at Sunday
School about sixty of their friends and
relatives gathered at their home at
233 East Chestnut '.street, in Wau
seon to remind grandpa Skeels that

Sana of Detroit; Mr and Mrs. Ira
Taber and Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Skelley
of Toledo.

kets of good things to eat and Grand
pa and Grandma Skeels were com
pletely, yet pleasantly surprised to
see so many of their friends there and
to find everything in . readiness for

to soon. It is needless to say that
Grandpa Skeels enjoyed every minute
of the time All departed agreeing

FOUND IN FIELD
Last Tuesday afternoon a passerby
noticed a man lying on a shock of
corn in a held on the W. 1. (Jampbell

tic stroke and fell on bis back in the
corn stalks. He was unconscious
when found; Dr F- C. Hartman was
called and had the still unconscious
man removed to his home in Wauseon.
Mr. Gorsuch died Wednesday after
noon never having regained conscious
