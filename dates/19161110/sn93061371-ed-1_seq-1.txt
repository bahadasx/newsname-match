"HE HAS KEPT US OUT OF WAR"
This is the face of a man strong, courageous,
patient and kindly, a man
Always alert to the aspirations of his fellow
man and sympathetic toward their fulfillment;
Never complacent toward the encroachmenljiv
of privilege nor tolerant of social wrong;
Alivaya seeking to enhanc the dignity of
labor and better the state df thd toiler
Never lending an ear to the sophistry of ex
ploitation or the blandishments of expediency;
Always patient to hear and weigh," to ap
praise and analyze, and passionate to find the
way of right;
Never premature in purpose nor prejudiced
in judgment, and never headlong in decision
Smh is WOODROW WILSON.
