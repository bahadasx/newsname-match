WANT TO BE SURE
Result Depends on Few States,
Says Willcox.
Duty to Country to See That
Count Is Exact.
New York, Nov. 10. Chairman
Willcox, of the Republican national
committee today issued the following
statement:
"The result still depends upon the
vote of a few close states.'
'""It must bo bome in mind that the
returns thus far announced are in
most states unofficial and may be
changed by the official count required
by the laws of those states.
"Twice during the unofficial com
putation yesterday in California mis
takes in addition were announced
from that state, substantially chang
ing figures previourly given.
"It is common experience that the
result of the official count almost al
ways varies from the returns first an
nounced. "Where the vote is as close as that
reported In several states it may well
be that material changes will result
from the official count. We owe it
to the country to take all necessary
steps to see that an exact and honest
count of the votes is made.
"When the current seemed to be
running against Mr. Wilson on Wed
nesday, the Democratic managers an
nounced their intention to demand a
recount in every close state.
"All we desire Is to make sure that
the vote be counted as cast."

Wilson Ahead In New Mexico.
Albuquerque, X. M., Nov. 10.
With 533 precincts in New Mexico re

32,155: Hughes 30,405, and it is prac

PRAISE TOPEKA
AND HER PART IN
BIG CONVENTION
Prominent Members of Associ
ation Pay Their Respects. .
This Is Most Successful of All
State Meetings.
COULD HANDLE 2.000 MORE
Capital City Well Prepared for
Large Crowds.
Talent for Contention Was
Best To Be Obtained.
Officers, past officers, and promi
nent members of the Kansas State
Teachers association stated today in
no uncertain terms that the fifty
fourth annual meeting of the Kansas
State Teachers( association is the
most successful event in the history
of the organization. That Topeka
added much to this success because of
the entertainment afforded was the
opinion of these educators.
Following are some of the expres
sions of approval:
From Ed. Hackney.
Ed. T. Hackney, president of the state
board of administration: "The faculties of
our state schools are represented as never
before. They are here and enjoying every
minute of the big meeting. I am greatly
pleased with the program and especially
with the practical nature of the lectures
and discussions. Such a big attendance in
sures greater good than ever before to the
state at large. This convention is the
greatest one influence in Kansas to social
ize and popularize the best there is in
state and national education. The board
of admintstTation is glad to encourage the
state iaculties to attend."
Topeka' Big Job.
Superintendent W. S. Heusner of Salina:
"I am greatly pleased with the meetinir
Snappy programs, good speakers, fine
music, and keen-edged professional enthus
iasm have marked the meeting from first
to last. Kansas teachers have had the op-
gortunity to get into toueb with, the very
est in national education. Topeka has
had a big job on its hands and it has
doDe its job well."
Topeka's Best.
Superintendent L. A. Lowther of Em
poria : "We have had a wonderful meet
ing. Topeka has done its best and the
teachers all appreciate what Topeka teach
ers and citizens have done. President May
berry has given us a great program."
From Dr. Hwiry Wttwr,
rDc Henry . J. Watena.jwesident of the
Kansas State Agricultural colleger "Meet
ings of this character are ertain to in
crease the teaching efficiency of Kansas.
The addresses were practical, and the tal
ent the beat available. Topeka did her
part in making the meeting a success."
From Others.
It. B. Kellogg of Emporia, president of
the association in 1877: "I attended the
first state teachers convention in Atchison
in 1865 when only fifty or sixty were pres
ent. I think the marvelous growth of the
state teachers association is one of the
best indications we have of the growth of
education in Kansas.'
President T. W. Butcher of the Emporia
Normal : "Topeka has given the associa
tion the most royal and generous recep
tion the convention has ever had. The
program was also the best that has been
given."
W. H. Carothers, of the Emporia Nor
mal : "While the convention has been the
most successful in the history of the or
ganization it 1ms certainly made us renlize
the problem of taking care of the members.
I think the people of Topeka deserve much
praise for the manner ia which, the crowd
was handled."
M. E. Mooie of leaven worth, a-member
of the board of directors: "The conven
tion this year undoubtedly was the big
gest the association has had. The man
agement of the crowd was a great improve
ment on old methods. However, the teach
ers are demanding a bigger hall of Topeka
to take care of the crowd as the increasing
Interest in the annual meeting is growing
each year and the problem of a meeting
place is becoming perplexing."
Gigantic Tank.
W. A Brandenburg, president State
Manual Training Normal: "I have never
seen a town give more thoughtful prepara
tion to taking care of an association. It
is a gigantic task to accommodate between
six and eight thousand teachers. I have
been impressed with the high class educa
tional character of the meeting and the
fact it has appealed to the rank and file
of the teachers. In other words the speak
ers have not talked over the heads of the
teachers."
Ir E. Stanley, president of Friends Uni
versity Wichita. Kan. : "It was a strong
program and should hare satisfied all the
teachers. I have missed only three or four
meetings since 7C It is getting to be a
great institution."
E. F. Stanley of Topeka, chairman en
tertainment committee : "The good people
of Topeka responded beyond the demands.
If any teachers did not find suitable quar
ters it was because they did not come
direct to the central registration places.
We easily could have taken care of 2,000
additional teachers."
Prof. A. S. Olin, of University of Kansas,
a former president of the association : "It
has been an excellent program, strong
and well balanced."
Dr. Frank Strong, chancellor of Univer
sity of Kansas: "It was an excellent pro
gram. It grows richer every year."

wicie proportions and many Bourbon
leaders who participated in the cam

celebrities may be the five . Demo
cratic congressmen from the Fourth,

TURNS JHE TRICK
Wilson Wins Without 'Any of
Pivotal States.
Tammany Promises of Delivery
of Big Vote Fails.
New Tork, Nov. 10. Woodrow 'Wil
son apparently has been elected presi
dent without the votes of the hereto
fore supposedly indispensable states
of New York, Indiana and Illinois.
He has seemingly won without aid
from three Democratic leaders whose
domination in th03e states Is popu
larly accredited them in the title of
"boss." They are: Charles F. Mur
phy, of Tammany Hall; Tom Taggart,
of Indiana, and Roger Sullivan, of
Illinois.
Only one other president a Repub
lican has ever been elected without
the vote of New York. He was Ruth
erford B. Hayes, and his election over
Samuel J. Tilden in 1876 is the closest
parallel in American political history
to the close race of 1916.
No Administration Pie for Them.
Politicians all over the country will
await with interest the administra
tion's treatment of the New York
city, Illinois state and Indiana staty
Democratic organizations.
The consensus of opinion today was
that there were lean years ahead for
all three, so far as federal patronage
and recognition by the administration
is concerned. It is generally believed
that on Tammany Hall will fall the
hardest blow since from dawn of
election day the president's friends
had a hunch that the Murphyites
would knife Wilson. The tremendous
city majority which Tammany prom
ised Wilson failed dismally to ma
terialize. 22 LOST IN LAKE

'Calumet, Mich., Nov. 10. In a
blinding snow storm thats wept Lake
Superior last night, the steamer Cas

with a loss of twenty-two members of
her crew of twenty-three. The lone
survivor, a sailor named Edward

New York, Nov. 10. A conference
of G. O. P. chief tlans who gathered
at headquarters shortly before noon
was still in session at 1:30, presum
ably mapping out the states in which
the party intends to institute pro
ceedings for a re-count, or possible
court proceedings. A formal state
ment, issued by them with the appro
val of Governor Hughes, declared the
result of the election could not be con
sidered final until the official count is
completed. They pointed out that
many of the returns so far tabulated
are unofficial and already many mis
takes having important bearing on the
result have been found. They said
they felt they "owed it to the Ameri
can people" to see that an absolutely
accurate and honest count is made.
The leaders expected the official count
to be completed by next Monday.
Those in the conference included
Chairman Willcox: George W. Per
kins; George W. Wickersham; Frank
H. Hitchcock, Travis H. Whitney, Her
bert Parsons, Corneilus H. Bliss, Jr.
New York, Nov. 10. That President
Wilson's election will not be conceded
without a recount in the close states
was the declaration of Republican
leaders arly today after conferences
lasting far into last night. Some def
inite course of action probably will be
decided upon soon. The states in
which it was said recourse to judicial
proceedings was likely were Califor
nia, New Hampshire, New Mexico and
North Dakota.
If recount proceedings are institut
ed, It was believed George W. Wicker
sham, attorney general of the United
States under President Taft would
marshal the legal forces of the Re
publicans. He conferred late yester
day with Mr Hughes and Chairman
Willcox of the national committee at
the nominee's hotel here and another
conference later lasted nearly all
night. No formal statement was forth
coming as to what was contemplated
but Mr. Willcox asserted a recount
would be demanded wherever the
margin -;f Democratic victory was so
small that a comparatively few votes
would turn the scales. He and his
advisers took the postion, they said,
that there should be no "cloud" upon
Mr. W'ilson's title to the presidency.
Until Mr. Wilson's victory was con
ceded the Democrats were preparing
to demand a recount in the so-called
"doubtful states." Alton B. Parker, who
resigned as chief judge of the New
York state court of appeals to be
come the Democratic candidate for
president in 1904, conferred with Na
tional Chairman Vance C. McCormick

BULL MOOSE FELT SNUBBED
State Chairman Aired It and

Johnson Carried State by 300,-

BY PERRY ARNOLD.
New York, Nov. 10. Of scarcely
less interest among politicians today
than discussion of Hughes' apparent
defeat even tho carrying New York,
Indiana and Illinois, was what hap
pened in California. It was agreed
that Hughes must have suffered a
tremendous cutting there, since Gov
ernor Hiram Johnson, senatorial
nominee on the same ticket, and idol
of the Progressives, ran nearly 300,000 i
ahead of him. Apparently the - Pro-I
gressives threw most of their strength
to Wilson.
All of which recalled to Republicans
today the direful predictions which
were made at the time of Governor
Hughes' campaign tour of California,
due to "kidnaping" of the nominee by
a Republican faction which sought to
"freeze out" the Progressives.
Now .hat the election is over, a
summarizing of the principal features
of Governor Hughes tour of Califor
nia by the writer, who accompanied
him on the trip, may serve to throw
light on California's vote.
Johnson Back to G. O. F.
In the first place, they play politics
very seriously in California., Up un
til summer there was bitter warfare
between the "regular" Republicans of
the old school and the Progressives,
mostly recruited from the Republican
fold, but who revolted against the
type of rule which they claimed the G.
O. P. of the states ought to enforce.
Then came the peace of Chicago and
Governor Hiram Johnson, Progres
sive of Progressives, four years ago
Roosevelt's running mate, returned to
Republicanism with most of his fol
lowers. Johnson announced for the
senatorship and started active cam
paigning for Hughes and himself..
Tht first Californian whom Hughes
met on his tour of the Pacific coast
was Chester H. Rowell, a member of
the Republican campaign committee,
former ardent Progressive and former
bitter enemy of the "regulars." Row
ell made a special trip to Oregon to
meet Hughes and inform him that the
"regulars," headed by National Com
mitteeman William H. Crocker and
Former State Chairman Francis V.
Veesling, planned to adopt the' candi
date and guard him from all contact
with their former enemies, the Pro
gressives. Hughes Was Warned of Plot.
Rowell told Hughes Crocker was the
same man who last December, at the
meeting of the Republican committee,
pleaded against compromise with the
Progressives and begged Tor "one
more chance to get Johnson." But
Hughes adhered to his policy of keep
ing hands off state rows. The com
mittee which met his train was com
posed exclusively of "regulars," with
a few picked Progressives Progres
sives whom the real Progressives re
fused to recognize as their kin.
In San Francisco it developed that
no arrangements had been made by
the Crocker-Keesling committee for
Hughes to meet Johnson. Progres
sives said they had been told they were
"not wanted" at the mass meeting
which Hughes addressed.
To add to the mix-up. Hughes was
invited to a luncheon of the Chamber
of Commerce but before the time set
all the waiters joined a strike then on
thruout the city. Union labor was
greatly angered when Hughes attend
ed this luncheon and was served by
"scab" help. The arrangements com

strike and how union labor in the citv

DEMAND RECOUNT OF VOTES
Republican Chairman Wants
Test In Four States.
Even With Doubtful States'
Vote, Hughes Falls Short. ;
BY PERRY ARNOLD.
New York, Nov. 10. America has
chosen Woodrow Wilson president
and Thomas R. Marshall vice pres
ident for four years more, on the face
of returns available early today.
There was only the barest possibility
that recounts and possible court con
tests predicted by unyielding Repub
licans would change the situation and
the Democratic victory is generally
conceded.
California's entire -vote had not
been counted up to late today,
but Wilson's lead was so commanding
that it appeared that no matter what
the result in the few remaining pre
cincts, he would have a clear plural
ity over Hughes. There remained...
however.' the possibility of a division
pf the state's electoral vote of thir
teen. Has Three More Than Majority.
Counting California's entire vote for
Wilson, his total in the electoral col
lege disregarding states in which
there still remained a doubt as to the
outcome appeared today to reach
269 three more than necessary.
Hughes appeared to have gained 243
votes. Three states were still
in doubt Minnesota, New Mexico and
New Hampshire but their total elec
toral vote of nineteen would not be
sufficient to elect Hughes unless the
Republican nominee gained more than
four of California's votes on a split
in that state. Moreover, the vote from
approximately one-half the state of
New Mexico gave Wilson a lead of
more than 6,000. .
Republican headquarters still held
.tay 'i,.?0ut, co"ceding Wilson's
election. National Chairman Willcox
announced determination to press for
S"1,,1." fur ot the doubtful
st.tes California, New Hampshire,
New Mexico and North Dtkota Min
nesota may be added later to this list.
Next Senate Democratic
It was Willcox's contention that
wre aiiici iiau pcopie were entitled to
know beyond question as to their
choice of the national executive an4
that they would not desire to have
a man in the White House on whose
title there was the slightest cloud.
The same incomplete returns which
apparently showed election of national
Democratic ticket, also indicated to
day that President Wilson will have a
safe maloritv in the senate hut an
jeeedingly close one in the house.
There seemed no question but that the
senate would be Democratic by a ma
jority of twelve, but in the house the
margin of Democratic control was so
very narrow thr.t possibly five or
six representatives of minor parties
might hold the balance of power.
Socialist and Irj- All but Fall.
The returns so far indicate election
of one representative of each of the
following parties: Progressive, Pro
hibition, Protection, Socialist and In
dependent. HITS ROCK AND SINKS
