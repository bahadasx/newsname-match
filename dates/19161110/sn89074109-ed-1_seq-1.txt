Returns
San Francisco, Nov. 9.—From
5 834 out of 5,870 precincts in
California Hughes was given
462,538, Wilson 4 ,669. Wilson's
plurality, 3,131.
San Francisco, Nov. 9.—Except
in the event of some exceptional
happening, Wilson lias carried
California, Republican Chairman
Rowell conceded at 8:25 P. M. to
night.
Mr. Rowell conceded the state
after reviewing returns showing
a plurality of 2,970 for Wilson
•with only 48 scattered pricincts
of the state incomplete.
Minnesota, at last reports, re.
ceived this afternoon, would go
to show that Hughes will probab
ly carry the stale. Even with the
thirteen electoral votes that Min
nesota could give it is not thought
that Hughes can win, unless the
official count in other states make
a radical difference in the re
sults already reported.
President May Have Margin of 6
With 272 votes in sight Wilson
has six to spare for a possible
split of electors in California or
a sudden reversal in New Mexico.
At republican national cam
paign headquarters it was admit,
led that, after conferences be
tween George W. AVickersham,
former attorney general of the
United States Everett Colby, of
New Jersey Mr. Hughes, Chair
man W7illcoxand George W. Perk*
ins, of (Baltimore, preparations
Were being made to begin legal
action proceedings for recount in
states where the result was close.
Will Demand Recount in N. Dak-
Chairman Will'cox included
California, New Mexico, North
Dakota, New Hampshire and Min
nesota in his list of states where
recount would undoubtedly be
demanded.

Closest Presidential Election in History
Democratic headquarters were
not behind the republicans in pre

Chairman McCormick conferred
with Alton B. Parker former de

Morgan J. I'Brien, D. Lancey
Nicoll and John B. Stanchfield,
all prominent New York lawyers.
It was evident that if the election
was to be taken into the courts
the legal {fiants of both parties
were being marshalled for such
a battle royal as the United States
never has seen.
