County Teachers' Association
The next meeting of the Noxubee
County Teachers' Association will be
held in the court house, beginning at !
o'clock p m. November the eighteenth
ine rrogram committee have sent in
the following program for this meet
ing:
PROGRAM
Read first four chapters of Kennedy's
Fundamentals in Methods.
1. The Aims of the Recitation.
Paper by Mrs. Josie McLeod.
Discussion led by J. G. Chandler.
2. The Importance of the Assignment.
Paper by Miss Lucy Douglass.
Discussion led by J. I. Dabbs;
The Importance of Clear Picturing
Paper by Miss Genevieve Alams.
Discussion led by A. G. Stubblefield.
Our Most Prevalent Mistake in the
Recitation.
. Paper by Miss Annie Stennis.
Discussion led by J. L. McMillin.
All teachers are asked to come pre
pared to take part in the program.
Kennedy's Fundamentals in Methods
has been selected by the Program com
mittee as the text for use of the
teachers during this year 's work. Let
the teachers come to this next meeting
prepared to leave their order for the
book at the book store; it is an inex
Bpensi ve book costing only 90 cents.
The work of education in the county
as a whole can not re fruitful of re
sults, and the individual school will find
itself unable to do what the present
day school is expected to do for the
community, unless the teachers show
interest enough to unite with other
teachers in the effort to build up the
system. This a teacher can not do by
confining her work to the schoolroom;
some of the things that are very great
ly worth while in modern education, in
community building, can be gotten on
ly by organized and systematic effort.
So then let every teacher plan now to
attend this meeting. Your superin
tendent, your community, and your
county have a right to expect this
much of you.
James G. Chandler,
Superintendent. -
Fdltor of the Br aeon
Our def town, in some respects, is
most peculiar. For fifty yean or more
Macon has about held her own in point
of population, neither growing nor los
ing in number, yet in material progress
she seems to have kept up with the
progress of the world as' we have as
good water and electric light system,
schools, streets and other things that add
to the comfort of its habitants as any
other town in the south or west.
Yet we make little progress either in
population or wealth.
This is unusual, and it seems to the
writer there can be .but one cause for
this a lack of Town Pride, and the
fact that we do not pull together, and
it is a grave fault, for it is a grave
fault, closely akin to disloyalty.
Enter into conversation with citizens
from another town and you hear of its
advantages of all kinds its fine people,
natural advantages, remarkable busi
ness enterprises, etc., etc.
Do Macon people talk that way ? The
writer is afraid not. We spend too
much time thinking and talking "Hard
Times." Did it ever occur to you that
possibly you were partly to blame for
the hard timejthat you are complaining
about by your disloyalty to Macon and
Macon's business enterprises.
While I dislike to say it yet I am
afraid that in this matter the ladies are
even worse than the men. One of the
chief things that goes to make Macon a
town is the mercantile interests. Stran
gers and travelling men tell us that
Macon has more gtod stores and fine
stocks of goods than can be found in
any town of its size in East Mississippi.
It certainly has several good merchants
who show taste and discrimination in j
buying. If there ever was a time when
they ought to be patronized to the full
est it has been for the last three years
I here has been a growing tendency
this year, on the part of the ladies to
make their purchase away from Macon
without giving the home merchant
look and in other instances to make
their purchases elsewhere, then look at
home and find that they could have
bough." tb-s i.im' th'rzs here for the
same :pnce,;and often even less than
they had paid.
The peculiar part of it is that
Borne of thase instance the out-of-town
shoppers were the wives and daughters
of professioeal and business men, and
even teachers in the public school a 1
making a living and being supported
by the taxes and patronage of the mer
chonts of your town.
Every dollar spent st home helps to
build up the town heips to maintain
the schools and chuches, helps to keep
up the streets and to make the town a
better place to live in.
for every dollar you send away vou
only get the article paia ror.
Let s all be Boosters for Macon and

measure, at least, forget the "Hard

Repnttntatlvt Johnston of Coahoma
Stnd$ Saggoitiont to Covtrnor
Clarksville, Miss., Nov. 4 Hon Os
car G. Johnston, representative from
this county, has written a letter to the
governor suggesting special legislation
for the benefit of the farmers of this
section of the state, which has been so
severely affected by weevil Ad short
crops. Those familiar with Mr. John
ston's record in the legislature have
confidence in his ability to draft the
bills mentioned in the letter. When
asked today about the letter Mr,
Johnston gave your correspondent a
copy, stating that he would like to
know whether or not his suggestions
meet with public approval. The letter
in full is as follows:
Gov. Theo. G. Bilbo, Jackson, Miss.
"Dear Sir During the past few
weeks hundreds of white men and wo
men have come from the eastern and
northern counties of this state into
Coahoma and adjoining counties, lured
there in search of employment by re
ports of good crops and high prices
The condition of these people is indeed
pitiable. They have been driven from
their homes by the wolf of poverty.
and know not where to turn. I have
talked with many of these people.
and, from information given me by
them and from that obtained through
letters from friends in the eastern sec
tion of the state, I am lea to believe
that the financial situation in many
counties of our state is most deplora
ble. 'Indeed, I am advised that in one
county which has heretofore produced
annually approximately 18,000 bales of
cotton, the yield this year win not ex
ceed 1,800 bales. Another county has
had its annual yield cut from approxi
mately 35,000 to less than 3,000 bales.
he corn crop in these counties was
about a total loss. If these facta be
true, the struggle this winter bids lair
to be desperate one for the small
will continue for two weeks to go at the
same old prices last year's prices which
are below manufacturers prices to-day.
Those who have not supplied themselves
with these goods are urged to do so at
once in order to take advantae of these
low prices.
.Never in the history of this store has our
stock been so large and so complete, every
department being filled to its utmost.
Our store will not disappoint you, not
only are price inducements unusually at
tractiue, color ranges complete, but the
qualities are thoroughly dependable.
GIVE US A CALL!
W0
farmer, who has, in all probability,
been compelled to mortgage his proper
ty in order, to obtain the necessaries of
life. In an effort to conceive some
scheme by which these people may be
helped, it has occurred to me that
much relief would be afforded if provi
sion should be made for the suspension
of collection of taxes on land for a
period of one year. After a careful
investigation I am convinced that this
would be feasible, that it can be done
in a way that would greatly benefit
the small land owner, and at the same
time would not be taken advantage of
in the more prosperous sections of the
state, nor by the holders of large
tracts of land, nor by those corpora-J
Hons owning timber lands. I further
believe that this can be done withont
material injury to the financial condi
tion of the state or of the counties.
'It has further occurred to me that
it would be advisable to make some
provision for the distribution of cotton
seed and seed corn grown the past
year on the state farms for seed pur
poses, at the actual cost of production,
and that this would be of great benefit
to the farmers in those sections of the
state above referred to.
'If anything along the lines men
tioned is to be done it must be done at
once, and will require an extraordinary
session of the legislature, which, in my
udgment, need only continue three ( r
four days and which could be held at a
nomina' cost.
"If you think well of these sugges
tions I shall be glad to submit for your
consideration the draft of bills by
which I believe the above suggestions
can be enacted Into law.
"Trusting tLat you will give thece
uggestions serious consideration and
accept them in the spirit in which they
are made, I am, yours truly,
"O. G. JOHN8TOX (of Coahoma."

The American wheat harvest
is the smallest in a dozen years
baMv more than 600.000,000
bushels. In 1915 the crop was
1,011.505,000 bushels. The
Canadian wheat crop is hi? i
much below that of a year asri
The government estimates th
corn crop in the United States
2,717,000,000 bushels, wh -h
compares with a crop of 3,05.
000,000 bushels last year. In
view of these smalle- crops, of
the grow-in? honn1 demand and of
the ?reat increase in exports, it
is not hard to see why iome ot
our food prices are higher.
