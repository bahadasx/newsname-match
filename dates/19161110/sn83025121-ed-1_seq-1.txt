House Split md Senate Majority Cut Down For Bourbon Leaders;
Both Parties Prepared To Wage Fierce Legal Battle In Many of

Fight Into -the Courts For Final Decision In Great Contest
CALIFORNIA'S BALLOTS DECISIVE
(Associated Press by Federal Wireless.)
NEW YORK, November 10 President Wilson has been reelected ,f of his sec
ond term as President of the United States on the face of the returns.
At the same time, with several of the States so close in their votes that a re
count may upset enough of the announced totals to elect Mr. Hughes, the nation is
facing one of the greatest legal battles in its history. Both sides are preparing for
this and the names of the attorneys being engaged are those of men preeminent
in their profession.
CALIFORNIA DECIDED ISSUE
The reelection of President Wilson was conceded last night when the, majority
for the Democratic nominee was increased by the late count in New Mexico .and
when the last hundred precincts in California had been reached and it was 'certain,
that the returns to come would not eliminate the Wpapn , majority, vtom i of he
latest California precincts counted, as a milteV 'of fact, added iS the Democrat lead.'
Late"6 sY nTCtVonly 'stxty-fivrpcllftts'Tn -tTis "SjAtr td UP-1tft1tmt
Wilson was leading in California by 2909.
r Announcement to president
At a quarter to tan last night the returns in the office of the Associated Press
showed that the big fight was over and thit the President had been returned for an
other term. A "flash" was immediately sent out throughout the country. This
message was delivered to Secretary Tumulty, at Ashbury I'ark, who
greeted it ttith a shout of relief.
lie hastened to get in touch by wireless with the President who is
on the yacht Mayflower, en route to Willianistown, Massachusetts, where
he is to be present today at the christening of his granddaughter. Mr.
Tumulty communicated the news to his chief, but received no message
in reply for publication.
NO COMMENT AS YET
Neither Mr. Hughes nor Chairman Wilcox of the Republican na
tional campaign committee, when seen last night,-would make any com
ments for publication, each stating that he preferred to wait for the
complete figures before acknowledging defeat.
In the doubtful States the last returns received early this morning
show the following :
NEW MEXICO FOR WILSON
N'rw Mexico has probably given its vole to the President. Wilson
took the lead in the final counting. When 480 of the 6.W precincts had
reported in the vote stood .M.SS5 for Wilson aiwl 29,251 for Hughes.
These returns are from all but one of the twenty-six counties of the
State. Returns from forty-seven of the Socorro County precincts have
been locked up in the ballot boxes, owing to mistakes on the part of the
election oflicers. The clerk of Roosevelt County, without report inij the
vote, announces that the twenty-seven precincts officially reporting have
given Wilson a majority of 425.
WEST VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN
West Virginia has given Hughes a majority of 3090. with one hundred
and seventy-five precincts out of a total of 1713 yet to be heard from.
The vote at midnight last night, as reported from Charleston, stood:
Hughes. 135,266; Wilson 132,176.
Minnesota's last reported count has increased the Republican majority,
the returns, practically complete, being: Hughes, J76.545; Wilson,
175.511.
APPEAL TO THE COURTS
The Republicans are already preparing to begin legal proceedings in
every State where the Democratic majoritKi are .close, while the Demo
crats are also preparing to demand recounts in the close Republican
States, lest victory be snatched from them.

(Associated Press by Federal Wireless.)
EW YORK, November 10 With the votes of four States still untabulated
(4i
because not yet completed in the count, President Wilson has a clear majority o
three electoral college votes over the number necessary to elect, which the returns .
from New Mexico are expected to increa se to a clear majority of thirteen over, the
highect total now possible for Mr. H ugher
The President has carried the fifteen Southern States and thirteen others, a to
tal of twenty-eight out of the forty eight, with every probability of New Mexico
being added to his column. -
Hughes carried sixteen States, with three more almost certainly for him when
the final counts are in. Of the States thit went Republican and which will prob
ably b? yet added to the Republican column, eleven are Eastern States, six aye
Middle. West States and two are Western.
The counting-is as yet incomplete in M mneta." New Hampshire and West Vir- "
1 4 gin, Jxot! th lead in thes are" ftucb that 4U4!aafe
their electoral college votes to the Hugh;s total. This will give a division Mr th -college
of 272 for Wilson and 250 for Hughes. ' ,' ft ' ;
There is some possibility that California's electoral delegation will be found to
be split wh-n the last voten are counted, but the totals as indicated above will al
low a split of six from the Wilson votes a d still elect him.

LOWER HOUSE IS SPLIT
.
(Aiocltd Prn by rdral Wlr !.)
HEW YOEK, November 10 Prealdeot Wilson will hare a fair working
majority to support htm In the senate of tha Sixty fifth Congress, but a
working majority In the house seemi moat unlikely. While the returns from
all the eongreealotMl districts are incomplete it spears that the house will be
almost evenly divided between the Democrats and the Republicans, with a
handful of semi-Independents holding the balance of power.
Revised returns at midni?bt how that the President will have two bund
red and (Ifteen Democratic supporters In the house, with one independent and
one Socialist who will probably vote with the Democrats on party measures.
Oppostd will be two hundred and eleven straight Republicans, with one
Progressive and one Progressive Protectionist.
There axe three congressional rUttrlcU so evenly divided In the returns
to date that they "cannot be clasalned. but If the finals stand as the vote In
dicates the Democrats will gain one more seat and the Republicans two, leav
ing the house divided Democrats 217, Republicans 216.
There will be one woman In the house, the first woman ever elected to
r no grew. This is Miss Jeanette Ranking, Republican, who has been elected
from Montana,
Tho doubtful. Democratic victory In
the VreHidentlal 'K1'' carried with it a
victory as indecisive in the congres
Hioiial ruc.e leaving I'reaident Wilson
with a scant margin, if any of legisla
tive Kiipport. The Democrat lost one
vote in tho nenate, retaining ttutir
majority while the Republicana picked
two voted. In the total membership
of 4 .'15 in the bouxe, the Democrats are
practically without a working major
ity. With 21S voteH necessary for
power, thrf lout thirteen votes at the
present atand, reducing their vote of
22H to 215 with live ronitreseional seats
Htill underided. The Republicans won
211 neat Jn the hoimc and four are
muttered.
In the sepnte forty nine votes are
necciwary for a majority. Of the i)(i

Thirty-five . avnutorn were elected
Tuesday. Thirty tow terms expired and

number, nineteen Democratic . seuts

The Democrats returned seventeen (ten

Republicans returned eighteen senator
