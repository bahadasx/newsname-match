had not ordered breakfast sent to
hla private dining room at the Hotel
Aator. . When he appeared later he
was smiling and exchanged pleasan
tries in bla old way with personal
and political friends who called.
Hughes, however, plainly ahowed
the effects ot the conflicting emotions
of the past four daya. This and lack
ot sufficient sleep, together with the
most strenuous campaign aver made
by a presidential , candidate, had
slightly drawn hla features and his
step had not the awing ia It that It
bad last July before he started hta
campaign.
Early thla forenoon Hughes hid
sent no message of congratulation
to President Wilson. . Thla was tak
en In some quarters as Indicating
that Chairman Wlllcox,' with on or
fwo others, may delay their usual ex
change until the official count Is com

Mr. and Mrs. Hughe walked the
