Tampering In Month Dakota.
Both parties already have called for
a recount in New Hampshire, where
less than 200 votes seem likely to de
termine the result. Charges of at
tempts to tamper with the ballot boxes
iof North Dakota have 'been made In
several section* of that state.
The republicans contended, it was
said unofficially today, that since theS.
democrats claimed California by a
(margin of only 8,000 out of nearly
,1,000,000 votes oast. It was apparent
slight errors In districts here and there
might change the result. It was con*
tended by the democrats tfca* Mr,
"Rowell, In conceding the state to Mr.
'Wiiaon, made no cKhrges of irregu

title to the presidency.
In three states, however, there wore
proepects of contests over one elector
In each instance. The eligibility of a
democratic elector in Texas has been
questioned because he is said to he an
office holder and the law prohibits a?w
holder of an office from being an elec
tor.
One of the democratic electors dt«4
just before electton day and the partjr
managers attached pasters to the bal
lots substituting another name. The
legality of this procedure has been
questioned.
A somewhat similar case has1 eome
up in West Virginia, where a republt-
ear. slcctor refused-, to TUT. th« re

other*f« name. 1

Both sides conceded that no matter
