SHINGLEWEAVERS VOTE
TO END LOCAL STRIKE
Everett, Wash., Nov. 9, 1916.
The Shingle Weavers' strike, which
has heen on in this city for six months
past, has been called off by vote of
the Shingle Weavers' Union and it is
just that a statement be made to the
public concerning this action and the
motives that prompted it.
This strike was called the first of
last May after efforts to effect a peace
able settlement of the wage contro
versy had failed. The men involved
in this struggle have made many sac
rifices In defense of union principles
and were prepared to continue the
fight indefinitely. The wages asked
by the Everett weavers were paid
without protest in many parts of the
state and are now being paid by many
mills whose manufacturing cost equals
that of Everett plants.
The sudden turn events In this city
have taken, resulting in loss of life
and a tense industrial situation, moved
the Shingle Weavers to take some
steps toward establishing industrial
peace. Without exception the mem
bers of this union have the best in
terests of the city at heart. We
realize that the city is confronted by
the most serious industrial crisis in
its history. No matter where the
blame may lie, the facts remain that
lives have been lost, a bitter state of
public feeling engendered, a condition
created which might easily lead to
further loss of life and property unless
H omobodv forgot their wrongs and
grudges and made some definite move
to end the trouble.
The Shingle Weavers join with all
respectable elements of the city in
sorrow and regret over the tragic oc
currence of Sunday last. We have
had no hand in the agitation of the
Industrial Workers of the World, are
not responsible for their coming to
this city did not invite them here nor
need their assistance. We believe an
absolutely wrong policy has been pur
sued by the authorities and members
of the Commercial Club in dealing
with the situation, but none of us can
change past actions, we can only hope
that better wisdom will prevail in
future in dealing with the industrial
situation.
We realized thai a crisis confronted
this city. Nothing like it had ever
arisen before in Kverett. The city
was receiving a black eye everywhere, '
no matter where the blame lay, and
something had to be done to relieve
an intolerable situation, establish in
dustrial peace on an enduring basis, if j
such a thing were possible.
President Brown of the Shingle «
Weavers' Union and President Marsh
of the State Federation of Labor were
In conference shortly after the oc- '
currenee of Sunday and decided to
seek a conference of representative 1
citizens of Everett in an effort to end 1
the trouble. Representatives of the '
state and federal governments were
called into conference and readily 1
agreed to lend their good offices to- «
ward a settlement. President Marsh 1
got into touch with Everett citizens 1
and as a result a preliminary con- 1
terence was held in the office of Hon. 1
W. W. Black last Monday afternoon. I
The following men attended this con- 1
ference: Wm. Blackman, representa- 1
tive Of the Federal Department of <
Labor; State Labor Commisssioner
Younger, International President J. G. 1
Brown, State Federation of Labor I
President E. P. Marsh, Rev. Flint, !
Congregational minister; Rev. Rodgers, 1
Episcopalian rector; Dr. Marlatt, pas
tor of the First M. E. church; A. A. 1
Brodeck, clothier; Hon. W. W. Black, 1
Uoyd Black, Robert Moody of the 1
First National Bank, E. M. Metzger, «
.latin s BallsW of the Plasterers' Union,
C. \V. Knapp, business agent of the 1
Building Trades Council; E. A. Fran- 1
cois, sixth vice president of the Wash
ington State Federation of Labor.
At this meeting the Sunday tragedy
and the events leading up to It were
thoroughly discussed. The meeting
adjourned without definite action be
ing taken, but with every conferee Im
pressed with the necessity of arriving
at sonic solution of the trouble. Ac
cording to agreement the same men
ne | again Wednesday morning. The
ministers reported that they had been
limil de to bring to the Shingle Weav
eri any concessions from the mill
owners and asked the Shingle Weav
ers in Urn Interests of industrial peace
of the community and in order that a
feeling might be established,
that the strike be called off. It was
represented that rightly or wrongly l
in the public mind the strike of the
I Shingle W r eavers was associated with
the tragedy of Sunday.
A special meeting of the union was
called for Wednesday afternoon, which
was attended by all the members of
the peace conference. The situation
was reviewed from every angle and
an adjourned meeting called to meet
at 8 o'clock. At 8 o'clock the hall was
crowded with Shingle Weavers and
interested citizens. The situation was
again reviewed. It was freely ad
mitted that the Shingle Weavers'
wage contention was entitled to
serious consideration, but it was felt
that until the strike was called off it
would be impossible to harmonize
contending factions.
The Shingle Weavers involved in
this controversy have their homes in
Everett. Many of them are paying
taxes. They are men of family with
their children attending the public
schools. They are as vitally interested
in the welfare of the city as any class
of citizens. They are peaceable and
law abiding. They have made in
credible sacrifices during the progress
of this strike. It was no easy matter
to arrive at the conclusion that in the
interest of the public welfare the
strike should be called off. They did
arrive at that conclusion and in so
doing they arose to the heights of
sacrifice. They had in mind the fact
that their fellow unionists in other
paris of the state might misconstrue
their action. They thought of the long
months of sacrifice and actual suffer
ing they had gone through. But they
were big enough and broad enough to
sink their own fight in the interest of
public good.
The Shingle Weavers earnestly hope
that this action will bring an era of
good feeling, an understanding of the
industrial conflict, an appreciation of
the struggle they have gone through,
that will make for permanent indus
trial peace.

PLEA MADE LABOR'S
CHIEFS WHICH BROUGHT
END TO THE STRIKE
Following is copy of the plea sub
mitted to Messrs. E. P. Marsh and J.
G. Brown:
"Inasmuch as we believe you were
moved by a deep sense of the serious
ness of the situation now existing in
Everett, to have invited us, among
others, into your conferences, and be
lieving any act on the part of any
body of men in the city looking to
ward a peaceful settlement of the dif
ficulties would be a commendation of
incalculable consequence and credit
to them in the eyes of the public, and
committing ourselves to give full pub
licity to such action, and believing
firmly in the honesty and good will of
employers of our city towards labor
in the future and unreservedly recom
mending it to you, and believing that
the avow-ed removing of pickets and
declaring the strike ended would
greatly, if not wholly right the diffi
culties locally, and commend you as
those taking the initiative in this to,
this whole city. We therefore ask in j
view of all this you do so remove
pickets and call off the strike, believ
ing thereby you are not conceding
your cause, but winning victory of
even material value.
"Gentlemen, knowing that the pub
lic has already been appraised of our
conference and feeling that the eyes
of the city will be centered upon vs 1
and you for what we door fail to do,we
feel bound to give our actions in full
to the public through the press. We
declare ourselves wholly impartial, be-j
Moving that neither side is so right
that it dares to be dogmatic nor either
so faulty as not to deserve an honest
consideration, we make our plea in
the interest of labor, of capital—of
life —of home and city.

Bricklayers, Masons
and Plasterers
Are Now Affiliated With the American
Federation of Labor
On the 30th of October a charter
was issued to the Bricklayers, Masons
and Plasterers' International Union of
America.
While the agitation for affiliation
has been conducted for years among
the bricklayers, definite atcion was
taken at their recent convention, held
In Toronto, Canada, when the inter
national executives were empowered
to act.
In the charter application, signed
by President Bowen and Secretary
Dobson, it is stated that there are
912 local unions, with a membership
of 70,000, affiliated with this inter
national.
In a telegram to President Bowen,
of the bricklayers, dated October 12,
President Gompers says:
"The charter for your international
union has been issued today. I wel
come your organization into the fam
ily of trade unions of America under
the banner of the American Federa
tion of Labor."
The A. F. of L. executive supple
mented these fraternal expressions
with a letter in which he said, in part:
"It is gratifying beyond measure
to know that due to the efforts of
many of us continued over a long
period of years that your international
union has finally come into the family
of trade unions under the banner of
the American Federation of Labor. 1
am confident that that action will have
great influence with the few Interna
tional unions still unaffiliated, and
that the day i s near at hand when it
can be truthfully said that every bona
fide international and local trade
union of America will be banded to
gether in the bonds of unity, fraternity
and solidarity in the most beneficent
voluntary association of the workers
existing anywhere in the world, the
American Federation of Labor."
Molders' Strike
After presenting their demands for
an eight-hour day, which were granted
in all the larger shops, Iron Molders'
Local No. 158 was compelled to call
about 25 men on strike in some of the
smaller shops of the city as a result
of the refusal of their proprietors to
accede to the shorter work day. Near
ly 150 members are working, and it
is expected those on strike will be
back at work In the very near future.
Competent mechanics are scarce in
the iron trades, and there is a demand
for men at Anaconda, Mont., and other
eastern points which will be filled
from the ranks of the strikers if their
employers do no act quickly. This
will be a big loss to these employers,
as their men cannot easily be re
placed, even after a settlement of the
strike.
It is usual for the small shop to
grant the demands of the union and
for the larger shops to hold out, but
employers in Seattle have apparently
got things inverted, or what is more
likely, the smaller men have not yet
iiwakened to the fact that the em
ployers' association is down and out.

The Miners' Union
Grows by Leaps
District Secretary Short and Presi
dent Flyzik addressed a rousing mass
meeting of mine workers in the Cum
berland field last Sunday evening. The
meeting was held under the auspices
of the Cumberland Local Union at
Walker's Hall, with Robert Blakeley
presiding. It was the largest meeting
that was ever held at Cumberland in
a number of years. Over 100 new
members were initiated into the
miners' nion.
The Bayne mine was represented by
the largest number of men; that Is
due principally to the fact (hat then
lire a greater number of men em
ployed there. The Navy mine had a
fairly good representation at the
meeting, too, and the Hydes mine
turned out almost to a man.
This practically leaves 100 per cent
organization in the Durham ami Cum
berland field.-Seattle Union Record.
Over the 'phone:
"Is this the office of the 'Daily
Squawk'?" asked the voice.
I "Yes."
"Well then, I want you to put in
my dear husband's death notice:
'Qons to rest" In an appropriate place."
The next morning it read: "Gone to
rest In an appropriate place."

Spirit Rousers
By CHARLES PERRY TAYLOR
Secy. Washington State Federation
of Labor.
Let us believe in our fellow men.
They may not always agree with us.
We might feel sorry if they did,
For we do not believe
Some of the things
We were so cocksure about
A few years ago.
May they never lose
Faith in themselves,
Because if they do, they may-
Lose faith in us,
And that will hurt us more
Than the former,
And it would really hurt them more
Than it would hurt us.
Let us believe in our home.
It would not satisfy some folks,
But it contains jewels
That cannot be purchased
In the markets of the world.
When we enter its secret chambers
And shut out the world and its care,
We are lords.
The motto of our home is service;
Its reward is love.
There is no other spot in all the world
That can fill its place.
Let us believe in our country.
It is a good country, best on earth.
With all its faults.
Let us believe in it Imcause
It is made up of our fellow-men
And ourselves.
We can't go back on them
And be true to our own creed.
If we do not think it
The best country in the world
I! is probably because we
Do not try hard to make it so.
Let us believe in today.
It is all we possess.
The past is of value
Only as it can make life
Fuller and freer.
There is no assurance of tomorrow
Let us, today, believe, have faith.
And do our best.
EVERETT TRADES COUNCIL
OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
Minister Favors
Organized Labor
Pastor at Plymouth Church Declares
Unions Are Force for Good
At this time it is not too late to
print the opinions of an eminent di
vine on latter organizations. Few
churchmen are so outspoken on the
subject.
"I speak as the friend of organized
labor," said the Rev. Albert W.
rainier at Plymouth church, Oakland,
Cal., in his special Labor day sermon.
"Only by collective bargaining can
the workingman secure for hlmqelf
under present conditions anything like
proper treatment or his just share of
the product of his labor. One em
ployee, for example, is helpless against
a railroad corporation, lmt a strong
organization of all employees is not
helpless. If men can combine their
money into a great corporation, other
linen have tlie equal right to combine
into a great labor union. I believe
that labor has sometimes made mis.
takes and been badly led. There are
times when unions make excessive
demands, and then the employers
ought to oppose them. There have
been times when organized labor has
seemed to condone crimes of violence,
whereas tlie wisest labor leaders
know that the cause has everything to
lose and nothing to gain by violence.
"I (lo not believe that labor unions
ought to be abolished or crushed. If
the closed shop is necessary for power
ful and effective unions, then I am for
the closed shop, because strong and
self-respecting unions are necessary
under present conditions. They have
a part to play in educating the work
ing men to greater industrial re
sponsibility and self-control and in
preparing for that true industrail
democracy when those who invest
their labor in an industry shall have
their proper voice in the control of
that industry quite as much as those
who only invest their money.
"Those who would crush the labor
unions are foolishly short-sighted. To
destroy the measurably responsible
labor union is only to drive under
ground a sense of injustice which will
sooner or later break forth in the
most unreasonable and revolutionary
social rebellion. When relatively con
servative common action in labor
unions is denied the ground is pre
pared for the most radical kind of
syndicalism and even anarchy. If you
prefer the 1. W. \Y., just destroy tlie
A. F. of 1.. and the I. W. W. will come
in to take its place"
Having given the views of the rev
erend gentleman on the labor ques
tion, it is only fair to give his views
lon another subject—prohibition, in
(this, too, a large percentage pf the
I membership of organized labor agrees
I with him. He says:
I "Because 1 am a friend of organized
labor 1 appeal for a fair hearing on
the question of liquor and labor. There
is just now a decided movement in
I the ranks of organized labor toward
I prohibition. Some say it Is only in
spite toward the San Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce. It is certainly true
that the liquor men in the Chamber of
Commerce have not proved the friends
of labor that they usually claim to be.
But as a matter of fact the movement
for prohibition has other reasons for
its existence in the ranks of labor.
"What has happened in Oregon and
Washington? The so-called Grape
Protective Association a few weeks
ago issued a statement that prohibi
tion had reduced rentals in Portland
66 to SO per cent, that whole buildings
were empty, business at a standstill
and 40,000 people had left town be
cause of prohitiblon. I repeat their
statement because you may see it and
bo misled by it.
•'lt is simply and absolutely untrue.
I hold in my hand lot tors from the
Chamber of Commerce, prominent
business men, and the Mayor of Fort
land himself indignantly denying the
statements of the crape Protective
Association. The real facts are, these
Portland men say, that rentals have
not decreased, though crime and
disease have: thai bank deposits and
Clearances are much greater; building
permits for June, 191(1. double thos<>
for June, 191 a; automobile business
doubled, while school reports show an
increase of population I have similar
and even more striking evidence from
Seattle and Spokane."

LABOR DOES NOT FAVOR "ONE-MAN"
IDEA OF INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE BOARD
By E. P. Marsh.
After a ten months' investigation of
the State Industrial Commission,
State Auditor C. W. Clausen, ex-officio
chief of the state bureau of inspection,
has rendered a report and made some
concrete recommendations. With
some of them I agree; with others I
do not.
I agree that the board should be a
strictly non-partisan body. The ad
ministration of the workmen's com
pensation act has to do with the very
lives of the workers of this state.
Insofar as the act functions to reduce
the accident toll of industry, it has the
inherent power to save and prolong
life, to stop the wastage of limb, pro
mote tlie health and happiness of the
worker. In its schedule of awards it
stands between penury and want and
the dependents of the workers. No
other branch of our state administra
tion touches so closely the human side
of organized society. That members
of this commission should owe their
appointment lo partisan activity, their
retention upon the board to partisan
activity or influence, is wrong and out
of focus with modern day thought.
No "One-Man" Body
1 do not agree with the recom
mendation that the commission be
made a one-man body. The adminis
trative work of the commission is too
great to be handled by one man, nor
do I believe a one-man commission
would work out in the long run satis
factorily to either employers or em
ployees. The details of administra
tion of this act are multitudinous and
complex, and many varying conditions
and considerations enter into the de
termination of adequate awards. The
employer naturally wants to feel that
his money is being honestly expended;
that he is not being mulcted, either by
extravagance or exorbitant awards.
On the other hand, it is the worker
who is getting crushed and broken,
not the employer, and he in his turn
wants to feel that he is getting every
penny of compensation the law en
titles him to. With both employer and
employee directly represented upon
the commission, each has a feeling
that his particular interest is being
looked after. 1 do not believe that
feeling of confidence, so necessary to
successful operation of the act, could
long exist under the one-man commis
sion idea. At some time or other the
employer or employee, as a class, is
bound to feel that the other fellow is
•getting the edge" in administration,
and that feeling would wreck the
potency of the law.

Collective Agree
ment in Men's
Clothing Industry
Collective agreements in the men's
Clothing industry is the title of Bulle
tin lliS, just issued by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. The study is pre
sented in two parts, l'art [. being con
fined largely to a formal account of
the experience of Hart, Schaffner &
Marx and their 6500 employees in de
veloping a working scheme of peaceful
negotiation which constitutes a com
plete system of mediation and arbitra
tion, through which hundreds of dif
ferences have been settled, while
l'art 11. gives agreements of labor
unions with associations of manu
facturers and individual employers.
Between April %, 1912, and June 1,1
1914, 1401 complaints arising between j
the employees of Hart. Sehaffner & i
Marx and the company were adjusted.)
Of these complaints. 1178. or 84 per
cent, were adjusted through mediation
by deputies; 20ti, or 14.7 per cent, were
referred by the deputies to tlie trade
board, which is the original tribunal,
for arbitration and final adjustment
by it;; 17, or 1,2 per cent, were re
■ ferred for final adjudication to the
board or arbitration or to its chairman.
Under the labor agreements of the
company every sort of grievance has
been remedied without any interrup
tion lo the company's business; every
sort of wage adjustment has been
made, and wide differences of oinion
. have been reconciled. These dif
l ferences of opinion ha\e arisen as re
gards the exercise of the company's
I right to discharge union employees,
and of its right to employ non-union
In Organization
Lies the Hope
of Labor
Another thought occurs to me in con
nection with this one-man board idea.
The harshest criticism of the com
mission, growing out of the Gillies
frauds, was the practice of leaving the
signing of final settlement vouchers
to one commissioner. The strong
point was made that if all three com
missioners had kept up the practice of
examining and signing all final claim
vouchers the frauds could not long
have been perpetrated, because the
discrepancies that escaped the notice
of one commissioner would doubtless
have been discovered by one of his
colleagues. 1 notice among the recom
mendations of Mr. Claussen one that
at least two of tlie commissioners
sign the minutes of each meeting, as
well as all other papers requiring of
ficial action by the commission. The
purpose of this is obvious, to prevent
frauds and discrepancies, Where does
that fit in with the one-man commis
sion idea?
Again, it has been found necessary
ln the past, and it will for many years
to come, for tlie commission to ac
quaint itself at first hand with field
conditions, which necessitates absence
from Olympia. Employers, business
and commercial bodies, working men
themselves, frequently ask that some
member of the commission address
them upon tin- working of this act.
They have responded, and they should
respond. A law as fundamental and
vast as this calls for and deserves
patient, intelligent explanation by the
men who know most about it. Under
the present plan field work by the
commission may be so planned that
two members may always be at
while the third member, not neces-
Olympia to finally pass upon claims,
sarily always the same commissioner,
may answer calls made for field
visitation.
More Concerned for Safety
Labor does not want the funds,
mulcted nor squandered, any more
than does capital. Labor does not
want to beat the employers out of
money that the law says they are not
entitled to. We are concerned far
more in safety than in awards, as a
| fundamental proposition. Neither does
it want miles of restrictions and red
tape thrown around the administration
of law until it becomes an arduous,
long drawn out process to collect from
1 the state the awards justly due. Labor
is perfectly willing, aye, anxious, that
evt ry safeguard be thrown around the
funds, but labor does not want to see
changes in the law which will tend to
weaken it* administration and cause
the workman to become suspicious of
jthe act and its administrators.
workmen: as regards the distribution
of work and the maintenance of its
I roll of permanent employees during
slack seasons; and a multitude of
[small questions of policy. Under these
agreements a due process of law has
been substituted for the arbitrary and
I irresponsible rule of the foreman in
the adjustment of all differences and
with the institution of this due process
of law there has developed among the
workers a feeling of security under
the law in place of a feeling, formerly
prevalent among them, of uncertainty,
of fear, and of absolute helplessness.
The plan has commended itself both
to the company and to the employees
as beneficial and profitable.

in Part 11. of the report prescribe the
