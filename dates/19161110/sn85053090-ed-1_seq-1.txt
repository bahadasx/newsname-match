VOLUME VIII.
EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1916.
NUMBER 45
State Democrats Winners
Governor Stewart has been re-elected by a majority of
about 6,000 votes. A telegram received from the Democratic
headquarters at Helena this noon stated that the entire sttte
democratic ticket was elected, even Miss Rankin having gone
down to defeat. In nearly all of the counties throughout the
state the democrats have elected a majority of their candidates.
Montana is stronger democratic today than ever, the party giv
ing a majority for Wilson by at least 17,000.
County Candidates
All of the democratic county candidates except three were
elected Tuesday and Woodrow Wilson carried the county by
a substantial majority. Chas. Hughes for county assessor head
ed the ticket in the number of votes cast and defeated his op
ponent nearly two to one. Bob Lowry made an excellent run
with a big majority of votes. Berry Morris defeated Judge
Williams by a good vote. Judge Daniel O'Hern carried Fallon
County over Sharpless Walker and also Custer County. The
race between Dousman and Cornish was rather close but the
former is said to have won. We hope to obtain the official
count by next week.
Hot From The Wires.
Latest dispatches over the
democratic Baker line and the
republican Plevna line now give
Hughes the presidency provid
ing Wilson is not already elected.
Wisconsin by going to Hughes
with California and Tennesse on
for Wilson by only 7 votes make
Hughes a favorite providing lie
carries North Dakota and Wyo
ming which have already gone
democratic. Minnesota holds
the "pie card" if New Mexico
has already voted for Wilson,
who with 2 in the lead ought yet
to carry Oregon. New Hamp
shire is close and while the New
York count may be complete and
sure South Dakota went dry and
for Hughes wilh .333 precincts
yet to hear from. Montana wem
for Wilson. Ekalaka decided it.
Utah is claimed by the republi
cans and Wilson carried Nevada.
Te vas, good old Texas went dem
ocratic but Texans in Indiana
voted for Hughes and Michigan
went dry by 40,000. Today's
paners say Milwaukee and St,
Louis both voted for Wilson and
Hughes and the prohibition can
didate defeated by 'steen million
votes. Therefore, Hughes is
elected providing he carries more
votes than Wilson who now has
276 or 10 more than is necessary
and that the telephone line does
not go down before night,
