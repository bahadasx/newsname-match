Small Plurality After All

DEMOCRATS TO KEEP
CONTROL OF SENATE
Hiram Johnson is Counted as
Gain For Republicans, But
He is Expected to be
With No Party.
Intern iti-n il News Service :
WASHINGTON'. Nov. 10 Wash
ington and the nation are due to
witness legislative fireworks in con
gress during the second term of
J'rt-x't Wood row Wilson. On the fute
of the congressional election re
turns the pntvorl-ial "monkey and
parrot" affair, the controversy of the
-Kilkenny cats" and the "Donny
l rook fair" will rale into insignifi
cance as tests of skill and belliger
cik beside the battles of the ap
proaching 6öth congress.
With democratic control of the
senate safely assured, the lower
house will he the tier hattle. ground.
far as the returns now show,
there will likely be no real major
ity in the house, and the democrats
will have but a slim plurality. In
dications are t date that 215 demo
crats and 211 republicans have heen
safely elected, with seats assured to
tne independent, one socialist, one
progressive and one progressive-protectionist.
There are five remaining douhtful
districts, three are normally repub
lican and two normally democratic.
If these states make their usual re
turns the democrats will have 217
and the republicans 214. The demo
crats would be unable to put through
:i single party measure without
minority support.
Ills littU is Ahead.
The first real battle of the new
eongrvs. will eome over the elec
tion of a speaker. If the individual
independents vote with the repub
licans the house will be deadlocked
even before it could get down to
legislative business. The house
itself may he forced to decide upo
the political complexion of its mem
he rs. There will be at least a dozen
districts where contests against
numbers elected on the face of the
returns will be entered and the
house itself will have to pass on
these cases. Control of the house
n the tirst vote on a contest might
shift the entire tomploion of the
house. A few democratic absentees
might easily lose all hope of demo
cratic predominance.
To acid to the new situation in the
new house. Miss de inete Rankin,
republican, of Montana, will appar-
t t! have a seat as th first woman
elected to the national legislative
body, and her conduct will bo
watched with inteiest by the whole
country.
iVmnci-ats Control senate.
In the senate the republicans cut
down the democratic majority of
16 to 12. leaving tl'.e ilcmocrats .".4
and the republicans j members.
Hiram Johnson, militant pr-rres-5le

INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. H.
Sixteen dcnux-ralic attorneys
were di.-patcliod iKst lia-te?

lU-rnard Korhly. the democratic
state chairman, declared, "We

INDIANAPOLIS. Nov. 10. With
the result of the presidential vote
in Indiana Dually settled by a clo.e
vote, on the face of fairly complete.
returns, the democratic leaders
began today to knowingly impart
the tip that thid is a great day
coming for them.
They openly charge that there
were S.ooo more votes cast In In
dianapolis and outlying districts and
Marion county than there are le'al
voters. They also ascribe the un
usual quietness of the election here
to the reports that the police had
orders to "lay off" and let federal
agents gather evidence.
The registration books are in a
muddle with many duplications due
to the fact that manv of the voters
uho-e names were on the books,
registered again. There were 74,SS
votes cast in Marion county for
Honhes and Wilson and GO. t S 1 for
Wilson. Koosevelt and Taft in 1912.
How much of this can he ascribed
to the growth of the city is prob
le matical.
C,rand Jury.
It is known that the federal grand
jury is expected to take up evidepce
gathered by federal agents in tAo
weeks, after it has cleared up other
business. Frank Pailey. special
assistant to the attorney general,
says tne investigation will be non
partisan. He also says there havo
been numerous reports of election
law violations.
Complete returns from country
districts will not be available until
tomorrow. Fairly complete returns
show Hughes will run 6,000 behind
Goodrich, candidate fot governor,
and James I'. Watson and Harry s.
New. candidates for United States
senator. Hughes' plurality is now
approximately 6.000.
Wn.l CX)NTIT HILIT.
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 10. Re
publican leaders in California, wear
ied with patient watchin'- and lack
of sleep, will pet together probably
this afternoon to map out a 'course
of action in the bitter light that
seems certain to come from Pres't
Wilson's victory is accepted.
Returns from precincts were
still missinP at S o'clock this morn
in. f these 2 were in what is
considered as Wilson territory, and
it is practically certain they will in
crease the president's lead of G.ir.l.
The remaining nine precincts are
in what is considered normally
Hushes territory, but they are small
ones, and oven if they voted solidly
for Hughes it would not be sufficient
to materially change the present
democratic pluarality. The figures ,
with ;iö precincts missing are:
Wilson 4,5. 669; Hughes 4 6 2.338.
Democratic State Chairman Cush
ing spoke for his party in this wise:
"We have posted a reward of
S." .000." he said, "for the arrest and
conviction of any one guilty of elec
tion frauds.
Ilae Won Fairly.
"We have California fairly and we
don't intend to be cheated out of
our victory. The presidency of the
United States is at stake, and we
will omit no effort to see that fair
ness an l justice are carried out. Neiiri, at '.,r Kockawav IHm-n s.v.n..
have asked for deputy marshals in
Los Angeles and akland. lut else
where strict precautions also will
be taken. The vaults in Iys Angeles
and Oakland will be guarded until
the ottuial count starts next Mon
day, and we will have authorized
representation before every board of
