SEWARD COUNTY
GOES DEMOCRATIC!
With the Exception or Probate Judge
and a Few Minor Township Offices,
Democrats Carry Every Office in
Seward County for the First Time
in Years. 1 .
"WILSON AND SHOUSE
President, Congressman, State Sen-
a tor and Attorney General Are Giv
en Handsome Majorities. Sweep-
ing Victory fqr the Party of the
Rooster From Wilson to Justice of
the Peace.
Seward county reversed herself
Tuesday aad came under the wire

: hunks of joy to the tribe of Jefferson.
: There were no Democratic candidates
' for the offices of county clerk, county
treasurer, county attorney or com
" missloner from the Second district,
' hence these offices were conceded to
the Renubllcans before the election.
' Sheriff Dobson, Democrat, had no
opposition in th,e Republican party,
and his election wag assured, but out-
side of that and with the loss of the
i probate judge's office, which went
Republican by about 60 votes, the
- Democrats made a clean sweep of the
court house, which is quite a reversal
" of the old time order of things In this
county. President Wilson carried
the county by an overwhelming ma-
Jority and Congressman Shouse was
given a vote of which he should feel
proud. Sam Buckland, a Liberal boy
- running for the office of Attorney
' General, was also given a vote in this
county that shows the loyalty of Sew
rd county to her son. A telegram
from A. A'. Doerr of Lamed this

f hand, carried his county (Pawnee)
Vhr 1.000 majority. Yesterday's
' Hutchinson News, a rank Simmons
I supporter, concedes the re-election
. -of Congressman 8house by a vote of

' "be safe in doubling the figures. The
i election of Shouse and Doerr simply
means that the people of southwest
Kansas want their Interest looked af
ter In congress and the state senate
instead of the interests of the Santa
Fe and the Missouri Pacific railroads
Notwithstanding the eleventh-hour
circulars put out by the Republican
' and Independent candidates for rep
Tesentatlve and superintendent, the
Democratic candidates, A. A. Farmer
: and MIsb Emma Thompson, both
' went into office by handsome majori

IT LOOKS LIKE WILSON
The election returns in tbe Presi
dential contest are the slowest about
coming in since the Cleveland-Blaine
election. Hughes started In strong,
but when the country votes and the
scattering precincts were beard from
it changed things completely. It wilt
be a "hoss-race" regardless of who
wins, but It appears at the time this
Is written that Wilson will nose un

ahead. Anyhow, It Is too close for
comfort and we don't believe either
candidate will want to try It over
very soon.
to be humbugged as well as they did
in th4ayj ot PT Barnum...-. W.
Finley, register of deeds, headed the
ticket for county office, and Charlie
Tucker, for clerk of the district
court, came through in good shape.
Miss Kate Wright, Democratic can
didate for probate Judge, who is still
confined to her bed with an attack
of typhoid fever, made an excellent
race in the city precincts but fell
short In the country. However, she
made a good race as a whole and
should feel good over the vote given
her. Her friends did excellent work
for her around the city booths but
her candidacy was seemingly neg
lected in the country precincts. The
Democrats fared better in this elec
tion than they even hoped in .their
wildest prognostications. It was fig
ured that they would hold the offices
they now have and perhaps gain one
or two more, In which case they
would have been satisfied, but to
think of gaining every office for
which they had a candidate except
one went beyond expectations. But
those elected will make good and
Seward county should remain Demo
cratic for soma time in the fii-
