CALIFORNIA IS SAFE
FOR WILSON AND ITS VOTE RE
ELECTS HIM PRESIDENT
Three States Still In Doubt, Two of
Which He Will Get, Giving
Him 276 Votes.
Louisville, Ky., Friday, Nov. 10,
2:00 P. M.
Special to Interior Journal:
Practically complete returns from
California precincts make no change
in morning figures and there is no
chance to take California from Wil
son, and he is re-elected beyond all
shadow of a doubt.
In Minnesota, Hughes is 755 in the
lead with a few other precincts out
and the vote of the national guards
men who voted on the border to be
counted. It is probable that Hughes
will get Minnesota, but he has no
chance to win even with it.
Wilson is 200 ahead in New Hamp
shire and seems to have it sure. He
also has a very substantial lead in
New Mexico and has its electoral
vote beyond all doubt. Even without
these three states, which are the last
to be in doubt, he wins with 269
electoral votes, three more than are
necessary to elect. With New Mex
ico and New Hampshire which he
seems certain to have his final elec
toral vote will be 276.
Chairman Wilcox, of the Republi
can National Committee, while re
fusing as yet to concede Wilson's
election, issued a statement today
to the effect that the Republican Na
tional Committee will stand by the
result of the official count.
Privately, however, Republican
leaders have given it up, and the
greatest race in a quarter of a cen
tury is over. Wilson has been re
elected.
LOUISVILLE POST.
CINCINNATI ENQUIRER STORY
New York, November 10. Wood
row Wilson has been re-elected Pres
ident of the United States.
He carried California. California
settled the thrilling race that kept
all America enthralled for nearly 60
hours.
If the final outcome is as now indi
cated the final vote in the electoral
college will stand:
President Wilson. 272.
Charles E. Hughes, 259.
'jjHangmg By"aJ tKread'rmdrethaiT
two days, the contest narrowed down
to the 13 votes in the Pacific Coast
state. Shortly before midnight (New
York Time) the republicans of that
state conceded that the state had
gone Democratic. It will be by a close
margin. The final plurality may not
be more than 3,000.
But in a battle of ballots like that
which has held the nation almost
breathless, 3,000 votes are almost
moimtnous.
As the fight closed in its last per
iod, the states of California, Minne
sota, New Mexico and New Hamp
shire were in doubt, with the Presi
dent having the better of it in all ex
cept Minnesota. Each one, with the
exception of New Mexico, normally is
solidly Republican.
California, the home of the most
radical of all the Progressives, show
ed a strong leaning to the President
from the start. The women and the
Progressives had flocked to the Dem
ocratic -standard.
Wednesday it showed a partiality
in the counting for the Republicans.
But the tide turned. It kept running
with a steadiness, which to the Re
publicans was heartbreaking, toward
the President.
The outlying sections in the South
gave shreds of hope to the Hughes
managers but late Thursday night
after hope had all but disappeared,
word came that the missing districts
could not possibly show a majority
for the Republicans.
Republicans who had lingered at
the headquarters in a despairing be
lief that "something might happen"
silently departed. They were convinc
ed that the shadow of defeat which
had been hovered over them for near
ly 48 hours had finally settled on
them.
From the Democratic headquarters
was flashed to 100 cities that the sus
pense was over; that the President
was re-elected and that the time for
formal celebration had arrived.
It was the final curtain for the
most nerve-racking contest for the
presidency within the memory of
most men. It was the closing chapter
in the first two sided battle the grand
old party had lost in 24 years. It was
the West triumphant over the East.
When told that California had giv
en its vote to the President, William
R. Wilcox, Republican National
Chairman, refused to make any com
ment. The news was flashed by wireless
to the President on board the yacht
Mayflower, which is proceeding up
the Hudson River to Rhinecliff.
Mr. Hughes, at the Astor Hotel, re
ceived the news. No word came from
him. He had been hoping against
hope. The Preisdent had felt confi
dent all along.
The fight will have its legal tan
gles.. In conference at Republcan
headquarters come of the leading at
torneys of the city, among them
George W. Wickersham, one time
Attorney-General, decided to begin
proceedings at once for a recount in
the states where the count has been
close. This includes California,
North Dakota, New Mexico, New
Hampshire and Minnesota. The Dem
ocrats had threatened recount pro
ceedings in the event that
their
cause was lost. They had made a
sweeping inclusion of a dozen states.
Watching every move made by
their rivals and listening with eager
ness to every return from the deba
table states, powerful men in the
Democratic party gathered at Dem
ocratic headquarters and announced
that they, too, would take part in
any proceedings for a recanvass of
the vote.
The lines at 1 o'clock this morn
ing had already taken shape for a
battle of legal giants over the elec
tion, and there were strong intima
tions that before the curtain is real
ly and truly rung down upon the sit
uation the battle will have been tak
en to the House of Representatives.
The returns upon which the tide of
battle turned were received shortly
after midnight. They came from Cal
ifornia, and showed that with only
48 districts missing the President's
plurality was 2,970. It had hung
around this figure for several hours,
occasionally rising well above and at
time falling to a figure which gave
new hope to the Republicans. An
unofficial canvass was made of the
situation however, by the California
managers, and word was flashed to
the headquarters here that Califor
nia was lost to the Republicans.
CONGRESS DEMOCRATIC.
The Democrats retain a .working
majority in both Houses of Con
gress, which means that the Wilson
policies will be carried out to the
letter and this great and glorious
nation will continue to go forward
and not backward. The Democratic
majority in Senate will be 10 and
in the House about 7 or 8. These
figures may be slightly changed by
later reports, as most interest is cen
tering in the presidential race, but
Democracy rules in both Congress
and the White House beyond all
doubt.
PROHIBITION WINS
The prohibition issue was voted on
in nine states Tuesday, and early
returns indicate the following re
sults: California Wet
Oregon Dry
Maryland Wet
Michigan Dry

: SOME ELECTION'RESULTS
North Dakota went for Wilson by
1,500.
Idaho went for Wilson by 13,000
majority.
Hughes majority in New Jersey
is 54,000.
West Virginia finally landed in the
Hughes column by a 3,000 majority.
Hughes plurality over Wilson in
Massachusetts is 21,034.
Hughes carried Connecticut by ex
actly 5.472 greatly reduced republi
can majority.
By 614 to 205 Georgetown voted
to issue $100,000 for a water and
lighting system.
Ashtabula. O., voted by 373 ma
jority in favor of permitting boxing
exhibitions.
Olive Hill, Carter county, voted
$10,000 for an electric light and wa
terworks system.
Bv a vote of more than five to
one, the citizens of Ashland voted to
issue $200,000 school improvement
bonds.
Six Democrats and two Republi
cans will make up the Oklahoma Con
gressional delegation, a gain of one
member for the Republicans.
The prohibition amendment aimed
to make Oregon "bone-dry" and pro
hibit all importation of liquor into
that state, carried by 1,500 majority.
The Cincinnati Enquirers predic
tion, as a result of its straw vote that
the result of the election hung in a
delicate balance, was certainly borne
out fully by the result.
The commission plan ot govern
ment was approved in Newport and
the democrats carried Campbell
countv which usually goes republi
can, by 1,500.
In Tennessee Gov. Kye, democrat,
was re-elected by a big majority. K.
D. McKellar, democrat, was elected
to the U. S. Serste over former Gov.
Ben Hoope, rep-iblican.
For the first time in its history
the home of Mormonism elected a
non-Mormon and a democrat as its
governor. Republican U. S. Senator
George Sutherland was also defeat
ed by Judge William H. King, his
democratic opponent and Wilson
carried the state about 15.000.
The defeat of United States Sen
ator Henry F. Lippitt, Republican,
by Peter G. Gerry, Democrat, in the
tirst direct election of a United
States Senator in that state was the
outstanding feature of the vote. Mr.
Gerry's plurality was about 6,800.
Hughes carried the State by 4,700
plurality. Gov. Beeckman, republi
can won by 13.000.
President Wilson carried Maryland
in Tuesdays's election by a pluriality
estimated at 16,510, but Congress
man David J. Lewis, "Father of the
Parcel Post," was defeated in the
contest for the United States Senator-ship
by Dr. Joseph I. France,
whose estimated plurality was 6,367.
.Lewis defeat was contributed large
ly to the openly expressed hostility j
of the Democratic organization in
Baltimore City and to the anti-Prohibitionists
because of his vote in
Congress for a national prohibition
amendment. Prohibition was defeat
ed in seven of the eleven localities
in which the proposition was voted
upon in the State.

Memorial Tablet
For
Rev. Bailey to Be Presented to
Baptist Church Sunday.
A beautiful and unusual service
has been arranged for the Stanford
Baptist church Sunday evening next,
when Dr. Fayette Dunlap of Danville
will present to the church a memorial
tablet in memory of Rev. John Bail
ey, one of the first Baptist ministers
in this section of Kentucky, a great
grandfather of County Judge James
P. Bailey and a relative of Dr. Dun
lap. Dr. Dunlap will make the ad
dress of presentation to the congre
gation and tell the life history of the
grand old pioneer of the cross in this
section in whose honor he is making
the gift to the local church, one of
whose founders, Rev. Bailey was. A
cordial invitation has been extended
to all the members of the Bailey
family and other descendants and
kinspeople of Rev. Bailey to be pre
sent on this occasion. The other con
gregations in town have kindly con
sentcd to dismiss for the ptcasior
Regular services will be held at
the morning hours at the Baptist
church, preaching by the pastor aft
er Sunday school at 9:30.
Minor Cases Tried
Before Court Adjourns Till Monday
Grand Jury Busy.
Circuit court has been busy try
ing a number of minor cases since
reconvening Thursday after election
adjournment.
R. E. Thompson, of Crab Orchard,
was declared not guilty of the charge
of having liquor in his possession for
purpose of sale.
A jury gave M. S. Baughman 1
cent and costs on a charge of having
a fence encroaching on the pike.
Otho Catron, of the East End, was
acquitted on a charge of furnishing
liquor to a minor.
Joe Will Rowe, colored, was dis
franchised and given a $C0 fine and
10 days in jail for carrying a pistol
concealed on his person.
Joe Hayden was fined $75 and
costs on a charge of shooting at
Charley Baughman also colored, dur
ing a fracas in Macksville a few
months ago.
Court adjourned over till Monday
for the trial of the docket, but the
grand jury remained at work and is
understood to be rigidly investigat
ing violations of the law in different
sections of the county.
Wilson carried Montana by 20,000.
Wilson carried the state of Wash
ington, by 10,748.
Friends of Gov. James M. Cox,
Democrat, who defeated Gov. Willis
in Ohio have started a boom for him
for the Democratic nomination for
president in 1820.
Although President Wilson carried
Washington there is a possibility that
Hughes will get one of the seven
electoral votes in the State. A
Stream, a Democratic elector, died
just before election and the name of
E. M. Conner was substituted on
some of the ballots. The substitution
was made so late that the name, of
Stream appeared on the ballots in
many counties. Votes cast for
Stream were invalid and may give
one Republican elector a plurality.
Illinois went for Hughes close to
200,000 and beat Gov. Dunne for re
election by 150,000. They even car
ried Cook county, in which Chicago
is located and took away from the
democratic organization there 1,058
jobs with an annual payroll of $1,
822,730, which will undoubtedly be
considered the worst of all by the
Chicago democrats who have worn
their vests slick against the pie
counter. Too bad, sure.

Little Boy Killed
At Hedgeville When Auto Driven" by
Lancaster Negro Hits Him.
McKee Turpin, 11-year-old son of
C. N. Irvine, who works on the farm
of Hannibal aicB'eath in the Hedge
ville section,, of Boyle, just over the
Lincoln county .line, was struck by
an auto ,' driven" by Irvin Turpin, a
Lancaster negro, . about five o'clock
Wednesday afternoon and instantly
killed. - People who lived near the
scene .of the unfortunate affair say
that Turpin was- driving at proba
bly 50 miles an hpu'r and that he did
not stop., One .report is that the
negro says he realized that he had
struck the boy but was afraid to go?
back for fear he would be roughly
handled ;by the people in that com
munity. The auto is the property of
W. B. Burton, the well-known horse
and "mule dealer of' Garrad, who had
sent'vTurpin ..to Danville, with the
machine to "have it repaired. The
n-l neyrQwas arrested and is in jail
JwitHiaTicater, charged 'with murder.
The little fellow was hurled for
a distance of 50 feet, it is estima
ted, when the machine struck him.
He was playing on the roadside about
dusk and it is said started across the
road in front of the machine just as
it rounded a short curve. The re
mains of the little fellow were tak
en back to his parents' former home
at Highland, this county for inter
ment Thursday. They have the sym
pathy of many friends in their loss.
The negro was alone in the car at the
time that the accident occurred. He
declared that it was entirely acciden
tal in every way and that he was
unable to stop the car when the child
ran suddenly in front of it. The
man claims that he was running on
Iv about 20 miles an hour at the
time.
STOCK LAW ELECTIONS
Elections on the question of per-
.mitting cattle generally to run at
large on the unenclosed lands were
held in two of the four magisterial
districts of Lincoln county. In the
Hustonville district, the voters de
cided not to permit cattle to run
loose on the highways, defeating
those who favored that bv a vote of
459 to 387. In the Stanford magis
terial district, however, the verdict
was the other way and stock will be
permitted to run at large except in
the city of Stanford, where the city
regulations prohibit it. In two of
the Stanford precincts the vote on
this auestion cannot be given today,
for the reason that in the Engine
House precinct the officers of elec
tion overlooked setting forth the re
sult of the stock law election on the
stub book tally sheet and in the
Courthouse precinct the stub book
was locked up in the ballot box by
mistake. In the other two precincts
the result was:
For Law Against
Macksville 62 102

The vote in the Hustonville magis

WONDERFUL GAIN
MADE BY WILSON. IN VOTlS IN
LINCOLN IN 4 YEARS
Received Largest Vote Vote Ever
Given A Presidential Candi
date In This County
The largest vote ever cast in Lin
coln county in a presidential race and
what old politicaibs say is perhaps
the largest cast invany race was poll
ed Tuesday in the presidential, race.
The total vote for Wilson wasf 2,204,
for ..Hughes 1,868, and adding to this
the almost 100 votes' cast for the mi
nor parties, the total vote cast is ov
er 4,100.
The Democratic majority of 336
for Wilson over Hughes is also the
largest ever given a presidential can
didate and is a source of much grati
fication to all friends of the president
here. The republicans also cast an
almost record vote for their candi
date, and polled a total which would
'have beaten most any other candi
date except one so generally popular
as Wilson. Both of the candidates
for congress received a slightly re
duced vote from the highest elector
on each presidential ticket, but Con-i
gressman Helm ran ahead of Wilson
in the majority, receiving 351 more
votes than his republican opponent,
Tom Neat, of Adair county.
The vote given Wilson was a tre
mendous gain over the vote he re
ceived in Lincoln in 1912, at which
time he obtained only a plurality of
less than 50 votes over the combined
Taft'aritl Roosevelt vote. Wilson's
vote in Lincoln in 1912 was 1,863, as
against 1,850 for both Taft and
Roosevelt, giving Wilson a majority
over both then of only 13 votes. Just
.how strongly Wilson has grown upon.
the people here is shown by his 2,204
vote Tuesday compared with 1,863
6f iour years ago, a gain of 341
vqtes, while the republican gain for
Hughes over the combined Taft and
Roosevelt vote of four years ago is
only 18 votes. This can be considered
nothing else than a fair increase in
that party's vote in four years.
The vote in Lincoln county taken
from the stub book in every precinct
except the Courthouse where the of
ficers locked" up the book in the bal
lot box, and in this precinct the. vote
is given as it was verbally reported
by the officers of election election',

have gone to the two major parties.

To the Democrats of Lincoln county )
I am ajcandidate for the office ofY
County Judge of Lincoln county sub- i
ject to the action of the Democratic
party in primary m August, 1917.
In asking you to confer this hon
or upon me, I am not -unmindful of -'
jthe; importance" of . the . office, I seek,
and. fully appreciate the responsibil- . .
ity that attaches to a proper dis-j
charge of the duties of that office.'
Sa"ying nothing about the various. .'du-'
ties,' to be performed by the County
Judge- in the trial of cases that come
before him, - making appointments,
settlements; etc., there ,is one -ues-tion
that overshadows every other
question with which jlhe County
Judge together with the Justices of
the Peace of the county have top deal
with and that is the questippv'of
county. The.people 91 Lincf
ty nave on iwo occasions
vote bonds to create & roa
just how 2.00 miles xi c
400 miles of dirt roads
properly maintained '"by the
limited mode of raising road
is a question that Js fecxing the
thougnt. ot our people.
' Economy in the tise of" Hie road
funds is about the only remedy I can
now suggest: As the law now stands
II believe that. tne state aid is an aD
llsoluta,K drancflu ii Jurqperan d
equicaoie aistriDuuon 01 tne roau
work in our county. We are forced,
under state supervision, to put too
much money in small mileage of
roads in favored sections of the
county to the neglect of all the oth
er roads in the county. This, in my
judgment, is unfair to a great ma
jority of the taxpayers, who contrib
ute their part to the state aid fund
without receiving a commensurate
return for their money. I believe
the next legislature ought to amend
the law so as to require the State aid
money to be paid into the bounty road
funds, so that the county officials can
apply it when it is most needed and
will do the most good for the greatest
number of tax payers of our county.
If elected to the office of County
Judge, I shall attempt to inaugu
rate a system of economy in the
county's expenditures, in the manage
ment of the roads of the county, I
shall attempt to make each dollar of
the people's money buy a dollars
worth of work or material to be used
on the roads.
I Would not, however, insist on
economizing at the expense of the
poor man who contributes his labor
in support of our county roads.
The fiscal court of our county is
now, and probably will for a long
time, be forced to limit the number
of days that hands are to be paid,
and the amount of hauling to be
done on the dirt roads of our county.
I believe that each able bodied
man who furnishes his own tools and
feeds himself should have seventy
five cents per day for each full day's
work on the road for which he is en
titled to pay, and that a man who
furnishes two good horses or mules
and wagons and feeds himself and
team should
receive not less than
$wo t!ollars for ' each fu" dy's,?aul-i
ing done on the county roads. I
hold that all sections of the county
should receive a fair and equitable
share in the matter of i-oad improve
ments and to this end I will, if elect
ed, give all the aid that I can as
County Judge.
I am for a strict enforcement
of the laws of our state, strict econo
my in public expenditures, and the
upbuilding of my county religiously,
morally and financially.
Respectfully, M. F. NORTH
