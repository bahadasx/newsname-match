At 230 this afternoon The

telegram from George J Stone
man Chairman State Central
Democratic Committee
Phoenix Arizona
Nov 10 1916
Graham Guardian
Safford Arizona
On returns so far received we
claim for Hunt approximately
300 Republicans claim for Camp
bell on their returns approxi
mately 75 Figures changing as
returns come in but it looks as if
Hunt will pull through
George J Stoneman
According to the Arizona Re
cord Governor Hunt is leading
by 302 votes in the race for gov
ernor 01 Arizona according to
late returns that came in from
various points in the State this
morning Statements from the
republican central committee at
midnight claimed the election of
Campbell by 300 votes and the
democratic central committee
claimed the election of Hunt by
146 votes The lead of 302 votes
may be reduced somewhat when
returns are received from some
50 precincts yet to be heard from
but it seems likely that a recount
may be necessary before the
actual result of the election can
be determined
i Hereis4he prediction on which
the Hunt lead is based
Hunt Majorities
Apache 62
Cochise 825
Gila 1770
Greenlee 475
Mohave 659
Navajo 130
Yavapai 20
Yuma 425

Campbell Majorities
Coconino 56
Graham 204
Maricopa 3415
Pima 359
Pinal 25
Santa Cruz 5
Total 4064
These figures which were ac
credited to Allen B Jaynes re
publican national committeeman -gave
Hunt a lead of 302 votes
and were believed by the demo
crats to insure the reelection of
the governor
Count on the amendments is
coming in slowly but the figures
at hand indicate that the pro
hibition amendment has been
adopted As to the other meas
ures little is known
The indications are that unless
Campbell is elected no republi
can will hold a State office al
though the count on Judge
Baughn for the Supreme Court
is very close
NOT THE CHAMPIONS
The members of the Gila Aca
demy base ball team which won
the championship of Arizona last
year are much perturbed over
the publication in The Guardian
recently that the Safford High
team had defeated them in a
game of base ball They protest
that the Safford Hi defeated the
Freshie team of the Academy
and not the champion team So
be it boys well let it go at that
and say it was the Freshies
and not the Champion Team of
Arizona

of opinions in connection with
the demurrers in the case of the

the Town of Miami a proceeding
which followed the disincorpora
tion of the Town of Miami a
number of months ago
Many fine legal points were in

ing five demurrers in all The
judge however sustained the
demurrer of J D Kenney to the
effect that in the amended answer

did not plead the total number of
qualified electors so that it could
be determined what a two thirds
number would be for the purpose
of ascertaining the number of
signatures necessary for the peti
tion for disincoporatiom
The case itself was setfor trial
on Wednesday November 22d
