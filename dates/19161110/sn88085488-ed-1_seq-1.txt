[Milk WHITAKER WILL
TALK TO CITIZENS
l ————
.Open Meeting of Chamber of Com*
merce to 11. Held Tuesday Noon
—Fanners ami Their Wives
Invited
1 Mrs. Helen Dow Whitaker, pro-
I feasor of tin- division of poultry at
j ti.c Btate College, will address the
members of th.- chamber of com
merce and their wives, as well as nil
farmers who desire to attend, at the
chamber rooms in the city hall Tues
day noon of next week. Mrs. Whit
aker will deal with the poultry In
dustry in general and will also ex
plain in detail the all-Northwest egg
laying contest, which is now in prog
ress at the college, with 1200 hens
entered. The meeting is the direct 1
result of complaints by local mer
chants that they find it necessary to '
import a largo percentage of the eggs
consumed in Pullman, although they j
would much rather purchase tho eggs
from local poultry men and farmers. 1
An effort will be made to interest
the farmers in the poultry industry
as a side issue, with a view to sup-|
plying the local demand for fresh
eggs.
All members of the chamber are
requested to bring their wives and
all farmers who are interested in the :
subject are also requested to attend
and bring their wives. Dinner will
be served at 25 cents per plate.
NO GRAIN QUOTATIONS
I
None of the local grain buyers
were in the market for wheat yes
terday, although the Chicago ex
change showed a slight increase in
quotations. One dollar and fifty
cents per hundredweight was offered I
for oats, the only cereal sought by 1
the local dealers. Figured on the
basis of the Chicago market wheat 1
would be worth around $1.50 In
Pullman if quotations were available. I
COLFAX AND PULLMAN
i WILL CLASH TODAY
l i
After Five Straight Defeats at Hands '
of Pullman, Colfax Anticipates
Victory—Much Interest In
Game
i
|
Determined to avenge the defeats
of the last five successive years, Col-1
fax will go Into the game against
Pullman high this afternoon at Col-i
fax with one of the beat teams thai ]
ever represented the county seat j
school and a battle royal Is expected. ;
That Colfax confidently expects to
lower the colors of thir humiliators
of the past five seasons is indicated j
by the attitude taken by the Colfax j
Palouser, Which says.
"It appears, however, that this is
the year for Colfax to win if ever the
Pullman winning streak is to be'
broken. Tho team this year has j
surpassed all the hopes of its
support rs by the remarkable of
fensive displayed. To date it has ;
j scored 94 points to 12 for its oppon
ents.
"The 'dope' all points to a Colfax
victory. Colfax was defeated by the
| W. S. C. Preps in the first game of
I the season, 6 to 3. Tho Preps later
i defeated the Pullman high team 20 I
to 0. Tekoa defeated Pullman, 7 to j
6, and Colfax defeated Tokoa, 18 to j
iO. It must be said for the Pullman
team, however, that a number of
; their regulars wero out of the game
on account of low grades, and it Is !
! possible that the visiting team will
'be much stronger Friday than it was j
In the game against Tekoa.
"With the three decisive victories
behind them, the Colfax team has
gained the confidence that adds pow
;er to their drives. Their training,
weight, speed and natural ability,
i combined with the confidence they
have gained In the past three games,
places them the favorite in the me I
Friday. The long-standing rivalry
between tho two schools, however,
gives assurance that neither team
will quit until the final whistle, and
I there should bo thrills in abundance
i during the contest
"The Colfax students are planning
a reception to the Pullman players
and rooters who are expected to come !
down for the game."
The Pullman high school team will I
he composed of practically the same
boys that played last Saturday In
Clarkston, when Clarkston high
school team was beaten SS to 0.
NUMBER 3
WILSON CARRIES .
WHITMAN COUNTY
With Two Precincts Mining, Repub
licans Have Nine County Offices,
; Democrats Five—lister
Given Hig Lead
—___ «•
With two precincts, Maiden and
Evan, still missing, Whitman county
has given Wilson a lead of 787 votel
over Hughes, while Poindexter leads
Turner by less than 500. LaFollette
leads Masterson for congress by 1563
votes and Lister has a 1231 voto edge
over Mcßride.
The republicans secured nine of
the county and legislative offices and
five went to the democrats. On none
of the offices will the two missing
precincts turn tho tide, all the ma
jorities being too great to ho over
come, although slight changes will
bo made in th.> totals. On repre
sentatives in the eighth legislative
district, senator in the ninth district
and county clerk the count Is com
plete, and the figures given are final
so far ns the unofficial count Is con
cerned. In the seventh legislative
district Hoover is leading the field
with Jones second and Goodyear 174
votes behind Jones. Hoover and
Jones are apparently elected. The
contest for senator in the ninth dis
trict was close and exciting, Dr.
Brand, democrat, winning over Sen
ator McCoy, republican, by approxi
mately 200 votes. Telephonic re
turns on sheriff from the two miss
ing precincts reduce McClure's lead
over McLean for sheriff to 224 votes.
