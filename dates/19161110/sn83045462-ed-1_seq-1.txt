Guardsmen Kay Control State.
The result in Minnesota may be determined
by the ballots of the 2,138
national guardsmen now on the Mexican
border, which will not be counted
* until the state canvassing board meets
next Tuesday. Returns received early
' oday in the state gave liueUe#
f slightly ovbr 1,000 votes.
With ninety-nine districts missing
jut of 638 in New Mexico, Wilson wis
',> 10 ahead. The remote precincts not
. et heard from are sparsely settled,
:d ft was not believed the President's
.cad could be wiped out.
The outcome in New Hampshire was
in greater doubt than in any other
:?tate. Certified returns from all
hut twenty-five precincts gave Hughes
lead of 131, but unofficial figures
"rom the districts lacking were said
*o show a Wilson plurality of 117.
California, complete. except for
thirty-six of the 5,870 precincts in the
-tate, gave Wilson 465,663 and Hughes
'tlL'.G3S, a plurality of 3,131 for the
resident.
The tension of the most dramatic j
ination in the political history of the <
1 ited .States was broken when the (
V:-ociated Press flashed the news that i
.l_*publlcan State Chairman Rowel 1 of j
'a'ifornia had conceded the state to j
Vilson. Frantic appeals t?? expedite
etums had been sent to state leaders j
our after hour from the national j
leudquarters or Doin parueo m ,
city. Telegrams were reinforced by j
elephone calls across the continent.
It had been apparent since Wednesday
hat California was the pivot upon
hich the election would swing.
Stage Coaches Bring Returns.
It was not until stage coaches had
come through from communities tucked
away into the Sierras or settle- j
luents on the ari." eastern slope* of the (
ountains that the result was known, j
Ordinarily the few votes cast in the |

by telephone or tec g upb und the trails
and ti: passes leading to them were j
choked with enow m many places, j
There was nothing to do but wait for j
the stages, and they began coming in !
last night.
Similar difficulties were enemmte-ed '
\n collecting the returns from the tv;l4g !

That President Wilson s election will |

publican leaders early today after conferences
lasting far into hist night. Some

Wickersham to Head Counsel.
If recount proceedings are instituted it
was believed George \V. Wickersham, Attorney
General of the United States under
1'resident Taft, would marshal the
legal fores of the republicans. 11c conferred
late yesterday wiili Mr. Hughes 1
and Ghairm&n William R. Willcox of the |
national committee at the nominee s ho-tel
here. No formal statement was forthcoming
as to what was contemplated, but
-Mr Willcox s??ju>rteH :? recount would be
demanded wherever the margin of democratic
victory was so small ?hat a comparatively
few votes would turn the
scales. lie and ids advisers took the
position, they said, that there should be
no -cloud" upon Mr. Wilson'6 title to the
presidency.
Until President Wilson's victory was
assured the democrats also were preparing
to demand a recount in the so- ;
called "doubtful" states. Alton B .
Parker, who resigned as chief judge of
the New York state court of appeals to
become the democratic candidate for
President in 19?)4, conferred with Na?.

Brrprs *n Count Only Hope.
The republicans contended, it was
said, unoflieiafiy today that since the
democrats claimed California by a margin
of only approximately a,000 out of
nearly 1,000,<?00 cast it was apparent
slight errors in a district here and
there might Ohange the butcome.
The democrats maintained on the
other hand that no charges of fraud
had been made by estate Chairman
Rowell of the republicans in conceding
the state to Mr. Wilson, and that if
there had been any basis for them he
undoubtedly would so have informed
tlic national headquarters of the party
in this city. In a statement made to
the .Associated Press at San Francisco
the only contention Mr. Howell made
of even of a partial victory for Mr.
Hughes was that the electoral vote
of that state might be split ori the official
count, as it was in 1912, when two
votes went to Wilson and eleven to
Roosevelt.
Both ?ides conceded that no matter
That action might be taken in regard
to a recount, there was little likelihood
of a. contest being carried to the House
of ji^Pfaentatives, as it was after the
Hayes-T'iden campaign in 1876. Legislation
enacted in 1887, it was said,
made the states sovereign in pronouncing
judgment in a recount of the presidential
vote.
In three states, however, there were
prospects of contests over one elector
in each instance. The eligibility of a
democratic elector in Texas has been
questioned, because he Is said to be an
officeholder, and the federal laws prohibit
a perpon holding office from serving
as an elector.
One of the democratic electors In
Washington died just before election
day. and th^ party managers attached
pasters to the ballots substituting an
other name for his. The legality of
this procedure lias been questioned by
th* rep^blk-.-ms. A somewhat similar
case has arisen in West Virginia, where
one of th'- republican electors refused
to run and the republicans resorted to
pasters bearing another name in place
of his.
News Broken to Hug-hes.
T'p to the time republican headquarters
here closed soon after midnight
the party leaders gathered there refused
to concede defeat. They eeemcd
t?> base their confidence upon the assumption
that,"something might happen"
ir California. Mr. Huglus was
told before he retired for the night that
California had gone against him, but he
liad no comment to make.
Democratic headquarters were electrified
by the announcement of the result
in California transmitted to Chairman
McCormick by the Associated
Vrr*h. The chairman was especially
gratified because he had been vindicated
In his pre-election prediction that
Wilson could be elected even If he lost
X? w York, New Jersey, Indiana and
Illinois.
Mr. Wilson's victory was believed by
politicians to presage an alignment for
the first time in Congress of the west
With the south. it was pointed out
that while he would not have "a working
majority" in the lower house he
would not have to combat a majority
mimical to his policies.
There was touch speculation today
among suffragists as to the part played
by women in th?- election. Analysis of
their vote was eagerly awaited. While
President Wilson lost in Illinois and
Oregon he carried Washington, Idaho.
Montana, Wyoming. Utah. Colorado,

PARTIES IN HOUSE
ARE NEARLY EVEN
Indications Today Are That
the Democrats Will Have
Only Three Plurality.
WOMAN CLAIMS ELECTION*
? I
An almoafc even division in the House
of Representatives for the Sixty-fifth
Congress Is assured, with democrats retaining
control by at least three, votes,
is the indication late today. The result
in five districts is so close as to keep
thexn still doubtful, but without these
returns 215 democrats have been elected,
211 republicans, 2 progressives, 1 |
! socialist and 1 independent. In New /
j Mexico, Representative Hernandez, re- <
| ptiblican, ia so close to his democratic
i opponent, W. B. Walton, as to make the :
result doubtful. In WeSt Virginia the j
j second, fifth and sixth districts are J
: still to be counted, with the votes so!
I ?'lnsp na *r\ maV/. a nrPflirtion rash. In i
Wyoming, Representative Mondell, re- ;
I publican incumbent, is being so hard '
pushed by the democratic candidate, ,
John D. Clark, as to make that result j
I doubtful. \
Becounts in Two District*.
Although announcement was made j
I that Representative Britt. republican, \
had been re-elected from North Carolina, j
later developments make a recount j
necessary. He claims a plurality of five,
while the democrats claim a plurality o?
two. A close condition exiets in the third ,
Louisiana district, where W. P. Martin, j
"progressive-protectionist," is supposed
, to have been elected over his democratic
j opponent.
Assuming that the North Carolina and
Louisiana results stand, in the five i
I missing districts two are normally
democratic and three republican. Their
adherence to usual political form will
mean that the. House would have 217
democrats andfel4 republicans, a democratic
plurality of three. However, the
four scattering votes in the other
minorities have generally been cast
with the democrats. i
Effect of the Close Vote.
The close vote Io the Row means _
that both parties will be more watch- i "
ful of each other than they, have been . I
for two sessions past. It will probably ! j
mean a closer attention to business J L
and less absenteeism than heretofore. ;
If the New York democrats show the
independence they have shown for two
years past, it will mean republican victories
in close votes from time to time.
The defeat of Representative Cullop
and Representative Gray, d.mocrats, in \
Indiana, removes two militant members
of the majority from the House. Repvnuonto*iiro
Ptillnn hntppvtr has a hahlt i
of going down to defeat on election
day, only to arise triumphant again I
after an official recount. It may tran- j
spire that, he has been elected after all. j

They are veteran legislators. Rep- j

up was the defeat of Representative ^

SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.. November 10.? j
With California's determining presidential j
vote conceded to Wilson, interest in the j
size of the President's plurality claimed !
attention today for its bearing in the case
of a split electoral delegation which hasi
been predicted. J
I only thirty-tour precincts remameu iu j
be heard from today, when Wilson's lead i
j was 3,160. As the missing precincts are j
in sparsely settled counties it was be- ^
lieved that the present plurality would j
not be changed materially.
Both Secretary of State Jordan and
Chester H. Rowell, chairman of the re- !
publican state central committee, who
early last night, conceded the state to
Wilson, look for a split delegation, as
happened four years ago. An official
count under the supervision of Jordan
probably will be begun next Tuesday.
Johnson Has Big Plurality.
Gov. Hiram W. Johnson (republicanprogressive)
has been elected to the j
1 United States Senate by a large plural- j

I A review of the results in the far west- i
j ern states shows that, besides California,
i Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada. ;
j Utah, Wyoming, Arizona and Colorado (
; voted for Wilson and Oregon for Hughes. !

of Montana lor Congress. She had a j

s He arose about S o'clock, and, after |
. reading the newspapers, went for an I
automobile ride. He was apparently
in cnecrfu! spirits.
It was expected at his hotel that he
( would receive a visit during the day
y from Republican National Chairman
r Willcox and one or two other party
e leaders, probably after the conference
s at republican headquarters, set for the
i noon hour, on the question of a recount
_ of the vote in close states.
This matter, it wuis understood. Mr.
Hughes was leaving entirely in the .
hands of his campaign managers, although
before taking definite action it
was expected they would consult him
to jearn his views.
No Statement for Publication.
r Mr. Hughes spent another long day
r studying the final western election returns
yesterday. The nominee and his !
I wife remained indoors, except for a I
j two-hour motor ride in the afternoon,
3 but derided to relax the vigilance of
a their watch last night and went to a
" theater. lie retired soon after scanning
1 the midnight figures. Though in private
conversation with friends he was
p still confident of carrying California.
Minnesota and West Virginia he de2
clined to make any statement for publi5
cation.
a Word that California had been car- ,
ried by Wilson on the face of nearly
complete unofficial returns was carried
" to Mr. Hughes shortly before he rer
tired last night. He declined to cdmr
ment on the situation.

HOLDS A CONFERENCE
WITH G. 0. P. LEADERS
Issues Formal Statement After Meeting
Showing Confidence of Finding
Mistake in California.

NEW York, November 10.?
Chairman \\ ilicox, refusing to
concede the election of President
Wilson, said today in a formal
statement issued after a conference
with other republican cam??:

still depends upon the vote of a
few close states, and that the returns
thus far announced are in
most states unofficial and may be
changed by the official count.
Recount May Be Necessary.
"The result still depends upon th?
votes of a few close states." Mr. Willcox's
statement read. "It must be
borne in mind that the returns thus far
announced are in most states unofficial
and may be changed by the official
count required by the laws of those
states. Twice during:; the unofficial
computation yesterday in California
mistakes in additions were announced
from that state, substantially changing
figures previously given. It is common
experience that the result of the official
count almost always varies from
lh*?-rGturns first announced.
"Whtti>* Uu> vote is as close as that
reported in several states it may wel^
be that material changes w II resu!t
from the official count. We owe it to
the country to take all necessary steps
to see that an exact and honest cjunt
of the votes is made. When the current
seemed to be running against Mi.
Wilson on Wednesday the democratic
managers announced their In entlon to
demand a recount in every close state.
All we desire is to make surj that the
vote be counted as cast."
To Abide by Official Count.
Mr. Willcox added verbally that it
was "superhuman!y impossible, for the
preliminary count to conform exactly
with the official count."
"Among those who assisted Mr. Willrox
in preparing tlic statement, or to,
whom it was submitted before being
idvon out. were National < unmitteemen
Charles B. Warren of Michigan and
Herbert Parsons of New York, Everett
Colby of New Jersey and George W.
Perkins of New York, member* of th?*
campaign committee; Cornelius N.
Bliss, jr., treasurer of the republican
national committee, and George W,
Wickersham, former United States Attorney
General.
Mr. Wiilcox further stated that unless
special circumstances arose the
national committee would abide by tho
decision of the official count. In case
ballot box irregularities were brought
to the committee's attention appropriate
action would, of course, be taken,
he said. Mr. Willcox's statement, ic
was learned, was also submitted to
Charles E. Hughes before it was given
out.
Contests Over the Election
Concern the States Solely,
and Not Federal Government
The possibility or legal p^oceedlngi
over the votes for presidential electors
in close states led to a discussion hero
today of the laws and decisions of the
courts governing such contests. Examination
of the Revised Statutes and the
clecision of the Supreme Court, of the
L'nited States plainly showed that electors
are regarded as state officers Questions
of their proper or improper choice
jlV3 for determination by state election
officers or the state courts, the Supremo
Court has held in two leading case*,
rhe federal government is not lawfully
concerned even if' fraud is shown, it
was said.
The Revised Statutes provide that the
electors shall meet in each state and
give their votes" on the second Moniay
in January following election, at
places to be designated by the statu
legislatures. In the ordinary course of
proceedings where the right of the
electors to sit is uncontested their
t'otes would be counted in the House of
Representatives hero on the second
Wednesday in February, and this
would be the legal end to the election.
State Laws Are Binding.
The statutes further provide that
where a state shall have laws made
jrior to the election determining methkIs
by which controversies or contest*
>ver electors shall be settled, whether
jy judicial proceedings or otherwise,
hese laws "shall be binding and shall
jovern in counting the electoral vote."
Officials hero were under the Impression
that it would be found that all the
suites mat may be involved in conests
have laws of this character.
Aside from the direction that the
electoral votes of all the states bo
;ounted in the House on the second
donday in January, there seems to be
lothing /to indicate just liow much lattude
a state might have in determinng
contests so as to have its vol?
counted at the fixed time. The stat
lieb J?rO?lUC LllilL III'; oi tne
tates be forwarded to Washington
forthwith" after the electors meet on
he second Monday in January, and
dso say that whenever the certificate
?f any state as to its electors has not
>een received in Washington on the
ourth Monday in January a special
nesaenger shall be sent to the district
