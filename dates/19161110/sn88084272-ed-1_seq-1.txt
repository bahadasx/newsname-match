The speaker said that formerly Ger

than France and England to the idea
of arbitration. The chancelor had ex
pressed fear that Lngland would frame
a peace coalition in accordance with
her own desires. Nevertheless, the
principle ought to be recognized as

The conference today brought the
admission from the representatives of
both governments that Carranza now
is conducting a defensive fight against
Villa instead of prosecuting a cam
paign against him.
Reports from official sources In pos
session of the American representa
tives were compared with those re
ceived by the Mexicans with the result
that the stories of the capture by Villa
of Santa Rosalia, Jimenez and Iarral
were regarded as confirmed.
Information placed before the com
mission by the Americans indicated
that another battle between Mexican
government forces and Villa forces is
imminent at Kscalon, on the railway
south of Jimenez.

from Chihuahua City. United States

The popular vote will go to Wilson
by something like 16.006 plurality. The
final distribution of votes probably
will be at the rate of 36,660 for Wilson
and 28.000 for Hughes. There will be

Three State In Doubt.
Minnesota, Xew Mexico and Xew

sota's latest returns showed Hughes
leading by 487 but the figures for Xew
Hampshire put Wilson ahead by 239,
with 11 precincts missing while he also
led in Xew Mexico.

private business, he said today. Work
men were removing the furniture and
the committee's local business, it was
stated, would be conducted at a branch
office. The main headquarters will be
in Washington.
Hnehra Zvot Ready to Congratulate.
Mr. Hughes himself declined to make
any comment upon the election results.
He rose about S oclock and afteV read
ing the newspapers went for an auto
mobile ride. He was apparently In
cheerful spirits.
Lawrence Green, secretary to Charles
E. Hughes, said today in response to
questions by newspaper men. that Mr
Hughes would not today send con
gratulations to president Wilson. "Xot
yet" said Mr. Green.
Geo W. Perkins was the first to ar
rive at the headquarters of the Repub
lican national committee. He was fol
lowed by John W. Weeks, chairman of
the Republican senatorial campaign
committee, and the two had a prelim
inary conference
Seems safe for Wilson.
When California went Into the Wil
son column last night it was conceded
though not by the Republican cam
paign managers that the president
had. been elected, as this gave him 269
votes, or three more than enough to
elect him. without Xew Hampshire,
which the returns indicate is eafelv in
the Wilson column. With Xew Hamp
shire the president has 273 votes, with
the possibilitv of eettins- th tha Ca

May Demand Recount
That president Wilson's election will
not be conceded without a recount In
the close states was the declaration of
Republican leaders early today after
conferences lasting far into last night
Some definite course of action prob
ably will be decided upon within a
few hours. The states in which It was
said recourse to Judicial proceedings
was likely were California. New Hamp
shire. Xew Mexico and North Dakota.
Ilsnn to Carry New Mexico.
Unless there is decided overturn In
the districts missing. Wilson will carry
New Mexico. Hughes is leading In
Minnesota. The result will not be
known in Xew Hampshire until the
official count is completed. West Vir
ginia, which was classed as doubtful
until last night has gone definitely
for Hughes.
The president could lose three votes
from California and still have enough
to elect This loss would be offset by
New Mexico, which it seems certain he
has carried.
If Mr. Hughes carried both Minnesota
with 12 votes, and Xew Hampshire,
with four, he would have only 259. sev
en less than enough to elect
Minn. Guardsmen May Decide.
The result in Minnesota may be de
