OHIO GOES DEMOCRATIC

to Hold Majority in the
House.
New York.--In one of the closest
presidenitial elections that has been
held in the United States in years.
Woodrow Wilson has a strong lead
over ('has. E. Hughes, with a number
of doubtful states which are leing
claimed by the chairmen of both par
ties.
The early returns indicea' el a trend
toward the Republican (cnldidate. but
these came chiefly from thlie Northern
and Elastern states, which were gen
erally conceded to II ughis. As the
return began to dlrift in. however,

WOODROW WILSON.
ntats.,, the Democratic Strongholds,
the leads began to Change, and doubt
ful states began to swing into the
Democratic column. The larger num
ber of Wilson states overcame! the
advantages gained by HIughes and
P(airbanks in New York, Pennsylva
nla, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts and
Michigan with their heavy electoral
vote. The South remained solidly
Democratic by increased majorities,
and the North was invaded for Ohio's
24 electoral votes for the Wilson-Mar
shall ticket.
National Chairman Vance McCor
mick early issued statements, in the
face of posittre dec~larations of vie
tory by the Republican chairman, de
claring: that the Democratic ticket had
won, and urging the party leaders to
"sit tight." "Preeldent Wilson has
been re-elected," said he. "Our oppo.
nents are desperate. Let us person
'lly see that the ballot boxes are
gearded and nothing left undone to
eateguard the victory.
The followPlag statse were claimed
as certainly for Wilson: Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louilsana, Mary
land, Mississippi, Missourt, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vir.
ginia and -Wyomint-235.
Thre followring were claimed as
Hlughles certaintles: Connacticat, Del
aware, Illinota, Iowa, Maine, Mdassa
chusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Dakota, Vermont and 'Wiscon
sin--215.
The ifolloing states, where the vote
is very close, lnasome lastsacesl so
elose that it may requilre the ofmeial
count to determilne the result, were
placed in the dourbtitl column: Call
.fornia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, New
c/ýýrn~d//
HIanmpshire, New Mexico, Oregon,
W\ashington, Virginia-81.
The chairmen of both part ites claim
ed the states, and the advantages
seem to be in favor of the It*publi
cans in the state of Indiana, Minne
sota, Oregon and West Virginia, al
though at times Wilson assumed the
lead in soime of these. In the other
states listed as dloubtful the )Demnocrats
had the advantage, California's i:
votes being especially favorable to the
Democratic calculators. The vote in
Indiana was very close, Oregon, Idaho,
Washington and New Mexico were at
times reported to have Wilson major
ities, and New Hampshire came to the
front with a slight lead for the )Demo
cratic tiicket.
In view of these conditions and in
dications, Chairman NMcCornick confi
dently asserted that Wilson would
have a total of 314 votes in the elec
toral college. He asserted that the
victory is emphiiiahsized by the reluc
tanice of the enemy to admit defeat,
and is a conmplete repudiation of the
unfounded claims sent over the cotn
try by the etpubllican National Conm
Inittee."
Thie Republicans have not, on the
face of the returns, overcome the
Democratic majority in Congress.
With about 100 congressional districts
still to be heard from, the Republicans
had made a net gain of eight members
in the house, but late returns from
New York indicated that two of these
might he reversed.
With a net gain of eight, it would
leave the house with a Democratic
majority of seven.
In the Senate the Democralts show
ed losses from New York, New Jet
sey and Maryland. The indications
were they would lose the two sena
tors from Indiana, one from West Vir
ginia, and possibly one each in Ohio,
Montana and Arizona. The Demo
crats, however, gained three senators
from Rhode Island, Delaware and
Utah. Conceding all probable Repub
lican gains would give a net Republi
can gain of seven in the Senate and
leave the Democratic majority at two.
Republican Claims Disputed.
New York.-Senator Wiliard Sauls
bury, chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, gave
out the following statement:
"The Republicans' claim that they
will control the United States Senate
is absurd. The returns received by
us indicate the loss of only two
Democratic senators and a gain or
four. This does not include the Dem
ocratic senator in Indiaia, where the
result is still in doubt."
Democratic party leaders insist that
control of the house had not been lost
and that the Senate certainly would
remain Democratic. Republican lead
ers, however, were claiming the house
and still hopeful of victory in the
Senate.
Results in South Dakota.
Sioux Falls, S. D.-South Dakota
gave its five electoral votes to Hughes,
adopted statewide prohibition, gave
women the franchise, elected two,
and possibly three, Republican con
gressmen, and a full Republican state
ticket. Hughes won by not less than
12,000 plurality. Peter Nordick, Re
publican candidate for governor, will
have more than 25,000 majority, Pro
hibition was adopted by probably 25,
100 and equal suffrage by 10,000.
Philadelphia Again Republican.
Philadelphia.-Pennsylvania, which
cast its electoral vote for Theodore
Roosevelt four years ago, swung back
into tbe Republican presidential
column by.giving Hughes a plurality
of about 200,000.
-Returns from 31 of the 36 congres
sional districts in the state show a
Democratic gain of one, but Incom
plete returns from the other districts
may wipe out this gain.
New Orleans.-There were 1I
amendments on the ballot. All have
apparently carried, except No. B,
which would have given women the
right to serve on boards of correction
and- education.

The flowing oil well brought in at
BaYou Boullon by the Gult Refining
Company and Messrs. Emerson and
Sutton, is still flowing without inter
ruption, it is announced at St. Mar
tinville. The oil is of a very fine
grade, and is completely free of sand
and of water. All who visit this field
report that there is no doubt that an
-extensive oil field has been opened,
and that Louisiana has made another
step forward as a leading oil produe
ing state. The field is situated on
the deep Atchafalaya river with nav
igable water at all times to Plaque
mine, the Mississippi river and all
points on the Teche.
The exact location of the well is in
St. Martin parish, in section 13, town
ship 9, south range 8 east, in the south
western land district of Louisiana,
situated on the property of the Bayou
Bouillon Real Estate and Improve
ment Company, Limited, and the Atch
afalaya Oil and Mineral Company,

STATE HAPPENINGS.
Two Baton Rouge girls, sisters, were
married several days ago at almost
the same hour and neither one knew
of the other's marriage until several
hours afterwards. The girls were
Misses Johnnie and Minnie Lee. Miss
Johnnie Lee went to Alexandria "for
a vacation." There, she met Bernard
Smith, of Blackwell, Okla., and they
were married. By the time a telegram
announcing the wedding was received
here, addressed to Miss Minnie Lee,
that young woman had become Mrs.
Tom Moreland, the marriage having
been solemnized by Rev. R. F. Gehr
ing at the Baptist parsonage. Neither
girl had told the other of her plans
Mrs. Smith will reside in Blackwell,
Okla., and Mrs. Moreland will remain
in Baton Rouge.
Operations in the North Louisiana
oil Selds near Shreveport during the
last month have resulted in an un
usually large pencentage of dry holes
and a very small amount of new pro
duction. Of forty completed wells
twenty were dry holes, three were
Pas wells, and seventeen had an in
itial daily production of only 765 bar
rels, a decrease of 3,400 barrels from
last month's average and a decidedly
bad showing against the days when
wells were completed almost daily
which had an initial production of
from one to ive thousand barrels
each.
Opponents of the board of affairs
and other amendments have placarded
St. Landry parish with posters, ad
vertising meetings at yhtch addresses

jury, in special session, employed At.
torneys John J. Robira, of Jennings,
and J. A. Williams, of Lake Charles,
to tile a suit as representing Jeffer
son I)avis Parish vs. the Parish of
C'alcasieu. The amount involved in
the suit will approximate about $12,
500. The suit is similar to that filed
by the parish of Beauregard against
Calcasieu, contesting the settlement
mrnade by the two parishes under the
authority of the act which created the
parish of Jefferson Davis. The par
ish claims that the act is ultravires of
the articles of the Constitution requir
ing settlement to be made. The suit
will be tiled on the sanme ground as
that of Beauregard, with the excep
tion only that the attorneys will raise
the question of the constitutionality of
the act under which the settlement
is concerned.
