outlined the nature of a peace that would
be acceptable to the Allien and de
nounced the rffotta of Herman propa

The Premier declared that nobody had

wild :
"1 desire to declare without hesitation
or reserve that the Allies are lighting In

poses and their Interests are identical,
and a victory for those Interests Is, In
our Judgment, the only condition of a

Alluding to what he termed the pronaj

In this connection Mr. Asqulth charac
terized the German suggestion of a sin

Allies to combine against neutral coun
tries and build up an Unpenetrable stone
wall ngalnst their trade oh childish Ac
tion, which could only mean that the
Allies were bent upon economic suicide.
He snld It ought to be unnecessary to
anil in thnt when the time comes for
peace nothing will be more essential for
the Kntente Allies from the standpoint
of simple self-Interest than to establish
and maintain the best Industrial and
financial rotations with neutrals.
Mr. Asqulth began his spei'ch with n
reference to Turkey, which country he
described as a subservient agent of Ger
man Interests and ambition, as was In
stanced, he said, by the fart that by lift

Wahhiniitov, Nov, ?. The situation
In northern Mexico was described as
"very bad" to-day by Secretary l.anslrg,
who Indicated that the whole Mexican
problem will now be taken up energetl
cally by the Administration. Tho pre
election political atmosphere admittedly
caused this Government to refrain from
making the seriousness of the situation
public.
The Stale Department's chief concern
U the growing strength of the bandit
bands operating In Chlhuanua. Their In.
creased strength constitutes a perpetual
menace to the American border and
blocks any efforta at real reform or con
solidation of First Chief Carranza's ef
forts to control the country.
Although State Department officials
will not discuss the future prospects of
the Joint American-Mexican commission.
It Is understood that Carranza's renre-
I rentatlves will have to adopt v different
course irom mat wincn tney hfcve h th-
erto pursued or this Government will rec-
of the commission.
It will be made known definitely to
CarraniA that there will be no further
discussion of the Immediate withdrawal
of Oen. Pershing's command from Mex
ico until It Is shown, that Carranza's
forces can tope with the bandits In the
north. If It becomes necessary. Gen,
Pershing's command will operate against
the bandits, preferably with the coopera
tion of the Can ansa force.

With tho House of Representatives In
doubt, the Republicans appear to have a
slight advantage which may he over
come by returns from close districts.
Tho late returns Indicate that they still
maintain . lead of two votes. A num
ber of districts arc wavering between the ,
two parties, however, and official counts
may be necessary to determine which .
i shall ultimately control.
Tm: Sun's forecast Is borne rait by
the Chicago Tribune, which contends that
the Republicans; maintain their lead by a
narrow margin.
I'pon the basis of revised returns the
Associated Press gives tho Democrats
n plurality of four. It gives them 21B
members and the Republican 211, with
tlx o districts undecided, three of which
arc normally Republican nnd two Demo- '
cratlc. If these doaiot change the Demo- j
crats would havea lead of only three,
according to thee figures. The Demo-
crnts would be obliged, therefore, to
retain their hold on the House to enlist
the aid of the four members of minority ,
parties who are classed as one Inde
pendent, ono Socialist, one Progressive
Protectionist and one Progressive.
The latest leturns abo Indicate be

Only onre befnre In a century had 11
Presidential election been so close. In
1S76 Mr. Hoyes received IS3 votes to
181 for Mr, Tllden.
As had been anticipated, the llnul
returns from California gave to the
President upon their face mtsje than
enough votes. New Mexico, shifting
from Hushes to Wilson iluiing tho

Charles 1J. Hughes has not vet sent a
