Wilson Wins With West
For the first time in America's history, the
West has elected the president.
President Wilson goes into the White House
for a second term without having carried a single
liastern state, with the possible exception of little
New Hampshire.
Plainly, the West and Middle West arc con
siderably on the map. Charles K. Hughes failed
to recognize that when he permitted Gov. Hiram
lohnson to be snubbed by his reception committee.
Hughes may also account for Washington's loss
as due in a large measure to his abandoning him
self. while visiting here, to a decadent group of
standpatters.
The West is progressive. Woodrow Wilson,
a progressive himself, gave the West recognition
during his first term as no other president did. Now
that his re-election is due to the grateful West,
the people of the United States may justifiably look
forward to an era of unprecedented progress. And
that is what the West wants —to move forward.

Re-Elect Him in
Spite of "Big 3"
By Perry Arnold
t Itmm f*t*ff Correspondent
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.- America has
chosen Woodrow Wilson president and
Thomas R. Marshall vice president for four
years more on the face of returns available
early today. There was only the barest pos
sibility that recounts and possible contests
predicted by unyielding republicans would
change the situation.
California did the business. Tho the vote was in
complete at noon, Wilson's lead of 4,244 votes was so
commanding that it appeared that no matter what the
result in the few remaining precincts, he would have a
clear plurality over Hughes. There remained, however,
the possibility of a division of the state's electoral vote
of l ?.
Counting California's entire vote for Wilson, and
that of New Mexico, his total in the electoral college—
disregarding states in which there still remains a doubt
—appeared today to reach 272, six more than necessary.
Hughes appeared to have gained 243 votes.
Two states were still in doubt —Minnesota and
New Hampshire.
And Woodrow Wilson apparently has been elected
president without the votes of the heretofore supposedly
indispensable states of New York, Indiana and Illinois.
He has seemingly won without aid from three
democratic leaders whose domination in those states is
popularly accredited them in the title of "boss." They
are Chas. F. Murphy, of Tammany Hall; Tom Taggart,
of Indiana; and Roger Sullivan, of Illinois.
Only two other presidents have been elected with
out the vote of New York. One was Grant in 1868.
The other was Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876.

CALIFORNIA SWINGS
TIDE TO WILSON
BY J. H FURAY
t frm HlnTf l'orrr«pm(l«'nt
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10 —
Returns from all but 20 pre
cincts In California give Wil
son a lead of 4.244 over
Hughes. The total vote in
5,846 precincts was, Hughes
461.181 and Wilson 465,325.
The apparent reduction In
the total vote of each candi
date was the result of a series
of revisions and changes where
official figures were substltut-
Ed for the unofficial totals.
An extra edition this morning of
the San Francisco Chronicle, one of
the stauchest Hughes supporters In
the West, conceded t'alifornla to
Wilson by a plurality of about P.,000,
and declared Wilson had been re
elected
the kale men today nnd fight them tomorrow and make a first
class dent in them when you fight.
The only way to fight those birds is to fight them all the
lime.
You don't learn these things in a class room, that's thn
trouble. You learn A square plus "AH plus B square and you
leatn about the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle, but
THAT IMIKSVT HELP; and the curious fact is that neither
dons anything else you learn there, very much. The class
room is an imaginary world and the kale men ate the real
thing.
Hut II was evident from the way Prof. Wilson went to
the mat about W alsh and the eight hour law that he was for
getting a lot of classroom dope and cutchlng up with realities.
If lie will lust Keep along that line steadily lie can make
his second term stand out in history.
There Is another kink he might well get out of his men
tal system, an I that Is the habit of viewing a thing (10m a
i Wlllcox announced determination
to press for a recount In four of
the close states-California, New
Hampshire. New Mexico and North
Dakota.
It was Willcox's contention that
the voters were entitled to know be
yond question who was their choice,
and there was no desire to have a
man In the White House on whose
title there was a cloud.
Dems Have Congress
The same incomplete returns
which showed election of Wilaon
also Indicated today that President
Wilson will have a safe majority In
the senate, but an exceedingly close
i one in the house. There seemed no
question but the senate would be
democratic by a majority of 12, but
in the house the margin of control
was so narrow that there was pos
sibility of five or six representa
tives of minor parties might hold
the balance of power.
The returns so far Indicate elec
tion of one representative by each
of the following parties: Progres
sive. prohibition, protective, social
11st and independent.
The Ix>s Angeles papers made
similar concessions.
Rowell Surrenders Conditionally
Chester Rowell, republican state
chairman, however, was not willing
early today to concede the state to
the president without qualification.
He admitted that California had
apparently gone democratic on the
face of almost complete returns, but
asserted he would not abandon all
hope until the official count wu
finished.
