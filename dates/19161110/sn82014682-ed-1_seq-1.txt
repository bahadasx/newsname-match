it will probably he of great value as

comparatively short.

EMPLOYER'S WIFE
Angry Yard Boy Knocks Down
Mrs. Peterson, Threatens
Her With Pistol I I
Mrs. C. F. Peterson, wife of Attorney
Peterson, was attacked this morning
at her home on Vancouver Highway in
Manoa, knocked down and threatened
with a pistol by a Korean yard boy,
Kim 111 Sung, who is now under arrest
Mrs. Peterson is not physically injur
ed but is so prostrated by the shock
that Mr. Peterson asks her friends not
to call on the telephone or to disturb
her until she has fully recovered.
The Korean nas been a trusted,
energetic and capable employe at the
Peterson home off and on for about
five years, according to Peterson, but
has been subject to spells of stub
bornness and Insubordination at times
which have brought about his dis
charge. Each time a friend interceded
for him and he went back to work.
It is thought that his action this morn
ing was brought about through some
Imaginary grievance against Mrs.
Peterson or from a sudden rage of
jealousy occasioned by her treatment
of other employes.
Sulks Several Days
Kim followed Mrs. Peterson into the
hot-house behind the residence this
morning, following an unwarranted
sulking spell of several days' duration,
and wanted to know why "they were
always fooling him." MrB. Peterson
saw he was raging and tried to quiet
him, whereupon he sprang up her,
carried her bodily out of the hot
house, threw her down on the lawn
and pulled out an automatic pistol
which he pointed at her.
When the terrified woman scream
ed and grasped the gun he seemed
to come to his senses, put the pistol
back in the holster and backed away.
Mrs. Peterson then proceeded very
slowly into the house, afraid to run
for fear he would shoot, and, inside,
asked the Japanese cook to protect
her. The Korean did not come into
the house but went about his work
instead, and Mrs. Peterson went with
her 5-year-old son, the only other oc
cupant of the house, to the home of
Mrs. John Stone, next door, from
where Mr. Peterson and the police
were notified. 1
Word was sent to the Mills school
nearby of the Korean's actions and
several of the faculty men hurried to
the scene to stay with the woman un
til the police came. When Motor
cycle Officers SIzemore and Hustace
searched Kim no pistol was found, but
it was later discovered, unloaded,
along with several cartridges in his
quarters. Mr. Peterson says he would
have had time to put the gun back
in the room and to unload it before
the officers arrived. The pistol was
of German manufacture, purchased
about two years ago by Kim and reg
istered by him.

CLOSED TODAY
William P. Fennell was considerably
surprised this morning when he saun
tered past the Imperial Bar to find the
buffet business running fuir blast.
James E. Thompson, the proprietor,
was recently ordered by the liquor li
cense commissioners to close the place
for two months' following his convic
tion by the board of selling "slop"
beer. The suspension of sentence was
supposed to have commenced this
morning but Fennell says there was
no indication of ft.
"Luckily I had the exact copy In my
pocket of the order made last Satur
day by the hoard when I passed the
place this morning," gays Fennell,
"and I immedia tely . stepped inside to
see What was the idea. Several part
ies were drinking along the bar and
the' bartender was shining the glass
ware with apparently no notion of
locking the doors. Naturally I was
so surprised for the moment that I
could say nothidg."
Fennell says Thompson was not in
the place.' The liquor inspector lmrrie
diately notified the board and the
saloon shortly started on its two
months vacahon. Fennell says
Thompson may have forgotten the day
or pos3ibly might have thought tonight
was (the closing time.

He asserted that the nvu It still dermis On tho vote in the close

ehanjre its asjKH-t. ' He says that aiiofhYial eoiait may reverse the nn
official count in some of the close states and that he will not a knowl
edge defeat until the official count is talmlated.
Xevertheless, the country generally holds that Wilson is elected
on the face of the returns so far known. He has a clear majority,
though small, of the states regarded as certain, and. of the states still
in duilt, he should win New Mexico and New Hampshire at least. As
t lie returns now stand. Mr. Hughes has no chance to win even if ho
should come out ahead in Minnesota.
Both sides are preparing for a' possible" recount' and the further
possibility of a legal battle which will array IJepuhlicanism against
Democracy in bitter struggle.
The reelection of Iresident Wilson was conceded last" night when
the majority for the Democratic nominee was increased by the late
count-in New Mexico and when the last hundred precincts in Califor
nia had -been reached and it was 'certain that the returns to oine
would not eliminate the Wilson majority. Some of the latest Califor-
nia precincts conntel, as a matter

At quarter to ten last night the returns in the oflice of the .Wo-
iated Press shovel that the lig light was over and that the President
had Uvn i-etnrnetl for another term. A ''Hash" was immediately sent
Mit throughout the country. This message was delivered to Secretary
Tumulty -at Ashbury Park, who greeted it with a shout of relief.-'
He hastened. to get in. touch, by wireless, with tlie President whn
is on the yacht Mayflower, en route to Williamstown, Massachusetts,
where he is to be present today at the christening of his granddangfV

in message in reply for publication.
Neither Mr. llughes nor the President has yet made a statement
on the result of the count as known. IJoth a re understood to be wait

Of the four states still considered to 1h in doubt Minnesota,
New Hampshire, Wyoming and West Virginia Minnesota and West
Virginia may finally be in the Hughes column, while New Hampshire
and Wyoming will probably lx in the Wilson coltimn. -

Legal Battle
Over Election
NEW YORK, N. Y Nov.. 10. The
Republicans are already preparing to
begin legal proceedings In every state
where the Democratic majorities : are
close, while thfj Democrats are also
preparing to .demand recounts In the
close Republican states, lest victory be
snatched from them.
Vance McCormick, chairman of the
Democratic national campaign com
mittee, has already consulted with
Judge Alton Parker, once Democratic
candidate for president; Morgan J.
O'Brien, of the New York firm of
O'Brien, Boardruan & Piatt, a director
of the Metropolitan bank and of half
a dozen other great corporations; De
Lancey Nicoll of New Yqrk, former
district attorney; John Barry Stanch

dent that the two political parties,
having emerged almost equal from a

will demand recounts in North Dakota,
New Hampshire, California and New
Mexico, where the total electoral vote
is 24 votes, r Should the Republicans
win in California or in the three others
combined the twitch would be suffi
