GROW POTATOES AND ONIONS
The advice of those In position to
Judge la for our farmers to grow more
Irish potuloi-s and onions next year
thun ever In fore. The earlier potatoes
are the most prolltablo for this section,
because they reach tne markets far In
advance of the potatoes from the north,
where tlie greatest crops are jalsisl. '
Tho price la certain to be high on
early potatoes next year because the
crop Is so short in the north tin year
that prnctlrnily none will be carried
over into next season. Tho farmers
in Kentucky and West Virginia will
find early potatoes profitable a a reg
ular crop.
.Onion are In good demand every
year at price that puy excellent re
turn on the Investment. It will pay
our farmer to give more attention to
till crop. ,
faro should be used to select and
keep a sufficient amount of good seed
potntoe for next spring, a It will be
difficult to procure them If the short
age is as bad as reported.

THE DIRT ROADS DESERVE
, ATTENTION NOW.
Tho county that can afford to mar
cadomliu only some of the worst places
In it roads and Home of (he main lines
of trnlllc need not be discouraged about
Its hlfthwuys. After It has macada
mized tho roads where thu demand Is
ureal out It should have tlie other roads
laid out the best way to serve the peo
ple, und to Ket them on a Rood Kraclo,
not over 5 per cent. Adequate road
machinery should he bought and the
roads should be tfrnded nnd rounded up
so the water will run off of the roadbed
and Into tho (utters quickly. Culverts
and bridges should be put In as rapid
ly as means will allow and of the best
material available.
Hy this system the roads can bp. made
Rood for about elKht or nine months
of the year In the South. Then If spllt
InK road draft are constructed und pro
visions are made to use them after
heavy rainfall, nnd when freeze is Ko
to out of the soil, these dirt road can
be kept koi d nearly all of the year and
will come through the winter compar
atively free from ruts, so that as soon
a they dry off In the sprlns they will
if smooth and ill first-class condition.
The spllt-loK draK Is KivlnK satisfac
tion out In Missouri, where the soil Is
In the South, and is much Inferior to
the averaire road soil of our section. It
will do the work for us It 1 doinK It
In some case f Its use Is learned, the
roads are Klven the proper shape with
jjrnders, find then a plan Is adopted
that will Insure the roads being dra
Red each time when needed.
Some one most be hired to do the
work and an odlcial must nee that the
work Is satisfactorily done before It Is
paid for. It Is Just as well to pay out
,,me mn.iev for uslmr tho solit-loir dnur
as It Is to keep In r'l'dlr the hard-sur
faced roads- and to pay .an extra
amount of interest on the bond voted

HOW TO GET WINTER EGGS.
In order to obtain eggs it is neces
sary to have healthy, vigorous stock.
properly fed, and a good dry place for
them to stay In at night.
See that the fowls have plenty of
green feed. Always sow a patch of rye
for the chickens, or better still, have a
mixture of oats, rye, and clover sown
together.
Have a place for the chickens to
scratch. Put the wheat, corn and oats
In straw and let them scratch for it.
This will give them plenty of exercise
and help to keep Ihem warm.
Give one pint of grain feed to each
dozen birds twice a day, and just be
fore going to roost allow them to have
a hot mash made by cooking some veg
etables, such as turnips and cabbage,
and also using the table scraps, such
as cold bits of meats, etc., and mixing
this with bran.
Have a comfortable house for the
fowls. The sides, top and back must
be tight. Have the door facing the
south, and see thnt the floor Is dry nt
all times. , In order to have, healthy
fowls the house should be cleaned out
as often as once a week.

CAUSE OF COLDS.
Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 5. An ep
idemic of "colds" over the greater part
of the State has caused the State Board
of Health, through Dr. J. N. Hurly,
Its secretary, to Issue a short circular
on "How Colds are Caught," It says
in part:
All colds, and indeed all diseases of
the breathing organs are due largely to
air starvation. Overeating lessens re
sistance for a brief period while the
abused stomach Is trying to digest the
overload of garbage, and this abuse of
the body being followed by a second
abuse If not giving it enough air runs
resistance down so low that the 'cold'
microbes, which are everywhere, get In
their work.
'The sure remedy against colds Is to
eat moderately and breathe plenty of
pure ulr. Of course, the skin, kidneys
and bowels must act correctly, for If
they do not this, too, will reduce re
sistance and let the microbes grow in
the nose and other air passages.
'Every man Is the architect of his
own colds. Bronchitis, pleurisy, pneu-
monla and tuberculosis are routes to;
early death and they trail after colds. j

BEST BULLOCKS SELL
AT RECORD PRICE
AND ARE BELIEVED NOT
HAVE REACHED THE
' TOP. ;
TO
Chicago, Nov. 8. Cattle trade haa
shown decided irregularity this week,
especially on intermediate warmed-up
beef steers, bids In many instances on
such being a much as 50c apart. The
close on the bulk of these reveals little
change In value from a week ago, but
good to choice bullocks have been
marked up L025c and common grass-
crs have moved with some facility at
recent prices, cheap steers having a
worth-the-money appearance. A new
open market record top of $11.75 haa
been hung up on prime heavy bullocks,
and it Is not expected to stand long as
the record, confidence existing that $12
will soon be quoted, as the visible sup
ply of heavy-fed steers capable of high
dressing percentage is small. A year
ago the same class of steers was well
sold at $10.25. . .
In the hog trade the market hopper
has overflowed this week with pigs
and light weights, which have encount
ered rather severe declines, most of
them now showing a 5075c loss from
a week ago. This little stuff began
running late this year, but the market,
horizon is full of It, many growers pre
ferring to cash at light weight and save
corn. Packers have been threatening
to buy hogs during the wrinter, thus
Impairing feeders' confidence. Good to
choice heavy butcher and heavy pack
ing hogs sold yesterday within 25c of
a week ago.
Record Price for Sheep.
Live muttons are selling at record
pricesfor this season of the year and
will work higher as the winter ap--'
proaches. The range movement has '
dwindled to a comparatively small del
egation of feeders, but native and
warmed-up Western stock out of tho ,
feeding belt has been run freely ' this 1
week because It Bhows a profit and be
cause of timidity over running up a
heavy feej bill, the corn market hav
ing sonred still closer to the 90c mark.
Top lambs reached $11-25 on the week's
high spot, and, although $11 was the-:
limit at week-end, the trade Is confi
dent of a speedy reaction to higher
levels, prediction of $12 lambs before
Christmas being freely indulged in. v
The chief handicap to the beef steer '
trade this week has been a preponder
ance of one kind of cattle, short-fed
and warmed-up stuff. The percentage
of steers above $10.25 has been small,
while a large slice of the crop has sold
below $9.50. There is apprehension In
trade circles that the next 60 days will
witness excessive supply of warmed
up stuff that would have been carried
along with a less onerous feed bill.
The situation is peculiar in that while
half-fat cattle are being shot Into the
market regardless of what they realize.
many stockers are going Into sections
where corn Is realizing the highest
prices on record. Most of such cattle
will be roughed through the early part
of the winter for a corn finish toward
spring when they will have less com
petition. There are signs of subsidence
of the heavy marketward movement of
grassers from the trans-Missouri area
Six points have received about 25,000
fewer cattle this week than last. Beef
gathering in the West will subside In
seasonable manner and if liquidation
of half-fat stuff could be averted, the
market would doubtless give a good
account of itself.
Foresees High Trade Ahead.
Forecasts are dangerous alike to fore
casters and those who give them cre
dence, but the signs point to a high
winter and spring cattle market. The
board bill is high and short feeding
periods will be the rule. Unless news of
the Argentina drought is radically
wrong, exports will increase and di
minution of domestic consumption 1b
Improbable.
Beef trade Is not battling with cheap
pork as was the case a year ago, and
mutton is so high that sheep cannot be
regarded as competitors. Long fed
heavy bullocks have been selling this
week up to $1 1.26 rff 11.75. They are few
in number as the prices . indicate. A
few loads of choice long-fed yearlings
nave claimed Jll and better, but that
kind, too, are scarce.
Glenn E. Baker, o fTable Grove, 111.,
made this office a pleasant call
Thursday. Mr. Baker recently met our
friend Chas. W. Diamond, former resi-
dent of this City. He renorts entire
family all. in excellent health and
while the country at their
nresent
nome, Lamar, Mo(, Is a wonderful
country, they would enjoy a visit to
Kentucky. Mr. Baker, traveling sales
man in north and central states, reports
the country prosperous everywhere and
crops and money plentiful.
Miss Pearl Diamond, their oldest
daughter, formerly Mr. Baker's wife
together with youngest slater. Ruby
