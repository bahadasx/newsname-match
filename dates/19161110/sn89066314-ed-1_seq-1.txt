ST. LOUIS, 'Nov. 10 (3:30 p.
m.j Returns from several Repub
lican districts and revised returns
from many counties today reduced
the lead of Frederick D. Gardner,
Democratic candidate for Governor
of Missouri to 2,215. With 101 pre
cincts to be heard from, Gardner
has 372,179 to 369,964 for Lamm.
It js probable the total vote in the
outstanding precincts will, rjot ex
ceed 7,000. Unless there should de
velop large errors in the returns, it
is not probable that Lamm can
overcome Gardner's lead below 2,
000. Gardner Leads by 2,300.
At 4:30 o'clock today the Kansas
City Star told the MIssourlan that
Gardner was leading Lamm by 2,500
rotes, with 80 precincts yet to be
heard from.

KANSAS CITY, Nov. 10. Slashing,
unprecedented gains by Judge Lamm
in outstanding precincts in Missouri
late last night threw the Missouri
gubernatorial contest, which early
yesterday was generally conceded to
Gardner, Into uncertainty once again.
Lamm is now so close that it will take
an official count to determine the
election. The fight for Governor is
the closest in the history of the state.
Democratic headquarters reduced their
claims of yesterday, saying that Gard
ner would win by from 2,000 to 4.
000. It is expected that there will be a
sensational development In the elec
tion The St Louis vote will be con
tested on the charge of fraud and In
timidation. Republicans claim that 4,-
000 negroes were driven away from
the polls through intimidation by St
Lonis police. Judge Hukriede would
not admit a contest -but it Is known
that the Republican city committee
have such a move in prospect
Lamm's race in the country districts
continued to upset every calculation.
Counties that Wilson carried over
Hughes, Lamm is carrying by small
but sure majorities over Gardner. In
only a few counties has Gardner run

1VOMEX DISCUSS SUFFRAGE
Loeal Leagae Learns of Advantages in
Federal Amendment
The possibilities of equal suffrage
through a federal amendment were
discussed at the meeting1 of (he local
chapter of the National College Equal
Suffrage League last night. Using a
blackboard map which showed the
rights of franchise In the various
states. Miss Louise Tinch and Miss
Irene Fisher 'demonstrated the ar
guments for suffrage. Miss ' Tinch
gave a brief history of the federal
amendment and read the suffrage
platforms of the different parties and
the declarations of the candidates.
Miss Jean Schoen read "The Wo
man's Protest," a forceful presenta
tion of the reasons for enfranchise
ment. Mrs. J. Eu.Wrench, substituting
for Miss Helen Redding, gave argu
ments for suffrage emphasizing the
housekeeping phase of government,
for which, she said, women are es
pecially fitted. A general discussion
of the federal amendment, its consti
tutionality, the greater ease of obtain
ing it and the arguments offered
against obtaining suffrage by state
amendment or by individual action of
the state legislature, followed.
The report of the publicity commit
tee, headed by Miss Ethel Winner,
showed that nearly five hundred cards
had been sent to University women.
that-more than half these women had
declared themselves In favor ,of suf
frage and willingfto work for it, that
only 4 persons were definitely oppos

to Celebrate Election.

dents are Expected
Now that the re-election of Presl
dent Wilson Is assured, the Boone
County Democrats are planning a big
jollification meeting. It will be In th
nature of an' all-day celebration, anl
the probable date Is next TuesdayT
The present plans include no speak
ing, There will be a big parade li
the day time, and at night a torch
light procession of such magnitude
that Republicans who were not con
verted this election are sure to be be
fore the next, said J. E. Boggs, a
Boone County Democrat and member
of the state committee, who helped
engineer the re-election of President
Wilson.
"We will probably give a prize to
the township sending the largest dele
gation to the celebration," said Mr.
Boggs today. "We want them all. Re
publicans as well as Democrats, and
we think they will come. We expect
a thousand University students to be
In the parade." ,
"There will be no banquet, except
a few small ones In different rooms,"
and here a bystander winked an eye.
Mr. Boggs told of a Republican who
on Tuesday night collected money for
a Republican banquet on the strength
of Tuesday night's returns. "Of course
he had to return the money," said
Mr. Boggs.
EXPLAINS CALIFORNIA SPLIT
Two Roosevelt Electors Scratched
Four Tears Ago.
. Because of many Inquiries regard
ing the cause of California's"" divided
electoral vote In the election of 1912
and the likelihood of a similar situa
tion this year, the MIssourlan this
morning obtained from Dean Isldor
Loeb a statement as to how the split
came about.
"The largest vote received by a Wil
son elector in California In 1912 was
283,436," said Dean Loeb, "while the
largest vote for a Roosevelt elector
was 283,610." "Had every Republican
voter cast his ballot for all the elec
toral candidates of his party, Roose
velt would have received the entire
electoral vote of the state but enough
voters, because of the personal un
popularity of the electors, or through
Ignorance, scratched the names of Re
publican candidates to elect two
Democratic electors.
"Every state constitution at present
provides for the election of all elec
tors on the general state ticket, but In
1890 the Democrats carried Michigan,
and, fearing that they could not car
ry the state in the Presidential elec
tion of 1892, passed a law providing
that the presidential electors be cho
sen by congressional districts. By
this means the Democrats elected five
of the fourteen electors; but the Re
publicans soon got control of the state
and changed the law. -
"Maryland split her electoral vote in
1904, Roosevelt getting one vote and
Parker seven. One Roosevelt elector
through personal popularity received
109,497 votes, while the largest num
ber received by any Parker elector
was 109,446."
Dean Loeb says It is possible that
In this year's election all the Repub
lican electoral candidates In Missouri
did not receive the same -number of
votes. A few days before election one
of -the Republican nominees committed
suicide. The man appointed on the
ticket to -fill his place wap an officer
of the German-American Alliance, and
Dean Loeb says a number of Republi
cans claim they voted against him on
that account

- BT PERRY ARNOLD
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
NEW YORK, Nov. 10. Woodro'w
Wilson has been elected President
without the ,votes of the heretofore
supposedly indispensable states of
New York, Indiana, and Illinois. He
has seemingly won without aid from
three Democratic leaders, whose dom
ination is popularly known as "boss
ism." They are C. S. Murphy, of
Tammany Hall; Tom Taggart, of In
diana; and Roger Sullivan, ot Illinois. '
Only one other President, a Reputf-1"
lican.'has been elected 'without the
votes of New York. That was when
Hayes defeated Tilden. This is the
closest parallel in American history.
Politicians all over the country will
await with interest the administra
tion's treatment of the New York city.
Illinois state, and Indiana state or
ganizations. The concensus of ooln-
lon this afternoon was that there will
be "lean years" ahe'adfor 'ill three,
so far as federal patronage and recog
nition from the administration is con
cerned. ' '
Of scarcely less Importance today
than the discussion "of Hughes' defeat
even though he carried New York, In
diana, and Illinois, is what happened
in California. It was agreed that
Hughes must have suffered a tremen
dous cut since Hiram Johnson, Re
publican candidate for the Senate and
idol of the Bull Moosers, ran nearly
300,000 ahead. Apparently the Pro
gressives threw most of their strength
to Wilson.
Now that the election is over, a sum
mary of conditions found in Califor
nia by the writer who accompanied
Mr. Hughes on his trip into that state,
will be interesting. They play poli
tics very seriously there. Up unul
this summer there was bitter warfare
between the regulars of the old school
and the Progressives. Then came the
