from
1). T. Davis, aged 44, a resident Of
ScappooHe, was killed Krlday after
noon when the horse he was riding
threw him from the saddle. Mr.
Davla, who conducted the meat mar
ket st Scappoose, left his place of
bulni.M li the afternoon, riding a
young horse. He went to the "flats,"
bout one mile southeast of Bcap-
pooaf, to look over some beet cattle.
About tluak the horse returned to
Scappouao riderless, which excited the
luaplcion of several of his friends. A
Marching party was organised and
nt tu tho place where Mr. Davis
pt his stock. After an hour's
search his body was found on a nar
row put h on the edge of the pasture.
Tim supposition Is that Davis was
thrown from his horse and the large
tpur which he had on his right shoe
caught In the cinch, thus holding his
foot in tho stirrup. His shoe, with
the apur still on It, was found about
100 feet from where the body laid.
Coroner White was called, but as it
w evident as to the manner In
which the man mot his death he
deemed un inquest unnecessary. Mr.
While is of the opinion that Davis
"as Instantly killed, as his neck was
broken. His back was also badly
bruised, which showed he had been
drugged for quite distance after be
ing thrown from the horse.
Mr. Davis leaves a wife and two
children, all of whom were In Port
land when the futal accident oc
curred and did not know of It until
tliuir return to Scappoose. He had
only recently come to Scappoose, hav
ing bought the business of Ray Mor
ton. The body was taken to Portland

NEWS OF ELECTION;
COLUMBIA FOR HUGHES
Brewers' Amendment Overwhelming
ly Defeated.
At St. Helens the election passed
off quietly, although much interest
was manifested and work done. As
soon as the polls were opened the
voters started to vote, and all day
a constant stream of those wishing
to cast their ballot for their favorite
candidate was going to the polls.
Much interest was taken in the con
test for several of the county offices,
and supporters of rival candidates
worked hard. Barnett, the present
incumbent, rolled up a big majority
for the county clerkship over his
democratic opponent, McDonald, and
Mueller came through with a com
fortable majority over Smith, Inde
pendent candidate for representative.
Hunt, running as Independent candi
date, won out over Edwin Ross for
the treasurership, and Harvey has
about 1,000 majority over Zlllman
for county commissioner. Stanwood,
Blakesley, Allen, Van Orshoven and
White, who had no opponents, went
about their usual routine as if they
had nothing to worry about. Mets
ker, the republican nominee for dis
trict attorney,- rolled up a big ma-
orlly over J. W. Day, who ran as
ndependent.
Lewis, for joint senator, had the
voters of the county squarely behind
him and defeated Dr. Patton, of Port
land, by a large majority. The coun
ty gave Hughes a big majority, and
St. Helens aided by giving a majority
in every precinct. The vote In the
three precincts was Hughes 469, Wil
son 324, a majority of 145, or about
one-fourth of the entire county.- -
The land tax measure was buried
under an avalanche of "No" votes,
and the brewers' amendment suffered
a like fate. The single item veto car
ried by more than 800 votes. The
ship tax amendment carried, as it
should have, and not taking kindly to
the negro, mulatto and chinamen
amendment, the voters of the county
swamped this measure by 600 votes.
The rural credit amendment carried
by a good vote, as did the tax limita
tion measure. The stock running at
arge bill won by 2 votes.
RUBY IS LOADED; x
SAILS SATURDAY
Take Canto of 7M,000 Keet of Lum
ber for llalboa.
Cunt. Walter Wrlghtson was In
si Helens Wednesday, cloBlng up

WILL FIX ANNUAL
CITY BUDGET
TaxMiyers Invited to Attend Meeting
of Council Next Monday.
The council did not meet Monday
night, as there was no quorum pres
ent, but tho members present took
up informally the matter of tho levy
to rr.tse funds for the city's expenses
during the coming year. It was de
cided to fix this at their next regu
lar meeting, Monday night, Novem
ber 13.
' Since the valuations In tho city
have been decreased. It Is more than
probable that a higher levy will be
made this year. Tho recorder was
instructed to publish notices asking
interested taxpayers to be present
and aid the council In determining
what amount of money would be
necessary for running the city. It Is
quite probable that a 15 mill tax will
be levied In order to keep pace with
the city's growth.
ORDER MACHINERY
FOR FLOUR MILL
Contract for $30,000 Is Awarded for
Astoria Mill.

J. S. O'Gorman, Nlsqually Lumber
Company, Oak Point; Guy M. Stan
dlfer, Standlfer-Clarkson Lumber
Company, Portland.
For several weeks the mill men
along the river have had this matter
under consideration and the fact that
practically all of them have sub
scribed to tho agreement seems to
indicate that they are preparing to
handlo tho output of tho various
mills.
Contracts for approximately $30
000 worth of new machinery for the
Astoria Flouring Mills was awarded
Monday. The machinery Is to be in
stalled for the purpose of doubling
the capacity of the plant. The steady
increase of business and the demand
for the product of tho mill has com
pelled the company to enlarge Its
plant.
The machinery was ordered from
the Barnard-Leas company and it
should begin arriving by April 1
The work of installing it will com.
nionco upon its arrival. When the
improvements are made the mill will
have a daily output of 1,000 barrels
Twenty-five men are now employed
at tho plant and when the new ma
chinery is installed a crew of fifty
or sixty men will be employed.
BETS MADE ON
FAVORITE CANDIDATES
Much Money Changes Hands on
Election Results.
Several hundred dollars changed
hands in St. Helens on acount of the
election. At the start off the Wilson
supporters were ready to make even
wagers, but later thought 10 to 8
about the right odds to place on their
candidate. There was plenty of
Hughes money In sight and even bets
were quickly taken. Many wagers
wero made on the result in Oregon
j It is estimated that at least (1,00
! will change hands when the final re.
I turns are made known.
ANNUAL MEETING
ST. HELENS CREAMERY
F irst Year's ()eration of Institution
is Marked Success.
The St. Helens Co-operative
Creamery will hold its first annual
meeting Saturday, December 2, at
the St. Helens city hall. President
Tarbell states the meeting will be In
the nature of a get-together meeting
of the stockholders. He has ar
ranged for several prominent men of
the state to be present and make ad
dresses. Invitations are being mailed
to the many stockholders, urging
them to be present.
Though less than a year old, the
St. Helens creamery is an acknowl
edged success and its stockholders
will receive a dividend this year.
From a small beginning, It has grown
until it now pays out more than
$3,000 per month to farmers for
cream, and puts out about 10,000
pounds of butter per month. The
brand "St. Helens Best" is recog
nized as the best, and a liberal pat
ronage Is accorded tho company by
St. Helens patrons. The success of
the institution Is largely due to the
untiring efforts of President A. H.
Tarbell and Manager H. C. Jacob
sen. A few more similar institutions
would bring more prosperity to St.
Helens and surrounding country.
ASTORIA SAWMILL
TO SHUT DOWN
Because of the shortage of railroad
cars, tho big Clatsop mill at Astoria
has shut down and 200 men are tem
porarily thrown out of employment.
The manager of tho concern states
that the yards are filled with lumber
and that 35 to 40 cars are needed Im
mediately to relieve the congestion
and fill the orders. The railroad of
ficials have not been able to promise
immediate relief, so the mill was shut
down until such time as cars can be
had to move the lumber.
