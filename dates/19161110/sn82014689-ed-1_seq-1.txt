Fair Banquet
BigS
uccess
Without doubt, "Maui was out" last night, when everyone who
could possible get a reservation was present at the banquet given in the
new Grand Hotel. There were at least 250 people present at the din
ner and a number outside, who wanted reservations, but had to be
turned away, although seating room was made for , forty more than
hrst contemplated.
The decorations were exceptionally well worth while. The
stringers, from cocoanut palms, were supplied by the Filipino waiters.
Mrs. Rebecka Dienert planned the other decorations.
The Grand menu met with approval of all present. Serious talks
were made by R. A. Wadsworth, who presided as toatmastcr, and
Jack Walsh.
Joaquin Garcia, Jack Bergstrom, D. C. Lindsay, C. D. Lufkin and
"Buck" Thompson supplied the fun of the evening.
W. F. Crockett, with his usual eloquence, urged support for the
fair. All the otlier talks were good and in spirit with the evenings'
entertainment.
Both the Wailuku band and the Mary Hoffman orchestra supplied
the music for the dinner, and the dancing which followed.
Something of the semi-serious and semi-humorous nature of the
occasion is shown by the following "bill of fare" rendered:
Money, Tell Me How to Get It,
Honey," by J. J. Walsh.
1. While remarks may be out of
place, a few open remarks will be
made by R. A. Wadsworth.
2. Mr. Wadsworth will be followed
with a few immaterial remarks by
D. H. Case.
3. Tired and exhausted from the
lengthy and most uninteresting yet In
structive oratory to an extreme, the
audience will be relieved with some
good music by Miss Hoffman's Bunch.
4. A cut and dried speech which
has been repeated so often will now
again be forced on to the guests by
F. R. Cameron.
6. The strain being to much, a
rumpus by the rooster section of the
chamber of commerce is in order with
Leader Case.
6. A funeral march will now be
sung in ragtime melody, the title of
this little ditty being, "Maui in Fair
Time," by H. W. Baldwin.
7. --Some one will now make a stren
uous attempt to entertain J. Garcia.
8. It is Boothing to have some real
music, hence "Maui No Ka Oe" will be
rendered by Miss Hoffman's Bunch.
9. The next gentleman having in
sisted upon being heard, has selected
the topic, "Maui Fair Does Need the
10. It being impossible to keep the
lid on the rough-neck section, more
commotion is again indulged In by
That Bunch.
11. A sweet change, some elocu
tion, by Mrs. T. B. Linton.
12. The gentleman has selected a
most serious topic, "The Inevitable
success of an undertaking considered
most incredulous by skeptics, as ap
plied to the county Fair," by W. F.
Crockett
13. Some horse sense about pedi
greed cattle by J. C. Fitzgerald.
14. What relief to have good mu
sic by Miss Hoffman's Bunch.
15. Just a few words without com
edy, by W. L. West.
16. It being a fruitless attempt,
more commotion Is heard from The
Rooster Section.
The "Rooster Section" is a new
feature on Maul. It grew out of the
"rooster yell" which the Maui delega
tion took to the Civic Convention at
Hilo In September and gives promise
of becoming a famous organization.
It will be very much in evidence dur
ing the county fair.

low shdv, Maui went strongly Re
publican and every man on the

made possible by the courtesy
of the cooperation and the sup

and the Star-Bulletin.

come of the local contest be
tween George Cooke and Dr.
Raymond that the most interest
was shown. Although nearly a
hundred persons waited until
almost midnight to get the main
land returns from Honolulu.
