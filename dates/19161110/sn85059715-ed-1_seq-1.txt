How much Teal money yon might
have made with that $100 of yours
lying in the savings bank is demonstrated
by H. L- Barber, well known
financial writer of Chicago, in a book
which he calls "Making Money Make
Money." The book has started a
lively discnssion among wage earners
and savings bank directors.
"Safety first" is his motto on investments
but a wise investment, he
says, is the key to financial success
and a surer way to better one's financial
condition than to let the money
one has saved lie in savings banks at
low interest. He approves of savings
banks but asserts too much importance
has been given to saving
and boarding instead of investing
wisely.
Barber says that nearly every man
who baa acquired great wealth first
worked for others and saved.

country are now dry?or will be just
as soon as the prohibition laws and
officials elected on Tuesday can get
into action. Territorially speaking
more than seventy-five per cent of the
United States has banned the sale of
alcohol liquors under the cloak of
legality.

he declares, would ?ave yielded

Mr. Barber quotes other figures

Enormous earnings at banks, some
of which, he reports, are paying forty
per cent dividends to their stockholders,

by the willingness of depositors to

New Hampshire until the official count'

was classed as doubtful until late last ; I
night, has gone definitely for Hughes. i
Unless the rote of California Is divided,
which now seems a possibility.
Mr. Wilson is assured of 269 votes in
the electoral college, three more than
a majority, and Mr. Hughes of 243. The -Jl
president could lose three votes from

which will not be counted until .7vS

It was not believed the president's lead

The tension of the most dramatic .JSj
situation In the political history of the reunited
