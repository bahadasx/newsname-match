The only possible chance for the
Democrats to obtain a majority in tin
House will be the election of Demo
crats in all of the five doubtful dis
tricts. Tills would give them 220, and
a majority over all of live.

a plurality of six and a possible ma
jority of one, hut revised returns from

Tribunals That Must Pass on
Question of Choice of
Electors.
WASHINGTON IS INTERESTED
Federal Government Is Not Con

Be Shown.
Ill)' A?HiK'lali>d Pr?.". |
WASHINGTON. November I'.?i'!ov
eminent otlielals hero were deeply in
terested in, and not :i little concerned
over, to-day': announcement- from
Democratic and Republican ciimpalirn ?
leaders that contests might be ex- j
pected, with a possibility of lena 1 pro
feedings, over the votes for presiden-)
tial electors in several close States.
Kxamination of the decisions of the j
Supreme Court and of the Kevis< d Stat*"
utes disclosed that electors plainly ate
regarded as State ofllcers. The hitchest
court has held in two lending cases
that questions of their proper or Im- .
proper choice are for State election
officers of State courts to determine,
and that tiie Federal government Is
not lawfully concerned, even if fraud
Is show n.
The Revised Statutes provide that
the electors shall meet in each State
and "wive their votes" on the second
Monday in January following election,
at places to he designated by the State
legislatures.
In the ordinary course of proceed
ings. where the right of the electors is
uncontested, their votes would be
counted in the House of Representa
tives here on the second Wednesday
in February, and this would be the,
lepal end to the election.
The statutes further provide, that
wh'-re a State shall have laws made
prior to the election determining
methods by which controversies or con
tests over elections shall he settled,
whether by judicial proceedings or
otherwise, these laws "shall lie bind
in*;. and shall ijoveri! in counting the
electoral vote."
Ofllelals here were under the iinpres- .
sion that it would be found that all
the States that may be involved in ,
contests h:\ve laws of-this character.!
UOL'IIT liUCAItDIMi
POWKHS OK STATICS
Aside from the decision that the elec
toral votes of all the States !?<? counted
in the House on the second Wednesday
in February, there seems to he nothinu
to indicate just how* much latitude a
State might have in determining con
tests so as jo have its vote counted
at tli?.- fixed time.
When Congress meets t<> receive the
votes it is still possible for the ma
jority to reverse the certified return i
any State. As the votes are read to
the joint session, the statutes give the
right to any member of either house
to object, the objections to he con
sidered in separate session. When only
one return has been made from i>
State. Cong res.- cannot overturn the
certified result, except the two houses
concurrently may reject any vote where
it appears not to have been given by
the properly chosen electors. Where
more than or.e certificate for a State
has been sent, the vote of those electors
who. the two houses shall concur
rently decide, have been been sup
ported in a contest by the proper State
authorities shall be received and ac
credited.
Where there has been no determina
tion of a contest by State authorities
and there is more than one certificate
returned, the choice as to those prop
erly selected is with the two houses.
If the two houses disagree, the certifi
cate signed by the executive of State
concerned shall be binding, and the
votes so certified counted. The Con
stitution provides that where an elec
tion is thrown into the House, a se- ,
lection must be made by March A fol
lowing the election, but this appar
ently is intended only to cover cases
where there is a tie. and whether it
applies to those where there is a dis
pute over electors from a State or ,
States is not clear.
.MIGHT HOLI) CANVASS
? OPKN TO MA It CI I I
Should contests and recounts over
Tuesday's election before State can- j
vassing boards, or in State courts, con- j
sume such time that the Governors
would be tillable to certify the final
result by the time Congress meets in ?
February, it was believed by legal ex
perts that the final Canvass could he ?
held open until March ?!. and that a
selection will.be made by that time.
Upon the question of State jurisdic
tion over choice of electors, several ,
cases have been before the Supreme '
Court, but apparently none directly on I
the question of jurisdiction over a re- j
count of such electoral votet. In IS!tO. ?
in a Virginia case, upon prosecution j
for fraudulent voting for electors. Jus- ,
tice Gray said the only powers of the ?
Federal government with regard to the :
appointment or the votes <>f presiden
tial electors "are those which authorize j
Congress to determine the time and
the day on which they shall give their .
votes, and which direct that certifi- j
cates of their votes shall be opened I
by the President and Senate in the ,
presence of both houses, and the votes ;
counted."
Although electors are appointed tin- '
tier the Constitution, they are no more
ofllce rs or agents of the United States I
than are members of the State l.egls- J
latures. when acting as electors of i
Federal Senators. j
