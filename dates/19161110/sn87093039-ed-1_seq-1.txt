CITY PRIMARY RESULT
IN ELECTION TUESDAY
Mayor, City Clerk, City Attarney and
Four Countilmen Nominated at
Tuesday's Election
Because the primary nomination of
the city officers fell on the day of the
general election it was completely over
shadowed, and less than the usual
amount of interest was taken, tho the
vote cast was in keeping with the gen
eral election vote. No filing having
been made for councilman in the
Second ward the nomination for this
place was decided by 21 votes, Mr. J.
E. Shubert receiving 6 and Mr. N.
Montgomery reieiving IS. Mr. Mont
gomery's name will go on the election
ballot in December.
Following is the vote and result:

[lection Developed Usual Num
ber of Surprises
Last Tuesday's election held really
more than the customary number of
surprises, not the least of which was
the swing of Utah into the democratic
column. The defeat of Chelan coun
ty's candidate for representative, Mr.
Sumner, by Mr. Pool of Wenatchee,
came as a surprise to Mr. Sumner's
friends in the upper valley. The de
feat of Mr. Adams for joint senator
from Chelan and Kittitas counties in
his home county will preclude Chelan
from asking for this position in the fu
ture. The republican party in Kittitas
stood loyal by Mr. Adams, giving him
upward of 300 majority, with a possi
bility that this miy overcome his ad
verse vote in his home county.
Choked to Death on Bite Apple
The death of the three year old son
of Mr. and Mrs. J. N. Leary last Friday
evening was due to a roost unusual
cause. About five o'clock the little
fellow, while eating an apple, tried to
swallow a piece which was too large
and lodged in his throat. He became
unconscious and a physician was sent
for. When he arrived the child was
still unconscious and Dr. McKeown
made an incision in his throat and
removed the obstruction but life had j
already fled. Nothing that the doctor
could do would bring it back. Mr.
and Mrs. Leary are old citizens and
highly esteemed. They have the sym
pathy of a large circle of friends.
Work on Blewett Pass is Sus
pended
Forest Supervisor Sylvester tells the
Echo that work on the Blewett Pass
road was suspended this week on ac-1
count of weather conditions. Work j
will be resumed next spring as early as '
conditions will permit. We nwht
also say in this connection that more
work will be done on this important
pass than first contemplated. All the
grades will be brought to practically
five per cent and the road widened,
and turnouts made and the road made
the equal of any of the state toads.
The ladies of the Methodist church
are holding a parcel sale and will give
a chicken supper in The Echo build
ing today.

large Crowd Heard Election Returns at
The Scenic Theatre
Manager Barclay, of the Scenic
theatre, arranged to take the Western
Union election returns Tuesday night
and the theatre was packed with men
and women who were anxious to hear
the returns as they were flashed over
the wires. Between the reading of the
returns he gave the audience a series
of pictures that helped to while away
the time and keep the audience in a
good humor. The last returns came
in about two o'clock and found all the
seats filled with men and women. It
soon became aDpirent that the election
would be close and the result not fi
nally determined in the first night's re
ports. As results favorable to one or
the other supporters of the candidates
were read they would cheer and clap
hands. Some lively but harmless bad
inage was indulged in.
Apple Shipment and Car Short-
Mr. Motteler says car shortage is a
clog to apple shipment from Leaven
worth, as elsewhere. So far he has
ship, sixteen cars and has over three
cars in the warehouse ready for ship
ment if the cars were forthcoming.
There are a lot of apples yet to go for
ward but delivery is not being rushed
because of the difficulty of getting
cars. The Leavenworth stock com
pares favorably in size and color with
the best in the valley. Charley Fox
exhibited some Winter Bananas that
outclassed anything that came under
our observation this year. His trees
are mostly young and not yet in full
bearing. Once they get into the full
bearing stage he will be reckoning his
crop by the car load instead ol by the
hundreds of boxes.
Election Officials Strike
On election day at Kenosha, Wis.,
the election officers struck for higher
pay. The law provides for $6 per day
and the officials wanted $10 per day.
The city council refused to grant the
request. The dispatch did not state
whether an election was held in Ke

SHALL APPLE GRADING
RULES BE CHANGED?
The Question Will Be Decided by the
Growers on the Last Day of Na
tional Apple Show
Much has been said about changing
the rules for grading the Washington
apple. Some contend they are too
rigid. Others say the future of the
Washington apple business can only
be maintained by keeping up the high
standard of the pack. The meeting of
representatives from every part of the
state will be held in Spokane Nov.
25. Every apple district in Washing
ton will meet and elect a delegate to
represent the wishes of his district.
Leavenworth is entitled to one voice in
that conference. The representative
from Leavenworth will be selected at a
meeting called to be held at the city
hall tomorrow, Saturday, Nov. 11.
Out of the total of the 80 delegates
allotted to the North Central Washing
ton district the Leavenworth district
has 1 delegate to the Spokane conven
tion. The delegates will be elected
by all the fruit growers in the Leaven
worth district at a meeting called by
District Inspector Brown, at the City
Hall, Saturday, Nov. 11, at 2:30 p. m.
At this meeting each and every in
vidual fruit man will be given an op
portunity to express his opinion con
cerning what should constitute each
grade.
A meeting of all the delegates
elected from the several districts of the
Wenatchee North Central Washineton
country will be held in Wenatchee
Saturday afternoon, November 18.
At the Wenatchee meeting the
wishes of the growers from the Wenat
chee North Central Washington district
will be decided upon.
The meeting at Leavenworth, Satur
day, Nov.- 11, is the all-important
meeting for the growers of this section.
It is the one big chance to let your
wants concerning the grading rules be
known.
A meeting is called at Leavenworth
Saturday, Nov. 11. at 2:30 p. m., in
the City Hall; at Peshastin, Now. 13,
Incomplete Returns, County Officers, General Election, Nov. 7,1916

Test Electric Smelting
At the request of the Industrial com

Commerce, the department of Mining
of the State College of Washington is
investigating the commercial possibili
ties of the the production of iron by
electric smelting in the vicinity of
Spokane. With the known iron ore
deposits of Stevens county and the
wealth of electric power developed near
Spokane, this field is worthy of thorough
investigation.

THE APPLE GRADE AND PACK
WHAT THE LAW PROVIDES
How It Shall Be Settled By the Growers
Representation Based on Tonnage
—Annual Meeting at Spokane
Saturday, November 25, 1916, the
last day of the National Apple Show,
has been selected as the next date for
the general meeting of fruit growers,
officers of applegrowers' organizations,
and dealers in apples to decide on
grade and pack rules for the season of
1917. As the law provides for this
annual hearing or conference, it is
sincerely hoped that all fruit growers,
particularly in the commercial apple
growing districts, will make known
their wishes with reference to any de
sired amendments to the present grad
ing rules. We are asking that local
or district meetings be held in advance
of the final conference, and that differ
ent localities be represented at the
Spokane conference.
Section 17 of the Horticultural laws
authorizes a public hearing annually
with horticulturists in order that a full
and impartial opportunity may be given
all interested districts to be heard in
establishing of grading rules for apples
for the ensuing year. Sections 16 and
17 are closely related in that they pro
vide for a "Washington Standard Pack"
for apples; provide for the defining and
adoption of the grade requirements and
specify what constitutes proper brand
ing of closed packages of apples.
The law specifies that representation
shall be on a tonnage basis,but as the
1916 apple shipments are incomplete
at this date, we are designating a cer
tain number of votes or delegates to be
allowed each district, and in doing this
the commercial apple tonnage as it
looks at this time is made the basis.
The following is the apportionment we
are making as a basis of representation:
Wenatchee North Central
Washington 80 votes
Yakima 80 votes
Walla Walla 6 votes
Spokane Valley 10 votes
White Salmon and Husum 2 votes
Total 178 votes
Voting may be done by proxy, but
one delegate may not cany more than
four proxies.

Storm Damage Yesterday
Some time between four and six
o'clock yesterday morning the sleep
ing population of this town was aroused
by a wind of almost tornadic intensity.
Everybody got up and closed windows
and secured doors. In the maiu part
of Leavenworth the damage consisted
principally of damage to roofs, some of
which were stripped of tin and com
position roofing. Sky lights were
damaged and everything loose, like
bill boards, ash cans and small articles
were sent flying. In the western part
of town the storm did serious damage.
The new home of Geo. Watson, in the
Merriarn addition was damaged fully
