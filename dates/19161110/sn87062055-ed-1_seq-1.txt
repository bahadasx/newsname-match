MOTORCYCLIST'S RUMBLING
ROIDJICE NOW ON
The big motorcycle race from
Springerville to Phoenjx is now on.
The riders were supposed to reach
Flagstaff last night and, Flagstaff
being "night control," whatever that
is, will hold up the speeders until 6
a. m. this morning at the Babbitt gar
age, and then turn them loso on the
country again headed for Phoenix and
'the state fair grounds. The special
rules of the game are that they leave
Springerville at 7 o'clock a. m. Thurs
day morning and must reach Flag
staff before leaving tfiis morning at
6 o'clock. This seems reasonable.
The riders are to make one mile lap
of tho mile track at the fair grounds,
then go down and report to the
Board of Trade. There is nothing
stipulated as to how much they will
be charged for -entering and leaving
tho fair grounds.
Each rider is supposed to use only
one machine in this event and to keep
it oiled and gasolined at his own ex
pense and on his own time.
Machines can not be touched after
checking in at control though you
may touch the rider.
The betting master says that under
the rules the game is only open to
motorcycles of the 61 cu. in. displace
ment or less. Under the circumstan
ces it would, seem that all the sub
marine "U" boats were disbarred
from attempting to dip through the
Roosevelt dam on the trip.
This swift slosh across the country
was kept on the quiet until just a
short time ago when the German em
bassador, Tom Shaughncssy, state
fair secretary, divulged it, consequent
ly there will be only a few people who
will realize all that is going through
v Flagstaff today.
May the first man win if he gets
there the furstest

IT RAGE STILL IN
CAMPBELL
California, North Dakota and New Mexico With 21 Electoral Votes, Still in Doubt Wilson is Apparently
Leading in California Campbell is Leading Hunt by Narrow Margin
While the streets were alive with
automobiles and workers Tuesday, it
was a quiet, orderly election with but
little excitement of any kind to mark
it from any other day of the year.
Flagsatff's four precincts polled a
record vote of 1202, and was yet short
of the registration.
A complete official return has not
been made up to the present writing,
of the county and state tickets, but
so far, and there is little possibility
of their being a change, the following
county ticket has been elected:
State Senator H. E. Campbell, D.
Representative T. H. Cureton, R.
Supervisors Fred Garing, R., Chas.
Woolfolk, D.
Sheriff W. G. Dickinson, D.

Reports from over the state and
from other states are exceedingly
slow in coming in and the Sun office
has been beseiged with telephone
J calls as to latest results, but regard
less of repeated wires, was unable to
get definate information, good or bad.
' Meager information indicates that
the prohibition amendment was car
ried by a large majority.
Regardless of conflicting reports, it
is generally conceeded that Florida,

JOHN FLYNN PASSES AWAY
John Flynn, better known among
his comrades and hundreds of friends
throughout Northern Arizona, as
yShorty" Flynn, passed away at tho
Milton hospital Tuesday evening at
10 o'clock. A short time ago he was
operated on for an attack of appendi
citis which attack same upon him
suddenly; for a day or so after the
operation hope of his life was given
up, but a day later he rallied and
there was every hope of his finally
recovering, but In a few short hours
a turn for the worst came and he
passed away. He was In apparent
good health when seized with hi
fatal illness, but lthad gone too far
and blood poisoning set in, resulting
in his death.
Mr.' Flynn was born In Dundee,
Scotland, August 4th, 1870 and came
to New York when a young child.
For over twenty years he has made
Arizona his home. On the 4th of last
October he was married in Los An
geles to Miss Mollie O'Farell, daugh
ter of Mr. Ed. OTarrell of this city,
and came to Flagstaff to make their
home, having recently fitted up a
cozy home of his own on North Le
roux street.
Mr. FJynn was strong In his friend
ships and his friends were numbered
among all who knew him, especially
among the sturdy men of the woods
where he had achieved an enviable
reputation as cook
His death is made sadder by the
leaving of a happy bride of but a
month to mourn his sudden and un
timely passing
The funeral services will he held at
' the Catholic church tomorrow (Sat
urday) morning at 9 o'clock. All
friends of the family arc invited to
, attend.
Getting Ready to Handle Ore
Robt. Mitchell, general manager of
the Navajo Copper Company has been
busy the past few days getting out
plans and specifications for a large
number of ore bins, one building for
tho mines, another at the end of the
streatch of sand road and another for
Flagstaff. In solving the transporta
tion problem, Mr. Mitchell has con
cluded that a "caterplller" can take
the ore across the bad sand country
and deposit their loads there and
from there on into Flagstaff a faster
means of conveyance can be used.
There are many tons of ore ready
for transportation as soon as equip
ment Is secured for the service.
Locke, Famous Roadster Here
Harry Locke, the good road logger,
was in Flagstaff Saturday from the
south to ascertain whether or not it
was advisable to log tho north and
( south road to connect it up with
Roosevelt and Phoenix. He concluded
j that It was rather too late in the year
1 to make the attempt and left for the
west in his roadster.

PATRIOTIC STATE OFFICIALS
MAY EVENTUALLY PUT UP
THE JSTUBICIL FLAB
The flag of the historic frigate
"Constitution" will be placed on ex
hibition in the rotunda of the state
house at Phoenix as soon as an ap
propriate case can be built for the
ensign. The flag was presented to
the state of Arizona by the town of
Flagstaff on July 4, and Is said to be
one of the oldest American flags in
existence. It was flown by the "Con
stitution" in the battle of 1812 an,d in
numerous other engagements. The
flag has thirteen stars.
There was probably a feeling of
jealousy on the part of the state offi
cials owing to the fact that the histo
rical old flag might detract from the
glory of the "Constitution" of Ari
zona, otherwise it would seem that the
old flag would have received a proper
place of honor in the state house long
before this. Presented on July 4th
to Governor Hunt and up to the pre
sent time no room has been found for
it among the other flags and historic
al relics given the state by patriotic
citizens.
The donors of the historic old em
blem of pioneer patriotism and love
of country have every right to feel
chagrined at the lack of interest paid
It by the governor and other respons
ible state officials.
We hope the old flag is taken care
of sometime.
CAMPAIGN WINDS
UP PEACEFULLY
The last days of the campaign were
wound up by the republicans at the
court house Friday night with a
crowded house, with an audience
which listened attentively to the ap
pealing remarks of the different can
didates on the county ticket. Fred
Smith, chairman of the county cen
tral committee acting as "toastmas
tcr" for the occasion, gave each and
every one a good send off as his or
her turn came to "perform." It was
a good meeting.
The democrats held their last at
tempt of the campaign at the Or
pheum theatre on Saturday night and
there was a good crowd out to hear
the democratic brethren tell their side
of the story and ask for the support
of the people.
Hon. J. E. Jones presided at the
ceremonies and boosted them all from
the state ticket down to constable, in
his usual masterly manner.
Ttien the next day the war begin
with a cold raw wind blowing to add
to the discomforts of the candidates
who were out doing their last bit of
hustling.
