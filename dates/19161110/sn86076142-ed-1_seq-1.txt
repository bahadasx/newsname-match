NEW YORK, Nov. 10. Wilson's
election as president 'of the United
Sjtitea was accomplished when Cali
fornia swung definitely into the Demo
cratic column early today. The only
states where the results remained In
doubt were Minnesota, New Hamp
ihire and Netf Mexico, with a total
o( 19 electoral votes. Unless there Is
decided overturn In district miss
ing, Wilson will carry New Mexico,
with Hughes leading In Minnesota.
The result will not be known in New
Hampshire until the official count is
eompleted. West Virginia, which was
classea as doubtful until late last
night, has gons definitely for Hughes.
Unless the tote In California Is
divided, which teems a possibility,
Wilson is assured of 269 electoral
votes, three more than a majority.
Hughes will hat's 243. The president
could lose three votes in California
and still have enough to elect. This
loss would be offset by New Mexico,
which seems certain that be carried.
If Hughes carried both Minnesota,

with twelve votes, and New Hamp
shire, with four, he would have only
259 votes, seven less than enough to
elect. Wilson could lose New Mexico
and three from California and still
win. The result in Minnesota may be
determined by the ballots of 2138
guardsmen on the border. They will
not be counted until the state can
vassing board meets Tuesday. Re
turns today in the state give Hughes
a lead slightly exceeding one thou
sand. .California complete, except for
26 precincts out of 5879, gave Wilson
465.66S and Hughes 462,I.'!8, a plural
ity of 3131 for the president. The
tension In the most dramatic situa
tion In the political history of the
country was broken when the Asso
ciated Press flashed the news that
Chairman Rowell of California con
ceded that state to Wilson. Frantic
appeals to expedite the returns have
been sent to the state leaders hour
after hour from the national head
quarters of both parties here. It has
been apparent since Wednesday that
California is . the pivot whereon the
election Is swung. .

James Hobart Moore, multimillionaire,

Among the more 'Interesting be
quests are several for 1500 each.
The recipients of these, named In
discriminately in the same paragraph,
Include Marshall Field, Sr., who died
several years ago leaving an estate
of $100,000,000; Benjamin L. Wlnchell,
John the office boy in room 103, Em

Mr. Moore, with bis brother, or-

ganlzed the Diamond Match company,
and they were active In the forma
tion of the United States Steel cor
poration. A codicil in Mr. Moore's handwrit
ing, written the same day the will
was drawn, is somewhat vague, read
ing: "I want my brother, William
H. Moore, to act with the balance. I
Ipve him and ask forgiveness from
him and all others." .
The largest outright bequest was
to his late son, Nathaniel Ford Moore,
for $1,000,000 This son married Miss
Fargo. His tragic death In 1910 is
said to have embittered the last days
ot his father's life. The widow of
the son Is now the wife of Lemuel
Hastings Arnold, Jr., ot California.
Another codicil provides a gift of
$100,000 to Mrs. Arnold, and a similar
sum to "my friend, Hildreth K. Blood-
good."
Many relatives and friends were
given $500 bequests to purchase me
mentoes of the testator.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10. Re
turns last night gave President Wil
son a plurality In California ot 3112
over Hughes. O. K. Gushing, chair
man of the Democratic state central
committee, claimed the state for Wil
son by 3100. Chester H. Rowell,
chairman of the Republican state cen
tral committee, declared the returns
showed a result to be determined only
by a recount, and said that no definite
prediction could be made. .
Returns from 6805 of 5870 precincts
give Hughes 461,385; Wilson, 464,497.
The missing precincts are from
counties about evenly divided politi
cally. The state complete may not
be counted for . 24 hours. It seems
very likely that the official count will
be required to determine the result.
Frank J. Jordan, secretary ot state,
predicted late yesterday that the
electoral vote would be split, as was
that four years ago in this state. He
said an official count under his super
vision probably would start next
Thursday.
Registrar Harry Zemansky of San
Francisco county expressed doubt
hat the, electoral vote would be spilt.
He based his position on the fact that
in San Francisco there was little of
it. The California ballot permit
Ing for all electors of one party by
marking a single square.
Mountain fastnesses and desert
wastes hid most of the missing pre
cincts in the state last night. To
many of these there was no tele
phonic communication. Humboldt
county, in the extreme northwestern
part of the state, awaited anxiously '
returns from eight precincts, reach
able only by stage. For more thaa
600 miles the snow . peaks of the
Sierras blocked communication in a
half score of counties, passes and
trails being drifted over. Furthejr. ,
south the arid eastern slopes graded
down into desert and sagebrush
where stages run only intermittently.
The large cities and the wonderfully
fertile valleys, which reach for hun
dreds of miles north and south of
San Francisco, were well accounted,
as were the sea counties In the main.
Starting yesterday with a plurality of
more than S000 for Wilson, the count
slumped as additional Los Angela
county precincts were heard from
and a rectification of figures there
benefitting Hughes by 1930 votes eat
the Wilson lead to 600 votes soon
after noon. In the late day, however.
