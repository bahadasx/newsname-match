After a nerve racking wait of 54 hours from
the time the polls closed, news of victory for the
Democrats finally came last night at 11 o'clock
when the lightning flash told that Woodrow Wil
son had been reelected President of the United
States It was a great Battle, and the greatest vie
tory in the political history of the nation The vic
tory was great in that the solid South joined hands
with the west and elected a president without the
turn of a hand from New York state and Wall
Street The Final result swung on the pendulum
of doubt for many hours until California swung
into the Wilson column and then a jgreat Demo
cratic shout went up from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf that made
the very hills reverberate The great shout was
taken up by the winged lightning and the news
was flashed around the world that Woodrow
Wilson had been re-elected president of the Uni
ted States The Senate is largely Democratic
while the I louse is very close with a probable ma
jority of four for the Democrats Republican
Chairman Wilcox still refused this afternoon to
"give up" and is still talking about the official
count Vance McCormick, the Democratic lead
er stands pat on 288 Electoral votes for Wilson.
