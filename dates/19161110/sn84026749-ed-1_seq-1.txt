CITIZENS OBJECT TO
Seventeenth Street Favored for
Extension Instead of Eight
eenth and Nineteenth.
Protests against the proposed exten
sion of the Capital Traction Company
lines In Eighteenth and Nineteenth
streets northwest to Potomac Park,
were made by residents and property
owners of the thoroughfares at a hear
ing before the Public Utilities Commis
sion today.
Objection was based on the ground
wiai iMgnieenin aim (Nineiecntn streets
are residential streets. Hurirpntinn win
made by Daniel Callaghan, of 616 Eigh
teenth street, that the extension be
placed on Seventeenth stret, which he
said Is wider and better suited for the
purpose.
Seventeenth street was favored also
by H. R. Webb. Alfred B. Gawlcr,
Adolph Loehl, and C. R. Reynolds, own
er) of property In Eighteenth and Nine
teenth streets. A petition signed by
twenty-ono residents and proporty
owners of these streets was presented
by Mr, Reynolds.
General Plan Favored.
William McK. Clayton, chairman of
tho public utilities committee of the
Federation of Citizens' Association, said
the fedcrutlon favored the general plan
of tho extension without reforenuo to
Its exact location.
Mr. Clayton asked, however, that If
the application of the Capital Traction
Company bo granted It be with tho un
derstanding that the Columbia line bf
tho Washington Railway and Electric
Company be permitted to use, tho tracks
of the Capital Traction Company at
Fifteenth Btreet and New York avenue
so that residents of the northeast be
given service to Potomac Park for a
slnglo faro, or that transfers bo issued
between the companies at that point.
Purpose of Extension.
J, II. Hattna, vice president of the
Capital Traction Company, said the
proposed extension was to furnish a
service to Potomac Park and the
Kroun of Government and nubile
buildings In Seventeenth and Eight
eenth streets. Ho added that conges
tion at Fifteenth street and New
York avenue would be greatly ro
lleved by converting westwaid part
of the traffic on tho Fourteenth street
line which now goes south on Penn
sylvania avenue.

HAS SENATE BY TWELVE
So Far, Republicans Have 21 1
Seats and Their Opponents
215 Sure.
The Democratic party probably will
keep control of the House, though by a
margin so slender as to make It un
comfortable. Tho Democrats have a
majority of 12 In tho Benato.
Of a total of 435 members In the House
the Democrats have elected 215. The
Republicans havo elected 111. Ono In
dependent, one Socialist, one Progres
sive, and one Progressive-Protectionist
have been chosen.
Two hundred and eighteen votes'' con
stitutes a bare majority of the House.
Five districts are still In doubt. They
Include four In West Virginia and one In
New Mexico. Two of the West Virginia
districts are normally Republican and
two normally Democratic
The New Mexico membership Is nor

May Affect House.
ThekIIotUe sltuatUra-isnrtrclose and
the problem as, to which side will
control It Is to unsettled that the
questions of contests for seats in
that body becomes one worth con
sideration. It Is fullv exnectei however, that
If the Democrats have control they
will seat all Democratic claimants,
and that If the Republicans have con
trol they will give Republican con
testants the best of It.
The procedure In the House in case
of 'a contest Is, after formal notice
of contest, to rrf' the matter to one
of tho three election committees. The
committee hears and consider the
evidence and reports to the House.
After argument, the House votes.
Each house Is the judge of the
qualifications of Its members. This
means that If there are contests as
to the new House thev cannot be act
ed on b the present House, but will
be acted on by the House which en
ters service March 4 next.
If tho final returns are on the basis
of the present House from the five
doubtful districts the Democrats will
have 217 and the Republicans. 213. This
would not give the Democrats a ma
jority of the House over all others, but
a plurality of three over the Repub
licans. It would saddle responsibility on
the Democrats, but make their control
constantly precarious.
As a matter of fact. It would give
the balance of power. In theory at least,
to the four members not of the old
parties.

PROBE
ON DESPITE
VICTORY
Department of Justice After All
Offenders Regardless of
Election Result.
INQUIRIES IN 12 STATES
Most Damaging Evidence Said
to Come From Detroit,
Where Prosecution Is Due.
Regardless of the outcome of the
election, the Department of Justice will
strain every nerve to convict and Im
prison every man found guilty of elec
tion frauds.
High officials of the department to
day made It plain that the elec
tion of President Wilson, which Is ac
cepted as certain at the department,
will not Influence prosecuting officials
to relax their efforts.
"These matters are not election mat
ters, but violations of Federal statutos,"
ono of the high Justice officials said;
"the Investigation will go on and prose
cutions will follow where the facts
Justify."
Twelve Investigations.
It was stated authoritatively that
election fraud Investigations are being
conducted In twelve States, Including
four of the States, which have remain
ed In tho doubtful column during the
last forty-eight hours. A v
urates in wnicn election molds are
being Investigated, are: California,
Minnesota, West Virginia, New Hamp
shire, Indiana. Ohio, Pennsylvania,
New York, New Mexico, Connecticut,
New Jersey and Michigan.
The most damaging evidence of elec
tion frauds. It was declared In authori
tative quarters today, has been found
In Detroit, where Immediate prosecu
tions are said to be likely.
Cover Everything.
The charges of election frauds cover
everything from ballot-box stuffing to
buying votes and Intimidating voters.
The department was advised that
United States District Attorney Hildreth
had begun an Investigation of charges
that ballot boxes In eastern North Da-

Gallons of Whisky
Are Lett on Train
Suitcase Containing Tea Settles
Filled With Liquor Pai
Through Virginia.
Among scores of trunks and leather
bags In the baggage room at I'nlon Sta
tion are three suit cases containing 150
quarts, pints, and half pints of "tea ket
tle" whisky, found on Southern train
No. 80 when It arrived shortly after mid
night from Kentucky. They had been
left on the train by supposed passengers.
And to think that this rare cargo of
tiny kettles filled with "Are water" pass
ed through the dry State of Virginia be
fore entering the District.
At a late hour this morning no one
had claimed the Innocent little kettles,
which the police say bear the label of
a Kentucky distilling company.
Police discount the theory that the
shipment was meant for some parched
Virginian. They point out boot-leg whis
ky Is usually handled In some more
compact way than in labeled tea ket
tles.
MORE DELAY LIKELY
IN LUSITANIA CASE
Torpedoing of Three Steamers
May Postpone Settlement.
Possibility of still further delay In the
settlement of the Lusttanla caso was
admitted at the State Department to
day, because of the recent torpedoing of
the American steamer Lanao, the U-lt-Ish
steamers Marina and Rowanmore,
both with Americans In their crews.
If further report on these eases
makes It necessary to present them to
the German government the Lusltanla
would have to wait for their settlement.
It was said at the department.
Thirteen Still, Wilson's
Lucky Number
SuperstitlouBly Inclined gafr In
stances today of Wilson's good
luck In the "hoodoo" number
13.
Apparently, Wilson won the
Presidency with California's
13 votes.
His majority in the Electoral
College appears to be 13.
Hughes, his opponent, voted bal
lot No. 13 on Tuesday.
Variety of Laws Apply
To Recount of Vote
Legal officers of the Goverment to
day found there are forty-eight vari
eties of election laws governing re
count of votes where returns are
contested. Study of election laws
produced so1 many varying statutes
covering the subject that officials be
came convinced thrc.aU of election
contests would end In talk.
No matter what legal steps may
follow by way of obtaining recounts
or Instituting contests, action will bo
under State taws, however, to that
the Department of Justice will have
nothing to do with such legal pro
ceedings as may be Instituted.
It developed that recounts will be
Impossible In some States, notably
Ohio, whero the ballots are burned
by elecUon Judges after the first
count is made. The only revision of
tho returns possible Is that made, by
election commissioners of clUcs and
counties, and with the ballots de
stroyed that revision Is necessarily
limited to chocking up the figures ort
the return sheets.
BIG BETS HELD UP
I
Some Stakeholders Won't Pay
Till Electoral College Meets
Next January.
NEW YOItK, Nov. lO.-Mllllons of
dollars ht on the Presidential election
aro held up-hWhe hands of stakehotd
until the fact la established beyond pos
ers, and will remain out of circulation
slblllty of reversal that President Wil
son has been re-elected.
How long that may be depends large
ly upon the final count of the vote in
Minnesota and other States still In
doubt.
Stakeholders generally declared that
there would bo no payments until the
outcome of .he election had been defi
nitely established and to the satisfac
tion of all pnrtlos. Several of the
largest holders went so far as to sug
gest that It might be unwise to pay off
the bets until after the Electoral Col
lege meets In January, and some even
decided to wait that long.
Among the stakeholders who declared
they would await a definite decision
were Fred Pchtimm. of Rrooklyn. and
Edward McQuade and A .8. Stokes
prominent curb brokers, who are hold
ing thousands of dollars.
Many small bets laid between Individ
uals were paid off today through signed
agreements releasing the stakeholders
from liability.
Total Near $15,000,000.
The total amount bet throughout the
country on the election Is variously es
timated at from $10,600,000 to t15.0O0.O00.
Of the total It Is estimated that JS.000.000
was placed In this city. Six millions
of this was wagered before tho polls
closed, and I2.0no.000 during the period
of doubt since election day.

New Mexico Joins President's Ranks.
NEW YORK Nov. 10. Woodrow Wilson has
been re-elected President of the United States, accord
ing to the latest returns from all States, with 272 elec
toral votes.
The President's margin is the smallest, but one,
in the history of elections in the United States. The
exception is that of the Hayes-Tilden contest of 1876,
when the vote in the Electoral College was: Hayes,
185; Tilden, 184.
The President's popular plurality on the face of
the present returns gives him an estimated lead of
101,310, out of a total of approximately 15,000,000
votes for the two candidates.
New Mexico this morning joined the Wilson pro
cession'. '
The 'three votes of that State added to the 269
already in the Wilson column this figure including
the thirteen from California makes up Wilson's total
of 272.
New Hampshire and Minnesota now are the only
doubtful States, and New Hampshire seems to have
gone for Wilson also. Its four votes would make
, Wilson's total 276.
! GUARDSMEN TO DECIDE.
In Minnesota the result is so close that the votes
I of the 1,800 guardsmen from that State now on the
border will have to decide the result. These votes
will be counted next Monday.
Governoi Hughes has not yet conceded Wilson's
victory, and Chairman Willcox, of the Republican na
tional committee, declares the fight is not yet over.
Chairman Willcox shortly after noon today issued the
following statement:
"The result still depends upon the vote of a few close
States. It must be borne in mind that the returns thus far
announced are in most States unofficial and may be changed
by the official count required by the laws of those States.
ffASES HOPE ON OFFICIAL COUNT.
"Twice during the unofficial computation yesterday in
California mistakes in addition were announced from that
State, substantally changing figures previously given. It
is common experience that the result of the official count
almost always varies from the returns first announced.
"Where the vote is as close as that reported in several
States, it may well be that material changes will result from
the official count. We owe it to the country to take all neces
sary steps to see that an exact and honest count of the votes
is made.
"When the current seemed to be running against Mr.
Wilson on Wednesday the Democratic managers announced
their intention to demand a recount in every close State.
"AH we desire is to make sure that the vote be counted

VIEWS OF MORGENTHAU.
Henry Morgenthau, chairman of the Democratic
finance committee, arrived at headquarters at 10 a. m. to
day. He immediately issued the following statement :
"We are positive this morning that there can be abso
lutely no doubt of any change in the California victory un
less possibly there is one in our favor."
The Republicans have organized a battalion of lawyer
headed by former Attorney General Wickersham, and aro
