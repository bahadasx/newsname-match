St. Paul. Minn., Nov. 10.
Eric L. Thornton. Republican
chairman, today stated that the
supposedly Democratic Northern
Minnesota is not turning out
very Democratic. He stated that
the counties vould not go as
Democratic as the Democrats
claim
2:15 o'Clock.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 10.
The Republicans refused to con
cede Democratic claims of Min
nesota this afternoon. The Re
publican figures showed that
Hughes was leading in Minne
sota by 1,114 votes. It is ex
pected that this will be cut to
1,000. The soldier vote, it is
believed, will cut this 200 more,
leaving Minnesota for Hughes
by 800.

Hampshire. N'ew Mexico and North

also probable.
Soldier Vote to Deride.
Although Minnesota returns as a
pivotal state are not important, in
dications are that ti vote of the
national guard on tbd Mexican border
will make definite Minnesota returns
impossible before nexi Tuesday With
Hughes leading this' morning by ,1,-
043 votes, the Democrats admit that
Hughes has perhaps carried Minne
sota by 400 votes, based upon the civ
ilian vote They then point to the
soldier vote which Colonel Luce of
the Third regiment, Minnesota mili
tia, gives Wilson 1,200 and Hughes
600. This they claim gives* Minne
sota to Wilson by 200 votes. The Re
publicans are silent on the soldier

of the year will take place Sunday af

Athletic rivalry between this city

BiG E SEASON
I PENS IN MINNESOTA
The big game season opened in
Minnesota today and hundreds of
hunters entered the woods in this
district after deer and moose
Besides Bemidji hunters, there are
a large number of hunters from other
points in Minnesota and from other
states.
It is reported that deer and moose
are plentiful. However, lack of snow
will hamper the hunters.
Up to noon today 600 big game li
censes had been issued in Beltrami
county.
Minnesota hunters can shoot either
a deer or a moose. Non-resident
hunters can shoot one deer and one
ruooste, but cannot take the moose out
of the state. Minnesota hunters are
opposed to the present law and a
change may be made at the next ses
sion of the state legislature.
