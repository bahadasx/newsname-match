Dakota by about
1,000. The presidential
contert has narrowed down to California
where the votes- are not yet complete.

THE MOST REMARKABLE
ELECTION EVER HELD.
PRESIDENTIAL
Not since the doubtful election of
Rutherford B. Hayes over Samuel J.
Tilden in 1876 by a majority of one elec
toral vote has there been so great un
certainty two days after the vote has
cast, as that of the contest on Tuesday
The first returns up to about thr&
o'clock on Wednesday morning and
which showed New York, Illinois, Indi
ana, Pennsylvania and all eastern state9
for Hughes, satisfied the waiting voters
that Hughes was certainly elected. All
the morning dailies said the same in
great headlines. Then things began to
change and the western states turned
the tide for Wilson.
As we write on Thursday morning the
result ib not yet positively known and so
many states have so close a vote that it
may possibly take an official count to
settle the issue.
Just at this present moment, we stop
writing to get a phone message to the
effect that the ballots of North Dakota
must be closely guarded as it is quite
possible that the five electoral votes of
this state may decide the contest, and
as yet we are not sure which way North
Dakota has voted, though probably Re
publican.
Both Republicans and Democrats lost
and gained in the contests and it seems
probable that there will still be a very
small Democratic majority there.
HOUSE
Returns as to representatives are
rather meager but the Democratic
majority appears to be certainly reduced
at least.
STATE
Frazier was elected by an overwhelm
ing vote. The support of the Nonpar
tisan league, and the factional fight
among the Democrats left McArthur
very far in the rear. Other state officers
followed the vote of Frazier, but with
reduced figures. The fight between
Steen and Casey, the latter being the
only Democratic state nominee with the
endorsement of the Nonpartisan party,
is yet very close.
There is little doubt at this writing
that Senator McCumber has been reelect
ed by-a good majority over John Burke
who was three times elected governor in
the face of a large republican majority.
All three republican representatives to
Congress have been re-electd by good
majorities. Mr. Bangs who opposed
Helgeson in this district made a good
run and carried
hiB
Grand Forks.
home county of
COUNTY
All the old officials were again elected
on Tuesday. We show the figure in the
in this issue.
The county very nearly split even on
the presidential ticket. The legislative
tight resulted in the election of the Non
partisan candidates Messrs Welford,
Genger, Pleasance, and O'Connor.
Mr. McFadden made a good run
but was handicapped by the fact that
over in this direotion many remembered
his course in the county seat fight while
over to the west they had apparently
forgotten it.
There' is little or no party significance
in the oounty vote. The entrance of
the Nonpartisan league threw both party
lines into confusion. We tmnk however
that the next election there will be some
different lines drawn. Some county
candidates who sought office under the
wings of the Nonpartisan party without
direct endorsement have been grievous,
ly disappointed, and are to day wonder
ing what they got in return for their
jiine "dollars and bard work for the new
party.
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
The general situation all along the
lines is unchanged. Italy reports some
progress, the Roumanians seem to have
checked her invaders except on the
south. There has been some rather
heavy fighting along the Somme in
which the French made a few meters
while the English were successful.
Along the Russian border nothing is re
ported except assaults here and there
with varying successes.
German submarines are more active
and it is in dispute whether they have
not sunk some vessels without proper
warning.
Th?re is considerable peace talk but
most critics think peace is a question of
the far future anl many think the war
will last two years more.
Personally, we cannot see how the war
can lastthat long. The drainage of men
is too great. If one begins to figure on
the promise that each warring country
will fight to the last man it is easy to ar
rive at along future for peace. But will
that be true? That might be brave,
but it would not be sensible, it would
not be human nature. Long before the
last man the certain end would be
known, After a certain time there
would be no possible object in longer
fighting. Sometimes small bodies of
ipen will fight to the end, but nations
do not. There is always a large body of
non-combatants like women and child
ren and the old men who are equally
concerned and they will not stand by
and see the last man killed without a
protest.
Already that kind of cost is being
reckoned in each of the warring coun
tries. Already the great laws are in
fluencing public opinion—and that is
why we are now hearing so much about
a possible peace.
According to a writer in one of the
current magazines the official figures
with careful estimates show that during
the two years of war that the entente
allies have lost ten millions, the Teutons
eight millions and the smaller nations
soma five hundred thousand in killed,
wounded and prisoners.
According to the same estimate, this
means that that the entente allies have
lost about one sixth of their fighting
population and that Germany and Aus
tria have each lost one third of the men
of fighting age.
In this way they figure that Germany
-for instance, can Jteep on fighting for
two more years before she is exhausted.
But this calculation does not take into
consideration that each year inoreases
the ration of casualities. To take the
German losses as four million, that
meane two million a year. Numerically
as long as tbe lines are as long as they
are now are, Germany will lose just as
many this and next year. But in ratio
to population if Germany has lost one
third in the last two years she will lose
almost half of what remains in two n*ore
years—or, in the four years she will
have had killed, wounded and prisoners
two out of every three of her fighting
men. It is true that some of these will
be able to return to tbe ranks, but the
aggregate is enormous in proportion to
oppulation.
If the results of the fighting in these
next two years are like those of the last
two years, there will have been nothing
gained by either side, by which to make
any better terms of peace than could be
right now.
Statesmen may plan and prophesy,
and generals may express views of the
future, but the one great certainty of
this war. the one greatest startegist of
this greatest of wars, is Death.
Eighteen and half millions of men
either killed, wounded prisoners in two
years. Can Europe, will Europe stand
the prospective loss of as many more,
without materially ohanging strategical
conditions along tbe battie lines? Can
they ignore the tears of tbe widows and
mothers and theories of the children for
two more years?
A NATIONAL HYMN.
The United States is about this only
country in the world without a popular
national anthem. Notwithstanding the
tact that the ''8tar Spangled Banner"
haB
been made semi-officially a national
air, we can still repeat what we said, for
it is neither popular or an anthem.
Musically it is not popular because the
ordinary voice finds it too difficult to
sing. Few men can reach the higher
notes at all. Poetically, it is only a song,
faulty in meter and not particularly ele
vating in sentiment. It is but a des
cription of a single battle, which as his
tory goes was not of a battle anyway.
We are not trying to run down the
"Star Spangled Banner" as a song, but
say that it has almost none of the re
quirements of a national hymn. A
national hymn must first be national.
Its words and sentiments must appeal
to the highest emotions of patriotism.
They must contain all the grandeur and
beauty of the lofty mountain. The
music must be of the sort that catches
the ear of anyone, whether skilled in
musio or not. It must be of the kind
that everyone may open their mouths to
the full extent and pout forth all their
voice. It must also be of a martial
nature and be written in marching time,
The music and the words must belong
to each other.
Our other national song of "America"
is but a makeshift and the music be
longs and is used by two other nations.
The poetry is just passable, but not
great in any sense. As a contrast, read
the "Watch on the Rhine" or the "Mar
seilleise."
We have one grand hymn that could
have filled the bill. As poetry it is one
of the finest things in the language,
both its spirit and sentiment are lofty
and grand, while the music is all that
could be desired.
"Mine eyes have seen the coming of the
Lord,
He is tramping out the vintage where
the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightnings of
His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on.
In the beauty of the lillies Christ was
born across the sea.
With a glory in his bopom that trans
figures you and -me
As he died to make men holy, let us die
to make men free,
While God is marching on."
Compare the above with
"Oh say, can you see by the dawn's
early light
What we hailed at the twilight's Ust
gleaming?"
or
"My country 'tis of thee, of thee I sing."
But because the "Battle Hymn of the
Republic" originated in civil war times,
because it was founded on the struggle
then going on, because it was a northern
hymn, it will never perhaps take its
place as a national anthem. But so far
as its words and sentiments go it is juat
as applicable to-day as then, and equally
applicable to the great struggle in Eur
ope, as if it were written yesterday.
Julia Ward Howe wrote the real "Bat
tle Hymn of the Republic" and whether
the. people of the United States finally
accept it as such or not, it will always
live and always bo "The Battle Hymn of
tbe Republic."
GOD AND THE PEOPLE RULE.
We write on the morning of election.
To-day millions of voters will go to the
polls and exercise their privileges of
sovereignty.
To day each and every man becomes a
sovereign. By the use of the franchise
he becomes one of the rulers of this
great country. By the act of voting he
assumes the office of president, performs
the duties of a congressman and sits
upon the bench of the supreme court.
For bis vote says who these shall be and
directs their future action. It is some
times remarked "that every boy in this
country has the opportunity of becoming
presidont," while this is but afar fetch
ed truth, it is true that every boy can at
the polls become a part and parcel of
this great government.
Even when tbe votes are counted and
some seem to have lost their votes be
cause the majority have decided contrary
to hi3 wishes yet in a certain measure
the minority have a strong influence in
legislation. Tbe majority always fear
that the minority may become the major
ity unless they act wisely. Corruption
is always rife in an overwhelming major
ity.
Hence it is the people, the common
people, who really govern. In the final
analysis they are the real sovereigns.
They are the appointees of and are above
all office-holders.
To-day's results will be far reaching,
because as all believe this is a most crit
ical time in our history. No matter
what the results may be to-day, In geu.
eral, the people will still rule. No pres
ident will dare, no congress will ears to
oppose the expressed wishes of tbe people.
Nominally the President may lead and
Congress may make laws, but if they
attempt to lead the people in direotions
distasteful to the them, tbe officials will
aoon find that tbe prosession is moving
in another direotion and they are alone,
and in consequence they no longer lead.
It is
easy to lead in the direotion tbe
orowd wants to go.
This is tbe great reason why we need
not fear the results of the election to
day. As Republicans or Democrats we
may be disappointed, but as a whole,
people we shall not be disappointed.
The people will still rule. Either Mr*
Hughes or Mr. Wilson will necessarily
carry out the wishes of the majority of
the people as tbey find it expressed every
day in what we call public sentiment.
For tbe voter in this country does vote
every day of the year—and bis daily vote
js heeded by the executive, legislative
and judicial department of the govern
men£. Any other course by these officers
would be a blunder. The most success
ful political administrations are those
who make the fewest blunders in the
reading of the pages of popular senti
mont.
No matter who is elected, the country
is safe. God and the people still rule.
