Captain Pika tueeaadt Kajar Lanza
Major Conrad. H. Lama, who has
been adjutant to the commanding
officer ever since Camp Darning was
instituted has boon ordered to El
Paso for duty in General Bell's ter
ritory. Major Lanza ia a marvel in
military service, because of hia ready
knowledge of details and hia com
maud of many languages. Doming
forced a great attachment for the
courteous and obliging officer and we
all deeply regret that hia expert sarv
icea are needed elsewhere.
In Major Lania's atead, however,
cornea a soldier and gentleman of
of superior attainments in the person
of Captain Bhepard L. Pike, of tho
18th Infantry, now at Douglas,
Captain Pike has been in the military
service since 1899 and baa been in
the Philppines twice and once in
Alaska.
He has previously served with Col,
Glenn and is a warm admirer of the
splendid ability of our very efficient
camp commander.

Luna County Does Not "Endorse"
When the news of Luna county's
vote waa received the Headlight staff,
so wo are informed, sent a wire to
President Wilson stating in substance
thnt Luna County endorsed his Mex
ican policy, by a vote of two to one.
While the Democratic party wn
triunphont in Luna count, "it doe.
not bv anv means indicate that we(
are in sympathy wifh any policy und
er which o bandit likj Pnncho Villa
could enter the contlncs of our peace
ful county like he did nt Cnlumbn
nnd kill fifteen irood American citi
zens nnd loot, burn and pillage, as he
did. And a little later, when we whis j
i'oniHlled to witness the hnnuintt ot
six of the murderer. It is not nt all
complimentary to onr splendid cit
izenship to say that we endorse or
even countenance such outrage.
Referring to tho Luna eimnty vote,
the F.1 Paso Herald says:
"The fact thnt Luna county, Xu
Mexico in which Columbus is Minut
ed, returned a voto of almost two to
one in favor of president Wilson, does
not prove the voter are in syvjpnthy
with the president's policies is respect
to Mexico, as a result ot which, the
Republican party has argued, the raid
of Villa on Columbus was made pos
sihle. Luna county people undoubt
edly deplore the attack on Columbus
as deeply as ever nnd they may feel
that a more vigorous course with re
spect to Mexico, pursued from the be
ginning would have prevened such an
Attack being made.
