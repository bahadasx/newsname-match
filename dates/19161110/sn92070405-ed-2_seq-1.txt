plete, mado Wilson reasonably certain
of 232 votes in the electoral collego
and seemed to give Hughes 218. Tlioro
were SI votes still in doubt, 2CC being

Early today returns from states listed
last night as doubtful indlcato that the
Democrats may retain their majority
In the House and Senate although In
tho lower branch of Congross the Re
publicans have made serious Inroads
an tho Democratic control. Tho Senate
memberships of the two parties may

Democrats.

Hughes.
Cheyenne, Wyo., Nov. 8 CWedncs-
day). Ono hundred and thirty-eight
precincts out of 588 give Wilson 5,270;
Hughes, 4,082. For United States sen
ator, 11G precincts give Kendrick,

I'HKKIDK.Vr.
Hughes carried New York by a plu
rality estimated at 120,000. Wilson
carried New York City by about 40,
000, but that was more than offset by
tho Hughes votes upstato. The re
turns outside of New York City are in
complete,' but they indicate an upstate
Vlurality of 100,000 for Hughes.
Illinois has gone to Hughes by a plu
rality that may approximate Roose
velt's record of 304,000 in 1904.
Southern Illinois, the Republican cit
adel, was solid for the Hughos elect
ors. President Wilson made no gains
lnany of tho downstate oxcopt for a
small increase around Contralla, where
William Jennings Brynn made a per
sonal appeal to boyhood friends.
Ohio, according to the early returns,
had been carried by Wilson by a tre
mendous plurality. Later the figures
favorable to tho President wore con
siderably reduced and the Republican
managers asserted tho state would bo
found eventually to have gone for
Hughes by 20,000.
Unless, however, the vote in tho ru
ral districts which has not been re
ported should prove overwhelming for
Hughes, Ohio must be conceded to the
President.
' Hughes developed a strong lead In
West Virginia which, it sustained by
succeeding returns, will give him tho
state by a small margin.
Kansas was in doubt, according to

Lusk, Wyo. J. M. Pease killed his
daughter-in-law, Mrs. Albert Pike, and
gave himself up to the Bherlff. Pease
told Mrs. Pike that he intended to kill
hor and drew a revolver. His wife
pleaded with him not to shoot, but he
shouted, "I Intend to get you ail," and
opened fire. As Mrs. Pike fell he
turned the gun on other members of
his family, but at that Instant neigh
bors appeared and he desisted, later
surrendering.
the early returns, Wilson making a
big showing in the cities. When the
country districts were heard from,
however, Hughes assumed the lead,
and tho indications are that he has
carried the state.
The President ran well in San Fran
cisco, but Hughes carried Los Angeles
pountv by 25.000. and probably has
,v,on the thirteen electoral votes of
California.
Thore seems to bo little doubt that
Utah, Nevada and Montana have been
carried by Wilson. New Mexico, which
ithe Republicans had counted upon,
. nnnears to have Kono Democratic.
The Republican hooos of carrying
Kentucky received a decided setback
and all the indications now point to
a Wilson victory in the stato.
In Maryland the outcome Is in

McCormlck Claims Wilson's Election
New York, Nov. 8. Vance McCop
mlck, chairman of tho Democratic na
tlonal committee, at midnight claimed

270 electoral votes, not including Mas
sachusetts and Connecticut or Cali
fornia and other far Western Btaiei
yet to be heard from."

doubly thankful as an American for
the election of Mr. Hughes. It is a vln
dlcatlon of our national honor. Be
cause of some charges that havo been
made I wish to state now that I will
not under any circumstances make

Santa Fd. Only ono in every forty
acres in Now Mexico is undor cultiva
tion and only ono in overy 130 acres

letln of the United States geological
survey, Just Issued. This bullotln
says:
"Of the 78,485,700 acres ot New
Mexico nearly halt is public land and
14,000,000 acres stato land. Ranches
cover 12,000,000 acres, somewhat less
than 2,000,000 1b cultivated and less
than 600,000 is irrigated. Of tho irri
gated area, 200,000 acres belong to in
dividuals or partnerships, 60,000 acros
to commercial organizations, 300,000
acros to co operativo or community or
ganizations, and 30,000 acres to In
dians. Tho remainder is irrigated un
der government reclamation and tho
area so served will bo considerably
Increased when tho lands below tho
Elophant Dutto dam are utilized.
'One ot the greatest mineral re
sources of New Mexico Is coal, which
occurs in tho largo fields west of Ra
ton, at places near Cerrillos, about
Gallup, and In several other areas
Thero aro also valuable mines of gold,
coppor, sliver, lead and zinc. The to
tal production of these metals In 1915,
according to the U. S. geological sur
voy, department of tho interior, had
a value of $19,275,408, of which $13,'
