UNOFFICIAL ELECTION RETURNS
For Carbon County, Election November. 7 19-6.
Ik-low arc the unofficial election returrm for Carbon county for the general election of Tuex
day, November 7, 1916. They ure Kathcrctl nnd compiled by The Sun from its own corresnonfl
ents as well as bciiiK compared with tho.se received nt republican county headquarters nt Price,
and are believed to be about correct. Next week, however, The Sun will give tho official count
b,y the board of county comminnloncrA, who meet next Mondny to canvass the vote.
The Hocinlittt-liibor and prohibition vote in Carbon county is this week purposely omitted be
cause of scattering returns sent in. The votes for candidates on theso tickets will be Riven in the
official canvass. Also the vote on the two proposed constitutional amendments and of the so
cialists. The vote of Peter Anderson, socialist candidnte for sheriff, is the only one on that ticket
received complete by The Sun.
Tiie two proX)sed constitutional amendments are overwhelmingly defeated in Carbon county
as well as in the state.

ANOTHER FOUR YEARS
OF WOODROW WILSON
Utah and the Nation Each B
Are Safely In the Fold H
of Democracy. flfl
CARBON COUNTY TAKEN OVER BY BOURBONS H
NEW YOKK, Nov. 9. Tho jtatca of Cnllfornla, New Mexico H
nnd North Dakota swinging into tho democratic column nt mid- , 1
night tonight made certain thefre-elecUbn of Woodrow Wilson over H
Chnrles Kvans Hughes with ntjeiwt'six clectornf voles to spare. - H
The states of Minnesota nnd New Hnmpshirc remained doubtful H
with n strong trend townrd the democratic enndidntc. Republican : JH
lenders nt national hcndiiunrters last night nnd early this mom- jJ
ing refused to surrender the last hope of Hughes' election. , HH
The hardest blow to their hopes came when news was received J
thnt nn alleged transposition of two thousand votes from Wilson H
to Hughes in California had been discovered, nnd thnt thu corrcc- , H
tion gave the president a plurality of about thirty-five hundred. j jH
Wilson lias certainly enrried thirty-one Northern, Southern nnd j H
Western states, with 272 electoral votes. Hughes carried fourteen H
Enstern nnd Northern states nnd two Western states, with nn '
electoral vote of 2-13.
ELECTION SETTLED BY CALIFORNIA. M
California, which had wavered for two days between Wilson
nnd Hughes, settled all doubt as to the outcomu of the election nt H
10 o'clock tonight, when the lend of the president was increased '
so thnt with but sixty-five districts missing his plurality wns .1112.
In New Mexico he took the lend from Hughes nnd wns 2G3-1 votes
nhend, with a hundred nnd fifty-eight districts unreported. At tho S
rame time North Dakota became sure for Wilson nnd Wilson gains I il
were reported In West Virginia,-Minnesota nnd New Hnmpshirc. , H
When the news of California's decision reached republican t
head(unrters in New York the place was almost instantly de- jH
t cried. There is still talk of making contests, nnd many lawyers, HH
headed by former Attorney General George W. Wickersliam, have"
been engaged to take all possible legal steps to fight for Hughes ,ifl
to the last trench. ijjl
LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN RECOUNTS. rH
So decided, however, were tho midnight returns thnt none of liI
the republican leaders hnd any confidence thnt cither recounts Tl
or recourse to courts could save thclrcnndldntc. The result of the VM
election, which was clouded by doubt nnd conflicting reports for jl
two days, hits upset nil precedents in Amcrlcnn politics. Wilson afl
has been elected by republican states states on which the repub- HHI
lienn party leaders counted so surely that they took little trouble Pl
or expense to mnke pre-election fights within their borders. Jilfll
Without New York or Illinois, which declared decisively for 1H
Hughes, the democrats found enough strength in the middle nnd 'TM
extreme West to overcome the great electoral votes of these nnd liil
many other populous nnd important states. Of the Western States, liH
where a Hughes victory wns practically conceded by the demo- fnl
crats, Hughes wits victorious only in Oregon. In tho Middle West, ' lH
Iown nnd South Dakota only votod for him. New England's rock- IH
ribbed republicanism almost cracked under the strain of the trend iHI
toward Wilson. Republican pluralities of former years dwindled IKH
until they almost disappeared. In the case of New Hnmpshirc it H
will require nn offlcinl count to decide the claim of the republicans ' 2llH
thnt their hold upon n solid Now Englnnd is still unbroken. The ' rHH
result in New Englnnd is a savuge blow nt the confidence of the LiH
high protectionists thnt the tnriff will be n continuing issue in rlll
American politics. t B
There is no evidence in nn analysis of the vote in New Englnnd J HH
thnt the tnriff wns even considered by the voters. 3'fll
INSULT TO AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE. IH
Conceding West Virginia, New Hampshire nnd Minnesota to !' iflifl
Hughes nnd he wns in the lend in nil three only gives him two DtiiH
hundred nnd fifty-nine votes, seven less than the required mn- pi BKI
Jority. With two hundred ijnd seventy-two votes in sight Prcsl- IF Hfl
dent Wilson hnd six to spare for n possible split of electors in SliiH
California or n sudden reversnl in New Mexico. At republican 11 H
headquarters it was ndmitted that nfter conference between G. W. HiHkH
Wickershnm. former attorney general of tho United States; Ever- l HH
ett Colby of New Jersey, C. E. Hughes, Chairman Wlllcox nnd M H
George W. Perkins of Baltimore preparations were being made to StilKSH
begin legal proceedings for recounts in states where thu results rj HfiH
were close. Chairman Willcox included California, New Mexico, f iH
North Dakotn, New Hampshire nnd Minnesota in his list of stntes h H
where recounts undoubtedly would be demanded. I: H
PREPARED, HOWEVER, FOR FIGHT, ; tMM
Democratic headquarters arc not behind the republicans in L BH
preparing for legal developments. Chairman McCormlck confer- f BH
red with Alton B. Parker, former democratic candidate for presi- ,i H
dent; Morgan J. O'Brien, Delancey Nlcoll and John B. Stanchfield, PH
all prominent New York lawyers. It was evident that If the elee- j ' BH
tion was to be take.i into the courts the legal giants of both par- ; i H
ties were being marshalled for such a battle royal as the United 1 1
States never has seen. i'lH
In an official statement thu democratic national committee iiflH
claimed two hundred nnd seventy-two votes for President Wilson tftfiH
nnd a popular plurality of two to three hundred thousand, fliH
"To say there will be any contest," declnred the statement, "is l&flH
Iun insult to the intelligence of the American people." lilHliH
