The sudden switch '61 New Hampshire
from a small Hughes plurality |
to 93 votes for Wilson "was the dramatic
change ip the situation this morn'

the Secretary of State that a partial
official count in all the districts disclosed
errors in calculations by town
and ward clerks. The official count is
still progressing. j

, The Division of Supplies is now one
I of the efficiently organized forces of
i the Post Office department. It was not
j so, however, until the advent of this
' Administration, when the management
! of this particular branch of the service
passed into the hands of the present
1? Ji.rtn Assistant Postmast; r General,
of whose bureau this division is
an -""nportant part. It deals directly i
with the postmasters throughout the'
country, and its duties are to see that i
they are properly and promptly supplied
with the means of conducting the
public business, the blanks, books,:
forms, and various supplies which the;
service requires.
The 55,000 post offices in the United t
States naturally require an enormous ,
amount of supplies with which to con- j
duct <the business of the Government, j
For instance, there will be required1
this year for the service 680,000 miles i
of twine, weighing 2,000,000 pounds, j
enough to encircle the globe 27 times
and which would fill 60 big freight j
cars; 15.000 gallons of ink and muci
lage; more than a billion facing slips;
. and all otfier forms of supplies in cor1
responding magnitude. This division
alone lias supplies in transit every i
working day of the year, practically!
all postal supplies being now sent by
freight, at an annual sa\ring of ap-!
proximately a quarter of a million dol- !
lars. When it is considered that the
purchase, controi, and issue of all
i these supplies is centered in the De- j

' effective supervision which such a vast
business demands, in order that ju-l
: dicious economy may be considered in
contract and purchase and discoverable
waste checked in issue, it will
; be seen that, properly interpreted, this
; means unremitting attention and v:igi-!
lance oil every hand, so that all pos-:
sible benefits be secured from these;
wise and necessary provisions.
Wasteful ExtraTaarance Checked. i
Under the old custom wfiich years of ;
precedent had firmly established, it
was the practice to honor all requi-'
sitions tor supplies irrespective or,
character or amount. The consequence
was that th-^ government was annual-:
ly put to an expense exceeding by many
thousands of dollars the amount actually
needed for the uses of the service.
This practice and the loose
methods of business management
which were a part of this old system,
w re severely condemned in a report
made by an expert committee appointed
by congress ior the purpose of inquiring
into departmental methods
and procedure. Frequent changes of
administrative heads and general disinclination
to make t^e radical changes
required resulted in nothing "being
don?, and things tt<ere allowed to drift
along and conditio? s to remain just
as before.
The waste in the u of supplies thus i
liberally furnished, is not the only
item of expense whI thes? methods
entailed. Absence of v .roper oversight
into rhe details governing the business
permitted a force of clerks to remain
upon thi3 work w'aose .-v-rvices coma
have been more usefully employed
elsewhere or discontinued altogetii'-r.
All this, together with the inappropriate
and unsuitable system in operation,
led t.o a mass of unnecessary
correspondence, in winch the complaints
of postmasters it protracted
delay and errors in fil ing requisitions
formed a considerable p.Tt, and which
a better system and wiser management
could "have measurably ssened, if
1 not entirely abolbhcd. Numerous
; changes in the method of operation
1 were accordingly made, . areful scru!
tiny of requisitions required, as well
| as all requests for monetary ;.!iowj
ances w,th the result t?:-at very con
siderable economies wer? entc:e? m
j time, labor, and expense.
Mfrisnres of Economy Adapted.
Another discover, d nepd for which a
! remedy was promptly applied, was a
revision of the specifications under
which bianks. books, etc., for the monr*
order service werp furnished'. By
this revision a reduction of practically
one-third of the blanks formerly
under contract has been accomplished.
Careful study of the amount needi
ed during: a contract period resulted
i in greatiy reduced bids being made
| possible by furnishing contractors
j with true estimates of th actual
\ quantities required, the amount so
'saved for the four-year period begin-j
j ning December 1. 1915, being approx-!
I imat;ly $13-0.000. 1
! There is also another matter of con[
sHprable expense to the department
j which a wis^r policy has now greatly
lessened and will eventually altogether
abolish, viz. the practice of renting
the canceling machines used in the1
service. All such machines are to be
placed on a government-owned basis

water works bond
Editor Herald and News:.
i The city of Newberry for the purntwp
of in stalling an electric light
plant and a system of water works m
the year 1896, issued $42,000.00 of 6
per cent forty year bonds, maturing
in 1936. To insure the sale or these
bonds a clause was inserted in the
face of the bond pledging the city
council to pay to the commissioner^
of public works every year the sum
of $1050.00 to be invested in a sinking
fund for the redemption of said
bonds. But upon the expectation that
this yearly payment oi $1050.00 with
the annual interest UDon same would
in forty years amount to a sum large - i
ly in excess of $42,000.00, there was
added to the face of the bonds another
clause giving to the commissioners j
of public works the option of redeeming
any one or all or these bonds at
the expiration of twenty years. For
at the twenty year period it "was calculated
that the sinking fund would
amount to more than $30,000.00.
With this $30,000.00 on hand, then
an issue of $12,000.00 new' bonds tor
a ten year period at lower rate of J
interest, should enable the commis- j
sioners to retire the whole issue of j
$42,000.00 6 per cent, bonds, and with j
a continuation of the same sinking'
lund trrangt meqt, this new issue of)
$12,000.00 could be easily retired at!
the expiration of ten years. So that I
with the expiration of a 'thirty year i
period, the whole debt of $42,000.00 J
would be wiped out in thirty years, and
the city would own her electric light
plant and water works free of all encumbrances.
And the most important financial
matter for the tax-payer's consideration
at this time is the utilization of
this twenty year clause by the commissioners
of public works in the redeeming
of this issue of forty year
$42,000.00 bonds, one reason for which
is that the wiping out of $30,000.00
of the city's indebtedness would be
of ereat advantaee in more ways than
one in improving her financial rating.
And another is that if this option
is not taken advantage or the city
may not be able to make any settlement
with the bond-holder before the
expiration of the forty years, the lift
of the bonds, for with this sinking
und security there it not a better 6
per cent bond on the market and no
holder of a bond will be yilling to
give up his bond except at its full
VaiUe. Ill nve ^e<U"8 liujju tm? hujci j
if there is no use made of this option,
the sinking fund will have accummu- ,
lated a sufficient sum to retire tfifc
whole $42,000.00, and should the city
be forced to continue the present plan
until the expiration of the forty years,
cue sinking fund will have accumulated
a sum of approximately one hun- :
ured thousand dollars. The most careful
investment ahd management of :
this sum by the commissioners or pub
lie works will ent9.1l upon tne city a
less of several hundrtu dollars annually,
as they will be paying t> per ?
cent inUrest and making investment 1
at 4 per cent or 5 per cent, winch is 1
not a pleasanl outlook for the i
Taxpayer. i
owning 508 of these machines, and it ,
10 ovn^teH that at the end of this ,
4 O ?- ^
rental period, June 30, 1917, there ,
will be a sufficient number of these
government-owned machines to re- ,
place at least half of those under ren- ,
tal, thus allowing $15,000 for the pur- .
chase of new machines the following .
year and practically abolishing the ;
necessity for renting such machines
thereafter. At the present time the (
cost of these rented machines is $230,000
annually. i
Rt pairing scales returned from the
service as defective and damaged, has
also produced a considerable economy
in that direction, 2,737 of those returned
being put into good order during
the past year. As tne parcel
post uses a great number of scales
in the conduct of its business, u.0,iy<s |
o* the 100-pound capacity beam scale
having already been furnished, the
repair of such as can be made serviceable
again, instead of being condemned
and sold as waste material
along with others, as has been the
practice hentofere, represents quite
a saving at very small cost.
Careful Management in the Issue of
vSupplies.
The great number of requisitions annually
sent in from the post offices of
the country for the numerous articles
needed, amounting during the past
year to something like 500,000, demanded
svstem and method for sue
cessful operation. This was met by
the establishment of the central distributing
office plan which provides
offices selected with reference to their
railroad or other mail transportation
facilities for the territory to be supplied.
embracing several counties, and
to which the offices within this territory
were to be tributary. These

the campaign.
Some people bolt presidential convention,
others bolt meal, and a few
are in the business of bolt manufacturing.
But the best bolt for the energetic
candidates in the Herald and News
Corculation Campaign, is that from the
aloom and inactivity and doubt, into
Hie life of endeavor and success. Fail-,
r.re is always for those who wait and
dream and never act. It is only for |
those who are willing to accept it j
The candidates in this Campaign who
are taking advantage of the opor-j
tunities as they present themselves
will no doubt be the ones who will (
secure the larger awards on Dec- i
; mber 2nd. j
"The few candidates who took ad- j
vantagp of'past opportunities no doubt!
slept the sleep of the peaceful and
in bulk thus saving the long and expensive
mail hauis formerly neees-J
sary. These third and fourth class'
postmasters thus .deal directly with'
iiieir distrubting centi-rs instead of!
writing directly to the department forj,
= vei^ u miug uceu, duu cuej uiumari-[
ly receive their supplies within twen- j
ty-four hours, whereas by the old!
method, days and weeks were often!
necessary. Another advantage of this j;
system is til*3 supervision which these |
distributing offices can exercis-e over;
the character and amount of supplies J,
to be furnished. Being in close touch, |
any tendency to over stocking or j
waste, so common by the old method,
is easily checked and prevented. Dis-.
iributing offices have taken on their j
added duties without increased force, |
md reports from the service gener- j
ally indicate that the local supply i
i>oints are both popular and practi-1
cable. :
The inauguration of the new system
lias lessened the clerical force formerly
required and may be expected to
produce still further economies in
that direction. The orderly and systematic
method by which the stock
is now kept in the department and by
which articles- called for upon requisitions
can be readily assembled
and checked off, time saved, ana errors
avoided, is part of this system
and adds considerably to its general
success. The department is gratified
that present methods are so satisfactory,
that vexatious delays no longer
exist, but that all are striving earnestly
to do their part towards making1
their share of public duty acceptable
to the people whom th-y serve. j

Their failure last week to secure &

of the greatest admiration, and
they are putting forth every -effort

You now have the greatest and last

the remainder of the Campaign, if
you do not take advantage of this, and
advantage of the second voting period,
it will be as Napoleon once said,
"It wil be worse than an error. It lrlll

The proposition is be??re you, the
opportunity is yours, and it is up to
you to take advantage of it.
aosente landlord nor any real estate
speculator who does not actually
farm his own land may make nse of
it. Further-more, it limits the size of
the loan to $10,000, to prevent the use
of the money for the purpose of monopolizing
land. Every provision of
the bill is drawn in the* interest of the
fcirmor r\t mo/Unni.nivftH nnoMti/ina
who has heretofore suffered from restricted
credit. #
Under the Farm Ix)an Act farmers
or prospective farmers may borrow
up to 50 per cent of the value of their
land and 20 per cent of the value of
permanent insured improvements
thereon. If a renter wants to me
tais money to purchase a farm, he
must bargain for his land in advance
and tnen indicate m nis application
what land he expects to come into
possession of. He "will be required to
have in cash 50 per cent of the purchase
price, unless the man he buys
from is willing to take a second mortgage
on top of the Federal Land Bank
mortgage, it is predicted that this
practice will become popular, because
the Federal Land Bank mortgage
practically never comes due and
is constantly being reduced by annual
payments.?Frank R. Wilson, in
