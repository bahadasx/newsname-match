If the "bone dry amendment ear
riea in the state, as appears not im
probable, the law will become oper

preme court has ruled that meas
ures adopted by the dchdio nnlnan
otherwise peclficallv Drovldinv for
a date upon which they become op
erative, go into effect as soon as pass,
ed. However, It is probable that ship
ments of liquor can be received up
until the time that the wi-Min, nf
tate formally announces the passage
or the measure. This will be several
days, doubtless. The amendment
provides that no liquor of anv kind
can be shipped into the state for bev.
erage purposes At present the law
permits two quarts of liauor or !
