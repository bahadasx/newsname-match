RECOUNT OF VOTE IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE.

count of the vote for presidential

ELECTION IN TAZEWELL QUIET.
The election in Tnzewell county
passed off quietly. The weather wus
idoal and enthusiasm ran high all ov?
er the district, and a heavy vote was
polled. As usual, both pides claimed
the election up to a late hour in the
afternoon.
A telegram received from Mr. Cald
well, Mr. Trinkle's mannger, late on
Tuesday afternoon, which stated that
Trinkle was carrying everything over
on the main line, and Democrats here
were encouraged, and confidently pre?
dicted Slemp'a defeat. The Republi?
cans, however, as a rule, never had
a doubt of Trinkle's defent. There
was a large crowd in town, but no dis
order whatsoever or confusion.
At The New Theater.
As advertised, arrangements were
made to get the returns at the New
Theater, and show the figures on the
screen. A large crowd filled the build?
ing, many lndis and young people
being among the numncr. Several fine
reels of pictures were shown, and be?
tween thnes the election returns,
many of which proved to be incorrect,
and so it hns been ever since as re?
gards the National ticket At this
writing, Thursdny noon, the result is
still in doubt, both sides claiming a
majority in the electoral college. The
papers yesterday morning stated that
both President Wilson and Hughes
were still confident of election.
An official count may be necessary
to determine the result.

bull will make your calves worth $5.00
to $10 more per head.
The man without a farm, but who
has one or two grade jerseys or
shorthorns for milk production?
1. Because the services of a good
beef bull will make his calves worth
$10 or more per head than if sired
by n scrub jersey.

sey calves in Tnzewell county, but a

the selling price per pound he receives
for the finished product without in?
creasing the cost of production.

beef type will put on more gain for
the same cost than the scrub.

GINIA, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER,
Success in Effort to Improve the Live
Stock of the County.
Only n small portion of the county
has been canvassed, but up to the
4th inst., $2425.00 hnd been subscrib?

in order that the Association accom?

TRIUNE IMMERSION.
Episcopal Minister Administers Ordi?
nance After Ancient Custom.
An unusual religious ceremony wns
performed here on Wednesday after?
noon in the Baptist church, the only
one of the kind, perhaps, ever per?
formed in Southwest Virginia, cer-1
tainly within recent years.
Rev. Mr. Rich, Episopal minister,
baptized one Mr. Smith, of Bluefield,
three times, face foremost, in the bap?
tistry, in the Baptist church. This
form of baptism is practiced by the
denomination known as Dunkards, a
numerous nnd highly respected de?
nomination of Christians in the Unit?
ed States, but that the Episcopalians
or uny other denomination than the
Dunkard9 observed the rite in this
form, is not generally known in this
section. |
Arch Deacon Rich informs the writ?
er, however, that this form of triune
immersion, while not a doctrinal re?
quirement, hns been the custom in the
Episocpal church for ages; whether
the ordinance is performed by sprink?
ling, pouring or immersion in the
nnme of the Father, onco in the name
of the son, and once in the name of
the Holy Ghost. The service was sol?
emn and impressive., nnd hnd the ser
vico been advertised nnd known there
would have no doubt been a large
crowd present.
Bishop Tucker and Arch Deacon
j Rich, reached Tnzewell by automobile
no Wednesday afternoon, accompan?
ied by the candidate, Mr. Smith, and
Mr. Fowler and a lady, about 5 p. m.
' All preparations had been made for
! the baptism, which was performed
nbout 6:30. Bishop Tucker and Mr.
Rich conducted service in Straa Mem
orinl in tlic evening, the Bishop de
llvoring O line .sermon to U large au
dioncc.
While here the ministers were the
guests of Judge and Mrs. S. C. Gra?

BLUE RIBBON PIGS.
Mr. Harry Huston butchered two
pigs last week that weighed -W.l lbs.
The pigs were seven months and 2t)
days old, and two months old when
he bought them?Duroc und Poland
China crossed. One weighed 250 and
2113. The pigB weighed, at a guess,
between -15 nnd 50 pounds. So, it
would appear that about 200 lbs. fat
was put on them during the 220 days
(about) in which they were fed. They
were fattened on chop almost entire?

OUR LIBRARY.
Now, that long winter evenings nre
with us, what can make the time pass
more profitably and pleasantly than
a good book. As dimming says:
"Nothing can supply the place of
books. They arc cheering or sooth?
ing companions in solitude, idleness
or affection. Tho wealth of both con?
tinents would not compensate for the
good they impnrt. Let every one if
possible gnther some good books un?
der his roof nnd obtain access for hlm
I sol/ and family to some social libra?
ry. Almost any luxury should be sac?
rificed for this."

PLANS MADE TO BUILD CHILD?
REN'S HOSPITAL.
The Virginia Anti-Tuberculosis As?
sociation hna issued the following:
Plans were determined upon at a
meeting of the Board of Directors of
the Virginia Anti-Tuberculosis Asso?
ciation hold this week to co-operate
with the Cutawbn Teachers' Associa?
tion lo raise funds for a hospital for
crippled children. The need for such
a hospital has been much discussed by
the Tuberculosis Association and it
had been determined to do (his piece
of work as soon as the uugro sanitar?
ium, in which the Association took so
active an interest, had been provided
for.
"It. is time wo did something for our
crippled children," said Captain W. W.
Baker, President, of the Virginia Anti
Tuberculosis Association. "Four hun?
dred and twolya children under llftoen
years of ago died ill Virginia from tu?
berculosis ill 1014. Mnny.'of them died
of tuberculosis of tile* bone. Many
others linvo the disease, and no pro?
vision hns been made for their treat?
ment. Tin re is no special hospital
or ward in the Stale for these children.
The general hospitals lake them in
limited numbers, but the long period
of treatment necessary makes it al?
most essential that special provision
should be made for them. Many of
those children, if treated early would
become self supporting citizens and
would have practically I heir full op?
portunity for happiness and service."
It is planned to use a portion of the
funds procured by the salo of Red
Cross Christmas Seals for this objoct.
The proceeds from the seals were lin?
ed in the same manner lo further the
cause of the Negro Santiorium. The
full plans for the .children's tin nil nr
ium have not been worked out, but a
special committee bus already been
appointed consisting of Dr. Ennion
G. Williams, Dr. W. M. Graham, of
Richmond, Dr. Charles Crandy, of
Norfolk, and MisH Agnes 1). Randolph,
executive secretary of the Virginia
Anti-Tuberculosis Association.
35,000 CASES IN VIRGINIA.
A recent bulletin sent out by the
Anti-Tuberculosis Association of Vir?
ginia, states that there arc 35,000 cas?
es of tuberculosis in Virginia.
There are, all told, only about 250
beds in the Sanitariums in the State,
including Catawba, and private sani?
tariums in the city of Richmond, with
35 bods, Danville, 20 beds; Salem, 2?;
and Catawba, with about 170 beds. It
will be seen at a glance that provis?
ion for caring for these unfortunates
is entirely inadequate. Consider these
facts as brought out by the report of
tho Tuebrculosis Commission of Vir?
ginia, 1015, printed and circulatd by
order of the Governor. "More than
twice as many persons died in Virgin?
ia in 1014 from tuberculosis * * *
than from all the seven most fatal dis?
eases combined?typhoid fever, small
pox, mensles, scarlet fever, diptheria,
whooping cough and malaria." The
abovo named diseases caused all to?
gether 1.820 deaths; tuberculosis caus?
ed 3,727 deaths, more than twice as
mnny. One person out of every eight
who died in Virginia during the yeur
1014 died of tuberculosis.
The death rate among the negroes
of the State is much higher than
among the whites. Of the deaths
among the colored people thirty-six
per cent of those who died wero do?
mestics, working in the families of
white people.
So, from u purely selfish point of
view, nctive steps should bo taken to
at least prevent the spread of tho dis
ense. The disease is not hereditary,
but communicated from infected ens
os. If there are 85,000 cases, and this
is regarded as a conservative esti?
mate, which was made ao of tho fig
{ urcs of two years ago, and the disease
is not decreasing in number. At
Catawba, there ore only 109 beds, so it
can bo seen nt a glance that Tazewell
county needs n sanitarium right hero.
Active steps are to bo taken at once
to arouse the people on the crying
and pressing need of another and a
Inrgcr hospital in Southwest Virginia
for the care and cure of tho unfortu?
nate people who hove the dreaded dis
. case and to prevent its further spread,
