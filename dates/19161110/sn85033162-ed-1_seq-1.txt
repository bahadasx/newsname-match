matt room of the I. o. O. F. Hall. One

Al this writing the result of the
Vrwldentlal election Is still 'In doubt.
The odds seem to be In favor of Mr.
Hughes. No election In the United
'States has ever been held where so
runny votes were cast and where the
-v-andldatei have run so evenly to
gether. In some oft he states the
voles were only a few hundred In dif
ference. This evenly balanced nun
ber of the parties is a good thing for
Vhe country because the party In pow-
wr will Te put upon Its good behavior

' more efficient and better govern
ment Parties being long In power
"beeomo corrupt and arrogant and for
that reason the people change them.
