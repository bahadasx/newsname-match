NEW YORK, Nov. 10.—Amer
ica has chosen Woodrow Wllsin
president and Thomas R. Marshall
vice president lor four years
more, on the face of returns avail
able early today.
There was only the barest pos
sibility that recounts and possible
ccurt contests predicted by un
yielding republicans would change
tho situation.
Wilson's lead ln California was
so commanding that it appeared
that no matter what the result ln(
the few remaining precincts he
would have a clear plurality.
20» to 248 Now.
Counting California's entire
rote for Wilson, his total in the
electoral college — disregarding
states in which there still remain
ed a doubt as to the outcome—
appeared today to reach _«9—
three more than necessary.
Three states were still in doubt
— Minnesota, New Mexico and
New Hampshire—but their total
electoral vote of 19 would not be
sufficient to elect Hughes unless
the republican nominee gained
more than four of California's
votes on a split ln that state.
a aqueak, and even at that I hsar
folk that voted for him aaying
they hope he has learned a lot
.since school let out.
One thing he might learn is
that, after all, there ir.n't very
much in this world to be afraid
of.
A man might very well be
afraid of stumbling out of the
good straight road, or be afraid
of the weak spots in his own cha.--!
acter.
But the very last thing to be
afraid of is a collection of men
with their hands full of kale,
mostly swiped from other people.
Those of us that have had a
chance to watch Prof. Wilson at
short range know well enough
that more than once he has been
scared by that apparition.
GREAT TO BE
A WESTERNER!
__ j
Isn't it great to be a westerner? Because for
once tlie far west has dictated who shall be
president.
With the east and south deadlocked, came the
western slope's opportunity. And as a result
we are going to have an administration which
shall derive much of its inspiration from the
progressive, feai'less, free-minded west.
It won't do the east a bit of harm to learn for
once that it does not constitute the entire United
States.
As the result stands today, Connecticut, Dela
ware, Illinois, lowa, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvan
ia, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont,
West Virginia and Wisconsin were lined up
for Hughes. The only far western state certain
for him is Oregon, with'five electoral votes.
Isn't it great to be a westerner?

JOHNSON
SLIGHT IS

II nliiil I'rt-*.- I .fit-ted Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10. —
Gov. Hiram Johnson, in his can
didacy for U. S. senator, ran near
ly 300,000 ahead of Charles
Evans Hughes for president, in
complete unofficial returns from
all sections of California showed
today.
While Hughes was running a
few thousand votes behind Presi
dent Wilson, Johnson, running on
the same republican ticket, was
burying his democratic opponent,
George S. Patton, under a verita
ble avalanche of votes.
In discussing this situation to
day, one newspaper declares that
Hughes lost because he ignored
Gov. Johnson when the latter
made his famous campaign trip
to this state several months ago.
Didn't Even Meet.
At that time, it is pointed out,
the state primaries had not been
held and Johnson was fighting for
the republican senatorial nomina
tion.
Tho republican state central
committee, which was frankly
supporting Willis Booth, John
son's opponent, took Hughes in
charge.
Everywhere he went, Hughes
was attended by William H.
Crocker and other anti-Johnson
I men. At Long Beach, where
Hughes spent a day, Johnson was
In the same hotel vlth the presi
dential candidate but they did
not-meet.
Then came the primaries and
Johnson's sweeping nomination.
The state republican committee
was reorganized by the John sop
ites. Francis V. Keesllng, state
chairman, was ousted and Chester
Rowell -was put in his place.
Normally California Is -strong

WITHOUT
BOSSES

NEW YORK, Xov. JO. —
Woodrow Wilson apparently
has been elected president
without the votes of the here
tofore supposedly indispen
sable states of New York, In
diana and Illinois.
He has seemingly won without
aid from three democratic lead
ers whose domination in those
states is popularly acredlted them
in the title of "boss"—Charles F.
Murphy of Tammany Hall, Tom
Taggart of Indiana and Roger
Sullivan of Illinois.
Only two other presidents have
been elected without the vote of
New York. One was Grant, in
1868. The other was Ruther
ford B. Hayes.
Politicians all over the country
will await with interest the id
ministration's treatment of the
New York City, Illinois state and
Indiana state democratic organi
zations.
.^The consensus of opinion today
was that there were lean years
ahead for all three, so fur as fed
eral patronage and recognition hy
tho administration is concerned.
It is generally believed that on
Tammany Hall will fall Ihe hard
est blow—since from dawn of
election day the president's
friends had a hunch that the Mur
phyites would knife Wilson. The
tremendous city majority which
Tammany promised Wilson failed
dismally to materialize.

(l til It'll PMHM I e-ii'iel Wlrr.)
NEW YORK, Nov. 10. — Tha
political complexion of the com
ing house of representatives to
day remained in doubt with indi
cations that the lower body might
find itself with the balance of
power In the hands of several
members from without the major
parties—socialists, an independ
ent, a progressive and a protec
tionist.

Jeanetto Rankin of .Missoula,

a commanding lead over Harry

nent.
The Lineup Xow.
Following is the next house
lineup on returns gathered by the
United Press up to noon today:
Republicans, 216.
Democrats, 214.
Independents, 5.
The present house make-up is:
Democrats, 229.
Republicans, 197.
Progressives, C.
Independents, 1.
Socialists, 1.
Need SlB Votes.
A majority In the house is 218.
It takes thnt many votes, there
fore, to elect a speaker or to en
act legislation.
Either big party, therefore,
must, get the good will of tho-se
five men who are aligned with
smaller parties before It can do;
business in its own way.
And. incidentally, these five in-,
dependents will be no more marks
than will the "first woman in the I
world" to be seated at Washing-j
ton.
Miss Rankin was chosen on the :
republican ticket, but democrats'
point out that "she's a woman'
nevertheless."
Call 'Em the Balkans
The five men who on present
appearances, will be the balance |
of power or the "Balkans of tho!
house" as It was termed here to-'
day—are:
C. H. Randall, prohibitionist,
California.
W. P. Martin, protectionist,
Louisiana.
Meyer London, socialist, New
York.
Thomas V. Schall, progressive, j
Minnesota.
A. J. Fuller, independent,
Massachusetts.
Randall has had a rather hy
brid political career. He has
been a republican, progressive and
a democrat.
He ran on a prohibition ticket
Tuesday with the democratic sn
dorsement.
London's Lead Small.
Martin is the first man not a
democrat to be elected In Louis
iana in 26 years. He is described
as being basically a democrat with
a strong dash of protection.
Meyer London had a bitter
fight and was re-elected by less
than 200 votes.
Schall is an "unreconstructed
rebel," as the dyed-ln-the-wool
refuse-to-die progressives call >
themselves. He can be counted on '
to favor only the party that puts
up what he thinks is the p"*«l >- '
grcssive legislation and the best
man for speaker.
