What Looked Like Hughes
Victory Thursday Night
Changes to Wilson.
The last dispatch. Ipr'Klaij IllOrill HQ 1
just as we go to press tor the citv
delivery, states that California, the
deciding factor, has gone to Wilson,
which gives him 269 electoral votes
and the election.
Anxious moments these have been
for the past forty-eight hours, and at
the time of writing this story (Thurs
day afternoon) the suspense of
"Watchful Waiting" has not been re
lieved. The morning reports give
Wilson 251 electoral votes with Cali
fornia, North Dakota and Minnesota
still in doubt. It takes 2C6 electoral
votes to win. If Wilson holds all that
are now credited to him, he will need
15 more to win. Minnesota would
give him just the requisite number, or
California and North Dakota com
bined would do it. On the other hand
Hughes can win with any two of
these three states. So at this time
everybody is still "Up in the air" and
it may be owing to the uncertainty
and the closeness of the race that it
will take several days to definitely
ietermine the outcome.
The early telegraphic returns of
election night looked like a landslide
for Hughes. All the Northern states
oxcept Ohio were safely in the Hughes
column. The Southern states were
of course conceded to Wilson, and
meager returns from the Western
ind Pacific stat(s at 2:00 A. M. in
dicated that Hughes would carry a
majority of those states. The returns
were received by special wire at the
Maple City club rooms, and read as
fast a.- received to the hugh audience
that crowded the rooms. The demo
crats quit the game tarly, feeling that
it was a lest cause, and when the last
bulletin was received at 2:00 A. M.
all went home sure of a Hughes vic
tory. The republican enthusiasm was
increased on receipt of the morning
dailies, all of whom conceded the elect
ion to Hughes. Hut what a di!!Vr-
nr.- a few hours can make. Before
noon Western union dispatches wore
being flashed over the country that
practically all of the West had gone
tor Wilson and the result was in doubt
Telegraph and telephone wires all
over the countiy were literally burned
up in an effort to get the exact facts.
Wednesday night it had simmered
down to a position where the com
plete returns from Minnesota would
tell the story. Up to that time, re
turns from over half of the state gave
Wilson a majority there of 8,000.
Later a message was flashed that
Hughe- had carried the state, which
gave him the election. It was
simply a flash however, for on
Thursday morning the "Dope" was
again all upset by the uncertainty of
California, North Dakota and Min
nesota as already related in thi
story.
There was never any doubt from
the start in regard to Michigan. It
went all republican by approximately
)0,000 majority. In face of the cam
paign that had been waged against
Albert K. Sleeper, his victoiy was a
magnificent one, and it is a splendid
tribute to the grand man that he is.
No citizen of the state will ever have
cause to regret his election.
It had been quite generally predict
ed that Michigan would return a
"Dry" victoiy on the Prohibition
'imendment, and likewise defeat the
Home Rule amendment, Rut even the
most sanguine "Dry" supporter did
not dare predict the overwhelming
majority returned. The late figures
-how that the Prohibition amendment
carried the state by upwards of 70,000
and the Home Rule amendment was
defeated by nearly the same vote.
The most surprising part of the vote
on the mjaitloil was the "Dry" major
ities returned in the notoriously "Wet'
counties. The saloon is simply doom
ed, not only in Michigan, but through
out the whole United States, and God
.Speed the dav.

REPUBLICANS AND DRYS WIN
Sweeping Victory on Liquor
Question. County Ticket
Elected as Usual.
m
Election morning opened bright and
warm as spring time. "A regular
Republican day" was the frequent
comment on the street during the day.
This prediction proved true as far as
Van liuren county and the state were
Concerned, but there must have been
some mighty inclement weather in,
some of the states, according to the
late returns. As a result of the
splendid day, and the unusual interest
in the election, a heavy vote was poll
ed throughout thCL county. Taw Paw
polled nearly seven hundred votes, and
owing to the many amendments which
necessitated consider able time in the
booths, it was feared for a time that
it would be unpossible for every one
t cast their oallot before 5:00 oclock
the time of closing. Owing to the
i fnciency of the election board how
ever, and the effort on the part of
party workers to get the vote in early
everyone had an opportunity to get in
the booth on time. Another instance
of the erticiency of the election board,
was in the counting of the vote. The
entire vote, amendments and all were
tabulated and recorded by 10:00
o'clock. This we believe is a record.
The county all went safely republic
an. The tabulated report on this
page tells the story. (leorge Dillen
beck for Road Commissioner had a
close shave, but weal he red the storm.
None of the majorities are as high as
ti t y have been in former years, but
the unusual conditions, and bard cam-
paign on National Issues is probably
the cause. We will not attempt in
this story to give any of the major
ities, as considerable time has been
spent on the tabulation, which gives
the vote in detail.
The Prohibition and Home Rule
amendment created as much or more
interest in the campaign than Nation
al and State issues. A vigorous cam
paign had been waged for weeks by
the "Drys" the result of which show
ed In the ii;agnifici(. :it majority rolled
up in this county. Considerable fear
had been expressed that the similarity
of amendment balloti and the fact
that one must be voted Yes and the
other No, t cast a perfectly "Dry"
vote, would result in much confusion
and perhaps disaster. The result
showed however that the votes were
thoroughly familiar with the propo
sition and knew how to vote intelli
gently. The vote against the Home
Rule Amendment ran neck and neck
with the vote for State Wide Prohi
bition in this county. The "Dry"
forces had done their work well.
A fear also had been expressed by
republicans that the appeal of the
democratic candidate for (lovernor for
"Dry" votes would cut down Mr.
Sleeper's majority in the county. Hut
the claims of Mr. Sweet did not seem
to appeal very strongly to the repub
lican voters, for the tabulation will
show that Mr. Sleeper ran well up
w ith his ticket.
Taking everything into considera
tion, the vote in Van Ruren county
was highly satisfactory from a re
publican standpoint, and also from a
Standpoint of morality and good citi
zenship on the liquor issues.
