Other Results.
(By Associated Press;
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.?Chairman
Wlllcox refusing to concede the eleo
jtlon ot President Wllecm said today
f In formal statement, Issued after a
conference with othor Republican
managers, that tho result still depends
on the vote of a few close states and
| that the returns thus far announced
are In most states unofficial and may
be changed by the officials count.
Mr. Wilcox stated however that the
national committees would abide by
the decision of the official count unless
r special circumstances arose which
f'made other action necessary.
Thffs was the important developfoment
In the presidential election sit9
nation np to one p. m. today. Returns
continued to filter In from statos
S Which had been close but they made
no change In figures which gave Pros
| dent Wilson 269 electoral votes and
I Mr. Hughes 243.
Minnesota and New Mexico and New
Hampshire remained in doubt.
Minnesota's late return showed |
Hughes leading by 752 hut figures from |
New Hntnpshiro put Wilson ahead liv)
239 with eleven precincts missing,!
while he also leads in New Mexico.
At Democratic national hendquarters
the view is taken that the election
Is all over.

He was apparently in cheerful spirits. ]
NEW YORK. Nov. 10. ? Woodrow

Ja a decided ovprturii in districts miss ! i
ing Wilson will carry New Mexico. ! i
Hughes is leading in Minnesota. j i
The result will not he known in New j
Hampshire until the official couut is j 1
completed. ' c
West Virginia which wns claimed as I'
doubtful until late last night, has gone |
definitely for Hughes. j?
X'nless the vote of California is dl-! J
viaeu wmcn now seems a possibility, | ,
Mr. Wilson is ussured of 209 votes in :
the electoral college, three more than 1
a majority and Mr. Hughes of 212. ' {
The President could lose three votes j
from California and still have enough '
to elect. 'I his loss would he offset by
New Mexico which it seemed certain 5
ho has carried.
If Mr. Hughes carried bolh Minne- 1
sota with 12 and New Hampshire with j
four he would have only 2f>9. seven less J
than enough to elect. Mr. Wilson could '
lose New Slexico and three votes from
California ami still win. \
The result in Minnesota may be de- 1
termined by ballots of the 2.12S guards '
mon now on the Mexican border which ! '
will not be counted until the state can-! 1
vasslng hoard meets next Tuesday. I
Returns received early today in the |
state gave Hughes a lead of slightly j
over 700 votes. 'I
With Oil districts missing out of tiilS |
in New Mexico Wilson was 1,410 ]
ahead
The remote precincts not yet heard ]
from are sparsely settled and it was i
not believed the President's load could
he wiped out. The outcome in New
Hampshire was in greater doubt than :
in nny other states. Certified returns 1
from all hut 25 precincts gave Hughes F
a lead of 131 but unofficial figures 1
from districts lacking were said to
show a Wilson plurality of 117. 1
The tension of the most dramatic r
situation in tlie political history of the j r
United Slates was broken when the <
Associated Press flashed tlio news j *
that Republican State Chairman V
Howell, of California, had conceded '
the stale to Wilson. Frantic appeals t
to expedite returns had been sent to 11
slate leaders hour after hour from National
headquarters of both parties in
this city.
Telegrams wore reinforced by telephono
call across the continent. It
had been apparent since Wednesday /
that California was the pivot upon /
which the election would swing. t
It was not until stage coaches which t
had come through from communities t
cut ofT In the Sierras that the rosalt C
was known. Ordinarily the few votes t
cast in these remote districts arc con- 1
rldercd of little moment but In this (
history making presidential year they I

n many places. There was nothing to I
io but wait for the stages and they I
icgaii coming in last night.
Sitniliar difficulties were encounter,
td in collecting returns from the wihls
if New Mexico ami from the far cor-; 1
tors of Minnesota. In past compaigns !:
Vow Mexico's three electoral votes i 1
lave hcen considered merely as inci- ;
lental in swelling the majority of, ]
he winner, hut yesterday they might ;
lave elected a president. :
Minnesota was almost as important :
is California in the determining :
vhether Hughes or Wilson had won i ;
Liicl the returns from that state cans- ; i
;d nearly as much jubilation among i ;
lepublicans as those from California ! ;
n the rival camp. : t
In three states, however, there were j t
irospects of contests over one elector , i
n each instance. The eligihilty of i' |
Democrat elector in Texas has been |
piestioneri because lie is said to bch
m office holder and the Perioral law j j
irohtnits a person holding orilce from '
ierving as an elector. One of tiro 1
Democratic electors in Massachusetts
lied Just bofor> election day and party t
nauagers attached posters to ballots 1
uhstiluting another name for his. Tho '
egalily of tills procedure has been '
mentioned by Kepublicans. t
A somewhat similar case has arisen 1
n West Virginia where one of the
topuhlican electors refused to run and
mother name substituted by the ltetulilican
state committee was not
irinted on the ballots in all the counios.
