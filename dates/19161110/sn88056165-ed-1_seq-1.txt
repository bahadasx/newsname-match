THREE MORE DEMOCRATS ON THE
STATE TICKET GO IN WITH
HIM
Many Democratic Legislators Also Elected to Help Governor
Carry on Good Work. Connty Goes Democratic
on All But Three Offices.
Woodrow Wilson is again pres
ident of the United States.
This welcome newB was flash« d
broadcast over the land last ev
ening when the final election re
turns came in from California,
giving that state to Wilson l y a
majority of 4400 votes. Arizona,
another doubtful state, also went
into the Wilson column and New
Hampshire, which has been a
solid republican state from time
immemorial, is reported to have
made a complete reversal and
slid into the democratic ranks by
a small majority of a hundred
odd votes.
The election has been a pecu
liar one in that its result has'"re
mained in doubt from the time
the polls closed until the final re
turns were at hand last night.
The first returns from the large
eastern states Tuesday night in
dicated that Hughes would be
elected but by morning the tide
had turned to Wilson and, as
state after state came in, the re
suit wavered between the two
until the last state had made its
report.
While Hughes carried the large
eastern states his majorities
there were cut down enormously
and in several states he barely
pulled through with enough votes
to give him the electoral vote of
the state. The surprise of the
election, however, came from the
western states which had been
claimed by the republicans from
the start and were conceded by
the democrats but which went al
most entirely for Wilson.
Wilson carried Idaho and Gov
ernor Alexander was again suc
cessful, carrying the state by
about 1500 votes. E. L. Parker,
of Cottonwood, was elected lieu
tenant governor over Holt, and
Walters won out for attorney
general and Doughterty for sec
retary of state. This will give
the democratic party control of
the state boards and county re
turns also show that a larger
number of democratic senators
and representatives than usual
were successful this year.
Idaho county swung over into
the democratic column again this
year and elected all but three of
the candidates on the democratic
county ticket. Those who lost
were Tinker, candidate for com
missioner from the first district;
Schroeder, from the second dis
trict, and Atwood for assessor.
The sympathy vote is held re
sponsible for the latter result.
While several of the smaller
mountain precincts are still to be
heard from, the vote there is
naturally light and will not
change the result materially, al
though it is believed they will re
turn slight democratic majorities
in most cases.,
Nationally the county went for
Wilson but Alexander failed to
bold his own against Davis for
governor, while Parker, for lieu
tenant governor, carried the
county over Holt by more than
300 votes.
Following is the vote in the
county as we have been able to
secure the totals up to the time
of going to press.

Mrs. H. Terhaar Called Home
The sad news was received
here by members of the family
early Wednesday morning of the
death of Mrs. Henry Terhaar that
night at the St. Joseph hospital
in Lewiston, where she had un
dergone an operation a few days
before. Grandma Terhaar, as
she was familiarly known, had
been in poor health for some time
and a couple of weeks ago it was
decided to take her to Lewiston
for treatment and later an opera
tion was found necessary. The
operation disclosed that she was
afflicted with cancer of the liver
and other complications and that
her recovery was an impossibil
ity. She rallied nicely from the
operation, however, and teemed
to be improving day by day but
on Tuesday night began to sink
and slept her life away a few
minutes after the midnight hour.
Mary Rieland was born in Ger
many on April 7th, 1850, and
came to this country when a
chiid eleven years of age. She
was later united in marriage to
Henry Terhaar in the state of
Minnesota and resided there for
several years, later coming to
Idaho and settling near this place
some thirty years ago. To this
union thirteen children were
bum, nine of whom are still liv
ing, they being Frank and
George, of this place; Mrs. Chris.
Waldmann and Mrs. Fred Mertes,
of Alberta; Mrs. E. T. Stolz and
and Mrs. A. J. Hoffman of
Greencreek; Mrs. George Lange,
Anton and Ben Terhaar, of this
place.
Grandma Terhaar, as she was
lovingly called, was 66 years, 7
months and 1 day of age at the
time of her death. She was a
loving wife and mother, a true
Christian and stood high in the
esteem of all who knew her. As
a pioneer resident of this county
she braved the hardships of early
pioneer life, maintained her home
and reared her family and yet
found time to assist those about
her in acts of neighborly' kind
ness and charity on countless oc
casions. No one was ever turned
away hungry from the Terhaar
home and many can look back to
happy days spent there and
motherly care given them in
early days when far from their
own homes.
The remains of the deceased
were brought to this place Wed
nesday evening and the funeral
will be held from the local Cath
olic church at 9 o'clock tomorrow
morning.
The sorrowing family has the
deep sympathy of many friends
in their bereavement

Will Organize Brass Band
Cottonwood is at last to have a
brass band. This decision was
reached at a meeting held late
last week when some twenty of
the young men of this town and
vicinity got together and talked
over the proposition and decided
that a town as good as Cotton
wood must needs. have some
music. The plans have not yet
progressed far enough to perfect
an organization but the boys have
decided to furnish their own in
struments and figure on being
able to secure sufficient support
around town and by giving con
certs and dances to meet the ex
pense of an instructor and to buy
the necessary music. Prof. Shat
tuck, of Ferdinand, has agreed
to come over twice a week and
put them through their paces and
it is hoped that they will be able
in the course of a few weeks to
make an occasional appearance
in public.
A band has long been needed
here and we sincerely hope
the present move will result in a
permanent organization being
maintained. There are plenty of
boys and young men hereabouts
who can take part in the work to
make the band a success and at
the same time they will be se
curing much valuable musical in
struction while members of the
band. The town should give the
boys loyal support, for it is much
better to have a band of our own
that* to pay out large sums each
year for outside organizations
and often go without music on
occasions when it is almost in
dispensible.
