NEW YORK, Nov. 9. President Wilscn has carried California and has
been re-elected.
Fifty Hours after the polls closed in- Ca'ifornia. Republican Chairman
Rowoll conceded the state to the president. Thus the thirteen votes needed
to assure the presideit a majority in the electoral college dropped into the
democratic column and apparently ended the suspense and anxiety of an
electicn which has been unparalelle in American political history.
Republican Chairman Wlllcox, wh;p informed that the president carried
California, only replied: "I have nothing to say."
Secretary Tumulty, at the summe- White Houss at Shadow Lawn, sent
the news by wireless to President Wilson on beard the yacht Mayflower,
enroute to Khinecliff, N. Y.
The California returns showed that with only forty-eight districts miss
ing the president's plurality in the state was 2970.
Barring some wholly unexpected tjrn over in the incomplete states
leaning toward Wilson or a chanqe on a recount, California's acquisition
to the democratic column oave the president 269 electoral votes without
New Mexico's three. In New Mexics at midnight the president was lead
inq by 2.634 votes with 153 districts missing and it was not believed this
advantage could" be overcome by Mr. Hughes.
Concedinq West Virginia. New Hamoshire and Minnesota to Mr.
Hughes and he was in the lead in all th-ee only gives him 259 votes,
seven less than the required majority. With 272 votes in sight President
Wilson had six to spare for a possib'e split of electors in California, or a
sudden reversal in New Mexico.

In the senate the reports showed 52

sents a democrat house majority of
one over all others, and a democratic
senate majority of nine with, one miss

which will turn the election to Presi

were in doubt with the voting so close
as to make any safe prediction then
impossible.
In California the president was lead

ing the president by 818 votes with
117 precincts missing. New Hamp-

Wilson, flopped back again to Hughes
by 131 on incomplete returns, 25 pre-

No statement whs forthcoming as

it was admitted that the nationul com
mittee was making preparations to in
stitute proceedings for a recount of
the votes in the states where the re
sult was close but where President
W'ilson had won on the face of in
complete and unofficial returns.
Chairman Willcox said the republi
cans undoubtedly would call for u re
count "in all those states where the
result is close." In this list he in
cluded California, Minnesota, New
Hampshire, New Mexico and North
Dakota.
Mr. Perkins declared every precau

FOR StiCALIFORNIA is CONCEDED TO WILSON
and charges of irregularity made it
plain that even should the doubtful
states claimed by the W Uson man-
agers fall into the Hughes column the
democrats would be slow to concede
the election because of the small mar
gins in some of the states leaning to
Hughes. Indiana whose fifteen votes
have been conceded to the republicans
since last night, had cut the Hughes
lead to about 6,000 with returns still
incomplete. In West V irginia also the
Hughes margin grew less. .
Leaving Minnesota, New Hamp
shire, New Mexico and West Virginia
in the doubtful column, the electoral
college tonight gave Wilson 269,
Hughes 235, and left 27 doubtful.
The possibility of President Wilson
winning with California was compli
cated by predictions that he would not
get all of the electors from the state.
which split them four years ago. Mr.
'fornlu. the president would be forced
to turn to some of the doubtful states
to make up the loss. ,
If Mr. Hughes takes all the doubtful
states, he still will need four of Cali
fornia's electors to get his 266.
In an official statement the demo
cratic national committee claimed 272
votes for President Wilson and a pop-
ular plurality of from 200.000 to 300.0MO.
New Hampshire and possibly in Min

about the recent demanded.
"Virtual'y all the states where the
result is close are carried in the

MAJORITIES IN
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. Congressional
election returns which were nearly
completed tonight, assure President
Wilson in the forthcoming administra
tion, a democratic senate, but, with five
districts still undecided, the best that
the democrats could claim at midnight
was a plurality of four votes in the
house.
Upon the basis of revised returns the
democrats have elected 215 members
of the house and the republicans, 211.
In addition, there have been elected
one independent, one socialist, one pro
pressive and one progressive-protectionist.
Four districts in West Vir
ginia, two of them normally demn-j
cratic, and two republican, and one disJ
trict in New Mexico, are still unde
cided. If these districts do not change
the democrats will have 217 and the
republicans 211, a plurality of oniy
three. As there will be four members
of other minority parties a working
majority for the democratic Is im
probable unless some of the minority
members should choose to cast their
lot with the administration forces.
The senate, according to latest
figures, will consist of 54 democrats
and 42 republicans,, a majority of 12.
nc iirwiifiiaLiu uiajui uy in me pres
ent senate is 16. The only develop
ment in the senatorial situation today
was strongly indicated by the election
of A. A. Jones, the democratic candi
date in New Mexico, who was leading
his republican opponent, Frank A. Hub
bell, by a majority, which democratic
leaders regarded as safe.
An unusual feature of the result is
the l. 'Ion of the first woman to con
gress,! Jeannette Rankin, repub
lican, apparently having been elected
in Montana.
I'ntil a late hour the democrats had
a plurality of six and a noosil.lo m.
jority of one, but revised returns from
New Jersey, indicating the defeat of
Representative Thomas J. Scully,
changed the result. Scullv apparently
has been defeated by Robert Carson,
republican.

CHANGE RESULT
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9. Except
in the event of some exceptional hap
pening Wilson has carried California,
conceded Republican Chairman F.oweli
at 8:25 o'clock tonight.
Mr. Rowell conceded the state after
reviewing returns showing a plurality
of. 2,970 for Wilson with only 48 scat
tered precincts of the state incomplete.
These returns showed 42 of 58 coun
ties in the state completed. In all but
ten counties in the state, returns had
been back checked and corrected. The
possibility of error was thus reduced
to a minimum.
After making the statement 'o the
Associated Press .conceding California
to Wilson, Chairman Rowell carried on
a conversation by wire with George W.
Perkins who was in the offices of the
National republican committee in New
York. Later Mr. Rowell made this
added statement' to the Associated
Press :
"While the face of the returns as
compiled by the Associated Press show i
Wilson ahead in California, so many
startling .changes have happened in
the count during the last twelve hours
that it will not do to reach final con
clusion on anything less than final in
foimation. Th official count begins
Monday and we shall watch the count
ing of every y4e in every county seat
In the state.
"I estimate that there will be differ
ence of 4,000 or 5,000 between the high
and low man on the electoral tickets
and this is greater than any possible
majority in California. This means a
split electoral vote."
"The announcement that Mr. Rowell
has conceded California to President
Wilson, was not unexpected," said .
K. Cushing. chairman of the democrat
ic state central committee.
"From the information we hear from
all counties In the state we confidently
expect that President Wilson's major
ity in California will nbt be less than
3,200. To see that a proper count is
assured) In the state the democratic
committee is offering, a reward of jr.,
Ooo for evidence showing tampering
with the ballot boxes or other irreg
ularities."
to bring in the few remaining isolated
precincts two or three to the county In
most instances. One precinct on the
border of Luke , Tahoe might be miss-
ing for days, it was said. The tele-
phone was broken and efforts to com
municate from Placerville, forty miles
away, were fruitless.
Concession of the state for Wilson
on the face of the returns altered in
no way the determination of both par
tie to keep a sharo watch on the
semi-official count by county clerks
and the final official count by the sec-
I retary of state. With a plurality of
less than 3.000 in mora than 900,000
votes, a difference of one vote in each
precinct might change the whole result.
At 8:30 tonight the democratic cen
tral committee telegraphed to the two
chairmen of the speakers' bureaus
that "we can positively assert that
l"resident Wilson has carried Califor
nia by 2.000."
The telegram was addressed to Ho
mer S. Cummings, New York, and
Charles F. Horner, chairman of the
speakers' bureaus in those cities. The
telegTam read:
"After repeated communications with
every county in the state we can pos
itively assert that President Wilson
has carried California by 2.000."
The state complete may not be
counted for twenty-four hours. It
seems very likely that the orticiai
count will be required to determine
the result.

VOTES MISSING
With both state chairmen with their
pencils poised over reams and reams
of paper, and authentic returns coming
in with exasperating slowness, the race
for the governorship of Arizona re
mained in question last night.
Campbell's majorities, estimated the
night before, did dwindle, but Chair
man Maddock remained confident at
I midnight that there would be a lead
for his candidate when the finals were
sent in. "I can make no statement,"
he said. "There are so many small
precincts out, and reports are changing
so rapidly, that it is impossible to give
any figures."
Chairman Stoneman was more con
fident, or less cautious about his
words. "I claim Hunt's election by
146 votes based on very reliable re
turns. Not counted in my figures, is
tne vote in the north of Mohave coun
ty, beyond the Colornwo river a vote
that Homer Wood of Prescott informs
me is normally democratic, and will
add between 200 and 400 to the Hunt
majority. If this is the case, there is
no question about the re-election of
the administration."
The Republican is in possession of
practically full returns from but four
out of 14 counties Maricopa, Gila,
Pima and Santa Cruz. All other fig
ures are either supplied by campaign
managers in the various county seats,
or are based on estimates, and cannot
be accepted as entirely reliable.
The most reasonable state compila
tion was secured by means of wires to
prominent political observers in every
county, and comes through a semi-official
democratic source. . This table
would give Hunt a lead of but 45 votes
In the state, with at least 65 precincts,
asrgfegating 500, votes, yet to be heard
from. Corrections applied to this ta
ble from the authentic returns in the
four counties above mentioned, change
the result and give Campbell a lead
of S00 votes. The corrected table is

Baughn had been elected over Judge
Ross by a slight margin. He lost
Maricopa by about 200 votes, carried

in several other important democratic
counties.
