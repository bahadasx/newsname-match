BOWMAN MAKES KICK
TO STATE CHAIRMAN
Abnormal Vote Cast in Tuesday's
Elec tion—New Count Might
Cause Change in Results
DOYLE CHARGES.
Fargo, N. D., Nov. 9.—If there is
any serious basis for United
States Marshal Doyles' report to
the United States Attorney Hit
dreth, that there we"e "attempts
at tampering with the ballot boxes
in North Dakota," nothing beyond
Hildreth's statements that he will
prosecute ballot box tarriperers,
has developed. Marshal Doyles'
action culminated, it is under­
stood, from an appeal sent to him
by Vance MeCormick, chairman of
the Democratic. national commit­
tee, and by the New York World,
one of Wilson's strongest support­
ers.
Officials were tonight unwilling
to specify any particular reports
of ballot box tampering in this
state.
Attorney Hildreth issued a state­
ment to the effect that he was pre­
pared' to prosecute anybody en­
gaged in ballot box tampering.
Contending that the evident intent
of many voters was ignored by election
boards in canvassing the returns of
Tuesday's election, and that as a re­
sult hundreds of votes throughout the
state which plainly had been cast for
Hughes were thrown out, prominent
Capital City Republicans are seriously
considering filing a demand for a re­
count.
One of the objectors states that he
has almost positive knowledgo that
thirty Hughes votes were thrown out
in Burleigh county because of a techni­
cal error in their marking. The two
boxes in which a choice for presiden­
tial electors might be Ascorded on the
official ballot were found confusing by I
a large number of voters. Many, it is'
claimed, after making a cross at the
head of the ticket, made their mark
in the second division of Hughes elec­
tors. where blank lines are left for in­
dividual nominations, instead of plac­
ing their check-mark opposite the
names of the Hughes electors foramlly
endorsed. All of these ballots, it is
claimed, were thrown out, although
the intent of the voter to give Hughes
his ballot was made apparent by the
cross at the top of the column as well
as his check in the space reserved for
national electqfs.
If the number of ballots thrown out
in other counties proved as great as
it is believed it would in Burleigh, the
result of the recount might, it is con­
tended. give North Dakota to Hughes.
While this probably would not affect
the national issue, it would give the
Republicans of this state the satisfac­
tion of knowing that their rights were
not being infringed.
Bowman Also Kicks.
COUNTY POOR FARM
ISSUE IS DEFEATED
Jamestown. X. D.. -Nov. t).—The vot­
ers of Stutsman county in Tuesday's
election defeated the proposition of
selling the county poor farm, its ap
purtenances and personal property,

Bowman county has a kick as well'
as Burleigh. Both complaints have
been filed with the Republican state
headquarters at Fargo, where Chair­
man William Lenike is expected to­
morrow to announce whether a state­
wide recount is to be asked. Bowman
contends that votes in which the elec­
tor's intent, was evident were thrown
out on insufficient technical grounds.
In neither case is thfere a direct charge
of irregularity. The complaint is
made rather on the grounds of mis­
directed zeal in enforcing the letter of
ilie law, and the resultant violation of
its spirit.
SM CELEBRATION
Fargo, X. D., Xov. 9.—Confident of
Wilson's re-election, Fargo Democrats
engaged in a great celebration through
the down town districts tonight, a
band and fireworks adding to the fes­
tivities.
Several thousands participated in
the celebration that gave Democrats
opportunity to vent their enthusiasm.
Vance McCormick's message late in
the day, declaring positively that it
was Wilson, caused plans for the cele­

Hughes Makes
No Comment
New York, Nov. 9.—Word that Cali­
fornia had been carried by President
Wilson on the fact of nearly complete
unofficial returns were carried to Mr.
Hughes shortly before he retired to­
night. He declined to comment on
th? situation. After communication
with national headquarters, members
of Mr. Hughes' staff said the question
of a recount would be considered to­
morrow.

Little
Xow that Wilson lias captured the
state, the contest /between Steen and
Casey holds tlu: center if the stage.
These candidates for state treasurer
on the face of incomplete returns,
promise to fight out as close a battle
as their national party leaders,
Hughes and Wilson, did, with the
odds favoring (sey tlipy have
Wilson.
In 1,774 precincts out of 1,078 SUsen
has 44,7115 to Casey's 44,'522, or a lead
of 191. Cut no returns are obtain­
able as yet from Hillings, Dickey,
Xelson, Pembina and Kollette. Rural
districts in these counties are being
depended upon to give Casey a lead.
This is the only doubtful contest
cn the state ticket.
The Fighting Chance.
Steen has a fighting chance, al­
though present returns are not ade­
quate to venture a guess. The five
missing counties and few scattering
returns can change matters entirely.
Casey's strength is coming from the
rural precincts, and. until they arc
all in, one can merely speculate.
The fact that Steen has overcome
Casey's lead of about 1,000 in the
returns from 200 additional precincts
yesterday yesterday is -giving his
friends hope. Casey's vote in 1,575
precincts out of 1,978 reported Thurs­
day morning was 40,407 to Steen's
38,735. Latest, returns comprise 1,774
precincts showing a ain for Steen.
.Morton county especially piled up a
good vote for Steen. The results are
told by counties in another column.
Frazier Vote Large»t.
Frazier's vote in only 1,745 pre­
cincts out of 1,978, is 75.982, the larg­
est cast for a gubernatorial candidate
in the history of Xorth Dakota, and
4,077 greater than the total ballots
voted for both Hanna and Hellstrom
in 1912. Frazier is now 57,992 votes
ahead of MacArthur, his Democratic
opponent, and, judging from the al­
most complete returns in the presi­

St. I'aul, Minn., Xov. 9.—Three
nights of unofficial canvassing have
failed to take Minnesota from the
doubtful column in the presidential
race. Charles E. Hughes maintained
a slight lead over Wilson throughout
today, but the count continued so
close that politicians of both parties
declared tonight that only the offi­
cial count would settle the presiden­
tial contest.
When returns had been received
from 2,939 precincts out of 3,024 in
the state. Mr. Hughes had a plural
itv or 737, the count standing:
'Wilson, 175,399.
Hughes, 176,136.
Except for president Minnesota de­
livered its customary big Republican
majority, as shown in the pluralities
given Gov. .1. A. A. I urnquist and
Frank 15. Kellogg, candidate for the
United States senate. Republicans
also were uniformly successful on the
ballots of the state ticket.
Hughes' lead in the state was
threatened several times today by re­
turns from the northern part of the
state, but always some other section
added the necessary votes to the Re­
publican column to keep him ahead.
Great Interest in Outcome.
The closeness of the vote attracted
unusual interest throughout the state,
