EVACUATION Of

IS LOOKFL) FOR
Carranza Troops Moved to
Juarez—Gonzales Denies
the Report.
GARRISON MAY NOT
STICK TO CARRANZA
His Paper Dollar Drops to
One Cent in Value—
Troops Uneasy.
Bi Paso, Tex., Nov. 10.—A special
train has arrived at Juares with 600
Carransa troops aboard. American
army officers believe this to be the be
ginning of the evacuation of Chihua
hua City by General Trevlno.
General Gonzales in Juares declar
ed the troops are being sent north for
duty In western Chihuahua, denying
that Chihuahua City Is to be evacu
ated.
B1 Paso, Texas, Nov. 10.—Ten
wealthy British residents of Chi
huahua, and half of their number
women, arrived at Juares last night
with other refugees. They reported
that the foreign consuls, Including the
British, still remained In the city, al
though the foreign colony had been
reduced to a comparative few except
for the Germans, who with a few ex
ceptions are staying behind.
While Chihuahua City is still calm.
It was learned that some apprehen
sion was felt over the loyalty of the
garrison.. General Trevlno was
credited with an effort to raise silver
money to pay the men. Some of the
soldiers were said by refugees to be
tearing up their paper money on pay
day and throwing It In their officers'
faces.
The Carransa paper dollar Is now
down to one cent gold, they said.
Street cars are not running In Chi
huahua city, it was reported, owing
to a shortage of coal.
British refugees brought a report
from Chihuahua City that Villa ban
dits were defeated at Conejos, about
200 miles south of tl^at city by Car
ransa forces from Torreon under
General Francisco Murgla. No de
tails were known In Chihuahua City
when they left of the 'battle, but a
train is expected to report from TOT
reon today with a report of the Villa
defeat, the refugees said.
Nothing was known In Chihuahua
City of the fate of the Americans of
Parral and Magistral when the train
left there today. The refugees said
it was believed that the Americans
and foreigners from Parral had gone
toward the state of Durango and had
escaped.
