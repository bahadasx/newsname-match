' Homer S.. Oummings has tatly made
tip his mind that-the excessive use of

He will cause an Investigation to the

that Connecticut will know how much

- much Fairfield county got, and who
expended it, and who got It. ,
, Mr. Cummings said today:
$ "With reference to the alleged cor
ruption, and fraud in "connection" tyith
' ? the ' present election in Connecticut;"
h said, "I have only this to say: ,
"A: thorough investigation will, he"
made., I act upon the assumption that
all good citizens desire 'to preserve
the sanctity of the ; ballot by . every
legitimate means and if any citizen is
in possession fat any information on
this subject he should place the facts
at the disposal of the public author-
lities., It' has been common knowledge
for a long time among. those inform-
, efl.as to' political conditions in Con
' necticut that it was possible for large
Bums of. money to be expended indi
rectly '; for the benefit of -candidates
who .apparently were themselves
spending ,but little. . '
v "Qur corrupt practices act should
be amended so as to check jthe exor
bitant and lavish expenditures which
can have no other effect that to tend
toward, corruption -atid fraud. A 11m
' It : should be ! placed upon the num
ber .of so-called 'workers who can
be employed for a remuneration on
election, day. . These are the things
, Jn- which all good citizens, irrespective
of party are Interested. -It is time that
Connecticut citizenship took a stand
in the matter to rid Connecticut of
eome ft the unenviable reputation that
has come to it because of the corrupt
ible vote in 'this state, and the man
ner in Which it has been handled by
people whose, zeal to . win outshines

Rhinecliffe, N. Y., Nov. 10 The
naval yacht Mayflower, with Presi
dent Wilson and Mrs. Wilson aboard,
on their way to Williamstown, Mass.,
arrived off Rhinecliffe early today
after an uneventful trip up the Hud
son river.
The Mayflower anchored off Rhine
cliffe before daybreak but the Presi
dent did not come ashore until 9:50
o'clock to take his train for Williams
town, where he goes to act as god
father at the christening of the sec
ond child of his daughter, Mrs. F. B.
Sryre. Throngs lined the river bank,
many carrying American flags, and
when the Mayflower's launch, carry
ing the President and Mrs. Wilson,
was seen to put off from the yacht,
the crowd rushed excitedly toward
the landing to greet them.
Enthusiastic cheers went up as the
President and his wife, assisted by
Captain Jerry, of the Mayflower, step
ped ashore. The President's face
was wreathed 'in smiles. He. had re
ceived by wireless the word that he
had been re-elected. He raised his
hat and waved it to the crowd as he
and Mrs. Wilson set out on foot for
the railroad station nearby. -

CONGRATULATING
THE PRESIDENT
New ' York, Nov. 10. rLawrence
Green, secretary to Charles p. Hughes,
said today in response to questions by
newspapermen that Mr. Hughes would
not today send congratulations to
President Wilson.
"Not yet," said Mr. Green.
Mr. Hughes himself declined to
make any comment upon the election
results. He rose about 8 o'clock and
after reading the newspapers went for
an automobile ride. He was appar
ently in cheerful spirits.
It was expected at his hotel that he
would receive a visit 'during the day
from Republican National Committee
man Willcox and one or two other
party leaders, probably after the con
ference at Republican headquarters
set for noon hour on the qnestlon
of a recount of the vote in close states.
This matter, It was understood, Mr.
Hughes was leaving entirely in the
hands of .his campaign managers, . al
though before taking definite action it
was, expecte'd they would consult with
him to learn his views.

With President Wilson's re-election absolutely assured by the returns from Cali
fornia, the Presidential situation today resolved itself into a question of the size of his
majority in the Electoral College.
With the 13 from California, President Wilson is certain of 269 electoral votes.
In addition, he is more than likely to receive New Mexico's three votes. New Hamp
shire's four votes are also claimed for the President on the face of unofficial complete
returns. J - v ' v
Vance C. McCormick, Democratic national chairman, will not concede Minnesota
to the Republicans though Hughes is leading by about 800 plurality. Mr. McCormick
claims the state by 500 or more for Wilson! - ' - (

San Francisco, Nov. 10 With Cali

conceded to Wilson, interest in the

of a split electoral delegation which
has been predicted.
Only 3 precincts remained to be
heard from early today when Wilson's
lead was 3,151. As the missing pre
cincts are in sparsely settled coun
ties, it was believed that the Presi
dent's plurality would not be changed
materially.
Both Secretary of State Jordan and
Chester H. Rowell, chairman of the
R-epublican state central committee,
who early last night conceded the
state to "Wilson, says there is a possi
bility of a split delegation as happen
ed four years ago. An official count
under the supervision of Jordan prob
ably will be given next Tuesday.
