THE GOLDEN WEST
Talk about the country
In tho golden West
Its palms and eucalypti
Its olives and tho rest
Its wonders and Its beauty
Marvelous may be
But the state of old Ohio
Is good enough for me
Its oranges and lemons
In orchards may be seen
Tho yellow ot the juicy fruits
Aglow In leaves of green
Their blooms are white and fragrant
And beautiful to see
Yet tho frluts of old Ohio
Aro good enough for me
Folks rave about Its mountains
And wondrous snow capped peaks
They travel In and mong them
For many many weeks
And love the rugged grandeur
Of cliff and rock and tree
Still tho landscapes of Ohio
Aro good enough tor me
The clear and sparkling waters
That tumble down its hills
And the mountain precipices
In waterfalls and rills
Are picturesque and cooling
And lively I agree K
Still tho waters ot Ohio J
Are good enough for me
Of course It has a climate
None of us need dread
And you may make engagements
A good six months ahead
For no precipitation
Will mar your plans you see
But the climate of Ohio
Is good enough for me
They claim It is a country
In every way just right
They boost and boost Its glories
All day and through tho night
But Jve a hunch a comln
It fills me with great glee
That Ohio needs no boostln
And Its good enough for me
And when our lives are over
And wo lie down to rest
Well slumber Just as sweetly
In tho East as In the West
For a plape to live and die in
And fulfill a destiny
The State of old Ohio
Is good enongh foe me

Committees Report
November 4 th 1916
County Commissioners
Gentlemen
Pursuant to your rcauest that wo
should Investigate the situation exist
ing in the county Infirmary at Can-
field Ohio out of which grow tho
case of Marie Higglns and Joo Sirak
we went to the infirmary spending
most or Friday Nov 3 1916 In our
investigation and have the following
report to make
First We carefully examined tho
premises noting the location of doors
windows exits halls etc
Second Wo had Marie Higglns
brought to us and In our presenco
only we had her go over with us tho
rooms In which she claimed she had
been confined
Third We then went with her to
tho room and In our presenco only
very carefully nnd at great length
went over her story with her
Fourth Wo also Interviewed Mr
Robert Taylor the former superin
tendent and Mr Charles Lee tho
present superintendent and Dr L D
Coy carefully noting his opinion ot
her mental and physical condition
fore and after tho happening ot tho
occurrence claimed by her
Fifth We also examined the de
fendant Joe Sirak
Wo find that Marie Higglns Is in
the same physical conditon now that
sho was In when she was last seen
by tho officials of the Infirmary ten
months ago and we make this find
ing upon our personal observation of
Mario Higglns now and from tho med
ical testimony of Dr L D Coy and
the testimony of the present superin
tendent Mr Charles Lee who has
been connected with the Institution
for the past eight years
It is tho unanimous opinion of
jour committee that the story as told
by Marie Higglns as to ner oeing
forcibly confined to the room describ
ed by her Is a fabrication pure and
simple for the following reasons
First The room Is so situated that
people were dally coming very close
to it
Second There are three exits to
tho room through which a person
could easily escape which bear no
appearance of having been barricad
ed to prevent an escape Tho door
which sho claimed was barricaded
she says was covered with a wlro
guard through which sho says sho
could see and be seen and heard
Third We find that sho had free
access to five rooms with two largo
corridors ono of which leads to tho
outside
Fourth We further find from her
own testimony that Superintendent
Charles Lee was working on pipes in
the cellar and that she placed herself
in ono of these rooms and saw Mr
Lee pass personally on two different
occasions and made no ntempt to com
municate with him
Fifth Wo also find that Joe Sirak
was the Bhoemaker for the inmates
and that the inmates were commun
icating with him daily concerning his
work She also says that she know
where Joo Sirak was at al tlme3 and
that he was away from the rooms
many many times leaving her en
tirely alone for hours at a tlmo that
that she finally left through a corridor
through which in the lplnlon of your
cqmmlttee she could havo left at
any time
Sixth Aside from the inmates ev
ery official conected with the insti
tution had free access to the five
rooms and tho corridors in which
this woman claims to have been con
fined
For the above reasons and many
others your committee unanimously
and unhesitatingly find that Mario
Higglns was not confined against her
will
And we therefore find that none ot
the officials conected with this hap
pening are responsible In any way for
tho affair
Respectfully submitted
