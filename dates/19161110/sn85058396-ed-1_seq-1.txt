I Wilson Elected President I
ELECTION OF WILSON
! IS NOW CONCEDED BY
If THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
'
I California Plurality for President Steadily In
I creasing Lead Growing in
I New Mexico.
New York, Nov. 10. Republican Na
tional Chairman William R. Willcox,
following a conference of the cam
' palgn managers today, refused to con
: cede the election of President Wilson.
In a formal statement, he declared
.; that the result still depends upon the
vote of close states and that the re
turns from those were so far unoffl-
clal and might be changed by the of
ficial count. Mr. Wlllcox stated, how
: ever, that the national committee
: would abide by the decision of the of
' ficial count unless special circum-
: stances arose which made other action
; unnecessary.
This was the important development
? in the presidential election situation
up to 1 o'clock today. Returns con
j tinued to filter in from states which.
had been close, but they made no
change In the figures which gave Pres
fi ident Wilson 269 electoral votes and
Mr Hughes 243.
3 Minnesota, New Mexico and New
- Hampshire remained in doubt. Minne
ij sota's latest returns showed Hughes
jjj leading by 752, but the'f igures for New
t Hampshire put Wilson ahead by 239,
with 11 precincts missing, while ho
'? also led in New Mexico.
At Democratic national headquar
i ters the view is taken that the elec
"i tion is all over. Chairman McCormlck
! is preparing to go to his home in Har-
risburg, Pa tonight to resume his prl
' vate business, he said today. Work
's men were removing the furniture and
' the committee's local business, it was
stated, would be .conducted at a branch
office. The main headquarters will bo
j in Washington.
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 10. One
: more precinct in California had been
I reported by 9:30 a. m. today, reducing
i the missing ones to 34. The total with
out the missing precincts stood:
Hughes, 462,551; Wilson, 465,711.
i Wilson's plurality, 3,160.
t This was an Increase of 29 votes for
J Wilson over last night Seven pre
I l f-r UiirnhnlrU
county in the northwest corner of the
state and seven from Kern in the oil
Wt fields. Humboldt went for Hughes,
I and Kern for Wilson. The others were
scattered here and there.
Election officials hero, said it would
be impossible to check these missing
precincts against the vote of previous
elections because of lack of knowledge
as to exactly which precincts in each
;J county were still missing. Efforts to
clean up the state vote were put forth
"i by news associations and by the or
j ganlzations of the two big parties.
I Usual means of communication -were
: supplemented by the forest service
'j telephones in the Siorras, and automo
'i biles and horsemen were sent on
'': roads and trails where there was no
, telephone communication.
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 10. Re
? turns from 5,839 of 5,870 precincts in

returns from 283 precincts out of 294
In New Hampshire give Hughes, 42,
045; Wilson, 42,284. Wilson's lead,
239.
These figures, according to Secre
tary of State Bean, include the return
of the clerk of Ward 2, Keene, who
certified that Wilson electors received
no votes there, although press fig
ures credited them with 125. Efforts
are being made to correct this return
which the secretary of state believes
to be an error. Its effect would be to
increase the Wilson plurality.
Press returns from 11 precincts not
accounted for In the counties not cer
tified gave Hughes, 1,170; Wilson,
1,360. As a result the vote of the
state is still regarded in doubt
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 10 With hard
ly more than 50 precincts to hear
from, Governor Hughes' plurality in
Minnesota at noon today was 752, but
Fred Wheaton, chairman of the Dem
nfratfr stnfo rfntrnl committee, still
insisted: "We feel sure of Minnesota
for Wilson."
"Ballots cast under the provisions
of the 'absent voters' bill which allows
traveling men and railway men to voto
the national ticket away from home is
not Included, and this vote will wipe
out the Hughes lead," Mr. Wheaton
said. The vote of the state troops at
the Mexican border also will help cut
the Hughes margin, according to Fred
Lynch, Democratic national commit
teeman from Minnesota.
E. L, Thornton, chairman of the Re
publican state central committee, de
clared the rural ballots still to report
would offset any Wilson gain among
absent voters, and claimed a lead
among the state guardsmen.
St Paul, Minn., Nov. 10. Returns

GERMAN! SURE II
OF FINAL VICTORY I I
Chancellor Hollweg Quotes jl
'Reports and Reassures Peo- '
pie Nation Is Invincible. j, jH
Amsterdam, Nov. 10, via London, I
10:15 a. m. Chancellor von Beth-
mann-Hollweg in his speech before
the reichstag committee yesterday, ex-
pressed the opinion that Germany was f
certain of final victory. The chancel- L
lor is quoted in .reports published here
as having said:
"England and France in 1915 guar- ,
anteed to Russia territorial rule over )
Constantinople, the Bosphorus and the i
western shores of the Dardanelles i '
with its Hinterland, while Asia Minor I
was to be divided among the members I
of the entente. The annexation in
tentions of our enemies also include ;
Alsace-Loraine, which the League of . .
Peace is to guarantee them. Such a '
policy of course cannot form a basis 1 1
for an effective peace union. Gcr- j ,
many is ready at all times to join a '
union of the peoples and even to j
place herself at the head of such a M'
union to restrain a disturber of the if 1 vM
peace. Not In the shadow of Prus-
sian militarism did the world live be- 'f
fore the war, but in the shadow of a
policy of isolation which was to keep 1 'M
norm on i' HnTvn c IH
"Against this policy, whether it ap- jj
pears diplomatically as an encircle- i
ment, militarily as a war of destruc-
tion, or economically as world boycott j
we, from the beginning, were on the iH
defensive. The German people wage il
this war as a defensive war for tho J (
safety of its national existence, for its j
free development We never pretend- ;
ed anything else, never intendd any-
thing lse. Not otherwise can be ex- ,1 jH
! plained this display of gigantic force, 1
this inexhaustible heroism unexam- jl
pled in all human history.
"Tho enemy obstinately wills to war jH
with tho calling up of military mate- IH
rial and auxiliary forces from all parts jH
of the world. These efforts harden -H
our resistance to still greater determi- , IH
nation. Whatever England can still IH
bring up of strength and England's ' ll
command of strength has its limits ' 'H
it is predestined to fail before our will , ;H
to live. This will is unconquerablo H
and we await the enemy's recognition j
of this, confident that this recognition
must come. 'jH
