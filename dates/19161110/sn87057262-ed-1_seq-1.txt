out today without conceding Wilson's
election. National Ohairman Willcox
announced determination to press for
a recount in four of the doubtful
states—California, New Hampshire,

It was Willcox's contention that the

choice of national executive and that
they would not desire to have a man
in the white house on whose title
there was the slightest cloud.

No Doubt of It.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff

NEfW YORK, Nov. 10.—Taking the
unofficial count at its face value,
there was no doubt this afternoon
that Woodrow Wilson and Thomas R.
Marshall had been re-elected presi
dent and vice president. The repub
lican national committee however,
did not view that unofficial count as
closing what has been in many re
spects the most complex election In
the history- of the nation. A confer
ence of O. O. p. chieftains who gath
ered at headquarters shortly before
noon, was still in session at 1:30 pre
sumably mapping out the states
in which the party intends to insti
tute proceeding for recount or pos
sible court proceedings. A formal
statement issued by them with the
approval of Governor Hughes, de
clared many returns so far tabulated
were unofficial and already many mis
takes having an Important bearing on
the final result have been discovered.
They said they owed it to the Ameri
can people to see that an absolutely
correct and honest count is made.
The leaders said they expectfed the
official count to be completed by next
Monday. Chairman Willcox, George
Perkins, George W- Wickersham,
Frank H. Hitchcock, Travis If." Whit
ney, Herbert Parsons, Cornelius N.
Bliss Jr. were conferees.
At democratic headquarters, Chair
man McCormick said goodbye and
prepared, he said, to live the simple
life again at HarriSburg. Headquar
ters were being dismantled this aft
ernoon. McCormick said he classified
as "doubtful" all those states from
which complete returns had not yet
been made, but that even with these
out. President Wilson's total vote
was far above the 266 votes needed
to elect.
New Hampshire, after floundering
from one candidate to another in the
vote count during the last two days,
appeared at last to have settled defi
nitely on Wilson, But with the count
still incomplete.
Minnesota will probably be in doubt
until next Tuesday when the vote of
the state militiamen now on the
Texas border, is received and
counted.
California's count, still incomplete,
showed Wilson leading by 3,893 votes.

though official figures as determined
continue to back the republican com

iWTOK THE FRENCH ARMIES AT
VERDUN, Nov. 10.—The only German
occupant of the shell scarred, batter
ed, but still firm. Fort Van* when
the French trfaunpfaantly entered it,
was a nondescript dog and he is now
being treated with all the honors of
war—tout out of German sapplies.
Such was their baste in abandoning
the fort that the Germans left be
hind a million cartridges, three thous
and meat rations, three thousand
bottles of mineral water and large
quantities of antitetanus seruxns and
other drugs now unobtainable outside
of Germany.
Wljth their artillery In place, the
JVjrt Vaiux garrison now dominates
the entire surrounding plains. New
lines otf German entrenchments are
vaguely visible several kilometers
off. They are in low marshy ground

sible to entrendh firmly.
In the twelve hours 1 was In tfce

til dusk, the Germans jAelled It al
most constantly, the big projectflfeB
tbuddfng down every moment with
clock like regularity. Some hit the
roof, making the whole structure
reverberate, but without doing dam
age.
The garrison was gay and watched
with interest while the c&mmaiid
ant counted the hits. Lieutenant
Eirlot, the first French soldier to re
enter Vaux, came up laraghlngly sal
uting, "mon capitain," said:
"The quest Don of your observation
post has been finally settled. A Ger
man f&en Just destroyed the one you
chose so you will have to take mine."
The first intimation to the French
that Vaux had been abandoned came
when the Paris wireless picked a
German semi-official story to the
American press out of the air. The
French had then almost entirely sur
rounded the fort and were shelling
it with four hundred millimetre guns
with a precision whioh would have
made Its continued tenancy by the
Germans impossible.
With the news, Dlot and his com
pany immediately entered and suc
ceeded with but few exceptions, in
rendering useless the planted mines,
with which the Germans had intend
ed to blow up the fort after French
occupation. The several that did ex
plode went off prematurely and did
only a superficial damage.
One of the prizes of the French
was the record book of the German
commandant, containing plans for
the reorganization of the fort and
data on the killed and wounded in
the recent fighting. The new figures
lead the French to estimate tie total
German losses at Verdun at 700,000.
At noon Wednesday the garrison
heard that Hughes had been elected.
The word came by wireless to Gen

[By J. (H. Foray. United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
SAN FRANCIBOO, Calif., Nov. 10.—
California has swung into the Wood^
row Wilson column, according to com*
plete returns from all but thirty"
threw of the state's 5,866 precinct*
early today.
The sine of the president's plurality
will not be determined until the offi
cial count is completed and a number
of expected revisions have been
made, but 6,883 precincts bhow him
leading Charles Brans Hughes by 8,«
296 votes. The complete figures oa
these precincts as tabulated by the
United Press at an early hone, gave
mi—
Retums are complete from all but
thirteen of the fifty-eight counties
and In these, not more than three pre
cincts are missing. The thirty-three
preoincts yet to report will not change
the general result in California, al
though they may reduce President
Wilson's plurality somewhat.
The uncertainty of the president's
plurality Is caused somewhat by an
apparent confusion In Humboldt
county. F. M. Kay. county clerk of
that county, telegraphed the United
Press last night giving the official
count with only six precincts missing,
as: Hughes 5,670 Wilson, 5.041. On
the face of the figures Wilson's vote
in Humboldt county was increased by
more than 1,000 over figures given in
earlier returns. To check against:
the possibility of error, the United
Press made efforts to reach' Kay in
order to verify hiB figures, but bad
not succeeded early today.
In an extra edition this •morning fhe
San Francisco Chronicle, one of the
•taunchest Hughes supporters in tho
west, conceded California to Wilson1
by a plurality of about 3,000 and de
clared the president had been re
elected. Chester Rowel!, republican
state chairman, however, was not will
ing early today to concede the state
to tho president without qualification.
He admitted that California had ap
parently gone democratic on the face
of almost complete returns, but as
serted that he would not abandon
hope until the official count had been
finished.
"Because of the substantial errors
already discovered in unofficial
counts," he said, "it is seen to be
quite possible to change the appar
ent result of the voting in California
by detecting and correcting similar
and yet undiscovered errors."
NOT STEPPING AS HIGH
AS HE FORMERLY DID
Meanwhile, democratic leaders, too.

he started out last July on his 34,000
mile campaign tour.
Early this forenoon Hughes had
sent no message of congratulation to
President Wilson. This was taken In
some Instances as indicating he and
Chairman Willcox together with one
or two others, may delay their usual
exchange until the official count is
complete in all close states.
Willcox and Hughes have not yet
conceded defeat. Another factor in
this connection is exactly what action
the republican national committee In
tends taking in regard to proposed
recounts.
Hughes attended the theatre last
night with Mrs. Hughes and a party
of friends, to see William Collier in
"Nothing But the Truth." Mrs. Hughes
apparently forgot all about the elec
tion in her interest in the show, but
she showed plainly the effects of the
strain.

the two or three blocks to and from
the theatre. Few recognized them on
the streets, but they were accorded
