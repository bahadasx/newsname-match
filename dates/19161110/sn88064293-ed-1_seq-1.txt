WILSON WINS
Latest Returns Give Democratic Candidate
272 Electoral Votes. Republicans

Election. A Re-Count Moy Be Necessary
New York, Nov. 10.—On the face
of almost complete returns from
every state in the Union, Woodrow
Wilson has been re-elected as Presi
dent of the United States over
Charles Evans Hughes, the Republi
can opponent.
President Wilson has carried Cali
fornia and has won.
Fifty hours after the polls closed
in California, Republican Chairman
Rowell conceded the state to the
President. Thus the thirteen votes
needed to assure the President a
majority in the electoral college
dropped into the Democratic column
and apparently ended the suspense
and anxiety of an election which is
unparalleled in American political
history.
Republican Chairman Willcox,
when informed that the President
had carried California, only replied:
"I have nothing to say."
Secretray Tumulty, at the sum

sent the news to President Wilson
on board the yacht Mayflower en
route to Rhinecliff, N. Y.
The Californa returns showed
that with only 48 districts missng
