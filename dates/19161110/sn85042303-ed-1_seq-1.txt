TENSE SITUATION BROKEN WITH
FLASH ON THE CALIFORNIA RESULT
WHEN ASSOC'k JED PRESS FLASHED OVER COUNTRY LAST NIGHT THAT
WILSON HAL) 'z f CEIVED ELECTORAL VOTE OF CALIFORNIA, TENSION OF
THE MOST DRAMATIC SITUATION IN THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE
UNITED STATES WAS BROKEN.
Stage Coaches Brought from Isolated Districts of the Golden State, Returns Which Could
Be Obtained by no Other Source -Similar Difficulties Encountered in Collecting
Returns from Wilds of New Mexico and Isolated Corners of Minnesota
Vote of Minnesota Soldiers on the Border, wftich will not be
Canvassed Until Tuesday, May Decide Result in Min
nesota, where Hughes now Leads with 1000
(By Associated Press)
New York, Nov. 10. Woodrow Wilson was re-elected presi
dent of the United States last night, when California swung
into the demoutratic column. A few hours previous North Da
kota had been conceded to the democrats, and with California's
thirteen electoral votes, Wilson was assured 269 votes, three
more than the necessary 266.
Todav the only states in doubt are Minnesota, New Hamp
shire and New Mexico', with 19 electoral votes. Unless there is
a decided overturn in the districts missing, Wilson will carry
New Mexico. Hughes is leading in Minnesota. It will take
the official count to determine the result in New Hampshire.
West Virginia went to the Hughes column last night.
The result in Minnesota may be- determined by the ballots of
the 2,133 national guardsmen on the border, which will not be
counted until the state canvassing board meets next Tuesday.
Early today the returns in Minnesota gave Hughes a lead of
about one thousand votes.
The tension of the most dramatic situation in the political
history of the United States was broken when the Associated
Press flashed the news that the California state republican
chairman had conceded the state to Wilson. It was not until
the stage coaches came through from the isolated snow-bound
communities in the Sierras that the result was known. Or
dinarily the few votes of these districts are unimportant, but
they were needed to determine the winner last night. They
could not be reachd by wire. Similar difficulties were encoun
tered in collecting returns from the wilds of New Mexico and
the isolated corners of Minnesota.
