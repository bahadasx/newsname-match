PRESIDENT WILSON AND VICE PRESIDENT MARSHALL.
WILSON'S RE-ELIECTION IS
CONCEDED BY REPUBLICANS
Tlhat P'resi(denlt \ ilson has carried California, thus
givi ig himi the thi'rteen( votes necessary to assure his
re-election, is (,oncede(d by the republican headquarters,
according to late reports this morning.
The California returns showed that with only 48
districts yet to be heara from president Wilson's plur
ality in the state was 2970.
Wilson now has a total of 269 electoral votes, Hughes
235, with 27 doubtful.
Anxious waiting; since Tuesday evening has filled
the bosoms of the supporters of the two leading political
factions with many emotions, early reports from eastern
states led Hughes supporters to the belief that he was
safely elected. All day Wednesday the smile lingered
but late in the day was stricken with pallor, finally
disappearing. No one will begrudge these worthy
patriots their one happy moment in eight years.
LOUISIANA STATE FAIR I
THE BIGGEST AND BEST
"The biggest and best ever," was
the comment of Parish Agent H. C. l
Fdndren, who returned Monday after- I
noon from the State Fair at Shreve- r
port. The agricultural hall which has (
been enlarged by an addition of about
4,000 square feet floor space, was
filled to the doors with every variety
of farm products, the quantity and
quality of which would make Ceres I
green with envy. Mr. Fondren visit
ed the Texas State Fair at Dallas two
weeks ago and says that Louisiana
has already passed that state in her
exhibition of farm products as well
as boys and girls' industrial club
work.
Every available space in the big
beef and dairy barns was taken and
a good number of cattle was being
housed under tents and other im
provised barn room. A large swine
barn recently ejected along side of
the ori nal hog barn for the purpose
of accommodating the swine from the
pig clubs, was filled to its capacity,
the quality of which may be attest
ed by the fact that little Robert Reid
of Tallulah, La., won six blue ribbons
over the best swine breeders of Lou
isiana, Texas and Mississippi. Many
i sale of dairy and beef cattle were re
corded, the mot noticeable of which
was the purchase by P. H. and A. A.
Hoag and Del Marshall of nine head
of pure bred Red Polled cattle from
the famous Knight Bros, herd, of Cas
piana, Okla., and which brings to Jef
ferson Davis parish the first high
class herd of this well known dual pur
pose strain of cattle. This marks the
fifth entry into the big registered beef
type breeding in Jefferson Davis par
ish and augurs well for the future of
this parish as a producer of beef stock.
Mr. Fondren says he met up with 28
people at the fair from Jefferson Da
vis and there were doubtless others,
as the crowd was such that one could
easily spend a day there without see
ing all the visitors from your home
parish. The attendance on Saturday
was about 25,000, while Sunday
bro6ght nearly 30,000 visitors to the

JENNINGS WOULD HEAHR
STEAMBOATS WHISTLE '
That Jennings will soon have steam p
boats anchoring witlhin her corporate fi
limits now seems assured. At the it
regular meeting of the Chamber of b
Commerce Monday night the ques
tion of constructing a canal from the
Mermentau river to a point inside the
corporation lines of the city was dis
cussed and a committee of three, T.
C. Mahaffey, John Gamble and G. B. b
Zigler was appointed to secure an es
timate of the cost and report the re
sult at a special meeting next Mon
day. Mr. Mahaffey gave as his
opinion that Jennings could be made n
a river port at very small cost.
Other questions of interest were G
l scussedl. The ,vairious committees
are at work and good results for Jen
nings and Jefferson Davis parish are
expected from their efforts. C
The commercial committee reported t
plans for celebrating a Thanksgiving
Trade Day on the Saturday preced
ing Thanksgiving, the total expense 8
of conducting this celebration to be
met by the merchants. The move- e
ment was approved by a unanimous
vote of members present.
The Good Roads committee and the r
civic committee are considering plant.

construction through the parish from
the Mermentau river to the Calcasieu

way with palms from New Orleans to
California.
LATEST ELECTION RETURNS
New York, Nov. 10.--Prcsidcnt Wril
son- and Vice President iMarshall have
been e.p:ted Presalent and Vice
President of the United States. This
became certain late yesterday after
noon when returns from California
placed the Gold State in the democrat
ic column. Minnesota is still in doubt.
If it goes for the president it will only
swell his plurality. If it goes for
Hughes it cannot change the result.

BOOZE GETS BIG MAJORITY
FOR MEMBER SCHOOL BO.
The electini la1- 'i'ue iday de:el- ..
oped a considerable interest in the p;
two precincts of Ward Six, at Welsh tii
and Roanoke, due to the late announce
ment of opposition to the regular nom_
inee for member of the parish school
board. A few days before the elec- n
tion the insurrect;ionists brought out r;',
Mr. J. W. Narans in opposition to Mr. ''
J. M. Booze for member of the school if
board, thereby injecting a little local wa
interest into an election that would 1''!
otherwise have been very tu:me.
The Welsh precinct gave Mr. louze
94 votes and Mr. Narans 17; Roanoke
precinct, Booze 19, Narans 9; a total
in the ward for Mr. Booze 113, Nar
ans 26.
In the Welsh box there were 81
spoiled ballots and at Roanoke 30.
This was due to an unusual spiiting
of ballots and to the fact that the vot
ers had not enlightened themselves as
to the new clection laws. a pronmiscu
ous use of the lead pencil having
spoiled the majority of them.
There never was an election held
here wherein the commissioners ad
hered more closely to the letter of
the law.
Two hundred and two votes were
polled in this precinct; 78 stamped
the head of the democratic ticket,
voting for Wilson and Marshal, while
93 voted for the democratic electors.
Hughes and Fairbanks received 8
votes, 23 voting for the republican
elector! John M. parker did not
receive a single vote in this precinct,
a very peculiar incident considering
the hearty support accorded him by
the voters of this precinct a few
months ago. Three socialist votes
were cast, but two of them were
spoiled.
LAFAYETTE WILL VOTE
ON GOOD ROAD BONDS
The promoters of the latest idea in
good roads for Lafayette-that of do
ing away forever with the present
dirt roads by covering them with a
thick, firm layer of gravel--called on
the police jury Thursday afternoon
while the body was in regular month
ly session, and as a result the jurors
agreed to meet again in the 11th of
this month and act on the matter of
calling an election for a special tax
to pay for the work.
There is every indication that the
proposition will be pushed with the
characteristic energy of Lafayette
boosters. No sooner was the news of
the movement given out Thursday, as
it appeared in yesterday morning's
issue of the Press, than the first step
was taken to submit it to the people.
From what can be gathered by the
Press in conversation with citizens
from various sections of the parish,
it seems certain that the idea of
building permanent roads all over the
parish is acceptable generally and that
the proposed tax of five mills for
twenty years will be voted.
When the police jury issues the call
for the election, as no doubt that
body will, the promoters of the idea
will wage a campaign for the tax in (
every' ward; but, as said before, the '
sentiment of the people seems to be
so markedly in favor of the proposition
that a campaign will not be much
needed.-Lafayette Press.
