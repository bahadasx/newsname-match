candidates on the Republican county
ticket were snowed under and out-

' went down to defeat. Dr. J. D. Camp
' bell, who came out as an Independ
' ebt candidate for state senator, has
won over M. L. Lee, regular Repub
lican candidate, and W. T. Stewart,
Sr., the regular Democratic nominee,
the latter runing second in the way
of votes. For the legislative asemb
ly, C. W. Garrison defeated L. H.
Reason by about forty odd votes,
and will, therefore, be Lincoln coun
ty's representative In the lower
house of the next legislature at Car
son City. Beason carried nine pre
cincts in the county to a certainty,
but his lead in those places couit r.ot
overcome Garrison's vote In Pioche
where he received a majority of 68,
and where the influence of the
Women's Wilson club was felt in
local politics.
The three-cornered fight for sher
iff resulted In a victory for J. .
Nesbitt, regular Democratic nomi
nee. C. P. Christensen, who was
considered by many early in the cam
paign to have better chances t l an
. Nesbitt to win the Job, fell to sec
ond place, while Roy Orr, the Ro-
. publican, is close third in the race
according to the returns alreu'.v In.
. Ben Harris, who was the Pepubli-
. can nominee for county clerk, lost
to W. A. Denton of Callente, Demo
crat, who seems to have been a vote
getter nearly everywhere he vMit.
Chas. Culverwell, Democrat, was
re-elected county treasurer, defeat
ing Elmer B. Edwards, the Ropub
. lican nominee, by a big vote.
For auditor and recorder, Jennie
W. Wilcox was elected. Her oppon
ent was Ellis Riding of Callente and
her majority is the largest of any
of the successful candidates
lu the race for district . attorney,
a majority of the voters of .the coun
ty cast their ballots to sustain W.
E. Orr, Democrat. In fact, hiu op
ponent, T. J. Osborne, did not get
a look-in.
The long-term comlasionershlp,
as stated, was won by J. N. Hollinger
Republican, over Phil Mathews, of
Panaca.
Jim Ryan walked off with the
short-terra commisslonershlp, defeat-
ing Joe Delmue, Jr., by a narrow

THE FABLE OF THE
ACQUITTED SLAYER
Once there lived a member of the
Human Species. A brother said or
did something that suited Him not.
So He slew His brother. In the
eyes of what some call "The Law,"
He may or may not have been guilty;
before God he violated the Command
ment which reads; "Thou shalt not
kill!" He was ordered to Jail, pend
ing sucli time a3 He might have a
trial by a jury of His oeers. In
Oklahoma, a liberal State, one
charged with murder may be ad
mitted to bail by the Criminal Court
of Appeals, if there are specially ex
tenuating circumstances. But some
other places are more liberal, and
the aforesaid Jail chanced to be in
one of the aforesaid places. He was
not confined, excepting at night
when His brothers slept. During the
day. He was at liberty to roam about
meeting, greeting and conversing
with His brothers. He even succeed
ed in getting on the debit side of
the ledger with several merchants
about Town, who would naturally
prefer that some day He might be
able to cause a corresponding entry
to be made on the credit side. And,
generally speaking, He proves Him
self to be not such a bad felow after
all.
So when His peers were finally
asked to say "Guilty" or "Not
Guilty," having seen Him when He
was on His good behavior and hav
ing been duly impressed thereby,
being plastic like most members of
the human species land susceptible
to pity, His peers so said, one and all,
"He Is not guilty."
The following day another was

FOUR STATES ADDED
TO DRY COLUMN'
CHICAGO, Nov. 8. Oliver W.
Stewart, national prohibition cam
paign manager, this morning says:
"Returns Indicate that the drys have
added the four states of Michigan,
South Dakota, Nebraska and Mon
tana. Arkansas has also been saved
a sinking fund an amount sufficient
to retire all the bonds when they be
come due. The sinking fund is de
posited with banks and earns some
interest. This interest ordinarily is
only three per cent, where as the
county has to pay 5 or 6 per cent
to its bondholders. The serial plan
is a much, cheaper method for rais
ing money for road improvements,
even when the sinking fund earns in
terest as high as 4 per cent, and in
the opinion of the road specialists
of the department should be util
ized whenever it is possible to mar
ket serial bonds.
In a study of the road bond Iss
ues of several counties, J. E. Penny
backer and M. O. Eldridge, of the
division of road economics, office of
public roads and rural engineering,
found that the serial plan, if it had
been addopted by several counties,
would have saved the taxpayers in
one county $154,269, in another
county $S0,702, and in a third coun
ty $G5,367 over the other plan with
a sinking fund bearing Interest at
3 per cent. With a sinking fund
earning 4 per cent, the saving would
have run as high as $72,288 in one
of these counties. These conclusions
appear in the recently published
Department Bulletin 393, Econom
ic Surveys of County Highways and
Improvement
The following concrete examples
are taken from the bulletin.
"In Dallas county, Ala., the bonds
amounted to $350,000, payable in
30 years at 5 per cent. Assuming
the sinking fund to bear 3 per cent
interest, as set forth In the chapter
on Dallas county, the total financial
burden to the county for interest
and the liquidation of the bonds
during the 30-year period will be
$745,702.80. An equal amount of
bonds at the same rate of interest
if issued under the deferred serial
bond method, with the first bonds
6 years from the date of issuance
and an equal amount payable each
year thereafter for 24 years, would
cost the county at the end of the 30 '
years $665,000, or a difference, as
compared with the sinking-fund
method. of $80,702. If four per cenf
could be realized on the sinking fund
instead of 3 per cent, the saving for
the deferred serial plan over the
sinking fund plan would be $47,216,
"Lauderdale County, Miss., which
issued $500,000 of 5 and 5 per
cent bonds, adopted the deferred ser
ial-bond method, with the first pay
ment coming 11 years from the date
of issue and the last payment 25
years. If the county had issued the
bonds on the 5-25-year basis the
cost would have been $906,875, as
compared with the cost on the basis
adopted of $972,232, or a difference
of $65,367."
Even in the case of small Issue
the advantage of the serial plan is
Illustrated in Dinwlddie county, Va.

and 6 per cent bonds, payable in 30
years, but the bonds are called after
