Ntw York, Nov. 10. Taking the
unofficial count at its face value
there can be no doubt that Presi
dent Wilson has been re-elected.
The Republican national com-..
mittee does not consider the un
official count as final and presum
ably is planning contests or court

New York, Nov. 10. Former Justice
Hughes took the latest returns with
outward calmness today. Conflicting

he may delay in this until the count

San Francisco, Nov. 10. With 26
precincts missing Wilson is leading
with 3893 votes. This reduction was
caused by a correction in the report

however, will not change the result in
California.
The San Francisco Chronicle has

By United Press.
New York, Nov. 10. President Wil
son, apparently, has been elected with
out the votes which have hitherto been
supposedly indispensable those of the
states of Nevr York, Indiana and Illi
nois. He has seemingly won without
the aid of such leaders as Charles
Murphy, Taggart or Sullivan. The
concensus of opinion is that lean years
are ahead for all three of these chiefs
so far as federal patronage is concern
ed. It is apparent that the Progressives
threw most of their support 'to Wil

Statement
By United Press.
New York, Nov. 10. Republican
Chairman Wilcox today issued the fol
lowing statement:
The, result of the presidential elec
tion depends on a few close states. , It
must be borne in mind that the re
turns thus far announced in most
states are unofficial and may be
changed by official count. Twice dur
ing the unofficial computation in Cali
fornia mistakes lit addition were an
nounced substantally changing the fig
ures. Experience shows that the result of
the official count almost always varies
from returns first announced. Where
the race has been close there may be
! material changes. We owe It to the
country to see an honest count made.
When the current seemed to be Tun
ing against Wilson on Wednesday the
Democrats announced their Intention
to demand a recount. All that we de
sire is to be sure the vote has been
counted as cast.

One San Francisco paper claimed
that Hughes lost the state because he
ignored Johnson on his campaign trip.
A Wilson Victory,
tfy Onited Press.
New York, Nov. 10. America has
chosen Woodrow Wilson as president
and Marshall as vice president for
four more years, on the face .of the re
turns available this morning.
There is only the barest possibility
that a recount and court contests, as
predicted by unyielding Republicans,
may change the situation.
California's entire vote has not yet
been counted but Wilson's lead there
is so commanding that it appeared
that no matter what the result in tho j
few remaining precincts may be h I

Hughes. There remained, however, a
possibility of a division of that state's
electoral vote.
Counting California's entire vote for
Wilson, his total, electoral vote, it ap
peared this morning, had reached 2G9,
three more than necessary to elect.
Hughes had a total of 243. Three
states remained doubtful, ! Minnesota,
New Mexico and New Hampshire, but
their total of 19 votes would not be
sufficient to elect Hughes unless the
Republicans gained more than four
of California's votes on a split.
More than half of New Mexico's pre
cincts, reported up to 8 o'clock this
morning, gave Wilson a lead of more
than six thousand.
Republican headquarters here still
refused to concede Wilson's election.
Chairman Wilcox announced his deter
mination to press the recount of bal
lots in California, New Hampshire,
New Mexico, North Dakota and possi
bly Minnesota.

New York Nov. io. Tbe indications

a few representatives of independent

. As far as the Democrats and Repub

the returns, the Republicans made
such gains that the Democratic ma

even the speakership might be affect

the Republicans will have twd more
