Miss Betty Merrill Entertains.
Little Miss Betty Merrill was hos
tess for a delightful birthday party
on Monday afternoon, when she en
tertained about eighteen wee society
folk in honor of her third birthday
anniversary. When the birthday cake
was cut, little Ola Deare Vickers drew
the ring, and James Spencer, the
thimble. The cake was adorned with
three tiny green candles; and the ice
cream was in yellow and white de
sign. Dainty yellow baskets filled
with marshmallows were at each
plate a beautiful center-piece was
a vase of chrysanthemums.
Much amusement was afforded over
the efforts of the little ones in try
ing to pin the tail on the donkey, and
for this feat, John Warren Tilghman
was awarded the prize. The little
guests enjoyed every minute of the
afternoon.

On Ihe ('(truer
"Bob" James served breakfast in
the new Hotel James this morning.
Guests were received last night.
The new Hotel James is an advanc
ed conception in comfort for the trav
eling man. It has all the comforts
and elegance of a Fifth Avenue pal
ace hotel on a small scale, with mod
est Florida prices.
The cafe is large, airy, elegant; the
office ditto and then some. Here are
large leather reclining chairs and set
tees, and a great brick fire plcae that
reeks of Holland.
There are thirty-two sleeping
rooms, 16 on each floor. The 16 on
the second floor each have private !
oaths, the beds are the highest con
ception in style and comfort and each
room has a costly rug and other ar
tistic furnishings. On the third fbor
the rooms are just as fine and as fine
ly furnished, but they lack in private
baths, though each room has a sta
tionary lavatory with hot and cold
water, and there are toilets for gen
tlemen and ladies opening into the
centre hall.
The Hotel James is without doubt
the most delightful little hotel in all
Florida. And Mr. and Mrs. James
know how to keep it that way right
along.

To the Democrats of Putnam County:
Permit me to extend to you ray
most sincere thanks for the splendid
vote you pave me. By your vote you
have made me shentf of Putnam
County, and as such it is now incum
bent on me to prove myself worthy
ot your great trust ana conntience.
We have gone through a most unu
sual campaign, the like of which I
have never before witnessed. This
campaign has put the Democrats to
a real test. To those who stood the
test and faithfully supported the nom
inees, the greatest credit is due.
There has never been a time within
the history of the Democratic party
when a real test came, that there were
not true and loyal men to stand by
the party and hold it together. It is
likewise true that in such case I am
sorry to say there are some desert
ers. Just how people can participate
in a Democratic primary and then re
pudiate the nominees of the party
when they are not to their liking, is
more than I can understand. This,
however, is a matter left to the con
science of the voter. When he enters
the voting booth secrecy protects him,
ami then and there the real test of
manhood comes. If he is a true man,
he will support the nominees, but if
he recognizes no moral obligation,
then he will disregard the nominees
ai:c! vote for the man of his choice,
legardless of the previous action of
himself and his fellow Democrats jn
the primary. Personally I am greatly
pleased with the great majority I re
ceived, and I am most grateful to all
who voted for me, but it is quite
ipparent that many democrats who
voted in the primary, did not support
the nominees, but supported T.vJepen 1
er.ts and Republicans in the general
election. This I do not consider givi s
the Democratic party or its nominees
a square deal, and I think such action
does violence to real manhood, Demo
cratic doctrines, and square dealing.
Of course I am interested in myself,
but having been a Democrat all of
my life, I am interested in the Demo
cratic party, the principles and gov
ernment for which it stands. I should
like to see the party upheld, but if
Democrats continue to participate in
the primary and then at the general
election vote for Independents and
Republicans, the primary will soon be
come a farce, confusion will reign in
the ranks of the party and complete
disruption will follow.
I should like to see all Democrats
forget the many unpleasant features
of the recent primary and general
election, and come together as a reu
nited party and work for the hest in
terests of the City, County, State and
Nation. It is quite painful to me to
see Democrats divided and righting
one another at the general election.
Let us get together, improve by the
past, be friends, and look hopeful to
the future.
I shall to the utmost of my abaility
faithfully discharge my duties toward
the people, regardless of differences
or political case.
Thanking you again, I am
Most gratefully yours,
P. M. HAGAN.
That there will be a large attend
ance at the national convention of the
Farmers Educational and Cooperative
Union of America which meets in Pa- j
latka November 21-24 is now certain.
Special rates have been arranged by '
the Southeastern Passenger Associa-
tion for all the Southeastern terri-
tory and reports are that the attend- j
ance from the Southern states will be
largely in excess of the regular dele
gates. Special excursion rates from
all points in Florida are also being ar
ranged and there is no doubt but that
Palatka will have the largest crowd
of visitors in her history.
Every home in the city must be
opened to our guests in order to
care for all who are coming, and it is
more than likely that many will have
to seek accomodations in nearby
towns. In anticipation of this Has
tings has sent word to the Palatka
Board of Trade that they can take
care of eight persons. This is wel
come news as there is no doubt that
these accommodations will be needed.
Owing to the lack of excursion
boats on the St. Johns river and the
fact that the City of Jacksonville
broke a shaft last week there has
been some delay in completing ar
rangements for the boat trip for the
entertainment of the delegates, but
Chairman Leeks of the Entertainment
Committee is determined to provide
the excursion if it is within the pos
sibilities of the resources at hand.
Less than two weeks remain before
the meeting of the convention. The
local unions of the Farmers Union
have not as vet shown that interest in
the coming of their brothers that
thev should show. We know that
these are busy days of preparation
for their winter crops, but there is a
civic duty and a fraternal duty as
well that must be performed by the
members of the Farmers Union in
this county. They cannot allow it to
go by default. However willing any
one else may be to assume this duty,
the farmers of Putnam county cannot
afford to have any one else discharge
this dutv for them. The City of Pa
latka is to entertain members of their
family who are coming here from
creat distances. Many of them will
feel that they are coming into a
strange country, but they have been
told that they are coming to a sec
tion where the Union is flourishing.
Thev should not be disappointed.
New Florida.
EW PflSIOFRCE 10
OPEN DECEMBER SECOND
PnstniMstor Harrv Grav says that
Palatka's new postoffice will be open
for business on Saturday, December
:2nd.
The contractor is now putting on
the finishing touches, and is placing
the fixtures on the interior. The
furnishings have not arrived but are
expected daily.
On the opening day Postmaster
Gray, who is feeling pretty well him
self over the election returns, and
like a good neighbor is spending some
time each day consoling the true and
tried republican who had set his heart
on succeeding him, says he will hold
a reception for the people of Palatka,
a time when they all will be invited
to come in and inspect the new build
ing. He will serve ice cream or
punch, or both, and to some of the
disappointed politicians he will hand
a cigar.
Palatka's new postoffice is a dream
in architicural beauty, and is as
solid as the everlasting hills. It was
built to stand the storms of ages.
It is light, airy, well ventilated, with
lofty ceilings. It has modern heat
;v,ir nnH lirrhtine- arrangements and
is arranged scientifically for the eco-
nomic handling of the incoming and
i outgoing mails.
! The postmaster has a fine private
office in the southwest corner of the
ruilding. Here the furniture will be
of mahogany with a swivel, reclining
chair and an oriental rug with a
! prayer device for the postmaster s
use in times of stress.
"A special to The Palatka News at
(5 o'clock this morning says that Wil
son has carried California by a plu
rality of nearly 3,000 and that this
gives him 2(9 votes in the electorial
college, or three more than a ma
jority. The Republican managers
have conceded the President's election.
Minnesota, New Mexico and West
Virginia are still doubtful with the
chances favoring their going to swell
the President s vote.
It is known that the new Senate
will be Democratic and that the
House will be close, though the
chances favor its being Democratic
by about 10.
New Hampshire's four electorial
votes will go to Wilson; figures re
ceived during the morning of Thurs
day gave him a lead of 93 votes.
Henry Morgenthau, temporarily in
charge of democratic headquarters,
said that a demand would be made
for a recount in New Hampshire in
spite of this lead and added that
democratic figures show that Wilson
has a lead of over 500.
CUTIS WINS GOVERNORSHIP BY
A dispatch from Jacksonville to
The News at one o'clock Thursday
stated that
All counties in the State election
with the exception of Calhoun have
been heard from either complete or
practically complete, and the election
of Sidney J. Catts, of DeFuniak
Springs, as the next Governor of
Florida by a majority ranging from
7,500 to 10,000 is definitely assured.
The vote in Florida, in spite of the
unusual interest manifested in the
campaign, apparently was not as
great as that cast in the June pri
mary election, when something over
80,000 votes were cast. The returns
up to a late hour this morning ac
counted for something over 63,000
votes and of those Catts was leading
by over 7,000 votes.
At least two Democratic nominees
for the House of Representatives
appear to have been defeated. The
candidate who secured the nomination
in Clay county has apparently been
defeated by former Representative
Mann, Independent. Another county
apparently has defeated its primary
nominee for the House of Representatives.
IT ORANGE SPRINGS
Will Have More than Two
Hundred Individual
Exhibitors.
The Colonists Fair of the Florida
Farms and Homes, Inc., at Orange
Springs Friday and Saturday Nov.
24 and 25 will be a great success.
This is an assured fact. The great
number of entries already filled, and
the character of the exhibits which
range all the way from registered
bulls to Belgian hares in live stock
and include every kind of agricultural
prod ct and almost every thing in the
way of woman's skill in the kitchen
and handicraft with the needle, leave
no room for doubt as to the wide
spread interest that is taken in the
fair.
Many merchant and manufacturers
have expressed a determination to
take advantage of this opportunity to
bring their wares to the attention of
iha crowds that will be in attendance.
That there will be a large attendance
is certain. With fully two hundred
individual exhibitors, no entrance fees,
and no charges for admission the fair
has resolved itself into a great big
family gathering for the people with
in the territory of the Florida Farms
and Homes, Inc.
It was President Murphy's intention
when he sent out a call for dele
gates to organize a fair association
last April to bring about a spirit of
cooperation among all the people to
develop the territory between Talat
ka and Ocala and from the Georgia
Southern and Florida Railway to the
Ocklawaha River. That he has suc
ceeded beyond lhi expectations (is
apparent from the number and variety
of the exhibits and the enthusiasm
which is shown in the progress of the
fair.
Fortune seems to have favored the
event. No one dreamed that the Na
tional Convention of the Farmers Ed
ucational and Cooperative Union of
America would be held in Palatka
when this fair was conceived. It
is well for this section of the state
that a representative display of its
agricultural products should have
been arranged so far in advance of
the notice of the convention that it
will prove a most instructive lesson
to the two thousand or more visitors
who will visit Palatka the same week
as that in which the fair will be
held.
County Returns Not Tabulated.

legular nominees were elected by the

and was elected. Mr. Rogero received
284 votes. Mr. Stephens was elected
