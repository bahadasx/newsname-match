Chairman Jacobs Writes Interesting
Article Showing Present
Status of Enterprise?Of
Great Interest to the People

" ft
Mr. Reid Tull, chief engineer of the
Carolina Rapid Transit Company, has
just finished the field work in the
survey, and begins the office work in
the preparation of the engineering
report, collection of commercial data,;
etc., this week. Two lines and in
some cases three liifes have been run,
with a view to the final adoption of
the most feasible route, measured in
the light of the cost of construction,
cost of operation, the mileage and the
degree of cooperation given by the
people on the competing lines, the plan
being to connect Spartanburg, Union,
Laurens and Clinton by a rapid electric
transit system for freight and
Pqq son fforo
Mr. Tull advises that the cost of
this line fully equipped, built in an
A-l manner with maximum grade of
1 per cent and maximum curvature of
degrees, heavy rail, heavy overhead
construction, first class, 60 feet express
cars and heavy electric engines
for the freight service will be about
$50,000.00 per mile. The mileage is
about 62 miles, so that the actual cost
of construction and equipment will be
upwards of $3,000,000.00, exclusive of
any possible power development which
may be involved in the proposition.
Mr. Tull is much pleased with the
character of the country traversed
and with the volume of business evidently
to be had for such a title. The
actual facts and figures of the cost
of operation, cost of construction,
likely income, gross and net, will not
develop until engineering and comThe
engineering corps has had in
charge the securing of rights of way,
' and fully 95 per cent of the rights of
way are already in hand. In a few
instances there has been a lack of cooperation.
and such instancAa nw>
likely to work greatly to the disadvantage
of the line of survey on
which they occur. This road is a
people's road. It is to be built by
the people of Spartanburg, Union and
Laurens counties if it is to be built
at all. Hence, any lack of cooperation
of the people on the line in any
part of the line is not only discouragement
to the development as a
whole, but will also likely injbre the
community in which the opposition
develops by diverting the line from
that comrtiunity into some other.
The line will no doubt be located
where the largest cooperation is developed,
for in nearly all cases the
competitive surveys are pretty well
balanced as regards cost of construction
and cost of operation. Hence, it
will be largely a question of the degree
of cooperation afforded by the
people along a given line as to whether
the railroad will be built along that
line or not. By cooperation is meant
free rights of way, fee town sites, extensive
subscriptions to cajpital stock,
etc.
It becomes more and more clear
that the people of the three counties
are going to build the line, but it is
not certain along what line of survey
it will be built. Hence, it will be
greatly to the interest of the people
on or near any of t^e lines of survey
to put forth their extremest enedeavor
tA tlin :u1
n..v v..u umiucsv punaimc cooperation
to those who have the matter in
charge; that is, if they care to converse
their own interests, as well as
advance the interest of their county.
The subscriptions made to the expenses
of survey and the initial expenses
of organization have only been
paid in in part. There remains to be
collected considerable sums in Spartanburg,
Union, Glenn Springs, Cedar
Springs, Cross Anchor, Walnut Grove,
West Springs and Laurens. Only two
points have paid their* subscriptions
complete, Tylersville and Clinton.
The funds in hand will pay the
expehses of the engineering corps for
about one month further. Hence, it
is extremely desirable that the boards
of trade and public spirited citizens in
the above mentioned communities
; which are still short on their collections
get busy at once and collect up
the entire volume of funds subscribed,
placing same to the credit of the Carolina
Rapid Transit Company Board
of Corporators. It la likely that the
engineering and commercial reports

BURIAL OF SERGEANT
BLALOCK SUNDAY
Large Concourse of People Gather to
Pay Tribute to Dead Soldier.
Floral Tributes Beautiful.
Fully a thousand people gathered
Sunday morning at 11 o'clock to attend
the burial of Sergeant J. I. Blalock,
who died in El Paso, Texas, the
previous Tuesday. The remains reached
Union Saturday accompanied by
Sergeant J. A. Hollingsworth. The
exercises were held in Unity Methodist
church, and were conducted by
Rev. J. H. Brown, who is himself a
veteran of the Spanish-American war.
Onlv a small nart of tVio immnnoo
throng of people who attended the
burial could get into the building.
The floral tributes were exceedingly
many and were very beautiful.
Among these was one from Co. E, the
Johnson Rifles, which was a large U.
S. flag, made of white and red roses
and blue flowers, thus having the three
colors, red, white and blue. The spectators
in Excelsior Knitting Mill, sent
a large wheel, from which one spoke
was missing. The U.. D .C. chapter
and the D. A. R. chapter sent beautiful
floral tributes ,as did many individuals.
The body was laid to rest in Rosemont
cemetery, the Woodmen and the
Junior Order of American Mechanics
having charge of the exercises.

Result of Electioi
From C
New York, Nov. 9.?With the f
returns showing the closest
presidential election since the 8
memorable year of 1892, Wood- c
row Wilson and Charles E. t
Hughes at midnight tonight e
were running neck and neck for
the presidency. The returns j
from the East Indiana, Illinois r
and Iowa had early overcome j
the majorities piled up for Wil- j
son in the solid South and at c
midnight, after a day of tense j
watching of the dispatches, the ^
fate of the election hinged on j,
the way Minnesota and Cali- g
fornia should go. g
At midnight President Wil- f
son had a total of 232 sure votes, ?
with 19 more nearly sure?from
Idaho, Washington, and Ne- t
braska?bringing his total up to ?]
251. Mr. Hughes had a virtual s
certainty of 239, with the prob- a
able vote of West Virginia y
bringing his total up to 247. c
California with its 13 votes j
and Minnesota with its even c
dozen seemed then the pivotai y
points, though North Dakota
with five and New Mexico with
three threatened at any time to y
come to the front as important c
factors in the decision of the ^
race. x
California or Minnesota and a
North Dakota and New Mexico r
would reelect President Wilson;
California and New Mexico or ^
California and Minnesota, or
Minnesota and New Mexico, c
with the five from North Da- c
kota would elect the Republican
nominee. ^

orged ahead in that State.
Throughout the day the manigers
of both candidates had
laimed victory as certain and
here was no concession by eithr
side.
In New Hampshire, which the
Republicans on the face of the
eturns carried by 161 votes, the
Democrats will ask a recount,
n West Virginia, the Republian
candidate seems to have a
ead which will pull him through.
Vashington, Idaho and Nebraska,
on incomplete returns, all
rive pluralities to Wilson which
teemed to point to their being
inally returned as Democratic
>tates.
The sudden change in the statis
of the election, which early
ruesday night had assumed
tomething of the proportions of
i Republican landslide, was due
othe great strength of the Democrats
in the West and on the
5acific slope. At present, the
'.lection seems to be in doubt berond
the point of prediction.
California this morning show;d
a lead for the president and
us campaign managers were
laiming it by at least 15,000.
