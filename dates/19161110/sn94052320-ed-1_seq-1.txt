The Pineapple and tha Bee
By William Cowper ,
The pineaplea, in triple row,
Were basking hot, and alt in blow;
A bee of most deserving taste
Perceived the fragrance as he paaa'd,
On eager wing the spoiler came.
And aearch'd for crannies In th frame.
Urged his attempt from every aide,
To every-pane his trunk applied;
But atill in vain, tha frame was tight,
And only pervious to tha light:
Thus having wasted half the day.
Ho trimm'd hia flight another way.
Methinks, I said, in thee I find
The ajn and madness of mankind. ,.; ;
To joys forbidden man aspires,
Consumes his soul with vain desires;
Folly the spring of his pursuit,
And disappointment all the fruit.
While Cynthio ogles, as she passes,
The nymph between two chariot
glusses, -She
is the- pineapple, and he
The silly unsuspecting bee.
The maid who views with pensive air
Tha showglnss fraught with glittering
ware, "
Sees watches, ' bracelets, rings and
lockets,
Buaaigh3 at thought of empty pockets;
Like thine her appetite ia keen,
But, ah, the cruel glass between!
Our deer delights ara often auch, ,
Exposed to view, but not to touch;
The sight our foolish heart inflames,
We long for pineapples in frames;
With hopeless wish one looks and
lingers; .
Ona breaks the glass, and cuts hia
fingers; . .
But they whom truth and wisdom lead,
Can gather honey from a weed.
THE TOWN PAPER
George A. Starring of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin says; ,
"The average local town paper is
worth thousands of dollars annually
to ita community for the free service
it renders. As a constant booster and
promoter of local news or information
it is indispensable.
"Did you ever atop to think what
you would do without your home pap
er? This is not an .idle question.
What would you do if your town paper
should indefinitely suspend publica
tion? '"'r:-,; v"
1 "W have to have our town news
paper. We want to know what other
folks in the country are doing. The
most interesting information in . the
world ia knowledge of what other peo
ple are doing. Let's help our com
munity by helping our local editor in
his work. We cannot dispense with
hia service. On the other hand, he
needs more of our moral and material
support."
Constantly boosting for Hs homa
town, the Ilermiston Herald reports
in its current issue that there is" but
one vacant house in Hermiston, and
that "never before at this period of
the school year have the Hermiston
achoola had so larg. aa enrollment,
