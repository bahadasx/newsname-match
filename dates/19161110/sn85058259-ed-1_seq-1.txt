SWEEPING DEMO-
CRATIC VICTORY,
-m Election Proves a Very One
sided Qne in County, State
and Nation.
EVERY NOMINEE ON
COUNTY TICKET WINS
Vote on Presidential Nominees Ex
tremely Close. But Finally (liven
to Wilson and Mai shall.
Telephone communication from Sail
H Lake City today conveys the confirm
ation of the election of Wnodrow Wil
son and T. R. Marshall us president
and vice-president of the I'nited
States, thus completing the sweeping
victory of the Democratic party.
Not since Utah became a state has
the Democratic party achieved such
a signal victory in state, county and
nation as was trained at the election
last Tuesday. Every nominee on the
Democratic ticket in Iron County, in
the State of Utah, and their presiden
tial candidates have been elected, for
the most part with large pluralities,
except in the matter of the presiden
tial candidates. Not a single Repub
lican in Iron county or on the judiciul
or state tickets got by. It is a clean
sweep for the democrats, who, in Ce
dar City, are preparing for what they
claim will be the biggest celebration
ever held in Cedar City. Next Mon
day night is the date fixed for this
explosion of feeling, and while the
program has not yet been announced,
we are authorized to state that it will
be the event of the season. We are
further advised that it will be open to
members of all creeds and parties.
We are just advised that the eele-
....-- - - -brat ou.. will be in the form of a barbe
cue at I p. m., followed by a dance in
f the Ward Hall at night.
On this page will be found the com
plete tabulated vote of Iron county by
precincts, so far as it has been obtain
able, and while it is subject to correc
tion by the County Commissioners
when they meet to canvass the re
turns, we feel sufe in saying that no
changes will be made in the result,
so far as the election of nominees is
concerned. For the next two years,
at least, we will have a complete Dem
ocratic administration of county af
fairs, with the single exception of
the Republican hold-over county com
missioner, H. W. Lunt.
This will be something entirely new
for Iron county, which has heretofore
always held a substantial Republican
I majority, and its officers have, there-
- fore, for the most part been Republi-
cans.
The vote on the presidential nom
inees was exceedingly close, it finally
devolving upon the state of California
to cast the deciding votes.
The Democrats, of course, are jubi
lant over their victory, and the Re
publicans, while disappointed at the
results, are for the most part taking
defeat stoically and philosophically,
believing that there are other and bet
ter days in store for them.

Douglas hite and Party Return
Full of Praise for Southern
Ftah Scenic Attractions.
Last week Mr. Douglas White and
party returned from the Little ion
Canyon, Washington county, and their j
trip of exploration through the Cedar
canyon and over the Cedar and Kan
arra mountains over to the brink of
the Little Zion.
Seen by a representative of this pa
per, Mr. White spoke enthusiastically
of the I ( nery that they beheld on the
trip, and said that it was sure at some
tune in the future to receive the prom
inence which it so richly deserves, as
one of the greatest scenic features in
the entire United States. Mr. White
did not believe, however, that it was
practical at this time to link the Cedar
Canyon and the brink of Little Zion
with a good automobile road; but stat
ed that the entire section was certain
to receive recognition in the near fu
ture. Mr. White also stated, or reiterated
u former statement to the effect that
his company would expend ten dollars
in advertising the scenery of this lo
cality for every one dollar that the
people, the state of Utah and the na
tional government would give towards
the improvement of the road, and the
construction of a good auto highway
by which to reach these beauties of
nature.
State Engineer Beers, who was also
a member of the party, shared Mr.
White's opinion as to the feasibility of
reaching Little Zion from the top via
the Cedar Canyon, but stated that a
satisfactory route could be obtained
farther south, and both gentlemen
were enthusiastic in relation to the
scenery that would be opened to the
tourist along this route.
The party was in the hills for nearly
a week and came back wearing splen
did growths of whiskers, and looking
as if they had certainly been roughing
it in every sense that the term implies.
Mr. White has promised to furnish
The Record some good cuts illustrat
ing some of the wonderful scenery
through which his party passed, and
these will appear in a subsequent is
sue of this paper.

PROHIBITION AND
CRIMINAL CLASS:
Warden of Colorado State Prison
Gives Out BosM Interesting
Facts and Comparisons.
Regarding the effect of the prohi
bition law on crime condition in Colo
rado, I wish to say that the effect of
the law was not perceptible at this
institution until the first of March, on
account of the fact that the jails con
tained so many men who were waiting
trial for crimes committed previous
to January 1st.
On March I the institution contain
ed 827 inmates. On account of the
paroling and discharging of prisoners
at the end of their sentence, we find
that our count today is about 703, with
HO more to be released during the next
month. Regarding the receipt of
prisoners will say that we are receiv
ing only one this year where we were
receiving three last year or about that
ratio.
I find upon investigation that all of
the county jails are empty or nearly
SO) except in the thickly populated
centers and even in these cases, the
number is only one-third of what it
usually has been for years past when
we had open saloons in Colorado. The
following is a table, giving the statis
tics regarding this institution and
which will undoubtedly be of bene-1
fit to you. Prisonesr received? Pa-1
rolcd and discharged, during the
months of May, June, July, August j

One of the most advantageous fea-,
tares that I notice in regard to the
prohibition law is that the influx of !
the bad element from the outside of
the state has decreased very percept
ibly on account of the saloons being
closed. My experience has been that
crooks, yeggmen, black-mailers, pick
pockets, burglars and pimps all con
gregate in the booze and red light dis
tricts and I think the police of all the
cities of Colorado will bear me out
when I say that this class is passing
up Colorado and are not coming into
the state as formerly, while on the
other hand, it will be fojnd that the
percentage of these people in New
Mexico and Wyoming has increased
very materially. Seventy per cent of
all the men who formerly came to this
institution were non-residents of the
state of Colorado. Kansas has twice
the population of Colorado, yet their
penitentiary contained fewer men
than Colorado's up to January 1st. To
my mind it proves that the bad ele
ment passed up the state of Kansas
largely and came into Colorado,
understanding is that the state of
Kansas largely and came into Colo
My understanding is that the
expects to go into farming on the
with this bad element since the sa
loons closed in this state.
Furthermore, I have observed that
the habitual criminals or men who
constantly returned to this institution
each time after their sentences were
served men whom we required to
serve their maximum sentences on
account of their being repeaters left
the state after their discharge this
year and have not returned to this in
stitution ns they formerly did. But
I do find that a number of these men I
have landed in the Wyoming peniten
tiary, proving unquestionably that
these men left Colorado and went to
states where the saloons were open.
SEES GREAT OPPORTUNITIES
IN IRON CO. AGRICULTURE.
Mr. T. II. Glaze of Los Angeles,
California, who has purchased 320 of
the Ernest land near Summit, and has
the management of 320 acres more for
his niece, has taken up his residence
in Iron county and will probably make
his permanent home here. Mr. Glaze
has also Required the Hackney tractor
formerly owned by Mr. Gregory, and
expects to go into farming on the
newly acquired hind on a large scale.
Mr. Glaze, who is accompanied by
his wife, owns a large ranch in Nevada
and has had B large amount of ex
perience in farming and ranching, but
says that in his opinion this section of
Iron county affords the best opportun
ities for this class of investment of
any section in the West with which he
is acquainted.
Mr. Glaze drives a Series 17 four
cylinder Btudsbaksr car, and says that
for a country such as this he knows
of no car regardless of price that can
equal it. In making the trip here from
Los Angeles over the Lincoln High
way, Mr. Glaze states that they en
countered a great deal of mud, and
that something iiks 1 1 care of various
makes were passed fast in the clay,
but that his Studebaksr made it
through on its own power,
We are pleased to have men such
as Mr Glaze take up their residence
among us, as it means u decided im
petus to the dcveiopawmt of this- pwl
I of the country.

Following is the unofficial and somewhat incomplete vote of Iron County in
tho recent election, so far as it has been obtainable. The following table shows H
only the Democratic and Republican vote. There was a light sprinkling of Social- 4H
ist votes in some of the precincts in other, theiv were none; but as it was impos- LH
sible to get the entire Socialist vote, we have omitted it entirely from the following H
table. When the complete election returns have been canvassed by the Board of
County Commissioners, we will try to give the complete official vote for the county.

Getting Over the Road.
The Studebaker cars are in no sen.ie
racing cars. They arc well construct- H
ed, and only the best of material is IH
used, but they are intended for serv-
ii-.- in all kinds of exacting conditions, fH
being especially adapted to country bbbBb!
roads. But to show that they are HH
capable of even good speed perform- H
.ince when put to the test, is proven B
by the time made between St. George flfsal
arid Cedar City by R. T. Mitchell, as- 9fl
sistant manager of the Salt Lake of- Lfl
flee and R. P. Bowman, supervisor of ILbbbV
the service department, in a six-cylin- H
der Series 17 touring car last week. H
The drive was not made against time, H
or with a view to establishing any H
new record for performance, but was IH
mentioned by the gentlemen as Ixing H
rather good time, considering the con- H

of Dixie was covered in two hours and H
