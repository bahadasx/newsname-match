NUMBER 28
WILSON RE ELECTED PRESIDENT
COUNTY GOES
REPUBLICAN
PRACTICALLY ALL COUNTY OF
FICERS ON TICKET
ELECTED.
Several close races marked the elec
tion in the county, and many of the
results were in doubt until the returns
of practically all the precincts had
been brought in.
With the largest vote ever polled in
the county, and with the women cast
ing their first ballot for President,
the outcome was doubtful until the
votes had been counted. The sur
prises were many and the number of
split tickets voted shows that there
were only a few who voted it
"straight."
Wilson carried the county over
Hugjhes with a plurality of 901 votes j
in 2.1 out of the 31 precincts, and My-1
C. W. Powell, Sheriff-Elect
ers, democrat leads Pray in the coun
ty with 717 votes. Evans and Ran
kin received the highest number of
votes for congress, with Mitchell third
and Farr fourth. Governor Stew
art has a lead of 38 votes in the pre
cincts heard from. The rest of the
Republican state ticket were given
good pluralities in the county.
The largest vote polled by any can
didate in the county was that of John
Hurly, candidate for Judge of the dis
trict court. His majority in the
•county will be over 1400 votes. In
the city of Glasgow alone, Hurly's
lead over his opponent was over 800
votes, and the returns from the coun
try precincts only piled up his ma
jority.
W. W. Hurd was elected State Sen
ator over R. J. Moore, Republican by
about 300 votes, and Valley County's
legislative ticket will be composed of
Sands, (Dem.), Phelps (Rep.), and
Sektnan (Dem.). McGovern is close
on the heels of Sektnan, but it is
doubtful if he can overcome the lat
ter's lead.
In the race for county commissioner
Carl Anderson is leading Mead by 97
votes, with the precincts of Richland,
Tande and Coal Creek *,o hear from.
His election is practically assurred,
although the last named precincts may
reduce his plurality. Julius Waber
defeated O. W. Phelps for the unex
pired term.
The fight for the Clerk and Record
er's office was a three cornered affair,

Senator W. W. Hurd
Shoemaker, Arnot and Hanson run-'
ning neck and neck, but in the last
stretch, Shoemaker nosed out his op-]
ponents and is undoubtedly a winner.
Powell came near defeating Baylor!
two to one and Ben Cottrell was re
elected assessor over J. R. Puckett.
Carl D. Borton is the next county at
torney and Miss Nellie Johonnott came
out victor over Miss Grace Remore.
Mann remains in office for another
two years as county surveyor winning
over Walker by about 300 votes.
Prohibition carried in the county by
a large vote, the city of Glasgow go-!
ing two to one in favor of it.
Among some of the surprises of
the election were the defeat of Dan
McGovern for the legislature and of
L. P. Evans for justice of the peace.
The new justice for this township will
be G. H. Kampfer. |
The returns from 27 of the 31 pre
cincts of the county show the fol
lowing results. The precincts still
rnissin^r are Richland, Tande and Coal
Creek, but even though their vote
should be very one sided, they will
not change the results.

CALIFORNIA'S THIRTEEN VOTES GO TO WILSON,
DECIDING ELECTION FOR PRESIDENT.
SAM V. STEWART RE
ELECTED GOVERNOR
leads edwards by 7,000 and his election is as
sured. Mcdowell leading annin for
lieutenant governor.
. .
' S completed,
Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States
when California swung definitely into the Democratic column.
The only states where the result remained in question were Min
nesota, New Hampshire, and New Mexico, with 19 electoral votes.
Unless there is a decided overturn in the districts missing, Wilson
will carry New Mexico. Hughes is leading in Minnesota. The
result will not be known in New Hampshire until the official count
West Virginia, which was classed as doubtful, has
gone definitely for Hughes.
With practically all the state returns in. Governor Stewart
has been re-elected with a plurality of about 7,000.
Henry l. Myers defeated Charles N. Pray for the Senate,
while Evans and Miss Rankin will represent Montana in the lower
, , ,,
house of Congress.
McDowell is conceded the election for Lieutenant-Governor
over J. B. Annin.
Brantly, Republican, has undoubtedly won out over Patterson,
* )emocrat for Justice of the Supreme Court.
Ford, Republican, has a big lead over Poindexter for
Attorney General, and his election is practically certain.
Hart, Republican has won out over Farrel for State Treasurer.
Keating. Democrat, leads Fenner, Republican, but returns
f rom missing counties may change the result.
r»„ • i » « r. ....
i Daniel Boyle, Republican was elected Railroad Commissioner
over Johnson
Carrol, Democrat, leads Craig, Republican by about 1,000
votes.
Miss Trumper won an easy victory Miss O'Donnell, her plur
ality being estimated at 15,000 votes.
The vote on prohibition, with most of the counties heard from
was closer than expected, there being 31,601 for and 28,309 against.
With a majority of about 2400 votes,
John Hurly of Glasgow was elected
judge of the District Court of the
Seventeenth Judicial District by the
electors of the counties of Valley,
Sheridan and Phillips, Tuesday.
Running far ahead of his ticket and
in many instances receiving the most
votes cast for any one candidate in a
precinct, his big vote is a striking
tribute from the people of the three
counties. He was populay from the
start, and the press and people voice
the sentiment that he will make the
best judge the district has ever had.
In Glasgow alone John Hurly was
given a majority of over 800 votes and
he carried the county by 1400. Phil
lips county went "Hurly" by 600 votes
anl Sheridan county, the home of his
opponent, gave Mr. Hurly a lead of
about 400.
Judge Huriy, if you please.
DELEGATION TO CARNIVAL
At a meeting of the Montana Cham
ber of Commerce held in September
the plan of conducting a special Mon
tana train to participate in the events
of the St. Paul Outdoor Sports Car
nival Association was discussed and
it was decided to invite the co-opera-1
tion of the commercial clubs in scour-,
ing representatives to take advantage
of this spectacular event.
Enough interest is already aroused
Northern Montana to assure a spe
cial train of fine equipment which will
leave Great Falls, January 25th. It
is probable that other portions of
the state will arrange specials.
The carnival officers announce that
the celebration will be on a grander
and more magnificent scale than the
last one. Pendleton, Spokane, and
other western cities will send dele- j
gâtions and if Montana will do like-!
wise it will bring this state before j
thousands of people, a3 the adver
tising and publicity given the coming
carnival will be extraordinary.
CO. "G"
BOYS ENTERTAINED
AT THE COLEMAN
Fourteen boys, members of Company
"G" were entertained for supper at
the Coleman Hotel aa guests of S. C.
Moore, the new manager on Saturday
evening.
The original plan was to
have had the boys at breakfast but
owing to the delay in their arrival this
plan was given up and a supper serv
ed instead.
A large table was arranged in the
center of the dining room for the boy«
so that they might "mess" together.
At the re(1U est of Sarg. Bill Beizer

MRS. SPELLETICH DIES
Mrs. Adam Spelletich, wife of Adam
Spellitch, former residents of Glas
gow, died on Wednesday, November
first, at Menominee, Wisconsin, after
a lingering illness of about four years.
Mrs. Spelletich before her marriage
was Mildred King. She was born in
Menominee, on March 25th 1884, and
was married to Adam F. Spelletich
on January 12th, 1905. After their
marriage they moved to Glasgow
where Mr. Spelletich engaged in busi- j

Mr. Spelletich is still in business:
here. The sympathy of the many >
Glasgow people who know them, is
extended to the family. .

WIRES DOWN IN STORM j
A severe blizzard raging Thursday
near Great Falls had a bad effect upon
telegraph and telephone wires and sev
eral lines running out of the Falls
were put out of commission. Tele-^
graphic reports of the election were
curtailed to a great extent ajid for a
time Glasgow had no means of getting
any news to or from the outside world.
Reports stated that many wires were
also down between Shelby and Havre.
YOUNG FARMER KILLED
Harry Bonnes, the 18 year old son
of Joseph Bonnes, a farmer living four
miles south of Scobey was found dead,
wedged in the shafting of the grain
elevator, located inside the barn, last
week.
The- boy's death was due to an ac
cident, having been caught between the
belt and pulley of the elevator shaft.
"COULDN'T THROW THE BULL"
Policeman Dan Mitchell was badly
shaken up and slightly braised about
the head and face Sunday when thrown
from a horse. He was roping steers
in the pasture south of the railroad,
when his horse, an unusually gentle
animal, shied, and threw Dan. His'
glasses were broken and his head and
'ose were bruised.—Poplar Standard
FIRE EXTINGUISHER
PROTECTS THRESHERS
Washington, Nov. 7.—An automatic
fire extinguisher to prevent losses
from explosions and fires due to grain
dust in threshing machines has been
invented by experts of the depart
ment of agriculture and will be pat
ented for the benefit of the public. A
considerable number of fires have been
reported this season in New York
state and some have occurred in
Oregon, Washington and Idaho. In
the east these explosions have been
costly as threshing operations usual
ly are carried on in barns and fires
result in heavy damage. Working
drawings of the automatic fire ex
tinguisher will be furnished by the de
partment of agriculture to grain
growers, thresher owners and operat
ors upon application.
LARGE SALE OF STATE LAND
Following the recent sale of state
land in Beaverhead and Madison
counties at good prices the sum con
tracted for in state land sales
Montana has reached a total of nearly
two million dollars and land amount
ing to 126,861 acres has been contract
ed for since the first of the year, ac
cording to figures compiled by State
Register of Lands Sidney Miller. The
actual sum for the sales is $1,992,
081.84, or a general average of $11.70
an acre.
The sale of state land shows the
advance of agricultural Montana as
the land sales are not pushed by the
board but sales are held only when
applications are made and the demand
is sufficient to justify it. Buyers are
allowed to pay for their land in 20
annual payments.
The largest sale held this year was
at Fort Benton, when 36,624 acres of
Chouteau county land was sold for
$642,308.
In Blaine county the state land sale
included 5,365 acres for $65,074.
In Hill county 7,655 acres were sold
for $114,374.
In Valley county the sales included
7,016 acres for $105,226.
Another reason for keeping evangel
ists away from the border is that
some militant might start up "On
ward, Christian Soldiers."
"Marry Amreican women first," has
always been an appealing slogan to
impecunious foreign counts.

GUARDSMEN
RETURN TO CITY
CORDIAL WELCOME GIVEN BOYS
FROM THE BORDER. MADE
FINE RECORD.
The boys are back. Saturday after
noon Glasgow's contingent to that
great army which Uncle Sam has
mobilized on the border of Mexico re
turned to this city after an absence
of five months.
The reception accorded them was
indeed a credit to the city and the
boys were welcomed back to their old
homes with a spirit that deserves com
mendation. Mothers, wives, sweet
hearts and friends were at the train
to greet the boys in uniform, and
many of the scenes on the depot plat
form when families were re-united,
were as touching and pathetic as when
the boys left for the front.
The spirit of we i come was manifest
Sf
W. B. Shoemaker, Clerk and Recorder
ed by every citizen of Glasgow and
every one of the boys of Company
"G" had a kindlier feeling in his heart
toward the city and its people.
A formal reception and welcome
was held in the Gibson Opera House
Saturday evening, and prominent citi
zens voiced the sentiment of the com
munity in welcoming the guardsmen
back into civil life. Solos, vocal and
instrumental, pretty «lances, and words
of welcome and cheer from the speak
ers made the evening an especially
pleasant one for the boys, and after
the program, the floor was cleared
and the remainder of the evening was
spent in dancing.
Almost five months ago, to be exact
on June 19th, Co. G of Glasgow was
summoned with other national guard
organizations to answer the Presi
dent's call for service in Mexico. A-f
ter five days spent in getting equip
ment together and recruiting, Glas
gow's contingent left for the State
Mobilization camp at Helena. Here
they were given more complete equip
ment, and their training commenced
in earnest. On -Tune 29th "they were
mustered into the federal service and
on July 2nd, they entrained for the
border, arriving at Douglas, Arizona
five days later.
Border duty, with its drill and dis
cipline, hot weather and sand, warm
water and flies, tarantulas and scor
long hikes, soon wrought a remarkable
pions, inoculations and dysentery and
change in the "rookies" from the north
