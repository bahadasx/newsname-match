fJoverrior Hiram W. Johnson has

STATE CONTROL
OF RAILROADS
Action Taken by 20 Represen
tatives in Session Here,
State control of railroads insofar as
intrastate rates is concerned was ad-
ocated by more than twenty men repre
senting shipping interests of Oklaho
ma who met in the l ee llm kins hotel
this morning to take action on the
movement in the east to place in the
hands of the interstate commerce com
mission the power to fix all rates.
Resolution Adopted.
A resolution asking that rate-regulating
Mwer he left to individual stales
but requesting that if such is impos
sible a regional plan of supervision
such as is advocated by J. II. John
ston of Oklahoma City be adopted hy
the federal government, was passed.
Committeeamed.
A commite on ways and means,
consisting of Frank Foltf. represent
ing Oklahoma Millers, chairman; K
(t. Illaiiton, representing jobbers; R
H. Urennan, representing grain men;
J. R. Harris, representing manufactur

FORM
II-' Mr Hughes were to win West Virginia, New Hampshire, Minne
sota and S'ew Mexico, he would have JdJ votes, four less than the -'(in
Mites necessary for a decision in the electoral ollege
Hughes is leading in Minnesota, New Hampshire and West Virginia,
and it is likely he will get those states, giving him .'5' votes. Hut New
Mexico shows such a lead for Wilson that it seems impossible tor
Hughes to carry New Mexico.
Then the only possibility of defeat for President Wilson lies in a
split in the electoral vote of California
With California solid, President Wilson has voles. Including
New Mexico President Wilson has 272 votes.
Allowing for a possible split in California that would give six elec
toral vote to Hughes in that state, President Wilson still would have the
necessary 2ofi votes.
The only time that the California delegation in the electoral college
has been split was in 1912, when two democratic and twelve progressive
electors were chosen.
In the Los Angeles district, where Hughes ran strongest there aie
two congressional districts. There are two other congressional dis
tricts in southern California, in one of which, Wilson appairntly had
the lead. It is not conceivable that there can lie a break of more than
six delegates in California.
In all San Francisco and the northern territory, Wilson ran awav
ahead of Hughes.
Here is the last minute news from the six states in which the re
publicans probably will demand a recount:
CALIFORNIA: With 31 precincts missing, Wilson leads by .1.170.
MINNESOTA: With 35 precincts missing. Hughes leads hv 70S.
WF.ST VIRdlNIA: With 3 precincts miising, Hughes leads by
2 MS.
NF.W HAMPSHIRE: With 8 precincts missing, Hughes leads
by 107.
NEW MEXICO: With 72 small precincts missing. Wilson leads hv
22.U.
NORTH DAKOTA. With .1.1 precincts missing, Wilson leads In
1 ,5 0.

NKW YORK, Nov. 10. Republican National Chairman
William R. Willcox. following a conference of the campaign
manager today, refused to concede the flection of President
Wilson.
In a formal statement he declared that t ho result still de
pends upon the vote of close states and that the returns from
these were so far unofficial and might be changed by the of
ficial count. Mr. Willcox stated, however, that the national
committee would abide by the decision of the official count
unless special circumstances arose which made other action
' necessary.
Three States in Doubt.
This was the important development in the presidential
j election situation up to 1 o'clock this afternoon. Returns con
.tintied to filter in from states that had been close, but they
! made no change in the figures which gave President Wilson
JG!) electoral votet and Mr. Hughes 213.
Minnesota, New Mexico and New Hampshire remained
in doubt. Minnesota's latest returns showed Hughes leading
by 7.r2, but the figures for New Hampshire put Wilson ahead
by 2'V.) with eleven precincts missing; while he also led in
New Mexico.
McCormick Goes Home.
At democratic national headquarters the view is taken
I that the election is all over. Chairman McCormick is pre
; paring to go to his home in Harrisburg, Pa., tonight to resume
j his private business, he said today. Workmen were removing;
the furniture and the committee a local business, it was stated,
would be conducted at a branch office. The main head
quarters will be in Washington.

California Definite.
Woodrow Wilson was elected presi
dent of the I'rnted States when Cali
fornia swung definitely into the demo
,r ratic column early today The onU
slates where the result remained in

Assured .'69 Votes.
Cnlrss the vote of California is di
vided, whiih now serms a possibility
Mr Wilson is assured of 2d1' votes in
the decimal college, three more than
a majority, and Mr. Hughes of 24.1
The president could lose three votes
from California and still have enough
to elect him. This would be offset by
New Mexico which, it seems certain,
he rarried.
Could Lose Six.
If Mr. Hughes carried both Minneso
ta, with twelve voles, and New Hamp
shire with four, he would have onK
25', seven less than enough to elect
Mr. Wilson could lose New Mexico and
three votes from California and Mi'l
