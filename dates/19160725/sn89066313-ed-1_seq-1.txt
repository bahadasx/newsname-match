Breach of Faith.
r.y United Press.
LONDON, July 2.".. The coalition
cabinet was endangered today by the
Irish question.
David Lloyd-George, minister of war
and originator of the compromise plan
for settlement of the Irish problem,
was Quoted as having offered to re
sign in iew of the failure of the cab
inet to acquiesce in his proposals to
the Irish nationalists.
Premier Asquith was understood to
hae been ready also to step down if
Lloyd-George letired.
Threats to submit the question to a
vote of the people in a general elec
tion were freely made during the Com
mons debate.
The only hope of avoiding such a
break lies in the chance that the Irish
nationalists would consent to furth
er negotiations, and with John Red
mond, the party's leader, demanding
immediate action and his followers
hurling charges of breach of faith at
the ministry, it was admitted this
hope was a faint one.

ll,o, MAY BUY ISLANDS
Negotiations for Purchase of
Danish West Indies Ex
pected to Begin.
By United Tress.
WASHINGTON'. July 23. Negotia
tions for the purchase of the Danish
West Indies by the United States
probably will be made today. The cost
is approximately $23,000,000, it was
learned officially at the White House
late this afternoon. Negotiations have
been carried on by the State Depart
ment and the Danish foreign office.
The islands are of tremendous strat
egic value to the United States. Their
possession will eliminate the danger
of any European power acquiring them
and establishing a naval base near the
Panama Canal. Negotiations have
been on and off for some years. It is
understood now that sentiment in the
Danish parliament favors the purchase.

Dr. Albert S. Cook, superintendent
of schools of Baltimore County, Ma
ryland, gave the University Assembly
lecture this morning on "The Devel
opment of a System of County Schools
under a County School Unit." He told
of the work in Baltimore County.
"Our teachers have grown in knowl
edge, in professional spirit, and en
thusiasm since we have started the
system of supervision," he said. "Yet,
with jll our work, teachers arc not
satisfied with results, and I hope they
never will be. The educational mil
lennium has not reached Baltimore
County, but we have proved that a
county system can become as efficient
and practical as any city system.
"The reason the majority of teach
ers leave the country and go into the
towns to teach is because of the bet
ter money to be obtained," Doctor
Cook went on to say. "Compare the
county salaries with those in the
town, and you find that the country
teachers are underpaid. There is also
little supervision in most places. We
cannot expect this unless better sal
aries are paid."
Doctor Cook then explained how
Baltimore County worked out its sys
tem of supervision and bettered the
salary conditions, along with many
others. The unit is the county, and
both rural schools and those in small :
towns are included under the system.
The start was made with a suburban
school; then the system spread to
other parts of the county. At pres
ent the county is divided Into four
teen groups, each supervised and hold
ing meetings at least three times a
year. These meetings are held dur
ing school hours. The supervisors,
with the principals of the schools.
conduct the meetings, work out the
problems with the teachers, and help
them plan the work.
"We began to make the teachers
want something better than they had,
and through them we reached the
patrons," contined Doctor Cook.
"Through the work of these supervis
ed meetings, a revised course of study
has been worked out. Teachers are
urged to give criticism and sugges
tions. Already we have made several
changes In the course of study we
worked out. The changes have been
made because of new suggestions the
teachers have brought up. A course
of study is now being prepared which
will be strictly for the rural schools.
The plan of supervision is successful
from ccry standpoint, and I recom
mend it for other counties."

With 130 entrants in the races, tho
$1,000 mule-colt show and greater de
mand for season tickets than ever be
fore, the Boone County Fair, which
will begin August 1 and will con
tinue until August 4, promises to be
by far the biggest fair that Colum

ion of R. L. Hill, secretary of the
association.
The farmers arc mostly through
with their harvesting, and the work
on the corn is done. The roads are
in excellent condition, and the of
ficials expect record-breaking crowds.
The mule-colt show is the biggest
of its kind ever held in the United
States. At first the premiums were to
be only $C0O, but the Retail Mer
chants' Association raised the prizes
to $1,000 and made them the largest
inducements ever offered at any sim
ilar show. According to Mr. Hill,
the entire amount of the $1,000 gold
premiums probably will be on display
Friday morning in the window of one
of the local merchants.
Twice as many entries have been
made for the harness events a3 were
made last year, and the same horse
which broke a record in a race at
Moberly yesterday will be here. Mr.
Hill will go to the Randolph County
Fair at Moberly tomorrow and then
to the Callaway Fair at New Bloom-
field to induce as many men as pos
sible to bring their horses to the
Boone County Fair here next week.

CLEVELAND, July 23. Twenty
three lives were snuffed this morning
when workmen were caught in a gas
pocket 120 feet below the surface of
1-ake Erie.
The gas, ignited by electric machin
ery, exploded with terrific force.
Ten bodies of victims have been
taken from the death-hole. Rescuers
estimated more than a dozen men are
dead in the tunnel. Ten escaped with
injuries.
Burrowing toward shore, a little
band of workmen 120 feet below the
lake plunged shovels Into a monster
natural gas pocket. With tremendous
force the gas svept upon the helpless
workmen, catching them in the ten
foot concrete tube. Then came a ter
rific explosion as the gas Ignited from
a spark, and the tunnel was turned In
to a death-hole in a twinkling.
Failure to make proper tests for
gas and the lack of sufficient air pres
sure in the tube were pointed out as
contributing causes to the disaster.
It was seven hours after the acci
dent before pulmotors and helmets
were obtained. It was two hours be
fore help arrived. Three men taken
from the tunnel died before pulmo
tors were available. A treble probe
by city, county and state officials will
be held to fix the responsibility for
the disaster.
Captain Hansen of the United States
life-saving station was the first on the
scene, but he had no helmets or pul
motors, so went back for them.
Two small boats from the ore
freighter Star arrived next, but they
had no apparatus with which to cope
with the deadly fumes.
Finally word was telephoned from
shore to C. C. Van Duzen, superin
tendent of the tunneling. He gath
ered several workmen, seized a tug
and led In the rescue.
