Ambassador Page Instructed
to. Impress Great Britain
Only Complete Backdown
Will Suffice
WASHINGTON, July 24. In
strucons to impress upon the
British and French governments
that the United States desire san
early , and complete reply to its
last note regarding interference
with neutral mails, were cabled
by the state department today to
Ambassador Page at London and
Ambassador at Paris.
The step was taken after Pres
ident .Wilson and other officials
had studied the British memo
randum dealing with specific
complaints and deferring until
the future a reply to the Amer
ican contentions regarding the
principles involved.
The official text of the memo
randum made public by the state
department reveals that Great
Britain feels "obliged to disclaim
responsibility" for the specific
ocCurrences complaned of in the
American note.
In that connection it is minted out j
that "there have been many instance
of complaints -which on exami-j
nation proved to arise from the wrong!
direction or letters, the irregular sail
ings of neutral mall boats ' and
from other similar cause entirely out- i
side the control of his majesty's bov- j
eminent." -
Playing for Time
Outlines of the memorandum cabled j
from London in last night's press dis- j
patches conform closely to the offi- j
cial text. One of the subjects left for
consideration in the allies' forthcom- j
ing final deply is that the American
complaint regarding money order lists,
which it is declared involves question
of principle on which consultation be
tween those governments is still in
In renlving to the complaint re- j
garding mail removed from the steam-
ship Medan. some of which later was ,
lost on
randum
the Mecklenburg, the memo-
says the facts set forth by j
the United States "are correct except
that it is not clear that the fact that
the neutral mail bass removed from
the M3n were all sent on and
that 182 bags lost on the Mecklen
turs were; without exception for ene
my destination."
Says U. S. Mistaken
The communication concludes that
the specific complaints in the Ameri
can note "do not support the general
charges against the efficiency of the
Rritish censorship which the govern
ment of the United States have put
forward.

Rev. Otto Apitz, German immigrant

his prayer he asked that the vessel
and her crew may have a safe voyase

Banquet Follows Service
The service was followed by a ban
quet. The Necsar wjs brilliantly
lighted.
PAT1.MORK. July 24. A series of
events this afternoon at the pier
where the merchant submarine
Deutschland is berthed, indicated that
her departure would not be long de
layed. The most significant of these
were the filling of her water tan
and the stowing below her decks ot
the crew's bedding a it was removed,
from the interned North German
Lloyd steamer Ne-kar nearby. Since
their arrival two weeks ago the
Deutschland's crew have been sleep
ing aboard the Xeckar.-
Shortly after the water tanks bad
been filled, heavy bluestnoke waa
noticed cib-ing from behind the barg
es tnat screened the Deutschland
fro-n view, and directly at her stern.
The wind blowing from the direction
of the submarine raried the odor of
fuel oil and it was evident that tbe
vessel's engines were teine tested.
These activities ere preceded by
the sealing of the submarine' wire

inspector. This was in accordance
with the federal law.
