"Bridge That Boost Built" For­
mally Opened With Fitting
Ceremonies.
3,000 WITNESS THE
THRILLING FORMALITIES
Gov. Hanna and Other Prominent
Men Give Stirring Ad­
dresses.
By G7*DTMANN.
The Chalmers Bismarck press
car, furnished by the Missouri
Valley Motor Co., was the first
car to pass, westbound, over the
bridge after its dedication.
Medora, N. D„ July 24.—'Here in the
heart of the badlands, in picturesque
Medora, full of romantic interest and
frontier associations, the Red Trail
bridge, built by popular subscrption,
was dedicated today before more than
3,000 people, most of whom motored
from all points of the compass.
It was a fitting climax to a two
hours' run from Dickinson through
the Badlands, over roads as smooth
as a city pavement, and made doubly
enjoyable by the sublime scenery
that hered them in.
Th^cfrerabtri^s :whicti jofmally
opeped to traffic the Red Trail bridge,
"The Bridge that BobBt Built," were
typical of frontier days. Members of
the. ^sociability tour, as they dipped
into the basin of the Little Missouri,
upon. which Medora is located, were
received by the cowboys and cowgirls
headed by. the Hebron band. In their
gay .colored handkerchiefs, wrapped
about their necks, caps and other re­
galia of. the cow-puncher and broncho
buster, the setting gave an atmos­
phere to the reception which had in
it a touch of the regal way in which
the Marquis de Mors and the other
brave men of frontier days welcomed
the "dudes" and 'tenderfoots" of the
east, of the land beyond the sage­
brush of the land of the "biled" shirt
and its sartorial non-comitants.
J. W. Foley, the nester of Medora,
and W. L. Ray were masters of cere­
mony. Led by the band of cowboys,
cowgirls, Governor Hanna's car and
the cars that participated in the tour
to Medora, the party moved out to­
ward' the Little Missouri, the scenes
of be Morse, failures and triumphs
to dedicate the bridge, the result of
one of the most unique publicity cam­
paigns ever inaugurated in North Da­
kota, and the second bridge in the
United States to be built, by popular
supscription. The little town of Me­
dora, of less than 200, contributed
more tlian $1,200 to its erection. Its
cost was about $20,000.
Mi*'- Foley, in a speech filled with
history references and reminiscences,
introduced Governor Hanna. Behind
Mr. Foley rose the chimney of the De
Morse cold storage and abbatoir
plant, where thousands were spent to
realize the dream of the Marquis, to
make Medora the packing center of
the world and the land .flanking the
Little Missouri, the cattle range par
excellence of the world. Beyond, on
the hill, plainly in sight of the three
span bridge, is the De Morse ranch
house, in which the furniture and oth­
er trappings are the same as' when
Roosevelt and De Morse roamed the
plains, built their aircastles of a future
empire" and forded the Little Missouri
long before a bridge was even hinted

•Norfolk, Va., July 24.—The appear­

Cape Henry today led to rumors that
a Eritish and French fleet of consid­
erable size was in the vicinity of the
southern drill grounds, awaiting the
departure of the German submarine
merchantman, Deutschland, or the ar­
rival of her sister ship, the Bremen.
The new warship is believed to be

Protest to Gen. Bell.
General Gotizales and Andreas Gar­

they had protested to General Bell
against the conduct of the militia­
men, who, they said, crossed into
Mexican territory yesterday morning
"in violation of Mexican rights, and
last night shot tip, without provoca­
tion, a number of homes on the Mex­
ican side of the border."
General Bell said, however, that
Mr. Garcia had communicated with
him by telephone and that he did not
regard the conversation in the nature
of a protest, but rather a notification
that the Mexican authorities were
willing to co-operate in every way to
eliminate ]ossible chanceB of fric­
tion between the two commanders.
General Bell added that Brigadier
General Leroy Sweetzer, commanding
the Massachusetts troops, reported
that the Mexicans had fired first.

the outside. Indications were that
some of the work of opening the hole
had been done from the outside, but.
most of it was done by the prisoners,
for they carried the bricks 20 feet to
the icehouse and there buried them,
presumably so that if someone
should pass by they would not find
any traces of the project. They had
an end board of a wagon to place
against the hole if they were discov­
ered.
J. J. King, the man who escaped on
June 12, while working in the brick­
yard, and who was returned just a
week before his second escape, toid
the prison officials that a machine
met him on his former escape on a
hill within a mile of the institution.
This could not have been possible,
officers point out, unless there was
collusion with men rot in the prison.
Saw Men Carrying Clothes.
James A. Brown, member of the
board of control, who, because of the
shortage of help, went himself in the
searching party, in company with one
of the prison officials, was told by a
man they met on the road near the
prison that, while he had not seen
any men walking, he had passed an
automobile from which two men took
a bundle of clothes and started across
a field. It is believed that in this way
some or all of the men were able to
change their clothes and thus make it
much more difficult to get them.
Four Officers Still Out.
Four of the officers are yet out

GENERAL.
ALEXn N1CHOLAEV1TCH
Kuropatkin
Gen. Alexei Nicholaevitch Kuropatkin, demoted after the Russo-Japa­
nese war, today is one of the biggest figures in the Russian military family.
As commander of the right wing of the Russians he is pitting his mili­
tary genius against that of Field Marshall von •Hindenburg, the idol of all
Germany, popularly called the "Man of Iron," and is making big gains.
Gen. Kuropatkin lias always disliked display of pomp or magnificence,
striving in the very height of liis power to maintain the moral standing of
his troops. He considers it a natural act of duty for one in command to
influence his anny to a man by setting a good example in his own man­
ner of living.
The general is noted for his just dealing. Merit and bravery alone
are fconsidered by him in cases of promotion.
From the Mohammedans, among who he spent a long period of his
life, he has acquired a touch of fatalism.
Although a wealthy man, Kuropatkin does not believe in the life luxur­
ious. He lives the simple life of the soldier. He works hard and his
theory is that thoroughness is the great essential to military success.

Berlin Minimizes Gains.
Berlin still assertB the only rewilC

the Thiepval-Guillemont line, was tlMt
penetration of a few houses in tb*

Big Gains Not Official.
Although unofficial reports hav»
credited to the Russians big gains
against the Germans in the Riga re­
gion of Russia, neither the Petrogrfcd
nor the Berlin communications havo
as yet recorded any important chang­
es in the Terrain theater.
Petrograd claims the dislodgement
of the Germans in the Galitchanie vil­
lage, on the Lippa river, in Volhynla,
while Berlin says that near the Gcli*
cian border, in southern Volhynia
strong attacks by the Russians
against the German lines were re­
pulsed. Emperor William is report­
