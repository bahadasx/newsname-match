What About Latest Charter Propoaal?
Whether the governor will o any
further with the new franchise .draft
now . In his possession. In view of j
., me coun cecision, is a quesuon sxiu
' unanswered. The governor was not
willing to discuss the subject at any
length today, .having, had no'oppor.
tunity to study the decision. ;
It will be remembered that a few
months ago, while the injunction suit
was . moving through the deliberate
legal .processes,, the public utilities
commission proposed that all of the
various troublesome points under the
eld franchise be swept away and a
new franchisee bill be presented to
Congress." , . The, commission and
IUpld Transit directors held one or
two meetings and a committee of
directors worked with the commis
sioners. The city took a hand and
after numerous meetings and hearings
, (a-new franchise plan which appeared
f to be acceptable -to.' the - commission
and the company was drawn up. This
plan was then submitted to the gov
ernor, who has had it in possession
for cany, weeks. He has given no
Intimation, whether he favors It In
prlnciple or la deUIl, hr both or in
neither. It was to have been sent to
; - Congress but the guess has been made
, that the -governor waited for the . su
preme court decision, before taking
any action cn the new franchise.
( Doubt Further Action. .. ,--.
Rapid Transit representatives rather
doubt now whether thia proposed fran
chise will be carried any further. They
say also that la the light of the eu-
.'; preme court decision, ' which upheld
Circuit Judge Stuart, the Rapid Tran
' sit directors might not be entirely sat
isfied with the charter proposal The
: present charter is admittedly a good
charter for the company and, feeling
't that they have won a decisive legal
; -victory and have been sustained, the
directors might not wish to proceed
;. further:, now with, plans for another
charter,' rt Is conceded that no ma
terial action could be . taken : by the
present congress, anyway, because of
, the late date and because congress is
tied up on legislation the administra-
; tloo is bent on putting through. 5
Therefore the feeling seems to be
that th charter proposal about which
there -was such a pow-wowing a few
- months ago will die a lingering death
T In some pigeonhole-without ever get
ting. to Washington. , ;.
May Be Further Delays. .
Manager Ballentyne pointed out this
' morning that there may be further
legal proceedings which would prevent
the company from going ahead with
lmprovamenta.
"If the decision of the, ' supreme
court here Is appealed to the ninth
circuit court of appeals, we would not
be Justified In proceeding with costly
improvements.; ... . , . : ' ;
"Then, too, there " is a possibility
. that the territory might start a suit
