CLARK JORDAN
CROSSES RIVER i
Former Proprietor of St. Asaph Ho
tel Passes Away Monday After
Making His Peace With God.
News of the death of Edward
Clark Jordan at an early hour Mon
day morning caused profound grief
among the many friends he had
made here since coming to Stanford
about five years ago to assume the
management of the St. Asaph Hotel.
For the past few weeks he had
been gradually sinking, and realized
in his lucid moments that the end was
near and having made his peace with
God was ready and willing to go.
The coming of the Death Angel for
his spirit must have been indeed a
relief to his tortured frame, and it
was with a gentle sigh that he passed
over into that "Unknown Country,"
that bourn from whence no traveler
has e'er returned.
Mr. Jordan was a native of Ma
son county, Virginia, and was 47
years of age. He is survived by his
wife, who is a daughter of Col. J. H.
Daigh, of Waynesburg. For several
years the deceased conducted the ho
tel at Waynesburg, but about five
years ago he came to Stanford and
bought the St. Asaph Hotel from the
late C. C. Gooch. He conducted it
until a few weeks ago when he leased
it to B. D. Carter and Son, and then
took rooms at the home of Walter
Jones on Danville street, where his
death occurred and from whence the
funeral will be held this afternoon
at 3 o'clock.
A man of the most positive con
victions, Mr. Jordan, was withal one
of the kindest hearted and most
charitably inclined, who ever engag
ed in a public business in Stanford.
What he did of his means, for relief
of the poor and distressed, was done
without display or ostentation, how
ever, and no one will probably ever
know on this earth the extent of his
gjEjngrqsity and the scope of his char
TftySiBut those who knew the man
and his good works and generous
deeds, feel sure that his name is
written up there as one who often
ministered unto "the least of these
my children," and that his reward
will be accordingly.
Funeral services will be conduct
ed this afternoon at 3. o'clock by D.
M. Walker, assited by Revs. M. D.
Early and P. L. Bruce, after which
interment will be in Buffalo Springs
cemetery. Stanford lodge, No. 15G,
I. O. O. F., of which deceased was a
member, will conduct the beautiful
funeral rites of the order over the
grave of their departed brother. The
pallbearers will be: Mesrs. B. L. Fa
galy, J. E. Jordan, F. C. Weick, B.
D. Carter, T. J. Hill, Jr., and J. W.
Acey.
Rev. R. R. Noel, the aged Baptist
divine, who has boarded at the de
ceased's hotel for a number of years,
saw him every day and knew him in
timately, has written the following
tribute to his memory:
In Memoriam.
Edward Clark Jordan was born
July 2, 18G9 in Mason county, Va.,
and died July 23, 1916. He leaves
a wife and two brothers, two sisters
and many friends to mourn his de
parture. Mr. Jordan moved from
Waynesburg about five years ago and
became proprietor of the St. Asaph
Hotel in this city. As landlord he
was a model. Upon the walls of his
office were cards bearing in large
letters, "Positively No Card Play
ing;" a nicely bound Bible was in
the rack over the commercial table.
Mr. Jordan had never joined the
church. Several years ago, Dr. Rod
dy assisted the writer in a meeting
at Waynesburg. A large number
were baptized, his father-in-law be
ing one of them. His wife joined by
letter. Mr. Jordan was deeply con
cerned. Time passed. About 12
days before his death, he took the
writer by the hand and with joy ac
cepted Jesus Christ as his savior. His
hope like an anchor over and within
the vale, seemed to be sure and
steadfast. A few hours before death
he cried whilst suffering: "Jesus
come and help me."
We mourn, but not without hope.
To his beloved wife, brothers and
sisters we offer deepest sympathy.
Mr. Jordan was a member of
Stanford lodge No. 156, I. 0. 0. F.,
also a member of the Maccabees at
Waynesburg. Dr. Walker was a
great friend and favorite and will
conduct services assisted by Dr.
Early and Rev. Bruce. Burial in
Buffalo Springs cemetery at 3 o'clock
P.- If., July 25, 1916. R. R. NOEL
LANCASTER COURT DAY
Three Candidates for Congress
There, But Business Dull.
There was not much doing at Lan
caster court Monday. The crowd
was small and business was quiet.
Farmers were too busy to leave
home and many of the traders were
not on hand from some cause. There
was a bunch of mountain ewes on
the market which sold at $7 and a
few heifers that were bought at 6
1-2 cents, which was about the ex
tent of the trading at the cattle
pens. Quite a number of mules
were on the square and several
changed hands. They brought all
the way from $120 to $182.50.
Army horses were scarce and Louis
Peel, of Nicholasville, and W. B.
Burton picked up only a few, for
which they paid around the $100
max-k.
There were three of the four can
didates for Congress present Hon.
Harvey Helm, Senator Charles F.
Montgomery and Dr. R. L. Davison.
Each did his share of hand-shaking
and got just as close to the dear
people as the hot weather would per
mit. They all seemed satisfied with
their day's work, while the voters
were delighted at the thought of the
Congressional race being brought to
a close in the next ten days or so.
A farmers' meeting was held at
the court-house at 2 o'clock of which
W. R. Cook was made chairman and
R. L. Elkin secretary. The object
was to discuss the feasibility of se
curing a farm demonstrator. A
committee composed of Mr. Cook, J.
H. Dalton and G. B. Swinebroad was
appointed to look further into the
matter and report next court day.
Although not largely attended, the
meeting was rather enthusiastic.
Lancaster

Monday afternoon at the Court
House in the interest of securing a

Lancaster suburb, a typical old Ken

acre, as it fronts on the street and
could be made available as fine
building lots.
Garrard farmers have rushed up
their threshing business in order that
they might turn their attention to
their tobacco and corn crops, many
of them, having already delivered
their wheat to the local grain deal
ers. Some sold immediately at the
thresher, and consequently previous
to the rise in the price of the bread
cereal, Messrs. Ed and N. B. Price
having brought in to the Garrard
Milling Company a 350-bushel con
signment for which they were paid
$1 per bushel; some later deals were
the sale of 500 bushels by Walter
Davidson who received $1.05 per
bushel, 700 bushels delivered by T.
C. Rankin and D. Rankin at $1.11

L MISSED INSURANT AGEiOT
On Phone Call So Joe Will Rout Lost
Heavily Hoffman Had $1,000.
M. J. Hoffman, of Williamsburg,
was here late last week en route to
Moreland to see what was left of his
large barn which was struck by light
ning and completely destroyed by
fire late last week. He took with
him Jesse D. Wearen, local insur
ance man, in whose companies Mr
Hoffman carried $1,000 insurance
on the structure. This, however,
will not compensate him for the hea
vy loss sustained as he built the barn
at a cost of about $2,000 and it was
considered one of the finest in that
part of the county if not the finest.
The heaviest loser from the catastro
phe, however was Joe Will Rout who
had no insurance on the contents of
the barn and lost about $1,000 worth
of stuff, which he can ill afford to
lose. It was irony of fate that Mr.
Rout should suffer such a loss, for
only the evening before the building
and contents were destroyed, he had
endeavored to get Mr. Wearen over
the phone here to place insurance
with him, but was unable to catch
Mr. Wearen just at that time, and
the next day the building and con
tents were destroyed.
