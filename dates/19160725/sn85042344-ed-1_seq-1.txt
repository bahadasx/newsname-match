BRITISH EVADE ISSUE
IN THE MEMORANDUM
Deals in Specific Cases and
Does Not Touch Prin
ciples Involved.
WASHINGTON, July 24. In
structions to impress upon the
British and French governments that
the t'nited States desires complete re
ply to its last note regarding inter
ference with neutral mails, were ca
bled by the state department today
to Ambassador Page at London ana
Ambassador Sharpc at Paris. The.
step was taken after President Wil
son and other officials had studied
the British memorandum dealing1
with specific complaints and deferring1
until the future a reply to the Amer
ican contentions regarding the prin
ciples Involved.
The official text of the memoran
dum made public by the state de
partment reveals that Great Britain
fci Is "obliged to disclaim responsibil
ity" for the specific occurrences com
plained of in the American note until
tlu-re lias been "opportunity of lnves
tlgatimr ill detail."
Its that connection, It is pointed
out. fiat there have been many in
stances of complaints w-hich
on examination proved to arise from
the wmng direction of letters, the ir
regular ailings of neutral mail
" and from other similar
causes entirely outside the control o
his majesty's government."
Dispatches Like Official.
Outlines of the memorandum re
ceived from London in laHt night's
press dispatched conform closely to
the officials text.
tine of the subjects left for consid
eration In the allies' forthcoming n
nal reply is that the American com
plaint regarding money order lists,
which, it Is declared, "involves ques
tion of principle on which consulta
tion between those governments is
stil! in progress."
In replying to the complaint re
garding mail removed from steamship
Medan, some of which later was lost
on the .Mecklenburg, the memoran
dum says the facts set forth by the
t'nited States "are correct except that
it is not made clear, though it is the
fact, that the neutral mail bags re.
moved from the Medan were all sent
on and 1X2 bags lost u.
the Mecklenburg were without excep
tion for enemy destination."
The communication concludes that
the specific complaints in the Ameri
can note "do not support the general
charges against the efficiency of tho
British censorship which the govern
ment of the L'nitcd States has put
forward."

A Machine-Made Measure
NO intPiliprnt man with a fair and unbiased mind and
who has studied tho question will vote in favor of the
proposed new election law that is to he presented at the polls
ou Tuesday, August 1.
If this measure, sometimes referred to as "The literaey
test law," should become a part of the constitution, it will be
the means of disfranchising approximately 30,000 voters, in
cluding Indians, whites and negroes. It will necessitate the
holding of another state-wide registration before the general
election in November, at which time everyone who registered
last May and all others who are entitled to vote will have to
look up their precinct registrar and get a certificate. It will,
in effect, bring into play all of the corrupt election measures
passed by the last state legislature. It will vitalize them.
The reign of the crooked politician in Oklahoma is draw
ing to a close. The day of corrupt election methods is al
most ended.
The very method by which politicians hope to foist this
law upon the people should condemn it to every decent, re
spectable and law-abiding citizen. It is not a question of par
tisanship or politics it is a matter of redeeming Oklahoma
from the hands of crooks and parasites.
The men who framed this law so worded it that if you do
not vote on way or another on the measure you will be re
corded as voting for it. You must scratch out WITH A
LEAD PENCIL the words, "For the Amendmeut" that will
appear on the printed ballot. It is such trickery as this that
has placed Oklahoma in disrepute and that has caused a wide
spread demand for honest laws and fair election, to the end
that the will of the people may not be thwarted.
As au honest citizen, believing in justice and fairness to
all, you should go to the polls on primary election day and
register your disapproval of these methods.

ENID, kla., July 24 II. CJ. Mc

I lest and most prominent Republican..,
j has Issued a statement t olhe voters of
Oklahoma, in which ho advances
some of the strongest arguments
, at'ainst tho proposed new election
lav, to be voted on ut the August pri
mary thut Iiuve yet been put into
wilting:
! r .Aiigu.st 1 at the primaries, a
; veto will be cast on the amendment
'to the constitution commonly called
the literacy test, or designated as state
c.ueslion No. S2. Initiative petition 55.
I A 1 mncratio paper of this county
'has recently published a "canned" edi
torial urging the voters to support
this amendment.
: in ihe language of one of Okla-
noma's loading Democrats, this
amondinent Is undemocratic, unrepub
lican and un-American.
MarJiiiH) Measure.
I Tho Republicans are not making n
light on this amendment so much be
cause it la a literacy test, because
tl ero could be an honest difference
I of opinion as to the advisability of
lel'Plying a literucy test to voters, but
they are making their light on it be
i cause it was conceived in Iniquity by
an unscrupulous Democratic machine
tor tho purpose of keeping the negro
from voting, but in truth and in fact
it keeps the Illiterate white man from
voting also, and it was necessary to
make it apply to both in order that It
bo constitutional and to make no dis
crimination and to appear that It Is
a lair una Just measure. J hoy even
reiterate in the bl(l lUtelf tho section
'of both the" state and federal consti
tutions which says that "Tho right of
no citizen of this state to vote shall
ever bo denied; or abridged on uc
I count of race, color or previous con
dition of servitude," and in their bal
lot title and in the body of the bill
also they make It appear that they
should pass a law whereby "No prop
el ty ualillcntion shall ever be im
posed as a requisite for registration
or voting in this state." In other
words, this is like uskiiur a crook if
he is honest, and of course he will
. answer that he Is.
I The Solo Juilgc.
I There is no excuse for the people
of this part of Oklahoma. either
members of any party, supporting thlf
i Iniquitous measure. In the llrst place,
lit has already caused the state an ex
Itra session of the legislature for the
, extraordinary session was called to
pasa this law which the governor and
his machine are tryinx to force th
voters of this state to adopt. The
neit evil Is that should it pass there
will be a ten-day period in which
everybody has to register again and
'then you are absolutely at the mercy
'of the registration officer under the
j terms of the bill, and if you should be
an ignorant white. Republican he has
ithe absolute power to disfrancihse you
ur.der the same conditions he does me
ignorant black Republican, or if you
are not as ignorant oven as the elec
tion officer himself, which can and
will easily occur In some of the coun
ties of this state, you can still be de
nied the right to vote, because there
Is no requirement encept being- able to
read a section of the constitution and
the registrar Is the only judge.

that had come to the rescue of a white
man the soldiers the soldiers were at
tacking near the militia camp. None

The trouble began when Herbert O.
Hcline, a lawyer of New Braunfels,
Texas, went to the militia camp. He
pas;-ed a group of the negro soldiers
in the street that extends from the
army post to tho camp. An instant
lifter one of them threw a rock lifter
him. It struck the rear of his car.
Ilcnne directed his driver to stop and
he alighted. Turning toward the ad
vanning gToup of guardsmen he was
met with Invective and he instantly
chanted bis direction toward the
nearest open door, that of a saloon.
As he ran, Ilcnne claimed he heard
one of the men call out "come oil,
hi 's unarmed. Let's get him;"
Sluiulcil for Help.
Iiibi'lc the saloon he shouted to tho

for a pistol, but was told there was
none there, lie seized a big knife thai
was used in cutting tohacio and with
that weapon faced the negroes, one
of whom he said was flourishing a
knife.
The little group of his ussa Hants
had been increased by ten or Mllcen
of the same regiment, when a detach

Nineteenth Infantry rushed up tho
street and poured into the saloon. Oi
riering tho men to quarters, tho ruard
began using their guns as clubs. Vhcy
forced the negroes out Into the street,
where, reinforced until perliap.4 the
