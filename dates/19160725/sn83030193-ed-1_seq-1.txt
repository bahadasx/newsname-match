CLEVELAND, O.. July 25. Twenty
two men are dead and half a dozen
others aro d!ng as tho result of an i
explosion of gas In a waterworks tun
nel tlvo miles from shoro and fifty
feet tinder tho bottom of Lako Erlo
late last night.
The dead Include workmen who were
trapped In tho tunnel when gas ex
ploded and members of two rescue
parlies who attempted to save the men
first trapped.
Ten bodies of victims have beon
taken from tho tunnel.
Of tho dead eleven were In tho
forco trapped by tho explosion. Nono
of theso escaped. The first rescun
party contested of seven men. Three
of thorn perished and three wcro
savod. Tho second rescue party com
prised eleven men. Six of those lost
their lives and tlvo cscapod. The first
rcscuo party accomplished nothing.
The second saved ono of tho first ro
ller expedition. Of tho eight rescuers
who got out allvo two died later. Tho
others may die. Two men were also
overcome by fumes who did not go
Into the tunnel.
A third rcscuo party entered tho
tunnol at 8.30 and brought out allvo
Uustav C. Van Duzon, Superintend
ent of Water Works Construction,
who had hoaded tho second relief
force. Van Duzen may die from his
txpcrlcnces.
The tragic fate of the rescuers In tho
first and second Instance was duo to
the fact that they worked without
oxygen helmets, which wcro unavail
able. Of those rescued who nftcrwurd
died, no pulmotorn wcro at hand for

This lack of rcscuo apparatus was
roundly condemned by tho rescuers

Tho third rescue party was equipped
with helmets, which had been assem
bled, but nearly cloven hours had
elapsed following tho explosion beforo
sufficient equipment to fit out tho
third rescuo party was at hand to
permit a descent Into tho tunnel.
The explosion of gua occurred
about a hundred feet from the crib
In tho now tunnel, which will connect
with the big filtration plant recently

were caught In tho shaft. Eight men

MOUNTAIN, 7,103 FEET HIGH,
CAPTURED BY ITALIANS
Although there was some conflict in the reports to-day
from Berlin, Paris and London, the advantage seemed to.
be on the side of the Entente Allies.
Berlin admitted that the French had "temporarily
gained ground" south of Estrccs, at the lower end 'of the
Somme front, but asserted that a combined allied attack
around Pozieres and Maurepas, north of the Somme, had
failed. It was declared the French had suffered heavily is
losses.
According to the Paris War Office the French carried
strongly fortified blockhouses south 'of Estrccs while the
Germans were ejected from trenches they had occupied
nearby.
North of the Somme the struggle on the line from
Thiepval to Longueval is continuing with great Intensity.
Gen. Haig reported further gains in the village of Pozieres,
and declared German counter attacks were everywhere
repulsed, lie says the Germans have brought up heavy
reinforcements of artillery and infantry, but have been
unable to reach the British trenches at any point.
Heavy fighting is going on at Verdun. Paris reports a
hand grenade battle at Hill 304 and cannonading at various
points east of the Meuse. German attacks in Alsace failed.
Berlin admitted capture by Russians of some of Voa
Linsingen's first line trenches. Russia claimed substantial
gains on the southern front and in Armenia.
Rome claims the capture of Mount Cimone in a battle
7,103 feet in the air.
Vienna reports a successful stand against Russian
attacks in Southern Volhynia and East Galicia. Repulse of
the Italians is also claimed.
