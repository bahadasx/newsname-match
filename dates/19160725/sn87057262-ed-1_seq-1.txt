SAN ANTONIO, Tfccas, July 25.—
Three negro soldiers -of Company B,
Bighth Illinois Infantry, were in the
hospital today as the result of bullet
wounds received when they were fir
ed upon by the provost guard last
night after attacking H. O. Henne, a
lawyer of New Braunfels, Texas. A
fourth was taken to his tent.
The wounded are:
'William Blue, shot in the groin.
Edward Llghtiborne, flesh wound in
the right thigh.
Sidney Williams, left leg broken be
low the knee.
Unidentified trooper, removed to
the regimental camp. All are privates.
The wounds are comparatively
slight, owing to the guard having
used "guard" ammunition, a light
charge with a mamixm range of
about 300 yards.
The trouble started when Henne
was driving his automobile past a
group of negro militiamen. Henne
says a stone was thrown, striking the
back of the ear. He stopped and
went back to ascertain who threw the
•tone. He said he was spet with
threats and invectives. Haraa. ,tap,
ward a nearby saloon, followed by
the militiamen.
By the time Henne reached the- sa
loon his pursuers are said to have
numbered thirty or forty. He seized
a tobacco cutter and knocked down
the first negro through the door, he
says. A second he kicked in the
groin. At this juncture the provost
guard, composed of.Nlneteenth Unit
ed States Infantrymen, arrived. With
clubbed guns thejrforced the negroes
into the street.
The negroes are said to have made
a stand in the street, after Withdraw
ing some distance from the saloon.
Upon their failure to obey repeated
orders to rettirn to their quarters,
they were fired upon by the guard.
Ftour of them fell and the remainder
retreated.
Citizens wei* disposed to regard
the incident as purely a matter for
the military to settle and there has
been no demonstration against the
negroes as a- result of the affair.
Army officials of the southern depart
ment, are Investigating,

[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
BA1/PIMOIUS, Aid., July 25.—A lit
tle patch of green, visible through a
driving rain, told watchers today that
the German suibsea freighter Deutsch
land, like the star spangled banner,
was still there. What has prevented
her from heading for the Capes over
night, as apparently planned, was
more mysterious than all the mys
terious moves, dope dreams and theo
ries connected with this submarine,
venture. Moves at her dock over
night made it seem certain—at least
more certain than ever before—that
Bhe
was going at once.
But after the first maneuvers of
the early night, calm settled over the
pier, the tug Timmons only occas
ionally flashing her searchlight out
Into the storm and the Neokar and
Deutachland crews attended divine
service and then a banquet aboard
the Neckar.
Strangely enough the Timmons
early today remained at the edge of
the log boom, which gaurds the
Deutschland. Heretofore she had
ducked "back behind the oordon of
barges at about 6 a. m., after com
pleting her searchlight vigil.
All that is needed for' a dash Is to
open the front of the boom, snake
out one barge, throw a tow line to the
Deutschland and turn into the middle
branch of the Patapsco:
Manifestly the submarine is ready
in every sense of the word for a quick
'getaway.
•Whether the promoters of the new
sulbmarine line actually fear for the
iDeutschland's sister ship, the Bare
men, is something they alone know. It
appeared likely today, however, that
they have very little or no informa
tion as to her course. The most like
ly thing seemed to be that the
Deutsohland will go down to the
Capes and lie there in wait for her,
unless indeed she is taking a north
erly course toward Boston, thereby
drawing away the allied patrol from
the Capes and permitting easier
egress for the Deutschland.
May Not go at All.
BALTIMORE, July 25.—The stay or
departure of the German sub-sea
freighter Deutschland may be deter
mined tomorrow night in a confer
ence here, between her promoters
and German Ambassador Von Bern

Despite the mass of misinforma
tion surrounding her venture, it
leaked out today that Bernstorff, Con

meantime, the subject of their ses

CORONER IS
INVESTIGATING
Andther Little Girl Lies Dead,
While Youth is Under
Arrest.
(XLNEJY, 111., July 26.—Empanelled
to Investigate the mysterious death
of Elizabeth Ratcliffe, a coroner's
jury, which adjourned at moon today,
returned a verdict holding Roy Hin
terliter to the- grand jury without
bond on a charge of manslaughter.
The testimony before the jury dis
closed the Ratcliffe girl died of air
in the arteries believed to have been
pumped there
by
Hinterliter in an at­
tempt to perform an illegal operation.
The method, which officials say
•Hinterliter used in his attempts to
perform the operation, are very un
usual. Examination of the girl's
ibody disclosed a very strange condi
tion and only after a thorough in
vestigation were they able to learn,
the authorities say, of Hinterliter's
attempts to perform the operation by
using a pump.
The limp body of the seventeen
year old girl was brought to a san
itarium here late Friday night by
Hinterliter who asked the authorities
to revive her. All efforts failed. The
young man declared she had been in
the -best of health when they started
on a buggy ride, but had swooned as
they neared the city. He was ar
rested late Saturday night and held
pending the inquiry by the coroner's
Jury.
The unusual condition of the or
gans of the body and the methods al
leged to have been used by Hinterliter
to perform the operation, bid fair to
cresite the same amount of interest as
taken In ths Orpet case.

Points.
NOf EXTENSIVE GAINS
Germany Admits That British, French

Progressing.
[fiy
Ed. Li. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, July 25.—On nearly ev
ery front It appeared today from ofl
cial statements of all belligerent na
tions' war offices, the Teutonic allies
at some spot or another were com
pelled to give ground in the face of a
general offensive movement.
!No large gains were reported any
where. It was apparent from the state
ments that on the stretches of about
five miles each on the Flanders bat
tle front the armies of the allies and
the Teutonic forces were locked in
bitter death grips. Berlin reported
unsuccessful "resolute attacks" by the
British around Pozleres. General Halg
detailed counter attacks in the same
sector, adding that the enemy had
failed to reach his trenches. From all
reports. It is apparent the deadlock at
Pozleres. where each side holds half
the town. Is still continuing and pre
sumably also the hand to hand fight
ing in the woods north of Longueval.
The second stretch where fighting is
apparently of the most vlolnt charac
ter lies between Fries and Soyocourt,
where, judging from the French and
German statements, a bitter artillery
duel intrspersed with infantry at
tacks Is proceeding. It is in this sec
tor that the Germans admit that the
French have "temporarily" gained
ground south of Efetrees.
Full admission in the Garman state
ment that Gen. Sakaharoffs Russian
forces have penetrated the first Ger
man lines south of Beresteczko, con
firmed previous Russian claims of
progress of the enveloping movement
around Brody. on the way to Lemberg.
Petrograd claims further gains by
these same forces. It also reported
additional gains by the Grand Duke
Nicholas in the Caucasus campaign
against the Turks.
The Italian statement today claimed
the capture of Mount Cimon, highest
peak in the' northern Appenines, which
must have been an engineering as
well as a military feat.

Coalition Cabinet Endangered
by the Problem Which
Seems to Have No
Solution.
OFFERED TO RESIGN
Minister Lloyd George Willing

LONDON, July 25.—The coalition
cabinet was endangered today by the
Irish question. David Lloyd George,
minister of war and originator of the
compromise plan for settlement of the
Irish problem, was quoted as having
offered to resign In view of the fail
ure of the cabinet to acquiesce in his
proposals to the Irish nationalists.
Premier Asquith was understood to
be ready
alBO
to step down if Lloyd
George retired. Threat to submit the
question to a vote of the people in a
general election, was freely made dur
ing the commons debate.
The only hope of averting such a
break lay today in the chance that
the Irish nationalists would consent
to further negotiations and with John
Redmond, the party's leader, de
manding immediate action and his
followers hurling charges of breach
of faith at the ministry, it was admit
ted this hope was a faint one. Some
London newspapers today expressed
the belief, however, that if the break
came and a general election was
called, It would result In sujport of
the cabinet's course, .the nationalists

British Thrust Today Along!
Five Mile Front is
Resisted by the
Germans.
HAND TO HAND COMBAT
Since Friday, a Ceaseless Rain of
Fire Has Been Poured Into Enemy
by General^
Halgh.
LONDON, July 25.—The British
thrust of today was a hurling for
ward of an inferno of flame, steel and
shot along a five mile front from
Thiepval to Longueval. At only three
points in this stretch was there con
tact of men—at Delville and High
woods and Pozleres. The last named
village which is divided by the main
highway from Albert to Bapaume It'
self housed British and Germans.
Ever since Sunday morning the two
forces have grappled hand to hand in
desperate combat.
The wide street which stretches
out in the town's suburbs to join the
Bapaume highway was No Mans
Land. It was swept by a rain of ma-
chine gun bullets from both sides.
and then this deluge stopped"
momentarily as forces from one side
or the other charged. Then it was
bayonet to bayonet.. At last reports'
it seemed that the Anzacs—sturdy
British colonists tested in the blazing
iheat of Galllpolt—were slowly but
surely-wresting an advantage.
None the less desperate were the
struggles for supremacy in the two
sparse forests at Devllle and High,
woods. The forests themselves werw
gone. Of the leafy foliage nothing
remained. Shot and shell and hand!
grenades had stripped the trees into,
gaunt fire blackened poles, or lai$.
them low on the ground in fnextrK
cable confusion. Behind these bar
riers of logs the Germans and British!
fought fiercely.
There was no dimunition In the ar
tillery fire which General Haigh has
now been pouring ceaselessly into
the German lines since Friday. On
the other hand the Germans pounded:
away with explosive shells, ga»
shells, shrapnel and machine gun fire.
General Halg's Report.
LONDON. July 25.—"The greatei
part of Pozleres Is now ours." report
ed General Halg in an official state
ment today.
The British commander in chief de
clared that nowhere had the Teutons
reached the British trenches.
German counter attacks at several
points north of Pozieres were all frus
trated, the report declared. The Brit
ish gained some additional ground and
captured two machine guns and mora
prisoners.
Another French Advance.
PARIS, July 25.—Another advanca
of French troops was reported in to
day's official statement. They car
ried "strongly fortified block-houses"
south of EBtrees and ejected the Ger
mans from trenches they occupied
nearby. Counter attacks elsewhere
along the French front by the Ger
mans were repulsed.
North of Vermandovillers, the Ge»
