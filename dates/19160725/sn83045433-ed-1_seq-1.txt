TO SATISFY U.S.
tate Department Informs
British that Note Does Not
Meet Real Issue.
The State Department informed the
ritish government yesterday that its
iemorandum on the mails was wholly
nsatisfactory to the United States in
leting the issue raised over the in
rference with the mails.
In acknowledging the receipt of the
emorandum cabled from London on Sat
rday the State Department again served
:tice on Great Britain that it still
waited a reply to its note of May 24.
hich has gone unanswered for two
onths.
The memorandum received on Sunday.
hich was given to the press by the State
epartment yesterday, is considered as
holly evading the principle involved. The
emorandum confines itself almost ex
usively to discussion of two speciflo
istances. defends the censors for expe
Ling their work of espionage, and adds 1
tat the British government "will always
a ready to explain in detail the workings
r the censorship."
State Department officials declare they
r not need any explanation of the work
igs of the censorship. They have had
afficient complaints from Americap firms
hose confidential letters were rifled of
ieir contents, to know all they want to
now about the censor's activities.
What the United States government
ants Great Britain to do is to respond
Sthe American contention that "genuire
arreepondence is under conventional
tipulation inviolable."
The memorandum made publie yester
ay was accepted as forecasting a fiat
ental of American demands In the forth

reat Britain explains that her reply is
Ithheld pending consultation with her
lies. In her last communication Great
ritain brought France into the case. by
mding an identical note. although the
nited States has had no quarrel with
