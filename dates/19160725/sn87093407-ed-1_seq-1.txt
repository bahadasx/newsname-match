Seattle av a shipbuilding center lias always been con
sidered more or less of a joke, according to seat'aring men.
The port has been content to enjoy a rapid growth a«
a pomf of entry, paying little concern to where the •vessels
were made which brought the valuable cargt»e>. from the
wet coast, the i»land>. Masks and the < )rient.
Seattle grew and outsiders supplied the \es>elv
Along came the Huropean war and by submarine and
other devices a big dent was put in the fleet which handled
the allied trade. The German flag disappeared from I'.lliott
bay entirely.
With the shortage of ve--«els growing more noticeable
every day and with the greatest period of exportation in the
fcj;tory of the Northwest at hand. Seattle engineering firms
wofced at the freight sheds, wharves and warehouses filled
to overflowing, with hardly an available vessel to relieve
the congestion.

Thousands of men are being employed and mil
lions of dollars invested in this new business which
sprung up along the water front and the East water
way in a twinkling.

Council Holds Special Session Today
to Discuss Professional Lawbreakers
A call for a <-j>ei'ial session of the round! to discuss
"ways and mean* of driving professional lawbreakers
from the city" was called for 2 \if m. Tuesday.
Councilman Hesketh prepared the following reso
lution for the meeting: "Whereas, the shooting of
Policemen \\ iley and Weedin, as a result of trying to
cope with professional lawbreakers and gunmen of the
Bilhngsley type by the usual legal methods, brings
home to the people of Seattle a necessity for drastic
and immediate action of some kind which will effec
tually suppress the activities of such characters and
drive them from our city;
"HI. IT RKSOLVKI), that the council meet in spe
cial session at once to devise ways and means of as
sisting the mayor and |>oliie department in ridding the
city of lawbreakers, who, in defiance of the laws of <iod

Logan, Fred and Or* Billingsley, brothers, and their
father, R. W. Billingsley, are locked in solitary con
finement in the city jail Tuesday. A special detail of
detectives are out under orders from Mayor Gill to
gather any evidence connecting them with the shooting
of Police Officers Weedin and Wiley, by 1. Suhiro, the
Billingsley's Japanese watchman.
The Japanese, along with Weedin, was killed in a
gun fight at Westlake and Ninth aves. Monday night.
First degree murder charges will be filed against
the Billingsleys before night. Mayor Gill declared.
Police found a distillery with full equipment for manu
facturing whisky underneath Billingsley's warehouse shortly
after noon, according to a rejtort they made to Chief Beck-
"plant" will be turned o\Tr to the ffcderal
••uthontie the chief said.
It was <li«oivered during an investigation of the building
following a fire, which started while police were guarding
the locked doors.
The mayor went to C aptain of Detectives Tcnnant per
sonally early Tuesday morning and ordered him to "get the
Billingsleys."
Logan was arrested hv Lieutenant Hedges in Judge Gor
don's court at 10 a m. lie was there facing a charge of al
leged violation of the liquor law.
(ieorge Yanderveer cautioned Billing-ley to "keep silent."
Bail U Refuted All Prisoners;
Locked in Separate Cells
The young druegiM submitted to -earch without a pro
test
Thirty minutes later, Detectives Doom and Peyser arrived
at headquarter- with Fred Billingsley, aged 23, and R. W. Bil
lingsley, the father, aged 51, and Ora, 25.
Bail was refused them They were locked in separate
cells
Two Billingsley brothers gave their occupations as "drug
gists," anil the father as "farmer." Ora said he was a tailor.
The family has been in trouble repeatedly with the police
over illegal sales of liquor.
Attorney Yanderveer was told he would have to negotiate
with Mayor Gill on the case.
Hp called the mayor by telephone.
"How about bail for the Billingsleys?" he asked.
Mayor Grows Indignant When
Attorney Asks About Bail
"Bail!" exclaimed the mayor. "We're holding them for
fir«t degree murder. It's a *hanie that these fellows
came here. Jack Wcedin was a good friend of mine and
yours, too."
"Sure, it's a shame." said Yanderveer, "but you can't
hold tlie-e fellows when there is no e\idcnce to show they had
anything to do with it. There's no use of you going crazy
over this—"
''Yes, I AM going crazy over this affair last night," in
terrupted the mayor.
Yanderveer said he would start habeas corpus proceedings
later in the day.
Sherman, anothher brother, has not yet been arrested.
Lundin Says He May Charge
Billingsleys With Murder
Prosecutor Lundin said the Billingsleys would be held in
jail without bail for the coroner's jury unless their attorneys
demanded thrir release on a writ of habeas corpus, in which
case lie declared he would charge Logan, and possibly the
others, with murder in the first degree.
The coroner's jury*will be impanelled at once to view the
body of the dead police sergeant and adjourned until Driver
Wiley recovers sufficiently to appear as a witness.
"1 am informed," said Lundin, "that Suehiro made the
statement before he died that Logan Billingsley ga\e hint the
gun with which Sergeant \\ eedin was slain."
Lundin is determined to "go clear to the bottom of this
crime," he said.
It became known Tuesday, thru informaton furnished
