Men and the Resources and
Will Win,
London, .Inly 25. Premier Asqulth
yesterday asked the House of Com
mon for a vote of credit of C460,
000,000. This vote is the largeal
asked by the government since Ihc he
ginning of the war and will bring the
total voted this year to ,C 1,050.000.000.
and the total since the beginning of
the war to 1,832,000,000 (approxi
mately ? 11,1 CO, 000,000.)
Iii moving the vote of credit 1 ho
premier said the recent expenditure
out of tile vote of credit was approxi
mately -t 5,000,000. The 8,000,000
daily referred to by Reginald McKen
na, the chancellor of the exchequer,
represented all of the outgoing, the
premier said. All the expenditure
from April 1 to last Saturday was
669,000,000,
Mr. Asqulth said the navy, army
and munitions cost 379,000,000, the
loans to Oreat Britain's allies 157,
000,000 and food, supplies, railways,
etc., 28,000,000. The average
daily expenditure oft he war, he said,
was 4,960,000, The premier said he
hoped the excnditurc for the army
and navy would not exceed the present
level in the near future. The muni
tions cost remained stationary at the
highest level yet reached, he added,
and might increase.
Premier Asquith said that since the
outbreak of the war ther had been
12 votes of credit, totaling 2,83S,000,
000. The present vote was substanti
ally larger than its predecessors, but
this was not because any great ex
tension of expenditure was anticipat
ed, but in order to make, provision tor
n longer period and the covering of
any necessary results.
After a speech by Winston Spencer
Churchill criticizing ' Premier Aaquith
for not reviewing the war Situation,
David Lloyd-George, secretary for
war. replied, saying thai it would b
nreiuature to survey a military situa
tion and the prospects in the miildb
of a battle. "The prospects are good,'
the war secretary said; "our generals
are more than satisfied and proud of
the valor of our men they are leading
Great as the British infantry was in
Wellington's and Napoleon's day, they
never have been greater than now
One thrills with pride when one thinks
one belongs to the same race. They
are pressing back the formidable foe
who devoted his best brains to tin
study of war lor generations. I feel
confident that victory is assured to
UK."
Continuing Mr. Lloyd-George said:
"Numbers and all other resources art
' on our side. There was only one fear
that years of training and thought
on the pari of a great military power
might be something that might be In
superable. Our men have deinonstrat
ed that it Is not so and that British
resfuireeliilness and intellim ince are as
in fields of commerce in the past when
they have been able to snatch victory
out of whnt appeared to be complete
commercial disaster, going to snatch
victory again in a few months from
what appeared at one moment to be
Something that was Invincible. There
is no doubt at al that the lesson of
this battle is that wo have to simply
press on with all resources and victory
will Imj ours."

HOME RULE FAILURE
Government Admits Inability to Carry
Out Plans.
London. July 25. The Daily News
reports that David Lloyd George, in
vie of the failure of the Irish nego
tiations, in which he was the chief
sent, offered to resign his office.
"The Premier's attitude," says
he News, "is understood to be that
it Mr. Lloyd George resigns he
should consider himself obliged to re
sign also. The matter is now being
discussed.
There i; no doubt that the events
Ol the past week, culminating in the
Irish fiasco," adils the paper, "have
weakened the Coalition Government's
position.''
Loudon, July 24. Premier Asqulth
startled the House of Commons this
evening by threatening a general elec
tion over the Irish question.
be threat was made at the conclu
sion oi a del, ale on a motion for ad
journment made by John Redmond,
the Nationalist leader, who said he
wished to call the attention of (he
members of the Mouse to the rapidly
growing unrest In Ireland and the de
plorable effect resulting from the Gov
ernment not having carried out in its
entirely the tentative agreement for
a temporary Government in Ireland.
Mr. Redmond's motion followed an
announcement by the Premier confirm
ing publicly the suspicion that the
Cabinet had been unable to reach a de
( ision on the Home Rule Amending
bill, The strangling block appears to
have been the retention in the Imper-
ial
ferllament of National!! nepre-
Mentation in undiminished numbers
The Premier declared bluntly that the
Government had no Intention of In
troducing any home rule for Ireland
bid With regard to which there was no
substantial agreement among all par
ties, and it was in the course of an
appeal to the Nationalists not to throw
away the opportunity for bringing
homo rule Into Immediate operation
that he made his threat of going to
the country with the whole matter.
Just before the motion ol .Mr. Red
mond was voted down. Mr. Asquith
directly addressed the Nationalists, de
nying that, any partiality had been
shown to either side during the nego
tiations. He said the exclusion of the
six Ulster counties from the operation
of the Home Rule act was, to his
mind, the greatest give-and-take ar
rangement ever made in the history of
ap tiitbal controversy and he asked
the Nationalists not to break off the
in gotiations.
Tin- expressed determination of the
Nationalists to resist any mollification
in the terms of the agreement, and the
declaration of David Lloyd George,
who negotiated the agreement, that
tin' Government would not fori e new
proposal! on tho Irish nation, were
the outcome;! ol' the debate.
The situation in Ireland thus re
mains where it was, with the addi
tional factor of the unrest brought
about by the disappointed hopes of a
settlement of the Issues. In the ale
sence of any amending bill the Situa
tion now Is that the rder In Council
OftuonlHg the operation of the Home
Rule act as it stands on the statute
book until six months after the lapse
of eighteen mouths, mentioned In the
order In Council Issued In Septem
ber. 191.1, unless the war has previ
ously ended, remains In force.

COLLECTERS GO
OUT ON STRIKE
TwoThousand Prudential Men Quit

MEN HAVE ORGANIZED UNION
Men Declare They Will Tie Up Com
pany's Business as Far West as
Chicago.
New York, July 24. Two thousand
collecting agents of the I'rudential
ale Insurance company went on
strike today. The walk-out followed a
spirited mass meeting here at which It
was said the strike would tie up the
Company's collecting business as far
west as Chicago unless the men's
terms were met. Chief among the
grievances named was the refusal of
the company to confer with the men.
Officials of the International Insur
ance Agents' union, which is only two
weeks old, declared that the failure of
the I'rudential company to reinstate
50 agents here and about half that
number In Philadelphia, who were dis
charged for organizing the union,
would very likely result In the calling
out of collecting agents in cities In
i In- east and middle west.
Among those cities which would
first be affected, Harry Lumpkin,
president of the union, said, are Phil
adelphia! Boston, 1'rovidencc, Bridge
port and Buffalo.
The main issue involved, It was
stated. Is a recent rule laid down by
the company which provides that no
matter what the circumstances may
be when premiums on policies are four
weeks in arrears the policies must be
cancelled. This rule, if InforceiL
agents declared, would result In a
wholesale lapse, of policies and a gen
eial hampering of the collecting busi
ness. Recognition of the union, better
and "more reasonable" hours are
mended by the strikers.
