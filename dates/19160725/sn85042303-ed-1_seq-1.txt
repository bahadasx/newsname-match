Cleveland, Ohio, July 25.
Twenty-two men are dead and
six others are dying as a result
of an explosion of gas in the
waterworks tunnel five miles
from shore underneath Lake
Erie late last night.
The dead include the work
men trapped in the tunnel
when the explosion occurred,
and the members of two rescue
parties. Eleven were in the
force trapped by the explosion,
the cause of which is not
known. The first rescue party
consisted of seven, of whom
four perished and three were
saved, and the second party
had eleven men, of whom six
lost their lives. Of the eight
rescuers who got out alive, two
later died, and the remainder
may died as they are suffering
from the fumes.
The tragic fate of the res
cuers was due to the fact that
they worked without oxygen
helmets, which were not avail
able. The city will investigate
the lack of helmets.
Rescuers working with oxy
gen helmets brought eight
bodies from the tunnel. No
more have been found alive.
All ten bodies so far recovered
are members of the first and
second rescue parties. The
eleven workmen originally en
tombed are still buried. Res
cuers believe the tunnel caved
in after the explosion and the
remaining victims were buried
under the tons of mud and may
not be rescued for clays.
The explosion of gas occurred about
one hundred feet from the crib in the
new tunnel which will connect with
the big filtration plant recently erect
ed on the west side.
Ten men were caught in the shaft.
Eight men who were In the crib at
the time and heard the explosion
rushed down to investigate. They
found the air lock jammed, but Wil
liam Dolan, local tender, cut his way
through from the Inside with an axe
and admitted the rescuers. They
plunged into the tunnel, but them
selves were overcome. Dolan man
aged to drag John Johnson and Peor
McKenna out and get them to tho
elevator in the crib shift. All three
men were in a dazed condition from
the gas, but managed to reach he
crib and the alarm was given, tick
ets were sent up and the telephone
was used to summon aid.
Life savers and the Pre department
crews rushed to the crib nnd (-.g;miz-ed
the remaining workers at tiie (rib
into a rescue party, in an effort to
reach the sixteen imprisoned men, but
no headway could be ma'lo on ac
count of the gas.

NOT MUCH SERIOUS OPPOSITION
TO THE PROPOSED ISSUE.
ELECTION WILL BE HELD
NEXT MONDAY.
There Is no active opposition to
the proposed bond issue for water
and sewer extensions and for the con
vention hall, the election on which
will take place next Monday.
Business men and property owners
are taking the position that the prog
ress of the city depends on the pas
sage of the Issue and that for the
bonds to fall to carry would retard
the growth pf the city more than a
year,
It is being pointed out that every
cent asked for is an absolute neces
sity and that while tne expenditure
of the water and sewer bonds will
cover a period of at least two years,
tho convention hall Is needed at once.
Mr. P. C. Dings, president of the
Guaranty State Bank and one of the
members of the State and National
Bankers Association induced a com
mittee to postpone making arrange
ments for next years convention as
he wanted them to come to Ardmore
and stated that by the fall meeting of
the executive committee he would be
able to formally invite them with tho
assurance of a modern hotel and con
vention hall. Other largo organiza
tions have expressed a desire to meet
in Ardmore when proper accomoda
tions can be furnished.
The carrying of the bonds also
means a great stimulation to the
building trades In Ardmore. It is
being freely predicted that with all
assurances of water rsnd sewer con
nections, scores of new homes will
go up in every section of the city.
The secretaries of the chamber of
commerce and business mens asso
ciation have gained the consent of a
number of men to serve as an ad
visory board in the expenditure of
the money and a list of names will
be submitted at the meeting of the
city commissioners tonight.
