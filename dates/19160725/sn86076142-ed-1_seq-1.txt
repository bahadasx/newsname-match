LONDON, July 25. Replying to
questions In the House of Commons,
Lord Cecil, minister of war and trade,
said the American criticism of the
blacklist was based on a misappre
hension of that act, which was paused
last December and not unduly string
ent, compared with the French, which
provides that all persons "of enemy
nationality wherever living were ene
mies of France and that it was Illegal
for Frenchment to trade with them."

was not directed against neutral

SAN FRANCISCO, July 25. The death list of the preparedness
parade bomb explosion reached seven today through the death of j
('apt. Reuben J. Vaughn, of Berkeley, whose leg was mangled with
scraps of steel. The condition of several other injured is considered
grave.
The police began a nation wide hunt today for two men who it
is believed exploded the bomb causing the deaths. The description
of the men, who were seen carrying the suitcase towards the point
of explosion, was furnished by the conductor of a street car on
which the men rode.
Conductor Weeks, who was aboard a cable ear which is seldom
used by persons hound for the ferry, said that at 12:45 p. m. two
foreigners boarded his car at Kearny and California streets, carrying
a heavy suitcase. They seemed excited. When they debarked they
headed for Steuart and Market streets.
John Clifton, proprietor of a cigar stand at Kearny and Cali
fornia streets, said he saw two men' standing on the corner who
had a heavy suitcase. His description and that of Conductor Weeks
concur and are accurate, and have been placed in the hands of every
policeman and detective in the city and telegraphed broadcast.

The decision was written by Justice

Furthermore, the opinion set forth
that the petitioner and the Progres

within the time specified for appor

considered at this time. Court also
declined to consider the objection
that the act was Incapable of enforce

vance of conditions. The same ground
was taken to other objections and the
statute was sustained In its entirety.
