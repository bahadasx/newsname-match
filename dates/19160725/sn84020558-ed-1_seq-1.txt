AUSTRALIANS AREFIGHTING
FURIOUSLY FOR POSSESSION OF
POZIERESSND BAPAUME ROAD
(By Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
At Pozieres the Australians are still -fighting furiously with the Ger
mans for possession of the villaqe and the head of the road leading from it
to Bapaume, and the greater part of the village now is reported to be in the
Australians' hands. There has been a diminution in the vicious fighting

resulted in the French cacturina a

Berlin still asserts that the only result of the British attack Sunday along
the Thiepval-Guillemont lino was the penetration of a few houses in the

That German troops have been removed from the Verdun for the Somme
operations is apparent from the German statement that Brandenburg
grenadiers "of Douaumont fame" defeated the British in the fight Sunday
at Lonqueval.
Although unofficial reports have credited to the Russians big gains
against the Germans in the Riga regiion of Russia, neither the Petrograd
nor Berlin communications have as yet recorded any important changes in
terrain there.
Petrograd claims the dislodgement of the Germans from the village ot
Galitchanie, on the Lipa river in Volhynia, while Berlin says that near the
Galician border in southern Volhynia strong attacks by the Russians against
the German line were repulsed.
Emperor William is reported to have left the French front to observe the
operations in the east.
The Russians have made further progress against the Turks in the Er

CRl'A KLAND, ()., July 24. Im
prisoned in a new water works tun
nel under Ijtke Krie as a result of a
terrific explosion of gas in the tube,
ltl men are supposed to be dead.
The blast occurred shortly before
midnight and life savers and the clews
of the fire tugs rushed to the outer
crib. Life savers penetrated the tun
motors, prepared to enter the tunnel
and rescue the victims alive.
That any survived the gas explosion
is considered hopeless. Arrangements
have been made to receive the bodies
of the tunnel workers.
The explosion occurred nearly a hun
dred feet towards shore from the. outer
crib. Lief savers lienctruled the tun
nel a distance of fif.y feet but were
driven back by the deadly gas fumes.
Ten men were at v ork in the tunnel
when the blast occurred. The noise of
the explosion was heard by six work
men at the outer crib and they plunged
down the elevator and into the shaft
to investigate. A short time later two
of them, Peter McKcnna and John
Johnson, almost dead, crawled to the
bottom of the crib shelf, assisted by a
third, Wm. J. Dolan. and were sent up
to the crib. MeKenna lost conscious
ness but Johnson was able to get to a
telephone and give the alarm in th city
before he collasped.
Dolan was still in the shaft making
an ineffectual effort to rescue his fel
low workers when the life savers and
the fire tugs arrived at the crib. They
found that the gas in the shaft was too
heavy for them to reach the tunnel vic
tims without sufficient lung motors
and a call for this apparatus was sent
in.
Dolan said that the explosion was so
great that it damaged the lock and he
was stunned. When he regained his
senses he seized an axe and broke
through the air lock just as Johnson
and MeKenna and the four other res
curers arrived. Dolan says that the
six went into the shaft in search of
the ten men who had been working
there, but that all were overcome by the
gas. He managed to get Johnson and
MeKenna out through the lock and
to the elevator shaft but the fumes
were so thick he could not reach the
others of the parly. He gave it as his
opinion that the ten in the shaft and
the four rescuers were dead.
Today's accident is the first of &ny
consequence since the new tunnel was
started in 1H14. The tunnel is to cost
$l,.ri0U,00U and will connect with a fil
tration plant designed tojjive Cleveland
pure water.
