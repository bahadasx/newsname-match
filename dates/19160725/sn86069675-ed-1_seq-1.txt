The Montgomery County Fair which
Closed Hero Saturday, was
a Great Exhibition.
The gates to the 101C Montgom
ery County Fair were closed Sat
urday evening after four days of
th. finest ringf, races, etc., over

rain fcl, causing the entire pro
gram in the afternoon to ho post
poned with, the exception of the
Tunning races. Notwithstanding
these facts, tho attendance was
nhcmt 1,000 moro than last year

ly in emergencies without waiting
several hours to "fire-up." Mr.
Eaton further stated that the great
Dix river generating plant to sup

JAMES WHITC0MB RILEY DIES DAWY fADT
James Whitcomb Riley, thclUlll VlllVl
"Hoofcier poet," died nt his home in
Indianapolis, Ind., Saturday night.
Ho -wns considered by many ns
America's greatest poet. True poet
of the provinces was James Whit
comb" Riley; born of the Middle
West, he sang the joys, sorrows,
foncjds nnd humors of its folk,
largely in its own dialect, and the
world wns so touched by his inspi
ration and the realism of his home
ly Symbols that he wns one of the
few devoting their lives to poetry
who have gained n fortune. Mr.
Riley wns peculiarly sensitive to
the ndvnnce of nge, nnd evnded in
quiries ns to the dnto of his birth,
but the most accurate information
available indicated that he was born
in J848. "Should you. ask him lb
nge," one of his friends said, "he
would answer that he was 'this side
of forty,' and leave you to guess
which side."
The poet was tho son of Reuben
A. Riley, a lawyer and political
.speaker of Greenfield, Ind. The
younger Riley could not be brought
to the dull routine of school days,
but he was wise in tlio lore of
streams and fields. His mother, who
was' Elizabeth Narine, before her
marriage wns a writer of verse.
Instead of preparing for the prac-.
tico of law, as his father wished, the
son apparently prepared for noth
ing, and when he left home, he
turned itinerant sign painter to
make his living. What he carried
from the littlo schoolhouse was
some sympathetic knowledge of lit
erature imparted by his teacher,
Lee O. Harris, himself a poet. For
tentvenrs, Riley roved the Ohio Val
ley, painting commercial signs on
fences and farm outhouses. He bad
the trick of brush and pencil, nnd
cleverly drew sketches illustrative
fof tho virtues of merchandise nd-
vertised in the signs he nnd his
fellow-artisans made to bloom on
the roadsides. He was naturally
musical, and shone a a fiddler in
tho villages at which his party stop
ped .at night. He played for dances
and nt concerts in country hotels,
nnd he wrote rhymes which some
times found their way into tho
country newspapers.
Ho led this cheerful, free nnd
ea.y life until late in the 70s, when
he took employment as t writer for
a newspaper at Anderson, Ind. He
had now begun to write verse
the jnirpo.se, ns ho said, of provin
that he could write poetry of value,
ho perpetrated "The Poe Hoax,"
which for years was a literary
sen-ation, which ho often regretted
and oO which, ns ho often told his
friends, he knew he never would
hear tho Inst.
Publication of books of poems
year after year brought Mr. Riley
wealth and wide recognition of his
literary genius. Many of his poems
nrt of imnKjntivt, fnntnsv or uro
tho iTnii-owitv of Ponnsvlvanin con-
ferred upon him tho degroo of Doc
tor of Letters.
In July, 1011, the poet proontpd
to tho'oity of 'Indianapolis property
vnlurd at $75,000 for a situ for a
public library nud, school adminis
tration building.
