r.erid Transit representatives rather
dcult cow whether this proposed fran

say also that in the light of:-the su
prcene. court decision,"' which upheld
Circuit Judge Etuart, the Rapid Tran
sit directors might not be entirely sat
isfied with the charter proposal The
present charter la admittedly a good
charter for the company and, feeling
that they have won a decisive legal
vlctery and have been sustained, the
directors might not wish to proceed
further now with plans for another
charter. It Is conceded that no ma
terial action could be taken by the
present congress, anyway, because of
the late date and because congress is
tied up ca legislation the administra
tion is bent ca putting through.
Therefore the feeling seems to be
that the charter proposal about which
there was such n pow-wowing a few
months te will die a lingering death
