SYDNEY REED HURT
f
Attorney At Hospital in a
Semi-Conscious Condi
tion?May Die.
i Reports from Minor's Hospital No.
3 this afternoon state that Sydney
Heed, prominent attorney who was
badly injured in an automobile aci
dent at 8:50 last night probably will
^recover. .
Reed was riding In the rear seat ot
| a large Buick car being driven by
L Dave Kennedy, auto salesman at the
j Standard garage, who was driving to
i ward Dakota on the Rivesville road
i and was in the middle of the paved
I road when a tire flew off the car, ren
dering it unmanagable. The car leap
Jed off the road, across the small ra
pTirie leading to the old spring and
lodged itself against the side of the
hill on the opposite end of the ra
vine. The jump was considered to
I ?be remarkable and to have saved the
1 occupants lives.
I As soon as the "rear wheels left
the road, Sydney Reed wsb thrown
; out and his head struck against some
L object which crushed in the right
side behind the ear. In addition to
[ the injury on the head which caused
f concussion of tho brain, he receiv
Jed a crushed shoulder, probable in
jternal injuries an a badly bruised
race. '* |
i Since he was picked up he hQs not
irecovered consciousness, but has In a
semi-conscious manor has responded
|by action to commands that have been
J put to him. When asked to lift an
1 arm or to turn his head he has done
so but probably doesn't know what
he has done. He stands an even
j chance for recovery, so Dr. J. W. Mc
Donald at the hospital thinks. In tho
I accident the car lost the wheel from
?which the tire fell and was badly dam
aged otherwise.
The other ocoupants-of the care suf
Inferred from shock but were otherwise
ininjured.
"Sydney Reed is the son of Robert
eed of Boothsville, a wealthy oil
and gas operator. He has lived at the

NEW FREIGHT STATION
NOT FORGOTTEN BY B&O
Railroad Officials Also Assure Industrial Engineer Speed
That they Will Cooperate With the
Chamber of Commerce.
Industrial Engineer Speed returned
thia morning from Baltimore and re
ported a satisfactory conference with
Baltimore and Ohio officials who prom
ised hearty co-operation with the Fair
mont Chamber of Commerce in the de
velopment of any industries that may
be contemplated. That the rtew freight
station promised this city is still a
live issue with the company was the j
opinion of Mr. Speed who stated that
is among the improvements that the
Baltimore and Ohio is considering for
this section.
Tho report that Mr. Speed will make
to the Directors of tho Chamber of
his industrial survey of Fairmont is
practically completed with the ex
ception of less than a dozen local in

POLITICAL PARTY
OF THEIR OWN
Its Purpose Is to Work For
.. Amendment to the Con
stitution.
Mrs. Ellis Yost, state president of
tho West Virginia Equal Suffrage As
sociation, arrivedJJLFairmont at 12:40
o'clock this afterijoon and was es
cortod to the Main street and Cleve
land avenue suffrage headquarters
where there are gathered today half
a hundred women of the Marion coun
ty suffrage organization in session to
olect officers and to appoint commit
tees to carry on the compaign.
Mrs. Yost, Mrs. C. E. Martin, state
organizer and Miss Margaret McKin
ney, Marion county chairman, will
address the meeting. The office of
county chairman is held by Miss Mar
garet McKinney Tvho was appointed
by the State committee, but other of
fices will be filled today by election.
Several district leaders who are
present at the meeting from various
points in the county are: Mrs. L. C.
Furbee, Mannington; Mrs. Smith
Hood, Fairview; Mrs. Jesse Wilson,
Fairview; Miss Arlent Satterfield,
Rivesville; Mrs. Walter Gaskins, Mo
ongah; Mrs. J. M. Trach, Farmington;
Mrs. Ira Aiken, Union district; Mrs.
Flora Koen, Mannington. Punch was
eerved to all visitors.
The suffrage headquarters is beauti
fully arranged, every room being reco
rated with banners "Votes for Wo
men" and in significant type, one pos
ter asks "What about the women who
have no homes?" This Is meant for|
those who feel that home is woman's
place, and shows that about 85,000
women have no homes and no vote.
Everything about the premises is bus-,
iness-like and it would be difficult for
any one visiting these headquarters
and observe the maner in which the
suffrage campaign is carried on, to
refuse to listen to their plea. There
is a vast difference between tho head
quarters of tho two leading parties as
they usually are and the suffrage
headquarters. Everything about the
house on Cleveland avenue and Main
street is spic and span and the quar
ters are so comfortable it is really
delightful to be about there.
The building In which the organl
zatlon is quartered has been leased
until November 7 and it is possible
that they may retain the quarters af
ter that time.

I them by the engineer. The final re
i |>ort and the tabulation of the local

by Speed, but another effort will be
made to have these returned as soon
an possible.

of matters that demand immediate at
tention among which is the river traf
fic problem. This matter will bo taken

Brownsville Packet company of Pitts

ing of their charter by the Pennsyl

West End Bridge
Closed to Traffic
NEW SURFACE IS BEING GIVEN ;
TO THE STRUCTURE AT
PRESENT.
The concrete brige on the Country I
club road, between Twelfth street and j
Edgemont, is closed during the resur
facing of the structure by tho Atlantic
Bitulithic company. This is the
bridge built by Andrew Nicholich and
Company for the West End Improve
ment company, and which was report
ed some time ago to be in bad condi
tion. According to E. B. Moore, rep
resenting the West End Company a
competent engineer recently inspected
the structure and reported it to be
safe and with the addition of the new
flooring would be ample to care for
all traffic that may pass over this
road. According to Mr. Moore the
bridge was designed by the Trussed
Steel Company and is estimated to
carry an 8 ton load. This is presum
ably a load of eight tons to the square
foot and the maximum load which
such a bridge could bear would be
much heavier.
However the bridge has not yet been
accepted by the county court although
it is probable that as soon as the new
surface is completed which will likely
be this week, an attempt to have the
bridge accepted by the court will be
made.

flHEA 10 FRIENDS
I
Calls Upon Them to Give
Party Candidates Their
Sincere Support.
(Spec. Dispatch to West Virginian) |
CHARLESTON. July 25.?Late yea- j
terday afternoon Attorney General Abe ,
A. Lilly Issued a statement from his!
office hero in which he announced
that he had abandoned all further con
test for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination and would support Judgo
Ira Robinson for election. The Lilly
statement in full is as follows:
"I have decided to make no fur
ther contest for the Republican
nomination for governor, and here
by pledge my support, full-heart
edly and unresorvedly, to Judgo
Ira E. Robinson, believing that by
so doing the principles for which
the Republican party stands, and
in which 1 devoutly believe will be
best i romoted.
"I have made my decision only
after the best investigation I
could make as the expression of
the will of the poople by the re
cont primary after consultation
with as many of my friends as
possible and after careful consid
eration, feeling the tremendous
importance of a national and state
victory for the Republican party
in November and holding now, as
1 have in the past and will In the
future, the pary and all it means
far above any personal or privte
consideration. '
"I sincerely appreciate and am
deeply grateful for the energetic
support and unfailing, loyalty of
of my many friends. And I take
this step feeling sure that it will
have the cordial approval of all of
them, as it has of those I have
been able to consult, and that like
myself they have been Republicans
first and Lilly men secondarily
and call upon them to show in the
real campaign the same zeal, loy
alty and straightforward fighting
qualities as were shown in the pre
liminary skirmish.
"I shall work for the election of
Judge Robinson and the rest of the
Republican ticket, state and na
tional as earnestly and with as
keen a desire for success as I
worked for my own nomination in
the recent primary."
This announcement, it is understood,
Is the result of a series of conferences
which General Lilly has held with
prominent Republicans of the state. It
is pointed out here that the most sig
nificant feature of the statement is the
emphasis given to the necessity for
subordinating personal ambitions to
the good of the Republican party. This
is Interpreted as a call upon the Lilly
supporters throughout the state to
turn is for Judge Robinson, and it Is
predicted that complete harmony will
be :.n Immediate and permanent re
sult.
From all sections cf the state mes
sages were received last night express
ing proposed satisfaction at the out
come of the controversy over the nom
ination. Some of the most enthusias
tic of these messages come from
friends of General Lilly. General Lil
ly. it is expected will be a factor in
the coming campaign, and will make
some speeches In behalf of Judge Rob
inson's candidacy. Both Judge Rob
inson and General Lilly have publicly
hvowed that neither of thorn made any
statement about the other during the
primary campaign which would pre
vent his support of the other In the
event of his nomination.
Judge Robinson, who was In this
city last night declared to coment on
General Lilly's action but promised a
formal statement In a few days.

High Death Rate Due to Fact T
Rescue Parties Were Not
Properly Equipped
IN WERE NOTjiEO OF OANGE
Were Sent Into Tunnel Without First Having Test M*
Although It Was Known Gas Had Beea
J, There for Several Days.
(By Associated Press.)
CLEVELAND. Ohio, July 25.?
Twenty-two men are dead -and a half
, dozen are dying as a result of an ox
! plosion of gas in a water works tunnel
Ave miles from shore underneath Lake
Erie, late last night.
The dead include workmen who
; were trapped in the tunnel when gas!
exploded and members of two rescue
parties who attempted to save the
men. Of the dead 11 were in the forco
trapped by the explosion. None of
1 these escaped. The first rescue party
consisted of 7 men. Four of them per
. isbed and three were saved. The sec
, ond rescue party comprised 11 men,
six of these lost their lives and five
escaped.
The first rescue party accomplished
nothing. The second saved one of tpo
first relief expedition. No one has yet
reached any of the original eleven
caught In the workings. Of the eight
rescuers who got out alive two died
later and the others may die. Two
others who did ont go into the tunnej
were overcome by fumes.
A third rescue party entered the tun*
nel at 8:30 and brought out allvo Gus
tav C. Vanduzen, superintendent of
waterworks construction who hail
headed the second relief force. He may
die from his experiences. One body
also was brought out by the third res
cue party. This was a member of the
second rescue crew. It had been sup
posed that Vanduson had perished.
The tragic fate of the rescuers in the
first and second crews was duo to tho
tact that they worked without oyygen
helmits which were unavailable. These
rescued who afterward died fere vic
tims of the fact that no pulmetors
were at hand for use in attempting to
resusciate them. This lack of rcscuo
apparatus wbb condemned by the res
cuers and Mayor Harry L. Davis today
promised to conduct a rigid investiga
tion of this shortcoming as well as
into the catastrophe itself.
The third rescue party was equip
ped with helmits which had been as
sembled but nearly eleven hours had
elapsed following the explosion before
sufficient equipment to fit out the third
rescue party was at hand to permit a
descent into the tunnel.
The party of workmen caught by the
explosion entered the tunnel at %
o'clock last night. The first intimation
of the disaster came when Wm. J. Do
lan lock .tender in the air chamber at
the entrance to the tunnel heard the
dull bomb of an explosion. This was
about 9:30 o'clock Dolan was thrown
against the door leading from the air
chamber into the tunel. This door,
was Jammed by the blast and deadly
fumes poured out of the tunnel almost
overcoming Dolan. He finally managed
to close it and then releasing the high
pressure from the air chamber he
opened the door leading to the crib
above and gave the alarm to the men
at the surface of the lake.
SupL John Johnson summoned vol
unteers and led the first rescue party
of volunteers down the elevator ana
into the tunnel 150 feet from the bot
tom of the shaft they began to stum
ble and crumble and fall overcome by
fumes. Dolan who had resumed his
post in the air chamber rushed after
uiem. He saw a flash of light in the
darkness. It proved to be Johnson
flash light which he still grasped
where he had fallen. Dolan dragged
him to bottom of the elevator shaft
and went back. Almost dead himself
he tried to drag Peter McKenna to
safety. Then he collapsed. Others
from the crib took the, three up the
elevator and they were placed aboard
boats which had been attracted from
shore by rocklets.
It was two hours later that Vandu
son who had been summoned from
home by telephone organized the sec
ond rescue party on shore and went
to the cjib. With his men he descend'
ed Into the tunnel. His men found Mi
chael Keough of the first rescue part>
still alive and dragged him out. They
went in again only to suffer the same
fate which had befallen the first party.
Finally four of them managed to stag
ger back to safety. The others did
not come out until the third rescue
party was organised and went after
them. It was then that Vandusqn WM
b rough out.
It becamo known today that 1
the tunnel had been suspende
days ago because gas was fou:
men sent into the tunel^lasjiS
went to work believing thefT
been eliminated. .'
"We should never have gone into
the tunel last night" saldfDoUn today* .
"We never got a report fro?Uiexltfe|m
ist whether the place was safe and
cleur of gas but they said it" was al
right for us to go.
