So far Pluto has thrown a dampei
on every county campaign meeting.

r . j
Numbers of auto transfers and
automobiles left Newberry well load- j
ed and those that left early reached
I Whitmire in good time as the meeting
j was not scheduled to start until 2
o'clock p. m.
L The editor of The Herald and News
. and the reporter accompanied by
(Messrs Pope Tompkins and John E.
(-Franklin left 'isewoerry in tne eauor s
car at 11:50 and reached "Whitmire
a little after 3 o'clock. This length
of time was required on account ?f
irigh. water at Indian creek and at
i Duncans creek.
I At Indian creek the editor, who was
at the wheel decided that if a Ford
couldn't ford the sheet of water before
us it was not worthy of being called
a Ford, so we plunged in. Every ,
thing went swimmingly until a deep I
place was reached and the engine was J
browned.
The editor didn't say anything tm\
h the expression on his face was translated
to mean "volunteers wanted/'
Pope Tompkins was the first to
r translate the meaning and! immediately
shucked off his foot gear and
roled up his pants far above Mtj
knees and stepped out into the water.
As the carburetor was above the
water Mr. Tompkins endeavored to
?
crank the engine. He cranked some,
f and prospired some and blowed some
but the engine wouldn't even grunt.
Then Mr. Tompkins gave it up and

Fords disporting in the stream.
About this time Mr. J. W. Epting,
candidate for Sub Supervisor, came

of reaching Whitmire and was^return.
ing to Newberry. Mr. Epting reversed
his car and pulled us out.
r Thence we sped on sometimes on
, 3 cylinders and sometimes on 4 until
we reached Duncan's creek about one
atid a half miles this side Whitmire.
. Here we found a veritable flood running
around the bridge. Leaving ou:

H done already we caught a horse
-drawn vehicle and were carried across
W to the bridge over the main stream j
where we were picked up by another

began to slowly loom up with increasing
proportions as it advancea

Ider the crowds began to disperse,
the Newbery contingent making a
drive for Duncan's creek to get across
before the rain arrived.
At the creek there was a busy scene.
There "were those on foot who had

there were those who were in tTieii.
cars and wanted to find some m^ans of
crossing without getting -'stuck'5
in the water between the

I The Herald and News party fefll into

and we ran about 5 miles on three
cylinders with, the cloud "which wa3
nowalmost overhead threatening to
put us entirely out of commission.
But for this trouble, our party coulu
have reached Indian creek before the
torrents of rain fell which soon made
that creek impassable for the night.
Just as we reached the tome of Mr.
J. 'Will Suber the very bottom of thb
heavens fell out as two clouds met,
one from the direction of Whitmire
land the other from the direction of
Indian creek. To avoid being soaked

found shelter from the down-1
pour. While there we went over the
motor and founds the cause of the
missing cylinder and fixed it.
When the rain had passed sufficiently
to drive we hit the road again
with all four cylinedrs working beautifuly
and visions of home began to
picture themselves before us. But.
these were short lived illusions for aa
we approached iMr. John iM. Suber's
home, Mr. Pittard, the Pepsi-coli
man, flagged us down and informed
us that Indian creek w^s a youn*?
flood and that Ills auto truck was on
the bridge "dead." We threw up oui
hands. A few moments later a big
automobile pulled up behind us and
Sheriff Blease and Mr. Eugene o.
Blease and several other passengers
stepped out.
When told that they could not cros^5
Indian creek Mr. W. S. Melton wlio
was driving the car told of the wash,

'Will Suber's just as the car passed off
the bridge. This was Quite in thrilling
experience. The bridge over Hunting
Fork creek at this place was a wooden
structure about 60 or 70 feet long
and in dry weather is about 10 feet,
above the water, the banks ^heins
from 6 to 8 feet deep. When the
sheriff's party reached the stream
water was over the oridge and running
around on each end. Mr. Melton
made an attempt to cross. When he
dashed through the water and reachAr?

drowned and it stopped on the bridge.
After humoring it a little it pulled.
\
them off the bridge and Just vas the
hind wheels rolled off, the bridge
parted near the middle and floated
down stream. This was a close-call.
A few moments later the party might
have bee thrown into the raging torrents.
It soon became evident that further
travel was out of the question an.i
ample provision was made at the
hospitable homes of Messrs Jno. M. i
/ i
Suber and J. Will Suber for tilt-!
stranded part}-. Tnese "homes are well
provided with all the blessings of a
beautiful providence and the Xewberry
part3T was fortunate in being taken
into the homes of these good men
and their charming families.
On Sunday morning all hope ot i
reaching Newberry by auto, was |
abandoned and >Mr. John M. Suber
provided a wagon and a four mule
team and sent the party to Whitmire
where we were jioned by several
other stranded Xewberrians. The
party entrained at Whitmire at 2:30
and went to Clinton and from thence
to Newberry arriving at 4 o'clock
Sunday afternoon.
On nrrmmf of arrival n? I
the reporter the candidates for the j
senate and Mr. Wheeler and Mr. 'Wilson

Mr. Walter T. Herbert was speaking
and said he would work in the interest
of the farmers and try to secure legislation
