ENTERS HOUSE
The old Arthur Rice house in Li
Ihh), now occupied by Mr. and Mrs.
Christopher Kuhhnaun, was filter
ed hy mi unknown man last Friday
night, who was tindouhtedly bent
on theft, or some other crime; judg
ing i'r.om tin suspicious ciroum
stanees under wliieh he was dis
eovt lid.
At about !') a. in. Mrs. Kuhhnaun
was awakened from a light sleep by
the faint rustling of 1 1 it bedroom
window blind. After a listening
and becoming more and more sus
picious, she awoke her husband,
asking him to turn on the light,
without mentioning her fears. 1m
medietely upon the light being turn
ed on, a crouching figure sprang
up from the lloor and made for the
lu;a rest exist. Illuming with head
half covered by his fore-arm, the
occupants of the room were unable
to see his face and could only ob
serve that he wore a blue stripe
shirt and khaki pants, his feet
being bare. Kuhlmann sprang out
reaching for a loaded shot gun and
chased after the retreating figure, at
whom he lired a charge, not before
he had reached the trees in the
yard, thus preventing sure aim.
No trace of the recreant could be
found, when a search was made
later, nor it is known whether the
charge hit him or not. If hurt to
any considerable extent, he will no
doubt be easily traced, meantime
the police are working upon what
slight clues they have at hand.

BE
ANNIVERSARY
During nearly the whole of his
life Mr. Win. Hyde lliee has been
intimately connected with the Lihue
Hawaiian Church, first as a boy in
the Sunday School, then as a faith
ful attendent anil Sundsy School
worker and now for many years as
wise leader, and a generous patron
as well as at times acting pastor, in
deed the very existence of t li e
church and assuredly its nourishing
prosperity, have been due mainly
to his unfailing interest and effort.
Accordingly it is not to be wond
red at that the seventieth anniver
sary ot ins until hunday last was
recognized and celebrated with af
fectionate regard by the church.
The newly installed minister Rev.
S. Kapu taking for his text the
words of the Psalmist "Thus shall
the man be blessed that fearth the
Lord" dwelt at some length on the
value of such a man to the church
uul community and emphasized
the well merited prosperity which,
as in this ease, came to such a man
a prosperity in which all could re
joice, because it was more or less
shared by all.
A special memorial of apprecia
tion and regard was presented by
Mr. Kapu on behalf of the church,
to which Mr. Rice made an appro
priate response in idiomatic and
graceful Hawaiian. A special Hymn,
composed for the occasion by Mr.
Kapu, and set to music in the form
of a duet and chorus added to the
interest of the event and the chorus
contest choir rendered some of the
fine music prepared for the Hilo
contest.
At the close ot the service, as a
surprise, the congregation were in
vited to participate in an ice cream
cornucopia festival o n the lawn,
where, amid general rejoicing, and
many congratulations a very gener
ous supply of ice cream was made
away with.
Later in the day there was a
family dinner at which the numer
ous relations were gathered, and
later still the Kapaia band tendered
their good wishes and congratula
tions in the form of some choice
music suitable for the occasion.
Cablegrams and wireless messages
o f congratulations 'were received
during the day from friends anibre
latives away from Kauai.
Altogether it was a red letter day,
full of kindliness and good will; the
kind that gives one a new jest in
life and a new faith in humanity.
Macomber- Werner Wedding
A very pretty and well attended
wedding took place last Wednesday
evening at the Ilanalci church when
Elizabeth, the elder daughter of
Deputy Sheriff Werner was married
to Edward P. Macomber of Hono
lulu. The bride was given away by her
father, while Miss Rose Werner
assisted as bridesmaid. John Silva
of Honolulu, ably filled the role of
best man.
To the strains of Lohengrin's
wedding march played by Mrs.
Menefoglio, the procession was led
by charming little flower girls and
the maids of honor, forming a very
pleasing picture within the beauti
fully decorated church. The choir
of the Huialoha Society assisted in
the musical part of the program.
At the conclusion of the church
surviee wliieh was conducted by
Rev. R. Puuki, of Anahola, the
party adjourned to the bride's home
where an elaborate luau waited the
three hundred guests who had gath

The Glass Nuisance on the Pub
lic Roads of Kauai
Koloa, Kauai, July 17th. 11)1(5.
Editor Garden Island:
Could not anything be done to
effectively deal with the glass nui-
anee on our belt road ? It seems to
me that the Chamber of Commerce
or the Board of Supervisor. could
well afford to take up this subject
md enfore some beneficial result
for all concerned; especially the
various Supervisors, each "in his
own district, ought to be able to
abate the frequency of the glass
lying broken on so many places.
Yesterday on the distance between
Koloa and Waimea there were not
less than four places, most of them
where t h e glass liaipl. could
not be avoided, being all over the
road. I had a blowout on a tire
guaranteed for (i(K)0 miles, the rub
ber on which was not half used,
simply on account of a small but
deej) cilt from a glass splinter. If
we had a provision on our statute
books to make it a misdemeanor to
willfully leave glass on the road
and the Supervisors were given au
thority to punish the delinquents,
we would at least be doiiig some
thing to remedy a state of things
from which surely a large number
of innocent outoists suffer consider
able loss.
Yours truly,
Pro bono publico.
