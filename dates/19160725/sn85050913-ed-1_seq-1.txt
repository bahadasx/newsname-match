Everybody TS quite as well as
might be expected. Twenty-eight
'men, beside the thirty on guard du
ty, were working today on special
details, preparing for departure.
When the cars get out here, less than
two hours will be needed to load and
entrain.
We do not anticipate a very pleas
ant journey, but1 we hope to have
sleepers. The Third was sent out in
sleepers.
Camp Dodge, July 22.—The first
battalion of the Second is waiting to
entrain. It is now 5 o'clock. We
have been waiting since 3:30. By
tomorrow morning the First Regi
ment will be in sole possession of
the camping grounds, as far as in
fantry is concerned.
We are glad that we are moving,
and yet we aro already looking back
to the time spent here as the most
pleasant period of our army life. Ev
erybody is well. The after effects of
vaccination have generally run their
course.
Our routing is as follows: C. B.
Q. to Kansas City Frisco to Denison,
Texas Houston and Texas Central
to Houston, Texas St. Louis.
Brownsville ft Mexico to Browns
ville. This is official.
The enlisted men are to have tour
ist sleepers. The officers are to be
provided with standard sleepers.
Baggage cars have been made into
kitchen cars. We are assured of hot,
substantial meals during the whole
trip. Six days rations have been pro
vided, although we are due in three
to five days. Our commissary is de
termined that we shall not experi
ence the hardships endured by the
guardsmen of other states, who quite
frequently were without anything to
eat for many hours.
Our kitchen was put aboard the
car this morning. We messed at
the Bwitch. The band was unfort
unate today, getting no dinner what
ever. They are promised "some
fefed" tonight to make it up.
Somebody "showed up" the band
last night. Although they sleep
nearly every day, they sleep soundly
at night also. This morning a doz
en of the band boys awoke to dis
cover that a nice clean swath had
'been clipped on their heads. They
accuse their barber, saying that he
was drumming up business.1 The af
flicted ones had their heads clipped
this morning. Can you Imagine
Berggren minus his beloved pompa
dour! His scalp is uncovered to cur
ious eyes for the first time since we
knew him. The boys would make a
very interesting study for a phrenol
ogist. No need to feel the "bumps."

married, were not taken with their
regiment Saturday night when the
Second left Des Moines for the bqr
der, but that these men will after a
few weeks receive their discharge

CELEBRATE GOLDEN WEDDING
WEBSTER CITY, IOWA TUESDAY, JULY 25, 1916.
ARE KIT DISCHARGED
Appears That the War Department
Was Only Bluffing in Regard
to This Matter.
Register and Leader: Though re
quests and appeals have been made
for the honorable discharge of twen
ty men from the ranks of the Iowa
troops and six of the cases were re
ferred to the war department at
Washington, not a one of the men
iias been dismissed. When the Third
regiment left yesterday it carried
with It several men for whom appli
cations for discharge were made.
The troops are wondering If the
war department Intends to stand by
its statement tuade through Secre
tary of War ljtyker on July in
which he said all soldiers with de
pendent families would be discharg
ed from th£ service.
Among the people at large it is the
opinion that the men can get out of
the service if they want to. This is
not true. One captain has advanced
the opinion that the reason the men
are not discharged is that it might
cause a wholesale stampede for re^
leases.
Many of the cities of Iowa are do
Ing the proper thing by the men by
guaranteeing td take care of their
families while they are away and
firms are holding jobs open for the
boys. Bait many of the wives and
mothers have gtfne to work at mere
pittances to keep the "wolf from the
door. .• iV
As yet there has been no payday
for the soldiers though they have
been mobilized for thirty-two days,
The Red Cross army war relief
comilVtttfte of Moines 'is issuing
another cal| for funds. C. L. Her
ring and Asnton Clemens, chairman
and vice chairman, respectively, have
sent circular letters and blanks to
every business man In town asking
for aid.
More appeals for help are being
received every day and the funds re
ceived so far have not been suffic
ient to meet the demands.

An item recently appeared in these
columns relative to the golden wed
ding celebration of Mr. and Mrs.
Wm. McDonald, well known old

EDITOR OF BOY'S LIFE
VISITS THIS CITY
Walter P. McGuire of New York is
Guest of Attorney 0. J.
Henderson.
Walter P. McGuire of New York
City, editor of Boy's Life and Scout
ing, monthly publications dealing
with the Interests of Boy Scouts, ar
rived here Saturday afternoon and
spent Sunday with his old college
friend, Attorney O. J. Henderson,
while on his return to New York City
from a business and vacation trip to
Minneapolis and St. Paul. Messrs.
McGuire and Henderson were room
mates wl»en attending the UniVerptfy
of Minnesota.
Had all boy scouts of Webster City
been apprised of Editor McGuire's
visit here there would no doubt have
been "something doing." Scout
master Murry McMurray knew about
it but the majority of the boys were
kept in ignorance of it. The gen
tleman who edits these magazines,
which are of so much interest to the
average boy, is jolly and full of life.
He Is small of stature, very young for
an editor, and just the sort of a fel
low whom the scouts would take a
liking to. Before becoming editor
of these magazines, Mr. McGuire
was Sunday editor of the St. Paul Pi
oneer Press.
The scouts are much interested in
The Cave Scout," a contributor who
conducts a page in Boy's Life each
month. Many people have been
curious to know who wrote these
clever stories. Mr. McGuire says
the "cave scout" is his brother-in
law, Fred Patton, a bit of Informa
tion which will be of great interest
to all who read Boy's Life.
