International Now Fervlce:
WASHINGTON. July 2 5. A new
offensive, movement is to be launch
ed by the republicans in the senate
;m.iinst the administration's Mexican
policy. As a result of letters to sen
ators from all parts of the country,
resolutions arc in preparation de
manding the withdrawal of the na
tional guard from the border ami to
prevent the further movement of
troops southward.
Sen. Tall of New Mexico, who has
furnished the republicans with am
munition for their assaults on the
president's course in Mexico, return
ed yesterday from a month's isit
j.lon the border. He brought in
lormation of his observations thero
to aid his republican colleague in
their attacks on the Mexican policy.
Why Was Guard Sent?
"Why was the national guard ever
sent?" Is the burden of many of
the letters received by senators and
a demand for an explanation from
the whi.e house probably will bo
contained in one of the resolutions
now in preparation. Sen. Townsend
of Michigan, who esterday attack
ed the maintenance of the guard on
the b order. declares there is conclu
de proof that the administration
i ever intended to use the guards
men for "cleaning up Mexico."
Republican leaders see in tho
present situation abundant campaign
material. They claim the adminis
tration has injured itself immeasur
ably by calling out the national
guard while the democratic leaders
rejoice that the president has been
nble to keep his peace record ( b ar.
lie republicans, however, outend
tl
l.it the country wants the .Mexican
mention permanently settled and
that the sending of the guard to tho
t order has done mulling towards a
final soluUon of the problem.

United States Will Purchase
Danish West Indies For
$25,000,000 Officials Admit
Icternntional News Service:
WASHINGTON, July 25. White
house officials today confirmed the
statement that the United Mates will
purchase the Danish West Indies for
approximately $20,000,000.
It was stated that the negotiations
which have been in progress for
nearly two years, are about complet
ed. The text of the proposed pur
chase treaty has been agreed upon, it
was stated, and the signatures of the
two nations are to be affixed in the
near future.
As soon as the treaty is completed
it will be sent to the senate here and
th Danish parliament fo ratifica
tion. Oiticials declare that there is
no doubt that the document will he
approved by both.
Hy purchasing the Danish West
Indies, the United States will secure
possession of what officials say is the
most strategic group of islands in
connection with the Panama an.il
The negotiations for the acquisi
tion by the United Mates of these
islands were commenced soon after
the outbreak of the present Kuro
pean war when rumors reached the
United States that Germany had
made an offer for then:. There was
a hitch as a result of the failure of
the two governments to reach an
agreement on the price to he paid.
Since then the negotiations have con
tinued, but recently the Danish gov
ernment expressed a willingness to
"do business" inasmuch as the col
onies had proved unprofitable. The
island? have become a source of sorbins-
expense and as a result the

GIRL IS DEAD OP
Farmer's Son Held in Connec
tion With Death of
Paoli, Ind., Girl.
lutemational Xws ServPe:
OLXEY, 111., July 25. "Air in the
crteries" is declared hy reputable
physicians to have caused the death
of 17-year-old Klizaleth Katcllffe,
Into whose death a coroner's jury
today began an inquest. Held with
out bail is Hoy Hinterliter. son of
a well-to-do farmer. After an
autopsy had revealed that the girl
was about to become a mother, but
that there was no evidence of an
operation nor of poison, physicians
were mystified. But when the route
cer which Hinterliter and his sweet
heart took their last drive before he
brought her to a sanitarium, dead,
was retraced, an instrument was
found which, according to. State's
AUy. Morris, might have been used
in an attempt at an operation, and
w hich might account for air in the
arteries.
When Hinterliter -was held, rich
friends and relatives offered bail,
t ut it was refused and the state's
attorney declared that he expected
to unearth one of the most unusual
cases on record.
Miss HatcllfTe came here from
Paoli. Ind.. to visit a sister, Mrs.
Pert Fancher. She was attractive
and Hinterliter had paid her much
attention. Saturday night, after a
drive, he brought her to the Olney
sanitarium, saing she had fainted
during the trip. She was dead.

DETENTION METHODS
AID ENGLISH TRADERS
American Goods Are Held Up
and British Fill Orders,
is Claim Vigorous
Protest Planned.
Iutemati nal News Service:
WASHINGTON, July 20. Nearly
every existing trade treaty between
Great Britain and the United states
has been violated by that nation in
her assaults upon American com
mercial rights which now has cul
minated in the ereation of a black
list of more than SO American bus
iness concerns and business men.
State department oiticials made this
plain today in rejecting the sugges
tions contained in the cable message
from London that England has a
perfect right to say who her sub
ject? shall and shall not trade with.
It is now plain that the extreme
seriousness of the situation is not
realized in London. The series of
inquiries addressed to the foreign
oilice on behalf of the United States
by Ambassador Page there have
gone unanswered. And according
to the statements made to the de
partment here by the British ambas
sador. Sir Cecil Spring-Pice, he has
as yet been unable to get any com
plete information as to the scope of
the British movement.
Britisli Irofiled.
It is claimed that the British de
tention methods have been utilized
to the last to aid British exporters.
Under the guise of "ascertaining
ownership" large consignments of
goods sent to neutral nations have
been held up in ships detained in
British territorial waters. It now
Is alleged that in many cases while
these 'were held for investigation
British merchants in similar lines
sent along shipments to till the or
ders, with the result that the goods
originally shipped were not accepted
by the consignee because of the de
lay. The loss to Americans from
this source is said to be very grt
and complaining lirms have been
directed to send along all lata avail
able to oe incorporated in the com
ing protest.
It again was made plain at both
the white house and the state de
partment today that, while the ad
ministration is very anxious to make
its complete protest without de
lay, it has been found necessary to
move slowly because of the inabil
ity to force prompt action in fur
nishing the facts from Great Brit
ain. The president has promised
callers that vigorous protest will be
made and that this government will
Insist on all existing trade treaties
being observed under all circum
stances. To Press For Action in Mail Cuo.
Meanwhile this government will
continue to press for action on the
mail hold-ups at both London and
Paris. The mail detention is a very
vital part of the genera! British
protest 2nd this government has all
along insisted that under no circum
stances will it consent to any recog
nition of the rights of belligerents to
divert mail carrying essels into
their territorial waters and then in
sist that they have the rUht of ex
amination and confiscation.
In the entire matter of trade In
terference by mail and otherwise,
officials say that this government
has sufficient information available
for a preliminary protes:t and the
president and his cabinet are being
urged by senators and commercial
representatives to send this prelim-'
inary demand without delay and
later supplement it when all the
facts are, available. This probably
will be done if there is continuation
of the present delay.
