HATS MAKE MEN BALD?
NO, SAYS GIRL STUDENT
Hairless Women Often F:ool
Bachelors, She Asseris.
Washinpton, July *.?' MlSfl Porothy
Oebora, of ohio state- i'niversity. has
1 made a study of baldhoudrd men and
' aromefl and make? her m BMwhal
cynica! report Ifl the Aupust ".lournnl
of Heredity." Hats nre r.o more fo
blane for baid heads than is the wool
of -hecp responsible for horns, ahe
found. She reached tbe defir.ite con
e'.usion that baldness cannot be
achieved; the baid are born and not
made.
In support of her anti-hat theory
Miss Osborn asserts that baldness in
women ia more frequent than most
bachelors will believe. "because- women
can conceal their baldness much more
easily than men."
Through heredity, however, n man
stands twice the chance of beinp baid
than a woman does. A man, Miss
< Osborn aays, falls heir to fallinp hair
if either of his parents had that
tendency, while n womnn becomes baid
only if both parents were.
"This peculinr modr of inheritnncc,"
lha aaplalBB, "is called sex limited, the
quality bctr.p dominant in malrs nriai
recessive in females. It wns found by
Dr. Thomas R. Arkell to hold pood for
thc horns of sheep."

Baltiaaera, July 24. There was a
sudden breakin? down of barricades on
tha piers of thc Deutschland this cv.-n
inp and the sharp, f-ray B084 <?f the
submnrii.e was thrust out preparatory
for its final dash for the Atlantic.
At B late hour to-nif-ht the dash had
not yet been made, but an ominous
movement BflfleBg numerous boats up
and down the Fatapsco Kiver proved
that the perilous cruise of the I'-boat
would be started under many hostile

enemy boats that bad penetrated thus
far into neutral waters to watch their

London. July 24.?While the
German lines along the Dvina were
crumplinp up before one of the
preatest and most furious attacka
of the war, the Kaiser and his chief
of staff were to-day rushinp with all
speed toward the scene of the latest
(ierman disaster, oblivious for the
time beinp to all developments on
the western front.
London to-nipht recalls nothinp
of more sipnificance in the last year
of fiphtinp than this sudden move.
Tlie (ierman war lord has at last
piven notice that the preat Russian
nrenace overshadows all el-,?. To
many military critics he has piven
fresh proof that Germany believes
the war will be decided in the East
:ather than on the Somm". In his
hasty departure for the Russian hat?
tle line London reads a tacit ackr.owl
rdj-cment of tbe danper which is con
frotiting the Teutonie Allies at al
m^Ft every point alonp the wide
llui.p front from Ripa to thc Car
patbian wall.
I'enel rates Twelve Miles.
Drivinp a wedpe of steel throuph
the breach he made yesten'ny in the
enemy's lines south of Ripa, General
Kuropatkin to-i'ay swept Von Hin
denburp's forces back alonp a front
of thirty miles, and to a depth. at
one point, of twelve miles. Not
since the preat Russian offensive be
pan have tha Gzar's troops won such
a wide stretch of territory at one
stroke.
That reports of this important ad?
vance have reached London only
throuj-h unofficial channels and are not
icmtirmed in any way by the Russian
official communiijues is regarded here
ns only natural. At the present stage
of the drive in the north, when the
(Ierman lines have not yet been vitally
irushed in and the real crisis of the
battla is still to rome, the policy of the
Russian command, it is pointed out,
would be to maintain strict silenee.
The Czar is not claiminfr nny vie
tories until he is certain they will not
Middenly be turned into routs. It is
not necessary to feed the Russian peo?
pie on imaginary sucosses when tan
fible successes are almost at hand -
that is the manner in which army men
h?re explain the paucity of official
.?tatements from Petroprad on the new
drive.
Admiration for Russia f.rowa.
Dcspite the successes of the Rritish
troops in Frnnce and the interest which
naturally attaches to all their move
ments, the Knglish peopie are now di
viding their attention between the two
greal fronts. Admiration for the Rus

Yankee Fliers Fool Enemy
by Diving into Cloud Bank
Rockwell and Hail Escape from Hot Battle by Trick?
Four American Drivers Cited for
French War Cross.
By FRED B. PITNEY.
Paris, July 24.?Two pilota of the
American eseadrille Serpeant Kiffen
Rockwell and Adjutant Bert Hail-flnd
ing themielves trapped by five German
machines over hoatile territory laat
Friday pcrpetrated a Yankee trick on ;
UM enemv and slipped back to the ;
safety of their own lines.
Rockwell and Hail durinp the after- [
noon spied an aviatik flyinp alone and '
immediately rose in their Nieuport--, !
eaper for battle with thia latest type j
of German aeropiane. It was a new
model of an old aviatik, capable of hiph
speed and carryinp two men and two
machine puns.
Rockwell arrived near the enemy I
first and, cirding, riddled him with
machine pun fire. Although it did not
kill the pilot, lt pierced the aviatik in
a vulnerable spot and foreed the Ger?
man to descend. Rockwell, watchinp
the machine fall, did not realize that
two Fokkers were behind him until the
winps of his Nieuport were riddled
with bullets.
Hail immediately joined battle, but a
few minutes later a third, then a fourth
and a fifth Fokker cloaed in on the pair
of Americans, who found the battle
prowinp too hot for them, with no
chance of reinforcements and far from
the home lines.
Then came the Yankee trick. The
BRANDEIS LEAVES
JEWISH SOCIETIES
Justice Retires from Amer?
ican Relief Board and
Hebrew Congress.
Boston, July 24. Justice Brandeia,
of the I'nited States Supreme Court,
to-day tendered his resignation from
the executive committee of the Ameri?
can Jewish Relief Organization and the
Jewish Congress. In explanation his
secretary, Jaeob de Maas, said that the
Ljastice'a judicial duties prevented him
from giving the necessary time to the
work of the committees.
Mr. l?e Haas said that a report that
Justice Brandeis was considering re?
tirement from all Jewish activities was
incorreet and that he still retained in?
terest in various organizations.
The justice started to-d-_y for a va
cation of ten days, leaving instructions
that he was not to be disturbed mean?
while by telephone calls, according to
; his secretary.
Justice Brandeis, it is gaid, considers
that it would be unwise for him in
future to expose himself and his high
office to the sort of criticism with which
; he met at the Hotel Astor recently. Iti
was recallcd that at that meeting one
pa-rson called at Justice Brandeis. in a
ileriiive tone, "There are higher things
than the Supreme Court of the United
States," whereupon the justice left the
I meeting aniid hisses
Friends of Justice Brandeis admitted
I last night that the idea of his retire
' ment from Jewish activities was not
: new to them, but uniformly they re?
fused to believe that he had ac.ually
severed the many threads that bound
him to the larger social and religious
movements in Jewry.
"We have all heard somethinp about
it," said Abraham S Schomer last
night, "but you can say for me that I
do not believe it."
Former Judge Leon Sanders was
! eqaally emphatic in refusing to give
! any credence to the report.
"I do not believe it," he said. "1
can see no reason why a man, because
he has been appointed to the Supreme
Court of the I'nited States, or to any
other bench, should withdraw from all
his former social activities and with
hold his support from great religious
ar.d phi'.anthropic movements.
"I say all this in splte of the fact
that certain New York newspapers
have editonally cond.mn.d Justice
Brr.ndeis'i activities in the affair.. of
his peopie since beeoming a I'nited
States Supreme Court justice, and *he
announcement of his possible retire?
ment comes Irom a newspaper."
Justice Brandeis has beeen one of
the most enthusiaitie workers for the
welfare of the Jews in this country.
He has been an active advocate of the
i Zionist movement. He was a delegate
of the Jev.ish Congresi Committee and
chairman of the provisional committee
j of seventy appointed by the Jewish
Conference in Philadelphia last March.
Americans were fighting about fi.OO"
feet in the air and a heavy cloud bank
was near them. Manneuvring into thii
bank, they dove out of sight, leavinf
the enemy machines on the other side
of the thick veil, unable to reach their
prey.
Kventually the pair arrived home,
their machines wet with mist and
searred with bullets, but safe.
Another American, Pau! Pavelka, has
just been ordered to join the escadrille
and leave. for the front to-morrow.
Four American ambulance drivera
are cited to receive the Croix de
Guerre John W. Clark, of Flur-hing;
L H. Wheeler, of Yonkers; Kverett
.lackson, of Colorado Springs, and
Thomas W. Potter, of Westchester.
To-day's French otlicial report on I
aerial operations says:
"During the night a German aviator
dr*7*"pped bombs on Luneville. One per?
son was wounded. Sub-Lieutenant
Chaput brought down yesterday his
eigfcth enemy aeroplane, which fell
near Fresnes-en-Woevre. A second
Geraean machine which was attacked |
fell near Fort Vaux.
"On the night of July 22-23 and dur- ;
ing the day of July 23 our aeroplanes
dropped eight shells on the railroad
station at Conflans, fortv on the bar
racks near Vigneulles and twenty-f.ve

"The bombardment in preparation
fOT thc infantry attack began at 2 a. m. j
on the morning of the memorable July
?I a day which will survive in history.
The Knglish used every piece in their
possession, from hand grenades to
heavy tield artiilery, and kept up a
continual tiring throughout the night.
"It waa an awe rnspirmg sight to
watch the venemous spit-fire of the
heavy calibre pieces momentanly
pieree the mky darkness, and then
gradually fade. At I o'ciock the firingr
suddenly ceased, when through the
rifts of low hanging smoke the great
havoc wrought on the German positions
could be easily seen with t'reld glasses.

"A few moments later 1 watched wave
after wave or khaki clad soldiers
iwarm over the British tirst line
trenches and charge up the steep slope
leading to Contalmaison. The right and
left flanks pushed on, while the centre
was lost to view in a curtain of t.re,
which the (iermans threw behind the
charging liaee, to prevent the ma.ssins
of reinforcements. A few moments
later many trgures were seen in fliirh".
"At first we thought the attack hai
failed, and that the Rritish were .???
treating, but soon we saw that they
were bands of German prisoners being
passed back through the lines."
"The battle continued untrl I o'ciock

Scene Shiftcd Often.
Th" battle, said Mr. Allen, unlrke
Verdun, which he had recently seen,
was exceptionally interesting. as the
scene was continually ehanging, A con?
tinual stream of monition vans, dis
che.rging ther cargo to the waiting
gunr.a-r-.; thc opproaeh of large num
berg of reinforeem.-iits, massed behind
a hill out of sight of the Germans,
waiting the order to go into battle and
relieve their comrades; the crash and
rour of artillerjr, ever tengthepiag th.-ir
trajectory to keep ahead of the advai.c
mg troops; the moving of heavy field
i; the stndfiit vvhrnnying of
wounded horses all contributed to a
memorable spectacle.

had a narrow escape, as a battery fifty
