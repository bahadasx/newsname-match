new waterworks tunnel, it was es
timated at one o'clock today when
workmen were trapped in a gas pock

machinery, exploded with terrific
force.
Ten bodies of t'le victims have been
taken from the death hole. These
wete members of three rescue parties
who descended into the death trap,
although they had no helmets. Res

dead in the tunnel. Ten escaped with
injuries.

Carelessness Contributory Canse.
Failure to make proper tests of gas
strength, and lack of sufficient, air
pressure in the tube were pointed out
as contributing causes of the disaster.
It was seven hours after the acci
dent before pulmotors and helmets
were secured. It was two hours be
fore help arrived. Three men taken
from the tunnel died before pulmotors
arrived. A triple probe, by city,
county and state officials, will be held
to fix the cause and responsibility for
the disaster. Officials will meet Mon
day with Mayor Davts to set the time
for the inquest and inquiry.
Capt. Hans Hansen of the United
States life saving station was the first
on the scene, but he had no helmets
or pulmotors, so went back for them.
Two small boats from the ore freight
er. Star of Jupiter, next arrived but
they had no apparatus with which to
cope with the deadly fumes.
None of 11 In Tube Escaped.
Finally word was telephoned from
shore to C. C. Van Dusen, superin
tendent of tunnel work. He gathered
a gang of workmen, seized a tug and
led in tho rescue work.
The dead include workmen who
were trapped in the tunnel when gas
exploded and members of two rescue
parties who attempted to save the men
first trapped.
Of the dead, eleven were in the
force trapped by the explosion. None
of them escaped. The first rescue
party consisted of seven men. Four
of them perished and three were
saved. The second rescue party com
prised eleven men. Six of these lost
their lives and five escaped.
The first rescue party accomplished
nothing. The second saved one mem
ber of the first relief expedition. No
one has yet reached any of the orig
inal eleven caught in the workings. Of
the eight rescuers who got out alive,
two died later. Another may die.
The explosion occurred about a
hundred feet from the crib in a new
tunnel which will connect with the
big filtration plant recently erected on
the west fide. Ten men were caught
in the shaft.

turned a verdict holding Roy Hinter

testimony before the jury disclosed the
Ratcliffe girl died of air in the ar

there by Hinterliter in an attempt to
perform an illegal operation.
The method, which officials say
Hinterliter used in his attempts to per
torm the operation, is very unusual.
Examination of the girl's body dis
closed a very strange condition, and
only after a thorough investigation
were they able to learn the author

perform the operation by using a
pump.
Said She Had Swooned.
The limp body of the 15 year old
girl was brought to a sanitarium
here late Friday night by Hinterliter,
who asked the authorities to revive
her. All efforts failed. The young

" " jimeiiuaD iraae was reacnea
the banks referred to said the United
States would profit. Many of the
blacklisted firms the British officials
pointed out have been maintaining
Germany's trade relations with South
America and -were in a position to do
so only because they were domiciled
in a neutral country.
With the boycott in force, it is
claimed that practically the only com
petition against American business
would be removed and that the busi
ness outlook for those banks which
recently have established branches in
South America and are now training
many employes in New York for that
field would be materially brightened.
Trade Won't Diminish.
In discussing the blacklist with the
bankers the British officials pointed
out that there would be practically
no diminution in American trade but
only a transfer of the business of for
eign firms from the boycotted houses
to others not under ban. On the oth
er hand they said the necessity of
British firms being relieved of the
uncertain character of their Ameri-
can connections, required the publi
cation of the blacklist. This situa
tion may result in strong pressure be
ing brought to bear on the govern
ment by the powerful financial in
terests which will benefit by the
blacklist, to prevent any drastic ac
tion against England being taken.
A vigorous protest to the British
government is expected to go forward
to the London foreign office today.
The United States government's
protest is expected to admit that
Gret Britain has a legal right to ad-
vise her subjects in and out of British
territory against dealing with the en
emy or dealing with neutral countries
of Europe because their goods might
find their way into the enemy's lines.
But, the right of the British govern
ment to interfere with the tra.de of
neutral residents of neutral countries
with Great Britain's enemies by apply
ing the boycott to them will be vigor
ously opposed.
As outlined by authorities, the com
munication to the British government
will contain these features:
A statement that the action of JJreat
Britain toward American firms is ar-
bitrar-v and violative of the "tradition-
al spirit of the conditions of com
i merce between the two countries."
j An assertion that the selection of in
dividual cases for blacklist without
proof of guilty connection with the in
terests of Great Britain's enemies is
discriminatory and therefore violative
essentially of the comity between the
United States and Great Britain.
Kquity Action.
A warning that the United States
regards the imposition of such hard
ships on American individuals and
corporations as a basis for an equity
of action for claims against Great
Britain by the interested parties.
A declaration that the United
States, pending a reply from Great
Britain, reserves the right to take such
steps as it deems proper to safeguard
all cases which are not fairly within
the rights of Great Britain to prevent
her own subjects from dealing with
the enemy.
Thus far state department officials
will not admit the United States is
prepared to listen to any overtures
from European nations for joint ac
tion to compel the British government
to abandon its present course.
Chevalier Van Rappard, the Nether
lands minister, was again at the state
department conferring with Acting
Secretary Polk. The Netherlands gov
ernment is vitally interested in what
steps the United States may take. The
Scandinavian countries, particularly
Sweden, are known to be greatly de
sirous of launching some form of Joint
action to preserve neutral rights.

A
PATCH 0F GREEN
It Shows That the Dentschland
-Still Is There.
Eyerything Favorable for De
parture, but She Stays.
Baltimore, Md., July 25. A little
patch of green visible through a driv
ing rain told watchers today that the
German sub-sea freighter Deutsch
land, like the Star Spangled Banner,
was still there.
What had prevented her from head
ing for the capes overnight, as ap
parently planned, was more mysterious
than all the dope dreams and t"
ories connected with this submarine
venture.
Moves at her dock overnight made
it seem certain at least more nearly
certain than ever before that shj was
going at once.
But after the first maneuvers of
the early night, calm settled over the
pier, the tug Timmina only occasion
ally flashed her searchlight out into
the storm and the Neckar and
Deutschland crews attended Oivine
service and then a banquet aboard
the Neckar.
Strangely enough the Timmins early
today remained at the edge of the log
boom, which guards the Deutschland.
Heretofore she had ducked back be
hind the cordon of barges at about 4
a. m., after completing her search
light vigil. All that is needed for a
dash is to open the front of the boom,
snake out one barge, throw a tow line
to the Deutschland and turn into the
middle branch of the Patapsco. Mani
festly the submarine is ready in every
sense of the word for a quick getaway.
Whether the promoters of the new
submarine line actually fear for the
Deutschland's sister ship, the Bremen,
is something they alone know. It ap
peared likely today, however, that they
have very little information as to her
course. The most likely thing seemed
to be that the Deutschland will go
down to the capes and lie there in
wait for her. unless indeed she is
taking a northerly course toward Bos
ton, thereby drawing away the allied
patrol from the capes and permitting
easier egress for the Deutschland.
Conference on Deutschland.
Despite the mass of misinformation
surrounding the Deutschland's ven
ture, it leaked out today that Bern
storff. Consul Luderitz and others plan
to meet here. Unless the Deutsch
land's siflter ship Bremen is reported
safe in the meantime, the subject of
their session, it is assumed, will be on
the matter of either indefinitely in
terning the Deutschland or making a
bold run for home -taking chances
with the allied patrol off .the capes.
The whereabouts of the Bremen be
gins to give some uneasiness, though
she has not been out sufficiently long
to make it at all certain that she has
met with mishap. If the Bremen has
had trouble, the Deutschland may de
cide to avoid it by an indefinite stay.
The Deutschland promoters stood
ready to shoot out at a moment'? no
tice. The Deutschland tug Timmins
had steamed up; the path was ciear
and all that was necessary was for
the Timmins to pull a switch and
make a run.

suggested by rumors that a convoy of
armed German submarines also awaits
a short distance outside the three mile
limit, has aroused such interest that
owners if strong small vessels capable

of putting out twenty miles or more
are flooded with offers from private
parties for the use of their ooats.
Many government officials, too, are
making ready to take up the trail of
the Deutschland whenever she comes
down the bay. Added to all of these
crafts, many small yachts and motor
boat are preparing to follow the big
submersible out to sea.
The new allied warship, thought to
be a British scout cruiser, which first
appeared on the front .line of patrol
yesterday and relieved a French ship,
continued its lone vigil today.
In German circles it was believed
that the Bremen, sister ship to the
Deutschland, either had been headed
off by allied ships or had suffered an
accident.
GUAWlllOT
U. S. Regulars Fire on Disor
derly Negro Soldiers.
Four Wounded Made Attack
on White Ciyilian.
San Antonio, Tex., July 25. Three
negro soldiers of Company E, Eighth
Illinois infantry, were in the hospital
today as the result of bullet wounds
received when they were fired upon
by the provost guard last r.ight. after
attacking H. G. Henne. a lawyer of
New Braunfels, Tex. A fourth was
taken to b.i-3 tent.
The wounded are:
William Blue, shot in the groin.
Edward Lightborne, flesh wound in
the right thigh.
Sidney Williams, left leg broken be
low the knee.
Unidentifed trooper, removed to the
regimental camp.
All are privates. The wounds are
comparatively slight, owing to the
guard having used "guard" ammuni
tion, a light charge with a maximum
range of about 300 yards.
Threw Rock at Auto.
The trouble started when Henne
was driving his automobile past a
group of the negro militiamen. Henne
says a stone was thrown, striking the
back of the car. He stopped and went
back to ascertain who threw the stone.
He said he was met with threats and
invective. He ran toward a nearby
saloon, followed by the guardsmen.
By the time he reached the saloon,
his pursuers are said to have number
ed thirty or forty. He seized a tobacco
cutter and knocked down the first
negro through the door, he says. A
second he kicked in the groin. At
this Jucture the provost guard, com
posed of the Nineteenth United States
infantrymen, arrived. With clubbed
guns they forced the negroes into the
street.
The negroes are said to have made
a stand in the street, after withdraw
ing some distance from the saloon.
Upon their failure to obey repeated
orders to return to their quarters, they
were fired upon by the guard. Four
of them fell and the remainder re
treated. Citizens Let Army Settle It.
Citizens were disposed to regard the
incident as purely a matter for the
military to settle and there has been
no deminstration against negroes as
a result of the affair. Army officials
of the Southern department are in
vestigating, preparatory to a court
martial. Heard Insults, Say Xegroes.
Members of the Eighth Illinois
negro regiment involved in the little
riot told officers investigating the in
cident that they had been goaded into
a display of their resentment by the
series of derogatory remarks made to
them by the white soldiers and civil
ians as they passed along the street.
A thorough investigation waa under
way today.

Galloway drank carbolic acid early
this morning and thirty minutes later
was dead. He committed suicide at
the home of his son, H. A. Galloway,
at 372 Green street
Mr. Galloway was 80 years of age,
was almost totally blind and has been
in failing health for some time. Only
a few days ago he remarked to his
son: "I wish the Lord would take me
away."
At 6:40 o'clock this morning his
daughter-in-law, Mrs. H. A. Galloway,
was cooking breakfast. The old gen
tleman was sitting upon the side of his
bed.
"What shall I do?" he asked.
"What's the matter, grandpa?" ask
ed Mrs. Galloway.
"I've taken carbolic acid," he re
plied. "Goodbye, Mary."
He held the empty bottle in his
hand. He became unconscious im
mediately. A physician was called but
at 7:10 o'clock, thirty minutes after
he had swallowed the poison, Mr. Gal
loway died.
O. F. Marcotte, coroner, was called
but he stated this afternoon that no
Inquest will be necessary.
"It was a clear case of suicide," he
said.
The body is at the Shellabarger un

Washington, July 25. Negotiations
for the purchase of the Danish West
Indies by the United States will prob
ably be closed today. Consideration
is approximately $25,000,000, it was
stated officially at the White House.
The negotiations have been carried on
by the state department and the Dan
ish foreign office.
While details of the treaty were not
given out it is understood that the
United States would come into com
plete possession of the islands. Word
has been received from Denmark that
the treaty is practically certain o be
ing ratified by the Danish parliament.
Chairman Stone of the senate foreign
relations committee saw President
Wilson today but said afterwards he
had not discussed the purchase of the
Danish West Indies and knew nothing
of the question. It is understood the
government hopes the treaty will be
ratified during the present session of
congress.
Negotations Since Civil War.
The three islands of the Danish
West Indies St. Croix, St. Thomas
and St. John lie due east of Porto
Rico and their value to the United
States is strategic from a military
point of view.
The harbors of St. Thomas and St.
Croix are of first importance to the
American navy and St. Thomas itself
lies in the lane of shipping from
Europe to the Panama canal.
Important German. French and
English mail companies have coaling
stations there. The acquisition of the
islands by the United States has been
the subject of unsuccessful diplo
matic negotiations since the Civil war.
Secretary Seward began negotia
tions for their acquisition in 1865 be
cause the naval operations of Lhe war
had shown the necessity of a base in
the West Indies. A treaty was made
and ratified bv Denmark but tne
United States senate failed -to act on
it in proper time ana - it- )wu
President Wilson, In his volume of
congressional government; :.- written
about 1883, referred to the incident as
"the treaty marring power of the
senate." Ineffectual efforts were made
to reopen the negotiations during
President Grant's administration and
in 1902 soon after President Roose
velt came into office Secretary Hay
took up the subject and Denmark of
fered the islands for five millions.
Had German Opposition.
The United States senate this time
ratified the treaty but the Danish sen
ate defeated it. It was said at the
time in diplomatic circles that German
opposition influential in the Danish
parliament was responsible for the de
feat of the plan. Later Judgment,
however, attributed the opposition to
Danish aristocrats. This opposition
still is said to exist, and it is said, that
if the proposed treaty is ratified by
both governments the transfer will be
submitted to the people of the islands.
In the first negatiations in 1865 they
approved a change.
The three islands of St. Croix. St.
Thomas and St. John in the order of
their size and population were dis
covered by Columbus In 1493. Spanish,
British, French, Dutch and Danish
flags have floated over one or all the
islands at various times. St. Croix,
lying sixty-five miles southeast of
Porto Kico, has an area of eighty-four
square miles, and is the most prosper
ous of the group, with its two towns
of Christianstad and Frederikstad. It
was held at one time by the Knights
of Malta, having been given to that
fa -nous order by Louis XIV of Franca,
Important Trade Center.
St. Thomas, which lies only forty
miles east of Porto Rice and is less
than 100 miles from the entrance to the
Panama canal, was at one time the
chief distributing center of West In
dian trade, its importance being di
rectly due to the fact that the mother
country, Denmark, maintained its neu
trality during the numerous European
wars of the eighteenth century
Charlotte Amalie, with a population of
less than 10,000, mainly negroes, is
still an important coaling station for
steamers in the West Indian trade.
With a depth of from twenty-five to
thirty-six feet of water, the roadstead
can accommodate the largest mer
chant ships. St. John, least important
of the islands, lying four miles to the
east of St. Thomas, has an area of
twenty-one square miles. Crux Bay,
a village of 1,000 inhabitants on the
northern shore, is the center of popu
lation. While Danish is the official lan
guage of the islands. English is quite
generally spoken. Not infrequently

If Denmark decides to part with the
islands there will remain to her only
two colonial possessions Greenland
and Iceland.
Naval officers regard the Danish
iWest Indies as most valuable for any
rjuiujjiii Kvvfrnment wisning to
quarrel with the United States and
have urged that it was essential to
keep them from falling into unfriend
ly hands. They have pointed out that
they are very near the naval station
at Guantanamo. only a thousand
miles from Key West, and a menace
to the free navigation of the Wind
ward and Mona passages', the Carrlbean
sea and the routes to American At
lantic coast cities. Denmark's hug
expenses since the beginning of the
war are said to be responsible for her
willingness to sell the islands.

KANSAS SETS AN
EXAMPLE FOR HER
CITIZENS IN TAXES
Out of 105 Counties, 79 Ht
Paid 1911 in Full.
State's Delinquency Is Smallest
In Its History.
SHAWNEE PAID HERS IN FULL
This County Has Jfo Claims
Against It for Year.
Kansas Record Best in Its
History. ,
Kansas wrote another prosperity
testimonial today when she broke the
record in the payment of taxes. A re
port by W. E. Davis, state auditor,
showed that seventy-nine of the 105
counties of the state had paid their .
1914 taxes in full. The state's de
linquency was J9.540.S9, the smallest
in the history of the state department.
The report today covers the 1814.
tax collections and is based on reports
from county treasurers for collections
to November 1, 1915. At present the
state is collecting the 1915 tax and the
record for last year's tax will not be
completed until next fall. Final re
ports on the showing will not be made
for a year.
Usually Up to (30,000.
Usually the delinquent state tax
reaches $30,000. Sometimes it goes
as high as $35,000 or $40,000. Occa
sionally it reaches a low mark of $20.
000. Then state officials are happy.
But the delinquencies for the 1914
levy were below the $10,000 mark and
all former records for collections of
state taxes were broken.
Shawnee county was among seventy
nine counties which paid her state
taxes in full. No claims were held
against this county for the 1914 tax
and Shawnee county was today given
a clean bill of health.
Cherokee county's delinquent state
tax was the highest. The Cherokee
county treasurer reported a shortage
of $2,196.22 in state taxes for 1914.
Washington county was next with a
deficit of $1,142.38. Sumner county
missed the dean record column by
just $25.31.
"The record is the best In the his
tory of the state." saw -Auattor Davis.
"Usually we expect a $20,000 to $35,
000 delinquency report. But. lhe re
port for 1914 shows the people are in
prosperous condition and are paying
their taxes promptlv."
