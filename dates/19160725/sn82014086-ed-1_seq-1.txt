Washington, July 24. The full re
port of Major General Tasker H.
Bliss, assistant chief of staff, on his

in an inspection of all camps and more
than 20,000 men reports of inefficiency
and bad rations were found to be

the rations were better than the food
tney were accustomed to having at

formation said, have a rendezvous on
"the island", a bit of Mexican terri

band.
Both General Bell and General Gon
zales tonight continued their investiga
tion of last night's exchange of shots
between outposts of the Ninth Massa
chusetts Infantry and reports that the
Americans had crossed into Mexican

the militiamen, who, they said, crossed
into Mexican territory yesterday
morning in violation of Mexican rights
and last night shot up without provo
cation a number of homes o nthe Mex
ican side of the border.
General Bell said, however, that Mr.
Garcia had communicated with him by
telephone and that he did not regard
the conversation in the nature of a
protest, but rather a notification that
the Mexican authorities were willing
to co-operate In every way to eliminate
possible chances of friction between the
two commanders.
General Bell added that Brigadier
General Leroy Sweetser, commanding
teh Massachusetts troops, reported that
the Mexicans fired first

Herrera, Count of Fernandina, a
grandee of Spain, and the last sur
vivor of the Cuban titled aristocracy
of Colonial 'days, is dead here at the
age of 89 years. The funeral was at

cials of the government and represen
tatives of Havana society.
As a grandee of Spain, the count

While his sympathies had been with
the Cubans he never took part in the
hostilities with the mother country.
Two daughters and one son, to whom
the title now descends, survive.

British Blacklist
of Americans
DIPLOMATIC EXCHANGES ARE IN
AN INQUIRY STAGE
THE POINTS IN DISPUTE
Neither Side Has Had a Chance Fully
to State Its Position British Am
bassador at Washington Has Cabled
for Information.
London, July 24, S.10 p. m. Diplo
matic exchanges between Washington
and London with regard to the statu
tory blacklist have not yet passed the
stage of inquiry. As the result of his
taik with Frank L. Polk, acting sec
retary of state. Sir Cecil Spring-Rice,
the British ambassador at Washing
ton, has cabled to the foreign office
asking for an elucidation of several
points in the blacklist not understood
by the state department.
Page to Confer With Marquis of Crewe
Walter Hincs Page, the American
ambassador in London, who already
has visited the British foreign office
on the subject of the blacklist, will
confer tomorrow with the Marquis of
Crewe, the favorite leader in the house
of lords, and Lord Robert Cecil, min
ister of war trade. At the foreign of
fice it was stated today that it was
quite incorrect to say a grave situa
tion had arisen.
No Protest Has Been Made.
Nothing in the nature of a protest
has yet been received and neither side
has had a chance to fully state its
position. It is felt, however, that the
foreign office will rely on the doctrine
that a nation has the undisputed right
to legislate as regards its own na
tionals. Officials at the foreign office
state they do not believe the British
government will rely greatly on prece
dents established in the American
Civil war and the Spanish-American
war.
GREAT BRITAIN'S
COMMERCIAL
BLACKLIST
Will Call Forth Vigorous Action by
Washington Authorities.
Washington. July 24. Administra
tion officials gave further evidence to
day that they were preparing to take
vigorous action to prevent injury to
American firms through Great Brit
ain's promulgation of a commercial
blacklist under the Trading With tb"
Enemy Act. President Wilson told
callers he was much concerned over
the probabilities of the British order,
and there were indications at the state
department that some step might be
taken soon unless a reply was forth
coming to the informal inquiries on
the subject made by Ambassador Page
at London.
Already the department has ac
cumulated considerable information
regarding the blacklist, sufficient, it
was said by one official tonight, to
warrant action if there was no prom
ise of an immediate explanation. It
was intimated that some announce
ment might be made tomorrow. In
formation reaching the department in"
dicates that the allied nations are
planning for united action along the
lines of the Trading With the Enemy
Act. Officials realize that such a de
velopment might greatly aggravate the
di culties confronting firms placed on
the blacklist and complicate diplomat!5
negotiations on the subject.
The. principle of a boycott of firms
incorporated under American law to
engage in legitimate is particularly
obnoxious to officials here. Informa
tion is desired as to just how far the
British Trading With the Enemy Act
will go beyond the primary effect up
on the British merchant. If it is to
affect any American individual, firm
or corporation doing business with a
neutral country it is believed certain
insistent representations will result.
The length to which the federal gov
ernment wnt during the Civil war in
prohibiting American citizens from
trading with the Confederate states
may be taken as a measure by the de
partment in arriving at a conclusion
as to how far it is willing to admit
legality of the act.
FLEET OF WARSHIPS
PATROLLING THE CAPES.
Said to Be Hidden in Unfrequented
Waters of Southern Drill Grounds.
Norfolk, Va.. July 24. Although the
rumor that a fleet lay behind the war
ships patrolling the capes lacked veri
fication from any official source, many
shipping men here believed it was true.
They advanced the theory that a con
siderable force of war vessels might
remain virtually hidden in the unfre
quented waters of the southern drill
grounds, forming a second line for in
terception of the Deutschland should
she pass the patrol ships safely and
then, thinking herself safe, rise to the
surface.
As the report of the presence of a
considerable allied force outside the
capes gained ground, the belief that
the Bremen might have been captured
or destroyed was more widely accept
ed. There was no tangible evidence,
however, to support it.
WARSHIP PATROLLING
OUTSIDE BOSTON HARBOR
Believed to Be Allied Cruiser on Watch
for German Submarine.
Boston, July 24. A strange warship
was reported In Massachusetts bay to
day find tonight, apparently patrolling
the harbor approaches outside the
three mile limit. On account of foggy
conditions hsr nationality could not be
made out, but Ehe was believed to be
a French or British cruiser on the
watch for the German submarine
Bremen, whloh is supposed to be near
lug the Atlantic coast.
A newspaper tug that went down the
harbor to observe the movements of
the stranger reported shortly before
midnight that she was still running up
and down the coast from Minot's light
to Cape Ann.

Home Rule for
Ireland Deferred
CABINET HAS BEEN UNABLE TO
REACH A DECISION
NEGOTIATION A FAILURE
Stumbling Block Appears to Have
Been Retention in Imperial Parlia
ment of Undiminished Nationalist
Representation.
London, July 24, 5.20 p. m. Con
firming publicly today the suspicion
that the cabinet had been unable to
reach a decision in regard to the home
rule amending bill. Premier Asquith in
the house of commons announced that
the government would not Introduce
any bill of this kind with regard to
which there was not substantial agree
ment among all parties.
David Lloyd George Fails.
This was taken in the lobbies of par
liament to mean that home rule had
been dropped for the moment and that
David Lloyd George's negotiations had
come to naught.
The stumbling clock appears to have
been the retention in the imperial par
liament of nationalist representation
in undiminished numbers.
Lively Debate Anticipated.
John Redmond, leader of the na
tionalists, moved an adjournment of
the house to discuss the premier's
responsibility and a lively debate when
the regular business of the house of
commons was concluded was antici
pated. Growing Feeling of Unrest.
The discussion of Mr. Redmond's
motion to adjourn the house of com
mons in order to call attention to the
rapidly growing feeling of unrest in
Ireland and the deplorable effect on the
Irish situation which must result from
the government not proposing to car
ry out in entirety the terms offered by
it for a settlement of the Idish diffi
culty as accepted by the Irish parties
began with a speech by Mr. Redmond.
Statement by Mr. Redmond.
The Irish nationalist leader declared
he did not want to attack anybody,
but merely to state the facts, which,
he said, spoke for themselves. He
said that when two months ago Pre
mier Asquith had returned from Ire
land and announced that the present
system of government had broken
down and said the cabinet had unani
mously requested Mr. Lloyd-George to
bring about, if possible, a provisional
settlement of the Irish question by the
consent of every one concerned, he was
thriiled by the hope that in the in
terest not only of Ireland but of the
empire the Irish question might be put
out of the way until the war had
ended.
The proposals Mr. Lloyd George put
be-fore Sir Edward Carson and him
self, Mr. Redmond said, were in no
ser.se their proposals, but after con
siderable negotiations and many
changes they agreed to recommend
them to their friends. 'Mr. Redmond
declared he had had the greatest dif
ficulty in obtaining the consent of his
supporters, not one of whom would
have considered the proposals unless
they were put forward as a purely
temporary settlement for the period of
the war.
MOTION BY JOHN
REDMOND VOTED DOWN
Premier Asquith Denies That
Partiality Was Shown.
Any
London, July 24, 11.42 p. m. A sig
nificant remark was made in the house
of commons this evening by Premier
Asquith at the conclusion of a debate
on a motion for adjournmnet made by
John Redmond, the Nationalist lead
er, following an announcement by the
premier that the government had no
intention of introducing any home rule
for Ireland bill with regard to which
there was no substantial agreement
among all parties. In appealing to
the Nationalists not to throw away
the opportunity for bringing home
rule into immediate operatian, Mr. As
quith said:
"I ask the house and will ask the
country if necessary, if the govern
ment's proposals are not fair."
Just before the motion of Mr. Red
mond was voted down, Mr. Asquith
directly addressed the Nationalists,
denying that any partiality had been
shown to either side during the nego
tiations. Mr. Asquith declared that
the exclusion of the six Ulster coun
ties from the operation of the home
rule act was to his mind the greatest
give and take arrangement ever made
in the history of a political contro
versy and he asked the nationalists
not to break off the negotiations.

TREASURY'S CONSCIENCE FUND
Returns Much Larger the Past Year
Than Ever Before.
Washington, July 24. 'Contributions
to the treasury's conscience fund for
the fiscal year ending June 30
amounted to $54,923.15, making a total
of $498,763.54 returned by persons
whose consciences were uneasy over
frauds against the government.
Figures compiled at the treasury de
partment today show the returns were
much larger during the past year than
ever before, chiefly because of two un
usual contributions, one for $30,000 and
one for $10,000.
It was in 1S11 when the first $5 came
with a letter saying the writer had
taken that amount from the govern
ment. The money was turned into the
treasury and although actually there
never has been a separate conscience
fund, records of all such contributions
have been kept. It is an unwritten
law of the department that no effort
shall be made to learn the identity of
conscience-stricken contributors and
even in cases where the writer has
confessed to theft from the govern
ment tho money has been accepted and
no effort made to prosecute.

to do al in his power to save Case
ment, saying they do not consider him
a traitor to the British cause, but in
spired in his actions by Irish patriot
ism. The pontiff, in addition to the in
fluence he is exercising in Liondon, has
interested Sir Henry Howard, the
British minister to the Vatican, in the
case.
The pope already has obtained from
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria
grace for Cra.uak, a leader of the Bo
hieimian patriots, Hvho was made a
prisoner while fighting against Aus
tria and condemned to be hanged.

the proper time, the strikers assert,)
will result in the cancellation of thou-,
sands of policies. The company, an-l
ticipa'Ung tho strike, has announced;
that arrangements are being made to
protect policyholders and to have the
strikers replaced by experienced men.
The company announced that none of
the men who walked out would be re
instated under any circumstances.
The Original Grievance.
The strike followed the company'3
dismissal of 30 or 40 employes who had
formed a protective association and
the refusal of the company today to
receive its representatives. The orig
inal grievance, it was stated, was a
recent rule laid down by the com-,
pany which provides that no matter
what the circumstances may be, when
premiums on policies are four weeks
in arrears the policy must be can
celled. This rule, if enforced, agents
declare, would result in a wholesale
lapse of policies and a reduction of
their income.
