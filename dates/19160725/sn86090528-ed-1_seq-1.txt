ROCK ISLAND MAY USE TEN
MILLION GALS. CITY WATER
That the Rock Island company is
considering the proposition to do away
with their water plant In' Chickasha
and use the city water exclusively be
came known yesterday afternoon dur
ing the visit in this city of a number
of high officials of that road.
For two weeks the question has oc
cupied the attention of Superintendent
Frank Serimager of the water works
system, . the city fathers and Mayor
Coffman but no definite proposal was
submitted by the city until last Satur
day when Superintendent Scrimager
made the railroad company an offer on
the basis of a ten million gallon con
sumption per month, offering a grad
uating scale of 8, 7 and 6 cents per
1,000 gallons.
H is estimated that this will yield
to the city an additional revenue of
about $3,000 per year beyond the
amount that is now being paid by the
company to the city, without entailing
any additional expense to the city be
yond the employment of an additional
engineer at the plant, which would
run between sixteen and eighteen
hours a day instead of eight or nine

its simplicity and the promise of dura

In order to demonstrate the method
Mr. Merlllat came ' personally from
Iowa to the state of Oklahoma, not be
ing satisfied with the mere shipment
of the order, and will prove to the
county commissioners that the forms
are all that they are represented to be
and that they will serve to reduce
maintenance cost to a point where
they become practically nil for many
years, before ho asks the county to
pay for them. Therefore the county
cannot lose. , .
These forms are made in two varie
ties, the bridge and culvert, bottj ad
justable. The Merlllat adjustable bridge iorta
is an arch adjustable to any size from
six to twenty-two feet and a culvert or
bridge of any intervening size can ba
built over it. It is durably and sub
stantially built and all parts that come
in contact with the concrete are heav
ily ga'vanized. It consists of a series
ot adjustable arches built of Bluel an
gles and malleable iron and a cover
of heavy steel sheets reinforced with
angle irons. It is readily collapsed
and while It Is strong and heivy as a
whole, -no single part is too heavy to
be easily handled. It can be set up in
a few hours and taken dow'n in 4 few
minutes, while the ordinary systems
require days for either operation. Its
adjustability to different Biases, it8

and rapidity with which it can be set
