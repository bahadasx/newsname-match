In tho United-States of the publica

American firms.
Some firms In this city, which have
beon doing their American business
through f'rms on the prohibited list
and now are compelled to make other
arrangements, have already received
hints that they may have some tron-'
bio In obtaining substitutes, as their
former correspondents are said to
have threatened to boycott any other
American firm taking over the busi

ports prat-ailing in tho' city, certain
neutral traders formed an interna

various- economic measures f the
belligerents likely to affect their trad

POLICE INVESTIGATING
THE
Death List Remains at Six, With
Two Score injured.
San Francisco, Jujy 21. A day
spent In shadowing anarchist head
quarters and investigating rumors has
brought to the police no tangible trace
of the culprit who vented nis feeling
against national defense by timing a
suit case bomb and leaving it on a
crowded downtown corner to explode
and kill six and wound more than two
score spectators and participants in
San Francisco's preparedness parade.
The death list remains at six, al
though Thomas H. Turnbull, former
manager of the Family club of this,
city, who suffered a fractured skull,
lies at the Central Emergency hos
pltal with little chance for recovery.
Of the score or more who were tak
en to the hospital, all but Turnbull
had been removed to their homes or
other hospitals.
An advertisement offering f 1,000,
which will "be paid any way you want
it for the tip that will secure tho ar
rest and conviction of tho parties re
sponsible for the bomb," was inserted
in local papers by Ben F. Lamborne
of Alameda, brother of L. H.( Lam
borne, one of the dead. '
Souvenir hunters picked up, blocks
from the scene of the explosion, addi
tional bits of marble, stone, glass and
pipe which, with nails, formed the
contents of the deadly suit case. Scars
were found on buildings, some two
blocks away, which were made by
flying missiles.
Both the Grand Army of the Repub
lic and the First California Voluni
teers, which were lining up on Stew
art street, a few feet from the bomb,
suffered in loss of members by th
explosion. Dr. George L. Painter, one
of the California volunteers, and
Adam Fox, a seventy-year-old civil
war veteran, died of their injuries.
the Woman's Auxiliary, were other
participants.
Today's sessions were devoted to
a series of conferences and discus
sions and ritualistic work. This even
ing the annual encampment banquet
will be held. Tho banquet will be fol
lowed by tho annual military ball.
Deutschland Still at Baltimore.
Baltimore, July 24. Tho only thing

merchantman Deutschland is that she
is alongside a pier In the Patapsco
river, whero she was berthed fourteen
days ago, when sho completed her
voyage from Germany. It was offi
cially stated that clearance papers as

British held the line from Thlepval
southward to Longueval, shown In the
upper portion of the accompanying

line northeast of Hardecourt, about the
center of the map. The double line Is

Immediate objective Is Peronne, both

The French now command the railroad

Von HIndenburg's Line Reported Cut
at Several Points by Kuropatkln's
Men, Who Have Penetrated a Dis
tance of Five Miles Aiistrlans
Withdrawing Toward the Main
Ridge of the Carpathians.
London, July 24. In tho Somme
sector the British launched a new at
tack on tho whole line from Pozieres
to Guillemont, and the fact that Gen
eral Haig has been able to resume the
offensive so soon after tho unsuccess
ful German counter attacks of lat
week, In which very strong German
forces wero brought forward. Is re
garded as a good augury.
The fighting has been of the fiercest
character, the Germans working with
their utmost strength to prevent the
British from advancing to their third
line positions. But when the last re
ports left headquarters in France the
Australians had firmly established
themselves astride the road In the di
rection of Bapaume, while at Guille
mont and Longeuval fortunes fluctu
ated, both places changing hands sev
eral times.
Berlin Is at variance with the Brit
ish communication, declaring that
along the entire line the attacks of
the British wero fruitless and that
they suffered heavy casualties. Around
Pozieres and tho Foureauy wood the
combatants came to grips in hand-to-hand
fighting.
The German counter attacks re
cently delivered against the French
front have proved equally unsuccess
ful, and the entente allies now are
fighting slowly in the direction of
Combles, which is only two miles dis
tant from Guillemont
According to reliable estimates, the
British and French together have cap
tured since July 1 more than 26,000
prisoners, 140 guns and hundreds of
machine guns.
From the eastern frontier come fur
ther reports of continued Russian suc
cesses. General Kuropatkln has cut
Field Marshal Von HIndenburg's line
at several points and, according to an
unofficial report, has penetrated a dis
tance of five miles.
At the other extremity of the long
line the Austrians officially admit
their withdrawal toward the main
ridge of the Carpathians and the Rus
sians are within four miles of the
Hungarian frontier, moving toward
Maramaro3 Sziget.
There Is no further official news of
General Sakharoff's operations, but,
according to unofficial accounts, he Is
on the point of entering northeaRt
Gallcla. General Boerm-Ermolli and
General Bothmer being outflanked both
north and south. General Sakharoff's
forces are supposed to be working In
the direction of Brody and Sokal.

NO ORDERS TO MOVE RECEIVER
Brigade Review Called Off by General
. Speaks Because of the Heat Sev
eral Regiments Paraded Before the
Governor Payday to Break Monot
ony of Camp Life Cotton Uniform
Needed by Guardsmen.
Columbus, July 24. The Eighth reg
iment received a shipment of 1,200
overcoats from the federal govern
ment for possible service on the bor
der, but no orders to move were re
ceived. Because of the heat, the brigade re
view was called off by orders of Gen
eral Speaks. Governor Willis visited
the camo and first the Fourth regi
ment under Colonel B. I Eargar, and;
later the Fifth regiment, under Col
onel Char'os X. Zimmerman, were pa
raded. They were the first parades,
that have been held at the camp since
It was opened.
To break the routine of camp life,
two episodes loom on the immediate
horizon. The first is the paying of
the men, which Colonel Duffy said
would start tomorrow, barring un
looked for difficulties, and the second
is the beginning of the third and last
ro4ind of prophylactic treatment for
typhoid fever.. Colonel Joseph Hall
received the necessary shipment of:
serum. The third Injection, he said,
Is not so important as the first two,
as it can be administered any timo
within several weeks after the second
shot, and two shots in themselves in
sure reasonable Immunity, It was said-
The health of the camp Is excep
tionally good, according to Colonel
Hall, with less than one-half of 1 per
cent reported for sick call. This ia
low for any community.
The weather brought up again tho
question of supplies, particularly the
cotton uniform. It develops that the t
war In Europe is largely to blame for
the American soldiers wearing- a.
woolen outfit at a time when Palm
Beach outfits are in vogue. It seems
that the olive drab cotton uniforms
which th government supplies look
all right at the start, but that they
do not wash well. They all fade, It
Is said, but they do not fade alike, so
that, in a literal sense, they cease to
be a uniform after they have been
washed two or three times.
TO THE POINT
Bertha Green, colored, was killed at
Columbus by an unknown negro.
