VENIZELOS SEES
ALLIED VICTORY
Athens, July 24.—Former Premier
Venizelos openly challenges King
Constantlne's expressed belief that
Germany cannot be defeated in an
article in yesterday's Herald.
Venizelos quotes an interview given
by the king to an ^Associated Press
representative last January, in which
the monarch declared that the war
would Tesult in a draw.
"Who Is now so blinded by pre
judices," asks the statesman, "that Jie
still believes in German victory? Who
today, after the re-organization of the
Russian army and the organization of
Kitchener's army, by which England
is raised to the rank of a great mili
tary power, still imagines that the war
can be ended by a bastard peace in
which there will be neither victor nor
vanquished
In the Interview referred to, King
Constantine said:
"If economic exhaustion does not
force Germany to sue for peace, I be
lieve It will be very difficult, if not
Impossible, to conquer her in a military
way."
Asked as to what he believed would
be the outcome of the war, the king
replied:
"A draw—don't you?"
The Interview was given on January
20.
Baltimore, Md., July 24.—Asked to
day when the German merchant sub
marine Deutschland would sail on her
return voyage to Germany, Paul G. L.
Hilken, member of the Eastern For
warding Co., the boat's American agen
cy, said she would start "just as soon
as we can get her ready and that will
not be much longer." Hitherto ques
tions of persons connected with the
Deutschland about her sailing plans
have been met with evasive replies or
pointblank refusals to discuss them.
From a reliable source it was learn
ed today that the Eastern Forwarding
Co. has closed Its negotiations for a
large consignment of gold to be taken
back on the submersible. It was said
the gold will be put aboard today and
that the boat will then be ready to
leave.
Nothing could be learned as to the
amount or from whom it was obtained
except that it was through negotia
tions with "one of the largest Ameri
can banking institutions."

Action of Dictator
Brownsville, Tex., Jtity Mr
There was a clash early today be
tween Illinois troopers and Mexi
cans on the banks of the Rio
Grande. A vigorous exchange of
shots followed the frustrating of
an apparent attempt of some Mex
icans to tamper with the water
supply at Bhmnsvllle. One bullet
passed throuah the hat of Harry
Warren of A troop, first Illinois
cavalry, which is on duty at the
pumping station. Other bullets
cut away branches around Capt.
Joseph Mattes' patrols. None of
the soldiers were hit. All of the
fighting took plaoe on the Ameri
can side.
New York, July 24—Radical changes
In laws governing foreigners doing
business in Mexico are about to be
made by Gen. Carranza in a series of
decrees which later will be included In
a new constitution, according to recent
arrivals from Mexico City.
The new regulations, it is said, will
provide that all foreign investors, be
fore entering business in Mexico, must
agree not to have recourse in any case
to any other law than that of Mexico
and that they will not be entitled to
any privileges not enjoyed by Mexi
cans. It will also provide that foreign
capital already investodwta »Mexl
enjoy the right to be considered for
eign and be entitled to the protection
of Its own government until the expira
tion of the concession or agreement
that it may have entered into provided
it is not for a very long period.
Another provision is designed to fix
a uniform period for all the long or un
limited contracts, leases or concessions
In which foreign capital la interested
and that at the end of this period they
will be considered subject only to the
authority of the Mexican government
and deprived of the right of appeal for
protection to their respective govern
ments.
It is the belief of First Chief Car
ranza and his advisers that these
measures will suffice to avoid the dan
ger of complications with European
powers and as a natural sequel will lift
from the United States the responsibil
ity of defending the territorial integ
rity of Mexico against the possibility
of seizure of lands or properties by any
foreign nation In order to pay the
claims of their nationals.
VILLA NEAR CAPTURE.
El Paso. Tex., July 24.—Only by the
merest chance did Francisco Villa
escape capture when his column was

according to a private letter received
here today from an American in the
town.
"Villa personally directed the band
that attacked the city," the letter said.
"He directed the operations from a
carriage about a mile behind the lines.
In this carriage were two women and
a man. When the bandits were push
ed back by the government troops they
fled past the carriage, stopping only
to provide the cheftain with a horse
on which he made his escape. The
women fled into the brush and also
escaped.
"A moment or so after the carriage
was seized by Carranzista soldiers and
the man, who proved to be a Swiss
nurse, was captured. In the carriage
were Villa's crutches and several rolls
of handages. The nurse said that
Villa's wounds necessitated an Im
mediate operation and complete rest
for some weeks."

one-half at this time is to permit traf
fic to continue uninterrupted and all
car drivers as well as others using the
road are asked to keep to one side,
that which is untreated, until the oil
has soaked into the oiled road* and
from the underground crossing to take
the old road south of the tracks in to

point midway between Agency and Ot
tumwa where the Agency people who
are oiling the balance of the road will
continue the work. Persons who live
along this road are requested to take
the sides of the highway as near the
gutters as possible In order to give
the oil a chance to get In Its effective
ness without being hampered by traf
fic. The road will be closed to others
than those who have to use it as the
only means of travel to and from their
homes.

be interrupted but a few days and car
owners or others using the roads are
asked to aid in the work of improve
ment by avoiding the oiled roads until

WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO
TAKE DRASTIC ACTION.
New York, July 24.—Merchants
whose foreign trade has been handi
capped by Great Britain through the
circulation of blacklists, said today
that they were collecting a mass of
material to lay before the state de
partment to emphasize a formal pro
test and that their communication to
the federal government probably
would be ready late this week,.
By a comparison of experiences,
made now for the first time, local ex
porters say they are able to define the
methods by which the British govern
ment seeks to prevent citizens of the
Teutonic empires from benefiting in
any way from neutral trade. In their
protest they will describe how, In order
to do any export business with Great
Britain or her colonies or allies, It
was necessary to obtain from the for
eign trade department of the British
embassy at Washington a "letter of
assurance," which states "as far as Is
at present known there would appear
to be no objection on the part of the
British government' to this consign
ment." One exporter said that before
he could obtain such a trade passport
he wrote twenty letters and sent num
erous telegrams to the British em
bassy.

where in the rear of Peronne on the
Somme front, says a dispatch to the
wireless press from Berne, made a
speech to the German wounded sol
diers which is attracting great atten
tion in Germany. The German emper
or is quoted as saying:
"It is the most poignant grief of my
life that I am unable to take a more
active part In this war. It is my ear
nest desire to take my place in the
trenches and to deal such blows at our
enemies as my age and strength would
permit.
"I could take my place with the
youngest of you and I promise that I
would leave my mark on the enemy
But the inscrutable Almighty has will
ed otherwise. Into my care has been
committed by }ivine destiny the lead
ership of our country, its armies and
its forces on land and sea.
"The burden of thinking, deciding
and leading has been hard upon me
and realizing this I know that my life
must not be risked in the foremost
line of battle where my feelings, if un
restrained, would carry me swiftly.
"My life must be conserved for the
welfare of Germany in order to carry
out the duties assigned to me by divine
appointment."
GERMHESSELS
BE SEIZED
Rio Janeiro, July 24.—The question
of requisitioning German ships in
Brazilian ports wil shortly be taken
up by the Brazilian congress. Deputy
Gohcalves Naia is preparing' a resolu
tion authorizing such a requisition,
which he will present to the chamber.
There are thirty-eight German ships
and four Austrian In Brazilian ports.
This shipping is estimated to be worth
between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000.
The biggest ship of the fleet is the
Hamburg-American liner Bluecher,
which has a net tonnage of 7,592.
There has been, some ill will against
Germany in Brazil because Germany
seized Brazilian coffee worth $7,000,
000 and refused payment for It. After
Portugal had requisitioned German
ships In her ports last ,February It
was reported in New Yorok and Lon
don that Brazil had taken similar ac
tion. Germany's declaration of war on
Portugal was greeted by popular dem
onstrations in Rio Janeiro in favor of
