lit
Cleveland, July
The death of the rescuers In the
first and second instances was due to
the fact that they worked without
oxygen helmets, which were unavail
able.
Of those rescued who died later no
pulmotora were at hand to attempt
to resuscitate them. ThU lack of
rescue apparatus was condemned by
(he rescuers and iMayor Davlir- today
-.promised- to conduct a. rigid lnvestt
itfp this shortcoming as well
0 the ttegedy Itself.
It? third rescue party was equipped
with helmets, but nearly eleven houn)
had elapsed following the explosion
before sufficient equipment to lit out
the party was at hand to permit a de
scent into the tunnel.
•$?? Cause of Explosion Unknown.
The cause of the explosion has not
been ascertained. It is supposed
some workmen struck a pocket of gas
with a pick or possibly gas collected
In the tunnel and became Ignited by
., an electric spark.
The tunnel was equipped with elec
trically driven machinery for exca
vating.
The party of workmen caught by
the explosion entered the tunnel at 8
last night. First intimation of the
disaster came when W. H. Nolan, lock
tender in the air chamber at the en
trance to the tunnel, heard the dull
boom of an explosion. This was about
9:30 p. m. Dolan was thrown against
a door. This door, was Jammed by the
blast and deadly fumes poured out of
the tunnel. Dolan managed to close
the door and then releasing the high
pressure from the air chamber, he
opened the door leading to the crib
above and gave the alarm.
Rescuers Overcome,
frf Superintendent John Johnson sum
moned volunteers and led the first res
cue party aown the elevator and into
the tunnel. One hundred fifty fe»t
from the bottom of the shaft they be
gan to stumble end fall, overcome by
fumes. Dolan rushed after them. Ho
saw a flash of light In the darkness. It
proved to be Johnson's flashlight,
which he still grasped where he had
fallen. Dolan dragged him to the bot
tom of the elevator shaft and went
back. Almost dead himself he dragged
Peter McKenna to safety.
Others from the crib took the three
on the elevator and they were placed
on boats attracted from shore by
rockets.
It was two houraK later that Van
Duzen, who had been summoned from
his home by telegraph, organized the
second rescue party on shore and went
to the crib.
Meet Same Fate.
With his men he entered the tunnel.
His men found Michael Keough, of the
first rescue party,, still alive, and
dragged him out. They went in again,
only to suffer the same fate which had
befallen the first party. Finally four
of them managed to stagger back to
safety. The others did not come out
until the third rescue party was or
ganized.
It became known today that work in
the tunnel' had been suspended three
••days ago because gas was found. The
men sent in last night went to worio
believing the gas had been eliminated.
."We should never have gone into the?
tunnel last night," said Dolan today.
'We never got a report whether the
place was safe but they said it was all
fight for us to go.'
Mayor Starts Investigation.
Mayor Davis issued a statement
saying an. investigation Into the entire
disaster would start Wednesday to fix
any responsibility for the tragedy and
lack of rescue apparatus.
The tunnel was begun under the
previous administration, headed by
Newton D. Baker, now secretary of
war, and supervision had been in
charge of officers selected by that ad
-inlnistration.

bedding as it was removed from the
Interned North German Lloyd steamer
Neckar nearby. Since the sub
marine's arrival two weeks ago the
Deutschland's orew has been sleeping
