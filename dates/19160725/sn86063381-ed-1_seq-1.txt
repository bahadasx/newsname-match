FINDING FAULT WITH MILITIA
Regular Army Men in Favor of Gen

By William G. Shepherd
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
San Antonio, Tex July 25 A
welt defined scheme exists in the Unit
ed States to prove the militia scheme
a failure.
Americans may expect shortly a
subtle newspaper campaign against
the militia system. Defects in the
militia will be pointed out and every
little hitch will be magnified. The
American mind will be slowly poison
ed, if possible, against the entire fed
eralized militia plan. Action of the
Merchants' association in New York
to recall the New York militia on the
basis that mobilization of the national
guard as part of the regular army
has been a failure, has been received
in certain circles here with utmost
approval.
Big Army Finds Faults.
All supporters of a huge federal
army find hundreds of faults with
the militia encamped here. Before
the militia was called out these fed
eral army supporters were able to de
liver only theories in support of their
arguments, but now that the militia
lies stretched out along the border
for them to examine they discover
many facts and incidents which are
being used in certain portions of the
press, perhaps unwittingly in an ef
fort to persuade Americans to the
belief that the militia is an absolute
failure
While I find the personnel of our
regular army equal to anything In
Europe and ready for any trouble,
