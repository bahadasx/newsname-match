FEDERAL AID FOR GOOD ROADS
Mark Sullivan, of Collier's, says: •'Obviously, the appropria

are made, the next step would be, not to abandon a foolish method
of national subsidy, but to demand enough more to make the work
practical. That would quickly run Into hundreds of millions of dol
lars yearly. Then we shall have a federal pork barrel that will
serve eoiiKrcssmen as well an special pension bills and other decay
