Daniels Seeks Amendment of
Senate Aotlon Which Puts
Building In Washington.
BALTIMORE 15 AFTER PLANT
Secretary Believes Location a
Matter of Administration
Polloy.'
Secretary of the Navy Daniels
ha taken steps to. induce the Sen
ate to strike from the naval bill
the paragraph designating Wash
ington as the site for the $2,000,
000 'naval research laboratory.
Mr. Daniels so advised a dele
gation from Baltimore that came
to Washington today to urge the
claims of Baltimore as the site for
the proposed plant.
The committee was told to pre
pare a brief setting forth Balti
more's claims, for submission to
the naval consulting board.
It is Secretary Daniels' desire
that the designation of Washings
ton be stricken from the bill and
the contest left -open so that the
wishes of the consulting board
shall "rule in the selection of the
laboratory site.

Wants Competition.
Secretary Daniels did not Indicate that
be intended to go any further than he
has gone to have the name of Washing
ton stricken out of the bill, Ha said,
however, he believed the matter should
be thrown open to competition and left
for the consulting board to decide.
Chairman Edison, of the consulting
board. Is believed to favor Fhlladel-
Jhla as a site for the laboratory. If
hrown open to competition there are
evidences that a fight for the laboratory
will ensue that may delay passage of
the naval bill.

BALTIMORE, July 85. Tha stay or

freighter Peutiohland may ba deter

here between her promoters and Oer

Despite the mass of misinforma

Bremen is reported safe in the mean
time, the subject of the sssslon. it Is
assumed, will be on the matter of
either Indefinitely interning her, or
making a bold run for home- taking
chances with the allied patrol off the
canes.
If Bernstorff does advise the pro
moters.. It will be unofficially, despite
his official position.
The whereabout of the Bremen be
gins to give some uneasiness, though
he has not been out sufficiently long
to maka it at all certain thai no has
met with mishap.
But, tha Deutaohland apparently will
take no foolhardy gamble with the
capes patrol. If the Bremen has had
trouble, the Deutschland may decide
to avoid it by an Indefinite stay. "
Despite the possibility that the Bre

George E, Hamilton Declares
Commission's Figures "Fall
Short of Full Value."
Indicating that court proceeding
may follow the hearing before the
.public Utilities Commission on the
valuation of the properties of tha
Capital Traction Company, George C
Hamilton, president of tha company,
today gave out a statement In whleh
he said tha commission's figures fall
hort of showing the full value of the
company.
Mr. Hamilton asssrta that the fig'
urea of the commlsslon'are "so mueh
lower than tire -actual value known
to us" that ha I at a loss to express
an opinion of the work done by the
commission, He says the company's
flgures were obtained by a recent
careful examination "made by experts
of the highest standing."
Hamilton's Statement.
Tha atatement of Mr. Hamilton la a
follows!
"We hava read, but have not exam

tha UtllltU. Commission of the Dis

and the original cost of the company's

The gas, ignited by electrfsti
machinery, exploded with terrific
force.
Up to 11 120 a. m. ten bodies had
been recovered from the death

from die huge bore still alive.
Some of them may die. All ex

the entombed men; lack of hel
mets and pulmotors when aid did
arrive, and absence of direct com
munication with the shore Ave
miles distant from the scene of the
accident were some of the reasons
giyen as responsible for tho dis
aster. Two firemen, Lavelle and Kia
termaker, with gas helmets, were
able to penetrate to the main tun
nel, where G. C. Van Dusen was
found exhausted.
IN GAS FILLED TRAP.
The ten known dead were member
of three rescue parties who descended
Into the death trap, although they had
no helmets.
The body of Clarence Welch wtvu
taken out .nt the same time. The flro

The chamber where the men are trap

Eleven of the twenty-three men trap

working toward shore In the tunnel.
The rest wore members of the rotoue
parties which went down the crib shaft
and Into tho tunnel In a desperate ef
fort -to drag their comrades 'back to
tafety,
Failure to make proper tests of gas
strength and lack of sufficient air pres
sure In the tunnel were pointed out a
contributing causes of tha disaster.
It was seven hours after the acci
dent before pulmatora and helmeta
were secured. It was two hours bo
fore help arrived. Three men taken
from the tunnel died before pulmotors
were available.
A triple probe by city, county and
State officials will be' held to fix the
cause and responsibility for the dis
aster. Officials will meat Monday with
Mayor Davis to set the time for tho
inquest arid Inquiry.
Had No Helmets.
Capt. Hans Hansen, ot the United
State Life Saving Station, was tho
first on the scene, but he had no hel
meta or pulrootorai so went back for
thorn. Two small boata from the ore
freighter, Star of Jupiter, next arrived,
but they had no apparatus with which
to cope with-the deadly fumes.

Two Rescuers Saved.
Two of the rescuer who com out
were Patrtok Keogh and Martin Nel

"Every man still in that tunnel U

If the twenty-threq men aro dead.
the tragedy, the greatest In the history
of Cleveland water werks development,
will be laid partly at the door of un-

There wore no gas helmots, no pul

crib had no communication whatever
with the shore.
Fifteen workmen wero overcome at
6:30 o'clock last night when go burst

but wore themselves caught behind
heavy steel doors, which were automa

Roman candles and sky-rockets were
hot Into the air by crib workmen. It
was two hours before help came and
then helmet wcro lacking, so no prog

which put out from Cleveland at flmt

The gas pocket, which had all tho
power of the big guthern in commercial
