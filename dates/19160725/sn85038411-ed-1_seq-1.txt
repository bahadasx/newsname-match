By Associated Press
Cleveland, July 25. Twenty-two i
men are dead and half a dozen others j
dying as the result of an explosion of j
gas in a water works tunnel five miles ,
from shore under Lake Erie late last
night.
The dead Include workmen who
were trapped in the tunnel when pas
exploded and members of two rescue
parties who attempted to save the
men first trapped.
Of the dead eleven were in
force trapped by the explosion. Xone
of these escaped. The first rescue ,
party consisted of seven men. Four;
of them perished and three were i
saved. The second rescue party com- j
prised eleven men. Six of these lost j
their lives and five escaped. The first
rescue party accomplished nothing.
The second saved one of the first re
lief expedition. No one has yet reach
ed any of the original eleven caught
in the workings. Of the eight res- i
cuers who got out alive two died later.
The others may die. Two men were
also overcome by fumes who did not
go into the tunnel. j
A third rescue party entered the
tunnel at 8.30 and brought out alive
Gustav C. Van Duzen, superintendent
of water works construction, who ,had
headed the second relief force. van
Duzen may die from his experiences.
One body was also brought out by the
third rescue party. This was a mem
ber of the second rescue crew. It had
been supposed that Van Duzen had
perished.
Lack of Apparatus Hampers
The tragic fate of the rescuers in
the first and second instances was due
to the fact that they worked without

Rounding Up Runaway
"Lampers" in Rain Beats
Chasing Greased Pigs
When Karl Steward, secretary of
the C. Day Rudy Company, is not
establishing new records for the sale
of stained glass windows or making
after-dinner speeches before the Har
risburg Rotary Club, he loves to go
fishing. Bass p.nd salmon fairly fight
each other to «et caught when he casts
in his line, but it's different, oh, very,
verv different with lamprey eels.
Mr. Steward demonstrated this to
his own satisfaction and that of a
party of grinning friends this morning
when he stepped off a West Shore car
with an umbrella in one hand and a
bucket of fine "lampers" in the other.
A swish of the wind turned his um
brella wrong s>de out and in trying to
recover his balance Steward and the
lampreys went down together. Mr.
Steward got up in a moment. Not so
the lampreys. They reveled in their
new-found freedom.
After it was all over and the eels
were back in the can Mr. Steward con
fidentially informed a party of friends,
as he wiped his perspiring brow, that
he'd just as soon any day undertake to
capture a herd of greased pigs as to
round up a bunch of runaway
"lampers."

;
Gilday Says Both Sides Owe It
to Greatest Sufferer to Arbi
trate Dispute
MAY POSTPONE PARADE
Will Man All Cars, Musser
Says, if Men Do Not Return
as "Individuals"
The heavy rain of to-day brought
to a head the public demand for a
settlement of the street car strike.
Scores of the jitneys that have
thronged the streets did not venture
from their garages and hundreds of
working people trailed wet and un
comfortable in dripping lines along
the streets to their places of employ
ment. Discomfort and discontent
were manifested everywhere. That
there should be a ground whereon the
men and the company could meet
without loss of honor or prestige to
either appeared to be the general con
sensus of opinion.
Patrick Gilday, head of the State !
Bureau of Mediation and Arbitration, j
hit the nail on the head so far as j
public opinion is concerned, when he
said: "If no meeting between the
strikers and the company is possible,
then both sides owe it to the public, |
which is the greatest sufferer, to sub- i
mit their case to arbitration."
Mr. Gilday made his statement
when he learned that the Harrisburg
Railways company will not meet the
committee of the union to-morrow
mor.iing at 10 o'clock, but insists on
dea'ing with the men "as employes."
The strikers again declared this;
morning that they will insist on re- '
cognition of the union, and are willing
and have been since the strike started j
to submit to arbitration.
To Man All Cars
President Frank B. Musser, of the
Railways company said this morning
that the company has decided not to
recognize the union, and should the
men on strike not meet with hint to- i
morrow morning as employes, ar
rangements will be made instantly to |
man all cars on all lines of the com
pany and resume regular service to
all points.
Owing to the steady rain of to-day,
the parade this evening may be post
poned. Union men stated at noon |
that should it rain to-night the par
ade of the strikers, labor organizations
and sympathizers probably will be j
held on Thursday night. To-morrow
night a big mass meeting open to the
public will be held in the Technical
High school auditorium.
Operate 22 Cars
Twenty-two cars were operated
during the day on the city and su
burban lines of the company, with
service to all points except Oberlin
and Hummelstown. For the flrst
time since the strike became effective,
cars were operated on the Lingles
town line of the company.
President Musser announced this
morning that the new men now op
erating cars will remain here until the
situation is settled and that should
there be no meeting to-morrow morn
ing with the strikers "as employes of
the company" regular service will be

Impressive Services
Mark Riley Funeral
By Associated Press
Indianapolis, July 25. The fun
eral of .Tames Whitcomb Riley was
held at his home here to-day. The
simple services were attended by rel
atives and a few of his most intimate

vault to see the last ceremonies.
The services at the house were con
ducted by the Rev. Joseph A. Mil

E. Taylor, pastor of the First Bap
tist church, assisted.
The body was placed in the vault
pending arrangements for its final
disposition. The vault was decorated
with flowers of brilliant colors which
the poet liked best. Beautiful rugs
were spread on the floor. A short
prayer at the cemetery concluded the
services.

Illinois Troops Charged
With Rioting and Shirking
By Associated Press
San Antonio, Tex., July 25. The
rioting of certain members of the
Eighth Illinois Infantry, composed of
negroes, and the alleged shirking of
whole squads of the First Illinois Bri
gade on a practice march yesterday
were the topics of much comment to
dhy.
Negro Guardsmen said that slurs cast
on them by whites, both civilians and
military, led to the attack by Herbert
Henne. Some of them chased Henne in
to a saloon, where he defended hlmseli
until a provost guard of regulars arriv
ed and fired on the militiamen, slightly
wounding three of them. .

How to Save Your Baby
From Infantile Paralysis
PRECAUTIONS to be taken by mothers to keep their baiies from the
dread ravages of infantile paralysis are set out in a TOlletin issued
to-day by the Pure Milk Society. The bulletin is as follows:
"Of the mother of every child, her mother heart will demand:
What shall I do to save my baby?
"Watch, anxious mother, for every symptom which may prove an
index to the disease; and seek medical care without an hour's delay.
"Infantile paralysis is a germ disease. The best preventative is
cleanliness. Our duty as citizens is to do all we possibly can, indi
vidually and jointly, to stamp out the causes of any epidemic as swiftly
and effectively as it can be accomplished.
"The agency of the disease is known to lurk in the breeding places
of insects, such as flies, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, ticks, ants, body lice
and similar vermin. It is known also that many small animals are the
carriers of the poison in this, as in many other infections. Among them
are active carriers—cats, dogs and probably rats. Household' tf"6t6
should at all times be kept scrupulously clean and, during the preva
lence of any epidemic, should be withdrawn from the vicinity of
infants.
"Take precautions to avoid infection by maintaining conditions of
extra hygiene for all infants and other susceptible persons, keeping
their health at the highest pitch of excellence.
"The utmost vigilance must be exercised in feeding, in clothing,
in freedom from harmful excitements and exhaustion, in taking abun
dant rest and in protection from such common carriers as flies, mos
quitoes and small animals. During the entire epidemic young children
should be kept apart from others wherever It is possible.
"The Pure Milk Society is doing everything within its limited means
to prevent any epidemic among the babies of our city. In this work it
finds among other things a very great necessity for mosquito netting
and fly paper; donations of either of these articles will be highly ac
ceptable and much apreciated. Any donations or communications
relative thereto may be sent to the Pure Milk Station, Front and Boas
streets."
