GEI1ERAL BUTT OF IIE17
. TO THE
New York, July 25. Asserting that
the lack of equipment and training of
the National Guard regiments sent to
Mexico furnished a glaring lesson on
unpreparedness, Brigadier General
McCosky Butt, on the "reserve list of
the New York state National Guard,
declared yesterday that our military
establishment compared to those of
European countries stands in about
the same l elation tnat the old New
jToi k jjunjfeer fire department bears
to the fire Department of today.
General "Butt, who commanded a
brigade at Camp Black, L. I., when
troops were being mustered into ser
vice, for the war with Spain, stated
that there had -been no improvement
in the system since 1898. v ' ?
"Could anything be more- scandalous
than to take green men off the streets
and send them to the border, some
half equipped and some with no equip
ment?" asked General Butt. - ;
. "Was it fair or consistent to rush
men off without previous training or
hardening to a trying climate and en
deavor to harden them in the presence
of an enemy? The Mexicans may be
classed as a poor enemy, but they
have had at least three years of war.
"Imagine taking troops to the bor
der who do not know how to shoot or
keep their rifles clean, and shooting is
the first "requisite of the soldier. Just
look at the record in shooting of some
of the New , York organizations last
spring as shown by the official records.
"The Seven Infantry, with 980
men, qualified 472 marksmen, sharp
shooters and experts; and this regi
ment is recognized as the best in New
York city. The Twelfth . Infantry,
with 773 men, only qualified 57. The
Fourteenth Infantry with 654 men,
was poorer yet, qualifying only 38.
The Twenty-third Infantry, with 720
men, qualified 100. The Sixty-ninth
Infantry, with 800 men, qualified 35.
The Seventy-first Infantry, with 916
men,'qualified '129, and ' the Forty-
seventh, with 773 men, qualified 41.
"It is thus seen that out of the ,4645
men in the above named regiments,
only '400 men knew how to shoot.
When you recruit these regiments to
war strength, give them no training
in rifle practice before .being moved
to the border, what kind of a military
asset is it? If Carranjza had not
changed his policy it would have
meant leading lambs to the slaughter.
"There is little use in going into all
these discissions. The question is will
the people of the United States wake
up at the glaring lesson of unpre
paredness right before them, and have
compulsory military service, under
trained professional officers.
,"If they, do not wake up, they may
see the country, or at least its princi
pal cities, occupied by a foreign army
during the next fifteen years. If we
have universal military training no
big country in the world would trou
ble us. If the scandalous and shame
ful lessons are ignored the people of
America will pay the penalty.
"Universal training may cost money
but is a cheap insurance against be
ing plundered of a large war contri
bution and some of the states being
occupied by a foreign army." .

Enthusiastic Work of the Young Peo
ple Captured the Library for '
Their Favorite Institution
: . The library contest instituted in this
city by the Educational Contest Com
pany, of Mansfield, Ohio, closed last
Saturday night at 9 o'clock, and re
sulted in the Ocala High School win
ning the beautiful library which has
been on exhibition at the Helvenston
store ever since the contest began.
The high school polled over a mil
lion votes,! while the next highest or
ganization was the Ocala lodge of
Elks, with the Ocala Public Library
third. .
The final count among the three
highest contesting organizations was
as follows:
Ocala High School. ........ 1,055,885
Ocala Lodge Elks.......... 642,565
Ocala Public Library. ... . . . 508,917
There: were a few scattering 'votes
for others, but not enough to get
them into the running.
This contest which began sixteen
weeks ago, started off easy, but as
the - count was published each' week
showing the standing of the num
erous organizations who were in the
contest, the interest deepened until
it included thousands of zealous pu
pils of the school and ardent mem
bers of lodges and other organiza
tions each bent on winning the prize
for their favorite. The work of the
School children was especially sys
tematic and earnest, Professor Con
nor having taken charge of the affair
for the pupils. Three clubs were or
ganized, the winning club' to be given
a party at the expense of the losers.
The contest was a clean one from
the start and kept so to the finish. A
number of out of town organizations
were enthusiastic for a time, but the
large bunches of ballots deposited by
the-Ocala' contestants evidently fright
ened them off. While some of them
made splendid, showings up to three
weeks ago, they evidently could not
see any chance for winning against
the strong work of the three leading
organizations who were working night
and day. '
The high school is to be congratu
lated upon winning for its library this
splendid collection of books.

Cleveland, Ohio, July 25. Twenty
two were killed and six are dying as
a result of an explosion in the gas
and water works tunnel five miles
from shore under Lake Erie. The
dead include workmen who were trap
ped by the explosion and ten rescuers.
Four of the seven men in the .first
rescue party died. Six of the eleven
in the second party were killed. The
third party of rescuers, wearing
oxygen helmets, brought out one
body and Gustav C. Vandusen, super
intendent of the water works con
struction. He may die.
The cause of the explosion has not
been determined.
PICK STRUCK A GAS POCKET
! The first alarm was given by Will
iam Donlan, the lock tender at the air
chamber entrance to the tunnel. Don
lan saved two members of the first
rescue party, then collapsed. The sec
ond rescue party saved one member
of the first. V
It is supposed that, a workman's
pick struck a gas pocket or an electric
spark ignited gas that had gathered
in the tunnel. Work, which was sus
pended for three days on account of
the presence of gas, was resumed last
night. ;. .

Pen With Which Credits Bill was
Signed Given to Senator Fletcher
by the President
Washington, July 22, 1916.
Editor Star: In the Associated
Press story of July 17, concerning the
signing of the rural credits bill by
President Wilson, appearing in the
Star of the same date under the cap
tion of "Rural Credits Bill,", the state
ment is made that the president used
two pens, "giving one to Senator
Fletcher of Florida to be presented to
the Southern Commercial Congress."
The part of the article quoted by me
is in error, as admitted to me by the
manager of the Associated Press this
morning. V
The facts are the pen was not given
to Senator Fletcher to be presented
to someone else. It was given to him
individually. The senator simply ask
ed the president if he would permit
the senator to so arrange it that the
Southern Commercial Congress, of
which he is the president, might share
with him the honor in some way.
In order that you may know exactly
what was said by the senator I en
close copy of his remarks to the presi
dent on the occasion and would ap
preciate it if you would make the cor
rection. Very truly,
J. M. Cathcart.
Senator Fletcher's Appreciation
Mr. President: I thank you exceed
ingly for this pen which has been the
instrument of impressing your ap
proval to a bill intended to establish
a system which will bring to agricul
ture, as you have suggested, long de
layed justice placing that essential
industry on an equal footing as to
financial operations with every other
important industry of the country. I
believe you will not consider it indi
cating any lack of appreciation on my
part, if I ask permission to find a way
to pass on some portion of the
honor, and have it share therein some
way, to the Southern Commercial Con
gress, without the efforts of which I
am sure we could not have accomr
pli shed this legislation, which means a
long step forward for the country, so
soon after the very earnest movement
for it was begun.
