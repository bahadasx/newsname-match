Dorbandt is reported to be planning
to contest the nomination of Orndorff
and may carry the case into court in
an effort to have the ballot boxes
opened and a new- count made. Poli
ticians on both the "rins 'and anti

contests in the past which failed to
change the results as they were an
nounced after the primary election.
However it is said that some of Dor

ing him to make the contest Should
the election be contested Orndorff w'll
be sworn in after the election in No

to oust him from office by court pro

The War At a Glance
THE British are holding all the
ground gained along the
Somme .front in northern
France against desperate counter
attacks by the Germans, according
to today's official statement from
London. The greater part of the
important fortified town of Po
zieres. which stands on high
ground vital to a further advance
toward Bapaume, is in British pos
session. North of the town, de
spite the strong opposition by the
Germans, additional ground has
been gained.
South of the Somme. the French
have made progress both to the
north and south of Soyecourt.
At Verdun there are indications
of an operation of importance
northeast of the citadel, a violent
bombardment being reported.

another tl ree ears the British isles I
will be entire!-, denuded of timber. I
One feature of the situation is that)
some ptewar sources of supply are no
longer available Fifty five percent of
timber imported in normal times came
from Russia. Sweden and Germany, four
percent from Norway, and 41 percent
from France. Portugal and Spain. Since
the war this country has had to rely
partly on supplies from Norway and
Sweden and largely on French and
Pi rtugest supplies, and to make good
the deficit from woods and forests in
the British Isles.
To maintain the supply the nation
is making huge inroads into its own
standing timber. It is impossible to
tr..el by rail through parts of Scot
lanu without seeing the wholesale cut
ting of trees. The axe is making a
clean sweep of whole woods.
