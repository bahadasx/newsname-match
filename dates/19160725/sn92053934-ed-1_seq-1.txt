GOTIATION
IN PROGRESS
FOR ISLANDS
United States Purposes to
Purchase Danish West
Indies by Treaty.
PRICE IS $25,000,000
Three Islands, St. Croix, St.
Thomas and St. John Lie
East of Porto Rico.
Washington, July 25. Official an
nouncement was made at the "White
house today that negotiations have
practically been completed for the pur
chase of the Danish West Indies by
the T'nited States from Denmark for
$25,000,000.
A treaty closing the transaction
probably will be signed today and im
mediately sent to the senate.
While details of the treaty were not
given out it is understood that the
I'nited States would come into com
plete possession of the islands. Word
has been received from Denmark that
the treaty is practically certain of be
ing ratified by the Danish parliament.
Chairman Stone of the senate for
eign relations committee, saw Presi
dent Wilson today, but said afterward
he had not discussed the purchase of
the Danish West Indies and knew
nothing of the question. It is under
stood the government hopes the treaty
will be ratified during the present ses
sion of congress.
Slnifeg-ic Location.
The three islands of the Danish
West Indies, St. Croix, St. Thomas and
St. John, lie due east of Porto Kico
ami their value to the Pnifed States is
strategic: from a military point of
view. The harbors of St. Thomas
and St. Croix are of first importance
to the American navy and St. Thomas
itself lies in the lane of shipping from
Europe to the Panama canal. Import
ant German, French and English mail
companies have coaling stations there.
The acquisition of the islands by the
I'nited States has been the subject of
unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations
since the civil war. Secretary Se
ward began negotiations for their
acquisition in 1M'5, because the naval
operations of the war had shown the
necessity of a base in the West Indies.
A treaty was made and ratified by
Denmark, but the United States sen
ate failed to act on it in proper time
and it lapsed. President Wilson in
his volume on congressional govern
ment, written about lvs", referred to
the incident as the "treaty marring
power of the senate."
Denmark Defeats Treaty.
Ineffectual efforts were made to re
open the negotiations during Presi
dent Grant's adtiiinistralion and in
lltiii', soon after President. Roosevelt
came into office. Secretary Hay took I
up the subject and Denmark offered;
the islands for five millions. The!
I'nited States senate this time ratified !
the treaty, but the Danish senate de- j
feated it. It was said at the time in j
diplomatic circles that German opposi- i
tion influential m the Danish parlia
ment was responsible for the defeat of
the plan. Later judgment, however,
attriiuitcnl the opposition to Danish
aristocrats. Thin opposition still is
said to exist, and it is said that if the
proposed treaty is ratified by both gov
ernments, the transfer will be sub
mitted to the people of the islands. In
the first negotiation in 1.V35 they ap
proved a c hange.

placed in the bill, when the Mexican'
situation was more critical. Another

The text follows:
"In the last few days the enemy
brought further reinforcements of in
fantry and guns to the Somme front.
Throughout yesterday the hostile bom
bardment was fairly continuous and
at times became very heavy.
"An attempt to attack our right
flank was made yesterday afternoon,
but. it was frustrated.
"Last night two further infantry!
attacks, prec eded by a specia.il- vio- j
lent artillery fire, were launched un-
successfully against the center of our i
lines. I
"At other parts of the line there
has been a great deal of hand to hand j
fighting and our infantry worked their I
way forward in places.
"North of Pozieres the enemy con
tinues! to offer strong opposition, but
here also we gained some ground and
captured two machine guns and a
few more prisoners, including two bat
talion commanders."

with Roy Hinterliter, son of a well-to-do
farmer of Olney. Hinterliter was
lodged in jail without bail.

Hinterliter had known Mi.-,s Rat

night he drove to the door of the Olney

Baltimore, Md., July 25. "Circum

have no control, are keeping us in
