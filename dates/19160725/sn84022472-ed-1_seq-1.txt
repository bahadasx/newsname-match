THREATEN TO ORGANIZE
NEW OPPOSITION PARTY
London,
July 25.-
-Apparently the
status of Ireland has gone steadily
from toadi to worse ever since the Sinn
Fein rising on Easter Sunday! for at
present the country is In the hamda of
a temporary and makeshift govern
ment composed of aj commission of
judges assisted by Major General Sir
John Maxwell, commander of the
British forces in Ireland, who. still Is
maintains ' military control over most
pf the ordinary police functions.
The office of Augustine Birrell, ex
ohief secretary for Ireland, remains
unfilled and Herbert Samuel, the bead
of the home office1, who has no special
knowledge of Irish affairs, represents
the Interest of Ireland in the cabinet
and before the House of Commons.
Great Britain finds itrjlf at one of
the most critical stages of Vie war
again distracted by wrangllngs over
the pror--m and with no light ahead.
The nationalist members In the. House
of Commons who, as a party,, thus far
have supported the government's war
and domestic measures, threaten to
shift their position and to become an
opposition party. The position of the
nationalists, moreover, is, anamolpub.
Discontent in Ireland over the -government's
dealings with the insurrection
has become so widespread, according
to f" reports, that the nationalists
have lost the confidence of their con
stituents ana probably would be re
pudiated, if they stood for re-election
today. -,

London,, July 25. British troops
have captured the greater part of the

ficial statement issued this afternoon.
The Germans . brought up reinforce
ments of infantry and guns, but th
counter attacks everywhere, the state-
ment adds, were repulsed by the BDW
having been splintered. It was hard
ly expected that the patient would
live but his extreme vitality has giv
en 'hope to the hospital staff..
Dr. F. P. Carroll of Bridgeport hos
pital, who has had charge of Hawley
during the absence of Dr. Patterson
from the city has had X-ray pictures
taken. It has not yet been deter
mined from the negatives taken just
what area of the spinal cord has been
ruptured. A further determination
will be made from the negatives late
this afternoon. .
. Physicians say that the cases of re
covery from broken neck are extreme
ly rare that method being utilized in
this and other states' for legal execu
tions under the death" penaltjt Deaith
is usually Instantaneous. ,
Though little hope Is held for ulti
mate recovery in the present case
should the supreme nervous cord of
the body be found not to be tor j to a
major degree the cHances for life will
be materially strengthened.

Mayor Wilson today said he would
not discuss the pavement situation in
Harrison street. He feaid he had been
grossly misquoted regarding the inter
view which he is. reported to have had
with Alexander Howell, president of
the. Animal. Rescue league. The mayor,
said the common council voted to lay
the Warrenite in .Harrison street and
the time Tor objection was when the
matterwaaflratbugh
tions blame the cabin3t, for its man
agement of the Irish question and re
gret the failure of a compromise, the
only conspicuous exception being the
Morning Post which consistently has
demanded the government of Ireland
by a strong hand and no home rule.
John Redmond, leader of the Irish
Nationalists, in his speech last night
said - v ,
"I will not hanby words about a
breach of faith or the violation of a
solemn agreement, but I want the gov
ernment clearly to understand that
they have entered . upon a course
which is bound to increase Irish sus
picion of the good faith of British
statesmen. To inflame feeling in Ire
land would do serious mischief to
those high imperial interests which
we are told necessitated a provisional
settlement of this" question. ?.
"Some tragic fatality seems to dog
the footsteps of this government in all
their dealings with Ireland. Every
step taken by them since coalition was
formed and especially since the un
fortunate outbreak in Dublin, has been
lamentable. They have disregarded
every advice we have tendered them,
and now, having got us to Induce our
people to make a tremendous sacri
fice and to agree to the temporary
exclusion of the six Ulster counties,
they throw this agreement to the
winds and have taken the surest
means to accentuate every possible
change and difficulty in the Irish slt-
uation."

taken to the Bridgeport hospital and
was reported out of danger this after

Though the forewoman in the de

ployed refused to ddscuss the details,
of the attempted suicide and a similar
attitude .was observed by other offi
cials .of th.e factory, it lias been said
on good authority that a young man
in whom Miss Kinnof is greatly inter

then he is said to -have been unable
to work and Miss Kinnof baa been.

today did her co-workers believe that
