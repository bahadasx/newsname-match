Rescuers working with oxygen helmets
at 10:15 a.m. had brought eight
bodies from the water works tunnel.
No more have been found alive. The
total number of bodies in the morgues
Is now ten.
All of the ten bodies so far recovered
re of members of the first and second
rescue parties. Eleven workmen originally
entombed are still buried. Rescuers
believe the tunnel caved in after
the explosion and remaining victims
are buried under tons of mud and may
not be reached for days.
Of the dead eleven were in the force
trapped by the explosion. The first
rescue party, consisted of seven men.
Four of them perished and three were
saved. The second rescue party comprised
eleven men. Six of these lost
their lives and five escaped. The first
rescue party accomplished nothing.
The second saved one of the first relief
expeditions. 'None has yet reached
any of the original party caught in the
workings. Of the eight rescued who
got out alive two died later. The
others may die. Two men were also
overcome by fumes who did not go into
the tunnel. v
A third rescue party entered the tunnel
at 8:30 and brought out alive Gustav
C. Van Duzen. superintendent of
waterworks construction, who had
headed the second relief force. Van
Duzen may die from his experiences.
One body was also brought out by the
third rescue party. This was a member
of the second rescue crew. It had
been supposed that Van Duzen had
perished.
- ' -We33t53r Without Helmets.
The tragic fate of the rescuers in the
first and second instances was due to 1
the fact that they worked without
oxygen helmets, which were unavaii- ,
bis.
For those rescued who afterward
died, no pulmotors were at hand for
use in Attempting to resuscitate them.
This lack of rescue apparatus was
roundly condemned by the rescuers,
and Mayor Harry L. Davis today promised
to conduct a rigid investigation
into this shortcoming, as well as into
the catastrophe itself.
The third rescue party was equipped
with helmets which had been assembled,
but nearly eleven hours had elapsed
following the explosion before sufficient
equipment to fit out the third rescue
party was at hand to permit a descent
into the tunnel.
The cause of the explosion has not yet
been ascertained. It is supposed that
some workman struck a pocket of gas
with a pick or possibly gas had collected
in the tunnel and become ignited by
an electric spark. The tunnel was
equipped with electrically driven machinery
for excavating.
Doortender Gives Alarm.
The party of eleven jrorkmen who
were caught by the explosion entered
the tunnel at 8 o'clock last night. The
work has been carried on in three
shifts. This shift was in charge of
Harry Volkes as shift boss.
First intimation of the disaster came
when William J. Dolan. lock tender in
the air chamber at the entrance to the
tunnel, heard the dull boom of an explosion.
This was about 9:30 p.m. Dolan
was thrown against the door leading
from the air chamber into the tunnel.
This door was jammed by the blast,
and deadly fumes poured out of the
tunnel, almost overcoming Dolan. He
finally managed to close it. and then releasing
the high pressure from the air
chamber he opened the door leading
to the crib above and gave the alarm to
men at the surface of the lake.
Supt. John Johnson summoned volunteers
and led the first rescue party of
volunteers down the elevator and into
the tunnel. One hundred and fifty feet
from the bottom of the shaft they began
to stumble, crumple and fall, overcome
by fumes.
Doian. who had resumed his post in
the air chamber, rushed after them.
He saw a flash of light in the darkness.
It proved to be Johnson's fiashj
light, which he still grasped where
I he had fallen. Dolan dragged him to
the bottom of the elevator shaft and
want back. Almost dead himself ha
dragged Peter MeKenna to safety. Then
ha collapsed. Others from the crib
took the three up the elevator and they
ware placed aboard boats which had
been attracted from shore by rockets
Organizes Rescue Party.
It was two hours later that Van
Duien, who had been summoned from
his home by telephone, organized the
second rescue party on shore and went
to the crib. With his men he descended
Into the tunnel. His men found Michael
Keough of the first rescue party still
alive and dragged him out. They went
in again, only to suffer the same fate
which had befallen the first party.
Finally four of them managed to stagger
back to safety. The others did not
come out until the third rescue party
was organized and went after them.
Jt was then that Van Duzen was
brought out.
It became known today that work
In the tunnel bad been suspended three 1
days ago because gas was found. The
men sent Into the tunnel last night
went to work believing the gas had
been eliminated.
"We should never have gone Into the
tunnel last night," said Dolan today.
We never got a report from the
1 ih.-mist whether the place was safe
u nd clear of gas, but they said It was
all right for us to go."

Cleveland with all possible speed.
There were six engineers in the party.
Mayor Davis and Chief of Police W.
S. Howe went to the scene in a tug
early today.
The construction job on which the
loss of life occurred is being done by
the city with direct labor. It consists
in building a tunnel from the water
works intake crib, known as crib Xo.
5, to the new filtration plant being
built at West 58th street. This tunnel
will carry water to the filter plant,
now nearing completion, which will
filter the water supply of what is called
t^e "west_ side" section of the city.
Crib No. 5 is five miles from shore.
The tunnel has been constructed between
the shore and crib No. 4. which
is two anri nne.Vii If miloo v, ^
The section on which work is being
done is between cribs Nos. 4 and 5.
Fifteen hundred feet remain to be
completed. The men who were first
trapped were working: 1,700 feet toward
the shore from crib No. 5. The lake
at crib 5 is seventy feet. The tunnel
is fifty feet under the bottom of the
lake and ten feet in diameter. An
elevator shaft leads from crib No. 5 to
the tunnel entrance.
Mayor Orders Investigation.
Mayor Davis issued a statement at
noon, in which he said:
"The construction of the water works
tunnel was begun under the previous
administration, and the supervision has
been in charge of men selected by that
administration. They have been supplied
with all the equipment ttaey have
asked for. I supposed they had all
they needed. An investigation into the
entire disaster will start Wednesday
with Law Director W. S. Fitzgerald in
charge. This inquiry will go to the
bottom of the affair and fix any responsibility
for the tragedy, and for
lack of rescue apparatus. Meanwhile,
everything possible will be done to
care for the families of the victims."
The previous administration to which
the mayor referred was that headed by
Newton D. Bak,er, now Secretary of
War.
In addition to the city probe, there
will be three investigations of the
horror?by the federal, state and county
authorities. L'nited States mine inspectors
telegraphed city officials today
they would arrive tomorrow to conduct
an inquiry into the disaster. The state
industrial commission also sent word
that it would send representatives here
for an inquiry, while Coroner P. J.
Byrne announced that his inquest into
the deaths of victims would take the
form of a county probe.

BIG FIGHT PENDING
OVERVALUATIONS
Capital Traction Company Refuses
to Accept Utilities
f!Ammiceinn Pctimotoc 1
WWMItlMUUIVII taVllVliaibOl
Another big fight faces the public
utilities commission in its valuation
work, the Capital Traction
Company today serving notice
that it will not accept the commission's
tentative estimate of the
worth of its property.
Surprised by the commission's
low rating?a surprise that penetrated
local financial circles as
well?officials of the company
made it plain that unless the commission
alters its ratings they will
carry the case to the courts.
"We have read but not examined carefully
the valuation report of the utilities
commission of the District of Columbia,**
said George E. Hamilton, president of
the company today.
"The figures given as representing the
estimates of cost of the reproduction of
the physical property, and the original
cost of the company's property, by the
commission's valuation bureau, admitted- '
ly falls short of showing the full value of
the company's properties. The figures ,
contained in this report are so much
lower than the actual values as known to
us, and, as ascertained by a recent verj'
careful examination made by experts of
the highest standing, that we are absolutely
at a loss to express an opinion as
to the results of the work by the commission.
"Beyond this we are unwilling to make
any statement until permitted before the
commission and the courts to supplant j
theory with fact.'' I
Great Surprise Caused.
No valuation thus far announced by
the commission has caused more surprise 1
generally than that given out for the j
Capital Traction Company. The rating [
amounts to only about 50 per cent of the I
company's capitalization. 1
The valuation given the Potomac Elec- 1
trie Power Company, which is being vig- }
orously contested by the company, shows 1
a more favoraoie proportion to capitaliza- .
tion.
With one fight on its hands, in connec- '
tion with the power company; another
promised by the Capital Traction Company
and still others likely to develop as
its valuation work progresses, the public J
utilities commission faces a long task 1
In establishing its valuations for rate
making and otner purposes. rears may
elapse before the litigation finally is setlied.
]
W. R. and E. Valuations. i
After announcing its rating for the 1
Capital Traction Company yesterday j 1
morning, the utilities commission last j '
night gave out its tentative ascertain-' 1
merits of value for the Washington Rail- j '
way and Electric Company. <
The amount shown by the company's '
books as expended in the construction and i
acquisition of road, equipment and real
estate now in existence is placed at 18, 1
270,351.38. Reproduction cost is given at 1
110,253,150.63. and reproduction cost less <
depreciation at 17,853,822.14. |
These- figures do not Include the <
property of the Potomac Electric 1
power Company, the Georgetown and i
Tennallytown' Railway Company and i
the City and Suburban Railway of i
Washington, all subsidiary companies, i
which are being valued separately. .
Inasmuch as the ratings for all the
subsidiary companies have not been an- 1
nounced. it is not possible at this time a
to determine how the total valuation r
will compare with the company's total r
capitalisation. t
Officials of the Washington Railway t
and Electric Company today declined to t

but;. Intimated that they might have t

While details of the treaty were not

has been received from Denmark that
the treaty is practically certain of
being ratified by the Danish parliament.
The United States will obtain from
Denmark full possession of the islands
of St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix,
or Santa Cruz, as it is better known.
These islands lie about fifty miles off
the east coast of Porto Rico. They are
142 square miles in area and support a
population of 27,000 persons. Nearly
all the inhabitants of the islands are
negroes, who live by the cultivation
of cane sugar.
Senator Stone, chairman of the Senate
foreign relations committee, saw
President Wilson today, but said afterward
that he had not discussed the
purchase of the Danish West Indies
and knew nothing of the question.
Of Strategic Value.
The three islands of the Danish
West Indies?St. Croix, St. Thomas and
St. John?lie due east of Porto Rico
and their value to the United States is
strategic from a military point of
view. The harbors of St. Thomas and
St. Croix are of first" importance to the
American navy, and St. Thomas itself
lies in the lane_ of shipping from I
Europe to the ranarou ?n. important
German, French and English
mail companies have coaling stations
there.
The acquisition of the islands by the
United States has been the subject of
unsuccessful diplomatic negotiation
since the civil war. Secretary Seward
began negotiations for their acquisition
in 1865 because the naval operations
of the war had shown the necessity
of a base in the West Indies. A
treaty was made and ratified by Denmark.
but the United States Senate
failed to act on it in proper time and
it lapsed. President Wilson in his
volume on congressional government
written about 1883. referred to the incident
as the -treaty-marring power
pf the Senate."
Ineffectual efforts were made to reopen
the negotiations during President
Grant's administration, and in 1902,
soon after President Roosevelt came
into office. Secretary Hay took up the
subject and Denmark offered the
islands for five millions.
The United Ctates Senate this time
ratified the treaty, but the Danish
senate defeated it.
Opposed by the Aristocrat*
It was said at the time In diplomatic j
circles that German opposition influen- j
tial in the Danish parliament was re- I
sponsible for the defeat of the plan.
Later judgment, however, attributed
the opposition to Danish aristocrats.
This opposition still is said to exist,
and it is said that if the proposed
treaty is ratified by both governments
the transfer will be submitted to the
people of the islands. In the first negotiations,
in 1865, they approved a
change.
The three islands of St. Croix. St.
Thomas and St. John, in the order of !
their size and population, were discovered

miles east of Porto Rico, and is less I
than 1,200 miles from the entrance to '
the Panama canal, was at one time
the chief distributing center of West
Indian trade, its importance being directly
attributable to the fact that the
mother country, Denmark, maintained
its neutrality during the numerous
European Avars of the eighteenth century.
Occupied by the British.
The temporary occupation of the island
by the British during several pe- j
riods of the Napoleonic wars added ?

feet of water, the roadstead can ac- ]

has tried in vain to revive by
granting annual subsidies.

Only Two Colonies Left.
If Denmark decides to part with the
Islands there will remain to her only
two colonial possessions?Greenland and
Iceland, which have an aggregate area
more than five times as large as the f
mother country, but with only one-twenty-seventh
the population. The 138
square miles of Denmark's West Indian
territory sustain nearly three times as
many people as the 46,740 square miles
of Greenland.
Naval officers regard the Danish
West Indies as most valuable for any
European government wishing to quarrel
with the United States, and have
urged it was essential to the largest
degree to keep them from falling into
unfriendly hands. They have pointed
out that they are very near the naval )
station at Guantanamo, only a thousand
miles from Key West and a menace
to the free navigation of the Windward
and Mona passages, the Caribbean
sea and the routes to American
Atlantic coast cities. ?.
Denmark's huge expenses since the
beginning of the war are said to be
responsible for her willingness to sell
the islands.

BILLJSRiEPORTED
House District Committee
Also Favors "Real Consideration"
Bill.
The House District committee todayreported
the "community forum bill,"
and also the bill requiring that a real
consideration for money received in
real estate transactions be recited in
the deed.
The community forum bill, the subject
of much discussion and adverse
comment in the citizens' associations
of the District, was amended in the
committee by adopting Representative
Ragsdale's suggestion that provision for
the color line should be strictly drawn
in the bill.
The bill, as reported, has an important
change from the first community
forum bill as originally Introduced.
The original bill would have
given the Commissioners of the District
ail the jurisdiction over school
buildings when used for public forum
purposes, thus taking away from the
board of education any authority in
the matter, but leaving them with the
entire responsibility of the property.
The bill as reported today provides
that the authority and responsibility
shall rest entirely with the board of
education. It was on this point that
many citizens of the District protested
to the District committee at the
hearing at which Miss Margaret Wilson
appeared as the leading advocate
of the measure.
The bill provides that twenty adult
persons, all being parents of children
enrolled as pupils in a public scrool,
may organize for a community forum
purpose and receive the permission of
the board of education to use the
neignDornooa scnooi.
Board Must Co-Operate.
The bill makes it necessary that the
board of education shall cooperate
with the community forum and make
all necessary arrangements in the
school building for the comfort of the
meetings.
The "real consideration" bill, which
is a measure well known in the District
yT Columbia for several years past, specifies
that it shall be unlawful tor the recorder
of deeds to record any deed of
conveyance of any real estate in the District
unless it is accompanied by a statement,
subscribed and sworn to, setting out
:he entire and real consideration actually
passed between the buyer and seller.
The bill provides that "no consideration
greater than that fully expressed
in the conveyance shall be or become a
lien upon the property described in the
said deed of conveyance."
The committee' also reported a bill
which has already passed the Senate
providing that the Baltimore and
IX" q ah In o-tnn Trnnnit rnmnaav n f \(orv.
land shall be allowed to lay rails within
the District of Columbia.
Must Oct British India Permit.
The British embassy today advised
:hose other than British subjects deitring
to go to British India for mislionary
or educational work that
hereafter they will have to receive
ipecial permission from the Indian auhorities,
and that, as it will take
iome time to carry out such negotia;ions,
arrangements for the journey
ihould not be made until the permit
im been granted. ...
