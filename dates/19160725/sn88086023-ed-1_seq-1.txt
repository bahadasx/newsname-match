Dr. Smith Opposes
Port District For
Pitman Enterprise
IN Ills CASK FREIGHT EXPENSES
WOULD HE INCREASED OVER
HATES NOW PAID.
That It would be a blunder to form
a port district and to bond the same
to build the proposed Pitman road
way to Umatilla is the declaration of
Mr. C. J. Smith who Is here today
Don) Portland. The doctor's Helix
ranch of 16uu acres is included in the
bouadarl of the district.
Even if the roadway Is practicable
(of which there is doubt) It would
Btill be a bad thing from my stand
point. At present my wheat can ba
hauled to Helix for two and a half
cents a bushel, while the rate from
Helix to Portland Is 1-4 cents thus
making a total rate of 10 3-4 cents.
"Now the boat rate at present from
I matilla to Portland Is 7 1-2 cents
To reach the Pitman road from my
place would cost four cents per bush
el and the rate on the roadway to
UmatlDa could not be less than two
ci nts per bushel. If two cents my
combined rate via I'matllla to Port
land would be 13 cents or two and a
fourth cents more than I am paying
now.

improvements in general but we
should be sure of our ground before
going ahead with anv large expendi
