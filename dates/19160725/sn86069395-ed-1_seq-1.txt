MARCHING HOME
Rejected Men Returned From
Ft. Thomas Sunday
Morning.
LIEUT. BUTLER IN CHARGE
Much Regret Is Expressed at
the Failure of Lieut. But-
ler to Pass.
Forty-five bravo Hopkinsville boys,
who left with Company D for Fort
Thomas and have been in camp there
since their departure, arrived back
homo at ten o'clock Sunday morning,
glad to sec their parents and friends,
but seriously unhappy because they
wero not allowed to fulfill their patri
otic intentions of accompany the Third
Regiment to the border and were
rejected on account of minor physical
defects.
The boys were a plucky, brave lot
of fellows that Hopkinsville may well
be proud of. They looked healthy
and strong enough to .make any
Greaser run, but the army regulations
are necessarily stringent and the boys
who returned realized that they were
not turned down because of any fault
of their own. Many of the rejections
came from bad teeth or under weight
or height. Some of the men who
were rejected will try to get them
selves up fo the standard and re
enlist.
Lieut. Riley Butler was in charge
of the special car that brought the
soldiers back. Lieut, uutler was re
jected because he was under weight.
He is considered one of the best
soldiers in the regiment. He will m
crease his weight and try to get up to
the required standard before tho reg
iment entrains for the border. He
has the opportunity of joining an en
gineering or artillery force should
these be added to the Kentucky Bri
gade.
Every effort was made to retain
Lieut. Butler. The officers of the
regiment and brigade made strong
solicitation to. the War Department
and failed only because so many oth
er officers, who were rejected, were
also striving to retain their places in
the service. It is believed that Lieut.
Butler will be given a regimental
commission immediately, should he
be able to increase his weight enough
to permit his re-enlistment. His place
will be filled by a member bf the
company. First Sergeant Cecil Arm
strong is in line for the place by or
der of succession and it is understood
that he will bo tho company's choice.
Lieut. Butler comes of fighting
stock, the nested Butlor family that
through its different branches gave a
General to each side in the Civil War.
His ancestors come to Kentucky from
the Carolinas and he is closely relat
ed to Gen. M. C. Butler, of South
Carolina, whoso son, Col. M. C. But
ler, was murdered at Alpine, Texas,
last week. Lieut. Butler was born
I Mar. 2, ioo7, in Hopkins county, Ky.,
j and attended military schools for six,
'years and has for the last ten years
! been in the Stalo Guards. For 13
months during tho night rider trouble;
he was on active duty as a scout.
I Lieut. Butler is in excellent physical
I condition, an accepted risk of soveral
.old lino insurance companies, and
his light weight is the only obstaclo
to his acceptance. He isin. accom
plished soldier, an expert marksman
'and a highly. intelligent officer. lie
is a graduate engineer and would be
useful in many -wys in tho event of
war.

LOCAL NAN
i fOR CONGRESS
Socialists Nominate
Tefteller Congressman In
Second District.
WAS FORMER POPULIST.
Has Lived Here Three Years;
Stumping Campaign
Planned.
C. G. Tefteller, Hopklnsvillc's lead
ing Socialist, has received word of his
nomination by that party for Congress
in the Second District. Mr. Tefteller
is an ardent Socialist and this honor
comes as a lust reward trom tne
party. He has been prominently iden
tified with it in this and other states
since his conversion into the Socialist
ranks.
The primary for the nomination
was held by referendum. One of the
local Socialists organizations made the
nomination and ballots were mailed
to all the members of the party in the
district so that they could make their
votes. Mr. Tefteller was unanimously
selected in this district.
Mr. Tefteller moved to Hopkinsville
three vears aco. He has been a
Socialist leader here since that time.
The candidate was interviewed by
a KentucKian reporter yesteruay
morning. He was in his overalls in
the steaming room at Metcalfe's laun
dry, where he is washman.
"I intend to take some of the dirt
out of nolitics like I am taking it out
of these clothes;" he said.
Mr. Tefteller is a native of Texas.
He began his political career with the
Populist party. He tells an interesting
story of his change to the Socialist be
lief.
It happened eight years ago. He
and Judge W. E.'Peck were stumping
Grayson County in a joint debate,
being the opposing candidate for Con-
mwr i I 1 1 t - 1
gress. when tney met on me stump
atabigbarbecue Mr. Tefteller opened
the argument and outlined his views.
When Judge Peck went to speak
he said, "I can't offer any opposition
to this man's beliefs. Heisn'ta Popu
list, he is a Socialist himself." Mr.
Tefteller discussed the matter further
with Judge Peck and by the end of
the campaign was convinced that he
had been mistaken in politics and was
a Socialist in heart.
Mr. Tefteller stated this morning
that he would make speeches through
out the District. He said that the party
would be unable to conduct an ex
tensive campaign on the stump. He
stated that the effort it would make
would be to double the vote in the
District this year.
This will satisfy them.
Mr. Tefteller repudiates the idea
that Socialists seek to turn the social
order upside down in a social revolu-
tion.
"We only strive to establish great
reforms littlo by little until our ideal
is reached." He said. "'Our principal
campaign will'be anti-military and in
favor of government ownership of as '
many public utilitios, by purchase, as
is consistent with common sense."
' Teachers' Institute.
The Christian County Institute for
yjiite teachers will be held in Hop
kinsville on August 14-19.
Ur. b. C. McDougal, head of the
Lastcrn State Normal school, will bo
the, Instructor.
The session will be held at theHigl
acnooi or Uclmont School.

Dy Charlie Hawkins, recentlv. was

Lightning Strikes.
A cabin on the farm of W. T. Rosp
near Lafayette, and a stablo on the
farm T. II, Elliott, were struck by
lightning and considerably damaged
Wednesday night. No one was 'hurt i
at either place. ! -
