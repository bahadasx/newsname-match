TO THE BRITISH
London, July 25. The coalition.
cabinet waa endangered today by the
Irish question. David Lloyd-George,
minister of war and originator of the
compromise plan for settlement of
the Irish problem, waa quoted aa hav
ing offered to resign In view erf the
failure of the cabinet to acquiesce In
his proposals to the Irish nationalists.
Premier Asqulth waa understood to
be ready also to step down It Lloyd
George retired. Threat to submit
the question to a vote of the people
In general election was freely made
during the commons' debate.
. The only hope of averting such a
break lay today In the chance that
the Irish nattonallsta would consent
to further negotiations with John
Redmond, the party's leader, de
manding Immediate action, and his
followers burling charges of breach
of faith at the ministry, it was ad
mitted this hope was a 'faint one.
Some 'London newspapers today ex
pressed the belief, however, that It
the break came and a general elec
tion were called, It would result In
support of . the cablnet'a course, the
nattonallsta, having lost the confi
dence of -many Irishmen through
their willingness to treat in a com
promise plan. Such a victory tor
the cabinet would, however; It was
pointed out, still leave the IrUh ques
tion suspended.
The situation today was that the

there was a complete, agreement

Upheld by Higher Courts
Portland, July 15. An opinion
rendered today by Circuit Judge Mor
row, should it be auatained by the
higher courts, strike a aerere blow
at the Oregon "dry" law, In the opin
ion of the'dlstrlct attorney.
In overruling the demurrer to the'
complaint in the suit of the Wadhama
k Company against the San Fran
cisco k Portland Steamship company,
Judge Morrow holds that the provi
sion In the prohibition law limiting
to wholesale druggists the right to
Import alcohol In large quantities Is
In . violation of the interstate com
merce clause of the federal constitu
tion. He holds that any genuine
manufacturer may Import as much
alcohol as he desires for his own
use.'' " '
Judge Morrow pointed out that
while his decision might result In
many pseudo manufacturing plants
springing np, it would be the district
attorney's 4hity to prevent auoh rn-
tltutiona from 'becoming "blind
Pigs."
Arthur Murphy, deputy district at
torney, said: i
"If the courts hold that It la un
constitutional to prohibit a manu
facturer from importing alcohol but
permit him to use alcohol, then the
provision which prohibits a ' man
from buying more than two quarts of
whiskey but permits him to possess
whiskey must be unconstitutional,
too. So there .will be nothing left
of the law."
(MM WET
Retention in parliament of the na
tionalist representation In undimin
ished numbers was the main' point
which invented agreement dn the
cabinet on the bill and among the
various Irish parties.
One other point which gave anxiety
was the open threat, voiced by Red
mond In the commons' debate, that
the Irish members held themselves
free to exercise their individual judg
ment In criticising the government'a
course, not only In domestic affairs
but In the conduct of the war. It
was admitted that it the Irish de
liberately seek, as this threat Indi
cates, to air British conduct of the
war on the floor, they may seriously
embarrass British success in the pre
sent great offensive.
"It is humiliation to us In the
face of our friends and our foes at
a time when we claim to be fighting
the battle of the small and weak na
tionalities," the Dally News said. "It
means that the sympathy of the
United States Is lost to us and tho
whole sentiment of the dominions la
against us."
"Now we have-the bid stone tied
once more round our neck In a hea
vier and more dangerous shape than
ever," said the Dally Telegraph. "We
shall be fortunate if It does not ham
per our progress at every' step
through the deep waters which have
yet to ba traversed." v
Evidencing the cruotsl nature of
the situation, Premier Asqulth today
conferred with A. J. Balfour, Con
servative Leader Bonar-Law, Minister
of War Lloyd-George and Austin
Chamberlain, secretary of state for
India, and later bad
