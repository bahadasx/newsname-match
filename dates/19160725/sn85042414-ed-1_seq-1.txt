HIGH CHARACTER
Amusement Program This
Year also One of Unusual
Attractiveness.
Despite the fact. that lowering
clouds presaged bad weather for the
afternoon and evening,- a large crowd
today assisted In the opening of the
Grand Porks Mr, which this year em
braces North Dakota and northwest
am Minnesota. The heavy rain of the
night did no more than settle the dust
oa the roads and place the race track
(n excellent condition for the after
noon program, but it, together with
the cloudy weather of the morning,
affected the crowds somewhat. But
nevertheless, it was an unusually good
opening day and many people, chiefly
from the northeastern section of the
state, attended.
Exhibits Arrive.
Practically every exhibit was in
place when this gates were thrown
open at 10 o'clock. In fact, there
•were only one or. two booths in the
14beral Arts building that were not
ready when the people were admitted.
It was not long, however, before every
place was ready'.for exhibit purposes.'
Ralph Hanklnson and his auto polo
teams and the Kilties band, the last
"*0f the twe special attractions to'teach
the olty,' arrived in Grand Forks .this
mofnHtg. Mr. Hanklnson's teams are
composed of the same men as last

the party, but he was forced to leave
them several days ago because of the
death of a sister. He will Join the

Walter Raub, intrepid balloonist, Is
ready to thrill fkir crowds. A new
red, white arid blue balloon, built es
pecially for the Grand Forks fair, will
be used and.. Mr. Raub promises sev
eral new things in the way of thrills.

Grand fetand Acts.
The grand stand attractions are un
usually good. The work of the Jap
aorob&ts, the cyclists, the aerialists
and the comedians was a big part of
the afternoon's amusement.
Judging Begins.
The work of Judging was com
menced as soon as the gates were
opened. The Judging rings were the
.oenter of large groups during the en
tire forenoon, and much progress was
made in awarding prizes.
H. O. Gramltch of Lincoln, Neb., is

Midway Shows.
The Midway this year is one of the
heat, .If not the best in- the History of
Orand Forks fairs. The attractions
an furnished by the Great Patterson
shows, which include some of the
greatest carnival features In the coun
try. Evidence of the enthusiasm of
the first-day crowd and of the fact
that the- weather has not dampened
the ardor of merry-makers was found
on the Midway this morning. Within
a few minutes after the gates were
opened, "barkers" were at work and
soon filled several' of the tents. Three
or four of the places gave three shows
during the morning. The afternoon
shows began at 2 o'clock.
Baily this afternoon the Patterson
show* gave a small parade. The
parade was led by Mrs. Raymond
Blder, wife of the general manager,
on her beautiful black horse. Then
followed the four trained bulls, haul
ing the band wagon, the performing
elephants and other features of the
animal show.
Games of Skill.
The concessions this year are better
than at any previous fair. Games of
chance are taboo, but seekers of dolls
and other souvenirs are finding no
difficulty in getting them, providing,
of course, they are skillful at throw
ing basketballs and baseballs. Every
thing Is decided by skill.
The race program this afternoon
Ineluded the 2:12 and 2:3d paces, and
there wore some unusually good en

The three Islands of the Danish
West Indies—St. Croix, St. Thomas

lies in the larie of shipping from
Europe to the Panama canal. Im
