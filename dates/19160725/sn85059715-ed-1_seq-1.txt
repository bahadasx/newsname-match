CLEVELAND, O.. July 25?1Twenty-two
ruon are dead and half a dozen
others are dying as the result of
an explosion of gas In a waterworks'
tunnel five tulles from shore underneath
Lalte Erie late Monday night.
The dead Include workmen who
were trapped in the tunnel when the
gas exploded and members of two
rescue parlies who attempted to save
the men first trapped.
Of the dead eleven were in the
force trapped by the explosion. None:
of these escaped. The first rescue'
party consisted of seven men. Four
of them perished and three were
snved. The second rescue party com-j
prised eleven men. Six of these lost
their lives and five escaped, 'l'tie
first rescue party accomplished noth
Inpr. The second saved one of the
first relief expedition. No one has
yet reached any of the original elev- j
en caught in the working. Of thoj
eight rescuers who cot out alive two
died later; the others may die. Two i
others who did not go Into the tunned
were overcome hv fumes.
A third rescue party entered the
tunnel at 8.30, and brought out |
alive Gustav C. Van Duzen, superintendent
of waterworks construction.
who had headed the second relief
force. He may die from his ex-i
perlence. One hodv also was brought
out by the third rescue party. This
was a member of tlie second rescue
Van Duzen had perished.
The tragic fate of the rescuers in
the first and second Instances was I
due to the fact that they worked j
without helmets which were unavailable.
Of those rescued who after- j
ward died no pulmotors were at |
hnnd for use in attempting to resuscitate
them. Tills lack of rescue ap

The third rescue party was equipped
with helmets which had been assembled
but nearly eleven hours had
elapsed following the explosion hpfore
sufficient equipment to fit out

The party of workmen caught by.
the explosion entered the tunnel at j
8 o'clock Monday night. First inti-j
matlon of the disaster came when
William J. Dolnn. lock tender in the'
air chamber at the entrance to the
tunnel, heard the dull boom of an
explosion. This was about !)..10 p. m.
Dolan was thrown against the door
leading from the air chamber Into
the tunned. This door was Jammed
by the blast and deadly fumes poured
out of the tunnel almost overconi-|
lug Dolan. He finally managed to,
close it and then releasing the high
pressure from the air chamber he
opened the door leading to the crib

the surface of the lake. Superintended

him to the bottom of the eh?.r

himself, he dragged Peter McKenna
to safety. Then he collapsed. Others

Deeper Wells May Result in
Strikes Yielding Large
Production.
Wlthi na few hourR a huge bit will
begin to bore down deep Into the
bowels of the earth In Harrison county,
possibly to prove what geologists
suspect, that the great gas fields of
West Virginia arc underlaid with a
gas sand and possibly an oil sand
with a pressure and How greater than
any yet released to supply the industries
of that great tenter of progress
now supplied from tills state. This
test will not be nltogether a blind
one; a well completed not long ago
to a considerable depth on the edge
of Harbour county, gives hope that
with modern equipment natural gas

any from which tlio present supply
is obtained.
Pioneers in this present deep drilling
are tho Hope Natural Gas Company,
the big subsidiary of the Standard
Oil Company, operating In this
state, and the Grasselli Chemical
Company, whose big plants are located
at Grasselli and Zieslng.
The Grasselli company has now the
derrick comploted and is "rigging
up" to begin drilling on the Isaac
Maxwell farm in this county. S. \V.
Bowman and Son o( Clarksburg have
the contract. While the plans have
been kept secret, Ills understod that
the drilling company is beginning operations
with the Intent of drilling
down to a depth of 10,000 feet. The
location of tho well Is in proved natural
gas territory. Complete records
of this well will no doubt bo taken
and kept from the lop of the soil till
the object sought for Is found or operations
are halted or ended by the
difficulties of deep drilling.
Second Boep Test.
Another deep well will be drilled,
this one by the Hope Natural Gas
Company, on the .Mary GofT farm at
Bridgeport, this county, and east of
this city a short distance. The derrick
Is up for this tost, and the same
company, It Is undorstood, has made
one or two other locations for deep
tests.
If these test wells discover in lower
strata another gas sand, the life
of natural gas production in West
Virginia will be much prolonged, as
It Is confidently expected that If gas
ts discovered the rock pressure win
be higher than in the upper sands,
and probably the How more constant.
Clarksburg will sec the new boom of
gigantic proportions, industries
which have located here will be assured
of natural gas for many years
to come, and leasca which are now
producing revenue to land owners
and othprs because the pressure in
wells has decreased below the pressure
of the mains, will be revived as
