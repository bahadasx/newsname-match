It is for this, then, that the British
are fighting so desperately, that they
have succeeded, according to the offi
cial reports, in elef ring the Germans out
of the town, save for some houses oa
the -eastern and northern fringe, where
the Teutons still hold out, under heavy
Are.
from Tbiepval, now in the hands of
the British colonial troops, to Ouille
moat the lighting of the last twenty
four hours has been tremendous. For
repelling attacks the Germans hae
been relying upon "the multiplicity of
machine-guns and hand grenades with
whieh their infantry has been liberally
supplied. But according to the British
statements, issued last night, the heavy
cost involved in the taking of the
necessary positions in this line had
little appareat weight with the com
manders or the men who had, to do the
actual wokk. The British report sue
eeaa all along this Use.
Trench Pause Awhile
' On the French aide of the 8omme the
fighting has paused for a time, save for
the customary artillery fighting. There
was some -minor lighting south of Gs
trees and between that town and Bnlloy
en Bant, where there have been some
heavy counter-attacks by the Germans,
who apparently hoped to be able to
bend in the French line, and threaten
the flank of the Trench troops menac
ing Peronne. The attacks were re
pulsed and the French officers report
having erttured a German battery
, south of Estrees.
Berlin, in the official report of the
Western fighting, says that the only
advantage won by the British yester
day, was" some' houses in Poiieres,
whieh cost the British heavy losses.'
The BerHa official Itatemeat also
mentions that in the battle of Bundar
at this point the "Brandenburg Grei
adiers of Doiiaumont fame" defeated
the BritiHh. This is taken to indicate
that the reports of French and British
officials that the Germans have been
compelled to wibdraw troops from the
Verdun front to hold back the Allies
on the Homme ware correct.

The lighting north of Verdun yes
terday was resumed by the French
who reports having taken the redoubt
to the westward of Thiaumont, fur
which they have' been struggling for
several days.
From the battle-fields of Bussia nnd
Oalicla came the Sensational report that
Field Marshal von Uindenburg has

south of Riga, and that the Russians
have been able to penetrate the Gor

miles and cut the Teuton line of com

EL PASO, "July 25. General Gon

protested to Oen. George Bell,
Jr., commanding the Fifth Brigade at
Kl Pasoi against an alleged violation
of good faith on the part of the out
post guards of the Ninth Massachu

Gonzales charges that the outpost
guards crossed the border "in
violation of Mexican rights, and ahot
up, without provocation, a number of
homes."
The outpost guards claim that they
were shot at first. Tbe Mexican sol
diers assert that they themselvee fired
no shots.
General Bell, shortly after the re
ceipt of the Mexican protest, sent an
answer to General Gonsales aaying
thut the reports he had received of
tbe shooting across the river led him
to believe that the American militia
men were not at all to blame.
He said that six outlaws, belonging
to a gang of Villa sympathisers, have
ramie a rendesvous at a place called
"The Island", not far from El Paso,
and were responsible for the exchange

The Philadelphia Ledger this

correspondent in Copenhagen, to
the effect tliat the treaty between , ,
the two countries providing , for '.
the sale of the jslands soon will
be ready for submission o the
senate and the Danish parlia- t
inent. r ' " .
According to this despatch the
United States is to pay $25,000,-,,;.'
000 for the possessions of the Dan-
ish government in the .West In
dies, and to cede to Denmark all ;
claims upon Greenland which the
United States may have, based '
upon the discoveries of the Amer-! ,
ican Arctic explorers. '
Old Negotiations Continued '
These negotiations are believed
to be the continuation of those V
which beginning in; 1901 and last
ing intermittently v until 1910, V
were broken off owing , to .the
difticulty the representatives of ,'.',
the two nations had in, reaching .
a satisfactory agreement. V
' Now, however, the situation is
different. Denmark is reoorted to
be severely pinched by the strain
of keeping her army mobilized to
maintain Iter neutrality, and needs
money badly. I ti addition, she is
anxious to rid herself of a trouble
some element in maintaining that
neutrality, for which "she had
worked so hard since -the out
break of the war.
Ideal Naval Station ' .
From the point of view of the
United States the possession of
the Danish West Indies has long
lieen a dream of the Strategists
f the naval board. The islands
arc ideal for a coaling station off
the eastern coast, better by far
that the station at Guantanamo,
Cuba, and as a naval base also
they are superior.
