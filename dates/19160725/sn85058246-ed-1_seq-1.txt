SERGEANT HATCH
WRITES FATHER
FROMJOGALES
H. E. Hatch, president nf tho
Thatcher Bros. Banking Company of
this city, lins Just received a letter
from hts son, J. Eastman, who Is a
sergeant In Troop H. First Cavalry,
N O. U-, which gives some Very In
teresting detail about the trip to the
border and camp life of tin; Lcgan'
boys who went with our troop of ool
dler boys. ,
Ho snys tho Utah camp is known
as Camp William Spry, with htlU all
about which nre especially beautiful
this time of tho year. Tho Utah
camp is one of the most Ideal, belli?
eltuatcd on a side hill, opposite tho,
Mexican border. From Ikp camp can
be seen nround on tho hills, and dou
In tho valleys, tented cities of pyra
mid tents all the same sl7o and col
or and In tho morning and ovenlm;
can bo heard the trumpet calls from
all sides.
Thore nro lii.OOO troops hqiwd In
tho U. S. government tents at No
gales. One organization, the Connec
ticut troops, have n complete band
with them and every evening wn
are favored with a concert. As far aj
can be ascertained ,he says, MoMcaiw
aro a scarco article, they having Itod
far into tho interior of Mexico.
On tho wny down to tin- present
destination, many of thot boys purch
ased melons and fruits ami as 'a re
sult they buffered from cramps' and
other minor kidney troubles, rA't the
writing of this letter, Mr. Hatch says
all tho men are In fine fettlo and ov
en tho most pessimistic feel that
Arizona Is a good place to go for a
vacation. Life' on tho border Is some
what after thai of California, only
It Is a trlfio hotter, 125 degrees in tho
shade. "
It rains every day, and It rains, not
Bprlukles. Tho men In each tent are
taking prldo In making tholr tent at-
' tractive by planting cactus and beau
tiful palms. Century plants grow vriH
all over tho hills. The men are all
1 In fine health and but fow arc home
sick. Tho commander has provided
1 splendid shower baths and sanitary
rules aro strictly enforced and a
good many men aro cleaner now than
they ever were beforo.
