Ft. Thomas July, -i, Pros
pect of many weeks in tlio Ft.
Thomas mobilization camp yawn
ahead of the Kentucky guards
men if a report that the various
units will bo hdd here until re
cruited up to peace strength is
true. An army officer stationed
at the camp voiced the opinion
to-day that no unit will bo allow
ed to leavo nnlil the required
number of men has been enlist
ed. Tho officer would not say
positively tho Department of tho
East has mado known its inten
tion in regard to this question,
but ho spoke positively to the ef
fect that "many more men will
liavo to be in line" before the
Kentucky troops leavo for the
Mexican border.
Ho also said separate units
would bo ordered to the border
as soon as thoy have tho neces
sary number of men and snid he
believed the Signal Corps, which
practically is ready in every way
for field servico will entrain
within ten days. Tho Third
Regiment also is only a fow men
below peace strength and pola
bly will leavo in advancn of any
other regiment The First and
Second Regiments ueed more
than 200 men each and indication
aro the recruiting squads that i r
going out into the State will not
liavo much luck in the way of
securing recruits.
No word has been received as
yet by A-ljt. Qen. Ellis author
izing him to send tho recruiting
officers ont. As tho time of de
parture for the border hinges on
the recruiting question a great
doal of fretting is going ou in
tho camp because of the delay.

EARLINGTON
TO HAVE A
CHAUTAUQUA
The Date Has Been Set For
August 12-14-15 191)
The people of this community
should rejoice in the fact that this
summer we are to have a Chautauqua
of our own. Many of our citizens
have during previous summers at
tended Chautauquas in the larger
cities neaiby and they are very en
thusiastic over the realization that
this year they can enjoy the same
kind of a program without going
away from home.
The local committee which was in
strumental in bringing the Chautau
qua to Earlington this year assures us
that the program will be of the same
high character as that provided for
the larger Chautauquas, the only dif
ference being in the length of the
program.
The movement was started some
time ago when a representative if
the Welfare Chautauqua visited our
town and presented the proposition
to a number of our public spirited
citizens. The opportunity presented
for affording the people of the com
munity a chance to enjoy the splen
did lectures and musical entertain
ment was one that could not be ov
erlooked and our business and pro
fessional men were practically unani
mous in deciding at once to put Earl
ington on the map whh other enter
prising towns that provide whole
some and inspiring entertainment of
this kind for their citizens.
All arrangements have been made
to assure the event being a success in
every way and every man, worn n
and child in the community shonld
give the movement the support it de
serves by talking it to friends, buy
ing a season ticket and attending all
of the six sessions.
The following local committees
have been organized to carry out the
details of the management.

The Chantauqua will be held in a
large tent, located on the school
grounds, furnished by the Chautau
qua management. The platform,
seats and piano will be provided by
our local committees.
The program itself is a most inter
esting one. Space will not permit
giving details regarding it in this is
sue, but it can be stated in a general
way that there will be six inspira
tional and instructive lectures supple
mented by six musical concerts and
other entertainment of the highest
order.
The programs and other advertis
ing material has been received by the
Committee on Publicity and the
posters, banners, etc., are now being
put up in conspicuous places.
In next issue of this paper we will
describe the various interesting fea
ture of the program in more detail.

spirit by doing everything in your

Prize for the cleanest rifle at the
Inspection of Small Arms today was
won by "Shoddy" O'Connors, which
was two extra prunes for breakfast.
Shoddy is justly proud of this dis
tinction. Recently a party of the boys walk

came to attention, and stood with

Don't offer any of them beef in the
near future.
It was reported upon good author
ity that one of Co. G's. men saw a
biscuit the other day. He was
promptly called to headquarters and
questioned regarding the report.
Some people call Kentucky the
"corn cracker" state, which was all
right years ago.bnt times have chang
ed and so has corn bread, at least
you can't get a definite idea of what
corn bread looks like, from Fort
Thomas soldiers.
Recently a letter came to the Fort
addressed to Richard Hawkins Co
G. 3rd Regt. Upon examination it
was found no man of this name be
longed to the company, consequently
it was passed to the Rev. J. S, Haw
kins, of Earlington, who opened it in
the presence of 1st Sergt Brinkley but
it wasn't for the Reverend. It began
with: "Dear Darling Richard" and
ended with lots of Hugs and Kisses,
that looked like a picket fence. The
Rev. is "some soldier" alright.
It's hard to tell who's the sickest,

The boys in camp are awful blue
