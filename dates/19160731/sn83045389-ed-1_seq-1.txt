communication issued this evening.
Gains also were made by the French 1

"In the region of Ohnulnes we dis- |
persed an cnomy reconnaissance to tho

were repulsed. A bombardment con
tinued throughout the region of Fleury,
Vaux and the Fumin wood.
"The night was calm on the rest
of the front.
"Yesterday our machines engaged in
eleven lights on the Somme front.
Three German machines were brought
down and a fourth machine, attacked
l>y one. of our aeroplanes, was dashed
' to pieces within the German lines on
the Argon no. It is continued that one
of tho German machines previously
reported as having been seriously dam

| Already In the hands of the British
foreign Office, the note declares "In
j the gravest terms" that It Is "manifest- j
ly out of the question that the govern
ment of the United States should nc
quiesco in such mchods." and that the
' nited States regards the bhwk list
as "inevitably and essentially incon
sistent with the rights ..f all the citi

In attempting to v. i?h the people

tions now at war, subject only to well
defined international practices and un
derstandings which the government of

ment of Oreat Britain to have too
j lightly and frequently disregarded."
The American note is even more posl.
tive in its terms than officials.have
Intimated. Ambassador Page was in
structed by Acting Secretary Polk to
deliver it formally and textuallv. it
follows:
"The announcement that His Britan
nic Majesty's government has placed I
the names of certain persons, firms,1
and corporations In the United States!
?iprtn h prescriptive -blnck list' and has'
forbidden all financial or commercial
dealings between them and citizens of
'.roat Britain has been received with
the most painful surprise by the peo
ple and government of the United
States, and seems to the government
of the United States to embody a policy
of arbitrary interference with neu
tral trade against which it is its duty '
to protest in the most decided terms.
SI'OI'K AMI KKKECT

"The scope and effect of the policy
are extraordinary. British steamship 1
companies will not accept cargoes'
from the proscribed firms or persons. '
or transport their goods to any port,,
and steamship line* under neutral
ownership understand that if they ac
cept freight from them they are likely!
to be denied coal at British ports and
excluded from other privileges which
they have usually enjoyed, and may!
themselves be put upon the black list.
Neutral bankers refuse loans to those
on the list and neutral merchants de-:
cllne to contract for their goods, fear- j
Ing n like proscription. It appears that '
British officials regard the prohibl- !
tions of tho black list as applicable
to domestic commercial transactions
in foreign countries as well as In i
Oreat Britain and her dependencies, 1
for Americans doing business In for- j
eign countries have been put on notice j
that their dealings with blacklisted ,
firms arc to be regarded as subject to '
veto by the British government. By j
the same principle Americans in the ;
United States might be made subject]
to similar punitive action if they wer?!
found dealing with any of their own '
/countrymen whose names had thus !
been listed.
"The harsh and even disastrous ef- !
fects of this policy upon tho trade of.
the United States and upon the neu-j
tral rights upon which it will not fail '
to insist are obvious. Upon the list '
of those proscribed and in effect sliur
out'from the general commerce of the'
world may be found American con-!
corns which are engaged in large com- j
merclal operations as importers of for- j
clcrn products and materials and as
distributors of American products and i
manufactures to foreign countries and
which constitute important channels'
through which American trade reaches
the outside world. Their foreign affil
iations may have been fostered for
many years, and when once broken
cannot easily or promptly be re-estah- j
lished. oilier concerns may l?o' put!
upon the list at any time and without!
notice. It is understood that additions'
to the proscription may he made 'when- '
ever on account of enemy nationality or
enemy association of such persons or!
bodies of persons it appears lo IBs j

American citizens from such measures,

to information given out by Mexican

General Carranza will enter the field

which intimated that the. first chief
would soak elevation to the presi

The conference of Mexican generals
with Carranza soon to be held in Mexi
co Ciiy, according to these advices, will
arrange for the retirement of the first
chief. This conference was said to
have been summoned to prevent pos
sible friction in military circles over
the proposed transfer of power.
While no date has been set for the
conference, .several lil^ii officers of

holding of a national election.
Such a retirement it is expi-cted,
would be merely nominal and would

It was learned to-day that when the

ternoon the Apache's commander was
asked by officials who are looking af
ter the submarine's interests if he
could convoy the Deutschlaml to the
three-mile liiiiit off the capes. The
officials were referred to the Navy
Department. To-day the Apache's
commander said he had received no
orders to convoy the submarine and
had no official Interest in her. The
tugs Britannia and Chicago came up
to the IVutschland's pier to-day, and
the nrltannia's captain had a confer

NEW YORK. July 30.?Property loss
estimated at $25,000,000 was caused
early to-day by a series nf terrific ex
plosions of ammunition awaiting ship
ment. to the entente allies and stored
on Black Tom Island, a small strip of
land jutting into New Vork Bay off
Jersey r'lty. The loss of life still was
problematical to-night. It will not be
determined definitely until a check is
made of the workmen employed on the
island and of boats moored near-by.
Three are known dead, and nt least
five more are missing. Scores of per
sons were injured, some of them prob
ably mortally.
The detonations, which were felt In
live States, began with the blowing
up of great quantities of dynamite,
trinitrotoluene and other high explo
sives. followed by the bursting of thou
sands of shrapnel shells, which literal
ly showered the surrounding watera
for miles around.
Pi re that started soon after tho ?
great crash has spread death and deso
lation In its wake, destroying thirteen
huge warehouses of the National Stor
ape Company, in which was stored
merchandise valued at about $12,000,
000. The flames, shooting into the
clouds, were reflected against New
^ ork's "sky line" of toworing offico
buildings, which only a few momenta
before were shaken to their founda

Miles of streets in Manhattan wore

Early reports of heavy loss of lifo
were Impossible of verification, and
the authorities asserted the number of

was said that, owing to the extent of
the wreckage, it might be several days
before the exact figures could bo ob

Tho cause of tho disaster had not
been determined to-night. Officials of
tho. National Storago Company and the
Lehigh Valley Railway, which also suf
fered heavily through loss of property,
declared, however, that reports to them
showed a fire started shortly after 1
o'clock this morning on a barge be
longing to an independent towing com
pany that had been moored alongside
a dock used by the railroad company
to transfer ammunition shipments from
trains to vessels In the harbor.
The barge, it was said, was there
without authority either of the rail
road or the storage company. The of
tii'i.ils refused to disclose the nanio
of the independent towing company,
saying they were investigating "to

had been set on fire as the result of
