JERSEY CITY, July 31. I was jarred from my bed by
a titanic burst on Sunday morning. Mv first thought was an
earthquake. Thousands fled to the streets in their nightclothes
and remained until dawn, expecting the buildings to collapse,
i he lights went out. Many clocks and watches stopped. Doors
crashed inward, roofs ripped off, brick chimnevs fell and light
ning flashed hundreds of feet skyward. Flames shot to the ze
nith. Roosters began crowing, ambulances began passing fire
engines hurried past. Suddenly the entire world seemed split
open. My ear drums were almost broken. A pillar of flame
shot skyward. A huge smoke ring twenty feet in diameter
whirled above. It formed a mushroom shape. Then came an
other crash. A door fell inward. The earth seemed to drop
away. 1 felt a sensation like suddenly dropping fifteen floors
in an elevator. There were whistling, whirring sounds over
head. Shrapnel buzzed around. I lay face downward. A
bombardment started from the harbor. There were continu
ous heavy explosions and many smaller ones. The nurses were
not exciU'd and attended the wounded as the policemen carried
them from the houses. When day came the ground for miles
around resembled a war correspondent's descriptions of ruined
fortresses. Twisted steel bars weighing fifteen pounds were
found three miles from the scene.
There were many freakish inci- soldier' sheepskin overcoats rained
