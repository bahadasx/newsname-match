it plain that under no circumstances
will the United States submit to the
creation of "an exparte blacklist."
The protest, while giving Fngland
the benefit of the doubt, in suggest
ing that the blacklist was created
"without a full realization of the
many ur desired and undesirable re
sults that might ensue," makes it
plain that the friendly relations be
tween the two governments are en
dangered by the act of the British
foreign ottice.
Another point emphasized in the
protest, and one which is expected
to become a factor in all of the re
lations between the United States
and the various belligerents, is that
citizens of the United States are en
tirely within their rights in attempt
ing to trade with belligerent nations

It was said in official circles today

reply, suggested by the Rritish am

completed ind would not be extend
ed, will not be satisfactory to this
government. That is alt right as far
as it goes, but the demand of the
