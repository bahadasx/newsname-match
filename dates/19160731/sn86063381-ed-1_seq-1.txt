HOLDS VISITORS
Sunday's Game One-sided ajid Unin
teresting Score is 11
tol.
Bemidji came out with the small
end of the score in two games with
the fast Hibbing team Saturday and
Sunday, losing the Saturday game by
a score of 3 to 2 and being swamped
in the Sunday game by a score of 11
to 2.
The contest Saturday wjs a real
baseball game. "Smoky" Sam White,
Bemidji's Indian pitcher, held the vis
itors to six scattered hits, while his
team mates got nine safe blows. Er
rors and poor base running in the
fifth inning lost a chance to tie the
score and a possible chance to win.
Neither side scored in the first in
ning. In the second Fautsch reached
first on an error and Williams, the
next man up, slammed the ball over
the fence for a home run Bemidji
scored one in this frame on two hits
and an error.
Three on Bases.
In the third inning the visitors an
nexed one more counter on two hits
and a sacrifice. In the fifth inning
E. Bailey and Boudreau got on, each
getting a hit. Diedrich was given a
base on balls, filling the bases with
only one man out. Boudreau was
caught off second and forced E Bailey
at home. Whaling scored Boudreau
with a safe hit. Frank was passed
purposely and Withers struck White
out, retiring the side. Neither side
scored after the fifth inning.
Sunday's game jpra* one-sided and
uninteresting, the visitors getting 17
Bits, seven- betng for extra bases,-for
a total of 11 runs, including a home
run by Fautsch. Wilson, the Hib
bing twirler, was only in trouble once
that being in the third inning when
he walked three men and allowed two
hits. Bemidji scored its two lone
tallies in this frame. did not al
low a hit after the fifth inning.
"Pegging" it Feature.
One bright feature of the game
from a Bemidji standpoint was the
"pegging" of Frank to second base.
Two of the visitors tried out his arm
and he got both of them.
Three of the extra base bits made
by the visitors were the longest hits
made here this season, the ball going
over the railroad tracks.
The fielding of Tanner and Boud
reau was one of the features of the
series, the former making a sensa
tional running catch in the Saturday
game. i

Washington, July 31.The text of
the American note protesting against
the British blacklist of American
firms, was made public today. Its
terms are more positive than previ
ously reported.
The note in part says:
"It seems to the government of the
United States to embody a policy of
arbitrary confidence with neutral
trade-against, it is its duty to pro
test i a most decided terms. By the
same principles Americans might be
made a subject of a similar punitive
action if they were found dealing
with any of their countrymen whose
names had thus been listed.
Effects Disastrous.
"The harsh and even disastrous ef
fects of this policy upon trade of the
United States and upon neutral rights
upon which it will not fail to insist,
are obvious. The government of the
United States begs leave to remind
the government of his majesty that
the citizens of the United States are
entirely within their rights in at
tempting to trade with the people of
the governments of any of the nations
now at war The subject is only too
well defined by international prac
tices and understandings which the
government of the United States
deems the government of Great Brit
ain to have too lightly and too fre
quently disregarded. Th government
of the United States cannot consent
to see these remedies and penalties (for
breaches of blockade) altered or el
tended at the will of a single power
or any group of powers to the injury
of its citizens or the derogation of
its own rights."

ORIGIN OF BLAZE IS NOT
KNOWN INVESTIGATION ON
Shock is Felt in Five States New
York Skyscrapers Rock as if
in Earthquake.
(By United Press)
New York, July 31.A score of
persons were killed, many were in-
jured and property to the extent of
$25,000,000 was destroyed when five
carloads of munitions for the allies,
stored in the Lehigh Valley yards at
Tom Point, N. J., exploded early Sun-w
day morning
Cause Hot Known.
Mystery today still beclouded the
real cause of the explosion. Whether
it started on a large loaded with nitrq
cellulouse or ignition of four freight
cars loaded with high explosives, no
one knew
At eight o'clock this morning the
flames were still soaring from the
wreckage of railway cars, shrapnel
and other shells buried deep in the
rums, occasionally exploding
Seventeen warehouses, six piers,
four barges, one tug boat and 85
freight cars, many loaded with muni
tions, were destroyed
Greatest Explosions.
The explosions were the greatest
in the history of New York city and
an official investigation has been be
gun The shock of the explosion was
felt in five states. New York sky
scrapers were shaken as if there was
an earthquake Windows were brok
en for miles around. All the win
dows in the Statue of Liberty weraC
broken.
Fire destroyed he 13 great ware
houses of the National Storage com-"
pany on Black Tom Island where, mer
chandise was stored, worth ?12,-
000,000.
Hit Ellis Island.
The first big shock was felt in five
different states along the coast. Shell
laden barges belonging to the Nation
al Storage company drifted down the
bay ablaze and hit Ellis Island, doing
over a million dollars worth of dam
age Th immigrants were hustled
from the island to safety. Two cars
of shrapnel were surrounded by flames
and the fire fighters were helpless to
rescue them.
Fire Stars in Barge.
The fire started at 1:05 Sunday
morning in a barge belonging to an
independent towing company which
had been moored alongside the rail
road company's docks, expressly
against orders, according to one re
port. M. T. Henley, night general
yardmaster of the New York division
of the Lehigh Valley road, was on the
pier when the fire started. says
that an explosion, which occurred at
2:08, was on the same barge on which
he first noticed the fire.
Attempt to Move Cars.
Henley's first thought was to re
move the loaded cars from the dan
ger zone, he says. When he reached
the end of the pier the barge was
burning fiercely and the flames were
beginning to spread to some cars
nearest the barge. Two long trains
of cars were successfully removed
from the danger zone.
Damage Not Determined.
Damaged goods are continually be
ing discovered and the amount of loss
in dollars and cents is not yet known.
Four thousand tons of raw sugar
valued approximately at 93,400,000
is one of the known losses, but it ia
believed that the other contents of
the several warehouses will greatly
increase this amount.
No explosives were stored in the
warehouses, but in only two of the
cars which were totally destroyed.
These were loaded with shrapnel
which would be in any source of dan
ger, but for outside fire. Th other
cars destroyed were principally load
ed with salt and borax. Th scene of
the explosion and fire is in no way ad
jacent to the main passenger station,
or freight terminals at either New
York or Jersey Cityr Th excitement
in no way interfered with the opera
tion of business. i
