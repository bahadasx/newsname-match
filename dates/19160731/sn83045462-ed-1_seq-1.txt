to have been moored at the p.er.
/rank' Hague, commissioner of pub.
safety of Jersey City, charged that
t..e blame of the explosion lay with
either the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company.

them had violated the laws of New Jersey,
the Jersy City ordinances and the

Several Investigations Begun.
Several investigations were commenced

the fire which caused the awful explosion
that destroyed $5,000,000 worth
of ammunition, eighty-five freight cam,
set blazing ammunition barges adrift

ONCE AGAIN SEEKS PROHIBITION
IN D. C.
Senator Jones Gives Notice He
Will Introduce Amendment
to Appropriation Bill.
VICE PRESIDENT'S RULING
OPENS WAY. HE ASSERTS
Action Regarding Works Amend-1
ment Gives Rise to Hopes of Senators
Sheppard and Vardaman.
Declaring that the ruling of
the Vice President on the Works
amendment doing away with the
District of Columbia as such and
making the District government
a bureau of the federal government
opened wide the door to all
kinds of legislation upon the District
appropriation bill. Senator j
Jones of Washington today gave !
notice in the Senate that an i
amendment for prohibition in the j
District would be offered.
Senator Sheppard of Texas arose and j
confirmed this statement of Senator J
Jones.
Senator Jones admitted he feared that
if an appeal were taken from the rulings
of the Vice President, holding the
Works amendment in order, the ruling
would be overturned by the Senate. |
"However, if the ruling stands," he i
said, "prohibition will go irt the District '
bill, or it will have to be defeated by a j
reversal of the reasoning which led 1
, the Vice President to rule the Works j
j amendment in order.
1 I
What Ruling Was in Effect.
"I am not sure myself but that the |
ruling of the Vice President is'correct.
He ruled In effect that the District of !
Columbia is strictly an agency of the
federal government to carry out the
provisions of the Constitution and th
legislation and not general legislation,
legislation.
Under such a ruling the rule of the
Senate providing that general legislation
shall not be attached to general ;
, appropriation bills would not be effective
as regards District appropria!
rion bills and prohibition for the Disj
trict would be merely special legisla- ;
i tion.
"I am satisfied that the Senate will hold
; the ruling of the Vice President wrong,
! however. Personally, I will not oppose I
: the taking of an appeal."
Senator Vardaman of Mississippi interrupted
:
"I want to express the hope that the j
Senate will not overrule the Vice President,"
he said. "He rendered a very 1m- !
portant decision in my opinion, when he t1
ruled on the Works amendment, and I jsaw
in it an opportunity to enact much 1
salutary legislation for the District of
Columbia and the people of the United ]
States." J
Works Amendment Comes Up.
When the Senate today resumed con- 1
sideration of the District appropriation
bill the pending question was the adoption
of the Works amendment to abolish
the District of Columbia and the halfand-half
plan, and to have the government
pay all the expenses of the District,
the citizens of the District to continue
to pay a reasonable tax. This
amendment was ruled In order by the
Vice President Friday, although it was
challenged as being general legislation
on an appropriation bill. Efforts are
being made to have an appeal taken
from the ruling of the chair, and if
such a course is taken it is likely that
I the ruling will be overturned by the 1
; Senate.
The supporters of prohibition In the
I Senate today expressed the opinion
there was little likelihood that an
amendment providing for prohibition ,
! in the District could be added to the
: District bill, since they believed such
j an amendment would be ruled to be
I general legislation, and so not in order
I on an appropriation bill. Much will
I depend, however, upon future developments
in the consideration of the District
bill, as to the course which will
be adopted by the prohibitionists.
The District bill, which automatically
came before the Senate at noon, was ;
temporarily laid aside to permit Senator
Owen to get action on his bill <
an ending the federal reserve act.
Newlands Urges His Amendment. !
Notwithstanding the fact that the 1
! Works amendment was pending before <
the Senate, Senator Newlands of Nevada
took occasion to urge upon the
Senate the adoption of an amendment ,
proposed by him providing for a board
! of army engineer officers to work in
I conjunction with the fine arts commission
to develop a plan for the com- !
men ial development of the water front ]
of Washington with a view to retaining
scenic beauty. He offered his 1
amendment in connection with an ap- 1
propriation of $60,000 for completing j 1
! the new fish market. Senator New- j
| lands' amendment would have $10,000 j
appropriated for the use of this board, j I
Senator Newlands made a. strong plea ; ,
for the development of water front in ;
Washington along lines which would '
safeguard the artistic and beautiful, j '
He pointed out how much had been I <
done along this line by foreign countries
and mentioned the development ,
l of the Seine at Paris, the Thames at j ,
i London, arid of the Rhine at various ,
German cities. ,
"Should Develop Water Fronts."
It is of the highest importance that j
| some attention be given the develop
: merit or water rronts commercially
along artistic lines In this country,"
said Senator Newlands. "This is a
matter which has been almost entirely
neglected in America in the past."
Senator Newlands said that there was
no purpose in his proposed amendment to
prevent the erection of the central power
plant for government buildings at the
foot of 14th street, against which he has
waged a steady tight in the past. He
said that the amendment of his would
merely insure that this power plant, if
constructed, should be constructed with
a view to the artistic development of the
water front.
Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire
suggested that Senator Newlands was a ;
little late with his amendment, since the ,
congress has appropriated for a new fish
wharf and a new fish market on the water 1
front and the plans have already been !
prepared tqr these structures.
Senator Martin of Virginia said that !
he was in sympathy with Senator New- 1
lands' VUnm tfcftt the water front of the
I
.
ff *

capital should be beautified and developed !
with a view to the artistic.
Sterling Offers Tax Amendment.
Senator Sterling today offered an
amendment to the District bill providing
that a tax of one-half of 1 per cent
should be paid on intangible personal
property by persons and corporations
in the District of Columbia. The amendment
proposed is as follows:
"That the moneys and credits, including ;
moneys loaned and invested, bonds and I
shares of stock except the shares of i
banks and other corporations within
the District of Columbia, the taxation
of which is herein provided for, of any
person, firm, association or corporation
within said district shall be scheduled
and appraised in the manner provided
by paragraph 1 of said section 6 for
listing and appraisal of tangible personal
property, and assessed at their
fair cash value, and as taxes on said
moneys and credits there shall be paid
to the tax collector of the District onehalf
of 1 per centum of the value
thereof.
This amendment Is intended to reach !
property of persons of wealth in the
District who now are not taxed upon
el considerable portion of their wealth.
Criticises President Wilson
for Reappointing Gen. Smith
on the District Excise Board '
1
Senator Jones of Washington today in 1
the Senate vigorosly criticised President
Wilson for reappointing Gen. Robert G. 1
Smith and Mr. Henry S. Baker members |
of the board after a Senate committee had
reported the board as permitting evasions
and pervasions of the exercise law. The
Senate has rejected the renomination of
Gen. Smith, and President Wilson has ^
since appointed Andrew J. Cummings
in his place; but the President reappointed
Mr. Baker a member of the
board, and Mr. Baker's nomination is
being fought in the Senate.
Senator Jones described in detail the
activities of the board when both Gen.
Smith and Mr. Baker were members,
and pointed out alleged evasions of the
law in the interests of the saloon, as
described in the report of the special
Senate committee. He told the Senate
the President had reappointed Gen.
Smith notwithstanding this report, that
he had written to Senator Sheppard of
Texas that he was "much concerned"
over the matter, and that in spite of
the rejection of Smith nomination
by the Senate, the President had-sent
in the reappointment of Mr. Baker
July 14
Should Have Bead Report.
"I do not know whether the President
had read the investigating committee's
report when he reappointed Mr. Baker,"
said Senator Jones. "He said that he
had not read it when he reappointed
Gen. Smith. When Gen. Smith's nomination
was rejected I think he should
have examined that report and testimony
most carefully.
"By his action the President again
denounced the report of the Senate
eommittee as false; he Indicated again
his approval of the nullification and
perversion of the law passed in behalf
of temperance, morality and good government
in the District of Columbia |
and directly rebuked the Senate for
Its action in rejecting Gen. Smith." i
Continuing, Senator Jones said: "On c
the 1st day of July, l&lfi, the term
of office of Henry S. Baker expired.
He was one of the original appointees c
to the excise board. From the begin- i
ning he approved and assisted in the ^
perversion of the law by the board,
and showed by his action an utter dis- a
regard for its provision, and an abject
subservience to the liquor interest.
"The excise law of the District was J,
not enacted in the interest of the liquor
traffic. It was enacted to promote tern- a
perance, morality and good citizenship. s
Certain definite restrictions were placed
by the law upon the power of the J
board to secure these purposes, and a
wide discretion was left in it, which !
was hoped, believed and expected 1
would be used in the interest of the 0
people and not in the interest of the
saloon. a
Favors to the Saloon. a
"The board resolved every doubtful a
provision of the law in favor of the c
saloon; it has exercised its discretion h
always in favor of the saloon, and It t
has directly nullified, disregarded and f
perverted the plain provisions of the
law in the interest of the saloon. Rob- 3

TORONTO. Ont., July 31.?A
message received by the department
of mines and forests states
that the fires in northern Ontario
have been entirely quenched
by heavy rains. All fires are out.
ENGLEHART, Ont., July 31.?
Forest fires raging in northern
Dntario are believed to have resulted
in the loss of not less than
?00 lives. Scores of persons have
ieen injured, and it is feared
nany ot tnem may aie.
The known dead are: At Nushka,
57; Cochrane, 18; Matheson, 34; Iroquois
Falls, 15, and Ramore,'15, a total
of 139. It is learned that there has
been loss of life also at Porcupine
lunction, where only the railroad station
escaped the flames. Outlying
places are expected to swell the list
materially when rescue patries return.
Iroquois Falls, where great paper
mills are located, was not entirely
turned, as reported last night. Advices
today state that the paper mills and
nne store were saved from the flames.
Nushka, Matheson and Ramore were
intirely burned over and Cochrane
nearly so. Houses on two of its small
tvenues were saved.
The death list will be materially in:reased,
it is feared, by victims in
utlying districts. There are apparmtly
well authenticated reports that
nany prospectors have been trapped
it Tashota and Kowash. One farmer
nd his ten children are known to have
>een burned, while the man's wife was
rainly seeking aid to check the onushing
flames.
Walls of Fire Cut Off Escape.
Nushka, a hamlet consiting of a score
>f frame buildings and stores, suffered j
vorst. It had been threatened for sevral
days, but the residents lingered
n the hope they might save their |
lomes. They waited too long, however,
nd walls of fire cut off escape.
A nearby lake In which they found
efuge saved many residents of Cochane
on the line of the Temiskaming
.nd Northern Ontario railway. Only two
treets in the town were saved.
Thirty-four bodies are lying on the
llatform of the railroad station at

The flames were checked at Timmons
.fter seventeen houses had been burnd.
Only the sawmill was destroyed

Northern Ontario railway adopted energetic
relief measures. Calls for assistance
were sent to towns along: the line
and a fully supplied relief train was
sent out.
Hundreds of square miles of bush and
farm land have been burned over. Isolated
settlers took refugre in lakes and
rivers, leaving: all their belongings behind.
Rain was falling last night at Matheson
and several other points, but a
long-continued downpour will be necessary
to extinguish the fires and prevent
them from sweeping farther
southward.
Coffin-Laden Train Blocked.
COBALT, Ontario, July 31.?A relief
train, with physicians and nurses and
a large quantity of supplies, caught*
fire several times on the way to the
scene of the disaster last night and
finally was halted north of Englehart
when the flames extended to the long
trestle bridge over Blanche river. Two
cars attached to the train were filled
with coffins.
Extent of the Fire Area.
TORONTO, Ontario, July 31.?G. Howard
Ferguson, minister of lands, forests
and mines, asserted last night
that as near as he had been able to
| learn, the fire area reaches from
Matheson to Cochrane and as far west
as Hearst.
"About sixty bodies were taken out
of Matheson. twenty-seven at Muskoka
and about twelve at Cochrane," he said.
"No doubt there is a very considerable
loss of life yet to be accounted for. The
bridge at Wetabeg is burned, so that
we were unable to get beyond there
today. We have two trains north of
there, but we do not know what has
become of them. We expect to repair
the bridge so that we will be able to
get over tomorrow some time. We are
sending provisions, blankets and tents,
secured from the militia department."
Commissioner Leo of the Temiskaming
and Northern Ontario railroad estimated
that the number of dead in the
fire would reach 147.
Works Commissioner Harris and
Property Commissioner Chisholm of
Toronto based an estimate of 143 on
messages received from various points.
EXPLOSION INQUIRY STARTS.
Officials Seek to Learn if Any Federal
Laws Were Violated.
Investigations of the great explosion
in New York harbor to learn if it were
the result of violation of federal law
were begun today by the Department
of Justice and the interstate commerce
commission, through their agents in
New York.
The inquiries first will be informal
and designed only to determine if
either department has Jurisdiction in
the case. If It develops that either
regulations of commerce or the neutrality
laws have been violated, the
government then will begin extended
investigation into the facts leading up

PETROGRAD, July 31, via
London, 3:36>p.m.?In the region
of Brodv, on the Volhynian and
Galician frontier, Russian troops 1
are pursuing the Austro-German
armies, it was officially announced (
here today, and have reached the
Rivers Graberki and Sereth.
Official Russian Statement.
The text of the Russian official statement
says:
"In the region northeast and southeast
of Baranovichi a fierce artillery a
duel is taking- place. ^
"Enemy aeroplanes dropped bombs
on the stations at Zamire and Isiaslay. *
"On the River Stokhod our forces c
fighting there went forward. At one
of the bends in this river in the course I
of our attack we have taken with y
other prisoners the entire 31st Honved
Regiment, with the regimental commander
and his entire staff. S
"At other places on the Stokhod we r
took twenty-one officers and 914 rank
and file and four machine guns. In f
the direction of Kovel fierce fighting
continues. [
"In the Brody area we are pursuing
the enemy and have reached the Rivera <j
Graberki and Sereth."
New Russian Development.
While Gen. Brussiloff's breach in the
Austro-German lines west of Lutsk is F
being- widened and deepened by the t
further driving home of the wedge be- s
tween the armies of Gen. von Linsingen ^
and Gen. von Boehn>-Ermoll, a new
development is recorded in the renewed a
activity of Gen. Letchitzky to the south t
of the Dniester. The Russians here 0
have begun a new turning movement
on Von Bothmer's right flank to the p
west and southwest of Tarnopol. The
operations in (his section, which were n
brought to a halt a fortnight ago by ?
freshets, have been renewed in the direction
of Stanislau. a division of Cau- n
casian cavalry having rushed the Austrianfe
and captured Ezerzany, twenty
miles southeast of Stanislau. d
At the same time new blows have
been delivered on the north extremity
of the Lutsk breach, just south of the ^
Kovel-Samy railroad at Gulevitchi and c
Svidniki. where the Rovno-Kovel railway
crosses the Stokhod. The latter
cenler has been the most fiercely con- il
tesbed portion of the Kovel defense. 5
Czar's Forces Cross Stokhod. r
d
The fact that the Russians have been {
able to throw bridges across the Stok- ^
hod here and at Gulevitchi and establish
a foothold on the west bank of the
river is taken by military experts in
Petrograd to signify a definite weak- g
ening of the German opposition and n
the tightening of the circle around c
Kovel.
Gen. Sakharoff's drive In the direc- ^
tion of Vladimir-Volynski and Sokal p
continues with unabated vigor. His w
enormous captures of prisoners, total- fs
ing in eight days nearly 40.000, are con- f<
sidered significant of the demoraliza- d
tion of the forces under von BoehmErmolli.
v
Col. Shumsky, military critic of the t:
Bourse Gazette, points out that the b
capture of two generals and two regi- S
mental commanders is an indication of fi
the extreme depth of the penetration of g
the Austro-German lines, as such officers
customarily are a considerable \

Ives further proof of the perfection
f the new method by making: a clean
weep of the German positions along: a
hree and a half mile front from Hardcourt
to the river. The French troops

iritish carried ou.t the operation asigned
to them. That having been satjfactorily
completed the central echejn
received word to move forward
gainst the German trenches on the
astern slopes of the ravine through
hich a light railroad runs from Comics
tO'Clery and Peronne.
Every detail of the advance had been
orked out with mathematical precision
eforehand, and the operation was comleted
well within the time limit set. The
stacking troops met with a more than
?ual amount of resistance from the Gertans,
who had foreseen the move and
id made every preparation In their power
? frustrate it. The positions had been
rengthened as well as the incessant rain
' projectiles from the French artillery

ere gathered in the rear.
The German reserves were hurled forard

and the fighting was last and furiis,
especially at the southern end of the

the counter attacking troops to adince
with some prospect of getting
