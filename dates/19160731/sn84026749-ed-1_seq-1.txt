CARRANZA MAY
REJECT U. S. PLAN
State Department Reports Say He
Objects to Additions.
Disturbing reports have come to the
Btate Department that Carranza will re.
ject the additions made In Washington
to his suggestions In the note of July 21
for settlement of border troubles by a
commission.
Strong apprehension was felt today
that a serious slip may ensue In the
negotiations between the two govern
ments. The Mexican peace discussions
are at a standstill pending receipt of
Cnrranxa's official reply.
Carranza submitted three propositions
for consideration by a Joint commis
sion. All related to military move
ments across the border. If reports
now coming from Mexico City are re
liable. Carranza will continue to In
sist the commission parleys be con
fined' to discussion of three subjects
he suggested withdrawal of Ameri
can troops, a protocol governing re
ciprocal crossing of the border by
military forces of both nations, and
responsibility for past border raids.
Officials admitted today that Car
ranza played shrewd diplomacy in
framing his suggestion for a border
conference. All three proposals, It
was pointed out, get back to the same
thing withdrawal of troops.

District Militia Will March to
White Lot for Parade at 5
o'clock.
All arrangements were coniplHcd nt
the mobilization camp today for the
parade and review of tho Third Regi
ment, District Militia, on the White
Lot at S o'clock this afternoon.
Headed by tho band and Col. Glondle
B. Young, the reKlnivnt composed of
about 900 men, will leave the camp near
Fort Myer shortly after o'clock.
This will allow one hour for a leis
urely march down the military road
and across tho Highway bridge, nnd put
the regiment on tho Whlto Lot by tho
time Government employes and thou
sands of others who are expected to
reach the parade ground arrive.
The regiment will be put through a
dress parade similar to those ltncert
at the annual encumpnientx of the na
tional guard, and following the field
maneuvers there will be a review by
Colonel Young.
The demonstration Is expected to last
about half an hour. Tho soldiers w II
return to the mobilization camp for their
evening mall nfter marching up Seven
teenth street, emit on Pennsylvania ave
nue to Fourteenth and thonco bnck to
camp by way of the Highway bridge.
Rivalry Among Men.
It Is expected by tho officers of the
Third Regiment that tho soldierly ap
pearance of tho militiamen and the
snapplness of their drill win prove n
revelation to tho people of Washing
ton as to how much military training
can accomplish In five weeks.
There Ib keen rivalry among the
companies over making a pood Impres
sion and all commands will bo en their
mettlo.
Colonel Young said today ho believed
the appearance of the regiment on the
White Lot would not only allay all tho
fears of members of the families of the
Suardsmen over the treatment tho sol
lers are receiving In the camp, but will
also stir up considerable enthusiasm
for recruiting.
Six escort wagons from tho supply
company, drawn by army mules, will
accompany the Third Regiment to tho
White Lot. Two of these wagons will
carry the tents and blankot rolls as
well as a day's rations for Companies
It and M of the Third Regiment.
These two companies will not go bek
to camp nfter the parade, but will go
to the rifle range at Congress Heights
for practice.

of these companies has almost eighty

No stigma should be attached to Col.

because of the raid on Columbus, which
precipitated the present Mexican trou

Unreliable Information as to Villa's
whereabouts, "unfortunately credited,"

surprise nttack, tho report said.
Slocum. nccordlng to the report, made
every effort to find whero Villa was
and what his Intentions were.
"Tho Information tecelved from the
usual Mexican sources was unfor
tunately credited," the report com
mented, "when as a matter of course

ters information as to Villa. It was
said, was such ns to cause "no par

Blocum and his men were commend
ed for their defense of Columbus and
their repulse of the bandits In Persh
ing's section of the ropoft.
Funston's theory, according to the
Vvar Department report, was that
Villa waited for a patrol to pass, and
slipped through. lie said the cavalry
could not cross tho border and had
to patrol great distances.
"A partial surprise, carried out by
stealth and treachery In tlmo of
Geoce," Funston continued, "must not
e judged by the same standards as
a surprlso In time of war."
Ho added that had there been a
war on, Villa could not have got his
men so closo to the line,
Scott, concluding his recommenda
tion, thought Slocum and his men
ought to be "highly commended for
their prompt and valorous action in
tho repulse of Villa's force and In
pursuit of same."

M. Dickman, Lehigh Valley agent,
and Alexander Davidson, superin

Judges Mark A. Sullivan and '
George Tennant today, charged
with manslaughter in connection
with the Black Tom explosion yes
terday. Their cases were postponed un
til Friday morning at 10 o'clock, at
the request of Prosecutor Robert
Hudspeth.
The defendants were released
under $5,000 bail.
Theodore B. Johnson, president
of the Johnson Lighterage Com
pany, for whose arrest a warrant
has been issued, did not appear.
Johnson and Davidson are charg
ed with negligence in permitting
a tug to tie a barge loaded with
dangerous explosives to the. pier.
Dickman is charged with permit
ting box cars loaded with high ex
plosives to be placed on a railroad
siding in a position where danger
from fire or explosion was great.
The three men are specifically
charged with causing the deaths of
Capt. Cornelius Leyden, of the Le

the victims of the explosion.
AGENTS ON SCENE.
Agents from the Justice Department
and the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion spent nearly all day on the seen.
On their report will depend whether
tho commission will go mora rully Into
the case. This phase, however, will not
deter utate and Jersey city omcuxa la
their Investigations and prosecution.
Most amusing of all the startling fea
tures of this greatest explosion on rec
ord, la the growing belief this afternoon
that the death list will not exceed 36 or
30 at the outside.
As the flames died out this afternoon
and searchers prepared to go through
the ruins of the Lehigh docks, only four
persons were known to have died.
They were Conrad Leyden, the Lehigh
Valley's chief of police ; Arthur Tossen.
baby, shocked to death, and two uni
dentified men.
Twenty-three men are reported miss
ing. These are the known facts as to loss
of life more than thirty-six hours after
tne tlrst explosion.
A serious aftermath of the disaster de
veloped today when many boxes of dy
namite and other high explosives wet
discovered floating nearly suomergM. in
the harbor. Marine officials Issued warn
ings to shipowners, and established a
harbor patrol of small boats.
U.S. DECIDES TO TAKE
NO ACTION IN PROBE
Biclaski Denies Taking Part in
Jersey Investigation.
State authorities alone are endeav
oring to fathom the cause of tha gi
gantic explosion which yesterday
morning struck terror Into the hearts
of residents of New York and sur
rounding communities and destroyed
millions of dollars' worth of property
bordering on the harbor of the me
tropolis. Tho Federal Government Is merely
"sitting on the side lines." as an
official expressed It, and will take no
part In the procedlngs unless the State
discloses that outside agencies were
responsible for the explosion.
A. Bruce Blelaski. chief of the Di
reau of Investigations of the Depart
ment of Justice, this morning dented
emphatically that his office was car
rying on the Investigation, and said
that he had had only a verbal report
from the Now York branch of his
service. This report, he added, repre
sented the explosion as accidental!
It was explained today that the Inter
state Comrnoice Commission can novo
no official Inteieat in the explosion ex
cept to determine whether the explosive
were properly packed.
If the explosion was due to Improper
packing, In violation of the regulations
of tho commission regarding the labeling
and packing of all dangerous explosives
then the commission would have the au

dence collected over to the Department
of Justice
