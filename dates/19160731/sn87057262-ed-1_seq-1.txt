NEW YORK. July 81.—Mystery
early today still beclouded the real
cause of the explosion and Are which
early Sunday morning occurred on
Black Tom island. Vtethcr a Are.
starting on tb« Iwige loaded with
nitrocellulose or Ignition of four
freight cars loaded with high exploe
Ives, was the cause, no one eoald tall
today. -c
Perhaps the exact cane* never wRl
be known.
The condition ofth* am of devaa

that hoar shrapnel and thraa Inch
sheila burled deep In the ruins were
being ignited occasionally by tha heat,
vtfto a desultory pop-pop that kept
workmen and crowds of spectators at
Tcapeetful distaaces.
Dead, missing and Injured- lists ad
mittedly were mere estimates up to
noon today. The very nature and
tent of the blast.and lira made topoa
Bible, this early, anything lfta definite
compilation of life loss. .Only a visit
to the scene can make on* realise
how difficult it will be aren after sev
eral days of aearch of ruins and tee
ords to tell the exact loss,
|is Up to 8 o'clock, only two known
dead wfere marked down. Twenty
five others Are missing and
j4the
lie
are
known to have been Injured. Thfs
listv In Injured doesn't lnclnd* those
hart miles away from the scene by
falling glass."
Four separate investigations start
ed tdttay by the railroad companies,
Jersey City authorities, the state and
the federal government. Agents of
each were on the' scene and will re
main until they, go into every phase
of the case.
Estimates of the property damage
run all' the way from $20,000,000 to
f50.000,000. The concensus of opin-
er correct after complete tabulation
had been made of thousands upon
thousands of Shattered windows and
other similar damage done la Jersey
City, Brooklyn, (Manhattan and a
dozen surrounding torn, dtles and
.hamlets.
This one item of smashed glass
"alone incidentally has been estimated
at more than a million and a quarter
^dollars.
Only the facta that, the two major
explosions occurred at the hour thev
did-2:08 and 2:35 a. m.—and where
they did, undoubtedly "presented far
kreater loss of life and vastly more
property damage. Black Tom la sit

Impact of that blast that made itaelf

Buildings shivered like a giant ship

waa Jarred from windows, like water

lllEht several roosters nearby began
crowing.
1 telephoned the United Press In
New York and ten minutes later was
aft near the scene as I 'oduld get. Soon
after that, ambulances came carry
ing calm looking, white capped nurses
and policeman. Then came the fire
apparatus. Suddenly the entire world
•seined to ajplit open. 1 didn't realy
hear anything- My ear-drums merely
seemed to collapse. A -pillar of flame
slut skyward. Upward and surround
ing the fire column rolled a circlet of
peculiar colored smoke twenty feet
in diameter. iAs It touched the top
of the flame, it umbrellaed Out until
it formed a mushroom shape and
then came another-crash of sound.
A door just .behind me fell inward.
I ffelt a sens&Uoo, much magnified,
Ion'among Jersey City oillclals was' as one gets when an elevator dips
that the latter figure would be near- suddenly ten or fifteen stories.
Then, came a whistling and whirring
overhead. It was shrapnel and 1
ducked to lie face downward until the
worst of it seemed to stop. It later
developed this bombardment came
train shrapnel and shell loaded
^freight
cars some distance frbm the''end of
the peninsula.
By this time there were countless
pat-pat-pat, bang, smash, explosions
from out in the harbor. Explosives
on careening barges were letting go.
The nurses, least excited of anyr
one about, methodically went about
recelviiv & number, of injured the
policemen were bringing out.
When day came, the ground for
miles about reminded me of descrip
tions the war correspondents nave
given of shell-pierced earth about a
fort. The only difference was ap
pearance here and there of great
pieces of heat colored steel, some ten
to fifteen pounds in weight, looking
like some Hercules had twisted the
ends in opposite directions. Several
such bai* were found two or three
miles ®way from the peninsula.

BALTIMORE?, Md., July 31."—Official
and unofficial spies were scattered
down the Patapsco today by the Ger
mans to protect the sub-sea freighter
Deutschland against the suspected
machinations of the British.
This counter-moveCnent was taken
in view of the United States' govern
ment refusal to convoy the submarine
to the Capes.
The fact that one of the allied
watch ships had disappeared from
the harbor without cargo.only served
to heighten the fear of the Germans.
Promoters feared she will lurk
down the bay to ram the submarine.
Hints that the Deutschland might
be rammed "accidentally" have be
come facts to th^ pverwrought Ger-
mans.

MHROEDBS, Texaa, July 31.—Men
belong to European armies in order to
fight for their countries.
After seeing these amies and
oomlng to see the American armies oa
the Rio Grande, the question arises,
"why have American men joined the
militia?"
This question asked, hit or miss, in
an automobile tour of the lower Rio
Grande valley yesterday, brought
these answers:
Capt. Elmer McDevltt, of Duluth,
Co. A, Third Minnesota, all-Ameri
can guard from Yale in 1913:
"When the European war began, I
realized that American young men
didn't know anything about fighting,
and I felt it was my duty to learn."
8. G. White, of Dallas, artificer.
Second Texas:
"My father and brother were mur
dered by Mexicans and I Joined to
fight."
A. X. Nofel, of Minneapolis, private,
Cohmpany I, Sdcond Minnesota, for
mer rug merchant of Syria:
"I went to the University of Min
nesota for an education, but whpn I
found military training was compul
sory In the university I made up my
mind I might as well Join the militia
and get a full military training."
Colonel Robert McCormick, of Chi
cago:
"After seeing the war in Europe, I
decided that Americans ought to learn
how to protect themselves."
A. W. Dahle, bugler. Co. D., First
Minnesota:
"I learned to be a bugler in the
boy scouts and when the trouble
with Mexico arose, I Joined the mili
tia to go into Mexico."
Captain G. A. N. Anderson of Far
go, Co. B, First North Dakota:
"Four years ago there was a little
scare In Mexico over the Madero
troubles, and after reading the papers
one evening I decided we would
have trouble with Mexico, so I went
down to the armory before bed time
and enlisted."
R. H. Slmme, of Falrbault, sergeant
major,- Second Minnesota:
"I alwaya wanted to go to a gym
nasium and there wasn't any Y. M. C.
A. in our town so they built an ar
mory with a gym. I joined the
militia."
Captain Glen Latter, of Washing
ton, Iowa, Troop A, First Iowa cav
alry:
"My grandfather was killed In the
war of 1812, and my father and five
uncles were in the civil war. My
brother was in the Spanish war and
I joined because it was my turn."
Lieut. Forest Lee Lowery, of Dal
las. Co. B, Second Texas:
"My two grandfathers fought on
the confederate side, one under Forest
and one under Lee. I was named for
those two generals. My folks fought
|n every American war up to the pres
ent time and I want to fight in this
one—if there is going to be one."
Col. W. I. T. Mollison of Falrbault,
Second Minn.:
"My father was in the union army
in the charge at Gettysburg with the
First Minnesota and when I was six
teen years old he took me by the
nape of the neck, led me to the mili
tary recruiting office and made me
join. It was purely compulsory and
the o-peration frightened me because
the captain lifted me off my feet so
my head would touch the height bar,
as I was too short."
