XEW YOHK. July 31. Comprehen
sive investigation into the shipment
end of the munitions business of the
country by state and federal authori
ties seemed certain this afterncon as
a direct result of the munitions ex
plosion that occurred at the Black
Tom munition terminal Sunday
A sweeping investigation came to
day when Prosecutin-g Attorney Hud
steph at the preliminary hearing of
the two men arrested en charges of
manslaughter in connection in the re
sultant deaths declared every railroad
terminating in New Jersey has been
a flagrant violator of the statutes reg
ulating storage of high explosives.
Agents for the Department of Jus
tice and the Interstate Commerce
Commission spent nearly all day on
the scene. On their report will de
pend whether the commission will go
more fully into the case. This phase,
however, will not deter state and Jer
sey City officials in their investiga
tion and prosecution.
The .growing belief this afternoon
that the death list will not exceed
twenty-five or thirty at the outside.
After the flames died out this after
noon and searchers prepared to go
through the ruin of the Lehigh dock,
enly four persons were known to have
died. Twenty-three men are reported
missing. These were the known facts
as to loss of life more than thirty
six hours after the first explosion.
A furious aftermath of the disaster
developed today when many boxes of
dynamite and other high explosives
were discovered floating nearly sub
merged in the harbor. Marine of
ficials issued warnings to ship-owners
and established a harbor patrol of
twelve boats.
ARE YOU HOT?
THEX DON'T
Eat too much, and avoid heat mak
ing foods.
Eat winter meats.
Forget that this is the time to cat
the things that are growing now.
Eat a heavy meal just before going
to bed.
Drink ice cold drinks.
Drink any beverage containing al
cohol; they all produce heat.
Wear any winter clothing.
Wear anything but thin underwear
and our lightest outer garments.
Sleep indoors if you can possibly
aioid it.
Fail to rise early to enjoy the cool
est part of the day.
Forget that this is the season to
get all the fresh air you possibly
can.
Bathe in cold water or in hot wa
ter; tepid water is best.
Forget that many so-called drown
ings are really heart failures due to
the shock of the cold water.
Lose your temper.

Libertj Statue Little Damaged.
Ity Fulled Press.
XEW YOHK. July 31. Miss Liber
ty's gown was torn a little and some
of her skin punctured by shrapnel,
but tho famous statue on Bedloe Is
land today was found to be surprising
ly free from injury, considering Its
location less than a mile from the
Black Tom peninsular. Many freakish
incidents were reported here and else
where. The main door .giving en
trance to the Statue of Liberty was
wrenched off its hinges as by a giant
hand; doors were crushed in and prob
ably a hundred bolts joining the plates
which compose the grant figure were
broken or sheared off. A number of
iron bars were twisted. It was some
caprice of the exploding force that
left the giant figure almost untouched.

WANTS WORLD TRADE
U. S. Makes Move for Ex
pansion in Blacklist Note
to England.
Ity I'nlted l'ress.
WASHINGTON', July 31. The blow
launched against the British blacklist
in the American note published today
is but the first act of an aggressive
moe for this country's share in the
world trade now and after the war,
officials intimated today.
Government officials are interested
to sec in the blacklist the Allies'
preliminary step in a trade war
against Germany, which was clearly
outlined at the economic conference
at Paris some weeks ago. The neces
sity of keeping clear of both the war
and "after the war," and of showing
England that the United States as a
neutral nation will not particitate in
nor allow herself to become the vic
tim of any such move is understood
to have been the underlying reason
for the American blacklist protest.

It is the thermometer that makes

teacher. If so, the extent to which
you feel the heat depends somewhat
upon which one of these heat indi
cators you consult. Out of five ther
mometers in Columbia, only two reg
istered the same today.
At 10 o'clock this morning the
thermometer at Rummans' Lunch
Room registered 93 degrees, at 12
it stood at 98 and at 2 o'clock at 100.
The one at the Xew York Store reg
istered the same. At Matthews Hard
ware store the thermometer stood at
93. 97 and 100 degrees at these three
hours; at the same time the one at
the Columbia Drug Company regis

again yesterday afternoon and staged
another coirieback. defeating Boon
ville 10 to 5. The last game with
Boonville, played there on July 16,
was won by Boonville by a score of 8
to 6. The game yesterday was fea
tured by brilliant stick work at sev
eral stages of the play and by the
clever baserunning of Foster, who had
three stolen bases chalked up to his
credit.
Caldwell started out in the box, but
was relieved in the fifth inning by
Manager Taylor, who held the visitors
hitlcss until the ninth, when Boon
ville added another hit and run to its
score. The slugging of Rutledge also
looked like the big league variety
when he poled one home-run and one
two-bagger out of three times up.
