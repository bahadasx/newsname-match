Road to Rim of
Crater Lake Open
The road to the rim of Crater Lake
was opened up to automobiles last
week and dozens of cars make the
trip to the rim dally. The road was
cut through the huge drifts In places.
This Is the latest for a number of
years that the snow has held back
the autoes from the rim.
Never have the roads been as good
to the park as they are now. All the
way from Medford they are as hard
and smooth as a floor. The late rains
have benefited them. Since then the
highway ' has been scraped and
dragged, removing every rut and
rough spot. The 81 miles is a trip
of continual delight and pleasure.
The Prospect grade was never better.
The portion that was soft and loose
last year, because of new work done,
Is firm Through the Crater Lake
national forest, beyond Prospect, the I
road Is like a city boulevard.

Ascends Ashland
Butte Backwards
Milton Biegel achieved a unique
feat Sunday when he accomplished
the ascent of Mt. Ashland backwards.
He walked backwards all the way
from the postofflce to the summit,
consuming a little over six hours in
the trip. The distance is about four
teen miles. He was accompanied by
his two brothers, who walked "right
side ahead." Last year Milton rode
and pushed his bicycle to the summit
and rode back down In less than two
hours. Young Biegel is an all-around
athlete and won the marathon race
held in the city two years ago.
Artillerymen
Back From Fort
The first company, Coast Artillery
Corps, returned yesterday evening
from the annual encampment at Fort for single dances,
Stevens, and report the ten days to
have been full of bard work and good
times. Several of the militiamen
stopped off In Portland and at other
points to visit before coming on
home. The men were given separate
return transportation for this pur
pose. The boys made good records
In every department at camp and
gained much valuable experience.
. phone news items to Vhe Tiding
Owing to the fact that two or three
members of the Ashland band have
been obliged to leave town because of
lack of employment or better oppor
tunity elsewhere, and others for varl
ous reasons, the band is now hiring
five men from out of town, who come
up for the concerts Wednesday even
ing and Sunday afternoon. The band
is steadily getting better and now
ranks as a very high-class organiza
tion for a city the size of Ashland
The instrumentation is very evenly
balanced, and of course the out-of-
town men brought in are the pick of
the valley players. The band now is
composed of twenty-four pieces. Ow
ing to the unforeseen strain resulting
upon the band's finances from the
necessary hiring of outside talent,
the band finds it difficult to make
ends meet from the amount sub
scribed by the citizens. However,
this is being done. The band has
needed and must have a double B
bass horn, also a new bass drum,
The bass section of the Ashland band
will equal the best anywhere In the
valley if such a horn can be procured,
and the boys are determined to go
after it. The drum is a necessity, the
old one being all in. Rather than
ask for further subscription the band
is to give a benefit dance, the man
agement of the Bungalow having do
nated the floor. On next Thursday
evening, therefore, everyone who
dances and enjoys dancing to a big
five-piece orchestra of the city's best
musicians should come up to the Bun
galow, help out a worthy cause and
enjoy a very pleasant evening. The
band men have been wholeheartedly
giving their time for practice and
concerts twice weekly this summer,
and the citizens owe it to them to
give their dance the biggest kind of
patronage.
Dancing will be 50 cents for the
entire evening or 10 cents a dance
Anyone who does
not get several times 60 cents' worth
of fun out of the evening should see
a doctor. Everybody is invited and.
urged to come and bring their
friends.
Archie Eubanks and Meredith
Beaver returned Friday from a three
weeks' outing, during which they
spent a week at Lake of the Woods, a
week -at Jennie creek and another
week on the road, making the trip
by way of Pelican Bay and Klamath
Falls. At Lake of the Woods there
are few campers, most of the camp
ers going to that favorite spot dur
ing huckleberry season when they
can combine huckleberry pies with
the other delights. Archie reports
catching a two-pound rainbow by
trolling In Lake of the Woods, and
states that they caught several nice
trout there and that by next year
the trout fishing should be great.
The trout were planted in the lake
several years ago. but seemed to have
a hard time getting started, due to
the number of carp In the lake. The
carp are an awful bother yet, accord'
ing to the boys, taking the spoon like
trout.
Lake of the Woods is the prettiest
camping place in the west, and excel
lent trout fishing will make it a para
dise for campers. The boys state
that a man is going to have several
boats built and for hire on the lake
by next year. There Is only one at
present.
The road to Lake of the Woods Is
almost impassable for automobiles at
present, according tio the boys, the
high centers, stumps and rocks being
a constant danger. Automobiles can
easily go within six miles of the lake,
however, and one car came clear in
while they were there. It will take
but little work to put the road In
shape for autoa. The road on to
Pelican bay is in worse shape and
will require much more work.

Boxing Match Was
Feature of Camp
According to the returning boys,
one of the most Interesting occur
rences of the Coast Artillery annual
encampment at Fort Stevens this
year was a boxing bout held at the
skating rink between Burney Bur
nett of the first company of Ashland
and Murray Scott of the Fort Stevens
regulars.
Six rounds were scheduled, but af
ter Burnett had the best of it in
three of the six the referee had them
go one more round, which resulted
in a draw, the same as most of the
rounds which were not decisively
Burnett's. The decision was a draw.
The first round was a draw.
The second round was Scott's by a
shade.
The third round Burnett had Scott
groggy throughout the whole round
The fourth round Burnett knocked
Scott, te his hands and knees during
the first part of the round and had
him -groggy during the rest of the
round.
The fifth was Scott's by a small
margin.
The sixth and seventh rounds were
even.
"Burney" shows only one black
"lamp," while his opponent displays
two, and It is needless to say that
the first company Is proud of the fis
tic ability of their genial comrade
and his showing against a regular
who had opportunities to train for
this bout which Burney could not in
dulge in. Such condition can be
maintained only through constant
care.
Roundup Men Plan
For Next Year
The Roundup Association met
Thursday evening of last week and
listened to a report of the recent
roundup, both financial and detail.
The invoice of the assets which the
old association Is turning over to the
newly formed corporation were gone
over. PlanB for the coming year
were discussed and laid and enthusi
astically received.
Another meeting will be held to
morrow evening and the organization
perfected. Seventy-five shares of
stock were subscribed Tuesday. The
association Is over-subscribed and
some of those who have four shares
have been asked to let loose of part
of them. The aim is to Ret as manv
men as possible interested in the
roundup, thus putting the backing of
the greater number behind it.

Wade Hampton Wins
From Bessie Mills
Mystery Woman
Case Hushed Up
All the mystery of the "woman of
the Siskiyous" has been eliminated
Yreka, Cal., authorities at the head
of the posse searching for her found
her a few hours after she was dis
covered in the Quigley cabin on
Dutch creek. The facts as given out
were correct, but for the sake of her
self and her family her name and the
man in the case were hushed up
This Information was given out by
the police Friday. She was taken
from the cabin on horseback.
It will be remembered that the
woman was discovered In the lonely
cabin by a wandering prospector. He
gave her what aid he could, and when
he went to a settlement for food, six
miles away, she disappeared. Sheriff
Howard of Yreka and a posse of fifty
men rushed to the scene and after a
twenty-four-hour search quietly re
turned to their homes. Since then
the California authorities have been
reticent to talk.
A Quiet Mining
Deal Pulled Off
Before a crowd of a thousand yell
ing racing fans, Wade Hampton, old
veteran racing horse, (romped in two
lengths ahead of Bessie Mills, fast
little Medford mare, at the Medford
track Sunday. After a half hour of
jockeying the mounts got off to an
even start, and Wade forged ahead
almost from the first Jump.. J. J,
Arant, who owned Wrade and rode
him in many a hard-fought race, rode
the old timer against Bessie Mills and
caused the wise ones to sit up and
take notice of the manner in which
he handled the big horse. Medford
was pretty well cleaned out after the
race. Jinks Murphy brought back
Doc Helms' hat, betting his own
headgear after his money was gone
against the sombrero of the Medford
believer in the unbeatable qualities of
Beslse Mills. Jim Bowers, owner of!
Wade, will go over to Dorrls next
Sunday and may make arrangements
to match Wade against some of the
fact northern California horses for
two or three weeks from Sunday.
General Passenger Agent Batters
of the state of California and other
California Southern Pacific officials

city tomorrow by Agent Kramer and
Mr. Greer. Mr. Batters holds the

M. Scott holds in Oregon. 1
Ten Thousand Will
Sing of Ashland
Need Lithia Trough
For Deer Visitors
Prof. Henry G. Gilmore has re
ceived the proof for his song, "Ash
land the Beautiful," which is being
published by the Southern Pacific
Company at their San Francisco
printing plant. The make-up of the
piece of music Is very attractive. A
glass of water with a bubbling spring
adorns the cover, with the title done
in artistic lettering. On the back is
a brief delineation of what "Oregon's
Famous Spa" has to offer the tour
ist, together with directions for
reaching Crater Lake and Josephine
Caves from Ashland and descriptions
of these wonders. The piece of mu
sic is strikingly, attractive and will
attract attention anywhere.
The song, both w rd and music
of which are from the pen of Prof.
Gilmore, is a beautiful thing, and af
ter Its introduction to the people of
Ashland will soon become the popj
lar air of the day, so catchy is the
tune. It is dedicated to John M.
Scott, who Is an old friend of Prof.
Gilmore. Mrs. O. Winter's motto,
"Ashland Grows While Lithia
Flows," is on the cover, properly
credited.
Ten thousand copies of the song
are to be printed immediately for
distribution throughout the east, and
later ten thousand more for the Pa
cific coast territory. This advertis
ing is something unique and distinct
ive and is very valuable. Ashland
owes a great big debt to Prof. Gil
more, who donated his composition
to the cause, and to the Southern
Pacific for publishing and distribut
ing it.
The song will be arranged for a
quartet by Prof. Gilmore and sung at
some public gathering in the near fu
ture. It is also hoped that it may be
arranged for a chorus and sung by
the choral club.
