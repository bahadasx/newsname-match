Body. Will Convene at Nine
o'CIock Tuesday Morning
to Investigate Explosion at
Golden Drift Plant
The grand Jury has been called to
convene at the court houso at nine
o'clock Tuesday morning for the ape
clflo purpose ot probing Into the ac
cident that wrecked the machinery
at the Golden Drift dam early Fri
day morning. The mystery continue
to deepen, and puhllo sentiment li
-divided as to the cause of the burst
tng of the big pulley. The officers
are determined that If dynamite waa
need every possible effort to appre
hend end bring the guilty parties to
Justice shall be made. Wltfa this tn
view, the district attorney talked
"with Judge Calkins, and It was de
cided that the grand Jury should be
called In special aesalon to thorough
ly Investigate the affair. If dyna
mite waa used. It Is believed that It
can be demonstrated. There are
some, however, who contend that the
machinery may hare gained greater
momentum than Mr. Davti believed,
and that the pulley threw Itself to
pieces with ehoiigh force to splinter
the heavy timbers and rip the bjg belt
Into pieces. The contenders for the,
dynamite theory point to the cord
with Its chaired end, picked up t
the scene, the rocks that lsy by the
wrecked machinery and that had not
been there previously, and the terrlflc
force exerted both upward and down
ward by the explosion. There, are
also parties who maintain that the
explosion was plainly beard by them
at Grants Pass, a distance of nearly
three miles.
The grand Jury Is composed of J.
A. Slover, foreman; C. II. Klmann,
A. L. Edgerton. Geo. M. Flint. T. It.
Cornell, Jan. W. Dean, and V. C.
Ablf.
An order for a belt to replace the
one rulnod In the explosion Is being
wired today, and the extra pulley at
the plant will be Installed and made
ready for operation as soon as work
men can do the necessary labor. It
Is believed that the pump can thus
be again started by Thursday. The
-agar beets under the Fruttdale. ditch
are not suffering materially for water
yet, and are making an excellent
.growth. If water can bo flowing
through the ditches by the end of the
week the crop will not be shortened.
The north aide pumps will be running
again by tomorrow.

Washington, July 31. The blow
launched against the British blacklist
In the American note published today
Is but the first act ot an aggressive
move for this country's share In
world trade, now and after the war,
officials Intimated today.
Government officials aro Inclined
to see In the blaokllst the allies' pre
liminary step In a trade war against
Germany which was clearly outlined
at the economic conference at Paris
some weeks ago. The necessity of
keeping elear of "the war after the
war" and of showing England that
the United States, as a neutral, will
not participate In. nor allow herself
to become victim of, any such move,
Is understood to have been one under
lying reason for the American black
list protest.
The far-reaching effect ot the Brit
ish blacklist upon neutral trade and
the feeling that the trade war to fol
low military ipeace may contain, even
more serious consequences to neutral
nations, determined the administra
tion to enter a vigorous protost
against the principle Involved. It
waa feared the United States might
be considered committed to the allies'
trade policy through keeping silent.
It Is for tbls reason that England's
preliminary reply to the protest,
given the state department Saturday!
'is unsatisfactory to the government,
'in It the British foreign office took up
'only the question of Immediate ap
plication and extent ot the blacklist.

New York, July 81. Mystery ear

of the explosion and fire which early
Sunday morning occurred on Black
Tom Island. Whether a fire, start

the cause, no one could tell today.

Bandit Raiders Are Engaged
by Soldiers of the Eighth
U.S. Cavalry, and Two,
With Five Raiders, Are Killed
El Paso, July 31. Two Americans
were killed in a clash between a de
tachment of troop F, Eighth U. S.
cavalry, and ft party of Mexican ban
dits at the Sanches ranch, one and
a half miles below Fort Hancock,
Texas, at 5:30 a. m. today.
Five of the Mexicans, nearly half
of the band, were killed In the run
ning fight that followed the bandits'
resistance to arrest.
Three troops of cavalry ordered
from Fort Bliss to purine the escaped
bandits' were afterward ordered held
back. Pursuit of the bandits across
the line Into Mexico was contemplated
for a time.
Robert 'Wood, a customs inspector,
with the cavalry patrol, waa one ot
the first to be killed tn (he engage
ment. Private John J. Twomey also
was killed . and Sergeant , Louts
Thompson waa wounded. The ac
curacy of the American cavalry took
a heavy toll among the bandits and
pursuit waa abandoned after the re
maining Mexicans disappeared In the
'bruah. ' " "
Captain H. B. Cashing, of the
Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, made
an official report ot the fight to Gen
eral Bell at Fort diss. ' Cushtng Is
snklng officer In the Fort Hancock
cipated In the clash.
"We believe the plot was aimed at
the Unlte Railways division ot the
preparedness parade, and that the
bomb was timed tor 2 o'clock, when
that division was due to ' pass.
Mooney, Welnburg and Kohn waited
on the sidewalk outside while Bil
lings and Mrs. Mooney went upstairs
with a suit case. We believe that as
two o'clock neared they feared the
bomb might have been mis-timed, or
that the United Railways division
would not pass on time. They hur
ried towards where the United Rail
ways' men were lined up, we believe.
That they did not reach there was
due to the way in which the police
handled the crowd. We believe the
persons Involved took a chance, put
down the suit case and fled."

he declares, was a prominent figure

hundred and eighty-tour lives have so
far been reported lost in the greatest
forest fire northern Ontario ever has
suffered.
More than two million dollars
property damage has been done.
The fire district forms a strip of
territory shaped like the letter J, with
Bourkes forming the end ot the case;
Cochran the Junction with the cross
bar, and Hearst and Iroquois at either
end.
The fire broke out at four o'clock
on Saturday afternoon and was re
ported simultaneously at several
points forming a semi-circle from
Bourkes to Hearts, over a hundred
mile frontage. 1
Driven by a 40-mlle an hour wind
from the south, the flames rolled over
the countryside Just like a heavy
thunder storm coming up ahead ot a
hurricane, and with everything as dry
as tinder there- was never a chance
for people to save anything.
The villages of Bourkes, Ramore,
Matheson, Mushka, Monteith, Kelso,

wiped off the map, the flames consum
