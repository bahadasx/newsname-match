(By Associated Proas.)
NEW YORK, July 31.?Two men
are under arrest today on warrants
charging them with manslaughter in
indirectly causing the death of ono
of the victims of the terrific explos
ion of ammunition on Muck Tom pier
early yesterday morning.
Estimates of tho casualties early to
day placed the number of dead at four
with three others mortally injured.
25 suffering from less serious injur
ies and eleven to twenty missing.
Those under arrest uro Albert M.
Dickman, agent of the Lehigh Valley
railroad, stationed at Black Tom pier,
and Alexander Davidson, superintend
ent of the warehouses of the Nation
al Storage company, thirteen of which
were destroyed by the Are which fol
.lowed tho explosion.
A warrant was issued for tho arrest
of Theodore E. Johnson, president of
a lightering company one of which
barges loaded with ammunition is al
leged to have been moored at tho pier.
At least, $10,000,000, perhaps. $15.
,'000,000 loss fcaused by tho destruction
of 13 of the 18 warehouses of the Na
tional Storage company in Jersey City.
Edmund L. Mackensie' stated today.
This loss is amply coverod by Insur
ance.
, r "It would be mere guess work to es
timate the damago now," Mr. Macken
?rie said, "but It was at least $10,000,
00 very likely1 much more.
f' "The damaged goods included 30,
000 tons of raw sugar valued at be
tween $3,000,000 and $4,000,000 and
24,000 bales of tobacco."
On consignments of munitions and
other supplies going to France the
loss will fall on insurance companies
owing to tho fact that a policy to the
French government covers shipments
from the beginning of the trip until
delivery.
English shipments are insured only
"in water side" in New York while In
the case of shipments to Russia poli
cies aro written both ways.
Stories told by those who narrowly
escaped death verge on the miracul
ous. One man says he was blown off
sa lighter into the bay and swam to
Bedloe's island but had a swim back
again to tho Jersey shoro when the
Flaming barges bombarded tho island.
. "The air seemed to bo full of flames
and I thought tho end of the world
had come." said another survivor.
A third was blown fifty feet from the
top of a freight car and landed near
a building which fell on him.
Tho detonations, which wero felt
in five states, began with a continu
ous rapid fire of small shells, then the
blowing up of groat quantities of dyn
? amite, trlnitrotolueno and other high
explosives, followed by the feurst
fetog of thousands of shrapnel shell
?which literally showered the surround
; ing country and waters for manys
miles around.
The flames, shooting Into the coulds,
were reflected against New York's
j&'sky line" of towering office buildings
?which only a few moments before were
shaken to their foundations by the
earthquake. Miles of streets in Man
hattan alone were strewn with brok
en glass and shattered signs.
The cause of tho diseaster had not
been determined Officials of the Na
tional Storage company and the Le
hlgh Valley railroad, which also suffer
- ed heavily through loss of property,
declared, however, that reports to
them showed a fire started shortly
Pafter 1 oclock Sunday morning on a
barge belonging to an independent
Jtowing company that had been morred
|alongsido a dock used by the railroad
company to transfer ammunition ship
ments from trains to vessols in the
lharbor.
The barge, it was said, was thore
! without authority either of the rail
glpad or of the storage company. The
: officials refused to disclose the name
; of the independent towing company,
i saying they were investigating "to
[ascertain whether the barge purposo
lly had been set on Are as the result
Of the plot."
Every window in the pedestal of
ithe statute of Liberty, on Bedloe's
j Island, opposite Black'Tom, was blown
^>ft its hinges.i The statue itself, how
was not damaged, except from
he rain of shrapnel which bespatter
I Although the plant which furnish
; ed power for Badloe's Island was shak
*wd partly put out of commission,
the famous "light of liberty," burned
steadily throghout tho hours of con
fusion, flaming high above tho pall of
smoke.
Early reports of damage to fho
buildings on Kills Island were exag
gerated, acordlng to Captain A. 13.
Fry, supervising engineer of federal
building of New York. Captain Fry
said tho Iohb could not exceed $50,000.
Most of the damage nt the Immigra
tion station was caused by tho forco
of the explosion, which wrecked walks
and buildings and shattered windows
and doorways. Two barges ablaze
and lnden with slmpnel shells had
drifted to the Island from tho scene
of the disaster. A municipal flre boat
and tug played streams of water on
them from one side ad Ellis Island
employes from the other. An explos
ion on one of the bargest damaged tho
structure housing tho power plant.
Two other lire-swept barges ground
ed on tho southwest corner of tho
island, which contains the contagious
disease hospital. Tho medical staff
removed the 450 inmmlgrants on the
island to the battery.
Many small craft, as well as several
good-sized steamers and sailing ves
sels, wero badly damaged. Crews on
tho big ocean liners anchored out In
the harbor, or docked along tho New
.Torsoy and New York water fronts,
declared that when the first two great
explosions occurred It appeared as if
their vessels were literally picked up
out of the water and hurled hack.

a far reaching effect on the presiden
tial campaign. Hughes is to bo noti

convention which nominated him of
his nomination, and he is expected to
survive the shock of surprise by de
claring himself of some S000 words
which his supporters confidently be
lieve will cause the national adminis
tration a lot of trouble trying to make
the public forget.
Thero is a delegation of hefty West

can state committee, accordlug to rec
ommendations adopted Saturday night

tion purposes. For the approvul of the

ization was selected:
Chairman?T. J. Sherrard, of Wells
burg.
Vice-chairman and Secretary?;
Grant P. Hall, of Charleston.
Treasurer?Dave Gideon, of Hunt-1
ington. I
As members of an advisory commit-,
tco to work in conjunction with the of

to be presented for ratification to the
whole commlttee^al a meeting to be
held in Huntington, on the evening of
August 9, preceding the slate judicial
convention to be held on August

The selection of Mr. Shorrard is un
derstood to meet with general approv
al. Mr. Sherrard is one of the best
known Republicans in the state and
is a leading business man in the north
ern Panhandle, being one of the heads
of tho George rnd Sherrard Paper
Manufacturing Co.. of Wellsburg. Ho
has just finished one term as stato
chairman in which he won unstinted
praise by the vigor and ability with
which ho conducted the duties of his
position. Much of the Republican suc

Mr. Sherrard was elected a member of
lho state committee in 1912, without
opposition from the First senatorial
district, and in the recent primary
again was elected without opposition.

by other business. The candidates
spent several hours in discussiug their
choice for chairman of t4io state com
mittee, and they ended by recommend
ing Mr. Sherrard to the sub-commit
tee.
Mr. Sherrard came to Parkersburg
with tho firm intention of not being a
candidate to- the chairmanship be
cause of the time it takes from his
business affairs, but when the deci
sion of the candidato was made
known, he said that he was willing
to do any work he is called upon to do
for the Republican party. Mr. Hall
was proposed for chairman at the se

CONSTRUCTION
OF FAIRMONT
HOTEL BEGINS
Large Force of Men Went
to Work This Morn
ing.
DIRT GOESTO SOUTH IE
Superintendent Beaumont
Will Open Offices Near
the Job.
With a large force of men and seven
or oight teams the work of excavation
on the site of the new Fairmont hotel
was begun this morning. Sam Polino
received the contract for the excava
tion and Is working on a yardago ba
sis. Sam is reported to be paying his
men $2.75 per day.
This morning no men reported for
work on the south side bridge that is
being repaired by the city, and the la
borers arc now In the employ of Sara.
The reason for this sudden shift is ev
ident as the city has only been paying
$2 per day. The work on the bridge
will be resumed as soon as moro men
can be found that arc willing to work
for $2 per day.
The dirt taken from the hotel exca
vation is being hauled to the south
side where It is dumped into the ra
vine where the street ought to bo be
tween Fourth and Third streets on
Virginia avenue. It is thought that
almost enough dirt will be obtained to
make possible the grading through of
this streot.
Superintendent Beaumont of the G.
A. Fuller company in charge oif the
construction work 0f the new hotel an
nounced today thaU4iQ would open of
fices immediately and arrange for
soon as the excavation is sufficiently
under way. Tho stone and concrete
work will be given to local contractors.
The building directly back of tho
hotel formerly occupied by a tin shop
has been secured from C. D. Robinson
and will be used for the ofTIces of the
construction company.
I.VA. GUARDS NOT
Forces of But Three States
Are in That Class as
Yet
ispec. Dispatch to West Virginian)
WASHINGTON. D. C\, July 31.?
Precisely what status they occupied
under the law has been a mooted ques
tion with the state authorities, and
the officers at the Kanawha camp 'n
West Virginia, as it ha8 been in ov
ery state. At last it is defined, and
by the judge advocate general oj
the arm, Dridg. Gen. Growder. In a
lengthy written opinion which has
been handed to the Secrotary of War
for his guidance.
Gen. Crowder holds that the state
soldiers are not subject to duty out
side of the United States unless and
until they are formally drafted by or
der of the President; that they are
under control of the Federal govern
ment and not of their respective state
governors; and that they are entitled
to the samo ponsions and privileges
as regulars.
Willie congress by joints resolution
has conferred upon the President au
thority to draft the militia and na
tional guard, in his dicretion, the gen
eral points out that the President has
not exercised that authority.
In the meantime, he says, the status
of the state troops "Is that of militia
called Into the service of the United
States for one of the purposes spec!*
fied in the constitution, that lsAto
protect the Unltod States from invas
ion.'
Thero are three classes of troops
now in Federal service, according to
the opinion. They are:
First, "The organized militia" of
Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, sum
moned by the President in his first
call for state troops under tho Dick
law of 1003:
Second, The National guard automa
tically placed In Federal service un
der the now national defense act?
the Hay-Chamberlain bill; and
Third, The regular troops.
Militia which have not qualified un
der the new law. have status identi
cal with those of Texas Arizona and
New Mexico.
Promptly complying with a tele
graphic request for 50 copies of the
new defonse act (Hay-Chamberlain),
Congressman Sutherland had 25 cop
ies, as many as he could secure at
this time, sent to Col. Charles E. Mor
rison in command of the forces at
Camp Kanawha, for distribution
among, his officers.
FEW cm
One Mild Case of Typhoid
Reported During
July.
PHYSICIANS_CARELESS
Liable to Heavy Fines For
Ignoring Ordinance Re
quiring Reports.
Contagious and transmissible dis
eases are fewer this month in Fair
mont than for many years according
to the report of the city Health Depart
ment today, for the month of July.
Only ten cases of measles wore re
ported and although tnore is thought
to be several very mild cases of this
malady that were not reported, yet this
disease Is well in hand and by the
first of next month It is thought that
all of the measles will ho eliminated.
One case of typhoid fever was re
ported and it was exceptionally mild.
| The patient is now about well and the
community at present is free from this
dangerous disease.
Eight cases of whooping cough were
reported but all of these are free from j
complications and are very light at-1
tacks.
No deaths from any transmissible
diseases were reported. At present';
there is only one physician in Fair
mont who reports all of his deaths:
promptly as required by the city or-j
dinance.
This ordinanco which has really nev
er really been enforced is a good one
and requires all the doctors to.report
their deaths immediately, and to ob
tain a burial permit from the city
Health Department before they can be
Interned. This is absolutely disre
garded and the physicians at present
I do not even report the deaths except
I to the county clerk.
| With the growth of the city and the
I recognition of the importance of vital
statistics it is likely that an attempt
will be made to enforce this ordinance
I or else take It off the books. The fine
I for failure to comply with the regula
tions is now $10 to $50. No one has
lever yet been fined under this law.
BATHING PLACES
POPULAR SUNDAY
Hundreds Were Bathing
But Not a Single Accident
Was Reported.
i
Seeking to escape the almost un
bearable heat and humidity yesterday
many Fairmont persons took refuge in
the waters of the Monongahela,* Ty
garts Valley and Buffalo creek. But
even there tho humanity present in
the water, especially at the best beach
es along the Tygarts Valley and along
Buffalo creek, made swimming uncom
fortable. The crowds were so thick
at many places that the more adven
curious craw fish who : 'bbled at the
ing 6ome excitable woman or child.
That the waters were considerably
stirred by tho frantic struggles of the
bathers is shown by the reportB from
down the river where the inhabitants
observing the rise in the pool level and
the muddy water thought rain musT
have fallen at Fairmont.
However, despite the fact that yes
terday was the first time in tho watei
this soason for many of the bathers,
no drownings were reported and the
worst accident was the bite of some
curious craw fiflsh who nibbled at the
toes of the more timid who "swim with
one foot on the bottom."
By automobile, train and trolley car.
the crowds went to the bathing spots,
until by the middle of the atfernoon
there were hundreds at Valley Falls
and Buffalo Creek.
On down the river at Wildwood,
Comfort, Oresta Club, Altahwah, Idle- j
wood and Westwood there were large
crowds. About four hundred people
bought tickets for up the river and
last night coming down on the 8:20
train two extra coaches were put on
and btill that couldn't accommodate
the crowds. The train was twenty
minutes late when it reached Fairmont
on account of the large crowds getting
on at the different stops. On the Man- j
nington car line extra street cars were!
run from town out to Mohawk to ac
commodate the large crowd that spent i
the day along Buffalo Creek.
The majority of those who sought
the watering places, took baskets
packed with eatables and enjoyed pic
nic dinners and suppers.
