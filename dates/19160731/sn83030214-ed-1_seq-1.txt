RAILROAD AGERT AND STORAGE
OFRCIAL HELD IN $5,000 BAI
Head of Towing Company To Be Arrested To-day
?Lehigh Blames Fire on Barge Belong
ing to Others.
Dynamite, cellulose and shrapnel, exploding in carload salvos within
two miles of the treasure houses of lower Manhattan, shook the island to
bedrock early yesterday morning.
It was 2:08 o'clock when Black Tom, a peninsula on the Jersey City
side of the Upper Bay, whereior days and weeks munition shipments for
Europe have been piling up, erupted, hurling whole cases of *nrapnel half
a mile and bombarding the harbor, Bedloe's and Ellis islands and Jersey
City with shot, shell and debris. Powder-laden lighters were transformed
into fireboats, which bore down upon New York's waterfront on a flood
tide.
Only four lives are known to be lost, but among the scattered crews
of barges, schooners and other craft there are still nearly 200 men to be
accounted for.
The property loss is estimated at $45,000,000.
Warrants charging manslaughter were issued last night for Theodore
B. Johnson, head of the Johnson Lighterage and Towing Company; Al?
bert M. Dickman, Lehigh Valley agent at the Black Tom docks, and Alex?
ander Davidson, superintendent of the National Storage Company. Dick?
man and Davidson were arrested in their homes, in Jersey City, and were
held in $5,000 bail. Johnson was out of town and cannot be taken into
custody until to-day.
The New Jersey laws provide that explosives in great quantities must
not be more than twenty-four hours in loading.
Although railroad officiais asserted that a fire on a lighter was respon
sible, others declared that a car loaded with dynamite caught fire and was
shunted into another car, similarly loaded, by its panic-stricken crew.
There is no suspicion that the fire was incendiary.
RAILROAD BLAMES
INDEPENDENT BARGE
The following itBtemenl was
iaaued jreaterdaysfrom thc otficea
of thc Lehigh Valley Raili i
Thirteen brick storage ware
houscs out of thc twenty-four
owned and operated by the Na?
tional Storage Company. and six
piers owned by the storage com?
pany anH lcased to thc Lehigh
Valley Railroad, were destroyed.
Several others of the brick ware
houses were badly damaged ard
som: minor damage was done to
the Lehigh Valley's grain eleva?
tor. In addition. as far as is
known. eighty-five loaded cars
were destroyed.
According to the evidence ob?
tained by the officiais of the rail?
road company. the tire started at
1-05 this morning in a barge be
longing to an independent tow?
ing company. which had been
moored alongside the railroad
company's docks expressly
against orders.
M. T. Henley, night general
yard master for the New York
division of the Lehigh Valley
Railroad, was on the pier when
the fire started. He says the ex?
plosion. which occurred at 2:08,
was on the barge where thc tire
started.
Mr. Henley's first thought was
to remove the loaded cars on the
pier from the danger zone. He
says that when he reached the
end of the pier the barge was
burning fiercely all over and the
fire was beginning to communi
cate itself to some of the cars
nearest the barge. Two long cuts
of cars were successfully re?
moved from the danger zone be?
fore the rapidly spreading fire
engulfed the balance.
As yet it has not been definite
ly determined just what the
money loss will be. Some 40,000
tons of raw _ugar. valued at ap
proximately $3,400,000, is known
to be lost, but it is believed that
?he other contents of the ware
houses destroyed will greatly in?
crease this amount.
There were no explosives
stored in the warehouses and in
but two of the cars destroyed.
These cars were loaded with
shrapnel, which would not have
been a source of danger but for
the outside fire. The other cars
destroyed were loaded principal
ly with salt and borax.
The scene of the explosion
and fire is in no way adjacent to
the main passenger and freight
terminals of the Lehigh Valley
Railroad at either New York or
Jersey City. and the mishap will
not interfere in any way with
the operation of business.
Manhattan rocked at the first concu.ssion. Houses were
jarred as far away as Rockaway. The explosion was heard
in Philadelphia.
The damage in New York il estimated at $500,000. Shat
r.ered windows littered the downtown streets. Show windows
were laid open and valuables lay unprotected in Maiden Lane
windows. Only one case of looting was reported to the police
and the amount taken wai inconsiderable.
RESERVES WERE READY FOR CALL.
Owing to the trolley strike, the reserves were ready for
the call. and to them were added the policemen in the military
training camp at Fort Wadsworth. They came in khaki.
Lower Broadway, Maiden Lane, Nassau Street and other thor
oughfaros, where thieves would have found rich booty, wera
roped off and guarded by cordons of patrolmen. On other
streets pedestrians were warned to keep to the middle of tha
road.
For more than two hours harbor shipping was menaced by
a bombardment that came not only from Black Tom but from
scores of barges that had been cut or burned from their moor-?
ings and drifted up toward the Battery on the flood tide. Four
circled Ellis Island.
Ceilingl and wmlll were eracked and not a window escaped*
The damage may be $.50,000 or .$100,000. The 250 immigrants
who were not in the infirmary, many of them excluded women
and children who are barred by the war from returning to theie
own countries, were huddled aboard the government boat,
which ran the gantlet of the flaming, belching lighters to South
Ferry.
STATUE OF LIBERTY UTERALLY BOMBARDED.
The Statue of Liberty and the military post on Bedloe'j
Island formed another target. Whole cases of shrapnel fell
about the soldiers' quarters. Some of the missiles came from
Black Tom, half a mile away. Iron doors were dented and tom
from their hinges. The damage there was estimated at $1.50,.
000. ('aptain Clifton, the commanding o/ficer, assembled thu
families of the oftkers on the parade ground, where they cow
ered in safety while their houses were shelled.
With shrill whistles tooting for right of way, N'ew York'l
fireboats-charged through the fire-tinged mist and attacked thu
powder-laden barges. Close to the blazing magazines they ran
and manned their bliste/ing monitors at a range that broughl
the full volume of every stream into play. Tugboats equippe*)
with pumps and hose lines joined the fray and did yeoman sen
vice in quenching the flames and towing the deadl.v flotilla out
of the way.
After the first detonation from Black Tom came a series ol
sharp explosions like a pack of huge firecrackers. A hideout)
glare Iit up the great mushroom of smoke that had sailed up uni
seen from the first explosion. A flaming are, reaching nearly t4
the zenith, shone over Manhattan and the Upper Bay. Through
out Manhattan and Brooklyn peopie ran to the street. looking
lor anything from an earthquake to Kingdom Come.
The damage zone extended well up into the hotel and dfj
