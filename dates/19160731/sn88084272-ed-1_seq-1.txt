PASSENGERS BURIED UNDER
ARIZONA WRECK ARE UNHURT
Phoenix. Ariz.. Julv 3!. Though half
a hundred passfnger were buried un
der the wreck of a Santa Fe train Xo.
15. 40 miles north of Phoenix at 7:33
o'clock Sunday morning, not a casualty
or even a serious injury resulted.
The wreck was caused by a weak
ening of a short trestle by rains, al
lowing four coaches to pile up. Th
fact that tne cars were of wood and
were badly smasned, makes It all the
more marvelous that nobody was hurt.
The engine passed safely over the
bridge, which gave way beneath the
tender, throwing the latter 150 feet
from the right of way.
The chair car slid down the 12 foot
b:ink and the others piled up against
itt unner end. From the engine, which
staxed on the track to the last truck
on thp final Pullman, not a truck re-
m.iined either on fh track or on th
cars. In the Pullmans, passengers
were just dressing w hen the crash
came. They were hurled about in negli
gee attire and imprisoned until some
of the men chopped their was- to liberty.
