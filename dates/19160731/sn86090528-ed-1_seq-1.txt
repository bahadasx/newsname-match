ed to Allies Does Damage of From
Twenty to Fifty Millions

Whether the fire started on a barge
which was loaded with nitro cellulose
or on four freight cars loaded with
high explosives Is unknown. Per
il a ps the real cause of the holocaust
will never be known.
The condition o the area which was
devastated by the explosion made it
impossible to examine the scene of
the first explosion this morning. The
wreckage of railroad cars and ware
houses Is still burning. Shrapnel
shells which are buried In the ruins
are igniting occasionally, kaoping the
firymen at a respectful distance.
The ammunition was a consign

COLLEGE COMMENTED ON
IN BIG EASTERN DAILY
Not only has the Oklahoma College
for Women long slnca ceased to be
looked upon in this state as a "sectional
institution," but with Its ideal educa-
tion for women, strong faculty and
lack of tuition in every department, it
has begun to attract the attention of
school men throughout the country.
The article given below appeared re
cently in tho Christfan Science Moni
tor, world daily, published in Boston
and read wherever the English lan
guage is spoken. It appeared under
the heading, "Oklahoma School for
Women Proves Marked Success." The
article in full follows:
A notable experiment in educational
lines is" the Oklahoma College for Wo
men, a' school exclusively for girls, as
Its name Indicates, and kept up entirely
by the state. Its success during the
past few years indicates that the day
of the separate school Is not pa.st.
Though the Idea of the founders
was to make the work all of collegiate
rank, the great demand for secondary
training, due to poor schools in the In
dian Torritory country In the early
days, has made ft impossible to reject
young women who have not completed
high school work. Courses are given
UP AGAINST REAL THING.
y
'
It was not with a light heart that
most of the teachers wended their di
vers ways from the court house to
their various homes on Saturday after
noon after undergoing what is known
83 one of the most difficult examina
tions ever submitted to applicants for
first grade certificates in this county.
Two of the teachers threw up their
hands and o.uit before the exam was
over but the others plodded on, un
certain, however, of results.
The questions were prepared by the
state board of education and will be
examined by the local examining
board.

No attempt is being made to serve
others than the young women of its
own state. It Is seeking to find the
Ideal education for the young women
of Oklahoma, and to furnish that edu
cation at a cost that can be met by
the great masseB of people, especially
the farmers.
During the past year, board and
room wero furnished by the state dor
mitories at $16 a month. Buying di
rect from the farm was what made
the rato possible, college authorities
say. Some young women have taken
a year's study at a total cost of $175.
President G. W. Austin calls the ed
ucation he is experimenting with
"Education for the Home." There are
two great features, household eco
nomics and music. These are given
besides the regular high school and

the past year showed an increase over
that of the year before of 71 per cent

Another Victim of Careless Boarding and
Leaving Cars Brought to Hospital
With Leg Crushed
Mobley of near Alex was
brought to tho Chlckasha hospital Sat
urday with one leg severed through
the knoe, the result of trying to hoard
a passenger train while It was moving.
M,obley is the second victim to be
injured in the past few days by trying
to leave or enter a car when in mo
tion. His accident occurred at Rush
Springs Saturday morning. He threw
his suit case on the platform as the
trail was pulling out of that station,
and caught hold of the coach. The
down-grade movement of the train
was too strong for him, however, and
he fell with one leg under the wheels.
The limb was completely amputated
at the knee.
COMMISSIONERS HAVE NO
JURISDICTION OVER TWP.
"I want to say that the county com
missioners have no jurisdiction over
township roads," said Commissioner
J. A. Robinson today, "We have had
many complaints concerning tho road
east of Chickasha for a long time. It
Is In bad shape and we have asked
the township board to act but have
been unable to get it repaired. The
public should understand that the com
missioners have nothing to do in a
case of this kind, the entire repsonsi
bility resting with the township
boards."
APPEAL FOR SUPPORT OF
SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT
(By Senator Chas. B. Barrett.)
Oklahoma City, July 31. Through
their party organ, the "Appeal to Rea
son," and through other channels, the
Socialists urge voters to vote against
every one or the nine constitutional
amendments submitted at Tuesday's
election.
In their mad opposition to the litera
cy test they urgo people to vote against
the other eight amendments as well.
This, notwithstanding there are among
these amendments some which all
good citizens agree are vitally impor
tant and should be adopted.
For instance, the amendment to the
Workmen's Compensation Law, which
will make it possible for the state in
dustrial commission to settle speedily
the amount of damages due to the
widow and children for the death of a
workman, wihout the delay and un
certainty and expense of a law suit.
Both labor and -employers are practi
cally unanimous for this amendment
all but the Socialists and some Repub
lican politicians.
In their insane zeal to defeat the
literacy test, the Socialists and their
allies by their attitude say: "We care
not how many laborers' orphaned chil
dren cry for bread just so ve can
save the illiterate, criminal negro'n
right to vote!"
Will you listen to the r.pprraf of such
an unpatriotic, such an unholy alliance?
All of thoe amendments were jubmit
(ted In tke p-triQtic effort to make a!

RAIDS ON

Consignment to Chickasha Seized in Cot

Busy at Yerden Station
The tangible assets In booze upon
which certain clandestine vendor's hud
reckoned on election day, will be ma
terially decreased as a rosult of raids
which are being made by both local
and out of county officers.
County Attorney Venablo, accompa
nied by Chief Deputy Castleman, made
another raid on the station at Verden
Saturday afternoon and left this morn
ing on a similar mission. Saturday
they seized two or three packages of
whiskey and two barrels of beer.
Word was received here this morn
ing that yesterday In Cotton county
tho sheriff of that county had held up
an automobile containing five or six
sacks of whiskey containing twenty
five or thirty gallons, and some beor.
Tho liquor was on its way to Chicka
sha. The driver of the car, L .E. How
ell, was arrested, but his companion
was not caught. The liquor was con
fiscated. Reurning from Verden at noon Pep.
uty Sheriff CaHtleman reported having
seized two barrels of beer and five
gallons, of whiskey, making a total
seized at Verden station six barrels of
beer and fifteen gallons of whiskey
during tho past few days.
A large crowd took picnic dinners
to the home of II. C. Ucker, near the
north bridge, yesterday, spending tho
day most pleasantly.
good state government still a better
one. .Opinions will differ, of course,
as to the merits of particular anient,
incuts; but every good citizen rho
gives any thought to those amend
ments will want to vote for some of
them.
Those Socialist and Republican lead
ers have worked themselves up to a
frenzy In their opposition to this suf
frage amendment, which is merely a
substitute for the "Grandfather
Clause" adopted six years ago by the
people of Oklahoma. There Is abso
lutely no reason in the world why any-
one who voted for the old "Grandfath-
er Clause" should not support this new
amendment. The prime purpose of
the two is the same and the method of
voting upon each Is the same.
Good government demands good citi
zenship. Through the double-standard
of literacy and patriotism which the
suffrage , amendment imposes, evtnf
good citizen, be he rich or poor, learn
ed or unlearned, will have a voice In
the government, while the vicious and
criminal will be eliminated.
This Is just such a voting qualifica
tion as is already required in twelve j
good itats In the Union states rep- j
resenting every section of the nation .

and good citizenship. Cast your vote

SAY8 HE STOLE SILVER.
Although Ollle Young, an Illiterate
fellow who has been a charge support
ed by the Charities board for some time
has at time admitted and then denied
guilt in the case of the burglary of
tho home of Lee Olive on Saturday
night a week ago, city officers, wing
to the mental capacity of the prisoner,
do not placo much credence in his
stories. Ollie was arrested by the city
officers and placed In the city jail but
was ordered released by the mayor on
the ground that the case was not with
in the jurisdiction of the city court.
Ollle, who was at one time employ
ed by Mrs. Olive, told the officers
where the basket containing the stol
en silver was hidden and a search In
the weeds revealed the presence of
some of the missing napery. A small
er boy, however, had previously found
tho basket a few feet from the spot In
dictated by the erstwhile prisoner.
