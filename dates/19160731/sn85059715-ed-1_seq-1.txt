The Telegram's hlg circulation i
campaign is over. The winners have I
been decided and the prizes awartl- j
ed.
The campaign was one of the most j
successful ever conducted in Clarks- j
burg and was satisfactory in ever re- J
spect both to the workers who participated
in the race and to the Teleit
ti?? twpn conducted on a
fair and square basis and tliis
newspaper has lived up to every
agreement It made. In a campaign i
of this sort, as In politics there must
be some winners and some losers.
This is true in all contests, and
while the Telegram rejoices with
the winners, It also sympathizes with
I hose who failed after so valiant a
light, and expresses the wish that
every contestant could have been
awarded a prize. However, in the
rase of the 10,000 Cluh all non-win-)
ners who remained active up until
Ihe close of the campaign, will receive
a nice cash salary of twenty
per cent of the amount which theyj
have turned In on new subscriptions,1
so in reality there were no losers:
lifter all.
It is unnecessary to say that the;
winners were the most consistent!
