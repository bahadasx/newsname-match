(By Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
LONDON, July 30. The opening of the present week finds the prospects
of the entente allies perhaps brighter than in any previous period ot the
war, according to the views held here. General Brussilott's striking victories
present the German general staff with the imperative problem of how to
reinforce the eastern front since General von Linsingen, who was sent by
the Germans to aid the shattered Austrian, now has been completely thrust
back from the Lutsk salient.
But the same problem is presented on the western front, where, says
an unofficial correspondent, "the ceaseless ofiensive seems steadily to gain
in intensity. Doubtc3 ine constant arrival of fresh German troops and
guns," he says, "has anything to do with the result. The enemy shows an
increasing tendency to counter-attack."
These counter attacks have failed to stem the steady entente allied ad
vance and although at the present moment the fighting on the Somme is
mainly devoted to securing mastery of small strategic positions, which will
be the keys to further progress, there is yet no sign of the uermans making
any effective counter offensive. i
The Russians' remarkable victories reveal a most interesting situation.
The a.-my cf the German general, Count von Bothmer, holding the Stripa
near the Lemberg-Tarnopol railroad, was a few weeks ago being outflanked
on the south by General Letchitzky't successful advance when the Dniester
Hoods prevented Letchitzky's further progress. This enabled von Bothmer
to hold on to the threatened positions. General Sakharoff then devoted
himself to enveloping von Bothmer's force on the north, with what success
is seen in his double victory west of Lutsk and Brody.
Thus outflanked north and south. it is considered impossible that Count
von Bothmer can longer delay extricating himself from his precarious posi
tion, even if he can now do so without serious losses. The Russians at Brody
are at present nearer Lemberg than von Bothmer's forces, which are en
trusted with Lemberg's defense and although the country between Brody and
Lemberg is very difficult, it becomes a question whether the evacuation of
both Kovel and Lemberg will not soon become necessary.

I.ONI'ON, July 30. Parties of Can
adian infantry last night successfully
raided the German trendies in two
places south of i pres. it was an
nounced today by General Haig. A
miliar raid was ral l ied out by the
Roul .Minuter Fusilcers in the Loos
i.alieiit. The German casualties in each
rase, the statement adds, were severe.
A German force succeeded in raiding
a F.ritish front treiicn near Hohen-zol!-rn
redoubt.
The text of the British official com
munication follows:
'1-ist night ' heavily bombarded
the enemy's trenches in two places
souih of Ypres and the Royal Munster
Fusileers carried out a similar enter
prise in the Loos salient. The enemy's
casualties in each rase were severe.
".War Holienzollern redoubt the Ger
mans attempted two raids. One of
these ailed to Ret farther than our
wire. The uther succeeded in enter
ing our front trench but tiie enemy
was immediately driven out."
further advances by the British are
reported in the latest dispatch from
General Haig, ill command on the
French front. A heavy engagement
was fought on the sector between Ijel- i
ville wood and the Homme, with the
result that tiie British moved their line
forward east of Waterlot farm and
'front's wood.
Special dispatches from Saloniki say I
that Serbian successes at the Greek
frontier continue and that the Serbians
are entrenching on a line only 300 yards
from the frontier. Thursday a large
force of Bulgarians attacked the Ser
bian positions north of Strupino, but
a powerful counter attack routed them,

traveling slowly because of a cloud

before the engineer, Oswald, could stop
it. Tiie engine and baggage car were
carried into the swollen stream.

Phoenix yesterday morning
ahout 7 o'clock, train No. 15,
Los Angeles to Phoenix, in
charge of Conductor J. C.
(i raves and Engineer Wm.
Delano, hit a weak bridge
near Xada, about thirty-five
miles north of Phoenix, and
practically the- whole train
was demolished, but by some
miracle or other, no one was
killed. Minor injuries were
received by some of the thirty-three
passengers, none
I necccsitating the attention
' of a surgeon.
The train, which is due in
here at 7:35 p. m., was not
running very fast at the time
of the accident. The first in
timation that the passengers
had that anything was
wrong was when, with a
terrific crash, tin; Pullman
which was attached behind a
chair car, was completely
doubled up. The chair car
was badly smashed.
A baggage car, chair car. and two
Pullmans composed the train, the rear
ruiiman running empty.
According to Engineer Delano, ho
was running slow at the time of the
(accident, tearing tnat neavy rains dur
ing the night, had weakened some of
the wooden bridges along the line. As
he started out on the bridge at Nada,
he felt it weaken. He threw on steam,
in the hopes that the momentum would
carry him across. He succeeded in
getting his engine across, in safety,
but by the time the tender had hit the
bridge, it had sunk so far below the
level of the track, that it was com
pletely derailed, and thrown for a con
siderable distance to the left side of
the track. The tender turned over and
over as it spun across the landscape.
The baggage car followed the tender,
turned over once, but was not smashed.
'The bagoageman was bruised by be
jing thrown when the car turned over.
Conductor Graves was the first man
on his feet after the crash, and rushed
'through the front Pullman to ascer
tain the damage. He caught a glimpse
through the forward window of the
chair car. and made the exclamation
that everyone in that car had been
killed. At this, women in the Pull
man fainted, and all the men were
kept busy reviving them.
The doors to the Pullman were
jammed, preventing the passengers
from getting out. Kmergency axes and
saws were brought into use and a hole
cut in the side of the car. A hasty
organization was effected, and the
passengers in the chair car were res
cued. From the appearance of the wreck,
those who went through it were at a
loss to know how any one in either the
chair car or I'ullman escaped alive.
As soon as everyone had been taken
from the wreck, a wire to Phoenix was
and after some slight delay.
connections made with Choemx. A re
lief train and wrecker were hurriedly
sent out, and the belated travellera
brought into Phoenix. ''The train from
Ash Fork to Phoenix, over the Santa
Fe Phoenix and I'rescott, had pulled
in behind the wreck, it being neces
sary to transfer its passengers around
to the relief train.
