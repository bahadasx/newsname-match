BATTLE OF BENNINGTON
How Its Anniversary Was
117 Years Ago.
Springfield, Mo., July
Observed
24, 181ft
Editor Bennington Banner,
Bennington, Vermont.
Dear Sir:
As the ltith of August, sacred to
every man with Bennington blood in
his veins, or love of country In his
heart, draws near, it occurs to me thai
perhaps your readers might be inter
ested in the inclosed account of a cel
ebration of Bennington's great day
held in 17!if, and I have taken the lib
erty of sending it to you, as the part oi
at least one old BennlngtoUian in tho
celebration of the day. 1 am proud to
be able to claim Anthony Haswell,
who is mentioned in this report of thai
day, as my grandfather, and I have a
large collection of his writings and
accounts Of his life.
You may bo interested to know that
even out here in the beautiful Ozarks
of Missouri, we have also a sacred
day which we celebrate in August, al
though our date is the 10th, and not
the 16th. Ten miles from our city
was fought on August 10th, 1861, tho
battle of Wilson Creek, where bravo
Genera Nathaniel Lyon of Connect!
CUt, was slain, together With more
than six hundred others from the
I Union and Confederate armies,
Last year I bad the honor oi inak-
lug an address on that battle ground,
at the annual celebration of that day.
1 had in my audience many old veter
ans from both sides who had fought
on that held. I assure you that those
old men mingled "Rebel yells," and
"I'nion cheers," at (-very patriotic ex
pression in my talk, ami today many of
1 their sons and grandsons are with our
I troops on the Mexican boundary, true
it U that:
"Beneath one flag their sons march
side by side,
And nevermore shall strife and hate
their gallant ranks divide,"
Yours truly,
A. M. Haswell.
On the 16th Of August 17!i!. the citi
zens of Bennington gathered tO cele
brate the twenty-second anniversary
of the famous old battle Which took
its name from the town, from an
Old pamphlet printed in 1799 by Anth
ony Haswell, we (piote a part of the re
cord ol that celebiation one hundred
and nine years ago.
Tho orator of the day was that same
Anthony liuswell, llrst printer west of
the green mountains in Vermont
founder and editor of the "Vermont
Gazette," first paper went of the
mountains; first postmaster general
of the new state of Vermont; who lay
ill prison lor months, sentenced under
those Infamous laws of our early his
tory whlcn sought to muzzle the free
dim of the press; a man of note from
the time lie came to Bennington In
1783. until his death in 1818. His
tomb can still be seen just east of
the old Congregational church in lieu
nington Center.
The oration as a whole Is too long
to quote here, but a lew paragraphs
from it are interesting, and SO me are
most lit and applicable to our own
day, and our present national situa
tion.
Never, O, never can Vermont for

Willi open bosoms lo oppose ilie foe, to
check his progress, or to share our
fate. Heaven smiled upon their cf
lorts; of them it is scarce flattery to
say: "They came, they saw. they
conquered."
The fate of Ameiicn at that time ap
peared suspended With ail even beam
and this the pivot on which all must
turn. I lie (leleat of llauui. Uli'lor

Which patriots only know.
The thundering cannons cease to roar
Bweet peace her timbrel sounds
The din of war is heard no more,

"After the oration." another song
was sung, this written by the orator
of the day himself.
'Columbia rejoice, let praises resound,
