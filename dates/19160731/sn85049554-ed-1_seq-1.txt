Prank Hague,- commissioner of pub
lie safety of Jersey City, charged that
the blame of the explosion lay either
with the Lehigh Valley railroad, the
storage company or the lighterage com.
pany, and that one of them had vio
lated the laws of-New Jersey J?y per

the Are which caused the explosion
that, destroyed $5,000,000 worth of
ammunition, eighty-five freight cars,
and set bfpzing barges adrift to bom

shrapnel and, shells. One of the inves
tigations is conducted by Col. B. W.
Dunn, chief inspector of the bureau of
explosives of the I American Railway
Association and the Interstate com
merce commission.
May Have Been Incendiary.
It is understood that agents of the
department of justice are making in
"quiries to learn If the explosion was
the work of incendiaries. Lehigh Val
ley officials assert that an interloping
b^rge loaded with ammunition was
moored at their pier in defiance of
their orders and that the first explo
sion' took place on bpard that vessel.
The eommiss^loher of public safety says
ttiat four targes were# at or near the
pier and it is feared their crews per
ished.
The big pier today Is a mass of
smoktog ruins, with the debris, piled
hundreds of. Met high in places and
this fire still burntng.
Damage on Ellis Island.
Thtwork of repairing the damage to
bondings on Bedloe's and Ellis islands
and in New York and Jersey Cl£y be
gan today. The Ellis island immigra
tion station had every'* appearance of
a war-cacRed village.' Every window
was shattered, the roof of the hospital
^yed in, the main door blown away,
aijfi) the dining and executive rooms
wwe wrecked, while the island was
strewn with bits of shrapnel, broken
flails and three-inch shells thrown
*fhore from drifting barges. The dam
Wte was estimated at $75,000.

^Th® buildings on Bedloe's island,'
With doors blown in and windows shat
tered .showed the marks of an elght
bombardment of sharpnel, iron
bolts and pieces of steel, while the
homes of army officers are stripped of
chimneys.- The loss there is estimated
at $100,000. The statue of Liberty vir^

the pedestal are blown in. Stories told

It was apparent that the explosion
did the greatest damage in the area
occupied by the freight cars. It is said
eighty-seven of them .stood on the
tracks upon this stretch, which was
once solid land, but is now a vast
pond. It was among these freight cars
at this point that Cornelius 3. Leyden
chief of the Lehigh Valley police, was
,standing when last seen alive. With
hiin were several other men. The
floating barges and the territory sur
rounding the crater were strewn with
exploded shells of various sizes.

Felt in, Fiv# States.
The detonayons.'iwhich were felt in
five states, began ^rith a continuous
japld fire of smalt (hells, the bowing
up of great quantities of .dynamite,
nitre-cellulose aid other high explo
sives, followed by the bursting 'of thou
sands of shrapnl shells which liter
ally showered surrounding land and
water for many miles around.
Black Tom island is an area of re
claimed land, which projects Into New
York bay from the Jersey shore, im
mediately behind, the statue of Liberty.
Six Lehigh Valley railroad piers and
the National Storage houses compris
ing thirty-four three-story brick build
ings about a hundred feet deep, were
the principal sufferers.
Warehouses Are Destroyed. .'
Between $25,000,000 and $30,000,0(0
worth of property belonging to these
two companies was hurled into the air
by the force of the explosions. Thir
teen storage warehouses and their en
tire contents were burned, a dozen
barges" and their Contents burned or
blown up and probably three tug boats
sunk.
Three tug boats, with an aggregate
total of thirty-four men, are listed as
missing. These boats are the Geneva,
Brldgeton and Ithaca. When last seen
the little vessels were bravely forc
ing their way into the blazing barges
in effort to remove them. Then oc
curred the big explosion. It is feared
'they were torn to pieces and lost with
their crews.
Countless Homes Damaged.
About a million dollars worth of
damage was done on Bedloe's island
and Ellis island suffered, "severely.
Countless homes and business places
running up into the hundreds of thou
sands were more or less damaged Mi
Jersey City, Hoboken, Manhattan, the
Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Bayonne, Sta
ten Island and adjacent cities and.
towns. Smashed plate glass windows
was the principal loss suffered. A con
servative estimate of this loss is $1.
500,000.
The origin of the blaze whloh caused
ruin and death has not yet been estab
lished. This fire, as nearly as be
established from eye witnesses, began
either in a freight car on the "explo
siva pief," or on barge moored to
the pier, about ten minutes after mid
night.
The Lehigh Valley Railroad Com
pany, in an official statement, lays the
blame an a 'barge owned by an inde
pendent towing company which, against
orders, had moored ''toHhe pier. The
railroad charges th-fir* began on this
barge. Some eyewitnesses assert the
conflagration started otf a freight car.
Like a Cannonade.
Many of the shells shot toward the
open bay. It was a wonderful sight
the early morning watchers beheld as
the shells rfcochetted along the sur
face ot the. water. Hbw the onlookers
who swarmed the bay 'front escaped
injury Cfujnot be explained.
About 5 o'clock one would have im
agined that the blazing barges were
un charge of fnrinea,-gunners., Several
TMHfilflfia shells exploded almost sim
tlflnuttoualy. -v*
Statue of Liberty Damaged.
Damage to the statue of Liberty
has been variously estimated at from
$100,000 to $1,000,000. The latter is
the guess of Captain Clinton, in charge
of Liberty island. The exact injury
can not be ascertained until experts
have made a careful examination of
the pedestal and base of the statue.
Bedloe Island, afmost on a direct line
yvith Black Tom, bore the brunt of the
shock. A warehouse recently complet
ed there is practically in ruins.
The first thought of the officers and
men who comprise the little army post
was for Miss Liberty." Thru an ava
lanche of dirt and pieces of flying
shrapnel a detail of tjjree men with a
noncommissioned officer ran to the
statue after the flnjt blast. They found
it badly damaged.
The light-on the. statue, however,
burned steadily,. not even flickering
when the successive blasts rattled the
monument to Its foundation. The main
door, a hekvy iron affair, weighing
nearly a ton, was blown completely
off its hinges.'
Thirteen Warehouses Wrecked.
At least $10,000,000, probably $15,
000,000, damage was caused by de
struction- of thirteen of the eighteen
warehouses of the National Storage
Company Jfi Jersey City, Edmund L.
Mackenzie stated today. This loss la
amply covered by Insurance.
The damaged goods Included 30,000
tons of raw sugar, valued at between
13,000,00ft^ and $4,Q00,0Q0, and 24,000
bales ot tobacco.
On consignments, of munitions snd
other supplies going to France, loss
will fall on insurance companies, owing
ran
IJcle
the
to the fact that policies on French
shipments begin from the first delivery,
British shipments ay* insured only at
"waterside.".

noted convict, and two other prisoners,
