When I anre Shipment of Ammiinl,

tlons Exploded At Least Two
Pei-seas Killed and a
Score Injured.
New York, July JO Property loaa
estimated at 126,000,000 waa caused
early today by a serlea of terrific ex
ploslons of ammunition awaiting snip
ment to the Entente Allies and stored
on Black Tom Inland, a small strip of
land Jutting Into New York Bay off
Jersey City. The loss of life still was
problematical tonight It will not be
determined definitely until there has
been opportunity to check up the
workmen employed on the island and
on boats moored nearby.
Two are known to be dead and at
least two more are missing. Scores
of persons were Injured, some of them
probably mortally.
The detonations, which were felt in
fire states, began with a continuous
rapid fire of small shells, then the
blowing up of great quantities of dyn
amite, and other high explosives, fol
lowed by the bursting of thousands of
shrapnel shells which literally show
ered the surrounding country and
waters for many miles around.
Fire that started soon after the first
great crash, which spread death and
desolation In Its wake, destroyed
thirteen of the huge warehouses of the
National Storage Company on Black
Tom Island In whloh were stored mer
chant dyes valued at between 112,-
000,000 and 116,000,000. The flames
shooting into the clouda were reflected
against New York's skyline of tower
ing office buildings, which only a few
minutes before were shaken to their
foundations as If by an earthquake
Miles of streets in Manhattan alone
were strewn with broken glass and
shattered slgnB.

Albert, the twelve year old son of
Dr. J. A. Simpson of Forest avenue.
Buffered a severe accident yesterday
morning when he fell from the L. tt
N bridge between the depot and For
est avenue.
The boy was returning from Sun
day School and was walking on the

dropped from a train in his path
and he attempted to kick it off the
bridge. As he kicked his foot slipped
and he fell off the bridge.
The bridge at the point where young
Simpson fell off is about thirty feet
from the ground and tbe fall must
have been terrific. Some of his com
panions with him went for aid and he
was taken to his home. Drs. Taylor
and Quigley were summoned but In
vestigation proved that he was not hurt
seriuusly. At first it was thongnt be
was Injured internally but no evi
dence has been sbown to prove this.
No bones were broken but his lower
limbs were badly bruised. Several
minor cuts were sustained but bruises
were the chief injuries. He is re
ported as somewhat improved this
morning although stiu badly shaken
by the fall.

lar Fourth of July time fireworks in
abundance and great balls of trouble
lo untagle.

ing money for a dress the style of which is more or less neutral or negative.
Why not have yours a positive affirmation of the present season's modes? I need
not necessarily shout it down-to-the-minuteness there is a quiet but none the less
emphatic manner of expressing the style just as there is a blatant and ultra man
