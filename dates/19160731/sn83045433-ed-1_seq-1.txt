(By the laIteratiial News Service.)
Chicago, July 30.-The death-dealing
heat wave weeping the Middle West
reached its climax today. In Chicago the
offioial weather bureau thermometer
reached the high mark of 102 degrees; at
Clarendon Beah, the most frequented of
the municipal bathing beaches, the
official "high" was 112.
More than ninty-flverdeaths had been
reported to the coroner's office at 9
o'clock. This does not include deaths of
sixty babies or lists of persons attended
by private physicians. It is probable
that when the final records for the day
are compiled more than 20 will be found
to have succumbed to the ravages of
the intense heat.
Prostrations were only vaguely esti
mated. One figure, based on incomplete
pollee reports. placed the number at 2,000.
Only once before in Chicago's history
has today's heat record been exceeded.
That was on July 21, 1901, when the of

TO ASK PROBE
OF EXPLOSION
Congress Will Call for Investi
gation of New York
Disaster.
By ANDREW R. KELLEY.
That Congress will ask for an official
investigation to fix the cause of the New
York explosion developed last night.
Representative Meyer London. of New
York, announced that he would intro
duce a resolution In the House on Wed
nesday calling for an investigation by
agents of the Department of Justict to
determine the responsibility for the dis
aster.
Members of the Senate were eager for
further details before promising action
in the Senate, but the suspicion that sur
rounds the cause of the disaster makes
It certain that it will be brought up
when the Senate meets today.
Secret Service agents in New York and
vicinity were at work on the case yes
terday.
The fact that munitions intended for
the allies figured In the disaster, has
roused considerable suspicion. It has
been common knowledge that the muni
tions manufacturers have received scores
of threats and agents of the Department
of Justice have long been active in an
cffort to trace these arorymous threats.
Information late last night was to the
effect that the owners of the powder
barges believed Ekat an unauthorized
barge tied up alongside of the munitions
scows was the direct cause of the dis
aster.
Ilowever, the air was alive with ru
mnrs of the presence of rmysterious men
before and after the explosion, and only
a thorough investigation will clear these
up, in the opinion of many members of
Congress.
