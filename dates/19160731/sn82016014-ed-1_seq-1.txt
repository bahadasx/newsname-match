HOT, STICKY NIGHT
Most Uncomfortable Period
Here In Many Tears.
Freak Rains In City Cooler
; Weather Tonight.
Last night was probably" the most
uncomfortable' night, according to S.
D. Flora, local weather observer, that
Topeka has ever experienced. The
minimum temperature reading was 76
degrees and the wind amounted prac
tically to nothing. Only one othor
night In the thirty years that the local
records have been kept might rival
last night. There have been nights
with higher temperatures but none,
with the possible exception of the one
mentioned, that was more unpleasant.
The night was the warmest this year,
following a day that lacked only a
fraction of a degree of being the hot
test day this year. The highest read
ing Sunday was 99 degrees.
An unusual rain occurred last night
and was repeated this morning. A
rather heavy, shower fell about 10
o'clock in the south part of the city
and this morning a rain measuring
.12 of an inch was recorded at the
weather bureau. Rain fell in North
Topeka this morning also. The show
er extended west only as far as Tay

STOP ROCK ISLAND
Union Pacific Would Have Own
K. C.-Topeka Service.
In Federal Court to Keep Trains
Off Their Tracks.
Des Moines, la., July 31. Suit filed
In federal court here today by the
Union Pacific railway asks that the
Rock Island be enjoined from use of
the Union Pacific tracks from Kansas
City, Mo., to Topeka, Kan. The Union
Pacific says the Rock Island inherited
use of the tracks by the purchase of
the old Chicago, Kansas & Nebraska
line under an agreement made be
tween the C, K. & N. and the Union
Pacific thirty years ago. Under the
agreement the C, K. & N. could use
the tracks between Kansas City. Mo.,
and Topeka. but could not take on

Rock Island is building a depot at
Kansas City, Kan., with the intention
of doing a passenger and freight busi
ness between the two points.
ROCK ISLAND UNION PAC.
Today's Suit a Very Important One to
the Roads.
C. A. Magaw, attorney for the Union
Pacific .railroad here, said today the
entire controversy, between the Union
Pacific and Rock Island, over whether
or not the Rock Island shall be allow
ed to take on and discharge passen
gers at the Armstrong station, Kansas
City, Kan., under the present 99-year
lease of the Rock Island of the tracks
between here and Kansas City, will
hinge on the suit filed today. The suit
filed in Federal courts in Omaha sev
eral months ago by the Union Pacific
to keep the Rock Island from taking
on and letting off passengers In Kan
sas City. Kan., will be dismissed.
The suit brought by the Rock Island
to enjoin the Union Pacific from tak
ing any action which would in any
way interfere with the Rock Island's
pa&senger business at the Armstrong
station and filed in Kansas City will
also be dismissed. Mr. Magaw said
the case would be hinged entirely on
the Des Moines suit.
It is thought in Topeka that the con
troversy may end in the Rock Island
building Its own tracks between To
peka and Kansas City after the Rock
Island has been reorganized. That, of
course, would be in event the result

ractory. ;
Mr. Magaw said today the Union
Pacific is making no attempt to

3 DAYSJO LIVE
Sir Roger Casement Will Be
Executed Thursday Morning.
Only Royal Prerogative Can
Save Irish Patriot How.
LITTLE' HOPE FOR THIS
Two Guards Watch Over Pris
oner In His Death Cell.
Only Priest Is Allowed to See
Him Privately. ;'
London, July 81. Should the loyal
prerogative not be exercised, Sir R on
er Casement will suffer the extreme
penalty of the law in Pentonville
prison next Thursday morning.
The hour of his execution will proo-
ably be 8 o'clock, or 2 o'clock, New
York time. Candidly, those who have
been following the drama are not san
guine regarding a reprieve for the
prisoner, but It would not be fair to
say there ia no hope. There is a
little.
The correspondent does not think he
is betraying a confidence when he
states that Casement himself from the
first has believed that he will be hung.
In fact, he has not personally petition
ed for a reprieve nor will he . do so.
It is understood that his health is very
good and that he Is quite resigned to
his fate.
Kept In Death Cell.
It . is not expected that a decision
will be announced before Tuesday, al
though they come today. Sir Roger us
confined In the condemned cell in Pen
tonville. This cell was last occupied
by Smith, the notorious bigamist and
wife murderer, who was executed in
connection with what was known as
the "brides in bath" case. It is a
commodious room on the ground floor
or the prison and is furnished with
an ordinary plank, a bed with sewed
blankets, a small table, a stool, wash
basin and bcok rack. - -r
Here the prisoner spends the great
er part of his day and night. Litera
ture he can obtain from the prison
library, also writing -material. All his
letters, however, are - seen by the
prison governor both those written
by him and to him. The cell is quite
close to the scene of execution. , As to
his life Itself, one day follows another
in its monotony. .
Kept on Water Wagon;
His meals he has regularly ordered
by a medical officer. He has prac
tically a. carta blanche f rasa. the ,
hospital menu chicken and soup, tal
lies and a fruit, and even some ehtiiee
grapes. He is allowed to smoke a pipe
and tobacco is provided him ad lib,,
but he must ask the warden for light
to ignite it. Intoxicants are- not al
lowed. Should he express want for
anything, either the warden or the as
sistant - wardens there are, two on
duty and he never is-left alone for a
moment -will try ito . carry out his
wish. . i
With the ring of the prison bell
Casement has breakfast. His dinner
and tea he takes at the same time as
the other inmates of the prison. The
only time during which he is permit
ted to be beyond the watchful ey of
his keepers is when he is visited by the
priest. Such conversations are con
ducted in strict privacy.
Gets Regular Exercise.
Otherwise, when he is visited bv hia
lawyer, relatives or friends, he is
taken into an adjoining room and
there he is allowed to be seated at
one end of a long table with the
visitor at the other end. The warden
sits in the center. One visitor Is daily
aiiowea.
It will be seen that Sir Roger's
bodily comfort Is not neglected and as
the close confinement has a depressing
effect, he frequently turns to outside
exercises arranged for him. Occasions
are selected for this air when all other
prisoners are confined to their cells.
A BIG NEWS CENTER
Topeka Now Recognized as a Most
Important Point.
Topeka is becoming of great import
ance as a news center. A year ago
the ' Associated Press established - a
bureau here and last week it establish

BIG FIGHT FOR
THREE OFFICES
IN THISCOUNTY
Last Bay of Bitter Local Cam
paign for the Primary.
Contest for Sheriff Most Spec
tacular In Years.
TAKE ONLY 3.500 TO NOMINATE
Vote Is Well 'Divided Among
Nine Candidates.
County Attorney and Clerk
Fight Means Close Finish.
Today, the last day of the cam
paign, local interest centers around the
candidates in contests for three coun
ty offices sheriff, county clerk and
county attorney. , It has been years
since there was such a fight as has
been and is being made for these three
offices.
Perhaps the fight for sheriff is the
most' spectacular and most uncertain.
There are nine Republican candidates
for the office and every man has been
burning up his energy and that of his
friends to put him in first place. The
nine candidates are Hugh Larimer,
now undersheriff; H. A. Hodglns, J. E.
Wilson, G. W. Betts, R. W. Eaton, H.
C. Ericsson, George Frost, W. T. Daw
mon, B. H. Shore.
- The probabilities are that 3,600 for
ny one candidate will nominate him.
Every candidate claims to have that
many or more votes in his vest pocket
It is doubtful if there is a voter in
Shawnee- -county who has - not been
seen by one or more of the candidates
for sheriff.
There are only two candidates for
county attorney and they have staged
the neatest fight that has been put up
locally during the present campaign.
tiooert uarver ana w. P. Montgomery
are the two- candidates. - Both are
young men and both ambitious. Car
ver has served as judge of the court
of Topeka and is now serving as first
assistant in the office of the county
attorney. Montgomery has served in
the office of the attorney general for
six years. Thev have made a neck
and neck campaign for five weeks-
Tho Omnty Clerk Baoe.
There are four candidates for
t- clerk Wllber Galloway, Kenneth
tauD, jonn Wright and H. I. Monroe.
Raub has served as deDutv dnrine the
administration of O. K. Swayze.
Wright is first deputy in the same of
fice and has done much of the real
work for '-years. Monroe-is employed
in the office of the county assessor.
Galloway is an outsider and has never
held a public office.- He did not enter
the campaign until the day the time
for filing petitions expired.
Another fight in which there is
more or less interest la that for clerk
of the district court. A woman and a
man are making a campaign for it.
Mary E. Chapin, a widow employed
for several years in the office of tho
probate Judge, and Will Harris, for
years an employe of the Santa Fe, are
the candidates. - For weeks Mrs.
Chapin had all the best of it. Within
the last two weeks friends of Harris
at the Santa Fe general office building
have been putting time and money
into his campaign and have made in
roads on Mrs. Chapin's strength.
Nothing to Worry About.
There is just one candidate for a
county office who has nothing to
worry about. That is Douglas Gra
ham, clerk of the court of Topeka. He
secured the nomination two years ago
after a hard fight. This year there is
not a candidate against him for the
nomination and as- the Democrats
failed to put a candidate for that place
on their ticket he will have no opposi
tion at the general election that is,
unless there should be an independent
candidate brought out.
Ralph Gaw and D. H. Branaman
are attracting considerable attention to
the nomination for probate judge.
Both men have covered city and coun
try thoroughly and today both ex
pressed themselves as being confident
of the result.
There are eight candidates for mar
shal of the court of Topeka and in
have covered everything in town with
their cards but there is no one, except
the candidates, who is willing to p-e-dlct
the result of the fight.
W. F. Schoch and James A. Trout
man are fighting it out over the nomi
nation for state senator. Schocn
served two terms as probate judge and
Troutman is now state senator from
Shawnee county. They have made
their campaigns but they have not
been anything like as intense as those
of other men who are fighting over
some of the county offices.
OFFER PARDONED
CONVICT OLD JOB
AS POLICE CHIEF
Macon, Ga., July SI. Thomas Ed
gar Stripling, who for nearly four
years, while an escaped convict from
Georgia, served as chief of police at

brought back to Georgia to complete
his term.
NAKED SWIMMERS
TAKEN IN BARRELS
TO POLICE COURT
Indiana Harbor, Ind., July 31.
When four Rumanians, clad only in
smiles, appeared at the local beach
there was a wild rush for the shore
by women and girls.
The police wrapped the , offending
four In barrels and took them to the
station, where they explained they
were recent arrivals in America and
that in Rumania men and women al
ways went bathing together with no
thought of apparel.

SCORCHJJBERTY
Famous Statue in N. Y. Harbor
Damaged by Blast.
However, Made Miraculous Es-
cape During Catastrophe.
New York, July SI. Miss Liberty's
gown was torn a little and some of
her. skin punctured by shrapnel bul
lets but the famous statue on Bed
loe Island today was found to be sur
prisingly free from injury, consider
ing Its location less than a mile from
Black Tom peninsula. Many freak
ish incidents were reported here and
elsewhere.
The main door giving entrance to
the Statue of Liberty was wrenched
off its hinges as by a giant hand; the
iron cover to a powder magazine was
torn away, all doors were crushed in
and probably a hundred bolts joining
tne piaies wnicn compose the giant
figure were broken or sheared off.
A number of angle bars were twisted.
It was some caprice of the explosion
forces that left the giant figure un
touched. John D. Thought It Earthquake.
There were lots of other freakish
stunts which the explosive forcss t,d
in ana around Mew York and lots of
freakish things which people did un
der the stress of excitement. Here are
a few:
John ' D. Rockefeller, up at Pocan -tico
Hills, was awakened by rhe ex
plosion, got up and tried to and out
where the "earthquake" was located.
Policeman Henry Doherty, patrol
ling the waterfront, ' in Jersey City,
found himself in the water, with every
stitch of his clothing stripped from
him except a sort of breech clout.
Charles Cutler, barge man was hurl
ed high into the air and landed safely
and softly in a car of borax.
Shower of Overcoats.
Immigants' at Ellis Island were
thankful for what was apparently a
rain of heay sheepskin -lined over
coats. Nobody knows where they
came from.
Not a solitary window in the twelve
story building occupied by the New
York Plate Glass Insurance company,
which will have to pay millions in in

Assessed valuation of Kansas prop
erty both real and personal has In
creased approximately 196,602,882
over 1915, bringing the property valu
ation of the state to S2.981,22S,982,
according to a statement today by the
state tax commission. It is probable
that the state tax levy will this year
go to 1.S5 mills, an increase of one-
tenth of a mill over last year anu an
Increase of .15 mills over 1914, when
the state valuation was $176,418,8u
below the 1916 showing. Virtually
four million dollars must be raised by
the state under the 1916 leavy.
ReDorts today by the state tax com
mission show that increases in real
estate valuations have been made by
the state board of equalization. In
addition to the arbitrary increases, lo
cal assessors returned increases in
nearly fifty more of the 105 counties
of the state. The state tax commis
sion, sitting as a board of equalisation.
increased unimproved farm lanos in
Shawnee county 5 per cent. The In
crease means a boos of 8828,176 in
Shawnee county farm valuations. The
greatest increase by the state board
was in Sedgwick county, which was
compelled to meet an Increase of $3,
769,775 in the assessors' returns.
Both unimproved farm lands and im
proved Wichita, property were boosted.
Levy V1U Go Up.
With an increase of more than 176
million dollars in property valuations
in two years, Kansas must this year
meet another Increase in the tax levy,
regardless of the recent years of
preaching of economy, efficiency and
business administration before the
Kansas voters. Both the valuation
and levy will go up this year, was the
admission today in offices of the com
mission. - -
During the years 1912-18-14, the
state levy remained stationary at 1.20
mills. At that time the state prop
erty valuation hung languidly over the
$2,800,000,000 mark. Now the valua
tion is three billion dollars in round
figures.
In 1914 the last year of the 1.20
mill levy the assessed valuation was
82,804,810,092. In 1915 the state made
a gain of $79,816,608 in its valuation.
That year the valuation went to $2,
884,626,600. That same year the levy
was increased to 1.25 mills on the
dollar valuation. This year with an
increase of approximately 896,602,382
in valuations, or a total state valuation
of $2,981,228,982, another increase is
certain. Advance dope today on the
1916 levy was to the effect that .the
state would probably be required to
make an even greater increase in the
levy than in 1915. Such conditions
will probably result In an increase of
one-tenth of a mill over last year, or a
levy of 1.35 mills
Gave It Another Boost.
Local assessors this year increased
their valuation returns $57,'0i!.i;2
over total returns for 1915. The state
tax commission, sitting as a state
board of equalization, added $33,b45,
990 to the valuations in Increases in
fifty counties. These increases ranged
from $78,911 in Smith county io
769,776 in Sedgwick county.

Chicago, July $1. Chicago and the
middle west figuratively faced the
weather stage and awaited the prom
ised boon of cooler weather today,
meanwhile anxiously hoping tonight
would witness the final curtain In the
grim drama of death and suffering

bureau have promised lower tempera
tures by tomorrow at the latest.

the most part slept out of doors
again last night. The numerous parks
of the city were vast sleeDlng anart-

of rich and poor alike, furnished com
fort to thousands of bathers as late as
midnight. On many of the beaches
the regulations were forgotten.
The high mortality among Infants

of the situation. Upwards of fifty
babies were reported -to- have suc
cumbed to the heat during yesterday.
