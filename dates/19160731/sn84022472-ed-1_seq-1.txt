Is only 13 feet wide. The commissioners-
said they had no Jurisdiction
in the matter of widening the road.
So this matter may be brought up at

Dr. B. W. White of this city was
the leading petitioners. He said the
road was dangerous at tne narrow
point. "If you come up and become
a voter in Trumbull," said Selectman
Shelton to Dr. White, "perhaps then
they would vote to have the road re
paired." The selectman said no com
plaint could be made now about the
condition of the road.
Two ether petitions for road repairs
were -received. One of these was
headed by A. C. Whiting who wants
the Daniels Farm road in Trumbull
repaired. J. N. Whiting heads the
other petition which asks that the
road in the Long Hill district leading
