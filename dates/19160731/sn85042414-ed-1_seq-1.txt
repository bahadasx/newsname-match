Great Property Loss.
New York, July 31— Property loss
estimated at $26,000,000 was caused
yesterday by a series of terrific
plosions of ammunition awaiting ship'
ment to the entente allies and stored
on Black Tom island, a' small strip of
land jutting into New York bay off
Jersey City.
The loss'of life still was problema
tical last night. It will not be deter
mined definitely until there has been
opportunity to check up the workmen
•employed on the island and on boats
moored nearby.
i£J.
Two are known to be dead and at
least two more are missing. Scores
of persons were Injured, some of them
probably mortally.
The detonations, which were felt in
five states, began with a continuous
rapid fire of small shelly, .the blowing
up of great quantities' of dynamite.

Tire that started soon after the
ftiwgreat .crash which spread death
and desolation in its wake, destroyed
thirteen of the huge warehouses of
the National Storage company on
Black Tom Island in which were stor
ed merchandise valued between $12,
000,000 and $15,,000,000. The flames,
shooting into the clouds, were reflect
ed against New York's skyline of tow
ering office buildings, which only a
few moments before were shaken to
their foundations by an earthquake.
Miles of streets in Manhattan alone
were strewn with broken glass and
shattered signs.
Early reports of heavy loss of life
were impossible of verification, and
the authorities asserted the number
of deaths probably will be small. It
was said that owing to the extent of
the wreckage. It might be several days
before the exact figures could be ob
tained.
The cause of the disaster had not
been determined last night. Officials
of the National Storage company and
the Lehigh' Valley railroad which also
suffered heavily through loss of pro
perty, declared, however, that reports
to them showed a lire started shortly
after 1 o'olock yesterday morning -on
a barge belonging to an independent
"towing company that had been moor
ed alongside a dock used by the rail-
Toad company to transfer ammunition
shipments from trains to vessels in
the harbor.
Investigating Affair.
The barge, it was said, was there
without authority- either of the rail
road or 'the storage company. The
officials refused to disclose the name
of the independent towing company
saying they were investigating "to
ascertain whether the barge purposely
had been set on fire .as the result of a
plot."
First reports that more than thirty
persons had been killed proved .er
roneous. The Jersey City police'said
at noon that all the firemen had been
accounted for, that Cornelius Leyden,
chief of the Lehigh Valley railroad
police, and several men who had been
employed as guards were missing, and
one. child had succumbed from shock.
About sixty persons were in hospitals,
several of whom may die.
There were two. explosions. The

yesterday morning, one hour after
firemen began fighting a blase which

FIRE, SAY REPORTS
Berlin, July 31.—(Via Sayvllle.)—
Reports of a 'great conflagration at
Petrograd, in which a' bridge across
the river'Nevaa, twelve large steamers
including several trans-Atlantic liners,
and the Putiloff gun works and other
establishments were destroyed, are
printed in the Lokal Anzeiger.
In its account of the fire, the news
paper says:
"On Tuesday, the wooden palace
bridge across the Nevaa took fire at
several places. Immediately flaming
pontoons drifting to Vassili Ostrov,
(Basil islands), where a huge fire
broke out, and also to the port where
twelve large steamers, including sev
eral trans-Atlantic lines, a floating
dock, the Putiloff works and other es
tablishments took fire.
"The police suspect that the con
flagration was the work of anarchists
who planned to burn all public build
ings being used for military pur
poses."
Vassili Ostrov, or Basil island, con
tains the most important insular sec
tion of the Russian capital. The part
of the island facing the admiralty

The scope and effect of the policy are
extraordinary. British steamship com
panies will not accept cargoes from
the proscribed firms or persons or
transport their goods to any port and
steamship lines under neutral owner
ship understand that if they accept
freight from them they are likely to
be denied coal at British ports "and
excluded from 'other privileges which
they have usually enjoyed, and may

Neutral bankers refuse to answer to
those on the list and neutral mer
chants decline to contract for their
goods, fearing a like proscription. It
appears that British officials regard
the prohibitions of the blacklist as
applicable to domestic commercial
transaction^ in foreign countries as
well as in Great Britain and her de

put on notice that their dealings with
blacklisted firms are to be regarded

Entente Prospects Brighter.
London, July 31.—The opening of
the present week -finds the prospects
of the- entente, allies perhaps brighter
than in any previous period of the
war according to the views held here,
and the position .of th'e' Central pow
ers more discouraging. General
Brussiloffs striking victories present
the German general staff with the im
perative problem of how to re-inforce
the eastern front since General von
Linsinden, who was sent by the Ger
mans to aid the shattered Austriano,
now has been completely thrust back
from the Lutsk salient.
But the same problem is presented
on the western front where, says an
unofficial correspondent, "the cease
less battle seems steadily to gain In
tensity." "Doubtless the constant ar
rival of fresh German troops and
guns." he adds, "has every thing to
do with this result. The enemy shows
an increasing tendency to counter
attack."
These counter-attacks have failed
to stem the steady entente allied ad
vance and although at the present
moment the fighting on the Somme is
mainly devoted to seeking mastery of
small strategic positions which will
be the keys to further progress, there
is yet no sign of Germany making any
effective counter offensive-
The Russians remarkable victories
reveal a most interesting situation.
The army of the German general.
Count von Bothmer holding the
the Lemberg-Larnopol
str,Pa
near
firms, and corporations in the United railroad was a few weeks ago being
outflanked on the south by General
Letchitzky's successful advance when
the Dniester floods prevented Leti
echtsky's further progress. This
failed von Bothmer to hold on to the
threatened positions. General Sakah
roflf then devoted himself to envelop
ing von Bothmer's force in the north
with what success is seen in his
doubtful victory west of Lutsk and
Brody.
Thus outflanked north and south it
is considered impossible that Count
von Bothmer can longer delay extri
cating himself from his precarious
position, when he now can do so
without serious losses. The Russians
at Brody are at present nearer Lem»
berg than von Bothmer's forces,
which are entrusted with Lemberg's
defense, and although the country
between Brody and Lemberg is very
difficult, it becomes a question wheth
er the evacuation of both Kovel and
Lemberg will not soon become neces
sary.
