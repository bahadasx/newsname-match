By Associated Press
New York. July 31. Two men are
under arrest to-day on warrants charg
ing them with manslaughter in in
directly causing the death of one of
the victims of the terrific explosion of
ammunition on Black Tom pier early
yesterday morning. Estimates of the
casualties early to-day placed the
number of dead at four, with three
others mortally injured. 35 suffering
from less serious injuries and eleven
to twenty missing. Estimates of the
property loss range from $25,000,000
to $45,000,000.
Many persons who were on board
barges moored at the burned piers are
missing and it is feared that they
have perished. In some quarters it
was believed the total number of dead
would reach 12.
Will Demand Congressional Probe
While federal and county prosecu
tors and the Interstate Commerce
Commission were conducting investi
gations to determine the cause of and
fix the responsibility for the great am
munition explosion in Jersey City yes
terday morning with its toll of death,
injury and destruction, Mayor Mark
Fagan, of Jersey City, announced that
he would demand a congressional in
vestigation of the disaster. He said
that such an investigation was im
perative in order to enact more strin
gent laws for the transportation and
storage of high explosives than are
provided in the present regulations of
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The Mayor asserted that the State
of New Jersey, although it had strin
gent laws governing the transporta
tion of explosives within the State, was
at the mercy of the federal laws to
■which the Jersey authorities have
been obliged to conform in order to
permit inter-state commerce. The In
terstate Commerce Commission regu
lations, he said, allowed the transpor
tation and storage of high explosives
in quantities far too large.
"I have already requested three Xew
Jersey Congressmen to take steps to
bring about an investigation." he said.
"It seems unnatural that such a catas
trophe could occur in a civilized com
munity."
Those under arrest were Albert M.
Dickman, agent of the Lehigh Valley
railroad, stationed at Black Tom pier,
and Alexander Davidson, superinten
dent of the warehouses of the Nation
al Storage Company. 13 of which were

destroyed by the fire which followed
the explosions. A warrant was issued
for the arrest of Theodore B. Johnson,
president of a lightering company, one
of whose barges loaded with ammuni
tion is alleged to have been moored at
the pier.
Cause Undetermined
Frank Hague, commissioner of pub
lic safety of Jersey City, charged that
the blame of the explosion lay with
either the Lehigh Valley Railroad
Company, the storage company or the
lighterage company, and that some of
them had violated the laws of New
Jersey, the Jersey City ordinances and
the rules of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, by permitting barges
loaded with explosives to remain moor
ed at the piers overnight. These
barges were being used to transport
the ammunition to steamers lying in
Gravesend Bay.
The Jersey City police to-day added
to the list of dead, Cornelius J. Leyden,
chief of the Lehigh Valley railroad po
lice, who has been missing since the
explosion occurred.
At least , $10,000,000, probably $15,-
000,000 damage was caused by the de
struction of thirteen of the eighteen
warehouses of the National Storage
Company in Jersey City, Edmund L.

Federal Agents Begin
Probe of Explosion
By Associated Press
Washington, July 31. lnvestig
ations of the great explosion in New-
York harbor to learn if it was the
result of violation or the federal law
were begun to-day by the Department
of Justice and the Interstate Com
merce Commission, through their
agents in New York.
The inquiries at first will be inform
al and designed only to determine if
either department has jurisdiction in
the case. If it develops that either
regulations of commerce or the neu
trality laws have been violated, the
government then will begin extended
investigation into the facts leading up
to the explosion.
Shock of Explosion Felt
in This Part of State
The first intimation in Harrisburg
that somewhere a terrific explosion
had occurred was given when a Camp
Hill man called Gorgas drug store
about 2.20 yesterday morning, inquir
ing whether anything had been blown
up in this city. About the same time
another man, a Middletown resident,
called and asked the same question.
Both said they felt distinct shocks.
The operators at the Western Union
Telegraph office were asked if they
had word of any explosion and the
telegraphers becan making inquiries
over the wire. Operators on the New
York circuit told the Harrisburg men
that a terrific explosion had occurred
somewhere near by, but at that hour
they were unable to say just where.
The Xew York operators said all the
windows had been broken in their
building.
Cottagers coming in from Perdix,
the Cove and other points along the
river this morning said they had been
awakened in some strange way about
2.15 yesterday morning with a feeling
that their little bungalows were rock
ing on their posts.
Commenting on reports that yes
terday's explosion at New York was
felt here. Professor Percy L. Grubb,
instructor of geclogy of the Technical
high school faculty, declared this after
noon that such a terrific detonation
would have much the same effect as
an earthquake.
"A terrific explosion such as the
one yesterday," said Professor Grubb,
"would cause much the same kind of
a tremor on the earth's surface as an
earthquake. The shock would spread
out in concentric circles, with the rock
strata as conductors, and would cause
the earth's crust to tremble for a great
distance."
