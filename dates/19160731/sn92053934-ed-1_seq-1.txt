Opposing Forces Battle on
Despite Torrid Temper
ature on Field.
London. July 31, (2:3. p. m.)
,4s the result of local encounters In
the retrion of the river Somme, the
British troops last night advanced
their posts at some points on the
plateau to the north of the town of
Babentin Le Petit, it was officially
announced this afternoon.
Paris, July 31. North of the Pomme
yesterday afternoon ami last night the
Germans redoubled their counter at
tacks between Hem wood and Monacu
farm, says the official statement issued
this afternoon by the French war de
partment. The struggle was especially
severe around Monacu farm where the
Germans got a footing for a moment
but were immediately driven back.
Deny British Gain.
Berlin. July 31, (via London, 3 p. m.)
Anglo-French troops in their attack
Sunday against the German positions
in the region of the river Somme did
not gain a foot of ground, according to
tie German army headquarters staff in
its statement today.
Fight in Great Heat.
With the British Army in the Field,
July ".0 (via London, July 31, 4:45 a.
m.t French and British soldiers made
today's attack in sweltering mid-summer
heat. The first real hot wave of
the season struck northern France
last Eight and this morning British
and French infantry'' cooperated in an
act'.n north of the Somme in front of
Guillemont and Maurepas.
For the last few days the one word
on everybody's tongue has been visi
bility, -which has come into universal
use since Admiral Jellico's first fleet
dispatch.
Formerlv artillerymen spoke of good
and bad light. Persistent bad light or
low risibility, -which did not permit
the gunners to register their targets,
had delaved any important infantry
action. Yesterday the light became
better as the heat grew tropic and of
fensive operations were renewed.
Germans Increase. Numbers.
Every day the Germans have been
increasing the number of guns and
men in the Guillemont sector, which is
among the last portions of high ground
they hold. By prisoners taken 10 Ger
man battalions, or 10,000 men, have
been identified on a front of 2,000
yards, where the Germans are still in
their old second line fortifications.
The Germans appear to regard this
sector of critical importance, since the
British broke the second line on the
adjoining front of two miles on July
14.
Capture Railroad Station.
The British got possession of the
railroad station, which they had reach
ed in a previous attack. Some of the
attackers got into Guillemont and
reached the church, where the Ger
mans, swarming in dugouts, outnum
bered the advance party which fought
against their foe on all sides. It was
one of those hand-to-hand and hld-and-seek
conflicts in the village ruins
of indescribable ferocity. The Brit
ish had to retire from the edge of
Guillemont, but made a considerable
advance southward on the flank of the
town where, through the hot night,
fighting continued to maintain theif
gain.
Teutons Suffer Rig Losses
Perspiration, made white water
courses in the dust of the men's faces
and their eyes looked out through
masks so thick that their faces seem
ed covered with some kind of armor.
Motor trucks passed like phantoms in
thick clouds on the road. Gunners,
strippf ri to the skin, kept on serving
their jruns at top spcd.
Soldiers who reached Guillemont
spak of the fearful carnage among
the Germans from the British gun fire,
owing to the masses of Germans con
centrated under the British bombard
ment before the infantry attacks.
With the news of the shooting of
Captain Fryatt fresh in their minds,
the British went into the charge in a
fury, swearing they would avenge his
murder.
At Hem wood all the German as
saults were repulsed by French coun
ter attacks. French batteries on the
left bank of the Somme, the statement
continues, enfiladed the German troops,
Inflicting great loss.
"On the left bank of the Meuse, in
the Verdun sector, a German attack
on the northeast side of Hill 304 failed.
MOn the right bank of the Meuse the
French progressed slightly in the reg
ion Eouthwe&t of Fleury.

Pope Admits
His Failure
to Stop War
Rome, via Paris, July 31 (10 a. m.)
Failure of the pope's appeals to the
warring nations for peace was admit
ted by the pontiff in addressing a del
egation of the youth of Rome yester
day. The delegation prayed for peace
in accordance with the pope's appeal
to God on the last Sunday of the sec
ond year of the struggle to end the
war.
The popes aid the war, which was
ravaging all the earth, was not visi
ble on all faces, although such car
nage made an ever-present call for
mediation and patience. Yet, he said,
adults were unable to forego the at
tractions of life, and that was why he
turned to the children, who are near
est and dearest to God by their inno
cence and weakness.
-We, the father of all the faithful,"
he said, "have suffered, were exhorted
! and prayed for two years, but our ex
hortations to the combatants to lay
down their arms and seek a settle
ment through the channels of justice
and reason have been in vain; se we
decided to have recourse to invoca
tions to divine help by the all-powerful
means of your innocence, hoping
that the prodigy of the son of Hagar
might be renewed."

Chicago, July 31. Chicago and the
middle west today awaited the drop in
temperature promised by tomorrow at
the latest, which was expected to
break the long heat spell.
It was said at the weather bureau
that the cool wave would be felt in
Chicago possibly by tonight at 7
o'clock and that by daylight tomorrow
morning it will be pleasant.
The government temperature at 7
o'clock this morning was 82 degrees,
three degrees lower than on Saturday
morning at the same time. Brisk winds
gave added relief.
Chicago, after yesterday's sad spec
tacle of 115 deaths attributed to the
heat and more than 400 prostrations,
lor the most part slept out doors again
last night. Parks were crowded. More
than 180,000 persons spent yesterday
and last night in Lake Michigan.
The record breaking death rate of
the last week has seriously tested the
facilities of the coroner's office, whila
the prostrations have taxed the local
hospitals and burdened the city's pro
vision to the limit. Upwards of fifty
babies succumbed to the heat, yester
day. Among animals the death rate
has almost established a new record.
Dead horses were reported lying along
the streets in many sections of the
city.
. "Relief from the torrid temperature
was felt today over the country west
of Chicago as far as he Rocky moun
tains and north of a line drawn through
northern Iowa. The cool wave grad
ually moved south today and is expect
ed to reach central Illinois this after
noon or tomorrow, though the drop in
temperature is not expected to equal
that here or in" "the north. In some
points in southern Illinois and its lati
tude, the temperature is likely to re
main slightly above normal, it is pre
dicted. While the extreme heat in Chicago
lasted about three weeks, in the plains
states generally, it reigned about a
month.

the blame of the explosion lay with
either the Lehigh Valley railroad
company, the storage company or tho
lighterage company and that some of
them had violated the laws of New

the rules of the interstate commerce
commission by permitting barges load
ed with explosives to remain moored
at the piers overnight. These barges
were being used to transport the am
munition to steamers lying in Grave

of Liberty is today a mass of smoking
ruins. Work of repairing the damage
to the buildings on Bedloes and Ellis
islands and in New York and Jersey
City began this morning. The immi
gration station at Ellis island had the
appearance of a war swept villag-i
with every window shattered, the roof
of the hospital caved in, the main door
blown away and the dining and execu
tive rooms wrecked, while the island
was strewn with bits of shrapnel,
broken glass and three-inch Bhell j
thrown ashore from drifting barge3
which had bombarded the Island as
they burned. The damage was esti
mated at $75,000.
The buildings on Bedloe's island,
with doors blown in and .windows
shattered, showed the marks of an
eight-hour bombardment of shrapnel,
iron bolts and spikes, pieces of steel
and chains. The loss there is esti
mated at $100,000. The Statue of Lib
erty virtually is undamaged but tho
doors to the pedestal are blown id.
Have Miraculous Escapes.
Stories told by those who narrowly
escaped death verged on tho mirac
ulous. One man says he was blown
off a lighter into the bay and swam to
Bedloe's island, but had to swim ba.ck
again to the Jersey shore when tho
flaming barges bombarded the island.
"The air seemed to be full of flame and
I thought the end of the world had
come," said another survivor. A third
was blown 50 feet from the top of a
freight car and landed near a building
which fell upon him.
The Jersey City police today added
to the list of dead Cornelius J. Ley
den, chief of the Lehigh Valley rail
road police, who has been missing
since the explosion occurred.
Warehouses Destroyed.
