HOW rr FEELS TO DANGLE
HE'S FEET Di THE CLOUDS
FAR ABOVE SECOND AVE.
By Cornelia GUm
EVERY small boy and every small girl in the world, 1 suppose, has dreamed
a wonderful dream of stepping off cf something high, waving his or Jjer arms
a bit, and floating out Into spice tike the birds.
I know I used to. One time I tried it. All that I accomplished was a broken
ankle. I decided then that flving was one of the dreams that never come true.
Then, Saturday, 1 found that it could, tho waving my arms had nothing what
ever to do with it.
I went over to Harbor Island to a big, round, white tent in the midst of a
long field of sand and met Mr. Terah Maroney and his aeroplane.
Mr. Maroney was working around his mechanical bird, tightening a screw here,
loosening another there, testing the engine and tapping the iron rods that hold the
wings in place.
It seems that when one flies one has to be especially attired in overalls, tied
tightly at the ankles, and buttoned high aabout the chin. Also one wears goggles
and a cap over one's hair.
When I was all ready, Mr. Maroney and. his assistants raised one side of the
tent and slid the machine out onto the "field, it glides very easily on its rubber
tired wheels.
Thev started the big propeller to whirling. Mr. Maroney slipped into the little
iron driver's nest behind the wheel and rushed off on the trial trip he always takes
before he carries a passenger.
All the while he was sailing and whirling and div
the bystanders talked to me pityingly.
Soma to auftuaae me iron .
the flight Other* gave me much I
advice an to whJ t to do and how I
waft going to f-'-l. from the depth
of the wtftdom they had gained in
standing on the ground and watch
log.
When th»> machine had again
come to rest on the field before
the tent. I scrauibl' <1 "P onto the
bottom plane. Just behind the driv
er-* neat, and thev strapped me
there. ~
Some one gav» the propeller n
twist, and the great bird began to
vibrate gently.
Gats Plenty of Advice
The last thing I heard »»« a
final admonition from a tall pest.l
mist, who had bren mo«t dubious
about our return ..
"Take a lungful of air with >ou,
he Shouted It II be the last you'll
for—"
The amld«n roar of the engine
swallowed up fcli other -ound. anil
we were gliding along the ground.
Mr Maronev turned his heail.
and his lips formed the words.
"Pont worry!"
1 couldn't hear a thing »bo\-

Rise In Long Circles
As we rose in long, easy circles,
the earth seemed to be drifting
gradually fway from us. Our
perspective IncreriKed The sweep
of the Sound and the cltv came
Into the picture, then the lakes
nnd the mountain ! beyond them. In

fierce sort of Joy to tig again «'

Talks With Hl* Left Hand
Occasionally Mr. Maronev would
turn around and talk 'o me wl'li
hla lett hand, pointing out our bird
like shadow far below us on the
ground, or 'ndicit'.ng with his fin
gers the number of hundreds of
feet we had risen,
Five hundred feet —'i.r.d every
thing was perfect In Its <'et*ll!
I could see t.ie people on th*
j field from vhich we were rising
I could see men moving about on
the docks, and directly under me
oue man In a rowhoat on the bay
Boat Looks Like Toy
Higher and higher we rose. Mr.
Maroney lifted the fingers of his
left hand three times
Fifteen hundred feet!
Three times the height of the
Smith building tower!
I could still see the man In the
: rowhoat. but his boat was a tov
| hewn from s chip now, and he was
a speck In the center of It.
A long cruiser farther out
In the harbor was like one of a
! w hole fleet I had received for
Christmas several years ago.
The city w af a painted city, a city
<if blocks of cunning workmanship.
The world was my plaything,
spread out for me to take or leave.
Haa Feeling of Confidence
The wind rushing against my
fare, the glorious, sunlit world br
low stretching one way into the
gleaming blue of the WBter and the
other Into the gtay mist of the
hills, all brought that wonderful
j feeling of inspiration, of ability
| to accomplish anything, that surges
In one sometimes at music from an
organ.
Oradually we sank.
The earth drifted nearer.
The hewn chip again became a
i row-boat and the speck a man.
The painted city became alive,
with humans moving on Its streets.
I could see the round, white tent
and the people In front of It.
The wind lessened its rush
against my face.
We struck the aand and glid
ed acroaa It with ever-decreas-
Ing apeed.
Then the great bird came to
a quivering stop and they un-
ing thru the air above us,
buckled the straps that held
me.
My first flight wai over.
I shall never forget the in
spiration and thrilling joy of
it, and I have promiaed myself
It will not be my last.

SQUALL ON LAKE
DETAINS BOATS
Scores of young women who went
out canoeing Sunday evening on
I.ake Washington talked very fast
Monday trying to explain to their
parents why they were away from
home all night.
A squall which sprung up sud
denly early in the evening swept at
least 200 canoes across to points
along the opposite shore, from
which the occupants found it Impos
sible to return against the wind.
Twenty canoes were beached on
Sand point, across from the Vnl
verslty Canoe club, alone. The
canoeists built a campfire and
spent the night there. Other small
er parties camped with less com
fort and greater solitude.
Only one canoe was reported to
have capsized, a bout belonging at
the Vnlverslt; club. The >oung
men who were In It swam safely to
shore.
