DEADLY BLOWS AT
FEDERALISM
Former Justice Hughes Nomi
nated "To Save His Party,
Not His Country."
Washington, July 31. In a speech
today on the Thomas constitutional
amendment to mako federal judges in
eligible to any elective office, Sena
tor Walsh, Democrat, declared that
former Justice Hughes was nominat
ed for the presidency by the Repub
licans "to save his party, not to save
tho country" and charged that no
more deadly blow ever had been aim
ed at the federal judge system.
Senator Walsh said it was apparent
to defer action on the proposed
amendment until a calmer time and
that the election in November would
serve as a referendum on the prin
ciple involved. If Mr. Hughes were
defeated, he said, no political party
would likely have the hardihood again
to name as its candidate for president
a member of the supreme court; while
if ho were elected the Republican
party could not stultify Itself by sub
mitting or consenting to the amend
ment. The senator referred to Justice
Hughes' declination to be a candidate
for the year 1912 and his interview
at the time on the subject made pub
lic by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise.
rjudging by the past," he continued,
"there must be general acquiescence
In tho view of Justice Hughes that 'no
man is as necessary to his country's
well being as is the unstained integrity
of the courts.'
"A departure from the salutary rule
in consequence of which no justice
of the supreme court has ever, until
now, become the candidate for any
party for the office of president can
be justified only in some crisis Involv
ing the national life.
Walsh Questions Need.
"What condition called for a disre
gard of it in the present exigency?
What radical change is demanded in
order to preserve the country, or its
institutions, from impending collapse
or ruthless destruction? From what
quarter Is our independence threat
ened?" Senator Walsh said that it was only
just to assume that Justice Hughes'
nomination came to him unsought and
"that ho had no hand in the well or
dered pre-couventlon campaign that
was conducted in his behalf."
Senator Townsend Replies.
Senator Townsend of Michigan
spoke in reply.
"It is a compliment to Mr. Hughes
that no one has raised any other is
sue against him," he said. "He has
never pandered to classes or to public
sentiment but has adhered to his duty
as he saw it. The public career' of
Mr. Hughes stands alone In Ameri
can history."

Chicago and Middle West
Hope Grim Toll From Ex

Today.

Chicago, July 31 The end of one
of the worst periods of hot weather
Chicago ever experienced came today
on the wings of nn 18 milo wind from
the north. A drop of 22 degrees in
temperature from 102, the highest
reached yesterday, was recorded at
9 o'clock this morning when the gov
ernment thermometer registered SI.
The wind sprang up at 4 o'clock and
gradually increased in velocity, tho
weather bureau predicting it would
shift to the northeast" whence comes
the usual cooling "lake breeze." Lake
Michigan, yesterday nearly smooth as
glass, today was covered with white
caps.
The hot spell began on July 1, since
which time the temperature was con
stantly above normal. Yesterday's
record was twenty degrees higher than
the normal. There is no indication
of a return of the heat for days, accord
ing to the weather bureau.
Cicago, July 31. Chicago and the
middle west figuratively faced tho
weather stage and awaited the prom
ised boon' of cooler weather today,
meanwhile anxious that tonight would
witness the final curtain in the grim
toll of death and suffering that has
held its attention in the excessive heat
of nearly a week's duration. For the
directors of the weather bureau have
promise lower temperatures by tomor
row at least
It was said that the cool wave
would be felt in Chicago possibly by
tonight at 7 o'clock and that by day
light tomorrow morning it would be
pleasant to live. And better still, by
tomorrow night there would be nice
congenial summer weather, even for
tho poorer youngster of tho melting
pot districts of the larger cities.
Sunday's Heat Tragedy.
Chicago after yesterday's tragedy
of 115 deaths attributed to the heat
and more than 400 prostrations, for
the most part slept outdoors again
last night. The numerous parks of the
city were vast sleeping apartments,
and Lake Michigan, the friend of rich
and poor alike, furnish comfort to
thousands of bathers as1 late as mid
night. On many of the beaches tho
usual regulations wore forgotten. More
than 180,000 persons, it was estimated,
. spent yesterday and last night in the
lake and nenrly as many more were
turned' away because of lack of accom-
modations. , l
The record breaking death rate of
the last week has seriously tested
the facilities of the coroner's office.

North Carolina, Democratic leader in

recently lessened his opposition. Al

is not believed he will make a very
strenuous fight in the house against

been the most distressing phase of
the situation. Upwards of fifty babies
were reported to have succumbed to

Just like yesterday, only perhaps not
quite so warm. Last night ho said
that he would be surprised if the ther
mometer failed to go above 90 degrees. '
The promise of cooler weather was
made good so far as the Lake Superior
region was concerned last night, ac
cording to the forecaster. The cool
wave, which Is coming from the north
twest, is moving faster on its north
end than it Is on its south end. No
hope of rain immediately is held out
however. Simply lower temperatures.
Hot Wave Spreads South.
Washington, July 31. After break
ing several heat records In the west
ern upper lake region, the hot wave
today had spread into tho middle and
south Atlantic states. An Area of
high pressure coming from the Ca
nadian northwest and moving south
east, caused an appreciable fall In
temperature throughout the upper
Mississippi valley and the north and
west upper lake regions.
In tho south and west, however, ex
treme temperatures were recordd.
Coolr weather was predicted by the
weather bureau officials lor Tues
day In the lako region and eastern
New York but elsewhere in the east
and in the Ohio valley and tho south
the heat wave will maintain torrid
temperatures.
The governing temperature at 7
o'clock this morning in Chicago was
S2 degrees, three degrees lower than
on Sunday morning at tho same
time.
Brisk winds made it seem as if the
predicted cool weather 'had come
sooner than expected.
274 Persons Die.
Latest figures show that 274 per

Relief from tho torrid temperature
has begun over the territory west of

At that moment I heard the click
cf a shell being slipped into a gun, I
jumped around the corner of the hut.
A big Mexican with bandolieres
swung across his shoulders stepped
out quickly and raised his gun at
Wood. I tried to beat him to It, and
so did Wood. But ho got in a second
too soon and Wood fell. The Mexican
fell at my first shot and I finished
him with a second.

Soon I saw some Mexican troops
coming up.

I called 'Buenos diaz amigos' (Good

back signaling with their arms just

PICTURESQUE CAREER H
Sixth Time Strat ton Has Made
Spectacular Escape From
Some Prison.
Chicago, July 31, Clyde Stratton, 'H
noted convict and two other prisoners
escaped from the Illinois penitentiary
at Joliet yesterday, according to a
telegram received by the Chicago de
tectlve bureau last night. It was the
sixth time Stratton had broken out of
some prison in a comparatively short
criminal career. William Harte and
William McClade, the other two to
escape, were serving life sentences jH
for murder.
The fact that the men were gone jH
was not discovered until last night
when tho guards checked up thevpris
oners, who have been allowed the
freedom of the corridors of the cell
I house until 9 o'clock .during the hot
weather.
J Escape From Leavenworth.
Stratton Is "the convict who es- 'H
caped from the Leavenworth prison
by crawling a mile through a sewer.
Four times before that he had es
caped. This time he was serving a
fourteen-year sentence for tho mur- IH
der of a banker at Silvia, 111.
Stratton has had a picturesque ca
reer. He was arrested In richly fur
nlshed npartments here soon after the
Loguo murder in the McVicker build- jH
ing several years ago and turned
over to the federal authorities for a
postofflce robbery and sent to Leav
enworth. Guns and ammunition and
much loot were found in his apart
ments. Previous to his Leavenworth '
escape, Stratton twice got out of the
Ohio penitentiary.
That at this time the most prosperous period that Og- H
den has ever enjoyed there are people in this community in 1
want and distress. Not people who have received that position 1
through shiftlessness, carlessness or extravagance; but people" 1
of our best blood people of the heroic class who have let 1
fathers, sons and husbands their means of support go to
the front to protect their country
Now it's up to the people of Ogden to take care of these 1
