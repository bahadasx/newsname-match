The opening of the present week
finds the prospects of the entente al
lies perhaps brighter than in any pre
vious period of the war, according to
the views held here, and the position
of the Central Powers more discour
aging. Gen. Brussiloff's striking vic
tories present the German general
staff with the imperative problem of
how to reinforce .the . eastern front
since Gen. von Linsingen, who was
sent by the Germans to aid the shat
tered Aiistrians, now has been com
pletely thrust back from the Lutsk
salient. ' ' .
But the same problem is presented
on the western front, says an unoffi
cial correspondent, the ceaseless bat
tle seems steadily to gain intensity.
"Doubtless the constant arrival of
fresh German troops and guns," he
' adds, "has everything to do with this
result. The enemy shows an increas
ing tendency to counter-attack."
These counter-attacks have failed
to stem the steady "entente allied ad
vances, and althougn at present the
fighting on the Somme is -mainly de
voted to obtaining mastery of small
strategic, positions, which will be the
keys to further progress, there is yet
no sign of the Germans making any
effective counter-offensive.

HUGE SHIPMENT OF THREAD
In the A. C. L. freight depot is a
single shipment of thirty cases of
knitting thread or yarn which the 18
knitting machines at the Ocala Knit
ting Mill will soon convert into knit
ted underwear. These' cases. average
400 pounds each, making a total of
12,000 pounds, which is quite a lot of
thread.
Few people realize tne importance
to Ocala of the Ocala Knitting Mill.
It is now employing 75 people, has
18 knitting machines and over 50 in
dividual machines used in the differ
ent finishing features of the garments.
Twelve to fourteen hundred dozen
finished garments are being shipped
north each week. If the factory could
deliver ten times this quantity each
week it would be taken by its selling
agents, Messrs. Clif t & Goodrich of
New York City, just like a bucket of
water is soaked up in dry sand.
It is very gratifying to know that
the mill has not had a single com
plaint from the hundreds of different
houses throughout the United tSates
to whom the goods have been shipped
by Clift & Goodrich, and some of the
big houses which have places orders
for as much as five thousand dozen
garments would soon complain, if the
goods were not giving their custom
ers entire satisfaction.
When one thinks of the many enter
prizes that have failed m the state,
some of them, unfortunately, in
Ocala, it is mighty fine to know that
this enterprise, fostered and operated
entirely by colored people, is making
a 100 per cent success.

ain is warned, in the American note
of protest against the blacklist, made
public last night by the state depart
ment, of the "many, serious . conse
quences, to neutral right and neutral
relations which auch an act must nec
essarily involve."
Already in the hands- of the British
foreign office, the note declares "in
the gravest terms" that it is "mani
festly out of the question that the
government of the United States
should acquiesce in such methods"
and that the United States regards
the blacklist as "inevitably and essen
tially inconsistent with the rights of
all the citizens of all the nations not
involved in the war." It reminds the
British government that "citizens of
the United States are entirely within
their rights in attempting to trade
with the people of. the governments of
any of the nations now at war, sub
ject only to well defined international
practices and understandings which
the government of the United States
deems the government of Great Brit
ain to have too lightly and frequently
disregarded." - v - -
The American note is even more
positive in its terms than officials
have intimated. Ambassador Page
