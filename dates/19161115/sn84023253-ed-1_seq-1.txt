BABY SMUGGLED IN
Canadian Doctor Left Waif On C. W.
Skinner's Door Step.
Orleans, Nov. 14 Two clews have
at last been followed by Overseer T.
G. Crandall of Brownington, and the
identity established beyond a doubt
of the baby boy who was left on the
door step, wrapped in an old wornout
horse blanket, at the home of C. W.
Skinner in East Brownington, early
Sunday morning, Oct. J 9.
The little waif, having no home,
had been supported by Dr. Gilfillan
of Beebe, P. Q., outside of his home
and feeling that it was a burden he
could no longer carry, he brought it to
this side of the line and disposed of
it as stated above.
The writer has seen the child and
found it to be an unusually bright and
promising little fellow. He will
probably remain with Mr. and Mrs.
Converse, who have become greatly
attached to him.

DEER HUNTERS START
St. Johnsbury Sportsmen Take The
Rifle From the Wall and Hit the
Trail.
St. Johnsbury sportsmen have tak
en the rifle from the wall or from the
closet or wherever else it has reposed
for a year, in anticipation of the deer
season which opens tomorrow, Nov.
,15. From 5 a. m. to 5 p. m. until
December 5th inclusive, excepting
Sundays, deer having horns not less
than three inches In length, may be
taken.
Many have been happily employed
during spare hours the past few days
in oiling up the automatic, grinding
the old hunting knife to a skinning
edge and getting their kits in shape
for the few days in the woods which
have been anticipated for months
back.
Those who haven't the time for
the pleasures of camp life are making
plans for at least one or two days in
which to make a try for a little veni
son. Considering the fall or snow during
the night, the outlook for the hunter
is good, and although the present fall
may melt before the opening day,
those who are" located the day pre
vious will have a chance to look the
ground over and get an idea as to
how the deer are running. It is al
most a certainty that enough snow
will fall before December 5 to be of
material advantage to the hunters,
which was one more chance to bring
down a buck given them, when the
season was made later by a previous
legislature.
Victory will again stand a big fav
orite among the hunting parties who
are out after a few days' sport. Stan
nard mountain will also have the usual
number from this locality, as well at
many on the other side of the hill.
Others will make plans for a ten days'
or more stay and go further away into
the wilder region of Ferdinand to the
south of Brighton. But nevertheless
there still remains the. wary old hunt
er, who has his quiet spot picked out
year after year, and who will be found
ready and waiting, as soon as daylight
breaks on the first day. He it is who
during the summer has kept watch
of his favorite spot to see that the
locality is being tenanted by the deer
family, and usually the end of the
day finds him carrying home one more
trophy of the season's sport.

NEW FISH HATCHERY GOOD
Commissioner Titcomb Plans To Raise
500,000 Trout at Bennington.
State Fish and Game Commissioner
John W. Titcomb of Lyndon ville was
in Bennington Sunday afternoon, ar
riving on the flyer from Pennsylvania
where he had been on a business tri-
and where he visited some of tne
state and private commercial hatch
eries. Accompanied by County Game
Warden E. S. Higgins, the commis
sioner visited the new Bennington
county sub hatchery in the Bushnell
district and expressed himself as much
pleased with the natural conditions
and the work that has been accom
plished by the warden.
The hatchery is now ready for busi
ness. It is the intention of the com
missioner to hatch a half a million
trout eggs at the station during the
coming winter. Of the fry hatched in
the early spring as many as possible
will be raised to the fingerling stage
before being distributed in the
stream. The eggs will be received
some time in December.
Commissioner Titcomb stated that
the water supply at the new hatchery
is one of the best in the couirlry for
hatchery purposes. In his opinion the
facilities available, the water supply
from the springs, a small brook and
the South stream, would permit the
raising of a million fingerlings a year
if it were thought advisable to develop
the property to such proportion.
NEW ENGLAND
FRUIT SHOW
Annual Exhibition of Society Open
ed At Montpelier Tuesday
Evening
STATE GIVES WELCOME
Vermont Horticultural Society Observ
ing Its 21st Anniversary Vermont
Apples Now Recognized, Says G.
B. Aitkins An Address On
Marketing Fruit.
Montpelier, Nov. 14 The first New
England fruit show to be held in Ver
mont began this evening in City hall
in connection with the 20th annual
meeting of the Vermont State Horti
cultural society. The storm of last
night which continued until noon to
day interferred with the attendance.
Although there was a very satisfactor
crowd present.
The floor of the auditorium is given
up to the exhibition of apples and on
the banks and tables, which run the
length of the auditorium, are shown
at least 125 varieties of native fruit
with 80 exhibitors. This makes the
largest New England fruit show ever
held. Vermont is represented with 4 0
exhibitors and the remaining New
England states are represented with
approximately the same number of
exhibitors. The Connecticut Agricul
tural college at Storrs, Conn., exhibits
66 varieties of apples and the state of
Connecticut is making a fine display,
including 10 varieties, through the
Connecticut Pomological society. This
exhibit fills 35 cases and was trans
ported from Hartford, Conn., to Mont
pelier by auto truck.
At 8 o'clock Gov. Charles W. Gates
welcomed both organizations and vis
itors to the state of Vermont. James
B. Estee, president of the Montpelier
Board of Tnfde, extended a welcome
on the part of the city of Montpelier.
E. H. West of Dorset, president of
the Vermont Horticultural society, re
sponded on behalf of his organization.
He said in part:
Growth of the Society.
"The Vermont society is celebrating
its 21st birthday in a manner most
pleasing to its members. From a mod
est beginning, we have grown until our
membership is now about 500.- What
we hope and expect to do is to put
Vermont on the horticultural map. We
have every natural advantage with our
geographical location, cheap lands,
low freight rates to the greatest mark
ets of the world, but up to date, there
are only a few growers in the state
that are practicing scientific apple
culture. These few, however, have
demonstrated the wonderful fruii
growing possibilities of much of our
land."
Responding on behalf of the New
England fruit show, George D. Aiken,
vice-president of that organization,
said in part:
"A few years ago, Mr. George W.
Perry, then president of the Vermont
Horticultural society, right here in
this hall, gave us a motto. That mot
to is, 'Boom the apple, and the apple
will boom Vermont.'
-We began boominng the apple, but
for three years, no answering boom
was heard. Last year at the New
England fruit show, in Boston, the
Vermont apple gave a boom that was
heard ,all over New England. The
Vermont exhibit that went down there
came home with 53 ribbons, or more
than all the other states combined,
except Massachusetts, which natural
ly got more, being right on the spot.
Tonight the Vermont apple and other
New England apples are giving r
boom which will be heard across the
continent.
"Now here at this meeting, let us
start to boom the New England apple
and in two or three years, that boom
will be heard across the Rocky moun
tains, and the people there will hear
it and understand that it means that
they can no longer send their inferior
quality apples into the markets under
our very noses and get the price per
box that we get per barrel."
Fault Growers Mast Cooperate
i
The princiuai speaker of the eve
ning was Hon. Wilfred Wheeler of
Boston, secretary of the Massachusetts
State Board of Agriculture. His sub
ject was "Marketing Horticultural
Products." and he spoke in brief as
follows:
"The problems of agriculture today
is one of production of large quantities
of special crops In large areas and
marketing through organization. The
East has seen the West capture its
markets. It has done this through
large production and through efficient
organizaton. As a result the West has
forced the East to organize and we
must organize with a uniform product,
a uniform package and uniform meth
ods of selling.
"Massachusetts produces $50,000,
000 worth of agricultural products
annually and consumes $250,000,000
worth of these products. It is not a
question with us of disposal of prod
ucts, but a question of how to dispose
of them and I may say that most or
ganizations for disposal of crops be
gin at the wrong end."
Mr. Wheeler then went into the de
tail of growing crops, the purchase of
supplies, farm management, credit fa-j
cilities, question of manager, question
of marketing, the disposal of surplus, j
machinery on the farm, and the pack-

ages produce should take. He then
said:
"The same good management on one
farm is likely to succeed on another
farm in the same section. The labor
of one farm should be utilized on an
other farm during the busy season.
Under such arrangement, cost would
be reduced and especially is this meth
od advisable in the packing season as
a trained crew is far more effective
than green help. Cooperation in the
use of machinery can be mad" to work
out satisfactorily and at a reduction
of cost below that of individual own
ership. By marketing farm products
through an organization capital is
more easily secured.
"One feature that might well be
utilized in marketing products of the
farm is that of advertising and this
is sure to come as organizations are
effected."
The proceedings of the Horticultur
al society, as well as the fruit show,
will continue through the week. Wed
nesday there will be three sessions ot
the Horticultural society.

Gen. Wood spoke in part as fol
lows:
Gen. C. W. Wood's Address.
I am going to speak to you today
upon the subject of "Degrees," but
there are various degrees in' all things
and I am going to talk on a degree 'n
which many of you perhaps have al
ready been instructed, and which I
think the most important of all,
"The Superlative Degree."
First we all of us live, as far as
want is concerned in a superlative
degree. There is no country in thto
world that brings the blessing, th
prosperity as the United States o.
Amen"'1. :'. . -'te the fact that we are
7 or, si . , -orlng to make po
d the steady in-,'-e
'puiation for whom
s.pected of us and
. for them,
regard ourselves aA
t and most upright
jbe. I am today ad
ho are plying a voca
re trying to ply It In a
ree. No vocation tends
e physical and mental
,o. 'man as he who is
brought Into direct contact with na
ture. Talking to those who are working
in this club In the superlative degree,
he spoke of the cow as the greatest
of all domestic animals, and one
which most generously responds to all
that is done for it and further said,
man has appropriated the uses of her
body to various uses and there is no
creature that is utilized to the proflt
aibleness of man as is the cow. There
is no man who can be associated
with this work and be a good breeder
for many years without being a better
man.
He'then went on to show the sup
eriority of the Holstein over other
breeds, and gave statistics from lead
ing experiment stations throughout
the country showing the great milk
producing qualities of the Holstein,
and further showed the high stand
ard of butter fat added to large
amount of milk a cow produces.
He warned the breeder against "be
ing carried away," with official re
ports, but further said for them not
to he discouraged with results of an
experiment if it did not measure up
as only by much practice could rec
ords be made. He then went on to
advise the building up of the dairy
to a certain high standard which it
was possible to maintain without
seeking for records, but which would
give the greatest Income. He showed
how many good cows had been spoil
ed in the past by pushing beyond It
Individual abilities for'a time,
r He also said the annual record of
ithe Holstein has in his Idea done more
to place the breed on the high pedes
tal which it now holds than any of
the shorter records. The breed has
a grat future ahead if It can be dem
onstrated that large production can
