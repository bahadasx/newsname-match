Good Skating Promised, Along with
Fine Weather
Zero weather hit us Sunday night
with increasing severity since, till
Monday and Tuesday nights, when
the icc came down so thick as to
completely fill the channel, culmin
ating this (Wed.) morning, when
the mail, with three hands, was
unable to effect a landing on the
west side, after fighting their way
thru th6 ice
The last trip of the White Swan
was made Sunday. Monday morn
ing the boat was ice-boundt with
ice lodged in front of the barge
landing on the west side of the
river.
Monday the barge and platform
on this side was pulled out of the
water, and Tuesday the same
thing was done on the west side
Active work of pulling the boat
out on to dry land is now proceed
ing. It is stated that if open wea
ther continues the hull of the boat
will be given a new coat of paint.
It is only occasionally that the
river in freezing gives us a smooth
surface. It looks now as if we
are to have the finest skating that
we have euer enjoyed. The cur
rent of the river in rounding the
point above the Agency left a big
sheet of shallow water on this side
of the river, from the ferry landing
up, which has frozen over without
any running ice being in it. In
this place the ice is now|as much as
two inches thick, and is compara
tively safe for skaters, provided
the freezing at night continues.
The eldest son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Ashley aged about ten

ents as will all the school play
mates, as Johnny Ashley was a
general fayorite with his friends.
Interment was made in the Mo
bridge cemetery, Wednesday after
noon.
Rev. Ashley of Aberdeen, came
up Tuesday to be present at the
funeral services of his grandson,

Mr. Giles Tapetola one of the
leading Indians of the Reservation
writes The Press as follows in re
sponse to our request for news
under date of November 11th:
"I suppose you are waiting for
me to send the program of the
Harvest Home at Thunder Butte,
as I said. But I am very sorry to
say that the papers are all tanked
up and cannot be put together so
I cannot procure a good program
from head to tail. There
was a very good exhibit of stock
and other products of all kinds.
You know the Cherry Creek and
Thunder Butte Indians cannot very
well take their live stock to the
Fair at the Agency, while they
have a chance to show what they
have at the '"Harvest Home'1 at
their substation.
"The location of Thunder Butte
subagencv is one of the most beau
tiful places, with the best build
ings on the reservation. Most of
the Thunder Butte Indians are
raising good alfaita.
Most of Ithe full blood Indians
live in Thunder Butte district.
Iron Lightning, Straight Head,

(brother of Chief White Swan)
Charles Corn, Combing and Two
Eagle are the natural type of old
timers living in Thunder Butte
district.
Our white brothers are well
supplied with small grain around
Dupree and still threshing. Every
day and most on Saturdays about
ten or more teams loaded with
grain are brought in to the elevat
ors at Dupree, also herds of cattle
and sheep. The homesteaders also
are raising small grains. Many
newcomers are taking land every
day. But the trains are slow to
bring them in, sometimes a day
behind, Nearly all the Indians
are leasing their unoccupied allot
ments to stock men for sheep and
cattle.
