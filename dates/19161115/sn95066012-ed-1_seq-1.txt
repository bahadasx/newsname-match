Chairman Lee Says Suits Will Be

MEN DEPEND ON PRESIDENT
Brotherhood Head Declares Wilson
WjM Remedy Whatever Defect May
Be Found in the Law.
New York, Nov. 15. The interrupt
ed conference between representa
tives of the nations railways and their
400,000 brotherhood employes, look
ing toward an adjustment of their new
differences on the Interpretation of
the Adamson eight-hour law, was not
resumed here yesterday. Instead of
meeting, the railway managers an
nounced they would fight the law to
the end in the courts while the broth
erhood chiefs who remained in the
city left for their homes, professing
to believe that they may safely rest
their case with President Wilson.
The attitude of the railways was
summarized in a statement issued by
Chairman. Ellsha Lee after an all-day
meeting of the railroad representa
tives. The statement read: "We are
agreed to light to the end. The means
to be employed were fully discussed
and the consensus of opinion was that
it was necessary to file suits question
ing the constitutionality of the law
in every federal district court in
which the affected railroads operate."
Warren S. Stone, president of the
brotherhood of locomotive engineers,
epitomized the brotherhoods' side be
fore leaving for Cleveland. Mr. Stone
said: "The situation is closed in so
far as we are concerned. We are
not at all alarmed. We know what
President Wilson intended we should
have. "We know the explanation he
made to our 600 chairmen in the
White House. We feel confident that
If the present law doesn't give us the
eight hour day, the president will give
us a law that will."
TUBERCULOSIS SUNDAY
Thousands of Churches to Observe
the Day Dec. 3 or 10.
More than 100,000 churches and oth
er religious organizations ar expect
ed to observe Tuberculosis Sunday on
Dec. 3 or 10, this year making the
seventh annual participation of relig
ious bodies In an Intensive campaign
to educate the public on the subject
of tuberculosis.
Two SundayB have been, designated
by the National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis
In order that the churches may
choose the one which will best fit in
with their program of services. These
dates come at the beginning and end
of tuberculosis week, which is con
ducted under the direction of the Na
tional association. For those wor
shiping on Saturday, Dec. 2 or 9 have
been set aside.
The fact that tuberculosis Sunday is
an undenominational and non-sectarian
movement Is being emphasized in
order that all possible religious
groups may be reached, in addition,
many Boclal, fraternal and civic or
ganizations are planning to hold meet
ings on one of these days or at other
times during tuberculosis week. Fif
teen hundred state and local anti-tuberculosis
associations in every state
in the Union are assisting in arousing
enthusiasm and organizing the cam
paign so that on these days the sub
ject of tuberculosis will be presented
to the greatest possible number of
people.
It is estimated that last year 2,000,
000 pieces of literature were distrib
uted during tuberculosis week, a half
million of which were sent out by the
national association. This year the
association has prepared a sermon on
Indifference to Tuberculosis and a
pamphlet entitled Talking Points on
Tuberculosis. A prayer written es
pecially for tuberculosis Sunday by
Prof. Walter Rauschenbush of the
Rochester Theological seminary will
also bo distributed. Copies of these
pamphlets and others relating to the
week's campaign may be obtained by
writing to The National Association
for the Study and Prevention of Tu
berculosis, 105 East 22d street, New
York city.

Buds Middlemen Responsible for
Present High Food Prices
WELCOMES NATIONAL GRANGE
Chief Executive Did Not Refer to
Proposed Embargo Nor Mention
Presidential Election.
Washington, Nov. 14. President
Wilson held the middleman re
sponsible for the high cost of food
stuffs tonight in a speech welcoming
to Washington the convention of the
National Orange, the first formal
speech he lias delivered since the dec
tion. Urging that tanners increase
their output, the President said:
"We ought to raise such big crops
that circumstances like the present
can never recur, when men can make
as if the supply was so short that the
middleman could (harge for it what
he pleased, it will not do to be nig
gardly with the rest of the world in
respect to its food supply."
The President did not mention re
cent petitions to him to declare an
embargo - the exportation of food
stuffs from the United States, and he
did not refer even indirectly to the
outcome of the Presidential election.
His address was interrupted fre
quently by applause from the fanners
attending the fiftieth anniversary
celebration of the founding of the
Orange.
RUMORED CABINET CHANGES
Five
of President's Advisors May
Leave Public Life.
Washington, Nov. 13. President
Wilson, back in the White House Tor
the first time since the campaign be
gan two months ago. plunged into
work today in an effort to clear his
desk of accumulated business. Tak
ing for granted that he had been ri
elected, he asked no questions about
electoral votes, but did display anxie
ty over the political complexion of the
next house of representatives.
The President is said to desire no
general changes in the personnel of
his administration. It was stated
definitely today that no cabinet offic
ers will be asked to resign either now
or next March although it is possible
that one or more may wish to retire
for personal or business reasons.
Among those who have been reported
as considering resigning have been
Attorney Oeneral Oregory. Secretary
Redfleld, Secretary Baker. Secretary
Daniels and Secretary McAdoo.
Vance C. McCormick, chairman of
the Democratic national committee
and Senator Walsh of Montana who
had charge of western headquarters
in Chicago during the campaign, are
understood to have impressed the
President particularly, and it was
said today to be more than likely that
in case there should be vacancies in
the cabinet or In other" important
posts, both of them will be asked to
I join the administration. Harry A.
Garfield, piesident of Williams col
lege, a son of former President James
A. Garfield, also is said to be looked
on as being of cabinet calibre.
Henry Morgenthau, who is treasur-
. er of the Democratic national com
mittee, came here in company with
Kdward L. Doheny and had luncheon
with the President. Here is what he
is quoted as saying:
"I have heard on good authority
that some of the present members of
the cabinet wish to leave."
"Is it likely", he was asked, "that
these vacancies so made will be
filled by men from the west?"
"I think," he replied, "the inference
is logical. Hut bear this in mind. No
promise or pledge of any kind has
been made. The men who fought for
President Wilson's reelection did so
as a privilege and not with the hope
of gain. It was a high minded public
service entered into without thought
of recompense."
Nobody has performed this service
more faithfully than Mr. Morgenthau
himself, and this fits in with a report
j circulated today and which found
credit in well posted circles that Mr.
j Morgenthau is to become secretary
of the treasury.
AERO CLUB OF VERMONT
First Annual Meeting Will Be Held in
Burlington Nov. 27.
The first annual meeting of the
Aero club of Vermont will be held on
Monday evening, November 27, at the
Hotel Vermont, Iturllngton. The an
nual dinner of the club will be held at
7 o'clock, to be followed by addresses
and tho annual business meeting.
All citizens of Vermont interested
in aeronautics are urged to be pres
ent. Tickets for the dinner may be
secured by application to James P,
Taylor, secretary, Stannard Memorial
building, Burlington.
Soaring Cost of Production Makes
Advance Imperative.
Increased activity in other indus
tries has made labor in the tobacco
growing districts scarce, and the price
cf labor unprecedentedly high. The
wooden cases in which domestic to
bacco is packed, the cheese-cloth un
der which shadegrown tobacco is
grown, fertilizers necessary to soil,
implements used In cultivation, etc.,
ail have advanced. And in Cuba the
great boom in sugar has diverted ag
riculturalists to that industry and
created a shortage of good Havaua
leaf.
The result is that all kinds of leaf
tobacco used for cigar purposes in
this country have gone skyward.
Cigar manufacturers, therefore, are
paying more for leaf tobucco than ever
before in the history of the industry,
and, in addition to this, the price of
cigar boxes, labels, workmanship and
all other details of operating have in
creased tremendously.
The upshot of it Is that, while even
before the war began a large propor
tion of manufacturers were, at the
best, just about breaking even on
their investment, now they find them
selves actually and almost without ex
ception playing a losing game.
The ultimate consequence Is that
without any concerted or organized
movement, cigar manufacturers every
where- are either advancing prices on
their cigars outright or are reducing
the size of the various brands and
shapes that they make.
Of course, there was another alter
native, namely: to change the com
position of the cigar ami by using
cheaper and inferior tobacco to re
duce the cost of production. The
better class of manofacturers. how
ever, has refused absolutely to con
sider such a recourse. Having
spent years in establishing their
brands and maintaining them at a
uniform quality, even in the face or
many difficulties, they propose to up
hold and continue the quality of their
product.
For the first time In the history of
this country, with the possible excep
tion of the Civil War period retail
prices of cigars are going up.
That cigar pmokers have enjoyed a
half century of respite from price
fluctuation is not because the cost of
production- has remained stationary
during all these years. Operating ex
penses and the prices of raw mater
ials have gone up and down, mostly
up In the cigar business, the tame
as in any other business. But there
are two things which have tended to
keep the retail prices of cigars uni
form; first, because of the fixed habit
of paying a nickel, six for-a-quarter.
threefor-aquartc r. ten cents straight,
and so on up, for cigars, without any
Intermediate prices: and, second, be
cause tobacco Is generally classified as
a luxury and not a necessity.
These two circumstances have
made both manufacturers and cigar
store keepers 1 nth to disturb the
equanimity of the smoker during all
these yearn, even though there have
lieen many ocaslons when the cigar
manufacturing trade generally has
found its yearly balance to be on the
wrong side of the ledger.
As far back as ten years ago the
profit In cigar manufacturing had
been reduced to such an extent that
only the most sagacious operators
found' the business profitable. These
conditions continued progressively
and when the European war began,
two and one-half years ago, the, situ
ation became even more acute.
It Is true that the great war has not
materially increased tho exportation
of either Cuban or American leaf to
bacco to Europe, but It has advanced
the cost of virtually every element en
tering into cigar manufacturing.
It Is recognized by manufacturers
that the retailer cannot be expected
to stand the Increase. Owing to
severe competition and high rentals
the thousands of retailers throughout
tho country tot a long time have been
finding it very difficult to make ends
meet. Operating, as they are, on a
procarlously narrow margin of profit,
they could scarcely survive If the ad
vance In cost were to be taken out of
their small earnings.
The Increase, therefore, whether in
the form of an outright raise In price
or by making smaller cigars, must be
paid for by the smoker.
It Is believed that the consumer will
accept the upward tendency as grac
iously as he has accepted Increases
on almost every ether article of gen
eral consumption.
Whether or no, he will have to be
gin paying more for his ravorlte brand
of cywrs now, or If not now, In tho
near future. -Tobacco Leaf.

COURSE DISPROVED BY NEUTRALS
German Chancellor Informed Deporta
tion Is Creating Unfavorable
Impression In U. S. ,
Washington, Nov. 14. The good
offices of the United States Govern
ment are being exerted in an effort
to bring a halt to the deportation of
Belgian civilians Into Germany for
forced laboi .
Instructions dealing with the sub
ject have been sent by Secretary Lans
Ing to Joseph C. Grew, Secretary of
the American Kmhassy at Merlin,
who is Charge d'Affaires Id the ab
sence of Ambassador Gerard, who Is
in this country on leave.
These instructions direct Mr. Grew
to take the matter up personally with
Dr. von Dethnmnn Hollweg, the Im
perial Chancellor, in an effort to per
suade the German authorities that
these deportations should be stopped,
by pointing out that the removal of
Belgians into Germany for forced la
bor is having a most unfavorable im
pression on neutral public opinion.
and especially on neutral opinion in
the United States, where there Is,
and has been since the beginning of
the war great solicitude for the wel
fare of the Helgian population.
ESSAY ON PANTS
Some Interesting Thoughts About
Those Worn by Man.
Pants are of two kinds; human and
dog.
The human pants of commerce are
worn mainly by malos.
But equal rights prevail among
dogs.
Human pants are worn thicker in
winter and thinner in summer.
A dog's pants come thicker in the
summer.
The dog's lungs are the seat of its
pants. (Date 1S75. llostetter's Alman
ac). White pants are not a garment.
They are a business to themselves.
The man who wears them doesn't
work at much else at the time.
When i was small and on a farm, 1
wore pants that were not new.
So far as 1 could find out, they
never had been new.
When they had been first worn out.
by the first tailless ancestor I had,
they had been patched at all the ven
tilated places.
When the original goods wore out
between the patches, the first patches
wcio connected by other patches.
And sew on.
Where they overlapped the
patches the goods became about an
Inch thick.
And when human legs made of any
material less durable than vulcanized
flint are Incased in a set of lneh-and-
a-quarter Deer Island Jeans trousers
patched 'with every kind of heavy
goods from horse blankets to rem
nants or rag carpet when, I say, any
human neither limbs pre incarcerated
in these bedless tubular garments in
a wheat field on a southwest hillside
at 1! o'clock on a clear, still day when
the temperature, is 110 in the shade
and there Is no shade, the owner of
said legs thinks longingly of tho bas
tlle, tlto stocks, the pincers, the guil
lotine, the pillcry. the - thumb-screw
the rack, the stake and oilier religious
pleasantries.
I have gone long days in the wheat
field in a pair of such asbestos pants
lined with sandpaper or barbed wire,
and now death or publlo speaking or
fashionable dinners none of . those
things has any terror for me.
I playfully Inquire of death as to
the location of its stinger. Farm

Sleep was a rather scarce article
election night, so far as most of the
residents in the village were concern
ed. Upon the conclusion of the elec
tion returns that were received in
School hall Indicating a Republican
landslide a number of local Hughes
admirers thought it fitting and proper
to remind several prominent Demo
crats that their candidate had fill
outsido of the breastworks. Primi
tive musical instruments In the hands
of amateur musiclnas brought the
"sad tidings" to each Democratic
household about 3 a. m. Enthusiasm
ran so high caused one Republican to
cal for three cheers for Wilson which
was promptly suppressed by wiser
head-s amid threats of a ducking in
Prentiss pond should such breaks
occur again. The serenaders have
vanished to parts unknown and as one
Democrat remarked, "They are scarce
is Gorman Dyestuffs."
It Is well for a ninn to respect bis
own vocntlon, whatever it Is. and to
think himself bound to uphold It and
to claim for it the respect It deserves.

No Advance From Figures Estab
lished October 1
DEALERS CONSERVING SUPPLY
Sales for Household Use in Half Ton
Lots Present Prices $8 and $8.25
a Ton.
Bennington residents are exception
ally fortunate as regards the coal situ
ation. While dealers in all sections
of the country have been advancing
the prices to the consumers, here in
Bennington there has been no change
in figures since October and these
rates were forecasted months ago.
Cash prices for coal In Bennington to
day are $8 a ton for egg and $8.25 for
stove and chestnut. In Plttsfield yes
terday the price went to $12. In
North Adams coal Is reported to be
selling above $9 and this figure Is al
so said to be quoted in Rutland.
Neither of the two dealers, who
transact practically all of the business
in Bennington, have a sufficient sup
ply to carry them through the winter
but for the present at least there la
no danger of a shortage and little
prospect that there will be an im
mediate advance In prices. The deal
ers have not been compelled to pur
chase any "premium" coal of the
speculators who are boosting the
prices and they are hoping that with
what stocks they have on hand and
the premised changes In the situation
alter navigation closes on the great
lakes that they will be able to carry
their customers through the winter.
There Is a shortage of coal at the
mines due to the difficulty in securing
skilled labor. Many of the experienced,
miners have, left the coal regions to
work in the munition plants and the
operators are experiencing difficulty
In keeping the mines up to their ca
pacity. Then again, the big contracts
for the middle west are being filled,
while the steamers are running on the
great lakes. Navigation will close in
December and some relief Is then ex
pected. The Bennington dealers are conser
ving the supply to the best of their
ability. They are selling chestnut
coal, largely used In kitchen ranges,
in half tons and are limiting all orders
whenever it Is possible to do so.
Two factors have worked to the ad
vantage of Bennington people. The
weather has been unusually mild and
many iamilies have burned wood dur
ing the fall. In fact they have used so
much that it - difficult at the present
time to obtain a stick of stove wood
In the village. Then, too, all of the
local Industries have been running
full time for over a year and many fam
ilies who often have been unable to do
so this year put In supplies of coal
while the low summer prices prevail
