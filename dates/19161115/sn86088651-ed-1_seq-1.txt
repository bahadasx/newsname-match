Coach Hudson Announce That Hous
ton High and Allen Academy
Game Is Important One.
Probably the football game sched
uled In this city Monday afternoon be
tween the Allen Academy team and
the Houston High School team will be
the best prep game In this part of the
state this season. The Allen Acad
emy team has lost only one game this
season, this being to the Rice scrubs,
and this Is also the only team which
has whipped the Houston highs, and
the game Monday will settle the cham
pionship between the two. It Is
thought the Houston boys have a little
edge over the home team provided the
dope works out right The Rice boys
whipped the Allen boys pretty bad,
while they made one touchdown on
the Houston highs. The academy
team, however, according to Coach
Hudson, Is In much better condition j
than when they played Rice and they t
export to go Into the game for a hard
fight to a finish.

To Our Subscribers
We have been trying sincerely to establish a cir
culation department that can be depended upon to
give service. In revising our subscription lists recent
ly no one was cut off for non-payment of subscrip
tion, except when that person had been personally
seen and instructed our representative to discontinue
the paper.
Each carrier has a typewritten list that he is in
structed to carry with him every day showing tha
name of every person to whom a paper is to be de
livered. Our subscribers wilt appreciate that it is practi
cally an impossibility to tell a carrier where any on
lives, owing' to the fact that the houses are not num
bered. We are using every possible means and effort to
properly serve you, and will ask your cooperation in
view of the existing circumstances, to the extent that
when you see a carier go by without leaving you a
paper, to stop him and ask to see his list that you may
then personally learn where the weakness is. It is
possible that in some isolated cases in making our
revisions, a name has been unintentionally dropped
und we want to know of these cases. KINDLY AS

Uncle 8am Has Thrust Upon Him the
Big Job of Rescuing Boys Who
Enlist in European War.
(By Associated PrMl
Washington, D. C, Nov. 15 Of the
many unexpected duties the United
States has found thrust upon It by the
world war one of the strangest is that
of rescuing adventurous boys who en
list In the European armies.
- There have been more than a thou
sands such cases since the war began,
and even now letters praying for the
release of young soldiers of fortune
pour in the state department at the
rate of fifty a day. It has been neces
sary to assign an official to give spe
cial attention to the subject.
The story Is almost always the
same. The youngster, generally be
tween 16 and 20, suddenly disappears
and Is next heard from when he writes
home from Canada or England that
he has had enough of war and wants
to come home.
Then follows an almost tornado-like
correspondence In which officials, pa-
Jrents. congressmen and persons who
think they can hurry the processes of
else, or perhaps the American em-!
bassy, makes representations to the
foreign government and the adven
turer Is released and sent home.
Until recently the British govern
ment has been promptly releasing all
Americans under 21 on the request of
the United States government on the
ground that It Is illegal for such a
person to enlist In a foreign army
without parents' consent. Recently
the British government has shown a
disposition to reduce the age limit to
IS, when minors become of age In a
military sense.
PYAYER MEETING.
Remember there will be prayer
meeting at the Christian church to
night. The subject Is "My Money and
the Kingdom." You will find an out
line of the lesson In the Front Rank
paper. We will have good warm fires,
so don't stay at home.
