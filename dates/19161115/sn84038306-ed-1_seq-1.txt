HERALD {Independent
Dem.)—Everybody is talking alont
the significance of the election.
Here Is its principal significance
in a nutshell:
The election showed the Demo
crats what kind of a party they
must be and the Republican* what
kind of a party they must not'.?*
In order to win.
It wasn't the well-known Demo
cratic party that won the victory
It Was that pins something of the
outlook and the appeal that Vsoi
row Wilsote has gttew-it
It wasn't the old Eepabltcan pas
ty that lost the battle. Bat there
was enough of the «U reactionary
leadership and influence i* evidence
to set the West ajpiast it^x
nTIw Democratic party pins the
Wilms view and the Republican
party purged of certain reactionary
eyesores—that Is the logical mes
sage of the election to both parties.

"There are various causes for the

MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOL
CHILDREN.
Last Monday morning every child
of school age was examined by the
physicians of Manchester as to the.
presence of evidence of contagious
or communicable diseases.
Each child was given a certificate
of health which permitted the child
to re-enter school.
It was found that over one half
of the applicants were found defec
tive, having enlarged tonsils, ade
noids, nasal obstructions, decayed, ir
regular, malformed, or impacted
teeth together with -catarrhal affec
tions.
This is the first medical examina
tion demanded by the Manchester
School board and from the findings
it is hoped that similar examinations
will be more frequent in the future,
irrespective of the presence of au/
communicable disease.
An examination of this character
should be required at the beginning
of each school year and the names,
with a fnll history opposite each one
placed in the hands of the super
intendent or principal of schools.
Should any of the children be
backward in their studies or for any
reason be below the required stand
ard this record could easily be re
ferred to and in many cases the cause
Medical inspection of the schools
was first introduced in Boslcn about
twenty-five years ago for the control
of ^pidemics. This procedure has be
come more and more popular and
medical inspection haB developed to
Include the vastly important control
of all nutters affecting the health
of the child.
The time is not far distant when
the public health nurse will, be ju&t
as important a factor in a well regu
lated school aB any teacher in it. The
visiting^nurse has already become a
pprmai^ent. institution in many Iowa
'cities.
It has. been demonstrated, that
where public Jiealth naftes-^haxe been,
exeUi/»iv*ly W*^- fo« the^pwpose ©i
early detection, of the symptoms- of
suspected communicable .disease*
the percentage bf( cases, when the.
presence of a communicable disease
is afterwards confirmed, averages
the same as when physicians were
exclusively employed for that pur
pose.
Manchester can well afford to adont
such a movement. For a public health
nurse can secure a hearing that no
one else could for she could much
easier secure the confidence of te
home and could assure the people
that the object of the Healthy Depart
ment is not to create trouble -but t,pf
prevent it She could explain to tLe
mothers that to prevent disease is
more economical than to cure, the af
fection and owing to the fact that
such a nfirse would be non-partisan,
a better reporting of cases could be
secured and a much qporo efficient
quarantine established. It would
be the duty of this nurse to investi
gate the causes of all absentees, par
ticularly when the reason is given as
sicknesB. By this course an early
diagnosis and immediate treatment
would be secured and not only epl
demotes avoided but precious lives
saved,' ..
The'plan to follow the suspected
cases to the- home by the health
nurse would relieve the. family from
the responsibility of neglecting er
refusing to call the family physician
for tear of being quarantined. A
careful investigation of the
conditions and advice to the mother
in regard to the danger of transmis
sion from one member of the family
to another of all communicable dis
eases could be explained.
The people of Manchester weald
•welcome such a course and the school
board would make no mistake to
barken to the voice of the people.
