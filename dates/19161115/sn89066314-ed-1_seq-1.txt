Alumni Association Wants Annual
Football Game in St Louis.
St Louis alumni of Missouri and of
Illinois Universities are trying to ar
range an annual football game be
tween Illinois and Missouri to be
played at St Louis. The Alumni as
sociations in St Louis of both schools
have expressed themselves as strong
for the game but the drawback at
present to such an arrangement is a
Missouri Valley Conference rule which
prohibits conference teams to play on
any grounds but the college grounds
of one of the teams.
This rule, which went into effect in
1910, has only been violated once. This
fall Nebraska and the Oregon Aggies
played at Portland. Permission to do
this was obtained by a mail vote, the
athletic authorities of the schools vot
ing to allow the game to be played at
Portland because the game would
draw a larger crowd there, which
would help pay the expenses of the
long trip. Missouri and Illinois might
obtain permission to play one game at
St Louis but it is doubtful if annual
games to be p'.ayed there could be ar
ranged. "An annual game at St Louis be
tween Illinois and Missouri would be
a great thing for the sclfool'TaldT)!"-
rector C. L. Brewer today. "It would
bring St. Louis and the University in
closer touch, which is what wo need.
We would be glad to play Illinois an
annual game here and at Urbana, but
at present the conference rules pro
hibit the arranging of a game at St.
Louis. The governing athletic boards
of the conference Universities would
have to be consulted first"
Coach Schulte said he was also in
favor of a game each year with Illi
nois it it could be arranged without vi
olating the conference rules.
LECTURER PRAISES NORTHWEST

PRESIDENT HAY HELP
OBTAIN WORLD PEACE
Count Appomy, Hungarian
Pacifist, Sees New Hope in
Wilson's Re-election.
SAYS IDEA CHANGES
Small Parties in Belligerent
Nations Seek War's End,
He Explains.
By CARL W. ACKERMANN
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
BERLIN, Nov. 15. With campaign
worries off his mind and his election
assured, President Wilson "may prove
an altogether different" President, and
see his opportunity when the moment
arrhes to help obtain peace in Euro-
pe."
So declared Count Appomy, one of
the most prominent Hungarian leaders
and a world figure before the war in
the "peace by arbitration" movement,
on his arrival here today from Buda
pest to speak before the Reichstag.
"Peace is getting nearer," he de
clared. "I am sure it is on its way."
And he added with a happy smile: "I
don't expect peace will come within a
week, a month or two months. I' am
only certain that the foundations for
peace are now being laid.
Tone of Speeches Changed.
"If you will compare the speeches
Bethmann von HoIIweg and Earl Grey
made at the beginning of the war with
what they have said recently you will
see that the two important belliger
ents are on closer ground. Of course
they are still widely apart, but they
are approaching. And why not? All
we ask is security. We ask nothing
but to be permitted to live. We want
that peace which all people want to
live and exist happily as a nation."
"Is this common ground the desire
of all nations to obtain an Interna
tional agreement which will keep
peace V I asked.
."Yes." lie answered." "The "peace"
which closes this war must be a
peace which guarahtees future world
peace, if such peace can be, and I do
not know why it cannot Then all this
horrible bloodshed certainly will not
be in vain for future generations."
"But does England want this
peace?"
"Peace. Parties In AH Nations."
"There are peace parties in all
countries. Of .course, there Is a strong
war party In England and France. As
long as this party hopes to parcel out
Austria-Hungary and Turkey to the
Allies there will be no peace, but
when the Allies realize that we can
not be divided there will be peace. We
are not waging a war of conquest, but
the Allies are." He paused and de
manded, "But tell me, who was elected
President of the United States?"
The interviewer said that the" latest
reports indicated Wilson. '
"I hope It is Wilson," the Count re
sponded. "We know "Wilson. I might
say we' could be no worse off with
America, but we know nothing about
Hughes."
"Do you think Wilson could do
something now to help'bring the bel
ligerents together?" I asked.
"I think that if Wilson be elected
and he no longer has campaign wor
ries, he may prove an altogether dif
ferent President I think he will see
the opportunity when the moment ar
rives." Bryan Would Make Democracy Dry.
By United Press
NEW YORK, Nov. 15. William Jen
nings Bryan will devote the next four
years of his life to making Democracy
dry. In an interview today the one
time Secretary of State declared that
his party could not afford to take the
"immoral side of a moral issue"; that
prohibition is a big issue now, and
that members tf the Democracy will
not allow the party to be "buried In a
drunkard's grave." "
Bryan's drive against rum will be
gin immediately. He will leave to
night for Indianapolis to speak Sun
day. He will speak In Chicago Mon
day. He said today that conserva
tism will support the Wilson economic
and legislative program by 1920 and
will work toward new and important
issues, such as prohibition and wo
man suffrage.
