five Democrat ' congressmen. Kxcept
in 1912 t hen the Democrats took ad
vantage of the Republican smash-up.
the 1916 victory meant more to the
Democrats than any previous Kansas
election. The mere fact that the Re
publicans swept the Democrat state
ticket off its feet, filled the state
house with Republicans and elected
both branches of the legislature,
means little to the Democrats. They
saved the postoffices and fat appoint
ments that have come to Kansas
Bourbons under the Wilson reign.
Now the Democrats will march and
yell and sing and make merry.
The narade is due to leave the
Thronp hotel shortly after 7 o'clock.

comfort rather than abuse the Hughes
supporters and that only soft and
tender words will be used by the
speakers. In short. Lardner has as

they may come to the meeting with

Chairman Lardner today urged all
supporters of Wilson to attend to
night's meeting. The meeting, he
said, would be a love foast of the men

who voted for Wilson.

stitutionality of the Adamson eight
hour law.
Announcement that the New Tork,
New Haven & Hartford railroad
would also file suits to test the consti

made today by Howard Elliott, the

Washington, Nov. 15. Attorney
General Gregory has decided that
suits by railroads against enforcement
of the Adamson eight-hour law will I
be defended by the department of Jus
tice. The defense to be presented in
each case will be worked out between
Solicitor General Davis and other offi
cials with United States attorneys in
various Jurisdictions.
The department today was unable to
determine whether it would be neces
sary to defend each of the many suits
announced to begin, or whether they
would be contented to make a test
case of one suit. No word has reached
the attorney general- from- the rail
roads suggesting such course and if
such a proposal is not made each suit t
will be defended. I
Reports that railroad brotherhood
officials had considered a suggestion I
that Mr. Gregory be asked to suspend
operation of the' Adamson law for
thirty days were met with the state
ment that the attorney general has
no such authority and that his only
course is to defend the suits or let
them go- by default.
Declares Law Unconstitutional.
Philadelphia. "Nov. 15. The Penn

the Adamson eight hour law.

New York, Nov. 15. The New
York Central railroad will file in the
federal court here the first injunction
suit to be brought by an eastern road
in this state to test the constitutional

was announced by Albert H. Harris,
general counsel for the New York
Central. The action will be directed
against H. Snowden Marshall, United
states district attorney here, end sev
eral local officers of the four train
men brotherhoods. A temporary stay
will be sought which would enjoin the
defendants from instituting prosecu
tions against the road to compel it to
carry out the law.
Two developments stood out promi
nently today in the new situation aris
ing from the forthcoming application
of the Adamson law. First, the an
nouncement that the managers of jthe
roads would probably apply for in
junctions against the law in every fed
eral district in the United States with
a separate suit in behalf of every one
of the 200 railroads in every district
which they enter. Should this step be
taken and the litigation involved run
the ordinary course of legal procedure,
the eight-hour law would be from" six
months to twoyears behind time in

PACT WITH HEX.?
Conference Reaches Mutual ,
Basis of Agreement.
Includes Withdrawal of U. S.
Army From Mexico.
Atlantic City, N. J., Nov. 15. De
spite indications of obstructionist
tactics on the Mexican side, the Ameri
can members of the joint peace com
mission here believed today there is
still a chance of reaching a border
agreement involving General Persh
ing's withdrawal.
While the apparent obstruction an
noyed the American group perceptibly,
one of its members said:
"The foundation has been laid for a
structure which we have excellent
reason to trust will take the form of
an agreement. And. while we have
come to something concrete, it is
nothing more than tentative. There is
now a situation wherein we come to
the criticisms which we trust will re
sult in a unity of mind."
Tentative Draft for Approval.
The Carranzista members had plan
ned to send the tentative agreement
to Carranza by messenger for ratifica
tion, while the Americans expected to
submit the proposals to the Washing
ton government by telegraph.
Whether the eleventh hour opposi
tion of the Mexican side will thwart
the expected agreement was impossi-
ble of prediction today. But the,'
Americans indicated that there will be
little dallying from now on.
In addition to the military agree-'
ment, the Americans hope for action
more iavoraoie to American investors,
such as the big mining interests.

Kansas Will Eat Cheaper White
Meat Than Usual.
SOARING IN OTHER STATES
Onjy Plutocrats Can Eat Gob
lers in East This Year. ,
Once More Prosperous Farmers
Are Held to Blame.
We'd better be glad we live in Kan
sas," said Frank Cope, one of the
largest local dealers in poultry, this
afternoon, concerning the prospect for
Thanksgiving turkeys this year. Kan
sas people, and particularly local peo
pie, are going to get their Thanksgiv
ing turkeys this year at a very small
advance in the price on last year's
birds, and there are going to be plenty
of birds to supply the demand. Factors
have been operating thruout the state
this year, to put the holiday fowl on
the table at a cost which will be lower
in proportion than that of the trim
mings, which go along with It.
Some of the factors: The drouth,
the high price of corn, and the natural
desire of the farmers to sell rather
than feed, when feed is high.
The drouth during the summer re
duced to an amazing extent the num
ber of grasshoppers, bugs and worms
which are the natural diet of the tur
key. The high price of corn makes
the farmer reluctant to feed it to the
birds, and as a consequence the birds
are to be dumped on the market in an
unfinished and undeveloped condition,
which makes them undesirable for the
packers who supply the hypercritical
eastern trade.
Local people will be able to eat tur
key cheap, but it won't be quite as
good turkey as it might be, on ac
count 01 the undeveloped condition of
the fowls, when they are sold.
Later in the season, too. the prioe
and the quality will go up together.
The turkey-raiser who goes to the
trouble and expense of feeding hia
birds till they are plump and In first
class condition, will demand and be
able to get a higher price than those,
growers who sell now.
"There won't be any 35 cent a .pound
turkey on the Thanksgiving table,'
says Mr. Cope, "but the peoole would
better eat their turkey, at Thanksgiv
ing, and be as contented as possible
with a sliehtly poorer grade, than wait
till Christmas."
Precisely the same factors have act
ed to keep the market for ducks and
geese down, and the latter may be
purchased during the early part of the
season at least, at exactly the same
price as last year's poultry
The chicken market is in the same
condition. Only a short time ago the
New York market, which ordinarily
consumes 110 carloads of chickens a
day, received 240 carloads, most of
the birds being undeveloped.
In New York.
New York, Nov. 15. Unless the
poultry dealers unexpectedly reduce
their present prices, only plutocrats
will "celebrate" Thanksgiving with
the gobbler this year. The price of
the festive bird to the ultimate con
sumer is now 34 or 35 cents a pound.
Farmers to Blame.
Dallas, Tex., Nov. 15. You're going
to pay more for your Thanksgiving
turkey this year because the average
farmer is too darned prosperous.
"The farmers Just aren't growing
'em this year." Ben Ablon. the big
gest turkey shipper in the country
said. "They've made too much mon
ey off their other crops to bother
about turkeys."

Most Important Success of Four
Months' Battles.
(Copyright, 1916, by the Associated
Press.)
With the British Army in France,
via London, Nov. 15. The British ad
vance along both sides of the Ancre.
which continued yesterday with the
capture of the village of Beaucourt, is
considered by the British commanders
as one of the most important successes
in the four months of the offensive.
They insist especially on the relatively
insignificant character of the German
resistance in a position which they
consider of great strategic importance
and one of the most highly fortified
on the entire western front.
More than 5,000 prisoners have been
collected in the extensive subterranean
galleries and chambers which were
sunk on both sides, of the valley and
were miles in extent. Five hundred
Germans surrendered in a tunnel near
St. Pierre Divion, which was a mile
and a half long. This tunnel gave ac
cess to scores of little chambers in
which companies of infantry were
housed and which contained machine
guns and bombs. Another seven hun
dred prisoners were caught in a ravine
south of Beaumont-Hamel, where they
were cut off by the first attack Mon
day afternoon.
Were Changing Troops at Time.
The British success south of the
Ancre was increased owing to the fact
that Germans in this sector were on
the point of being relieved by fresh
troops when the attack was launched.
The result was that twice the normal
strength of the garrison was trapped
by the enemy fire. Anions- th. nrionn.
era taken here were many men of the
Ninety-third infantry, of which the
j-ukb oi Aioany is nonorary colonel-in-chief.
The regiment lost heavily.
According to the prisoners, the
duke was waiting in the rear to in
spect the regiment when It left the
fighting line. The majority of the
infantry fighting was done with gren
ades instead of bayonets. The Brit
ish swarmed over the surface between
the trench lines and hurled showers
of bombs into the Germ .n dugouts
and shelters, capturing in quick suc
cession seven parallel rows of main
German trenches between Beaumont
Hamel and Beaucourt.
A Tank Does Destructive Work.
Prisoners from the Prussian guards
told the Associated Press correspond

they were cut off from their reserves
on an entire front of seven miles

all owners of automobiles to pay a
state mechanic license,, was urged this
afternoon by Ed Boh-er, president of
the Kansas Association of Black
smiths, Horseshoers and Wagonmak
ers. in his annual address delivered in
Topeka. The meeting was hejd in the

cans of Kansas." A vote on" the two
propositions probably will be taken
late this afternoon.
"Physicians, attorneys and men in
other professions are safeguarded by
legislation," said President Bohrer.
"Why not the garage men cf Kansa3.
They re willing to pay a license and if
the farmers owning Fords and other
cars are also obliged to pay a license
they will be only too glad to bring
their cars into a garage and have ex
pert work done on them."
In speaking of the contemplated
change of name of the association,
President Bohrer stated that the
blacksmiths are rapidly becoming a
curiosity and they are being torced
into the garage business. It is only
fair, he declared, that the garage men
be invited into the association.
Mayor Jay E. House, who is rapidly
gaining a reputation as a welcoming
orator, equal to Jim Dahlman, cowboy
mayor of Omaha, turned the keys of
the city over to the blacksmiths.
Prayer was offered by a minister, rou
tine business transacted and the con

Tonight the blacksmiths will get a
taste of high life when they are ini

"Entente's Last Card in Game i

Allies Hare Given Up Idea of

Berlin. Nov. 13. via London. Nov.
15. The opening of peace negotia
tions may perhaps be expected with
fair prospects of success in the course
of the coming winter, according to
Count Albert Apponyi, veteran Hun
garian leader and former Hungarian
premier. Count Apponyi, who is visit
ing Germany to deliver two addresses
on Hungarian history, expressed his
views in an interview given to a cor
respondent of the Associated Press In
which he discussed the general Euro
pean situation.
"We can not expect," he said, "to
see peace negotiations opened within
the next few weeks while the Ruman
ian campaign is still undecided. How
ever, I regard our chances for success
there as excellent and once Rumania
is crushed, I think both sides will be
willing to consider the question of
peace. Rumania was the entente's
last card and is proving a losing one.
We are massing a big army against
the Rumanians and I think that the
end will come shortly. Of course our
progress on the TrWsylvanian front is
a bit slow owing to the great difficul
ties of the country and particularly to
the deficiency in rearward communi
cation. These deficiencies are poorer
than in the west or even in Galicia or
Russia. However, the entry of Ru
mania into the war has in many re
spects been advantageous to us."
Posts Hope on Lord Grey.

"but such as Lord Grey and Chance.
lor von iietnmann-Hollweg for ex
ample." He suggested a comparison between
the utterances of the leaders a year
ago and at present. "Then," he said,
"their respective standpoints were as
far apart as the poles, but now altho
therev are still differences between
them they have most apparently
drawn nearer. The references to
crushing Germany have been elim
inated from the British pronounce
ments ana tne agitation for annexa
tion is dwindling in Germany.
Don't. Demand Belgium. .
"Chancellor von Bethman-Hollweg,"
he went on, "has pointed out in his
latest speech that he has never de
manded the annexation of Belgium.
"Such instances as these show in
my opinion that there are now no
really insuperable obstacles to the
opening of a discussion on future
peace. Of course the kingdom of Po
land must stand, but I believe Russia
can be brought to reconcile herself to
this, situation."
Welcomes Outside Influence.
Count Apponyi was asked If he
thought the i... pulse to start peace
discussions could 'come from within
the camps of the warring powers or
whether an outside impetus In the
form of a tender of good offices from
a neutral personage or power would
be necessary. He replied that he saw
no reason why neutral mediation
should not be welcome when the op

he knew no reason why President

Many officers-elect may be subject

there is some record work in filing
campaign expense accounts. Several
state officials have not filed their ex

The law governing the filing of ex
pense accounts Is most drastic. It was
enacted In 1916 and provides a fine of
$1,000 for violation, automatically va
cates the office to which a person may
have been elected and disqualifies
such person from holding office for a,
period of two years. Just now there
are a number of persons elected to
public offices who have failed to file
their campaign statements. The state
ments must be itemized. Candidates
for state office must file their expense
statements with the secretary of state,
while county candidates file with the
county clerk. Congressional candidates
are not affected by the state law. Un
der an act of congress, they file state
ments with the chief cleric of the
house.
Legislators Exempt.
Recently 8. M. Brewster, attorney
general, ruled that the state law did
not affect legislative candidates and
exempted both senatorial and repre
sentative candidates. There is a dispute-
eoncermng this opinion, however,
and many candidates who won places
in the legislature have taken the pre
caution to file statements. C there who
