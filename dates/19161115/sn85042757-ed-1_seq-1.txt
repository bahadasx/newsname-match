elected by carrying several of the far
western states. The decision was in
doubt until California swung into line
for Wilson which it c!id Frday. Wilson
carried all western states except Iowa
and Uregon, but in some instances the
majorities are so small thajt the official
count may change the state to Hughes.
However, there is no likelihood that
sufficient changes will be made to
change the final result.

GOOD PRICES FOR LIVE STOCK.
The live-stock situation thoughout
the world points to an era of good
prices for American-bred live stock.
Not only does it happen that Europe is
imuch more e sily and cheaply than
later when the roads are heavy and
the fields are soft from the tall and
winter rains.
The county has $1,500 dollars tied up
in the crusher and a few hundred dol

The house is republican but not
enough for a wonting majority. The
republicans have 218, the democrats
212 and there are six others scattered
among the socialists and progressives.
There are some contests in prospect
that, may change the complexion a few
votes, but which way the change will
be remains to be seen.
The senate is democratic by four to
six.
WILSON GETS POPULAR VOTE.
Conditions touching the popular vota
are more favorable tor President Wil
son this time than four years ago. He
was elected by a plurality only and
lost the popular vote by more than a
million and a quarter. This time he
wins the popular vote by probably over
400,(00. In past elections the winners
have received the majority ot the pop
ular votes as toi'ows: tyrant over
Greely in 1872; 762,991; McKin'ey over
Bryan in 1896, 601,864; McKinley over
Bryan in 1900. 947,790; Taft over Bry
an, 1,267,804; Roosevelt over Parker in
1904, 2.545,515, which is the largest
majority of the popular vote ever
given any president.
Thp popular vote for this year will
likely total 16,000,000, which is the
largest ever cast and is due in part to
the women having a vote in many
states.
IN TENNESSEE.
The state has gone democratic for
the entire state ticket, President Wil
son leading with a majority close to
35,000; McKellar defeated Hooper for
the Ur. i ted States Senate by about
25,000; Overall lost to Rye for govern
or by close to 30,000; Enloe for rail -
only had a majority of 2,000.
silence of Mr. Overall as to his
tude on the whiskey question doubtless
caused him to lose some votes.
LITTLETON DEFEATED.
Judge Moon defeated Jesse Littleton
for congress in the Third district by a
few hundred .votes. Mr. Littleton
is now mayor of Chattanooga and wiil
so remain instead of going to congress.
His defeat was very gratifying to
many republicans as well as democrats
for he ;.has stood for whiskey and
fought the republican party in the
state under Gov. Ben W. Hooper at the
time whtn it was most in need of aid
and encouragement.
JUDGE CORDELL HULL ELECTED
Judge Cordell Hull was re-elected
from this fourth district for congress
by a handsome majority, ln this coun
ty he received the largest vote of any
democrat on the ticket, even running
ahead of President Wilson and Gov.
Rye. Judge Hull is held in such hi -h
esteem by the people of this county as
a whole that he always receives a very
large vote. But for the difi'erei c in
the democratic and republican p-.iitie.s
on the tariff question Judge Hull
would come close to carrying the coun
ty over almost any opponent he is like
ly to have.
IN THIS COUNT.
Tne vote cast in this county was the
1,597, The heaviest vote pre vi 304 to
this W.B8 1,485. Th i voting was very
much along party lines and n"where in
the county was there much cross vot
ing. . At the irossviile precinct, there
were wore mixed tickets than at any
other precinct in the-county.
A. L. Garrison for state senate ran a
few votes ahead ot the ticket, while
all other candidates fell Jmore than 100
votes behind the head of the ticket, on
the demoratic side unci a lew votes be
hind on the republican side. Contrary
to expectations, Enloe for railroad j
commissioner did not losj many votes.
It was predicted at one time that he
Would not get 150 votes in the county,
hut the vote shows he ran only about
50 votes behind the other candidates,
excepting the head ot the ticket.
