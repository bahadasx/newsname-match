and Many Germans Killed—
5,000 Prisoner* Taken.
THE RUMANIANS LOSE AGAIN
Austrians Clear the Right Side of the
Danube of the Enemy—Quiet
Along Line in Italy.
The British drive began early Mon
day morning amid fog and rain in the
region of the Ancre river in Prance has
netted them aonther village, Beau
court, on the north bank of the Ancre.
The capture of this village makes three
that have fallen into British hands
since the advance began, the other two
being Beaumont-Hamel and St. Pierre
Hivion. There is no indication that
the offensive has ceased at any point
along the five mile front.
In the drive the British thus far
have taken more than 5,000 German
prisoners and, according to the latest
report, more captives are being
brought in.
Aside from the gains in the Ancre
region, the British also have made an
advance to the east of the Butte de
Warlencourt, about three miles south
of the important town of Bapaume.
To the south of the Somme the Ger
mans are busily engaged in shelling
French .positions in the region of Pres
soire and on the sector of Biaches-La
Maisonette, with the French vigorous
ly replying! On the remainder of the
front pniy bombardments have occur
red.
With comparative quiet, still reign
ing on the Russian and Austro-Italian
fronts, the Macedonian and Rumanian
frontiers cofitinue to be focal points
of interest. The Austrians near Or
sova and the junction of the Austrian,
Rumanian and Serbian frontiers have
cleared the right bank of the Danube
of Rumanians, a victory which prob
ably means a lessening of the impedi
ments the Rumanians have placed up
on the navigation of the river in this
region.
Again the Rumanians in the Alt val
ley of Transylvania have been pushed
back by the Austro-Gerinan forces,
who also have captured the village of
Bumbeshei in the Jiul valley and
forced the Rumanian left wing to give
way near DragoslaVle. In the north
the Russians have been compelled to
retire from the Geyergo mountains to
the Rumahian frontier.

GIVES DECISION
Case Involving Priority of Death of
August Meyer and Wife, Who
Were Killed in March, 1913.
MRS. MEYER OUTLIVED HUSBAND
Mrs. Heller, a Daughter, and a Broth
er, A. F. Meyer, Brought Action
to Se|t Aside Father's Will
People in this locality have been fol
lowing with interest the contest in
the district court involving the prior
ity of death of August Meyer, of Lake
View, and his wife, Henrietta Meyer,
both of whom were killed in the wreck
of a passenger train on the Unton Pa
cific near Qothenberg, Neb. in March,
1913. Jujge Albert, of Jefferson, lias
Just handed down a decision in this
cane, deciding that Mrs. Meyer out
lived her husband by several minutes,
and by this decision two of their chil
dren, Mrs. Minnie Heller and Mr. A.
F. Meyer, win their light lor their
distributive share ot their mother's
doVer third of an estate of ¥200,^00 or
more.
Rieyer and his wife were oil their
way home from California, where they
had spent the winter, and at Gothen
berg,, during the blizzard that raged
about March 13, the rea" """Hon "r
train plowed into the Pullman of the
fropt section, causing the death ui
foul- people, among whom were Mr.
and Mrs. Meyer.
By a will of Ihe husband the. two
children .mentioned, who received but
a small 'portion of the estate, will re
ceive their equitable proportion of the
dower Interest of the wife, their
mother, and this amounts to an un
divided two-fifteenth of about (500
acres of land in Crawford and Sac
counties.
The court holds that inasmuch as
the wife was still alive when picked
up. although she died before she could
be gotten into the. station at Got hen
berg, and the husband was dead when
tafeen out from under the wheels of
the engine which crashed into the
Pullman, and considering the fact that
his injuries appeared to be greater, it
was reasonable to determine that the
wife lived 'probably thirty minutes
longer. It wa3 thirty minutes after
the wreck before she was removed
from the car and she lived a very
short time after, although death came
while she was being carried into the
depot.
In the view of the facts brought
out, Mrs. Heller and A. F. Meyer
brought an action in the district court
to net. aside the will and make distri
bution'of the mother's interests as in
testate. They were opposed by other
heirs, Fraoz. A. Meyer, William H.
Meyer, Bertha Fredericka Doerfler.

Local Talent, Under Direction of
Miss Dysart, of Fairfield, Give
Very Creditable Entertainment
FOR BENEFIT OF EASTERN STAR
Both Entertainmente Well Attended
and Much Enjoyed—Order Will
Clear $300 As Result.
The Society Vaudeville, presented at
the Germania opera house Thursday
and Friday evenings of last week, un
der the auspices of the Eastern Stars,
was a decided success, ^nd on every
hand one hears compliments for the
excellent entertainment given. Both
performances were presented to pack
ed houses, and after paying all ex
penses the ladies of the Eastern Star
realized in the neighborhood of $300
for their efforts. We understand that
this money will be used to purchase a
victrola for the Eastern Star club
room.
Much credit for the success of the
entertainment is due to Miss Dysart,
of Fairfield, who was the director se
cured by the Eastern Star. Her work
was entirely satisfactory and the fact
that both entertainments were given
without a hitch of any kind shows that
she has had great experience along
this line. No better selection of tal
ent for the program could have been
made and all of those who took part
did themselves proud. It was a sur
prise to everyone that we have here in
Denison so much talent for an enter
tainment of this kind, and many of our
Denison people certainly could com
mand a high salary on the Orplieum
circuit.
The music was furnished by Barbor
ka's celebrated orchestra and the peo
ple of Denison are so familiar with its
high character that it is useless for
us to tell of the beautiful selections
rendered. The opening number was
probably the most interesting feature
of the entertainment. One hundred
school children dressed in white cos
tumes, marching across the stage
singing "Boogie-Boo," presented a
spectacle which will not soon be for
gotten. Eugene Eissman was soloist
and Lorenz Elvers led the chprus as
the Boogie-Boo man.
Ackley and Richairds' entertained
with several guitar and mandolin se
lections. They are artists on these
stringed instruments and- received
hearty applause.
Misses Martha Lehfeldt, Alta Schaf
er, Lucille Rollins, Margaret Aeblsch
er, Elizabeth Wearmouth and Maurine
Hamley. wearing Grecian costumes,
gave a beautiful dance. The young
ladies,were well trained and the effect
was most pleasing

which the following took part, Marie
Saggau, Esther Schnoor, Katherine
Woolston, Marie Hawley, -Opal Faus,
Abbie Anne McHenry, Maxine Robin
son, Edna May Simpson, Erma Rath,
Sarah Pfarr, Gladys Patterson and Al
maurine Gebert with Donna Marie
Dybbro and Juliana Virginia Bollen as
garland bearers, was very Impressive
and one of the best numbers of. the
evening.
Mrs. Geo. Sprecher, who is' already
well known to the theatrical circles
in Denison, presented a character
sketch which was a perfect scream."
Her first appearance was made in
Dutch costume and 'the second in a
ridiculous costume. Mrs. Sprecher
made a hit With the audience and re
ceived much applause.
One of the funniest numbers of the
evening was the sketch, "Around Deni
son in a Sightseeing Car." A six pas
senger Studebaker automobile, owned
by the Denison Auto company, was
driven on the stage by Charles 'Hem
ming, Jr.. and the passengers, Mrs. L.
B. Romans, Mrs. J. B. Romans, Miss
Jessie Goodrich, Spencer Heiden, J. A.
Mitchell, Mrs. P. F. Pfarr, Albert
Weiss, Mrs. C. M. Jensen. Professor
Elliott and W. C. VanNess, had the
time of their lives taking in Denison
from the "Rubber Neck" car. All of
the chief .points of interest of the city
were pointed out by Mr. Chsis. Bollen.
who never lost an opportunity t'o ex
aggerate them.
The Thespian quartette, composed of
Messrs. Sibbert, Tourtellot, Helsley
and Humphrey, sang several selec
tions which were highly appreciated.
Te ukulele quintette, made up of Ed
na Wright. Margaret Carey, Mary Lal
ly. Vern Stocking and Vere Menagh,
with Lenehan Lally as soloist, present
ed something new in the way of music.
The young ladies, were all artists on
the Hawaiian instrument and their
number was a rare treat to the people
of Denison. The Solos of Lenehan Lal
ly were received with the usual en
thusiasm displayed when he appears in
public.
Mr. J. V. Barborka appeared next on
the program with a beautiful harp solo
which delighted the audience.
Miss Margaret Christensen as Dr.
Tinker Tinker, and the Yama chorus,
made up of Martha Fastje, Ruby Faul,
Marie Weiss, Mildred Hubbell, Zella
Gillmor Fanchlon Ransom, Ruth Sti
letto, Madge Hultsch. Grace Hawley
and Beryl Faul, was one of the pleas
ing numbers of the program. The chor
us was well trained and equal to any
seen with the.big comic opera com
panies.
Another chorus, made up of Grace
Bamford, Bernice Osborn, Ella Hard
ing, Gene Miller, Marianna Sims, Bet
ty Shattuck. Albert Lyon, Charles
Lamberiy, Charles Richards, Charles
Kemming,' Professor Tourtellot and

able to find work there they walked
to Kenwood, where they hired out to
Mr. Vogt as corn pickers. Mr. Vogt
suspected something was wrong with
the three boys and brought them to
Denison and turned them over to the
county sheriff, who in turn notified
Mr. Rollins, the probation offlcert The
boys stated that they were partly In
dian, one of them being a half blood,
the other two being quarter blood's.
After a careful investigation was male
Mr. Rollins learned that they had
escaped from the government school
and a telegram was sent there an
nouncing that they were being held in
Denison.
Mr. Felix arrived at an early hour
Tuesday morning from Pipestone, and
stated that the boys h»4 escfVJ¥»donce
before from the school. They left on
the early train yesterday morning.
