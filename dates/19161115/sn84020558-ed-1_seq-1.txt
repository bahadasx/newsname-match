WORLD RECORD SEI 1 TRACK
All second-day attendance rece-ds were broken at the stats fair ysster
day afternoon, when the g?tes ooo-ied for trie passage of over 15.0C3 per
sons. This is the statement of Secretary T. D. Shaughncssy. who had evi
dently prevailed on the weather man to make good his promise of Monday
and provide warm, almost balmy weather.
The record crowd was entertained by the unusual spectacle of a broken
world's record, when Hemmett Queen, a fitly Qf just a year old, paced a
mile in 2:16'4- The previous record for a filly of this aqs was 2:183a.
Additional exhibits had been placid, and those already in their booths
had been straightened up. As usual, the second day passed with more
smoothness and pep. The races were called promptly, and the gorgeous ar
ray of free acts filled in the gaps.
Down town were held meetings cf the Teachers' institute, bringing to
the city an assemblage of men and women instructors from Maricopa,
Pinal, Yavapai, Pima and Yuma. Trt; Postmasters' association of the state
met and transacted
the business incilent to the opening flay ot their two-
day session.
Today is Indian Day - i
Nearly 201)0 students of the Indian
school will )rt:cipate in the various
events scheduled for the day. It in
expected that at least that number-j
will appear in the parade.
The ! v will be featured through
out by Indian sports of the old and
modem times. There will he pony
and foot races, matches of endurance
met skill for the women as well as
the men. t
It is Relieved that Indians from the
five sin roend'ng eounties will come to
this city in large numbers to watch
their kinsmen in action some to
watch their children perform feats
unkrown to the older members of the
various tnhes.
At i o'clock the Indian school bat- ;
talion will pass in view before the
judges' stand. Major General Crozier,

BRITiSR REPLY
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14. The I rit
Ish reply to the latest American note
of protest against the trade blacklist,
made public tonight by the state de
partment, denies that reports of neu
tral traders under international lav,
have been ruthlessly canceled, defines
the blacklist measure as a munio.pal
regulation plainly concerning the Rrit
isli government and Hntish citizens,
and contends that it is designed to
shorten the war.
The note fails to meet the American
demand that the names of Ameriean
firms be stricken from the blacklist,
but attempts to c-onvince the state de
partment that the British position is
Just and founded on law. It leaves open
the door for further negotiation, which
is exptected to follow.
The note was subscribed by Yiseount
G.ry. the British foreign miuisier. and
was addrc-'ed t and transmitted by
Walter Hines I'age. the American am
bassaileu at London.
A part which attracted mtirh official
notice douU with the tubjeet of peace,
based on the theory that one American
contention had been that there exists
no military necessity for the i.l.iciilist;
that i' in unnecessary for the alli to
prejudice neutral countries, ar.d tiiat
nothing which happens in distant neu
tral countries can influence the result
of the great conflict. 1
"If that rea!!v we-re the position."
says the note, "it is possible that the
measures take-n by His Majesty's gov
ernment might be described as un
called for, but it is not. He may well
wish that it were so. F en though
the military situation of the allies has
gratlv improved, there is still a lon
and bitter struggle in front of them,
and one wbieh m justice to the prin
ciples for which they ate fighting, im
peises upon them the duty of employ
ing every opportunity an 1 every meas
ure which they can legitimately use
to overcome their opponents.
' ' "One observation which is very com
monly he-ard is that certain belligerent,
acts, even though lawful, are too petty
to have any influence in a struggle of
such, magnitude. It Is. 1 know, diffi
cult for those who. have no immediate
contact with war to realize with wlv-it
painful anxiety men and women in this
country must regard even the smallest
incidents which tend to increase .if on
ly by a hair's breadth, the danger in
.which their redatives and friends dail.v
stand, or to prolong. If eudy for a min
ute, the period d irir.g which they are
to be exposed to such perils.
' "Whatever -inconvenience may be
caused to neutral nations by the exer-e-ise
of belligerent rights, it is not to
be contemplated for an instant to the
suffering and loss occasioned to man
kind by the prolongation of the war
even for a week."
In its argument the note points out
that German business house's through
out the world have fur 'JioM-d the e-ause
of Germany in the war. and have been
active agents "for the dissemination of
German political and social influence,
and for the purposes of espionage."
I "In sem cases," continued the note,
"they have been used eveVi as bases of
supply for German cruisers, and in
other tases organizers and paymasters
eif miscreants employed to destroy by
foul means, factories engaged in mak
ing, or rhips' engaged in carrying sup
plies required by the allies. Such op-
.eiations have been carried out in the

I do not think will be denied, that no
adequate action yet has been taken
by the government of the I'nited States
to suppress breaches of neutrality of
this particular commercial kind, which

countenance and deplore.
