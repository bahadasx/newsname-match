OFFENSIVE CONTINUES
To the South of the Somme the Germans Are Sehlling French
Positions in the Region of Pressoire, With the French

of Transylvania Have Again Been Pushed Back by the
Austro-German Forces On the Monastir Plain of Serbia
and North of the Cema River Troops of the Entente Al

Duels Prevail in the Austro-Italian Zone.
The British drive begun early Mon
day morning amid fog land rain in the
region of the Ancre River in France
has netted them another village
Beaucourt, on the north bank of the
Ancre. The capture of this village
makes three that have fallen into Brit.
Jab. hands since the advance began,
the other two being Beaumont-Hamel
and St. Pierre Dlvion. There is no in
dication that the offensive has ceased
at any point along the five mile front.
In the drive the British thus far have
taken more than 5,000 Germans pris
oners and according to the latest re
port, more captives are being- brought
in.
Aside from the gains in the Ancre
region, the British also have made an
advance to the ast of the Butte do
Warlencourt, abrfjt three miles south
east of the important town of Ba
paume. To the south of the Somme
the Germans are busily engaged in
shelling French positions in- tho re
gion of Pressoire and on the sector of
Blaches la Maisonnette with the
French vigorously replying. On the
remainder of the front only bombard
ments have occurred.
With comparative quiet still reign
ing on tho Russian and Austro-Italian
fronts, the Rumanian and Macedonian
theatres continue the focal points of
interest. The Austrians near Orzova
and the Junction of the Austrian, Ru
manian and Serbian frontiers have
cleared the right bank of the panube
MALE AND FEMALE WORKERS
IN JAPAN ARE ORGANIZING.
President of Laborers' Friendly Society
of Japan So Tell A. F. of L.
Baltlmore, .Nov. 14. Male ad female
workers In Japan are taking up the
organized lahfir movement with vigor,
Bunjl Suzuki, president of the Labor
ers' Friendly society of Japan, today
told the convention of tae American
Federation of Labor. During the last
eight months, he said, the membership
of the society he represented had in
creased from 10.0D0 to 80,000.
"Some Americans," the speaker con
tinued, "have mistaken ideas regarding
Japanese laborers on the Pacific coast
of the United States. These Japanese
have come to realize your ideals and
are rapidly approaching your standards
of living. As a result of my Investi
gations of the conditions of Japanese
laborers on the Pacific coast I finnd
that they are not onl on equal terms
with American workmen but in some
cases they are receiving higher wages
than their American comrades."
The federation delegates were urged
today by Thomas A. Stevenson, frater
nal delegate to the convention from the i
trades unions of Canada, not to in
dorse any legislation providing for
government investigation and settle
ment of industrial disputes. He said
that a similar law in the Dominion had
caused so m-ich dissatisfaction that
the trades unions and labor tongrcss
of Canada had vote-i nearly unani
mously to apply to the next session of
the Dominion parliament for repeal of
tho industrial disputes and investiga
tion act.
President Gompers today received a
telegram from Marcus A. Marks, pres
ident of the borouirh of Manhattan,
with reference to the proposed daylight
laving scheme. He referred it to a
committee which probably will report
n the matter to the convention.

' Washington, Nov. 4. President Wil

nize the support which the western
states gave in his re-election nnd at
the same, time pay the west the in

means a lessening of the impediments
the Rumanians have placed upon the
navigation of the river in this region.
Again the Rumanians in the Alt val

back by the Austro-German forces,
who also have captured in the Jiul
valley the village of Bumbeshli and
forced the Rumanian left wing near
Dragosravele to give way. Up in the
north the Russians have been com
pelled to retire from the Gyergyo
Mountains to the Rumanian frontier.
The situation in Dobrudja still re
mains to be clarified. Just what the
Russo-Rumanian troops and the forces
of the central powers are doing there
is not known. Berlin, Petrograd and
Bucharest say merely that the situa
tion is unchanged.
On the Monastir plain of Serbia and
north of the Cerna river troops ol the

Berlin.
Aside from artillery duels in the

activity along the remainder of the
line, quiet prevails in the Austro-Italian

or the nation s railways and their 400,

ward an adjustment of their new dif
ferences on the interpretation of the
Adamson eight hour law, was not re

the railway managers announced they
would fight the law to the end in the
courts while the brotherdood chiefs
who remained in the city left for their
homes, professing to believe that they
may safely rest their case with Presi

Both sides admitted that they could
not foretell the problem outcome of
the new controversy. The railroad

leaders are equally sure that the law

LETTERS BETWEEN SI. ROBERT
BORDEN AND SIR SAM HUGHES
Show That the Appointment of Sir
George Perley Caused Difference.
Ottawa Ont, Nov. 14. Letters ex
changed between Sir Roberf Borden,
Canadian premier. and Sir Sam
Hughes, whose resignation as minister
of militia was requested, were made
public here today. They showed that
tho appointment of Sir George Per-le-yas
Overseas minister of militia led
to the differences between the nremier
and sir Sam Hughes.
vniie in England last summer, it
was disclosed. Sir Sam appointed a
military council to manage Canadian
military affairs. Sir Robert Bordan,
it was said, held that Sir Sam Hughes
exceeded his authority. Then it was
that Sir George Perley was appointed
overseas minister of military with
out pay.
Sir Sam urged that Sir Max Aitken
be chosen for the post. The premier
declined and charged Sir Sam with
disregarding the principles of joint
responsibe government."
The premier resented an intimation
that he and Sir George Perley had se
cretely planned for an Overseas min
istry of militia and asked for Sir
Sam s resignation.
In forwarding the resignation Sir
Sam intimated that the Canadian pre
mier "wasted his time listening to the
complaints of disappointed people.
More than a year ago, he said, he un
derstood the premier "had it in con
templation to get Sir George Perley in
control in England."
Sir Sam declared in his letter to the
premier that there was no more need
for a separate minister of militia for
England than one for a military camp
in Canada. Finally ne regretted to
have "heard on excellent authority
that ypu had it in- contemplation for
some time to retire to the supreme
court of Canada by arrangement with
the -present incumbent of the chief
justiceship and hand over the. Cana
dian prime ministership to another
under whom it is well known I would
not serve." -
CABRERA REPUDIATES
PLAN OF BORDER CONTROL
Which Had Been Agreed on by the
Mexican-American Commission.
Atlantic City, N. J., Nov. 14. Repu
diation by Luis Cabrera today of a
plan of border control that had been
agreed on by two of his colleagues and
the three American representatives
again has made doubtful the ability
of the Americans on the Mexican
American joint commission to assist
Mexico in its efforts to restore normal
conditions along the frontier.
The Americans were hopeful tonight
that they might yet induce the Mexi
cans to agcee to what they believe
-teetion of life and property along" the
boundary, but it was indicated by
those in touch with them that further
opposition, characterized as quibbling,
would not long be tolerated.
There appeared reason tonight to
believe that unless tre chairman of the
Mexican commission adopted a more
tractable manner he and his associates
would be informed that further con
sideration" of Mexico's social, economic
and military problems must come to
an end.
BRITISH SEND TRIBUTE IN
. MEMORY OF CAPT. BOELKE
Wreath and Two Letters for "Chival
rous Adversary."
Berlin, Nov. 14. A wreath and two
letters from the Royal British Flying
Corps have been handed to the parents
of Capt. Boelke, the noted air lighter,
who was killed recently at the front in
France, says the Overseas news
Agency, which describes the sending of
these testimonials as follows:
"A British airman dropped a pack
age behind our lines with two Jetters.
One of the letters bore the inscription.
In memory of Captain Boelke, our
brave and chivalrous adversary The
Royal British Flying Corps.
The other letter runs: To the of
ficers of the German flying corps on
this front We hope that you v. ill find
this wreath and are sorry that it comes
so late. The weather prevented us
from ' sending it earlier. We mourn
with Captain Boelke's parents and
friends. We all recognize his bravery.
Kind regards to Captain Evan and

INCREASES IN COST
OF FOOD PRODUCTS
Are Likely to Be Subject of Investi
gation By Federal Trade Commission.
Chicago, Nov. 14. Increases in the
cost of food products are likely to be
the subject of an investigation by the
federal trade commission Edward H.
Hurley, chairman of the commission,
said here today the subject would be
considered at a meeting of the com
mission in .Washington Friday.
The high cost or the necessities of
life is the most important problem be
fore the American people today," he
said. ' "I believe it is within the prov
ince of the trade commission to inves
tigate and I think it more than likely
that we will hold meetings, determine
the reason for the present high costs
and apply a remedy if a remedy can
be found."
Mr. Hurley declared present coal
prices were suicidal and charged coal
aerators with wastefulness.
LONE BANDIT ROBS
OMAHA-LINCOLN EXPRESS
Obtained $96 and Then Wished His
Victims a Laughing "Good Night."
Kansas City, Mo.. Nov. 14. As the
Missouri Pacific's Omaha-Lincoln ex
press train No. 108 was leaving Leav
enworth, Kas., tonight for Kansas City,
Mo., a masked robber entered the
sleeping car, levelled a pistol at the
four male passengers and the conduc
tor, S. E. Schmitt, and obtained $96.
Eighty dollars was taken from the
conductor. The bandit then informed
his victims that they might resume
their seats, "I'll ride a piece with you,"
he said.
At intervals as one of the passengers
would shift his position, the pistol in
the robber's hand would shift to cover
him. . When the train, pulled into Kan
sas City, Kas.. the man wished his
victims a laughing "Good night," left
the car by the rear platform and dis
appeared. .
Slight Change in
California Count
NOT MORE THAN TEN VOTES ONE
WAY OR THE OTHER
MINOR GAIN LOSSES
Secretary of State McAtee Announces
There Are No Indications of Notable
Divergence ' From the ' Unofficial
Count.
- San Francisco, Nov.1 ft. ''The com
pleted count for California will not
show a difference of more than ten
votes one way or the ofner from fig
ures already given on the presidency,"
Sidney M. Van Wick, Jr.r chairman of
the democratic campaign committee,
announced here late today. He based
his assertion on examination of re
turns from all counties in which the
county clerks have completed their
work. '
Gains and Losses Counterbalance
Minor gains and losses seldom
more than a dozen votes in a precinct,
thus far have counterbalanced each
other, Mr. Van Wick said. He prom
ised a set of figures tonight.
At the headquarters of the republi
can presidential camipaign committee
it was said that returns from six coun
ties indiacted that interest centered
entirely in the divergence between the
vote for top and bottom electors on
the tickets. No predictions, it was
Baid, could be "made as to what this
might amount to.
"We have no startling information
of any sort," said Sylvester . McAtee,
secretary of the committee. "There
are no indications of notable diver
gences from the unofficial count. We
are simply counting to see what the
count develops."
CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD
SP4.IT CALIFORNIA'S VOTE.
If Total of Highest Republican Elector
Exceeds That of Lowest Democratic.
Sari Francisco, Nov. 14. Whether
the highest vote for a republican elec
tor in California was greater than the
lowest vote for a democratic elector
was about the only question of interest
to California politicians tonight. If
this should prove to be the case, the
state's delegation in the electoral col
lege may be split. The republicans
admittedly unearthed nothing in the
course of tne day to indicate for or
against such a prospect.
Sidney M. Van Wyck, Jr., chairman
of the democratic campaign committee,
worked all day bringing in . reports
from Httle counties, in the mountains
where ' the county1 clerks had finished
their count, and also succeeded in
getting cuie-Qr. two fair sized counties
tBar total for 20 -counties showed'tnat
the totals for the lowest democratic
elector in each ;ounty added 6,466
votes more than the totals for the
highest republican elector in the same
counties. This count would show, when
completed, the Wilson electoral vote
at its lowest ebb, Mr. Van Wyck said.
That is to 6ay. if the lowest demo
cratic totals are finally ahead of the
highest republican totals, a solid dele
gation in- the electoral college is as
sured. If the highest republican totals
exceed the lowest democratic totals,
this will not necessarily indicate that
any republican elector wins, because
the lowest democrat and the highest
republican are not the same, in all
counties.
Republicans and democrats alike
manifested surprise at rumors, trace
able in all cases 'to the east, that a
considerable error had been found
somewhere in tho state counting the
votes.
The mistake as reported would have
to be in San Francisco, Alameda or
Los Angeles" county, said Mr. Van
Wyck. "It is in none of them and so
far as we have been able,, to learn it
does not exist. The final count will
show no material change."
Reports from republican headquar
ters were similar.
HENRY FORD AIMS TO .
REVOUTIONIZE AUTO BUSINESS
That's Why He Wishes to Double or
Triple the Capacity of His Piant..
Detroit, Nov. 14. Henry Ford, on the
witness stand today at the Dodge in
junction hearing, declared that his
plans for spending many millions of
dollars to double or triple the capacity
of the Ford Motor Car Company's
plant, would probably revolutionize
the automobile business.
Ford admitted that he contemplates
expending millions of dollars to ob
tain ore deposits and more millions to
erect blast furnaces on the Detroit
River near Detroit. When his plans
are completed, he testified, his com
pany will be able to ship ore to its
furnaces and there make castings di
rect from the ore.
Ford, as president of his company,
is defendant in an injunction suit
brought by Horace E. and John F.
Dodge, local automobile manufactur
ers, to restrain him from using Ford
company's profits to develop its bus
iness. The Dodge brothers own ten
per cent of t F-J --'- and demand
that the profits, which now total abc
$50,000,00u, pun. in dividends.
They allege that Ford's plans to de
velop his company are "reckless and
unwise."
The hearing which began today is on
the motion to make the tmporary in
junction prmanent. The testimony
was given before a circuity court com
mission. BELGIAN CABINET SENT
TELEGRAMS TO KING ALBERT
Extends Felicitation on the Fete Day
of His Patron Saint.
Havre. Nov. ,14, 9.25 p. m. The Bel
gian cabinet, terming itself "the au
thorized organ of a nation condemned
to the silence of death," today sent to
King Albert o rfthe occasion of the
fete day of his patron saint a telegram
of felicitation. The message said the
present time was particularly painful
to their unfortunate country, as the
war . continued to be more and
odious and cruel.' Despite the suffer
ings of. the people, the message added,
the cabinet was confident of "a re
vengeful victory."
The members of the Belgian cham
ber of deputies also sent a congratu
latory telegram to the king. It likewise
1 condemned. . the ' acts of Germany in

New British Note
Defines Blacklist
A MEASURE CONCERNING ONLY
BRITISH GOVT. AND CITIZENS
MOVE TO .SHORTEN WAR
Note Fails to Meet the American De
mand That the Names of American
. Firms be Stricken From the Black
list. Washington, Nov. 14. The British
reply to the latest American note pro
testing against the trade blacklist,
made public tonight by the 'state de
partment, denies that rights of neutral
traders under international law have
been ruthlessly cancelled, defines the
blacklist measure as a municipal reg
ulation plainly concerning only the
British ' government and British citi
zens and contends that it is designed
to shorten the war.
, Fails to Meet American Demand.
The note fails to meet the American
demand that the names of American
firms be stricken from the blacklist,
but attempts to convinoe the state de
partment that the British position is
just and founded on law. It leaves
open the door for further negotiation,
which is expected to follow.
The note was subscribed by Vis
count Grey, the British foreign min
ister, and was addressed to and trans
mitted by Walter Hines Page, the
American ambassador at London.

WOMAN HAD FACULTY
FOR BORROWING MONEY
Miss Annie E. Sharpley Got. $80,000
Without Security.
Chicago, Nov. 14. Miss Annie E.
Sharpley, who borrowed $30,000 from
wealthy Chicagoians without security 1
by her mere ppwers of persuasion, ad- I
mitted today she was the same Annie I
CI.n.l... . I . A i. '
.JUm pic J VYUU UI1LC WcLS t?Ill. LU llltS
federal penitentiary from Philadelphia
for forgery. Miss Sharpley's affairs
became public after she filed a petition
in bankruptcy scheduling $80,000 -in
debts and declaring that her extensive
poultry farm from which she sold egga
to many wealthy families here, had
been sacrificed to her longing to have
produced a, play she had written,
"Lights Ahead."
Today she admitted that her adven
ture in theatricals had cost her only
$800 and that she had never dealt,
witlj. the New York producer, but with
an xmpostOT who- had defrauded her.
Among Miss Sharpley's creditors are
Mrs. T. B. Blackstone, who signed
notes for $47,000 for her, and Herman
Cohen, a pawnbroker, who declared
he had loaned her $20,000 without se
curity. Cohen finally took over the
poultry farm as security for $4,000 of
the loan. After this Miss Sharpley
borrowed $350 from him, he said, "to
pay the first month's rent on the .farm.
Miss Sharpley said the money sh
had obtained by her forgeries as well
as the amounts she borrowed in Chi
cago had gone for the support of an.
Englishman whom she had loved 1 in
her girlhood and who had sinct- lived
on the money she had been able to
make. He was killed recently in bat
tle, she said. )
The same persuasiveness that ena
bled Miss Sharpley to borrow large
amounts has prevented any of her
creditors from taking action against
her, it was said. Cohen, after listen
ing to her story today, announced that
he would stand by her and Mrs. Black
stone said shebelieved thoroughly in
her honesty and was prepared to lend
her even move money if necessary.
Miss Sharpley said she could repay the
loans if given time.
CHAMP CLARK CONFERS
WITH DEMOCRATIC LEADERS
Not Willing to Concede Republican
Plurality of Five in House
Washington, Nov. 14. Champ Clark,
Speaker of the house, reached Wash
ington today and conferred, with dem
ocratic leaders regarding the congres
sional election which, according to the
latest unofficial returns .leaves control
;f the next house in doubt. The
Speaker first conferred with Repre
sentative Doremus, of Michigan, chair
man of the democratic congressional
committee, who predicted, despite un
official returns indicating the election
of five more repubilacsn than demo
crats, that the final canvass would give
the democrats control and that the
Speaker would be re-elected.
On the other hand. Representative
Woods, of Iowa, chairman of the re
publican congressional committee, was
insisting that complete returns would
show republican gains instead of loss
es and that republicans would dictate
the organization of the house.

New York. Nov.. 14. The adoption
of the daylight saving plan by setting
the clock forward one hour in the
United States, through publio concur
rence, from May 1 to fesptemoer in,
1917 will he considered at a national
daylight saving convention to be held

To Ask Support of Railroads.
The American Railway Association
has been asked to lend its support and
will- consider the project at its semi
annual meeting here tomorrow. A re
port drawn up by a committee headed
by B. B. Thomas, president of the Le
high "Valley Railroad, will be submit

DEPORTATION OF BELGIAN
CIVILIANS INTO GERMANY
Has Reached Serious Proportions
Stats Department to Protest.
Washington, Nov. 14. Deportation
of Belgian civilians into 3ermany for
i inv,n. i c Tn ') . i rA n(), serious

proportions that American Charge
tirew at JBernn nas oeen uircuvcu "j
the state department to take the mat
ter up personally with Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg. The charge was
requested to say that such, deportations
could not but have a mosT unfortunate
effect, on neutral opinion, particularly
in the United States, which has the
welfare of the Belgian civilian popu
lation very much at heart-.
The instructions, it was learned to
day, grew out of a long report from
Charge Grew in which he stated that
he had discussed the situation infor
mally and unofficially with Under-Secretary
of Foreign Affairs Zimmerman.
The latter admitted that a definite pol
icy had been adopted to enforce the
labor of Belgians in cases where they
would net work voluntarily, on the
ground that so many refused to work
as to maUe a strain cn public charity
intolerable.
The deportations are viewed here
not only as a violation of international
law, but in a degree as a violation of
Germany's assurances to Ambassador
Gerard last June, which, though relat
ing to the 20,000 French women and
girls deported from Lille, Roubaix and
Tourcoing, are felt to be applicable to
the Belgian situation. .
At that time when Mr. Gerard had
gone to general headquarters in France
to discuss the attack on the Sussex
with Emperor William, assurances
were given by the Germans that no
further deportations would be made.
The case of the Belgians is considered
identical in principle.
