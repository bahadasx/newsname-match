In district court late this afternoon,
Issued an order calling upon District

New York, Nor. 16. Three great
eastern trunk line railroads will hare
Joined, within the next few days, with
the great western railway systems
ot the country, In concerted fight
upon the Adamson eight-hour law.
The Pennsylvania railroad filed Its
suit for an Injunction against opera
tion of. the law at Philadelphia to
day. The New York Central la ex
pected to Join In a petition to be
filed here late today. Within the
next few days the New York, New
Haven ft Hartford will Institute sim
ilar proceedings at Boston.
This will be the answer of the rail
road! to the challenge ot a general
strike January 1, made by the rail
road brotherhoods. The petition to
be filed by the New York Central will,
It Is understood, be patterned after
that Institute by the Santa, Fa , rail
road la the first of the legal obstacles
whloh the railroads are seeking to
place in the way ot enforcement of
the elght-bonr law. .
New York, Nov. 15. Managers
representing the .greatest of the 'pa
ttoa's rail lines dug deeply again to
day Into the Adamson eight-hour
measure. Their purpose was not on
ly to get Its Intricacies, cleared, but
likewise to establish. If possible, a
basis for its operation more favorable
than they now foresee. Meantime,
their attorneys planned rapid steps In
filing actions against the government
as test cases.
While only one case may be used as
a test, all roads will be Involved, so
that, the penalty clause will not re
act against them.
All the brotherhood leaders hsd
quit New York, but all Indications
pointed to a willingness on the man
agers' part to talk business with the
union heads, though perhaps not on
terms suitable to the unions.
The union attitude Is that the rail
roads, are trying to evade the spirit
of the law, and that any concessions
must come from the transportation
heads'. It Is likely that the union
men will lay their side before Presi
dent Wilson next week, though appar
ently t he situation Is not such yet as
to need any action from the president.
Brotherhood leaders Insist the1 will
go through with their strike threat
on New Years If the ratlro.tds quibble,
or If court decisions einas'lnte the
eight-hour program.
