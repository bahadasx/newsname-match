[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Nov. 1.—Managers
representing the greatest of the na
tion's railways dug deeply again to
day Into the Adamson eight hour
measure. Their purpose waa not only
to get its intricacies cleared, but
likewise to establish, If posslbla, a
basis for its operation more favor
able than thay now foresee. Mean
time, their attorney* planned rapid
steps In filing actions against the
government as tesc opes.
While only one case may be used
as a test, all roads will be involved
so that the renalty clause will not
react against them.
All the brotherhood leaders had
quit the city, but indications pointed
to a willingness on the managers'
part to talk business later with the
union heads—though perhaps not on
terms suitable to the unions.
The New York Central railway
planned to be ths first of the eastern
railways to enter a suit Papers were
practically re*dy for fllin* tete today
while the Peririsylvaiila knd other
lines planned eerly similar action.
One of the chief contentions of
these suits is that the Adamson law
violates the filth amendment by
"arbitrarily and unreasonably" de
priving the roids of their liberty of
contract and pirperty without due
process of law that It discriminates
against certain railway workers and
that It inflicts enormous penalties.
The union attitude is the railroads
are trying to at old the spirit of the
law and that any concessions must
come from the transportation heads.
It is likely the men will lay their side
before President Wilson next week,
though apparently the situation is
not such yet aB to need any action
from the president.
Brotherhood leaders insist they will
go through wi»h their strike threat
on New Year's if the railways

The fear grew out of the admission
that deporting of Belgians into Ger

tbe state department has taken thet
