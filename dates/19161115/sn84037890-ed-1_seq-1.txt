Wilson and Marshall Elected
House of Representatives in Doubt-Senate Democratic
s
California has gone for Wlbon by
a majority of 3,000 which clinched
the victory for Democracy. Wilson
carried thirty States, Hughe3 eeven
tccn, with Minnesota yet In doubt.
Wilson received the solid vote of tho
South and nearly the entire Wost
-with the State of Now Hampshire
also In lite column.
In the' largest vote ever cast In tin
oleotlon In the United States Presi
dent Wilson was given an estimated
popular majority over Hushes of
4'03,302 vote3. For the two leading
Presidential candidates, Mr. Wilson'
and Mr. Hughes, 10,724,114 votes
were cast en Tuesday. This num
ber does not Include the vote given
the Socialist, Socialist-Labor or Pro
hibition candidates.
Allowing .the candidates on these
three- tickets- the ranta naniVssoi.
votes the candidates received hi
1912 It is estimated that the total
mifi vote will be 17 002,111. It is
more than probable that thte vot
will chow an incrense-aiuf tho grand
- total vote thl3 year w:il pans 18,
COO.OOO, an increase of 3,00,000
durirj; the past four years.
The popular vote shows how
great was President Wilson's victo1
ry. In 1012. the combined voto of
Mr. Taft mid Mr. Roosavclt was 1,
.".14, 239 greater than tjhat of Mr.
Wilson. In 19 1G President Wilson
wiped out this lead and passed it by
403,000 votes.
The House.
Members of the House of Repre
sentatives in the newly elected Six
fifth Congress face themost uncer
tain organization, situation In the
history of the Government.
- With a few districts still In doubt
tho Republicans appear to have a
plurality of four or five members
and a possible majority of two or
three when it Is figured that an In
dependent elected In Massachusetts
and a Progressive elected In Minne
sota probably will voto with them
forv organization purposes. Inde
pendence of action has characterized
a number of the re-elected members
on the Republican Nslde, however,
and their atltude toward Democratic
legislation In the last few years has
given" Democratic leaders cause' for
hope that some of them might carry
their Independence Into the organi
zation of the next House..
On" the face of the unofficial re
turns the political division of the
House Is so close that an effective
and certain working majority does
not exist. While there might be a
few changes when tho official re
turns are counted, the chances are
that these would not materially al
ter the goneral result.
The Senate.
But even In the event that the
"House Is Republican after the offl
xdal count Is made, the Republican
' cannot control legislation In the
Blxty-flfth Congress because the
"Senate will bo Democratic by a safe
-working majority of twelve. The
'Senate, according to tho latest fig
ures will consist of C4 Democrats
and 41 Republicans .with one Sena
tor from New Moxlco yet In doubt.
