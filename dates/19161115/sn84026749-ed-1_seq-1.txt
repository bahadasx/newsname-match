WHOLE COUNTRY SHIVERS
Situation Worries Government
Officials and Heads of Busi
ness Houses.
First snow of the season fell In Wash
ington today.
Moro snow Is expected tonight and the
fall may reach the proportions of a
nowstorm.
Washington faces the prospects of
oold and snow with a continuing short
ego In Its soft coal supply.
Theso throe facts formed a combina
tion that worried Government officials,
heads of big business houses and office
building, and superintendents of apart
ments. In- tho face, of what they consider too
much talk about tho scarcity of coal
tho dealers of Washington havo pledg
ed themselves not to discuss the coal
situation.
Say Agitation Creates Panic.
They reached this conclusion In the'
belief, they state, that the continued
agitation of the coal shortago was cre
ating a panic which made for tho unduo
buying of coal.
Some time ago It wns admitted the de
mand of buyers was heavier than re
ceipts of coal here. Whether moro Is
being burned in Washington now than
, Is being rccolved cannot bo determined.
Many believe it Is and the effort to lay
In soft coal has grown apace In tho last
two davs of prospectlvo coal and
snow.
At the two Washington freight
yards It was stated by freight agents
that every effort Is being made to re
more coal as soon as It com- In.
' Empty Cars Fast.
Records show that, while dealers
are allowed forty-eight hours with
out being penalized to romove their
eoal. many of them are getting
It .away twelvo hours after arrival,
and most of them within twenty-four
hours.
The District has enough coal to last
until the first of next week. This
means that the schools and the Dis
trict building, the Jail. Washington
Asylum Hospital, and other District
institutions are provided for during
that period.
Government departments are running
olote to a coal famine, but the Govern
ment can commandeer coal for Its use.
All Seek Supply.
Tho apartment houses, office buildings,
and big business houses are the ones
who are seeking every opportunity to
lay In a supply against a still greater
shortage.
Washington coal dealers resent the as
sertion that they are not using every
effort to get coal from oars to consumer.
It was stated the transportation situa
tion Is slightly better here now. When
coal con be loaded at all, It comes
through from West Virginia mines. It
was stated, In from five to seven days,
which Is quick time for coal.
Washington dealers and officials of
railway companies hero assert that
Washington Is ob well off, it not bet
ter, than other cities.
Situation Is General.
The factors In tho nresent shortage
of soft coal, they assert, are general.
Some of these factors, agreed upon by
railway agents and by tho dealers, and
summarized in their trade Journals, are
these:
Lack of enough cars by the railroads
to carry coal enough to meet the pres
ent demand.
Tremendous Increased use of coal In
nlnnm now manufacturing munitions.
and other factories running at full tilt.
Increased use of coal by railroads In
effort to transport Increased manufac
turing output.
Difficulty with labor at tho mines,
Including the shortage of tho Influx
of European workers, and the higher
prices for labor, which cause the
"button strikes" and other labor
troubles.
Home Owner Is Safe.
The small home owner still Is un
aisalled, as there Is no shortage In
anthracite coal. 'It Is predicted In some
quarters wider use of anthracite, be
cause of the shortage In bituminous
ooal, may bring about shortage In the
former. Anthracite may be bought In
large quaultltlOM now.
Big coal dealers In soft ooal are al
lotlng what Is coming In Incompara
tlvely small quantities.
This morning snow was threatened
and bleak winds added to the discom
fort of pedestrians. At 11 o'clock the
mercury stood at M degrees, and by
noon It was only one degree higher,
where It stood at 1 o'clock.
Lower Temperature- Probable.
The Indications are for still colder
weather tonight. Tho cold lost night
baused Inroads on coal piles of office
buildings and apartments.
The situation will be further nggra-
rated in case of a heavy snow storm,
because delivery teams of dealers are
taxed to tho utmost delivering small
orders, Instead of delivering large quan
tities, as Is customary.
If a heavy snow should come, the dif
ficulty of maintaining delivery of many
small orders, would cause Increased dli
oomfort. The cold wave Is partly duo to a
tropical storm off the West coast of
Florida, it is stated. Anticipating
high winds along the Atlantic coast
tonight, the Weather Bureau has or
dered storm warnings placed from
Cape Henry southward to Florida.
The cold wave Is expected to con
tinue for several dnys, nnd Indica
tions are that the weather will re
main unsettled for at least 30 hours.
There Is no probability of any iipptt
clable amount of snow, It U stated.

HEARING SET FOR DEC. 6
Effort by "Master Spy's" Coun
sel to Secure His Release Is
Defeated.
Dr. Karl Armgaard Graves, the "In
ternational spy," was given a respite
todny when United States Commis
sioner Anson Taylor postponed for
three weeks the case In which Graves
Is charged with attempting to extort i
money from the German embassy for ,
roiinquisning letters to tne countess
von Bernstorff and other embassy
mall. I
The case was postponed at the re
quest of the United States Govern
ment, to give Prince von Hatzfeldt,
who set the trap resulting In Graves'
arrest, time to obtain permission
from his government to prosecute.
Bond Is Renewed.
An effort of Graves' counsel to ob
tain the release of the prisoner pend
ing trial was defeated. Commission
er Taylor renewed Graves' bond of
$2,000 until April 6, when tho ciiae Is
set for preliminary. hearing.
Graves and his personal counsel,
John J. Halllgan, of New York, re
turned to New York this afternoon.
Attorneys for the so-called "master
spy" hailed the postponement as evi
dence that the Government has no case
against Ornvrs. and Is compelled to ob
tain the aid of the German government
In the prosecution.
Prosecutors Jubilant.
Federal prosecutors refused, however,
to admit they had no case. On the con
trary they appeared JuWlant that Prince
von Ilntzfel'dt had agreed to appear.
Count von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, has cabled his government for
permission to have the embassy repre
sented at the court proceedings. The
delay In the case was necessary, be
cause It will require two or three weeks
to got Berlin's reply. "
Dr. Graves, calm nnd debonair as ever,
displayed little Interest In the proceed
ings In Commissioner Taylor's office this
morning,
Ho was accompanied by his personal
couniel. Mr. Halllgan, and by P. II.
Marshall, assistant corporation counsel
of the District, and Roger J. Whlteford,

whom he has retained.
Proceedings Brief.
The proceedings In Commissioner Tay
lor's office occupied but a few minutes.
There was a brief conference between
opposing counsel at which agreement
for. the continuance was reached.
Graves' counsel read the two warrants
charging Graves with bringing stolen
letters into the District and. attempting
to extort money for release of these
letters.

Necessary Conditions.
"The reason for this Is that certain
conditions must be compiled with to ob

"Mrs. Scherer said she thought her
assallnnt woro a cap, but that was the
nearest she could come to a descrip

The police are convinced1 that the
two white men who held up l.uthcr A.
Acker, a clerk, at Tenth Mreet and
Massachusetts avenue Saturday night,
nnd Allen C. Jummcson, a grocer. In
his storo at 12i Four-and-a-half street

CHICAGO MIGHT GET
WOMAN POSTMASTER
Mrs. George Bass Considered as
Compromise Candidate.
CHICAGO, Nov. IB. Is Chicago to be
the first big American city to have a
woman for postmaster? It has- been
contended that this would he a fitting
recognition by tho Administration of
the women of the nation's greatest
suffrage city.
Now come reports fioin local Demo
cratic circles that Mrs. George Bnss
Is being favorably considered for tho
successor to Postmaster D. A. Camp
bell, who has retained tho office
t. -ough tho whole Of tho Wilson Ad

local Democratic factions to agree on
a new name.
It Is said Mrs. Bnss' name may bo

The work that Mrs, Bnss has per
