Gregory Announces Defense in
Railroad Suits,
LEGAL BATTLtE INDICATED
Managers Favor Concerted
Court Action.
WASHINGTON. Nov. IS. Attorney!
General Gregory has decided that suits!
by railroads against enforcement of the'
Adamson eight -hour law will be de-l
fended by the department of justice
The detense to be presented in eachi
case will be worked nut between Solici-I
tor Ceneral Davis and other officials!
with I'tiited States attorneys in va'ious'
jurisdutmns (f
Number of Suits Uncertain.
The departtnent today was unable to
determine whether it would be nec
essary to defend ea h of the many suits
announced to begin, or whether they
would be contented to make a test case
of one suit. No word has reached thv
attorney general from the railroads sug
gesting Mich a course, and if such a
proposal is not made, each suit will be
defended.
No Such Authority.
Keports that railroad brotherhood cf
fii ials had considered a suggestion that
Mr. Gregory be asked to suspend oper
ation of the Adamson law for thirty
days were met with the statement that
the attorney general has no such au
thority and that his only course is to
defend the suits or let them go by de
fault. Railroad Managers
Favor Legal Action
NEW VOKK. N. Y, Nov IS.-Rail-sva)'
managers comprising the "nation
al conference committee" continued to
day consideration of whether wholesale
legal action to defeat the Adamson 8
hour law will be taken or whether a
limited series of injunctions will be
filed. The concensus of opinion was
said to favor the former course which
would result in approximateTy""5,rj00
actions, covering the entire railroad
territory of the United States. The
cases are expected to be in the courts
within ten days.
In view of the fact that the New
land's committee is to hold public
hearings on the railroad situation gen
erally beginning next Monday, there
was an indication that definite action
would be postponed, until the conclu
sion of these hearings.

LANKFORD PLANS
TO STRENGTHEN
GUARANTY LAW
Commissioner Is Preparing a
New Rule for State Banks.
A plan to strengthen the Oklahoma
state bank guaranty fund is embodied!
in new rules and regulations, gov
erning banks under the supervision of
the state banking department, which
State Rank Commissioner, I. D. Lank
ford was preparing todav to issue.
Rule Effective Soon.
According to the new rules, which
are to become effective on November
22. all state banks which are not clas
sified as approved reserve agents and
all banks having a capital stork of
$S0,0()0 or less will be required to car
ry at least 50 pefeeut of their legal
reserves with banks operating under
the Oklahoma state hankinc system.
The operation of this rule will pre
vent state banks, if so Inclined, from
depositing their reserve in national
banks or in banks out of the state to
avoid the bank guaranty assessment.
It will result in all reserve funds be
ing held in state banks in Oklahoma
and subject to the bank guaranty fund
assessment.
Lankford Makes Statement.
"If, since the guaranty law became
effective, state banks of Oklahoma had
carried tlieir reserves nd balances
with banks under the same suervi
sion, the guaranty fund today would
be better off by over a quarter of a
million dollars,' said Mr. Lankford.
A circular letter, promulgating the
new rules will be sent to every stata
bank in Oklahoma tomorrow.
FOOD VALUES OF
MILK SOLD HERE
WILL BE TESTED
Increase in Price Causes City'
to Inspect Dairy Product.
Now that some of the local dairies
have advanced the price of milk to 12'
cents a quart, A. A. Doughty, city milk
inspector, wants to know it (till tood
value is being given.
Samplea Collected.
Thia morning Dr. Doughty collected
samples front the Helle Isle, White
House, E. A. Tarnian. V. Peterson, Oak
Idge and Peaster dairies for the pur
pose of having the city chemist make an
analysis of the product as regards nu
triment and purity.
Dr. Doughty says that he anticipates
a general increase in the cost to the
consumer of all dairy products on ac
count of the high price of feed.
Failure Predicted.
"Many dairymen in Oklahoma Citv
are due to.go out of business this year,1'
say the milk inspector. "The class that
sell milk to the poorer familie are
doomed to bankruptcy, in my ftpinion,
because they cannot raise the price
enough to offset the cost of feed and at
the lame time maintain their clientele."

WINTER ACTION EXPECTED
Count Cites Year's Changes
in Attitudes. ,
P.F.Kl.IN. Nov. 15-The opening o!
peace negotiations mav perhaps be ex
pcrted with fair prospects of success in)
the course of the owning winter, ac
cording to Count Albert Apponyi, vet
eran Hungarian leader, and former
Hungarian premier. Count Apponyi,
who is isitin? Germany to deliver two
addresses on Hungarian history, ex
pressed his views in an interview gvert
to a correspondent of the Associated
Press, in which lie discussed the gen
eral F.uropean situation.
After Rumania la Crushed.
"We cannot expect," he said, "to sea
peace negotiations opened within tho
next few weeks, while the Rumanian
campaign is still undecided. However,
I regard our chances for success there
as excellent, and once Rumania is
crushed, I think both sides will be will-
ing to consider the question of peace. ?
Rumania was the entente's lasf card and '
is proving a losing one. We are mass
ing a big army against the Rumanian
and I think that the end will coma
shortly.
"The entry of Rumania into the war
has in many respects been advantageous
lo us."
Recent Speeche of Stataraea,
To illustrate what he regard a tha
improving chances for peace negotia
tions. Count Annonvi r(rrH In r-n
speeches of statesmen in the opposing
camps.
"Not Lloyd George, of course," he in
terjected, parenthetically, "but such at
I-ord Grey and Chancellor von Beth
mann-Hollweg, for example." He sug
gested a comparison between the utter
ances of the Icadrs a vear ago and al
present.
Change la Viewpoint.
"A year ago," he said, "their respec
tive standpoints were as far apart a
the poles, but now although there ara
still difference between them they
have most apparently drawn nearer.
The references to the crushing of Ger
many have been eliminated from ths
Rritish pronouncements and the agita
tion for annexation is dwindling ir
Germany.
"Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
has pointed out in his latest speech
that he has never demanded the annex
ation of Belgium. Such instances as
these show, in my opinion, that there
are now no really insuperable obstacles
to the opening of a discission of fu
ture peace. Of course the Kingdom of
Poland must stand, but I believe Rus
sia can be brought to reconcile herself
to this situation."
Mediation I Favortd.
Count Apponyi was asked If ha
thought the impulse to start peace dis
cussion could come from within tha
ramps of the warring powers, or
whether an outside imnehis in I bo (nrm
of a tender of good office from a neit
tral personage or power would be nec
essary. He replied that he saw no rea
son why neutral mediation should not
be welcomed when the opportune mo
ment to whirh he had referred should
arjive and added that he knew no rea
, , .
ion wny i resident vvnsnn snould not
be acceptable as an intermediary.
"We felt, of course." he said, "that
President Wilson has not treated ua
fairly and that he has departed from
Ihe way of strict neutrality. But even
though one does not like a person, that
is no reason for rejecting his servicea
when they may be useful."
Menace of Russia.
The Hungarian statesman believe
that the war should not only end be
cause of what he regards as the fu ility
of further hostilities, but because of hi
expressed conviction as to the menace
of Russia. He declared that the west
ern states of F.urope must band them
selves together for defense against
Russia, which country he rharacterired
s the great menace to the future peace '
of Hurope and the world. In his opin
ion France's efforts to regain Alsace
Lorraine are doomed to failure and
France may as well reconcile herself
to peaceful relations with her eastern
neighbors. He holds that Great Brit
ain has made an abortive effort to
crush Germany as a trade rival by ap
peal to arms, hut there is nothing es
sential in the rhararter of the three na
tions to prevent their union as friends.
