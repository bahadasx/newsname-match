turning no benefits to the community.
Orders have been pouring In upon
Antonio Scallse, owner and operator
of the Columbia factory, so rapidly of
late, and tho quality of bis specialty
ware is becoming so generally known,
that tbe erection of another and more
modern factory is now being considered.
The latter part of tills week, officials
of the Monongahela Railway are
coming to confer with Mr. Scallse concerning
a site for his factory near their
lines. H Is likely that this site will
be well out toward East Park.
The difficulty to bo overcome by the
Colombia company is the securing of
material from the railroad, and getting
the ware back to a shipping point.
Orders now in the hands of the company
call for the shipping of several
car loads of ware each week. Tbe
present location of the factory makes
It necessary 10 haul this amount of
ware to the station In wagons. An
vabomlnahlc condition of the streets In
tbe locality of the Columbia makes It
alvnnel ImnnveihU fn rln this onH fha
moving of the factory aorms the only
solution.
The Columbia glass company Is now
flooded with orders, assuring them
markets for more glass than they ever
before attempted to produce. Practically
all of the colli cream jars and
ointment pots for the Sanitol company,
oold cream jars for l>r. Sayrnans beauty
cream, made In Indianapolis, all the
lire and bottles used by the Peroxide
Specialty company, decorated eggs and
glass novelties for the MrCrory Five
and Ten cent stores, similar novelties
for the Kress Five ar.d T<n cent stores,
are some of the Ihings supplied In the
'cross the river plant.
There are now h-tweeu fifty and sixty
men employed by the company and
When the expansion plans are carried
out this nnuiher will be Increased at

A blue-eyed. three-year-old girl registered
at St. Peter's orphanage as Valda

Mrs. ollie Randln Trttmiipr says she i
Is tho child's h^tl mother Slip has j
hern charged wiW kidnaping tho baby
from the orphanage.
Mrs. I.ena Purvis Wahlqulst Is the
other claimant.
The only plea 011 either side is mother
love.
According to testimony. Mrs. Trtint- j
per got the child front the orphanage ,
on probation.
Then the juvenile authorities took i
Valdn from Iter.
Acmnnnf; hi me rnnrg<* on wuioli
Mrs. Truniper was arrested. she returned
to the orphanage and whisked
the baby away in an automobile. She
was overtaken by police.
In court appeared the other woman.
Mrs. Wahlquist says she is the child's
real mother and that she left the little
girl at the orphanage because she
was too poor to care for her.
The only evidence in her favor is
I tho name under which the child was
registered at the orphanage.
She says she can't bear to have her
child known as the babv of another!
woman.
To complicate affairs for the 1:1 jury- j
men who will have to decide which j
woman is the child's mother, the ba-j
by looks like both of them.
All are blondes, although Mrs. Truro- j
per's hair is lighter. All have blue !

If Mrs. Tntmper is acquitted she j
will get the baby, h found guilty I
of kidnaping she will not only lose;
the child, but may he sent' to the per.-1
