Teiper was brought Into court for trial
here today. At her home, his sister
urace. wno is expectea to oe me cniei
witness in the trial, lay under the care
of a physician, her mind said still to
be a blank as to events immediately
preceding the assault which it is
charged Teiper made upon her at the
same time and place their mother met
death. It is understood that both de
fence and prosecution are agreed that
it would be necessary to make Miss
Telpers evidence by deposition at
home.
It is said that the defence expects
her evidence to support Telper's claim
that the crimes were committed by an
unknown man. supposedly a negro, who
attacked his mother, sister and- broth
er. Frederic, to rob them as their auto
mobile stood in the roadway near here
The brother also met death and Teiper
is charged with his murder as well as
with assault with intent to kill his
sister. It is only for the murder of the
mother he was placed on trial today.
