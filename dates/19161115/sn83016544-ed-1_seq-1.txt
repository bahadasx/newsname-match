THE COOK NEWS
COLDEST WEATHER EVER
RECORDED IN NOVEMBER
26 Below Zero at Sheridan Wyomirig,
Close to Zero Around Grand Ma
rais and Vioinity.
A cold wave with temperatre at
various places lower than ever be­
fore recorded in November, over­
spreads the region west of the Mis­
sissippi river and will move east­
ward to the Atlantic coast. Sheri­
dan, Wyo., reported the lowest tem­
perature, with 26 deg. below zero
Lander, Wyo., 24 deg. below zero,
and Cheyenne, Wyo., Yellowstone Na­
tional park, and Harve, Mont. 20 deg.
below.
Six above was the coldest report­
ed in Grand Marais, but higher up
on the hill it was considerable colder
The intense cold reaches south­
ward into the interior of Texas.
Weather bureau officials said the
cold wave would perhaps diminish
in intensity as it moved eastward.
Its movement and intensity were
somewhat dependent, they pionted
out, on the West Indian disturbance
which was reported in the Caribbean
sea in the vicinity of Swan islands.
That storm apparently was increas­
ing in intensity and will move north­
ward probably attended by strong
winds reaching gale force during the
next thirty-six hours over the east
portion of the Gulf of Mexico and
South Florida.

HE DOVE RIGHT IN
When boys began fooling with a
boat, the door of "Davy Jone's lock­
er" swings wide open. If any of
them go home alive, it's luck.
It was the same old story last A
pril, in Norfolk, Va. Three boys
jumped into a boat, another set
them adrift. A ten-year-old tried
to heave a rope to a friend on shore
and went over the side with the line.
Couldn't swim. The rest of the
trio scared stiff. Just about time
for the grappling hooks, when a fel­
low came along who knew what to
do.
He was a scout—Cecil Lowenberg,
of Trop 4 weight 104 pounds, all
sand no fuss or false motions—just
dove in, snaked the kid over to a
boat which was hitched to the shore
and held him till a man pulled them
out.
The scout says that he, himself,
was in no danger. The National
Court of Honor had to agree with
him, but a bungler might have lost
his life. An honor medal, earned by
taking risks, is a decoration to be
proud of, but a letter of commenda­
tion, such as Scout Lowenberg re­
ceived is. just as honorable when it
means that, by good judgment, the
rescue has been made without dan­
ger to the rescuer.—Boys' Life.
NOTICE!

CLAUS C. MONKER,
Dated Nov. 15, 1916. Sec.
A sportsman from the Twin Ci­
ties camped north of Elbow lake
heard a noise outside the tent yes­
terday morning and getting up to
investigate he saw a fine moose
looking at him which he immediately
bagged. His party was taken out
and located by Sam Zimmerman, Jr.
Moral: For the best livery service

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, getii pass book today and de­
posit your money vitfih

GO MAN LOST IN
WOODS NEAR ELY
Jackson, Grain Dealer, Has
Been Missing Since Last
Friday.
Horace Jackson, age 63, wealthy
member of the Chicage Board of
Trade, and well known among Du­
luth grainmen because of his annual
excursions to northern Minnesota,
has been lost since last Friday in the
woods north of Ely.
Despite the organization and ef-"
forts of a number of searching par­
ties, composed of only experienced
woodsmen, no trace of him has been
found. On Saturday one searching
party discovered a place where it
was thought that Jackson might
have camped Friday night, but this
was simply a conjecture. It is the
only clue, however, thus far picked
up.
Friends fear that he may possibly
have been hurt by an accidental dis
charge of his own gun or injured in
some other manner. They discount
the theory that he may have been
lost, for, while he has never before
hunted for game in the woods north
of Ely, he is an experienced hunter
and little fear is entertained that he
would be unable to find his way.
The first searching party went out
Friday night, after Jackson had fail­
ed to return to camp for supper.
Since then the searchers have been
reinforced every day. Sunday and
yesterday squads sent out were e
quipped with enough provisions to
permit them to continue the search
indefinitely. This will make it un­
necessary to loose valuable time by
returning to Ely every day for pro­
visions. Friends will offer a sub­
stantial reward for the finding of
the missing man.
Harry Hummitch, of Hovland, ar­
rived in the village this morning.
Ingvar Larson, of Hovland, has
purchased T. G. Sandeno's Ford car.
Mons Hanson, of Hovland, arrived
in the village this morning for a
short business stay.
Wheat has passed the $2.00 mark
and we may soon expect flour to
make another ascension.
Good dry wood delivered to your
house for $2.25 a cord. Leave your
order at Schoen's store.—Ever John­
son, Colvill.
County Auditor Carter left for
the big game fields "somewhere in
Cook County" on Sunday morning
and will not return until he bags
the biggest and best moose at
large.
Hunting moose and deer seems to
be more popular than ever judging
by the number of hunters who have
gone out from this village this year.
The importance of keeping the
roads well dragged just before
freezing up has been demonstrated
in Cook County the past two weeks.
The roads that were well dragged
are now as smooth as pavements
and will remain so until spring
while the roads that were not kept
in condition are very rough and will
so remain. Very few parts of the
North Shore boulevard were not
dragged b,ut those that were un
dragged are very noticeable.
