U-BOAT IS REPORTED OFF NEW ENGLAND
START RECALL ON MAYOR GILL
- A QUESTION THAT I
NEEDS THOUGHT
BY THE EDITOR
Citizens who advocated the construction of the city light plant
have lived now to see their most optimistic predictions fulfilled.
For two or three years the plant has been giving Tacomans tlie
best illuminating service at a reduced cost, and at the same time pil
ing up a profit which not only pays the interest on the bonds but
which will, at no distant date, retire the issue.
Now Tacoma's big sister Seattle is seeking to buy from us 5000
killowatts of current on a throe-year contract, an amount which, at I
reasonable rate, would bring in at least $400 a day revenue. So anxious
is Seattle to obtain this currant that it agrees even to build its own
transmission line to our substation.
This offer raises a question that should not be decided offhand by
the commissioners.
Four hundred dollars a day will be pure "velvet" for the city un
der existing conditions, because it -will not cost a cent additional to
supply the extra current.
The sum would assist very materially in paying off the indebted
ness and hastening the day when light rates can be cut far lower. That
is what Tacomans want to see.
On the other hand, as Commissioner Oronen points out, Tacoma is
certain to meet an increased home demand for its electricity. New
nianufacurinig plants are coining. Other great enterprises, news of
which has not yet been made public, are soon to materialize. New
uses are being found every day for electricity. Tacoma does not want
to be tied up with a three-year contract if it will prove a hampering
bond before the 36th month expires.
But, if the city can handle the contract it ought to. The commis
sioners must give their best thought to determining if it can.
In either case Tacoma's high faith in its electric plant is vindicat
ed. The Nisqually enterprise is one of our most magnificent city as
sets.

Mayor Calls On Housewives
to Join In Bread Trust Fight
Representatives of the
bakery trust ln Tacoma are
beginning to sqoirm under
Mayor Fawcett's threat to
open n municipal bread coun
ter at the city hall. In retali
ation for this week's increase
in prices,
"The vice president of the bak
ers' association called me up by
'phone today and wanted to know
what I meant by my threat," de
clared Fawcett Wednesday.
"I told him that I had evl
ence that the bread trust was
Blmply trying to gouge the people
of Tacoma under a plea that the
high cost of materials was forcing
Increased prices for bread.
"And I told him that I was go
ing to smash him and the rest of
the bakers Who are behind the
move, unless they treat the pub
lic fairly.
Advises a Boycott.
"He asked me why I didn't at
tend to my own affairs, and keep
out of other people's business,
and I replied that I considered it
one of the most important matters
I could attend to as mayor of
Tacoma."
Mayor Fawcett continued his
fight for a boycott of the Tacoma
bakers Wednesday by asking all
Tacoma housewives to go on rec
ord for home-made bread.
A coupon Is printed in The
Times today, which the women
ire asked to sign.
"But I probably won't have to
jell the bread at the city hall,"
3ald Fawcett.
Grocers With Mayor.
"A dozen different grocers
have already notified me that
they would he glad to handle mu
nicipal bread, and sell It at cost.
They will even come to the city
hall and get it. The grocrs are
as much opposed to the bread
trust's high prices as are the pub
lic."
A meeting of the master bakers
of Tacoma Is scheduled for Wed
nesday evening to discuss Faw
cett's proposed boycott.
It is reported that the bakers
-will claim that they are forced to
Increase their prices because of
the Increase in flour.
"But that Is not true," said
Fnwcett. "1 can prove that the
bakers are not paying any more
wages to their employes today
than they did a year ago. Th*
Believing that bread prices in Tacoma have been advanced
to an exorbitant figure, I hereby agree to bake my own bread
until such time as the bakers decide to treat housewives fairly.
I approve Mayor Fawlett's attack on the bread trust.

The animal was run over and
when Gilson left the car to see if
it had been damaged the coyote

HKATTI.K, Nov. 15.—A
ret-all movement :i-_.»in-t
.Mayor Hi rum C. -11111 Is prac
tically under way to<lay.
That such action waa about lo
be started had been rumored ior
several day..
It materialized yesterduy to tha
extent that a "law and order"
meeting was railed at the Press
club theater and resolutions pro
pared hy Jay Thomas, brewery
press agent; James A. Wood, pub
licity agent, and Judge ThoiniH
Hurke, former railway attorney,
, condemning the mayor, wire pass
ed.
J. K. Whiter*.iioon, who acted
| as secretary of the meeting, urged
i that '*th-M»eeting should do just
I what It was called together to do,
namely, condemn Mayor Gill by
organizing a campaign to recall
him."
I. W. W. Action Blamed.
Others, including W. 0. Dawson
and C. J. Smith, leading empl_y
ers here, urged the same action
after Judge Burke had dollevere.l
a fiery speech.
The resolution*, recited Ihe
Everett fight Nov. 5, and suld the
I. W. W.s assembled at head
qarters in Seattle, armed them
selves ln Seattle and marched to
tho city docks "in military fash
ion." *
These things were known by
i the Seattle police, the resolution
stated, and it was resolved that
"We unqualifiedly condemn May
or H. C. Gill for his failure (o
enforce the laws and ordinances
which were openly violated by the
I. W. W.s in their preparations
for the Invasion of Everett,' 'and
for the failure to prevent them
from "setting forth on their un
lawful and murderous mission.*'
Pastor In Chairman.
Rev. W. A. Major was chairman
of the meeting.
Erastus Drainerd, formerly edi
tor of the Seattle P.-1., i-.rged that
the resolution be supplemented
with an invitation to Mayor Mer
rill of Everett and Mayor Gill to
appear at a future date and give
their versions of the cause of the
Everett situation.
Several citizens wanted to know
whether the resolution recited
actual facts, and especially If the
I. W. W.s were openly armed
here before going to Everett.
C. J. Smith, capitalist, answer
ed that the facts in the resolu
tion were correct, but whether or
not the men were openly armed,
they "marched to the boat in mili
tary formation."
Recalled Once Before.
Gill is the same mayor who was
recalled about five years ago after
a grand jury Investigation of red
light conditions. At that time his
chief of police, Wappenstein, went
to the penitentiary.
Two years ago he was trium
phantly elected for a new term,
and this year re-elected, both
times as a reform candidate.
May Be Wet Move.
While ostensibly the I. W. W.
matter is the reason for the re
call movement, It Is pointed out
by Mayor Gill's friends that the
"wet" forces are behind the agi
tation.
During his present term he has
been an uncompromising "dry"
and has been very active in clos
ing up bootlegging establishments
of all sorts.

Few of them realized how much

PROPOSES 30-MILE
CASCADE TUNNEL
Noted Engineer Would Have
State Aid In Big Traffic
Efficiency Enterprise
The longest railway tunnel in tho world, almost
three times as long as any now in existence, ami as
loii|r as the proposed tunnel under the Knglish chan
nel, will cany practically all passenger and freight
traffic on present and future railway lines under the
great wall of the Cascades to l*ugot sound, if tho pro
ject outlined by (Jen. Hiram M. Chittenden in today's
number of "Engineering News" should become a
reality.
The famous Simplon tunnel, in the Alps, it
12.25 miles long.
Gen. Chittenden's proposed tunnel under the
Cascades would be 30 miles long! jf~
Gen. Chittenden is chairman of the Seattle port!
commission, and before his retirement was one of tho
best known officers in the V. S. engineer corps.
So seriously is his project taken that Engineering
News gives it a long editorial notice in the same issue
of the maua/ine.
In spite of the Stampede. ( as
eade and Snoqualmie tunnels |
which pierce the thin comb of the
range, the Cascades have always,
stood like a storm-defended wall
around the Puget Sound country.
Kail traffic has sometimes been
entirely stopped for periods of
from one to three weeks during,
tho winter, while avalanches anil |
landslides have taken heavy toll in
life and money. I
Oen. Cliitlenden'B proposed,
tunnel would eliminate from 1300
to 1800 feet of the present vertl-i
'cal climb of half a mile with its,
'attendant cost In money, life andi
Iruaalng-tlme! reduce the maxt-|
mum grade from 2.2 per cent tol
O.G per cent, eliminate curvature
amounting to l„MI degrees, and
cut down the time of passenger
trains, lie claims, from 3 hours to
40 minutes, and of freight trains
from 10 hours to an hour and a
half.
"Tho technical problem presents
nothing which should seriously
challenge the resources of the en
gineering profession," says Gen.
Chittenden in his article.
The tunnel would cost, Includ
ing interest, il built with no shafts
In Its entire length, uliout AMI,
--(KIO.OIIO. ami would take IS years
to complete.
Each shaft sunk would increase
the first cost, but reduce the in
terest by more than the same
amount by shortening construction
time. The cost, if built with four
shafts, he estimates, would bo
about $43,000,000, and the time
to complete about 5 ._ years.
The project, he admits, probably
would be opposed at least by the
No-th Bank road, from Spokane
to Portland, into whose business it
would cut badly, and possibly by
some of the Puget Sound roads
who would hesitate to give up part
of their heavy Investments ln
their separate lines, ln order to
co-operate ln the new scheme.
He believes, however, that while
the advantages would be greater
to some of the roads than to oth
ers, annual savings would amount
ln some cases to hundreds of
thousands of dollars, and lv others
to millions.
"The new route," he says,
"would be available for every
eastern line which now reaches
Puget Sound or evar will."
Gen. Chittenden believes the
project, while worthy of federal
aid, will never be able to get It,
because "the precedent would be
too far-reaching;" though he
points out that "the government
outlay on the Improvement of the
Columbia river above Portland ag
gregates $11,000,000, or nearly
one-third the cost <_T the tunnel;
yet it is doubtful If the river will
ever carry 10 per cent of the traf
fic that would pass through the
tunnel."
State aid, however, he thinks
It should have.
"All that New York harbor has
meant to the state of New York.
Puget Sound should mean to the
state of Washington; md all that
the Erie canal meant to the slates
bordering on the Oreat Lakes, this
low-grade route should mean to
the Northwest," he says; an J
calls attention to the fact that
{when New York had a population
|or about a million, It paid $7,
--! GOO,OOO toward the building ot
the Erie canal.
