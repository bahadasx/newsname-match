o'clock to decide definitely upon the
awarding of the contract
James T. Taylor, special engitteer
on the project since it -first sprang into
existence and now a bidder for the
contract, and J. C. Pincanco of Picanco
& Gomes, spoke feelingly on opposite
sides of the question.
Taylor's remarks were strengthened
by a formal protest which he had filed
with the commission, while .Picanco's
speech was long and rambling, often
filled with broken Kiiglish that was
difficult to understand. "
If Picanco is thrown out as a bid
der, however, it must be because of a
decision by . the board that he is in
competent to carry out his offer. The
attorney general ha ruled that the
slight mistake that he mad in filing his
bid cannot be considered enough to
bar him. He was Instructed today

"1. That said bid irregular and

"2. " That said Picanco & Gomes are
not 'responsible bidders' as required
by law, in that (a) they do not pos

capacity required to perform the con
tract according to its tjerms; (b) that
they did in 1906 secure contract for
the construction of Iao valley road at
Wailuku, Maui, which they failed to
complete, forcing the completion of
the . work -upon their bondsmen at a
substantial unrepatd loss; (c) that the

Green-, and his partner one C. O. Hot

which Picanco had not finished, and
that the latter had refused --to, 'assist
in any matter." I
Picanca'teelared that he was at the
time a partner of Green, and said to-1

to finish up the work when he Him-

4000 miles of ocean and the Marconi

opened up. The service was begun at
4:20 a. m. here which corresponds
with midnight in Japan.
The initial messages sent" consisted
of . congratulatory marconlgraros from
Governor Pinkham, Mayor- Lane', the
chambar of commerce and other prom

Among the first messages sent were
