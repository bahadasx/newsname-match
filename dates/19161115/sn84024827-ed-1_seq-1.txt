(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14. Champ
Clark. Speaker of the House, reached
Washington today and conferred with
Democratic leaders regarding the con
gressional election, which, according
to the latest unofficial returns, leaves
control of the next house In doubt
The speaker first conferred with Rep
resentative Doremus of Michigan
chairman of the Democratic congres
sional committee who predicted, de
spite unofficial returns Indicating the
election of five more Republicans than
Democrats, that the final canvas will
give the Democrats control and the
speaker would be re-elected.
On the other hand Representative
Woods of Iowa, chairman of the Re
publican congressional committee,
was insisting that complete returns
would show Republican gains instead
of losses and that Republicans would
dictate- the' organization of the house.
Doremus Confident
Representative Doremus, in his
statement of doubtful districts at the
informal conference of party leaders,
claimed that official returns would
reverse the result and show the elee
tion of W. O. Martin, Democrat, over
W. P. Martin, Progressive-Protectionist,
in Louisiana; ebulon Weaver.
Democrat, over James J. Britt, Repub
lican, In North Carolina; Thomas
Scully, Democrat, over Robert Car

R. Bacon. Republican, in Michigan
T. J. Steele, Democrat, over G. C
Scott. Republican, in Iowa, and M. C
Kelly, Progressive over Wm. H. Cole
man. Republican in Pennsylvania.
In addition, Mr. Doremus insisted
that Clyde E. Tavenner, 14th Illinois
Harry B. Mitchell, Montana at large
and Thomas G. Patton. eighteenth
New York, all apparently defeated by
Republicans, had excellent chances o'f
ultimate success. He asserted that
despite the election of Miss JeanettP
Rankin, Republican, in Montana, by a
majority of 400, that Harry B. Mitch
ell had won by a majority of 10.000
This information, he said, had come
from several sources.
Contest in Maryland
Republican leaders are claiming
that final results will show the elec.
tion of A. J. Barchfeld, Republican
over Guy E. Campbell, Democrat, in
the 32nd Pennsylvania, and Robert F
Dure, Republican, over Jesse D. Price
Democrat, in the first district of Mary
land. Announcement of a contest Ir
the Maryland district was made today
In the 32nd Pennsylvania district or
the official count today, Campbell
Democrat, had made a net gain of 14
votes in two Pittsburg wards.
Speaker Clark evinced great inter
est In the claims of the Democratic
congressional committee and remark
ed at the close of the conference that
the "situation was very interesting."
Watch Count, Says Clark
"The only thrne to be done," the
speaker said, "is to watch the official
count in all the districts and wait fo
the final results. Three times In the
history of the government there have
been prolonged contests over the elec

ATLANTIC CITY. Nov. 14.
Repudiation by Luis Cabrera to
day of a plan of border control
that had been agreed upon by two
of his colleagues and the three
American members again lias
made doubtful the ability of the
Americans on the American- Mexi
can joint commission to assist
Mexico in its efforts to restore
normal conditions along the fron
tier. The Americans were hope
ful tonight that they might in
duce the Mexicans to agree to
what they believe to be a satisfac
tory plan for the protection of life
and property along the border, but
it was indicated by those in touch
with them that further opposition,
characterized as quibbling, would
not long be tolerated.
Conference May End.
There appeared reason to be
lieve that unless the chairman ot
the Mexican commission adopted
a more tractable manner, he and
his associates would be informed
that further consideration of Mex
ican problems would come to an
end.

for the withdrawal of the Ameri

That the agreement on the part

quarters indicated that an early

Officers pointed out that the

Firing Line, Is Report,
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14. Deporta
tion of Belgian civilians into Germa
ny for forced labor has reached such
serious proportions that American
Charge Drew, at Berlin, has been di
rected by the State Department to
take the matter up personally with
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg.
The charge was requested to say
that such deportations could not but
have a most unfortunate, effect on neu,
tral opinion, particularly in the Unit
ed States, which has the welfare of
the Belgian civilian population very
much at heart.
The instructions, it was learned to
day, grew out of a long report from
Charge Grew in which he stated that
he had dfscusscd the situation infor
mally and unofficially with Under
Secretary of Foreign Affairs Zimmer
man. The latter admitted that a defii
nite policy had been adopted to en
force the labor of Belgians in cases
where they would not work voluntari
ly on the ground that so many refused
to work as to make the strain on pub
lic charity intolerable.
Pledges Are ViJated
The deportations are viewed here
not only as violation of international
'aw but in a degree as a violation of
Germany's assurances to Ambassador
Gerard last June, which though relat
ing to the 20,000 French women and
eirls deported from Lille, Roubaix and
Tourcoing, are felt to be applicable
to the Belgium situation. At that
time, when Ambassador Gerard had
gone to general headquarters in
France to discuss the attack on the
Sussex with Emperor William, all the
American relief headquarters In north
ern France were called into confer
ence and assurance given by the Ger
mans that no further deportations
would be made.
Reports from Rome that the United
States has Joined or will join the Vat
ican, Spain and the Netherlands in a
Joint protest is declared to be untrue.
Public Appeal Made
The deportations are regarded by
some officials here as an attempt to
-elease German workers for the firing
line by replacing them with Belgians.
More than any other one thing this is
expected to increase the bitterness of
the allies toward Germany and their
desire for peace through a crushing
victory. Foreign Minister Beyens and
Cardinal Mercier of Belgium have is
sued public appeals to the neutral na
Mons to effect a cessation of deporta
tions. England also Is deeply con
"rned. Reports as to the execution of the
'eportatons vary in detail but not In
Principle. Those who go to Germany

ed good food, a salary, guarantee of

INTERNATIONAL LAW
QUESTIONS ANSWERED
Reply Dictated by Viscount
Grey Arouses Much Interest
in Washington; Americans
Misinformed, Is Contention.
(By Review Leased Wire) ,
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14. The Bri
tish reply to the latest American note
protesting against the trade blacklist
made public tonight by the state de
partment, denies that rights ot neutral
traders under international law have
been ruthlessly cancelled, defines the
blacklist measure as a municipal reg
ulation plainly concerning the British
government and British citizens, and
contends that it is designed to shorten
the war.
The note fails to meet the American
demand that the names of American
firms be stricken fitm the blacklist,
but attempts to convince the state de
partment that the British position Is
just and founded on law. It leaves
open the door for further negotiation,
which is expected to follow.
Peace la Discussed.
The note was subscribed by Viscount
Grey, the British foreign minister, and
was addressed K and transmitted by
Walter Hines Page, the American am
bassador at London.
A part which attracted much official
notice dealt with the subject of peace,
based on the theory that one Ameri
can contention bad been that there
exists no military necessity for the
blacklist, that it is unnecessary for
the allies to prejudice neutral cotn
iierce. and that nothing which hap
pens in distant neutral countries can
influence the result bf the great con
flict. Britain's Position Upheld.
"If that really were the position."
says the note, "it is possible that the
measures by His Majesty's govern
ment might be described as uncalled
for, but it is not We may well wish
that it were so. Even though the
military situation of the allies has
been greatly improved, there is still a
long, bitter struggle in front of them
?nd which in justice to the principles
'or which they are fighting imposes
ipon them the duty ot employing every
-neasure which they can legitimately
lse to overcome their opponents.
"Whatever Inconvenience may be
-aused to neutral nations by the ex
orcise of belligerent rights, it la not
to be compared for an Instant to the
suffering and loss occasioned to man
kind by the prolongation ot the war
even for a week."
Germany Assailed.'
In its argument the note points out
'hat German business houses through
out the world have further advanced
the interests of Germany in the war
ind have been active in commercial
aid to that country.
"Such operations have been carried
out in the territory even ot the United
States itself and I am bound to ob
serve, what I do not think will be de
nied, that no adequate action yet has
Seen taken by the government of the
United States to suppress breaches ot
neutrality of that particular commer
cial kind."
The note is based largely on the
argument that there is no assumption
by Great Britain of power to inter
fere with neutral traders but that the
blacklist is a matter of municipal law
enjoining British subjects from trad
ing with persons found to be assist
!ng or rendering service to the enemy.
It disclaims any intention of imposing
tisabilities 'or penalties on neutral
trade.
Says U. S. Mii"ormed.
"I can scarcely believe," it i -
"that the United States government
'ntends to challenge the right of Great
Pritain as a sovereign state to pass
legislation prohibiting all those who
