BRITISH DRIVE ON, BERLIN ADMITS
LOOK TO WILSON AS MEDIATOR TO END WAR
PEACE FOR EUROPE ON WAY,
SAYS APPONYI, WHO SEES
WILSON AS THE MEDIATOR:
Hungarian Leader Says Presi
dent May See Mis Opportun
ity to I:iut Great War.
TIME IS DRAWING NEAR.
Declares Teutons Want to Be
Friendly With America, as
It Js Greatest Neutral.
By Carl W. Ackermnn.
H12IU.1N, .Nov. tl (via riayvlllc
wireless, Nov. 15). Campaign wor
lies off his mind, his election as
sured, President Wilson "may prove
an altogether different President and
sec his opportunity, when tho mo-
mciit arrives, to licit) olitnln peace In ,
Klirope." I
Ho declared Count Apponyl, one of!
the most prominent of Hungarian
trad am nml n world flmire lieforo the
war In the peace by arbitration move
ment, on his arrival here to-day from
Hudapost to speak at a special meet
ing of the Ilelchatng. Ho declared
jicnce vtna "getting nearer."
"I'm sure It's on Its way." he said.
And hn added with a happy smile.:
"t don't mean peace will come, next
week, or next month or within two
months, even. I am only certain that
the foundations for peace aro now
being laid.
'If you will compare the speeches of
Chancellor lietbmann-Hollweg and
lord drey, made at tho beginning of
the war, with what they havo said
recently, you will seo that tho two
chief belligerents aro getting on
closer ground. They are mill wldo
npart-but they aro approaching a
common ground."
Count Apponyl paused, and de
manded: "Hut tell mc, who was elected Presi
dent of tho United States?"
Tho Interviewer said latest reports
Indicated Wilson.
"I hope It Is Wilson," Count Ap
ponyi responded. "Wo know Wilson.
1 mlgltt say wo could be no worso off
with him but wo know nothing about
Hughes."
"Do you think Wilson could do
Bomethlng now to help bring bellig
erents together?" was nsked.
"I think If Wilson Is elected and
he no longer hus the worries of tho
campaign ho may prove an altogether
illffeient President," tho Count re
plied. "I think he will see tho oppor
tunity when tho moment arrives.
America la psychologically tho lead
ing neutral nation. America still
might play the leading rolo In peace."
Count Apponyl Is well acquainted
with American life and customs. It
was In recalling his visits there that
the count added
"I am so glad to see mat we aru
sending a new Ambassador to Amor-
rC" ,.. 1,n,l nn s.mnorL

It Is difficult for Ameilca to under-

'fter nil wo want peace with
Ameilca wo want to bo menu y. we
a cognUe America, as the great-
est neutral nation, play nn Im
iiorlanl part whr ' ! International
pence which endi war Is made."
Hevertlng to Pr ient Wilson's op.
poitunlty to play a rolo In peace pro-
cecdlngs, It was apparent from Count
Apponyl's expressions that he did not
bcllove tho President should move at
once.
"The psychological momont," he
paid, "ho t'nt yet utrlvcrt. tlnunninl1

Johnstown and (Jloversvlllo Itallroad,

Iltoodhoiiiids that were called into

availed but llttlo on account of the
snow storm which started last night
and fell steadily, leaving about ten
Inches on the ground. The snowfall
was resumed this uflcrnoon and any
possibility of picking up Hankcr's
trail is now Impossible.
Mr. Hanker knew tho region very
well and undoubtedly ho would have
extricated himself from any dllllciilty
lu finding his way out of the woods
If be had not met with nil accident.
The nikrgistiou Is made that he may
have been the victim of some foolish
huntsman mistaking him for a doer,
or that he may have been caught In

The search will lie kept up to-night,
