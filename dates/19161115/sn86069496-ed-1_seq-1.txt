COLUMBIA, ADAIR COUNTY, KENTUCKY, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 15. 1916.
VOLUME XX
NUMBER 3
"WHEN MALINDA SINGS."
The latest figures in the National
election show that Mr. Wilson carried
twenty-eight States for certain, giving
him 269 votes in the electoral college,
three more than is necessary. To the
269 votes you can add New Hampshire
4 -votes and New Mexico 3, which will
give him 276 votes, 266 elects. Minne
sota and West Virginia, with 20
votes, in all probability have been car
ried by Mr. Hughes which will make
his vote in the electoral college 255.
If he had carried New Hampshire and
New Mexico he would have then been
short 4 votes, so the reader can see
that Mr Wilson's election is beyond
question.
Mr. Wilson's majority of the pop
ular vote is considerably over four
hundred thousand.
On Tuesday night, when the re
turns commenced to come in, the re
ports were very favorable for Mr.
Hughes, and the Democrats felt blue
and manj were of the opinion that
Mr. Wilson had lost the election, but
a message went over the wires from
Vance McCormick, Chairman of the
National Democratic Committee, say
ing that if Ohio is carried by the
President he will be elected; that the
West would do the rest, and it turned
out as he predicted. Ohio went Dem
ocratic by something like eighty
thousand, and the West dropped in a
sufficiency to make the 269 votes.
There is one gratifying thing this
election shows, and that is that a
Democratic President can be elected
without New York, Indiana and Illi
nois. Before the election the Republicans
were claiming that Mr. Hughes would
get the German vote solidly, but he
failed in that as many of them sup
ported the Democratic candidate, and
to-day all Europe is glad that Mr.
Wilson has been re-elected.
When you take into cbnsideration
that there were in the United States
something like a million and a half
more Republicans than there were
Democrats, the President run the
most remarkable race ever pulled off
in the history of the country. While
Wall Street was doing what it could
to advance Mr. Hughes' interest, the
common people throughout the coun
try were laying plans to elect Mr. Wil
son, and so they did, and the country
has now settled down to business.
The Upper House of Congress will
have a Democratic majority of ten or
twelve, but the lower House is close,
the Republicans having a majority of
one or two. There are six independ
ent Representatives and it is believed
that five of them will act with the
Democrats, but in our judgment it is
uncertain as to how they will vote.
This information will come out in the
election of the speaker of the House
Kentucky that the Republicans
made a desperate effort to carry went
a little over 27,000 for the Democratic
ticket.
All the ten Democratic Congress
men in this State were re-elected.
Mr. Helm's majority over Mr. L. T.
Neat is something over three thou
sand. The Democrats throughout the
United States are rejoicing because
they have a right to shout when they
feel good.
Tjhe emblem of olr party is a game
rooster. Our large ones are away
from the office crowing with their
neighbors The little fellow at the
head of this column, is making all the
noise he can, and is happy in "sending
the news to Mary."
NOTBS.
Senator Kern, who was defeated for
United States Senator in Indiana,
may go into the cabinet.
Democratic parades were participat
ed in all over the country last Friday
and Saturday nights.
The Democratic boys of Columbia
celebrated by firing anvils.
The yell for the Western boys foot
ball team is: "Hi Rah Hoo, Hi Rah
ITee. Wilson. Wilson, one. r.wn f.hrep '
The Republicans felt sure they
would defeat Bob Thomas in the
Third, but they were doomed to dis
appointment. No break in the solid South, and
Missouri and Kansas showed up on the
right side.

Sold Fine Stallion.
Mr. C. D. Hagan, of Parksville, sold
to Mr. R. H. Price, of Columbia, Ky.,
his great breeding stallion, "Red Pea
vine." Red Peavine is one of the rich
est bred stallions in Kentucky and
has made a great record, producing a
number of good ones, At a recent
saddle horse sale, held in Springfield,
Ky., a filly colt sired by Red Peavine,
was bought by Miss Craft, of Boston,
Mass., for 8450; only one in the sale
brought a higher price, this was a six
year-old mare. Not only is Mr. Price,
but stockmen of Adair county, are in
deed fortunate in securing this great
horse. By breeding their mares to
Red Peavine, they will secure the
very highest class colts, colts that
will grow into good money. Mr.
Price who bought the horse is known
to many residents of the county. It
was at Parksville he secured one of
the best young women in Kentucky
for a wife. Danville Messenger.

New Epoch in Political Life.
London, Nov. 11. The Manchester
Guardian attributes President Wil
son's success to the rallying of a suf
ficient number of the Progressive
votes which Roosevelt gained in 1912
"It seems a small thing," this news
paper continues, "but yet it may in
dicate a new epoch in American po
litical life. The Progressive move
ment arose entirely independently for
foreign politics.
"Many Progressive votes given to
Wilson are given with the mental res
ervation that they will not go again
to a Democratic candidate unless Wil
son confirms the faith of the Pro
gressives by consolidating what is
still only tentative. If he does that
he will have established himself as
the ablest statesman since Lincoln,
and he may be destined to play a part
in the achievement of peace which
will give him a placelin world history.
