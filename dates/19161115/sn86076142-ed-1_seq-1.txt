Count Apponyi Says That the United
States May be the Means
of Suggesting Terms
iBr iHMlnrH fmi.)
BERLIN, Nov. 13 (Delayed in transmission). The opening of
peace negotiations may'perhaps be expected with fair prospect of
success during the course of the coming winter, according to Count
Albert Apponyi, the veteran Hungarian leader and former Hun
garian premier.
Apponyi, who is visiting Germany to deliver addresses on
Hungarian history, expressed his views in an interview given the
Associated l'ress, wherein he discussed the general European
situation.
Count Apponyi was asked if he thought the start of peace
discussion should come from within the camps of the warring
powers or whether the outside impetus in the form of a tender of
the good offices of a neutral power would be necessary. He replied
he saw no reason why neutral mediation should not be welcomed
when the opportune moment to which he referred should arrive,
and added he knew no reason why President Wilsou should not be
acceptable as an intermediary.

(Br AuwUIrd Fnu)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. Attorney
General Gregory has decided that
su;u against enforcement of the
Adamson law will be defended by
the department of justice. Tbe de
fense presented In each case will be
worked out between Solicitor General
Davis and other department officials
with United States attorneys of tbe
various jurisdictions.
The department is unable to de
termine whether it will be necessary
to defend each of the many auits
already begun or whether the rail
roads will be content to make a test
case in one suit. No word has
reached the attorney general from
tbe railroads suggesting such a
course. If such proposal is not made
each suit will be defended.
Departmental officials in charge of
the defense stated that no offers had
been made by the attorney general
about making a tent case of any par
ticular suit. They pointed out that
the granting or refusing of a tem
porary restraining order by one fed
eral judge would not be binding on
another federal judge of equal rank
and that its force would only be
argumentative.

SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 15. As to
whether the' highest vote for a Re

greater than' the lowest vote for a
Democratic elector, Js about the only
question of interest to California poli
ticians, ir tht should prove to be
tha casa, tha state's delegation in the
electoral college; may be split. The
Republican aBmittedly unearthed
nothing in tha course of the day for
or against such a prospect.
Sidney M. Van Wyck, Jr., chair
man of the . Democratic state cam
paign commlHee, woraed all ' day
bringing in reports from all counties
in the mountains, where tha county
clerks had finished their counts and
also succeeded1'' in getting one or
two fair sized ; counties. Hia total
for 20 counties showed that tbe totals
for' the lowest Democratic elector in
each county added 6466, or more than
the totals for the highest Republican
elector In tbe same counties. This
count would ahow, whan completed,
the Wilson electoral vote at its low
est ebb, Mr. Van Wyck said. That
is to say, if the lowest -Democratic
totals are finally ahead of the highest
Republican totals, a solid delegation
in the electoral college is assured.
If the highest Republican totals ex
ceed the lowest Democratic totals
this will not necessarily indicate that
any Republican electors " win, be
cause the lowest Democrat and the
highest Republican are not the same
in all counties.
Republicans and Democrats alike
manifest surprise at rumors, trace
able in all cases to the east, that a
considerable error "had been found
somewhere In the state in counting
the votes.
"The mistake as ' reported would
have to be In San Francisco, Alameda
and Los Angeles counties," said Mr.
Van Wyck. "It is in none of them,
and, so far as we have been able to
learn, it does not exist. The final
count will show no material change.
Reports from Republican headquar

approach It nor attempt to escape,

All on board the Columbian put on
life belts. Tha captain prepared to
aand bis first officer by boat to the
submarine with documents and a de
mand that the American flag be re
spected, but tha sea was too high
and the trip too basardous. The
Columbian followed tbe submarine
throughout the night, being guided by
rockets, which also were sent up
from time to time by tbe Columbian.
Toward o'clock in tbe morning,
six American seamen manned a boat
and went with a petty officer to the
submarine with the object of ex
plaining that it was an American
ship. They were not allowed to

Nothing at headquarters indicated
that an early withdrawal of General

WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. With the
submission to the supreme court of
three so-called "white slave" cases,
the question of future federal prose
cutions for violations of the Mann
law, when elements of commercial
ized vice or coercion are absent, now
awaits the court's decision.
In arguing appeals from conviction
under the Mann act of F. Drew
Camlnetti and Maury I. Digga of
Sacramento, Cal., and L. I. Hays of
Alva, Okla., Assistant Attorney Gen-
erty Wallace, for the government,
asked the court to interpret the law
so as to prohibit interstate transpor
tation of women for any Immoral pur
pose, including non-commercial, per
sonal immoral escapades. Tbe con
tention that congress never intended
the law to apply to cases of mere
Immorality, without the elements of
commercial traffic or coercion, was
presented by former Senator Bailey
of Texas and Harry O. Glasser of
Enid, Okla!, for the defendants.
Final decision of the highest court
to set at rest variant rulings oi
federal courts was asked in the
arguments. It Is possible that Diggs'
case may be reopened later this week
to hear his personal counsel, who was
not able to reach Washington.
