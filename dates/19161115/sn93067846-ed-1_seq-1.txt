TRIAL OF CHESHIRE BEGINS.
(Judge Johnson Denies Motion to
Quash Indictment and Hears Argu
its for Directed Verdict,
Greenwood, Nov. 10.?When the
case of the United States against V.
B. C* shire of Anderson was called In
the United States court here this
morning Ernest F. Cochran of coun?
sel for the defense made a motion to
quash the Indictment and much time
waa taken up with the argument for
and against this motion. The conten?
tion for the defense was that the
statute under which the Indictment
was drawn was unconstitutional in
that congress exceeded the powers
granted it under the federal consti?
tution. At 1 o'clock Judge Johnson
overruled this motion, a Jury was
drawn and the witnesses for the gov?
ernment gave their testimony. At the
conclusion of the testimony for the
prosecution, counsel for the defense
Instead of offering testimony argued
for a directed verdict of acquittal.

irThls afternoon the Christian En?
deavor convention session was held in
the church and the Junior Christian
Endeavor meeting was held simul?
taneously fn the Sunday school room.
This was a feature because of the
fact that it is the first Junior conven?
tion which has ever been held. Sever?
al very interesting talks were made at
both meetings.
The Third Annual South Carolina
State Christian Endeavor convention
came to a most successful close Sun?
day night and the four hundred sev?
enty-five delegates this morning de?
parted to the different sections of the
State to their home societies to tell
them of the enthusiastic sessions
which were held and what had been
done at them to further the work in
the State. The features of the final
session were an address by Dr. Mel?
ton Clark of the Second Presbyterian
church at Charleston and the conse?
cration service by Karl Lehmann. The
trophy cup for the delegation pro
sentlng the most mileage was present?
ed to the Clemson College society.
One of the very pleasing features
of the convention came at the Satur?
day night's session, when Miss Claud?
ia Fraser, secretary of the local com?
mittee, who had done most of the
work in the plans to make the con?
vention a success, was presented a
handsome cameo brooch by the con?
vention for her much appreciated ser?
vices. The presentation was made by
Dr. Aiken of Chester in a pleasing lit?
tle speech. Miss Fraser has been
elected secretary of the State Union
for the ensuing year.
The closing session was attended by
perhaps the largest crowd of the con?
vention. The Presbyterian Church
was filled to capacity and many
turned away, as they were unable to
obtain seats. Dr. Clarke's address
was on the subject, "Who Then is
Willing to Consecrate His Services
This Day Tuto the Lord." Dr. Clark
urged the ronsocratlon of lives for
Ohlist, saying that It w:is impossible
to honor (Jod better than by giving the
Utmost, which was the consecration
of one's life for Christ ami humanity,

GITAQEL TO SUPPLY NEW GORPS
MADE ONE OF SEVEN OFFICERS'
TRAINING UNITS.
I Have Provided Necessary Courses In
Military Science Culled for In Reg?
ulations.
Washington, Nov. 19.?Six units of
the reserve officers' training corps,
five in the senior division and one in
the junior, have been established at
various educational Institutions by
army orders made public today. The
Citadel at Charleston is one.
Each of the institutions has com?
plied with the requirements of army
organization bill which created the
corps and the units established will
be infantry detachments.
The law requires that schools or
colleges coming under the act include
a two year compulsory military
course for all male students physi?
cally fit for Work. The institutions
named are the first to be awarded
units.
This recognition of the Citadel by
the war department will be good news
in South Carolina and is another in?
dication of its high position with the
federal authorities.

tion.
lives were wanted for Christ and there
was danger of one losing it in the
ci?use, there would be plenty of re^
sponses, but God called for a greater
thing than to give up life for Him.
He celled upon everyone present to
live for him, which was a harder
thing to do. In simple, but earnest
and eloquent language Dr. Clarke
pleaded that lives be lived for Jeaus
Christ I
The consecration service led by
Carl Lehmann sdeceeding Dr.
Clarke's address was by far the most
a^?!?^
the call whieh Dr. Clarke had ex?
tended. He told the Endeavorers
present that If they went home and led
the same lives as before they had at?
tended this convention, then the con?
vention had failed and they had
done themselves an injury by attend?
ing. They should have been so arous?
ed and enthused that they should lead
better, more consecratied lives for
Jesus Christ. He called upon all
those who would consecrate their lives
anew to Jesus Christ to hold up their
hands, and many hands went up. He
then called upon all who would give
whole-time service to Jesus Christ to
hold up their hands and five hands
went up, four young men and one
young woman.
The song service at the session was
led by Bert G. Jones, and Rev. J. P.
Marion, pastor of the church, led the
devotional services. The new offi?
cers were called upon the rostrum
and Karl Lehmann, in short but im?
pressive servire installed them in
their new offices. The new president,
Bert T. Corcoran of Charleston pre?
sided at the meeting last night.
I Mr. Matthews made the speech and
presented to the delegates from the
Clemson College Christian Endeavor
society the trophy cup for the
delegation with most mileage. The
Clemson delegates were called upon to
come to the front for this presnta
tion.
Other delegations which were an?
nounced as being worthy of honor?
able mention were those from Colum?
bia, Charleston, Bishopvllle, New
Harmony, Concord.
The report of the convention com?
mittee was read and adopted. It
called for harder work than ever be?
fore upon the part of Endeavorers
for the extension of the work, and
thanked God for the excellent work
which had been done during the past
year. The Sumter committees having
the prepaartions in charge for con?
vention, the officers, press and other
agencies employed In making the as?
sociation a Sil cross were given the
thanks and assured of the apprecia?
tion of the State union.
Saturday night the usual prelimin?
ary exercises of song service and de?
votional were held, after which the
president. Wyatt A. Taylor of Colum?
bia, Southern Held secretary, made a
striking exposition of the work which
had been accomplished and what the
organization was seeking to accom?
plish in this State Und in the Souiii.

Washington, Nov. 13.?President

the White House for a conference to?

with England, Germany, and Mexico.
The conference was to decide what

ed much amusement and was receiv?
ed with applause.
Mrs. L. L. Legiere made an earnest
plea for financial aid for Christian
Endeavor work, showing what could
be done for even small sums in the
mission field.
Sunday morning the Presbyterian
church was filled to capacity when
Dr. E. E. Gillespie of York preached
a forceful sermon from the text "Re?
member now Thy Creator in the Days
of Thy Youth." He emphasised the
fact that the greatest good for Christ
could be done only by starting out
early in youth in the Master's work.
In the afternoon the "Pep" session
led by J. G. Dinkins of Manning was
an interesting and pleasing event.
Short, but Instructive talks were made
by Elbert Hubbard of Hopewell; Miss
May Frank of Charleston, and John
Robertson Paul of Charleston on
how to get members Into the Chris?
tian Endeavor and hold their Interest
In the society. Talks were also made
by Lex Klutz of Chester, Miss Ora
Glenn of Rock Hill and R. T. Wilson
of Owings.
The message from the North Car?
olina State union delivered by the
president of that ?nlon, B. B. Rey?
nolds, was an inspiring one for the
South Carolina Endeavorers.
Later In the evening sample
Christian Endeavor prayer meetings
were held at the Christian Church,
led by E. W. Dabbs, Jr., Mayesville,
and at the Presbyterian church, led
by Robert Wodson of Clinton.
This morning the departure of the
delegates was fea'ured by the cheer?
ing of the Charleston delegation
which required a special coach. The
delegates were in the lighest of spir?
its and led by President Bert T.
Corcoran they cheered for Sumter, for
the members of the local committees,
for the field secretaries anc, even the
Atlantic Coast Line railroad, which
had supplied them with a speelal
eoach and given reduced 'ares for
the convention.
The station yard was packed for
nearly an hour between y and 10
o'clock and all of the delegates seem?
ed to be in the very best of spirits.
In fact one of the delegates was heard
to remark that cheerfulness was one
of the prime requisites of ? good En?
den vorer.
There were scores of the delegates
on the train for Charleston, and an
even larger number on the
train bound for Columbia, while other
trains earrled a ?oodly share of the
visitors away from the city.
