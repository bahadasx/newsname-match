DEMOCRATIC VICTORY
APPAR[TY C[RTAIM
California's Vote Turned
the Tables
WOODROW WILSON
DEFEATS OPPONENT
Although Early Iteturns Indleated the
Election of ('has. E. Hughes, the
Vote of the Western States Placed
Wilson in the Whtito House .Agnin.
New York, Nov. 1I.--Today's re
turns from Tuesday election served
only to increase the advantage of
President W\'ilsoni, who now seems as
sured of at least 272 and probably 2:71
votes in the electoral college. New
11ampshire, which has wavered from
Wilson to IIughes for three days, late
today dropped into the Denocratic col
umn by a plurality of 3 votes. This
V is on outi loted certi led returns in
tli hm nds of the secretary of siate.
The few additional return:; from
California and New Mxleo, d'd not
redcie \li. WNilson's lead in those
Statues. In addition the )i'mouat
found coifort in a lislia eb froi l..
A e les whlic h said that a difference
of only 6. 1 votes was fot'n!i betweep
the highest and lowest of the ')n1o
'ratie electors in the semi-official
(oi ulnt condicterd bythe ' iegistra' of
votes.
11leceion olilcialIs ixpressed the
opinion that these filgures made It-un
lik ely that the oleial ntilt would
split ('aliforila's electoral vote.
('orrect ed retuins fr'on Ramsay
county, Minnesota, today reduced
Charles E. Iughes' plurality in the
State to :2;, with less than thirty
prelincts unreported, but tonight the
first returns fronm the National
Guardsien on the border ran it up
to 2G. Political ex peits said this
niiade it virtually certain that the
State wotlt he swung by the two re
maining regiments on the iternta
tional line. About 2,)O0 votes were
(ast by the soldiers but they will not
be counted until next week,
It was 50t. hours after the polls had
closed in 'California when Chairmian
Rowell conceded that State to the
President and ended the suspense and
anxiety of an election which has been
unparalleled In Amierican political
history.
Iuli1lean Chairman Wilcox when
informed that the President had car
lied California only replied: "I have
nothing to say."
