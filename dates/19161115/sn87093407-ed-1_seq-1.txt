'LAWAND ORDER'
BODY HAS FIERY
SESSION AT CLUB
The threatened recall movement against Mayor Gill has practically been
launched.
That such action was about to be started had been rumored for several days.
Tuesday it materialized to the extent that a "law and order" meeting was called
at the Press Club theatre, and resolutions prepared by Judge Burke, Jay Thomas,
and James A. Wood, condemning the mayor, were passed.
I. k. Witherspoon, who acted as secretary, urged that "the meeting should
do just what it was called together to do, namely, condemn Mayor Cjill by or
ganizing a campaign to recall him."
Others, including W. C. Dawson and C .J. Smith, urged the same action after
Judge Burke had delivered a fiery speech.

Charges Unjust
The charges In the resolutions
that the mayor "failed to enforce
laws and ordinances" violated by
the Industrial Workers of the
World before they departed to Ev
erett "on their unlawful and mur
derous mission," the mayor branded
as "unjust."
"They are unjust because I had
no definite Information that any
one was going to Everett on an 'un
lawful and murderous mission '
"Had I known that these working
men were marching In 'military
formation to one of the dtv docks.'
1 would not have madly rushed
out and had them searched.
Have Right to Be Here
"The Elks, the Eagles and Y. M.
C. A. members, on an excursion,
might be expected to 'walk in mili
tary formation." I believe that I
am being done an Injustice by any
one who condemns without first
hearing tny side of the situation.

right, anil would not drive them out
of Seattle. It would bo an Injustice
to neighboring communities If I
tried, because we are able to handle
the situation right here better than
Auburn, Taconia. Everett.
I. W. W. Under Control
"The I W. W. situation has boon
under control here, and I intend to
keep it under control.
"After the Everett trouble we ar
rested these iw'oplo and held many
lof them, I believe, unlawfully. Hut
'no employer or bitter enemy of the
1. \\\ W. has noted this.
"In regard to the assemblage of
the I. .W. W.'a tn Seattle on th«
Sunday morning of the trouble, it
wag generally believed that the ex
cursion »« for the purpoae of hold-
Ins a free speech meeting in Ev
