PLEBEIAN FARE
FOR BANKER IN
HIS JAIL HOME
Knapp Loses Right of Fran
. chise Under Conviction
In Superior Court.
- ' '
MUST SERVE HIS
FULL 12 MONTHS
Dines In His Solitary : Cell
, On .Corned Beef and
v tiabbage J -
Instead of . nibbling ; at his usual
luncheon of chjcken a la King, Her
bert: M." Knapp, the convicted banker,
was confronted by-a steaming portion
of corned beef and cabbage when the
bell rang iiy the. county jail this noon.
He looked askance at the plebeian
fare but finally, surrendered to hunger
aid was soon performing a knife and
fork solo that would make a good
record for the phonograph. I
At the time this story opens our
hero was seated in Cell No. 1; to
which he was assigned yesterday after
he had been brought to Jail from the
county courthouse. He had cast aside
his red cravat as being a trifle too ex
treme for a man who is about to
spend the next 12 months in jail. In
stead he wore the conventional over
alls which are decreed by the Jail
fashion leaders. : ,
Mr. Knapp could not be chided for
his hunger for he had been toiling all
morning in the Jeather shop, making
big pieces of leather into little ones.
The dinner bell sounded to him like
the, chime of silver bells. As is cus
tomary! with prisoner who have ("re
ceived their sentences, the former
banker was placed this morning in the
custody of Frank E. Clark, who has
the labor contract at the jail.
Mr.; Clark thought the new prison
er would lend a touch of distinction
to the leather shop .which has fallen
off socially lately owing to the influx
of porch climVers and strong armmen.
The other convicts looked curiously at
Knapp when he was led into the room
but nobody was undiplomatic enough
to , remark," "Well, I see 'you got yours,
kid' or Anything like., that. : t
If Knapp hdd any idea rhe 'would
he allowed to eat delicacies in his cell
between regular meils" he was rudely
awakened for County Sheriff Pease
announcedHhat' h'6:f oodT'ejeeept small
quantities of frul; could be brought
in to prisoners. At prese hour the
fruit dealers ' h:ad ; not reported any
great rush by Knapp's depositors to
send him baskets of choice California
pears. . ,

er, convicted in ' the criminal superior
court., yesterday, upon, charges, of em
bezzlement, ili lose . his voting fran-;
chise. ' '. . - ; ', r ' ' . - ' r
Court officials announced today that
exception would be taken, in -the,, case -of
Knapp though it is popularly sup
posed that. because of , his Inoarcera
tion in a local jail his right' to vote in
Connecticut would be unimpaired. "
The , - constitutional . disenfranchise
ment will be made 'under section. 3 of
Article Sixth of the Connecticut State
constitution which reads as follows:
The privileges of ah elector shall be
forfeited by conviction - of - bribery,
forgery, perjury," duelling, "fraudulent
bankruptcy, theft, or other offence for
which an infamous , punishment is in
flicted." i
It is upon the last' clause, of this sec
tion which :' will debar Herbert M, .
Knapp from voting again in this state
unless by special act .of. the legislature.
A similar case, mae famous in the
courts of Connecticut by ' the efforts
of the disenfranchised to . regain his
right is that of Ralph' Borino"vs.Wil
liam Lounsbury, Registrar of Voters
of Bridgeport, tried " in the common
pleas court, "January 22, 1913, and re
quest denied. -' Borino had been arrest
ed In 1905 charged with, fraud. In the
lower court he was merely fined but
upon an appeal to the common pleas
court the finding of the lowei court
was sustained with the result that no
tice of disepfranchisement , was sent
by the clerk of the court to the regis
trar of votera-It was held upon trial
of Borino's suit for reinstatement that
the conviction was sufficient to war
rant the vote being taken from him.
As a further result of the conviction
of Knapp he will toe unable to obtain
the sought-fer discharge from bank
ruptcy under . the United States stat
utes which jartlculafly 1tar an embez
zler "rv person committing fraud when
acting in. a fiduciary capacity from
securing release from his debts.
'.The effect of' such a statute is to
prevent the embezzler from escaping
the consequences cf his acts civilly.
Knapp therefore is ' liable at any time
after his release from .Jail, and for a
perior . cf 17 years to suit upon judg-.
ments that may be obtained by . indi
vidual creditors'. 'if payment Judg
ment is not made, Knapp may.be
haled before a Justice of th3 peace or
other court -officer and made to , dis
close his financial status under oath,
his connection . and. receipts from any
business ventures-in which he may . be
or has been engaged. , - , .... .
Although it was reported yesterday
that Knapp would, get time off for .good
behavior this is not the fact. Sheriff
Pease said this morning that Knapp
will have to serve the full 12 months.
In cases where the sentence is mora
than a month on each count time i& al
lowed off, but Knapp's sentence was
one month on each of .12 counts..,. So
it will be time for another Thanksgiv
ing dinner when he walks out a free
man. .

HER FORTY DOGS
COULD NOT KEEP
CREDITORS AWAY
Wilton Woman; Says She'd
Rather Give 1 bash to
Hounds Tljan Heirs.
Although she kept 40 dogs on her
country , estate , a Wilton, Sarah L.

superior court this morning to explain
her troubles to Judge Gager. She is
suing the 'Citizens' National bank .ot
Yonkers, N. Y., to get an accounting
for $12,000 deposited there for her.
y This money was loaned by another
bank in New York state after Frank
E., Gardiner of Wilton had arranged
the matter. Before closing the loan
Gardiner told Mrs. Davenport she
must get rid of the dogs as the ex
pense of keeping them was too great.
"I'd rather give my money to the dogs
than to my heirs," Gardiner testified
she replied. She finally agreed to
let the dogs go, but Gardiner after
ward found she sent them to John
D. Rockefeller's kennels at Tarry
town, N.'Y.i where she had to pay $75
a week for their board.
'After the bank made the loan and
took a mortgage on the property Gar
diner checked it out to pay bills owed
by " Mrs. Davenport. ' She wants to
find out what became of all 'the
money. Mrs. Davenport is a sister of

The men have been counseled to

pressed to P. F. Duffy, who is leading
the strike, it is scarcely expected the
i desired raise in pay will be granted
tonight.
The fact that overtures are now be

the, men that their strike has been
successful so far. Labor leaders re
port that few non-union men have

FIND DEFECTS IN
VOTING MACHINES
IN TRIALS HERE
Retabulation Done Under
Direction of State's Attor
ney Lists Sealed.
The dramatic features of the . re
tabulation of election returns now In
progress in 'city hall consists in. -ae
machine upon which the. bell dfd not
ring, and another machine which' did
ndt record a portion of the- vote of
one of the minor parties. There were
also machines which showed " a dis
parity between the protective counter
"and the total counter. ' ' -
Th protective counter",, shows' the
number of times the machine has
been operated since It came into Use.
The total adder shows the number of
votes cast in the particular, election.
A machine to work perfectly should
show upon the protective counter an
increase of exactly equal to the num
ber shown on the total adder. .
The retabulation was conducted
without incident, except that the 'Re
publican organization, represented by
Registrar William Lounsbury, strongly
objected to having the sealed voting
lists taken from the machines, confided
to the custody of the superior-court:
Mr. Lounsbury insisted that the pa
pers should be given to the care of
Town Clerk Schultz. At one time this
difference , of opinion threatened to
suspend1 temporarily the work. , At
torney Phllo M. Calhoun, who repre
sents State Attorney Homer S. Cum
mings, 1 was about' to order a suspen
sion, when Mr. Lounsbury decided to
consult City Attorney William H.Com
ley.. Mr. Comley, in accordance with
agreement made under the direction
of Judge Edwin B. Gager. directed
that the lists be turned over to Clerk
Haviland- of the superior court.
. The -work of retabulation will take
two days more. It has been excel
lently organized by Attorney Calhoun
and the labor of , writing, checking
and examination is proceeding ex
peditiously. ' ' '
Thework is divided Into two main
parts. The records as theyappear on
the counting dials of the machines
are read off, Mr. Lounsbury reading,
while a representative of Mr. Calhoun
watches. The record is taken by . a,
checker, one for the Democrats ahd:
the 'other for the 'Republicans. When
the record is written down, the ma
chine is examined, under the super
vision of W. H. Church, an expert
brought in from Hartford. The seal
number, the total adder number and
the protective counter number are
recorded.
One machine is finished with before
Alternate machines are tried, by ad
ditions to the vote, and by voting af
ter the machine is cleared. The lever
is pulled over 101 times.
This takes "each counter through
each of its three wheels. The total
add is i observed to see if it shows 101
votes, and- the protective counter ; to
see if it shows an increase of 101. .
The machine is tried, to see if it Is
voting split tickets properly, and then
is put back again in the box and an
other one is brought forward. -
The object of this work is merely
to preserve the record. No compari
sons are made with any other records.
It is necessary to examine the ma
chines, because any defects in them
would not be known, otherwise, since
they were to be cleared for the special
election of Nov. 25.
The results of the retabulation will
be preserved for future use, in case
the Investigation now proceeding shall
show a necessity for them.' f

Federal Department
to Defend Measure
Washington, Nov. 15 Attorney
General Gregory has decided that .
suits by 'railroads against " enforceent .
of the Adamson eight?hour law, will
be defended by the r department of
justice. The defense'to 'be presented
in each case will be worked out , be
tween Solicitor ' General Davis and
other department officials with United ,
States attorneys in" various Jurisdicr
tions. -
The department today was unable '
to determine whether it would be :
necessacy to defend each of the many
suits already begun or whether the
railways would be content to make a
test case of one suit. No wor,d as '
reached'the attorney general from, the
railroads suggesting such a " course
and if such a proposal is not made
each suit will be defended. .
' Reports that railroad and Brother-
hood officials had considered a sug
gestion that Mr. Gregory be asked to
suspend operation of " the Adamson
law for 30 days were .met withthe v
statement that the attorney general'
has no such . authority and that his
only course is to defend the suits or.
let them go -by . default. ;.;..

Conferences on Bill
' New York, Nov. 15 Railway man- .
agers comprising the..National.Cpn-'
ference 'Committee continued today
consideration bf whether wholesale
legal action., to defeat the Adamson
eight-hour law will be taken or
whether a limited . series of injunc
tions will be filed. Tjie concensus of
opinion "was said to favor the former
course, which "would result in - ap- 1
proximately' 5,000 actions, covering ,
entire: railroad territory of the United
States. . Whichever method is select
ed, the cases are expected to be in the
courts within 10 days.-
In 'view of " the fact that the New
lands committee'' is f to, hold public
hearings on- the railroad situation '
generally beginning 'next 'Monday
there was an indication that definite
action would., be postponed until the
conclusion of these hearings.
; The brotherhoods, lit was announc-.
ed, will not contest the suits to be in
stituted by the roads. They contend
that the duty logically1 devolves upon
the attorney-general . and . will, look to
the judicial branch of the government
to fight their battle. : - . 1
