Chickasha Nov. 20 to Capture Great

Chickasha is going after the Ozark
Trail wilh a big bunch of boosters
and a band.
This was the decision reached in a
jiffy at a meeting held at the Com
mercial and Farm bureau room Tues
day evening, presided over by County
Commissioner J. A. Robinson.
It was planned to send at least 100
tars to the Ozark Trail convention in
Oklahoma City next week and a list
Of volunteers for the expedition was
started. Ed Burton was the first man
to suggest taking the band, doiijg bo
by subscribing S3 to help defray the
expenses of the same, and others pres
ent quickly followed HUit.
Word was received by Mr. Robin
sou that over a hundred cars of boos
ters from towns all the way west to
Mangum will reach here Monday, No
vember ZO, and through Secretary Sin
gleterj of Mangum, Ohiekasha was
invited to join the procession.
A committee consisting of Ed Bur
ton. L. C. Hutsou, M. F. Courtney, J.
P. Wolverton and Karl Burton was
appointed to line up the largest possi
ble delegation of car owners and get
up the crowd. that will accompany
thorn, V.it; e, tr-aaiittcfc also wuing
instructed to raise the remainder of
the fund necessary for employing the
band.
Mr. Wolvertou was not present at
the meefing but he sent word that he
was ready to donate $100 toward im
Droving the p-oposed road in Grady
county and would take one or more
cars to Oklahoma City. Mr. Barton
said ho would do the same thing. "I
havo recently traveled over one of
tho national highways through New
Mexico and Arizona," he said, "and I
have seen what such a road means to
tho country. Ono who has not seen
it can havo no idea of the amount of
travel over these roads. Tourists are
going and coining all the time and
every one of them leaves more or less
money in every town through which,
the road passes." Dr. E. L. Dawson,
who traveled over tho same section
recently, concurred in what Mr. Bar
ton said, and urged that Chickasha
should lose no time in getting the
Oi.ark Trail, if possible.
Col. Harvey, the head of the Ozark
Trail association, announced that
Chickasha would bo passed up, follow
ing his trip hero a few weeks ago,
but it was the concensus of opinion
that he would change his mind when
confronted by the arguments advanc
ed by the Chickasha boosters, backed
up by tho delegations from towns to
tho w-est.
It was agreed that the chances for
routing the proposed road southwest
from Oklahoma' City would depend
largely upon tho bridging of the South
Canadian. This matter was discussed
ut some length, and the view was ex
pressed that Oklahoma City should
carry out her plan to build a bridge
at New Castle. It was also brought
out that Minco is busy with plans for
a low-water bridge at Union City. The
bridge matter will be taken up by the
delegation going to the Oklahoma City
convention and it is thought that a
solution of tho problem will be work
ed out.

GOOD RECORD MADE BY
GRADY COUNTY AGENT
The summary of the annual report
of tho county agent which was sub
mitted orally last night to the meet
ing of tho Commercial and Farm bu
reau, presented some interesting facts
and figures relating to the progress of
Grady county farmers and the work
that is being done by the county
agent, O. C. Cooper.
The present year has been a pros
perous one in boys and girls' clubs
circles and SIM. members were enroll
ed in the seven clubs, corn, cotton,
pigs, kaffir corn, feterita, milo maize
and peanuts.
During the year besides the boys
and girls demonstrators there were
fiftv-three adult demonstrations in
different parts of Grady county, in
cluding those in alfalfa, corn, cotton,
kaffir corn, sweet clover, barley, rye,
wheat and oats.
Grady county had the largest club
rally this year in the southwest and
photographs were shown where 319
members of boys and girls clubs were
lined up on Chickasha avenue prepar
atory to going to Shanoan Springs,
the line reaching from the Farm bu
reau to the Geronimo hotel. On this
occasion the admission of ninety-six
members was paid into the swimming
pool and five street cars were engag
td to take them to the grounds.
Grady county this year had the larg
est number of township exhibits at
its free fair of any county in the state,
eighteen competing for prize:?;
of the fourteen county fairs in the
state of Oklahoma which State Su
perintendent R. II. Wilson had judged
he declared Grady county's to be the
best. A great improvement was made
in the stock and other exhibits over
the preceding year. Every dollar has
been paid for premiums awarded.

By United frreaa.
New York, Nov. 13. Leaders of the j
brotherhoods of railway trainmen i
here insist that they will go through j
with their strike threat in January if;
court decisions emasculate tho eight
hour program.
Railroad attorneys are rapidly fil
ing actions. Though one test may be
used, all the roads want to be involv
ed, so that the penalty clause will not
react against them.
It is reported that tho unions may
lay their side of the matter before
President Wilson next week.
RECENT CHANGES
IN CO. TEACHERS
Several changes in teachers for the
county schools have been made in the
past few days as announced by Coun
ty Superintendent M. H. Shepard be
fore his departure for the north end
of tho county today. In the Old Trail
district the tencher of the one-room
school resigned after a week's service
on account of finding no suitable
place to board. His place was taken j
by F. W. Robbins of that district who ;
lias been attending the University of
Oklahoma.
In the Harris district the teacher i
resigned and O. W. Reed was engag
ed to take his place. -
There is a vacancy in the Starr dis-j
triet which may be filled by an appli-.
cant who left yesterday afternoon for i
that vicinity.
During the year 892 hogs have been
vaccinated for cholera by the county
agent and 562 head of cattle were vac
cinated for blackleg.
The deadly parallel presented be
tween the work, done by the boys on
their demonstration plats and the re
sults attained during the year by the
average Grady county farmer was
presented by the county agent. The
boys, by plowing tho ground four or
five or six times during and succeed
ing the dry spell, made an average of
3G bushels of corn to the acre while
the farmers in the county averaged
not over u0. Those farmers who did
as the boys did in the preparation for
crops got 10, 50 and 00 bushels to the
acre.
With cotton the same results were
achieved. Four boys made a fraction
over three-quarters of a bale to the
acre in their cotton plats, six made a
fraction over a half bale and the oth
ers made a half bale. The men aver
aged one-half bale to the acre on their
farms. Thoso men who farmed in the
same manner as the boys made as
much cotton to the acre as did the
boy 3.
The books are now open for boys
and girls club members for next year
and over 100 applications of boys and
girls are already on file. It is hoped
to bring this number up to 3o0 before
the books close on January 1.
Tho boys ,the county agent assert
ed, had won distinction outside of
their county through their persistent
efforts to advance in farming. Two
state prizes will come to Grady coun
ty as one of ten contestants in both
tho kaffir corn and corn exhibits at
the state fair. "We want 300 boys and
girls to join our clubs next yetr," de
clared Mr. Coojwr in conclusion.
Sensational Liquor Case Takes Up Day in
Federal Court With Sam Houston's
Son a Witness
SWIFT JUSTICE IS
METED TO BOOTLEG'RS
Juries as Yet Have Returned No Acquit
tals on Liquor Charges and Sev
eral Convictions
The federal petit juries are making
short shrift of the prisoners who are
being brought before them on liquor
charges.
On the first day Sam Clark, former
ly of Chickasha and later of Com
merce, was found guilty of introduc
ing and yesterday afternoon two more
defendants met with tho same fate,
being joint defendants In a single
cause. These were Leo Harris and
Gilbert Harris of Ryan who were also
charged with Introducing. Tho jury
returned a verdict of guilty at about
4 o'clock while the trial of the United
States vs. Bill Dossett on the same
charge was in progress.
Dossett attempted to make capital
out of an alleged infirmity. While
under examination at his preliminary
before Judge Hamilton in Chickasha
he pretended to be so lame that he
could scarcely walk but when, in his
belie!", he was out of sight of the dep
uty United States marshal ho. pro
ceeded to sprint in the most approved
Cushion.
The same means of defense, in-order
to have. his trial stayed, was at
tempted this week but it proved to
b(- unavailing. The ieiort reached
die ears of the attorney and the court
that Dossett was in such a pitiable
condition that he had been taken to
':i Reno for an operation. The judge,
hovever, had had evidence to the con
trary and Dossett was forced to ap
pear for trial.
Bill Dossett was fonnd guilty as
charged in the indictment," the jury re
turning the verdict this morning.
Among the most sensational cases
on the docket this term is that which
is on trial this afternoon and in which
William R. Houston, son of General
Sam Houston of t one Star fame, is
the principal prosecuting witness. The
case is that of the United States vs.
Robert K. Warren and Wright Bom
ford for Introducing liquor and comes
from Choctaw county, where both men
hold high positions. Warren is the
county attorney and Bomford a pros
perous end wealthy real estate and
loan agent. The two men,' it seems,
while in an automobile, were arrested
by Houston, who is a special enforce
ment officer in tho department of In
dian affairs, while returning from a
trip to Arthur City, Texas, and hav'is
in their possession at the time, it is
said, intoxicating liquor which, both
declared to be for their own use.
Whether or not a man can "introduce"
for his own use is the question which
will havo to be decided by the jury
when the arguments are closed this
afternoon.
Civil Cases.
Two civil cases were disposed of in
the federal court yesterday. Both of
these dismissals were for want of
prosecution. They were for damages
for personal injuries against the Atch
ison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad
company,, the plaintiffs being Tracy
Sweet and G. H. Deaton.
Why Grand Jury Meets.
Tho indications are that tho federal
grand jury, which began its labors in
the federal building yesterday, will
not conclude its deliberations until
Friday or possibly Saturday. With
good link It may be accomplished by
Friday.
The holding of the grand jury in
Chickasha in November is an unusual
' proceeding made expedient and imper
ative in order not to do an injustice
to the large number of prisoners who
. are now In jail awaiting its action
and whose cases came up too late for
the October panel In Ardmore. The
work of the Ardmore grand jury was
exceptionally arduous, over 2"0 cases
having ' been investigated covering
every violation of tho United States
1 statutes and including such offenses
as counterfeiting
misappropriation.,
