Reibt Ivo to his race in the
Ninth District for Congress, K.
1.cc Trinkle issued the follow?
ing statement at his ollico here
today:
To the voters of tho Ninth
District of the State of Vir?
ginia:
While, of coarse, 1 regret that
tin- Ninth District was not re?
deemed lo Democracy in tin'
battle of tho 7lh of November,
still I eon not help but feel that
the light has cemented our par?
ty, and will hring its results in
t he fut lire.
Mo one COtthl be moro appre?
ciative than 1 am of the noble
and genuine service that was
rendered to mo in the race by
ihy friends and by the party as
a whole. Our defeat can main?
ly be attributed to two causes,
vi/.: the fact that the poll taxes
of the Democrats of the Ninth
District were largely unpaid,.
and that ife hail to meet a most
determined light on the part of
our opponents and against very
heavy odds.
We should be appreciative:
1?To our Campaign Mana?
ger. Mr. Frank Ii. (-aidwell, of
Bristol, who labored unceas?
ingly in behaif of our cause,
and who rendered service which
should never be forgotten by
our party. One unacquainted
with the fact can never realize
the faithful service that he ren?
dered.
?J?Great service was render-'
ed by the Stale and District
Committees with their respec?
tive Chairmen.
. :i?A more loyal band to our
cause could not be found than
our County Committees with
their respective Chairmen.
4? We should ever he appre?
ciative of the generous spirit of
those who so freely and volun?
tarily contributed to the legiti?
mate expenses of the campaign,
thus evincing their genuine in
torcst in tho cause of Demo?
cracy.
5? The Democratic, newspa?
pers of the State and District
have each and every ouo ren?
dered valiant service, and 1
wish to say to their credit that
not one askn I for remuneration.
ti?Tho rank and tibi of the
party was never moro aroused,
more enthusiastic, and more
aggressive than they were in
this fight, thus showing that
our party, oven in tho face of
many defeats in this District,is
still alive with the spirit of
Democracy.
7?The entire District and
State is due a debt of gratitude
to the speakers who campaign?
ed in the District. All volun?
tarily offered their service-,and
bore their.own personal pxpuu
ses. ')?
* 8?To my Republican friends,
who supported me, I wish to
extend most sincere thanks.
'.) ? 1 want to extend my ap?
preciation to those who have
written and telegraphed mo
since tho result of the election
became known, the number be?
ing so great that it is practical?
ly impossible to respond by per?
sonal replies.
1 trust that the Democratic
newspapers of the District will
copy this statement in order
that all of my friends may have
knowledge of my appreciation
for the service they rendered.
I am glad to have played an
humble part in making the
figlu, and I accept the defeat at
the hands of the electorato of
the District with the hope and
confidence that nil will be well
und for the best interest of our
Government, our Nation, and
our State.
Very reapoctfullv,
