With the battle betwen the British'
and Germans raging around Ancre
liook, the Germans have struck the
V nch a hard blow at the other ex
tremity of the Somme front. Paris
declared the Germans gained at only
one place. , , ; ' ."
The latest from the Ancre region
said the British were pressing on be
3 end the village of Beaufort-Sur-Ancre.
London announced that more
m 5,000 prisoners had been taken,
orlin admitted the British took
court but . said their ' attacks
: down at other points north of
me. Paris said the French
gress in the St. Pierre-Vaast
where the possession of
,. - 'at ' Saillisel facilitated
"their work. . ' ,
, Berlin announced a successful Teu
tonic invasion of Rumania and de
clared that more than 1,800 prisoners
weer taken yesterday in battles along
,the road into Wallachia, southwestern
Rumania. "J:' ; '
Petrograd announced that Ruman
ians in the Trigujuily, Alt and Jiul
valleys were forced back by the Teu
tons, who had received heavy rein
forcements. :
Russian attacks yesterday south
east of Lemberg in Galicia were re
pulsed, the Germans announced.
ENTENTE ADVANCE
The Rumanians announced the oc
cupation, of Boasic in the Dobrudja,
today by the entente forces.
A COMPLETE SURPRISE
The Germans were apparently com
pletely, surprised by Monday morn
ing's attack in the valley of the" Ancre.
An evidence of this was found in the
fact that the garrison of the trenches
around Beaumont Hamel were pre
paring for breakfast at the moment
when the British infantry stormed the
position. The British, after partially
clearing the underground galleries
and rounding up 700 prisoners, pro
ceeded to eat their prisoners' break
fast, telling the captives they would
be fed when they arirved in the Brit
ish lines. ''.
A total of nearly 4,000; prisoners
was sent to the rear, including a reg
imental commander who was captur
ed in a dugout with a major, an adju
tant and a number of other officers.
The majority of the prisoners are
isn oiiicers very inferior righting ma
terial. The German higher command
depended apparently upon the sup
posedly impregnable character of the
old front line and its strongly forti
fied villages rather than on the stam
ina of the troops. The British officers
believe the Germans withdrew their
best men for service elsewhere on the
I British front where the new and shal-
I lower positions to which the defend-
ers have been formed demand greater
power on the part of the infantry.
LOSSES UNUSUALLY LIGHT
The British losses -were unusually
light owing probably to the unexpect
edly feeble support of -the German
machine gun fire at Beaumont-Hamel
and St. Pierre-Devion. Large numbers
of German dead were found strewn
in the wrecked trenches of the orig
inal mam line. This line consisted of
four parallel rows of trenches, the
hst being flush with the western face
of Beaumont-Hamel.

Factory Up Again
Most of our people will remember
the soap factory, which began busi
ness over on Lincoln Heights several
months ago, but after making a few
runs of soap suspended operations.
- Mr. W. L. Colbert, now county tax
collector, has leased the plant, and on
laying down the cares of his public
office on the first of the year, will put
the factory in operation again.
The plant was well built and equip
ped with up to date machinery, and
during the short time it was operated
turned out a good brand of soap. Mr.
Colbert is an excellent business man,
and will make the venture a success
if anyone can. It is an enterprise
that Ocala should heartily support,
and the Star hopes that our business
men will make a memorandum right
now to give it all the business they
can. '

Wilson's Of f er of Mediation Will
Be Welcomed
OPTIMISTIC GPiniOH EXPRESSED TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
(Associated Press)
Berlin, Nov. 13 (Delayed). The
beginning of peace negotiations may,
perhaps, be expected with fair pros
pects of success during the coming
winter,, in the opinion of Count Albert
Apponyi, the Hungarian leader and
former Hungarian premier. This
opinion was expressed in an interview
with an Associated Press correspond
ent. Negotiations cannot be expected
until the Teutonic Rumanian cam
paign is finished, he said. He believ
ed that Rumania would be crushed
soon. Count Apponyi declared the
statesmen of opposing camps were
drawing together. The British no
longer talk of crushing Germany, and
the agitation for annexation in Ger
many is dying out.
Count Apponyi saw no reason why
neutral mediation shouldn't be wel
comed at the proper moment and
knew no reason why President Wil
son shouldn't be the intermediary.

JOSEPHINE ANDERSON
Many of our people will be grieved
to kn6w that Josephine Anderson, who
since earlychildhood served us faith
fully as nurse, cook and housemaid,
died Monday night at nine o'clock at
her home in Ocala and was buried
this morning. The remains were fol
lowed to their last resting place by
sorrowing relatives and friends. She
was born at Crystal River in 1877 and
moved with her mother, Amanda
Harmon and family to' Ocala when
quite a child. She was married to
Lee Anderson at the age of nineteen.
She has faithfully devoted her care
and attention to her growing family,
training them in the ways of indus
try and service. She was true to her
religious principles to the point of sac
rifice and firmly followed the straight
and narrow path of love and duty,
through all the years of her life. Fail
ing health required her to take the
two older girls from school while she
bravely fought the good fight and
complained not.
Verily her children rise up and call
her blessed. Her church and family
will mourn her; her race will miss her
and the loyal white friends will find
none to take, her place. - Their visits,
flowers and words of sympathy bore
testimony to the worth of this good
colored woman. We sincerely wish
there were more like her. Let us do
all in our power to help the six
motherless children left in a desolate
home. Mrs. Geo. W. Martin.

Says An-American Clergyman, Who
Commands a Battalion in the
British Army
London, Nov. 14. Lieutenant Col
onel F. C. Bullock, of New York state,
the only clergyman in the world to
command a battalion of troops, is now
in London, where, without doffing his
khaki, he has been preaching in a
Unitarian church. He is in command
of one of the American Legion bat
talions raised in Canada. Altogether
there are five battalions of American
citizens raised in Canada and attach
ed to the Canadian forces. In the
first,. 825 men recruited and twenty
five of the forty-eight states in the
Union were represented.
In answer to a question why. he, an
American minister, had joined the
British army as a combatant, the col
onel said:
"I hold it is wrong to tell another
man to go out and shoot without you
go and do likewise. The men I have
the. privilege of commanding, and
more, came voluntarily. They realiz
ed, as I did, that this was a war of
principles, not of nations, and that
the United States was affected by the
outcome just as .much as the allied na
tions. "It was a question whether the
mailed fist should rule civilization or
whether the principle of the Man
whose fists were nailed to the cross
should prevail. But the sinking of
the Lusitania was the casting of the
die. Then I announced I had furled
my flag, that it never again should
bo caressed by the breezes until the
country which had been so long my
home had declared itself against such
a damnable outrage,
i "I then took a commission and
combatant rank and helped to raise a
battalion of Americans to fight. That
one battalion grew into eight," added
the colonel with a satisfied smile.
"In America," he continued, "there
i3 an ubiquitous sign, 'Safety First.'
There is no more ignoble cry unless
it be To proud to fight,' as honer
comes before safety. Righteousness
and justice take precedence when it
comes to a question of pride and fight
ing."
