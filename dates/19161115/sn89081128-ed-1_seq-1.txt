VOLUME XXXVII.
CITY REPRESENTED
AT FARGO MEETING
CIL AUTHORIZES MAYOR
TO SELECT DELEGATION OF
HIS OWN.
CONSIDERABLE BUSINESS IS
TRANSACTED AT REGULAR
MEETING.
Mayor Fritsche was authorized to
select such delegates to represent New
Ulm at the joint drainage meeting of the
Northwestern states, Minnesota, North
and South Dakota, held at Fargo Mon
day and Tuesday of this week, as he
desired, by the City Council, at its
regular session last Wednesday night.
The mayor explained that he was going
to attend the conference at his own
expense, but felt that it was but just that
the towns to be affected by the movement
should be well represented, and re
quested the council to appoint one or
more gentlemen to accompany him
Assistant Fire Chiefs Appointed.
Considerable business was transacted
in the two hours session by the city
fathers, most of whom were pretty well
tired out from a day and night's work
on the election boards the day before.
At the request of Chief Henry Engel,
Joseph F. Groebner was appointed first
istant, and Fred Pfaender second
chief of the fire department.
The Healy Plumbing & Heating Com
pany was allowed an estimate of $2,277.
75 on its contract for sewer and water
works construction, and $1,230 was
allowed on the contract of Held &
Haeberle for grading North State street.
The St. Paul concern requested an
extension of time for the completion of
its contract for the construction of a
sewer on Front street, which was to have
been finished today. The Healy com
pany explained that additional machinery
needed for the work that the nature
tt che soil was such that hand digging,
especially with the present scarcity of
help it would be a physical impossibility
to complete the job at the time specified
in the contract. The company said it
might be next spring before the neces
sary machinery could be secured The
council granted an extension, but no
time was specified as to how long the
extension would last.
The Gem Theatre license was tranb
f/ffred from Schreier & Stohlmann to
xxrcto Zupfer, who will conduct that
amusement house the future.
A bill of $1,872 for the construction of a
shed for storing the street working
machinery caused considerable discus
sion. It appears that haste was neces
sary when the building was authorized
and the street committee was instructed
to proceed at once. After the building
had been completed it was found that it
had cost considerably more than was ex
pected, and some of the alderman thought
that for all work of that nature the
council should irsist upon advertising for
bids and letting the work go through the
,regular channel. After considerable dis
cussion the bill was allowed.

REAL WINTER HITS
ENTIRE NORTHWEST
MERCURY GOES TO 26 BELOW
AT SOME POINTS IN THE
NORTHWEST
POOR PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT A
WINTER OF HIGH PRICES
WILL MEAN
This section of the country has been
getting its first real touch of winter.
October 18 New Ulm experienced its
first snow storm of the season, but the
temperatures were comparatively high
during the period of storm, which lasted
for two or three days.
Coldest of Season.
Yesterday morning was the coldest of
the season so far, the thermometer
registering at 4 degrees above zero.
Unusually cold weather has prevailed
throughout the West and Northwest for
the past three or four days, and new
November low records have been made
in Wyoming, North and South Dakota,
Nebraska and Montana.
In Western South Dakota the ther
mometer registered as low as 12 below
zero. At Sheridan, Monday, it was 26
below, at Lander 24 below at Cheyenne

In Western Minnesota and Eastern
South Dakota mercury stood at zero.
Minneapolis was warmer then New
Ulm Monday, the temperature being 5

Considerable suffering in the larger
cities is reported. Many fires resulted in
many places from overheated furnaces
and stoves, and coal men have been
swamped with orders.
Overcautious parents near Minne
apolis caused the death of a small child
Monday. Fearful that it would suffer
from the cold they wrapped the little one
up so tightly that it was smothered to
death when unwrapped.
MYSTERIOUS ROBBERY
$300 CASH IS MISSING
A mysterious robbery occurred at the
home of Matt Peterson, sometime during
the night of Thursday, November 9.
Mr. Peterson conducts a saloon at the
corner of Front and First North streets.
On closing his place Thursday evening,
according to the story he told Chief of
Police John Herzog, he gave a bag con
taining $350 to his step-daughter, Bar
bara Peterson, to take care of until morn
ing. This she placed in a dresser drawer
in her bed room and retired. When she
awoke the next day, at about 10 a. m.
the money together with about $30, be
longing her sister, Mrs. Edwards, was
missing, thieves having entered the room
while the young woman slept.
Part oi the money was in checks, but
Mr. Peterson is unable to say just how
much was bank paper and how much
currency. He notified the banks to stop
payment on the checks, but could not say
whom the checks were drawn to. They
had been cashed by him for Eagle Mill
employes.
It was not until 5*30 Friday evening
that he notified the police of the robbery
and they have been working on the case
ever since, but so far without result.
The thieves had too great a start to should make his wishes known to the

SOCIETY OBSERVES
SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY
MEMBERS OF LOCAL TURNERS'
ORGANIZATION GATHER AT
BANQUET.
LADIES JOIN MEN FOLKS IN
CELEBRATION OF GALA
EVENT.
Saturday evening the New Ulm Turn
verein celebrated its 60th anniversary
and the Ladies Society its 27th anni
versary. The function consisted of a
banquet with a program of toasts and
music followed by a dance. The mem
bers of both societies met in the large
hall and at 7:30 p. m. formed on for
a grand march to the strains of the
Spinner orchestra and marched into
the small "hall where the attractively
decorated banquet tables were waiting
for them.
Henry Engel, President of the Turn
verein bade all of them welcome and
expressed the hope that every one would
spend an enjoyable evening. Herman
Hein acted as toastmaster and members
of the Zoeghngs class were pressed into
service as waiters. The viands were
excellent and the ladies in charge of the
preparation of the chicken and other
delicacies received more than one com
pliment.
The musical part of the program con
sisted partly of community singing,
three songs being sung by all those
present. Miss Henrietta Hauenstein de
lighted the audience with a piano solo
and was called upon for an encore. The
ladies trio, Mrs. W. G. Alwin, Mrs. L.
G. Bell and Mrs. Herman Hein, never
sang better than Saturday evening. They
also responded to an encore. The only
other musical number on the program
was a piano duet by the Misses Frieda
Behnke and Aleen Seiter who could not
be prevailed upon to play a second
selection. Mrs. John Schapekahm re
cited a poem which proved so acceptable
that she was called upon again and yet
again. Her encores were decidedly hu
morous.
Mrs. Geo. Schmidt, President of the
Turner Frauenverem spoke briefly of the
activities and achievements of the
ladies' society within the past year and
as evidence of their activity presented
to the New Ulm Turnverein their savings
for the past year amounting to the sum
of $600. On behalf of the Turner Society
the President thanked them for the
magnanimous gift and paid the members
of the Frauenverein a well deserved
compliment for their untiring efforts on
behalf of the Turnverein.
Capt. Frank Burg, one of the veteran
members of the society spoke briefly
about the growth of New Ulm from
small beginnings to its present size and
beauty, all the work being done by the
people of New Ulm without calling upon
the Rockefellers and Carnegies for as
sistance.

SKAT TOURNAMENT AT COBDEN
SATURDAY
Saturday of this week the local skat
players will stage a skat tournament at
Cobden, having accepted the kind invita
tion of Julius Krause, the Mayor of
Cobden, to help him in his efforts to put
his bailiwick on the skat map. This invita
tion was extended to the skat players
at their weekly tournament at Turner
Hall Monday evening and was enthusias
tically accepted. Fifteen immediately
expressed their willingness to attend.
This means at least twenty-four will go
if the weather is at all propitious.
Some of the onkels will go by train, but
the most of them plan to travel by auto.
Those who desire to go by car should not
fail to make reservation with either Otto
Oswald or Dr. J. P. Graff at once so that
all can be accomodated. Every one
anticipates a royal time and if the live
wires of Cobden are in their usual form
the New Ulm contingent will be able to
put Saturday down as a red letter day.
The attendance at Monday's tour
nament was the best this season. Skat
was played at seven tables. Theo.
Manderfeld won the first prize with 22
net games to his credit Jos. Sondag the
second prize with 638 net points and
Herman Raabe made the unusual play
of winning a heart solo against five
matadores, thus winning the third prize.
There is still room in the local club and
any one who is a friend of the game and
desires to affiliate himself with the club

NEW ULM, BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, NOV. 15, 1916.
CAR SHORTAGE IS
SERIOUS PROBLEM
SITUATION IN NORTHWEST IS
DECLARED MOST ACUTE IN
YEARS.
NEW ULM SHIPPERS
FROM, CONDITIONS
1
SUFFER
WITH
OTHERS.
Shippers of New Ulm, like those of all
the rest of the country, are hit by the
acute car shortage, which the railroads
are experiencing at the present time.
Agent Leary of the Minneapolis & St.
Louis, says there never has been a time
in the memory of the oldest railroader
when the situation has been so serious
as for the past three weeks.
"It has been bad enough for more
than three months, but never so serious
as since about the middle of October,"
he said. "It is simply impossible to get
sufficient rolling stock to handle the
traffic. This applies especially to box
cars in condition to ship flour, which of
course, is tjhe principal commodity going
qut of New Ulm. We are not so bad off
for flats and gondolas, but we are way
way behind when it comes to handling
flour."
Demurrage Will Be Expensive.
December 1 the new demurrage rules
will go into effect, when it is expected
there will be some relief. On that date
there will be a radical change in those
rules. Under the present rates, shippers
are allowed forty-eight hours in which
to unload a car, after which they are
charged $1 a day demurrage. Beginning
with the first of next month, they will be
allowed the usual time for unloading,
but for over-time it will be decidedly
expensive to hold a car. For the first
day after the expiration of the forty-eight
hour limit, $2 will be charged the second
day, $3 third day $4, and $5 a day for
eaoh dayjuap'tit is released. This is for
-interstate "traffic only, and the new rate
was made at the instigation of the Inter
state Commerce Commission, in the hope
that by that method the situation might
be relieved.
The car shortage exists throughout
the Northwest, the Twin Cities being
practically cut off from all supplies
Shippers Are Alarmed.
Shippers all over this section of the
country are alarmed over the prospects
they expect to face with the closing of
the Great Lakes shipping season. While
the closing of the lake traffic is in itself
considered a serious handicap in the
Northwest, the general situation has been
found worse than was expected by the
attitude of the Canadian railroads.
A short time ago Minneapolis grain
men purchased 150,000 bushels of Cana
dian wheat on the strength of the wide
difference of price between the Winnipeg
and Minneapolis exchanges. The prices
there had dropped to a point where the
Minneapolis men thought it would be
profitable to buy on the Canadian market
and ship to the United States and pay
the duty. Now it transpires that no
shipments can be promised, as the rail
roads of Canada have taken a stand
against permitting any of their cars to
cross into the United States, where they
say they may be lost for years.
Some time ago it was discovered that
Eastern and Southern roads were failing
to return cars to the Northwestern roads,
once they had been permitted to slip
through Chicago. The roads then at
tempted to prevent their equipment
getting beyond the limits of the metrop
olis at the head of Lake Michigan, and
headed off this system of car "stealing"
to a certain extent, but not on large
enough a scale to be very effective.
Junction Points May Be Key.
The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion has requested that it be furnished
The request was based on testimony,
given by railroad officials, in a hearing
in connection with an investigation as
to the methods of an exchange of cars
by the railroads.
The principal drawback to New Ulm
shippers is that the bulk of the ship
ments from this point is that only first
class cars may be used. It is impossible
to ship flour in-anything bat box cars
in the best of'*s£ndition. Cars that have
had coal or other like commodity, can
not be used for, flour.

Firemen's Relief Association resolutions

John L. Hoffmann, for many years a
member of the New Ulm Fire Depart
ment, and also of the relief association,

ACCUSED ROBBERS
QUICKLY CAPTURED
TWO
OF
MEN, BELIEVED THIEVES
SLEEPY EYE STORE IN
HURON JAIL.
SHERIFF IS ON WAY WITH THE
NECESSARY EXTRADITION
PAPERS.
Two men, giving their names as Tom
Kennedy and William Smith, are in jail
at Huron, S. D., charged with robbing
E. P. Bertrand & Son's harness shop at
Sleepy Eye, and George Wurmstein's
saloon at Springfield, on the night of
Monday, November 6.
Loads Sold at Tracy.
La£e^ Thursday jnigbt^ Sheriff William
J. Julius received a telephone message
from the authorities at Tracy to the
effect that some of the plunder, in
cluding a number of knives, taken from
the Bertrand store, had been sold in that
place, and that about thirty of the knives
had been recovered. The message said
that the vendors of the knives had left
town, and an officer was requested to
come at once and identify the plunder.
Sheriff Julius immediately left for that
place.
Early Friday morning Deputy Sheriff
H. F. Jahnke received a telegram from
the sheriff at Huron, conveying the in
formation that two men had been ar
rested there, while disposing of goods
described as those stolen from both
Sleepy Eye and Springfield. He com
municated the information to Sheriff
Julius, who was still at Tracy, and that
officer proceeded on to the South Dakota
city.
The property in the possession of the
men, and the prisoners themselves, were
identified, the latter as the ones who had
been selling it. They, however, refused
to return to Minnesota without ex
tradition papers and the sheriff returned
Sunday morning for the desired docu
ments.
Goes After Requisition.
Sheriff Julius left Monday afternoon
for St. Paul to obtain the necessary
papers from Governor Burnquist, going
from there direct to Pierre, S. D., that
the governor of that state may honor the
Minnesota executive's request that the
men be brought back to Brown county
for trial.
The sheriff with his two prisoners, is
expected to arrive here either today or
tomorrow morning.
With four robberies in Brown county,
and the capture of all the men believed
to be connected therewith inside of a
month, the sheriff's office here feels that

In the state Hughes was slightly in the
lead, but the final official count will be
necessary to determine the actual re
sult. The state canvassing board does
not meet until November 28, but it has
been announced that the count as re
ceived from the various county auditors
will be carefully tabulated so the public
will not have to wait until that time to
know the result.
The Hennepin county soldiers on the
border gave Hughes a majority of 50,
The entire soldiers' vote gave Wilson
904 and Hughes 866, a majority of
thirty-eight for Wilson. The First and
Second regiments gave Wilson a majori
ty of only two votes, but the Third, the
members of which reside mostly in St.
Louis county, came across with a vote
of 177 for Wilson and 141 for Hughes,
giving the President the lead.
In the Electoral College, as the vote
indicates until the official count is taken
in all of the close states, gives President
Wilson 276, and Hughes 255. Should
the final count in Minnesota throw the
state to President Wilson he will have
288 in the Electoral College and Hughes
only 243.
NEW LUMBER AND COAL
YARDS FOR THIS CITY
New Ulm is to have a new lumber and
coal yard. The Farmers' Interstate Co
operative Company, which recently
purchased a yard at Searles, will enter
the field here, handling all kinds of
lumber and coal.
A tract of land for a site has been
purchased, a deal for the old Zellner
place at the corner of Center and Ger
man streets, having been closed. The
site comprises three lots and an ad
ditional twenty feet, for which it is said
$3,500 was paid.
John Nagel, who is to manage the new
concern, says it was expected to have
the buildings completed by the first of
the year, but owing to weather con
ditions the work would probably be
deferred until sometime in March.
The buildings to be erected will be
both lumber and coal sheds and a
suitable office building. The company
will probably be ready for business early
next spring.
