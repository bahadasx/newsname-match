The Work Has Just Begun
By a vote of l.SSS to 10,4 the peo-l
ii of Klamath Fall, yesterday voted i
to amend the city charter to permit
issuance of $300,000 bonds to belp
build the Oregon-California East
ern railroad. This proportion is al
most twelve to one.
The total vote of 1.316' Is close to
the registration la thl. city, and
shows the high Interest centered In
the election by everyone. When the
new. of the success of the bond Issue
was known last 'night excitement was
high. Even the Wlhonltes who were
celebrating at the pavilion .topped to
hear the new. and listen to ipeeches
by Robert E. Strahorn and other, on
the railroad situation.
By voting the bond, alnioit unani
mously, the people ot Klamath Fan.
have taken a stand for progrot. 4
development of thl. territory'.

WITH the voting of th 9800,000 bonds yestrrday, the work of e
curing a railroad for Klamath Falls lias in. reality just been fairly
started, "fills will probably provo one of the easiest of the ninny steps
nccefoary la the construction of the propose! i-oud. Their still remain
rights-of-way, terminal grounds and ninny other cllllk'iilt pi-oblems to bo
solved.
The vote of yesterday shon that the people of Klunuitli Falls are
overwhelmingly In favor of the railroad mid tluit they are gladly willing

farther than that tlie people want the railroad, and while , many of them
did not fairy understand Just how t ho money wus to be used, yet they
voted for the bomb on the Htrength of their confidence In the ublllty of
the City Council nnd the members of the committee J. V. Siemens, K.
R. Renmea nnd Mayor Crisler to prctct thefr iutcicts.
There will be n number of dlfllrult legal problems to Holve before
the money can be actually spent, and -the duty devolves upon the Council
and ntewibciB of the committee to see that definite contracts are entered
Into and -all necessary steps are taken to safeguard the interests or tho
city, before tho bonds nro even offered for .sale. It was generally under
stood that many of the plans and details could not be made public pre
vious, to the election, but the Herald will acquaint the people, from day
to day. with the progress of the work nnd the plans for the construction
