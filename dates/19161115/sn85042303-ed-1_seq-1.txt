cratic committee did not collect suf
ficient funds during the campaign to

will hesitate to make It personal and
try to help cover the deficiency. Hut
turn it around and figure it in this
way: Oklahoma has one-fiftieth of the
electoral vote of the United States.
One-fiftieth of the sum to be raised
is $6,000. That does not look so big
for the entire state. Now let's as
sume that Carter county is one-fiftieth
of the amount to be raised by the
whole state is IlL'u. That does not
look large for Carter county. Figure
It down further to the precinct and
If we raise about $3 to the precinct
our individual portion of the debt will
be cared for.
The Ardmorelte would like to be
the means through which enough
money Is raised in Carter county to
pay our pro rata part of the deficit.
We would like to go further and help
Jn all the counties surrounding us.
If each committeeman will get busy
he can raise his part in one day and
we can make good.
It matters not where you live, sit
down now and make out a small
check for this fund and send it to us.
The money will be properly accounted
for and sent immediately to headquar
ters. Since victory has come the com
mittee could very easily go and raise
this money If it were ro make com
promises for the party. But the dem
ocratic party has never raised Its
funds In that way. When it does do
so it ceases to be the party of the
people. Its funds have come from the
people in small amounts and every
man who loves the nation better than t
he loves any party, ought to rejoice
in this fact, rejoice that the party
will keep clean hands and be in posi
tion to deal fearlessly with every ques
tion that comes up before congress

these measures can seriously be dis

understood."
