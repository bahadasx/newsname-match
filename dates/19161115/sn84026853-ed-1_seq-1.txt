ABBEVILLE MEN j
STAND FIRM FOR i
UW AND ORDER,
I A mass meeting of the citizens of1
Abbeville Comity was held in the
court house Monday at noon, with
B. E. Hill, Esq., presiding, pursuant
to a call issued by the citizens of
Abbeville. About two hundred citizens
of the county were present and
a discussion of the recent disorders
in Abbeville County was had, looking
to a permanent settlement of the
v troubles in the county and to the
re-establish ment of the due administration
of the law. Speeches were
made by Dr. P. Y. Pressley, Dr. J.
S. Moffatt, Dr. 6. G. Parkinson, Dr.
J. W. Wideman, of Due West, Mr.
L A. Kellar, Hon. Wm. N. Graydon,
Mr. J. Allen Smith, Mr Posey Wham,
Sam Adams, Esq., J. V. Elgin and
William P. Greene.

was thoroughly diseased. The meeting
was largely composed of those
who favored the settlement of\all disputes
between citizens by dae process
of law and the judgment of
courts of competent jurisdiction.
There was some difference of opinion
as to what was best to be done under
all circumstances, but as stated, the
citizens generally, though differing
in methods, sought the same end, the
establishment of peace and law in
the county.
At the conclusion of the meeting
the resolutions adopted by the citizens
of Abbeville in mass meeting
last Tuesday, which were published I
in full in thfe paper last week, were
endorsed as carrying the sentiments
of the meeting, and a committee of j
twefve men, two of whom are to be
residents of Abbeville, two from the
towns of the county other than Abbeville,
and eight from the Rural
distric&are to be appointed by the
chairman of the meeting, who shall
hare for their duties the further*
ance of the ends sought by the
meeting, by taking up with the citizens
of the county the matters discussed
in the meeting, and endeavoring
to bring about a proper nnIder&jfcnding
between the people of
the cop^t^ and ^dup observance of
CPmODOW W4 i?SW4iA}fO ouu UIQ
members of' the committee -will *at
once take up with the citizens in the
different, parts of the . county the
matters entrusted to them, and it is
believed that little difficulty will be
encountered in having the people in
every community agree that disorders
should be kept down, and that
the laws should be enforced in accordance
with the dictates of humanity.

JOHNSON THE TAILOR
\ y?
R collection* of Former President's
v
( ( From the Greenville ilewB.)
A recent article in The New* dealt
-with the Laurens tailor who afterward
became President of the United
Stataa^ Andrew Johnson. It was;
learned in Laarens yesterday by a
visitor that much is yet remembered
A there about Lincoln's successor.
His tailor shop stood on tile public
square, facing the court house, and
just a few yards from; what is now
Governor Cooper's law office. Henry
Simpson of Laurens, has preserved in
good condition a coat which was
made by Johnson and manifests the
good quality of his workmanship. In
theBolt family is a quilt, one square
oflwhich was sewn in by him. With
[ .. Ids needle he wrote his autograph
there, thns proving the falsity of the
school histories which declare that
Johnson's wife taught him to read
and write, for he was not married until
long after he left Laurens. The
local conservators of history and tra..
dition are unanimous on the point
dtat Johnson was not illiterate at
that period.
The young woman of that city who
rejected Johnson's offer of marriage
was a Miss Word, who married a Mr
Hance, who was a Northerner by
birth and a saddler by profession. She
had a number of notes written her
by Johnson, perhaps expressive of his
tender sentiment for her, but it is
not known whether any of these still
exist. If thev do. they have hnrh
value on the autograph Inarket. It
is said that some time after the war
ex-Governor Perry delivered an address
in the Laurens court house in
which he referred somewhat critically
to the fact that Miss Word had rejected
Johnson and accepted a Yankee.
The story goes that Miss Word,
then Mrs. Hance, was very much incensed
at the utterance and vigorously
defended her decision, evidently
not at all regretting that she had

ture President Mrs. Hance has a

in the Crews, Bolt and other families.
We have been informed that the
tailor's goOse used by Johnson is still
in the possession of a Laurens family.

A PROTECTIVE TARIFF AND
ITS RELATION TO THE SOUTH
The Manufacturers Record, that
great journal, which has to its credit
as much, if not more, good work dohe
ior the South and its people than has
any other paper in the country, a
few months ago mistook the temperament
and desires, ag well as the prin
ciple of the Southern people, and
leaning far toward the manufactur
ers of the country, rather than for
the farming and laboring element of
the South, began a series of proselyting
articles in favor of a high protective
tariff, such as have aided in
keeping the Republican party In power
for so many years, to the enrichment
of the few and the almost starvation
of the mass of the/ American
people.
The wonder of it all is that the
Manufacturers Record found a number
of democratic papers in the South
in a way, indorsing its movement
Forgetting the great principle of the
party and the people they represented,
they condoned, even if they did
not openly indorse, many of the Manufacturers
Record's articles in favoz
of a protective tariff.?Austin (Te*.)
American.
As the Manufacturers Record has
for a little over a third of a century
been, as aggressively as it has known
how, advocating a protective tariff
for the benefit of the country, and
especially for the benefit?! the South
and as tite MannfartumnrjEterw^ is
not and never has beeir ? any sense
whatever a party or parti wan paper,
the Austin American seems to nave
been hard poshed for aome argument
ifits statements
Record o na protectee tariff were
that of a new convert, the American
would have been justified, hut since
its position is not a whit different
now from the policy which has prevailed
on this subject since the day
it. was established, and jus this fight
for a tariffwas made from the beginning
in behalf of the development of
the industrial .interests of the South
a? absolutely essential to the ^prosperity
of Southern- fanners, it has continued
to the present tnd expects to
4oatfnu? this samp line *f poUjcp. It
pie in the Sout^who were onee^freetraders
now ardent believers in protection.'
It has seen many papers in
the South recognize the importance
of protection to the South, though
hampered by political affiliations, and
at tames afraid to express their convictions
on the subject because of
party ties.
Southern < in sentiment, in origin
and in management, the Manufacturers
Record is through and through
in favor of a protective tariff, and
it is glad to say that a very large
proportion of the great leaders in industry
in the South and the men who
are bringing this section up out of
poverty to prosperity are heartily in
sympathy with it in favor of protection.
e : ^
Wherever industrial progress has
a.. J xl
creaiea mrivmg iuuusuuii wuiao
there is seen increasing' prosperity
for farmers.
The interest of the farmers of the
Smith in a protective tariff, which
will develop industrial interests, is as
great as that of any other class of
people. But the farmers of the
South do not represent all of the
people of this section.
The value " of the manufactured
products of the South now largely
exceeds thetotal value Of agricultural
products, and millions of people
are findiner emDlovment in industries
and inactivities which would never
have existed but for the industrial
development which has been made
possible under a protective tariff
through the development of the raw
materials and. the natural resources
of the South.
The Manufacturers Record has
been preaching this doctrine since
1882. It expects to keep on preaching
it so long as there is a single unconverted
free-trader who fails to
know the truth, with the hope that,
while the candle holds out to burn,
even the vilest free-trade sinner may
return.?Manufacturers Record.

PHENOMENAL STEEL EARNINGS i ' . |
-? v>#,3
The net earnings of the United /. ,
States Steel Corporation tot the
third quarter of this year amounted
to $85,817,067, as compared with
$38,710,644 in 1915 and $22,276,002
for the same quarter of 1914,
and allowing for interest and sinking ,
fund and dividends on the preferred
and common stock, including an ex- {
tra dividend of 1 per cent, on the
common, there was left for the last
quarter a net surplus of $51,859,450
These figures indicate the pehnomenal
prosperity in the steel trade, and
yet it is believed that the limit has
not yet been reached, but that the
present quarter will show still higher
earnings.
This prosperity is based upon Europe's
tremendous demand foj iron
ana steel and war munitions, ana our
people should fully understand the
situation in order to properly forecase
the future.?Manufacturers Record.
