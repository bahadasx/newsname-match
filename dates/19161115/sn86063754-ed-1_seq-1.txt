History of County; Attendance

and Orderly. I
The fourth annual Chester- 1
ft-IJ / > A. 1 U - A. .1 1
neiu v^oumv rair neia ai ine
county seat Wednesday, Thurs- 1
day and Friday of last week was ]
in many ways the best fair ever 1
held in the county. The weath '
er was ideal for the occasion, ^
save the dust, and the crowds ^
were made up of people from all
parts of the county and from ad |
joining counties. So far as this
writer saw the people were sober,
quiet and friendly. The carniv- ^
al atractions were up to the stan
dard for such, and few people '
left the fair grounds without *
havinc snent snmpthina fnr
amusement or entertainment. '
But the place of greatest interest '
to the thoughtful ones who at- ^
tended the fair for the purpose 1
of getting hold of new ideas was
the large brick building in which '
the most wonderful display of
agricultural products ever seen
in this section of the Carolinas
was housed. There the courteus
heads of each department stood
ready to ask and answer ques- 1
tions and give out any information
at hand in regard to the
many and varied exhibits.
The most noticeable features
_ A * - ? ? ?
oi me agricultural exiiiDits were ,
the ones by the three communi
ty fairs held in the county the 1
week before, Mt. Croghan, Mid- 1
dendorf and Macedonia, and the
individual farm-exhibits by F.
W. Rivers, G. L. Moore, D. T.
Watson and T. W. Gaskins.
The exhibits included every :
imaginable product of the farm,
a few of which were: Corn, cot- !
ton, sugar cane, rice, peas, vel
vet beans, soy beans, hay, pump
kins, watermelons, grapes, apples,
cotton seed, oats, wheat, 1
rye, vetch, clover, potatoes, and
- innumerable other objects. WJ.
Tiller had a large box of lux !
urantly growing clover, and one

wi ij v aiivi vti\.n. 11C U15U U'dU i\
box of sand illustrating the ear '
to-row method of testing seed
corn.
Either of the four individual
farm exhibits would have been
a small fair within itself. The 1
one bv Mr. Gaskins showed 115 \
different products of his farm,
and the others were probably
about the same. While the wri- 1
ter was looking at these someone
asked, "Why should a man
or his sons want to leave the
farm when all these things may
be grown there for the pleasure .
and profit of the farmer and his
family?" No good reason was
given there, and one will not be 1
given for there is not one.
The exhibits by the community
fairs contained entirely too
many products for detailed de- ]
scription here, but let it be said <
that these exhibits were magnificent,
and they reflected much <
credit to the communities from
whence they came and to the ]
promoters of the enterprises.
Mr. W. J. Odom was in charge ]
of the farm exhibits and he ex
plained that the cannon ball ex- J
hibited by Floyd Douglass was
the second ball fired at Fort <
Sumter at the beginning of the
Civil War- It looked to be about ]
six inches in diameter.
Mexican Big Boll cotton seed 1
were exhibited bv Mr. W. J.
Odom, who says he expects to I
fight the boll weevil with this
variety of cotton as it is very (
early, earlier than King's, and has
a staple of more than an inch. ]
Rust resisting cotton was exhibited
by Mr. W. M. Gainey. <

Floyd Douglass exhibited the
sifter used to sift sand to make
the mortar to build the old court
house at Chesterfield in 1779.
Mr. T. B. Smith exhibited velvet
beans and the first velvet
hean meal ever shown at a fair
in this county. It was ground
3n the new feed mill at Pageland
Novelty Works with the
hull on.
Mr. W. K. Sellers had on ex
hibition a bale of fine hay as

Fresh grapes were exhibited '
by W. J. Odom.
Mrs. Lee Griggs had on dis
play a quilt said to be 150 years
nld.
The Woman's Fancy Work
and Art department attracted
quite a bit of attention and
brought forth many favorable
comments. The Child's Department
was excellent also, and a
drawing by Miss Lealla Gaskins
and some tatting made by fiveyears
old Bessie Miller was worthy
of more than passing notice.
Mrs. D. M. Williams, of Patrick,
exhibited a number of
chrysanthemums said to be the finest
ever seen at Chesterfield.
The Eureka Canning Co. of
this county gave a demonstration
of what may be done with
the waste products of the farm.
This company is operating a
cannery at Montrose in the low
er part of the county. There is
a building 65x30 two stories high
in which are modern canning
machines capable of sealing
without solder or acid 70 cans a
minute. Potatoes, tomatoes,
beans, peas and other vegetables
are canned.
The live stock exhibits were
probably better than at previous
fairs in the county, but there is
still room for improvement in i
this line. Chesterfield county is
not surging forward in stock- t
raising as in some other lines,
but there is a gradual improve- ,
ment in the quality of the live
stock in the county. ,
The poultry industry in Chesterfield
county is not to be grin- ,
ned at. The chickens and other i
fowls at the county fair were
evidence enough that there are ,
many fanciers in the county i
who know how to raise good
fowls. Space forbids a detailed j
statement of the exhibits in live
stock and poultiy. (
It was not the privilege of the
writer to witness the arena t
events.
The list of prize winners is too ^
long to be published in full this
week, so a part of it will be held
until next week:

roops Sent As Sheriff Defies I
Governor Manning
Columbia, S. C., Nov. TO.?
lovernor Manning tonight or- t
ered five companies of Coast i
irtillerv to proceed to Anderson a
nmediately to afford civil au- 2
lority there to carrj- out orders f
f the court in ejecting striking t
till operatives of the Equinox r
lill from houses and in enforc c
ig the law. e
The Governor ordered Major c
/illiam F. Robertson, com
landing the battalion of Coast t
rtillery, to proceed to Ander- c
>n and take command. He al c
) telegraphed Commander s
rouch, of the four divisions of f
[aval Militia at Charleston, to g
old his companies in readiness c
answer a call. t
nib vjiLiaiwii ui me vjovernor c
send the National Guard into
nderson to preserve order f
id enable the civil authori- j
es to carry out the orders of f
le court came after all the civil t
rocesses had been exhausted. v
The militia companies at once t
sembled in their armories and c
? proceeding to Anderson, r
he Governor, ordered the necisary
railroad equipment made c
?dy. By daybreak tomorrow v
iO soldiers will be in Anderson o
ider command of Major Rob- s,
1son ready to carry out the n
xlers of the Governor. h
The trouble at Anderson be s
in some time ago, when con- a
ables who went to eject strikers h
om the houses on the mill d
opertv under ejectment orders b
om Magistrate Cox were stop- L
id by sympathetic crowds of tl
med strikers. h
JThe ejectment writs were then v
flced in Sheriff John H. M. si
shlev's hands, but the Govern- o
' receiveu an appeal from Man- si
jer Ligon, of the Equinox Mill, a
r protection, saying the sheriff y
tused to act. c<
The Governor wired the sher- b
to know of the situation and b
reply received a telegram ti
hich the Governor said was \>
nsolent." The sheriff in his is
ire to Governor Manning said p
said: d<
"Writs of ejectment have not li
:en served yet. I will do this sc
Drk according to my own
dgement and if that don't suit c<
?u, you can send up here and tc
F 11 JFUUI&CII. P'
Immediately the Governor re- fc
ied to him: "Your insolent
egram received. I shall with- b
it delay take necessary steps to ai
force the law in spite of your ci
itude of disrespect and defice
of the law and encourage- Ki
2nt of lawlessness."
In addition to the 250 National J.
jardsmen who are now pro
eding to Anderson there are f
0 more in the naval militia yX]
lich are being held under
ms to be sent there if needed. ai
lese units are all of the Nation- n,
Guard remaining in the State, a,
a rest being on duty along the
exican border. at

Sees Big Money in Sawdust w
mroe Enquirer. aj>
Some years ago a citizen of cc
2cklenburg county invented a lie
ntrivance for carrying cotton w
id away from water power pi
is and dumping them into the
;ek. The papers said that the m
/entor would put his machine ra
the market. It would not fl<
1 for much now when the in
ce of cotton seed is a dollar a hi
shel. We laugh at that Meek- he
tburg genius who made a de- trk
r
:e lor dumping cotton seed in- *
the creek. Yes, and in a few ,m
ars from now they will he
ighing at the people who are an
w carrying the sawdust away ly
m the mills and burning it. ex
me of these days folks will be
ling sawdust for as much as
Itoa brought yeflw ago, N?
-earn About the New Rural ,
Credits Law
Heretofore not enough attenion
has been given to the im- <
>ortance of adequate capital as i
i factor in successful farming,
dany a prudent and capable <
armer in the past has realized
hat his farm would be much i
nore profitable if he could tile ?
Irain his land; or if he could get j
:xtra horses and mules; or if lie i
:ould buy the animals needed to 1
snable him to engage more ex- ]
ensively in the dairying, swine,
>r beef cattle business; or if he <
:ould put up modern barns and ?
ilos. But he has lacked capital ;
or all these-things, and he could ]
ret capital only by taking ruin>us
risks. As Mr. E. W. Dabbs <
old the Farm Loan Board the i
>ther dav: ]
"I have never been able to <
arm as I wished nor as good <
udgement showed would be <
trolit iMp Kooonpr, r ??..u ?1 1
...U\.?.UUJC X LUUIU I1UI I
ake the risk ot a disaster that i
vould mean ruin under a svs- i
em where all debts must be paid
?ut of current profits or be car t
ied at a high rate of interest."
To all such men the coming t
>f the new rural credits law, (
vith its long-time loans at not t
iver 6 per cent, is a veritable f
odsend. As the Monroe Jourlal
puts it: "Here is a man who
as a farm in good shape, with t
lock and moderate equipment, r
nd is out of debt. Suppose that '
e wishes to increase the pro
uctivity of his land at once and
egin to get the benefit of it. t
,et him borrow five hundred, a r
lousand or two thousand dol- !
\rs, as the case may be, and in- t
est it in improvement of his
oil. Four crops of legumes-ldfr*
n the land, two winter and two t
Limmer crops, or two years in .
11, will more than double the
u -t __ - - - . s?
ieiu ui an acre ot land in this j
ounty. An acre that can now j!
e stimulated to produce a half- _
ale of cotton would, after such a
eatment, easily produce a bale ^
rith less fertilizer, and one that
; now producing a bale would
roduce two. Thus the cutting
own of labor expense by doubng
the soil fertility, would itself
)on pay the loan." a
Farmers everywhere should v
ertainly inform themselves as
> the provision of a law that r
romises such relief, and this inirmation,
like salvation, is free.
Simply write the Federal Farm 11
oan Board. Washington n c tl
id ask for copies of its free cir v
liars, especially Circular No. 5, s<
Hie Farm Loan Primer."?Pro l'

\ German Sub. Sank Ametlcar.
Steamer Nov. 8
Paris, Nov. 12.?A wireless
dispatch from Madrid says that
it was a German submarine
which sunk the American steamship
Columbian.
According to this information
ihe Columbian encountered the
submarine on November 6, during
a violent tempest. The submarine
compelled the Columbian
to interrupt her voyage and
lie to under surveillance until
November 8. Wnen the storm
subsided, the dispatch says, the
submarine ordered the crew to
abandon the ship and then sank
tier.
A I lavas dispatch from Madrid
luotes the newspapers ot Corunla,
Spain, where the crew is reported
to have landed, to the
effect that when the Columbian
was held up the submarine
ordered the crew to disembark
tiut that the storm was so severe
.hat this was impossible until
[wo days later.
The dispatch also says that
he Norwegian steamships Balto
ind Fordalen were destroyed in
he same manner on November
) (a report of the sinking of
hese steamships was received
rom London last night.)
