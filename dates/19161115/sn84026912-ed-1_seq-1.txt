Federal Proceeding* Nearing End in
a Number of Oconee Cases.
Col. A. A. Manning was in Green
wood last week in attendance upon
the United States District Court in
connection with the Oconee county
cases in which the government is ac
quiring mountain land.
Verdicts, fixing the value of the
land, were taken in tho cases affect
ing land offered by the following
persoBs: , Mrs. L. C. Swafford, Lu
cinda S wa fiord and Lassie Turpin,
W. G. Uussell, J. W. Smith, J. S. Car
tor, Silas Butt, J. H. Cannon, P. J.
Carter, A. Morrison, Geo. S. Watkins,
Jeff Svafford.
There is very good ground for
thinking that, unless some new pa
pors have been recorded since the re
ports made on the titles, and unless
the tates have not been paid, the
money will shortly be paid into the
Registry of the U. S. District Court
in the cases affecting the lands of
fered by the following jtersons:
J. K. Gaines, J. C. Powell, J. P.
McCall^ W. B. Doyle, J. H. Barnett,

Threshing Machine Co., J. D. Vernor,
J. H. Long, M. H. Lee, W. T. Burton,

This means that in all probability
a little over $14,000 will shortly be
paid into court, and that all persons
wishing to establish a claim to tho
money therefor, unless thoy have al
ready done so, must file their claims
for the money in tho U. S. District
Court at Greenville within ton days
from the date of its deposit, or be
forover barred.

ing at the Star Gosoel Mission some
three weekB ago 1 was stricken with
appendicitis and went to the hospi

on the following Tuesday. (This
was Sunday night.) And my family
came down, and Mrs. Burnett WBB
ill at the time. We put off my ope
ration for a few days for her to get
better. 1 also improved Borne and
have not had the operation yet, but
the doctor told me to-day that since
I was getting some woree again that
I would have to have it at once, as I
would be taking a great risk. The
probabilities are that MrB. Burnett
and myself both will have to have an
operation. So I ask the readers of
The Advocate with all others to pray
for us. J. O. Burnett."
