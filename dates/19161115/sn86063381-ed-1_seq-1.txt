By B. M. GILE
(Bemidji School Agriculturist)
TO every one who observes the
trend of affairs on the farms) in the
Bemidji country, the increase in the
number of farms where sheep are
kept is noticeable. A sheep raiser is
seldom found who is not enthusiastic
over the profit from this class of live
stock Sheep are also a great help
in clearing up the farm and in in
creasing the fertility of the soil.
Sheep are often called the "Golden
Roof" because they never Impover
ish the land upon which they tread.
Sheep manure la worth more per ton
than any other class of manure ex
cept that of chicken and it is always
spread evenly over the land Some
one has said that no spreader has yet
been invented that does such perfect
work as the sheep themselves*.
Sheep are Profitable.
Exhibits Being Received
For Bemidji Crop Show
To be Held December 7-8-9
Sheep are one of the most profit
able classes of livestock The factors
which make this true are not hard
to find In the first place thev re
quire less labor than any other class
of farm animals At lambing time,
which is the Shepherd's harvest, the
successful .sheep raiser must be pre
pared to give them considerable time,
but in the busy haying and harvest
time all that it is necessary to do is
to see that plenty of pure water and
salt is available and to count then
occasionally to see that none of th^m
are in trouble Secondl less expen
sive buildings are required. If sheep
have a place that is dry and out ot
the wind, they will not suffer with
the cold Sheep require less outlav
of capital The price of eight good
Many Farmers Expected to
Attend Farmers1
Many farmers are expected to at
tend the Farmers' Institute which
will be held at the high school build
ing in Bemidji Saturday, Dec 9. The
Corn, Potato and Poultry show will
be held on the same day.
In previous years this institute has
been held about the first of Novem
ber. This year it wad thought that
it would be a good idea to extend
the crop show which is held Dec. 7
and 8 in connection with the annual
meeting of the N. M. D. A. over to
the ninth and hold the institute on
that day.
Last summer the merchants of Be
midji were invited to a big dinner
given by the farmers at the fair
grounds. On Dec. ninth, the Bemidji
Merchants' association will try to
some of its appreciation by fur
nishing a good warm dinner to ev
eryone who attends the farmers'
meeting. Thid dinner will be pre-
MINNESOTA HAS
MONEY TO LOAN

St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 15.Minne-
sota will have money to loan the first

With the shortage of money re
ported early this year the board quit
receiving applications for loans from
ffcmool districts and municipalities.
Now figures show that the board
will have 1103,000, Dec. 1, and ex
pects to have st^ morejbefore the
first of the year.
class seed show Premiums are of
fered on corn, potatoes and poultry.
One object of this show is to fur
nish a place where anyone interested
in corn, potatoes and poultry may
come and see what the right types
are Farmers can only improve*by
Selection and potatoes especially de
teriorate rapidly unless the best is
saved for seed each year.
The judges of each class will re
main on hand during the entire week
and visitors are invited to find why
one sample of potatoes and corn or
one pen of poultry took first prize
and another second.
Banks Give Prizes.
The local potato and corn contest
among the boys and girls will be de
cided at the time of the show. Each
contestant in the potato contest will
have a peck of seed on exhibit and
each contestant in the corn contest
will have twenty ears of corn on dis
play. The Northern National bank,
through W. L/Brooks, is offering the
first two prizes on the potatoes an
the Security State bank, through
C. Baer, cashier, is offering two first
prizes on corn.
Anyone desiring a copy of the
premium list may get one or more
copies if desired from B. M. Glle,
Bemidji school agriculturist, who is
secretary of the show.
Sheep Raising Profitable
Bemidji is Central Point
ForGood Pure BredStocktrencsector
sheep at present is about equal to
the price of one good cow. With the
present good prices for wool, the
fleece will pay for the maintenance
of breeding ewe and she will raise
one, two or three lambs, which with
the high prices* for meat makes a
good net profit for the owner Mr.
Clark, of the Clark Pole & Tie com
pany, is authority for the statement
that we will never see cheap meat
again This, together with the great
shortage of wool caused by waste |n
the European war, will undoubtedly
make the wool and mutton business
good for years to come.
Get Pure Bred Sheep.
From what has been said, it is not
intended to give the impression that
it would be wise to give up the-dairy
cow and stock up with sheep, but
rather to show that a great many
more farmers might profitably keep
a few sheep E. E. Schulke of Ten
strike has a good flock of sheep Mr
Schulke says that they are the most
profitable class of stock he has on
his farm Other prominent sheep
raisers around Bemidji are Lawrence
Steinbrook. Frank Silversack, August
Jarchow, Peter Narum and Fred
Dudley The Moore, Burke and Traf
ton farm recently purchased four
pure bred Shropshire ewes and two
Shropshire rams The production of
good breeding stock will be of great
benefit to sheep in this community
and it ought to be a profitable un
dertaking for those concerned for the
reason that people for a hundred
miles in every direction are looking
toward Bemidji as a central point
where they may send and got good
pure bred stock

domestic science department of the
high school under the able supervi
sion of Miss Antoinette Olson.
The program will bear a close re
lation to the crop show. The first
prize samples will be used to show
what can be done by selection.
The entire country has ifcy eyes
on Northern Minnesota as a source
for seed potatoes. George Miller,
"The Potato King," will probably
make a few remarks on potatoes.
The entire program will be an
nounced next week.
A. L. Molarider of the Minneap
olis, Red Lake & Manitoba railway
has agreed to provide a way for peo
ple living along the Red Lake line
to leave Bemidji about 9 p. m. for
their homes. This will enable them
to attend the institute, do whatever
trading they wish and attend the
first picture show before returning
home. ONE KILLED: THREE INJURED

ELECTION OVER
INQUEST ISN'T
VERDICTAWAITED
(By United Press)
New York, Nov 15The election's
over, but the inquest isn't. Vance
McCormick has lost interest in the
coroner's verdict and gone home,
leaving William Willcox to sit up
with the body and hear the evidence,
if he wants to.
One brilliant New York reporter
today is still smarting from the
Democratic chairman's comeback to
his prepature inquisitiveness
"What," asked the reporter, "do
you expect to get now that Wilson
has won the victory'"
"A great deal," said McCormick*
"of sleep
It is a question whether Chairman
Willcox will get even that for days
and days*.
Old John W Gloom, who ran him
self how-legged all week, trying to
decide which of the two chairmen to
stay with, was stretched out all over
the Willcox sanctum today. The only
cheerful thing about Republican
headquarters is the decoration. No
body has troubled to efface the pic
ture of Uncle Sam lifting the old flag
out ot the dust for Hughes, They
have even suffered to remain un
touched the merry quip:
"Elect Bill Jones for sheriff! He
kept us out of Jail!
As for Democratic national head
quarters with its &aff of 300 and
Its office building full of mahogany
furniture, nothing remained but an
air of victory. The last vestige of
Democratic doubt as to Wilson*s ?to
tory has vanished and the great
rooms are as empty as a ditch dig
ger's stomach at 6 p. m.
