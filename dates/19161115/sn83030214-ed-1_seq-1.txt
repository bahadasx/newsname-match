"DOMESTIC AFFAIR"
"Long. Bitter Struggle
Ahead," He Declares, "We
Must Use Every Defence"
[Fr?>ra Th* Trlbuna F'rrean '
Washington, Nov. M.- Great Brit?
ain'* reply to the Ameriran protest
against the blacklist, made pnblic by
the State Department to-night, rejects
politelv hut firmly the demand that
the ban he lifted. The legal argtiment
set forth in support of t.hin stand is
admitted privately by officials to be
flawles*.
Thp note declare* tha' the m?a*ure
is purely domestic !egi>lation. that it
cnncerns onlv British citi.en?, and that
it is designed to shorten the wBr. Vis?
count Grey declare.* that (ierman
houses ubroad have aeted ss psrt of the
military organization of Germany.
Such firms, he declare.*. have been
boses of supply for German cruisers,
pavmasters of bomb plotters, etc. Such
activities, he points out, have heen car?
ried on in the United States, and "no
adequate action has yet been taken by
thc government of the United States to
suppress breaches of neutrality of this
particularly criminal kind, which I
know that they (tka United States) are
the first to discountenance and de
plore."
It can be stated authoritatively that
as a result of this legal defence "he
j I'nited States will abandon its original
J contention that the blacklist is * vio?
lation of international law. A new
proteat will be made, but it will be
: based on the arirument that the hlaek
! list methods constitute a serious breach
I of international comity. Thc objection
; which officials noW ur_e is not that
1 the measures in themselves are illegal,
'. but. that thev are administered in such
; a way as to be needlessly vcxatiojs to
neutrals.
The new Ameriean position, which
will be antllaad in a forthroming note
to Great Britain. is base_ on the indi
! rect effects of the blacklist meaaures
and the methods used in administering
them.
Couldn't Get Bank Loans
Officials declare that blacklisted
firms have suffered even in domestic
; trade, bocBuse all Amencan and neutral
! firms having valuable relations with
I Allied countrie.i fear to acquirs a
"taint" by draling with those on the
11st. In some cases th?>y have even
been refitsed ordinary banking facili
ties in this country. This. Great Brit?
ain insista, is not the intention, but
the State Department believes it is
unavoidable by the very nature of the
blacklist system.
He*id.s this. the British authoritie*
in ndministering the blaekl**t have
mide many extremely vexatiou* mis
takaa, through whirh innocent firms
have for long period* been deprived of
trade farilities.
A part of the note whirh attrarted
much official notice dealt with the
subject of peace, based on the theory
tlint one Ameriean contention had been
that there exists no militarv necessity
for the blacklist, that it is unneeessary
for the Allies to prejudiee neutral
commerce, and that nothing which hap?
pens in neutral countries can influence
the result of the great conflirt.
I.ong, Bitter Struggle Ahead
"If that really were the position,"
says th** note, "it i* possible that the
measures taken bv his ma.iesty's gov
ernnunt might be daacribed is uncalled
for, but. it is not. We may well wish
that it were so
"Kvin though the militarv situation
of tho Ailiaa has flraatlji iamoraa,
there i* still a long and bitter struggle
in front of them, and one which tn
justice to the principles for which they
are fighting miposes upon them the
duty of eniployitig every opportunity
and every measure which they can
legitimntely use to overeome their op
ponents.
"iine observation which is verv coni
monly heard is that certain belligerent
acts, even though lawful, are too petty
to have any influence'in a struggle of
such magnitude.
"It is, I know. difficult for those who
have no immediate contact with war to
realize with what painful nnxiety men
and wonu-n in this country must regard
eran the aaaallaat acts which tend to
increase. if onlv by a hair's breadth,
the danger in which their relative* and
friends daily stand. or to prolong, if
onlv by a minute, the period during
wfcick they are to be exposcd to such
perils.

In its argument, the r.ote points out

London, Nov. 14 The battle of the

? official statement. to-day. udmitting the
loss of Reaumont-Famcl and Divion.
; And the sanguinary struggle continue*,
j with the defendcrs paying ? heavier
I price than Haig's troops.
The British are battering their way
i steadily toward Miraurnont. The capt
' ure of Beaucourt gives them a positto'i
' on which they can pivot their flank to
i the north and sweep beyond the Beau
, mont-Serre line to pocket Miraurnont,
an important railway station.
Two important results already have
accrued from this new offensive. Ger
I man defences of surpassing strength
have heen smashed and u large number
of prisoners has been taken. The Brit?
ish haul of prisoners exreeds the best
of any previous two days in the Somme
; fighting. Addlng casualties the German
j losses in yesterH;i\V grappla probably
equal two divisions.
There is no sign of ahatement in *he
i fury of the struggle. The British guns
' continue to pour forth a deluge of shell
on the German second line and the in
, fantry advances as soon as a path has
heen cleared. Stiff tighting atill re

attended the fighting of the first two
da-. * of the drive induces confidence of

Haig's Reports Are Brief
When the historians write of the hat
1 tie of the Ancre they are certain to rfl
fer to the laconic messages of Sir
Douglas Haig, who has used just a lit?
tle more than 200 words to tell th?
story of the first forty-eight hours of
1 fighting as desperate and as hrilliant a-;
the British have met in the whole war.
1 Only now is the public beginning to
appreciate the significance, and the size
of the battle raging north and south
I of the brook. Its centre has been
! Beaumont and Beaucourt, but these
! have fallen, and it is shifting eait
! 4t ard.
The columns on both sides of the
! Ancre are moving forward in unison,
. for lf one lags tne other ennnot ad
\ vanre. The preclsion with whirh the
! two movements were coordinated and
the almost perfect cooperation of the
jrunners were the ke> notes of the first
day's suceess.
In their annnuncenients the British
are extremely cautiou*; they are elann
ing nothing which they are not abso
lutelv sure of holdlng. Thus. while
unofficial dispatches from the front
told yesterday of the capture of Beau?
mont, Haig did not make that claim

DEPORTATION
OF BEGIANS
Tells Germany She Is
Defying Humanity

BAD EFFECT ON
NEUTRAL OPINION
Charge at Berlin Instruct
ed to Deal Directly

Washington, Nov. 14.?The Unit*4
.States has entered a vigorous pro
ttat with the German government
against the wholesale deportation of
Belgians from thair country.
The government has learned tha*.
in many instanccs these non-com?
batants are forced to dig trenches
and do other military work for their
enemies. The Belgian government
has announced ita intention to appeal
to the neutral world that her citizens
are being led into praetieal slavery.
So serious has the German move
become that American Charge Grew
at Berlin has been instructed to taka
the matter up personally with Chan?
cellor von Bethrrrann-Hollweg.
In Mefianre of Humanity
The Charge has been directed to
tell tha Chancellor that the German
measures ara in defiance of humanity
and international law, and are pro?
ducing a most unfortunate effect on
neutral opinion. This is particularlj
true in the United States, he was
instructed to say, as the welfare of
the Belgian civilian population is
largely in the care of Americans and
tha American people are therefore
deeply concerned.
The instructions, it was learncl
to-day, grew out of a long report
from Charge Grew in which he
etated that. he had ditwaf aed the flitti
ation informally and unofficially with
Herr Zimmerman, Under Secretary
of Foreign Affairs. The latter ad?
mitted that a definite policy had been
adopted to en force the labor of Bel
gians in cases where they would not
work voluntarily, on the ground that
so many refused to work as to mako
the strain on public charity intoler
able.
Violation of Pledges
The deportations are viewed here not
only as a violation of international law,
but in a degree as a violation of Gcr
j many's assurances to Ambassador Ger
I ard last June. which, though relatlng
I to the 20,000 Freneh women and girlfl
, deported from Lille, Roubalx and
| Tourcolng, are felt to he applicable to
i the Belgian situation. At that time,
j when Mr. Gerard had gono to General
? Headquartera in France to diflcusa the
attaek on the Suflsex with Kmperor
William, all the American relief work
\ ers in Northern France were called into
conference and assurances given B) '?"?
Germans that no further deportations
would be made. The case fli the Bel?
gians is considered identical in prin?
ciple.
Reports from Rome, that the i'nited
States has joined ot will join the Vati
! can. ?pain or the Netherlanda, ln a
joint protest are declared tintru*. tn
this question as ln the many others
f that have arisen during the war, tkfl
i United States will act independently.
The deportationa ftre regarded by
some officials here as an attempt to
release ('erman workers for the flnnf
line by replacing them with Belgians.
More than any other one thing, this
is expected to increase the bitterness
I of the Allies toward Germany and
1 their desire for peace through a erush
1 mg vietory. Foreign Ministers Be>ens
, and Cardinal Mercier. of Belgium. hav
: issued public appeals to the neutral
! nations to effect a cessatlon of the
deportations, England also is dee,dy
; concerned.
Reports Weat mmWka
Reports afl to the deportation* vary
in detail but not in principle Thotfl
who go to Germany voluntarily ara
made to sign a general free-will con?
traet. under which thev are afliured
good food, a salarv, guarantee of care
for their families and freedom of cor
respondence with them. Those refus
ing to sign are said to be coerred
where possible through imprtsonment.
, If this is unsuecesiful in obtaining
their signature the labor is compulsorv
at 80 pfennigs a day. without provision
| for families or permission to corr*
I spond.
The deportations assumed their moat
systematic form when, on October 10,
the German Governor General was re
\ ported to have requested the pre?i
, dents of the ("omitefl Nationale de 9**
couri, under penalty of imprnonment,
1 to furnish lists of all Relgtans receiv
; ing aid. Many of the presidents re
! fused and were at once put in jail. On
the baaifl of tha lists that were ob?
tained, however, drafts were begun at
' once. No accurate information has
! been received either as to how manv
| have been deported or where. Th?
. work to which they have been sent >s
' deaignated aa "industrial."
Privately, officials deapair of obtain.
