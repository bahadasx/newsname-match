Letter from Ralph
Describing Camp
Life.
23, 1916
Llano Grande, Texas, Oct
Dear Father-
I received your letter written the
19th to-day, also the other two let
ters last week I got the box of
pins and thread and needles that
mamma fixed up This is quite a
novelty and will come very handy,
I wish to thank her verv much for it.
I was surprised to heai that you had
snow up there as early as this but
it probably won't stav on the ground
very long. I like it better heie
every day. I have got an easy job
liere now They detailed Davis and
I on a ration wagon for 30 days
We go to the bakery eveiy morning
and get half a wagon load of bread
for all the batteries our regiment.
There aie six field bakeries and they
bake an average of 10,000 loaves
of bread a day to supply this entire
camp. We haul all the expiess and
freight for our regiment too. We
don't have to drill at all and don't
have any horses to take care of. We
never have to stand guard either.
Davis is proving to be a fine fel
low. Yesterday we hiked over to
Donna, six miles west of here. It
was a fine day, we got pretty warm
by the time we got there but it gave
us a good appetite for dinner. We
"went into a resturant and had a
good square Sunday dinner, pork
roast, mashed potatoes, and a lot of
side dishes of vegetables, coffee and
apple pie a la mode. I can eat any
kind of vegetables now. We have a
vegetable here called okre, it looks
a little like parsnips, they are real
eheap and taste a good deal like
\oysters when fried. They feed them
"to us in soups in camp. All the
Testaurants down here are frame
shacks with big screened porches. Pray[n8
This Donna town is about as big asDon't
Argyle and half the population are
Mexicans. Every house almost has
Oleander plants growing in their
yards with white blossoms, they are
all in bloom at this time of the
year. We saw some banana trees
SO feet high, they are queer looking
trees, they have leaves six feet long

didn't get paid, they tore down one
i j3 the officers tents and then went to
l^r Tipperary and burned up a saloon,
!j they put the whole regiment under
J%V arrest for a few days. A regiment
f-TNJl New York cavalry passed thru
JU iLhere last Friday bound for Browns-
HI ville, they strung out double file for
|t4*" -over a mile, a thousand men on a
thousand horses. We had a division
al hike here today, our battery took
part. The parade consisted of three
regiments Minn. Infantry, three reg
iments Ind. Infantry, five regiments
Neb. Infantry, two Machine Gun
companies, one regiment of Minn,
artillery, one regiment of Ind artil
lery, one regiment of Iowa cavalry,
four troops of Oklahoma cavalry,
one regiment of Lousiana artillery,
three companies of Indiana engin
eers. It took them about an hour
and a half to pass a given point. It
-^\was some sight to see big U. S.
flags waving in the wind and bands
playing rag time airs. They went
to Mercedes and back. They strung
out about five miles in length. The
front of the parade was nearly back
liere by the time the last ones were
leaving. I wish you could have seen
it. We had a call to arms one night
last week, everybody gets up and
forms in line in front of the quarter
masters tent with his belt and what
ever clothes he has handy. A civil
ian who runs a laundry just outside
of camp about a half a mile had
been fired on by Mexicans, he came
running down our battery street fir
ing his gun. He said the Mexicans
-were chasing him. We sent a dozen
of our guards back with him but
they didn't see any signs of Mexi
tcans. The biggest joke of the whole
fining was that none of our guards
3iad any shells in their guns. The
The" bananas are" green yet, but theJ took the form of an oyster supper

The oranges will be ripe about
Christmas time altho this is not
mueh of an orange country, we saw
a few orchards. We helped a Ford
jitney driver fix his car between
here and there. Ninety-nine out of
a* hundred cars in this country are
Tords or Packards army trucks.
Xots of the officers drive Fords and
dozens of Ford jitneys operate be
tween Llano Grande to Mercedes,
'Tipperaiy, Donna, Midway and the
lake. We saw about a dozen flocks
of geese yesterday and I bet there
-were at least 200 geese in each flock.
"They were flying* low and some cav
alrymen shot at them but didn't hit
any. They seemed to be headed for
the lower end of our lake, south of
Llano Grande. We had a Texas
Ttforther here last Saturday morning,
it was a cool north wind, there was
Ho frost of course but it made the
-fire feel good at 5 o'clock Saturday
morning. W are not geeting up
liniil six o'clock now. We got paid
last Thursday, some of the boys
liave not showed up since then. You
ought to see the way they sell pop,
Ice eream, cigaretts and candy at
the canteens here. It keeps six menmeeting.
Jumping side ways to wait on them.
Tlfy canteen bills were about $8.00
last month. There are three can
teens that we can get credit in, we
can also get show tickets there to.
The second Indiana regiment went
$ on a rumpage last week because they
VARREN
seargent of the guard had neglected
to give them any. I had shells in
my gun the last time I was on guard
but I was guarding the picket* ,iine,
where the horses were. The J$gxi
cans have been stealing horses joff
the picket lines once in a while
One fellow was shot in th, arm
guarding the same post I had out it
was before we came down here
Our mess halls and kitchen^. are
nearly finished. We have set 6ut
palms along our battery street, we
have a palm six feet high on each
side of the door of our tent. We
dug them up out in the woods We
have been issued woolen clothes in
cluding overcoats and it look? very
much like we would go home befoie
Christmas I would just as s^on
stay clown here all winter Mosquito
netting comes in handy here Vat
night. Everyone has to use it over
their bunks Well, it is time to go
to bed, 9 30, so I will close dior this
time The Sheaf always comes on
Tuesday.
Regards to all,'
Ralph.
P. S. This camp has been con
demned and there is some !talk of
our moving up to Corpus Christi for
the winter but I don't take much
stock in it We will go to Point
Isabel for target practice in a couple
of weeks and then home I think.

The Warren Associated Schools.
Anyone visiting the five schools
associated with the Warren schools,
will find much to commend in each.
In the first place, each teacher there
in is showing a keen interest in thewhich
work of the school and is trying to
make it of benefit to the entire com
munity.
The buildings themselves have
been cleaned and in some cases
painted and thoroughly repaired
within.
The Burnside school house is this
week undergoing a thoro and much
needed course of renovation and
seats suitable to the size of the
children are being put into the build
ing.
The patrons believe that the room
where the children spend so much of
their time from the age of 6 to
16Turner,
years should be made as comfortable
and as beautiful as possible.
It is little less than criminal to
allow a child to sit in a seat where
feet must dangle in the air with
out support for six hours each day.
Nothing could be more conducive to
curvature of the spine, round should
ers and the resulting cramped chest
capacity. It is just as incumbent
upon school officers and teachers to
look after the physical as it is the
intellectual welfare of the child.
In visiting these schools, we have
been pleased to note the systematic
and orderly manner in which the
children pass to and from the school
room.
Three of these schools have had
basket socials and the money thus
raised is being used to get some
thing useful for the school.
Miss Mabel Carney, state inspect
of the high school Normal depart
ment, is visiting some of these
schools this week.

A reception was given at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. John P. Mattson on
Wednesday afternoon and evening
in honor of Miss Julia Swanson,
the new superintendent of the War

duties two weeks ago In view of
the fact that circumstances, over
Miss Swanson had no control,
had so shaped themselves that it
became necessary for her to leave
her work here, the reception was in
the nature of both a welcome and a
farewell. About one hundred women
and men of the city were present
to show Miss Swanson their good
will and esteem and to express their
regrets at her leaving so soon.
Luncheon was served. Miss Swanson
will leave for Minneapolis this eve
