HARDY'S GLEANINGS.
Large Crowd Attends Fair in
Augusta. Cemetery Hill
School Attend on Chil
dren's Day.
We are still having lovely weath
er, although we need rain very bad
ly.
There was a fine rain in Augusta |
on Saturday while we were there,
aad we were hoping that there was
just as much at home, but found
when we arrived, that there had
only been a mist, scarcely enough
to settle the dust.
We saw a good many of the
country folks while in Augusta on
Saturday. Mr. and Mrs. H. F.
Cooper and family with the sweet]
little teacher, Miss Birma Barker,
Mrs. Ernest Cogburn, Mrs. Wyly
Glover, Mr. and Mrs. Sam Gardner,
Jr., Mrs. James McClarn and Miss
Mary Townes, down from her
school at Red Hil!, Mr. Herbart
Bunch and sitter, Mr. and Mrs.
Harry Bunch.
Mr. Frank Townes carried down
some hogs to enter at the Georgia
Carolina fair.
Mr. Herbert Bunch found several
of the Club members at work ar

Theresa Bunch, Miss Mary McKie,
Mr. George MoKie, Mrs. Hugh
Scott, Jr., Mr. Milton Barker, Mr.
Fred Barker, Mr. Charlie Burkhal
Iter, Mr. and Mrs. Cooper and sev
[eral others. We could not get there
I at all to help any, but sent what we
?could to help out and hope they may
win first prize.
If the weather continues pleasant,
I no doubt the attendance will be
I good this season.
Trustee, Harry Bunch, and ,Mrs.
j^Barich, the teacher, expeot to take
? two horse' wag?ra load of the/Cem
etary Hill school children down for
ohildren's Day at the fair. We
know the little folks will enjoy
themselves, for some of them have
never attended a fair. But my! we
are so glad we will not have to keep
up with that many children in a
crowd like that will be.
The autos have been spinning
past here like June bugs all this
pretty weather, and if it continues
this week they will be as thick ai
honey bees going to the fair.
We were glad to hear Mr. In
gram say that his baby is almos)

The judges decided in favor of the

Directly after the meeting of the
I literary society, an exciting game of
basket-ball was played between
the graded and high-school. The
graded school team is practically as
good as the high school as shown
by the score which was 10 to 10.
Ethel Ch?atham, three the greatest
number of goals on either side.
On last Wednesday morning the
chapel exercises were made ex
tremely entertaining by a short pro
gram for the first and advanced
first grades. Two model reading
lessons, an exercise entitled "The
Little Red Hen," two songs and
several recitations were the features
of this very interesting program,
and we extend the very bes: of con
gratulations to the members of this
grade.
We were glad to have De Witt
Turner from the Harmony section
enter our high school on Monday
morning. Mr. Turner entered the
eighth grade and exhibits qualities
of a good student.

The Colored Fair a Success.
The colored fair which was held
here at the fair grounds Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday of last
week was a distinct success from
every standpoint. There were a
large number of highly creditable
exhibits in every department. The
exhibits in the agricultural build
ing were well displayed and pre
sented a scene that reflected credit
on the race. The entries in tbt
livestock and poultry departments
were numerous and of a high order
Another thing to the credit ol
the negro race was the splendid or
der that prevailed all three day!
and also at night upon the grounds
Notwithstanding the fact that th?
attendance mounted up into tlx
thousands there was no disturbanci
or disorder of any kind. The ver
excellent manner in which thos<
who attended the fair deporte?
themselves was a credit to the col
ored race as much as were thi
exhibits
Those who had the responsibility
of managing the colored fairdeserv
credit. Ail details were carefull,
looked after and all financial obi
g?tions have been promptly mei
Considering the fact that thes
managers had no previous exper
euee, the success which they <nad
of the undertaking is all the mor
remarkable. We believe that th
colored people expect to hold ai
other fair next fall, and the succei
which they made this year wi
make their next fair less difficult.

RED OAK GROVE
Missionary Society and Y. W. A.
Active. New Homes Estab
lished. Good Words
for County Fair.
A large congregation greeted oar
pastor at Red Oak Grove last first
Sunday. We had quite a number
of visitors. Among them were Mrs.
Mary Burton from Gilgal. She
was cordially greeted by her friends
and all appreciated having her at
tend our services.
The W. M. S. held their business
meeting yesterday. Collections
were real good, nearly five dollars
being raised for Dr. Derieux for
a building at Rock Hill. Don't re
member exactly the collection for
the Hospital. We are also getting
up a shipment for the Orphanage at
Greenwood, several of the ladies
are giving i and working up this
method with encouragement.
It was made plain why our Socie
ty was not given credit for contri
butions of mattresses to Edisto
Academy, being Red Hill instead
of Red Oak Grove. The mistake
was no fault of our secretary.
Mrs. Eugene Thurmond, Jr., has
charge of our Y. W. A's. now, and
we feel sure they will do well. They
are a willing band of sweet, pretty
girls,and all they needed was a good
and regular leader. We antici
pate good work for them. They
meet next Sunday afternoon with
Misses Maggie and Ciena Agner.
Oui school is arranging for an
oyster supper on Friday after
Thanksgiving, which is December
1st. We feel sure that the mena
that will be served to those that
night, who do not care for oysters
will be sufficient to pleaee the most
fastidious, and we solicit a good pa
tronage, endeavoring to make the
evening one of real pleasure, besides
raising funds which are for the ben
efit of our school.
Mias-Lbzie-Mae Holstein ci.
doc, is our assi??ant^wHom we
sure will be quite au accession to
our community also.
Mr. Press Doolittle is entertain
ing now with lullabys, as grand
son J. P. is his guest.
Mr. and Mrs. James Hamilton
will move back among us, occupy
ing the Prince home where Mrs.
Hamilton wa3 raised. Also, anoth
er home is being established in our
midst. Mr. Billy Doolittle, one of
the hard working, industrious young
men, is building near Flat Rock
school house.
We are in love with the splendid
town of Greenwood, but hav'nt a
Single girl for its adoption. Orange
blossoms are indicated aud we are
suspicious.
Our entire community was sad-'
dened on hearing of the sudden
death of Mr. W. H. Turnei. He
had many friends here who shall
miss him. Our hearts go out in
sympathy for the bereaved family.
Mr. Turner has left us a rich in
heritance, a good influence.
We hear such good things for the
fair. We are always encouraged to
hear good news from a county fair,
for it shows a spirit of progress and
cooperation, both of which we need
to succeed. There's nothing like
success.
A Merciless Judge.
One Who Shows No Favors
A merciless judge is Father Time
Before him the weak and the want
ing go to the wall. Only the truth
can stand. For years the following
statement from an Edgefield resi
dent has withstood this sternest of
all tests.
Mrs. K. L. Lowe, Cedar Row,
Edgefield, says: "My back had
bothered me for months and I be
came weak and all run down. From
other symptoms, I knew that my
kidneys were at fault. Doan's Kid"
ney Pills gave me quick and posi
tive relief." (Statement given Apr.
12, 1911.)
No trouble since. More than S
years later, Mrs. Lowe said: "I have
bad no ocoasion to use Doan's Kid
ney Pills for some years, as they
cured me of all symptoms of kid
ney disease."
Price 50o, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy
get Doan's kidney pills-the same
that Mrs Lowe has twice publicly
recommended. Foster-Milburn Co.*
