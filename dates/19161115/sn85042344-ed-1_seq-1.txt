CITY, N. J, Nov. 14.
Repudiation
by Luis Cabrera to
day of a plan of border control tliut
Had been agreed upon by two of Ills
colleagues and the three American
Itiemlier.s again has made doubtful the
ability of the Americans on the Mexi
can-American Joint commission to us-H
Blst Mexico lu Its efforts to restore
normal conditions along the frontier.
The Americuns were hopeful to
night that they might yet induce the
Mexicans to agree to what they be
leve will bo u satisfartot y plan for
the protection of life and property
along the boundary, but it w.is Indi
cated by those in touch with them
that further opposition dun ucterl.ed
ns quibbling would not long he tol
erated. May KiiiI Conference.
There appeared reason tonight to
lielieve that unless the chairman of
the Mexican commission Adopted a
more tractable manner hp and his
unsocial! h would be Informed that
further consideration of Mexico's so
cial, economic and military problem
must pome to an end.
The agreement that provided for
the withdrawal of the American pu
nitive expedition now in Chihuuhiia
nnd for a method of dealing with
border raiders In the future was
reached yesterday. Tgnuclt Ronil
las and. Alberto .1. Paul of the Mexi
can commission concurring. Mr. Ca
brera, chairman of the Mexican 'ei-J-esentntion,
went to Philadelphia,
where he conferred with Rafael Nle
to, HuhspiTPtary of the dcpuitnient of
finance, of which Mr. Cabrera is
chief. When ho reappeared In the
committee room tonight he announced
liis opposition to the details of tho
plan agreed upon.
The commissioners themselves have
remained reticent regarding the unex
pected opposition by Mr. Cabrera and
all have declined to discuss for publi
cation the details of the plan agreed
Upon.
It Is known, however, Mr. Cabrera's
expression of his dissatisfaction w;ur
vehement.
Did Not Please linn
That the agreement on the part of
tho Americans for the w it lull awul of
the troops did not provide for their
Immediate retirement was imiiciited.
It stipulated, it is understood, that
they should be brought out within a
fixed time if within that period the
Carrangu government had demon
strated its ability to giinr-i the border
uguiiud raiding bandits.
The session at whlh Mr. Cabrera
entered his protest against the
adopted plan was not finished until
Ions after noon. The Amei leans had
expected to hold the usual second kps
Kion in the afternoon, but as Mr. Ca
brera announced that It w is necessary
for hin: lo return to Philadelphia,
there was no meeting this afternoon.

Tin attitude of the railways w

"We cannot understand the alti
