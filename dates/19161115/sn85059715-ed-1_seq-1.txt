WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IN
FRANCE, Nov. 15.?The British advance
along.both sides of the Ancre
which continued Tuesday with the*
capture of the village of Beaucourt is
considered by the British commanders
as one of the most Important successes
in the four months of the offensive.
They insist especially on the
relatively insignificant character of
the German resistance in a position
which they consider of gTeat strategic
imp<$rtance, and one of the most highly
fortified on the* entire western
front.
More than 5.000 prisoners have
been collected in the extensive subterranean
galleries and chambers
wjiich were sunk on both sides of the
valley, and were miles in extent. Five
hundred Germans surrendered in a
tunnel near St. Pierre Divion. which
was a mile and a half long. This tunner
gave access to 'scores of electric
lighted chambers in which companies
of infantry were housed and which
contained quantities of machine guns
and bombs. Another 700 prisoners
were cought in a ravine 'south of
Beaumont-Hamel, where they were
cut,off by the first attack on Monday
.afternoon.

With a campaign about to begin here
for the erection of a woman's and children's

Allsup writes as follows:
"A campaign is to be launched, so I
am informed, on Thursday of this
week, toward the erection of a Women's
and Cnildren's hospital in the
city of Clarksburg.
"I can think of no institution which
; would be more necessary in this com
munity, for accomplishment of
this purpose, than such a one as Is
proposed; a .complement institution
to the other good works that.the people
i of Clarksburg have recently organized.
' This hospital wDl draw a. patronage
! from all the surrounding towns, for
. there is no institution near us doing
this class of work.
"It is nearly impossible, when particular
help Jb most needed in the i
home, to secure such trained help, and)
this institution will undoubtedly be-1
come one of the most helpful ones in
our city."
