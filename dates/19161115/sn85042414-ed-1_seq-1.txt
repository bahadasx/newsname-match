'Washington, Nov. 15.—Attorney
General Gregory haa decided that the
suits by the railroads against the en
forcement of the Adamson eight-hour
law will be defended by the depart
ment of justice. The defense to be
presented In each case is to be worked

Railroads Accept Battle.
New York, Nov. 15.—The New
York Central railroad has filed in the
federal district court here the first in
junction suit to be brought by an East
ern road to test the constitutionality
of the Adamson law, it was announced
by Albert H. I. Harris, general counsel
for the New York Central today.
The action is directed against Uni
ted States District Attorney Snowden
here, and several local officers of the
four trainmen's brotherhoods. A
temporary stay will be sought, which
will enjoin the defendants from in
stituting prosecutions against the
road to compel it carry out the law.
5,000 Suits Are likely.
Railway managers comprising the
natlflhal^(inference committee contin
ued today the conspiration. of whetJv
er wholesale legal action to defeat the
Adamson eight-hour law will be taken
or whether a limited series of in
June-'
tlorii will be filed. The concensus of
opinlon favored the former course,
which would result in approximately
5,000 actions, covering the entire rail
road territory of the United States.
Whichever method is selected, the
cases are expected to be in the courts
within a few days.
The Railroads' Stand.
The attitude of the railways was
summarized in a statement issued by
Elisha Lee at the close of an all-day
meeting of the railroad representa
tives. The statement follows:
"We are all agreed to fight to the
end- The means to be employed were
fully discussed and the consensus of
opinion was that it was necessary to
file suits questioning the constitution
ality of the law in every federal dis
trict court in which the affected rail-,
roads operate."
leave it Up to Wilson.
Warren S. Stone, president of the
Brotherhood of. Locomotive Engi
neers, summarised the brotherhood's
side of the case just before boarding
a train for Cleveland.
Mr. Stone said:
"The situation is closed in so far as
we are concerned. We are not at all
alarmed. We know what President
Wilson Intended we should have. We
know the explanation he made to our
six hundred chairmen in the White
House. We feel confident that if the
present law does not give us the eight
hour day, the president will give us a
law that will.
"We can't understand the attitude
of the railroad managers. They did
not file their first suits until the day
after eleetion, believing that Mr.
Hughes had been elected. Personal
ly, I believe they are either whistling
to keep up their courage or they are
trying to scare the public Into sympa
thizing with them."
Great Northern Files Suit.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 15—The Great
Northern railroad has aaked the fed
eral district court here for an order
to prevent the enforcement of the
Adamson law. The suit is the first
filed by a road In this territory and is
similar to suits filed by the Louisville
and Nashville, the Athcison, Topeka
and Santa Fe and the Union Pacific.
Named as defendant* are Alfred
Jacques of Duluth, United 8tate's dis
trict attorney F. A. Mallen. local
chairman of the Order of Railway
Conductors A. K. Rowe, local chair
man of the Brotherhood of Locomo

man of the Firemen and Enginemen,
and P. A. Porter, local chairman of

The enforcement of .the Adamson
law will result in great financial loss
to the railroad, according to the peti

survey. She reached Nassau on No
vember C.
The exact nature of the case against
the Keeney has not bean made known
but the report brought from Nassau
is that she was seized as a suspicious
vessel, partly on account of the' fact
that she was laden with sulphuric
acid. This cargo led the local British
officials to suspect that she Intended
to assist a submarine from a nation
hostile to Great Britain.
The American consul at Nassau
was permitted to appoint a board of
inquiry but at the time the Esperanza
sailed no decision on the part of the
board had been reached. Further in
formation was refused by the govern
ment and the captain of the schooner.

eral of the Bahamas, arrived on the
Esperanza and is understood to have

Speaker Recalls Three Great
Battles Lasting Months
on House Control.
Washington, Nov. 15.—Speaker
Clark in seeking to find comfort for
the Democrats in the congressional
situation which stands 217 Republi
cans to.212 Democrats in the house,
said:
"The only thing to be done is to
watch the official count in all the dis
tricts and wait for the final results.
Three times in the history of the gov
ernment there have been prolonged
contests over the election of a speak
er. Twice it took three months and
once it required two months and a
half to elect .the speaker.
"The first long fight was in 1851
when Howell Cobb of Georgia was
elected speaker after a fight lasting
more than two months, during which
no party could get a majority.
"The fights which lasted three
months ended in the election of Gov
ernor Pennington of New Jersey in
1860 and General Banks of Massa
chusetts in 1856.
"The struggle was hot in both these
contests and they were only deter
mined after the house had adopted
a resolution which provided that only
ten more ballots be taken and if on
the tenth ballot no candidate had a
majority, the man who had the
plurality should be declared elected.
It was agreed that enough members
would change their votes after the
tenth ballot to give the candidate
with the .plurality the legnl majority.
"The most interesting of these con
tests was that in 1856 John Sherman,
Republican, of Ohio, was the. leading
candidate. Everytime Sherman would
appear to be near election, a member
named John B. Clark of Missouri—
no kin of mine—a radical secessionist,
would denounce Sherman for having
recommended an abolitionist book
written by a man named Helper.
These speeches ended Sherman's
chances and Banks finally was
elected."

Berlin, Nov. 15.—(Via London.)—
Opening of peace negotiations may,
perhaps, be expected with fair pros
pects of success in the course of tho

bert Apponyi, veteran Hungarian lead
er and former Hungarian premier.
Count Apponyi, who is visiting Ger

views in an interview given to the
correspondent of the Associated

eral European situation.
After Rumania Is Conquered.
"We cannot expect to see peace
negotiations opened within the next
few weeks, while the Rumanian cam
paign still is undecided," he said.
"However, I regard our chances for
success there as excellent and once
Rumania is crushed, I think both
sides will be willing to consider the
question of peace."
"Rumania was the entente's last
care and is proving a losing one.
"We are massing a big army against
the Rumanians and I think the end
will come shortly. Of course, our
progress on the Transylvanian front
is a bit slow, owing to the great dif
ficulties of the country, and particu
larly to deficiency regarding communi

Britisher Claims Franco Has Had

New York. Nov. 15.—An English
man well known in London. New
York and Paris, who arrived yester
day on the American liner St. Paul
from Liverpool, was emphatic in his
assertion that Germany was secretly
making overtures for peace to France.
"When 1 was in Paris two weeks
ago," he said. "I was informed by an
official of high rank, whose word was
Indisputable, that every two weeks
during the previous two months Ger
many had sent communications to the
French government asking for an ar
mistice with a view to discussing
terms of peace.
"The German artillery is not up to
the standard it was earlier in the war
and the soldiers do not fight with the
enthusiasm they did. Both officers
and men of the German army are
tired of the war and the allies know it.
"It was also known to the allies
that Germany induced Ambassador
Gerard to po to Washington and ask
President Wilson to open up negotia
tions for peace. In return the prom
ise was made to him that the U-boat
warfare would not be waged in a
ruthless manner pending his absence.
"This was the reason why Lloyd
George made his famous speech about
carrying on the war to the end. with
a double object in view, one to stop
a peace propaganda emanating from
the United States and the other to
keep down the pacifists at home."
