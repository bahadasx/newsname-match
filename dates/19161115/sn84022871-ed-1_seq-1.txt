Boy" Shfot and Killed in Row at Island
Pond.
The state dailies have printed some
sensational stories about the shooting
of a boy at Island Pond. The truth
of the story appears to be about as
follows:
Archie Riggie, 16 years old, a son
of John Riggie, was shot and almost
instantly killed Wednesday night of
last week in a tenement of Miss Vina
Mousseau on Railroad street. Doctor's
were summoned but the lad lived only
a few minutes after their arrival.
This tragedy was the outcome of a
quarrel, somewhat of the nature of a
family feud and a drunken brawl, but
the victim was not one of the parties
engaged and, as is quite often the
case, was an innocent party.
There are many reports as to the
trouble leading up to the shooting, all
of which may have more or less truth,
but are lacking in the real facts in
the case. There was a row, bad blood
was shown, threats were made and
finally a revolver was brought into
play and a lad paid the penalty with
his life. Archie was standing near
the door of the tenement of Mrs. Stan
ley when the bullets struck him. Two
shots were fired, one entering the
side of the neck just below the ear,
and the other passing through the
heart. The bullets came near hitting
Mrs. Stanley.
Deputy Sheriff E. A. Bemis was
summoned and was soon on the scene.
He immediately got the state's attor
ney, Claire R. Powell, and a hasty in
vestigation was made.
Thursday forenoon Attorney Gen
eral Barber of Brattleboro and Dr. B.
H. Stone of the state laboratory of
hygiene arrived and an investigation
followed. At this hearing the parties
undergoing investigation were repre
sented by J. Rolfe Searles, attorney,
of St. Johnsbury.
No arrests have been made at this
writing.

At the morning service the subject
was, "The Faith that Jesus Sees."
The text was a clause from Matt. 9:2,
"And Jesus seeing their faith." The
sermon showed how we can exercise
faith for our friends, as well as for
ourselves, and Jesus honors such
faith. No one is poor if he can have
one true friend. And we are to show
our faith by our works as the four
friends of the sick man did.

Mystery of the Brownington Found
ling May Be Solved.
The mystery surrounding the child
left at the home of C. W. Skinner in
Brownington two weeks ago Sunday,
is thought to have been solved. The
authorities got busy upon one or two
slight clues and two different "leads"
bring up at the same place.
The automobile track found in
front of the Skinner house has been
found to be a track identical with the
track made by the car of a certain
Canadian physician, who lives just
across the line in Beebe, P. Q. This
doctor, said to be Gilfillan by name,
has a very unsavory reputation in
this part of Vermont. It is said he
has been supporting .a child in Can
ada, but is no longer financially able
to do so, and the belief is that he con
veyed the child by his car to the farm
in Brownington, where it was left.
The horse blanket spoken of as being
left with the child, is of Canadian
make and strengthens the opinion
that the chid came from across the
line.
The Monitor is unable to learn the
particulars of the case across the line
but Brownington authorities are sat
isfied that the child came from Can
ada and that the story of the child as
related above is substantially true.
As legal procedure seems to be out
of the question in this case, interna
tional complications entering into it,
the child will probably be given away
and legally adopted by someone.

In the passing of Levi P. Case on
the morning of November 5, Barton
loses one of its oldest residents.
Levi Parsons Case was born in
Coventry, October 9, 1827, the son of
Rev. Lyman Case and Phoebe Hollis
ter Case. His early life was spent in
Coventry and he received his educa
tion in the public schools of Coventry
and the academy at Brownington.
In the early fifties he went to New
York state where for many years he
was a successful photographer. He
was married November 3, 1862 to
Sarah E. Leonard at Westville, N. Y.,
and to them four children were born,
Charles E., who died in infancy, Nellie
E., now Mrs. H. J. Stannard, Laura
B., and Bertha L., who died in 1891,
at the age of fourteen years.
Returning to Coventry, where he
lived for several years, Mr. Case in
the fall of 1882, came to Barton onto
the farm west of the village, now
owned by C. T. Miles, where he lived
until the summer of 1911, when the
buildings were burned.
Mr. Case had been in failing health
for several years and during his. long
illness was very patient, and although
unable to read on account of failing
sight, never lost interest in public af
fairs. He was a genial, kind-hearted
man, one who never wished ill of any
one, highly respected, of upright
character, a Christian gentleman of
the old school.
He is survived by his wife, two
daughters, Mrs. H. J. Stannard and
Laura B. Case, and one brother,
Charles H. Case of Chicago. Services
were held at the home Tuesday after
non, Nov. 7, at 1.30 o'clock. The
bearers were A. R. Wakeman, R. M.
Gilmour and Milo Owen, old neigh
bors of the deceased, and C. T. Miles,
who now owns the Case farm. Inter
ment was in the family lot in Wel
come O. Brown cemetery.
. Mrs. Altha Pierce.
The community was srreatlv shocked
and saddened Saturday evening to
learn ot the death of Mrs. Altha
Pierce, who had been ill but a few
days.
Altha Dutton was born in Royal
ton July 3, 1855, the only child of
Edward F. Dutton and Mary Baldwin
Dutton. When Mrs. Pierce was about
three years old, the family came to
Barton to live, and here she has spent
her life.
On Sept. 9, 1874, she was united in
marriage to Horace C. Pierce and to
them one son, Fred D., was born.
In the winter of 1905, Mr. and Mrs.
Pierce went to Pasadena, Calif., on
account of the ill health of Mr.
Pierce. Failing to regain his health,
he died there Feb. 21, 1906. Since
his death Mrs. Pierce has never re
covered from the great loss she sus
tained. Mrs. Pierce was a woman of strong
character, a great lover of her home,
a devoted wife and mother, an earn
est worker in the Order of the East
ern Star, of which she was the first
Worthy Matron of Orient Chanter.
No. 13, and for twelve years has been
its faithful treasurer and has also
held the office of Grand Ruth in the
grand chapter.
She leaves to mourn her loss her
mother, Mrs. Mary Dutton, and son,
Fred D. Pierce of this place.

Barton Boy in Small Boat Adrift on
Sea at Night.
The following from a Portland, Me.,
paper tells its own story of the thrill
ing experience of a Barton boy, Ralph
Church, who was brought up at the
home of J. P. Telfer.
"Driven ashore in a small Hamp
ton fishing boat within half a mile of
their own home aftr having been
adrift in the open sea for nearly eight
hours, Ralph Church, age 21, and his
17-year-old wife, narrowly escaped
drowning at 2 o'clock this morning
(Oct. 17.) Today the young couple
are confined to their Long Island
home suffering from exposure and
bruises received when they were
thrown on the ragged ledges on Long
Island.
"The young couple were in Port
land yesterday and about 4 in the
afternoon they started for their home
on the southeast side of Long Island
in the Hampton fishing boat owned
by Captain Herbert Johnson, the fa
ther of Mrs. Church. At that time
the wind was blowing about 20 miles
an hour, but young Church did not
entertain any fear about reaching
home safely.
"When the boat got down by the
Breakwater light the engine com
menced to act badly and shortly after
5 the boat drifted out Hussey's Sound
into the open sea. Every effort of
Church to start the gasoline motor
failed and as darkness came on the
young couple feared that they would
never be able to reach land.
"How far the boat drifted out to
sea Church could not tell today. He
says that he tried to make some head
way with the big oars and although
his hands became blistered and sore
he kept at his task until the oarlock
broke and the oar was swept into the
sea.
"As the little Hampton boat vas
not provided with anything that
could be used as a sail 'both Church
and his young wife gave up all hope
oi ever reacning land. or nours
tneir iittie Doat was tossed about by
the tremendous seas. Huge waves
swept over the tiny craft. It was
shortly after midnight when the two
occupants of the boat heard the sea
breaking on the rocks. They did not
have the slightest idea where they
were, a few minutes later the boat
was swept on the crest of a big wave
onto the rocks.
"Although Church was nearly ex
hausted he grasped his wife in his
arms and was soon struggling in the
water. Several times he stumbled
and fell, but he swam on until his
feet touched bottom and then he wa
ded ashore to find that they had been
driven ashore within half a mile of
their own home. Chilled and suffer
ing from their terrible experience the
young couple finally reached home
where they were met by relatives and
neighbors who had feared that the
young folks had been swept out to sea
or drowned.
"While the boat containing Mr. and
Mrs. Church was drifting out to sea
their failure to return to the Island
from Portland aroused the anxiety of
Captain Johnson and after learning
that his daughter and her husband
had started for home in the motor
boat he left home in another boat to
search for them. He came up the bay
to Portland, but of course he did not
see anything of the missing boat and
later returned home to find that
searching parties there had not been
able to find Mr. and Mrs. Church or
the boat in which they had left Port
land. "Today the boat in which Mr. and
Mrs. Church were swept ashore was
left high and dry on the ledges by the
outgoing tide. The craft was badly
battered by the pounding it had re
ceived on the rocks, but was floated
durir.g the afternoon and will be re
paired." . COVENTRY

THE FREEMAN'S MEETING. ";
A freeman's meeting is held every
two years, the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in November. The civ
ics class had been planning to go to
the freeman's meeting for some time.
When we went into the hall Mr. Cook,
the ballot clerk, showed us the ballots.
We learned that United States offi
cers, state, county and town officers
are elected at the freeman's meeting,
also the president is elected every
four years. The constable had charge
of the meeting. There was a railing
along the right of the room and two
places were left where the men could
go in and come out. At 3 o'clock the
box containing the votes for repre
sentative to legislature was turned.
That meant that no more votes could
be put into the box. At five o'clock
the rest of the votes were counted.

TRAINING CLASS NOTES
The training class extends most
sincere thanks to the ladies of Barton
for a number of handsome plants
which add much to the attractiveness
of the room.
Ask H. C, how one of Napoleon's
soldiers, who having already lost one
arm, took his sword and cut off his
remaining arm to show his faithful
ness to his master.
Information! The members of the
training class were not on a presi
dential campaign parade Thursday
when they went up Main street draw
ing an express cart, and armed with
shovels.
The members of the training class
had a very instructive lesson Tuesday
afternoon, a lesson that will help
them to vote in the next presidential
election. The class was held at the
polls, the text was ballots, and the in
structors were the voters and the
clerks. .
A most interesting letter from a
member of the Richmond. Va., high
school was received last week by Miss
Prue. The class was surprised to hear
that next to tobacco, the peanut is
Virginia's most important product.
The writer promised that a box of
characteristic products of Virginia
should be shipped to the training class
very soon.
Monday morning the teachers of
North Troy paid us a most pleasant
visit. We heartily welcomed them all
but we felt that Mrs. Oliver, the
North Troy training teacher, was our
special guest. On Friday teachers
from Lowell called at our room. Our
first visitors were from outside towns
but we hope Barton will contribute
her share of calls.
