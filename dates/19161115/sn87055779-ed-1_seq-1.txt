Pres't Tumulty today declirfeu u
comment upon the conference. It
was pointed out by persons close to
the president, however, that "there
has been a lot of peace talk lately."
Whether Pres't Wil-on will con
tinue longer in his former determ
ination that the "time is not rjje"
for peace efforts was a matter of,
doubt.
It is known that serious consider
ation is being given l, re to contin
ued efforts in European quarters to
have the pope, 'Ves't Wilsen and
the king of Spain join in asking the
belligerent nat'.ns to dechire for
peace.
No immediate action is expected
whatever the president's decision,
because of Viscount Grey's statement
in the British blacklist note, made
public this morning, that "even
though the military situation of the I
allies has greatly improved there is j
still a long and bitter struggle In
front of them."
It is believed certain tht if any
peace s'iep is made at present It
would merely be to "feel out" Fng
land on the subject without the
other belligerent nations being ap
proached. Reports Also were current that
the president was discussing prob
able cabinet changes with Col.
House, notwithstanding semi-official
statements that "-"ere would be no
cabinet changes l r the president's
next term.
