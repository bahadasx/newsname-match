From fttrstegioal Viewpoint Raeent
8ueoess«s Are Greatest in Months.
[Copyright 1916, by Associated Press.]
With the ^British Armies in France,
Nov. lS.-i—The British advance on both
sides of the Anore, which continued
yesterday with the capture of Bou
court, is considered by the British com
mander as one of the most important
successes in the f^nr months' cam
paign. They insist that the place is of
great strategic importance and one of
.the most highly fortified on the entire
western front.
More than 5,000 prisoners have been
collected in the. extensive subterranean
galleries and chambers which were
bunk on* both sides of the valley and
Were mllee In extent. Five hundred
German*.surrendered in a tunnel near
St. .Pierre pivian, which was a mile
and a half loijg. The tunnel gave ac

quantities of machine guns and bombs.
Another 700,Jr:soners r.-crc caught in a
ravine-' south of Beaumont-Hamel,
where they were cut off by the flrst
attack on Monday afternoon.
fresh Troops Are Trapped.,
V-The* British success south of the
Anore was increased owing to tho fact
that the Germans in, this sector were
on the point of being relieved by fresh
troops When the attack was made. As
a result twice the usual number of
men stationed there were trapped.
Here many men of the Ninety-third in.
fantry, of Wjilish the Duke of Albany is

A tank, which helped to destroy ma

the valley, south of the Ancre, was
attacked with bombs by Germans. All
of the attackers were killed by the
guns of the tank.
Two-thirds of the British casualties
south of the Ancre were walking cases.
The total losses were lighter In pro
portion than any previous operations
in the past four' hionths. All ground

iNew York, Nov. 15.—The New York
Cer.tral railroad today filed suit in the
federal district court to test the con
stitutionality of the Adamson eight
hour law. The' suit is directed against
the-•three federal district attorneys of
New York state and tlhe chairman of
each of the four brotherhoods in the
state.
The road's principal contention, ac
cording to Albert H. Harris, general
counsel, is that the Adamson law is
"in no sense a regulation of commerce
but a temporairy and arbitrary In
crease of wages for the brotherhood
men,"
Washington, Nov. 15.—Attorney Gen
eral Gregory has decidcd that suits by
railroads against enforcement of the
Adamson eight-hour iaw will be de
fended by. the department of justice.
The defense to be presented in each
case will be worked out between Soli
citor General Davis and other depart
ment officials with United States /at
torneys in various jurisdictions.
The department was unable to de
termine today whether it was" necessa
ry to defend each of the suits begun or
whether the roads would be willing to
make a test suit of one case. No word
has come from the roads and if such a
proposal is'not mfide each suit will be
defended. Reports that the railroad
men had considered a suggestion that
the Adamson law be suspended for
thirty days has met with the statement
that the attorney general has no such

WILSON TO TAKE OATH TWICfe.
To Be Sworn in First on Sunday, March
4, and on Monday.
Washington, Nov. 15.—After an ex
amination of its records In a search for
precedents, the state department holds
"that In Its view there is no interval
between the term of one president and
the beginning of his successor, altho
there may be a slight interval when
the executive power Is suspended."
The department also holds that the
fact that President Wilson's flrst term
will expire on Sunday, March 4, will not
leave a hiatus In the office of president
until noon on Monday, March 5, 1917,
when Mr. Wilson will formally take the
oath of office for a second term at the
capitol in Washington.
However, to prevent question of au
thority on March 4, Secretary Lansing
will advise President Wilson to take the
oath on that day. The oath will be re
administered on Monday.
DID CHINKS ELECT WILSON?
Orientals Claim Credit For Carrying'
California For President.
Chicago, Nov. 15. The warring
tongs of Chinatown called a truce to
celebrate the re-election of President
Wilson. There was no parade, but
over their chop suey the On Leongf
and the Hep Sings toasted the victor,
and also gave credit to the Chinese of
California without whose support, it is
said, Wilson could not have carried the
state. Frank Moy, president of the On
Leong tong, said the re-election of
Wilson was a great victory for the
Chinese. The same opinion was voiced
by Yung Gow, president of the Hep
Sing tong.
"In the vote of California that was
so badly needed to re-elect President
Wilson," said Moy, "the Chinaman has
been overlooked. Chinese bcjrn In this
country are citizens of the United
States and are entitled to vote. There
are about 4,000 of these voters in Cali
fornia.
"Chinese newspapers printed in San
Francisco favored the election of Mr.
Hughes, but I know from letters re
ceived by Chicago Chinamen that the
majority of the Chinese vote in Cali
fornia wept to Wilson. Here in CJjt

am convinced th%t more than 75 per
cent of the Chinese voted for the dem

"Wouldn't It be a funny thing if the
re-election of President Wilson hinged
upon thfe Chinese vote of California?
The 'Chink' votb, as It Is called by
American*, has never been given a
serious or even a humorous thought.
"Candidates for office hereafter In
California will have to pay a little at
tention the Chinese. We hold the
balance.- $f power.'
"It is tip t^ the democratic party to
recognise the Chinaman. A democratic
congressman from Pennsylvania I
think his name was Scott—had the bill
passed excluding the Chinese from the
United 9|tatei. And now the Chinese
born here elect a democratic president.
Can you beat it?
"The Chinese vote of Chicago is con
fined to/ the First ward. But it Is not
big enough to scare anybody. No
Chinaman will run for alderman for a
faw years at least."
BRITAIN DEFENDS
U. S. BLACKLIST
Rejects Protests Made by Washington
Government—Asserts Acts Will Help
Bring War to Conclusion^— Issue Still
Open.
Washington, Nov. 15.—The British
reply to the latest American note pro
testing against the trade blacklist,
made public last night by the state
department, denies that rights of neu
tral traders under international law
have been ruthlessly cancelled, defines
the blacklist measure as a municipal
regulatiohrjplalnly concerning only the
British government and British citi
zens and" pontends that it is designed to
shorten, the war.
The note falls to. meet the American
demand that the names of American
firms be stricken from the blacklist,
but attempts to convince the state de
partment that the British position 1s
Just and founded on law. It leaves
open the door for further negotiation,
which Is expected to follow.
The note was received by the state
department last month, but publica
tion was suppressed until after the
election.
The note was subscribed by Viscount
Grey, the British foreign minister, and
was addressed to and transmitted by
Walter 'Hines Page, the American am
bassador at London.
Dwells on Peace Issue.
A part which attracted much official
notice dealt with the subject of peace,
based on the theory that one American
contention'had been that there exists
no military necessity for the blacklist,
that It Is unnecessary for the allies to
prejudice,, neutral commerce, and that
nothing which happens in distant neu
tral countries can influence the result
of the great conflict.
"If that really were the position,"
says' the note, "It is possible that the
measures tauten by his majesty's'gov
ernment might be described as uncall
'ett"fOrrrbut it is not. "We may well
wish that- it were So. Even tho the
imilltarjr situation of the allies had
andf bitter "straggle In ^ront Of them
and one which in justice to the prin
ciples for which they are "fighting im
poses upon them the duty of employ
ing every, opportunity and every meas
ure which they can legitimately use to
overcome their opponents.
"Petty" Acts Weighty.
"One observation which is very com
monly heard is that certain belligerent
aots, even tho lawful, are too petty to
have any influence in a struggle of
such magnitude. 5tt Is, I know, diffi
cult for those who have no immediate
contact with war to realize with what
painful anxiety men and women In this
country must regard even the smallest
acts which tend to Increase, if only by
a hair's breadth, the danger in which
their relatives and friends daily stand,
or to prolong, if only by a minute, the
period during which they are to be ex
posed to such perils.
"Whatever inconvenience may be
caused to neutral nations by the exer
cise of belligerent rights it is not to be
compared for an instant to the suffer
ing and loss occasioned to mankind by
the prolongation of the war even for a
week."
In-its argument the note points out
that German business houses thruout
the world have furthered the cause of
Germany in the war and have been ac
tive agents "for the dissemination of
German political and social Influence
and for the purposes of espionage."
Regard Reply as Convincing.
London, Nov. IS.—The Times, com
menting on Viseniint Grey's note to the
United States In xegard to the British
blacklist says:
"The reasoning of this convincing
document must satisfy the government
and people of the United States" that
they have misunderstood the measure
against which they thought it right to
protest. Their note declared that these
measures were inconsistent with the
rights of neutrals. Viscount Grey joins
issue upon this contention and proves
that they do not Impair neutral rights
as the statute is a piece of purely
municipal legislation. We have too
high an opinion of American sense of
justice and law to suppose that our
rights, legal and moral, to adopt these
measures, once their true character is
understood, will be Questioned."
ADVANCE IN STEEL RAILS.

New York, Nov. 15.—The United

Watchers For Both Parties Watching
Closely the Official Count-~Only
Slight Discrepancies Found'in Offi
cial Returns From West
(Virginia,
Which Is Apparently For Hughes—
Gregory Promises Investigation.
Washington. Nov. 15.—President
Wilson received many messages today
from democratic leaders in California,
saying there would be no change In
the electoral vote to give the state to
Hughes. Gavin McNabb, democratic
national committeeman, telegraphed
that the final official count would show
no change from the unofficial report
Shn Francisco, Nov. 15.—Thirty coun
ties in California remained to be heard
from today in the official canvass of
the election. Early returns from five
counties made the difference between
the lowest democratic elector and the
highest republican elector 5,361.
Both parties admit that a big dis
crepancy must be found in order to
change the result of the election and
this must come from ihe three most
populous counties—San Francisco, Los
Angeles or Alameda.
The first day's work in these .counties
disclosed only minor errors and such
errors were found to offset each other.'
Watchers of both parties were on hand
today when the canvass was resumed.
With 212 precincts out of 410 offi
cially counted in Alameda county,
Wilson has made a net gain of
eighteen votes over Hughes.
Hughes Makes Slight Gain.
Los Angeles, Cal., Nov. 15.—One pre
cinct in Los Angeles was thrown out
today by the board of supervisors in
tho checking preliminary because Its
tally sheet showed thrqe more votes
than were recorded In the registration
bcoks. This preclntct was credited
with 125 votes for Hughes and 139 for
Wilson, the remainder being scattered.
Errors such as this and the striking
out of fourteen tallies for prohibition
electors on a tally sheet caused seven
teen' election officials to be summoned
to explain their work.

^Slight Changes in West Virginia.
Charleston, W. Va, Nov. 15.—No of
ficial election returns have been re
ceived at the office of 4he secretary of
state but it is expected the vote of the
smaller counties, will be.recorded to
night. Changes are recorded and con
testing candidates are watching them
carefully. The count will likely be
completed soon, when the recount de
manded by democratic candidates will
begin. Forty of the ninety-seven pre
cincts in Kanawha county showed a net
gain of eleven for Wilson and fifteen
for Cornwall, the democratic candidate
for governor. Senator Chilton de
clared today that/ official returns so far
show there is an unaccountable dis
crepancy in the total vote cast for
United States senator and that for
president.
Promises Non-Partisan Investigation.
Washington, Nov 15.—Investigation
of election frauds was discussed briefly
today between President Wilson and
Attorney General Gregory. Later Mr.
Gregory said:
"My sole duty Is to Investigate and
prosecute violations of the election
law. The investigation now in pro
gress is entirely non-partisan, and evi
dence from both democratic and re
publican sources will be given equal
attention.
'I have evidence that a large num
ber of negroes from the south moved
into northern states within ninety days
before election. I do not know wheth
er this movement was industrial or po
litical."
Hughes Gains In Minnesota.
St. Paul, Nov. 15.—The Hughes lead
in Minnesota suffered many chunges
and stands at slightly more than 1,000.
Returns came slowly Into the capital,
and there were several differences be
tween them and the unofficial returns
previously published. There was a con
sistent gain for Hughes In the after
noon figures. The vote, after a com
plete re-check, stood: Wilson, 178,2B0

1,004.

Idaho Elector Holding State Position
May Be Disqualified.
Boise, Idaho, Nov. 16. Because
James E. Pinciock, one of the four
democratic presidential electors chosen
In Idaho, also was a candidate from
Custer county and was elected, Idaho's
electoral vote, instead of being four for
President Wilson, is likely to stand
three for Wilson and one for Hughes, it
was reported here. The law disquali
fies any presidential elector who is also
a holder of a state position, and Pin
cock's eligibility probably will be
tested, political leaders say. If he is
disqualified, the highest republican'
elector may cast his vote/
The enormous increase in Idaho's
vote, estimated at about 86,000 over t\e
vote of two years ago, has led to offi

and Germans Are Abandoning

.lln, via London, Nov. IS.—Th«
opuilng of peace negotiations may per
haps be expected with fair prospects jpI
success In the course of the ooming
winter, according to Count Albeit Ap
ponyl, veteran 'Hungarian leader and
former Hungarian premier. Count Ap
ponyi, who Is visiting Germany to de
liver two addresses on Hungarian his
tory, expressed hia^views In an Inter
view given a correspondent of th« As*
sociated Press, in which he discussed
the general JBuropean situation.
"We oan not expect," he said, "to
see peace negotiations opened In the
next few weeks while the Roumanian
campaign is undecided. However* I
regard our chances there exoeiient, and
once this is accomplished I think both
sides will be willing to consider peace
Roumania was the entente's last card
and It is proving a losing one. Of
course, our progress on the Transyl
vanian front is a bit slow, owing to the
difficulties of the country. The com
munications there are poorer than la
the west and even In Oalida and Rus
sia. The entry of Roumania into th«
war has been really advantageous to
us."
Leaders Drawing Nearer. 1
To Illustrate what he considers the
growing chances for peaoe he referred
to recent speeches of statesmen to op
posing camps.
"Not Lloyd George," he taAarJeetadt
"but such as Lord Grey and Chancel
lor von Bethmann-fHollweg. A yw
ago their respective standpoints weiO
as far apart as the poles, but n0w, al
tho there are still wide differences be
tween them, they have moat appveat*
ably drawn nearer. The crushing ef
Germany Is eliminated la JQpitlafc pro*
nouncements and the Idea (f .aaaeM#
tion of territory Is dwindling
many."
•He -said he saw DO reason why nsa
tral mediation should not bo welcome
when the opportune moment* arrived,
and added that he knerw no reason why
President Wilson would not be accept*
able as a medlary.
"We feel of course, that President
Wilson, has not treated us fairly. But
even tho one does not like a person
that is no reason for rejecting his serv
ices when these may be useful."
