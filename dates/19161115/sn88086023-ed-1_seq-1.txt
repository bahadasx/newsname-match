feared Britain and France may ask
the United States to stop Belgian re

It has been learned the Germans
have adopted a policy of declaring
"destitute" all able bodied Belgians
accepting American aid. Such Bel

strain on charity. The allies consid

The government took up the matte'

and tell him the wholesale deporta

Grew told the state department that
Under-Secretary Zimmerman declar.

Germany therefore has adopted a
policy of compelling them to labor.
He explained that the government's

government, who argued the deporta.

practically be under the same man
agement as the 1916 Round-Up by
reason of the re-election of the entire
board of directors last evening ut the
annual meeting of the stockholders
Though H. W. Collins had tendered
his resignation it was not acted upon
and. in case he or any other member
resigns, the remainder of the board
was authorized to select a successor.
The report of the individual direc
tors last evening showed that the
Round-Up is in a very satisfactorj
financial condition. The show of 1916
was not only a success from a show
standpoint but was one of the most
financially successful held for sev
eral years despite the fact that it cost
considerably more than the 1915
show. The association is out of debt
with a cash balance to its credit for
meeting the initial expenses of tne
show next year.
