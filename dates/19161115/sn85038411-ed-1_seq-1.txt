New York, Nov. la. Railway
managers comprising the "national
conference committee" continued to-j
clay consideration of whether whole-1
sale legal action to defeat the Adam -1
son eight-hour law will be taken or j
whether a limited series of injunctions
will be filed. The consensus of opinion ;
was said to favor the former course, j
which would result in approximately
5,000 actions, covering the entire rail-1
road territory of the United States. !
Tn view of the fact that the New
lands committee is to hold public |
hearings on the railroad situation i
generally beginning next Monday!
there was an indication that definite j
action would be postponed until the i
conclusion of these hearings.
'l'o-daj 's Developments
Two developments stood out to-day!
in the situation arising from the forth- |
coming application of the Adamson
law:
"First, the announcement that
the managers of the roads would
probably apply for injunctions

Price of Food Is Taken
Up in House of Commons
London, Nov. 16. The price of
food, which lias become such a ser- j
icus matter in England as in all other I
belligerent countries, was discussed j
in the House of Commons to-day.
William Hewins, Unionist member
from Hereford, introduced the fol- j
lowing resolution:
"In the opinion of the House it is i
the duty of the government to adopt [
further methods of organization to !
increase and conserve the national i
food supply and to diminish the risk j
of shortage and serious increase of
prices in the event of the war being |
prolonged."
The debate on this resolution if'
not arranged by the government, took 1
place In concurrence with its wishes 1
and Walter ltuncieman, president of
the Board of Trade was expected to '
announce drastic proposals to deal
with the difficulties of the present
position.
The activity of German submarines
in sinking a large number of ships,
which is related so closely to the price
of food, will be discussed in the House
of Lords this evening by Lord Charles
lieresford and Baron Syndenham.

Helena. Mont., Nov. 15.—Nearly nil of

of the extreme cold weather which has

at this time was said by operators to

Washington, D. C., Nov. 15. De
portation of Belgian civilians into Ger
many for forced labor has reached
I such serious proportions that Ameri
can Charge Grew at Berlin has been
1 directed by the State Department to
I take the matter up personally with
j Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg.
| The Charge was requested to say that
'such deportations could not but have
ja most unfavorable effect on neutral
'opinion, particularly in the United
! States, which has the welfare of the
Belgian civilian population very much
iat heart.
The instructions, it was learned
grew out of a long report from Charge
Grew, in which ho sated that ho had

j unofficially with Under Secretary of
1 Foreign Affairs Zimmerman. The
j latter admitted that a definite policy
I had been adopted to enforce the labor
jof Belgians in cases where they would

that so many refused to work as to
make the strain on public charity
intolerable.
