Wide divergence in many instances

the report of Auditor H. Gooding
Field, made public at the meeting yes
terday afternoon. Is a startling feiture
shown by a supplemental report of the
latter filed with the commission.
A. J. Gignoux, still a member of the
utilities commission, was one of the
two who signed the report, the other
commissioner being J. N. S. Williams,
who resigned from .the territorial
body some months ago. The follow

Other bits of the 1914 report con
cerning the financlar workings of 'the
steamship company do not agree with
things as Field says he found them.
The 1914 report has this to say: -Brings
Up Insurance Fund
"Instead cf paying out of its own
earnings an amount variously estimat
ed at from 4 per cent to 6 per cent on
the replacement value , of Its steam
ers, there Is" withdrawn annually from
the gross earnings of the floating
equipment a sum fixed by the direct
ors at; regular meetings; this sum of
money is passed to the credit of the
insurance fund, which. is then held In
reserve to meet marine disaster, and
claims for damage to cargo by fire
and water, also -claims for injury of
death to Individuals of the various
'crews
"The question of the method of ad
ministering this fund so set apart
does not interest this commission,
which considers that its duty in this
direction Is to ascertain whether this
fund is so disposed of as to be avail
able at short notice to maintain the
efficiency of the equipment by replac
ing a steamer or steamers which may
be lost at sea. or destroyed by fire or
other mishap: or to pay claims for
losses or death, as the case may be.
"It appears that this Insurance fund
. is invested in such a way as to be read
ily available, and the interest accruing
; from the investment is passed to the
credit of profit and loss account and
therefore becomes available for dis
tribution among the stockholders, if
the directors so decide. It will be
noted that the amount so withdrawn
fcr the marine Insurance fund, from
the gross earnings for the year 19i3.
was $72,000, which is approximately
4 percent on the book value of the
steamer fleet of the Jnter-lsiarid
; team Navigation Company, and this
-ommission is assured by competent
authority that the premium on such
insurance if placed with a strong ma
rine insurance company would at last
equal this amount"
Finds No Investment
"Referring to the above statement.'
says Field's report, "I have failed to
find that an insurance fund, as such,
had been invested and, in conse
quence, there had been no interest
accruing from Its investment credited
to profit and loss account. The total
interest credited to profit and loss ac
count from all sources, including
loans, certificates of deposit, stocks
and bonds and corporation bonds on
December 31, 1915, amounted to ?2S.
082.48. From July 1, 1905, to March
1. 1916, however, the sum of $649,264.
77 had been-paid out of insurance fund

Verbal brickbats were tossed freely
this morning in a meeting of the Oahu
Loan Fund Commission held shortly
before the noon hour to decide wheth
er or not the low bid of Picanco &
Gomes on the Hillebrand Glen ditch
laying project should be accepted
against filed protests. The commis
sion adjourned after a lively session,
naming next Friday morning at 10
o'clock to decide definitely upon the
awarding of the contract.
James T. Taylor, special engineer
on the project since it first sprang into
existence and now a bidder for the
contract, and JVC. Pincanco of Picanco
& Gomes, spoke feelingly on opposite
sides of the question.
Taylor's remarks were strengthened
by a formal protest which he had filed
with the commission, while Picanco's
speech was long and rambling, often.
filled with broken English that was
difilcult to understand.
If Picanco is thrown out as a bid
der, however, it must be because of a
decision by the board that he is in
competent to carry out his offer. The
attorney general has ruled that the
slight mistake that he made in filing
his bid cannot be considered enough to
bar him. He was instructed today
by Chairman Charles R. Forbes to
bring any further testimony next Fri
day, while Taylor was told to bring
witnesses to bear out statements he
made today, or in their absence, affi
davits. Taylor Enters Protest
Taylor's protest was read before
the commission and is as follows:
"I hereby respectfully "protest
against the consideration of the bid
of Picanco & Gomes for constructing
the Maole conduit, Nuuanu valey,
under bid of f 18.353, submitted by
them upon the following grounds:
"1. That said bid is irregular and
informal in that the amount of said
bid does not correspond with the unit
prices shown.
"2. That said Picanco & Gomes are
not 'responsible bidders' as required
by law, in that (a) they do not pos
sess the requisite judgment, skill and
capacity required to perform the con
tract according to its terms; (b) that
they did in 1906 secure contract for
the construction of Iao valley road at
Wailuku, Maui, which they failed to
complete, forcing the completion of
the work upon their bondsmen at a
substantial unrepaid loss; (c) that the
work cannot be completed within the
time specified in their tender, to wit,
96 days ; nor at the price bid, to wit,
$18,535. which latter sum is $6000 less
than the next lowest bidder and is be-j
low the actual cost; (d) that the
total financial worth of the partner-,
ship property, according to their own
statement, is less than $500, and in j

WASHINGTON. D. C. Nov. 15. A
great legal battle over the Adamson
law passed at the last session of
Congress, the so-called railroad "eight
hour" law, is in prospect.
Attorney General Gregory announced
today that he has decided that the
pending suits by railroads to block
the enforcement of the law will b
defended by the department of jus

will be arrayed against some of the
foremost railroad attorneys'; of the
country.
The defense to be presented in each
case will be Worked out between So
licitor General Davis and other de
partment officials, in cooperation with
United States attorneys in various
jurisdiction?, covering every district
where a suit is started.
The department is yet unable to de
termine whether it will have to de
fend each of the suits already begun
or whether the railroads will be con
tent to make a test case on one suit,
letting the others drop in case of an
adverse decision in the courts.
In addition to the suits already
started, the Pennsylvania and New

Murray said today that the water

the streets are paved. "If we paxe
the streets and then tear them up
