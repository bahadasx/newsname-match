Commissioner Kirk Begins Inves­
tigation of Conditions in His
Department
POKER RAID GOES BAD
WITNESS CHANGES MIND
Night Captain Chris Martineson
Makes Pinch, but Evidence is
Withheld
Beginning this looming, City Attor­
ney F. E. McCurdy will "sit in" at the
quiet little sessions of Bismarck po­
lice. court, and there is reason to hope
that hereafter the deliberations and of­
ficial acts of that tribunal may be
made public property.
Police Commisisoner Kirk has been
"hearing things' for some time. Yes­
terday he resolved that the time had
come to act.' He will be represented
:it the police court sessions each day
until further notice by City Attorney
McCurdy. Prisoners arrested will be
given a hearing in open court a clear
record will be made of every case, and
a report will be made of all fines as­
sessed and collected.
Commission in Dark.
Heretofore the police court has been
very much of a one-man affair. The
city has required no formal reports
from the police magistrate, and it is
said to have received none. During the
present administration, so far as Po­
lice Commissioner Kirk can recall,
about $100 in fines collected has been
remitted to the city. The only formal
report 'the"city"comnnsslon"receives is
the monthly statement of arrests from
Chief Downing. Thip report for Octo­
ber showed 39 arrests, btit it gave not
the slightest inkling of what happened
to a single one Of the prisoners after
his arrest nor (lid it show that a
single penny had been collected in
fines. The misdemeanors for which the
arrests were made covef-ed everything
from robbery and grand larceny down
to plain and fancy drunkenness, but so
for as the eomnVisHion, or, apparently,
anyone else outside of the police mag­
istrate, and, perhaps, the chief of po­
lice, knew, no coffers were enriched by
this liaul.
Will Investigate.
Police Commissioner Kirk intends to
draw the lines tighter. The word will
be passed today that laws must be en­
forced, regulation? obeyed, or jobs sur­
rendered. Kirk has hesitated to act
until he felt himself in possession of
sufficient evidence, circumstantial' or
otherwise, to warrant taking some
drastic step. He now, has the evidence
and he intends to proceed with all the
firmness which the exigencies of the
case dictate. Heads may fall before
the investigations is complete, but in
the end Bismarck will have the sem­
blance of a police force which gives
some signs of activity in the enforce­
ment of law and order and which does
not hold kan'garoo courts, star cham­
ber sessions nor "get its orders" from
any man higher up.
Poker Raid Fliyver.
Last Saturday night Night Captain
Chris Martineson and Night Officer
Jack Huber at 1:30' a. m. raided a no­
torious joint on the south side on the
complaint of a negro player who claim­
ed he had lost his money in gambling
at the resort, When the officers arrived
everything was serene: no evidence
wa» in sight, except a chip rack, crap
dice, various coins, on the table, 300
or more chips and a number of decks
of cards, and when they attempted
to proceed further with the case they
found that their complining witness
had "reneged." This is one of many
similar instances which Commissioner
Kirk intends to look into. Before he
completes looking things over he ex­
pects to be in a position to announce
whether the blind-piggers and the ele­
ment which is interested in upholding
them is running Bismarck affairs, or
whether the decent people are to have
a chance.
SMALL BUZE IN
N. P. OIL
Mandan. X. D., Nov. 14.—The NJP.
oil house caught fire this morning,
from sparks flying into a can of oiled
waste. Chief of Police Reynolds no­
ticed flames issuing from the build­
ing, and on investigating, discovered
it was burning waste. He called to
the caretaker of the oil house, and
with some assistance they succeed­
ed in quenching the blaze. Gasoline
and oil are kept in the oil house and
a very bad explosion would no doubt
have taken place but for the quick ac­
tion of the two men.

Mandan. Nov. 14.—Oscar A. Hurd,
his day's work done at the Inter
Ocean building, was clearing away his
tools for the evening at
a
o'clock this
afternoon, when without an instant's
warning a foundation wall, under
which he was standing, crumbled,
burying him beneath a heap of rock
and mortar. When a rescuing party
dug down to hipi thirty minutes later,
life was extinct. It is thought that
death was instantaneous. Two com­
panions who- were standing near Hurd
escaped, one with a lacerated leg and
the other without any injuries.

Hurd, 26 years old and married,
came to Mandan on October 24 to en­
ter the apiploy of the Meinicke Con­
struction Co., which has the contract
for remodeling the Inter-Ocean hotel.
He was an excellent workman who had
made many friends duringfhis brief
residence here. A young widow, re­
siding in the Holcomb apartments, and*
a brother, Arthur fiurd, also oft Man-1
dan, survive. The former home of the

The old Inter Ocean hotel is now the
property of Governor L. B. Hanna, who

North Dakota fraternal orders will
greet with pleasure a decision of the
supreme coprt handed down lapt
evening, holding that property owned
and used exclusively by -fraternities
cannot be listed for taxation. The
decision will apply to every fraternal
order in the state which owns lodge
rooms, temple or other real property
used by the lodge or society.
Masons Tested Law.
The case under consideration was
that of The State, ex rel. Henry J.
Linde. attorney general, the Scottish
Rite bodies of Fargo and H. C. Plum
ley versus Frank E. Packard, chair­
man and other members of the North
Dakota tax commission. The pro­
ceeding was originated in the supreme
court in an application for a writ
enjoining the state tax commission
from assessing and listing for taxa­
tion the cathedral or temple which is
the property of the Scottish Rite Ma­
sonic bodies of Fargo, i. e., Enoch
Lodge of Perfection No. 1, A. A. S.
R. Fargo Council Knights Kadosh, A.
A. S. R. No. 1, and Dakota Consistory
No. 1. A. A. S. R.
The building in question was occu­
pied by these and other Masonic or­
ders and also housed the offices of H.
C. Plumley, grand secretary of the
Masonic bodies of North Dakota. Un­
der the direction of the state tax
commission, the temple was listed for
assessment and taxation. The appli­
cation for a' restraining order follow­

Harrassed
Washington, Nov. 14.—The British
reply to the latest American note,
protesting against the trade blacklist,
made public tonight, by the state de
pal tment, denies that rights of neu­
tral traders under' international law,
liave been ruthlessly canceled, defines
the blacklist measures as a municipal,
regulation, plainly concerning only
the British government and British
citizens, and contends that it is de­
signed to shorten the war.
The note fails to meet the Ameri­
can demands that the names of Amer­
ican firms be stricken from the black­
list, but attempts to convince the
state department that, the British po­
sition is just and founded on law.
It leaves open the door for further ne*
gotiation, which is expected to follow.
The note was subscribed, by Vis­
count Grev, the British foreign minis­
ter, and was addressed to and trans­
mitted to Walter Hines Page, the Am­
erican ambassador at London.
Peace is Dealt With.
A part which attracted much offi­
cial notice dealt with the subject of
peace, based on the theory that, one
American contention had been ttoafc
th$rT .eimte^-no-mtilifciry necessity for
i$3fe*'3iackliBt, that it is unnecessary
tor the Allies to prejudice neutral
cotnmorce and that nothing which
happens in distant neutral countrios
can influence the result of the great
conflict.
In its argument, the note points out
(hat German business houses through­
out the world have furthered the
cause of Germany in tho'-wfic, and
have been active agents "for tire dis­
semination German political and
social influence and for Hie purpose
of espionage."
The note is based largely on (be ar­
gument that there is no assumption
by Great Britain of power to inter­
fere with neutral traders, but that
the blacklist is a matter of municipal
law. enjoining British subjects from
trading with persons found to be as­
sisting or rendering service to ene­
mies. It disclaims any intention of
imposing disabilities or penalties on
neutral trade.
Admit Contention of U. S.

ment readily admits the United
States' contention that neutrals have

A letter was received yesterday
