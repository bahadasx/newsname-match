The nrst numh.T of the 1916-17 lec
ture course will bo held In the lllih
School auditorium Fridays night at 8
o'clock when the CliioaKO Orchestral
Choir will give one of their fanioua re
citals. The lyceum courae this year protn
iaea to be one of the beat and moat In
teresting; ever held. Thla la the eighth
year of the aericB of entertainments
and the promises are I Ik) I they will
be as well if not Mtff ntlended thnn
ever before. The Maysvllle uoople
were not long In recognizing the fact
that the best talent that could be so
cured was picked by the Hoard of Kdu
catlon for the numbers and they show
ed their appreciation by attending. The
lyceum course is a great eaucator,
both in music and literature. The
courses are always picked with the
best of care.
The Chicago Orchestral Choir la one
of the largest organizations of Its kind
In the country. It. was organized two
years ago by Hohumlr Kryl, the
world's famous cornetlst, who has ap
peared on the Chautauqua platform in
Maysvllle with his famous bund. This
company is rather unique from the fact
that they play such a number of dif
ferent Instruments. The different In
struments to be used by the company
are the viola, throe violins, cello, has
viol, cornet, clalrnet, french horn,
euphonium, trombone and tuba. A
part of the concert will consist of
ocal numbers, quartets, duets and
olos. Madame Helene Cafarelll, so
prano, will give u number of soios.
The lyceum course this year prom
ises to be very successful and thla ex
cellent number to start it off will
doubtless draw a great number of per
sona. The four weeks old infant of Mr.
ond Mrs. Ernest Walker, that died
Monday night, was buried yesterday
afternoon In the Maysvllle Cemetery.
This company organized by that
groat band loader and cornetlat. Ho
tMimlr Kryl. Is to appear at the High
.School at p. m.
The company Is absolutely unique in
that It la capable of giving a portion
of the program on stringed Instru
ments, with three violini, viola, cello
and bass violin, and another portion
on coronet, clalrnet, French horn,
euphonium, trombone and tuba. There
