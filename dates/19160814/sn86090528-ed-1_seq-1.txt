Old Landmark Goes Up in Smoke Entail

Insured
FIRE DEPARTMENT
CONFINES FLAMES
Many Losses Sustained by Guests Who
Were Unable to Reach Rooms in Face
of Rapid Spread of Fire
Tor the seventh tlmo in the) admin
istration of the present fire thief, the
department was called out to ejttiu
gulsh flanios In the old Royal' hotel.
leased and occupied by Mrs. J. T. Gos-
aett, at tho corner of Fourth and Choc
taw avenue, about 8:30 Saturday night.
The frame structure, containinc
nineteen Bleeping rooms besides par-
, lor, kitchen and dining room, was con
strueted in a manner that made its
prompt destruction imminent and only
by prompt and efficient work on the
part of Chief Gattia and his men were
adjoining properties saved. At one
time it looked as if the fire boys had
the main conflagration stayed while
, there was yet a chance to saye a large
portion of the old building. As it whs
the kitchen, dining rooni, parlor and
several rooms on the first floor show
ed little effects of the fire except from
water.
The proprietor and guests were ig
norant of the fact that the place was
afire until considerable headway had
been gained. Repeated shots coming
from the sheriff's office and shouts of
warning attracted the attention of the
guests on the front veranda, who
stepped around tho corner of the build
ing to see that the fire was ga 'l'iB
rapid headway. Mrs, Gossett, the pro
., prietor, was out driving her new' over
land Car and did not return home until
tho hotel had been practically reduced
to ruins. Her first thought was of her
guests and their belongings and it was
some time afterwards before she real
ized what the fire had meant to her.
Her loss is estimated at' $3,000, oil
which there was but $1,000 insurance.
The building, which was the oldest ho
tel in Chickasha, was the property of
Emmctt Marshall of Gainesville, Tex.,
and was today valued at about $3,000.
On this there was an insurance of
$3,000.
The fire had gained considerable
headway before the fire department
was notified and reached the spot,
it then seemed that it was beyond
control but quick work on the part of
the fire department at one time
brought it to a point which promised
a quick halt but the dry timbers and
the unplastered' walls throughout the
building proved an oasy prey to the
flames which were drawn to all parts
of the house by the draft and caused
the fire to break out in new places.
Adjoining properties were in immedi
ate danger of ignition.
Aside from Mrs. Gossetf " several
boarders were quite heavy losers.
Mr and Mrs. E. E. Wren sustained
losses to the amount of $130 on wear
ing apparel atid bed clothing. L. E.
Schow lost $195 in furniture with mi
nor losses. Mrs. Carpenter, who had
recently arrived to take charge of the
millinery department of the Burr-Burgess
store, lost heavily in wearing ap
parel and a diamond brooch. Mr.
Cakes, connected with the electric
light company, lost everything he had
except the clothes which he wore. Mr.
and Mrs. George Talbert lost quite
heavily. Mr. Munson of the Kress
store was a heavy loser, losing all hv
personal possessions and saving noth
ing but the clothes which he wore at
the time of the fire. Included in his
losses was $30 in cash and a $G3 man
dolin. Others sustained losses.
Personal Effects Saved.
Notwithstanding the rapidity with
which the flames spread in the interior
of the building, the men who were pres
ent did excellent salvage work and
many trunks, furnishings, two pianos,
and other articles of value were res
cued, sometimes at the imminent peril
of those who saved them. Through
the smoke the relief party went
through the rooms of absent guests
picking up everything that was loose
In those portions of the house to which
access vai still possible. In this man
ner the guest? were saved losses
amounting to many hundreds of dol
lars. But others were begvv jokers, some

j losing all their belonging!. Among
- 1 the heaviest losers ero Mr. and Mrs,
Harris, who, although saving most of
the contents of their, rooms on the first
floor, were unable to reach a trunk in
the attic which was filled with cloth
ing, cut glass, china and silverware.
The silverware was saved but the re
maining contents of tho trunk to the
value of about $500 were ruined.
One guest, whose room was gutted
believed that he had lost notes to the
value of $100 but Immediately after the
fire ascended to the second story and
found the' papers Intact in a charred
valise. - , ,

anything.' His avenue of escape being
cut off he descended from the window
by means of sheets.
Other guests, seeing their rooms con
sumed and" flames issuing from the
windows, were happily surprised later
to find that their belongings had been
rescued during their absence or that
the tightly packed contents of burned
trunks or suit cases were Intact or
practically bo.
That the" fire broke out so early in
the evening was considered to be ex
tremely fortunate, as several lives
might have perished had it happened
after the guests had retired. It was
feared for a while that , an invalid
lady had not been able to escape from
her room on the second floor, but this
proved to be without foundation.
Furniture, clothing, wearing apparel
trunks, valises and other articles which
were removed from the building are
now stored at the old Globe store, cor
ner of Chickasha avenue and Fourth
street,' where they may be had by the
owners. Many articles were pilfered
just before and succeeding: "the fire,

Cause Unkonwn.
Due to the fact that the firo had
made considerable headway before the
flames were discovered it is impossible
to determine its cause or place of ori
gin. The concensus of opinion Is that
it originated in one of the rooms up
stairs. Mr. G03siU was in the kitchen
a half hour before the building burned
and stated that there was nothing left
In there that would have been respon
sible for the conflagration. The fact
that the contents of the kitchen, and
I the dining room adjoining were prac
tically freo from damage would lead
to the conviction that this was not the
origin. A carelessly thrown match is
believed to have started it.
How Fire Was Fought.
"The fire had such a headway bo
fore the department arrived that the
place was practically doomed," said
Chief Gattis today.
"We laid four reels of hose and tried
to confine.it to the building that was
burning. There was a good water
pressure.
On Fire Seven Times.
"During my nine years' service on
the fira department this is the seventh
time which we have' responded to ,
alarms from this source. Owing to f
the - condition in which the building
now is it would be better for the City
of Chickasha if it were entirely de
molished. The heaviest fire was in
the north end. It looks as if the fire
originated in the store room adjoining
the kitchen, eating its way up into the
second story where the draft drew U
through the attic. In the attic about
two doien mattresses were stored,
which caused the fire to gain great
headway and make it very difficult to
fight, on account of the fire depart
ment not having sufficient ladders to
handle that kind of fire. To give good
service on this sized buildings the fire
department has need of a sixtyfive
foot aerial ladder truck. This is some
thing that Chickasha needs now and
should get as quickly as possible.
Everything that the city has in the
fire equipment line was in service and
the fire was being played on from all
sides simultaneously, at the same time
guarding adjoining proiierties. The
building on the west was not over
twelve feet from the fire.
"At one time where there was a com
plaint of lack of water pressure sev
eral trunks had fallen on a reel of hose
and cut down the flow."

The fire department reported tlpt a
sufficient pressure was available dur-
ing the fire. Inquiry at the water of-

New York, August 14. Joseph Hari

survey of all sources of food supplies
which could be commandeered in tho
event of a railroad Htrike.

The situation, as it existed after faff .

statement issued by Judge Martin A.
Knapp, chairman of the federal board,
of mediation, late last night as foU
lows: . ,
"After repeated efforts to brlnij

ation and conciliation was today ad
vised by the representatives of tlm
employes that they would not submit
matters in dispute to arbitration ii
any form.
"The employes further stated to tlt
board that they would not arbitrate
their own demands, even if the con
tingent demands of the railroads wer4
withdrawn and also declined to sug
gest any other plan or method of
peaceful settlement of the controversy-.
"They were informed that their (te
