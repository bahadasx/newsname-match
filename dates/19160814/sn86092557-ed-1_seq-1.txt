May Propose Arbitration by
Spccial Board of Arbi
trators.
(By Associated Tress.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14.?Railroad j
managers and brotherhood leadors ,
deadlocked In negotiations which
threatened nation wide rallrond strike, I
today laid their case before Fresldent 1
Wilson.
First came 35 representatives of
the Brotherhoods who conferred with
President Wilson after 10 o'clock.
They were followed by a committee
or managers.
The Brotherhood men went Into the
conference Arm In their determination
not to accept an arbitration under
the Newland's law, which they contend
has always furnished arbitration
with whom* the men did not have an
unprejudiced opportunity.
There were some indication that the
President, recognizing that view,
might propose a special arbitration
before a board of 12 members on
which the Brotherhoods could be rep
,resented.
The President's plan was to appeal
to managers and men on highest patri
otic ground to And a way to compose
their indifferences without a strike.
The first development of the day
was a declaration by A. B. Garretson,
speaking for the Brotherhood, that
the men were through with arbitrat
ing under the Newland's law. Previ
ous arbitrations, ho said, had demon
trated that neutral arbitration held
the balance of power. lie declared
that any special arbitration into
which the men might agree to enter
would have to make provisions to give
tho mon what they considered a fair
chance. Officially he said tho Broth
erhood had not knowledge of Secre
tary Tumulty' flying trip to New York
nor of the message he carried from the
President.
"The chief objection to tho exist
ing form of arbitration on part of the
Brotherhoods," said Mr. Garretson,
"centors on the difficulty that has
been experienced In selecting neu
tral arbitrators who could do Justice
to the cause of the men. No matter
how honest their Intentions they could
not bring to bear tho questions at is
sue. The appointment of neutrals In
tho past under the provisions of the
Newland's act have damned arbitra
tions as to practical proposition in
the minds of the men."
The President's conference with the
men was opened with a statement by
Mr. Garretson, ns spokesman. He out
lined the demand for an eight-hour
day and a time and half for overtime.
Insisting they were fair. President
Wilson then addressed the men, point

Board of Affairs So Decided
at This Morning's
Meeting.
The Board of Affairs meeting this
morning disposed promptly of a num
ber of minor matters concerning pav
ing and sidewalks. A number of peti
tions were received that have not yet
been acted upon and the only now
business of importance was the au
thorizatlon of Commissioner Smith to
buy new fire hydrants wherever need- j
ed after he completes the inspection
of the present hydrants which is now
under way.
The Helmick Foundry Company
through tholr attorney, Frank Hay
mond, presented a petition asking that
the Board annul and vacate Chamber
lin street and Park avenue between
Eighth and Ninth streets. As an in
ducement for this action the compan)
agrees to give the city enough land
above their plant to make a 50 foot
street where a twenty foot alley now
exists. The Board is considering this
proposition.
A petition was received asking that
Robinson street between Bennett and
Billlngslea streets be paved In the
Fourth ward. This is also being con
sidered.
The order was entered for the grad
ing of the sidewalk near C. E. Hutchin
son's residence on Mason street and
on Morgan town and Pittsburgh ave
nues. A sidewalk is also to be built
along Pennsylvania avenue in the
Broadway addition.
