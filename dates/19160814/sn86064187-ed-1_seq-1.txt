NFW YORK. Aug 14 -If President

men and their employers to scttM their
differences and a general strike is

thr four big lailwav brotherhoods ami
the railroad managers reached Wash

of Ihe nation.
At brotherhood headquarters it was
said all preparations have been made
for putting into effect a strike that will
slov rverv train, passrnger and freight
on the 225 railway systems of the Unit

was indicated by the anxiety displayed
in every big industry which will be
rippled by the failure of transporta

The brotherhood leaders prrsmted to
the presidrnt detailed reports of the
vote case in favor of a general strike.
The discussion this morning, it was
learned, centered largely about the,
possibility of reaching an agreement
on some form of arbitration and par
ticular attention was paid to the sub
jects o be ariitraied.
May Urge Submission.
It is considrrrd possible that a ten
tative agrermrnt will br suhmtttrd that
will provide for arbitration of the de-.
mands !of thr men for an -eight-hour
day and for tune and a half for over-
time with the elimination of the coun-

An aggregate of financial losses, run
ning perhaps into hundrrds of mil.

tioti arc some of the possibilities whitll
a strike presents. It is to be remem
bered, business men said, that there is
scarcely a factory of anv importance
which dors not depend on a railroad for

will mean that thr steel mills of Pitts
