BACK ALONG
Last Formidable Barrier to
Lemberg Broken as Slavs
Forge Forward.
GERMANS CANT MAKE STAND
Threatened Ranking Movement
Keeps Gen. Bothmer From
Checking Czar's Army.
PETROGRAD, Aug. 14. The
lMt formidable Austro-German
barrier to Lemberg has been
broken and the Teutonic forces
are making a general retreat on a
ninety-mile front in the direction
of the Galician capital.
Compelled to retire from the
strong Strypa river positions by
the threat that his armies would
be surrounded and captured, Gen
eral Bothmer is falling steadily
back on the Zlota Lipa, eighteen
miles to the west.
But Russian forces already have
crossed the Zlota Lipa north of
Stanislau and the danger of a
blow at his right flank will prevent
Bothmer from making a stand
hare.
CONTINUE ADVANCE.
The war offloe announced todav that
tho Russians continue to advance west

ad that other forces, advancing- weat
werd from the River Korooets'. have
reached a point north of the Dnleater
before Martampol, whoae capture, by
cavalry was announced yeaterday.
At- " o'clock yeaterday morning the
AuatrorQermana attacked Russian do

On the whole line the Russian mowing
machine la reaping; a bloody harvest.
On the front eaat and southeast of
Lemberg alone. It la estimated that
the Auatro-Oermana have lost 75,000
men, or half their effectives. This fact,
it la believed, necessitates the continued
retreat before tne Hussians.
The Russlana are systematically send
In forward their Infantry to pound the
enemy front, while Cossack cavalry at
tacks demoralise the wings. One regi
ment of Orenburgers alone took 2,000
Austro-German prisoners.
The proportion of Germans among
both prisoners and enemy kilted and
wounded la steadily Increasing.
Reserve Exhausted.
This la believed to be due to the fact
that the Auatrlana have practically ex
hausted their reserves and that Ger
man re-enforcements are being brought
up In large numbers to stiffen their
line.

The capture of thla crossing would

who retired from Stanislau and force
them to make a wide detour, constantly
harassed by Russian cavalry.

How possible heavy loss of life in
the villages below the great Lake

was learned today.
Estimates today placed property
loss at half a million.
HINT AT INQUIRY.
Hints at a rigid Investigation and
possible action developed today when
It become known that tho great retain

leaking during the last year.
Shortly before noon yeaterday a
stream of alarming volume began seep

was set. and about 6 o'clock the break
ripped wider and wider until it was
apparent that collapse of the wall was
inevitable.

Dealers Tell of Situation That Would Exist Should

Washington's food supply Is entirely
at the mercy of the railroads!
This Is the consensus of opinion
among; meat and provision men, grocers,
commission merchants and Government
experts today who reviewed the situa
tion and declared that Washington
would be left In a most precarious sit
uation with regard to practically every
food product In cose a general strike
on the railroads was called.
In no particular respect are the food
auppllea of Washington furnished by
any other, means. Is the matter of
bread there would be a fair chance on
eseaplnr-disaster. -The -imm shumiosvi
authorities think, would adluat Itself. A
Meat, green fooda and butter and

railroads. It is believed that . per
cent of the green food could be obtained
from nearby farmers. But that Is re
garded aa an extravagant estimate.
In Precarious Position.
The big situation developed by the
Inquiry Instituted by The Times, le that
the National Capital la in a more pre
carious position regarding preparedness
than any other city of the East. It la
also the opinion that every city would
auffer as the railroads are now carry
ing the bulk of the food auppllea of tho
country.
Washington's poalUon with relation to
the big centers of food supply has been
regarded aa fortunate heretofore be
uuia nf excellent transportation facili
ties. For thla reason none of the dealers
In produce or meata have aitemptea to
keep a large supply on hand. It was a
comparatively easy matter to get meats

notice to the big depots in Chicago,

Conferees on the Dlatrlct bill today

They recognised the difficulty of get

proposition and will leave it until most
of the other questions In disagreement
are disposed of. , .. ...
This was the second meeting of the
conferees. The fact that they decided
to go ahead and try to agree on mat
ters other than the hall and half,
caused the belief that a settlement may
be reached eventually on the half-and-half
question and a bill passed.
The conferees did not d apose of the
Sterling amendment relating to taxa
tion of moneys and credits, nor was the
amendment fixing the price of gas
taken up. The public school Item; were

Basis For Tentative Agreement Between
Trainmen and Employers Understood to
i .
Have Been Laid by
Conference With
TO SEE MANAGERS LATER TODAY
Employes' Representatives Said to Be Will
ing to Arbitrate Demands If Counter
Proposals of Operators Be Left for
Future Consideration.
President Wilson today succeeded in blocking, for the
time being at least, the plans of the railroad brotherhoods
for a nation-wide railroad strike.
After a conference with the President lasting nearly
two hours, the representatives of the railroad employes left
the White House with an understanding that they would
confer again with the Chief Executive after he has had
opportunity to talk with the representatives of the railroads.
The railroad managers will meet the President at 3
o'clock.
From present indications the prsopects of arbitration
are brighter than at any time
a . ......
i New York. Although the
onrleavinPhff-Whife
of their conference with the
White House observed a rigid silence, a basis of arbitration
is understood to have been reached, subject to approval by
the railroads.
According to this report, the' employes will consent to
arbitration provided the railroads withdraw their demand
that their counter proposals be arbitrated along with the
demands of the employes for an eight-hour day and time-and-a-half
overtime pay.
,The representatives of the brotherhoods, it Is stated,
are willing that the counter proposals should be arbitrated
at a later date. Persons in more or less touch with the rail
road managers believe that this compromise will be accept
able. It is also reported that out of today's conferences a
plan will be reached for a spec.iaj kted of arbitration, not
provided for under the Newlands act. .
Under this plan the arbitral board, instead of being
limited to two representatives from each side and two neu
tral persons, will number twelve, in order that all four
brotherhoods may be represented.
CONFERS WITH CONCILIATOR.
Immediately after the conference with
the employes, the President conferred
for a second time with Judge William
L. Chambers of the Federal Board of
Mediation and Conciliation.
Before the employes went to the
White House their attitude was any
thing but optlmistlb regarding the pros
pects of arbitration. At their headquar
ters at the National noiei. mo r w
full of threats that under no circum
stances would arbitration be accepted.
It was a formidable party of labor
leaders that marched to the White
HouseT In addition to the heads of the
four great brotherfcoode. there were
twenty-two repreeentatlves of the em
ploys working on various railroad ays
terns throughout the country. At the
hXS of them atrode Austin B. Carrot
aon. chief of the brotherhood of rail
way conductors, a tall rangy figure.
Wore eDtermlned Look.
Alt of those In the delegation wore a
determined look.
The President was waltltng In the
Green Room on the south aids
main floor, and etood under the portrait
of Andrew Jackson.
He greeted the delegation cordially,
and exptalned briefly that his purpose
waa not to Judge the merita of the con
troveray between the rallroada and their
workers, but to exert every effort to
avert a atrlks the calamltoua nature of
which to the entire country It would be

waved their hats and smiled broadly.
There was a rush on the part of the
newapaper men for Mr. Oarretaon.
"Not a vord." he declared. "The
President Is handling the situation,
and any statement must come from
him."
"Will you see the President again?"
he waa aaked.
"Possibly In fact probably, we
shall." he replied, after a moment's
hesitation.
"Then the negotlatlona are not brok

"Poaitlvely not"
He refused to say any more, ex
cept to add that he and hla colleaguea
would return to their hotel and await
developments.
In the meantime, word had been sent
to the managers, asking them to meet
with the President at 3 o'clock.
At the White House It waa stated
that In all probability the President,
after talking with the managers,
would seek to bring both aides to
gether In a Joint conference. It was
also Indicated that a statement might
be expected from the President about
6 to 6 o'clock.
Invites Unionists First.
Judge W. I Chambers, of the Fed

tion, went to the National Hotel at 6

brotherhoods at once.
When Judgo Ch.imbera arrived the
men were In conference. Judge Cham

aeo the employes and the railway heads
separately.
"The President desires to see the
representatives of the brotherhoods
first for a short conference," said Judge
Chambers.
