The appearnnre of a submarine five

of the water, and It was Impossible
for those on shore to form any Idea
as to tho also of the vessel or to bo

LAWYER UM,
DIVORCED BYWIFE,
WtUSHKS LUVt
First Mrs. Ketchum Accused
Him of Cruelty on Account
of Length of Kisses.
I STHD FOR N HOUR.1
.awyer Has Married Jennie
Maud Kelly, as He An
nounced He Would Do.
To undo what ho thought was tho
greatest mistake he had mndo In life,
Hverett Phoenix Ketchum, wealthy
lawyer and descendant of Puritan
stock, who has said matrimony Is n
crime, secretly married Jennie Maud
Kelly In Now Jersey last Friday. Ml is
Kelly was his first love. On the wit
ness stand last December Ketchum
at tho trial of a separation suit
brought by his first wife, Ada Brown
Ketchum, testified that he should
hare married Miss Kelly.
The first Mrs. Ketchum gave .the
lawyer his opportunity to rcetlfy'the
mistake by secretly divorcing him In
Connecticut. Tho decreo beenmo final
last week, and Ketchum permitted
only two days to otnpso beforo em
barking a second tlmo on tho matri
monial sea. Not even his former law
ycr. Abraham Lovy. know that he
had been divorced and had romar
rlod. Tho ground urged in tho Con
necticut dlvoroo was Intolerable
cruelty, based upon Kotchum's fond
ness for kisses, which his former wlfo
described us soul kisses of an hour's
duration.
Although tho former Mrs. Ketchum
had been proposed to by twenty. llvo
of the wealthiest mon In tho country
before she accopted tho lawyer, and
was considered by Kotchura to bo his
"Heaven sent wife," ho offered no
opposition to tho granting of tho
decree. He was greatly pleased with
tho outcome of tho suit. Tho previous
separation action In tho local courts
wont against him. but a fow months
after Justice Hlunclmrd handed down
tho decision, Kotchum's lawyers bo
gan negotiations for a quiet divorce.
Kotchum had told friends that he
was not a fit subjoct for matrimony,
after his defeat in court, and his Ideas
on tho subject of matrimony were re
flected, he oxplalned, in the following
verse which ho wrote to Mrs. Ketch
um aftor tho second week of their
honeymoon:
"Worn rWw tot U Ml iml cl.itn uimiwt

Tho verso mado tho former Mrs.
Ketchum very angry and led to many
subseqquunt disagreements between
tho couple. Counsel for Mrs. Kotchum
developed tho fact at the trial that
when the lawyer met his first wlfo he
had been paying court to Miss Kelly,
his present wife.
It was brought out that Ketchum
wanted to marry Miss Kelly but un
Inspiration from the Almighty, he
said, dlroctcd him to 'tho arms of
Miss Brown but sho proved not to be
his Ideal.
"Sho Is a creature of aod Al
mighty," said Kotchum. referring to
his wife. "As ono of His creatures I
owe her the same consideration I owe
any other crcaturo of Ood."
Ketchum began to cry on tho wit
ness stand, In a dramatic manner he
aroso from the witness chair mid said:
"I wanted to many Miss Kelly wid
I hope I will somo day."
Michael KoMonberg, present lawyer
for Ketchum. ;ald to-day that the dl.
vorcn had been granted In Mrs. Ket
chum's favor and that thn marrl.igu
to Miss Kelly Kotchum had hoped
would remain a secret. It was pub
lished In Tho World because, tho law
yer said, his client wanted to let the
world know he had undone his mis
take.

According to Sheriff Bartlett nnd
District Attorney Knickerbocker, who
brought King here from Mttlo Valley
In order that he might bo chargod
with tho murder, ho mado up his con
fession In tho hope of being paid
IS.000 and under pron.Iso of getting

have told th otMcluls ho wan prom

Mrs. Orace Humlston, the lawyer,
who hns been ono of the lenders In
tho fight to savo Stlelow from tho
electric chair, and who brought about
King's confession In the presence of
Surrogate I.nrkln and other Catta
raugus officials at Little Valley, ar
rived In Albion this morning In u
state of angry exasperation.
Sho wns unable to get an Interview
with District Attorney Knickerbocker,
oxcept In n few brief words over the
telephone. Sho was not allowed to
see King In tho Jail, nor was David
White, Stlelow's attorney of record.
The only answer Mr. Knickerbocker
would mako to a question as to what
he meant by charging that "question
able means" were usod to get King to
take on himself tho guilt of the double
murder was "I huvn not seen the
statement In which 1 am quoted is
saying that."
Though Justtco of tho Peace Tucker
said an Information charging King
with murdor had been lodged with
him at half-past 7 o'clock last night,
there has been no arraignment. The
under sheriff, acting for Sheriff Bart
lett at the jail, told Mrs. Humlston
nnod Mr. White, in refusing to let
them seo King, that he did not know
whethor King was charged with mur
der or not.
DETECTIVE WHO OOT STIELOW
CONFE83ION IN CASE.
Mrs. Humlston hns settled down for
a determined effort to learn Just how
King came to rotract the confession,
Sho says that as soon as she heard
that Detective Newton, who .extracted
from Stlelow the confession which
started him on his way to tho electric
chair, was "working on" King with
Mr. Knickerbocker, she was certain
that the man would say nearly any
thing that was asked of him.
Mrs. Humlston says sho foals that
the character of the witnesses to
King's statement at Little Valley and
her action In demanding their pres
ence before allowing King to talk Is
sufficient answer to nny churges of
Impropor methods.
According to Sheriff Bartlett, King
began his rotrnctlon In the uutomo

That thn trolley situation Is still fill

an organization, rushed the work of
tubulating their demands and decided
to present thorn to tho otllcluls of tho
New York Hallways Company, the
Third Avenue Hallway Company and
the Union Hallway Company In tho

This action was decided upon to
compel the railway companies to do
business with the union. Chief of tho
demands to be presented this after

In force to, one that will provide a

ROADS LIKELY TO ACCEDE
TO 8-HOUR DAY DEMAND
ir cuiv 8Pe'l from a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHING I ON, Auk. H. Surface Indications following a, two
hour conference at the White House to-day between President Wilson
and the thlrty-four leaders of the railway employees' unions, led to the.
belief that a way may be found through which the demands of the em
ployees can be put before and considered by the railroads without a
nation-wide strike.
't he union leaders were with the president from to.Jo until 12.30
o'clock. The railway uianaKers' committee followed the union men Into
conference, calling at the White House at 3 o'clock. President Wilson
has arranged to meet the union leaders again after he has conferred with
the managers, and at that meeting, late this afternoon, the President will,
t is believed, put forth an arbitration suggestion which the unions,
through their representatives, will promise to consider. The union lead
ers are to confer further with the railroad managers in New York to
morrow. After Introducing tho committee of manaSers to President Wilson.
Judgo Chambers of tho Mediation Bourd said:
"Tho Ice appears to bo molting a llttlo."
Ho added that ho was more hopeful that a strlko coutd be averud
than he was whon ho camo hero from Now York this morning
The union labor leaders wero all smiling when Ihov left' the Whltt
Home. Chief Oarrotson of the Order of Railway Conductor, who had Mt
forth tho sldf of tho employees at great length, was rod of visage and
perspiration had wilted his collar and shirt bosom, but ho appeared
to bo happy.
"Thu nccntlatlons arc now entirely In the President's hands," laid Mr.
narrctson.
Chiefs Ktono of tho Ilnglneers. and !
I of tho Trainmen, said they were
optimistic over the outlook. Tho
union lenders wern much more will
Ing to talk co-operation after leaving
the President than they wern In New
York yesterday, ami It Is anticipated
that the mana-ers will also Incltno
towuid talking things over when they
havo conferred with the Chief Kxeeu
tlve of tho Nation.
PRESIDENT TO USE EVERY EF
FORT IN CRISIS.
Undoubtedly the President will
exert all his personality and all the
authority of his position In an eifort
to bring about an adJu,tmnt of ii.,h
