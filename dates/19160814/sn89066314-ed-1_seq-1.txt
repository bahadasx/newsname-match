County yesterday ami today. In the
last two days more than two and a
half inches of water has fallen.
Heavy rains fell last night and to
day all over Boone County and in most
parts of the state. Many lionoc County
crops were saved by the rain. Xearby
farmers report that although many
vegetables had been lost, tlte rain came
in time to save a great many truck
gardens, practically assuring good
pastures.
Columbia was treated with with 1.34
inches of rainfall. This is the heav
iest rain since May 27, when 1.49 in
ches of rain fell.
The rain was general and heavy in
the northern half of the state, but light
and scattered in the southern part.
The amount of rain over the State
varied from 1 to 2 inches.
The drought in the northern half
was only partly relieved, according to
George Boeder, in charge of the Co
lumbia Weather Bureau. Five inches
of rain would relieve conditions. This
rain penetrated the ground but three
inches.
The rain relieves the hot spell but
does not break it. These rains will
be more frequent after this.
Mr. Uecder said that this July was
the dryest July in the last twenty
eight years, and the hottest forty days
from the latter part of June to Au
gust 13 in the history of the weather
bureau at Columbia, with the excep
tion of the same period in 1901.
Haiti Itclicics Crop Conditions.
"The rain which fell last night will
assure Columbia of many late vegeta
bles that would have been lacking had
the drought lasted," said Bryce Ed
wards, one of the owners of the Sunny
Slope truck farm this morning.
"The late cantaloupes are saved,
and tomatoes, squashes, late corn.
small beets and cucumbers are helped
materially," continued Mr. Kdwards.
"Everything was dying and the veg
etable market would have been very
scarce, but the situation is now
changed. I-ate potatoes, which are
few will be saved, but the greatest
good done by the rain was the fact
that the grass is saved.
"In most parts of this county the
corn will be very poor, but whatever
the late corn does will be due' to the
present showers. More rain will be
welcomed by the truck growers, for
our late products are not yet made."

falling off the trees and stop scalding

ulty of the College of Agriculture say
the rain, although somewhat late, will
help all farm crops.

From two separate sources came re

A wireless operator at Fisher's Is
land said he sighted the submarine
about 1 o'clock off Xantauk Point.
Jt was too far away for him to de
termine its nationality. He was un
able to make the submarine under
stand his wireless nuerry as to her
identity, he said, but the stranger ev
dently had a high-power operator.
whereas those carried by American
submarines are of low power.

WASHIXGTOX, Aug. 14. Every
evidence of confidence was shown
late this afternoon by administration
officials that President Wilson will
succeed in his attempt to prevent the
threatened open war between the rail
roads of the country and the 400,000
employes represented by the big four
brotherhoods.
This was the situation when the
committee representing the managers
of the railroads went into session with
President Wilson at 3 o'clock.
"There will be no strike," one high
government official asserted, but like
others displaying the same optimism
could not offer anything to substan
tiate his belief.
Judge Chambers introduced the
managers to President Wilson and
upon reaching the White House said
to the newspapermen:
"The ice seems to be melting a lit
tle. I feel much better about the situ
ation than when I came down this
morning. I am very optimistic that
the President will be able to accom
plish something. It is unbelievable to
me there will be a strike."
. The cheerfulness shown by the
brotherhood representatives following
the morning conferences with the
President was generally reflected. The
opinion grew that the employe repre
sentatives had indicated to the Presi
dent a willingness to have the issue
arbitrated, providing it were confined
strictly to the question of an 8-hour
day and time and a half for over
time, and that the managers have
indicated perhaps through Judge
Chambers, that they would cease to
insist that their counter-proposals be
considered at the same time.
The railroad managers, twenty in
number, arrived at the White House
at 2:55 o'clock. Xone would make
any comment. The President follow
ed the same procedure with the rail
road men that he did with the em
ployes. Elisha Lee is the spokesman
for the group.

BERLIN', Aug. 14. The repulse
of Russian attacks on practically
every front was announced in the of
ficial statement from the German war
oflice this afternoon. The Austrian
war office statement, made public
here tonight, also reported Teutonic
successes.
The German war office announced
that Russian detachments which cap
tured Monastorzysk, northwest of
Stanisiau. made vain attemnts west
of the town and were repulsed with
great losses. Enemy attacks near
Lull were repulsed.
"On the front of the Arch Duke
Call," said an Austrian official state
ment, "our troops maintained their
positions southeast of Vorochty
against violent enemy attacks, which
failed Hatlv."
Fred Brown Had Simply Cone to Jef
ferson City on a Visit.
Fred Brown, the foster son of Dy
sart Brown of Browns Station, who
has been missing since last Tuesday,
returned to his home today, saying
that he had merely gone to visit
friends in Jefferson City.
Because a horse remained uncalled
for at a local livery stable after the
Columbia Feed and Grain Company
lire last Tuesday night, the rumor
was started that a man had been
burned to death in the fire. It became
known that Fred Brown was missing,
but as he had been seen after the fire.
the supposition that he had been killed
in the fire fell through.
Dysart Brown today refused to
make any statement as to why his son
had left home.
"There has been too much unneces
sary publicity attached to this al
ready," said Mr. Brown. "There was
no need to stir up so much excite
ment over the boy. He had simply
gone to Jefferson City to visit
friends."
Chairmen of the eight county com
mittees cf the Eighth Congressional
district will meet in Boonville at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon to elect
the two committeemen to the State
Democratic Central Committee. A
delegation of Columbia Democrats
is to leave here on the 5:20 a. m. Katy
to attend the meeting and boost the
candidacy of James E. Boggs, circuit
clerk of this county.
D. C. McCIung of Cole County and
Barney Reed of Miller are each seek
ing re-election on the Central Com
mittee and the fourth candidate is
Dr. U M. Gray of Manitou County.
From present indications the meet
ing is likely to be dead-locked over
the election. Of the eight countls.
four Boone, .Moniteau, Cooper and
Morgan have pledged their votes to
Doctor Gray and Mr. Boggs, and there
is a possibility that Hoggs may get
the vote of Osage as well. Of course
the fifth vote would be enough for an
election, but this vote is extremely
uncertain at present.
Assisted by all the Democratic can
didates for state offices Governor .Ma
jor has chosen Mr. Cowgill as chair
man of the State Democratic Cen
tral Committee. His choice will be
voted upon later at the convention
meeting by the different district committeemen.

WASHIXGTOX, Aug. 14. The first
step in the effort of President Wil
son to prevent the threatened tie-up
of the country's railroads ended at
noon today when representatives of
the employes left the White House,
smiling broadly. They had been in
conference with the President an hour
and a half.
"The negotiations are entirely in
tne Presidents hands," said A. B.
Garrctson, spokesman for the em
ployes. He refused to discuss the
situation beyond that. Warren F.
Stone, representative of the Brother
hood of Railroad Engineers, said he
was optimistic.
W. P. Lee of the order of railroad
trainmen said, "It looks very good."
The employes will see the President
again following his talk with the rep
resentatives of the railway managers.
The President spent part of the in
tervening time going over the steno
graphic report of the morning session,
in order to formulate proposals to
make to the managers.
An apparently well authenticated
report that preceded the conclusion of
the morning conference was to the
effect that the employes would agree
to arbitration of the case, provided
me railroads agreed to withdraw

CHICAGO. Aug. 14 A federal in
vestigation of the recent rise in wheat
prices was under way in earnest this
afternoon. United States District At
torney Fleming was assisting the dis
trict attorney in the investigation re
garding the jump in prices. Many big
brokers and freighters are being ques
tioned. The government wants to
know whether a 21-cent rise in wheat
in the past two weeks was due to nat
ural causes or caused by a plan in ad
vance by traders.
In the meantime wheat prices began
declining today. Prices dropped from
one to three cents during the morn
ing session.
Paul Schulze, head of one of the
biggest bakeries in the Middle West,
conferred today with Federal Trade
Commissioner Hurley regarding a
proposed increase in the price of

the price tomorrow if Hurley did not

bakers probably would follow his
lead.
Crackers, rolls and other bakery
products were also due for an ad
vance.

You are ont of the fighting young
