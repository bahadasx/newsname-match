step in the effort of President Wilscn
to prevent the threatened tie-up of the
country's railroads by strike, ended at

and a half.
"The negotiations are entirely in the
president's hands," said A. Bi Garret

refused to discuss the situation be

PARIS, An. 14.—French troops fol
lowed up their successes north of the
Somme yesterday with an advance
south. of the river in sharp fighting
last night.
Southeast of Estrees, French de
tachments captured several trenches
between Fay and the road to Denie
court, widening their positions. On
the front north of the Somme there
was brisk cannonading around the
newly won French positions at Maure
pas.
v^nTne Verdun frorit~'tEe"-Cfermans
attacked three times last night east
of Hill 304 on the west bank of the
Meuse, and In the region of Fleury.
All attacks were repulsed.
The success of the new French
thrust north of the Somme in Satur
day and Sunday's fighting increases
the peril of the German line from
Combles to Peronrie. The capture of
the villages of Maurepas and Clery,
necessary to an advance against Per
onne from the north, is believed cer
tain under the next great French blow
on this front.
The Germans bombarded the French
jjnes around Maarep^L heavily last
night. They are expected to launch
a heavy counter attack to batter in the
wedge thrust into their line and it is
possible this cannonading preceded a
strong infantry attack.

New YORK, Aug. 14.-rHow the five

York will be fed in the event of a rail
road strike is a problem being given
consideration by officials here today..
Joseph J. Hartigan, secretary of
Mayor Mitchel's committee on food
supply, has recommended to Acting
Mayor Frank £«. Dowltng, that action
be taken by the city government to
Prepare against any stoppage of traf
fic in foodstuffs. Hartigan proposes
that survey be made of all sources of
food supply which cortd be command­
eered if the strike IS declared.
With the city in the grip of an in
fantile paralysis epidemic city authori
ties are trying to determine how the
5,250,000 quarts of milk the city con
sumes daily could be brought to the
city in the event of a strike.
Meat packers estimated today that
New York's supply of meat would last
but eight days if the railroads were
tied up.
More than 500,000 tourists are now
in New York it Is estimated. How
these people could be fed to say noth
ing of their being unable to return to
their homes and places of business is
also troubling city officials.
As New York produces practically
no foodstuffs, a strike which would cut
off the city from Its food supply wouid
result in appalling conditions in a
short time, authorities said.

SPOKANE, Washington, Aug. 14.—
Governor Hughes was to face bis first
audience of women voters today. The
republican nominee was scheduled to
expound his views to a "meeting for
women only" this afternoon. It was
expected he would-have something new
to say as to why he favored extension
of the suffrage to feminity. Up to
date, it was pointed out here, the G.
O. P. nominee has refrained from dis
cussing the case of the suffragettes
on its merits. It is said he simply re
garded victory to extend votes to wo
men as inevitable, and felt that in view
of such inevitability the question
should be removed from politics by
immediate adoption by congress of an
enabling resolution permitting submis
sion of a constitutional amendment
for equal franchise to the states. He
has asserted his belief that such an
amendment would carry and in
speeches in Montana—a suffrage state
—has expressed gratification over par
ticipation by women in voting.
In addition to this women's address,
a thing new to Hughes, veteran cam
paigner though he is, the republican
standard bearer was scheduled for
two other talks on his day's program.
He left Spokane at 9:30 following an
automobile parade, for Couer ITAlene,
his only Idaho stop on the present trip
and was to address a mass meeting
there at 11 o'clock. Returning the
governor's plan was to make his "wo

that the Austro-Germane have lost
