Restrict Fishing
At Rogue Mouth
Local fishermen who have watched
steelhead fishing in the upper Rogue
river decline as the commercial fish
erman at the mouth got a firmer
hold on the fish-filled Rogue, are
jubilant over the announcement from
Marshfield that the State Fish and
Game Commission, which heard the
complaint of R. L. Macleay, who was
assaulted on Rogue river by Claud
Barton, declared that a dead line
would be established on the lower
Rogue near the entrance, to allow
the free flow of fish to the upper
river and to aid in eliminating the
constant trouble arising between the
Macleay interests and fishermen who
are operating for the Seaborg con
cern. Governor Withycombe, chairman
of the commission, said he believed
the dead line would be a successful
method of preventing further trouble
and Intimated that fishing beyond
the line towards the sea would be
prohibited. State Game Warden Carl
D. Shoemaker was instructed to visit
Gold Beach and Wedderburn and
will arrive there next Thursday. The
hearing was on Friday and Mr. Shoe
maker will establish the line. It was
believed that the distance from the
bar would be set at about 1,500 feet.
Ships Litbia Water
To Southern Calif.
D. W. Coolldge of Pasadent, Cal.,
who visited the J. R. Casey family
here recently, became a lover of llthla
water, and after leaving for Pasadena
decided he could not get along with
out it. Hence he had Chauncey Stod
dard ship him a case and will have
it on tap In his Pasadena home. Mr.
Coolldge says that there should be a
fine market for llthla water in south
ern California; that the water is dis
tinctive and has made a hit with
every one whom he has offered it to.
The Kruse & Banks shipyards at
Marshfield, operated electrically with
power furnished by the Oregon Power
Company, has secured contracts for

Chas. B. Hughes
Depot August
Word was received today from S.
S. Smith of Medford, member of the
state republican executive committee,
that Chas. B. Hughes will arrive in
Ashland at 4:50 p. m. on Thursday,
July 17, and will speak at the sta
tion here. A record-breaking crowd
Is expected to assemble to hear the
republican candidate for president.
Mr. Hughes will speak for a few min
utes in Medford. The train upon
which he is traveling is No. 15, he
having a special car, and stops for
twenty minutes In this city, thus giv
ing ample time for a brief speech.
No doubt the valley committees will
send a large crowd to Ashland. The
Medford republicans are endeavoring
to make arrangements to have Mr.
Hughes brought up from that city to
Ashland over the paved Pacific High
way by automobile, In which case he
would also probably be shown
through Ashland's park before speak
ing at the depot. But Ashland has
Dr. Ford Has High
Praise for Ashland
Dr. T. B. Ford of Salem, whose
chief laurels In the eyes of the news
papers of the state Is the fact that
he Is chaplain of the State Editorial
Association, and who outside of that
honor, or rather burden, is recognized
as one of the broadest, both in mind
and body, of the Methodist ministers
of the state and holds the superln
tendency of the Salem district and
other honors, has been, in Ashland
for the past week. Dr. Ford came
up from Salem to attend the state
editorial convention, and since he
had been to Crater Lake on other oc
casions and had fallen in love with
Llthla park, preferred to remain in
(Ashland rather than go to the lake
with the newspaper men. He has
become a great booster, for llthla wa
ter and expresses his belief that with
a water cure sanitarium costing
$150,000 or so, Ashland would soon
become a water cure resort of na
tional fame.
"I think your park and, in fact, the
whole city is an earthly paradise,"
stated Mr. Ford. "Between British
Columbia and Los Angeles I know all
the cities on the coast, but none of
them can approach Ashland, in my
mind:" He proclaimed the park and
mineral waters to be an invaluable
asset and expressed his belief that
great things are ahead of Ashland
He left Sunday for Medford, where
he stopped for a day before returning
north.
Ten Per Cent Pear
Loss From Wind
The heavy wind storm and rain of
last Friday did but little damage in
the Ashland district. According to
County Pathologist pate, the loss to
the valley pear crop will amount to
about 10 per cent, much less thaii
was estimated directly following the
storm. The damage was mostly to
young orchards, the older trees not
suffering heavily. In Ashland a few
peaches were blown from the trees,
but apparently the wind did not gain
the velocity which it did in the lower
valley. ,
The Everfresh Food Company of
Sutherlin will handle the fallen pears,
according to announcement made in
Medford, and will pay $16 per ton for
fallen fruit, thus greatly reducing the
loss from this source.
Bosc pears suffered the least of all
the varieties. Anjous and Bartletts
were the chief losers, falling heavy
in some districts.
The storm embraced an area of
fifteen miles about Medford. There
was little wind at Jacksonville owing
to Its protected position.
Many Huckelberries
AtLakeoftheWoods
Reports from Lake of the Woods
denote an unusually big crop of
huckleberries. The "pie nuggets"
will be ripe about August 20 to 25,
and lovers of the best pie under the
sun Bhould go or send a delegate to
gather a few gallons. Lake of the
Woods Is yearly the Meca for several
hundred campers during the time
huckleberries are ripe. There are
several parties already encamped at
the lake.
Will Speak at
17th at 4:50 p.m.
been assured that no matter what
other arrangements are made, Judge
Hughes will speak at the Southern
Pacific station shortly after the ar
rival of the train. Republican ladles
of the city plan to present Mrs.
Hughes with some of the Justly fam
ous Ashland peaches and a case of
llthla water will also be placed upon
the car.
Mr. Hughes io making a fast tour
of the coast and jumps from Portland
to southern Oregon between speeches.
Oregon was the one state of tho
Union which made plainest its prefer
ence for Hughes, nominating him al
though he had requested that his
name be withdrawn from the ballot.
The Hughes party will be accom
panied from Portland by several
members of the state republican cen
tral committee.
Republicans of the upper end of
the valley should turn out en masse
to greet their presidential nominee.
Mayor Returns
From Long Tour
O. H. Johnson and his brother, J.
W. Johnson, of Medford, with their
families, returned Thursday from a
week's automobile trip which took
them to Crater Lake and well over
Into eastern Oregon. They motored
around Klamath Lake, fished every
where that fishing looked likely, and
had a generally pleasant time. They
went about forty miles over into
eastern Oregon, and Mayor Johnson
says he is going back for a good long
stay so that he can visit five lakes
over in that country. He tells of
meeting a couple at Crater Lake who :
told him of the wonderful fishing at
Crescent Lake, which is about twen-!
tfl-five miles off the main traveled
road over in eastern Oregon. Ac
cording to Mr. Johnson's informants,
the 'inosi inexperienced fisherman;
woman or child could catch twenty
to twenty-five rainbow weighing
from one to three pounds in an even
ing's fishing, and an expert's catch
would be measured only by the rapid
ity with which he could take the fish
off the hook.
Mr. Johnson traveled over the road
from Pelican Bay to Crater Lake and
says it is in fine shape, even better
than the road up Rogue river. If
Ashland can get the road to Pelican
Bay open for automobiles a new route
to Crater Lake, which will be the
most beautiful of all, will be opened
up.
Portlanders Get
Fine Steelhead
Portland Telegram: One of the
finest strings of steelheads ever
brought back from the Rogue river
district was brought in yesterday by
E. DeWitt Connell and Dr. R. B.
Brandon.
The fish were caught Monday and
Tuesday in the Rogue river about
thirty miles above Medford, at a
point a short distance above a town
called Trail.
There were twenty of the steel
heads, ranging between ten and eigh
teen Inches in length. Five of them
rai about three pounds in weight and
tlree of them would go around the
elpht-pound mark.
The anglers report that the water
In the Rogue river is unusually cold
for, this season of the year, which
mikes the fish full of fight and fit to
pu: up a great battle, which they did.
they used a No. 4 fly, a professor,
a gray hackle and a royal coachman
in making the catch.
The fish are on exhibition in the
Holcyman hardware windows.

of twenty men at work at the Bailey
hill undergrade crossing in Siskiyou
county, California. A plledrlver Is
at work setting piles preparatory to
tunneling under the railroad. The
tunnel will be finished in about six
weeks, eliminating the two miles of
Jagged rocks which pass for a road
over Bailey hill at present. When
this obstacle is removed most of the
Oregon pleasure seekers will make

Deer Season Opens
At Sunrise Tuesday
The 1916 deer season opens at sun
rise in the morning, and from the
number of red-hatted citizens who
have been departing for the hills to
day, the Blege of Verdun will have
nothing on the opening of the deer
season. Harry Hosier says he has
been busy all day writing out hunting
licenses. Everybody is going to "that
place where I know a big old buck
i holds out" and will be waiting for
hlni in the morning.
E. E. Phipps was one of the lucky
ones who bagged a deer on the open
lng day last year, and will go back
to the same hunting grounds, the
Colestin vicinity, with C. L. McKini'
mey-of the Elkhorn store.
E. R. Greive is going up to Whit-
point to get an early start.
Bill Loomis, Bert Dennis, Pete Ahl
strom and Charley Poley are away up
In the Umpqua river wilds.
A number of camping parties from
here who are out in the hills will
send their men folks out after venl
son.
"Look before shooting" Is the mot
to. But the first two or three days
of the deer season are uneasy ones,
State Rifle Shoot
Postponed to Sept.
The state rifle meet will probably
be held on September 10, Instead of
during August, as had previously
been Intended, according to word re
ceived by members of the local CoaBt
Artillery company.
The reason for tho postponement
of the competition is assigned to
a lack of federal funds, which are be
ing held up by the delay in the pass
age of the army appropriation bill.
No money will be available until the
bill has been approved by congress.
Dallas and Falls City have united
to operate a large rock-crushing

More Guardsmen
Called to the Border
Considerable interest has beeti
aroused among the membership ot
the local CoaBt Artillery company by,
the report that ,25,000 more national
guardsmen had been ordered to the!
border. The troops will go from
Ohio and Kentucky mainly. It Is es
timated that aproxlmately 100,000!
national guardsmen are now on thai
border. The Oregon guard is about
650 short of standard strength and
new recruits are being trained at the)
Clackamas camp and sent to the bor
der as fast as possible. It is not
thought likely that the local company,
will be called upon to go to the bow
der.
The announcement was made along
with the order sending the additional
troops to the border, that no new ex
igency had arisen, the troops which,
are being sent having been ready to
go for some time, and the release ot
many of the guardsmen on the bor
der for various reasons making thd
movement advisable.
Seek U. S. Aid
For Caves Road
It now appears probable that irl
the very near future Grants Pass Is
to have access to the Josephine Coun
ty Caves by a fine government high
way, built to the very entrance of tho'
marble halls. Every pressure Is De
ign brought to bear by the Grants
Pass people on the Interior Depart
ment to have a portion of the first
million of dollars, which will likely
be available this fall by the terms of
the Shackleford bill, appropriated
toward the early construction of tho
road from Grants Pass to the caves.
The Interest of the entire Oregon
delegation has been solicited and as
sured in the appropriation of a por
tion of the funds to the caves road
Drolect. Head Forester Graves, as
well as'the Grants Pans forestry offi
cials, are favorable to the proposi
tion.
An automobile road to Josephine
caves meanB a great deal to Ashland,
since this city Is already becoming a
basis for automobile trips to Crater
Lake and the caves. The end of tho
present road, or the Caves Camp, is
less than two hours by automobile
from Ashland. Many automobile pari
ties have used the Ashland automo
bile camp grounds as headquarters
for trips to the caves and other points
of interest in southern Oregon this,
summer. ,

Give Concert
The Choral Society is planning a
concert to be given at the Vlnlnff
Theatre on August 30 which should
have the patronage of every Ashland-
er. The members of the society,
which has taken such a prominent
part in the musical life of Ashland
during the past year, hope to make
the society a permanent organization.
and of course to do this there must
be funds raised in some way. ThO
concert will be given for this purpose.
Ashland has musical talent of extrar
ordinary ability, and the hit scored
by the Choral Society at Chautauqua
guarantees a performance well worth
hearing at the coming concert.
Have a fit at Orres' tailors.
