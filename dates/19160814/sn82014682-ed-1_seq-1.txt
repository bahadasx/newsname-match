that takfng all things into considera

Patterson, ypu are; examining. Mr.
Brown," Kinney replied. .
Quoting from a letter written by
Kinney, Attorney Patterson; added
that anotuer tharge was that Mrs.
Brown had been too prominent in the
administration of the Waimea school;
that the Browns quarreled before the
pupils, and that Mrs. Brown "com
pletely controls Mr. Brown In all his
actions." ' . , .
Brown told how he and his wife had
taken charge of the Waimea school
five years ago.
"At that time It was run down and
the discipline was poor," he said. "We
promoted To pupils to get things go
ing. I believe that in every way the
school has made creditable progress.
: "We were never notified that our
work was unsatisfactory.! 'In failing
to advance certain pupils we thought
that we were acting in accordance
with the rules of the'department"
Letters were placed on file written
by teachers at the Waimea school and
commending the work of Mr. and Mrs.
Brown. One said: Mrs. Brown has
a kind heart and is willing to help the
children aniT teachers." Brown told
of the circulation of a petition in the
school which was signed by 160 pu

BANK FOR INDIVIDUAL, ,

AFFAIR NOW PLANNED
"I have abandoned the plan of es
tablishing a branch of the Sumitomo
bank In Honolulu," said M. Kawakatsu
today. "Sumitomo will open his own
bank according to the arrangements
that are liow being made. The neces
sary capital for the private bank will
be sent here as soon as I have se-
cured a location for the business."
Kawakatsu is looking for a location
somewhere near the center of the
business district but as yet has been
unable to secure a site. He has been
somewhat delayed on account of the
terms of the territorial law, which
ruled against his establishing a branch
bank.
