Topeka may be forced to re
turn to manufactured gas if the
local gas company accept a prop
osition said to be on its way to
Topeka from John M. Landon,
receiver for the Kansas Natural
Gas company. Statements in
Topeka today were to the effect
that the Kansas Natural receiv
er has offered to cancel its con
tract with the local company.
Acceptance of the offer will
mean a return to manufactured
g-as at higher rates.
Propositions similar to the one
made to Topeka are said to have
been tendered other Kansas gaa
distributing companies. The
action is in retaliation of the
movement against the gas com
panies following the announce
ment of higher rates.
Representatives of the Consumer's
company, the local gas distributing
company, declared this afternoon they
h?d no knowledge of the proposed
Landon offer- If such a move is con
templated no notice has been re
ceived, it was stated. J. G. Treleaven,
receiver for the local gas company,
is spemlinR his vacation in southern
Missouri, it was stated. ?
Kansas City's Plight.
Kansas City, Mo., is to be shut off
from her natural gas supply. That
was the announcement today by Rob
ert Stone, attorney for Kansas Nat
ural Gas company receivers. The ac
tion is to be taken under a clause in
their contract providing that gas shall
be supplied only so long as it itan be
had from the southern Kansas field.
That supply is exhausted. Stone stated,
and the gas which has gone to the
Missouri side is to be turned into the
mains for use of Kansas towns.
Ketaliating under the slap which
politicians and officeholders have tak
en at the gas company. Stone today
indicated that Kansas towns may
hare the fate of Kansas City, Mo. If
the towns Stone included Topeka in
the list do not want natural gac at
the price the gas company will sell
It Oh, very well. The gas will be
shut off. Take it or leave it ulcne.
And in discussing the situation, Stone
laid down the bars for all sorts of
trouble in the future.
W ill Serve Notice Today.
The first step of the gas company in
fighting back at the men who have
agitated public sentiment is in shut
ling off the Kansas City, Mo., supply.
Xotices in the action are to be served
today. The step will be taken by the
gas company under the supply clause
in the franchise.
"Our Kansas City, Mo., contract
provides that gas is to be supplied 83
long as available from the southern
Kansas field," said Stone. "That sup
ply is exhausted. So Kansas City, Mo.,
is to be shut off. That raises a fed
eral question. For the benefit of he
receiver, though, we would have pre
ferred to have shut off the Kansas side
town in order to save ourselves from
persecution by state officials and poli
ticians." By refusing gas to the Missouri
town, the light concerning the right
of the gas company to deny its supply
to patrons will go to the federal courts.
It is probable that action will be taken
immediately following the serving of
final notices. Stone, however, is con
fident the gas company's position will
be upheld in the court.
Watchful Waiting.
.lust now the gas company is sittiner
back patiently awaiting the action of
other towns. Persons in Kansas City.
Kan., Topeka and other towns have
sought to arouse consumers to refuse
to pay their gas bills. The gas conr
pany is awaiting this action. When it
is taken well, buy your coal supply
early. The waather man promises a
severe winter.
"Of course we are net going to shut
off any one who wants gas if he will
make it profitable for us to serve
him," said Stor.e. "But when an indi
vidual or a town doesn't want gas at
a price that leaves us a return on the
investment, they don't have to take it.
Neither do we have to serve them If
they won t pay a reasonable price.
The courts have settled that matter.

Employes Would Quit.
Biggest Problem, To Get Milk
For City Children.
New York, Aug. 14. How he
6, 000.000 people living in Greater New
York would be f ?d In the event of a
railroad strike is a problem being
given consideration by officials here
today. Joseph J. Hartigan, secretary
of Mayor Mitchel's committee on food
supply, has recommended to Acting
Mayor Frank L. Dowling that action
be taken by the city government to
prepare against any stoppage of traf
fic in foodstuffs.
Hartigan proposes that survey be
made of all sources of food supplies
which could be commandeered if the
strike is declared. With the city in
the grip of an infantile paralysis epi
demic, city authorities are trying to
determine how the 2.2 50,000 quarts of
milk the city consumes daily could be
brought to the city in the event of a
strike. Meat packers estimated today
that New York's supply of meat
would last but eight days if the rail
roads were tied up.
500,000 Tourists In N. Y.
More than 500,000 tourists are now
in New York, it is estimated. How
these people could be fed, to say noth
ing of their being unable to return to
their homes and places of business, is
also troubling city officials. As New
York produces practically no food
stuffs, a strike which would cut off
the city from its food supply would
result in appalling conditions in a
short time, authorities said.
Greatest Railroad enter.
Chicago, Aug. 14. A general rail
way strike will throw mure than half
a million men out of work here, ac
cording to conservative estimates
made today.
According to W. G. Bierd, president
of the Chicago & Alton railroad, Chi
cago, the greatest railroad center of
the continent, is unprepared for a
a strike. More than 30.000 cars of
freight pass through Chicago daily, he
estimated, and the confusion shculd
these cars be left at a standstill would
affect the entire nation. In addition
to 100,000 railway men who would
have to walk out if a strike were or
dered, 500,000 other workers would be
affected.
Chicago is the terminus for thirty
nine railroads', having a total mileage
of 01,627 miles, or more than 40 per
cent of the entire mileage of the
United States. Fourteen hundred
miles of belt line encircle the city
one-third of the belt line mileage of
the country. There are more than 100
freight yards and 315 freight receiving
stations. The operation of all these
would be paralyzed.
Milk and Ice Are Shipped In.
Children would be the first here to
feel the affect of a strike. More than
three-fourths of the ice supply and
nine-tenths of the milk supply is ship
ped here by railroad. Bierd declared
he did not believe any attempt would
be made by the government to take
over the roads.
"I have never heard of such a
thing," he said. "If there is such a
project it has never reached me."
He believes a settlement will be
reached through President Wilson.
WHEAT INQUIRY ON
Price of Grain Dropped Three

Bread, Rolls and Crackers
Scheduled to Advance Soon.
Chicago. Aug. 14. A federal inves
tigation of the recent rise in wheat
prices was under way in earnest here
today. The government wants to
know whether a 20 cent rise in wheat
in the past two weeks was due entire
ly to natural causes or whether it was
planned in advance by traders.
Prices Drop Today.
In the meantime, wheat prices be
gan declining today. Prices dropped
from two to three cents during the
morning.
Paul Schultz. head of one of the big
gest bakeries in the middle west, con
ferred today with Federal Trade Com
missioner Edward Hurley regarding a
proposed increase in the price of
bread. Schultz said he would raise the
price tomorrow if Hurley did not in
terpose objections, and that other bak
ers probably would follow his lead.
Crackers, rolls and other bakery
products were also due to advance.
TO ERECT MEMORIAL
FOR THREE SURGEONS
Chicago, Aug. 14. Plans for the
greatest memorial ever erected to
memory of man were launched to
day at a preliminary meeting of
friends of Dr. John B. Murphy.
The memorial is to be in the form
of a medical center erected to the
memory of three great medical
men, John B. Murphy, Nicholas
Senn and Christian Fenger. It is
to cost upwards of $1,000,000 and
is to be financed by subscriptions
from medical and laymen.

Petrograd, Aug. 14. The last for
midable Austro-German barrier to
Lemberg has been broken and the
Teutonic forces are making a general
retreat on a ninety-mile front In the
direction of the Galician capital.
Compelled to retire from the strong
Stripa river positions by the threat
that his armies would be surrounded
and captured. General Bothmer Is
falling steadily back on the Zlota Li pa,
eighteen miles to the west. But Rus
sian forces already have crossed the
Zlota Lipa north of Stanislau and tha
danger of a blow at his right flank
will prevent Bothmer from making a
stand here.
Have Iiost 75,000 Men.
On the whole line the Russian mow
ing machine is reaping a bloody har
vest. On the front east and southeast
of Lemberg alone, it is estimated that
the Austro-Germans have lost 76,000
men, or half their effectives. This
fact, it is believed, necessitates the
continued retreat before the Russians.
The Russians are systematically
sending forward their infantry to
pound the enemy front, while Cossack
cavalry attacks and demoralizes the
wings. One reeiment- rr n,Mnk.,H

southeast of Halltz, is believed to be
pushing toward the Halitz-Stanislau
railway north of the Dnelster. only
three miles away. The capture of this
crossing would cut off a large force of
Austro-Germans who retired from
Stanislau and force them to make a
wide detour, constantly harassed by
nuiiui cavalry.
French Follow Up Advance.
Paris. Auk. 14. French troons fol
lowed up their successes north of the
Somme yesterday with an advance
south of the river in sharp fighting
last night. Southeast of Estrees,
French detachments captured several
trenches between Fay and the road
to Deniecourt, widening their posi
tions. On the front north of the Somme
there was brisk cannonading around
the newly won French positions :-t
Maurepas.
The success or the new French
thrust of the Somme in Saturday and
Sunday s fighting Increases the peril
of the German line from Combles to
Peronne. The capture of the villages
of Maurepas and Clery, necessary to
an advance against Peronne, from the
north, is believed certain under the
next great French blow on this front.
German attacks in the vicinity or
Hill 304 and at Fleury, Verdun sec
tor, were repulsed.
TALK GAS TONIGHT
Topekans Will Hold Meeting
on Capitol Square.
Organize "Protective league"
Against Rate Increase.
Topekans who are not pleased with
the new gas rates have been urged to
meet at the state house tonight to pro
test against the new rates. Governor
Capper, Representative W. A. S. Bird,
Major Harvey and other well known
Kansas politicians will speak.
The meeting is called for the pur
pose of organizing a protective league
to protest against the gas rate in
crease. It Is probable that speakers
will urge drastic action against the
gas company by the public utilities
commission, which has handled vari
ous gas suits during the last five or six
years. Dismissal of the receivership
will also be urged.
A formal protest will probably be
sent to Pittsburg, Pa., where officers
h riirectors of the Kansas Natural
Gas company will hold a meeting
Tuesday. The protest will demand
that the gas company witnaraw its
new rate, which has been established
under a decree from the United States
circuit court, and establish the rates
which Joseph L. Bristow and the pub
lic utilities commission said were just.
WINS BY ONE VOTE
But Guyer Doesn't Concede It, and
Brings Two Suits.
Kansas City, Aug. 14. U. S. Guyer
will file two suits in the supreme
court at Topeka today In an effort to
obtain one more vote in Linn county
and three in Douglas county and to
keep the secretary of state from issu
ing a certificate of nomination to Col.
E. C. Little, who claims the Republi
can nomination for congress from the
Second Kansas district by one vote, it
was announced today.
One of the suits will be in the na
ture of a mandamus proceeding to
compel the county clerk of Linn coun
ty to certify one more vote for him.
Guyer declares his vote in Linn equal
to Little's, who is one in the lead. The
other suit will be an injunction to
keep the secretary of state from issu
ing a certificate to Little because
Guyer asserts in Douglas county he
should have three more votes.

DIES BY ACCIDENT
James Baker, Alleged Jointist
Killed by Undersheriff.
Larimer Stumbled In Chase and
Automatic Discharged.'
BULLET WENT THRU HIS BODY
Died This Morning at Hospital
After Operation.
Coroner's Inquest Called as Re
sult of Shooting.
James Baker, 30 years of age and
an alleged jointist, died at St. Francis
hospital at 4 o'clock this morning
from a bullet wound made by Hugh
Larimer, undersheriff, Sunday after
noon during a raid at the Gray dairy
farm, two miles south of the city.
The shooting was unintentional and
probably accidental, according to eye
witnesses.
"There certainly was no intention
on my part to shoot Jim Baker,"
said Larimer today. "I had plenty
of opportunities to shoot him at close
range if I had wished to do so. No
one can regret the occurrence more
than I do but at. that I do not feel I
have committed any crime. It is too
bad that people put themselves in a
position where such things may hap
pen." Harvey Parsons, chief of police, who
was right, behind Larimer when the
fatal shot was fired, declared today
the shooting was purely accidental.
"Larimer seemed to fall forward
when he went through and over a
hedge fence after Baker," said Par
sons, "and the shot was fired when his
gun hand was almost on the ground.
That accounts for the fact that the
bullet came out much higher than it
entered Baker's body. I didn't know
Baker had been shot. He continued
to run and went half a block after he
was hit. Larimer didn't know he had
been shot. After Larimer fired I saw
him place the gun back in his scab
bard and start after the fleeing
Baker."
Thru His Body,
The bullet passed completely thru
Baker's body, entering the back and
passing through the stomach, severing
small intestines and cutting the renal
artery. Dr. Merrill Lindsay and Dr.
C. R. Silverthome, who attended him.
did not expect Baker to recover at anv
time. Doctor Lindsay stated that his
rugged constitution was the only thing

Baker was supposed to be working

try club. Frequent complaints about

HOW WOMAN VOTERS TO
GET EVEN WITH ENEMIES
Twelve suffrage states elect one
fifth of the electoral college . and
cast one-third of the votes neoes
Bary to elect a president.
In the last five presidential elec
tions not one of these twelve has
gone steadily for any one party.
In 1912, a change of 88 votes
would have made California's elec
toral votes Democratic instead . of
Progressive; 376 votes Wyoming,
and 556 Idaho, Republican instead
of Democratic.
In none of the equal suffrage
states would a change of more than
7.8 per cent of the total vote have
been required to swing the presi
dential election of 1912.
For the congressional elections
the same situation prevails. -
VROOMAN IS HERE
Special Speaker at Democratic
Meeting Tonight.
Former Kansan Is on a Cam.

Frank B. Vrooman of Washington,
D. C, will speak tonight at a special
meeting of the Shawnee County Demo
cratic club. Mr. Vrooman, who is a
former Kansan and a brother of Carl
Vrooman, assistant secretary of agri
culture, came to Topeka today. He
will make a number of speeches In
this state under direction of the Demo
crat national committee.
The Vrooman meeting in Topeka to
night is the first Democrat gathering
since the primaries. Local speakers
will probably make short talks, but
the principal speech will be by the
former Kansan.
Mr. Vrooman formerly live in To
peka, worked on Topeka newspapers,
was associated with Frank P. Mac
Lennan, owner and publisher of the
State Journal, when Mr. MacLennan
published the Emporia Times. Leter
Mr. Vrooman was connected with
the publication of the Kansas City
Times. In Topeka today Mr. Vrooman

of former days and in a measure his

ON TICKET AGAIN?
Miss Lizzie Wooster May Ran
' As An Independent. r.
One More Effort to Defeat Sup
. erintendent Ross. .
IN A 3-CORNERED CONTEST
Present Office Holder Must De
feat Two Now.
Candidacy of Payne Saved Him
From Defeat.
Miss Lizzie Wooster of Salina, re
cently defeated for the Repu blican
nomination for state superintendent cf
public instruction, may become an in
dependent candidate in the November
election. She has been urged to make
the race on an independent ticket and
It Is reported that petitions are soon
to bo circulated In her behalf.
The entrance of Miss Wooster Into
the fight for superintendent will mean
a three-cornered contest In Kansas
The Salina woman's announcement
would bring the same wild, care-free
joy to Superintendent W. D. Ross that
the J. B. Blllard announcement carried
to the Hodges camp in 1914. It was
the former Topeka mayor running on
an independent ticket that put a crimp
in George H. Hodges's ambition to suc
ceed himself as governor. Now it is
apparent that Superintendent Ross
may find it necessary to defeat both a
Democrat and an independent candi
date in the November election after
having won a third nomination in the
Republican primaries.
It Was a Minority Nomination.
Ross was recently renominated for
a third term. He won a minority
nomination in a three cornered pri
mary fight. The candidacy of EH
Payne of Emporia probably saved
Ross from a genuine drubbing at the
hands of the woman candidate. Ross's
friends managed to divide the positive
opposition to the third term candi
dacy in such a manner that he pulled
through for nomination. Now there is
a new brand of trouble for the third
termer.
Since the primaries Miss Wooster
has received numerous letters from
friends in all sections of the state.
These letters have urged her to make
the race for election as an independ
ent candidate. With an unfavorable
expression from more than 50 per cent
of the KepuDiicans who entered the
primaries and with a strong Democrat
candidate in the race, Ross can clone
both eyes and see storm clouds an
proacmng irora tne nortnwest. Both
the Wooster and Payne votes are re
garded by politicians as a positive
anti-Ross expression. That means a
minority support in his own party.
The opposition votes would probably
go to Miss Wooster, who would also
bid for Democrat support. So the ef
forts of Ross to perpetuate himself in
the state house, may not bear final
fruit until next November.

Spokane, Wash.. Aug. 14. Governor
Hughes faced his first audience of wo
men voters today. The Republican
nominee was scheduled to expound
his views to a meeting "for women
only" this afternoon. He told the
ladies why he favored extension of the
suffrage to femininity. Up to date, it
was pointed out here, the G. O. P.
-nominee has refrained from discussing
the case of the suffrage cause on its
merits he has simply referred to the
move to extend votes to women as in
evitable and felt the question should
be removed from politics by immediate
adoption by congress of an enabling
resolution permitting submission oi a
constitutional amendment for equal
franchise to the state. He has assert
ed his belief that such an amendment
would carry, and in speeches in Mon
tana a suffrage state has expressed
gratification over participation of wo
men in voting. In addition to this wo
men's address a thing new for
Hughes, veteran campaigner tho he is
the Republican standard bearer was
scheduled for two other talks on his
day's program.
Side Trip Into Idaho,
He left Spokane at 9:30, following
an automobile parade, for Couer
D'Alene, his only Idaho stop on the
present trip, and addressed a mass
meeting there at 11 o'clock;. Return-
I ing the governor's plan was to make
torium, and tonight address a mass
meeting Jn Spokane's out-of-door am
phitheater. He will leave at 8:45 to
night for Tacoma.
Altho the candidate's voice has now
hardened and gained strength so that
he no longer experiences difficulty ia
speaking, his campaign managers on
the trip are urging the use of sounding
boards at future outdoor meetings.
Hughes started his second week of
campaigning today. In. point of time
he is only one-fifth thru with his pres
ent trip, and in point of mileage, he
has 6,000 miles farther to go. Yester
day was a day of absolute rest for him
and he gained new vim by utter avoid
ance of strenuostty.
Strong for White Vests.
Gibson, the governor's valet, heaved
sigh of relief when Spokane was
reached, because the governor's sup
ply of white vests was rapidly being
depleted. They were all delivered
freahlv laundered todav. Next to his
whiskers, Hughes can be distinguished
by his white vests. He almost never
appears without one. William McKln
ley was the last presidential aspirant
who put the white vest Into politics.
To Messrs. iewie, or iiiiooib, wuu j.
supposed to be "trailing" Hughes on
this trip, endeavoring to sow seeds for
a Democratic harvest, and to Vice
Presidential Candidate Fairbanks,
whom the Republican committee has
announced will trail Lewis, mention
of Hughes's whiskers should prove In
teresting. Today the governor'a were
even more closely trimmed than be
fore. They only half concealed a
mouthful of teeth of which Roosevelt
would be proud. It was noticeable
also that the governor clicks his teeth
together occasionally, a la T. R.
IT GOES TO KNAPP
Nomination For State Auditor
Is Settled at Last.
Dyer Loses by a Plurality of 222
Votes.
Complete returns today from all
counties in Kansas give Fred W.
Knapp of Beloit the Republican nomi
nation for state auditor. Knapp's plu
rality over Dan B. Dyer of Smith Cen
ter Is 222. The vote of Kansas Nation
al Guardsmen at Kagle Pass Is not
included in the returns and may make
a slight change in the plurality.
Reports have been received by J. T.
Botkin, secretary of state, from all of
the 105 counties. These returns give
Knapp a total vote of 37,254. Dan B.
Dyer received 37,032 votes, while
34.723 votes were cast for Frank Or
gan, assistant state auditor. Knapp
was secretary of the Progressive state
committee in 1914 and helped direct
the fight against the Republican state
ticket. He returned to the Republican
party in December, 1915, and in Janu
ary became a candidate for the Re

After hearing the leaders of this
men two hours, the president sent for
the railroad managers for a confer
ence at 3 o'clock this afternoon. How
far whatever progress made at tha
conference with the men can go to

"The negotiations are entirely in th
president's hands," said A. B. Garret

Delegates Optimistic
Warren S. Stone, representative of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive En
gineers, said: ,
I am optimistic.
W. P. L,ee. of the Order of Railway
Trainmen, added:
'T. ..nr., trnni "
An apparently well authenticated
reDort that preceded the conclusion of
the morning conference was to the ef

arbitration of the case, provided th
railroads agreed to withdraw their
counter proposals, and that the rail
road managers had so agreed. Fol

A. B. Garretson, spokesman, said It
made no difference from whom the

however, he declined to answer. Tho
report had spread that the trainmen's
officials were willing to take arbitra
tion on one condition that the presi
dent himself should have the deciding
vote.
Judge Chambers of the mediation
board carried the invitation to the
brotherhood officials at the National
Hotel. The twenty-eight brotherhiod
representatives rode in the street cars
