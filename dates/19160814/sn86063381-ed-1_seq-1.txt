As. a celebration of the closing
of the. baseball seaspn in Bemidji, a
nine-reel comedy was staged at the
new athletic park Sunday afternoon,
members of the Grand Rapids team
taking prominent parts in the pro
duction. Whaling took the leading
part and was well supported by eigth
other members of the company from
the Itasca county metropolis.
Expected Close Game.
A goodly number of fans attended
the contest, anticipating a good
game as the two teams had battled
through a 5 to 4 game earlier in the
season, with Grand Rapids at the
long end of the score. For one in
ning it looked like a real baseball
game but the second inning was a
scene of awful carnage and when the
smoke of battle had cleared away ten
runs had crossed the plate.
The final score was 16 to 5 in
favor of Bemidji.
Bat Around Twice.
In the second inning the entire
Bemidji team, with the exception of
Frank and White, batted twice.
Three more runs were added in the
third and three more in the sixth.
The visitors scored three runs in
the fifth inning and two in the sixth
inning.
C. Bailey got the last hit of the
season and Frank is credited with
the last putout, E. Farrell striking
out. Frank is also credited with
making the last run and also shares
with Diedrich for the last assist in
an attempted double steal when La
Fountain was put out at the plate
while trying to score from third base.

WOMAN ADDRESSES
FARM CLUB MEETING
AT WILL GRAY FARM
Miss Bessie Mi Rowe of the Uni

the members Of the Bemidji Town
ship Farmers' clujb at the Will Gray
farm Saturday, AW. 12.The occa
sion was a regular monthly meeting
at which more than 100 men, women
and children were present. Miss
Rowe spoke OIL "Canning" and gave
many valuable suggestions to the
housewife with-reference to putting
up both fruits and vegetables for the
winter.
Dinner was served out of doors in
the Gray grove neijr the house. After
dinner, talks by members of the club
were given. A. E, Rako was assign
ed the subject of "Taxes" and com
pared Beltrami county with other
counties in this state, showing why
the present rate of taxes was neces
sary in order to carry on the work.
"We are paying high taxes," said
Mr. Rako, "but aren't we getting
something for our money. I think
the progress we are making is worth
the price."
B. M. Gile, high school agricultur
ist, talked on dairying. He said: "I
have visited many farms in this sec
tion during the past month. Some
farmers have been her* fifteen years
and have no more than when they
money and rapid progress. In each
case where the farmer has gotten
ahead I find that he has gone into
dairying to a more or less extent.
Outside of truck gardening near a
good market, I believe dairying is
what a farmer must get into in or
der to make money."
Robert Forslund, one of the suc
cessful corn growing farmers, was
called upon to tell how he does it.
Mr. Forslund told of the work con
nected with corn raising and ad

could go to Mexico to fight.
Private C. G. Bardley, Company I,

Col. Earl Luce, First Minnesota:

About thirty per cent of the Min
