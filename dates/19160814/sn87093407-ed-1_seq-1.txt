United Press Staff Correspondent
PETROGRAD, Aug. 14.—The
Istest formdiable Austro-Ger
man barrier to Lembera has
been broken, and the Teutonic
forces are making a general re
treat on the 90-mlle front In th«
direction of the Galician capl
tal.
Compelled to retire from the
strong Strypa river positions by
the threat that his armies
would be surrounded and cap
tured, Gen. Bothmer is falling
steadily back on the Zlota Llpa,
18 miles to the west. But Rus
sian forces which crossed the
Zlota Llpa north of Stanislau
and the danger of a blow at his
right flank will prevent Both-
mer from making a stand here.
On the whole line, the Russian
mowing machine is reaping a
bloody harvest On the front east
and southeast of alone. It
Is estimated the Austro-Oermans
have lost 75,0ft0 men. or half thetr
effectives. This fact. It Is believed,
necessitates the continued retreat
before the Husslans.
The Russians me systematically
sanding forward their infantry to
pound the enemy front, while the
Cossack cavalry attack* and demor
alizes the wing*. One regiment of
Orenburgers alone took 2.000 Aus
