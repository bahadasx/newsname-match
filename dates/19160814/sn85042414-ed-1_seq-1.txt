Neutral Traveler Says 60,

Died of Hunger.
London, Aug: 14.—The Times pub
lishes an article by a neutral corre
spondent, who was recently In Asia
Minor,- describing the conditions in
Syria. He says:
"The state of the people of. Syria
is past all belief and many hangings
have taken place. They are not ex
actly hanged but are suspended from
a frame with their toes on a stool,
which they often kick from under

"There is a new tej-rorlsatlon of
Arabic-speaking Moslems. It Is esti
mated that from 0O.AOO to 80,000
have died of starvation In northern
Syria
"The process of Turldfylng this
country is being carried out with
great thoroughness. The unfortunate
people who are deported are made to
give up their holdings and the Turk
ish government then sells their land
and promises them that they will
have similar allotments granted to
thein In the north or in Angora. They
are then transported and sent to Sivas
or some simitar town, where they find
the Turkish government has done
with them. This has been the pro
cedure in thousands of cases, and the
depopulation of Syria is fftst^prooeed

NORTH DAKOTA'S
GRAND FORKS, N.
RAVENNA
Goritzla Is only twenty-two miles
from Trieste, the objective
point of the Italian army for more
than a year. Below, General Ca
dorno, Italian oommand-in-chlef.
The taking of Goritza, the "key
stone" of the war on the Italian-Aus
trian front, marks the most import
ant victory of the Italians since the
inception of the war. Trieste being
the objective point of the Italians for
more than a year, and the fight being
centered around this point, and ad
jacent territory for so long a time,
shows that the Italians have Joined in
with the allied offensive with great
force.
Military rfien assert that with Gor
itza now in the hands of the Italians,
the way is open for the conquest of
the entire Austrian peninsula, with
Trieste, Flume and the great Austrian
naval base at Pola-
Ihe topography of the country sur
rounding Goritza lent itself to the
long successful defense of the city
proper, as it is surrounded on all sides
by high mountains. Goritza is in the
basin, and on three sides are these
towering natural defenses. The Italian
advance up these superb natural de
fenses was tedious and slow, and with
seemingly unsurmountable obstacles
to overcome before the summit was
reached.
The so-called Goritza bridgehead
comprised the territory within the
short angle north of the town, and its
stronghold was the long, high, rocky
ridge of Monte Sabotlno, northeast
of the city. Directly opposite Goritza
are the Podgora and Oslavia heights,
the scene of some of the bitterest
fighting of the Italian campaign.
With British Armies In France,
Aug. 14.—Anyone who might think,
from reading the British official re
ports, that the British offensive was
over, would conclude, after a visit
to the field, that a terrific battle was
still in progress, Judging from the
unceasing and enormous volume of
gun fire. No one the Associated
Press correspondent meets at the
front thinks that the offensive Is
over. Though no village or con
siderable frontage of trenches has
been stormed in the last few days,
every day has found some strong
point taken and some new spur of
trenches thrown out in the courire of
the same kind of operation which
follows and precedes each big blow
"The question this week," said a
staff officer, "Is whether our guns
have killed more Germans than their
guns have killed of us, and we know
that the odds are In our favor at least
two, if not three, to one."
For six weeks the British have
maintained a torrent of shell fire,
which German prisoners who have
been at Verdun say surpasses any
thing they endured there while at
the different munitions depots the
piles of shells seem as plentiful as
the day before the grand offensive
began. It has been a week all to the
taste of the gunners. They have had
such an advantage of position over
the Germans as they never had before,
thanks to the possession of Pozleres
ridge, which was crowned by a wind
mill at the highest point, the wooden
structure of which has long since
been blown to splinters by shell Are
and Its stone base cracked Into bits.
Incalcuable and Inconceivable is the
amount of shell fire spent on this
ridge, whose irregular skyline Is ever
changing as a result of the pummel
ing, but the British keep their domin
ation by tactics and methods of forti
fications not permitted to be men
tioned here.
Survivors Surrendered.
The Australians described the
latest German counter attack, which
was made last night, as comic, if the
result had not been so tragic for the
two battalions which made It. Ap
parently the Germans were mostly
recruits. When assembling for the
attaok they were caught by British
howitzer fire, then charged across the
open space, to be caught by both
British gun and machine gun lire.
Some forty survivors, who got to the
trenches held up their hands when
the Australians called them to come
In.
The British guns are screened be
hind the conquered slopes of Posleres
ridge, while from the crest the Brit
ish are able to see all the way to
Bapaume. Thus exposed, the Ger
mans' guns have been gradually re
tiring, for once the British locate a
German battery they go after it with
a concentration of fire like a pack of
hounds after a cornered fox. The
British 'are hammering every village
on the way to Bapaume, and Ba
paume Itself, and at the same time

can put no more spirit Into their
counter attacks."
As some illustration of the power
of artillery lire when the shells are
ample and the guns numerous, it is
estimated that during this last week
the Germans in the Somme battle
area had 15,000 casualties from mor
tar and gun fire alone.
After three days of cooler weather
another heat wave has come. For
four weeks there has been no rain
except a slight shower now and then.
The ground is parched with the
drought and the leaves are beginning
to fall from trees at some places.
One result of the widespread shell
Are over a great depth of the Ger
man front, whether by 12-inch shells
into distant villages or eighteen
pounders into the front line and sup
port trench, is to prevent the Ger
mans from bringing water as well
as food up to the thirsty men penned
up in trenches of burning hot earth
in this fierce August weather. Most
of the villages this side of Baqaume
are filled with debris of houses which
the British shell fire has battered
down.
The thing most noticeable to be
marvelled at is how little ice Is sup*
plied either to the British or the
French army, where it is found only
in hospitals. The common use of ice

Is surprising that the heat prostra

The significant value of innocula
tion to prevent typhoid is shown by
the fact that, despite the heat and
battle, conditions where burying the
dead and sanitation is hard to con
trol, according to the last report
there were only 17 oases in the im
mense army in France.

The feeling that the pmptcM
for averting the strike had bright
ened up was apparent on all bsod%
following the conference with the
86 chiefs of the great brotherhoods.
The brotherhood men declared
the presidents grasp of the litas
tion and the position of the men
might result In an understanding
being reached, and others in touch
with the
conferences
said the rep­
resentatives of the men showed a
disposition to oo-operate to avoid a
final break.
Washington, Aug. 14. Railroad
managers and brotherhood leaders,
dead-locked in the negotiations
which threatened a nation-wide
railroad strike, today laid the case
before President Wilson. First
came the 35 representatives of the
brotherhoods, and they were fol
lowed by a committee of managers.
The brotherhood men entered
the conference firm In their deter
mination not to accept arbitration
under the Xewlands act which they
contend always furnished arbUra
tors before whom the men had no
opportunity. Hie president planned
to appeal to bKh-.sldes an the high
est patriotic grounds to find a set
tlement of the trouble.
The conference was heH In the
Green room of the White House.
On leaving the White House after
a two-hour conference, A. B. Gar
retson of the conductors, the
spokesman for the men, said he
expected to see the president again
later in the day. The railroad man
agers prepared to meet the presi
dent later in the day.
One of the leaders of the four
brotherhoods, leaving the White
House, around which a crowd of
curious people stood all morning,
characterized the conference as
"most encouraging," declaring that
the ''outlook for the prevention of
a general strike is hopefuL"
At the conference, Garreteon out
lined to the president the demands
for an eight-hour day and for time
and a half for over-time, tndmiin
that the demands are fair.
After pointing out the disaster
which would follow a strike
declaring that an agreement
be reached, the president asked tte
specific things on which (he

dent Wilson promised to take up
the demands with the managers in
an effort to find a common ground.
There were some suggestions,'
pnrely informal, emanating from
neither one side nor the other, but
from sources in touch with both,
that the men are regarding the pos
sibility of arbitration with the
president himself as chief arbitra
