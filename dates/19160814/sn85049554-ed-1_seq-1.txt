The president's conference with the

B. Garretson, of the conductors, as
.the spokesman. He outlined the de-
ife stands for an eight hour day and time
and a half for overtime. He insisted
v.V- that the demands were fair.
*""v president Wilson then addressed the
Stamen, pointing out. what disaster would
Ijpfollow a strike, and asking the specific

r-lr. The first development of today was
§«|a declaration by A. B. Garretson, speak
^|4lng for the brotherhoods, that the men
were tbru with the proposition of arbl
•tratlng under the Newlands act. Previ
ous arbitration under that law, he reit
,i'-er}ited, has demonstrated that the neu
if"f" trai arbitrators held the balance of
M^Power. He declared that any specific
'^^arbitration Into which the men might
pagree to enter would have to make pro
N*fvision 4or the extension of those arbi
ft'trators to give the men what they con
sldered a fair chance.

Arbitration Damned.
4 "The chief objection to the existing
ig"-«form of arbitration on the part of the
^^brotherhoods," said Garretson today,
^•^"centers on the difficulty that has been
^^experienced In selecting neutral arbJ
,%%'trators, who will do justice to tihe men.
'In the past there have been neutral ar
bitrators of high standing but no mat
ter how honest their intentions they
could not 'bring to bear on the ques
tion^ at issue the disinterestedness nec
essary.
"The appointments of neutral arbi
trators: in .the past under the Newlands
act have damned arbitration as a prac
tloal proposition in t)he minds of the
men."
1 Managers to 8ea Wilson.
After being .with the president two
hours the representatives of the men
left the White House and Mr. Garret
son said they expected to see the pres
ident again later in the day. Mr. Gar
retson refused to say whether the out
look "was hopeful.
"As long asthe matter Is In Presl
dent ."Wllsoh's hands we will have Ao
'statement to make," said Mr. Garret
sonf
Later It*was arranged that the man
k* agers should see the. president at 1
o'clock this afternoon, and In the
... meantime the president would keep
other Important engagements.
At.the White,Houue It was said no
ipformatlon regarding the progress of
•the conferences could be given.
Situation Most Encouraging.
,•..• ,One of the leaders of the four broth
erhoods characterized the conference
7 ^. with the president as "most encour
aging" and declared the outlook for the
prevention of a general strike wa^
hopeful.
Mr. Garretson, when asked whether
the negotiations were off, replied:
t' "Absolutely not."
Admlslstrdtioh officials expressed
confidence that a strike would be pre
vented.
There were suggestions, purely In

tratlon with the president himself as
chief arbitrator.
Wilson Surprises Men,
The president, according to those
who attended the oonferenoe, showed
a familiarity with the situation that
surprised the men.
"The president was most sym
pathetic," said one of the brotherhood
leaders, "and his surprising knowledge
of the situation may result in an un
derstanding being reached."
The president, it was said, submitted
no counter 'proposition to the men but
he held out hope with a suggestion of
legislation it necessary. It was said
that as a last resort the president
might ask congress for eight-day legis
lation.
The leaders explained their stand
against arbitration, by saying they
were carrying out the wishes- of the 600
delegates who sat with them at the
mediation meetings1.
The brotherhoods' leaders presented
to the president detailed reports of the
vote ca£"t In favor of a general strike.
The discussion this morning. It wm
learned, centered largely about the
possibility of reaching an agreement
on fome form of arbitration. It was
considered possible that a tentative
agreement might be reached on the
demands of the men, with the elimina
tion of counter proposals of the em
ployes.
Nineteen Managers Present.
Shortly after 2 o'clock the managers'
committee at the conclusion of a half
hour conference went to the White
House to meet the president. There
were ninteen managers in the party
and all were silent over the develop
ments of the conference of the men
with the president earlier lnthe day.
After introducing the committee of
managers to the president, Judge
Chambers, of the mediation board,
said:
"The ice appears to be melting a
little." He added that he was more
hopeful that a strike would be avert
ed than he was when he came here
this morning.
iREA PROPOSES OUTSIDE BOARtt.
President of Pennsylvania Lines Fa
vors Disinterested Arbiters.
Portland, Ore., Aug. 14.—Samuel Rea,
president of the Pennsylvania lines,
who Is here today, deolared his belief
that the most practicable way to pre
vent the'Impending strike of railroad
operatives thru out the country would
be. for President Wilson to appoint
a boqrd of arlbtration of dlsinteresed
persons, who would hear all the facts
and then give a decision which should
be made binding by prearrangement
on the railroads and their employes.
"I am opposed to further attempts at
mediation between the interested par
ties." said Mr. Rea. "What Is needed
is arbitration by a board composed
of persons outside the controversy.
"We want to do everything possible
tS avert the threatened strike but it 1»
economically and practically Impossi
ble to grant the demands of the men.
One'-thing is certain, the railroads- will
not be coerced into making conces

of the federal board of mediation ex
plaining the failure to restore peace
between the railroads and their em
ployes, Issued by the board, jiist before
their departure for Washington, fol
lows:
"After repeated efforts to bring about
an arbitration of the pending contro
versy between the railroads and thalr
employes In train and yard service the
United States board of mediation and
conciliation today was advised by the
representatives of the employes that
they would not submit the matters In
dispute to arbitration In any form.
"The employes further stated to tl
board that they would not arbitrate
their own demands, even If the contin
gent demands of the railroads were
withdrawn, and also declined to sug
gest any other plan or method for a
peaceful settlement of the controversy.
"They were informed that their de
cision would be at once made known
to President Wilson and also that the
president claimed the right to a per
sonal interview with both parties be
fore any drastic action was taken. This
request was, of course, granted, and a
large delegation of employes, with a
number of railroad managers, will be In
Washington Monday for a conference
with the president.
"Early In the negotiations the rail
roads had informed the 'board of media
tion and conciliation that they would
accept arbitration."

Italian Drive Continues.
Rome via London, Aug. 14.—Italian
troops continued yesterday pressing
the Austrians back on the Carso
plateau, and east of Hill 212, pierced
another strong line of hostile
entrenchments. About 800 prisoners
were captured by the Italians.
Descriptions of the vigorous Italian
offensive in the vicinity of Gorizia are
coming almost hourly. The Austrians
are resisting obstinately on the San
Gabrlele line and San Marco heights,
but it Is Improbable that this is their
real line of defense as they have a
new point of resistance on the high
plains of Balnslzza, overlooking the
Gorizia plains, which Interfere with the
free movement of Italian troops.
The Austrians, altho badly defeated
at Gorizia, still are strong and full of
fight. General Cadorna's further prog
ress probably will be slow as every
inch of advance is being contested.

New York -Aug. 14.—The epidemic .^f
infantile iparalysis, took a turn for the
better today. The number of new cases

cases and twenty-two fatalities. The
falling off in cases was attributed to
cooler weather.

Anxious Regarding Dan

IF
WILSON FAILS,
STRIKE IS CERTAIN
Brotherhoods Have Plans All Set to
Call Men Out and Tie Up Every
Railroad Line in Country—Managers
and Brotherhoods Blaming Each
Other—Industries From Steel Mills
to Summer Resorts Would Be Hit.
New York, Aug. 14.—If President
Wilson falls In his effort to settle the
differences between the railroads and
their employes and a general strike is
called, it will be directed from head
quarters in this city. This was an
nounced today by the representatives of
the brotherhoods und the managers
now in Washington to confer with the
president.
At brotherhood headquarters it was
said all preparations had been made for
putting into effect a strike that would
stop every train on the 225 railway sys
t'His of the United States. The criti
cal state of affairs was indicated by the
anxiety displayed in every big indus
try which would be crippled by the
strike.
"Unless the president can find a solu
tion it means a strike," said A. B.. Gar
retson, president of the Order of Rail
way Conductors, and official spokesman
of the employes, as he boarded the
train for Washington at midnight.
Each Side Blames Other.
Fiisha Lee, chairman of the confer
ence committee of railroad managers,
who with the eighteen members of his
committee, went to Washington on the
same train that carried the thirty rep
resentatives of tho brotherhood dele
gates, placed the responsibility on the
men for failure of attempts at media-
Mr. Garretson said'that the un-
tion.
bending attitude of the railroad man
agers was to blame for the break.
Authorities here declared that while
the national labor laws gave the pres
ident no right to Interfere the broad
police powers vested in him gave him
authority to put soldiers on the trains
apd even to declare martial law If he
believed, the situation called for such
drastic measures.
Attention was called to the last na
tional railroad strike in 1894, when
President Cleveland used the regular
army to guard locomotives and cars.
Tension in Business Circles.
The tension in business circles here
today showed a realization of the acute
danger of a strike. An aggregate of
financial losses, running, perhaps, into
millions of dollars, idleness and food
prK'fttlon, were among the possibilities
which the strike presented.
It may be remembered, business men
said, that there ia scarcely a factory
which does not depend on the railroads
for its products. A strike would mean
that the steel mills of Pittsburgh would
be cut off from the steel mines In Mich
igan and Wisconsin: the automobile
factories of Michigan from the manu
factured steel of Pittsburgh, and every
industry will be cut off from coal to
feed their furnaces and dynamos.
The large communities which receive
the bulk of their food from long dis
tances would be forced to rely on what
products could be brought in by wagon,
automobile, trolley or vessel.
Other Far-Reaching Effects.
The suspension of the country's ex
ports. the congestion of imports at
coast cities, the stranding of hundreds
of thousands of travelers and summer
resort visitors far from their homes—
these are other possibilltes which the
strike situation presented, to say noth
ing of the effect on railroads themselves
and their employes.
The total capitalization of the rail
roads of the country amounts to more
than J20,000,000,000 and their gross rev
enue has been estimated at more than
$4,000,000,000 on the basis of recent re
ports.
The latest estimates available show
that the railways operate 251,984 miles
of tracks and transport annually 1,033,
679,680 passengers. The passengers cars
have been computed at 51,700 and other
cars at 2,393,808.
KIDNAPING IS FRUSTRATED.
Alleged I. W. W. Leaders Arrested For
Attempt to Steal Boy.
Kinney, Minn., Aug. 14.—Two men
giving the names of L. Burntieh and
Andy Ventiuh, both alleged to be lead
ers in the Industrial Workers of the
World, were arrested here today and
held without ball after, It is charged,
they had attempted to kidnap Mrs. Ed
ward Eno, wife of a deputy sheriff,
and Mrs. Edward Clark, of Virginia,
Minn., and Mrs. Clark's 4-year-old
son.
As the two women and the child
alighted from an electric car last night,
four men appeared. One struck Mrs.
Clark on the head with a club, Inflict
ing a serious scalp wound. Another
grabbed the child and carried It to an
automobile beside the road. Within
five minutes the chief of police and a
dozen deputies were on the trail. The
child was found in a ditch beside the
road unhurt. The two men arrested
were found In the brush near by.

tlon stock license tax to raise approx
imately $20,000,000, elimination of most

proved and an amendment of the pro
posed net profit tax on munitions man*
ufacturers were determined upon by
the democratic senate caucus Sunday
night after a flve-hour stormy debate
on the revenue bllL
Southern and western senators made
a bitter assault upon the finance com
mittee amendment which proposed a
10 per cent tax on the net profit*
manufacturers of insterlais need tw:'
component parts of munitions of war.
It was insisted that It would result in
a heavy tax on cotton and copper en
tering into the manufacture of muni
tions.
An approved, the section relating to
munitions provides that a net profit ot
10 per cent be levied upon manufac
tures of all munitions of war, *nd that
a 5 per cent tax be levied on manu
facturers of materials whloh enter Into

also to make possible elimination of
propowd stamp taxes, against which
a fierce stom was gathering not only In

poration stock tax was decided on.
