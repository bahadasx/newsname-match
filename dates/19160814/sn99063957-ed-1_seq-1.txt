By William Philip Simma.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Petrograd, Aug. 14. The lust formid
able Austro-Germnn barrier to Lemberg
has been broken and the Teutonic forces
are making a general retreat on a 90
mile front in the direction of the Gali
rinn capital.
Compelled to retire from the strong
Strypa river positions by the threat that
his armies would be surrounded and cap
tured, General Bothmer is falling -steadily
back on the Zlota Lipa, IS mi' a to
the west. But Russian forces which
crossed the Zlota Lipa north of Stanis
lnu and the danger of a blow at his
light flank will prevent Bothmer from
making a stand here.
On the whole line the" Russian mowing
machine is reaping; a bloody harvest.
On the front east and southeast of Lem
l'rg alone, it is estimated that the
Austro-Germans have lost 75,000 men,
or half their effectiveness. This fact,
it is believed, necessitates the continued
retreat before the Russians.
The Russians are systematically send
ing forward their infantry to pound the
inemy front, while Cossack cavalry at
tacks and demoralizes the wings. Uiie
Tegiment of Orenburgers alone took
2,nfl0 Austro-Germnn prisoners.
May Out Off One Army.
A Bussian eavnlry force that captur
ed Marianipol, eight miles southeast o'f
Hnlitsi, is believed to be pushing toward
the Halitz-Stanislnu railway north of
the Dniester, only three miles uway. The
capture of ihit crossing would cat ort
e large -force of Austro-Germans who
retired from Stantslau and force them
to make & wide detour, constantly hor
rossed by Bussian cavalry.
The war office announced today that
the Russians continue to advance west
ward in the region of the Strypa and
that other forces advancing westward
tfrrm the Koropetz, have reached a
point north of the Dniester before Mari
nmpol, whose capture by cavalry was
announced yesterday.
At 0 o'clock Sunday morning the
. "stro-Geriiians attacked Russian posi
tions in the Kovel region. The fight
ing was severe in the region of Stoby
chow, west of the Stochod, but the en
emy was driven back .to his old posi
tions by a counter attack.
Along the south, the retreating enemy
'jrees are checking the Russian advanc
from behind fortified positions.
French Gains Important.

Southeast of Estrees, French detach

north of the Somme there was brisk can
nonading around the newly won French

Federal Investigation Begins
, As to Cause of Wheat's
BigJump
OH! TOTJ PIE
Chicago, Aug. 14. Wheat,
flour and bread prices may rise,
but that old American standby,
pie, is safe at five cents a slice
over the lunch counter.
"There will be no increase in
the price of pie," Elmer J.
Case, president of the Case &
Martin Pie company declared to-
day.
Chicago, Aug. 14. A fedcroi investi
gation of the recent rise iu wheat prices
was under way iu earnest here today.
Assistant United States Attorney
Joseph P. Fleming said that big brokers
and traders were being questioned by
District Attorney Cline regarding the
market's jump. The government wants
to know whether a 20 cents rise in
wheat in the past two weeks was due
entirely to natural causes or whether
it was planned in advance by traders.
In the meantime wheat prices began
declining today. Prices dropped from
two to three cents during the morning.
Paul Schulz, head of one of the
gest bakeries in the middle west, con
ferred today with Federal Commission
er Edward Hurley regarding a proposed
increase in price of bread. Schulz said
he would raise th price tomorrow if
Hurley did not interpose objections, and
that other bakers probably would fol
low his lead.
Crackers, rolls and other bakery pro
ducts were also due to advance.

First Talk to Women
.By Perry Arnold
(United Press staff corresiionuent)
Spokane, Wash., Aug. 14. Governor
ungues was to lace his first audience
of women voters today. The republi
can nominee was scheduled to expound
his views to a meeting "for women on
ly" this afternoon. It was expected
he would have something new to say
as to why he favored extension of the
suffrage to feminity. Up to date it
was pointed out here, the G. O. P. nom
inee has refrained from discussing the
case of suffrage on its merits he simp
ly said he regarded victory of the
movement to extend votes to women as
inevitable and felt that in view of
such inevitability, te question should
be removed from politics by immediate
adoption by congress of an enabling
resolution permitting submission of
a constitutional amendment for equal
franchise to the states. He has assert
ed his belief that such an amendment
would carry and iu speeches in Mon
tana a suffrage state has expressed
gratification over participation by
women in voting.
In addition to this women's address
a new thing for Hughes, veteran
campaigner though he is the republi
cs standard bearer was scheduled for
two other talks on his days program.
He left Spokane at 9:30, following an
automobile parade, lor Coeur d'Alene,
his only Idaho stop on the trip, and
was to address a mass meeting there
at 11 o'clock. Returning, the govern
or's plan was to make his "women on
ly" speech at the auditorium, and to
night address a mass meeting in Spo
kane's out of door amphitheatre. He
leaves at -A.t tonight for Tacoma.
New Supply of White Vests
Although the candidate's voice has
now hardened and gamed strength so
that he no longer experiences difficul
ty in speaking, his campaign managers
on the trip are urging ue of sounding
boards at future outdoors. Ir. Dittman
the governor's physician, is particular
ly apprehensive lest his patient strain
his voice tomorrow night in Tacoma 's
amphitheatre ami is trying to provide
a sounding board.
Hughes started his second week of
campaigning today, in point of time
he is only one fifth through with his
present trip and in point of mileage,
he has 0,000 miles farther to go. Yes
terday was a day of absolute rest for
him and he gained new vim by utter
avoidance of strenuosity.
Gibson, the governor's valet, heav
ed a sigh of relief when Spokane was
reached, because the governor's supply
of white vests was rapidly being de
pleted.' They were all delivered fresh
ly lauudried today. Next to his whisk
ers Hughes can be best distinguished
by his white vests. He almost never
appears without one. William McKin-
ley was the last presidential aspirant
wno pur me wime vpsi into pontics.
To Senator Lewis of Illinois, who is
supposed to be "trailing" Hughes on
this trip, endeavoring to sow seeds for
a democratic harvest and Vice Presi
dential Candidate Fairbanks, whom the
republicans have announced will "trail
Lewis," mention of Hughe whiskers
should prove intersting. Today the
governor's were even more closely
trimmed tnan berore. They only halt
conceal a mouthful of teeth of which
Roosevelt would be proud. It was
announced also that the governor
clicks his teeth together occasionally,

White Slaver Confesses to
Ruining 100-Tells Meth
ods of Work
New York, Aug. 14. Movie houses,
in at least two instances, were operated
in New York for the sole purpose of en
trapping young school girls and induc
ing them to lead immoral lives, Yuse
Bo twin "king of the vice trust," told
Assistant District Attorney Smith in a
new confession furnishing more details
of the way white slavers operated.
- By free, admissions and gifts of can
dy, the tsyp movie houses were made
centers into which young girls of the
upper Eust Side Bwarmed at night. Ush
ers introduced male companions to some
of the girls and. made it known that
the proprietors would not object to fer
vent love making in the dark.
' From the movie houses, it was a
quick jump to automobile r'aes and
Broadway resorts or road Louses, (cul
minating in the girls' downfall. "
Botwin confessed that he himself had
caused the ruin of 100 girls.
"I looked over as many as I could
myself," he said. "I bought them can
dy aud before long I had them calling!
me 'daddy' and some of those girls
arter l got em nice jobs in Houses earn
ing good money, go and squeal on me."
Railway Stocks Have
' ? An Upward Trend
New York, Aug. 14. The New York
Evening Sun financial review today
said:
Although transactions in the general
list were restricted to relatively small
totals because of the unwillingness of
speculators to make extended committ
ments pending the outcome of the rail
way laborers' conference in Washing
ton, the movement of market values in
the greater part of the day was in the
direction of a higher range in the rail
way, industrdial and eoppei groups.
Opening prices w.ere nt irregular
changes from Saturday's closing, with
the subsequent early operations on a
movement of market Tulucs which gen
erally tended in the direction of lower
levels.
Early afternoon trading generally was
light in volume but sentiment was more
cheerful regarding the chances of a fa
vorable outcome of the conferences be
tween the president, the railroad man
agers and the workers.
At times in the later operaf'iis mod
erate activity was reported in leading
speculative issues, but Interest lagged
in the rails upon announcement that the
conference of the railrond men with the
president hail been suspended until 3
o 'clock.

Washington, Aug. 14. The issue be
tween the railroads and the men of the
big four brotherhoods threatening to
involve practically all the roads iu the
country in a strike ia now believed to
be approaching settlement. The reprej
sentntives of the railway managers pre
sented their case to President Wilson in
an hour's conference this afternoon,
spending half an hour less at the White
House than the employes' representa
tives had this morning.
Following tho afternoon meeting it
was understood the railway managers
had given the president little indication
of what they would be willing to do to
ward meeting the proposition snid to
have been made by the employes, viz:
that the single question of mi eight hour
day and time and a half for overtime
be arbitrated, all other questions to ue
withheld for future consideration.
The president has placed before the
railrond managers, it was snid "the
case of the public" In the controversy.
It is also bolioved be placed before them
a proposed concession toward arbitra
tion by the employes. In a statement
issued by the president he said ho could
not judge until tomorrow whether a
feasible basis for settlement had been
found. It is believed the managers are
expected to confer probably by tele
phone with the railroad presidents in
New York.
The president will meet with the
presidents in New York overnight.
The president will meet with the em
ployes representatives at 9 o'clock to

PAUL REVERE STUNT
SAVES MANY LIVES
When Great Dam Broke
Mountaineers Rode Ahead
of Flood with Warning
Asheville, N. C, Aug.. IA How pos
sible heavy loss of life in the villages
below the great Lake Toxaway dam was
prevented through- a daring ride of
mountaineers just ahead of the waters
whcTi tke retaining wall broke, was told
today y survivors. The mountaineers
risked death, galloped through the vil
lages telling of the floods that follow-
ea them and warning residents to flee
to the hills. Not a life was lost.
Estimates today placed property loss
at half a million.
Hints nt rigid investigation and pos
sible action developed today when it
became known that the great retaining
wall had been severul times reported
leaking during the past year.
Shortly before uoon Sunday a stream
uf alarming volume began seeping
through the masouary, a watch was set
and about 0 o'clock the break ripped
wider and wider until it was apparent
collapse of the wall was inevitable.
Hardy mountaineer horsemen volun
teered to ride down the valleys, toward
men, womeu and children of the little
hamlets that would be swept. Traveling
short mountain cuts and often risking
their lives by breakneck speed along
narrow nioiuiteiu. side trails, the riders
kept just ahead of the' waters.
HAS TRYAT TARGETS
With Their Families Made a
Picnic of ItSome Fine
Scores Made
Members of the Suleni Rifle club and
their families enjoyed a day's outing
yesterday at the Finzer rifle range.
While the dinner picnic was part of
the day's program, yet the real work
of the day came in trying to hit the
bull's eye with a Krag-Jorgcnsen rifle,
nt distances of from 200 to 000 yards.
, While the general atmospheric con
ditions were not conducive to accurate
shooting, yet fair scores were made.
Those who might be termed the top
notchcrs for tne day were as follows:
Shooting at 200 yards: Gorge Mudge
making a record of 10 out of a pos
sible -); H. IS. Doe with a score ulso
of 1H points; Chester Eraser scoring
14 und Lot L. Penrce with a total of
14 out of a possible 25 points.
' Shooting ut 300 yords: H. B. Doe,
1)1 points out of a possible 2"t; George
Hodge, Bcoring 15 und Chester Eraser
with 18 ont of the possible 25.
Shooting at 500 yards: II. II. Doe,
scoring 19; George Mudge with 15 and
Lot L. Paarue, 12.
Shootiig at 000 yards: Doe, 15; Geo.
C. L. Snyder, 14, and Mudge 11.
Sjrooting will take place every day
this week with the big shoot 'next

NEW YORK WOULD
BE HIT HARDEST
IF STRIKE COMES
Cutting Off Milk Supply of
2,256,000 Quarts Daily
Would Kill Babies
MEAT SUPPLY WOULD BE
USED UP IN EIGHT DAYS
Would Throw Millions Out of
Work Railroads Can Run
Some Trains
New York, Aug. 14. How the five
million people living in Greater New
York will be fed in the event of a rail
road strike is a problem being given
consideration by officials here today.
. Joseph J. Hartigan, secretary of May- '
or Mitchell 's committee on food supply, .
has recommended to Acting Mayor
Frank L. Dowling that action be tak
en by the city government to prepare
against stoppage of traffic in food
stuffs. Hartigan proposes that survey
be made of all sources of food supply
which could be commandeered if the
strike is declared.
With the city in the grip of an infan
tile paralysis epidemic, city authorities
are trying to determine how the s.souv
000 quarts of milk the city consumes
daily could be brought to the city in the
event of a strike. x
iniKut packers estimated today that
New York's supply of meat would last
but eight days il the railroads were tied
up.
More than 500,000 tourists are now tn
Now York, it is estimated. How these
people could be fed, to say nothing of
their being' unable -to return to their .
homes and places o'f business, is also
troubling city officials.
As New York produces practically no
fond stuffs, a strike which would cut
off the city from its food snpnly would
result in appalling conditions in a short
time, authoritiea Bald. '
Would Paralyse Labor. -
Chicago, Aug. 14. A general railway
strike will throw more tnan half a mil
lion men out of work here, according .
to conservative estimaes made today.
According to M. G. Bierd, president of
the Chicago and Alton railroad, Chicago,
the greatest railroad center of the
world, is unprcparod for a strike. Mere
than 30,000 cars of freight pass through.
Chicago daily, he estimated and the
confusion should these cars be left at a
standstill would affect the entire na
tion. In addition to 100,000 railway
men who would have to walk out if a
strike were ordered, 600,000 other work
ers would be affected.
Chicago is the terminus for 39 rail
roads, having a total mileage of 91,627
miles, or more than 40 per cent of the
entire mileage of the United States.
Fourteen- hundred miles of belt line en
circle the city one-third of the belt
lino mileage ot the country. There ar
mors than 100 freight yards and 315
freight receiving -stations.
Clnidie:i Mould be the first here to
feel thu effect of a strike. More than
th-ee fourtlis of the '.-e tnpply and ntn
tentln of the milk supply is shipped
here by railroad.
Bierd declared he did not believe any
attempt would be made by the govern
ment to take over the railroads
"I have never heard of ' euch a
thing," he said. "Tf there is such a
project it has never reached me."
Bierd believes that a settlement will
be reached through President Wilson.
TJ. P. Trainmen Against It.
"Tho Santa Fc, for one, is prepared,"
Storey declared. "We have received
sufficient applications from our adver
tisements in newspapers, in which wa
nsked for men to operate trains in event
of a strike, to supply the demand."
At the same time it waa announced

Mnuuirer Gerrit Fort of the Union Pa
