was expressed in financial circles to
day that within a fortnight official

ran for two years, according to a
summary here today, with interest at

two years and to be offered at 99,
would be obligations of the American
Foreign Securities Company, which
advanced $100,000,000 to France re
cently or of a new corporation with
which the same interests would be

ed, would include deposits of about
$300,000,000 of Canadian, Argentine,
and Swiss government bonds and
stocks and bonds of American rail
road and industrial corporations, and
principal and interest would be pay
able in gold in New York. As in the
case of the French loan, the proposed
loan to Great Britain would be dis
tributed among banks and the public
by debenture notes.
The main purpose of such a loan is
said to be to provide funds for pay
ment for munitions purchased in the
United States.

DR.
ELDRIDGE D. ATWOOD
INDICTED FOR MURDER
For Shooting Dr. Wilfred E. Harris
in Eoston, July 18.
Boston, Aug. 12. Dr. Eldridge D.
Atwood, the osteopath, who shot and
fatally wounded Dr. Wilfred E. Har
ris, president of the Massachusetts
College of Osteopathy, is accused of
murder in the first degree in an in
dictment returned yesterday.
Atwood entered the offices of Dr.
Harris in the Westminster hotel on
the afternoon of July IS and shot his
former friend and instructor three
times. Harris died a week later. Just
before the shooting occurred Atwood
had learned of the death of his fiancv,
Dr. Celia P. Adams from poisoning,
apparently self administered. Dr.
Adams, also an osteopath, had stud
ied under Harris.
When arrested Atwood told the po
lice that Dr. Adams had admitted an
intimacy with Harris that made her
promised marriage impossible. lie
made his attack, he said, when he dis
covered that his sweetheart had com
mitte dsuicide, because, he believed,
she was unable to escape the influ
ence of the older man.
The 'case has elements of mvsterv
that the police have not been able to
clear up. So far as known thev have
discovered little or nothing regarding
the relations of the three phvsicians;
or a motive for the killing other than
that given by the slayer.
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS ON
$200,000,000 REVENUE BILL
Appropriations
by Congress
Breaks
All Records.
Washington, Aug. 13. The import
ance of the $200,000,000 revenue bill
on which senate democrats today de
voted many hours of deliberation in
caucus is being impressed upon lead
ers by the fact that appropriations of
the session now nearing completion
have broken all records.
With passage this week of the $50 -000,000
ship purchase bill and probable
approval by the house of the senate's
gigantic naval bill, the appropriations
of the sixty-fourth congress will have
exceeded the previous high record by
at least a half a billion dollars. While
exact figures cannot be computed un
til the gavel has fallen on the last
supply bill of the session the aggre
gate appropriation by congress for all
purposes probably will approximate
$1,700,000,000 as against $1,114,000,000
for the sixty-third congress.

Opens This Week
PRESIDENT WILSON AND NOM
INEE HUGHES TO PARTICIPATE
ELECTION ON SEPT. 11
Leaders of Both Parties Look on This
Contest as of Importance as a Polit
ical lndex--Roosevelt to Make an
Address.
Portland, Me., August 13. The
present week will see the opening of
the speech making acmpaign among
Maine voters in preparation for the
state election on September 11. As
there will be no itest of strength be
tween democrats and republicans in
other states prior to November 7,
leaders of both parties look on this
contest as of importance as a polit
ical index.
Wilson and Hughes to Stump.
Both President Wilson and Former
Justice Hughes are expected to plead
for thei rown support as candidates.
Former President Roosevelt will de
liver at least one address in behalf of
Mr. Hughes.
Although the progressive party will
have no candidates in the field, the
trend of individual progressive senti
ment is regarded as the most inter
esting factor in the situation, with
leaders on both sides professing con
fidence that they will obtain the bulk
of these votes. Until the progressive
republican split of 1912 the state was
rated as republican and notwithstand
ing a democratic victory for governor
and legislature in 1910, which was ac
counted for largely by a fight over
local issues, party managers were ac
customed to scan the returns mainly
to determine the size of the republican
plurality.
Republicans Won Four Years Ago.
Four years ago the republicans were
successful in the vote for governor at
the September election, but the margin
was small and in the following No
vember the state went for Wilson for
president with Colonel Roosevelt as
second choice. In 1914 Governor
William T. Haines, republican, was de
feated for re-election by Oakley C.
Curtis, democrat, with a progressive
candidate also in the field. The
progressive vote in that year was a
little over one-third that returned for
Roosevelt two years before.
In addition to the state officers and
congressmen, two United States sen
ators are to be chosen this year for
the first time in the state by direct
vote.
DROWNED WHILE TRYING
TO RESCUE SMALL BOY.
Charles A. Mellen of New Britain Was
Seized With Cramps.
Branford, Conn., August 13. Charles
A. Mellen of New Britain was
drowned in Long Island sound late to

and child were cruising off Rockland
Point in a 20 foot launch. The sea

amidships, the shock throwing Mrs.
Eldredge and her son into the water.
Mrs. Eldredge who is a fair swimmer,
started for the launch, holding her
son's head above water. Mr. Meilen,
who had just recovered from an ill
ness, jumped into the water and went
to their assistance. Mrs. lildrodge
shouted for Mellen to take the clild;
that she could swim to the boat. As
she was being pulled aboard the craft,
Mellen apparently, was seized with
cramps and sank with the child.
Up to a late hour tonight neither
body had been recovered. Mrs. Mellen
collapsed, and was taken to a New
Haven hospital. The Mellen and
Eldredge families were spending the
day nt the Remington cottage at

diately threatened and warnings were
telephoned to all places that could be

Matter Laid Before the House After the Trainmen Hat
Flatly Rejected Any Form of Arbitration
LEADERS OF BROTHERHOOD GO TO WASMNGT0IS
Both the Railroad Managers and the Employes Will Read:
Washington Today in Time for an Early Conferenc
With President Wilson Federal Board of Mediatior
and Conciliation Failed in Effort to Have the Trainmer
Accept Any Form of Arbitration Whole Controversy
Now Before President Wilson at His Own Invitation.
New York, Aug. 13. A general strike
on virtually all the railroads of the
nation, paralyzing commerce and
throwing approximately 2,000,000 out
of employment, can be averted only
through the good offices of President
Wilson asa result of today's develop
ments in the dispute over the men's
demands for an eight hour day and
time and a half for overtime. The
controversy was laid before the presi
dent at his invitation, after the work
ers had flatly rejected any form of
arbitration. They had refused media
tion yesterday.
Leaders Going to Washington.
Soon after accepting the president's
summons, extended through the fed
eral board of mediation and concilia
tion, the men announced -.hat the
leaders of the four railroad brother
hoods would leave for Washington at
midnight, accompanied by thirty of the
six hundred delegates assembled here.
An hour later the railroad managers,
nineteen in number, said they would
leave for the capital at the same time.
Both parties will reach Washing'ton
tomorrow in time for an early confer
ence with the president. The hour
for the meeting will be arranged by
Secretary Tumulty, who as Mr. Wil
son's representative arrived here at 9
o'clock tonight.
Communication from President Wilson.
Mr. Tumulty brought with him a
communication from President Wilson
addressed to the brotherhoods and the
railroad managers, pointing out that
such . a paralysis of business as would
follow a general railroad strike would
create a tremendous sensation and
would be nothing short of a disband
ment of present business. He bases
his request for a conference with rep
resentatives of both factions before a
strike order is issued by the leaders of
the men.
Declined to Arbitrate.
Negotiations had not been broken off
when Mr. Tumulty left Washington,
but when he reached Philadelphia he
received a telegram from V. L. Cham
bers, one of the mediators, informing
him the men had declined to arbitrate.
Mr. Tumulty's first step after reaching
this city was to call President Wilson
on the long distance 'phone to deside
on an hour for the fateful conference
at the White House tomorrow. The
final break came late today after the
men had been in secret session nearly
CLEVELAND MILK WAGON
DRIVERS SETTLE STRIKE.
Accepted Propositions of Mayor Harry
L. Davis.
Cleveland, O., Aug. 13. The strike
of the milk wagon drivers ended late
today when the tentative propositions
of Mayor Harry L. Davis, State Media
tor George F. Miles and C. H. May
hugh, representatives of the union and
officers of the milk companies, were
accepted. James Thwing, president of
the drivers' union, who signed the
agreement with officers of the milk
concerns, declared it a signal victory
for organized labor.
By the terms of the agreement the
men will receive advances amounting
to $10 a montn, and the union is rec
ognized. Employers succeeded in ob
taining an abrogation of the closed
shop clause, but they do bind them
selves to make no terms with indi
vidual employes that are at variance
wi'h the terms the union has agreed to
accept. The strike started last Thurs
day night, spreading rapidly until
about 90 per cent, of the city's milk
supply was tied up.

HEAVY PENALTY FOR
ILLICIT LIQUOR SALES
A Girard. Ala., Man Fined $2,500 With
Three Year Sentence.
Girard, Ala., Aug. 13. Destruction
of thousands of dollars worth of li
quors went steadily on yesterday in
the campaign to enforce the prohibi
tion laws despite judicial complica
tions, and meanwhile tho courts were
busy.
C. C. Phelps was fined $2,500 and
sentenced to three years in prison,
Benjamin Edwards was fitted a like
sum and sentenced to thirty months.
Portions of tho prison term will be re
mitted if the men promise not to vio
uia la.w as:ain.
six hours.
Reports differ as to the reason fo
the failure of the negotiations in vie
of the cheerful outlook that obtained
the night before. Tho men assertei
they refused arbitration because th'
railroads insisted on arbitrating, thei
"contingent proposition." The boar
of mediators in a statement tonign
declared, however, the men rejectee
their proposition, contending that the;
would not arbitrate even if the rail
roads waived the contingent proposi,
tion. The statement of the. mediators
issued by Judge Martin A. Knapp
chairman of the board, just befori
their departure for Washington, fol
lows :
Statement of Mediators. ;
"After repeated efforts to brinj
about an arbitration of the pendini
controversy between the railroads ani
their employes in train and yard ser
vice, the United States board of me
diation and conciliation was today ad
vised by the representatives of thi
employes that they would not eubmi
the matters in dispute to arbitration 1
any form.
"The employes further stated to thl
board that they would not arbitiaa
their own demands even if the coni
tingent demands of the railroads werj
withdrawn, and also declined to sua
gest any other plan or method for
peaceful settlement of the oontroversj
"They were informed that their dei
cision would at once be made know!
to President Wilson and also that tin
president claimed the right to a petf
sonal interview with both parties ba
fore any drastic action was takefl
This action was, of course, granted an
a large delegation of employes with I
number of railroad managers will 'b
in Washington Monday for a confei
ence with the president.
"Early in the negotiations the raify
roads had informed the board of met
diation and conciliation that the!
would accept arbitration."
Objection to Arbitration.
The chief objection of the men t
arbitrating the railroads' "contingent
proposition" lay in their contentior
that the proposal entailed the wiping
out of double compensatio nfeatures
which the men have gained during
thirty years of effort. The railroads
have contended that double compen
sation, together with , the demands or
the men, if granted, would increasf
the wages of many of their employe
more than 100 per cent.
PINCHOT SENDS PROTEST
TO SECRETARY LAN I
Against the Pending Phelan Oil Land
Amendment.
Washington, Aug. 13. Gifford Pin
chot, former chief of the forest service,
today sent to Secretary Lane of the
interior department an opinion lettex
declaring the secretary had abandonee
the conservation of policies and despite
a recent denial is exercising his influ
ence in favor of the pending Phelar
oil land amendment, which would open
up the western oil reserves set aside
for the navy. If this legislation is en
acted, wrote Mr. Pinchot, the oil land
reserves set aside for the navy will be
destroyed. The mere threat of Its
passage has caused the navy depart
ment to seriously consider the sta
bility of abandoning the policy of con
struction of oil-burning ships. Without
them no navy can even be second
class.
