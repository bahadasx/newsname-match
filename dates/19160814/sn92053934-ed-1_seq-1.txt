Guy O'Brien
Caught;Shot
His Fiancee
Morris, 111., Aug. 14. Guy O'Brien,
a wealthy young farmer, who shot and
perhaps fatally wounded his sweet
heart. Miss Ida Torkelson, while she
was riding with her mother here last
Wednesday, was captured early todav
near Lee, 111.
O'Brien was suffering from lumper
when caught. He haul successfully
eluded a posse of farmers and deputv
sheriffs since the shootinp. The youth
appeared at his uncle's home at Lee,
III., last Thursday night and at the
point of a ptin demanded a change of
clothing He then fled to points north
of Lee.
Miss Torkelson, who was shot twice,
is in a hospital here, but is not expect
ed to live. She was enpaped to O'Brien
but the engagement was broken at the
request of her mother because of
O'Brien's alleged temper .
O'Brien charged her with receiving
the attentions of other men and while
she and her mother were driving to
Morris, he overtook them in his motor
car. When Miss Torkelson refused to
pet into the car with him, O'Brien
tired two bullets Into her body.
OT?rien was caupht by a posse head
ed by Mayor F. M. Makestadt of Lee.
As soon as the crowd in the city
learned the fugitive had been captured,
threats of lynching spread. The may
or, noting the temper of the crowd, im
mediately authorized the announce
ment that O'Brien had not' been cap
tured and that the prisoner was anoth
er man. The citizens were thus
quieted and during the early morning
the mayor took his prisoner to York
ville, the sent of Kendall county.
The condition of Miss Torkelson is
so precarious that, she has not been
told of O'Brien's capture.
O'Brien told the authorities he wars
sorry and hajl planned to give him
self up. Relatives of the wounded girl.
all of whom are prominent and
wealthy, had offered a reward of $500
for the youth's capture.

LITTLE INTERNAL
STRIFE IN INDIA
Dispatch From Simla Declares Rest
less Borderland is Quieter
Than For Years.
London, Aug. 14, via Ottawa. "In
ternal conditions in India, save in
portions of Bengal where the Dacoi
ties periodically break out, are highly
satisfactory," says a Router dispatch
from Simla.
"The people of Bengal showed their
desire to help in the war by organiz
ing a stationary field hospital. After
doing excellent work, this hospital has
now been withdrawn, but scope for the
national and patriotic aspirations of
the Bengalis has been afforded by the
raising of a double company of them.
It will bo trained and sent to the front
for active operations. The result of
this experiment will be watched with
interest. Besides the Bengalis, three
double companies of Indian Christians
recruited from the Punjab have re
cently been raised and are doing well.
"No less than six Indian officers and
soldiers have now earned the Vic
toria cross ami twenty-seven have
gained the military cross.
"All classes of creeds throughout
tho entire country held intercession
services Aug. 4, praying in the
churches, mosques and temples for
success for the British armies.
"Relations between the governments
of India and Afghanistan continue to
be of the friendliest character and the
latter is scrupulously maintaining an
attitude of neutrality which was prom
ised at the beginning of the war and
subsequently reaffirmed.
"Tho Afridis, the strongest and most
important tribe, has remained staunch
throughout, thereby setting an exam
ple of loyalty to their neighbors. The
only troublesome factors are the Mah
suds, a tribe of heriditary robbers and
raiders. Otherwise the restless bor
derland is quieter than it has been for
many years."

RAILROAD HEAD
FOR ARBITRATION
Declares Belief Wilson Shonld Appoint
Board to Settle Crisis Can ot
Grant Demands.
Portland, Ore., Aug. 14. Samuel
Rea, president of the Pennsylvania
lines, who is here today, declared his
belief that the most practical way to
prevent the impending railroad strike
would be for President Wilson to ap
point a board of arbtration, composed
of disinterested persons, who should
hear all the facts and then give a de
cision which should be made binding
by prearrangement of the railroads
and their employes.
"I am opposed to further attempts
at mediation between the interested
parties," said Mr. Rea. "What is need
ed is arbitration by a board composed
of persons outside the controversy.
"We want to do everything possible
to avert the threatened, strike but it is
economically and practically impos
sible to grant the demands of the men.
One thing is certain, the railroads will
not be coerced into making conces
sions." MUNRO WILL BEGIN

HOPES FOR EARLY END
Appeals to the Patriotism of
Men and Urges Quick
Settlement of Crisis. '
Washington, Anjr. II. Pros
pcr.ls tor averting a nation-wide
railway strike or at leat for the
formulation of some tentative pro
gram which will be the ground
work for further negotiations,
brightened up today after Presi
dent Wilson had conferred with 3.
chiefs of the great brotherhoods.
After the conference, the broth
erhood men declared the presi
dent's grasp of the situation and
the position of the men might re
sult in an understanding liefng
reached and others in touch with
the conference said the repicscu
lathes of the men showed a dis
position to cooperate to avoid a
strike.
After hearing the leaders of the men
two hours, the president sent for the '
managers for a conference at 3 o'clock
this afternoon.
"The president was most sympathet
ic," said one of the brotherhood lead
ers, "and his surprising knowledge of
J the situation and of our position may
result in an understanding being
reached."
The president, it was said, submit
ted no counter proposition to the men
but held out hope for an adjustment
by legislation If "necessary.
The impression prevailed among the
brotherhoods' leaders that as a last
resort the president might ask con
gress for f ight-hour day legislation.
The leaders explained to the presi
dent their stand against arbitration by
saying that they were carrying out tho
wishes of the COO delegates who sat
with them at their meeting with the
federal mediators.
Tho brotherhoods' leaders present
ed to the president detailed reports of
the vote catt in favor of a general
strike.
Lay Caso llefore Executive
Railroad managers and brotherhood
leaders, deadlocked in negotiations
which threaten a nation wide railroad
strike, today laid their case before
President Wilson.
First came 35 representatives of the
brotherhoods, who conferred with the
president shortly after 10 o'clock.
They were followed by the committee
of managers.
The brotherhood men went Into the
conference firm in their determination
not to accept an arbitration under the
Newlands act.
There were some indications that the
president might propose a special ar
bitration board of 12 members, on
which the four great brotherhoods
could be represented.
The president's plan was to appeal
to managers and men on the highest
patriotic grounds to find a way to corn
pose their differences without a strike.
Through Willi Newlands Act.
Before the conferences were held,
A. B. Garretson. speaking for tho
brotherhocKls, declared that the men
were through with arbitration under
the Newiands act. Previous arbitra
tions under that law, ho reiterated, had
demonstrated that the neutral arbitra
tors held tho balance of power. Ho
said any special arbitration Into
which the men might agree to enter,
would have to make provision for an
extension of those arbitrators to pivo
the men what they consider a lair
chance.
"The chief objec tion to the existing
form of arbitration of the part of tno
brotherhoods," said Garretson today,
"centers of tho ditliculty that has been
expected in selecting neutral arbitra
tors who could do justice to the cause
of the men. In the past there havs
been neutral arbitrators of high land
ing and intelligence; such men as John
H. Flnley of New York and Seth Ixw.
former mayor. No matter how honest
their intentions they could ru bring to
bear on the questions at issue the dis
interestedness necessarv.
Neutrals Influenced, Claim.
Fin ley's future relics entirely on the
direc tion of corporate influenc es, while
Low, although honest, was surHy In
fluenced by the fact that he !s a large
owner of stocks and bonds.
"The appointments of neutral arbi
trators In the past under the provisions
of the Newlands act. have damned arbi
tration as a practical proposition in
the minds of tht men."
W. L. Chambers, of the federal medi
