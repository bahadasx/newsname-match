oftener. 7;' ' ' v ' .
The Springs was a lively place yes
terday afternoon. After three o'clock,
the sun goes over behind the trees,
the shade of which covers the beach
and with the constant breeze makes it
a delightfully cool place. About half
the people in town who own , cars
were out there, scores in the water
and others looking on. Ed. Carml

long felt want and he is likely to have
to enlarge it before next- summer.
The roof of the old pavilion has been
removed in the last week and the new
one- will soon be ready. - '
Transportation remains the "great
drawback to reaching the springs for
those of our people who do not own
cars. The fare in the autoes for hire,
while as low as the drivers can make
it, is prohibitive for the great major
ity. The jitneys help some, but they
can't carry as many as want to go
during rush hours; also, the fare, 25
cents, is too high for many people.
Ocala will never be able ,to obtain full

Explanation of System Under
Which the Federal Loan
''-.---
Act Will be Operated .'
(Associated
Washington, Aug. 14. After many
years of investigation and debate to
develop the best method of providing
financial aid for the farmer at normal
interest rates -and on long time, Con
gress has passed a farm loan act,
President Wilson has named members
of the board which will administer
its provisions, and the work of organ
izing the vast new system is about to
begin. '
Secretary McAdoo ex-officio mem
ber of the farm l6an board, which will
be at the head of the system, predicts
that it cannot be in operation for at
least six months and probably loans
cannot be made be'fore next spring.
In operation the .system to some ex
tent will do for the farmer what the
federal reserve system does for the
business man. The farmer will be
given opportunity to secure money on
his most available commodity, his
land, just as the merchant and man
ufacturer has been enabled through
the federal reserve system to-, have
his paper, based on commercial trans
actions, find a ready market.
The new scheme; has many points
of resemblance to the federal reserve
system but in many essential features
it is entirely different. In no way will
the banks created under' it do com
mercial banking, and while it is pos
sible than in years to come they may
have funds to loan that will amount
tp several hundred million dollais, it
is not believed probable that the sys
tem ever will have the resources of
the reserve system.
' The act provided for a division of
continental United States into twelve
bank districts, with a federal land
bank in eah. -The work of designat
ing these districts and selecting the
center at which the loan banks are
to be located will be the first import
ant duty of the farm loan board and
is expected to result is just as many
bitter contests as preceded the an
nouncement of the lines of the twelve
federal reserve districts and the loca
tion of federal reserve banks. The
only directory provision in the farm
loan act says that land banks shall be
located with particular reference to
the farm loan needs of the country,
so the board will have wide discretion.
Many applications from .cities, par
ticularly in the northwest and south
west, already have been filed in the
treasury, but the board will not make
public ; its conclusions , until it has
traveled over the country and held
hearjngs in many states.
Each federal land back must have
a minimum subscribed capital of
$750, before it can start business. If
within thirty days after books are
opened for subscription to the stock
of any of these bands individuals pr
corporations have not subscribed that
amount the secretary of the treasury
is directed to subscribe for the United
States in the needed sums. Stock in
the banks may pay t dividends when
earned, but the United tSates as a
stockholder cannot participate with
others. , !
The banks will not, except in spe-!
cial cases, loan direct to farmers, but
through the agency of national farmj
loan associations, which may be or
ganized to any number" in a landj
bank district by any ten . owners orj
prospective owners of farm land who
desire to secure loins on farm prop-;
erty. Applications for charter,, for
these associations must go up to the
farm loan board and may be refused
by iL No association will be charter
ed unless it is shown that signing
members desire loans totaling at least
.120,000.
In applying for membership in an
association,- a farmer must take five
per cent of the face value of the de
sired loan in stock of the association.
Applications for loans are to be
passed upon by a loan committee of
the farm loan association. Loans will
be made only on first mortgages or
farm property and the value of the
land will be the main consideration.
The land will be subject to inspection
by an appraiser of the farm, loan
board. Loans will be made only for
purchase of land, for its improve
ment, or for purchase of live stock,
equipment, fertilizers, or to provide
buildings on a farm or to liquidate in-

debtedness, existing when the first as
sociation is formed in the county
where land is located. No loan will
be made of more than $10,000 nor less
than $100. Interest will not be
charged greater than six per cent. .
The loan itself will be reduced thru
an amortization plan providing for
reduction by annual or semi-annual
payments on the principal. No mort
gage shall run for more than forty
years nor less than five, and there are
the necessary provisions in ths law
for satisfaction of overdue interest
or amortization payments.
The money to ' be loaned will come
through the federal land banks,
passed to the hands of the Nafional
Farm Loan association and to the
farmer. The capital stock- of the
land banks will not give them much
loaning power so Congress increased "
that power greatly by authorizing the
banks-to issue farm loan bonds and
sell them in the open market. The
act provides that when a federal land
bank has loaned $50,000 to farmers it
may issue a corresponding amount of
farm loan bonds, and that -the total
that may be issued by any one bank
on a minimum capital of $750,000, Is
to be twenty time that capital. Thi3
would give 'each bank $15,000,000 and
the whole system $180,000,000 to loan
on first mortgages. , .
Farm loan bonds are to be made at- -tractive
by payment of not more than
five per cent interest and a provision
that they shall be exempt from -federal,
state or municipal taxation.
They are made legal investments for
trust funds. They are not to be obli
gations of the United States, but will
have behind them the first mortgages
on farm lands. These mortgages also
are exempt from taxation.
In case local conditions do not favor
organization of farm loan associa- ,
tions land banks may be authorized
by the farm loan board to make loans .
to farmers through agents it ap
proves, such as banks, trust or mort
gage companies, and the law permits
establishment of joint stock land
banks to lend directly to borrowers on
first mortgages of farm lands. These ,
bands will be under supervision of the
farm loan board, but will not be as
sisted by federal loan bank funds as
will loan associations. The stock
banks, however, which are. to be cap-
italized at not less than $250,000
each, also may issue farm loan bond3,
exempt from taxation and based on
first mortgage securities, to the ex
tent of fifteen times their capital
stock. These banks are subpect to
the same provision of the law as loan
associations, in respect to interest
rates, amortization, etc.
In the beginning the federal" land
banks will be governed by directors
appointed by the farm loan board, but
after subscriptions from loan associa
tions to any federal land bank's cap
ital stock, reach $100,000, an elective
system will become effective, with
three directors chosen by the board
and six by the loan association. The
board will approve compensation
paid directors and officers of these .
banks. The loan associations will be
directed by unpaid officers except a
secretary and treasurer, or secretary
treasurer. -
Banks and loan associations will be
subject to the customary examina
tion by persons appointed by the ,
farm loan board and the law provides
penalties r. for infrigmements of its
provisions or counterfeiting of farm
loan bonds.
