Amsterdam, Holland, Aug. 11. An
Austrian semi utlic ial account of the
Sinking by a submarine recently of the
Italian mail steamship l.etlmbro, re
ceived here today from Vienna, says
the Italians Bred on the submarine
with two guns and that there were

"After the submarine had fired a

opened lire from two guns at the

steamship, replying to the fire without
hitting the vessel, which had shown
no flag.
"Later, boats were lowered from
the steamer. Alter ascertaining that
no one remained on board, the steam
ship was sunk by the submarine.
"Approaching the boats, the submit
rinet ascertained that of thirty per
sons in one boat twenty were in kha

RAILWAY STRSKEILAST TWO DAYS OF
MAY BE AVERTED
Peeling of Optimism Follows Meet
ing with President
ARBITRATION MAY BE ADOPTED
Men Said to- Be Willing Provided
Railway Managers Withdraw
Counter-Proposals.
Washington, Aug. 1- President
Wilson Conferred With the represen
tatives of the railway men's brother
hoods today In the hope of averting
the threatened strike.
Tho conference took place shortly
after 10 o'clock this forenoon and con
tinued for about one and one half
hours. When they left the White
Home the men appeared much more
Optimistic than when they first arriv
ed In the city.
Another conference was arranged
for 'A o'clock ibis afternoon to follow
a meeting of the railway managers.
It was unollicially stated that the
men had agreed to submit their dif
lerence to arbitration, provided the
railway managers would withdraw
their counter proposals. This provis
ion the heads of the transportation
lines are reported to be willing to
concede.
New York. Aug. 14. A general
strike on virtually all the railroads of
the nation, paralyzing commerce and
throwing approximately L'.ouu.oou men
out of employment, can be averted on
ly through the good offices of Presi
dent Wilson as a result of yesterday's
developments In the dispute over the
men's demands for an eight-hour day
and time and a half for overtime.
rhe controversy was laid before the
president, at his invitation, ufter the
Workers had llally rejected any lorm
of arbitration. They had refused
mediation Saturday.
Soon utter a cepting the president's
summons, extended through the fed
eral board of mediation and concilia
tion, the men announced that the lead
ers of the four railroad brotherhoods
would leave for Washington at mid
night, accompanied by 80 of the 600
delegates assembled nt New- York.
An hour later the railroad managers.
19 In number, said they would leave
for the capital at the same time
Secretary Tumulty arrived In New
York last ngihl to make arrangements
for the meeting .
Mr. Tumulty brought with mm a
communication from resident Wilson
addressed to the brotherhoods and the
railroad managers, pointing, out tht
sudi n paralysis of business as would
follow a general railroad strike would
be a catastrophe at any time but
would be nothing short of n disaster
under present conditions. On this
ground he based his request tor a can
ference before a strike order Is use. I
by the b ailers of the men.
Negotiations had not been broken
off when Mr. Tumulty left Washing
ton. but when he reached I'hilade!
phiu he received a telegram from W.
Chambers, one of the mediators
informing him the men had declined
to arbitrate. Mr. Tumulty's first step
ufter reaching New York city was to
call President Wilson on the long dls
tance telephone to decide on un hour
for the fatciul conference nt the
White House today.
The final break mine tale yesterday
ifter the men had been in seciet ses
sinn nearly six hours. Be port', differ
as to the reason for the failure of the
negotiations In view of flic cheerful
outlook that obtained the night
before. The men assert they refused
arbitration because the railroads in
sisted on iiibltrating their "contingent
proposition.' The board of mediators
in a statement last night. declared
however, the men rejected their pro
position, i (intending thai they would
not arbitrate even If the rnllroiub
waived the contingent proposition.
The chief objection of the men to
arbltiating the rallioads' "contingent
proposition" lay In their contention
thill the proposal entailed the wiping
out of double compensation features
which the men have gained durlin: 3u
years of effort. The rnilroads luiv
contended that double compensation
together with the demands of the
men. If granted, would Increase the
wages of many of their employes more
than Inn per cent.
F.llshu LOS, chiilrinnii of the confer
ence committee of railroad managers
declined to discuss the crisis other
than to suv (hat the railroads hud
proposed, llrst. mediation, and then
arbitration, without incests. He
placed the responsibility for the nt
tor failure of the mediators upon the
men.
A. B. Cnrretson, president of the oi
der of railway trainmen, the official
ckpiiiKitsun for Hie men, on the other
hand, placed the blame for Hie break
entirely upon the nnbondtni attitude
nl the railroads.

CHAUTAUQUA
ARE BEST
Two Fine Programs for Tuesday
and Wednesday
ALSO BIG MUSIC FEATURES
Dr. Turner Wnrmly Greeted Saturday
Two Addresses by Monteville
Flowers of California.
The continnence of large audiences
at the Chautauqua programs of Satur
day and Sunday prove that the enter
tainments this year are up to the
standard set by previous Chautauquas
and that in some ways even exceed
past performances in variety and
quality. The programs Saturday con
sisted of two violin recitals by Mr.
and Mrs. Henry Such and two lec
tures. "Watch Your Step," by Dr. A.
K. Turner and "Rebuilding the
Temple" by Montaville Flowers. Sun
day evening, there was a program to
which there was no admission
charged and Which consisted of devo
tional exercises conducted by the local
pastors and an address by Mr. Flow
ers on "The Fashion of his Counten
men '.
Dr. Turner, who spoke Saturday af
ternoon .on "Watcli our btep Is
popular with Bennington people.
His personality brought him into close
touch with the community when he
was superintendent of last years
Chautauqua. His address was Oiled
witii information combined witu a
sparkling humor which made his lec
tuie seem entirely too short.
Dr. Turner instanced the precau
Hons taken by railroads in the coun
try against the loss of life on their
roperty and declared that the people
of the Fnited States should take simi
lar precautions In conserving national
property and resources and In defend
lii national Issues. There are Bi VI f
al tonus of community waste, ednca
tionul waste, elbciency waste, hygenic
waste and commercial waste, all of
which are endangering the very exist
ence of our country.
The speaker said that we should
train ourselves to lead a life of sym
pa thy, sincerity and serenity and that
parents should provide their children
with something to do so that they may
render real social service. Ther
was one other community loss men
Honed, a loss which is laying wastt
iu Europe, the loss of war. it was d
Glared that while there will probably
be a recovery in the liuaiici.il nffalrs
of the involved nations within a com
paratively le.v years, it will take mor
than 'Jim years to recover from the re
paired intellect, moral standing, and
Injured physique ol the nations en
gaged In the conllict.
The address dosed with the warn-
up: that the struggle iiet'.veen capital
and labor in the Fnited States might
prove Just as dangerous us u struggle
between nations nnd unless there is
in appUanCS of more of the milk of
human kindness in Hie affairs of men,
there win be no marked betterment.
We have been living in n state of
charmed optimism during the past few
years, but It will be no protection In
the near future.
Following the address of Dr. Turner,
MM the Initial violin recital rendered
by Mr. and Mrs. Henry Such. Mr.
Such is a famous violinist who has
studied his profession In many coun
tries and has rea lied a position where
he may be tanked with best violinists
in the world. Mrs. Such Is a Splendid
mUsldan and pianist and plays n vital
part in the success of her husband
Five selections were given, some of
whlih were composed by Mr. Such and
each was rendered ill a manner which
leit no criticism In the minds of the
listener.'
Saturday evening a second concert
was given by Mr. and Mis. Such which
was even more greatly eiijoved than
the one in the afternoon, judging from
the encore ', which were demanded by
the audience.
"RSbnlldlng the Temple" bv Monta
ville Flowers was the Una) address of
the day. Ills lecture stimulating In
making his audience think for them
selves on the great Issues discussed.
Mr. Flowers spoke of the collapse of
tlie temple ot civilisation at the out
break et the European war ami of the
fact that this temple must be rebuilt
nfter tho war. War was brought SbOUt
by eriois iu government, violation ci
(he rights ol nations, and In the b ii
Ipition of nation Itself. If we would
rebuild Hie temple of i Ivill.alion upon
a stronger foundation, we must elimi
