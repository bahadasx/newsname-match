Must Be Delivered No Matter
What the Cost.
President Wilson will make the tinal effort to-day to prevenf
a nation-wide railway strike.
The Federal mediators have thrown up their hands in de
, -pair. Representatives of the four great brotherhoods of 400,
000 trainmen employed on evetry railroad throughout the country
refused flatly yesterday to arbitrate anything. Whereupon the
mediators asked both sides to the controversy to meet the Presi
denl in Washington and the invitation WM accepted. A rielega
tion of tho employes, tho conference committee of railroad man*
agr-rs and the mediators went to the eapital last night.
The leriousneM of the crisis that the whole country faces
became more apparent than ever. It showed itself plainly in the
worried faces of the mediators when their final pleas to the rail?
road men met grim, firm determination. It could be read be?
tween the lines of the statement that told of their failure.
Manager*** Look for a Strike.
It was evident in the whispered opinions of railroad man
agers, v.ho frankly expect a strike. Most of all it spoke out
clearly in the words of Austin B. Garretson, president of the
Brotherhood of Railway Conductors, spokesmen for the unions:
"Unless the President of the United States is able to find a
jroad uut," said the Middle-Western labor chief, who has taken a
commanding position among the union leaders, "this means iustj
what you said?strike."
The situation that President Wilson faces is this:
The four brotherhoods of engineers, firemen. conductors an<i
i trainmen are determined not to arbitrate even their own de*
mands for an eight-hour day and time and a half pay for over.
time, supposing that the railroads would consent to waive ??'?r
tain counter-proposals.
Arbitration Insisted Ipon.
The railroad managers are equally insistent that the whole
controversy, demands of the men and counter-proposals of thu
roads, shall be submitted to arbitration or they will let thr strike
oroceed.
