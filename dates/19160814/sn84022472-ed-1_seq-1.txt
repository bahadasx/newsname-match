On the eve of a national and state

, present at the dinner. Treasurer Mpr
rie Winton announced that outside of
the price of the dinner a few dollars
were left In the treasury and he pro
ceeded to distribute this "money pro
rata among the diners. Then, after
Treasurer Winton had said a few more
kind words to "the boys," President
. Fred Curtis pronounced the benedic
tion and the Twelfth District Indepen
dent Social and Political club passed
Into history. Its end had long been
expected and predicted by both Demo- L

Because of the danger, not only of
Infantile paralysis, but of all com
municable diseases being transmitted
by money, Bridgeport banks are like
ly soon to- begin a system of daily fu
migation of currency for tjhe protect
tion of the public," primarily, and the
bank employes. ,
An official of a, local bank has con
suited with. Dr. Sophian on the mat
ter, and the latter agreed that cash-is
likely to be a transmitter, of deadly
disease germs. A conference will be
held, by representatives of the more
important banks here, to discuss the
feasibility of the fumigation, plan.
Because of complaints to the
health department of the likelihood
that gerros are transmitted by the
mail from quarantined houses, Dr. So
phian proposes, with the copsent of
the persons quarantined, to collect all
such mall and fumigate it at the
health department rooms.
Dr. Sophian issued a warning to Jit
ney drivers today that they must ac
cept for transportation, no children
under 10 years of age. "It is a hard
matter to enforce this by supervis
ing each Jitney, but steps will be tak
en it the children are carried. ' -
"We have. designated the hours of

afternoon, the sentiment of the med
ical profession was expressed concern
ing the proposed city hospital.
It is planned to have the building
somewhere on the outskirts of the city,
but not on the town farm. This is
objected to because of .the proximity
of the munitions factories .and pow

cause of objections against the town

Dr. Sophian proposes that the build

with private rooms for those who can

to get the building because of the ne
cessity of visiting such hospitals and

New Tork, Aug. 14. The epidemic
of Infantile paralysis took a turn for
the better today. The number of new

killed 31 children in the five boroughs

there were 141 new cases discovered
and 22 fatalities. The falling off In

Ago, Comes True
BROODED SEVERAL
DAYS ON PROSPECT
Friends' Badgering Failed
to Shake His Belief In
Soothsayer
Fulfillment of - the prophecies of a
gypsy fortune teller is noted in the
death of Louis Donabella, who suc
cumbed yesterday morning while sit
ting at the breakfast table in the home
of Dominica Crucia of 146 Linen ave
nue with whom he 'had been living for
the last 18 months. Death was due to
heart failure in the opinion of Med
ical Examiner S.'M. Garlick but as to
whether brooding over the fortune
teller's opinion that he was to meet his
end yesterday Influenced , his demise,
the physician refused to comment.
According to Dr. Garlick, who con
ducted his, autopsy on, the death of
Donabella, the latter, a man of 50
years, went to a fortune teller during
the week 1 and had his palm read.
When he' returned , to his boarding
house he appeared', downcast and
when he did not cheer up! the mem
bers of the Crucia family asked the
reason for his dismal attitude. Believ
ing that he had heard bad news of
either of his two sons who are at the
front with the Italian army, Crucia
asked if anything had happened to
them. Donabella stated that he had
not heard from his offspring, so, at a
loss to" guess the cause of Donabella's
moodiness, Crucia asked to be told
what preyed so heavily on Donabella's
mind.
Tn renly Donabella, Dr. Garlick said,
told Crucia and his wife that he had
paid a visit to the seer and was told
that he was;,, to die Sunday. The
thought of sudden death whn he was
lust beginning. to realize the jovs of
life, could not be dismissed' from his
mind, popabella stated. Trtlng the
gypsy s predictions with Mgnt neart,
the members of the Crucia family ban
tered Donabella good naturedly about
his approaching ena but he remained
morose and moody.
Testerdav morning. Donabella arose
about 6 o'clock and an hour later sat
down to the breakfast tabl with the
Curcia family. He still grieved and
though the members of the famllv
tried to cheep him up. his manner did
not change. -Finally Crucia arose from
the table, and went to his room to
prepare for church. Suddenly he heard
his wife call to him, "Hurry, hurry,
Dominlck,' Louis is dying" At the
table Donabella had collapsed and
fallen to the floor. His limp tody was
picked up and placed a chair but
when a physician was summoned, he
found that life was extinct. "

Thirty-five Chiefs of Four Brotherhoods in Con
ference at White House Find That President
Has Remarkable Grasp of Situation Man
agers to Be Received by Chief Executive This
Afternoon Situation Brighter, Says Brother
hood Leader.
Washington, Aug. 14 Prospects for averting a nation-wido
railway strike or at least for the formulation of some tentative
program which will be the groundwork for further negotiations
brightened today" after President Wilson had conferred with 35
chiefs of the great brotherhoods.
After the conference the brotherhood men declared the ;
President's grasp of the situation and the position of the men '
might result in an understanding being reached and others in,
touch with the conference said the representatives of the men'
showed a disposition to co-operate to avoid a strike.
Leaders Find Encouragement
After hearing the leaders of the men two hours the Presi-j
dent arranged for another meeting with them later in ,the after
noon. , How far whatever progress made at the conference with
the men can go toward averting a break cannot(ie determined
until after the President's conference with the managers' com
mittee.. . . 1 '
One of the leaders of the four brotherhoods after leaving
the White House, characterized the conference with the Presi
dent as "mos"jraging" and declared ("The outlook for tho
prevention ral strike was hopeful."
, . -Whileil ds for the feeling were given, administra-
tion officials expressed confidence, that the President's inter-'
vention would result in averting a strike. , . ' '
The President, according to those
who attended the conference, showed
a familiarity with the situation that
surprised the men.
"The President was most sympa
thetic," said one -of the brotherhood
leaders, "and Mil surprising knowledge
of the situation and of our position
may result in an understanding being
reached." . ' -
The President, It was said submit
ted no counter-proposition to the men.
but he held out hope for an adjust
ment by legislation, if necessary. The
Impression prevailed among the broui'
erhood leaders that as a last resort
the President might ask Congress for
eight hour day legislation.
The leaders explained to the Presi
dent their stand against arbitration
by saying that they were carrying
out the wishes of the 800 delegates
who eat with them at their meeting
with the federal mediators. The, aei-
egates, the President, was told. In de-J
bating on whether they should accept
or reject the mediators' proposal to
arbitrate voted unanimously for re
lection.
, The brotherhood leaders presented
to the President detailed reports of
the vote cast In favor of a general
strike.
The brotherhood men went Into a
conference firm in their determination
not to accept an arbitration under the
Kewlands act, which they contend has
always furnished arbitrators befote
whom the men did not have an un
prejudiced opportunity.
There were some indications that
the President, recognizing that view,
might propose a special arbitration
before a board of 12 members on
which the four brotherhoods could be
reDresented.
The President's plan was to appeal
to managers and men on the highest
patriotic grounds to find a way to
compose their differences without a
strike. The President's conference
with the men was opened with a state
ment by A. B. Garretson, of the con
ductors, as spokesman. Me outunea
the demands for an eight hour day and
time and a half for overtime. He in
Risted that the demands were fair.
President Wilson then addressed the
men, pointing out what disaster would
follow a general strike and Insisting
that an agreement must be reached.
The President fhen asked' to know
what were-the specific things .on
which the employes were prepared to
insist. Mr. Garretson did most of
the talking for the men and he and
the President discussed the situation
thoroughly. Mr. Wilson proceeded to
take the demands up with the man
agers in an effort to find a common
ground on which the two sides could
meet. He said he was anxious to set
tle the difficulty as quickly as possible
and was prepared to remain in contin
uous1 conference, all day if necessary.
After being with the President two
hours, the representatives of the men
left the White House and Mr. Garret
son said they expected to see the
President again later in the day after
he had conferred with the managers.
Mr. Garretson refused to say whether
the outlook was hopeful.
"As long as the matter Is In Presi
dent Wilson's hands we will have no
statement to make," said .Mr. Garret
son. The President Immediately sent for
the railroad managers to lay before
them the position of the workmen. It
was arrangoa tnat uio managers
should see the President at S o'clock
fhla afternoon and that meanwhile
the President would Keep one or two
other Important engagements, includ
ing one with Mr. Chambers, of tho
Federal board. .
The managers were-at one hotel and
the brotherhood at another while the
federal mediators set about arranging
the conference. It was decided that
the President should see the contest- ,
ants separately to get a -clearer Idea'
of their respective positions.
The first development of the day
was a declaration by A. B. Garretson,
speaking for th brotherhoods, that
t&a mma were through with the prop
osition of arbitrating under the Xew-
lands act. Previous arbitrations un- ,
der that law. he reiterated, had dem. i
onstrated that the neutral arbitrators
held the balance of power. He de- '
claVedr that any special arbitration into -which
the men - might agree to enter
would have to make provision for an
extension of those arbitrators to give
the men what they consider a fair
chancel ' .
: The representatives of the men were
expecting to return to New Tork for
further-con fereaces jjrith the man- :
agers tomorrow, fcnft nad re-engageff
the hall where they have ben meeting
for tomorrow morning. Officially, Mr. '
Garretson said today the brotherhoods ;

of - the message he carried from the j
President. - ...
form of arbitration on the part of the
brotherhoods," said Mr. Garretson to
day, "centers on the results experl-
enceci jn securing arbitrators who
could do Justice to the cause of the
men. In the past there .have beenv
.neutral arbitrators of high standing
'and Intelligence, such as John H. Fin- '
ley of New Tork, and Beth Law, for
mer mayor. No Matter how' honest
their intentions they could not bring I -to
bear on the questions at issue the :
disinterestedness necessary.. Finley's
future relies entirely on the direction
of corporate influences while Low, al
though honest, was surely influenced
by the fact that he Is a large, owner
of stocks and bonds. , .
"The appointments of neutral arbl- ;
trators In the past under the provi
sions of the Newlands. act have
damned arbitration as a practical pro
position in the minds of the men."
' W. L. Chambers, of the federal me
diators, conferred with President '
Wilson early this morning and ar- "
ranged for the conferences. There was
suggestion that the President might
urge an arbitration' by a board of 12
members so that each of the' railroad
brotherhoods could be represented.
The President, it was Indicated very
clearly, would appeal to both em
ployers and men on the highest pa- ,
triotlc grounds to meet and settle their
differences without resort to a strike,
president Wilson cancellled a long list
of engagements in order to give all
time to the situation.
