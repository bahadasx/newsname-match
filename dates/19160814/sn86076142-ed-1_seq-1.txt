ENT CONFEKS WITH MQTHEIMOODS THIS MffllNING
East Prostrated With Fear
Of Starvation and Utter
Ruin of Every Business
I Br Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, August 14. Pros
pects of averting a nation wide rail
road strike or at least formulating a
tentative program which will be the
groundwork for further negotiations
brightened after the president con
ferred with the 35 chiefs of the great
brotherhoods. After the conference
brotherhood men declared the presi
dent's grattp of the situation and the
position of the men might result In
an understanding. Others In touch
with the situation said the represen
tatives showed a disposition towards
co-operation to avoid a strike.
"The president was most sympa
thetic," said one brotherhood leader.
"His knowledge of the situation and
our position may result In an under
standing being reached."
The president. It Is understood,
submitted no counter proposition to
the men.
The conference with the men was
opened by a statement from A. B.
Garretson, of the conductors' brother
hood, as apokesman. He outlined the
demands of the meu for an eight hour
day and time and one half for over
time. He Insisted that the demands
were fair.
President Wilson, In addressing the
men, pointed out the disaster follow
ing a general strike and asked tor
the specific demands on which the
employes were prepared to Insist.
The president promised to take up
the demands of the managers In an
effort to reach a common ground on
which both sides could meet He
said he was prepared to remain in
continuous conference all day if nec
essary.
The managers remained closeted
with the president for an hour. They
loft to hold a meeting to discuss a
suggestion the president made about
renewing the conference at the White
House tomorrow. It was indicated
that the employes made a suggestion
which the managers desire to discuss.
The suggestion is believed to be that
the president appoint neutral arbitra
tors to serve as representatives of
each side. The president issued the
following statement this afternoon:
"I have met both sides and gone over
the case with the utmost frankness.
I shall not be able to Judge until to
morrow whether we have a feasible
basts of settlement."
( Br Associated Press.)
NEW YORK. August 14. If the
president falls to persuade the rail
road men and their employers to set
tle their differences and a general
strike is called it will be directed
from headquarters here. At the
brotherhood headquarters It waa said
preparations had been completed for
putting Into effect a strike stopping
every train, passenger and freight, on
the 225 railroad lines of the United
Slates. Authorities here declare that
while national labor laws gave the
president no right to Interfere offi
cially, his broad police powers gave
him authority to put soldiers on
trains and even declare martial law.
The tension in business circles
shows the realization of the acute
danger of a national calamity. Ag
gregate financial losses running into
a hundred millions, labor idleness
and food privation are some t the
possibilities the strike presents. The
immediate seriousness Is the food
supply. Large communities receiving
food from long distances may be
forced to rely on what products can
be brought by wagons, autos, trolley
or vessels. A suspension of country
exports and congestion of imports
at coast cities, stranding thousands of
travelers and visitors at summer re
sorts are among other possibilities
of the strike situation at present

ROME, AUGUST 14. The Austrians are resisting stubbornly
with' a vigorous offensive in the vicinity of Gorizia, -on the. San
Gabriel line, San Marco heights. c .
It is improbable that this is their real line of defense, as they
have a new point of resistance on the high plains of Bainsuza,
overlooking the Gorizia plain, which would interfere with the free
movement of the Italians. The Austrians, although badly defeated
at Gorizia, are still strong.

the early part of the evening and
apparently was In an ugly mood and
bent on making trouble. When he

evidence of Mils condition, until he
engaged in an altercation that put a
damper on the proceedings. Riley,
who was behind the bar, came out In

dressed Comersford In an appeal not
to make any trouble In the jiouse, as
it would drive the crowd away and

again and again In the region of the
groin, where one blow severed the
femoral artery. Riley staggered back
Into the saloon, bleeding from the
last wound. An effort was made to
secure medical attendance and a call
was sent tor an ambulance. Had
prompt measures been applied Riley
would have probably been saved from
death, as the only attention he re
quired at the moment was to apply
a ligature to the artery and stop the
