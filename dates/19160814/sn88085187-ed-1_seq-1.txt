TRAINMEN SMILE AFTER SEEING WILSON
BRAINY TACOMA WOMEN'S
CAREERS RUN SIDE-BY-SIDE,
BUTSUFFRAGE VIEWS CLASH
Shall ivoinen he given suffrage by IVdcral amendment or win it state by state?
This question has spill suffrage riinks, and become a big issue In the preside,ilial campaign.
Two .young women now In Tacomu, imih liniisiuilly successful newspaper women, both fleilon
writers whom- work Is asked for before it is mitten, Imth dyed-lii-the-ivool suffragists, and both
demur ruts, have, notwithstanding: the remarkable parallel in their ciireers, reuched conclusions on
Ibis subject us far apart as the poles.
(Inly on one iiolnt do they agree. They are lioth for Wilson.
Here is what they think and why they think it:
Miss Monroe's View
Miss Anne Shan

r. William A. Mon
ic, 2.". 0 8 Mct'arver
ret, believes women

For two years Miss

r. While in Oregon,
MISS MoM'ol' sl"' was assistant
campaign manager
for William Hanley, who opposed Senator Cham
berlain for congress, and took the stump in his
behalf.
"It is for the sake of women themselves that
1 believe suffrage should be fought for and won
state by state," says Miss Monroe.
"If it comes by federal amendment, women
In many of the states in the. south and middle
west will not know what it means or what to do
with it. They are still pretty apathetic there.
"But women who have won suffrage, without
a press, from legislatures that use every means
to block them, have had their civic consciousness
awakened and their civic abilities trained as noth
ing else could do it. And when they have got
suffrage, they are organized and ready to go ahead
and put through the other measures they have
found out should be put through.
"They know what they want and how to get It.
"In New York, where they have been fighting
so long and so hard, the women are wonderful.
They can meet any politician on his own ground.
They know politics as no woman not so trained can
know them.
"The taste of polities is like the taste of blood.
Women who have once thrown themselves into a
cause will never drop back Into indifference to
what is going on in their country.
"I would like nothing better, If I could possi
bly take the time from my own work, thun to
throw myself into the campaign for Wilson.
"The big thing in suffrage is not what it will
do for the country, but what It will do for women;
and it will do more for them if they have to fight
for It state by state than if It comes more
easily."

She is a former Ta

ory here. She is now
writing for the big
gest of the maga

In Washington,

the Congressional
Union, now national
chairman of the
MRS. MKLLKT T. Woman's Party, lob
by for the federal
amendment. She 1* a friend of Alice Paul, and has
been asked to go to Colorado Springs and speak
for the Woman's Party there, but has declined.
"The national way is the only right way, both
theoretically and practically," she says.
"The nation is outgrowing the old states' rights
idea, and learning to look at things from a national
viewpoint. The interstate commerce commission
and other national boards are an instance of this
growth.
"Woman suffrage, the question of the citizenship
of half the population of the tinted States, Is a
thing that concerns all parts of the country. It is
not reasonable to leave it to the decision of indi
vidual states.
"And on the practical side, take my own case,
for instance. I had the rights of a citizen in this
state. I went to New York, and I was no longer a
citizen. I had no right*. It Is ridiculous.
"In some states, if a suffrage amendment is de
feated, it cannot be taken up again for five or ten
years. In those states it is practically impossible
to get suffrage except by federal amendment.
"The national way is in keeping with the larger
national vision which is here in many things, and
which will by and by develop into International
vision.
"As to the action of the Woman's Party in
opposing Wilson—l believe in almost any club

not allow myself to be pledged to oppose him.
And anyway, 1 think we stand list as good a

through Hughes."

should now refer to It-eelf
merely as the best in the

GOLF
Golf is the finishing school .'or
learning the fine arts of "fibbing"
and "profanity." It is called un
"old man's game," because you're
an old man before you're able to
make a decent score.
Golf has broken up more homes
than war. With war there's a
chance for the father or husband
getting b*ck home, hut with golf
there ain't no such thing.
Golf Is the simplest and easiest
game In the world. The simplest
part Is missing the ball; and the
easiest port Is losing the ball.
If you've never played a game
of golf and would like to ttnd out
what It's like, take a pinch of wet
sand and place a half dollar on it.
Then take a broom handle, close
your eyes, and take a slsm at the
four-bit piece. Then proceed to
look around for said gelt.

Wurren Stone, of the engineers,
announced, "I am optimistic."
W. P. Lee, of the firdemen, as

The employes are scheduled to
see the president again this after

railway managers at I! o'clock.
He will spend the intervening
time studying the stenographic

Railway managers are pessimis

said:
"We have no reason to change
our attitude. The men have re
fused to do anything. We are
ready for a strike, but no two
railroad managers agree on what
course to pursue. Some favor put
ting white lead on their engines
and storing them. It's a iiuestion
whether we are sufficiently ready
to prevent business paralysis."
YOUNGER BROTHER IS

Earl Jordan, who followed In

speaking of the yacht i% "Into the Primitive,"

lionaire's daughter who was cast ashore with
two other survivors on a desert island.
You'll enjoy following their adventures, their
love affairs, and their intrigues. "Into the
Primitive" really deals with but three people,
but the sum of human nature and emotions are
contained in the stiry.
The managers, in cording lo tills

able to settle the strike.

He said they never again would

They sent him off, with some
good advice, to his mother's lit

promised to get work and make
a living. Instead he idled away
his days and prowled about the
country at night.
Before half a year had passed
he and his brother Earl were be

stealing auto tires from the
Kdgewood Trading Co. store.
Cecil, still a very young man,

.Pleads for Younger Brother.
Will the younger brother, who
must serve three years in the
same prison, follow in the same
direction? Will thre eyears' con

Budge Bell, the boys' attorney,

Long Criminal Career.
But Judge Card declared the
boy had been given every possible
chance, and must suffer the full
penalty.
Cecil began his criminal career
In Tacoma In 1903, when ho
served two years for burglary.
At the end of hi* term he went
to California. In 1906 he pleaded
guilty to burglary there and was
sentenced to four years in prison.
In 1909 he got out and was again
convicted of burglary and sen
tenced to 15 years.
In 1915 he got out of Folsom
prison on parole. He came to Ta
coma and immediately was arrest
ed for burglary. In addition to
these offenses he has served
time for petty larcenies.
This was Earl's first convic
tion.
