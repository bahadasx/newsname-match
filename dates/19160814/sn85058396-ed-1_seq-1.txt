Rome, Sunday, Aug. 13, via Paris,
Aug. 14, 3:30 a. m, Descriptions of
the vigorous Italian offensive in the
vicinity of Gorizla are coming in al
most hourly. The Austrians are re
sisting obstinately on the San Ga
briele line and the Sam Marco heights,
but It is improbable that this is their
lien of defense as they have a new
point of resistance on the high plains
of Bainsizza overlooking the Gorizla
plains which interferes with the free
movement of Italian troops.
The Austrians, although badly de
feated at Gorizia, still are strong and
full of fight General Cadorna's fur
ther progress probably will be slow as
every inch of advance is being con
tested. Fighting continues on the other
front,
"In the Gorizia area artillery duels
took Jplace," the statement says.
"The enemy's batteries shelled the
town and bridges over the Isonzo.

small but sharp encounters took place
on the slopes of Forame, at the head
of the jCosteany valley on the Boite
and on the slopes of Monte Civorone.

bombs on Monfalcone and other places
on the lower Isonzo. No damage nor
casualties have been reported."

aged." Severe' Fighting in Progress.

CAUSE OF BANDITRY
Officials Declare Foreign Con
cerns Encourage Lawless
ness in Hope of Inter

Charges are being circulated even in
official circles that American mining
and other concerns with vast prop
erties In Mexico are refusing to op
erate In order to help bring about
intervention.
. This action, it is claimed, is based
on the fact that the only key to the

larly in the stato of Chihuahua, Is
the reopening of the properties.
The American owners import food
In large quantities. With plenty of
work and food, de facto government!

Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Aug. 14.
Charles E. Hughes, replying today
to criticism that he was not con
structive in his policies, declared at
an open air meeting here today that
he stood for a protective tariff, for
a budget system, the elimination of
the, pork barrel, the end of waste and
extravagance and the appointment to'
public service of men qualified for
office.
"Is not that constructive?" Mr.
Hughes asked. "I believe that they
are the fundamentals of constructive
policies which this nation is facing
today."
Mr. Hughes discussed the Demo
cratic slogan of prosperity.
"We cannot afford in this country,''
he said, "to assume that our prosper
ity will take care of itself. Who is
so foolish as to believe and to be
deceived to ascribe to themselves the
benefits that have accrued from that
great contest Their statements will
not stand the test of careful analysis.

BROTHERHOOD CHIEFS AND ROAD I
MANAGERS MEET AT WHITE HOUSE ! I
Wilson Hears Both Sides and Will Make an Announcement
Tomorrow Union Men Consider Conference as "Most 1
Encouraging" "Outlook for Prevention of General j
Strike Hopeful" Managers Place Their Side !
of Question Frankly Before President
Wilson Makes Appeal on Highest
Patriotic Grounds.
Washington, Aug. 1 4. After his conference with the j
railroad managers today, President Wilson issued the follow-
ing statement: j
"I have met both sides and have gone over the case with
utmost frankness. I shall not be able to judge until tomorrow
whether we have a feasible basis of settlement." .
Washington, Aug. 14. Prospects for
averting a nation-wide railway strike,
or at least for the formulation of
some tentative program which will be
the groundwork for further negotia
tion, brightens today after President
Wilson had conferred with thirty
five chiefs of the great brotherhoods.
After the conference the brother
hood men declared the president's
grasp of the situation and the position
of the men might result In an under
standing and others in touch with the
conference said the representatives of
the men showed a disposition to co
operate to avoid a strike.
After hearing the leaders of the
men two hours, the president sent for
the managers for a conference at 3
o'clock this afternoon.
Brotherhood Men Encouraged.
One of the leaders of the four broth
erhoods ;after leaving the White
House characterized the conference
with the president as "most encour
jiging'. and declared'the outlook-for
the, prevention of a general strike
was hopeful."
The discussion, it was learned early
this morning, centered largely about
reaching an agreement on some form
of arbitration. It was considered pos
sible that a tentative might be
reached providing lor arbitration of
the demands of the men for an eight
hour day and for time and a half over
time with' the elimination of the coun
ter proposals of the employers.
Managers Go to White House.
ShortVy after 2:30 o'clock the man
agers' committee at the conclusion of
a half hour conference, went to the
White House to meet the president
There were nineteen managers in the
party and all were silent over the de
velopments of the conference of the
men and the president earlier in the
day.
After introducing the committee of
managers to President Wilson Judge
Chambers of the mediation board
said:
"The ice appears to be melting a
little." He added that he was more
hopeful that a strike would be avert
ed than he was when he came here
from New York this morning.
Chambers did not remain at the
White House for the conference be
tween the President and the man
agers. He declared it possible that
the discussion might go over until to
morrow. Judgi' Knapp and G. W. W. Hanger,
the third member, are remaining in
New York in order to keep in touch
with a number of railway presidents
gathered there.
Washington, Aug. 14. Railroad
managers and brotherhood leaders,
deadlocked in negotiations which
threaten a nation-wide-railroad strike,
todav laid .(heir case before President
Wilson.
FirBt came 25 representatives of the
brotherhoods who conferred with tho
president shortly after 10 o'clock.
They were followed by the committee
of managers.
The brotherhood men went into
ference firm in their determination
not to accept an arbitration under
the Newlands' act which they contend
has always furnished arbitrators be
fore whom tho men did not have an
unprejudiced opportunity.
President May Appoint Board.
There were some Indications that
the president, recognizing that view
might propose a special arbitration
before a board of twelve members
on which tho four great brotherhoods
would be represented.
The president's plan was to appear
to managers and men on the highest
patriotic grounds to find a way to
compose their difficulties without a
strike.
Thexpresident's conference with the
men was opened with a statement by
A. B. GarretBon of tho conductors, as
spokesman. He outlined their de
mands for an eight hour day and
time and a half for over time. Ho
insisted that the demands were fair.
Presidont Wilson then addressed the
men, pointing out -what disaster would
follow a general strike and asking
tho specific things on which the em
ployes wero prepared to insist Mr.
Wilson promised to take the demands
up with the managers in an effort
to find a common ground on which
tho both sides could meet He said
he was prepared to remain in con
tinuous conference all day If neces
sary. The conference -w.as held in
tho Green Room of the White House.
After being with the president two I
hours, the representatives of the men"
left the White House and Mr. Garret
son said they expected to see the ,
president again later in the day after
he had conferred with the managers. j H
Mr. Garretson refused to say whether
the outlook was hopeful.
"As long as the matter is In Presi
dent Wilson's hands we will have no
statement to make," said Mr. Garret
son The president immediately sent for
the railroad managers to lay before
them the position of the workmen.
It was arranged that the managers
should see the president at 3 o'clock
this afternoon and that meanwhile
the president would keep one or two
other important engagements, includ
ing one with Mr. Chambers of the
federal board.
At the White House it was said no
indication could be given of the pro
gress ot the negotiations until the
president saw the managers. fM
Mr. Garretson, asked whether the
negotiations were off, replied:
"Absolutely not."
Administration officials expressed
confidence that the president's inter
vention would result in averting a
strike.
There- were suggestions, purely In
formal, emanating from sources in jH
touch with both sides, that the men
were regarding the possibility of arbi
tratlon with the president himself as
chief arbitrator.
President Surprises Men.
The president, according to thoso
who attended the conference, showed
a familiarity with the situation that
surprised the men.
"The president was most sympathet
ic," said one of the brotherhood lead
ers, "and his surprising knowledge
of the situation and of our position
may result in an understanding being
reached."
The president, it was said, sub
mitted no counter proposition to the
men, but he held out hope for an
adjustment by legislation, if neces
sary. May Ask Congress for Legislation. jH
The impression prevailed among
the brotherhood leaders that, as a
last resort, the president might ask
Ct . J .w0w.
The leaders explained to the presi- IH
dent their stand against arbitration jM
by saying they were carrying out
the wishes of the G00 delegates who JA
sit with them at their meeting with
' .federal mediators. The brother- JA
hood leaders presented to the presi-
dent detailed reports of tho vote cast
in favor of a general strike.
Road Wants Higher Rates,
Washington, Aug. 14. Railroad men
and shippers from many parts of tho
country appeared before tho interstate
Commerce Commission today to argue
over tho reasonableness of proposed
increased freight rates from the At- j
lantic seaboard to the intermountaln
section and from Pacific coast points
east Some of tho Increases are as
high as 100 per cent and unless sus
pended by the commission, will go
into effect September 1.
The committee of managers re- j
malncd in conference with the presi:
dent an hour and as they left, Ellsha J jH
Lee, their spokesman, refused to
make any statement
Tho managers left the White House
to hold a meeting to take up sugges
tions laid before them by the presi
dent and will see him again at 9 i
o'clock tomorrow morning. The prea
ident arranged to see Judge Cham
hers later today.
It was indicated that the employes
had made a suggestion which -the
managers want to discuss among
themselves. Tho suggestion wTas be
liered that the president appoint neu- ( tM
tral arbitrators to serve with repre- JH
sentatlves of each side. j
Strike Outlook Brighter.
Washington, v Aug. 14. Judge Wil-
Ham L. Chambers, commissioner of i
the United StateB board of mediation '
and conciliation, said on his arrival 9
here today to see President Wilson
that he believed that the chances for
the president settling tho threatend
strik of railroad employes brighter j
than were the chances of the board. f
