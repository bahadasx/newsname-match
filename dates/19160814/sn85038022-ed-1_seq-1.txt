New York, August 13 A general
strike on virtually all ol the rail
road of the nation, paraliln com
merce and throwing approximately 2,
000,000 men out of employment, can
be averted only through the Rood of
flcea of President Wilson, aa a reault
of today's developments In the dis
puta over the men's demands for an
olght-hour day and time and a half
for overtime. The controversy was
laid before the President at his Invi
tation after the workers had flatly re
jected any form of arbitration. They
refused mediation yesterday.
Soon after accepting the President's
summons extended through the Fed
eral Board of Mediation aad Concilia
tion the men announced that the Isad
ora of the rnllroad brotherhoods would
leave for Washington at midnight ac
companied by thirty of the 699 dele
gates assembled here.
An hour later the railroad mana
gers, nineteen in number, said that
they would leave for the Capitol at
the same time.
Both parties will reach Washington
tomorrow In time for an early confer
ence with the President.
Mr. Tumulty brought with him I
communication from President Wil
son addressed to the brotherhood and
the railroad managers pointing out

that such a paralysis of business aa
would follow a general railroad strike
would be a catastrophe at any time,
hut would be nothing short of a dis
rate? under pr-rent conditions. On
these grnnnds the President made his
request to attend a confereace with
representatives of both faotlona be
fore a strike order Is Issued by the
le aders of the men.
The final break came late today af
ter the men had been In secret ses
sion nearly six hoars. Reports differ
as to the reasons of the failure of the
negotiation, iu view of the cheerful
outlaok of the night before. The men
assert they refused arbitration be
cause the railroads Instated on arbi
trating their "contingent proposition."
The Board of Mediation, In statements
Issued tonight declared, however, the
men rejected the proposals, contend
ing that they would not arbitrate.
President Much Concerned
Washington, August 13 President
Wilson, deeply concerned over the
possibility that a great strike may tie
up the country's railroads, is prepared
to make an insistent personal appeal
for an amicable settlement when the
representatives of the railroads and
their employes confer with him tomor
row at the White Heune.
Sine the situation became threat
ening the President has been in close
touch with developments and baa
used every available agency of tha
Federal government to bring the two
factions together. He has taken no
stand on the merits of the controversy
however, and It Is not expected that
he will do so at the conference tomor
row. It is understood he will reit
erate the argument set forth in the
communication delivered in New York
tonight by Secretary Tumulty, and
will emphasize the far reaching ef
fect a strike would have on the whole
countrv.
