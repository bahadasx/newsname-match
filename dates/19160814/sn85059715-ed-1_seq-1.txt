managers and brotherhood leaders

threaten a nationwide railroad strike
Monday laid their ease before I'rcsi-?
dent Wilson.
Kirst came Ihirty-flve representatives
of the brotherhoods who conferred
with the president shortly after
in o'clock Tliov were followed by
the committee nf managers.
llrothcrlinnd Objects.
The hrotherheod men went into the i
rnnference firm in their determination
not to neeept an arbitration under the
Xew lands law, whieh they contend i
had always furnished arbitrators, be'ore
whom the men did not have un-j
. prejudiced opportunity.
There was some Indication that the!
j president, recognizing that view,
j might propose a special arbitration he- j
I Tore n tionrd nf twelve members on
.vhieh the brotherhoods could he rep-,
-esentcd.
President's Plan.
The president's plan was to appeal j
to managers and men on the highest:
patriotic grounds to find a way tnrnni-,
pose their differences without a strike, ;
The first development of the dayj
was a declaration hy A. P. Garrottson.i
1 '
speaking ror me nruineniuuufl ......
llir men were through with arbitrating:
under the Xcwlands law. Previous!
arbitral ions, he said, proved that the!
neutral arbitrators held the balance
nf power. He declared that any special
arbitration Into which the men
might agree to enter would have to
make provisions to give the men what
thev considered a fair chanre.
Officially Mr. Garrcttson said the
brotherhoods had no knowledge nf
Secretary Tutmiltv's flying trip to i
Xew York nor nf the message he carried
from the president.
Chief Objection.
"The chief ohieelion to the existing
form of arbitration on the part of the
brotherhoods", said .Mr. Garrcttson,
"centers on the difficulty that has
hern experienced in selecting neutral
arbitrators. "vnn eoutu no jusuu- u>
the raii.?p of thp men. N'o matter how
honest their Intentions they eould not
hrlntt to hear on the rpiestions at issue
the disinterestedness neeessary. The
appointment of neutral arbitrators In
the past has damned arbitration as a
practleal proposition in the minds of
the men".
The president's ronferenee with the
men was opened by a statement by
Ulr. (Inrrettson. He outlined the demands
for on eight-hour day and time
and a half for overtime, insisting that
they were fair. President Wilson then
addressed the men pointing nut what
disaster would follow a general strike
and insisting that an agreement must
he reached. <
Wilson is Anxious.
The president then nsked In know
the speeifie things on whieh the employes
were prepared to insist. Mr.
Wilson promised to take the demands
np with the managers in an effort to
find a common ground on whirlt the
two sides could meet. He said he
was anxious to settle the difficulty as
quickly as possible and was prepared
to remain in continuous ronferenrr all
day If necessary.
T.?rge crowds of tourists gathered
on the lawn in front of the White
Tlonse to hear the news of the proceedings.
Informal Suggestion.
There was some suggestion, purely
Informal, emanating from neither
one side nor the other but. from
sources in touch with hoth. thai the
men were regarding the possibility
of arbitration wllh the president liitn'
self as ehlef arbiter.
After being with the president Iwo
^ hours, the men left the White House
and Mr. f.arrettson said they exported
to see the president again later
In the day after he had conferred
with the managers.
"As long as (he matter Is in President
Wilson's hands we will have
no statement to make," he said.
The president immediately sent for
the railroad managers to lay before
11 ?* nneitlnn rt f f ho Tl* r? r If m fx n
iiicm me wi v.
It was arranged they should see th4
| president at 3 o'clock Monday afternoon.
Meanwhile Mr. Wilson would
keep one or two other important engagements,
Including one with Mr.
\ Chambers of the federal board.
May Avert Strike.
Ot the White House It was said
no indication could be given of the
progress of negotiations until after
\ the president saw the managers. Mr.
' Garrettson was asked whether the
negotiations were off. He replied:

"The president was most sympa!

leaders, 'and his surprising knowl|

sition may result in an understanding

The president submitted no counter
proposition to the men but held
1 nut for an adiustment by legislation,
if necessary.
The impression prevailed among
the brotherhood leaders that as a
last resort the president might ask
Congress tor eight-hour day legislation.

NEW YORK, Aug. 14. The commit-1

of the national foreign trado council
1 wlilcli has been investigating the effect
of the European war on American
oversea cotntnerce and the necessity
of permitting American exporters
the saute rights to combine that
are enjoyed by their roinpelltors. has
inuf i.tntlo mi hi ir> iiu rnnnrf. Aniilvzinc
"Fortuitous Elements in Present Foreign
Commerce", It sayr. In part:
"In 1913 the per capltn foreign trade
i of England was $119, of Germany $79.
and of the United States only $11. For
I91G it Ik estimated Hint Hint of the
. United States will be $(13 or $58 with!
out ammunition and flrenrms.
"This excess of export trado over
the normal rests largely upon the fol1
lowing circumstances:
"Abnormal war demand and prices
for munitions, foodstuffs and raw materials.
"Elimination of normal European
competition through occupation of
European factories in .munitions production.
"I/isk of labor through enlistment
or eon.scripllon and belligerent restriction
of normal expnrlnllon.
"Curtailment of investment of European
capital in neutral .markets, |
normally it stimulus io European ex
port trade.
Ilnnger Ahead.
j "These abnormal conditions having
I prevailed in the export Iradc for
| nearly two years, many Americans
are In danger of relying upon them
as permanent. No greater fallacy Is
possible than lo neglect lo expect,
after the wnr, the following developments:
"Cessation or war-demand and
prices for munitions, reduction of prevailing
high prlrcs for exported foodstuffs
nnd raw materials by reason of
restored European competition, normal
transportation and inlcrnational
movement of raw materials.
"Hesnmption of normal European
competition In home and neutral
markets by reason of return of solr
diers lo Industry and the lifting of
military embargoes from exportation, i
"Renewed activity of European ex-i
port and import commnuiions wun
| increased governmental support and
possibly preferential tariff and navigation
arrangements under economic
alliances.
"Renewal, as rapidly as business
conditions and national, or even international,
Hscal policy will permit,
of European Investment In neutral
markets, the most effective method of
creating a foreign preference for mcrI
chandlse of leading nations. European
war finance hns been moulded
| to protect trade-winning foreign ln,
vestments; llielr nourishment will not
I be neglected with pearc.
"Against llie foregoing adverse element
must lie set the dentnndR of renewed
peaec aetivities, return of confidence.
demand for materials for immediate
reconslruction of devastated
districts and revival of development
enterprises.
"Europe's accustomed instrument
for these activities will no co-operative
effort beginning with cartels and
trade associations of producers, manufacturers,
exporters and bankers reinforced
by the backing of the state,
and, unless the discussions with whleh
Industrial Europe now vibrates shall
fail, supplemented by economic alliances
succeeding the war alliances
now in force. Continuation of the
present condition spells European industrial
and governmental co-operation
versus American compelled competition."
