House Members Plan Fight on
Senate Bill For Eight
Battle Ships.
Int-rii..tin il .NV Service-
WASHINGTON. Aue. 14. The re
volt of democratic "small navy" and
pacifist m ern hers of the house
against the administration will
reach its climax when the senate
program for the construction of
eiht capital ships is taken up ui the,
house Tuesday. The administration
endorsement of the enormous in
rreases placed in the naval hill by
the senat is looked uwn by the
democratic little navy represehta
thes as violating promises they
claim were made to them early in
tip session.
Majority l,ouder Kitetiin will bo
one of the spokesmen for the paci
fist group. He said that he expected
to discuss the "inside politics" of the
i-asal bill. Heps page of North
Carolina, and Henvley of Missouri,
who represented the pacifist demo
crats in negotiations with the ad
ministration leaders when the naval
bill was before the house naval com
mittee originally are also expected
to contribute to the expose.
The httle tuny men claim that the
administration agreed to accept and
fu;ht for the naval bill as framed in
the house as i he administration
bill" if the par ib-t group would fore
go opposition to the measure. The
p.icilists accepted the four battle
cruisers plan in the house bill to
kreji the democratic house vote
solid, with the understanding that
the administration would make no
effort to further increase the bill.
Heps. Page and Hensley, it is stated,
w ere a vuicd by Sec'y ianielx that
th'" four-ship plan was satisfactory
to the administration. The house
record shows that Daniels told
Chairman. Padgett, of the house
committee, that he was "tickled to
death" witli the house bill. Hut
wlo n the bill reached the senate the
agreement was torgotten. the antis
r l.iim. and the administration forces
doubled th" building program and
enormously increased the bill in
every particular.
The pa i'"st members of ihe house
I have little hope of defeating the
senate proposals.

Call Speculators
to Explain Rise
of Wheat Price
utTiuit i o o a 1 News Sorvb-e:
CHICAGO, Aug. 14. From a list
containing the names of a dozen or
more of the biggest wheat specu
lators in the country, United States
Dist. Atty. Cline tomorrow will .sum
mon to his office men who may be
able to tell if the recent meteoric
rise in wheat prices was the result
of manipulation.
Assisting Mr. Cline in the work of
placing the responsibility for the rise
in grain prices "which also has sent
the price of flour soaring, and which
will mean increased cost of bread,
will be Hdward N. Hurley, chair
man of the federal iKiard of indus
trial relations. Among the questions
the speculators will be asked to an
swer is whether they had advance
information on the government re
port, whether they intend to hold up
prices until Kurope offers more than
American consumers can afford to
pay, and whether an embargo on
wheat would reduce prices. Mr.
Cline ha: outlined a series of ques
tions whieh. if answered will, he be
lieves, make it possible to prevent
future manipulations. The president
of a big baking corporation here has
declared that only an embargo will
prevent the price of wheat j;oing to
$1' a bushel.

STUTE WILL LEASE
LARGE FARM TRAGT
Negotiations Are on For 2,100
Acres Near New Carlisle
For Prison Station.
Negotiations for the leasing of
2.100 acres of land around New Car
lisle which will be used as a state
farm to provide supplies for the
Michigan City prison, are being car
ried on between Clyde H. Haker,
owner of the land. Kdward J. Fo
gany, warden of the prison and
Gov. Kalston. Although the deal
has not been completed it is prac
tically certain that the state will
lease the farm land, according to
Mr. Baker.
Should the land be taken over
by the state it will be leased for
from three to live years with an op
tion of renewing the lease for 10
years. Th length of the tirst lease
has not been derailed upon, but it
is prabable that the state will take
it over for live years. The state'.s
tinances, according to Warden I'o
garty. will not permit an outritrht
purchase at this time, hut the land
will be bought later, if the farm
proves a success. Kor the present
the land will he leased on a share
basis.
Although the .Michigan city con
victs will work the farm the place
will be used partly as an experimen
tal station. It is probable that ag
ricultural experts from Purdue uni
versity will be placed in charge of
the farming operations.
Several advantages of purchasing
land have been pointed out by War

CONFERENCE OF PRESIDE!! ITH
REPRESENTATIVES OF 10TI1ERI100DS
Wilson Likely To Be Able To Submit Proposal Acceptable To
Both Sides Pointing Way To Solution Of Differences
Makes It Plain Strike Will Not Be Tolerated.
li:ternjfb'nnl Nevis Servi-e:
WASHINGTON, Aug. H. The conlldent prediction that ;i nation-wide nihvay
strike has been averted came lrom administration circles this afternoon.
Just before the representatives for the railway managers went into conference at the
white house with Pres't Wilson, members of the cabinet who have been in touch witli
Pres't Wilson, declared that the "immediate crisis" soon would be over. The president,
they said, will propose a concrete arbitration proposition, which, in their opinion, will
prove acceptable to both sides.
The nature of this proposal is known so far only to the president and representatives
of the "bi four" unions with whom he conferred earlier in the day. But the cabinet
officials insisted that it carries a real arbitration proposal which will permit the reat
issue between the two sides the eicrht-hour work dav and what it involves to be set
tied bv arbitrators.
I'res't Wilson. it was repotted,
made it plain to the brotherhood
rept esentaliv es that he could not be
the single arbitrator, or the "odd"
man in a board of arbitration. How
ever, he suggested certain names of
men that could be brought into the
plan, and the brotherhood members,
according to the cabinet members.
"listened kindly" to this suggestion, j
l':i n'l xiiiHlnn MHLi t
It is understood that at the con
ference with the brotherhood repre
sentatives the president was told
that they hud been compelled to re-
fuse arbitration under the terms sug
gested by tlie federal board of con
ciliation because they did not be
lieve that the board realized the im
portance of their demand.. The
president, it was delinitely learned, j
insisted that under no circumstances j
will the public sanction a strike. He ;
is understood to have made it plain ,
that in his opinion if a strike was

the labor leaders to treat with the
roads, the unions would be blamed
and the labor cause would suffer.
In reply the union leaders insisted
that they had received scant cour
tesy at the hands of the railway
managers, who had insisted on me
diation without making any propo
sition ol what concessions they
would be willini: to make to bring
mediation about. The president, it
is understood, insisted in reply that
he had no opinion regarding tlie
merits of the controversy; that he
intended making it plain to the rail
way managers that their responsibil
ity before the public xxas equally
great with their employes, but that i
ne xxas ueiermmea 10 prevent a
strike at : ny cost.
1H -lines to Talk.
On leaving the conference Pres't
Garretson of the conductors, said:
"We cannot talk now. Anything
we might say, of whatever nature,
might seriously embarrass the presi
dent at this time."
Asked point blank vv'hether they
had :;ot agreed upon a proposition
which the president was to submit to
the railway managers. the labor
spokesman replied:
"On that point you must ask the
pi esident."
The write house 'was exttemely
reticent rt guarding the details of the
conference. Sec'y Tumulty said that
nothing cr. uld be said until after the
conferences were completed.
Hefore F'O'OS to the white house to
confer with the president at ::
o'clock, the railroad managers heir!
a long conference in their hotel. A
statement of the side of the railways
was prepared and it was agreed th it
it should t-e read to the chief execu
tive by I!!. sha Lee, chairman of the
board of managers. Like the labor
leaders, the managers seemed hope
ful that a strike would be prevented.
iiAmo'r? is Optimistic.
Reports that the men had asked
the president to act 11s arbitrator in
person were widely circulated. No
othcial statement on this report r
on a not lie r that three members of
the cabinet mi:-;ht be asked t art
could be obtained from anv of the
interested parties.
Judge Chambers of the mediation
board, who acted as the spokesman
of the pr-sident in arranging tli-eonfcreiice-,
was optimistic in hn
belief that an agreement would b
reached that would prevent a gen
eral strike.
"It max take time, but a basis of
settlement will be reached. 1 am
confident." lie said.
ci IU-Hrt of Situation.
The president received a complete
report f tne exact situation through
Sec'y Turn iity almot before he w,m
out of (.fit. This report bad io n
compiled ny W. L. r'hambers. one o
the federal mediators, and was a
xoiuple'.e record of al! of the rftwl-
ooments since the initial effort xv
made to prevent the threatened
strike. While the text of the re
port vva coniidential it is understood
that it emphasized the refusal of
jthe union leaders to consider arbi
t trati'Wi.
The
some
president
inferred with
of his closest advisers l:t-tt
night and again early this morning.
Tt xxas announced witli authority
that be had no opinion whatever on
the merits if the controversy b-
! tween the railroads- and the union.
What he wanted, it was explained,
was to avert a general strike and
this he was determined to do if hu
manly possible. There seemed to be
a general feelini: in administration
circles that the .resident would be
able to cret the txvo factions together
rn a compromise plan
although it
at least an
j was expected to prove
! n II -dav
task.
iratdy CViiH-cmccl.
fiiricials of the administration
were more gravely concerned oxer
the threatened strike than over anj
problem that has troubled the ad
ministration. It was realized that
if the general tie-up was permitted
to qo into effect all of the progress
marie to date in trying to reconcile 1 .,
capital and labor would he lot. Al
ready there are evidentes of bitter
ness between the combined rail roan
brotherhoods and the railway presi
dents and rdhcials admitted that if
a general strike were permitted no
on could guess what tlie outcome
would be.
The president, it was reported, in
tended to make it plain to both sbb-
that the rights of the pubb were
too deeply involved to permit a
strike. While it xxas made very
plain by officials that there was r.o
intention of making threats the
president has let it ie Known tha
with eongiess in session, before he
will allow the traffic of the ration to
be tied up he will appear in person
before a ;;oint session and demand
legislation that would preclude uiy
strike.
Could 0Hratr Ito.iU.
Already the president has in
hands the authority to take over
operate the railroads i! he s-o
bis
and
de-
sires. The Hay-Chamberlain army
bill, now a law, is drastic in the
authority it gixe.s the president in
case of an emei :en y. And. w ith
