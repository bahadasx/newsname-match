NO MORE FREE PAPERS
Heretofore it has been the
practice of The Morgan City
Daily Review to be ve*y gener
ous in sending papers free to ad
vertisers, advertising agents,
public and charitable institu-1
tions, officials and others
The present shortage of white
paper makes it almost impossible
for publishers to secure supplies
sufficient to take care of our re
gular paid subscribers, and are
therefore compelled to announce
that we cut off all free copies of
every kind after August 19th.
Not only has the price of
white paper advanced form 20 to
200 per cent, and more, but the
manufacturers are all urging,rates
publishei everywhere to econo
mize in every way possible, as
supplies are limited and prices
are bound to go much higher.
Acording to the Times-Picay
une, publishers of all daily paper
of New York and Brooklyn have
determined to reduce the size of
their papers and to cut all free
circulation and to take other
drastic action to curtail the con
sumption of news print paper.
The publishers of many other
cities have taken similar steps,
nut only in reducing the daily
amount of paper used but in
raising subscription prices in or
der to meet the continual ad
vance in paper cost.
It is vfci-y generally admitted
by publishers everywhere that

the price of white print paper
will never again be so low as it
was during the years just previ
ous to the outbreak of the Eur
opean war; consequently the
newspapers must figure upon a
greater cost of production than
existed when present subscrip
tion and advertising rates were
made.
To meet this situation and to
avoid serious financial loss. The
Review finds it necesary to fall
in line with the protective mea
'sures that are being so generally
adopted thruout the country. We
hope to avoid a further increase
in subscription and advertising
and it is for this reason
j that we must cut off the free
papers,
We believe that The Keview
advertisers and the others who
have been upon the free list of
this paper will view this action :
with the broad understanding
that characterizes their gener
al view of the unsettled busi
ness conditions. Knowing that
it is not to add to the profit oi
the publishers but to save them
from financial loss that the,
move is inaurgated. The Review \
into effect on the20th of this
feels that those who have here
tofore enjoyed the privilege of
the free list will cheerfully ac
cept the new conditions that go
into effect on ifie 20th of this
month.
