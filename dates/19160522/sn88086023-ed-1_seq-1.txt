Statement is Made of Cash
Used for Votes in Electing
Miss Saling as Rose Queen
Unable, apparently, to comprehend
the aMIIty of Pendleton to raise
enough money to purchase mure than
seven million votes for the election of
her candidate tor qaeen of the Rose
Festival, t'orvallls Is reported to have
raised the howl of "frame-up" und to
have communicated her "peeve" to
Eugene.
Yesterday R. P. Richardson, man
ager of the festival contest, wrote to
Pendleton asking for a statement of
the money raised here and for other
Information for publication to clear
up the false charges. Members ol
the committee In charge met yester
day afternoon with Secretary Cran
ston of the Commercial Association,
who acted us munuger, and prepared
a detailed statement of receipts and
disbursements, together with certain
explanations. This was forwarded last
evening.
The statement shows that there wns
collected in all. during the campaign
$1295 and that of this amount $1286.35
was spent for votes. The balance was
used for Incidental expenses such us
postnge, telegraph and telephone tolls
With the exception of $24 spent for
votes at the regular rate of one dot
lar a thousand and $50 spent during
"Button Week" at the rate of 2000
votes for a dollar, all of the balance,
or $1212.35, was spent during the ten
days In which the special rate of 6000
for one dollar was offered. The com
mittee took a gambler's chance In
passing up the first special of 2000 for
one dollar to wait for something bet
ter which they suspected would fol
low toward the end of the contest. Al
so the committee advanced the am
ounts whlcjh they considered would
be taken In at the Bingham Springs
benefit and the second benefit dance
In order to place the money during
the time of the big offer. They guess
ed so well as to the amount which
j would be received that there was a
difference of only a few dollars to
make up.
I The charge of "frame-up" does not
I sit well upon Pendleton after she his
I paid the price of her success. The
local committee feels that the contest
was conducted entirely "on the
square" and points out that the ma.i
' agement of the contest was In no po-
sltlon to play false for the reason that
the big majority of Miss Saling's votes
were purchased by Portland friends of
the commute without disclosing tor
whom the votes would be cast.
Moreover, Secretary Cranston states
in his letter to Mr. Richardson, the
committee could have raised $2500 Just
us easily as it dtd the J12S0 had it
considered that amount necessary
anil. In this connection, he points out
the fact that the $Ju raised by sub
scription by the publicity committee,
was secured In a three hour canvass.
Neither the Round-up nor the Com
mercial association vrus asked to con
tribute a cent us it was considered, in
the event of victory, that these organ
izations would probably lie called up
on for assistance in seeing that the city

O'clock when a violent wind storm
blew down the temporary enclosure,
which had been erected in front of

The wooden enclosure had been
built us a protection to the front of
the store during the remodeling. Miss
Hoch and her escort. Xed Fowler,
well known high school athlete, were
passing by the store Just as a partic

building. The enclosure was torn
louse und toppled over upon them.
Young Fowler protected the young
lady from the full force of the falling
lumber but both were carried down.
Miss Hoch was struck in such a way
that both bones of the leg were brok

Ready to Launch
Boom for Colonel
NEW YORK, May 22. The regulur
republicans opened their headquarters
for a Roosevelt boom today. The
Rnoseveltians are all former Taft
men. No progressives are among
them. They plan to shortly move the
headquarters to Chicago. George Von
Meyer, chairman of the delegation,
has an appointment with the colonel
this afternoon. It was believed that
Roosevelt would stump the middle
west soon.
Hughes' secretary denied the print
ed story in which it was said that
Hughes declared the republicans will
nominate Roosevelt, so there was no
use In considering anybody else. It
was said that Hughes did not recog
nize Irresponsible rumors. The jus
tice remains quiet, apparently Indif
ferent regarding his candidacy.

Dr. Doney expressed the great nei

He said that all things come from the

the soul forever. He said that all

the material side of life but also in
the spiritual side; that we should at
