ifront In the course of severe fight
ling last night.
Tho struggle west of Dead Man
hill wrb terrific. The war office

Houses Abandoned.
The block houses in Avocourt

East or the Meuse Infantry light
ing occurred at tho Haudremout
quarries, coptured yesterday by the
JFronch. The Gummas attacked these
.positions and tho statement asserts
'were repulsed with heavy losses.
The battlo of Verdun, the longest
and most bitterly conteotcd struggle
of tho war, entered on Its fourth
.month today. Tlie Germans are
lhanimering at Dead Man hill, where
the most furious and bloody fighting
of tho three months' conflict has
(taken place. Clinging desperately to
tho trenches that they have wrested
Jrom the French on the lower slope
or tho hill the Teutons have hurled
60,000 men backed by sixty battar
Iob ot guns of all callbcrs forward
along a seven mile front from Avo

Germans Got FiKitliolu.
As has been usual In this war
when olther sido lost a well prepared
and strongly delivered offensive at-';
tacking forces have won initial ad-,
'?vantages. Tho Oormans havo suc
ceeded in gaining a footing in tliei
French first lino at a cost or severe
_ losses. However, Judging from the
^ exporlonou of tho past it will not be
? a (limoult task for the Frenoh to dts-!
lodge thorn borore they are able to i
follow up their advantage. Both
sides will then roturn to their former
popts to await anotbor offensive.
That the Oormans must continue
their tromoudou'i onslaught on Dead
Man hill or abandon the idea of
taking Verdun seems obvious. This
blood-sonlted summit and Its sister
emiaenco, Hill Nd. 304, form the key
the whole system of Verdun's de
foil sofl i
The fire from their batteries flanks
the Douaumont plateau across tho
river. Without the undisputed po
sitions ot this plateau military critics i
agreo that no attack on Verdun has I
any chance ot success. i
