short story wont to Grafton. Tlio oc

places wbh to tell the people that
an effort is being made by tho liquor

Crabee, superintendent
of the Anti-Saloon League of West
Virginia, proceeded Mr. Blue with a
short address, in,which he gave sta
tist cs to demonstrate tho bencllts ac
cruing to the people or this state as
a result of the operations of the Yost!
law.
Mr. Bli^e, in a general way, outlln-,
ed the plan adopted by the "liquor
ring to accomplish its alleged pur-1
pose, and then cited incidents, facts I
and figures to prove to his listeners |
the fallacy of trying to make the citi
zens of West Virginia believe that I
they made a mistake when they voted i
for state-wide prohibition.
Mr. Bluo said that the head of a I
big lumber concern in this state, which
ts paving annually over $5,000 into
the state Workmen's Compensation I
fund, told him only a few hours be-1
rore that the conditions in their lum- j
per camps have po much improved
since the state went fry that his
company would gladly pay; four times
tne amount it Is now contributing to
tne fund rather than to return to
former conditions.
.AJIr- B,ue Baid that there wore 26,
000 more men employed in the mines
and industries In this state than dur
!!!?. u days and tl,0USh that
this should effectually upset the
charge that workingmen and their fam
ilies were leaving the state on ac
count of prohibition.
One of the statements made by tho
whiskey interests, he said, was that,
? wa? bankrupt as a result'
?rVn,^?8n0f revonuc formerly gained !
from the liquor traffic. To offset this
Mr. Blue stated that the bank de
posits in the state show an increase
of over 5 per cent, that there ha8 been I
more money expended for road im-;
provement and schools and that
there is now more money available for
both roads and schools than ever in
the history of the state.
Mr. Blue said he did not ask fori
any change in the Yost law but sought I
the moral support of all good citizens I
of the stato .u th* law's enforcement, j

Workmen started tearingjip several

replaced by new ones. Both sides of i
the bridge will be repaired. 1
fighting of the three months* con
flict has taken place. Clinging desper
ately to trenches that they have wrest
ed from French on lower slopes of
the hill the Teutons have hurled 60,
00 men back by 60 batteries of guns
of all calibres forward along a 7
mile front from Avocourt wood to the

That the Germans must continue
their tremendous onslaught on Dead
Man hill or abandon the idea of taking
Verdun seems obvious.
This blood-soaked summit and its
sister Eminence. Hill 304. form the
key of the whole system of Verdun's
defenses.
The fire from their batteries flanks
the Douaumont plateau across the
river. Without the undisputed pos
session of this plateau military critics
agree that no attack on Verdun has
any chance of success.
