M More startling, however, is the

If true, and the story Is well

conveys a terrible lesson to the

As early as Nov. 1, lit 15, cer

In there a man in the
world whose love for a
woman is so grc it that con

doing cannot shake his love
r anil faith in her.
There Is a film at the Apollo
theater this week that says there
are such men.
"God's Country and the Wom

day films of envy, suspicion aud
painted love, and warms the movie
fan's heart with a red-blooded
I picture of the value of a man's
devotion.
The filmed version of James
Oliver Garwood's book is one in
a thousand for plot, acting and
great scenic effects.
No Sappy Goodness.
It is not a milk and wator story
of sappy goodness. The blood of
strong men is split in the snow
carpeted forests of God's Country
in telling how the big-hearted
woman and the man of unlimited
faith find their happiness.
The spirit of the great north
west flames in the hearts of the
woodsmen In their devoted fight
for the woman.
When Philip Weyraan found
the only woman in the world in
great trouble he told her he would
do anything in the world for her.
He meant it, too, and when she

■ Without knowing the reason for
her request, or the cause of her

"This is only part of the trou

rradle, and in the cradle was —
a baby.
"I have seen the baby, and it

The truth was that the baby

In December the first Russian

Uenj. \V. Sherwood, one of the
attorneys for the defense, was
the last witness. He told of the
marriage of the young couple
and denied that he acted as at

parents, and the Lyens at the
same time.

Attorney Hart misunderstood
the word. He asked Lyen to re

"Chicken!" Lyen shouted.

two questions in one.
"There you go with your dou

Lyen would protest.
Most of the questions asked

Mrs. Lyen testified she has vis

"What conversation did you

"I wanted him to come back

Letters from Japan now cleai
up the mystery.
The four hundred thousand
Russian soldiers now on French
soil were conveyed from Vladi
vostok and Port Arthur by tlie
Japanese navy. They went ii
three separate expeditions, arouiu
India anil through the Suez ca
nal. The first expedition wai
comparatively small, the seconc

ing men.
A fourth expedition is now or

In this wonderful feat is a ter
rible lesson to America. Japan
has proved that she can trans

"You saw Aldeen again in Octo

"She had a picture of the baby
and she wanted me to look at It."
"Did you look at It?"
"1 did not."
"Why didn't you?"
Babies Don't Interest Her
"I never saw a picture of a
2-month-old baby that was at in
terest to rue."
Mrs. Lyen contradicted all tes
timony that Aldeen ever called
up on the phone and asked for
Lewis, occasionally having Mrs.
Lyen tell her eon to "call up Al

She denied that Esther Aldeen
had ever begged that Lewis be
brought buck to her and to the
baby.
"What did she come to your
home two times for, then?" was
asked.
"1 guesß she just wanted to see
what I looked like," she replied.
She said she did not give her
consent; did not attend the wed

to have him come back.

WASHINGTON', 1). C, May
22.—Numerous and uncer
tain are the possibilities to be
foreseen in the double-head
ed republican - progressive
presidential conventions to be
held June 7 in Chicago.
Here are the obvious ones:
Both conventions MAY nom
inate Theodore Roosevelt.
The republican convention
MAY nominate Charles E.
Hughes.
The republican convention
MAY nominate any of the fol
lowing: Burton, Weeks, Fair
banks, Root. Sherman, MeCall.
The republican convention
MIGHT nominate Borah, Cum
mins or La Follette.
The republican convention
MIGHT nominate Brig. Gen.
Leonard Wood, "dark horse."
The progressive convention
MIGHT (not likely) nominate
Charles E. Hughes.
The progressive convention
MAY nominate Roosevelt against
Hughes; or against any of the
Burton, Weeks, MeCall class of
candidates.
Roosevelt MAY refuse to take
a nomination from the progres
sive convention. In ease the re
publicans name a "satisfactory"
candidate. He only can say what
candidate would he "satisfao
tory."
THEN:
The progressive convention
MAY nominate Hiram Johnson,
Victor Mttrdock. William Allen
White, Henry Allen or Gilford
Pinchot.
These are a few of the obvloua
possibilities. The uncertalntlee!
of the situation hang on two
questions:
1. What will the reaction- '
ary republican I muses deride
to do with their hand picked
convention?
2. What will Roosevelt
finally deride to do?

In case the republican bosses,
a little more cautious, should de

Hughes takes the nomination?
And would Roosevelt endorse
him or run against him?
No human being except Roose

the problem up to him.
Tin* situation- is esnentiat
ty dramatic. Roosevelt holds

hiiil Hughes, with the repub
lican txisses, holds an equal
-1 ly coercive whip hand over

without the other.
For Hughes to enter a cam
paign against Wilson without the
cordial support of Roosevelt
would be suicidal. So, if Roose
velt entered a campaign as the
candidate of the progressive party
with some man as strong as
Hughes against him, he would al
most Inevitably be beaten.
The result would be the same
