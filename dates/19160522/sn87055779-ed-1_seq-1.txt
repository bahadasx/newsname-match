HOMES OF BABIES
Eighteen Hundred Flags Dis
tributed to Parents of Chil
dren Born Within Year.
Kighteen hundred pennants just
as many as there are babies in South
Bend born since May, 1915, and duly
registered at the board of health
oflice were dstributed Monday
through the city schools. Bach
brother or sister of a baby one year
old or under was presented with one
of these pennants, souvenirs of
South Bend's first Baby Week, and
instructed to display it conspicuously
during the week in honor of the
baby. The pennants were to have
been distributed Saturday by a large
committee of club women working
through the city with the birth regis
trations as guides, but this plan was
found impractical owing to the fact
that many of the families had moved
or many of the little lives had been
sacrificed to conditions which Baby
Week has been instituted to correct.
The pennants are bits of canvas
20 inches long with the Baby Week
dates and slogan "Better Babies.
Better South Bend" printed in royal
blue, blue and white being the Baby
Week colors. The distribution of
similar pennants has been a feature
of most of the civic celebrations in
some 2.000 communities all over the
United States this spring. They have
served two purposes, to do honor to
the baby and to discover many baby
births that were not registered in
the board of health oflice.
The big idea is that South Bend's
IIa by w eek begins today. A Baby
week is an event in which "His1 High
ness" the Baby, reisns supreme.
Kveryone who has a baby bring the
infant into the public spotlight and
find out if hi or her baby is the
most perfect of the species.

Italy Likely to Enter Protest
Against Participation of
Vatican in Negotiations.
I n tern id ion. il News Service:
ROMH, May 22. There are strong
indications that Italy will protest vig
orously against participation in
peace negotiations by the Vatican.
The two questions whether the
pope has a right to be admitted to
the peace congress, and whether
Italy will formally oppose the admis
sion of delegates of the Holy See,
are the subjects of a highly inter
esting debate on the part of a num
ber of prominent men in public life.
The conclusion arrived at shows
that only the iirst question can be
settled in a way entirely favorable
to the Vatican. As to the second it
appears that besides being of an ex
tremely delicate nature it is also
doubtful of solution.
Signor Rrnesto Nathan, former
mayor of Rome and leader of the
anti-clerical party in Italy, main
tains that the pope, as head of a
church, has no place in n peace con
gress unless the belligerent nations
are ready to grant the same priv
ileges to heads of other churches
wnose communicants have in small
or large numbers participated in the
war.
With regard to the second question
Signor Nathan holds that the pres
ence of delegates from the Holy See
would be both an offense to Italy
and dangerous to Italy's interests.
View of Pope's Hiclits.
Sen. Kugene Yalli. professor of in
ternational law at the University of
Rome, takes the view that the pvpe,
holding rights not possessed by the
archbishop of Canterbury and the
heads of other churches, could be
admitted to the peace congress as
the dispossessed ruler of the church
states.
Sen. Valli also contends that the
pope could ask for admission to the
peace congress as the highest relig
ious authority possessing a univer
sal character, and in order to secure
such measures as to guarantee its
absolute independence, as well as the
continuity of his work.

Attack Proposed
Federal Board to
Censor Pictures
Iutornation.il News Service:
W.SHLc;toN. May 22 A vig
orous attack on the proposed moving
picture censorship bill was contain
ed in a minority report on the meas
ure submitted to the house today by
four members of the house educa
tion committee. The report declares
that the establishment of a feder.il
board of censors would "stretch the
implied power of congress under the
constitution to tho breaking point."
The report was signed by Rep".
Rucker of Missouri; Powers of Ken
tucky, Piatt of New York, and Ibil-
linger of Massachusetts.
"The most seriou? objection to this
hill," says the report, lies in the
power it seeks to give an executive
commission to trammel the moving
picture art, the propagandist power
of which is marvelously developed
and the potential power of which
seems limitless."
"Those manufact urers who favor
the bill represent a very insignificant
proportion of the output." says the
report. "The attitude of this minor
ity is naturally and frankly selfish
and commerriaj. They believe it
would bo less expensive and trouble
some to deal with the perchance
control a single federal censorship
commission than to deal with or con
trol the several state authorities."
"In our opinion." tho report con
cluded, "every reasonable protection
to the public morals can be secured
by the proper exercise of the local
police power supplemented by an
amendment to the federal penal
code, including moving pictures in
the list of articles barred from inter
state commerce for stated causes.
The extraordinary power Nested in
the proposed commission will not
only prove ineffective to protect
public morals, but is utterly un
American in its character and in the
highest degree dangerous from any
point of view."

tion of Augustine Rirrell. the former
secretary for Ireland, that lit aked
for I'.ritish troops in Ireland to
overawe the Sinn Feiners. but va
refused by the war oltice was denied
today. The denial was container! in
a letter which was read when the
royal commission investigating the
causes of the uprising resjme.i its
session. The letter, which was writ
ten by Adjt. Cen. Macready of the
I'.ritish army, was read y Lord

sion. It stated that a confereiu bad
been held at the war ot!b on
March 2'J. at which Mr. Rirrell and
Iyord Wimborne. former lord lieuten
ant of Ireland, took part, but it re
lated solely to the recruiting situa
tion. According to Adjt. Cen. Macready
a proposal was made at that time to
send troops to Ireland, bu. the pur
pose was merely to stimulate re
cruiting and not to put fear of the
I'.ritish government into the he.trt
of the Irih volunteers, as the arn.e.J
organization of the Smn Reinrs was
known.
The war o'!i e turned down the
proposal he' a u.-e it did r.ot consider
that the res Jits would e-u il to

It was admitted that Mr. fhrrell
