MOST SUCCESSFUL TEAR
TO I AUSPICIOUS END
The closing exercises of what has
been the most successful year, of the
Ocala high school are taking place in
the Temple theater this afternoon and
evening.
The auditorium of the theater i3
gaily decorated in the class color3,
purple and gold; the colors being
draped over the boxes, and '. around
the front of the - balcony. On the
stage are pots of palms, ferns and
large bunches of golden daisies,
massed so that the green and yellow
alternate. Standing out among these
decorations are clusters of white
carnations, the class flower..
The exercises began at 2:30, Prin
cipal Cassels in charge. The theater
was well filled with friends of the
graduates, who proceeded with; their
essays and orations. The essays of
three of the young ladies will be
found in today's , paper, and the
others will be published as fast as
possible. -
Miss Sidney Harold prettily. bade
all welcome in the following words:
Welcome Address by Miss Sidney
Harold :
Kind Friends, Members of the Fac-
; ulty, Fellow Students and CJass
mates: As president of the senior class of
1916,- the honor and privilege of wel
coming you to ourl graduating exer
cises is assigned to me. The presi
dency of this, the largest ; class to
graduate from the Ocala high school,
has carried with it many honors, but
of them all, there is none that 1 es
teem m&re highly than the privilege
of extending to you a most cordial
and hearty welcome. v-' -
It has been the custom of the for
mer graduating classes to hold their
commencement exercises in the eve
ning, but-we have set asidethe prece
dent, and are Tiolding "Class After
noon" in addition, in the hope that
we may multiply -your pleasures
while dividing your time. The large
number in our class made some
changes necessary. Each ..aspiring
graduate was quite anxiou3 to speak
his or her little piece, but each :ould
not get the floor in one evening and
eave any time for other important
matters, so the problem was solved
by arranging for two exercises,
therefore I have the pleasure of bid
ding you welcome to "Class After
noon." r "
First of all I welcome our mothers
and fathers, who have always been
kind and encouraging, loving us at
all times, to you we realize is di e the
honor for this the greatest event of
our lives. We may never know what
sacrifices you have made in order
that we might be eligible to occupy
this important position today. . '
Kind friends I welcome you to
share our achievements and enjoy
our program. It is a 'great pleasure
to see so many here this afternoon,
and it is especially encouraging to
know that so many are interested in
our welfare. It was the anticipation
of your presence here today that gave
us the inspiration to "; prepare this
program to the best of our ability.
These sixteen genial smiling faces
around me speak for themselves, and
even better than T, bid you the very
heartiest welcome. So now ladies
and gentlemen you know ths.t you
are welcome.
WILL COACH PUPILS
I will take about ten pupils, from
any of the grades in the Ocala high

ley's troops south of Bouquillas. The

horne with two troops of cavalry is

to send the Sixth cavalry in the bis

MR. NASH MISQUOTED
President of the Council Says that the
Information He Gave Regarding
'the Sewerage System was Obtained
, from Bryan & Co.s Engineer .
President Nash, in a statement
made this morning, says that he was
quoting Engineer Spanner of Bryan
& Co., when he told council that only
11 out of 50 of the flush tanks of the
new sewerage system could be flush
ed with the waterworks facilities now
provided for.
Mr. Nash says: "In Saturday's is
sue of the Star the statement was
made that Councilman Nash said that
out of 50 flush tanks only 11 could be
connected with the water mains. The
facts in the case are "that, Mr. Spar-
mer, engineer for- the Bryan com
pany, stated to me that only these
flush tanks could be connected.
"Since that time the city engineer
and superintendent of water works
have ascertained that 25 other con
nections can be made by connecting
to small pipes not mains, within an
average distance of half a block.
"These connections will at once be
made, and I am very glad that we are
better off than we at first led to
believe through the statement of Mr.
Sparmer." ; '

a newspaper states that he was mar
ried in Augusta.
If Mr. Geise has been married it
will be a pleasant surprise to all of
his friends here, who have nothing
but best wishes for him and his bride.

Says De La Vergne Apparatus
Must Meet Specifications
IF EVERY DIS0RUFITLE8 BIDDER
DELAY WILL DE
The city this morning received a
letter from Twombley & Henney, en
gineers for the light and water plant,
with regard to the De La Vergne oil
engine, wmcn uouncuman lompKins
referred to in council Thursday night
as not meeting the requirements of
the insurance underwriters. The en
gineers do not answer, the particular
point raised by Mr. Tompkins, but
state that the engine will ' have to
meet the requirements of the speci
fications and contract for the new
plant. The city clerk's telegram to
the engineers did not state the nature
of the charge made against the en
gjneV nor who had made the charge.
rne letter irora xwomDiy & tten
ney, after calling attention to the
fact that the telegram had not given
the specific charge, says in reference
to the matter.
"We feel that it is only fair to our
selves at this time to say that in se
lecting the apparatus for your com
bined electric light and water plant,
we have given careful consideration
to the plant as a whole, so that its
operation as a complete plant would
be as economical as possible, and at
the same time give satisfactory per
formance. Included in the apparatus
recommended - by -usia-lhe.. specifica
tions, which specifications were ap
proved by vote of the city council, is
the De La Vergne oil engine or its
equal. The contract was awarded to
Benjamin Thompson for all the ap
paratus including the De La Vergne
oil engine. There are more oil en
gines of this type giving satisfactory
service in operation in the United
States that of any other make of oil
engine. If the manufacturers of
other types of oil engines are to be
permitted to bring charges against
the De La Vergne engine, which
charges are to be taken up by the city
council and considered, by them,
there will . be no end to this sort of
trouble. The city is entirely pro
tected in the purchase of this engine
as it wilf not receive our approval as
engineers until erected and until it
performs in accordance with the spec
ifications, and the contract. If it does
so perform nothing more can be re
quired and the city will have a first
class oil engine equipment.
"The council can readily under
stand that if action of the kind indi
cated in your telegram is to be en
couraged, disgrunted bidders on all
kinds of apparatus for this plan will
be continually coming to the council
with charges, which when sifted' out
amount to nothing, but which will
have required on our part the expen
diture of time and money. The coun
cil has selected us as their engineers,
and as stated before, we have given
careful consideration to the apparatus
best suited to the needs of the city,
and have recommended apparatus
which we believe to be best suited to
their needs, and we fel that the coun
cil should allow the work to proceed
without unnecessary interference and
await final tests to determine whether
the apparatus will be accepted or re
jected."
The agent of the De La Vergne en
gine company will probably be here
shortly to answer any questions that
the council may ask.
ANOTHER CLUE TO THE
HIGH SCHOOL VANDAL
What appears to be a further clue
to the party guilty of trying to de
stroy the gutters on the roof of the
high school building is given in a let
ter just received from the Groover
Stewart Drug Co., of Jacksonville.
The letter states that a Jackson
ville company purchased a gallon of
nitric acid from the drug company
about the time of the incident here.
Three quart bottles that had contain
ed nitric acid bearing the label of the
drug company were found at the
school building. It is said that the
said company contends that the acid
purchased by it was in" a gallon bot
tle. The drug company has not clear
ed this point up yet, it is said.
