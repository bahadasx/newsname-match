Gen. Gorringe Carries Redoubt of Left
Bank But Ottomans Hold Other
Side of Stream.
London, .May 21. A force of Russian
cavalry has joined the British army on
the Tigris, in Mesopotamia. An of
ficial communication issued tonight
concerning the situation along the
Tigris follows:
"General Lake reports that on May
11 the enemy vacated the Bothaiessa
advanced position on the right bank of
the Tigris. General Gorringe, follow
ing up the enemy, attacked and carried
the Dujailani redoubt. The enemy is
still holding the Sanuayyat position
the left bank of the river.
"A lorce of Russian cavalry has
joined General Gorringe alter a bold
and adventurous ride."
The lirst news of the operations on
the Tigris since the fall of Kut-el-Atnara,
sent today by Lieutenant (Ien
eral Sir I'erey Lake, commander of the
British forces in Mesopotamia, al
though it. shows that tho Turks are
still holding the Sannayyat position on
the left bank of the Tigris, where the
ISritish cheek made it impossible to
carry out the relief of General Towns
hend, brings the astonishing intelli
gence that a body of Russian cavalry
has succeeded in joinging General
Gorringe's forces.
J low this important junction was ef
fected is still unknown, and the story
will be awaited with intense interest.
The supposition is that this detach
ment came from the Russian army
which is threatening Khanikan. but it
still remains a puzzle where and how
the Russians succeeded in crossing the
live:.
Their sudden appearance with Gen
eral Gorringe has also raised the ques
tion whether the Russians have al
ready cut the liau'dad railway at
Mosul.
London. May 21. The battle before

Purity Gives Power
There are still many persons in the

the fact that the purer the blood is the

less likely to take cold or to be long

have taken 3S.O0O prisoners.

Berlin by wireb'ss to Sayville, May
. Tlie ollicial Austrian icports of
Friday and Saturday show further ex
tensive gains in the new offensive
mevtment in the southern Tyrol,
which lias carried the Austrians on
Italian territory. The statement of
Saturday records the expulsion ol the
Italians from Col Santo ridge south
east of Rovereto and important cap
tures of men and guns. (A summary
of this statement was received by
cable on Saturday night.)
The text of the communication is
as follows: Austro-liungarlan at
tacks drove the enemy further back
on the front in southern Tyrol and
in the Sugana valley. Austro Hun
garians entered Roneeguo. On Ar
mentara ridge Austro-liungarian
troops captured Sasioalto, Passo della
Vena, Tonessa, and Monte Mellgone,
oust of the conquered fortified position
ot Campoinlon. At this point the
Italians gathered their forces hastily
for a counter attack but they were
repulsed immediately. The Italians
also were diiven from Col Santo.
ince the beginning ot the Austro-
Hungarian attack we have captured
7 Italian Ollicers and more than
12.1'iie men. UK machine guns and 1 07
cannon, including 12 howitzers of 2S
centimeters.
Home. May 22. Gen. Paolo Morrone.
minister of war, alter a protracted
council meeting attended bv cabinet
ministers issued a statement concern
ing the military situation in connect
ion with the Austrian offensive
which will have the Italian supreme
command perfectly tranquil." The
plans of the Italian military authori
ties cannot be divulged, but it can be
stated that measures have been adopt
ed to cope wit!) any possible situation.
In addition to direct action on the
Italian front, it is expected that a gen
eral offensive movement against the
Austrians will be made on other fronts
especially in the llalkaus and in Russia
and in addition a contemporaneous at
tack is expected to be sprung by Italy's
allies in France. Meantime military
clitics, including Gen. Morroiio, advise
restricting the Italian front by aban
doning tin' far-advanced positions, in
order to be better able to repulse the
ustrlans, whose lorward move along
the Trentino lront already has lasted
a week. Ibis action Is a repetition of
what Austrian generals did more than
a century ago when Napoleon attacked
Austria from the Isonzo river.
The Austrian staff, it is believed,
hopes to invade Italy along the Adige
river valley, thus forcing the Italians
to abandon their offensive on the
(astern front for fear of having their
main at my taken in the rear. For
this attack Austria, which had 20 di
visions on the Italian front, augment
ed them by 12, six of which were
drawn from Servia and six iron) the
Russian f rent.

HI DEPUTIES
Missed Officials But Puts Bullet
Through Horse's Head
MERRITT CULVER IN JUL
Shocting Follows Attempt of Authori
ties to Carry Oue Provisions of
Guardianship.
Deputy Sheriff James D. Purdy and
his hired man Walter Field were fired
upon and one of Purdy's horses was
killed at eight o'clock this morning on
the Culver place at Fast Dorset when
Meiritt Culver resented the presence
of Purdy and his man on the place and
attempted to drive them with an old
Springfield rifle.
Culver, with his father and mother,
ire under charge of court guardians,
Alvin Waters and Michael Casey of
Manchester Center, and he held the
mistaken idea, officials say, that if he
could keep anyone from working his
place that he would be supported by
the court. Both guardians lately de
cided that Culver's threats about al
lowing anyone, even his guardians, on
the place had reached the point where
they should be aftorded protection if
they were to continue to serve. Con
sequently Sheriff Purdy and his man
were employed to make some of the
fields reaily for planting.
At eight o'clock this morning Field
drove on to the Culver place with a
load of manure and one of the Culver
family .saw him. Merritt Culver was
sent for where he was working in a
ower lot. He came to the house, pro
cured his Springfield rille and from
the inside of the kitchen shot at Field
as he was driving last. The first bill-
t went between the horses and
wagon.
Sheriff Purdy was in the vicinity di
recting the work. He sent for Deputy
Sheriff Charles Norcross who held
more influence with Culver, who is
both deaf and dumb. Meanwhile Purdy
stayed around to see no further shoot
ing at his team occurred.
Meantime Purdy determined to see
what he could do alone. As an alter
cation was plainly audible in the house
Purdy drew near, keeping close to the
side of the house to avoid being potted
if Culver had not done shouting. Cul
ver saw him coming and swung his
gun in Purdy's direction yet at the
same time keeping within the protec
tion the kitchen walls afforded. This
undoubtedly saved the deputy sheriff
Irom serious injury for Culver's in
ability to train the gun directly on the
sheriff on account of the door casing,
resulted in the. second shot passing
through the sheriff's coat-tails.
Purdy's team had to pass by the
house again to get to the road and out I
of danger. Purdy shouted for his man :
to go ahead and tackle Culver in the 1
kitchen with a revolver. Before he
could got his man, however, Culver had
crossed to the rear of the kitchen and
sent a ball through the head of one of
the horses that Field was attempting
to drive arouiui the back way. J
The horse was instantly killed. Its
value was about $2."0.(m. j
Norcross arrived in time, however, 1
to get Culver's attention and reason
with him. He persuailad Culver to
give himself up, stating he would fix
Culver's - bail. Between the two olli
cets Culver's gun was secured and he
was quickly taken into custody, bundl
ed into Purdy's automobile and
brought to Bennington where lie was
locked up.
Both Culver and his parents are
mutes and the cause for the shooting
was the mistaken idea that the work
ing of their farm by outsiders some
how jeopardized the aid they were
getting from the court.
