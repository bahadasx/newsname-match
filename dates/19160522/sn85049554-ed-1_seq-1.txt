A neutral diplomat who baa iust re

saying the. Austrians have withdrawn
60,dOO troops from Albania within the

'small detachments to guard the towns
they have occupied, leaving a garrison
of SOft atFleja and 60©at Berat. The
remainder of the troops left in the
country are concentrated at Durazgo.
The abandonment of the Albanian
front is Hold to be due tto 'the impos

Washington, May 22—Indications to
day were that senate action on con

Brandeis to the supreme court and
George Bublee as & member of the
federal trade commission would be im
portant features of the week's con
gressional program.
A forerunner of the fight on Mr.
Rublee was imminent in the Benate to
day. The question* was whether the
senate would hold an open Instead of a
secret session tomorrow when It re
considers the voto on Mr. Rublee's
nomination.
The proposal to abandon executive
action in the senate was borne by
resolutions of Senators Kenyon and
LaFollette.
The rivers and harbors appropria

day, with Kenyon and Sherman still
intent on continuing their fillibuster.
