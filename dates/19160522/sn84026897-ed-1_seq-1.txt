Dr. John E. White of Anderson,
~Was to have delivered the address

cently undergone an operation
which will prevent his coming. This
is a great disappointment to all, not
to hear Dr. White but Rev. Segers
has consented to remain over and
deliver the address, which will be
learned with pleasure, for Mr. Se
gers is a fine and eloquent speaker.
Mrs. Mattie Denny will go to
Spartanburg next week to attend
.?the graduation of her daughter,
Miss Antoinette Denny, at Converse
college.
Rev. and Mrs. Brock arrived
from Danville, Va., on Wednesday
and a coi dial welcome was given

demiciled in the parsonage which
had been made ready for them.
There was a generous pounding by
the members, and the pantry looked
tempting.
On Sunday morning Rev. Brock
filled the pulpit of the Baptist
church, using as a text from Acts
22, this verse, "What shall I do
Lord?" the theme of his discourse
being "The consecrated life." Mr.
Brock is an earnest, effective and
magnetic speaker, and holds his
hearers with rapt attention. He is a
man called of God 'id his coming
^here and identifying himself as the
under Shepherd of these people,
will bring forth much good.
_._A^_nnioii welcome^jseryice was
p!?eTd on^Sunday " evening, Rev.
Thacker of the Methodist church
and ?ev. Kester of the Lutheran
church calling in their services, and
all worshipping at the Baptist
church and these two extended a
most cordial welcome to the new
pastor in behalf of their churches.
Rev. Brock responded feelingly and
said that every hour since he and
his family had arrived there had
been some evidence of good will
and welcome.
On Wednesday evening an infor
mal reception will be held in the
Sunday school rooms of the Bap
tist church and it is hoped that
every member of the church will
be present to get better acquainted
with Rev. and Mrs. Brock.
Everyone is delighted that Miss
Sara Stevens is at home again, she
having just completed a most suc
cessful term "in the graded school
of McCormick.
Miss Mary Lucia Mobley has
been elected one of the assistant
teachers in the music department of
Coker college.
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Bland have
returned from their honeymoon and
are domiciled in the home of Mrs.
Hattie Parrieh.
Mrs. James White attended the
-musical festival at Spartanburg last
week.
Miss Elizabeth Shell who has
been teaching in the Hardy school
has returned to her home in Lau
rens, a very successful year having
ended.
^Miss Bell of Ellenton is the guest
of her sister, Mrs. W. P. Casselles.
An affair that was beautiful in
every detail was the five o'clock tea
given by Mrs. J. L. Walker in com
pliment to Miss Martha Watson,
whose marriage has been announced
for June 10. The hostess was assist
. ed by Misses Lucile Smith, Marion
MoWeyJand Mrs. Mims Walker, and
while the guests were arriving sweet
music was enjoyed. Each one was
asked to write a recipe and when
these had been gathered up they
were bound in a hand-painted book
let and presented to Miss Watson.
Later all were invited to the dining
room where everything was beauti
ful with the color motif of pink and
white. No cloth was used and pink
under the beautiful service mats,
and a huge bowl of Dorothy Per
kins roses formed the centerpiece.
Grape fruit was first served then
salads with other tempting viands

Horn's Creek.
(Written for last week.)
Horn's Creek and Edgefield have
formed a mutual admiration society.
Whenever the mission societies have
any members present from either of
the other societies, they immediate
ly begin to compliment each other.
On Monday afternoon, May 8,
a number of Horn's Creek society
members came over to the temper
ance-mission meeting at the Baptist
church, and on Saturday, Mrs. E.
P. Jones, Mrs. Tillman and Mrs.
Mims were invited to attend a meet
ing at the hospitable home of Mrs.
S. B. Mays. As soon as we arrived
they began to say that Edgefield
did such beautiful things in such a
beautiful way and how they had en
joyed the Monday afternoon meet
ing. Then began a most amiable
controversy over which would bear
off the laurels, Hom's Creek or
Edgefield. The Edgefield ladies de
clared unanimously that Horn's
Creek won the victory.
Mrs. Walter Miller is the belov
ed president of this society, and
a large number were present, con
sidering the church membership,
sufficient to fill Mrs. Mays' spacious
parlor.
Visitors also from Edgefield weri
Mrs. Sallie Moseley and Mrs. Ben
Jones, both of whom added good
cheer to the occasion, and also Mrs.
Walter Nicholson of the Berea so
ciety. Mrs. Miller read very feeling
ly a portion of scripture, and talks
were made|byMrs. Jones, Mrs. Till
man and Mrs. Mims.
At the close of the program a
lovely silk quilt was exhibited
which had been made by the ladies
of the society. Mr. P. B. Wise fell
heir to this lovely quilt, having
drawn the fortunate number.
The ladies were invited into the
diuing room aud refreshed in the
most delightful way, by a two course
luncheon, an elaborate salad conree
with ice tea and ice cream and
pound oake. This was -a delightful
social occasion, with the tables sur
rounded by loving and congenial
friends.
The quilt was sold for the benefit
of the fence around the cemetery
at Horn's Creek, brought ?16, and
Mrs. Jessie Crafton who had charge
of this was very grateful for all the
help she received. Mr. P. B. Wise
became the fortunate possessor of
the quilt.
Mrs. J. L. Mims.
Wheat Increase in the South.
Washington, D. C., May 16.
Commenting to-day on the report of
the United States Agricultural De
partment on the couditiou of winter
wheat as of May 1, President Har
rison, of Southern Railway Com
pany, said:
"From a Southern viewpoint it is
gratifying to note that, while the
department figures indicate that the
total crop in the United States will
be 155,765,?U? bushels below the
crop of last year, they indicate an
increase of 3,054,000 bushels in the
Southern States traversed by the
lines of Southern Railway Company.
Increases are shown for each of the
States of Virginia, Georgia, Ala
bama, Kentucky and Tennessee, and
slight decreases in the States of
North Carolina, South Carolina and
Mississippi. These figures afford
another illustration of the tendency
of Southern farmers to get away
from the one-crop system of farm
ing, and to strengthen the economic
position of the South by growing a
large proportion of its food supplies.
The same tendency is strikingly
shown by the marked increase in
the number and improvement in the
quality of live stock in every South
ern State, as was illustrated by a re
cent census of hogs in South Caro
lina, showing au increase of more
than 150 per cent, since 1910."
There was not even standing
room in the crowded car, for it was
at the rush hour, but one more pas
senger, a young woman, wedged her
way along just inside the doorway.
Each time the car made a sudden
lurch forward she fell helplessly
back, and three times she landed in
the arms of a large, comfoi table
man on the back platform. The
third time it happened he said,
quietly:

better stay here."-New York Jour

TRENTON LETTER.
High School Closes Profitable
Session. Prize Winning
Essays. L. T. L.
Held Meeting.
(Written for Last Week.)
The coming together of the com
munity for commencement exercises
is significant of deep meaning. It
proves that community spirit is
awakened, and nothing assists to
create this spirit or this inspiration
like a wide-awake-progressive-up-to
date school, such as we have had
for the past two years (this year
having pre eminence over last) un
der the able superintendence of Prof.
Scott and his excellent co-workers.
Misses Maude Moore, Sadie Long,
Ruth Salter and Mae Harrison. It
is, therefore, no wonder then that
long before the appointed hour on
Tuesday evening last the school
building wa? filled with happy par
ents, interested relatives and friends
to witness the culmination of the
year's work, and the hearty applause
with which each song, each drill,
each number was greeted evidenced
the fact that the greatest delight
and satisfaction prevailed. A play
entitled "The Hoodoo," was splen
didly presented by the High School,
and showed much skill and ability
in the performers. The following
was the program for the graduating
exercises Wednesday morning, the
crowd perhaps being larger than
that of the previous evening:
Song, "America."
Salutatory, James Spearman.
Essay, "Colonial Mothers or Co
lonial Days." (Prize essay for D.
A. R. Medal.)
Essay, "Value of Total Absti
nence to a Life." (Prize Essay for
W. C. T. U. Medal.)
Instrumental Duet, Grace Salter
and Mary H. Harrison.
Literary Address, Dr. Reed Smith
of Columbia, S. C.
Class Prophecy. Sue Mae Herlong.
- Instrumental Solo, Laurie Moore.
Class Will and Testament, Tom
Salter. .
Presentation of Medals.
Presentation of Certificates.
Valedictory, Marion Clarke.
Chorus, "Springtime."
The essay for the D. A. R. medal
was won by Miss Louise Padgett,
while Miss Mattie Lee Long was
winner of the medal for the W. C.
T. JJ. essay, the former being pre
sented by Rev. E. C. Bailey, the
latter by Rev. R. G. Shannonhouse.
It was a great privilege to hear
Dr. Reed Smith. By his philoso
phy and humor he held his hearers
fascinated.
In a few well chosen words Mr.
J. M. Van p. presented the certifi
cates to Misses Sue Mae Herlong
and Marion Clarke, Messrs. James
Spearman and Tom Salter.
When the program was concluded
a bountiful picnic dinner was en
joyed, and the afternoon given over
to base ball, two games having been
played between Graniteville and
Trenton, the latter being successful
ia both.
We deplore the fact that with the
closing of this scholastic year our as
sociation with Prof. Scott as an ed
ucator in the Trenton school ceases,
for he has had the welfare of the
school at heart for the past two
years, and has worked faithfully, and
theiesult ot his labor is in evidence.
The friends of Prof. Scott are heart
sick over his resignation as superin
tendent, realizing that the school is
in the midst of an era of prosperity
never before known in its history.
Tne Trenton High School undsr his
leadership has won a high place
among the schools of South Caro
lina, and his loss will be felt by the
whole county. It is also deeply re
f retted that Miss Maude Moore and
Miss Ruth Salter will not teach here
next session.
Mr. E. J. Lorrick and his daugh
ter, Mrs. Lloyd Preston, from Cres
cent City, are guests of relatives
here. In compliment to Mrs. Pres
ton, Mrs. S. A. Morrall entertained
three tables of rook on Friday af
ternoon. Most of the guests pres
ent were friends of Mrs. Preston in
their girlhood days, and many little
amusing incidents were recounted
that awakened fond memories of
the past. Mrs. Morrall's entertain
ments are usually marked by an
originality and cleverness peculiarly
her own, and this one was no excep
tion to her general rule. The com

Rain Needed. ?
D|ar Advertiser: Another week
gone'and no rain yet. It is distrpns
ingr, "the farmers hav'nt a stand of
anything up and it can't come up.
The gardens are burnt up, no vege
tables to cook, and harvest season
at hind. That means with us, lots
of hands to feed and nothing to
boilj?nakes meat, bread and pota
toes fly, with butter milk to wash
it down. We must be thankful we
have;that, for by the present out
look :Ve may not have that much.
The tK'tatoes cannot come up and the
pastures are drying up, so the cows
and hogs are in need of graas and
water, as the branches have gone
dry. 5 The oat crop generally suf
fered for rain and are not as good
as they would have been could we
have had rain.
Saturday last was the barbecue

tB? o?hg and hope to have that
pleasure often. ,
Mr. and Mrs. Roper Day and
their little family were down in
their new "Buick," Mr. and Mrs.
Dorian Swearingen were with them.
Miss Beatrice Stevens was running
her "Buick," Mr. Markeri and fam- i
ily in their "Dodge." The roads

Dr. Traylor Briggs has taken his
mother, Mrs. Ellie Briggs, sister
Mrs. Cobb Mathis and baby and
sister-in-law, Mrs. T. J. Briggs to
Pendergrass, Ga., to attend the com
mencement week, this "week. We
kno?- they will enjoy the trip, as
they are visiting Mrs. T. J. Briggs'
brother and family, Mr. Sohn Get
zen. Mrs. Briggs will be missed at
the missionary meeting Thursday,
which will meet with Miss Beatrice
Stevens. We hope to have a good
attendance and also to be able to
attend the Horn's Creek meeting
next Saturday.
Miss Mary Townes returned home
a week ago from her school at
Sheldon, S. C. She reports quite a
pleasant stay there. Mrs. Georgia
McKie took Mrs. Townes and Miss
Mary to Augusta last Tuesday
morning in her car and home for
dinner.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry McKie and
Mrs. Wyley Wells, motored to Au
gusta Saturday and made Mrs.

Mr. and Mrs. John DeLaughter
and Miss DeLaughter, from the
Red Hill section, visited Miss La
nier and Mm. Shaw last Friday,
then went to Augusta Saturday.
We were very glad to have Mrs.
DeLaughter with us on Sunday at
Hardy's church, and appreciate her
kindness in playing the organ for
us.
Were glad to welcome Mr. Os
mond Scott into our church on Sun
day. He is just home from the
Edisto school.
The North Augusta commence
ment lakes pls.ee May 30. We re
ceived an invitation from Miss
Harmony School Picnic.
The editor of The Advert?s
spent an exceedingly pleasant di
at Harmonv Saturday. At the clo
of the school-one of the be
schools in the county, or Sta
either, for that matter-followii
their custom of several years stan
ing the patrons and people of tl
community gave a neighborhoc
picnic, one of the kind for whit
Harmony has become far-fame
We arrived a little late, and were sn
prised to see 6uch a great thron
A larger number of buggies, carr
ages and automobiles one seldo
sees at a country gathering tha
were in the Harmony grove Satu
day.
As we drove up two ball tean
were measuring their strength an
skill on the athletic field, which li<
just east of the grove. The gan:
wa9 being umpired by Luther Smitl
whose decisions were fair and in
partial. In the acternoon the gan:
was finished, but we did not lear
the score.
The day was pascod very plea
antly by all present. Those wh
did not witness the game of ba
gathered in groups under the tree
and engaged in pleasant convers?
tion. Many of the ladies wer
seated in automobiles, while other
gathered in the church. Man,
young people preferred a tete-a-tet
to the groups, and in this way Cupii
got in some effective work for th
day.
Prof. Long hopes to have th
new school building by the openin?
of the session of 1916-1V. Plan
and specifications are now bein;
drawu by a competent architect
and as soon as these are compl?t?e
the contract will be let for thi
88,000 brick building. It will bi
located on an eminence east of th<
church, instead of the western edg<
of the beautilul grove where the ole
building stands. The location wil
be ideal, and this will be among th<
best rural school buildings in thi
State. We do not know of any
thing in this section 'anywhere tba
can at all approach it. It will b<
one of the best buildings in the
State, located in the heart of one ol
the best communities in the State,
presided over by some of the beal
teachers in the State, and back
pd by the best people in the State.
Being thus equipped and supported,
what is to prevent it from being one
of the very best schools in the State.
Prof. Long told The Advertiser's
representative Friday that another,
the fourth teacher, will be added
for the next session.
In spite of the great throng,
Harmony, as everybody knew would
be the ca6e, served a dinner on the
long table that wa9 practically lim
itless in quantity. Not only waa
the quantity bountiful, but the qual
ity and variety could not be im
proved upon. The hosts and hos
tesses of the school and community
did their part nobly and well in the
matter of dispensing hospitality and
entertaining their friends, but the
people themselves, at least some of
them, were impatient and crowded
more than usual about the table,
creating some confusion and mak
ing it difficult for those who served
the dinner.
A very pleasant day was spent at
Harmony by at least one thousand
people. Such an occasion is always
helpful, wholesome and uplifting,
and we know of no community or
people who are more generous or
more gracious than the good people
of Harmony. One reason for their
success in every undertaking is
found in the spirit of unity and co
operation that prevails in the com
munity. The community is well
named, as everything that is under
taken by its people is characterized
by the utmost Harmony.
Marjorie McKie, who is to graduate.
Many thanks to Miss Marjorie.
We received an invitation to at
tend the commencement of the
High School of Charleston where
Master Edward Bunch graduated
last week. He will attend the Cita
del next fall. We hope he may
spend a part of his vacation with us
this summer, a9 that is the only
time we can have our boy with us.
Messrs. Willie and. Charlie and
Miss Lucile Burkhalter and Miss
Sallie Hammond motored to Colum
bia Sunday.

liers is visiting her cousin, Miss

"UNCLE" IV WRITES.
-.-. /
Likes Letters of Mr. ' Wright*
Two Communications That
Pass Between "Uncle"
Iv and IV?r. Scott.
Well, old friend, I am still here
and feeling better thank you than
when I wrote you before. So I must
have been mistaken about the dry
weather and the dust making me feel
badly, as it is still dry and the
dust yesterday filled the air in
clcuds but we had a very light
shower of rain last night. Yesterday
evening everybody thought from the
looks of the clouds that a good rain
would surely fall. Even the little
ants quit work and when you saw
one it was traveling for its nest,
but both ants and man were dis
appointed. There is lying in the
south now a long bank of clouds
and we may get some rain yet be
fore the weather clears again. Oats
and wheat are about all cul, and in
most cases better than was expect
ed. Some late variety of wheat is
still green.
The cotton planted early in April,
even where the stand was not good, \
has been chopped and dined and
growing some and corn that had a
liberal fertilizer looks well and has
been worked out.
Mr. Editor, what has Russell
Wright been up to now? Is be the
man that struck Billy Patterson? If
he is he must be getting close on to
Methuselah in age and I would not
be surprised as Billy Patterson was
dead long ago. But still I can't ac
count for Wright being in Oconee
county, so near to Rabon county in
Georgia and near the line of North,
Carolina. Oh, yes, I see now, he is
after playing a Villa game and if
the sheriff in South Carolina gets
after him be can just step over into
North Carolina and before the au
thorities can agree in the two Caro
lina's he can ju8t step across into
Georgia and before papers or con
ferences can be had he can just get
him an aeroplane and sail to the
mountains and hide in a cave and
say: "Would like to see you get me
now." But I do wish Russell
Wright would write more, for I
nearly always look for something:
from him. I am not acquainted with
him at all only through The Adver
tiser but he was a soldier in the
Confederate aruiv and that tells the
story of why I like to hear from
him.
I am sending you a letter from
H. H. Scott, an old comrade of com
pany I, 2nd South Carolina cavalry.
Why do I send it? Because I some
times think there are people who do
not believe the old soldiers love
each other and I want them to read
a letter from one to another. I call
it one of my love letters for that is
what it is. I know it is. for I knovv
the man from whom it camp and
don't doubt his love for me. No not
one minute. I have answered his
letter and if the letter I send you is
printed in your paper I give him
permission to send my reply to you
to be printed if you see fit to do^so.
Well, there is to be a Sunday
school picnic at the church where
we attend tomorrow and I am look
ing forward to a pleasant day with
we young ones.

Mr. Scott's Letter.
' Dear "Uncle" Iv and Comrade:-1
have just finished rea ling your let
ter in The Advertiser and it is the
first time that I have seen where a
letter would reach you as I wanted
to write you and I am always glad
to hear from my comrades, and es
pecially those that belonged to com
pany I. That was near and dear to
me, as yo.u say the older we get the
more we think of each other. I have
hanging on the wallu of my house
in my hall several generals'jpictures
and when I get to Gen. Hampton's
as I look at them every day I shed
tears, as he was a true friend of
mine while I scouted for him. I
will never forget what be said to
the scouts two days before we sur
rendered. He sent for us and when
we got to him he said: ''Boys I have
sent fur you to tell you that we are
going to surrender, and I want to
go, and not be at the surrender, for
the Yankees may demand you. And
I want to bid each and every one of
you au affectionate farewell. Keep
away from the towns and go home
