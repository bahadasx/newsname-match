CONTRACT
BAFSiOHSST
SCORE OF I
11
"The present administration does not give a d about
saving money for the City of Bridgeport, but this board is out
to save money for the cry and has saved thousands of dol
lars," declared Dr. Robert J. Lynch, president of the board
of contract and supply to a committee of the board of educa
tion today. ' 1
The" committee consisting of John A.
Hurley, Robert D. Goddard and Louis
F. Schwertdle was recently appointed
to confer with the contract board and
see if the coal supply for the public
schools cannot be purchased more ad
vantageously and at cheaper rate than
the supply board'obtained last year by
asking for bids on the coal for all city
departments.
At the meeting .today it developed
that the contract board has asked for
bids on 9,000 tons of coal and that the
board had figured this would Include
coal endugfh for the year's supply for
the public schools.- The board of ed
ucation on its own Account had adver
tised for bids on 7,000 tons of coal.
Both the contract board and the school
boar.d have been informed by dealers
that because of labor troubles, freight
embargoes, - and other conditions aris
ing from the vast shipments of war
munitions now being made over the
eastern railroads they have 1 been un
able to obtain prices from, the mines
with which they do business. Hence
they are unable to quote prices or
make bids at this time.
The supply board had expected to
open bids on May 20. Clerk Baldwin
in view of the -representations made
by the local coal dealers extended the
time for opening bids from May 20
until May 24. Because the committee
of the board of education thought the
school board shouldbe given an op
portunity to see if it could not ' get
better prices for coal than the supply
board, it was decided after the con
ference this noon that the bids of the
supply board should stand and the
school "board seek -separate bids on
the coal. If the school board can get
a lower price, it will be allowed to
purchase its own coal. y j
' "TVia hnar nnlv wfl.nts to see the
r-itv -eet tne Dest nrices it ca.ii ir

day. "If your i committee can buy
coal cheaper than we can we will be
perfectly willing to have you do so,"
he said. ' .
Patrick McGee had "the contract in

coal delivered in quarter ton lots for
the charities department to the city
poor.
Commissioner Goddard asked - Dr.
Lynch if it wasn't true that the coal
dealers put in about the same bids.
The doctor denied this and Clerk
Baldwin read the figures of the past
years' bids- showing that they were
very mucE at variance and Mr. McGee
was low.
Dr. Lynch said that one dealer has
insinuated that McGee could not fur
nish coal .t a profit at the figure he
had quoted, and that he would save
himself from loss by short weighing
the deliveries. In view of these insin
uations Sealer of Weights and Meas
ures Kelly was ordered - to check up
the weight of various loads. This of
ficial frequently dropped in last year
at the coal yard after loads bad'heen
prepared for city delivery and each
time he found full weight. . Dr. Lyncli
also said the coal, furnished by Mr.
McGee . was up to the standard in
every respect.
The committee of the school board
and Dr. Lynch discussed whether or
not . coal might not be obtained
cheaper by buying direct at the mine
and having it brought to Bridgeport
in barges of 8,000 ton lots to be un
loaded at the city dock.
Commissioners Goddard, Hurley
and Schwerdtle said it was imperative
that proper prices be , obtained for
everything used in the school depart
ment in order that the board might
keep within its appropriation.
The committee could not agree as to
how much coal would be required for
the new schools now that the new-

about 9,000 tons would be required for
the schools. Commissioner Hurley es
timated at least 7,000 tons and Com
missioner Schwerdtle 6,000 tons. ComS
missioner Goddard said that last year
the board spent $3,800 for writing pa
per for use in the schools but this year
the bil for paper would" be nearly
$7,000. v
A meeting of the -board of contract

source o the fire that broke out there
Saturday. i
fThomas Edwards, who With Thomas
A. Kirkham, president of ,the Berk

conducting the mine, said today: "We

The -wooden structures of the mine

ALIENISTS WILL
BE BIG FACTORS
IN WAITE TRIAL
Insanity Likely To Be De
fense of Dentist Held For
- Murder.
EACH SIDE CALLS
MEDICAL EXPERTS
Throng Attends Opening
. Session of Case In
New York.
New York, May 22 Four alienists
headed the throng of witnesses gath
ered in the criminal branch of the su
preme court today for the trial of Dr.
Arthur Warren Waite, charged with
murder, first degree, in the poisoning
of riis father-in-law, John E. Peck,
a wealthy manufacturer of Grand
Rapids, Mich. Since he has confessed
the deed, the 'prosecution believes that
the defense will rely upon a plea of
insanity.
To combat this testimony the state
has engaged three medical experts
and summoned witnesses who knew
the defendant at different periods of
his career. The defense has summon
ed one alienist.
One of the interesting1 figures at the
trial, next to he prisoner himself,
will be his wife, Mrs. Clara Peck
Waite, and Mrs. Margaret . Horton,
with whom Waite occupied at times a
"studio" at an uptown hotel. Alto
gether the state has subpoenaed 115
witnesses. f
The second week in . January, Mrs.
Peck became ill and on Jan. 30 shft.
died in the Waite apartment. At
Waite's suggestion her body wa
takento Detroit and cremated. Be
cause of this fact the prosecution
sought an indictment against the son-in-law
only in connection with the
death of Mr. Peck -which took place
March 12. ' .
Waite, - clean-shaven and Tieatly
dressed, was brought- Into the court
room a few minutes after the opening.
The prisoner occupied a seat beside
his two -attorneys, Walter R. Deuel
and Joseph F. Crater. The wife of
the accused was not in court.
Long before court convened a crowd
gathered about the criminal courts
building, but owing to an extra panel
of talesmen and the large number of
witnesses, few persons not - connected
with the case were admitted to the
courtroom. - Indications were that it
probably would require the better part
of the day to select a Jury. - Robert
Neill, a mechanical engineer, the third
talesman examined, was the first ac
ceptatale to both prosecution and de
fense and he was" sworn in as the first
Juror.
Interrogating - the talesmen, . Mr,
Deuel laid stress .on the question as to
whether consideration would be given
to evidence calculated to show the
prisoner was "not well mentally" at
the time he administered germ cul
tures of deadly disease to Mr. Peck as
he has already confessed.
Assistant District Attorney George
N. Bothers conducted the case for the
state. "S. -
One hour after the trial started 12
talesmen had been interrogated, three
of whom were accepted , as Jurors.
Waite showed no emotion "during" the
proceedings. . '
The task of selecting a jury pro
gressed rapidly, neither side using
many challenges. Before the luncheon
recess the jury had been completed.

Mary Hopko, aged 31, of 209
Pine street was instantly killed
about noon today by the Bar
Harbor express at the Burr
Road crossing. Her husband,
AndrewT, tried t6 save her and
injuries he received in the at
tempt are expected to cost his
life.
jThe engineer of the train de
scribes the circumstances in.
sucfr a manner that suicide is
intimated. Investigation how
ever ,has failed to reveal tho
cause of the accident.
Mr. and Mrs. Hopko have been mar
ried only a short time. Their mar
riage license was obtained'- Nov. 21.
1914, but they were not married until
tiiuch later. '
It is known they were planning to
build a house and were in the West
End looking ovfer available property.
They started to cross the tracks at
Burr Road, the scene of many rail
road fatalities. According to the en
gineer of the Bar Harbor express,
which is due in Bridgeport about
11.30, the women was standing be
tween the rails on Track No. 4 when,
the train approached. He says the
woman was waving her arms, facing
the train. - He slowed the express,
which was proceeding at a fast rate,
and then he saw a, man try to pull
the woman from the tracks.'-
The man, who. proved to Y Mary's
husband, was ufl successful. The
train struck Mary and she was
knocked under the cow catcher. One
side of the engine struck Andrew Hop
ko and he too, went down. The
train passed a car lengtn before It
was stopped.
The train crew ran to the engine
and pulled the bodies from the tracks.
While there was no blood on the
woman, she was dead. Later it was
learned her skull was fractured, and
her chest was crushed.
Aridrew was alive. His right arm
was cut off close to "his shoulder and
his left leg was severed .above the
knee. Passengers, who piled from
the ears, gave first aid. One of them
fainted. '
A call was sent to the second pre

was soon on the scene, with Police
man Tobis. The dead body was taken
to the morgue of Cullinan & Mulling
while Hopko was rushed to St. Vin
cent's hospital. It is said there he has
little chance to live.
The engineer "reported the occur
