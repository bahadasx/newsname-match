May Change Hia Plea
Walte* formal plea was "Net
guilty," but he may change It todav
The state will attempt to prove
that tha slender, nattily attired
smiling youth who sit* quietly be
fore a long tabl* In this drab and
silent court room, deliberately
wooed and married Clara Peck with
the preconceived Intention of mur
dering her. her father and mother
and any other persona It might be
necessary to murder In order tha'
he might get possession of the Pack
millions.
The state will introduce evidence
to prove that Walte, married to
Clara Peck, and having Mr*. ICIIaa
beih Morton as his studio compan
lon. In a big New York hotel, ar
tually did get Mr. and Mrs I'e< k to
New York on a visit and murder
them by poisoning them w|ih
arsenic.
Planned Wife's Murder
w It will also charge that he got his
wife to will her emate to him, and
was planning her murder as the
third of the series In his alleged
scheme to get the Peck millions
With his wife turned against him
and prosecuting her suit for di
vorce. and Margaret Hor'on, hi*
atudlo companion, fresh from the
triumphs of a vaudeville engage

licity she gained from her a«M»'ia
tlon with him. Walte face* his fight
against the electric fhalr without
the support either of the woman he
married or the woman he aquan
dered his money on.
The pretty Mm Morton, with
whom Walte ahared a atudlo tn the
fashionable Plaza. where ahe says
they atudled dramatic art and lan
guages. will be an Important link
In the chain of evidence.
She will be atkad to tell if

He said: "I'll bet I can."
They took him up. That's how the wager came
about.
Still that doesn't tell you much, does it?

and hi* wife, with the murder.
They were tried, but not con

The mystery continufd as deep
as ever until today, when Former
