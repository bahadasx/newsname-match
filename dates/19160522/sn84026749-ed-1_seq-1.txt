bands of Mexican bandits arc reported
moving north In the wake of the with
drawing American troops, committing
depredations and spreading' terror In
the villages.
The report was brought to thi Co

It is believed hero that the Mexicans
who fired on thirteen troopers of the
Seventh Cavalry, wounding one, were
members of one of these bands.
These bandits are moving In bands
of from fifty to seventy, and have
kept far enough behind the retiring
Americans to avoid a clash.
Many inhabitants of the region
around San Antonio, Mexico, are flee

can troops.
General Pershing has sent back
cavalry detachments to attack and
disperse these bands.
Btorles that the American troops
are withdrawing oecause villa nas
recovered and Is recruiting an army
to fight the American troops have
been circulated among the Mexican
i peons and are believed responsible
for the new outbreak of banditry.
Unofficial reports of the attack on

In today's utterances of Premier
Briand of France, officials here see
nmple Justification for the refusal of
President Wilson at this time to renew
formally his offer of mediation to tho
powers at war.
The statement of the French premier
Is regarded not only as the latest
answer of the allies to Germany's In
direct overtures for peace, but as a
plain Intimation to well-meaning neu
trals to keep hands off.
This Interpretation Is amply backed
up by views expressed today In tho
local chancellories of the entento
rowers.
Though undoubtedly partisan, these
view, appear to reflect a unanimous
belief on the part of the. allied gov
ernments lhat the tide of the war
has rhnnged, and that Germany la
righting on her last legs.
For that reason tt Is believed In
these quarters that If King Alfonso
of Spain as Madrid reports Indicate,
Is rually preparing to offer his serv
ices us peacemaker his overtures nro
rertuln to receive a pollto but definite
rejection.
Can't Consider Parley.
Believing that the fate of the war is
now in their hands It would be absurd
for the Entente powers, the diplomatic
representatives of these powers observe
to entertain suggestions for peace while
German armies are still on French and
Belgian soil, and while Germany and
her Allies arc In complete possession
or Serbia.
"Only a decided victory!" as express
ed by Briand is interpreted In the light
of the address made n Pctrograd last
Friday by Rene Vlvlanl, the French
mlnliter of Justice, who declared that
In the name of Franco and her allies
he could promise that there would De
thought of peace until Germany had
been brougnt to ner Knees.
