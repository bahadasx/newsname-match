Park Ordinance
Thursday night at a special meet
ing an ordinance was passed attempt
ing to turn the jurisdiction of Lithia
park entirely over to the park com
mission. Under it no music, or pub
He spocch, or concession, or parade,
or pageant; no camping, or going to
tfeep on a bench, or picnic party, or
anything or anybody else can use
Lithia Park without a written permit
from the park commission.
The ordinance was passed by the
affirmative votes of Ashcraft, Banta
and Root. Nlninger was not present.
Lamb and Cornelius voted against it.
The mayor has not yet signed the or
dinance. Any time up to 6 o'clock
tomorrow night he may either sign
or veto It. If ho neither signs nor
vetoes It by that time it takes effect
by limitation.
The ordinance Is a good one for
regulation of the park- In many re
spects some think It is too drastic.
However, the writer does not hold
that view.
The only Issue was whether the
council should recognize the jurisdic
tion of the park commission or the
springs water commission In Lithia
Park. There has been consid
erable personal feeling between
the three council members who
passed the ordinance and the springs
water commission, because the
springs commission would not al
low these counc'.lmen to "butt into"
the springs project. The springs com
mission feels that personal spite In
spired these members more than the
good of the resort project in voting
to change the park jurisdiction be
fore the springs commission had fin
ished Us work.
Mr. Cornelius and Mr. Lamb were
favorable to the general provisions
of the ordinance, but were not ready
to slap the springs commission In the
face by attempting arbitrarily to
change the jurisdiction in Lithia
Park until the springs commission
had finished its work there and made
Its final report. Mr. Cornelius ofr
fered the following amendment to the
ordinance which raised the issue
squarely on the question of Jurisdic
tion: "'Provided, however, that the Juris
diction and powers herein granted to
the park commission shall be given
the springs water commission within
the limits of that district known as
Lithia Park, and the said springs wa
ter commission shall do and perform
within said limits all things herein
required to be performed or exercised
by the park commission until the said
springs water commission shall have
completed the physical springs plant
and filed Its final report as required
by charter amendments now In
force."
This amendment was promptly
voted down by Root, Ashcraft and
Banta, showing conclusively their de
, termination to knife the springs
water commission.
1 Just what action wtll be taken by
the springs, water commission will
not bo determined until after the
mayor acts on the ordinance. Attor
neys have alvlscd that the charter
amendments passed last year by the
people give the springs commission
absolute Jurisdiction in Lithia Park
until the springs money is spent and
a final report provided for In the
charter Is formaMy filed. They hold
that the charter amendment put
everything connected with the springs
.enterprise absolutely in the hands of
the springs water commission, until
the funds voted at the time were
spent, the project finished and the
springs water commission formally
turned the enterprise back to the city.
After that the Jurisdiction will rest
entirely in the hands of the park com
mission and city council. Therefore,
it is doubtful whether the ordinance
will have the least legal effect until
the enterprise is so formally turned
over to the city.
It is entirely beyond the legal pow
er of the city council to change this
jurisdiction. It has been the inten
tion of the springs commission to call
another election as soon as the
project was completed and letjthe
people say whether the springs .com.
mission or the park commission shall
handle the resort features of the., en
terprise. Thls.j.Messra.Bapta, ,ftpot

May Ask Governor
To Establish Patrol
Medford Sun: It is probable that
Governor Withycombe will be asked
to establish a state patrol of the Pa
cific Highway to stop bringing whis
key and beer into this state. The
coming summer will see the influx of
citizens from Hornbrook mixing gaso
line and booze on the top of the Siski
yous, with the result of reckless driv
ing, endangering the lives of them
selves and everybody else, and it Is
this feature that the authorities are
anxious to stop. It has been report
ed that extra tanks have been fitted
on several autos for the express pur
pose of carrying booze from Horn
brook. Already there have been sev
eral reports of reckless driving on
the Pacific Highway caused by booze.

Northern California
Fifteen auto loads of enthusiastic
boosters for Ashland's Springs Dedi
cation Celebration and Round-up mo
tored over through northern Califor
nia Sunday, decked out with banners
and round, up hats, and did some very
effective advertising for Ashland's big
July event. The destination of most
of the crowd was Montague, where a
circus was showing. The Ashland del
egation were given a pJace in the pa
rade. The return trip was made
through Yreka and over the new
highway. The roads are reported
good and everyone had a rlproarlngly
good time. The entire population
will be over from northern California,
according to those who went over Sat
urday. Over three thousand handbills
were distributed and the Ashland
crowd made almost as big a splash as
the circus:
Among those who made the trip
were Messrs. and Mesdames Adams,
Bates, Bergner, Grieve, Sinclair, Nis
bet, Nell, Barnthouse, Ray Sayles, Bill
Coates, Ivan Dennis, Crowson, and
Messrs. Ed Thornton, John Enders,
Wilfred Carr, Howard Barrett, and
enough more whose names werajnot

Dedication Parades
The committee on parades for the
Springs Dedication Colebration had
their second meeting last Saturday
and their organization is being per
fected. The ladies who have this part
of the program of entertainment In
charge have entered into their work
with a determination for success, and
with this spirit there Ib no question
but what Ashland will have the best
parades during this celebration that
have ever before passed along the
streets of Ashland.
There will bo three parades, one on
each morning of tho celebration. On
the 4th there will be an industrial
and patriotic parade, on the 6th doc
orated automobile, and on the 6th
a comic under the supervision of
"King Sulphur."
The Industrial and patriotic parade
wilft consist of the various marching
organizations, horseback riders,
floats, the participants of the Round
up, etc. The decorated automobile
parade has good prospects of being
most successful for the reason that
so many of our residents have autos
now, and several! have1 already signi
fied their intention to enter this pa
rade. On the last day of the celebra
tion there will be the parade which
will be most entertaining to the chil
dren, and the features which are be
ing worked out along the comic line
will aho be most interesting to the
grownups.
The following have been appointed
by Mrs. L. Hilty, who is chairman of
the general committee, to take charge
of the various divisions of the three
parades: Mrs. Charles Gillette, chair
man of the industrial and patriotic
parade; Mrs. F. B. Tracy win be
chairman of the decorated automobile
parade, and Mrs. E. H. Bush is chair
man of the comic parade of "King
Sulphur." The full membership of
all of the sub-cbmmlttees will be an
nounced later. It 'will be necessary
for the complete success of the pa
rades that the ladles have the co
operation of every citizen In Ashland,
and (f any one who Is willing to enter
a flocr decorate an automobile It
would be a great help to the various
committees if you wijl let them know
as soon as possible of your intention.
Will Prevent
Jitney Holdups
Drivers of jitneys wiH not be al
lowed to "hold up" their passengers
for exorbitant sums during the great
Ashland celebration. The city council
at Thursday's session passed an ordi
nance which provides for a license fee
of $3 for all jitneys operating In the
city from July 3 to 8 Inclusive and
establishes a maximum charge of 10
cents for any trip within the city.
The haul to the "round-up grounds,
which is Just outside the city, will
thus be made at a cost of 10 cents to
the passenger. The police will see to
it that the ordinance is not violated.
Ashland intends to give her guests a
square deal and the best time of their
Hives during the Dedication cel'ebra
yon. Will Widen
Park Avenue
At the adjourned session of the city
council Thursday evening Councilman
Banta presented a plan for the widen
ing and straightening of Park avenue,
which was adopted by tho council.
The plan will give a fifty-foot drive
way. The property line on the west
wiK be moved back several feet, tho
new line bisecting the Kinney and
Billings barns and coming into tho
present line at the corner of the
creamery. Some land will be taken
from the Chautauqua Park property
on the other side In order to straight
en the street.

May Robson
Makes Big Hit
"The Making Over of Mrs. Matt"
was the best thing of its kind ever
staged In Ashland. May Robson
could hardly havo acted her part bet
ter. The whole company was right
there for their honors also.
In this work James Forbes has cre
ated some real human beings such as
ono meets in everyday life, and if the
wit of Mrs. Matt, the nouveau riches,
who, regardless of her husband's
means and social ambitions, simply
cannot metamorphose, is perhnps
more ready and more scintillating
than one moets with often, it never
theless is In no way strained or stilt
ed, and it gurgles and bubbles and
bursts from the lips of this lovable
character, as portrayed by Miss Rob
son, according as the situation and
the spirit moves.
The play is full of clever lines,
worked into a plot sufficient for their
purpose, and while the star is ever
the star, with Miss Robson's sympa
thetic interpretation emphasizing the
fact, there Is enough and to spare
for a number of other characters,
whose excellent Individual and en

will then be submitted to the voterj
of tho district for their approval or
disapproval.
Tho sincere and hardworking- en
thusiasts who are behind the district
project are greatly encouraged ovor
the manner in which tho landowners
have thrown themselves Into the p'au
and the commencement of work upon
a huge irrigation system which will
stableizo tho fruit crop, treble tho
small crops and lend a great impetus
I to the dairy industry, meaning great
er prosperity for tho farmors and for
the cities at which they trade. The
' establishment of tho proposed LIbby,
McXcN & LIbby vegetable cannery
seems most certain as a result of this
election.

Another Band
Dance Friday
Another band dance Is to be given!
next Friday in the Natatorlum. Thera
are now twenty-five pieces in the
band and they have been practicing;
regularly ever since the first dance.
The first dance was admitted by most
people to bo the best thing of its kind!
ever pulled off in Ashland. With aU
this practice they should, and can,
serve up the best dance music ever
heard here. With the proceeds of tho
first dance uniforms were to be
bought. It was decided to buy coats
and caps only and let the' members
buy their own trousers! The pro
ceeds of this dance are to be divided
among the members of the band for
them to buy their trousers with. As
Frank Jordan aptly put It, "A band
J dance for pants." The tickets are to
I be only 75 cents this time, and every
one, should come out and dance. If
you cannot dance, come out anyway
and listen to the music. However
even if you cannot dance, we will not
guarantee that you will not be danc
ing before the evening is over, be
cause well, you know music hath,
charms.
