Two Thousand Attended Mass
Meeting: at Auditorium.
The jitney ordinance as amended
and passed by the city commissioners
today is nearing a point where To
pekans may be benefited by addi
tional service to and from down town.
The city officials, making: many
changes in the original ordinance
after the instigation on the part of the
State Journal, passed a measure that
in many ways is fair to the drivers
of jitneys. It gives them Kansas ave
nue, streets on the east side and all
streets on the west side with the ex
ception of streets used by the street
railway.
In this .way Topekans have better
and more accessible service on the i
territory not covered by street .cars.
Now if the commissioners will not in
sist upon a. prohibitive license fee, the
new rule will be of adantage to all
persons who depend upon the carriers
fi'.r their trips to and from the down
town districts. The State Journal asks
absolute fairness in all regulation to
the street railway as well as the jit
neys. By a three to two vote the ordin
ance, providing that jitneys cannot run
on streets used by street cars, except as
amended, was passed by the city com
missioners today. Commissioners
Tandy and Porter, with Mayor House
voted for the ordinance. Commission
ers Wasson and Newland voted against
it.
Amended for Jitneys.
The ordinance which the commis
sion passed this morning was altered
in several points and was not the
samf1 as vxs read Saturday, accord
ins to the commissioners.
'rhe jitneys were given the privilege
to operate on Kansas avenue, on, all
streets east of the avenue and on all
streets west of the avenue, except
th-se used by the street railway com
pany urder the present license fee.
I'.ut i" the jitneys want to operate on
streets west of the avenue on which
there are street car tracks they will
be taxed the $300 graduated fee as
proposed in the ordinance read Satur
day. The Ijccnse Fee.
According to the new ordinance
which will take effect June 19 all
Jitney drivers who wish to operate un
der the new ordinance must pay an
annual tax as follows: For all cars
not exceeding five passengers $300 per
annum; from five to eight passenger
cars $350; and for those cars carry
ing eight or more passengers $400.
This applies if they wish to operate
on any street in the city.
The caucus held in the mayor's of
fice did not show signs of breaking up
till long after the noon hour when sud
denly the jitney committee, who had
been laboring with the commissioners
for over three hours, appeared in the
outer office of the mayor and an
nounced that they were unable to
agree.
Immediately after this the mayor
and commissioners appeared and an
nounced that the ordinance would be
passed as introduced at their meeting ! time p,ns were' formulated for con
Saturday. j sideratinn of the new ordinance.
The commission room was already ' It is stated that there will be no
filled with jitney men and Topeka tax
payers who were friendly to them, as
well as a number of street railway of
ficials, who were there to watch the
proceeding, when the mayor entered
and called the meeting to order.
"As there are quite a number of
people here who have been here for
some time the lirst thing to be con
sidered will be the jitney ordinance,"
announced the mayor.
Jct Busy Anions Friends.
Attorney Green representing the jit-
ney men had just finished a short
speech to the crowd, tn which he told
the men that petitions for the referen- j
dum would be circulated at once and j
for them to get busy among their
friends with the petitions.
J. O. Stevic advised the men "to
stand together. Get out and work and
within 36 days the question would be
decided one way or ihe other."
The city clerk was instructed by the
mayor to read the ordinance section
by section, which was done, and the
commissioners voted on each section
as read and the final, and test vote did
not come until after all of the sections
had been read.
In Effect in ; 0 Days. .
After the passage of the ordinance
the mayor advised those present that
the ordinance would be held up for a
reasonable length of time in order
that all those interested may meet
with the commissioners and thresh the
matter out. section by section. Attor
ney Green asked on behalf of the jit
ney men that 30 days' time be allowed
before publication and the enforce
ment of the ordinance. Commissioner
Wasson moved that this request be
granted and Commissioner Tandy of-,
(.rH a substitute to the effect that
June 3 be the limit of time set. When
the matter was voiea on iuuj ouu
stitute motion was lost and the Was
son motion was carried with Tandy
voting no, while Wasson. Porter and
Newland voted in favor of the longer
'"as the reading of the ordinance pro
gressed Commissioner Tandy offered
a resolution to the effect that all
streets named in the ordinance be
struck qut and that as a substitute, all
streets east or me ra m.c ------on
street be included, as affecting the
jitney with reference to this part of
the city " Attorney Green offered and
read a protest of citizens living in this
district against the proposed action
of the commissioners and in conjunc
tion with this protest presented a
huge mass of petitions carrying over
S 000 names of citizens who were
against the efTorts to drive the jitney
from the streets. now oecupi' d by the
street car company.
The petitions were receivd and or
dered filed, but permission was given
the jitney men to retain possession of
them until the commissioners called
for them.
Contract Broken?
When the section referring to the
time limit of the licenses was read
Attornev Green called the attention of
the commissioners to the fact that "the
city had already made a contract with
the jitney men and now they proposed
to break it." The real reason which
lay behind this protest, it was learned
afterwards, was that it wassimply lay
ing the foundation for future legal
action.
.-When -the time came fof-the reet
vote, those in the rear of the hall
mounted chairs in order that they
might obtain a full and clear view of
all that was going on.
Porter Voted "Yes."
Intense silence prevailed as the
clerk began to call the roll. The first
name called was that of Newland,
who voted "no" in a loud voice so
that there was no misunderstanding
on the stand he was taking. Tandy
came next and he voted "yes." Por
ter, on whom the laboring class had
placed hope, voted against the jitDey
men by voting "yes." Wasson voted
"no."
Immediately after the vote was an
nounced a Mrs. Avery asked permis
sion to say a word, which the mayor
readily granted, and raised a rousing
cheer and caused a big laugh by
! stating "Mr. Mayor and commission
i ers. I wiph to call the attention of
the commissioners that they have
omitted to legislate the jitney off all
of the paved alleys in the city of To
peka. They must have forgotten this."
Jitney Men Are Mad.
To say that the jitney men are dis
appointed at the action of the commis
sion is expressing it mildly for, as sev
eral of them stated on the steps of the
city hall, "the election next year be
gins from this moment and organized
labor will fight this matter to a
finish."
That organized labor intends to call
on the city commissioners to begin an
immediate investigation of the various
statements which the street car com
pany and the Topeka Edison company
have offered the city in which they
show their condition with reference to
their tax. is the statement of many of
the men who attended the city hall
today.
"If they pay such a huge lump of
the city's taxes we want to know it and
will ask the commissioners to get busy
and have their books audited to see
Just how much back tax they really
owe." was the statement of S. K. Mc-
Grew.
Referendum Petitions.
In any event the action of the city
commissioners today throws the ques
tion wide open and all of the citizens
will have an opportunity to express
their opinion at a coming election
which, it is stated, will be held just as
soon as the- referendum petitions can
be obtained and the .publication of the
election take place, after June 19.
The meeting was orderly through
out, there being no disturbance of any
kind by any of the men to mar the
proceedings. They were deadly se
rious. Meeting This Afternoon.
A meeting was held in Industrial
Council hall at 3 o'clock this after-
petitions for the referendum until after
the publication of the - ordinance,
which will mal.o it effective, and as
this will not take place until after
June 19. there will be no agitation
for the submission of the question at
this time.
In the meantime a committee from
the Jitney men's union will be organ
ized and will meet with the city com
missioners to iron out the various
kinks in the ordinance as passed.

If TEDDY
"Unnecessary to Discuss Any
One Else," Justice Declares.
Hughes Still Refuses to Become
Open Candidate.
CURTIS MAKES A STATEMENT
Kansas Senator Says It Is Any
Man's Race Still.
He Will Support WhoeTer Is
Nominated by G. O. P. ,
Washington, May 22. The first
statement by Associate Justice Charles
F Hughes, of the United States su
preme court, on the Republican nomi
r.ation for president has been obtained.
He was quoted by a leader in the Re
publican party favorable to the pre
convention campaign for his nomina
tion. Justice Hughes said:
"In my opinion Roosevelt is going
to be nominated, so it makes it un
necessary to discuss any one else at
alL"
Great pressure has been brought to
bear upon Justice Hughes to-autoonze
the car ipaign in hir behalf. - That was
his reply.
Justice Hughes's -statement was in
terpreted by his supporters to mean
that he has made up his mind ha will
not connive at getting the nomination,
so that if he should be named, he may
be able to say that while on the ru
preme bench he never by word Or deed
sought the honor.
His friends declare he will not ha
disappointed if he is not nominated,
that he is perfectly sincere and con
tent to remain on the bench. His
closest friends, those most anxious
to know his real attitude toward the
nomination, assert that they are
wholly without guidance or suggestion
from him.
Refuse It After Fight.
They believe, however, that Justice
Hughes will be controlled by the pres
ence or lack of unanimity of spirit at
the Chicago convention. They believe
also he would refuse the nomination
if it should come to him after a bitter
fight.
Republican senators declare there is
no question that Colonel Roosevelt
would support Justice Hughes if the
latter were nominated. They say
Colonel Roosevelt's controlling desire
ie the defeat of the Democratic ad
ministration and that he ie thoroughly
stirred up.
"Whatever the future may have In
store," one of the former president's
warmest friends said, "for the present
Colonel Roosevelt will support the Re
publican party. He may reserve the
right, however, to reorganize the Pro
gressive party."
Prominent Republican leaders in
congress have been informed that
Colonel Roosevelt considers the pLat
form to be adopted at Chicago as at
even more importance to the future
of the party than the candidate to be
named. No matter who the candidate
may be he has made it known, they
said, that unlees the platform is
strongly American he will fight the
ticket.
These views from Colonel RooerH
were brought to Washington by a Re
publican of national prominence who
is a member of the "old guard."
No Accident Anticipated.
It is the belief of Republican led
ers that no accident can happen at
Chicago. The delegates are going
there after a great deal of reflection
and with the determination t" nomi
nate the man who will win the fight.
They are primed to pick a winner. All
serious minded Republicans, it was
said, realize that it would be foolish
to decline to nominate either Roose
velt or Hughes. the sentiment for
whom in their opinion, is manifest. 11
was said further that it makes no dif
ference how the delegates are nom
inally lined up, they will name either
Roosevelt or Hughes.
Senator Curtis of Kanxas said:
