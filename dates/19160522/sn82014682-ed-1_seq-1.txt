Baby Boy Hurt By Dray Re
moved From Hospital and
Dies Later
Htnry Correia, 3 years old, died at
the Queen's Hospital about 2 o'clock
this afternoon. The child was nm
over at 10:20 this morning near his
home by a dray driven by a Japau-(
ese, x. wamura, tne . owner 01 me
dray, according to the police informa
tion, being a Japanese contractor, K.
Namura.
Between 10:30 and the time of the
little fellow's death the badly injured
child had figured in a curious and
pathetic series of incidents. He. bad
been taken from the scene of the ac
cident to the city emergency hospital,
from there to. the Kauikeolanl Chil
dren's Hospital and from there to his
home. The frantic mother went to
parrying the dying baby away.
The humane officer was notified of
tha shiM'a nlttht onH nhrmt 1-2(1 I
relative of the mother took the suf
fering youngster to the Queen's Hos
pital. Now the . body has been re
moved by the coroner to the govern
ment morgue,-
The Japanese driver was arrested
arm charged with heedless driving.
He is out on bail in the sum of $250.
Deputy Sheriff Asch said this after-:
noon that the evidence so far obtain
ed tends to show that the Japanese
was not at fault for the fatal accident
Stories of witnesses are disconnected
and in some cases contradictory.
With his left lung crushed,: face
bruised and little body hurt inter
nally Henry Correia lay for some time
in a hot little room on Vineyard
street, just off Liliha street, fighting
with death.
According to an eye witness, W. Sue
mori of the Singer Sewing Machine
Co., Henry caught on a brake rod of
the dray, fell off and was run over
before the driver could stop. Discon
nected stories of other witnesses do
not bear out this statement, however.
Some aver that the little fellow was
run oer by the Japanese, who tried
to hurry away after the accident, but
was stopped by the crowd which con
gregated. .
The boy's mother is named Minnie
Bartels. She has been divorced from
her husband, Correia, say the neigh
bors. Between sobs this afternoon
she told the Star-Bulletin that she had
left the three-year-old son in the
neighbors care but that they had ne
glected him and allowed him to run
in the street
The accident, was reported prompt
ly to the police and the little boy tak
en to, the emergency hospital, where
he was treated by Police Surgeon K.
G. Ayer. Then he was sent to the ;
Kauikeolanl Children's hospital where
he was atttended by Dr. A. G. Hodg
