Rome, May 22, via Paris. 4:20 p
m. Austrian artillery of all sizes and
all ranges with the monster 305 .milli
meter guns predominating, has trans
. formed the battle front between tho
Adige and Brenta rivers Into an in-
ferno.
Notwithstanding the snow capped
. ' mountain barriers the Austrian infan-
If try Is being launched in waves which
I military observers say, break aaglnst
the formidable resistance of the Ital
ians. The Italian troops have now formed
their lines of offense and are holding
firmly all the passes and peaks from
which Italian officers say the forward
movement of the Austrians lias not
only been successfully arrested but
the Austrians have been dislodged
from several strategic positions tak
en in the -first rush of the offensive.
I There are Indications to confirm the
statement that tho design of the pres
r ent strenuous campaign of the Aus
ft trlans on the Trentlno front is to pre-
Ivent Italy from participating with her
troops in the struggle on the French
front and also to parnlyze any action
aiming at the joining of the Avlona
and Salonlki forces for a simultaneous
effort.

More than 3000 Italians were cap
tured on Saturday by the Austrians

TROOPS TAKEN
FROM ALBANIA
t
Austrians Unable to Bring Up
Supplies, Withdraw Fifty
Thousand Men, Leaving
Small Detachments.
Paris, May 22, 5 "15 a, m. A neu
tral diplomat who has Just returned
from Albania, Is quoted In a dispatch
to the Matin from Athens as saying
that the Austrians have withdrawn
50,000 troops from Albania in the last
three weeks. According to this dip
lomat the Austrians have left only
small detachments to guard the towns
they havo occupied, leaving a garri
son of 300 at Fiera and COO at Berat.
The remainder of the troops left In tho
country are concentrated at Durazzo.
The abandonment of the Albanian
front Is said to be due to tho Impos
sibility of bringing up supplies.
The statement that the Austrians
aro withdrawing their main forces
from Albania apparently conflicts with
recent dispatches from Athens and
Paris which stated that the Teutons
were about to launch an attack In
force against Avlona, the only town
that remains In the possession of tho
Italians. On May 19 the Austrians
were reported to have assembled a
fleet of 150 transports' at Flume to
transport troops and supplies to Dur-azzo.

Germans Hurl 60,000 Men,
Backed by Sixty Batteries of
All Calibre Guns at the
Coveted Summit.
Paris, May 22. 5:45 a. m The bat
tle of Verdun, the longest and most
bitterly fought individual struggle of
the war, enters on Its fourth month
today. The Germans are hammering
at Dead Man's Hill, where tho most
furious and bloody fighting of the
three months' conflict has taken
place. Clinging desperately to the
trenches that they have wrested from
the French on the lower slopes of the
hill, the Teutons have hurled 60,000
men, backed by sixty batteries of
guns of all calibres, forward along a
seven-mile front from Avocourt wood
to te Meuse In a desperate effort to
seize the coveted summit.
The Germans have succeeded in
gaining a footing in the French first
line at a cost of severe losses, but
judgiug from the experience of the
past it will not be a difficult task
for the French to dislodge them be
fore they are able to follow up their
advantage.
Key to Whole System.
That the Germans must continue
their tremendous onslaught on Dead
Man's hill or abandon the idea of tak

GENERAL CARRAIA DISPATCHES I
NEW NOTE TO WASHINGTON I
Special Agent Rodgers Urlable to Learn Reason for
New CommunicationLanghorne and Sibley H
Return to Border Sixth Cavalry to Aid in H
Patrol at Boquillas and Reinforce Colonel H
Sibley Clash Between Pershing's Rear H
Guard and Bandits Reported. H
Washington. May 22. The state de
partment has been advised that a new
note from General Carranza on the
border situation probably will reach
Washington today or tomorrow. Spe
cial Agent Rodgers at Mexico City
has been unable to report whqt has
called for the new communication.
Mr. Rodgers lias advised the state
department that Carranza officials in
Mexico City feel the border situation
is less critical. Some officials believe
it possible that the new note deals
with the Glenn Springs raid. Repre
sentations were made by the state
department at that tirrte which have
not been answered.
It is believed probable the new
American expedition sent over the line
after the raid may bo the cause of the
coming note.
Border reports insist that Colonel
Sibley commanding the new expedi
tion, is already withdrawing his for
ces to the American side, but Secre
tary Baker reiterated today that Gen
oral Funston had not so advised the
war department.
Anxiety For Major Langhorne.
San Antonio, Tex , May 22. Some
anxiety as to the reported situation
of the American trops south of Bo
quillas was displayed today at Gen
eral Funston's headquarters. No offi
cial reports however, indicated hos
tile movements of any- band near Col
onel Sibley's two troops of the Four
teenth cavalry had been received.
When last accounted for Major
Langhorne and his two troops of the
Eighth cavalry were moving north
ward to join Colonel Sibley. If It de
velops that the little punitive column
Is in danger, it Is probable a force of
the Sixth cavalry which has Just ar
rived in the Big Bend district will be
used as a renforcemenL
Officers at department headquarters
were inclined to regard the sniping to
which the rear guard of General Per
shing's troops had been subjected as
the action of a reduced force of VII
listas and relatively unimportant.
Sixth Cavalry to Reinforce Sibley.
Marathon, Tex., May 22. Two
troops of the Sixth cavalry withdrawn
last week from General Pershing's for
Ices, detrained here early today pre
paratory to marching to Boquillas,
where they will be In a position to
, patrol the border and reinforce Col
onel Sibley and Major Langhorne If
necessary. .
A report reached here today that
Mexican snipers fired on two Ameri
can soldiers bathing in the Rio Grande
near Deemer's Ford Friday, but failed
to hit them.

BANDITS LOOT
AMERICAN MINES
Offices, Houses and Store
houses Pillaged and Booty
Carried to Interior Points.
El Paso, Tex., May 22. American
and other foreign-owned mining pro
perties at Cuatro Clenegas were lootr
ed by bandits on May 16, acordlng to
reliable information received hore to
day. The looters previously had attacked
Sierra Mojada and among them were
a number of tho bandits who raided
Glenn Springs and Boquillas, Tex. Af
ter pillaging the offices, houses and
storehouses, they carried their booty
to the country between Cuatro Clene
gas and San Pedro, where they went
into hiding.
According to the samo Information
the country between Cuatro Clenegas,
which Is the birthplace and home dis
trict of General Carranza, Sierra Mo
jada and San Pedro contains innumer
able bandits. Up to a week ago these
had not felt the pressure of General
Trevlno's troop movements.
Advices received here say nothing
regarding the presence of Yaqul In
dians at Cuatro Clonegas, as reported
In dispatches.
WILSON TO SIGN
THE ARMY BILL
Washington, May 22. President
Wilson today began consideration of
the army re-organization bill passed
by congress last week. He expects to
sign it within a few days. Ho (lis

i - -
man Hay and Chamberlain of the XH
house and senate military committees. F
Representative Hay told the presl- t
dent the army appropriation bill would
be ready for the house later this week. H
It will carry approximately $150,000,- H
000, an increase of $50,000,000 over J
last year's bill. wmm
The president told Senator Cham- H
berlaln today that generally he
thought the army re-organlzatlon bill
was satisfactory. Senator Chamber- H
lain said that apparently the National mm
Guard, called Into service along tho
Mexican border, was not meeting ex- WM
pectationB and it was possible that H
congress would still find it advisable H
to enact a federal volunteer bill.

der Last Year's Report. H
Topeka, Kas., May 22. A prospec- H
tive yield of 108,000,000 bushels of H
winter wheat in Kansas this year was H
forecast in a report covering condl- 11
tions up to May 17, issued today by H
J. C. Mohier, secretary of the state H
board of agriculture. Compared with H
a similar report issued at thiB timo fH
last year, a depreciation of 28,000,000 HH
bushels is shown.
Today's report says: !H
"The loss is mainly In the so-called
'wheat belt' of the central third of the H
state, because of Hessian fly and dry fl
weather, and In some of the western jH
counties, through lack of sufficient H
moisture. In the eastern part, the H
prospect has been pretty well main- H
tained. The green bug caused con- H
siderable damage In several south- H
central counties." H
"County reporters suggest that only JH
about SO per cent of the area that r
will be devoted to corn is planted and H
that much of the planted corn has not fil
yet made, its appearance through tho H
ground. It has been generally too H
cool for corn.'' tH
