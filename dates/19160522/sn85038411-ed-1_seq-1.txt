evident to-day that the big leaders of

trying to stave off bitter debate on
the floor of the convention here over
the alleged hetrodoxy of the New

ter smothered without any discussion
on the part of the assembly in open
session.

tures, J. KOSB Stevenson, Princeton,

New York Presbytery controversy, en
gendered by the petition filed by the
Cincinnati Presbytery, supported by
others, because three students who
failed to profess some of the cardinal
principles of the Presbyterian church
had been ordained by the New York
Presbytery.
J.ivcly Arguments Expected
There are several compromise over
tures now before the committee. One
proposes that a committee be appoint
ed by the assembly to go to the New
York Presbytery and make a thor
ough investigation and then report
back.
Before the overtures reach the floor
it is predicted that the convention
will witness some lively arguments be
cause of (he distribution of hundreds
of pamphlets, written by the Rev.
John Fox, a member of the New York
Presbytery on the subject "Critical
Scholarship vs. the Bible," in which

that such pamphlets should l>e kept

Mutiny Charged Against
Members of Texas Militia
Washington, D. ('., Mav 22.—Court
martial confronts llti enlisted men of
the Texas National Guard for their re
fusal to respond to the call for service
on the Mexican border.
Under the Dick militia law, accord
ing to the terms of which the guards
men were called out, such court
martial is provided for refusal to re
spond. but it is discretionary with the
War Department whether the clause
shall be enforced or ignored.
While some of the officials of the
War Department believe that court
martial might be a good object lesson
it is hardly likely that Secretary Baker,
of the War Department, will give his
approval to such a course.
Now lit)sis for Attack
The chief effect of the failure of the
militia of Texas. Arizona and New
Mexico to meet the emergency along
the border will be to provide a new
basis for attack on the national guard
in Congress. The members of the Sen
ate who have been contending that the
United States cannot rely upon the
national guard as a nucleus for a vol
unteer army in time of war are now
preparing to say that experience along
the border supports their contention.
Advocates of the national guard,
however, point out that the govern
ment issued its call to the organ
izations which were in the poorest
shape to respond: that if the call I ad
gone forth to the militia In any of
the eastern Stataes there would have
been a different result.
General Funston IF said to be pre
paring to request more coast artillery
men. since after twelve days he has re
ceived no help from the "militia. »nd
since this delay has compelled him to
withdraw troops from Mexico to guard
the border.

j ry Morgenthau. who recently resigned
I as ambassador to Turkey, spoke before
| the Wise (.'enter Forum here yester
i day and told his listeners that the
i sale of Palestine after the war, so
that the Ottoman empire might secure
money, had been discussed by him. He
told of how he broached the matter to
the Turkish ministry and how eagerly
it was discussed.
"We even got down to figures." said
Mr. Morganthau. "They argued as to
whether it should be an international
State or a republic."
Mr. Morganthau said that as to
whether Russian and German Chris
tians would allow the Jews to possess
Palestine was thoroughly discussed.
"I told the ministry that if a harbor
was built at Jaffa, Jerusalem would
yearly attract 500,000 visitors who
would spend at least SIOO each. See
ing that there was a way for the Jews
to pay for Palestine the Ottoman gov
ernment wanted to make concess:ons
immediately and asked that the build
ing of a harbor and hotels be started,"
I he stated.
