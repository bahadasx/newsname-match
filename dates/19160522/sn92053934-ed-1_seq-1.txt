The text of the statement follows:
"South of Berry-Au-Bac French
forces exploded two mines with suc
cess at Hi il 1 OS.
"In the Champagne district a gas at
tack hy the Germans was without re
sult. This emission of gas was in the
zone between the road from Souain to
Somme-Py and the road from Sainte
Hilaire to Saint Souplet. No sooner
had the cloud of gas started than an
unexpected turn in the direction of the
wind drove it back upon the trenches
of the enemy.
"On the left bank of the river Meuse
infantry fighting continued last night.
In the wood of Avocourt our grena
diers secured some advantages and oc
cupied several block houses evacuated
by the enemy.
"In the region west of Dead Man's
Hill the fighting has been particularly
ferocious. Several tentative attacks
made by the enemy to further their
progress have been checked by our
curtains of fire and by the activity of
our machine guns. A vigorous attack
by our troops made it possible for us to
recapture a portion of the ground lost
during the night of May 20-21.
"On the right bank of the Meuse the
Germans have delivered repeated coun
ter attacks upon the positions at the
Haudremont quarries captured by the
French yesterday. Each of these ad
vance movements was checked by our
curtain of fire and cost the Germans
heavy looses. In the outskirts of the
village of Vaux a small operation ex
ecuted this morning put us in posses
sion of a German trench. As Esparges
several German mines have been ex
ploded but without causing damage to
the French position.
German Balloons Fired.
"In the region of Verdun French
aviators have attacked a number of
captive German balloons. Six of these
balloons were sent down on fire. In an
aerial engagement one of our pilots
brought down a German aeroplane. In
the vicinity of Esparges two other air
machines of the enemy, attacked by
French aeroplanes were brought to
earth, one henind the enemy lines at a
point near I.iancourt and the other be
hind our lines at Fontenoy.
"This morning aeroplanes of the ene
my threw down bombs on Dunkirk.
"On the r.:!its of May 20, 21 and 22,
several operations were conducted by
groups of French aviators. Shells
were successfully thrown upon the
railroad stations at Metz-Sablons, Avri

Chicago, May 22. Completion of a

the plan prevails it will forestall ef

The debenture bondholders brief
says in part:
"At the time of the hearing of the
petitioners' petition (the Krauthoffj
petition), it was known by all parties
that plans were being prepared for the
reorganization of the railway com-!
pany. I
"Since that time the plan of the re-1
organization has been approved by the I
debenture committee and by the Am
ster and Hayden-Stone committees and
the securities which it is proposed to
issue under that plan have been under

plates the issue of preferred stock for
the debenture bonds having the same
standing as preferred stock to be is
sued in return for the assessment on
the common stock except that the pre
ferred for the debentures will bear a
six per cent rate. The plan is so drawn
that it can be modified to take care of

London. May 9. (Correspond"
ence of The Associated Press.)
This is the history as told by
authorities here of the widespread
fated uprising in Ireland which
plunged the Emerald Isle, for a
period, into a reign of bloodshed
and destruction. It is a story to
the effect that the Sinn Fein or
ganization was used as a pawn in
the game played by Berlin, and
revolutionists in America, and of
how the failure of the revolt was
made doubly sure by the Inabil
ity of Germany to carry out im
portant feature of the plan. These
facts have been gathered from
authentic British sources and are
presented under the censorship.
The plot had its inception shortly
after the beginning of the war when
certain Irishmen and German authori
ties conceived the idea of utilizing the
Sinn Fein organization for a revot
the Germans being actuated by the
purpose of weakening Great Britain
and the others having a desire to ob
tain revenue for alleged political
wrongs. At that time the Sinn Fein
ers, who had organized because of
jealousy of nationalist vounteers, had
no definite idea of starting a revolu
tion. They accepted the plan, how
ever, and eventually fell victims to
the scheme.
The name of Sir Roger Casement
appears prominently throughout the
story.
Sir Roger went from America to
Christiania late in 1914 under an as
sumed name. He conferred with the
German consul and proceeded to Ger
many. Coincident with his arrival in
Berlin certain officials placed their
guarantees of assistance back of an
Irish rebellion. It was thought a
revolution could be successful and
plans for furthering the movement
made. According to this account Ger
many agreed to furnish money, arms
and men to assist the Sinn Feiners
and is said to have agreed to an in
vasion of England which would pre
vent soldiers being sent into Ireland
by the British.
America Tsed as Medium.
America was made the medium of
communication between Berlin and
Ireland. Certain Irishmen in the
United States enlisted their services
and Captains Boy-ed and von Papen,
the then German naval and military
attaches at Washington, together with
numerous others, some of whom are
now under arrest in America, are said
to have done their part in furthering
the plans. The carrying of funds and
information to the Sinn Feiners was
done largely by Irish sympathizers in
America who were able to visit their
home and without question.
Shorty after Casement's arrival in
Germany he published charges that
that the British minister at Christiania
had tried to have him assassinated.
His accusations against the British
minister are said to have been the in
itial step in a publicity campaign to
gain sympathy.
The next intelligence received in
London concerning Sir Roger was
brought by returning soldiers who re
ported that he was trying to recruit
Irish soldiers from prison camps to
fight against England. Some men
agreed to his proposition, were given
freedom and furnished with the green
uniform of the Sinn' Feiners. This lot
ting went on until Xovember, 1915.
Then there was a lull. The Germans
had grown tired of Casement. Case
ment himself retired to Munich, where
it was reported he was in poor health.
Germans Tire of Casement.
After a considerable spell of com
parative inactivity, those persona in
the United States who were taking a
part in the engineering of the revolu
tion became weary of waiting for de
velopments and sent a man to see Case-
