London, May 21. A force of Rus
sian cavalry has Joined the British
army on the Tigris in Mesopotamia.
An unofficial communication Issued
tonight concerning the situation ulong
the Tigris follows:
"Oners I Iiko reports that on the
nineteenth the enemy vacated llcthn
rrts advanced positions on the right
tmiik of the Tigris. General Gorringe,
following up I'"" enemy, attacked and
carried the Dujailam redoui)t. The
enemy In still holding the Sannayyat
position on the left bank of the river.
A Feat of paring.
' "A force of Russian cavalry has
joined General Gorringe after a bold
anil adventurous ride."
The first news of the operations on
the Tigris since the fall of Kut-ol-Amara,
Bent today by Lieut, fien. Sir
Percy Luke, commniHler of the Itrit
ish forces in Mesopotamia, although
Jt shows that the Turks are still hold
ing the Sannayyat position on the left
bank of the Thirls, where the British
check mad" It impossible to cany out
the relief of !eneral Townshend,
brings the welcome but astonishing
intelligence that a hotly of Russian
cavalry, after an adventurous ride,
has succeeded In joining General Gor
riiiKf.s forces on the south bank of
the Tigris.
Details Still Unknown.
How this Important Junction was
effected is still unknown, and the
story will be awaited with intense in
terest. The supposition is that till
deutfhment .nunc from the regular
army which is threatening- Khanikai,
hut it still remains a puzzle where and
bow the Russians succeeded In cross
ing the river.
Their sudden appearance with Gen
pritl Corringe also has raised the
question whether the Hussions have
already cut the Bagdad railway at
Mosul. In any case, the unexpected
appearance of this body of cavalry is
as great a surprise as was the first
landing of the Russian troops at Mar
seilles, and is another instance of the
swift and stealthy movement of the
Hiissian forces in Asia Minor.
