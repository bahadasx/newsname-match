TRAINS BRINGING
MANY TO CITY TO
SEE BIG PICTURE
"The Birth of a Nation" Opens Five
Day Engagement at Grand
Theater.
AUDIENCE OVERWHELMED
BT IMMENSITY OF DRAMA
Details of Play Noticeably Complete
When Picture is Seen Second
Time.
Every train into Bemidji today
brought crowds of people from var
ious points in this district to this
city to attend "The Birth of a Na
tion" and to take advantage of the
many bargains offered by the Bemidji
merchants.
"The Birth of a Nation" opened at
the Grand theater yesterday for a
five-day engagement. There was
good attendances at the performances
yesterday.
Good Business.
Merchants reported excellent out
of-town business.
After witnessing the performance
of "The Birth of a Nation" one real
izes more than ever that war is what
Sherman said it was. In this world's
masterpiece is painted the grim trag
edy of warwar in all its cruelties.
One sees not only the tragedy on the
field of battle, but in the home where
wait the aged parents and little
brother and sister, or daughter or
son, for the message that too often
comes, telling the dear one has died
for the flag.
Swirl of Emotions.
For three hours the spectator is
swept along in a swirl of emotions
and in those three hours history of
fifteen years is seen. No part of the
picture lagged as the film was cut
down to a fine point. When one sees
the play for the first time he is over
whelmed by the immensity of it. It
is an epic of a proud people beaten
into the dust and refusing to stay
there. The realism of the work is
amazing.
Play on Passions.
The music of the 30-piece sym
phony orchestra accentuates the pic
tures. The passions of love hate and
anger are played upon by the music
and the spectacle combined. Three
hours slip by quickly and when the
play is over one is convinced that it
is the most glorious accomplishment
in any art that he or she has ever
seen.
Many Bemidji people who witness
ed the performance yesterday are
planning to witness the production
for the second time The point that
stands out strongly on a second visit
is the detail of the play. In detail
"The Birth of a Nation" is astonish
ingly complete and there is some
thing profitable in it for the enthu
siasts who see the picture five or 3ix
times.
Can Bead Words.
The acting in every scene is so
good that it is possible to read from
the lips of the actors practically
every word spoken. In such a scene
as that in which the surrender of
Lee to Grant is portrayed, it is al
most a certainty that the signature,
"Robert E. Lee," was actually writ
ten upon the paper by the actor im
personating the great southern gen
eral. The words of the song sung
by Elsie Stoneman in the northern
hospital where the "Little Colonel"
lies wounded could probably be cop
ied verbatim. There is no -doubt but
that the soldier shown in a "dose
up" playing the assembly call upon
a bugle actually played the familiar
notes when the picture was taken.
Acting is Good.
One of the greatest pieces o* act
ing in the drama is that of Robert
Harron in the part of Tod Stoneman
in the scene portraying the death of
the two chums, one from the north
and the other from the south. In
this scene Tod Stoneman, in the act
of plunging his bayonet into his fall
en opponent, recognizes him as Duke
Cameron, his best friend. As he
pauses, there is a flash of smoke be
hind him, and it requires the firmest
hold on oneself to realize that it is
all acting, and that Harron himself
has not been drilled through a vital
spot by a bullet. There is no more
touching picture in all literature
than that of the two boys dying in
each other's arms.
The work of Henry Wathall as
Colonel Ben Cameron cannot be ex
aggerated.
Bich in Sympathy.
The part of Flora, the pet sister, is
rich in sympathy, and offering in
many respects still greater oppor
tunities. In this character Mae
Marsh surpasses every piece of fem
inine acting ever seen on the screen.
She rises to her highest art, not in
the death scene, which is touchingly
pathetic, but in the scene depicting
her sudden transition from the stun-

FIFTEEN MEMBERS
OF NAVAL MILITIA
G00NSH0RT CRUISE
(By a "Tar.")
Fifteen members of the Bemidji
division of the Minnesota Naval Mili
tia took advantage of the first short
weekfjend cruise given this season on
Lake Superior, Saturday and Sunday.
In spite of the fact that a large per
centage of those taking the trip were
experienced in military tactics on
board ship, several members furnish
ed mirth for the entire crew.
Leaving the harbor at Duluth at
"eight bells" (twelve o'clock) the
good ship Gopher with its crew of
rookies, steamed to Bark Bay where
they spent Sunday. Signal men re
ceived drilling along practical lines,
while the boat crews held their daily
manouvers. Other practices and
drills were held.
Life on the ship, with its various
duties, proved too strong for the
health of some of the Bemidji-boys
and several gave themselves up as
sick in order to escape the strenuous
duties of real seamen.
"Hammock Ladders," "Green Oil,"
"Mainmast Keys" and "Birds in Wa
ter" sounded too real to several of
the Bemidji boys who were sent for
them by the regulars and their su
perior officers, which furnished
amusement for the entire ships'
crew.
Those from Bemidji who took the
cruise were Lieutenant R. B. Lycan,
William Laliberte, A. Natigle, E. Lar
son, John Hedges, Earl Thurber, Rus
sell Brooks, Howard Palmer, Eddie
Ripple, Joseph Lagennesy, Merle
Spencer, Hovey Lord, Max Bell, Ed
win Simons and George Morrison.
Other men from the Duluth and
Crosby divisions completed the crew.

PRIMARY LAW IS
BIG THING UP TO
STATELEGISLATURE
JAMES A. PETERSON.
James A. Peterson of Minneapolis,
Republican candidate for lieutenant
governor, is a visitor in Bemidji to
day.
The primary law is one of the big
gest things before the state legisla
ture next year, according to Mr. Pet
erson "I look to see the state pri
mary law and the presidential pri
mary laws amended at the next ses-
sion," said Mr Peterson today to a
Pioneer representative.
"I believe that Amendment No. 1,
providing for the revolving fund for
the reclaiming of state lands, will
pass. When one goes through
Northern Minnesota he sees that
something must be done for the re
claiming of the lands."
