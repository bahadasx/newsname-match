A largo audience filled the audito

men last evening to listen to tho bac
calaureate sermon, delivered by Rev.
If. E. Van Horn, I). D of the First
Christian church, of Oklahoma City.

"Nearer My God to Thee." Prayer was !
then f.ffered by Rev. O. Lylo Smith.
Taking for his theme the 2!!rd, 21th,
2rith, 2iHh and 27th verses of the 11th
chapter of Hebrews, especially the
21th and 2"th verses, Dr. Van Horn
ppoke of the "Elective In the Uni
versity of Life."
The speaker. In an effort to show
that the greatest victory which the
pcinon junt beginning to wage the
battle of life might hope to win could
be won only through the election, in
the first charge of the battle, to serve
the people of the world; to forget the
Importance of self, the ambitions of
I' ll and wage the war of life In the
interests of humanity.
In bringing out this point. Dr. Van
Horn dwelt at length upon the oppor
tunities for satisfying ambition which
Moses, the great Israelite, passed up
when, as the foster son of I'haroah's
daughter, ho declined the crown, the
nival purple and the kingly ermine of
the Egyptian monarch and turned to
yhis own people. "Moses was the child
S the loins of Israel; he was born in
bondage of a woman; he was reared
In the lap of luxury through a fortu
nate chance, ordained by the divine
mind."
In further showing how the great
est good In life may be obtained
through the sacrifice of self and all
n'dflsh motives, the speaker showed
then that when the psychological mo-
1 1
I:
nent came, Moses, the nntural son of
nrael and the adopted son of Egypt,
saw fit to turn from the flesh pots of
the country of his adoption and util
ize the education which his foster
mother had given him In becoming one
of his own people.
"Renouncing the kingly crown; re
nouncing the golden fleece of power,
the educated Jew turned to his peo
ple, turned to the people who had
served in bondage for over 400 years
and elected to use the education which
he bad received In striking from
their limbs the shackles of that bond
age, the IronB of their slavery; he re
jected all the honors, all the glories,
all the riches to which his education
entitled him and elected to become a
servant of God, a servant of human
ity." The speaker then sought to Im
press upon the class that the college
course they were finishing had but
placed them where they would be
called upon to elect what further
courso In education they would take
"Moses, when his education was com
pleted, elected to servo the people;
tic you are to elect whom you will

graduated from any school, is fitted
to something and to do that some
thing well. The tragedy of life is nev
er brought about by following one's
own natural aptitude; each person is
mentally fitted to fill some particular
niche; the tragedy is brought about
by disregarding the commands of
God and attempting to do something
v.hfch the person Is unfitted for.
"n showing that the Divlno grid-
ance should be followed, the speaker
averred that the education but fitted

which he was intended. Mozart, the

sounds from its bosom when blit a

JURORS TO
TRY WAITE
SELECTED
Dentist Faces Court on Charge of Poison
ing Wealthy Parents of Wife;
Sensational Story Due to
Be Revealed
Oy T'nlted Press.
New York. May 22. -Cool and un
concerned, Dr. Waite went to trial in
a crowded court room here, charged
with murdering his father-in-law, John
Peck. The jury was selected in the
record time of three hours.
New York. May 22. With the open
ing of the trial of young Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite here today on the
change of poisoning his millionaire
parents-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. John
Peck of Grand Rapids, Mich., there
begins to pour into the dry records of
the New York supreme court one of
the most, sensational and astounding
stories of fortune-hunting, illicit love,
murder, intrigue and deception that
has ever been disclosed, as the alleg
ed record of one man.
Waite's formal plea was "not guil
ty," but he may change it today.
The titate will attempt to prove that
the slender, nattily attired, smiling
youth who sits quietly before a long
table in this drab and silent court
room, deliberately wooed and married
Clara Peck with the preconceived in
tention of murdering her, her father
and mother and any other persons it
might be necessary to murder in order
that he might get possession of the
Peck millions.
' The statd will introduce evidence
to prove that Waite, married to Clara
Peck and having Mrs. Elizabeth Hor
ton as his "Studio Companion" in a
big New York hotel, actually did get
Mr. and Mrs. Peck to New York on a
visit and murder them by poisoning
them with arsenic.
Thnt he got his wife to w ill her es
tate to him and was planning her
murder as the third of the series In
his alleged scheme to get the Peck
millions.
And that after murdering his mother-in-law
and engineering the crema?
tlon of her body to prevent the dis
covery of the vauso of her death, he
bribed a Now York undertaker with
$9,000, ($7,800 of this amount was
found whore tho undertaker told the
police he hid it), to swear that arsenic
was used In the fluid employed in the
embalming of his father-in-law's body.
With his wife turned against him
and prosecuting her suit for divorce,
and Margaret Horton, his "Studio
Companion," fresh from the triumphs
of a vaudeville engagement won as a
result of the publicity she gained from
her association with him, Waite faces
his fight against the electric chair
without the support either of the wo
man he married or the woman he
squandered his money on.

On, Saturday of last week, Mrs. O.
C. Kell, daughter of Mrs. Elizabteh J.
Skaggs, who was found dead in a field
on her fnrm near Chickasha Thurs
day, May IS. appeared before Judge
Davenport, of the county court, and
asked that an administrator be ap
pointed and that O. C. Kell be named
as custodian of the estate, stating
that strangers were making free with
the personal effects of the dead wo
man. This morning Welborne and Bailey,
attorneys for George H. Masoner, a
son of Mrs. Skaggs, appeared In court
and filed for probate what purports
to be the .last will and testament of
the deceased. The will leaves all the
personal property to the son, G. H.
Masoner, and gives him possession of
the real estate for the period of 20
years; at the expiration of that pe
riod the will decrees that the real es
tate shall be sold and the daughter,
Mrs. G. C. Kell, shall receive $100 or
the proceeds of the sale, the remain
der to go to the son.
The will is written in lead pencil,
signed by Mrs. Elizabeth. J. Skaggs
and bears date of April 20, 1916. It
is not witnessed.
Judge Davenport has set June 5th
for final hearing in the matter.
In. the county court this 'morning
approval by the court was asked of
the deed of Mrs. Hosea Waldon, a
full blood Chickasaw, to certain, prop
erties in Grady county. Action upon
the application was passed for the
present.
WILLIAMS
CANDIDATE
Announcing his candidacy for the
Democratic nomination for county at
torney, Judge N. M. Williams issues
the following statement:
I think it is proper where a person
announces his candidacy for public
office to make some indication as to
how he will exercise the extraordina
ry powers conferred upon him by vir
tue of his office in the event of his
election; especiall is this so when one
announces for the office of county at
torney, which to my notion is the
most responsible and important office
to be filled in the county, district
judge and county judge not excepted.
In making such a statement I un
derstand that its force and effect will
be governed by the confidence and
good faith in the person making the
statement and his ability to carry the
same into execution.
To my notion one of the most im
portant matters receiving the atten
tion ot the county attorney is to con
duct the affairs of the county with
Which he is connected, in such a way
as to reduce the burdsn' of taxation
to the lowest possible frgure, and with
this in view and as an indication of
his good faith he should
county the sum of $2100
sistant during his termof office. I
believe that in the first two years af
ter statehood, when the whiskey vio
lators were testing out the sufficieu
sy and the determination ot our offi
cers and citizenship to enforce the
prohibition law there was need for an
assistant to the county attorney but
judging from the work demanded of
this office for the past five years I
believe that a fairly good lawyer can
attend to these duties and still es
cape an attack of nervous prostration
from overwork.
In the matter of prohibition enforce
ment I think it should be vigorous and
effectual, and with economical admin-
istration, and with this in view I j indignation meetings, enlarging on a
would in addition to individual prose- twenty-line paragraph ot lnstruc
cutions envoke the arm of the lawjtions entitled, "Correct Dress at the
that confiscates personal and real , Coming Biennial," published under
property, that is used in the sale of , the name of Miss Mary A. Peck,
Intoxicants, which has been fully sus
tained by our courts of last resort.
I think it is the duty ot the county
attorney to especially try out that
provision which makes a second con
viction a felony or penitentiary ol -
fense and I would not compromise by
Dermitting the offender to move out,
of the state pending an appeal, for if
the act is unconstitutional we want to
know it so a good and valid law can

from the long trains pulling into -Grand

and Hudson terminal from California,
Florida, Maine and other parts of the
country, they are taken in hand by

There has been evidence of soma
rather sharp feeling between the City

of style, which may crop up in some
form during the convention.
The only open display of feeling; ba
