standing that an attempt will be made
to place a 2V2c rate in force by order
of the corporation commission, and
thus end the rate litigation. The
Missouri, Kansas & Texas offered to
accept a rate of 2 1-Gc two weeks

It is thought this line will ac-

will follow. Anxiety of the Katy for
settlement of the case has revived
the old rumor that the Katy is to
be acquired by the New York Central

STATE FIREMEN MEET
Local Firemen Leave for Convention.
Meet at Cushing Tomorrow.
Chief of the Fire Department Roed
er, Delegate McFall and Commission
er London left today for Cushing,
where they go to attend the annual
convention of the State Firemen's
association.
A few years ago the convention was
held in this city, and attracted many
visitors. It was the intention of the
local delegation to invite the con
vention to come to this city next year,
but Chief Reeder stated this morning
that after consulting with the Busi
ness Men's association, in view of
the fact that there were many other
I things in contemplation for another
year, and as it would require at least
a thousand dollars to entertain the
visitors, this amount would have to
be raised among the business men,
and it seemed an imposition to ask
them to donate this money. For that
reason, Ardmore will not be mention
ed as the next place of meeting of
the association. The annual conven
tion begins at Cushing tomorrow
morning, and the local delegation
will arrive in time for the opening.
Dr. Howard S. Cox of this city left
a rpsterdav mornine for Kemp City,

a 'affairs of his brother. The latter and

a the storm. Their little daughter ii

JUDGE FREEH
IS ASSAULTED
LAST SATURDAY
MASS MEETING GROWING OUT
OF THE SENSATION WILL BE
HELD AT DIG TABERNACLE TO
NIGHT. Ardmore had a sensation thrust
upon it Saturday afternoon when Bud
Hallew, a deputy sheriff, slapped the
face of Judge W. F. Freeman in front
of the Felker grocery store on Main
street. The judge did not resent the
blows. The deputy slapped his face
and the judge's hat fell to the side
walk, lie stooped and picked It up,
and as he arose Mr. Ballew', it is
reported, slapped his face again.
Neither of the parties to the trouble
has been interviewed by this paper,
but the causes which led up to the
assault grew out of the court of In
quiry which the court has been hold
ing. The court seems to have been
of the opinion that Deputy Ballew was
either interested in a road house lo
cated two miles west of Lone Grove,
or was giving protection to the per
sons operating it. Tho deputy re
sented the charge against him and
became impatient after several weeks
of worry over it.
Judge Freeman has been holding
courts of inquiry for several months
and at one time he published a notice
in The Ardmoreite giving the history
of a certain case that was in his
court. No reply was made by the
persons on the other side of the con
troversy at that time.
There promises to be another chap
ter of the sensation tonight at the
tabernacle where Dr. M. B. Williams
has been holding a series of union
meetings. A call has been made fur
a mass meeting of both men and
women to begin at 7:13 tonight in
the tabernacle and the subject for
discussion at this meeting will be the
efforts made by Judge Freeman to
rid the county of the liquor evil and
also the assault that was made upon
him by the deputy sheriff. The pros
pects are that a vast number will
bfr present at the meeting. The no
tice which came to The Ardmoreite
calling the meeting indicates that
it was called in the belief that Judge
Freeman is doing his part in the at
tempt to enforce the law and that
the officer who assaulted him was in
i the wrong.
The affair will enter largely into
(i,o p-imnnlEii this summer in the
I county and much Interest will be man
I ifostcd in the discussion until it is
finally Ironed out, and all is peace
again.
PRDTESTTO
FURTHER PROTEST AGAINST IN
TERFERENCE WITH UNITED
STATES MAILS TO BE SENT TO
ENGLAND.
Washington, May 22. A new note
to Great Britain protesting further
against interference with American
mails was laid before President Wil
son today and probably will be sent
to London tomorrow. The general
terms of tho note were framed at
the Mate department, but the presi
dent is including some of his own
language.

TABERNACLE
SERVICES ARE
NOW CLOSED
FAREWELL SERMON LAST NIGHT
WAS LISTENED TO BY AN IM
MENSE CROWD WHICH PACKED
THE BUILDING.
The Williams tabernacle meetings
closed Sunday ni.iit. All day Sunday
was le:i:e with cumulative interest.
The storm rained us out Saturday
night, except a few dozen people. By
Sunday morning the sky had cleared
with a most beautiful Oklahoma day.
Many hundreds winded their way to
tho place of worship at an early hour.
With no particular flourish of trum
pets the pt ople made a generous free
will offering to Dr. Williams as a to-
k 'u of appreciation for his splendid
work in our midst for the last live
weeks, lie came to us without any
guarantee of a stipulated amount. It
was agreed that on tin? last day of
the campaign we would give him the
entire offerings made at the three ser
vices. But of his own accord, and
most generously, Dr. Williams said he
would accept only the Sunday morn
ing offering. It is characteristic of
all Dr. Williams' meetings always and
everywhere that he leaves a most de
lightful spirit behind him. The many
interruptions tuid tho Iscul weather
had interfered greatly with tho col
lections for current expenses. Dr. Wil
liams did not want to have any s'ueh
troublesome amounts left behind him,
which explains his generous propo
sition. Dr. Welth made a statement, after
Dr. Williams had retired and before
the offering was made, concerning
certain runi'ors that had been set
afloat about our evangelist since his
coming to our city. These, he said, had
been run down and traced to their
source, and had been laid before Dr.
Williams. He said "Dr. Cooper and
myself have gone to headquarters
and come before you with authority,
with first-hand information and we de
clare unto you that any and all re
marks from any source which in any
way reflect upon the character of Dr.
WiUiams as a man, a gentleman, a
Christian, and a minister of the gospel
while in our city and as the guest
of all our churches, are utterly false,
malicious and of the devil in every
particular." You ought to have heard
that congregation cheer. They shouted
aliens, clapped their hands, shouted
approvals, they iro;-e in mass and
continued their vociferous demonstra
tions. A similar attack was made on
Dr. Bulgin while he was here and
continued sifter he was gone. Ardmore
lives such people to understand, now,
here, and forever after, that reputable
men of God who have come to bless
our city cannot be successfully attack
ed. Notice is hereby served on them
that tlfcir absence is more welcome
than their presence, and they need
not stay on the order of their going.
Dr. Williams' morning address,
much shorter than usual, was on the
Eternal Love Story from John 3:16.
It was & beautiful discussion of the
"Old, Old Story," of which no report
can be made here. The amount of
the free will offering made to Dr. Wil
liams will be announced later.
Sunday night the great tabernacle
was packed and jammed with humani
ty. People were awake to the fact
that an unusual man had been in our
midst. His resourcefulness is most re
markable in every way. He had de
livered a great address at the high
j school in the afternoon and was ready
j for the great closing effort of our
'meetings. He rose to our highest ex
ipectations. After a few preliminaries
and a special offering for current ex
penses, he began his sermon on Hebs.
3:15 "The Hardening of the Heart,"
or the "Unpardonable Sin," was his
topic. He preached with tremendous
power and carried his great audience
with him. The Spirit of God came
I mightily upon the people. There were
more than thirty inquiries forward
for prayers, and most of these were
adults, and some heads of families.
I The meeting held till nearly eleven
j o'clock, and the people seemed loath
;to deparL
The series of meetings has been pe
jculiar in, a:any ways, in interruptions
in the ebb and flow of Interest. But
an immense amount of good has been
done not only in our own city, but in
the towns surrounding Ardmorv. Dr.
Williams has won for himself a large
and laming place in the hearts of the
best people of Ardmore who are in
tensely loyal to him, and he will al
ways find a cordial welcome when he
can return to see us again, lie will
tarry for a day or so before leaving
for his homo in Chicago. Mr. and Mrs.
Bray have also won many friends
in our midst and cany away with
them our best wishes for them and
their work.
DEPUTY SHERIFF PHONED IN HIS
RESIGNATION BEFORE HE HAD
SEEN SHERIFF GARRETT AFTER
ASSAULT.
Immediately following the trouble
Saturday afternoon, in which Bud
Hallew slapped the face of District
Judge W. F. Freeman, Mr. Ballew
went to the city police station and
made bond for his appearance Mon
day, to answer lo the charge of dis
turbing t he peace, and then before he
had seen Sheriff Garrett he telephon
ed in his resignation. In other words
he "beat the sheriff to if and gave
up his office as deputy. Mr. Ballew
probably knew full well that he would
not be permitted to remain on the
force, as he knows Sheriff Garrett
mighty well, and he did not run the
risk of being asked to resign, but
hastened in his resignation over the
phone before the sheriff demanded it.
Bud Ballew stilted yesterday that
he was never accused of dealing in
liquor or ever having anything to do
with it until he was sworn In as a
deputy sheriff. Following his taking
tlie oath of office insinuations and
charges have been mado until he
completely lost his patience and let
his temper lead him to do what he
should not have done.
Bud Ballew is a good business man,
and it was at a financial sacrifice that
he entered the service of tho county.
He has done much work in the oil
fields, and has entered places there
at times when an older head would
not have gone. Oil fields, like mining
camps, are hard to control, but the
reputation of Sheriff Garrett and his
men has kept many of the toughest
men out' of the field who are in the
habit of going from one field to an
ot her.
