German Effort to Recapture
Haudremont Quarries De
feated Wtih Heavy Loss.
PAltIS, Ma; 22. French grenadiers
occupied several blockhouses In Avo
court Wood on the Verdun front In
the course of severe fighting last
night.
Following Is the text of the War
Offlce Statement:
"To the south of Berry-au-TUc
French forces exploded two mines
with success at Hill No. 108.
"In the Champagne district a gas
attack by the Germans was without
result. This emission of gas was In
the zone between the road from
Soualn to Somme-Py and the road
from Palnte Hllalre to Saint Souplel.
No sooner had the cloud of gas
started than an unexpected turn In
the direction of the wind drove It
back upon the trenches of the enemy.
"On thn left bank of the river
Meuse Infantry lighting continued
last night. In the wood of Avocourt
our grenadiers secured some advan
tages and occupied several block
houses evacuated by the enemy.
"In the region to the west of Dead
Man Hill the fighting has been par
ticularly ferocious. Several tentatlves
mad. by thn enemy to further their
progress have been checked by our
curtains of Are and by the activity of
our machiiin guns, A lgorous attack
by our troops made It possible for us
to lecapture a portion of tho ground
lost during the night of May 21.52.
"On the right bank of the Meue
th'n Germans have delivered repeated
counter-attacks upon the positions at
the Haudremont Quarries captured
by the French .yestetday. Kach uf
the'adwince movements was checked
by our tire and cost the Germans
heavy losses. In the outskirts of tho
village of Vaux a small operation oxe.
cuted this morning put us In posses,
elon of a German trench. At Eparges
several German mines have been ex
ploded, but without causing damage
to the Frenoh position."
The battle of Verdun entered on its
fourth month to-day. The Germans,
with characteristic patience and stub,
bornness, are hammering at Dead
Man Hill, where the most furious and
bloody fighting of the three months'
conflict has taken place. Fighting
desperately for the trenches that they
wrested from the French on the lower
slopes of the hill, the Teutons have
hurled 60,000 men, backed by sixty
batteries of guns of all calibres, for.
ward along a seven-mllo front from
Avocourt Wood to the Meuse in a des
perate effort to seize the coveted
summit.
That the Germans must contfhuo
their tremendous onslaught on Dead
Man Hill or abandon the Idea of tak
ing Vordun aeems obvious. This
blood-soaked summit and Its sister
eminence, Hill No. 304, form the key
of tbo whole system of Verdun's de
fenscs.

Journeying to Oyster Day to call upon
the Colonel and tell him bow neces

Colonel will reply In an Impromptu
