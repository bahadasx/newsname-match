COLUMBUS. N. M„ May 22—Four
bands of Mexican bandits are mov
ing north in the wake of the with
drawing American troops, commit
ting depredations and spreading ter
ror in the Tillages. This report was
brought' to the Columbus base today.
It is believed here that the Mexicans
•who fired on thirteen troopers of the
Seventh cavalry, woAttdlng one, were
members of one of these bands.
These bandits are moving In bands
of from fifty to seventy and have
flkept
far enough behind the retiring
Americans to avoid a clash. Many
inhabitants of the region around Ban
Antonio, Mexico, are fleeing north
In the wake of the American troops.
General Pershing has sent back
cavalry detachments to attajtk and
disperse these bands.
Stories that the American troops
"*are withdrawing because Villa had
recovered and was recruiting an
army to fight the American troops,
have been circulated among the
Mexican peons and are believed re
sponsible for the new outbreak of
banditry.
Several road-repairlrife machines
have been received here and are be
ing sent south along the Pershing
lines of communication to repair the
roads which have been well-nigh
Impassable.
Situation Unchanged Today.
I By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, May 22.—Secre
tary of War Baker revealed today
that he has been* officially advised of
the refusal of 116 Texas militiamen
to be sworn in for border duty. The
department is carefully considering
the subject, he said.
Under the Dick law, these men may
be oourtmartialed and fined, though
they cannot be forced Into service
Baker declined to indicate his atti
tude In the matter, until he has more
'complete details. As far as his mes
sages go, merely the fact of the re
fusal was established.
Mexico City dispatches quoting
General Obregon as saying the situa
tion is acute because American forces
penetrated Mexico below the Big
IBand, brought the statement from
Baker that as far as he knew the
question of the crossing had not been
discussed in the recent Scotfc-Obregon
conferences.

,1( "s
y^K
In so far as has been revealed, the
only discussion of the Big Bend situa
tion was Obregon's agreement to dis
patch a force of Caranzlstas to the
district south of the Bend to aid In
rounding up border raiders.
In as much as Colonel Sibley has
announced his intention of withdraw
ing the second expedition, it is
thought the situation In the Big Bend
may not become an acute Issue,
though If Obregon is correctly quoted,
officials feel there Is a possibility of
further diplomatic difficulty with Car
ranza.
Administration men characterised
the Mexican situation today as vir
tually unchanged. Border raid re
ports they said have been exaggerat
ed.

Consul Rogers is stlU friendly.

Another Note Coming.
WASHINGTON, May 22.—Private
advices from Mexico City today said
another note from General Carranza
to the state department on the pres
ence of American troops in Mexico
was despatched this morning. It has
not yet been received by the Mexican
embassy. Mexico City advices to the
Btate department from Consul Rod

any communication with Carranza
will be In friendly terms.
HAD PLENTY OF WARNING
OF IRISH REVOLUTION
Testimony Shows That Offi
cials Were Told of the
Situation.
HJONJXXN, May 22.—Viscount Mid
dleton, former secretary of war, to
day accused Augustine Birr
ell, form
er chief secretary for Ireland, of lax
dealings with the Irish rebels,
testimony before the royal commis
sion, Investigating the rebellion.
"I notified the Irlafh government
that the Sinn Feiners were becoming
very active and declared I thought
the government program Inadequate
to cope with them," said Middlefcon.
"I particularly urged the disarming
of the vohinteers.
"Mr. Birrell said the whole Sinn
Fein movements was laughable and
should not be taken seriously."
Mlddleton's statement that he had
warned Premier Asquith of the ser
iousness of the situation in Ireland,
•was one of the sensations of today's
testimony. He declared that he
Placed all the facts before the prime
minister on January 26.
Asqulth evidently called the mat
ter to the attention of Birrell. A
month later Birrell wrote Middleton:
"To proclaim the volunteers Illegal
and put them down by foroe would
be recklms and foolish and snonn
«osly
'Middleton said he told Sir Matthew
Nathan, under secretary for Ireland,
in April that the situation was so
bad even the life of John Redmond,
Irish leader, was endangered.
IMlddleton said he warned Lord
Wln*bonrne, lord lieutenant of Ire
land. only six days before the out
break, that grave results would fol
low if no action was taken. Others,
he said, gave similar warnings.
A war office representative virtual
ly gave the lie to Augustine Birrell,
former chief secretary for Ireland,
who testified that he had made sev
eral requests for additional troops
for Ireland. Adjutant General Mac
rady, of the war office, in a letter
read before the commission, said that
so far as he knew, Birrell had never
requested the war office to send
troops for the purpose of anticipating
the rebellion and overawing the
Sinn Feiners.
Birrell then resumed the witness
box repeating his earlier statements
that he had had several interviews
wKh the authorities in which he ex
pressed the desire for more troops.

LONDON, May 22.—For the first
time since the beginning of the war,
Russian and English land forces are
now fighting side by side—in the Gar
den of Eden region at Mesopotamia.
News of the bold dash of the Russian
cavalry squadron into the British
camp east of Kut-EI-Amara caused
more astonishment In London than
the reports of the arrival of the first
Russian contingents In France.| Ad
vance rumors of the coming of the
Russians to- Marseilles had reached
here, but last night's bulletin from
the war office was the first inltmation
that any Slav force was within 150
miles of the British forces.
Military critics today warned the
general public against excessive op
timism as the result of General Lake's
brief announcement. They pointed
out that it Is highly Improbable that
the main body of Russians can affect
a junction with the British for an ad
vance on Bagdad for several weeks
and that In all probability the Slavs
will advance on Bagdad from the
north Instead of Joining the British
near Kut-EI-Amara.
The only previous Instance In which
Russian and English forces have Join

MILITIAMEN ARE QUITTERS
VIENNA, May 22.—Massing" In
heavy force on the southern Tyrol
front, Italians are making desperste,
but unsuccessful, attempts to stem
the Austrian invasion of Italy.
Throughout Saturday, the Italian
commanders hurled their Alpine
forces at the Austrian crogvn prince's
lines in desperate counter attacks.
Each onslaught was repulsed. An offi
cial statement from the Austrian war
office reports the capture of several
more Italian positions and the taking
of 3,000 prisoners. About 16,000 Ital
ians, including many officers, have
been captured since the Austrlans be
gan their offensive a week ago.
The Italian attacks were of great
est violence In the Astioo valley,
where the Austrlans for the first time
sinoe the beginning of the war have
obtained a foothold on Italian soil.
It is believed here that King Victor
Emanuel, now at the Italian front,
has ordered Austrlans cleared from
Italian territory by Tuesday at any
cost. Tuesday is the first anniver
sary of the beginning of the Austro
Itallan war.
"The fighting In southern Tyrol, on
the Lavarone plateau, Increaaed In
violence as the result of enemy at
tacks," said the official statement.
"We now hold the summit of Armen
tara ridge. On the Lavorne plateau
we penetrated the first hostile posi
tions.
"The troops of the Arch Duke
Charles Francis Joseph (the crown
prince) added to their successes.
They captured the Cima Del Laghl
and the Cima Di Nesole. The enemy
was driven from Borgola pass toward
the south. We captured three more
twenty-eight centimeter howitzers.
"We advanced toward Monte Pasu
bio and Occupied Anghobenl.
"In Saturday's fighting we took
2,300 Italians, including elghtyfour
officers, twenty-five cannon and eight
machine guns."

Ridicule the Charge of

.. -t murder Wm. H. Orpet is on trial, had

thought of suicide on the day she

state and defense to have the trial
actually under way by Friday.

Farmers, their wives and families,
came into the city for a glimpse of
the lad whose trial is recorded as
the most sensational in the county's
history. Orpet was Uj? early and was
apparently rested and ready for an
other week's monotony.
The deposition made by David
James, deaf mui" of Lake Forest
who says he saw Marian Lambert
and Orpet in Helms woods together
a short time before the girl died,
bobbed up again today as Important.
A double Interpretation has been put
on James' statement that he saw
Orpet and the girl in an embrace in
the woods. The state claims that the
embrace was in reality a struggle and
that Orpet cast the girl from him,
first forcing her to take the poison.
The defense aesests what James saw
was the girfs final effort to bring him
back to her through her loving
caresses and that failing in this, she
took the poison which she brought to
the woods' trysting place.
The Orpet case is attracting atten
tion every place in Waukegan. In
come of the churches Sunday, it was
mentioned along with the sermons.
