THE SLEEPING DOVE MAXV HEAIt
EVANGELIST LAST NIGHT
Despite the threatening wcatlicrlast
night, tho Growers Warohouso wns
woll filled with peoplo coming from
nil sections ot tho city ot Maysvlllo.
Tho chorus singing has not been bet
ter than that of last night. Special
numbers wcro also sung by a quar
tette nnd by Earlo Yearsley. Tho lat
ter sang by request tho solo, "Some
Whore A Volco Is Cnlllng" the sacred
words to which wcro written by the
evangelist.
Tho address of the evening was one
of tho chnrnctorlstlcoliy good nios
tirtu's from Rov. Herbert Voucll. The
sermon was based on the Btory of tho
riot 0 which nfter tlyltig about found
It necessary to return to tho ark for
rest nnd protection. Ho described the
various wanderings, of the humnn In
senrch for plcnsurb which does not
satisfy. Tho spenkor's oratorlcnl
powers, his dramatic talents anil his
wonderful diction wero put to test
linn ho described In figurative lan
prins,c, the hypocrltu In tho church.
These persons might be considered as
enemies of the returning penitent who
like the dove litis found out In tho
"orld no rest. Hn had no pntlence
li'i tho man who could sco In the
(cliurrji none hut the hypocrite, human
rock-machos nr tii called them,
These various autmnln In theiirkdid
r-t prevent tho novo from mining
back to Its only place of real rest, nor
should tho whole menagrlo of hypo
crites ki(i any persou from coming
