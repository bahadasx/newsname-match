HUGHES ASSERTS
ROOSEVELT WILL
BE NOMINATED
Justice Says: "It Is Unneces

One Else."
QUOTED BY A SUPPORTER
Statement Made When Asked
to Authorize Campaign
in His Behalf.
FIRST WORDS ON "CANDIDACY"
Friends Declare Noted Republican Is
Perfectly Sincere and Content
to Remain on B ench.
The first statement by Asociate Jus- I
tic. Charles E. Hughes. of the United
States Supreme Court. on the Republi
can nomination for President, was ob
tained yesterday. He was quoted by a
leader in the Republican party favorable
to the pre-convention campaign for his
nomination.
Justice Hughes said:
"In my eoinion. -Roosevelt is going
to be naminated, so it makes it on
meemOa-y to disease any one eisa at
al"
0eat pressure had been brought to
bear upon Justice Hughes to authorize
cmpaign in his behalf. That was his
W1U Not Seek Nomination.
'tkstiea Hughes' statement was inter
preted by his supporters to mean that he
has made up his mind he will not connive
at setting the nomination, so that if he
should be named he may be able to say
tht while on the supreme bench he never
by word or deed sought the honor.
His friends declare he will not be dis
appointed if he is not nominated, that he
is perfectly sincere and oontent to re
main on the bench. His closest friends,
those most anxious to know his real at
titude toward the nomination, assert that
they are wholly without guidance or sug
gestion from him.
They believe, however, that Justice
Hughes will be controlled by the pres
ence or lack of unanimity of spirit at
the Chicago convention. They believe
he would refuse the nomination if it
should come to him after a hitter
fight.
Hitchcock in Tosn.
Frank Hitchcock, former Postmas
ter General, has been in Washington
for three days in the interest of the
rovcment for Hughes. He saw the
untice-. hut was unable to induce him

(87 The Sun News servies.)
New York, May 21.-The
aeroplane that broke all
records by flying from New
port News to the Sheepshead
Bay s eedway on Saturday in
four hours and one minute, has
been bought by the Aero Club
and will be armed with a two
pound gun and presented to
the New Mexico National
Guard to patrol the border air
lanes as protection against
Mexican bandit raids.
An expert aviator will be
sent to the border with the
machine.
Victor Carletrom and Seven
son Magordon, who drove the
machine in Saturday's flight,
have offered to fly it to the
border in much less time than
shipping would take, but lack
of gasoline stations along the
route probably will prevent.

to Be Witness for State.
(By the Sun News Service.)
New York, May 21.-The attitude of Dr.
Arthur Warren Waite amazes experts in
criminology. The dentist, who will he
called to trial tomorrow morning for the
murder by poison of his father-in-law,
John F. Peck, of Grand Rapids. Mich.,
seems overjoyed with the ordeal awaIt
ing him. Today he was in as good spirits
as if he had come into money or was
to take a wife.
Instead of co-operatin; with his law
yer, Walter R. Deuel. Waite has ham
pered and opposed him at every turn.
Taking the latitude allowable to counsel,
Deuel has painted Waite's case as white
as possible, denying and palliating and
excusing. Waite has blackened it heav
ily, confessing, even exaggerating. Deuel
pleads that Waite is crazy. Waite de
clares that he is sane now, and was sans
when he poisoned his mother-in-law and
his father-in-law. Dteuel says Wait,
doesn't know what he is talking about.
Waite asserts that he knows better than
any man-that his main Idea is to get
out of the world as quickly and thor
oughly as possible so as to win complete
expiation.
Case Without Parallel.
The case has no parallel in the recollec
tIon of court attaches, or in the records
of the district attorney's office. No one
can recall that a man or woman charged
with murde, has so deliberately tried tc
wreck a defensive cast. In the opinion
of District Attorney Swann, Waite's at
titude is interesting psychologicaly, but
not important as be-aring upon the dis
position of the eas-. Fortifled by more
than 10 witnesses, or depositions, evi
dence gathered in Grand Rapids and Ir
this city, and by the determinations of
alienists that Waite it entirely sane, the
district attorney will ask that the full
penalty be meted out.
le will present a case which in his
opiniorc has no weak link and Is utterly
conclusive of guilt. In opposition, ap
parently to Waite's onn wishes, the de
fense will be 'compilsive" insanity-the
mental twist which compels one to com
mIt crime while maintaining an ap
pcarance of sanity before the world.
Little Delay lxpected.
The trial will commence at 10 a. i. to
morrow in the crinilnal branch of the
Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence J.
Shearn on the bench. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Brothers will present the
State's cae, assisted by Assistant Dis
trict Attorney iolinz. Walter R, Deuc.
will dlef'i the dentist. It is expected
that a jury will he quickly obtained
that the box will be filled by Tuesday
evening. TIhereupon Mr. Brothers will
outline the case the State expects tc
'prove.
I Waite's father and mother and twc
- brothsrs have been doing what was pos
t sible in his interests, and will be in court
to give him their support Mrs. Mar
garet Weaver Horton, Waite's "soul
I ate" And "art amnity," will be a
w a itness for the State. Other witnesses
will he Miss Ellen Peck, Dr. Jacob Cor

GROUP OF TAFT MEN FORM
COMMITTEE TO DO WORK
George Von L Meyer Heads New Body.
Will Call Upon Colonel at
Oyster Bay Today.
fBy the sun News Service.)
New York. May 21.-A movement
that has the earmarks of an effort
to stampede the Republican national
convention for Col. Theodore Roose
ivelt Is underway. A group of Re
publicans, largely Taft men In 1912.
representing sentiment in at least
thirty States, have organized a "Roose
velt Republican committee," with
headquarters for the present at the
Bitmore Hotel, and with George von
L,. Meyer. Secretary of the Navy ur.
der Presidents Taft and Roosevelt. at
iti head.
The committee made known its ex
istence today. Tomorrow a dozen or
more of its members will call upon
the Colonel at Oyster Bay "to ask him
what he has to say."
The committee has been gathered
together with lightning-like rapidity
in the last four days. The Republic
ans who form its membership realize
that they are perhaps a trifle late in
getting started. but so encouraged are
they by sheaves of telegrams that
have poured into the committee's
suite that they expect to have enough
delegates rounded up for the Colonel
at Chicago to drive things his way.
Robert C. Morris, vice pres!dent of
the Union League Club, and former
Republican county chairman, who
spoke for the committee today in the
temporary absence of Mr. Meyer. em
phasized the fact that the movement
is strictly one within the Republican
party.
In many quarters it is regarded as
the trump card of the Roosevelt Re
publicans prior to the meeting of the
.delegates at Chicago two weeks from
Wednesday.
The members of the committee,
w'hfeh is a national body and country
wide in its personrel, have pledged
themselves to crystallize the Roo

German Editor Avers
CoL Roosevelt Lied
(By the Sum News Serviee.)
Chicago, May 21.-That Cot.
Roosevelt lied in his attack on
the Illinois Staats Zeitung in
his Detroit speech, is the sub
stance of a letter sent out to
day by Horace L. Brand, the
paper's editor.
"Roosevelt." Mr Brand says,
"is reported to have said, 'The
Illinois Staats Zetinng backs
the movement of the extreme
pacifists to keep the United
States impotent for self-de
fense.'
"That is a falsehood. The
Staats Zeitung backs the peace
patriots' movement 'for Trace
or war as our interest, guided
by justice, shall counsel.'
"If Roosevelt misrepresented
the attitude of the Illinois
Staats Zeitung because of his
ignorance then the falsehood
is none the less palpable."
