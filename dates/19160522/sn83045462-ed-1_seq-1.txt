Col. Roosevelt. according to a telegram
received today in Criminal Division

morning at 7:30 o'clock. He is to take
breakfast at the home of his daughter,
Mrs. Ijongworth. and after testifying
In the Riggs trial will leave for New
York at 11 a.m. .
Much of the morning session of the
trial was taken up bv the reading to
the jury by District Attorney Daskey
e* r**?rr??ST?ondenee between the Riggs i
National Bank, the National City Bank j
of New York and the Crocker National i
Bank of San Francisco, relating to a I
purchase from the San Francisco in- j
Stitution by the -National City Bank:
Of New .York of United States bonds'
at the suggestion of Milton E. Ailes,
vice president of the Riggs, which
bonds were later sold at an advance in
price.
Because or tne iacr inar part or inis
advance was credited to the Riggs
Bank, through the stock commission
account of the bank's officials, the government
introduces the correspondence
In an effort to show the character of
the account, although the defense is
objecting to its introduction on the
fxound that the correspondence and the
ransaction it covers has nothing to
do with the question of whether or not
the Riggs Bank bought and sold stocks
and bonds.
Have Tilts Over Evidence.
Tilts between counsel for both sides.
Which began the moment the court crier
gavel dropped at the opening of the trial
this morning, were the result of an inability
of counsel to agree during the
adjournment since Friday as to how
much rurther evidence should be presented
by the prosecution.
George P. Hoover of counsel for the
defense was on his feet as soon as
Justice Siddons took his seat, announcing
that at the adjournment Friday the
government had offered the bank's attorneys
a "stipulation" designed to
control the production of further documentary
evidence as to stock transactions
on the books of the defunct
brokerage Arm of Lewis Johnson & Co.
Upon this, Mr. Hoover said, there had
been no agreement, and Mr. Laskey,
the district attorney, was immediately
on his feet, objecting to a discussion
as to the contents of the "stipulation."
He declared such a discussion would
be highly improper, and particularly
did not want Mr. Hoover to read a con
cession the defense had prepared in
place of the "stipulation" which was
not agreed to.
Justice Siddons took part in a rapid
fire series of questions between counsel
and Mr. Hoover then began to formally
"move the court to require the government
to cease the introduction of further
testimony of a cumulative character?to
limit the production of documents
showing stock and bond transactions."
Justice Siddons ruled:
"Let's see what the government proposes
to do."
Mr. Hoover said:
"We will postpone our motion."
Spirited Scene Ensues.
Then ensued a spirited scene in which,
as the government placed in evidence
various entries from the books of the
bank and Lewis Johnson & Co., showing
stock and bond purchases, Frank
J. Hog an of counsel for the defense interjected
again and again the word:
"Conceded."
Entry after entry was mentioned by
Mr. Lasker Mr. Hogan snapped out
"Conceded." and then placed in evidence
for tne defense advice sheets, bills, etc..
f?JVIIIfe IIIC liamto Wl ?-UOlUilltl ?3 U1 II ic
bank for whoiii the stock and bond transactions,
he said, had been made by the
bank's officials.
It was evident as Mr. Hogan swiftly
made the concessions of the defense that
the transactions had taken place that he
was trying to hurry along the case.
Nothing was said during the early morning
about the government closing Its case
In an hour's time of which there was discussion
Friday and as 11 o'clock approached
Mr. Stanchfield of counsel for
the defense was on his feet with another
attempt to shorten the case, declaring
that since 10 o'clock thirty-eight or thirtynine
transactions had been submitted by
the government, conceded by the defense,
that much time was being taken up with
routine and that it was impossible to see
what benefit cumulative evidence could
be.
"But you d<> not concede," Mr. Laskey
remarked, "that these transactions were
by the Riggs National Bank."
William G. Johnson of counsel for the
defense cried out here:
"No! And that will never be conceded
?not until the sky falls!"

ROOSEVELT FACTOR;
G. 0. P. MEN ADMIT
Believe It Impossible, How- I
ever, for Him to Stampede
Convention.
THINK HE WOULD FIGURE I
IN SELECTION OF TICKET
Republican Leaders Say Colonel Has i
That EnH in View hv Efforts to
Increase His Prestige.
Here if? summarization of the cold
judgment of some of the prominent republican
politicians In Congress as to
the purpose and probable effect of the
latest effort in behalf of the nomination
by the regular republicans of Col.
Roosevelt.
First, they believe that it trill be impossible
for the Roosevelt enthusiasts
to stampede the regular convention for
him and they are not yet prepared to
admit that his nomination by general
consent is advisable.
Second, they think that Col. Roosevelt
realizes this, but is sanctioning the ef- .
forts in his behalf, in order to increase 1
his prestige with the regulars, magni- s
fy his power in council betwen the ?
regulars and facilitate his plan to dom- ^
inate the framing of the platform, and
be a tactpr in the selection of the ticket. a
Regular republicans are willing that he t
i should play a prominent part in both ;
| roles: indeed, he will be consulted, as a
consideration of primary political com- u
mon sense, with harmony in view. Y
Kept Before the Public. *
Tn the opinion of these cool-headed t
regulars, the Detroit speech of the colonel 1
and the Meyer-L?oeb pronunciamento Is- v
sued yesterday are efforts calculated to d
keep the colonel prominently before the ^
public and to swell his importance as a r
lactor in republican politics. s
What these regulars would give a ^
pretty to know, however, is in whose t
favor will the colonel exert his admit- a
ted influence when it comes to choosing: ^
a candidate for President?Hughes or \
Hoot, Fairbanks or Burton, Weeks or >
McCall. Cummins or Harding? It would 1
seem to be a foregone conclusion that
he will not throw it to Henry Ford. *
Mr. Hughes' friends expect him to
swing into line back of the justice when
the time is opportune. They say that
when President. Mr. Roosevelt was
largely responsible for the renomina- (
tion of Mr. Hughes for the New York i
governorship,, and that the entire rec- j
ord of Gov. Hughes is in line with pro1
gressive principles and ideals.
Other politicians, however, arguing
from analysis of human nature in general
and the colonel's temperament and
characteristics in particular, say tliey
think that the colonel will be so chaerrined
over Justice Hughes having
thrust upon him support which the colj
onel could not win by effort, he may
prefer auother. Politicians are convinced
that the colonel would gulp
hard oyer having to swallow the nomination
of Mr. Hughes.
VaaI f
JMLaj xiiiu MUVI? ^
Elihu Root, then? Personally, so far 1
as his own feelings are concerned, it is '
thought the colonel would find >lr. Root j
acceptable on a thoroughly progressive \
platform. And right here let it be
said with emphasis that the republican
platform is to be a model of progres- i
sive thought. But, as stated in The 51
Star yesterday, the colonel is entertain- jj
ing doubt whether he could control his <s
followers who ' remember the Maine"? ?
that is to say, the fact that Elihu Root .j
was chairman of the convention which t
nominated Taft and which the bull
moosers bolted. t
It is said by republicans at the Cap- v
itol competent to speak that Root t
would be acceptable outright to Utah
and Wyoming, among the western {
states; also to Kansas, and doubtless f
to other near-conservative states in '
that region if the colonel indorsed him.
The Fairbanks people have their i
lightning rods up at all four corners ;
of the political barn and on the cupo- ]
i la for the Roosevelt lightning of favor x
land indorsement. The recent talk of ,
Fairbanks for second place resulted in \
statements from the Fairbanks camp
that he wants first place or nothing.
Of course, that decision might be subject
to reconsideration if some one else
should be nominated for first place. Colonel
Comes Here Tomorrow. y
Col. Roosevelt will be In Washing- s
ton tomorrow to testify in the Riggs
Bank case. So far as known, no polit- ^
leal conferences have been arranged,
although he doubtless will be visited S
by individual progressives. d
Tn VilQ TlPtrnit snpprh th? rnlnnol tnn]/ ?
?" ? ?~ a
occasion to raise a feud with the Illi- t
nois Staats Zeitung. The colonel 1
said: (
"One of the great German newspa- r
pers?I cannot call it a German-Ameri- t
can newspaper?the Illinois StaatsZeitung,
has been engaged in active t
propaganda on behalf of both German
militarism and American pacifism. It
applauds and advocates Germany's em- 1
barking upon a career of military strength \
unconditioned by any other Consid- t
eration, and at the same time backs j
the movement of the extreme pacifists J
to keep the United States impotent for t
self-defense." Y
? . T_? IT I 8
uontraaiciea uy .newspaper. r
Whereupon the Staats-Zeitung came
back as follows: 1
"That is false. Even at the risk of I
being condemned to membership In tho
Roosevelt Ananias Club of 1S11 we must
contradict the honorable ex-President of
the United States.
"The Illinois Staats-Zeitung never indorsed
any policy that tended to 'keep
the United States impotent for self defense/
It is a vile falsehood if the colonel
really said that the Illinois Staats-Zeitung
backs any movement for that purpose. *
We print in the American?and Judge ?
Landis of Chicago is our authority for \
calling our language the American instead
of the English?language every *
Sunday the principles of the Illinois ?
Staats-Zeitung. One of the planks in thakt <
platform of principles is 'the nationalizing
of the manufacture of arms and ammuni- 4
tion/
"Perhaps the colonel sees in that principle
the 'move' to keep our country impotent.
We don't. We see in it the move
to save our taxpayers millions of graft
from the greed of rapacious and dishonest
ammunition sellers."
The New York Staats Zeitung has
come out editorially for Justice Hughes.
It declares that ^'Justice Hughes plainly
stands ahead in the list of men upon
whose candidacy the republicans and
progressives can unite." It also says
that the war situation will, play a
prominent part in the campaign, and
that Wilson will be called upon to defend
the handling of the country's foreign
policy.

is charged with murder in

witnesses who knew the.defendant at
ifferent periods of his career, many
f them to testify that his behavior in
heir presence had shown no signs of
nental abnormality. The defense has
ummoned one alienist.
Waite, clean shaven and neatly
ressed in a blue suit, was brought into

BERLIN, May 22, by wireless
to Sayville, X. Y.?Austro-Hungarian
troops have carried the
peak of Armentara ridge, the
scene of some of the heaviest;
fisrhtin? in the recently inau-1
o <r?
gurated offensive along the southern
Tyrol front. This announcement
is made in the official Austrian
report of May 21.
More than 3,000 Italians were
captured on Saturday by the Aus- i
trians, who also obtained posses- j
sion of several villages. They '
took twenty-five cannon and eight |
machine guns, the statement says.
Austrian Advance Steady.
The official Austrian reports or May v
19 and 20 show further extensive gains t
in the new offensive movement in the d
southern Tyrol, which had carried the r
Austrians on to Italian territory. The I
statement of May 20 records the expulsion
of the Italians from Col Santo p
ridge, southeast of Rovereto, and im- I
portant captures of men and guns. *
Positions captured by the Austrians in ?
the offensive movement last week include
some of the points on the Italian mo
in lino nf resistance. the Overseas I
News Agency says.
"A dispatch from Vienna gives the
text of an order issued by Lieut. Gen.
Dechaurand of the Italian army on May f
11, which was found on the colonel of a
the 64th Regiment of Italian Infantry, j
who was captured," the news agency ^
says. n
To Be Defended to Utmost. t
"In the order it is stated that the f
main line of resistance, which was to =
be defended to the utmost, was the line
from Monte Maronia to Halga, Pra Dal
Bertoldi and Sogliodaspio. The order
stated that this line would be reinforced
on both flanks 'from positions further
back, between Alpemalegna and
Baitodemarchi. The main points of
support were Capisald, Montemaronla,
Costadagra and Malga Pioyerne.
"The order stated that at Monte Coston
and Sogliodaspio resistance must
be maintained to the utmost, since the
loss of one of these positions would
endanger the whole ine. It was also
stated that Montemaronla must be held
in case of attack on the Terragnola
valley and Lain valley, since the evacuation
of this point would mean the
loss of the valleys.
"An official report from Italian headQuarters
states the Italian troops withdrew
from their advance lines to their
main positions of defense. The AustroHungarian
war Office announced the j
capture of SogliodMiplo. Coston, Costa- I
dagra and MonteiB'onia, which in the
Drder of Lieut. Gen. Dechaurand were
lesignated not as advanced positions,
but as important points on the
nain line of resistance which were tc
pe defended to the utmost."
Continues With Great Vigor.
HOME, May 22.?The Austrian attack
ontinues with the greatest vigor along
he Trentino front, especially betweer
Lhe Adige and Brenta rivers. Thest
-ivers are only about twenty miles
apart, but the fighting line is subdivided
into four sections by high mountains.
For over three months the Austriana
pad prepared for the present offensive,
is they were anxious to abandon the
iefensive attitude which they had
naintained along the whole front for
he entire year since Italy entered the
var. It is pointed out here that, as in
ill the offensives in the present war,
he assailing forces have at first an apparent
advantage, since the defenders
nust abandon their advanced fortified
ines, the object of which is to hold and
.vear down the enemy as much as possible.
While the Austrians have made ad
'am co, iiic.t 11 a v c ouaiaiucu vci ?
serious losses, especially in the Arsa
alley, near Pozzacchio fort in the Su?ana
valley and north of the high pla,eau
of Asiago.
Retire Beyond Frontier.
In the Terragnolo valley, as well as
>n the high plateau of Folgaria, the
Italians ha\'e abandoned villages in
\ustrian territory which they had occupied,
retiring beyond the former
'rentier, as these villages were merely
idvance posts held provisionally and
ecognized as likely to be untenable lh
>ase of an attack by the Austrians in
orce. As precautionary measures, the
talian military authorities ordered the
civilian population to vacate the vilages
along the frontier near Asiago.
South of Zegnatorta the Austrians made
in effort to occupy the village of
Mario which the Italians took on No,ember
12, and south of Monte Maggio
hey attacked Monte Coston, which
lominates Bercola pass, leading to Ar;iero
and Vicenza, but were repulsed
vith heavy losses.
Eieuc. Morrone, son of Gen. Paolo

Oarranza Note Due Tomorrow.
, The State Department has been ad
j vised that a new note from Gen. Car
ranza on the border situation probabl
will reach Washington today or tomor
row. It will be transmitted throug!
, Eliseo Arredondo, the Carranza ambas
, sador. Special Agent Rodgers at Mex
1 ico City has been unable as yet to re
port what phase of the situation ha
called forth the new communication.
Mr. Rodgers has advised the Stab
Department that Carranza officials ii
Mexico City feel the border situation i
less critical. Some officials believe i
possible that the new note deals witl
the Glenn Springs raid. Represents
tions were made by the State Depart
ment at that time which have not beei
answered by Gen. Carranza. Mr. Rod
gers recently was instructed to call th
attention of the Carranza governmen
to the facts.
May Refer to Second Expedition.
Tt is probable that the new Americai
expedition sent over the line after th
raid may be the cause of the cominj
note. Secretary Baker said today tha
the Scott-Obregon understanding in n<
way limited the pursuit of bandits.
Border reDorts insist that Col. Sible\
commanding the new expedition, is a!
ready withdrawing his forces to thi
American side, but Secretary Bake
reiterated today that Gen. Funston ha<
not so advised the War Department
He added, however, that the questioi
was wholly in Gen. Funston's hands.
