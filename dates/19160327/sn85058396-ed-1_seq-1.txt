Athens, March 26, 9 a. m., via Paris,
Mnrch 27, 12:15 a. m. Dispatches
from Saloniki say that tho frontier
actions which had hitherto been con
sidered borely as trying out operations
on the part of tho Bulgarians and Ger
mans, are now assuming the character
of a genoral attack against tho ad
vanced lino of tho allies. Consider
able vigor is being displayed and
heivy artillery is being employed on
both sides. It Is said that in both
military and diplomatic circles of the
Teutonic allies thero Is a belief that
tho long prophesied effort to drlvo

It Is pointed out that theso circles,
In Athens at least, are not In a posi

entente circles here, while the im
portance of tho Increasing activity of

minimized, thero Is a general convic
tion that they do not seriously Intend

Found on the Sussex.
U. S. GATHERING PROOF
President Urges Speedy Gath
ering of Facts Regarding
Sinking of the Sussex
and Englishman.
Washington, March 27. It was stat
ed authoritatively here today that
should it be shown that a German
submarine attacked the Sussex, Ger
many would disavow the act, offer re
paration, punish the submarine com
mander and satisfy the United States
that the act was In violation of In
structions. It was also stated authoritatively
that the German ambassador, Count
von Bernstorff, Was mainly respon
sible for the recent retirement of
Grand Admiral von Tlrpltz, who Is
said to have been eliminated because
of his views on submarine warfare
after Count von Bernstorff had made
certain recommendations to the Im
perial chancellor, von Bethmann-Holl-wen.
According to Information here the
ambassador was advised that Admiral
von Tlrpltz proposed to conduct a re
lentless submarine campaign against
all shipping to British port and askod
what, In his opinion, would be the ef
fect of such a campaign upon neutral
nations, particularly the United
The ambassador's reply Is said to
have been an important factor In the
retirement of the admiral.
Washington, March 27. Consular
-Agent"WhItmari at Boulogne reported
today that he was Informed by French
officials that a pleco of bronze, re
sembling a part of a torpedo, had been
found on the channel liner Sussex.
Stato department officials said to
day they hnd no Information that any
other than German submarines were
operating In the vicinity in which tho
Sussex was attacked. All agents In
the vicinity were being urged today
to gather conclusive evidence from
all possible agencies.
Definite Information Awaited.
Washington, March 27. Definite in
formation regarding the sinking of
tho steamship Englishman and the
damaging by explosion of the channel
steamer Sussex were anxiously await
ed by President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing today.
If It Is established that either of the
vessels was torpedoed by a Gorman
submarlno. the United States would
regard the act as a most flagrant vio
lation of the rights of humanity, the
principles of International law and of
assurances given by Germany regard
ing the conduct of submarine warfare.
Situation Is Grave.
Washington, March 27. American
officials view the submarine situation
as taking on aspects of much gravity.
The possibility of breaking off diplo
matic relations with Germany is again
being discussed as one of the eventu
alities that is expected to follow if
shown that the steamers Sussex and
Englishman were victims of submar
ines. Officials say they can come to no
conclusion before they have addition
al Information but thero Is an under
current of uneasiness over the possi
bility that German submarines have
renewed their activities against pas
senger carrying steamship in violation
of tho assurances given to tho United
Wilson to Consult Congress.
The impression was general that, if
it should bo established that the ships
were victims of submarines and Presi
dent Wilson decided to tako action, ho
first would consult conefress.
American consular officers and the
embassies In Franco and England are
being urged to gather evidence of a
definite and legal sort and, when this
is at hand, President Wilson and Sec
retary Lansing will determlno what
tho next step will bo.
Chairman Stono of the foreign re
lations' committee conferred during
the day with President Wilson and tho
president nlso was In communication
with Secretary Lansing and urged
speedy gathering of facts rogardlng
tho Sussex and Englishman.
Senators and representatives who
called at the White Houso reflected
the view tha the situation was ser
ious. American In Serious Condition.
London, March 27, 12:05 p. m- 0I

Sussex who are in a hospital at Dover,
only one, George Crocker, of Fitch

His skull was fractured by a falling

but are not seriously injured.
No Americans Lost.
Paris, March 27, 12:15 p. Tn. De
tailed information 'gathered by the
American embassy here indicates
that no American lives were lost on
the Sussex.
All the Americans whose names
were on the passenger list have now
been accounted for, tho embassy
states. It Is possible, however, that
there may have among tho passen

GEN. PERSHING
HAS NEW BASE
Message by Aeroplane Tells of
Changes Made and Remark
able Work Done in
Two Weeks.
Field Headquarters, American Ex
peditionary Force, Colonla Dublan,
March 2G, by Aeroplane to Columbus,
N. M., March 27. General Pershing
announced last night the establish
ment of a new base In the pursuit of
Villa. Tho second base Is much near
er the location where the bandit Is re
ported In precipitate retreat than the
old base at field headquarters.
Tho headquarters, It is presumed,
will be maintained as an important
link in tho supply station system, the
chain of bases forming a strong mili
tary line, readily defensible, reaching
a distance into the interior of Mexico
which is considered remarkable con
sidering the fact that the army has
had less than two weeks to bridge
deserts, mountains and many miles
of barren lands without the benefit
of any railroad communication.
Abilltv of American Cavalry.
Horses, mules and automobiles have
done tho work and success thus far
has been attained by tho ability of the
American cavalry to travel fast and
far on light rations, accustoming
themselves as they travel, not only to
a seml-natlve diet, but also to diffi
cult climatic conditions.
Several cavalry organizations have
been out for considerably more than
a week after a start made on a little
beef, salt, coffee and rice or beans.
Not a word of complaint has corao
back from these troopers.
Villa Bandits Outdone.
Not a sign has been received at
headquarters that they have anywhere
faltered. Reports here give good
cause for belief that thus far the
American troopers havo proven them
selves the superiors in speed and en
durance over the famous Villa ban
dits. There is, moreover, confidence hero
that the cavalry will continue its
good work for at least two or threo
weeks) by which time it is possible
that new organizations can bo thrown
Into the chase.
Officers Proud of Men.
The headquarters officers are all
tho more proud of the cavalry's rec
ord, because they began the most re
cent phase of the chase after one ot
tho longest and hardest rides an
American cavalry division has ever
made.
The men still In camp here express
growing Impatience to mount and
start southward Into the altitudes
where they know the cold Is bltterv
and the shelter on campaign duty is
anything but comfortable.
EN SCHOOL HOUSES
10 BE ERECTED IN
JREGOUHTY
The county board of education to
day determined to build a three-room
schoolhouso at Warren and a four
room school building at Burch Creek.
A heating plant will be placed in the
North Ogden school.
Raising the salaries of teachers this
year will necessitate tho placing of
about 3000 more money in the teach
ers' fund for tho ensuing year.

Field Headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces, 'i'II
Colonia Dublan, Chihuahua, Mexico, March 26. (By aero- ,) j
plane to Columbus, N. M., March 27. Evidence that Pancho ! 1)
Villa is preparing to resist the American pursuing columns and ' I
that the Mexican people are not as yet rallying to him, has been i j jlj
collected by the officers and the scouts of the American j ' 111;
troops. '
The officers, who havo ridden over
the various fronts now maintained In
tho stato of Guerrero where Villa fled
when the United States expedition
crossed tho border, havo discovered
numerous significant indications that
Villa miscalculated completely when
he forecast that his Columbus raid,
by drawing an army into Mexico,
would cause a general uprising against
Americans and especially one In his
favor.
Villa Trying to Force Recruits.
Tho status ot the chaso today is
that Villa Is retiring continually south
ward, trying hard to force recruits Into
his ranks,' his men reeling under tho
pinch of hunger and hoping for an
early arrival of summer to shield them
against the cold of tho mountains,
where they havo retreated somewhere
south of Namlquipa, in central west
ern Chihuahua, probably In the Guer
rero dlstrlcL
The one question of overshadowing
Importance now being asked by tho
officers In tho fidld is:
"Will Villa continue to prepare for
resistance?"
Americans Hoping for Resltance.
It is frankly hoped that he will, for
that Is considered the best chance,
barring a lucky capture through
treachery of Villa's own men, of bring
ing the American expedition to an
early successful conclusion. If Vlllt
refuses to make any resistance at all,
the men who have been over tho
ground here beliove It may require
months, at least, to crush him.
An officer, who has been through
many villages where Villa had
passed, within a week, found that to
all appearances tho bandit had failed
to Inflame sentiment against the
Americans.
People In Complete Ignorance.
"These rural people," said this of
ficer, "are In complete Ignorance of
any reliable facts about tho nature of
tho American expedition. They have
been told that the Americans are an
Invading army, a dangerous enemy;
thnt- tliov iniiQf flfrhf fnr fhnlr llvv
But, although those whom I saw
seemed to bo a very credulous people,
they appeared to be waiting with
some suspicion it is true but never
theless waiting before making up their
minds. ""- .
v "This waiting I took to be a hopeful
sign. It was like going into Indian
villages where tho Inhabitants regard,
one with open suspicion but aro ready
to be friendly, provided they think
our mission Is friendly. That, I think,
is the attitude of tho people toward
us In many of the places where Villa
hoped for recruits."
Villa Seizes Men and Boyo.
For two weeks the roports along
Villa's trail show he has seized many
of the young men and boys ofsmall
' towns and the hardiest aro forced as
recruits Into his band.
His custom has been either himself,
or through one of his lieutenants, to
line up most of tho malo population
for Inspection. The best physical
specimens have been pulled out of line
and told roughly that they were hon
ored above tho others, becauso they
would become "Villa's men."
In tho Casas Grandes region, at
Galaena and at El Vallo, Villa se
cured fully half a hundred men by
this method, moro than enough to
make up for the wounded carried from
the Columbus fight, which ho dropped
In those sections. The disappearance
of some of tho Carranza garrison at
Namlquipa, and subsequent roports
that theso men had Joined Villa, was
not taken at American headquarters
as an Indication of serious trouble.
Carranza Troops Co-operate With
Good Will.
Personal Investigation In the field
indicate to tho American officers, they
said, that tho constitutionalist troops
were co-operating with good will.
Occasional defections of Mexican
troops, In view ot the unsettled poli
tical condition in this republic, havo
been expected. Thero has ibeen no
sign of a break reported hero on tho
part of any of tho constitutionalist
army officers with whom tho Ameri
can forces have been in actual co
operation. All of them appear to bo
following orders from General Gutler.
rez, military governor of Chihuahua,
to close in on Villa from all sides.
Army Using Mexican Wires.
The American army forces havo
been allowed the privilege of UBlng
the Mexican telegraph wires between
Madeira and Juarezit was annouue-
I lilt
ed hero today by General Gavlra, the j ;
Carranza commander at Juarez. All 4 11
communications, however, are cen- ; JJIJ1

za commander at Madeira. M ill
General Gavira said that General W '
3ertani reported no news from the U j
front but that he was working In per- n
feet accord with General Pershing. ill ' j
This statement was taken to mean m j I
hero that American troops must bo 11 j
using tho lines ot the Mexico North- ttl 'II
western railroad to Maderla. Per- a j
sons who know the country well say If
there Is no possible means, other than S II II

This information coming from army II
officers at the front, confirms roports J I
brought here by American travelers j
from the CaBas Grandes district last l II
Saturday that Villa had escaped M
through the lines of Carranzlsta ? j
troops. Mexican Consul Garcia does ;
not credit the reports that tho Car- ij Jl
ranza forces furnished no real oppo- i J j
sition to Villa and permitted the ban- J llll
dit to escape. jjl
Villa scattered his command In hit J ,1 III
fllpht southward and at one time, 11 i lilt
vas learned today, led only a small !
force ot fifteen or twenty men. The
army censor at Columbus haB permit- tl llll
ted the Information to pasB that Villa 1 llll
increased his command at El Valle by W II
"forcing thlrty-flvo young men and .
bovs to accompany him. Military '
jnen here say this Indicates that Villa

tion to move a larger body of men
without fear of capturo.
Brigadier-General Pershing has let f
it be known that it will tako months . I
to capture Villa. ' j1
Returning American refugees and !.

Villa will nover be taken. The na- J Ijjl
