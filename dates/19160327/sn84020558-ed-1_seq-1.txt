SAN ANTONIO, Texas, March 26.
Six persons lost their lives early to
day in the burning of the fashionable
Pan Antonio Country club, five of the
victims were guests at the club, which
was the scene last night of several
week-end parties, bringing together a
large number of persons prominent In
social and business circles of the
southwest.
The dead are:
Mrs. and Mr. J. B. Walthall. San
Antonio.
Judge J. E. Webb, San Antonio.
Homes Jones, San Antonio.
Mrs. Maeo Stewart, Galveston.
Helen Cockrell, maid at the club.
The fire had its origin in a collec
tion of paint stored in the basement
of the three story frame club house.
It spread quickly to a stairway lead
Ing to the first floor and rapidly com
municated to the other two floors
Above. About fifteen guest asleep in
the building had narrow escapes,
many jumping from the second story
windows, so quick was the spread of
the flames.
Mrs. Stewart who was spending her
first night at the club as the guest
of Mrs. Cora Ogden, had escaped from
the burning building but with Homer
Jones started back to- rescue Judge
Webb, whose hearing was affected and
who they feared, would not hear the
nlaim. The three were caught in
the dense smoke and went to their
death together.
James Walthall, 45 years old, was
formerly attorney general of Texas.
His wife was a bride of twelve
months, formerly. Miss Mary Carson
of Indianapolis, Ind.
Judge Weob was a prominent mem
ber of the bar.
Mrs. Stewart was the wife of Maco
Stewart, president of the Title Guar
anty company of Texas, whose home
was in Galveston. She came here for
a week's visit with friends.
The flames were discovered by the
steward of the club, who went into
the grill shortly after a number of
guests had left the first floor for
their apartments upstairs. The stew
ard attempted to quench the flames
with fire extinguishers. This proved
insufficient, so he summoned the
guests who still were awake and who
plded In alarming the others in the
building.
A number of the guests at the club
escapeil by jumping from the veranda
roof.
The club ond its contents were val
ued at $45,000 with $35,000 Insurance.
The six charred bodies, burned be
yond recognition, were taken from the
ruins today, identification having been
established by dentistry work and
jewelry worn by the victims.
Search for bodies began at dawn.
The -building burned like tinder and
was consumed in less than an hour.

Three Steamers Are Sunk;
Crew of One May Be Lost

MARSEILLES. March , 26. The
British liner Minneapolis was sunk in
the Mediterranean last Wednesday by
a submarine, according to Captain
Bibby of the British steamer Leices
tershire, which has arrived here from
Rangoon.
Captain Bibby reports that while
in the Mediterranean last Wednes
day, he received a wireless call for
help from the Minneapolis which said
that the steamer had Just been tor
pedoed and was sinking.
The Leicestershire went at full
speed to the assistance of the Min
neapolis, but arrived too late, the
vessel having sunk. The fate of the
crew was not known to Captain
fiibby. .
The Minneapolis was a steamer of
13.543 tons gross. She was built in
1900 at Belfast and was owned by
the Atlantic Transport Company.
Late shipping records do not give
the movements of the vessel which
probably was in the British govern

PARIS, March .26., (midnight)
"There is no matter of doubt whatever
that the Channel steamship Sussex
was torpedoed without warning," says
an official statement issued here to
night, based on affidavits made by j
American survivors.
John Hurley. Albany, N. Y, a press
assossiation correspondent, makes the
following statement:
"On Friday about 3 o'clock in the af
ternoon, while a dozen Americans were
watching from the bridge a great ex
plosion occurred in the fore part of
the vessel without warning and three
Americans, at least, saw the passing of
the torpedo."
W. J. Culbertson says that he saw
Miss Baldwin on the deck, wounded in
the head. Samuel Bemis of Harvard
University said the explosion occurred
without the slightest warning and that
many persons were thrown into the
sea; that some were killed and some
wounded; that he saw bodies on the
bridge of the Sussex and that while
being rescued, he saw two persons
drown.
These depositions are confirmed by
the American men and American wo
men who took passage aboard the Sus
sex and whose names follow:
John Hurley, Albany, N. Y.; Mrs. Lil
lian Harde, New York; Mrs. Clarence
Handy side, New York; Miss Gertrude

WASHINGTON, March 26. Official
information upon which President Wil
son will decide whether the sinking of
the Steamship Englishman and the
damaging by an explosion of the Chan
nel Steamer Sussex were the results of
acts of violation of international law,
is being gathered from every avail
able source by consular representatives
of the United States in England and
France. Tangible evidence of some
kind tonight momentarily was expect

Dispatches already received indicate
that several Americans were injured or
killed on the Sussex in the disaster.
Four American citizens who were
aboard the Englishman and who were
said in dispatches yesterday not to be

Only one dispatch of importance con
cerning the explosion which damaged
the Sussex was received by the state
department during the day. This con
tained an affidavit made in London at
the American embassy by two Ameri
can survivors, Edward S. Huxley and
Francis E. Drake, of New York. Both
swore that the explosion occurred
"without the slightest warning" and
they credited the commander of the

which hovered near the Sussex after
the explosion, and which in response
to signals for assistance from the chan

strange vessel, which apparently dis
regarded all the traditions, and law of

dispatches as being missing or injured

dated today in Boulogne, received here
tonight from Professor Baldwin by J.
A. Sterrett, a son-in-law. Mr. Ster
rett, however, accepted as true press
and official state department dispatch
es containing information that Miss
Baldwin had been seriously injured.
He had cabled to his father-in-law
for additional information.
Information regarding the Sussex,
which had been received tonight did
not, high administration officials say,
convince them that the vessel was the
victim of submarine attack. One mem
ber of the cabinet, who discussed the
situation with the president said that
reports at hand were by no means con
clusive. The administration, while fully re
alizing the possibilities of the situation,
should the indication in press dis
patches be borne out in the official re
ports, will take no decisive action un
less proof positive is forthcoming. The
course of the United States will be de
cided upon by official reports from its
own officers.
Should either the Sussex or the Eng
lishman have been torpedoed the Unit
ed States would consider the act to be
a most flagrant violntion of the rights
of humanity, the principles of interna
tional law and the broad assurances
regarding the conduct of submarine
warfare which have been given by the
German government There is no evi
dence, or even a suggestion, that either
of the ships was armed, so no defense
could be offered on that score.
In this connection it is probable that

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, March 26. Three British
aeroplanes -which totfk part in a raid
on German airship sheds in Schlesvvig
and Holstein yesterday, are missing.
Two German patrol vessels were
sunk and a British destroyer is be
lieved to have been lost.
The following official statement
was issued tonight:
"An attack by British seaplanes
was delivered yesterday morning on
German airships sheds in Schleswig
Holetein, eastward of the Island of
Sylt. The seaplanes were convoyed
to their rendezvous close to the Ger
man coast by an escorting force of
light cruisers and destroyers under
Commodore Tyswhitt. '
"Three of the seaplanes which took
part in the attack are missing. The
destroyer Medusa was in collision
with the destroyer Lavrock and it is
feared that in the stormy weather
which prevailed last night the Medusa
may have been lost, but no misgiv
ings are felt as to the safety of the
crew. Two German armed patrol ves
sels were sunk by our destroyers.
"No detailed report has yet been
received but from Danish press dis
patches it would appear that this
operation, which was carried out
within the enemy's waters, accomp
lished its object."
The Lavrock, 260 feet long, was
built Ifi 1914 and displaced 96D tons.
She was armed with three four-inch
guns and two torpedo tubes. Her
normal complement was 100 men. The
latest available British navy records
give no destroyer Medusa.
Dispatches from Esbjorg. Denmark,
to the Berlingske Tidende says Reu

norls a great naval battle between the
German and British fleets some three

morning for an attack against the
German aeronautic establishments in
northern Schlesvvig.
'Not less than three of them, among

SAN ANTONIO, March 20. Francis
co Villa has escaped from the Mexican
troops that had checked him near
Namiquipa and three columns of
American cavalry are pursuing him.
The American troops are almost 250

General Funston forwarded the re

From El Valle another line is being

EL PASO, March 26. Interest in the
Mexican situation shifted today, tem
porarily, at least from Northern Chi
huahua to Durango and Coahuila,
where the Villaistas appear to be gath
ering strength to such an extent that
Torreon is seflously threatened.
There has been no direct news from
Torreon received here for two days, but
dispatches from Monterey report an
extremely grave situation. The re
maining women and children of the
American colony at Torreon, sent out
of that city by the British vice consul,
Patrick O'Hea who nas taken charge
of American interests following the de
parture of the United States consul,
have arrived at Monterey. ,
There were four in number and
brought a story of conditions of anar
chy existing in the district between
Torreon and Monterey. A box car was
all the accommodation they could get
and almost throughout the entire jour
ney they were subjected to a running
fire from bands of mounted Villistas,
who raced alongside the train exchang

supplied by General Ignacio Ramos.
The women and children crouched be
tween a double barricade of trunks
which protected them from the bullets

March 26. (Wireless to Columbus, N,

pursuing Villa, today complimented
the stamina and the spirit of the
troops comprising the expeditionary
force. General Pershing made the

the tent over which have swept sting
ing dust storms, bitter sleet and burn

States troops in the field have faced

No similar body of any army would
have arrived in better condition under
the circumstances, he said. The ser
vice encountered by the command in
cluded some excedingly long marches
by the cavalry and wide stretches of
desert covered by the infantry and
artillery.
The march of concentration at the
first base Is not believed here to have
been equalled by any command of
this size in recent years. And through
it all the morale of the troops has
been excellent. The spirit of the com
mand is shown by the eagerness
which the men have manifested in
pushing forward through the heat of

storms and the bitter cold of moun

Three aeroplanes are at El Valle and
will be used in scouting as in the high
winds that have been sweeping that
part of Mexico for almost a week sub
sided which according to General Per
shing have made effective assistance
by them impossible. Of the eight ma
chines that went into Mexico two are
still out of commission. They were
damaged in the flights from Columbus
to Casas Grandes.
Details of the operations about
Namiquipa that concluded with the
escape of Villa were not revealed but
there is little reason to believe that
lie was even weakened by the fighting
directed against him by the de facto
government troops. Reports last week
from Mexican sources indicated that he
had been severely defeated. No Amer
icans were engaged, and the fact that
Villa made his way through what was
described as an encircling line of Mex
ican troops was taken to indicate that
he was the victor.
Unless fresh Mexican forces are sent
to meet Villa troops there are no rea
sons why he should not make his way
uninterrupted into the mountains of
the Guerrero district towards which he
appears to be moving.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
COLUMBUS, N. M., March 26. A
speedy termination of the American
expedition into Mexico is not looked
for by General J. J. Pershing, com
manding the forces in the field, ac
cording to advices received here to
day. It was asserted that, following a
staff conference. General Pershing
announced that the people of the
United States should not place too
much confidence in reports that Fran
cisco Villa, the factional leader,
whose command attacked this town
several weeks ago, has been bottled
up, either by the American forces, or
hy Mexican troops. The nature of
the country in the vicinity of Nam
iquipa, where Villa is supposed to be,
it was pointed out, renders it diffi
cult for any force to surround ef
fectually a small band, in the moun
tain passes and almost imperceptible
trails offering a means of escape.
While it was understood that Gen
eral Pershing does not attempt to
predict the length of time Ameri
can troops may be in Mexican terri
tory it was intimated that the per
iod may extend into months.
Oiher reports also received today
from unofficial sources indicated that
with (deleted) troops in the field,
American military authorities believ
ed a sufficient number of men of all
arms of the service have been con
centrated at La Ascenscion, Casas
Grandes, Colonia Dublan. and other
American field points to meet the ex
igencies of any emergency that may
arise. Several thousand negro in
fantrymen and two squadrons of
cavalry, have arrived here from Forts
D. A. Russell, Wyo.; Leavenworth,
Kansas, and Sheridan, 111. The cav
alrymen will assist in the border pa
trol and the infantry will garrison
Columbus.
Captain Richmond Smith, in com
mand at Boca Grandes, reported by
wireless that his men had found and
buried the body of Cook O'Neill, who
was murdered by Villa's company on
its way to attack Columbus.

and forced them to accompany his col
umn. Half of the constitutionalist gar
rison at Namiquipa, about sixty miles
south of here, has disappeared and it is
suspected that some of them, at least,
also have joined Villa.
Utmost haste is being made in the
flight toward the mountains which
Villa is nearing rapidly, neither men
nor horses being spared. II is known
that he is practically without supplies
and ammunition and it is reported that
he is attempting to reach a neighbor
hood where he has ammunition cached
in three places.
Peons in the district through which
he has passed recently say that his men
are ravenously hungry and are prac
tically in a state of starvation. Dead
ana dying horses discarded in the
flight are found almost daily by the
American troops, eight being discov
ered today.
The haste which the bandit is mak
ing in his flight would indicate that
the American forces are close on his
heels, but General J. J. Pershing, expe
ditionary commander, who returned to
day from a two days' inspection trip of
troops in the field, says that reports
that Villa is surrounded are premature.

Durango City was isloated from the
outside world for several days last
