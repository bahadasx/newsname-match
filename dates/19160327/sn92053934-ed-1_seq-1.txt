dence that Pancho Villa is

that the Mexican people are
not as yet rallying to him,
has been collected by the of

Ing columns of American cavalry
are seeking today to entrap

the mountainous district south of

barred, squadrons of caTairy and

BANDIT CHASE A RACE.
Pursuit of Francisco Villa had de
veloped today into a race between cav
alrymen of the United States and the
fleeing bandits mounted on the won
derful Mexican ponies.
According to dispatches from the
front, Villa has broken through the
Carranzistas' line and is fleeing
southward with the American troop
ers straining every nerve to catch him
before he reaches the mountain
wastes in the Guerrero district.
The one hope of a speedy termina
tion to the chase is that the flight of
the bandits will be checked by star
vation and the exhaustion of their
ponies. It la known that Villa is al
most destitute of both supplies and
ammunition and the dead and dying
horses found along his trail give mute
but eloquent testimony to his desper
ate haste and need.
Once safely in the midst of the
Sierra Tarahumares the task of run
ning the bandit to his lair will have
become one of tremendous difficulty.
This country is inhabited by the
Tarahumare Indians, who according to
American residents of this district,
have some of the finest and worst
qualities of any of the Mexican abor
igines. If you treat them fairly they
will stand by you to the last gasp.
Their loyalty to their friends is al
most equal to that of a dog. The
country in which they live is one of
the wildest on earth. The peaks of
the Sierras rise in a confused Jumble
with no roads and only the vaguest
of trails. Here and there are little
valleys in which the Tarahumares
farm but they are hidden away at the
entrance by mighty canyons and are
difficult to discover.
It is among these people, among
whom his early days ai a bandit were
passed, it is believed.that Villa hopes
to take refuge. He is said to have
many friends among them.
(arranza Soldiers Revolt?

MEXICANS WON BY
AMERICAN DOLLAR
People of Chihuahua District Show
Friendliness at Willingness of
Troopers to "Spend."
Columbus, N. M., March 27. The
American dollar rapidly is finding a
place in the hearts, of the people of
northern Chihuahua, according to sol
diers and civilians arriving at the bor
der today from General J. J. Persh
ing's headquarters. The people of the
districts through which the American
troops passed at first were coldly
friendly but when they found that the
ericans- did not commandeer their
live stock and food supplies their cour
tesy and friendliness increased.
The price, too, increased when the
inhabitants found that the Americans
had money and were willing to spend
it to satisfy his wants. An example
cited is that eggs were readily pur
chasable for 10 cents a dozen by the
first troops passing through La Ascen
cion, but by yesterday the price paid
reached 50 cents a dozen and showed
signs of rising further.
Lieutenant H. A. Dargue of the aero
plane corps left here early today on
the first trip from Columbus to Casas

aero dispatch line.

possibility that German subma
