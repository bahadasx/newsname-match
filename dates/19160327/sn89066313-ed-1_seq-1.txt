town is to help the students readjust
their thoughts on religious problems.
"I will say for the University of
Missouri that there is more religioiib
interest hero than in any other uni

students have been very faithful in
their obligations to the church here.
Although I am glad to offer my serv
ices to a larger field, I leave Colum
bia and my many friends here with
regret"

BEWARE OP FALSE FOKECASTERS
l'. S. Iliiri'iiu Is Authorized Agency to
.Make Weather Predictions.
A warning against false weather
forecasters was received today by
George Recder, Columbia weather
man, from C. V. Marvin, chief of the
United States Weather Bureau in
Washington. The bulletin tells the
public to bet.src of such systems of
forecasting tht weather as the study
of sun-spots, planetary and astrologi
cal combinations and the like.
Mr. Marvin declares that the United
States Weather Bureau is the only
agency authorized by the Government
to collect meteorological observations
and to make and issue weather fore
casts and warnings throughout the
country.
Mr. Hecder says that, beginning this
afternoon, the weather will be clear
and warmer. The light snowfall and
rain this morning, he said, was only
temporary, as there is a low-pressure
area passing across the center of the
country from Seattle to New York.
The latest snowfall last spring oc
curred March 22, when one .1 of an
inch was recorded by the local bu
reau. The latest snowfall on record
in Columbia was on April 30, 11)03.
The latest fall of snow recorded for
the whole state was on May 15, 1907,
at Gallatin.
Pairport, Do Kalb County, recorded
eight inches of snow on May 3, 1907.
Snow fell all day, April 7, 1837, in
St. Charles and Warren counties, cov
ering the ground two and one half
feet deep. In 1S57, several inches of
snow lay on the ground at Fayette
from April 17 until April 20.
ADOPTS .NEW GRADING SYSTEM
Stephens College Uses Self-Readim:
Curie for Eacli Student.
A new grading system lias been
adopted at Stephens College. For each
student a curve is laid out, the co
ordinates of whicli are time and class
standing. It works on much the same
principle as a self-reading ther
mometer. The teacher can look at a
student's grade-curve and tell what
her class standing lias been at any
time since the beginning of the se
mester.
The paper is marked off in squares.
The middle parallel line is called tho
M line, the space above and below lie
inir cn'uallv diiided for grades above
and below the M standing. The M
line is divided into equal spaces, each
of which denotes two week's time.
At the end of every two weeks the
co-ordinates arc plotted. Ecach stu
dent's curve starts from the M line. At
the end of the semester the average
grade will be represented by the aver
age height of the co-ordinates.

SHOW YOUR WARES TONIGHT
"Oil, little kids,' my pretty kids, be
thankful as you may that you get jour
education in a peaceful scrt of way."
While times have changed somewhat
since Bret Harte wrote of how Three
fingered Jack went down in tho. spelt
in' bee at Angel's "with Webster on
iiis chest and Worcester in his brain,"
still human hearts don't change so
much, and there will be some tragic
finishes at Stephens College tonight
when the annual spelling match takes
place.
Already the air is thick with twit
terings to the effect that it is bad form
to send out invitations to the best
spellers, and E. M. Watson, captain
on one side, lias been frantically using
the telephone all day in an efrort to
offset the work of Captain J. X.
rtclciier's engraved cards, whL'li Mr
Watson believes have been sent out to
the well-known spellers.

CO-OP HASTENS TO "PREPARE"
Attempted Burglary Creates Favor for J
'Adequate Defense."
There is still no clew to the Identity
of the masked man who entered the
Co-operative Store early Saturday
morning and exchanged revolver shots
with II. P. Saunders, according to B. J.
Carl, assistant manager. The cuff but
ton, which was found after the burglar
had made his exit probably was not the
intruder's property, Mr. Carl said, as it
was picked up some distance from
where tho man stood, when he fired.
The clerks who sleep in the store
have become strong advocates of pre
paredness since Friday night. Alfonso
Johnson, manager of the store, has de
cided to have heavy iron bars placed
over the windows and James B.
Ilowat, a clerk, bought a revolver as
soon as he could get uptown Saturday
morning. He intends to sleep with it
under his pillow.
