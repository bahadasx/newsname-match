and a telegram trom Professor Baldwin s brother, Cyrus H. Baldwin,
at Columbia, S. C, stated lie had received a cablegram that Miss
Baldwin was in a London hospital.
The family was inclined to believe that Miss Baldwin had been
injured, as the cablegram "All safe" might be considered merely an
assurance that the three Baldwins had escaped with their lives.
