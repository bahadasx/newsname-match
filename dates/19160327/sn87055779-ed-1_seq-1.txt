The hulk of the evidence points
to a torpedo in each instance. Hut

Noted Criminal Confesses
Muessel Murder But His
Story is Nailed as a Lie
Christ Fox, notorious car robber
ami burglar, one time member of
the Iake Shore gang, was arrested
for vagrancy several days ago at
Oelwein. Ia., ami held in the jail
there. Apparently he did not like
the (ornhusking atmosphere of the
Oelwein jail so he confessed to the
authorities that he was implicated
in the Muessel-Chrobot murders,
which took place at the .Muessel
Hrevving Co., on the evening of Dec.
30, 1915.
This confession took place on last
Wednesday. Chief John II. Kuespert
was notified by J. F. Chivington,
chief of thi Oelwein police depart
ment, and immediately hurried to
the Iowa town. When the chief of
detectives heard Fox's story he was
inclined to disbelieve it but brought
the man back to South F.end. After
further questioning Fox finally ad
mitted that he was lying and that
he had nothing whatever to do with
the case. In fact he was in the
Michigan City prison at the time the
double murder took place, having
been released from there on March
L 1 ü 1 6 .
In his "confession" to the Oelwein
police. Fox said that he was the
"outside" man in the brewery holdup
and murders. The men who did the
killing, he asserted, were Frank
Cillen and Jack Itaski. two former
pals. The weak link in his story
was that he declared he got Jl?s as
his share of the spoils while as a
matter of fact but a few dollars was
secured by the bandit-slayers.
Ilaski Held 1 1 Days.
Jack Kaski was arrested shortly
after the double murder took place
and held In jail here for 4 1 days.
Although the police here had some
evidence against the man they were
unable to connect him directly with
the affair and he was finally re
leased. Frank Oillen. better known
as "Kanush." has never ?een lo
cated. It was reported shortly after
the murders that "Kanush" was seen
in South Pond and near the Muessel
brewing plant on the night of the
tragedy and the police have been
seeking him ever since.
In making his "confession" to the
Oelwein police, Fox explained he was
afraid Paski and lillen would be

International New Service:
SAN ANTONIO, Texas. March 2 7.
American troops are pressing
close upon the heels of Francisco
Villa and his fleeing bandits, 24 0
miles south of the bonier. Maj.
Gen, Funston said today:
"I would not be surpiised to hear
at any time that our men had been
in contact with Villistaa."
The United States tr( ops are op
erating in six columns. Three of
these are being directed by Col.
Dodd. The three others are sup
porting columns from the forces
that Col. Slocum led into Mexico.
(Jen. Pershing is at held headquar
ters, but is in close touch with the
rapidly moving troops.
The main base of thi Americans
in Mexico is at t'asas (Jrandes. The
chief outpost base is at FI Valle. All
the lines of communication are
heavily guarded.
Hen. Pershing in his repoits to
headquarters here has continued the
leports that Villa succeeded in es
caping from the "ring of steel"
which the CarranziFtas boasted had
been drawn about the elusive bandit
leader. Villa Is now said to be in
San Heroniino canyon. south of
Onerrero. Rffective -operations in
this region will be very difficult for
the Americans.
Conyoii i,"o Miles Long.
The canyon is about 0 miles
long. It has preciptious sides that
cannot be scaled and the few paths
leading to the wooded heights above
are known to only few. even Mex
icans. It was here that for years
Villa defied the Mexican regulars
sent by Pres't IMaz to apprehend
him.
Hen. Funston was without any of
ficial confirmation today of reports
that a body of Mexicans had attack
ed an American detachment near El
Valle 'ast Friday and that six Fnited
States soldiers had been wounded.
Kl Paso reports intimate d thr-t Car
lanzista soldiers took part in the
attack. (Jen. Funston refused to dis
cuss these rumors.
(Jen. Funston refused also to in
timate what secret information as
to the conditions in Mexico had been
given him in (Jen. Pershing's report.
This part of Pershing's dispatch
was forwarded to Washington, but
was deleted from the account given
to the 'newspaper coi respondents
here.
iH'rlines to Tell of I lotion.
"What was delelcd from Gen.
Pershing's report?" Hen. Funston
was asked today.
"I decline to discus It," was his
reply.
"What about the Carranzistas re
fusal to cooperate with the Amer
ican troops':"' the generil was then
asked.
"That is what I deleted." was
Funst on's answer.
Rorder reports persist in predict
ing that the Carranzistas will ulti
mately cast their lot with Villa
The American military authorities
minimize these reports and attribute
them to certain interests which they
