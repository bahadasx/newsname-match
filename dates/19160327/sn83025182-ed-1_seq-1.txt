PAiRJS, March 87.—Germany has
been making desperate efforts to de
tach Italy from the ranks of the al
lies. This was learned by the United
Press today when the super-war coun
cil of the allies, one of the most im
portant conferences In history, met for
its first session at the foreign offlco
today.
The information came from a most
reliable Italian source. The Germans,
It was learned, planned by shrewd
propaganda and by a triumph at Ver
dun to create such dissatisfaction in
Italy that the government would re
consider its plan to help "close the
steel ring" around the central empires,
by Jointing in the Paris program for
concerted action.
Some hint of this German effort al
ready has reached the Paris public.
The Italian prime minister and for-
mertoed from an elevation outside the e'ign minister consequently received

The scene was Intensely grip
Great clouds of smoke, pierced

foreign office today.
The Germans, the United Press was
informed, learned of plans for the
super war council several weeks ago.
Alarmed at the prospects that the al
lies would frame a program for the
closest military, diplomatic and econ
omic collaboration for maximum ot
fenslve efficiency, the kaiser decided
on an attempt to take Verdun, believ
ing the moral effect of such a defeat
on the allies would halt the confer
ence.
At the same time he sent a shrewd
band of propagandists into Italy and
began a campaign designed to foment
trouble in Italy, in the German news
quite papers. The Germans particularly
feared that an important result of the
Paris ©oliference would be the appear-
ance of Italian troops on other fronts,
knowing that the mountainous nature
of muoh of the Austro-I\al1an front
prervents the use of all Italy's forces.
The Italian government was on the
alert and took quick steps to counter
act the effect of this German propa
ganda. The Germans' failure to take
Verdun dealt a final blow to the
scheme, one of the most ambitious at
tempts to create a breach in the ranks
of the allies since the beginning of the
war.
