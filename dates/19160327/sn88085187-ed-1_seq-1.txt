PETERS IN PENITENCIARY
PREPAREDNESS
The Acid Test of Americanism
It haR taken a handful or Mexican outlaws to show us, as
a nation, THK EXTREMITY OF Ml I NPHKPAKEDNKSB.
It Is fortunate for this country that this dramatic demonstra
tion n«§ given us by a baud of guerillas rather than by a first
class |>ower.
We could not even assume the task of chasing Villa, l>e
cause wlint small army we have was scattered in impotent
small detachments here and there, and because there were
neither men, nor animiiiiltion, nor equipment for instant pur
suit. Xow that the pursuit is on, America must be prepared,
IF XKCKHSAKY, to pacify all Mexico and perhaps even to po
lice the country till orderly government can be established.
We are doing far more than CHASING A BANDIT into tho
mounUiins.
It Is a very limited class of people in this country that
wants war. Most of us admit war is wrong. Most of us know
the strongest advocates of war are the munition manufactur
ers, WHO WANT Tt) COIX DOLLARS OCT OF IT.
At the same time, what are we going to do about it in a
period of almost INIVKKSAL WARFARE?
That is the question that we as American citizens must
answer.
That is the question that The Times submits to those of
it* readers who have disagreed with this PAFRRV CHAM
PIOXSHIP OF THK CAISK OF NATIONAL I'RKI'ARKD
XKHS.
We know that DEIT.XKKLF.SSXKSS Ik no bar against
jicioniwiow
We know there are HAMUEM in PREPAREDNESS.
But we know also that there are t.lli: VI I Si l> Wt.l.lts
in DEFENSKLKSHNKSS.
When we get right down to rock ImiUoiii, this prepared
ness issue is the add test to determine whether the I'nited
States is a XATIOX or Just a mass of short-sighted, wrangling,
si II isil LOCALITIES. This test must lie met.
We are going to have a military establishment. There Is
no doubt about it. Many of us don't like a mllitr.ry establish
ment. Many of un don't like to carry fire insurance on a
building. But there is no way out as long .is there are fire*.
The ideu that vast profit-seeking Interests are at the back
of this military program will avail nothing. Nor will the fact
that there is danger of this military program being used to
terrorize the American working class in- enough to block it.
The one fundamental fact stands out that the nation that
proceeds in the serene confidence that because s'ie never has
been attacked she never will be is THK XATIOX MOST IN
HAMMER.
If that system that makes all wars makes one here, tills
nation will struggle as hard as any other. As long as there
arc to be wars, there will be ar nuiment. As long as there is to
lie armament the ONLY POSSIBLE WMDOM H>lt THIS XA
TIOX IS TO OH AX ADEQUATE AKMAMKXT, AND THK
BKST.
The argument of the pacifists who oppose preparedness—
the argument that the I'nited States never prepured for any
war it has engaged in and therefore should not liegin to pre
pare now—is ridiculous. In all our history we have not faced
anything like present conditions. Nor have we alone ever
faced and fought a first-class power.
Kvery great general this country has produced has com
plained of lack of men and shortage of material. He has been
handicapped by the inefficiency and the wortlilessness of a
great majority of his troops, Dl'K SOLKLY TO mill;

Xo quack measures will do. There can be only one kind
of army—an army made up of trained soldiers.
If there In to be v military establishment there ran be only
one kind of military establishment. It mn -i not bo an "indus
trial army" scheme—a military establishment for the purpose
of knowing how to build macadam roads, or how to harvest
the Kansas com crop, or how to build Mississippi levees, or
how to repair motor trucks. A II that ftort of know ledge is val
uable, certainly, but it is not tlie sort of fundamental military
knowledge nor tlie sort of fundamental training that makes an
army.
Many persons are trying to disguise this military thing and
put the dose in more palatable shape so they can swallow it.
There is no use dodging the facts as to what an nrniy is, what
it must l>e, and it will be, IF IT 18 TO BK AX AHMY AT AM/.
I'rolwibly there is no such thing as an entirely democratic
army. The only approach to democrat ie ideas in an army is in
the Swiss system, through the fact that the officers come from
the ranks. If we are to have an army, let us fight for as many
democratic principles as we can get into that army, IH'T LKT
is ham: thf. Amir.
We should not blind ourselves to facts, even If they are
unpleasant. There Is a party growing up lietween believers in a
military jptahlishment and its opponent*. This party cannot
close its eye.s to the necessity of such a ncstahll.shmeut. Hut
they do not look at it squarely.. As a result, they are advocat
ing compromises and substitute*— QUACK MKASIKEB. Xone
of these plans should be seriously considered.
The only way to prevent all these necessities for n military
establishment is to overturn the existing system which causes
war. I ntil It Is overturned we face, in this country, tlie possi
bility of being in the same position as a province, or h depend
ency, of some strong military power. Overturning the system
that causes war is something entirely beyond human power to
accomplish, at present. Therefore, if we are living In an age of
warfare, ax we are, it is nece essflry either TO SIBMIT MM.
TIKKLY TO ANY AGGREIMION OH TO BE PREPARSOI TO
HKSIST.
First, then, we must be prepared. Xe\t, we must make
our preparedness along the lines that will prevent making war
profitable for munitions manufacturers and others of their
class. The government should manufacture the munitions. But
even if this is incapable of ace oinplislmient, till we must be
prepared. We must get the to ols, some way.
