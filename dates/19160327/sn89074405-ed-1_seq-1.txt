Paris. March 27—Detailed In
formation gathered here by the
American embassy indicates that no
Americans lost their lives on the
Sussex. All Americans, whose names
were on the passenger lists have
now been accounted for, the em
bassy states. It is possible, how
ever. that there mar have been
among the passengers some Ameri
cans whose names are not inscribed.
Washington. March 27.—It is stat
ed authoritatively here that should it
be shawn that a German submarine
attecked Sussex and that Germany
would disavow the act, offer repara
tion and punish the submarine com
mander, it would satisfy the United
States that the act was in violation
of instructions. It also is authorita
tively stated that the German ambas
sador, Count Von Bernstorff, mainly

ment of Grand Admiral von Tirpltz,
who is "understood to have been ellmi
nated because of his views on sub

XtaCtalnlng All Fasts.
American officials view the subma
rine situation as taking on aspects of
much gravity. The possibility of
breaking off diplomatic relations with
Germany is being discussed as one of
the eventualities which are expected
to follow if it is shown that the steam
ers Sussex and Englishman were vic
tims of submarines.
Officials say they are examining all
the facts in hand with open minds,
and Can come to no conclusion before
they have additional information, but
there is an undercurrent of uneasiness
over the possibility that German sub
marines have renewed their activi
ties against passenger-carrying ships
in violation of assurances given to
the United States by Germany.
Fired Torpedo Part.
Consular Agent Whitman at Bou
logne reported that he was informed
by French officials that a piece of
bronze, resembling the part of a tor
pedo, has been found on the channel
liner Sussex.
The state department officials said
they had ho information that any oth
er than German submarines are oper
ating in the vicinity In which the Sus
sex was attacked. All agents in the
vicinity are being urged to gather
conclusive evidence from all possible
agencies.
Columbus, N. M„ March 27.—A
speedy termination of the American
expedition into Mexico It not looked
for by General J. J. Pershing, com
mander of the forces In the field, ac
cording to advices received here.
Last night it' -was asserted that,
following a staff conference. General
Pershing announced that the people
of the United States Should not place
too much confidence in reports that
Francisco Villa, the bandit leader,
whose command attacked this town
several weeks ago, had been bottled
up, either by the American forces or
by Mtaloan troops. The nature of the
country, it was pointed out, renders it
dlffloult for any force to aurround ef
fectually a small band in the moun
tain passes with almost Impassable
trails offering a. means of escape.
While it was understood that Gen
eral Pershing does not attempt to pre
dict the length of time American
troops may be in Mexican territory,
it was intimated that the period may
extend into months.
Other reports also received yester
day from unofficial sources Indicated
that, with depleted troops in the field,
American military authorities bslleve
a sufficient number of men of all
arms of the service have been con
centrated at la Ascension, Cases
Grande*, Colonia Dublan and other
American field points, to meet the
needs of any emergency that may
•rise.

buried the body of Cook O'Neill, who
was murdered by Villa's company on
its way to attack Columbus.
O'Neill was one of the three ranch
hands of the Palomas Land and Cat

time. Captain Smith gave no details
in his report's* to the discovery of the*
body, which was the second of the
three to be found.
That of J. M. McKinney was found
several days ago, horribly mutilated
and hanging from a Cottonwood tree.
Reports received here from ranch
men that-an American aeroplane had
fallen near Janos, injuring the avia
tor and wrecking the plane, were re
futed by the report of an Investiga

aero corps.
Reports received from the front in
dicated also that with moderating
weather yesterday throughout Chi
huahua, American troops are not suf
fering so greatly from the cold, for

East of Meuse, Artillery has
Been Active—Night Calm
on the West Side.
Paris, March 27.—There were no
Infantry aotlons in the Verdun region
last night, this afternoon's official
statement says. East of the Meuse
artillery action Is violent along the
Douaumont-Vaux line. To the west
of the river the night was relatively
calm.
Transport Is Sunk.
Berlin, March 27.—Reports were
recetved from Athens that a French
transport, carrying a large number of
troops from Salonlkl, struck a mine
and sank, only 73 persons being res
cued, says the Overseas News agency.
Russians Make Advance.
Petrograd, via London. March-2 7.—
The sudden development of a Rus
sian offensive on the Dvinsk front,
which has taken the Germans by sur
prise. has during the past week re
sulted in a considerable advance by
the Russians over two of the most
important sectors—at Jacobstadt,
which protects the northern flank,
and in the Narocz lake region, which
defends the southern positions.
At neither point, although they
brought all available reserves into
action, and contested the onslaughts
step by step, were the Germans able
to stay the Russian advance. Although
from the official statement it might
be inferred that fighting of equal im
portance is extending over the whole
area known as the northern front,
stretching from Riga to the lake dis
trict south of Dvinsk. the main Rus
sian effort Is being made on the south
em portion of this line, where tlie
Russians are proceeding toward
Sventsiany. If pushed to a successful
conclusion, this movement would re
sult in the capture of the important
Vllna-Ovlnsk railway line, which now
serves the Germans operating at
Dvinsk.
According to reports from the front,
the' Germans, recognizing the proba
bility of such a disaster, already-have
removed their depots and supply sta
tions to a point west of Novo Alexan
drovsk, and their' activity in this re
gion now consists chiefly in construct
ing a line of fortifications consider
ably in the rear of those they now
occupy,- to which they may retreat in
case of continued Russian successes.

San Antonio, March 27.—Unless

ment of supplies over one of the rail
roads to the American troops in Mex

San Antonio, Teoc., March 17.—
With Villa known to be fleeing toward
his stronghold in the Guerrero dis
trict, closely followed by the troops
of General Pershing's command, the
problem of supplying the field forces
without the use of the railroad south
of the border Is becoming increasing

General Funston more anxiety than
any feature of the expedition- The

of the Mexiaan Central lines from SI
Paso to Chihuahua, but has delayed

"At five minutes past three when
we were about an hour and a half
from Folkestone we were seated on
the deck talking a little less, than half
way back on the starboard side. With
out the slightest warning there oc
curred a loud roaring explosion.
Wreckage and tons of water were
thrown into the air higher than the
masts, and the water came down on
the boat as far back as the stern. We
went forward and saw the entire for
ward part of the ahip including part
of the bridge and the forward mast
gone. Some men and women lumped
overboard at once and we threw over
rafta and seats to them. We then
went to help the women into the Ufe
boats and afterwarda to help the
wounded out of the debris. We saw
at least fifteen severely wounded and
helped with live ourselves. Among
these were Dr. Pen field and Miss
Baldwin.

of the American troops.
EI Paso, March 27.—Flying col

to entrap Villa and his band by seal
ing up all trails and passes in the
mountainous district south of B1 Val
le. Once the outlets are barred,
squadrons of cavalry and detachments
of infantry operating from the bass

Villa scattered his command In his

Villa now believed he had successful

to capture Villa. Returning American
