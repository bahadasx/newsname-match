(delayedi.-The German people through
out the empire today celebrated in semil
holiday spirit the remarkable success
of the fourth German war loan and the
dedication of the people themselves to
continued prosecution of the war.
Today's celebration made doubly posi
tive the answer of the people given in
the Reichstag yesterday to the claim
that they are tired of the war and wished
peace. In the most enthusiastic session
of the ]Reichstag recently held. Dr.
Hellffrieh, the minister of finance, an
nounced that the fourth war loan
amounted to 10.600.00.000 marks, or 60.
000,00 marks mvore than the credit orig
Inally asked for.
Nation Takes Day Off.
Today, while the schools were cloped
in celebration of the event and the na
tion was taking a day off in honor of the
occasion, one high officiul told me that
the amount stated by 1r. lelliffrich as
having being subscribed probably would
be considerably exceeded when a more
complete count ha been made.
In his address to the Iteichstng Dr.
Helliffrich, after announcing, amid stormy
applause, the result of the loan, said:
"Gerrmny has again peoved herself the
only belligerent country Ulat can cover
all its war expenses by a long term loan.
Just as I was able to say last Septem
ber, I am now again able to affirm that
the war Is financed for another six
months.
"No words of mine can express what it
means to a nation of nearly 70,0j,0j peo
ple to be cut off from the outside world
by acts of violence which are contrary
to the law of nations; but the remark
able thing is that this nation, which for
twenty months has borne the heavy bur
den of war, now in its twenty-first month,
once more offers to the country more
than 10,000,0,00O marks."
Shows Determination.
Dr. Siegfried Heksches, of the commit
tee on foreign relations in the Reichstag,
said to me today:
"This will show to the world that Ger
many is determined to fight to the end.
I will venture to predict that the fifth
war loan will be as readily granted."
ILater Herr Havenstein, president of the
Reichbank. said to me:
"The result of the fourth war loan was
a pleasant surprise. It far surpasses all
our hopes. It must be regarded as due
to the unconquerable will of the Ger
man people, rich and poor, to carry the
war to a victorious end, and to give
their gold and blood to achieve their
purpose.
"It should be emphasized that only
half a year has pessd since the third
loan was subscribed after a great effort.
"In this third loan it was perhaps ad
visable we thought then to give the
money market longer opportunity to re
cover, but we were anxious to catch the
turn of the fiscal quarter in order to
reach the great incomes. Thus a rela
tively short term separated the two
loans, which makes the present success
more remarkable.
Poorer Classes. Subscribes,
"Our efforts this time were largely di
rected toward people of small incomes
in the cities and in the country. That
we succeeded is proved by the fact that
the Credit-Genoasenschaften (Credit As
sociation), whose clientele is made up
of small savers, was among the great
est subscribers. It is also a sign of the
intensive work of our industries, com
merce and agriculture, that the small
subscribers are as numerous as the large
ones. Of course, this to a great extent
is due to the blockade Which compelled
us to work with doubled intensity to
make up for the former imports from
foreign countries, The fourth loan is
just between the second and the third,
The first loan gave us four and onie
half billions; th, second, nine billions;
the third, twelve billions, and the fourth,
ten and one-half billions.
"This makes the grand total thirty
six and a half billions, all from the
German people themselves, without any
foreign assistance, to sustain our armies
and navy in the combat,
"Unlike our enemies, we have been
able to censolidate all our war expenses
in long term loans, As a result, the
market is not only open to ibort term
credit, but we still have spe money.
for the next loan.
"I think we haeve a right to be proud
of this financial feat, which I doubt

MRS. HORTON GIVES DETAILS
Companion of Dentist at Plaza "Stu
dio" Says She Was Promised Hand
some Jewels by Accused.
New York. March 26.-At least one
other person is suspected of having been
implicated with I r. Arthur Warren
Waite in the "million dollar poison plot"
thdt resulted in the deaths of John 1.
Peek, the dentist's father-in-law, and
the latter-a wife.
This was the startling tack that the
dietrict attorney's investigation took to
dag. Very guardedly-and at the mo
melk when members of the Waite and
Peck families were seeking to have the
defendant "eome through" with a com
plete confession--officials of the district
attorney's omce and detectives hinted
that others were cognizant of Waite's
schemes to murder for noney.
The sinister revelation came after Mrs.
Dorothy Palemberg, living in West Se
enty-second tr-pt, had been closeted
with Assistant District Attorneys
Brothers and Dooling for four hours.
Friend of Mrs. Herten.
Mrs. Paimenburg is "next friend" to
Margaret Weaver Horton, she of the
velvet eyes and the dove-like disposition,
who shared a "studio" room with Waite
at the Hotel Plaza under the name of
"Mrs. A. W. Walters." The exarnina
tion of the two women haa practieally
absorbed the entire energy of the dis
trict attornes oice for two days.
"Is anybody else implicated with
Waite"7 Dooling was askcd when Mrs.
Palmentburg had flounced with a show
of anger out of his office.
"The evidence we have is sumeent in
the case of Waite alone." was the meas
ured and significant reply of the assist
ant prosecutor.
"You mean that certain phases of your
investigation now point to one or more
others being implicated with Waite"T"
"Yes," replied Mr. Dooling.
"Who else knew of the murder scheme
beside Waite himself?"
"This is so big a point," answered Mr.
Dooling, after a pause, "that I don't
feel that I should say anything about it
at this time."
Wants to Go to "Chair."
Waite today moaned out a desire to
be taken to the electric chair at once.
He expressed a desire to walve all legal
formalities.
"Why don't they take me out and have
it over with?" he cried at one period of
the day.
Waite early in the day begged that
Mrs. Horton be sent to him.
He made the re guest through Ray
mond Schindler, a private detective.
through whom he sought to make an
offer of 11,000 to Dora Hillier, the negro
maid, to perjure herself.
"Walte is playing a crafty game," said
Schindler tonight.
"I don't know whether he has hopes
to have Mrs. Horton tell a story that
will aid him in some way. I told him he
might see Mrs. Horton tomorrow if she
and the district attorney offer no ob
jection."
Mrs. Horton said tonight that she was
"through with Waite."
Husband Continues Loyal.
With her was tier husband. Harry Mack
Horton, who says he is an engineer. Hor
ton asserted his utmost legalty to iis
pretty wife. Husband and wife said they
had intended leaving town for the week
end. but the district attorney wishes them
to remain.
"Is Mrs. Horton under guard?" Assis
tant District Attorney Dooling was asked
after his interview. "She can't leave,"
was the reply.
"Is she watched?" -
"I won't say.' responded Dooling. "She
Is under a continuing subpoena calling
for her appearance during a certain
period of time."
In his guarded statement Mr. Dooling
gave hints indicating that Waite. during
the period when he was planning and sue
essfully accomplishing the murder of Mr.
and Mrs. Peck for their rmoney, was him
self the victim of a certain coterie.
Spent Money Lavishly.
Waite spent money on a lavish scale.
He always seemed to he well supplied
with cash. Mrs. Horton. Dooling re
vealed today, says that Waite offered
to buy her expensive jewelry at Fifth
avenue shops.
"She has not yet admitted that Walt.
bought anything for her." aid DooR
ing, "but we are eliciting new and
more imsportanlt informations from her
at every inter~iew.
"She now admits that Waite was
paying for her tuition at a dramatic
school. She -was registefed here as
