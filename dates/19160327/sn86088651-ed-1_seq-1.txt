People who think and make a study of what is best for the health of the family real
ize the importance of good refrigeration. They have learned the difference between an
ice box and a refrigerator. An ice box may be shaped like a refrigerator; it may have the
appearance of one. To be a refrigerator:
First, and most important is, the air circulation must be perfect.
Second: There must be proper insulation. These two things make a refrigerator.
Many other things of lesser importance enter into the construction of good refrigerators,
all of w hich tend to the ideal of those who seek the best.
If you arc going to buy a refrigerator we want to show you the best line of real high
grade refrigerators we have ever shown. Zl'Z' ? ' "T" '
