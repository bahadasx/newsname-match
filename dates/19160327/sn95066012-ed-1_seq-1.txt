Big Champion Did Not Linger to
Waste Wad
HE MAY NOT FIGHT AGAIN
Doe Not Like the Business and Will
Stop When He Gets a Competence
Saved Up.
New York, March 26. With his
right hand bandaged, owing to an in
jury to a knuckle of an index finger
and nearly 140,000 in big bills carefully
stowed away somewhere about bis per
son, Jess Wtllard, heavyweight eham
Dion, left here this afternoon. He ex
peots to join his family in Chicago to
. morrow and will rest up until tne nm
week of April, when he will begin a
six months tour with a circus.
.... SDeaklnK today of his bout with
Frank Moran at Madison Square Gar
den. Willard said:
"Moran is a great strpng fellow, both
clever and full of courage, but I think
I would have knocked him out last
nlKht had I not injured my right hand
early in the fight. The doctor says 1
will not be able to use my right hand
for at least two weeks. As to fighting
Moran again, or Fulton, or any other
challenger, my manager will have to at
tend to that matter. I am willing at
any time to defend my title and will
be ready whenever arrangements are
made."
Walter Monahan, one of Willard's
trainers, accompanied the champion
who did not show a mark from last
night's contest. There was, however,
a slight lump near the right temple
where Monahan hit him during a train,
in bout last week.
': Moran was up early this morning
and received many callers at his hotel
The Pittsburg man's face was puffed
and his eyeB discolored from Willard's
left hand jabs, but he was cheerful.
He was unwilling to admit that Wil
lard beat him and claimed that if the
seventh round had gone a minute long
er he would have knocked out the
champion.
"I want another go with Willard,"
said Moran, . "and would like It to be
for twenty rounds or more, as I ' am
not at my best in a ten round bout In
six weeks time I will be ready to meet
Willard or any other big fellow they
match me with. Believe me, I am not
going to remain idle, as I know I pos
sess every requisite to win the cham
lonshlp title."
Tex Rickard, who promoted the
.bout, said today:
"My partner, Samuel McCracken,
and I are satisfied with the result. The
sale of tickets amounted to a little
over $150,000 and this might have been
increased by fully $15,000 had we been
able to sell tickets to hundreds who
could not get through the police lines.
I have no intention of promoting an
other contest in the near future, as my
business interests demand my going to
South .America early next month. As
for matching Willard again I am in
clined to think that he will not fight
much more. By the end of this year
Jess will have acquired quite a sum of
money. The fight game is distasteful
to him, and as he is a man who lives
In moderation, and is anxious to be
with his family, I would not be sur
prised if he retired from the ring with
out again defending the championship.
ICICLE BREAKS HIS NOSE
Pittsfield Good Samaritan Is Knocked
Unconscious.
While attempting to remove icicles
that seemed to constitute a menace to
passersby, J. F. Colbert of 185 Bur
bank street, Pittsfield, was hit on the
nose by a big icicle near his home
Saturday afternoon and rendered un
conscious. He had just knocked down
one icicle and as he looked upward
again another fell and struck him. Dr.
A. C. England was called and found
that Mr. Colbert had sustained a frac
tured nose and lacerations to the face.
His sister was at the railroad .station
at the time waiting for a train and
word was sent to her on the accident.
She returned to the home and re

Fishing That Is Not Sport.
One way of catching herring Is by
driving nulls into n board so Unit they
stick out several inches. The boards
are then drugged through the shoals,
and the fish catch between the nails
nnd are pulled by the boiirdful lntu tbe
boats. Iu one year more than a million
pounds of herring were caught nt

Germans Fail to Stop Russian Ad
vance on Northern front
TEUTONS BUILD NEW DEFENCES
Activity of Russians May Necessitate
Considerable Change In Field of
Operations.
London, March 27. A dispatch from
Petrograd yesterday, sayB that the Bud
den development of a Russian offen
sive on the Dvinak front, which has
taken the Germans by surprise, has
during the past week resulted in a con
slderable advance by the Russians ov
er two of tbe most important sections
at Jacobstadt, which protects the
northern flank, and in the Narocz lake
region, which defends the southern
positions. At neither point, although
they brought all available reserves in
to action and contested the onslaughts
step by step, were the Germans able
to stay the Russian advance. Although
from the official statements it might
be Inferred that fighting of equal lm
portance is extending over the whole
area known as the northern front,
stretching from Riga to the lake (lis
trlct south of Dvlnsk, the main Bus
sian effort is being made on the
southern portion of this line where the
Russians are proceeding toward
Sventslany. If pushed to a successful
conclusion this movement would re
suit in the capture of the important
Vilna-Dvinsk railway which now
serves the Germans operating at
Dvlnsk. According to reports from
the front the Germans recognizing the
probability of such disaster; already
have removed 'their depots and supply
stations to a point west of Novo Alex
androvsk and their activity in this
region now consists chiefly in con
structing a line of fortifications con
siderably in the rear of those they now
occupy, to which they may retreat in
case of continued Russian successes.

by American survivors to consular
representatives in England and cabled
today to the state department
Survivors also declared one or six
life boats, launched after the explos
ion, had capsized, throwing its occu
pants into the sea. None of the five
bodies left on the Sussex was that of
an American. Two survivors, Drake
and Huxley, said so far as they knew
only three Americans reached life
boats. Fifteen passengers, Drake and

London, March 27. A statement is

lifeboats indicates they were part of
the air chamber of a bronze torpedo.
"During the present war six German
bronze torpedoes, complete, have been
picked up in the North sea and the
channel," the statement says. "There
is no portion of any French or British
torpedo or mine consisting of metal of
this size, thickness and strength. So
far as our knowledge goes, in every
case, except one in which a ship has
been torpedoed by Germans a bronze
torpedo has been used."

GERMAN PLAN AT VERDUN
Piecemeal Results With Minimum
Losses, Experts Say at Berlin.
Attempts in other countries to in
terpret tbe various pauses in the Ger
man operations at Verdun as indicative
of tho waning of the offensive or tbe
exhaustion of German troops denote
failure to comprehend German strate
gy, according to the tenor of discus
sion In military circles at Boston. Of
ficers say these pauses are only a part
of the general scheme of operations
and are designed to prepare for the
successive stages of the forward move
ment. - The method has been to make prepa
ration for every attack so thoroughly
as to guarantee success with mini
mum losses. German commando. 1
have purposely avoided a simultaneous
attack on the whole Verdun front and
have sought local successes in one
section after another.
Neither do these officers admit the
Germans aro fighting to revive tho
spirits of the people at home, with on
ly a forlorn hope of victory. It is said
these operations are intended to lead
to the capture of Verdun and hasten
tho termination of the war. The com
parative slowness of the movements Is
based on deliberate choice of the best
method of accomplishing the end
sought. Reports that the German
losses have been unduly heavy in view
of the results achieved find no confir
mation at Berlin. The results of the
operations at Verdun thus far, in re
gard both to the positions gained and
tho losses sustained, have been fully in
Una with expectations.
Karl Rosner, the correspondent on
the Verdun front of the Lokalanzeiger,
telegraphs that the German success
In the forests of Avocourt and Malan
t-ourt places the French northwestern
positions of Malancourt and Bethin
court in a precarious, situation because
they bulge into the' German lines", ex
posing the communications to flanking
attacks. Regarding the German attack
of Monday, the correspondent says
that terrific artillery fire prepared for
the infantry advance which began at
0 p. m. and continued until 10 p. m.,
when three French lines were broken.
The correspondent says the German
looses were quite moderate. Ho talked
with many French prisoners who he
quotes as being unanimous in saying
that they had been completely stupe
tied by the terrible effects of the Ger
man artillery.
Morocco's Commission City.

but an international city to boot.
Tangier was long ruled iu part by n

Now it is iu the Spanish sphere or
belt of influence, and that again Is
surrounded by the paramount French
power. The city itself is neutral and
starts with a boom, France having
written off part of its debt.

San Antonio, Tex., March 26. Fran

Namiquipa and three columns of Amer
icari cavalry are pursuing him.
Already they are almost 2o0 miles
south of the border and unless Mexi
can forces bring the elusive bandit to
a stand, this distance will be greatly
increased by the close of the week.
Villa's success in extricating himself
from the dangerous position in which
he had been driven by the American
punitive forces was related in a de
tailed report by General Pershing that
reached General Funston here today.
General Funston forwarded the re
port to Washington without making
public any but the essential feature.
Colonel Dodd is commanding the ad
vanced columns that are riding hard af
ter Villa and his men and General
Pershing has divided his forces so as
to provide supporting columns along
the thinly stretched lines of corarnuni
cation from his most advanced base

ROOSEVELT RETURNS
Refused to Talk Politics 'on Arrival
at New York, "
New York, March 25. Aftor a
stormy voyage during which the seas
were so high at one time that he had
to bail the water out of his stateroom
with a bucket at 2 o'clock in the morn
ing, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt got
back to New York last night on the
West Indies.
Although political leaders are agreed
that he tossed his hat into the ring
again by a statement issued at Port
of Spain recently, the Colonel said that
he must refuse to talk polities "for the
present." He took another jab at the
Wilson Administration because of the
situation which has developed in Mex
ico, and then turned the conversation
to the discussion of zoology. The
fact is that the Colonel believes he
has discovered a new species of bird.
Colonel Roosevelt never enjoyed
better health in his life than he did
last night as he stood in the smoking
room of the Matura and discussed
Mexico and his trip with the news
paper men who had met him at Quar
antine. He .looked in every way fit
for the strenuous political campaign
that leaders believe is ahead of him.
despite his refusal to discuss that pos
sibility. Ills only reference to his
Port of Spain statement was that he
had meant every word he said and just
what he said.
The return of the Colonel was ar
ranged carefully so that there would
be no attempt at a public demonstra
tion. The only person who went down
the Bav in the revenue cutter to meet
him, aside from the newspapermen,
was his secretary, John W. McGratri.
The moment the newspaper corres
pondents found the Colonel there was
a volley of questions about politics
and the developments in Mexico. They
elicited this statement, which ho dic
tated: "I am not prepared to make any
statement on politics at present, or on
the international situation, beyond re
ferring you to what I said in tho book
I published six weeks ago called 'Fear
God nnd Take Your Own Port.' If
you will'turn to tho chapter on Mex'co
you will see that everything I then
said, and have for the last three years
been saying, applies exactly to tho pre
sent situation, and that nil I said in
prophesy has been made good by the
event." , '.' .
