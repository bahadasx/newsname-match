SAN ANTONIO, TEX., March 26.?
Krancis-'o Villa lias escaped from tho
Mexican troops that had checked him
near Namiquipa. and three columns <>f
I American cavalry arc pursuing him.
Already they are almost CT.O mil.s

ican forces bring the elusive bandit to
a stand, this distance will be greatly*
increased by the close of the wecl<
Villa's success in extricating hlm
s?lf from the dangerous position into
which he had been driven by the
American punitive force was related
in a detailed report by General Per
shing that reached General Kunston
' h'.-re to-day.
General Funston forwarded th?* re
port to Washington without making
public any but the essential features.
Colonel Podd is commanding tbe ad
! \ itnceii columns that are riding harl
j.ifter Villa and his men. and General
1 Pershing has divided his forces so an
J to provide supporting columns along
the thinly stretched lines of communi
cations from his most advanced base
at El Vnlle. From 101 Valle, another
line is being maintained back to Casau
Grandcs from where communication
w ith the border is maintained. Oen
jer.il Perslilng. himself, is somewhere
} south of Casas Grandcs. directing the
work of holding t >gether his forces
and directing, so far as possible, the
operations of Colonel Podd. Cavalry

Three aeroplanes are at 101 Valle. ami
will be used in scouting as soon as the
high winds that have, been sweeping
that part of Mexico for almost a week,
J subside. These winds, aif ording to
General I'orshing, have made assist
jance by Ihe. aeroplanes impossible. Of
the eight machines that went into
Mexico, two are still out of commis
sion. They were damaged In tlie flights
from Columbus to Casas Grandee.
Details of the operations about
Namiqulpa that concluded with the es
cape of Villa were not revealed, but
there is little reason to believe that
he was badly whipped or oven weak
ened by the lighting directed against
him by the de facto government troopa.
Reports last week from Mexican
sources indicated that he had been
severely defeated by tho Carranza
forces, and a few reports said that
American troops had participated in
the action. It now appears that no
Americans were actually engaged, and
j the fact that Villa made his way
through what was described as an en
i circling line of Mexican troops was
jiak.ii to indicate that ho was th*
J victor.
I'nless fresh Mexican forces are sent
to meet Villa there appears no reason
