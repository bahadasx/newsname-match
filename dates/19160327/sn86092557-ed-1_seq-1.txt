ground that the legal cause of delay
was not sufficient.
The absence of Harry F. Smith,

"The coming of- Christ and its rela'
lion to'the present'Var" will lie the
subject of the discourse by Dr. 1. R.
Dean, at the 'First Baptist church
tonight, beginning at 7.30 o'clock. Dr.
Dean In announcing his subject last

haustive study o(the subject through
the scriptures and believed that he
bad discovered real light on' it.
Dr. Dean, who in a series of ser
vices ? Jie has' conducted in the First
Baptist church, has made a profound
impression on his hearers,J and not
withstanding the Inopportune time of
some of tho services, he has baU large
audlcnces- on- each occasion.
On Sunday morning Dr. Dean
preached on the subject of "Paul the
seven things" he lost and the seven
things he found". Among the . many
points brought out by .Dr. Dean' in
this splendid discourse was the moral
life of Paul and . of his ? apparent
claims to righteousness, and prior to
his conversion, all of which ho lost
at. the hour of. his;conversion, claim
ing his rights only through the blood
of JesuB' Christ.
Last night'Dr. Dadn - preached. on
the subject "Just What,the Gospel Is".
In the 'first of hisidiscourserhe stated
that Christ was the only sinless:per
aon who. had ever, existed, that-he was
the only person who had .been born
to die.and .that, he was :the, only'per
son who ,liad trusted'.God the. Father
whp bad been, forsaken by :him,.as in
the hour of his agony in Gethsemane,
and that he. .thopgh sinless himself,
