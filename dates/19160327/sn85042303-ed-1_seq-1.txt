i El Paso, Texas, March 27.
The American troops are at
tempting today to entrap Villa
by sealing up all trails and
passes in the mountain district
at El Valle. Once the outlets
are barred, the cavalry will at
tempt to drive Villa out into the
open.
The American forces have
bten permitted the use of the

cut between Madera and Juar
ez, it was announced today by
General Gavira. All communi

by the Mexican commander at
Madera.
The news that the Ameri

through the line of Carranza
troops. Villa has scattered his
j command in the southward
flight and at one time it was
j learned today, led only fifteen

LAFAYETTE AND WADE FORCES
LINING UP OKLAHOMA CITY
ALMOST EQUALLY DIVIDED, IS
REPORT.
Ben Ijifayette headquarters stated
to Le Cruce over the telephone this
morning that two precincts in Okla
homa county outside of Oklahoma
City instructed their delegates to the
convention next Saturday. Each pre
cinct had four votes and one was
for Lafayette and one was for Wade.
In the city of Oklahoma City 51 dele
gates were instructed for Lafayette
and uS for Wade. In the city GO
delegates were not instructed but the
Lafayette people claim from 33 to 40
of the uninstructed delegates.
These figures indicate that neither
Lafayette or Wade will have control
of the county. Oklahoma City has
been in the habit of sending an un
instructed delegation and then fight
ing among themselves. Lafayette
headquarters stated that Pontotoc
county would be in lino for the Che
cotah man, and that the state as a
whole looked very favorable.
What Carter county will do is not
known yet. The Wade people are
asking for an uninstructed delegation
and the Lafayette people are asking
for instruction. This indicates that
the Lafayette people believe them
selves the stronger, and the indica
tion on the other sido by not asking
for an instructed delegation admits
the ascendency of Lafayette. Both
of the men have some strong work
ers here, and things are getting lively.
As far as reports have been received
there are not a sufficient number of
instructed votes to control the con
vention when it meets next Saturday
and while the Lafayette people claim
the county, they may have a hard
H-ht to win it before the voting is
over.
MAN KILLED IN COURT
ROOM AT MILLERTON
Idabei. Okla., March 26. David
Fowler, just ice of the peace at Miller
ton, about fifteen miles west of Idabel,

day afternoon, in the court room. Pad
feeling had existed between the two

before the court of Fowler on several
occasions, but the cause leading up to
the immediate killing has not been
learned. Fowler surrendered to the
sheriff and was brought to Idabel and
lodged In jail to await action of the
court.

Night Telltale Finger Marks on
Victim's Throat.
Dallas, Tex., March 27. Willi te"
tale finger marks about the thiwt
and bruises on the face, the body
of Miss Zaola May Cramer, a trained
nurse formerly of Austin and Texar
kana, aged about 21 years, was found
on the campus of the High school at j
Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas.
The woman's clothing was disar
ranged and indicated that she mad';
a fight for her life. Physicians are
examining the body to ascertai.i
whether she was criminally assaulted
or not.
The motive i; mystifying to tin
police. That it was not robbery is
indicated by the fact that twenty-six
dollars was found in her purse, and
jewelry on her body.
It is believed that she was mur
dered about 8 o'clock last night.
Miss Cramer returned last night
from ISrownsboro, Texas, where she
had been on professional duties. It
is believed that whl:f- blie was going
from the railroad station to her home
which was within one block of the
school, she was attacked. Her body
was found by the school janitor this
morning.
The police nre mystified at this
crime, which came on the heels of
the mysterious murder of Mrs. Hugh
Perry last fall. Miss Cramer's suit
case was found within a short dis
tance of her body. It had been opened
and the contenls scattered.
TRAILS OLD MAN AND YOUNG
GIRL FROM THIS COUNTY AND
THEY ARE NOW IN JAIL AT
AMARILLO.
About two weeks a.o a man by
the name of Push who resides just
north of this city, went to the neigh
borhood of the Blue Ribbon school
house, and while the children were at
recess, it is alleged that he enticed
a fifteen-year-old school girl to run
away with him.
When the deed was discovered, the
parents immediately notified Sheri't
Garrett, who took tiie trail, with the
result that Hush is now in jail at
Amarillo, Texas, and deputies have
been dispatched to return him to thi;
county, where he will have to stand
trial on three counts, all of them most
serious.
The charges which the county at
torney statest will be preferred are
enticing, abduction and white slav
ery, and if the facts as obtained by
I the sheriff are true the chances are
' that Rush is in for a hard session.
The girl, Elsie Teague, is the
I daughter of a well known family of
the Blue Ribbon community, and in
dignation is very high in that neigh
borhood over the actions of Bush.
It is intimated by the officials that
there are others mixed up in the deal
and the sheriff has a man under sur
veillance that he can land at a mo
ment's notice if his suspicions are
correct. The sheriff lias been in
communication with him for several
days, and he believes from the con
versation and actions of the suspect
ed one that he is mixed up in the
case to a greatt-r cr lesser extent.

BOMBARD VERDUN
Berlin Says Violent Bombardment of
French Positions There Continues
and It is Believed New Attacks
Will Be Made North of Verdun.
More than one hundred yards of
German trenches were blown up near
Steloi today by the British.
The German war office announce
today a continuation of the violent
bombardment north of Verdun which
indicates the probability that new at
tacks by the Germans may be expect
ed in that direction.
Berlin declares that Saturday's Brit
ish air raid was a complete failure.
A German official statement says
that the west Prussian regiments
captured the artillery observation po
sition lost by the Germans on March
twentieth near Narocz lake, on the
Russian front.
The war conference of the entente
allies was begun in Paris today.
Russian Losses Appalling.
Berlin, March 27. The war cones
pondents on the, Russian front statu
unanimously that the losses of the
Russians in the new offensive are ap
palling, according to an Overseas
News Agency dispatch. "On several
occasions," the report says, "the Rus
sian artillery directed a curtain of
fire behind the Russian troops In
order to push them forward. The
first Siberian corps may bo said to
have ceased to exist.
Withdraw Before Russians.
Petrograd, March 27. The sudden
devleoptnent of a Russian offensive,
on the Dvinsk front, which has taken
the Germans by surprise, has, durin-;
the past week, resulted in a consid
erable advance by the Russians over
two of the most important sectors--at
Jacobstadt, which protects the
northern flank, and In the Narocz
lake region, which defends the sout'.
ern position. At neither point, al
though they brought all available re
serves into action, and contested the
onslaughts step by step, were th"
Germans able to stay the Russian ad
vance. Although from the official state
ment it might, be inferred that figlt
inir of equal importance is extendi! g
over the whole area known as the
northern front, stretching from Rig.i
to the lake district south of nvlns',
the main Russian effort i being mad.;
on the southern portion of this line,
where the Russians are proceeding
toward Sventsiany. If pushed to a
successful conclusion, this movement
would result in the capture of the
important Vilna - Dvinsk railway,
which now serves the Germans Of
erating at I vinsk.
According to reports from the fror.t
the Germans, recognizing the proba
bility of such a disaster, already
have removed their depots and sup
ply stations to a point west of Novo
Alexandrovsk. and their activity in
this region now consists chiefly in
constructing a line of fortification
considerably in the rear of those they
now occupy, to which they may re
treat in case of continued recent su?
c( sses.

ING CONTRACT WITH GAINES
VILLE REFINERY.
Jake L. Hamon fired the first gun
in the legil campaign to break down
the thirty-cent contract with the
Gainesville Refinery Saturday and one
j other suit was filed today. This Huit
was brought by K. A. Davidson, a nil
' nority stockholder in the Ideal Oil
Company. The defendants nre the
Producers Refining Company and the
! ideal Oil Company and the directors
of the latter company. The allegations
in this suit are very much along the
same line as those in the Hamon suit
against the Bull Heiad Oil Company
and the Producers Refining Company
except that the difference in the price
of oil at 30c, and the Belling price is
asked for by the plaintiff.
Papers are now being prepared for

satisfy the United States for the
torpedoing of the Sussex in vi
olation of instructions, if it was

by a German submarine.
Officials here say that they
are examining all the facta at
