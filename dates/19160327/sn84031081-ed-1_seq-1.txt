by messages from Villa, who reported!
great victories he said he had gained
over both Carrunza and the American j
columns and asserted that he would ,
soon drive the "gringoes'' over the,
border. K. F. l.'rosliy, an American, j
one of the arrivals, sail that the;
peons readily believed the wildest
stories sent oul by the VilUsias, one
of the most popular being that Pres
ident Wilson had fled to Canada and
that Villa was to occupy Washington.
He described the conditions of the
country people as deplorable. There
was an almost absolute dearth of em
ployment and Keyes had little diffi
culty in obtaining recruits by liberal
promises of loot.
pessimistic Outlook.
As far as ihe pursuit of Villa is
concerned the absolute dearth for
days of any definite reliable news has
caused much of the interest in Iho
chase to vanish into a feeling of com
plete pessimism. This was deepened
materially tonight by word from Co
lumbus, passed by the censor, that
General Pershing had little expecta
tion of a speedy termination to his
task und that he was preparing for a
campaign of several months duration.
Thi.s , information simply served to
buttress the opinion held from the
start on the border that there was
very hi1? lmpe I any speedy termi
nation to the career of Pancho Villa.
The stories of the snrrounding of
Villa, which have been current for a
week, were never iriven more than a
smile of derision by the men of

All Quiet at f:i Paso.
Only one ripple of excitement in re
spect to the iocul situation stirred El
Paso's Sunday calm. This was a re
port that American troops were pre
paring to cross the border at. Fabens,
thirty miles east of here. This report
was spread abroad after it was learn
ed that General Hell had ordered a
company of the Twenty-fourth in
fantry to Fabetis and that a troop of
cavalry had already arrived there to
reinforce the? troop which has ,pn
for some time on patrol duty. Gen
eral Bell said that the dispatch of
the Infantry was Just an "ordinary
movement of troops, with no special
purpose," but the story of the pro
jected crossing gathered renewed
force when it was discovered that
three- American scouts had been or
dered to report to Captain Moes. the
commanding officer at Fabens. Cap
lain JJoseg denied any intentions of
moving his men across the Klo
Grande.
Mayor Tom Lta. of Kl Paso, to
nitfht addressed a telegram to Sena

ing that anyone in EI Paso wanted
intervention for intervention's sake,
stating the government should be
prepared for am' contingency along
