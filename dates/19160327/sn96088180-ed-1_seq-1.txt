on wero aoriously Injured whon a
terrific explosion damaged the Brit
ish steamer Bussex In tho English
channel, but no United States rltUona
were lot, the American embassy an
nounced today. - '
Mis Calliope Fonnell. of New
York, reported killed, haa been lo
cated In Paris. The announcement
confirmed the report that Elisabeth
Baldwin and her parents, of Phila
delphia, had been saved. They are
at Boulogne.
Twelve bodies of passenger -and
sailors bnve been recovered. Seven
ty persons are etill missing. Doth
the United Slates embansy and the
British' admiralty are continuing
their investigations. No statement
lias been made as yet by the British
naval authorities, although the
French admiralty la positive that the
Sussex was torpedoed. A majority
of the survivors are confident that
tho explosion was caused by a sub
marine attack.
Iondon newspapers are In accord
that tho 8urox was torpedoed, and
are speculating as to the action of the
United 8tatcs.
t The Chronldo said:
"Obviously, no more direct .chal
lenge, ever has been handed another
nation than Germany has launched
toward the United States. Whether
the United States picks It up or lets
It lie, all belligerents will know with
a clearness hitherto lacking Just
where the greatest neutral etands."
Duplication of survivors' lists made
It probable today that the toll of
life might be more than 100. George
Crocker Is the, only American survi
vor at Dover reported tn a serious
condition. The others luftorod from
hook.
Berlin, Mar. 87. Reports that the
8ussex had been damaged by a Ger
man submarine were generally dis
believed here today. The admiralty,
however, has not yet denied the
charge. Teuton submarines oper
ating oft the French coast probably
will not return for days. In the
meantime, officials hoped that neu
trals would not base their opinions
of the disaster on allied versions of it.
Washington, Mar. 27 Diplomatic
relations 1 with Germany will prob
ably be broken off If the govern
ment finds that a German submarine
torpeoded the Sussex, bight admin
istration officials said today.'
Tbe president is awaiting facts,"

Secretary Lansing by, telephone. ; (
A fragment of bronie, such as is
used in German torpedoes, was found
In tbe wreckage of the- Sussex, ac
cording to information received here.
f it la also known tbat a German sub-
. marine was operating near where the
Sussex explosion ocoured.
The stats department's view is
tbat if it is established a submarine
was responsible, there will be no need
to Inquire as to its nationality, as
neither Turkish nor Austrian undor
aea boats operate in the English
channel.
The white houso holds the same
view. Thore probably will be no in

U. S. Army Headquarters, near

plane to Columbus, N. M.) Venus-
tiano Carranxa baa offered f 4 0,000
for Francisco Villa's capture, dead
or alive, It was reported today.
"We will outmarch Villa In the
next fortnight," said Brigadier
General Pershing, in expressing pride
in the spirit manifested by bis men.
"The boys are stepping with such
'heads-up' as was never seen in or
dinary maneuvers. If Villa holds bis
men together, the expedition has a
good chance of accomplishing Its ob
ject." '
Pershing Is confident tbat Villa
can not greatly Increase his force, as
massacring of Mexicans at Corralltos
ranch turned his own countrymen
against him. The alcalde of El Valle
from bis pulpit explained the real
purpose of the American expedition.
It was reported that one . Mexican
forced into - the Vllllsta army there
was a woman.
Pershing indicated that Villa was
fleeing due south from El Valle. His
whereabouts are apparently unknown
at headquarters. The Americans
have never, been In contact with Vll
llstas. A sniper once fired at an
American aeroplane, but missed.

keep up my circulation, I swung my
arms for hours at a time. i
"In the morning, with tbe aid of
my field map, and carrying only a
hint of water, I began a long hike
in the hope of reaching some of our
troops. I was afraid to eat for fear
I would need my rations later. At
noon on Monday I ran out of water,
but t still hurried on, In spite of the
heat the most unbearable I have
ever experienced. Soon I was con
vinced1 that I could never 'bold out
under those conditions, and I start

Paris, Mar. 27. Extraordinary
precautions were taken today to pre
vent Zeppelins from raiding tbe
building where representatives of all
the allied nations were meeting In
war council. Tbe biggest fleet of
aeroplanes assembled In months flew
out at dawn to form aerial scout lines
extending into the northern suburbs.
Working in relays, the swarms of
aircraft constantly circled over tbe
housetops, maintaining sharp watch
for German machines.
The weather was considered favor
able for Zeppelins. It was believed
there was little cause for alarm, but
no chances were taken of bombs
crashing through the foreign build
ing's roof while the conferees who
guide the allies' destinies were as
sembled there. -:.,.'
Among the men at the council
board while the aeroplanes cruised
the 'sky lanes to keep barm away
from them were the commanders of
the British, French and Italian
armies, the Serbian prince regent, tbe
premiers of France, Great Britain.
Italy, Belgium, Serbia and other na
tions. Military questions were dis

will be considered tomorrow..' The

"Another night on the desert and

I saw a Mexican running up. I got

I did not take any chances, however,

French Army Headquarters. Ver
dun, Mar. 27 Thrice baffled in their
efforts to enter Verdun, the Germans
are today seemingly bent upon the
city's destruction. Daily they burl
large incendiary shells Into tbe bus
iness and residential districts. I
saw several large fires raging simul
taneously in private bouses and
trades blocks. From a military stand
point, the city is nnscratched. Other
wise, however, it seems destined to
become another Rhelms, Arras or
Tpres. Destruction of its beautiful
cathedral, bishop's palace and other
noted buildings is threatened.
About 350 big shells crash Into
Verdun every day. Our party arrived
there during the morning when tbere
was a lull. I asked the commander
if be thought a bombardment would
occur, v. .
"Certainly, that's our dally ration,"
he replied. 1
As be spoke the terrific explosions
began. Tbe scene waa Intensely grip
ping. Great clonds of smoke pierced
by red flashes of flame rose over
the city. Guns hammered a titanic
accompaniment.
Northwest we could see the crest
of Douaumont under French fire. It
resembled Vesuvius belching black
smoke. On its southern slopes, Ger
man shells exploded thickly in flashes
of fire. Smoke geysers shot op like
magic mushrooms. ' ' '
Paris bad been confident about Ver
dun when we left the capital. 'But
we found it to be an axiom that the
closer one gets to the front the more
confident French soldiers appear to
be. ' :"-' . .
During the bombardment we enter

shelling. Groups of soldiers off duty
lay calmly on cots or sat on boxes
