PREPAREDNESS
The Acid Test of Americanism
(By the Editor of The Star)
IT ha* taken a handful of Mexican outlaw* to
-lii'W tt-. a- ;» nation, the extremity of our unpre
paredness It is fortunate for this country thai this
dramatic demonstration was given us l>y :• hand of
guerrilla* rather than by a fir«t class power
W'e could not even assume the la-k of chasing
\ ilia, because what small army wc have was scattered
in impotent -mall detachments here and there, and
because there were neither men. nor ammunition, nor
equipment for instant pursuit. Now that the pursuit
i» "ti. \meri»a mu«l be prepared, if necessary, to
pacify all Mexico and perhaps even to police the
country till orderly government can !>e established.
\\ e are d--ing lar more than chasing a bandit into the
mountains.
It i-> a very limited tlas» of people in this country
that want* war Most of u« admit war i* wrong.
Mo«t of u* know the strongest advocate* of war are
the munition manuia» turer>. who want to coin dollars
out of it.
At the s;inie time, what are we K"i"K do about
it in a peril"! of alnv-f universal warfare'
That i« the <«ue*tion that wc a* Xmericatt citizens
nut*! answer
That is the question that The Star tubmits to
those of it* reader* who have disagreed with this
paper's championship of the cause of national pre
paredness.
\\ i know thai defenselessness i* ri" bar against
aggression. .
We kn w there are dangers in preparedness
But we know al-> that there are greater dangers
in defenselessness.
When we get right down to rock bottom, this
preparedness i*«ue is the acid te*t to determine
whether the United Stale- i« a nation or ju«t a mas*
of short-sighted, wrangling, selfish localities. I*hi
test mu«t be met.
XV e are going to ha*c a military establishment.
There i* no doubt aU>ut it. Many of us don't like a
military establishment. Many of u* don't like to
carry fire insurance on a building. Hut there is no
way out a* long a* there arc fires
The idea that vast profit-seeking interests are at
the back of this military program will avail nothing.
Nor will the fact that there i* danger of this mili
tary program being used to terrorize the American
working da** be strong enough to block it.
The one fundamental fact stands out that the na
tion that proceed* in the «erene confidence that be
cause she never has been attacked *he never will be
is the nation most in danger.
If the system that make* all war* make* one
here, this nation will struggle as hard a* any other.
As long a- tlu-re are to be war*, there will be arma
ment A* long a* there i» to be armament the only
possible wisdom for this nation is to get an adequate
armament, and the best.
The argument of the pacificists who oppose pre
paredness the argument that the I'nited State- never
prepared for any war it has engaged in and there
fore should not begin to prepare now i* ridiculou*
In all our history we have not faced anything like
present condition*. 'Nor lia\e wc alone ever faced
and fought a first-class |nwer.
Every great general this country has produced
ha* complained of lack of men and shortage of ma
terial lie ha- been handicapped by the inefficiency
and the worthlessness of a great majority of Ins
troop due solely to their being untrained
\ll of our wars have been unnecessarily pro
longed, with a consequent heavier cost in life and
money, because we were never prepared for war
Had the North possessed KXI.OOO trained soldiers,
with adequate munition*, when l*ort Sumter was
fired upon, the entire history of the civil war would
have been changed It would have been a short war,
saving to the nation thousands of lives and millions
of dollars.
Adequate preparcdtie-s on the Mexican bonier
would have meant instant pur«ttit and probable cap
ture of Villa, and thus would have obviated an ex
pensive expedition and the possibility of a war with
all Mexico.
There is nothing in the idea that respect for the
opinion of the world will prevent one nation from
making an unprovoked attack on another. 1 here is
nothing in the idea that compliance with demand*-
and the desire to preserve peace i* any safeguard
against war Ihe European war has proved that.
There i- no security in the idea that link i» with

tary establishment for the purpose of knowing how

si* corn crop, or how to build Mississippi le\ees. or
how to repair motor trucks All that sort of knowl
edge it valuable, certainly, but it i» not the sort of
fundamental military knowledge nor the sort of funda
mental training that make* an army
Many person* arc trying to disguise this military
thing and put tbe dose in more palatable shape so
thev can swallow it I here t« no u->e dodging the
fait* as to what an army is, what it must be, and
what it will be. if it is to be an army at all.
Probably there is no such thing as an entirely
democratic army The only approach to democratic
idea* in an army i- in the Swiss system, thru the
fact that the officers come from the ranks If we are
to have an army, let lis fight for as many democratic
principle* •'<- nr «an get into that army, but let us
have the army.
Wc should not blind ourselves to facts, even if
they are unpleasant. There i< a party growing up
between believers in a military establishment ami its
opponents Ibis party cannot close its eyes to the
necessity of such an establishment But they do not
look at it squarely. \« a result, thev are advocating
compi tiiisc* ,md substitute* quack measures. None
of these plans should be seriously considered
The only way to prevent all these ne<essities
for a military establishment is to overturn the ex
isting system which cau*es war. I "litil it is over
turned we face, ill this country, the possibility of being
in the same position as a province, or a dependency,
of some strung military power Overturning tbe sys
tem that causes war is something entirely beyond
human power to accomplish, at present. Therefore,
if we are living in an age of war tare, as we are, it is
necessary either to submit entirely to any aggression
or to be prepared to resist.
l-tr*t, then, we must be prepared. Next, we mu*t
make our preparedness along the lines that will pre
vent making war profitable for munitions manufac
turers and others of their class. I'lie government
should manufacture the munitions. Hut even if this
is incapable of accomplishment, still we must be
prepared. Wc must get the tools, son,.- way.
If we, ;»s a people, are to continue to strive for
and advocate the things in which we believe the
thing* that mean human progress and human rights
we have got to have a country in which we can ad
vocate them and in wh can strike for them.
The richer the n stronger its defense
must be This nati' ' itest and richest, mu*t

WASHINGTON
ALARMED AT
THE OUTLOOK
By Robert J. Bender
WASHINGTON, March 27.—Diplomatic relation*
with Germany will probably be broken off if the gov
ernment finds that a German submarine torpedoed the
Sussex, high administration officials said today:
"The president is awaiting facts," announced the
White House. "President Wilson has asked the state
department to rush the work of gathering official re
ports. He conferred with Secretary Lansing by tele
phone today."
A fragment of bronie. such
as Is used In German torpe
does. was found in the wreck
age of the Sussex, according to
Information received here
It Is also known that a Ger
man submarine was operating
near where the Sussex ex
plosion occurred.
The state cepartment's view
is that If It is established a
submarine was responsible,
there will be no need to in
quire as to its nationality, as
neither Turkish nor Austrian
undersea boats operats in the
English channel.
The White House holds the
same view.
However, drastic steos will
await replies to requests for
further information which have
been forwarded to American
representatives.
Alt circles regard the situa
tion at most grave.
■Tirst reportt are always the
worst." said Senator Stone.
"We are still hoping that dan.
ger of a break may be cleared
away."
It has been known for weeks
that President Wilson has
