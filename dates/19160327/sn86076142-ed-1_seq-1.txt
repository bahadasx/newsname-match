DICK WALKER NOW IN CHARGE
OF OPERATIONS NORTH
WARD FROM BLAIR
Prof. K. K. Free of Johns Hopkins
university, chief chemist for Victor
Itrandt and associates of the Railroad
Valley company and the. alum-potash
property north of Blair, has returned
from the latter scene of operations
and is at the Mizpah. He took a num
ber of samples of the deposit and will
make analyses. Until this is com
pleted, Prof. Free cannot give out
any Informal ion relative to the value
of the material. He says, however,
that within thirty days it will be
known how valuable the deposit will
prove.
The material contains alum and
potash, which, when refined, will be
worth JH50 a ton at the present prices.
The output will nearly all be used
in the chemical trade, where it is
more valuable than as a fertilizer, al
though It Is available ror that also.
The process of treatment will be
leaching and then crystallization.

the days when it was "end of steel"

The actlvitieis in tungsten mining and
other mineral research are what are
giving Sodavllle the boom at the pre

posit at the edge of town Is not prov

difficulties attending Its concentra

westward Is everything that might be
desired.
This formation has been located
over and over again, but was for
either gold or Bllver. It has been var

It remained for Charles E. Noble to

Mr. Stewart says that the manner

matter was very oommendable. In

made exhaustive tests. He was then

officials said that they had no information of any other than Ger-
man submarines operating in the vicinity of where the Sussex was
attacked. The American agents have been ordered t gather con-
elusive evidence. Consular Agent Whitman, at Bologne, reported that he

WASHINGTON, Mar. 27. Th
American Federation of Labor's call
for a Labor's World Peace Congress, to
be assembled at the same time and
place the belligerents meet to make
the terms which end the world war,
was sent out today to the organized
labor movement of all countries.
Proposed first by the executive
council of the American Federation,
and approved at the national conven
tion in San Francisco last year.
Labor's World Peace Congress would
be an assembly of workers to demand
that the peace delegates of the war
ring nations determine nothing touch
ing the lives of the workers without
taking counsel with them. Such an
assembly of representatives of wage
earners close by the deliberations of
the peace delegates is expected to
have a large effect on the spirit and
determination of the latter.
