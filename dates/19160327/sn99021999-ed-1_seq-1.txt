WORLD'S LABOR
PEACEJJONGRESS
Call for Delegates from All Coun
tries to Meet at Time Nations
Make Treaty.
AMERICAN FEDERATION LEADS
WASHINGTON. March 26. The
American Federation of Labor's call
for Labor's World Peace congress,
to be assembled at the same time and
place the belligerents meet to make
the terms which end the world war,
was sent out today to the organized
labor movement of all countries.
Proposed first by the executive
council of the American federation,
and approved at the national conven
tion in San Francisco last year,
Labor's World Peace congress would
be an assembly of workers to de
mand that the peace delegates of the
warring nations determine ' nothing
touching the lives of the workers
without taking counsel with them.
Such' an assembly of representatives
ot wage.earnera close by the delib
erations of the peace delegate is ex
pected to have a large effect on the
spirit and determination of the latter.
Tort of Cll. .
The call for the congress follows:
"To"the organised labor movement of
all countries: '
'Friends and Brothers: Will you send
a .representative to attend a Labor's
World Peace congress? This congress to
bo held at the same time and in the sam
city as the representatives from the dif
ferent countries will meet to determine
the terms of peacz.
"The American Federation of Labor
convention, held November, 1914, four
months after the war began, adopted
a lesolutlon which provided for the call
ing of a labor congress for the same time
and place that the general peace congress
shall be held, which will determine condi
tions and terms of peace at the close of
the war. This action was officially com
municated to all national trade union
centers.
"The proposal to hold a labor congress
was generally discussed by the various
national labor movements during the last
year and some of them have officially
approved the plan.
'In other countries, thought Is con
centrated on the immediate and compell
ing problems of daily life problem so
urgent that all else murt wait upon the
future. We appreciate the Intense strain
with which our fellow-workers of Europe
await the outcome of the day's strugglo
on the battlefield and the ultimate do
clslon of the war.
"We are not unmindful of the Issues in
volved for Vhich men are shedding their
blood and giving their lives. We, too,
have been confronted by national prob
lems which have grown out of war con
ditions, and now our great concern U
that out of the horrors, the suffering,
the destruction of war, there shall com?
greater oportuntty, freedom and protec
tion for those who do the world's work
the tollers of all countries.
Hardest Falls on Workers.
"Everywhere the wage-earners by
service have proved their loyalty to
concepts of honor, their patriotism, their
value as men and women, ln the past
they have borne not only the burdens of
fighting during the war, but have been
weighted down by the war debts and
readjustments attending a return to
peace conditions.
"The workers ran refuse to be the
victims, of the blunders, the evil plans,
the smbitions of thue responsible for
this asr. In their struggle against op
pression have been bom yearnings for
human freedom, for better opportunities,
for justice in life and work. During
