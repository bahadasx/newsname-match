Consular Agent Whitman at Boulogne reported to-day that he was
informed by French otlicials that a piece of bronze, resembling a portion
of a torpedo, had been found on the Sussex.
Two American women passengers on the Sussex, it is understood,
are quoted in official despatches to the State Department as saying they
saw the wake of a torpedo just before the explosion on the Sussex oc
curred. No mention of that was contained in despatches made public at
the department.
One long despatch from Ambassador Sharpe was given out with
part of the original contents elided. This statement related all the evidence
obtainable up to yesterday regarding the wrecking of the Sussex, and told
of his efforts to clear up the question of how the vessel was.sunk. His
information, he said, was based on statements obtained from John H.
Hearley, Mrs. W. Warren, Miss Gertrude Barnes, Samuel F. Bemts and
F. W. Culberson, all of whom were aboard the Sussex when It was
attacked.
At the time the Ambassador sent his cablegram he still believed that
at least three Americans had lost their lives, placing Prof. Mark Baldwin
and his daughter among the number. Liter reports from London state
the Baldwins were saved.
