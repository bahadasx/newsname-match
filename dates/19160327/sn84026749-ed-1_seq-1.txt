Guard War Conferees
PARIS, March 27. Extraordi
nary precautions to guard
against a great Zeppelin raid
on Paris while the super-war

that has maneuvered above
the Japital in many months
took the air promptly at
dawn to patrol the skies.
Lines of air scouts extended
far outside the city over the
northern suburbs. Relays of
aviators kept constant watch
for Zeppelins from the dis
trict north of Compiegnc.

service. He had very great ability and
he devoted that ability to the promo
tion of tho things he thought were
right with a singular devotion and self
forgctfulncss.
"I feel that every man who desired
the public good has lost a partner,
and that the Democrntlc patty In loj
Ing him, as secretary of Its national
committee, has suffered a loss whlci
It may, not bo possible to repair at
alL""

German submarines that may have

U. S. NOT FORCED TO
PROVE THAT GERMAN
BOAT SANK SUSSEX
Official Says Government Will Act If It Is
Found That the Ship Was Torpedoed.
Burden of Proof On Germany As Result
of Disasters.
With the feeling growing in official quarters that the
steamships Sussex and Englishman were torpedoed with
out warning, it is declared that President Wilson may go
before Congress in a few days and lay the entire situation
before that body.
There is strong talk today that the immediate result
of such action would be a severance of diplomatic rela
tions with Germany.
Officials declared that if it is established that the ves
sels were attapked by submarines, the United States Gov
ernment wiU'not regard it as necessary before acting to
establish definitely the nationality of tjiesbmersiblesj
They regard it as, inconceivable that "Austria or 'Turkey,
'the- onlyolher cehtral powers with submarines, haviTSgnt
iheir vessels into the North Sea and English Channel
While there is some conflict between the American
embassies in London and Paris as to whether American
lives were lost on the Sussex, this doubt, it is stated, does
not alter the gravity of the offense. The position of the
United States consistently has been that Germany shall
not jeopardize the lives of Americans by refusing to ob
serve the rules of international law.
This position Having been clearly set forth, there is
no disposition to have further exchange of notes.
BASIS OF AMERICAN DECISION.
A decision, it is declared, will be reached quickly.
The facts upon which the decision will be based, it was
stated authoritatively, will probably be the following:
l. That the central powers have not rescinded
their proclaimed intention of attacking armed enemy
merchant ships without warning.
2. That in the last week there has been an. ac
cumulation of disasters to merchant ships in the
North Sea and British Channel that consljtutes almost
positive proof that submarines are attacking mer
chant vessels without warning.
7. That, inasmuch as it is inconceivable that
Austrian or Turkish submarines are operating in these
( waters, the assumption must stand that the guilty
submarines are. of German nationality.
It was flatly asserted by high officials of the State De
partment today that if it is accepted as a fact by this Gov
ernment that "the Sussex and Englishman were attacked
by submarines, the United States will go no further than
the foregoing assumption to establish the nationality of
the submersibles.
In 'Administration quarters' today it was declared that
the President regards the situation as extremely serious.
It is his intention, it was stated, to reach a decision as to
the course to be followed as quickly as possible. Action
ol some sort is looked for within a few days.
The President, it is stated, has reached a point where
he believes it almost useless to resort to further exchanges
of notes. Therefore, it is predicted, if he determines final
ly that Germany was responsible for these latest outrages,
and Congress approves, he will direct Secretary Lansing
io hand Count von Bernstorff his passports and order Am
bassador GeraYd home from Berlin.
VON BERNSTORFF FEARED WAR.
While Administration officials do not believe that
such action would necessarily lead to war, it is already a
matter of record that Count von Bernstorff in a recent
conference with Secretary Lansing, expressed the rear that
war would be inevitable if diplomatic relations were sev
ered. Count von Bernstorff is out of the city. He is ex
pected to return at any time. There is a belief in some
quarters that he will at once advise his government that
he situation is gravely critical, and that Germany, if will
ing to admit that a German submarine or submarines at
tacked the ships, should at once repudiate the attacks and
