Washington, March 27. Ameri
can officials view the submarine situ- 1
ation as taking on aspects of much
gravity. The possibility of breaking
off diplomatic relations with Germany
is again being discussed as one of the
eventualities which is expected to fol
low if it is shown that the steamer
Sussex and Englishman were victims
of submarines.
State Department officials said tliey
had no information that any other
than German submarines were operat
ing in the vicinity in which the Sussex
was attacked. All agents in the
vicinity were being urged to-day to
gather conclusive evidence from all
agencies possible..
Officials say they are examining all
the facts at hand with open minds,
and can come to no conclusion before
they have additional information, but
there is an undercurrent of uneasiness
over the possibility that German sub
marines ha\c renewed their activities
against passenger-carrying ships in
violation of the assurances given to
the United States.

The bold black line is that of the main highway as desired by Altoona, Tyrone and Huntingdon: the dot and long dash line is the proposed river route
by way of Hollldaysburg, which is shorter by some miles; and the dotted lines indicate tributary roads. The map was prepared by the Huntingdon Cham
ber of Commerce William Penn Highway committee. One of to-day's chief discussions had to do with the desire of both Altoona and Hollidayshurg
to be on the William Penn route. The Altoona delegation numbered some 3 00. The Hollidaysburgers numbered 40 and confined their boosting to quiet

road, is the best improved road in

fallen into disuse and now being rc- '
built by the Highway Department.

El Paso, 1 ex., March 27.—Flying columns of American cavalry
to-day are seeking to entrap l'raticisco Villa and his hand by seal
ing up all the trails and passes in the mountainous district south of
El Valle.
With the outlets barred, squadrons of cavalry and detachments
of infantry operating from the base near Casas Grandes, will comb
the country to drive the bandit in the open.
According to a dispatch from the <
front. Villa has broken through the i
Oarranzn line and is fleeing south- 1
ward with the American troopers i
straining every nerve to catch up with i
him before he reaches the forbidding ;
mountain wastes in his ancient haunts ]
in the Gxierrero district.
The one hope of a speedy termina- I
tion to the chase Is that the flight of '
the bandits will be checked by starva- i
tion and the exhaustion of their I
ponies, it. is known that Villa i 3 al- 1
most destitute of both supplies and 1
ammunition and the dead and dying 1
horses found along his trail give evi-;
dence of desperate haste and need. i
Once safely in the midst of the i
Sierra Tarahumares the task of run- i
ning - the bandit to his lair will have '
become one of tremendous difficulty.
This country is inhabited by the i
Tarahumare Indians, one of the most
distinctive tribes in Mexico. An Am
erican who owns a ranch at Omaro I
in the heart of the district and who
has lived there forty years gave this ]
description of the Tarahumares to- 1
day:

of any of the Mexican aborigines. If i
you treat them fairly they will stand'
