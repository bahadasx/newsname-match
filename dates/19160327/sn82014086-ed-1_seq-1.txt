London, March 26, 8 p. m. Three
British aeroplanes which took part In
a raid on German airship sheds In

German airship sheds in Schleswig

Sylt. The seaplanes were conveyed to
their rendezvous close to the German
coast by an escorting force of light
cruisers and destroyers under Com
modore Tyrwhitt.
"Three of the seaplanes which took
part in the attack are missing. The
destroyer Medusa was in collision with
the destroyer Laverock and it is feared
that in the stormy weather which pre
vailed last night the Medusa may have
been lost, but no misgivings are felt
as to the safety of the crew. Two
German armed patrol vessels were
sunk by our destroyers.

built in 191 4and displaced 965 tons.
She was armed with four-inch guns
