Effort is Being Made to Catch

(BY AMOClATr* MlfCY
EL PASO. Tex.. March 27?Pursuit
of Francisco Villa had developed
today into a race between cavalrymen
of the United States and the fleeing
bandits, mounted on their own wonderful
Mexican ponies.
According to despatches frotn the
front Villa has broken through the
Carranza line and is fleeing southward
with the American troopers
straining every nerve to catch up
with him before he reaches the forbidding
mountain wastes in his
ancient haunts in tho Guerrero district.
The one hope of a speedy termination
of the chase is that the flight of
the bandits will be cheeked by starvation
and exhaustion of their ponies.
REPUBLICANS ACCEPT
WILSON'S ASSURANCES
WASHINGTON". March 27.?
Threatened complications in the Mexican
situation disappeared Monday
when the Senate Republicans decided
to accept the administration's assurances
that Buflicient troops were
on the border for protection of the
American Interests and determined
not to harry the agitation for more
troops further at this time. General
Funston's despatches revealed no new
developments in the pursuit of Villa
ana reports iroui naval vessois on
both coasts of Mexico disclosed nothing
disquieting.
Eliseo Arredondo, General Carranza's
ambassador, at the direction of
his chief, presented to SecretaryLansing
some proposals to broaden
the protocol covering the joint pursuit
of the Villa bandits.
The proposals will be studied by
Secretary aLnslng before he again
? confer swlt hthe ambassador. The
only effect o ftbe new proposals will
be to delay the formal ratification.
The protocol suggested by General
Carranza was designed to cover use of
Mexican railways by American troops
in pursuit of Villa and would provide]
a working agreement under which in-1
structions could be Issued by both
government to the military commanders
to cover any contingency. Details
of the new proposals will not be
made public until Secretary Lansingl
has reviewed them.
It is believed General Carranza will
make no answer at present to the
specific request for permission to ship
supplies over the Mexican Northwestern
to American troops now more
than 200 miles south of the line. !
" J * ? I
Apparently, 11 is mt |iui iiuac u>
General Carranza to grant the request
under the terms of the protocol
when It shall have been completed,
rather than extend the permission
now and provide for it in the general
agreement.

ONE OF MU(
And There is Again Possibility
of Breaking Off Relations
with Germany.
( V AflOCIATIO P**??>
WASHINGTON. March 27?American
officials view the submarine situation
as taking on aspects of much
gravity. The possibility of breaking
o ffdiploniatic relations with Germany
is again being discussed as one
of the eventualities which is expected
to follow if it is shown that the
atnoiimra Snasnv and U!n pllahmliYI
U?VMIIIU< w ?<uwMvn
wore victims or submarines.
Officials say they are examining
all the facts at hand with open minds
and can come to no conclusion before
they have additional information
but there is an undercurrent of uneasiness
over tho possibility that
German submarines have renewed
their activities against passengercarrying
ships In violation of the assurances
given to the United States.
All administration officials refrain
today from making definite statements
as to futuro action or from
any definite statement go out with
the sanction of being official but
there was no concealing that everywhere,
the new situation was regarded
as very delicate. The impression
was general that if it should be established
that the ships .were victims
of submarines apd President Wilson
decided to take action he first would
consult Congress.
ENGINE TROUBLE
Causes Fire Which Destroys a
Large Touring Car of
Mr.Johnson's.
A large five* passenger touring car
owned and driven by R. E. L. Johnson
was destroyed by fire at 9 o'clock Sunday
nleht on the West Mllford road.
Mr. Johnson and' Dering Core drove
out the.Milford road to.the poor farm
and on their return trip the engine
balked on them. (After several unsuccessful
attempts to start the engine
they shoved the car off the road to
enable other cars to pass.
After working on the car for several
minutes' another came along and offered
to pull them into the'city. After
several attempts to pull the heavy car
out of the gutter, along the road the
rope broke and the'owner of the light
car decided to come to the city and get
a chain and return and pull the car
into' the city.
After the car had left Mr. Johnson
decided to try once' more -to start the
car and was-successful but:before he
got Into the front seat it backfired
and .the'gas tank was leaking and the'
gasoline'ignited and in a< few.minutes
the entire care was In flames. The gas
tank exploded and blew , the'front part
of the car to pieces. The car is a ;
complete wreck, only-the:metal parts
remaining.
When the. flre started* Mr. .Johnson
ran away; from .the car and escaped
