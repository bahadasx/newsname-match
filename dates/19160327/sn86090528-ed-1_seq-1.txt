ADDRESSES
HEARD BY
TEACHERS
Dr. Eskridge, Former Head of Women's
College, Lays Stress on Enthusiasm
and Supt. Ramey Urges Impor
i tance of "Preparedness"
PERTINENT POINTS IN
TEACHING DISCUSSED
Training of Youth Involves More than
Mere Textbook Lore; Educafors
Must Be Prepared to Inspire
and Mould Character
Among the notable features of the
proi-am of the Grady County Teach
ers association, which was in session
here the Irtter part of last week, were
the addresses delivered by Dr. J. B
Eskridge, former head of the O. C. W.
and now president of the state nor
ma! at Weatherford, and W. F. Ra
mey, city superintendent of schools
ic Chickasha, both of whom were lis
tened to with the closest interest.
Dr. Eskridge prefaced hie remarks
by stating that he felt glad to be at
"home" once more, meeting and talk
ing to old friends. Dr. Eskridge dwelt
strongly upon the necessity of- enthu
siasm in the work upon tho part of
the teacher. He said in part that the
teacher must have that kind of en
thusiasm which would communicate
itself to the pupils; that there were
several kinds of enthusiasm? but the
kind worth while was that which
came frjm a direct knowledge; that
it is net enough to fill the mind of
the pupil with a conglomeration of
odds and ends of superfluous things
found in boo'ts, without an accompa
nying fundamental 'understanding:
thnt here was where enthusiasm of
the right sort showed in enabling the
teacher to get. a grip on the pupil so
that the pupil might grasp and assim
ilate a knowledge of things taught
in the text books; that fundamental
kiiowled,Ti of all things was essen
tial to ths understanding; that the
t--reat conflict now waging in the
countries of Europe proved the pos
sibilities of disasters resultant from
lack of knowledge of fundamentals;
that the study of humanity was es
sentially more important than the
study of naked books; that this study
lead to the study and the assimilation
of all that might be good in any books
read; that there was a time when the
speaker did not believe in the old
saying that "one could not read a good
bonk without being a changed man,''
but that he had now come to reali'e
the axiomatic truth of the quotation.
Ko two persons can see the things
of this life in the same light, the
speaker asserted: "God has so ar
noiged the world that one person sees
its perspective through one manner
of glass and the other person
through another kind; no two may
use the same glass and no one person
may use the same glass tomorrow
which he has used today, the mind
of man mus-t accommodate itself to
the kaleidoscopic changes of those
with whom he is associated In order
that he may ba successful in life; par
ticularly is this true of the teacher
in accommodating his mind to the
changes in the temperaments of the
chi'd. Teachers should have implicit
faith in their own ability, must believe
in self in order to become successful
instructors; there is no more honor
ablo profession than m the profession
of teaching: teachers should show
the world that such is the case; that
the salary paid was the salary earned;
that the teacher who received more
pay than did his fellow, received it
l eeaufe he was a servant worthy of
i,a Viiro- that ha was paid better
than tho other fellow was paid, be
cause he was worthy more.
Supt. Ramey chose for his theme
"Preparedness." Mr Ramey, in part
said that preparedness was the sub
ject, which was now occupying the
ininJa and calling forth the discus
sion of the great men of this nation,
but that, his remarks upon this vital
subject would deal with the necessity
of preparedness of the teacher in
training tha youth for the battle of
life; character teaeheing was one of
the most important branches of edu-
mIIah tfiihiv and in order for tho
teacher to educate and strengthen the
characters of the student, Ua own
character should be well and duly
'tried in the crucible of preparedness;
that this might 'be possible the teach
er should have a broad and liberal
education and be familiar with tho
current events of the day; individual
ity should be put in all work of a
teacher; thia and ha.d work were the
great essentials to success; will pow
er must be a factor In order that will
power might bo instilled into the pu
pil's mind; preparedness on the part
of the teacher led to his having tho
courage of his convictions when right
and the courage, when wrong, to ac
knowledge that he is wrong; the bett
way for a teacher to become prepared
was througu hard work and study;
teachers should attend good summer
schools, o? wl. ich Oklahoma has num
bers; t.hi3 preparedness will lead to
the understanding of the characters of
rho children taught by the teachers;
like the grown-ups, no two children
had identical characters; the teacher
must lead the children along the
paths of real Ufa In order that they
may become prepared to meet and
surmount .lfe'a obstacles; patriotism,
love of country, should be instilled
into the minds and hearts of tho ones
the tfacher prepares for life.
