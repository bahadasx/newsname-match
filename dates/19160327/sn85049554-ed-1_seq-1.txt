Ellseo Arreaondo, General Carrari
za's ambassador, at the direction of
his chief, prelented to Secretary Lan
sing some proposals to broaden the
protocal covering the pursuit of the
Villa bandits.
The only effect of the new proposals,
Mexican officials here believe will, be
to delay the formal ratification
The protocol suggested by General
Carranza was designed to cover use of
Mexican railways by American troops
Details of the new proposals will not
be made public until Secretary Lan
sing has reviewed them. It is believed
General Carraqza will make no spe
cific answer at present to the request
to ship provisions over the Mexican
railways.
Apparently it la the purpose of Gen
eral Carranza to grant the request un
der the terms of the protocol, rather
that extend the desired permission now
and provide for it in the general agree
ment.
El Paso Asks For* Troops.
Senator Borah, of Idaho, before en"
tering the republican conference, re
plied to a telegram from Mayor Lea,
of El Paso, asking for more troops, by
saying the would do all he could to
have protection afforded.
"As a matter of fact, I do not know
Just what we can do," said Senator
Borah. "The administration says we
have all the troops that- are needed.
If that is a fact all we can do is to
stand by the administration."
Gunboat to Tampico.
The gunboat Marietta has been or
dered from Vera Cruz to Tampico to
aid in protecting American intrrests.
Today's report from Tan-.pico said
conditions were unchanged but that it
was desired to havo light draft navy
vessels at that point which -can go up
to the town. The battleship Kentucky,
now off Tampico, will go to Vera Cruz.
The ^-Marietta- and Machlae will re
main at Tampico as long as there is
any alarm. There are some 2,000 Amer
icans in ithe vicinity.
Navy advices from other points on
both Mexican posts reported quiet.

27.—Evidence that -Panoho Villa* is
preparing to resist the American pur
suing columns, and that as yeit'Mexi
cans have not rallied to him, have
been collected by scouts.
American trtops who have ridden
over the front to 3uerrero, where Villa
fled after the Columbus massacre,
have discovered indications that Villa
miscalculated completely when he
forecast that his raid, by drawing an
army into Mexico, would .cause a gen
eral uprising against Americans and
especially one in his favor.
The status of the chase today is that
Villa Is retiring continually southward
trying hard to force recruits into his
ranks, his men feeling the pinch of
hunger occasionally, and hoping for
an early arrival t£ sumineflu shield
them against the cold of the moun
tains, where they have retreated some
where south of Nomiquipa, in central
western Chihuahua, probably in the
Guerrero district
The one- question now bSlng asked
by the officers In the field is:
"Will Villa continue to prepare for
resistance?"
It is frankly hoped that he will, for
men who have been oyer the ground
here believe it will require months at
least to crush him.
An officer who has been thru many
passes where Villa had crossed with
in a week found that to all appear
ances the bandit had failed to inflame'
sentiment against the Americans.
