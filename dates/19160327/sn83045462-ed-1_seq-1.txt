OFFICIALS HERE AWAIT ALL FACTS
BEFORE TAKING ACTION IN MATTE]
Prior to Assurances of German Reparation, Situation Ha
Been Described as Exceedingly Grave-Every Effort
Is Being Made to Obtain Details.
It was stated authoritatively here today that should it be show
that a German submarine attacked the Sussex. Germany would di
avow the act. offer reparation, punish the submarine command*
L and satisfy the United States that the act was in violation of ir
structions.
It was also stated authoritatively that the German ambassado
Count von Bernstorff. was mainly responsible for the recent retiri
rnent of Grand Admiral von Tirpitz, who is understood to have bee
eliminated because of his views on submarine warfare after Count vo
Bernstorff had made certain recommendation to the imperial char
cellor. von Bethmann-Hollweg.
TAKE GRAVE VIEW OF SITUATION.
\nicrican uttivials view the submarine situation as taking n
a-ptvt? .if much gravity. The possibility of breaking off diplomat
relation- with Germany i- being discussed again a- one of tf
| i entuaHtics which are expected to follow if it is -Ivmn that t!
steamers Sussex and Englishman were victims of submarines.
Ifhrtals ?av thev are examining all the facts at hand with ope
minds, and can come to no conclusion before thev have addition;
information, but there is an undercurrent of uneasiness over the po:
sibility that < lerman submarines have renewed their activities again:
pa~senger-carrying ships in violation of the assurances given to tf
nited States.
