Residence in Heart of West
Side Respectable District.
Two nineteen-year-old girls wh
were .given municipal treatment for aj
loathsome disease at the police station
last .summer, were arrested in a raid j
made by the police Jast night in a j
residence they had rented furnished
from a minister. They are charged j
with maintaining a disorderly house.
Three youngsters were gathered in the
raid but they were released as harm-
less. The two girls. Bessie Roberts
and Mabel Clark, were held and plead- j
ed "not guilty" before Judge Robert i
Yates this morning.
The raid was made on the residence I
at 16-13 Clay street, ;.ust south of Cen- j
tral park, in one of the most respect-
able districts of the city. Officers
Woodward, Holman. McGovern. Alba,
Cook. Porter and Goff took part in
the raid. The -boys arrested are not f

Display of Hosiery.
The girls have been attracting con
siderable attention on Kansas avenue
recently by their displays of brilliant
ly colored hosiery. Apparently they
nave also attracted attention in the
' neighborhood to which they moved. It
j was through complaints of neighbors

Last summer the "iris were arrested
on charges of the same character and j
after they were ub the city jail it was; j
discovered that (hey were afflicted i
who a loamsome disease, it was at
that time the city went into the bust-
aeee of attempting a cure in such
cases. The Roberts girl was given a
long course of treatment and wide
was never claimed by the phyVIcianf
that a cure had been effected in either
case tney were finally discharged.
It was stated at police headquarters
today that both girls are in bad phv
sical condition. The three bovs werf
unsuspecting until Chief Harvey Par
sons took them into his confidence
and explained the situation.
Boys Are Warned.
"I felt." said Parsons, "that it was
due the boys that they be told of the
risk they had run. I told them and if
mere were ever three boys frightened
they were the boys, i told them to
pass the word on to all their boy
friends w ho they knew had taken sim
ilar chances."
The boys were back at the police
station this morning to get more in
formation. The girls will be tried to
morrow afternoon and Judge Yates in
dicated today that he had no leniency !
in his system for such cases.
The two girls rented the house from
Albert T. Fitz. an evangelist, March
16. The Rev. Mr. Fitz wae at the po
lice station this morning to tell the
officers what he knew.
"I ha1 no idea the girls were of
that character when I rented the
house to the Roberts girl," he said.
"She appeared decent enough when
she talked to me. She agreed to pav

They took the house immediately
and 1 had no suspicions for some time

The London statement that eleven
persons were "killed" indicates that
the Minneapolis may have been pur

marine, thougrh it is also possible the.
eleven were killed by the explosion of
the torpedo.
The first word of the sinking of the
Minneapolis was brought to Mar
seilles last night by the captain of the
British steamer Liecestershire. He
reported that he received a wireless
call for help last Wednesday, but ar
rived too late to be of any help, the
Minneapolis having already gone
down.
The Minneapolis was a 1 3.M3 ton
liner, one of the largest vessels sunk
by a submarine. She plied between
London and American ports before the
war ind figured in the work of rescue
when the Volturno
burned in mid-

British government for use in trans
