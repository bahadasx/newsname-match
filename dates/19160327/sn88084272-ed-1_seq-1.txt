MfcRICAX Expeditionary Force,
Colonla Dublan, March 26. (By
airplane to Columbus. N. M.,
March 27 ) Gen. J. J. Pershing last
night announced the establishment of
a new base ln the pursuit of viua.
The second base is much nearer the lo
cation where the bandit is reported in
precipitate retreat than tho old base
at field headquarters. The headquart
ers, it is presumed, will be maintained
as an imrortsnt link ln the supply sta
tion svstem, the chain of bases form
ing a strong military line, readily de
fensible reaching a distance Into the
interior of Mexico which is considered
iemarkable, considering the fact that

Reports here give irood cause for be
lief that thus far the American
troopers hav e pro ed themselves the
superiors in speed and endurance over
the famous Villa bandits There is
moreover confidence here that the cav
alrj will continue Its good work for at
least two or three weeks, by which
time It is possible that new organiza
tions can be thrown Into the chase
The headquarters officers ore all the
more proud of the cavalry's record
because they began the most recent
phase of the chase after one of the
longest, hardest rides an American
cavalry command has ever made. The
men still ln camp here express grow
ing impatience to mpunt and start

Sffey know the cold Is bitter and the
shelter on campaign duty Is anything

Gen. J. J. Pershing complimented
the stamina and the spirit of the troops
comprising the expeditionary force
No similar body of any army would
haTe arrived In better condition under
the circumstances, he said. The ser
vice encountered by the command in
cluded some exceedingly long marches
by the cavalry and wide etretches of
desert covered by the Infantry and
artillery.
The march of concentration at the
first base is not belloved here to havo
been equalled by any command of this
size in recent vears, and through it all
the morale of the troops has been ex
cellent. The men seemed to feel, the
general eald, that It was all a part of

Speedv termination of the campaign
is not looked for by Gen. Pershing.
Following a staff conference. Gen.
Pershing announced that the people of
the United States should not place too
much confidence in reports that Villa
lias been Dottled up, either by the
American forces or by Carranclsta
troops The nature of the country in
the vicinity of Namtqulpa, where Villa
is supposed to be, It was pointed out
by the general, renders it difficult for
any force to surround effectually a
small band, numerous mountain passes
and almost unperceptible trails offei
ing means of escape
while It was understood that Gen
Pershing does not attempt to predict
the length of time American troops
maj- be occuylng Mexican territory, it
was Intimated that the period may ex
tend into months.

protection of American interests and
determined not to carry the agitation
for more troops further at this time.

Eliseo Arredondo, Gen. Carranza'a
ambassador, at the direction of bis
chief, presented to secretary Lansing
some proposals to broaden the protocol
covering the joint pursuit of Villa ban

retary Lansing before he again confers
with the ambassador The only effect
of the proposals, Mexican officials here
believe, will be to delay the formal
ratification.
The protocol suggested by Gen. Car

Mexican rallwavs by American troops
in pursuit of Villa. Details of the new
proposals will not be made public until

SAV ANTONIO, Texas, March 27
Unless permission is granted soon
for the shipment of supplies over
one of the Mexican railroads to the.
American troops in Mexico, the pursuit.
of Pancho VilU may be seriously re
tarded. It was explained at department
headquarters today that the lengthen
ing lines of communication along heavy
trails had made it practically impossi
ble to deliver supplies by auto trucks
and that already a serious shortage of
grain for horses and mules had been
experienced.
With Villa known to be fleenig t -ward
hla stronghold in tho uueircro

Gen. Pershing's command, the problen
of supplying field forces without the
use of a railroad south of the border is
becoming increasingly difficult This
question is causing Gen. Funston nior
anxietv than any feature of the expedi
tion. "The advanced force has pen -trated
more than 260 miles Into the in
terior of Chihuahua.
Viinston Wants Mexican Central.
Gen. Funston desires the use of tha
Mexican Central from El Paso to Ch -buahua

Washington's request for permission to
transport supplies over the Mexico
North Western. No intimation of any
change in the railroad situation was
given? at headquarters early today
Many office rs are convinced that tha
success ot the operations depends on
the use of railroads in the territory.
They declare the matter ifl one of im
perative mtlitar necessity.
