Trying to Get Villa
Into Trap, Then Run
Him Into The Open
(Special Cable to Nippu .Hii.)
TOKIO, Japan, March 27. That the
native popftlation, more particularly
the rative troops in Indo-China. is
growing hourly more and more rest
less toward the French authorities is
the gist of the press despatches reach
ing here today. An open uprising is
expected at any moment.
According to the Information avail
able here now several Germans are
desperately engaged in agitating
amcngst the natives against the
French. How these Germans eluded
the French authorities and; gained
safe entry into the French posses
sions is a mystery yet to he solved.
The German agitators at any rate
have been successful in their mission J
as far as the native population is con
cerned and the conditions of uneasi
ness now are reported to prevail there
with every indication iointing to
ward an early rebellion.
