YUM EXPECTED
TO RESIGN IS
CHSRULER
Writer From China States That
Nanking Will Be New
Chinese Capital
(Special Cable to Liberty News.)
SHANGHAI, China. March 2t It is
reported that Yuan Shlh-Kal Is willing
to resign as . president and seeks to
make peace with the republican army.
The recent victories of the revolution
ists in Kwantaung have caused much
concern In - Peking, and reports re
ceived from the capital state that
there is fear that Canton will be cap
tured oy the revolutionists, 'r
-.- ' '"' 1 ' '
In a letter received from China, the
writer in descriling the Chinese sit
uation to a local Ch'neee states that
the revolutionary troops have the sup
port of the majority of the people of
China, and it is thought that with the
taking of Canton the republicans will
have an excellent opportunity to win
the entire section south of the Yang-tse-kian?
river. -
Nanking will be the new capital of
China, if the republicans succeed, is
the statement of the writer, and in his
opinion this will, be a big benefit to
China. He states that Peking Is diity
and that there i? an unhealthy atmos
phere in that city, whereas Nanking
is Vonsidered to be the cleanest city
in China. ',
In selecting Nanking as the next
capital the writer states that there is
plenty of room in Nanking to plan a
court, with Ideal , conditions ; for a
grouping of modern' government build
ings, and in addition to this the city
will be more central than any other
city in China which could be selected.
