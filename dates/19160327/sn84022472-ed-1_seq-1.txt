RAINEY OFFERS v
BILL CREATING
; TARIFF BOARD
Commission of Six Provided
In Measure Before ;
r ; House.
Washington, March 27 A substi
tute bill providing for a non-partisan
tariff commission, and said to. have
the approval of President "Wilson, was
'introduced in tbje House today by Re
presentative Rainey.
The bill would ' provide for the ap
pointment of six . commissioners at
$10,000 a 'year each, no-more than
three of whom can belong to the same
political party. The first appoint
ments are to be made for two,, four.
.six. eight, ten and twelve years, after
which the, terms of office of all are
to be for twelve years. The chairman
and vice-chairman must be- appoint
ed bi-ennially, according to the terms
teof the bill. . v
The duties of the commission are to
investigate the administrative and fis
cal effects of the laws of this coun
try, effects of ad valorem and spe
cific duties, all questions , relative to
the arrangement of schodules and"
classification of articles in the law
.and to put all information in its pos-
' session at . the disposal of the Presi
dent, the House -Ways and .'Means
committee and the Senate finance
committee.' "- ,
The bill would givte the. commission
full powers to investigate tariff rela
tions between, the United States and
foreign countries, -commercial trea
ties, preferential provisions, the ef
fect of export . bounties, preferential
transportation, the -volume of impor
tations compared with domestic pro
duction and of conditions, causes, and
eriecis relating to competition oi ior
eign industries including cost of pro
duction and dumping.-'' '
Representative Rainey said the bill
would not be. submitted to party
caucuses although to save . time it
probably would be added -to the 'over-'nibus-
bill. ' -
v "If enacted into law," he said, Ut
will come sus near removing' the tariff
unfair and unreasonable partisan ac
tion as any measure' yet conceived.
The measure would give the com
mission, full pQwer to compel the at
tendance of witnesses and give them
- access to and the right to copy any
document of any individual or Trust
iness concerning the production or
.sale of any article under investigation.

THOMAS J. PENCE,
NOTED LEADER IN
DEMOCRACY, DEAD
Secretary of National Com-
mittee masses jgLway at
Washington.
Washington, March 27. Thomas J.
Pence, secretary of the Democratici
National Committee, who had been ill
for several months as result of pneu
monia, died at his home here early, to
day, i '
President Wilson was deeply shocked
when i told of Mr. Pence's death and
expressed regret. With Postmaster
General : Burleson and Secretary Tu
multy, Mr. Pence had directed all of
the details of the political work of the
administration since the fresident
took office. '
Mr.. Pence probably, had as exten
sive acquaintance , among the Demo
cratic politicians throughout the coun
try as any man who ever occupied an
official' position with the national com-
inittee. He was one of the "original
Wilson men" and after, the last elec
tion1 was offered several . important
government posts. He declined them
all, .however, and became assistant to
the chairman of the Democratic Na
tional Committee in charge of perma
nent headquarters- here. At the meet
ing of the national committee last
week, he was chosen secretary.
Because . of Mr.' Pence's protracted
illness, W. R. Hollister, secretary "to
Senator Stone, recently was appointed
as assistant secretary of the national
committee and was designated by Mr.
Pence as acting secretary.

8-HOUR DEMAND

New York, March 27 The new de
mands 'of some 360,000 .engine drivers,
firemen, conductors and, trainmen, it
was learned today, will be submitted
to the railroads of the country next
Thursday. The railroads are to be
informed -that a reply in writing will
be expected by April -29.
The railroad employes ask for an
eight hour day and time, and a half
for overtime. The , demands I were

Engineers, the Order of Railroad Con
ductors and the Brotherhood of Rail
road Trainmen. '
The railroads already have said in

RAILROAD LOSES
'STOREHOUSE BY
$300,000 BLAZE
New Haven, March 27 No official
figures to indicate the loss to the New
York, New Haven & Hartford Rail
road by the burning of its general
storehouse in the local railroad yard.
last night, were available today. Un
official estimates 'placed the damage at
between $300,000 and $700,000.. An
item of loss is said to have been $10,-
000 worth of insulated copper wire,
used in electric transmission service.
President Howard Elliott, who came
here from Boston for'his regular Mon
day visit t his office, stated that just
as soon as 4 figures could be put to
gether it was' probable' that he could
give an estimate of the fire loss. At
best, he pointed out, this would be only
an estimate as the storehouse contain
ed almost every variety of railroad
supplies used in train service, repair
shops and construction. About the
only kind of supplies not in the build
ing were those used in maintenance of
way, such as rails and ties.
The storehouse which was burned in
part, was Q70 feet long, 40 feet wide
and of considerable height. About
150 feet of the westerly end was saved
with much of the contents. The other
buildings lost were the scrap iron
shopf and the pattern shop.
No theory for the origin of the fire
has been put forward by officials of
the company. The premises are being
searched in order to determine the
amount of salvage from the stores and
to locate if possible the conditions
which made it possible for a fire to
start apparently in the scrap iron
building. In the storehouse only half
a dozen men were regularly employed
and the number of employes in the
other buildings was not large. In the
entire plant generally described as
the repair shops, which included the
buildings burned, about 1,500 men
were employed. Most of these were
at work today.
Train service was " not., interrupted
today. The company, in a statement
today, said that in spite of the fire, :
through trains to New York last night
were only delayed about an hour-and
a half on an average. -
BOiO"
BATTLE
CIVIL SERVICE IS
PROMINENT FEATURE
Investigators Find Town
Clerk and Selectmen Of -fices
Can't Be Abolished.
Government of the city by five com
missioners is provided in the rough
draft of 'the proposed Commission
Form of Government charter, which
has been prepared by the special com
mittee appointed for that purpose. The
arait, as it stands, is only a tentative
plan and is subject to change and mod
ification before it is submitted to the
mayor for adoption by popular vote.
At present the committee finds that
because of the special provision in the
constitution of the state the town
clerk's office cannot be abolished nor
can the five selectmen or the 27 jus
tices of the peace be done away with
under any charter changes.
The five commissioners proposed by
the charter draft now prepared are to
head departments of affairs and effi
ciency, works, finance, welfare and
safety. It is proposed that the mayor
head the department , of -affairs and
welfare. He is supposed to be the of
ficial head of the city and direct af
fairs. Civil service,, which the com
jnisslon considered vitally necessary to
proper conduct of commission form of
government will be under the direct
charge of the mayor. "Out side of this
he would be the direct representative
of the city in all matters deali- i- with
the state or national government and
in affairs not especially provided for
by -charter. --
. The department of works would em
brace the paving and sewer commis-
sion, superintendent of streets, director
of -public works, harbor ' master, city
engineer's department and oyster com
mission. In the "welfare department would
be the board of education, charities
board, park board, library board,
city planning commission, vice com
mission, ice plant commission ' and
other, commissions- and boards of like
nature. -.''.
The finance J-omMirwioner, it is cal
culated, will have charge of the de
partments now conducted by the tax
collector, assessors, city treasurer,
sinking fund, board of contract and
supply, board of appraisal, police and
firemen's pension fund, sealer of
weights and measures, . board Of relief
and possibly the city auditor's of fice.
The safety commissioner will have
charge of the police and fire depart
ments, health department, health of
ficer, meat and milk inspection, city
sheriffs, buildingv commissioners and
inspectors, licenses and city attorney. '
Just what departments the office
of the city clerk, the registrars of
voters shall be , placed in has not
been decided. Some of the commit
tee faVors placing them under the de
partment that the mayor will head.
A plan to' have the office - of city
auditor retained and to have the in
cumbent chosen by. a committee ,or
national bank presidents who shall
have ex-6fficio supervision of city fi
nances as is now carried out in
onmo Commission eroverned cities, has
been discussed. ' '
There is- also under discussion a
plan , to have the board of education
kent intact though reoucea m per
sonnel to five members. The mem
br.t of the charter commission have
invited the school" board to a joint
mitna tn discuss the matter but
as vet the school board has set no
date for the meeting.
No provision is made either to con
tinue or abolish the board or appor
tionment and taxation. Tne common
nnncil of course is abolished. No
nrnvlsion has vet been considered as
to how the commissioners are iu
elected or what their tenure or oince
Refill be. .
Under the present system of gov
ernment there are1 79 officials who are
ouoi hv direct vote of the people
and 99 who are appointed. Outside of
the five commissioners who will be
elected, the town clerk, five selectmen
.nd 2 7 lustices. the commission cnar
ter proposed that attaches of all other
officers shall be selected roy civn
service. This means that their terms
of office will toe during efficiency or
good behavior.
Attorney Clarence ' R. Hall, secre
tary of the charter committee, said
today that all good commission government-charters
have civil . service,
the initiative the referendum and the
recall. . He believes these features
should toe embodies in the. onaner
to toe adopted here. Attorney riau
also said the 'better commission form
of voting provided for recognition of
proportional voting, whereby there
was minority representation as well
as majority in the government. -
Besides the features above Attorney
Hall said commission form Of govern
ment would provide a chance for the
electors to know the men they were
voting for not possible under the
present system of voting with nu
merous candidates on one ticket. He
said the public, will have advance in
formation on ,11 public questions toe
fore voting, financial statements each
month and much information about
city affairs which is not disclosed un
ed the present system.
The draft of the charter is at At
torney Hall's office and open for in
spection. The committee will wel
come any suggestions for changes
that may be made to advantage. The
mem.bers of the committee are John
S. Pullman, Hamilton S. Shelton, Cy
P. Miller, Lucien T. Warner and
Clarence D. S. Miller.
Clerk Hall expects to. go to New
York city this week to confer with
C. J. Hoag of the Burean,of Municipal
Research who is an authority on pro
portional voting and who will prob
ably come to this citj later to address
a public meetiner on the matter of
