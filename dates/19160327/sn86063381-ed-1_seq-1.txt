FOR HEARING
Payment to Be Made Soon Under
Claims Allowed by City
Officials.
UNUSED PORTION OF
LICENSES ABOUT $5,000
Liquor Men Will Fight Case, it is Be
lieved Citizens Backing
Case.
Judge W. Stanton of the dis
trict court today ordered city offi
cials to show cause why a permanent
injunction should not be issued
against the refunding of unexpired
liquor licenses.
Action has been brought by Edgar
O McGregor through his attorney,
Attorney Mowtreville J. Brown,
against the City of Bemidji, the
mayor, the city clerk and city treas
urer and Thomas McCarthy, George
A Tanner, Matt Thome, E. K. An
derson, Andrew Dahl, F. E. Brink
man, E. Maloy, John Bye, Harry
Gunsalus and E. Croon, asking
that no refund be made on the liquor
licenses of the former saloon keep
ers in Bemidji.
Hearing April 17.
Judge Stanton will hold a hearing
on the case April 17.
At a meeting of the city council
held Sept. 27, 1915, it was decided
that claims for refunding of unused
portions of liquor licenses be allowed
and should be paid as soon as the
money is available in the different
funds. The following claims for un
used portions of liquor licenses were
allowed: Thomas McCarthy $144.99
George A. Tanner, $37.58 Matt
Thome, $378.57 E. K. Anderson,
$490 Andrew Dahl, $695 F. E.
Brinkman, $861.91, all aldermen
voting "aye" with the exception of
Lahr and Phillippi J. E. Maloy,
$397.39 John Bye, $163.33 Harry
Gunsalus, $397.39 J. E. Croon,
$144 99, all aldermen voting "aye"
with the exception of Moberg, Lahr
and Phillippi.
In Behalf of Taxpayers.
Mr. McGregor alleges that he is
a resident and taxpayer of Bemidjj
and that he brings this action on be
half of himself and all other tax
payers in Bemidji. He also alleges
that Thomas McCarthy, George A.
Tannerr Matt Thome, E. K. Ander
son, Andrew Dahl, F. E. Brinkman,
J. E Maloy, John Bye, Harry Gun
salus and. Jt E. Croon were all li
censed to sell liquor in Bemidji, each
paying his $1,000 license fee.
Brinkman Closes.
The Federal government on Nov.
30, 1914, issued an order closing all
the saloons in the city under the In
dian treaty of 1855. Notwithstand
ing the order, alleges Mr McGregor,
the heretofore named liquor license
holders continued to operate their re
spective saloons after that date by
opening up "soft drink parlors" and
continued through the lives of their
licenses to sell at retail intoxicating
and malt liquors with, the excep
tion of F. E. Brinkman who discon
tinued the operating of his saloon on
the date of the order.
Claims Not Valid.
Mr. McGregor alleges that the
claims for unusued portions of the
liquor licenses presented to the city
council were not valid claims under
the law of the state and that the city
council allowed the claims in viola
tion of the law.
It is pointed out that nowhere in
the provisions of the Indian treaty
and Federal statuatory law is it pro
vided to be unlawful to sell intoxi
cating or malt liquors, the most that
is or has been provided is that it
shall be unlawful to introduce or
to be in possession of intoxicating
liquor in Indian treaty country.
Can Sell Liquor.
So far as the laws of Minnesota
are concerned, Mr. McGregor through
his attorney, Brown, alleges that it
is lawful through the lives of the va
rious licenses to to engage in the
business of retailing intoxicating
and malt liquors pursuant to the li
censes.
Demands Injunction.
Mr. McGregor alleges that the pay
ment of the claims will be without
authority of law, will be illegal and
unlawful ana that he has np remedy
