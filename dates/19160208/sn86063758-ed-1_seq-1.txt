practically finished with the appropri- :
atioB bill. aji<i it will go to the senate i
(next Tuesday niglit, when the two ?
bodies reconvene, after an adjourn- .]
ment since Friday, the senate having v
adjourned Friday afternoon and the
"house Friday night, until Tuesday h
night. The house on third reading will I
readjust the bill to make the totals j
conform to the changes and the re- p
capitulation be in keeping. ,\
L The more important amendments to ^
the bill included the $50,000 for pro- s
hibition enforcement and the $25,000 ^
for militia indebtedness to the Federal

the increase in the fund under

in the litigation fund for the attorney h
general's office. The ways and means ?
committee had cut down the attorney a
general's litigation fund and the appro- P
priation for the warehouse commis- T
sion, but these departments were given h
the same appropriations by the house t]
as last year, the ways and means com- $
mittee finally consenting. 1(
The statement was openly made in
the house that a coalition had been ^
formed between the prohibitionists and
the militia supporters to get the $50 - ^

^ -State Warehouse Appropriation.
The ways and mean committee had

commissioner down from $15,00
to $10 000 which wotrld have be :-n
tax upon the commission and would
ractically.have abolished the system

tie amount of the appropriation to
15.000, the same as last year, and aiding
the commissioner to use sucji

r'ght be necessary in the proper c^nuct
of the business. Both these
mendments were adopted by the
onse. and if they are concurred in by
3e senate will place the commission
pon a proper financial footing. ,
in the appropriation bill tnere was :
a item o? $15,691 to take advantage f
the federal- appropriation under i

There was a strenuous fight in the

The bill lias already passed * the
house, and there seems to be hardly
any doubt of its passing the senate and
going upon the statute books of the

Other Matters of Interest

circuit out of Colleton, Jasper, Hampton
and Beaufort counties and leaving
| Charleston alone in the 9ih circuit
I /mi inntin'1 . nf Spriatnr .Sinlclpr
made a special order for Tuesday.
The senate spent nearly two hours
debating the bill giving John M. Graham
permission to sue the state. By
a vote of 11 to 16 the senate refused
to strike out the enacting words and
i
the bill then went to third reading.
The bill providing for the left-over
liquor in former dispensary counties
to be sold outside the state by the
sheriffs passed third reading and went
to the house. The bill was amended
by Senator Sinkler so :js to allow t-e
old ^ispensary board in Charleston in
stead of the sheriff to handle the sa.e
of the left-over liquor tiierc.
Clearing the Decks.
With the appropriation bill practically
disposed of by the house, the bill
to abolish the tax commission and the
Verner bill to abolish free scholarships
the highway commission bill having
been killed by the house, the
Liles chain gang bill well on its
way to the statute books, and a way
having been determined upon to provide
the $50,000 for enforcement- of
prohibition, the* legislature, when the
senate gets through with the appropriation
bill, can either tackle rural credits
and other measures on the calen- j
dar, or it can adjourn. Adjournment
could be reached this week, but it is I
nrrkhohip at this writins:.

from the secretary of state's office was ...
made in response to a resolution
passed by the hous-e. "It reveals that
n some instances preliminary requireBents
for commission as a trustee
lave not been complied -with."
The Columbia Record says editorialy
in regard to this matter:- . ,
"Then all this talk of certain legislators
and other office holders toeing
?- -
;rustees of state colleges in vicriaujuu
>f the law must be a mistake!
"Upon reflection, we are convinced
;hat Winthrop certainly must have
nore than four trustees, the Citadel
n ust have some, and Clem son must
iave more than two. Reference to the
-eport of the state superintendent of
Plication shows that Clemson has six
md Winthrop has seven trustees elected
bv the general assembly.
"If these trustees nave been elected
od have not qualified, then their
places surely must be 'v acant and
-.horrid be filled by persons who would
observe the statute law of the state as
expressed deliberately and pointedly
n sectior 535 of the Criminal Code:
" 'It shall be unlawful for any per
>on to assume the duties of any "public
)ffice until he has taken the oath prorided
by the constitution, and been
regularly commissioned by the govern- ,
>r. The term "public officers" shall be ,
lonstrued to mean all officers of the
rtate that hare heretofore been comnissioner,
"the trustees of the various ]
colleges of the state/'-members of vari- j
>us state boards, and other persons
vhose duties are defined by law.' 1
"And if some ~who are now holding j
commissions from the state or federal ,

He has recently announced that he ^
will stand for re-election in the pri- a
maries next summer, and "he is now e
entering upon the fourth year of ser- r
vice as attorney general of this state.
JV't. Peenles comes of a family dis
o
tinguished throughout the generations 10
for public service; is a descendant of ?
the Peytons and Randolphs of Vir- ?
ginia; his. father's people are the old e
settlers of Barnwell district, In South
Carolina. He is a direct descendant ^
of Darling L. Peeples. who was a pioneer
in what is now known as Barnwell ^
county and was the first clerk of court ^
of the district, and was one of the pro- .
meters of thev old Georgia railroad,
which was the first steam road of the ^

neys' fees were paid, although many I
matters of litigation were handled by ir
the attorney general's office. Very
few cases have been lost, and during '
1915, none of the very important cases ri
that came within the jurisdiction of ,1V
the attorney general's office to handle ?
were lost. n'
Mr. Peeples has conducted many in- ^

phant. During the year 1915, two insurance
cases in which t'ne position of
the insurance commissioner was sustained,
came before the supreme court
of the United States. These two cases
were as follows:
Tne state, ex rei, i^noenix Mutual

;ign insurance companies to do b'usi- c
less in South Carolina, and the re- c

ioner as to investments in South Car- t
lina securities, etc. The two cases j I

ral on the 12th day of March, 1915, s
nd on the otn day of April, 1915, the o
jdgment of the lower court was af- r

ie crimes had been committed before 0
le enactment of the statute-changing i]
ie mode of punishment from, hanging

ey general was victorious in these
ises. *
A notable case also in which the at>rney
general was sustained was the ^
^tradition proceedings affecting.Fred- rick
Brown, alias Joe Grant, from
ennsyl'vania to South Carolina. Joe
rant was ordered to be returned to
ie state after 'having remained a D
lgitiVe from justice for many years. d
Of extreme importance was the.pro- s'
ibition case decided by the state su- c
reme court during 1915. This action M
as brought by John Henry Chappell, d
etitioner vs. R. M. McCown, secretary s
f state, S. T. Carter, state treasurer, d
. W. Sawyer, comptroller general, u
nd the commissioners of election of n
:ichland county, respondents. This a
as an action brought in-the original a
irisdiction of the supreme court, seek- a
lg to enjoin the holding of the pro- 0
ibition election provided in Act No. v
S, Acts of 1915, page 188. In this 11
iotion the constitutionality of the act
as attacked. The return on the part 13
f the respondents, filed by the attor- v
ey general, denied the jurisdiction of 0
le court to iseue an injunction against ?
ie holding of the election and also ^
anying the allegations respecting the ?
MLstitutionality of the act. The in- S(
mction was refused, thus bringing to
'.c attorney general's office another ^
ictorious wreath. e
In the case' affecting the tax comA]
ission, created at the last session of
ie general assembly, the position tak- ?
i by the attorney general in the near- v
. ? ' T,, J _? nM<. etic. ^

by the supreme court. The ap- u

i South Carolina., on which the tax ^
>rom4esion- wa#- attacked.
iHr. Peeples, in co-operation with the
officials of the State of New Hampshire,
was successful in getting a withdrawal
of a suit, l'or $30,000 against
the state for certain bonds issued in
1869.
These are but a few of the cases in
which the attorney general appearedt
during the year 1915. Seven appeal
cases in addition were argued by the
attorney general's office in the supreme
A A A?
wuu. Auuut twenty cases came up
in the court of common pleas, in whicL
the attorney general's office was interested
as a representative of the
state or some department of the state
government.
One cause brought by the city council
of Augusta, Ga., against auditor,
sheriff and treasurer of Edgefield
county, was handled in the distric;
court of the United States on the question
of jurisdiction.
, Iii the very first report he made to
the general assembly Mr. Peeples call- a
ed attention to the violation of the f
laws of this state with regard to trusts
and monopolies, and he referred to the
combination of water powers and to
the merger of manufacturing companies.
In his report which is submitted
to the general assembly, he has the
following to say: ,
"I recommend that our statutes be
changed so that we make imvestiga- .
Lions with regard not only to public
service corporations, but also with regard
to the violation of our monopoly
laws without, as it is now confined to
contemplated action, but it should exLend
fcfc the purpose of ascertaining
whether there should be any action or
not; the defect in our law consisting in. .
whether the attorney general should in ^
?ood faith intend to bring an action,
ind not upon the purpose of ascertains
whether the state should take aD
jropriate action. This I can not do
without an investigation. The interests
of otFr ^co^ora^ons^ a^d of our
iitizens, who have invested in them,
>ught- not to be disturbed unless there
s probable cause to find fault with
heir action and with their conduct,
should be the last one to suggest that
?e should give unnecessary trouble by
>rmging action wmen wuia oniiy reult
in bringing injury to them, vifch- .
ut advantage to the state. In the carying
out of these recommendations it .
5 necessary that I should have appro-:
riate funds given me to carry in?
ffect the obligations which the stat-.;. .
;tes of the . state impose "upon tile at-"V
orney general. If I have noHfte funds,
can do nothing, and I hope that tie
eneral assembly will deal with th*
ffice in a proper and liberal -way, haivig
in view economy^ but ktthe same - Lme
efficiency, if action is expected to
^brought by me in these matters/'"' * It
has been Mr. Peeples* endeavor t?
eep t'ne state out of as much tttiga-i
[ontion as possible. In bis &&Wa! ft- '
ort to the general assembly as to the
uties of his office, he says: #
<fAs stated in my former report, durig
the time I have been attorney genral
of Sonth Carolina, my effort has
een to serve all of the several state
epartments in every .manner possible
o that I might thereby assist them in
arrying'on meir duties in accordance
rith the law and in a proper and orerly
manner. The most important
ervice that can be rendered or is renered
by the attorney general's office
> by way of counsel and advice in conection
with the work of the various
epartments of the state fovernment
nd has been the case-during my term
t attorney general, also with various
fficers throughout trie state. In this
ray many matters are handled of the
tmn?t. importance that never come be
Dre the courts at all. I conceive it to
e my duty and have always endeaored,
if possible, to keep the state out
f litigation, and if it can be done withut
injury to the public service, for in
aat way, in my opinion, the interests
f government are more properly
erved."
With the knowledge that he has done
is duty by the people of the state who
leeted "aim to the high, office he holds,
[r. PeepJes now comes before the voire
and asks the people to re-elect bins
11 the record that he has made . One
'ho has observed very closely the at*
>rnpv areneral's demeanor was heard
) remark a few days ago: "There is
ne thing I can 'say for fDom Peepflefl,
bove everything else in connection
1th his office, and that is, that he has
iown no political favoritism. He has
