brought in by farmers living on the'

When news of the high water in
I Tutuilla reached Pendeton yesterday
i numbers of people made their Way to
the lower end of Webb street to note
the stage of the crek there. They
found only a little stream running
down thi channel and consequently

The Chinook struck on the foothills!
where the Tutuilla has Its source and j
rapidly melted the snow. A big vol
ume of w ater started down the creek
but as It proceeded u wall of snow
formed In front. As this dam grew I
it naturally retarded the progress of
the water and forced it to spread out i
when the flats were reached. The I
DOW on the ground absorbed some of
it and the ground also soaked up a
portion of it. Had the flood water
made its way down to the mouth of !
the creek, where the channel is nar- j

done much damage in the lower end!
