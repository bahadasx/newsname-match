AN OMNIBUS BILL

DARING POLITICAL STRATEGY
Cnt Income Tax, Repeal Stamp
Act and Flour Duty.
Make Whisky and Cigars Pay
Additional 35 Million.
Washington, Feb. 8. Passage of
one omnibus bill to include all reve
nue legislation, income tax, larin i
commission, the sugar duty and all j
other subjects was the daring political
strategy under serious consideration '
today by administration leaders. The I
house ways and means Democrats I
plan to meet Thursday to consider the
scheme advanced by Representative
Ciardner of Texas, who has been con
sulting President Wilson. According
to (dans, the bill would include the
following legislation:
Reducing the income tax.
levying new inheritance tax.
Repealing President Wilson's stamp
tax.
Increasing duties on whisky and ci
gars. Taxing war munitions.
Creating a tariff commission.
Retaining present tax on sugar.
Repealing the tax on mixed flour.
By advancing just one revenue bill.
Representative Gardner today pointed
out that many Republicans and Dem
ocrats would vote for it because of
some single item of legislation incor
porated. Gardner believes the Re
publicans would support the omnibus
bill to insure its passage.
The new tariff raising plan ad
vanced, increasing internal revenue
taxes on whisky and cigars, also is
gaining support. The present plan of
leaders Is to raise taxes on whisky
fifteen cents a gallon and change the
system of taxing cigars from that of
number to their value. This would
raise $35,000,000 it is estimated. The
whisky and cigar tax would be substi
tuted for the present stamp tax, which
raises $33,000,000 annually and is
scnenuied. for repeal.

PROBE OF CODDING
Warden Must Tell Why He Dis
charged Employees.
State Civil Service Commission
Would Know.
DIG INTO SO-CALLED REFORM
Governor Capper's Pet Measure
31ay Have Been Hit.
Complaint Filed by R. W.
Myers of Smith County.
Warden J. K. Codding of the state
penitentiary is to be called on the car
pet to explain wholesale discharges of
employees in violation of the civil ser
vice law. Codding's action has been
checked squarely up to the state civil
service commission and an investiga
tion of conditions has been demanded.
Complaint was filed with the com
mission by R. W. Myers, a former
prison employee.
A recent investigation of the peni
tentiary pay rolls showed Governor
Capper's pet measure had been cruely
t rumpled under foot by his reform
prison head. Since the civil service
law became effective July 1. 1915
S2 of the 89 prison officials and em
ployees had been dropped from the
pay rolls. A score of other persons
had been transferred many of them
to inferior positions and rank. All of
this action was taken without the con
sent or approval of the civil service
commission.
Wants More Light.
Now the civil service commission
has demanded that Warden Codding
show cause for his action in the Myers
case. Other discharged employees
either neglected or did not know of the
ten-day joker in the civil service law
and have lost their rights. Under the
law protest against discharge must be
made in ten days. That is one of the
real comedy provisions in the reform
law. Many of the employees did not
know of this provision in the law.
Later, when they were advised of the
little joker in the law. they found that
it was too late to complain.
Myers, however, was wise. Imme
diately after his discharge, he con
sulted Senator I. M. Mahin of Smith
Center. The case was taken before
the state commission. Myers demand
ed a hearing and establishment of the
glittering generalities of his discharge.
It was nearly two months ago that
Myers was discharged. His protest
was filed with the civil service com
mission and no announcement or
statement made by the commission
until the State Journal asked: for a
statement of the case. The commis
sion declined to discuss the case until
a hearing is held or announced. In
the meantime Myers is separated
from his pay check. So are 31 other
prison employees.
Replies Are General.
Replying to Myers's demand that
the prison warden set forth the causes
for his discharge, Warden Codding is
said to have made general replies. He
charged Myers - with insubordination,
violation of rules and other infractions
of general prison discipline. But the
charges were general, vague, indefi
nite and uncertain.
Then Senator Mahin came to town
and demanded that the prison warden
be specific. The commission ordered
Codding to be more definite and to
give detailed information. That was
ten days ago. The commission is still
waiting for some word from Lansing.
Later Warden Codding may be called
on the mat to explain his wholesale
discharge of employees in violation of
the civil service law. Myers insists he
will demand a thorough investigation.

WORST JO COME
Crest of Flood Due at Arkansas
City February 17.
lVater ow 29 Inches Higher
Than Ever Before.
Arkansas City. Ark.. Feb. 8. The
flood situation here has developed into
a test between man and nature. All
Interest is centered on the holding of
the levees against the ever piling up of
waters in the Mississippi river. The
inhabitants were waiting today for the
coming of the crest of the flood, prob
ably about Feb. 17, according to
weather bureau forecasts.
Since noon yesterday back water
filling the town has been at a stand
still. It now is 29. inches higher than
ever before in the history of the city.
The Mississippi river stood at 56 feet
this morning, topping its previous high
water mark by .6 foot.
The city is getting better prepared
daily for the tremendous force that
will hit with the crest of the water, ac
cording to Sheriff G. R. Tacy. The
levee is expected to hold 57 feet. Un
less further rainy weather occurs it is
believed the revetments wrill withstand
this stage.
Reports K.xaggerated-
Washington. Feb. 8. reports to the
war department today indicated that
the flood in the lower Mississippi
would not exceed previous records for
high stages at New Orleans.
A dispatch said that the president
of the Tensas levee board had reported
the situation at Arkansas City exag
gerated and hope was expressed that
the levees there would withstand the
pressure.

BY WILBCR S. FORRKST.
London. Feb. 8. The Idea that
Germany's fleet will come dashing out
of the Kiel -anal some day, equipped
with 17-inch guns that will blow the
English dreadnaughts to pieces, w-as
ridiculed by British naval experts to
day. The story about tire 1 7-inch guns
was first printed in a London paper.
Inactivity on the part of the German
navy, it waa explained, was due to
the fact that these guns, capable of
hurling more than a ton of metal a
distance of 20 miles, were being
placed aboard German warships.
Official utterances on the subject
are tabooed in London. Nevertheless,
it was learned today that British
naval officials believe the 15-inch
guns with which the dreadnaught
Queen Elizabeth is equipped, is the
maximum caliber for this class of
usage, especially in the North sea,
where the British and German fleets
might clash.

New York, Feb. 8. Charging that
the relations betwen her 7S-year-old
husband and another woman are "a

Jeanette Bernard of Winf ield, L. I.,
has applied to Supreme Court Justice
J Kapper in Brooklyn for $50 a week

The couple were married in 1892.

he became infatuated with Miss Jennie

It was asserted that Bernard paid
the expenses of a trip made by Miss
Thompson to Europe in 1912, and that
she built a handsome house about the
time he became interested in her.
Mrs. Bernard said that her husband
had given her less than $50 in the

the orders and began to tear them up.
Larimer laughed in his face. "That's
the best evidence on earth," smiled the
undersheriff. Cohn dropped the pa
pers and walked to the cloak room
and got his coat and hat. The man's
grip which was sitting by the table
was given a kick into the hands of an
other man connected with the sheriff's

ENGLAND SUGARLESS;
SWEET TOOTH DOOMED
London. Feb. 8.- More restric
tions on the importation of sugar
in order to redu-e consumption Is
the recommendation of a British
royal commission, whih says that
economies in the use of sugar will
influence the rate of exchange in
favor of Great Britain, as all the
sugar consumed here is Imported.
The commission st;ttfst that since
the beginning of the war the price
of sugar has doubled, but there
has been no Reneial reduction In
consumption. It urges that tnn
sugar in jams, biscuit, sweet
meats, chocolates, etc., be used.
