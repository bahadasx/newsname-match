Mann Helps Plan.
Mr. Mann reiterated his previous
pleas for a larger army and navy, and
aided in maneuvering the bills to pas­

"This is not the time for crimina­

"Why do they not put' those plans

"They will," Mr. Patgett said, "as

Representative Patgett' told tho
house that three ships, the Oklahoma,
Nevada and Pennsylvania, regarded
as the three best in the world at the
time they were designed and laid
down, would be completed and put in­
to commission during this year, two
of them in the early summer, one in

"If any emergency should arise,"
he added, "a very small resolution of

Phoenix, Fob. 7.—.Angered by T7ie
killing of one of their number by
white policemen, Indians of the Nava­
jo reservation, in northeastern Ari*
zona, are threatening an uprising, ac­
cording to advices received today by
Thomas Flynn, United States district
attorney.
Five thousand residents of the
northeastern portion of Arizona are
alarmed over the report that the Hopi
tribe of Navajo Indians were threaten­
ing to go on the "war path", accord­
ing to reports received here early to­
night.
Approximately1 25,000 Indians are
living on' tho Navajo reservation, but:
it was not known what proportion of
them were involved in I lie threaten­
ing uprising.
The Hopi Indians became angered
when one of their numbers was shot
several days ago by police officers.
The Indians opened fire on the offi­
cers when they attempted to arrest
him, ami was killed by an officer a
few filft'rnentS later, according to in­
formation received by Thomas Flynn,
United States district attorney.
The shooting occurred near Lee
Ferry, a crossing on the Grand Can­
yon of .Arizona, about 50 miles south
of the Arizona-Utah boundary line.
Word of the threatened trouble was
first brought to' Flagstaff by an In­
dian runner.
Although instructions from United
States authorities at Washington were
being awaited by officials here before
taking any action, a number of de­
puty United States marshals were
preparing to make the journey to the
reservation to investigate the report.
Efforts probably will be made to
have a troop of cavalry from El Paso
accompany the deputies to the scene,
it was said tonight.
The Indian reservation is located in
one of the most inaccessible portions
of the state. Flagstaff, which is
about ir0 miles away, is the nearest
point to which telegraph and tele­
phone communication are available.
Snow is several feet deep throughout
this section.
LOOKING FOR DESTROYERS.
Newport News, Va.. Feb. 7.—Hritish

British and the other Vench—are pa­
trolling the coast of the Virginia
capes. Since there is no probability
that, the German prLe Appam will be
put' to sea in the near future, marine
men take the presence of the war­
ships to mean that the Allied govern­
ments expect other prizes captured by
the mysterious German raider to be
brought to Hampton Roads.

OPPOSED HUERTA
Tioilfioil, Tlfieb. 7.—
Iriteff-Hiine addi­
tions to the von Papen correspond­
ence are 'contained in a parliament­
ary communication tonight. The cor­
respondence is relating to the papers
taken from Captain von Papen, the
former German military attache at
Washington, and the entries of his
bank account with the fac simile of
checks and stubs. The only revela­
tion historically important is that Ad­
miral Hintze, who was German min­
ister to Mexico in the spring of 1914,
favored international intervention.
Captain Karl L'oy-Ed, the former
German naval attache at 'Washington,
wrote to Captain von Papen opposing
Admiral Mintze's views and opposing
General Huerta.
Col. Herwerh of the German staff
wrote that the American military at­
tache al Berlin, Major Langhorne,
who left Germany early in 1915, was
the bearer of letters to German of­
ficials in America.
A letter from Edward Lyell Fox,
an 'American correspondent ni Ber­
lin, contained an unfavorable opinion
of the American ambassador, James
W. Gerard.
IPrinz iHatzfeld and Ithld Seiden
btirg of iNew York wrote concerning
the "stupidity and idiocy of Ameri­
cans," who the latter termed "Yan­
kees."
•George Sylvester Viereck. editor of
Fatherland, went on record as "ver­
ily ashamed of his country.''
George von Skal, former commis­
sioner of accounts of New York City
and a newspaper correspondent, who

von Bernstorff, the German ambassa­
dor at Washington.
CAPITAL CITY WILL HI
AT COMMERCIAL CLUB ROOMS.
At the regular weekly meeting of
the city commission held last night, a
resolution introduced by Commission­
er Battey, calling for a special elec­
tion to submit the question, "Shall a
public Library be Established by the
City of Bismarck?" was read and
adopted.
A donation of $25,000 is available
for the erection of a public library in
this city, provided the liorary is estab­
lished by the city. The proposition
will be put up to the voters of the
capital City, according to the resolu­
tion .February 21.
Voting places and election officials
were named by the commission and
will be announced later.
Sibley Island Park.
(A communication was read to the
commission from Representative P. D.
Norton relative to leasing Sibley Is­
land from the government' for a city
park. This proposition Jias been be­
fore the city commission on several
former occasions, but was nevter defi­
nitely settled. The privilege to lease
the island is still open to the city, but
unless immediate action is taken, the
offer will be withdrawn.
Commissioners Battey, Kirk and
Best were appointed a committee by
Mayor Lucas to look into the matter
fully and decide what action Will be
taken. Sibley Island is loe&ied about
five miles from the city, and compris­
es about 2.000 acres. Tbe island is
practically inaccessible at the present
time, and would be at any time unless
a bridge were erected over fito Mis­
souri from the mainland.

by the commission and routine bust

(By James Bertram, Secretary.
The above letter, received by President A. W. Lucas Saturn
day, marks the successful, conclusion of Bismarck's campaign for.
an adequate library building and places within reach of the Capita!
City a public library which will have but. two equals in the statdt
of North Dakota.
Bismarck is today the only city of more than 3,000 population,
in North Dakota which has not a public library. This faet is not
due to lack of appreciation upon the part, of Capital City people.
of the advantages to be gained from a library, but because here-•
tofore one cause or another has resulted in the defeat of well
planned campaigns to provide for such an institution. Mandan,
Fargo, (irand Forks, Devils Lake, Minot, Williston, Jamestown,
Valley City and Dickinson all have Carnegie libraries.

The 'Gate City, in fact, has three.

History of Movement.
The first movement for a Carnegie
library, it is believed, was inaugurate
ed in 1893, 'by Marshall Jewell and C.
M. Dahl. There was considerable
agitation favorable sentiment wis
aroused, and the Carnegie people
seemed inclined to consider Bis­
marck's claims. Then Coxey's army,
like a swarm of locusts, swept down
on this country, and .Bismarck bad
other matters with which to concern
itself.
Subsequent campaigns were initiat*
ed by M!ayor iF. H. iRegister, in 1901,
and later by Governor Hanna and
others. The Civic league at its very
inception named a library committee,
which has been active from that day
to this in awakening public senti­
ment to a realization of ^Bismarck's
needs. The City Federation of Wom­
en's Clubs at its organization ap­
pointed a committee for the consider*
ation of this important problem.
Commercial Club Interested.
The Commercial club became inteit
ested last spring, when, soon after
entering upon his first term, Pre*!
dent Young named a library commit­
tee, consisting of R. C. Battey, J. I*
Bell, B. C. Marks, F. L. Shuman aaft
George H. "Will. This committee, re­
cently reappointed for the enraiag
year, has never lost sight of its ob­
jective, and has co-operated with the
city commission and (Mayor Lucas itt
bringing negotiations to a successful
point.
