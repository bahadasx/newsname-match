In a letter to the Common Council.'
City Auditor Crenshaw explained that
the principal overdrafts are on account!
[of the city debt, occasioned by the!
I issuance of bonds during the fiscal
year; bills payable, of which amount
' SJOO.OOO was return of loans and S102.-1
I 205.30 on account of property acquired
'by annexation on November, 1011. and
i discount and Interest due to large loans i
i made by the city during the year Justj

In the following statement he shows
'n comparison of the receipts for the]
i fiscal year of 1014 and the flscnl year!
of 1015 and a complete statement of
nil appropriation accounts at the close|
of the fiscal year:
The unexpended balance to the credit
of bond funds aggregate $-17.1,55ft.8S, less
cash balance In hand January 31. lOHS.j
of $263,fi13.4<>. Thus the deficit at tliej
end of the fiscal year was, for funds'
| borrowed, $1,100,000, and for unexpended I
I appropriation?! from proceeds of bonds, j
| $ 170,550.88, making a total of ?1,570,-|
1550.SS, from which is to be deducted ?
j cash in hand. $2(13.f>l3.46, and for bonds'

Alderman Ordway Puller and Coun
j oilman Edgar H. English were strongly
opposed to recommendation of the teso
i I'jtion, each agreeing that it was not
.an opportune time i:i which to reduce
the board's membership, especially in
view of the fact that the charter
oli.u.ce amendment giving to th? people
iiic right ti> ele. t ;i commission to form
a new charter has been passed ami is
now before the cb-neral Assembly.

Mr. Pullet r-ai.i t:,at the hoard had
, not had time in which properly to jus
tify its existence, and that if any of
? its members had b> licved that redue
tion should be effected. they should
. have appeared before the joint Com
j mittee on Charter Chances*. Mr. i
? Puller tbought the ptes? nt numerical
? strength should he maintained, so that i
new blood and force might be brought
into the hoard, and lie stated that the
| services of the late member during his J
activity had been value to, and of sav
ing to, the city because of'his wise
! counsel and his deep interest in Hieh-j
1 mond's welfare.
j Mr. English pointed out that every
; time the Mayor was called i to decide
j a vote, it would require a threshing
, cuit agajn of ail *lie arguments on the
j point at issue, whereas if there were
J five members, there would not be such j
? tie lay.

service would be obtained from three

. tlie amount of money it is given to the
j board to expend has nothing to do with
I the question, and Councilman English j
opposed the resolution further on the
grounds that it would be further en- j
larging the powers of the Mayor, when i
| the proper thing to do would be to i
leave the whole matter to the decision j
| of the people. There" was a rather'
I Sharp passage between Mr. tiunst ami
J Mr. Puller as to their respective views. I
! but mutual explanation of the fact
that each was voting according to his I
belief brought harmony again.
Aldorman H.indon T. Christian op- .
posted reduction of the hoard member- 1
ship, saying that it would be prefer- !
able to give the board a chance, to work
out its) salvation, and that if It failed,
recourse could be had later to the peo- |
pie. Mr. Powell reverted again to his I
statement that the reduction would '
save the city ?"?.fififi a year and. in addi

which provides that the repeal shall

jected
Following the receipt by Speaker
Houston of an opinion bv Attorney
fieneru! T'ollard. in which he liebl that
the Wright bills providing for the re
peal of the seed uvster and .lames
Uiver cull line laws in their present
form were unconstitutional, both bills
were recommitted to the Committee on
the Chesapeake and Its Tributaries.
In the afternoon the committee drafted
new bills, modified to meet Mr. Pol
lard's objections. These will be placed
on the calendar to-day.
; The bills which were found to be
! defective provided for the repeal of
the present law fixing I lie cull line in
James Uiver. and foi a shifting of the
line to Newport News; and for the re
peal of the law prohibiting the ship
ment of seed oysters out of the State.
Both of these changes were demanded
by the oyster tongers. who claimed that,
the two laws have produced in the
State this year such a glut in the seed
oyster market that the oystermen are
unable to make a living.
ATTIvMI?Ti:i> I'd VKST I.IMilSI.ATIVK
l"?>\V Kits IX COM MISSION
While providing for the repeal of the
two laws, the bills undertook at the
same time to vest the Commission of
Fisheries with the power to put them
again in force when, in its opinion, the
State's oyster industry was: threatened
b> the lifting of the embargo
The Attorney-'Seneral. in his opinion,
held that it was unconstitutional to
delegate to the Commission of Fish
eries legislative authority, and that,
because the bills did tills, they were
defective. He sucgested. however,
that the <;eneral Assembly would have
the right to give to the Commission of
Fisheries the power to grant permits
for the taking of seed oysters from
the area now closet! by the cull law,
upon the ascertainment of certain
definite facts. In the same way, he
suggested, the commission could bo
empowered to grant permits for the
shipment of seed oysters out of the
State.
While the distinction drawn by the
Attorney -General wa. looked upon b\
friends of the Wright bills as finely
drawn, it wa- conceded even by the
oystennen, who would have preferred
these measures, that it would be tin
wise In the extreme to enact a law
which might later prove to be worth
less. The new bills which were ap
proved yesterday l>y the committee to j
take the place of those held defective
meet the objections raised by Mr. .
Pollard.
Uepresenta t it ? s of the tongers \ej-- .
terdnv were not overplensed with the j
developments, since the new bills will j
leave the present laws in effect. he j
Commission of Fisheries will practl- j
cally command the situation. This
body will be vested with the authority,
in effect, to suspend temporarily the j
present cull line and seed oyster laws,
when, upon the ascertainment of
definite farts. tlx suspension comports
with the safety of tli?' industry.
As originally drawn, the bills re
pealed th? iaws and gave the commis
sion the right t.. restore them when
necessary. Cndcr tl;-' .itihstitulo bills,
the present laws stand unless set aside
temporarily through the medium of
special permits to he granted by the
commission. If the commission and
the oystermen should fail to agree on
the question of fact, the former hold
ing that conditions do not Justify the
suspension of the. law and the. latter
holding that they do. the tongers would
have a remedy only in the. courts.
While the oystermen were inclined
at first to oppose the substitute meas
ures, they withdrew their opposition
when it became clear that only in this
way could the present situation be re
lieved. The Commission of Fisheries, in
Its special report to the Governor, in
dicated its belief that conditions this
year warrant a temporary suspension
of the oyster seed law.

' pleas for a larger army ami navy, and
aided in maneuvering the hills to pass
age. "This is not the time for crimina
tion ant! recrimination." said he. "Tt
is not the time to And fault with that
which has been. Tt is the time for all
to join hands for that which may
, come."
The debate went far afield from the
measures under consideration, exteud
; ing to the general subject of military
; preparedness. The unusual sight of
! the Speaker and the minority leader
battling together for administration
? measures, while the majority leader
sat silently in the hack of the House.
'attracted crowds to the galleries, ami
members rushed to the tloor from their
j otllces and committee rooms.

"Simply because," Mr. Padgett said,
"the chief of the bureau of construc
tion told us that he had plans already
worked out that would make decided
improvements against torpedo attack."
I "Why do they not put those plans
into operation'."' the Speaker continued.
! "They will." Mr. Padgett said, "as
j soon as they get authority, provided in
. this resolutIon."
1 "We shall all die of obi age before
; they are completed at this rate." the
; Speaket responded.
Uepresentntive Padgett told the
House that three ships?the Oklahoma,

the three best in the world at the tl. ie
they were designed and laid d.v.-n,

in the early summer, one in the

"If any emergency should arise." he
'added, "a very small resolution of

propriation could provide for extrai

Representative Cannon, of Illinois,
created a stir by askintr if the talk
of preparedness was a sham perform

a criticism of the President.

answered Mr. Cannon, "is my President'
as well as your President, and if I,
can find out what is the proper thing t
to do?if it is necessary to do any-1
thing?I stand ready to help hint do it."
"If we ever have another war, which
I do not believe we will have if we
attend to our own business," Speaker.
Clark said while advocating the Naval'
Academy bill, "what we will need more
than anything else will be otTicer.-i.
You can get all of the volunteers you

The President did not request Sec -
retary I.ansltig to conn; to the White
House for a conference to-day. ami the
conference which had been planned did
not materialize. The secretary expects

fount v?in Iternstorff. the German am
bassador. may be .summoned to the State
, Department some time during the af
ternoon at'I informed of the decision
! of the I'nlted States.
Confidential advices received to-day
from high oflicial quarters are to the
' effect that the expressions of optimism
[regarding the outcome of the negotia
tions which have been heard in cer
tain ollieial and diplomatic circles are
; not without foundation. Chairman
[Stone, of the Senate Foreign Ilela

that he believed the cas - "was prac

ilt was authoritatively said at the
State Department that the position ot'
j the government to-day in regard to
the Lusitania cast! was identical with
tin: position taken at the jime the Inst
j note was dispatched to Germany.
| Secretary I.ansintr to-day flatly de
nied that new demands hail been made
I in tile l.usitania ease at a time when
' the German government considered tho
] negotiations practically were at an
end. lie was speaking ? ? f llerlin dis
patches, quoting the references by Dr.
/'itnniei iuan, German Under-Secretary
: of Foreign Affairs, to "new demands."
"This government," said Secretary
l.ansinsr. "has not increased tin- de
: mauds made in the f.usitania case as
set forth in the notes of May HI, Juno
and July 21. I doubt if Dr. Zimmer
man ever made the statement that
new demands had been injected, be
cause lie must know that it is utterly
| false."
Secretary I.ansint? would not go into
details or discuss Dr. Zimmerman's
?
statement further. When Dr. Zimmer
man's statement was published in this
| country, however, his reference to new
I demands was taken to apply 10 a possi
ble contsruction of the word "illegal"
iri the proposed form of settlement.
| The only ground American oflicials could
find for construing that as embodying
a new demand was the possibility that
it might be considered applicable, not
ulono to the destruction of neutrals on
the l.usitania, but also as to the method
by which she was sunk.

recurrence of anything so obviously
subversive of the- principles of war

Note of June 9?"The government of
the United states very earnestly and
very solemnly renews the representa

loth of May."
Note of July 2!? "In view of the ad
mission of illegality made by the im

Germany a.s being inhumane, calls at
