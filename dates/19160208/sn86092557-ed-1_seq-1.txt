The Union District Roads Commit
tee met this afternoon in tho County
Court room at the Court House and
their report for the next mass meeting
of the voters of Union District was
revised and arranged In a more clear
and comprehensive manner. This re
port will be placed before tho next

At Least So Declares a Chaf
feur Suing For
Wages.
"A man ought to be paid more for
driving a Ford tlian for driving a
Packard or Pierce,Arrow."
This is one of the interesting state
ments made by one of the expert wit
nesses In the case of J. H. Connors vs.
W. B. Campbell which was being heard
in Intermediate Court today.
The litigation originated when Con
nors obtained judgment against Camp
bell in tiio Justice's court for money
alleged to be due him as chauffeurs
wages.
The testimony divulged some Inter
esting facts concerning the habits of
automobiles and their owners.
It seems that Brown originally start
ed to work as demonstrator for Camp
bell who is the distributor in this ter
ritory of the Partln-Palmcr automo
bile. Connors spent most of his time
demonstrating to a Mannington wom
an and failed to earn anything on a
commission basis.
So he is now suing Campbell for
chatfeurs wages. Attorney M. W. Og
den represents the plaintiff and H. S.
Lively the defendant. The case was
given to the jury at a late hour today
The members of the jury aro as fol
lows: A. P. Harr, Alph Curry, T. B.
Henderson, Wayne Satterfleld, Wm. O.
Bailey, Samuel W. Linn, J. R. Nuzuro,
W. E. Beall, W. R. Powell, Dayton L.
Mayers, R. L. Musgrovo, P. T. Huddlo
eon.
The jury In the case of James B.
McKee Cigar Co., vs. M. N. Glumlclch
thlB morning returned a verdict to the
laintlft. for tho sum of J59.75. This
Jury was composed of the following
members: H. N. Johnson, C. R. Tooth
man, Chappy Norris, Charles W. Rob
inson, J. A. Reed. J. II. Merriflald,
J. H. Snodgrass, LawreniV Higg3, Cy
