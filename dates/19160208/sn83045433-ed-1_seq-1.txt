Plot to Wreck Weiland Canal
Uncovered in New York City
Conspiracies Alleged to Have Been Fomented in the United
States and Plans Laid for Attack on Canada from
This Side?War Stores Purchased.
Speeiftl to The AVtrfUDctiXi Herald.
New York, Feb. 7.?Alarming disclosures !
of the extent of the German conspiracies
against Canada carried on ln the l'nited
States have been made today following \
the activities of the Canadian secret
service agents, who have been at work ?
In this city and other points throughout:
the country. Among the findings which
have been forwarded to the Canadian
government are:
German agents have secretly purchased
two hundred thousand Mauser rifles and
surreptitiously shipped them to the Cana
dian border.
In the guise of Belgian refugees and of
Scandinavian Immigrants scores of Ger
man army officer? have arrived here
from neutral ports with tty? object of
heading an armed force for the Invasion
of Canada.
The destruction of the Weltand Canal
and the crippling thereby of the shipping
of fUOO.OOn.ono of Canadian wheat to the
allies is the main object of this secret
movement.
Jini? Munition Mor?-??
One-third of the output of American
munition plants has been purchased by
German agents masquerading as repre
sentatives of the allies, and this vast sup
ply of munitions, mainly consisting of
rifles, has been stored ln secret.
The destruction of the Canadian Par
lisment Building last week and the at
tempted destruction of munition plants
sre the work of sympathizers with Ger
mans.
One Canadian authority said todsy that
the attempted raid on Chinada was to be
made within two months.
The information obtained here has been
forwarded to Gen. Sir Sam Hughes,
the Canadian War Secretary, and to Col.
Percy Her wood, chief of the Canadian
Secret Service at Ottawa, with the result
that extraordinary precautions have been
taken to safeguard the Weiland Canal
snd other border points. Every foot of
the waterway Is patrolled dey and night.

London, Feb. 7.?Great Britain? war
operations soon will be under the active
direction of Sir William Robertson, now
chief of stafT, according to widespread
tumor? tonight.
London generally accepts the report
that Ear] Kitchener will be superseded
as Secretary for War by a < ivilian.
Th* name of I-ord Derby is prominently
mentioned in this connection.
The rumors were given additional color
following official announcement that the |
King today received ln audience. '
Premier Asquith. Sir Henry Jackson ana
MaJ. Gen. Charles Klward Caldwell, all
prominent factors in Britain's military
policy.
Isrrplng ( hanitre* Km per ted .
Premier Asquith is president of the Im
perial Defense Committee; Gen. CaldweU
in director of Military Intelligence, and
Sir Henry Jackson Is First Sea Lord. It
Ih generally taken for granted that
sweeping changes soon ?ill be announced.
It is recalled that Bari Kitchener re
cent! ? was closeted with the King in
secret conference.
The Daily Sketch says Sir William
Robertson will be given powers that
will Insure him freedom from inter
ference, exrept from th? cabinet as a
whole It adds that Karl Kitchener
will undertake duties of a highly re
sponsible character elsewhere.
Some believe this portends the de
parture of the present secretary for
war for Saloniki, where immense op
erations are impending, or for the
held of operations even further east.
Provisions already have been made
for the grant of widely extended pow
ers to Robertson by an order !n coun
cil directing that he "be responsible
for issuing all orders of the govern
ment in regard to military opera
tion?."
Rnritral ?hange Likely.
Hitherto these ordeis have been Is
sued by the secretary for war. The
order in council Is clearly a prepara
tion for the separstion of the admin
istrative and executive functions of
the war secretary.
Sir William Robertson. K. C. V. O..
K. C. B.. B. 8. O., literally rose from
the ranks to chief of staff. He is
well known to the army itself, but the
outside world knows little of him. He
won his position by brave and distin
guished work in the Indian and South
African campaigns.
# Sir William Robertson went into
