Washington, Feb. 7. Approval has
not been given by President Wilson
and democrats of the senate are by
no means unanimously in favor of
amendments to the Colombian treaty
; reported last week by the senate for-
jeii?n relations couimitteo.
It developed today that a strong
I effort probably will be made in the
senate to defeat the changes which
would reduce the proposed indemnity
to Colombia for the partition of Pan
ama from 2o,000,tlU0 to $15,000,000
!and to revise the wording of the ex
pression of regret.
President litis Not ApproviHl.
Minister Iletancoutt, of Colombia,
called on Secretary U'lnsing during the
day and was assured that the presi
dent had not given his approval to
either of the amendments, later It
became known that many of the dem
ocrats of the foreign relations com
mittee opposed the changes.
A republican. Senator Smith, of
Michigan, by changing his vote on thu
tie in the committee carried the
amendment reducing the indemnity by
$10,000,000.
"I voted against the amendment
i first," said Senator Smith today, "be
cause 1 am opposed to the treaty. I
tn opposed to the United States pay
ing one dollar to Colombia. Hut when I
I saw how close the committee stood
on the issue, I concluded that $15,000,.
000 was $10,000,000 less than $25,000,
000 and I chungid toy vote. Now I
am glad of It, because 1 see it nas
