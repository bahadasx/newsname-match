Every mother realizes, after

ideal laxative because they love
its pleasant taste aud it thor
oughly cleanses tho tender little
stomach, liver and bowels with

When cross, irritable, feverish
or breath is bad, stomach sour,
look at the tongue, Mother! If
coated, give a teaspoonfnl of this
hirmless "fruit laxative," and in
a few hours all the foul, consti
pated waste, sour bile and undi
gested food passes out of the
bowelp, and you have, a well,
playful child again. When its
little system is full of cold, throat
sore, basatomach aehe, diarrhoea
inaigesuon, cone rememoor,
good "insido cleansing" should
always be the first treatment
given.
Millions of motheis keep "Cal

QUIETUS OF EFFORTS
TO SELL LIQUORS
Pembroke Dealers Are Given
Severe Blow by Assistant
Attorney General
Hopklnsvllle, Ky., Feb. C A rul
ing given by D. O. Myatt, assistant
attorney general of Kentucky, If a
oorreot view or the prohibition law
in this State, puts a quietus on the
effort of two Arms to secure license
to Bell liquor at Pembroke, which
has voted dry at two speolal elec
tions held In that territory. The
two firms have already filed notice
that they would apply to the Pem
broke town trustees for license, and
the matter is to come up for settle
ment next week.
Mr. Myatt'a letter, whioh succinct
ly sets forth the entire case, is:
Dear Sir: I have your letter in
which you say thdt on April 14, 1914,

tembar 21, 1014,an elootlonwas.held
in the county of Christian, in whioh
Pembroke Is located, and resulted in
a "wet" majority. On this state of
fact you desire an opinion as to
whether the result of the election in
Christian county would aulhorizo
the sale of liquor in Pembroke.
I beg-to advise that it Is myun
derstandlng of the law that the re
sult ot theeleotioa for the. county as
a whole will not have tho' effect to
authorize the sale of liquor in some
dlstrlot of the county that has pre
viously voted "dry1 under the local
option law, and therefore it would
not be lawful to lioense the sale of
liquor in the town of Pembroke.'

Beckham county, and finally ono
of them was passed, the bound
aries to be defined in tho bill. But
when the surveyors went to run
tho linos, thov found a marvel

to the bill creating it, Beck
ham county, Kentucky, crossed
the Ohio river aud ran to a point
sevoral miles into the State of
Ohio. It cut one Kentucky coun
ty in two, so that the people liv
ing in ono end of it would havo
to cross another county to get to
their own courthouse. It other
wise mutilated the map of two
states and infringed the right of.
the United States to the waters
of navigable streamB. The courts
held, of course, that the law was
fatally defective and there is no
Beckham couuty.
But that did uot deter other
legislatures from creatiug other

they made a tiew oue ad named
