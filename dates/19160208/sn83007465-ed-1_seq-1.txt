Senate Passes Bill, 52 to 24, to Give
Greater Degree of SelfDovcriiinpnt.
MEASURE CiOKS TO HOUSE Has
Harking of President and Will
He I^cssed for Early
m Passage.
Washington, Feb. 4.?The Philippine
bill, which would extend to
the islands a greater degree of selfgovernment,
and would authorize the
President to grant them absolue independence
within four years, passed
the Senate tonight, 52 to 24. Various
Democratic Senators, led by
Chairman Stone, of the foreign relations
committee, tried unsuccessfully
to amend certain features of the independence
clause, but in he end the
Democrats, Joined by six Progressive
Republicans, voted solidly for the
measure.
It is understood the bill will go to
the House with the backing of President
Wilson and will be pressed for
an early passage. Administration
leaders tonight seemed confident that
the bill, including the Independence
feature, which Democratic Senators
declare squares it with the Paltimore
platform, would have the nnnrovnl nf
the House Democratic majority.
The Republican Senators who voted
for the hill were: Rorah. Clapp.
Kenyon, Lafollette. Norris and
Works. Ry overwhelming majorities
the Senate refused to modify the
Clarke amendment, which contains
the independence provision, and also
Rives the President authority to extend
or withhold Independence at the
end of four years if he should And
conditions in the Islands unfavorable.
The time*would be extended,
however, only until an incoming
Congress could consider the subject.
Senator Stone declared the hill
was in reality not an independence
measure because of the extension
provision, and offered an amendment
to eliminate it. hut his proposal
**?- was voted down 60 to 17. Senator
Hitchcock, chairman of the Philippine
committee, sought to amend the
bill by extending Independence within
four years on condition that the
people and Legislature of the Philippines
should ratlfv a constitution.
This was rejected, 52 *o 25
"I am making a last anneal for
what I think is good faith and jus*
treatment of he Philippines," said
Senator Stone In urging his amend
ment. "I am unquestionably and
unconditionally in favor of cnrrylng
out the pledge of the Democratic
party by relinquishing control over
the Philippine Islands completely.
We are, in this bill, not offering independence
in fact, but merely a aug
gestlon of it to some future President."
Senator Norris, in opposing a proposition
in the hill empowering the
President to retain naval bases in
the PhlllnDineq. declared President
Wilsonn had been converted from n
man of peace to a militarist.
"The President." said Senator
Norris, "recently announced a pro^
gramme of preparedne-.s contrary to
views he held a year ago. and In the
last few days he has changed his
mind on that. Now he says he Is in
favor of the United States having the
largest navy In the world."
Senator William Alden Smith scored
the Democrats for their determination
to give up the Philippines and
declared the American people did not
wish to Bee the American flag over
the iBlands hauled down.
"This action is an unjustifiable
and uncalled for surrender of American
rights." he said. "If these islands
become anarchistic and the people get
to warring among themselves you
will be blamed for It. as you ought
to be. If other countries go to war
over them it will date from the day
when you cowards abandoned a taslr
which Providence placed In your
hands and which by this act you are
Acknowledging you are unanie to
master."
,8cnator Stone, replying, charncteri/.ed
Senator Smith'H remarks as a
"voclgeroua, scathing. dreary. Inane,
partisan harangue."
As passed the hill carries a provls^r
ion authorizing the President when
ind>i>< ndenoe is granted to negotlat
treaties to adjust all propery right'
of citizens of the United States an 1
? other countries in the islands, and to
acquire such naval base and coaling
stations within that territory a? he

UNCONSTITUTIONAL

Congressman llritt Tells Why He
V?te?l .Ignlnst the Measure in
The House
THIRD WIRE FROM CARTER
The Southern Textile Secretary Continues
to Find Fault With
the Measure.
Asheville, N. C., Feb. 5.?Congressman
James J. Rrltt, of the 10th
Congressional district, one of two1
Republican Congressmen who voted
against the Keating-Owen child la-1
bor bill, told the National Child Labor
Conference here tonight that he ;
opposed the Keating-Owen bill because
it was wholly unconstitutional
and an invasion of State rights. "I
lay my tribute at the feet of those of
work for the children," said Mr. |
Brltt. "They are good men and wo-1
men and my heart and energies are
with them In their work, hut the
Keating bill Is an undesirable waste
of efTort. I voted under my oath,
with another Republican out of 107
Republicans, and If 434 members of
teh 4 3g members of that great bodv
had voted for it, I should have voted
against it."
Paying his respect to Congressman
Keating, of Colorado, who was present
tonight and who will address the
conference tomorrow afternoon, Mr.
Rritt said:
"In the State of Colorado, the home
of the distinguished author of this
bill, there is out peace between capital
and labor. Within recent months
there the blood of laboring men, the
fathers of children, has flowed in
streams. While he reforms me and
mine, I commend him to the reformation
of himself and his. I challenged
my colleagues on the floor of the
House, hut challenged in vain and
now annul i-iiaiH'iigp .mi*. locating to
name an Instance where the Court
has ever held that Congress has the
right to regulate commerce in an
article such ae an Immaculate yard
of cloth, an article perfectly harmless,
healthy, sound ami normal.
re is where your law breads doIn
its constitutional validity."
<"n cross man Drift then turned
his attnetion to the conference, saving:
"I resent your making my Stat?the
brunt of your attacks. There are
no condllons here to warrant It. 1
do not. claim that we have done all we
could do, but wc are moving. Great
reforms do not come in a day. The
problems are ours and we are equal
to them. Leave us to solve them."
Other speakers tonight were Drt
Samuel McCune Linndsay, vice chairman
of the national child labor committee,
New York, who sketched the
source of the Keating-Owen hill;
Wylie M. Swift, Greensboro, secretary
for the Cnrolinas, who discussed
"The Two Views of Child Protection."
and Dr. A. J. McKelway, secretary
for the Southern States, who spoke
on "The South for Child Labor Reform."
The heart of the South is
for abolishing the evils of child labor.
Dr. McKelway said.

Columbia. Feb. 5.?Emergency
funds of $50,000 for the enforcement
of the prohibition law and $25,000
for the payment of the shortage in
militia equipment were placed in the
appropriation bill yesterday morning
after a long and heated debate, In
the course of which charges wer?
made that there had been a coalition
I of prohibitionists and militia supporters
in getting the amendments
passed. An eleventh hour attempt
| which developed also a split in the
[ hitherto solid committee on ways and
means, was made to have these two
funds turned into a direct appropriation;
this failed, however.
At 2:15 o'clock the general appropriation
bill was given a second reading
and the "clincher" put on. The
bill had been under consideration
continuously through Ave sittings of
the house and though the ways and
means committee carried practicp'ly
: all of its contentions and voted down
j conflictinc amendments, the hill had
i a stormy passage. Notice was given
| of ceneral amendments on third read
inc. consisting principally of change?
in totals and the recapitulation.
i The creation of the two emergenc\
' funds was the object of prolongei
discussion. The law enforcement
I fund, which is to be drawn from b\
mi- governor oniy when condition,
justify or require extraordinary
measures, was passed on a yea an*
nay vote of 53 to 35; the militit
shortage fund of $25,000 was decree*
on a yea and nay vote of 64 to .3 0
with the provision that the money

Breaks in Arkansas Itiver Levees
Disastrous to Large Section.
ltlVKK STILL RISINU
Mississippi Also t'ontiniies to Rise
and Breaks in Levees Are
Feared.
Little Rock, Feb. G.?The rapidly
widening lake in southeastern Arkansas,
formed by the flood waters of
| the Arkansas River pouring through
breaks in the levees, had engulfed a
score of towns tonight, leaving several
thousand persons homeless.
Sixteen lives have been lost in the last
few days, and damage that probably
will run into hundreds of thousands
I of dollars has resulted in the rich
farming territory.
( Still greater damage is feared if
the Mississippi continues to rise as
i in the last few days. Predicated
, stages at Arkansas City would endanger
the levees there and a break
in the Missippi levees would precipitate
a serious situation in the
river valley.
All day the 700 men who remained
in Arkansas City toiled in an effort
to strengthen the levees against the
fast rising waters and tonight they
were hopeful thai the levees would
i,r.ta ? -
......i nun mi' town bo saved. Tho
narrow -trip of ! voo is th- only land
in sight thoro. On one side is tho
river, swollen, until its surface is i">
foot ahovo the ! vol of the town. On
the other side of the levee is the
great flood lake nearly 40 miles lone
' and 20 miles wide. From it only the
upper stories of buildings In Arkansas
City protrude. At the levee are
three steamboats, one of which is
ready to carry the workers to safetv
should they lose their battle with tho
flood. They are living iti the second
stories of their homes and in box
cars on the levee.
Today the river rose two-tenths of
r foot, to "t'.T feet at Arkansas City,
j and is still rising slo-vly tonight.
At I.."ke Village the flood water
rose at the rate of half an inch an
hour today \t Giim t Landing, four
mile-- north >f Lake ViLap. . 4"i) p. ioo
were on tho l. yee tonight without
shelter !! -blent of Lake Vi 1
lac- went in 'mats to the ourt hous 1
today where they planned to send a ?
rescue fleet of row boats to Gaines
Landing.
In Clarendon, on the White River,
where the levee broke last night water
today is six feet in the highest
portions of the town. The r'ver had
attained a stage of .17.4 feet and still
is rising. Little is known of conditions
in the rural districts of the
flooded area, but there seems litfTe
doubt that many who refused o leave
their homes in face of repeated warnings
have perished.
Fred J. Henry of Washington,
meterologist in charge of the river
and flood division of the Fnited States
Weather bureau, who is in Little
Rock, declared that a condition similar
to that which now exisits in Arkansas
has never before occurred in
the history of the Weather Bureau.
"Heavy snow followed by thaw and
heavy rains in Illinois and ottmr
Northern States has caused a rise in
the upper Mississippi River.'' lie said.
"The ni.m " * *
, -wi> uootied in its power
course .and general rains in the valleys
of the Arkansas, Red, White and
other tributaries of the Mississippi
have tlooded the latter river until it
will require to run out. The swollen
condition of the Mississippi has made j
the Arkansas River flood much mnr"
disastrous than it otherwise would
have been.'' |
