OEffi FLEET
CONTRADICTS ADMIRAL FLETCH
ER ON ATLANTIC SHIPS' PER
SONNEL ADVOCATES ADDING
TO NAVAL ACADEMY,
Washington, Feb. 7. When Rear
Admiral Blue, chief of the bureau
of navigation, told the house naval
committee Monday that tiie Atlantic

an excess of nearly 2ui) men in its

lacked oil) coal passers, G7 machinists'
mates, IS gunners' mates, 32 boat
swain's mates, fi: electricians, tJO yeo
men and 41 ships' cooks.

excess of men in other ratings, how
ever," replied Admiral Blue, reiter
ating his statement that the fleet
had from 1.30 to 200 men in excess
of its total allowed enlisted comple
ment when it started.
"Admiral ' Fletcher has said the
fleet was short 3,000 enlisted men
last year."
"Have you ever commanded a bat
tleship?" demanded Representative
Britten.
"Xo," said Admiral Blue, "but I
have been executive officer of an ar
mored cruiser, and the executive of
ficer deals directly with the assign
ment and employment of the men.
The work is exactly the same on an
armored cruiser as on a battleship."
The admiral, after stating that the
navy on July 1, 1919, will be short
l.rro officers of the force necessary
to man its ships foi war, urged

SEVERAL MATTERS OF IMPORT
ANCE WILL BE UP FOR DISCUS
SiON AT REGULAR MEETING OF
COMMISSIONERS TONIGHT.
At the regular meeting of the board
of city commissioners tonight there
are several matters of importance to
be considered by the board. One of
the principal tilings to be discussed
is the apparent abuse of the power
granted to hack drivers and jitney bus
owners. There is a law en the stat
ute books of the city covering this
que-tion and fixing tiie charges that
may be made for service within the
corporate limits of the city, but from
recent reports it has been learned that
certain drivers ure taking advantage
of the fact that the general public is
not wise to the proper charge and
are shaking them down for all they
think they will stand. The fare fixed
by law Is 25 cents for any distance un
der nine blocks, for any distance over
this, or to the city limits drivers are
allowed to collect fifty cents, but there
is no law that will permit them to
collect a dollar which is frequently
done and in one or two Instances
much more than that amount for
rides within the corporate limits of
the city.
Tli mayor and commissioners will
discuss this matter tonight and If they
can secure proper evidence against
these drivers who are too prone to
exact extortionate prices, their license
to do business in the city will be re
voked altogether.
Since the number of Jitney busses
has Increased to such proportion with
in the past year, it is necessary to
keep in keen competition with each
other in order to get along, but tiie
mayor says he can see no reason why
the public at large should be made to
pay the freight.

HEAVY DOCKET WILL BE READY
FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF
THE COURT. MANY CASES AD
DED BY COURT OF INQUIRY.
District court will convene in this
city February "S, according to a call
issued by Judge Freeman today. A
jury has been ordered drawn and die
coining session promises to be one of
the most interesting held since state
hood. The regular January term
which was to have convened the first
of last month, was postponed on ac
count of the desire of the court to
probe certain conditions said to exist
in the oil field towns. This invvestlga
tiou has resulted in many more names
being added to the regular docket
and some genuine surprises are looked
for when the docket is culled.
The court of Inquiry is still in ses
sion and it is announced by the court
that it will remain at work until the
day before the district court convenes.
A mass of evidence has been accumu
lated and many summonses and war
rants have been Issued by the county
attorney.
It Is officially reported that moral
conditions in the oil field district have
vastly improved since the court took
it upon itself to Investigate, many of
the old timers who were constantly
defying the law, have departed, and
rough-neck element generally lias
cnttered to other places.

IF ONE IS TO BE BUILT BY LOCAL
CAPITAL, THE PROMOTERS ARE
SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT.
HOTEL BADLY NEEDED.
There has not been a word said
aliout the new hotel in over a week
and it is beginning to look as if the
promoters of the hotel plan recently
advanced have given up hope of
erecting it by local capital and are
now waiting for some one from other
places to come forward and invest
their money here.
Ardmore needs another hotel, and
needs it badly, but unless the local
committee get busy, the chances are
that another year will have passed
before the doors of a modern hostelry
are thrown open to the public. The
local hotel committee appointed by
the chamber of commerce, have not
made a report since the last noon
day luncheon, but it Is reported that
they will have something to say when
the chamber of commerce next con
venes. Captain Wliittington has let
it be definitely know that he would
not rebuild a hotel, and if one is
erected soon, either local capitalists
or outsiders will have to take charge
of it.
