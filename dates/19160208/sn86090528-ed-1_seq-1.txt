No Secrecy Attempted; Will Show How
All Funds Were Expended, Says Chair
ma iCnrzine; Robinson Hands
Jurors Slight Jolt
According to statements given out
by the commissioners of the county
of Grady, a statement retarding .the
clause in the report of the grand Jury
censuring the commissoiners for the
manner in which the road, work in cer
tain parts of the county has been
done, will be ready in a few days,
1 roperly prepared by members of the
lomml.sison and setting forth in de
tail all the particulars about the con
struction of tho work.
In speaking of the matter this morn
ing J. A. Corzlno, chairman of tha
board of commissioners, said, "I have
liot read the report of tho grand jury.
However, I have been told of the re
port and have been told that that hou
erable body has seen fit to reflect
i:pon tho manner in which this com
lnipslon has built certain pieces of
road. I shall investigate the report
of the grand jury, that is I shall study
it thoroughly and then make a re
port showing the people just how
every cent of the money on roads hna
been expended. In this connection
I would like to state that there has
Lxen at no time any attempted se
creey In this matter, tha matter has
been open and above board In every de
tail ami all nets of the commissioners
Lave been made a part of the county'
records and as such records belong to
the public and are open for the inspec
tion of any one."
V. A. Bryant, commissioner from
the northern district, stated that ho
cared to say nothing in the m.Uter to
day. Mr. Bryant reiterated the state
ment of Chairman Corxlne, however,
in that the proceedings of the commiR
Uoiiers were a part of the public re
cord and as such open for the read
ing and the Inspection of every one
in Grady county. "We have done noth
ing which we care to hide," said Mr.
Bryant.
,T. a. Robinson, member of the com
missioners' board from the central,
or Chickasha district, staled that he
cored to say nothing at the present
timo "1 suppose," said Mr. Robinson,
"this report may be looked upon by
those who do not like the way things
have been run since I have been a
member of the board of commission
ers, ns a personal attack on me. I
wish to reiterate what Chairman Cor
lne has said, that all doings of the
hoard of commissioners in road build
ing as In every other line, have been
open. Everything done has been made
a part of the record and as such is
open to inspection of every one in the
Plate at large, as well as to every
one In C.rady county. This board has
played no favorites In any manner
and In any form. At the proper time
we shall publish a full and complete
tevlew of the manner in which the
road work, to which tho slap of the
grand Jury's report alludes, showing
liow every penny was spent and who
drew those pennies.
"In tho meanwhile, before we do
this, it might be well i t s4ate that ten
memhera of the inquistorial body, the
grand Jury of Grady county, Okla
homa, drew pay In the sum of $2 each
ior serving tho county as such grand
jurors on tho 10th day of January,
:i'l6. A glance at tho calendar will
1,0 w you that the Kith of January fell
on Sunday and a little investigation
will further show you that the grand
jury was not in session on that date.
This money was paid to the ten jurors
claiming attendance, through the o.
fice of the court clerk and the duty of
Hie board of commissioners of Grady
county is to see that the ones who
drew this amount, money to which
thov were not entitled, shall be call
i.h nnnn to Jar loose and reimburse
the county."

have ever had the good fortune to

by Captain
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
(United Press Staff Correspdoncent.)
LONDON, Jan. 23. (By Mail.)
A story that rivals fiction has reach
ed London from a remote section of
the Shetland iblands.
A mother, watching over her sick
child in a cottage on the shore of a
sea inlet, saw a German U-boat sub
merge i nthe channel way. During the
day the doctor had called, saying that
a British warship was expected to
anchor in the inlet before many hours,
'i'his meant peril to the 800 lives of
the crew of the battleship.
Leaving her child alone in the cot
tage, the mother made her way to
I he poatoffice and reported what she
had seen. Returning quickly to the
side of the child, she found it dead.
Before long a British mine sweep
ed entered the inlet. As it did so th;
rubmarine came to the surface. There
was a sharp fight. The mine sweeper
gave a plunge: and wentd own. Boat-
from the shore rescued the
drowning crew.
The submarine prepared to depart.
When it reached the outward head
land it came face to face wilh the
British warship. Another battle en
ued and the submarine was damaged
and captured. On board the U boat
was Mangus Laurensen, husband of
the heroic mother whose baby had
died. Laurensen had been captured
the day before when the submarine
sank his ship.
Laurensen and his wife that same
afternoon sat in their cottage brood
ing over the death of their child, yet
happy that the father himself hari
been spared. A knock sounded at the
door. The captain of the battleship
was ushered in. He warmly congrat
ulated Mrs. Laurensen for her hero
ism, asking:
"Will you accept an immediate in
stallment of your reward?"
"As you please," she answered.
The captain turned to the door. As
he did so, .a British jacktar entered
holding at arms lenght a flaxen
haired, blue-eyed infant.
"Will you adopt him?'' asked the
captain.
The husband and wife readily and
willingly assented.
The child, concludes the story, had
teen rescued from a British stsamer
which had fallen a pre yto a sub
rine. BUSINESS IN
