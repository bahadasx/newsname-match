Secretary Lansing to Lay Bo

Berlin Proposals For Settle-
t ment of Controversy.
Arrangements Made For Con
ference Following Brief
Meeting of Cabinet At the
White House.
President Wjlsons answer to
the latest proposal from Berlin
for a settlement of the Lusitania
controversy will be laid before
Courit von Bernstorff this after
noon by Secretary of State Lan
sing. Arrangements to that end
were made following the Cabinet
meeting.
Although it was stated that it
was unlikely that a definite an
nouncement would be made today
the statement is expected within
the next twenty-four hours.
Officials at the White House
are optimistic. They describe the
situation as "hopeful." It is stated
that it may not be necessary to
have any further exchanges be
twe$h the twd govcrnmentsbefore
'n sett'lenterit is Yeached
SHORT CABINET SESSION.
The Cabinet meeting was Ann of the'
shortest' held in some time. Discussion
of the Lustanla Issue was brief, but
sufficient to show that the Cabinet
members approved the position of the
President. All of the members ex
pressed optimism as they left the Whlto
House
Previous to the meeting the President
and Secretary Lansing held an hour's
conference at the White House.
The Germany ambassador confidently
expects a .cettlemont before the end of
the week. He has gone so far as to
itill some of his friends that a settle
ment practically has been effected.
From administration quarters, how
er, the hint is thrown out that there
may be other exchanges. There is a
disposition in some quarters to believe
that Count Von Uernstorff has some
thing further up his sleeve which would
meet the exact language tho United
States wishes put Into the agreement.
Secretary Lansing, on his way to the
White House, refused to comment on
the probable attitude of the United
States. He seemed more Interested in
the weather.
"It must be awful cold in the
tienches," he said.
America's Demand.
The chief point "on which the United
States Is Insisting Is thai the German
government shall acknowledge that tho
sinking of an unresisting merchantmen,

national law. Germany litis made an

In tho Arabic note ot rieptcmoer i, tho

conduct that were considered ns satis
lactory when it said that "liners will
not be sunk by our submarines without
wumpg and without safety ot tho lives
of non-combatants, provided tnat the

Committee Favorably Reports
Tillman Bill Despite Fac
tories' Threats,
BODY WARNED BY, PENROSE
Price of Plate Will Be Increased
If Measure Passes, He De
' dares.
I T - Senate Naval Affairs Committee
toanv voted In favor of Government
tim-ufnnture of armor plate, nnd order
ed "e Tlllmann armor plate factory
0 1 -eporteTI favorably, by 9 to 3.
At the samo time, the two naval bills
i ii passed the House yesterday af
pyi .on were ordered reported. One bill
inn hhp the number of cadets nt Arf
i nft'Ola nnd the other provides for Im
nr oments at New York and Mare
'l n'l yards so as to fnellltato con
slruction of new dreadnaughts.
An uglv war betwerri Government and
nrmnr nlRtp Interests may be precipi
tated as the result of what some of the
committee regard as an effort of the
armor plat companies to hold up the
Government. Senator Penrose served
notice on the committee that he had
o'n informed that If the Government
went Into the armor plate business at
nil. tho private companies would all get
out eventually, and would require the
Government to pay Sino a ton moo r
armor for the contemplated naval pro
gram In order to rreate an amortiza
tion fund
Would Mean $24,000,000.
A tin' ' Government will need about
120.f tons- of armor for its live-year
program, the threatened increase would
mean J2t.000.ooo added expense.
This threat not only did not deter the
committee from action, but Senator
Tillman clearly rpsented It. He said
ft asa good thing to remember.
The Government hns th power of
eminent domain," he said, "and If It
be"omc t necessary can condemn 'tho
private pfuntH." .
' no sold the threat t Increase
(In" fjt ai-ifinr plain afforded" all
the rroit renson for the Govornment
to net U'llokly.
"The 'loverninpnt might to ge,t Into
tl.e biixinetis Just as quick as it can,"
he said.
He added that he would press the
aimor plate bill for passage as
fctrongly as possible.
As to" the bill to increase cadets at
Annapolli nnd the bill for Improve
ments amounting to J100.000 at the
lirooklvn navy yard, and 5500.000 at
Mare Island yard, these were reported
to the Senate thjs afternoon by Sen
ator Tillman and prompt action arked
for. This was by Instruction of the
commltte
Action of the rommlttee is considered
htehlv significant of tho fact that Senate
Naval Committer sentiment, as well
as Senate sentiment. Is overwhelmingly
In favor of BJTnrffness. and at the
same time that It is strong for Govern
ment manufacture of war materials.
May Purchase Plant.
It Is possible the Government will pur
chase one or more of tho big armor
Plnte plants now existent. That Is. It
might purchase tho Bethlehem plant,
the Mldvale plant or the Carnegie plant.
Senator Tillman, chairman of the com
mittee, pointed out that onlv the Bethle
hem and the Mldvale had been repre
sented before the committee.
Coming right on the heels of the senti
ment' manifested In the House yester
day when It ttassed the two naval bills
before It. the action of the Senate com
mittee has created a, profound Impres
sion. It can be het down ns conclusively
demonstrated that the skies are clearing
for n national defense program.
The armor plate factory bill was
amende so as to authorize the Secre
tary of the Navy to purchase or erect
a factory or factories for manufacture
of armor, the totul annual capacity to
be not less than 20.000 tons.
The appropriation carried Is $11,000,000.
ITnder the amendment the Secretary of
the Nnvy could buy one plant and build
one; could buy two or could build two
as he saw fit. While he could provide
for a slnglo factory of 20,000 ton ca
pacity. It is suld by experts that two
will bo needed.

IDENTIAL
Great Britain Thinks a "Colonel
House" Might Lead to Un
derstanding. 1XJNDON. Feb. 8. President Wilson's
scheme of sending a confidential diplo
matic envoy abroad has won such com
mendation that Kngland is considering
send'ng a "Colonel House" of her own
tn America, it was reported today.
The foreign office, it was reported. it
considering sending a skilled diplomat,
well acquainted In America, to Wash
ington to present fresh views from Eng
land, just as Colonel House has ac
quainted American ambassadors abroad
and foreign officials with American of
flclal and unofficial sentiment.
Such a course. It is believed, may
smooth out some of the present difficul
ties over lir'tlsh blockude regulations.

SAYS REFERENDUM
Senator Sheppard Says Real
Purpose of Vote Is to Kill

The situation In the Senate today rel

ore in an attitude of "watchgul wait
ing." It is admitted In nil quarters that If
the bill Is not recommitted the real test
Is going to center about the proposition
to amend the bill by providing Tor a
referendum.
That tho vote on the proposed refer
endum will bo close Is expected both by
the opponents of the bill and Its advo
vates. Senator Sheppard said today the real
purpose of the referendum was to kill
prohibition In the District and defeat
the bill. He does not regard It possible,
without adequate machinery, to have a
real election In Washington.
"There is no nuestlon of the purpop
of tho referendum movement." said
Senator Sheppard. "It is Intended to
kill prohibition In the District."
Senator Sheppard doos not deny there
will bo a close situation with resDect to
tho referendum, riut he declares iho
majority of the benate will vote for the
bill If a test comes on tho straight ques
tion of passage as it stands.
it developed today that some members

classed as foes of prohlblt'on brcauso
they intend to work tor a referendum,

Senator Sheppard has conferred with
representatives of the druggists. He i
hns consented to make such minor
changes. In the bill aH will meet their
wishes. One clmnge which he has
agreed to Is to strlko out tho provision
that a druggist' hns to present an aftl- '

Report of Secretary of Treasury
to Conferees on Deficiency
Bill Scores Foes of Heat
Plant Site.
Declares Fine Arts Commission
Criticisms Are Not in Ac
cordance With the Facts In
the Case. v
"The worst offenders against
Washington's sky line, arc the two
huge black stacks of the Potomac
Electric Power Company, which
ribe to an elevation of 200 feet
above Pennsylvania avenue and
the Mall."
This declaration was made by
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo
today in a report to the conferees
on the urgent deficiency bill, who
are considering the power plant
project.
In the report, requested by Sen
ator Martin, after the conferees
had visited the site of the central
heating, lighting and power plant
which is in controversy, the Sec
retary calls attentions -that defeat
of the Government project might
mean enlargement of the plant
which he characterized as the
worst offender against the sky
line. .
ISSUE WITH CRITICS.
t The pOvr company's proposal to en
large Its plant to supply steam to the
Government, he declared, contemplated
an Investment of $200,000. which tho Gov
ernment would eventually have to tako
over In enlargement of the Mf.ll area,
thus having a plant ndjacent to tho
Mall. The Secretary intlnmtes that thla
would probably transplte If the power
plant project Is killed.
Tilt Secretary says that the agency
which has prompted opposition to th
power plant project is unknown to him.
He transmit), draninga and photographs
to demonstrate that tho new plant
would be Invisible from W per cent oj
the observation points from which tho
Fne Arts Commission said It uould bo
a blot.
Taking shary issue with clitics of tho
plant's location at Thirteenth and
Water streets southwest, mi cathotlo
grounds, tho Secretary declares that
an audacious effort has been made to
nrouse resentment against an alleged
effort to outrago estnetKj sensibilities.
on false grounds.
Secretary McAdoo visited tth site of
tho power plant late yesterda, and
after nn Inspection dccljred thai oppo
sition to such a site for the power
plant was preposterous, us tuiv modern
building would Improve It.
The Secretary takes pointed issue
-with tho-e who havo assailed the plant
on esthetic grounds.
Mr. McAdoo's Report.
