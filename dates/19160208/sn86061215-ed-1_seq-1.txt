GERMANY ADMITS

Phraseology of Note
From the Kaiser
Washington, D. C., Feb. 7.—
Germany has agreed that repris
als must not be directed against'
any other than enemy subjects,
his expression Is offered by Ger
many to take the place of the
phrase containing the word
"Illegal," which was Incorporated
In the draft of the Lusitanla
agreement now under considera
tion.
It also became known that Ger
many expresses the hope that It
may have the opportunity to co
operate with the United States In
some action looking toward the
freedom of the seas before the
end of the war. This statement
is taken In high diplomatc circles
to Imply that the Berlin govern
ment sees no occasion to await
the cessation of hostilities before
settling that Issue.
Furthermore, the German gov
ernment refers to the British
blockade of Germany as being In
humane, calls attention to the
fact that neutral vessels have
been affected by the efforts of the
British government to starve
Germany, and puts forth the con
tention that the German retalia
tion In the war zone around the
British isles Is justified by the
actions of Great Britain. Claims
that the reprisals are legal are
not mentioned.
As has been previously stated,
Germany says in the communica
tion that the killing of citizens of
the United States was without
Intent and that the method of
conducting warfare in the North
sea has been changed out of re
gard for the long standing friend
ship between the United States
and Germany and because Ameri
can lives were lost
Washington, D. C., Feb. 7.—Secre
tary Lansing today flatly denied that
new demands had been made in the
Lusitanla case at a time when the
German government considered the
negotiations practically were at an

Bet forth In the notes of May 13, June
mermann's statement was published
In this country, however, his reference
to new demands was taken to apply
to a possible construction on the word
"illegal" in the proposed form of set
tlement. The only ground American
officials could find for construing that
as embodying a new demand was the
possibility that it might be considered
applicable not alone to the destruction
of neutrals on the Lusitania, but also
as to the method by which she was
sunk.
Secretary Lansing said he expected
to confer with President Wilson today.
He made it known, however, that the
state department considered the situa
tion unchanged.
Case "Practically Settled."
Chairman Stone of the senate for
eign relations committee said after
talking with administration officials
that his impression was the Lusitania
case was "practically settled." He
did not go into details. Secretary
Lansing, however, indicated that some
announcement might be given out
within the next few days.
There was no indication whether
the president had definitely decided
whether Germany's latest proposal
was satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
Administration officials let it be
known that a mere choice of words
would not be permitted to stand in
the way of success of the negotiations
and that the United States will not
insist on the use of the word "illegal"
or "disavowal" in Germany's acknow

Chicago, Feb. 7. "We are not sur
prised at the statement of Sir Edward
Grey, England's secretary of foreign
affairs, that his country cannot permit
shipment of food to Poland under pre

Mr. Smulski, who has represented
American Polish organizations in ne
gotiations regarding relief for Poland,
expressed the belief, however, that in

themselves as to make possible the
sending of foodstuffs to the people of
that war stricken country.
"England asks what is right and fair
she should ask of us. Germany is will

COL. HEPBURN IS
CULLED BY DEATH
WELL KNOWN FORMER CON-
GRESSMAN FROM IOWA DIES
AFTER EXTENDED ILLNESS.
Clarinda, Feb. 7.—Col. William P.
Hepburn, former member of congress
from this district, died here today af
ter a long illness.
Col. William P. Hepburn, although
twenty years in congress, became best
known throughout the country during
the Roosevelt administration. It was
he who framed what later was called
the Hepburn law, prohibiting rebates
and discrimination by railroads. As
chairman of the house committee on
interstate and foreign commerce in
the first session of the fifty-ninth con
gress he was the author of three acts
out of five which the then President
Roosevelt afterward declared would
cause that congress to be memorable
in history because of Its constructive
legislation. Of the five acts, four
came from Col. Hepburn's committee
and three of them—the Hepburn law,
the pure food act and the public
health act—were framed by Col. Hep
burn himself.
Mr. Hepburn represented the eighth
Iowa district. He also was an effici
ent soldier in the Civil war and a
lakyer of high reputation. He was a
product of the early pioneer days of
Iowa and got what little schooling he
had in three winters at an academy
near Iowa City. He was born in Co

1833.

COMMITTEE IS

Commercial Association to
Investigate Means of
Reorganization
NEW INDUSTRIES
ARE BONUS HUNTERS
[Factory Projects Viewed
as Detriment By Some
May Change Title
The plan for the reorganization of
the Ottumwa Commercial association
along the most approved lines followed
In cities the size of Ottumwa all over
the country are progressing nicely ac
cording to the statement m)ade today
by a member of the committee in
charge of this particular work.
"Before starting on the actual work
given us," said this man, "we made a
thorough investigation of the charac
ter of organization and the methods
of work followed by chambers or com
merce and commercial clubs through
out the United States. This investi
gation has taken several months and
Involved a tremendous amount of cor
respondence as well as clerical work
and tabulation of results on the part
of the committee. We now feel, how
ever, that we have the matter well in
hand and have the benefit of a varied
experience on the part of, others to
guide us in the reorganization plans
for our own association.
"It is needless to say that we have
gotten many new ideas In methods
and in plans for interesting a large
number of members In the actual work
of the association. On the other hand
we found it a general trend of opinion
among all commercial clubs that their
spheres of activity in civic life were
getting away from the purely commer
cial and coming to include all matters
o,f general community interest. Many
organizations put the matter blunty
t$at they bad been wasting their time
and accomplishing little good for their
cities while they confined their efforts
Btrictly to the getting of new indus
tries.
"One man wrote 'ninety-nine out of
every hundred factories that want to
move from their present location are
simply bonus hunters and are more
of a detriment than benefit to any com
munity the hundredth one, if it comes
at all, will come for business reasons,
and will require no more bonus than
a hearty welcome by the people of
your city.'
"I mention the above matter merely
to support the conclusion which our
own commercial association reached
some time ago. The true mission of
the modern commercial club is to rep
resent the community and the citizens
In every civic field, not only commer
cial but governmental, philanthropic
and economic as well. The change has
even been recognized in some cixies
by a change of name on the part of
the organization, the word "commer
cial' being eliminated in the title in
favor of 'communal," 'civic,' 'commun
ity' or other similar phrasing. Whether
this should be done here has not been
decided, although the association
would be glad to hear opinions of
members and citizens on this point."

Des Moines, Feb. 7.—A. E. Kepford,
former state tuberculosis lecturer,

When Mr. Kepford resigned a year
ago as lecturer for the state, the posi

were many applicants for the place.
The job carries a salary of $2,000 a

The evangelistic work into which
Mr. Kepford went when he left the

that he go back to hls ^l^ fij&ld.
