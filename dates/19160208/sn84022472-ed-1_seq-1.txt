process of refining oil, was lootoed up
on with great favor. :

Which he never utilized because ,of
the foreign competition, but since the
war started, he saw an opportunity to
-make a fortune because of the scarcity
of dye material, and recently he plan
ned to manufacture again. ; Death cut
short his plans. ' "

KITCHENER TO GO
TO EGYPT, LONDON
PAPER DECLARES
London, Feb. 8. The Weekly World
says it hears that Field Marshal Lord
Kitchener is likely to take over com
mand of the British forces in Egypt
and that the Earl of Derby, the direc
tor of recruiting, will be the new sec
retary of state for war with a seat In
the cabinet. !
The World gives no authority for
the report, but says it is gossip In line
with recent intimations that Earl
Kitchener might withdraw from the
war ministry to assume more active
duties.
Lord Derbyi has just returned to
London from a visit to the British
forces operating in Flanders.

The threat of the armor barons to
hold up the government will not affect
Congress" said Senator Tillman. "We
were given to understand that, the ar
mor manufacturers would - increase
their, price because government manufacture-
of armor plate would force
them- to go out of that business and
they would charge this enormous in
crease in order to provide themselves
ah amortisation fund. But I. guess
we can find a way to stop the robbers.
In time of trouble we could seize their
plants and operate them by right of
eminent domain."
After brief consideration the com
mittee favorably reported the bill au
thorizing expenditure of $500,000 to
equip Mare. Island'navy yard for bat
tleship construction and $100,000 to
enlarge facilities of the New York
