LONDON. Feb. s. That Germany
'.:;. determined to coirlmt the ef
t(ct of t!ie allies' diplomacy in UoU-
- nit with a vast military denmn
stration Is reported in dispatches
from A nistonl un and Geneva today.
These advices say that th- Ger
mans may .'ttenipt the most ambi
tious enterpiise of the war a triple
offensive. l'orsnie time vast num
bers of trops and an enormous
amount of fresh artillery has been
m.'i.ssefi on the western front and on
the Greek frontier and now it is re
ported t li :t the G rman war office
is preparing for a scries of attacks
against the Russians.
A Bu hares dispatch says that
hostilities have been resumed by the
Russians in Bukowina, but weather
conditions throughout the entire
asten theater have been so incle
ment for weeks that lighting on a
big .",;,!:' eould not be attempted by
'ither side.
From the Baltic to the southern
ranees of the F.trpatuians there
have been blizzards, leaving the
loads and mountain passes buried
beneath mountains of snow. The
t heremorneter registers from zero to
.'b or more ilesrces below.
In Macedonia, and Albania a. sim
ilar state of affairs has hindered a
big forward movement by either
.-iile. but advantage has been taken
.f the lull to make pel' para t ions for
an advance when conditions become
more favorable.
If Germany undertakes an offen
sive movement in ali three theaters
f war simultaneously it will be one
of the most gigantic enterprises ever
attempted in this or ar. other war.
It is beüeed that Germany, Aus

International New Service:
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. S.
Twenty-nine deaths have resulted
from the unprecedented Hood condi
tions in Arkansas and northern
Louisiana, according to the latest ad
vices received here today.
Add I to the horror of the Hood,
an epidemic of typhoid was threat-I
ened today In Clarendon, Ark. A
telegram received in Frinkley, Ark., j
requested that every available phy
sician in the town be sent immed
iately to Clarendon lo check the
disease. The sewerage system of
Clarendon has caved in, and the
Hooded sections of the town, where
more than 700 men, women and
children are marooned in building
lofts, were lakes of filth.
Provisions in the town have been
exhausted. The last bread and meat
was distributed Monday. The refu
gees, weakened by hunger, are very
susceptible to disease.
Hi mil y Found Dead.
A negro family, father, mother
and six children, marooned in the
top floor of their home on the edge
of Clarendon, had nothing to eat
since Saturday. Late yesterday a
15-year-old son of the family broke
into a flooded grocery, stole six cans
of sardines and the family ate them.
Today all were found dead by a
rescue party.
Messages from Lane Village and
Arkansas City today stated that the
suffering among Hood victims was
terrible. The Mississippi river was
rising steadily and the only land in
sight is the small section of the
main levee that was left standing.
Dr. John Griscom, of Bedford,
Ark., wired today for aid, stating
that a large number of persons will
perish In and around Arkansas City
unless help reaches them today.
The fight to save the main levee of
the Mississippi river wall was kept
up all last night. Their efforts,
thus far, have saved the city from
destruction.
Levee Threatening.
At Natchez, Miss., the levee was
threatening to break today. Water
was seeping through in several
places. The city itself jas not in
danger, but a break in the levee
would isolate it from the rest of the
world.
Lieh plantations in Carroll parish.
Louisiana, were coered by water
today. More than 15 towns in that
parish have water standing in their
streets.
White river has receded consider
ably, and the work of clearing away
debris in Newport, Ark., was well
under way today. The greatest pre
dicted danger today was in the
neighborhood south of Helena, Ark.,
where the most serious Hood in the
history of the Mississippi valley was
anticipated.

Men Will Not be Ready For

Summer.
international News service:
lA'NDOX, Feb. S. Four groups
of Kngiish army recruits enlisted
under the Lord Derby scheme, be
gan reporting to tho colors today.
These men will m't h? ready for ac
tive service until summer, however,
as they will be given from three t
live months' training before being
sent lo the lield of war.
It is estimated that the British
army will be increased by approx
imately a quarter of a million men
by the calling out of these recruits.
The four groups that began re
porting today were: No. il, aged 2'.',;
No. 7. aged HI; No. S. aged 25; No.
9, aged 2.
With the men who began report
ing today eight groups of recruits
that attested under the Derby
scheme have been called out f"r
service. All ar- single men.
In order to avoid inconvenience
and undue pressure upon the recruit
ing offices, it was arranged that only
a certain number of men should be
required to report today, but from
now on until the four groups are ex
hausted the recruits will continue to
present themselves.
There was a big rush of Derby vol
unteers today to enroll themselves
before the conscription bill goes
into effect on Thursday. By attest
ing before Thursday the recruits
save themselves from the stigma of
