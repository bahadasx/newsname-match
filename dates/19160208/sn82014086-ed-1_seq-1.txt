Nothing new has come through con
cerning the reported concentration of
troops of the Teutonic allies in the

BEFORE CABINET TODAY
Latest Communication from Germany
Is to be Considered.
Washington, Feb. 7 president -WH
sen will talie-nup' with his cabinet to
morrow the latest draft of the pro
posed communication which Germany
hopes will bring the negotiations over
the Lusitania disaster to a termina
tion satisfactory to the United States.
Official indication or announcement
whether the offer of the Berlin gov
ernment is satisfactory is expected
soon thereafter.
The president did not request Secre
tary Lansing to come to the White
House for a conference today and the
conference which had been planned
did not matetrialize. The secretary
expects to discuss the latest proposal
with the -president tomorrow and it is
believed , in Teutonic diplomatic cir
cles that Count Von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, may be summon
ed to the state department some time
during' the afternoon and informed of
the decision of the 'United States.
Confidential advices received today
from high official quarters are to the
effect that expressions of optimism
regarding the outcome $f the negotia
tions which have been' heard in cer
tain official and diplomatic circles are
not ; without foundation. Chairman
Stone, of the senate foreign relations
committee, declared after conferring
with administration officials that he
believed the case "was practically set
tied."

Trade Commission.
Washington, Feb. 7. Renewal of the
fight against George Rublee, of Cor
nish, N. H., now serving on the fed
eral trade commission as a recess ap
pointee, was forecast today when Sen
ator Galilnger, during an executive
session of the senate, ' demanded a
committee report on the appointment.
Senator Gallinger who led the oppo
sition during the last session of con
gress, has declared that Mr. Rublee is

Plan Compulsory
Insurance for Sick
SUBMITTED TO FEDERATION
STATE MEDICAL BOARDS
OF
TAX WAGE EARNERS $2
Patients Would be Assured of Careful
Treatment by Reputable Physicians
and Latter Would be Properly Paid.
Chicago, Feb. 7. Compulsory sick
ness insurance administered by the
federal government was advocated
here tonight before the Federation of
State Medical boards of the United
States by Dr. Otto V. Hoffman, secre
tary of the New York state board. Dr.
Hoffman proposed a plan under which
he said all reputable physicians would
have an assured income and the chief
incentives to quackery would be elim
inated. Tax of $2 a Year on Wage Earners.
The plan contemplated a tax of $2
a year on all wage earners whose in
come is less than $1,200. He estimates
that there are 83,000,000 such persons
in the United States. Each would have
the privilege of selecting his own doc
tor, but no physician would be allowed
to carry more than 2,000 names.
Practitioners Underpaid.
"This would mean $4,000 a year for
treating those that become sick or dis
abled, and statistics show that not
more than 60 of these would ever be
sick at the same time," said Dr. Hoff
man. "In general the public does not
realize how miserably underpaid the
medical profession is. There are 127,
000 active practitioners in the country
and their incomes aggregate $63,500,
000, an average of only $500 a year.
Not Too Many Doctors.
"Nor is it true, as has been often
stated, that 'there are too many doc
tors.' About 2 1-2 per cent, of the
population is constantly sick and dis
abled; an average of 19 patients a day
for each doctor. This does not take
into account much of the practice of
specialists. Furthermore, insurance
company statistics show that 69 per
cent, of the insured have some im
pairment of health.
"It is impossible for a doctor proper
ly to look after more than 16 patients
in eight hours' work. At prevailing
fees this just about pays expenses.
No Chance for Collusion.
"The only objection mustered against
compulsory sickness insurance by
those who have investigated its workings-m
Europe is the danger of malin
gering or collusion to get the sick
benefits. We could meet that objsc
tion by having no cash benefits hut by
simply providing the services of a doc
tor. Wage Earners Agree.
"I have talked with wage earners
and they agree that sick benefits
should be left to private companies.
They feel that if, by paying $2 a year
to the state, they could be insured
against doctors' bills, they would be
safeguarded against the greatest bur
den that they have to fear.
Mutual Benefits.
"Under compulsory insurance we
would be paid to keep our clientele in
sound health and it would be against
our interest to have sickness occur.
"When the medical profession is
paid to prevent sickness and is a loser
when anyone becomes sick, the day of
the quack and the charlattan will be
past. .
Clientele Could Seek Advice Freely.
"Under compulsory insurance we
could give advice freely without being
accused of wishing to advertise our
selves. We would be rid of the fee
splitting sin, consultations could be
held without any hindrances. Our cli
entele could seek our advice freely and
early.
Both the medical profession and
the people have everything to gain
and nothing to lose by adopting .com
pulsory sickness insurance." v
A NEW INTERPRETATION OF
WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT
Previous Condition of Health of Per
son Injured is Immaterial.
Boston, Feb. 7. A new interpreta
tion of the workmen's compensation
act, involving possible "grave econo
mic consequences of far reaching ef
fect," was made by the full bench
of the supreme court today, when ft
ruled that the previous condition of
health of a person injured while at
work does not affect the amount of
relief to be afforded under the act
The case was that of Mrs. Honore
E. Madden, an employe of the M. J.
Whittall carpet factory at Worcester,
who suffered an attack of angina pec
toris while pulling a carpet. The court
noted an argument that the harm that
the employe was due in large part
to a previously weakened condition of
her heart, but held this did not lessen
the employer's liability.
Discussing its decision, the court
stated that arguments had been
made "that grave economic conse
quences of far-reaching effect may
folow from the act thus construed. It
is 6aid that persons not in good health
may be excluded from employment
while the cost of conducting commer
cial and industrial enterprises may be
come prohibitively large. These con
siderations are of great public mo
ment but they relate to legislative
questions."

I stand ready to help him to do it."

in thirty days."
"If the fact could be ascertained, r
have no sort of doubt that at least
25,000 men, the very flower of the
country, died the first year of the
Civil war, not by bullets, but by dis
ease which was absolutely unnecessary
because while the officers were good
men in a general way. they did not
know anything about sanitation or
how to take care of themselves or how
to show the men how to take care of
themselves.
