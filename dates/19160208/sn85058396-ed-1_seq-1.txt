j extends over the whole Russian front
with the exception of a recrudescence
i of unimportant artillery, aeroplane
and mining warfare on the Dvinsk-
.' Riga line and information of the re-
$ cent transfer of large bodies of Ger-
man troops to the westward, are tak-
; en by the Russian authorities as an
indication that the Germans are con-
i tent for the present with holding their
i own in Bukowina and the northern
C sector, and are again preparing to
apply the greater part of their
strength on the western front.
Western front: In the absence of
any definite news in the Bukowina
region It Is assumed the deadlock
near Czernowltz where the muddy

they have employed since the begin

i lied Newspapers Failed to
Materializes Many Re
ports Purely Fanciful.
Berlin, Feb. S, by wireless to Sav
ville Reviews of the Franco-British
; offensive movement on the Franco
Belgian front are being published in
the Berlin newspapers.
Tbey are summarized by the Over
seas News Agency as follows:
"These offensive movements were
ushered in by formal announcements
of coming victor?', immediate and
certain as Lord Curzon declared in
August, 1914, when he already saw
the Bengalese and the Russians en
tering Berlin. Similar announce
ments were made when France, after
the success on the Marne, regained
her spirits. The third announcement
came when, in October, 1914, the Ger
man advance in Belgium was stopped
by inundations.
"According to Anglo-French news
papers, the great offensive movement
started in November, 1914 Accord
ing to some of their reports the
French re-conquered Lille on Novem
ber 15. The French also shelled Metz,
it was declared, and the Germans pre
pared for the defense of Strassburg.
In the spring of 1915 Italian news
papers announced the arrival of 700,
000 Hindus and 500,000 Japanese. It
v as likewise announced that Ostend
would fall within a few days, while
British newspapers declared that
Germany virtually had asked for
peace. These reports, however, were
all purely fanciful and imaginative."

IN GREAT WAR
Premier Briand Visits Rome
Italians Facing Difficulties
Which Must Be Overcome.
Paris, Feb. 8, 5:05 a. m. In ex
planation of Premier Briand's visit
to Italy, the Matin says that the pro
longation of the war led to certain
difficulties for the Italian govern
ment which, however, realizes that,
if Italy is to profit by the victory of
the allies, she must take an active
part in the operations.
"This will add to Italy's burden,"
says the Matin, "but will also in
crease the advantage which she is to
reap. Mr. Briand's reputation as a
long headed statesman is well estab
lished In Rome. It was he who saw
that the best way to protect Egypt
was to stay at Saloniki and the sal
vage of the Serbian army was due to
his steadfastness. His visits to Italy
will go far toward bringing about

Paris, Feb. 8, 10:05 a. m. "Russia's
munitions crisis Is now a thing of the
past," said General Pollvanoff, Rus
sian minister of war, in an interview
with Ludovic Naudeau, the special
correspondent of the Paris Journal In
Russia. "It is an unpleasant memory
but, fortunately only a memory,
"With regard to the troops," the
minister said, "their spirit is excel
lent, thanks to the system of mobili
zation by masses, which was put into
force a few months ago, and to the
doubling of the number of supply
depots. At the present time we have
a permanent reserve of young re
cruits large enough to enable us to
keep all the units up to their full
strength, without having to send to
the front half-trained men. This is
of great importance for it has been
observed that the morale of the sol
dier is apt to deteriorate when he
sees his company, which originally
had 250 or 300 men, reduced to a few

HIGH PRICE OF
SUGAR IN LONDON
British Royal Commission
Recommends More Restric
tions on Importations and
Economies in Use.
PRICE HAS DOUBLED
Must Avoid Shortage and Re
duce Tonnage Problem as
Well as Keep Down
Cost.
London, Feb. 8, 1:50 a. in More
restrictions on the importation of su
gar during the coming months in or
der to reduce its consumption is the
recommendation made by a British
roal commission. The report of the
commission says that economies in
the use of sugar will influence the
rate of exchange In favor of Great
Britain as all the sugar consumed
here Is imported.
The commission states that since
the beginning of the war the price
of sugar never has been less than
50 per cent above normal and that
now it is virtually double that price.
Notwithstanding the rise in price
there has been no considerable gen
eral reduction in the consumption of
sugar and the commission urges,
therefore, that less quantities of su
gar and also of jams, biscuits, sweet
meats and chocolates be used.
If this was done there would be no
shortage and less ground for the in
creases in the prices of these edibles,
the commission says, and it also will
reduce the tonnage problem and thus
help to keep down the cost of other
commodities.

tee. Miss Lillian D. Wnld of the
Henry Street Settlement of New

missioner of Immigration at New

heard.
The preparedness committee which
arranged the hearing submitted the
names of John P. White, president of

r
Governor Capper of Kansas and half
a dozen others, but the committee de
cided to hear no more than five.
Other opponents of preparedness
had a hearing before the house mili

Representatives of the National

meant a burden of taxation that

hands of an enemy.
President Dornblazer of the Farm
ers' Union of Texas and representing,
he said, farmers' organizations of 22
states, opposed compulsory military
service or any large increase in ex

Germany's Latest Reply Al

factory to United States.
Washington, Feb. S Germany's
latest reply In the Lusltania negotia
tions was characterized as almost, if
not entirely, acceptable to the United
States by high officials today after
Secretary Lansing had conferred
with President Wilson more than an
hour and the case had been discus
sed at the cabinet meeting. The
wholo situation was described by ad
ministration officials as "very hope
ful." Later today Secretary Lansing will
confer with Count Von Bernstorff,
the German ambassador. It is expect
ed he will communicate to the am
bassador the American government's
view of the latest proposal from Ber
lin which substituted for the word
"illegal" in -refercnceto'jtbe.sinking-of
the Lusitania a .declaration that
reprisals must not be extended to
other than enemy subjects.
Tho view reflected by administra
tion officials is that this declaration,
with the assurances Germany previ
ously had given and with the other
features of the Lusitania agreement
already agreed upon, is practically
satisfactory.
later high administration officials
authorized the statement that "the
United States and Germany are sub
stantially in accord."
Late today a high administration
official made this announcement
"A settlement of the Lusitania case
is in sight, probably within the next
few days. The United States has not
Increased its demands; it has not re
duced them. You can draw your own
conclusions as to the basis of the
agreement."
The same official said:
"The wording proposed by Germany
appears to cover the position of the
United States. It is not fair to as
sume that there will have to be any
further admissions or concessions
from Berlin "

$200 a ton If congress decides' to erect

bills passed the house yesterday.

city of not less than 20,000 tons of

bill.
Chairman Tillman and Senators

Armor Barons Threat Useless.
"The threat of the armor barons to
hold up the government will not af
fecxcpngress." said Senator Tillman.
"We were given to understand that
the armor manufacturers would in
crease their price because government
manufacture of armor plate would
force them to go out of that business
and they would charge this enormous
increase in order to provide them
selves w ith an amortizating fund.
But I guess we can find a way to stop
the robbers. In time of trouble we
could seize their plants and operate
them by right of eminent domain."
On motion of Senator Phelan of
California, the committee agreed to
consider his bill to appropriate $10,
000,000 for construction of a naval and
aviation academy within 150 miles of
San Francisco. Senator Phelan was
directed to furnish the committee
with data on the need of such an
academy.

Following the announcement that
Rev. Henry Ostrom, the eastern evan

In Ogden under direction of nine fed
erated churches, -a flood of letters has
reached the committee in charge of
the arrangements, each one commend
ing the evangelist as a "live wire"
and also as a powerful preacher.
Among tho letters received today
regarding Dr. Ostrom was one from
C. B. Willis, general secretary of the
Young Men's Christian association in
Milwaukee and another from Rev. El
bert B. Dille. of the Trinity Methodist
Episcopal church in Berkeley, California.
becretary Willis gives the local
committee an interesting but concise
review of Dr. Ostrom's methods in the
following words- 'To my mind the
meetings have been ichiefly noted,
first, for his adherence to the funda
mental principles of the Word of God;
second, to his sane and practical appli
cation of those truths, with his always
apt and striking illustrations; third,
in his thorough humanness, being at
all times In close touch with the peo
ple; and 'fourth, his powerful spirit of
love and charitableness, never utter
ing a word that could be construed
as censorous or harsh."
C. C. Michener, who has known Sec
retary Willis for many years, said to
day that he considered the review
from this Milwaukee man as of special
importance as showing exactly what
Ogden ministers and laymen can ex
pect of the meetings that are to be

of Rev. Henry Ostrom. His preach
ing Is eminently sane and his mes
sage gives forth no uncertain sound.
I regard him as especially adapted to
the field in your city and state."
The letters that are being received,
because of announcements recently
made that Dr Ostrom would come
here, have caused tho committee
members to take special interest in

Americans Still Remember De- j
tails of Last War and Al- 1
leged British Abuse of
Sea Power. 8
London, Feb. 8, 10-20 a. m. The E
Manchester Guardian in an editorial ,1
suggests that Viscount Bryce, former-
ly British ambassador to the United
States, or Arthur J. Balfour, first I
lord of the admiralty, be sent to the 1
United States with full powers to ad-
just the blockade .controversy with 1
the government In' Washington. It n
publishes a statement from its Lon-
don correspondent to the effect that fl
people close In touch with Anglo-
American affairs express the opinion g
'.hat some such step should be taken. i
The Guardian says the blockade M
question is being pressed throughout
the United States no less persistently U
than is the Lusitania question and
with the dispute regarding the phrase- Wm
ology to be employed by Germany, I'
once settled, exclusive attention will I
be given to the blockade matter. The
Guardian dwells upon the fact that a
the British people are puzzled that i
purely trade subjects should create I
as much excitement as the question
of human life and says "British opin
ion has persistently overlooked the
fact that German diplomacy posses
sed two great advantages over ours.
The first is that the critical and even
hostile attitude of the American navy
towards British sea power, as well
as the theories on which it Is based,
is almost as old as the American na
tion Itself. Our last war with tho
United States arose out of what was
regarded by America as an abuse of
our power at sea. We have forgot
ten the details, but the United States 1
has not, and both then and now the
United States government regards it- I
self as the natural champion of neu-
tral rights. It is Impossible to ex-
aggerate the influence of these his-
toric facts on American policy. fl
United States'' Attitude.
"Secondly, it will be remembered I J
that at the conference of Paris fifty t B
years ago which abolished privateer-
ing, the United States refused to U
agree on the ground that, although il
the abolition might aid the cause of Jj
humanity in war, it favored the great R
naval powers of the world at the ex- n
pense of the powers with a large mer- i
cantlle marine but a small navy.
Something of this principle influences
America's attitude towards Germany's
use Oi me suumanue as uu mauu- y
ment of war."
Tho Guardian declares that the '
controversy touches one of the strong
est currents of American history with jj'
which Great Britain must deal and, '
while there is little conservatism I
among the American people, in no j
other country in the world is the :
force of tradition in the conduct of
foreign relations so strong. J
Controversy Is Grave. 1
"We take a very grave view of the i I
difficulties into which the whole of
this controversy may lead us," says j
the Guardian. "There is great work i I
to be done and It is work that cannot R
he done too soon," the newspaper I
says in conclusion. "This is not JJ
merely a program of the war; it may j jjjl
effect the whole future of the Eng- 811
