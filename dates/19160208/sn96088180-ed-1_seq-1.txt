ment and the armor plate makers are
prepared for a fight. ,
The senate naval committee al
ready haa recommended passage of
tho bill for government manufacture
of armor plate, but thla will not pass

German Fleet, Newly Equip

Said to Be Preparing for

London, Feb. 8. -That a mighty
battle is imminent In the North sea
is believed here today. '
Dutch rumors that the Germans,
are preparing for their long-expected
dash constituted the basis for such
belief when coupled with seemingly
corroborative reports from other
sources. The Hague reports were
that tbe Germans along tho Belgian
coast had withdrawn and taken
refuge in the Kiel canal, where Ger
many's war dogs have been held In
leash for most of the war. .
Moreover, leaves of absence for all
officers are reported to have 'been
cancelled.
At the same time Copenhagen re
port said there la extreme activity
at Kiel and that tbe German ships
are about to venture forth and risk
an engagement Four Zeppelins and
a flock of Taubes have reinforced the
air flotilla at Kiel, and It is assnmed
that these will accompany the war

Vague rumor that the Germans
planned to attempt a startling coup
reached London before the English
liner Appam waa bagged by a Ger
man commerce raider. Since then
almost every Berlin dispatch has con
tained similar rumors.
Germany, according to the stories
here, has laid well her plans for a
long-delayed venture on tbe seas. Her
dreadnaught have been equipped
with .17-Inch guns, while her Zeppe
lins have been fixed so they can shoot
torpedoes from the air. preparatory
to challenging the British navy.
At the same time, England has not
been unmindful of the possibility of
a sea raid, and to this end has been
on careful guard. Any venture on
Germany's part, navy men say, will

DEMOCRATIC
INDICTED BY
Federal Probers find True
Bill Against Representatives
ol the Central Powers at
San Francisco Today
Washington, Feb. 8. German
Consul Franz Bopp, of San Francisco,
was included today among indict-
meats returned by the federal grand
Jury at San Francisco. Others re
turned were: Turkish Consul Hall;
German Vice-Consul von Schack, of
the San Francisco consulate, and one
Kauffmann, consulate staff member.
Twenty indictments In all were re
turned. Tbe charges Include viola
tion of the penal code relating to con
spiracy, and violation of the Sherman
anti-trust law.
Trials of the Indicted men are
slated for late in April.
It Is understood that Bopp is
charged with complicity In the al
leged plots of C. C. Crowley and
Baron von Brincken to hold np ship
ments of powder, and to send a spy
to Canada to destroy a railroad tun
nel. Indictment of von Schack and
Kauffmann I understood to be on
the same charges.
Turkish Consul Hall is said to have
been engaged in the so-called "Sacra
mento expedition," In which it Is
charged that the ship Sacramento was
sent out of San Francisco to supply
a German squadron.
The Indictments were announced
by the department of Justice.
San Francisco, Feb. 8. Word of
tbe Indictment of Consul Bopp and
other representatives of the central
powers here did not come as a sur
prise, as it had been reported that
Bopp and von Schack would be drawn
Into the federal net around alleged
anti-ally bomb plotters.
Investigation of the . activities of
the consulate had been proceeding
for some time. The first arrests as
a result of this probe were C. R.
CroWley, Baron von Brincken, and
Mrs. Margaret Cornell. It was claim
ed these parties had been active in
anti-ally plotting. They pleaded not
guilty.
Word of the Turkish consul' in
dictment, however, was an unexpect
ed development.

bers to that of value.
These moves would raise $35,000,
000, it is estimated, thus replacing
(33,000,000 worth of stamp taxes
scheduled for repeal.
While the Increased tax on whiskey
Is bound to meed with concerted op
position from many liquor interests,
leaders are Inclined to believe that
such a move would be more popular
than tbe stamp tax. ,
"Dry" members will give such a
plan their ardent support, while other
members are likely to support It from
the standpoint of political and econ
omio expediency.

hour after tbe nitro-glycerine mixing
house blew up, killing three men, one
of the packing bouses of the Du Pont
company's plant near here was de
stroyed by a fire of mysterious origin
and an explosion last night. News
of the second disaster was withheld
by officials of the company and be
came known today only by accident
I. J. Cox, superintendent of the
Du Pont Powder company, declared
today that he is unable to account
for the destruction of the packing
house, and intimated that outside
agents may have started the fire.
In this connection It became known
today that Gustavo Wolff, one of the
men killed In yesterday's explosion,
waa formerly in the German army.
He had been employed at the plant
since last April.
Cox said tbe fire may have been
set by foreign agents, although he
had no evidence to support this the
ory. He said the powder In the house
exploded following discovery of the
fire, completely wrecking the build
ing. The fire department was called
and kept the flames from spreading
to adjoining buildings.
Guards at the plant made a thor
ough investigation, hut were unable

GO ON WAR PATH
Phoenix, Ariz., Feb. 8. Lashed in
to a fury of hate against the whites
by Chief Bzoshe, 80-year-old tribal
leader, the Navajo Indians in north
ern Arizona today are prepared to go
on the war path.
This was the news brought to Flag
staff by Wm. Durbee, superintendent
of construction of the Indian school
at Tuba, who fought his way on skis
through 150 miles of snow and cold
of Arctic severity.
It is days since Durbee started on
his terrible Journey, and it is possible
that the Indians may have already
massacred the 20 white families on
the Painted desert near the reserva
tion. United States Attorney Tom Flynn
and United States . Marshal Dillon
waited instructions from Washington
today before acting. As all roads
are heavy with snow, transportation
of troops to the scene would be verj
difficult, necessitating a march of 150
miles from the railroad. 'j
Chief Bzoshe is the Indian who
stirred up the last Navajo uprising.
He was induced to surrender y Gen
eral Scott, who penetrated the hostile
country accompanied by only one
aide. .

Army Chief Tells fenittee
on Military Affairs Eneay
Could Not Land Trccps b
Numbers on American Soil
Washington, Feb. 8. Landing of
500,000 Invader on American shores
would be impossible if submarine
were active, declared General Nelson
A. Miles before the house military
committee today. At the same time
Admiral Blue declared the navy could
reach the Pacific coast before an '
enemy could land thereon.
These two statements stood out in
the midst of a constant stream of
pessimistic testimony regarding pre
paredness of the nation presented for
several weeks to the committee.
Blue said that the Panama canal
would aid the fleet to reach the Pa
cific in haste, if required. He urged
the need of purchasing anti-aircraft
guns, and recorded himself a op
posed to a one-year enlistment plan.
"If half a million of men landed
on either coast," said Miles, "and
we were unable to raise enough men
to drive them out, I would want to
more to another country." ,
' -He declared that America's coast
fortifications equalled any in the
world, not excepting those at the
Dardanelles. In this connection, he
said that the experience' of the Euro
pean war has shown that battleship
are ineffective in reducing such forts.
As for conscription, he said it was
not worth much.
"Overseas expeditions such as we
are told will proceed against ua are
expensive, and as a rule disastrous,"
he continued. "They spring from the
minds of men, writing about pre
paredness, who know less about. war
than anything else." '
Representative of the National
grange and the Farmers union pro
tested to the committee against "mili
tarism." T. J. Tabor informed the
members that farmers of 33 states,.
In convention at Oakland, had de
clared for government manufacture
of munitions.
"Would you farmers do away with
cyclone cellars," asked Congressman
Kahn.
"I have a stone cellar now, but I'd
be a fool to build another," retorted
Organizer Dornblazer of Texas, rep
resenting the union. He favored
more coast defenses and submarines,
however.
