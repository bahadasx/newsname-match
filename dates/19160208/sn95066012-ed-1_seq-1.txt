It is also noted that Lord Kitchener
had a long audience with the King a
few days ago.
Changes of great importance in the
direction of war are contemplated
says The Daily Sketch. It' sdys that
Karl Kitchener probably will leave
ho War Oince.
Sketch also says that Sir Wil
lii -TVrtsou, now Chief of Staff,
will i. .. take over active direc
tion of tb.. fx without interference,
except from the Cabinet as a 'whole,
and that a civiliun of real ability for
organization will become Secretary of
Wa.
In the event that Lord Kitchener
leaves the War Office. The Sketch
adds, he will undertake work of an
important character elsewhere.
Commenting on the new order that
the Chief of Staff "shall be respons
ible for Issuing the orders of the Gov
ernment . regarding military opera
tions," The Daily Mail says:
"Since the creation of the Ministry
of Munitions no more important
change in tho functions of the Secre
tary foi War has taken place."
The order means that in future
army orders will go out in tho name
of Sir William Robertson, the Chief
of Staff, instead of that of Lord Kit
chener, as heretofore.

SURPRISES IM THE CHANGES
In Some Cases Shifts Were Made By
Narrow Margins and for the
First Time in Yeare.
Np-license gained in the local op
tion changes made . oy 10 . towns out
of the 56 in the four western counties
of Massachusetts 'that held thier an
nual town-meeting yesterday. Of tho
10, six changed from license to no-li
cense and four from dry to wet. Some
of tho changes were big surprises,, as
they altered policies of. years' stand
ing. Interesting action outside of
that on license was that of Hunting
ton in voting to have its selectmen do
all in their power to, get tho Lee-Hunt
ington trolley line started and that of
Enfield in appropriating $500 for the
celebration of its 100th anniversary.
Most of the meetings were qutet and
appropriations conservative.
Granville went wet by a vote of 68
to 43 for the first time in many years.
Chester, which lust year went dry by
only one vote, went wet yesterday by
124 to 116. Ooshen went dry by 10 to
1. Last year it was wet by eight to
two. Russell, wet lust year by US to
58, went dry by 105 to !)5 as & result
of a vigorous ; no-liceuse campaign.
The. recent tragic murder of Sheriff
Lawton in that 'town, thought ' by
maiiy to have been attributable to the
sale of liquor, was probably partly re
BponRiblfe for the change in sentiment,
Tile drys almost won in Huntington,
wherp they, polled a vote of 150
agaiusi 154 wet, the closest in years:
Otis. tapped into the dry column
by just one vole as tho drys had 41
and the wets 40, This Is the first
time in 50 years that the town has
been dry. Wc-rthington did just the
opposite thing, as it went wet by one
vote after 25 years of no-lincse. The
vote was ) to 4!. Lenox went dry
by 204 to 254, a big surprise as the
town has been wet for many years.
Stockbrldge went dry by 30 votes;
Shelhurne wet by 15(! to 149, and Sa
voy dry by 28 to 23 for the first time
in several years.
