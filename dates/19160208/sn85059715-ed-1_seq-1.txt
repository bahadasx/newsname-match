At Mpnday night's meeting, Guy
M. Harbert; Harrison, county road
engineer, spoke on the various kinds
of roads that are suitable to conditions
In Simpson district.
The good roads movement In this
county is not only confined to Simpson
district, although It is the only
district In which definite action has
been taken. Other districts, It is
said, are pursuing a policy of "watchful
waiting." Clay district is merely
waiting to formulate plans for the
Improvement of Its roads before action
Is taken, according to leading
men of tbat district, who arc keenly
interested in the Simpson district
campaign.
If the plans go through In all the
districts, It is thought tbat. In a
year or two all Important towns of
the county will be connected with
roads that can be traversed by all
kinds, of vehicles at all times of the
year.

tojfurlhcr action in the matter of
the proopsed increase of shipping
rates on coal hauled out of the West
Virginia Holds to points east, west

fective, ruin the coal industry In West

the coal business itself but would paralyze
evety other line of commercial!
activity.

HANGING IN
THE BALANCE
Validity Depends on Action of
Federal Tribunal at
Washington.
Tho West Virginia prohibition law (
Is hanging In the bulanco, and will so
remain until the handing down of a ,
decision in the cases of tho JanieB
Clark Distilling Company, a Maryland
concern, against the American Ex- '
press Company, the Western Mary1
land Railway Company and the Stato 1
of West Virginia, appealed from the I
United StateB circuit court to the hu- i
preme court last year. Meanwhile |,j
i Fred 0. Blue, state commissioner of |
prohibition, has prepared an cxhaus- 1
tive brief upholding'the right or this
state under the YoM and Webb-Kenyon
state and federal laws to prohibit
the shipping or bridging Into the
state or Intoxicating liquors for un- 1
lawful purposes. I
The question is whether the operation
of the law passed by the West i
Virginia legislature interferes' with <
insterstate commerce since the
sago of the federal law meant'to rdb
Intoxicants of their interstate character.
The state contends that the
Yost law does not Interfere with the
legal rights of any shipper, and on
this contention the case will be argued
late in the present month?
probably the twenty-third.
Meanwhile department officers are
guarding the points of IngreSB on the
line between the "wet" and "(Iry"
territory and the bringing In of Intoxicants
haB beon reduced to a small
fraction of what It was before the
opora'tlon of the court order against
the carrying of labeled packages of j
liquors as personal baggage on trninB. ,
The several Interstate railroads ,
! that have been enjoined are. It Is de1
clared, doing all In their power to ,
1 carry out the order of the courts; (
' and when all the carrying concerns ,
| have been similarly enjoined, It was
1 said by Deputy C. F. Bath bono today, ,
! ninety per cent of the volume of shipments
now being made will be eliml.nated.
