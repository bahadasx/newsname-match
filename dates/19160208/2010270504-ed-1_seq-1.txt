WILL FARLINGER BECOMES
VIOLENTLY INSANE
HOUSE Tit EM' NOW
LANGUISHES IN .TAIL
Will Fabllnger was brought In from
Garfield precinct yesterday by Sher
iff Salisbury In a violently inaano con
dition. Ho was placed In a cell room
at the county Jail nnd will have a
hearing before the board of Insanity
today.
Fabllnger became mentally derang
ed while serving as a Jurtor In the dis
trict court week before last. Ho is a
young man, married last June, and
under normal conditions Is n very
quiet, unassuming individual. lie was
devotedly religious and it is thought
that the evidence in the James nnd
Fear cases, on both of which ho sat
as a juror, shpeked his religious sens
itiveness and deranged his mind. The
cases involved the lionor of women,
and the testimony was consequently
at times such as to shock a man of
modest and retiring disposition. At
least this Is the supposed cause of
Fabllnger's Insanity, for prior to com
ing to North Platte to attend cour.t he
gave no evidence of mental derange
ment. The case is one that saddens all the
acquaintances of the afflicted man.
"North Platto Hoys as Authors
The Library has recently been given
some books to which an especial inter
est attaches because the authors arc
Xorth Platte "boys." Prof. E. C. El
lfott is the author of three of the
books, "City School Supervision,"
"State and County School Administra
tion" and "Portland Survey" which
was made by Prof. Elliott and one of
the faculty of Leland Stanforl Uni
versity. Prof. Ben. G. Elliott is one of
the authors of "Gasoline Automo
biles." All books' returned to the library
from 4iomes where a contagious dis
ease existed at the time the book was
in the possession of the family are
Ipromptly burned as it is practically
impos-Eble to properly fumigate a
iook. The work of destroying the
b6ok Is done 'at the library so. that
there may be no question as tf its
destruction.

A fellow named Townscnd was ar
rested at Qandy yesterday on the
charge of stealing a horse from Harry
P. Stevens living south of Maxwell,
and last night was brought in by
Deputy Sheriff Wilson and lodged In
Jail.
Townscnd had been working for sev
eral months for Mr. Stevens nnd ap
parently coveted a very fine horse be
longing to the latter. As tfmo passed
tills desire to possess the animal In
creased, and finally he concluded to
assume the role of a horse thief. He
made ills get away with the animal
Saturday night. The disappearance of
the man and horse was discovered
early the next morning and Shoriff
Salisbury notified. The lattb. immedi
ately got busy with the telepTrone lines,
with the result that thirty hours after
Townscnd left the Stevons ranch ho
wbb in custody of the Logan county
shoriff. The horse was recovered, loft
at Qandy and will bo taken homo by
the owner.
The case against Townscnd is so
clear that he will undoubtedly plead
guilty, in which case ho will appear
before Judge Grimes within a week
and be sentenced. Thus will the pop
ulation nt the penitentiary credited to
Lincoln county be increased. '

ercont and gloves. When I returned

full settlement last week. I wish to
recommend said company and' agent
