there are no radical lines in the make
or construction of cars, all indica
tions point to the shortage of ma
terials.
"In view of this fact, the manu
iacturers look forward to a remark
able raise in prices. Some of the
manufacturers stated that their prices
would probably advance between 15
and 25 per cent. This, however, is
not expected to decrease the sale of

mary law was on trial in the Minne

was the argument against it in to

Charles Cominsky, of Schneider Bros.,
in An Interview States People
Buying Freer.
ADVISES CITIZENS TOMAKE
BIG "BID" FOR VACATIONISTS
Despite Rise in Dye and Leather
Prices, Local Store to Maintain
Usual Prices.
NoteThe following is the
first of a series of interviews
with Bemidji business men about
vital questions of the day. The
next will appear in an early issue
of the Pioneer.Editor.
"What will business conditions be
in Bemidji and the country during
1916? The prospects look much
brighter than ever before.'
That is the way Charles Cominsky
of Schneider Bros company, dealers
in men's and women's furnishings,
lines up the situation. His reasons
for the bright prospects are set forth
as follows:
Money is Easier.
"Money is much easier and in the
retail end we find people buying much
freer than last year I believe that
there will be more work for the
workingmen in 1916 in the country
than there ever was in the history
of the United States The same is
true with Bemidji I believe that
laborers will be scarce.
Farmers Trade Here.
"Bemidji is the center of a great
district Many people are trading in
the city. Farmers are trading more
than ever in the city and they ap
pear to like Bemidji as a trading
point."
Mr. Cominsky is not a man to be
come over enthusiastic over the pres
ent conditions and believes that there
is still room for striving for Bemidji
citizens. One of the ways in which
to increase business in Bemidji, ac
cording to Mr. Cominsky, is to make
a "big bid" for summer tourists and
vacationists.
Should Write Friends.
"Every business man and citizen
in Bemidji ought to co-operate in
boosting for summer business by
writing to their friends, manufac
turers and wholesalers with whom
they do business, telling them of the
most beautiful spot in America for
a summer vacation," said Mr. Com
insky.
In speaking of business in connec
tion with the men's and women's fur
nishings, Mr. Cominsky said:
Prices the Same.
"While the dye situation has been
very serious in the past and will be
worse in the future, the merchandise
that we purchased for the spring
season is all dyed with the genuine
indigo dyes and the colors are fast.
"There have been some advances
in the merchandise on account of the
dye, wool and cotton situation, but
the advance is at the manufacturers'
end. We will continue to sell all the
products at the same price as usual
with the exception of one article and
that is blue overalls, the price of
which having been raised to $1.25
by the manufacturer.
"The leather market has taken a
good advance but we bought our
shoes at the same prices as last year
and expect to sell all the shoes at
the same price as last year."
NAVAL MILITIA
DRILLS TO MUSIC
For the first time since its organi
zation, the Bemidji Naval Militia last
night drilled to music. Almost the
entire band turned out to furnish
marches for the navy boys.
MERCHANTS ANDCOMMERCIAL
CLUB CONSIDER MERGE
A meeting of the Bemidji Mer
chants' association and the Commer
cial club is being held this afternoon
to consider the merging of the two
organizations.

WAR CORRESPONDENT
ATCITYHALLTONIGHT
E. J. D. Larson to Give His Famous
i
Warologue Under Auspices of
Bemidji Elks.
E. J. D. Larson, who has visited
the European war zone, gives his
famous warologue tonight at the
city hall. The warologue will be il
lustrated with two hundred scenes
from the warring countries, and will
be intensely interesting.
Mr. Larson has just received word
of the death of the aviator with whom
he made an ascent near Paris. While
making a flight in the war zone, his
machine became crippled and fell,
carrying the aviator with it to his
death
In Red Wing, where Mr. Larson
gave his waralogue, there was a large
audience present, a larger crowd, it
is said, than greeted Bryan when he
appeared there.
Mr. Larson's lecture takes sides
with none of the participants in the
great struggle, and aims to be neut
ral in the truest sense of the word.
The entertainment is given for the
benefit of the Elks and should draw
