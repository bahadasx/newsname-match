WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. B.—l.eitJing a hand
in the national campaign now being waged by

Congressman Will E.
Humphrey of Seattle,
showing his direct connec
tk*§in unloading upon
the government the no
torious Seattle postoffice
site for 5169,500 in Janu
ary, 1912.
This site, at Sixth ave.
S. and Atlantic St., has
been rejected by Secretary
McAdoo because it is not
only under seven feet of
water, but is out of the
way and not easily acces
sible. According to Ihe
postoffice authorities, it
would c(tst Sio,ooo a year
extra to handle mail froir.
this site.
In a published interview
in Seattle, Rep. Humphrey,
when confronted with the
undesirability of the site,
attempted a flat denial that
he had had any part in in
fluencing; the selection of the site.
Humphrey Denies Part in Negotiation*
"I never had anything to do with the purchase of
the site," he said in that interview. "In fact, I always
have refused to take any part in negotiations having to
do with the expenditure of government money for sites
within my district. It is ridiculous to assert that I par
ticipated in the negotiations."
Aa showing Representative Humphrey DID Interest himself In the
matter, several letters written by Humphrey, marked confidential."
).ave been found In the files of the treasury department
They were written to the then Secretary of the Treasury .Mac
\ ragh and to Humphrey's old friend, Hob Bal'lev, then assistant secre
tary of the trenaury.
The site was purchased thru R. W. Hill, a Seattle real estate man
and close political asnviate of Humphrey.
Hill was appointed t'nlted State* census taker for the Seattle dis
trict In J9lO.
The property was bought from Prank W. Raker and others of Se
attle Maker waa at one time campaign manager for Humphrey.
Today, for the first time, the treasury department has given out
the full text of Humphrey's letters. They speak for themselves.
On October 12, 1910, Humphrey wrote to Secretary MacYeagh as
follow*:
"I wired you yesterday in regard to the purchase of the poatoffice
a'.te here In Seattle. There are many ugly rumor* afloat In regard to
thla matter. Under all circumstances, I think It would be best for
the department to hold this matter in abeyance until Senator Pllea and
