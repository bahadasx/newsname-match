PNEUMONIA CURE.
In view of the prevalence of pneu
monia to such an alarming extent,,
and the many deaths resulting there
from, I send you the following for
publication: "Take six to ten onions
according to size, and chop fine, put
in a large spider over a hot fire;
then add about the same quantity of
rye meal, and vinegar enough to
make it a thick paste. In the mean
while sir it thoroughly, letting it sim
mer five or ten minutes. Then put
in a cotton bag large enough to
cover the lungs, and apply it to the
chest as hot as the patient can bear.
When it gets cool apply another, and
thus continue by reheating the poul
tices. In a few hours the patient will
be out of danger. Usually three or
four applications will be? sufficient but
continue always until perspiration
starts freely from the chest. This
simple remedy was formulated many
years ago by one of the best physi
cians New England has ever known,
who never lost a patient by this di
sease. New York Sun.
