CHALLENGE IS TAKEN.
Facing Squeeze of $24,000,-
000, Senators Vote for Bill to
Acquire Government Works.
WASHINGTON, Feb. S.-Prlvato
armor plbte manufacturers notified
tho Senate Naval Committee to-day
that tooy would raise the prlco of
armor plato JIM a ton It Congress
decides to crecf or purchase armor
plato factories for tho Government.
Wnrnlng was also given that tho
armor plate men will Immediately go
out of business on completion of a
Government plant.
Tho Committee,, nevertheless, voted
to recommond Government plants.
Senator Penrose, nepublluan, of
Pennsylvania, notified tho oomlntttco
of tho stand of tho armor plato manu
facturers, those chiefly concerned
being tho Hcthlchem and Mldvalc
Steel Companies.
The committee voted 9 to 3 to re
port favorably Senator Tillman's bill
to authorize tho Secretary of tho
Navy to provldo cither by erection
or purchase of an armor plate fac
lory, with a capacity of not less than
20,000 Ions of armor a year. The bill
would iippruprlato Ul.000,000.
Senators Penrose, Ijodgo and Smith
of Michigan, Republican, voted
against reporting the bill. Chairman
Tillman and Senators Swanson,
Hryan, Johnson, Maine, Chilton, Pho
Ian and Plttman, Democrats, and
Clapp and Polndcxter, Itcpubllcuns,
voted for It.
"The threat of tho armor barons to
hold np tho Government will not af
fect Congress," said Senator Tillman
"Wo were Kien to understand that
the armor manufacturers would In
cren.o their prlco becauho Govern
inent manufacture of armor nlate
would forco them to ko nut of that
business and they would charge thll
enornioiiH iuercasn in order to provldo
themtelvcH with an amortisation fund,
fund.
"Hut 1 guess we can find a way to
stop the robbers. In tlmo of troublo
we could sclzo their plans and operate
them by right of eminent domain."
Senator Tillman figured that if the
armor plato manufacturers did ralso
tho price It would cost the Government
J2I.000.000 -extra for urmor plate to
complelii tho Ilvo-year nnvul building
programme, fienntor Tillman said ho
proposed to nk Senator Penrose, to
repeat tho announcement of the
armoi plato manufacturers to tho
Semite.
Ueforo to-day's hearing the com
mittee has, been Inclined to favar a
plan whereby tho Government should
build part of Its armor and prlvato
firms pie rt iiialiidcr. Hut to-day'H
developments make It probable that

maiiuracaiiers that a a iipueinl In

AT ENGAGEMENT OF
Objection Is Madfe to the Pres

Damrosch's Organization.
TEUTONS ARE PREPARED.
i
Several Are United States Citi
zens and Others Have
Taken First Papers.
The management of the Ncr York
Symphony Orchestra, of which Walter
Damrosch Is conductor, was surprised
to-day to hear th.it tho citizens of
Ottawa, Canada, nro all worked up.
over tho announcement that tho or
ganization la to give a concert thero
on Feb. 16. The Damrosch organi
zation has given four concerts In
Canada slnco the beginning of the
year, two in Toronto, one In Mon
treal and ope In Quebec.
It appears that tho destruction of
tho Parliament building lu Ottawa
has uroused the people or"1 that olty
to white heat of resentment against
anything savoring in tho remotest
way of Germany.
Tho Impression prevails In'Ottawa
that the Now York Symphony Orch
estra la exclusively a Teutonic or
ganization nnd a leading evening
nowspaper there carried un editorial
on Its first pago yesterday protesting
against a Gorman musical organiza
tion visiting tho city and taking away
good Canadian money and "gloating
over tho ruins of tho Parliament
buildings."
Tho New York Symphony Orchestra
has only nlno German-born players
In Its membership and five of these
nro naturalized Anierlcnns. The other
four did not visit Canada with tho or
ganization lnre tho beginning of the
wnr nnd will not go next week.
Thn members of tho Now York
Symphony Orchestra aro gathered
from thirteen nationalities. Accord
ing to George Knglcs, malinger of
the Symphony Society of Now York,
every member with tho exception of
tho four Germane who was not born
In this country has a tot of prop
erly certified citizenship papers.
"In our orchestru," said Mr. Knglcs,
"wo havo nineteen Americans, ono
Englishman, two Frenchmen, four na
turalized Germans, four Kelglans, ono
Austrian, fifteen Russians,- two Ital
ians three Hollanders and ono Swiss.
Tho manager who Is to take tho or
ganization to Ottawa and Montreal
next week is a Canadian, Mr, W.
Spencer Jones."
.Mr. Hngles said that lu view of tho
cosmopolitan character of tho mem
bership of the orchestra It Is neces
sary to prescrvo tho strictest of neu
trality In tho organization. , Ily com
mon consent nobody ever talks about
tho war. As for Mr. Damrosch, un
American, ho is of German descent
and on Jan, 22 was quoted in an In
terview as follows:
"Although my ancestry Is German,
I do not feel that I should be obliged
to subscribe to alt the political ambi
tions of that country."
On each of Its trips to Canada since
the beginning of the war tho New
Vork Symphony Orchestra has truv

the Hrlllsb Kinbassy at Washington.
A similar document will bn taktn

GRESSER SAYS
ON SUBWAYS COST JOB
Thi books of Andrew Freedman, who died after a short illness a few
weeks ago, are being examined by expert accountants acting for the
Thompson Legislative Committee. Mr. Freedman was a director of the
Interborough and a leading, figure in tjje tangled negotiations leading to
the signing of the contracts between the city and the Interborough for
building the subway extensions.
Evidence gathered by the expert accountants from Mr. Freedman's
books will be spread on the records of the investigation. It is believed
that this evidence will serve to clear up some of the mystery attending
payments of large sums of money by the Interborough to individuals and
firms. Whether Mr. Freedman kept a complete set of accounts' or not
has not been revealed, but whatever the state of his records they can
probably be cleared up, if obscure,
persons named therein.
