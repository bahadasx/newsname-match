WARNED AGAINST
GUESSING POLICY
IN BUSINESS LIFE
Washington, Feb. 8. Warning to
American business men to place less
dependence on the "proverbial Ameri
can guess" and to do constructive
thinking, to become lesspartSsanin
dealing with great economic questions,
and to systematically discourage the
prevalent disparagement of the efforts
of men in public life, was voiced by
John H Fahey, president of the Cham
ber of Commerce of the United States,
at the opening of its fourth annual
convention today.
"I am convinced," said President
Fahey, "that if we are quite frank
with ourselves we must realize that for
many years we have been very poorly
informed as to the real facts involved
in great questions before the country
of special interest to us. The workmen
in their organizations and the farmers
in theirs have been far better posted
on Questions of importance to them
'than have the business men in their
field, but we have now come to the
period in the history of America when
less dependence can be placed on the
proverbial American guess. We must
begin to do constructive thinking.
"I believe also that American busi
ness men would be much more useful
'if they were less inclined toward par-
tisansnip in aeamig wuu me si cm.
economic questions which so vitally
affect their interests. A number of our
most important problems would have
been disposed of in congress years ago
but for petty politics.
"Another thing we business men
should set out systematically to dis
courage is the altogether too prevalent
and continuous disparagement of the
efforts of men in public life. When
the business man himself has a little
experience with holding office or when
he comes to understand congress or
the average state legislature as it
really is, he usually begins to change
his views about public servants if he
is at all fair minded.
"If congressmen or senators do not
understand business questions, a fair
share of responsibility rests with the
business men for until we formed this
organization we never employed any
method for advising them that they
could be expected to accept as repre
senting the business view. I am satis
fied that congress Is glad to be fair to
business and to cooperate with us in
the advancement of the common wel
fare. Business will never get fair
otrfpraMnn of its lust claims in con
gress by employing roundabout meth
ods. The day of indirection passed
long ago. I know I reflect the senti
ment of the business men of the na
tion when I say that all we want is to
have our causes considered dispassion
ately and we are confident that the
right kind of a verdict will usually re
sult. Believing this, we should be aiert
to call to account any business man or
business men, who by other methods
would discredit business as a whole."
President Fahey said that 700 com
mercial bodies are affiliated with the
chamber, which in membership and In
the widespread character of repre
sentation, "far exceeds in size any
similar organization in the world."
Reports of officers occupied the re
mainder of the opening session. The
convention will continue throughout
Thursday, with national defense as the
chief topic of discussion on the closing
day. president Wilson will speak at
'he annual banquet Thursday night
Navy Ready
to Meet Any
Hostile Fleet
Washington, Feb. 8. The United
States navy is ready to meet any ene
my it could possibly meet in the Pa
cific ocean, Rear Admiral Victor Blue
told the house'TraTat'cdmmtttee today
in response to questions by Represen
tative Britton of Illinois.
Admiral Blue conceded that Japan,
Germany and France all had more offi
cers and men in active service than
the United States, and added that the
great weakness of the American navy
was want of a proper reserve.
Sir. Britton asked if the navy had
not failed to conduct a war mobiliza
tion recently because of lack of men
to handle all the ships. Admiral Blue
replied that no navy was kept filled to
its war footing.
"How much time would we be likely
to have to mobilize if we were attack
ed?" asked Mr. Britton.
"That would be an important thing
i to know," said the admiral.

twenty per cent, according to the class
i of work, and the others call for a uni

WILSON PUTS
APPROVALON
BERLIN NOTE
Is Indicated That President
Believes Terms Offered
Are Acceptable.
SECRETARY IS SILENT
Lansing Says Nothing to Be
Given Out After Cabi
net Meeting.
Washington, Feb. 8. Germany's lat
est reply in the Lusitania negotiations
was characterized as almost, If not en
tirely acceptable to the United States
by high officials today after Secretary
Lansing had conferred with President
Wilson and the case had been uis
cussed at length at the cabinet meet
ing.
High administration officials author
ized the statement that "the United
States and Germany are substantially
in accord.
Late today Secretary Lansing will
confer with Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador. It is expected he
will communicate to the ambassador
the American government view of the
latest proposal from Berlin which sub
stituted for the word illegal, in the ref
erence to the sinking of the Lusitania,
a declaration that reprisals must not
be extended to others than enemy sub
jects.
Settlement Hoped For.
Another high administration official
said that the case could not be consid
ered finally settled, but that it was
hoped a settlement might be reached
during the conference between Secre
tary Lansing and the German am
bassador, although that was not abso
lutely certain. It was understood that
the exact wording of the communica
tion submitted by Count von Bern
storff was not "in entire accord with
the views of the president and the cab
'inet.
That the Lusitania case looks "very
hopeful was the statement made by
a high administrative official follow
ing the conference between President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing. It was
indicated that the president consid
ers Germany's latest offer as almost
if not entirely acceptable.
Secretary Lansing and the president
conferred until a few minutes before
the cabinet meeting in the seclusion
of the president's study in the White
house. Mr. Lansing would make no
statement as he went into the White
house offices.
After the cabinet meeting Mr. Lan-
sing said there was "no statement to
i be given out at this time." He added
j that he might see Count von Bern
I storff later in the day.
It was understood, however, that a
! conference between the ambassador
and the secretary later in the day was
probable.
More Correspondence.
Under the surface there were inti
mations that some further correspond
ence may be under way while Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
consider Germany's latest proposal.
It has not been disclosed whether it
may be with the American embassy in
Berlin or with Colonel E. M. House,
the president's personal representa
tive, who was recently in Berlin.
Secretary Lansing's announcement
when Germany's answer was received,
that it would be four or five days be
fore a decision was reached, is being
recalled by those who believe further
correspondence is in progress.
The statement that a mere question
of words would not be permitted to
block a settlement of the case at this
stage, which came from the highest
authority, has thrown an atmosphere
of optimism about the situation, which
continues to lead officials in close
touch with the negotiations to believe
that a successful termination of the
case is close at hand.

Editor Says
End Dispute
on Blockade
London, Feb. 8, (10:20 a. m.) The
Manchester Guardian in an editorial,
suggests that Viscount Brice, formerly
British ambassador to the United
States, or Arthur J. Balfour, first lord
of the admiralty, be sent to the United
States with full powers to adjust the
blockade controversy with the govern
ment at Washington. The Guardian
adds:
"British opinion has persistently
overlooked the fact that German di
plomacy possessed two great advan
tages over ours. The first is that the
critical and even hostile attitude of
the American navy towards British
seapower as well as the theories on
which it is based, is almost as old as
the American nation itself. Our last
war with the United States arose out
of what was regarded by America as
an abuse of our power at sea. WTe have
forgotten the details but the United
States has not and both then and now
the United States government regards
itself as the natural champion of neu
tral rights. It is impossible to exag
gerate the influence of these historic
facts on American policy."

THE WAR TODAY
The French have been making
efforts to regain territory they lost -10"
days ago south of the river
Somme but according to Berlin
they were unsuccessful, their at
tack which was preceded by artil
lery preparation being repulsed.
The airmen on this front have
been busy, a German air squad at
tacking an English camp in Bel
gium and although attacked by
allied airmen, returning without
losses.
Petrograd has information that
there have been recent transfers of
large bodies of German troops to
the western front, which is held to
indicate that the Germans are pre
paring to devote the greater part
of their strength to the war areas
in France and Belgium.
Except for the continuation of
the intensive bombardment along
the Franco-Belgian front, there
are few reports of activity from
the major fields of military opera
tions. The Petrograd war office reports
continued advances against the
Turks, both north and south of
Erzerum, the Russian forces hav
ing pressed further westward
along the Black Sea coast and
along the northern shores of Lake
Van.
lteports are current in London
that Field Marshal Earl Kitchener
is to take command of the British
forces in Egypt and that the earl
of Derby, who has been in charge
of recruiting, Is to be the new sec
retary of state for war.
General Polivanoff, Russian
minister of war, is quoted today as
declaring that the Russian muni
tions crisis is now past and that
the system of handling recruits is
snch that the units of the Russian
army can now be kept up to their
full strength with fully trained
men.
The principal fighting In the war
is still along the western front,
where the allies and the Germans
are battering away at one another.
The chief engagements are artil
lery battles near Het Sas, Belgium
and in the Champagne district in
France.
Wliile there is fighting on the
Russian and Italian fronts, noth
ing of a startling nature from any
of the belligerents has come
through.
The Germans are afraid of an
allied air raid on Kiel and have
notified the populace that a steam
siren will give advance notice of a
raid.
The semi-official Overseas News
Agency of Berlin says there are
now 1,429,171 prisoners of war in
Germany.
Prince Oscar, fifth Sua vt Em
peror William, has been wounded
for the second time during the war.
A London newspaper learns that
Earl Kitchener, secretary for war,
is to undertake important service
elsewhere and that Sir William
Roberston, chief of staff, will ac
tively direct the war, and a civil
ian will become secretary of war.
There Is an optimistic feeling in
Washington that the Lusitania case
will be settled amicably.
THREAT SENT
CONGRESS BY
ARMORTRUST
Private Manufacturers At
tempt to Halt Action of
Senate Committee.
MEETS WITH FAILURE
Tactics of Plate Makers De
feated and Recommen
dation Is Passed.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 8. Private
armor plate manufacturers notified
the senate naval committee today that
they would raise the price of armor
plate $200 a ton if congress decideB to
erect or purchase armor plate factor
ies for the government. The commit
tee nevertheless voted to recommend
government plants.
After brief consideration the com
mittee ordered the bill to the senate
authorizing expenditures of $500,000
to equip Mare Island navy yard for
battleship construction and $100,000
to enlarge facilities of the New York
navy yard and the bill to introduce
midshipmen to the first class at. An
napolis next July. These two bills
passed the house yesterday.
Penrose is Spokesman.
Senator Penrose, republican of
Pennsylvania, notified the committee
of the stand of armor plate manufac
turers, those chiefly concerned being
the Bethlehem and the Midvale Steel
companies.
The committee voted, nevertheless
9 to 3 to report favorably Senator Till
man's bill to authorize the secretary
of the navy to provide an armor plate
factory, with a capacity of not less
than 20,000 tons of armor a year. The
bill would appropriate $11,000,000.
Senators Penrose, Lodge and Smith
of Michigan, republicans, voted against
reporting the bill. Chairman Tillman
and Senators Swanson, Bryan, John
son of Maine; Chilton, Phelan and
Pittman, democrats, and Clapp and
Poindexter, republicans, voted for it.
Hold Up Threat Baffled.
"The threat of the armor barons to
hold up the government will not af
fect congress," said Senator Tillman.
We were given to understand that
the armor manufacturers would in
crease their price because government
manufacture of armor plate would
force them to go out of that business
a.d they would charge"" this enormous
increase in order to provide them
selves with an amortization fund. But
I guess we can find a way to stop the
robbers. In time of trouble we could
seize their plants and operate them by
right of eminent domain."
Would Mean $21,000,000 More.
Senators figured that if the armor
plate manufacturers did raise the
price it would cost the government
$24,000,000 extra for armor plate to
complete the five year naval building
program. Senator . Tillman said he
proposed to ask Senator Penrose to
repeat the announcement of the armor
plate manufacturers to the senate.
La Foliette Blocks Action.
Senator LaFollette blocked an at
tempt to pass immediately the pro
posal making available at once $600,
000 to equip the navy yards at New
York and Mare Island, although Chair
man Tillman asked unanimoub con
sent for its immediate consideration
"I think the matter of such import
ance that we should have a written
report," said Senator La Foliette, "and
I object."
GROSS MEXICO IN
ARMORED TRAIN
New York, Feb. 8. Four American
mining engineers who arrived today
from Vera Cruz reported that the
train on which they traveled from
Mexico City to Vera Cruz had been
under constant fire from bandits
throughout the Journey.
The engineers said they left Mexico
City two weeks ago and traveled in
an armored car which carried four
three-inch guns. According to their
story the whole territory between the
Mexican capital and the seacoast is
Infested with bandits.
Dr. John R. Davis, an American
physician at Mexico City, was quoted
as saying there were several thousand
cases of typhus fever in the capital
and that smallpox was raging at Tam
plco. The engineers asserted that Car
ranza's power was waning and that
General Obregon was the man of the
hour In Mexico City.
