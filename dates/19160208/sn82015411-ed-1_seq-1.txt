The above is a complete list of
the ollicers of the Fourth Regiment,
National Guard of Hawaii, as it
stood last night, a few additions
here and there to be made.
Thor-c ollicers will in due course
be assigned to duty in connection
with the work of completing regi
mental organization, but will not
assume t h e i r permanent official
functions in the regiment until on
and after March lil. In the mean
while, the present battalion status
of the local Guard will continue,
and its administrative business will
be carried on by Major Broadbent
and his battalion staff as heretofore.
This will give the new ollicers (re
gimental, battalion and line) a fine
opportunity to become thoroughly
acquainted with their future duties
before entering actively upon them.
The battalion majors have already
been assigned to duty with the com
panies which will make up their
battalions, respectively; and the
new line ollicers will be assigned by
the majors to duty with theelements
which they will, after March 111,
command. Until March 111, head
quarters of the Guard will remain
as at present (Lihue). After that
date the respective headquarters will
be as follows:
Regimental, Grove Farm, Lihue;
First ISattalian, County Building,
Lihue;
Second Battalion, Lawai (Home
stead ptxtollice) ;
Third Battalion, Makaweli.
! "10 FATE
On January 10 a man named
Kim Seung Chill died in Rice's
niauka camp, after drinking ant
poision. He left behind a little
wife named Tark Ha Soon, aged 20.
Mrs. Ha mourned forafewdays,
but the realities of a long life a
lone stared her in the face un
pleasantly. Cupid, however, was
her friend, and steered Kimllurng
fai, a Korean gentleman of 34, her
way. Love-making was evidently
quite speedy, for on Saturday both
(appeared for a license and n few
hours later the tears of a widow
had been exchanged for the smiles
of a happy bride.

KEALiA TROUBLE
QUICKLY A! END
A little trouble among the labor
ers at Kealia at the week-end caused
some excitement, but was happily
settled quickly and without partic
ularly bad results. A Filipino
"bad man," a recent arrival at the
plantation, was at the bottom of
the trouble. In an altercation
with Luna Kennedy, the latter
found occasion to strike the man
and was later himself assaulted by
another Filipino.
Many of the Eilipinoes became
quite excited over the affair and
for a time i t looked like there
might be serious trouble. When
Sheriff Rice arrived, however, the
Filipino who had started thetroublc
offered to leave the island if given
his fare to Honolulu. He was giv
en a ticket, a few dollars to land
with in the city and left by the
steamer Saturday afternoon.
As near as can be ascertained,
there is no real dissatisfaction a
mong the laborers on the estate,
and the cause of the near-riot was
centered in the presence of the
Filipino malihini. who left for
Honolulu.
E
OFFICIAL III
The wireless department of the
Mutual Telephone Company has
made arrangements to give Kajiai
(as well as the other islands) the
official time daily, the service hav
ing already begun. The following
notice relating to the matter was
sent out last Friday:
"Beginning today the Honolulu
office of the Mutual Wireless sys
tem will transmit time signals to
the outside islands bv direct auto
matic connection, the transmitters
at the Wahiawa wireless station
being electrically coupled to the
master clock in the Mutual Tele
phone building, thus ensuring cor
rect time practically down to the
second.
"The master clock is the same
one used to govern the electric
clocks scattered through the city
offices."
The expectation is that the ex
act, official time will be kept in
future by the large clock on the
county building at Lihue, which
will be the standard time-piece of
the island. It may be stated, how
ever, that the big clock has, in the
past, proved anything but reliable,
being more often silent than in its
legitimate business of ticking.
Birthday Party
Mrs. C, B. Hofgaard and Mr.
15. Allen Creevey having birthdays
within a few days of each other,
the two families celebrated with a
birthday dinner at the Creevey's
home in Eleele, last Saturday
evening. Pink roses were used for
table decorations, the color scheme
being further carried out by pink
candleshades and rose place-cards.
Individual birthday cakes contain
ing "fortunes," and decorated
with tiny pink lighted candles
were served each guest. It was n
merry occasion.
Kauai's New Lawyer
Fred Patterson, a young lawyer
of California, has arrived here and
in a few davs will open an office
in the premises formerly occupied
bv Mr. Hannestad. Lihue. He has
! the reputation of being able and
aggressive, and will doubtless
' make a strong bid for business.

E CALL
ON I. L. W. HART
Last Wednesday afternoon, Feb
ruary 2nd, Kekapua was the scene
of a very delightful and interest
ing surprise party, the occasion
being the eightieth hirthday o f
Mr. L. W. Hart, who has been on
the island for many years, and has
worked himself into the he.-.rts of
the people bv his untiring efforts
in literary and Theosophical cir
cles. At four o'clock theautos gather
ed at the little bridge leading into
Kekapua, and about fifty ladies
assembled to do honor to Mr. Hart
by presenting him with a beauti
ful bedside table and breakfast
set, as an expression of their es
teem and respect.
The surprise was a complete
one, but Mr. Hart according to
his usual custom was not at a loss
for words, and made a beautiful
speech thankinir the ladies for
their thoughtful gift and express
ing his deep appreciation of their
kindness.
Refreshments, which had been
arranged for, were served and a
huge cake with eighty lighted
candles was placed before M r.
Hart.
Although well on in years Mr.
Hart still possesses one of the fin
est intellects on the Islands, and
because of his genial and obliging
nature is always willing to place
at the disposal of the various socie
ties of the district, his knowlege
and varied experiences.
The services that Mr. Hart have
rendered in the community have
been highly appreciated by all.

typewriter artist, will arrive on
Kauai tomorrow, accompanied bv

A.-II. Steamers To Discontinue
The American-Hawaiian Steamship Company will abandon the
run between these Islands and the Atlantic coast, and Hawaiian sugar
will be carried bv the railroads to the eastern refineries, with the con
sent of the factors.
It is understood that the reason for the withdrawal :s that twelve
of the big steamers making this run have been chartered to the Ailies
for use as carriers in the war.
The Islands will be hard hit by this arrangement. Three of the
steamers will remain for the New York-San Francisco run,

HEIR APPEARS FOR
VERY OLD ESTATE
Judge L A. Dickev has receiv
ed from the Hawaiian Trust Com
pany copies of letters from a man
claiming to be I'iliwale Kaio. al
though going by an English name
at present. dated at Braxton, Miss.,
in which the writer lays claim to
a half of the Paupau Estate, at
Koloa, this island, of which the
Hawaiian Trust Company, Hono
lulu, is trustee.
If the Mississippi man is really
Pilitvale Kaio, as he claims, he
will fall into quite a little suni, for
there is not only a cash accumula
tion of about SI. 000, but he would
have a half interest in the proper
ty, the other half belonging to a
married sister.
Piliwale Kaio was taken from
Kauai to Honolulu when a very
voung child. Some years ago when
the estate was turned over to the
Trust Company an investigation
was made, and the child-heir was
traced to the States and finally to
Alabama, wheie the clue was lost.
His share in the property has re
mained in the hands of the trust
company ever since, the interest
accumulating trom year to year
until the neat sum indicated above
is now on hands, or will be by
time a settlement can be made with
the man.
The court will probably ask the
Mississippi man to write a letter
in the Hawaiian language and to
produce other proofs of his identity
before steps are taken to turn over
the property to him.
In his letter Kaio Twho gives the
English name of Joe Kenny and
address as Box 15, Braxton, Miss.
asks that S800 be sent him at once.
This, of course, cannot be done

in the Lihue district court yester
day morning on the charge of
criminally assaulting n Chinese
girl under age at Eleele. The gill
and other wttnesses were put on
the stand, after which the accused
was committed to the March term
uf the Circuit Court.
The case enlisted quite a bit of
attention. The accused, a young
Hawaiian, shipped on an outgoing
sailimr vessel shortly after the of
feuse was alleged to have been
committed, the destination of the

Heavy Rains Yesterday
Heavy rains fell yesterday in the
region between Koloa and Eleele

established. The indications are,
however, that he really is the
long-sought heir and will get the
money and other property.
