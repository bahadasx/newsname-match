Bernstorff Makes Appointment to Confer With Secretary
Lansing Again Cabinet Meeting Will Consider the
( Matter Today
Washington, Feb. 8. Naught but Germany's absolute
admission that the Lusitania torpedoing was illegal,
coupled with a disavowal thereof, will be acceptable to
this government, according to high administration
sources today.
This word came simultaneously with a conference be
tween Secretary of State Lansing and President Wilson
in the latter's private office. From the conference, was
expected to result a decision as to the acceptability of
Germany's so-called "last word" in the case.
German information was that the Berlin memorandum
) ractically meets the administration terms and that
"Germany had left little for the United States to con
cede." Administration authorities yesterday, however,
did not agree that it had gone thus far.

ALL SERENE AGAIN
Washington, Feb. . T'nof
ficial announcement after a half
hour conference be-two we wn
Ambassador Von Bernstorff and
.Secretary of State Lansing this
afternoon was that Lansing had
informed the German envoy
that the Lusitania memorandum
is practically satisfactory, but
needs certain changes. This may
iecessitnte - further communica
Hon with Berlin.
Washington, Feb. 8. Son e of t'ue
optimism pervaded German circles over
the Lusitania situation received a sharp
setback today when a high government
official said he could not believe Teu
ton officials are sincere in their ex
pressed belief that the United States
would be satisfied with the litest Ber
lin proposals for settlement of the case.
"If they believe that, they have no
conception of the mind of the admin
istration," said the official.
Another official in discussing the
German attempt to differentiate be
tween the torpedoing of ships and the
slaughter of neutials, insisted that the
sinking is neither leg.il or justifiable,
and that the "killing of Americans
cannot be separated from the sinking. "
This party indicated more strongly
than ever that it is necessary for Ger
many to make some admission of the il
legality of the Lusitania incident.
It wis expected today that if the
cabinet considered the latest German
memorandum, Ambassador Von Bern
storff would go to the state depart
ment this afternoon or tomorrow to
learn the result of their decision.
Secretary Lansing conferred with
the president at 10 o'clock presumably
about the Lusitania else, prior to at
tending the cabinet meeting at 11
o 'clock.
More Hopeful View.
Washington, Feb. 8. The diplomatic
situation arising from the Lusitania
torpedoing looks very hopeful, the
White House said today, following a
conference between the president and
Secretary of State Lansing.

This statement came from a high of
ficial, who said also that matters had
not readied a stage tangible enough to
warrant m official announcement. It
is understood his hopeful view was
based on the extent to which Ambas
sador Von Bernstorff 's memorandum
went in making concessions. Germany,
it is said, has left the way open for
further concessions.
It is known tiiat negotiations are
likely to continue, with the adminis
tration confident tint an adjustment
can be reached on its terms. Certain
recent events are hinted to have had a
strong bearing on the situation. Wheth
er these "events" were summed up in
the report fo Colonel House or in com
munications to Ambassador Von Bern
stoiff is unknown, but is believed the
former idea is the more probable.
Ambassador Bernstorff nnd Secre
tary Lansing made an engagement for
a conference today.
The administration is hopeful that a
satisfactory settlement maye be reach
ed within i day probably at the Von
Bernstorff-Lansing conference this af
ternoon. Lansing was to tell him what the
government had decided about the last
Berlin memorandum. The situation is
now up to Von Bernstorff, but hope for
an agreement was based on the report
that the memorandum leaves a loophole
for additional concessions by Germany.

ALL IMPORTANT MATTERS
Government and Armor Plate
Trust May Indulge In
Contest
Washington, Feb. 8. Passago of the
most important democratic legislation
in a single "omnibus bill" is the dur
ing political strategy democratic lead
ers today are considering. The house
ways and means committee will meet
Thursday to consider tho proposal as
presented by Representative Gardner.
He suggested inclusion of tho fol
lowing measures in the one bill:
Revision of the income tax.
Levying of new inheritance taxes.
Bcpeal of tho war stamp taxes.
Increase of the duties on whiskey
and cigars.
Taxation of munitions.
Creation of a tariff commission, aj
desired by President Wilson.
Enactment of an "anti-dumping"
clause in tho trust laws, in order to pre
vent cutthroat competition from Eu
rope nt the end of the war.
Retention of the sugar duty.
Repeal of the tax on mixd flour.
Leaders plan t increase the whiskey
tax 15 cents a gallon and change the
cigar tax from tie basis of numbers to
that of value. These moves would raise
$:;.V)00,)00. it it estimated, thus re
placing $3:i,00iy).iO trorfii of stamp tax
scnedtiled for t. ',- ';
While tlu increased tax on wniskcy
is bound to meet with concrtod oppo
sition from many liquor interests, lead
ers are inclined to believe that such a
move would be more popular than tho
stamp tax. "Dry" members will give
sucii a plan their ardent support, wmle
other members are likely to support it
li oni the standpoint ot political and
economic expediency.
After Armor Plate Trust.
Washington, Feb. 8. Tho govern
ment and the armor plate makers are
preparing for a fight. Tho senate na
val committee has already recommend
ed passage of the bill for government
manufacture of armor plate, but this

ommendation, Senator Penrose warned

LAMAR
'It is too early to determine wlicth-
Henry Ford's Peace Expedition is
a failure or a success," said Lamar
Tooze, student representative of tho
University of Oregon on the peace
mission, in an interview today. Mr.
Tooze arrived in Salem this morning
directly from Now Vork and is visiting
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Walter L.
Tooze. "The practical results tiiat
have ensued and will ensue by reason
of Mr. Ford's attempt lie wholly in the
future. I am firmly convinced that up
to tho present time the expelitioii
proper accomplished all that it set out
accomplish. As 1 understand the
program, the two primary purposes ol
the expedition proper were, first, to at
tract world-wide attention to the cause
of peace; and in the second dace, to
enlist the support of the neutral coun
tries of Europe, both active and moral.
Judging by tho newspaper comments in
all countries visited, not always tavor
able it is true, the expedition attract

each country that was visited sent a
representative representation fulfills
tlie second object of the trip. It is now
up to the neutral conference, composed
of five unofficial representatives euch
from America, Norwav, Sweden, Den
mark an 1 Holland to demonstrate the
efficacy of the plan. All of the other
steps, in my opinion, have been satis
factorily covered.
"The real work of the expedition
will be started when tho neutral con
ference meets. No one can predict with
any dgree of certainty as to the re
sults that will follow the efforts of the
conference.
"There is one thing certain. And
that is that the personnel of the Am-
erienn membership is of the h.gnest
calibre. I ho American members as sc-
lected by the delegates are: Mr. ord,
William Jennings Bryan, Miss Jano.wni.,h n,,.,,,:,.,., ii nf .., Htll(ipn(.
Addnms, Mrs. Joseph Fels and Dr,
Charles F. Aked. The first three are
too well known to require any state
ment as to their ability. Mrs. Fels is
the widow of the late Joseph Fels, the
Philadelphia soap manufacturer and is
well known in Europe because of her
social work tiiere. Her acquaintance
with European conditions will be a true
advantage to the conference. Dr. Aked,
although a former British subject, is
brondminded and will not let his past
allegiance interfcro with an unbiased
view of the European situation. The
coufernce will draw up proposals of
peace to bo presented simultaneously
to the belligerent nations with the hope
fhat all will agree sooner or later upon
some proposal or part of a proposal.

TOOZE.
With this common ground as a founda-
tion, the conference expects to rear the
superstructure of permanent world
peace. Fxisting military advantage
will not be considered in framing the
proposals. A permanent peace, or none
nt all, will be the slogan of tho con
ference. That a temporary arrange
ment would be suicidal is tho sentiment
of every member who accompniiied Mr.
Ford, 1 venture to say. For instance,
1 belicvo every impartial Ameri
can citizen would not favor any pro
posal that did not contain provisions
tor the re-cstablishnient of Belgium s
sovereignty or a lusting settlement of
the Balkan situation. Any other but
permanent peace would but mean tho
recurrence of the great world strug
gle. The uivofficiul conference will
automatically dissolve as soon as offi
cial negotiations are commenced. It
has no idea of embarrassing interna
tional diplomacy.
"The best feature of the plan is its
simplicity.
"Naturally, many amusing things
occurred on tho expedition. Thero
wero many differences of opinion on
subsidiary questions such as American
military preparedness. Nothing else
could have been expected from such i
group or individuals, hi keeping with
Mr. Ford's 'community ' idea, tho ex
pedition contained people representing
many different parts of the country,
many ililterent opinions and many dif
ferent ideals. However, thero was ono

tion of peace in Europe.
