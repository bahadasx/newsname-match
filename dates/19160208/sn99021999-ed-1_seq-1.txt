"WASHINGTON. Feb. 7. Speaker
Clark and Republican Leader Mann
fought aide by side in the house to
day for adequate- national defense
With party lines obliterated most of
the members followed their leaders
.and two nary measures passed with
out a dissenting vote. One to pro
vide for adding 300 midshipmen to
the entering class at Annapolis next
July, passed 173 to 0; and the other
to eciuip navy yards for construction
of batleshlps Nos. 43 and 44, passed
without a roll call.
Mr.-Mann tried to put the anti
preparedness advocates on record by
calling for a division on the naval
academy bill, but there were no neg
ative responses.
Clark Appears na Floor.
The appearance of Speaker Clark on the
floor to champion preparedness meas
ures aroused wide interest. Rumors per
sisted that he .would take active charge
of the fighting to increase the army and
navy; Majority Leader Kitchin having
Joined .the opposition.
Immediate improvement of the navy by
designing new battleships along; the lines
of the best now in use. doubling tha mem
bership of both Annapolis and West
Point, creation of many additional regi
ments for the army and short term en
listments to produce a reserve were
among suggestion made by the speaker.
He Said he expected to discuss tha sub
ject of preparedness generally soon.
Mr. Mann reiterated his previous plans
for a larger army and navy and aided In
-maneuvering the bills to passage. "This
Is not the time for crimination and re
crimination." said he. "It Is not the time

Th, debate went far. afield from the
measures tinder consideration extending
tha general subject of military 'prepared

and the minority leader battling together
for administration' measures while the
majority leader sat silently in tha back
of the bouse attracted crowds- to the
galleries and members rushed to the floor
from their offices and committee rooms.
'Mr.-Clark urged haste in getting new
battleships into -commission. He ' asked
Chairman Padgett -of the 'rxava, Icommtt-
tee why-It would not be a good plan to
pattern the two battleships Nos 43 and
44 after the best United Statea ship afloat
and get them cdmpleted quickly.

the then President Roosevelt afterward
declared would cause that congress to be
memorable In history because of Us con
structlve legislation. Of tha five acts,
four came from Colonel Hepburn's com
mittee . and three of them the Hepburn

WASHINGTON. Feb. 7. Ap
proval has not been given by Presi
dent Wilson and democrats of the
senate are by no means unanimously
in favor of amendments 'to the
Colombia treaty reported last week
by the senate foreign relations' committee.
It developed today that a strong
effort probably would be made In
the senate to defeat the changes
which would reduce the proposed In
demnity to Colombia for the parti
tion of Panama from $25,000,000
to 115.000,000 and to revise the
wording of the expression of regret
Calls oa Laaslnrf.
Minister Betancourt of Colombia called
on- Secretary Lansing during the day and
Was assured that the president had not
given his approval to either of the
amendments. letter It became known that
many of the democrats of the foreign
relations committee opposed the change.
A republican, Senator Smith of Mich
igan, by changing his vote on a tie In the
committee carried the amendment reduc
ing the indemnity by IIO.OW.WW.
"I voted against the amendment first,'
Said Senator Smith today, "because I am
opposed to the treaty. I am opposed to
the fulled ' States paying one dollar to
Colombia. But when I saw how close the
committee stood on the issue, I concluded
that 115,000,000 was tlO.000.000 leas than
125.000.000 and I changed my vote. Now I
am glad of it because I see It has started
a row."

When Dr. Zimmermen's statement wss
