BIG LEVEE Will
SOON BE
Within Nsxt Sixty Days Work In
Drainage District No. 1 Will
Be Completed.
After overcoming msny trials and
difficulties, and after being delayed
from man? and varied things over
which they had no control the men
having In charge the construction of
the big levee In drainage dUtrlrt No.
1, Burleson County, have about
brought their work to a clone, and
within the next sixty days It Is be
lieved that this great project alilch
means so much to the people of this
country will have been completed and
0,000 acres of lund will be above the
ravages of high water.
Itoubtlcss a great many people are
not very familiar with the difficulties
encountered or the actual cum! and
worth of this big undertaking, so the
Eagle bellevea that a few lines of
history In connection therewith will
not be out of place. This dlHtrli t was
organised and known as nurlewm
County drainage district No. 1. or
ganised under an act of the leglitlii
ture of 1 .", but the sllorn.y general
held that the dUtrii t did not ajply to
that law bccati the nii'thihU em
ployed tended more to keeping off
water than In carrying it asy.
In 1009 the legislature enacted an
Improvement district law under which
all obstacles were removed In so far
s this distric t was concerned, and
the district was reorganized and
!:iS,3?0 orth of Ixinds Issued. Con
struction work on the project wan un
dertaken in 1910. On Dec. 3. I'.'ll.
the big overflows occurred at which
time all levees In Texas overtopped
and caused more or less damage.
On Aug. 2. 1SU. an election for the
issuance of additional bonds to com
plete the work wss held resulting In
$13M5 being voted. However, in the
early part of January preceding this
election, three miles of the origins!
levee that had been destroyed at the
upper end of the district waa recon
structed by the public enterprise of
the cltlinns In that end of the llratos
Valley who advanced RZH.OOO In cesh
In order that the work might proceed
and which waa wisely expended, as
was later (proved, when a big over
flow came and had It not been for this
preliminary work In advance of the
bond Issue, more than o,nn acres of
splendid Isnd would have become In
undated. In April of '.:, when the
first severe flood came after the con
struction of the levee 12.000 acres
were protected at the upiier end of
the district by the levee, and had all
the gaps been completed at that time
more than twice that amount of land
would have been aaved from overflow.

on the Job early and late since lit 10.
and he has eMubllnliel an enviable
reputation, both us tj l.j ability and
also as a very pleasant, courteous and

We believe that the people who will
have to pay the taxea to meet the

prove a money saver, but a lund saxer
