hinted too, that Germany in this

for further concessions If necessary.
It became known also that negotia

on the basis It has laid down. Certain

"hopeful" that a satisfactory settle

Von Bernstorff last week and this

In view of the fact the memorandum
Is said to have indicated additional

it is believed that changee in the

LONDON, Feb. 8.—Rumors that the
German fleet is preparing for ita long
expected dash into the North sea
reached here today from Dutch
sources and aroused high hopes In
London that a great naval battle Is
imminent In the North ses.
Dlspatehea from The Hague report*
ed that German marines along the
Belgian coast are being withdrawn
and sent to Kiel. All leaves of «b
aenee of German naval offloera have
been cancelled, the dispatches added.
From Copenhagen came reports of
sudden activity at Kiel and of rumors
reaching Danish frontier towna that
the Qermana were about to risk
battle. Four Zeppellna and a flock of
German taubes have reinforced the
air flotilla at the German naval baee.
The supposition Is that they are to
accompany the fleet In Ita sortie from
behind the protecting guns and mine
flelda of Heligoland.
Vague rumors that the Yeuton
naval officers were about to attempt
a startling coup poured Into London,
even before the exploits of the Ger
man commerce raider that captured
the Appam became known. 8lnoe the
Appam reached Norfolk aeveral Ber
lin dlspatehea have carried aimilar

A recent report was that the Ger

dreadnoughts with 17 Inch guns and
had armed Zeppellna with devlcea for

paratory to ehallenglng the Brltiah

WASHINGTON, Feb. 8.—Landing
of an invading amy of 600,000 men
in this countiy will be impossible if
our submarines were active—General
Nelson A. Miles.
The American navy could reach the
Pacific coast before a forelgin enemy
—Admiral Blue, chief of tbe naviga
tion bureau.
These were two breaks In a long
line of pessimistic testimony pre
sented before the house military and
naval affairs committee today. Blue
said the Panama «anal would enable
the fleet to reach the Pacific before
any fleet could cross It. He urged
purchase of many anti-air craft guns
and opposed Speaker Clark's sugges
tion of one year enlistments.
Miles declared conscription would
not work in this country.
"If 500,000 men were landed on
either of our coasts and we were not
able to raise enough men to drlvs
them out, I would want
to
move to an­
other country," ha said.
Qoast" for!lfl«**inu» Of t»» dMted
States, General. Miles said, were
equal to those any place In the'world
not excepting the fortifications of the
Dardanelles. Heavy guns on battle*
ships had failed entirely, he said, to
show their effectiveness during the
European war, against fortifications.
Overseas expeditions, such as we are
told will proceed against the United
States, are expensive and as a rule
disastrous, he said. "If subjects wera
ordered by on European country to
cross the water to America, I believe
they would refuse because ot their
fear of meeting a liberty loving na
tion of men defending their own
homes. These ovtr-sea expeditions
spring from the minds of men writing
about preparedness, who know leas
about war than anything else.
"Conscription would utterly fall In
the United States," he said, "as dem
onstrated during the civil war when
active troops were withdrawn from
the field at Gettysburg to suppress
draft riots at Philadelphia."
General Miles admitted the need of
enlarging the United States army to
140,000, recommending skeleton regi
ments so that their strength could be
expanded in case of fear of Invasion,
to 400,000 by offering double pay to
men who have seen service.
