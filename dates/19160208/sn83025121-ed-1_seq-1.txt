The speaker, in the course of his re

redoubled their activity of the last few
days, until even Berlin admits that
artillery engagement of "terrific in
tenuity ' ' are in progress in that region.
Reports of continued friction be

due to ail Friday. The main American-Hawaiian fleet will go into
the war trade.
itlei tiations between the American Hawaiian line and the Sugar
Ffcctor have been in progress three days, at least, and probably
longer For the Sugar Factors it was stated yesterday that the
negoti;iti' ns had not been comsummated, but this statement is be
lieved to mean that final formalities of signing contracts remain,
for it was learned from sources of unquestioned reliability that cable

sent of the-Sugar Factors to the plan,
beeause the American-Hawaiian is un
der contiact to them for the transport
ing of ." : t m 1 1 ) h i tuns of sugar during the
year. Hum tor ti.e settlement is the
absorption of all the increased expense
of rail iliipmciit, and extra handling,
by the American-Hawaiian, it is tin
derstood on high authority. In other
words, the line will deliver the sugar
to the Kasteru refineries by trauscon
tineaitaJ haul at th all-water con
tract rale. It ia considered certain
that nunc of it will be refined ou the
coast.
This must not be taken to Indicate
that the American Hawaiian intends to
abandon the Hawaii trade. It ia
regarded as prohable that the regular
av be resumed when the Pana
service in
ma Canal can be used with positive as
surance that it no longer will be block
ed by slides.
No recent development in shipping
has been el such profound importance
to the Islands. It means more than tho
withdrawal of the Pacific Mail, for the
American llawuiiau is peculiarly au Is
land company.
Honolulu Merchants Bit Hard
As fei s iar itself, the change may
be an nhantn);c. Merchants who hnvu
been rc citing most of their Eastern
freight li.v the all water route will be
hit hanl, tor they will have to pay
higher freight istes and probably will
be dela.ved In receiving shipments by
reanon of the railroad congestion in

pushed t handle the business from
Puget Sound and Sun Francisco. It is
eutireh possilde that the Increased

the schedule calls for the Kentuckian,
M xn un, llouolulan, Texan, (Jeorgiau

uled to sail from New York on Fri
day, but the Floridan evidently hat
been sul itituted. The Ohioau is ex
pected to sail from II Uo for New York
within a day or so. Since three steam
ers ure to be left on tne Pacific, four
will remain to be loaded for New York,
so it is to be expected that there will
he that number of cargoes five with
that of the Ohioaa still to go via

the first cargo will go to Ban Fran
