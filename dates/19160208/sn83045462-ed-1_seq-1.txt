Private armor plate manufacI
turers notified the Senate naval
; committee today that they would
raise the price of armor plate S^oc
a ton if Congress decides to erect
or purchase armor-plate factories
for the government. The committee
nevertheless voted to recommend
government plants.
! Senator Penrose, republican, of Penni
sylvania notified the committee of the
i stand of the armor plate manufacturers,
those chiefly concerned being tlie Bethlehem
and Midvale steel companies.
Bill Would Appropriate $11,000,000
The committee voted, nevertheless. 9 to
3. to report favorably Senator Tillman's
biil to authorize the Secretary of the
Navy to provide either by erection or
purchase of an armor plate factory, or
both, with capacity of not less than -0,000
tons of armor a year. The bill would
appropriate $11,000,000. Senators Penrose.
Lodge and Smith of Michigan, republicans.
voted against reporting the
bill.
Chairman Tillman and Senators
Swanson. Bryan. Johnson (Maine),
Chilton. Phelan and Pittman, denio,
crats. and Clapp and Poindexter, republicans.
voted for it.
'The threat of the a'mor barons to
hold up the government will not affect
'Congress." said Senator Tillman.
"We were given to understand that
the armor manufacturers would increase
their price 'because government
manufacture of armor plate would
force them to go out of that business
and they would charge this enormous
increase in order to provide themselves
with an amortization fund. But
1 guess we can find a way to stop the
robbers. In time of trouble we could
seiz^ their plants and operate them by
right of eminent domain."
Other Bills Favored.
j After brief consideration, the coin1
niittee ordered favorably reported the
| bill authorizing expenditure of $500,00C
j to equip Mare Island navy yard for

enlarge facilities of the New York navy
yard, and the bill to add 300 midship!

committee agreed to consider his bill
which would appropriate 510.000.000 for

, furnish the committee with data on

visions in the pending army bill to prof

daily. Thousands of men whe

Germans Worked Smoothly.
5 The German organization, on the

: 89.-"> per cent of the wounded sent tc

friends to hamstring the Weeks
betom.
If .Mr. Hrandei> is confirmed a;
associate justice of the Supreme
Court, it is said that Mr. Justice
Hughes may eliminate himsell
from any possibility of being
nominated at Chicago. Some oi
the more cynical of the politician;
declare that they see in the nomination
of Mr. flrandeis a Machiavellian
purpose on the part oi
President Wilson to rid himsell
of a formidable opponent bv
pinning Mr. Justice Hughes tc
the Supreme bench.
Might Open Way for Radical.
It is stated as a fact by persons in
position to know that since the Brandefs
nomination pressure has been
i>rought to bear on Air. Justice Hughes
to induce him to put himself out of all
consideration for the presidency and
remain on the bench. The argument
advanced is that his departure from the
court would offer opportunity for the
appointment of another democrat and
possibly a radical.
Jt is well understood by ali, of course
that Mr. Justice Hughes has done all
that ethics require of him to avoid be
ing a presidential candidate. He hat
prohibited the use of his name in thf
primaries. But politicians have said
that if the convention should stamped*
to him he might accept.
Only on*- thing more could be done
and that would be to declare that ir
no circumstances would he accept the
. nomination if tendered. It is easil>
imagined what a tload would he liftec
off the mind of Mr. Burton, Mr. Fairbanks.
Mr. Weeks. Mr. Cummins and
others, as well, if such announcement
' were made.
Somebody "Spilled the Beans."
; Somebody "down east" has apparently
started in. to use a simile local tc
Boston, to "spill the beans" for Sena
tor Weeks. The report is being assiduously
circulated that Senator Weeki
intends to retire from the presidentia
! race and that his strength will go t<
! j Gov. McCall of his own state. Up tt
I this time Gov. McCall has not seen fi
to deny that he has presidential as
pirations, and it is said that New Eng
land republicans are highly incensec
5 over the situation.
: According to these New En glanders
there could be put one result of a con
' test between Weeks and McCall, anc
i that would be that the country woulc
I say "a plague on both your houses'
| and eliminate New England from fur

I It is stated on authority that Mr

' but. on the contrary, will loom uj

Tension in German Capital

February S.?Tension in what is called
here the Lusitania crisis was lessened
somewhat today as a result of more favorable
news from America, which was

newspapers.
Practically every newspaper in Gerinany

energetically contests statements of
the American newspapers, as reported
in the Frankfurter Zeitung. to the effect
that tiie solution of the crisis is
now merely a matter of foriri. since

It says finally that America, because
of the fact that merchantmen now are
almost invariably armed, must recognize
submarine warfare as legal, and
that "real neutrality could not lead
to any other conclusion."
The Tagelische Rundschau expresses
satisfaction that Herr Zimmermann "has
at last taken up the only stand possible
for our government in maintenance
of the national dignity and of the
needs of our national life. Mr. Wilson,
and he only, can render the decision."
