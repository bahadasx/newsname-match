The committee voted, nevertheless,
nine to three, to report favorably Sen

retary of the navy to provide either by
erection or purchase of an armor plate
factory, or both, with a capacity of not
less than 100,000 tons of armor per
year. The bill would appropriate $11,

Says Tillman.
The threat of the armor barons to
hold up the government wilj not affect
congress,? jsaid Senator Tillman. "We
were given to understand that the man
ufacturers would increase their, price
because government manufacture of
armor plate would force them to go
out of that business and they would
charge this enormous increase in order
to provide themselves with an amorti
zation fund. But I guess we can find
a way to stop the robbers. In time of
trouble we could seize their plants and
operate them by right pf eminent do
main."
House Passes-Bills.
Two house measures to strengthen
tlie navy went over to the senate to
day. One was a bill to provide for add
ing 300 midshipmen to the entrance
class at Annapolis next July and the
other calls for equipping of the navy
yards at New York and Mare Island
for the construction of battleships No.

Speaker Champ Clark took the lead
in urging passage of the two measures
In the house. He was strongly sup
ported by 'Representative Mann, the
minority leader, with the result that
party lines were obliterated and both
measures passed the house without a
dissenting vote.
Red Cress Wants Legislation.
Mabel T, Boardman. of the Ameri
can Red Cross, before the house mili
tary committee today urged provision
In the army bill for co-ordination for
Red Cross work. Authority should be
given the secretary of war, she said, to
detail officers to the Red Cross, for the
purpose of facilitating the work in war
time and to permit of construction of
Bed Cross warehouses on government
reservations.
Miss 'Boardman described' the Red
Cross pUuis for its part in prepared
ness. Six thousand trained nurses al
ready are enrolled.
•Senators figured that if the armor
-nlate manufacturers did not raise the
price It would cost the government
$24,000,000 extra for armor plate to
complete the five year naval building
program.
LaFollette Blocks Hurried Action.
Senator LaFollette blocked an at
tempt to p*«s immediately the pro
nosals making available at once $600,

"I think tit&t a matter of such im

ALLIES DESPISE AMERICANS.
Richard Harding Davis Says All War
ring Nations Dislike Us.
New York, Fefo. 8.-—Other voyagers
from Burope have said Americans are
unpopular in France and England, but
Richard Harding Davis, author and
war correspondent, raised the state
ment to the lajit degree of emphasis
when he arrived on the Baltic.
"Wheii jtou meet a man on the other
side you have to take minutes to
c*Ini him,.after you tell him you are an
American," he said. "They don't hate
us—they save that for the Germans.
They d«fepise us.

portrait appeared there was a solid
hiss Irom the whole audience.
"There are two reasons for their con
tempt. One of them, they hold, is
that the United States has meekly suf
fered all the indignities of Germany's
submarine outrages and has passed its
time protesting indignantly against the
cotton embargo.
"The other is they believe we are
false friends. You know the French
army found when they bought shells
from Americans a number of shells fell
about 500 yards from the mouth of the
gun. They bought shoes from us and
found they were made of paper in
stead of leather.
"Such things have become generally
known, ^nd the French have an idea
that we are trying to earn money out
of their misfortune.
"Our gifts to Belgium? Of course,
they appreciate such things. But you
must remember wc have not sent such
a great deal. All we have sent to Bel
gium would not have fed the country
for seven weeks. France and England
have done the rest, and what we *have
sent over has come from people of
moderate means in this country.
"The big men, those who are earning
the millions out of the war, are giv
ing nothing. They may give a few dol
lars when they are asked, but not in
any proportion to the fortunes they aro
reaping.
"I know that the head of one of the
French committee recently petitioned
about twelve of the biggest men in this
country to give some share of their
war fortunes to help the sufferers. I
was told that not only were there no
