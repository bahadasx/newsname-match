DOC COOK IS BACK
WANTS VINDICATION
Dr. Frederick A. Cook, photographed
a few days ago in Washington.
Washington, Feb. 8.—Dr. Fredrick
A. Cook, the same "Doc" who said he
had discovered the North Pole but
who, scientists said, was slightly mis
taken, is back in Washington again,
seeking vindication. He says he has
started the machinery to bring about
a congressional investigatioA and that
he will not let '.up until his story of
his travels In the arctic are proven
true by congress.
As a' preliminary to his present
campaign he had gone around the
world and added two more discover
ies to his list. One is that the wild
men of Borneo, whom P. T. Barnum
first brought to the attention of civ
ilization, -are light complexioned, pos
sess intellect and have been much
maligned. His other discovery Is a
new hair tonic, it is cold air. The
"Doc" says hot air will not start any
thing worth while.
The only disappointing thing about
his latest trip was that he did not
climb. Mount Hverest, to Ithe Himala
yas, the highest -k^own mountain in
the world, aq 1& bad planned to do.
He was ready- and the 29,002 foot
mountain was there, but in Calcutta
the American consul general told him
no one would be permitted to go on
an exploration.
But the "Don" just had to discover
something, so he picked out the wild
men of Borneo and he had a lovely
visit with them.
"They have been pictured," he said,
"as a hairy lot of wild devils who
don't know anything. As a matter of
fact they are fine specimens. The men
are head hunters but not cannibals,
and they only take the heads of their
enemies. Some so-called civilized
people do that."
"Doc" says he got a very kindly
reception in Denmark that the Dan
ish people still regard him as the real
discoverer of the pole and that he still
has the medals and honors conferred
upon him by the
king.<p></p>FORMFLTLOCAL
