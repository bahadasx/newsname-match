St. Louis Bar Association ,'0,u'r'p1 """ im. iii.-ii com-
Hears Address by Mis
souri Professor.
Ill Isldor l.oeb, dean ot the Uni
versitj faculty, addressed the St
Louis I!ur Associatioji at Ihe llniver
sit Cluli in St. Louis last night on
"The Need for a New Constitu'ion."
Dean l.oeb gave fifteen reasons
why a new constitution is needed for
MHsouri. He said that the present
constitution contains about 30,000
words, or about six times as many as
the constitution 01 me unueu aiaies.
Following, in condensed form, arei
the fifteen reasons he gave:
1. The present constitution, franv
ed in 1S75, is filled with restrictions
which hinder the development of the
state.
2. Constitutions should cover only
the most important questions of our
government. There is too much de
tail in the present constitution.
3 The mass of detail is responsible
for present inability to fit our go em
inent to meet new conditions.
4. Amendment system of meeting
new conditions has failed. Thirty
nine amendments have been submitted
in last eight years. Only four of them
have been adopted. The ballot is so
long that intellectual oting is im
possible. Ta Svstem Defective.
5. The tax system is the most con
spicuous defect of the present con
stitution. Many changes must be
made to equalize the tax burden.
C. The present general property
tHX is unfair and unjust, especially
to farmers and agricutural districts.
7. Local assessors and local boards
of equalization often make counties
paj unfair taxes. The State Hoard of
Equilizatlon, composed of five busy of
ficials, has not the time to devote to
the problem.
S. Rates of taxation and the public
debts of counties, cities and towns,
and school districts are so limited
that they can hardly meet necessary
operation expenses.
9. Our court system as fixed by
the constitution is incapable of meet
ing present-day conditions, as is shown
by excessive delays In litigation and
the consequent denial of justice.
Roads and Schools Suffer.
10. Agricultural in'crests suffer bo
cause real estate and tangible farm
propei ty bear an unjust portion of
state taxes. Adequate systems of good
roads and good schools are impossible
under present system.
11 Public education, from the le-
mentary schools to the State Univer
sitv, suffer from inadequate support,
although one-third of the state revenue
Is devoted to them.
12. Only Missouri cities of more
than 100,000 population have the right
to frame their own constitutions.
13. Out-of-date provisions relating
to suffrage and elections are fixed by
the present constitution.
14. As important as any other
question is the reduction of the num
ber of elective offices so that the peo
ple may vote for the few important
officials in whom they are really In
terested. 13. The powers of the initiative,
referendum and recall for counties
and cities are doubtful or impossible
under the present constitution, as is
also the power .to own and operate
public utilities except water works
and lighting plants.

'OP Thealer Case.
The case of Mrs Ollie l'.irncs i
against .lames Mourhiii. candidate for
the Democratic nomination for Gov
ernor, is to be tiied in the circuit
court at Moberlv this week, on change
of venue from Columbia. Mrs. Rarnes
is suing for $7,000 damage.
The suit conies from the old M thea
ter case whiih was brought up in Co
lumbia in the spring of 1913. Mr.
Houcliin filed a suit of attachment
against the theater on a note held by
him against C. I). Turner, who owned
the theater and had deeded it to Mrs.
Iiarnes. The attachment was allowed
by the Kansas City Court of Appeals,
to which Houchin's attorneys appealed
it from the Circuit Court. The thea
ter was sold, bringing about $400.
Mrs. Barnes bases her present suit
on the allegations that Joseph Mayer, i
one of the attornevs of .Mr. Houchin.
had circulated rumors damaging the
title of the theater and causing it to
be sold for about one-third of its real
value.

With Europe Reduced to
Essentials of Living, Artists
Will Flock to U.S.
In the lu-vt the years, aiusle in
Aiueiiea will make Jiftj times the ad-
ance that it has made in the last
twenty-live. '
Another effect ot the war was thus
se forth in an interview this morn
ing by O.-car Seagle, baritone, who
, will sing at the University Auditorium
! t!lis evening. -Mr. Seagle is stopping
, !lt "" Columbia Club.
"Things in the musical world are
. jn a t n because of the war heJ
continued. 'Musicians must come to
America to live, for Europe is busy
lighting now, and will devote Itself
to essentials for the next five or six
ears. As a result of this influx,
our great American musicians, who
have been get ing five times what they
were actuall worth, will be forced to
low r their prices People who have
neer heard the great pianists and
singers and violinists may well afford
to hear them twice a jear. The
popularity of a musician will be de
termined bj his real wor h, and not
lij the price of tickets to his con
certs. Commends Phi 31 u Alpha.
"The work Phi Mn Alpha is doing,"
said Mr. Seagle, "expresses the most
ideal way of meeting the problem of
spreading musical culture to put
meri- and worth above the clink of
coin. 1 am surprised at the number
of gnat artists jou have heard this
year. It is an exceptional case for a
little town.
"Although few people know it, I
.have been singing for 'weiity-two
i J ears. ' started in Minneapolis wheal
'1 was 17 je:r. old, went to Xew
York, and fiuallv, eleven ears ago,
' aris. where I studied under the
great Jean iVHeszke. M association
with many of the great musicians of
Europe has infant a grea deal to me
in my work. Here in America there
is not the carnal aderie 6u find in
European musical circles. There the
great musicians like to enjoy them
sehrs. Thej tire of the strain of so
cietj. and they congregate in quiet
cafes where they may relax and be
themselves it is this sid of the life
that means so much to the young
musician in Europe. The exchange of
views with great men of his profes
sion broad ns his own viewpoint, a
,,"U','"",,,J" "hivh ' '"' a- "cces-
try as the development of technique.
Hard Vrk Is Essential.
"The on trait absolutely necessary
for a great musician is the ability to
ccjiei ntra'e on one subject. I re
member the first time I heard the
wonderful tenor voice of IVRezke, I
said to nijself. 'It is a gift of God.
He was horn wi li it." I have learned
that the gift of God is the capacity for
endless work. Caruso, when he first
started to sing, at the age of 23 years,
had a m-liow, white, small voice. He
a tempted heavy operas, and gradu
ally developed his powerful voice of
today. Work alone did it. He en
,ir(,,-v '"augpd the character of his
voice.
'.Mine. Schuiiiann-Heink, when she
got her first engagement, was barely
able to pay her railroad fare to the
German town where she was to sing.
Af er the concert the conductor sent
her away, and said that she would
iK-ver make anything or her voice.
Work did it."
At the request of a student in the
University, Mr. Seagle will sing
Handel's "Largo" as an encore to
night, lie may also sing "Ninety and
Nine.'

HOLDS THAT LUXURY
IS WORSETuJlN WAR
Dr. C. A. Ell wood Declares
for Worth-While Living
in Y.M.C.A. Talk.
TAKES UP U.S. POLICY
Would Have Strengthening
of Present Forces but
No Aggression.
"I would rather see our Mood
poured out on the field ot battle than
see jou waste your life in a 'namby
pamby' sort of existence, placing em
phasis on sport and ttlvial matters,"
said Or. C. A. Ellvvood, professor of
sociology, in his lecture last night be
fore the Forum of the Y. M. C. A. Dr.
Ellvvood spoke on "Lessons the Unit
ed States May I?arn From the War."
"After all. the worst things in the
woild arc not death," he continued.
"It is said with much truth that the
youths of England were so debauched
by the trivialities of life that they
could not awaken to the gravity of the
situation presented by the war. This
conflict teaches us to beware of tri
lling, effeminate luxury. Let us arouse
ourselves and face the situation!"
In discussing the causes of the
war, Doctor Ellvvood called attention
to a painting by A. W. Rimmlngton,
which hangs In an art gallery In Lon
don. This painting bears the signifi
cant title, "They Listen Not". Ma
terialism, false philosophy, national
envy and greed, unscrupulous journal
ism, ignorant hatred. Immoral litera
ture and luxury these were the fac
tors which brought on the present
tragedy of Europe, the artist contend
ed, and Doctor Ellvvood agreed with
his summing up.
Denounces "Prolil Onlj" Itttsiness.
Doctor Ellwood strongly denounces
"profit onlj" business, the unscrupu
lous, cut-throat competition among in
dividuals. He attacked the lust for
power in the hearts of men and na
tions, which, he said, was a potent
cause of the war.
"To get rid of war, we must get rid
of the causes of war," declared Doc
tor Ellwood. "Hatred is not removed
when we remove weapons. Hatred
must be replaced by love. Let us op
pose with all our strength the recent
deplorable tendency on the part of
too many peoplc and nations to de
ify force. Let us beware of the ten
dency to live an economic life at the
expense of the spiritual."
Proposes World Police Force.
Referring to the much discussed
oroblems of preparedness and disarm
ament, the speaker expressed him
self in favor of strengthening our
piesent forces but opposed emphat
ically to any radical change. "Uni
versal service no!" he declared.
The way out, according to Doctor
Ellvvood, lies in the combination of
the armaments of all nations to act
as a police force. We must lock our
door and give no temptation to other
nations but we must not be a nation
bristling with spears. To make war
should be treated as a crime, he main
tained. Any nations attempting to
make war should be treated by the
other nations as a common enemy.
