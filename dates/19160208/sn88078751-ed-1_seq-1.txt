Berlin's Reply Affords Basis For
Amicable
Final Understanding Expected Within
Very Short lime
waanmgton, Feb. 7. Berlin's latest
memorandum on the Lusitania contro
versy can be 'made the basis of an
emlcable sottleniont, according to In
formation which came from a high
ndmlnlstratltin source. Whether the
final agreement can take the exact
form of the Berlin memorandum re
mains to be determined at a confer
ence which the president and Secic
tary Lansing are expected to hold.
At all ovents the communication
which Ambassador Bernstorit handed
to the srcietary last Friday has Im
proved tlie outlook. This information,
coming from an unquestionable
source, conllrmo an impression which
has steadily grown in the last twenty
four hours that all prospect of a rup
ture in the relations between the two
govormncyiU. has been removed for
the present.
So optimistic are certain officials
that thoy expect an announcement
from the White House or the Btate
dopartmput within the next two or
three ''ays which will remove all ap
prehension as to a break. It is un
derstood that tho president and Sec
rotary Lansing- will have met and
have marto up their minds definitely
fcoforo tho cabinet meets tomorrow
Tho only point now at issue rests
on the acceptability of eight words
used by tlia Berlin foreign office to
avoid the expression ''illegal." This
United States wanted Germany to say
that sho would pay Indemnity because
tho attack on the Lusltahia resulting
in the killing of 115 Americans was il
legal. Germany has offered, instead,
to Bay that she will pay indemnity
feecause, inasmuch as Americans were
on the vessel, the attack should not
have been made.
In German oircles it was said that
tmt for tho interview given out in Ber
lin by Undersecretary ot Foreign Af
faire Zimmerman, calling attention to
Uto refusal of Gormany to employ the
vrord "Illegal," the Amorlcan public
might nover have noted tho omlSBlon,
so close does tho expression actually
used correspond with "Illegal."
Count Von Bernstorff, according to
his friends, is more than ever confi
dent that Germany's proposals ore go
ing to bo accepted by tho United
States. Anticipating that the Ameri
can government would accopt t'no
final prorosalB of Berlin in their en
tirety, it is stated that tho ambassa

Burton's Managers On Good Working

and Expect Second Choice Suppor
Knox Likely to Enter Race at an
Early Date Indiana to Declare For
Ex-Senator Fairbanks.
Washington, Feb. 7. Within a
month the first primary election will
be held to select delegates for the Re
publican national convention. Thi3
will be In Indiana. Interest in it is
passive, because the state has a favor
ite son, Charles W. Fairbanks, who
will have the support of his state
without opposition from other candi
dates. Immediately following tho In
diana primaries will come the New
Hampshire and Minnesota events.
New Hampshire is expected to elect
delegates who will support Senator
Weeks and Minnesota will choose del
egates instructed for Senator Cum
mins. Th8 North Dakota primaries will
also he held early, and it is the belief
here that sluce Senator Cummins has
given away to LaFolIette there, that
the senator from Wisconsin will car
ry that state, as he carried it four
years ago over both Taft and Roose
velt. Thus the early March primaries
will put four candidates for the Re
publican nomination in the field prao
tlcally without opposition.
Never before In the history of poli
tics, say theold-line politicians, has so
little definite information been obtain
sble as to the trend of politics within
five months of a convention. Every-
tody in the Republican camp seem
satisfied and hopeful. A lot of politi
cians wink knowingly and say the
outlook is just what is desired.
It is very certain that there will he
no Republican choice before the con
vention meets. The presidential pri
mary, which was expected to resuit
in the people making a choice in ad
vance of the convention and the dele
gates simply to record the popular
will, has operated just the other way
A lot of favorite sons are obtaining
tho endorsement ot their respective
states without a struggle.
Senator Burton's campaign man
agers are very hopeful. They appear
to b content to allow favorite sons
in other states to be complimented
and claim that they are on good word
ing terms with all other candidate
and logical heirs of second choice sup
port. Senator Burton has been speak
ing almost steadily for several week..
One of the most iiitcresting rumor
of the week Is that Senator P. C.
Knox will he found to be In the race
soon and strongly backed. His can
didacy for the senate will in no wIjms
interfere with the plan to make him
a presidential candidate, it was said.
