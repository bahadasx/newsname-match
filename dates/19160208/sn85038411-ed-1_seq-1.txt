LUSITANIA CASE
IS DESCRIBED AS
"VERY HOPEFUL"
Announced After Cabinet
Meeting That Reply Is
Almost Acceptable
CONCLUSION IS NEAR
High Officials Say Countries
Are Substantially in Accord;
Crisis Passed
Washington. Feb. 8. Tliat
the l.usitanin case looks "very
hopeful" was the statement made
by a high administration official
following the conference between
President Wilson and Secretary
1 rinsing. It was indicated that
Ibe President considers Ger
many's latest offer as almost, if
not entirely, a«-ceptable.
Secretary I-ansing and the Presi
dent conferred until a few minutes
before the cabinet meeting in the
seclusion of the President's study in
the White House.
Secretary Lansing went to the
White House an hour before ihe
cabinet meeting to discuss the Lusi
tania negotiations with President
Wilson. Mr. Lansing said an an
nouncement on the acceptibility of
Germany's latest proposals was im
probable to-day and he could not say
whether he would later confer with
Count Von Rernstorff.
Tt was understood, however, that a
conference between the Ambassador
and the Secretary later in the day
was probable.
Under the surface there were inti
mations that some further corre
spondence may be under way while
President Wilson and Secretary Lans
ing consider Germany's latest pro
posal. It has not been disclosed
whether it may be with the American
embassy in Berlin or with Colonel E.
M. House the President's persona!
representative, who was recently in
Berlin where he discussed the situ
ation with German officials. Secretary
Lansing's announcement when Ger
many's answer was received, that it
V would be four or five days before a
decision was reached, is being recalled
by those who believe further corre
spondence is in progress.
The statement that a mere question
of words, would not be permitted to
block a settlement of the case at this
stage, which came from the highest
authority, has thrown an atmosphere
of optimism about the situation which
continues to lead officials in close
■touch with the negotiations to believe
that a successful termination of the
case Is close at band.
t.ate to-day Secretary Tensing will
confer with Count von Bernstorff. the
German ambassador. It is expected
he will communicate to the ambas
sador the American government's view
of the latest proposal from Berlin
which substituted for the word "illegal"
in the reference to the sinking of the
Lusitania a declaration that reprisals
must not be extended to others than
enemy subjects.
Practically Satisfactory
with the assurances Germany pre
offieials, while all of them steadfastly
refrain from making any definite an
nouncement. is that this declaration,
wtili the assurances Germany pre
viously had given and with the other
features of the Lusitania agreement
already agreed upon, is practically sat
isfactory, and that if any further
changes are necessary, the way is
open for them without endangering
'he success of the negotiations. Some
formal announcement indicating a sat
isfactory conclusion of the long con
troversy is expected soon.
One administration official indicated
nfter the Cabinet meeting that it would
not be necessary for the United States
to make any further suggestions to
Germany.
Later high administration officials
authorized the statement that "the
United States and Germany are sub
stantially in accord."

Max Harden and Lord North

of Situation
Special to the Telegraph
Xew York. Feb. B.—That neither
Germany nor England is looking to
ward an early peace is indicated by
dispatches reaching here from London
and Berlin. In the German capital
Max Harden, editor of Die Zukunft.
declared before a large audience that
Germany is well able to fight long and
persistently and that her resources
have not as yet been touched, while
in London Lord Northcliffe is quoted
as telling an audience of Englishmen
that the "war will be very long." and
in the end may have to be fought out
by Germany and England, although.
France, he said, felt the same way
about it. These utterances may veil
some sort of crisis in the European
situation, some critics believe.
Harden said that the delusion pre
vailed that Germany for years had
prepared for war and that the entente
powers, therefore, had only to wait

BIG GERMAN AND
ALLIED GUNS IN
TERRIFIC DUEL
Entire Franco-Belgian Front
Is Active; Russ and Teu

TURKS ARE DRIVEN BACK
Being Pressed Westward;
Kitchener to Be Sent to
Egypt, Is Report
Except for the continuation of the
intensive bombardment along the
Franco-Belgian front, there are few
reports of aotivity from the major
fields of military operations. Whether
the notable play of the German.
French and British guns on hostile
positions is preparatory to important
infantry operations or is for minor
purposes is not apparent.
The current of official statements
a-s well us independent reports indi
cate th*- continuation of a state of
quietude along the broad front where
Russians and Teutons have been fac
ing each other for months past with
few changes of territory.
Only in the Caucasus, apparently,
are the Russian armies active. The
Petrograd war office reports continued
advances there against the Turks, both
north and south of Erzcum, the ttfts
sian forces having pressed further
westward along the black sea coast
and along the northern shores of Bake
Van.
To Transfer Kitchener
Reports were current in London that
Field Marshal Karl Kitchener is to
take over the command of the British
forces in Egypt and that the Earl of
Derby, who has been in charge of re
cruiting, is to be the new secretary of
state lor war. These reports are un
confirmed.
General Pojivanoff, Russian minis
ter of war. is quoted to-day as de
claring that the Russian munitions
crisis is now a thing of the past and
that the system of handling recruits
is such that the units of the Russian
army can now lie kept up to their full
strength with fully trained men.
The French have been making ef
forts to regain territory they lost some
ten days ago south, of the river
Somme, but according to Berlin they
were unsuccessful, their attacks which
were preceded by intensive artillery
preparation, being repulsed.
The airmen on this front again have
been active, a squadron of German
aeroplanes attacking British camps in
Belgium.
Petrograd has information that'
there have been recent transfers of
large bodies of German troops to the
west front, which is held there to in
dicate that the Germans are preparing
again to devote the greater part of
their strength to the war areas in:
l'*rance in Belgium.
S3BO Lost Eleven Years Ago
in Safe Is Now Claimed
Indianapolis, Ind.. Feb. B. The S3BO
found in Chicago in a safe that for
merly had been used in the revenue
offices here has a claimant, according
to an announcement made here to-day.
About eleven years ago Edward
Elliott, who now lives in Idaho, was a
revenue clerk in the local office. I.e
was charged with a shortage of S3BO
and. although it was believed the,
shortage was due to a clerical error, !
Elliott had to pay the government
S3BO. Soon after this the safe in the
revenue office was outgrown and a
new one took its place. The old safe
was sent to Chicago and placed in !
storage.
Bast summer one of the government
offices in Decatur, 111., was in need of j
a safe and it was decided to take the |
old strong box that had seen service In 1
Indianapolis from storage and place It
back In active service in Decatur. In i
cleaning out the safe a paper was j
pulled from under the lining and by
further search the S3BO, in bills, were!
taken from the hiding place.
The finding of the money was given |
wide publicity and reached Mr. Elliott 1
out in Idaho. Mr. Elliott's claim was ,
filed at Washington by Frank Smith, ;
of this city, who was chief clerk in the
revenue office when Elliott was
charged with the shortage.
