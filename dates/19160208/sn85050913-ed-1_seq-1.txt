AGE.
Gun Had Probably Been Discharged
When Young Man Slipped
/•''V ',g andFeUi
A//::*
The community was shocked and
horrified Saturday afternoon about
three o'clock to hear that Alve M.
Wright, a young, unmarried man
twenty-five years of age who has
made his -home with hia brother,
John Wright, for tfye past five years,
had met his death in a shooting ac
cident on the farm operated by the
latter—the former F. A. Edwards
I'ji farpi, just southeast of the city.
The young man had left the barn
yard to hunt and set traps about ten
o'clock in the forenoon and the fam
ily becoming anxious after dinner,
began a search for him finding his
I lifeless body about two o'clock in the
afternoon, within calling distance of
the barn, stretched out on the icy
hillside, a gun shot through hisj
head. The body Was lying about
twenty-five feet down the side of the
hill just below the barn lot a little
northwest of the north barn.
.Indications were that the unfort
unate young man had, upon leaving
the barnyard, made his way down
the hill which is very steep, to a
point w&ere.haJiad. evidently chang
ed his course and1 started to climb up
,t the hill again to cross over a point
ofland just. Outside of the barn
fence. Track* In the snow showed
that he had been within about twen
ty feet of the top when he began to
slip and_, as he slipped, he threw his
head a little to the left. He had
carried the qhot gun in his left hand
^ana the shells showed that as he
jijslid, he must have struck the stock
Jpof the gun a severe blow on the ice
vf| for one of the shells was exploded—
the shot entering the head just in
Hie front of the left ear so close to the
If head that powder burns were visi-
The victim df the accident must
have, died a painless death and
doubtless never had a moment of
consciousness.
About 1:30 o'clock, Mrs. John
Wright became anxious over the
nonappearance of her brother-in-law
'and asked that search be made for
him. George Beem, who is employed
upon the f^rm, remembered the di
rection*, taken by young Wright and
soon found his tracks leading oat of
.the /barn yard. Following them to
'the top of the hill, the ghastly dis
'covery of the {body was made. The
i. coroner was at op$ sent for, and
the hillside Incline was so perilous
,that dfBcent wasj only possible by
"means if a'rope aj-pund the "body of
the coroner, Arch Foster, who found
Ithat life had been extinct in the
Ibody for hours.. The hands, feet and
%ead of young Wright were badly
frozen and the accident must have
-occurred very soon after he left the
barnyard, although theAgun shot
was not heard at the farm.
The' body was brought to this city
where a.n inquest was held in the
evening at the Foster undertaking
rooms, with P. J. Brandrup, J. N.
Omstead and John DeWitt as cor
oner's Jury. The verdict was one of
accidental death caused by the dis
charge of the victim's gun while
Stunting.
The remains were taken to De
Taw, Ind., Sunday afternoon, where
"the parents of the young man reside,
and were accompanied by a brother,
John Wright, and little daughter
and by a half-brother, Wash Wright,
both of whom reside in the vicinity.
Alve Wright was the youngest son
of the family, was a young man of
regular and steady habits and his
brothers are crushed by the sad man
ner of hia death. He had lived in
this jfkini^y _about five years, and
'had planned to work a farm near
Williams during the jcoming year,
with Carl Daniels of this city. The
young men had their fanning imple
ments and stock all bought and ex
pected to go upon the farm March
1st.
Mrs. A. C. Clark, who has been
very ill with grippe at the home of
her son, R. G. Clark, Is now able to
sit up some in bed each day.
A VERY UNIQUE
The service at the Baptist church
Sunday night was something of a
novelty. Mr. and Mrs. George Steep
in their work vith the Baptist Jun
ior Union have organized two bands
of youthful workers, known as the
"Boys Gospel Tea'm" and, the "Girls
Gospel Team." The boy's team had
been invited to take charge of the
evening church services and the
leader, Howard Parkhurst, promptly
at 7:30, came forward with a care
fully prepared program. The mem
bers of tlie team were seated on the
platform, in' chairs arranged in a
semi-circle, with their leader in the
center /The pastor occupied a seat
in the audience, and the boys were
left in charge. The, exercises open
ed "with a song service, dtiring which
the leader called upon the pastor
and other men to offer prayers. He
gave the usual weekly announce
ments, and did not forget the collec
tion.. The Scripture reading by
Howard Parkhurst, the deader, was
followed by recitations, by Harold
Cunningham and Geofge Steep Jr.
and solos by Glen Steep and James
White. Each boy entered into his
part in the program with such dig
nity aijd serious attention to-his du
ty, that if any came to the service
with the notion^ that it would be
frivolous, or merely entertaining,
they were disappointed. After a
closing object lesson by the pastor,
assisted by Ralph Mikel, Mr. George
Steep came forward and stood beside
the pastor, joining him in commend
ing Christ to the young people, and
two responded to the invitation to
make a public confession of a desire
to be His disciples.
Children's Dancing Class.
Miss Jean Lewis, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Sam T. Lewis, has almost
completed arrangements for a chil
dren's class in dancing which will
hold its first meeting in Willson's
hall soon. Miss Lewis will instruct
children of two classes—jounger
and older—in the etiquette of the
dance, teaching many, of the older
dances, including Virginia Reel, the
German, etc., besides a 'few of the
more modern steps, excluding the
freak dances of late years so much
in vogue. '1
Undergoes Operation.
Ed McFarlane, who has been ill
for about two weeks with grippe and
other complications, wa? compelled
to uhdergo a serious operation this
morning at his home on west Wal
nut street. Ho is getting along as
well as could bq expected.
Fractured Bib.
Thomas Pringle, who resides on a
farm seven miles northeast of the
city, fell on the ice Saturday a. m.
while doing his chores about the
barn and fractured a rib. A physic
ian was called and the patient is
now resting easily.
Mrs. Charles E. Hoffman, who has
been critically ill since an operation
performed Doc. 31^t, has improved
within the past fetr days so much
that it is planned to move her to
day from the residence of Dr.
Conrad to her own home on Bank

ForlHaroh 1st.
Rev. Haywood has at last decided
the matter of the call extended by
the Universalist church of Waterloo
and has made known his intentions
without waiting for a formal accept
ance of his resignation by the church
in this city. The resignation was
given about ten days ago and the
parish is reluctant to accept the
same, although realizing keenly
Rev. Haywood's position regarding a
larger field for work.
At the parish meet held to
night, the resignation will be ac
cepted and Rev. Haywood will leave
for Waterloo Wednesday to find a
home for the family. He will not go
to the new home to remain until

TJERNAGLE FAMILY
Will Give Concert in the Congrega
tional Church on the Evening
of Feb. 22.
The well known Tjernagle family
orchestra, the members of which are
residents of Scott township, residing
in the vicinity of {landall, will give
concert in this city, Tuesday even
ing, Ffeb. 22, at the Congregational
church. The family constitutes an
orchestra of no mean ability and
consists of the following: T. G.
Tjernagle and brothers, M. O. and
N. Tjernagle, the former a 'cellist
and the two latter clarinet players:
the rest .of the orchestra consists of
G. Tjernagle's family ranging
from- six years to eighteen years—
one girl, a pianist, and four boys
who play first, and second violins
and violas—a total of eight instru
mentalists.
While the details have not yet
been settled, it is probable that this
concert will be given under the aus
pices of the chorus choir of the Con
gregational church. It is further
likely that no admission fee will be
charged for the entertainment, but
silver offering taken,/and the ev
ening given over to the enjoyment
of music.

Representative of Bedp&th-Vawter
Bureau in City for Next Win
ter's Course.
A representative of- the Redpath
Vawter lyceum bureau of Cedar
Rapids was here Saturday interview
ing the churches and organizations
in regard to a winter's lecture course
in this city. Since the Cook musical
course there has not been a winter's
course of lectures .or concerts in
Webster City and "movies" and
home entertainments have furnished
the attractions other than plays.
There are those who would like to
see in this 'city another winter, a
good lecture course, such as was
ouce furnished Webster City people
twelvei and fifteen years ago. Such
a course would serve two purposes
to amuse and instruct the public
—and with proper management,
might make a neat profit for some
worthy cause. A thought has been
advanced that the women's clubs of
this city with a united effort, might
take over the plan of a really fine
lecture course, composed of the cream
of Chautauqua talent and have a five
number course, the proceeds to go
for the benefit of the Community
House fund. This fund was started
by the Choral society of this city
who plan to add to the fund witli
their next public cantata.
Something will have to be done
within the next few years toward
this project if a sufficient sum is to
be raised to secure the Estes' bequest
and the lecture course plan looks
like a good one, at the same time
furnishing instruction and recrea
tion for the winter months.

It is only about a month until the
school election and it Is time the
people were beginning to think
whom they want for director. ,The
term of Geo. S. Lane expires this
spring. Mr. Lane has served on the
board the past nine years, has given
general satisfaction and would no
doubt be re-elected If he would con
sent to serve longer. But the Free
man-Tribune is informed that he
will not accept the position again,
feeling that he h»s done his share.
There are plenty of good men for
the place and the people ought to
consider the matter and decide upon
Whom they want to succeed Mr.
Lane.
JUNK FIRMS TO BID
0)1 CRJQOKED CREEK
It is Expected That the Bondholders
Will Also Bid on the
Property.
Fort Dodge Messenger: Three or
four Junk firms will bid at the fore
closure sale of the Crooked Creek
Railroad and Coal Company. This
information has been received by an
attorney for Sam McClure, receiver
for the road. If one of these firms
securep the line, the "track undoubt
edly will be torn up 'and sold for
junk.
Judge H, T. Reed of Cresco, judge
of the federal court, has ordered a
decree for a foreclosure sale. As
soon as he receives it, a date for the
sale will be fixed. All iclaims against
the road must be filed by Feb. 29, to
be valid.
The bondholders also will enter a
bid for the road if information re
ceived Is correct. The First Trust
Company of Milwaukee, mortgage of
the road, will probably enter the bid.
for the bondholders.
The eighteen mile stretch of light
weight track was built in 1882 when
the coal industry^ was thriving in Le
high. The road runs over a route
from Lehigh to Webster City, a dis
tance of eighteen miles. A qioneer
of Webster City named W. C. Will
son was the prime mover fn building
the railroad.
A story is told of Willson tjfaat will
bear retelling. He visited the offices
of a transcontinental road while in
the east and offered to exchange
transportation.
"Why my road crosses the conti
nent,' said the trunk line's presi
dent, "while yours is only eighteen
miles long."
"My road may not be as long as
yours," rejoined Mr. Willson,"but it
1s just as wide."
Mr. Willson received an exchange
of transportation.
The venerable locomotive is indis
posed and what might be termed ar
tificial stimulants must be adminis
tered to keep it going through the
usual routine of a round trip a day
to Webster City and return. As a
result, Mr. McClure has asked for
an order permitting him to rent an
other enginp. Judge Reed has inti
mated the order will be signed'as
soon as it is presented to him.
TALK OF FORMING
BASE BALL LEAGUE
Suggestion That an Eight Town Or
ganization be Effected
This Year.
Jewell Record: Here is a sugges
tion that we have heard mentioned
liy baseball enthusiasts recently in
regard to organizing a baseball
league for next summer.
The suggestion is to organize an
eight *town league, composed of Wil
liams, Stanhope, Jewell, Ellsworth,
Radcliffe, Story City, Roland and
McCallsburg. Play 28 game sched
ules, each club playing each of the
other seven clubs four games, two at
home and two abroad. Start the
schedule about May 1st, scheduling
two games a week for each team
May, June, July, and the first week
of August would complete the sched
ule, leaving about four more weeks
before the various players who go
away to school in September would,
have to leave.' These four weeks
should suffice for playing off post
poned and tied games. Teams that
have players in schools would be
weakened in. May before the men re
turn home in the spring, but it
would be better for them to be weak
in the first month of the season than
in the last month. Two suggestions
made from the experience of the
1915 Hamilton county baseball
league a that at the opening of the
season arrangements be made in re
gard to umpiring for the season, and
that at the beginning of the season
each club file as many names of
players as each wishes to, but that
^teams be confined to the use of play
ers throughout the entire season
whose names are included in the
lists filed before the season opens.

Farm Sale.
In spite of the bad weather and
the poor corn crop last year, some
farm sales are taking place. A. M.
Hicks of Colfax, 111., was in the city
the latter part of the week and in
company with P. W. Lee went up in
to Wright county to look at a 240
acre farm. The ground was covered
with snow an£ ice, but Mr. Hicks
thought he knew a bargain when he
saw it, hence he purchased the farm.
It is only a mile and a half from.
Gait. He bought it of G. W. Finn
at $165 per acre. Mr. Hicks has
owned a number of farms in Hamil
ton county and now owns the old F.
M. Willa'rd place in Cass township,
and some others.
Arthur Hawkes, who resides on
