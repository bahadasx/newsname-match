Slight Difference Regarding
Wording is Expected To
Be Easily Adjusted.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 8. High ad
ministration officials, following the
cabinet meeting today authorized the
statement that "the United States and
Germany are substantially in accord."
6rmany's latest reply in the Lusi
tanla negotiations was characterized as
almost, if not, entirely, acceptable to the
I'nlted States by high officials today
after secretary Lansing had conferred
with president Wilson more than an
hour, and the case had been discussed,
at the cabinet meeting. Tbe whole
situation was described by administra
tion officials as "very hopeful."
Liater today, secretary Lansing con
ferred with count von Bernstorff. the
German ambassador. He communicat
ed te the ambassador the American
gtratnent'a vjw at the latest pro
posal from Berlin which Substituted for
the word "illegal" in the reference to
the sinking of the Lusltanla a declara
tion that reprisals must not be extend
ed to others than enemy subjects.
Slight Difference About Wording.
Another high administration official
said that the case could not be consid
ered finally settled, but that it was
hoped a settlement might be reached
durii g the conference between secre
tary Lansing and the German ambas
sador, although that was not absolutely
certain. It was understood that the
exact wording of the communication
submitted by count vnn Bernstorff was
not in entire accord with the views of
the president and the cabinet.
Will Draft An Agreement.
With the two governments substan
tially in accord, the next, step in the
proceedings will be to put the settle
ments when finally agreed upon in a
formal document to bo presented to the
state department in behalf of the
Beilin foreign office.
In addition to the declaration that
the reprisals must not be directed
agrinst others than enemies, the prom
ise of indemnity for American lives lost
on the Lusitania. and a declaration of
Germany's desire to cooperate with the
United States to secure the freedom of
the seas. It is understood that the docu
ment will either incorporate or atten
tion will be directed to the assurances
Germany gave in the Arabic case that
liners would not be hunk without
warning, provision being made for the
safety of those on board, unless they
resisted capture or attempted to flee.
The inclusion of all these points is
understood to 'embrace everything for
which' the United States has contended.
No Fnrther Conceptions deeded.
A high administration official said
late today:
"The wording prepared by Germany
appears to cover the position or the
I'nited States. It Is not fair to assume
that there will have to be any further
admissions or concessions from Ber
lin." KITCHENER If

The United States has asked

H
for the Villa, government while
it existed, has been indicted by
the El Paso county grand jury on a
charge of having sent Mexicans from
Juarez to pull spikes fronpthe G. II A
S. A. main lino near Fort Hancock, Tex .
In order to wreck tbe Carranza troop
tralqs en route to relieve Agua Trleta
when it was being assaulted by Villa's
forces.
In Jail at Havana,
llipolito Villa Is now under aneat in
Havana, Cuba, where he went n Jan
uary 15, after fleeing Mexico, being
arrested in San Antonio on a chaige
of bringing stolen property irito the
state, brought to EI Paso and released
from custody on bond. He ts now in
jail in Havana awaiting extradition
proceedings before being Drought back
to El Paso. His arrest was at the re
quest of William E. Gonzales, U. S. min
ister to Cuba and was requested bv the
El Paso county officials. i
SajK Is a Hostage.
When arrested in Havana Villa de
nied that he had any connection with
the destruction of any railroad in tho
United States, declaring that his ar
rest was due to a belief, on the part of
the American government that, by hold
ing him as a prisoner, his brother
Francisco Villa, would be restrained
from the murder of Americans in Mex
ico. He declared that this was a mis
taken belief as his brother Francisco
did not care whether or not he was
alive or dead.
Indicted Monday.
The indictment against Hipolito Vil
la was returned by the Kramj jury Mon
day afternoon. According to W. XV.
Bridgers, district attorney, the Indict
ment charges Villa with "sending Mex
icans across the river and removing
spikes from trie rails of the G. 11. main
line below Fort Hancock at the time
the Carranza troops were moving from
Laredo and Eagle Pass to Douglas and
Agua Prieta to reinforce the Carranza
garrison which was fighting Villa at
that time."
Mexican IVns Shot.
At the time these troops were moving
through El Paso, it was reported that a
number of Mexicans bad been seen near
a bridge in the vicinity of Fort Han
cock and, when U. S. soldiers started
to Investigate, they fled toward the
international line. One was thought
to have been hit when the soldiers
fired on the Mexicans. This, coupled
with the demonstration which occurred
on the Mexican side opposite the union
station when tbe Carranza troops left
the station for the west, caused much
alarm in EI Paso for fear the Carranza
troops would be attacked by Villa
troops from Juarez while the trains
were entering or leaving El Paso. The
railroad tracks were carefully In
spected for dynamite charges, no trains
would be run at night to carry troops
and every possible precaution taken to
prevent the wrecking of the railroad
lino by .Villa soldiers or sympathizers.
Have Men ns Witnesses.
The state claims to have secured a
number of witnesses against Villa from
among men alleged to have been sent
to the American side by him. These,
district attorney Bridgers, declares, will
b used at the trial of Villa when he
is returned here.
Sheriff P. J. Edwards stated Tuesday
morning that he was awaiting the nec
essary papers before going after Villa
and he has been expecting the Mexi
can's arrest in Havana for two weeks.
Villas In Court.

have been in the courts in EI Jjso and

While the naval reserve law has been

Blue replied that no navy was kept

"How much time would we be likely
to have to mobilize if we were at
tacked?" asked Mr. Britten.
That would be an important thing
to know," said tbe admiral.
"Do you know," asked- Mr. Britten,
"that rear admiral Fisk testified last

Admiral Blue replied that "the fleet
could undertake anything in the Pa

Senate Ha Own Threat.
"Tho threat of the armor barons to
hold up the government will not affect
congress," said senator Tillman. "W
weie given to understand that the
armor manufacturers would increase
their price because government manu
facture of armor plate would force
them to go out -of that business and
they would charge this enormous In
crease in order' to provide themselves
with an amortization fund. But I guess
wo can find a way to stop the robbers.
In time of trouble we could seize their
plants and operate them, by right of
eminent domain."
Senators Compute Cost.
Senators figured that if the armor
plate manufacturers did "not raise the
price It would cost the government
$24,000,000 extra for armor plate to
complete the five year naval building
program. Senator Tillman said he
proposed to ask- senator Penrose to
