HOMELESS BY
HIGH WATER
Score of Southeastern Arkan
sas Towns Engulfed by
Fierce Flood.
16 LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST
Muddy Waters of Mississippi
Pouring Through Many
Breaks in Levees.
Little Rock, Ark., Feb. 7. The
rapidly widening lake in southeastern
Arkansas, formed by the flood waters
of the Arkansas river pouring through
breaks in the levees, has engulfed a
score of towns, leaving several thous
and persons homeless. Sixteen lives
have been lost in the floods and the
damage approximately will- run into
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Still greater damage is feared if the
Mississippi continues to rise as in the
last few days. Predicted stages at
Arkansas City would endanger the
levees there and a break in the Missis
sippi levees would precipitate a ser
ious situation in the river valley. All
day Sunday the 700 men who remain
in Arkansas City toiled to strengthen
the levees against the fast rising wa
ter, and they were hopeful that the
levees would hold and the town be
saved. The narrow strip of levee is
the only land in sight there. On one
side is the river "swollen until its sur
face is fifteen feet above the level of
the town. On the other side of the
levee is the great flood lake nearly
forty miles long and twenty miles
wide. From it only the upper stories
of buildings in Arkansas City pro
trude. At the levee are three steam
boats ready to carry the workers fo
safety should they lose their battle
with the flood. They are living in
the second stories of their homes and
in box cars on the levee.
Sunday the river rose two-tenths of
a foot, to 55.7 feet at Arkansas City,
and is still rising slowly. Above
Cairo the Mississippi and Ohio are
both falling.

GOODRIGFmMJNROjABlL
The B. F. Goodrich Co., maker of
tires, has prepared a so-called auto
mobile map of Kentucky and Tennes
see highways that needs many changes
to make it even approximately cor
rect. The Dixie Bee Line is shown
as a trunk-lino from Henderson to
Madisonville, where there is as yet
an impassable mud road and the road
from Madisonville to Hopkinsville,
piked half the distance, appears as a
mere tributary line. From Hopkins
villo via Guthrie to Adams, Tenn.,
piked all the way, there is no road at
all and no road is shown from Hop
kinsville to Princeton, 16 miles of the
way a now stato pike, nor from
Princeton to Paducah, a direct line.
The Jefferson Davis Highway east of
Hopkinsville is not considered a trunk
line. In fact, Hopkinsvillo is not giv
en anything like a sciuaro deal. Al
though it is the greatest tumpiko
center in Western Kentucky with
eight roads running to the county line
in as many directions, only two of
thesethose to Clarksvillo and Cadiz
appear as automobile routes.

Tables.
MORGAN ALSO IS POPULAR
A. M. Casey Sends More Items
About The Lexington
Meeting.
The farmers' meeting at Lexington
continues to be a great success,
writes Agent A. M. Casey.
B. Gordon Nelson conducted the
meeting Friday afternoon for the
Pig Clubs.
The spirit of co-operation is grow
ing in the state, as evidenced by
talks made by county agents.
Mr. Hill, in charge of corn clubs of
the South, Mr. Miller in the educa
tional department of the States Re
lation service and Jesse M. Jones,
field agent of the farm demonstration
work, were present.
Mr. Miller advocates more agricul
ture and other practical work in the
schools. He says a boy when he
leaves the graded schools should
have been so instructed that he has
some practical knowledge that fits
him for the business of life, whether
that be agriculture, or some of the
trades, in other words he should have
a training for practical life work.
One other county (Pulaski) has
adopted one breed of chickens,

and tact, and continues to grow big
ger and bigger and gain in poopulari-
ty.
Nelson made a hit with his meeting
Friday afternoon.
THE LEAP YEAR'S
BACKWARD BRIDES
More Than A Month Passed
And Nothing Doing
Yet.
County Judge Knight's ofFcr to
perform the marriage ceremony free
for the first bride who proposes un
der the leap year privilege and se
cures a husband, is more than dupli
cated by Esq. Baskette, of Nashville,
who offers to perform all such mar
riages free of charge. Carrying out
Judge Knight's idea, County Clerk
Harris offers to donate the license
and a number of business men have
! agreed to give articles in their re
I spective lines to help set the couple
up to house-keeping.
II TO"
J They will have to hand it to Presi
i dent Wilson as the master politician.
Close political observers of the Mid
' dlo West say that he has out-gener-'
aled both Roosevelt and Bryan and
cinched his election.
Harvey II. Ingham, editor of the
Dcs Moines Register, Republican,
takes off his hat to Wilson:
"When Bryan comes along talking
for peace at any price, the Wilson
people in Iowa can say that the presi
dent is just as much for peace as
Bryan and has shown it in keeping
the country out of war.
I "When Mr. Roosevelt comes along
shouting for war at once, the Wilson
people hero can explain that tho presi
dent Is for protecting the honor of
tho nation at any cost, and tliat is why
he came out here to ask ifio country
to prcixirc for possiblo conflict,
though making his plea dignified,
frank and straightforward.
"Tho presidont showed himself a
big American and Iowa showed its
hospitality, but Iowa is not alarmed
ovor tho dangor of war and is not go
ing to bo swept off its feet on the
militarism issue." v
Terro Hauto State Normal school

TWO NEW
COMMISSIONERS
Holland and McReynoIds De
cline to Serve and Suc
cessors Elected.
EAST AND WEST REPRESENTED
J. P. Myers and Ben F. Wood
Appointed and Selections
Approved.
R. II. Holland and Tlios. J. Mc
ReynoIds, named as the city's two
representatives on the commission of
eight to handle the funds of the bond
issue, declined to serve yesterday, in
order to afford an opportunity to give
representation to the two sections of
the county left without a representa
tive.
The Fiscal Court met yesterday and
ratified the selection of two new men
to take their places. These were Ben
F. Wood of Sinking Fork, and J. P.
Myers,-who lives on the Fairview
pike. The bi-partisan division of the
commission is still maintained, the
two new men being divided political
ly. Hopkinsville has surrendered her
representation in the interest of har
mony and it is hoped that all sections
of the county will now be satisfied and
that the vote will be overwhelmingly
for the bonds.
BILL DRAWN BY
GOVERNOR STANLEY
Kentucky Senate Passes Anti
Trust Measure Exempts
Tobacco Pools.
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 7. The sen
ate has passed the Stricklett-Pickett
anti-pass bill as amended by the house.
As soon as the bill has been enrolled
it will be submitted to the governor
for his approval.
The anti-trust bill of Senator Glenn
was a special order in the senate.
Senator Glenn explained that the
measure was drawn by Gov. Stanley.
Senator Overstreet asked if there was
anything in the measure to prevent
the farmers from pooling their tobac
co. Senator Glenn said that under
the provisions of the bill the farmers
would have more right to pool their
tobacco than they now enjoy. He said
he thought the bill went just as far as
it could, under the constitution, to
protect the farmers in their organiza
tions.
Senator Zimmerman said that if
President Wilson and Gov. Stanley
were to come into the senate and ask
him to support the bill he would not
do so if he thought it would interfere
with the farmers and the labor organ
izations. The measure was adopted.
In the house the Kaufman anti
trust measure was put through. This
bill prohibits participation in a pool,
trust agreement or combination, con
federation or understanding where
such organization is incorporated with
capital stock, cither to control the
production or sale of any commodity
or to attempt to control prices. The
measure also prohibits boycotting and
provides a heavy penalty for viola
tions. White's bill prohibiting trespassing
on land to dig ginseng or other roots
was reported favorably by the Com-
inittco on Agriculture of the house.
