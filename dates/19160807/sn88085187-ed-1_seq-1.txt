SHOULD STATE HAVE
SENT THIS MAN BACK
TO OREGON PRISON?
SPOKANE, Auk. "• —■. *. Clark, 24, has been a model cili
/«■_! of Spokane for four years.
Now he Is back in the Oregon penitentiary to pay for a four
j«'in-..111 crime.
HE IS 24 years old. He has a wife of 2i, and a three-year
old baby girl.
HIS WIFE SAYS SHE COMMITTED THE CRIME AND
THAT HE TOOK THE HLAME TO SHIELD HER!
For four years Clarke, who has lived here under the name
of Melvin Rinehart, nas been a good citizen. He has worked
faithfully as engineer ln a hotel. He hns gone home at night.
He has been a loving husband, providing for his wife as well
as his Income would allow. He has been as fine a father a B a
baby could wish to have.
But now the law has found him. And the law is clamoring for
revenge.
Let us see if the law Is entitled to the revenge it seeks.
Listen to the young couple's story and then Judge for your
self.
Five years ago they were married.
She, with her sunny hair and blue eyes, wasuiretty. And he
loved her.
He with his clean-cut face, his husky figure, and his frank,
clear eyes, was a fine specimen of man. And she loved him.
Sheriff Trails Them North
They went to New Mexlro. They were ln that state when
the first whisperings of motherhood came to her. A longing to
be with her own mother when the liaby came crept over her.
She told her husband. Their funds were short. Hut loving
her as he did, he readily assented. So they started north. They
hadn't counted on the expense. Their little pile melted away.
When they reached LaUrande, Oregon, they were brought
face to face with grim reulities. THEY WERE PENNILESS.
The young girl became desperate. She felt there must lie
no time lost If she reached her mother's home before the baby
came.
After all, she wan just a glrl--a girl who never before had
been thrust on the merries of the world.
This girl erred. She deliberately STOLE.
She filled out bad checks. She went to the LaGrande
stores. She made small purchases. And proffered the checks.
They wero accepted. She returned to her husband with enough
money to take them to Seattle.
He questioned her, but she evaded him. They started north,
and then she told him. They arrived at Seattle, with an Oregon
sheriff close behind them.
Swims Columbia to This Side
Without hesitation young Clark did the manly thing. He
gave himself up. And a few days later, the heart-broken and re
morseful young wife became a mother.
Clark was sent to the penitentiary at Salem on a one-to
five-year sentence. He stayed there four months. He grew bit
ter and resentful with the Injustice of it all. He made a key—
and got himself out. He raced through the prison yard. A
guard saw him and fired. The shot went wild.
He plunged into the Columbia and swam the Washington
■lde.
For days he eluded a big posse of guards and sheriffs and
farmers and made his way north again.
He came to Spokane, and here his wife Joined him. Here
he saw his baby for the first time. He changed his name to that
of Melvin Rinehart. He found work. And here he has been
since—a good citizen.
That's the story. Now, what do you think?
Both of them for four years have been law-abiding citizens
here.
The man Is not to blame for the crime his wife committed.
And the wife —she was only a girl.
Should-Waehlngton have given him up to Oregon?
