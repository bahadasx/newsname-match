BRITISH BOYCOTT
U.S. TO PROTEST
Anti-Trust Laws Likeiy to Be
Invoked Against Steam
ship Companies.
Inte-mitli'iial News Service?:
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 Accept
ance by France of the British boy
cott list of American firms and in
dividuals confirms the belief in of
ficial circles that there is little hope
tha. the list will be withdrawn. As
a result officials still are considering
what measures this government can
take to protect its citizens who are
being discriminated against.
The remedy most favored is action
by the department of justice under
the boycott section of the ar.ti-trust
laws. This gives a weapon tb'-t can
be utilized against the steamship
companies, which are refusing to
carry exports of the boycotted firms
to the far east and to South Ameri
can countries.
It already is certain that a protest
will Le sent to France demanding
that its action be rescinded. Its list
No. 1 as made public in I'aris yes
terday, is identical with the original
list published in London on July 18.
However, it is reported that a sup
plemental list has been completed by
the French foreign oitice which will
be made public shortly.
Protest is Identical.
The French protest will be identi
cal in terms w ith that al: vady sent to
Great Britain. As a matter of Tact a
copy of that protest was sent to the
French embassy here when it was
cableel to Bondon for presentation to
the British foreign cMic- by Ambas
sador Page.
There will bo no further steps ta
ken by this government in the boy
cott case until Ambassador Tage
reaches here and confers with Fres't
Wilson. Sec'y ef State Lansinc:. and
Counsellor Folk. At this conference
all e.f t.- details of the British ac
tion will be communicated directly
by Mrll Page. Then it is expected
that another effort will be made to
get satisfaction from Kngland.
Koprwils Abandoned.
The talk of commercial reprisals
through congressional action has
about die! down. It is accepted that
a preisram of such action could not
be put throut;h under existing con
ditions and if such action finally is
determined upon as the best policy
it will go over to the short session
.f congress which convenes in De
cember. In order that the administration
can meet this situation intelligently
Pep. Nichols, of Michigan, with the
approval of the state department,
h.?s ir.troelu-.-ed a resolution authoriz
ing representatives, to gather infor
mation regarding the trade with the
allies. This resolution will author
ire the state department to compile
thru-h all its representatives in all
bellicertnt countries, details of how
goods of American origin are being
duplicates! there and te what extent
American foreign trade has been in
terfered with. This will give a ba

that may eventually be determined

In some cases the entrances and
exits were so cunningly concealed as
to be invisible. If the Germans wer
as excellent offensive lighters as they
vre clever at making" defence works,
they would b irresistible.
As a matter of fact, they are too
fond of their underground caverns
and there is reason to believe that in
ordinary trench dugouts which are
much larger than those of the
French and Pritish. thousands f
Germans have been buried alive.
One dugout I visitel had been the
home of German otficers. It con
tained comfortable beds, an excel
lent, vvell-lilled wine cellar, electric
lights, and was dug so deep that
even the explosion of a 17-inch shell
would have made very little impres
sion. Kxternally, there are no signs
whatever of existence of these forts.
All that appears above the ground
may resemble ruins of a farm house.

Oefeoses
On the whole, the appearance of
the German prisoners is quite dif
ferent from those 1 have met even
a few months ago. I.nt then we had
practically no artillery. Now we
have unlimited puns and shells and
there is nothing obi-fashioned in
our equipment.
All .New Iiuipmcnt.
Owing to the fact that we started
with nothing, everything we now
have is the latest and lie st.
The Germans count the fact that
the training of artillery etlicers in
peace time is a matter of some1 years.
Our gunners are already as accurate
as the Ger;nans. Our guns are new
er and inasmuch as they are afraid
to send up their aeroplanes and ob
servation balloons, our batteries
know what they are doing, where a.s
the Germans are tiring blindly.
It is all new and delightful and I
enjoyed every minute of my lfi days
stay with the Pritish and French
armies.

SUBWAY ORDER;
S
1
South Shore Denies Public
Need of Safer Crossing
at New Carlisle.
Reasons for setting aside or modi
fying the order for the construction
of subways on the Lincoln highway
near New Carlisle under the New
York Central Railroad Co., the Chi
cago, South Rend and Northern In
diana Railway Co. ami the Chicago,
Rake Shore and (South Rend Railway
Co.. are shown in a suit tile-d in cir
cuit court Monday morning by the
latter company against the Indiana
public service commisson. The order
to build the subway was made by the
pubic service commission on July 18
after a petition has been made by
the St. Joseph county commissioners.
In its complaint the Chicago, L.ake
Shore and South Rend Railway Co.
asks that if the subway is to be put
through that this company not be
compelled -o pay the cost to too
approach to the subway under the
New York Central right of way. The
company asks that the order be
modified "that Instead of the pla!n
tiff being required to pay the cost of
the approach to the subway under
the New Yejfk Central right of way
that should pay no part ef such
cost thereof, but only such . addi
tional cost as would be incurred if
this plaintiff were not within the
area of such separation of grades."
Cite Seven Reasons.
Seven reasons why the order
should be set aside entirely are given
by the railway company. The com
pany slates that it is impracticable
to separate the grades; that the ex
pense is out of proportion to tho
benefit; that the amount of travel
and the topography of the land sur
rounding the crossing is sjch that
the expense would not justify the
separation of the grades; that tho
north and south road which crosses
fclightly west of the Lincoln hihway
crossing would remain intact witn
out separation and the separation of
the Lincoln highway crossing would
accomplish but little; that the pro
portion of cos? would impose an un
reasonable burden on the company;
that if the separation of the grade
is ordered it can be done at a much
its, expense by putting the l-rido
abutments at right angles to the
railroads and not in line with the
present line of the highway.
Deilio Public- Nee!.
The tifth of the seven reasons
given by the company denies that
there is any public neei for the sep
aration of grades.
Kfforts have been made by the
railway companies to have the line
of the Lincoln highway charged in
order that the subways should be
built at riht angles to th- tracks.
The jire: sent order of the Commis
sion require s the steam and elee trie
lines to put their tracks dia-or.ally
across the highway. The w rk of
finishing Lincoln highway aas teen
heb! up for some- time per. din, the
action of the commission.
