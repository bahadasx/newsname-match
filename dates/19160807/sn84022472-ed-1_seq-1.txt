were under orders issued by officers of
the Amalgamated Association of Street

strige today in an effort to secure rec
ognition of that union, an increase in
wages and better working conditions.
The strike was called for 3:30 a. m.
by Harry E. Flynn, president of the
local division. Apparently there was
no change in the running schedule of
the lines of the Philadelphia Rapid
Transit Co., which operate the street
railways. Flynn issued a statement
saying 1,800 of the 4,700 employes of
the company had responded to the
strike order and that several lines were
tied up and others crippled. Strike
breakers had replaced the men out, he
said. j ' v
. Company officials asserted that only
a negligible number of men had quit
and that all lines were being operated
as usual. As a matter of 'precaution,
police were stationed at all car barns
and power houses. '
The union's leader asserted that ad
ditional men would be induced to join
the .strikers later in the day. , '
The strikers were arrested following

The lawsuit jwhich resulted when
Norman S. Gouldem, a local plumber.
claimed he was . Insulted from the
stage of the Park theatre ' by an actor
named Sam Sidman, has been settled
out of court. Gouldei sued for $2,000
but the. terms' of settlement were not
made public. The action was brought
in the common pleas court.
It was alleged . that GouMen sat in
the front row at the theatre- on the
night of March 13, 1915, when Harry
Hastings' Big Show was performing.
During the course of the performance
Sidman is said to have advanced to
the footlights' and said in part, as he
pointed to, a stage hand and looked at
GouVden, "If he was not better look

"Where did you get thp- big blonde?

Leslie-that she stopped her song and
began to cry. Meta C'ark. a chorus
girl, testified that GouMen made loud
remarks of an insulttngnature when

Undersea Boats in That
Vicinity, Capitol Says.
Machiasport, Me., Aug. 7
Captain Small, of the Cross
Island coast guari station, re
ported this morning, that his
station had sighted a large sub
marine bound west. Its na
tionality could not be determin
ed but the captain said he has
no doubt that it was an under
sea craft The submarine was
coming to the surface when it
was sighted and after running
awash 15 minutes, again sub
merged. , 1 ' '"" -it
was thought that the ves
sel might be the German sub
marine Bremen. So far as can
be learned there are no United
States' - submarines off " the
Mainei coast. -
The lookout who sighted the sub
marine later said that he picked the
vessel up In clear jweather five miles
to the southeast. As the vessel cam's
to the' surface the lookout said he
heard several blasts from the signal
at the lighthouse on1 Seal Island, a
British possession. . . .
. He bellevacUthat the keeper of the
lighthouse was signalling to the keep
er at Grand Manan Light, also British
owned, that a submarine had been
sighted. ' , -..''. ri -
Immediately after the whistle
sounded the submarine submerged. ' A
few moments later a haze set in and
it was impossible to see more, than
four miles off Cross Island.
Lowell Dunn, the lookout on Cross
Island, later reported ithat he had
sighted a second submarine consider
ably smaller than the first one. -
' Cross Island lies close to the Maine
coast. If the vessel was' the Bremen
she was either off her course or, fori
reasons best known to the master of
the merchantmen, had chosen to close
in close to the enemy's country in
order to arrive sooner within the three
mile limit, '. . -' . -
To be off Cross Island the submarine
must have skirted the coast of Nova
Scotia and rounded Sable Island;
thence heading nortn along the edge
of the Bay of -Fundy instead of taking
the mere direct route, . crossing the
Gulf of Maine to Bar Harbor or Port
land. The Indicated course would
bring her within the three mile limit

Paris, Aug. 7. Corporal Gouteaubler
of the French light Infantry haa been
decorated with , a military cross by
President Poincare for capturing 100
Germans, including . two officers, aided

rejoined his post" r

raded before President Poincare on

forward at the German' positions. . The
first wave had swept over the enemy's
trenches and the second had followed
to complete the operation. However,
from a hollow toward the right, a well
sustained fusillade was being poured
on the flank of the attackers.

"Go out' of the wood at once and
march to the rear."
