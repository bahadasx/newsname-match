THREE OTHER SPEECHES
Has Conference with Mich
igan Republicans and
' Suffragettes
. By Perry Arnold. :
(United Press stnff correspondent.)
Detroit, Mich.,. Aug. 7. Republican
Nominee Hughes' first appeal for votes
on his campaign tour for the presidency
was a plea for Americanism, expression
of a hope of a get-together spirit of co
operation between capital and labor and
indorsement of a national movement for
welfare of American workers.
The nominee spoke the first of his
campaign talks in ; a stifliugly close
room at the Hotel .Pontchartrain to a
committee representing welfare workers
of every big factory in Detroit. There
were more than a hundred persons who
crowded in and mopped their faces in
the blistering beat between handclaps
for the nominee. It was quite a dem
onstration, considering the heat and it
followed a really unusual outpouring
of the public early in the mornine to
greet the G. O. P. aspirant for presiden
tial honors as he paraded through the
streets in an automobile.
Democracy cannot stand strife be
tween capital and ilabor, Hughes told
the welfare workers.
"We are not labweieor capitalists,"
he continued. "Wt'nre all American
citizens."
The Welfare; workers were introduced
to Hughes by J. if. Eaton, of the Cadil
lac Motor company. He explained how
the big manufacturers in Detroit had or
ganized branches for free medical Atten
tion to their employes, free legal advicl
and had planned recreation places and
nourishing meals for them.
Says He Is a Laborer.
"Detroit takes .tho-lead in a great
many things, but there is nothing in
which its advance is more important
than in this welfare work," said
Hughes in responding.. "There is noth
ing in which I personally take a great
er interest than this. The United States
was not founded tor production it was
founded to equal opportunity to all for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness. It ia an awful mistake to think
of the man through whose work the pro
duction is made possible as a mere unit
01 production and not as a mere unit
We are all workers I work as hard as
anybody" and so saying the republi
can standard bearer mopped his per
spiring brow and smiled while his au
dience roared with laughter and ap
plause. "In your welfare work," ho con
tinued, "you are doing something that
is really worth while. You are but
tressing democracy. After all the human
factor is the only real factor. The man
who works must feel the country is do
ing right by him. He is entitled to
be safe in iiis work. No man should
be placed in a position where his life,
limb or health is subject to risk.
"That's good 'Americanism' and it's
good business," Hughes declared em
phatically, while his audience applauded
vigorously.
Busy Talking Day.
"After the war, we've got to look out
for ourselves if we ore to maintain our
supremacy. I'm delighted with every
means to provide betterment of living
conditions of workmen so that every
one in the community who works with
his hands can go to work secure and
happy in the thought that he is being
takeikcoie of."
Hughes first campaign speech of the
191H race was the start of a busy talk
ing day for the candidate. He expected
to deliver at least three or four other
speeches. At the Pontchartrain hotel he
conferred with Michigan republicans
from all over the state, some traveling
from the upper peninsula to meet him;
he talked with women suffragists of the
Congressional Union; and late this aft
ernoon he was scheduled to speak a few
words to employes of two or three big
automobile plants not including Mr.
Ford's well known factory, however.
It was announced today that there
was a possibility that the candidate
would visit Nashville, Tenn., on his way
back east from St. Louis early in Sep
tember. Campaign Opens in Chicago. -
Chicago, Aug. 7. Formal launching
of Charles Lvans Hughes' western

This Is Expected To Be
Still Higher
Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 7. With
10 cent bread an issue, the nineteenth

bread.
Increase Seems Certain.
Chicago, Aug. 7. Porspeet of a gen
eral increase in tho price of bread
throughout the country were considered
today by Chicago bakers.
Startling advance in the price of flour
is responsible. This followed sensa
tional advances in the wheat market
due to black rust and storm anil heat
damage throughout the northwest.
"Flour has advanced $1.50 u barrel
in the last month," said John W. Eek
hart, president of the J. W. F.ckhnrt
Milling company, here toduy. "It is
now selling fur 0.25 against $4.75 a
month ago. If there is no change in the
wheat situation soon, it will go a dollar
higher."
