BRITISH CAPTURE3,H5
Defenders Take Fourth of
Attackers and Push the
Rest Into Desert.
London. Aug. 7 (12:50 p. m.)
The Rrifish capfurel :i,115 un
wounded Turks at the battle at
RomanL the war office announced
today. A statement says the Tnrks
were pursned In miles. The pur
suit continued beyond katia,
miles east of the Suez canaL
Tho most recent attempt of tho
Turks to reach the Suez canal has
proven a greater failure than earlier
reports indicated. Lieutenant General
Sir Archibald James Murray, com
mander of the British troops in Egypt,
reports today that besides taking
more than 3,000 prisoners in the battle
with the Turks at Romani, his forces
inflicted very heavy losses on them
and had continued the pursuit 18
miles, clearing the Turks from the
Katia basin.
Military writers cannot fathom why
the Turks ventured upon their at
tack. Their conclusion is that the
Turkish military authorities were mis
led as to the Rritish preparations, de
fense of the canal, and hoped to make
an impression on the rebellious Arabs
who are extending their hold on im
portant places in Arabia.
The Turkish advance as far as Ro
mani was male in the face of the
greatest difficulties, their six-inch
guns being dragged across the desert
by oxen after relays of planks had
been placed to prevent the wheels
sinking into the sand.
"The net results of the battle of Ro
mani are the destruction of more than
one-fourth of the Turkish effectives
and the pushing of the remainder out
into the blazing desert beyond the
Katia eases," said Major General V.
13. Maurice, director of military op
erations of the Imperial general staff,
in explaining to The Associated Press
today the significance of the latest
operations in the near east.
"You will recall," he continued,
"that in the previous attack on the
canal we were busily engaged else
where. Consequently we were acting
on the defensive in Egypt in positions
prepared for that purpose behind the
canal. Since then we have advanced
our position into the desert as fast as
physical conditions warranted.
Waiti'd Advancing Turks.
"The Katia oases possess a surpris
ing quantity of water but it is brackish
and has a disastrous effect on Europ
eans. TheTurks however suffer no
evil effect from its use. This fact gave
the enemy a considerable advantage.
However, by advancing slowly we es
tablished ourselves firmly in en
trenched positions behind Romani and
awaited the Turkish advance from El
arish, an advance of which we had
constant, news from our air service.
"The Turks not. only made a frontal
attack on our entrenched positions but
attempeted to get around our left
flank. Our artillery, infantry and cov
alrv cooperated not only in repelling
but in attacking the enemy, with such
satisfactory results that he is liable
to have an uncomfortable time re
crossing the desert at this season of
the year. Our advance has reached
within a short distance of the edge
of the Katia oases.
Germans Inspire Attack.
"There is no question the Germans
encouraged the latest Turkish attempt
on the canal in an eftort to prevent us
from sending any of our forces to the
western front but the disastrous Te
sult shows we have provided adequate
ly for the safety of the Suez canal. In
accomplishing this we suffered com
paratively few casualties, many of
which consisted of slight wounds."
British KejKtrt.
The statement follows:
"In reference to the fighting in the
Katia district, the general officer com
manding in chief in Egypt reports that
our artillery, rifle and machine gun
(ire was most effective and that the
Turkish losses in killed or wounded
appear from all accounts to have been
very heavy. Rate ou the evening of
August 5, territorial infantry gallant
ly curried a strong rear guard posi
tion. Our pursuit of the Turks has
been continued for a distance of 18
miles and they are now well clear of
the Kat ia-l'maisha basin.
"The number of unwounded prison
ers taken by us now amounts to 45
officers and 3,lu0 men and they are a
very fine body of men."

PEACEFUL END TO
STRIKE EXPECTED
Early Settlement of the ew York
Street Car Trouble Believed in
Sight o Disorders.
New York, Ang. 7. w efforts
of .Mayor .Mitchel and Public Com
missioner Straus to settle the
street railway strike in ew York
failed today. After a protracted
meeting the directors of the .New
York -Railway, company declined
at this time to ratify the tenta
tive agreement proposed by the
two public officials as a basis for
a settle m ut.
New York, Aug. 7. A peaceful end
of the strike on the New York railway
surface car lines which began Friday
night was in prospect today. Meetings
of the union men and of the board of
directors of the railway company
were called at 11 o'clock today to con
sider proposals of settlement which
already had been approved by Presi
dent Shonts of the company and by
representatives of the Amalgamated
Street and Electric Railway Employes
of America
Leaders of both sides promised to
recommend the proposals for ratifica
tion. It was reported that the demands
of the strikers for a wage scale of 30
to 33 cents an hour were granted, to
gether with virtual if not official rec
ognition of their union and an agree
ment to the men's demand that future
differences between them and the
company should be submitted to arbi
tration by a committee representing
tho disputants.
The main contention of the conduc
tors and motonnen has been for the
right to organize without intimidation.
Strikers kept off tho streets in tho
early hours and no disorders were re
ported. President Mahon of the Amalgamat
ed Association of Street and Electric
Railway Employes announced at the
close of the employes' meeting that
the tentative agreement had been rati
fied and that the men were ready to
go back to work if the agreement was
also ratified by the directors of the
New York Railways company. The
latter at that time were still in ses

New York, Aug. 7. -George W. Han

today that a ea result of the confer
ence between representatives of tbe
Switchmen's Union of North America
and the railroads both sides had agreed
to settle their differences by arbitra
tion. The differences between the
switchmen and the railroads are in no
way connected with those pending be
tween the four railroad brotherhoods
of firemen, engineers, conductors and
trainmen. The demands, presented
last March, are, however, virtually
the same as those of the brotherhoods,
an eight hour day and time and a half

The questions at issue will be set

act, Mr. Hanger said.

MORGAN WEALTH
DOUBLED BY WAR
Mates as Much Money in Past Two
Years as His Father Did During
His Whole Career.
New York, Aug. 7. According to the
completed appraisal just made, the es
tate of the late J. P. Morgan was
worth $73,149,000, of which $53,6S4,
91S went to the present J. P. Morgan.
From what was learned last week
the present Morgan firm has made as
much money during the past two
years as the old head of the house
made during his whole career as the
recognized financial and industrial
leader of these United States.
In the first place, under its con
tract with the British government, the
Morgan firm has received a commis
sion of 2 per cent on all munitions
and supplies purchased. Those pur
chased during 1915 and 1916 will foot
up not less than $2,000,000,000. Then
the Morgan firm has received a bank
ing commission on all loans placed for
foreign governments. These loans
now aggregate $1,500,000,000. Then
there has been commissions for the
Morgan firm in selling for the British
government the hundreds and hun
dreds of millions of the foreign-owned
American securities. Then there has
been commissions and interest on call
loans and interest and commission
for stabilizing exchange; that is, for
buying when sterling went down and
selling when the movement was up
ward. In brief, at the most conservative
estimate heard this week, the pres
ent J. P. Morgan has, within the past
two short years already more than
doubled his own personal fortune,
basing the figures on the $53,084,000
which was left to him by his father.
No one has ever made money like that
in this or any other country.

SUB SEEN IS
BELIEVED TO!
BEMERCHANT
Undersea Craft Is Discov
ered Coming Down Off
Coast of Maine.
IDENTITY UNCERTAIN
One Who Sees Vessel Un
able to Confirm Nation-
ality in Foggy Air.
Machiasport, Me., Aug.
7. Captain Small of the
Cross Island coast guard
station reported this morn
ing that his station had
sighted a large submarine
bound west. Its national
ity could not be deter
mined but the captain said
he had no doubt that it
was an undersea craft.
The submarine was coming to
the surface when it was sighted
and after running awash 15 min
utes again submerged. It was
thought that the vessel might be
the German submarine Bremen.
So far as can be learned there are
no l'nited States submarines on
the Main coast.
The look out who sighted the sub
marine later said that he picked the
vessel up In clear weather five miles
to the southeast. As the vessel came
to the surface the look out said he
heard, .several blasts from the signal
horn at fBeIighthouse on Seal island,
a British possession.
It is believed the keeper of the light
house was signalling to the keeper at
Grand Manan light, also British own
ed .that a submarine had been sighted.
Immediately after the whistle sound
ed the submarine submerged. A few
moments later a haze set in and it
was impossible to see more than four
miles off Cross Island.
Cross Island lies close to the Maine
coast. If the vessel is the Bremen,
she was either off her course, or, for
reasons best known to the master of
the merchantman had chosen to come
in close to the enemy's country In
order to arrive , sooner within the
three mile limit.
To be off Cross Island, the subma
rine must have skirted the coast of
Nova Scotia and rounded Sable Island;
thence heading north along the edge
of the Bay of Fundy instead of taking
the most direct route, crossed the
Gulf of Maine to Bar Harbor or Port
land. In Nentral Zone.
The indicated course would bring
her within the three mile limit soon
after she was sighted and from then
on she would have plenty of water to
permit her to keep within the neutral
zone.
Lowell W. Dunn, the lookout on
Cross Island, later reported that he
had sighted a second submarine con
siderably smaller than the first one.
A canvass of naval stations and
builders appeared to establish the
fact that no American submarines
were off this coast. Those close to
naval affairs express the conviction
that no submarine of the entente al
lies was now in Canadian waters or
near tho New England coast.
Says He Saw Two Subs.
"I was standing on tho hill looking
out to sea through my glass," said
Dunn. "It was perfectly clear at the
time, while the water was smooth.
The first of the two submarines ap
peared from beneath the surface at
about 8:25 this morning and I 6hould
Judge that tho hull was 10 or 12 feet
out of the water. Although she was at
a distance of more than five miles off
shore, I could plainly make out what
seemed to be a small tower in tho
middle of the vessel.
"I watched her for a few minutes,
and then shifting my glasses I saw
another smaller submarine "ia mile
ahead of her. Both were bouni) to the
westward. Tho vessel In tbe lea'O soon
submerged and three or four miiHites
after, when 1 turned to take anorJjer
look at the big one, she, too, went be
low tho surface.
'"The submarines were traveling at
the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour. I
am positive tho vessel were submar
ines, for the towers were plainly visible-German
Agent Silent.
Baltimore, Md., Ang. 7. Henry G.
Ililken, senior member of the Eastern
Forwarding company. American
agents of the' German merchant sub
marines, read the Associated Press
dispatch reporting the sighting of a
submarine off the Maine coast today
with interest, but refused to comment
on the possiblity of the craft being the
Bremen or any other German under
water boat. 1
Officials of the company have said
heretofore that the Bremen was com
ing to Baltimore or some other Amer
ican port on the Atlantic seaboard,
and while it has been denied that her
destination was Boston, It might be.
found expedient for her to put lajUk
port. , -
