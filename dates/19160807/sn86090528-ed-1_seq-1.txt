Last Year's Report Held Up as Model;
W. H. Calterall left Saturday for
Annual Convention
W. H. Catterall left Saturday for
Cleveland, O., to attend the American
Poultry association's convention as
delegate from the Oklahoma State
Poultry association. The state secre
tary, Fred Atherton, is in receipt of a
request; from the Mississippi Poultry
Breeders association, requesting the
Oklahoma delegate to take care of
their interests at the national conven
tion. ....
The, conditions in poultry circles in
Oklahoma are exceedingly good. At
the najional convention at San Fran
cisco last year the Oklahoma report
was held up as a model for the rest of
the convention and other states to fol
low. "Our report was the fourth best
report of all the states including those
from Canada," said Mr. Calterall, ' and
in one respect it was considered to be
at thetop as those who excelled us re-
i eeived annual appropriations of from
$.',0,000 to $25C,00 from their respective
state gof ernraents rThilo we receive
nothing from the state. County com
missioners ire authorized to make a p.
proprtations in their districts.
"The conditions this year are flatter
ing. Wo aro alive in membership and
better fixed jn finances, numbers and
organization than Texas. Up to a
short time ago Texas was unable to
send a delegate at its own expense
and w-as casting about for an out-of-state
delegate to look after its inter
ests. The Oklahoma association Is
paying my expenses."
,Mr. Catterall is considered one of
the, largest poultry breeders in the
states. He has a $.1,000 plant and raises
about 2000 chickens every year at 1727

BAFFLED
POLICE BUT
CONFESSED
Sensational Murder Case in Dalla Where
Criminal Eluded Sleuths But Whose
Conscience Hurt Him
Dallas, Tex., Aug. ,7 -Examination
of the special venire of J59- men to se
cure a jury Mr the trial of Houston
Wagner, confessed slayer of Miss
Zonln Cramer, began hero this morn
ing In criminal district court No. 2,'
There is little doubt ot Wugner's
fate, in case the authenticity of a
written confession, signed by him,
and now ir possession of tho county
attorney. Is established to the satisfac
tion of the jury.
Wagner's crime was one of the most
sensational In the annals of local crim
inal history, and his confession Is- the
solution of a mystery '. hich has baf
f!"d solution hy the police and sher
iff's departments for months.
The body of Miss Zoala Cramer, a
young trained nurse, was found in the
outianee of an aljey on the morning
of March 28. She had been choked to
death, and a suit-case which. she ear;
ried was open and the contents, wear-
-Uig apparel, scattered over the ground.
The only clue which offieers found
was a cheap stick-pin, which had be
come entangled in the young woman's
hair, as she battled for her life, No
arrests were made and the Dallas po
lice force had about regaled the easa
to the category of unsolved murder
mysteries, when Wagner, arrested in
McKinney, Texas, on another rharge,
voluntarily confessed to the crime,
saying that his conscience would not
permit him to sleep at night. Ho said
in his confession that he intended to
rob Miss Cramer, but when ho seized
her suit case she fought him, and he
Was forced to choke her to prevent
her screaming. The approach of a
passer-by frightened him away, and
he did not know thai ho had killed the
woman until next morning, when lie
read tho papers.
L. R. Callawuy and N. G. Coffer, ap
poinied by Judge Crawford, are con
ducting Wugner's defense. Jt Is ex
pected that the confession will be of
fered as evidence, and Wagner will
throw- himself on the mercy ot the
court, and endeavor to secure a life
sentence instead of the death penalty,
in view of his confession.
