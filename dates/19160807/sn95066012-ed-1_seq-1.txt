Germany's Master Campaigner Di
recting Affairs on Eastern front
TEUTONS RECAPTURE ONE VILLAGE
Russian, However, Have So Protect
ed Flanks That Direct Progress
Toward Kovel Continues.
IVtrograd, Aug. 6. Since the loss
of Brody by the Austrian-? and the sue
cessful operations of the Russians
against the (jerinans. winch resulted
in their gaining the whole of the line
along the Stokhod and the capture of
several fortilied villages considerably
west of this river on the direct route
to Kovel, the situation on the Russian
General Briisiloli's trout has remained
virtually unaltered.
The Russians by no means have lost
control of the initiative, but another
wave of most energetic German resist
am e has set in and the newly orga
nized! German army, which is com
posed of all available reserves and
fresh recruits, has undertaken the
task of changing its tactics from pas
sive resistance to a most active coiin
teroffenelve. Field Marshal von Him
denburg's personal direction of the
operations in this field is pi-. appar
ent, but it is not thought possible by
the Russian observes that he can
more than check temporarily the ad
vance of the Russian lorres upon
Kovel.
Tho Russians have succeeded in con
solidating all the positions they won
in the recent battle between the Stok-
hod and Kovel, except one village
which they were compelled to jiidd
before a determined Berniaii counter
attack. Meantime Hie Uiislsans. by
gaining control of the northern part
of tin; Stokhod, where It crosses the
Insk maishes. seemingly have flc
lively eliminated all danger of fur
ther flank attacks by the Germans and
are now in a position to continue
their progress along the direct routes
to Kovel without fear of the possible
endrcUngg of their right wing.

Julius Caesar, the most generally
read of Shakespeare's tragedies, Sat
urday afternoon was given its third
production by the organization of Ben
nington people under the auspices of
the Public Welfare association, it
was the only matinee performance and
while the audience was enthusiastic in
its praise of the really wonderfull
work of the amateur actors, those who
had been present on one or both of
the preceding evenings, insisted that
the daylight production lacked much
of equaling the llay as it was given at
night. They also insisted that the
voices of the actors appeared to have
better carrying power ut night than
during daylight.
One who has attended any of the
productions of the tragedy is im-
piessod by two I cut tires: 1st. That so
lurgc a company of amateurs In the
limited time that has been available
could so thoroughly learn the lines of
what are professionally considered
difficult parts; 2d. Thai so many per
sons could be trained in a Brief period
of time to carry out the detail of a
Shakespearean play as It was pre
fected in Clark's Wood's Saturday af
ternoon. There was not a false move from
the instant that the mob tumbles upon
the stage in the tirst act until Hie
tragedy closes with the death of Bru
tus. No one was promoted: no one
hesitated; even the mob moved us
under the hypnotic spell ot an indivi
elmtl -nind.
While the community Is justified In
i sinning to ItSell a considerable
amount ol pride because of the excel
lence of the production, the major por
tion Of the credit must of course go to
the master actor, Mr. Klliot. the In
spiration of whose talent carried his
pupils to heights they could not othcr-
ise have attained, and to the direct
ing genius of Mrs. Klliot which wns
almost uncanny in the results it se
