Lithia Park Makes
Upon Editors of
Editors and their wives to the total
number of 140 were guoBts of Ash
land In Lithia park last Friday even
ing, and It will not be long before
typewriters are hammering out and
pencils are scribbling the glories of
Lithia park and the beauties of Ash
land all over the state. The editorial
party were taken over the high
drives early Friday afternoon and
then over the magnificent Siskiyou
Highway to the summit of the Siski
yous. To a man the visitors pro
claimed the SiBkiyou Highway to be
the greatest mountain road they had
ever traveled. 1
Returning to Ashland, the party
nas taken up through Lithia park to
the picnic grounds, where a unique
luncheon In the form of a box lunch
was served on' the tables beneath the
trees. Coffee was served by a bevy
of charming young ladies of Ashland.
Mayor Johnson welcomed the ed
itors with a brief address in which he
told some of the hlsttyry of the Ash
land park system and invited and
urged the visitors to visit all parts
of the park and the "original camp
ground" particularly. .Phil Bates re
sponded in a brief witty manner. . E.
B. Piper of the Oregonian praised
the hospitable welcome which had
been extended and stated that
"southern Oregon has exceeded all
my expectations." He told two or
three stories of which Major Patton
of Hoqulam, Wash., was the butt, the
major getting even a few minutes
later when he was called upon to
speak. V. B. Jessup, president of
the Washington State Press Associa
tion, gave a short and interesting
talk.
The party then M-oke up to walk
over the park and admire its night
beauties. Practically all of the party
visited the auto camp and all drank
lithia water at the fountains. The
Oakland boys' band in concert enter
tained the visitors for an hour and
many remained for the dance which
followed at the Bungalow,' About
four thousand people thronged the
park for the concert, the crowd mak
ing a lasting Impression as being in
dicative of the, drawing power of the
park.
Every one of the visitors was
charmed with the entertainment pro
vided and amazed at the wonders of
Lithia park, As a matter of fact
Lithia park, next to Crater Lake, was
the sensation of the trip to the ed
itors, and more talk of Ashland and
Lithia park was heard around the
lobbies where the visitors congregat
ed in Medford than of any other fea
ture of the southern Oregon conven
tion, which Is conceded to have been
the "red-letter" convention of the as
sociation In every way.
The city council aided in the enter
tainment of the editors by donating
$50. Arrangements were in the
hands of a committee consisting of
H. 0. Frohbach, E. J. Kaiser, Fred
Wagner and Frank Jordan, and
thanks are due the Commercial Club,
the committee and the ladles who as
sisted in serving.

Liquor Imports
Gain 300 Per Cent
Summer weather, a monster cele
bration and other less important fac
tors contributed to an increase in
the amount of beer shipped into Ash
land of over 200 gallons. The July
shipments included 369 gallons as
against 126 gallons in June, or an
increase of 300 per cent. One hun
dred and fourteen quarts of whiskey
were signed for during the past
month, as against 64 quarts In June.
Alcohol which has not been signed
for in the past was brought in to the
extent of 21 quarts; brandy one
quart and wine one quart. Over half
of this was shipped in within the
first six days of the month, or during
the celebration period, and the police
records show It to have been signed
for mostly by strangers. Many of
the consignees were California people
who either failed to bring a large
enough supply with them or were
afraid that they would be intercepted
and relieved at the border line be
tween the states.
Eleven arrests were made during
the month and nine men who had
drank "not wisely but too well" were
allowed to find accommodations in
the city jail overnight.
Six hundred and nineteen hoboes
were cared for by the police during
July, an average crop. Eighteen
merchants were hauled out in the
early morning hours to come down
and lock doors which they had care
lessly left unlocked. The total ab
sence of any crimes during the cele
bration speaks highly of the efficien
cy of the police.
Travelers May
Register in Hills
District Forester George H. Cecil,
Portland, Ore., has sent to the forest
supervisors of Oregon, Washington
and Alaska a supply of the National
Forest Travelers' Registers, which
were recently issued by the Forest
Service.
These registers will be placed for
use at ranger stations and other
points frequented by tourists, camp
ers, sportsmen and other forest us
ers, to make a permanent record of
travelers on the national forests.
Each page of the register bears the
Forest Service shield, and contains
the following printed notice:
"The national forests are the prop
erty of the people and are adminis
tered and protected for their bene
fit. Care with matches, burning to
bacco and camp fires is essential to
their protection. Tour help is solic
ited. In case of real need, the tele
phone system of the forest is at your
service. If the forest rangers know
where you are going, they may be of
assistance to you. Criticisms or sug
gestions looking to the betterment
of the Forest Service will be appreci
ated if addressed to the District For

Ford Car Rolls Off
Siskiyou Grade
A Ford car, the owner of which is
unknown, rolled off the Siskiyou
grade yesterday, plunging for three
hundred feet, over and over, down
into the canyon below. No traces
were found of driver or occupants,
and as the nvtmber plate had been
taken, undoubtedly no oue was hurt
and the owner wished to escape pub
licity. The tires and number plate
were taken. There was not enough
left of the car to be worth trying to
salvage. From tracks found by Ash
landers who motored over and saw
the car yesterday, it appeared tjjat
the driver must have been turning
around when the car went over. Ap
parently the occupants must have
jumped. The car waa smashed to
pieces.

only fine musicians but a clean, gen,

arrived Thursday afternoon from
Yreka and marched through the busi

"dog tents" in Chautauqua park. On
Friday afternoon they again paraded
the streets and on Friday evening
gave a concert at the main bandstand
in Lithia park which would have been
a credit to many a band of profes
sionals. The selections played ranged
from the new marches to selections
from the old familiar operas with

Dies of Old Age
One of the old pioneers of the

passed away at the home of his son
Frank Payne in Sams valley last
Thursday, death coming from old
age. The deceased man was one of
the early settlers in the valley and

Louis L. Sharp, chief of the field
division cf the general land office,
arrived here last Friday from Port
land and has gone to the camp which
is being established near Pinehurst,
thirty miles east of Ashland on the
Klamath Falls road, to take personal
charge of the commencement of the
work upon the classification of the
Oregon-California land grant lands.
Ten thousand pounds of camp sup
plies have been taken to the camp

who will work under Mr. Sharp are
arriving daily. Thirty cruisers and
surveyors were at the Hotel Austin
Sunday and are being transported to
the camp as fast as possible. The
crew which will commence classifica
tion operations will bo composed of
about one hundred men, sixty of
whom are expert timber cruisers, sui
veyors and land experts. The re
mainder are assistants and camp men.
No men are being hired in Ashland,
the crew being brought In mainly
from Portland.
The workers who are undertaking
the big job of classifying two and a
half mil lion acres of land into min
eral, power and agricultural classifi
cations are the pick of the experts of
the Taclflc coast. Mr. Sharp states
that absolutely no politics were
played in the selection of the men
and every man had to prove that he
could do and had mado a record doz
ing the particular work to which ha
will be assigned.
The crew will commence operations
at the California-Oregon Hue and wilt
work north. Mr. Sharp states that
at present he could not give any defi
nite estimate as to how long the work
will take,' but that no doubt It will
extend over most of two years. The
Jackson county land will be classified
first and may be opened to eutry
within the year.
Mr. Sharp expressed his belief that
the opening of the lands would be a
great thing for the state, but also
stated that he feared that wildcat
stories of fabulously rich land would
bring hordes of people to the land
who would be disappointed because
ine ranches were not to be had on
every hand. He stated that while
Inter he would be nble to tell ruor
definitely, he believed there was
much fine agricultural land nnd tim
ber which the opening of the grant,
lands will open up.

It has been announced . officially
from railroad headquarters that on
August 15 the southern terminal of
the Shasta division will be changed
from Red Bluff to Gerber, a new
town eight miles south of Red Bluff
and three miles north of Tehama.
CJerber will be the dividing point be
tween the Shasta and Sacramento di
visions.
Tho removal of the division point
from Fled Bluff to Gerber has been
In contemplation for several years.
The change was a railroad necessity.
because the growth of business had
made it impossible to handle division
business expeditiously In the yards
in Red Bluff. Larger yards yards
free from street crossings were
needed imperatively. So the com
pany bought a large track of level
ground at Gerber, and there is to bo
tho division point.
Train crews that have been mak
ing their homes In Red Bluff will in
time move to Gerber. The loss to
Red Bluff Is serious, but It has been
discounted for years. '
Locomotive engineers, firemen and
freight crews running on the south
end of the Shasta division will now
have to cover 112 miles, instead of
104 as before. The Bame crews from
