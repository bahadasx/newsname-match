QUESTION
OF ISSUING
ROAD BONDS
WILL BE IMPORTANT BUSINESS
BEFORE COUNTY COMMISSION
ERS AT THIS MEETING BIG
DEMAND.
Although the Board of County Com
missioners have their hands full of
routine Business to be disposed of at
this meeting, they will have added
to their burdens the question of
whether they shall rail an election
for the purpose of ascertaining wheth
er the people desire to issue bonds in
the sum of $100,000 for building per
manent roads.
This question was discussed by th
board and some of the business men
of the county some time ago. and a
tentative agreement was reached
whereby the board Intimated that
they would call the election and put
the matter up to the people. This
will be discussed at this session, and
in all probability some action will be
faken.
Business men of Ardmore, who are
among the heaviest taxpayers of the
county, are all eager for the bonds,
and will urge the commissioners to
call the election. They contend that
they have spent all the money they
Intend to spend in making temporary
repairs, and will make a strenuous
campaign for the bonds all over the
county if the commissioners w ill only
authorize the election.
Volunteer work on the roads of the
county in every precinct for a couple
of days, as recently contemplated,
would do much tow-ard putting ricm
in shape for the fall business, hut
the people are almost a unit for per
manent roads, and the only way Mils
can be .accomplished is by issuing
bonds.
The streets of the city that have
been treated to on oil coating are
CTowing more in favor as they be
come parked and the chance are
