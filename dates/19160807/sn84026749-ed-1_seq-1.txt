By PERRY ARNOLp.
DETROIT, Aug. 7. Republic
an Nominee Hughes' first appeal,
for votes on his campaign tour
for the Presidency was a plea for
Americanism, expression, of a
hope of a get-together spirit of
co-operation between capital and
labor, and indorsement 'of a na
tional movement for welfare of
American workers.
The nominee made the first of
his campaign talks in a stiflingly
close room of the Hotel Ponchar
train to a committee representing
welfare workers of every big fac
tory in Detroit.
There were more than a hun

BERLIN IS CHEERED BY
DIPLOMATIC VICTORY
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
BERLIN, Aug. 7. Failure of the British to make any important
headway in their great offensive on the Somme front and a fresh de
feat for allied diplomats in Roumania have inspired the German pub
lie with fresh confidence. ,
All reports from Bucharest and Vienna Indicate that the Balkin
situation la again satisfactory to the Central powers. Reports from
Stockholm declare keen disappointment is felt in Fetrograd over the
failures of the allied ,UplomaU' latest maneuvers at Bucharest
Satisfied that they could not induce Roumania to enter the war,
the allies attempted another coup in the negotiations Just closed. They
asked that Russia be permitted to send troops through Roumania to in
vade Hungary, thus evading the Carpathian mountain barrier. Russia
guaranteed to defend Roumania from attack should Austria declare war
on Roumania.
Halting of the Russian advance in the southeast and the allies'
failure to break through the German lines in the west were factors
that aided Germany greatly at Bucharest.
The allies, it is understood here, have now practically discontinued
their efforts to win Roumania's favor.
