II E. Hughes, speaking today to 40
-- manufacturers of Detroit and
vxinity, employing nearly 100,000 men.
. it ngratulated them upon -what they

fctand for a continuation of "this al
leged strife between capital and la
bor." He declared that the American
v orkman should not be regarded as a
-iere economic unit, but as "a fellow
worker, a human being."
Mr. Hughes's address was impromptu

publicly.
IVe Are All "Working Men.
Tn his address to the manufacturers,
Mr. Hughes said in part:
"It is an awful mistake to think of
I he men through whose activity pro-
lurtion is possioie as mere economic
units. "We are all working men Tn this
country. We are in different spheres
of activity, but we ought to have a
sense of cooperation so that every man
takes pride in what he is doing, and
n doing it to the best of his ability,
because he Is working alongside of
e ery other man for the good of the
country.
Human Factor In Mont Important.
In your welfare work you are but
tissing democracj. The human factor
is after all the ipiportant factor. You
may develop j our physicial plants,
' our physical instrumentalities, dis
i . ibution and everything that goes to
make up the material side of pros
perity but you are absolutely hopeless
without the human factor: and in
.m-rica, the land of free men, the man
r Mho is at work for a living must feel
. tli at the country is doing the right
thing by him. He is entitled to be
s. fe in his work, to have every pre
caution taken against every sort of
a cident that can be prevented.
Man .Mont Work or Starve.
"A man is put at work- How can he
i fuse the job which stands between
h.m and starvation? It is perfectly
u'le to sa. in our industrial condi
tions, that he can take or refuse the

LEHUSTS IMPLICATED II PLOT
Col. Tamez, Who Revolted With Nine Men Friday Night
in Juarez, Still at Large; Five of His Followers Sent
to Chihuahua City; Prisoners Claim They
Were Deceived By Col. Tamez.
T
EX men in all took part in the re
volt of CoL Marino Tamez. at Jua
rez. Fridav evening, according to
a statement given out Monday morning
by Gen. Francisco Gonzales, commander
of the garrison at Juarez. Five of
these, according to the general, were
captured at Zaragosa, a few miles due
south of Juarez. Sunday afternoon, and
were sent to Chihuahua city Monday
morning.
"The prisoners told me that they
were deceived into joining Col. Tamez's
hand through misrepresentation," said
Gen. Gonzales. Monday morning. "Ac
cording to the story, they -were told
that they were going on an errand for
me to join some cavalry troops that I
had sent out. They took no money
with them."
File at Lnrgc.
According to the commander, the
men still at large are CoL Tamez. Jose
de la Paz. Jose Jaurrieta. Jose Rodri
guez and S. Tarrazas. Gen. Gonzales
stated that he had heard nothing of the
pursuing forces he had sent out, nor
would he give their number.
During an Interview with mayor M.
M. Prieto and Gen. Gonzales. Saturday
night, Crescenio Chavira, one of the
prisoners taken at Zaragoza. stated
that he was lured into accompanying
the party by representations that its
object was merely that of finding a
site for a picnic that was to have been
held Sunday. He later said he had been
infqrmed that he men were bound "for
Casas Grandes or Chihuahua, city.
Chavlrn Sot Believed.
"Personally, I do not believe Cha
vira's yarns protesting his innocence,"
said mayor Prieto Sunday. "I oelieve
that he knew full well what was In
the air. I do believe, however, that h-3
did not have much stomach for the
business, since just before he wa cap

Five Olher Arreted.
Five others though to be implicated
in the Tamez plot were arrested in
Juarez Saturday. A detachment of I0O
men are in pursuit of the other six
insurgents, and word has been sent
to other garrisons throughout the rtate
of Chihuahua to be on the lookout for
the fugitives. It is believed that Gen.
Gonzales's troops will be able to starve
out, Tamez and his followers, since
they are said to have been poorly sup
plied. Took 'o Money.
"I am sure that Tamez did not take
any money with him." said mayor
Prieto. "My reason for thinking this
is that the day before the desertion oc
curred, one of his adherents tried to
borrow $5 from him. and did actually
borrow my horse. Tamez borrowed a

a proclamation that would have any

ACHIAS PORT. Maine. Aug. 7
M
Capt. Small, of the Cross Island
coast guard station, reported
this morning that his station had
sighted a large submarine westbound.
Its nationality could not be determined
but the captain said he had no doubt
that it was an undersea craft. The
submarine was coming to the surface
when it was sighted and after running
awash 15 minutes, again submerged. It
was thought that the vessel might be
the German submarine Bremen. So far
as can be learned there are no United
States submarines on the Maine coast.
The lookout who sighted the sub
marine later said that he picked the
vessel up In clear weather five miles
to the southeast. As the vessel came
to the surfaee the lookout said he heard
several blasts from the signal horn at
the lighthouse on Seal Island, a British
possession.
U. Ilont Hear Ulnst; Ditex.
It is believed that the keeper of the
lighthouse was signalling to the keeper
at Grand Manan light, also British
owned, that a submarine had been
sighted.
Immedaitely after the whistle sound
ed the submarine submerged. A few
minutes later a haze set in and it was
impossible to see more than four miles
off Cross Island.
Second Submarine Siehted.
Lowell W. Dunn, the lookout on
J Cross Island, later reported that he
!had sighted a second submarine con
siderably smaller than the first one.

Many Counties of the States of New Mexico and Arizona

An Exhibit, Declares George R. LeBaron, and
He Tells Why This Is the Case.
N"
EW MEXICO'S hearty willing-
ess to cooperate with the pro
moters of the International Soil
Products exposition, which will open
in EI Paso in October, was manifest
in a letter received this morning from
Col. IV. S. Hopewell, of Albuquerque,
vho Is Instrumental hi organizing New
Mexico's exhibit. CoL Hopewell says:
"We will have -a big general exhibit
at El Paso, with all sorts of farm
products and minerals from New Mex
ico, and will compete for the states
prize. The people from New Mexico
will be down to El Paso in large num
bers. VT. P. Southard, president of the
New Mexico state fair board, and man
ager of the Albuquerque Light & Tower
company, will soon be in El Paso to
have a conference with you respect
ing arrangements for the exhibit."
A Great Show.
"The exposition in El Paso In Octo
ber will be the greatest thing that
ever happened in this section." said
George R. Le Baron, chairman of the
El Paso advisory committee of the
enterprise.
"In view of the railroad rates we
already have secured, and those vj
are confident will be conceded to us.
we are sure that excursionists will
pour In upon the city from all the
cities accessible by railroad within a
distance of 600 miles, in addition, there
will be incalculable crowds from more
distant points, the attendance being
arawn irom an area comprising 39
states, not to mention the delegates
and visitors from abroad.
Important Meeting.
"It Is this which makes the Inter
national Soli Products exposition ex
ceedingly important to EI iaso as a
business proposition, to say nothing of
our citizens' pride and pleasure In fig
uring so conscicuously in the eyes of
the world. The fact that 56 foreign
governments are receiving invitations
issued by the department of state at
Washington, to send exhibits of their
products, or delegates, to EI Paso, for
this supreme event, sufficiently Justi
fies local enthusiasm. So does the
prospect of a great gala event in which
will figure innumerable entertainment
features, free to the public; profuse
and brillianr displays of all kinds of
goods, and mirth and music and the
prevalence of a carnival humor for
ten days together. But from the busi

Time I Opportune.
"There could not be a more oppor
tune time for an exposition of this
sort, for El Paso has of late been mak

a very important rank among the
cities of the west. Particularly as a

Recently, the manager of one of the

turing, producing and financial city.
After most searching inquiries, he left
El Paso- expressing the greatest de
gree of satisfaction and a Iivelv en

be gratifying to every man of affairs f T W,UUA- "
whose Interests are centered here.
Decision A'ery Favorable.
"The exposition, is, therefore, a most
oportunr event. It comes in time to
celebrate our emergence from the rank
of provincial elites, and our accession
to the class of 'towns that have to be
reckoned with.' There could not be a
more favorable occasion than the expo
sition will afford to display our opu

petence, and signalize our entrance into
the trade arena as the preeminent,
predominant city of this section of the
world.
"One of the most gratifying an
nouncements that have been made in

is that relating, to. the. enthusiastic
participation of Arizona and New Mex

the cooperative spirit evinced by these
neighboring states. It is another
proof that our prosperity Is theirs, and
theirs, ours.
"We members of t"e advisory com
mittee of the exposition entertain the
expectation that this event in October
'will be the first of an interminable
series of annual events of the kind, all
contributing to the glory and affluence
of El Paso as the pivotal city toward

The forward push of the Russians in
