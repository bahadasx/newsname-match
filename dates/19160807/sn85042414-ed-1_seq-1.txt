Russians Make Further Suc

Repulsed.
London, Aug. 7.—The description of
how the Turks were drawn into a trap
at Romani by the British cavalry is
given in a Cairo dispatch to the Ex
change Telegraph company. The dis
patch says the cavalry was well out
to entice the enemy, who had showed
a disposition to assume the offensive.
British horsemen fought an admir
able rear guard action, says the dis
patch, drawing on the Turks until the
flanks were turned by a mounted di
vision. The whole brigade was com
pelled to surrender. Among the pris
oners were 70 Germans, including 36
officers. A complete battery of Ger
man machine guns also was taken.
Russians Continue Successes.
Petrograd, Aug. 7.—(Via London).
—Further successes for the Russians
along Sereth and Graberka rivers in
northern Galicia, south of Brody, are
announced by the war office today.
The Russians captured strongly forti
fied positions in the region of the vil
lages of Zvyjln, Kostinieo and Re
nluv.
Counter-attacks Repulsed.
London. Aug. 7.—Several small
counter-attacks by the Germans east
of Pozieres last night were repulsed,
the war office announced today. The
Germans are bombarding British po
sitions between Alcre and Somme.
Turks Defeat .oil.
London, Aug. 7.—The strong Turk
ish force which attacked the British
at Romani, 22 miles east of the Suez
canal, on August 4, was defeated and
put to flight by a counter attack, says
an official statement issued yesterday.
The Turks, adds the statement, are
vigorously pursued by the British,
who have taken more than 2,500 pris
oners, including some Germans.
The official announcement says:
"The general officer commanding
in chief reports under date of 11:15 p.
m. August 5, the following details 'of
the fighting in the vicnity of Romani
jjap*. August 6:,.. ..
"The enemy made a frontal attack
on the British entrenchments in con
junction with a flank attack arouwiJ
the southern flank, employing 14,000
men and heavy howitzer for the oper
ation.
"The frontal attack was unsuccess
ful. Before the flank attack our
mounted troops retired slowly and the
enemy became involved in sand dunes
late in the evening of the fourth.
"A counter attack was then made
by all arms, which was completely
successful and at dawn on the fifth,
the pursuit of the retreating enemy
was taken up with vigor and is be
ing continued at the time this report
is sent.
"The enemy suffered heavy losses.
By 8 p. m. on August 5, over 2,500
unwounded prisoners, including some
Germans, four mountain guns and a
number of machine guns had been
captured. Our casualties were not
heavy.

With the British Armies in France,
Aug. 5, via London Aug. 7.—Under a
merciless concentration of shell fire,
the Australians are holding onto their
gains today after their advance last
night on a front of two miles. The
Germans already have delivered three
powerful counter attacks to retake the
lost ground and all have failed.
In one of the counter attacks the
Germans came forward holding up
their hands. Behind them the British
guns pl&ypd curtains of shell fire
through which it was impossible for
them to retreat while the Australians'
machine guns and rifles, mowing
them down, made it hopeless to con
tinue the charge. It was death which
ever way they moved—death if they
stood still or laid down in the bullet
swept space and they surrendered
rather than continue their vain efforts.
Their last previous attack having
been by the right flank, the British
renewed the offensive by the left
flank after a week of bombing and
sapping. Here the task fell to the
Australians, who added another vic
tory to their brilliant record In the
taking of Pozieres. In grilling heat,
under a biasing sun, they had been
working in a continual shell fire, dig
ging their new trenches in the open
beyond Pozieres, facing the German
second line trenches on the left, of
the break the British already had
made in their previous attacks.
This was one of the remaining im
portant positions on the high ground
which baa been so bitterly contested
by all the gun power cunning and
stubbornness both sides could bring
to bear- Upon this section of strong
field fortifications with deep dugouts
the British kept up a tornado of shell
fire of all calibers. They smashed the
defenses into irregular mounds of
earth which had no semblance to
trenches.
Not only did the German guns re
turn the compliment on the Aus
tralian front line, but kept up curtains
of flrp behind it. The Germans man
aged to stick to the ruins of their for
tifications, digging new cover as fast
as what they had was destroyed. Evi
dently the German staff had deter
mined this ridge summit must be held
at any, cost.
"When w* go, we go," say the Aus­
$
In holding the strong flank attack and
an energy and activity worthy of the
highest praise in the pursuit. Terri
torial troops from England have done
exceedingly well especially in
maneuvering over heavy sand in spite
of the great heat.
"The monitors firing from the Bay
of Tina assisted materially in the op
erations while the work done by the
Royal Firing corps was excellent."
Teutonic Resistance Broken.
Petrograd, Aug. 7.—Russian at
tacks along the Sereth and Graberka
rivers, south of Brody, in northern
Galicia, broke the Teutonic resistance
and resulted in the capture by the
Russians of six villages and the en
tire ridge along which they are locat
ed, according to a war office an
nouncement today. More than 3,000
prisoners were taken:
"Western front: South of Brody
on the banks of the rivers Gradark
and Sereth obstinate fighting con
tinued during the whole day for the
possession of villages and heights. The
enemy offered determined resistance
and made several counter attacks. In
the streets of the villages fierce fight
ing took place and it was necessary to
drive the enemy out from house to
house.
"Our attack was crowned with suc
cess, all counter attacks of the enemy
being repulsed and his resistance
broke. Our troops have taken the
villages of Zvyjln, Ratische, Topisto
pady, Meidzigory, Gnidava and Zal
voce and the entire ridge of the
heights between them. One of our
gallant Cossack regiments made a
cavalry attack on an enemy infantry
battery to the southwest. In these
engagements 95 officers and more than
3,000 men were taken prisoner.
"In the region of Dora, Yaremche
and Tablonitsa, on the river Pruth,
to the south of Deltyn, the enemy
took the offensive, but was brought
to a standstill by our fire.
"Caucasus front—In the basin of
the river Kialkit-Cfcla, our troops con
tinued their offensive and wrested new
positions from the enemy which, in
some places were protected by five
lines of trenches. They took prisoners
seven officers, including the comman
der of the R2nd regiment and 108
Askaris. They also captured four
machine guns. Enemy counter attacks
were repulsed.
"To the south of Erzingan we cap
tured two lines of trenches, four offi
cers, fifty Askaris and two machine
guns- The enemy suffered severe
losses.
"In the region west of the village
of Ognut we advanced several versts
and captured two heights.
"In the region of Mush and Bitlls
the enemy assumed the offensive, but
is being held by our fire.
"In the Black sea our torpedo boats
destroyed forty-two small sailing craft
off Keerasun and bombarded boats
and store houses at Samsun."
STEAMER TORJEDOED.
Copenhagen, Aug. 7, (via London),
—The Norwegian newspaper Tidens
Tegn of Christiania states that the
steamer Aaro (a British vessel of 2,
603 tons owned by T. Wilson Sons &
Co. of Hull) has been torpedoed by a

Chicago, Aug. 7.—A series of as

Taxicab company's automobiles, re
senting efforts to unionize the chauf
feurs, according to John W. Hertz,
manager of the company, culminated
today in the explosion of a bomb at

but for a big bite of the cherry."'
The Germans were surprised and
even the brltish staff was somewhat
surprised when it was found first re
ports were correct and they had taken
every rod of the front which they had
attacked with their usual swift rush.
Some 6,000 prisoners frere started
back, but even after their surrender
their lives were not safe for they had
to pass through the German curtain
of shell fire behind the Australians,
which had been maintained increased
volume all day.
With this additional front the Brit
ish now hold five miles of the former
German second line. The Australians
are today in sight of Martlnpuich and
Courcelette. This new advance which
was at right angles to the former Ger-,
man angles to the former German
first line, literally was part of a maze
of German dugouts and trenches of
the first line in a sharp where the
angle formed. Beyond is Thlepvalon
the summit of a hill where the British
attack of July 1 met its heaviest losses
and was repulsed by machine guns
brought out of dugouts. Now this
whole section could be but under the
enfilading fire of British gunq.
"Whenever I look at that new Ger
man salient," said an officer who suf
fered in the Tpres salient, "I feel
avenged. We never had a worse one.'*
In the war for position the general
opinion is that the value of this latest
gain cannot be over-estimated, and the
heavy bombardment which is proceed
ing in that neighborhood indicates
that the Australians will have stiff
job holding this new position. Uni
versal, satisfaction is expressed by the
British staff at their success thus far
in maintaining their gains, although
German artillery concentrates in in
creasing force and arrivals of rein
forcements of German infantry con
tinue to be reported.
Never have operations been more of

Through the days of the recent period

Lang, who Sunday night confessed
to the murder of Louis H. Larson,
a wealthy Mott farmer, was spirited
away from the Hettinger county
jail during the night ana taken to
JMcklnson for safe keeping from
the hands of two mobs. One baud
was that of 150 farmers bent on
lynching the I. W. W. farm hand,
who slew his employer last Tues
day and the other mob was of
W. W. members who threatened a
jail delivery-
After hours of cross questioning
by officials Sunday night a written
confession was secured from Lang.
He admitted that he killed Larson
with a heavy weight from an old
scale, but claiming: that Larson had
first hit him on the head with a rock.
I. W. W.'s from all nearby points
concentrated and threatened an at
tack on the Mott jail.
State's Attorney Crane authorized
50 deputies who were sworn in and
an armed force stood guard at the
jail. Meanwhile the 150 farmers
from the Regent country met and
started for Mott. Only a' terrific
rain storm which stalled automo

(Herald Special Service.)
Mott, N. D., Aug. 7.—Frank Lu

er I. W. W., confessed this morning to
the murder of Louis H. Larson, a
Mott .farmer, the pollcfe say.
Lang, maintains he and- Larson
quarreler, Larson calling him ugly
names. The murder followed, Lang
crushing Larson on the head with a
rock and concealing his body, which
was discovered several hours later.
Today armed deputies guard the
jail in which Lang Is confined, to pre
vent the threatened delivery of the
prisoner by a great gang of I. W. W.'s,
supposedly headed this way, and re
ports. from several points around
Mott indicate this city is being made
the goal of hundreds of malcontents.
Many I. W. W.'s were driven out of
here Saturday night and Sunday.
"Wobblers," as I. W. W.'s have be
come known, used knives in a pitched
battle with one crowd of citizens, and
two I. W. W.'s were badly beaten up
during a general fight.
Planned to Lynch Him.
Regent, N. D., Aug. 7.—One hun
dred farmers, determined to prevent
the I. W. W. plot to free Lang, the
alleged confessed murderer held at
Mott, were prepared to take Lang
from the jail and lynch him, but
muddy roads and the lack of leaders,
it is said, prevented the execution of
the plot.
Today calm prevails locally, but
officials at Mott have been advised to
get Lang out of the way. They will
take him to Dickinson this afternoon
for safety, both from enraged home
steaders and friends of the murdered
man and I. W. W.'s, said to be headed
this way to aid Lang.

INFANT PLAGUE
Sixth Week Begins Today
—Over 5,000 Cases have
Been Reported.
New York, Aug. 7.—Today marked
the beginning of the sixth week of the
epidemic of infantile paralysis and
the daily bulletin Issued by the health
department showed that the plague
continues unabated. During the 24
hours preceding
10
o'clock this morn­
ing, 44 children died of the disease
in the five boroughs of New York City
and 145 new cases were reported.
Since the inception of the Epidemic,
there have been 5,186 cases, of which
1,143 fatal.
The president, in discussing the
need for more revenue said in his
message that "we should be following
an almost universal example of mod-
come
taxes.
He then added the more specific
suggestion which advocates of the ex
emption reduction have called to the
attention of, their colleagues that "by
somewhat lowering the present limits
of exemption and the figure at which
the sur tax shall begin to be Imposed
and by Increasing step by step
throughout the present graduation
the surtax itself, the Income, as at
present apportioned would yield sums
sufficient to balance the books of the
treasury at the end of the fiscal year
1917, without anywhere making the
burden unreasonably or oppressively
heavy."
The amendment would lower the
exemption for persons with families
from $4,000 to (3,000, and for single
persons from $3,000 to 12,000. Demo
crats who oppose the reduction say
the amount of revenue to be gained
would not be sufficient to warrant
risking possible papular disapproval.
The treasury department has estimat
ed that the new tax, which would be
at the rate of one per cent instead of
the proposed normal tax of two per
oent on other Incomes, would yield
about M.000,000. This amount, op

voted Saturday to lower the income

ca.l issue in the national campaign.
Yesterday members of the sub
committee considering the munitions
tax section of the revenue bill were
at work on their report which will bej
ready in a few days. Protests against
the proposed tax on copper products
have resulted in a compromise, the
exact nature of which has not been,
disclosed. It is known, however, that
it is proposed to lower the copper ex-|
else rate prescribed in the house bill,
an to ad to it on is -j
cess taxes on products of lead, rlnc,
iron and steel. Again the committee'
had the sanction of President Wilson'
in so far as iron and steel are con-!
cerned. The president studied thh,
subject thoroughly last fall and in his
message to congress pointed out that
a tax of 25 cents per ton on pig iron
would yield in revenue Sl-O.OOO.OOfr
and a tax of 25 cents per ton on
fabricated iron and steel probably
$10,000,000.
Administration leaders regard the
revenue problem now as the moeti
important before congress*and the
nance committee hopes to complete
its revision of the house bill so that
it may be passed upon by the party'
caucus and be ready for senate ac
tion within ten days. The House bill
would provide for about $210, OOO.MMr
in revenue. The finance committee is
working to present a bill that would
yield $276,000,000 or more.
