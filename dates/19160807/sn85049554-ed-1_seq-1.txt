iPv-'.-/
^General Brusiloff Is pressing
his offensive against the Teutonic
allies In northern Galieia, where
the passage of the river Sereth was
recently forced by the Russians,
on a wide! ront, south of Brody.
Petrograd today reports further
progress for the Russians
The forward push of the Rus
sians in this sector is not only
bringing them closer to Lemberg,
on the direct line of advance, but
is pointed out by military critics
as likely seriously to endanger .the*
entire Auatria.o --front along the
Strijja«~tt'Hie south, which is rap
Idly being outflanked.
Heavy fighting continues on the
western front in the Verdun region.
According to Paris, however, the
Germans have been entirely un
successful in their efforts to re
gain ground lost to the French in
General Nivelle's vigorous offen
sive of last week. An attack on
the Thiaumont works is declared
to have been checked at the outset
by the French fire barrier, while an
assault in the Vaux-Chapitre
woods was broken up by the artil
lery and machine guns.

British reports of the fighting
east of the Suez canal in Egypt,
shows a crushing defeat oX the
Turks, who are said to have lost
one-fourth of their effectives,
which numbered some 14,000 men.
London, Aug. 7.—The recent attempt
the fcurka to readh the^ujw oana*
has proved a greater failure than at
first .reported. Lleut.-Gen. Sir Arehi
bald Jatnes Murray, commander of the
British troops in Egypt, reports today
that besides taking more than 3,000
prisoners in the battle with the Turks
at Romani, his forces inflicted very
s.
heavy losses on them, and had con
tinued the pursuit tor eighteen miles,
-clearing the Turks from the Katla
basin.
Military writers are unable to
fathom the reason why the Turks ven
tured upon their attack. The only con
clusion reached is that the Turkish au
thorities were misled as to the prep
arations for the defense of the canal,
and hoped to make an impression on
the rebellious Arabs.
The Turkish advance as far as Ro
mani was made in the face of the
greatest difficulties, their sir-Inch guns
being dragged across the desert by
oxen, after relays of planks had been
placed to prevent the wheels sinking
into the sand.

drive of the British thru German Ease
Africa is reported in an official state

of a portion of the coal miners of
South Wales and the cotton workers of
Lancashire, the British working people
tod ay loyally accepted the decision of
the government that holidays should
be postponed until the demand for
munitions should not be urgent. The
South Wales miners decided last week
to observe today—bank' day—as usual,

homes, but he will publicly express
his reprobation of the action of the
German authorities if his protest is ig
nored.
OVERMAN ATTACKS
CHILD LABOR BILL
8ena!br Insists Issue Should be Sub
fhlma'^S States aa Conatitutional
Amendment—Sees Centralisation of
Power at Waahington./
Washington. Aug. 7.—An attack on
the constitutionality of the'' pending
child labor bill was made in the sen
ate today by Senator Ovesman, of
North Carolina. He insisted that the
issue should be submitted to the states
as a constitutional amendment.
"It this legislation is constitutional,"
he declared, "there will be nothing
left for the right of states, but there
will be an absolute absorption of the
police powers of the forty-eight sov
ereign commonwealths, and there will
be no barrier in the way of centrali
zation of all power In Washington, to
which goal we are now rapidly drift
ing.
"This bill is not for the purpose of
regulating commerce but its main
purpose is under the guise of regu
lating conjxncrcc, to regulate produc
tion in the manufacturles and mills
of the country. It is to put a state
under duress and compel it to do that
which some states have done, In order,
as has been stated in this debate,
to have uniformity."
Senator Overman submitted sta
tistics designed to show a beneficial
effect upon society from child labor.
Records for 1910, he said, showed
that in southern child-employed states
that only fifteen children In 1,000 be
tween the ages of 14 and 16 years,
were committed to Jail or workhouses
as compared with 279 In Massachu
setts, 199 in Rhode Island and 122 in
Missouri.

Washington, Aug. 7.—Showers to
night or tomorrow over much of the
country east of the Mississippi are

Coaat Cause Vessel to Resubmerge—
Pilot of Deutschland Telia How Ship
Dived Under Noses of Britiah
Cruisers and Escaped.
Poitland, Maine, Aug_7.—A subma
rine was sighted five miles off the
coast by a lookout at the coast guard
station on Cross island at 11:25 this
forenoon. It was moving west but the
weather was thick and its nationality
could not be made out.
The submarine was sighted as she
was coming to the surface. Fifteen
minutes later she submerged.
The lookout who sighted the subma
rine later said that he picked the ves
sel up in clear weather Ave miles to
the southeast. As the vessel came to
the surface the lookout said he heard
several blasts from the signal horn
from the lighthouse on Seal Island, a
British possession. It was believed the
keeper was signaling to the keeper at
Grand Mannin light.
Immediately after the whistle
sounded the submarine submerged. A
few moments later a haze set in and it
was impossible to see more than fou«
miles off Cross Island-
W. D. Dunn, the lookout, later report
ed that he had sighted a second sub
marine, considerably smaller than the
first one.
Cross island lies close to the Maine
coast. If the vessel was the Bremen
she was either off her course or was
taking a different route for reasons best
known to her master.

Washington, Aug. 7.—Navy officers
said today no American submarines
were known to be anywhere' in the vi
cinity of Cross Island. They thought
the boat sighted there might be the
German submarine Deutschland or her
sister ship Bremen, bound in for tha
United States.
TELLS OF DEUTSCHLAND ESCAPE
Pilot Saya it Was Swallowed Up by
Wave* and Dived Under Enemy Ship.
Baltimore, Md., Aug. 7.—'How the
submarine Deutschland was able to
escape the allies: warships, whiqh had
lam In wait for it, was described to
day by a man who witnessed the get
away on Aug. 2.
The narrator was one of the men
nearest the submarine when it began
the dash he was aboard it when if
left Baltimore. He is Capt. Owen
Coleman, mariner and pilot. He re
turned to Baltimore from Norfolk to
day.
Dived Under Enemy Craft.
"You may rest assured," he said,
"that the Deutschland is hitting It up
for Its home port and that it's nearly
there. When I-left on the night of
Aug. 2 the submarine was speeding
straight to sea. It merely disappeared
and ducked almost beneath the ships
of the allies. Because of its dirty
green and white streaked hull it re
sembled an ordinary ocean wave. It
is possible and probable that it had
submerged after we had lost sight of
it. If I judged its master correctly, it
likely ducked under the nose of an
enemy ship. Capt. KoenIg*s a great
one for this Irony stuff.
"We watched It for several hours—
that is we watched for It thru marine
glasses—but It Just seemed suddenly to
evaporate. I think It was an il
lusion. That paint works wonders. We
could see the horizon and could scan
the wrinkled face of the sea, but we
saw only waves."
Crew Show "No Fear.
Regarding the crew of the subma
rine Captain Coleman said he had
never seen men so happy at being
homeward bound.
"There was not the slightest sign of
fear among them," he said. "They
were plainly exuberant. They spoke
with the greatest praise of the treat
ment they reelved In Baltimore and
asserted that they carried back with
them the most pleasant memories of
their stay here. But they were glad
for one thing, to get away from the
heat and also to get on the final lap of
the trip which will make them
famous."

Two French Soldiers
Capture 100 Germans
With Hand Bombs
Paris, Aug. 7.—Corporal Goutean
bier, of the French light infantry, has
been decorated with a military cross
by President Poincare, for capturing
100 Germans, including two officers,
aided only by a single companion.
The reference to his exploit in army
orders reads:
"For bravery and contempt of dan
ger, which struck terror into the
trenches and shelter of the enemy.
With a single comrade he has made
100 prisoners, including two officers,
whom he took to the rear, and then
rejoined his post."
In telling of his experiences at the
request of President Poincare the cor
poral said:
"It was on July 20. before Hem
wood. The French troops had swept
over the German trenches. However,
from a hollow toward the right, a well
sustained fusilade was being poured
011 the flank of the attackers."
Gouteaubler, who was at the right
wing of the second wave, called out
to one man:
"Gulllot, come with me."
The two men approached the spot
whence the firing came. They'glided
from tree to tree until they were close
to the German shelter. Gulllot threw
bombs as fast as he could into the
midst and the fire ceased.
"Surrender," shouted the corporal.
In response to his demand 100 Ger
mans emerged from the shelter with
uplifted hands.
"Pass along this way," shouted the
corporal from his hiding place.
"Go out of the wood at once and
march to the rear."
Two minutes later the 100 Germans
shepherded by the corporal and his
aide, arrived at the French lines. The
prisoners admitted that some of their
comrades remained in the shelter.
"Come on, GuilloC let us go and
fetch them," said the corporal. The
two men started back, but Gulllot fell
with a bullet in his breast and the
corporal had to abandon his enter
prise.
the army bill was not mentioned. The
war department objects to the war
amendment.

made by the department of healtu and
several physicians,foremost in the light
against the plague.
Physicians said that in the absence
of sufficient serum with which to make
teste its value has not been pr.ivtd, but
indicated there was a possibility that
administered early enough it would
prevent paralysis and save the patient
from becoming crippled. There has
been much discussion of this .-Iriim.

called at 11 o'clock today to consider
proposals of settlement, already ap

for a wage scale of 32 to 33 cents an

tual, if not official, recognition of their
union, and an agreement to the men's
demand that future differences between
them and the company should be sub

AS YET UNSETTLED
Judge McColl Says Contentions of
Plaintiff Are True But That He Has
No Right to Interfere With. Powera
Granted Munioipalitiea by 8tate
Case Probably Will Be Appealed.
Special to Times-Republican.
Eldora, Aug. 7.—The first lap In tho
legal battle between Iowa Trills electric
companies has been traversed, and the
courts hero refused to enjoin the new
company from erecting lines and doing
business.
Judge E. N. MoColl, of Nevada, has
filed his findings in the case of Charles
E. Raymond against the Iowa Falls
Electric Company and others. Suit was
brought by Raymond as owner of the
old electric company against the new
company asking for an Injunction on
tho ground that the new concern had
constructed its lines so as to interfere
with the old company's lines, in that
they were parallel and that the thread
ing of the "leads" was dangerous to
property and to the general public. The
new company set up as a defense that
the franchise under which the old com
pany was doing business was null and
void and that the construction of new
lines was under the control and direc
tion of electrical inspectors created and
employed by the city council of Iowa
Falls.
Old Franchise Good.
The court finds that the franchise
un,der which the old company Is oper
ating is valid and also sustains the
contention that the construction work
of the new company creates a condition
dangerous to life and property, but that
the power and control of construction
Is so completely given over to munici
palities by the state that the court had
no Jurisdiction to Interfere therewith.
On that ground the court refused to
grant an injunction,
The case involved the faking of a
great deal of evidence and occupied ap
proximately two months time In the
making of the Iqsucs and taking of ev
idence. The Iowa Falls Electric Com
pany, or the new company. Is controlled
by the Dows-Reed syndicate of Cedar
Rapids, while the old company fs
owned by H. L. -Clark, of Chicago. The
case probably will be appealed.

ought to have a sense of co-operatlein
so that every man takes pride In what
ho la doing."
Human Factor Important.
"The human factor is after alt the
Important factor. He is entitled to be
safe in his work, to have every precau
tlon taken against every sort of accl-!
dent that can be prevented. A man ts
put at work. iHow can he refuse the
job which stands between .him and'
starvation? It Is perfectly ldle^tO' say
In our industrial conditions t|U|t he can I
take or refuse the work Moordlng to
his Idea of the safety appliances which
may bo provided to proteot hlm. Yoa
have got to proteot hicn. Mo man can'
work in any position where his -life, hi*
limb or his health Is subject to risk*.!
And we will get thru this old strlfa1
between labor and capital. Democracytf
can not stand-it. We are not'laborers
and capitalists in this country. We are
fellow citizens.
"That Is what I stand for, and theire-,
fore, because you enrloh our cltlaen

foundations of our society. I greet you,
and I wish you the best success In your
