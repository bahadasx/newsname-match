f TALK OF FUSION

Some Democrats Think "Love

Meeting Tomorrow
WHICH SIDET0YIELD
IS NOT IN FORECAST
Date of Ratification Will Be
Determined By Central
Committeemen
There is talk in Pauahl street of the
possibility of a fusion of the so
called PInkham and McCandless-Wil-son
factions of the local Democratic
party. Those who claim to have the
party "dope" at their fingers' ends
say that such a state of affairs may
come to exist, and within a very short
time. Eut Which side will give way
should the purported fusion become a
fact, is not stated. No one seems to
be willing to tain on this question.
One well-informed Democrat, an ad
herent of the McCandless-WIlson fac
tion, said today there is a strong feel
ing in the party-thai all Bourbons
should get together Ittr the Coming pri
maries and boost the party candidates
for the house and senate. Irrespective
of the factions to which they may be
long. : - - ' : - - - r
, ''This is the opinion of every Demo
crat I have thus far talked to" he said.
"If the two factions would get togeth
er and exercise ft little common sense,
I believe they could hit upon a plan
of cooperation which would , be of in
valuable benefit to the party. And
such a cooperation would be -extreme
ly valuable in the coming primaries.
V The; territorial central committee
will meet. at 7:30 o clock tomorrow
evening id ibe office of NaUonal Com
mitteeman John H. Wilson In Pauahl
street,' at which time the party will be

the "primaries v Jt la expected that re
ports will be received cfrom those
members who expect to be candidates
for the house and senate. ,
Another matter of importance to be
taken up1 will be the setting of a date
for the-proposed ratification meeting,
probably to be held at Aala" park, at
which time the present national ad
ministration will be endorsed. Those
likely ti speak at the' meeting are L.'

AGONY OVER! RESIGNATION
OF JUDGE STUART CERTAIN!
Senator Shafroth Delivers to President Much-Desired Com

And There is No Doubt About Its Acceptance

WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 7,
Circuit Judge Thomas B. Stuart's
by department of justice officials for
hands. - '
It was taken to the White House this morning and delivered by Sena
tor Shafroth of Colorado, who has had possession of it since Judge Stuart
was here and wrote the "personal" letter to the president attacking Secre
tary Lane, Attomey-Generaf Gregory a nd Governor Pinkham.
Officials of the administration said today that the resignation would,
be immediately accepted.
C S. ALBERT.
The Associated Press in a despatch today also announces that the Stu
art resignation is in the president's hands and will be "accepted Immedi
ately."' Ever since Judge Stuart wrote the "personal" letter to the president,
publication of which in the Star-Bulletin showed the virulence of the Judge's
attack,' there has been no doubt that the resignation would be accepted
as soon as White House or department of justice officials could get hold of
it. For the past month It has been understood to be in possession of Sen
ator Shafroth of Colorado, who twice previously stopped similar letters
and returned them to Judge Stuart.
Indications recently have been that Attorney James L. Coke would be
appointed in Judge Stuart's place. Coke's resignation as territorial sena
tor is understood to have cleared the way for his appointment
