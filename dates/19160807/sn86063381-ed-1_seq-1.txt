Minneapolis, Aug. 7.A begin
ning upon what speakers said some
day may become a $25,000,000 pro
ject to redeem the millions of acres
of swamp land in Northern Minne
sota, was made at a meeting at the
University club late Saturday. It
was decided to raise $5,000 from
whatever sources possible, to make
an on-the-ground "reconoitre" of
northern swamp land This inspec
tion is to secure facts upon which
a request to the state legislature for
a much larger sum to pay for a com
prehensive topographical and soil
survey can be based. The fund was
given a start by a promise from Gov
ernor A A Burnquist that some
thing will be given from his con
tingent fund
By Development Men.
The meeting was at the invitation
of A Crocker, recently appointed
chairman of the committee on state
reclamation of the All Minnesota De
velopment association, which met in
June in St Paul Among those at
tending were Governor Burnquist,
Theodore Wold, governor of the Fed
eral Reserve bank, Dean Albert
Woods of the agricultural college of
the University of Minnesota, Samp
son Child and W Sardeson, for
merly professor in the geology de
partment of the University of Min
nesota now with the United States
geological survey.
Canal From Red Lake.
Mr Sardeson proposed that Red
lake, now a natural reservoir for the
northern country, should be connect
ed by a 100-mile canal with the
headwaters of the Minnesota river..
Red lake now -drains hy. seepage and
streams into the Red river. His plan
would mean that the lake waters that
now go into Hudson bay would be
converted to the Gulf of Mexico.
The millions of acres to the north,
east and south of Red lake can be
easily ditched and tiled by farmers
who settle them and the water turn
ed into Red lake, Mr. Sardeson said.
"Red lake can be drained to flow the
way it does now," he continued. "But
already the Red river has too much
water. At the Fargo state fair
grounds this year motor boats were
able to around the race track. Red
lake can be drained by ditches to
Rainy lake But this is open to the
big objection that it would mean the
flooding of land to the north and the
unredemption of a great area that
could be drained by a canal to the
"DOG" RUTLED6E VISITS

Rich Land to Be Reclaimed.
"This is best because it can surely
be done. It will cause no flooding.
It will save the water for Minnesota.
There are at least four good power
sites would be helped immensely by
the increased normal flow that the
scheme could insure.
"There are 1,250,000 acres of
state swamp land now good for noth
ing that the project would redeem.
There is an equal amount of United
States government land. There is
even more privately owned land and
corporation owned land. This land
is not red soil land, but black loam
wheat soil. Technically it is known
as 'Iowa land' Acres now quite
worthless when redeemed will come
to Red river valley valuations.
"The surface of Red lake under the
plan would be lowered 10 feet The
canal outlet would be dredged deeply
enough to carry a flow of several
feet.
Reservoirs for Flood Time.
"In order that the water might be
held back at flood time, for then the
Minnesota river valley has all and
often more than it can do to take
care of its own water, reservoirs will
have to be constructed along the
canal The reservoir water should be
left only when the Minnesota is at
its normal flow. The Red lake flow
would increase the normal Minnesota
river flow from one to two feet. This
increased flow also would be valuable
in reducing the possibility of flood.
The increased normal flow would
wear a larger river bed. When flood
time came and the Red lake flow was
hefrd~back, the Minnesota river "wouHf
"be ableTd care lor "a, great amount
of water."
To Cost $25,000,000.
The building of the canal, Mr. Sar
deson said, would cost $25,000,000.
This is an engineer's estimate on in
formation of the topography and
geology of the state furnished by Mr.
Sardeson.
The need of an accurate'survey of
the whole affected district may be
realized, Mr. Sardeson pointed out,
when it is considered that the last
session of the legislature, a commit
tee spent much time and some money
in discussing a drainage canal from
Red lake to the headwaters of the
Mississippi. This canal water would
have to flow uphill, he said. The
headwaters of the Minnesota are 200
feet below Red lake.
