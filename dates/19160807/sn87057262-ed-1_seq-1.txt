NEW YORK, Aug. 7.—Belief
among city officials, street car heads
and labor officials that the street

tered a certainty late this forenoon.
Police officials were so -confident
the agreement reached between union

could expect to resume interrupted

This forenoon only 655 out of the

Big Cable Deal Closed
By the United Press
This deal which establishes the first comprehensive news service betwen the two conti

Mitre, publisher of La Nacion. Charles P. Stewart, formerly general European manager of
the United Press, will be in general charge of the South American service.
It is believed here that the closing of these contracts marks anew epoch in the develop
ment of social and commercial relations between North and South America. Heretofore,
the principal newspapers of South America have received their foreign news from European
agencies. The United Press now will cover the world for South American papers. On ac
count of cable transmission conditions, much of the service will be filed direct from the Lon
