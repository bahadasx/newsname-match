Girls' Gingham and Percale
Dresses Under Price
"I always find the prettiest aud most girlish styles in your store," said a mother the other day, and these are just such
dresses. That they are offered at reductions merely means we are desirous of a clearance. Excellent giughams and per
tales in plaids, checks aud plain colors, neatly trimmed and well made. Sizes 6 to 16.
We could not possibly buy these dresses at wholesale for the price at which we offer them. But the insistent cry for
' something new'' compels us t close out the stock now so we can have an entirely now assortment for the coming season.
Mothers lose a splendid bargain opportunity who fail to see these attractive little frocks.
