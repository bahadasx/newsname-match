Detroit Workers by Repub
lican Presidential Nominee
Detroit, Aug. 7. Republican Nom
inee Hughes' first appeal for votes
on his campaign for the presidency
was a plea for Americanism, expres
sion of a hope of a get-together spirit
of cooperation between capital and
labor, and Indorsement of a national
movement for , welfare of American
workers,
The nominee spoke the first of his
campaign talks In a stirilngly close
room at the Hotel Pont Cbartraln, to
committee representing welfare
workers of every factory In Detroit.
There were more than a hundred per
sons who crowded In and . mopped
their facea In the blistering heat be
tween handclaps for tfce nominee. It
was quite a demonstration, consider
ing the heat, and It followed a real
ly unusual outpouring of the public
early In the morning to greet, the
Q. O. P. aspirant fox-Dresldential hon
ors as he passed through the streets
in an automobile.
Democracy cannot stand strife be
tween capital and labor. Hughes told
the welfare workers.
"We are not laborers or capitalists"
he continued. "We are all American
cltUena." ,
Tho welfare workers were Introduc
ed to Hughes by J. M. Eaton, of the
Cadillac Motor company. He explain
ed how the big manufacturers In De
troit had organized branches for free
medical attention to their employes,
free legal advice and had planned
recreation places, and nourishing
meals for them.
"Detroit takes the lead In a great
many things, but there Is nothing In
which Its advance is more Important
than in this welfare work," said
Hughes, In responding. "There is
nothing in which I personally take
a greater Interest than this. The
United States was not founded for
production It was founded to equal
opportunity to all for life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. It Is an
awful mistake to think of the man
through whose work the production
Is made possible as a mere unit of

British Failure to Threaten
Berlin, and Roiinaaia'sin
diference to Allied Diplo

Berlin, Aug. 7. Failure of the
British to make any Important head
way In tbelr great offensive on the
Somme front, and a fresh defeat for
allied diplomats in Ronmanla, have
Inspired the German public with con-
fldence.
(Reports from Bucharest and Vienna
indicate the Balkan Situation is
again satisfactory to the central
powers. Reports from Stockholm
declare keen disappointment is felt
in Petrograd over the failure of the
allied diplomats' latest maneuvers at
Bucharest
Satisfied that they could not In
duce Roumanla to enter the war, the
allies attempted another coup In the
negotiations Just closed. They ask
ed that Russia be permitted to send
troops through "Roumanla to invade
Hungary, thus evading the Carpath
ian manntaln barrier. Rossis, guar
anteed to defend Roumanla from at
tack should Austria declare war on
Roumanla.
Halting of the Russian advance In
the southeast and the allies' failure
to break through the German lines
In the west, were factors that aided
Germany greatly at Bucharest.
The allies have practically dis
continued their efforts to win Rou
manian favor. !

Salt Lake City, Aug. 7. With 10
cent bread an "issue, the 19th annual
convention of the National Associa
tion of Master Bakers opened here
today. About 1S00 bakers from all
corners of the country were In' at
tendance. , All past presidents of the
organisation met in executive session
this afternoon.' A "get-acquainted"
reception will be held tonight.
Chicago Aug. 7. - Prospects , of
a general increase in the price of
bread throughout the country were
considered today by the Chicago
bakers. j
Startling advance in' the price of
flour is responsible. This followed
sensational advances In the wheat
market due to black rust and storm
snd heat damage throughout the
northwest.
"Flour has advanced $1.50 a bar
rel in the last month," said J. W.
Eckhart, president of the Eckhart
Milling company, here today. "It is
now selling for $6.25 against $4.75
a month ago. If there is no change
in the wheat situation soon, it will
go a dollar higher." '
Minneapolis, Aug. 7. -With flour
advancing 70 cents a barrel during
last week, the price of bread was In
grave danger of soaring, local bak
ers declared today. Flour sells at
$6.75 a barrel today as compared
with $6.05 a week ago. The Increase
in the price of wheat during the
past seven days Is responsible for the
rise. While there was no advance
in the price of grain today, the hlKh
mark of $1.41 a bushel for September
wheat was maintained. Last week
the grain sold for $1.27.
With every cent advance In wheat
flour Increases five cents a barrel.
It wheat climbs higher, bakers will
ether Increase the cost of the or
dinary 12-ounce loaf, or make small
er loaves they announced.
