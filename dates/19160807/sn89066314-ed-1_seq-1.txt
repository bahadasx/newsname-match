THE DAILY MISSOURIAN
EIGHTH YEAR
COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, MONDAY, AUGUST 7, 1916
NUMBER 291
CITY WOULD SUFFER
IF TRAINMEN STRIKE
Tie-Up of Railroads Means
the Cut off of Columbia's
Food Sources.
MEAT SUPPLY LARGE
However, People Would Be
Forced to Live on Flour,
Meal and Pork.
If the 400,000 railroad men now
threatening to strike are unable to
make satisfactorj arrangements, with
the railroad olhcials. and walk out,
it will hae a seiious effect on the
people and business interests of Co
lumbia Some of the possibilities if
such a strike does take place aie told
below bj some of Columbia's leading
business men
J X Belcher or tne Heicncr uro
cerv Company sajs that virtuallj all
the products consumed in Columbia
are shipped in "Out of everj 100
bushels of potatoes consumed in this
citj , 99 are shipped in." he said "The
.same thing applies to cabbages What
we had enough of last jear. like fruit,
has this vear been burned while still
on the trees, so this jear even these
products hae to bo shipped in
"But let me tell ou. If this strike
comes on Columbia is going to lini
out In what a fix- it is It'll be uor-e
than most people imagine.
Perhaps we might be able to gath
er enough coal around the place to
run the water and light plant and
Hetzler's slaughter house That would
allow Columbians to eat flour, meal
and pork, because thev are the onlv
things that we hate in large quanti
ties and are independent cf from out
side I do wih the strike is settled
"I suppose there will be a few trains
that will run but thev will not be able
in any appreciable measure to supply
the demand."
J. P Hetzler. of HctIer Brothers,
said that Columbia could hae enough
meat to last for some time "it depends
he said, "on how long the strike lasts
whether it will be serious for us so
far as the suppl of meat counts The
supplj is large enough, I think, to last
as long as the strike lasts, no matter
how long, because we could bring in
much live stock from the surrounding
country However, the people would
not get much variety
The manager of the Hamilton-Brown
Shoe Factor explained that most of
the raw material comes from the out
side and that large supplies of shoes
are shipped out
"With these two stopped," he ques
tioned, "what are we going to do? We
cannot work without tools, and there is
no use manufacturing if there is no
way of getting the shoes out of the
city. Whj should we manufacture? The
onlj thing that can be done is to shut
up the factory during the strike, and
that is a calamltv to the workers and
ourselves that I should like to steer
away fom "
Mr P.ivne of the Pavne-Roth Gro
cerv believes that only enough coal
could be gathered to last through the
summer. "You would be surprised,
he said. " to see how dependent the
city water and light plant and Hetz
ler's are on the outside for their sup
ply of coal. If the strike lasted through
the winter we could not stand it at
all" Mr. Pajne also explained, as
did Mr Belcher, to what a sreat ex
tent Columbia is dependent on the out
side for their supplies.

President's First Political Speech
Probablj at St. I.ouN.
Mr United Press.
WASHINGTON', Aug 7. The choice
of speakers and speaking dates for
the Democratic oratorical campaign
was discussed today by President
Wilson, Chairman Vance McCormick
and vice-chairman Cummings of the
campaign committee.
Plans for the President's personal
speaking trips are held up by doubt
as to the date of adjournment of Con
gress It Is probable, however, that
the first extended trip he will make
to discuss politics will be to St. Louis
the latter part of September.
The Browns' sluggers were on their
job jesterday at Centralia, and the
Braves were forced to take the short
end of a 7 to 4 score. Mason and
Winegar were the leaders in the at
tack, securing more than half of the
team's hits and driving in fie of the
seven runs.
Mason's double with three men on
in the eighth was really the deciding
factor, though Wmegar's four-base-hit
to deep center gave the Browns a
two-run lead right' at the jump Cen
tralia tied it up in the fifth when two
hits, an error and a sacrifice account
ed for two scores.
With one down in the eighth, Ligon
strolled but was forced at second by
Foster Winegar hit and took second
on the play on Foster at third. Dip
pold was purposelj passed, filling the
bases, but Mason's hard hit ball be
tween left and center sent all three
men across the plate. Mason scored
from second on a single by Rutledge.
Centralia came back gamely in their
half of the same inning and when Rut-
ledge let Evans' hit get past him with
Klugman on first, both men made the
circuit Just to make it sure, the
Browns put another across in the
ninth on a hit bj Davis, a walk, an
error and a sacrifice. The Braves did
nothing in their half.
Here is the box score:
