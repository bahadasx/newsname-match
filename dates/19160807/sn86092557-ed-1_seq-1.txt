IDE
People Feared Big Mine Dis
aster Had Oc
curred.
When a car load of powder belong
ing to tho Four States Coal company
at Annabelle let go at ten minutes to
-three o'clock this morning, Artie;
Woods was painfully lujured. several
-others cut by flying glass and doors
and windows in every house in Anna
belle torn out, besides a hole being
-made in the ground inuu which would
Tit a six room house. |
The powder was in the Four States
company's magazine which had just I
been filled two days before. The
; powder was carefully put away at tho
time and no detail loft undone which]
Is neceHsary to mako explosives safe.
SJ The cause of the detonation which1
was felt till ovor the county Is un
known. As soon as the village was
awakened fears were folt lor the |
' mine, as the motor which runs the i
"fan had been In tho process of repair
for the past five days and all figured
the mine had beon wrecked by gas ex
plosion.
. The detonation was felt in Fair
mont, having rocked tho city hall and .
awakening many from their slumber.;
Many who heard the noise at first
thought it was thunder but when told j
of the explosion this morning wore
certain that It was the Annabelle
^racket which had awakoned them.
The terrific report was hoard at Man
nington, Shlnnston and out of the way
places in Mannington district as well
as small hamlets along tho Marlon
county border In Harrison county.
Farmers for miles around hearing
the noise hitched up their horses and
those who have autos boarded them
and went immediately to the appar
ent source of the explosion thinking a
^repetition of the Monongah disaster
i of 1908 was at hand. But the mine
-was found in perfect shape, even tho j
violence Qt ijio powdor magazino ex
plosion failing to injure tho machin
ery.
Th<? nearest house to tho magazino,
the compressor building which is
nearly three quarters of a mile away,
had the roof blown off and the doors
and windows sent flying through the
tfair.
Behind one of the doors was Artio
Woods, who was oiling the compress
or. The door struck him, knocking him
down and breaking two ribs on the
right side. He was brought to Fair
mont Hospital No. 3 on the 5 o'clock
Clarksburg car this morning and is
reported at that institution as being
but slightly injured other than the
fractured ribs. He will live, being
onsciouft at all times.
Others at Annabelle wore the vic
tims of pieces of glass which had for
merly been the lights in the windows
of their houses. Several houseB were
cracked and many of them shaken so
badly that china and glassware and
other breakable objects wero smashed.
The amount of damage has not yet
been estimated by tlib officials of the
company. An investigation is in
/progress concerning the manner in
which the powder was packed away,
but it is thought there will bo nothing
develop as those who were In charge i
of laying up the powder when it was
taken from the railway car have al
ready, claimed that there could havo
been no accident from the manner in
which is was packed. This statement
has not howevor been given out of
,'ficlaily. Some flzur". that Uchting
may have set the place afire and that
explosion resulted.
- Hundreds of people from the reg
ions surrounding Annabelle made the
;trip on "Tho Goat" this morning to
the mine to get a glimpse of the dam
age done. They looked in awe at tho
hole made in the ground, at the hun
dreds of windowless and doorless
houses which arc the abodos of tho
joiners and other employes of the
Four Stat-s company. The auxiliary
powder magazine, the houso in which
is stored the powder brought daily
from the main magazine for the use
of miners was unharmed. This houso
?lip considerable distance from the
larger magazine.

Not Connected With Pitts
burgh and Brownsville
Packet Plans.
Tlnro is p-ospect of an early res*
toration of regular packet traffic on
tl'e Monongahela up to this point
without anything being done about it
locally. The Wheeling Telegraph of
Saturday printed the following:
There will be more boats oper
ating In the Ohio river between
Pittsburgh and down river points
next summer than ever In the his
tory of the Ohio river.
There is a possibility of a new
packet line operating in the Pitts
burgh-Fairmont trade in the near
future.
Captain H. C. Donnelly, one- of
thn owners of the Ohio and r.a
nIwTik- -Tfan'sportation company,
yesterday stated he was investi
gating the possibilities of this now
venture and is awaiting word
from his partner, Captain Fred
Hornbrook, .who is now at Point
Pleasant. It is likely the steam
er Ruth will be placjd in that
trade because it is adapted for
the upper river.
A trial trip will be made with
in a few weeks. Fairmojt, Mo$
gantown, Brownsville and other
cities will benefit by this new
venture.
This is a venture distinct from the
Pittsburgh and Brownsville Packet
company, which recently secured a
charter from the state of Pennsyl
vania to operate a packet line be
tween Pittsburgh and Brownsville.
The incorporators of that concern are
Orville Noll, ? .?? ? gave his address as
the office of the Pittsburgh and Cin

These gentlemen said when they
appeared before the Pennsylvania
Public Fervice Commission that If the
business paid they would extend the
line to Morgantown and it was sug
gested at the time that they might bo
Induced to come a little further and
run thoir boats to Fairmont.

CUMBERLAND, Md., Aug. 7.?It
was stated officially here that Cum

of tho Kelley-Sprlngfleld Tire Com
pany to locate a rubber tire plant here
as outlined to the Cumberland Cham
ber of Commerce committeo and a
committee of local bankers at the of
fices of R. P. Goldschmidt & Co.,
bankers, New York.
In substance, the proposal of the
KeHey-Springfield" people will be that
Cumberland build and equip the plant.
This would cost $1,500,000, a sum in
excess of the reserve of the Cumber
land banks by $300,000. This would
close tho banks and tie up the city
financially. It is thought the propo
sition will be met by .a counter prop
osition, and that the people here will
adhere to their original offer of $250.

the committee state that should the
people agree to the demand of the

Marion County's
Choice tor the
Supreme Court
HON. WINFIELD S. MEREDITH
HAS SERVED FAITHFULLY IN
MANY CAPACITIES..
The selection of Hon. Winfield Scott
Meredith by the Marion county Repub
licans Saturday as the logical candi
date for the office of Judge of Su
preme Court of Appeals of West Vir
ginia, is only a slight measure of tho
esteem and appreciation that Mariou
county Republicans have for this emi
nent local attorney. Mr. Meredith is
a friendly plain spoken man who is
known to everyone in the county, ana
delights to call himself "only an at
torney engaged in the practice of law."
While Mr. Meredith may be only an
attorney, yet he is one of f.ho busiest
of the attorneys in this section (if the
state and there are few Important
cases that are heard in any of the
courts in which he is not one of the
counsel engaged in the matter.
Born in Marion county, August 1855,
Mr. Meredith has been a lifelong res
ident of the county and for mqfe than
30 years has been engaged in tho
practipe of his profession, Doth his
fathor and grandfather-wero citizens
of this county when it was still a part
of Virginia. Educated in the public
schools of Marlon county and tho
Fairmont Stato Normal school, Mr.
Meredith taught in the Normal school
and read law under James A. Mor
row, of Fairmont who was one of tho
leading lawyers of the new state. Af
ter being admitted to tho bar young
Meredith served as Marior. county's
prosecuting attorney for two terms.
During this time he was still con
nected with educational work and for
many years was one of the trustees
or the Fairmont Normal school serv
ing with J. E. Sands and J. H. L'rowu
field. President ot Fairmout district
board of education for three terms,
Mr. Meredith has always been ill!cr
ested in the schools of the state.
While engaged in the practice of
law Mr. Meredith has frequently boon
asked to preside in the courts of Mar
ion, Monongalia and Harrison county.
Although not a politician Judge Mere
dith has always been a strong Repub
lican supporter and has representee
this county in the state senate for ofui
years. During that time he served a3
chairman of the committee on judic
iary affairs and was also the chairman
of the Republican caucus. Other
members of tho senate at the time
Mr. Meredith was a member wore
Howard Sutherland, H. D. Hatfield, E.
T. England and Fred 0. Blue. All of
these men are well known Republi
cans and all arc now holding promi
nent state offices.
Only once has Jud^e Meredith been
defeated for a public office. This was
when he and Judge A. G. Dayton were
both cc/.ididateB for the Republican
nomination for Congress. Judge Mer
edith withdrew at the Terra Alta con
vention In favor of Dayton when a
deadlock threatened because of his
strong support from this section of
tho state.
