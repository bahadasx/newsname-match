KANSANS COMING
BY RAIL AND GAS
TO HEARHUGHES
Special Trains Will Bring
Thousands to Topeka.
Platform Speeches in Four
Other Towns in State.
MRS. HUGHES WITH HIM
But She Prefers to Stay at Hotel
While Here.
Republican Nominee Here Sat
urday, September 2.
Kansas will entertain Mrs. Charles
Evans Hughes when Judge Hughes
comes to this state September 2. Offi
cial announcement was today sent to
Kansas to the effect that the Repub
lican presidential nominee will be ac
companied by his wife on his west
ern trip. It was also intimated that
several Kansas towns may draw rear
platform speeches when the Hughes
train comes to this state.
Through arrangements announced
today it is probable Judge Hughes will
make a short speech at Salina. He
may also make rear platform talks at
Abilene, Junction City, Manhattan and
Lawrencev Governor Capper has wired
Chairman Willcox asking several short
speeches in the state and it is almost
certain that the presidential nominee
will consent to talk in Salina and sev
eral other towns.
One Hour Here.
The stay in Topeka will be one hour.
Judge Hughes and his party of thirty-two
persons will arrive over the
Union Pacific at 3:47 the afternoon of
Saturday, September 2. The party
will leave for Kansas City on a pecial
train over the Union Pacific at 4:60.
Interest surrounding the visit of
Mrs. Hughes, however, has been
dampened by the announcement that
neither Judge Hughes nor Mrs.
Hughes desire special entertainment
in private homes. ' Mrs. Hughes de
sires to be taken to a hotel during the
Topeka meeting. The presidential
nominee has also asked that he may
be- taken to a hotel following - his
speech that he-may change linen"be
fore his train leaves for Kansas City.
Only Regular Stop..
The Topeka meeting will be the only
regular stop on the Hughes schedule
th-rough Kansas. Neither at Salina nor
other points will Judge Hughes leave
the train.
It is the plan of Charles Sessions,
provisional chairman of the Repub
lican state committee, to make the
Topeka meeting the feature event of
the campaign in Kansas. Several
special trains may bring the out of
town crowd to Topeka, while hundreds
of people will come to the meeting
in motor cars. The fact that a Satur
day date has been secured is expected
to greatly increase the attendance at
the meeting and it is believed that a
record crowd will hear Judge Hughes
message to Kansas.
The presidential nominee will come
to Topeka from Denver, where he
speaks Friday, September 1. Follow
ing his speech in Topeka, he will go to
Kansas Citv for a night meeting.

Two Submarines Sighted Off
Maine Coast.
At Signal From British Light
house It Disappears.
Machias Port, Me., Aug. 7. Captain
Small o fthe Cross Island coast guard
station reported this morning that hia
station had sighted a large submarine
bound west. Its nationality could not
be determined but the captain said he
had no doubt taht it was an undersea j
craft. I
The submarine was coming to the j
surfrace when it was sighted and after !
running awash fifteen minutes, again I
submerged. It was thought that the !
vessel might be the German subma- (
nne Bremen, so lar as can oe learn
ed there are no United States subma
rines on the Maine coast.
The lookout who saw the submarine
later said that he sighted it up in
clear weather five miles to the south
east. As the vessel came to the sur-
I itic-t- ttie iuokoui Ha la ne neara several
Diasts irom the signal horn at the
light house on Seal Island, a British
possession. It is believed that the
keepr of the light house was signalling
to the keeper at Grand Manan light,
also British owned, that a submarine
had been sighted. Immediately after
the whistle sounded the submarine
fubmerged. A few moments later a
haze set In and it was impossible to
see more than four miles off Cross
Island.
Sees Second Submarine.
Machias Port, Me., Aug. 7. Lowell
W. Dunn, the outlook on Cross Inland,
later reported that he had sighted a
second submarine considerably small
er than the first one.
No V. S. Plunger There.
Washington, Aug. 7. Navy officers
said today no American submarines
were known to be anywhere in the
vicinity of Cross Island.

He was driven Immediately to the i

DOG AND CAT REFUGE
HAS REAL AMBULANCE
Cleveland, O., Aug. 7. Crippled
and senile cats and does will soon
have a home here. The Cleveland
Animal Protective association, hav
ing just raised $5,000, is spending
it for a home for domestic animal
waifs. There will be a hospital, an
ambulance to chase after cat and
dog victims, and an electric chair
to end the miseries of the incur
able. The hospital will be kept
open night and day.
GAS TO J5 CENTS
Minimum of One Dollar Will Be
Charged In Topeka.
Federal Court Receirer An
nounces Jfew Price.
Thirty-five cents per thousand feet
and a minimum of $1 per month.
That is what gas bills in Topeka will
show henceforth. Robert Stone, at
torney for Kansas Natural Gas com
pany, has received word to that effect
from John M. Landon, receiver ap
pointed by the federal court for the
Kansas Natural.
The Kansas public utilities commis
sion allowed the gas company to in-
FATHER
crease the price of gas from 25 cents
per thousand to 28 cents per thousand,
but that was not sufficient and the
gas company worked its way out of
the hand of the commission and Into
the federal court. Landon is the fed
eral receiver. The price now jumps
from 28 cents to 35 cents per thou
sand. Under the court order this price
may not be permanent but it is likely
to be. Landon recently put up a bond
of J750.000 guaranteeing that if upon
the final henring of the gas case the
court should hold that the proposed
price was too high the consumers
should be paid back the difference be
tween the price charged and the price
fixed by the court.
It was known and so stated at the
time the bond was filed that the price
of gas would be increased but the ex
act increase was not made known un
til Receiver Landon announced it. The
new rate becomes effective with the
September gas bills.
The rate fixed for Atchison is 5
cents hifcher than the Topeka rate, or
40 cents per thousand. St. Joseph has
been paying 40 cents for some time
and the probabilities are its rate will
go to 45 cents per thousand.
SMILE AND GOAT 0' TAN
That Was Battling Costume of Chicago
Women; PoUce Act.
Chicago, Aug. 7. A bevy of joyous
young women, clad in a coat of tan
and a smile apiece, burst inu- the early
morning air today and jumped into the
lake along the north shore, establish
ing the limit for nudity among women
bathers.
Police Chief Healy, already surfeit
ed with reports of women bathing clad
only in kimonos, scanty trunks or
water wings, announced the limit had
been reached.
His orders to patrolmen were:
"Bring 'em in and if they haven't
got anything on to wear to the station,
that's their affair."
Venus arising out of the sea would
have looked tame beside the young
goddesses, north shore residents re
ported. About nine-tenths of Chi
cago's population set their alarm
clocks for 4 a. m. tomorrow and beach
cars promised to be crowded.

Detroit, Mich., Aug. 7. Charles
Evans Hughes arrived in Detroit early
today on the first lap of his trans
continental tour amid the reverbera
tion of bombs, the blare of bands and
vigorous handclapping on the part of
a few hundred people assembled, at
the Michigan Central depot. The spe
cial train bearing the Republican
nominee and party was about twenty
minutes late into Detroit.
Although there were but few out
bursts ot cheering along the line of
the parade to the Hotel Pontchartrain,
the demonstration was remarkable in
the size of the crowd that lined the
route of the procession. The candi
date, seated in an automobile with
Mrs. Hughes, rode from station to
hotel with hat in hand, smilingly ac
knowledging the greetings from the
crowds.
Will Lambast Wifeon.
Hughes' two addresses tonight will
be the first stump speeches of the ac
tual campaign. Shortcomings of the
Democratic administration it was
learned today, will be the big theme
of these addresses. The governor is
expected to concentrate his attack on
the president's Mexican policy, but in
addition will touch upon the tarinT and
foreign relations, enlarging and ex
panding his address of acceptance of
the nomination.
Formation of a Republican ad
visory committee which, with Chair
man Willcox will be in direct charge
of the Republican campaign, will be
announced within a few days, it was
learned. The committee will be en
tirely separate and distinct from the
Republican national committee and
form the campaign committee recent
ly formed. The advisory committee
will consist of from five to nine mem
bers and three of the places already
have been tentatively assigned.
To Select Vice Chairman, Too.
The men already selected are Wil
liam Locb, former secretary to Colo
nel Roosevelt; George B. Cortelyou,
also a former eecretary to the colonel
and Charles D. Hilles, formerly Wil
liam Howard Taft's secretary. The
complete personnel of the committee
will be announced within a few days
Hughes is taking a very personal in
terest in the matter of the selection of
a vice chairman of the national com
mittee, to be in charge of the west
ern headquarters at Chicago, and it is
likely that he will confer with Chair
man Willcox and other leaders on this
subject in Chicago. No announce
ment of the candidate's own prefer
ence for this job has been forthcom
ing, but it is said that A. T. Hurt of
Kentucky is being seriously considered.

HUGHES PLEADS
WORKERS' CAUSE
TO EMPLOYERS
Addresses Detroit Manufactur
ers Who Hire 100,000 Men. -
Praises Them for Interest
Shown in Human Welfare.
SPEECH TO WOMEN ALSO
Declares He Decided Women
Should Vote, Long Ago.
Factories Must Be Equipped
With Safety Appliances.
Detroit, Aug. 7. Charles E. Hughes,
speaking today to forty manufacturer
of Detroit and vicinity, employing
100,000 men, congratulated them upon
what they had done for the welfare
of their employee, told them that the
democracy of the United States would
not stand for a continuation of this
alleged strife between capital and la
bor and declared the American work
men should not be regarded as a mere
economic unit but as a fellow worker,
a human being.
Mr. Hughes's address was Im
promptu and followed a brief speech
by J. M. Eaton, spokesman for the
manufacturers who outlined the wel
fare measures for employes taken by
industrial concerns here and suggest
that the nominee endorse a move
ment looking to the formation of a
national welfare assoc itlon of manu
facturers. Mr. Hughes saiil he regard
ed the suggestion "very favorably." .
A few minutes later Mr. Hughe
spoke to a group of suffragists. The
day was hot and the air of the little
room where he received the manufac
turers and the suffragettes was almost
stifling. The nominee spoke with hia
wife standing behind him.
Formed Stiff Oplnon Long Ago.
Mr. Huphea reiterated in his address
to the suffragists his declaration in
New Tork that the suffragist question
should be settled speedily by giving
the vote to women all over the coun
try. He added that he had formed
this opinion long ago, before he
thought that the time would ever
come when he would have to announce
his position publicly. In hia address
to the manufacturers, Hr. Hughes ajd
'Utue -wtu, miatak . to. think, a
the men through whose activity pro-
uucuon in possime a -mere economte
units. -They are .human beings. We
are all worklnsr men Jn thf nmtntrv
We are In different spheres of activ
ity but we ought to have a venae of
co-operation so that every man takes
pride in what he is doing and In doing
it n .Ho ) V. i V.H I . .. w. .
he Is working alongside of every other
man for the mnH nf tha mimtw
in jui nciinie wurit yuu are
buttressing democracy. The human
factor is, after all, the important
factor. You may develop your physic
cal plants, your physical instrumental
ities, distribution and everything that
goes to make up the material aide rf
prosperity but you are absolutely
hopeless without the human factor
and in America, the land of free men,
the man who is at work for a living
must feel that the country Is doing
the right thing by him. He is entitled
to be safe In his work to have every
precaution taken against every sort
of accident that can be prevented.
You Must Protect Workmen.
"A man is put at work. How can
he refuse the job which stands be
tween him and starvation? It is per
fectly idle to say in our Industrial
conditions, that he can take or refuse
the work according to his idea of
tho safety appliances which may be
provided to protect him. Tou have
got to pcotect him. No man can work
in any position where his life, his limb
or his health are subject to any un
necessary risk. That is good Ameri
canism and that is good business.
"We arc not materialists in this
country: we are all Idealists but the
one thing that appeals to the worklrar
man Is the idea that he in encal to
some job In a first class way. That Is
what makes him proud: that is what
makes him satisfied: and when you
consider our great industrial manu
factures and the enormous extension
of our industrial markets, the hop
that In all this there will be right,
through It the spirit of human broth
erhood, of fellowship and of co-operation
Is established so that managers
and working men will feel that they
are engaged in a common cause.
"And we will get through with this
old strife between labcr and capital.
Democracy cannot stand it. We are
not laborers and capitalists in this
country. We are fellow citizens.
"That is what I stand for, end
therefore, because you enrich our
citizenship because you build perma
nent the foundation of our society."
I greet you and I wish you the best
success in vour work."
