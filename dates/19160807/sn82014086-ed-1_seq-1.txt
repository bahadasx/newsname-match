$102,000,000 SUIT AGAINST FORMER
NEW HAVEN ROAD DIRECTORS
Will Bo Decided by the Full Bench of
Massachusetts Supreme Court.
Boston, Aug. 6 The full bench of
the state supreme court will be called
upon to determine the merits of the
suit for recovery of $102,000,000 from
former directors of the New York, New
Haven & Hartford railroad for al
leged improper expenditures between
llt-04 and 1909. Judge Crosby, it was
announced yesterday, has referred
back to the full bench the bill, answer
demurrers and special pleadings in the
suit, which was brought by trustees of
the will of Olea Bull Vaughn and oth
er minority stockholders of the road.
The plaintiffs conti.nd that the
directors made vast expenditures un
wisely and without authority in the
purchase of steam and electric rail
way lines and steamship enterprises
in an effort to effect a monopoly of
transportation in New England.
The suit was before the ffull court
two years ago when it was decided" the
minority stockholders could not main
tain the bill until it was shown that
the present directors had refused to
briru; proceeding against their pred
ecessors. Since then the plaintiffs by
various amended declarations and pro
cesses claim they have overcome the
obstacles pointed out by the court, and
are now entitled to tfo forward because
of the hostile attitude of the present
board of directors. The corporation
and individual defendants have ans
wered by contention that the plaintiffs
are still without right to proceed.

Captain Believes That One of the Sub
mersibles Was Hit by One of the
Shots Fired Three Americans on
Board.
New York, August 6 The Italian
steamship Re-d'Italia with three
American passengers on board from
Genoa, Italy, was chased for seven
hours by three submarines while in
the Mediterranean and was saved
from capture cr destruction by use of
defense guns mounted art, according
to the report of her master, Captain
Amedo Pinceti, of the arrival of the
ship here today. The captain said he
believed one of the submersibles was
hit by one of the shots rlred, although
his only evidence was the appearance
of the column of water which rose in
the air where the shell fell.
No Shots Fired by Submarines.
No shots were fired at the Re
d'Italia Captain Pinceti said. The
submarines were discovered by the
lookout at 9.80 a. m. on July 23 when
the vessel was about 200 miles from
Genoa, midway between the Balearic
islands and the Island of Corsica. They
were then one and one-half miles
dead astern. Captain Pinceti ordered
the speed of his ship increased to her
full capacity about 12 knots an hour.
Then he summoned the crew of naval
gunners on board and took personal
command of them.
"About 9.45 the submarines were
slightly abeam on the starboard quar
ter, traveling In a line," Captain pin
ceti said.
Ordered Gunners to Open Fire.
"See'ng that they were chasing us,
I ordered the gunners to or.n fire.
The Mrd shell, I believe took feet as
the spout of water that followed the
falling of the shell was much different
from that caused by the preceding
shots. It was much heavier and ap
parently impregnated with smoke or
oil. At any rate, from that time on
only two periscopes were to be seen.
; Fired Fifteen Shots.
"The chase continued until 4:30 that
afternoon, 'the heats not getting any
