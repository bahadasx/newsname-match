PLATQOH IS PROTECTED
Particular Pains Taken to Look After
Some of the Boys at
Black Point
(Special Correspondence of the Star)
Black Point, Aug. 5. Yours truly
has been very busy of late "digging up
"soiled" dirt and hauling and putting
in "clean'1 sand. I'm with the "bunch"
who stay in the only wooden bunga
low at Black Point the guard house.
The platoon stationed here is allowed
considerable more protection than the
"ordinary" soldier in fact, we have
a bodyguard twenty-four hours a day.
Last night as all the boys were
preparing for supper, quite a few who
are more gifted than the others begun
to scent from far away Oxford smoke
from the barbecue pit and decided to
make a change for a day in rations,
leaving on the night train for a day's
outing. Here's hoping they find it
worth the price.
The boys who are afforded "special"
protection are busy beautifying the
camp grounds. They are clearing out
all underbrush along the river front.
We extend to all volunteers a hearty
welcome.
All. the boys are wearing a smile
that will not wither until the night
after pay day, which we think will be
Monday.-
"Doc" Melin is sure making the
boys cultivate a taste for "spuds,"
serving them "nude" for breakfast,
and with "jackets" on for supper.-
The rirst Jiattaion went out mis
morning on an eight-mile hike. AH
the men arc now equipped and put up
a regular appearance as mcjr hioivh
out with full packs. The Third Bat
talion also hiked out, going north,
while the First went east,.
"Fat" Davis is to be commended
for making the highest score on the
range with the pistol. . ,
The soldiers are now enjoying the
evenings at the "movies." A picture
fihow has been opened in the pavilion.
The pictures taken of. the regiment
were shown here two nights this
week. They were very good.

Six Weeks of Infantile Paralysis and
the Disease is Steadily
Spreading
(Associated Press)
New York, Aug. -7. The infantile
paralysis ' epidemic, . which today en
tered its sixth week, showed no abate
ment. In the twenty-four hours end
ing this morning at ten o'clock, forty
four deaths in the five boroughs of
New York and 145 new cases were re
ported. .
But the Delegates to this Morning's
Meeting Seemed to Have Been
Misinformed About Bonds
. Between 200 and 300 citizens at
tended the good roads convention here
this morning. The circuit court room
was crowded, many standing or sit
ting in the windows. The delegates
from the various . precincts having
been seated, an expression of senti
ment from each precinct was asked
for, and when it was seen that the
sentiment was going against bond
ing the county at this time, a resolu
tion was offered by Col. R. F. Rogers,
instructing the county commissioners
not to call the proposed election,
which resolution was adopted unani
mously. ' . ,
It was evident from the talks made
that there was a general misunder
standing of the bond issue as it was
proposed. The large attendance show
ed interest, and certainly there was
no expression against good roads. A
wide difference of - opinion on ' good
roads, their construction, and the
financing of them, was evident,
i Mr. A. R. Griffin of Citra, was elect
ed chairman of the convention, and
Mr, O. H. Rogers of Lynne, secretary.
Nearly every precinct in the county
was -represented. In several precincts
no delegates had; been . chosen," and
citizens from these precincts were al
lowed seats as delegates. ;
Mr. W. D. Carn, speaking for the
Ocala delegates, stated that the senti
ment of 'the city was greatly divided,
but he thought that a majority fav
ored a bond issue. The Ocala' delega
tion was not instructed. Mr. Carn ex
plained that the ; county was now
spending $70,000 for the up-keep of
the present road system and for in
debtedness, and he pointed out that
in thirty years that would amount to
$2,100,000. He did not see how it
would be possible to spend less than
the present system. A bond issue he
believed would give the county a per
manent and economical - system of
roads, provide for their maintenance,
and .for the maintenance of other
roads in the county, without an in
crease in taxes. He said that the
boards of county commissioners, upon
which had sat some of the most prom
inent men in the county, had failed to
accomplish anything under "the pres
ent system of building and maintain
ing the roads.. He said that next year
it would he necessary to spend about
$46,000 on up-keep alone, without
building any additional , mileage of
hard roads.
Mr. M. L. Payne, of Fairfield, made
a vigorous speech against the propos
ed bond issue. He said his precinct
had voted 5 to 1 against the issue. He
contended that the bond issue would
increase taxes m spite of the conten
tion of those promoting the issue, and
took exception to the contention 'that
the valuation of property in the
county would increase three per cent
a year.
C. R. Curry of Flemington," : said
that his preeinct favored good roads,
but was opposed to bonding., He said
that his section had been paying taxes
and not getting roads it should have,
and said that the roads mapped out
by the-promoters of the bond issue
would not be satisfactory to Fleming
ton precinct. .
Mr. Newcomb Barco of Cotton
Plant, made a plea for more nd bei
ter roads, in order, as he said, that
the people of the county might be bet
ter able to get in touch with one an
other, and he said that he thought his
precinct would vote for bonds -properly
handled. He said he was dot as
pessimistic as some -of the others, but
that his precinct was unanimous
against a bond issue as proposed.
At thi3 juncture Mr. Carn explain
ed that there semed to be a misunder
standing as to what had been pro
posed. He said that the roads that
had been outlined were merely sug
gestive, and not at all definite. He
said that the location of the roads
would be a matter for the people to
determine. He said that the sugges
tions had been made simply to start
discussion. ;

territory east of the Mississippi are
counted upon to bring some relief
from the heat wave. At. New York,
however, it is expected the humidity
record will be ' broken today. Two
deaths are reported there early. Chi
cago is still sweltering with no imme
diate relief in sight. No deaths re
ported there. . -
speaking for his - precinct favored
good roads, but opposed the bond is
sue. He thought the road problem of
the county was too great for five com
missioners to handle.
Mr. J. L. Adams of Shady, stated
that his precinct was opposed to a
bond issue under the present adminis
tration. , ". . - ;
Mr. J. W. Davis said that Summer
field precinct was heartily in favor of
good roads," but opposed to the bond
issue and roads as outlined.
Mr. John T. Lewis, speaking for
Lake Weir precinct, said that he
thought the people of that section of
the county in favor of good roads, but
opposed to a bond issue at this time.
Mr.'Gus Waters said that Linadale
precinct was 95 per cent opposed to
bonds at present, and 75 per cent op
posed to bonds at ' any time. He
thought the county should work it3
present" roads with improved machin
ery. .1
At- this point Mr. D. B. Kibler sug
gested that a vote be taken by the
convention for or against the propos
ed bond issue. Col. Rogers then of
fered his resolution to instruct the
county commissioners riot to call an
election to issue $900,000 worth of
bonds.''' ... ' '-.v- .. .
Mr. Carn, following the offering of
the resolution, said that it was plain
that the sentiment- of the county wa3
against bonds at this time. That be
ing the case, he thought there should
be no election at present, but that the
people of the county should continue
to investigate the question of bonding
arid of permanent roads with a view
to making a decision' at a later date.
Col. Rogers thought that the pres
ent roads would be entirely satisfac
tory if the county would divide them
into districts and maintain fthem , by
keeping men constantly in charge. He
thought that-the roads could be kept
up in this fashion for $50 a mile.
Mr. T. T. Munroe moved that the
convention adopt Col. Rogers reso
lution unanimously, and this was
done. '
Mr. Carn said that he favored di
viding tne roads into districts and
placing men on them to keep them up.
He thought this would be an improve
ment over the present method of
maintaining the roads. He did not
think it would solve the county's good
roads problem.
Mr. L. W. Duval thanks the dele
gates for attending the convention,
and asked them not to feel that Ocala
had any desire to have the county Jo
something it did not wish to do.

Legend of the French Poppy.
During the early stages of the pres
ent war a strange phenomenon on the
battlefields of northern France was
the abundance of popples, all the roads
being bordered by large tracts of the
red flowers, which gave the Impression
that the bloodshed there had come
forth to the surface once more. In
any case this Is the popular belief
among the peasants of the districts
where battles raged only some
months ago; but the real explanation
is. that the poppy is the companion
of wheat in France, just as the blue
bell mingles with the corn in Russia,
and that the poppy has usurped all
the space. ; -

. FAVOR OF IT
A Large and Well Pleased Attend-
ance on this Always Enjoyable
Occasion
Belleview, Aug. 7. The Oxford
annual barbecue held the stage all of
Saturday. The great affair is looked
forward to from year to year by peo
ple scattered all over the peninsula
Being as I had never attended one of
these affairs, I felt that it was my
duty to do so and through the kind
ness of Mr. Herman Rothschild, Miji
nie and I motored to Oxford behind a
pair of long-eared, hard-tailed hay
burners, familiarly known as mules
The drive was one well worth the
while taking, especially fromfSum-
merfield to the county line. As we
rolled along under the enormous oak
trees fronting Mr. Nathan ' Mayo's
house, it was delightfully cool, and
just beyond that, as, we dipped down
into the hollow and out again, a view
of excellent farm lands spread before
us, and as we bowled along over the
new road recently built -by Captain
Curry, every one was in high spirits.
We reached Oxford in "good season
and found the crowds gathering from
far and near. There must have been
seven or eight hundred people there
when we arrived, and the crowd
gradually swelled from that on, some
walking, some riding horses and
mules, some driving in buggies and
wagons, and others coming in auto
mobiles from all directions, and from
far distances, until it was estimated
that there were three thousand peo
pie on the grounds.
Belleview was well represented, as
was Ocala. ' Dr. and Mrs. E. Van Hood
and Miss Porter were easily the cen
ter of attraction. Wherever this good
couple go people single them out for
attention. I noticed the Honorable
John D. Robertson, mayor of Ocala,
who was entirely at home. The Ocala
postoffice force was well represented.
Mr. Frank Adams was there with his
brother; and had many a handshake.
One person I was glad to see was
Prof A. B. Connor, formerly of Belle
view, now of Inverness, and soon to
be of Lake City. The professor was
brimfull and running over with pros
perity. He looks and "acts it, and I
am glad of it. If any couple deserve
the good things of this life it is Mr.
and Mrs. A. B. Connor, which again
goes, to show the value of getting a
start in Belleview. ,
' Rev. S.; J. Catts mingled with the
crowd and told his tale to many will
ing listeners and also spoke for about
one hour. There is -one thing I 'can
say for Mr. Catts and that is he talks
right out in school. He says - just
what he things and " makes no bones
about, it. Mr. Catts was accompanied
by his son and Mr Brantley of Al
toona.' I met a nuiriber of the soldier
boys there from Black Point, also
Sergeant Blalock, acting as recruiting
officer. He had pretty good luck,
gathering into the fold twelve weary
wanderers, who will now be evolved j
through the process of building them j
up into men, fit and proud -enough to
carry guns in defense of the nation.
Sergeant Blalock was enthusiastic
dver the benefits to be derived by the
young men of this state from this
army mobilization. He also stated
that if the good women that furnished
the little pocket testaments to the
boys in khaki could see the good re
sults obtained hey would be proud of
their work. He stated that boys who
had never seen the inside of a Bible
took their lingering delight in perus
ing the pages and s exchanging views
with each other on wrhat they read. I
was glad to hear him give this testi
monial. '
Dinner time came with amazing
swiftness and the way the people
gathered to the feast was simply good
to see. All had come with their
mouths fitted for a great big hunk of
juicy, dripping barbecued meat, and
most of them filled the want.
. I wished to meet the one person
that had shouldered the bulk of the
burden in v engineering this big meet,
and under the guidance of Mr. Willie
McKay, I was introduced to Mr. Ossie
Hooks. I'then wanted to see the man
that was catering to the wants of the
inner man of the multitude of men
present, and we hunted out Mr. Jeff
Nichols, who proudly boasted of the
title of the chief cook and bottle
washer. He had his hands full. These
are the two men who shouldered the
responsibilities. .
The dinner over, the gathering re
solved itself into a talkfest, auction
house, horse trading bazaar and get
ting ready to go home. It was a beau
tiful day. It will be long remember
