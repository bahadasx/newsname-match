i
Declares They Were Hot as Repre- j
sented and Lays Complaint Before
Authorities.
Henry G. Southwick, secretary
and treasurer of the Southwick
Shops, Inc., 14th street and New
York avenue northwest, was arrested
this afternoon on a charge
of having violated the law to
prevent false advertising in the
District of Columbia. The warrant
was sworn out by C. E.
La Yigne, field representative of
the American Fair Trade League.
Bond was fixed at $500.
This is hut one of a number of arrests
which it is expected will be made in
Washington under the false advertising
law, which became effective last
May. Mr. La Vigne is co-operating with
the advertising vigilance committee of
the Retail Merchants' Association of j
this city, which was instrumental in
having the law passed.
First Arrest Made.
The arrest of Mr. Southwick is the
ftrBt to be made under the false adver
tis^ng law. Mr. La Yigne recently purchased
a number of articles at the
Soi.thwick shops, and claiming that the
goods were not as represented in the
advertisement he entered complaint
with the authorities.
The warrant was drawn up this
rnorriing and served by Detective Frank
M. Helan this afternoon.
While Mr. La Yigne entered his complaint
as a citizen of Washington, he
v ill have the full co-operation of th<- i
advertising vigilance committee of the
iietail Merchants' Association, the i
chairman of which is Joseph Berberich.
Work of obviating evidence |
' euainst stores believed to be violating
the false advertising law is to be started
immediately, it is said.
Warrant Is Issued. #
Mr. La Vigne called on John E
Laskey, United States attorney, Saturday
and made complaint. Mr. Laskey
topk the matter up with Ralph Given,
assistant United States attorney, at
Mr. Given's office this morning. It
was then decided to issue the warrant.
Henry G. Southwick was formerly
president of the MacDougal and Southwick
Co. Department Store in Seattle,
Wash.
He withdrew in 1908 and moved to !
New York.
The premises at 14th and New York
avenue were leased June 17, 1913, for a i
t eriod of four years and seven months.
The company is a subsidiary of the [
sOMthwick. Bayer Co. of New York,
capitalized at $160,000 in that state. It j
v as incorporated October 23. 1912.
Effective Campaign Begun.
Today's action marks but one step in a j
ampai^n which it is believed will be ef- ;
fective and far-reaching. The law '
against false advertising in the District i
of Columbia has now been in effect sey- j
eral months. While. moral suasion has j
been used with good effect In many in- j
| stances the time Is now at hand, say !
[ members of the advertising vigilance j
committee, when more drastic steps must
be taken.
Chairman Berberlch. interested in
truthful advertising in general and in the }
new law in particular, for which the Re- i
tail Merchants' Association is responsible. :
has decided that the time for "warnings" i
has passed. Several times within the j
? las* few weeks Chairman Berberich has
expressed his earnesteness in having the
"false advertising law" actively enforced. ,
In connection with this he has had sev- ;
eral conferences with Charles J. Colum- ,
bus, secretary of the Retail Merchants' :
Association and also secretary of the j
committee.
Previous to the passage by Congress of J
the truthful advertising law for the Dis- j
trict of Columbia, Mr. I-a Vigr.e addressed ;
the Retail Merchants' Association at the !
Raleigh Hotel upon the subject. A short
time ago Chairman Berberich met Mr. La j
Vigne again.
La Vigne Makes Investigation.
Mr. La Vigne had done much good
work In behalf of truthful advertising
in Mew York Mr. Berberich immediately
sought his co-operation in the .
V' hington situation. Mr. La Vigne
heard of many complaints which had
be*-n made concerning the conditions
her' and then went over the ground
In person.
He did this as a private citizen, hav- j
lng his home here. Then he went out to !
test some of the advertising.

whn h he has devoted his attention. He J
went to the store named and made a
number of purchases, noting carefully !
, th? values at whieh they were adverti

A Tale of a Shirt.
The most notable Incident in connection
with the purchases, perhaps, was
In connection with a shirt. This shirt
was advertised as reduced from a $2.50
value. As a matter of fact it bore a i
$2 00 tag. "marked down," ut the time !
of the pure has* . A red line was drawn j
through the $2.00 mark and in red fig- !
ur? y below v as inscribed. $1.29. the |
pric- which Mr La Vigne paid for it. |
This shirt was duplicated at one of ,
the most reliable men's stores in the j
city t r. regular sale for 79 cents, t
The o.ily difference. in design and texture.
according to experts who have
examined both shirts, is that the one
bought at the .'hop of the defendant
was of slightly inferior workmanship. In
addition to this, appraisers gave as J
their opinion that the shirt could never
have been sold at a regular sale, with
t only a fair degree of profit, as a $2.00
or $2.50 shirt.

PRESIDENT TO URGE I
-STRIKE MEDIATION
Federal Board Authorized to
Offer Services in His
Name.
DISAGREEMENT EXPECTED I
OF MEN AND OFFICIALS
Commissioners to Be in New York 1
Wednesday Prepared to Suggest
Methods for Peace.
/ .
That the 400,000 railroad employes
engaged in the movement
of trains, whose strike vote was
announced in New York today,
will not be able to reach an agreement
with the officials of the 225
railway systems by which they
are employed at the meeting arranged
for tomorrow is an open
secret among those in close touch
with the threatened nation-wide
strike.
It became known here today
that the federal board of media- r
tion and conciliation, with this r
condition in prospect, is prepar- f
in" to offer its services for ad0
justment of the difficulties Wed- i
nesdav. At that , time Com- 1
. ... u
missioner William L. Chambers c
and the other two members of 11
the federal board expect to be s
in New York, ready to act in this ?
crisis. f
President Back of Plan. .
Judge Chambers declined to confirm
this today. It is known on the best of
authority that this is the present plan
of the government authorities and is to
be carried out with the hearty approval ^
of President Wilson.
The federal board, in efTorts to induce
the parties to the controversy
that threatens the greatest railroad >
strike in history, to agree to mediation j ?
or arbitration, can tell these officials | t
that it is the personal wish of Presi- j 0
dent Wilson that they reach such an j t
agreement. If it is necessary, it is v
known that the President will himself p
address such an appeal to both the labor
organizations and to the railroads
in the interests of. the public.
Agreement for Arbitration. M
As an indication of the friendly position
the federal board holds toward ^
both the railroads and the brother- ;
u
hoods of employes. Judge Chambers ! a
announced, on the receipt of telegrams ' \
from New York, that Assistant Com- ^
missioner G. W. W. Hanger, who has p
been in New York for several days in i'
conference with officials of the Switchmen's
Union and with officers of cer- "
tain eastern railroads, that he expects t;
an agreement to arbitrate their differ- i:
ences will be signed today. n
Judge Chambers indicated that he has p
stropg hopes that the controversy, in a
which all the 1,700 railroads of the tl
country are united, can be settled bv a
the federal board through mediation h
without resort to arbitration. This o
feeling of optimism is echoed by other f
government officials who have been i;
considering the impending crisis. li

Railway Employes' Vote v
Overwhelmingly Favors
General Strike on Roads r
h
NEW YORK. August 7.?The task of ?<
counting the votes of approximately t:
400.000 railroad employes on the ques- a
tion of authorizing a general strike p
in the event that their demands for
an eight-hour day and time-and-a-half h
pay for overtime are finally denied, j ti
was completed just before noon today, \ ^
it was announced at headquarters here i r
of the four railroad brotherhoods. J t
Althougn no official statement could i
bd obtained as to the result, it was , tj
learned from an authoritative source ii
that the vote was overwhelmingly iri j<
fuv or of a strike. u
The full returns will be made known h
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, when the leaders o
of the men. A. B. Garretson. presldert of t
the Order of Railway Conductors; W. S. t
Stone. President of the Brotherhood Lo- t!
comotive Engineers; \V. S. Carter, presl- -s
dent of the Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,
and W. G. Lee. president of the n
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, will 1
resubmit their demands to the railroad c
managers.
Mr. Garretson. the official spokesman ?
for the men. said today that the order *
for the general strike would not be
given until all efforts to reach an
amicable agreement /failed. "While reiterating
that the men will not con- *
abler the railroads' plan of arbitration i *
under present conditions, he hinted that !
if a different form of arbitration is i a
proposed than under the Newlands act { w
: irict! will thf- rnilrrmH? Hole I
w;?y in avoiding a general strike.
' Tne contention of the brotherhoods has J
), *? n that arbitrators appointed under the '
X?*wlands act on previous occasions have i a
not been sufficiently familiar with rail- j b
road conditions and the employes have r.
suffered as the result of the awards. ! ,
It is expected that in the conference to- }e
morrow the question of the railroads' 'a
contingent proposition will again be the ! b
bone of contention. The roads still insist j p
that before considering the men's de- a
mauds, their proposition, dealing with so- t<
called arbitrages, be also considered. p

FOR CAPITAL AND LABOR
Etepublican Nominee Also Addresses
Suffragists, Reiterating Views of
Issue?Has Strenuous Day.
DETROIT, Mich., Auguts 7.?
Iharles E. Hughes, speaking tolay
to forty manufacturers of
Detroit and vicinity, employing
learly 100,000 men, congratulated
them upon what they had
Iqne for the welfare of their employes,
told them that the denocracy
of the United States
vould not stand for a continuaion
of "this alleged strife beween
capital and labor," and dedared
that the American worknan
should not be regarded as a
nere economic unit, but as "a
ellow-worker, a human being."
Mr. Hughes' address was impromptu
ind followed a brief speech by J. M.
Saton, spokesman for the manufacnr*?r?
nntlin^d thf u'Alfarp TrtPHS
ires for employes taken by industrial
oncerns here, and suggested that the
lominee indorse a movement looking to
he formation of a national welfare asociation
of manufacturers. Mr. Hughes
aid he regarded the suggestion very
avorably.
Addresses Group of Suffragists.
A few minutes later Mr. Hughes '
poke to a group of suffragists. The day i |
ras hot and the air of the little room j
rhere he received the manufacturers \
nd the suffragists was almost stifling,
'he nominee spoke with his wife stand- :
ng beside him. ' 1
Mr. Hughes reiterated in his address ;
o the suffragists his declaration in
?ew York that the suffrage question '
hould be settled speedily by giving
he vote to women all over the cotinry.
He added that he had formed this
pinion long ago, before he thought
he time would ever come when he ; (
rould have to announce his position
ublicly. *
Plea for Workingmen.
In his address to the manufacturers c
[r. Hughes said. In part: t
It 1b an awful mistake to think of a
he men through whose activity pro- (
uction is possible as mere economic , 5
nits. They are human beings, as we ! t
re all workingmen in this country.
\*e are in different spheres of activity, j 1
ut we ought to have a sense of co- i C
peration. so that every man takes
ride iii what he is doing, and in doing
t to the best of his ability, because he r
t working alongside of every other '
lan for the good of the country.
"In your welfare work you are but ! r
ressing democracy. The human factor j
b. after all, the important factor. You i 8
lay develop your physical plants, your \ a
hysical instrumentalities, distribution
nd everything that goes to make up j c
he material side of prosperity, but you
re absolutely hopeless without the ,
uman factor, and in America, the land : a
?f freemen, the man who is at work r
or a living must feel that the country r
s doing the right thing by him. He j r
b entitled to be safe In his work, to ; ;
lave every precaution taken against ;
very sort of accident that can be preented.
j v
Speaks of "Good Americanism." ; *'
"A man is put at work. How can he i ?
efuse the Job which stands between '
im and starvation? It Is perfectly r
lie to say in our industrial conditions *
hat he can take or refuse the work >
ccording to his idea of the safety ap- 1
liances which may be provided to pro- j ^
ect him. You have got to protect ;
im. No man can work in any posi- j J
ion where his life, his limb or his j a
ealth is subject to any unnecessary j 1
Isk. That is good Americanism and !
hftt is good business. j i
"We are not materialists in this coun- I
ry; we are all idealists, but the one
ling that appeals to the workingman j
? the idea thai he is equal to some!
ob in a first-class way. That is what j
lakes him proud: that is what makes,
im satisfied, and when you consider
ur great industrial manufacture and ;
he enormous extension of our indus- j
rial markets the hope is that in all ;
his there will be right through it the
pirit of human brotherhood, of fel- i
Dwship and of co-operation, so that ; c
lanagers and workingmen will feel f
hat they are engaged in a common | j
ause.
"And we will get through with this 1
Id strife between labor and capital. J j
>emocracy cannot stand it. We are not t
iborers and capitalists in this coun-|
ry. We are fellow citizens.
"That is what I stand for, and there- | i
ore, because you enrich our citizen- 10
hip. because you build permanent the '
oundations of our society, I greet you '
nd I wish you the best success in your I
rork."
Busy Day for the Nominee.
Arriving from Niagara Falls shortly ! j
fter 8 o'clock today, the nominee had a ! v
usy day before him. With a series of
eceptions, conferences with party lead- s
rs?progressive as well as republicans? i K
visit to Navin field to witness part of a ?
all game*, a tour of local automobile C
lants. a luncheon with newspaper men t
nd two speeches in the largest audi- r
orlum in the city, Mr. Hughes faced a
rogram that left him little time that he
ould call really his own. Political suporters
of the republican nominee from
11 over Michigan and from bordering c
tates were on hand to greet him. t
Heads Auto Parade. (
Upon his arrival here Mr. Hughes I
eaded a long automobile parade from g
he station to his hotel, a mile and a (
alf away. A brass band played j
opular tunes and giant firecrackers (
?*ere exploded along the line of march, j
'housands of persons, witnessed the c
arade. 1
With Mr. Hughes' arrival it became c,
mown that an advisory committee of :

WULING TO SURRENDER
| THE M'LEAN LETTERS
I Francis T. Homer Files Answer to
Suit Brought by Edward
B. McLean.
i
Answer was filed late this afternoon
in the District Supreme Court by
Francis T. Homer of New York and
Baltimore to the injunction proceedings
recently brought against him by
Edward B. McLean to secure posses- j
j slon of certain personal and private j'
(letters of the late John R. McLean.
| Mr. Homer tells the court that the '
| letters were delivered to him by Al- J
j fred B. Leet, trust officer of the Amerj
ican Security and Trust Company, in
j the presence of Edward B. McLean. (
j with instructions that he examine the ?
letters and destroy all that were of no
interest to the estate of John McLean.
Willing- to Give Them Up. ]
When the proceeding was brought ]
against him and the court restraining
j order laid upon him, Mr. Homer says
. he had examined not more than half
! of the epistles and does not, therefore,
! know the entire contents of them. He j
| tells the court that John R. McLean
had requested him to destroy certain j
! letters to be found among- his effects,
: but that he is not aware that similar :
j instructions had been given the, son, !
; Edward B. McLean.
j Mr. Homer declares that he has no
i interest in the letters except to carry
j out the request for their examination '
j made to him, a^id he expresses a will- I
j ingness to have such disposition made !
( of them as the court may deem right
| and proper and by its order may direct
j him to do.
Asked Son for Assistance.
| In his answer Mr. Homer refers to a let;
ter which he says Edward B. McLean has I(
; advised him is in liis possession. How j(
j young Mr. McLean came by the letter Mr. ! '
; Homer says he does not know, but de- 1
i clares "this defendant, upon examining i5
j said letters, found that some thereof re- j 1
lated to thinsrs of which your defendant j1
hadf no personal knowledge and requested j ^
the plaintiff herein to pass upon said let- j 1
ters with him, which was done, but j <
whether in so dbing the plaintiff took said j,
letter or not this defendant does not know;
and therefore cannot state." 1
The answer of Mr. Homer was re- <
ceived through the mail by the clerk
and he is not represented by counsel.
Hearing on the rule for a continuance 1
of the restraining order against the de- 1
livery by Mr. Homer of the letters to j
the American Security and Trust Com- ,
pany, executor unde# the will of John
R. McLean, is scheduled for Wednes- 1
day morning before Justice Stafford. [

last February in a bottle picked up
In the Skagerrak, containing last messages

LIEUT. COL STEPHAN
FIRED ON FROM AMBUSH
Attacked While With Troops Maneuvering
Near Alexandria,
But Is Not Hit.
While maneuvering: with the troops
this morning: in the vicinity of Alexandria
Lieut. Col. Anton Stephan was
fired upon from ambush. He had left
the main force and was making: a short
cut througrh a lane and approaching
an abandoned house, when some
one opened fire with a shotgun. He
was not hit by any of the shots, but
they peppered around him in every
direction. On investigating the vicinity
of the shooting he found a loaded pistol
containing ball ammunition.
This is onlv one of many instances
of shooting into the camp which have
become a regular occurrence every
evening. The shots are Relieved to
come from a colored settlement back
of the camp.
Excitement reigned in the Y. M. C. A.
tent this morning when it caught fire in
some unknown manner. A squad of
men who were present at the time
succeeded in putting out the flames before
they had consumed the tent. It is
presumed that the fire was caused by
the careless casting aside of a cigarette
butt.
INFANTILE PARALYSIS

Last Daily Report.
NEW YORK, August 7.?Today marked
he beginning of the sixth week of the
epidemic of infantile paralysis, and the
laily bulletin issued by the health department
showed that the plague continues

An appeal was issued today to persons
who had suffered from infantile
paralysis and who have recovered to
jive small quantities of their blood so
that a serum could be obtained and
idministered to those now victims of
similar attack. It was stated that this

DANES OPPOSE ISLAND SALE.
Majority of Rigsdag, However, Believed
to Approve Treaty.
COPENHAGEN, August 6. via London,
August 7.?While the belief still seems
to prevail that a majority of the rigsdag
approves the sale of the Danish
West Indies to the United States, the
agitation* against thus disposing of the
islands appears to be growing throughout
the country, influential provincial
papers strongly denouncing the proposal.
An opening meeting of the rigsdag to
discuss ratification of the transfer has
been fixed for next Thursday. The concession
by the United States in agreeing
to recognize Denmark's supremacy
over the whole of Greenland is generally
regarded as important, and is approved.
Should the rigsdag ratify the sale of
the islands the transfer will be arranged
speedily.

Australians Make a Clean
Sweep of German Positions Against
Which They Charge
* WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IX
FRANCE. August 5, via London, August
7.?Under a merciless concentration of
shell fire, the Australians are holding
on to their gains today after their
advance last night on a front of two
miles. The Germans* already have delivered
three powerful counter attacks
to retake the lost ground, and all havfc
failed.
In one of the counter attacks the
Germans came forward holding up their
hands. Behind them the British guns
had placed curtains of shell fire,
through which it was impossible for
them to retreat, while the Australians'
machine guns and rifles, mowing them
down, made it hopeless to continue the
charge. It was death whichever way
they moved?death if they stood still
or lay down in the bullet-swept space,
and they surrendered rather than continue
their vain efforta,
Attack on Left Flank.
Their last previous attack, having
been by the right flank, the British
renewed the offensive by the left flank
after a week of bombing and sapping.
Here the task fell to the Australians,
who added another victory to, their
brilliant record in the taking of
Pozieres. In grilling heat, under a
blazing sun, they had been working in
a continual shell Are. digging their
new trenches in the open beyond
Pozieres, facing the German second
line trenches, on the left of the break
the British already had made in their
previous attacks.
This was one of the remaining important
positions on .the high ground
