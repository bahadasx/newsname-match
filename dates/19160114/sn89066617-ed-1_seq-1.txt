EXONERATING MATE
Says Miss Crawleo Went To Hus

questSuit Planned
John M. Keys, nigh, manager of
the Western Union Telegraph office,
last night issued a signed .statement,
in explanation of report' concerning
an episode at the office of the tele
graph company last Monday night,
when the police .surrounded the build
ing after they discovered Miss S.i. io
Crawley, a stenographer for AUotr. y
H. E. Alexander, seated in (he cfic.
Miss Crawley, who had b a a
guest at the Keys honi .'.hat cv i.ir.g,
was preparing to leave cn the morn
ing traiu for St. Louis. At the re
quest of Mrs. Keys, he agreed to wait
in the telegraph compan"s office with
Miss Crawley until train time. The
young woman was accompanied to
the Western Union office from the
Keys home by Roy Clark, a brother
of Mrs. Keys.
The Tribune last night presented
Mr. Kevs' statement to his wife for i
confirmation. She has ;nly recently
recovered from a serious operation
and was much concerned over the re
flections cast upon her husband and
Miss Crawley.
"I am to blame, if there is any re
sponsibility to be fixed," .she said.
"Miss Crnwley is a close personal
friend of mine, and I suggested tfuit
she go tc the telegraph office with my
brother and wait until her train left.
These vicious reports must be stop
ped. It is just a case of slander, and
Iwant to be a witness for Miss Craw
ley, wh-) is going to sue for dam
age.?." The police, who did not enter the
office, telephoned Fred Wood, the
manager of the telegraph office, who
responded quickly. He entered the
office and found Mr. Keys and .Miss
Crawley. The story related by Keys
to Wood was virtually the Fame as
his signed statement.
The explanation, signed by Mr.
Keys, in full, follows:
"Last Monday evening when I was
leaving home for my work, Mrs.
Keys told me that Miss Susie Craw
ley, a friend of ours, was going to St.
Louid on the morning train, and as
she was afraid she would not catch
the train, asked me if it would be all
right for her to come to the office and
remain there until train time.
"Miss Crawley, who was at our
house, was accompanied to the office
by Mrs. Keys' brother. Roy Clark,
and upon his departure, Policeman
Whitener asked him, what was "com
ing off," and not being satisfied with
the information he received, stood
around in the alley during a heavy
rain storm, peeking through the win
dows until the rain drove him away.
"Then he proceeded to come rushing
through the side door which was
open, but could have saved himself
the trouble, for the front door was
ajar.
"I told Whitener that the young
lady was a friend of my wife's and
was going away on the morning
train, and was afraid .sh-? would miss
the train if she remained at home, so
my wife requested that she stay at
the office with me until the train left.
"This explanation was not enough,
for Mr. Whitener and he began to
make insulting remarks.
"In about thirty Minutes he re
turned, accompanied by Policeman
Beeve and Talley. Beeve immediate
ly hammered on the side door, de
manding that I open this "blankety
blak" door or I will kick the blank
ety blank down.
"I then told him that if he had
nerve enough to kick it in to come or
in with it.
"I cautioned him that his language
was very improper, especially in the
presence of a young lady.
"But his continuance caused the
young lady to become very much
frightened and I then called a friend
of mine in order to have a witness to
any remarks that they might make
but upon their arrival and my open
ing the door they were unwilling to
come in the office to obtain the infor-
Mi3 Scnotield'B recent entrance into
the society of the national capital was
wclo cued enthusiastically, for before

most popular of the younger leaders.
"CON" MAN CASHES
$10 CHECK IN CAPE
Gives Paper When He Buys
Goods At Bergman-Bartels
Store.
The story of how a confidence
check-artist passed a worthless draft
for $10 at the Borgmann-Bartles
Merc. Co.. last night became known
when William Bartel.s investigated
the methods which tho "con" man
used in his operation.
One day during the latter part of
last week, the man entered the store
on upper Broadway, where he ap
proached Will Bartels. lie became
confidential with Mr. B;-'; nr.d ex
dained that he was a t'ie salesman.
He gave his name as Foster, and said
that he represented a firm in Ohio.
He then asked Mr. Bartels to tell
him what he knew about the credit
rating of an automobile man. He
explained that he had partly nego
tiated a deal whereby he was selling
the auto man an especially large con
signment of tires, and wanted advice.
After this part of the conversation,
he remarked that he had had trouble
in getting his laundry returned and
ai ranged to purchase a new shirt, a
pair of glove-; and some collars.
In payment, he offered a draft on
an outside bank for 10. The draft
was honored, and considerable change
given. Mr. Bartels received it back
yesterday, marked "Xo funds."
He then made, inquiry at the gar
age of the motor car salesman con
cerning his purported tire salesman
and learned there never had been
such a deal pending.

short time before.
"A certain party in this city, a
member of whose family has lived a
life of scandal, is attempting to hold
Miss Crawley up to public scorn, and
to absolve her, I have made the above
statement."
Patrolman Arthur Whitener last
night denied that he useu offensive
languaire. "I simply made an inves
tigation and then reported the matter
to Chief Hutson, who sent Beeve

er, agair.st A. V. Bayley, Jr., insur
ance agent, for injuries she alleges
she sustained when struck by Bay
ley's automobile last fall.
The accident occurred about noon
on November 15, last, at the foot of
Giboney hill on the Rock Levee road.
Bayley was driving his, car south on
the west side of the "7-oad- and had
just passed a wagon which was being
driven north at a low r:.te of speed

Mrs. Caracker, who was carrying
a baby in her arms, was walking
north on the road accompanied by
another woman. The companion ran
across the road in front of the auto
mobile. Mrs. Caracker started to
follow and halted.
While she was standing in the mid
dle of the road, the car approached
and she tried to back- away. She
threw the baby she held in her arms
to the side of the road. The machine
then struck her and after backing up
a few paces, she fell and the car
rolled over her.
At the time of the accident, wit
nesses said the wheels did not pass
over her body.
In the petition filed in the court
yesterday, Mrs. Caracker stated that
Bayley failed to use proper care in
swerving his car to the left of her
and avoid hitting her. She also as
serted that he was traveling at a rate
of 25 miles an hour and declared that
the wheels of the car passed over her
body, bruising her and causing inter
nal injuries.

she has incurred bills for medical and
surgical treatment and medicines
amounting to $500.
Mrs. Caracker's petition was filed
by J. A. Barks, J. H. Caruthers and
H. E. Alexander as her attorneys.
Judge Edward D. Hays, attorney
for Mr. Bayley, yesterday afternoon
denied the allegation that Bayley was
traveling at the rate of 25 miles an
hour and that he was not using all
the means at his disposal to prevent
the accident.
