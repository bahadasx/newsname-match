broke out near the furnace in the

way through the auditorium and out
through the roof, eriously damaging
the building, furniture and fixtures,
completely destroying the piano and
practically ruining the pipe organ,
entailing a total loss of about three
thousand five hundred dollars, which
is only partially covered by insur
ance. Through the kindness of Mr.

PROTEST BIRTH OF NATION.
A delegation from the Des Moines
branch of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored Peo
ple, consisting of Atty. S. Joe Brown,
Pres. Hon. Harvey Ingham, Editor
John L. Thompson and Mr. E. R.
Hall of the publicity committee Mr.
Jesse A. Graves, member of the board
of directors, and Attys. Casper
Schenk and Geo. H. Woodson of the
legal redress committee, accompanied
by Mr. John B. Hammond, a repre
sentative of the Iowa Purity associ
ation, called at the mayor's office on
Monday afternoon and presented the
•formal protest of the Des Moines
branch against the photo play, "The
Birth of a Nation," scheduled to ap
pear at the Berchel theater in this
city next April.
The principal argument was made
by Atty. Woodson, who had seen the
play, and gave a detailed description
of it, which was listened to with in
terest by the mayor and Councilman
Myerly, who happened in during the
conference and who stated in very
strong terms that if the production
was anything like it was reported he
considered it in violation of certain
of the city ordinances and therefore
should be prohibited and the mayor,
while not expressing himself as free
ly as Mr. Myerly, announced to the
delegation that he would present the
matter to Mr. Mitchell, the superin
tendent of public safety, and to El
bert & Getchell, proprietors of the
Berchel theater, and attempt to pro
cure their voluntary withdrawal of
the play, as they did upon his request
wihdraw the stage production of the
play called "The Nigger," which they
had advertised to appear at the Prin
cess theater during his first adminis
tration several years ago, and against
which a similar protest was filed.

reform have also been appealed to
and it is hoped will join with the na
tional association in their protest
against the production in Des Moines
of this exhibition ,which is conceded
by all who have seen it to be not only
of an immoral tendency but also a
libel upon the veterans of the Grand
Army of the Republic as well as up
on the American Negro.
OBITUARY.
Gibbs Lamar Johnson was born at
New Orleans, La., August 6. 1888,
and resided in that state until the
month of August, 1910, when he re
moved to the state of Iowa and set
tled in Des Moines, where he spent
the remainder of his life. On July 8,
1911, he was married to his present
widow, then Miss Jennie Story of this
city, who proved to be a most devoted
companion and was at his bedside ad
ministering to his every want when
death claimed him at Mercy hospital
in this city Sunday, January 9, 1916.
at 10:20 p. m., after a brief illness of
only nine days.
Shortly after coming to Des Moinea
he was initiated into the Order of
Elks and was soon elevated to the
highest station in his lodge, that of
exalted ruler. Later he became a
member of the Masonic fraternity and
was advanced to the degrees of Royal
Arch and Knight Templar, in which
latter, the highest branch of York
Rite Masonry, he was just recently
elected to the office of junior warden.
During the winter of 1915, under the
pastorate of Rev. E. G. Jackson, he
joined the St. Paul's A. M. E. church
and lived a consistent Christian until
the end came, He leaves to mourn
his loss a devoted wife, a loving
mother and father, ten sisters and
one brother, all except the widow re
siding at Pass Christian, Miss. The
funeral services were held at St.
Paul's A. M. E. church Wednesday
afternoon, in charge of North Star
lodge, A. F. & A .M., and King Solo
mon commandery of Knights Tem
plar, the Rev. S. L. Birt, pastor, offi
ciating, and in the face of one of the
worst blizzards Des Moines ever ex
perienced, with the mercury register
ing five degrees below zero, a large
representation of the membership oil
the church, the Masonic and the Elk
fraternities turned out to pay the
last tribute of respect to his memory.
Beautiful floral emblems were pre
sented by North Star Masonic lodge,
3. H. Cleggett chapter of Royal Arch
-Masons, King commandery
of Knights Templar, Hawkeye lodge
of Elks, also by the Mary Church
Terrell club, of which the widow is a
member. A committee from North
Star lodge and the escort from King
Solomon commandery accompanied
the remains to their last resting place
in Glendale and there deposited them
with the honors due a Knight Tem
plar of his rank.
KANSAS CITY SELECTED.
National Negro Business League to
Hold Seventeenth Annual Ses
sion August 16, 1916.
After a most careful consideration
of the several invitations received
from different sections of the coun
try for the next meeting of the Na
tional Negro Business League, we
are authorized by the members of the
executive committee to announce that
the league has decided to accept the
invitation extended by the Local Ne
gro Business League of Greater Kan
sas City. The meeting will be held
August 16, 17 and 18, 1916.
It appears that the business league
has selected a most opportune time
to hold their meeting in Kansas City,
for as Mr. Fortune J. Weaver, presi
dent of the Kansas City local league
says:
"These dates fit in just right, as the
Masons will hold their grand lodge in
Kansas City during the second week
of August and the National Medical
association comes during the fourth
week."
These two meetings in addition to
the Business League session will offer
best possible inducements to the rail
roads to make special reduced fares
and will afford delegates to the grand
lodge and the Medical Association an
opportunity to attend some of the
sessions of the Business League.
The executive committee has also
decided that it will be most appro
priate and fitting that the first
night's (August 16th) session be de
voted to memorial exercises in honor
of Dr. Booker T. Washington, found
er and first president of the National
Negro Business League.
