SEATTLE BUSINESS
MEN SANDBAGGED!
Thousands of Tourists to Coast Are Sidetracked and Kept From Seattle by
Tactics of 0-W. and Allied Railroads! Hands of Chamber of Commerce
Are Tied, and Commercial Club Slumbers! Business Men Must Act.
THIS it a call to arms to every business
man in Seattle.
It is a call to rally 'round the old stand
ard of the Almighty Dollar!
This is the year of promise.
And you aren't in business, you know,
1 for your health!
For years Seattle and the Northwest
have been "looking out the window" while
California cities—Los Angeles and San
Diego—have been helping themselves to
millions of dollars in real Uncle Sam's coin,
half of which belonged to you!
• • • • •
PERHAPS you didn't know it, but 90 per
cent of tourist travel from the Fast goes to
California, not because California's climate is
better than Washington's, not because of finer
f*scenery or better accommodations, BUT BE
CAUSE OF UNFAIR, DISCRIMINATORY
RAILWAY PASSENGFR RATES.
It costs the traveler $21.75 more to go from
Chicago to San Francisco via Seattle than it
does to San Francisco via New Orleans, El Paso
and Los Angeles! AND THE DISTANCE
OVER THE SOUTHERN ROUTE IS
GREATER BY 253 MILES.
In summer, when special tourist rates arc
in effect, the difference is $17.50, the preferen
tial favoring the Southern route!
That preferential means this:
That unless the traveler has relatives
living in the Northwest, or comes here on a
matter of business, he uill take the South
ern route.
That Seattle hotel men are losing 90
f>er rent of their legitimate summer tourist
business.
That Puget Sound steamer men are
making just 10 per rent of what they
should make in the summer from tourist
patronage.
That real estate dealers, street railuays,
department stores —in fart every line of
business and every individual business man
in this sertion of the United States, is los
ing money every year.
With the preferential wiped out, every man
who caters to tourist business in Seattle could sit
down and multiply his present summer profit
by nine!
WHAT'S the remedy?
Here it is. Get it!
Chairman C. E. Reynold#, of the state
public service commission, has figured it out.'
He has filed a complaint in the interest
of the people of this state with the interstate
commerce commission at Washington, ask
ing that the preferential be eliminated.
The complaint is directed against the
Southern Pacific, the Union Pacific and the
Oregon-Washington Railroad and Naviga
tion Co., allied lines.
THESE ROADS, OWNED BY THE
SAME INTERESTS, ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE PREFERENTIAL.

The Seattle Star
THE ONLY PAPER IN SEATTLE THA"f DARES TO PRINT THE NEWS :
VOLUME II SEATTLE. WASH. FRIDAY, JANUARY 14. 1916
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
COULDN'T HELP, BECAUSE IT HAD
acc:»; ptei) (-OMRi buttons from
THESE RAILROADS.
"I was astounded," says Reynolds. "I told
him it was the chamber's duty to look after the
interests of the business men of Seattle, that it
was really the chamber's duty to file the com
plaint with the interstate commerce commis
sion.''
I he Star has asked Secretary Yandcll about
this. 1 It- denies the chamber took money from
these railroads. Ile said the chamber is ready
to work hand-in-hand with the public service
commission in supplying the interstate com
merce commission with evidence when the time
! comes.
REYNOLDS then went to the Commercial
(!lub. I le himself introduced a resolution,
calling attention to this differential, and pledg
ing the club's support, by every legitimate
power possible, to wipe out the discrimination.
I The resolution was referred to a committee,
of the club. Ihe committee reported that the
discrimination is unjust, and the club instructed
the committee to register a kick with the inter
state commerce commission. The committee
forgot or neglected to kick and the club went to
sleep. It had passed the resolution. Now it is
resting on its oars.
Most club members had forgotten, if they
ever knew, that the differential question had
ever come up.
• • • • •
REYNOLDS' dander was up. After many
advisors told him he was going up against
a brick wall, he got the state com
mission itself to file complaint directly with the
interstate commerce commission.
The complaint is on file. Of course it may
he years before a decision is reached. There
will he unending litigation.
And in the meantime w hat?
"The fight can be won without the
courts," says Reynolds, "if only the people
of this state can be apprised of the facts. The
fight can be won if the business men are told

how they are being discriminated against.
It can be won by the moral support of the
people."
AND SO REYNOLDS CAME TO THE
STAR.
"I knew it would be no use to go to the
other papers," he said.
Reynolds came to the right place.

It means money to Seattle and Washington.
I "It is the biggest thing in a financial way that could
be put over for this city and the Northwest." says Reynolds.
It is up to Seattle business men to get together behind
The Star.
The interstate commerce commission probably will take
the case in hand about the first of June.
Before that time it is your duty, Mr. Business Man,
to yourself and your pocket book, to creatc a sentiment in
j tn«vor of an equal jnuiHi-tnp rate over all roads Jrora Chi

T\KI the u»e of Bill Jones and John Smith, grocer*.
Just suppose the Scliwabacher Co., wholesale grocers,
should say to Jones:
'We don't like you. So it will cost you 5 cents a
pound more for our coffee than we charge Smith."
How long do you suppose Jones would stand for
that ?
He'd beat it o\er to the National (irocery Co. or
some other wholesale firm, wouldn't he?
YET THE BUSINESS MEN OF SEAT
TLE, IN SPITE OF THE DISCRIMINA
