DEAD BODY OF A
NEAR FORT GAY, WHERE HE WAS
PROBABLY MURDERED BY
A COMPANION.
DEATH COMES TO GEO. HATTEN.
Word of the death of Oeorge Hatten,
at his home at Prichard, W. Va., was
received here yesterday. He died Wed
nesday night of Blight's disease and
had been ill for some time.
Mr. Hatten, a prominent farmer and
stock raiser, was one of the wealthiest
citizens of Wuyne-co. He wus a di
rector of the First National. Bank of
Kenova.
The funeral will be held at the res
idence at ten o'clock this morning and
interment will be made In the family
burial ground. Herald-Dispatch.
The dead body of a stranger and for
eigner was found last Monday about
two miles east of Fort Gay, West Va.,
on the Poorburg branch of Mill creek.
The body was in a thicket about 200
yards from the public road.
In a pocket of his clothing was found
a ticket issued by the Pond Creek Coal
company, bearing the mime of George
Tomoloa. A bottle of whisky and $1.65
in money was found on his person. Al
so some cartridges, but no pistol.
The man had been shot twice. One
bullet entered the head Just in the edge
of the hair near the temple. The other
passed through both cheeks. It was
evident that death ftook place several
day before the body was discovered.
That, it is a case of murder there is
hardly a doubt.
It Is said that on Monday, one weekv
before the body was found, this mm
wus seen near Fort Gay in company
with another foreigner. Later In the
day the companion of the dead man
was ferried or'tn some way conveyed
across Mill creek Ity a citizen of the
neighborhood. The man came on down
to Fort Gay and no further trace or
him has been found. He was carrying
two suit case.
Various theories are being advanced
but all seem to agree that the dead man
met his fate at the hands of his com
panion. One report says Togroloa had
nearly 1200 when he left his boarding
place in the coal fields a short time be
fore his death. Another theory con
nects the two men with numerous rob
beries of stores in the coal fields and
a possible fulling out with each other
at the time of the killing.
The body wns burled near Fort Cay
at the expense of the county, after an
Inquest was held.
The case against Webb Holt and
Henry Bussey, Jointly indicted for the
murder of William Davis, was called

et Wednesday afternoon. There were
very many cases tried and probably .
more were continued. The first fel

The case of the Commonwealth
against Dr. Stambaugh, of Beaver ..
creek, charged with false swearing as
a witness for the defendant in the case
against Nathan C. Day, charged with
the murder of the Russian showman in
October, 1914 occupied considerable
time. Many witnesses were examined
on both sides and considerable time
was taken in arguing the case, After !
having been out for several hours the
Jury reported to the court that It could
not muke a verdict. It wus according-
Jy discharged by the court and the case
was Continued until the next term. It
is said that the jury stood eight for
acquittul and four for conviction.

PROSPECTS FOR B. & O.
LOOK VERY PROMISING.
ftvery visible Indication points to the
building of a line of railroad bv the B.
& O. railroad from Shelby in I'ike-co.,
down the Levisa fork of the Big Sandy
to Louisa.
Knglneers are now at work on what
Is said to be a final survey. The pre
liminary survey was made nbout two
years ago. Maps of the route have
been "filed In all counties. Rights of
way nt some points have" been pur
chased. The B. O. owns 28 miles of
road from Shelby to Jenkins. It has
another line reaching from the east to
Kenova, W. Va.
The building of this line seems to be
the logical move for the B. & ()., and
unless unforeseen ' obstacles should
arise as to rights of way, etc., there Is
good reason to believe the rood will be
built. . . ' ,: -.
