Waslhngton, I). Jan. 14.—Gen-!
pral Carranza to-day telegraphed his \
ambassador here as follows from bis
headquarters at Queretaro:
"The murderous atlaek on the pas
senger train near Chihuahua was
made by the only remaining hand of
outlaws in that region. This hand is
being pursued by my troops with a
x lew to insure its eapture whereupon
punishment, whieh their I'rltne de
serves. will lie applied to every guilty j
f participant.
••Troops of the eonstitntionalist gov- j
eminent have been ordered to estab
listi patrol front end to end of the
railroad line in order to guard against j
a similar outrage."
General Carranza's dispatch was j
the llrst direct assurances that he will j
romply with the urgent representa- I
tlons of the United States Govern
ment.
I'pon the success of the steps he i
takes, the next move in the Mexican
situation seems lo depend.
Will Wait Awhile
After Chairman Stone, of the Sen- |
ate Foreign Relations Committee, had
discussed the situation with the Presi- j
• lent, he returned to the Senate chain- j
her and again expressed the view that '
the United States should not move to-I
ward armed intervention until the \
< 'arranza government had demon- j
strated whether it was capable of con
trolling the country.
Senator Works, Republican, intro-,
duced a resolution proposing armed (
intervention, and declared that Con
gress should share with the President I
the responsibility for whatever is j
done.
State Department dispatches added |
practically nothing new to the situa- i
tion In Mexico.
Committed Crime
"It would be monstrous for the j
United States to go to war in Mexico j
at such time as this," declared Sen- '
ator Stone, after his return to the!
t'apitol. "We have recognized a gov
ernment and it would be absurd to
rush in without giving that govern
ment a chance to suppress and punish
the bandit bands that have murdered!
American citizens. 1 think that
\mericans who venture into such j
places and Americans who venture
forth on belligerent ships into war i
/.ones are committing a crime against l
the government whose protection they!
seek. Of course, we must try to pro- j
tect them. They have a technical ie- |
gal right to go into dangerous places !
hut they should not do it. if possible ,
to avoid it and thus embarrass the
United States."
