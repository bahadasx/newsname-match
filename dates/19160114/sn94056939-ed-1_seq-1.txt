Newlands, democrat, of Novada
sovercly criticised his own parly for

PARTY IS TOO RADICAL
Although he characterized the
general trend of Dmnncratio legisla
lionas commendable the senator
asserted thai I he party was too
radical and expressed I ho convlo,
lion "that un political party can
hope to remain iu power which ad
opts radical instead of evolutionary
methods of reform."
DANGER OF DEFEAT
Danger of a Democratic defoat In
the congressional elections of 1014,
ho said, was ''averted only by tint
European war, which brought into
sudden contrast tho president's
pulley of watchful waiting regard
ing Mexico with the madness of the
European nations as they rushed
into the war and made that puiioy
as popular as it lias heretofore buen
unpopular."
