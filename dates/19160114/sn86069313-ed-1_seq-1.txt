.Oniccr Gives Details of the Fight In
Which Dlucchcr Was
Hunk.
u
London, Jan. 8. Undor escort of
officers assigned by the admiralty, a
correspondent of tho Associated
Tress and a party of foreign Journal
ists, recently wore given the first
opportunity to visit one of tho great
'sww, 3fl'royers and submarines are
seesBbled for tho watch over tho
",Nth Sco and from which point
big, ocean-going submarines are sent
on forages to tho Baltic and the Dar
danelles. It waa an Imprcsslvo sight of con
centratcd power and alert readiness,
with long lines of battlo-scarrod
cruisers stretching seaward and
3ieaded by the famous Arethusa, back
of them a vast flotilla of destroyers,
ihen a countless numbor of submar
ines, of tho latest D and E. typo,
which have recently performed such
brilliant work from tho Dardanelles
to tho Dosphorus and throughout
the Baltic Sea.
The day was typical of tho rigors
tho British fleet is now experiencing
In tho North 8ea with rain pelting
the sailors in oilskins, and tho wind
cutting tho sea into foam and sea
gulls everywhere. The Uttlo Ashing
village on tho coast had been trans
formed by tho war Into a vast naval
rendezvous with storo houses stretch
ing a half mllo, prepared to re-cquip
an armanda and send It back to sea
within two hours of Its arrival.
Hero also wero tho "mother" ships
Tanging In long lines along tho
quay, ready to receive back their
.fighting chjldren each tlrao they
came, from a raid or a battlo.
The huge establishment was vi
brating jvlth onorgy, and In the har
bor mlno sweepers wero coming back
from their work; hydroaeroplanes
-wero maneuvering from tho deck of
their craft and black smoko from the
funnels of tho. cruisers and destroy
ers told of their readiness to dash
out to sea after an enemy craft
Tells of Sea Battle.
The Arethusa and tho light cruls
rr squadron had just returned from
scouting along the German coast In
search of a a or man fleet which was
:sald to have ventured out from tho
IClol Canal. Nothing had been seen
-of tho Germans ships and tho Brit
ish officers tho same who had now
.received their stars In tho famous
fights under Vice Admiral Sir Davo
IBcatty wero deslaive at tho Idea
that tho Germans would venture
forth.
Ono of the officers was tn com
mand of the torpedo tubes when
they fired tho deadly missiles which
struck tho German cruiser Bloucher
and sent her reeling to the bottom
in tho great fight of last January.
Ho pointed out those selt-samo tubes
nnd told how they had worked.
'First wo let go that ono." ho
said, "and then this one. It was
this ono that hit tho Bloucuer amid
ships. Sho waB lying off there about
1,500 yards. Tho thing that Im
pressed me after wo hit her was tho
deathly stillness. It was terribly
still until the- great bjg ship throw
tip her bow, turned clean over and
sank."
"Yes, this Is the ono that did It,"
.and he patted this terrible, death
deallng engine affectionately, as If
tit wore Ula child, as, in truth, It has
been sinco ho sunk tho Bluecher,
Scars of battlo, were all over tho
ship, which tho officers pointed out
.-with the pride that a Heidelberg stu
dent displays when he exhibits his
-wounds. A deck gallery amidships
Tiad been entirely shot away, a me

Ihjjejj'Ow weat aje4'rd the
latest typo of big destroyers which
are hero ranged In great battalions
with steam up. They are very fast,
somo of them making 37 or' 38 knots
and oven touched 42 knots on a
measured mile, while all of them reg
ularly do 35 knots on regular ser
vice. Lying outside' of them aro tho
ubmarlncn of tho D and E typo, tho
latter being seagoing craft of great
radius which aro now making dis
tant unsca voyages to the Baltic and
tho Dardanelles. The smaller D
boats havo tho trim outlines of an
clght-oared racing shell, but the
big now ocean rangers are bb ugly
as some submarine monster, with a
aeol fin running foro and af and a
camel's hump amldship for a deck.
One of tho commanders pointed out
their fine qualities.
"They can Btay under water for
72 hours," he said, "yes, three days,
without any Inconvenience to tho
crew from lack of air. The D boats
are good for runs of 24 hours under
water, but tho E boats mako 72
hours just as easily. During these
long deep water runs they thread
their way through tho Skagerrak or
skirt around Tcnerlffe and past Gl
bralter with as much ease under
water as if afloat.
"The direction and proximity or
distance from land, are all determin
ed with mathematical accuracy by
the science of navigation, and the
steering goes on as easily under
water as above.
There are many famous sea fight
ers among the destroyers, Including
tho Lance, which helped to 'sink the
Koonigln Lulse off Harwich and was
in tho Helgoland battle. In fact, all
these ships had seen battle service
unless they had Just come from tho
yards, and the Arethusa's men were
proud of the fact that she had gone
from the ship yard Into a battle.
"Yes," Bald ono of her officers,
"wo got out of tho yard on a Satur
day; wo were In tho fight Wednesday
and bad sunk a battleship, and we
wero back in the yard again -by next
Saturday. How Is that for a re
cord?" .
LOOT RECOVERED
IN YOUNGSTOWN
CONSISTS OF GREAT VARIETY
OF MERCHANDISE "WORTH
MANY THOUSANDS.
Youngston, O., Jan. 11. Thou
sands of dollars' worth of loot, seiz
ed by rioters In East Youngston dur
ing tho wild scenes of last Friday
night and early Saturday, have been
recovered by the military and police,
and present a collection of almost
everything found tor salo In a small

JAPANESE IN
SOUTH AMERICA
POPULATION OF JAPAN DOUBLES
EVERY THIRTY OR FORTY
YEARS.
MANY SETTLE IN PERU
Festivities At Lima Draw Atten
tion to Their Significant
Progress.
Lima, Peru The festivities of the
Japanese colony in this city on the
occasion of the Mikado's coronation
havo prompted the West Coast Lead
er to discuss at considerable length
the place the Japanese have made
for themselves In this section of
South America, and the larger place
they seem destined to fill In the near
future.
Following the hour of tho corona
tion, a military band played the Jap
anese national anthem In the Zoolog
ical gardens, with the populous Jap
anese colony crowding among the
Dalms under the fluttering banners
of tho Rising Sun. Afterward, there
wero public exhibitions of character
istic Japanese sports wrestling and
fencing the bamboo sticksThe Jap
anese consulate held a reception, and
In the vening a display of fireworks
In the Plaza Zela was followed by, a
dinner given by leading members of
the colony,
The part so far played by the
Japanese on the west coast'of South
America, says the Leader, has been
small compared-wlth the work of the
great occidental nations, but the lit
tle that has been accomplished in re
cent years is significant of larger
things to come.
Tho Toyo Risen Kalsbar tho Jap
anese steamship line, first begun
operating Its vesspls to this 'coast in
1905, and continued on an Irregular
itinerary for threo years. From 1908
to 1910 tho service was suspended,
but was renewed tho latter year and
has sinco been maintained contin
uously with noticeable Improvements
Threo steamers are In service at
present, affording tho only regular
steamship service between west coast
ports, San Francisco, Honolulu and
the far East.
The number of Janpaneso Immi
grants in Peru at present totals more
than 6000, largely workers on the
sugar haciendas along the coast or
merchants In Lima and other cities
and towns. The immigration busi
ness is In tho hands of two Japanese
companies with offices In. this city.
With the more intensive develop
ment of the coast regions of Peru,
and more especially the montana re
gions, It is axiomatic fhat immigra
tion must be called upon to fill up
the huge gaps in population which
today leave by far tho greater part
of the country barren and uninhabit
ed. Where Peru will turn for these Im
migrants remains to be seen, buUit
is a fact worth knowing .that prac
tically tho only foreigners who have
thus far made a success of coloniza
tion 'in tho montana aro the hundred
or more Japanese now settled along
thereaches of tho Madre de Dlos
river In southwestern Peru. Brought
Into the country several years ago
by the now defunct Inca Rubber
Company, they have settled In the
tropical forest regions and solved
the question of the high cost of liv
ing by laying out their small planta
tions along tho rivers and raising
tholr own foodstuffs, rice, sugar cane
and vegetables, On the Madre de
Dlos they have brought tho price of
rlco down from 1 sole--to 15 centa
vos per pound.
It was this high cost of living,
both in tho Peruvian and Brazilian
rubber regions that sounded the,
doom of wild rubber, and all au
thorities on the subject agree that
the renaissance of the Industry de
pends wholly upon the Introduction
of Immigrants who will "go to the
soil" for their food. With vast spaces
la the temperate reglgns of North
America, South America and Aus
tralia still unpeopled, It will be many
years before any great stream of
European Immigrants can be direct
ed Into the tropical and sub-tropical
regions of the Anason basin.
Brazil, therefore, has already turn-
aA tn To nun for tiar aunnlv. and
lboth on the east and west coasts
Japanese are sifting into South Am
erica in increasing numbers.
Discussing tho subject in his book,
"South of Panama," Professor Ross
of tho University of Wisconsin re
calls tho following:
"When, you havo filled up Korea
and Manchuria,' I said to Count Ok
uma in Toklo tho day after the an
nexation of Korea, 'whither will the
increaso of your pcoplo go? Your
population tends to double every 30
or 40 years, and Japan Is crowded.'
Will you not bo obliged to quarrel
with Franco for Indo-Chlna with
England for Australia, or with the
United Statos for the Philippines?'
No replied tho veteran states
man; 'South America, especially the
northern ( part, will furnish ample
room for our surplus."
"Provided that no barrier bo In
terposed," continues Professor Ross,
"to the inflow from man-stifled Asia,
It Is well, within tho bounds of pro
bability that by the qlose of this
century South America will be the
home of 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 of
orientals or the descendants of
orientals! To predict this in 1915 Is
certainly less rash than it would
have been to predict In 1815 that
before tio close of the nineteenth
century a slnglo country in North
America would receive nearly 20,
000,000 of Europeans, and that In
1900 the surviving Immigrants, wlth
thelr descendants, would number
more than 31,000,000! This, how
over, Is precisely what has occurred.
COL. ROOSEVELT
SENDS MESSAGE
TELLS PROGRESSIVE COMMITTEE
WHAT HE BELIEVES COUN
TRY REALLY NEEDB.
Chicago, Jan. 11. A telegram
from Cal. Theodore Roosovelt at to
day's meeting of the Progressive Na
tional committee emphasized the
need of preparedness, not alone In
material ways, but of the. soul and
spirit and declared that the crying
need .Is for a "sound Americanism,
which shall Insist that every man
within our borders shall be an
American and nothing else. "Thor
ough going preparedness," the mes
sage said, Is the best guarantee of
any honorable peace.
When tho National committee met
here today for the purpose of select
ing a time and place for holding tho
national convention, Chicago, where
the birth of the party occurred In
1912 appeared to be the unanimous
choice for the placo for holding the
convention In the week' of Juno 7.
The Republican National convention
will be in session at the same time,
in tho same city.
Progressive party leaders havo
made reservations for 800 hotel
rooms and have options on the audi
torium theater and orchestra hall tor
the week oWune 7. This was dis
closed In connection with the plan
to hold tho party's national conven
tion simultaneously with the Repub
lican convention.
Forty-six of the 48 states aro rep
resented and 150 leaders of the party
are here to attend the committee
meeting and conference. Geo. W.
Perkins, chairman of the executive
commltteo of the Progre3slvo party
who was host last night at a banquet
to members of the commltteo in an
address said-tho leaders of tho Re
publican party are "speechless tn our
country's crisis," and that the Dem
ocratic party has 'utterely failed In
vision, In courage, and in patriot
ism," "
J, W McGrath, secretary to Col.
xRoosevelt, is hero and was in con
ference with party leaders before the
committee wont into session.
EIGHT KILLED BY EXPLOSION

Philadelphia, .Jan. 10. At least
eight' persons aro reported to have
been killed In an explosion at the
Bocher plant of the du Pon( Powder
Company at Carney's Point early to
day, -The steamer Longbeach, which
was Just leaving its dock, was blown
partly out of the water. All Its
windows were broken and part of the
cabin waa smashed! None of the
passengers, however, are believed to
bayo bean hurt. The force of the
explosion was so great tnai u was

CONGRESS NOT
ENTHUSIASTIC
ADMINISTRATION'S ARMY BILL
NOT LOOKED UPON WITH
FAVOR.
WILL BE IHARD TO PASS
Congressmen Find Country Objects
To Forced Military
Training.
Washington, D. C. If the senti
ments expressed in private by in
fluential members of Congress, both
Democrats and Republicans, are a
fair indication of the way the wind
Is blqwlng, tho administration is not
going to have the easiest time put
ting through its preparedness pro
gram. There probably will not be
much difficulty in passing reasonable
navy and fortification bills, but it
will not be a simple matter unless
Indications are decidedly misleading,
to put through the army bill.
iSenators and representatives 'ap
pear unable to arouse enthusiasm over
the proposed continental army, Es
pecially is this true of tho Demo
crats, who are opposed on general
grounds to a large standing army
of any kind or anything that looks
like militarism. Besides entertain
ing decided views on the question
themselves, they have begun to hear
from home the church societies,
farmers' granges -and other groups
are sending In petitions and resolu
tions opposed to the army plans, and
the representatives in Congress are
bound to heed this sentiment from
their states when they come to vote
on the bills. They want to support
the administration, but they appear
outspokenly prepared tp desert the
leaders In 'this phase of the prepared
ness program unless -it Is modified
considerably.
"Most of the members on our side
seem very passive on the whole pro
gram," said one of the leading Dem
ocrats in discussing the situation.
"They seem to bo sorry that the
President has raised tho prepared
ness question at all, but since It has
been raised they want to support
the administration in any reasonable
way. They aro not ready' to go to
extremes, however, and show little
enthusiasm over any of It. I am
speaking of the most of the mem
bers on our side of course there
'are some radicals who would vote
for anything that could be proposed
in the line of military and naval
Increase, and still others, peace-at-any-prlce
men, who go to the other
extreme but the ones who repre
sent the most votes In both houses,
I think, wish the question had never
como up." The member who said
this Is himself In favor of substan
tial navy increases, and also of some
form of strong military system In the
country he is, in fact, an admirer
of the German military system, so he
docs not voice these opinions out
of any desire to find conditions as
ho pictures them.
To put the matter in a nutshell,
a feeling seems to pervade Congress
that the country Is willing to
strengthen the navy and better the
coast defenses but not willing to im
pose military training upon the citi
zens; that the country is willing to
spend a good deal of money, If nec
essary, to buy ships and guns and
mines and munitions tho material
for war but not willing to plant the
seeds of war In the thought of Am
erican boys by Imposing military
training in the schools and colleges.
Buy all the steel and powder and
material things that are necessary,
they say, so long as you leave the
boys alone. The country Is not
ready, they contend, for the Presi
dent's army of 400,000 "disciplined
citizens" proposed In his recent mes
sago the "citizenry trained and ac
customed to the use of arms" ds
proposed in his message, of a year
ago,
The main arguments against tho
army plan, as heard in private con
versations with senators and repre
sentatives during the recess, may; be
summarized about as follows
1, Any approach to militarism in
the United Sfatea Is unpopular-
2. No volunteer citizen army,
scheme would succeed, because tho
men oould not be paid enough to at
tract them from private life. The
first year or two it would succeed
becauso of tho enthusiasm over s
new thing, but after tho novelty
wears off it would fall.
3, The present standing army Is
below tho authorized strength be'
causo the men aro not available. The
army offers no attraction for them
compared with civil life.
4. The country does not need a
largearmy because it Is not approach'
able by a large invading force. Sep
arated from Europe and Asia by two
great oceans, no nation would under'
take to attack the United States' if
protected' by an adequate navy and
coast defenses.
5. Coordination of military forces',
now available standing army, mllf
tla and reserves would bo adequate
police power, and that Is all the
country wants of an army In time of
peace. Useless army posts should be
abolished and troops stationed where
they are needed.
6. A large army would be unnec
essary expense at a time- when the
treasury shows a deficit.
SPECIALIST TELLS HOW
TO FIGHT THE GRD?
Washington, Jan. 10, Assistant
Secretary of Commerce Sweot today"
published suggestions of Dr. Robert
H. Babcock, of Chicago, a noted
blind specialist in heart and lung
diseases, with references to the grip
epidemic which is sweeping over the
country. Dr. Babcock says the germ
that is responsible for the nation
wide illness Is not grip, but a modi
fication or strain ot the pneumonia
germ, and his recommendations fol
low: Keep regular hours, get sufficient
sleep, keep the feet dry and avoid
everything tending to impair the gen
eral health or weaken resistance.
Keep away from people who are
coughing and sneezing. For their
own good as well as the safety of
others they should be Isolated In a
well-ventilated room.
Spray your - nostrils and throat ,
night and morning with a weak aatl- '
septic solution. Borolyptol diluted
.with three parts of water will serve
this purpose and may be used both
as a wash for the nose and gargle
for the throat.
If you get this infection, stay la
bed. Take plenty of bicarbonate of
soda, water and fruit Juices, and do
not go out so long as the infection
persists In nose and throat, or so
long as you have any temperature.
DENVER BREWEfcS OVT QP T
WORK HOLD MASS MtfETYN'O
Denver, Jan. 10. A mass meet
ing and later a demonstration on the
State Capitol grounds was held here
today by several hundred people
representing persons unemployed as
a result of prohibition.
Resolutions were presented Gov,
George A. Carlson by a committee
headed by William Koch, secretary

how many were unemployed and the
naturo ot work desired.
Tho demonstration ended with a
parade. Banners reading: Wet or
dry, wo must have work or we'll
know why," wore carried.
The Denver Labor Council re
