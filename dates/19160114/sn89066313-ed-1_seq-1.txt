Countr weeklies in Missouri devote
insufficient space to the farmer and
his needs, concludul l)r L. L. Bernard
after an investigation by bis class in
rural sociology. The class found
that the average country paper de
votes one-fourth of its reading mat
ter to the farmer, his problems and
his interests. Oni week! papers
were used in the test.
"An examination of forty-seven
country weeklies, as near the date
of January 1 as possible, was made,"
said Doctor Bernard, "and the data
were gathered witli three points in
mind: first, the amount of printid
matter, aside from advertising, in
each paper; second, the amount of
this matter which dealt with rural in
terests of any kind, and third, the
amount of this matter which dealt
with religious, educational, economic
and political problems of the farmer."
It was found that 2."" per cent of
the printed matter of the forty-seven
papers examined was concerned with
some form of rural news, most of
which was obituaries and contribu
tions of rural correspondents. Ap
proximately 7 per cent of the reading
matter of the papers consisted
of stories of rural problems. The ma
jority of these were economic prob-
lems, having to do with better methods
of crop production and stock raising.
The country schools and churches re
ceived some attention from the pa
pers, but politics seemed to have no
place.
"I cannot recall that any of the pa
pers treated political problems of the
farmer," said Doctor Bernard. "We
made the investigation to find out to
what extent the country papers were
appealing to farmers and treating of
their problems. Two of the papers
contained nothing concerning rural
problems. Not enough space is de
voted to the farmer and his needs."
The papers examined came from all
parts of the state. The Nevada Week
1 Post contained the largest amout of
matter, aside from advertising. having
1,118 column inches The Platte
County Argus had the smallest
amount, 231 inches. Of the mat'er
dealing with rural news of any kind,
the Nevada Post led with 2C2 inches,
and the Claton Watchman-Advocate
was a close second with 244 inches.
The Enterprise-Courier of Charleston
had the smallest amount, thirteen
nches. Of the matter dealing with
rural problems the Brookfield Gazette
