MEETING SPIRITED
Much Enthusiasm Evinc
ed at Annual Session
Monday
A. C. Gaillac is new president of
the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce,
succeeding W. C. Mumaw who had
filled the office for three successive
years. Mr. Gaillac was elected by the
new board of trustees last Tuesday
night, T. B. Bruener being elected
vice president. The board of trustees
is composed of John G. Lewis, W. J.
Patterson, S. K. Bowes, P. A. Bert
rand, F. C. Wilcox, J. J. Kaufman, T.
B. Bruener, W. B. Mack. A. L. Daven
port, E. A. Morck, J. T. Elson and
W. C. Mumaw They were elected
Monday night at the annual meeting
of the Chamber.
Mr. Gaillac has been a vital force
in Aberdeen ever since his coming
here, some five years ago. He was
well known here, for many years be
fore that, from his business trips here
from Olympia, his former residence.
Asked by the state government,
some years ago, to codify the insur
ance laws of the state, Mr. Gaillac,
as one of a committee, played a large
part in drawing up the insurance code
as it now stands.
District manager of the Northwestern
Mutual Life Insurance company, Mr.
Gaillac has also devoted time to civ
ic work here and he is a member
of the Aberdeen board of education.
The executive committee to be nam
ed in a few days by President Gail
lac will consist, probably, of seven.
One member, it is sure, will be W.
C. Mumaw as head of a committee
to keep up his work in the farm
movement.
The Chamber, at the Monday meet
ing, chose Congressman Albert John
son as delegate to the National Cham
ber of Commerce, for the meeting in
Washington, D. C., next month, adopt
ed a resolution endorsing national
military preparedness and transacted
other routine business before consid
ering plans for 1916 work.
Retiring President Mumaw called
attention to the work done by the
Chamber toward getting terminal
rates for the Harbor and in the jet
