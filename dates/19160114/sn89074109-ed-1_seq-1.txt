Farmers to Meet in
Fargo February 9
The North Dakota Board of Rail
road Commissioners has called a
conference of farmers and grain
dealers for 9 a. m. Wednesday, Feb
ruary 9, at Fargo, for the discussion
of the question whether a charge
shall be obligatory for stored grain
in elevators. The present law is not
clear as to whether a charge is com
pulsory or not, the statute merely
fixing a maximum charge that may
be made, and as a consequense many
complications have arisen resulting
in charges of discrimination against
some elevator and milling companies
because in some instances they have
been in the habit of charging stor
get the grain.
The railroad commission has re
ceived many letters for and against
the charging of storage and it is to
get at the general consensus of op
inion that this conference has been
called and an intelligent solution of
the matter arrived at, it is hoped
there will be a large attendance of
both farmers and grain men.

Thomson Beleives
in N. Dak.
In an interview with John G. Char
meley, editor of the Mott Spotlight,
George P. Thompson, president of
Thompson Yarls, Inc., says he is in
business in North Dakota and is in
vesting in North Dakota because he
knows North Dakota and Relieves in
its future.
Mr. Thompson is certainly demon
starting that he not only knows
Dakota but he knows its needs. His
company, Thompson Yards, Inc.,
has just set aside $80,000.00 to be
used in financing 200 Northwest far
mers who want silos on their farms.
All the farmers have to do is sign
an application for a silo. These ap
plications can be obtained at any of
the towns where Thompson Yards,
Inc., is in business.
If the application is accepted,
Thompson Yards, Inc., will furnish a
genuine Weyerhauser Silo and erect
it complete with roof, chute and
foundation on the farm. If the silo
should blow down within three years
of the date of erection, the com
pany will reerect the silo without
cost to the farmer. The terms of
that enables the silo to actually pay
for itself.
There are only 200 silos to be fur
nished on this basis. The offer opens
February 1st and closes as soon as
200 applications have 'jeen accept
ed. We expect to see ignite a large
number of these silos erected in this
community. You should attend to
this at once, as the offer may be
withdrawn any day.
COLD WEATHER INTERFERED
WITH MEETING
Bismarck, N. D., Jan. 12.—At a
meeting of the Progressive Republi
can league, held here last night, the
attendance was only normal, due to
the bitter weather. The object of
the meeting was principally to try
to raise funds to pay the deficit of
the 1914 campaign.
Nothing definite or important was
done. Every possible candidate l'or
president had a champion in the
meeting.
The thermometer is forty below
with a stiff breeze today.
The Basket Ball Team will give a
ball at the Opera House tonight.This
team has an enviable reputation for
giving the best of entertainment so
a large crowd and the very best of
everything that goes for a first class
socail evening will be in evidence.

Washington, Jan. 12.—Senator
Thomas, of Colorado* a Democrat,1
charged during the Mexican debate
in the senate that the Standard Oil
Co. on the one htind and the Pearson
Oil syndicate on the other, in rival
efforts to obtain a monopoly of the
oil industry in Mexico, were respon
sible for the revolutions in that
country and had "covered it with
a sea of blood."
Washington, Jan. 12.—Senator
Lawrence T. Sherman, of Illinois,
republican, as soon as the senate as
sembled, introduced a resolution pro-
posing intervention in Mexico by the
er'cttn
Secretary Lansing issued a state
ment in which he said the state de
partment "feels that it took every
possible precaution to prevent Am
ericans from exposing their lives in
a region where guerilla warfare is in
progress, "and that it is to be de
plored that its advice was not fol
lowed."
"Every step will be taken to see
that the prepetrators of this 'das
tardly crime are apprehended and
punished," he said.
Secretary Lansing telegraphed
General Carranza calling for the
prompt punishment of the bandits
who executed 17 Americans near
Chihauhau Monday. Through Vliezo
Arredondo, the newly appointed
Mexican ambassador here it was ar
ranged to bring the bodies from
Chihauhau to Juarez aboard a spe
cial train.
Arredondo jv»piy«,-1 confirmation

Carranza complies with the demand
to protect foreign lives and proper

President Wilson in communica
tion with Secretaries Garrison and
Lansing, soon .issued instructions to
send to the White House all the
facts as rapidly as they are received.
At the White House it was declared
that while something undoubtedly
would be done, what steps the gov
ernment will take have not been de
cided.
All other state department agents
on the border were instructed to
gather all available information on
the executions and forward it to
Washington. At the White House
and also at the state department
there was unconcealed anxiety over
the situation and concern that the
latest outbreak in Mexico might be
made the vehicle for further at
tacks by the opposition in congress
upon the administration's foreign
policy, and its recognition of Car
ranza.
When the house met the storm
broke. Representative Dyer of Mis
souri presented a resolution asking
the president to inform congress if
he did not think the time had arrived
to abandon the "watchful waiting"
policy, invade Mexico and also to
submit to the house the fullest de
tails regarding the dealings of this
government with Carranza.
Other members planned to bring
the subject before the house during
the day if possible.
Defense of the administration's
JJexican policy as well as attacks
upon it were promised.
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 12.—According
to brief messages received here, the
train bearing the Americans was
stopped by the bandits about 50
miles west of Chihauhau City. The
mining men were taken from the
train, robbed, stripped nude and
lined up along the cars for execu

extreme end of the line. As the fir-

"Freckles" is proving still a great

It must not be understood that
"Freckles" is a play essentially with
love motive, because it is not.
There is plenty of action in the
working out of its theme of the kind

The play is great in its simplic

THE ROSARY
At the Opera House on Thursday,
January 20, "The Rosary" a seven
reel Selig Red Seal Play adapted
from the famous work by Edward E.
Rose will be shown. This picture is
one of the best productions ever
made by Colin Campbell, the man
who directed such wonderful photo
plays as "The Spoilers" and "The
Carpet from Bagdad." It revolves
upon the highly dramatic theme
which is so well known to the play
going and novel reading public and
is presented in such an artistic man
ner that all who see it are certain
to marvel at its beauty. The cast
includes such finished players as
Kathryn Williams, Wheeler Oakman,
Charles Clary, Frank Clark and Eu

heart,
Are as a string of pearls to me.
I count them over every one apart,

the stars one by one, twinkle and ap

of the glittering roadway, far down

toil onward and onward as they fol
low the guiding star. Slowly each
star seems to glide into its place un

At the same time the walls of a
rude building vanish in the starlight
and we see as if inside the stable,
the cattle in their stalls and the
Christ-Child lying in the manger.

And there a cross is hung."

State Historic:.! S
S. C. Snodgrass Now
Behind The Bars
S. C. Snodgrass, convicted of one
of the foulest crimes in the history
of Burleigh county, is now a pris
oner at the state penitentiary, where
barring accidents and miscarriages
of justice he will remain for four
long years. He was found guilty ut
the December term of district court
of rape in the second degree, al
though he was charged with a great
er crime, and was sentenced by
Judge Nuessle to four years of pen
al servitude at hard labor. Sheriff
French committing him ot the charge
of Warden Talcott last Friday.
As the result of Snodgrass' crime
the life of a young girl of excellent
family and careful upbringing was
ruined, and her fair name dragged
through the mire, and the wonder is
that a jury was ever permitted to
try the case. But law-abiding citi
zens must bow in submission to the
mandates of the courts^—and take
the chances of pardon boards ex
tending ill-advised clemency to those
beasts in human form, who violate
with impunity every law of man and
God, should the aforesaid beasts fin
ally succeed in breaking into the
penitentiary.—Bismarck Palladium.
Big Convention in
Fargo Jan. 26-30
Fargo, N. D., Jan. 12: Large post
ers and smaller window cards print
ed in four colors will soon be plac
ed in the public places of Beach ad
vertising the Laymeh's Missionary
Convention for North Dakota and
western Minnesota, which will be
held in the Masonic Temple, Fargo,
January 26-28-30. These posters
suggest that "Men are Wanted" for
world service in both home and for
eign fields. The idea of these post
ers was suggested by those used by
the U. S. Army and Navy to induce
men to enlist.
Everything looks bright for a
great convention. Registration Sun
clay in Fargo and Moorhead brought
in excellent results. Five hundred
registered in one day and it is safe
to estimate according to Mr Hatcher
Chairman of the Registration Com
mittee, that the total registration for
Fargo and Moorhead alone will be
between 850 and 1000.
Registrations are coming in most
gratifyingly from outside towns at
the present time. Twenty per cent
of the total registrations is from
outside the two cities. At this rate
it is not too much to estimate the to
tal enrollment as 1300 to 1400.
Too much cannot be said on be
half of the program. Fred B. Fish
er, leader of the team of speakers,
declares that it is the strongest
team of speakers with which he has
ever been associated.

Home of Mr. and Mrs. Chatmaa
Completely Destroyed This
Forenonn-No Insurance
During the fornoon of (Saturday)
this morning a serious fire occurred
at the home of J. Chntinun, on Fair
view Avenue in Beach. Our best in
formation shows that the fire was
started from coals left in ashes that
were thrown out from the dwelling
as refuse. The building and contents
were totally destroyed. The loss is
between six hundred and one thous
and dollars. We understand that
there was not insurance upon either
building or contents.
The Beach fire department prompt
ly responded, as usual, to the call
for aid. Owing to the condition of
the weather and the temperatures
the chemical engine became frozen
sufficiently to affect its effective uso
while on the run to the fire. There
was no opportunty for the fire de
partment to use the water of the
City this was due to the lacking of
about one hundred feet of hose to
reach the conflagration from tha
nearest hydrant. The Chronicle is
pleased to say that the fire depart
ment of Beach is to be complimented
upon its efforts to protect the build
ing and the property of Mr. Chat
man. All persons will, as well as
ourselves deeply sympathise with,
the family upon the loss and the
suffering which must follow from
the destruction of their home at this
season of the year especially under
the present conditions of the weath

TO PRESENT
TO EQUITY PEOPLE

Fargo, Jan.'14, 1916.—Secretary
J. P. Hardy and Traffic Manager F*
O. Gibbs of the Commercial club are
busy preparing a brief setting forth,
the reasons, and giving figures t.f
substantiate them, why the Equity
people should locate their proposed
packing plant in Fargo.
The brief will be a very exhaustive
one and will contain tables showing
the comparative freight rates out o£
Fargo and from other points in the
state. It will be the aim of Mr. Har
dy and Mr. Gibbs to prepare such a
preponderance of evedence in favor
of locating here that the committer
cannot help but see the advantages
that will be gained in so doing.
The committee on the selection of
a site for the new plant will return
to Fanro about Jan. 20. and it is ex
pected that the brief will be ready to
submit to them at that time.
Beach Team Wins Basket Ball Game
From Wibaux Quint.
January 15—
In a fast game on the local floor
last' evening the Beach high school
team out-classed and defeated the
aggregation representing the Wi
baux schools. Both teams played
classy ball and with a little more
practice on the part of the boys that
their team work may be improved,
they will make it interesting for any
team in this part of the state. The
score was 35 to 17 and although it
may suggest something of a walk-a
way there was not a time during
either half when every man didn't
work for all that was in him. The
Wibaux quint are a nice bunch of
fellows and we look forward to some
more interesting games with them
ere basket ball has to give way to
the national game.
