Tennessee Statute
"No tipping" placards greeted
the patrons of barber shops,
cafes, hotels and resturants in
Paris this week, in accordance
with the decision handed down
by the Supreme court declaring
the law constitutional. It was
enacted at the last legislature.
The law provides a penalty of
from $10 to $50 against the pro
prietor of the place who permits
the tip habit a fine for each
offense. It provides that the
waiter, barber, porter, boot
black or other employe be fined
a similar amount in each and
every instance, and imposes a
similar penalty against the guest
or patrons giving the tip.
It further provides a fine of
$100 for each day the owners or
proprietors of these places, in
cluding Pullman cars, dining cars
and railroad station fail to post a
placard warning the public of
the anti-tipping law.
" For the first time in 20 years
the porter in the Caldwell Hotel
barber shop declined a tip Mon
day evening. A Memphis travel
ing salesman dropped a couple
of jitneys into the boy's hand
and went out the door.
"No, suh, boss," yelled the
bootblack, as he pursued the
generous one up " the street.
"Don' you try foh to gib me no
tip."
"Oh, keep it and buy yourself
something," said the Memphis
man.
"I buys myself in jail wid it
'cause theys a hoodoo on dis tip,"
and the porter dropped the coin.

Advertising Value
Clarence M. Phillips, city
editor of the Memphis News
Scimitar, under date of Janu
ary 8, writes to The Parisian
as follows:
"Let me congratulate you
for having one of the livest
weeklies I have ever seen. The
business men of Paris should
come to it strong for there is
no question but that the paper
will be read and read intensely.
There is no doubt but that
snappy news display enhances
the value of the advertisement."
Ain't Morgan Blake
the Nicest Fellow?
We have just glanced over
the Paris Parisian of January
7th date, and for a rural week
ly it is about the livest one we
ever saw. If Eugene Travis,
the present editor, can main
tain this standard during the
year he will be going some.
The paper, in its make-up and
in its well-written and inter
esting stories, has a metropoli
tan tone and backs a good many
dailies we have seen off the
boards; Morgan Blake in the

SPLENDID RECORD IS ATTAINED
BY PARIS POSTOFFICE FOR 1915
Impressions Gleaned Abroad
From Reading The Parisian
. Basing an editorial entitled, "A Sample County," upon
local news contained in The Parisian of last week, the Mem
phis News Scimitar of last Monday commented at length
upon the splendid conditions that obtain in Paris and Henry
county. The editor is Col. Mike W. Connolly, conceded to
be one of the South's greatest writers, and the editorial is
given below:
"We can best prove a general principle by well authen
ticated specific instances, and we can prove the progress and
prosperity of the South generally by particular counties that
have reported. A conspicuous county and a stood sample
county is that of Henry in West Tennessee, because what is
true of this county is true of practically every other .county
in this end of the state. According to a late number of THE
PARISIAN, that concerns itself exclusively with local news
and local affairs, and lets the outside world take care of
itself, Henry county is in a most prosperous condition. The
cotton crop has been disposed of at a good figure, and a
large part of the surplus corn crop has already been sold.
This has brought money into the county and eased matters
up. Besides this, the farmers have an abundance of feed
stuff, which is something very unusual in that section of the
country. But the farmers of Henry county are not depend
ent upon one crop, or upon two crops. Besides raising food
ajtu$3 arid f eedstiiffs anxLcorn and tattoo, -they - haye also
raised large crops of tobacco and hay, which are yet to be
disposed of and which will bring in more money. The year
1914 was a lean year with these good people, and it was with
their neighbors throughout this section, and they were com
pelled to adopt methods of economy that were somewhat un
usual to them. This year all is changed, and when we re
flect that tobacco is the chief money crop of the country, it
will be seen how different is the situation of the people this
year from what it was last year. Bank deposits have in
creased largely, and withdrawals have been ranging high,
which is interpreted by bankers as meaning that people are
not hoarding their money. They are buying goods and pay
ing debts and keeping the money in circulation." A good
deal of money comes into Henry county as a "result of the
shipping out of poultry and eggs, and fruits and garden
truck are assuming considerable proportions. Everybody
feel3 encouraged, and the merchants have done an unprece
dented business. One year ago the farmers had to send
money out of the county and out of the state to pay for feed
for their stock and food for themselves. In many instances
this money had to be borrowed, but not only has this money
been paid back, but the necessity for sending outside of the
county for food no longer exists. As a sample county Hen
ry may be regarded as representing not only West Tennes
see, but, in fact, everywhere within a radius of 150 miles of
Memphis. Certainly our people have cause to rejoice, not
only because plenty and prosperity are theirs, but because
they have learned the secret of living at home, which makes
it possible and easy for them to keep plenty and prosperity
with them all the time."

of Counting and Weighing
the January Mails
' Making a splendid record in
the volume of money order busi
ness, the postoffice at Paris las t
year shot ahead of Clarksville,
crowded Bowling Green and
reached a point of business in
excess of many Tennessee towns.
Postmaster Y. Q. Caldwell,
who completed his 1915 compil
ation of figures this week, stated
that the local postoffice issued
12,659 money orders, aggregat
ing $51,992.66 It cashed 4, 161
orders, aggregating a ,:total of
$18,883.08. ".7 " '
The money orders issued
averaged in point of numbers an
average of four per working day
less than for 1914, but cashed
one more order per working day. ,
These figures aggregate a
money order business for the
year of $70,874.74, exclusive of
the fees to the government for
the service.
The surplus of more than
$30,000 was remitted to a United
States depository.
The greatest per cent of in
crease at the Paris postoffice,
according to Postmaster Cald
well, is that of the postal savings
deposits which consist of individ
ual deposits ranging from 10
cents each to a maxium amount
of $100 in any one calendar
month. The deposits as Bhown
by the report aggregate $5,058.
64 up to January, 1915, as against
$7,949.33 to January 1, 1916.
This is an increase of 37 per cent.
The report of the registrations
and insured parcels will not be
made until the close of the fiscal
year, June 30, next.
The Parisian published three
weeks ago a forecast indicating
that the postal receipts, meaning
stamps and stamped paper,
would amount to a little less
than $12,000, which Postmaster
Caldwell now says is substantial
ly correct, and about the same
as for 1914.
Postmaster Caldwell called at
tention to the fact, in speaking
of the splendid showing, con
sidering the many handicaps,
that practically not a pound of
the 1915 crop of tobacco had
been sold up to January 1, this
year, whereas unusually thous
ands of dollars worth had been
marketed prior to the Christmas
holidays in former years A large
percent of this money passes
through the postoffice one way
or another. Railroad men had
been working shorter hours and
given lay-offs that depleted their
incomes, and other decidedly
unusual conditions had. obtained
