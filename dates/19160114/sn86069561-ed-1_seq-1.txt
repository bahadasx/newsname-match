MEXICAN QUAIL FOR KEN
TUCKY. The first consignment of Mexi
can Bob white quail, secured by
W. K. Brewster for the Kentucky
Game and Fish Commission, will
arrive at New York in a few days
trom Tampico There are 343 iu
the shipment. Executive Agent
J. Q Ward, of Frankfort, said the
birds will be kept in captivity
until the season ot snow is past,
although the birds come from
above the snow line, He made a
"a request throug Senator Beck
ham and Congressman Uantrill to
have the port of entry for next
shipment made either Mobile or
New Orleans. The birds came
trom Hacienda "El Caracol,"
Cruz, Taroalipas. Mr. Brewster
wrote that owing to the disorgan
ized condition of affairs it has
been difficult to get the quail; but
better conditions now prevail and
he expects to secure many more
soon.
GOOD OLD TIMES.
Sez Sam Cox, oez berfcoine:
The 'times ain't like what they
used to be,
When a feller could go with a
ten-cent piece
And get enough bacon for to
grease
The pancake griddle all nice and
neat
And then to have a good chunk
left to eat.
Then butter was fifteen cents a
pound.
And we always had enough to go
'round.
A feller would go with a dollar bill
And a whole blamed grocery ord-
-tjL er fill.
But nowadays for a five bank note
A feller can't get more'n he kin
tote
Right home in the pocket of his
overcoat.
Beats all how fur a fellar could go
On a dollar back forty years or so,
But prices are gettin' so gol durn
high
We'll all eat hay like a boss bime-
by.
Them- good old days we will see no
more
When a man with a dollar could
buy- oat a store,
But there, is one thing that we
must allow,
.There weren't so many dollars as
there are right now.

STANLEY'S GOOD
ROAD POLICY
The Address of Governor A. 0.
Stanley, Before Ky. Asso
ciation, Sept. 15, 1915
COUNTRY MORE ATTRACTIVE
"Back to the Country" Problem Will
Never be Solved Until the Country
is Made More Attractive Build
Roads and You Will Lose None of
the Sweetness of the Farm.
Louisville. Address of Governor A.
Owsley Stanley before the Kentuck
Jood Roads Association, on Septem
ber 15, 1915.
Ladies and Gentlemen: I am
deeply grateful to my good frienfl.
Bob McBryde, for his very kind
reference to me. We should all be
grateful to him for his years of
tireless, patient and unrequited toil
.n behalf of this great movement,
without expecting, without receiving,
any ptber recompense than the grati-
.ude of his countrymen and the wel-
'are of his country. With tongue and
r-en he has presented vith marked
ability every reason which can be as-
:igned for this great wprk,' and he has
mswered every objection which the
gnorant or penurious might advance
The people of Kentucky have yet to
earn the debt they owe this gieat
ournaliBt for a great work nobly done.
I am not here today to attempt to
entertain you witb anything that ap-
iroaches a formal address. I am not
ierf. to make a speech; if I am elected
Governor of Kentucky, my time will
lot be given to saying things, but to
lolng them. (Applause) This is in
ts essence a matter of business as
veil as sentiment, and to the fiscal
ide .of this problem I shall in the
nain address my few remarks.
You cannot build roads, however
.dvisable It may be, without money
To say that you are in favor of good
.oads Is like saying you are in favor
)f good health, or good morals, good
ttmosphere, good looka, or good any
hing else. Nobody not a driveling
ool favors good roads just as he fa
;ors good healtk, or good weather
We all favor good roads who have
Gii8e enough to travel over them
Due question is, not whether it is de
Irable to have better highways Ir
Kentucky, but how we shall obtain
'hem. We all want them if we can
afford them, because we must buy anc
uav for these roads ourselves. Wt
.vill receive some aid from the Fed
aral Government, but the Federal Gov
ernment and the State Governmen
ilike tax the people for the money, sc
it least every dollar that is put it
.jood roads comes directly or indirect
iy out of the pockets of the peoplt
who enjoy them. Then the questioi
'o which an intelligent cltizenshli
should first address itself is, not ahal
we donate, but should we invest th
money toward this good work? II
you go out to get money to build good
roads on the same principle that you
go to get money to educate the Chi
nese, or save the heathen, you will
not b..i'd many miles or road. To get
this rucney, ou must in a way, take
it from the people, with their consent,
by taxation. But the people are not
going to Lix themselves to build the
roads unless thev are convinced that
it is a good i.ivo ment. And when
ever the people find, that they are
mak"ng mt::j ly expending money
ujr:i Jie rotis you will get the monej
just us quickly as )ou would secure it
from a fa-.r.ier ou have convinced
.that he would make money by buyins
n ildltion cf 1,000 acres to his farm
l.t is fcr sal nearby. There is nc
trouble to induce men to spend money
whore th"y are certain or reasonably
oe::i.ih of a safe return. How is the
expenditure of many thousands of dol
'srs for good roads a safe investment?
Mcney and Results.
I am separating It from Its moral
and aesthetic, Its sentimental side. I
m talking to you about the propriety
' expending money for roads as I
ould talk to a farmer atout ,the
spending of money for land. ,,As I
would talk to the manufacturer of the
propriety of spending money for ma
chinery. -As I would talk to the mine
owner for spending money for a tip
ple, or an option upon so many acres
of coal land. A great mistake that
farmers have made is in not making a
business-like calculation as to the cost
of production, which bears a direct
rointtnn to the advisability of con
structing good roads. A short time
ago Charles L. Schwab, former presi
dent of the United States Steel Cor
poration and now president of the
Bethlehem corporation, -the most gift
ed of all the great industrial masters
of finance, made this startling state
ment: "One-third of the cost of the
production of all steel products is the
cause ot transportation," and one of
the secrets of Schwab's phenomenal
success was that he never calculated
the cost of anything made of steel
from a needle to a thousand tons of
armor plates,. that he did not calculate
the cost of laying it down F. O. B.
to the consignee. The farmer does
not calculate. He calculates the cost
of. the production in a rough way, by
taking cost of the land, taxes, labor,
and' tools. When he calculated what
it cost him to get in fifty bushels of
wheat on his wagon or a thousand
bushels of corn in his bin completes
his -calculation. But he has not esti
mated the cost of that article to its
entirety, for no man comes to his bin
tor corn or to the thresher for his
grain. Until he has calculated tne
cost of transportation he has not made
. nn accurate estimate of the cost of
production. What 1b the actual value
of a free public highway? Let us

apiece, $600; the co&t of shoeing and

in the cost of maintaining these horses
at $8,00 a month is 500 a year an
you have to add that to the original
cost. In six years your thousand and
horses and wagon Is gone, as they will
ho worn out. The maintenance will
cost you not less than $600 a year
$2.00 per day. We may say that the
same team will do double the work
over a macadam road as they will do
over a dirt road. So that the farmer

the taking ot their products to tht
market, leaving out the pleasure ot
traveling over the macadam roads to
himself and to his family, leaving out
the advantages to the children in at
tending school, and his family attend
ing church, leaving out the featuret
of bringing him closer to the marke
or to the mill on the basis of dollar.-
and cents, there is no better invest
tnent to the producer than in the mak
ing of a cheap and convenient mean,
of bringing the farmers' commodities
to the market.
But let us take a broader and highei
view. Every man who casts his ballot
in the hope or receiving some pecunia
ry or personal benefit, either in emolu
ments of office or some pecuniary ad
vantage is a menace. By that I mean
that the man who votes simply to
keep up somo political organization,
the man who votes at the call of a
boss, the man who votes for money
In hand is a menace to the liberty of
a free people.
This government rests upon the dis
interested devotion to high ideals of
citizenship. It is the foundation upon
which the republic rests because a
majority absolutely rules in this coun
try. And whenever .that majoritj
ceases to be honest this government
will topple like a house of cards.
What has preserved this govern
ment for a hundred and fifty years or
more? I will tell you: The simple
citizen seated in a cane bottom chair
on a rag carpet before an open fire
place, with a Bible on his knees and
his family grouped about him, his head
bowed simply and reverently asking
God to guide him through the night,
and arising in the fear of that same
God at dawn to take up the simple
tasks of the day. He votes of no
thought of profit to himself, but for
the good of his family and the honor
of his country and the glory of his
God. This is the power upon which
this republic rests and must forever
rest.
Now we talk about this simple Hf,
its high ideals, and its noble purposes,
and yet there Is in Kentucky a con
tinual exodus from the country to the
town. I make no warfare upon tne
city. I have lived in towns the most
of my life, but what I mean to say,
that what we need is more good peo
ple on the farms in the country. It
will cheapen the costs of living in
town. It will bring more customers,
and new life and new capital to our
great cities.
It is an invincible instinct for men
to seek the society of their fellows, to
gather as we have gathered here to
day In great multitudes. It is as na
tural as for partridges to gather in
covies in the field, or birds in flocks
in the sky. It is essential to the hap
piness, the mental and moral welfare
of mankind, just so much as food or
clothing. The thing that has de
stroyed rural life, the thing that has
depopulated fertile lands is the loneli
ness and isolation of life in the coun
try. Our girls and boys who live in
rural districts are literally marooned
In the winter without access to the
postoffice, the church or the school,
or to the doctor In time of sickness,
or to the store for the bare necessi
ties of life in any other way than on
a mule, belly deep in the mire. Our

NOTICE
To the Tax payers of the Town Januar l9t6
of Mt. Vernon: Those who owe
Town Taxes for the year 4i9to,
will make arrangements to settle
boys ami girls simply will not be iept
in the rural districts ten miles from
any town under such conditions, how
ever much ,oti may talk about the no
ble life of the country. It is too often
the most lonesome existence on earth.
If you wish to live in the country and
bring up jour family around you. If
you wish them blessed by the things
which are good and sweet in rural hie.
then you must give them the pleasant
things of life in the city.
Build good roads to the city, yon will
lose none of the seclusion and sweet
ness of the country. The sunshine
and dew and the landscape are still
there, the fertile fields and the low
ing herds, aud the scent of new mown
hay, and the silent benediction of tht
evening are still yours. With good
roads and automobile if you cannot
get an automobile, borrow a Ford
the wife and her boys and girls can
go to church, they can. go to the fair,
they can go to places of amusement,
they have the advantage of the pleas
ures of the city, and you have not been
deprived of your country home or any
thing that makes it desirable or love
ly. You will never solve the question
of "back to the country" until you
have made the country more attrac
tive. You cannot keep your family in
the country with ten or twenty mile-?
of impassable dirt roads between
them and things they want for nine
month in the year.
Increase In Prosperity.
The country will be happier, moro
thickly inhabited if the roads were
Improved, and the city will finally in
crease in prosperity whenever you
unite the two by macadam roads.
Both political parties I am not hero
'o talk politics have condemned the
contract labor system; both parties
have told you that they are in favor
of employing convicts upon the road.
.Vow the counties have the right to
employ whom they please with the
money they raise themselves, ami it
is a vexed question to what extent.

ty, especially, we have an unlimitabe
deposit of rock asphalt, a material
that will cover your macadam roads
with waterproofing a thousand times
more indestructible than oil; a sub
stance, hard, yet elastic, that is aa
enduring as marble. And yet this vast
and priceless deposit today is reached
?nly b.J dirtJ r,oads l?.at are alost
iiiipussiuie. mis is a aisgrace to iven
tucky. I would see, and I hope to
see, the labor of convicts, as well aa
others, employed in the development
of these great quarries, I hope to see
this, the greatest road-making ma
terial ever known, spread over five
thousand miles of boulevard all over
Kentucky from the mountains to Mills
Point.
I could talk to you for a week uaon
this subject. Oh, it means so much
to Kentucky as a state. There is
nuch to expect from the development
of good roads. No other state in this
union has such a variety and a wealth
if undeveloped resources; more coal
than Pennsylvania; more hardwood
than any other commonwealth be
tween the Mississippi and the Pacific,
and more acres of fertile soil than any
other state of like area between the
two oceans. Our soil produces a
greater variety of products than any
other on this earth. Why is it th-it
the wealth of the mountain and tho
wealth of the plain are not developed?
It is because the people of the moun
tains cannot reach the wealth of the
plains, and the people of the plains
cannot avail themselves of the wealth
of the mountains because of the cost
of getting from one to the other.
This is eliminated by connecting
them by great highways. It will in
crease the fertility of the soil and the
richness of the mines and the vast
wealth of the forests.
Upon this great movement rests the
happiness and the prosperity of the
greatest people on earth, the people
who live and expect to die in old Ken
tucky. God bless her.
