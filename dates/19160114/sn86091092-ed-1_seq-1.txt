Wants to Know Why Directors Pur

ing—Directors Elected for Ensu.
ing Year—Only Two Changes
made by the Stockholders.
At the annual meeting of the stock
holders of the Payette-Boise Water
Users' association held in Caldwell
Tuesday, a board of directors for the
ensuing year was elected. The newly
elected members of the board with
the vote each received, is as follows
h J- M a S ee > 61,233; J. H. Keim, 56,
249; E. Jordan, 52,247; J. W. Brandt

41,182; Sam Hunt, 40,018; A. C. John
son, 38,080. J
But two changes were made in the
board of directors. E. Jordan and
V. C. Sparks were elected instead of
R. W. Kingston and E. C. Bradley.
Mr. Kingston failed of election by less
than 6,000 votes, receiving 32,433.
Percy White ranked next with 31,
479. S. L. Kennedy received 24,203
votes. Mr. Bradley's defeat is attri
buted to the fact that lie was sick in
bed and unable to gather votes.
Irrigation District Favored.
The most important business trans
acted, aside from the election of offi
cers, was the adoption of a resolution
to the effect that the association be
converted into an irrigation district.
A warm debate followed the introduc
tion of the resolution. The change to
an irrigation district, in case such a
change is made, will be followed by
far reaching results. Among the ef
fects will be to compel all lands to
pay their share of the cost of the pro
ject in order to get water. Land
owners who are now using waste wa
ter will fight the organization of the
district so it is stated.
The question of disposing of the
Arrowrock railroad would have caus
ed another discussion but the secre
tary of the association stated that a
letter had been received from the
Reclamation Service stating that the
railroad was not for sale.
Graft Charged by Look.
John Look of Caldwell and Fargo
created a sensation when he stated
that a consideration of $5,000.00 was
obtainable for the man who could put
through the sale of certain water
rights. The remarks of Mr. Look
precipitated a furor. Every director
or ex-director of the association who
was present participated in the lively
discussion which followed.
Mr. Look secured the floor during a
temporary lull in the proceedings. He
stated that about two years ago, he
was told by a man whom he named,
that if he would visit a certain office
in Boise he could obtain an offer of
$5000 on consideration that he nego
tiate the sale of the Page & Mott wa
ter rights in the Boise river. Mr. Look
wanted to know if this water right had
been purchased and if so, when, and
who put it through and why the trans
action occurred at a meeting held be
hind closed doors. Mr. Look very
strongly implied that since $5000 was
available somebody must have secured
it.
The Page & Mott water right on the
Boise river above Barberton was pur
chased by the board of directors sev
eral months ago for $20.000.00 in order
that the water it controls might be di
verted into the government reservoirs
between the months of November
and April.
Furor Follows Statement.
The statement by Mr. Look and the
inquires he directed creatcd a furor
anil it was several minutes before or
der could be restored for the discus
sion of the mutter. Applause and vol
leys of questions arising from all parts
of the room made n deafening noise.
Why did the directors think it neces
sary to buy more water when the sea
son of 1915, the driest on record,
showed that the project could store
more water than needed? And why
was the purchase made at a session be
hind closed doors and never made
public? were some of the queries pro->
pounded from the floor. One enthus
iast offered a motion that Secretary
Lane be telegraphed to witluld pay
ment of the twenty thousand dollars
if it had not already been turned over.
In the confusion the motion was not
properly seconded or put to the
house.
Directors on Defense.
One by one the directors were given
opportunity to tell what they knew of
the deal. Director Rankin spoke first,
declaring that he had opposed the
transaction and voted against it. Be
fore taking his seat he fired a hot
shot at some of the government ser
vants, declaring that, contrary to de
partment rules, ditch riders had been
o<ut gathering proxies in an effort to
secure election to the board of direc
tors.
Directors Kingston and Oellien
spoke, the former declaring that he
remembered the deal only in a hazy
manner and thought he voted for the
purchase of another right. Oellien
was the first to defend the board's
action as one of wisdom.
Director Hubbard, seemingly under
the impression that the attack was
directed particularly at him, waxed vu
trolic in his remarks and hurled the
r°w an( * word in the direction
of Mr. Look. The latter was given a
few main en t s to explain and insisted
a 1 h. e h a d no intention of casting
reflections on the integrity of Mr.
Hubbard.
Other directors followed, defending
the purchase as a wise move. The
hour of 3 o'clock, set for the balloting
on directors, arrived, but it was voted
to devote 15 minutes more to the ex
planations. Temporary chairman
Magee was about the last of the direc
tors to take the floor. He asserted
that he also had voted against the
purchase.
Magee Approached.
"Isn't it true that less than a month
after you were elected to the board a
Boise man came to you and asked you
to put through the deal?" Mr. Magee
was asked.
"Yes, sir," replied the presiding offi
cer.
The discussion brought out that the
proposed purchase was voted down
twice, only to be put through at a
third session, when the government's
option on the right was about to ex
pire. It was asserted by one of the
directors that the price asked for the
right was scaled by the sellers from
the fifty thousand dollars first de
manded, to the accepted sum of twen
ty thousand dollars.
Water Users Organize.
Organization of the new board of
the Payette-Boise Water Users' as
sociation was completed at a meeting
held here Tuesday afternoon. G. H.
Keim was named president to suc
ceed J. W. Brandt. C. F. Oellien was
chosen vice president, Sam Hunt was
re-elected treasurer, and W. L. Girard
succeeds himself as secretary.
GUM SHOERS ARE BUSY IN
CALDWELL THIS WEEK
Ordinary ConvicSon Worth $50.00—
Others Worth More.
One of the gum shoers has been
talking. He states that a Caldwell
organization offers a reward of $50.00
for a conviction of bootlegging but
for particular persons rewards of
$250.00 are offered.
Caldwell has three "pink whiskers"
at work in the city. Mr. and Mrs. H.
E. Bradley, alias Hollock, alias Walker
alias Gumbo, have come in from Pay
ette for the purpose of nailing the
bootleggers of which there said to be
23—skiddo—in Caldwell. They are as
sisted by Master Willie Wyengarten.
These interesting guests have been
kept very busy since their arrival. The
bootleggers are olying their trade so
carefully that none have been captur
ed in the act although there is strong
circumstantial evidence in the posses
sion of the gumboots, but this evi
dence is conflicting in some particul
ars and it must be substantiated.
We understand that Mr. Wyen
garten has taken the Rising Star
course and will open a detective
agency in the city after the business
of his present assignment is brought
to a successful conclusion.
PROPRIETOR STAGE LINE
MEETS WITH ACCIDENT
J. A. Wroten Falls Under Moving
Auto Truck at Homedale.
J. A. Wroten, contractor on the
Jordan Valley stage line, met with a
very serious accident at Homedale
Monday. While the automobile, which
is a heavy truck, was moving. Mr.
Wroten attempted to alight. His feet
slipped and he was thrown under the
machine. Both ankles were broken
and one hand so badly mangled that
one finger had to be amputated.
Mr. Wroten was brought to Cald
well at once and placed in the local
hospital. His injuries were attend
ed to by Dr. Farrer. The injured man
is recovering as fast as could be ex
pee'ed.

College of Idaho, leaves the latter

STONE TO BE CANDIDATE
FOR NOMINATION OF
COUNTY ATTORNEY
RUMOR STATES THAT CALD
WELL ATTORNEY WILL BE
CANDIDATE FOR REPUB
LICAN NOMINATION
Sought Nomination Two Years Ago
but Failed by Slender Margin—
Feels Confident of Landing the Of
fice—Well Fitted for Office—Strong
as a Candidate.
Alfred F. Stone, one of Caldwell's
best known lawyers, will be a candi
date for the Republican nomination
for county attorney, according to cur
rent opinion. Mr. Stone is an active,
aggressive young man; a lawyer of
ability; and would make a good
county attorney and a strong candi
date.
Two years ago Mr. Stone was a
candidate at the orimary election and
was defeated for the nomination by a
very small margin by Mr. W. A.
Stone,—one of the oldest and best
known lawyers in Canyon county.
The friends of Mr. Alfred Stone were
greatly pleased with the showing he
made at the primary election. They
feel confident that he will win the
nomination and election this year with
very little trouble.
There is no talk of any other can
didate at the present time. It is
thought that there be no strong op
position to Mr. Stone.
When seen by a representative of
The Tribune Mr. Stone stated that he
considered the matter of running for
the Republican nomination but felt
that it was too early to make anv an
nouncement of his plans. He said:
"Unless something unforseen arises I
will be a candidate for the Republican
nomination. I feel that I can be
nominated and elected. My friends
throughout the county have given me
every encouragement in the world."
Mr. Stone would bring strength to
the Republican ticket.

aemic After Month's Sickness.
Rev. and Mrs. W. S. Hawkes re

December 24 and resulted from per
nicious anaemia after a sickness of

and Sunday school as well as educa
tional circles. She was 36 years of

G,
IAPT. DAVIS FIRES FIRST
GUN II
CAMPAIGN
WILL FIGHT FOR PURIFICA
TION OF POLITICS AND
GOVERNMENT IN STATE
OF IDAHO
Delivers Interesting Address Outlin
ing Position at Nampa—Will Seek
Republican Nomination—Promises
to Reform State Land Board and
Other Affairs of State.
Boise, Jan. 12.—Capt. E. G. Davis
will fire the opening gun of the Re
publican primary campaign at Nam
pa, tonight. He is to speak at the
Episcopal parish house at eight
o'clock this evening, taking as his sub
ject, "The Underlaying Cause of Bad
Government in Idaho," the title imply
ing that there is room for improve
ment in the government of this state.
Evidently the Captain has not been
convinced that the Democratic admin
istration has been an entire success.
The cure-all has not come uo to ex
pectations. Captain Davis is an in
teresting speaker and whatever he
may say in his Nampa speech will
command attention. He is one of the
most thorough men in public life in
the state of Idaho and is master of
any subject that he may attempt to
discuss. He has had exceptional op
portunities of observation, having
been a member of the legislature,
secretary of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee, secretary to Governor
Haines and Assistant Attorney Gen
eral. It is premused that the Captain
will make formal announcement of
his candidacy for the Republican nom
ination for Governor and the platform
upon which he puroposes to stand.
The activities of Captain Davis will
undoubtedly have the effect of spur
ring the other aspirants to action and
we may look for an early and an in
teresting Republican primary cam
paign. Up to this time Senator D. W.
Davis of American Falls has exhibited
the greatest activity, which activity
he must now increase or let his name
sake take the lead. Among the other
presumed aspirants. Lieutenant Gov
ernor Taylor has gone no further than
to declare that in due time he would
make a formal announcement, but that
he was to be considered in the race
until the primaries closed. Nothing
has been heard of Senator Crum fur
ther than that he had the subject of
becoming a candidate under advise
ment. Governor Haines is an inter
ested spectator of what all the others
are doing and seems entirely content
to let the matter rest that way until
next spring.
Van Deusen for State Auditor.
Clarence Van Deusen, candidate for
state auditor on the Progressive ticket
last campaign has been announced as
anxious to make the race for the same
office as a Democrat this year. Mr.
Van Deusen with C. O. Broxon. can
didate for state treasurer, put up the
principal part of the Progressive
campaign fight in 1914. Mr. Broxon
is now one of the official family of
the Democratic governor of the state.
The Democratic contingent of the
Progressive party is losing no time
in getting back to natural affiliations.
Along the same line of political trend,
it is to be noted that the National Pro
gressive party has called its national
convention to meet at the same time
and in the same city as the National
Republican convention. A straight
out, old fashioned fight between the
Democrats and the Republicans seems
certain this year.
Secretary Some Collector.
Automobiles are proving a juicy
source of revenue in the state of Ida
ho. Secretary of State George R.
Barker, reports the collection of $121,
587.00 from that source for the year
1915, as against $58,579.75 in 1914.
Three or four years ago the tax rev
enue from automobiles was an insign
ificant sum. Today this nroperty is
one of the big revenue producers of
the state. It amounts to a sum nearly
equal to one-fourth of the amount of
taxes levied directly by the state for
state purposes, but it is not used for
general expenses. Under the present
law two-thirds of the amount collect
ed goes to the counties for highway
purposes and the other third goes in
to the state highway fund. The auto
owners of the state yap a snug sum
directly for good roads, the total
amount, or $121,587.00 in addition to
their other taxes for similar purposes.
The number of machines registered
in 1915 was 7,699, as against 3,742 in
1914. It is expected that the number
will go to 10,000 this year.
Although the new highway law
doubled the amount of clerical work
in that department of the Secretary of
State's office, without any additional
appropriation to take care of it. Secre
tary Barker has taken care of the in
creased business without any addition
of clerical help. This he was able to
do owing to the efficiency of his as
sistants and the installation of new
systems to cut down the clerical work.
The revenue collected through the
office of the secretary of state is now
one of the big factors in the state's
financial system. The fees, the cor
poration tax, and the automobile li
censes run ud into the hundreds of
thousands, and Secreary Barker con
ducts the office with the same num
ber of assistants that were employed
when the amount of business trans
acted was much less.
David Not a Candidate.
There was a rumor afloat a few
weeks ago that Frank A. David of
Moscow intended to run for Gover
nor. David is a prominent business
man of the University city and has
been a prominent figure in Latah
county politics and the announcement
that he might be a candidate caused
quite a little ripple on the sea of Re
publican politics, but Mr. David now
declares that it was only a joke. The
expression is a happy one in view of
the fact that so many candidates go
on to defeat before they discover that
their candidacy is a joke. In a letter
declaring that he is not a candidate
this year Mr. David throws in the par
enthetical remark that is quite signi
ficant and to the effect that he may
be a candidate two or four years from
now. Frad A. David is a strong man
and it is not at all improbable that he
may some day be governor. If the
truth were known the probabilities are
that the candidacy of David was not
as much of a joke as is now claimed.
At the time an announcement was
made for him, it was not known that
Burton L. 1'rench intended to reenter
the political field in Idaho. In fact
his friends up at Moscow thought he
would not, but when French wants
the right-of-way in Latah county the
tracks have to be cleared for him.
French saw the complications arising
and lost no time in announcing that
he was in the race for Congress, and
his friend Frank A. David lost no time
in getting out of the way.
Had Mr. David entered the race
with the two Davises there would
have been a similarity of names on
the primary ballot that would have
been quite confusing.
SUCCOR CREEK PROTECT TO
BE UNDER WAY BY JUNE 15
Twelve Thousand Five Hundred
Acres to be Supplied with Water.
Guy McGee and assistants returned
Friday from the Succor Creek Irriga
tion district, where they have been for
several weeks running the surveys for
the reservoir, diversion dam and can
al system of that project. Mr. Mc
Gee states that construction work will
be started on the project by June 15.
The first work to be undertaken will
be the erection of the diversion dam
and the construction of the canal sys
tem. The work, in so far as possible,
will be done by the settlers.
The system will reclaim 6500 acres
of land in Idaho and 1.000 acres in
Oregon. Six thousand acre-feet of
water will be supplied to the Gem Ir
rigation District. The water to be
supplied the Gem District will be dur
ing the height of the irrigation season
and thus cut down the electrical peak
of the district and effect a saving of
$18.000 per vear. The preliminary
estimate of the project is $250.000.
The Irrigation System.
The Succor Creek irrigation system
consists of the Gem reservoir which
ill require a rock-fill dam 140 feet
high and will contain 65.0 000 cubic
vards of rock and earth. The reservoir
will impound 32.000 acre-feet of water.
The water is taken down Succor creek
to a point 2 miles above the Wm.
Graff ranch. Here will be erected the
diversion dam. This is a concrete
dam 52 feet high, 162 feet long. Two
canals are taken out at this point, one
for the north side and the other for
the south side.
The system will give the landown
ers a closer and more accessible water
supply. The work that has been done
is preliminary to getting rights-of-way
and getting out estimates and reports
for a bond election which will be he'd
in the irrigation district as soon as
possible.
CANYON STUDENTS TAKE
HONORS AT GEM FAIR
Canyon county boys and girls have
won the Idaho Club Banner for the
second time in two years. This ban
ner is offered for boys' and girls' club
work and the successful county must
compete with the entire state. The
boys' and girls' club work is under
the direction of T. D. Potter and the
exhibits were made at the Idaho State
Fair in Caldwell and afterwards at the
Gem State Fair at Boise.
Delay in making the awards on this
work is due to the fact that crop
yields and the written reports accom
panying them cannot be turned in or
judged until some time after the close
of the fair. Because of the excellent
work of Canyon county bovs in rais
ing corn and potatoes, and of two
girls in canning club work, this coun
ty outdistanced Ada, the nearest com
petitor, in the final summary of
points. Canyon county made 25 and
Ada 20.
Com Growers Win.
A^ first prize won by Marion Ralph
of Kuna on potato records was the on
ly addition to Ada county's credits
since the fair concluded. On the other
hand five Canyon county bovs and
two girls have made points swelling
the total for this county. It was in
connection with corn production par
ticularly that boys of this county out
classed all competitors, winning five
out of six places. On corn reports Joe
Rhodes of Nampa took second and
Wallace Metcalf of Nampa third. On
corn sweepstakes, the three prizes
went respectively to Paul I.ohrman of
Parma, Richard Yose of Fruitland,
and Jesse Williams of Greenleaf, Leta
Symms of Sunny Slope took third
place in canning club sweepstakes and
the Sunny Slope school captured sec
ond on canning club reports.
Remarkable Yield.
Among the noteworthy records is
that of young Lohrman, who grew
127 bushels of corn to the acre at a
cost of less than 18 cents per bushel.
This is the second year that Can
yon county boys and girls have cap
tured the fine $50 banner offered as
the award in this state competition,
and should they win again next year
the banner will become a permanent
possession of the Canyon youths.

MEHODIST CHOIR TO SING
SACRED CANTATA
The first in the series of sacred
cantatas which the Methodist choir
plans to give this winter, will be sung
I'riday night of this week, January
14th, at the Methodist church. The
cantata chosen for this performance
is "The Woman of Samaria," by Ster
noale Bennett, an English composer
of repute. The music, consisting of
chorus and solos, is said to be
very- beautiful, and the full vested
choir of twenty-four voices has been
engaged for several months in pre
paration of the work, which is one of
considerable difficulty. The solo parts
are well taken care of by the choir
members, and the whole performance
