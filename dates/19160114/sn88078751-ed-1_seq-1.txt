Intervention Cry
Of United
Washington, Jan. 13. Tne killing
of fifteen Americans by Mexican
bandits In territory controlled by Car
ranza has apparently brought the
Mexican situation to a crisis.
Members of congress who have re
mained silent for the last two years
throw aside all restraint and de
manded protection for American lives
and property. Sonators admitted
openly on the lloor that they favor in
tervention and war, if that was the
only way in which American citizens
could bo given the protection to which
they were entitled In Mexico.
Two resolutions, one by Senator
Sherman and the other by Congress
man Dypr, were introduced and
referred,' the first, in tho senate,
calling for intervention in the event
of Carranza being unable to furnish
adequate protection for citizens of the
United States, and tho other in tho
fcouBo, calling on the president to In
form congress whether or not in his
opinion the time had come to discard
watchful waiting and take other steps
for tho safeguarding of American
lives in Mexico.
Tho president's Mexican policy was
attacked, being described by Senator
Borah as "a side-stepping, compromis
ing, procrastinating, apologizing, un
American policy."
Gr..n.lr. Gtrtna llrcrorl nntr-fntlp. Rllll-
port of Hie president and patient for-1
bearance until the experiment of try
ing nut the Carranza government I
should proVo a failure. Senator Thom
as, Democrat, of Colorado, also ad
vised against intervention, except as
an unavoidable Tesort, declaring that
tho United States never would get out
of Mexico if its armies crossed the
Rio Grande.
Upon the receipt of the confirma
tion of tho massacre the state depart
ment sent representations to Car
ranza requesting him to order the Im
mediate ..pursuit, capture and punish
ment of the perpetrators of the "das
tardly crime" and strongly urging bet
ter protection for foreigners in the
mining district of Chihuahua. Mr.
Lansing issued a statement which,
though referring to the murder of the
Americans as a "dastardly crime,"
laid partial blame on tho victims
themselves as having disregarded
wanting to keep out of the territory
which the Vllllsta bandita are" operat
ing. Mr. Lansing denied that the state
department "u.ad obtained safe conduct
for the Americans or had issued pass
ports to them.
Intervention Not Likely.
Insistence at the capltol on armed
intervention in Mexico as a. result of
the massacre 'ound no responso at
the state department or Whlto House.
No orders have been given looking to
a movement on the part of tho Ameri
can border forces or a concentration
cf the naval forces off the Mexican
coastB.
At tho same time army officers in
fbe war department apprehend possi
ble trouble on the part of tho people
in Texas aW other border states
when tho bodies of the slain Ameri
cans aro brought across the border.
Where these bodies now aro tho state
department has not been advised.
As given out by Secretary Lansing,
tho official text of the representations
sent to Carranza through Consul Sllli
roan at Queretaro were as follows:

since last spring by blackmailing
wealthy violators of tho Mann white
slave law were given out by agents
of the department of Justice, who for
eIx months lmve been striving to get
evidence that would enable them to
put the crooks In jail. The reluctance
of men and women to give testimony
that would wreck their reputations
has been an insurmountable obstacle
to prosecution. The best hotels of

easiest scheme of blackmailing that

SERIOUS MOVE IN ENGLAND
Resolution For National Strike
Against Enforcement of the Mili
tary Service Bill to Be Submitted to
a Referendum Compulsion Meas
ure Passes Its Second Reading In
the House of Commons.
London, Jan. 13. Tho most serious
nove yet contemplated in opposition
to conscription was made by the ex
ecutive committee of the Miners' Fed
eration, the strongest union In the
United Kingdom, when by a vote of
2 to 1 it decided to submit to a refer
endum of the miners a resolution for
a national strike against the enforce
ment of the military service bill. Such
ft strike would mean the crippling o!
tho British fleet, munitions factories
and railroads.
Together with news of this action
came word that the Welsh Federation
of Coal Miners by a vote or 162 to S3
had adopted a resolution in favor of
a walkout of miners in England, Scot
land and Wales In case the military
service bill were passed, and that a
resolution condemning conscription
had been passed by South Wales coal
miners In Cardiff, 211 to 35.
The Welsh miners have always
teen opposed to conscription as a
rrlnclple and have threatened a gen
eral strike before.
Bill Passes Second Reading.
The compulsory military service
bill passed its second reading in the
house of commons by a vote of 431
to 39. Tho withdrawal of the Irish
Nationalist party and a few scatter
ing additional votes from the opposi
tion made the difference in the count
from that of 403 to 105 on the division
on the first reading.
At the same time a victory for the
conscriptlonists in the Labor party
was made known with the announce
ment of the withdrawal of tha resig
nations of Its three members in .the
ministry. These are Arthur Hender
son, president of the board of educa
tion; William Brace, parliamentary
undersecretary for home affairs, and
George W. Roberts, lord commoner of
the treasury.
Premier Asquith hod hoped that the
bill might pass Its second reading by
assent, but the effort failed.

Corfu Review of Operations.
London, Jan.. 13. With the capture
by Austrlans of Mount Lovcen, the
Montenegrin strongacld, Cettlnje now
seems likely to suffer the fate of Bel
grade. Fighting Is going on all around
Cettlnje, the small town which nearly
a year ago ceased to be the seat of
the Montenegrin government, and
there seems little hope that It can
long withstand the overwhelming
strength of General Koevess in men
and guns.
British observers are already ask
ing anxiously what menace the Aus
trian conquest of Montenegro Is like
ly to hold over the allies at Salonica
As in Serbia's case, the entente press
finds it inexplicable why Italian as
sistance was not sent long ago t
Lovcen, which. It is said, could have
been rendered Impregnable, with a.
comparatively small number of rein
forcements and a few heavy gucs..
The reduction of Montenegro, tho
press points out, will enable Austria,
cot only to command' the Adriatic,
but also threaten the flank of any ad--vance
from Salonica and prevent any
effective move of the entente forces
through Albania.
For Italj- the new Austrian succets
hos a most serious aspect. The lon,r
narrow Italian peninsula 13 peculiarly
vulnerable to an attack from the sea.
Any really great Austrian naval base
in the magnificent harbor of Cattaro
would have been impossible without:
Lovcen, but under the new circum
stances 'Austrian possession of Cat
taro Is almost as great a menace to
Italy as the German conquest of Ca
lais would have been to Great Britain.
On the Russian front, the Austrian
official communication records renew
ed desperate attacks by the Russians
on the Bessarablan frontier, but in
sists that the attacks everywhere
vero repulsed. The Petrograd com
munication Is silent on the subject.
A French detachment has been
landed on the Greek Island of Corfu;
for provisional occupation, according
to an Athens dispatch. Fourteen?
ships of unknown nationality arer
cruising around Corfu.
