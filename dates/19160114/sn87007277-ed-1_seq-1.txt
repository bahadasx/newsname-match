WIN OR LOSE KAHANAMOKU WEARS SMILE AD WOLGAST MOVES ON
AUSTRIAN FIELD HOSPITAL IN RUSSIA
Never Take Part in Another
Serious Encounter.
Ring Never Had Flashier Career In It
History Than That Shown by
Cadillac Boy Never Ranked
as Popular Champion.
Wolgast has moved on. He says be
never will don another pair of boxing
gloves (or a serious encounter In the
ring and doubts very much whether
he will ever be induced to even look
at -the modern tools of ring warfare
again. Yet he is only twenty-seven
years old.
The ring never had a flashier career
in its history than that shown by Wol
gast. He started battling in 1906, was
a sensation out on the Pacific coast
in 1908, became lightweight cham
pion of the world by defeating Bat
tling Nelson on February 22, 1910,
twice broke his arm on mediocre op
ponents, suffered an attack of appen
dicitis and went through an operation
and then lost his title to Willie Ritchie
on a foul on November 28, 1912.
Despite the fact that Wolgast must
be tabbed as one of the world's great
est fighting machines he always had a
tough time getting any sort of recog
nition. Perhaps it was an indifferent
personality and the fact that he
whipped one of the country's idols In
order to gain pre-eminence in his class

WHAT WAR IS LIKE
Duke Kahanamoku, Greatest of Swimmers.
"The biggest thing In sport? It Is
the heart to accept defeat gracefully."
The Duke Kahanamoku, greatest of
swimmers, has just been beaten, to
gether with his teammates, in the
grueling 300-yard exposition relay
awim at San Francisco by the Illinois
Athletic club.
His smile and unstinted praise for
the victors gave his words a personal
application. "The duke" knows how
to lose as well as to win.

meet who grumbled and protested

the big Kanaka world's champion
from the South seas.
'The man who mopes when he's
beaten," said kahanamoku, "shows
something in his make-up which will
f usually prevent him from winning
high honors. He's not a sportsman
A man's got to keep cheerful to be
a victor.
It is particularly necessary that
the youngsters who expect to make
records keep that in mind not to
feel bitter over defeat Keep smiling
and trying, A smile develops en
ergy."

Eddie Plank, Now Forty-One Years
Old, Is Pitching Sensation of
the Federal League.
Scddie Plank, according to some of
he baseball experts, deserves tne
Hie of the "greatest left-handed
pitcher" that ever lived.
For 15 years, 1901 to 1914, the won
terful southpaw was the Mack main
stay. For 15 years he pitched the kind
)f baseball that helped the Athletics
;o win a large flock of pennants and a
lumber of world champion titles.
And now, in his forty-first year, and
Ills sixteenth in baseball, he is the
bitching sensation of the Federal
league. Cast adrift by his old boss,

sters who swam as the duke's team
mates are following his precepts.

Kaupiko, Lane and Kreuger; they
know how to lose and smile, how to
win without braggadocio.
Kahanamoku, who won the 50-yard
dash, the 220-yard and the 100-yard
dash in the exposition meet, believes
that be gets a good deal of his phe
nomenal sprinting power by keeping
his body lower in the water than most
of the crack American short-distance
men.
'I have observed," he said, "that
many of your fastest swimmers here
use their feet on the surface, splash
ing a great deal. I, on the contrary,
keep my feet underneath. I believe
that gives me much more driving
force in the crawl stroke. No energy
is wasted."
Not content with his wonderful
Bwimming prowess, the holder of the
world's 50-yard and 100-yard records
is now going In for sculling, tennis
and baseball, not alone to satisfy his
own ambitions, but to lend his Influ

young men.
and the weakness of the batters who
face him, as he did in the American
league. He must learn as he goes. He
must pit the old southpaw whip, abso
lutely unaided, against the Federal
league clouters. And he has done bo
successfully.
Plank is one of the very few left
handers who has no eccentricities. He
has been normal in his conduct, a
gentleman on the ball field and off,
and all through the 16 years of his
major league career he has graced the
game by his presence.

Mathewson Gets Much Amuse

When a man is a star at any sport
you can wager your last rupee that
he gets a hale of fun out of his play,

A ball game to Ty Cobb Is a picnic.
Mathewson has been in professional
baseball for fifteen yenrs, and yet he
gets as much fun out of a game today

"It will be the toughest day of my
life," said Matty recently, "when

This rule is general, but not with
out exceptions. Jim Thorpe was one
of the greatest football players that
ever lived if not actually the great
est tor all around value. Yet Thorpe
was never keen over football as
sport. He told us one day that he
would rather play baseball for a week
than to play rootoau for a year. If
Thorpe had only started baseball
when a kid he would have been an
other Cobb, to employ a highly orig
inal phrase. But he was over twenty
five before he ever gave the summer
game any serious attention.

that brought about the conditions for
the little German. Perhaps it was a
noisy manager. At any rate he never
was a popular champion, even in the
face of sterling fighting qualities.
Like most men of his slipshod busi
ness methods, Ad was lacking in an
appreciation of the valuo of phys
ical conservation. He liked the bright
lights as well as anybody and seldom
turned down genial companionship.
But he wasn't slipshod when it came
to providing for the future for him
self and his family. They will never
have to give the former champion anj

WHY SINCLAIR IS ADMIRED
According to a story going the J
rounds, Garry Herrmann, chair- t
man of the National commission,
and Harry Sinclair, Federal
league "angel" and Oklahoma
oil magnate, elbowed each other ;
trying to pay the check in the J
Ritz-Carleton at Philadelphia t
after the recent "peace confer-
ence." I
"It's on me, take It out of
this," said Garry, flourishing a J
brand-new century note.
"This way, waiter, that other
gentleman's money Is counter- ;
felt," said Sinclair, waving a $50 I
bin. :
The waiter was kind enough to !
permit Herrmann to pay the
"freight." Sinclair tossed his $60
bote at the waiter, saying:
"If I can't buy I can do the tip- I
Ping."
Perhaps it Is this trait on the
part of Mr. Sinclair that makes
certain newspaper men we know ;
so anxious to have him remain !

London. The following letter was
written by a British army officer in
France to his nine-year-old son, who
had asked his father what a real bat
tle line was like:
"My Dear Brian You would like to
know what a real battle line is like. In
the distance you see a hill and on the
right some woods. Some farmhouses,
one or two still intact, and others
mere heaps of brick, lie dotted about.
Near you on the right is a battery
hidden under bushes and earthworks.
Nearer you still are dugouts In which
the men live underground.
"In the distance is a German an
chored balloon watching the country.
On the right and overhead is an aeroplane.
"Beyond the hill and the woods are
the trenches In which the Infantry face
the German infantry, also in trenches,
Somewhere near the trenches, and
where they can see them well and the
country on tho German side, are the
artillery observation officers, who tele
phone directions to the batteries and
direct their fire where they want. All
this Is done very accurately on a spe
cial system called registration, by
which having once hit a target you
can always go on bitting It or anything
near it.
"For Instance, yesterday when 1 was
directing the battery at one of these
places a German put up a tin on a pole
and waved tt about in the air in his
trench. I saw this, told one gunner
what angle to lay at and the range, and
the next moment the shell arrived and
the tin went up in the air. What hap
pened in the trench I don't know, but
the shell burst in It. One burst In ours
this morning and killed one man and
wounded two others. So they can do
damage.
"The trenches are very lively placos
at night when a lot of rifle fire is al
ways going on, and one side or the
other sends out patrols or snipers -to
peep over the other's trenches and
shoot men; and the trench mortars get
busy and send over high-explosive
bombs, or someone more daring than
others crawls out and throws hand
grenades into the trench.
"Behind these front trenches are
other trenches, which lead in a zig-zag
BIRD DROPS INTO MACHINE
way to the front, or hold more men
ready to help if tho front trench Is at
tacked. This is really the nastiest
place to be in, because the German ar
tillery are always ready to shoot at
them, and do shoot at them when there
Is any excitement.
"Hidden all along the trenches are
machine guns, which fire flank-wise
and are very destructive. Then come
the artillery, and behind them again
the big guns the very big ones which
drop shells a tremendous distance and
blow blocks of houses to bits. They
say one of ours not long ago dropped
a big shell into the middle of an In
fantry regiment a German one and
blew 500 of them into little bits. Dot
ted about around the country where
they are most needed are the antiair
craft guns, whose shooting at 'birds
as they call the aeronlanes. is verv
pntty and very bad.
"Away back behind all these are the
aerodromes and captive balloons of
our own watching the front, where all
the roads are busy with motor trans
ports feedings the firing line with grub
and ammunition. You would never
think how many men and how much
transport are necessary to do all this
properly.
A battle starts with terrific artil
lery bombardment, sometimes for days,
and when the enemy's trenches are ab
solutely destroyed and their men dazed
with the rain of high explosives and
gas and bombs the infantry charge
across.
Sometimes the machine guns
haven't been knocked out and they
take a big toll of life, and always
there are plenty of men whom the
bombardment fails to knock out
"There is never a soul to be seen.
There is only a terrible roar of guns
and explosions, and the perpetual
snapping of rifles and rattle of ma
chine guns. There is a view of some
broken walls, trees without leaves or
branches, and trenches everywhere
"You would think there was no life
anywhere if it were not for the row,
and yet one knows that If you put up
a head a thousand eyes will see it and
half a thousand fingers pull a trig
ger.
"It is all very destructive, very cost
ly and very useless, war, but It brings
out all that Is best in men. No doubt
it is for a good purpose which we do
not realize at present, when we only
see the ruin and the killing and the
waste.
"Sometimes the world wants cleaa
Ing like the pistons of a motor to
make it run smoothly, and this Is the
way it comes about. You boys later
on will reap the benefit of it all."
