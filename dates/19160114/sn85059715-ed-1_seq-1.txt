Speculation is Rife as to the
Attitude Italy Has Adopted
as to the Invasion.
SALOIMIKI ls~ STILL SAFE I
Offensive of the Teutonic Allies
against the Allies Does Not
Materialize.
(AY ASSOCIATED SASSS)
LONDON, Jan. 14.?It is authoritatively
announced today that the reported
offensive of the Teutonic allies
against Saloniki did not occur.
The rumors that the attack had been
begun against the forces of the Allies
apparently originated in the activity
of the French in blowing up the
bridges connecting Paloniki with the ,
road over which the attackers would
normally travel. Bridges were destroyed
by the French not only at
Dcmir Hissar on the Struma, in the
neighborhood of Serres, but also at |
Killinder, south of Doiran. All the I
bridges destroyed were in Greek territory.
the rumors that Austria and
Montenegro has suspended hostilities
for the purpose of discussing arrange-1
Montenegrin soil should be stopped
may be based simply on the fact that
the Austrian advance in Montenegro
has become so slow that
suspicion of a suspension of hostilitlesls
naturally aroused. Many military
critics, however, are of the
opinion that Montenegro is now In
such a position that some form of arrangements
with its adversary has become
imperative.
Speculation is rife us to the attitude
which Italy has adopted with
regard to the invasion of Montenegro
by the Austrlans. which constitutes a
grave menace to Italian interests. The
fact that Italy's superior fleet did not
prevent an Austrian squadron from
assisting in the reduction of Mount
Lovcen .which dominates the harbor
of Cattaro, Is h"!nt; commented upon
though experts admit that there Is
not a sufficient oasis of Information
from which to draw deductions in the
ma er and they suggest that Italy's
attion In the present juncture should
^ he awaited before Judgment is passed
B on a that net I rin would be Li utu rally
kept secret as long as possible. 1
News of the development In the
military operations in Galicia and
Bessarbia Is awaited with much in- j
torcsst here and it is observed that
both sides are unusually reticent with
regard to tiie operations. Austria
usually sends out the first information
on the military activities in that
region, but beyond a general review I
of the ltussian offensive movement,
it gives today but little light on the j
happenings on its eastern front.

Seumas MacManus Delights
Audience with His Famous
Lecture.
11
More than 300 persons heard Seumas 1
-MacManus deliver hiH famous lecture,
"A Merry Ramble Round Ireland," at
the St .Mary's auditorium Thursday [
night. The lecture was Illustrated
with colored stercoptlcan views, which
portrayed all the beauties of the land j t
of the Shamrock.
The audience was not composed en-1
tlrely of persons of Irish descent,,'
there being many others, who, having,1
delighted in reading his poems and
stories, wanted to hear MacManus 1
himself. All who attended were highly I:
pleased with the lecture, and they are
today voicing the praises of the lecturer
and writer.
In his characteristic manner, Mac- :
Manus Thursday night told his audience
of the beauties of his native
land, of Its folk lore and of the Irish
statesmen, whose names are honored
and cherished in every Irish and'
American home.
MacMantis is a very pleasing and
forceful speaker, and his lecture even ,
surpassed the expectations of those .
who heard him. lie was just bubbling
over with the characteristic Irish wit'
and humor, and his audience was kept i
In an uproar of laughter a great part ,
of the time.
An elaborate banquet was given
following the lecture In the basement
of the St. Mary's high school. The
affair was given by Sarslleld Division ;
No. 1, Ancient Order of Hibernians,
In honor of Seumas MncManus. At-,
torney J. Philip Clifford was the;
toastmaster and In his usual witty
manner he introduced the speakers.
The speakers were Judge James
W. Robinson, Attorney W. H. Taylor,
Attorney I.ouls A. Johnson, Percy .1
Byrd and P. II. Shields. Each speaker
reviewed briefly the history of tnc 1
irlRh?of the characteristics of the
Irish people as a race?how they have
contributed to the upbuilding of clvllUntion,
and of the part they are now ,
taking in promoting the general prog-1
resa and welfare of Ireland and America.
SeumaB MacManua, the honor
guest told one of his humorous ntorles
and reeited one of his Irish poems
much to the delight of those pres-;
ent.
"I am proud of the fact that I am
Irish," said Percy Byrd, "I am sure
that 'Jim' Robinson and Sherman;
Denham would be better politicians
If they were Irish." Thoreupon Mr. I
Denham arose and stated that he was
of Irish descent, as bis grandmother |
came "direct from Ireland."
