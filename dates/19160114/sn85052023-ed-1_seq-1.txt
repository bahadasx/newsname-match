The
METEOR SEEN AT
AN EARLY HOUR
,Lights Up Sky As It Flashes Across
Heavens About DaWn Wednes
day Many Saw It
The meteor which flashed across
he sky at an early hour Wednes
day morning was plainly seen by a
number of Lincoln county people
who happened to be up as early as
half past five o'clock. The first to
make report to the I. J. was Coun
cilman E. L. Reinhart, who saw it
as he was delivering the morning
papers on Danville avenue. He said
Vnat it lighted up the heavens as it
soared from northeast to northwest.
Mr. Reinhart says that Doc Huffman
and his brothers on Danville pike
aw it and thought a German airship
was dropping a bomb. Will Chance
Id", on the Crab Orchard pike, saw
it and believed that it struck the
earth a short distance from his
home.
A man near H. K. Codey in Scott
county, claims to have discovered
part of the meteor in a ravine near
his farm. Dispatches from Cincin
cinnati say that it was vividly seen
in that section and that a loud explo
son was heard soon after the meteor
appeared to strike the ground.
Quite a number of superstitious
and ignorant thought that the end
of the world was at hand. A great
many people everywhere saw the un
canny visitor and it was generally
recognized as a common phenomenon
and regarded with curiosity rather
than fear. The Weather Bureau at
Louisville mads the following state
ment about the matter:
"More or less, all space is filled
-with material thrown off by stars
and other bodies. When particles of
this material reach our atmosphere
thev burn with light more or less
brilliant and are thus called to ours
notice. They are composed of mat
ter of the same kinds found in our
earth which becomes fused in our
atmosphere and a preponderance of
magnetic iron usually is left.
"The bodies may be of trifling
size or as large as a table, a jlesk or
-half a house. The one that caused'
such excitement Wednesday morn
ing probably came pretty close to us
from what I have heard of its bril
liancy, and maybe struck somewhere
within a radius of 50 miles of Louis
ville but that is a pretty big area
in which to find thing even as big
as a house. Meteors are flying thro'
space all the time, but only when
they reach our atmosphere and burn
are we aware of them."
OVERTURNED IN BUGGY.
David Rankin, Frank Higgins and
Ben Dunn, of the Marksbury section
of Garrard, while returning home on
a dark night last week, drove over a
high embankment and turned their
buggy over. The horse ran away and
the occupants were dragged some
distance before he could be stopped.
Luickly they were only slightly hurt
and the buggy was not damaged.

. .. ygss
'
B. D. Carter.
Chief Carter, who has just been
re-elected for another term by the
Stanford City Council, is one of the
best known peace officers up in this
end of the state. He has made a
splendid record since being at the
head of Stanford's police department
being fearless in the performance of
his duty and a tireless worker. Chief
Carter fills well a place that is one
of the hardest in the world in which
to please everyone, and the longer he
is in office the more friends and ad
mirers he makes. He is just now
barely able to be out after a serious
fall while leading the fight to save
the home of a well known citizen
from destruction by fire a few nights
ago. There's nothing the Chief will
not do to help a friend, and this fact
that he can. always be relied on, is
one of the reasons for his popularity.

QUIZZING BANKRUPT SANDERS
A ttlppfintr rf thp criKiifnrs nf T.
L. Sanders, bankrupt, of Crab Or
chard, was held before Referee in
Bankruptcy Nelson D. Rodes, of
Danville, here Wednesday afternoon.
Mr. Sanders was placed on the stand
and was put through a vigorous ex
amination by Attorneys John Sam
Owsley, of this city, and John W.
Brown, of Mt. Vernon, representing
several of the largest creditors. The
bankrupt merchant was quizzed par
ticularly concerning notes given by
him to his brothers and relatives and
which he had not listed among "his
schedule of liabilities, and which,
also he is alleged to have failed to
list as owing by him in making a
statement to Dunn and Bradstreet,
and also in statement of his business
assets "and liabilities given . certain
wholesale houses when obtaining
goods from them on credit. Attorney
Brown asked Sanders if it was not
a fact that these notes had been
made out to his relatives since he
had taken the bankrupt law, but Mr.
Sanders vigorously denied this.
AFTER AUTOISTS IN tfANVILLE
Several Stanford autoists who so
far have failed to obtain their 1916
licenses, caught it heavy in Danville
this week, when thev were arrested
by Chief of Police George T. Thur
mond and assistant A. C. Alford. The
number included the colored driver
for Phillips Bros., who was piloting
the big motor truck of J. H. Baugh
man & Co., of this city. Licenses
for this machine had arrived but had
not been put on so the case was con
tinued. O. L. Minks, who runs the
auto line between Danille and this
city, was arrested when he had his
new licenses in the car but had not
stopped to put them on. He says he
ordered them from Frankfort on
Dec. 29 but they did not arrive un
til Jan. 10th, and he was arrested as
he got them from the postoffice. He
will fight the case. A large number
of fines are being paid and all motor
ists are being warned to get their
new tags before they go to Danville.

Mr. and Mrs. James R. Beazley are
making their home. So he will have
pleasant surroundings and home-like

money in improving her road sys
tem. The chief cities of the state
are engaged in advertising Florida
as a place for investors as well as
winter tourists and the country

basis that will insure permanency.
M'GUFFIE SQUARES THINGS
W. E. McGuffie, of Waynesburg,

where the charges against him of
giving checks when He had no funds
to meet them, were dismissed. Mr.
McGuffie has made full reparation to
all concerned in the matter. He was
here Monday and said that he has
secured sufficient funds to pay every
dollar he owes and will do so as fast
as he can. He and his family are
preparing to go to Michigan soon to
make their home. Mr. McGuffie ha.
secured a good position there, and
his friends here hope that he will
make good. He has showed that he
desires to do the right thing with
those to whom he was indebted.
VACANCY ON SCHOOL BOARD
The election of Dr! W. B. O'Ban
non as a member of the Stanford
City Council, causes a vacancy on
the local Board of Education, which
must be filled by the other members
of the board until the time for a reg
ular election rolls around in May.
Dr. O'Bannon has been an honored
and efficient member of the school
board for a number of years and the
members are weighing a number of
names carefully in order to obtain
a man to fill the vacancy who will
give the same careful consideration
to local school matters and interests
that Dr. O'Bannon has done.
SIX-YEAR-OLD HAD CROUP.

croup," writes W. E. Curry, Evans

COMMITTEE
ASSIGNMENTS
Of Senator Montgomery and Repre

Representative W. G. Gooch, of
Lincoln county, and Senator Charles
Montgomery, of Liberty, represent
ing this district, in the upper house
of the legislature, were both given
good committee assignments by the
presiding officers of the two houses.
Mr. Gooch was made chairman of the
Committee on Public Monuments and
Historical Records, while Senator
Montgomery is chairman of the iom
mittee on Penal and Reformatory n
stitutions, an important body whic'i
Will hear any matters affecting the
state peniteniaries or reform school.
Senator Montgomery's other commit
tees are: Appropriations, Constitu
tional Amendments, Game, Fish and
Forestry, Common Carriers and
Commerce.
In addition to his chairmanship,
Representative Gooch was placed on

Mr. Gooch rather busy.
Representative H. Clay Kauffman,
of Garrard, was given the chairman
ship of a very important committee,
that of Kentucky Statutes. His other
committees are Court of Appeals.
Circuit Courts, Codes of Practice,
Judiciary. Representatie Claude Mi
nor, of Boyle county, was given the
important post of Chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, and
will be "watchdog of the treasury"
as far as the house is concerned. Mr.
Minor's other committees are: Banks
and Banking, Cities of the Fifth and
Sixth classes, Public Utilties, Rev
enue and Taxation.
Among the first bills to be intro
duced were bHls to submit a vote on
state-wide prohibition to the people
of the state. The bill was introduced
in the senate by Senator W. A. Frost
of Graves county and in the house by
Representative L. B. Hamilton, of
Franklin county. It is a rather
strange irony of fate that the repre
sentative from the county in which
Col. E. H. Tayloi-, the world famous
distiller lives, should offer a bill for
state-wide prohibition. The secret
of the matter is, however, that Col.
Taylor and his political henchmen
were so busy trying to carry Frank
lin county for Stanley in the govern
or's race that they inadvertently let
a state-wide candidate for the legis
lature win. Both of these bills will
be against the hardest kind of sled
ding at this session. The house put
into effect a set of gag rules, requir
ing a two-thirds vote of the members
to suspend the rules, wnile the last
house only required a majority vote.
This rule was put on to make it all
the harder for any sort of anti-liquor
legislation to see ihe light of day. A
lot of mighty good men were per
suaded to vote for the rule for some
reason or other. Representative L.
Merriwether Smith, of Mercer coun
ty was one of the few who saw the
"nigger in the woodpile" and made
a fight against such a gag rule, but
he lost out as the cards were stacked.
The state senate has asked the at
torney general's office for a state
ment regarding the suit to recover
$62,988 from the State Board of
Health, alleged to have been ille
gally spent.
