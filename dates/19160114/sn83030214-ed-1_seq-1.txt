Bernstorff Is Now Pilot
of Wilson's Diplomacy
M?a Move Gin Make or Break President?And He
Plans to Steer Straight for Crisis to
F.strange Britain.
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.

Washington, ?Inn. 13. Garrean diplomacy believes that It in about
to repeat. In Washington flip successes It achieved both at Constantinople
and at ."??ofia. It is th?? new of those who are dose to Count von Hernst/.rfT
and it is equnlly the viem of many who arc clos? to American official life
that German diplomacy I? now on the point of embroiling the l.'nited
Mates with Groat Britein ?nil Great Britain's allie??.
When Count von Bernstorff has presented the Wilson sdministratlon
with the victory which is incident to a German disavowal, in some satis?
factory terms, of the I.usitrmia. and when German compliance with the
rules r." international las? in the submarine matter is equally -ntisfartorily
promised, it is expecte?! on all sides that the administration will be
? ommitted to begin at oiKe an att-a'-k upon me British blockade.
S?h f? result will represen? n final triumph for th? patient per
haronee of the (tem?an Ambassador. His position in the months since
the war began has been pr??ttv gen??rally mi-understood. He has he-en
portrayed as the bitter enemy and as the kind friend of America, pr?ciser?
as the turn of affairs at the moment seamed to justify. The fact, of
course, has been that at all times lie has been the (.enr?an Amha??sador
lind that he has nt ai! times bet-n serving German ends.
SAW I SK FOI T'MTKn 8TATKS.
Karly in the war Count von Hernstorff conceived that it would be
wiser to use than to antagonize the I'nitel State?. At ail times he has
Used his influence again ??t the von Tirpitr. programme and the "terrible
t.ess" that murdered rxeqtrals a? well as belligerent non-combatant--.
This h,-ir- been represent???! ?as due to a friendship for America. Possibly
that friendship may exist, bul the mam m??ti\-e \?.?-- ih? belief that too
nibmnrine policy c?>uld not s,i<-cood and that it would lose b? Germany ?be
?idvaritnge th.it might otherwise r.- derived from American policies and1
i.? liticians.
Precisely as long a?? t're submarine policy seemed ?,, f.-? linking pts.g
ItSS the Gorman govcrnnittr paid small heed to Herr.-toriT'- argument-;
und appeals. It believed thai II COuld contpier the Rritish blor-kade directly,
nnd it was impatient of all suggestion or criticism. 'I he result Wu?. ,,..
Count von RernstorfT had foreseen, that the relations between the 1'nited j
State?* and Germany grew worse and w..r;-e. until the possibility of war
had to be considered. Had the submarine operation continued to give
promising result?-, there, is no question that Gagman*} would have eon- !
tmued to give no hearing to T.ern-tnrtT.

those who bold his view in (H-miany. tflS first chance to obtain a real trial .
