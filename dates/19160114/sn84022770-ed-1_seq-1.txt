50 by 60 In size, well-lighted through
the day by large windows and at

The ticket offices occupy the east
ern end of the main building and
south of them are the 'parcel and
freight sheds, while down the west
side of the yards are the passenger
tracks, covered by an umbrella shed
to protect passengers from the
weather. All the modern features of
railroad depots are to be noted in
this building and its equipment.

FIGHT OVER GUY
ENGINEER STILL ON
ALL OTHER OFFICERS APPOINT
ED BY MAYOR AND CON
FIRMED BY COUNCIL.
Opposition to the re-appointment
of J. B. Weddell as city engineer,
started at the first meeting of the
new council last week, was carried
further at the adjourned meeting of
the council Tuesday evening and is
still unsettled, Mayor Geo. A. Mott
man, though announcing all his
other appointments, having left the
city engineer'* office still unfilled.
Weddell has been city engineer
since Mottman was first elected may
or, having held the office for three
terms, and the mayor proposed to
re-appoint him this year. Informa
tion as to the exposition to Weddell
in the council reached the mayor
early last week and, in the absence
of Councilman Talcott this week, he
did not present the name of any ap
pointee for that office to the council.
In the meantime, however, at the
mayor's direction, the city has dis
pensed with the services of its engi
neering department for January and
February, and any appointment that
is made will not take effect, it is un
derstood, until March 1. Several
hundred dollars in salaries and ex
penses are thus saved.
Counciimen Forstell, Maynard and
Draham are said to be opposed to
Weddell's re-appointment, the last
two named being the new Repub
lican members of the council, while
Talcott, McClintic, Yauger and Ram
berg are said to stand with the
mayor, so that in the absence of Tal
cott the council was equally divided.
Inasmuch as a majority of the coun
cil are standing with the mayor, how
ever, it is expected that Weddell's
appointment will be made and con
firmed after Talcott's return.
No changes among the other ap
pointive officers of the city were
made by the mayor, when he pre
sented his appointments to the coun
cil Tuesday night, and all were
unanimously confirmed by the coun
cil. The mayor did make quite a
few changes, however, in the stand
ing committees of the council, chief
of which was the removal of Council
man Forstell from the chairmanship
of the streets committee and the ap
pointment of McClintic in his place.
The membership of the committees
as well as the list of appointive of
ficers is published under "City Legal
Notices" on page 6.

DOME'S CAFE CLOSES
Olympia's Famous Restaurant Quits
After Nearly 411 Years'
Operation.
Olympia's famous restaurant,
Doane's safe, known far and wide
throughout the Northwest, closed its
doors Tuesday for the first time since
it was founded in 1873 by Captain W.
J. Doane, as the result of the sudden
departure the previous evening of a
couple of young people who had been
operating the place for George Miller,
the lessee.
Along with these young people, so
the story goes, also went some 450
napkins, and a lot of cutlery, silver
ware, tablecloths, dishes, crockery
and other restaurant equipment.
They are presumed to have gone to
San Francisco. Miller says he will
not prosecute, but the situation is
being investigated by Prosecuting At
torney Geo. F. Yantis.
Doane's restaurant probably would
have closed anyhow inside of another
month, or else moved to another lo
cation, for the building is to be torn
down to make room for the modern
concrete business block which James
Martin is to erect on the quarter
block at Fifth and Washington
streets.
COUNTY MAY PAVE PART
OF HIGHWAY TO LACEY
Commissioners Consider Expenditure
of $31,000 State Road
Funds.
Expenditure of some $31,000
Thurston county will receive from
the state this year under the perma
nent highway act in the construction
of a mile or a mile and a half of con
crete roadway on the Pacific highway
from the eastside city limits toward
Lacey, and the laying of two addi
tional miles of macadam on the
Olympia-Tenino road north of Tenino,
ft under consideration by the county
commissioners.
Whether anything will be done on
the Tenino road is undecided, but the
commissioners have adopted a reso
lution directing County Engineer W.
H. Yeager to make a survey and esti
mate of cost on the proposed hard
surfacing of the Pacific highway east
of Olympia. It is expected it will cost
about $15,00 a mile to construct a
20-foot roadway laid of one-course
concrete, seven inches thick in the
center and five at the sides. If the
work is undertaken, the road will be
straightened where it passes Mt.
Tabor cemetery.
The commissioners are also con
sidering the construction of a con
crete roadway from the end of the
present paving on South Main street
around to the Log Cabin, believing
that part of the cost could be paid by
the creation of an assessment district,
providing two-thirds of the property
owners desired the improvement.

FIGHT APPOINTMENT OF
A. G. WEST AS SUPERVISOR
Contest Over Road Job in New Dis
trict to Be Settled Next
Tuesday.
Opposition to the appointment of
A. O. West as supervisor of Thurston
county's new road district, No. 6,
composed of portions of old Nos. 3, 4
and 5, south and west of Tumwater,
has arisen since the meeting of the
Good Roads' Association last Thurs-
day, according to reports from the
district this week, and is taking the
form of petitions circulated among
the taxpayers of the new district, urg
lgn the appointment of Jeff Thomp
son.
Next Tuesday, tne commissioners
announced this week, the supervisor
for the new district will be appointed.
For the last year West has been prac
tically supervisor of this district, hav
ing charge of it under George Sump
tion, supervisor of No. 3, and at the
association meeting last Thursday
West received 100 votes. From the
political standpoint, West has lately
been credited with "running the dis
trict to suit himself," and his ap
pointment as supervisor has been
taken for granted, inasmuch as he is
also on very friendly terms with Com
missioners ABe Rowe and T. Ives
Dodge.
The opposition to West, however,
claims to have many signers to peti
tions asking for Thompson's appoint
ment, asserting that all of the sign
ers, also, are bona-fire taxpayers
while alleging that the meeting of the
Good Roads' Association was
"packed." Furthermore, they claim.
the association, which was organized
a year ago in the old district No. 3,
was not re-organized for the new dis
trict No. 6 prior to last Thursday's
meeting, and therefore there is no
legal association in No. 6. and fur
ther, that the association that does
exist in that section is not composed
of 75 per cent of the property-owners
of the district, as required by the new
law passed by the last legislature.
Leading in the campaign against
West and circulating petitions for
the appointment of Thompson are
Fred Reichel, Dave Turner, Emmett
lirown and Hudson, and they propose
to present their petitions to the com
missioners next Tuesday, protesting
to West's appointment and challeng
ing tHe legality of the Good Koads'
Association meeting.
West received 100 votes at the
Good Roads meeting, as against 30
for Trosper and 11 for Jeff Thomp
son, and he has not undertaken to
circulate petitions. While admitting
that. 75 per cent of the property in
the district is not represented in the
membership of the association,
West's supporters claim that provi
sion is a "joker" in the law, pointing
out that the Weyerhaueaer Timber
company as well as other concerns
owns large tracts of land in the dis
trict, and declare further, that at last.

CROSBY POLICE JUDGE.
Local Justice of Peace Qualifies After
Superior Court Decision.
Justice of the Peace Walter Crosby
filed the required SI,OOO bond with
City Clerk W. A. Hoage Wednesday
and qualified as Olympia's police
judge, as the result of a decision
given the fore part of this week by
Superior Judge I). F. Wright that
under the new municipal code Olym
pia had been without a police judge
of legal standing since last June,
when the new code requiring police
judges in third class cities to be reg
ularly elected justices of the peace
went into effect.
The decision was given in the case
of a local Chinaman arrested on a
warrant sworn to before former Po
lice Judge Milton Giles, charging him
with selling liquor to minors and
without a license, the alleged offense
having occurred during Christmas
week. The Chinaman's attorney de
murred to the charge, alleging that
Giles was not legally police judge,
and the court upheld that point.
Justice Crosby was appointed by
Mayor Mottman at the adjourned
council meeting Tuesday night
FIRST RAILROAD INTO
OLYMPIA ABANDONED
NORTHERN PACIFIC DISCONTIN
UES TRAIN SERVICE ON
P. T. S. THIS WEEK.
After having been operated for
almost 38 years, first as a narrow
gauge line constructed by local citi
zens to give Olympia a railroad outlet
to the outside world, and then re
constructed to standard gauge 25
years ago this fall, train service on
the Port Townsend Southern railroad
, between Olympia and Tenino was dis-
I Continued last Monday by orders from
Northern Pacific officials. It was
Olympla's first railroad. What serv
ice the company proposes to estab
lish in its place, if any, has not been
announced. Residents along the line
are protesting to its discontinuance.
The condition of the track was
such that the company either had to
re-build the entire line between
Olympia and the junction with the
new Pt. Defiance line at Plum Sta
tion, or else abandon traffic over it,
and chose the latter course. Ever
since the Pt. Defiance line has been
in operation only about half of the
old P. T. S. road has been used, the
portion from Plum Station to Tenino
having been abandoned.
The construction of the P. T. S.
in the early days of Olympia was a
great event and was made possible by
bonds purchased largely by local
people. It ran from Long Bridge
south on the west side of the channel
through Tumwater and on to Tenino
and regular service was first inaugu
rated over it August 10, 1878. It
was made the occasion for a great
celebration.
During the railroad boom of the
early nineties the line was taken over
by the promoters of the Port Town
send Southern, who proposed to con
struct a line from Port Townsend
down the Olympic penlnshla through
this city to either a line from Taco
ma to Portland or else direct to
Portland to a connection with a
transcontinental line. A consider
able subsidy was raised here at that
time, a portion of the line was built
from Port Townsend south to Quil
cene and the line between this city
was standardized, but the panic of
'93 "broke" the promoters and the
line as projected was never built.
Some years later the Northern Pa
cific bought the line, but it continued
to be operated as a separate com
pany until the Northern Pacific
leased the Port Townsend end of it
to the Milwaukee railroad about two
years ago and formally took over tho
local branch.
Olympia, in common with Western
Washington, has experienced a severe
cold spell this week, the thermom
eter registering as low as 11 degrees
above zero one night the fore part of
tho week, while Tuesday night and
Wednesday there was another heavy
snow, so that the ground is again
covered with five or six inches of
snow. Olympia has had more snow
fall this winter than for several
years. #

IVEIt X KLSON, 20 YEARS OIiD,
COMMITS SUICIDE OX RAXCH
XEAR KAIXIER.
"Well, goodbye, kid, I'm going
now."
With these words, spoken to his
wife after a fierce struggle with her
i and his mother, Iver Nelson, 26 yeara
old, an employe on the farm of M. L.
Page about four miles south of Rai
nier, committed suicide Wednesday
by blowing out his brains with a shot
] gun. The funeral will take place at
! the home of the mother, Mrs. Mary
Ann Nelson, at Bucoda, Friday.
Despondency, approaching insan
! ity, believed to have been caused by
constant worrying over his ill health
jand inability to work, is given as the
j reason for the young man's act. He
■ had been suffering from inflammatory
I rheumatism for several years and
Tuesday went to Centralia to consult
| a physician.
Wednesday morning Nelson went
j out into the yard to draw a pail of
■ water, and was so nearly overcome
from the exertion when he returned
| to the house that his wife and mother
' put him to bed. They thought ho
would remain there, but in a short
time he appeared in the kitchen,
grabbed a double-barrelled shotgun,
rested his head on the muzzle and
started to pull the trigger, when the
two women screamed and grabbed
the gun, so that the load was dis
charged into the ceiling.
He became enraged, then, and
fought desperately with his wife and
mother, who tried to take the gun
away from him, but he broke away
from them, rushed Into the parlor,
exclaimed, "Well, goodbye, kid, I'm
going now," and shot himself.
Coroner H. N. Sticklln and Under
taker Jesse Mills visited the Pace
home Wednesday afternoon, after
learning of the tragedy, and brought
the body to Olympla. The young
man had lived in the vicinity of Rai
nier for about two years and is sur
vived by the widow, his mother, and
a 2-year-old daughter, Ivera.
FIRST TRIAL IN FRAUD
CASES STARTS MONDAY
Charges Involving Former Claim
Agent Gillies to Be Heard la
Local Court.
Trial of J. F. Gillies, former chief
claim agent of the industrial insur
ance commission, on the charge of
forgery in connection with the loot
ing of that fund, will be started in
the local superior court next Monday.
Some 38 witnesses have been called
by the state.
Trial of the different charges
against Gillies, Frank Stone and
Gene Kearns, former local saloon
keeper, will occupy the attention of
the local court for the next few
weeks, and the state authorities ex
pect that it will be the middle of
February before the cases are ended.
All of the cases against Gillies are
set for hearing prior to those in
which he is involved with Kearns
and Stone, but it is probable that the
state will seek a re-assignment of the
trials to permit the trial of Stone
following t'.ie completion of the first
case against Gillies.
When arraigned the latter part of
last week on the grand larceny and
conspiracy charges, Gillies, Kearns
and Stone all entered pleas of not
guilty, as each has done in the indi
vidual cases against him. The de
fendants will be represented by At
torney Thos. M. Vance.
One of the interesting sidelights of
the week on the industrial insurance
frauds was the payment of $2,000 to
the state by the company which went
on Gillies' bond for that amount.
The company admitted liability and
made no effort to obstruct or evade
payment.
After drafting a constitution and
by-laws and considering other details
of the organization, the executive
committee of the Thurston County
Potato club voted to call a meeting
of the general membership at the
Chamber of Commerce January 22,
after a conference in this city last
Saturday.
