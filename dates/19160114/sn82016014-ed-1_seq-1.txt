Washington, Jan. 14. Senator
Works, Republican, of California to
day introduced a resolution authoriz
ing and directing the president to in
tervene in Mexico, to establish anl
maintain a government there until it is
safe to withdraw.
"t'p to this time." said Senator
Works, addressing the senate, "con
gress has permitted all responsibility
for conditions in Mexico to rest upon
t he president. It is too grave a re
nponsibi Jity. I very much doubt now
that such a peaceful outcome is possi

declare war, and, thai is wfcat inter

ageously shoulder the responsibility. 1
RHk that the resolution be referred to
the foreign relations committee with
the hope that it will take prompt ac

No formal announcement was made
but officials close to the president de
clared the administration had no in

ico at present. The view was reiter
ated that Carranza should be given an
opportunity to demonstrate his abilit
to restore order. This was encou: -aged

PEACE TERMS SHY
Holy See Doesn't Ask Belliger
ents Into Conference.
Each Side Sees Victory and
Wants to Dictate.
Rome, Jan. 14. "The Holy See did
nothing up to today either directly or
Indirectly to solicit from either group
of belligerents any intervention to par
ticipate in or preside at a peace con
ference." says the Catholic organ Cor
riere IVItalie, in an article evidently
inspired by the Vatican.
lioth groups of belligerents, the pa
per adds, thus far intend to be com
pletely victorious, dictating conditions
of peace outside of any extraneous in
terference. The aim of the pope is
to employ all possible means to ren
der the conflagration less painful to
humanity. If the pope ere present
at a peace congress, his adhesion to
the treaty would bind the consciences
of all Catholics of the contracting na
tions, making it more difficult for any
government to break the agreement.
The pope, it asserts, does not count
upon the European conflict for the so
lution of the Roman situation, which,
as Cardinal Oasparri said, will not be
eettied for force of arms.
There is a general belief in Vatican
circles that the pope will deliver an
other important allocation about war
in the consistory at the end of Febru
ary It is considered certain that the pon
tiff will call the consistory either for
the end of February or shortly after
wards to impose red hats upon newly
created cardinals, Scapanelli and
Fruhwith nuncios at Vienna and
Munich, respectively, who would thus
leave their posts, being replaced ac
cording to present reports at Vienna
by Monsignor Locate! li, now inter
nuncio at Buenos Aires, and at Munich
by Monsignor Aversa. now internuncio
for Brazil.

Kaiser Sends
Victory Sword
To The Sultan
London, Jan. 14. The German
emperor, according to a Constan
tinople dispatch forwarded by
Reuters Amsterdam correspon
dent, has sent a sword to the sul
tan of Turkey together with a
congratulatory message in recog
nition of the success of the Turk
ish campaign on the Gallipoii
peninsula.
In this telegram Emperor Wil
liam said he had learned with
great satisfaction that the enemy's
army had been forced completely
to evacuate Gallipoll. He congrat
ulated the sultan upon a great
victory vhich had brought to an
end the severe attacks of "im
pudent enemies."
As recognition of his admira
tion, the emperor announced that
he had sent a sword to the sultan
in order to Immortalize the com
memoration of a great victory, "a
sword which during a war under
taken for defense and right shall
be pointed at the heads of the
enemy."
In concluding his message the
emperor expressed the conviction
that God's help would in thj end
secure victory.

Alleged Kecalled German Attache Paid
Persons Responsible for 17.
S. Factory Destruction.
London, Jan. 14. Copies of corre
spondence seized from Captain Franz
von Papen, recalled German military
attache at Washington, when he
reached Falmouth on his way to Ger
many have been turned over to thr
American embassy for transmission
to the state department. They show
that Captain von Papen made fre
quent payments to persons charaed
with the responsibility for blowing- un
munitions works and bridges in the
United States.
One entry shows that Captain von
Papen gave 700 to Werner Horn,
who was arrested in connection with
th-? blowing up of a Canadian Pa
cific railway bridge at St. Croix, Me.
The day before this check was is
sued, the German embassy paid ,000
into Captain von Papen's account.
Among the letters taken from Cap
tain von Papen is one from the Ger
man consul at Is'ew Orelans condoling
with him on his recall from Washing
ton and criticizing severely the atti
tude of the American government. A
check stub shows that about two
weeks before the explosion in Seattl
on May 30, 1915, Captain von Papen
sent $500 to the German consul at
Seattle. In February of 1915, he sent
$1,300 to the German consulate in
that city.
Several large payments were made
to Captain von Papen by Count von
Bernstorff, German ambassador at
Washington. Most of these were for
salaries or similar uses. A number of
entries show payments made by the
ambassador to the military attache
for "war intelligence office." line of
the payments on the account made in
October of 1914 was for $2,300.
Captain von Papen's check stubs,
bank books and letters from his bank,
the Riggs National bank of Washing
ton, show about 500 items, many of
which had to do with routine expendi
tures. In January, 1915, Captain von
Papen gave a check payable to Am
sick and company. New York, but with
the name. E. Kuepferlee, in brackets
on the stub. . This is believed to have
reference to the man named Kuepferle
who after being arrested in England
on a charge of espionage, committed
suicide, leaving a written confession
in his cell. As an example of the size
of the captain's financial operations
his bank book shows tnat in January
of ID 15 he received approximately
$6,400 and paid out $5,000.

PLEADS AH ALIBI
Honser's Defense Is He Wasn't
at Murder Scene.
Court Prevents State's Telling
of Other Crimes.
Omaha, Jan. 14. The defense be
gan its testimony today in the case of
Arthur Houser. charged with the mur
der of W. H. Smith, cashier for the
Woodmen of the World national head
quarters. The principal witnesses for
the defense is supposed ' to be Mrs.
May Houser, wife the accused, who
claims her husband was with her at
the time the murder was committed.
The state's case was rested unex
pectedly when Judge English ruled
against the admission of testimony
concerning other crimes charged
against Hauser. some of which he is
allged to have confessed.
The morning testimony in the case
closed at ll:30amid a wild scene of
disorder when 'the defense introduced
it alibi. In answer to a question ask
ed by EdWard Rooney, the Topeka
attorney, who is defending Houser,
Mrs. Houser testified that she and her
baby were with her husband at 9
o'clock on the night of the Smith mur
der. Laundry was delivered at the
Houser home and Houser paid for
she said. The defense closed its testi
mony and the state placed the laun
dry man named on the stand and he
testified that-' he had never delivered
laundry at the home except on Octo
ber 20, four day? after the killing.
On cross-examination the attorney
compelled him to show his receipt
book and it bore the date of October
16, as Mrs. ''Houser testified. The
crowd that Jammed the room went
wild. The defense closed. So did the
state. Judge English was unable to
get order for five minutes. Houser ;
did not go on the stand. It is probable !
that the case will go to the jury Satur-
day. )
Final arguments were heard today i
in the trial of Houser. Before argu- i
ments began ithe, court announced the :
case would not be given to the jury '
until tomorrow morning. One of the
roost sensational developments of the
trial came in the testimony of Charles
Linter, a driver for a laudry company,
who was put on the stand to rebut an
alibi established by Mrs. Houser, the
prisoner's wife. Mrs. Houser was one
of the first witnesses put on the stand
by the defense. Linters records,
which he had brought into court,
showed that he had delivered laundry
at the Houser home October 16, when
the attorneys for the defense on cross
examination elicited this testimony the
crowd which packed the court room
broke into cheers and it was only after
throats by the'jurge to clear the court
room that order was restored.
