Dr. George Taylor, field secre
tary of the Anti-Saloon League
spoke at the PreBbyterian
Church at 11 a. m. Sunday to a
fair audience on the subject of
"State-Wide and Natlonal-Wldd
Prohibition." As the saloons
have been put out of busing
In Oregon I can not see what
good can come at this time by
agitating the question further.
The saloons in Oregon as con
ducted had become a nuisence
and- a menace to the public wel
fare and for that reason the peo
ple voted them out. Not by the
prohibition vote, but by the
whole people, irrespective of
politics or creeds.: The prohi
bition vote in the state 13 about J
8,000, while the majority against
saloons was over 36,000. Tho
Btate is not dry inder this law
as; each household or individual
can get and have shipped to him
two quarts of wliiskey or wine
and twenty-four quarts of beer.
MoBt every family keeps soma
kind of liquor in the house for
use in sickness. Many a weak
child suffering from cholera In
fantum and other wasting dis
eases have been ' saved by the
timely use of a little brandy or
whiskey. Alcohol is invaluable
when properly used. I don't be
lieve in the narrjw-mlndedness
of prohibiting the use of alcohol
to' those who need it, because
there are some who get drunk
on It We might as Justly take
away the fortune of a man who
has made It by honest dealing
and hard work on the grounds
that there are others suffering
because they wont work. Phy
sicians are bettcer qualified to
pass on the use and abuse of
alcohol than the ministers are.
EL Paul said wine was good for
the Btomach and Christ recom
mended it at the wedding feast.
What harm can Lome of a man
taking a glass or two of beer?
None whatever. Some of the
oldest people we have use spir
ltous liquors in some form. It
aids digestion in old people, cir
culates the blond and makes
them feel more cheerful and
, nappy. Whiskey when used In
' moderation and for medical pur
poses is a .blessing.
A meeting of the parents
teachers' assoclation.was held at
the high 'school building Monday
evening. A vry interesting
program, was rendered. Miss
Smith, vice president, presided.
A good audience was present
and all enjoyed the exercises. A
monologue by Mrs! Ortman was
a "Very pleasing and interesting
number. Mrs. Ortman is a
good impersonator. Her solil
oquy was natural and humorous.
'New Resolutions" was the sub
ject of Prof. Coleman's address,
lie thought resolutions were
good if kept, but like pie crust,
they were easily broken. We
should grow wiser and better
every day. Captain Jacobson
member of the board of trustees
spoke on the subject of "Better
Schools and Better Equipment."
He thought teachers should
have Bufflcient equipment to do
good work. School rooms
Bhould be large, airy and well
ventilated; that teachers should
come to their classes well pre
pared to teach the lesson thor
oughly and to Inspire the pupil
with high ideals of lire. The
play grounds Bhould be large,
clean and under the control of
the teachers. The school Is the
best asset of the community.
Captain Jacobson takes great in
terest In good sch6ols. Solo by
Mrs. L; C. Smith, Miss Ilarkle
road presiding at the piano.
' Mrs. Smith has a soft, sweet
voice and is one of Newport's
favorite singers. Trof. Artman
had for his Bubject "The Schools
of Newport." The school build
ings of Newport could not be
more beautifully and health
fully located. The climate is
the most healthful, pure air,
pure mountian water brought
to the city by the gravity system.
The grounds are sandy and dry
.and the school buildings three
In number are modern In all
their appointments and cost
$50,000. The public school has
250 pupils and the high school
U2. The, high school building
cost about $20,000. The school
employs sixteen teachers at a
cost of about 10,000 annually.
This Is somewhat heavy on the
taxpayers but no one complains.
But it Ib apparent that our pub
lic schools cost too much money,
Ten yearB ago our public, school
cost 1700 per annum to run It, j
now $10,000, an increase of ten
fold in ten years. '.'.
At a can meeting of the city
council Monday, A. J. Brown
was recommended for the posi
tion of road supervisor of the
Newport road district. The
County Court inakes the ap-
nnintmAnt Mr nmwn la fa.

good supervisor,
Andrew Porter, the newly ap
pointed roadmaster, was in town
during the week looking over
the condition of the roads and
posting himself upon the needs
of the county In his line. Mr.
Porter has had long experience
in roall and bridge building and
therefore he is well qualified to
fill the position he has been ap
pointed to. It came to him un
sought and consequently .he Is
under obligations to no one. He
is entirely Independent.
, Commissioner Hurt was in
town during th week and in
speaking of the affairs of -the
county said they were In a very
satisfactory condition. A good,
deal of money had been spent in
road and bridge building and
some mistakes had been made,
but taken altogether It had been
a very successful year for Lln
colnl coutny.
The Ban don went out on high
