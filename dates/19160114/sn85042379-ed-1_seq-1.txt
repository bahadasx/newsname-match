COUNTY FAIR
BOARD MEETS
Directors and Officers of Fair
Association Elected.
PETER A. WEST, PRESIDENT
Report of Secretary Shows Financial
Standing of the Association and
Work Accomplished for Year
At the annual meeting of the stock
holders of the Valley County Fair as
sociation, held Monday night in the
Commercial club rooms, a new board
of directors was elected to serve dur
ing the coming year. The extreme
cold weather prevented many from
attending, and only three stockholders
were present in person, besides the
retiring board of directors, repre
senting 229% shares, which was more
than a majority of the stock issued.
Those present voted their own
shares and proxies and Peter A.
West, T. J. Hocking, W. W. Hurd, R.
M. Young and C. Prentice were elect
ed to the new board of directors. T.
J. Hocking and Peter A. West were
members of last years' board and are
thoroughly familiar with the work
and the new members have proven
themselves "live wires" in helping
any public enterprise. Dr. M. D.
Hoyt and J. L. Truscott, who were
members of the board in 1915, would
not allow their names to be men
tioned for this year's board, after
having served the fair faithfully and
successfully since its inception.
The report of last year's fair as
shown in the report read by Secre
tary Moore showed that it was a suc
cess from the standpoint of quality
in the exhibits, entertainment and the
enthusiasm displayed by those who
participated. It was not the finan
cial success of the previous year,
partly owing to the greater expense
the association buildings made nec
essary, and largely to the unfavor
able season, which caused many farm
ers to refrain from participating.
Many of the farmers who had exhib
its at the fair each year were com
pelled to remain away and attend to
their threshing and harvesting which
was delayed many weeks by long in
clement weather. This detracted con
siderably from the usual number of
exhibitors. There were 372 exhibitors
in 1915 as against 419 in 1914, a de
crease of 10 per cent.
Compared with 1914, the receipts
for admissions, concessions, races,
etc., there was a gain of about 50 per
cent. The association can show a
gain for the year 1915, as there were
permanent improvements and repairs
made on the grounds amounting to
$1,173.03. These consist of a new
grand stand with office for the sec
retary and an exhibit room therein 10
by 80 feet; a new stock barn, con
taining 24 box stalls, a new judge's
stand, a men's toilet and doors hung
on all hog stalls. Repairs were nec
essary on the woman's building, agri
cultural building, and concrete piers
were placed under the old grand
stand, bolting it down so that wind
can not blow it OVer, as happened to
one during the past summer. Two
drinking fountains • were provided,
each holding about 90 gallons of
water.
The expense of the 1915 fair was
far greater than that of 1914, in the
size of premiums offered to the
farmer, for races, and in the conven
iences provided on the grounds. A
report on the finances showed that
the association was in very good con
dition, with an indebtedness of less
than $15.00
A vote of thanks was tendered the
retiring officers for their efforts in
making the fair the success it was
and Dr. Hoyt and J. L. Truscott
came in for special mention for their
untiring efforts and sacrifice of time
to make the Valley County fair lank
among the first in the state. An
item which has tended greatly to the
success of the fair each year, is the
manner in which the local business
men have offered valuable premiums
each year to be competed for
Fair Directors Meet.
Tuesday night the newly elected
board of directors held their first
meeting and elected Peter A. West,
president of the Fair association, C.
Prentice, vice president, and R. M.
\oung, treasurer. . The election
Mr. West as president is an ideal one.
He is a practical farmer and stock
ti - member f th I
man an , o e oar
last year, he devoted a great deal
j time towards making the fair a suc
' cess.
The directors will set the date of
I the fair at a later meeting, but it
will, no doubt, be about the middle
of September. Much depends upon
the dates set for the Montana fair,
so as to allow sufficient time to pre
pare exhibits for it.
S. C. Moore was re-appointed sec
retary, which will meet with popular
approval. Mr. Moore has been one
of the biggest factors in making the
fair a real, live issue. Serving with
out pay, he has shouldered the enor
mous amount of work entailed by his
| position, and business men and farm
ers alike unite in giving him highest
praise.
STATE BANKS HAVE
LARGE RESOURCES
Big Increase Shown Throughout the
State in Report.
Banking conditions in Montana dur
ing the past year are well described in
an article in the Financial Age of
New York, written by H. S. Magraw,
state bank examiner. It is one of
many articles carried at this time of
the year on conditions in this part of
the nation.
Mr. Magraw calls attention to the
fàct that in ten short years the re
sources of state, private and national
banks have increased 285 per cent.
He calls attention to the splendid fi
nancial condition of Montana, due to.
the big crops and the metal output,
and concludes by showing that the
state got the lion's share of prizes on
her agricultural produce at San Fran
cisco. He says that the present re
sources of state and private banks
are $71,896,636.54. The article fol
lows:
"The beginning of the year 1915 in
Montana showed little reflection of
year
Montana showed little reflection of
the uncertainty which was felt in fi
nancial circles in other parts of the
country. The short crop of 1914 had
caused an unusual demand for money,
which condition continued up to har
vest time.
"At the beginning of the year the
banking department of Montana, in
co-operation with the comptroller and
the supervisors of other states, began
a determined campaign against over
drafts. The bankers of the state gave
their fullest co-operation and most
satisfactory results were accom
plished. The call of September 2,
showing a decrease in this amount of
83 per cent since December 31, 1914
"The bankers are as glad to get rid
of the overdraft evil as we are
"On March 6 the new bank act be
came effective. This new law was the
result of an 'organized effort on the
part of the State Bankers' associa
tion and has proven very satisfac
tory.
"The new law designates the state
examiner as superintendent of banks,
but provides for bank examiners sep
arate from examiners of public of
fices which comes under the supei-vi
sion of the state examiner.
"Besides a codification of the form
er law the new bank act contains sev
eral new and important features. The
principal ones are—direction given
the superintendent of banks in grant
ing charters, prohibition of future or
ganization of private banks and pro
vision for two examinations a year.
"The bumper crops of this year, to
gether with the good prices that have
been obtained for all products, have
put Montana on a better basis than
ever before.
"In these days of hundred million
dollar banks the total resources of 211
state, 21 private and 65
banks in Montana (September
1915) $121,320,112.13 do not seem
great moment, yet the wonderful
growth of 285 per cent in state banks
in ten years is just the beginning.
The full significance of this growth
national
„
^
may only be realized by considering
that it has been brought about during
the period of agricultural develop-'*"
ment. Montana has 35 million acres
of tillable land as yet only four mil

Club
PLAN AN ACTIVE CAMPAIGN
Object of Club to Boost Glasgow and
Vicinity Will be Given Impetus—
Committee Heads Named.
The boosting spirit which charac
terized the Glasgow Commercial club
during 1915 will be a bigger factor
than ever in the work the coming
year under the new president, J. W.
Wedum.
Through the efforts of the club the
past year Glasgow has been adver
tised far and wide and probably no
city in Montana has received • more
publicity in the newspapers and mag
azines throughout the country. The
coming year will see the club follow
ing up the work in this line with even
greater impetus, and the benefits
should be many.
The new board of directors of the
Commercial club, appointed by the
president, follow:
W. W. Hurd, chairman of the com
mittee on finance; Walter Shanley,
chairman of the committee on audit
ing; John Hurly, chairman of the
committee on city development;
P. Mclntyre, chairman of the com
mittee on entertainment and public
ity; Maurice Reuler, chairman of the
j com mittee on membership; F. D. Al
; vor ^' chairman of the ways and
means committee; C. Prentice, chair
man of the committee on county de
velopment and good roads; Otto
Christinson, chairman of the commit
tee on immigration and agriculture;
J. L. Truscott, advisory member;
M. Young, treasurer; T. J. Hocking,
president; L W " Wedum ' Pa
ient.
The men selected as directors rep
resent the various business interests
of the city and without a doubt they
will work for the best interests of the
city and the surrounding country.
Among the things that the club
will work on the coming year,
enumerated by Secretary Moore, are
the erection of a boys' athletic club
building, establishing and improving
the parks, improving the cemetery
engine water pump, placing signs
j comiTierC i a l ciub 7o7 boys'and'giris,
I assistinfr in making arrangements for
the June county gra(le ath , etic
the east and west entrance to the city,
aiding civic development, organizing
a volunteer fire department, a junior
making an industrial survey of the
city, buying sugar beet seed
growing this year, putting out stick
ers and cards for business houses,
plan to secure dairy cows for desir
able farmers, and obtaining a cross
ing under the Great Northern tracks.
These are but a few of the things that
are paramount now and which
club has been working on. The work
of securing the accomplishment
the above mentioned items will
pushed with utmost vigor.
"We expect to carry on the work
of the Commercial club to boost Glas
gow and the surrounding country,"
said Mr. Wedum yesterday. "One
thing we will try our utmost to
and that is to have everybody in
community pull together, for in this
way the best results can be obtained.
The members of the board of direc
tors are all representative business
men and will work together for
best interests of the city."

Albert Borgrud, aged about 45 years,
j an old and well known resident of
j Ada country, after a periodical
j sion with John Barleycorn at Havre
j Tuesday morning, cut the throat
indi-jhis dog and then slashed his

horse loose, and rode the other animal
over to an irrigation ditch. Ybarrola,
deciding that Borgrud was drunk,;
later followed him. He found Borg
rud lying on the ground with his
throat cut, his dog lying on his breast.
Borgrud showed signs of life, but the
dog was dead. Two men were sum
moned from the Ybarrola ranch to as
sist in taking the suicide to the house,
but life was extinct when they ar
rived.
Sheriff Buckley was notified and,
accompanied by Dr. Hoon, motored

PARTY LOSES WAY
% IN COLD BLIZZARD
Travelers From North Country Wan
der for Four Hours Off Road.
While no fatalities have been re
ported from the cold and blizzards of
the past week, the storm last Sunday
caused eight people to go through a
harrowing experience.
Eight people from the north coun
try, on their way to Glasgow, were
caught in the blizzard on this side
of Midway Sunday morning. The
road was covered up by the deep snow
and the wind drifted it into piles,
making the journey especially ardu
ous. The intense cold and the blind
ing snow, and the inability of the
travelers to follow the road, caused
them to lose their way and they wan
dered out on the prairie, a few miles
"north of Coleman's, unable to get
their bearings or to make any head
way against the storm. For four
hours they were in this plight until
Martin Risa, who was in the party,
«truck out and reached Tom Cole
r/ar's ranch.
Tom Coleman had only that morn
ing returned from Glasgow, making
the trip home against the blizzard.
The road was filled with big drifts
and the cut at the Behner-Mooney
hill was filled with snow, making
impossible to get through. He was
forced to go around the hill and fin
' ally reached his destination. Tom
suffers from a badly frozen chin as
a result of his strenuous ride.
On arriving home he was told
the plight of the people lost in the
storm and with his hired man, John
Shippe, started out to search for
them, driving his pacing team.
few miles north of his ranch they
observed the party and showed them
the way to shelter. Elmer Blikken,
who was one of the party, first ob
served the rescuers, and started on
his saddle horse to head them off.
i When he hit the graded road, over
which the snow had drifted, his
I horse took a header and Elmer was
thrown to the ground, but fortunate
ly a convenient snowdrift broke his
fall and he escaped with only a few
bruises. The party arrived at Cole
man's safely and remained there dur
ing the day, healing their partly
frozen faces.
ENGINE DOES MOVIE STUNT.
A real movie thriller was enacted
in the local yards Wednesday after
noon when the local switching engine,
: termed the "goat" by local railroad
j ers, forgot its genial disposition and
! ran away.
i The engine was being used for
switching in the west end of the
yards and with one car attached had
cut off from the west end of the
l.._- A 1 . 1 . .1
-, train. A break occurred in the me
j ehanism and the engineer was unable
j to bring the engine to a stop. Pick
! ing up speed, the engine spurted
open
; when
j down the yards and luckily it had
track. The fireman jumped
he saw it could not be con

effort to

I-very effort to bring it to a stop,
jumped, when he thought a collision
i with the engine and i\o. 1 was un
avoidable. The engine, under its own

guidance, sped out of the city and did
.
stop until about seven
! not come to
j miles east of the city.
j For a time the thought of the run-.

GLASGOW TEAM
DEFEATS HAVRE
Locals Outplay Opponents and Com«
Out Victors by Score of 22 to 18.
The fast local quintet ef basketball
tossers went up another notch to
ward the championship of northeast
ern Montana last Friday night when
the speedy Havre team was taken
into camp by a score of 22 to 18.
From the first whistle the Glas
gow boys took the aggressive and be
wildered the Havre boys by their ac
curate basket shooting, but, as the
game progressed, the visiting team
took a brace and it was only through
the good defensive work of the locals
that the score was not reversed. The
first half ended with the score 14 to
9 in favor of Glasgow.
Fouls were numerous in the second
half and there was a tendency to
"rough it," and for a while it was a
toss up as to which side would come
out victorious. The stellar work of
Captain Heiland of the local team was
the bright feature of the game. Be
sides getting three baskets from the
floor, he made ten free throws in as
many trials. Brader of the Havre
team scored all the points for his
team, getting five baskets and six
free throws out of a dozen attempts.
The work of Koçpang and Lebert at
guard was excellent, time and again
spoling Havre's team work. Lebert
made two pretty baskets and Wedum
dropped one through the net.
The game ended with the score
standing 22 to 18 in favor of the loc
als. Havre had come down here ex
pecting to have "easy pickings," but
the team they went up against proved
themselves their equals.
