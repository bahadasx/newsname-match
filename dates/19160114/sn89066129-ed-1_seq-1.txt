Abating Pool Halls
Pool halls in small towns have
come under the ban of the county
couit of Chariton county and at
the December meeting licenses in
Brunswick, Mendon, Triplett,
Keytesville, and Dean Lake were
refused by the court. Commenting
on this fact the Marceline Herald
very truthfully says:
It is presumed that the court
had good and sufficient reasons for
its action. The observation of
The Herald has been that a pool
hall in a small town is not a
desirable thing, because of the
fact too often it is conducted by
men who have no regard for
morality or the good of the young
men of that particular town, and
it does place before the young man
the temptation to spend his money
in small amounts to no good pur
pose. It does not educate or
elevate him, and has a tendency to
teach him the gambling habit."
