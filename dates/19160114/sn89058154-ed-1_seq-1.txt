Corinth Letter.
Hon. J. W. Purviance, .
' ' , ' Selmer,
v Tennessee.
My Dear Friend: -
It was my intention
to write you on New Year's day, but
was prevented from doing so en ac-
- count of sickness. I have had a se
vere cold lagrippe, I suppose, and
have been confined to my bed several
day 8.", .
It seems as a man gets" older, the
more inclined he is to revert to the
pist, which is natural, and reasonable
and true to this instinct.' During my
sleepless hours .last night, while, ev
eryone else around was resting in
peaceful slumber, in the midst of the
quiet hush of midnight and the pall
of darkness, my .. imagination took a
leap into the past and traversed a
space of fifty years' or more, and in
this panoramic scene, I saw oldPurdy
in its early days; great streams of
humanity, composed of the early res
idents of McNairy, tramping in every
direction throughout the historic lit
tle village. I saw such grand old
characters as the Wisdoms, Warrens
and Wrights, . and as I .thought of
these families, the names of Col. Dew
Wisdom. Jas. 'Warren, Marcus J.
and John V. Wright, formed an array
of galaxy too brilliant to describe and
too noble to be forgotten; I saw grea.t
numbers of my youthful friends 'round
. about me as they then ' appeared
those grand old heroes! ' Tab Shull
. and Bill Jopling were busy doing good
and extending love and kindness to
"all who would accept it J then I could
see the Saqders, Rulemans, Huddles
tons, Riggs, Kincaids, Adams, Gages,
Devaclts, Plunks,, Murrays, . Stiles,
Beard -, Hursts, Finleys, McXinneys,
McGlothrans, Hunters, Streets, Ker
bys, Sweats, Andersons, Erwins, Sto
valls. Princes, Pools, Bradens, Bells,
Abernathys all of these families, to
gether with a thousand . other early
scenes around old Purdy, constituted
one of the grandest panoramas that
evet came to my view. But, alas!
where are most all of these early as
sociates. And the fact that they
have crossed over the river very much
endears you and the few yet remain
ing to my heart, for there is nothing
that so awakens a man's sentiments,
and especially a man at my age, as
to call forth his early life and take a
labyrinthian stroll through the maze
of young manhood in youthful glee
and unalloyed happiness with those he
loved so well. I am now in my 82d
year, and still those sweet, blissful
hours spent in my early life with my
old McNairy friends are just as force
ful as ever, and while these sweet
thoughts throw a halo of glorious
delight throughout the recesses of my
'ysoul, they, perform another mission
and the unavoidable lachvrymal agent
of man's nobler impulse brings forth
a profusion of tears as if to attest
the devotion of the heart.
I trust that you and all my old Mc
Nairy friends may have a more pros
perous year in every sense of the
word than ever enjoyed before.
It is a source of great satisfaction
to be able to communicate with you
and all my old friends, and I hope
that this letter may be read by all
with as much pleasure as it Is writ
fen,
I have just read an article in your
paper by Mr. Perkins of New York, a
son of that grand woman whose chris
tian graces and superior intellectual
endowment? doubtless haye been in
strumental in moulding some of the
great characters of the country. Mrs.
Jane Sanders Perkins, as she was fa
miliarity known, was the daughter of
the Hon. Lindsay Sanders, that stal
wart nobleman, whose family history
was connected with the best thought
and highest type of citizenship of'Mo
Nairy county. That good woman
was a true friend to my dear parents,
and I never shall forget the lest
Christmas greetings she sent to my
wife and myself, when she 6aid she
loved us for my dear parents' sake,
and I can also say as she did, I love
her son Lindsay for his mother's sake.
I hardly know when to stop writing
when I get to thinking of the past,
but I guess enough has been written
for this time.
Come to see me when you come to
Corinth. I am getting old and do
not know how it will be by another
New Year, and if the blessed Lord
sees proper to take me from this life,
I pray that I may be" permitted to
meet you all in that blissful clime
where we may bask forever in the
glorious sunshine of God's eternal
love, . .
With best wishes, I am,
Your friend,
Wiles C. Meeks.
Gravelhill News. ,
Health of the community is' better
than it has been for some time. Some
Bicknees but none serious,
After spending the holidays with
his mother and other relatives, M. D.
Huggins left Friday for his home in
Texas. , -,r , -. ..
Cleveland Springer ane family and
Carl Springer left Monday for the
west.
V. T. Hewitt has moved to Gravel
hill. He is employed by Springer &
Gooch as salesman.
D. C. Gooch was in our town Mon
day on business.
' Will Smith's building is on a stand
still on account of the bad weather.
S. H. McCullar is doing a nice busi
ness. : . ' . . .
The only things we need now to
bring the town to the front are good
roads and improved ginning machin
ery, and doubtless McCullar will put
it in as he can do this cheaper than
anyone else. If he fails to do this, it
is understood 'that it will be done by
someone else. So we hope to have
the improvements without any fric
tion and all work together for the
good of the community.
We regret to report the death of
our kinsman and friend, Rufus Farris,
which occorred about noon Monday.
He had been in poor health for over
a year and was confined to his bed for
several weeks. He bore his suffer
ings with patience, talking business
and planning for the future seeming
ly not realizing his conditioo. How
ever, on one occasion when he saw his
devoted wife grieving, he told her not
to grieve for him, that he was not
afraid to die. This is great conso
lation to the bereaved oneg. He had
never identified himself with a church.
Bit religion wai honesty, He wu
charter member of the Gravelhill W.
0. W. camp.' Funeral services were
conducted by the Primitive Baptist
pastor, and sad hearted Woodmen
bore his remains to their last resting
place in Gravelhill cemetery. He is
survived by his wife, little son, four
brothers, one sister and a host , of
other relatives, and to them we ex
tend our heartfelt sympathy.

BETTER LIVE
STOCK FAVORED
Many Farmers Decide to Grow
Less Cotton and More Cattle
i New Life in the Workj
EXCELLENT RESULTS OBTAINED
Bankers Offer to Loan Farmers of th
County $15,000 at a Reduced Rate of
Interest on Long Time Note With
Which to Buy Cattle.
(By R. M. Murphy, Division of Exten
, slon, University of Tennessee.)
Sentiment In favor of better live
stock is rapidly developing into action,
Gibson county farmers have decided
to grow less cotton and more cattle. A
movement started a few weeks ago
amongst the bankers of the county re
sulted in their offer to loan the farm
ers $15,000.00 at a reduced rate of in
terest on long time notes. This stim
ulated the farmers Into immediate ac
tion. A committee was appointed to
decide whether or not efforts should
be confined to one breed of cattle and
If so, which one. The committee de
cided unanimously in favor of the
Hereford. ' A buying committee was
appointed and as soon as cattle could
be located they started after them.
Each banker looked after his own pa
trons. Notes were given by the farm
ers, placing at the disposal , of the
buying committee sums varying In
amounts according to the kind and
number of cattle wanted. The notes
were made for $150.00 for bulls, and
$200.00 for bred heifers and cows, so
that there would be a safe margin.
The bankers decided to allow one of
uieir numuer to nanaie tne enure sum.
When all of the notes were in, each
of the other banks mailed checks for
the respective amounts to the bank
selected and the buying committee
drew a draft on this bank for the en
tire amount.
The cattle were located In Western
Missouri and consisted of bulls rang
ing in ages from 12 to 18 months, bred
heifers, and a number of cows with
calves at foot and bred again, totaling
65 head exclusive of the young calves.
They arrived home in excellent shape
and with two more calves than they
started with, both in good spirits.
These cattle were bought In small
lots; on the average, not more than
two head going to one man. Upon
their arrival home they were greeted
by a ery much excited crowd. As
they marched up the main Btreet of
town they created more excitement
than a circus parade.
Prices were adjusted by the com-
mitee according to relative values of
animals, and a price placed upon each
animal. The freight costs and other
expenses were prorated In accordance
with the prices on animals since the
prices corresponded very well with
the size and weight of animals. The
average cost, including all expenses,
was $150.00 per head. ,
SOIL STIMULANTS AND
HOW TO USE THEM
(By 3. C. McAmis, Division of Exten
sion, University of Tennessee.) -Temporarily,
soils may be made to
Increase in production and at the same
time decrease In plant food. In fact.
bumper crops of grains are always ac
companied by maximum outgo of fer
tility. There is four times as much
plant food In a hundred-bushel corn
crop as in one of twenty-five.
Intensive tillage, deep plowing, thor
ough cultivation, all Increase crops,
because they make plant food avail
able, but they, add no plant food to the
soil. They help to take it away.
Fertilizers often enable crops to
take out more potash, phosphorus, and
nitrogen, particularly nitrogen, than the
fertilizers themselves contain. They
may increase production, but decrease
total plant food.
Two tons of limestone should be ap
plied to the majority of acres in Ten
nessee. It places potash and phos
phorus in reach of plants, but it adds
none to the soil. It does not even add
nitrogen, unless legumes are intro
duced to the cropping system to be
plowed under or fed and the manure
returned to the land.
Those things are good: intensive til
lage, fertilizers, lime all have a place
soil-building. Making plant food
available is the farmer's business. So
Is making soils durable and perma
nent. Worn soils are the natural re
sults' of placing fertility in reach only
soil-robbing crops grains, corn,
cotton, tobacco, etc. Soll-building crops
have not received their share of the
benefits. . .
It is a necessary thing to make
plant foods available by all possible
agencies, but they should be directed
first toward the Increased production
of soil-building crops; red clover espe
cially, and then to grains. It is more
important to have ideal preparation of
the soil for fall-sown clovers than it
Is for spring-planted corn. Fertilizers,
which in the past have been saved re
ligiously for wheat and corn, should be
applied generously to peas, beans, red
and crimson clover. So should lime.
When farmers decide to feed their
oils before they demand the work
of producing a corn crop, Instead of
waiting until afterward to replace the
soil fertility taken out fey the cere.
tben aolle will be durable,
