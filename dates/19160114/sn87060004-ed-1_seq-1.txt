Save your hair! Double its

If you care for heavy hair that
glutens with beauty and is radi
ant with life; has an incompar
able softness and is fluffy and
lustrous, try Danderine.
Just one application doubles
beauty of your hair, besides it
mmediately dissolves every par-
tide of dandruff; you cannot
havo nice, heavy, healthy hair
fyou have dandruff. This de
structivo scurf robs tho hair of
its lustre, its strength and ita
very life, and if not overcome it
produces a fevenshness and itch
ing of tho scalp; the hair roots
famish, loosen and die; then the
hair falls out fast.
If your hair has beon neglect
ed and is thin, faded, dry, scrag
gy or too oily, got a 25-cont bot
tlo of Knowlton'a Dandorine at
any drug store or toilet counter;
apply a little as directed and ten
minutes after yon will say this
was the best investment you ev
er made.
We sincerely believe, roard-
ess of everything else advertis
ed, that-if you desire soft, lus

sermon was. "Peter's Sermon at
Pentecost."
In commenting upon Peter's bold
nois In condemning the mob-spirit
manifested In the Crucifixion of
Christ, the speaker took occasion to
refer to toe lawlessness that has ex
isted in this eeotion. He severely
arraigned mob-violence in all forms
and branded as cowardly the aots of
men, who, under the cover of the
night, would pull a mask over tbelr
faces and go forth to commit deeds
ot violence.
He called upon all law-abiding
people everywhere to set their faces
like Hint .against alt snob lawless
ness, and said that If the law-abiding
people everywhere would speak
out In condemnation of such aots.
that it would have a most salutary
effect In the suppression of lawless
ness and In the restoration of law
and order.
The speaker said that many other
things that have a practical appli
cation In the lives of people today,
and taking it all In all it was one of
ttia strongest sermons ever deliver
ed here. Princeton Leader.

Stop using dangerous drugs

It'i horrible!
You're bilious, sluggist, con

vile, dangerous calomel to start
your liver and clean your bowels.
Here's my guarantee! Ask
your druggist for a 50 cent bottle
of Dodson's Liver Tone and take
a spoonful tonight. If it doesn't
start your liver and straighten
you right up better than calomel
and without griping or making
you sink I want you to go back
to the store and get your money.
Take calomel today and to
morrow you will fee! weak and
sick and nauseated. Don't lose
