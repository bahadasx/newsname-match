GENERAL HUERTA
OIEO LAST 1161!!
, ill EL PASO.
Former .. Jean Dictator Who
Succeeded PiesirJsnt TIadero
FORGAVE ENEMIES 021 DEATHBED
Hiu Private Secretary Says End Was
Hastened by Treatment by
American Government.
Kl Paso, Jan. 13 General Yictori
ano liuerta, former dictator and provi
sional president of Mexico, died at
8.o5 o'clock last night. His death had
momentarily been expected since yes
terday afternoon.
General liuerta signed his last will
last nifiht following the administra
tion of tho last Catholic rights. He
ashed his lawyer to say that he hud
forgiven his enemies.
This afternoon Gen. Alex Itobles,
private secretary to tho general, ia
aned the follow ins:
"In the actual moment of gravity
in General Jiuerta's condition, I only
wish to state regarding the cruel and
unjust treatment given to him by tho
United Stales government that the
treatment is responsible for bis pres
ent condition.
"When he was president of Mexico
he gave all guarantees to Americans,
regardless of tho many diliiculties he
had met with in his administration.
"In this country he was thrown in
jail liko a common criminal and hia
health completely broken down, caus
ing his death."
Huerta's friends have eulogized
him and declared that lie was the Na-polt-on
of Mexico; his enemies have
denounced him as the most unscrupu
lous dictator Latin America aver
knew, as the murderer of President
Madero, a traitor to his country, uz'h
nian become rich by despoiling: his na
lion's treasury:. -
But this has been conceded by en
emies and friends alike that he was
one of (he-strorRAst. men that Mexi
co bits SATii.iii recent years.
'-His Vtrenstli wai armed strength;
an army man all his life, lie believed
In vigorous' inoasures or repression.
The justice of most, of these mea.;
lies h:ts been assailed by his oppon
ents, lint his Bittrporters have pro
claimed them as absolmely necessary
to instill peace in Mexico.
..m for seventeen mouths liuerta,
as provisional president of Mexico,
held his power in a country torn by
internal strife. During that time be
flagrantly insulted the United States,
which had refused to recognize him.
When be finally left Mexico he was
repined to bo worth Troin $6,000,0n0.
to $I5,iii)0,H)0.
His rise was all the more startling
in view of his early upbringing. Yic
torlnno Hucrta was a full blooded
Indian. He was born in Colollati,
statu, of Jalisco, December 23, 1S"4.
Huerta's. parents .were peons of the
lowest class. The boy. dressed 1st a
cheap cotton tunic, and without, shoes
or hai. wits like thousands of Indian
boys in Mexico, playing in the din,
and living chielly on beans. ' '
However, the village priest taught
him to read and write, and it was
this fact which gave liuerta his
chance to enter the army and his rise
was the gradual advancement of an
armv o'licer.
"THIRD FLOOR BACK."
The following are some comments
on the play, "The. Passing of the
Third Floor Back," which Kdward A.
Mead will recite Sunday evening in
the Second Congregational church:
''Entertainment too delightful to de

Pres.1!.'
' One of the most striking charms
i? its homely simplicity. A beautiful
little dramatic tract. Its mystery is
the simple magic, fresh air, cleat
water, a warm hami-elasp, a child's
laugh, the everyday magics." The
Globe, New York.
"A play wilh a message a play
which might bo made to serve the
purposes of practical morality more
usefully than many sermons." The
New York Times.
"In some respects the most remark

has seen the light of day for five bun

BRONCHITIS SUFFERER
Cured by a Simple Remedy.
Columbus, Ga. "I am telling every
body what Vinol has done for my
husband. He had a bronchial cough,
his system was run-down and
I felt sure he would die. Mis father
insisted on his trying Yinol, and 1
am fo thankful he did, because if
cured his cough and built him up.
My doctor highly recommends it and
raid he could not take anything bet
ter." Mrs. Thomas Monk.
Yinol, you know, contains the real
cod liver curat vo extract, together
with peptonate of iron. and beef
peptone, it enriches and revitalizes
the blood and conveys to the system
the vital elements necessary to
strengthen the body and throw off the
disease. That is the reason it .was
so successful in Mr. Monk's case.
Anyone in Bennington who has
bronchitis, a chronic, cough, or needs
building up, may try a bottle of Yinol,
with tho understanding that his
money will be returned if he is not
satisfied. AY. U Gokay, Drtnreist.

CARRANZA TROOPS
ANO
KILL
FOILS'
Slayers of American Miners Wil
L Punished
NOT YET PACIFIED
Secretary Lansing Says Murdered
Miners Had Been Warned to
Keep Out of the Country
Washington, Jan. H Eliseo Ar
redimdo. embassador designate of
the de facto government of Mexico,
called at the stale department yester
day and personally ussured Secretary
Lansing that Carranza troops had
betn dispatched to western Chllhua
hua with orders to kill or capture all
the bandits concerned in tho slaying
of American citizens. He said every
Carranza soldier in not them Mexico
would be pressed into service if nec
essary to achieve tills purpo;-.e.
In a statement later, Mr. Arredondo
declared that the men who lost their
lives had attempted to reach their
place of business before complete con
trol of the legion had been accom
plished by Carranza forces. He said
iv had been given permission, at
their own request, to pass through
the Carranza lines, although the
Americans had been warned to keep
out of territory In which gurllla war-
faro was in progress.
Mr. Arredondo went to the state de
partment, at the close of a day dovot
ed largely in oiricial circles at Wash
ington to. tho Mexican situation.
President Wilson conferred with
Secretary Lansing and discussed the
subject 'with callers. Me is under
ttond to have told some of the latter
that the Chihuahua mine employes
had teen punished and hat if proper
go into Mexico.
During the day Secretary Lansing
made it clear that the United States
would expect from tho du facto gov
ernment evidence that the murderers
h.id been pnnishde and that if proper
teps were not taken an nsue might
arise between the United States and
' Carranza administration. This
statement. v.ch considered significant
of the (Ictrrminalioii of the- United
States to enforce protection of its citi
zens lu Mexico. Tito secretary added
another warning to Americans in
Mexico to leave districts "where there
is revolutionary troob'e."
In c ongress again yesterday intense
indignation at the Mexican outrage
cn Americans in Mexico va; reflect
ed.. Senator Levis of Illinois, demo
crat, introduced a resolution to au
thorize the Fending of armed forces
of the United States into Mexico to
protect American eiuzi ns and their
propirty. Me asked that it lie over
without action for the present and
this was clone without debate.
Representative Siayden of Texas,
demccrat. made a speech in tho
Mouse declaring tho time had come
for pan-American action to rent ore
peace in Mexico. He insisted that only
the nummary execution of the bandit
murderers .would satisfy the people
of the border states, Representative
Moss of West Yirginla, republican, in
troduced a resolution proposing to
send a sufficient force of the army to
Mexico to capture the murderers and
tho dispatch of warships to Mexican
waters to co-operate with the army
and remain there until the persons
and property of American citizens
weie safe.
How Vermont 'Hens
Won the Championship
of America
All loyal Yennontcrs have noted
with considerable pride the high
place which Yermont poultry breed
ers have always taken when their
fowls compete with those of other
States. C. A. Crumnton, Jr., of St.
Albans, Yt., one of the prize winners
in the Storr's International Laying
Contest last year in a letter to C. S.
Pago of Hyde Park gives a suggestion
as to how ho did it. He writes: "I
feed Page's Green bone in moderate
quantities to breeding stock, layers
and young chickens and consider it
an Important item in developing and
improving my heavy laying strain.
My pen won second prize and cham
pionship of America (all breeds, 100
pens) at Storr's Internationa! Laying
Contest last year."
Poultrymen desiring to emulate the
example of Mr. Camptou wiil do well
to send 54.00 to Mr. Pago and procure
a 200-lh. barrel of his Green Cut Bone
Meat. On receipt of check, cash, ex
press, or postal money order tho
geeds will be sent freight paid to al
most any station.

ROOSEVELT ASSAILS PRESIDENT
Colonel
Which
Denounces Wilson Policy
He Declares Responsible
For Outrages.
Washington, Jan. 14. Dopite tho
outburst of indignation in Congress
over the killing of Americans in Chi
huahua, and the demand made. In
Congressional resolutions for armed
intervention in Mexico for the protec
tion of Americans and other foreign
ers. President Wilson tonight had not
changed his Mexican policy and was
opposed to armed intervention.
To Senators and others who cah..
at the White House today and saw
the President about the situation, he
said that this Government was look
ing to tho Carranza Government to
pursue, capture and punish the ban
dits who are responsible for the
massacre of tho Watson mining par
ty, whose bodies were taken to El
Paso last night.
New York, Jan. 14. Colonel Theo
dore Roosevelt gave it as his opinion
yesterday that' tho regular army
should l sent to Mexico at once in
view of the latest outrages, In order
to give protection to American citiz
ens there and prevent other murders.
Me suggested that General Leonard A.
Wood, who "did the job in such flue
shape in Cuba," was the man to lead
tho expedition.
Tho Colonel explained his attitude
in an interview granted nt his home
in Oyster Bay. Me was bitter in his
denunciation of President Wilson be
cause of his "watchful waiting" poli
cy, which, he asserted, had borne its
legitimate fruit?.
Me also accused the President of
dickering for tho German-American
vote in connection with the subma
rine settlement, and asserted that the
administration in warning Americans
to leave Mexico had copied the tactics
of the German Embassy in warning
Americans not to sail on the Lusitan
h:. As a result of the administration's
policy of weakness, he said, the coun
try had ahead of it an evil day of reck
oniiig when the European war was
was ended.

CHAUTAUQUA THIS YEAR
Miss Grace Hershey Working the
Village This Week for Pledges
The Chautauqua workers are plan
ning early for Chautauqua this year
and Miss Grace Hershey, the travel-"
lug representative of the Peun.syl
vania circuit is in the village this
week verifying the pledges made last
August of those who will contract
for tickets for the coming season.
This does not mean that those who
signed for tickets are required to pay
for them at this time. But there w .
still a shortage last season aft r the
pledges for tickets were made and as
it is necessary that 725 tickets be
sold before the contract can be made,
Miss Hershey is endeavoring to find
signers for those which remain.
At six o'clock last evening she had
only 38 tickets remaining to be sold
out of over a hundred two nights be
fore, which shows that Bennington
appreciates the Chautauqua and is
willing to pay for it, 687 having sign
ed thus far If. Miss Hershey can
make up these 38 Friday and Satur
day attention can then be directed to
the program and local arrangements
without the annoyance of the commit
tee worrying over going into debt af
ter it is over.
There is some confusion regarding
the function of the guarantors this
year as compared to last. Last year
the guarantors agreed to take all tha
unsold and be-
.A. Is each guarantor had to
'""NvU to maKe up tne cie-
ficieiicy. A TXvear the guarantors
are not to hae the tickets which re
main over, thus making those who
would attend on the generosity of the
guarantors buy tickets for them
selves. The guarantors this year are
simply -i make up any deficiency legi
tlmafel "used by the removal of any
pledgois i'oni town or because of
death ol any signor.
It is evident from the way tickets
have gone the past week that the S3
remaining can be easily taki-u care of
if persons interested will drop a post
card, care of General Delivery, to
Miss Hershey, specifying how many
tickets they will require. This an
nouncement is especially for out-of-
town people who will enjoy this sea
son's program but whom Miss Her
shey cannot see during her stay in
the village. A postcard with name,
address and number desired will be
sufficient for tho present purpose,
cash not being necessary In payment
till tho Chautauqua opens next sum

CETTINJF, CAPITAL

TENE6R0
IS OCCUPIED
Montenegrins Yield to ustrians
and Arm'stice Is Arranged
SERBIA MAY ALSO SURREHDFR
Austria Mf king Effort to Placate tho
Serbians Who Did Not Flee
From Country.
Vieuna, Jan. 14. The Austrian
troops have occupied Cettlnje tho
capital of Montenegro and the armis
tice between tho Austrlans and Mon
tenegrins is In effect.
It Is expected here that peace terms
will be arranged between Austria and
Montenegro and Serbia, Austria deal
ing in Serbia with the faction . that
has remained at home and submitted
to the Teutonic Invaders.
The portion of the Serbian poople.
who have fled into Greece, Albania
and Rumania, Is variously estimated
at from a quarter to a third. The
Austro-Germans are making efforts to
provide homes and food for the Ser
bians remaining in the country..
Whole regiments of the invading
army have been employed In rebuild
ing houses damaged by artillery fire
and also the large number of villages
which were destroyed by the Serbians
themselves in their rotreat.
The Serbian epppe" r.r.d coal mines
are being reopened and will furnish
employment for the natives who are
willing to work for the invaders and
wheat and beef are being brought
from Bulgaria and Rumania.
London', Friday, Jan. 14 Another
decisive stage in the Balkan situa
tion has been reached, with Monte
negro cow following Serbia In virtual
absorption by the Invading forces. It
was learned last night that Austria
and Montenegro had come to an arm
istice, this being conr.trued as tho.laBt
act of the little country after having
its capital, CetlnJ, dominated by th
Austrian capture of Mount Lovceri.
Whether King Nicholas will-continue
the unequal struggle 13 considered
doubtful here, but the accepted view
among the best ported men in London
is that Montenegro has practically
passed under Austrian control. The
chief significance cf this does not lie
in the small territorial acquisition,
which is less than Serbia, but in Mon
tenegro's Adriatic front, lying along
side the Austrian main offensive na
val station of Cattaro, where yester
day's dispatches announced the entire
Austrian fleet, Including three dread
noughts. Is assembled and from which
the recent naval raid was made
against Italian transports going to th
relief of Serbia. ,
This further extension of Austria's
Adrlaic front, with the dominating na
val centre of Cattaro, is viewed as
further tending toward realization of
Austria's object of making the Adri
atic an Austrian Bea and thus check
ing Italy's ambition to make it an Ital
ian sea.
