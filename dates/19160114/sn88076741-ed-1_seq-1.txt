WAR,
Some fighting between the Feeneh and
Oermaas in FrMice resulted in a small
advantage to the Germans.
Alter a heavy battle, theBussiaasand
Germaaa are resting in Russia. There
is talk of losses by the Russians of £0,000
men with some advance in territory.
PartkMilacs of this fighting in the far
east are laeking, both sides oefnuaing
from saying much except to admit that
there has been a great battle.
The allied armies have evacuated the
Galipoli peninsula. They claim to have
embarked without losb of men or guas.
This ends another disasterous campaign
for the Allies. So far in this war, the al~
lies have been more successful on the
defensive rather than on the offensive.
A large dre&dnaugbt, "King Edward
VII," has been sunk by a mioe without
loss of life, but dispatches fail to give
the location.
Earl Kitchener is the authority for
the statement that five Genman EUbmar
ines tried to get at« portion of the Brit
ish fleet that was exercising near the
Scotch coast, but because they got en
tangled in the steel nets, two were suuk
and three surwndened.
Submarines are active in the Mediter
ranean. A number of ships have been
sunk and most ships are now going the
Jong way around the Cape of Good Hope
zathar than through the Suez canal.
Austria has praetieally acceded to the
demands of 'the (7. S. and promises to
«iak no more unarmed ships without
warning. The sinking of the "Persia"
settlement is complicated by the fact
that so far no one has testified to seeing
the submarine which is supposed to have
done the sinking.
The vote in the British parliament on
the question of conscription was over
vrhelmingly in favor of forcible recruiting
and is now on the second reading with a
prospect of passing by a still greater ma
jority.
The general tone of onr own Congress
points to "prepardness' but serins to
differ considerably as to manner and de
gree. While it iB very probable that the
army and navy will be enlarged and a

SUBMARINES AND
AEOROPLANES IN WAR.
Science and invention have made many
changes in the weapons of war, but per*
haps the resulta of the inventions of the
new air craft and the new sea oraft have
been regarded by the world with more
curiosity than any other modern means
of destruction.
Until tried in actual service the im
agination could hardly conceive any
thing more destructive than the secret
foe from under th9 depths of the sea or
rain of bombs from the skies.
But^while science and invention con
struct the most devilish weapons for
destruction, science and invention are
also equally oroficient in providing de
fence. T:'"-
When the heavy, rifled cannon were
constructed, masonry and concrete walls
Were
made to crumble add fall like card
board, but now we have seen millions of
men facing each other in. lines but a few
hundred feet apart, in ttenches, practi
cally immune from the big guns.
When long range muskets were
brought into use and these supplement
ed with quick-firing, machine guns that
squirted musket balls ie steady stream
even the military experts declared that
the day of close fighting between large
bodies of troops bad gone, because one
or the other of these bodies would be
annihilated before they could come to
gether. And yet to-day the opposing
with bayonets and hand grenades and
have even added the anoifnt slings and
bow-guns with which to throw the gre
nades.
The aeroplanes and submarines have
been a distinct failure so far as methods
of wholesale destruction. As destruc
tive weapons they have as yet only prov
en of incidental value. The aeroplanes
are very use tul as scouts but the "raids"
on peaceful cities have resulted in but
little loss of life and no serious destruc
tion of property, and on the other hand
they have roused a sentiment of horror
and hostility that far outweighed any
military success.
The history of the submarine is much
the same except that it has not proven
of special value ia some other sphere
like the aeroplane.
The sinking of about one in a thou
sand of English merchant ships has not
interfered but very little with sea tran
sportation while the sinking of unarmed
passenger ships has created a general
feeling against the inhumanity of the
acts, so that even Germany and Austria
have practically said that they would do
so no more.
As fighters the submarines have not
AS yet distinguished themselves. The
British navy has been busy ever since
the war began, hunting the German
usbmarines the submarines have not
hunted for the British cruisers and des
troyers, while no British submarine has
passed through the Kiel canal.
Many navy men before the war were
arguing that the building of more dread
naughts was useless because the big
leviathans would be at the mercy of the
little submarine, but we do not hear
that the building of dreadnaughts has
been abandoned on account of the ex
ploits of the submarine in the pieBent
war.
What a two or three thousand to
submarine with a live thousand mile
radius of action might do his perhaps
still a question, and it is still unsolved
as to the destructive powers of a vast
fleet of aeroplanes each of which can
carry tons of bombs, but the present
types are no more valuable than many
other branches of war service?
The weak plaee in all these war con
trivances is that while they may be de
structive to the enemy, nothing has yet
been invented that provides absolute se
curity to the warrior machinists who runs
them. The submarine is blind, and
must show itself at least once before it
ti
sort of terrible machine that will be so
awful in its effects that thereafter.ttif
world will be afraid to goto.wiy ttttt.
that machine has not yet been built A0t-1
withstanding theeea devilBend the viil-!
tures of tile air.
ROOSEVELT AND ftRYAN
The two most prominent persottditiatli.&
in} American politics are Messrs. Rpqrt|'
velt and Bryan.
Undoubtedly each of these men /'hav#
a stronger personal following than
any other prominent politician.
As presidential candidates, in.Jpur
opinion, neither can be successful? r.
Bryan's three failures eliminate&r his.
chances while Mr. Roosevelt's remark?
able strength at the last election only
proved his weakness by also sbpwing th^'
tfrtngtbof biso|^x»ition.
Messrs Roosevelt and Bryan may be
king-makers but they can never be kings.
In history they will possibly be counted
among such men as Daniel Webster,
Henry Clay, and James G. Blaine, all of
whom were too great men to be elected
presidents though all were ambitious.
And just at present, with war clouds
all about us, the American people want
a conservative rather than a radical at
the helm. We want a strong man there,
but not too strong.
AMEND THE STATUTE.
By looking over the District court pro
ceedings at Cavalier last week it seems
to us that there should be a better way
of disposing of legaljsquabbles than call
ing together a large number of men,
as was the way many years ago.
Every case that came up for trial or
was continued on stipulation could have
been heard and decided in chambers by
Judge Kneeshaw and the county saved
hundreds of dollars. We understand
that certain cases have to he tried by a
jury under the present statutory l.iwt?.'
But why not amenu these 1
-•.
•"•n
Just why eithei of these men
mand so much political strength is.'W
pdycological question that perhaps migtjji
be answered differently by different olii
servers, and perhaps from the politieat
point of view. Our own answer is that:
the power of Mr. Bryan is duem»t»
ly to bis personal magnetism while thit"
of Mr. Roosevelt comes from hia strong'
individuality. We are aware that thesiK
answers themselves need explanation
be complete, but are definite enough a|
we generally use the terms, to show th$
difference between the two men.
Both of these men have been and may
again be oandidutes for the presidency^,
Mr. Bryan with practically a united: def*
mocratic party behind him has failed
twice and with a disunited party once.
Mr. Roosevelt with an independent
following failed but succeeded in defeat^
ing the republican party candidate. .1
These observations are .made,-ait
time because both these gentlemen are
in the fight for power during the coming
presidential year,
Mr. Bryan will in all probability 6(
poHe the renomination of Mr. Wilson^
while it ifuyet a question whether A(r
Roosevelt will attempt the nomination
of himself or simp'y seek to name the
nominee.
Party leaders on both sides acknow
ledge thejpossibility that the direct bp
position of these men may mean defeat
at the polls a..candidate not accept
able to them and are watching the
movements of both Mr. Bryan and Mr.
Roosevelt with more or less anxiety*,..
a ws so this
will not be necessary. We question if
there were any clients there who would
not rather have had the judge settle
their cases than a jury if it was left to
them to decide.
There was a time in this county when
court lasted a full month twice a year
But this was in the early days when
everything was new and we were strang
ers to each other. This is the case with
all new countries. But as people get
settled down, and disturbing elements
get weeded out there is very little squab
ble that ie not settled locally. The pro
hibition law has added some business to
the profession but the accused are gen
erally guilty and plead accordingly.
F. H. Sprague of Grafton, chairman of
the Republican state central committee,
has issued a call for a meeting of the
committee at Faigo on the 25th of Janu
ary. This is the first move in this at^te
for the coming presidential campaignf
and from now on, the political machinery
will be busy. The Democrats have UuI
several social gatherings to talk over
matters, but the more they meet, uie
more they disagree, as i^ seems to an
outsider. Chairman Sprague, it ia un
derstood, baa worked outf a plan for the
eeleetion of candidates for ^Blegates to

'DUAL IS NOT" "DOUBLE*
The railroads of this state are assessed

The Tax 'Commissioners discov
ed that some, of the lands owned by the

be ele?ator companie8 appealed to the
aupreons court and got a decision from
learned .body, to the effect, that
[fwhile the railway and the elevator
companies were each being taxed on the
same lands and while such taxation was
"dual" taxation, yet 'it was not "double"
taxation. We see by this week's papers
that the elevators have asked a rehear
ing, probably they are curious to find
out the distinction between "dual" and
"double"—when as matter of fact the
state and county get two taxes from one
piece 6f land.
seems to be on the slump in Mr.
Brueggei's political predictions. It is
soma time now since the committeeman
announced that U. S. Treasurer John
Burke would cast his hat in the U. S.
senatorial ring, but no Word comes as
yet from the former governor, that .be
would, do so. The elective franchise is
not limited to postmasters and there will
likely be a few others voting at the next
election.—Park River Gazette, (Demo
cratic.)
The vote for church union in the Win
nipeg Presbytery, which includes all of
Manitoba the vote stood six to one in
favor of the union. There were only
two congregations that stood out for re
maining separate, Stonewall and Kildo
nan, the two oldset congregations in the
province, the other twenty six went
strongly in favor of consolidation.
The women of Manitoba are now as
sured a vote according to petitions
on file with the provincial government.
There are petitions with 38,551 signat
