Obituary of Leroy Scott.
Leroy Scott was born in Black Hawk
Co., Iowa, March 26th, 1875 and came
to Dakota with his parents in March,
1883. About 1893 he came to mton.
On April 25tb, 1898, he enlisted in Co.
D., 1st S. D. Inf. Volunteers and
served during the Spanish American
war. After returning to Canton he
remained here until 1912 when he
went to Montana and homesteaded,
and being in poor health be came
to Canton for treatment but it was of
no avail as death came on Jan. 4th.
His wife died several years ago. Two
young daughters, several brothers
and sisters are left to mourn his early
death.
The movie operator out at Alexan
dria saw about a million "Diamonds
from the Sky" last Thursday night
when the serial film caught fire and
went up in smoke together with two
other reels. He was fortunate to es
cape uninjured and the fire was pre
vented from spreading by the fire
proof coop. The damage will reach
nearly $1000 says the Herald as the
serial films are expensive. .»jr

Death of Howard James.
The funeral of Howard James, the
little son of Mr. and Mrs. Harvey
James, was held at the family home
in West Canton on Saturday, Jan. 8th
Rev. Thurston of the M. E. church of
ficiating.
Little Howard, altho never a robust
child was a happy, cheerful little fel
low until dire disease claimed him,
and in spite of medical aid and ten
der nursing the grim reaper severed
the thread thai bound him to his
earthly home and friends and on Jan.
5th at the Sioux Falls hospital the
candle of life burned out and the
spirit of little Howard was wafted
back to God who gave it.
Left to mourn the loss of this little
son and brother are a loving father
and mother, four brothers and three
sisters to whom at this time it is hard
to see the silver lining to the cloud
that has come over their home.
Rest sweet flower in thy cradled
tomb
Rest til the trumpet of the Lord
shall sound
