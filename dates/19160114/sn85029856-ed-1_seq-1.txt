Liberal's Population Record
In a recent compilation of popula
tion statistics, J. C. Mohler, secretary
of the state agricultural department,
gave the name of every town in Kan
sas with a population of l.OOOormore.
Liberal ranks fifty-six in a list of 132
towns, and the population Is given at
2314 The figures of the 1IH)5 and 1815
censuses are given. In 1905 Liberal
had a population of 5.K), which will
figure an increase of nearly 440 per
cent for the ten years, or 44 percent.
Increase annually. Figured on a per
centage basis Liberal made about the
best showing of any town in ttie state
during the last ten years. Another
evidence that Liberal is the best town
in the world. However, the popula
tion of this hamlet will be batting
right along 'the 10,000' mark in 1925.
Watch what we tell you.
Recognizing a
Kansas Democrat
Henry Allen, in the Wichita Bea
con, December 23: Some comment
has been created in Washington by
the unusually line committee assign
ments which have gone to Congress
man Jouett Sliouse of the Seventh
Kansas District. One of the places
on the important committee on bank'
ing and currency was awarded Mr.
Sliouse in addition to several other
4nrf nArf-.ant. aNirnmiknt.fl
Wn ma - II.. I. ....... ' .
TT man Shouse will regret these dist inct-
Ions. When Congressman Shouse
first came to Kansas a few years ago
from Kentucky and broke into the
state, politics through election to the
State Senate there was a disposition
to take him lightly. lie is a hand
some sort of a thoroughbred Ken
tuckian who seems to be out for a
good lime. The more the people of
Kansas came to know or Congress
man Shouse the more tltey were
forced to realize that he not only has
fine abilities, but a serious desire to
use these abilities In honest public
service. If the Seventh Kansas Dis
trict observes its congressman care
fully they will soon discover that he
is giving them earnest, modes', able
service for the sake of the service and
that he has no apparent knowledge
as to where the grandstand is located.

Plains Bond Issue Carried
The bond issue for light and water
works held last week at Plains result
ed in a vote of 140 for and none
against. That's the proper spirit to
show when it comes to the expendi
ture of money for civic improvements
and Is a guarantee of the' town's fu
ture growth and welfare. When a
bond issue can carry any town with
out a dissenting vote, the millenium
Is peeping around the corner. Much
credit Is due to Editor Calvert of the
Journal for his terna hammering
away at necessary improvements for
his town, and that the little burg is
full of the right kind of business men
goes without saying.
. Lee Harding of rout 2 transacted
business in the eitf -Saturday. The
Democrat acknowledges a call from
Mr. Harding and a renewal of faith
in its weekly visits.
Miss Ida Ferguson arrived last week
for a visit at the home of her cousin,
Mrs. David Curtis She returned
Sunday to her home in Enid, Okla
homa, going over the W. F. & . N. W.
by way of Forgan.
TO GET
OUT OF DEBT
. DO YOU KNOW of any way that is
more sure, than regular, systematic , saving
of a part of your income, that you may nib
ble off a part of your debt and gradually
wear it away?
REGULAR DEPOSITING
of an income andthe . paying of bills by
checks on this bank has helped others to
save more WHY NOT YOU?

store by the last of this week. S. F.
Flynn and Henry Rine, both of fon-
ca City. Oklahoma, have rented 'the
quarters formerly occupied' by the
Harris Cafe and are this week unload
ing their new stock. They liote to
he open for business by tomorrow.
The new firm will be known as the
Peoples Cash Grocery. They have re
modeled the interior of the building
they will occupy and have installed
shelves, counters and other fixtures.
They will find Liberal to be a good
town when they once get strung out
and ready for business.
L. O..McCroan, who has been con
ducting the Farmers Wagon yard for
some time, blew out of town last Sat-
nrriay after he had passed a number
of worthless checks, all belnu given
on the American National Bank.
The checks ranged all the wat from
five to twenty dollars, amounting in
"all to more than a hundred dollars.
McCroan's family Is still in Tucum-
carl. It Is thought he went to some
place near Fort Worth Tucunocarl
Diversity of Farm Enterprises
In most cases where studies on the
profits in farming have been ,made,
particularly in the oldest agricultural
districts, such studies Indicate that
the most successful farms are those
which have from two to four major
sources of Income; i. e., they have a
wellbalanced and diversified business.
In certain instances it may pay better
to iiave only one enterprise, but us
ually wlien one crop pays much better
than all others the production of it
increases rapidly and soon the price
falls to the point where other crops
or products are equally as profitable.
Diversified farming is often confused
with farming wlieie there is a lit tie
of everything and not much of any
thing. Either extreme lessens the
chances of success. When the price
of certain crops is very low then live
stock Visually becomes "desirable.
However, if the returns per a'.iimal
are poor, cash crops even at a low
price are essential. A well-balanced
business insures against losses and
provides a much better utilization of
the labor equipment.
Writing Some Insurance
Sam Albea, who recently moved
here from Guymon, is an insurance
solicitor of the hustling kind. He
represents the Guarantee Funl asso
ciation of Omaha, and during the
month 'of December wrote $5(1,000
worth of accepted business for his
company, thereby winning a cash
prize of 150 besides his regular com
mission. The company offered 1 his
prize to eacli agent writing at least
150,000 worth of policies during that
month, and Sam turned tht trick
notwithstanding the fact that he had
Just moved to Liberal the first of that
month and had considerable sickness
and other outside matters to attend
toduring that time. This is a mighty
good record and were we an official of
1 lie company we would in addition
vote him a brass medal as big as a
wash tub as an appreciation of his
Industry.

Some PastjHistory
of O. T. Wood
!
Last Sunday's Topeka Capital gave
the following extended writeup of O.
T. Wood, former sheriff of this coun
ty and now U. S. marshal for the
s'ale of Kansas. Not being familiar
with the history of tl.ecounty during
those stirring times, w-give the
wriieup as it appeared in the Capital,
and you who are familiar -with the
events mentioned can make the de
sired corrections Tor yourselves.
Here is the article:
When ".lack" Ilarrkon, United.
States marshal fnr the district of
Kansas,- resinned his position early in
the summer of 11)1 the state throtign
some hitch at Washington was with
out a marshal for one day. Then a
htavjset, rugged featuied man a
typical westerner came into the
United States marshal's office, re
moved his broad brimmed hat and
calmly began his duties as marshal.
"It's CM10 T. Woon," explained
those wno were acquainted anywhere
in southwest Kansas. "He's from
L'beral and was twice sheriff of Se
ward county, lie's lived I here most
of his life, Is prominent in .Demo
cratic politics and a close friend of
Senat.-r Thompson."
The westerner had. little to say, but
plenty to do. As soon as he ton if'
cha'georhis otllce he iippointed C.
C. Jackson, of Emporia, as his chief
deputy and, as far as was possible for
a public official, disappeared- from
public notice.
Some persons whose business took
them into Wood's office at first mis
took his reticence and were slow in
becoming acquainted with him.
Eventually they came to know him
and as the acquaintance grew Wood's
personality Impressed them.
Wood lias lived in Sewatd county
s'nre lie was a boy. His intimate
friends say ttiat his only worry In life
is that he may die before lie lias ac
quired enough land to bequeath each
of liis children a quarter section, be- '
sides a few sections for Mrs. Wood,
.lust now ids ranch In Seward county
contains only 1,500 acres of land, but
lie gives more of his attention to cat
tle raising than farming.
Because of his reticence, Tope k a
knows comparatively little about the
United States Marshal. His acquaint
ances know that lie has a dry sort of
wit, unexpected because of his un
emotional temperament and brevity
of speech. Occasionally the wit be
comes satire. Not long ago two (toy
ernmenl prisoners, one a cripple,
whom Wood was about to take td an
other state, escaped from a county
Jail by smashing a bole in the roof
with a window pole. When Wood-
came to the Jail to Investigate the
Jailor apologized . profusely saying.
"You told me to take good care of
them, Mr. Wood, so instead of lock-
