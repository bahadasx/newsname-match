WOMAN'S SPHERE.
They talk about n woman's sphere
As (bough It lind n limit.
There's not a plnec In earth or Jichtcii,
There's not n task to mankind given,
There's not it blessing or n woe,
There's not n whispered "yes" or "no,"
There's not n life, or death, or birth
Tfcftt lins n fenther's weight of north
Without n woman In It.

enough to throttle tio mighty Ohio at
Its flood stage and prevent what had
the word "Disaster" written In big,
bold letters on Its muddy bosom, and
ThVpeoplo along Its banks aro thank
ful that the cold weather came, al
though to many it meant suffering.
At 8 o'clock Friday morning the

Pittsburg 17.2, falling.
Davis Island Dam 10,7, falling.
Stoubcnvlllc 25.6, rising.
Parkersburg 26.5, rising.
