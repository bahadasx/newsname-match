An Interesting Account of the 'Progress
Highway, by Henry B. Joy, TresJdent of
To travel by motor car across
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Neb
raska, those great farm states
where much of the wealth of the
nation originates, daring or just
after a heavy rain, is to all in
tents and purposes impossible. If
it rains you stop where you are,
or. in the nearest town you are
lucky enough to reach, until it
stops raining and the roads have
dried off and been against dragged
to that boulevard smoothness
which characterizes the Lincoln
Highway in dry weather. That
is, if you are on a pleasure trip
you stop. If you are accustomed
to hardships and are making a
business of getting through, as I
was this year, you may go on,
making perhaps twenty-five miles
a day with prodigious expenditure
of gasoline and effort, driving
eighteen hours out of the twenty
four, constantly sunk to the run
ning boards in a mud called gum
bo, which is unknown to our East,
and which has been characterized
as being eighty per cent pure glue.
You can go on, wet, cold, sleeping
when you can in ditches or where
ever you may happen to be stuck
when night falls, eating when you

your car to a usage which ordi
nary driving would not give it in
years.
. There are not many people who
will do this. In fact,fduring the
terrible rains of late May and ear
ly June oi'this year, all across the
Middle West, our party was prac
tically the only one in motion,and
t wns sot primarily on a pleasure
trip. .;-'; : s
Yet the Lincoln Highway is
bringing ; better accommodations
along with .better rrad conditions.
,Iicrasf,iii, tourist, traffic alone
: f arrajni the proprietors along
main routes of travel in bettering
the conditions. With any luck,
you can sleep in a bed every night
of your journey between New
York and San Francisco, but you
must not be Sf-eamish if you want
to do it. Two years ago the trans
continental driver prepared to
camp out every night after he got
west of Omaha, Nebraska. ,
The change in conditions is
shown by one typical instance.
Far out on the edge of the Great
Salt Desert south of Great Salt
Lake, where the Lincoln Highway
clips a cautious edge from the
American Sahara, stands one of
those ancient stone structures
built as a station for the pony ex
press riders back in the days im
mortalized by Bret Harte and
T?minrtnn Thft old transcon-
tinental trail is dotted with these
Jl rolira nf a. dav when mail was re-
. m " J -
layed by daring riders and sweat
ing ponies from St. Joseph to the
Golden Gate. Every ten miles of
the western journey brings to light
one of these crumbling stone huts.
Tb . jne at Fish Springs, Utah,
differs in that it has been contin
uously occupied and kept in re
pair since 1853. It is now own
ed, and has been forty years, by a
character as typical of the old
West as the building he occupies.
Fish Springs, Utah, consists of J.
J. Thomas' ranch. J. J. Thomas
has lived on this ranch, surround
ed by salt flats and plains of vol
canic dust and rock, for fifty years,

SWade on This Grtit Trinscontinentit
the Association, in Scientific eAmtricen
summer gave the answer. Eigh
teen people were gathered In the
little stone express station. Si
cars stood outside. One was from
Oklahoma, one bore an Indiana
license, a third was from Salt Lake
City, two came from California,
ours from Detroit. All but our
party stayed for the night in the
building which increasing business
ha? forced Thomas to add to the
rear. We all took supper, we all
bought gas and oil, every crumb
of that dinner, every plank in
those building were brought by
those same ten mules from the
nearest railway 80 miles.
This is but one angle of what
the Lincoln Highway means to the
West. Innumerable examples
could be given. The answer to
this one is clear. Thomas is mak
ing more money than he ever saw
before, and he and others in the
same position, whether on the de
sert or in the city, arc good enough
business men to realize what has
caused this tremendous increase
in revenue, and are spending part
of it in the further improvement
of the road and in bettering the
accommodations which must be
offered to tourist. This is going
on all along the line in varying de
gree from New York to San Fran
cisco. The eastern end of the Lincoln
Highway, like eastern loads in
general, does not present much of
a problem. You can drive today
from 42nd St. and Broadway to
Chicago in 35 hours of driving
time if you want to push your car.
It is in the middle and far West
that the question of road improve
ment is a seripus one. The Lin
c In Highway in New Jersey may
be considered perfect; the Pennsyl
vania section is in the main good,
hard-surfaced road, well kept;, but
a few miles of the Lincoln High
way in Ohio remains to be Uird
surfaced. I have driven this sec
tion of the Lincoln Highway many
times, and so this year my trip
over the route started at Elkhart,
Indiana. From that city west to
Oakland, on the Golden Gate, I
did not drive 52 consecutive miles
without encountering either actual
road work in progress or sections
of road which gave certaiu indica
tion of having recently been work
ed. I know positively that I must
have passed 5,000 men at work on
the Lincoln Highway during the
23 days of my trip. I was im
pressed with the tremendous
amount of improvement which has
been achieved with the expendi
ture of the two and one half mil
lion dollars which have, according
to careful estimates, been used for
Lincoln Highway improvement
during the two years since the an
nouncement and dedication ot the
route. The last time 1 diove this
route I headed west by the com
pass, and the Lincoln Highway
was only an idea in the miuds oi
a few of us. This year I followed
a line of red, white and blue mark
ers straight through to the coast.'
I encountered gangs laying con.
Crete roads on the Lincoln High
way in Indiana at midnight under
the light of arc lamps; and across
this state, as in Iowa and Nebras
ka, the driver is almost given the
impression that he is traversing
what will be a railroad grade. For
steam shovel work is noticed mile
after mile across all of these states.
The hills are being cut off and
dumped into the valleys. Often
times the cuts are 30 feet deep, as
near Marshalltown, Iowa, and the
tills nearly as deep. All this work
is preliminary as deep. All this
flrork is preliminary to permanent
hard-surfacing. Lut lor all the
improvement, the Lincoln High
way is as yet nearly all natural
road from the Mississippi River to
the California line. Yet the ef
fort which is expended upon keep
ing the highway in perfect shape
is so great that it can be said now
that the Lincoln Highway trip in
dry weather would present almost
mo difficulties.
If the report be true that the
American people are drinking
less spirits and more beer and
wine than they drank a year ago
it is a distinct gain for temper
ance which everybody will ac
knowledge except the prohibi
tionists. -NOStates.

FROM THE PEOPLE.
Tha Mortgage Rtdemptlon Law,
Editor of the Bkacon.
I see by the Jackson Daily
News that our senator, Mr. Poin
dexter, has introduced a bill
making the two year exemption
clause in mortgages a law.
I believe he cannot do a better
thing for the people of Noxubee
county and the State of Missis
sippi than to have his bill passed.
In many cases it will save the
borrower from financial ruin and
will not hurt the lender.
You know the writer come from
Illinois where this has been the
law for many years. In the fi
nancial panic of 1893 one-half or
more of the farms were mort
gaged to eastern capitolists. The
amount per ac 0 loaned at that
time ran fro- twenty-five to
thirty dollars. Had those mort
gages been reclosed at that
time half of the farmers of the
state would have been ruined,
had there been no redemption
clause in the mortgages. Before
that law was passed I know of
thousands of acres sold under
foreclosure around ten and fif
teen dollars an acre. A personal
friend, and onetime partner of
mine, bad a beautiful farm of
about eleven hundred acres, with
a railroad station on it, and to
improve it, borrowed sixteen dol
lars an acre on it. A year or two
of too much rain and early frosts
damaged him. He got behind
and his farm was sold for the
sixteen dollars an acre, and to
day that same land is worth two
hundred dollars an acre.
It not only ruined him finan
cially but broke his heart and
sent him to a premature grave.
Another man with whom I was
acquainted, owned some thirty
thousand acres, and to help im
prove borrowed fifteen dollars an
acre. Bad crop seasons and low
prices for grain got him behind
and hi3 land was sold at the fif

teen dollars an acre. Today
that land is worth two hundred
and fifty dollars an acre. About
not being able to borrow money
with the redemption clause in
the mortgages, I don't think
there is anything to it. There are
millions of dollars in Illinois
banks to be borrowed at five per
cent with this clause in the mort
gages. The writer and you, Mr. Edi
tor, knows of some homes and
some families that would be
brighter and happier today had
that exemption clause been a
law in Noxubee county the last
year or two. F. A. T.
In Regard to Orchards.
This is the time of the year when
we should give our orchards a little at
tention. Pruning and planting new
trees should ibe done by the last of
February. The fight on insect pests
and diseaf e should begin now.
Begin by cleaning up burn all trash,
stalks and branches that have been cut
off. A winter cover crop should be
clover, oats, or rye, preferably a clov
er because of its soil building power.
Go after the peach tree bearer. Take
your knife and examine the base of the
tree carefully. The borer makes a
trinnel under the only effective reme
dy against this pest.
Before planting young trees examine
them carefully for the borer. The
peach tree borer is the larvo of a clear
winged math.
"Wormy" peaches is a very commoi.
trouble. For this pest spray with
arsenate of lead. Three pounds of the
paste to 50 gallons of water. The first
spraying is made just after the petals
fall and the second or third week later.
One of the worst diseases we have
is the apple and pear blight. It is
caused bv batteria. This disease is
held in check by pruning; cut off the
branches at least six inches below
where it is shriveled and burn.
If you need me to help plant your
orchard, prune, lay off terraces, etc.,
call on me; I am at your service.

Standing for the Right.
A canvass of the Senate by The
New York World indicates that
a large majority of that body
sustains the President in main
taining the rights of non-combatants
on the high seas. Only
a small minority believe that the
United States ought to surrender
a great principle of internation
al law and custom merely because
not to do so might prove trouble
some. To do so, says The New York
Evening Post, would mean "to
sanction pure terrorism as a sub
stitute for legitimate warfare:"
Throughout the operation
of the Alabama in our Civil
War, it adds, it never oc
curred to Admiral Semmes
to make the slightest depart
ure from that principle to in
crease the effectiveness of
his great campaign against
the commerce of the North,
tremendous as were the odds
in the face of which the Con
federacy was fighting.
The best evidence of the jus
tice of the President's position is
the fact that persistence in it fin
ally has brought Germany into
absolute accord with that princi
ple. No one need have any
doubt, that Austria will follow the
example of her more powerful i
ally.
The war has teen many inter
national laws go to smash on the
rock of natio ai necessity. But
no nation wishes to set itself as
an advocate of the cold-blooded
murder of non-combatant men,
women and children on the high
seas. Germany and Austria
might have cjntii ueo to do so if
the United States had rot made
the issue. But the issue made
and insisted upon it was inevita
ble that both wo j!d yu-ld to tne
naked justice of the President's
position. -N. O Stafo

A Man Poor, bat Rich.
Once in New England I was driving
with an old farmer and some of the men
of the neighborhood came under criti
cism. Speaking of a prominent man in
the villiige I asked, "is ho a man of
means?"
"Well sir," the farmer replied, "Ha
ain't got much money, but he's mighty
rich."
"He has a great deal of land then,"
I asked.
"No so, he ain't got much landj
neither, but still ho is mighty rich."
The old farmer, with a plowed smile,
observed my puzzled look for a moment,
and then explained:
"You see, he ain't got much money,
an i he ain't got much land, and still
he is rich because he never went to bed
owing any man a cent in all his life.
He lives as well as he wants to live,
and he pays as he goes; he doesn't owe
anything, and he ain't afraid of any
body; he tells every man the truth and
does his duty to himself, his family nnd
his neighbors; his word Is as good as a
bond, and every man, woman and child
in town looks up to him and respects
him. No sir. he ain't got much money
and he ain't got much land, but still
he's a mighty rich man, because he's
got all he needs and all he wants."
