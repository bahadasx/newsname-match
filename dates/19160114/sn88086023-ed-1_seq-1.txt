EL PASO, Jan.' 14. While soldier
with fixed bayonets are patrollng the
city and twenty thousand Mexicans
cowered Indoors in their quarters the
officials felt even martial law would
not curb the rage of citizens. More
outbursts similar to those of last night
are feared.
It is continually reported that cow
boys and miners are preparing a vol.
unteer regiment to avenge the Santa
Ysable massacre. The hospitals today
are filled with wounded Mexicans as
a result of riots which were quelled I
when the soldiers came. Even the
bellboys in hotels attacked Mexican
guests.
EL PASO. Texas, Jan. 14. Martial
l.'w has been declared in El Paso by
leneral John J. Perishing, comman
der at Fort Bliss. Four companies
of the DHh Infantry were ordered to
take charge of the downtown district
after it was apparent the police were
powerless to check the crowds. Lines
of troops four abreast swung through
the streets, establishing sentries on
the corners and in the middle of the
squares. The crowds thinned out
when orders were issued that no one
appear on the streeta without a per
mit signed by the provost marshal.
The search by American soldiers of
the Mexican quarters for armed Mexi
cans continued after midnight.
The provost guard returned from
the lower quarter of the city without
having found any armed Mexicans.
The meeting of a number of Am
erican mining men ended without de
finite action, it was said.
One hundred and fifty arrests had
been made by the police and it was
found that beyond a few broken heads
inflicted by the provost guard, when
resistance was offered, no Mexican
been iniured seriously.
The patrol of police proceeded alii
last night.

quarter came reports of fighting in
which knives were used. American
soldiers from Fort Miss participated.
Shortly before midnight the pottos I

OF ORDER.
DirkneNs will probably descend up
on Pendleton this evening as a result
of the Impairment of the plant of the
Pacific Power & Light tV by reason
of the cold weather. Householders
and others are warned to prepare
against the lack of electrical Illumi
nation hv- supplying tbrmsrlves with
Cftntttftft, l imps or other substitutes.
According to Dr. F. W. Vincent. lo
cal manager, the Walla Walla river
Is frozen over and the flume at the
power plant Is broken, thus shutting
off one source of ower At We
ed with Ice and the company has
been forced to generate Its current bv
steam pow-er alone. This steam pow -er
is sufficient during the daytime,
but Insufficient at night when the
lights are all In use Therefore. Dr
Vincent anticipates that by 4 or 5
o'clock this evening Pendleton may be
cut off entirely. For the past few
nights the lights have been very dim
and th conditions hve grown worse.
A.G. HAMPTON IS
SUPERINTENDENT
F
Board Last Night Elects Him Unan-imously--Has
Been Acting Super
intendent Since Last Spring.
HI6H PRINCIPAL IS CHOSEN
I.. P. Gambec, Teacher of Agricul
ture, Will Head the High School
Permanently ApiMntnwntM Are
Made at Special rScetkm of the
Local School Board.
Prof. A. C. Hampton, principal of
the Pendleton high school for the
past eight years and who has been
acting as head of the schools since
the resignation of Supt. J. S. lender
last spring, was last evening; unani
mously elected by the board to the
superintendency. L. P. Uambee.
teacher of agriculture, waa at the
same time chosen as principal of the
high school, ft position in which he
has been acting this year.
The board has had under consider
ation for some lime past a number of
applicants for the superintendent .
A special meeting was called last
evening for the purpose of discussing
the matter with the result that all
five members of the board voted for
the promotion of Prof. Hampton to
the position. Though men of high
standing in their profession had ap
plied for the position here, the board
preferred to accept a knowp. quanti
ty and at the same time recognize the
years of efficient service which Prof.
Hampton has given to this district.
The new superintendent Is ft na
tive son of oreon and practically his
entire life has been spent In this
state. His education for his profes
sion previous to coming to Pendleton
was recrtved at the Oregon State
Normal school at Monmouth and the
I'nlverslty of Oregon Since coming
here he has taken summer school and
correspondence work at both the
state university and Chicago univer
sity. Prior to his election to the prin
cipalshlp of Pendleton high school in
1907, he had taught four years in dif
ferent parts of the state. His sur
ceB in the conduct of the high school
here is too well known to need comment-
W hen he assumed charge the
Pendleton high school was not on the
accredited list of high schools at the
state university or other standard col
leges and now It ranks second to
none in the state outside of Portland.
As a "boy man" he has earned a rep
utation that is more than local.
Prof. Gambee. the new principal, is
teaching his second year in the Pen
dleton high school department of ag
riculture. He was graduated from
the Oregon Agricultural College In
1913. He came here with high rec
ommendations from that college ind
his election last night is evidence that,
these recommendations were merited.
