AND GREAT INTEREST MANI
FEST E D M ANY ARE ENTERING
TO TAKE SPANISH COURSE.
The night school opened most
auspiciously at the high school last
night and sixteen were enrolled. The
enrollment was not as large as It
would have been under better
weather conditions, but several have
telephoned Superintendent Richards
today stating that they desired their
names enrolled and would be there
at the next session.
Superintendent Richards in a few
opening remarks introduced R. A.
Heffner, president of the board of ed
ucation, who made a splendid talk
on educational lines. He was fol
lowed by Colonel Suggs and C. K.
Ringer, who injected more enthu
siasm into the assemblage. Super
intendent Richards stated this morn
ing that he was more than gratified
with the opening. It shows him that
people are interested in education,
and from the list enrolled last night
it will be observed that many .were
graduates of high schools and col
leges, but desire to brush up their j
rusty spots and are taking advantage
of the night school to do so.
Sessions will be held every Tues
day and Thursday nights throughout
the school year beginning at 7 o'clock

PROFESS ON
UNTIL OVERTHROW OF MADERO
GOVERNMENT HUERTA WAS
ALIGNED WITH ADMINISTRA
TIONS AGAINST REBELS.
Kl Paso, Tex., Jan. 1 1. General
Victoriano Muerta, former president
of Mexico, died at his home here last
night.
Plans are being formed today for
the burial in Mexico of the body of
General lluerta.
Genital lluerta was a professional
soldier, and as such be had, up to
the overthrow of President Madero,
been known for his loyal support of
the existing governments, lie fought '
loyally for President Porfirio Diaz
tiitil his fall, and when Diaz was no
longer chief executive, lluerta fought
for Francisco de la Rarrn, the provis
ional president. After Francisco Ma
dero was elected lluerta found it to
be his duly to support one who had
so long fought as a rebel. His loy
alty was not challenged until the
Felix Diaz revolution in Mexico City
in February, 1913, when the Madero
government was completely over
thrown and lluerta himself elevated
to the presidency.
When Pofirio Tdaz began his reor
ganization of the Mexican army,
Ifuerta was promoted captain of en
gineers, and while holding this rank
devised the plan for a Mexican gen
eral staff corps. During the ensuing
years lluerta saw much active serv
ice. In l'.tOl he left the staff and
took command of the infantry in the
campaign against the Y'aqui Indians.
After this campaign lie was again
put in charge of the general staff's
topographical work in Sonora. He
participated in subsequent Yaqui
campaigns and also in the campaign
in Yucatan against the Maya Indians.
As a reward for his Indian service
lluerta was given the rank of briga
dier general and once more detailed
to the general staff.
lluerta was the moving spirit In
the consummation of the plot that
resulted in the seizure of the person
of President Madero and his brother,
Gustave.
The assassination of President Ma
dero and his brother followed and in
the meantime lluerta, with the mili
tary behind him, had been recogniz
ed as the provisional president.
lluerta took office as provisional
president on February in, lfll3. Three
days afterward Francisco Madero,
one of his brothers, who had been
arrested with Mm, and Jose Maria
Pino Suarez, vice president under
Madero, were assassinated while rid-
ing under guard from the palace to '
the penitentiary.
This crime aroused a storm of In
dignation throughout the T'nited
States. In many quarters there were
demands for intervention, hut Presi
dent Taft, who was on the eve of
leaving office, decided to take no
action which might commit the In
coming administration of President
Wilson.
Immediately on assuming office
President Wilson refused to recog
nize lluerta as the head of the Mexi
can government In spite of the fart
that such recognition had been grant
ed by Great Britain. At the same
time the Maderistas rallied under
Venustiano Carranza, governor of
Coahuila, and Francisco Villa declar
ed against lluerta.
Throughout the winter the tension
between the United States and Mex
ico continued to grow more acute.
