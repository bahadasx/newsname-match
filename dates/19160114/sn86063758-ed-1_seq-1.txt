Magisterial Situation at Union Reviewed
by Man Wl)o Has Served
His People Well.
<2r>opiai trv The Herald and News.
Union, Jan. 13.?Former Sheriff J.
G. Long, Sr., of this county, Confederate
veteran, conspicuous in upholding
white supremacy during Reconstruction,
sheriff of his county for four
successive terms, then chief of police
of the city of Union, and then sheriff
of his county again, has issued a statement
on the magisterial situation at
Union, which is an intensely interesting
contribution to the ihistory of factional
politics in this state. Sheriff
Long's statement best speaks for itself.
It is as follows:
"Facts las to Magisterial Situation at
Union, S. C., for Union Townsjiip
-*nd County at Large,
Joseph Sanders, who was elected oy
the rvople in the general election in
August, 1914, forwarded to Governor
Manning, some time during August,
1915, his resignation to become effective
on December 1, 1915.
It seems that Governor Manning
took no action as to the appointment
of a successor for Mr. Sanders until
some time during the latter part of
November, 1915, when he addressed a
letter to Hon. J. A. Sawyer, the president
of the Union County Bar association,
in which he stated that it had
been reported to him that the Union
county delegation were hopelessly
disagreed as to a successor for Mr,
Sanders, and requested that Mr. Sawyer
call a meeting of the Union County
Bar association and recommend a suitable
and competent man to succeed
Mr. Sanders as a magistrate. This
meeting was called for this purpose
and all member^ of that association
were present, with t'ne exception of
Mr. A. C. Mann and Mr. Hamilton
Munroes, who asked to be excused from
the meeting on account of being applicants
for the position. At this meeting
the names of all applicants for
the position of magistrate were submitted
and resulted in myself receiving
the unanimous endorsement of this
association, of- which recommendation
irr.-mo^intoiv forwarded to Gov.
Tf ao '
Manning. It appeared, however, that
the matter of a successor for Mr. Sanders
nad never been submitted to the
Vnion county delegation. After receiving
the recommendation of the
Bar association, however, Governor
Manning did refer the matter to the
county delegation, who unanimously
endorsed the recommendation of the
Bar association.
Governor Planning failing 10 appoint
me within a reasonable time and after
-receiving lae recumiiicuuam/u vi
Bar association and the county delegation,
I made a trip to Columbia and
talked this matter over personally with
Governor Manning. Governor Manning
stated to me t'iiat he toad the
matter under advisement and would
make the appointment with the idea of
doing away with the political factionalism
that had existed in Union county
He later sent one of his private
detectives to Union and had him call
into consultation several parties ior
the purpose of recommending a successor
for Mr. San-ders as between Mr.
Colson and Mr. A. C. Mann. Several
J of the parties Governor Manning had
requested to be called into this consultation
refused to attend on account
of the fact that they were aware that
Governor Manning had made a special
request of the Bar association and
county delegation to recommend Mr.
Sanders' successor, and that I had been
unanimously endorsed by both parties.
In addition to the endorsement of the
Bar association and county delegation
1 ihad the endorsement of the most influential
and representative citizens of
the city of Union, as well as the coun^ty,
consisting equally of Bleasites and
-^Blnti-Bleasites.

night Of the esvine, ten miles,
I My home ?as^
above Union. I was, at that time,
clerking for Lynn & Co., sleeping in I
a back room of the store house. An j
old negro, by the name of Ed. Fernandes,
who was our butler, came to!
me about 2 o'clock of that -night se-1
cretly and made this statement: "I
went down to the Union league meeting
tonight, Marse Gid, and was initiated
into the order, and at the end of
the meeting heard the negroes blacklist
you, Mr. R. E. Brewton and Mr.
Charley Sims. I heard that Capt. Alf.
Walker, our negro captain, with his
militia were coming to kill you ali
tnn iorV> + " I
IVUlguu
I then dressed up and sent word to
Mr. Brew ton and Mr. Sims; and notified
several others to meet us well
armed. We went about half a mile
below town and waited for several
hours, but they failed to come.
We heard the next morning why
they failed to arrive. The negro militia
had started that night about twenty
or thirty strong, and when they had j
come as far as Upper Fair Forest Baptist
church they met G. Mat Stevens
and Ben Robinson, both old Confed,
rate soldiers (Mr. Stevens having lost
an arm in the war) coming towards
Union with a dray wagon loaded with
two barrels of whiskey. The negro
j-j
captain halted tftem ana aemanaeu i
some whiskey. Mr. Stevens told them
that the whiskey <lid not belong to
him, bat gave them a quart he had in
his pocket. When iMr. Stevens had
driven about forty yards from them
they ordered him to halt and a*: the
same time fired a volley into the wagon,
killing Mr. Stevens. Mr. Robinson
escaped and ran to the home of Mr.
John Scott for protection. The negroes
bursted "the heads out of the barrels
and all got drunk. That was the reason
they did not get to Jonesville. As
I ?r<rm ac thp news reached us I organ
ized a crowd of good men and we gathup
all the guns that belonged to the
negro militia and turned them over to
. rhe sheriff. We asked him to notify
Governor Scott, who was a carpet- bagger
from t'tie State of Ohio and had
armed these negroes.
In the course of a few weeks people
began to find out some of the negroes
who were in the murder scrape. A
number of them had barricaded themselves
in a house known as "the Yellow
House," near the Southern railway
tracks in Union. Deputy Sheriff Dan
Smith went to this house and demanded
that they surrender. Instead of
doing so they fired through the door,
killing him. This aroused the people
so much that I sent my Knight-Hawk
to Limestone Springs to notify *,he
Grand Cyclopse Capt. J. Bank Lyles
of Sout'n Carolina, and ihe ordered all
the clansmen that were organized in
Spartanburg and Union counties to report
to me at the "old hanging
ground," which they did, and by the
| efforts of this organization we brought
I law and order out of chaos in the
Piedmont section of South Carolina.
During t'je year of 1871 President
Grant declared the counties of Union,
Spartanburg, Laurens, Newberry, York
and Chester under martial law and
suspended the writ of habeas corpus
in these counties. He sent the United
Stafes troops to investigate and make
arrests of any members of the Klu
Klux-Klan they could locate.

^rassacre of the American Said to
Have Keen Ordered by One of
Villa's Generals.
I El Paso, Jan. 12.?Pablo Ix)pez, a
! Yaqui chief, and Gen. Reyna, two Villa
j gt-nerals, led the men who assassinati
ed a., group of American miners on
Monday near Santa Ysabel, (Mexico,
and the massacre was committed close
i in the wake of a Carranza troop train,
: according to information of the affair
i gathered tonight. Statements made by
' J. Gaudelupe Gardena, a conductor of
the train bearing the Americans, and
j Thomas B. Holmes, the only known
i survivor of the American party, indi
; cate that the murder of the United
! States citizens was deliberate.
i
I It was also learned that the total
%
! Americans slain numbered 19. The
bodies are now on the way to El Paso
from Chihuahua, west of which city
the massacre took place. A mass
meeting to protest against the failure
of Mexican authorities and against the
attitude of the United States governmen
on the Mexican situation, planned
for El Paso tonight, was postponed
until after the arrival of the murdered
mPTV , j
Conductor Gardena, in an affidavit
given to the British consul at Chihuahua,
said that the train bearing
the Americans was stopped by a de|
railed train in a cut. ilhis train is
! said to have been part of the equipment
bearing Carranza troops. The
conductor said that Gen'. Reyna held
the trainmen under guard while the
I Americans were robbed and shot to
death.
Details obtained tonight were to the
I pffect that a score of (Mexican armed
men attacked the train which was
bearing the mining men to mines
owned by the estate of Potter Palmer
of Chicago. There were some 200
other bandits grouped as reserve force
along the right of way of the railroad.
Holmes arrived in El Paso from Chihuahua
today.
Thomas B. Holmes, the sole foreign
survivor of the massacre, reached the
j border here about noon in a state of
collapse.
Lansing Calls on Carranza to Act.
Washington, Jan. 12. ? Secretary
Lansing, with the approval of President
Wilson, today dispatched to Consul
Silliman at Queretaro for presen|
tation to Gen. Carranza a note denouncing
the slaying of Americans
near Chihuahua by Mexican bandits,
an^ calling upon the head of the de
facto government for the immediate
pursuit, capture and punishment of the
perpetrators of the deed.
The note urged the sending of troops
to other districts where Americans are
in danger of losoing their lives or property.
At the same time the state department
ordered an investigation of the
murders with a view of determining
whether they resulted from the failure
of the de facto government to give
proper protection in a zone known by
it to be dangerous or whether the men
lost their lives' as the result of a
bandit outbreak which could not have
been foreseen.
Instructions to seek information on
this point were telegraphed to consu*
' - *- J
lar representatives in jueAicu auu cuvu6 i
tlie border.
In the note to Gen. Carranza the
killing of the Americans was described
as a dastardly crime, committed in
territory announced to be in control
of the Carranza forces.

THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY !
IS STEADILY AT WORK
COMMITTEE AGREES TO HOLI)
DOWN APPROPRIATION BILL.
I
.Measure Introduced to Give Governor
$.>0,000 For Prohibition Enforcement?Other
Mesures.
(By Jno. K. Aull.)
Snecial to The Herald and News.
Columbia, Jan. 13.?The ways and
means committee of the house of representatives,
which has in charge the
preparation of the appropriation bill,
met on the first day of the legislative
session and agreed that the bill which
the committee will present to the house
snail call for appropriations aggregating
not over two million dollars.
Following is the resolution which
was adopted by the committee:
"Resolved, That the total amount of
the appropriations to be contained in
the ways and means committee approA
priation bill for 1911 shall not exceed
S2.000.000.''
Should a bill lifited to $2,000,000j
reach final passage, it would mean a
curtailment of more than one-third in
tne estimates submitted by the various
deparments and institutions, and it
would carry something over four hundred
thousand dollars less than the
amount carried by the appropriation
bill at the session of 1915.
Prohibition Enforcement Costs#
A measure was introduced in the
house on Wednesday, however, to provide
a fund of $50,000 to be placed entirely
at the disposal of the governor
fv>.r t'no onfrvrrpment of the new prohi
bition law. The bill, presented by
Messrs. Crum, Wagnon and Sellers, is
as follows:
'Whereas, the people of South Carolina
in their wisdom and sovereignty
have voted for a law prohibiting the
sale of alcoholic liquors and beverages
in this state, and,
"TTT1 ? +.Vi ? r-> r) c- fnr til o on fnTPP
VV UCX ca&, Liic lunuc i\jx
merit of the liquor laws heretofore
have been derived from the profits accruing
from the sale of said liquors
and beverages by the various dispensaries
in the state, and,
"Whereas, it is the express desire of
the people of the state that said law
prohibiting the sale of such alcoholic
liquors be enforced,
"Be it enacted by t'ne general assem
bly of the State of South Carolina: I
"Section 1. That the sum of $50,000
be and the same is hereby appropriated !
* - j ?
to be used by the governor at nis ais-;
cretion for the purpose of the enforce-1
ment of the law prohibiting the sale j
and importation of intoxicating |
liquors and beverages within the
state.
"Sec. 2. That this act shall go into
effect immediately upon its approval
by the governor."
It will be recalled that Governor
Manning in his annual message asked
for "adequate provision for the pay of
special deputies whenever and wherever
needed" to enforce the prohibition
law.
Free Tuition.
...
Both houses are rapidly getting
down to steady -work. Uhe matter of
free tuition in the state colleges, and
the abuse of the scholarships by those
able to pay tuition, came in for considerable
discussion in both the house
I
and senate on Wednesday. Some of
the members want to abolish free tuition
altogether, while other contend
t*hat these scholarships can be properly
safeguarded so that only those en
titled to them by reason of lack of
means to pay tuition can receive the
benefits. The statement was freely
made in the discussion on Wednesday
that men worth thousands of dollars
were swearing they were unable to
pay tuition fees. Some action looking
towards providing a remedy for this
glaring evil will probably be taken at
this session, as it should be.
17 Bills by One Member,
j Seventeen bills were introduced iD
the house on the opening day of the
session by one member?Mr. S. M.
Wolfe of Anderson?and eight were

'He that is not on speaking terms
with his neighbor is not within speaking
distance of-heaven.?Ex.
Now, that sounds to me like pretty
good sense. I have known some people
who would stop speaking to people,
they didn't like?or I reckon they didn't
like. It always did seem to me to
I K/-. i nr-Attir nnnr- nrov tr? TVliniiGVi Ano
ur Cl t l/Lj " WJ lU Jk/Uiiiuu VJUV
by not speaking to him, and, yet, I,
have heard of people who would pass
right along by other people and not
speak. A fellow who won't speak to
!Ms neighbor must feel mighty bad all
the time . And I must believe that this
Ex. is true when he says that these
same fellows, who won't speak to you
as they pass, are not within speaking
distance of heaven. Though I have
known some who stand mighty high
in the sanctuaries of men and the
church militant. But toow about the
church triumphant? There is a whole
lot of difference, or that is the conclusion
I have reached after hearing
the preachers explain this-' subject. But
I .am going to talk about something
else.
Now, I am going to ask permission
to preach another little sermon by
just quoting a thought that I read the
other day, and the subject of the quotation
is "A Thought." Read it, young
man, and then read it again, and then
think about it. I hope you will follow
the voice that is calling you to
"the slowly rising sun of human brotfherhood,"
"where are heard the glad
shouts of humanity and where 'honest
effort is rewarded with immortality."
A Thought.
Young man, life is before you.
Two voices are caning you?one
coming from the swamps of selfishness
and force, where success means
death, and the other from the hilltops
cf justice and progress, where even
failure brings glory. Two lights are
seen in your hbrizon?one the fastfading
marsh light of power and the
other the slowly rising sun of human
brotherhood. Two ways lie before you
--one leading to an ever lower and
lower plane, where are heard the cries
of despair and the curses of the poor,
where manhood shrivels and possession
rots down the possessor; and the
other leading off to the highlands of
the morning, where are heard the glad
shouts of humanity and where honest
effort is rewarded with immortality.?
John Peter Altgeld.
j And this reminds me of a resolution j
that Buster Brown resolved after he
h&d entertained two fair visitors at
his home by making Tige do tricks, that
j somehow were not altogether agreeable
and pleasant to the fair visitors
at his home. He thought they were
funny?the tricks?no doubt, but they
?the fair visitors?did not enjoy them
and left m disgust, anu. mm. mu>&u
Buster to resolve, and here is what he
resolved:
"Resolved, That there are some funny
people in the world. The idea of
those ladies not enjoying the tricks.
But they must think I am funny, too.
! Well, we are all more or less funny

For Six Per Cent Interest.
Already a bill has been introduced
to make the legal rate of interest six
per cent. This measure has been urged I
I in previous legislatures for some
years. It has a- better chance of passage
this year than ever before, but
if it meets defeat at this session it is
only a question of sJ short time when
it will become a law.
The senate discussed at some length
on Wednesday Senator Carlisle's resolution
to submit to the people a constitutional
amendment to permit "women
to hold the positions of notary
public and school trustee. Senator
Wightman of Saluda was afraid it was
a step in the direction of woman suffrage.
This was "vigorously disclaimed
by the advocates of the measure. The
resolution will come up for further
debate today.
Endorse Wilson Administration.
The legislature has endorsed the
Wilson administration and put itself on
record as favoring the re-nomination
of President Wilson,

good in the bad people and so much

should never dare to criticise each,

would do in the other fellow's place.
"Judge not that ye be not judged'*

I feel like saying, "0, well," sometimes,
too, just like Buster said, and
yet there are some good people who
feel like they are privileged to criticise
you, but if you dare to criticize
them they hold up their bands and
say, "Suppose you try the job, if you
know so much about it." Well, I
reckon it is best to mind your own.

be frank, I am going to say what I
think just as I think it, and I am going
to try to think honestly and right,
and if it doesn't suit other people, and
they think I am trying to attend to
their business, why they can just think
so, so far as I am concerned, and I
don't care a snap of my finger about
it. I have no favors to asfc, and am
in no position to grant any, but I am
going on saying what I think so long
as the editor will print it, and I want
to say that it is always said in the
very best of good will and with no
intention to do injury or hurt to any
one, but to help the Whole. . ^,
I said in my last that I was going
to talk about some things that I #
thought should be done in this town*

I and if they don't like what I say, why

mention a good many things that have

result of what I tiave written, tout
| you couldn't get any of the good peoI
pie to admit it, but I know it, and I
don't care whether they admit it or
give me credit for it or not. I know
when I am carried over to Rosemont
and laid quietly to jest, that they will
say he did a good work for this town,
and that will .be satisfaction enough.
I am not expecting anything in thia
world execept a bare existence and sufficient
to keep me alive while I am .
permitted to exist, and all they say \
about me will do me no hurt.

Some one told me the other day that
a good lady who was walking along
the streets fell over a fence tnat wa3?
but had decided no longer to be, and
had laid quietly down on fhe sidewalk,
and she came very near being badly
hurt. Fortunately she was not injured.
This is mentioned only to call
to the attention of the property owners
of this town that it would be well to
look a little more carefully after the
condition of their holdings and keep
their fences from trespassing upon the
property of the town and getting in
the pathway of the ladies. Look out
for my next. I am going to take a
whole night in which to write it, and
