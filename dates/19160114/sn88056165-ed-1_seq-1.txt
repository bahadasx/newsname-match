Christian Lange Called Beyond
Christian Lange, who was re
ported quite ill last week, passed
away at nine o'clock Saturday
morning from pronchial pneu
monia, from which he had been
suffering only a few days. At
the last he refused nurishment
and medicine and it was impos
sible to stay the ravages of his
illness.
The deceased was born in Ger
many and came to this country
in early manhood. He was mar
ried near Chicago and lived there
for several years, later removing
to Iowa where he resided until
in March, 1906, when he moved
to Idaho and settled on a farm
south of this place. Two years
later he sold the farm and moved
into town and has resided here
continuously since that time.
Five children were born to Mn
and Mrs. Lange, two of whom
died in infancy. The deceased
is survived by a widow, one
daughter and two sons. He was
71 years, 10 months and 8 days
old at the time of his death.
Mr. Lange was an industrious,
frugal citizen, a kind and loving
husband and father and a thor
ough Christian. He was a mem
ber of the Luthern church and
lived up strictly to the teachings
of his faith during his entire
lifetime. He made a large mum
ber of friends since coming to
Idaho, all of whom sincerely
mourn his death.
The funeral was held from the
residence Monday afternoon,
Rev. Probst, of Gifford, preach
ing the sermon, and the remains
were laid to rest in the local
cemetery, a large number of
family friends attending the last
rites despite the inclemency of
the weather.
The Chronicle joins with the
many friends in extending sin
cere sympathy to them in their
bereavement.
We desire to extend deepest
thanks to the friends and nigh
bors who rendered us aid during
the last illness and death of our
dear husband and father and to
assure them that the kindness
will be long remembered.
Mrs. C. Lange,
Miss Minnie Lange,
Mr. and Mrs. F. C. Lange,
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Lange.
Chester Thompson returned
last night from a visit to his old
home io Roseburg, Ore.
Making a Little Farm Pay
In the last issue of the Orofino
Tribune is published a state
ment from Mrs. M. L. George,
who conducts a small farm in the
Fraser neighborhood, largely de
voted to dairying. This state
ment is illuminative of what can
be done with small investment
anywhere in central Idaho, and
probably is being done in many
unsuspected places. Mrs. George
in her letter under date of Jan.
1, 1916, writes:
"While closing our little farm
account for the past year it oc
curred to me that you might
like to have a little statement of
interest to your readers from a
Clearwater county farmer.
"Our income from five cows
and three two-year-old heifers
has been as follows for the past
year:
Butter sold........1509 pounds $511.95
Home consumption 104 pounds 34.66
Total .............1613 pounds
Calves.........................$200.00
Buttermilk.........150 gal. 15.00
$761.61
"None of these cows are pure
bred stock, but some are part
Jersey.
"Each cow has averaged an
income of $95.20, the price of a
good cow.
"Average per month, $63.47.
"Forty-three head of hogs
were sold off of the stubble and
were fed on a part of the sepa
rated milk. They brought $258."
Don't Be Over Critical
It is mighty easy to form the
critical habit, and it is a habit
that has practically nothing to
recommend it. No one can find
everything in the world to their
liking, and the great thing is to
accept the world as you find it.
Life is spoiled by constant
carping and criticising, and to be
surrounded with an atmosphere
of fault-finding is as depressive
as a fog. No one on earth en
joys being told that he is in the
wrong all the time. He may be
lieve it, but he would rather
think that you didn't.
When you feel a disposition to
criticise, just remember that you
were not born to set the world
right. Say to yourself, 'after
all, it is of no consequence,' and
keep the critical faculty for your
own use; it will have all the ex
ercise it needs.
Cougar and Lynx Numerous
Several lynx have been killed
in this vicinity recently. Walter
Snyder killed one a few days ago
that measured six feet, while
Omer Snyder brought in one
shortly afterwards that was not
quite as long. Their hides are
valuable for furs and rugs and
there is a bounty of $2.50 on
each animal.
Walter and Doc Bonner, who
live over on Orofino creek, re
port that they recently killed
four big cougar in their neigh
borhood in one day. This is a
record for one day for cougar
hunting. The bounties amount
ed to $100 and the hides are
worth from $15 to $25 each. —

SHOULD BE SILOS
ON EVERY FARM
Orofino Paper Tells Why the
Farmers Should Produce
Cheap Feed—The Silo is a
Logical Solution.
George Cook, residing on the
Fohl place two miles up Orofino
creek from Orofino, says that the
more his stock eat ensilage the
better they like it, and he is
more than satisfied with the re
sult of his experiment. Mr.
Cook says his hens have laid all
winter, and credits this to the
fact that the chickens are very
fond of the ensilage, which they
pick up, watching for]'any that
is scattered by the cattle. The
green feed seems to be just what
the hens need. It is certain
many silos will go up throughout
this section the coming year,
since those who have tried them
can't say enough for]"them. In
this connection let "the!.'reader
stop and figure on the element of
cost in the production of a pound
of pork or beef, and it will not
take a wise man to see at a
glance that the profit depends
entirely on the cost of produc
tion; that there is profit in hogs
at five tents if the cost of pro
duction is two or three or four
cents. But if high cost of feed
brings the cost of producing a
pound of pork up to six cents,
there isn't much profit if the
farmer sells at five. The cheap
er the feed the greater the profit,
so the farmer must wake up and
play the game. If a silo will
solve thelproblem, or if corn and
alfalfa is thelcrop, find out and
get busy.
If success lays in combining
cattle, hogs and hens, feeding
the crops on the farm, do it. If
dairying is necessary to the suc
cess of our farmers do that, be
cause the test of any crop or any
system is the profit it will re
turn for honest effort and the
money invested. —Clearwater Re

Some Treats Are Coming
During January and February
the local public is destined to see
some of the highest class motion
picture attractions ever shown
on top of the hill. This was
made possible when the manage
ment of the local play house
closed a contract with the Fox
Film Corporation for several of
its best feature films. The first
of these features will be shown
at the Orpheum next Sunday,
January 16th, when that well
known story of St. Elmo, known
to almost everyone of our read
ers, will be depicted in motion
pictures. St. Elmo is a great
story and the dramatization of it
has improved on the original
story. More than a hundred
thousand dollars was spent in
producing this great play for the
motion picture company and our
readers will miss something real
ly worth while if they fail to see
St. Elmo next Sunday.
The features booked for future
dates are as follows: Jan. 30,
Princess Romanoff; Feb. 13, The
Nigger; Feb. 27, A Woman's
Resurrection.
Because of the high cost of
these productions and the addi
tional cost of securing same an
admission price of 15c and 25c
will be charged for each produc
tion. Mark down the dates for
future reference and do not miss
a single one of these g e a 11 y
superb attractions.

Stock Market Report.
Following is a report of the
stock market at Portland for the
week of Jan. 12:
In the face of a large run of
1350 head, the market began on
an upward trend and choice
grain fed steers sold at $7.90.
Hay fed sold a dime over last
week, making the top $7.60.
One feature of the market was
that the bulk of the stuff was
the best seen for some time.
Cows are going at good strong
prices, with all other lines in
proportion.
A good feeling with excellent
quality and the market a nickel
higher than the closing of last
week's market, bringing the top
to the $6.90 mark, is a very good
way to express the situation at
the North Portland yards. Bulk
of swine went ot $6.85. North
Portland is but a nickel under
the Chicago market today.
A good run of sheep came for
ward over Sunday and lambs
sold at $8.25. Ewes sold at $6.50
with all lines steady to stronger.
