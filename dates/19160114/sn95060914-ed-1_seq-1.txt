foreign mining men all save one
of them Americans were ruthlessly
murdered by a band of Villa sol
diers under the command of Col
onel Lopez
Dragged from the train on which
they were en route to resume oper
ations of the property of the Cusi
huiriachic Mining Company in west-
ern Chihuahua their passports and
salvo conductos furnished by the
Carrnnza authorities at Juarez and
Chihuahua scoffed at the men were4
stripped of their clothing clubbed
bayonetted and otherwise Ill-treated
and the luckless eighteen ruth
lessly shot down by the side of the
tracks The train on which they
traveled and on which were a large
number of Mexican passengers was
allowed to proceed to its destination
The bodies of the eighteen victims
were recovered by an armed party
of Carranza soldiers and Americans
from Chihuahua and were brought
to El Paso Texas yesterday morn
ing where the corpses were unload
ed and taken to various undertaking
establishments
Accompanying the bodies were
eight armed Americans of a group
that had gone out from Chihuahua
City to recover them
A military train bearing troops
from Chihuahua followed thedeath
special
Americans who came to El Paso
from Chihuahua with the death
special related in voices tense
with emotion the scenes that took
place when the wholesale massacre
occurred They had gotten the
story from Mexican and Italian
passengers on the Mexican North
western train which carried the un
fortunate Americans to their death
According to these passengers
who arrived in Chihuahua City at
900 oclock Monday night with the
story of the murders the train was
stopped at 115 oclock Monday
afternoon at kilometer 68 a short
distance west of Santa Ysabel A
derailed supply train on the track
ahead caused the passenger train to
halt
As soon as it had come to a stop
thirty or forty armed Mexicans
sprang toward it from gullies and
hills nearby while in the distance on
a crest of hills appeared several hun
dred mounted men All were Vil
listas The Mexicans boarded the
train and ordered the gringos to
stand up So suddenly and unex
pectedly had they appeared that
the whole crowd of passengers was
dazed As the bandits pushed
through the aisle of the car seeking
Americans they began to draw their
revolvers and curse Several of the
Americans rose in their seats when
the banditB appeared One of them
called out laughingly Well were
robbed again
Suddenly a shot rang out and W
D Pearce fell backward in his seat
with n bullet in his body ISy this
time the bandits had grasped sev
eral of the Americans who made
no resistance According to the
Mexicans who witnessed the scene
all the men seemed to take it as a
lark especially when one of the
Mexicans commanded them to take
off their clothes With the shoot
ing of Pearce though the real na
ture of the bandits intention be
came apparent and the little group
of Americans some of whom by
this time were standing outside near
the train under guard became ser
ious Still no resistance was offered
A few seconds after Pearce fell
there was a volley of shots inside
the car and three or four more of
the party fell W J Wallace who
was walking down the car steps
ahead of two pandits was shot in
the head from behind and toppled
to the ground As each American
fell the murderers set upon them
like wolves and tore the clothing
from their bodies stripping them
almost naked

W W Pace added some fine
comedy by his Slams on the Digni

that slamming was not his usual

married ladies were led on the floor
as the favorites as even the boys

their mothers a good time

to the merits of the attraction that
I have never had a company of any
kind which proved to be such a
drawing card as was this organiza
tion
In six days we entertained over
seven thousand people and this in
competition with four other theatres
and a carnival company And more
than being a drawing power I have
had more congratulations on the
program during the time this
splendid company appeared at my
theatre than for any other attraction
I have ever had
I played the company for one full
engagement and then re engaged
them for a second and a third en
gagement of equal length to the
first and on each night we have en
joyed increasing patronage
An excellent company of artists
real Hawaiians willing at all times
well behaved they are gentlemen in

command the dignity and attention
which they deserve L R Love

The following telegram wos re
ceived by The Guahdian dated
Phoenix January 12 1916
It is openly talked here among
the democrats that Hon George A
Olney will permit the use of his
name as a democratic candidate for
for governor While Mr Olney has
neither admitted nor denied the
truth of this rumor it is generally
believed to be true
With a man like Olney heading
the ticket the democrats feel sure
of victory as it is- pointed out that
all factions will unite on him and
put the democratic ticket through
to victory with hbiggest majority

safe keeping
Salazar has a very bad reputation
and there seems to be very little
doubt but that he participated in
the murders as the leader Under
present conditions the sheriff be
lieved it would be safer to confine
Salazar in the Globe jail until his
trial comes up in the Superior Court
The Mexicans arrested by the of
ficers at Salazars house on the
night the murders were committeed
have been released from custody
and they have departed for Morenci
Under Sheriff Bennett returped
Saturday from New Mexico where
he went in search of the three al
leged murderers who were seen in
Lordsburg N M the early part of
last week and who were said to
have left that place for Silver City
Officer Bennett failed to pick up
the trail as the Mexicans had too
great a Btart owing to the fact that
the information giving the identity
of the alleged murderers and their
whereabouts came to the officers
too late
The alleged murderers are still at
large and maybe have crossed the
line into Mexico They are known
however and the chances are fav
orable that they will be captured
and tried for their brutal crime

OFFICERS CAPTURE THE BOOZE
Men Are Held for Trial in the
Superior Court Under
50000 Bonds
Lester Eller and Fred Elkins two
Miami men were arrested Sunday
night by Under Sheriff Bennett and
Marshal Lancaster on the highway
about seven miles east of Solomon
ville and brought to Solomonville
and locked up in the jail on a charge
of bootlegging
The men were brought here Mon
day for examination before Justice
of the Peace Paxton who held them
under 500 bond each to answer to
the Superior Court
The officers received word Sun
day that an automobile was stalled
out on the road east of Solomonville
and that it was a bootlegging outfit
It seems that the machine broke
down and the men had to come here
for repair parts
Before leaving the machine they
cached ten cases of whiskey Dur
ng their absence a traveler got
text to the cache and departed with
vWo cases of the booze
The men returned to the machine
and made the necessary repairs
then secured the remaining cases of
booze and started for Safford but
were met on the road by the officers
who placed them under arrest and
seized the whiskey
The tight cases contained 192
pint bottles of Hill Hills whiskey
The booze was brought here and
labeled evidence and later was
taken to Solomonville where it was
locked up in the steel cage for safe
keeping
Both Eller and Elkins are still in
jail waiting for an angel to come
along and bail them out
