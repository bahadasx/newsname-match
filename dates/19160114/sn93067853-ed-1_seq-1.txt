Americans, were killed by Mexican
bandits yesterday after being taken
from a Mexico Northwestern train 50 C(
miles west of Chihuahua City, robbed
and stripped of their clothing, according:
to a message received here to- g
night by H. C. Myles, British vice
consul here, from British Consul
Scovell at Chihuahua City.
Cnofirmation of the news of the
tragedy tonight was given by officials ej
here of the Carranza government.
According to the de facto government's
announcement given to representatives
here of several mining vj
companies the following 16 were re- h<
ported killed: C. R. Watson, William cj
J. Wallace, E. L. Robinson, George hi

were travelling from Chihuahua City w
. ' # to -Cusitiuiriaphlc, Chihuahua, c&rried ni

a large quantity* of supplies sent by tl
the ^rtepiWi Spielting and R&fining .ei

* It is believed "here that aft the IF"
Aiiicncaii mining men Known co nave M
been in Chihuahjua City were on boaid B
the looted train.
Thomas M. Holmes, the only known
survivor, stated, however, in his brief
telegram giving the first news of the
raid that he counted but 10 An.ericans
taken from the train.
It is supposed the bandits belongel j*
to the forces of Gen. Jose Rodriquez,
a Villa supporter, known to be op
erating in Chihuahua against the Ue . 1
facto government of Mexico. ln
Almost immediately after the first a,r
news was received a censorship was .
imposed on the wires between Juarez
and Chihuahua City by the Carranza al
officials. This action was taken, it
was said, "until the story could bo j
verified from official Mexican sources.': ' '
According to the brief messages re- '
ceived here, the train bearing the _
Americans was stopped by the bandits
about 50 miles west of Chihuahua
City. The mining men were taken
from the train, robbed, stripped naked
and lined up along the cars for exe
cution. Holmes was said to have been ^
om the extreme end of the line and as ^
the firing squad took position, he nj
broke away and fled into the desert.
With feet and body cut and bleeding Qi
from stones and sharp cactus, he ran ^
until he no longer heard the whistle '
of bullets pass him. He succeeded in
reaching friendly Mexicans, it is re- p|
ported, and was aided to return to sj
Chihuahua City. pj
The First News.
The first news of the bandit raid
was received here through a telegram
from Holmes to officials of the
smelting company asking them to
notify his wife that he had reached .
Chihuahua City. lo
His message aroused anxiety concerning
the fate of the other men
known to have left Chihuahua City tc
for Cusihuarlachic, and before the |8
censorship was imposed they succeed- w
ed in getting into communication with jQ
mining men in Chihuahua City who j j
furnished the brief details of the at- tl
tack. n)
The Americans, it was said, had hs- e
suranees of protection given the ^
smelting company by the Carranza w
government through the United States o)
state department. tj

Smith Points to Importance of i
South Carolina Senatoi
in South Atli
Washington, Jan. 11.?Senator
Smith of South Carolina today introduced
in the senate q resolution,
which was adopted, calling upon the
secretary of agriculture to gather
data and submit it to the senate relative
to the fertilizer situation, particularly
with reference to potash. . 1
Senator Smith yesterday sent to i
the commissioners of agricultro*.
throughout the South the following j
inquiry: > \
"What in vour oninion will .
effect on the yield of cotton per acre
in your State if the present fertilizer
situation is not improved, especially
as to potash?"
From each he received replies to
the effect that the reduction in yield
per acre would be anywhere from 5
to 50 per cent.
In discussing the purport of the
resolution, Senator Smith said:
"The prospects for Another year,
especially as to cot?>n, are that
nothing like a normal yield, possibly
a 30 pr 40 per cent reduction, will
be the result if the present fertilizer
situation 'is not relieved. Germa-iy
has a monopoly of the production if
potash; Chile a practical monopoly
of the concentrated nitrates. On account
of the war situation it will be
impracticable to obtain potash from

ERS
CK FERTILIZER
Need?Means Smaller Yield?
r Sees Crave Prospect
mtic States.
Germany. The prices of the nitrates,
presumably on account of the increased
demand for these ingredients
in war munitions, have risen to where
they are totally impracticable for fertilizer
purposes. Phosphoric acid,
for some reason, has also risen in
il : 12? * -
i ncac iiucc increments, viz.,
nitrate of ammonia, phosphoric acid
and potash are absolutely essential in
the production of cotton in all of the
South Atlantic States where cotton ,is
produced, particularly in all of the
coastal plains of North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and
eastern Alabama.
"If anything like an average yield
is to be had it must necessarily be at
an enormous increase of acreage and
an enormous increase of cotton acreage
would mean a decrease of grain,
forage and the foodstuffs crops. An
increase in cotton acreage without
proper fertilization means an almost
prohibitive increase in the expense of
producing this crop. The cost of cultivation,
including labor and live
stock, would make this cost so high
that even at the present prices there
could be no profit.
"Therefore, from the present outlook
for fertilizers, the prospect for
the yield of cotton next year is the
poorest that has confronted the
Sout hsince the War of Secession."
SAYS PROHIBITION

Mr. B. C. Smith, who has recently

"They may say prohibition does not
prohibit, but I can testify that it does
prohibit in Winston-Salam, N. C.,
where I have recently spent some
time. I bear testimjny to the fact
th$t prohibition doc-s prohibit in that,

CITY AUTHORI
WILL
THE BURNING OF COLUMBIA.
An Unintentional Confession by One
of Sherman's Bummers.
The Columbus, Ga., Sun and Times
published the following: letter, which
was found in the streets of Columbia
immediately after the army of Gen.
Sherman had left. And the original
of which has been preserved and can
be shown and substantiated.
Camp Near Camden. S. C.
Feb. 27, 18(55.
My dear Wife:
I have no time for particulars, we
have had a glorious time in this State,
unrestricted license to burn and plunder
was the order of the day. The
chivalry of the State have been
stripped of most of their valuables?
gold watches, silver, pitchers, cups,
spoons, forks, etc., are as common in
camp as blackberries. The terms of
plunder are as follows: The valuables
procured are estimated by companies;
each company is required to exhibit
the results of its operations at any
given place. One-fifth and first choice
falls to the share of commander-inchief
and staff?one-fifth to the corps
commander and staff, one-fifth to field
officers of regiments and two-fifths to
the company. Officers are not allowed
to join these expeditions without disguising
themselves as privates. One
of our corps commanders borrowed a
suit of rough clothes from one of my
men and was successful in this place.
He get a large quantity of silver
among other things an old time milk
pitcher and a very fine gold watch
from a Mr. De Saussure of this place.
DeSaussure is one of the F. F. V.'s of
S. C. and was made to fork over liberally.
Officers over the rank of captain
are not made to put their plunder
in the estimate for general distribution.
This is very unfair and for that
reason and in order to protect themselves,
subordinate officers and privates
keep back everything that they
can carry ahout their person, such as
rings, ear rings, bieast pins, etc., of
which, if I ever live to get home, I
leave about a quart. I am not joking;
behave at least a quart of jewelry for
|>6u'?nd till The g^rls and some "NTo.'l
diamond rings and pins among them, j
Gen. Sherman has silver and gold
enough to start a hank. His share in
gold watches and chains alone at Columbia
was 275.
But I said 1 could not go into particulars.
All the general officers and
many besides had valuables of every
description down to embroidered la
dies' pocket handkerchiefs?I have my
share of them, too. We took gold and
silver enough from the d rebels
to have redeemed their infernal currency
twice over. This( the currency)
whenever we come across it we burn
as it considered it utterly worthless.
I wish all the jewelry this army has
could be carried to the Old Bay State.
It would deck her out in glorious
style but, alas, it will be scattered all
over the northern Middle States. The
d niggers as a general rule prefer
to stay at home, particularly after
they found out that we only wanted
the able bodied men and to tell you
the truth, the youngest and best-looking
women. Sometimes we took off
whole families and plantations of niggers,
by way of paying secessionists.
But the useless part of them we soon
managed to lose, sometimes in crossing
rivers and sometimes by other
ways.
I shall write you again from Wilmington,
Goldboro or some other
place in North Carolina. The order
to march has arrived and I must close
hurriedly. Love to Grandmother,
Aunt Carlotte. Take care of vonrcelf
and the children. Don't show this
letter out of the family.
Your affectionate husband,
Thomas J. Myers. Lieut., etc.
P. S.?I will send this by the first
flag of truce to be mailed unless I
have an opportunity of sending it to
Hilton Head. Tell Sallie 1 am saving
a pearl bracelet and ear rings for her.
but Lambert got the breast pin and
rings of the same set. I am trying
to trade him out of them. These
were taken from Mfs. Jamison, daughter
of the President of the S. C. Secession
convention. We found these
on our trip through Georgia.

This letter was addressed to Mrs'
Thomas J. Myers, Boston, Mass.

ENFORCE LAW
Blind Tigers Will Have
Rough Handling?Mayor
Wharton,* City Council
and Chief of Police Evans
Have Determined to Enforce
Laws Against Illicit
Selling of Whiskey.
The city authorities have bejrun a
determined effort to enforce the law
against the illicit sale of liquor in
Union. Mayor Wharton, Chief of Police
Milo H. Evans and the aldermen
of the city have made it plain that
I they are tfoinjr to enforce the law.
A recent ordinance, looking to the
suppression of blind timers, was
jium.-scu, ana is now operative. Notice
of the determination of the authorities
to enforce the law has been served
upon the public, and it will po hard
with the violators of the law.
The first liquor case before Mayor
Wharton since the cominp of prohibition
was that of "Bill" Wfllard. He
was tried by a jury and found puilty
with recommendation to the mercy of
the court. In view of the recommendation
to mercy, Mayor Wharton
sentenced the defendant to pay a fine
of $50 or serve fifteen days upon the
public works of the city. Mayor
Wharton says his invariable rule will
be "$100 or .'10 days," except in cases
where the trial is by jury and the
recommendation to mercy is made.
Chief of Police Milo H. Evans says he
has instructed his men to make arrests
of all cases where it is known
that the law is beinp violated. He
says he intends to strictly enforce the
law, regardless of whom it may offend.
The authorities are receiving
the commendation of every pood citizen
in this effort to enforce the law.
Everywhere the sentiment for the
law's enforcement is growing. The
many have come to realize that it is
not ripht that a dozen or less men
should be allowed to break down the
law.
