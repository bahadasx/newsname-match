on Slippery Streets
Yesterdpy and today saw scenes
along Chickasha's streets which tended
to prove this one of the least snobbish
end most democratic cities in the
southwest. Bank presidents and ordi

down the middler .the irtreta and al
most unanimously tendered the use of
the sidewalks to teams and autos. No

it is that once in awhUo come mis

cared not to associate with the com

truth of the Bible's statement that
"pride goe.th before a fall, ' was borne
out and witnessed with gieat amuse

to the aristocrats.
It was not an uncommon sight at any

VIENNA, Jan. 14. It was officially
announced today that Austrian troops
had occupied Cettinje, the capital of
Montenegro.
By United Press.
ROME, Jan. 14. Austrian artillery
was trained on Cettinje and the gun
ners were awaiting the signal to lay
the Montenegrin capital in ruins when
King Nicholas signed the armistice
which virtually eliminated the littl'5
country from the war.
Tba aged ruler is reported to have
wept as he agreed to the truce. He
told his military commanders that he
was willing to take to the mountains
and fight the AuEtrians to the end,
but they persuaded him that the con
tinuation of the struggle without out
side aid would mean greater misery
for his people than the Serbians and
Belgians suffered.
The formal negotiations for the sur
render of the half-starved Montene
grin army will begin immediately, it
is expected. It is believed that the
Montenegrins will be the first of the
allies to haul down their colors be
fore the Austro-Germans and that ten
tative peace terms will be arranged
with them before the end of the month.
BENEFICIAL
TO WHEAT
County Farm Agent O. C. Cooper
stated this morning that the present
snow would prove of almost inestim

Mr. Cooper stated that a very small
acreage of the wheat of Grady county
may have been injured by the dry
weather, but that yie crop would, he
thought, show up with at least an
average yield unless something unfor
seen happens between this time and
the date of harvesting.
b; F. Parker, agricultural agent
from Hobart, Kiowa county, stopped
over today en route to Oklahoma City,
as the guest of Agent Cooper of CJrady
county. Mr. Parker states that in his
opinion things were never in better
shape, from an agricultural viewpoint,
in this section of Oklahoma. He looks
for bumper crops during the coming
year.

U. P. Man Joins Party of Correspondents
Bound for Anglo-French Front
in Serbia as Fall-Back to
Saloniki is Started
TAKES PASSAGE ON
LARGE AUTO TRUCK
Gives Vivid Glimpses of Scenes in War
Torn Region; Bleak Landscape With
Patches of Snow; Frozen
Soldier is Found
(By William G. Shepherd, United Press
Staff Corespondent.)
SALONIKI, Dec. 13. (By Mail.)-'
Two huge baskets, filled with wicker-
cover-d hot ilea of ChiantI wine, from
among which peeped the white necks
of champagne bottles, made up our
supply of traveling provisions when,
our party of correspondents set out
for the Anglo-French front in Serbia.
True, indeed, there was a small pack-
age for each man boiled eggs, cold
beef with tiny paper packets of salt
and pepper but these were sa small
we were able to carry them in our
pockets.
This was an Italian scheme of pro.
visions. We had left to two Italian
journalists a newspaper man In Italy
is always a journalist the task of
purchasing our food supply. We didn't
know, as we pulled out of the station
on a rattly military train, that we were
going forward to witness the begin
ning of an ally retreat. Before us was
Krivolak, where1 the French had fougut
so long and bo hard with their "seventy-fives,"
and General Sarrail had told
ns that we should see Krivolak and
the fighting there.
At the British Front
Before us was the British front, made
up of veterans who had gone through,
the hell's fire of the Dardanelles. Be
fore us were all the thrilling things to
see that the war affords.
We got out of the train at a little)
railroad station on the shore of Lalca
Dorian and found ourselves in the
midst of British troops. I've used the
name of the lake, though before we
started out we were told that we must
net mention the names of places in our
stories. But nine days have changed
all that. The Bulgarians have all these
places now. It is no secret.
An English captain met us.
"Have you automobiles for thesa
correspondents?" asked our French
lieutenant guide.
"Not a "one," said the British cap
tain, "unless they wait to ride on t.hi3
load of hay." He pointed to a big auto
truck half loaded with bales of Britioli
hay. Into the truck wc piled with hal
a dozen English Tommies giving uJ
lifts. Just as. we started off ' they
cried, "Marble Arch, Holburn Circus,
Bank, Elephant and Castle."
It was a cockney's way of saying,
"Houston street only," or "West Farm
express." 4
, No Sign of Retreat.
We hadn't seen a sign of retreat.
The British captain got onto a fine
horse and rode along beside us. The
road skirted the lake a circle of water
three miles across and scores of odd
ly dressed Greeks and Serbians peas
ants got out of our way as we rolled
along tlirough mud, hugging our oblon?
seats of hay. Everywhere were British
plodilin through the mud, riding
heavy ii night horses, sitting by road-
side fires.
"Great fish in this lake," said the
British captain, riding up behind tho
motor truck. "Perch, country round
here famous for them. Having some for
dinner louight in my mess."
"These duck3 ought to be good,"
said one of our party pointing to the
reeds where thousands of birds floated.
"Not ducks," he said. "Some sort o!
blackbird. Don't know whether they're
good or not. Going to try some of them
in our mess tonight, too." i
"Good horse you've got theve."
"Polo pony. Splendid. Old stand-by,
Been at Ranelagh many aime."
Raulaugh! And this wold Creek lakfl.
It would be like taking a Piping Rock
horse to Vera Crux.
"Where's Hay Going?"
Still not a sign of retreat that wO
knew nothing about.
"Where Is this hay going?" some om
