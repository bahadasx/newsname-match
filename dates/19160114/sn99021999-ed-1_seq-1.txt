After the coldest night that has

FAIL TOJNTHUSE
Dr. Rouse's Plan to Put New Life
Into Church After Sunday Re
vival Falls Flat.
ASM&iAfil rABiUtt AL3U UUllo
Complete collapse of Rev. Freder
ick T. Rouse's plans to boom the
First Congregational church along
the lines laid down by "Billy" Sun
day in his recent Omaha campaign is
Marked by Rev. Dr. Rouse's resigna
tion. Dr. Rouse was a vigorous sup
porter .of the Sunday evangel and a
member of the executive committee
iu charge of the campaign. Follow
ing the departure . of the Sunday
party Mr. Rouse tried to Infuse new
life into his congregation by using
sunaayesque meiuoas. Jiy name
has been Rouse;
henceforth it shall
v, .i'.,
be von Ilindenburg," he declared
The trail hitters were gathered In. At
the reception each trail hitter stood
l il a atilnfr V. n (i rlth n nrAL'inni mamhai.
,and thu( u w d th frl,owsh,p hao
,been cemented.
Th( church crowded for tw0 gun-
1 days. Then came the reaction. The ex
citement died down. The congregation
dwindled and It has Continued to dwin
dle in spite of militant evangelistic meth
ods, in spite of an assistant pastor, in
sptte of neighborhood canvasses, in spite
of new organizations for prosecuting the
congregation's activities.
Work All In Vain.
Immediately after the Sunday campaign 1
he rfty wgg by church Jnt) ,
;ril.trl. t- . lira, r.Hln rmmH th.
j church and these districts were canvassed i
by-some of the workers. Handbills were
distributed urging the people to come to
church. All in vafn.
There has been opposition to Dr. Rouse
on the part of some of the church's
members for a long time. Even from the
time that he was called, eight years
ago, It waa admitted that he wasn't ab -
solutely orthodox. And his attitude to-1
ward dancing and card playing haa al -
ways been friendly.- -
The First Congregational church Is ad-
mittedly a hard field because of the fact (
Its membership is scattered. Less than 1
i 13 per cent live within walking distance
! of the cnurch at Nineteenth and Davcn- '
. port streets. Many members nave joined
the general exodus in recent years to t lc '
wewtern part of the city. This Is largely I
responsible for the poor attendance. Many
on the church rolls have lost interest be
cause of their distance from the church
and , have ceaeed to attend or to con
tribute. TJie assistant pastor. P. B. Cleveland,
has alno resigned. He had been em
ployed only about six months and was
puid by the 'non'a class of the church.
His contract expne: January 21. so that
Ins resignation merely marks the close of
his contract.
The possibility of this church and the
St. Mary's Avenue Congregational church
uniting and building a fine church in the
western part of the city Is a very likely
development. Vhis would be merely fol
lowing the example of other congrega
tions, such as the Fir.t Presbyterian and
Kountzc Menior.al Lutheran.
A chun h edifice locate! nearer the ra -dences
of the members would be sure to
cumulate the attendance.

WHISPER ARGUMENTS TO JUDGE '
Prosecution Completes Its Evidence
Identifying Hauser as ,
Murderer.
TESTIMONY FOR DEFENSE TODAY I
Judge James P. English, presiding
at the trial of Arthur Hauser in dis
trict court, ruled late yesterday that
no evidence of alleged crimes other
than the murder of W. II. Smith,
with which the dandlt is charged.
i was admissible and the case of the
i prosecution came to an abrupt close.
The prosecution rested at. 3:50
j o'clock Immediately after Steve
jMaloney, captain of detectives, had
jtold of bringing the defendant from
Wichita, an.
i KAttorneys for the defense de-
were
ready to testify because they had
not expected the state to rest so
soon and their request for a recess
until 9:30 this morning was granted
by the court.
A revolver with which, the state
alleged, Hauser killed Mr. Smith
was offered In evidence, but was
ruled out.
County Attorney Magney offered to in
troduce evidence of a -erip of crimes
similar in plot and execurton to the
""'""P anu inuiaer ror ine pur -
pose of assisting In Identifying Hauser
as the slayer of the late Woodmen of the
World cashier. Counsel for Hauser ob -

The lawyers and the Judge carried on
brief conversation concerning the sub
ject in w'. lspers In order that the Jurors
mlfa'ht not hear. The county attorney of
fered to cite decisions o. courts uphold
ing admission of evidence of series of
similar crimes for purposes of UlVntlfi-1
cation In criminal trials, and the defense I
wa ready to cite contrary rulings Judge!
Knglish declined to hear arguments and
ruled out the evidence.
j of otllpr cHlnM may not he lntroduceil

I UP this theory that the court made it
decision. Had the evidence been admitted
the state was prepared to put on the
witness stand numerous victims of al
leged crimes by Hauser to show that he
usually attacked a man and woman to
gether and insulted tl--women. These
victims would have identified Huilser as
their assailant.

LONDON. Jan. IS. The newn from the '
eastern front of the cnpnire of Hsrtnifitra i
is regarded in military circles as prob- ;
ably true, although offli'iat annnuncpintMit '
on the subject has not been received .
The town, Just northweat of Cserunwlts, ;
is a conversing point for five aoort roads, '
and In of great strategic importance. Prior
(attempts to capture it have been sloutly
resisted.
The report from IetroBra,l (ha. the of-
! renslve In Callria und HensarahlH hn
been suspended for the present Is
garded as at least premature. The Ru
j an offensive could not. It Is believed, be
'suspended suddenly, as It wss undertaken
j after careful preparations and launched
a'wlth unexpected strength. The object
of that offensive Is said to be threefold:
To demonstrate to the Rumanians that
the Russian forces are able to assume the
Initiative when they choose; secondly, to
divert Austro-Qerman forces from the
Balkanst, the western front and, finally,
to Improve the general strategic position
of their own left flank.
When the full effect or this Russian ol
fenseive canno yet be determined, entente
military experts affirm that the tiecond
object was attained; that the situation In
the Balkans was sensibly relieved and .
that the operatlqns . undertaken by. the
Germans against the French' in Cham- !
pagne was robbed of its force.
Alllrs Occupy t'orfa.
The fact that the French flag now la
waving over the place on the Island of
Corfu, which belonged to the Oerman ;
emperor, and that the occupation of the I
Greek Island by the entente la considered ;
as complete, has, It Is reported, already '
! Intentions. Greece, It Is understood, takes (
a sympathetic view of the entente action, j
I aa It is for the purpose of preventing the
! Serbian army from risking the danger of j
starvation. !

The German offensive in Champngnr, j
which reached its culmination Sunday,
Insistently reported from French hesd- i
quarters as having been undertaken on !

to have ben complete, and the stromc 1
