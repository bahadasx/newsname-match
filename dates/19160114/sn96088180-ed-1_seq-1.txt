BY SCRAP ON SHIP
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
The Hague, Jan. 14. A wild acene
In which several lenders of the Ford
pence expedition exchanged blows at
Chrlatlanla. took place before Henry
Ford sped by auto to catch a train
for Borgen in order to make bis boat
for America. Information from a
trustworthy source today revealed the
"Inside story" of events aboard the
Oscar II at Chrlatlanla. It waa learn
ed that Ford first Investigated
Madame Schwlmmor's claims that she
had documents from belligerent and
neutral rulers encouraging the Ford
peace move, after there had been a
quarrel aboard over President Wil
son's preparednosa program. Ford
found that the documents were po
litely phrased declarations of
nothing, and that they were entirely
worthless.
Sadly disappointed at this turn of
affairs, Ford retired to his cabin, In
mortification, under the pretenso that
he was 111. He remained practically
Incommunicado for the remainder of
the trip. He still hoped that an en
thusiastic reception from Scandi
navia would glvo him some chance
for the success of the expedition. But
when the Norwegians received him
with contempt, Ford determined to
return to the United States and had
Dean Marquis, a chauffeur, and two
other men arrange his flight.
Madame Schwlmmor, Secretary
Lochncr and other Intimates were
Ignorant of his plans, but they hap
pened to see the quartet smuggling
Ford Into an automobile. But as he
waa being kidnaped several members
of tho Schwlmmer faction threw
themselves at the auto, crying:
"Murderers! v Kidnapers!"
The chauffeur was no pacificist.
And, besides, he had his orders, so
ho circled his fists vigorously, and the
Schwlmmerltes retreated, whllo Ford
escaped.
Thore Is a general belief that Ma
dame Schwlmmor's connection with
khe voyage Is In behalf of Teuton pro
paganda.
Wilmington, Del., Jan. 14,-Four

Further Trouble Is Anticipated
in Border City Where Anger
Is At White Heat Over
Murders in Mexico
Kl Paso, Jan. 14. Expecting a re
currence tonight of the antRMexlcan
rioting that shook tho city last night,
military officials this afternoon made
all preparations to meet It.
A provost guard of 250 infantry
men patrolled the Mexican quarter
and cavalrymon with loaded revolv
ers and rifles were held in resfdlness
to enter the downtown streets before
dark, though their presence during
tbo day had been unnecessary.
As a special precaution against
trouble, General Pershing, command
er here, prohibited the holding of a
mass meeting In Cleveland square
this afternoon, at which ex-Governor
Curry of New Mexico, a former mem
ber of congress and once a member
of Roosevelt's rougbrlders, was to
have been the principal speaker. The
meeting was called ss a result of the
massacre of 18 Americans Monday
and authorities feared it might cause
a wild Incendiary outburst among the
already high-strung populace.
The reported arrest of General
Rodriguez, a Villlsta bandit leader
at iMadera, was vouched for only by
the local Carranza council.
The reported massacre of 12 Amer
icans at Madera was discredited.
While the city was quiet today, the
people were decidedly "nervous" over
what the night might bring. Indigna
tion at the Santa Ysabel murders had
not abated; In fact, It was fanned by
a city full of American mining men
and cattlement driven out of Mexico,
who bitterly condemn tho adminlstra
tlon'a "watchful waiting" policy of
inactivity.
The martial law regulations that
prevailed in the city last night dur
ing the anti-Mexican outbreak were
slightly relaxed today, though with
the provost guard on duty in the
Mexican quarter most of the denizens
of that section remained within doors,
terrorized, fearing to run afoul of
riotous Americans or into a bayonet
it they ventured into the American
quarter.
OF MEXICO, IS
El Paso, Jan. 14. General Heurta,
once Mexico's "man of iron and
blood," lies here today,1 his corpse
virtually the prisoner of the United
States government, with which he
nearly went to war when, as dictator
of Mexico, ho refused to salute the
Stars and Stripes after the historic
Tamplco incident.
Ho died last night at the age ofl
61, following several operations re
sulting in sclerosis of the liver. His
wish to end his days In his native
land was prevented by his arrest and
indictment as a plotter to crush the
do facto Carranza government of
Mexico.
Huerta's widow plans to seek per
mission for Internment near Colotlan,
Jalisco, 'Mex., where the grim old
warrior was born. Whether Car
ranza will permit this, however, is
doubtful, for Carranza holds Huerta
was responsible for the assassination
of President iMadero and Vice
President Simrei of Mexico in Feb
ruary, 1913, and may feel that even i
In death the "Iron man" ought not I
to rest on Mexican soil.
General Vtctorlano Huerta, who
GENERAL
KUERTA
Head of the Mexican Govern
ment Says That Murderers
of American Party Will
Meet Condign" Punishment
Washington, Jan. 14. General
Carranza today Bent a message to
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo that
the murderers of the American party
in Chihuahua are being pursued, and
that tbfiy will "meet condign pun
ishment." From thla message the adminis
tration saw substantiation of its view
that Carranza la doing all he can to
meet American demands and to
guard against recurrences of the
Santa Ysabel massacres. In these
circumstances the government is in
clined to await developments. And,
as Indicated by Senator Stone today,
the administration has no intention
of now hampering Carranza's efforts
by engaging in intervention. .
Carranza's message read:
"The murderous attack on a pas
senger train near Chihuahua City
was made by the only remaining band
of outlaws In thst region. It Is being
actively pursued In order to insure
capture, whereupon the condign pun
ishment which the crime deserves
will be meted out to every guilty
participant. Constitutionalist troops
have been ordered to establish strong
patrols from end to end of the rail
way line in order to forfend against
similar outrages.
"You will make this declaration
to the press of the United States."

"Iron man" in the village of Colotlan,
Jalisco, Mexico, December 23, 1S54.
Indian blood coursed in his veins and
marked him with the fierce stolidity
that Mexico came at last to fear.
The spirit of the soldier seemed
Ingrained. From early boyhood the
love of fighting, tho tFtrill of arms,
was upon him.
So It was that he got a military
training In the military academy of
Chapultepec, from which he was
graduated in 1876. In the brief
schooling he had previously, and
throughout his military course, he
proved himself thirsty for knowl
edge and an apt pupil. From his
humble start, as an ordinary Indian

maneuvering, untiring efforts and
brilliant military efforts to the post

ministration and refused for some
time to depart.

London, Jan. 14. Documents
taken from the recalled German At
tache von Papen of the Washington
embassy recently at Falmouth show
ed that he paid $1,800 to the German
consulate at Seattle for Werner Horn,
who attempted to dynamite the
Vanceboro, M., international, bridge
last spring, according to the foreign
office today. This payment was made
a fortnight before Horn made his at
tempt. The foreign office said this was the
last installment sent to Horn, while
other portions of the documents show
that German Ambassador von Bern-
storff gave von Papen several checks.
One of these was for $2,000 on the
Rlggs bank of Washington, the day
before Horn was paid a $700 install
ment. The documents have been sent
to Washington to aid the state de
partment in Investigation of anti-ally
conspiracies in America.
Horn was a former German army
officer. He Is under indictment on a
charge of illegally transporting ex
plosives. Officials took him into cus
tody on American soil after the at
tempt was made hist February to
blast the Vanceboro bridge, over
which great trains pass daily between
Canada and the United States.
Seattle, Jan. 14. German Consul
Zoepffel, of Seattle, declared today.
when his attention was called to the
London statement that Attache Ton
Papen had paid the German consulate
at Seattle $1,800 for Werner Horn,
the alleged attempted dynamiter, that
he had never had any personal cor
respondence with von Papen.
"I know nothing of any such busi
ness," he said, "and have never heard
anything mentioned regarding it since
I took office here last June. I con
slder It Incredible absolutely in
conceivable."
SLAV ENVOY WILL
CONFER WITH JAPS
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
San Francisco, Jan. 14. A con
clave, perhaps of vast import in its
effect on the outcome of the Euro
pean war, is slated for Tokio within
a few days.
This was revealed today when
Francisco Ortea, Argentine minister
to Japan, arrived here on a Japanese
liner. Participating in the confer
ence will be the mikado, the Russian
special envoy, Duke-Mlklovltch, and
a British envoy. Presumably their
session will be to seek a broader par
tlcipation by Japan in the Btruggle
The duke already is in Toklo, os
tensibly to carry the congratulations
of Czar Nicholas to the mikado. But
Ortes intimated that this la merely
perfunctory, and that, instead, his
presence in Japan la fraught with
significance.
Inasmuch as there has been some
talk of a German-Japanese alliance
after the present war, and as it Is
known Japan has been exceedingly
courteous to German war prisoners,
there is a hint in some quarters that
the entente allies are angling to pre
vent such a combination.
Still another suggestion is that the
recent torpedoing of Japanese Bteam
era In the Mediterranean may be con
sidered and that means may be taken
to combat such incidents In the
future.
In connection with the suggestion
that the entente may desire to thwart
a poBBtble German-Japanese alliance,
It is recalled that Lord Northcllffe of
England, in an article for the United
Press recently, hinted at the posslbll
lty thereof. War experts, too, have

King Nicholas Agrees to a
Truce With Invaders When
Capital City of Cettinje Is
About to Be Devastated
Rome, Jan. 14. Montenegro's va
liant fight against Austrian odds Is
at an end.
Austrian artillery was trained on
Cettinje, the ancient capital of the
kingdom, with gunners waiting only
a signal to lay the city in ruins, when
King Nicholas agreed to an armistice
which virtually eliminated Monte
negro from the war. ; i
The sovereign wept as he agreed
to a truce that probably means com
plete surrender. He called together
his commanders and expressed a will
ingness to take to. the mountains and
to fight the invaders to the very end.
but they persuaded him that continu
ance of the straggle, unaided, meant
eventually more misery than Serbia
or Belgium suffered at the hands of
Teuton foemen.
Formal negotiations for surrender
of the half-starved and poorly equip
ped little army are expected to begin
Immediately, - While no definite
period has been set for continuance
of the armistice, it Is believed that
a tentative peace will be arranged
before the end of the month. -
Italian military officials believe
that thousands of Montenegrins will
reject such an outcome and instead
retire to their mountain fastnesses,
there to wage a guerilla warfare. '
Though the Montenegrin legation
today had no confirmation of the re
port that General Koevess and King
Nicholas had signed a truce, they In
clined to believe the report The
foreign office here, too, was without
confirmation.
There was no criticism of King
Nicholas' course. Instead, on every
hand there was commendation of his
brave stand against superior forces.
Mount Lowcen, commanding Cet
tinje, and regarded for centuries as
unconquerable, apparently succumb
ed to modern artillery. And, with
Cettinje In their hands, the Austrians
had what long they had coveted, a
position giving them a stranglehold
upon the Adriatic sea and removing
a menace to their naval operations
out of Cattaro.
Vienna, Jan. 14. The Austrians
have occupied Cettinje, Montenegrin
capital, according to an official an
nouncement today.
"Austro-Hungarian troops pursu-
slng the defeated enemy entered
Cettinje unharmed. The populace Is
calm," said the announcement
The above official statement carried
no confirmation of Rome's story that
the Montenegrin king and the Aus
trians had agreed to an armistice.
