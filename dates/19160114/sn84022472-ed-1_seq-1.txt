"Up toSthis time," said Senator
Works, addressing the Senate, "Con

for conditions in Mexico to rest upon
the President-- . It -Is too: grave a re-r
; eponsibillty. We 'have all sympathized
' with the President, ,with the hope that

now that such a peaceful outcome, is
possible. -.
' 'Xongress alone has the rigM to de

s3ig Rupture.
: How an.-' humble' Greenwich, cab

than $90,000 is involved and how the
latter had led to an open rupture be-
tween some -of the . most, prominent

resident of .Field's Point, Greenwich.
Bills of $2,000 tor taxi cabs and $1,

At present Mrs. McNall is visiting
In Florida : and , although Greenwich
L tradesmen . are clamoring for ' money
1 they claim, is due, she has given them
no .satisfaction. ; It is claimed that
.bills-owed to grocers and meat deal

Mrs. ' MctNall - owns property in
Greenwich i worth $50,000.. . -,It - was
said today that she and her husband
are 'not legally separated although
he refused to settle some of the bills
owed by Mrs. McNall. , It was about
three weeks ago-. that she filed a petition-
in bankruptcy. , . .
. A lively tilt between Attorney ' So
field Jennings of Stamford, represent
ing the bankrupt, Attorneys Warren
Cressy. -William S. Hirschberg and
William C. Rungee, representing cred
itors,, of Greenwich, caused a temporary-adjournment
of the proceedings
that the attorneys might agree wheth
er Stamford real estate men are .capa
ble of dealing in Greenwich property,
which s said to be operated on dif
ferent plans than any other realty in
Connecticut, owing to Its New Tork
affiliations. - '' . .
Another phase brought up . In the
argument was the Intermarriage and
close affiliation of Greenwich people,
which was thought sufficiently strong
to - morally disqualify men whose
names were mentioned from acting in
the sale of the residence, which for
mer Judge of Probate George G.
McNall and his wife,, Emma F., had
occupied., . -
The application for involuntary
bankruptcy brought in November "last
by the Greenwich Cab Co., through
their attorneys, .'Walsh & Wright,
and the schedules filed with Judge
Thomas at " Hartfdrd, disclose that
the bankruptcy 1 was forced by the
cabmen ,upon notes forN$550, at a time
when it was alleged an attempt to ob
tain - preference was being made by
the. Mutual Life Insurance. Co. of
New York, in an attachment on Mrs.
McNall's real estate at Greenwich. It
was this small claim that precipitat
ed ' the filing of liabilities amounting
to $91,550.93 against, the estate and
the Judgment of bankruptcy on No
vember 29. 1915.
At the conclusion of the first meet

made by Brown and Spellman. Offic
er Moulton corroborated the .testimony
of O'Neil relative to the so-called con
fessions. ' 'v.'.
"Spellman at first denied all knowl
edge of the crime," Moulton, said,s "but
after being confronted by Healis he
confessed and said hey shot down
Mohr . because Mrs. Mohr asked them
to do it. Asked what Spellman said,
Healis, said: 'Well, if lie'says its true
I suppose it is. "
- Brown, according to' Moulton said
Mrs. Mohr had . beerr- after him three

.' "Did the chief ask him about Mrs.
"'nTir during that hour?' "Mrs.
Mohr's name was not mentioned at
that . time," Moulton replied.

clared . positively - that under the ai--:
rangements agreed upon he was to

The. capacity of the Seaview avenue

installation of additional boilers for

Prior to the recent fire four gen

to this city 1 from outside cities.
It has been decided bjr the trustees

to install in Bridgeport one generator
that .will develop alone. 6,000 kilo

ply for emergency. , ;
In order to furnish this new gener
ator with steam plans are being laid
to remove a part of the boiler equip

Rome Says That Hostilities May Be Concluded
By Separate Peace Pact With Austrians.
Vienna, Jan. 14 The capture of Cettinje, capital of Monte
negro, was announced today by the war office.
The official, announcement states: 1
"The capital of Montenegro is in our . hands. Our troops, ,
pursuing the beaten enemy, yesterday afternoon entered Get-:
tinje. ' The residences of the Montenegrin King and the town:
are undamaged. The population is calm."
The fall of Cettinjebefore the in
vading Austrian forces which greatly
outnumber the comparatively small
Montenegrin armies was regarded as
a matter of only a short time after
the capture by the Austrians of Mount
Lovcen. Cettinje is only six miles
from that stronghold.
The present .location of the Monte
negrin capital is uncertain, but it is"
assumed the seat of government was
removed to some point in the interior
when it became apparent that Cet
tinje was in peril. There, haver been
conflicting reports as to the where
abouts of King Nichojas, but he and
the officials of his government prob
ably have taken refuge in the moun
tains". N !
"With- Cettinje in the 'hands of the
Austrians, the Montenegrins are
hemmed in on almost .every side and,
Unlike the Serbians, have little op
portunity to retreat beyond , the bor
ders of their country.
Cettinje is a small and unpreten
tious town whose population 20 years
ago was less than 30,000. It is situ
ated in a narrow valley at an eleva
tion of 2,000 feet.

tively "announced today that the re
ported offensive of the Teutonic al
lies against Saloniki did not occur.
The rumors that 'the attack had been
begun against, the forces of the allies
apparently, originated in the .activity
of the French in blowing up the
bridges connecting .Saloniki with the
road over which the attackers would
normally travel. Bridges were de
stroyed by the French not only at
Demir Hissar, on the Strumma in the
neighlSbrhood of Serres, but also at
Kilinder, south of 'Doiran. , All the
bridges destroyed were in Greek ter
ritory. ;
The rumors that Austria and Mon
tenegro have suspended hostilities for
the purpose of discussing arrange
ments whereby further warfare on
Montenegrin soil should be stopped
may be( based simply on the fact that
the Austrian advance in Montenegro
has become so slow that suspicion
of a suspension of hostilities is nat

Divorce from Spouse Who

Declaring that her husband told her
he wanted to divorce her so he could
irarry a girl with money, Ella Hoyt
Wheeler of this city appeared before
Judge Gager in the superior court this
afternoon to seek a divoroa from
George Wheeler of parts unknown.
On the night of March- 12, 1905
Wheeler left home and the next day
sent the following note to his wife:
"L have left you for good and all.
Please send back my clothes."
Mrs. Wheeler said her husband had
no sense of responsibility. He did not
support her and she had a hard time
trying to take care of herself and her
child. The couple: were married
June 30, 1901. Judge Gager grant
ed the decree.
Mary Fildes of this city was grant
ed a divorce from William Fildes of
this city. Intolerable cruelty was the
ground. The plaintiff said her hus
band beat her when intoxicated and
although he. made many promises to
reform he didn't keep them. She fin
ally left Fildes last July. The couple
were married in 1894 in England.
The -court allowed 'May Louise Haw
ley of 73 Seymour street a decree from
Arthur Hawley on the grounds of
cruelty. Mrs. Hawley said her hus
band threatened her with a knife,
choked her and otherwise abused
her. . Once when she locked the door

Speculation Is rife as to - the atti

grave menace to Italy interests. '
The ,fact that Italy's superior fleet 1
did not prevent an Austrian squadron
from assisting in the reduction of :
Mount Lovcen, which dominates the'
harbor of Cattaro, is being comment- j
ed upon, though experts admi, that '
chere is not a sufficient basis of in- 1
formation from which to draw deduc- !
tions in the 'matter and they suggest
that Italy's action in the present junc
