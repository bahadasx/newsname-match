BLOODY HUERTA DIES

Hueria, the "iron man 7

a smile on his steel
hardened face.
For what grander music
could the kind fates have
offered as an accompani
ment to his last heart beat
than the cries of enraged
rioters, the groans of the
wounded Mexicans and the
tramp of soldiers' feet on
the streets of ft Paso?
Yes, and the distant echo
of the mighty worid-war.
Strange, that the fierce In
dian blood should have se
lected that time and place
to run its last.
Huerta was born with the noise of warfare and
slaughter ringing in his eaVs. And that's the way
he died. Death could have held no more terror
for him than did the flash of cold steel.
The spirit of the soldier was ingrained. From
early boyhood the love of fighting, the thrill of
arms, was upon him.
From his humble start as an ordinary Indian
in the humble Jalisco village, he won his way to
the post of Mexican president by his war-loving
fearles3i:3ss, by his shrewdness, by the very cru
elty and relentlessness of his cold heart.
The United States at last forced him from the
goal of his efforts, but not until he had hurled
back a torrent of scorn aid defiance. When he
did go, it was with the cold pride of a man who
had tasted brute power and who, even in defeat,
would not admit he had been crushed.
The riot cries of revenue for the massacre of
Americans were final honors at the closing of a
blood-soaked career. »

Ford, it seems, investigated
Madame Schwlmmer's claim that
she bad documents from belliger

the documents politely phrased
declarations of "nothing," abso
lutely worthless.
Sadly disappointed, Ford re

They recalled the pictures of Huerta basking
in the favor of Francisco Madero, then his alli

tator, with Madero assassinated on his way from
the president's palace to prison; Madero's broth

his guards after being told he could go free.
With these pictures flashed before him, a pris

rounded out his career, smiling at the tumult of
El Paso blood riots and scorning the final death
