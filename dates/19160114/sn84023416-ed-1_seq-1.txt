WINTER OVERCOATS

L. F.JONES,DRYGD
No. 14. fast express between
Montreal and Portland, leaving
Montreal at 8:20, due 'it this point
at 1:55 a.m., was delayed about five
hours Sunday morning owing to a
derailment at Keenans Crossing
aboat thirteen miles west, the cause
being defective switch fastenings.
The engine and mail car passel over
the switch without mishap, the front
trucks of the baggage car followed
the main line, the rear trucks tak
ing the siding and causing the first
and second class cars and pullman to
follow, crashing into several pulp
racks on the siding. Tfie baggage
car turned turtle but the remainder
of the train fortunately was only de
railed. A small office situated be
tween the main line and the cross
ing, occupied by William Pickford,
scaler for the Berlin Mills Company,
was completely demolished, ex
cept one side, it being struck by
one of the cars. Mr. Pickford at
the time of the accident was asleep
and escaped being injured as his
bunk was situated on the side that
remained intact. Mr. Pickford,
however, had trouble finding his
clothing and enjoyed much discom
fort in the thirty below weather.
Baggageman Allen of Portland" re
ceived minor injuries and bruises. It
was very fortunate that the bag
gage was light, otherwise Mr. Allen,
no doubt, would have been killed;
as it was he was unconscious about
twenty minutes after being taken
from the car. Custom Inspector
Francis Johnson received injuries
about the back and knee, it being
necessary to consult a specialist in
Sherbrooke. Mr. Johnson 1s now
able to be about his duties. The
passengers, about thirty in number,
received minor bruises and cuts, a
num' or of them being examined at
this point by Dr. Sargent, and oth
ers by the company's doctor in Ber
lin. The wrecking crew at Island
Pond was called out, taking them
several days to clear the wreckage.
Owing to the promptness of thrt
officials and workmen in clearing
the wreck; ge and getting reports of
the accident the passengers experi
enced hardly any inconvenience as a
train was made up which left this
point at 7 a.m.
The Passing of an Honored
Professional Man.
On Sunday evening, Jan. 2nd, at
8:30 p.m., Dr. Artemas Ward of
Canaan, Vt., after a brief illness f
a few days, passed on to his reward.
An illustrious character has passed
out from the family circle, the ac
tive life of the community, the state
and the nation.
No argument is needed to awake
the sympathies of a grateful people
on the doctor's passing. The doc
tor's personality and life in the
social, political, professional and
economic life of the town and sur
rounding communities for thirty
four years speaks for itself.
The death of public benefactors
disburdens itself by a flow of sorrow.
This sorrow is an inseparable senti
ment of nature, 'nd an indispensable
duty of religion. But, if that sor
row is a submissive sorrow, it may
be sanctified to the good of those
who mourn.
While argument is not needed to
awake the sympathies of a grateful
people in regard to the doctor's ex
odus from our community life, yet
it seems fitting that a few words
should be recorded.
A community's gloiy is the
glory of her good men, of which the
doctor was one. The monuments of
good meu are not alone those marble
pillars at the heads of graves, but
the greatest monument to them is
found in the warm'Iiving and loving
hearts of relatives, friends and
neighbors who survive, and there
will be many of s.chin our com
munity as a memorial to Dr. Ward.
It is a solemn event when God te
moves from a community the mi;i:l
and heait He has so highly endowed.
The doctor's death has cast a gloem
,A,r idi' c-.!;-muiii .. he, i.: . -.i ;
because of its suddeness. He wis
in his usual health up to a few days
before the summons came. Every
thing was done that could be done
by the counsel of physicians, the
trained nurse and the wife ind sis
ters to ward off the dread messenger,
but on Sunday nia-ht at 8:30 o'clock
ihe spirit broke the bars asunder
and took its dtparture.
Dr. Ward was born in Worthing
ton, Mass., Jan. 4, 1847. He was a
graduate of the medical departnn nt
of U. V. M. of Burlington, Vt. He
started practice as a physician in
Canaan, Vt., in the year 1882. In
1885 he was united in marriage to
Miss Alice Harvey who now survives
him. He is also survived by two
sisters, Mrs. Hoilis and Mrs. J. D.
Seymoui of Whately, Mass.
Dr. Ward was a practicing physi
cian in the town of Canaan from
1882 to 1908 when he retired, but
since his retirement seven years ago
he has been in hundreds of counsels
in serious cases and his counsels and
advice have proven to be wise. His
practice here ".vas characterized by
thoughtfulness for the poor who
wore his patients and many others
who were worthy, lie had a tender
heart for servant girls, realizing the
small wage paid them he gave them
free medical service. For many
years the doctor has been counsellor
and advisor to both the young and
those of riper yeats and these
counsels will be a lasting memorial
to his name. He was one of the
most liberal-hearted citizens that the
town could boast of. In years gone
by, many were the Christmas baskets
sent out to the poor an needy and
other acts of kindness that the pub
lic knew nothing of. His kindness
and benevolent acts were all done in
a quiet manner which characterizes
the hearts of true men. He never
in all his active life sought office.
Notwithstanding this, his keen in
sight into the needs of the commun
ity life of t'le town and county af
fairs led numbers of influential men
to seek his advice upon those issues
that were vital to the social and
municipal interests of the same. If
money were to be raised for benevo
lent, fraternal or social purposes
the doctor was unanimously appoint
ed as committee and the reason was
that he had the confidence of all
claSLs. He was, and is, an honored
member of "The Masonic Temple
and The Knights-of Pythias." These
orders will miss his fellowship, his
counsels, his smiling face and his
congenial personality in the years to
come, but much that he did to build
up those orders and sustain them
will be prized by his brother masons
and knights.
L st March he was appointed one
of the public school directors of the
town of Canaan and during the time
of service his counsels have been
wise and appreciated. His visits to
the schools w'll be missed by the
teaching staff and by the children.
The children on the streets will miss
his kindly greeting and tender re
membrances. Rev. W. C. Christie, pastor of
Grace Methodist Episcopal church of
Canaan .delivered the funeral address
and offered prayer. Rev. Mr. Hooper
of Colebrook, N. II., read Whittier's
poem on "Eternal Goodness," and
offered the closing prayer and pro
nounced the benediction. The Ma
sonic order took charge of the ser
vices from the house, the procession
passing through the single files of
school children drawn up upon the
square out of respect to their bene
factor and friend. He was buried
with full honors bv his Masonic
brethren. The floral offerings were

years ago, when playing Hamlet, he
found himself In that scene on the
ramparts when lie awaits the approach
of the ghost, gasping for breath and
drenched with the dew of apprehen

himself. "My back la to the audience,
the scene Is in darkness. Why shoufd
I waste so much mental force? Why
not stand at rest, awaiting my cue
with a cool pulse?" Bnt a trial quick
ly showed him his error. He had
difficulty to get back into the character,
and, moreover, he discovered that the
scene did not grip the audience with
