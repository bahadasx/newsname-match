Permanent Board Named to Carry on

The Hague, Jan. 14.—The Ford peace

American members of. the permanent

efforts to settle the war: William
Jennings Bryan, Henry Ford, Miss
Jane Addams, the Rev. Charles F.

Five other members will be chosen
later.

The -board will be composed of an
equal number of members from the
various neutral countries and will re

the financial backing of Mr. Ford.
Each member will receive a salary,

probably will amount to 1500,000 year

offer his resignation from his San

Lively discussions among the mem

adoption being urged because Mr. Ford

Washington, Jan. 14.—General Car*
ranza today telegraphed his ambas
sador here as follows, from his head
quarters at Queretaro:
The murderous attack on the pas
senger train near Chihuahua was made
by the only remaining band of outlawa
in that region. This band is being pur
sued by my troops with a view to in
sure its capture, whereupon punish
ment which their crime deserves will
bo applied to every guilty participant.
"Troops of tho constitutionalist gov
ernment have been ordered to estab
llsh patrol from end to end of the rail
road line In order to foresend against
similar outrages."
General Carranza's dispatch was tho
first direct assurances that he will
comply with the urgent representa
tions of the United States government.
At today's cabinet meeting it was
decided that the present policy would
be continued and Carranza would bo
relied upon to punish the bandits.
Carranza Must 'Restore Order.
Chairman Stone, of the senat^ for
eign relations committee, conferred on
the Mexican situation today with
President Wilson. He aaid he waa
gathering Information with which to
meet the attack on the administration 5
in the senate.
Senator Stone said ho did not ex
peot American troops would be sent
into Mexioo unless futuro events
forced it. He said the enraged Villa
faction was attempting to force in
terventlon.
He said the administration will look
to Carranza to punUh tbo bandita.

"It would be monstrous fo* tho
United States to go to war In Mexico
at such a time as this," declared Sena
tor Stone, after his return to the canl
tal.
"We should give the Mexican gov
ernment a chance to suppress and
punish the bandit bands that have
murdered American citizens. We know
these bandits are seeking blood of
Americans for revenge. I think that
Americans who venture Into such
places and Americans who venture
forth on belligerent ships Into the war
zone, are committing a crime against
the government whose protection tKey
seek. Of course, we must try to pro
tect them. They have a technical legal
right to go Into danger places, but
they should not do it, if possible to
avoid it, and thus embarrass the United
States.
"I am not convinced that It will not
be necessary to go into Mexico."
Senator Works, republican, of Cali
fornia, today introduced a resolution,
authorizing and directing the president
to intervene in Mexico and establish
and maintain a government there until
It is safe to withdraw.
Works Urges intervention.
"Up to this time." said Senator
Works, addressing the senate, "con
gress has permitted all responsibility
for conditions In Mexico to rest upon
the president. It is too grave a re
sponsibility.
'^Congress alone has the right to de
clare war and congress should shoulder
the responsibility. I ask that the res
olution be referred to the foreign re
lations committee."
The resolution was so referred.
Senator Lodge submitted the same
resolution he offered April 21,1914, as
a substitute for the resolution the sen
ate then adopted, authorizing the pres
ident to use armed forces in Mexico
to enforce its demands on General
Huerta, and asked that it be printed In
the record.
"That resolution," said Senaton
Lodge, "expressed the republican atti
tude regarding the war against Huerta.
That war has reached a successful
termination as Mr. HueVta has Just
died In Jail."
