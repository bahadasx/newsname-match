GETTING A START
NATHANIEL C. FOWLER, Jr.
tCupyrglt.t 1i, by tL. MA~Clure Nwspa&r ByndicatoJ
HEALTH AND SALARY.
Good health is not always a gift of
nature. Like other commodities, it
may be acquired or earned.
Seventy-five per cent of our ailments
are self-made or self-induced.
Nature intended to start us in health
and to keep us well, and most of us
can have the health we want if we
will, unless we are prenatally handi
capped.
Nature does her part, is forever giv
ing us health, and attempting to dispel
disorder. But nature alone can no
more guarantee good health than can
glassware insure itself against break
age.
Business has not time or inclination
for sympathy. It is its province to
make money, and it cannot, under pres
ent conditions, tolerate either indif
ference, inefficiency, incapacity, or ill
health. It demands the best there is
in us if we would succeed.
If one cannot meet business require
ments in the main, it will have nothing
to do with him, and will relegate him
to the scrap heap. It is just as much
your duty to keep in good health, if
you can, as it is to be on time at the
office in the morning and to work faith
fully during the business day.
Your employer has a right to de
mand health of you, as well as faith
fulness. While he may sympathize
with you if you are suffering from
some ailment for which you may or
may not be responsible, hIe cannot de
pend upon you, or promote you, or
give you full opportunity unless your
physical condition is up to normal or
strong enough to permit you to do your
duty with a fair degree of efficiency.
Statistics show that poor health is
second only to dissipation and extrava
gance as the cause of commercial dis
aster.
The physically weak man who takes
care of himself is often better able to
work than is one of robust health who
is dissipated, extravagant, indifferent
and careless.
You cannot mete a normal !uccess
of business unless you are normal both
physically and mentally; your brain
cannot do its full work unless it is
supported by a healthy body, and your
body cannot be in good condition un
less It is given as good care as that
bestowed upon the heartless engine or
the nerveless loom.
Late hours, overeating, lack of exer
cise, and every form of mild or other
dissipation oredisposes one to physical
downfall, resulting in mental inca
pacity and in the inability to accom
plish.
To abuse your body is robbing your
self and your employer as much as
you would be doing if you deliberately
cast your savings into the sea or
emptied his cash drawer.
Your body has been given you as a
sacred heritage. lk has been placed in
your care and you will be held re
sponsible for It.
Health stands for comfort, pleasure,
peace of mind, and prosperity.
If you are strong, keep yourself
strong; if you are weak, take all the
more care of yourself. Look upon
yoea body as not a mere physical as
set, but as an investment, to be hus
btled and to be protected more than
you would the family jewels or the
savings of your lifetime. You can lose
money and regain It. If you lose your
health, you may not be able to find it.
Utilizing All the Ground.
This country is so new and so given
to thinking of farms as huge areas
for cultivation that the idea of utiliz
ing every bit of land as Europeans
do, makes little headway here. Inten
sive cultivation ;a practiced. but on
the outskirts of eastern cities, where
some farmers are making good liv
ings by intensive cultivation of small
tracts of land there are other tracts
Just as good lying~ idle which at least
could be made to yield vegetable suip
plies for several families and at the
same time pay a small rental if cul
tivated by a few workmen in their
spare time. School children's gardens
on vacant lots in various st ctions of
this city show the possibilities of such
ventures. The old American idea that
every family with access to a bit of
land should have its own garden was
an excellent one. It woul(id be good to
have it revived -New York Tribune
Basque Language.
The Basque language is like no oth
er at present spoken in the civilized
world, though it has many features in
common with the languages of the
North American Indians. Of it iHaron
Alexander von Hlumboldt once wrotre
"The words are spelled Napoleon and
pronounced Nebuchadnezzar." The
Basques, so tar as history treats of
them, have always been a quiet, pas
toral and agricultural neople. Evin in
America they are known as good hlledl
ers o0 sheep and milkers of kine. "'cole
lum, non animam, mutant ;rui trans
mare current,' so we find that the man
whom this story concerns, when about)
twenty-one years of age,. crossed the
seas and under new skies took up
once again the customs of his race
and became a shepherd. and later a
sheep-owner and rancher.
HE CLOSED THE DOOR.
of John was an iceman. For years he
it had driven his wagon along the city
boulevards and through the hack al
a leys. lie was a strong, husky fellow.
popular with the boss and with his cus
h tonmers. lie was accommodating, and
B his ringing "Good morning" was al
e ways welcome. He was ambitious, but
I. didn't know it; was satisfied because
over his horizon little had arisen save
a horse and an Ice cart.
d1 Among his customers was a multi
o millionaire, the president of a bank
n and the owner of the largest factory
i. in the city. The basement door was
located under his library. Every morn
n ing this man of business sat before
o the open window, or before the glow
i. Ing grate, and read his morning paper.
(. Old as he was, busy as he always had
I been, his eye had not lost its power of
s penetration or his ear its acuteness.
He saw and he heard more than most
} men.
g The grocery boys, the market men,
a and others delivered their goods below
h his window, and every one, save the
f iceman, slammed the door when he
e went out; but John always closed it
. softly.
One day, as John was leaving, the
. millionaire poked his head out of the
window and exclaimed: "Say, you
e man, why don't you slam the doors
n like the other fellows?"
r John was confused for a moment.
then he pulled himself together and
r replied:
r "What's the use of being a nuisance
r when you don't have to be?"
r "Got a moment to spare?" asked the
millionaire.
a "Sure." replied John.
i. "Come upstairs."
i. John, in heavy boots and overalls,
with hat in hand, stood at the library
a door.
o "Sit down, my man," said the mil
o lionaire.
,t John perched himself on the arm of
a chair.
a "Get into that chair. so as to be
h comfortable."
n John slid into the seat.
a "Here, have a cigar." and the busi
r ness man pushed a box toward him
I. The iceman held the cigar in his
.t fingers, not daring to light it.
r "Light up, sir. While you're smok
ing, I have something to say to you.
r- Like your job?"
r "Why, yes, sir," replied John in sur
I prise.
"Ever thought of getting something
l- better?"
"Guess I ain't fit for anything else."
"I differ with you." said the million-;
a sire emphatically. "You are the only
y gentleman who delivers goods at my
r house; the only one who is consider
ate, who thinks while he works. I
a won't ask who you are or what you
i are. I want a doorkeeper at my fac
tory office. The Job is yours."
In a week John was at his post. In
a year he was promoted. Today he
isn't a partner, and he isn't superin
f tendent o'f the factory, but he is draw
e ing two thousand a year, and is the
a most popular man on the premises.
Shutting the door softly isn't much,
I is it? But it is one of those little
I things, which people don't have to do,
a that mark the man who does them.
e In the arithmetic of life the deci
r mals as well as the big figures count.
Don't take chances with little things.
They are often more important than
those which seem to loom larger on
D the horizon.
Why Glass Doesn't Stop Light.
Why doesn't the closed window shut
out light just as much as it shuts out
sound? Iloth light and sound travel
e through the air and their waves come
in contact with the glass. The light,
after it has gone through the window,
seems Just as strong or stronger, while
the sound seems ever so much weaker.
Why is it? many of us have wondered.
e The reason is that light is not a
wave of air. while sound is. Light is
ra wave in the ether which is in the -
a glass as well as in the air. so that light
in passing through glass still has its
natural path of ether.
t Itut when soutnd waves strike the
Swindow giass they must put the glass
into vibration., and the glass in turn
Smust make the air inside vibrate. All
this l'Issens the strength of the sound
waves and they reach our ears capable
of prodcitilg a less startling effect
than the light waves which reach our
I eyes.
Midnight Causes III Health.
I Not too mu('hli sunlight, but too much a
midnight is the real nerve destroying
I factor at most pleasure resorts.
lIancing, highballs, bridge, pinochle,
poker, swimming, are the practices
that are oftenest overdone. The poor
I oftce slave who exposes his puttylike
body to strong sun and retires to his
- htel cot tired, blistered and home
Ssnk. probably hasn t done his nerves
Sa hundredth part of the harm that he
Smlnt have been able to buy in less
villhnt follies of midsummer mad
.unlight. consumed in large quanti
ties. is the least evil in this country.
