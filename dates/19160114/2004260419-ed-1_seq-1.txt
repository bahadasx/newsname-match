May.
Now Orleans Interests negotiate
for schooner to bo duplicate of City
of Portlund.
Four deepwatermen to be turned
out In the Columbia river during the
present year, with prospects that a
fifth can be constructed and probably
moro orders obtained, is the encour

to facilitate the building of a schoon
er for Captain W. Wrlghtson of Mo

nelt at St. Helens to look after the
work lu conjunction with Superin

Orders have been given for prelim
inary preparations on a third auxil
iary schooner for the Charles H.
McCormlck Lumber Company, to be
started as soon as the City of Port
land, the first of the fleet, is launched
next month. Tho second schooner Is
under way and It Is felt certain that
sho will be ready In May and the
third vessel in September or Octo
ber. So much attontlon has been ac
corded the City of Portland as about
tho best type of lumber carrier of the
character yet adopted, that a tele
gram was received yesterduy from
New Orleuns vessol owners, asking
for a price on turning out a dupli
cate vessel tilts year. Inquiries have
arrived from other ports for Informa
tion as to the vosfle!, but until recent
ly it had not been determined that
the corporation would undertake to
build ships for others.
Captain Wrighthon's sctioonor Is to
be a three-master, 165 feet long,
with a beam of 36 feet and depth of
hold of 12.6 feet, capable of carry
ing 600.000 root of Southern pine.
Tho vessel Is to be ready in June and
delivery will be made here, It being
expected that she will load full
cargo of Oregon Or on her maidon
voyago for tho Panama canal or
Cuba. She will b& equipped with a
semi-Diesel engine, driving a single
screw, so will be able to make time
In calms and head winds. Her owner
Intondn to use her In the trade be

there bolng a good demand for lum
ber with a remunerative return trade.
Pinna are bolng propared now, and It
is estimated her cost will be $60,000.
Portland and tho Columbia river
district Is making a new and strong
er Impression on lumbermen and
others having to do with the trans
portation of lumber, who are canting
about for vessels to engage- In the
1916 trade. The rush on at yard
where steel ships are turned out It
responsible In a measure, while on
the other hand, there are many own
ers who prefer wooden hulls for car
rying lumber and bulky cargo, such
as coal. Nowhere In the country It
timber accessible from which better
matorlal can be obtained than on the
Columbia, and success attained on
the Pacific Coast In the economical
and Bate operation of wooden steam
Bchoonors, followed by the compar
atively recent departure of the Mo
Cormlck interests In determining to
assemble a fleet of auxiliary schoon
ers for the lumber trade, Is bringing
tho woodon vessel Into Its own again.
Orders for the City of Portland
were placed July 1, but, owing to the
fact that Bpoclal care was exercised
In the selection of her hull material
and certain lengths were Instated on
for the keel, a little delay followed In
gotting thorn out. As soon as she
comes off the ways noxt month finish
ing work will be rushed, so she Is ex
ported to load lumber cargo for Aus
tralia about April 1. The second
vessol was ordored December 2, and
she Is to be commissioned in May,

THE WINTER OF 1916
BOREAS BLOWS SOME
A Reminder of the Winter of 1801-2
or 1881-2
"This reminds me of the winter of
1861-2 or 1881-2," said tho old In
habitant as he slid on the ice down
the hill on the bosom of his pants.
The fall of snow during the past ten
days totaled about nine inches. Tues
day morning the mercury registered
18 above, the coldest day of the
winter. In exposed localities water
pipes were frozen. Ice skating is
being indulged in and coasting by the
young people Is enjoyed to tho limit.
Sleighs and sleds, both . ancient
and modern, especially ancient, were
placed In commission and where the
regulation sleigh bells were not pro
curable, cow bells were substituted;
anything to make sleighing realistic.
It is so seldom that the snowfall Is
sufficient to afford this winter sport,
so every advantaga Is taken of the
occasion.
The Columbia river Is still open,
although floating Ice Is coming down
by the acre. Navigation, however,
is uninterrupted.
The mill shut down Thursday of
last week on account of snow, and did
not start up again until Monday
morning.
The shipyard also closed down on
account of snow and cold. The "air
guns" freeze as easy r.s potatoes.
Work was resumed on other parts of
the ship and yards Monday.
In the upper Willam-ite valley it
rained "pitch 'forks." so we are In
formed by private letter.
Southern Pacific trains are having
serious trouble in maintaining sched
ule time on account of the heavy
snowfall In the Siskiyous. The snow
Is five to seven feet in depth. With
the aid of snowplows and numerous
gangs of men, traffic Is bslng resum
ed. The present winter can be num
bered among the historic ones, not
only on the amount of snow, but the
length of time it remained on the
ground.
Later The weather continues to
ipe the real winter article. The snow
has been Increased and the ground
is covered to a depth of fourteen
inches. The snow Is dry and the
sleighing is fine. The mill has not
been running since Tuesday. The
shipyard is also shut down. Wed
nesday morning was the coldest re
corded this winter, 16 above zero.
Temperature Thursday morning was
several degrees lilgher. It is be
lieved that the storm period has
passed and milder weather is pre
dicted. Some trouble Is experienced on the
river on account of the Ice. The
Harvest Queen and the Lurllne are
laid off. The Iralda went up the
slough Thursday morning. For some
reason the slough will remain open
when the river is practically closed.
HIGH SCHOOL NOTES.
The examinations are on In full
swing now and from prospects there
are going to last till Saturday.
The S. II. H. S. boys went to de
teat when they met Clatskanle on
their floor last Saturday, by a score
of 26 to 15. The score may seem
somewhat lopsided but the game was
St. Helens' at the end of the first
half and was till about five minutes
before the last whistle blew, but
somehow or other we "blew up" and
C. H. S. rolled in enough baskets to
make the above score. The boys re
port a clean game and say Clatska
nle will be treated the same here, but
will have to scrap to win. The boys
had a good trip all together and the
hotel where they slept Saturday was
livened up somewhat, and a tew
doughnuts still in our room will re
mind the owner of a jolly bunch.
Tuesday our team went to Ridge-
field in the "Hoo Hoo," and took R
H. S. to a trimming of 18-16. It was
a fast game all the way through and
the score all through the last half
was tied, till one half a minute be
tore time was called. Duke Welling
ton shot the winning basket. Mr.
Sten reports his team as satisfactory
and that Saturday night in the Sun

MAY INVOKE RECALL
Taxpayers' League Taking Steps to
Recall Commissioners
Notwithstanding the inclemency
of the weather, there was a good at
tendance at the meeting of the Tax
payers' League Saturday.
The usual business was transacted
and officers elected for the ensuing
year.
The most important matter up for
consideration was the proposal to
Initiate a special election for the re
call of the present board of county
commissioners. It was stated that
the commissioners denied every
claim made by the league for the re
duction of county expenditures and
completely ignored the wishes and
demands of the Taxpayers' League.
The subject was discussed at con
siderable length and was finally left
to a committee of 12 to act as their
best judgment suggested. It was
also left with this committee whether
or not the county attorney should be
included in the recall. As we under
stand the actions of the league, ac
cording to the Information furnished
ub, the entire matter whether a re
call be Invoked or whether the county
attorney be included, rests entirely
with this committee.
POSTOFFICE RECEIPTS
The postofflce makes avery satis
factory showing for the quarter end

to $1104.09, and for the quarter
ending December 31, 1914, the total
receipts were $1251.66, an increase
of $147,67.
The stamp sales for December,
1914, were $351.77, and for the same

In the postal savings department,
the deposits decreased from $14,000
to $11,751. The number of deposits
decreased from 153 to 101.

sport will continue.
