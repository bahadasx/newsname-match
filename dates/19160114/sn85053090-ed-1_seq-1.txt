I used to pay the grocer 's bill

promptly threw. But now in vain
they plead and moan, to get my

lar that I own I need for gasoline.

I clothes, they held their heads up

scene; for every coin I get must
j go to buy some gasoline. I usee! j
I to often blow a plunk at charity's,
| behest, to give some wanderer a
| bunk wherein his bones might
I rest. Oi- furnish breakfast for
-ome bo, road weary, starved and
lean: but now my dollars all must 1
go to purchase gasoline. I used
to talk of bocks and art., and top- i
ics safe and sane, but I've bought!
that choo-choo cart I cannot even
spare a dime to buy a magazine: j
it keeps me hustling all the time!
to buy my gasoline. —Walt Mas

TO BUILD MILL SOOS
Is Decision of Ekalaka Milling
Company Stockholders i
The stockholders of the Eka
laka Milling company met Mon
day afternoon in-the Fire Halltj
and much important business'
was transacted. Nearly all the •
stock was represented in person.
The last Tuesday in June of
each year was 'selected as the
date of the annual meeting and
a board of directors was elccted
to serve until the next annual
meeting, as follows: W. H, Pock,
L. R. Rolfe, Geo. Boggs, DeLess
Hall and S. A. Holt. The new
ly elected board went into ses
sion immediately and are' still
busy auditing bids, searching
the records and otherwise ac
quainting themselves with the
business of the company.
One of the important ques
tions discussed by the stockhold
ers was the erection of a mill
building. It seemed to be the '
consensus of opinion that the
construction of a mill and the'
purchase of machinery be gone
ahead with as soon as possible.
A motion prevabed that the
board of directors be empowered
to let contracts for this work and
arrange the financial details.
They have under consideration a
proposal for the building- of a
mill which ca'ds for the comple
tion of the work by M:irch 15ih.
The board has ordered a 15
horse Fairbanks engine to re
place the one purchased for the
elevator and which has proven
unsatisfactory.
Inasmuch as the elevator
been completed under snmewhat;
adverse conditions and the out
going board of directors and
those who have been most instru
mental in boosting this proposi
tion along have been laboring
under many disadvantages, it is
remarkable what progress has
been made in getting the com
pany into an operating condition.
If the same unselfish spirit pre- -
vails among those who have al
lied themselves with this under
taking it is saivi to prophesy that,
the Ekalaka Milling company
will soon have completed i:.s con
struction and equipment and will
rapidly progress toward t h e
sound and paying business that
it is sure to be eventually.
Portland,Ore.— Albert Ilailien,
85, wided the disposition of $250
and died. Only ;?2i0 could be
found, until it was discovered he
had swallowed a ten dollar gold
piece while delirious. The money,
was taken from his stomach and
disposed of according to his will.
