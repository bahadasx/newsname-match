Drastic Investigation is in progress
today by Hawaiian Department head
quarters of the soldier riot In the Iwl
lei district last night
Conflicting; reports from various of
ficers and commands as to the soldiers
involved In the wrecking of the houses
in the red light" section came today.
Following thick and fast upon the
melee which broke out shortly after 7
o'clock last night, are denials from
-both 9th Cavalry and 25th Infantry of
ficers that many of their men were
in the mob which broke Into houses,
smashed the contents, terrorized the
rain ted w omen and generally ran
amuck. : .
Several Independent Inquiries are
in progress, the results of which will
be officially reported to army heid-
quarters jand then the army staff 'will
rearhtheir conclusions with all the
facts before them.
Te facts that have reached army
headquarters SO far show that the
trouble really started early yesterday
afternoon. A number of soldiers of
the lUh cavalry, a colored organiza
tion, here with the transport Sberl
. dan. and the 25th Infantry, the colored
regiment from Schofleld. met at the
social entertainment given by the 25th
1viJ s Ti Jt lug ; oomxa eaAU4 -.
'tional tJUard armory. It. is held that
both near or at the armory and in
saloons of Honolulu the soldiers con
sumed more booze than was good for
them, and that this was the original
cause of trouble.
From that to the iwliei visit at
1 nightfall. th$ refusal of most of the
women to harbor the soldiers, and the
sudden outbreak of deKtructivpness,
was a series of quick steps.
Rigid Investigation Ordered.
" The following statement was made
at army headquarters at noon today:
A thorough and comprehensive in
vestigation of all the facts surround
ing the outbreak at Iwilei last night
has been ordered. Department Head
quarters have as yet had no official
reports. - The commanding officer on
the transport. Col. Harry S. Hale; Ma
jor I.enihan. who commanded the Fort
Shatter- battalion that furnished the
increased provost guard last night,
and the authorities at Schofleld Har
racks have been ordered to assemble
and report all facts concerning the
matter. - I
No Martial Law. '
"No martial law was declared last
ttfcht ' The 2nd Infantry, which pro
vides the regular provost guard, was
called on to send an increased guard
and responded with four companies.
"The soldier riot was due to the en
tertaining of the 9th Cavalry ty the
25th Infantry and to the rough men
who at that time became aroused with
drink. The outbreak was confined to
the 9th cavalrymen and 23th infantry
men, and the trouble wa confined to
the. red-light district There was no
disorder outside, this district, so far
as reported."
It is understood that officers of-the
Pth cavalry say that their own pro
vost guard was able to restore order
in Iwilei and that this guard had
cleared the district and gone back to
the ship before the 2nd infantry ap
peared in response to the hurry call
by the police when the police found
the situation bej'ond civil authority.
Good Work by 2nd Infantry.
Unofficially, army men give credit
to the battalion of the 2nd Infantry
, and its officers for a clean-cut and,
capable piece of n-ork in checking the
disorder and patrolling the district
While no martial law was declared
and none even suggested, the district
under the patrol of the 2nd Infantry
last night was virtually under mill-'
tary rule akin to martial law. The
police turned the job of handling the
riot over to i the. soldiers entirely, the
soldiers formed lines around the dis
trict with bayonets ready for service
if necessary, and military passes were
requisite to get civilians into the pa
trolled region. Civilians already there
were ordered to leave and the women
told to close up their houses.
That the situation almost Instantly
cot beyond the police and that Dep
uty Sheriff Asch acted correctly in es
timating the extent of the trouble and
calling on Shafter for the increased
provost guard Is the consensus of
opinion so far heard this morning.

General Agent Coming From

Committee Hears
TRANSPORTATION MEN
SEE BUSINESS GROWING
Hawaii's growing tourist traffic and
Importance as a travelling center is
attracting widespread attention among
railroad men, and as a result, a strong
rumor is current that the Atchison.
Topeka & Santa Fe system will short
ly open an office in this city, with
perhaps a branch at Hilo.
The report is based partly on what
transportation men have heard of the
Santa Fe's apparent intention, and
partly on an inquiry which the Hawaii
Promotion Committee has received
from a Santa Fe man. H. F. Vernon,
the general agent of the Santa Fe at
Portland, has written that he is com
ing here with his wife . and . three
daughters and desires to secure quar
ters. His letter indicates that he is
coming not for a brief visit but as a
resident. ' ' f'...
It is conjectured that Vernon wiil
be the Santa Fe agent here. DaVies
& Company are now the freight agents
In Hawaii for the big Santa Fe 'sys
tem. Transportation men believe that
there is so much passenger travel in
sight for the territory during the jnext
few years that several railroads are
likely to be in the hunt for business.
"The more the merrier," said one
man this morning. 'The compet tJon
will benefit all the roads for It ivlll
lead to increased advertising and de
velop tne passenger business far. more
than if one or two roads had all of It"

That there should be some sort of
organized effort to boost the shipping
industry between China and the Uni
ted States was one of the facts brought
out by Thomas Sammons, consul-general
at Shanghai, in his talk to the
Commercial Club, his host, this after
noon, i .
Consul Sammons declared that "in
trade possibilities the potential power
of China to be developed in future
years can hardly be measured. While
at present she furnishes in all a trade
of only a few million dollars, he said,
it is entirely possible that a few years
will bring forth trade equal to $6 a
head for her enormous population.
'Mr. Sammons told the club of the
workings of a newly organized busi
nessmen's club in Shanghai fashioned
much on the same lines as the local
Commercial Club.
He said that there has also been
organized recently an American Cham
ber of Commerce in tne big uninese
dtv. which clans in a short time to
became affiliated in a manner, at least.
with the same movement in the unit
ed States.
Recalla Former Visits.
Mr. Sammons was introduced by Al
bert Waterhouse, president or tne
rviniirureial Club, and preceded his
business talk with a number of anec
dotes regarding previous experiences
he had enjoyed in Hawaii.
One of his most laughable stories
was of a time when he was sick in
the Queen's hospital with typhoid fe
ver. Ringing his electric Dew mree
times to call the nurse, he called in
stead two Hawaiian boys who stared
at him curiously, whispering to them
selves the while.
"Finally growing tired of their ac
tions I made a face at them.' said the
eonsuL "and they took to their heels
in a panic, one of them crashing into
a window at the end or tne nan way.
The consul explained that he
learned afterward he had given the
wrong signal, and instead of ringing
for the nurse had really called tne
boys who were detailed to carry out
people who died.
Consul Sammons proved himself to
be a genial entertainer with his f"nd
of stories, and kept his hearers laugh
ing most of the time.
Anions those tt the table with the
guest were Governor Pinkham, May
or Lane. Brig.-gen. Samuel Johnson,
Dr. C. B. Cooper and President l'a
