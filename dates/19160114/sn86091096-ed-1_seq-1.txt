HOW DOES THE FOLLOWING
STRICK YOU
It has been suggested to us by a
prominent farmer of the Potlatch
country that the road districts sur
rounding the city of Kendrick be
created into one road district and
that one supervisor be placed in
charge who knows how to make
roads. This thing of doing a little
patching here and there is money
thrown away and in the end you
have nothing. It is good roads that
make the value of any mans ranch
and without them the value decreases
year bv year. There is no better
place in the world to build good
roads than in this famous Potlatch
country. The raw material is at
our hands if we will only make use
of it. Think this matter over and
if any good Farmer or Business man
has any views on the matter the col
umns of the Gazette are open to you
free of charge to discuss the matter.

Special Meeting of
The Chamber of
Commerce
At Guy Hotel To-Night
Tuesday evening the Chamber of
Commerce held its regular meeting,
on jy a f ew 0 f tj, e faithful was pre
«.„t. Road ma tters were the main
topic of the evening. It waslearn
ed that the city has made promises
as t0 what {t will do in ^e way of
making perminent improvements on
the streets of this little city and
another report was received in re
gard to what will be dene on the
road from Wauncher gulch bridge
to the Bear creek bridge. The rock
crusher will be shipped to Kendrick
in a few days so that the work can
commence as soon as the roads thaw
in the spring. Now good citizens
of Kendrick and surrounding coun
try it is impossible for a few men
to do all that is to be done in the
way of road work in this section
and the only way to get it done is
for more who are interested to come
out and help make a go of it. You
cannot expect a few to do all the
work. We have a club with a mem
bership of over thirty members and
at the meeting four or five came
out and the rest are willing that
they should do the work, it is not
right and you are the loosers. A
call meeting will be held at the
Hotel Guy this Friday evening and
every man in this vicinity that is
interested in road building is re
quested to be present. Supper will
be served at 7:00 o'clock after
which the meeting will be held.
Arrangements are tobe made which
will start the log moving in the
road work of this vicinity.
Perfect Appeal
Transcript Is Filed
Lewiston, Jan. 12.—An appeal to
the supreme court has been perfect
ed in the case of H. M. Fluharty,
respondent, vs. Board of County
Commissioners of Nez Perce county
et al, appelants, the transcript,
having been filed in the office of the
supreme court here Tuesday morn
ing. The first session of the su
preme court to be held in Lewiston
will be on May 31, when it is sup
posed the case will be tried.
Announcement of the taking of
an appeal by the commissioners was
given sometime ago, too late to be
argued at the fall term of court,
and the transcript of the case was
prepared at leisure and is now just
filed.
The case is regarded as one of
considerable importance and has to
do with the validity of the appro
priation made last summer by the
commis ioners in aid of the North
west Livestock association. Thru
very numerously signed petitions
the county commissioners were im
portuned to make an appropriation
for the benefit of the aisociation.
After careful investigation of the
matter and being fully convinced
that the association was of material
benefit to the community at large,
the commissioners voted the sum of
$2500 for its benefit and to assist in
financing the stock show held here
last month.
H. M. Fluharty, a farmer of the
Culdesac neighborhood, who is the
respondent in the case just appealed
began suit in the district court to
enjoin the commissioners and the
county anditor from drawing a war
ront for the appropriation
Judge Steele after hearing argu -1
ment in the case decided that the
commissioners had exceeded their
authority in making the appropria- j
tion, based his decision on former !
decisions by the court. It is this de- .
cision that is now being appealed i
from.
After the adverce decision had
been rendered and before appeal
could be perfected, acting under the
spur of necessity, the people of Lew
iston secured through subscriptions
the momey to finance the show which
was held with great success.
The decision ol the supreme court
will be awaited with great interest.

N. P. Will Bring Up Ken

Moscow, Jan. 12.—That the
Northern Pacific tax department
will contest the payment of the
special school levies affecting the
the schools of Kendrick and Julia
etta developed today when Prosecut
ing Attorney F. L. Moore received
a telegram from the tax attorney
that the issues on the protest would
be brought before Judge Steele in
the district court at Lewiston next
Monday morning. It is understood
that similar suits have been filed
against school districts in Nez Perce
county.
In connection with the protest,
County Attorney Moore has advised
the Latah county board by letter of
the action by the railway company.
His letter in part follows:
"I would advise you to instruct
the county treasurer to not appor
tion the money paid in by the rail
way company in payment of this
special tax in excess of five mills
to either district until there can be
some disposition of the case. I
would also advise that you at once
drick and Juliaetta districts that
the company is making a claim for
their excess."
Mr. Moore has advised the com
missioners that the levy in the Ken
drick* district in excess of five mills
was without authority of law as the
act providing for more than a five
mill levy did not go into effect un
til May 8th, while the district made
its levy in April. In the Juliaetta
! district it is regarded as all right,
though a close
involved.

A Tale of Two Rails
Of the more than one billion pas
sengers carried annually on Ameri
can railways, not one, perhaps, in a
thousand, has an opportunity of per
using the pages of the annual report
of a railway company. To many,
auch a report with its many statist
ical tables and its brief and more or
less matter of fact statements, would
prove somewhat dry reading. But
there is, actually, a large amount of
interesting matter in such a report.
Let us for example, study the re
port of a large railway company—
the Northern Pacific, for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1915.
The income received from the
mechanical operation of the road
was $63,000,000 and the correspond
ing operating expense was $37,000,
000. The cost of operations plus
the taxes on the property equalled
almost 66 per cent of the entire op
! eratin S ,ncome - ™ a t is afapt worth
; remembering. A few Rems of ex
! ^ ndlture showin * how the bulk of

of interest.
Road maintenance, including
track laying, surfacing, etc., cost
$3,767,000; replacing old rails cost
$262,000; new ties, $1,700,000; bal-
lasts renewals cost $126,000; theex
penditures for bridge repains, etc.,
was $609,000. Along another line,
locomotive repairs amounted to $2,
1 275,000 ; repairs to freight cars cost
i $2,862,000, and those to passenger
cars,$816,000. Labor received near

gated more than $5,000,000 in cost,
Labor and engine feul alone con-
sumed 70 percent approximately,
the total operating expenditures.
Such an enumeration as this shows
how wonderfully a railway enters
into the life of every community a-
long its line. The track crews, the
