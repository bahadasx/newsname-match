DOUGLAS, Ariz., Jan. 13. Disquieting reports concering the estab
lishment of the de factor government in Sonora, Mexico, were brought
here tonight by arrivals from Nogales, Sonora.
Misunderstandings between General P. Elias Calles. military gov
ernor of Sonora, and Major General M. M. Dieguez, in command of the
contingent operating against the Yaqui Indians, were said to have aris
en and to have reached such a stage that a break in the relations be
tween these two officials was threatened.
Troops under General Francisco Urbalejo, the Yaqui chieftain, and
Jose Trujillo, a former Villa leader, which now form a part of general
Dieguez's forces, were said to be discontented over the alleged depreci
ation in Carranza money, with which they were being paid. This it was
stated was the chief disturbing factor among the soldiers.
Ives G. Lelevier, Mexican consul here, announced that General Van
ustiano Carranza, head of the de facto Mexican government, today or
dered all available troops from Cananea and Nogales, Sonora, to Juarez
to take the field against General Francisco Villa and his followers.
It was not known whether the troops Were to march overland or
whether the Mexican authorities would apply to the state department at
Washington for permission to transport them through American territory.

EL PASO, Jan. 13. General Vic- I
toriano Huerta, former provisional ;
president of Mexico, died at his home
here at 8:35 o'clock tonight. i
General Huerta, who succeeded j
General Francisco I. Madero, in ex- j
ecutivo power in Mexico City, and j
later left Mexico, died of sclerosis of i
the liver. His death was not unex- j
pected. Funeral arrangements are to
be made tomorrow, it was announced
at hie residence tonight. It is be
lieved n effort will be made to ar
range his burial in Mexico.
General Victoriano Huerta was a
professional soldier, and as such he had
up to the overthrow of President Fran
cisco Madero, been known for his loyal
support of the existing governments
He fought loyally for 'resident Corfiro
Dian until his fall, and when Diaz was
no longer chief executive, Huerta
fought for Francisco de la l'.arra, the
provisional president. After Francisco
Madero was 'elected Huerla found it
to be his duty to s'lipport one who had
so long fought as it rebel. His loyalty
was not challenged antil the Felix Diaz
revolution in Mexico-City in -February. I
l'.H3, when the Madero government j
was completely overthrown and Huerta
himself elevated, to the presidency.
Huerta devoted himself to the mil- ,
itary career at a very early age. liorn j
at Chihuahua in JXi.4, lie eniereu ioe
military academy of Chnpultepec at the
age of 17, and passed through the full
course to graduation in tS.a, when he
was commissioned second lieutenant of
engineers. During his academic term I
he was known for his predelietion for
scientific studies, particularly astron
omy and mathematics.
When I'orfirio Diaz began his re
organization of the Mexican army
Huerta was promoted to captain of
, engineers and while holding this rank
devised the plan for a Mexican general
staff corps. He was an active member
of the military map commission created
to draft a staff map of Mexico on 'a
large scale, and he had charge of all
the astronomical work of the commis
sion's leading exploring and surveying
parties over the wildest regions of the
republic. .
During the ensuing years Huerta saw
much active service. In V.'Ol he left
the staff and took command of the in
fantry in the campaign against the
. Yacpii Indians. After this campaign he
was again put in charge of the general
staff's topographical work in Sonora.
