various olabs in the Hills are to meet
here on Saturday eveniug the anuaal
banquet was postponed and the north
ern-Hills men will be guests of the lo
oal olab on tomorrow evening at the

As the several reports of the oommit.
tees woald no doubt be too lengthy for
pafetiwtioo at thistime, the report of
the president, Mr. Daftioutyn, is here
with given as he covers the ground
very thoroughly and name* the work
done by the various oommittees. This
report given below should prove inter
eating reading to every oitizen of Hot
Springs.
"To the Stockholders and Director*
of the Hot Springs Oommeroial Olub:
In olosing the ttsoal year I should
like to make a brief review of the year's
work and mention some of. the things
aooompliEhed and some of the things
not accomplished
It is hardly needfal to say or repeat
that this year has beeu auusual, par
ticularly from a business standpoint..
And perhaps Hoc Spriugs has felt, this
year, more than its share of trade de
pression, although ii WvuUt feetn nat
ural that the advantageous Reason fcr
the farmers'and^lairy men must have
aooelerated trade at least in some
lines. Oa the other hand the unusual
rainfall proved disasterous to roads
and to the auto-tonrisc trade for Hoi
Springs. Also the Panama-Pacific Ex
position at San F- a.icuoo and the Cal
ifornia-Panama •_.%
were the meaah'
r-*s.1r. ou bmDiyn
^Ivc^tiLiu
ur.itih
the tourist trcds that &iiuuld hav»
visited Hot 8pri .tis.
In the face of luese binderanoes Hot
Springs has held its own, and I wish to
take this opportunity to thank the
oitizens of the oity for their support of
the Oommeroial Club daring the year.
It is of course to be regretted that
there are those of our business men
who refrain from supporting the Club
bat the presentage is small. Were
their namber larger we might ask the
question, is the Oommeroial Olab all
wrong and'of no benefit to the town?
However in answer we need only point
to the reports of onr various commit
tees as evidenoe of activities whioh
ooant for a betjter community, hence
the man who withholds his support
reaps the fruit earned by the unselfish
labor and the hard earned money con
tributed by the others. Along this
line I would ilk* to express my opinion
ot
10 v~ v*. *, rir^v
that a member has not fulfilled his
whole duty when he has paid to the
Seoretary his dues or subscription or
performed some duty alloted him by
the direotors as a oommitten, for what
ia more discouraging to the offloers and
the direotors than the absence of the
members. Indeed it is soon reflected
in the disposition of the direotors to
avoid the meetings and soon we would
have no meetings at all, but I am glad
to say that we have had some well at
tended and enthusiastic meetings dur
ing the year, and in addition to mv
gratitude for the financial support
rnxmbfrs and subscribe™ I wish to
thank the members and Direotors for
their attendanoe at the meetings. I
have felt the boon of loyal support
throughout the year both from the
direotors and from the members. There
has been so far as 1 know no dissen*
tion in the Ulub and the majority of
those ml led on the various oommitteeB
have labored oommendably. First
among our oommittees was an efllo
lent.Budget committee upon whose suo
cess rested the possibilities of the re
mainder of the oommittees and the
olob for most of the oommittees had
need of money for their work. So suc
cessful was the work of the Budget
oommittee that over $2300 was raised.
It was thought best by your Board
of direotors at, the beginning of the
year that $1000 should be set a6ide for
the publicity aud advertising oommit
tee. This oommittee did splendid and
active work whioh is toaohed upon in
detail in a report from the oommittee
and whioh oannot help but bring last
ing benefits to Hot Springs. It spent
directly much less than the $1000 al
loted them. However during the year
numerous small items were passed
upon by the direotors themselves
whioh seemed to bear the nature of
publioity and were charged ap to that
aooount so that in all the Secretary's
report will show nearly $1000 spent
for advertising and publioity.
Another important oommittee has
been that on good roads as mnoy of you
will testify who hud the opportunity
of using the windoave aud otber roads
this summer. While iu Chicago re
cently officials of the Chioago and
Northwestern R'y complimented, in
my presenoe, Hot Springs highly on its
good
roadB
and our Good Roads Com­
mittee deserves the oredit. Their re
port will show you how much oan be
be done with a small amount of money
expended judioioasly thru the Com
mercial Olub. Only about $200 was
spent be the good roads oommittee.
Uur CJivio Improvement Oommittee
was started a little later in the year at
the request of members ot the Olub.
This oommittee with a little over $100
put our golf Qourse in good shape and
were instrumental in bringing other
improvements about town whioh would
have, continued undone. The Com
mitee was muoh hindered byttte uff^
usual rainfall causing
growth of
a
grasB
,, ,,
rf
pheuomiual
and weeds over the
whole golf oourse and all over town
which for laok of preparedness oould
not be ooped with. The Oommittee in
its repurt makes reoommendations
whioh should have the prompt at
tention of the olub for the coming
year's activities.
We have been fortunate iu having an
able entertainment oommittee whioh
has provided attractive bauqaeta end
other eufcertaiunient for the local pec
pl» and visitors.
Anrl our irrigation committee hos
been active in o-..Lim.otion with toe

be tbo moans

new wealta tu Hot Springs and its sur
rounding territory. We oannot lay to
much stress on the need of putting
fourth every effort possible the oom
ing year to hasten irrigation for our
community.
The committer un agriculture has an

done at the State Fair if the matter is
properly handled. The oon6trnotion
o* silcs in our oommunity should re
oeive strong support from our Com
mercial Olub.
Our seoretary deserves honorable
mention for bis anoeasing and untiring
toil in behalf of the Club and for bis
success in raising niouey iu the way
outlined by the Budget oommittee, al
ways exoelling in courtesy and geni
ality.
Your President wishes to express his
personal gratitude and thanks to the

so ably assisted and filled the vaoanoy

ATTRACTING
CONDUCTED BY REV. HEAD
GEORGIA EVANGELIST AROUSING VERY
MUCH ENTHUSIASM AT HIS
MEETINGS
The evangelistic services at the
Baptist ohuroh are attracting large
orowds,
Sunday afternoon and evening the
house was crowded and the Baptist
ohuroh has fehe largest auditorium in
the oity. Even the steps to the pulpit
were tilled, ohairs were brought in from
neighboring houses and people were
standing in the aisles and about the
door.
It is snre an old-time revlva'. Mr.
Head, while a Baptist has all of the
mannerisms of the old time shouting
Methodist.
Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians,
and Cnristians, seem to be trying to
outdo eaoh other in adding to the en
thusiasm and in shoutingA,Amen."
The Rodebeaver song books are full
of enlivening selections, old and new,
that have been popularized by Billy
Sunday, and everybody is eDjoying the
•inging. The "Happy Song" by the
ohildren is making a great hit.
Although it was very cold on Mon
day evening, the house was well tilled
to hear Mr. Head's great, sermon on
"Our Women" and no one was dissa
pointed. He is a great orator. The
audience was moved from laughter to
tears and from tears to laughter and
then to serious t.hot, and from serious
thot to prayers. It was a great night.
On Tuesday evening the thermom
eter dropped so low that it was feared
that nobody oould get out, but in spite
of the oold there was a very good at
tendanoe. However, Mr. Head deoid&d
that it would be best to give all of the
people a ohanoe to hear bis great
serips of sermons as announced laet
week, and so be will preach on Sunday
afternoon at 2:30 on "Heaven." Sunday
evening the subjeot will be "A Man's
Darling Sin." and on Monday evening
"A'Man's Back-bone." Other subjects
will be announced at these meetings.
A splendid spirit of fellowship on
the part of the churches prevails and
on last Sunday evening all of the
ohurohes dismissed their regular ser
vi??R£o join in the evangellfyjo servloe
of the evening.
A great man is among us and every
citizen of Hot Springs should hear him
Servioes every night but Saturday.
