BRIDGE BONDS VOTED
Taxpayers of Navajo County Vote
in Favor of a $63,000 Bond
Issue tor Bridge Building
Purposes
Last Tuesday at the special
election held for that purpose,
the tax payers of Navajo County
voted in favor of issuing bonds
to the amount of $63,000 for the
purpose of building- a number of
bridges in the county. While the
vote in nearly all the precincts
was light, owing to the incle
ment weather, a good majority
in favor of the proposition was
polled. Only 615 taxpavers voted
in the 15 precincts; of this num
ber 485 voted for the bonds and
170 against, the majority in favor
being 315. i
Unofficial returns received bv
the local telephone office, and

The majority returned in favor
of the bonds is cause for gratifi
cation among those whoendorsed
the proposition and worked for
its fulfillment. Some opposition
to the bond issue had developed
in some sections of the county,
but it was local in character and
those who fostered it had
but
little following.
The vote in Winslow, St. Joe,
Woodruff, Snowflake and Hol
brook was largely for the bonds,
and the majorities rolled up in
these precincts easily overcame
the majorities cast against them
in some of the smaller precincts.
- The News believes that the
people voted right on this occa
sion. In fact, the people usually
vote right on every proposition,
political or other, and it is always
safe to pass the decision of any
question up to the electorate, es
pecially where the standard of
intelligence is so high as it is in
Navajo countv.

So The People May Know
In order that the people of the
county may know the truth about
the award of the countv publish
ing contract to the proprietor of
The Holbrook News, last week,
and may not be misled ' by
the misinformation published
the Winslow Mail, the facts
in
are
stated herewith.
The advertisement for bids for
publishing did not specify per
column inch, as the Mail alleges
Mr. Chapman, evidently assum
ed tnat single column inch was
meant, for in submitting his bid
he specified a price of "15 cents
for single column inch" for pub
lishing the proceedings of the
board. Mr. Smith s bid was for
12h cents "per single column
incn. Mr. craxton s Did was
for "25 cents per inch". He as
sumed that the advertisement
for bids meant double column
inch, since the law specifies that
the proceedings of the board of
supervisors must be published in
double column measure,
In other words, each of the
three men bidding for the con
tract construed the meaning of
the advertisement to suit him
self. Mr. Smith and Mr. Chap
odan placed the same construc
tion on the language; Mr. Brax
ton placed a different construc
tion on it. The supervisors con
strued Mr. Braxton's language
to mean the same thing that Mr.
Braxton intended it to mean, ie.,
25 cents per double column inch,
or 12A cents for single column
inch.
At this figure Mr. Braxton's
bid was tha same as Mr. Smith's
bid. and was 2 cent per inch
lower than Mr. ChaDman's. Mr.
Smith's bid on other publishing
was higher than Mr. Braxton's.
It was also higher than Mr. Chap-
cents per inch lower on this class
of publishing than Mr. Braxton's,
but as the publishing of the pro
ceedings of the board constitutes
by far the greater volume of the
work, and as Mr. Braxton's price
was 2 cents lower than Mr.
Chapman s, the board decided
that, considered as a whole, Mr.
Braxton s bid was the best. The
contract was therefore awarded
to Mr. Braxton, and it was a-
warded legally, the allegations of
the editor of the Mail to the con-
tary notwithstanding.
ine loregoing statement is
published in order that the charge
of performing illegal acts made
by the Mail against the super
visors may be refuted. The
supervisors not only acted within
their rights, and legally, but held
faith with their constituents
the taxpayers and accepted the
lowest and best bid for the pub
lishing contract. If at the same
time the contract went to a friend
all the better.
As to the charge made by the
Mail against a former manage
ment of The Holbrook News, that
this management entered into
collusion with the management
of the Mail to put the board of
supervisors "over a barrel", and
compel the board to let the con
tract to The News at its price,
we know nothing. We were not
in Arizona at that time and we
are not given to delving in anci
ent history. But we doibt the
statement that The News man
agement paid the Mail manage
ment $140 to stay out of the
building.
We have no reason to suppose
that the Mail's information in
this instance came from a source
any more reliable than it secures
much of its other mis-informa
tion. Wrong in many of its sur
mises and conclusions, it is pro
bably wrong in this.

Blacksmith Adds New Equipment
W. Warren, Holbrook 's enter
prising blacksmith and wheel-
right, has just added two new
pieces of machinery to his plant,
which he finds to be a great con
venience in some lines of work.
One machine is a handoower
shears; the other is a handpower
punch. With the shears pieces
of steel nearly an inch in thick
ness can be cut easily; while with
the punch, holes of different sizes
can be punched in steel f of an
inch thick. The two machines
are the latest patterns of that
kind of tools and Mr. Warren has
been using them daily since he
put them in his shop. He finds
them especially useful in making
steel trough straps, and these he
can make more rapidly and at
less cost than the old method.
A new time-card went into
effect on the Santa Fe Sunday
morning. Only a few slight
changes in the arrival of trains
at Holbrook are made. East
bound train No. 22 arrives at
4:20 p. m., three minutes earlier
than formerly. The de luxe train
is reinstated, and runs once a
week between Chicago and the
coast. It passes through Hol
brook westbound every Thurs
day at 2:40 p. m. ; eastbound at

Cole will probably hold services

is cordially invited.
California Motor Oil
One thing the Exposition has
done for California petroleum, it
is said, has been the correction
of the mistaken theory that good
motor oil couldn't be made from
asphalt-base crude.
A representative of one of the
big California refiners says that
ever since the awards of the Ex
position juries have been given
wide publicity, motorists and
dealers who couldn't see any
thing but Eastern oil, are com
ing around to using and advocat
ing oil made from California pet
roleum. "Paraffine base oil was the
first motor oil developed" says
this refinery representative, "and
even after Western oil had been
developed and proved, the old
tradition concerning paraffine
base oil still clung, encouraged
no doubt by the refiners of these
oils".
"And, by the way, not only
the Exposition juries, but gas
engine authorities are now en
dorsing asphaltbase motor oils."
New Law Partnership
A partnership for the practice
of law has been formed by Sena
tor Isaac Barth and Senator
Thomas J. Mabry, Mr. Barth's
confrere in the state legislature.
The firm is to be known as Barth
and Mabry, Mr. Mabry was
formerly editor of the Clovis, N.
M., Journal and studied law
while editing the paper. He was
admitted to the state bar several
vears ago, before his election to
the senate from Curry county.
Mr. Mabrv is now in Texas settl
ing several cases and is expected
to arrive here about January 15.

Railroad Tie Spacer Patented
J. W. Wood, inspector of brid
ges and buildings of the Arizona
divison of the Santa Fe railroad,
has invented an instrument for
the spacing of ties that is sure
to be of important commercial
value. With the instrument one
man can do the work of several
and in a way that makes the lay
ing and spacing of the ties en
tirely automatic. The Santa Fe
is having a large number of the
instruments made for use on all
sections of its coast lines. This
invention should bring Mr. Wood
considerable revenue. Kingman

The Habit of Taking Cold
With many people taking cold
is a habit, but fortunately one
that is easily broken. Take a
cold sponge bath every morning
when you first get out of bed-
not ice cold, but a temperature
of about 90o F. Also sleep with
your window up. Do this and
you will seldom take cold. When
,you do take cold take Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy and get
rid of it as quickly as possible.
Obtainable everywhere.
