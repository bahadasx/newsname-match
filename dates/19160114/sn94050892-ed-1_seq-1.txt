Mine Managers in El Paso Notified
of Action of Employees By Wire
Statement From Managers Under
Date of January' 8th Circulated In
District.
MEN EXPECTING SETTLEMENT
Send Guarantee to Managers of . Pro
tction and No Disorder If They
See Fit to Return to District For
Conference.
At the expiration of four long
months of industrial inactivity, as
the result of a strike called by the
Western Federation of Miners, on
September 11th, 1915, the employees
ot the three large mining companies
in this district on Monday and Tues
day of this week, - in mass meetings
'assembled at Metcalf, Morenci and
Clifton, renounced their allegiance to
the Western Federation of Miners,
threw away their union cards, and in
th presence of witnesses turned over
the three union charters in this or
ganization to Sheriff James G. Cash,
-who in turn expressed them together
with, the union seals to Earnest Mills,
Secretary of Western Federation of
Miners, at Denver, Colorado. , The
charters and seals left Clifton for
Denver on Wednesday morning.
Simultaneous with this action
Messrs. Norman Carmichael, J. W.
Bennie, and Milton McLean, managers
of the three large produciag copper
companies in the district, were noti
fied hv the sheriff. ...and member-? of
the Citizen's League of the action ot
their former employees regarding the
Western Federation of Miners.
Following the renunciation of the
Western Federation of . Miners by
the former employees of the mining,
companies, . by a unanmous vote of
those present, the employees' swore
allegiance to the Arizona State Fed
eration of Labor and listened to an
address by John J. Donnelly, of Mi
ami, Vice-President of that organiza
tion, which is composed of various
trades, unions throughout the. state.
It is understood that the employees
in the district will perfect a local
organization in Metcalf, Morenci and
Clifton and will affiliate with the
State Federation of Labor and through
the state organization become affili
ated with the American Federation of
Labor'of which, President Gompers
is" leader.
It is reported in Clifton that the ac
tion taken by the miners and smelter
men ' in ' tne Clifton-Morenci district,
renouncing allegiance to the Western
Federation of Miners, will be follow
ed by similar action by miners' and
smeltermen in other mining camps
in the state.
Criticism of the action taken . by
the officials and members of the exe
cutive committee of the Western Fed
ration of Miners in the inauguration
and conduct of the strike in the Clifton-Morenci
district, can be heard
from several quarters. " It is charged
that Western Federation officials in
' augurated the strike without proper
authority and that no adequate provis
ion was made for financing the same.
It Is a well known fact that the
strikers have ben sorely in need of
funds for sustenance for several
- weeks and that the Western Federa
tion aid, through the Denver office
lias been practically nil.
By renouncing the Western Federa
tion of Miners it does not necessarily
follow that the employees are willing
to return to work at the old scale of
wages. In fact no such thought is
being entertained. Smarting under
the treatment they have received at
the b?ods cf the Western Federation
officials and recognizing the wall
iiujwn antipathy of the mine mana
gers to this organization, the employ
ees iave taken the present course in
the hope that with the Western
Federation feature eliminated, once
and for all, the mine managers will
now be willing to return to the dis
trict and treat with their employees
through selected committees for that
. purpose.
'During the past two days represen
tations have been made to the mine
managers at El Paso guaranteeing
them protection from any form of
violence in the event they return to
the district for the purpose of a con
ference. Whether such a conference,
regarding wages and other grievances
would lead to a settlement of the
present disagreement is of course
problematical but a feeling of opti
mism prevails that such a conference
on the part of the managers with their
employees, under the new conditions
which prevail, will bring . about a
satisfactory settlement.
Donnely Makes Speech
On the Library Plaza in Clifton on
Tuesday afternoon, John J. Donelly,
speaking to a mass meeting of em-

.
nloyees. composed of approximately
a thousand men, said the workingmen
of this district should be proud of
their efforts, extending over four long
months, for the principle of organiza-
tion. Mr. Donelly stated that this .stored, ana a new sliding scale in
was the vital principle at stake the this district adopted which will ap
rieht of workinemen to sell their la- ': proach the scale paid for similar
bor collectively, a right guaranteed
to "them under the constitution of
their country.
Commenting upon the renunciation
of the Western Federation of Miners,
which action had been taken by the
mass meeting a few minutes earlier,
the speaker told the men that by
their action they were adjusting
themselves to a condition which
probably would bring about a settle
ment. The speaker called attention to the
interests of the public at large and
the loss experienced by them in, the
present controversy as well as the
employer and employes. Citing the
fact that the Western Federation of
Miners, as an organization, was to
day and had been the stumbling block
towards a settlement, Mr. Donelly
said the men had now shown a will
ingness to eliminate' any organization
In order to bring about a settlement,
"but we demand the right of organ!-

I Phoenix, Jan. 12. Col. Harris,
head of the state militia, when ln-
, formed yesterday evening of the ac
. tion of the Clifton district miners In
j withdrawing from the Western Feder
ation of Miners, said:
"There is a big doubt in my mind
'as to whether the action of tie men'
in pulling away from the Western
Federation of Miners will hasten the
termination of the present strike. The
mine owners 'have all along held that
they would refuse to treat with 'the
strikers as long as the latter were af
filiated wtth the Western Federation
of Miners, but there has always been
a disposition on the part of the men
to believe that even if they did cut
.Ioc-se from tbe big organization, the
managers would still refuse to make
.any concessions to them. The basic
principle at the bottom of the trouble

might have, but only the question of
whether or not the mine owners will
pay fair wages, and unless these
wage compromises are met, the strike
will continue Indefinitely. However,
the men are drawing away from the
federation in an effort to remove any
cause or excuse which the managers
might 'have toward a settlement, and
now that they have taken this action,
,at is up to the owners to make good
I their promises."
John L. Donelly's Statement. '
I Vice-President John L. Donelly, in
an interview with an Era representa-
"When the workmen of this district
finally agreed to renounce their al
legiance to the Western Federation of
Miners, as demanded by the mine
managers as a preliminary to a set
tlement of the present strike, I had
little faith that the managers would
then consent to a conference, but
the action was taken by the men in
order that the main obstacle looking
towards a conference and a settlement
might be removed and the citizenship
of Greenlee county and the "citizen
ship of Arizona be convinced that the
former employees were ready and
willing to meet the managers more
than half way."
Continuing Mr. Donelly said:
"You may quote me as saying that
under present conditions the strike
. will be continued, at least until the
'managers see fit to apply the same
scale that prevailed in 1914, prior to
the ten per cent reduction which was
maae at tne outoreaK or tne European
war and which has never been fully .re
work in other mining camps of the
state "
What Means This Strike?
(By John L. Donelly).
For four ' months Greenlee county,
Arizona has suffered industrial paraly
sis, "a whole community'of' citizens In
a sovereign state have been made the
plaything, of a struggle between two
contending interests in' the mining in
dustry.'1 On the one hand, the three
mining company1 managers have held
aloof, in a somewhat, (to them); dig
nified manner, refusing to deal with
their former ' workmen, unless they.
1 the workmen, eliminated the Western
Federation of Miners as a factor 1 In
the pending struggle.. On the other
hand the workmen have ' steadfastly
remained loyal to the Western Fed
eration of Miners, declaring that the
managers attitude was simply a sub
terfuge and that elimination of the
Western Federation of Miners would
jbe made the basis for no organization
at all, in other words the Mine Mana-

ARIZONA'S "BLUE SKY"
LAW IS MADE MORE RIGID
Phoenix, Jan. 10. Arizona's "blue
sky" law, already one of the most
rigid in the country, has been made
even more so In its operation by a
recent order of the corporation com
mission. The order is designed to
insure that the promoters of invest
ment companies will not withdraw be
fore such concerns are able to
stand on their own feet financially.
To each permit, now 1 Issued the
following clause is attached:
"This permit is granted conditioned
that the stock issued for property
shall be pooled and not sold, mort
gaged, assigned or offered for sale
until the stock authorized to be sold
by this permit is fully sold and the
proceeds therefrom have been paid
into the treasury of the . company.
Any violation of the conditions men
tioned in the above shall render the
permit void."

that these were returned when . they

deputies taken to Clifton and Mo

P. Dillon has returned to his office
at Phoenix and two deputies only re
main at Clifton to complete the
making of reports and returns for
the court. ' . '
Mr; McDonald this 'morning said
he was well pleased with the work
of his deputies in successfully carry
ing out the order of the court with
out friction and without having to
make an arrest in the disturbed min
ing district. He said the companies,
the strikers and officers of Greenlee
county all deserved praise and thanks
for giving generous aid to the United
States officers.
"The only trouble of any kind dur
ing the period , was when men were
brought from Duncan to do the as
sessment work. Weapons were no
ticed on them and Marshal Dillon
made a personal search and seized
62 guns and 7 dirks. He' was desir
ous of maintaining peace and did not
wish to be placed in the position of
having escorted so many armed men
into the strike district.
The deputies stated that guides
were furnished them by both strikers
and the companies, and particular
praise .is deserved by Deputy Sheriff
Alex Arnett, well known in Bisbee
who aided them at Morenci in keep
ing the peace. Henry Libeaux, one
of the strikers, also was of much as
sistance. "The night before the federal officers
left the district a band composed of
strikers gave a serenade, and speech
es followed in which the striking
miners gave thanks and praise to the
deputies and Marshal Dillon."

OF
COPPER BREAKS
The production of copper in the
United States in 1915 passed all
previous records, according to the
United States geological survey. Pre
liminary figures and estimates . have
been collected by B. S.- Butler, who
has received reports from all plants
known to produce blister copper from
domestic ores and refined copper.
At an average price of about' 17.3
cents a pound the output for 1915 has
a value of 1230,000,000, compared with
$152,968,000 for the output for 1914.
The figures showing .smelter pro
duction from domestic ores represent
the ' actual production of most of the
companies for 11 months - and, an
estimate of the output for December.
The figures of a few companies for
November were not available, 1 and
