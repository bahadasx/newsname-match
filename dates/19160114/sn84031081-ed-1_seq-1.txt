the demand of the United States gov
ernment that he take immediate
stops for the apprehension and pun

killed American citizens near Chihua

Walt Eirst iHcfs Answer.
While anxiously awaiting Carrun
za's response, the American officials
continued their efforts today to ob
tain all the facts bearing on the mur
ders from consular officers in Moxi
co and along the horder. They had
been ordered to investigate and ex
pedite their reports.
Officials particularly wanted to
know whether the murders were due
to the failure of the de facto govern
nicnt of Mexico to afford proper pro
tection In a zone known by It to be
dangerous or whether the men lost
their lives as the result of a bandit
attack which could not have been
foreseen.
The latest Mexican outrages, con

Slnvdt'ii Is Emphatic,
In the house, Representative. Slay
den, of Texas, declared the time had
come for a Pan-American union to
bring peace to Mexico and insisted
that only the execution of the slayers
of the Americans would satisfy the
people of border states.
"The rising anger of Americans on
the border is dangerous and can not
be trifled with," he declared.
"The president did the proper and
only possible thing in adopting the
suggtion to recognize Carrnnza. It
was an intolerable condition anil
someone had to bp recognized. The
choice lay between Carranza and'
j Villa, the unspeakable. ;

.Shortly after 1 o'clock Thursday I
afternoon the general sank Into un-j

viously abandoned all hope for pro

General Huerta had been ill for!
nearly six months, his Illness flidf he

attributed death to a complication of 1

parently improved after a stay at;
