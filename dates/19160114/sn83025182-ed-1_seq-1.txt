LONDON, Jan. 14,—'The National
Rallwaymen's union, one of the
strongest labor organizations In Great
Britain, today defied the government
to enact the conscription bill.
In the most drastic, resolution yet
adopted by any labor body, the execu
tive committee of the railway men de
clared their organization will resist
conscription to the uttermost. They
hinted at an Immediate sftrlke of all
railway workers of Great Britain if
the bill passes parliament.
"Unless the government Is prepared
to confiscate the wealth of the priv
ileged classes for the more successful
prosecution of the war/' read the reso
lution, "the railway workers will re
sist to the uttermost the confiscation
of men, whose only wealth is their la
bor power."
The executive committee declared
the railways workers overwhelmingly
opposed to any form of conscription.
They have not receded, they said,
from the poaition they to'ok several
months ago when they warned the
government that an attempt to en
force conscription would be followed
by a general strike.
The drastic action of the railway
men, coupled with the anti-conscrip
tion resolutions adopted by repre
sentatives of the miners yesterday, un
questionably has caused the govern
ment concern. Premier Asqulth con
ferred informally today with the
members of the cabinet.. It was ru

EXCHANGE OF BLOWS
BEFORE FORD LEFT
Exciting Times Among the Peace

[By Charles P. Stewart. United Press

THE HA- JE, Jan. 14.—A wild
scene preceded Henry Ford's depar
ture from the peace expedition at
Christiania, it was learned here to
day. Several Ford leaders exchanged
blows before Ford sped away in an
automobile to catch a train that was
to take him to Bergen when he look
passage for New *"ork. This infor
mation was obtained from a trust
worthy source and with it the "in
side story" of events aboard the peace
ship Oscar II and in Christiania.
Ford, it was learned for the first
time, investigated Mme. Rosika

European rulers encouraging th'e

At the same time he hoped an en

hopes of success. When the Norwe

to leave and had Dean Marquis of

Victoriano Huerta lay dead in his
apartments here today, the corpse
virtually a prisoner of the United
States government with which he
nearly went to war when, as Mexico's
last dictator, he refused to salute
the American flag, following the his
toric Tampico incident.
His wish to die on native Mexican
soil was prevented by his arrest and
indictment for plotting to invade
Mexico to crush Carranza.

held responsible by Carranza for as

Vice President Suarez.
Huerta was sixty-one years old last,

since Wednesday he had been uncon
scious. Four operations for gall stones
and complications were performed on
him in the last two weeks. Arrange
ments for the funeral were to be
made late today.

No Martial Law.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 14.—Martial
law has not been declared at El Paso
by General Pershing, Secretary Gar
rison said today, the army officer not
having authority to act without or
ders and no such orders having been
issued. Request from Governor Fer
guson to the federal government
would first be necessary before such
orders would be issued, he indicated.
In this connection, however, it was
recalled that General Pershing several
weeks ago was given practically un
limited authority in dealing with
trouble on the border. The war de
partment at the time Secretary Gar
rison explained the law concerning
martial law, had had no reports from
El Paso.
"I am content to die. I wish to
forgive all my enemies and all who
have done wrong toward me. I feel
at peace with my God and men."
Captain Francis P. Joyce, chaplain
of the Fourth United States field ar
tillery, a Roman Catholic priest, at
tended his last conscious moments.
Surrounding the bedside were
Huerta's entire family except his
daughter, Senorlta Llena, who was
enroute here from New York.
His faithful wife, Senora Agulla De
I Huerta, was the last person he recog
nized before dropping off into uncon
sciousness. Huerta kised his wife re
peatedly and called her nkme.
The twenty relatives knelt at the
bedside for hours in prayer, alters
nately led by Chaplain Joyce and a
Spanish priest, Father Mayer. The
bedside scene was lighted up dimly
by candles.
A short time before he died, Huerta
was visited by several of his former
army generals and other associates of
his administration. Gen. Ygacio
Bravo, for sixty-three years in active
service in the Mexican army and a
division general over Huerta when he
was a colonel of cavalry, was among
the group. General Bravo tried re
peatedly to obtain the dying man's
recognition and falling, knelt beside
the bed and wept.
After Huerta was pronounced dead,
his private secretary, J. Eliseo Robles,
declared "Huerta was killed Unit
ed States cruelty."
Reciting Huerta's consideration for
Americans when he was president.
Robles said: "He was thrown into
4Jail like a common criminal."
