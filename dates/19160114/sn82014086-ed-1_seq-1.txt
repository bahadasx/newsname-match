Not Likely That the Little
Unequal
ARMISTICE SAID TO HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON
Chief Significance of Austrian Domination of Montenegro

i Greek Island of Corfu Has Aroused Indignation in
Germany. - .
London, Jan. 13, 9.50 p. m. An
other decisive stage in the Balkan sit
uation has been reached, with Mon
tenegro now following Serbia in vir
tual absorption by the invading forces.
It was learned tonight that Austria
and Monteriegro had come to an armis
tice, this being construed as the last
act of the little country after having
its capital, Cettinje. dominated by the
, Austrian capture of Mount Lovcen.
;;. Great Advantage to Austria.
Whether King Nicholas will con
tinue the unequal struggle is consid
ered doubtfdl here, but the accepted
view among the best posted men in
London is that Montenegro has vir
tually passed Under Austrian control.
The chief significance of this lies not
in ,-the smalt' territorial acquisition,
which is less than Serbia, but in Mon
tenegro's Adriatic front, lying along
side the Austrian main offensive naval
base at Cattaro, ' where, today's des
patches announce, the entire Austrian
fleet, including three dreadnoughts, is
assembled and from . which the re
cent: naval raid was ' maSe against
Italian .'transports going ta' ,tbe relief
of Serbia. - - ; . v
Adriatic front with the dominating,
Trttvay eenter of Cattaro is viewed. as
further tending toward the realization
of Austria's, object of making the
Adriatic an Austrian - sea and thus
checking Italy's ambition to make it
-an jtalian sea. 2-'--. -j. '.
Waiting for Italy to Take Steps. '
Italy' has so' much at stake that
officials and diplomats had been wait
ing anxiously for the steps Italy would
take to relieve .Montenegro and at the
same time avert another Austrian ex
tension on the Adriatic. They were
aware that Italy had once before pre
vented Austria from gaining territor
ial concessions from Montenegro near
Cattaro by emphatically objecting to
the treaty made in 1912. r As Italy
was then 'a member of the triple al
liance, Austria reluctantly yielded to
the Italian objection.
' It wa) believed that dynastic rea
. sons would play ' a part in Italy's as
sistance of Montenegro, as King Nich
olas' daughter is the wife, of the king
of Italy, but help from ttiat quarter
did not arrive as the Italian expedi
tion was landed farther south, in Al
AMERICAN MINERS ARE
" LEAVING CHIHUAHUA
Ordered Out by AH the American Min
ing Concerns.
1 New York!', Jan. - 13. William Loeb.
Jrj managing director of the Ameri
can Smelting and Refining company,
announced today that he had received
word from his representative at El
Paso that : all the American mining
concerns In Chihuahua had ordered
'their men out of that territory. "-
Mr. Loeb said , that this action was
decided upon today at a meeting of the
Mines and Smelters association at El
Paso, an organization of mining con
cerns operating in the Chihuahua field.
He did not know, he said, how many
men would be affected but the num
ber : would run into several hundred.
Officials of the Green Cananea and
Phelps-Dodge companies. operating
mines in the Sonora district of Mex
- ico. . said . they were not affected bv
the recent disorders and that they
would not withdraw their men so long
as conditions remained as they are.
Carranza forces are in absolute con
trol of their district, thev said.
The Greeji-Cananea company re
ceived a telegram from its represen
tatives at Cananea, Sonora, saving ev
erything wa.s quiet. This apparently
disposes pt & rumor from El Paso that
three - Americans had . been murdered
in the Cananea district.

Allied Occupation of Corfu.
The news of the allied occupation
of Corfu is said to have excited the
greatest indignation in Germany,
where the fact that Achilleion Castle

said .that the emperor has sent a per
sonal protest . to the king of the
Greeks, holding Greece responsible for
any damage to German property. .
The official communication from
Constantinople asserts that the Turks

Alarming Rumors of .Kaiser's. Health.
' Rumors of - the state -of the Ger

sumed an alarmist tone, but without
authoritative backing. . A Rome des
patch reports that the crown prince
has been summoned to a council to
discuss measures in case the emper
or's illness is prolonged. An Amster
dam despatch attaches significance to
the fact that the emperor failed per
sonally to read the speech from the
throne at the opening of the Prus
sian Diet; and says that the emperor
repeatedly promised to be present at
this function. -
An Amsterdam despatch to the Ex
change Telegraph company says:
"The emperor is stilj abed suffering
from his throat and a fever has sea
in."
The correspondent fails to give the
source of his information, however.
The only news direct from Berlin
quotes the- Tageblatt as saying that
the "boil" from which the emperor is
suffering does not prevent his walk

GEN. HUERTA DIED IN
EL PASO LAST NIGHT.
It is Believed an Effort Will Be-Made
to Arrange For His Burial in Mexico.
EI Paso, Texas, Jan. 13. Victoriano
Huerta, former dictator of Mexico,
died here tonight.
General Huerta, who succeeded
General Francisco I. Madero in exec
utive power in Mexico City and later
left Mexico, died of sclerosis of the
liver. He was surrounded by his fam
ily when the end came. His death,
which occurred at 8.35 o'clock, was
not unexpected.
Funeral engagements are to be
made tomorrow, it was announced at
his residence tonight. It is believed
an effort will be made to arrange for
his burial in Mexico.
General Victoriano Huerta was a
professional soldier, and as such he
had, up to the overthrow of President
Francisco Madero, been known for his
loyal. support of the existing govern
ments. He fought loyally for Pres
ident Porfiro Diaz until his fall, and
when Diaz was no longer chief execu
tive, Huerta fought for Francisco de
la Barra, the Provisional President.
After Francisco Madero was elected.
Huerta found it to be his duty to sup
port one who had so long fought as a
rebel. His loyalty was not challenged
until the Felix Diaz revolution in Mex
ico City in February, 1913, when the
Madero- government was completely
overthrown and Huerta himself ele
vated to the presidency. .
Huerta was the moving spirit In the
consummation of the plot that . re
sulted in the seizure of the person of
President Madero and his brother
Gustave.
. The assissination of President Ma
dero and his brother followed and in
the meantime Huerta, with the mili
tary behind him, had been recognized
as the Provisional President.-

Orders To Kill
or Capture Bandits
HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY DE FACTO
GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO.
TROOPS ARE IN PURSUIT
Everv Carranza Soldier in Northern
Mexico to Be Pressed Into Service
If Necessary to Exterminate Outlaws
Washington, : Jan. 13.-Eliseo Arre
dondo, ambassador designate of the de
facto government of Mexico, called at
the state departmen today and personally-assured
Secretary Lansing that
Carranaz troops had been despatched
to western Chihuahua with orders to
kill or capture all - the bandits con
cerned in the slaying of American citi
zens. He said every Carranza soldier
in northern Mexico would be pressed
into service, if necessary, to achieve
this purpose.
'Slain Men Had Been Warned.
In a statement later Mr. Arredondo
declared that the men who lost their
lives had attempted to reach their
place of business before complete con
trol of the region had been accomplish
ed by the Carranza forces. He said
they had been given permission at
their own request to pass through the
Carranaz lines, although the Amen
cans had been warned to keep out of
territory in which guerilla warfare was
in progress.
Mr. Arredondo went to the state de
partment at the close of a day devoted
largely in official circles here to the
Mexican situation. .President Wilson
conferred with Secretary Lansing and
discussed the subject with callers. He
is understood to have told some of the
latter that the Chihuahua mine em
ployes had been specifically warned
not to go into Mexico.
Americans Warned to Leave.
During the day Secretary Lansing
made it clear that the United States
would expect from the de facto gov
ernment evidence. that the murderers
had been punished, and that if proper
steps were not taken an issue might
arise between the United States and
the Carranaz administration. This
statement was considered significant
of the determination of the United
States to enforce protection of its
citizens in 'Mexico. The secretary
added another warning to Americans
in Mexico to leave the districts where
there is revolutionary trouble. As to
the responsibility of the Carranza gov
ernment for the murders, Secretary
Lansing declared nothing would be de
termined until all the facts were at
"hand. - These? it was- agreed during the
conference with the president, should
be gathered from every reliable source.

ing to these reports, was slain while
prospecting near the Babricora ranch.

Keane was killed several weeks ago.
Keane's death was confirmed in to
day's -despatches. Bart Kramer was

and Carranza soldiers near Madera,

MRS. MOHR HAD WRITTEN CARD
1 TO BROTHER-IN-LAW.
TO AVOID "SAD ENDING"
Police Inspector Says Spetlman Gave
Him the Information on Which He
Proceeded Against Mrs. Mohr. . .
Providence. R. I.. Jan. 13. The al
leged confessions of the .two negroes,
C. Victor Brown and Henry H. Spell
man, who with Mrs. Elizabeth F. Mohr
are on trial charged with the murder
of .the latter's husband, Dr. C. Frank- '
iin Aionr, were narrated to the jury
today by William F. O'Neil. chief in
spector of police, who also told of the
circumstances leading to -those state
ments. Another alleged confession
signed by George W. Healis, Dr.
Mohr's negro chauffeur, who is to be
a witness for the prosecution, was
ruled out by the court.
No 8igned Statements.
A lengthy argument arose between
counsel over a question by Mr. Lewis
for the defense as to whether the
written memoranda purporting to be
confessions of Brown and Spellman
contained an admission by either that
he shot Dr. Mohr. The court eventu
ally admitted the question and In
spector O'Neil replied that there was
no such admission in the written state
ments. He added that he had not
finished taking Brown's story when
Mrs. Mohr was brought into his office
and interrupted him and that Brown
aid not . sign the statement
No Third Degree Methods Used.
The witness denied ' positively that
he used any third degree methods, so
called, on Brown and Spellman to get
them 'to make the statements. He said
that the only time he laid hands on
Brown was while he was conducting
him back and forth between his of
fice and the cell and that then he Just
took him "firmly, but gently by the
arm so he would not escape." H
denied that he annoyed Brown in his
cell from midnight till daylight to
prevent him from sleeping. .
Spellman Implicated Mrs. Mohr.
On cross examination by John J.
Fitzgerald, counsel for Mrs. Mohr, In
spector O'Neil did not deny that
George W. Rooks, brother-in-law of
Miss (Burger, Mr. Mohr's secretary,
was the first one to mention the name
of Mrs. Mohr after the arrest of Hea- '
Use on the night of the murder. It
was not true the Inspector declared,
that, from that moment, he tried-1 im
press his theory that Mrs. Mohr was
behind the murder upon all those who
were arrested in connection with the
case. The inspector said that Healis
implicated Brown and that Spellman
was the first to give him Information
on which he proceeded against Mrs.
Mohr.
Sent Warning to Miss Burger.
A card which Mrs- Mohr admits
having written before the tragedy to
George Rooks urging him to persuade
his sister-in-law to keep away from
Dr. Mohr's home at Newport, on pain
of "having a sad ending," was one of
the dramatic bits of evidence of the
day. Mrs. Mohr told the Inspector,
the latter testified, that she wrote
the warning in one of her "frenzied
moments that this woman. Miss Bur
ger, had aggravated her till she could
stand it no longer."
FORD PEACE PARTY
HAS CHOSEN DELEGATES.
But Not Without a Lively Titt Be
tween the Members.
The Hague. Jan. 13, via London, Jan.
14, 3.10 a. m. The Ford peace expedi
tion has elected the following Ameri
can members of the permanent peace
board to sit In Europe indefinitely
with the purpose of using all efforts to
settle the war: William Jennings
Bryan, Henry Ford, Miss Jane Ad
dams, the Rev. Charles F. Aked and
Mrs Joseph Fels, of Philadelphia.
The board will be composed of an
equal number of members from the
various neutral countries and will re
main in The Hague or Stockholm
with the financial backing of Mr.
Ford. Each member will receive a
salary and the entire expense of the
board will probably amount to $500,
000 yearly. Dr. Aked announced that
he would offer his resignation from the
San Francisco church.
Lively discussions among the mem
bers of the expedition over the
methods of choosing the members of
the permanent board marked the elec
tion. After the slate had been drawn
and offered as the choice of Mr. Ford,
its adoption being urged because Mr.
Ford was the financial backer of the
party, John D. Barry, of San Fran
cisco, branded the scheme as "a con
spiracy to railroad the selection with
out reference to the members." He
said it would be considered a farce in
the United States.
This plan was finally withdrawn
and the method of popular election
adopted. . .
