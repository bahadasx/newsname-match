Middlesboro, Ky., Jan. 8, E.
S. Helburt, former Mayor of
Middlesboro and candidate in 1911
for the Republican nomination
for Lieutenant Governor.of Ken
tucky, shot and killed Alf Farmer
a miner, at Bosworth late to-day,
while Farmer and F, L. Rene
baum, superintendent of the
Winona Coal & Coke Company,
were struggling on the ground
in front of the camp store.
The muzzle of Farmer's weap
on was pressing against Rene
baum's side after two shots had
been fired at the superintendent,
one grazing his abdomen, accord
ing to Helburn," and another shot
would have been fatal to Rene
baum. Helburn Gives Story
"A revolver was lying by a
window in the office of camp com
missary, and I seized this after
trying in vain to pull the men
apart and get possession of Far
mer's weapon," said Helburn.
"The trouble started when the
miner began abusing a woman,
Jane Wood, as she passed in front
of the store. He had been drink
ing, and his loud words and the
woman's protestations attracted
Mr. Renebaum, whoranoufrand
told Farmer to let the woman
alone. After a few words a shot
was fired at Renebaum, who rush
ed upon the miner and tried to
disarm him. In the straggle that
followed both fell to the ground,
and another shot was fired.
"I had been in the office with
Mr. Renebaum, and seeing that
his life was in peril, I ran to his
aid. The miner was fighting like
a demon, and both of us were no
match for his strength. Mr.
Renebaum is a friend of mine
as well as a law-abiding citizen.
"Since retiring a year ago as
Mayor of Middlesboro I became
engaged in the operation of mines
and was at the Bosworth camp
on business. The woman I had
seen before. That Supt. Rene
baum was justified in taking a
hand in her behalf, there could
bo no doubt, and that I was jus
tified in taking a hand in behalf
of Renebaum there seemed no
doubt to, me. When it became
fear to tread.
The love of money is the root
of all evil.
A good name is rather to be
chosen than great riches.
Betting is the fools argument.
A sucker is born every minnte.
The heights by great men
reached and kept were not at
tained by sudden flight
A fool's bolt is soon sho.t.
He is brought as a lamb to the
slaughter.
Diligence is the mother of good
fortune.
The wise man profits from the
folly of others.
Take care of the dimes and the
dollars will take care of them
selves.
We thrive at Westminster on
fools like you.
Such protection as vultures
give to'lamts.

apparent that nolhing could be
done but to me the revolver
which I foun 1 in the window, 1
used it as eTcctunlly as I knew
how.
ExPressctl Sorrow
"I am sorroy I killed the man.
It is the first thing of the kind
that I have been mixed up with.
I promptly surrendered to the
police. My bail was fixed at
$3,000, and I was released upon
providing the proper security.
Farmer has been living in the
community a good while, and bore
a fair reputation, when sober, so
far as I have been able to learn.
I will try to find out somethirg
of his family conn?ctions and do
what I can to relieve their be
reavement." Mr. Helburn was defeated for
ihe nomination for Lieutenant
Govneror by L, L. Bristow.
The above appeared in ihe
Louisville Courier Journal last
Sunday.
We were somewhat surprised
to learn of this affair. We have
known Mr. Helburn for the past
twenty years, and have known
him to be tne most genteel gent
leman in the whole community.
He is the last man we would have
ever"strp?-ls?dvould have done a
thing like that, and we believe
every word he said, that it was
only to save the life of a veo
dear friend, and we believe that
he considered it, absolutly the
only chance to save that faiend.
We regret, very much, to hear
of this as Mr. Helburn i3 one of
Kentucky's best and leading
citizens.

the bank but proud of the fact
that he is a stockholder of the

Hands Off, Judge!
"Tell your client I should
think she would feel proud
to have her daughter enter
the convent and give herself
to God when many otlur
young women of her age and
attractiveness are giving
themselves over to seeking
pleasure," said Justice Gieg
erich. N. Y. Sun, Dec. 1st.
Was not Justice Giegerich ex
ceeding the proper duties of his
)fhce in ottering these remarks:
According to the story in the
Sun, Mrs. Maria Bucellato ap
plied for a writ of habeas corpus
co get her twenty-year-old
laughter Angelina out of the
convent of the Sacred Heart.
The daughter became a novitiate
leveral months ago. The
mother said the daughter had
told her she wished to leave the
convent. The daughter appear
ed at the hearing with two nuns
nd told her mother's attorney
she had decided to rem: in in the
convent.
Very well: but why should
Justice Giegerhh throw the ir
(luence of the jwwers entrusted
to him by the State of New York
to balk a parent in getting bacK
her child? It is his judicial duty
to rebuke the reluctance of this
Italian mother to have her daugh
ter "give herself to God,"' with
vows prospectively irrevocable,
at the age of twenty?
