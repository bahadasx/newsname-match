NUMBER 2
MOCK TRIAL
VERDICT FOR PLAINTIFF
Curious And Sensational Facts
Disclosed in a Peach of a
Promise Suit.
The Peach of a Promise Suit
which has attracted the atten
tion of the people of Lexington
ever since the case was filed, was
tried Tuesday night before a jury
composed of William R. Taft,
Joseph G. Cannon, Chauncey M.
Depew, John D. Rockefeller, El
liott W. Major, Widrow Wil
son, John R. Sullivan, Theodore
Roosevelt, Dr. Cook, Admiral
Perry, Champ Clark and Admir
al Dewey.
The personel of the court had
all the ear marks of a regular es
tablishment I lis honor, always
mindful of the dignity of the
judiciary never laxed in disci
pline or forgot that the ends cf
justice is best attained by ser
ious and thoughtful delibera
tion. The sheriff, the clerk, the
crier and the expectant audience
so characteristic of a peach of a
promise trial, were all there.
As in all sensational trials
many interesting facts in the
lives of the parties thereto -were
brought out facts that never
would have otherwise been
toiown. The most surprising of
these was the hugging and kiss
ing proclivities of the plaintiff,
the susceptibility of the defend
ant and all of the male witnesses
to these same proclivities, the
-wit of the plaintiff's attorney,
the gallantry of the sheriff, and
the utter disregard of the truth
by all .the parties in the trial.
, In all court proceedure there
usually develops one .feature
which to the audience especially,
stands out clear and distinct
from all the others. This case
was no exception and the fea
ture in thi3 trial was commented
upon by every lady present; not
so much in a critical sense as in
a sort of a regretful sense. This
feature was the demoRstration
given by the Clerk in gum chew
Jng. . Mr. and Mrs. Peter Ilallott
spent Sunday in Wellington.
