Washington, Jan. 14.In an ap

bies," sent out today to every em
ploye of the United States Indian
service, Cato Sells, commissioner of
Indian affairs, cites statistics show
ing that approximately three-fifths
of the Indian infants die before they
are five years old. "Of what use to
this mournful mortality are our
splendidly equipped Indian schools?"

of the health and constitution of the
Indian children is the basic condi
tion which makes for the perpetua
tion of the once sturdy race, Com
missioner' Sells declares the cam
paign for better babies calls for re
doubled energy and zeal throughout
the service.
In outlining his plan, the com
missioner urges the elimination of
what he terms "intolerable" condi
tions that infest some Indian homes
and extension of the educational pro
paganda against disease.

NEER
WHEN IS AN AMERICAN?
Ed. I. Keen, United Press
Staff Correspondent, says
question is a hard nut to
crack in American em
bassy ^in London scores
"without a country."
By Ed. L. Keen.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
London, Jan. 14.When is an
American not an American? That
is a hard nut to crack, according
to the American embassy in Lon
don. Rather, it is a whole bushel
of hard nuts to crack. But some of
the nuts have been cracked, it was
learned today, with the results that
scores of "Americans" in England
are now without a country.
The issuance of passports is one of
the embassy's most troublesome du
ties. Numerous Americans who
have resided in England for ten,
fifteen or twenty years decided af
ter the war began, and more par
ticularly after the Zeppelins put
London on their calling list, that
they had better inquire into their
citizenship. All wanted American
passports. Some wanted to go back
to America. Others were bound for
France or other comparatively Zep
pelin-less climes. There was the
rub.
Passport officials at Uncle Sam's
London address struggled with the
problem. The applicants, many of
them with English accent, so long
had they been out of touch with
the Statue of Liberty, were forced
to answer imposing lists of ques
tions, which were forwarded to the
state department at Washington.
The department of state, acting on
a musty and long unused law, de
creed that to be recognized as an
American in a foreign country, a
person must report to the proper
American authorities at various
times, duly pay taxes in America if
he or she has enough property to be
taxed, o" make a visit home once in
a while. A great many Anglicized
Americans had failed in this, in
whole or in part. They are now
persons without a country. A pass
port is required to go 'most any
where at present. So America's
lost citizens are maroonedin Eng
land.
CUMMINS AND
ESTABROOK FILE
Minneapolis, Jan. 14.That A
B. Cummins and H. D. Estrabrook
will be the only republican presi
dential candidates filing in Minne
sota and that men favoring Hughes,
Root, Roosevelt, Burton and other
candidates will file for delegate pla
ces under the Cummins label, is the
outlook today as a result of the col
lapse of the "favorite son" plans
and the withdrawal of Elihu Root's
name. Harmony conferences are on
in efforts to agree on the personnel
of the Cummins delegation, giving
all factions a share. Roosevelt peti
tions are being put out by A. D.
Rahn, but may not be filed on ac
count of Colonel Roosevelt's atti
tude. Estabrook petitions were out
today. Responding to a personal
telegram from Mr. Rott, Guy V.
Howard has called in the Root peti
tions he has placed in circulation.
Ten petitions had accumulated 600
names in less than two days.
WILLIAM FOLEY
WINS LAKE LAND
William P. Foley of the Foley liv
ery barn was winner of the five-acre
tract of land which was given by the
Knights of Columbus. The contest
has been carried on for the last
two months and was concluded on
Wednesday night at the Grand
theater.
The proceeds, which will be turn
ed over to the Catholic church to
be applied to the new debt contract
ed by the remodeling of the church,
amounted to $400. The land is situ
ated across the lake.
Judge L. G. Pendergast returned
this morning from St. Paul where
he has been on business for some
time.

LITTLE COUNTBY NOW
UNDER AUSTRIAN CONTROL
Big Decision in Balkan Situation
Italy Situation
Critical.
Rome, Jan. 14.*Austrian artil
lery was trained on Gettinje and
Austrian gunners were awaiting a
signal to lay Gettinji in ruins when
King Nicholas of Montenegro sign
ed an armistice that practically el
iminated Montenegro from the Euro
pean war.
Decisive Stage.
This is another decisive stage in
the Balkan situation and the little
country of Montenegro followed Ser
bia in virtual absorption by invad
ing forces.
The armistice is being construed
as the last act of the little country.
Under Austrian Control.
Whether King Nicholas will con
tinue the unusual struggle is con
sidered doubtful here, but the ac
cepted view among the best posted
men in Rome is that Montenegro
has virtually passed under Austrian
control.
The chief significance of this does
not he in the small territorial ac
quisition which is less than Serbia,
but in Montenegro's Adriatic front,
lying alongside the Austrian main
offensive naval station at Cattaro,
where today's dispatches announce
the entire Austrian fleet, including
three dreadnoughts, is assembled
and from which recent naval
This further extension of Aus
tria's Adriatic front, with the dom
inating center of Cattaro, is Viewed
as further lending toward the reali
zation of Austria's object of mak
ing the Adriatic an Austrian sea and
thus checking Italy's ambition to
make it an Italian sea.
Italy has so much at stake that
officials and diplomats had been
waiting anxiously for the steps Italy
would take to relieve Montenegro
and at the same time avert another
Austrian extension on the Adriatic.
No Help Arrived.
It was believed that dynastic rea
sons would play a part in Italy's
assistance of Montenegro, as King
Nicholas's daughter is the wife of
the king of Italy, but help from that
quarter did not arrive as the Italian
expedition was landed further south,
Albania, and has not been heard
from since.
The Austrians this afternoon oc
cupied Gettinje and are pursuing the
enemy. The population of Gettinje
is calm.
Escaped Germans Arrested.
Wilmington, Jan. 14.The four
escaped German sailors from the in

Newport News were arrested here
today.

New York, Jan. 14.The Imperial

Washington, Jan. 14.Austrian
Charge Zwiedinek today cabled his
government for instructions how to
proceed on this government for al
lowing the Italian steamer Verdi to
leave New York with two three
inch guns. It is believed that rep
resentations to the United States
will follow.
Turks Take City.
Constantinople, Jan. 14.It Was
officially annuonced here that the
Turks have entered the Persian city
of Kermanshah.
Union Defies Conscription.
London, Jan. 14.The National
Railway Men's union, one of the
strongest labor organizations, today
defied the government to enact the
conscription bill. The executive
.committee declared that that body
should resist conscription to the ut
most. It is hinted that there would
be an immediate strike of all rail
way workers in England if the bill
is passed.
