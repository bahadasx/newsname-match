1V1U--
County Fnnn Agent to Organize-
Direct Clubs for Cotton, Com,
Ir, Peanuts, and Pigs. Adult Will
Also Have Clubs.
County Farm, Agent Fash Is busy
now organizing tho Boys Demonstra
tion Clubs for tho comjng year, and
says that by tho last of this month
tho lists should bo completed. Tho
boys are expressing eagerness for tho
work, and thoro will probably bo dou
Ulo tho club membership of last year.
Under tho rules of tho Department,
thero must bo at least ten boys In
each club, although as many boys as
wish may Join. Each boy must agreo
to farm at loast ono ncro of ground
under the full direction of tho agent.
Flvo clubs will bo organized this
year, ono' each for demonstrating on
corn, kaflr, cotton, pigs, and peanuts.
Endi boy may join all five clubs if ho
doslros to do so.
Tho service the farm agent ren
ders the club mombors consists of In
structing them In proper soil prepar
ation, seod selection, seed grading,
crop cultivation and gathering. Last
year and In former years, boys farm
ing thqjr ono-aCre plots in various
communities have raised twice as
good crops and twico as big yields as
neighbors farming under just any
method.
Adult clubs are also being organ.
Ized to demonstrate on tho samo
crops, tho instruction being the samo
as that given the boys, save that
thero must bo at loast fifty adults in
a club, although as many as wish
may take up tho work. Tho News
lias in former issues given figures
showing the accomplishments of
these clubs, which have shown con
clusively that scientific farming un
der known best methods is m'any
limes more productive than ordinary
slipshod farming. Mr. Fash reports
that the number of adult farmers ap
plying for club membership this year
Is many times larger than last year
or other years.
Of tho three grades of cotton com
monly used in this country, Mebano,
Triumph, and Row'den, Mr. Fash says
he has found the Rowden to be most
desirable for this locality. Ho says
that tho lint from Rowden Is strong
er, the staple bettor, and the seed
larger, while tho percentage of lint
z almost as. great as of Mebano. Ho
says also that It is a better crop to
stand unusual weather conditions
than the other two varieties of seed.
Asked about the so-called half and
lialf cotton, Mr. Fash said that to his
certain knowledge, tho spinners do
not want this cotton, and will not buy
It at any price If thoy know It. Tho
staple Is shorter and poorer than any
of tho three varellcs mentioned
above, while th eseed Is of such qual
ity as to bring a low price. He says
the percontage of lint is oftlmes
greater than from the other cottons,
but that tho considerable Inferiority
of grade makes half and half a poor
cotton to plant In this country.
FIRST NATIONAL WINS
GUARANTY FUND CASE
Tho Supremo Court has this week
d'stnlssod an appeal taken by the
State from the district court of this
nty ngalnst tho First Natlon.il

WANTS PUNISHMENT OF MURDERERS
S Secretary of State Lansing of the United States has demand-
5 ed of do facto President Carranza of Mexico that tho bandits who S
t early this week took seventeen Americans from a train near Chi- S
S huahua and robbed and murdered thorn, bo given punishment. S
? Authoritative Information had by Secretary Lansing says that tho J
$ bandits acted at tho Instance of the deposed chief and outlaw, Pan- J
y cho Villa, who has adopted a general policy of murdering and out- J
i aging all Americans caught. The atrocity haB been the cause of S
heated debate In tho U. S. Senate and will probably lead to a movo $
looking toward American intervention in Mexico and tho taking of
S drastic stops by this government to protect Americans In Mexico. J
Official Washington Is much stirred by the Incident. 3
v All U. S. troops now on tho bordor will bo retained at their $
$ present posts for the time being, and many more may go at once. J

COLRERT SCHOOL IS
DESTROYED RY FLAM US
Fire of unknown origin totally des
tiojed the new school building at
Colbert oarly Thursday morning, the
building being a mass of flames and
a roaring furnace inside when flro
was discovered at about 12:30 In tho
morning by Mr. Boll, who lives near
the building. The structure was a
modern brick and concrete one, and
wan built two years ago, after tho
burning or tho old frame building, it
was valued at $17,000, covered by
$10,000 Insurance. The-fact that
there had been no fire In tho building
Wednesday and no school that day
makes the fire more of a mystery.
Early Wodnesday morning when fire
vap started In tho furnace tho fur
nace blow out, crippling tho heating
plant, and school was dismissed for
tho day. Plans are being mndo now
to hold school somewhere olso with
ns little loss in tlmo as posslblo, and
the board of education will take steps
to Immediately rebuild tho building.

To the Editor, Durant Weekly News,
Durant, Oklahoma.
As to tho tax rolls being balled up,
will say that it is a fact that a good
many errors were made, but I find
that all tho orrors wore made in tho
transferring from the Assessor's rolls
to the Tax rolls. In -explanation, will
say that I was compelled by the Ill
ness of my wife to be nbsont from my
office from June till after her death,
which occurred in December, and I
had a deputy omployed to make up
the tax rolls, and thoso numorous
errors were made by him.
I will take pleasure In correcting
any mistake that has been made,
where It is posslblo to do so without
any cost to the taxpayer or the coun
ty. Now, as to tho man who claims
that he romlered $100 in money, and
that ho was charged with $1,000,
wish to say that this rendition sheet
showed $1,000, and was signed by
him.
I can show you whore, in one case,
Mr. J. B. Mooro of the Smith-Moore-Wllllams
Company, at Caddo render
ed his Building for $30,000.00, when
ho Intended to render It for $3,000,
and when I noticed how ho had ren
dered tho same, I called him on tho
phone and asked him if he had not
made a mistake, and he said that ho
had. Now, If I had desired to in
crease anybody's valuation, thero
would have been a good place to have
taken advantage or lis mistake.
Another man assessed his farm at
$15 per acre, and the Improvements
at $1,200, and I entered samo upon
the assessor's rolls as given in to me,
and when tho Equalization Board
met, I recommended that they lower
the value of the impovements to
$510, which they did. I never saw
this man in mylife, but was famil
iar with the farm In question. I will
be glad to show anybody the records
on any of these statements made.
As to the value of the lands beng
higher than previous years, will say
that with the exception of a few cas
es, where ther is some rough lands
assessed the same as good lands, I
do not think that the lands are es
scsued any too high. When I made
the race for Assessor you will remem
ber that I promised to bring the val
ues of land up so that the land valu
ations would be nearer In proportion
to the valuation of personal and city
property. I stand on tho platform
that every man should pay his equal
portion of the taxes. Let his money
be Invested In lands, town lots, hors
es or cattle, or any other property,
ho should pay his part.
Very truly,
W. H. YEATS,
County Assessor,
