Manager Decker states that tue Idle I of Assistant Prosecutor during the past
Hour is here to stay and that he is en
deavoring to merit the good will aud
support of everybody. He welcomes and
solicits suggestions from his patrons for
the betterment of the theater. "We
want the Idle Hour to be the people's
theater, and our object id to please," is
the way the manager stated it to The
True Northerner. "We are going to
continue to give our pttFOOt the befft
shows that can be bought to sell f r B
and 10 cents admission. If the public
desires the bigger features such as are
shown in the cities for an admission of
lf cents to $2 per seat, we will gladl) se
cure them and the pnci will be no more
than is charged in the citbs for similar
features. Just for example," said the
manager, "Take 'The Spoilers.' This
feature was shown for six weeks at the
Htudebaker theater if) Chicag , prior to
our booking, for 15, 3l aod 5) cents
i'his Aim cost the Idle Hour JliOO for
o ie day. We run it for a matinee and
one nitrbt show and our total receipts
were $78 So it must be evident to the
public that we cannot run the bi feat
ures for the regulation price of f and 10
cent.
"Our next beadliner will be'The Eter
nal City.' This is an 8 reel feature
which rents for $75 per day. The South
ern Michigan Amusement Co. has
booked it for one solid u.eek, so it will
cost the Idle Hour but $40, and we can
sell for 10 and 15 cents admission.
"It will be our constant aim to main
tain the high standard of entertaining it
established and we conscientiously be
lieve that the Idle Hour will compare
most favorably with BO) moving picture
theater in any city of 5000 inhabitants
in the state of Michigan.

year.
Following are the comments of The
South Haven Tribune of January 7:
G, M. Van Riper of Hartford is the
new assistant prosecuting attorney of
Van Buren county, his appointment
dating from January first.
The change came as a complete sur
prise to L. lrl Phelps of this city, who
has been aNHistant prosecutor for the
past year, and h not only had no in
timation that a cl.ange was to be made,
but did no know of it until he was i u
formed of it vlonday by a fellow attorney
whom Mr Vn Kiper bad told of the
change
Mr Phelps supposed that his appoint
in in was for the term of hiscnief, Pros
ec Jting Attorney Burhans, but it ap
pears that the latter gave Mr. Van Kiper
the choice of serving as assistant for the
tirat or second ear of the term, and Mr.
Van Riper look the second year.
Mr Burhans explains in his letter to
Mr. Phelp-, vhich, b the way, although
dated De;: 111), did not reach li m until
v edneada) , Jan 5, that lie did not tell
him of the plan to change at the end of
the year for fear Mr Phelps would not.
put forth bis best efforts as assistant.
It will be interesting to observe
whether at the end of six nmntbs Mr,
VanHiper will he displaced to make room
for Dunne Mosier, whose friends aver
that Mr. Burhans promised him the
Mtittant'f post for the whole two years
of the latter's current term.''

SPRAYING MIXTURE
TO BE AT PREMIUM
It is a question as to what tbe fruit
growers are going to do this yenr for
spraying material. Blue vitrol is the
priiiciptl part of th spraying mixture,
Hid the grower who in compelled to pur
chase this chemical this ear, will either
have to have a big hank account or a
iold mine. Mr. tlindenach of the Paw
I'nw drug Co , states to The True Nor
therner that last year this comptny sold
i enr load of blue vitriol to tho fruit
iirocrH i f I'rtw Pw mid vicinity This
carlnnd cost the Drug companv about
J2,(00. A like car loud tfts ear will
coal about 10.000. In other words the
grower who purchased a barrel of vitriol
km year and paid about $23 00 for the
sHine. will, if he i eeds a barrel this ft .r
be compelled to pay about Ave tunes a
much or 1115. This certainly ia not a
very encouraging situation for the fruit
grower, and the worst of it is, there is
no prospect of an immediate relief from
these high prices-
