BITTER ARRAIGNMENT
AT HAND OF STATE
"Murderer of Most Fiendish
Type" Declares Public
JPrpseqitor.
Minneapolis, Jan. 13.—Character­
izing the defendant as "a murderer
of the most fiendish type," Prosecu­
tor (George W. Armstrong pleaded
with the jury late today to convict
Frederick T. Erica, a Minneapolis
business man on trial in the district
court here, charged with murdering
Mary Fridiey Price, his third wife,
for her fortune.
Reach Jury Today..
When the prosecutor completed his
arguments to the jury, court recessed
until tomorrow morning. M. C. Brady,
chief counsel for the defense, then
will argue In behalf of Price, and the
case probabl) will reach the jury
shortly after noon.
Court Room Packed.
In a courtroom packed to ov6r
flowing, the prosecutor tersely re­
viewed the evidence, which he de­
clared, "shows beyond the shadow of
a doubt that Price lured his wife to
the East River road cliff on the night
of November 28, 1914, on the pre­
tense of giving her an ounting, hurled
her on the rocks below, went to her
Bide
and knelt down, but instead of
praying for forgiveness, seized a rock
and crushed her head."
"This, gentlemen," the prosecutor
shouted, "is the crime of the mail
who asks you for freedom that he
may continue his checkered career."
The "Iron Man."
Price, who has been referred to
during the trial as the "iron man"
listened closely to the words of the
nrosecutor wit no show of emotion.
Tried to Involve Etchison.
Before resting its case, the defense
placed on the witness stand Dr. D. u.
Cowles, who \Vas present at the
autopsy on the body of Mrs. Price,
injuries about the head, could have
been caused by a blow from a mon­
key wrench. The defense has tried
to shdV that if the woman was mur­
dered,1 Charles D. Etchison, the chief
witness who testified Price killed his
wife, struck the blow while Price was
repairing his automobile.
Destroyed Will.
Etchison. a young travelling man
of Washington, who after his arrest
on a joint indictment with Price,
swore Price paid him for his silence,
was recalled to the stand by the
state and testified that Price had de­
stroyed Mrs. Price's will.
Mrs, Etchison on Stand.
Mrs. E'chison also took the stand
and wept as she denied Price's testi­
mony that she lived with Etchison
before thier marriage. Hundreds of
women present also wept'. Contrary
to expectations, Carrie Olson Price,
the defendant's fourth wife, was not
called iiport to testify for the de­
fense.
"I haVe already caused her enough
sorrow/! Price said.
Forty Five Degrees Below Low*
est in History of Local
Office.
When a minimum temperature of
forty-five degrees below zero was re­
corded at the United States weather
bureau office in Bismarck yesterday
morning, a record for low tempera­
ture was established. This was
one degree lower than any pre­
vious low temperature in the history
of the 'local office, covering a period
of more than forty years. The near­
est approach was -44 degrees on Jan.
2, 1887. The coldest period, however,
was during the first eight days of
January. 1887, when the following
minimum temperatures were record­
ed: 1st -41, 2d -'4, 3d -16, 4th -4, 5th
-24, 6th -37, 7th -40, 8th -42. That
was also the coldest month of record
for the local office, the average mini­
mum temperature being -15.7. On
but three days during that month
was there a minimum temperature
above zero.
As the crest of the cold wave has
already passed beyond the east
boundary line of the Dakotas, tem­
peratures above zero are probable by
Saturday. It is not anticipated that
the average for the month will be
anything like as low as that for Jan­
uary, 1887. While Bismarck was the
coldest spot in iNbrth Dakota from
which reports are daily received,
many local points in the Northwesl
were considerably lower.

Mexican Dies on American Soil
Exile From His Native
Land.
TOOK LEADING PART IN
MADERO ASSASSINATION
Fought Loyally for President
Diaz and Assisted in Organ­
izing Army.
(El Paso, Texas, Jan. 12.—'General
Victoriano Huerta, former provisional
president of iMexico, died here to­
night.'
General Victoriano Huerta was a
professional soldier, and as such he
had, up to the overthrow of President
Francisco Madero, been known for
his loyal support of the existing gov­
ernments. He fought loyally for
President Porfirio Diaz until his fall,
and when Diaz was no longer chief
executive, iHuerta. foulght for Fran­
cisco de la Barra, the provisional
president. After Francisco Madero
was elected Huerta found it. to be
his duty to support one who had so
long fought as a rebel. .His loyalty
was not challenged until the Felix
Diaz revolution in Mexico City, in
February, 1913, when the .Madero gov­
ernment was completely overthrown
and Huerta himself elevated to the
presidency.
Huerta devoted himself to the mili­
tary career at a very early age. Born
at Chihuahua in 1854, he entered the
Military academy of Chapultepec, at
the age of 17, and passed through
the full course to graduation in 1875,
when he was commissioner second
lieutenant of engineers. During his
academic term he was known for his
predilection for scientific studies,
particularly astronomy and mathe­
matics.
(When Porfirio Diaz began his reor
ganization of the Mexican army Huer­
ta was promoted captain of engineers
Ihd while holding" this rank devised
the plan for a Mexican general staff
corps. He was an active member of
the Military Map commission, creat­
ed to draft a staff map of Mexico on
a large scale, and he had charge of
all the astronomical work of the com­
mission, leading exploring and sur­
veying parties over the wildest re­
gions of the republic.
'Huerta was the moving spirit in
the consummation of the plot that re­
sulted in the seizure of the person
of president Madero and his brother,
Gustave.
The assassination of President Ma­
dero and his brother followed, and
in the meantime Huerta, with the mil­
itary behind him, had been recogniz­
ed as the provisional president.
To Arrange Funeral.
General Huerta, who succeeded
General Francisco I. Madero in execu­
tive power in Mexico City, and later
left Mexico, died of sclerosis of the
liver. He was surrounded by his
family when death came. His death
was not unexpected.
Funeral arrangements are to be
made tomorrow, it was announced at
his residence tonight. It is believed
an attemnt will be made to arrange
his burial in Mexico.

Word came from Washington today

American Counsels May Be With­
drawn From Durango Unless
Peace Is Restored,
Washington, Jan. 13.—In congress
again today intense indignation at
the latest outbreaks on Americans in
Mexico was reflected. Senator Lewis,
democrat, introduced a resolution to
authorize the sending of armed forces
of the United States into Mexico to
protect American citizens and their
property. He asked that the resolu­
tion lie'over and this was done with­
out debate.
Time Has Come.
'Representative Hayden of Texas,
democrat, made a speech in the house
declaring the time has come for the
Pan-tAmerican nations to restore
peace in Mexico. He insisted only
the summary execution of the mur­
derers would satisfy the people of
the border state.
Proposed Sending Army.
Representative Moss oL' West Vir­
ginia, republican, introduced a reso­
lution proposing to send a sufficient
force of the army to Mexico to cap­
ture the murderers, ^nd the dispatch
of warships to Mexican waters to co­
operate with the army ,and remain
there until the personal property of
American citizens were saved.
Lansing/Conference.
Secretary!'Lansing explained that
his conference had to do with the
problem confronting the state depart­
ment of gaining accurate informa­
tion. There were no American con­
suls in the immediate neighborhood
of the points where the massacre oc­
curred, and tbo fc^iiaiy" indicated
•there was a possibility that all Amer­
ican consuls might, be withdrawn
from the provinces of Durango, Chi­
huahua, and Sonora, until complete
order is restored.
Secretary LansinK made it clear
that there was nothing to indicate
that the Carranza authorities had not
done everything in their power to ap­
prehend the bandits.
The United States, he said, will ex­
pect that the bandits be punished and
evidence of the punishment must be
forthcoming. Upon the developments
depends the nature of the action the
United States will require.
Promises to
Make Amends
Washington, Jan. 13.—Ambassador
Eliseo Arredondo of the de facto gov­
ernment of Mexico called at the state
department today and assured Secre­
tary Lansing that Carranza troops
had been dispatched to eastern Chi­
huahua, with orders to capture or kill
all the bandits who killed the Ameri­
cans.
In a statement. Mr. Arredondo later
stated that the men who lost their
lives had attempted to reach their
place of business before complete
control of the region had been ac­
complished by the Carranza forces.
He said they had been given permis­
sion at their own request to pass
through the Carranza lines, although
Americans had been warned to keep
out of territory in which guerilla
warfare was in progress. Mr. Arre­
dondo went to the state department
at the close of a day devoted largely
in official circles here to the Mexican
situation.
President Wilson conferred with
Secretary Lansing and discussed the
subject with callers. He is under­
stood to have told some of the latter
that the Chihuahua, mine employes
had been warned specifically not to
go into IMexico.
During the day Secretary Lansing
made it clear that the United States
would expect from the de facto gov­
ernment evidence that the murderers
had been punished and that if proper
steps were not taken an issue nnght
arise between the United States and
the Carranza administration. The
secretary added another warning to
Americans in Mexico to leave dis­
tricts "where there is revolutionary
trouble."
As to the responsibility of the Car­
ranza government for the murders.
Secretary Lansing said nothing would
be determined until all facts were at
hand.

ano company, who is in the Bismarck
hospital undergoing treatment, is

Asks Governor to Pardon Mother
Who Murdered Divorced Husband
Savannah, Ga., Jan. 13.—(Special)
Mrs. Sarah Godbeo Griner of Kansas
City, Mo., has appealed to the Geor­
gia prison commission and Governor
Nat. E. Harris to grant a pardon to
her mother, Mrs. lOdna Perkins God
bee, now serving a life sentence for
the murder at Millen, Ga., a few
years ago of her divorced husband,
Judge Waiter H. Gartbee, and his
young bride, Miss Florence
Boyer of
Youngstown,
Penna. The
daughter declares that, her mother
was driven insane by persecution be­
fore she committed the crime.
"Nobody knows, outside of myself
and my mother, what we went
through in our home," Mrs. Griner
told the commissioners. "For years
I tried, aa a girl who loved both my
father and my mother, to palliate his
wrongs to her and to bring them to­
gether in peace and happiness. I
tried to conceal our family troubles
from the world. Finally, the abuse
and cruelty heaped upon my mother
killed all my love for my father, and
during my mother's imprisonment
and trial I stayed by her and told to
the world the whole tragic and hu­
miliating story of our domestic un
happiness.
"My father mistreated my mother,
slandered her, took her property
away from her and divorced her. He
then advertised for a wife, married
the woman who answered the adver­
tisement, and brought her to Millen
and lived with her at ease on the
proceeds of the sale of my mother's
property. He publicly flaunted his
new wife in my mother's face, and
overlooked no opportunity to mortify
and humiliate my mother in every
way he could think of. It was more
than she or any other woman could
bear, and finally, in her desperation
and unbalanced mental condition, she
shot the man who had wronged her
FBEEJLLIPINES
Urges Absolute Independence as
Moral Duty of This
Nation.
(Washington, Jan. 13.—Senator Mc
Cumber of North Dakota, republican,
today advocated giving the peopie of
the Philippine Islands independence,
asserting that the United States not
only was morally bound to such an
action, but that possession of the
islands was a constant, menace from
a military point of view. He intro­
duced an amendment, to the pending
bill for extending to the Philippines a
greater degree of self-government,
which would authorize the president
to seek an international agreement
to guarantee the autonomy of the
island, aid the Filipinos in establish­
ing a stable government, and then
to proclaim independence. A vote on
the bill is expected Saturday.
Submarines
Active Again
London, Jan. 13.—The British
steamship, Glengyle, sunk in the Med­
iterranean sea on January 2, was tor­
pedoed without warning, according to
a Havaas dispatch from Marseilles
today.
The same dispatch reports that the
steamer Tafnia, which arrived at
Marseilles from Phillipeville, escaped
for the second time from a submar­
ine by speed and clever maneuvers.
Captain Chester of the Glengyle
and 20 men of the crew were picked
up by the steamer Mossul, the dis­
patch adds, while three Englishmen
of the crew and seven Chinese were
lost.
The Dutch steamer Maashaven of
2,609 tons, bound from Norfolk to
Rotterdam has struck a mine, ac­
cording to a wireless message pick­
ed up at Scheveningen forwarded by
Reuter's correspondent at the Hague.
The crew is reported to have aban­
doned the steamer while the vessel
was still afloat.
A dispatch to Reuter's Telegram
company from Petrograd says that
Russian torpedo boats on Monday de­
stroyed a Turkish submarine that
had grounded near Milan. Two Turk­
ish sailing ships with coal were also
destroyed.

The Wonderfully Sad Story of
the Reconstruction Period
Pleased All.
THE LITTLE COLONEL
WAS SPLENDID TYPE
Of the Best of the Chivalrous Ar­
istocracy of the Old
South.
Never has the history of the period
of Reconstruction been so vividly
and faithfully portrayed as when The
Birth of A Nation was shown at the
Auditorium. Thursday night. In
every particular the filming had been
done with the greatest exactness so
that the story of the Ku Klux Klan
and the emergence of the South from
the domination of the carpetbaggers
and their ignorant minions, could be
honestly and clearly shown. The ef­
fects, the scenes, the characters,
were such that anyone at all familiar
with the history of the days succeed­
ing the close of the Civil War, could
immediately recognize and realize
the story while containing its pretty
romance, is wholly historical. That
the theme marked the rise of the
white race who had held the negro
in slavery, from an aristocracy to an
industrial factor in the government
of the United States.
White and Black.
"The east is east, and the west is
west, and never the twain shall
meet," was amply demonstrated by
the picture in such a delicately re­
fined way, that the most partisan
could find nothing within the entire
series of pictures that would cause
the first inclination toward race hat­
red or prejudice. However, the fact
was shown so clearly and so suc­
cinctly that amalgamation or inter­
marriage between the two races, is
an utter impossibility. The line is
drawn and the recognition of the
status of the two races, as given in
The Birth of a Nation, will be an ad­
vantage to both, and side by side
they can advance in harmonious rela­
tions to the highest in education and
industrial freedom.
The Music Was Superb.
The music, selected with a piece
appropriate to each and every scene,

Armistice Declared With Central

ADRIATIC FRONT IS
BIG GAIN OF C0NQUE8*
Strikes Blow at Italy's Ambitions
in This Sphere of the
Conflict.
iLondon, Jan. 13.—Another decisive
stage in the Balkan situation has
been reached with Montenegro now
following Serbia in virtual absorption
by the invading forces. It was learn­
ed tonight that Austria and Montene­
gro had come to an armistice, this
being construed as the last act of
the little country after having its cap­
ital, Cettinje, dominated by the Aus­
trian capture of Mount Lovcken.
Whether King Nicholas will continue
the unusual struggle is considered
doubtful, but the accepted view
among best posted men in London is
that iMontenegro has virtually passed
under Austrian control.
Control of Adriatic.
The chief significance of this does
not lie in the
Bmall
Italy Much at Stake.
Italy has so much at stake that,
officials and diplomats Jiave been
waiting anxiously for the steps Italy,'
would take to relieve Montenegro and(:
at the same time avert another Aus­
trian extension on the Adriatic.
It was believed that dynastic rea­
sons would play a part in Italy's as­
sistance of Montenegro, as King (Nich­
olas' daughter is the wife of the king
of Italy, but help from that quarter'
did not arrive, as the Italian expedi-'
tion was landed farther south in Al­
bania, and has not been heard from
since.
Seize Kaiser's Castle.
The news of the Entente allies' oc­
cupation of Corfu is said to have ex­
cited the greatest indignation in Ger­
many, where the fact that Achilleion
castle is to be used as the Serbian
headquarters, is regarded as a per­
sonal insult to the German emperor.
It is said that the emperor has sent
a personal protest to the king of
Greece, holding Greece responsible
for any damage to German property.
The official communication from
Constantinople asserts that the Turks
knew in advance about the Anglo
French plan for the abandonment of
the last Dardanelles positions And
made preparation accordingly, but
the fire of the warship^ seems to
have been successful in screening the
retiring troops.
There was an incident -between the
Greek and Entente allied troops when
the latter blew up the iron bridge
over the Struma river at Demlr-His
sar.
The officer commanding the Greek
guards at the bridge ordered his men
to resist the accomplishment by the
Entente allied troops of their pur­
pose, and at the same time requested
reinforcements. While awaiting the
arrival of the reinforcements, the
bridge was blown up and the Entente
allies then withdrew, thus avoiding
further difficulty.
