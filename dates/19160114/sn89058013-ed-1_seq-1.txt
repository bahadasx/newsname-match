A , MODEL DRUGSTORE.
It has fallen to the lot of the
writer to travel up and down this
splendid commonwealth to" a con
siderable extent, both in search of
business and pleasure, and without
an attempt to flatter the manage
ment of the Fry Drug Co. it can
be truthfully said that no town out
side of our large cities can compare
with the improvements recently
made by this company.
The furnishings in their new
store on the south side are entirely
new,, consisting of modern mahog
any cases, heavy plate glass mir
rors, a well-appointed prescription
case, and it is a pleasure at any and
all times now to euter. as conven
iently and tastefully arranged store.
And if there is any profession in
which it is necessary, for a m.an to
thoroughly know his business it is

sundries the store is well stocked
with notions, jewelry, perfumes,
toilet articles, flue cigars, paints,
oils, varnishes, dyes, and, iu fact,
everything that is usually found in

which characterize this store.
J. M. BEATON.
Elsewhere in this issue of The
Chronicle appears the announce
ment of J. M. Beaton of the eighth
district as a candidate for Trustee
of Benton County, subject to the
action of the Democratic party.
Mr. Beaton has never held coun
ty office,' but he is a public spirited
man, seeking at all to do with the
very best reasoning aud sound judg
ment that which he is convinced is
for the best interest of his county.
He filled the position of Consta
ble in the ninth district to the sat
isfaction of everyone. He attended
school in. Camden iu 1891 and car
ried off the medal for efficiency and
good deportment. Mr. Beaton has
been a candidate for sometime, aud

sible. Give his claims your care
ful consideration. .
