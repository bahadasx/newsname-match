Tuition Measure.
Senator Verner called up his bill
requiring all students attending,
State colleges to pay $40 /tuition j
each year and to abolish all seliol- j
irships in the same. He denounc-1
2d men who are able to pay their
son's way to college swearing they ,
ire not able to do so. The Oconee I
Senator thought the colleges were
costing too much and said it was a
grievance that he had to send his,
ion 400 miles to the University of
Alabama, where he could afford to
send him because he would not go
up and swear he was not able to
pay tuition. He said the laws
should be enforced and scored "perjurers."
He stated that the poor
men did not get advantage of the
scholarships, but they were obtained
by sons of rich men. Senator
Verner suid Jhere was a man who
lived near him worth $100,000 who
liad two sons in the state colleges
md who swore ho was not able to
pay hi111oil.
"Let's make all pay tuition or
Have it tor none " said Senator Vernr?r.
lie directed the attention of the Senite
to the University and said that
most of the students there when at
boine were waited on by their
mothers and as soon as mey come
to the University they require fifteen
janitors to wait on them "and
begin to put on airs.''
Senator Slnkler conceded that
there was sometimes a vice In the
Kcholarshlp and some had them that
did no deserve he honor but he
naked the Oconee Senator to use his
talent to bring in a bill to remedy
the defect fmd not to abolish the
scholorshlp* pointing out that many
deserving boys had been helped to
efficient mafihood by thefce scholarships.
He said the matter was being
considered by the college trustees

B'ty oonra were wonting on me matter

El Paso, Tex., Jan. 13.?Victoriano
Huerta, foremer diactor of
Mexico, died here toniKl>tGeneral
Huerta, who succeeded
Gen. Francisco I. Madero in executive
power in Mexico City an('
later left Mexico, died of sclerosis
of the liver. He was surrounded by
his family when the end came at
8:35 o'clock. His death was not
unexpected. Funeral arrnUgoments
are to be made tomorrow, it was announced
nt his residence tonight. Tt
is believed an effort will be made
to arrange for his burial in Mexico.
Gen Vlc^oriano Iluerta was a
professional soldier and as such
he had up t? the overthrow of
President Francisco Madero hem
known for his loyal support ol t'10
existing Governments. He fought his
fall, and when Diaz was no longer
chief executive Iluerta fought for
Francisco de la Barra, the Provisional
President. Afer Francisco
Madero was elected Iluerta found it
to be his duty t? support one who
had so long fought as a rebel. His
loyalty was not challenged until the
Felix Diaz revolution in Mexico
City in Febuary, 1913, when the
Madero Government was completely
overthrown and Iluerta hmself elevated
t? the Presidency.
Iluerta devoted himself to the
unitary i?rrer uj; 11 very eariy age.
Born at Chihuahua in 1854, he en
tered at Military Academy of C'hapultepe
at the aKe of 17 and passed
through the full course to graduation
in 1875, when he was commissioned
second lieutenant of engineers.
During his academic term
he was known for his predilection
astronomy and niathematic.
During the ensuing years Huerta
saw much active service. In 1901
he left the staff and took command
of the infantry in the campaign
against tho Yaqui Indians. After
this cmpalgn he was again put in
charge of the General Staff's t?I'?
graphical work in Sonora. He par
11C1 PHI<M1 in suusequent raqui campaings
and also in the campaign in
Yucatan against the Maya Indians.
As a reward for his Indian service
Huerta was given the rank of bri^u
dier-general and once more detaailed
to the General StafT.
Huerta command all the detach'
ed Government forces in the State
I of Guerrcra at the beginnig of the
I Madero revolution. When Madero
| acceeded to the Presidency, General
[ Huerta was sent back into Morclos
with a force to put down the Zapai
t? rebellion. As a result ?' ill-feel
! ing growing out ?f this campaign
Huerta was recalled. Subsequently
he led the army aginsf Ornzo and
was in command at the batt'Hacliimba.
For this s?rvico he was
promoted fo Major-general. He was
given leave of absence because of an

Tariff and Hank,tug ltefoju^s..
Washington, Jan. 11.?Senator ?.
\*ewlands, of Nevada, attacked his
party's record in the senate today,
lelivering a long prepared speech
n which he criticized the tariff and
milking reforms?the chief legisla- fl
ive achievement of the Wilson administration.
He declared that
because there had been industrial
ind commercial depression during
Democratic control of legislation, the
jarty would be in danger of defeat j
it the next presidential election un-1 i
ess the European war continued I a
ind made the president's "sagaciously
uid firm" handling of foreign affairs j
:he overshadowing issue. t
Although he characterized tlie I i
general trend of Democratic legis-'t
Lion as commendable, the senator as 1
serted that the party was too radl- i
;al and expressed the conviction that , ;
'no political party can hope to re- (
main in power which adopts radicall I
Instead of evolutionary methods of t
reform. ! i
Danger of a Democratic defeat in '
the congressional elections of l!tl4, !
lie said was averted only by the Hu- 1
rnpean war, which brought into sud- :
len contrast the president's policy of
watchful waiting regarding Mexico '
which made that policy as popular
as it had heretofore been unpopular.; '
"The realization that similar pin-' 1
l.>nce would keep us out of K a rnpean ^
complications, he added, "saved the '
party at the last election from the 1
defeat which would have surely come |
is the result of the general prostra- 1
tion of business. noDularlv attrihut.-! <

"It would not do to charge this to ! ?
the European war. first, because that 1
war, though injurious to our produc- t
tion and trade in? its inception has|<
since become a stimulant to produc. 1
tion and export, and second, because 1
the commencement of this depres- ?
sion ante-dates the European war i
arjd was contemporaneous with ouri*
legislation regarding the tariff, <

that he wrote a long answer to th<?l i

did this in November.

As for the responsibility or Carranza
for the tragedy the secretary
feels that a question of fact remians
to be established.
Secretary Lansing let lt he
known that he considers there is a (
certain analogy between the situa
tion prevailing in certain parts of '
Mexico and that which prevailed 1
In certain parts of the West during i
the early history of the United
States. It was also pointed out that
there were many instances where
the citizens of one country had lost
their lives in another during insur- 1
rections or of mob outbreaks which
the authorites were unable to control

made. i
