Supposed Cecession of
Hostilities.
SITUATION IS
MORE DESPERATE
Little Nation is being Crush
ed, Though Invaders Ad
vance Slowly.
ienna, Jan. 14—The cap
ture of Cettinje, capital of
Montenegro, which has been
under the domination of the
Austrian guns several days,
has been occupied by the
Austrian forces, according
to official announcement
made today.
The announcement seems
to preclude the possibility of
any armistice, as recently
reported, being in effect be
tween the two armies.
Reported Attack on
Saloniki Not Launched
Ijondon, Jan. 14.—It is authorita
tively announced that the. reported
offensive of the Teutonic allies against
Saloniki did not occur. Rumors that
mi attack had been begun against the
forces of the allies apparently origin
ated In the activity of the French in
blowing up bridges connecting Salon
iki with the road over which the at
ackers would normally travel.
The bridges destroyed by the
French are not only at Demirhissar,
iin the Struma, in the neighborhood
of Serres, but also at Kilindir, south
of Doiran. All bridges destroyed are
in Greek territory.
Rumors that Austria and Monte
negro have suspended hostilities for
the purpose of discussing arrange
ments whereby further warfare on
Montenegrin soil would be stopped,
may be based simply on the fact that
the Austrian advance In Montenegro
has become so slow that suspicion of
suspension of hostilities is naturally
aroused.
Many military critics, however, are
of the opinion that Montenegro Is now
in such position that some form of
arrangement with her adversary has
become Imperative.
Separate Peace is
Being Negotiated
London. Jan. 14.—A wireless dis
patch from Rome, reiterating the re
port of an armistice between Austria
and Montenegro, states that it was
Austria which proposed the cessation
of hostilities, with the purpose of ne
gotiating separate peace.

Greater New York during 1915, ac
cording to figures compiled by the

terday were $5,757,015, which was

he break off his "attachment for the
woman who so far has made our lives

Huerta May Be
Buried in Mexico
Has Been 111 Several Wcclm—History
of This Most Remarkable Man
Who Brought Bitter Strife.
HI I'aso, Tex., Jan. 14.—General
Victorlano Huerta, former provisional
president of Mexico, died here last
night.
General Huerta, who succeeded
General Francisco I. Madero in exe
cutive power in Mexico City, and later
left Mexico, died of Sclerosis of the
liver. He was surrouuded by his
family when the end came. His death
was not unexpected. Funeral arrange
ments are to be made today. It is be
lieved an effort will be made to ar
range his burial in Mexico.
Huerta took office as Provisional
President on February 19, 1913.
Three days afterward Francisco Ma
dero, one of his brothers who had
been arrested with him, and Jose
Maria Pino Snares, vice president un
der Madero, were assassinated while
riding under guard from the palace to
the penitentiary.
This crime aroused a storm of in
dignation throughout the United
States. In many, quarters there were
demands for intervention but presi
dent Ta/t, who was on the eve of
leaving .office, decided to take no ac
tion which might commit the incom
ing administration of President Wil
son.
Immediately on assuming office
President Wilson refused to recognize
Huerta as the head of the Mexican
government In spite of the fact that
such recognition had been granted by
Great Britain. At the same time the
^iaderistas rallied under Venustiano
Carranza. governor of Coahuila, and
Francisco Villa- declared against
Huerta.
Following the refusal of President
Wilson to recognise the provisional
president. United States Ambassador
Henry. Lane Wilson was recalled from
Mexico City. The situation between
the Unite.1 States and Mexico then re
mained at a practical deadlock until
August when -President Wilson sent
John Lind former governor of Min
nesota, to the Mexican capital as his
personal representative. Mr. Und
presented certain proposals to Huer
ta, chief of which was that the pro
visional president should resign and
permit a national election at which he
would not be a candidate, Huerta per
emptorily
rejected
these proposals.

Washington, Jan. 14. Senator
Cummins of Iowa, republican, todav
introduced bills calling for the in
crease of the national guard to peace
strength of 400,000, and war strength
of 800,000. Three year enlistments,
three times the camn meneuver and

of the bills.
"The National Guard, as have
proposed to reorganize it," said Cum

a trained army that can be much
more quickly mobilized and that will
be much better trained than the pro

No Martial Law Has
Been Proclaimed
Washington, Jan. 1 4 —Secretary
Garrison said he had no advices that
martial law has been proclaimed in
El Paso and pointed out that the army
probably is aiding civil authorities of
the city only in maintaining order by
using the provost guard to control
troopers about the city.
Brigadier General Pershing, he
said, had no power to intervene un
less a situation of International char
acter is influenced by physiclal acts
from beyond the border.
If any citizen of El Paso sought
vengance upon a Mexican there for
an act committed in Mexico, he add
ed. it did not constitute an interna
tional situation, but a violation of the
local law of Texas, subject to state
authorities only.
Even should the state authorities
find themselves unable to maintain
order, the secretary added, an appeal
would have to be made by the gover
nor to the president and formal au
thorization be issued at Washington
before martial law could be declared.
Provost patrol has been maintained
by army authorities to aid the police
in keeping soldiers In order. It has
power only over troopers and even
they are responsible to city authori
ties for any infraction of local laws.
