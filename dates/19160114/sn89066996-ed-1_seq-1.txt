LESSONS ESSENTIAL
TO LIFE'S SUCCESS
Address of Rev. 0. H. Duggins to the
Students of Ozark Business
College Epitomized
Everyone wants to succeed. Ev
eryone should have ambition to make
his life count. But what constitutes
anccess. When we speak of successful
business men, we uually think of his
having a fat bank account or a great
.Heal of valuable property, and say of
4at man that he has been successful.
It is well to acquire wealth. Wealth
is power. Almost every enterprise
alls for material support. We can
nSe money to great advantage. But
. the life a success .hat makes mon
ey an idol, bows down to it, ojad lets
it have monopoly. Some men of
wealth do little or nothing to alleviate
itie suffering and hardships of their
fellow men.
It is a splendid thing to have learn
in);, to store these minds of ours with
e treasures of knowledge. It en
larges our sphere of usefulness. We
ought not to neglect it. But some of
rlie most learned people in history
idve been morally and spiritually
profligate.
In considering the subject of suc
ess, one must give it a large scope,
and then, my friends, if wo must
achieve success in this world we must
!earn to value time; learn to treas
ure time as the most valuable commo
dity wo possess. Of course, the past
of our lives is a sealed book. It is
impossible for us to change a thought
or deed in our past lives. The only
jood In dwelling on the past is the
lessons we can learn from it, and thus
make our past mistakes "stepping
stones" for the future. The present
is the only time we have 1n which to
labor. Write in the present, and this
writing is our life history and deter
mines our destiny. Time is n very
valuable thing, the most valuable
commodity with which we have to
deal. We must learn to treasure our
time. The expression, "Making up
for lost time," is an impossibility. A
great deal of time is wasted in allow
ing little rfagments of time to go un
improved, f
The bane of our existence is indo
Mrs, Sarah Cnnningnani
a Centenarian April 9th
April 9, 1916, Mrs. Sarah Cunning
ham will be 101 years cf age. She was
norn in Henderson county, KyM in
1815, where she spent the first eight
or ten years of her life. About the
year 1824 her parents migrated to
Missouri and settled in this county.
Mrs. Cunningham's maiden name was
Gibson and she was so known during
her early years in this neighborhood.
Her name was applied to the cem
etery west of Flat River, known as
the Gibson Cemetery. No doubt
many persons have frequently won
dered why this cemetery has been
so named.
Some years after her arrival to
:his county she was married to a man
named Banister. After his death she
was married to Mr. Cunningham. She
lias three children living, all girls:
Mrs. John Noyes of Gumbo; Mrs.
Frank Bradley of St. Francois, and
Mrs. Henry Laws of Bismarck.
She is quite hale for a person of
such extreme age and has promise of
living to see a few more returns of
her natal day. She is a member of
the Church of God of which she has
been a faithful member for several
years. Mrs. Cunningham has resid
ed in this vicinity ever since she came
to this State, living within ten miles
of Elvins all her life, except the few
years she spent in Kentucky in her
childhood days. Gibson graveyard is
a part of the old family homestead,
hence the name of this burial ground.
It is an honor to Missouri and St.
Francois county that persons within
these confines live to such extreme
age, and speaks volumes for health
fulness of this section of the State.
It is our sincere hope that Mrs. Cun
ningham will be permitted to enjoy
and celebrate several more birthdays
before Time closes its pages to seal
the record of a worthy life. Elvins

lence, physical, mental and spiritual.
It is altogether possible for us to be
active in one set of our faculties and
be idle in another. It is a very com
mon mistake for us to not do certain
tasks because they are not to our lik
ing. We fail to take hold and to dis
charge the duty at hand.
Thoroughness in all our tasks is es
sential. We ought to give the task in
hand the benefit of the very best tal
ent we possess. There is no more im
portant habit to acquire than the hab
it of doing thoroughly and conscien
tiously every task. Be satisfied when
you quit it that it has received the
best in you. We have a high incen
tive by example all about us, in the
air, water and in the earth. It is the
silent forces of nature at work which,
like their creator, never slumber or
sleep. The rate at which the earth
and myriads of other worlds arc en
circling their suns, should excite ev
ery creature in the universe to ac
tivity. One of the great things we have to
do in life is to get self-mastery. If
we give way to fits of temper, of de
spondency, instead of being strcmg
and victorious spirits within, we shall
be- crabid, unlovely and outward fail
ures. It takes patient self-control for
us to combat exposure of temper or
despondence.
I would mention in conclusion as
absolutely essential to the development
of a noble character of the highest
type of success the motives that ac
tuate us in our life work. We must
have high motives in the prosecution
of our tasks, what we can accomplish
for our fellow man. The world about
us must have a spirit that takes in
the interest o fthe whole community.
I do not believe it possible for anyone
to lead a worthy life and be the contin
ual recipient of high heaven and not
acknowledge God in his life. He is
stamped with base ingratitude. You
must recognize the claim of the Al
mighty upon you, and of humanity up
on you, and not have selfish, but un
selfish motives.
W, J. Hobbs Resigns as
Manager of B. T. F. & C. Co.
January first it was announced that
W. J. Hobbs, veterian manager of the
farm work of the Bonne Terrc Farm
ing and Cattle Company would be re
tired on a pension and his place would
be taken by a younger man, a gradu
ate of an agricultural school.
Mr. Hobbs came here from Iron
dale, Washington county, in 188fi, he
having made a notable success of the
farming operations of the Choteau-Harrison-Valley
Company.
The same zeal, industry, sobriety
and calm judgment that marked the
success of Mr. Hobbs at Irondale char
acterized his work here in his new
position and he has been known as a
faithful, conscientious worker.
We learn that he is retired on a
pension as so many of the older men
here have been.
The place made vacant by Mr.
Hobbs, we understand, is to be filled
by a Mr. Nesbitt, who comes from In
diana, and who is a graduate of the
agricultural school of the Illinois State
University at Urbana, 111.
Mr. Nesbitt will bring to the work
youth and earnestness, the very lat
est in farm education and practical
experience.
Wo have for some time understood
in a general way that the purpose of
the company was in a way at least to
specialize on pure-bred stock and in
tensive farming. Bonne Terre Star.
OELSER JONES
H. M. Oelser and Miss Ellen Jones,
both of Doe Run vicinity, were mar
ried in Farmington Tuesday, January
11, 1916, Justice Wm. Good tying the
gordion knot. The bride is the daugh
ter of Mr. M. Jones and the groom
the son of Mr. Peter Oelser, -mho are
among our best people. The Times
joins with their many friends in wish
ing these popular young people a real
ization of their fondest anticipations.
His Friends
Are Insistent
The Satte gathering of Democrats
in St. Louis last Saturday was one of
the most representative gatherings
that has been held within the State
for several years, was a generally ex
pressed sentiment. We know that
hundreds of the faithful were gath
ered there, and that they came from
all sections of the State. While many
had favorites in the field for different
State offices, over whom they could
effuse with little or no effort, gener
ally speaking, as we found and figur
ed the present situation, there is but
little crystalizing of sentiment in fa
vor of anyone aside from Woodrow
Wilson, who, as someone has express
ed it, has "a great Wood-row" al
ready stacked up for the next cam
paign. The Times editor noticed one thing,
however, in regard to the Congression
al situation in the Thirteenth Dis
trict, and that was many and strong
impressions in favor of Prof. G. W.
Moothart of this city getting his
hat into the ring for that office, hing
ing alone on the theory that Congress
man Hensley would not be a candidate
to succeed himself. As to whether
or not Congressman Hensley desires
or intends to make the race for re
election, there appears to be more or
less doubt. No one seems to know
to a certainty what his intentions are
in this matter, and The Times has had
absolutely no information indicating
whether or not he would attempt to
succeed himself.
This situation has very naturally
put many "up in the air", and they
are beginning to feel that if Congress
man Hensley desires to succeed him
self, it is now time for him to make
his wants known. In, the meantime,
the pressure that was brought to bear
upon Prof. Moothart in St. Louis last
Saturday indicated that his entrance
into the Congressional race would be
received with much acclaim in every
county in the District. These many
expressions were at least highly
commendatory to Prof. Moothart, be
ing calculated to fire the ambition of
anyone.

County Well
Represented
St. Francois county was well rep
resented at the Jackson Day banquet,
which was given at the Planters Ho
tel in St. Louis, last Saturday night,
under the auspices of the 28th Ward
Democratic Club of that city. The
gathering was said to be the most rep
resentative, from a party standpoint,
that had been assembled within the
State for many years past. The very
spirit of the gathering seemed to
breathe success for the Democrats at
the next election.
In fact it was a gathering such as
now seems most essential in order to
uphold the somewhat desponding
spirits of Democrats in that city, who
appear to be sadly afflicted with "cold
feet." What they stood most in need
of was more "pep," and The Times is
of the opinion that a few more such
gatherings as that of last Saturday
will stimulate them up to a fighting
mood that cannot be overcome. And
when he Democrats of St. Louis be
come thoroughly aroused they simply
can not be whipped, though they may
be, for a time, overcome.
It was refreshing to note so many
good Democrats from St. Francois
county at this splendid meeting,
among whom the writer noticed the
following: Dr. Frank Keith of Flat
River, C. E. Porter of Desloge, W. L.
Bouchard of The Desloge Sun, Geo.
K. Williams, B. H. Marbury, Prof.
G. W. Moothart, Dr. W. G. Patton, J.
C. Watson, Francis A. Benham, Lau

EXPRESSION OF GOOD
WILL AND ESTEEM
Employes of St. Joseph Lead Company
Present Sup't Ross Blake
With Gold Watch
Last Saturday evening at the Club
House in Leadwood, there was mani
fested a degree of friendship that
rarely exists between employe and
employer. Mr. Ross Blake has been
superintendent of the St. Joe Lead '
Company for a number of years, and
by his industry and honesty, his kind
and considerate treatment, and his un
tiring energy and faithfulness to duty,
has won from his employes their
highest confidence and esteem; and
for his active interest in school and
church work, and whatever has been
for the welfare and happiness of
Leadwood has a warm place in the
hearts of her people. As an expres
sion of the friendship of his employes
they presented him a beauttiful gold
watch and chain bearing the inscrip
Hon, "From the Employes of the St. ;
Joe Lead Company to Mr. Ross Blake,
their Superintendent, January 1, j

Musical Recital (Bond Loses
to Be Given Soon; Damage Suit
A recital is to be given on the 24th, I
at the Presbyterian Church in Farm- j
ington, by Miss Ida Louise Miller, j
ocntralto, of St. Louis, assisted by
Mrs. Forsyth, organist, Mr. Hugh Por
ter, violinist, and Mr. Charles Fran
cisco, barytone.
Thtse Yirtko-fcan Always he. depend
ed upon to give a thoroughly artistic
performance, and the recital arrang
ed for this occasion includes music of
more than usual merit.
Miss Miller has won a deserved rep
utation in St. Louis and elsewhere as
a singer of far more than average
ability, with a sure technique admir
ably displaying a rich contralto voice
of uncommon warmth and power. A
pupil of the famous Gwylim Miles of
New York, and others, she has a mas
tery of the vocal art which is sure to
be immensely pleasing.
Mrs. Forsyth is well known to the
Farmington public and ranks as the
most thoroughly artistic organist in
this part of Missouri.
Mr. Porter has so frequently de
lighted audiences here, during his
five years' successful work as I teach
er of violin, that no comment is need
ed to assure those who attend this
recital of genuine pleasure in hearing
him again.
Mr. Francisco likewise is well and
favorably known locally as a singer
of ability and experience, whose work
is always well received and vastly
pleasing. ,
There will be no admission charged,
and all who attend are assured a
thoroughly enjoyable musical treat,
far superior to the usual affairs of
this kind which Farmington music
lovers have opportunity to hoar. The
date selected is Monday evening, Jan
uary 24th, at 8 o'clock. The program
will be published in full next week.
Unclaimed Deposits
Under Section 21 of the new bank
ing law, which became effective March
25, 1915, State Bank Examiner J. T.
Mitchell caused to be published in the
metropolitan papers of the State a
complete list of all unclaimed deposits
in the banks of the State which have
been inactive for five years or more.
There are 700 different accounts, rang
ing from $5 to over $8,000, which are
unclaimed and the depositors' abodes
and addresses unknown to the differ
ent banks. This is the first publica
tion of these deposits, but hereafter,
every five years, on the fifth Wed
nesday of January, all banks will be
required to publish these unclaimed
accounts.
In looking over the list of unclaim
ed deposits we notice that the Bank
of Farmington of this city has the
following: Cora A. Aubuchon, $100;
L. J. Dorton, $156.25; Mrs. K. F. Kru
goff, $100.02; J. H. Semar's Estate,
S95.67; J. L. Snyder, $72.
J. C. Jadwin said In presenting tba
watch, that the gift had neither been
sought nor thought of by the recipi
ent, but was the manifestation of the
friendly feeling growing out of the
pleasant relations between employer
and employe. Mr. Blake, after re
gaining his composure, thanked them
for the beautiful gift, and said words
failed to express his appreciation,
that it was not because of its intrinsic
value that he prizedt so highly, bat
because of the spirit of friendship
that had prompted it; that he had tried
at all times to be just to his employes,
and if he had not been it was an er
ror of the head and not of the heart;
and that, if at any time in the future
he could be of service to them, alt
they had to do was to command him.
Again he thanked them for the valued
gift and wished them great success.
This is the feeling that ought to ex
ist between the employer and the em
ploye. J. C. JADWIN.
The damage suit of Attorney Ster
ling Bond of St. Louis against L. H.
Williams, Cashier of the Farmers
Bank, B. H. Marbury and George K.
Williams for $15,000 damages for an
alleged conspiracy to assault and beat
him, was tried before Jud'v Anderson
in Jiivuian No. i utnt St. Lamia
Circiut Court last Monday and Tues
day, resulting in a verdict of not
guilty to all the defendants.
In the trial of the McBrien case
in the Circuit Court at Farmington
last spring, Bond was attorney for
McBrien, and in his address to the
jury was very abusive of L. H. Wil
liams, who was one of the plaintiffs
in the case, of Mr. Marbury, one of
his attorneys, and of others, who were
witnesses against McBrien. The
abusive language of Bond was highly'
resented, and afterwards on the street
L. H. Williams walked up to Bond,
knocked him down and gave him a
sound thrashing, a proceeding that
was applauded by all who knew of
the circumstances and declared that
Mr. Williams gave him just what he
deserved.
The trial, which was called last
Monday, was closed on Tuesday, and
the jury were out only about ten min
utes, when they returned a verdict
acquitting the defendants, leaving
Mr. Bond to pay the costs and nurse
his outraged dignity. Lee Merri
wether conducted the case for Bond,
and Charles Hay of St. Louis and B.
H. Boyer of Farmington appeared for
the defendants.
Among those from Farmington who
attended the trial as witnesses were
"Uncle" King Williams, County Col
lector Croke, Thos. H. Stam, former
Prosecuting Attorney Francis A. Ben
ham and P. A. Shaw.
Another Candidate
lor State Auditor
Mr. Sam J. McMinn of Bollinger
county, one of the members of the
Board of Managers of State Hospital
No. 4, was a caller last week. Mr.
McMinn has decided to make the race
for the Democratic nomination for
State Auditor.
Mr. McMinn is well known in South,
cast Missouri as a man of sterling
qualities and an up-to-the-minute
Democrat. He was Clerk of the Cir
cuit Court of Bollinger county for
eight years, served four years as a
member of the State Democratic
Committee, was formerly engaged in
the banking business, and is now pur
suing the even tenor of his way on a
farm near Buchanan, Bollinger coun
ty. His wide acquaintance in this sec
tion of the State and the many friends
he has throughout Southeast Missou
ri bespeak for him an encouraging
support in his aspirations.
