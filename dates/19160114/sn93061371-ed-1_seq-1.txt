We ship away our hard earn

promising: ,
"Now, Hetty, chirk tif. at! f a good
girl) Bhd joit shall feed bur Sorrel."
Now, .jhijlrihrh, sht f isftof
at tho old house agliiii'. .fh fal ,a
lively remembrance of ihat c'Atilt
room, and was det'rmjied to ovsi1
haul It if given half a chance. She
dwelt upon the loea ao constantly
Hint she came to bel.'eve that some
wheYe tit that. feolletlon Of musty
fclits (if tht pjlst thrr lay eoticcaled
a document wfili.K -6nid .brin a
treasure to Us finder. She evert f'
tured herself standing before her
startled old cousins, document In
hand, this announcement on her lips:
"My (U'ur cousins, I have found a
great treasure."
One day, whlUj waiting her (JppOF-'
tunlty to explore the garret, a young
men known to the Bisters called on
an errand for lilS mother and was In
troduced to Miss Betty as SIC' Ftr
Kirkwood. The following day whll
she was out for a walk, he turned
up as If by accident. This happened
ngaln on the third day, and on the
fourth he forgot to offer an excuse
for its rather marked rectlff Phefl.
Ylthlti a week It had happened sJ
frequently that neither saw anything
unconventional In the matter.
This rapidly developing arpwilnt;
ance did not escape the vigilant eyeV
of the cousins. One day the elder
sister observed frankly:
"f suppose I ought to warn you
against love at first sight."
"ii'tl fM y6ii nevcf loved at first
sight or second sight or any other
sight, how can you, Cousin PhoGbtf?''
At this the gentle old woman1
sniijed, feebly.
'.Ford Krkwood Is a fine young
man, but he has no moil??," ih went
on dutifully. '
"Nor have I. I pjiall not fall in love,
dear cousin. I shall net elope. - I shall
never marry at least not until "
"t:htil when, Betty r
''t'ntii i find a 'treasure," declared
the girl as If she meant it. In bef
soul she believed there was a treas
ure. V) that garret. She felt like de
manding ttie pflTllcg of, exploration,
but still she bided her time. ,
Her opportunity came suddenly.
There came a day when the sisters',
were called away on a matter of busi
ness which demanded their personal
attention.
"1 fini so afraid Jou tvilt be lonely,',
Jiaid the elder sister sympathetically.
'.'We shall be away bt least threi
hours."
"Ob, no; I can take a long" llc
and then read awhile after coming
back," said Hetty, trying hard to keep
har voice steady.
Scarcely was tho vehicle bearing
the sisters out of sight when Betty
ft' td tti garret. Ouce within the
ferbidden treasure iifeiis she Stood
for a long five minutes feasting hef
eyes. Then she selected the oldest
iid most battered trunk of the en
tire lot for Inspection. ....
Letters and documents? tthy; the
trunk was full to repletion with them.
There were deeds, mortgages, re
ceipts, bills of sale, private letters,
grants and what not, and the girl had
Only a glimmering cf what had once
been thplr legal Value. Three hours
had gone by and the return of the
sisters nilijht te expected at any fhu"
Itient when she selected a parchment
almost at random, replaced tho oth
ers In the trunk and left the fascinat
ing spot.
"Xobody but an old pirate could
have written a hand like that, and of
course if he was a pirate he must
have written about a treasure. 1
shall ask Mr. Kirkwood to help to
Unravel It." .
When he saw It Ford Kirkwood
agreed with Butty that It was the
Work of an eld pirate, but he ad
hiitted frai:kly ,that he web not an
adept at deciphering hieroglyphics.
"It will htsve to be done," said
Bety, determinedly, "before before
. .
"Why not postpone It until "
"Until?"
"Until after we are married," he
finished hercicaljy.
,. "But I have promised Cousin
t'hoebe I shall never marry until. J
have found a treasure," she bald with
a great attempt to be serious. '
"Well, haven't you found me?" hi
suggested brazenly. "And I have,
found you the most precious treas
ure of all," be added gallantly.
