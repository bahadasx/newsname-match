Gratefully Received.
The following letter to Miss llor
tense Dungan from Mrs. Campbell, of
St. Joseph, Is self-explanatory.
"St Joseph, Mo., Jan. 10, l'.U't.
"Dear Miss Diingaii: Your letter
enclosing draft for twenty dollars add
thirty-live cents (KMXi) for the Shelt
ering Arms Home received. As you
have corresponded with me for a long
time, and assisted In. so many ways In
this beautiful work you can Imagine
how happy I am. Through the kind
nes.s of the merchants hure, bolh
wholesale and retail, so much can bn
done for that amount of money At
the present time there are .'HI children
In the Home, and 14 of them are
under two years of uge. It Is a sight
never to be forgotten. The condition
of the majority of these children when
they came Into the Hume, ecu
trasted with their healthy, happy ap
pearance after they have been there
awhile makes our hearts rejoice. So
many visit the Home and are a lie.; ted
to tears, but 1 do not feel that way
for 1 am so glad to know they have a
place where they can be clean and
happy. Will you express to the mem
bers of the Kndless Chain and all who
have helped In this work our heartfelt
appreciation of this gift, but, while
we are so glad to thank the donors
they will have a greater reward In the
warmth and thrilling of their own
hearts when they think that they
have helped these little ones to love
home and happiness. I shall be only
to glad to answer any questloniln ref
erenca to the work at any time,
With kindest regards ana oesl wishes
to you and all who have shown such a
lovely spirit towards the children of
llie liome. i remain
Yours vary truly
