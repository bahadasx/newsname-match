MEXICO'S
Administration Will No. urder Troops Across Mexican line
At This Time-Senator Stone, of Foreign Relations
Committee of Opinion
tunity to Clear Country
Martial Law While Mexican
Washington, Jan. 14. No American troops will be
sent across the Mexican border at this time, it was clearly
indicated today following a half hour conference this
lorenoon between President
of the senate foreign committee.
The senator called at the White house to get President
Wilson's advice as to the foreign committee's course to
ward Mexican resolutions. He did not indicate what the
chief executive desired with regard to the Senator Lewis
resolution, but he asserted strongly that there will be no
invasion of Mexico now.
Obviously the administration wants to give General
Carranza an opportunity to gather tip the loose ends of
the disorder still existing in portions of Mexico, before
the United States shall hamper him.
"Carranza cannot be expected to do this in a day,"
commented Stone.
Carranza Says He's Busy.
Washington, Jan. 14. General Carranza today sent a
message to Mexican Ambassador Arredondo that the
murderers of the American party in Chihuahua are be
ing pursued, and that they will "meet condign punish
ment.'' From this message, the administration saw substantia
tion of its view that Carranza is doing all he can to meet
American demands and. to-guard against recurrences of
the Santa Ysabel massacre. In these circumstances, the
government is inclined to await developments. And as
indicated by Senator Stone today, the administration has
no intention of now hampering Carranza's efforts by en
gaging in intervention.
Great Britain Wants to Know.
Washington, Jan. 14. The British embassy is prepar
ing to ask the state department for information as to the
administration's intended action in Mexico, it was learned
today.
British Ambassador Holder at Mexico City reported
to the embassy that a British subject was killed recently
in Chihuahua and that strikers elsewhere have been
damaging British property.
The situation from a British standpoint is made more
difficult because there is practically no government in
Mexico City to which Holder can appeal. On the other
hand, having recognized Carranza, Great Britain hesi
tated to appeal to the United States in the situation.
Holder reported that the Mexican foreign secretary
had joined Carranza, leaving Mexico City without a
responsible chief official.
T'.l Ilaso, Texan, Jan. 14. While tho

Here is tho preparedness program of the

out:
The United States must have
a strong navy, fully manned, of
forty-eight dreadiiaughts, and
battle cruisers in proportion. The
necessary number of scouts,
destroyers, and sea-going sub
marines should balance the capi
tal fleet; also auxiliaries, colliers,
repair ships, tenders and other
necessary crafe. Ships should bo
laid down immediately,
The United States must have a
standing army of 200,000 men and.
45,000 officers, backed by a na
tional force of citizens trained in
' arms under a universal and obliga
tory system. This body should be
of no less strength than 2,000,000
men, fully equipped and with a
large reserve Bupply of artillery
and ammunition.
This shall be America's insur
ance against war, against inva
sion, against foreign flag over '

which makes the Monroe Doc
trine a living fact. And this
shall be the tine meaning of pre
paredness. Half-measures are
useless and a waste of money.

said tho colonel. "I was three years in

made any better fight than any of the
members of the national guurd "who

A national guard must (be what the

Tho colonel' paid his respocts to
the order of Secretary Dajiicls forbid
ding naval officers to mnKe speeches on
preparedness.
"This society," said Col. Roose

LIVE INCIDENT OF

By Cliarles P. Stewart.

Tho Hague, .Tun. 14. A wild scene
iu which several leaders of tho Ford
jx-aco expedition exchanged blows at
Oliristiania took place before Henry
Ford sped by outo to catch n train for
Kergen in order to make his bout for
America. Information from a trust-
worthy sourco today revealed tho "in-'
sido story" of events aboard tho Oscar
11 at Cliristiuma. It was learned that
Ford first investigated Mmo. Hchwim
mcr's claims that she had documents
from belligerent nnd neutral rulers, en
couraging the Ford peace move, after
there had been a quarrel aboard over
President Wilson's preparedness pro
gram. Ford found that the documents
were politely phrased declarations of
nothing, and that they were entirely
worthless.
fiadly disnppoiuted at this turn of
affairs, 'Ford retired to his cabin, in
mortification, under tho pretense thnt
ho was ill. Ho remained practically
incommunicado for tho remainder of the
trip, Ho still hoped that an entliusins

give him somo chance for success of
the expedition. But when the Norweg
