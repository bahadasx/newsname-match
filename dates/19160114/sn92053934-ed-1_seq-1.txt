DEATHVICTI
Huerta Dies at His Home in
Texas After Long and
Severe Illness.
INTERNATIONAL FIGURE
During Term as Provisional
President He Attracted
World-Wide Attention
El Paso, Texas, Jan. 14. Funeral
arrangements for Genera! Victoriano
Huerta, former provisional president
of Mexico, who died here last night
after a lingering illness, were being
completed today.
It is probable, relatives said, that
the veteran Mexican general would be
buried in Mexico, the tend of his birth,
and from which he was an exile.
El Paso, Texas, Jan. 14. Huerta,
once provisional president of Mexico,
was 72 years of age. He had been
111 for nearly six months, his illness
first became marked soon after hi3 in
carceration as a federal prisoner at
Fort Bliss last July. Attending phy
sicians attributed death to a compli
cation of liver complaints, which
caused a gen ral breakdown.
When the general's condition be
came alarming he was transferred
from Fort Bliss to his home in El
Paso. Federal guards were with
withdrawn and $15,000 bond asked by
the government for the appearance of
General Huerta on a charge of vio
lating the neutrality law was waived.
General Huerta died in full posses
sion of his faculties and surrounded
by the members of his family and a
number of close personal friends,
most of whom were members of his
staff, in the days of former glory.
Was a Professional .Soldier.
General Victoriano Huerta was a
professional soldier, and as such he
had, up to the overthrow of President
Francisco Madero, been known lor his
loyal support of the existing govern
ments. He fought loyally for Presi
dent Porfiro Diaz until his fall, and
Then Diaz was no longer chief execu
tive, Huerta fought for Francisco de '
la Barra, the provisional president.
After Francisco Madero was elected
Huerta found it to be his duty to sup
port one who had so long fought as a
rebel. His loyalty was not challenged
until the Felix Diaz revolution in Mex
ico City In February, 1913, when the
Madero government was completely
overthrown and Huerta himself ele
vated to the presidency.
Huerta devoted himself to a mili
tary career at a very early age. Born
at Chihuahua in 1844, he entered the
Military Academy of Chapultepec at
the age of 17 and passed through the
full course to graduation in 1875, when
he was commissioned second lieuten
ant of engineers. During his acad
emic term he was known for his pre
dilection for scientific studies, par
ticularly astronomy and mathematics.
When Porfirio Diaz began his reor
ganization of the Mexican army
Huerta was promoted captain of en
gineers and while holding this rank
devised the plan for a Mexican gen
eral staff corps. He was an active
members of the military map commis
sion created to draft a staff map of
Mexico on a Jarge scale and he had
charge of all the astronomical work
of the commission's leading exploring
and surveying parties over the wild
est regions of the republic.
Won .Steady Promotion.
During the ensuing years Huerta
saw much active service. In 1901 he
left the staff and took command of the
infantry in the caiaign against the
Yaqul Indians. After this campaign

SOLDIER REMOVED
FROMSTEAMERBY
A BRITISHflFFICER
New York, Jan. 14. Albert Clark, a
private in the Fifth United SXates In
fantry, was removed from the steam
ship Santa Marta at Jamaica by a Brit
ish neutrality officer, according to pas
sengers who arrived here today. After
being detained ashore several hours,
Clark was allowed to return to the ship
and proceed here.
This is said to be the first time a
United States soldier has been remov
ed under similar conditions from an
American vessel since the war of 1812.
Clark, who had served 19 months
in the canal zone, was proceeding to
Washington to report to the adjutant
general, and was in full uniform when
he was removed from the Santa Marta,
which flies the American" flag.
When the steamer stopped at Ja
maica, en route from Colon to New
York, a British . neutrality officer
boarded the vessel and questioned all
passengers as to their nationality.
Clark said he was born near Vienna
but had taken out his first American
citizenship papers some time ago.
The neutrality officer left the ship
and shortly afterward, passengers
said, three negro soldiers boarded the
Santa Marta and told Clark to accom
pany them ashore. Clark said he was
closely questioned by commanding of
ficers. While he was absent, Ameri
can passengers on the Santa Marta
decided to appeal to the American
consul, but before this could be done,
Clark returned.
Clark said he would make a report
of the incident to the war department.
PROSSIA PAPERS
ARE DISSATISFIED
Berlin, Jan. 14, (via London, 1:15 a.
m.) The Vorwaerts expresses dissat
isfaction with that portion of the
speech from the throne delivered yes
terday at the opening of the Prussian
diet which refers to the reform of the
Prussian franchise. The other papers
are guarded in their comments except
ing the Tageblatt, which declares
openly its dissatisfaction. The sen
tence regarding franchise reform, says
the Tageblatt demands of the people
"a far-reaching renunciation."
The other papers either are satis
fled that more cannot be expected at
the present time, or like the Tages
Zeitung and Kreuz Zeitung and one
or two other papers of the extreme
radical faction, fear the promise goes
too far.
Excepting the Tageblatt, the radical
papers which before the war were
loudest in demanding the franchise, do
not spaak a word of adverse criticism.
The anticipated reference to fran
chise reform was expressed in the
speech from the throne, delivered by
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Prus
sian prime minister, In indefinite
phrases as something to be expected
after the war, owing to the harmony
and mutual respect developed in the
j Prussian nation by the trials of

MOST WIN, EDICT
OF RUSSIAN CZAR
London, Jan. 14. Reuter's Petro
grad correspondent says that Emper
or Nicholas, in an imperial order to
the Russian army and navy on the
occasion of the Russian New Year's
day, proclaimed that there can be no
peace without victory. The order
follows:
"The year 1913 has passed and it
was filled with memorable instances
of sacrifices by my glorious forces.
In a hard struggle with an enemy,
strong in numbers and rich in all re
sources, they have harassed that en
emy and checked his invasion, their
breasts forming an invincible shield
for protection of the fatherland.
"On the threshold of the new year
1916 I send to you my greetings, my
brave warriors. In heart and thought
I am with you while you battle in the
trenches, imploring the aid of the
Most High on your work, your valor
and your courage. Remember this:
Our beloved Russia cannot be assured
I of her independence and her rights,
cannot enjoy the fruits of her labors
or develop her resources unless a de
cisive victory is gained over the en
emy." DEMOCRATIC STATE

DOUBT AUSTR0 RUMOR
Accounts of Quell in Mon
tenegrin and Austrian
Fighting Misleading.
(BULLETIN.)
Vienna, Jan. 14, (via London,
2:50 p. m.) The capture of Cct
tinje, capital of Montenegro, was
announced by the war office today.
The official announcement states:
fcTlie capital of .Montenegro is in
our hands. Our troops, pursuing
the beaten enemy, yesterday after
noon entered Cettinje. The resi
dence of the Montenegrin king and
the town are undamaged. The pop
ulation is calm."
The fall of Cettinje before the invad
ing Austrian forces which greatly out
numbered the comparative small
Montenegrin armies, was regarded as
a question of only a short time after
the capture by the Austrians of Mount
Lovcen. Cettinje is only six miles
from that stronghold.
The present location of the Monte
negrin capital is uncertain, but it is
assumed the seat of government was
removed to some point in the inter
ior when it became apparent that Cet
tinje was in peril. King Nicholas and l
the officials of his government proba-
W. Pave lanen reruge in tne moun

With Cettinje In the hands of the
Austrians the Montenegrins are hem
med in on almost every side and, uu-
of their country. It is doubtful wheth
er they would be able to escape into
northern Albania, and should they do
so they would be opposed by the hos
tile tribes of that region.
Cettinje is a small and unpreten
tious town. It is situated in a narrow
valley at an elevation of 2,000 feet.
London, Jan. 14, (11:50 a. m.) It is
authoritatively announced today that
the reported offensive of the Teutonic
allies against Saloniki did not occur.
Rumors that the attack had been be
gun against the forces of the allies ap
parently originated In the activity of I
the French in blowing up the bridges
connecting Saloniki with the road over
which the attacksrs would normally
travel.
The rumors that Austria and Mont
enegro have suspended hostilities to
discuss terms whereby further warfare
on Montenegrin soil should be stopped,
may be based on the fact that the Aus
trian advance in ITontenegro has be
come so slow that suspicion of a sus
pension of hostilities is naturally
aroused. Many military critics, how
ever, are of the opinion that Monte
negro is now in Buch a position that
some form of arrangement with her
adversary has become imperative.
Italy Ferplexine.
Speculation is rife as to the attitude
which Italy has adopted with regard
to the invasion of Montenegro by the
Austrians which constitutes a grave
menace to Italian interests.
The fact that Italy's superior fleet
did not prevent an Austrian squadron
from assisting in the reduction of
Mount Lovcen, which dominates the
harbor of Cattaro is being commented
upon and experts suggest that Italy's
action in the present juncture should
be awaited, before Judgment is passed.

WholeTrain
of Butter is
Sent Russia
New York, Jan. 14. As showing the
heavy shipments of food supplies now
being made from this port to Russia,
it was stated today that a special
train of 25 cars loaded with butter
j was rushed here from Chicago within
48 hours in order to be shipped on
board the steamer Czaritza and anoth
er vessel leaving port yesterday for
Russia.
The amount of this shipment is un
derstood to have exceeded all records
for a single consignment. This is be
lieved to be the first American-made
butter ever shipped to Russia.

ter to spare and that they are anxious
to extend their exports. The report
of the Associated Warehouses on Jan.

houses 39,338,000 pounds of butter in
storage, an increase of nearly 10,000,
000 pounds over the supply stored one

Flood After
Dikes Break
Amsterdam, Jan. 14, (via London,
3:32 p. m.) The Telegraaf reports
that the Zuider Zee dike at Katwoude
has burst and that Zuidpolder has been
flooded. The inhabitants of that place
have fled to Edam, which is partly
flooded, the newspaper adds.
A later message from Edam says
that the dike protecting Polderezee
vang is in danger and that if it breaks
the result will be the flooding of the
greater part of north Holland.
The province of north Holland forms
a peninsula bounded on the east by the
Zuider Zee and on the west by the
North Sea. It has an area of 1,069
square miles, much of which is be
low the level of the sea and pro

BONUS TO PANAMA
CANAL WORKERS
Washington, Jan. 14. A bonus of at
least six months' pay is proposed for
civilian employes of the government
working on Panama canal construc
tion for three years prior to March 31,
1914, in bills now pending before con
gress. More than five thousand men,
it is estimated, would be benefited. The
bills calls for an appropriation not to
exceed $9,000,000.
In urging adoption of the proposal,
the Panama Canal Employe's associa
tion ca'ls attention to the substantial
rewards already voted by congress to
army, navy and marine hospital offi-
i cers who seived three years or more
in the canal zone and claim that fail
; ure to include civilian employes was
j unintentional and should be corrected.
The basis of reward contained in
the bills is two months' pay for every
j year of servi-e to all civilians who re-
mained at work for three consecutive
years or longer. This would make the
j mamum bonus six months' salary.
Only one man out of every seven civil
ians, it is estimated, remained at his
post for three years.
