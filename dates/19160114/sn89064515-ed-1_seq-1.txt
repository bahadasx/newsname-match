ADOPT SLOGAN FOR CITY
WATER POWER CO. SELECTS
"LITTLE FALLS WHERE POW
ER CREATES OPPORTUNITY''
A slogan has finally been adopted
for Little Falls by the Water Power
company of this city, Messrs. J. L. Mc
Cague of Omaha, Neb., and Frank H.
Parsons of New York City, president
and vice president, respectively, of the
company, having put their seal of ap
proval to it. The slogan is "Little
Falls, Where Power Creates .Oppor
tunity." This slogan was submitted
by T. C. Gordon, secretary-treasurer
and general manager of the company.
Many other slogans were submitted by
local people. The slogan selected was
especially appropriate, the officials of
the company thought, as each word in
it represented the first letter of each'
word of the name of the company, "L.
F. W. P. C-O."
An electric sign with this slogan on
it will be put up on the Water Power
company's four-story building near
the Northwestern flour mill, next
spring. The letters of the sign will
be about 6 feet high, the initial letters
to be in red and the others in white.
The sign will be equipped with a flash
ing device so that the red letters, the
initials of the company, will come on
first and the slogan will follow.

Agreement Not Probable
It is possible that, since the insur

the Lynch crowd may accept the chal

the conference. "However, this is not
probable, for Mr. Lynch has declared
he will not seek a place on the dele
gation, because he expects to be re

The organization men may argue
that since Lynch is an avowed candi

SAYS CONGRESSMAN LINDBERGH
—WRITES AN OPEN
Minneapolis Tribune (13): Congress

that the "big interests" are talking
of "party harmony" and Governor
Burnquist being the logical nominee
of the republican party because the in

Fails to Follow Peterson's Example.
The Sixth district Minnesota con
gressman does anything but follow the
example set by James A. Peterson of
Minneapolis who withdrew from the
gubernatorial contest in favor of Mr.
Burnquist. Mr. Lindbergh says once
more that he has a plan for industrial
uplift and betterment. He is a candi
date for governor, he intimates, only
as a representative of that plan. His
letter, in part, follows:
Offices on Bargain Counter
"From press reports it would appear
that the bosses, who pretend to acit for
the party, are placing the offices which
the people have the constitutional duty
to select, on the bargain counter for
trading purposes. The death of our
late esteemed governor was a sad oc
currence, but the inauguration of a
new governor was an official act even
though it came in the form of an in
heritance. The new governor may be
ever so good a man—I do not question
his purposes nor his ability. Neither
am I rendered dumb by the sudden
turn of things, nor dazed by the slogan
of 'parity harmony.'
"The sudden and unprecedented
stampede of the bosses, followed by the
stand pat portion of the press, all to
bargain the offices that the voters
have a right to select, does not betok
en the people's good. The special in
terests are determined to get rid of me
if they can. The opposition to me is
because I treat the parties as instru
ments to serve the people."
