find any dogs suitable fori his

tained a bill of expense amount
ing to $163. Mr. Hudspeth sent
a draft to cover the amount, but
besp riot heard, Jrora his- English

for bis money' Is the honorary
title of '"lord." Mr.' Hudspeth

A Better Apple Crop,
Ths apple crop Is making more
money than other farm orop in
iMJeeourl If properly grown and
marketed, according? to. J, C
Whittebi of the' Missouri Collece
oil Agriculture, ; Many men 'are
making Utile or nothing put of jt
loause of their failure to prune,
spray,' aud oare for their trees
iob men. hsve been complain-
irg that they could not sell their
apples," and enormous quantities
c?cumiy were wasted in Missouri
orchards last fall. ; At the same
lime, the growers who had pro
perly managed their oroharJs,
graded their fruit, and put it Into
cold storage for higher prloes
later la the winter are making
money but of their crops. If the
orchards are not well managed,
erjtbby, wormy1, or other wise so
udSt for storage (hat a eatisfao
ti jy prloa cannot be secured ; for
It ; jo it la dumped' on ths market
m poor shape for immediate use,
and in worse shape for storage,
Such fruit spoils the market tem
porarily, but Is quickly consum
ed or lost, and even this soon
niter Christmas we are paying
lifgh prioea again for good apples,
v The value of okreful spraying
is well shown by a test in which
tho College coopers ted with twen
tyflvs orohardists and sprayed
Saah orohard four times a year
at a oost of $22.20 an aors. The
ffuit on the uneprayed trees sold
folS13.05 an aore, while that on
fflepraed treVs sold for $181.19
an aore, or more than ten times
as muob, making tho average
net profit from sprayings 1136.78
an aore, or about 600 per cent on
the investment. ., ,
Pruning msy be made to show
equally good results, but both
pruning and spraying is neoes
ssry,J F. Vf, Faurot, of the Ag
ricultural Extension 8 e r v I o e,
say, pruning may bs done any
iime ' during the winter when the
weather is warm enough to make
the"Work comfortable. He pro
oeede to give some brief simple
directions for getting good results
by what he calls renovation prun
Ingjaf apple trees. '; Mos of the
MiseourJL.oronarda are oertalnly
in need of a thoro renovation; ';
Avoid the oommon practice of
cutting of all the branches easily
reached from the ground, and
leaving ma tree looking like a
large feather duster.. Begin at
the. top and thin out branches
which shade the center of the
tree too much. If the tops are
too high, lower them moderately
and gradually so as net to dis
turb ths balanoa between top and
roots, v. If f the root system has
been developed to take care of a
large top and much of this is sud
denly removed, the roots will send
up so much' more material than
the remaining lop can use. that
there will b a-big growth of
water sprouts Most people re
move too little ' instead of ' too
much of the top, but it is' often
neesssary to distribute the work
over two yeavs and sometimes
over three yar.,'-?v'j.
Trees planted too thickly may
need twinning, but if the branches
of neighboring trees overlap, the
level ones may be out back to
some upright branch. . Al way i
prune close to the trunk or main
branch, and never-leave . a stub
to carry deoay into the tree.
Paint all cut surfaces with white
lead and raw of. Cut out blister
canker completely, and disinfect
the pruning tools in a mixture of
corrosive sublimate in a thousand
part ff water, or diseasi may be
carrle 1 from tree to tree thruout
the orchard.. j
Cure Beef At Home..
One of the Important means of
solving ths high cost of living on
ths farm, aooordihg to P. F.
Trowbridge of the University of
Missouri College of Agrioulture,
is being neglected If each farmer
does not produce and cure most
of the meat for his own house
hold.- a
' '; ' '' Jfl'";'' r v v.
Any of the brine or dry mix
tures whioh give good results in
curing pork can be used satisfac
torily for beef,, but as beef Is
leaner than pork, it Bhould not be
allowed to remain in the brine or
mixture quite as long, or it will
beoome hard and sully, t;
Dried beef " should have the
same cure as corned beef, care
being taken not to let It get too
salty. ' It should then be washed
to remove the excess of the oure,
and smoked if you like the smoke
flavor; A very jood country
practice is to dry cure the beef
with salt and brown sugar, using
about a fifthTaa much sugar as
salt, rubbing the meat very thor
oly with the cure every two or
three dnys tor about two weeks.
t should then be washed, wiped,
and hung up to dry in a warm
plaoe if you do not wish to smoke
it, or transferred to the smoke
house and given a light smoke.
Corned beef .'Is at its Very ; beBt
when it has been in the cure
about ten days. ; If kept in the
oure more than a month, It needs
considerable freahr-nirg efore
eooking. 1 It you wish to preserve
the red oolor of the beef,: you
should use a small' amount of
saltpeter, "'. not more ' than two
ounoes to saoh hundred pounds
of the meat. This Improve the
color of the meat but i9detrimen
tal In that it tends to harden the
lean fibers. " -
This is one of ths numerous
practical bits of information be
ing picked up by those attending
Farmers' Week this year. More
extended oourses In killing, cut
ting, and curing of meat will be
given during the seyjen weeks'
course which will open for new
students January 10. ; " ; j
.The facilities of ths College of
Atrlouliure'for1 studying and
w a
teaching this' Bubjeot have re
eently been greatly im preyed by
the installation of a refrigerating
plant. At the close of Farmers'
Week eaoh year, the vlu of the
Instruction Is tested at a big ban
quet, where the meat, prepared
by Professor Trowbridge and the
students, is served. The animals
themselves are raised by the an
imal husbandry department of
the college. The steer slaugh
tered ' this year was a state fair
champion Shorthorn with which
ths College Wished to compete for
honors at the International Live
Stock Show, if the foot ' and
mouth disease had not made it
impossible to hold that show.
; Following a deoision In a dt
vorca suit at Benton laef week,
the sheriff-was required to take a
little three-year-old girl from her
mother's lap and deliver her to
her father. . . . .
It was just like- a novis in
Oedar county trte other day- when
Ernest MoWilliams bought a new
Ford and sorted home in it. .. He
met a buggy with a man, woman
and girl in it, and the team ran
away; The boy who wee driving
the car looked baok to sea wi:at
the team was doing and fell off
the end of the bridge, breaking a
rod and a lamp. " Then William
Heed, tbe blacksmith, who tried
to take the car to his shop ran
into a ditch ' throwing every
body out.

In establishing a muntofpal re
ference bureau, the University
of Missouri will fill a long-felt
want. ' The bureau' plans to fur
nish non-partisan information on
all questions affecting the munic
ipality. If th public wants to
know about the experience of
other , cities wtlh their, sswsg
systems, water supply, paving,
city parks pity goverment, po
Ilea and firs protaoUon, or any of
the 'other problems with whioh
oities struggle, they can get it
free of all oost by application to
the municipal bureau. The
method of procedure will be to
keep on file at the University
newspaper.., clippings,:! reports,
speeches and specially prepared
artioles relating to all matters
nertaininir to the": munieiDalitv.
Thus, in the midst of political
campaigns, when the air is filled
with all sorts of elaims of politi
cians and charges of the failure
of certain measures in other cities,
authoritative- Uitoriution can be
had on short notice by appliaa
tioit to the municipal bureau.
