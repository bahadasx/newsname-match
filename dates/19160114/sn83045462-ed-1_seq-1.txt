White House Decision Announced
After Meeting
of the Cabinet.
ADMINISTRATION TO GIVE
CARRANZA TIME TO ACT
j
Senator Works Introduces Resolu-'
tion Calling for Immediate Use
of U. S. Armed Forces.
1
~ ! ' . . 1
At today's cabinet meeting itii
was decided that the present j1
policy as to Mexico would be!.
maintained and Gen. Carranza;'
would be depended on to punish],
the Villa bandits who killed <
American citizens. 1
This "'followed the receipt of aj
telegram this morning from.Gen. 1
Carranza to his ambassador here!
saying that he will complv with J
the urgent representations of the
I'nited States government that
the guilty persons be hunted
down and punished.
Upon the success of the steps
he takes '.he next move in the
Mexican situation seems to depend.
Senator Stone of Missouri,
chairman of the Senate foreign
relations committee, discussed the
situation in the Senate after a
conference with President Wilson.
He expressed the view that
the United States should eiot
move toward intervention until
the Carranza government had
had a chance to show whether or
not it was capable of controlling
the situation.
Senator Works of California J
introduced a resolution proposing
armed intervention, and declared t
that Congress should share with 4
the President the responsibility J
for whatever is done.
Dispatches to the State De
partment added practically noth- e
ing new to the situation.
Change of Feeling in Senate.
A decided change in the feeling 3
of the Senate toward the Mexican j [
situation is making itself manifest! \
today on both the democratic and j1
republican sides. Senators who 1
have hitherto been in favor of j1
keeping out of Mexico have '
reached the conclusion that some- ,*
thing must be done by this coun-r
try. not only to protect American' *
lives and property in that coun-s
try. but also to bring about order j ?
for the Mexican people them-'"
selves for humanitarian reasons. | a
The policy of watchful waiting j
adopted b- the administration hasj,
ceased to appeal to many ot the' e
senators who hitherto have ac- "
quiesccd in it.
Would Use Armed Forces. I t
A joint resolution directing: the j a
President of the United States to use
the armed forces of th:s country for f
the purpose of intervention in Mexico ! e
to brine about a stable government j i
there was introduced in the Senate today
by Senator Works of California. | i
"I believe the time has come," said fc
Senator Works, "for Congress to lift 3
the burden of this Mexican trouble from
the shoulders of the President; for the i
members of Congress who have been c
criticising the policy of the admin.stration
to take some affirmative action. a
Jn my opinion there is only one thing s
ihat we can do, and that is to Intervene c
in Mexico, aid the Mexicans in estab- g
lishing a stable government, and after
it has been established and proper assurances
have been given the United 0
States that all Americans and other a
foreigners in Mexico will be given am- u
pie protection the United States should ?
leave Mexico to the Mexicans again." t
House Committee Holding Back. 1
House resolutions looking to intervention
in Mexico will not be considered
by the foreign affairs committee for h
the present. Chairman Flood j^aid to- P
day Announcement of this decision ^
followed the first meeting of the com- 11
inittee since Representatives Dyer of v
MicaAiiri arut t\f U'??? Vt.?ir.in ?? h
I rod u red their intervention proposal*. J
We certainly shall do nothing wlthj.
these resolutions until we have the full-| J
est information on the Mexican situ- s
anon," Mr. Flood declared. :s
The senators may be divided into|s
groups today as follows: Those who j j
believe that the United States should !
take- immediate steps to protect Ameri- i
cans and their property in Mexico by c
means of the armed forces of this | i
country, which means intervention; f
sc.-ond. those who believe that Car- J ^
. ansa should be given a chance to run 1
down the bandits who have been kill- J r
ing Americans, and that if he fails to J c
make good, then the United States f
should take a hand in the work of j
driving tlvse bandits out. r
ThirJ. those who believe that an offer
should be made to Carranza by the t
1 mted States government to send ,
Nmerican forces 1.0 Mexico to act in ?
4 onaert with the Uarranza forces to
pe out the bandits. Fourth, a coin- <
p.dratively small number who believe \
t ; t the United Slates should sit tight
a-id pursue the policy which it has followed
for the last two years.
In Favor of Prompt Action.
Senator Works of California. Senator ^
Cummins of Iowa and Senator Borah I c
o" Idaho believe that immediate action j(
should be taken. 11

ARREST IS ORDERED
TO MM TEST CASE
The Department of Ubor issued a
warrant today for the arrest at Detroit
of Frank Caswell, an American, discharged
recently from the Canadian
forces, to make a test case to have the
United States courts determine if an
American citizen expatriates himself
by enlisting in a foreign army.
The technical charge against Caswell
is violation of the contract labor law
in entering the I nited States to take
employment at Detroit. The decision
is expected to fix definitely the status
of hundreds of Americans returning
from army service abroad.
Caswell, a native of Harrison. Me.,
enlisted with the Canadian expeditionery
forces last April, but was discharged
in England for physical disability
arid returned to Canada. On an
offer of employment at Detroit*he tried
to re-enter the United States at Port
Huron, Mich., but was excluded by immigration
officers.

KINDLIER FEELING
FOR COL ROOSEVELT:
| New York Republicans, How- |
j/ ever, Not Stampeded by
Progressive Overture.
i ia! t'orre*ponden?-e of The .
| NEW YORK. January 13.?New York j I
is bubbling* with presidential politics.
The seething- stage. however, will 7tot j
. ; be reached for a few weeks yet.
The sensation of the week, of course. '
1 has been the bull moose meeting at
i Chicago. Mingling for a couple of days
J with business men as well as politi
cians has enabled me to take some oh- '
j serrations of the situation it has de- 'j
velnripfl
1 ' ' s
I I? is clear that the Chicago demon- ^
j.mat ion lias not stampeded the New ^
j York republican* who*. stood by the :
j party three year* ago. They have re- i ,
j ceived the shock, absorbed it like a j ^
cushion and continue calmly determiu- !,
ed that the colonel shall not be the j
republican candidate. Yet there is a j n
much kindlier* feeling toward him than )c
formerly. j tl
This may be due to the universal de- ^
sire for harmony and the belief that!,..
Col. Roosevelt is sincere in his deter- . ^
! miration to oust the democratic naitional
administration by sacrificing his r ^
! private grudges, or it may be one of J u
J those psychological episodes in politics j jt
; which no one can explain. Rut a fair- I
! blinded observer is bound to take note J
! |hat Col Roosevelt as an influence is j
! much stronger with the republicans T.
than he was last fall. Y
This being so, it would seem that he tj
! might get their support, if not for the ^
nomination, at least for the election. g4
The test of individual opinions, which
is always safer than generalizing, gives
little encouragement to this notion I
tried it out during chance talks with M
several persons who vote.
Views of Business Men. !
A republican business man who voted J*
for Wilson in 1912 out of resentment tc
toward Roosevelt told me there had j tl
been a great change of sentiment, and ai
frankly declared the change in his: ir
own feelings He liked Roosevelt's
Americanism, and while not commit- aj
ting himself, was open-minded. This tl'
receptive state of mind would be recognized
by politicians as the forerun- J*
ner of a vote for Roosevelt. ?
Another republican business man said
some kind things and casually remarked
that it would pain him to vote
against C?v.. lioosevelt and he hoped
the republican national convention
would spare him that pain.
A banker who was close to Taft com
mented on the conciliatory attitude of
Roosevelt as a powerful Influence in reuniting
the factions of the party and
deprecated harsh criticism of the
colonel. He said he would cast an antiRoosevelt
vote with great regret, if
such a. necessity arose, but he did not
think it would arise.
The republican editor of an independent
newspaper said that Roosevelt, if
nominated, would lose his vote.
A national politician who knows what
it is to take a politician's medicine said
Roosevelt's nomination would mean the
i loss of his vote.
A second series of interviews developed
about the same unamhtity.
They showed why the republican leaders
and ex-bosses have not lost their
equanimity over the Roosevelt demonstration
at Chicago. These republican '
politicians do not fear a stampede or j
that the convention will be bludgeoned
into nominating the colonel. In his
quest for a candidate with w.hom to
beat Wilson Col. Roosevelt, by a
process of elimination, may reach the
hasty conclusion that he himself is the
only man. but the knowledge, easily to
be had, that t)e cannot .get republican
votes at the polls may cause him to
begin another search or to acquiesce

Of F AMERICAN SHIP
i
'rivate Clark Removed at Jamaica
and Closely Ques
tioned by British.
N'KVV YORK, .January 11.?Albert;
'lark, private In the 5th United States j
nfantry. was removed from the steam- ,
hip Santa Marta at Jamaica by a j
tritish neutrality officer, according- to j
assengers who arrived here on the j
anta Marta today. After being de- j
aineU ashore several hours Clark was j
llowed to return to the ship and pro- i
eerl here. j
Clark, who had served nineteen |
months in the CanaI Zone, was proeeding
to Washington under orders
o report to the adjutant general and
'as in full uniform when he was fempoarily
removed from the Santa Marta,
rhich flies the American flag.
This is said to be the first time a
Tnited Statgg soldier has been removed
nder similar conditions from an Amcr;an
vessel since the war of 1812. j
Passengers Closely Questioned.
When the Santa Marta stopped at
amaica, en route from Colon to New
ork, a British neutrality officer boarded
te vessel and closely questioned all pasMigers
as to their nationality. Clark
tid he was born near Vienna, but had
iken out his first American citizenship
apers some time ago.
The neutrality officer left the ship
ithout comment on Clark's case, but
lortly afterward, passengers said, three
egro soldiers in uniform boarded the
anta Marta and told Clark to accomany
them ashore.
Subsequently, Clark said, he was taken
? what is known as the lower concentra
jii cainp, ?>rr the outskirts of Jamaica,
ad. there closely questioned by the comlandlng
officer.
While he was absent American pas:ngers
on the Santa Marta decided to
ppeal to the American consul, but before
lis could be done Clark returned.
Clark said today that he would make a
ill report of the incident to the War
'epartment.

KAISER FAILS 10 READ
| SPEECH FROM THRONE
Diet Ceremony Inside Palace^ According
to Amsterdam
Advices.
| LONDON. January 14.?An Amsterdam
dispatch to the Daily Express
says:
"Anxiety in Berlin for the emperors
health reached a climax when it was
1 announced at the eleventh hour thai.
:contrary to his intentions, the emperor
had not read the speech from the
i throne at the opening of the diet.
"The ceremony of the opening of the
diet took place inside the palace, so
that the emperor need not leave the
building. Therefore it cannot be said
that he was merely remaining: indoors
as a precaution. This confirms the
I rumors that the emperor's illness is
serious, but it is impossible to obtain
further information."
I" LONDON, January 14.?The Berliner
Tageblatt, according to a wireless dispatch
from Berlin, states that the emperor
is suffering from a boil, that does
not prevent him from walking out.
"The return to Berlin of Prince von
Buelow,*.the former German chancellor,
from his sojourn in Switzerland, was
due to a summons to attend a council,
over which the crown prince will pre-,
side, to deal with measures to be adopted
If the emperor's illness is prolonged
or ail operation unsuccessful," says a
dispatch to the Star from Rome.
"Meanwhile it is absolutely impossible
to obtain any information even through
neutral diplomatic sources regarding
the emperor's condition," adds the dispatch.
"Even the usual optimistic reports
about his health are now being
withheld."
BERLIN, January 13, via London,
January 14, 4:20 a.m.?Emperor William
again is in good health. He no
longer reipains in his apartment, but
takes his usual walks in Potsdam in
pleasant weather.
The boil on the emperor's neck has
so far healed that he is again wearing
his uniform, but he leaves the high
collar open to prevent pressure on the
tender spot.
An official who conversed with the
emperor Wednesday and Thursday
said he was in exceptionally good spirits,
and that there was absolutely nothing
to justify the pessimistic reports about
him printed abroad.

Heretofore subordinate officials under

HEARINGS ENDED '
ON THE D. C. BILL
Little Hope Is Held Out for
Report Early in
Session.
i
COMMITTEE IS EXPECTED
TO CUT OUT MANY ITEMS
} May Include Only Such Provisions
as Will Not Meet With Points
of Order.
I
1
Hearings 011 tlie District approj
priation bill have been ended, and
I tlie work of can ing a measure
I out of the estimates is now before
! the subcommittee of the approj
priations committee, of which
I Representative I'age of North
C.arolina is chairman.
The bill will not be reported
early, a* has been the custom for
I the past two Congresses. It is
j also practically certain that only
ja small portion of the many legislative
proposals contained in the
; Commissioners' estimates will find
j their way into the bill when reported
to the House.
Many Items Will Be Cut.
At present the subcommittee shows a
j disposition to include only such legislative
provisions as will not meet with
points of order. It is also improbable
that the Commissioners' recommendation
to transfer the control of the
Washington aqueduct from the War
Department to the District authorities
will be a part of the bill.
Not even the members of the subcommittee
have a clear idea of what the
amount of the bill will be; and their
determination on this point will not
come until they have all carefully digested
the testimony of the city officials
who have appeared in the executive
hearings. Chairman Page has told
members of the House that as far as
he is concerned he is more than ever
disposed to view the estimates on their
merits, regardless of the amount the
United States will pay. It is reported
that those members with whom he has
conversed on this subject have agreed
with him in that view.
Some of those members have said to
him that the report of the joint select
committee would make for a liberality in
the House that has been missing heretofore
when the long and arduous fights
over the half and half appropriations
were in progress.
"Now that the mind of Congress seems
i to be made up that Congress should de|
lermine just how much it should pay for
! - ?1 " ooiH o nrnminunt momhor r.f
! the appropriations committee today, "I
should judge that it would be liberal.
1 That is my own choice, at least."
j The bill will await legislative develop
ments on the new financial role which the
! United States is vo play. The bill containing
the recommendations of the joint
select committee "must l?e reported to the
House. It is claimed1 in the appropriations
] committee, before the District bill should
| be taken upon the. floor. Also the imjponant
recommendations concerning, the
[board of education should be thrashed
j out before it is aitenipied to weld them
| to an appropriation bill. It is possible
that tl ey wili go to the House in a
: separate measure, and will be acted upon
! regardless of the appropriations measure.

PROPOSE HIGHER RATES
FOR TRANSPORTING PAPER
Demand of Railways Combated by
Owners of Mills at HearingGiven
by I. C. C.
Arguments were made today before
the interstate commerce commission on
proposed increased freight rates on
newsprint, wrapping and other kinds
of paper, from eastern mills and in
Michigan to points between the 'Mississippi
ri< er and tlvs seaboard, the great
lakes and the Ohio and Potomac rivers.
The increases would run as high as 10
cents per hundred pounds.
Representatives of niills told the commission
the railroads had not shown
justification for the increase, and submitted
no evidence to support the ad
varices except their need or revenue.
Representatives of the roads declared
the tariffs on paper throughout the territory
need readjustment, and the schedules
proposing the increases were filed
more for that reason than to get
higher rates.

1 <>ttinje is a small and uiiprelentioiiR
town. Its population twenty years ago
was less than 3.000. The fall of Cettinje
before the invading: Austrian
forces was regarded as a matter of
only a short time after the capture by
the Austrians of Mount Lovcen. Cettinj?
is only six miles from that stronghold..
The present location of the Montenegrin
government is uncertain, but it is
j assumed the seat of government was
i removed to some point in the interior
j when it became apparent that Cetthije
i was in peril. There have been conflicting
reports as to the whereabouts
of King Nicholas, but he and the oiflcials
of his government probably have
taken refuge in the mountains.
Speculation as to Italy.
i Speculation is rife as to the attitude
which Italy had adopted with refraru
to the invasion of Montenegro by the
Austrians. which constitutes a grave
I menace to Italian interests.
The fact that Italy's superior fleet
! did not prevent an Austrian squadron
\ from assisting in the reduction of
i Mount I^ovcen, which" dominates the
j harbor of Cattaro, is being commented
j upon, though experts admit that therj
j is not a sufficient basis of information
I from which .to draw deductions in the
j matter, and they suggest that Italy's
action in the present juncture should
be awaited before judgment is passed,
and that action, they point out, wouid
naturally be kept secret as long a*
possible.
Italy Balked. Is Belief.
BERLIN. January 14.?The Overseas
News Agency says:
"Berlin newspapers commenting upon
the capture of Mount Lovcen point out
the political importance of the event,
the conquest of the height having rendered
impossible of realization Italian
domination of the Adriatic, which the
Italians considered the principal object
of the war.
"The papers note the fact that before
Italy entered the war she bad made it
the principal condition for maintaining
neutrality that Mount Lovcen
should not be attacked by AustriaHungary.
They also institute comparisons
between the fruitless efforts of
the entire Italian army against thft
Austro-Ilungarians with the brilliant.
Austro-Hungarian achievements performed
simultaneously with bitter
fighting that was in progress op otiicr
fronts."
View in Vienna.
Immense importance is attached to
the taking of Lovcen. as reflected by the
Austrian press, in which it is hailed a?
the most brilliant feat of the war.
The Vienna Neue Freie I'rcsse says

land strongest harbors, and that in It
will begin a new chapter in the his|
tory of the Austrian fleet.

of Lovcen. which ihev declare
