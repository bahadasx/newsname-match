began today.
The Page subcommittee, in pre

not the intention of the committee
to proceed hastily to pass the Dis

As actual work on the framing
af-tfioJbiUobcgms. it is learned that
the various legislative, recom

consideration of such -recommendations

BRITISH EMBASSY
Carranza Vows To Punish Slayers
General Carranza in a message to Eliseo Arredondo, ambas
sador here, today declared the bandits who killed Americans in
Chihuahua arc being pursued and will meet "condign punishment."
He said:
"The murderous attack on the passenger train near Chi
huahua was made by the only remaining band of outlaws in
that region. This band is being actively pursued in order to
ensure its capture. Whereupon condign punishment which
their crime deserves will be meted to every guilty participant.
"The constitutionalist government troops have been or
dered to establish strong patrols from end to end of the railway
line in order to forfend against similar outrages.
"You will make this declaration to the press of the
United States. VENUSTIANO CARRANZA."
Official announcement was made this';'pfeKhat
the American Government will take no aggressive 'action
in Mexico. S
The statement was made following the. Cabinet meet
ing at which the whole Mexican situation was discussed at
length. f & r.
While the storm of indignation over thrfiSssjgre of
Americans in Mexico continued today toSfwppRlirough
Congress, and while the British embassy was preparing to
requestor- the State Department what course this Govern
ment intends to pursue to get protection for foreigners, the
Administration stands unmoved.
SENATORS URGE INTERVENTION.
Stirring arguments favoring the sending of the armed
forces into Mexico resounded in the Senate chamber. Agi
tation over the possible fate of British subjects across the
Rio Grande was responsible for frank expressions from the
British embassy concerning the lack of any responsible
authority in M'exico City ,to which Great Britain could
appeal.
At the White House the President conferred vith
Senator Stone, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and with his Cabinet, his aim being to buttress
the Administration jn its determination to do nothing
aggressive and rely on Carranza.
Carranza himself sent a personal- telegram to Secre
tary of State Lansing in response to the American note de
manding the capture and punishment of those who mur
dered the seventeen Americans at Santa Ysabel. He will,
he said, mete out "condign punishment."
SOLDIERS RULE EL PASO.
From the border today there came report after report
telling of the excitement stirred Jip in the American border
towns over the refusal of the Administration to act. Re
sentment over the attitude of the President and the Secre
tary of State in laying the blame for the massacre on th
American victims has so inflamed the people of El Paso,
Tex., that practical martial law is being enforced by the
regular army troops stationed there under Brigadier Gen
eral Pershing.
The War Department denies that Pershing has been
given instructions to take such vigorous measures, but
press dispatches indicated that the officer may have acted
on his own responsibility.
No further orders of any kind have gone either to the
ai my or naval forces of the United Stales.
"Everything's happy in the navy," said Jbcrcfary
Daniels at the close of the Cabinet meeting.
