MAJORITY OF CITIZENS
IAV?II BOND ISSUE PUN
Mass - Meeting Overwhelmingly
Votes to Complete Roads by
Old Method Rather Than
Pay-As-You-Go Plan.
An enthusiastic road mass-meeting
was held in the Court House last
Monday for the purpose of devising
ways and means for completing the
roads already commenced?close up
gaps?building other new roads need?
ed, and maintaining the roads here?
after built.
How to raise the necessary money
?by increasing tho road levy or by
bond issues in the different districts,
was the main question before the
meeting. The sentiment, of the meet?
ing seemed to be decidedly in favor of
bond issues.
In a separate meeting of represen?
tatives of Jeffersonville district, a vole
taken showed that 35 were in favor.of
a bond issue and only 4 votes for
increasing the road levy.
Clear Fork resolved upon a bond
issue sufficient to complete the roads
laid out or called for in the original
bond issue, and a maximum levy of
30 cents for maintenance.
The Maiden Spring representatives
wanted nothing more. The remain?
der of their bond issue money and
the regular levy, they say, will ena?
ble them to complete their roads with
the convict labor, and maintain them.
They failed to point out how the four
or five miles of mud roads beyond
Copenhavei's to the Russell county
line will be completed. It is said that
a reconsideration of the action of the
representatives of the Cove people
in the meeting hero, will likely be
had and a vote taken on the issuing
of bonds for completing this stretch
of much needed road, which is the
only mud hole not provided for in the
Bluefield-Britsol highway.
The amount of the proposed bond
issue for Jeffersonville district will
be considerably over $100,000, r.nd
a like amount will be proposed for the
Clear Fork district.
It is proposed to have the present
Tnzewcll county road law amended
which will enable the people of the
county to spend the money for roads
regardless of the highway commis?
sion.

Resolutions by W. C. T. U.
On January 3rd, 1916, it pleased
our Heavely Father to remove from
earthly suffering to Heaven our be?
loved friend and member, Mrs. George
Buston.
A noble character laid down the ac?
tivities of this life for rest and joys
of the better life beyond. It is be?
cause of our appreciation of her past
usefulness among us that we, the
members of the Womans Christian
Temperance Union, wish to express
our sympathy and love.
1. That we bow in humble submis?
sion to His will, who doeth all things
well.
2. That we thank God for her beau?
tiful Christian character, which has
been an example and inspiration to us
all.
3. That we feel that we have been
called to give up one of our most
earnest members; we miss her works
and kindly fellowship, but most of all
we miss her prayers, even when sick?
ness prevented her attending the Un?
ion, we knew that she was praying for
the temperance work and was with us
in spirit.
?i. That a copv of these resolutions
be sent to the family and placed on
the minutes of our Union.

GENUINE ECONOMY.
You Can Practice This Noble Art by
Going to M. J. Hankies' Sale.
Inferior goods are never cheap.
No matter what they cost they are
expensive, because they are bound
to be unserviceable. This applies to '
merchandise of every sort.
On the other hand, good merchan- j
[Use is never expensive if sold at a
reasonable price. It is bound to
qrivo full satisfaction and value for
iwery penny of costs.
We never sell any merchandise that
is not up to the highest standard in
quality. For ten days our prices aro
considerably reduced, and mean gen?
uine economy to every purchaser.
See our big ad. elsewhere in this
paper.

2. That , to her beloved church she

Christian women, we commend her
labit of so ordering the ways of her
louschold that there was time to give

4. That to this community her
character was a "city set upon a hill,"
.vhose perefctions now shine with an
idded beauty in the light of heav

TAZEWELL, VI
BABY BEEF CLUS URGED
FOR TAZEWELL C01TI
State Live Stock Specialist Rec?
ommends Organization of So?
ciety Here?Rules and Rog?
ations and Premiums.
Prof. J. R. Hutchinson, state live?
stock specialist, has asked the farm
demonstration agents of each of the
Southwest Virginia counties to or?

ber of the club is to show his calf at
the County Fair. The best calves

test.
The following rules will govern the
Baby Beef Club:
1. All boys or girls between the ag?
es of 8 and 21 years may be mem?
bers
2. Spring calves, either heifers or
steers, born in March, April or May,
1915, will be used in the contest.
3. The calf must be weighed at the
beginning and ending of the contest
by the county demonstration agent.
4. A daily record must be kept of
the kind and nmount of feed used.
Where members hnve no scnlcs to
weigh feed, they will use some meas?
ure agreed upon by the county agent.
5. The contest will begin officially
on February 1st, 1916, and will end
at a time next fall agreed upon by
the State Live Stock Specialist.
fi. Prizes will be awarded for:

ten account of raising the cnlf.
Here is a chance for the boys and
girls of Tazewell county to show the
other counties what good blucgraos
will do.

County Agricultural Agent.
Pruning Fruit-Thecs.
The time for nruning fruit trees is
nlmost here. February and March are
the months in which this work is us?
ually done. Pruning is nn art, and
rr>n only be accomnlishcd by practice.
However, a few simple rules should
bo followed:
Remove all dead limbs, and cross
branches. Remove water sprouts, ex
cent where it is necessary to replace
old growth with 7iew. Top back high
trees; the day of mule tnil pruning is
past. Never leave a stub of a limb,
as this will not heal over, and rotten
stubs cause decayed trees. The prop?
er time to begin training a tree, is
when it is young. Three to five branch?
es are sufficient to form a head on a
young tree. If posible, one should
visit nn orchard that is properly prun?
ed before attempting this kind of
work, An orchard specialist will
(rive a pruning demonstration in
Tazewell some time in Februnry. Ev?
ery one having an orchnrd, should try
to be present. Announcement of the
date will be made later.
JAMES L. MONTAGUE,
County Agricultural Agent.
Raise Standard of Stock Will Help
Tazewell County.
Blacksburg, Vu., Jan. 11.
Editor the News:?I am glad to see
from your paper that our county ag?
ricultural agent has started one of the
best associations that can be had in
any county to raise the standard
of the stock of the county, and espec?
ially tho cattle.
We have good cattle in our county
but they are far below the standard
in general, and it is an outrage for
such a progressive and prosperous
cattle county as Tazewell ot let their
cattle degenerate, instead of trying
to improve them each year.
By the county association you can
secure one breed or breeds of beef
cattle, and by purchasing pure-bred
sires can in the course of a few years
have a uniform typo of beef cattle,
which will demand a much better
price.
If you do not desire to practice in?
breeding, the Association aids in mov?
ing a sire of high breeding qualities
to a new community and there using
him. In this way you are able to keep
in the county the sires which you have
proven to be of high breeding quali?
ties by handing down their good char -
acteristics to their offsprings.
By th use of pure-bred sires on
the grade females you may by careful
selection of the fidrt generation, (only
females), raise the standard or they
will' be one-half pure-bred. Where
you have a sire of very high breed?
ing qualities you may use him to
breed the females of the first genera?
tion, where- you wish to improve his
qualities. This is known as inbreed?
ing and should be handled very care?
fully. In this way, the second gen?
eration will possess three-fourths
pure-bred and in this way you will
soon have a class of animals uniform
in type and qualities.
The three essential points in im?
proving of farm animals are: He?
redity, selection, and environment. He?
redity is the tendency of the offspring
to resemble the parent. By selec?
tion wo are able as far a spor.sible'
to select and breed only_ those vvhich
have desirable characteristics, and at
nil times disregarding those which
do not come up to our standnrd. The
environment consists largely of food,
shelter and care, including training
and developing. To obtain grentest
advancement the animal must be well
fed at all times, but more especially
while young, since the individual re?
tarded at this oge will never reach
that degreo of perfection, which it
otherwise would had it been properly
nourished during the days in which
growth was j possible.
I wish you great success in your as?
sociation.
Yours very truly,
G. S. GILDERSLEEVE, JR.

- Judge Kelly for Supreme Bench.
Bristol, Jan. 8.?Judge Joseph L.
Kelly, of Bristol, now a member of
. the Virginia Supreme Court, was to
f day slroffgly endorsed by the Bristol
bar to succeed the late Justice Lnmnr
as a member of the United States su?
preme court. Judge Kelly, it is undor
. stood, will be made Virginia's candi?
date. He is forty-eight years old,
and his record as a lawyer and jurist
entitles him to tho highest considera?
tion.
It is expected that the lawyers and
jurist of every city and town in
Virginia will join in presenting his
name : to the president. A special
committee of Bristol lawyers was
.lamed today to present Judge Kelly's
1 name,, and this committee will invite
delegations from all counties in the
State to join in urging the uppoint
1 ment of Judge Kelly.
Those who know Judge Kelly, as
he is known here, nre confident that
he would make an enviable record in
the high position for which he has
been suggested.

Favors Strengthening Central
Executive Power of (he Slate
If Will of the People is to
lie Made Effective.
Richmond, Jan. 12.?Rigid enforce?
ment of the prohibition laws, which
are to bo written into Virginia's stat?
ute books at this session, following '
the overwhelming approval of that. 1
policy by the people at tho polls, a j
request that the hands of the govern?
ment be strengthened in order to on- 1
force prohibition, and a discussion of
taxation, featured the message of
Governor Henry C. Stuart to the gen- !
oral assembly, which convened in bien?
nial session at noon today. In point
out the difficulties presented by tho '
enforcement of state-wide prohibition
Govenor Stuart said:
"To assume that, tho local officers
can and will, in all cases, perform
their duties in this respect, is to shut
our eyes to tho experience of all other
States where prohibition laws have
been enacted. General disregard of i
law, lack of respect for public officials ;
is an evil as gront as intemperance I
itself, and if we increase the former <
evil without decreasing tho latter I
prohibition will prove a calamity and i
not a blessing. I, therefore, call your c
attention to the fact that tho strength- I
ening of the central executive power
of the Slate is absolutely essential to
the proposed enforcement of prohibi?
tion."
Discussing the new tax system, the
I Governor said:
"Shall the people of the State be
cheated out of their long delayed nd
i vantage by the hue and cry raised
i by interested parties against the
I methods necessary to rench and main?
tain substantial resources."
It is essential, ho said, that means
of discovering undeclared intangible
property will be maintained and
strengthened.
