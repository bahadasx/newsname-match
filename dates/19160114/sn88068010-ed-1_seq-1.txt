James Wren Charged as Boot
' legger. Comical Criminal
Case. Culprit Gone.
As an opener of the new year,
James Wren, nearly 70 years old
farmer and stockman of 5 miles
northwest of town, applied a
shelaly to the "noggin" of one
Huck West for some alleged mis
treatment on the part of West of
Wren some time ago.
It was rumoted that perhaps
West would prefer a charge
against the veteran of many ' en
counters for felonious assault,
iinH Wrf-n anticiDated such a
move by complaining to the
prosecuting attorney against
West for bootlegging whUkey to
him. The information was
drawn up in legal form and the
clerk issued warrant for the ar-
rpst nf the nartv named in the
warrant The warrant was de
lived to Sheriff Hurt Monday
arid he went after the alleged
criminal promptly, keeping per
fectly still about the matter un
til he had his man. Instead of
Huck West being named in the
information or warrant,' James
Wren's name was there and af
ter James Wren the sheriff put
out and got him at home. When
he informed the old gentleman
that he had a warrant for his
surest for violation of the local
option law. and that he might
consider himself under arrest,
Wren was astonished to the
point of speechlessness, but re
covering sufficient breath, re
marked that there must bf
some mistake, that he, Wren,
hot whiskey4 OTver"Trcfflng ; it-
wouldn't sell a drop if he had a
barrel. The sheriff knew no
more than what his warren t said
and placed the alleged bootlegger
under bond to appear at the next
term of the circuit court and an
swer the charge.
In addition to some other cir
cumstances, the fact that West
disappeared from town as soon
as he learned that Wren had
been arrested, precludes tne
probability of West having made
such a complaint against Wren,
and that there was a mistake in
drawing the information, but if
West will claim that there was
no mistake in drawing the
information, and that he
informed the prosecuting at-
-torney that Wren did, , on the
23rd. day of: Dec., 1915. sell to
" him. West two several half
pints of whiskey for .which; he,
Westr paid Wren -in; ;the;agirre-
v; 'uate 80 cents,; thejt the- sheriff
had the right sow by the ear so
far as the proceedings to date
are concerned. However, Wren
can establish his contention that
he always bought, never sold,
whiskey by such a preponder
ance of testimony that a jury
with Dr. Anna Howard Shaw
foreman woman and the other 1
of her selection would clear the
. defendant without leaving the
jury box. As it is, in any event
. of mistake or no mistake in the
information, Wren will have to
appear before the circuit court
and answer to the charge of dis
. ' posing of a part of his favorite
pastime.

Mrs. Dan Nichols is seriously
ill and doubts are , entertained
concerning her recovery.
Deaths in this county have
been numerous since'' October,

are not an exception,; for grippe

Mrs. Charles Dameron
Carrie Stephenson, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. William Steph
enson who came to this county
from Kentucky in an early day
and settled where Chraneville
now is, was born on the old
homestead February 26, 1858
and ived all her life in the same
neighborhood. In 1881 she was
married to Charles Dameron one
of the most prominent young
men of the county and of the
family always prominent in the
county and state, and to the un
ion came eight children, one
dying at the age of 5 years and
7 months and Mrs. Willie Quick

of a little more than a week of a
complication arising from grippe,
died at her home . near Chrane

by all the immediate members of
her family except Mrs. Quick
who was confined with pneumonia.
At Corinth Sunday Rev. Duvall
pastor of the Cumberland Pres
byterian church of which Mrs.
Dameron had been a member for
years, held most impressive ser
vices, and tho the day was most
disagreeable, one of the largest
crowds ever seen at Corinth on
such an occasion assembled to
pay their respects to the memory
of their relative, neighbor, sister
and friend.
Devoted to -her family, and
training her children in morals
and the love of home and duty:
provided with a luxurious home
and surroundings, the fruit of a
life of labor and frugality: pos
sessing the confidence and es
teem of all who knew her: and
dispensing the hospitality of her
Kentucky and Missouri ancestors
enlarging the family circle of
friends and admirers, it was yet
the will of her Master that she
abandon all these and answer
His call, and with that grace and
resignation which had character
ized her life, she relinquished all
claim on earthly things and look
ed to the realization of her fond
est Christian hopes.

She Didn't Say it
Little Ann s motner was very
particular about the language
her small daughter used, and
had told her expressly
never; v . to - - say the name
"devil' V. One Sunday evening
the mother' inquired what the
day's lesson had been about
"Why, mother V was Ann's
answer, 'it was about when our
Lord was tempted by the by
the the gentleman that keeps
hell!" Everybody's.
. A. F. Arrington returned from
his trip to Humansville Wednes
day and reports conditions at
his mercantile establishment
down there to be in a flourishing
condition.
. f aul uropper is here and is
likely to star for awhile and
there is little excuse for not hav
ing a first class musical organ
ization. The. talent and tooters
are now on hand and there is al

he can be induced to, assemble
the horns and drums and get
busy. '. : '.
The storm which has been on
since the latter part of last week
culminated Tuesday night in a
sleet biizzard and Wednesday
morning the ground and every
thing else outdoors was covered
with about an inch of ice. The
trees, especially the evergreen
variety which took on the ap
pearance of weeping willows
with the tears frozen, were
drooped as tn bodies a3 well as
branches and the crystal-like
heavy decoration on all lent a
beautiful appearance to frowz
led snags with limbs awry
a3 well a9 . the stately mon
archy of the lawn3.
Stock which had no shelter
suffered, standing against the
rising wind with backs covered
with a coat of ice which had
conformed to the humped frames
while congealing and preventing
straightening out as would a
crooked-jacket Wood piles and
coal dumps outdoors were .mina
ture foothills about glaciers.. The
one saving clause in the entire
disagreeable weather condition
was the elasticity of the inch
sleet covering on roads and pave
ments, otherwise pedestrians
would have been skaters, skid-,
ders or flipfloppers. .
Before noon the wind had
shifted to the northwest, the
thermoneter falling to 10 above
and granulated particles of cut
ting snow pebbles and ice flying
promiscuously. The lightning wal
vivid Tuesday morning and' tne
thunder like an echo from,. Europe
and all day rain and snow drizzle
made the day a breeder of grippe,
pneumonia or lumbago with -Rule
of the right kind of medicine' at
hand. Yes, winter has come
but how long it will remain de
pendb on Whether the merchants
advertise liberally their rapidly
going-out-of-style and season
goods.
Thursday morning the ther
mooeter at Dr. J. T.Dewejs
home marked 10 below, and re
ports from various part3 of town
range from 8 to 18 below With
in the week temperature ranged
from balmy spring to Alaskan.'
No prettier winter scenery was
ever pictured in nature or on
canvas than appeared when the
sun rose Thursday morning. Cold
ane glittering crystals outdoors
everywhere. Some curious freaka
of Boreas are noticeable. The
water, 6 feet from the top of the
well at the lumber yard froze
over, solid. A porter takings
bucke-: of water from the Tip
pett blacksmith shop to a store
a block distent found it frozen
when he reached the -store on
the run. Flowers, fruit and
vegetables froze in rooms where
there was afire all night Gaso
line, vinegar and coal oil tanks
froze solid. Marion Veatch put a
bucket of water on a hot stove to
prevent freezing end for use
preparing his bachelor breakfast
He was careless and used' a
wooden bucket When he-arose
the bucket was burned and a
solid chunk of ice sat tn the
8io ve. CoL Cousins let' icicles
get on his beard and breaking
them off snapped the whiskers
and nearly spoilt his appearance.
At this time there is no' way to
estimate the number of bobtail
ed cows, . attempting to switch
them, their tails shattered and
one .case is reported of horns
cracked off by the warm breath
striking them.. -. . .. '
We have heard, of, worse, but
not much.

a little. She baa been seriously
affiicied with grippe. . ,
