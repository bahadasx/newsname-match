As tiie tbiy for the voting ap

the "wets" and the "drys"
waxes warmer. Both fides, of
course, claim victory by a sub
stantial majority, but to tiie
conservative, nun-euthusiasiie:
citizen, it appears to be n race
about evenly matched To say
that both fides are busy, would
be rtating is mildly. Li more
appropriate language, they an
