GENERAL FEDERATION
OF WOMEN'S CLUBS
The work of women's clubs centers
chiefly around the child. Why are
club women interested in establishing
art associations, in raising the popular
taste in music, in securing .better civil
service regulations, cleaner cities and
towns, in conserving natural resourc
es, in improving educational condi
tions, in learning how to be more
efficient homemakers, and in all that
pertains to public health? The an
swer is, because they are concerned
for the child, the citizen of tomoirow,
and are desirous of surrounding him
with better living conditions.
It was largely through the influence
of the General Federation of Women's
Clubs that the children's Bureau was
established under the Department of
Labor ,and that Miss Julia Lathrop
was placed at its head. Since this
step was taken the club women have
watched with interest the develop
ment of the work of this Bureau, and
have co-operated with it in the at
tempt to improve the methods or btrtn
registration.
Just now the president of the Gen
eral Federation, together with the
chairman of public health, home econ
omics and civics are calling upon club
women to take part in a great nation
wide movement for the prevention of
the sickness and deaths of babies.
March 4 to 11 has been named as baby
week throughout the United States,
and it is hoped that through the
women of the federated clubs such
widespread and hearty interest may
be aroused that thousands of lives
may be saved next summer and that
nn end mav be nut to the awful waste,
suffering and sorrow that are really
preventable. When one thinks of the
cost of getting a single life launched,
of the anxiety, pain, work and money
and then considers that in some parts
of the United States the death rate of
infants under one year of age is 250
out of every 1,000, one is simply ap
palled. One ought to be appalled,
especially when one reflects that in
New Zealand the rate is only fifty-one
per thousand. Are not babies us valu
able in the United States as they arc
in other parts of the world? The club
women think they arc, and so they are
going to throw their whole hearts into
this proposed campaign in the interest
of baby-saving, which has for its ob
ject the teaching to mothers and
fathers the fundamental facts in re
gard to the care of babies, and bring
ing home to the community a knowl
edge of the totally unnecessary deaths
of its babies and a realization of how
to prevent this waste.
Baby weeks have been held in Chi
cago, New York City, Pittsburgh,
Grand Rapids and many other places,
and in every case they have received
the earnest co-operation of various
elements in the community. Baby
saving appeals to every one, and so it
ought not to be hard to arouse the in
terest necessary to make the baby
week of next March a wonderful suc
cess. But it will mean work for the
club women and everybody else.
The Children's Bureau stands ready
to help by furnishing plans and sug
gestions, and clubs will find many
organizations glad to join them in this
undertaking, which means so much for
the nation. Every club in the United
States ought to take hold, appointing
committees this fall to make a pre
liminary survey of all organizations
which might be asked to co-operate
and to secure such co-operation, harly
January the work should begin in
earnest. The baby week celebration
may be a simple affair, consisting of
newspaper articles on topics bearing
on child-saving, sermons in the
churches, celebrations' in the schools,
' and a mass meeting at which the
mayor and health officers shall speak.
Or it may be more elaborate with a
parade, Baby Sabbath, Milk Station
Day, Nursery Day, Outing Day, with
excursions for the mothers and babies
where the weather permits, and so
forth.
Now is the time to begin. Let every
club take the matter up at its next
meeting. The two and a half million
women of the General Federation,
most of them mothers, are the natural
leaders in an undertaking of this kind,
and may be depended upon to make it
a success in every point of view.
"Save the Country by Saving the Ba
bies" is a slogan appealing to every
club woman, and they are sure to re
spond with intelligence and enthusi-

HOMESTEADS ON COCONNIO
NATIONAL FOREST
During the months of October, No
vember and December, 1915, a total
of 545 acres of land within the Coco
nino National Forest, Arizona, were
listed with the Secretary of the In
terior and will shortly be opened to
entry under the Forest Homestead
Act. The lands thus listed were ap
plied for individually by four appli
cants, and each one of these tracts
was examined by a Forest officer and
found to be more valuable for agri
culture than for Forest purposes.
Those whose applications within the
Coconino National Forest were favor
ably acted upon during the months of
October, November and December are:
Joe Wattcnbergcr, Quaylc, Arizona.
A. S. Worthington, FIugstafT, Ari
zona. H. R. Stowe, Phoenix, Arizona.
Ed. Wilson, Winslow, Arizona.
In addition to this, 3029 acres were
listed to applicants within other Na
tiqiial Forests in Arizona and 3028
acres within National Forests in New
Mexico.
Soldier Kills Soldier
Because, as he claims, he has been
hounded by Sergeant William Law
rence for nearly two years, Private
.Michael Murphy, Company K, Eight
eenth infantry, rose quickly from his
place at table in the mess hall of his
company Sunday at 12:15 p. m. and
fired two shots from a 38-calibcr re
volver into the body of the sergeant,
who was seated opposite him. Luw
rence died within a few minutes while
being carried into the regimental
hosptal. Murphy was disarmed by
Sergeant Langosh, who was sitting
next to him, placed under arrest and
taken to the guard house. Later he
was turned over to Constable Hay
hurst and Chief of Police W. S. Kirby
being now in jail.

Will Settle Mine Strike
Striking miners at Clifton and Mo
renci have unanimously agreed to sur
render their Western Fedc'ration
charter and will join the State Fede
ration of Labor. This eliminates the
main point of contention between the
mine managers and the miners,
though the question of wages has not
been settled. Mine managers refused
absolutely to go into a conference
with the strikers until the Western
Federation was eliminated from the
district entirely. It is hoped that the
men will now be treated fairly as to
wages.

FRISCO PEAKS CAN BE
SEEN FROM PHOENIX
That the San Francisco peaks, 150
miles away, can be seen from Phoe
nix, is the statement of Paul Mathers
of State Engineer Lamar Cobb's office.
"The peaks, with the great depth
of snow covering them at the present
time, can be seen from the capitol
building on a clear day," said Math
ers today.
Mathers formerly lived at FlagstafT
and says he can tell the peaks by
their shape. - He states that Squaw
peak, a few miles north of Phoenix,
hinders the view from the business
section of the city.
The San Francisco peaks are about
12,000 feet high and afford a point of
interest to tourist traveling through

WOULD LET PUBLISHERS
TRADEJTH RAILROADS
Congressman Adair of Indiana has
introduced a bill in congress providing
that newspaper publishers may trade
advertising space with railroads for
transportation. Newspaper men have
gotten used to either walking or pay
ing their fare and it is probable that
the bill will not receive any enthusi
astic support from them now. The
bill is rather interesting and is as
follows: .
Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the Unit
ed States of America in Congress
assembled, That section one of an Act
approved June twenty-ninth, nineteen
hundred and six, entitled "An Act to
amend an Act entitled "An Act to re
gulate commerce," approved February
fourth, eighteen hundred and eighty
seven, and all Acts amendatory there
of, and to enlarge the powers of the
Interstate Commerce Commission," be
amended by inserting in the fourth
paragraph thereof, after the sentence,
"Provided That this provision shall
not be construed to prohibit the inter
change of passes for the officers,
agents, and employees of the common
carriers, and their families; not to
prohibit any common carrier from car
rying passengers free with the object
of providing relief of general epid
emic, pestilence, or other calamitous
visitation," the following:
"And provided further, That this
Act shall not be construed to prevent
newspapers, magazines, and other
publications admitted to the mails as
second-class matter from entering in
to legitimate and bona fide advertising
contracts with common carriers at
their usual and customery advertising
rates adn receiving payment for such
advertising from such common car
riers in transportation over the lines
thereof, such transportation to be
issued to such publications at the re
gular published rates announced to
the public by such common carriers
as the rates for transportation."
Installs New "Addressograph"
The Arizona Central" Bank has in
stalled a new "addressograph" to their
equipment. From a die cutting ma
chine name plates arc made and
placed in the "addressograph" which
automatically feeds the address plates
into the machine when operated by a
foot treadle. While it is a complicated
soit of a contrivance it does away
with typewriting addresses on the
larce volume of mail that goes
through the bank monthly.
PARDON BOARD AND KERMEEN
HAVE SIMULAR SYMPTOMS
Walter W. Kermcen was reprieved
by the pardon board at 2:30 Friday
afternoon until March 10, following
rctcipt of telegram from Governor
Emmet G. Boyle and Lieutenant Gov
ernor M. J. Sullivan, both of Carson
City, Nevada.
Kermcen was to have been hanged
at 3 o'clock.
Both Governor Boyle and his lieu
tenant declared that Kermcen is un
balanced mentally and clemency
should be extended.
Several communications were re
ceived tending to show that Kermcen
is insane, notwithstanding a jury ver
dict in the Pinal county Superior
court a few weeks ago that he is sajic.
Between now and March 10 the
pardon board will further investigate
the question of the man's insanity.
Attorney General Wiley Jones,C. O.
Case and Frank Trott, the three mem
bers of the pardon board spent the
day in Phoenix and were in confer
ence considering communications from
persons making eleventh hour attempt
to save Kermeen from the gallows.
ABANDON1 ATTEMPT TO
NAVIGATE THE COLORADO
! Report hos been received from
Grand Canyon that Charles Rus-
sell and party have at last
: abandoned the undertaking of
: navigating the Colorado river in
: small boats. Their fourth attempt
failed recently when one of their
boats wedged against arock un-
der water causing the loss of all
cameras and films. The boat was
dislodged after five days work.
! The party continued down the
riyer but met with another acci-
dent before reaching the Bass
Trail, in which their boat was
lost.
The Russell party seems to
have had bad luck all along in
attempting to make the perilous
trip, but were fortunate in not
losing their lives in the venture.

PRICE RIS L0N6 AND
RDMANTICJRIME RECORD
E. S. Price, who came to Williams
under the assumed name of Jas. Wil
liams, several weeks ago is now be
hind the bars. He is wanted in several
different states, on several different
charges. The young girl 'whom he
brought with him as his wife and who
still thought herself his wife even
after his arrest, is wanted by heart
broken parents who beg her to return
home.
As Mr. James Williams, Mr. Price
posed as a man of wealth, who had
come to Williams to buy a large num
ber of horses. Strangly for a man of
wealth, his purse was empty. This he
explained by the story that while he
was in fact burdened with riches, all
his wealth was in Florida awaiting his
call and he hesitated to telegraph this
call for the reason that he did not
want the parents of his wife to locate
him till after the first of January.
His reason for this was that his wife
was but seventeen when he married
her and her folks had objected. After
January first she would be of mar
riagable age, eighteen and her parents
could then no longer exercise authori-
ty over her. His lies were believed by
many to the extent of extending him
considerable credit. His chauffeur,
Ross Towery, proved particularly un
fortunate. Mr. Towcry's home is in Los An
geles. He owns a number of auto
mobiles and makes a practice of rent
ing them out. He rented one to Mr,
bn-kwjlliams for a trip to Arizona and

Mr. Williams' cattle story did not
ring true to Bobby the Cop and he
kept his eye on the man. None of the
horse deals went for want of money
on the part of the buyer and soon his
story began to be doubted generally.
When at last Justice Twitty received
a telegram asking for the man's ar-j
rest on a grand larceny charge, Bobby
Burns was ..immediately notified and
Price was Immediately placed behind
the bars. His tearful companion beg
ged to be locked up with him but was

arrest was made last Sunday and that
