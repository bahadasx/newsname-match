Soldiers to Remain Here
According to Information re
ceived from tho War Department
by the commanding o ulcer of tho
Thirteenth Cavalry no movement
of tho troops will be made at the
present time. The mossngo was
rocoived Wednesday morning.
The affairs in Mexico do not
seem to be as quiet as was sup
posed and the movement of tho
troops from a warm climate to a
cold oue at litis time of the year
is ample reason for the change
of plans, especially when there
Is no imperative cnuso for the
change of station.
The work of building quarters
is about finished with the excep
tions of the rwifs. The rooting
was shipped almost one month
ago but has not yet arrived. As
soon 'as it gets here it will be
but a short lime until the boys
will ull bo comfortably housed.
A Drouth Resisting Wheat
The Denver Field and Farm
says: Some day in the near
future our high plains regions
will grow a ariely of wheat so
drouth resistant that it will
tlourlsh in a country of less than
six inches of rainfall. If such a
prophecy comes true, it means
the reclamation of this great
plains region trom New Mexico
into Canada and the pouring of
untold tnilMons of bushels of
wheat into the granaries of the
world.
-Building to Remain Open
The New Mexico building at
tho San Diego exposition is to
lie kept open another year. The
committee now lias Sri.OOO In
sight and from what it is ex
pected will be raised by the
different towns and counties in
tho state, funds will be provided
to keep tho building open. Now
that the exposition at Sail Fran
cisco has been closed it is
thought that the advantage
gained by advertising at San
Diego will bo greater this year
than it was last, It being the chief
alti action o.i the coast.
Troop G Wins Football Game
Troop G defeated Troop IC in
a very Interesting foot bull game
Wednesday afternoon The
game was one sided, though the
losirg troop made a much belter
showing than the eoro of 44 to
0 would indicate. Troop G has
won tho championship for tin
year Hllf) 10.
Miss Denton, who has been
employed in tho store of Loin
mnii & liomney for the past -w
months, has piiumnulii, and hoi

Deep Well Now Assured
Messrs. Wilson, l-'arn worth &
Jones, who havo been hore tof
tho nast ten davs. havo secured
or have the promise of till tM
leases thoy required and the
test well for oil is now a certain
ty. They have nearly all the
lenses signed up ana tlios thoy
desire that havo not yet been
will be at once as tho owners of
the property aro very anxious uf
sea something started and havo"
expressed themselves as ready
to sign up. "
Their lease is said to be tin;
best that has yet been offered trie
property owners hero. It pro
vides for tho sinking of a well;
o),U00 feet deep and tho work to
begin within ninety days from
January 7th. If oil in paying
quantities is developed a woll is
to be sunk on each quarter sec-1
tion every year for eight years.
Tho lease does not contain a
rental cluuse and tho company)
have bound themselves to either
develop the Held or forfeit their
leases.
.Mr. Wilson stated mat as soon
as tho other leases wero RtgnedL.alsod oil weeould uso and put
they would begin their arrange-ftlp
ments to drill and itis an absolute
fact that these people mean busi
ness and will make an elfort to
develop the tield.
Tho people generally aro very
enthusiastic now over the situa
tion. Tlni outcome of the drill
lug will bo awaited with consid
erable Interest.
Protection For Trees
Fruit growers in this vicinity
have suffered some little loss of
young fruit trees through the
damage done by rabbits. Many
of theorchardists have protected
their trees by enclosing the en
tire orchard with woven wire
fences but in spite of this pre
caution the little pests often
gain entrance and ruin the trees
by gnawing the bark. Tho Do
partment of Agriculture has
recently Issued a formula of a
poison tree wash which has
proved highly .-otisfaclory in the
west and promises to bo one of
the most popular mothods of
protecting trees from rabbits.
Dissolve ono ounce of strych
nine sulp Late in tin (c quarts of
boiling water and add one halt
pint of laundry starch, previous
ly dissolved In cold water. Hoil
this mixture until It becomes
a clear paste. Add oue ounce of
glycerine and stir thorougi l.y.
When sufticlortly cool apply to
the trunks of the trees with a
pnint brush. Rabbits that
gnaw tho bark will be killed
before they have done any
damago to the tiees.
TheTwolvo Trump Club will
meet witli Mrs. Lingo next Fri
day at 2 o'clock sharp.
and get our ' orices
ing a suggestion to the good
people of Columbus and the
fsrmors and truck growers 'of
the Lower Mlinbres Valley, for
some time and dooided an open
otter in your vnlUHble papor
would bo the best way to do it.
I understand that some per
sons havo said tho farmer would
Havo to go, as this country
would not do for farming. That
after the soldiers left there
would be no market, for what
witi raise etc.
Now I wish to say that 1 have
lived in this beautiful valley
nearly six years; that I came
hero from Oklahoma when my
mother sold her farm for if 5,000
and In the sixteen years we
lived there wo never raised and
ripened one tomato, or cabbage
enough to make a mess of cold
slaw. We did raise wheat large
crops some years, but except
melons and early garden we
never raised very much in tho
ifrwk line. Now here we have
for- oursulves: feed ono cow,
Efn(! lorfie an,i three dozen chick
cm until January tlrst. The
year we came here wo also sold
between SbT and $70 worth of
produce off of ono acre of
ground, irrigating with one
wind mill and a 4 inch pump.
That wind jnlll. never cost us
vii) upon even nor a. - j .
wij. was by thla tlme tQ ,errgy;
year when iTiished on. tho llttlo can-
(SuOk.tifter it, except" 67,ilte.hsr
leathers. Cheap pumping, was
t not?
Now my suggestion is that
Columbus help the farmers to
find a market for their produce.
I have eaten tomatoes that were
canned in the Now England states
since I came here. Think of it,
when we can raise world beater
tomatoes right here, also pump
kins, sweet potatoes, in fact
everything that grows in a
garden.
So why not put in u cannery
in Columbus to can our surplus
produce. And here is another
business that could be carried
and u more ideal climate
i ould not be found, the manufac
ture of macaroni, noodles, yea6t
cukes etc.
You might say let the farmer
put in his own cannery, but let
mo tell you he works from
daylight untill after dark irrigat
ing and taking care of what he
raises. Of course they might
put in a co operative cannery
and litre some one to operato it.
I think, though my judgement
might not amount to much, that
tills is worthy of your consider
ation. So let us up and bo doing, as
it will soon be time to put out
our hot beds, let all the people
of the Lower Mimbres pull to
gether.
One thing which it might be
well to mention here, Is, next
year you men who Have a vote
will ho electing men to make
our laws, It would be woll to see
that men were put in office that
would make laws protecting the
farmer as well as the stock man.
Very truely yours mks. w. i.

We have investigated tho
mattor of costs of installing
caiuiorv auttlt that would bo of
sunlolont size to meet the ro
quirenionts of this place at the
present tlmu. It would bo
necessary to havo a capital of at
least S2,R00. Editor.
There will be ti dance tit Sun
n.vsldo tonight. Everybody Is
cordially Invited to attend.
At a special meeting f the
Columbus Hoard of Education
hold Tuesday afternoon ail add I
tional toachor was employed to
leach in the public school. The
attendance has been gradually
increasing all the while, and
also the law of compulsory at
tendance was brought to hear a
little stronger than it had boon
in tho past. Mrs. C, H. Dodd
ington was employed as the fifth
toaoher, and It appears tllat the
board made a very wise choice
in selecting Mrs. Boddinulon,
-lie being well qualilied and lias
I mi i a wide experiouce In this
line of work.
The fact tout the Columbus
school is growing proven beyond
doubt that tho town and com
munity is growing. At the close
of the school term in April 1012
only one teacher and ono room
was required to take care of our
school population. An increase
of four teachers in three years
is a good showing and the pos
sibllities are that at least six
teacher., will be necessary next
term.
Doth the new and old school
buildings are boing used this
year and witli the employment
of an additional teacher makes it
necessary to put two teachers in
the same room, the large room
up stairs in the new building
being now used for thatpurpow;.
A larger building will be needed
"Xt year and it is now time that
J made for the ar-
f Good Ofc-uj. TJ19. new
building was so constructed that
an addition can be built on the
north side, mid mjiiio means
raising the necessary funds for
the construction of an addition
will have to bo met. The new
building was considered large
enough for somo time to come
when it wus built, and though
just completed less than two
years ago, tho new board find
themselves crowded and In need
of more room.
There will be a large class
ready for high school next term
and in fact there is a good sized
class taking high school work
this year. Columbus will need
a high bchool and efforts should
be tiuido for the establishment
of same. The growth of a town
depends to a large extent
upon Its seat of learning, und
the people and citizens of Colum '
bus and the valley should assist
ti c board in every way possible
in carrying out their plans for
the improvement of tho school
when they get them formed.
A Gentleman
In one of our exchangos wo
note the following detinitlon of a
gentleman, which is so good
that wo herewith publish sumo:
The word gontloman" is
doilnod in tills way: A man who
is clean both inside and out; who
neither looks up to tho rich nor
down on the poor; who can
lose without squealing and win
without bragging; who is con
siderate of women, children and
old people; who Is too brave to
He, too generous to elioat, and
who tnkos his share of tho world
and lets other people havo theirs.
Ladies Aid

Let's Help Each Other
Tho Huucoes of the citizens of
tills valley will doRind largely,
for some time to come, upon
tiiulr co operation. The man
who tills the soli must have a
market for Ills products or lie
will bo forced to go out of busi
ness. Tito inoruhants ought to
bo able to handle everything
grown. Tho grain dealors can
take the grain that Is grown
here and uso it to tin advantage.
The grocor.v stores ought to be
able to take tho garden stu(Tn
from the growor, giving him tli
money that lias been going to
the railroad company. It is to
your interest and mine, und to
evoryone that the farmer be
encouraged and assisted in every
way possible, for he has been,
possibly. always will bo the back
bono of the valley.
One thing that every buyer
should do, as much so as possi
hie, insist upon homo grown
products. Of course we ull
understand that tho products in
past have not been sufficient to
supply the local demand, but
many of the g.owers havo had
a difficult job to sell what they
produced. If wo insist upo.i
home grown products tho farm
ei- will be encouraged to greater
efforts and they will become
more prosperous and so will
you. There is many things we
buy that can be produced here
and it is to our interest to en
courage their production, Pa
tronize home industry. Buy it
Grown in the Valley.
""VottrT;iadStorm
Tuesday was ono of thu worst.
days Columbus has had this
winter. There was a strong
southwest wind in the morning
and before noon it had changed
about to a northwest wind, which
brought snow and rnm. The
wind kept up pretty steady all
day and the temperature fell to a
few points above zero. Many or
the oldest settlers say it was
ono of the worst days they over
saw here.
