The thaw about to legin. accord

One feature of the presence of

IS GOING HERE
Will Investigate South Bend's
Facilities For Caring
For Convention.
.South P.end's facilities for' holding
the convention of the Playground
and Recreation Association of Amer
ica in June will be Investigated by a
representative of the organization
next week. The executive commit
tee of the association met in New
York Tuesday night to consider the
applications of South Bend and To
ledo for the national congress.
Friday morning F. 11. Harnes, mu
nicipal director of recreation, re
ceived the following telegram from
II. S. Iiraicher, secretary of the as
sociation, telling of the action of
the committee: "Delayed reply until
after meeting just held. Association
will send representative next week
to consider with you the possibility
of holding the national recreation
congress in South Fend."
Although the telegram is indefin
ite a to this city's real chances of
getting this convention, Mr. Barnes
said that he believed South P.end
was being considered ahead of To
ledo. He r.'eived notice from the
secretary pi the association last
week tha it had practically been
decided to give the national con
gress to either South L!end or To
ledo. The representative will first con
fer with the municipal . recreation
committee at special meeting when
the city's facflitles for holding the
convention will be disvussed. He
will later meet with the directors of
the Chamber cf Commerce and city
officials.
According to .Mr. Karnes, the con
vention will l.e stielt a big thintf that
it will be necessary to have the
Chamber of Commerce, the mayor
and the council back of the prop
osition. It is probable . that a spec
ial appropriation would be asked
from the council if the congress is
brought here.
Springbrook park probably will be
the place where all of the biff meet
ings are held, if Smith Bei.d lands
the convention. It would be neces
sary to arrange a sounding board at
the park The sectional meetings
and group sessions would be held at
the high school, where headquar
ters would also be established.
At tlie same time the convention
is on, the St. Joseph county histor
ical pageant will be staged. This
event would be something entirely
new at a national convention of the
Playground and Recreation associa
tion. None of the cities that have
had the convention has ever put on
a pazeant at the some time.
Miss Margaret Wilson, daughter
of Prps't Wilson, who was secured
to speak here sometime this spring,
probable would tome here at the
time vf the convention. Theodore
Roospvplt and other prominent
speakers probably will appear on the
program.

TO CAST VOTE
AGAINST ELBEL
Mayor to Act on Question of
Turning Playgrounds Over
to Recreation Commit
tee if Necessary.
BOARD IS DIVIDED
2 TO 2 ON QUESTION
Dr. E. J. Lent Sides With
President of Board Wants
Decision on Proposition
to be Unanimous.
Mayor Keller has ex-plained the
exact position of the members of
the park board relative to the pro
posed transfer of supervision over
the park playgrounds from the
board to the recreation committee.
Pres't Richard Elbel is the one man
on the board who strongly opposed
the movement, while Dr. E. J. Eent
has followed with the chief, taking
the position that the project should
receive unanimous sanction. W. W.
Ufdenour and Irvln W. Jackson
favor the proposed ac'ion.
"I am in favor of t ie proposal,"
declares Mayor Kellc. "When it
was brought to nr.y attention that the
park board had ben unable to de
cide the question I intended settling
the difficulty at once but have since
decided to wait until the next meet
ing of the board. At that time the
proposition will be threshed out."
Thus far Mayor Keller has not
cast the deciding vote in the matter
but should the park board fall to
agree he has the power to throw in
the ballot, which will swing the pen
dulum for or against the proposed
change in authority over the park
playgrounds. Indications are that
If Pres't Elbel and Dr. Lent do not
change their attitude upon the sub
ject before. Uxe next meeting. . th
mayor will be compelled to use his
power to settle the question.
Board Pays 1 Ox jkmi .
The new arrangement as explained
by the mayor is that the park play
ground" shall be transferred from
the supervision of the park board to
that of the recreation committee.
The recreation department shall
have full jurisdiction over the man
agement of the playgrounds while
the pafk board shall pay the ex
penses of the upkeep of the property
as In the past, the only change be
ing in the source of management.
According to the mayor, Pres't
Elbel believes that if the park
board expends its funds on the up
keep of the playgrounds, it should
have full authority over them: It
appears that he has taken the atti
tude of "whole job r none" and
this is the question, that will be
threshed out at the next meeting of
the board at which it is expected
Mayor Keller will be present.

lecently introduced in the council,
which failed to pass. Should the
new arrangement go through, the
park playgrounds would be under
the supervision oY F. B. Barnes,
municipal director and South Bend's
playground expert.
Pres't Elbel continues reticent
upon the proposed change in super
vision but recently predicted that
the anticipated movement mUht not
po through at the next board meet
ing. It has heen pointed out that
by tlie change in supervision Park
Sup't Perley would be relieved of
part of the heavy labors which are
heard of so often at the city hall as

Came Late in Life.
Iritcrtiiitional News Service:
EE PASO. Texas. Jan. 14. Ar
rangements for the funeral of Gen.
Victoriano Huerta, former Mexican
dictator, w ere to be made today. The
ex-provisional president of the
southern republic died at his home
here of sclerosis of the liver at 8:25
o'clock last night.
Eike Julius Caesar, Huetra's
prominence rame late in life. He
was always proud to say he was an
American Indian. His parents were
poor - peon - of Colotlan. Jalisco,
where he was born on Dec. 22. 1S54.
He roamed the streets barefoot as a
child but the village priest taught
him to rad and write and he con
ceded somehow the ambition to
we;tr the epaulets of a Mexican army
o llicer.
When Huerta was IS years old.
Gen. Don;ito Cuerra passed through
Colotlan with his troops and there
sought a man who could do some
writing for him. This proved the
boy's great opportunity. He pleased
the Mexican general and revealed
his longings. Guerra persuaded
Pres't Juarez to appoint Huerta a
cadet nt Chapultepec military acad
emy, where he was graduated with
honors in 1ST;. His first engage
ment was Teeoae. Tlie revolutionists
of Tuxtepee defeated there the fed
eral forces.
From this time to 1S9Ö Huerta
led the life of an army officer In
many garrisons. In 1SSCJ as a col
onel he took part in the campaign
against Canuto Neri, the bandit of
the State of Guerrero. So success
ful was he that in 1901 he was sent
against Rafael lel Castro, another
Guerrero rebel. The same year ho
quelled a revolt of Maya Indians in
Yucatan and the next year he was
brevetted a general of brigade in
recognition of his services.
Bernardo Reyes. Felix Diaz and
Manuel Mondragon attempted a
coup-d'etat Feb. '.. m ?., and Madero
delivered his defense into the hand
fo Huerta. After frightful bloodshed
Huerta turned traitor to Madero, ar
rested him and his cabinet and forc
ed the leaders of the revolt into ex
ile. A few days later tlie kindly
Madero. with his wife pleading on
her knees for his life from tlie dic
tator was shot "trying to escape."

Sen. Stone Defends Adminis
trationSays World Has

tion of War.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. A reso
lution by Sen. Works of California,
directing the president to intervene
in Mexico renewed the battle on the
Mexican situation in the senate to
day. Sen. Works declared he had al
ways shared with the president that
the policy of watchful waiting would
win. but that now he has come to a
realization that such a hope no
longer has any foundation.
"The responsibility for solving the
Mexican problem is too &reut fo'r the
president to bear iilone." he said.
"Congress alone has the power to
declare war.
"Intervention means war. but con
gress must assume its responsibility
courageously and without delay," he
added.
. . . . Responsibility Own.
Sen. Works opposed appealing to
the Pan-American countries for co
operation because the responsibility
was entirelv our own.
The resolution besides directing in
tervention authorizes the president
to make use of the land and naval
forces of the United States and to
maintain them in Mexico until
stable and efficient government
established.
Sen. Lodge of Massachusetts,

askinff that his resolution of April
21, 1914, directing intervention be
reprinted in the Record said:
"Our war with Mexico has been
brought to a successful conclusion
because our enemy, Gen. Huerta,
has died in jail."
Sen. Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee, fol
lowed Sen. Tvodge and made an im
passioned plea in defense of Pres't
Wilson's position. He eulogized the
president for having "steered the
ship of state among the dangers of
recent years with a strong hand and
a clear eye."
He pleaded for ratienee and at
the same time questioned the mo
tives of those senators who a few
years ago were against intervention
and who now are demanding that
the armed forces of the nation be
sent into the blood-stained southern
republic.
1111)1 ie Approves.
"I am puzzled to know," he be
gan, "whether there is a disposition
to stir up sentiment to promote
armed conflict with the people of
Mexico. I only hope there is no
extensive motive of that kind. If T
must take cognizance of it, I think if
there is one thing above all others
that has been done by this admin
istration that has received the gen
eral approval of the American peo
ple, it is the great and continuous
effort of the president to keep this
country out of war if it can pos
sibly be done with honor to the
I'nited States and without sacrifice
of the interests of the American
people.
