BOHLER HONORED BY
BASKET BALL HEADS
Washington State's Athletic Director
Attracts Attention of National
Association—Gets Important
Appointment
J. F. Bohler, member rules com
mittee, national intercollegiate bas
ket ball association, if you please.
Some honor that, but who would
deny that Washington State's highly
efficient athletic director, "Dr. Har
mony," Is entitled to any honor that
he may receive. Mr. Bohler received
official notification Thursday that
he had been selected as a member of
the' rule? committee or the national
intercolloglatc basket ball associa
tion, of which Dr. Reycroft or Prince
ton university is chairman. The po
sition is one or the most important
in the girt of the national association
and the basket ball heads exercised
rare good judgment when they se
lected the Pullman man for the job.
The association committee meets
each year ln New York to make
changes In the Intercollegiate basket
ball rules and Director Bohler will
prove a mighty valuable man during
the deliberations. The committee
consists of five members from the
biggest institutions in the United
States.
That Mr. Bohler, through pis ex
ceptional work at W. S. C, is being
brought to the attention of the best
schools In the United States, is indi
cated by the fact that he has recent
ly received flattering offers from two
institutions, one in the east and one
in the west, for his services as ath
letic director and physical trainer
next year. Mr. Bohler himself neith
er affirms nor denies this report,
which nevertheless is given much cre
dence, but he quieted a whole lot of
unrest when he said "I am well satis
fied with W. S. C. and Pullman under
the present conditions and am not
looking for other positions."

thermometers in various parts ot
town registered from nine to 19 de
grees below vero. The government
thermometer at the college recorded
nine below, while several in the
downtown district showed 12 and 13
below. The lowest record reported
was that made by a thermometer in
the residence district in the flat to
the north or the college campus,
where the mercury dropped to 19 be
low. Water pipes in all parts or
town were frozen, and plumbers were
much in demand. Although the sun
shone brightly all day Tuesday the

force the mercury to rise. Early
Wednesday morning the college ther

Five hundred feet of film showing
the big W. S. C.-Brown football game
at Pasadena were received by Ath

noon, and a number of l/usiness men
were guests of the athletic head at
the first appearance of Hie "movies"
when . they were thrown upon the

First of Music Recitals Tonight
Educational Concerts Designed to
Bring Famed Musicians
Here
The first of a series of three edu
cational recitals to be given by Prof,
and Mrs. Herbst and Prof. Kirn-,
brough will occur on Friday evening,
January 14, in the college audi
torium.
The program will consist of music
by composers or the early classical
periodlargely of numbers destined
for sacred use, as all of the better
music of that day was written for
performance in the cathedrals. Three
or the greatest composers of this per
iod will be represented on the pro

The second recital of the series
will be given on Mraeh 3 and will
consist entirely, of works of Mozart.

series will be given March 31, the
program comprising works by mod
ern masters.
Season tickets for the series of
of this college and faculty is favor
ably known throughout the east as
well as in the west, more favorably
perhaps than any of you realize. I
presume that the college is even bet
ter known now than before the foot
ball season opened. I come from. a.
position where I had supervision
over 30.000 students, because I be
lieve that in this new state; there is
a wider field of useful service in
working with a smaller number of
students. 1 am in sympathy with
your former president's conception
of what this college should be and
ask your co-operation in carrying on
his work. I have no policy to an
nounce at this time and have no de
sire to make a speech. I have said
all that I care to say but hope to be
come weH ' acquainted with all of
you." ***

the members of the faculty of each
department. Tomorrow evening the

DAMON AND PYTHIAS
AT GRAND THEATRE
ctiu-i/.atioii of Story on Which
Order of Knights of Pythias Is
I ounded*Will Be Showed
Monday Evening
"Damon and Pythias," a six-reel
picturizatlon of the story on which
the order of the Knights of Pythias is
founded, will be shown at the Grand
theatre next Monday evening, Janu
ary 17. Prices of admission will be
15 cents for adults and five cents for
children, and three complete shows
will be run. The picture Is a $100,
--000 masterpiece, and tells with won
derful accuracy and completeness the
world's greatest story or universal
friendship. Under the reign of the
tyrant, Dionysius, Damon, a senator
of Syracuse, was under sentence of
death. The pleadings of his closest
friend, Pythias, caused a stay of the
sentence until Damon could! bid tare
well to his loved ones, Pythias vol
untarily placing himself in bondage
as pledge for the return of his con
demned companion. Just as the
hour of execution approaches, and
Pythias is being led to the block to
suffer for his friend, Damon returns
and offers himself to save the friend
who had trusted him with his lite.
In this story of true friendship ex
isting between the brilliant senator
and great soldier Is Interwoven a
beautiful and dramatic love story.
Pythias is called upon to choose be
tween the beautiful Calanthe, on
their wedding day, and his word of
honor; Damon is put to no lighter
test in withstanding the pleadings of
his wife and child.
Around this unparalleled display
of rrlendshlp the story Is woven, and
1500 people comprised the cast that
staged the story before the camera.
Spectacular, stirring, gripping are its
scenes; laid in Greece in the pomp
and glory of her greatest day, with
Its colossal groupings, ; classic
lances, the thrill of the chariot race,
battles upon sea and {land, pities
built and destroyed, and through all
this, with dramatic fire and touch of
sentiment runs the story of human
friendship and Its lesson of man's
humanity to man. ',-.'■:..
