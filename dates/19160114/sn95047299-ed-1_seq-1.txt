VILL BE SEEN AND READ BY THOUSANDS..
Matfor Bowden of Jacksonville has
called a convention of Mayors of sev
eral southern states to meet in Jack
sonville next Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday to consider matters of im
portance to every mayor. This
meeting has been also justly called a
Civic Conference, and many matters
will be lip for discussion
Mayor Bowden in a letter to ine
News says:
"The reason for calling this con
vention was not for the purpose of
considering the wandering hobo that
travels from place to place by his own
efforts or of his own volition, but for
the purpose of regulating and putting
a stop to the sending of the dependent
from one community to another.
Those who have not come in contact
with this evil cannot appreciate the
extent of this evil for the reason that
they know nothing of the conditions.
There is a humane side to this subject
and the humane side is the principal
reason that induced me to issue this
call. People without a penny
earth; women with little children de
pendent upon them are sent Dy one
community to another leaving the
community where they , have friends
and someone that understands their
condition, dropping them at the depot
in a strange community with no place
to go except the police station; no
one is interested in tnem or cares r
thing about them. This does not oc
cur only occasionally but it is done
every day.
lap "Only week before last a town in
Florida sent to Jacksonville a woman
with seven children, the oldest being
twelve vears old and all she had when
she landed here was $2.85 which had
been contributed to her by those on
the train while in transit. Of course
charitable institutions had to
t'l-e charge of this woman and these
children. A few months ago a man
over six feet tall hobbled into my of-
fice and told me that a collection had
been made for him in a South Florida
town and that he had been sent to
Jacksonville for hospital treatment;
he had an incurable disease. Lie
laws of this City or most every other
Citv prohibits the acceptance of pa-
tients sent from another community
for the reason f 6r which this man was
sent here. Having no other course,
I ascertained where this man had
originally come from before going to
South Florida, l round that ne had a
father and I sent him to his father,
Had I not done this he would have
been a care upon this community and
was sent here by some other communi-
ty in order to get rid of him There
are hundreds of just such cases that
come each year.
Mavor Merriam of Palatka will at
tend the convention and will have a
part in the discussion. He will also
have a conspicuous place at the ban'
quet table, and will respond to a toast.
Anions: prominent Mayors of South
ern cities who will be present and
who will make addresses are: Hon
Wallace J. Pierpont of Savannah,
Hon. O. B. Eaton of Winston-Salem
N. C Hon. Chas. W. Patterson of
New Orleans, Hon. Bridges Smith of
Maoon. Hon. Wm. M. McUrath of
Birmingham, Ala., and others. Flori
da will be well represented.
The addresses of welcome will be
delivered by Hon. J. E. T. Bowden,
Mayor of Jacksonville, and Hon. Chas.
H. Mann.

for the "Mile Dinner" on Tuesday

Snrinirs. who is an announced candi
date for Governor of Florida and who
has a large following among those
who are opposed to the Catholic faith

the State Executive Committee to re
convene the committee for the purpose
of repudiating the resolution adopted
at its meeting in Jacksonville on the
6th inst He stated that under the
ruling of the committee he could not
take the obligation required by the
committee, and that unless Chairman
Raney called the committee, togetncr
again he would mandamus the com
mittee to compel them to allow his
name to go on the democratic primary
ticket
BRYAN MAKES SHORT
VISIT IN PALATKA
On His Way to Gainesville!
Breakfasts at Putnam
House.
William Jennings Bryan, ex-Secre
tary of State and three times the
democratic candidate for President of
the United States, spent a couple
hours in Palatka last Saturday. Mr.
Bryan came over from St. Augustine
on the early train and left two hours
later for Gainesville.
During the interval he breakfasted
at the Putnam House and was visit
ed by many prominent local demo
crats,, among the number being Hon.
Henry Hutchinson, clerk of the court,
who has always been a great admirer
of Mr. Bryan. W. E. Wattles was
also among the number to help enter
tain the distinguished visitor.
Mr. Bryan has a beautiful winter
home at Miami and with Mrs. Bryan
is spending the season there. He
had arranged a lecturing itinery up
the east coast and over to Gainesville
and Ocala, and in making these places
stopped over in Palatka between
trains. Mr. Bryan's last visit to Pa
latka was in February, 1912, when on
his wav to Washington to assume the
duties of Secretary of State in Presi
dent Wilson's cabinet.
Two years previous to that visit he
delivered an address here and at Cres
cent City under the auspices of the
Women's Clubs.
He expects to return to Palatka
sometime next month with Mrs. Bry
an, when it is his intention to make a
trip up the St. Johns and Ocklawaha
rivers.
The News would suggest that the
Woman s Club secure him for an ad
dress at that time.
To Suit the New Owners-
Mayor Signs Ordinance.
At the recess meeting of the city
council on Monday "night the ordinance
amending the franchise of the Palatka
Gas Light & Fuel Co. was put through
its first, second and third reading and
final passage without opposition. May
or Merriam, who was present, imme
diately attached his signature to the
ordinance and it became a law.
The franchise differs from the ong-
inr.l franchise in that it runs twenty
years straight and has no ten year
purchase privileges, or options. 'J .
frr.nch.ise also calls for a standard
plant something that was omitted
from the old one and which has caus
ed no end of trouble.
The company agrees to furnish
lights for the city hall park, and
agrees to some other matters which
render the franchise more valuable to
the city.
Mr. R. E. L. Mann, who is to be tne
Palatka manager . of the Southern
Utilities Co., was present at the meet
ing and thanked the council for their
action.
V
Large Land Co. to Organize.
James B. Pierce of Elizabethtown,
Ky., a promoter and dealer in timber
farm and mi'.eral lands, was in the
city this week and a caller at the
board of trade rooms. He requested
Secretary Elliott to mail literature
and all needed information concerning
this city and surrounding country to
members of a prospective land com
pany who will visit Palatka during
the month of February for the p
nose of organizing a large land com
pany. The company is to be com
posed of many bankers of the-middle
west. .

Storey; directors, R. Lee Kennerly,

work was reported and it was seen
by the' stock holders that the com
pany is moving along satisfactorily
and is growing as fast as it has any
thing to fasten on. The outlook for
the coming year seems bright.
Attempted Suicide.
Carl Nykes, a German who appears
a trifle dippy in the attic, and wlw
maoe an attempt to commit suiciue
near Kirby and Dodge streets on
Monday afternoon by digging into his
vitals with a tea spoon, was detained
at the county jail for observation by a
duly appointed lunacy commission
During Tuesday night, while in the
jail. Nykes made another attempt on
his life with a. piece of glass. He cut
a deep hole and was bleeding like a
stuck pig, but Dr. Miller who attended
him in the absence of Dr. Steen, sew
ed him up and it was thought he
would live. His first cuts were not so
bad, but they were bad enough. . Dr.
Chandler sewed them up.

Mr. Alvers Again A Candidate.
Word comes to The News from
Crescent City, where County Commis
sioner Alvers is spending the present
week with the big road scraper mend
ing the roads in that section, that Mr.
Alvers has been prevailed on to again
become a candidate for county com
missioner. Mr. Alvers has served this
district long and faithfully and has
come to be regarded as one of the
most valued members of the board.
For the past two terms he has served
as president.
It was understood that Mr. Alvers
would retire at the end of his present
term, but it seems that his friends on
the peninsula have prevailed upon him
to again be a candidate.
Under the new law it is said that
each commissioners district will make
their own nomination; nominations
last year were made by the en;
county.

Bank Makes Fine Showing.
The annual meeting of the stock
holders of the Putnam National Bank
of Palatka was held on Tuesday, Jan.
11th, when the condition of the bank
was gone into in a thorough manner
and found to be perfectly satisfac
tory. The action of the directors in
declaring the usual 4 per cent semi

wao confirmed by the meeting.
The Putnam National Bank now ha3
deposits of over $500,000, and surplus
and undivided profits of nearly $100,
000. It is one of the strong financial
institutions of Florida.
The officers of the bank for the en

and Chas. Burt. President, Dr. Oco

son; cashier, A. S. WUlard; assistant
cashier, Chas. Burt.
Farmer's Institute Failed.
The Farmer's Institute scheduled
for last Wednesday at Bostwick, prov
ed a failure. The farmers of that;
section" were all busy planting pota
toes, and they were not inclined to
leave the job to indulge in a picnic.
Frofs. A. r. Spencer and J. K. Wat
son of the University of Florida, Ag
ricultural Department were on hand,
and so were Hons. W. G. Tilghman, P.
Jack Becks, Henry Hutchinson, Coun
ty Commissioner and Mrs. Waldron,
Mrs. Herman Collette, County Agent
for the Girls Gardening and Canning
Clubs, and several others from this
city.
But the people or Bostwick dii -attend
except for a few who make
headquarters about the store.
The Bostwick school children, how
ever, came out and listened to talks
by Messrs. Spencer, Watson, Tilgh
man, Elliott and Mrs. Collette. They
enjoyed it; it made a change for them
from the dull routine of school duties.
Prof. Spencer says that they often
meet with failure on the part of the
people to respond with their presence.
but that they will try again sometime
with better results. The University
is trying to take the information it
obtains through experiments and sci
entific research, direct to the farmers,
and help them. But some farmers are
inclined to discount information from
such sources. Their children will
know better.
RANEY REFUSES TO
C A LLJCfl M M ITTEE
To Further Consider Reso-
lution Defining a
Democrat.
Hon. Geo. P. Raney. chairman of
the State Democratic Executive Com
mittee, in a letter to Committeeman
S. Smith of Clay county, declines
to call another meeting of the commit
tee to reconsider the resolution pass
ed by the committee in session in
Jacksonville on the 6th inst. Mr.
Raney says:
Dear Sir:
I am in receipt of your letter of the
7th inst, requesting that I call a
meeting of the State Democratic Ex
ecutive Committee of Florida at once
to reconsider the vote by which the '.
resolution setting forth qualifications $
of electors was passed and for such
other business as may properly come
before said committee.
On December 14, 1915, I issued a
call for a meeting of the State Demo
cratic Executive Committee to be held
in Jacksonville January 6, 1916, and
addressed a letter to each member of
the committee according to the list of
membership furnished me by the sec
retary, naming the time and place of
such meeting and'pointing out the sev
eral matters of importance which
would necessarily come before the
committee for its determination;
among others being the duty of the
committee to declare by resolution the
terms and conditions on which legal
electors shall be taken as proper mem
bers of the Democratic party and en
titled to vote in the primary election
as members of that party.
Quotes Statute.
This was done in pursuance of the .
provisions of section 16, chapter 6469,
Laws of Florida, A. D. 191, reading
as follows:
"The State executive committee of
each political party may by resolution
declare the terms and conditions on
which legal electors shall be declared
and taken as proper members of such
party. It shall be the duty of the su
pervisors of registration of the vari
ous counties in the registration of
electors to comply with the terms of
any such resolution upon the filing
with them of copies thereof duly cer
tified by the chairman and secretary
of any such executive committee
any time before the opening of the
registration books as herein required."
Introduced Regularly.
The resolution referred to was reg
ularly introduced at the regular meet
ing of the State Democratic Executive
Committee held at the time and place
designated in the call. There was a
quorum present at this meeting; m
fact, the meeting was better attended
than any held in years. The resolu
tion referred to by you was read twice
to the committee; it was thereupon
publicly discussed and upon the chair
putting the question upon motion duly
seconded to adopt the resolution, the
same was passed by an overwhelming
vote. No motion to reconsider the
vote adopting the resolution was
made. The committee was in session
for at least an hour and a half after
the adoption of this resolution. As
far as I am advised the committee,
transacted all business that might
properly come before it.
In the nature of things there must
be a finality to all matters and for the
reason hereinbefore set forth I must
respectfully decline to comply with
your request.
Very truly yours,
(Signed,) GEORGE P. RANEY,
Efc;f:.:i '.' Chairman.
