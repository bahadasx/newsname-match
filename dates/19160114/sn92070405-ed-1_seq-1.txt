LORDSBURG
' The following booster article ap
peared in the El Paso Herald for
Sunday. This, and much other
material dealing with the incorpor
ation of Lordsburg, removal of thé
hogs from the streets, and the
building boom, has been spread
broadcast over the southwest and
has been featured in many news
papers who realize the importance
of such factors in the growth of
the city of Lordsburg, no matter
how hard the opposition tries to
hold the town down.
Lordsburg, N. M., Jan. 8. A
building boom is taking place in
this city and by the middle of the
year Lordsburg will be greatly
changed in appearance downtown.
W. H. Small is making prepara
tions for. the erecting of a $15,
000 or $20,000 two-story brick
building on the main street, a Ma-
' sonic temple is now under consider- j
ation by the order of this city and
no doubt will be built by spring,
and a new high school is to be
erected by the beginning of the
term next fall.
At Silver City this week the Co.
commissioners ordered a survey
to be made of Lordsburg and a cen
sus taken, aftér which the town
will be declared incorporated. Over
a majority of the legal voter in
this city have signed the petitions
for incorporation despite the ef
forts of the unprogrensvo element
to retard this needed movement in
Lordsburg's civic affairs.
Another important change, with
in the last two weeks, has been the
removal of all the hogs from the
streets of the city. Lordsburg
has been made a joke town of the
southwest because of the careless
citizens who have turned their
hogs into the streets to grub. As
sistant district attorney C. C. Roy
all of Silver City declared war on
the hog owners and has promised
prosecution to the first offender.
As a result Lordsburg has been re
moved from the list of the hog
towns of the west.
PROMINENT VISITORS
John M. Sully, general manager
of the Chino Copper Company
at Santa Rita and Hurley, N.
M., Horace Moses, mine superin
tendent of the same company, and
Percy Wilson, mayor of Silver City
and prominent attorney, arrived in
the city Saturday and returned to
their homes Sunday. The gentle
men came here in connection with
their interests in the Bonney mine
which is being steadily developed
under the management of ,H. A.
Thome, who for years was con
nected with the Chino Copper Co.
Lordsburg feels proud of having
such men as Messrs. Sully, Moses
and Thome in back of one of the
local mines. It may be safely said
that these men are the most suc
cessful mining men in New Mexico
and their entrance into this district
to the south qf this city will no
doubt bring others.
STIRRING REVIVAL MEETINGS
The two weeks' revival meeting
at the Methodist church has been
most successful in every respect.
Every evening the church has been
packed to hear Rev. Forman deli
ver his excellent sermons in his
forceful manner. The singing has
been fine. Rev. Forman is a good
eader and the songs introduced
have met with much favor. Every
evening special selections have
been rendered;
On Sunday afternoon a rousing
:hildren's service was held and in
:he evening the church was packed
to its capacity when the Baptists
oined in a union service with the
M. E. church.
The revival will close Sunday
evening.

Annual Convention of American
National Live Stock Associa
tion Will Bring Crowda
The annual convention of the
American National Live Stock As
sociation will be held in El Paso,
Texas, January 25, 26 and 27, 1916,
and the officers and members of
the executive committee of that or
ganization are looking for the larg
est attendance in the history of the
annual conventions of the big na
tional live stock association.
Preparing Elaborate Program
El Paso has entertained within
the very recent past, the annual
convention of the Texas Cáttle
Growers' Association and the Pan
Association and is very familiar
with the methods to be followed in
the entertaining of cattlemen. Be
sides, it lies in the center of the
greatest cattle producing area in
the world and includes in its popu
lation many of the leading cattle
tlemen.
Big Cattle Loan Company
While El Paso banks hate ex
tended much aid to the cattlemen,
there has been need here of a
large cattle loan company. J.
H. Nations, president of the
Panhandle & Southwestern Cat
tle Association, is among the
leading southwestern cattle deal
ers who advocate the formation of
a loan association to take care of
the needs of the cattlemen in this
territory.
BIG STORY TO BREAK
The Liberal's staff of literary
artists has been put wise to the
fact that there is more than a
possibility that there is a good
news story about to break into
headlines which is very favorable
to Lordsburg: and Grant County.
It has not been released and un
til that time our readers may
speculate as to what it is and
in the mean time do not let your
subscription expire for the early
part of 1916 so you may get the
full3tory when it is pushed over.
MORE PUBLICITY
In the Engineering and Mining
Journal's big annual review of
mining in the United States,
which appeared Tuesday, Lords
burg and its tributary districts
is featured in the write-up of the
state of New Mexico. This is
the most valued mining publicity
Lordsburg has ever received and
is certain to turn the mining
spot-light upon the local field.
The New Mexico review in the
Journal was another acquisition
of the Western Liberal's publicity
campaign.
DIRECTORS MEETING
Meetings of the shareholders
of the First National Bank of
Lordsburg and al3o the Directors
was held at the bank Tuesday.
Peter Jochem was elected as "a
new member of the board of
directora and the present mem
bers were all retained. Those
on the board are: H. J. McGrath,
John Robson, W. H. Small, F. R.
Coon, J. P. Mansfield, J. T.
McCabe and Peter Jochem making

J. T. McCabe and J. P. Mansfield
were present for the meetings.
The statement of the bank at
the close of business December
31st is published in thJs week's
issue of the Liberal and shows
the bank to be in excellent con
dition and growing steadily.
PRECINCT FOR 85 MINE
The County Commissioners
last week granted a new voting
precinct for the 85 mine camp.
The precinct will take in thirty
sections surrounding the 85 camp
but not taking in any of the land
through which the S P. or A. &
N. M. railroad passes. The
district begins one mile south of
Lordsburg and extends 6 miles
east and west running five miles
south. This will be only a voting
precinct and will have no effect
on the school funds.
An election for Constable and
Justice of the Peace has been set
for Saturday January 29th at
the 85 mine.
A petition has also been circu
lated tor the establishing oí a
a postoffice at the 85 mine, to be
known as Barclay, New Mexico,
and action is expected from the
postal authorities within a short
time.

Garage, will conduct the Over
land Agency for Grant County.

ments at the garage in the near

supplies and accessories as well
as a stock of Overland cars.
Mr Ownby's many friends re
gret to learn of his departure
from the automobile business
Mr. Fitzpatrick is a live ana
energetic business man and will
be a big assest to Lordsburg.
He is welcomed into local
business circles.

Paso, Texas. Cavanaugh sued for
$20,000 damages and the trial was
held in the 65th district court.
PUBLIC SCHOOL NOTES
Sewing is advancing wonder
fully under the tutilage of Mrs.
Sellards and Miss C. Conners.
Crochetting has become so well
iked that the girls do it, between
the halves of their basket-ball
games. AH sorts of aprons and
bags have been designed and
made by the class. This week the
lesson taught the girls how to
patch, neatly and so it would be
unoticed, on crossbar gingham.
Remarks have been heard to the
effect, that this extra work is
unnecessary and the girls and
boys ought to be doing their
readin, ntin and nthmetic.
If lessons in sewing, patching
and building, arent useful to our
future citizens, it would be a
benefit for us to learn what will
be.
Midyear promotions will be
made on Friday, January 14, 1916,
The names of pupils getting the
promotion, will be published in
the next issue of The Liberal.
A m e e t i n g of the Patron
Teacher Society was held at the
school house Wednesday atter
noon at four o'clock.
A new class has been started
in the high school, English
history being the subject and
Miss Huggett the teacher.
Mr. forman, the evangelist,
now preaching in Lordsburg,
addressed the pupils on Monday
an interesting and useiul talk
and his remarks were greatly
appreciated.
It would be well for the public
to visit the schools and see the
work going on. You are always
welcome, and we would be more
than glad to have your help and
sympathy.
lo the music of the cheering
crowd, and the honking of nu
merous automobile horns, the
Lordsburg basket-ball team took
vengeance on the San Simon
girls for the points they won from
us in Arizona. Ihe girls were
after the ball every minute, every
player was in her place at the
right time. Very few chances
were lost. Julia Beam, worked
on the line getting the ball and
passing it to Annie McMeans,
who deftly tossed it into the
basket. Dorothy Chase played
jumping center, until, through
the r i g o r of the game. She
collapsed eight minutes before
the final time was called
Mildred Trimble took her place
and played nobly. Inez Clay
and Kutn onase did very good
work in keeping the visiting team
from running up a large score
and in getting the ball over to
their center.
The San Simon aggregation
displayed good team-work. Their
chief fault was in their inability
to hit the basket. It was no easy
matter to win the game from
them as they worked the Lords
bursr team to its utmost.
The game ended with the score
19 to 6 in favor of Lordsburg,
with a worn out team and with
the cheers of an admiring band
of rooters.
More than one hundred rooters
attended the game Saturday and
to them we extend our thanks
for their presence and cheering.
'We hope those who were not
there, have repented and will
come next time.
Negotations are under way for
a game with Duncan Saturday.
Arizona Autoists
Eliminate Lordsburg
A motorcade of Southern Ariz
ona autoists left Phoenix, Tucson
Douglas, Bisbee, Tombstone and
other points yesterday morning
to visit towns along the Border
land Route, eliminating Lords
burg, the hub of the automobile
route to the coast. As a lame
excuse the autoists state that
the road between Lordsburg and
Rodeo is practically impassible
and therefore they propose to
hange the Borderland Route
from Kodeo through Hachita on
to Deming over a road going
through lakes and over malpais
country, many times worse than
the present Borderland Route.
It is then fear of the Southern
Highway and the S. P. Road
thru Steins, San Simon, Bowie
and on to Tucson, that has turned
the Douglas and Bisbee autoists
against Lordsburg. The narrow
minded towns in southern Ariz
ona cannot stand competition.
and boldly display it.
Lordsburg has worked for and
will continue to work for the
Borderland Route. In the Spring
the roads will be repaired both
for the benefit of the autoists
and the Animas valley farmers.
When a tourist comes to this city
he is shown the maps and logs
of all routes and is given to chose
for himself. It is this fairness
that the southern Arizona towns
are afraid of.
Lordsburg is playing square
put is not meeting with fair play.
Bill For More State Lands
State Land Commissioner
Robert P. Ervein, has submitted
to senator Fall, a bill for addition
al State Lands for New Mexico.
The bill will be printed to con
gress within a vejhort time
and there are good possibilities
of it being enacted. A proviso
in the bill calls for the exchange
of lands on the National Forest
with the State and if the bill is
passed exchange of land can be
made giving those located on the
National forest an opportunity
to buy their lands.

gineer of El Paso and well known
in Lordsburg, was married in
Toronto, Canada Saturday to
Miss Mimmie Adoo of Galveston,
Texas. Miss Adoo is a daughter
of the well known Texas Capital
ist. The Liberal with Mr.
Crowdus' hundreds of friends
in his section, extend congratulations.
NEWS FOR MINERS
A recent decision made by
Assistant Attorney General
Clancy of New Mexico is to the
effect that where assessment
work is not done on a mining
claim until the latter part of
December and laps on to the new
year the claim is not rendered
open for re-location provided all
good intentions are made by the
owner of the property.

Mr. and Mrs. John B. Crowell
are the proud parents of a fine
big boy which arrived on January
8th, Dr. DeMoss in attendance.
The youngester will answer to
name of Richard Bruce Crowell
and the Liberal is pleased to
announce that both he and the
mother are doing nicely. John
certainly did himself proud in
celebrating the event and his
friends have a supply of cigars
laid up for weeks to come.
