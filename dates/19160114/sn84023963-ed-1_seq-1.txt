A Suggestive Argument

The present session of congress will
be the most important in its scope
since the civil war.
Millions will be appropriated for de
fense. The traditional policies of the
government will probably be revolutionized.
The Army and Navy
will have more money at their
disposal during the next few
years than ever hefore during
time of peace.
Our diplomatic relations "With
some of the countries at war

"W-r may possibly follow such
ac'ln on our part.
Peace May Be Declared

the countries now at war, and it

is from force of circumstances,
confined to a small radius.

The reason is that the distance be
