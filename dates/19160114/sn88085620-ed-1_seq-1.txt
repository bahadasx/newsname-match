WOULD REGULATE WAGES
BY LEGAL ACT
Favors a New Constitutional Amend
ment to Cure Poverty
Rev. Herbert S. Bigolow, address
ing an audience in the Grand Opera
House, Cincinnati, on the subject,
"The Revolution Is at Hand," pro
posed that the next fight in Ohio
should be against poverty, and pledg
ed himself to head a social movement
looking toward the initiation of a
constitutional amendment to abolish
unemployment and poverty in tbe
state of Ohio, establish a living wage
as a minimum and create a Living
Wage Commission whose duty it shall
be to determine the living wage re- I
quired for each section of the state.
Rigelow explained, according to the
report in the Cincinnati Enquirer,
tjiat the living wage should be suffi
cient not only to afford a man with
a family adequate food and clothing,
but also adequate for the education
of bis children, the maintenance of a
cottage, and a garden, insurance and
such incidentals, including a little for
i amusements and church contributions.

Recognition of Union Labor
Is Guarantee of Good Faith
"Recognition of the union," after
all, implies merely a guarantee of
good faith on the part of the em
ployer toward his employes.
The importance of the demand for
"recognition of the union'" may be
very well judged by the amount of
opposition it encounters from the
etnploying class.
About the only argument (?) left
the non uit otilst Ih that of the fox
who had BBSS, his brush, town that
brushes are altogether too common.
There can not be any question of
the "sacredness of contract" with a
trade union whose actual existence
is assailed. The contract itself is
abrogated by the act of assault.
If consistency were a marketable
commodity the average employer
would probably keep in stock an en
tirely different brand of antiunion
argument (?).
*" The mnn who insists upon "run
ning his own business," would be
more consistent and more successful
•if he would recognize the line be
tween his business and the welfare
of the human race.
Labor can not make an Improve
ment In Rs own conditions without
breaking the friendship (?) of the
employer who has assumed the whole
right to attend to that sort of thing
—in his own good time.
The employer who is most strenu
ous In claiming the right to "run
-big own business" Is frequently most
insistent in the claim that It Is the
duty of his employes to attend to the
advertlstng end thereof.

Thomas Flynn, general organizer
of the American Federation of Labor,
issued a statement charging that the
rioting last week was a financial
scheme to depress the value of the
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company
stock so that merger of independent
steel interests can be effected.
Two federal investigations began.

it Is a mistake on the part of la

Better Have No Merchant Marine Than
Marine With No American Mariners
WASHINGTON. — A keen discus
sion of Ihe working of the American
Seamen's Law took place at the meet
ing of the American Association for
Labor Legislation.
The meeting, which was opened by
! Secretary of Labor Wm. 11. Wilson,
was addressed by Andrew Furuseth.
president of the International Sea
men's Union, Prof, Henry W. Farnam
of Yale, and Dr. Frederick L. Hoff
man, of the Prudential Insurance Co.
of America.
That the shortage l of American mer
chant marine was due to the decay of
American seamanship was claimed
by Andrew Furuseth.
"Sea power," he said, "is the sea
men, and the race or nation whose
citizens or subjects leave the sea
must lose its sea power. The ad
vice of the shipowners has always
been taken by congress. The sea

the result is that at the beginning
of the present war the United States
had very few ships in the foreign
trade. While men are leaving the

TEUTON R. R. MAN
' LONDON. —Albert Hailing, director
general of the Hamburg-American
line, and now, at the special request
of the Kaiser, in charge of the Ger
man railway system, contributes the
following:
"Christmas. 1015, found the peoples
of Europe still embroiled in the most
cruel and idiotic war the world has
ever seen, immersed in a hopeless
struggle and in the sorrowful work
of converting this beautiful old hem
isphere into a mass of ruins, for the
benefit of the world on the other side
of the ocean and to the joy of tin
yellow race.
"The men who will one day be
called upon to construct peace must
conceive- it thoir noblest duty not
only to banish war from our genera
tion, but also to wipe out the Euro
pean armaments fever for decades to
come.
"They will also have to seek guar
antees that an economic war does not
follow this bloody one."
UNIONISTS PICKET
UNFAIR CHURCH
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -Union men
picketed the Avenue Pres
byterian church and greeted worship
pers with variations of "This church
is unfair to union labor."
One of them on picket duty was
the ReV, \Y. S. Bundy. a Methodist
minister and representative ot a lo
cal carpenters' union, according to
the Rev. Geo. P. Bailey, pastor of
the Presbyterian church.
Several conferences with a con
tractor for a $20,000 social center
addition to the church to employ on
ly union carpenters having failed, the
picketing was ordered. The union
men held forth in front of the church
and across the street for twenty min
utes.
SHIPYARDS BUSY
The revival of shipbuilding in yards
>f the country is greater than It has
been for many years, according to
government reports. Orders have
been pouring in from domestic sour
ces and from Scandinavian countries
and Kngland, developing a field that
had not been touched before by Amer
ican shipbuilders for half a century.
The revival in the building dates
from one year ago. Since then con
tracts have been let for big freight
and tank ships to the number of 110.
These include ships of 7500 net tons
register or over. In 1914 there were
only 40 steamers built, 1911, 50 steam

THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE
DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST
EVERETT, WASH., FRIDAY, JANUARY 14, 1916.
(sea and thoir places nre taken by
mi n of African or Asiatic races. Men
wt'thout knowledge of the language of
the officers and without sufficient
practical experience to know how to
obey orders, are destructive of safety
and hence loss of life at sea lias
been increasing. For these reasons
the Seamen's Act provides for a ver
bal understanding of orders and a
technical ability to obey orders.
"If any element of safety to the pas
sengers and anything like an equal
opportunity for the Americans on the
sea is desired, the Seamen's Act will
have to be protected and properly
administered."
Prof. n. W. Farnam of Yale said
that the fact that the seamen's law
was opposed by important It •rests
was not in itself conclusive.
"We have seen over and over
again, in the history of labor legis
'ation, that measures which were
proved mathematically by thosi In
terested to be ruinous to business
have been found to be perfectly
fcasil.de.
WOODSMEN MUST ORGANIZE
DULUTHi Minn. —"A few we ks
ago a group of lumber barons met in
a room In a Dulutli hotel and after
discussing the labor situation in the
woods at some length, resolved to
agree together to reduce the wages
of the lumber jacks to $20 a month,"
says the Labor World of this city.
"But the lumber barons will do
nothing to improve the conditions of
the men employed in the wood- They
will not correct the wrongs they have
imposed on the men. They profit by
their Iniquitous system of exploitation
and occasional murmurs from discon
tented individual woodsmei. do not
give them any worry.
"If the woodsmen were organized,
however, as they should be. there
would be a different Storj to tell
about their lot in the woods. When
will they awaken? The lumber bar
ons reduced wages by meeting and
combining. The men can raise their
wages by and through the same meth
od. It is up to them."

UNEMPLOYMENT YET
EXISTS
ALBANY, N. V.—The claim of cer
tain newspapers and large employ
ers, who fear legislation intended to
restrict Immigration, that "there is
work for all," does not harmonize
with a report Issued by the depart
ment of labor, a section of the state
industrial commission. This report
shows that on Nov. 15 last 240 trade
unions in this state, with a member
ship of 154.206, reported a total idle
ness of 17.G per cent, against 12.7
per cent. Oct. 15, and 14.0 per cent.
Sept. 15.
It is stated that the membership
reported on Nov. 15, includes approxi
mately one-fourth of the organized
workers in the state, "chosen so as
to include for each trade and group
of trades as nearly as possible the
same proportion of the total organiz
ed workers in the state. The list is.
therefore, representative of organized
workers only."
While climatic conditions is un
doubtedly a factor in the 23.0 per
cent, of idleness in the build'ng in
dustry, the report shows that in the
manufacturing industries 10.3 per
cent were idle on November 15. 1015.
In this section the highest percentage
was found in glass and glassware,
with 27.7 per cent; clothing and tex
tiles followed with 24 per cent, idle
ness. while paper and paper goods
was lowest with 3.6 per cent, followed
by tobacco. 4.2 per cent., and machin

In transportation the total idleness
averaged S I per cent. Freight hand

NEW TRIAL ASKED
IRREGULARITIES ALLEGED
I.os Angeles. Calif. —
After three months' continuous trial
which cost the county of I.os Angeles
probably not less than $75,000 and
during which the old stereotyped story
of alleged dynamit incs by the stool
pigeons of the steel trust and their
dupes was rehearsed in detail, the
jury in the M. A. Schmidt case
brought In a verdict of guilty on
Thursday evening, December 80, aft
er a brief deliberation. A sentence
of life imprisonment was recommend-
Schmidt listened to the verdict with
the same calm and fearless demenno*
that has characterized h : m throughout
tbe trial and that has cone far to
wards convincing the spectators dur
ing the trial of his entire innocence
of the charges against him.
His devoted sister. {Catherine, who
has been constantly at h : s side dur
ing the trial, also bore up wonderfully
tinder the ordeal, her whole thoughts
evidently being for the brother whom
she carressed and to whom she spoke
words of cheer and loyalty.
Schmidt himself probably was the
most unconcerned man in tbe court
room. To say that his friends were
surprised at the verdict is to put it
very mildly. Indeed tbe verd'et has
been widely commented on. the gen
eral opinion among lawyers and oth
ers being that the evidence did not
warrant it and thai in any ev< nt the
punishment recommended was too
severe under the circumstances
