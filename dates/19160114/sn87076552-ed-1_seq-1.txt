COURT PROCEEDINGS
Diftmisaed Until March No State
Cae Left For Jury To Act On
Civil Case v Disposed Of New
Casea Filed Court of Appeals.
The Court, the Prosecuting At
torney. Clerk and Sheriffs all seem
to be in a conspiracy to expedite legal
procedure in Fulton county: First
the grand jury walks . through ten
cases in one day, next the petit jury
is permitted to get in just one day of
service, the bar docket is getting
thinner and thinner, the critics who
inveighed against the dilatory methods
of the court are out of a job and the
newspaper men are running short
on "copy.
The petit jury convened Monday
and tried one case, that of Baumgard-
ner & Company vs Lola F. Cramer:
money only; the verdict was for the
defendant, "no cause for action;"
there being no other cases for the jury
at this time they were dismissed un
til March. No State cases were
brought before the petit jury for the
reason that all seven cases had been
adjudicated by the court in such a
way that it was unnecessary to bring
them to jury trial. .

EASTER SEASON.
To everything there is a season
and a time to every purpose under
the heaven" EccL 3, 1. A favorable
season for calling men from sin to
righteousness, from the world and
worldiness to the church and godliness
is the pre-easter season. Especially
passion week. The custom is becom
ing quite prevalent among the
churches, generally ' to hold special
services a week or ten days at this
time of the year culminating with
faster. We wish to begin the beauti
ful and fitting custom in our city this
year. Several ot the churches are
planning on this and we believe that
they should be given the right of
way for the time being. Hence we
suggest to the citizens of-Wauseon
the fitness of refraining from all pub
lie suppers, parties, ball games and
social functions of all kinds for at
least a week or ten days preceeding
Easter. We believe that you will see
at once the reasonableness of our
recommendation and we wish to assure
you of our profoundest appreciation of
your co-operation in this matter.

About 400 people gathered last Fri
day evening to witness the Basket
Ball games between the Montpelier
High School team and that of the
Wauseon High, also the battle of the
West Unity Grades against the Wau
seon Grades. Wauseon boys were
victorious in both games much to the
delight of the Wauseon rooters who
were out in splendid array.
The teams from Montpelier and
West Unity were unaccompanied by
any of their home folks, but they
were tine fellows and played a clean
game.
The score was 43 to 11 in favor of
Wauseon in the Montpelier-Wauseon
game, and "the Wauseon Grade Boys
kept up the enthusiasm of the Wau
seon Rooters by putting it over the
West Unity Boys by, a good wide mar
gin. The Wauseon High School team is
composed of: Snyder, Captain, Grif
fin center, Harry Sweeny left for
ward, Farley right guard, Harold
Sweeny left guard; Harold Bayes,
Frank Ufer and Lloyd Abbs substitutes.
Not so very many moons ago the
above aggregation invaded the baili
wick of the Napoleon High School
team and were very efficiently beaten
by a score of 40 to 27 in favor of the
Napoleons who out class the Wauseon
warriors in size and in weight. But
the blood of the Wauseon warriors
is up since they attached the scalp
of Montpelier, (Figuratively speaking
of course,) to their girdle, and Fn
dav night, January 14th these same
Wauseon braves will meet the Napo
leons on their own camping ground
at Saunder's Hall and the result is
likely to be intensely interesting.
MRS. CORDELIA LYON.
The funeral services for Mrs. Cor
delia Lyon whose decease was chron
icled in these columns last week was
held at her late home on Clinton
street last Friday afternoon at two
o'clock conducted by Rev. C. N. Pond
D. 1)., of Oberhn, a former pastor and
a long time friend of Mr. and Mrs.
Lyon.
.the passing of Mrs. Lyon removes
from this community one of the old
est residents, one who was widely
known and very highly esteemed and
loved by those who knew her.
Mrs. Lyon was a member of th
Congregational church of Wauseon foi
nearly fifty years and her life during
all these years has been an exemplifi
cation of the faith which she professed.
Owing to the inclemency of the
weather the burial in Wauseon ceme
tery was, at the request of the family
private.
The following brief sketch of Mrs.
Lyon's life was read by Doctor Pond
at the service Friday afternoon:
Mrs. Cordelia Lyon, the subject of
this sketch was born December 23,
1829 in West Cunnington, Massachu
setts, and died in her home in Wau
seon January 5, 1916 aged eighty-ix
years and thirteen days. The deceas
ed was the daughter of Ebenezer and
Nancy Torrey Shaw and one of a
family of five children.
bhe was born on the farm adjoin
ing the birth place of William Cullen
Bryant and her father was for many
years a school mate and intimate
friend of the great poet.
In 1829 her father and mother de-
cided to cast their lot with their
eighbors and friends who had decid
ed to leave New England and Beek
their fortune in the then new West,
Among their friends was the Lyon
family with which she was to become
identified in later years. The journey
west was by wagon to Albany, New
York, thence by canal to Butfalo,
by lake boat to Cleveland from Cleve,
land to their future home at Chatham
Center, Ohio.
The little colony at once began the
work of leveling the forests and build-
ing their log cabins. For many years
their life was the sturdy Me of the
pioneer, full of hardships but boulid
together by ties of friendship that
never were broken. In 1849 the de
ceased was married to Marcus Lyon
and they lived in Chatham until 1855,
During this time two children were
born to them but both died in child
hood. In May 1855 they moved to
Wauseon and made their home at
Lena, at that time the new home of
many of their young Chatham friends,
They remained in Lena three years
and during htis time the deceased
taueht school until the chills and
fever, so prevalent m those days, un
lermmed the health of both herseit
and her husband and they returned to
the old home in Chatham where they
ived until 1866. on the old Shaw home'
stead. During the summer of 1866
they came again to Wauseon to make
their home and she lived here con
tinuouslv ud to the time of her death,
The deceased was the mother of six
children four of whom died in early
childhood. Two children survive her,
Arthur W. of Ligonier, Indiana and
Marv Sater of Columbus.
Mother Lyon became a Christian at
a very early age but did not unite
with the church until she was over
thirty years old. Since that time
she has been a devoted cnnstian ana
a most loyal adherent to her church
and its work. Since the ' death of
Father Lyon in 1902 she has lived
ilone in her home here and has never
'ost interest in her neighbors and
friends, children and grand children.
With sight and mental faculties un
impared by the ravage of time, her
last days have been filled with joy
happiness and an abiding taitn in ner
Master.
The influence of her life will be felt
for years to come, not only on the
'ives of neighbors and friends who
had learned to love her, but upon the
community in which she lived and was
for so many years a part. The last
prayer uttered by her lips was tne
praver taught her at her mothers knee
in childhood. "Now, I lay me down to
To live such a life is not to have
lived in vain we reioice that ere this
she has heard the "Well done good and
faithful servant."

making the percentage of attendance
for the time 99.62. Tis grade has an
