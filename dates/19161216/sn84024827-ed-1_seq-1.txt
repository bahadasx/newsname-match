(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15. Any sug
gestion of an agreement between the J
American government and Villa is re
garded by administration officials as
unworthy of consideration. No official
report f Villa's alleged proposal that
an agreement with him would result
in the cessation In the killing of
Americans and orders to stop the de
struction of American property had
reached the state department tonight
and some doubt was expressed that he
had made such overtures.
Absurd Request.
EL PASO, Dec. 15. A Mexican
reached the border today from Villa's
camp at Creel, fifty miles west of
Minaca in the Guerrero district of
Chihuahua with proposals for the
United States government that Villa
would refrain from further destruction j

This was officially announced late
today by a high representative of the
government here after Villa's proposal
bad been forwarded to Washington by
telegraph. Villa even offers to pro
tect all foreigners and their property
from the raids of irresponsible bandits.
it was also stated. This proposal in-j

Villa Has 8,000 Men.
At the camp where Villa had left
his wounded in the Guerrero district,
believed to be Guerrero town, a num
ber of Carranza wounded were also
being treated by Villa's surgeons after
they bad promised to join the Villa
army, the Mexican's report to govern
ment agents stated. Villa had eight
thousand well armed men and three
thousand rifles in reserve, the Mexican
courier reported, and also a number
of artillery pieces with him and a
supply of shells for these pieces.
Needs U. S. Now.
From sources here known to be
friendly to Villa it was learned today
that Villa was anxious to put himself
in a better light with the United
States and this was said to account
for the fact that no Americans or
other foreigners other than Chinese
and Arabs, were killed In Chihuahua
City during the Ave days Villa was in
command.
The local Villa partisans say Villa
had plenty of time in which to hunt
down and kill all the Americans in
Chihuahua City had he wished. Villa,
his friends here say, has realized that
he could never win his campaign
against Carranza with the United
States opposing him actively and they
say he is willing to give guarantees
to Americans and 'other foreigners in
the zone of his operations if he is
permitted to continue his campaign
against the de facto government un
molested. The Villa partisans say
Howard Gray was killed at Parral be
cause he bad taken an active part in
the political affair around Parral and
had even organized a small military
force there, they claim.
General Luis Herrera has returned
frosi,Tepehuanes, Durango, fj the Par
ral district of Chihuahua, according to
information received by the Alvarado
Mining and Milling company today.
General Herrera left Parral on Novem
ber 2 when Villa started his advance
from Jimenez to that mining camp.

Reports received here by military
authorities today from western Chihua

Jimenez after which he would recap

HUNT STILL GAINS;
IS 16 VOTES BEHIND.
PHOENIX. Dec. 15. A half
dozen more precincts were gone
over today by the inspectors in
the contest of Governor Hunt
against Thos. E. Campbell. The
only developments were a gain of
three for Hunt in one precinct
and the laying aside of a large
number of ballots for determina
tion by the court. This, with
previous gains lOr Hunt, reduces
Campbell's majority in the state
to sixteen. The returns from the
missing Wilgus precinct of Co
chise county in which there is a
majority of nine for Campbell,
have been discovered but whether
they will be taken into account at
this state is uncertain. That will
be one of the matters that will
be determined in the supreme

WASHINGTON, Dec. 15. Legisla

The House postoffice committee re

to close the mails absolutely to ad

and to deny mail order houses the
right to go into either "wet" or "dry"

No move was made by prohibition

Amendment Doubtful
House members are reflecting on
the prospects for its passage and the
concensus of opinion seems to be that
it cannot get the necessary two thirds j
majority in the sixty fourth congress,
Representative Webb Is confident that
the amendment will receive more
votes than it did in the last congress,
when it had 13 more than a majority.
Ey the time the next congress has
considered the issue he believes the
battle can be ou.
The District of Columbia prohibi

signified that they would be ready for

NEW YORK. Dec. 15. Elihu Hoot

a mass meeting here called to protest
against the deportation of thousands
of male Belgians into Germany
where they are compelled to labor.
"I should not respect myself if I re

country will not remain silent.

Without Any Mediation

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15. An
authorized statement of the Ger
man embatsy issued hers that
partial disarmament would be one
of the subjects taken up at any
peace conference is being discuss
ed generally in official and diplo
matic circles, with speculation as
to how far in this Germany might
be willing to go.
Definite indication of the atti
tude of the entente allies is ex
pected in the speech of David
Lloyd-George, the British premier,
next Tuesday.
No Offer of His Own
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15 President
Wilson has decided that the notes of
the central powers proposing a dis
cussion of peace to the entente allies
will be sent forward by the American
government acting ss Intermediary
without and accompanying mediation
offer of its own. He has not deter
mined whether any action in behalf
of peace will be taken later by the
United Stat-s on its own account, but
is holding himself in readiness to
serve in any way possible toward
bringing the warring nations together.
Notes Vary
The course to be pursued was madt
"nown tonight after the President had
conferred with Secretary Lansing, and
after a prolonged cabinet meeting. It
was stated that the delay in forward
ing the notes to the entente capitals
was due to the fact that the messages
received from Gern.any. Austria-Hungary
nnd Turkey, identical in sub
stance, differed slightly in phraseolo
gy as a result of different transla
tions. They probably will be put on
the cables tomorrow.
Studying Notes
Since the first note arrived, the one
from Germany, the President and his
closest advisors havo been absorbed
in study of the situation created. The
Austrian note followed, and the one
from Turkey came late today, too late
to be translated for the cabinet meet
ing. Those from Germany and Aus
tria have been gone over carefully
by the President and Secretary Lan
sing, to make certain of their mean
ing, and so that they may be sure to
properly represent the intent of the
central powers.
The fact that the cabinet meeting
today lasted more than three hours
and was the most prolonged of the
year, attracted profound attention in
official quarters end led to all sorts
of speculation. It was explained lat
er, however, that the meeting was de
voted largely to consideration of de
partmental matters, and had been
prolonged because it was the first
time since the campaign that all the
members had been present.
Await Allies View
In other quarters than the White
House it was learned that some word
indicating the official attitude of the
entente allies toward the peace pro
posals is being awaited with the deep
est interest by the American govern
ment. The President will not consid
er injecting the United States into the
situation until he is thoroughly famil
iar with all its phases.
Translations Differ
Secretary Lansing, explaining the
delay in transmitting the communica
tions to the entente powers, said the
German note was translated into Eng
lish by Charge Grew at Berlin and the
one from Austria by Ambassador Pen
field at Vienna, while the Turkish
note came to the state department in
French. As the communications were
intended to he identical, the state de
partment does not desire to transmit
tree different versions and when all
