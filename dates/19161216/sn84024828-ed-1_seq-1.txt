(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
LONDON, Dec 15 The allies re
quire that there shall be adequate
reparation for the past and adequate
security for the future. That is still
the policy and still the determination
of the British government.
This was the declaration of Andrew
Bonar Law, repeating the words of
Mr. Asquith three months ago, as he
made his debut today as the leader of
the new government in the house of
commons.
It was only a brief and passing al
lusion to the German peace proposal,
but the ringing announcement that it
was still the policy and determination
of the government struck the keynote
of the new government's attitude and
aroused a prolonged demonstration of
approval.
The sessions of both the lords and
commons were attended with unusual
interest as being the first bow of the
new government, though the absence
of Premier Lloyd-George through con
tinned illness left the initial scene of
the new regime like Hamlet without
the Dane. Great crowds besieged
Westminister for admission and both
chambers showed the galleries filled
with eager hearers and the floors
animated with newly formed political
groups.
The commons was the scene of chief
interest as here five ministers of the
late government Reginald McKenna,
Walter Runciman, Herbert Samuel,
Lewis Harcourt and H. J. Tennant
ranged themselves on the front bench
of the opposition, while Andrew Bonar
Law, flanked by the ministers of the
new administration, occupied, the
bench just vacated by the Asquith
ministers across the aisle:
Mr. Asquith, like Mr. Lloyd-George
was absent through sickness, but even
with the chief figures absent, it was
a striking scene of the old and the
new regimes facing each other at the
crucial moment of the issues over war
and peace.
The feature" of the day was Bonar
Law's presentation of the bill for $2,-
000,000,000 additional war credits and
bis incidental reference to the peace
proposal. In urging the war credit,
Bonar Law displayed his command of
the vast financial branch and his ease
and readiness as a parliamentary
leader.
Referring to the vast daily expen
ditures of 5,700,000 pounds as "co
lossal beyond imagination," he frankly
declared that such figures could not
be continued indefinitely; all that
could be hoped for was to continue
them long enough to beat the enemy.
Bonar Law's reference to the Ger
man proposal came as he closed. He
prefaced it with the statement that
the proposal had not yet reached his
majesty's government and that it was
obvious that no members of the gov
ernment could make a statement, and
that in his view it were better that
little should be said in the house of
commons. Then came his renewal of
Mr. Asquith's declaration for adequate
preparation and security as still the
policy of the government which was
the one thing he felt it necessary to
refer to at this stage.
Mr. McKenna's reply from the op
position bench, besides complimenting
Mr. Bonar Law, referred to the com
manding influence of the American
dollar as the result of the war.
"It is not easy to convert sterling
wealth into dollars wealth," he said.
"We must pay in dollars for what we
buy now, not only in America but all
over the world."
The debate was brief and the war
credit was passed by unanimous vote.
Some speeches referred to the German
proposal but there was no discordant
note.
Mr. Bonar Law announced that par
liament would be prorogued on De
cember 22 for a period not yet determined.
SLACKERS ORDERED
TO REPORT ON LINE
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., Dec
14. Orders for 135 members of
the Oklahoma national guard to
report for duty immediately or be
prosecuted as deserters were re
ceived today by Adjutant General
Earp from Colonel R. A. Brown
at Fort-Sam Houston, Texas.
EJMTTF
GEM MILL RUNNING
The Golden Gem mill is pounding
away on ore from the Gem mine, un
der the management of A. W. Clapp.
The mill is reported to be doing good
work, the gold bullion being very fine.
Mr. Clapp has been in charge of the
wrk on the Gem for two years and
now apparently has it in producing
shape.
TUNNEL ORE
From Thnraday'a Daily Miner!
The adit drift of the Arizona Butte
Mines company on the Banner vein is
being driven ahead in ore. The breast
of the drift, when the property was
taken over by the company, was in a
lean streak, but a few feet of work
has brought it into splendid ore. The
ore had been penetrated 22 feet TueS'
day night and was being driven ahead
at a good rate of speed. Five feet
of ore shows in the drift that is better
than .50 per cent metaL This find is
about 2200 feet from the portal and
at a point that heretofore .had not
been considered as an ore bearer.
The big bore being driven from the
valley level into -the Prince George
vein is now in 450 feet It is being
carried along the hanging wall and is
expected to reach the ore bearing part
of the vein within the next 200 or 300
feet. This tunnel is expected to prove
up one of the greatest mining propo
sitions in the county.
KHAN BALLOTS
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
The commission of investigation,
preparatory to a contest for the
sheriff's office, yesterday completed the
spection of the ballots cast in King
man precinct About 27 ballots were
set aside for the inspection of the
court Chloride and a number of
smaller precincts were vised, but only
a few irregularities were found. So
far only 40 ballots will be placed be
fore the court for his inspection and
decision. As few of the ballots have
been marked so that the commission
could ascertain whether they had been
counted or rejected by the election
board nothing could be ascertained as
to the standing of the candidates.
Today the commission will take up
Oatman and tomorrow it is expected
that a complete inspection of all the
ballots will have been made. The de
fense will object to the counting of
the votes in several precincts, Gold
road, Cyclopic, Cedar and Music
Mountain being among .the objection
able precincts.
One of the peculiar things noted in
the matter the contest is that should
the plaintiff find from the inspection
of the ballots that he may not gain
enough votes to elect, he may dismiss,
in which event the status of the con
test will be as though no action had
been commenced, leaving the vote a
tie. The fact that the board of sup
ervisors reconsidered its action after
the original count was made does not
alter the situation, as the board lack
ed authority to sit again as a can
vassing board and declare a new re
suHjf wherefore, the original declara
tion of a tie vote will stand. This is
mentioning unadvisedly, as a peculiar
ity of the law governing recounts in
Arizona. The present action is but
a "fishing" trip, preparatory to a re
count and cannot be considered otherwise.'
MUSIC MOUNTAIN MINES
ARE SHOWING UP WELL
T. D. Walsh, who is in charge of
the Nevada Arizona Mines properties,
at Music mountain, is in Kingman.
He reports that everything at ,the
mines is moving along satisfactorily
and that it is possible that a larger
milling plant will soon be in operation.
The work being carried on below the
Roosevelt tunnel has opened up some
exceptionally good bodies of gold ore.
TELLS OF CONVENTION OF
DEALERS AT OVERLAND PLANT
From Tuesday! Daily Miner
J. E. Perry, Willys-Overland dealer
in Kingman, who was one of the 5,000
dealers who visited the great Toledo
plant in connection with the immense
convention recently held, recounts his
experiences in the following letter
written while at the factory to the
editor of the Mohave Daily Miner.
Some action! Nothing was ever so
impressive as our tour of the great
plant that turns out Willys-Overland
cars. Our Pullmans all parked in the
company yards. There was room
enough, for there are seven and
three-quarter miles of track within the
plant Each man got a card contain
ing a picture of Mr. Willys and an
autographed message of welcome from
him. Next thing I knew we were
lined up on the steps of the stunning
w administration building getting
.photographed. Elevators shot us to
the company's own restaurant on the
sixth floor. There we had a corking
breakfast At each plate was a copy
of the live new Willys-Overland house
organ "The Starter". It mapped our
day's program.
Then started our tour of the plant
Our guides were carefully picked men.'
They knew the plant from end to end,
and the parties were small so that
each member of the party could have
his questions answered. Nobody ought
to try to sell Willys-Overland product
without knowing this plant You
can't grip the immensity of the prop
osition till you do. It is no piker
business. $25,000,000 are tied up in
land, buildings and machinery, not to
say a word about the stock of parts
and raw material.
From the roof of the wonderful ad
ministration building, which stands
out like a state capitol, you get a
great panorama of the plant You
can then readily believe that it oc
cupies 103 acres, with 4,486,680 square
feet of floor space in 'daily use and a
production capacity of 1000 cars per
day. You can appreciate the growth
from 350 employes in 1908 to 17,300
in 1916. 1,000 persons, more than the
entire manufacturing force of many
a company, work in the administration
building alone. This structure, 375
feet long, has every facility for rapid
work, including dictaphones, its own
telegraph and telephone system and a
mail handling department that does
about everything but write the letters,
388 persons can be fed in the restau
rant at one time.
But this is nothing to what hits
when you cross into the shops. It is
a whirl of action, yet all is system,
rarts 01 tne untold thousands are
here, with a value into the millions
of dollars. There are lines of motors,
I never saw so many crank shafts
together. Our guide said 6,000 I'd
have believed 60,000. There is stock
in bins, stock in yards, stock along
the walls, connection rods, frames,
fenders, mudguards, hoods, rims,
springs, axles, torsion tubes, trans
mission gear shales, DraKe parts
teering rods, pedals it is an unending
procession.
Every thirty days sees an average
of 1000 tons of steel come in. It is
bandied by a magnetic crane that
enables two men to do a work that
formerly reauired thirty. There are
amazing machines. The toggle press.
for example, held us all. This mon
ster, with its pressure of 1000 tons,
shapes cold steel like cardboard.
piece of metal fed to it comes out as
a side frame. It can make 2000 of
these in an eight hour day. Other
mighty machines stamp out radiator
shells, fenders, cowl dashes and doors,
You take off your hat to the drop forg
ing machines. Down comes the ham
mer and the fiery piece of iron is
beaten into shape. The complete drop
forging of the front axle can be ac
complished with one heat Every
kind of part requiring strength was

crank shafts, brake assembly rods,
brake and control rods, spring shack

The multiple spindle drill in one
operation drills all the holes in the
front axle. This is a guarantee that
each will be in right relation to the
other. It was hard to drag us away
from the automatic turret lathe that
surfaces and finishes fly wheels. It
works as though somewhere within
its metal vitals a brain was concealed.
The workman has only to put on the
fly wheel, adjust the first set of tools,
push the lever, and let the machine
do the rest. The cast iron is peeled
off as readily as wax. Sometimes four
or five operations are performed at
once. When one set of cuttings is

0. S. WITNESS
QUESTIONED BY
E
P
(From Friday's Daily Miner.)
SAN FRANFISCO, Cal., Dec 14.
Louis J. Smith, government's chief
witness, stuck to his testimony today
the fact of persistent cross-
examination by the defense in the trial
of Franz Bopp, German consul-general
in San Francisco, and six others for
alleged conspiracy to violate United
States neutrality by blowing up muni
tions ships intended for the entente
allies.
Smith, one of the seven under indict
ment, was forced by Theodore Roche
the counsel for the defense, to admit
that he had been promised immunity
from punishment in return for his
testimony at this trial. He also ad
mitted that following the alleged re
ceipt of $1254.80 from the German
consulate funds here in July, 1915, he
had journeyed from San Francisco to
Oshkosh, Wis., accompanied by a
woman not his wife. The court, how
ever, sustained objections preventing
the defense from further questioning
Smith concerning the latter incident
Efforts to prove Smith a deserter
from the 1st Maryland volunteers,
with whom he enlisted at the outbreak
of the Spanish war, failed. Through
out the day Roche attempted unsuc
cessfully to draw from Smith an ad
mission that tne Bntisn consular
offices here and in Detroit, Mich., had
befriended him in return f pr his tes
timony against Bopp, Vice Consul E.
H. von Schack, Lieut G. W. von
Brincken, the alleged go-between, C. C.
Crowley, and Crowley's assistant, Mrs. j
Margaret W. Cornell.
CAMPBELLS
MAJORITY IS
DWINDLING
(From Friday's Daily Miner.)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec 14. Twenty
six hundred ballots out of about 15,000
of Maricopa county have been inspect
ed in the contest for governor at the
end of the third day. No changes of
importance were discovered, though
my of the ballots were laid aside
fr the character of them to be de
termined in court
The net changes so far have been
11 in favor of Governor Hunt, errors
having been discovered in the making
of additions in two precincts. These
changes reduce the majority of Camp
bell to 19.
' Lost Sack Found
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Dec- 14. The
sack containing 19 ballots cast in
Willgus precinct in Cochise county, at
the November election, thought to
have been lost and not officially count
ed, was discovered today in the office
of the county treasurer at Tombstone.
It was explained that the sack had
become mixed with others which had
been checked, when the county chair
man was at work and had been stored
with the others in accordance with the
state law. But for the contest on ,the
governorship the sack would not have
been discovered for a long time at
least
It will be taken, with seal intact, as
when received from the election board
to Phoenix Friday by County Treasur
er H. S. Ross. The unofficial returns
from this were Campbell, Republican
14; Hunt, Democrat, 5,
DANES FAVOR SALE
TO U.S. OF W. INDD3S
COPENHAGEN, Dec 15 (via
London). The plebescite held
yesterday on the question of the
sale of the Danish West Indies
to the United States resulted in
283,000 votes cast in favor of the
sale and 157,000 against such action.
U. S. DIVER
LATEST STRIKE AT
Ray C. Dimmick yesterday brought
in a big sample of ore from the Middle
Golconda that is really one of the fin
est specimens of zinc the writer has
seen in the county. The ore is solid
spahlerite, there being not one par
ticle of gangue in ij. Mr. Dimmick
told the Daily Miner reported that
seven feet of this ore had been cut
and that the crosscut still had 150 feet
to go to penetrate the titanic vein.
Charles B. Bell, who has managed
the Middle Golconda since it was
taken over from the Mulligan in
terests, was in Kingman yesterday
evening and verified the report of Mr.
Dimmick. Mr. Bell expects to begin
drifting on the big zinc streak within
the next week, it being the intention
to" drive toward the Golconda ground,
where gfeater depth can be gained.
The lower tunnel will get" under the
ore outcrop at the south end of the
company's ground, at a depth of 600
feet, which will give big backs of
stoping ground.
TO END EXISTENCE
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
A woman of Chloride's underworld.
known as "Teddy" held in the county
jail here on a charge of bootlegging,
yesterday attempted suicide by the
poison route. She was unsuccessful,
however and was last night out of
danger. With another woman, she
was brought in from the lead camp
by a couple of detectives some days
ago and it is thought that despondency
caused her to attempt her life.

DEVELOPING PROPERTY
J. S. Harrison, who owns promising
mining property in the Thumb Butte
section of Union Pass, as well as other
parts of that district, is a Kingman
visitor. He has been opening up an ore
body in his Thumb Butte property and
now has a splendid gold showing. The
ore carries an average value of above
70 per ton, while there are small
streaks that wijl run as high as $500
per ton.
A R Pil Y IS PAYING OUT
$75,000 EACH OAYTO
SOLDIERS' FAMILIES
From Friday's Dally Miner!
WASHINGTON, Dec 14. The war
department is paying out $75,000 a
day to the dependent families of en
listed men of .the regular army and
national guard, according to General
Sharp, quartermaster-general, in in
formation given the house military
committee today.
The $2,000,000 fund for this purpose
already provided is virtually exhaust
ed, he added, and emergency legisla
tion will be asked to continue the pay
ments through the present month. If
disbursements continue at the present
rate a deficiency of nearly $5,000,000
will be shown by the end of the fiscal
year.
General Sharp said the law limited
payments to the mothers, wives and
children of soldiers and that in many
pathetic cases where aid had been
asked for fathers or sisters the appli
cation could not be considered.
ES
SAND SPIT
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
EUREKA, Cal., Dec 14. Her two
officers and 25 man crew safe ashore
after eight hours of battering in liter
breaker tossed hull, the United States
submarine H3 pounded uneasily to
night 125 yards offshore, two miles
north of the Eureka harbor entrance.
Her commander, Lieut S. R. Bogusch,
last to step into the breeches buty
which had carried his men ashore be
for him, closed her conning tower
hatch tight, and said his vessel was
practically water free and probably
capable of salvage. This will be at
tempted as soon as a navy tug can tra
verse the 214 miles from San Fran
cisco, one having been ordered tonight
by radio to leave Mare island navy
yard at once.
All of the 27 had suffered bruises
in the pounding which accompanied
their surf forced progress up the
beach. At 10 o'clock this morning the
H3 was more than 300 yards offshore1
when she nosed into the sand, a heavy
fog concealing the land from her
navigator. When darkness closed down
tonight, the diver had traversed 176
yards under pressure of the mounting
as.
This progress probably, which, was
aided, Lieut Bogusch said tonight by
emptying the diver's tanks, was the
greatest factor in saving the lives of
her crew, however, as her decks were
too wave swept at the greater depth
to permit her crew to crawl out lomj
enough to haul aboard a buoy line
shot aboard by coast guardsmen from
the Eureka station. Pulling out in
their cutter, the coast guardsmen
finally made fast a line and the last
man splashed to safety through the
surf at 6 o'clock." Except for the
bruises and slight suffering from
chlorine gas arising from a leaking
storage battery, the 27 escaped in
jury. Thousands of residents of this city
and surrounding towns witnessed the
rescue. The coast guard crew and
volunteers were aided by men of the
U. S. S. Cheyenne, the mother ship
under whose convoy the HI, H2 and
H3 were proceeding from Puget Sound
to winter quarters at San Diego. The
Cheyenne, unable to aid from the
water side, came into the harbor with

KEITH BUYS PAIGE
Arizona Engineering company sold
and delivered a Paige 38 yesterday to
Wallace Keith, secretary of the United
Eastern Mining company of Oatman.
From Wednesday's Dally Miner
Contractors at the Missouri-Mohave
property at Cerbat have struck a fine
body of ore in the shaft Samples
brought into Kingman yesterday by
Pete Vukoye indicated big values in
a three foot vein. The property lies
west of' the old Flores, one of the
early producers of the county.
In the early days the property was
owned by the proprietor of the Daily
Miner and some rich ore was taken
from it It was secured by J. W. Mor
gan and J. C. Lane, who disposed of
it to George W. Mark for himself and
St Louis associates. A company was
organized and the property will now
be explored at a depth of 300 feet
ORE BODY IS FOUND
From Thnrsdar'a Daily Miner
Peter Caffery was a visitor in King
man from Layne Springs the last few
days and reported that he had opened
up a fine body of ore in a winze from
an adit drift The ore shows well in
copper. The vein is one of the best
in that section and it seems probable
that Mr. Caffery will bring it out a
winner.
