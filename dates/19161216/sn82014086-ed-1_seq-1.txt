DANGER OF GOING TO PIECES
Barnegat Coast Guard Called to the
Assistance of Men on Board.
New York, Dec. 16. The United
States transport Sumner, which went
aground off Barnegat. N. J.,' in a fog
Monday night and which has resisted
all efforts of tugs to draw her off the
sand, was believed early this morning
to be in danger of going to pieces.
Vessels which had gone to her resist
ance have been asked to stand by to
take off the members of the crew who
have remained on beard. ,-. :
A call also was sent to the Barnegat
feeast guard crew to xtmieto the as
sistance of the men on board.
The transport 'began leaking badly
early in the evening and the engine
room was flooded before midnight. At
that hour the Sumner began to settle
deeply into the1 sand and it was be
lieved there was slight probability the
vessel would be saved.
Sixty-one members of the crew of
the Sumner were brought to this city
yesterday on board the transport Kil
patrick which had stood by for many
hours to lend its aid to the tugs which
were attempting to drag the stranded
steamer into deep water.
The ship's wireless could not be
heard after 12.30 and apparently had
been flooded. It had been gradually
growing weaker for some time and the
last words caught were: "Were:
"We are launching po "
The last word was not finished but
it was supposed to mean power boat..
Boats from the coast guard cutter
Seneca and others manned by the
Barnegat coast guards were on their
way to the Sumner's side a few min
utes later.

stated as a condition precedent to
peace. Do not, I pray you, by refusinn
an exchange of views, assume respon
sibility for a continuation of the' un
speakable horrors of this unparalleled
conflict. Your decision may mean life
or death to millions."

BUSINESS DOMINANCE
It has been said that dominance in business means no monopoly,
but leadership. It does not necessarily mean control of the market
but substantial and healthy volume built on sound principles and sup
ported by public recognition. Dominance .may be obtained by a long
and costly struggle, by a combination of several houses ..but many
have reached it in a far less expensive manner.
This new method is free from many of the obstacles incident to
the old ideas. This method is the employment of publicity that is
both expansive and intensive. Such publicity .brings, not only vol
ume of sales; which is the primary purpose, but stability which means
familiarity of the public with the firm's goods and therefore an assur
ance that present trade will be held other gained.
This is what advertising has done and what it is Constantly doing.
By using the 'best medium, such as The Bulletin is in this field, be
cause of its wide and thorough circulation, and by using it steadily
and judiciously, business development is assured. Try it and be con
vinced. The Bulletin carried the following matter during the past week:

against the Carranza government.
This was officially announced late
today by a high representative of the
government here after Villa's propos
al had been forwarded to Washing
ton by telegraph.
Offers to Protect Foreigners.
Villa also offered to protect all for
eigners and their property from the
raids of irresponsible bandits, it was
palso stated. The proposal included
all Americans in Mexico, it was add
ed. Has 8,000 Well Armed Men.
At the camp where Villa had left his
wounded in the Guerrero district, a
number of Carranza wounded were al
so being treated by Villa's surgeons
after they had promised to join the
Villa army, the Mexican's report to
government agents stated. Villa had
8,000 well armed men and 3,000 rifles
in reserve, the courier repsrted, and
also a numberof artillery pieces with
him and a supply of shells for these
pieces.
Anxious to Put Himself in Better
Light.
From sources here known to be
friendly to Villa it was learned today
that Villa was anxious to put himself
in a better light with the United
States government and this was said to
account for the fact that no Ameri
cans on other foreigners other than
Chinese and Arabs were killed in Chi
huahua City during the five days Villa
was in control.

weakness and reports that leasing neu
trals, especially the United States,
were giving indications of readiness to
assist in a stoppage of the war tended
materially to keep the wheat market
headed most of the time for lower and
lower levels.
Estimates from Washington that the
1916 yield of wheat in the United
States was 32,000,000 bushels more
than was generally supposed did a
good deal to discourage -bulls still fur
ther in the latter part of the session.

PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION
OF PAPER IBPRACTICABLE
Is Claim of Publishers of the Countrys
Larger Dailies.
Washington. Dec. 15. Publishers of
the country's largest dailies, it was in
dicated after a day of conferences
here i today, will oppose as impractical
ble a proposal that the federal trade
commission undertake supervision of
the distribution of American and Canadian-made
news print paper avail
able in the United States. A publish
er's committee will meet committees of
manufacturers and jobbers and the
federal rtade commission torommor to
consif-r an apportionment plan, sug
gested by the manufacturers. '
Distribution under the federal trade
eommissin, some of the publishers of
big newspapers insisted today, not
only would be illegal, but would not
solve the two most important problems
facing newspaper owners high prices
and an alleged shortage of paper.
