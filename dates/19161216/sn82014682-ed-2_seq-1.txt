QOTIuJS RIGHT
OF GRID JURORS
In Just what respect the territorial
grand Jury has authority to make rec
ommendations to county or other bod
t ies is a question that Attorney Lorrin
Andrews, chairman of the civil service
commission, would like to have an
swered." '
Andrews contends that the Jury had
no' authority to recommend that the
commission reinstate Jesse Gray as
police officer at Wahlawa; which, by
the way, the. commission has already
refused to do.
"The grand Jury, not being consti
tuted a court of appeals to view the
decisions of the commission, I do not
see how the commission could take
its recommendations into considera
tion," the chairman declares.
Andrews says he has had an ex
change of "notes" with Raymond C.
Brown, secretary of the grand Jury,
regarding the recommendations, and
the commission's actions on them.
"In my opinion the Jury has no
right to mix up In the affairs of any
other public bodies, Andrews adds.

murder, Murata Tokubeye, Japanese,
with the approval of the city attor

lingworth and Criminologist Harry
Ijke of the city attorney's office.

CHANGES IN TAX
ON INHERITANCES
Charles H. Merriam Recom
mends Graduated System
for Consideration
Members cf the territorial tax com
mission will probably take up for de
cision at the session to be held some
night next week the question of
whether or not to recommend , to the
legislature- a proposed change (in the
Inheritance law submitted by Charles
H. Merriam, secretarj'.
Mr. Merriam expressed the belief
today In discussing the proposal that
it will be more equitable and just by
far than the present system, and will
also follow in general the majority
of the. mainland states as well as the
British government.
The secretary proposes In his re
port to the commission a graduated
system of taxing heirs instead of the
hat rate now provided by law. This
rate is at present 2 per cent for all
inheritance money above $5000 receiv
ed by near relatives and for others 5
per cent above $500.
Under the new plan near relatives
would pay at the following rate: $5W0
to $10,000 at 1 per cent; $10,000 to $20.
000 at 2 per cent; $20,000 to $50,000
at 3 per cent; $50,000 to $75,000 at 5
per cent; $75,000 to $100,000 at 7 1-2
per cent, and above $250,000' at 10
per cent.
For distant relatives and friends the
rates would be: 3 per cent for $500 to
$5000 ; 5 per cent from $5000 to $20,
000; 10 per cent from $20,000 to $50,
000; 20 per cent from $50,000 to $10,
000, and 30 per cent for $100,000 or
more. ;";
Aliens come under a speciaKclass
whereby the rate of tax shalbe 25
per cent of the market value of inher
ited property above $500.

Chamber of Commerce Com

cation of Citizens
To make a tu3': cf the vice condi
tions of Honolulu so that the data col
lected can be clearly and lucidly pre
sented to the people of Honolulu at a
future mass meeting; 10 inaugurate a
campaign .of education in order . that
the people will know what is taking
place in the underworld; and to favor
the passage of "an abatement by in
junction" act by the legislature, is
the campaign outlmed today at a meet
ing of a special committee of the
Chamber of Commerce. The commit
tee is composed of Judge W. L. Stan
ley, chairman; W4 R. Farrington. Rob
ert Horner, Judge S. B. Dole, James
A. Rath and F. p. Atherton. With
these end 8 in view a committee com
posed of Farringtan, Rath, Horner and
Raymond C. Brown .was formed to
adopt a policy and to formulate a
concrete plan with which to go before
the public at such a meeting.
Education Deemed Essential
That if vice is stamped out cf Ho
nolulu the people mult be educated,
was the opinion . of the committee,
and to accomplish this a widespread
publicity campaign was approved in
conjunction with the mass meetings
that are. planned. . It was pointed
out that the vice wave, which is
spreading out over the city, is having
demoralizing effects among the
younger population who are begin
ning to think that there is nothing
immoral about their conduct "The
only way which it can be curbed,"
said Mr. Atherton, is to show them
that such action will - be frowned
.upon." ' . ' j . ' - - ' . - .'' ,
Police Headquarters Blamed ,;
The question' of the best means of
reducing the evil ;was next taken up.
Judge Dole said the trouble; so far
as the police went, was entirely due
to the rottenness pfj . headquarters.
which'Tias cxwriliSaaHy,. discouraged
the men below from upholding the
law,, and the other members concurred.
The abatement act' was suggested and
it was the opinion of the members
that it should be passed by the legis
lature, and other methods talked over.
Mr. Brown said that some of the
Iwilei women had scattered over the
city and gave an incident of a com
plaint which came to him from a man
who said that the,. house next to. his
was being nsed for immoral purposes.
Must Be Popular' Demand
Mr. Farrington sounded the key
note of the meeting when he said,
"The people do not know what is
going on, and before we can do any
thing to change the condition, they
must be educated. We cannot depend
upon the police department, for the
beads are spineless. The people them
selves must demand that the city be
cleaned up. v

"We are hoping to hear from more
agents of the different islands," said

"In fact my idea in issuing the tenta

form so that we may have their rec

"Japanese 01 Maul are sending their

Japanese there do aot want to place

FLOUR 60 CENTS
BARREL CHEAPER
THAN NOVEMBER
Wholesale Price Here Today
Is $9; Was $9.60 Only
Thirty Days Ago
Fears cf Honolulu housewives that
they might have to pay $11 or $12 a
barrel for flour before January 1 need
not be entertained, at least for the
present, because wholesale flour prices
in Honolulu have dropped 60 cents a
barrel in the last few weeks, accord
ing to one of the leading wholesalers
today.- '-
Present wholesale rrices for stand
ard grades of flour in this city are now
$9 a barrel, against $9.60 a barrel at
this time last month, and some whole
salers are selling good grades to gro
cers today at $8.73 a barrel wholesale.
There are plenty of stocks on hand
and no shortage is looked for In the
near future.
One reason for higher flour prices
this year is furnished in the fact that
for the fiscal year which closed June
30, 1916, exporis of flour from the
United States to foreign countries
reached a value of $S7,347,805, against
$34,454,173 for the year ending June
30, 1914, before the European war be
gan. ' ;
Wheat expori3 for the year ending
June '30, 19 1G, totalled the huge sum
of $213,532,681, more than double the
exports of this commodity for the fis
cal year ending June 30, 1914, when
exports of wheat were only $87,933,436.

Two Explosions Burst Simul

Flames in Iron Works Dyna
mited By McNamara Gang
(Asaociated Trss a Faderil Wiirleas)
LOS ANGELES, CaL, Dec 15. A
mysterious and disastrous firs which
ths city authorities believe was in
cendiary early today destroyed most
of the big Llewellyn Iron Works plant
in this city. '
Two heavy explosions occurred in
the plant simultaneously with the dis
covery of the fire, which attained
headway with such rapidity that it
could not be checked until It had
burned over two squares.
The damace is estimated at $350,000.
The police are investigating to set if
they can trace the incendiaries or dy
namiters, if there were such.
The fire In the Llewellyn Iron
Works plant, coming immediately aft-'
er the conviction of David Caplan on
a manslaughter charge, has a signifi
cant aspect. This plant was blown up
In 1910 by a fang of alleged union
labor dynamiters, including the Me-Namara-MeManiqal
pronp. John Mc
Namara pleaded guilty to the dyna
miting and was sentenced to serve 14
years in Jhe penetentiary. His broth
er. James, pleaded guilty to murder
In connection with the. Los Angeles
Times dynamiting and was sentenced
to life imprisonment.
David Caplan was alleged to be an
associate of the McNamaras and of
Ortle McManlgal, who turned state's
evidence. " Caplan was arrested at
Port Orchard, Wash., five years after
the Los Angeles Times dynamiting..
He was identified as one of the men
who bousht explosives from a powder
works, which explosive was alleged to'
have besn used on the times Job. Mc
Manlgal, who testified against the Mc
Namaras, was indicted for dynamiting
the Iron works plant". So the two Jobs'
of dynamiting and the two groups o
men are closely: connected by the
events of their trailing down and
trials. ' ' " ;
Capias's trial 'has been In progress
for several weeks. Last night the
jury found him guilty of manslaughter.
