S... r .. . . , 'fl . .. . the,
they ', ":, n i ~r In the uni
verse- ,;is town can at last hold
its head up among decent people
and l,rav\ly de:y any criticism
that might be excited by resi
.dents in other towns that have
absolutely not as much reason
to be proud of themselves as Col
fax has to as proud of itself.
It is to the lasting glory of
Colfax that its women residents,
scandalized and made to worry
by the actions of some of the men
who live here when a carnival
company came here recently, ef
fected last night the passage of
a city ordinance prohibiting the
pc'rflr'ul:t',' e he "' of Clrct':se' ,
street carnivals. vaudeville acts
and ministr el entertainments
whose appeal in even the slight
est degree depends on the pres
ence of women in the exhibitions.
The way some of the citizens
of Colfax, particulary some of
the married men, acted when the
last show came here was the last
straw. Men who had acquired
the art of ir;tdom from embar
rassment by attending other
shows where women performers
came out on the stage and kicked
up their leg'. sat in the very first
row at this last shod', which had
a lot of pretty girls in it, and
laughed and nudged each other,
and winked, when the theatrical
women smikd at them and by
other coy ways tried to make be
lieve they thought the men of
Colfax were "regular dev;is"
like the men with high hats who
hang around stage doors in the
city.
The men didn't know they
were only dupes of these women
who do that in every town the
show goes to. How would shows
get along that didn't do that?
It was just plain temptation and
nothing else. Some of the men
spoke to these theatrical women
afterward and they spent money
like drunken sailors ashore after
a long, long time to sea.
The women of Colfax tried to
close thtir eyes to the e;ei(s
and revtls, but they cuul0 not do
it. They remnt mbered what hap
penied to Pit sburgh wnen some
afoua:d with stage wromeii, and
they decided it was time to step
in and keep this happy and pros
perous town, with it's unblem
ished history and honorable tra
ditions, from going to wreck and
ruin, and so, two hundred signed
a petition demanding that the
civic authorities take th~ meas
ure they took to stamp out vice
and corruption.
This ordin:ance may take away
some of the spirit and hiliarity
of life in Colfax, but if that's
the sort of thing that would'
bring people to Colfax, just look
ing for a " good time " and not
helping to develop it, then we,
don't want that type.
