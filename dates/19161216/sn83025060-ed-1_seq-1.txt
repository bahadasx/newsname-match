FIGURES PROVE PROHIBITION
DOES NOT DECREASE GRIME!
COSTS OVER TWICE AS MUCH TO MAINTAIN ORDER IN
"DRY" GRAYSON THAN IN "WET'' McLENNAN
COUNTY, TEXAS
THIS FACT PUNCTURES ANOTHER THEORY
As Usual, the Taxpayers Have to Shoulder tho Burden
" Reform, Which Has Doubled the Sum They Formerly
Gave Toward Public Improvements
Grayson county, Texas, has been
dry" for ten years and la ono of tho
communities "pointed to with prldo"
, fey tho Anti-Saloon Lcaguo wind-jammers.
McLennan county, Its neigh
tor, In one of the "untcdoemed," but
the Denlson (Texas) Herald Bhows
that It costs more than twice as much
to maintain order In Grayson county
as It does in McLennan county.
Says tho Herald:
"Grayson county enjoys tho reputa
tion of being one of tho cleanest and
Most moral counties In tho state. Her
citizenship Is known far and wldo as
feting of an unusually high order, and
the record the county has made in all
the various walks of lifo blnce it
Moved Into tho dry column has been
quoted from every stump In the state
where the virtue of prohibition has
been proclaimed.
."Disclaiming Intention of distract
feig from the reputation our citizens
Joy for peace and quietude, and for
the advancement wo have made in
education, arts and sciences, yet wo
feci constrained to call attention to
tho fact that If wo are a law-abiding
people, It is costing tho taxpayers an
stormous sum to keep us in tho
straight and narrow path.
Rtcords Prove It.
The records of tho Comptroller's
fflce show that from September 1,
1112, to August 31, 1913, there was
ye.ld to Grayson county officials for
r enforcing the criminal laws of Texas,
17,235 25; for tho year ending August
SI, 1914, $15,831.57; for tho year end
tag August 31, 1915, 925,975.01, making
A total paid to Grayson county officials
fey the state in three years for enforc
ing the criminal laws, $59,041.83. Cor
talnly a most astounding amount, and
considered In any light and from any
Undpolnt, must be amazing to the
taxpayers.
It wilt be well to bear in mind whllo
considering the stupendous sums paid
fey the state for tho enforcement of
tho criminal l-.ws in Grayson county,
Account la not taken of the fees im
posed and collected in misdemeanor
cases offenses tried in tho Justice
ad county courts, whero the defend
ants pay tho cost themselves. When
this la taken Into consideration, tho
thinking man may bo able to form
come conception of what it costs to
maintain tho Judicial machinery of
this goodly prohibition county where

Wine It the favorite beverage of these dounhty warriors. Why la It that the
Prohibitionists never cite the Carman of French aoldlere ra "norrlola exan.
wfeea they declare that liquor
of
crlmo Is popularly supposed to bo
classed with tho lost arts.
'Tor tho purpose of comparison, we
have secured tho snmo data for Mc
Lennan county, whoso population Is
given by the census roport at 75,000,
with n city containing practically half
tho total population and which Is not,
unfortunatoly, under tho benign lnlltt
onco of local option. Tho population
of Grnvson county In round numbers
is 65,000, and It has no large city with
a cosmopolitan population, which Is
goncrally admitted to be bi coder of
crime. According to the Comptroller's
record there was paid to McLennan
county officials by tho stato for enforc
ing tha criminal laws during tho -.car
ondlng August 31, 1913, $5,505 73; for
the year ending August 31, 1914, $10,
291.89; for tho year ending August 31,
1915, $12,569.03, or a total of $28,366.05
for tho threo years In wet McLennan
as against $59,041.83 in dry Grayson.
Prohbltlon Theory Shattered.
"Tho claim is made and Insisted
upon by thoso who favor prohibition
that crime 1b less flagrant In counties
whero tho saloon docs not exist than
in those towns and communities
whore tho liquor llcenso system of ills
pensing Intoxicating liquors prevails
That tho saloons of Toxas nnd tho wef
towns of Texas aro burdening the tax
payers to support the machinery of
tho courts to try causes having tholr
origin and Inspiration In tho open sa
loon. According to tho dntn above
givon, and It Ij absolutely correct, It
would appear that In so far a3 tho two
counties mentioned nro concerned, it
co3t twice aB much moro to enforce
tho criminal laws In a dry county.
"This article Is not written In de
fense of the saloon or as nn nrgument
that tho Grayson county local option
law should be repealed. Its purpose Is
to show tho fallacy of tho contention
that tho adoption of prohibition lea
sons crlmo and reduces taxation. Be
foro Grayson county v. as placed Into
tho dry column, tho money it received
from tho licenses holped bear tho cost
of government and of enforcing tho
law. Now It rccoived no rovonuo from
that sourco and tho burden of tho law
enforcement has moro than doubled.
"Tho figures nro presented as food
for thought and perhaps It may lead
to Investigation, followed by explana
tion on tho part of thoso charged with
enforcement of tho law, as to why it
cost moro to maintain order In Gray
son county than It docs In McLennan.

No Private Property Is Safo
From Puritanism, Says Ed
ward A. Gore Foreign Coun
tries All Reimburse Victims
of Prohibition, Only America
Confiscates i
Declaring that prohibition, in estab
lishing tho prlnclplo that tho property
of tho liquor man can bo confiscated
without compensation, is establishing
tho sarao rulo with rcspoct to any
other Industry that Puritanism may
select for destruction, Edward A. Goro,
Influential member of the Chicago As
sociation of Commorco, took occasion
to give his views on compensating the
liquor man. "Tho trcatmont accorded
tho liquor man is unjust and un
American," ho declared.
"Onco let tho prlnclplo becomo es
tablished that property In ono lino of
business may bo destroyed, that the
owner may bo despollod of his prop
erty, and tho samo rule will bo held
good with rcspoct to other property
that thoso who aro overcharged with
Puritanism may select for destruc
tion," said Gore.
A Challenge To Liberty.
"Wo havo long hold oursolvos up to
bo citizens of a country which Invites
tho oppressed of ovory land to come
to its shores nnd hero find freodom
of opportunity, hero find tho protec
tion of laws guaranteeing equality of
all. In the light or tho trcatmont the
liquor men havo mot with, I am afraid
that that proud boast of America must
be challenged. Freedom has been
ours, but there seems to bo an cle
ment of Puritanism In our country
which would tread freedom down and
erect in its stead Bomothlng masque
rading in its habiliments which ovon
the old Puritan would have repudiated
as representing what must bo the
prlnclplos of this country. Wo need
to stop and take noto of the fact that
If this thing is to continuo, tho liber
ties of which wo have boasted wilt
all molt away; and the man who
claims to bo a free man in America
la making a claim that ho can not sus
tain.
"You are familiar, no doubt, with
tho legislation that transpired In
Switzerland when it was proposed to
destroy tho absinthe Industry; you no
doubt recall that when that matter
was pending in the loglslatlvo body In
Switzerland a member of that body
arose and said that he did not think
that compensation was necessary bo
causo in the United States compensa
tion wan not provided whon prohi
bition prevailed; and immediately
from every side of tho legislative as
sembly there arose a protest to the
effect that no matter what tho United
States had or had not dono, the legisla
tive body of Switzerland would enact
no law that had about It any sus
picion of dishonesty? Aa a result,
the measure Anally adopted provided
for compensation to the farmer who
raised the absinthe plant, to hln em
ployes, to the distiller who distilled it
aad his en ploy e, to tho dealer whs
Marketed it aad his employes.
