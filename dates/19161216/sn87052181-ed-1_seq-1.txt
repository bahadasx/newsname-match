WOULD HELP THE CHILDREN
Social Workers Planning to Present
a Juvenile Code of Laws to tho
Legislature This Winter.
A determined fight will bo wast'd
beforo tho Missouri Legislature this
winter for a code of laws to belter tho
condition of children ln the stato. Tho
series of bills that will bo Introduced
were drafted by a commission of twen-ty-ono
social workers, judges and oth
ers interested In tho cause of child
welfare. The bills are known ns "Tho
Children's Code."
Tho bills relate to the caro of dostl
luto and neglected children, delinquent
children, defective children and to
children who work. Moro than 18,000
children between tho ages of 10 and
13 work with 31,000 moro between 1
and 15 years, old. bout fivo hundred I.
children got ln tho Jails of Missouri !
throughout tho year; one-third of tho
alms houses shelter little children,
while there aro several thousand fco-
bio minded children who cannot bo
properly cared for because of lack of j
accommodations for them at tho stato j
Institutions.
Tho children's Code for tho most
part consists of proposed laws to cor
rect the conditions which bring about
much of tho poverty, feeblo mlnded
ncss and delinquency on tho part of
children. Coupled with them aro gen
eral provisions for tho caro of chil
dren. Whilo thcro aro twenty proposed
laws In tho code, tho principal f.gi't
will bo waged for threo measures.
They are:
County boards of public welfare, con
sisting of members of tho county
court, tho county superintendent of
schools and tho judgo hearing chil
dren's cases this board to appoint a

Missouri School of Mines at Rolla '
Seeks Method of Conserving Cadl
mum at Zinc Plants.
Experiments on a method to savo
millions of dollars' worth of cadmium
that now goes to wasto annually In
tho Joplln Mining district, will be un
dertaken by the Missouri School of
Mines at Rolla, which 1ms interested
tho mine operators in means ot re
claiming lead ore through tho oil flo
tation treatment.
Prof. A. L. McRae, director of tho
school, has been authorized to em
ploy an expert for tho cadmium in
vestigation, by tho executivo commit
tee at a meeting of tho curators of tho
Missouri University at Kansas City.
'If tho cadmium In the zinc ores
mined annually In tho Joplln district
wero recovered, it would amount to
four times the total cadmium market
ed in the world at tho present time,"
Professor McRao said. "Mo3t of this
cadmium is now thrown away. A
small amount of it is recovered ln
New Jersey for cadmium yellow paint.
It also is used for tho filament of
tungsten lights and may bo used to
prevent rust ln iron. It was only re
cently that a lead company ln South
east Missouri became curious as to
tho value of a large quantity of yellow
substance that had accumulated on the
floor of Its bag house. Investigation
showed there was about $100,000 worth
of cadmium."
Cadmium is mincl with zinc and Is
similar to It In appearance.

of tho world to Journey

Then came tho war, cruel, de

mobilized her nrmy nnd ever since
tho nnclent itelvrtlnn republic has
been described ns "m Island of pence
In n son of wnr."
Tq (hose who know her, Switzerland
In summer represents n master study
In nrtlstle color combinations; Switz
erland In winter, however, Is n totally
different vision, radiant In dazzling,
spotless white. Jack Frost has Im
printed a silencing kiss upon tho bnb
Ming lips of every tiny brook nnd
mountnin stream, nnd glistening
sheets of the smoothest ico cover nlsn
the llmlpld blue eyes of ponds nnd
Alpine hikes. AVhlle mother earth Is
lhus wrapped In n wonderful mantle
of Ico nnd snow, tho sky above has
assumed the matchless hue of n pro
dons sapphire, nnd the nlwnys deli
cious mountnin ulr seems to have nc
quired some additional qualities which
Tejuvennte nnd strengthen the whole
human system nnd which instill Into
every being, young or old, nn inexpll
cable feeling of light-hearted hnppl
ness. Very shortly, one finds every
body Interested and engaged In some
form of winter sport.
There Is skntlng, of course, but
many games compete now with this
oldest of sports on the Ice, which has,
however, been developed Into nn art
which charms the onlooker by the
gracefulness nt Its movements, nnd
ngnln astonishes by the cool daring of
Its swift rushes.
As in summer over the lnwn, so flies
tho tennis bnll over tho Ice ln the
game of hockey. Curlers nre frantical
ly sweeping their "stones" Inward the
coveted goal, nnd the unlimited di
versity of gymkhana stunts offers con
stant amusement for tho players ns
well ns for tho onlookers.
Tho Improved appliances for sport
requirements have nearly ousted tho
old-fashioned herdsmen's sleds which
aro now only occasionally used by
timid beginners. The up-to-date ve
hicle Is the so-called skeleton, n low.
yard-long tnboggnn, on which the

hands nnd feet. Like nn arrow, It

the different mountnin railways, which
In winter run toboggan trains. Thus

nnd without waste of time. Then one
descends to the vnlley on toboggan,
ski or skates, or vice versa, goes
down first nnd returns by train to
winter quarters.
Races, competitions, ski excursions,
sleigh drives, ice carnivals nnd nn
equnl variety of fascinating Indoor en
tertainments transplant the happy
winter visitor Into u totally different
world where sorrow nnd care seem to
be bnnlshed nnd where every human

A pretty legend ubout the origin ot
the Christmas tree tells us that in tho
beginning of the ninth century a cer
tain St. Wlnfried went to preach;
Christinnlty to tho people In Scandi
navia nnd northern Germany. Onq
Christmas eve these people were gath
ered round n huge oak to offer n hu
man sacrifice, nccordlng to the Druid
priests, but St. Wlnfried hewed down
tho great tree, nnd as It felt there npi
penred ln Its place n tall young fir.
When St. Wlnfried saw It he cried to
the people that here was como n new
tree, unstained by blood, which, In
pointing to the sky, showed them what
they were to worship.
"It is tho Christ Child," he said.
"Carry It to the castle of your chief,
nnd In future. Instead of the bloody
rites of the Druids, your worship shalj
bo ln your own homes, with cere
monies thnt speak the message of
peace nnd good will to all. A day,
will como when there shall not be a
houso in the North wherein on tho"
birthday of Christ the whole family
shall not gather together round the
fir tree In memory of this dny and to
the glory of tho only God."
