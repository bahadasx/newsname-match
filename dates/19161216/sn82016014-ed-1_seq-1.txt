In 1910, shortly after tha Los An

a fire started by a bomb, a bomb was
exploded in an attempt to destroy the
Liwellyn plant.
The subsequent apprehension and

AWAIT LLOYD-GEORGE SPEECH,
U. S. Offer of Mediation ow
Might Retard Peace.
Uncle Sam Acting Merely as
Belligerents' Go-Between.
Washington. Dec. 18. President
Wilson believes the door is closing up
on the great war struggle abroad and
that before long the time will come for
the friendly services of neutrals.
But he is convinced that the imme
diate present is not the opportune
time for the United States to extend
anv mediation offer. Hence he is
awaiting developments which will
follow receipt of all the central pow
ers peace proposals by their enemies.
He is giving a tremendous amount
of study of all angles of the situation
having before him Germany's quasi
official peace terms, a mass of con
fidential information from the Ameri
can embassy at Berlin and every atom
of available information as to the
grounds upon which the allies would
enter a conference looking to termi
nating the war.
Especially is he interested in learn
ing the contents of Premier Lloyd
George's speech to parliament next
week. He has made it clear to those
in his confidence that he would take
no step toward mediation until sure it
would be successful. Until that time
came, "anything said or done imme
diately by this government, not only
would not help the movement toward
peace but would actually retard, it,"
say his closest friends.

have the United States as a medium

GERMANY READY
Willing to GUe .Allies Full
Statement of Terms.
Also to Discuss Disarmament
and World Peace.
Washington, Dec. 16. Germany
stands ready to give the allies a full
statement of terms in a peace confer
ence. This statement was made officially
today by Ambassador von Bernstorff
following a short conference with
Secretary Lansing today.
Berni?torff said he does not know
officially what terms these are. The
Teutons' terms. Bernstorff said, would
be freely given the entente allies at
any conference to be held.
At the same time Germany is also
ready to discuss disarmament, crea
tion of a league to guarantee perma
nent peace and kindred subjects that
would arise from any peace negotia
tions. Xot Discouraged by XT. S. Silence.
The envoy's visit to the state depart
ment was brief. He sought official
word confirming this country's inten
tion not to supplement Germany's
peace proposals at this time.
While Bernstorff refused to talk
about this - government's plan, it is
known that , German authorities are
not discouraged in any way by the fact
that America will not now urge any
suggestions.
on the contrary they believe Presi
dent Wilson "has left the -way open to
act later" and hence are aDDarentlv
1 encouraged by this fact.

El Paso, Texas, Dec. 16. Wholesale
arrests of Americans and Mexicans
here and at other points along the
border, accused of breach of the neu
trality laws in fomenting or aiding
the revolutionary actions of different
Mexican factions, are planned by
United States secret service agents.
Members of the various revolutionary
juntas are now under surveillance by
this government's agents, but action
is held in abeyance pending ratifica
tion of the American-Mexican media
tion protocol.
One of the clauses of the protocol
provides for the deportation of unde
sirable aliens engaged in revolutionary
activities.
Got Ammunition From U. S.
The secret service men have been
directing their attention, since the
capture of Chihuahua City by Villistas
to the source of part of the ammuni
tion supply used by Villa which was
not captured from Mexican govern
ment forces.
Positive evidence has been obtained
that Villa received twenty-eight thou
sand cartridges the night before the
fall of the northern capital. Federal
authorities here believe these came
from the American side of the border.
That Villa is disposing his troops for
another important movement was in
dicated in all reports to United States
authorities here today. An employe
of the Babicora ranch, arriving here,
stated that Quevado's band of Villis
tas which has been holding the town
of Bachiniva during the past month,
has consolidated with the Acosta band
guarding the, wounded at Guerrero.

' Damaged field- pieces and machine

A large body ofVillistas has swung
around Chihuahua City to the south,
cutting communication north of Santa
Rosalia and the bandits are holding
the latter town.
At the Mexican consulate here, Mex
ican officials state they have no in
formation as to whether any active
campaign is under way against Villa.
PACKERS PAY FINE

$12,500 Each.
Penalty Compromised; Violated
I Anti-Trust Laws.
Jefferson City, Mo., Dec. 16. Five
packing companies each paid $12,500
into the state treasury today it was
announced in settlement of the fines
of $25,000 imposed upon them by the
Missouri supreme court for violation
of the state anti-trust laws.

agreement with John T. Barker, attor
ney general, that but half of the fines
should be paid.

States supreme court, and paid all
cost of the prosecution. Bach has
submitted a statement to the supreme
court promising to obey the laws of
! the state and the orders of the court
j and, upon this showing, they will be
permitted to continue to do business
i in the state. As an alternative, the
'entire fines would be collected and

$2 FOR EACH SOLDIER
I .aw Dormant Half Century Is Invoked
to Stimulate Recruiting.
Washington-. -Dec. 16? A law passed
more than half a century ago and in--operative
since the Civil war is to be
invoked by the war department to
stimulate army recruiting. The old
statute, unearthed by .Adjutant Gen
eral McCain, provides for payment'
of $2 to any civilian for each man he
persuades to enlist in the a'rmy. Gen
eral McCain suggested to Secretary
Baker that congress be asked to ap
propriate not more than $50,000 to
pay the bonuses. His plan is to so
licit recruits mainly thru retired en
listed men and he believes the pay
ment would incite them to active can
vass of men likely to join the army.
WHEAT CUT 21 CTS
Peace Rumor Also Causes Corn
and Oats Decline.
But Chance of War Ending Is
Impetus to Provisions.
Chicago. Dec. 16. (Weekly Grain
and Provisions.) Big shrinkages in
the price of wheat have been caused
during the last week by Germany's
offer to make peace and by German
suggestions of a plan for limited but
universal disarmament. Net declines
in wheat values ranged from 15
cents to 21 cents.
Other setbacks in quotations were:
Corn 2 hi to 3 cents and oats 5 cents
to 6 cents. Provisions scorea gains
of 20 cents to 90 cents.
Previous to Tuesday, when the news
of Chancellor von Bethmann-Holl-weg's
announcement of peace over
tures carried the wheat market head
long downward HYt cents, the senti
ment of traders appeared to depend
chiefly on varying prospects regarding
export business. Hopes of a revival
of sales to foreigners were succeeded
by a virtual complete stoppage of de
mand from Kurope and a rise in ma
rine insurance rates had made sales
to Europe nearly impossible.
Difficulties over the submarine is
sue between Germany and the United
States also were becoming acute. Un
favorable reports fror.i London and
other allied capital as to the peace out
look turned the wheat market moder
ately upgrade on Wednesday, but on
Thursday indications ot- a willingness
on the part of Great Britain to call
for a statement of Germany's proposed
terms of peace resulted in the begin
ning of a new decline in prices. It
was not until yesterday tho that the
break reached a sensational climax and
that chiefly on account of the move
for disarmament, the market collapsed
in a few hours 13 hi cents a bushel.
Corn held remarkably stable despite
the weakness of wheat. Export busi
ness in corn has of late been relatively
unimportant, and owing to the railway
embargoes, stocks have not piled up
as usual at terminals. On the other
hand, sacrifice sales by holders who
had been relying on a continuance of
military demand was a weakening in
fluence on oats. The rise in provisions
was generally ascribed mainly to the
enlarging chanc8 of peace.

TROUBLE IN BATTERY?
Wilson Returns to Fort Riley After
Talk With Adjutant General.
Frank Wilson, private in Battery A,
whom the Topeka police had orders
to pick up and detain Friday, returned
to Fort Riley and joined his battery
Friday evening. He spent Friday at
the office of the adjutant general at
the state house. .
Apparently there was come mistake
in connection with the orier. The
telegram was received from Captain
Hite of the battery and contained no
explanations. Wilson's friends stated
today that he came to Topeka to see
Captain Hite and that the latter re
turned to Fort Riley before Wilson
reached Topeka. It was intimated to
day that there is trouble in Battery
A and that it may, be aired once the
men are mustered out.

enable consumers to buy in quantity
from the producers, eliminating all
