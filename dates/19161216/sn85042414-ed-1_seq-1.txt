Bffll ANOTHER DYNAMITE ATTACK
Several Explosions Were
Reported to Have
Occurred.
M'NAMARA DYNAMIT
ED THE PLANT IN 1910
Major Portion of Place in
Flames When Firemen
Arrive.
Los Angeles Dec. 16.—Fire early
today nearly wiped out the plant of
the Llewellyn Iron works, causing
damage estimated at more than $600,
000. Several explosions were report
ed. to have occurred and the police
were investigating .to determine
whether they were, incidental to the
Are or whether the plant had been
dynamited.
John f. McXamara, former secre
tary-treasurer of the International
Union of Bridge and Structural Iron
Workers,is serving.a.sentence In San
Quentin, Cal., for the. dynamiting of
this place! in 1910, to which he con
fessed.
The Are was said by the Police to
have started in the same part of the
establishment as that wrecked by the
tomb explosion in 1910.
By the time the Are department ar
rived, the major portion of the plant
was in Hames. Fifty men were in the
plant. The lire started apparently in
the office building, but spread with
such rapidity that the men had dif
ficulty in .escaping. When the fire
r.k i) iirl-Ived, the«ivtire plant .••ooenpy
ing two full squares, was in flames.
The roof of, the office quarters .fell
In-& few minutes after the fire equip
ment was in action and the street on
which the plant fronts, in places was
blockaded by wreckage.
The flames reached across th#1 street
to the Lacy Manufacturing plant, but
damage there was not great.
Concern was expressed as to the
possible destruction of many blue
prints and records of costs and other
office material which they said were
valued at more than a million dollars.
LW.W. DEFENSE
Nearly all of Money Collect
ed to Help Duluth Men
is Gone.
Chicago, Dec. 16.—Although several
thousand dollars were collected for
the defense of the I. W. W- members,
accused of manslaughter in connec
tion with .the strike of that organiza
tion in the Minnesota Iron range, lit
tle remains, despite the fact that three
of the accused, men pleaded guilty and
were sentenced at Duluth yesterday,
according to William Haywood, secre
tary of the I. W. w.
"James .Gllday of Virginia handled
the fund. and no doubt can a'ccount
for it," said Mr. Haywood. "It is to
be remembered that, several of the
defendants were not prosecuted and
that preliminary work of lawyers and
investigators which contributed to the
g»e
eneral result, was paid for out of
fund. What remains doubtless
will be sent to the state of Washing
ton to assist members in trouble
there."

VICTORY OURS,
KAISER SAYS,
SO ASKED PEACE
lip to the Enemy to Decide
Whether War Shall Go
on, He Tells Troops.
If They Have Not Had
Enough, He says Soldiers
Will Give it to Them.
T-iondon. Dec. 16.—"Confident that
we are completely the victors,. I yes
terday made a proposal to the enemy
to discuss the question of further war
or peace," said the German emperor
in addressing the troops in Alsace
recently, according to a dispatch
.pybUsJi^d'ln the Cologne Gazette, says
a .Ueuters'v 4ispatc.h from Amst'er-,
dam. ....
"'What will come of It., I do not yet
know," the emperor is reported to
have continued. "It is a matter for
the enemy now to decide if the fight
ing is to. still go on. If the enemy
still thinks he has not had enough,
then I know you will"—here the em
peror. says the correspondent, made
a "warlike gesture" which "produced
a fierce smile oil the faces of all his
men."
The steadfastness of the troops in
the west, he said, the dispatch con
tinues, had made it possible to deal
destructive blows in the east. He
spoke, the correspondent relates, in
"words most wrathful in contempt
of that people in the east which had
thought to stick a dagger in the back
of our ally."
The judgment of God has fallen
on them, the emperor declared, In
the campaign which had been con
ducted according to the brilliant plan
of Field Marshal von Hlndenburg.
Afterward, the correspondent
states, the emperor, talked to the of
ficers for a half hour on the Ruman
ian campaign, which he is said to
have described as "the irony of fate"
which had permitted the corn pur
chased by the English to fall into
German hands.
"The English," the correspondent
quotes the emperor as saying, "paid
for it. We eat It and this has been
called a war of starvation."

DIES WHILE
BEFORE CLASS
Famous Psychology Pro
fessor of Harvard.
Succumbs..
Seized With Fainting Spell
While Talking to
Students.
Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 16.—Hugo
Munsterberg, professor of psychology
of Harvard university, died suddenly
today while lecturing before a class at
Radcltffe college.
Professor Munsterberg, on the lec
ture platform, was seized with what
seemed to be a fainting spell. Some of
the young members of his class, of
which there were sixty, went to his
side and, then, called on the college
physician. Dr. Jewett. The latter
reached the stricken teacher just be
fore he expired-
Well known in educational circles
for many years. Professor Munster
berg became prominent publicall.v
soon after the great war began. A
German by birth, he presented in ad
dresses and in written articles the
attitude of the Teutonic allies as he
understood it. Gradually he came to
be regarded as a spokesman in New
England for many Germans and oth
ers who favored Germany. As a re
sult, he was brought into contro
versies with other members of the
Harvard faculty, who were outspoken
in the defense of the allies.
Professor Munsterberg was born in
Danzig, Germany, in 1863 and after
distinguished work as an educator In
his native land came to Harvard in
1892 as professor of psychology.
He was twice decorated by the Ger
man emperor.

Berlin. Dec. 18—(Delayed in Trans
mission^— A military official who is
frankly and keenly hopeful that some
way may be found to end the war,
though he is none too optimistic, to
day called together representatives of
the neutral press to inquire as to the
probable effect of the German peace
note in neutral countries. He laid
great stress on this point and par
ticularly whether there probably
would be any tendency to construe
the German note as sign of weakness.
Discussing the possibility that all
peace propositions may be rejected at
present, this office declared Germany
was aware the French and British
would make another herculean effort
In
1
the west next spring—im effort
for which Germany would be ,fuMr
prepared. He expressed the opinion
that it could not have any result oth
er than continued slaughter and that
it would have no more prospect of
success than the Somme offensive.
In the meantime, this officer. con
Germany would not give Rus
sia time to recuperate, as happened
a year ago.

London, Dec. 16.—It appeared
doubtful today whether Premier
David Lloyd George will be able to
go before the house of commons on
Tuesday next. He is making steady
progress towards recovery, but it Is
considered unlikely that his physician
will allow him to speak next week,
as his voice is affected. At any rate,
It Is not expected that the govern
ment, by that time, will be in a posi
tion to make a statement regarding
the German peace proposals.
Philip Snowden, socialist member
for Blackburn, one of the leaders of
the small pacifist group In the houss
of commons, has made it known that
he Intends to state the views of that
group In the commons. Its members
believe that negotiations should be
opened, if only to state the terms of
the entente to the central powers.
The ^Westminster Gazette today
says it will be found that Mr. Snow
den Is by no means an advocate of
peace at any price and that his party
has very deflnlte. views as to the re
paration which Germany should make.
The belief of this group that Ger
many is prepared to grant reasonable
terms is not. however, ,says the news

WASHBURN BANKER
RECOVERING TODAY
Artillery Levels German Defenses, After Which Infantry,
Protected by Curtain of Steel, Dashed
Forward, Overcoming Enemy.
9,000 PRISONERS AND 80 GUNS ARE CAPTURED
It Was Nivelle's Last Act Before Assuming Command of
Western Army—Quiet Preparations Made for
Weeks—Blow Comes Like Thunderbolt.
Paris, Dcc. 16.—As his list act before assuming the
chief command of the French army on the western front,
General Nivelle today smashed the German line east of the
Meuse along a front of six miles. The victory has advanc
ed the French position two miles and they are now within
a short distance of where the Germans stood at the outset
of the great Verdun drive. The military authorities de
scribe the victory as complete and crushing and carried out
without a hitch.
Since his last great stroke, when the blood-soaked
ruins of Fort Vaux and Douamont fell once more into the
hands of Verdun's defenders. General Nivelle has been
quietly preparing to push his advantage by an attack on a
larger scale. Men and guns had been assembled, shells
piled and everything was in readiness for the movement
when the general should see his opportunity. Then, the
blow fell like a thunderbolt. A terrific artillery prepara
tion flattened the German defenses, then the guns were el
evated and threw a curtain of steel behind which the in
fantry from every trench from Pepper hill to beyond Dam
loup dashed forward on an enemy still stunned by the bom
bardment.
In places the Germans galjantly strove to hold their
ground, but General Niyell&'s dispositions were so well
made that they were generi^r powerfess to stem the.tide.
The large number of prisoners, according to latest ail
vices., nearly 9,000, is an indication of the surprise nature
of the onset. Eighty guns were captured. The news of
the victory was received in Paris with enthusiasm as a
welcome relief to the gloomy tidings from Rumania. Gen
eral Nivelle is the man of the hour. His latest achieve
ment justifies, it is felt, his choice as commander in chief
and augurs well for the future.
VERDUJf HOEDS INTEREST.
Momentarily, the western front Is again the center of attraction.
with the French victory at Verdun oacupylng the chief place in the war
news. General Nivelle's stroke has brought the French back, accord
ing to their reports nearly to the line they occupied when the Germans
began their great drive for Verdun last February. Today's dispatches
report that the German Crown Prince's troops lost nearly 9,000 men in
prisoners and 80 guns during the French advance, which was effected
to a depth of approximately of two miles along a six-mile front.
