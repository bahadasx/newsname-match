SOUTH CAROLINA MILITIA
EVICT TEXTILE STRIKERS
By DANTE BARTON.
ANDERSON, S. C., Dec. 15.—Five companies of state militia
are quartered in the villages of Gluck and Equinox, this state.
In both of those villages the children of the workers can't go
to school. The militia men occupy the schoolhouses.
Five companies of militia men are over-aweing 700 workers on
a strike. The strikers asked for a 10 per cent increase in pay from
the Wellington-Sears Corporation of Boston, which corporation owns
th frills here. The company refused to treat with or recognize
,th/employes because they formed a union.
When the strike was declared the company ordered all employes
to get out of the company houses and closed the school to quarter
the militiamen. The school land is owned by the company.
Down in Anderson, S. C., these 700 men, women and children
are on the perilous fringe of starvation, or are leaving their homes
in exile because they dare to exercise their lawful right of union
organization and in the name of that union, the United Textile
Workers of America, to demand a slight increase in their meager
wages.
Up in Boston, Mass., live the^
northern owners of those two south
ern mills. Those northern owners
are the members and officers of the
powerful, wealthy Wellington-Sears
corporation. Rich, powerful and ir­
responsible, William H. Wellington,
president of the company S. E. Well­
ington, secretary Joseph N. Jackson,
treasurer, and other owners of the
company, hide their real responsibility
for the brutality of repression
T/racticed against their southern
orlters. They hide their respon­
sibility behind cruel, arbitrary acts of
their local superintendent, Robert i^.
Ligon, who says to these men, women
and children:
"Yes, we can afford the small 10
per cent increase you have asked, we
can give that and more, easily but
not a damn cent will be given while
you people belong to a tmion." When
arbitration was offered by the state
board, the workers accepted the offer,
but the corporation refused it abso­
lutely.
Careless, prosperous, powerful,
these Wellington-Sears owners as­
sume not only to own the mills, but
to own the workers. They own the
earth about their plants, and tell
these workers to get out. They
brought eviction suits under a pro­
bably lawless law which permitted
only 10 days', notice to the tenants.
They brought these suits before a
magistrate who at one time had been
president of one of the companies.
When the judgments were given by
this magistrate, Sheriff Ashley, friend
and neighbor of the "peaceful strikers,
refused to put the men, women and
children into the street. When ord­
ered by the governor to do so, this
right-feeling olficer sent hack word
that he would nat evict families until
those families re assured before­
hand of a roof ov*r their heads and
lie told Governor Manning that if the
governor did not lite this statement,
Manning could go ani put the famil­
ies out himself.
It was right there tl.at this power­
ful, irresponsible corpoiation of Bos­
ton proved what it coulc do through
the governor of South Caiolina. That
governor immediately ordered five
companies of Coast Artillfc-y militia
to go to Anderson, S. C., to
?0
to the
little mill villages of Gliok and
Equinox, and put the striker* out
their homes. And the people of the
whole state of South Carolina must
pay $4,000 per week while hose
artillery militia men overawe the
men, women and children of tieir
own state at the behest of the disint
arbitrary corporation.
In the schoolhouses of Gluck, whdie
little children of the workers used
get the meager education allowed
them, now a company of South Caro­
lina soldiers are quartered.
