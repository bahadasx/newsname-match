SCHOOLGIRLS LURED
BY MOVIE ROUTE TO
DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND
(Newspaper Enterprise Association.)
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 16.—School girls from as far north as Tacoma and
Seattle, lured from their homes by glittering promises of careers as movie
actresses, are being carried across the border line into the hell holes of Tiajuana,
Mexico.
Already known as the "Devil's Playground," Tiajuana is adding to its un
healthy reputation as the vilest place on the American continent.
Cadets for the squalid brothels of the night life there are on the hunt for
fresh material to fill gaps in the ranks of the unfortunates. Young girls of the j
public and high school age are preferred by these agents who stop at nothing,
in their campaign of recruiting. THE YOUNG GIRLS LAST LONGER.
Three victims of this organized traffic in human flesh have just made
their escape from imprisonment at Tiajuana and have told their stories to Cal
ifornia officials.
These three girls, now being eai-ed for by Y.-W. C. A. workers, said they had
been promised positions in a motion picture company. They met "movie men,"
agents from Tiajuana, in Los Angeles. A visit to a cafe. The old story of drug
ged wine. When they awoke they were behind the barred windows of the dens
in Tiajuana.
They managed to escape sometime later on "Visitor's Day." Throngs from
the races swarmed through the gambling joints and the dance halls. The girls
mingled with the crowd and boarded automobile busses which run from Tia
juana across the line into California.
"Lots of other girls are down therewbo went the same way we did," they
told the authorities.
This is only one instance of operations by white slave gangsters from the
"fast little town" across the line.

Along this trestle will be con

JURY FINDS
PIERWSZA IS
NOT GUILTY
BY MABEL ABBOTT
"Not guilty," read Judge Clifford, at a few min
utes after 10 o'clock Saturday morning, when the
jury returned to the courtroom after deliberating for
four hours Friday evening and two hours in the morn
ing, over the guilt or innocence of John Pierwssa,
who has been on trial for nine days for the murder of
his wife in Wilkeson Oct. 30.
The room was crowded with spectators who had
poured in to hear the verdict.
Pierwsza was pale, but he did not break down. Hia
lips quivered as his attorneys shook his hand.
"By gosh, 1 figure myself maybe it be all right,
but —" he broke off and did not complete the sen
tence, as he walked down the hill after it was all over.

"Yes, sure I go back to Wilkeson. Dat my job. I

go to Chicago to see my Bister. 1 send her from news
papers all clippings every day, and right away first
day she go to bed. She couldn't stand it. I send her
a telegram now."
Pierwsia'l pockmarked face broke into i smile.
"I got a sister and two brudder in this country. I
send them tickets to the old country to come here, and
my wife sister I send him one too. And 1 got a brud

"Yes, I guess I got some friends in Wilkeson, may
be—anybody got friends if he got nionev in his pock

Pierwasa shrugged his shoulders and his hands
flew out.
"Oh, yes, J go back to Wilkeaun to \u^k." he added.
