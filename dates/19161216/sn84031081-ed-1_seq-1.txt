Throe Separate Notes.
In Knglaiid, l-'raiice and Japan this
government represents all three Teu
tonic countries and will, therefore, de
liver three separate tpilcs In Rus

will have to send on two separate
notes, only to Belgium, where Aus
tria is represented, and to Ituniiinla,
where Germany Is represented, will It
bo possible to send only one note.
To avoid duplication on cai'les by
sending several copies of the same
rote to the same country, and also
to Insure one official version for all
three notes nil! listed to this govern

translation will be made ar the depart

eif the American Newspaper Publish
ers' association and others, were meet
ing, small publishers conferred to de
cide what should be their attitude to
ward the distribution proposal which
many of their number favored hecuuso
It would assure them of at least some
supply of patter. Tonight representa
tives of all the publishers met together
to form a committee to meet the trade
commission, the manufacturers and
the jobbers Tuesday. They sought to
amalgamate their policies as far lis
their Interests would permit, so as to
nvold a division in their ranks In to
morrow's conferences.
Any distribution plan that might b
winked out according to tho repre
sentatives of the largo papers, would
force the bigger publications to accept
on coiitracl smaller quantities of pu
ller for next year than their actual
needs rciiiire. This, they declare,
would force, them In the open market
for iho remainder, making It neces
sary for them to bid against smaller
.newspaper owners, who do not buy en
contract, or who buy In small quanti
ties, thereby raising the price to stl'l
I i,:ber levels.
Collusion Is Mlcgcrl.
' There Was Indication of a growing
bclp-f among publishers today that a
.complaint filed with the department
of justice against the paper manufac
turers several days should be pressed.
It. charged collusion to ralso price
and disci iniiiiation against certain
manufacturers in refusing to sell to
them.
Publishers w ho met here today did
not comment on news from New York
'that n, ,-mbers of the federal trade
commission who will meet manufac
turers there had received a proposal
that the commission fix A flat priee
