London, Dec. 15. The Russian
Duma has unanimously passed a reso
lution against the acceptance of the
Teuton peace proposals, according to
a Reuter dispatch from Petrograd.
which adds that this action followed a
spirited address bV the Minister of
Foreign Affairs. The resolution, r.s
received here, reads:
The Duma, having heard the state
ment by the Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, unanimously favors a categori
cal refusal by the Allied Govern
ments to enter, under present condi
tions, Into any peace negotiations
whatever.
It considers that the German pro
posals are nothing more than fresh
proof of the weakness of the enemy
and a hypocritical act from which the
enemy expects no real success, but
by "which It seeks to throw upon
others the responsibility for the war
and for what happened during it, and
to exculpate itself before public opin
ion in Germany.
The Duma considers that a prema
ture peace would not only be a brief
period of calm, but would also involve
the danger of another bloody war and
a renewal of the deplorablo sacrifices
by the people. It considers that a
lasting peace will be possible only af
ter a decisive victory over the mili
tary power of the enemy and after
definite renunciation by Germany of
the aspirations which i oudct her re
sponsible for the world war and for
the horrors by which it has beeu ac
companied. Bumps

Improving roads with a motor car
is a suflicicntly new proposition to
appeal to many car owners as good
sport. It Is fun if one isn't obliged
to do it.
An ordinary road drai? simply con
structed of Umbei s about six by eight
inches, seven feet long and faced with
hand Iron, will work wonders if used
with reasonable frequency on a
crowned road. Ruts can bo filled
and the road smoothed on a Hat after
it is nearly dry, but such places
should all be built up as soon as pos
sible when the regular use of the
drag will keep them rounded up,
smoothed of ruts and in time, the
traveled surface will become very
hard.
Most cor owners know of more
than one section of road accessible
to thim which they could greatly Im
prove by keeping a drag there, goini;
out with their car at opportune times,
hitching on and dragging it over a
few times. Any car of fair weight
and power can bo used for this work
without the least damage to the car,
if ft Is properly handled. No attempt
should be made to drive In other than
low gear and take it easy in that
gear. If the speedometer never reg
isters over four miles per hour, the
car will do more than a days work
for a team in less than two hours. N'o
modern car In good order should heat
up at this work.
The accompanying iilustrution
shows the Hudson Super Six owned
by E. V. Williams drawing a town
road drag. Mr. Williams, being much

AMERICANS KILL THEMSELVES
Hurry and Eat Themselves Into Their
Graves.
New York, Dec. 15. This nation Is
physically unprepared, tho Associa
tion of Lifo Insurance Presidents,
which began its tenth annual meeting
in the Hotel Astor, was told jester
day by K. 13. Rittenhouse. commis
sioner of public service and conserva

Society.
it was a gloom Inspiring sketch of
the average American that Mr. Rit
tenhouso held up beforo the insur
ance authorities. Sehopenhatirer,
the philosopher; Malthus, the econ
omist; Strindberg, the playwright,
and Jeremiah, tho prophet, would
have been cheerful alongside Mr. Rit
tenhouso. "Our physical American," Raid Mr.
Rittenhouse, "looks smooth, pink and
healthy. 'He Is a good liver I said
is, not has. He hurries. He has no
time to waste. The average age of
the American people at death is about
43. He is trying, with the aid of ne w
knowledge and inventions, to crowd
the experiences of two lifetimes Into
one. He Is having some success, but
the strain is telling upon him.
"His hair has aged and he is get
ting bald. Nature asks why hirsute
protection Is needed indoors. His
eyes have been strained by close fo

that they are showing signs of rebel

Ills heart, arteries, kidneys, nerves
and digestion, as the rapidly increas

"He is more than well. rounded at

ed the idea that pleasure cars could
be used to work on the roads without
injury to the car. J. L. Davis, the
IJennington County supervisor of
roads, did not know of the experiment
having boiu tried. Mr. Davis was
much interested and gave his consent
to the co-operation of Albert Harmon
our patrolman. Mr. Williams fur
nished two large cars to wtrk on the
town roads and villago streets at each
suitable) occasion from the first ex
periment until the arrival of the
snow. Much good work was done
end many points learned that will bo
of great value next season. Mr. Wil
liams says that had ho started to
work out this idea last spring, he
feels sure our road between North
Bennington and this village would
have been a different road during the
summer.
One of the points developed, is that
chains having as many cross links as
is possible to insert In the side chains
will prevent all slip and give a con
stant steady motion to the drag while
affording complete protection to the
tires frcm stono cuts. Using two
chains from the drag to the rear
spring shackles, any desired angle
may be given to tho drag and it will
stay in that position permanently.
Except for dragging long distances
with varying conditions, an attendant
for the drag Is not necessary. It can
be loaded tho required amount with
stone and will take care of itself. The
drag should not he too heavily loaded
except on a road that hus been much
neglected. The load should usually
be placed so that the outer front cor
ner will dig whilo running along the
"The arches of his feet are grad
ually falling, because his muscles pro
vided to hold them up have weakened
by long disuse.
"He scurries around at his work,
gets tired and nerve worn, and thinks
this is physical exercise, whereas his
muscles and joints have been vir
tually Idle."
Mr. Rittenhouse also describes tho
American's "deadly eating habits."
"There is no burden too great for
him to put upon his digestive system.
He would not think of mixing bricks
or scrap iron or gravel with the fuel
for the furnaticp which heats his
house, but ho does not hesitate to fol
low tliis plan in furnishing the fmd
for his body. Ho feeds his stomach
with all soils of tasty junk, much of
which cannot be fully digested, and
which results in the trouble that
comes from autointoxication."
The American treats his heart and
nerves to $1,200,000,000 worth of nic
otine every year, has doubled his cig
arette allowance, ami in the hut two
generations has taken twice as much
coffee. Most of tho 75,000,000 pounds
of drugs ho consumes annually are
without doctors' prescriptions.
"Although the American doesn't
look murderous," said Mr. Ritten
house, "he commits many more mur
ders than any other human being,"
and also loves to commit suicide."

a lame furrow of mud will be left to
freeze in the center of the road.
With cur car owners interested in
this, and a few of them owning a
drag, and a set of suitable chains for
the work, n wondiTful improvement
will bo immediately apparent. Many
an early winter evening, a dozen cars
in from one to two hours, could

Bennington County roads.

teams at a daily cost of lees than two
teams. The truck will more easily
perform with the road drag than a
large pleasure car does, and might
possibly be made to haul two drags
at one time. l'.ennlngton voters
should see that wd have a motor
truck next spring.

JAPAN TO STAND BY ALLIES
Statesmen Smile Over Germany's De
mand for Restoration of Her Colonies
Tokio, Dec. 15. It is said on the
highest authority that Japan will not
entertain thought of peace as long as
restoration of the antebellum status
is In&isted upon by the Berlin govern
ment ns basis of settlement. Japan
will stand by her allies In their de
termination to continue the war until
the main purpose of overthrowing
Prussian militarism Is accomplished.
Japanese statesmen smile when Ger
many's demand for the restoration of
Kino-ehou is not considered a possi
bility In this country, and Kfnochou
was the colony of which Germans
boasted most. Public sentiment li
this country may approve tho return
to China of that portion oT Shantung
now in Japanese bands, provided ar
rangements favorable to Japanese
trade and enterprise can bo made, but
never would approve its again becom
ing a German colony.,'
Japan's puriose In joining in the
war was to drive the German menace
fiom Asia. This represents restribu
tion for the part the Kaiser played in
robbing Japan of the fruits of the war
with China. Japanese are willing
enough to call the account squared,
but this implies tho present 6tatus in
the Orient, not the before-tho-war
status.
For the same reasons Japan will
not consent to the restoration of oth
er German holdings In the Pacific in
the taking of which she was largely
instrumental.
SAFE CONDUCT FOR TARNOW
Newly Appointed Minister From Austria-Hungary.
london, Dec. 15. The Entente
powers have decided to grant safe
conduct to Count Tarnowski von Tar
now, recently appointed Austro-Hun-Parian
Ambassador to the United
States.
Tho Foreign Ollire made this an
nouncement today, saying the Enten
te had decided to grant the safe con
duct in consideration of the repre
sentations made by the American gov
ernment. The American Ambassador
Walter H. Page, has been notltled.
Washington, Dec. 15. The State
Department today had received no re
ply this morning from either England
or France to the three notes sent
about a safo passago for Count Tar
nowski. The first request for safe
passage, which was made by Austri
Hungary and merely transmitted by
tho United States, was refused on tho
ground that the Entente Allies could
grant no favor of any kind to their
enemies. Tho United States then
made representations on its own ac
count, setting forth that as a neutral
state tho United States had an inalien
able? right to a diplomatic representa
tive from Austria.
