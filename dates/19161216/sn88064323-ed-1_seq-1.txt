A GOOD WORD FOR CORN,
A large percentage of the rich,
est land in this country is devoted
to the growing of corn The
most prosperous American farm,
ers are those who spend
considerable time improving the
quality and increasing the yield
of this typically American crop
But when we hear some men say
that corn has ruined certain breed*
of hogs, and other men call atten
tion to the fact that their pork
was {tuaiuced without corn, we
begin rn wonder why corn ever
came to be a three billion bushel
crop, and why the price has gone
to more thau a dollar a bushel.
Corn has reached its present
popularity because it is exceeding
iy well adapted to a big section
aud because it is a wonderfully ef
ticient feed. It is such a good
meat producer that a good many
livestock producers and feeders
got the idea that corn would do
the trick alone, without the neces
sity of any brain work on their
part.
.■^nd that's why a few people
now are ashamed to say that then
meat products were made from
corn.
The trouble is not with corn
It is still the best meat producer
we have. The feeder needs to
know what to feed with it, so hogs
and cattle can make use of even
more corn. It is the greatest
American crop 4ud needs no apo
logy—even when the price is only
half what it is now.— I he Country
Gentleman.
When the hands chap badly and
the skin splits on the finger tips,
every motion is painful. BAL
LARD'S SNOW LINIMENT puts
end to the misery. One or two ap
plications heals ali soreness and re
stores the hands to sound condi
tion. Price 25c, 50c and $1.00 per
bottle.

OLDEST CHRISTMAS
Decorating Houses, Cliurelies
and Streets With Ever
green Popular Since
Dawn of History.
Pei haps Ihe very oldest of al 1
Christmas customs is that of dc
coraling our houses, churches and
(meets with evergreens At the
very dawn of history began the
worship of the trees, oi forest
worship, and the groves were
man's first temples.
Ail our instincts, our passion
about nature, are forest memories,
for forest worship was universal.
In later times to each god some
tree was dedicated: Apollo had
the laurel, Jupiter the oak, aud
Gieece for ages had its sacred
groves.
The forest worshipers could not
worship without giving, because
to worship is to give, and these
boughs and gailauds were the old
est gift* of man. Before he had
learned to shape offerings of his
own rude skill he could briug to
the sacred trees and hang up on
lln-m rlie first flowers and greenery
of spring and ihe peifeot fruit oi
autumn.
These gifts, remember, wen
never, as with us, decorations;
they were sacrifices.
The Romans, with a fine eye for*
beau y, used to garland their tern
pies and homes aud gathering
places and even the big Coliseum
well boughs of gieen aud ropes of
fioweis This pai'icular custom
was received by ihe Christians
wtrh a special sort of approval,
leealbng, as it did, the fact that
our Lord entered Jerusaleui amid
the strewn branches of the multi
j lude.
mistletoe—New York World,
We must not forget the welcome
! aud lovely mistletoe and holly
Indeed, Christmas without them
would not, with us, seem quite
com piete.
Mistletoe was for ages regarded
as sacred by the old British pa
gans—the Druids—and was sur
rounded with great mystery and
.sentiment, little understood by us
It was supposed to possess heal
tug powers and that it could ward
off evil spirits. The reverence
paid to this little parasite seems
to have been restricted to it, only,
when it was found growing on the
sacred oak frees iu the Druids'
groves.
Once every year the Druid high
priest cut it with a golden sickle,
blessed it aud distributed the
sprays among the people, praying
aloud that each one who received
it might receive divine blessings,
of which it was the symbol. Hav
ing received the sprays, the peo
pie hung them above the doors to
propitiate the gods during the
year
The only remaining significance
attached today to the mistletoe is
the idea if a maiden is not kissed
under it on Christmas day she will
go unwed throughout the year
This idea goes so far back into the
|iast that one cannot trace it.
It is because the mistletoe i*
ï are aud not ea«y to get that we
found and brought forward the
holly, wfiieh, Though lovely, is
used only as a substitute for the
HER CE 4 SSIFICATIOX.
Little Mubei has red hair and
comes from Rhode Island. Re
cently on hearing some boys
speaking of some girl as that
"chicken" she immediately want
ed to know what that expression
rneaut. On being told that it was
a very slangy term for a youug
girl, she pondered a while, then
said with a smile: 'Well, if they
call girls chickens, I guess I must
be a Rhode Islaud Red."—Hoi
