MAYSVILLE LOSES
To Lexington la One of the Heat
Flared Oames Ker seen on the
Local Floor Heore S2 to
The basketball game In the audito
rium of the High School between Mays
vllle and a team from Islington High
School waa one of the best games ever
played on the local floor and was
marked with clean playing. The local
boys were outplayed from the very
beginning, although they led the score
at the end of the first half The l.cx
ington team, having had much more
experience and using university tac
tics In their playing proved to be too
much for the locals and they were de
feated by a score of 32 to 22.
The line-up at the opening of the
game was as follows:
Mays ill Lexington
Right Forward
Smoot Shanklin
Left Forward
Everett Thomas
Centre
Wood Riistinn
Right C.uard
Downing nodes
Left Guard
Drowning Fuller
The first half started with a foul
thrown by Smoot for the locals
Shanklin of the visitors followed with
a field goal. Maysville then tied whei
Smoot threw another foul and went
ahead on a third one. nastiau then
threw another field goal for the visi
tors, next five points scored were hy
I Smoot, three fouls and one field. The
visitors then went ulic.nl on tbrtS
Held nnd one foul goal. Smoot then
made another field and also I foul.
The half ended at this point leaving
the score 12 to 11 in the locals favor.
The second half started with a total
of 12 points being scored hy the Lex
ington boys. Maysville made two on
fouls thrown by Smoot. then a field
for Lexington, two more fouls from
Smoot and two field goals by Everett
put Maysville In striking distance of
the Fayette county boys. Hut a field
goal from Hastain, a foul from Thom
as, almost sealed up the game. A
field goal from Wood raised local
hopes again but this was cancelled by
one frqm Rastaln and a few moments
later the timekeepers whistle blew for
the close of the game.
Maysville certainly made a name
fight for the honors of the contest but
fortune did not smile on them. The
game was very clean, and was certain
ly fast and well played.

DAMAGING FIRE
Bwatpi the Horn of Mr. Samuel HM
dleman on Limestone Street at au
V.rj Hour This Morning.
A disastrous fire swept the home of
Mr. Samuel Middleman on Limestone
street this morning at 4 o'clock. The
fire was a very peculiar one and
originated from a defective flue.
The (ire waa discovered by Officei
William Tolle add Mr. H, C. Pollitt I
Mr. l'ollltt was wakened by the smoke
from the fire and leaving his home he
found the fire had made n rapid head
way and while Mr. Tolle turned In an
alarm he awakened the family. The
lire department made a rapid run and
were soon busy extinguishing the blaze i
The house of Mr. Middleman is a
frame and the next residence,
north is brick. The fire had gained a
great headway between the two housen
and It was there that the most iiama?i
was done. The entire front part of the
house on the north side was burned
out and the firemen hud a very difficult
time to get to the blaze. On the sec
ond floor they were compelled to lay
on the floor to the fire.
The family of Mr. Middleman had
very narrow escape from helm; burn
ed, they not awaking until they heard1
the knocks of Mr. Pollitt and Mr. Tolle
Although the fire hail almost reached
the bed of one of the members oi me
family, he did not awaken.
The fire department did a great work
in extinguishing the blare and had it
not been for their quickness in an
swering the alnrm and In getting
ready ( fight the lire the damage
would have been much more.
The damage to the house and to the
furniture will amount to about $2500,
partially covered by insurance. Th"
attic was entirely gutted nnd the north
side of the house will have to be prac
tically r. 'built
If You
Don't despair!
That sum has many possibilities.
Hhere are some things it will buy
A pretty little tea apron of snowy white.
A colored bead necklace to match frock or blouse.
A pretty collar, or two collars, or one collar with a dainty silk tie.
A pair of mercerized stockings, as glossy as silk and far more
serviceable.

ty chainstitched design in white with French blue eyelets.
Muslin pillow slips. 20x2ti Inches, one end embroidered and hem
stitched, Twelve inch doily, linen center, cluny lace edge.
