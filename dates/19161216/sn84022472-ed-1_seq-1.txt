when there was published in this

lation of a letter written by Professor
' i Munsterberg to thevlmperial German
.'Chancellor, Von Bethmann-Hollweg.
The letter j was intercepted in trahsit
toy the British authorities. ,
- Associates of ' the psychologist as
verted that' the letter revealed that
the' writer was attempting to influ
ence American public opinion in favor
of Germany through anonymous con
tiibutions to the press. Munsterberg
clamied that Ms letter had been badly
translated from the German or inteii
" tionally garbled and that he had never
written or said anything in consistent
' with: his position ,at Harvard or his
residence in the United States. Never

Paris, Dec' 16 Hailing General Nieville as the man of
the hour, Paris today is celebrating his crushing victory over
the Germans on the Meuse battle line yesterday. The news
of the great success, attained by the French forces comes as
a welcome relief to the gloomy tidings from Rumania and the
city is jubilant. V , ' . ,
The big drive which swept the Ger
mans back along a six mile front was
General tyieville's last act before as
suming full 1 command of the French
armies on the western front. His
latest achievemet stamps him as
highly qualified for his new com
mand, Paris believes. .
. The Germans were driven back to
within a "short distance of wjiere their
lines-stood at the opening of their
Verdun drive.
Since his great stroke when the
blood soaked ruins of Port Vaux and
Douaumont fell once more into the
hands of Verdun's defenders, General
Neiville has quietly been preparing to
push his advantage by an attackon a
larger scale. Men and guns had been
assembled and practically everything
was in readiness for the V moment
when the, general should see his op
portunity. Then. the blow fell like a
thunderbolt. . 1
A terrific artillery preparation flat
tened tthe perman defenses, then the
guns were elevated and. threw a cur
tain of steel behind which every
trench - from 1 Pepper. Hill to, beyond
Damloup dashed forward on an
enemy still stunned by the bombard
ment. : :-
In places the Germans gallantly
strove to hold their own but General
Kieville's : dispositions were so ' well
made that tbey were powerless to
stem, even-momentarily, the tide. v-
.The number of guns captured from
the Germans, as counted up f.o the
present, is 80, according to the latest
reports' reaching Paris. . '
The attacking - array swarmed into
tfie German trenches. German troops
in these positions surprised by the
suddenness of the attack, offered com
paratively, little resistance.
, In . the village . of Vacherauville,
where the Germans had installed a.
quantity of machine guns, the struggle
was sharp, but none the less short.
More to the - east the French' formal
tions charged -the f slopes of Peuuer
Hill carrying air' before them- Aa
they rushed to the attack the soldiers
cheered, , and from time,- to time the

Director Courtade Gets
(Quartet of Shoyelers Inf
stead of Usual Scores.
. Director of, Public Works Jacob A
Courtade, has kn army, of four extra
men endeavoring to clea'n the snow
from the streets. Usually the dlrec
tor employs 50 or 60 extra men after
each 'snow storm. , This time he says
he hired the first fdur who were also
the only men who appliod for the
wbirk. AU the old regulars who do
this work seem to have steady jobs.
Which, they do iwt caj-e to le;v.ve tot
the extra work of shoveling snow. .
The street cleanerj are bejng em
jjloyed today in clewing 'crossings .in
the streets where thes . are legularlv
employed. No attempt has been!
made to clear eVen Main street of the
snow. He thinks the snow fall light
enough tfr 5ar speedily cleared away,
by the salt, breezes from the Sound
and the shifting temperature whicVi
prevails in Connecticut coast places.
Should a big storm come lajer, Direc
tor Courtade will marshal his white
Wings with the chasses of the sprink
ling trucks provided with dump cart
bodies and make an attempt to elua.n
up the main business streets at least.
Last year snows . of three storms
were . piled over each other along
State street. North and South Main!
and" East Main streets before the di
rector's men got on the job.
The department is also hard up for
funds for street cleaning, which in-:
dude's snow removal, Vnd more money
must be found before the end of this
fiscal year. The board of apportion
ment appropriated $70,000' for street
cleaning for ' the fiscal year of 1915
and of this only $15,000 is left. There
are so many new hard paved streets
to be cleaned that the money goes
rapidly. The disbursements for this
purpose average $2,000 perweok so
that there will not be money enough
to tide the department until April 1,
1917, when the next appropriation
will be available. In . the meantime
Director Courtade must ask the tax
board f or more money or ele cut
down expenses. . "

along a . small ravine running from

SUITOR'S STORY
SAYS WAITRESS):
Mrs. Patterson Denies
Swain's Love for Her Ran
the Bounds He Tells of.
Mrs. Harriet. Patterson, a prepos
sessing waitress in the Plaza lunch is
hot adverse apparently " to receiving
the attentions, of the opposite sex, but
when they threaten to kill her if she
doesn't leave her husband, and fall so
violently in love with her that they
desire to elope,' she appeals to the
protecting arm of the law for help.
' William Smedley, who came to this
city with Garfield Carson, - who drop
ped' dead in a street car two days ago,
fell in love with Mrs. Patterson at first
sight. v He hired a room at 626 Main
street and proceeded to press his suit.
According to his testimony 'he de
scended to servile depths to win her
love, , building 'the fire in her home,
760 'Broad street,": to prove what! an
obliging affinity he could be when oc
casion demanded. , . He testified that
while she was walking wtth her hus
band one day on the street, Mrs. Pat
terson left her better half ( to cross
the street and maJce an engagement
With the" defendant. - ' s ..
The germs of affection increased so
rapidly in Smedley's system that, he
got up in the morning at 6:30 to meet
her outside her house as she started
on her way to work in the restaurant
at 659 Broad street.
According to her f these sunrise
meetings eventually ended . with his
telling her, "If I can't have you no
one else will." In the afternoon when
she left her employment Smedley
would be right on the job, calling at
her house and he testified, visiting her
in her room. ,
, But she wearied of this. She says,
sn begged of Smedley, in view of the
fact that she was married to stay
away from, her a The suitor however
was deaf to her entreaties and, ' she
says, wound up by threatening to kill
her, producing a gun to prove his sin
cerity, she testified.
The police were appealed to yester
day by Mrs. Patterson . and her hus
band, frho is an employe of the Rem
ington Arms Co- Smedley was arrest
ed on a breach of . the peace . charge.
In court this morning he maintained
that Mrs. Patterson intended leaving
her husband," and he denied he
threatened to kill '.her. , ,
After Smedley had testified she was
recalled to the stand, denying he had
ever been -to : her room, or that she
intended leaving her husband, com
menting on the defendant's testimony
as "mostly lies," and- she looked
Smedley square in the eye and . re
marked, "You said you would blow
my head off." .; ,
' In passing Judgment Judge ""Wilder
said ' if he thought Smedley had
threatened the woman's life he would
srive lhlm sis months, A suspended
sentence of 30 days was imposed.

of $5,000 from the city to be devoted
to the assistance of needy tuberculo

An investigation by the department
shows that consumptives after leav

forced, to return to institutions owing
to the fact that because of misfortune
they are unable to obtain proper food
and living conditions.
Efforts will also be made to obtain

Committee to Tell .
What It Has Done
Attorney William A. Redden and

causer why f they t should .not be" ex
cused:as a special committee to codify
and .arrange . the city charter, which
was adopted in 1907. The resolution
which Alderman Oliver C. Cole of' the
Eleventh district presented at, the last
meeting of the council and which was
adopted by that "body 'with dissent,;
does noKxactly specify what the al-
dermeir have in "mind, but unless the"
attorneys can' show-some good reason
for. not carrying out the work, the
former-action ,of the council will be
rescinded and.- a new committee ap
pointed. ; . ; .
As yet they have not' received a cent
for. their services if, any have been
performed. Each year $2,000 has
been appropriated for the work, but
before the -fiscal year has . ended it
has been' applied to, some other pur
pose. - This year it was added to make
up-the deficit in the health board bud
get caused by the added expense of
the campaign against infantile par
alysis.. ... .
Attorneys ReddeA and Meltzer say
that a number of changes have taken
place in the charr since it. was
adopted and in spite of this fact the
old charter would have been codified
and ready at this time but for the ag
itation over the" commission ..form of
government- charter which necessarily
halted their ' work until . it could be
ascertained whether or not' the new
