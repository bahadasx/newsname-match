COMMISSION HAS
FAILED ASSERTS
REPRESENTATIVE
Greer County Legislator Would
Abolish System,
WOULD INCREASE COURT
Dockets Have Not Been Re
lieved, He Says.
Taking the position that thr supreme
court commission of Oklahoma has
failed of its object in clearing the
crowded docket, Representative J. 0.
McCollister of Mangum advocates the
abolition of the commission and an in
crease in the number of supreme
judges.
Should Condemn Land.
Representative McCollister, referring
to the subject of good roads, says that
a law is needed whereby lands can be
condemned for right-of-way the same
as in the building of railroads.
"The width of the roads should be
cut down." declares the representative.
"Automobile taxes ought to be fig
ured on a quarterly basis; it is not just
for a man to buy a car in December
nd have to pay the tax for the whole
year."
Letter Received.
Mr. MrCollister's letter dealing with
matters of moment that he says should
he considered by. the next legislature
Is as follows :
"Good roads enthusiasm is rampant
now and matters have come up that
need new legislation. One thing in our
locality, we ate building good roads
and have a fine bed of gravel on a
farm adjoining the road, but the owner
of the land will not sell the land at all
nd wants a big price for the gravel,
knowing he has the only gravet handy.
We think there should be a law to
condemn this Jand the same as can be
done in building a railroad.
Should Cut Width.
"The width of roads should be cut
down, unless there is ome real neces
sity in places of more land. Automo
bile taxes ought to be figured on a
quarterly basis. It w not just for a
man I buy a car in December and
have to pay the tax for the whole
year.
"I think the supreme court commis
sion has failed of its object in clear
ing the docket, put above all, the con
flicting opimoui that have been hand
ed down on account' of the-different
divisions of the court jiving one de
cision and another division some other
decision, and, on account of lack of
time, the supreme court has approved
both decision when they were dia
metrically opposed. This is not right
and a condition that would allow such
a thing ought not to stand any longer
than is necessary to get a new law
Increase Court
"If the legislature can legally do so,
it ought to increase the number of sir
preme judges and do away with the
commission entirely and in this way
we would probably secure a higher
class of judges, even if the salaries
were raised some to secure them.
"I think, also, all, or at least a part,
of the sfhool monies used building the
State1 capitol should be paid back to the
consolidated districts and I shall either
support or introduce a bill to that ef-
"A few minor amendments to the tax
laws and fee system I have in mind, but
not of any vital Importance. I sha.ll
father endeavor to support bills intro
duced by other members that meet my
approval, then try to introduce so many
myself."
Mr. McCollister was a member of
the legislature two years ago. t was
re-elected in November.

Military Officer Says

Slavs
BERLIN, Dec. 16.-A military offi
cial who is frankly and keenly hopeful
that some way may be found to end the
war, though he is none too optimistic at
the present, today called representatives
of the neutral press to inquire as to he
probable effect of the German peace
note in neutral countries. He laid great
stress upon this point and particularly
whether there probably would be any
tendency to construe the German note
as a sign of weakness.
Prepared for Spring Attacks.
Discussing the possibility that all
peace propositions may be rejected at
present, this officer declared Germany
was aware the F'rench and British
would make another herculean effort in
the west next spring an effort for
which Germany would be fully pre
pared. He expressed the opinion that it
could not have any result other than
continued slaughter and that it would
have no more prospects of success than
the Somme offensive.
Will Squeese Russia.
In the meantime this officer con
tinued, Germany would not give Rus
sia time to recuperate as happened a
year ago. He said Germany was in a
position today to force Russia to nuke
peace, and that she surely would do so
if the peace overtures were rejected. He
asserted Russia was known by Ger
many to be exhausted in a military and
economical sense, having neither trade,
troops njir ammunition. On the word
of Hinclrnbiirg that there would he no

peace proposals of the central powers,
to discuss the general subject of peace
from this government's viewpoint and
to give any information Mr, -ansin
might desire from the German govern
ment. No Terms Discussed.
Ambassador Bernstorff said after a
ten-minute visit with Secretary Ian

"We die) not discuss peace terms in
any way. I have not received any formal
terms and the American government
knows officially that no formal terms
have been placed. The government has
suggested that the belligerents get to

tary was purely for general discussion."
Place Up to Allies.
The ambassador uulicated that the
actual place for the bidding of a con
ference and the question of whether i'
should be by direct negotiations or
through intermediaries, were nucstinns
entirely dependent upon the willingncKS
of the entente allies to discuss the sit

had not discussed the American action
