attravted profound attention in

: Secretary Lan-ing, explaining the
delay in transmitting the communica

out that the Herman note was trans

by Ambassador I'entiehl. at Vienna;
while the Turkish note came to the
^tat ? department in French. As the

identical, the Stale Department does
not desire to transmit three different
