Blow Falls on the German
Troops in Verdun Region
Like a Thunderbolt.
< ?v AtSOClATtO PntSlT!
T'A'IIS, Dec:. 15.- The number of
guns captured from the Germans in
General Nivellc's victory on the Verlun
front as -counted up to the present
time is eighty, according to the latest
reports reaching here.
N As his last act before assuming the
chief command of the French armies
on the western front. General Nivelle
smashed the German line east of the
Meuse along a front, of six miles. The
victory has advanced the French positions
two miles and they are now
within a short distance of where the
Germans stood at the outset of the
great Verdun drive. The military authorities
describe the victory as comnlett*
nnrl rriKbinc
~ CT *
Since his last great stroke, when
he blood-soaked ruins of Forts Vaux
and DouT' ont fell once more into the
Mantis of Verdun's defenders. General
XivelJe has been quietly preparing to
push Ins advantage by an attack on a
larger scale. Men and guns had been
shielded, shells piled, and everything
was in readine s for the moment when
the general should see 'tis opportunity.
Then the blow fell ] ke a thunderbolt.
A terrific artillery bombardment
flattened the German defenses
and the guns were elevated and threw
a curtain of steel, behind which the
infantry from every trench from Pepper
hiil to beyond Paniloupe dashed
forward on an enemy still stunned to
the bombardment.
In places the Germans gallantly
strove to hold their ground but General
F'Velio's dispositions were so
well made that they were powerless
to stem, even momentarily, the tide.
One after another Vacherauville and
Louver, ont villages. Chambrctte farm
and the Haudremont and Besonyaux
works fell without the defenders having
time to carry away either guns or
material, and prisoners began to
stream steadily rearward to pens prepared
for their reception .
The weather, according to hitherto
accepted notione, was all against?
the offensive. It was wet and misty
and the French officers believe that
this fact undoubtedly led the Germaus
io miscalculate the probabilities of attack.
The wretched weather did not
prevent the aviators from rendering
valuable aid to the attack. The
large number of prisoners, according
to latest advices, nearly 9,000. is an
indication of the surprise nature of
the onset.
The news of the victory was received
in Paris with enthusiasm as a
welcome relief to the gloomy tidings
from Roumanla. General Nivclle is
the man of the hour. His latest
achievement justifies, it is felt, his
choice as commander-in-chief andj
augers well for the future. 1
The French plan of attack ' was.,
drawn up by General Nivelle with the,
concurrence of General Petain, who,
at the time was his superior officer.'
The assault proper was left to Gen-i
oral Mangin. It was made by five
divisions or close to 100.000 men.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.?Count
von Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
conferred "with Secretary Lansing
today, seeking Information of the
attitude of the United States toward
the peace proposals of the Central
powers, to discuss the general subject
of peace of this government's viewpoint,
and to give any information
Mr. Lansing might desire on the attitude
or the German government.
Ambassador Bernstorff said, after a
ten-minute visit with Secretary Lansing:
"We did not discuss peace terms In
any way. I have not received any
formal terms, and the American government
knows officially that no formal
terms have been proposed. All
Germany has suggested is that the
belligerents get together and talk. If
that proposal is accepted definite
fer-v-s naturally will be discussed but
until then It will not' be proper to
mention them. My visit to the secretary
was purely for general dismssion."
