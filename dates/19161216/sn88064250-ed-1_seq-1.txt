OPENING PRAYER
"Almighty and everlasting
God, Designer of all our works
and ways, Thou who didst lead
the Children of Israel, dry shod,
through the Red Sea, and Who
didst show to the three Magi,
from far off lands, the way to
Thee in Bethelem, guiding them
by the brilliancy of a star, grant,
to us, Thy servants, we beseech
Thee, a prosperous way, and a
peaceful time, so that we, under
the guidance of Thy Holy Angles,
may come to all those determina
tions, which we so much wish,
and that finally we might joyous
ly reach the portals of eternal
salvation.
"0 God, Who didst lead Abra
ham, Thy Son, out of Chaldea,
through all the vicissitudes of
life, and. Who didst bring Elias,
Thy servant, to the Holy Mount,
we beseech that Thou wouldst
deign to watch over us in all
these proceedingsm and grant to
us light so. to choose a right path,
that being guided by Thy Holy
Counsel here below, we may nev
er be turned away from the way
that leads to Thee.
"Grant to our great Chieftain,
whom Thou hadst deigned so re
cently to again set over Thy peo
ple, Thy. Holy Spirit, so that he,
under Thy holy guidance, may
direct this Great Nation in the
paths of righteousness and jus
tice. Keep us from bloody strife
and make us a Nation fraught
with fraternal love."
Secretary J. G. Lawler of Ope
lousas was at his desk and ably
performed the duties incumbeit
on him, while Father Grace Iand
led the gavel in becoming style,
notwithstanding the fact that he
had been painfully injured in an
automobile accident last Tues
day while returning from Lafa
yette to his residence in. Grand
Coteau.
The delegation from Bunkie
was headed by C. J. Pope and his
address to the meting was an able
exposition of the great good the
building of the proposed highway
would be to this entire section of
the country. Mr. Pope has the
matter at his fingers' ends and
his words were listened to with
approval and he was frequently
interrupted by applause of the
laige assemblage. He has taken
a most prominent part in the
formation of the highway asso
ciation and is not letting any
thing interfere with the fruition
of the plan of building this gerat
road from the Jefferson High
way at Bunkie to the Spanish
Trail Highway at Lafayette.
Hon. John W. Lewis of Ope
lousas,. who followed Mr. Pope,
delivered a 'most eloquent ad
dress, touching upon the bene
ficial influences to be derived
from the Eonstruction of modern
good roads, telling the assem
blage how easily it could be done
and how it would pay splendid
dividends to our children and our
children's children for genera
tions. lie pledged his efforts to-.
wards the building of , the
Evangeline Highway and stated
in most (,mphatie terms that he,
would vote for the proposed tax
to construct it. His address was
punctuated with loud and fre
quent applause, denoting that his
remarks struck an aye-responsive
cord in the hearts of his listen
S"eS.
Hon. E. B. Dubuisson of One
lon sa followed Mr. Lewis and
hir address was mainly devoted
to the financial and leal a hasesI
n.f the matter. He stressed na'1-I
+;eularlv an the t.at, v-' lb-j
wrn sf i11 nrd nrta ;,t the finberf.,
Swards aln stated that, a number
of years ago, the people. of Ope
lousas and of the first ward voted
taxes and gave a bonus for the
coustruction of two railroads;
thht these rail lines had been
built but were owned by private
coiporations and that if the peo
pl here could well afford to vote
taxes, for railroad construction,
the railroads to belong to out
side parties, they could better af
ford to vote taxes for the con
striietion of modern highways
the title of which would vest in
thldm. their children and their
children's children. Mr. Dubuis
son was most emphatic and en
thusiastic in his approval of the
building of the highway and indi
cated that he would devote much
of his time to the futherance of
the plan.
The me'eting, then adjourned
until 1:15 p. m., the afternoon
session being devoted primarily
to devising ways and means of
making the association a going
concern, and to that end it .was
decided to form a road district
to be composed of the first, sec
ond and 'fifth police jury wards,
through which the highway will
run.
It was also brought out that the
assessed valuation of' the prop
erty in these wards subject to
taxation, including non-residents
and railroads, was approximately
$5,000,000 and that a five-mill tax
on this valuation will enable the
district to issue bonds' to the
amount of $500,000, of which sum
it is estimated that $300,00)
woild be sufficient to build a
sta.dard highway the entire
length through the parish, in
cluding concrete and permanent
bridges, thus leaving some $200,
000 to build lateral roads -in each
of the three wards leading to the
main highway.
Apropos of this latter, it was
suggested by some present at the
meeting that a lateral rood could
be built in the fifth ward from
Washington through Grand Pra
irie to the parish line; another
from Begg, along the old "state
road," to the ward line at Bayou
Waxia; another from Dubuisson,
along the road to Morrow, to the
ward line, also at Bayou Waxia;,
another from Opelousas to De-1
baillon's bridge, and perhaps
from Devillier's corner, on the
gravel road leading to Port Barre
to the ward line near Leonville ;
and also another road through
Sunset and Grand Coteau, east
and west across the second ward.
A committee composed of Fath
er Grace- as chairman, with J. G.
Lawler and E. B. Dubuisson, was
appointed to frame by-laws and
report same at the next regular
meeting, which will be held at the
court house in this city on Jan
uary 18, 1917, at 10 a. m.
The ifollowinm committee was
appointed to appear before the
police jury at its next regular
meeting, to be held on Tuesday,
January 2, 1917, and urge before
that body the necessity of calling
a special election in the proposed
road district as to whether a tax
will be voted and bonds issue for
the rbuilding and maintenance of

Dr. Felix Guilbeau, Frank Oli
,vier, and other interested citizens
of that ward.
It is fully expected that the
committee will meet with success
before the police jury and secure
the ordering of an election and
the ,ormal organization of the
road district prayed for and that
a campaign in the interest of the
carrying of the tax election will
be immediately begun and vigor
ously waged. The general meet
ing ca d for January 18 will be
the cu ination of the initial
stages th6 eatiipaign for the
general highway which road, as
stated by Mr. Lewis in his ad
dress, will not be second in im
portance to the big Jefferson
Highway itself. In this connec
tion Mr. Lewis stated 'that tour
ists coming south, on arriving at
Bunkie and noting the signboard
pointing to the Evangeline road
would naturally turn in this di
rection for, as stated, theland of
Evangeline was noted far and
wide and visitors from the north
and west would naturally have. a
curiosity to pass through here on
the Way suoth; and, urther, if
the water in the great 'Atchafa
laya river would,' unhappily,
break through the levees and
place the Jefferson Highway out
of commission, the Evangeline
Highway would, ipso facto, be
come the Jefferson Highway, for
tourists coming south to New Or
leans would be compelled to take
the Evangeline Highway from
Bunkie.
Father Grace and his co-work
ers in this great cause are to be
congratulated on their prelimin
ary success in furthering the con
struction of the proposed high
way. The need of good roads is
apparent-has been apparent for
years, and the building, some
years ago, of gravel roads lead
ing in four directions out of Ope
lousas has emphasized the value
of such highways, which are
Itassable for heavily loaded ve
hicles and automobiles in all
kinds of weather when the dirt
roads are asea of mud. These
gravel roads, above mentioned,
were in the nature of an experi
ment but after several years of
hard usage without the expendi
ture of much money in their
maintenance, they still remain in
good condition and fully able to
stand any and all traffic which
they bear.
The \good roads fever has
struck Louisiana with a venge
atac-e and even the most illiterate
of our population is beginning to
realize the benefits to be derived
from construction of modern
highways. The automobile, once
considered a freak, a curiosity
and an impracticable toy for the
rich, is being purchased in ever
increasing numbers by our peo
ple and when a man buys his first
car it does not take him long to
see the advantage of gravel roads.
Then.' aside from. the pleasure to
be derived from a spin over a
hard-surfaced road in a speeding
auto, the farmer and his team,
with a heavily loaded wagon of
farm produce, quickly notes the
ease with which he gets over the
road and to marketwhen he hits
the p'rPvel stretches.

DELAYS IN PUBLICATION
DUE TO DISORGANIZATION
Rush of Legal Work Last Week
and Changing of Machinery
Caused Lateness of Issue
Last Saturday's issue of The
Clarion was published late. A
rush of legal work-police jury,
city council, school board and
drainage proceedings, along with
other similar matter, and a big
volume of commercial advertis
ing, was the direct cause'of the
lateness of the issue. Besides,
w~ had not then moved the lino
type machine recently purchased
from the Enterprise plant and the
entire typesetting was done int
another building and all by one
man between Tuesday afternoon
and Saturday. It was a herculean
task but accomplished in record
time. This week the linotype
was moved to The Clarion build
ing and, beside from a slight de
lay eaused by the dismounting
and re-erection of the machine,
we are almost on time, and in the
future expect to eliminate all de
lays in publication.

Martin' Vidrine, the youngi

It will be remembered that Vi

wounded that officer by shotting
him in the leg. Both men, follow

the sanitarium and it is reported
that Wallior is recovering rapid

period of ten days, the result of
which brought about the action

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
Street Fair on Court House
Square is a Desecration
As I write these lines there is
being placed upon the court
house square, tents for a street
fair.
This is an outrage and a dese
cration of the one beauty spot in
our midst.
If we are to have street fairs,
let them be held in Mr. Haas' lot
near his garage, or in Mrs. Com
eau's pasture, if these parties
will permit them. 'But under n,
circumstances ought the police
jury to permit them to be held on
the court house square. Dog and
monkey shows and the accom
panying followers of street fairs,
adjoining the temple of justice,
don't fit.
I am voicing thesentiments of
every gentlemen I have met this
a. m., when I assert that this
square should not be devoted to
any, such vile and rude abuse.
Yours truly,
