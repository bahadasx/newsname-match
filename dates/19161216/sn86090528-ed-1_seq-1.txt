today following a visit of Count von

,i Secretary of State Lansing. The

know officially what these terms are.
At the pame time Germany will also

While Count von BeniHtorff refused
to talk about this government's plans,
it is known that the German authori

believe that President Wilson has left
a way open to act later on.

Student Body Will See That St. Nicholas
Brings Presents to About Seventy
Five Poor Children
For several years it has been the
custom for the Athletic association of
the College to give a Christmas party
just before the holidays. It has been
the custom to have a tree and for each
Athletic association member to put
one pres. ;nt on the tree for some oth
er member. A great, deal of fun has
been derived from this, but this year
the Young Women's Christian associa
tion has taken this in hand and has
changed the Christinas party for them
selves to a Christmas tree and Santa
Clause for a
number of littfe children
of Chkka -d-.a.
There are about seven-.;

We tiske our teachers to stress the
it iporfuuce of regular .ittendaueo and
punctuality in all the schools. As will
he si en, the west school has a most
eAcellent record for this month, with
a close second by tho north school and
third by the .south school. The per
centago of all the schools show a om
r.iendable record on attendance. It is
tiai'e to say that ninety per cent of
these ilelinmienries of attendance and
punctuality are, without good excu e.
They are faults which contribute very
ti eth to. demoralize 'the pupils' class
work right character forming as he
passes thru school. Parents and chil
dren should realize that stdiool is a
business and business principles must
prevail in order to get satisfactory re
sults. All the schools will close for the hol
idays on December 22nd and open on
Monday, the second day of January.
Mr. J. W. Owsley has kindly placed
good clock in. the hallway of the
junior high school. This favor is
greatly appreciated by tho teachers
and pupils. It is rumored that anoth
er friend of the school will place a
clock in tho auditorium of the junior.
This school is in need of a flag and
would assemble at any convenient
hour in the auditorium to accept one
from any kind friend.

County Ags.it Preparing Annual Report to
Be Transmitted to Department of Ag

At the meeting' of the directors of
the ConimiT.d;rl and Farm bureau Fri
day evening, a representative of tho
Bidpath Lyceum bureau presented a
proposition to give Chickasha a six
thly:;' Chautauqua during the month of
June, im'ii'ding two high class attrac
tions each day. The program would
consist of lectures, musical number:!
and various forms of entertainments.
Among the lecturers would be Pr.
Itr.Klford, , former chancellor of Ki
n-orth university, and Senator Heleb
Bitig Robinson, of Colorado.
Season tickets for the entire course
would bo sold for, $2. The' lyeeum
cr,n,rany would furnish a large tent
auditorium and all the advertising
n ntt.er. Local people would bo requir- '
cd to furnish seats urd a piano ant! to
sell at least 2:0 season tickets on
which, they weald receive a commis
sion of IT, per cent.
The bureau directors were favorable
to the proposition but were inclined to
the view that If, should be handled by
some other organization. L. C. Hut-
Won. W. Ii. imnanue, F. L. .blusher
and W. W. Clark were appointed as a
committee to take the matter up with
'he churches and clubs of the city.
i Final action will be decided upon be
fore ,ncxt Wednesday when the Rid
path representative Is expected to re
turn. The faet that the term of office
of the, present board of directors ex
pires the first of April rendered them
less disposed to act on the proposi
tion. The usual routine business was han
dled by the board, including reports
from County Agent Cooper anr Secre
tary Clark. Mr. Cooper stated that he
was preparing his annual report; to the
department of agriculture and would
soon ' have it finished.
Mrs. Coryell, who has been reinstat
ed as woman agent for the comity, was
i given desk room in the bureau head
quarters.' ' '
President Cook proposed a plan for
taking the census of the city in Jan
uary and was authorized to proceed
with it. Ho plans to enlist the ef
forts of die high school students, di
