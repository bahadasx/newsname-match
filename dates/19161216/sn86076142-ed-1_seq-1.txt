BROTHERHOODS GET TOGETHER
WITH THE RAILROAD MANAGERS
LLOYD GEORGE MAY
NOT APPEAR TUESDAY
(Br Associated Praia.)
EVANSVILLE, Ind., Dec. J6. W. 0. .
Lee of Cleveland, president of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen,
publicly announced here today for
the first time that negotiations are
under way between the leaders of the
brotherhoods and those higher up in
the chambers of the operating depart
ments "of the railroads looking to a
settlement of their entire contro
versy out of court before January 1,
when the Adamson law Is scheduled
to go into effect. He said the settle
ment was In a crude state as yet.
. Mr. Lee made the statement in the
course of an address before the Cen
tral States Conference on Water and
Rail Transportation, which closed Its
sessions.
"I know I am not betraying con
, Sdences," he said, "when I say some
of the very best brains high up in
the chambers of the operating de
partments of the railroads favor

something satisfactory to both sides,
and they have discussed it with us.
I left them only Wednesday night in
New York and will be back there
very soon. We hope to work it out.
We know that if we don't work it
out for ourselves, the employes and
employers, somebody 1b going to
work It out for us, and it will not be
acceptable to either side.
"We know that for 25 years these
organizations have dealt across the
table in the most friendly spirit, and
we believe there is sufficient intel
ligence on both sides of the table to
enable us to get together, man-like,
and thresh these things out and
reach middle ground.
Mr. Lee predicted that if the pres
ent negotiations come to a successful
end the disputes between the em
ployes and the railroads will be taken
out of politics by the establishment
of some kind of a federal commis
sion to take the place of the present
board . of' mediation and conciliation.
He said the members of this pro
posed board should be practical men
from both sides, appointed by the
government and .answerable to the
president, with full authority to bear
and disitose of all controversies that
arise. He said that a board com
posed of four' brotherhood men and
four railroad representatives, cut
loose from the organizations and
from their, railroad interests, would
form a commission, to the fairness
of which he would be willing to
subscribe. '
"With a commission on this order,"
he said, "It is my opinion that 90 per
cent of all so-called grievances that
will be settled satisfactorily."
Mr. Lee sald it' was the hope of
the brotherhoods to effect a settle
ment outside and independently of
the provision of the Adamson law.
He intimated that the railroad lead
ers also share this hope. .

LONDON, Dec. 16. "Confident that

then I know you will" (Here the
emperor, says the correspondent,
made a warlike gesture which pro

The newspaper dispatch describes
how the troops were drawn up in
parade order, a number of aeroplanes
being In readiness to ward off a pos

accompanied by the crown .prince and
General von Gundel, the commander
of the army corps. '
After inspecting the troops, the em

for protecting that region.

notes of the central powers proposing
a discussion of peace to the entente
allies will be sent forward by the
American government, acting as in
termediary without any accompany

has not determined whether any ac

later by the United States on its
own account, but is holding himself
in readiness to serve In any way
possible towards bringing the war
ring nations together.
Count von Bernstorff called today
and said he had not discussed peace
terms with Lansing. "All Germany
suggested was that the belligerents
get together tor a talk and, it they
accepted definitely, terms would natu
rally be discussed." ,
The delay in forwarding the notes
to the entente capitals was due to
the fact that the messages received
from Germany, Austria-Hungary and
Turkey, identical in .substance, dif
fered slightly in phraseology as a
result of different translations.
