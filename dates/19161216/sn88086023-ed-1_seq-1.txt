LONDON. Dec. 13. The long de
layed settlement of the Irish question
Is near. An amicable union of Ul
sterites and southern Irishmen Is vis
ible. Lloyd George's negotiations
started following the Dublui revolt
at first nppeared a failure but they
are steadily progressing and have
reached the stage where definite
agreement is expected daily.
The Irish did not seriously object
to Sir Edward Carson's appointment
to the new cabinet. The Irish strong
ly objected when Carson was first
included In Asquith's cabinet. There
was no criticism over Lloyd George
retaining Henry Edward Duke as
chief secretary for Ireland. Lloyd
George's action Is undoubtedly the
result of Duke's efforts to reunite
Ireland.
