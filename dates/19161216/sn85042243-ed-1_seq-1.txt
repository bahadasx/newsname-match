AGAIN DENIE8 AUTHORITY
OF PROVISIONAL JURISTS
Declares Supreme Court Justices
Have No Right to Impro­
vise Tribunal
An unexpected development in the
supreme court squabble came today,
when State Auditor Carl Jorgenson
was formally served by Justice-elect
J. E. Robinson with a notice warning
him that he would be held legally re­
sponsible should he recognize any
warrants for December salary pre­
sented by the retiring supreme court
justices.
Writing on a letter-head bearing the
caption, "Supreme Court, State of
'North Dakota. Motto: Let Justice
Prevail," and superscribing himself
as Associate Justice James E. Robin­
son, Office for Years Commenc­
ing December 4, 1916," the justice
elect says:
Mr. Carl O. Jorgenson, State Auditor,
iBismarck, X. D.
Dear Sir: 1 am sending you a copy
of my certificate of election as su­
preme court judge, showing that I
have been elected to that office for
six years, commencing on December
4, 1916, and, as Judges Charles J.
Fisk, E. T. (Burke and E. B. Goss are
holding over contrary to the law and
the constitution, and their certificates
of election, you are cautioned against
paying them any salary or giving
them a warrant for any salary for the
month of December. 1316. !f you
should give them a warrant for the
December salary, it will put the state
to the trouble and expense of bringing
a suit against you and against them
to recover the same. You may please
see in the office of secretary of state
copies of the certificates of election
under which the said Ju(Jg-.s Fisk,
Burke and Goss hold office and they
will show you that at the general elec­
tion November 8, 1910, thoy .vore
elected judges-.of the supreme court
to hold office for six years, commenc­
ing on the first Monday in December,
1910.
The Improvised Court.
You may have read that in some
way they improvised a court to sus­
tain the claim that they have a right
to hold office until January the firs*,
but if you will think for a moment it
will be entirely clear to you 'hat fhe
The supreme court judges have no
right or authority to make a court.
»nd as judge of the supreme court,
I claim the salary for the month of
December, 1916. and feel sure the
state will pay it.
Of course. I am interested only as a
citizen. My rights are in no way af­
fected by any warrants or moneys
you choose to give out to any person.
J. E. ROBINSON.
Jorgenson tr Consult Linde.
State Auditor Jorgenson stated this
morning, shortly after the above com­
munication had reached him through
the mails that he would confer with
Attorney General Linde before issu­
ing or refusing to issue warrants to
the retiring justices or the justices
elect.

Partly Cloudy Tonight and Cold­

With Chicago shivering in a cold
wave which is sweeping the shores
of Lake Michigan, a coal famine in
sight and coal experts there estimat­
ing that the coal supply cannot hold
out 10 more days because of the car
shortage, Bismarck is enjoying a tem­
perature which at its lowest last night
was 30 above and at noon today 21.
Why Go South for Winter.
Why go south for the winter? El
Paso, Tex., reputed for its mild tem­
peratures during the winter, reported
28 degrees last night, two degrees
colder than it was in Bisamrck. Then
just take a trip down to tl%» Gulf of
Mexico to Galveston, where the mini­
mum for the night was 32 degrees,
just defeating Bismarck by two
rounds. Up at Winnijeg, the coldest
city on the weather map, the tempera­
ture was 12 below and in the land of
the Hudson bay, Prince Albert chalk­
ed a temperature of six below as the
official reading from the city at the
head of the Saskatchewan.
Crissey Story is Hit.
In his replies to criticisms made to
his article in the Saturday Evening
Post, entitled "The Hired Man—His
Kick," iForrest Crissey set forth the
fact that on November 13, 1916, the
temperature in Chicago was mild and
balmy while poor old Bismarck was
in the throes of the l)ld king with a
minimum temperature of four de­
grees below zero.
However, the tables have turned.
Crissey might be indicted on a true
bill by residents of North Dakota.
According to the official reading made
by Forecaster Roberts of the govern­
ment weather observatory here, the
minimum last night was 30 degrees
above and at Chicago it was zero.
Lower Temperature Tonight.
Generally settled weather condi­
tions prevail over, the northwest with
a heavy snowfall being reported from
most of the cities, Bismarck's precipi­
tation amounting to .26 of an inch.
It has promoted Christmas cheer and
resulted in a big business today for
the footwear dealer. The low tem­
perature which caused such unsettled
weather during the past 24 hours was
moving slowly eastward and is over
Manitoba this afternoon, also Minne­
sota. Higher pressure follows and
will result in partly cloudy weather
tonight and Sunday with lower tem­
perature tonight.

A bill granting the state of North

has been introduced in the United
States senate by Senator A. J. Gron­

there is good reason to expect that
it will be reported favorably.
The bill provides that the lands so
appropriated shall be sold at public

to constitute a permanent fund, from
which only the interest shall be ex
pended for the maintenance and sup­

Congress, which now is giving fa­

bill appropriating $:n,00u Tor im­
provements to the Indian school build­
ings, and which during the last ses­
sion appropriated $35,000' for a new
boys' dormitory, now is ready, Repre­
sentative George M. Young advises
the Commercial club to consider the
improvement of the road leading from
Bismarck to the school.
This is Bismarck's so-callel "river
road," on whose improvement the riv­
er crossing committees of the Man
dan and Bismarck commercial clubs
recently concentrated their attention.
Bismarck long has suffered in silence
the inconveniences and dangers of
this highway, but inspectors of the
department of the interior who have
traveled over it do not regard the
thoroughfare suitable for the use of
Uncle Sam's little redskin wards, and
what Bismarck has failed to do may
be done by a federal appropriation.
The result would be a mile of model
roadway, paved probably with con­
crete or tar macadam. Uncle Sam,
however, will not consider building
this highway on mooted right-of-way
and the Commercial club, while Rep­
resentative Young is looking after the
Washington end of the undertaking,
will seek to have dedicated a public
highway, properly laid out and in such
a location as may best meet the Unit­
ed States Indian bureau's approval.
Action on the part of the city com­
mission is expected as soon as City
Engineer Atkinson can make a sur­
vey and draw up plans and specifica­
tions for the construction of the read
to the ferry landing.
It is hoped that something tangible
will come before the commission in
the near future. Sentiment is strong­
ly in favor of improving conditions.
TTiose working for the completion of
such a road want it in shape when

on Opening
New York, Dec. 16.—The stock mar­
ket rebounded from the four day
break caused by the German peace
proposal. Initial gains were made,
ranging as high as five points in some
instances.
United States Steel opened with a
sale of 25,000 shares, selling 114 to
114International Paper jumped
five points, w{h Lackawanna Steel
up three, and there were gains of two
points or more in the general list.
News from Petrograd that the
duma had gone on record as against
the acceptance of Germany's peace
proposal brought new heart to the
sagging confidence of "war brides"
speculators. The result was that
trading became active. Crucible
Steel led the "war bride" group since
Bethlehem Steel reached such dizzy
heighths, and opened 69 up.
Lackawanna Steel, which has large
Russian orders, opened 91, a substan­
tial advance. Mining shares, oil and
other issues joined in the general re­
covery.
During the first hour nearly half a
million shares were traded in. The
opening strength was not entirely
maintained by steel. After selling at
114%, it dropped back to 11:!%.
Today's gains were not all main­
tained at the close, but the market
was steady and prices* generally were
one to four points higher than yester­
day. During two Jhours 87^MM0 shares
were solSTthe week's total amounting
to approximately 11,000,000 shares.
United States Steel closed at 114%,
up two points. The bears launched a
drive on the market and prices jump­
ed during the first hour, but were
driven to cover during the final trad­
ing. Railways were particularly
strong.
Soars & Roebuck made a spectacu­
lar jump of 6%' during the late trad­
ing, selling at 130. Crucible Steel
closed at 68%, up one point. Baldwin

Germany's
Peace Plea
Only Truce
Washington Correspondent of
Tribune Discusses Proposals
From Allies' Viewpoint
WHAT ABOUT PRINCIPLES
INVOLVED IN STRUGGLE
Russia and Japan Would Stand
To Lose Heavily if Teuton
Terms Are Adopted
EDITOR'S NOTE—We are pre
senting peace proposals from the
'Allies' standpoint. Later they
will be discussed from the Teu­
tonic angle.
By STAFF CORRESPONDENT.
Washington, Dec. 16.—Germany's
peace proposal is a stroke of policy
bold enough and clever enough to
take the breath of anybody that stud­
ies the real European situation.
With extraordinary adroitness she
offers terms and frames them that in
America and the other neutral coun­
tries millions of persons will here­
after put upon the Allies all the blame
for continuing the war.
Germany offered to make peace, of­
fered to restore Belgium, about which
you make such a fuss, offered to evac­
uate northern France. The practical
value of such a play is beyond calcu­
lation. In the United States, for in­
stance, it hits the right moment ex­
actly between the eyes.
Yet there are at least six mighty
good reasons why the Allies cannot
possibly agree to any such terms—or
good, at least, from their point of
view.
Allies' Viewpoi.t
(1) Serbia—To surrender her to
Austria would mean that Austria gets
away with her monstrous and intoler­
able demands, which precipitated the
war. That would seal the fate of
every small nation on earth. It would
mean that no small nation had a sin­
gle right any great nation was bound
to respect. There would lie no code
of morals between a big nation and a
small nation except the code of the
stronger arm and the longer reach.
(2) Russia—She would have to be
cold-bloodedly abandoned by her al­
lies to bear a loss of territory they
escaped and to give up forever her
fondest hope of centuries—Constanti­
nople, the warm water outlet, lack of
which has kept her in the list of back­
ward nations, thereby dooming her
people to autocratic rule.
(3) Japan—She would have to give
up her new possessions in China and
the South Pacific. Those South Pa­
cific islands have already begun to
make her rich. Her people wouH not
let go of them without a struggle.
Under the terms of the new alliance
between Japan and Russia, if Japan
should refuse to surrender those is!
ands. Russia would be obliged to sup­
port her.
Only a Truce.
(4) Nothing is, said about disarma­
ment or militarism. The hope that
has buoyed democratic peoples in
France and (treat Britain has been
the hope that the war would in some
way put an end to the armed banditti
style of government. These lerms
wouldn't do that. They would mean
nothing hut a truce with every na­
tion arming itself to the teeth and
incessantly expecting attack.
i.") Germany would be left the dic­
tator of the Balkans with supreme
influence in the near East and a
broad highway to the riches of the
rest of it. Willi her colonies hack
she would become in ten years the
eontmcrcial empress of the world,
about which time all other nations
then surviving would be driven into a
new alliance against her.
(t!) Worst of all. nothing is done
about the deep underlying economic
cause of the war. German's ambition
to have a port on the Atlantic, for
instance, is neither won nor put out
of the question. That means it will
be up again, bristling with guns. The
Allies say with reason that a peace
made in this way would be a greater
calamity to the world than the war
itself. It would have unlimited chanc­
es of catastrophe. On the strength of
the moral verdict about Serbia, Ger­
many could, if she chose, annex Hol­
land and get the mouths of the Rhine

STEPS TAKEN AT ONCE

Athens, Dec. 16.—The Greek gov­
ernment's reply accepting the terms
of the Entente Allies is a complete
compliance with the ultimatum and
expresses hope of resumption of tra­
ditional relations existing with the En­
tente.
In the text of the reply made pub­
lic today. Greece desires to give an­
other man'itestation of the proof of
its sentiments and friendship toward
the Entente.
Orders' have been given out com­
plying with all the Allies' demands.
The movement of troops and materi­
als have started and will he carried
out as rapidly as possible under the
terms of the agreement.
Satisfaction is promised for the at­
tack, December 1, upon French cit­
izens and marines at Athens. Arbi­

method to settle that controversy.

First Signs of Awakening of

Administration
NOT OPPORTUNE.
Washington, Dec. 16.—Wilson
believes the door will close upon
the great war soon, but that the
present time is not opportune.
The United States is ready to ex.
tend a mediation offer and is
merely waiting development*. It
claims any premature action to.
ward peace will spoil the whole
thing.
London, Dec. 16.—First evidence of
new blood injected into the British
and French war administration is in
the acceptance by Greece of the Al­
lies' ultimatum and the offensive of
the French at Verdun under General
Nivelle.
News from all sources continue to
pile up evidence of the determination
of the Allies to wage war to the bit­
ter Qnd. The western front had been
quiet for some time when the big
push started.
National movements which have
hanging fire for weeks are taking
shape under Lloyd George. Newa
aapers are emphasizing General Ni
velle's drive as a fitting answer to
Germany's peace proposals.
Big Maneuver.
The censors last evening released
the news of a big maneuver about
Verdun, featuritag it as France's an­
swer to Germany's peace offerings.
More than twelve square miles of the
enemy's territory was captured and
7,500 prisoners were taken.
The British embassy has advised Its
foreign offices not to return a flat fe
fusal to the peace offer because of the
ungavorable effect it would have up*
on public opinion in neutral countries.
It is believed that all the allied coun*
tries will do the same.
"The duma has unanimously passed
a resolution against the acceptance ot
the German peace proposals, after a
spirited speech by the minister of for*
eign affairs.
M. Pekrovsky in his speech in tte
duma said:
"In addressing you immediately up*
on having been appointed minister ot
foreign affairs I am not in a position
to give you a detailed statement on
the political situation, but 1 feel con*
strained to inform you without delay
and with the supreme authorization
of his imperial majesty of the atitude
of the Russian government regarding
the application of our enemies of
which you have beard through news
telegrams."
GERMANY WILL GIVE TERMS.
Washington. Dec. 16.—Germany
stands ready to give the Allies a full
statement of the terms upon which
they will consent to peace. This state­
ment was made today when Count von
BernstorfT made an official visit to
Secretary Lansing.
At the same tiem it was declared
that Germany is willing to discuss
disarmament. After a brief Tislt
Bernstorff stated that he was not dis­
couraged because the United States
failed to make a fuss over peace
claims. This leaves the nation
shape to act later.
