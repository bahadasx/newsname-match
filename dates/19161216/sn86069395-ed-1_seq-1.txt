HUGH
MARTIN
T
Famous Tenor Returns
Home of His Child
. hood Days.
To
FIRST APPEARANCE HERE
Knows The World Ove as
The Foremost American
Musician.
Quite the most pretentious musical
affair Hopkinsville has known will
take place next Monday night at the
Tabernacle. All Kentucky knows
the tremendous success which its
gifted son, Riccardo Martin (chris
tened Hugh,) has gained in grand
opera. Yet, next Monday night, he
will face, for the first time in his ca
reer as a singer, his fellow towns
men. Incidentally, Martin will sing
to Kentuckians living in more than
one Keutucky city save that in which
he was born.
Those who have known Hugh
Martin personally are not surprised
at the success he has won. Great
vocal gifts were his and great musical
talent, also. But it was due to the
fibre of the man his quick percep
tion, his vigilance and his industry
that placed him alongside of the great
Caruso and other illustrious tenors of
his time. For in the Metropolitan
Opera House New York; in the
great Criyent Gardens in London, as
well as (n other" foremost opera
houses of the world, Riccardo Martin
is recognized as one of the first half
dozen living tenors, and a man who
lias won his position by right of music
might.
Last year, and this year, too, Mr.
Martin has shared with the great
Zenatello the first tenor roles in the
Boston-National Grand Opera Com
pany and it is only due to the fact of
the holiday lay-off, which this distin
guished organization is taking, that
Martin, the fenor, is able to sing this
concert engagement.
Those who know this young man's
voice say that it has the clarion ring
in the fortisima passages, or is as
soft as velvet in quietest phrases pos
sible for a human voice to sing. It
is a voice described as absolutely
equal from top to bottom, a vojee of
the pure tenor timbre, and pro
nouncedly connoisseurs to be the
most sympathetic and most vibrant of
any American the opera or concert
stage has known. It is not in voice
alone, however, that Martin is su-
preme. in technique, no less tnan ,
in his finished interpretation of aria
or song, Martin is the artist supreme.
On Monday night he will sing arias
from operas in which he has ap-
peared before the crowned heads of
Europe and the most fastidious social
dictators of New York, Boston, Phila-
delphia and Chicago. He will also
sing a group of English songs that
carry an unquestioned heart appeal,
and he will sing operatic duets with
Miss Bianca Saroya, another gifted
American, who is ope of the first
sopranos of the Boston-National
Grand Opera Company, and declared (

Says Helen Cannell Threaten

Out of Her Body.
OPERATION LAST SPRING

Followed By Nervous Break

Business in Sh Louis.
the second examination of Frank
Smith Wednesday afternoon at 4
o'clock brought out nothing new in the
Helen Cannell case. Mr. Smith read
ily agreed to come .up on the 3:30
train from Cerulean, when telephon
ed o, and in the presence of county
and city officers, the girl's brother
and! representatives of the press,
frankly and with apparent willingness
and sincerity answered all questions
propounded to him. He reiterated his
former story and answered some ad
ditional questions suggested by later
developments. He said Miss Cannell
came to Cerulean unannounced and
as she had asked him to lend her $100
in aletter two months ago, which he
did notanswer, he supposed she came
on that business and before she said
anything about it ne told her the reason
he did not send the money, was be
cause he did not have it and that he
was still unable to let her have it.
She said that was all right and smiled
quietly. He invited her to go to the
hotel for breakfast, but she declined
and asked to be allowed to come to
Hopkinsville with him in his buggy.
On the way she was reserved and
talked but little and Mhen about com
mon place tilings, He said once on
the way they drove ott the main road
a little) way looking for a persimmon
tree but did not, see nny. She ap
peared entirely rational and did not
tell him of any troubles she had been
in nor give any information about her
purposes and plans. He could give
no theory as to what caused her to go
to the schoolhouse. When he met
her the same afternoon it was about
3:'30 and she was more than five miles
from town. He was greatly surpris
ed and asked her what sh,e was out
there for and she said she was taking
a walk. He told her she would miss
her train at 7:05, and she said she
would make it all right. When he
left her at the Hill House in the morn
ing he gave her $4 to help pay her.
way home, as she said that would be
all she needed. He did this as an act
of kindness to a woman who had
bought tobacco from him and they
were friends in a business way. No
other relation than casual friendship"
existed between them and he knew
nothing against her character in any
way. He failed to give information
a' first because he had promised her
' not to tel1 who she was- He 831(1 she

he rdtc sl,c was walking at 3.30, and
why she stopped at the schoolhouse,
near where he met her, was a mystery
that ho wished ho could help solve.
Mr. Smith gave his testimony under
'oath and his apparent candor impress
ed all of his hearers. The brother
listened attentively but made no com
ments during the entire hearing, that
lasted an hour. Mr. Smith closed
with a strong expression of his belief
in Miss Cannell's good character.
SUICIDE THEORY.
The following story from St. Louis
appeared in the Republic of Friday:
"I will burn my soul out of this
body of mine; that is the way I want
to die,"
"So Bpdlie Helen M. Cannell, now
dead frdin burns received' in a mys
terious schoolhouae firo at Hopkins
ville, Ky., to Dr. Herman W. Faber,
2133 South Jefferson avenue, this
city, two n oaths ago while taking
treatment from him.
"This material fact The ftfcpublic
learned last night while police at Hop
kinsville and members of tho Cannell
family were tryiig to solve the mys
tery of. hirtUatti,
cry store 2723 Lafayette avenue, the
governor of Kentucky had offered n
reward of $250 and the county judge
a reward of $200 for the arrest and
conviction of her slayer.
Dr. Faber told a most interesting
story to a reporter for The Republic
last night. Until two months ago he
had treated her for a nervous break
down. "One day she came to me," Dr.
Feber said, "and told me she wanted"
to die. She asked me for some pois
on that would be successful. I refus
ed. Then she wanted me tell her of
one. That, too. I refused.
"Then she turned tome," Faber
continued, and said: "Then I will
burn my soul out of this body of mine:
that is the way I want to die."
But paralleling in strangeness and
more suggestive of the murder theo
ry were other developments unearth
ed by The Republic yeslcrday.
"Dr. L. M. Ottofy, with offices in
the Grand Central ' Theatre buliding,
had treated Helen Cannell for some
time prior to her disappearance, No
vember 20.
"Since the identification of the wo
man at Hopkinsville as Helen Can
nell he yesterday gave information to
the police which he had up to that
time considered of a confidential pro
fessional nature.
"Briefly this information was to the
effect that.Miss Cannell had informed
him of an attack upon her in her- con
fectionery store last winter. As a re
sult, of this an illegal operation, she
declared, had been performed. Much
of, her nervousness, he considered
was due to this operation.
"But whether Miss Cannell went to
her death murdered, or as a suicide,
the mystery remains most bqffljng.
"If it was suicide the unfortunate
young woman apparently faced death
on a funeral pyre of her own choos
ing, but changed her mind and tore
off her burning clothes."
The suicide theory has all along had
its advocates. They have argued that
no sane woman would try to spend
the night in such a deserted house,
with many people living close by.
The wild walk itself, six miles into.
the country, was almost aninsaneact.
Leaving her money at the hotel sliow
ed premeditation. . Her failure to in'
terest Smith in her affairs, may have
made her more desperate. In the
course of travel she must have reach
ed the schoolhouse a few minutes af
ter waving a pleasant goodbye to
Smith and the little Ricketts girl in
the road at 3:30. Did she go to the
schoolhouse and brood over her
troubles for ten hours? The fire was
at 3:30 next morning. Did she a
timid, nervous woman.spend the win
ter night in such a place and set fire
to her clothing the next morning? If
it was suicide, why did she wait all
night, and if her nerve failed when
the fire burned, why did she not end
her terrible suffering by jumping into
the creek she crossed near by on her
naked flight toward town for three
long miles? Why did she go ng
ly to the hospital uid promise to re
imburse those who helped her when
she got well, saying she expected to
recover? If she wanted to die, why
did she not refuse assistance? And
above all, who visited the school-
house during the night in a rubber
tired buggy and hitched
a horse be-!
hind the house?' This fact proven by
five witnesses has not been explained.
A. H. Cannell returned to Altont
111., Wednesday night with his sis
ter's boijy. Before leaving he was
profuse in his thanks to the officers
and others who befriended his unfor
tunate sister during her last hours
and who cared for her in death.
Interest now centers in the efforts
at St. Louis to locate tho "traveling
man" whose treatment of Miss Can
nell caused her nervous collapse.

HIS HIND
President Has Not Decided on
What Action, If Any, Will
Accompany Transmission.
AUSTR0-GERMAN NOTE
May Be Forwarded Today-
Official Text Identical With
Newspaper Reports.
Washington, Dec. 15. Arrival o
both the German and Austrian peace
notes and broad intimations at the en
tente ally embassies that the proposals
of the central powers would not bo
flatly rejected without examination,
were the outstanding developments
here in the peace move.
It was stated officially that neither
Germany's nor Austria's note would'
be forwarded before today and there
was no outward indication that tho
president had made up his mind what
action, if any, he would take in trans
mitting the central power proposals
to the entente belligerents.
The change in the attitude of the
entente embassies, however, was re
garded as the most interesting devel
opment pointing to the probable prop
osition of the allies. It was indicated
that to avoid being placed in the po
sition of flatly rejecting peace over
tures without knowing what is pro
posed, it was not improbable that af
ter mature deliberation among them
selves, the allies would make reply,
inquiring upon the basis a discussion
was suggested. Such an action by
the allies, it was pointed out, would
not by any means bind them to a con
ference. The German view of the next prob
able step is that a meeting of repre
sentatives of all the belligerents
should be proposed for a general dis
cussion of the approach to a basis for
peace. German ofliciaLs here re
peatedly have expressed their con
viction that once having gone that far,
the movement would result in an ac
tual peace conference.
