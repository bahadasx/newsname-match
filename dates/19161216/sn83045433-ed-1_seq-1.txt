Germany's ofter to discus peace terms
with her em=iegs wM be forwarded to the
entente allies iumediately. It will not
be accompanted by any communiceton
which might reflect the attitude of the
United States.
President Wilson has reserved for later
consideration the question of sending
within the next two or three days an
urgent request that the peace offer be
sot trsd lightly.
It Is expected that the text of the note
will have been received in London, Paris
and Petrograd not later than Sunday

Lengest Cabinet seson.
This statement was authorized at the
White House at the close of the longest
session of the Cabinet held during the
present administratign.
The conclusion reached by the Presi

tonstrued to mean that the United
States is not ready to support and fur

movement. It was paid. The plain adopt
'd was believed to be the only policy this

diplomatic complications which would be
ditastrous to the purpose of all who are

In answer to this the German govern

conference we have proposed and we will
tell you our terms."
After this further exchange between
the belligerent powers, it is declared. the
IUnited States could suggest with much
better grace that at least a preliminary
p-ace conference be organised.
This plan is known to represent the
consensus of opinion which finally don
nated the eabinet meeting yesterday.
When members of the Cabiet had ds
parted from the White House, reporters
were permitted to learn authoritatively
that the President is not without hope
that great and lasting good will result
from the note the government is trane
mitting to the allies.
Lansing Weary Bat Pleased.
The time consumed by the Cabinet de
liberations was not the only indication
that there had been a wide difference of
opinion. Secretary Lansing, of the State
Department, was flushed and looked
weary as he emerged, but his bearing was,
that of the victor.
Mr. Lansing is understood to have
maintained the United States could not
consistently do more at this time than
act the part of messenger in forwarding
the peace offer. Secretary Daniels, of the,
Navy Deplirtment, who is one of the most

Philadeilhia. Dec. 15.-The remarkable
excuse for deserting his wife and child,
that he found It impossible to continue
supporting his family and at the same
time pursue his studies for the ministry,
was made in court today by John W.

recovered from his surprise he.-eharply
rebuked the prospective minister for the
bad example he was setting.
,"Doesnt your conscience trouble you?'

"No. It don't." replied Berge.

well received by any congregation which
you might have in the future," sad h

The court then made an order on Bergs
to pqy 33 a week for the maintenance of
his wife and their 16-unnth-.ld child.
