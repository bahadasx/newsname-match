The purely human element is
balked, but the machines keep

most paralyzed, but aeroplanes
defy the elementa.

Just now one of the wettest,
chilliest, dreariest snowfalls on
record seems bent upon ushering In

monstrous goose feathers, and com
pletely arresting nerlnl operations,

Hut artillery and trench warfare

worst possible weather can only
cause a slowing up
Kven when the snow and rain
and foR prevent all attempts at ob

mortar men have the exact range
of the enemy trenches In front
The freezing weather and thaws

is the Hritlsh Tommy's Idea to keep

Kven If there are no casualties of
the enemy, his trenches are initial

the earth rendering explosions dou
