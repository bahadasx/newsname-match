New York. Dec IS. The United
States army transport Sumner, whicb
grounded off Barnegat, X. J, Sunday
night on the way to this port from Co
lon, was abandoned by her crew early
today. Heavy seas, driven by a north
westerly wind, caused the transport to
pound heavily on the shoaL Shortly
after midnight the vessel leaked so
rapidly that the pumps and wireless
were put out of commission.
Capt. Webber and a small portion of
the crew which had remained on the
boat were taken off by boats from the
coast cutter Seneca and the Barnegat
coast guard station. Part of the crew
had been transferred to the army
transport Kilpatrick and brought here
previously.
Later it was learned that only two
boatloads of the Sumner's crew had
left the vessel. A call' was sent 10
Barnegat for lifeboats to take off the
men who remained on the transport.

Addressing Duma, Says
Russia Must Win.
London, Eng., Dec IS. Russia de
clines to entertain the proposal of the
central powers that ptace negotiations
se entered into according to dispatches
from Petrograd qujtlng the speech of
foreign minister Pekrovsky before the
duma Friday.
JL Pokrovsky in his speech to the
duma said:
"In addressing yon Immediately upon
having been appointed minister of for
eign affairs, I am not in a position to
give you a detailed statement on the
political situation, but I feel con
strained to inform you without delay
and with the supreme authorization of
his Imperial majesty of tbe attitude of
the Russian government regarding the
application of our enemies, of which
you have heard through news tele
grams. Word of peace coming from
the side which bears the whole burden
of responsibility for the world con
flagration, whicb it started and which
Is unparalleled in the annals of history
however far back one goes, were no
surprise to the allies.
"In the course of the two and one
half years of war. Germany has more
than once mentioned peace. She spoke
of It to her armies and her people each
time she entered upon a military oper
ation which was to be decisive After
each military success she put out
feelers for a separate peace on one
side or another and conducted a prop
aganda in the neutral press. All those
efforts haTe met with calm and de
termined resistance by the allied
powers.
Germany Now Proposes Peace.

make a breach in our unshakeable alli
ance, Germany makes an official pro
posal to open peace, aejaliations. Ia

"The Austro-Germans have just pro

takes into consideration the domestic

"To attempt at the last moment to

Blow Falls Like Thunder
bolt; French Attack, Sing
ing The Marseillaise.
PARIS. France. Dec 16. As his last
act before assuming the chief com
mand of the French armies on
the western front, Gen. Nivelle Friday
smashed the German line east of the
Meuse along a front of six miles, cap
turing 9000 men and SO guns. The
victory has advanced the French posi
tions two miles and they are now
within a short distance ot where the
Germans stood at the outset of the
Si eat Verdun drive. The military au
thorities describe the victory as com
plete and crushing and carried out.
without a hitch by an army of 109.000
men.
Since his last great stroke when the
blood-soaked ruins of Fort Vaux and
Douaumont fell ones more into the
hands of Verdun's defenders. Gen.
Nivelle has been quietly preparing to
push his advantage by an attack on
a larger scale. Men and guns hail
been assembled, shells piled and
everything was in readiness for the
moment when the general should see
his opportunity. Then the blow fell
like a thunderbolt.
A terrific artillery preparation flat
tened the German defences, then the
guns were elevated and threw a cur
tain of steel behind which the in
fantry from every trench from Peper
Hill to beyond Damloup dashed for
ward on an enemy still stunned bv the
bombardment.
Germans Couldn't Stem the Tide.
In places the German gallantly
strove to hold their ground but Gen.
Nivelle's dispositions were so well
made that they were generally pow
erless to stem, even momentarily, the
tide. One after another Vacherau
vllle and Louvemont villages. Cham
brette farm and tbe Hardaumount and
Bezonvanx fortified works fell with
out the defenders having time to carry
away either guns or material and
prisoners began to stream steadily
forward to pens prepared for their re
ception. TnJ, weather was wet and misty and
the French officers believe that this
fact undoubtedly led the Germans to
