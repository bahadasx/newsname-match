(By Associated Press)
' PAHIS, Dec. IB.?The number ol
r guns taken from Germans in general
Nlvellc's victory on Verrlun front at
counted up to present Is SO. accord
ing to latest report reaching hero.
As his last act boiore assuming tlu
chief command of French armies 01
the western front. General Nivellt
smashed Ccrman lines east of Meust
along a front of six miles. The victory
advanced the French position twi
' miles and they arc now within a shori
distance of where Germans stood ai
the outset of the great Verdun drive
L The military authorities ue-icriuc..
I the victory as complete and crusunic
and carried out without a hitch.
Since ins last great siriso when tin
blood soared ru.ns of Fort vaux an .
Douauniuut led once more in.o nana,
of Verdun defenders General iNiieilt
has been ciuielty preparing to push
bis advantage by an attack on lurget
scale. Men and guns have been as
sembled, shells piled and everything
I was in readiness for the moment whei
\f the General should see his opportunity
I Then the blow tell iikc a Ihundei
|i bolt. A torrilic artillery preparatioi
flattened German detenses then tbt
L gains wero elevated and through a cur
"I tain of steel behind which the inian
9 try from every trench from Poppei
Q hill to beyond Damioup dashed for
) ward on the enemy, still stunned by
' the bombardment.
In places the Germans gallantly
strove to hold their ground but Gen
eral Nivelle disposition were so wel
made that they were generally power
less to stem oven momentarily ihe tide
One after another Vacherauville anil
Louvemont villages Chambrette tarn:
and the Hardaumont and Mesonvaui
works fell without defenders havint
tlipe to carry away either guns or ma
tetlals, and prisoners began to stream
steadily rearward to pens prepared foi
their reception.
Tke weather according to hitherto
i notions was all against offensive. 1
was wet and misty and French oftlc
era believed that this fact undoubted
ly led Germans to miscalculate tlu
probability of attacks. The wet wea
ther diunot prevent aviators also from
rendortiE valuable aid to the attar,
and theiFservices are believed to have
had an important bearing on the lac.
that the fVencli forces were singularity
small.
The largp number of prisoners, uc
cording to latest advices, nearly 8,000
I Is an indication of the surprise nature
L of the onset The news of victory
w was received in Paris with enthusiasm
F as a welcome relief to the giooomy tid
' logs from Kutnania.
General Kivvllu Is the man of the
l hour. His latest achievement justi
ties his hcolce as commander in -cliiot
and augurs well for the future. The
French plan of attack was drawn up
by General N'ivelle with concutrence
of General retain who at the time
was nis superior oingcer.
The assault proper was left to Gen
oral Mangin. It was made up by live
divisions or dose to luo.ooo men.
