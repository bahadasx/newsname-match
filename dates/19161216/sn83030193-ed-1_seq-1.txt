steamship. On account of the high
seas tho llfo savers purpose to remain
on board until tho w lives subside or
It becomes absolutely necessary to
abandon tho ship.
Hope that the Sumner may be
saved was expressed this afternoon
by Col. John Carson, Depot Quarter
master hero for the Army Transport
Service, after ho had received a
wireless message from tho ship.
Tho Coast c!uard Cutter Seneca and
wrecking tugs stood by during tho
day. and the wind shifted favorably
to the northwest. Col. Carson said
ho believed tho Sumner would soon
be dragged front her position.
At noon the transport had been
given up nnd Capt. Webber was or
dned to abandon her.
Tho big wrecking tug Itcsc-uo al
most saved tho Sumner last night.
Tho transport was dragged 2.10 feet
over tho shoal at high tide and was
almost In deep water when the ruddor
post pulled out, leaving a holo in tho
stern of tho vessel through which
water poured Into the shaft tunnel,
flooding tho rnglno room.
The weight of water In tho hold held
tho Sumner firmly In tho sand and
after a little tlmo a leak was found
forward. Capt. Webber ordered forty
of his crew to leave tho hhlp. Tho

was very high when Capt. Webber
and the wrecking crow still aboard
left tho Bumner.
Tho Sumner had :S3 passengers
aboard when she ran aground In tho

John D. Manning, eighty-three years
old, millionaire banker and capitalist,
of No. 81 Riverside Drive, from mar
rying Miss Honora May O'Brien,
twenty-eight, of No. 54 West Ninety

Answering the reports that hl chil

s estimated at $15,000,000, unnounced
with great posltlvcnesa to-day that
the ceremony would bo performed In

by Cardinal Forloy. J
Membera of tho banker's family say
tho match is tho culmination of a
two-wecks' acouulntanco with Miss

O'Urlen, who hns been employed as
a secretary, was not to bo found at

where, according to a womnn who
answered the bell sho hns boarded
for several years. Thla woman sold
that Miss O'Urlen had a fino volco
nnd that her singing of "Klllarncy"
wus what had won Mr. Manning's
heart.
Occupants of the Manning homo
verified the report that ho had been
humming "Klllarney" for several
