Drifting Show Cut Off
Linglestown People
Early shopping for Linglestown res

They were snowed in. Snowdrifts to
the depth of seven and eight feet tilled
the cut between Paxtonia and Ungles
town. Tracks of the llarrlsburg Ball

yards.
The first. Einglestown car leaving
the barn at 4 o'clock this morning ran
into the drilts. One hour later a force
of 50 men was busy shoveling out the
snow. It was expected the Hacks will
be cleared this afternoon. In the
meantime Linglestown cars were run
as far as Paxtonia.
YOUR NEWSPAPER COST
Your newspaper service is the cheap
est necessity you buy. The adver
tising cost through the daily news
paper is the cheapest, manner in
which to reach customers.
This has all been effected by a won
derful world-wide organization and
system, by which the public benefit,
and an efficiency not known to any
industry.
Newspapers wlvieh have all ex
perienced enormous increases in
publishing costs of their own are
being subjected to prohibitive paper
prices and exactions many times
the increased cost of manufactur
ing paper.
The press is doing its utmost to main
tain its service to the public, with
out passing on these extortions, but
expect that at least two thousand
newspapers will be forced out of
business next year and most of the
others will show deficits.
The situation Is extremely serious, for
the publisher and the public.

METAL ASH CANS
NOT REQUIREMENT
SAYS BOWMAN
Any Receptacle in Fair Condi
tion and of Proper Size
Permissible
Metal covered ash cans are essential
to insure proper attention of the city
garbage collection contractor, accord
ing to City Commissioner Marry F.
Bowman, superintendent of public,
safety.
Any "receptacle, in fair condition
holding from one to two bushels, such
as galvanized wash tubs, grape buck
ets, wash boilers, or good sized lard
cans" will serve the purpose.
Commissioner Bowman explained
this phase of the ash collection prob
lem to-day when asked as to whether
the health bureau's notice to the pub
lie on Thursday actually restricted the
householder to the use of other ash
receptacles and made mandatory the
use of metal covered cans.
Health Hoard Starts Something
The health bureau's announcement
started a city-wide controversy and
the. Telegraph and other newspaper
offices, the public safety department
and the health office got all sorts of
complaints via mail and telephone.
The gist of the walls was that fol
lowing out of the health regulations
relative to metal ash cans would im
pose an unnecessary burden on the
public, especially in view of the high
cost of the metal receivers. Inquiry
at leading stores handling the proper
sized cans revealed the fact to-day
that cans holding from a bushel and

No Dancing Courses or
Periods at High School
Prof. 11. G. Dibble, principal of the
Central High School, denied the story
to-day that there are dancing periods
at the high school or that dancing has
been recommended as a means of
diversion or recreation between the
periods.
"A few pupils have danced during
the intermission," said Prof. Dibble
to-day, "and while no order was ever
given against this the faculty has
never given any permitting it. The
pupils never have benerally engaged
in dancing and we do not intend to
encourage the practice. All that
would be necessary to prevent, those
who remain during intermissions from
dancing would be to loc kthe piano.
The whole thing is a tempest in a tea
pot and I would discourage any
further mention of the subject were
It not for the misunderstanding that
parents may have."

DEMOCRATS PLAN
TO HOE OWN ROW,
LEADERS HERE SAY
"Peace Test" Here to Decide
Course of Minority Party
in Legislature
A majority of the Democrats who
will sit in the next legislature are in
favor of hoeing their party's own row
in the general assembly this winter
and of reaping whatever benefit they
can from the dissensions among Re
publicans which they believe will fol
low the speakership contest. About
twenty men came here for the confer
ence and dinner arranged by the
Democratic state leaders. State Chair
man Joseph F. Guffey is the host at
the dinner.
The Democrats seemed to be very
keenly interested in the Republican
contest, and rapped both sides to that
family quarrel. They were wary about
expressing an opinion on local option,
amendments to the compensation act,
the assistance clause and other mat
ters.
Names of Representatives John M.
Flynn, Elk; the oldest Democrat in
point of service; G. B. Drake, Greene,
and F. P. Islierwood, McKean, new
members, were heard mentioned for
speakership honors. The Democrats
have 37 in the House so that the nom
ination may not amount to much but
it will carry with it the tloor leader
ship.
The guests were National Chairman
McCormick; Roland S. Morris, former
state chairman; James 1. Blakslee, as
sistant postmaster general and Secre
tary Warren Van Dyke.
The only announcement prior to the
dinner was that the Democrats pro
posed to aid ill uncovering any frauds
which might be suspected in elections
in Philadelphia.

Employes have been working night

Florist Miller, who has a stand In

to-day because the fire wasgetting near
the side of the frame shed in which
the coal is stored. Mrs. Miller was
on guard and with a hose stream pre

SWEENEY AGAIN
RAPS PROPOSED
BREAD INCREASE
Declares Bakers Are Receiving
More Profit Now Than When
Flour Was Cheaper
James Sweeney, the State chief of
standards and the man who has super
vision over weights and measures, to
day gave the bakers another blast for
increasing the price of bread. A week
ago Mr. Sweeney charged that bakers
had cut down the size and increased
the price of the loaf and to-day he
charges that bakers are receiving more
profit with Hour at its present prices
than they should have when the head
of a family, as he says "is at his wit's
end to solve the problem as to how
he is going to be able to maintain his
family on his earnings."
The chief declared that the advance
in the price of bread was unwarranted
and asserted that he proposed to go
into the next legislature and ask the
enactment of a law fixing the size of
the loaf. Under the 16 ounce loaf for
live cents plan bakers got a fair profit.
The chief says they get too much un
der the eleven ounce six cent plan.
Mr. Sweeney says:
The newspapers of Thursday, De
cember 14, contained a statement from
Mr. Miller who admits his business is
selling flour to bakers. He attempts
the defense of the recommendations
of the Baker's Association in advanc
ing the cost of bread to six cents a
loaf. According to his statements, the
supposition would be that this ad
vance to six cents should be on the
eleven ounce loaf now selling for five
cents. Mr. Miller says that flour has
advanced at different periods and that
on December 5, 1916, flour sold for
$9.35 a barrel. Flour used by bakers
