NORTHWEST ALONE
USES GRAIN BAGS
GOV. WITHYCOMBE IN CALLING
ATTENTION TO ANNUAL GRAIN
GROWERS' CONVENTION POINTS
OUT THIS FACT WITH COMMENT
CORVALLIS, Ore., Dec. 16. "Wheat
growers of Oregon. Washington and
Idaho are practically the only large
producers In tho country who handle
grain in bags rather than In bulk,"
bays Governor James Withycombe In
n letter to the governors of Washing
ton and Idaho, inviting them to b
present or send representatives to the
annual grain growers' convention.
This convention will bo held In Cor
vallls January 3, 4 and 5, during Far
mors' Week. Both governors have rtn-
But Teutons Gain

nounced their intention to send per
sonal representatives as well as two
special delegates from their states
representing the wheat interests.
"The advantages of adopting the
hulk system," continues Governor
Withycombe, "are parent to anyone
who has given the subject painstaking
consideration, but to make any such
far-reaching reform as would involve
changing the system Is of course ex
tremely difficult. Not only bas the
natural prejudice born of long prac
tice to be overcome, but also economic
problems of considerable scope has
to be met. The tidewater movement
would have to be provided for the new
method of handling grain, at consid
erable expense. The farmers maoWn-
ey for storage facilities, the railroads.
carrying facilities, the exporters'
equipment, must all be changed to a
considerable degree.
"In the past, I think it can be said
fairly, men of large interests and con
servative vision have not always iden
tified themselves with meetings to
consider this matter. In this coming
convention a program of very great
worth has been prepared and perhaps
for the first time In this convention
representatives of every Interest In
volved will participate."
