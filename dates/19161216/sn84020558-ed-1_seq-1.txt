on condition that the Fnited States

his campaign agm.ist the Carranza
go' ernment.
This was olfi.'ially announced latu

tant farm crops were exhausted this
year despite the smaller si.e of the

$7.t;41.ri"!'.00 today by the department
of agriculture in its final estimates of
the year. That is $1.7.".o.Oot."i'i more
than the same crops were worth last
year. Higher prices, due partly to re
duced production and partly to the tie- '
mands for American food from the
warring nations of F,uroie were re- j
sponsible for the va.t increase in value.
Four crops each were worth more
than a billion dollars. Corn, with a
total value of $2.2'.'.'', 73,000, showed the I
greatest increase, belli); worth $.".73.-

Smith's revelation was dramatic.
Throughout a day of 1 r s-examlnation
Theodore Koche, chief r minuet for thi

from Smith an admission that his tes
timony had grown out of an alleged
atten.pt to biacknall the erman con

to Vice Consul von Schark. dated
September 22. I!l.-,. from Detroit, had
been introduced In evidence by the de
fense., One passage In the lef.er stated:
"All my correspondence I have kept,
and that shows wtur I stand, also
where you folks stand, so now 1 sec

Sacramento was handled last .May."
"Whom did you refer to by 'the Jew
from Sacramento'"" I'nited Statnf

manded on conclusior. of the cross

"That was somebody who did work
on the Htcamer Sacramento for the
Germans and jiccepteil money from
both Germans and P.r'tudi for his In
formation." Smith resp mded. "Mr.
Crowley told me he wanted the Jew
done awiy with. Il said that was the
party who was responsible for my
being suspected "f the Seattle dyna

"You Buiipocted. then, that you were

"Two of the men who kept following

Don P.athbun, chief of the local bu

knew of no person, Jew or otherwise,
who had been "done away with" In

LONDON". Dec. 1.1. A dispatch to
Router's Telegram company from I'et
rograd says: '
"The duma passed unanimously a
resolution against the acceptance of
the Herman peace propee.sals after a.
spirited speech by the mii.ihier of fi r-i-ign
affairs." -
The text of the resolution as received,
here follows:
"The duma. haying heard the state
ment by the minister of foreign af
fairs, unanimously favors a categori
cal refusal by the allied governments
to enter, under present conditions,
into any peace negotiations whatever.
"It considers that the Herman pro
posals are nothing more tl'.-in fresh
proof of the weakness of the enemy
and a hypocritical act from which the
enemy expects no real success, but by
which it seeks to throw upon others
the responsibility for the war and lor
what happened during It, and to ex
culpate itself before public opinion in
lermany.
"The duma considers that a prema
ture peace would not only be a brief
perioeJ of calm, but would involve the
danger e,f another bloeedy war and a.
renewal eif the deplorable sacrifices by
the people. H considers that a iasthur
peace will be possible only after a dc -cisive
victory over the military powers
of the enemy and after ele-finite renun
ciation by Hermany of the aspiration
which renders her responsible for tip
weirld war and for the horrors by which
it has been accomplished."
M. I'okrovsky, in his speech to the
duma. said:
"In addressing you immediately -upon
having be-on appointed minister of for
eign affairs, I am not in a position to
give you a d-tailed statement on the
political situation, but I feel constrained
to inform you without delay and with
the supreme authorization of his im
perial majesty of the attitude of th"
Russian government regarding tiie ap
plication of our enemies, of which ou
have heard through news telegrams.

tains no tangible indications regarding

astated and occupied Kelgium. Serbia

"The Atistro-Hermans have just pro
claimed an illusory independence for

takes into consideration the domestic
