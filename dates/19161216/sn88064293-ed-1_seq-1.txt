Review Doll and Toy
Fund Closes Dec. 21
The Fund is Still in Need of
Financial Heipto Make
It a Great Success
When you read the call for con
tributions to the Review Doll and
Toy Fund do you sit back compla
cently and wonder why a certain
fellow dont come across with his bit?
Do you wonder why this one or that
one has no representation in the
list? Do you think that all the Dol!
and Toy dope that has been handed
to you in forty varieties has all been
directed at the "other fellow?" Nay,
nay. If your name doesn't appear in
the long list below, YOU are the
gink who lias been the target. Not
the 'other fellow." YOU.
■ o just lay off of these wonder
in vs about the others and let the
id a firmly sink into your dome of
j '.bought that it is squarely up to you.
j ftcr counting 'em over on an
adding machine, The Review finds
I that there are following delin quents
in all classes: Four hundred and
seventy who are able to give from
five dollars upward who have not re
sponded; seven hundred fifty who
could give one dollar upward: four
teen hundred ninety-one who could
give from fifty cents to one dollar,!
and nineteen hundred and twenty- j
two who could give from five cents
to fifty cents. All these folks are
holding out on Old Kris, and, by
jing, it'll serve 'em dead right if the I
•
old gent passes every last one of'em!
up when he makes his annual visit, p
Already, it has been possible by j
the big-hearted, generous folks — 1
presented in the list given below 7o i
do something for the little, poverty- 1
pinched, off-springs at Christmas
time. But, for doing it up .......
big, broad; handsome manner that
falls so naturally to the part of Mor
gan City, the amount is insufficient.
Ladies and gentlemen, girls and
boys, if the stunt is to be pulled in
big-league order you've got to slip i
your bit to the diddies and slip lively.
December 21st is the date for closing !
the list for the Doji and Toy Fund. '
Just a few more days left for you to
help out. A nickel or a dime wont
break you and it surely will dish up
a heap of hilarity for some little,
old hick that would otherwise have
nothing.
The ladies of the King's Daugh
ters have planned to have the big
blow-out for the kids on December
23rd. Seven days off. That's why
you'll have to step lively.
All funds contributed to The Re
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
bursed by The King's Daughters of
this city. The Peoples State and Sav
ings Bank is the place of deposit for
the Fund but contributions will be
accepted by the banks of Morgan
City and by a number of the busi
ness men. Be certain that your name |
and the correct amount you coiitri- !
bute appear in the colums of this
paper.
$5 In Gold

A BUSINESS OFFICE
FOR THE FARN
If you are planning to build a
farm home, make it complete by in
cluding in your plans space for an
office. Such a room in the farm home
should be considered more as a nec
essity than a luxury. You have a
place in which-to look over and care
for your mail, to file your business
documents, to keep your agricultural
papers and books, and to receive
your business callers. Such a room
would be a great incentive to the
proper business management of the
farm.— L. S. U. Press Bulletin.
