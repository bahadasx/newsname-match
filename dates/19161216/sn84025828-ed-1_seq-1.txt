TANGLE IN SUPERIOR
COURT CLERK'SOFFICE
An audit of tho books of tho clork
of tho Superior Court has boon or
dered by the Judgos in nn effort to
straighten nut a tnnglo Involving
$22,000 of trust funds doposltod In
the dofunct I.n Sallo Strcot Trust
and Savings Dank.
Tho audit wns decided upon follow
ing nn appeal to the Judgos by John
KJollandor, who took ofllco ns clork
of tho court, succeeding Itlchard Mc
Grnth. KJollandor desired to avoid
assuming any porsounl liability for
tho monoy lost In tho Lorlmor bank
under tho McOrnth reglmo.
KJellander refused to tako over tho
trust fund until tho matter was
stralghtoned out. This fund, consist
ing of monoy Intrusted to tho court
clerk pending tho sottlomont of liti
gation, totals $57,000, of which $35,000
Is on deposit In solvent banks and
$22,000 In tho La Sallo Streot institu
tion. Tho amount In tjio La Sallo
Street Dank formerly totaled $29,000,
but was reduced by $7,000 by pay
ments of tho receiver.
Tho chief difficulty has been caused
by tho fact that tho records fail to
show what particular estates or liti
gants own tlio money tied up In tho
Ln Sallo Strcot Hank or tho money in
other banks. All funds wero handled
In n common account.
Tho nccountnnt, who will stnrt

will suffer it thero Is n shortage,
A committee composed of Judgos

INSULL OBJECTS
Describes Home Rule on Public Utilities
Administered by the City Certain
to Be Inefficient.
President Instill of the Common
wealth Edison Company, chairman
of tho board of directors of tho Peo
ple's (las Light nnd Coko Company
and Identified with numerous other
utility corporations, described homo
rulu by the city council as Inefficient.
Tho committee, of which Medlll
Mcl'ormlck Is chairman, met nt tho
Hotel I.u Salle, resuming an inquiry
begun Hovernl months ago.
Mr. Insull said that while he would
prefer tho retention of tho present
stnto commission, with Its broad pow-'
ors over both Intorurbnn and local
utilities, It was the business of his
company to adjust themselves to
whatever laws are passed.
"First of all, I favor state regula
tion by one commission," said Mr.
Insull. "If thero must bo locnl con
trol then I prefer control by a small
local commission Instead of by u large
and cumbersomo city council. I
would rather havo this local com
mission appointed by the governor,
but If not then by tho mayor, subject
to tho coullrmatlon of tho council.
"I havo had two striking expe
riences within tho last year In tola
lion to regulation," said Mr. Insull,
"Tho Commonwealth Edison Com
pany llled with tho stnto utility com
mission a uindlllcntlon of Its scalo of
rates. After tho matter had boen con
sidered nt sovornl public hearings tho
ratos wore allowed to go Into offect
with a saving to tho consumers of tho
City of Chicago of $1,000,000 annually.
"Having a little nioio complicated
situation in tho enso of tho Pcoplo's
(ias Light and Coko Company and
desiring to put Into effect a reduction
In rntos and to chuugo tho standard
nnd nlso to bring to nn end costly
litigation betweon tho city and tho
company it seomod ndvlsablo to got
tho consent of tho city council for
an application to tho state commis
sion. "A lottor was addressed to tho
mayor of Chicago on Dec. 9, 1915, ono
year ago. and the matter was referred
promptly to tho council commlttco.
They have had all kinds of hearings,
but wo are no nearer tho point whero
wo can make application to tho stnto
commission than wis weio a year ago.
In the mcantimo tho consumers havo
paid about $1,250,000 more than thoy
would hnvo If tho standard had been
chnnged and our rates accepted.
"Wo havo been trying for four or
llso years beforo tho city council to
bring about an improved system of
transportation, a uulllcatlon of tho
surfaco and clewited linos, a system
of through routing and rapid transit.
It was tho political football of tho
last administration, ami wo are no
further nlong with It than four or five
years ago."
"I am very much opposed to deal
ing with matters of this kind directly
through tho city council. Tho trend
throughout tho United States has
been toward state regulating bodies.
It Is n question of elllclency. Judging
from criticism, In one newspaper of
tho Chicago city council nnd In an
other of the mayor, It Is natural that
a man who Is responsible for raising
millions for utility companies should
hesitate to chnngo tho present sys
tem. "The only chnngo I would suggest
Is to subject municipally owned
plants to tho samo drastic regulation
us prlvntely owned plants."
Mr. Insull snld It was Important that
rates and tho Issuance of stocks nnd
bonds should bo controlled by tho
sunn opposed locnl control
of i -late control of securi
ty
v illlimi a. Ilealo, nttornoy for tho
Commonwealth Edison Company, nlso
was present. He expressed himself
along the samo Hues ns Mr. Insull.
"All our largo cities which havo
largo city councils havo lnolllclont
government," said Mr. Ilealo. "Tho
only well-governed largo city in tho
Pulted States Is Washington, which
doesn't govern Itself."

HIGH STATEJAX RATE
Illinois Is confronted with tho high
ost tax rato In Its history. Tho stnto
faces n doflclt of $3,500,000 becauso
tho rato was llxed too low last your.
Stato Treasurer Androw Hussol, who
rofuscd to sign tho low rato last year,
said today that an 85 cont rnto will
bo necessary to meet tho present situ
ation. Tho highest into horotoforo
was 70 cents on tho $100 valuation.
That wns llxed In 1913.
In 1911 it wns 18 cents nnd In 1915
It wns placed nt 55 conts. Tlton Mr
Hussol protested, assorting tho rato
was too low nnd would rosult In n
deficit in tho gouornl fund. ,
TAX LAWS TO

Kevlslon of untlquatod laving laws
of Illinois was mado possible yostor
day whon tho state canvassing board
at Sprluglluld ruled that tho tax
nmondniont to tho constitution wns
adopted at tho rocont election.
In so acting mombors of tho board
admitted thoy woro doubtful on tho
lognl Issues Involved, hut bolleved an
opportunity should bo glvon to got

Following action on this proposition
tho stnto olllclals resolvod themselves
Into tho stnto tnx commission nnd
