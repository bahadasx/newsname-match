Washington, Dec.
16.—President
Wil­
son's decision to forward the central
powers' peace notes to the entente al
lies without any mediation offer by the
American government left today only
the task of translation and revision of
phraseology to be finished before they
are transmitted.
The president's determination to
have the United States,act only as a
medium for the exchange of notes was
made after a prolonged cabinet meet
ing yesterday.
The notejj. received from Germany,
Austria and Turkey were meant to be
identical. ±ut the translations received
here differed slightly Mn' wording and
an effort was made today to harmonise
them. The American representatives
In each of the central eapitqjs will be
requested to transmit the original doc
uments.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, conferred witl* Secretary
Lansing today seeking information of
the attitude of the United .States to
ward the peace proposal of the cen
tral powers, to- discuss the subject of
peace from this government's view
point, and *0 give any inforlfiatlon de
sired on the attitude of -the German
government. v'. -, -is#?
Peace Tkrmt Not Di«cu»*ed._
Ambassador Bernstorff said after a.
ten-miltirtevvisit with Secretary Lan
sing:
.••We- did not discuss peace terms in
any way. 1 have not treceived any
formal terms and the American gov
ernment knows/officially that no form
al terms* have been proposed.. All Ger
many has suggested is that the bellig
erents get together and talk. If that
proposal is liccepted, definite terms
naturally will be ••discussed, but till
then it will not be proper to mentioif
them. My visit to the secretary was
purely for general discussion."
The ambassador indicated that the'
place for the holding of a conference
and the question as to whether it
Should be by direct negotiations or
thru mediation were dependent entire
ly upon whether the entente allies
would discuss the proposals at all.
Secretary Lansing said early today
the peace notes probably would go for
ward before night. One uniform trans
lation will be sent to American repre
sentatives where the United States,
represents the allies and the original
text will go forward later.
Delay in Lleyd-Geerge Statement.
London, Dec. 16.—It appears doubt
ful today whether Premier Lloyd
George will be able to go before tfye
house of commons next Tuesday, lie
is making good progress toward recov
ery, but it is unlikely his physicians
will permit him to speak next week, as
lis voice Is affected.
It is not likely, however, thfct the
government by that time will be pre
pared to make a statement.
TEST OF PEACE PROPOSALS.
London Nation Declares Both Side*
Must Concede Liberty of Nation*.
London, Dec. 16.—The first essential
of peace, in the opinion of the Nation,
is that both sides Bhall concede the
right of independence to all nations.
Commenting on the peace offer, the
fration says:
"The test will come when our answer
is known and Germany must decide
whether she must modify her offer and.
come nearer, our position. The teal,
onus for the continuance of the way will
rest on the side which maintains any
demand which would be fatal to the in
dependence and future of any belliger
ent. If Germany, for instance, has
really claimed 8erbia as her prey, she
has included at least one point whloh
convicts her of either unbelievable stu
pidity or mere insincercity and, if the
claim is maintained, precludes further
discussion. Byt even to any offer In
cluding such a point, cur answer as'4?*
be reasoned and precise. We shall lose
nothlngMn the world's court of honor
by rejecting -that claim, but let us not
lose sight of our guiding prlncpile that
this war Is waged for the ending of
militarism.
"If Germany makes a ciaim inv^lvJr.S

not yet won. Her repudiation of all
such claims will be the test of her .sin

History of the Dahlia.
By a curious horticultural irony the
dahlia, which has become the popular
idol of our early autumn flower shows,
possesses a sadly prosate history, the
London Chronicle remarks. It has
been dev«!»p5d frorr: the Mexican tu
bers introduced about one hundred and
thirty years ago by the Swedish bot
anist, Doctor Dahl, for the purely
commercial purpose of supplautlng or
supplementing the potato. They did
nui "cuUli
(cs,"
and the dahlia dish
soon disappeared from British dinner
tables, but our gardeners at once saw
the latent possibilities of .the flower,
from which they have evolvotl the
double dahlia and other delightful
floral fantasies. Thus the dahlia has
exactly reversed the fate or the red
clover, which came to us lu the guise
of a garden flower bat was found to
ninke fine forage. The tubers of the
dahlia, too acrid for our tastei are
still eaten Id some p&rts'of (Trance.
