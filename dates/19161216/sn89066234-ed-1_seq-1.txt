We are, thus, certain that the
government does not care how

for the mass of people i so long as

Hunger and want can not be
stopped by investigations, reports
or law suits. The way to stop
price boosting and gambling in
life's necessities is to feed, house
and clothe every man. woman
aniVtihlld in the United States.
The country is rich enough to do
so. The only thing that stands
in the way is old party respect
for private profit and old party
contempt for human life, liberty
and happiness.
SPEAKING OF RACE SUICIDE.
TV attention of the advocates
of big families and the opponents
of race auicido is respectfully, or
otherv ise, called to the report on
deatna of Chicago babies in the
Journal of the Vineriean Medical
As .o latlon.
There is nothing new in the re
nnet. The' same thing has been
discovered every time an investi
gation of Infant mortality has
been made anywhere on enrth.
Hut until the wholesale killing
of babies becomes a matter of
complete indifference, such re
Kjrts are at least worthy of edit
orial mention. This is especially
truc in a society where preachers
still hold up the slaughter of the
innocent by Herod as one of the
great crimes of history.
It is claimed by the majority of
I commentators today that in this
! famous .ludcan massacre some 80
! infants were killed,
j The Chicago investigation Stud
; ied closely 800 cases of infant
Ueaths. The investigators found
that in only 127 families was the
income over $15 per week. Ninety
three per cent of the deaths were
in families with an income of 910
or less per week.
This is the same story that was
told by the investigation of the
federal childrens bureau at Johns
town, i'a. Similar facts were
brought out in the recent housing
investigation by the Milwaukee
department of health.
Therefore it should be said, over
and over ageing, that the most
deadly disease in the world is pov
erty. These 300 children were
sentenced to death because their
pareuts were poor. It would have
been a merciful act to have
knocked them in the heads the
day they were born. But society
reset
fed them for months or tor-
ture.

reason for this is the ever Increas

.Not only are officials continual

I but the cost of the keep of the

alarmingly. And when nil effort is

IMMIGRATION AND WAGES.
By Scott Nearing.
The United States Immigration
Commission which spent several
months and hundreds of thous
ands of dollars during its inquiry
into the immigration problem, fi
nally published its report in forty-two
voluinnes. By way of
summary of this vast mass of evi
dence, the Commission states.
The Investigations oi the com
mission show an over-supply of I
unskilled labor in basic industries !
to an extent which indicates nn
over supply of unskilled labor In
the Industries of the country us a j
whole, a condition which de
mands legislation restricting the
further admission oi such unskill
ed labor."
The Immigration Commission
further suggested that "it is de
sirable in making the restrictions
that a sufficient number be de
barred to produce a .marked ef-,
feet upon the present supply of '
unskilled labor." Elsewhere in
the reiKtrt, the Commission called
attention to the tact that thai
economic und social standard ol
the working population of the I
United States were being great-1
ly lowered through the coinpeti-
lion in the labor market of large
numbers of unskilled foreigners I
who come to the United States ;
without any families, and who;
were willing to live on a stand
ard much lower than that gener-
ally accepted by American work-1
el's.
The European war has given
the American people a chance to
try out the effects of immigra
tion restriction. The total num
ber of Immigrants in 1018 and
11)14 was slightly less than a mil
lion and a quart i f"i' each year.
In 1018 the Immigration dropped
to one-third of a million o'ejii
700) Here was an artificial cut
of almost a million in tic nam-
bcr oi Immigrant arrivals.
At the same time there was a
tremendous spurt m industrial no

i ),;, over 1015,
While the number of available
laborers w as decreasing, the num
ber id' jobs was increasing with
the inevitable result high wages
in most of the unskilled labor
markets of the country . Large
numbers of American wage and
salary earners liave received no
wage increase during the past
two y ears, but the unskilled labor
market has moved up everywhere
from It) to 50 per cent, in some
cases even more than that.
The conclusion which this sit
uation forces upon the observe!
,of economic conditions is ipiile
obvious. If we could substitute
! for our
present hit-or-miss s v s-
tern
that
of Immigration a scheme
would prevent any iniiiti-
Kraut who did not have a Job at
a wage representing liviiu de
cency from entering the country
vvc could prevent niucn ot the dis
astrous competition between un
skilled laborers for unskilled Jobs
and thus succeed In building up
the unskilled labor market to a
level that would at least provide
a minimum standard of physical
health and social decency. Such
a provision is no remedy for the
worst aspect of the wage system,
but jt would lop off a bi branch
of the system that has expressed
itself in frightfully low wages,
long hour's, and liv ing conditions
surrounded by all the squalor and
misery that usually accompan
ies poverty,

Now, think a bit. For the past

what is wrong III Mexico to pre

In the loth century light was

had passed through a thousand

Dark Ages, when learning among

THE shell GAME,
A dispatch from Washington
says that the supreme court has
set January 8 for the hearing of
arguments in the 8-hour law case.
The law was supposed to take ef
fect January 1, but the dispatch
says the attorneys for the gov
ernment and the railroads have
agreed that the law "shall not
be enforced until the supreme
court hands down its opinion."
I was afraid of that. And by
the time the court "hands down
its opinion," tlie babies of the rail
road men may grow up to have
whiskers. But by what authori
ty do government and railroad
lawyers set aside the laws en-
acted
by congress? It is bad
enough for the courts to do it
but we are used to Hint.
If the working class could only
get into their heads th i size of
the shell game that is worked on
them in the name of "government
and justice," tliey would change
