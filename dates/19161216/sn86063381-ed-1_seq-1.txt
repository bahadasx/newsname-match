ALSO FORMED IN BEMIDJI
Movement Launched to Provide
Means for Home Entertainment
Officers are Elected.
Bemidji is to be represented at
the St. Paul wnter carnival of sports
the week of January 27 and Bemidji
is also to have a Carnival Associa
tion for the furthering of winter
aports at home. This was the deci
sion of a large and representative
gathering of citizens in the Commer
cial club headquarters last evening.
Not only were business! men present
but several of the prominent ladies
of the city and no better boosters
were in evidence than were these
same representatives of the fair sex.
President Denu of the Commercial
club called the meeting to order and
outlined the object of the gathering
after which the question of the St.
Paul trip was discussed, free expres
sion being heard for and in some
quarters rather luke warm. How
ever, no utterance was directly in
opposition, everyone giving expres
sion to opinion in the interests of Be
midji.
At a result of the discussion a per*
manent Carnival association was
launched and the intent is to "do
things" at home for the cementing of
a better community spirit and enter
tainment for the people of Bemidji.
Officers were named as! follows:
PresidentE. E. McDonald.
Vice PresidentMrs. A. P. White.
SecretaryH. E. Reynolds.
TreasurerMrs. Eduard Netzer.
A committee to select the various
working committees was also named,
the personnel being F. S. Lycan, W.
L. Brooks and A. A. Warfleld.
Mr McDonald was the principal
speaker anent the St Paul pilgrimage
and he outlined what it meant at
length He strongly advocated Be
midji being represented, asteerting
that rival cities were to be present
in force and that Bemidji could not
afford to be absent. About 25 sign
ed the roster indicating their intent
to make the trip and an active cam
paign will be waged to enlist others
with the object of having Bemidji
make a creditable showing in the car
nival parade Those participating
will be attired in a suitable and at
tractive costume which, in all proba
bility, will also be the one adopted
in the formation of the local Car
nival association. For the local as
sociation the question of finances* was
broached to promote suitable feat
ures for the enjoyment of the winter
months. A skating rink, toboggan
slide ,curlmg rink, hockey rink and
warming house for the participants
were mentioned and annual dues
for membership were fixed at the ex
tremely low figure of $1. Over 35
signed to join the association.
Just about the most interesting
speech of the evening was* made by
E. B. Berman when he addressed the
chair and stated that in the treasury
of the Fourth of July celebration
committee there remained $200, the
celebration having been projected by
the Merchants' association He also
remarked that in all probability this
sum could be secured for the promo
tion of winter sports in Bemidji. A
committee consisting of Charles Com
insky, E. H. Den,u and Mayor Van
dersfluis was appointed to confer with
the Merchants' association relative to
the $200.

DESIGNERS WANT LONGER
SKIRTS COMING SEASON
(By United Press*)
Chicago, Dec. 16.The man with
an eye for a nifty ankle would better
get in his full share of looks pretty
quickfor soon there aren't going
to be any nifty ankles. They are not
going to disappear per se but they
are going to disappear from sight.
Sentence was passed on them to
day by the Designers' Association of
Women's Clothes*, in session here.
Skirts are to be longer. Much long
er. The whole motif in dressing is
to be different. Artistry in design
and long flowing lines are to be de
pended on for charm and attention
as against "see more" styles of today.
But in the edict the dress design
ers have reckoned without the ma
kers of women's) shoes. They are in
the campaign hot and heavy to keep
the skirts up. "If skirts go down,"
said a plea in a shoe trade journal,
"the high priced and frequently pur
chased footwear will be replaced with
less expensive kinds so something
must be done to stop the descent."
"DEAD" MAN BELIEVED
TO BE ALIVE VIGIL
Seattle, Dec. 16. At the county
morgue the coroner is keeping vigil
over what a physician lias pro
nounced a corpse and what relatives
say is a living man in an epileptic
state.
Cyrus C. Blouch was found seated
in his chair at home and could not
be roused. Though the stethoscope
and physisological tests pointed to
death, at the request of his sister-in
law, Mrs. Pearl E. Creager, the cor
oner's office has delayed embalming
processes because she says* he was
subject to epileptic fits.
Deputy Coroner William E. Schlin
sock is watching the body for signs
of returning life.
POLICEMEN MAKE SHORT
WORK OF SALOON BAB
Seattle, Bee, 16.Ten thousand
dollars worth of fixtures were de
stroyed last night by policemen in
the Amertean cafe-barroom
street and E. D. Morris1,
lesseonofPike the
premises and proprietor of the resort,
was arrested on the charge of violat
ing the state prohibition law. All
wooden furniture was 'Chopped to
pieces andf the plate glass mirrors,
glassware and cash register were re
duced to rubbish.
I
MONEY is FOUND
UNDER MATTRESS
AFTER PRISONERS
HAD BEEN TAKEN
Chief Ripple Gets on Job After Al
leged Holdup and Discovers
Four Dollars.
REVOLVER IS ALSO FOUND
EVIDENCE BELIEVED STRONG
Accused "Look Pleasant" as Pictures
are Taken Judge Fisk to
Hear Evidence.
What is believed to be convincing
evidence in the case of Fred Wilson
and Mac Wroat, accused of having
held up Harry Reed and a compan
ion at the point of a revolver in the
Soo railroad yards early yesterday
morning, has been secured by Police
Chief Ripple when he searched the
room occupied by the accused. Four
one dollar bills and a revolver were
found in the room after Officer Zach
arias had taken the pair into cus
tody.
To a representative of the Pioneer,
Reed stated that he believed $4 was
secured from his companion whom he
knew only as "Joe," the latter being
on his way to a lumber camp at the
time of the holdup. Reed also stated
that "Joe" had about $25 which the
alleged thugs overlooked.
The finding of the four one dollar
bills seems to confirm the statement
of Reed and the fact that Chief Rip
ple discovered the bills under the
mattress of the bed is also taken to
indicate an attempt to hide the
whereabouts of the money.
Reed claims a gun was thrust into
the face of "Joe" but when Officer
Zacharias placed the accused under
arrest no gun was found on them.
In a brief interview at the city
jail, the man giving the name of Wil
son stated that he didn't have nerve
enough to do a holdup stunt, but
Chief Ripple regarded the assertion
as old stuff and paid no attention
to it.
Today the prisoners were "mug
ged" (pictures taken) and they will
be arraigned before Judge D. H. Fisk
for a hearing.
Chief Ripple is of the belief the
prisoners are headed for Stillwater
as he says he hag convincing proo'f
of guilt.
PENDERGAST LEAVES
TUESDAY FOR ST. PAUL
Judge G. Pendergast, represen
tative-elect from the Sixty-second
district, whose home is in Bemidji,
leaves for the state capitol next
Tuesday to stort of get onto the ropes
previous to the opening of the state
legislature. He intends to remain
until the opening of the session.
"Seems as though everyone is a
candidate for speaker but myself,"
remarked Mr. Pendergast, "and I
guess it is up to me to get the votes
for all of 'em."
The location of the proposed nor
mal school in Bemidji is a piece of
legislation that will attract consid
erable attention and from all appear
ances there seems to be considerable
work to be done to get the measure
through.

der of Deputy Sheriff Thomas James
C. Myron during the strike trouble

EXPLANATION
At the meeting of the city coun
cil last Monday evening the alder
men by a vote of five to t^o voted
to seat Thomas Ervin to .fill a va
cancy in the representation of the
First ward. ^Ir. Ervin was a new
resident of the First, moving froA
the Fourth. Previous to the seating
of Alderman Ervin, a petition signed
by nearly 100 residents of 'the First
ward was presented to the council
requesting that A. M. Bagley be
named to fill the vacancy, the sign
ers, it being claimed, representing a
large majority of the voting strength
of the precinct.
The action of the city council oc
casioned an editorial in the Weekly
Sentinel and in reply thereto E. C.
McGregor of the First makes public
the following communication in the
Pioneer which is self-explanatory:
Editor of Pioneer:
Dear Sir-I read the editorial in
the Sentinel of Dec. 15 with re
gard to the appointment of Mr.
Thomas Ervin as alderman of
the First ward. In justice to all
concerned, including both Mr.
Bagley and Mrs. Ervin and es
pecially those who signed the pe
tition, I have this explanation to
make which I trust will clear up
the situation:
About ninety per cent of the
signatures on the Bagley peti
tion were secured by me. In
practically every case I explained
the proposed action of the coun
cil to the person about to sign
the petition. In cases where I
did not go into detail I assumed
that person was familiar with
the situation.
Very truly yours,
E. C. McGregor.
MILITIAMEN HURT
WHEN TRAIN JUMPS
(By United Press)
Grapeland, Tex., Dec. 16.Several
members of Battery A, Iowa Field ar
tillery, were injured today when a
broken rail on the International &
Great Northern line caused two
Pullman cars to leave the track. The
injured were taken to Palestine.
TOT MANUFACTURE AND B0AD
BUILDING ABSORB MAIMED
(By United Press)
Winnipeg, Man., Dec. 16.Ab-
sorbing its crippled returned sol
diers into civilian life through of
fering them work in a great toy fac
tory, Winnipeg today hoped to en
ter the world's market as a toy pro
ducing center. It is certain that at
least on this side of the border, toys
marked "Made in Canada" will be
far more popular than those labeled
"Made in Germany."
Constructing a great highway
across Canada is another means pro
posed for absorbing the unemployed
crippled soldiers returned from the
European battle fields. The road
would perhaps start at Halifax,
thence run to Moncton, then follow
the St. Lawrence to a point opposite
Quebec. Ottawa would then be touch
ed and the road would take a
straight line to Winnipeg, extending
west through Brandon, Regina,
Moose Jaw and Medicine Hat. From
Calgary to Vancouver, a distance of
750 miles of most beautiful Canadian
Rockies, the road is practically com
pleted already.

FIGURES SHOW DRUNKENESS
ON DECLINE IN ENGLAND
(By United Press)
London, Dec. 16.If any accurate
estimate can be made while so many
men are away at the fighting front,
it would appear that drunkeness in
England and Wales has decreased
since the war began. A Blue Book
has been issued purporting to sfhow
a decrease of 48,017 convictions for
drunkeness during 1915.
The greatest decrease in the con
sumption of liquor appeared in ag
ricultural counties on the east coast.
In some of these convictions for
drunkeness dropped 41.8 per cent,.
The "no treating law" undoubtedly
has* aided in reducing the consump
tion of intoxicants. During the last
six months of 1915 there were only
42,842 convictions for violating the
"no treat" law as compared to 48,-
750 during the first half of the year.
Throughout the entire year of 1916
there were only 135,811 drunkards
convicted, which is the lowest num
ber recorded for nearly forty yeara
and is 28 per cent below the total for
1913. Of these convicted in 1915,
32,211 were women.
