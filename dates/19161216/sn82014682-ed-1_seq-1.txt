SUTOS RIGHT
Hi JURORS
In Just what respect the territorial
grand jury has authority to make rec
ommendations to county or other bod
ies Is a question that Attorney Lorrln
Andrews, chairman of the civil service
commission, would like, to have an
': swered.
I Andrews contends that the jury had
no authority to recommend ' that the
commission reinstate Jesse Gray as
jxlice officer at Wahiawa; : whichjby
the way, the commission h Zf
refused to do. ' f
"The grand Jury, not being consti
tuted a court of appeals to "view the
decisions of the commission, I do not
see how the, commission could take
Its recommendations Into con-sldera-
' Jion," the chairman declares.
Andrews says he has had -an ex
Whange of 'notes" with Raymond C.
Brown, secretary of the grand jury,
regarding the recommendations and
the commission's actions on them.
"In my opinion the Jury ' has no
right to mix up in the affairs of any
other public bodies," Andrews adds.
SAYS CUHJYFF
' .Although charged with first degree
murder, Murata Tokubeye, Japanese,
Vwith the approval of the city attor
tiey's office, pleaded guilty to murder
ln the second degree in Circuit Judge
Ashford'g court today. He will be
sentenced at 9 o'clock next Saturday
morning.
The case is a disgusting one, it be
ing alleged by the prosecution that
the defendant committed a number of
statutory offenses, hia 17-year-old
daughter being the victim. When he
found that the girl was accepting the
attentions of another man the father,
in a fit of jealousy, killed her with a
knife, it is alleged.
Much of the Investigation leading to
the arrest of the Japanese was done
by Deputy City Attorney Charles Chil
lingworth and . Criminologist Harry
Lake of the city attorney's office.
The supreme court on Friday
handed down a decision affirming the
. judgment of the district magistrate in
the case of the Honolulu Construction
& Draying Co. against H. B. Reade,
an action for alleged debt.

CHANGES IN TAX
ON INHERITANCES
Charles H. Merriam Recom
mends Graduated System
for Consideration
Members of the territorial tax com
mission will probably take up for de
cision at the session to be held -some
night next week the question of
whether or not to recommend to the
legislature a proposed change in the
inheritance law submitted by Charles
H. Merriam, secretary. .
Mr. Merriam expressed the belief
today in discussing the proposal that
it will be more equitable and Just byl
j far than the present system, and will
I also follow in general the majority
of the mainland fetates as well as the
British government.
The secretary proposes in his re
port to the commission a graduated
system of tating heirs instead of the
flat rate now provided by law. This
rate is at present! 2 per cent for all
Inheritance money above $5000 receiv
ed by near relatives- and for others S
per cent above $500.
Under the new plan near relatives
would pay at the following rate; $500
to $10,000 at i per cent; $10,000 to $20,
000 at 2 per cent; $20,000 to $50,000
at 3 per cent; $50,000 to $75,000 at 4
per cent; $75,000 to $100,000 at 5 per
cent; $100,000 to $250,000 at 7 1-2 per
cent, and above $250,000 at 10 per
cent. '; : '
For distant relatives and friends the
rates would be: 3 per cent for $500 to
$5000; 5 "per cent from. $5000 to $20,
000; 10 per cent from $20,000 to $50,
000;20 percent from $30,000 to $100,
000, and 30 per cent for $100,000 or
more. :, '. ' : . . ' '

Chamber of Commerce Com
mittee Lays Plans for Edu
cation of Citizens
To make a stady cf the vice condi
tions of Honolulu so that the data col
lected can be clearly and lucidly pre
sented to the people of Honolulu at a
future mass meeting: to inaugurate a
campaign of education in order that
the people will-know what is taking
place in the underworld;. and to favor
the passage of "an abatement by in
junction" act by the legislature, is
the campaign outlined today at a meet
ing of a special committee of the
Chamber of Commerce. Th commit
tee is composed of Judge W:-'L.. Stan
ley, chairman; W. R. Farrington, Rob
ert Horner, Judge S. B. Dole, James
A. Rath and F, C. Atherton. With
these ends in view a committee com
posed of Farrington, Rath, Horner and
Raymond C. Brown was formed to
adopt a policy and to formulate a
concrete plan with which to go before
the public at such a meeting.
Education Deemed Essential
That if vice is stamped out cf Ho
nolulu the people; must be educated.
wa8 the opinion of the committee.
and to accomplish this a widespread
publicity campaign was approved. in
conjunction with the mass meetings
that are planned. It was pointed
out that the vice wave, which is
spreading out over the city. Is having
demoralizing effects among the
younger population who are begin
ning to think that there Is nothing
immoral about their conduct' "The
only way which it can be curbed,'
aid Mr. Atherton, "is to show them
that such action will be frowned
upon."
Police Headquarters Blamed
The question of the best means of
reducing the evil was next taken up
Judge Dole said the trouble, bo far
as tlie police went; was entirely due
to the rottenness i of headquarters
which, ha- -coatliraUy. dJjU5praged
the men below irom vupkolding ; the
law, and the other members concurred.
The abatement act was suggested and
it was the .-opinion of the members
that it should be passed by the legis
lature, and other methods talked over.
Mr. Brown said that some of the
Iwilei women had scattered over the
city and gave an Incident of a com
plaint which came to him from a man
who said that the house next to his
was being used for immoral purposes.
Must Be Popular Demand
Mr. Farrington sounded the key
note of the meeting when he said.
"The people do not know what is
going on, and . before we can do any
thing to change the condition, they
must be educated. We cannot depend
upon the police department, for the
beads are spineless. The people them
selves must demand that the city be
cleaned up.

Fears of Honofulu housewives that

not be enteVfeiaed, at least for the
present, because wholesale flour prices
In Honolulu have dropped CO cents a

Present wholesale prices for stand
ard grades of flour in this city are now
$9 a barrel, against $9.60 a barrel at
this time last month, and some whole
salers are selling good grades to gro
cers today at $8.75 a barrel wholesale.
There are plenty of stocks on. hand
and no shortage is looked for in the
near future.
One reason for higher flour prices
this year is furnished In the fact that
for the fiscal year which closed June
30, 1916, exports of flour from the
United States to foreign countries
reached a value of $87,347,805, against
$34,454,175 for the year ending June
30, 1914. before the European war be
gan. Wheat exports for the year ending
June 30, 1916, totalled the huge sum
of $215,532,681, more than double the

Later in the day Reese Llewellyn of
the iron works and the district attor
"id Indication, were that th.
disaster was caused by an accident.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec 1f.A
mytterious and disastrous fire which
the city authorities believe was in
cendiary early today destroyed most
of the big Llewellyn Iron Works plant
in this city, ' -
Two heavy explosions occurred in
the plant simultaneously with the dis
covery of the fire, which attained
headway with such rapidity that It
could not be checked until It had
burned over two squares.
The damage is estimated at $15O,0CO.
The police are investigating to set if
they can trace the incendiaries or dy
namiters, if there were such, - "
The fire in the Llewellyn Iron
Works plant, coming immediately aft
er the ccnvlctkn of David Ca plan on
a manslaughter charge, has a signifi
cant aspect. This plant was blown up
In 1910 by a 'ang of alleged imion
labor dynamiters, including the; Mo;
Namara McManural group. John ' Mc
Namara pleaded guilty t to the dyna
miting and was sentenced to serve 14
years In the penitentiary. "'His broth
er, James, pleaded guilty to murder,
in cennection with the Los Angeles
Times dynamiting and was sentenced
to life imprisonment,. ' ' "
David Caplan Was alleged to he an
associate of the McNamaraa and' of
Ortte McManigalr who turned state's
evidence. Caplan was arrested at
Port Orchard, Wash., five years after
the Los Angeles Times dynamiting.
He was identified as one of the men
wh.o bonght explosives frora a.powdef
works; which explosive was alleged to
have been used on the Times Job. Mc
ManigaL.who testified against the Mc-.
rXamaras, was indicted for dynamiting
the iron works plant So the two Jobs
of dynamiting and the two groups of
men are closely connected by the
events of their trailing . down and
trials. .
