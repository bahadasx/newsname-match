A "forest lire" in the heart of
town liked to have been a serious
matter, when a lady set fire to the
gram on her premises. Quite an ex
citement was caused thereby, and it
all happened last week.
Mayor Badon can now read the
Farmer under his own vine and fig
tree. He has recently purch-ased the
Kline dwelling, and thus far is not
too stuck up to speak to his friends.
The Farmer seems to be the local
Ipaper of Slidell, and just lobs of
people are reading this item.

Our young friend, and all around

Marcel "Cousin, in his Overand

every week, and he will come oftener
after the shells and gravel are Iplaced
thereon.
'A letter from Dr. Outlaw, nc!w f
El Paso, Texas, has been received,
saying that 'he was well, and .als
reads the Farmer every week. Him
