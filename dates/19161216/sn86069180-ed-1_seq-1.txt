(QUACKS MATCH THE EDITORALS
Tal Wlndle, associate editor of
JBrann's Iconoclast, pays his respect
to the Menace and its followers In
tho following broadside, entitled
"Birds of a Feather:"
As a rule it is a safe bet to judge
a paper or magazine by the adver
tising It carries, but I hate to think
that tho Rev. Teddy Walker and
3iIb associates on the Menace are
as disreputable as the ads they run
on its sanctified pages. It is a
well known fact that they are nar-Tow-minded
religious zealots who
have been bitten with tho lust for
money. They havo been trying to
kill two birds with one lie to
strike a blow for that dear religion
of theirs and at tho same time coin
credulity into gold, prejudice Into
silver and ignorance into green
backs. Their golden goose is the
Menace "tho deadliest menace to
free institutions and liberty" in
America today. Rev. Teddy and his
backers are so sincere in their am
bition to destroy the Catholic
church and bo earnest In their de
sire for wealth that they have
stooped to meet both ends.
Tho subscription lists of the
Menace surely must contain a ros
ter of the charter members of the
Fools' Club of America. No person
whoso reasoning ability has devel
'oped past the cave period could be
Induced to read tho Menace reg
ularly. One peek at the advertising
columns would bo enough to damn
it forever with thinking people. The
Menace is supported kept on its
financial feet by a bunch of adver
tisers who have been turned down
and out by every respectable paper
In the country. Only sucker ads
are run in tho Menace. Tho advertising-
managers- of legitimato busi
ness enterprises realize that It
would be a waste of money to ap
peal to the Intellect of readers of
tho Menace and so the advertising
columns of that sheet arc devoted
exclusively to the quacks. These
concerns are shrewd enough to
"know that the Menace is a wonder
ful medium for them, that the
steady reader of tho Menace is. an
A No. 1 prospect tor damaged
Boods. It is the get-rich-qulck firm
and the shady and unsavory medi
cine companies that support the
Menace and make it possible for
the InsUlt to Intelligence to cir
culate. I am not making war on these
-crooked advertisers. It is not nec
essary. They have been driven out
of nearly every other field except
the Menace. This paper is a god
send for them: They realize that
any boob who would fall for tho
Menace would fall for anything and
so they fall all over themselves
lighting for space in it. I love to
cross swords with an intellectual
enemy. It Is a pleasure and a
privilege, but while there Is some
degree of satisfaction in having a
skunk hate you there s no honor
to be gained In open battle. And
so I view with dismay the adver
tising columns of the Menace. They
are filled with quack ads with
fake cures for gallstones, cancer,
piles, ruptures, rheumatism, eczema,
tapeworm and fits all the vast
army of undesirables that have
been chased out of the decent pa
pers of tho country, Ttiese pre
tended cures are tho curse of hu
manity. They raise false hopes in
the breast of despair, prolong the
agony in curable diseases and put
off the day when the sufferer will
go to a real doctor for a real
cure. They are the same menace
to the physical well being of peo
ple that the Menace is to the in
tellect. The editorial columns of the
Menace match the advertising col
umns in Btupidlty, false logic,
punk sophistry, cheap wit and men
dacity. They are hypocritical,
lying, slanderous and get by only
because of the blind prejudice of
certain religious fanatics who
Imagine that they are helping one
church by knocking another. Tho
"P. A. papers and preachers are
like a cheap gang of Ballyhoo art
tlsts at the county fair. Instead
of confining their remarks to the
teauty and perfection and charms
of their own road to heaven they
re trying to boost their railroad
by knocking the other route. I
"have always been suspicious of the
man who had to knock his rival
to get trade and If I were picking
out a religion from the standpoint
-of pure reason I would beware the
jitney-bus line to New Jerusalem
that had to depend upon slander to

The Menace and its followers are
on the wrong track and going in
tho wrong direction. Fortunately,
however, they cdnstltuto a very
small minority of Protestants. Only
the riff raff, the cheap, petty, dog
matic, Ignorant followers of
Protestantism give way to wild,
unreasoning prejudice. The sooner
these peopk) realize that a church
that can prosper only by the de
struction of n rival is doomed to
failure, tho 'better it wllL- be for
true religion. Thoro are so many
persons in the United States who
are not Christians the Held for
Protestant conversions is so large
that It is ridiculous for them to
try and win converts to Love by
appealing .to Hatred.
Instead of fighting among them
selves the religious bodies should
get together If they want to per
petuate Christianity. A majority
of the population of tho United
States is non-religious. Some arc
free thinkers, agnostics, skeptics
and atheists, mado so by the bick
ering and scrapping, intolerance,
and hypocrisy" of orthodox creed's".
The spectacle of Christians falling
out over matters of theology and
politics, over Scriptural interpreta
tions and civil rights, instead of
combining in one solid battle front
to wage war on the Demons' of pov
erty, vice, crime, disease and ignor
ance has turned millions from re

POPE'S EFFORTS , FOR PEACE
i.-i vti'Z?"'' r -
Despite the blustering denials
of the English press tho senthnent
prevails that tho end of the Euro
pean war Is In sight, and the sug
gestion of peace made by Germany
was foreshadowed by the conference
between His Holiness and Cardinal
Francis Bourne, Archbishop of
Westminster, last Saturday. Follow
ing that conference Cardinal Bourne
visited Count do Sails, tho now
British Minister to the Holy See.
Although tho greatest reserve was
maintained by all concerned the
suggestion is mado that Cardinal
Bourne might havo been instructed
to sound the members of the newly
organized British Cabinet, with
whom he Is on excellent relations.
Just a few days after this confer
ence the German suggestion for
peace is given to tho world and
transmitted through tho Vatican.
That the warring powers are at a-
deadlock in tho present struggle
is shown by the stories of tho dif
ferent American correspondents,
among them being William Bayard
Hale, who in an open letter to
President Wilson tells of the futile
struggle and waste of lives now go
ing on. Mr. Hale Is correspondent
of the International News Service,
and wrote an open letter to the
President, his letter being sup
pressed entirely by the English
press censor, although the tolls
were prepaid in New York. A copy
of tho letter was filed with tho
Hague and reached the Interna
tional News Service in this country
by messenger.
In writing of tho Somme battle
field tho correspondent says:
"For men are dying here, Ger
mans, Frenchmen, Englishmen,
dying In holes in the ground, dying
under the trees, dying in stables,
dying in railroad cars sidetracked
in long trains, dying in motor
trucks laboriously seeking their way
back to peace, dying in scores in
cottage, school houses, dying by
hundreds in churches transformed
Into crowded ihospltals, dying lying
in tho dirt, their sightless eyes
rolled up toward a heaven of brass,
files on their lips and In their gap
ing wounds. By thousands on the
dreadful landscape which spreads
Itself before, my eyes as I write
these lines, human beings are
yielding up tho flame of life, and
leaving widows and orphans to won
der whether thero Is a God above.
One knows that men are wounded
In battle, but actually to seo these,
epectres of men Germans, French
men, Englishmen crippled, blind
ed, scarred, deformed, lamed,
maimed, mutilated, that is hard.
"To us here on this bloody field
have come echoes of the ribald ut
terances of Mr. Lloyd George, In
which, in the language of the race
track and the prize-ring, he flings
insult into the -teeth of the Presi
dent of the United States and the
head of Catholic Christendom, the
Pope. It either of them dares to
dream of the day when this war
shall cease. It would be unjust to
the people of England, whose his
tory and literature, whose heart
you know so well; it would be un
fair to the sober-minded statesmen
of uts own land, and more espe
cially to those of Russia, .Franca
and. the Central European, Allies, to
believe that, they recognise in the

the ground: J
"This war Is at 'a standstill. I
have travelled 500 Jtnlles along the
western German lines of defence.

Gibbons:

Before the advent of Christ the
whole world, with the exception of
the secluded Roman province of
Palestine, was burled in Idolatry.
Men worshiped the sun and moon
and stars of heaven. They wor
shiped everything except God only,
to whom alone divine homage is
due. Christ, the Light of the
World, proclaimed unto all men In
Its fullness the truth' which had
hitherto been hidden in Judea. He
taught mankind to know the one
true God, a God existing from
eternity unto eternity, a God who
created all tilings by his wisdom
and whose supenntenaing prov
idence watches over the affairs of
nations as well as of men "witn

Hold Annual Meeting and Hear
Reports of the Year's
Work.
Many Conferences Have Now
Members Aggregated Into
the Society.
Rev. Father Keller Portrays
Beautiful Picture of Catholic
Charity.
FATHER DONOHOE ALSO SPEAKS
- The"chief -evtnt-of-th'oyea'r in
the circle of the St. Vincent de
Paul Societies was the annual meet
ing, at which the reports for the
past year were made by the many
parish conferences, also the com
mittees on special works at the
Juvenile Court, hospitals, sanita
riums, jail, alms-house and other
public Institutions. The meeting
was held Sunday afternoon at tho
Knights of Columbus Hall, where
all the seats were taken and many
were compelled to stand. President
John A. Doyle occupied the chair
and the speakers of the evening
were Rev. Francis Keller, .assistant
pastor of St. Vincent de Paul's
church, and the Spiritual Director,
Rev. Eugene Donohoe, pastor of St.
Paul's church.
When President Doyle rapped for
order the Rev. Father Donohoe of
fered the opening prayer. Nearly
all the conferences reported that
their membership had attended
mass in a body and received holy
communion, some combining with
the Holy Name Society of their par
ishes. After new members of the
various conferences had been ag
gregated Into the society of the
world the .special committees pre
sented their reports, showing ac
tivity and excellent work upon the
part of all. -The City Hospital,
Alms House, Work House, Colored
Hospital, Parental Home and School
of Reform were visited regularly,
and at present tho class at tho lat
ter was the smallest since that
committee had been going there.
Several of tho committees asked
that their number be increased In
order to facilitate their work,
which was greatly appreciated by
the poor and unfortunate
Secretary Thomas Bohan read the
annual report, showing that in
Louisville there were twenty-one
conferences with a membership of
l,23gwhlch is being steadily in
crease During the year $7,000
had been expended for relief of tho
poor of the city, the total expense,
which Included postage, printing
stationery, etc., being only $37. This
shows the effective charity work of
the Vlncentians. The visits or the
various relief committees totaled
2,805, and included 413 families
and assistance for 1,080 needy per
sons. This report was evidence that
the followers of St. Vincent de Paul
were earnest in visiting the poor,
bringing relief and encouragement,
and that their hearts were In this
work.
President Doyle announced that
It was his intention to meet with
all tho conferences, urging them to
make interchange visits, which he
believed would prove interesting
and beneficial. He then introduced
the Rev. Francis Keller as one who
was very close to St. Vincent de
Paul.
Father Keller, who Is an eloquent
and forceful pulpit speaker, began
by saying he would only oxitllne the
history of charity, and then por
trayed a beautiful picture of Cath
olic charity, which extends to all.
The charity of the Jews was great,
he said, hut nothing unto that of
the Gospel and Christianity. The.
charity during the; time of the per
secutions was unsurpassed even
unto thte day. He reviewed the
nerkvfl from thn third .to the aev-
lenth centuries and up to the time
when the monasteries became a
dominant factor in the work of
charity. The middle ages were tho
ago of faith and light, and the
world owes its charity to the Cath
olic church. Father Keller declared
St. Vincent de Paul was the great
est worker in the field of charity
the world has ever known. He also
feelingly referred to the Sisters of
the Good Shepherd and the Little
Sisters of the Poor, who look after
the poor and needy of all classes.
In concluding he commended the
St. Vincent de Paul Society as the
greatest of its kind existing in tho
world today.
Father O'Donohoe congratulated
the Vlncentians on the large attend
ance and their obtaining the special
indulgence. He urged his hearers
to preserve tho spirit of the society
and be present at the quarterly
meetings. With the closing prayer
the meeting adjourned, all feeling
they had been well repaid for the
time given for the cause of charity.
Rev. Father Thome and Rev. Father
Deppen gave encouragement by
their presence and were warmly
greeted on all sides.

Prokihition Will Not Secure
Even the Full Rcpuhlican
Vote In Elections.
Local Republicans Wont Under
taker as Appropriate Selec
tion For Mayor.
DEMOCRATS ANNOUNCE RAPIDLY
'The Republican party In Ken
tucky did not celebrate Thanksgiv
ing day with any great gusto and
are not looking forward to a. happy
Christmas and New Year because
tho political future for tho Republi
can party in this State looks very
dark Indeed. Losing the State and
the nation In the past year was
bad enough, but to havo the party
committed to tho hopeless platform
of prohibition leaves no hope for
victories in the future and may even
mean defeat in the counties and
towns where the G. O. P. had a
working majority. Republicans
high and low are loud In their con
demnation of National Committee
man Hert, the Kentucky Republi
can boss, because of his espousal
of prohibition and his intent to see
the party committee! to it. It was
bad enough that he, a newcomer in
Kentucky politics, should with tho
assistance of the national Republi
can leaders shove aside Col. McCul
loch, Ludlow Petty and others, ob
taining complete control, but to
come along now and ram prohibi
tion down the throat of the entire
party is carrying things pretty high
handed. As a Louisville Republi
can remarked the other day, "What
right has Tobe Hert to come over
here from Indiana and fell us what
our political convictions should
be?" And this remark pretty near
sums up the case after all. The
Republicans in all part3 of the Stato
see dark prospects ahead.
Aside from a political standpoint
prohibition has no chance in Ken
tucky, and the quicker the prohibi
tion question is settled the better
it will be for all concerned. Tho
combined vote of Stanley and Mc
Dermott showed a blg majQrity
over "'McChesneyT' "lTe Prohibition
candidate on the Democratic end,
while the sentiment in the Repub
lican party was so overwhelmingly
against prohibition that Dr. Ben
Bruner, the Republican Prohibition
candidate, was scared off the track
and declined to contest with Mor
row in the primary. Nothing has
transpired since 'that time to en
courage the prohibition clement to
hope for another result, but tho
agitation Is kept up by the preacher
politicians and anti-saloon leaguers,
who calculate they must make a
noise to earn their salary. In this
they are being assisted by Percy
Haly, who is making a vain effort
to come back in Democratic politics,
and the Republicans spoken of
above, who see in prohibition a pos
sible chance to recoup their losses,
but the wise Republican leaders will
have nothing to do with tho move.
That the odds are against prohi
bition in Kentucky is shown in tho
willingness of our trust companies
and laTge real estate holders to
lease property for liquor purposes
with a provision In tho lease calling
for a revoke of the lease if Ken
tucky goes dry.
The gloom of the Republicans la
reflected In the local situation to
such an extent that some of tho
leaders close to the Chllton-SeaTcy
machine say that the party here is
dead or pretty near so. That there
is something in this is conceded by
the Herald, which confesses that
tho Republicans are trying to se
cure John Maas, an undertaker, to
lead the ticket for Mayor, which
seems appropriate, to say the least.
The Herald further adds a possible
list of candidates to accompany Un
dertaker Maas, but failed to specify
whethor they were tp be pall-hearers
or mourners, among them being
Joe Selllgman, Joe Lawton, Henry
Fox and Matt Chilton for County
Attorney; W. E. Ross for Sheriff;
ex-Mayor Grlnstead for Tax Re
ceiver and Richard Menefee for
County Assessor. On account of
the party's espousal of prohibition
many wholesale and Tetall liquor
men heretofore Identified with the
G. O. P. will consistently refuse to
follow the funeral procession.
The Democrats are so encouraged
over the situation that in all
probability every office with the ex
ception possibly of Mayor, County
Attorney and Jailer will have two
or more candidates. Sheriff Cro
nan's candidacy will be unopposed
in thu primary, and the same goes
for County Attorney Bullitt and
Jailer Foster. It Is rumored that
County Judge Greene is still holding
up the appointment of County As
sessor with the posslblo view of
getting strength away from Loralne
Mix, Mark Beauchamp and Tyler
Barnett, othor possible candidates.
Harry Leachman is being mentioned
as a contestant for County Assessor
against Allen Smith. James E.
Dunne Is bbing groomed by some
smart politicians and ward leaders
to enter the race for County 'Cle,rk
against Pres Ray. Charles Mllliken
Is also being mentioned pretty fre
quently for the same office. Thomas

Judge against Judge Boldrick.
