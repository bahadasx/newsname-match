ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
That the racing program at
the Arizona State Pair which
recently closed was a decided
success, is manifested from the
articles in the various journals
throughout the country which
feature horse racing.
Ejectment proceedings have
been started against settlers on
the Baca Float in the United
States district court at Tucson
by Attorney Kingan, repre
senting Waite and Davis, and by
Judge John H. Campbell, repre
senting the Boudin interests
and Welden Bailey.
Notice has been served on the
Clerks of the Superior courts
throughout the state, that parties
holding declarations of intentions
to become citizens that are over
seven year old, will not be
considered and that it will be
necessary for those holding such
certificates to make new declara
tions. James Treahy. formerly foie
man of the bindery department
of the State Consolidated Print
ing and Publishing Company
has succeeded Bradford Duncan
as deputy United States marshal
and says that he likes the job.
Mr. Treahy was a candidate on
the Democratic ticket for repre
sentative in the legislature.
Diamond drilling at the site
chosen for a storage dam on the
Gila river east of Florence has
been begun under direction of
the engineering corps of the U.
S. Indian department. It will
require about two months time
to complete the drilling, which
is preparatory to the construction
of a dam for which congress has
appropriated $250,000.
A recommendation that a
daily scriptural reading from
the Bible, without comment,
be permitted by law in the
public schools, will be made to
the legislature by the supreme
court law committee of the
Arizona Teachers Association,
which met at Tucson Saturday,
to draft a new education law for
Arizona. Tucson Star.
The Cochise county board of
supervisors are preparing to
place up-to date, indestructible
road signs at every crossing and
turnoff on the important roads
in the county. The Borderland
route will be taken care of first
from the New Mexico state line
to the Pima county line, after
which all branches will be
signed. Benson Signal.
The democrats have a right to
feel encouraged. Four years
ago they whipped us with a split
in the republican party which
was not a test of strength. This
year they whipped us straight.
Go to it. A ball game never was
interesting where the score was
36 on one side and nothing on
the other. The closer the con
test the more the interest Buck
eye Valley News.
A baby daughter was born in
El Paso Monday morning to Mr.
and Mrs, Jack Price. The
mother and babe are both re
ported to be doing nicely, while
"Pap" Price has swelled up a
couple of inches around the
cranium. In these modern days
of woman suffrage, and with the
ever-increasing sphere of woman
influence and dictation in world
affairs, it may be only a few
years until parents of male
children will be looked upon
with a feeling almost akin to re
proach. Patagonian.
Salt River valley water users
will pay almost double last year's
rate for water during the period
which began December 1 and
which ends September 30, 1917.
Advices from Washington fixing
the price of irrigation water at a
higher figure than any time since
the completion of the Roosevelt
dam have just been received at
the local offices of the reclama
tion service. The price for the
first acre foot is increased from
fifty cents to $1.00 and addition
al acre feet are increased from
25 to 100 per cent. High cost of
maintenance and damage caused
by floods are said to be respon
sible for the increase in the price
ol water.
In view of the fact that re
cently the national guard of sev
eral states has been relieved
from borderduty and sent home,
it would appear that the Ariz
ona National Guard should re
ceive some attention in this
respect, and several hundred
citizens of Graham county have
signed a Detition, asking that
Safford Company B, First Ariz
ona Infantry, be relieved from
further border duty.
Announcement was recently
made by Dr. R. B. von Klein
Smid, president of the Univer
sity of Arizona, of a new biolo
gical station in the Santa Cata
lina mountains. This station
will be about 25 miles from
Tucsftn, on a section of land
which has been leased by the
university for a period of 30
years.; The work will be under
the direction of Dr. J. J. Thorn
ber, professor of biology and
botany.
Nine lists of land selections
were tiled in the local land office
this morning by the state land
commission as follows: For
university purposes, 7,505.36
acres; normal schools, 1,961.16
acres; payment of principal and
accrued interest on the bonds of
Yavapai, Maricopa. Coconino
and Pima counties, 8,299.18
acres; agricultural and mechan
ical colleges, 3,360 acres; insane
asylum, 3,546.77 acres. Total 24,
675.4 acres.
The phenomenal price of 52.8
cents a pound reached by Ariz
ona grown "Pima Cotton" and
the scarcely less phenomenal
average of 45c. brought by the
Arizona grown "Yuma" variety
has brought the cotton growing
sections of Southern Arizona to
the front as the most remarkable
cotton growing district in the
world. The absence in Arizona
of both the destructive Mexican
cotton boll weevil and the still
more destructive Egyptian Pink
Boll Worm will be as important
factors as any in the future of
this great industry.
The ancient town of Tubac,
scene of a silver mining boom
in the early days of Arizona,
may be depopulated as the re
sult of ejectment proceedings
filed in the federal court yester
day by the heirs to the land
comprised in Baca float No. 3, a
Spanish grant in Santa Cruz
county. Some 87 inhabitants of
the town and settlers in the
vicinity are made defendants by
James E. Bouldin and Helen L.
Bouldin of Kansas City, Mo.,
David Bouldin of Austin Texas,
and Weldon M: Bailey of Cains
ville, Tev., the heirs.
Drift and boundary fences
about the ranges of the Chirica-hua-Coronado
national forest are
being planned for the coming
year by local forestry officials.
The fencing of the ranges by
the local forest is the particular
work being undertaken by the
local forestry officials the pre
sent year. The plans for fenc
ing are being made under the
charge of Hugh M. Bryan, who
was sent here recently to take
charge of this feature of the
work. He made surveys last
summer on the Huachuca and
Santa Rita divisions of the na
tional forest where the first
fences will be built. Other divi
sions will be taken up later. It
is hoped eventually to fence the
whole of the forest reserves.
The benefits to cattlemen will be
many.
One hundred miles north of
Flagstaff is the location where
the Navajo Copper company is
mining. This is one conpany
that is not selling stock. The
people who own the property
are operating it themselves. A
big bin on the sand Mesa, 25
miles from the mines, has been
established. From this point
big auto trucks will haul the
product of the mines to Flag
staff, there to be shipped over
the Santa Fe to El Paso for
smelting. Mining.men who have
visited that section say the Na
vajo project is one of the great
est mining propositions in the
state of Arizona. The quantity
of ore is practically unlimited
and it is rich enough to haul a
hundred miles by auto and then
stand the expense of freight,
leaving a fair margin of profit.
LASTING PEACE DESIRED.
Berlin, Dec. 12 Germany and
her allies today proposed to
enter forthwith into peace ne
gotiations. The propositions which they
will bring forward are, accord
ing to Chancellor Non Beth-mann-Hollweg,
appropriate for
the establishment of a lasting
peace.
The Austrian, Turkish and
Bulgarian governments are mak
ing similar proposals. These
proposals also have been trans
mitted to the Vatican.
The following announcement
was given out today by the
semiofficial Overseas News
Agency:
"The chancellor this morning
received one after another the
representatives of the U. S. of
America and Spain and Switzer
land that is, of the states protect
ing German interests in hostile
countries. The chancellor trans
mitted to them a note and asked
them to bring it to the knowledge
of the hostile governments. The
note will be read today in the
Reichstag by the chancellor.
"In the note the four allied
(Central Powers) propose to
enter forthwith on peace negotia
tions. The propositions which
they bring for such negotiations
are, according to their firm
belief, appropriate for the es
tablishment of a lasting peace.
"The governments at Vienna,
Constantinople and Sofia trans
mitted identical notes and also
communicated with the Holy
See and all neutral powers."
The chancellor addressing the
Reichstag reviewed political
events and discussing the Rum
anian entrance to the war,
said :
"The situation is serious but
with God's help our troops are
shaped and conditioned to give
us security which not only is
complete but more so than ever
before. Our western front stands.
"Despite the Rumanian cam
paign, it fitted us out with larger
reserves of men and material
than formerly. Von Hindenburg
captured the whole western part
of Wallachia and the hostile
capital, Bucharest.
"Great stocks of grain, vi
ctuals, oil and other goods fell
into our hands in Rumania.
Their transport is begun. In
spite of scarcity we could have
lived on our own supplies but
now our safety is beyond
question.
"Heroic deeds of equal im
portance have been done by our
submarines.
"The specter of famine which
our enemies intended to appear
before us, now pursues them
without mercy.
"The empire is not the besieg
ed fortress as adversaries im
agined, but a gigantic, firmly
disciplined ca.jp, with inexh
austible resources."
Eerlin, Dec. 12. The peace
note describes the disastrous
effect of the war on civilization
and humanity and directs atten
tion to the m successes of German
arms.
"In spite of ou consciousness
of military economic strengh,
our readiness to continue the war
(which is forced upon us) until
the bitter end, at same the time
prompted by the desire to avoid
further bloodshed and atrocities
of war, the four allied Teutonic
powers propose to enter forth
with into peace negotiations.
Over 100 ostriches, owned by
Dr. Chandler, are to be butchered
and fed to hogs in the next two
weeks, according to an announce
ment by Lou Ellsworth, man
ager of the Chandler ranch.
The birds are part of a flock of
275 that originally cost the
owners $300 apiece. Owing to
the falling off in the demand for
ostrich feathers, the birds are
now worth only $7 apiece. About
150 have been sold to Yuma
ostrich growers, and the rest
will be fed to the hogs. Dr.
Chandler believes he can make
more money by turning his
ostrich ranch into a cotton planta
tion. Bisbee Review.
NO MIXTURES FOR ROAD RACERS
"All but three of the sixteen
contestants in the recent Douglas
to Phoenix road race took par
ticular pains to secure straight
distilled, all refinery gasoline,
and the winners of first, second
and third places were among the
wise thirteen," said J. E. Balsley
district sales manager of the
Standard Oil Company, yester
day, while discussing the ever
present subject of pure gasoline.
"The lesson to be drawn from
this incident by motorists, is the
fact that practically all of the
contestants carefully avoided
mixtures and doped gas.
"A racing driver is out to win.
He is wise to all the tricks that
make victory more certain, and
he knows that mixtures and
doped gas are unreliable, caua-"
ing loss of power and carburetor
difficulties. They all spoke of
these points before the race, and
I know what kind of fuel they
chose because they filled with
our Red Crown gasoline.
"The winner, C. L. Cord, driv
ing a Paige, was frank enough
to give most of the credit for
his victory to the uniform power
he obtained from our gasoline."
BLESSED ARE THE MERCIFUL.
That the majority of Arizonans
voted at the recent election to do
away with capital punishment is
an endorsement of a humani
tarian and Christian policy for
which Gov. Hunt is most largely
to receive the praise in Arizona
as it has ever been a measure
dear to him and for which he
has most earnestly worked. The
logic behind punishing murder
by murder has very little ground
to stand upon. Should God deal
with all mankind with as little
reason and mercy we would all
be lost beyond hope of redemp
tion. Aside from this to hang
men is foolish as an economic
proposition as a man who would
execute a valuable horse because
it had killed a man would not be
regarded as a modern Salomon.
Life imprisonment is plenty
punishment for man and the
labor of the man is of value to
the state to say uothing of its
proceeds being used to help
those who may have been
deprived of a bread" winner by
his insane procedure. Preacott
Courier.
