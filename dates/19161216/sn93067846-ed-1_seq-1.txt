ONE CHANGE IN CABINET.
GREGORY WILL RESIGN AS AT?
TORNEY GENERAL, WHILE
OTHERS REMAIN.
Possible That linker Will be Shifted
to Department of Justice, and Me
Oormlek sent In to lake Ills Place
as Secretary of War.
Washington, Dec. 11.?Every mem?
ber of President Wilson's cabin jt,
with the possible exception of Attor?
ney General Gregory, is expected to
remain la office after March 4, when
ths president's second term begins,
it was learned definitely today that
all of them have b.isn or will be
asked to keep their posts.
Reports concerning possible resig?
nations have centred chiefly around
Seeestarles MoAdoo. Houston and
Dake". and the attorney general. It
has been taken for granted that Post?
master General Burloeon and 8ecre
farter Lansing. Daniels and Wilson
would remain, and indefinite rumors
that Secretary Red field might wish
to retire to private business were de?
nied some time agr<
Secretary MrAdoo personally denied
that ho had any Intention of lOtiign
lrur. The reports In his cai;e have
been moat persistent.
Regarding Mr. Houston it became
known that ths officials of Washing?
ton university at St. Louis, have ex?
tended his leave of absence as chan?
cellor of that Institution so that he
can continue as bead of the depart?
ment of agriculture. Because of the
Investigations into the high cost A
living and other important work un?
dertaken by Secretary Houston, the
president Is known to consider hi*
continued service In the cabinet as
highly desirable.
Although Secretary Baker has been
credited with a desire to leave* the
cabinet, it is learned that In all like?
lihood be will remain. It is under?
stood, however, that there Is a pos?
sibility that he may be shifted to
frM department of Jnntioe if Mr. Greg?
ory tastet* on rsstimlpf thnt
WfaewOtfc national committee, may
be placed In charge of the war de?
partment.
In the attorney general's case the
reports about his Intentions to resign
have been very circumstantial, and
have been generally accepted by
officials as true, although he has
given no Indications of hU Intentions.
The president has offered Mr. Gregory
a seat on the supreme court once and
should another vacancy occur during
the administration It is thought prob?
able he would bo seriously considered
again.

sities of life and directing that con?
ic res? be petitioned to grant increases
ranging from 10 to 33 1-3 per cent,
to government employes whether in

Mr. Gompers was authorized to ap?
point committees to urge the cause
before congress. The resolutions
agreed to include a scale of In?
creases which will be embodied in
tho plan to be presented. It would
provide 33 L-3 per cent, increases for
those receiving less than $1,000 per
annum; 25 per cent, for those re?

British Officials Pessimistic Concern?

Conditions Otlier Than Those Al?
ready Enunciated by Premier.
i London, Dec. 12.?The foreign of?
fice today informed the Associated
Press that it is unable to discuss the
German peace proposals until the
terms have been received. Mean?
while the attitude of the British gov?
ernment towards possible peace terms
Iremains as frequently enunciated by
the former premier and foreign sec?
retary.
A general note of pessimism pre?
vails in London. One prominent of?
ficial expressed himself to the Asso?
ciated Press today as being very skep
Mlcul that the proposed terms would
>Offer even a basis for negotiations.
? This -official said, however, that the
note was a dramatic coup which
would create interesting developments
the diplomatic situation and pro
e the first official peace overtures
the war. /
A strong current of public senti
tent opposed to the German peneo
was evident in the firot cx
itona available both from public
igb
definite terms and without any word
from high authoritative sources indi
ieating the attitude of the government.
The only information in the press
reports was from Berlin and in the
absence of some tangible official pro?
position, British officials were dis?
posed to maintain reserve. It was
noticeable that the proposal had not
created any profound impression
among the average I^ondonors. There
was little talk in the hotels or other
public places and this discussion was
far less animated than in the recent
ministerial crisis.
Government circles also held aloof
from any discussion, with an evident
desire to learn more of the details be?
fore committing the new administra?
tion to a definite course of action. The
foreign office would make no comment
in the absence of the terms, but said
that the British attitude up to the
present was embodied in the declara?
tions made from time to time by the
former premier und Viscount Grey
and that any new proposals would
have to be considered by al! the en?
tente allies before a definite attitude
was possible.
Those in close association with the
new government took the view that
the proposals would prove entirely
unacceptable, mainly because they
were not likely to touch what the
ruling authorities regard as the most
essential basis of any peace, namely,
such guarantees against German mili?
tarism as will permit England, France
and their allies to demobilize their
vast armies, reduce their enormous
military expenses and return to last?
ing conditions of peace.
Both Premier Lloyd-George and
Mr. Palfour, secretary for foreign af
fairs are slightly ill and this may re?
sult In deferring the announcement of
the plans of the new government ncx1

made it will possibly include reference
