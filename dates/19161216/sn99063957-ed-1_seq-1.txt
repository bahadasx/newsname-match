EFFECTS OF NEW BLOOD
IN CABINETS IS FELT
Say Reception Given Ger
many's Offer Shows Unity
Among Allies
By Ed L. Keen.
(United Prats staff correspondent
London, Dec. lti. First evidences of
ew blood Injected into the British and
French governments through cabinet re
Organization! was seen touay in the ul
timatum to Greece and Fiance's new
Verdun offensive.
Press reports of King Constant iue's
reply to the demands of the allies were
received here today. Every earlier in
dication pointed to his submission which
acceptance of the allies terms will un
doubtedly reflect credit on Lloyd
t.eorge and Briand, justifying the re
cent revolutionary policies of both coun
ties. News from all sources continue to pile
i' the evidence of renewed determina
tion to wage war. Official statements
vliich have recently been drab and col
orless, now reflectnew inspiration and
joy, in much the same tones as they did
back in July, when the big push started.
National questions of biggest import
ance which have been hanging fire for
weeks and mouths are rapidly taking
shape under the more vigorous leader
ship of I.loyd-Oeorge.
Newspapers today all emphasize Gen
eral NiveMe's "push" at Verdun as a
fitting rej)l to the German peace of
fers. The action of the Russian duma re
jecting Germany's peace proposals and
Foreign Minister Provosky's speech
vas received with strong approval in
London. Following, as it does, the
(speech of French Premier Briand before
the chamber of deputies and the tenta
tive declaration of Bonar Law in the
iousc of commons Thursday, it was tak
en as showing the complete unity of the
allies.
It was considered certain the speech
ot Premier I.loyd-George on Tuesday
will bo along the same Hues. The only
question is whether the answer to Ger
uiany will be a flat rejection or a re
jection coupled with some counter sug
gestions. Calls it France's Answer.
I'aris, Dec. 10. France's answer to
Germany i peace proposal is:
Wresting of more than 12 square
miles of territory from the enemy. Cap
ture of more than 1,500 Germans.
Gain of numerous German trenches,
tlie villages of Vaoherauvllle and I.ouve
most, the farms of ChamCiettes and the
fortifications of liaromout and Dezon
vuux. The answer was another one of Gen
eral Nivelle's sudden "pushes" in the
A''rdun sector. The newly created com
mander of Flench armies in the north
and northeast opened his attack yester
day morning and within a few" hours
had again swept away from the enemy
territory which it had taken them
months of sanguinary lighting to ob
tain. It was another stroke such as
Nivelle, then commanding the Verdjn

LOS ANGELES PLANT
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Following Two Small Ex
plosions Fire Spreads
-Loss $500,000
I.os Angeles. Cal.. Bee. 10. Fire,
said by the police and fire department
officials to hnvk been of incendiary
origin early this morning practically
destroyed the plant of the Llewellyn
Iron Works, causing $500,000 damage
to the plant. The plant of the Laeey
Manufacturing company, nearby, to
which tin? flames later spread, was
damaged to the extent of $20,000.
Two explosions preceded the fire ac
cording to the employes, and fifty men
barely escaped fiom the burning
building, so rapidly did the flames
spread.
The Llewellyn plant was partially
wrecked by a bomb explosion in 1010.
The Llewellyn plant employed 500
men. It manufactured steel girders
and other steel fabrications. The
buildings were all frame, structures,
and the machinery of the plant is be
lieved to be nearly all destroyed.
Investigators today learned that the"
fire started in the office of the plant
and spread with great rapidity to all
parts of it. In an instant and before
the fire department arrived the entire
plant of the company was in flames,
cutting off for a few minutes the es
cape of fifty men employed in the
machine shop.
Deadly electric wires broke around
these men and for a time it was feared
they would not be saved.
The bomb which caused the ex
plosion in the plant ia 14U0 was placed
but a short distance from where the
first flames were observed this morn
ing. W. O. Williams, nigV. '..atchman
at the plant, who turned in the. alarm,
informed the police that he heard two
distinct explosions in different parts
of the plant.
David Caplan, convicted of man
slaughter in connection with the Los
Angeles Times dynamiting just twelve
hours before the Llewellyn explosion,
declares no associates of his were in
any way connected with the explosion,
which some ascribed to a demonstration
against Caplan 's conviction.
He declares that any such movement
would cause him irreparable injury.
Today the bodies of the ruined plant
were found to be intact. This dis
uses of the theory that the fire start
ed from a boiler explosion.
''We bavte positively established the
fact that the fire at the Llewellyn Iron
Works starteil in the pattern room and
was incendiary. We think that gaso
line was spread about the plant, judg
ing by the rapidity with which the
flames spread. We do not think that
cither dynamite or glycerine was
used," said Fire Chief Ely.
Deputy District Attorney Woolwine
is working with the police in their ef
fort to ascertaWT the ones responsible
for the explosion and fire.
In 1910, shortly after the Los An
geles Times building was destroyed by
a fire st Sited by a bomb, a bomb was
exploded in an attempt to destroy the
Llewellyn plant. The plajit was part
ly damaged.
The subsequent apprehension and
trial of James B. and John J. Me
Narnara provided a series of sensations
in labor circles and caused the convic
tion and imprisonment of most of the
highest officials of the. International
Iron Workers Union.
The Mc.Vamara brothers confessed
the Ijos Angeles Times and Llewellyn
Iron Works explosions and are now
serving terms in Sun Queiitin prison.
Will Ask New Trial
for David Caplan
Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 16. A motion
for a new trial will be made on behalf
of David Caplan. his attorneys announc
ed today following his conviction yes
terday of manslaughter in connection
with "the Los Angeles Times dynamit
ing in lftlO. Failing ii. this, they will
appeal to the higher courts.
( apian and his attorneys were keen
ly disappointed by the verdict. Cap
lan contends that he is' innocent, but
says he believes the verdict of the jury
should have been murder if the jurors
were convinced of his connection with
the atrocity. ,

Desert Land Board Sets Date
for Hearing Request for
Extension
Because the state desert land board
wished to hear what the water users of
the Central Uregon Irrigation company
had to say regarding the application
of tho officials of the company to the
board to have a bill introduced in con
gress asking an extension of time for

committed 18 years ago at Nome,
.panics roiey, age 00, is in jail here to
day awaiting word by cable from the
Alaska authorities.
Wrinkled of face and with gray
hair, wearing overalls und a tattered
overcoat, Foley walked into police
headquarters last night and addressing
tho desk sergeant said: ''1 guess I'm
what you'd call a murderer, pardner. "
Continuing his story, Foley said:
''You're the first living toul besides
myself who knows it. I ain't never
been suspected, but you're talking
now to the man J.hat shot Diamond
Dutch cold one summer night agout 18
years ago on the old sand bar at. Nome.
My God, pardner, but this line been
preying and eating on my mind all
these long years. Finally today I jest
couldn't, stand it no more so I come
up to this court house to give myself
up.
"I ain't crazy," Foley assured the
officer. "I'm not feeble minded and
I'm not drunk. I told you what 1
done; now take me."

Scercst, an old time Alaskan and de
clared the nnmes jind dates of Foley
were absolutely accurate.

Stock Market Recovers
and Prices Advance
New York, Dec. 16. The New York
Evening Sun financial review today
said:
The upward swing in the stock mar
ket which began in yesterday's late
trading with the improvement in the
speculative position anil better buying
much of which was credited to influ
ential banking interests, was given ad
ditional impetus today by the firm
stand by the Russian premier and Duma
in opposition to Germany's peace over
tures. Advances at the opening ranged
from 1 to 5 points in the industrial lint.
At yesterday's low level, prices were
very attractive to the many in the
street who have plenty of money and
are not averse to spendinjr it in the
acquiring of bargains. The present sit
uation is remarkable in that there are I
all the outward appearances of a near
panic without any of the usual accpttl
pnniments of money stringency or bank
Ing nervousness.
In the first half hour of trading today j
stocks advanced consistently with ex- j
cellent recoveries from the recent I
slumps. The improved buying nm ,
usual week-end settlements, however,!
engendered cross curernts in the second i
hour which operated to cause some f Ine-1
tunlions in prices, but the undertone;
remained strong. ,
Prices moved narrowdy irregular for
the most part in the remainder of thej
session, with the general level ot prices
1 to 2 points above Friday.

VILLA GETTING READY
FOR ANOTHER ATTACK
28,000 Cartridges Received
by Bandit Before Chihua
hua Attack
By Webb Miller.
(United Press staff correspoadent..
El Paso, Texas, Dec. 16 Wbolesote
arrests of Americans and Mexicans here
and at other points along the border
accused of breach of the neutrality laws
in fomenting or aiding the revolution
ary activities of different Mexican fac.
tions, are planned by U. S. secret seiv
ice agents. Members of various revo
lutionary juntas are now under snrveil
ance by this government 's agents, bat
action is held in abeyance pending rati
fication of the American-Mexican me
diation protocol.
One of the clauses of the protocol pro
vides for the deportation of undosiruble
nliens engaged in revolutionary activi
ties. The secret service men have been di
recting their attention since the capture
of Chihuahua City by Villistas, to the
source of part of the ammunition sup
ply used by Villa which was not cap
tured from Mexican government t'orees.
Positive evidence has been obtained
that Villa received 28,000 cartridges tho
night before the fall of the northern
capital. Federal authorities here ke
lieve these came from the American
side of Sie border.
That Villa is disposing his troops for
another important movement was initr
CAted in a'l reports to United States
authorities here today. An employe of
the Babicora ranch arriving here stated
that Quevado's band of Viilistas which
has been holding the town of Bac.hiniva
during the past month, has consolidated
with the Acosta band guarding tho
wounded at Guerrero.
Damaged field pieces and machine
gUUa Captured On Santa Rosa hill in
the attack upon Chihuahua City are be
ing repaired at the machine shops of the
Mexican Northwestern railway.
A large body ot Vilitstas has swung
around Chihuahua City to the south,
cutting communication north of Santa
Rosalia, and the bandits are holding
the latter town.
Many varying reports of bitter jeal
ousy between Qenoral Murgiu and
General Omnia and other Carranxista
commanders, are reaching the border.
At the Mexican consulate here, Mexican
officials state they have- no informa
tion as to whether any active campaign
is under way against Villa.
