The envoy'a visit wns brief. Ho
sought official word confirming this
country's Intention not to supplement
Germany's peacu proposals at this
time. '
While nernstorff refused to talk
about this Government's plan. It Is
known that German authorities are
not discouraged In aiiy way by the
fact that America will not now urge
any suggestions. On the contrary,
they believe President Wilson has
left the way open to net lator, and
henco nro apparently encouraged by
this fact
To Follow V. S. Lend.
Spain and. Switzerland, through
their dlplomatla representatives In
Washington, have advised tho United
States Government that they wilt be
disposed to follow tho lead of the
United States In any action which this
Government may ultimately decide to
take to further tho movement for
peace. '
According to Information received
by The Times from u rcllablo source
It was to convey this Intimation that
tho Spanish umbassador mid tho Swiss

the voice of all neutral nations.
Itecnimo of them assurances It Is
felt that President Wilson' decision
not to mako a proffer of good offlcos
nt this tlmo will not be cmbarrussed
by any different action on tho purt of
one of the other neutrals.
Aivnllcd Turkish Note.
Secretary Lunslng stated toduy his be
lief that tho Indcntlc pcacn proposal of
tho central powers will be forwarded
to tho allies today by tho State De
partment. Seeking to eIvo a reason for the de
lay ho explained that he wished to cm

sequently thought k wlso to await the
urrlval of the Turkish note, which came
late yesterday. In order that compari

Dy this legal action an end probably
Is put to what would have been o causa
olebre In the annals of will cases. Had '

vantageously affected by the war situa
tion and contracts mado for the next
few years guarantee practically double
