U. S. WON'T OFFER
TO MEDIATE NOW
Central Towers' Peace Notes
to Be Sent to Entente
Without Comment.
AWAIT WORD FROM ENGLAND
Cabinet Considers German
Proposal at Three-Hour
Meeting.
WASHINGTON, Don. 13. presi
dent Wilson has decided I hut the
notes of the central powers proposing
u discussion of peace to t ho entente
allies will be cent forward ly the
American roveriiincnl noting as Inter
mediary wit hunt nil accompanying
mediation offer of IIh own. 111! has
nut determined whether any action In
behalf of ponee will be taken later by
the I'nltod States on Its own account,
but is holding Ii I m.H.lf In reailineHH to
nerve In any way pomhIIiIo toward
bringing the waning nations together.
The coin ho to be pursued was made
known tonight alter the president hail
conferred with Secretary Uuising and
afler a prolonged cabinet niectinK. It
was tdnted that the delay In forward
ing the notes to the entente. capitals
was ilue to the fuel that the messages
received from (lerinany, Austria-Hungary
and Turkey, Identical In sub
Hlance, differed slightly in phraseol
ogy an a result of different transla
tion. They probably will be put on
Dip cii 1I i'h tomorrow.
Considered Carefully. -
Since the first note arrived, the one
from Germany, the president and his
closest ltd visits have been absorbed
111 study of the situation created. The
Austrian note followed and the one
from Turkey mine late today, too late
to bo translated for the cabinet meet
ing. Those from iiTinun and Aus
tria have been gone over carefully by
the president and Secretary I .a using
to make certain ot their moaning and
so that they may be sure to properly
represent the intent of the central
now ers.
The fact that the cabinet meeting
today lasted more than three hours
nnd was the most prolonged of the
vear attracted profound attention in
official circles and led to all sorts of
speculation. It was explained aiilAorl
tativelv Inter, however, that the
meeting was devoted largely to con
sideration of ileum tmenlal matters
and hnd been nrolonged heCiiu.se It
wns the first time since the campaign
that all the members had been pres
ent. ,
1iMik to Kntcnte.
In other iiiarters than the White
House it was learned that some word
Indicating the official attitude or the
entente allies- toward the peace pro
posal IS being awaited with the deep
est interest by the American govern
ment. The president will not con
sider injecting the fulled States Into
the situation until he is thoroly fa
miliar with all Its plmses. Secretary
Ionising explaining th delay in trans
mitting the communications of tho
central powers, pointed out that the
German note was translated into Kng
lish bv Charge Grew at llerlln and the
one frijn Austria, by Ambassador
I'enfleld at Vienna, while the Turkish
note canto to the state department
In French. As the communications
wore Intended to be identical the
stale department does not desire to
transmit three different versions, and
when all three are In hand tomorrow
a plan to avoid this will be deter
mined upon.
Suggest Another Plan.
Some officials think it would bo
saler to direct the three American
ambassadors In Heiiin. Vienna and
Constantinople to send on the trxts
handed to them by the respective for
eign offices for transmission in their
original form to the countries named.
Switzerland's action in handing
the German note to Italy without
comment as announced in the Italian
parliament by Foreign.. .Minister Soii
ntn.1. was noted here with interest.
Melinite indication of the attitude
of the entente allies Is expected In
the speech of Mavld l.loyd-Uooi go, the
Jiiillsli prime minister, next Tuesday.
Discusses Disarmament.
Meanwhile the authorized state
moot 'f the German embassy here
that partial disarmament will be one
