WILSON WILL NOT URGE PEACE NOW;
RUSSIA REJECTS GERMANTS OFFER;
FRENCH GAIN TWO MILES AT VERDUN
DUMA UNANIMOUSLY AGAINST
NEGOTIATIONS WITH FOE
London, Dec 15.?The Russian Duma unanimously
passed a ?resolution to-day against the acceptance of the
German ?peace proposals, following a "spirited speech'1 by
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, according to a Reuter
dispatch from Petrograd. The text of the resolution
follows :
The Duma, having heard the statement by the
.Minister of Foreign Affairs, unanimously favors a
categorical refusal by the Allied governments to
enter, under present conditions, into any peace nego?
tiations whatever.
It considers that the German proposals are noth?
ing more than fresh proof of the weakness of the
enemy and a ?hypocritical act, from which the enemy
expect.?! no real success, but by which it seeks to
throw upon others the responsibility for the war and
for what happened (luring it, and to exculpate itself
before public opinion in Germany.
The Duma considers that a premature pean*
would not only be a brief period of calm but would
involve the danger of another bloody war and a re?
newal of the deplorable .sacrifices by the people. It
considers that a lasting peace will be possible only
after a decisive victory ove?" the military *>ower of
the enemy and after definite renunciation by Ger?
many of the aspirations which render her respon?
sible for the world war and for the horrors by which
it has been accompanied.

Last for the present, to identify the
United States with the German peace
' move. To-morrow he will transmit
i tc the Allies th?- German. Austrian
l and Tui ki.-?h peace offers without any
? oarnment or recommendation.
The President still Is ready to ?io
anything h?? botteras might help to
bring about a lasting peace. He does
wo in the Gorman offer, hoxv
, ever, the opportunity he ha? been
-.citing for. nor has he any separate

Thi? statement of his poaitlOfl w.n
made authoritatively to-day and
?erved to clear up the doubt on this
'government's possible participation
ir the German overture?. It was in?
ferred that the President was skep?
tical of the chance? of peace at this
time, and that in any case he would
p.wait the answer of the Allies before
considering action on his own part.
Acting Only at Intermediary
?are was taken to make it clear
t that Mr. Wilson was not committed
to any fixed policy with regard to the
peace question, but that he wanted
1 to be free to act at any time as the
i circumstances might warrant. H?
I is neither for nor against the German
proposal to hold a peace parley, but
is acting for the moment merely as
an intermediary for the exchange of
i rotes between the belligerent powers.
The T'irki'h note reached Wa?hington
late to-day. the Austrian and (lermin
having arrived last night. As th*
I'n.ted S-ate? does not reprr?ert Bul?
