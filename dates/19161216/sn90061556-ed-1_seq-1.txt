OLID SOUTH
The Re-election of President Woodrow Wilson
Can Be Attributed Wholly to the Handicap
of the Southern States Where the
Electoral Vote is Unfairly
Counted.
WILL CONGRESS DO ANYTHING 1
What Is Meant By the Solid South ? And What Must the
Republican Party Do to Regain Control of the Gov
ernment and to Purge the Country of the De
plorable and Unfair Conditions that
Prevail In "Dixie."
A WHOLE NATION AWAITS THE ANSWER
Since Mr. Hughes has conceded the
election of Mr. Wilson It Is time to
discuss how It happened. Among
many things, the solid South is one
of the chief reasons why ur. Wilson
was re-elected. Few people realize
what the solid South means.
First, it meats that eleven states
of the Union have decided that they
will only support one political party
under any and all conditions; that
they will have uniform laws respect
ing the franchise and these laws will
govern the South even though they
nullify the federal Constitution.
Second, that they will not only de
prive the colored race of participation
in national or state e election with
impunity but they will demand the
counting of the colored voters' vote
when it comes to establishing the rep
resentation of these' states in Con
gress and the electoral college.
Third, that they will depend upon
violence, Intimidation and the general
cowardice of its great opponent (the
North) to keep the representation
they desire.
Fourth, that these states will be a
unit in keeping alive certain preju-1
dices and racial hatred so that a uni
form sentiment will pervade all of
them and they in turn will do what
they can to convert the rest of tho
country to their way of thinking.
By the above mentioned policy
every democratic presidential candi
date goes into a presidential election
campaign with these electoral votes
unquestionably in his columns, re
gardless of the issue. Any division of
opinion in tho rest of the states will
easily make the Democrat the winner.
This was Mr. Wilson's chief asset.
The Republican party is responsible
for this state of affairs. It had the
government for fifty years and was in
a position to see to it that no part of
tho country nullified the Constitution.
Because this nullification bore hard
est upon colored people nothing was
done to correct this gigantic wrong.
Tho South is a fixed asset in tho Dem
ocratic party. It is opposed to any
thing the Republican party espouses
even though It be the best for the na
tion. Remember this solid South
was formerly the solid slave-holding
states. Every one of them fought sav
agely to retain slavery. As savagely
they are now fighting to maintain the
political slavery of the colored man.
Just as the rest of the country winked
at slavery till its stench aroused the
nation, so will the stench of political
bondage arouse the nation and the
South will again lose In its unjust
fight.
Can the Republican party come
back? Has it lost Its fundamental
principle justice and liberty to all?
Has a righteous God rejected this
party because it refused to stand up
lor the liberty of the lowliest and sur
rendered to an unfounded prejudice
which has resulted in making Amer
ica the most lawless and brutal coun
try In the world, Russia not excepted?
As a result of its departing from that
which gave it power and victory in
the sixties, the conquered has become
the conqueror and now the. South
scruples at nothing to rivet its ad
vantage upon the whole country.
"The southern rebel is in the sad
dle" and the country is feeling his
hand. Eternal justice recoils against
the foul betrayal of the colored man
by this nation. The Republican party
was and Is the receiver of his strength
and influence. In the Worth the col
ored man gets for his alelglance
broken promises. In the South, dis
franchisement and the shot-gun. His
beloved party gave him over to his
enemy there, so that now he is almost
beyond aid. As a result the Republi
can party Is routed with discordant
notes In almost every state and bitter
jealousies are rankling in many
bosoms. Defeat stares it at every
turn. This party can come back if it
again takes up the burden of the op
pressed and fearlessly fights, for God
will be on its side." Tne one thing
necessary for the Republican party
to win is its uncompromising stand
for the re-enfranchisement of the
colored voter In the South. This Issue
wil win. Tho moment the colored
race Is re-enfranchised, that moment
the great American crime will be
atoned for and every portion of tho
country will be In position to hear
the policies of all parties.
Tho South may hypocritically put
away saloons and rum, but it will
never put away barbarism until it
learns to 'respect the rights of every
man alike regardless of his race. To
bring this about, the solid South must
be broken up, politically. The light
for 1920 will be for the franchise for
all men alike. Men will be asked to
take their stand. TI1I3 may be called
social legislation. This is what we
want. There must bo a conscience in
our politics. Woodrow Wilson re
ceived with happiness the murdered
franchise of the colored voter in the
electoral college, but he was too cow
ardly to Insist upon the South giving
this representation to the colored
voter so that at the polls his wishes
might be registered.
The plain duty of every newspaper
that believes in a square deal is, to
fight for the restoration of the ballot
to every American citizen. Had the
Republican party followed Mr. Lodge
in hla attempts to apply tho Constitu
tion by cutting down the representa
tion of the Souh In congress and he
electoral college because of its unjust
laws withholding the franchise from
colored people and thousands of white
Republicans, there'would not be in the
white house today a Woodrow Wilson.
The Constitution Is very explicit on
this issue. But the Republican party
gave away to Ben Tillman of South
Carolina and Hoke Smith of Georgia,
and a million and a half citizens wero
left to the mercy of Its Implacable po
litical foe Southern democracy. It
will be difficult for the party to come
back without the aid of our people.
The colored race will be less than a
race if It does not take this psycholog
ical moment to obtain its long-sought
blessing. Who will join us In our cru
sade to awaken the American nation
again so that our second freedom may
be made sure? Let us do ustlce to
thje American nation as well as to
our race. (REV.) WM. A. BVRD. "
Its Use and Its Abuse.
-
(Joe E. Hertford.)
A recent editorial in tho columns of
The Sun touching upon this subject
leads us to further consideration of
what is commonly called Negro Folk
lore Music. Just as the Negro him
self has been made a commercial Item
In the American social .budget, so has
his music lore been used and in the
same manner vitiated. t Tho peculiar
traditions of a people are usually held
as a sacred heritage of their own and
should servo as one of the means of
racial unity. To "exploit these tradi
tions for mere, attentions Is bad
enough in itself, but to rob them of
their original fornis and to shape them
Into unrecognizable travesties Is lit
tle less than criminal. Everyone
knows that the modern so-called Jubl
leo songs with their ragtime meas
ures and burlesque phrases are no
more like the originals than Is night
like unto day. The old religious fer
vor expressed In feeling cadences of
sorrow and hope .havo been woven
out of form Into Bacrellglous and un
dignified jingles .written merely to
please "white folks," who apparently
cannot think of a Negro without as
sociating him with a monkey.
Otherwise sedate church choirs are
usually prepared to hurl themselves
Into paroxysms of "coon-lore" jubilee
songs upon the appearance of a white
face at the door. Ne gro schools, also,
are expected to have a supply of the
same stuff constantly on tap to be
used for the softening influence of
bringing back tho dreams of "Dear
grave long ago with her back all scar
red up from the slaver's lash. The
average jubilee road show Is a farce,
pure and simple. Every honest mu-
clan will admit this, is. he is really
honest, and every layman knows it as
well.
To be sure the iriuslc lore of the
raec should bo preserved and kept
fresh In the minds of, both the old and
young of our race, but It ought to be
preserved for Its natural purpose of
race unity and race love rather than
for any artificial purpose of race ca
tering or race degradation.

MOB DEFENDERS.
(By Benj. V. Longdon.)
He who speaks Into the recorder of
a graphaphone and then listens to the
reproduction of his record discovers
that while his voice sounds familiar
enough to his friends It sounds quite
strangely to himself. And many of
us know still less about our actual
characters than about our real voices
..Does any one, for instance, ever
candidly admit that he Is given to
envy or prejudice? Do wo ever ac
knowledge that the success, the pros
perity, the superiority of another, ex
cites within us a feeling of uneasi
ness and discomfort, accompanied by
a desire if not an actual effort, to
mortify and disparage the person in
question? Are we not all willing to
subscribe to tho verdict In which the
world's best men have always con
curred : that envy thrives only In a
low, mean, ungenerous nature; and
that it is, without exception, the most
unprofitable of all sins? Real justice
to all men is so rare and man's in
humanity to man, so common that not
a few men and women, go through life
with scarcely a suspicion and rarely
an avowal that they are at all so mean
and small as their words and actions
frequently proclaim them. They leis
urely read a pen picture In which they
themselves are portrayed to the very
life; but they see nothing familiar In
Its most prominent features and
would Indignantly deny that the char
acters so truthfull ydepicted bears
any resemblance to their own. Such
people are genuine mob defenders.
Like the slimy serpent they shed tho
old skin and put on a new sheath.
But It is the same old garment of
calumny and hatred. And so far
from being "the people" the mob de
fenders are enemies of the people as
sailing the strongest line of defenso
about society. So surely as they win
others Just as surely will lawlessness
and anarchy Increase in this Christian
nation and well may the VUUstas
laugh at our pretentions.
New Organization Progresses.
In these times when the lassitude
and worn out conditions of old line

we can hall with pleasure the pres
ence of the stimulating '-Necro Pro

organization now three weeks old and
threatens to become a real active in

association is well formed. Is in ac
