El Paso, Tex., Dec. 16. A Mexican
courier reached the border yesterday
from Francisco Villa's camp at Creel,
fifty miles west of Minaca in the
Guerrero district of Chihfuahua, with
proposals that Villa would refrain
from the further destruction of for
eign life and property in Mexico on
condition that the United- States
would not interfere, in any way with
his campaign against the Carranza
government. .
' This was officially announced by a
high representative of the govern
ment here after Villa's proposal had
been forwarded to Washington by
telegraph. " : . . " '.
Villa also offered to protect ' all
foreigners and their prosperty from
the raidi of irresponsible bandits, it
wa also stated. This proposal in
cluded all Americans in Mexico, (it
was added.
At the camp where Villa had left
his wounded in the Guerrero district
a number of Carranza wounded were
also being treated by Villa's surgeons
after they had promised to join the
Villa army, the Mexican's report to
government agents stated. Villa had
8,000 well-armed men and 3,000 rifles
in reserve, the courier reported, and
also a number of artillery pieces and
a supply of shells. 4 (

New York, Dec. 16. Alton Brooks
Parker, speaking last night at a meet
ing to protest against "The Enslave
ment, of Belgians," declared that the
protest was on "behalf of helpless hu
manity outraged anew by a return to
methods abandoned hundreds of years
ago and not revived even in the most
savage of the late contests in which
men have been engaged."
After describing the hardships al
ready suffered by the Belgians he
went on to say that to "these must
now be added the systematic carrying
away into distant slavery of many
thousands of workmen none but the
best is wanted without any serious
pretense that it is done for any other
purpose than the benefit of 'their en
emies. -,.
"No official announcements made
of the number of unfortunates, of how
long they will be kept in bondage, or
whether they will ever be freed, or
not. . Some admiration must be con
fessed for the fact that no apologies
are made. There is no claim that the
policy is not opposed to the promises
made or that the laws of nations have
not been violated. Nothing is sa?d in
justification except to assert the law
of necessity and its logic, 'the will, the
power and the determination to put
them into effect' without regard to
right or convention, and apparently
wjthout regard to the protests of
either belligerents or neutrals."
The nrntest of President Wilson
against the action of the Germans, he I
--'v- . I
s.ai$, "we endorse from beginning to
end and further than that we propose
to stand by the president in his effort
to secure the release from bondage of
the deported Belgians."
The sympathy of this country for
the Belgians, he said, "is not based
upon interest, or politics, or desire for
power, or upon either a willingness or
an unwillingness to be drawn into the
maelstrom' of European complications,
tut upon the sufferings of a deeply
wronged people; and so the protests
which . we make here tonight repre
sents the known and easily ascertain
ed sentiment of the people of this
country."
.If war is to be waged, he said, with
the purpose of "making human slav
ery again a part of itj whenever pow
er, dr necessity, or "brutality may dic
tate, it will not make much difference,
in the future of thevworld, whether
provisions are made for the preserva
tion or restoration of peace, as pro
posed or not."
This country, he said, had "joined
the whole world in abolishing slavery
of men because they were black and
we now join the whole world in pro
test against the return to this condi
tion of white men, long after it has
been ahandoned for all men." The
treatment of the Belgians, he said, is
the one urgent world question of the
clay and the advance or the defeat of
armies "has far less influence upon
the future of the world than this one
problem."

(Associated Press)
New York, Dec. 16. A letter from
Colonel Roosevelt was read last night
at the meetjng to protest against the
Belgian deportations. He declared
that "Germany has trampled under
foot every device of international law
for securing the protection of the
weak and the unoffending," and "has
shown an utter disregard of all con
siderations of pity, mercy, humanity
and international morality."
"I earnestly wish you all success In.
your meeting," the colonel wrote,
"and all Americans who are proud of"
the good name of their country and
also have in them the capacity for
generous indignation on behalf of a
foully wronged people, must join in
hearty thanks to you and your asso
ciates. - .
"Germany's campaign of method
ically organized atrocities against the
unhappy Belgian people has culminat
ed in the transplanting of over a hun
dred thousand Belgian men into a
condition of state-slavery in Germany
where their labor is to be used to aid
in the conquest of their fellow-countrymen.
Similar transplantings of
civilian non-combatants, both men and
women, into slavery in Germany,
have already occurred in northern
France.
"This action is paralleled by the
action of the Assyrian conquerors of
Syria and Palestine; but until the
present war broke out it was suppos
ed that such hideous infamies were
effectively checked by the system of
irternational law which has grown up
under modern Christian civilization.
"The outrages committed on our
own people have been sijch as th
United States has never before been
forced to endure, and. have included
the repeated killing of our men, wom
en and children. The sinking of the
Marina and the Chemung the other
day, with the attendant murder of
six Americans, was but the most re
cent in an unbroken chain of injuries
and insults, which by comparison
