to the A. B C Club Tuesday after
noon. The home .ooked very at

bells aid cut f lowers, and made us
realize that the Christmas gnyeties
are beginning.

really missed when they leave for
St. Louis the first of the year.
Dainty refreshments added much
to the enjoyment of the ladies, and
each one declared that they had a
most wonderful time, and we believe
it for each happy face proclaimed it.
