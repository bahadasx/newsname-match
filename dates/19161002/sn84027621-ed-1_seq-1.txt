MEETING OF COUNTY
AGENTS IN GAINESVILLE
(Special to the Star)
Tallahassee, Oct. 2. Having notic
ed a statement to the Times-Union,
published in the Pensacola News, by
Col. Wm. W. Flournoy, chief counsel
for Catts, denying that he apologized
to the supreme court for his client, H.
A. Felkel, the Tallahassee correspond
ent who sent out the story, today is
sued the following signed statement:
"Mr. Flournoy says he did s- not
apologize to the supreme court for
his client.
"After paying a beautiful tribute
to, the court and the machinery of
justice and saying that it was a
pleasure to try a case like this, before
such fair umpires Flournoy said,
'My client has criticized this court.
don't know whether he is ashamed
of it or not, but I am.' What is that
but an apology for his client to the
supreme court ? That is exactly
what Flournoy said last Monday
morning immediately after court
opened. Those are his very words.
Many heard them. I wired the story
all over the state and it was 'played
up,' as it naturally would be. The
next day in the supreme court room
in the presence of several newspaper
men and others during a recess,
Flournoy complained about the
Times-Union headline. I then orally
repeated to Flournoy what he said,
and he admitted that was . what he
said, but said that what he meant was
that he was ashamed that such a feel
ing against the courts existed on ,the
part of the public or any part of it,
and that -he was sorry that Catts or
anybody else felt inclined to criticise
the courts. But that is not what he
said. I quoted what he said, and I
stand by it. Flournoy knows that's
what he said, and he will not tell me
that he did not say it. I am not re
sponsible for what he meant. He also
told me the next day that it was a
fact that he had written Catts a long
letter asking him not to criticise the
court, but wanted to know how
found it out. He said he hadn't told
but twe people about that letter.

R. W. Blacklock, county demonstra

attend the meetings of the agents
from all over the state, to be held
throughout the week, at the state ex

Blacklock said that any farmer or any
layman interested, would be welcomed
at the meetings. Today is organiza
tion day. Tuesday will be general
farming day, .Wednesday live stock,
Thursday club work, Friday horticul
ture and Saturday vegetable day. ,
The schools of Ocala began the sec
ond week's worth with a total enroll
ment of 682 pupils distributed as fol
lows: North Ocala, 65; Ocala primary
sehool, 210; graded and high school,
407. There are 135 pupils in the high
school department, 22 boys and 32
girls in the ninth grade, 10 boys and
20 girls in the tenth grade, eight boys
and 17 girls in the eleventh grade and
14 girls in tie twelfth grade, and one
girl taking an irregular course. The
attendance in the high school is 25
per cent greater than it was the first
week of last year. There are 26 more
pupils than can be accommodated in
tle study hall. This crowded condi
tion necessitated adding another room
and another teacher to the"nigh school
department. With this difficulty set
tled, the high school is now in condi
tion to do better wrork than ever be
fore. The pupils have entered into
the work with a zest that is indicative
of a. very successful year.
For the benefit of, the ladies of
Ocala, a class in home economics will
be organized by Miss Cooper in the
domestic art room Friday afternoon at
2:30 o'clock. The charge for this work
will be $1.50 per month, payable in
advance. The cost of materials which
will not amount to much, will be pro
rated among the members of the class.
Those desiring to take this work
should communicate with Miss Cooper
t once and enroll. Not more than
twenty can be accommodated unless
there are enough for two classes.

Vigorous Denunciation of Policy of
Republicans and Prediction of
. War in Event of their
Victory
(Associated Press)
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 1. In a
vigorous denunciation of the republi
can party yesterday, President Wil
son told a delegation of young demo
crats from New York that "certain
prospects of republican success in No
vember is, that we shall be drawn in
one form or another into th? embroil
ments of the European war."
He declared also that if the repub
licans are victorious that the force of
the United States will be used to pro
duce in Mexico the kind of law and
order which some investors in Mexico
consider most to their advantage.
President Wilson yesterday made his
first out and out political speech.
In discussing foreign relations the
president declared that foreign offi
cials would watch the coming election
close in order to know how to treat
the United States in the future. The
foreign affairs of America, he said,
were being embarrassed by the par
tisan treatment of them by the repub
licans. The president made a bid for
the progressive vote by praising the
progressives, and saying that the
democrats had done things they want
ed done.
In attacking the attitude of the re
publicans on the domestic question,
the president insisted that "special
interests" were backing the republi
cans. He said; "until the present ad
ministration came into power, trade
was controlled by Wall street.1' He
said the democrats had driven that
corrupt lobby from Washington.
The latest acquisition to the Flor
idaida' regiment which left this after
noon for the Mexican border is Mr.
Rae Ferguson. He left Ocala a few
days ago ostensibly for a visit tothe
boys at Black Point and while there
he was offered a position as steno
grapher fo one of the members of
the regimental staff at an attractive
salary with the result that he enlist
ed and accompanied the boys. '
BOUGHT A SECOND MAXWELL
Mr. Jake Brown today bought an
other Maxwell car, this time a tour
ing car, from Carroll's Maxwell
agency, and Mr. Brown' traveling
salesman, Mr. Si Perkins, started out
on his rounds with the new car. Mr.
Perkins has driven a Maxwell road
ster for nine months and made 20,000
miles in it, but finds that the touring
car, with the additional room and no
appreciable increasa in weight, will
be better for his purposes. Mr. Per
kins says he will "tell the world" that
his Maxwell will output any four
cylinder car made, and no sand in the
state of Florida has any terrors for
him.

nolia St. tf.
Saturday morning last, when the
Globe Store, owned and managed by
J. Malever, threw open its doors to
the public, it not only marked the
beginning of that firm's big Reduc
tion Sale, but a new epoch in price
cutting in the city.
This firm, as it has advertised for
sometime, is on the eve of retiring
from the general mercantile business
and centering its entire energy upon
shoes running a strictly shoe store.
To enter upon this new enterprise
the management was confronted with
the proposition of getting the use of
the entire store, which was heavily
stocked with new and seasonable mer
chandise. After much deliberation
it was decided that the quickest
way to do that was to throw the en
tire stock upon the market at prices
which had never been put before the
public of Ocala and Marion county
before, hence this great Reduction
Sale.
To say that the opening day was
a success is putting it mild, for all
day long a steady stream of "bargain
hunters" beseiged the store, and the
efficient corps of clerks, which was
thought to be large enough to handle
the throng, was taxed to its utmost
to care for the shoppers.
There are bargains galore and at
such prices everyone should take ad
vantage of such an opportunity for
quoting the manager, "everything in
the store must go for I am not going
to handle anything but shoes in the
future."

Washington, Oct. 1. Increasing
agitation in Germany for a complete
resumption of submarine warfare,
Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg's
declaration before the Reichstag that
any statesman failing to use Ger
many's every weapon to shorten the
war "deserves to be hanged" and the
recent apparently inspired simultan
eous publication in German papers of
attacks on American neutrality has
brought forth an authoritative state
ment ;from the state department on
the American government's attitude
towards the situation.
Any" action which endangers Amer
ican lives through the sinking of ships
without warning or by failing to pro
vide proper safeguards, it was em
phatically asserted, will immediately
reopen the submarine question, but as
yet there has been absolutely no indi
cation in the official advices, to the de
partment that Germany has violated
the agreement arrived at in the Sus
sex case. Reports of the sinking of
nearly 300 merchant ships since June
1, have been received officially, but in
no case has it been proved that Am
erican lives were endangered.
Emphatic denials that Germany
has any intention of reopening a re
lentless campaign of submarine war
fare are contained in confidential ad
vices from Berlan to diplomatic Quar
ters here.

Is the Record of the Knitting Mills
that Have Grown from one Machine
to . Big Factory in Less than Two
Years in Ocala.
The Ocala Knitting and Manufac
turing company is considering an in
crease in its capital stock from $50,
000 to $100,000, and an increase in its
plant that will cover the spinning of
yarn, now imported from Georgia, the
Kianufc-ctuiing cf shipping boxes, and
the dyeing of undergarments. Offers
to increase the capital stock have
come from Jacksonville and New
York, and work on the additions to
the plant may start at any time. This
information was obtained this morn
ing ficm George Giles, president of
the company, and Harry Booth, gen
eral manager.
Since its organization about a year
ago, the success of the Ocala Knit
ting and Manufacturing company has
been remarkable, and this success has
been given wide publicity. It is re
ported that knitting mills, similar to
the one here, will be established in
Tampa and Jacksonville. About 18
months ago the idea of establishing a
knitting mill here, originating with
George Giles, was given publicity by
the Star. A single knitting machine
was installed in the second story of
the ginnery of George Giles and com
pany. Shortly after that George
Giles and company put four knitting
machines and nine sewing machines in
operation, in the small one-story
building on South Main street, em
ploying 12 persons. In July of lafet
year the Ocala Knitting & Manufac
turing company was organized with a
capital stock of $50,000, all local
money, with $10 the par value of a
share. On Jan. 1, of this year, when
the" stockholders met, a semi-annual
dividend of five per cent was declared,
and the par value of the stock raised
from $10 to $15, an increase of 50 per
cent. The knitting- machines in the
little building on South Main street
had been increased to seven, the sew
ing machines to 16, and the number
of .employes from 12 to 25 or more.
In March of this year work was
started on the three-story brick build-,
ing on the corner of , Main and Third
streets, to cost about $12,000. ', This
building is about 50 by 75 feet, and
so constructed that two additional
stories-can be added if necessary. The
plant, now in operation, is equipped
with the most modern machinery, and
is turning out 175 to 200 dozen boy's
and misses' cotton union suits a day.
No undergarments for adults are
made. The sizes made run from two
to 16 years, and at present in six
s yle3. The styles are to be cut down
to four. No two-piece garments are
made. All are union suits.
The number of employes in the new
plant is 80, of which about 72 are
women. The machines are operated
with motors, for which current is fur
nished by the city electric plant. The
manufacturing is done on the two up
per floors of the building, and the
basement is used as a storage.
The making of the products of the
plant is an interesting process. The
knitting is the first step in the manu
facture. There are 18 knitting ma-
ines, and the knitted material
ccmcs from the machines in long
roll3. The rolls are taken to the
fleecing machines, two in number, and
the fleece removed. After fleecing the
rcll goes to the cutters." The cutting
is now done by hand. A machine to
do the cutting will soon be installed.
Alter the garments are cut they are
seamed on the 20 sewing machines.
The garments then go to the facing
machines, numbering four; to the
sheering machines, numbering two; to
the lace work and collarette machine,
cf which there are four; to four ma
chines which tack the fronts; to three
buttonhole machines, and to two but
ton machines. The garments are then
trimmed by hand, tape put in, but
toned up, pressed, folded and boxed
for shipment. Besides the cutting
machines, a cloth rolling machine is
to be installed shortly.
The waste material from the plant
is shipped to New York state, wher
it is used in manufacturing shoddy,
mattresses and paper. .
According to Mr. Booth, the pro
posed spinning plant will cost in the
neighborhood of $50,000. A . single
story building, about 100x175 feet,
will b,e necessary, and the equipment
vrill cost about $38,000. It will take
about 2000 spindles to furnish yam
for the present knitting capacity of
the plant. The spinning plant would
give employment to about 100 hands.
The proposed box plant would require
a building 50x75 feet, with equipment
costing about $3,500. Thi3 department
would employ from eight to ten per
sons. The dye plant would be in a
