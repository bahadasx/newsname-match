COLLISION
OF BUICKS
IN CITY
Boy Driving Father's Car Collides With
Car of F. L. Slusher Driven by
' ' W. P. Brown
In a badly crippled condition, a
comparatively new Buick. touring
car belonging to F. L. Slusher reposes
in a garage inspiring exclamations of
surprise that no one was hurt in the
smashup.
The accident occurred near the cor
ner of Thirteenth and Kansas avenue
yesterday morning while W. P. Brown
was driving the car to Mr. Blusher's
residence at No. 1221 Kansas avenue
and .vas slowing up to make the stop.
Whi.e vet within a few feet of his designation
he was crashed into by anoth
er new Buick 'touring car owned by J.
H. Griffin and driven by the latter's
son Jack. It is claimed by the only
eye witness beside the participants
that the boy was driving at a furious
speed when the accident occurred.
Miraculously, both drivers escaped
injury.
Mr. Slusher's Statement,
Regarding the accident F, L. Slush
er said, "I came out of my house just
as; Jack Griffin whizzed Jy and I re
marked at the time that he must be
going 45 miles an hour. Mr. Brown
said he saw the Griffin car approach
ing just as ho was making the turn in
to Kansas avenue and that ho didn't
have time to get out of the way. He
said he was going about five or six
miles and hour ebcause 7 had to stop
in front of my house about 100 feet
from the corner. As nearly as he could
idge the Griffin car was going about
45 miles an hour. I can't estimate the
damage to my car. I saw where the
Griffin' car had skidded 47 steps after
the brake was set."
. J. H. Griffin's Statement.
J. H. Griffin made the following
statement:
"We sent Jack to town for the car.
He was coming home on Kansas ave
nue. I don't know how fast he was
going but he was going tolerably fast.
Mr. Brown was bringing Mr. Slusher's
car to his home, going south on 13th :
street. Jack saw him quite a while
before he reached the corner. Jack
put on his brake to stop his car. -,;r.
Brown apparently paid no attention
to him, but ran rigt. ;u front of him
and iu order to avoid hitting the Slush
er car square in the side Jack turned
south down 13th street, both cars strik
ing on the quarter, Mr. Slusher's car
running into a tree. Had Mr. Brown
used the proper caution he could have
turned west on Kansas and avoided
the accident, but he apparently lost
his head. Mr. Slusher's car was dam
aged to the approximate amount of
;;00 and mine $25. The bodies and
vital parts of the cars are intact, noth
ing being hurt except fenders, running
hoards and one wheel. Both cars came
to town under their own power."

IN FIRST HALF
i
Oklahoma City is Seven Times Within l? e
Chickasha Ten Yard Line But is
Held for Downs and Loses Ball
Chickasha, in the Initial game of th
football season, held down the Okla
homa City high aehool hoys to a tie
score.
The Oklahoma. City squad entertain
ed tho Chickasha football team on the
former's lot Saturday afternoon. Tha
weather was perfect and tho boys wera
iu splendid trim. When, at 4 o'clock,
a, shrill whistle served as the signal
to begin, a team on one end of tho
field moved as if by magic, while the
Chickasha team on the other end im
patiently awaited the arrival of the.
pigskin. It came. There was a rush,
wild yells filled the air and the run
ner was downed. The ball was not
held long, ' however, as the visitors
were, unable to tuukn the score.
Only the lack of a player w ho could
kick to some advantage from drop or
placement, prevented tlx Oklahoma
City boys from winning, for ,, three
times in the first half and four times
In the second fcalj wre the City, boys
within the visitors' ten yard line. But.
in every such cane tha Chickasha boys
braced up, fought bravely and likn
veterans, and held their opponents for
downs.
Then would come a kick, a wild rush
and the fight would once more ho re-.'.-umed.
All of tho Oklahoma scoring was
done In the first half. Chickasha fum
bles resulted badly. Gootting fumbled
the first iss behind lihia line, and
Hardy fell upon it for a touchdown.
Tyler kicked goal. Only a few min
utes later Swatek charged the Chicka.
sha lino of defemse, gained tuij point,
and made the second touchdown. Thin
time, Tyler missed goal.
In the second period of tlio fii'Mt half
Goctting went through for a Chickasha
touchdown. Hojvevcr, the klck-ont
failed, and thus the first half ended:
Oklahoma City 1.1, Chickasha 6.
Very young indeed was the second
half when "Dutch" Hill shot off tackle,
evaded the first and second line of
defen.se, and raced fiity-five yards to
Chickasha's second touchdown. "Good
old Ch,nk" Goetting, controlling him
self perfectly, got the ball between
the goal pasts and tied the score.
Practically al! the rest of the game
was played in Chickasha territory.
Four times the ball was almost to th
goal, but at such times Chickasha high
sc hool gave a good account of itself as
the boys always braced up and held.
There was strong moral support and
loyal rooting given by the home guard
who yelled long and loud from begin
ning to end, and this doubtless inspir
ed the boys to put forth their best ef
forts. There? was a fine attendance
from this place.
