The dairymen's1 representatives claim
that they formed merely a co-operative
organization and that the "Big

And as it is Albany authorities started
probing both questions. The grown-

As Greece enters the war ex-Premier Venizelos takes his place as the

Lancaster,. Ohio, Oct. S.--Xever
willing to be separated in life, three I
spinsters, two of them sisters, lie to
gether in death today in the "Old
Smetters mansion." The three women
were found dead sitting in rocking
chairs in the mansion s living room.
They are the Misses Alice and Agnes
Smetters, 54 and 4S years old, and
Miss Mary Stretton, 30, a neighbor
and bosom friends.
The viscera of the three women
were today sent to the state depart
ment for chemical examinations.
Authorities were impressed today by
the theory that the three friends
might have entered into a suicide pact,
fearing that some agency as yet un
known to their friends might separate
them.
Misses Agnes and Alice steadfastly
refused offers in marriage in their
younger days fearing that marriage
would mean a separation. They were
bosom friends to Miss Stretton. The
Smetters fortune had gradually wasted
away until Agnes was forced to seek
cmplos'ment.

The average price of this gas at the

While Gorgonio Guerrez slept Sat
urday night and dreamed of Mexican
revolutions, chili and hot tamales, Pe
dro Fransto circled around the Gutier
rez home down on the East side and at
a signal was joined by Gutierrez's
wife and three little children. While
Gutierrez slept peacefully, the caval
cade marched thru alleys and dark
streets to the river bank and made a
temporary camp there.
That was near midnight. Sunday
morning Gutierrez awakened because
of the extreme quiet. There were no
crying children and scolding wife.
He sat up in bed, rubbed his eyes
and wondered what had happened.
Then he yelled for his wife. No ans
wer. He called the children. All he
got back was a weak echo.
Gutierrez sprang out f bed and
reached for his trousers. He caught
a handful of air. He looked for his
shoes. They were gone also. Not only
were the clothes he had been wearing
on Saturday missing, but his Sunday
wardrobe as well. All he had left was
the shirt he was wearing. He wanted
to get outside and search for his wife
and children, but could only peer out
of the windows.
Later in the day Gutierrez summon
ed fellow Mexicans and they fitted
him ont with clothing. Then he
reported to the police that his whole
family and all his .clothing was gone '
only, Gutierrez put it in reverse order
all his clothing and nis family.
Augustin Alba, plain clothes man, i
was put on the case. He made a trip
down into little Mexico and was led
from one point to another by fake re
ports about a fight. He concluded the
Mexicans were trying to hide some
thing from him and settled down for
the day among them.
He Got Tip.
Late Sunday night he received a tip
that a Mexican couple and three little
children were at the Santa Fe depot.
He waited until No. 17 pulled in, then
watched the five board it. Just be
fore the train was ready to pull out
Alba confronted the couple and ad
vised "them -to get off. He told them
the officials had all tne evidence that
was needed and that while he had no
warrant for them, he would get it and
have them taken from the train at th.9
next station.
"Let's get off," said the woman,
"they'll get us anyway."
They left the train and were locked
up in the city jail. The injured hus
band was at the police station today,
and Alba says a warrant charging
"white slavery" will be asked for.
Alba talked with Fransto following the
arrest and obtained his story.
According to the official, . Mrs.
Gutierrez left her husband in bed
about midnight, dressed the children,
wrapped up all of her husband's
clothes and carried them all outside.
There she was joined by Fransto. They
journeyed to a clump of brush on the
river bank and spent all Sunday.
Fransto had apparently prepared
for the elopement. He had two Santa
Fe passes in his possession when ar
rested. One was for himself and the
other for "Sabina Sabala, a dependent
sister, and a dependent nephew."- One
of the children was old enough to re
quire a ticket.
All the tickets read ''Galveston and
return."
Mrs. Gutierrez is twenty-one years
old.
PASTOR DEFIANT
"Hot Shot" Johnston Organizes
Xew Gospel.
Three Lose Jobs Expounding
It in Pulpit.
Baltimore, Oct. 2. The Rev. Mer
cer Green Johnston who resigned the
pastorate of Holy Trinity church,
Newark, N. J., rather than preach to
please the sinners, arrived here today
"to organize a fellowship of clergy
who shall fight for freedom and
preach the gospel of social righteous
ness." "My vestrymen wanted me to run
my church like a grocery store to
please the customers." said the Rev.
Mr. Johnston, and I couldn't quite
do it. I turned loose some real re
ligion. The church wanted the con
ventional and it objected. I imagine
this element in the vestry represents
the real desire of the congregation
for 'brilliant piffle," as I have heard it
described. A phonograph and a few
well chosen records could deliver the
kind of religion they want. Then, too,
one can control a phonograph with a
touch of the hand."
It's Straight From Shoulder Kind.
.The idea of preaching "straight
from the shoulder religion," came to
the Rev. Mr. Johnston prior to 1914
when he with Richard Wallace Hogue,
the Rev. A. W. Arundel of St. George,
New York, and a dozen others delib
erately planned to preach twentieth
century religion from the Episcopal
pulpit and take what consequences
were coming. Mr. Hogue left his
church and Dr. Arundel resigned from
Trinity Pittsburg in 1913.
The Rev. Mr. Johnston will be asso
ciated with Hogue in his work in Bal
timore. It is possible that he may take
another parish but only on a warm in
vitation from all members and with
the frank understanding that he will
speak his thoughts without limitation
from the church members, .

Dr. Young today said he had re
ceived no official notice of the ad
vancement to the St. louis pulpit.
However, an investigation of the re
port here resulted in its being offi
cially confirmed.
Following confirmation of Doctor
Young's transfer it was also an
nounced that Dr. E. J. Kulp, formerly
in Camden, X. J., and now in the pul
pit of the Linwood Boulevard Metho
dist Episcopal church in Kansas City,
has been transferred to theKansas con
ference. That was also done at the
Warrensburg conference by Bishop
Quavle. Doctor Kulp w,ill come here
to fill the pulpit of the First church
without question, prominent Topeka
Methodists assert.
Dr. Young has been pastor of the
First church here for nearly three
years. He succeeds Dr. Frank Love
land who went to Portland, Ore., from
here.
Prominent members of the church
today said Dr. Young was one of the
best pastors that has ever stood in the
pulpit of the church. The records
show that he has brought into the
church by letter and on probation 4S2
members; received into the church
from probation 99, making a total of
531.
The First Church 's one of the
wealthiest of its denomination in Kan
sas and is acknowledged as the pre
mier Me'hodist church of the state.

Toneka in 1914. and a good sized
' crowd assembled at tne station.

leaders of the Republican party, and

START PLAY IN BOSTON
Bcanvillc Very Likely to Cict Opener
of the World Series.
New York, Oct. 2. It appears al
most certain that the opening games
of the world series wiil be played at .
Braves Field in Boston, beginning:
October 6 or 7. The suggestion has
been made that the formality of toss
ing a coin for the privilege of staging
the contests be dispensed with and the
first two games awarded to the Bos
ton Americans. The suggestion is put
forward by the officials of the latter
club and the National league ciub
, owners are considering the proposi
tion.
Braves Field Is ready for the open
ing games, while neither the Brooklyn
nor Philadelphia National league cluh
is justified, in view of the closeness of
the National league pennant race, in
installing additional stands and boxes
until it is settled which ot the two
clubs will meet the winner of the
American league pennant.
