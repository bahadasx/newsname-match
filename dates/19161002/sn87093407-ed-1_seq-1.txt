SEATTLE SEES THIS SPEEDER
THINGS TO EAT COST MORLMRE
The recoil on war prosperity i* hitting Mr. and Mrs, Seattle in the
solar plexus thru a steady rise in prices of necessities, revealed Monday, ami there
were few indications <>f a fall in the cost of living as winter comes on.
Many milkmen, for instance, left tender little message# with their customers
Sunday morning.
"Milk will l>e 10 cents straight, |>er quart." they rend, "and the 12 quarts for
$1 rate will he discontinued. A rate of 11 quarts for $! will apply only to two-quarts
a-day customer*,"
This, it was predicted, will affect almost everybody.
It was also announced that daylight deliveries will *tart Thursday, following an
agreement between the union milkmen and their employers.
Their Injurs will be from 7 a. m. until 5 p. m.
About 45,0(J0 homes are affected.
Oood eggs are now 50 cents a
doien and soon egg stains on one's
vest will he a mark of opulence.
"Of course It's too high," one re
taller told The Star Monday. "But
feed has gone up so high, diu to
Increased asportation of grain, that
chloken men «re killing their
pullets. There aren't so many

Hence the decreuse In supply, and
the resulting rise In price."

80 PER CENT
VOTE TO CALL
OFF DOCK WAR
Only awaiting the final count of a vote taken by
striking longshoremen Sunday, a settlement of the
long-drawn-out strike on Seattle's water front seemed
certain Monday.
The vote was taken on a proposition to return to
work "at the present wage schedule, and after 10 days,
ihe question of wages is to be arbitrated. It is said
that from 75 to 80 per cent of the strikers have accepted
this plan.
The following statement was issued Monday noon
by William Blackman, United States commissioner of
mediation and conciliation, and Henry M. White, United
States commissioner of immigration, who also is a me
diator in the strike:
"The only question which the
longshoremen are now considering
Is whether they will call the strike
off and return to work under the
wages and conditions now In ex
istence, and after 10 working days
the question of wages ran be arbi
trated by the men employed
"The question of 55 cents per
hour straight time and cents
per hour overtime It not consid
ered."
Should the men return lo work—
and they are expected to do rn with
in 24 hours—they will receive the
present rate of 40 cent* and 50
rents an hour for straight time and
•0 cents and 75 renta for overtime.
As employes of the dock owners
they will. then, m 10 days, nego
tiate for a new scale under an arbi
tration arrangement.
t Dm statement issued MoM&y t>y
the mediators has the approval of
( apt. Ulheon. head of the dock
owners' association, and of repre
sentatives of the strikers.
Beyond the brief statement none
of the men Interested would ssy
anything for publication.
International President OVon
nor. of the longshoremen's
union. Is due to arrive Tuesday,
and Secretary Madsen of the local
union Monday refused to say that
the negotiations for strike settl«
nient would either await O'Connor
or would not await him.
The evident conclusion of peace
on the water front follows se>eral
conferences held by the mediators
In the past few days with represen
tatives of both sides. A special
labor union committee, consisting
of Councilman llesketh, BUI Shorts
of the miner*, and IHin McKUlop of
the ship workers actively partici

The strikers met at their hall
Sunday, to discuss the proposition
