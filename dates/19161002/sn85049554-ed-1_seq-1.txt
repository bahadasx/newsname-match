NO JUSTICE IN COAL BOOST.

experts see no economic reason for the
present advance in prices of anthracite
or bituminous coal. They are in

BY BRITISH, QUNS
Falls to Earth and Entire Crew Is In
cinerated—8«oond Zeppelin Is Driven
Off Ten German Airships Make
Raid on English Towns—Drop Bombs
But Fail to inflict Great Damage—
Fourth Zeppelin Raid in Month.
London, Oct 2.—Ten Zeppelins took
part In last night's "raid over England.
Two attempted to attack London, One
was driven away and the other de
stroyed. The statement follows:
"Ten alrshiips crossed the east
coast last night. One Zeppelin ap
proached London at about 10 p. m. She
was' driven off and. when she at
tempted to return from the northwest
she was brought to earth in flames
near Potter's Bar shortly before mid
night.
"A second airship attempted to at
tack London. from the northeast and
was driven oft. Bombs
were"~dropped.
No reports at casualties and damage
have been received.
"The ither Invaders wandered aim
lessly over eastern counties. Over Lin
colnshire bombs were dropped, most of
thejm in open country, without doing
damage."
Friends of Count ^eppelln were
alarmed that another "airship had
been brought down in England last
night, says a dispatch from Amster
dam. The count intended to take part
in the raid, but a message sent to
Germany elicited the information that
at the last moment, owing to the per
suasion of his family, he decided not
to Join the raiders.
Crew Incinerated.
Except for part of the envelope
there (s left hardly a vestige recogniz
able as -part of the huge airship which
Was brought down last night near
Potter's Bar. The Zeppeli burned
more fiercely than the one previously
destroyed, which, like her, fortunately
fell in an open Held. The members of
•the crew were Incinerated and the
bodies scattered over the field on
which the airship alighted, some
eighty yards from a. farmer's cottage.
The Zeppefiln appeared.^r'remaln^al
moBt three minutes in the air after the
^flames *hurs'f rafth.'"' The tongues "of
Are ieemed to lick ofong the bag untir
it was all- ablaze. The burning was so
slow, however, that many who were
awakened by the cheering which
aroused them, reached windows in
time to see it faH
Little or no damage was done by
either of the machines, or by the eight
others operating over eastern coun
ties.
Four Raids in Month.
Four Zeppelin-- raids on London
and on the east coast have ibeen car
ried out In the last month, the more
recent attacks being made by air
ships of the newer and bigger type.
On Sept. 2 one Zeppelin was strucK
while flying over the London dis
trict and fell In flames.
Two Zeppelins were destroyed in
the raid of Sept. 23, On that occa
sion the raiders killed thirty-eight
persons and wounded 125. The fol
lowing night tn another raid, in
which the airships apparently es
caped without damage, they killed
thirty-six persons and wounded
twenty-seven.
In the raid of Sept. 2 only two per
sons suffered death and thirteen were
injured. ..
Recall Count's Threat.
The attack last night recalls to Eng
land the threat made last week by
Count Zeppelin that he would con
tinue sending the aerial Invaders
against the British capital, and that
If necessary he would send them by
hundreds and blow London off the
face of the globe.
London, however, points' to the
fact that a number of the raiAera
have been brought down and that
with the feallng of two of the craft last
week, the destruction of the crew
of one, the capture of the crew of the
other and the reported loss of an
other monster.Jast night, and feels
no need to fear the count's promise.
Twelve craft took part In the ra^5
last iSunday night and were forced to
flee when attacked by aeroplanes.
Strong anti-aircraft guns had been
placed for the defense of the city and
quick work was done when the aerial
fleet waSj signed la$£ Sunday night.
