INCREASE OF
ACREAGE OF,
BEETS
Subject Discussed by Com
mercial Club at Its Weekly
Luncheon Was of Getting
larger Plantings; in 1917
How beat to render kid In adding
to too acreage to be planted to sugar
beets for the crop of next year was
the subject that wai up for discus
lun at the weekly Monday noon
luncheon at the Commercial club.
Oeo. C, Sabln, who waa cbaldman of
the- committee that rendered auch
effective service during the, Initial
campaign for acreage previous to the
location of the factory, waa the first
speaker. He Impressed the thought
thai of all the work that had ever
neon before the Commercial club that
of proper aupport for the sugar fac
tory waa moat Important, Just as the
bringing of the factory Itself was the
most notable achievement.
Alex Hood, speaking from the
farmer's point of view, said that the
(rowers of beets In his district were
11 satisfied and that there would be
material Increases In acreage nest
season. He said that a loading sta
tion should be built In the district
Just west, of town, and that a more
extensive Irrigation .system there
would have the effcet of causing a
larger acreage,
' Clarence Wlnetrout favored the
formation of committees to whom
would be assigned, certain districts to
cover In the campaign for acreage
this winter, and as campaign ma
terial he wanted data obtained upon
the fields of beets now, grown under
proper conditions, showing the
profits made as compared with other
crops. He said that there were some
of the best beets ever grown now
ripening In the district, though, nn
fortunately, some fields planted with
out proper preparation of the soil
and without Irrigation, which had
Toeen abandoned radically from the
Jay of planting, occupied prominent
places along the highway and had
been a bad advertisement.
E. II. Rltfhard compared the mak
ing of sugar 'from cane, aa In the
south, and, from beets, and showed
low the comparison all favored the
beet. But t that, the districts where
cane sugar was made were prosperous
and beet-growing districts would be
more so. He said the community
was under a legal claim, represented
by signed contracts, to supply a defin
ite acreage, but that there was also
moral duty to give every possible
ounce of support to the great institu
tion which hnd been built here. Re
ults with the crop grown by Mr.
Richard and his associates this year
bad been, so satisfactory that the
acreage would be lnoreasod 100 per
cent for next year.
0. TC. Nllos, manaRer of the Leon
ard Orchards, said that so well satis
fied was he with growing sugar hoots
from his exporlonro this season .that
next year every ncro of the 2000-acre
ranch that iouhl bo properly pre
pared ami. minted would be plnntod.

OF ZEPPELIN
Thousands of Londoners See
Giant Dirigible Brought to
Earth During a Raid Over
England Last Night
Iondon, Oc(. 2. The huge super
Zeppelln shot down In last night's
attempted raid on London crumpled
up and broke Into several pieces as
it plunged earth ward 'before the eyes
of thousands of Londoners.
The commander of the destroyed
Zeppelin was found In a field near
part of the wreck this morning, still
alive, but terribly injured. He was
driven Into the wreckage with auch
force that the Imprint of hla body
was plainly visible when be was pick-
edup. , Thirteen bodies hsd been re
covered at noon.
Fragments fell from SO to 60 yards
apart and with them mangled bits
of bodies. ' Unlike previous ralda in
the vicinity of London, last night's
attack was signalled by no tremend
ous gunfirlng. A tew shots from
anti-aircraft guns brought thousands
to the roof tops or to the streets
throughout London. They gaxed to
ward, the 'starlit heavens, while
searchlights converged their silver
shafts on a Zeppelin, the whirr 'of
whose engines could be heard very
faintly.
The Zeppelin was lost to view for
a moment. Then suddenly a small.
red speck appeared In the heavens,
gradually growing into a red ball of
fire.
The flames spread like lightning,
lighting up the country for miles
around. The Zeppelin seemed to
stsnd still for the moment, present
ing an Indescribable' spectacle. Its
blazing, flaming fabric silhouetted
the aluminum framework. Every de
tail stood out as if lined by some
artist depicting a scene from hell.
For several seconds the burning
airship rested on even keel. Then It
tilted downward and shot earthward
like a rocket. Pieces of flaming ma
terial separated themselves from the
main mass, dropping along the atde
In long, flaming tongues that gave
the plunging, fiery, mass the appear
ance of a comet '
An awe-inspiring sllencex settled
over the crowd as the Zeppelin fell.
There were no explosions. No roar
from the rush through the air of this
great body' reached the London
crowds. But with the dying after
glow a mighty cheer rollod up from
North London and swept the entire
city, registering England's triumph.
Before 4he Zeppelin was hit her
crew threw overboard 39 bombs.
Most of tlyrn were explosive.
A supplementary report added by
General French this afternoon said
that one man was klltod, one woman
Injured and Insignificant material
damage done.

UQH
New York, Oct 2. -This city felt
the first pangs of a milk famine to
day. Only half the usual supply was
served and much of that was milk
stored up-state in anticipation of the
strike.
Meantime, the distributors
the Big Three sought to have the
dairymen's league, the producers'
combination, Investigated as con
spirator, s
The dairymen's representatives re
torted with the claim that they form
ed merely a co-operative organiza
tion, and that the Big Three was In
reality a vicious trust. And at Al
bany authorities started probing both
questions., ;
New York bad probably only half
of Its cu.tomary 2,500,000 quarts
this morning. The grown-ups tcok
the milk famine philosophically. They
abstained from cereals needing milk
or cream, and took their coffee
straight This wss In keeping with
advertised appeals of the "Big Three",
that patrons consume Just as little
as they could In order that hospitals
and babies might not suffer The dis
tributors arranged that 'these two
groups should get first consideration.
.Up-state the farmers did picket
duty. Reports from a number of
points told of raids on milk teams
bound for the creameries of the Big
Three. There appeared a grim spirit
of halting all shipments and. accord
ing to Information, the league has the
supply virtually cornered. - .
To meet the shortage partly, the
Big Three . has ordered shipments
from as far awry as Canada and Illi
nois. But they admit that as mat
ters now stand they can hold out
little hope of anything but an actual
milk famine within the next four
days. ,
