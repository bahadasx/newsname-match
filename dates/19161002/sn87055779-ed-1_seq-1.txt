NKW YORK, Oct. 2. Thousands
of New Yorkers waited vainly for
th? milkman today. Many thou
sands more will be milkless tomor
row. By Thursday the supply for
greater New York will suffice only
for infants and sick, according to
present indications.
The farmers' milk strike is on in
earnest and their power of curtail
ing this city's supply . already is
making itself felt. The New York
milk concerns on their part stick to
their original assertion that it will
be a fight to the finish." but lead
ing officials admitted today that the
public will be the main sufferer.
State's Atty. (Jen. Woodbury, is
'ooked upon by the dealers as a pos
sible arbiter of the trouble. lie is
considering their charge that the
Dairymens league is a combination
in restraint of trade.
Today's milk deliveries were only
from r0 to 65 jer cent normal. P.y
Thursday it is expected that they
will have fallen off to 15 per cent.
The Dairymen's league says:
"The big milk distributors of New
York city pay Ips for milk than it
costs us to produce it. We demand
J2.15 for 100 pounds of three per
cent fat milk. The farmers' 4 0 years
of slavery are at an end. We will
not renew the contracts at the old
rrices. The milk corporations must
deal with the leatrue. not with the
individual farmers."
The big distributing corporations
say:
"The Dairymens' league is a com
bination in restraint of trade. We
have a right to deal with the in
dividual farmers. We refuse to pay
more for the raw product than at
pres-enu"

BRITISH PLAN TO
Germany's Resumption of
Submarine Warfare to be
Deferred Some Months.
Iotom.tt !iial Xw Service:
WASHINGTON. Oct. Ger
many's resumption of submarine
warfare without warning against
munition-carrying vessels, consider
ed a certainty, likely will be defer
red some months yet. That it is in
evitable, dip'omatic circles here
know. Hut it will be preceded by
renewed diplomatic negotiations,
and Germany again will ask this
government to use its good otfices
to secure concessions from the en
tente aliies.
Such an appeal will be u. -el ess. It
has been made very plain to Amer
ican diplomats in London, Paris and
Petrograd that the entente has de
cided that with the coming of the
winter months the German blockade
is to be tightened to the utmost
limit. At certain points an abso
lute instead of a technical blockade
will be laid. And the effect must
be an increase in the bitter feel
ing in Germany and further en
couragement to all who would '"use
every weapon" in retaliation against
the nation's enemies.
When the decision is reached that
the moment has fome again to util
ize to the utmost the submarine
weapon of the German navy it is
expected that a full agreement will
be entered into between Germany
and Austria covering the Mediter
ranean, the Atlantic and the North
sea. The undersea boats of both na
tions will follow a mapped out line
and simultaneous with the derision
announcement will made of the
change in policy.
Ambassador Gerard will explain
the exact situation when he reaches
Washington.
