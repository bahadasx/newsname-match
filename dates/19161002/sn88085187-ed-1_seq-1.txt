FATHER HYLEBOS LINKS
TODAY WITH VANISHED
ERA OF MISSIONARIES
By Mabel Abbott
Seventy-five years ago,
on tlie first Sunday In Oc
tober, 1841, tbe first Cath
olic Indian mission In the
Northwest was established
by Father De Smet, a Jesuit
missionary, who, with five
companions, had made the
journey from St. Louis into
the wilderness by boat, over
land trail and mountain
passes.
Yesterday tlie diamond
jubilee of tlie event was
celebrafed at St. I.eo'.i church
witli solemn high mass, said
by the Very Ray. Father P.
F Hylebos, of Tacoma, a
venerable priest who is in
his own person a link be
-1 trass that day r.iid this.
* * *
The story of Father
Hylebos begins in Oram
iM'imt, Belgium, where he
was born 68 years ago.
When Wellington defeated
.Napoleon at Waterloo, a
young Britisli officer, ('apt.
Peter Sleward, was left for
dead on the field, found by
kindly Belgian fanners and
nursed back to health, mar
ried a Belgian girl and be
came the grandfather of
Peter Francis Hylebos.
Graduate of Louvain
The boy studied engineer
ing and then studied for the
priesthood, was graduated
from the University of Lou
vain, Belgium, and was or
dained in 1870.
He came to Vancouver,
Wash., the trip requiring 38
days.
There he served as secre
tary of Father Blanchet, one
of the group of early Jesuit
missionaries which Included
DeSmet. The young priest
knew nil these famous pio
neers of the church. He be
came president of Holy An
gels college at Vancouver,
built several churches tn
Southwest Washington, snd
finally succeeded Father
Brondel In the great parish
that extended from the
Cascade mountains to Grays
Harbof.
"There is not a river from
tlie Puyallup to the Colum
bia that I have not swum on
horseback," he says.
First Service in '80
In 1880 he held his first
public service In the village
of Tacoma, ln a building at
the corner of Division and
Yakima avenues, with a
conogregatlon of 18 people.
In 1884 he built a new one
at South Eleventh and D,
where the market now
stands, and In 1903, the year
of the panic, he built the
present St. Leo's church.
In the meantime, lie had
been doing many other
things.
St. George's Indian school,,
a farm of 141 acres, near
Milton, was opened In 1888.
In the same year he donated
a block on 18th and J, on
which he built part of what
is now St. Joseph's hospital.
He donated a hlock at 18th
and I and built the first part
STRIKE NEAR SETTLEMENT
Members of the Tacoma long
shoremen's union are Jubilant
over the prohable settlement of
the waterfron*. strike on Puget
Sound in a manner which Is said
to be favorable to them.
Following secret balloting by
-members of the union la Tacoma

Siiiulay, an announcement that
the men will go back to work Is
expected some time Monday.
Neither the workers nor the
employers are allowed to state
Ihe exact terms of the agreement.
They are awaiting an official
of the Visitation academy.
He was named on the Indian
commission of the Catholic
Indian Bureau by Cardinal
Gibbons, and wenl to Wash
ington, D. C, to adjust dif
ferences between the govern
ment and Catholic btsbOßS in
charge of Indian schools in
dioceses all over tho I'nited
Slates, and secured an ap
propriation of MIw.OSQ
from the government for
these schools.
He became vicar general
of the diocese, and SMUSS
two or three trips 10 Rome,
on the last one of which he
brought back the )>apal bene
diction, which he delivered,
in 1(11, on his retirement,
after a pastorate of H 1 years.
lie has seen good and bad
times In Tacoma, and lias
taken bis part, not only as
a churchman but as a citi
zen in all of them.
"More bad times than
good times, 1 think," he
said, thoughtfully, Friday,
when 1 asked him to tell me
something of what he had
seen.
"But there were some that
were so good they fairly
turned our heads.
"Hops went to $1.2."> a
pound at one time .and some
of our good farmers along
the Puyallup and in other
hop regions, who I verily
believe had never seen ?100
at one time before, sudden
ly found themselves with
$40,000 or so In cash: and
1 shall never forget boine of
the ways they took to get
' rid of it.
Riotous Days
"They would come Into
Tacoma and buy a saloon
and Its contents —literally
buy the whole thing—and
then proceed to clean It out
by giving the liiiuor away to
everybody that canity along.
"The funniest thing I ever
saw, however, was when one
elated hop grower bought
out a store full of Christ
mas toys snd forced them
upon the passers-by. For
blocks up and down Pacific
avenue you could see men
pulling toy trains along the
sidewalks, tooting tin trum
pets or playing with mon
keys on stricks.
"Perhaps tlie wildest time
was when 4 was appointed
special deputy sheriff and pa
trolled the two blocks be
tween "th and 9th on Com
merce street while the Chi
nese were being expelled
from town.
"1 was anti-Chinese my
self, all right," he asserted
sturdily.
"It had got so nobody else
could get any work. 1 fav
ored their removal. But just
the same, order had to be
maintained, and it was a
dangerous situation. There
were 800 Chinese in the city
and there were some pro-
Chinese among the whites.
"But everything was man
aged with great self-control
and forethought, and the re
moval was accomplished
without any bloodshed."

kindly finger in all the city's
experiences. -
During tlie years m 1594
snd 1895, when many men
were out of work, Father Uy
lebos, with one eve on the
public dIStfSSS and the other
ln his difficulties in netting
tlie farm at St. Osorgs's In
dian school cleared, hit upon
tlie Idea of inviting unemploy
ed men to help In'the clear
ing. He offered no pay but
board and lodging; Imt ev
ery Monday morning at half
past seven he had a wagon
In front of St. Leo's, and
sometimes as many as two
dozen men climbed in and
were lattled away to work.
They were of course tree to
leave at an\ time. Some
would work a day or two,
others would slay a week,
others longer. Much land
was cleared, and many nun
were fed nnd lodged at the
nilssion.
Surveyors Name It
It was before this, during
tlie building of the school,
that a party of surveyors in
the neighborhood, noticing
the little creek that rises near
St. George's, asked workmen
some questions, and then
went away.
About a year later, Father
Hylebos, looking over n large
government map, found the
little creek, with his own
name attached to it. Much
puzzled, because the creek
had never had any name but
the Indian one of "Kochl,"
which was never used by the
whites, he tried to find out
how his name had got Into
tho map. 80 far as he could
learn, the party of surveyors
who had questioned the
workmen about the school
must have named Hylebos
creek at that time.
Father Hylebos' declining
years have been saddened by
tlie shadow of the great war,
which hsf*. made his people
In Belgium homeless.
"I cannot forget them," he
says. "1 do not want to for
get them. I want to be re
minded every day of how
they are suffering."

CHAPTER I
The Great Mrs. lie Peyster
The unseasonable May chill was
banished from Mrs. De Peyster's
[sitting room by a wood fire that
crackled in the grate.
Besides a small steel sale,
whose outer cabinet work trans
formed that fortress against burg
larious desire into an article of
furniture tiiat harmonized with
Die comfortable elegance of a
lady's boudoir, sat Mrs. De Pey
ster herself, transferring her Jew
els from the trays of the safe to
leather cases.
Before the fire sat a lady whose
tears had long since dried that she
had shed when she had bid good
bye to thirty. A dozen years be
fore, Mrs. De Peyster, then in the
fifth year of her widowhood, had
graciously undertaken to manage
and underwrite the debut of her
second cousin and had tried to
discharge her duty in the import
ant matter of securing a husband.
But her efforts had been futile,
and to Bay that Mrs. De Peyster
had not succeeded was to admit
that poor Olivetla Harmon was,
Indeed, a failure.
Mrs. De Peyster glanced at the
open door of her bedroom—hesi
tated —then called: "Miss Gard
ner!"
A trim and pretty girl steppea
ln. "Yes, Mrs. De Peyster."
"Will you please call up Jjidge
Harvey's office once more, and in
quire if there is any news about
my son? And aak when Judge
Harvey will be here."
Miss Gardner crossed to Mrs.
De Peyster desk and took up the
telephone.
They sat silent until the receiv
er was hung up.
"Well, Miss Gardner —any trace
of my son yet?"
"They have learned notblag
whatever."
"And—end Judge Harvey?
When wtll he be here?"
"Hie office said he wns at a
meeting ot tha directors of the
New York and New England rail
road, aad that he was coming here
straight from Ihe meeting."
"Thank >ou. .Miss Gardner. You
may now go on with my packing.

"Why. Cousin Caroline, what Is
it about Jack?" hurst out Ollvetta
after Miss Gardner had gone. "Has

Olivet ta was one of the few per
sons with whom Mrs. De Peyster
could bring herself to he confi

know. About ,-t week ago Jack
suddenly disappeared—"
"How terrible!" cried the sym
pathetic Ollvetta. "Went a week

"The last one Is just going,

to board up tlie windows and the

NO REDLIGHTS,
NO 'BOOZING'
BY E. A. PETERS
For 10 years I have been a police reporter In Tacoma.
And a police reporter gains an insight Into underworld condi
tions that is not always granted even to the officials of the polic*
department.
A police reporter not only reports crime, but he must be
familiar with the under strata of city life, ir his value aa a reporter
of such news is to bS high.
So when Polios Commissioner I'eltlt told me Saturday that he
was planning a tour of inspection for I hat evening, I eagerly Invited
myself along.
"I don't want you to think that I am Inspecting conditions In
Tacoma because I distrust my police department," Pettlt explained.
"But I have fouml that no two men look on the same thing
alike. If I am to gain a direct insight Into the underworld, I find
Uml I can do It far better by personal observation than by reading
typewritten reports."
We left police liead«|iiarterH al ?:SI p. m. Not a soul In Ta
coma knew our mission. We were "traveling Incog," and we wanted
no poliie escort.
I knew tbe history of Thcoius's night life like a book. And I
had planned to "show" the commissioner a lew tilings that he did
not suspect. lie turned the tables on me. It was the police re
porter, instead ol Mm police commissioner, who was "shown."
Just One Lone Place Open
(lur first objective was tlie old tenderloin district at 14th and
Court A. TOO years ago even six years ago this neighborhood
was one of Hie worst hotbeds of vies In ths northwest.
"I don't believe we'll see much down here, but 1 don't want to
overlook a single pla«'o where we might Hud the disorderly ele
ment," explained the commissioner.
We circled the half-block or ungainly name structures that
mice boused hundreds of the hirelings of Pete Sanilberg.
10 very door on A l • tiv was padlocked, anil lhe locks were rusty.
Only one upstairs aparti'miit was occupied, and II «'ontalneil a lu
cent lodging house. We sa uiili-red Into the "alley."
This narrow, broken-down tkOrOttghfare I remembered as a
| concourse for every human derelict who formerly resided In Tacoma.
We knocked at every door. One flew open to our touch, and a
dank, musty odor greeted us from dark Interiors.
A large woman In flowing house dress admitted us.
"You are Commissioner Pettlt, are you not?" she asked, smil
ing. "And this must be your son. You resemble ono another.
Won't you come Into lhe office?"
On the wall was a placard announcing that we were In a lodg
ing house. Rooms could be had for II and 18 cents, lhe sign said,
A hotel register lay on a table. We chatted for a few moments and
then withdrew.
"She's the last one In the block, and we're goiug to get her oul
in a day or so," explained the commissioner.
Dance Hall In Operation
"She evades the police by making every pretense of running
a rooming house. Aud she is ho clever that we have not been able
to get her. Lives aloni-, too, in that decrepit house. When we get
her out, the whole place will be empty, and It will never reopen, If
1 can help It."
We wandered back to Pacific avenue, and entered several of
the buildings that formerly housed the "dumps," or cheapest grade
saloons In the city.
ln two of them we found dunce halls. Tiny talilee clung to
the walls, while young couples in tight embrace swayed to the music
