By Henry Wood,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
With the French Armies before Peronne, Oct. 2.
Naval forces have joined the allies here in the great land
battle of the Somme, seventy miles from the sea.
Iron clad monitors, utilizing France's magnificent net
work of canals along the Somme, centering at Peronne,
are participating in the daily bombardment of Mount
St. Quentin, which dominated Peronne from the east.
They advance slowly on the German stronghold as the
last lines creep forward and have done much effective
work.
Mount St. Quentin, constituting the key to the defense
of Peronne, is slowly and steadily being encirceld by the
French in the same manner that preceded the capture of
Combles. The position, a strong one, stands on the sum
mit of a hill overlooking Peronne.
Marine gunners, who serve the pieces aboard the
monitors, go about? their business in the same methodical,
clockwork manner, as ordinary workmen beginning
their day's labor. After their moraing plunge in the
canal and breakfast, they begin tuning up the guns.
On land the same mechanical process goes on. The
artillery men "wash up", eat breakfast and then, appar
ently without the necessity of the officers' presence, be
gin serving the guns on scheduled time like so many fac
tory employes beginning work on the whistle.
. Occasional German shells, falling near, never enter
rupt for the single instant the routine of their day's
labor. Only the lunch hour does that. -
From an artillery observation post directly facing
Mount St. Quentin, I watched the French's methodical
army advance, encircling the village of Mount St'.
Quentin. The town itself already has suffered the same
fate as the 48 villages captured to date by the allies. It
is completely reduced to heaps of brick bats and protrud
ing tree stumps.
The Germans, however, still retain
(strongly fortified positions, especially
iu the cellars. The French artillery
wns complete! encircling the hill of the
village for the purpose, of interrupting
German communication with the rear
while occasional shells were directed at
Mount St. Quentin itseft to keep the
Germans busy iu their dugouts tind cel
lars. Invariably these shells sent' up
groat red clouds of brick dust from the
pulverized houses.
The bulk of the artillery continued
this methodical destruction of German
defense which still separate the French
first line trenches from the base of the
hill.
' When the proper time comes, Mount
St. CJuentiu will be taken by the French
a:id with a minimum loss of men, an ar
tillery officer told me today. In the
final assault the infantrr will dash for
ward preceded I'.HI yards by a curtain
fire of shells that will not permit the
fwrviving Germans to inflict any se
rious losses.

An enemy counter attack forced the
British to relinquish part of the Kegina

been going on for 24 hours.
After beating off German counter

east of Knucourt 1,'Abbaye, the British
established their front in that region

San Francisco, Oct. 2. Manufacture

today after the completion of successful
experiments by Mrs. Anne Gilbert Cox.
Mrs. Cox is the wife of Dr. II. Itnrringer
Cox, inventor of the dry cell battery,
the wireless subterranean telephone and
other new devices.
With the liquid rubber applied in any
desired consistency with a brush, any
material can be effectively water-proofed
say they who have witnessed Mrs.
Cox's demonstrations. The dressing,
once applied, is impervious to either
heat or cold, and in one of her experi
ments, Mrs. Cox coated a piece of tis
sue paper without affecting the flexibil
ity of the paper.

discovery 'for six years in her husband '
laboratory, .She has a thorough, tech

BLAZING ZEPPELIN
1
Silhoutted Against Sky Every
Detail of Burning Ship
Is Seen
By Wilbur S. Forrest,
(Cnited Press Staff Conespondent.)
London, Oct. 2. The huge super-Zeppelin
shot down- in last night's at
tempted raid on London, crumpled up
and broke into several pieces as it
plunged earthward before the eyes of
thousands of Londoners.
The commander of tho destroyed
Zeppelin was found in a field near part
of the wreck this morning, still alive
but terribly injured. lie was driven
into the wrcckagiu with such force
that the imprint of his body was
plainly visible when he was picked up.
Thirteen bodies had been recovered at
noon.
Fragments fell from fifty to sixty
yards apart and with them mangled
bits of bodies. Unlike previous ruids
in the vicinity of London, last night's
attack was signalled by no tremendous
gun firing. A few shots from anti
aircraft guns brought thousands to the
rooftops or to the streets, throughout
London. They gazed toward the star
lit henwns while searchlights con
verged their silver shafts on a Zeppelin,
the whir of whose engines could be
heard very faintly.
The Zeppelin was lost to view for a
moment. Then suddenly a small red
speck appeared iu the heavens, gradu
ally growing into a red ball of fire.
The flames spread like ligTitning,
lighting up tho country for miles
a rou ml. The Zeppelin seemed to stand
still for the moment, presenting an in
describable spectacle. Its blar.ing.
flaming fabric silhotted the frame-
worlf Kvery detail stood out as if
lined by some artist depicting a scene
rrom hell.
For several seconds the burning air
shin rested on even keel. Then it tilt
ed downward and shot earthward like
a rocket. Pieces of flaming material
serited themselves from the main
mass, dropping along the side in lung
flaming tongues that gnVo file piling
ing fiery mass the apeparauco of a
comet. '
An awe inspiring silence settled the
crowd as the Zeppelin fell. There were
no explosions. No roar from the rush
through the air of this great bodv
reached the London crowds. But with
the dying afterglow, a mighty cheer
rolled on from North Iondon mid
swept the entire city, registering F.ng
land's triumph.

By H. C. Hamilton.
(l.'nited Press .sta'ff correspondent.)
National League Park, Philadelphia,
Oct. 2. The Pbillies'lost a chance to
step into first place again by divid
ing a two-ply bill with the Boston
Braves here this afternoon.
In the first contest Alexander( pre
mier pitcher of the National league,
scored Uw sixteenth shutout of the sea
son, blanking the Braves by a Z to 0
score.
Boston had little difficulty, however,
in stopping the hillies for the second,
the pennant chasers playing loosely and
letting in most of the Braves' runs
through errors. "Lucky" Al Deniuree
allowed them nine hits, but for the most
part they were scattered. At the most
the score should not hnve been so
large, Despite the fact that bis right
arm was struck by a stinging drive
from Demaree, Reulbach pitched theen
tire ganifr for the Braves and at no time
was he iu serious danger of being wal
loped. Coombs Etapped Giants. , -F.bbets
Fiord, Brooklyn, N. Y., Oct.' 2.
Jack Ooombs, comeback, stopped the
Giants in their tracks this afternoon
and had the Dodgers safe ou their way
to tho pennant. Allowing only six hits,
ho turned buck the AfcOruw sensations
without n run. Ten thousand fans, in
honor of Huckerday and the other
Dodgers, saw the fray.
Opposed to Coombs, oue of baseball's
oldest stars, was the National league's
newest sensation, Ferdie Schupp. But
for (in error by Fletcher in the fourth,
the youthful hurler would have escaped
without being scored ngaiust. Daubert
reached first on that error and took sec
ond on nn error by Ilerzog. Wheat
scored him with a single to left.
Anderson finished the game for the
Giants and saw one more added to the
Brooklyn total, on two hits, a walk oud
a wild pitch.
The Dodgers put one over in the
fourth when Daubert reached first on
Fletcher's boot mid scored ou Wheat's
blow to left.
The Giants pushed Hoke to second in
the tilth but he was left stranded.
The game went into the seventh in
ning with Coombs still pitching shutout
ball. Only three men faced hi m in the
sixth but in the seventh Holkc singled
and reached third when the bull rolled
through Johnston. Two were out nnd
Mitvmnw saved t oombs by u running
catch of Rariden's short fly over seeW
oud.
Schupp had been touched for only
three hits w hen he gave way to u pinch
hitter in the eighth. Fred Anderson
took up the pitching chorus for the
Giants.
Brooklyn put another run over in the
eighth when .Miller singled, reached sec
ond on n walk, third on an infield hit
and scored on n wild pitch.

his republican opponent to divulge how

There may bo no direct questions, no

questions and challenges will be found
in the president's speeches, even as
they abounded ill his last one, when he
indicated war would be the republican
method of its foreign policy. A new
optimlstiu atmosphere, was in evidence
in democratic circles here with the
knowledge the president has let down

foreign policy and will continue his at
tempts to shnw that any change in this
