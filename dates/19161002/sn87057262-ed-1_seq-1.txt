rocking chairs in the mansion's liv

They are the Misses Alice and

of the three women were today sent

friends might separate them.
Misses Agnes and Alice steadfastly
refused offers in marriage in their
younger days, fearing that marriage
would mean separation. They were
bosom friends of Miss Stretton. The
