LONDON*. Oct. 2.?Ten Zeppelins
look part in Sunday night's raid over
England. Tv o of them attempted to
attack London. One of them was
driven away and the other was des
troyed. Xo reports of causaltics have
been received. Following is an official
account of the raid:
"Ten airships crossed the cast coast
Sunday night between o'clock and
midnight. One airship approached the
north of London at about 10 p. m. and
was driven o f by guntire and pursued
by aeroplanes, ft attempted to return I
from the northwest but was attacked!
by guns and aeroplanes and brought
to earth 'n flames in the neighborhood
of Potter's Bar. shortly belore mid
night.
"A second airship attempted to at
tack London from the northeast and
was driven off. l?ombs were dropped.}
Xo reports of casualties or damage!
have yet been received.
"The remaining airships wandered
aimlessly owr 'he eastern counties. In
Lincolnshire bomb^ were dropped pro
miscuously. Most of them appear to
have been dropped in open country
without doing drvnage.
"The airship destroyed was of the
latest type."
Friends of fount Zeppelin were
alarmed when they learned that an
other airship had been brought down
in England Sunday night, says the
Amsterdam correspondent of the Ex
change Telegraph Company. The rount
intended to take part in the raid, the
correspondent tables, but a message
sent to Germany elicited the informa
tion that at the last .moment, owing
to the persuasion of his family, he de
cided not to join the raiders.
Except for part of the envelope there
is left hardly a vestige recognizable
as part of the huge airship which was
brought down Sunday night near Pot
I ter's Bar. The Zeppelin burned more
'fiercely than the one previously des
troyed. which, like it. fortunately fell
In an open field.
The members of the crew were in
cinerated and the bodies scattered over
the field on which the airship alighted
some eighty yards from a farmer's
cottage.
The Zeppelin appeared to remain al
most sationary m the air for three
minutes after the envelope burst Into
flames. The tongues of lire seemed to
lick along the b: g until it was all
ablaze. Even then i' dropped so slow
ly that many persons, who had been
awakened until the cheering aroused
them, were able to reach the windows
in time to sec it fall.
Neither the airship which was des
troyed nor the second one which at
tacked I^ondon succeeded in penetrat
ing the outer defenses of the capital.
Little or no damage was done either
by them or by the eight others which
operated over eastern counties.

MINES HAMPERED
BY DR UNKENNESS
Great Quantities of Liquor Are
Brought In and Men Are j
Incapacitated.
Coal operators of the Clarksburg
district arc complaining that so lit-;
tl" attention la b^ing paid to the pro
hibition laws of th*? state that mining
operations are being seriously hin
dered throughout the district.
It Is declared that Sunday has be
come to be generally recognized
among the miners us "booze day" and
that a majority of the men get on
such big drunks that they are un
| able to report for work Monday j
i morning. Resulting from the Impor
tation of several cases of whiskey
Sunday morning to a mining plant
just west of the city. It is stated* alt
the miners are out and the plant was
I forced to suspend Monday. At an- j
: other smaller plant east of the cfty;
I nineteen men were said to be too
drunk to go to work. All the plants
i In the district were similarly affect
ed Monday.
Operators ray It as easy for a
miner to buy whiskey at the mining
camps In the county as It Is to buy a
loaf of bread or a piece of meat. It
is believed that most of the whiskey
sold nt the mining towns is taken in
automobiles by professional bootleg
gers. Ten automobiles In ono string i
are said to have come into the coun- j
ty a few nights ago with big cargoes
of whiskey.

Another expenditure which was
the basis of an Insinuation by Corn

for running down Htate odlclaln, was
a requisition for $4,000 which had
been drawn from the civic contingent
fund Tor line in connection with tho
criminal prosecution of A. Leo Well,
under Indictment in the Intermediate
court of Kanawlia county for at
tempted bribery of two memberi of

expenditure wan authorized. It la ev

composed or Democrats and Repub

the amount was turned over In Ita ?
entirety to T. C. Townsend. prose

tention la nlao called to tho fact that
an Investigating committee of the
legislature composed of Democrats
ano Republicans approved the expen
diture and declared that no portion
of tho $4,000 has been misappropri
ated.
In conclusion Governor Hatfield
states Hint he will take the stump
to defend his administration and will
bo glad to meet Mr. Cornwell at
time he rhooses to do so. His
statement is as rolllows
Governor's Statement,
"In his cowardly refusal to accept
my challenge to meet him before the
peoplo of the state In a Joint dlscns
slon of the Issues that he has raised
in connection with the record of my

Democratic nominee for governor,
has seen fit to continuo his malicious ,5
Insinuations as to certain expendi
tures made by me as governor of
the state.
Mr. Cornwell declares that hli
"time in too much occupied with this
campaign to undertake the burden of
securing for the governor audiences ,*
before which to defend his admlnl*; i
tration." So palpably Insincere up
on Its face Is this kind of a statement
that It. must be apparent to all per- "j
sons that Mr. Cornwell Is afraid to
meet me in Joint discussion of the
record of this administration. So
far as the size of the audiences is
concerned. It would appear that If
he hoped to gain anything from sucb
a discussion he would be glad tc
have as large a crowd as possible
present.. And so far as concerns thC' ,
site of the crowds that have beer
