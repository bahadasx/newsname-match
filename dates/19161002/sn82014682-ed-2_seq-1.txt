Lane Takes Up Matter of Strike
Settlement With Employers;
Strikers Agree
FIRM STANDFOR NEW
WAGE SCALE MAINTAINED
Waterfront Situation Practical
ly Unchanged Since Meet
ing of Last Saturday
In an endeavor to bring about an
understanding between the strikers
and shippers. Mayor Lane Is this after
noon planning to present to the latter
plans for arbitration. The situation is
now at loggerheads and the mayor pro
poses to have both sides choose three
men and the six pick a seventh,
these to form a committee of arbitra
tion. The strikers have already signi
fied their readiness to leava the mat
ter to arbitration. He talked with J.
E 8heedy of th Inter-Island this
afternoon. ; v .
That the question of an "open" or
"closed" shop has been withdrawn
from their . demands, , but; that, their
request for 40 cents an houf -and 53
cents fgr overtime must be. granted
before they return to work, was the
announcement made to Mayor John
C. Lane this morning by five delegates
of the longshoremen's union.
The men called on the mayor this
morning to inquire whether he had re
ceived any word from the employers
as to further r-lans for a settlement
of thd strike.. Mayor Lane told them
he had not He said, he was absolute
ly neutral In - the matter but would
be glad at any time to advise and help
them o far as he could.
Once Had Matter Up
"The meo told me," said the mayor,
-that before the death of Charles Bon,
head of the stevedorlngtcompany, they
had taken up the matter of increase
of pay with him and he had promised
them a raise but after he died nothing
was done about it.'; This time they in
tend to stay nt; until their, demands
are granted." '; ' V- ' , . y
The mayoraali that -.the, raise-in
pay is the only demand befcig made by
the strikers. They have withdrawn
the demand for a closed port and, hav
ing also lowered their first nfures,
believe it is now up to the shippers,
GIve us the Increased pay and we
will return to work and ask no ques
tions, is the stand they a. e taking, ac
cording to the mayor.
Waldron Would Give Raise
Fred Waldron when seen this morn
ing said that ho believed the 40 cents
an hour demanded will be the cheap
est In the long run. "Cheap labor is
always expensive,"- he said, "and if I
liad the power 1 would give the 40
ents and demand 40"centsvworth of
work.' When the , Great .1 Northern
comes, if stevedores cannot be ob
tained by the usual means, I shall go
out and get th-i men myself and pay
my own scale of wages."
Men Issue No Statement .
, When asked today blether they
tad, as a result of Saturday's arbi
tration conference at which they -rejected
the invitation of the commit
tee to return to work and then pre
sent their demands for higher wages,
requested the San Francisco union to
declare "unfair" cargoes load ed here
by -non-union labor, officials of the
local union Tefused to give out any
statement '
S. F. Not Counted On - " .'
"We don't count much on thattnd
(San Francisco)."- said a nnion offi
cial, "because 'e dont need to. We
have -things well under control here
and our relief fund is still large
enough to feed all cur-membera for
weeks to come.' : He added that the
union has not yet called on him for
the $250 he was able to secure as a
donation from the engineers union.
Ecwardaon Reported Sick, f ;, '
Jack Edwardson, who has acted as
spokesman for the stevedores union
since it was oreanizedand is a mem
ber of . its standing iJmmittee, was
not at the office this morning, as he
was reported not to be feeling well.
Tie had not shown up at union head
quarters down to noon today. Ed
wardson said Friday that on the re
sults of Saturday's arbitration , con
ference would depend whether San
Francisco "union men would Be asked
to declare unfair the cargoes of steam
ers loaded Jiere by strikebreakers.
JMo Trouble With Sonoma
No trouble was reported on the
waterfront this morning. The Oce-
-anic steamer Sonoma docked at 8:35
at Pier 10, and Superintendent J.'W.
Ttobertaon of the shipping department
of C. Brewer & Comparr, Oceanic
agents, at once put 23 Hawalians. his
own men, to work. "I had no trou
ble getting all the men I needed." he
said, "nor w as there any attempt by
union men to keep them from going
to work." The Sonoma had only 28
tons to unload here and 21 to take
on, so 25 s men were ample to work
the steamer. . v
225 Men Working Wilhelmlna
At noon today McCabe, Hamilton &
Kenny officials said they had 225 men
working the Matson . steamer Wilhel
mlna at Pier 19, "a we can possibly
use." They 6ald,50 of that number

some of the stevedores who left him
are not In sympathy with the ' strike
and that a majority of his men simply
qut their work io avoid danger of at
tack from the unionists, as they were
threatened by,tre, Filipino strikers on
their way home from work and urged
by their families not to again go to
the wharves to work.! Most of them,
he say, have no intention of joining
the union. : "I was told that SO of ray
men have joined the union already,
but I hardly believe so, as none of
them came nd reported . the jTact . to
me. . They all worked for; me;- for a
number of years and supported their
families under n.y employment," Mi2u
saki continued. ,v 1
Several of the Japanese stevedores
living in palama section were seen by
the StirDulletin this morning.. Each,
of them said: "We were compelled to
quit work for our own safety, but ye
are bitterly against our countrymen
who join the union. We all come from
the sugar plantations and were once
strikers - on the plantations and Buf
fered from these same Hawalians and
Filipino strikebreakers who took our
places nine years ago. The members
of the stevedores' union are mostly
Hawalians and Filipinos who have nev
er shown the slightest sympathy with
the Japanese. What is the necessity
for the Japanese, to join the union and
assist those who -opposed us nine years
ago? The so-called stevedores union
Is known to us as an anti-Japanese or
ganization. They will not welcome the
Japanese Into their membership., They
only admitted some of the Japanese
into the union for their own policy
against the shippers and for. the pro
motion of their claims for .higher
wages and they are going to. ute the
Japanese as their tools. It Js foolish
for the Japanese to join the union.
If protection la given us by the ship
ping concerns we will go back to work
at any time."
Maklno Gives Views
Fred Mskino and his undermen are
working among the strikers and those
who quit, their work for safety. He
said this morning in regard to ' the
strike, situation: "It is rather' too
small a question for the large shipping
concerns to hold out the fact that the
union men did not properly negotiate
with . them before the strike. The
union men recognize that they made a
mistake In that step, but It is too late
to correct it now. The shippers must
admit the claims of the unionists or
the strike may spread to some other
body of laborers.
"I am glad Mr. Waldron is in favor
of higher wages for the laborers. - I
am going to back the strikers among
the Japanese until they succeed. Then
I shall wash my hands of this matter
and attend to my own business.
: T. Mizusaki had more than 150 men
under him before the strike, and lost
about 50 men shortly after the strike
started. He still holds 100 men and
was working on Pier 17 till Saturday
evening. Today he has only 17 men
with him.;:.- , .

t' . Republican Circles ;
i! With primary election day four
flays "away A tdozen "slates," some of
them printed,' have made their ap
pearance, mostly in the Republican
amps.u'.
The slate-makers have framed up
various combinations , for the house
or the senate, the purpose- being to
insure the nomination in the primar
ies of e0me'Cndidate or group of can
didates, either by combining strength
with others or by the simple process
of "dumping others.
One slate, for instance, is for. the
Republican house nominations in the
fourth district. A candidate told the
Star-Bulletin- today that this slate con.
tains but two names, and those who
receive, the slate are advised to vote
for but two only, so1 that the Vote
other candidate might get wUI i be
correspondingly lessened. ..' .
- A well-defined rumor went the
rounds today that several Hawaiian
politicians are advising their 1 follow
ers to "dump the haoles" or white
candidates. The Star-Bulletin spoka
f to a number of candidates and Repuo-
lican .workers, and without exception
they said they had heard, the rumor.
Some put little faith in it Others be
lieve that there is a strong undercur
rent against the "haoles" and that the
primary election next Saturday will
show It. . - w
Among the slates either put out in
printed or written form or discussed
are the following. ' . ,
In the Republican fight for the
three nominations for the senate on
Oahu there are two slates being ex
pensively boomed. One has S. P. Cor

it The other has Shingle, Correa
and Achl. Another slate has Shingle,
Lucas and Correa a reverse of the
first-named, for what reason has not

report which seems to be well sub
