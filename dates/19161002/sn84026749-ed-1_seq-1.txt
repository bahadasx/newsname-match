BERLIN, Oct. 2. Roumanian

WITH THE FRENCH ARMIES
BEFORE PERONNE, Oct. 2.
Naval forces have joined the allies
here in the great land battle of
the Somme, seventy miles from
the sea.
Ironclad monitors, utilizing
Trance's magnificent network of
canals along the Somme, centering
at Peronnc, are participating in
the daily bombardment of Mt. St.
Quentin, which dominates Peronne
from the east.
They advance slowly on the Ger
man stronghold as the land lines
creep forward, and have adone
much effective work.
Encircling Town.
Mt. St. Quentin, constituting tho
key to tha defense of Peronne, Is
slowly and steadily being encircled

that preceded tho capture of Com

Pieces aboard the monitors, go about
their business In the same method

workmen beginning: their day's la

tho canal and breakfast they begin
tuning uo the guns.
On land the samo mechanical proc
ess goes on. The artillerymen "wash
up." eat breakfast, and then, appar
ently without the necessity of the
officers' presence, begin serving tho
guns on scheduled time, like so many
factory employes beginning work on
the whistle.

Village Wrecked.
The village of Mt. St. Quentin al

the forty-eight villages" captured to
date by tho allies. It is reduced to
heaps of brickbats and protruding
tree stumps.
The Germans, however, still retain
strongly fortified positions, especial

was completely encircling the hill 'of

There is no motion picture censorship in Washington.
It is entirely up to the exhibitors of motion pictures whether
there ever shall be.
We have adopted a rule that prohibits nudity in public in the
District of Columbia. This applies to the motion picture screen
or to the stage or to the public streets.
We will enforce that rule in the case of the motion picture
production "Purity."
I repeat, it is not a censorship of motion pictures. It is the
adoption of a general rule.
I personally look with disfavor on censorship as such, and hope
it will not be necessary in Washington. From an interview with
Commissioner Brownlow.

Commissioner Louis Brownlow ex
plained today tho action of the District
Commissioners In requesting Managor
Totn Moore, of tho Strand Theater, not
to exhibit Clifford Howard's allegorical
film production, "Purity."
In his statement to The Tmes, Com
missioner Urownlow very thoroughly
discussed tho motion picture situation
In Washington, and declared that ho
did not personally desire to seo a cen
sorship of (Urns established here.
"Thcro Is no question 'of film censor
ship In the ruling the Commissioners
have adopted regarding tho exhibition
of nudity In motion pictures or the
stage," said Commissioner Brownlow.
"Wo did not regard It as such. Cen
sorship Is necessarily a matter of dis
cretion. We have tried our best, for
the sake of tho motion picture men. to
avoid this. Wo havo established a rule
against nudity. This Involves no dis
cretion nt all. It Is simply a rule that

"It happens that this particular film,

The grown-ups took the milk fam

stained from cereals needing milk or
cream, and took their coffee straight.
This was In keeping, with advertised
appeals of the Big Threo that patrons
consume Just as little as they could.
In. order that hospitals and babies
might not suffer. The distributers
nrranged carefully that these two
groups should get first consideration.
Up-State, the farmers did picket duty.

"A seat for every passenger

seven square feet of floor space
for every standing passenger
during rush periods."
This standard of street car
service for the District, effec
tive November I, was adopted
by the Public Utilities Commis
sion today.
Non-rush traffic is defined as ex
isting from &:15 a. m. to 3:45 p.
m. and from 6:30 p. m. to 10:45
p. m. on midweek days and from
9:15 a. m. to noon and 6:30 to
10.45 on Saturdays.
Rush traffic is defined as exist
ing from 6:30 a. m. to 0:15 a. m. ,
on midweek days and Saturdays
and frdm 3:45 p. m. to 6:30 p. m.
on midweek days. Midweek days
are from Monday to Friday inclu
sive, legal holidays excepted.
The traction, companies will be
required to make such observations
as will keep them in touch with the
demands for service. The bureau
of transit and equipment inspection
also will make such observations
as may be deemed advisable'.
PERIODIC REPORTS REQUIRED
'Periodic reports of service In January.
April, July, and October also must be
submitted. These reports by the com
panies ore required to cover the ervlce
given ot certain observation point and
during certain specified periods for three
consecuUve days.
If from these report or cither Infor
mation It comes to the. knowledge; of
the commission that the service fur
nished Is below the standard, the com
mission may serve on the company f.
noncompliance notice. Within awven
days after such notice the companies
are required to tile with the commission
a BCnCQUie complying mm me ncrviuo
which shall become effective Immedt-
Because future traffic cannot always
be accurately estimated. It Is reallieJ,
tho commission says, that reasonable
time should be granted the companies
In case of noncompliance to permit of a
rearrangement of ttio schedules.
Follows Exhaustive Study.
The order follows an exhaustive study
by tho commission of trafflo condlUons
In Washington. Publlo hearings on the
standard were held October S, 1114,
and June 19, 191C
At these hearings the Washington
Railway and Electric Company took the
position that there Is no authority 1
h nuiiiin utilities act for adopting
such standard: that tho establishment
of tho standard Involves tho question of
rates: that the standard would Inter
fere with Interstate trafflo, and that
the commission has no authority to re
quire the companies to make observa
tions of traffic.
Certain changes have been made In
the original draft relating to observa
tions In order to remove technical legal
objections. With these changeb, tho
commission stated. It Is believed the
objections ot the company ara without
foundation.
Suggested A Trial.
The Capital Traction Company sug
gested that the commission go no
farther than' the establishment of a
rush standard at present and that this
be given a trial before formal adoption.
The commission states, however, that
It believes that the most thorough trial
of the regulations would reault from
their formal adoption and that there
la tvo danger of serious Injury to the
railways from such procedure since the
order standardise rather than In
