After beating off Germancounter
attacks against the newly' won posi
tions' east of Abbaye, the British es
tablished their lino last night frqm,
and cleared surrounding ,budlngs of
the enemy.
West of the town the British es
tablished the! rline last night from
a point of one hundred yards north
of Courcelette in the direcUon of the
Hessian trench. .
An enemy counter-attack forced the
British to relinquish parj of the Re
gina trench, where stubborn flghUng
has been going on for twenty-four
hours.
The British losses in" yesterday'
victory, when the Germans were
driven back on a '.3,000-yard front,
were unusually small. vThe new
""tanks" played an lmportantrbTe in
the advance and helped make it pos
sible for Haig's soldiers to win Ger
man trenches with slight losses.
A report from Budapest tonight says
that General Falkenhayn's victory
over the Rumanians near Hermann
stadt has halted the whole Rumanian
invasion of Transylvania.
The Rumanian left wing was so
badly demoralized by the blow that it
has become necessary to regroup all
forces on the Transylvanlan frontier.
The fighting in the region of Her
mannstadt has practically ended.

baum of Sti Louis who sells a line of

FIRST TO LOSE STATE
CHAUFFEUR LICENSE
Ora Mann, Fined 4 Times,
Suffers from Vehicle Acts
of 1911.
IN COURT TODAY
On Parole, Columbia Speed
Bug, Gets Call Down
From Judge Harris.
Ora Mann, 19 years old, of Colum
bia, is the first person in,-Missouri to
suffer 'the loss of his chauffeur's li
cense from the enforcement of the
Motor Vehicle Act of 1911. Mann was
fined 50 by Police Judge Edwards
last Monday for reckless driving and
as it was his fourth appearance for
the same misdemeanor, City Attorney
George S. Starrett reported the case
to Secretary of State Roach who with
drew his license.
Mann has been employed "by the
Bowser Taxicab Co., for-a year and
within that time has drawn three
fines of $5 and costs each time. His
widowed- mother has been0paying the
fines until last week when the assess
ment went beyond her means. After
being in jail for four days Mayor J.
M.- Batterton remitted ,half of it and
he was released.
During the five years the Motor Ve
hicle Acts have been on the Missouri
Statute books no other case of this
nature has been brought before the
Secretary of State. Mann will not be
able to drive a car in Missouri again
until. April, the law reading "No new
license shall be issued to such a per
son (convicted of an infraction of the
speed regulations) for at least six
months after the date of such con
viction nor thereafter except in the
discretion of the Secretary of State."
Although Mann is the first chauf
feur to have his license withdrawn he
is not, in all probability, the first to
be fined four times. In the larger
cities of the state drivers are fined
time after time but the failure to re
port' the cases to the secretary of state
allows them to retain their licenses.
Mann is on parole from the Boone
County Circuit Court. This morning
he appeared before Judge David H.
Harris to report his behavior, and re
ceived a lecture from the bench when
he admitted having done reckless
driving at Moberly recently. His ar
rest in Columbia recently was not re
ported by Sheriff Sapp.

Tba'spex of the high pressure wave
the Islr weather type of last week Is orer
New England this morning, but Its in

the Mississippi Valley. In .the west we
find just the opposite condition, as an

The .resulting weather Is windy and un
settled, with rain In California, Utah, Colo

In Missouri generally fair, although
somewhat windy weather will likely con
