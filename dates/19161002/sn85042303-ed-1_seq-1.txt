"The Hattle Cry of Peace" is here
today The show began at :!:UU
o'clock this afternoon at the Palace.
Supt. (.'. W. Ilichards dismissed the
schools ut 2::i0 to give the children
an opportunity to see thin wonderful
picture. Its influence is for pence and
not for war. It is a wholesome pic
ture and a very timely picture at this
time in tli I'uitiYl States
The confederate soldiers who are in
mates of the stale home will meet in
front of the Ardmoreite office at 2:4."(
this attcrnoon and will march in a
body to the Palace Theater where they
will sis? the kIiow as the guests of the
Ardmoreite.
"The IJattle Cry of Peace'' is her
alded us a call to urins -not for war
but for peace. It Is designed to arouse
in the heart of every American citizen
a realization of his strict accountabili
ty to his country In time of need.
Scores of prominent Americans in
army, navy and administrative circles
of the United States government havo
contributed to this great production.
Notable among the sponsors and In
dorse of the film are Dr. Lyman
Abbott, former Secretary of War Gar
rison. Major General I-onard Wood
and Admiral George Dewey.
In producing this picture the direct
number of armored motors, dreail
liauglils, submarines, torpedo boats,
etc. are used in this wonderful scene.
It has been said by leading motion
picture critics that the bombardment
of New York Is one of the most seii
satlonal scenes ever filmed. The heart
of New Y'ork Is shown at one of the
city's busiest periods. Wall street is
engrossed in the quotations of tile day,
great railway yards are crowded with
the freight of a prosperous country,
newsboys are yelling baseball extras
and -
There is a flush from one ,f ihrt
coast defense disappearing guns.
Then, is u reply from a battleship far
out in the horizon and right in the
nillle of ln .Ww York a large sec
tion or the Singer building is blown
to pieces and crashes to the pavement.
I.Ike so much sugar the most beauti
ful skyline in the world crumbles lie
fore the firing of a powerful enemy.
Punning through the (Mm is a plot of
exceptional worth and the various
parts of the play are Interpreted by a
number of fllnidom's most noted stars.
In building this massive play, the
author has not overlooked a dash of
comedy here nnd there. He plays a
joke on the uiidbnce when he takes
them for a trip down the chutethe-
ihute at Coney Island. The picture
was taken from the front of the boat
as it goes down the Incline and when
the water Is struck the audience Is
bounced high Into the nir three times.
So realistic Is thie little Joke of the
author's that in many instances per
sons In the audience have been know n '
to grab their seats to keep from being
bounced Into the water.
Xew York, Oct. 2. It appears al
most certain that the opening game
of the world's series will bo played tn

Is all ready.
