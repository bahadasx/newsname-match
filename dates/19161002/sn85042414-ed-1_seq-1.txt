FOURTH RAID IN
THE LAST MONTH
Four Machines Have Been
Brought Down—Num
ber of Fatalities.
London, Oct. 2—The official account
of the raid by ten Zeppelins over
England last night, shows that no
lives were lost and the property dam
age was not great.
One of the Zeppelins, 'which after
being driven off by anti-aircraft Are,
persisted in returning to the north
of London. She was again attacked
and brought to earth, a seething
torch, while the spectators cheered.
A second airship attempted to at
tack London from the northeast, but
was driven off.
Friends of Count Zeppelin were
alarmed when they learned that an
other airship had been brought down
In England last night, says the Am
sterdam correspondent of the Ex
change Telegraph company. The
count intended taking part in the
raid, the correspondent cables, but
the
message sent to Germany elicited
the information that at the last mo
ment, owing to the persuasion of his
family, he decided not to Join the
raiders.
Except for a part of the envelope
there was left hardly any vestige rec
ognizable as a part of the huge air
ship, which was brought down last
night near Pottersbar. The Zeppelin
burned more fiercely than the one
previously destroyed, which, like her,
fortunately, fell in an open field. The
members of the crew were incinerated
and their bodies were scattered over
the field on which the airship alighted
some eighty yards from a farmer's
cottage.
The Zeppelin seemed to remain al
most stationary In the air for three
minutes before the envelope burst
Into flames. TongueB of Are licked
along the bag until it was all ablaze.
Four Zeppelin raids on London and
the east, coast have been carried out
in the last month. On September 2
one Zeppelin was struck while flying
over- the. London district and fell In
flames.
Two Zeppelins were destroyed. In
the raid of September 28. On that oc
casion the raiders killed 88 persons
and wounded 125. The following
night, in another raid, in Which the
airships apparently escaped without
damage, they, killed 36 persons and
wounded 27.
In the raid of September 2, only
two persons suffered death and 13
were injured.
GERMANS JUBILANTOVER
FALKENHAYN'S VICTORY
Defeat of Rumanians at Hermann
stadt Subject of Laudatory Com
ments in Teutonic Press.
Amsterdam, Oct. 2.—(Via London.)
•—The German press is jubilant over
the victory won by General von Fal
kenhayn over the Rumanians at Her
mannstadt. The Cologne Gazette de
scribes it as a feat of the first rank.
It says Lieutenant General Krafft von
Delmensyng, who captured Rothen
sturm Pass behind the Rumanians,
turned the left wing of the Rumanians
in a wide curve with one column. His
troops overcame enormous difficul
ties, crossing pathless mountains, and
had already placed themselves in pos
session of the pass when the frontal
attack near' Hermannstadt began.
The Rumanians attempted vainly to
take counter measures by sending re
inforcements and by attacking further
north with the second army, to lighten
the pressure on the first army at Her
mannstadt.

Hold.
New Tork, Oct. 2.—Fire which
started in the cargo hold of the. Amer
ican Line steamship Philadelphia
Thursday while the vessel was ap
proximately 800 miles from this port,
Btlll was smoldering under a blanket
of steam when she arrived here yes
terday. So successful were the offi
cers and crew in keeping the news
from the 646 passengers, lest there
should be a panic among them that
few were aware of the peril they had
been in until after the big liner
docked.
The first intimation of fire was
when smoke was seen pouring from a
hatch almost directly under the steer
age Mining room aft. The officers re
moved the 343 passengers at once and
took precautions to keep the news
from spreading to. the first and sec
ond cabin passengers. While the
blaze was got under control quickly
no time was lost in steaming to port.
The Philadelphia left Liverpool
Saturday, September 2S. How the fire
Btarted It was said, has not been de
termined.
Among the passengers was George
Gordon Moore of Detroit, Mich.,

British army in France and their al
leged social activities behind the
trenches occasioned criticism in Eng

suit he instituted. Sir Herbert Beer

also was a passenger.

WANTS TO RESIST
ADAMSON STATUTE
New "York, Oct. 2.—Edward P. Rip
ley, president of the Atchison, Tope
ka & Santa Fe railway sent yesterday
to stockholders of the company an
appeal to work for the passage of
remedial legislation to meet the situa
tion created by the passage by con
gress of the eight-hour law.
"This company believes that the act
which congress has passed is uncon
stitutional and that steps should be
taken to resist It In every lawful man
ner," he says in his communication.
After reviewing the negotiations at
Washington leading up to the passage
of the eight-hour law Mr. Ripley calls
attention to the fact that the presi
dent recommended that congress ex
pllclty approve of consideration by
the Interstate commerce commission
of an increase In freight rates to meet
the wage Increase charge resulting
and also prohibit strikes until after
the investigation. The brotherhoods
he said, have made It clear they will
resist such legislation. It appears, he
says, that "until some remedial legis
lation shall be adopted the only way
to avert tie-ups is for congress to
grant by special legislation whatever
demands labor combinations may In
sist upon as their price for permitting
the people to continue to enjoy rail
way transportation."

FAMOUS MEXICAN
REBEL IS KILLED
Mexico City, Oct- 2.—Confirmation
has been received of the report of the
death of Alfonso Santibanez, the slay
er of General Jesus Carranza, brother
of the first chief. Santibanez was
shot and killed by Aurelio Hernandez,
a follower of Felix Diaz, at Zihuattan,
Oaxaca. Word later was received
that Hernandez also had lost his life
in a skirmish with Constitutionalist
troops.
Santibanez, who had been a federal
leader In 1914, in 1915 formed with
his men a part of the command of
General Jesus Carranza on the isth
mus of Tehuantepec. A brother of
Santibanez in opposition to the gov
ernment was captured in the north
and was held for execution. Impell
ed by this fact and by personal am
bitions, Santibanez suddenly seized
Jesus Carranza and his staff, took
them far Into the mountains and held
them for ransom. He demanded of
General Venustiano Carranza that his
brother's life be spared and his own
ambitions gratified, threatening that
if the First Chief did not comply
Jesus Carranza's life would pay the
forfeit.
The First Chief refused to comply,
declaring that it was impossible to
grant the demands even to save his
brother's life. He, however, made an
effort to capture the bandits but was
unsuccessful and Jesus Carranza was
shot against a wall.
