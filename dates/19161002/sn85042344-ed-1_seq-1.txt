LATE COMER FINDS
ROOMS ARE SCARCE
Hotel Facilities Inadequate In Man;
Instances lo ( ni for Ih'liiKil
Arrivals.
The stranger who arrives within tho
gates of the city late at nlg-ht Is sorely
tried to find a place at which ha muv
lay head In comfort. If he finds "risht
off the bat" a clean, comfortable
place, he is Indeed fortunate and the
chances are that ho may have to
tread from pillar to post before tho
1. able to locate any sort of room.
Such Is the crowded condition of this
citv's hos'.elries.
The enormous crowd of transients
which Is always lvre, the tremendous
Influx of newcomers and the "regu
lars" take practically all available
rooms. Tho hotels reach their capac
ity early, and then the rooming
houses and cheaper sort of "fly by
nlrht" places are next filled, room by
room. On n number of occasions men
have been forced lo walk the streets
all night without finding any shelter.
And there Is no immediate relief In
sight. The new hotel facilities have
done little to alleviate the situation. As
the additional hostclries spring up the
tid il wave Increases. Kuslness men
are giving tho situation no little con
sideration at present.

The Monday Morning World
TIIK appearance of the Monday morning Issue of Tho World marks
another slop In the progress of Tulsa. The World has ulways
kept abreast of the times In the development and growth of this won
der city of the southwest, ond the Issuing of a Monday morning paper
Is In line with Us past achievements, Throughout the ten years since
the first Issue of Tho Dally World It Is a matter of considerable ju idii
that Its position as u progressive, forward-looking, up-to-date news
paper has always been recognized both ut home and abroad. Tho
paramount purpose and aim of The World is and always has been
first to produce a newspaper that could and would stand on Its own
legs and which could demand and receive such patronage and support
OS such a policy merited and deserved. It has never failed or faltered
In Its purpose, nor been disappointed In Its hopes and faith In Itself
and In this city. It has never attempted to take advantage of publlo
clamor to advance or sustain its own Interest, nor resorted to tho
somewhat prevalent practice among a certain class of newspapers to
always try and get on the popular side of every question. Its aim Is
to be truthful, accurate and fair yet fearless In tho espousal of any
cause that may In Its judgment cha!lenv;e public discussion and atten
tion, leaving the field of carping criticism and limitless fault-finding
mid person-tilths open to the street-corner reformer and statesman,
realizing that the supply of that kind of talent Is practically inexhaust
ible from the smallest hamlet to the greatest metropolis In thn nation.
The World has unbounden laith In Tulsa, It is u splendid city to
live In. It Is one of the most progressive, bp-to-tho-m!ntito, virllo,
active, go-ahead and "attend to your own business" communities that
lias ever existed in the Fnited Slates. It Is no place for a laggard or a
sluggard, You have got to "hit the ball" and deliver the goods If you
expect to do business In this city, and when you have done that no
fears need be felt of the result. Here, too, has developed an excep
tionally strong community spliit that no amount of knocking or
heckling can destroy.
The World is willing to stake what reputation It lias as a prophet
and prognostlrator of the future growth of this city, on the predlc
' tlon which It here and now makes, that when the next federal census
Is taken Tulsa will have a population In excess of 75,000, and that
It will be the largest iiiul most Important city between St. Louis and
Jos Angeles, Kansas City niul Dallas. It Is upon tho record of the
past achievements of Tulsa, Its present phenomenal growth and as
sured future that Tin' World nutlet lakes the launching of a Monday
morning Issue and It will be rlgnt there on your front doorstep sovon
days ou( of the week to tell you every morning the story of Its faith In
the town, together with the news of the world, and to do Its full
sharo to push along tho highway of progress Its part of the load each
day.
