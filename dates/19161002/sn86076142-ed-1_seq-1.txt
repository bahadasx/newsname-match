broke out In the cargo hold of the
American line steamship Philadel

were aware of the peril they had
been In until after the big liner was
docked.
The first Intimation of fire was
when smoke was soon pouring from
a hatch under the steerage dining

removed the 345 steerage passengers
at once and took precautions to keep
the news from spreading. While the
blaze was got under control quickly,

of the fire has not been determined.

The summary by H. Legler, the local
observer, shows that there was 97

Bjr Associate Preaa.)
Successful resumption of the Rus

draws attention to a new eastern war
theater, wherein operations have been
apparently of small Importance since
the drive against Lemberg which was
held some time ago. Berlin and
Vienna concede that advantages have
been gained by the Russians, who are
attacking from the northeast and
southeast of the Galician capital, gain
ing ground south of Brezany In the
latter district and along the Brody
Zlochoff road in the former district.

Germans have been driven from
positions near Stuff redoubt and also
bave been forced to give up all except
a very small portion of the Schwaben
redoubt in this region. Between Lea
Ars and Flers, the British have
pushed forward. Saturday night and

and Clery fell to the French.
Berlin reports, however, that at

. In Galicia, Russians have started
another big offensive. The official
reports from Petrograd and Berlin
are at variance as to results of the
fighting. ,j
Petrograd reports that thirty miles
northeast of Lemberg the Russians
are forcing their way forward and
have captured 1987 officers and men.
Also south .of Brzezany, 50 miles
southwest of Lemberg, and along the

Berlin asserts that Russian forces
along the Brody Lemberg railroad

sians gained a foothold In the south
and also advanced between the Tsenl
uvka and Zlota-Lipa river.
In the Carpathians, in the Ludowaz
sector, the Austrians have turned to
the offensive, and, according to
Vienna, in an attack captured four
Russian officers and 532 men and
eight machine guns.
Thee Rumanian theater is witness

number of prisoners taken by the
army of General Von Falkenhayn In
the Hermannstadt region exceeds
3000.

LONDON (official), Oct. 2. Ten
Zeppelins took part last night In a

to attack London. One was driven

80 yards from a farmer's cottage.
Friends of Count Zeppelin were
alarmed when tbey heard that an

last moment, owing to persuasion ot
the family, the count remained ' at
home.
The destroyed Zeppelin appeared to
remain almost stationary In the air
for three minutes after It burst Into
flame. A tongue of fire seemed to
lick along the bag until it was com
pletely ablaze. Even then It dropped
so slowly that many persons who had
not awakened until, the cheering
aroused them were able to reach their
windows in time to see it 'fall.
Neither airship, the one destroyed
nor the second one - which attacked
