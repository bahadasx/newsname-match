I Russians Make New Drive on 1 1
Lemberg and Defeat Austrians I
Heavy Engagements
in Progress Southeast
i of Galician Capitol
' , Successful resumption by the Rus
sians of their offenslvo In Gallcla
draws attention anew to the eastern
war theater In which the operations
have been apparently of comparative
ly small Importance since General
Brusslloff's drive for Lemberg was
held up some time ago.
S Vienna and Berlin concede that ad-
: vantages have been gained by the
Russians, who are attacking from both
i northwest and southwest of the Gall-
! clan capital and have gained ground
south of Brezezany in tho latter dis
trict and along the Body-ZIochoff road
in the former.
On the southeastern front in Mace
donia tho British have maintained the
advances scored in their attack Satur
fe. day near the Struma, beating off Bul
garian counter attacks and retaining
tho two villages captured along the
road to Seres, according to London
today.
The forward movement along the
Struma synchronizes with a Serbian
success on the westerly Macedonian
front. Tho long continued struggle In
the Kalmakcalan district has resulted
in the Serbians not only securing pos
session of tho principal heights In tho
region southeast of Monastir, but in
an advance of more than a mile north
of the main road where tho village
of Kotchovc has been taken.
Recent operations by the French
along tho Sommo front appear to have
been mostly in the nature of minor at
tacks, probably preparatory to some
larger movement in the Peronno re
gion, while tho British main effort
has been directed to tho thruust to
ward Bapaumo along the road from
Pozlores, where an advance on the
front of more than a milo and a half
was announced by London last night.
Austrian Counter Attack Falls.
Petrograd, Oct. 2, via London, 11:15

TEN ZEPPELINS
RAID ENGLAND
Two Airships Attempt At
tacks on London One De
stroyed, Second
Driven Off.
London, Oct. 2, 11:25 a. m. Ten
Zeppelins took part In last night's raid
over England. Two of them attempt
ed to attack London. One was driven
away and the othef was destroyed.
An official account of tho raid fol
lows: "Ten airships crossed the east
coast last night between 9 o'clock and
1 midnight. One airship approached
the north of London at about 10 p. m.,
but was driven off by gunfire and pur
sued by aeroplanes. She attempted to
return from the northwest, but was at
tacked by guns and aeroplanes and
brought to earth in flames near Pot
ter's Bar, shortly before midnight.
"A second airship attempted to at
tack London . from the northeast and
was driven off. Bombs w,ere dropped.
No reports of casualties or damage
have yet been received.
"The remaining airships wandered
aimlessly over the eastern counties.
In Lincolnshire bombs were dropped
promiscuously, most of them in open
country without doing damage." I
Friends of Count Zeppelin were
alarmed when they learned that an
other airship had been brought down
in England last night, says the Am
sterdam correspondent of the Ex
change Telegraph company. The
count intended to take part in the
raid, the correspondent cables, but a
message sent to Germany elicited tho
information that at the last moment,
owing to the persuasion of his family
he decided not to join tho raiders.
Zeppelin Burns Fiercely.
Except for part of the envelope
there Is left hardly a vestago recog
nizable as part of the huge airship
which was brought down last night
near Potter's Bar. The Zeppelin
burned more fiercely than the one
previously destroyed, which, like her,
fortunately fell in an open field.
The members of the crew were in
cinerated and the bodies scattered
oyer the field on which the airship
alighted some 80 yards from a farm
er's cottage.
The Zeppelin appeared to remain al
most stationary in the air for three
minutes after the envelope burst into
flames. The tongues of fire seemed to
lick along the bag until it was all
ablaze. Even then, it dropped so
slowly that many persons who had
not awakened until tho cheering
aroused them, were able to reach
their, windows In time tb see it fall.
Neither the airship which was de
stroyed nor the second one which at
tacked London succeeded in penetrat
ing the outer defenses of the capital.
Little or no damage was done by
either of them, or by the eight others
who operated over eastern counties.
One person was killed and one in
jured In the raid. The material dam
ago was small.
"Police reports show that the total
casualties In last night's raid were one
man killed and ono woman injured,"
says an official statement made pub
lic this afternoon. "The material
damage was Insignificant, although
tho raiders covered a wide area and
dropped a great number of bombs.
Four houses were seriously damaged.
Some glass houses were demolished
and a number of windows were
broken."

Washington, Oct. 2. Financing of
