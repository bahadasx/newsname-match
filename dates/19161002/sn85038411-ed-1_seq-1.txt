the crossing of the Pennsy tracks at
State street, and the proposed plans
for widening of Walnut, Third and
North streets.
Mr. Herman's Letter
"We are confidently hoping,con

I am with you deeply interested
In the proper working out of this
entire project, with a view to
making Capitol Park and its ex
tension an integral unit in the de
velopment of a beautiful Harris

mean a beautiful Capitol.

reveal tny of his future plans for de
veloping the recently purchased Steel

to "taK about that this evening."
He isked the reporter many ques
! tions about the city and expressed |
I much interest in what he was told
about'the community's plans for pub
lic mprovements, particularly the
j plan for floating the big new high

eri for the city the steel magnate

pleasure when told that this evening's

Milk Famine Caused by
Deadlock of Dairymen and
Distributors Hits N. Y. Hard
New York, Oct. 2. —The first effects
of a milk famine were felt here to-day
as the result of the deadlock between
dairymen arid distributors over the
price the former shall receive for their
product. It was estimated that milk
trains brought to this city last night
<IOO,OOO less than the usual 2,500,000 i
quarts.
The milk companies announce, that
j hospital and homes in which there are '
children who are ill will receive first
consideration and for the present will
obtain a full supply. Some of the milk
now arriving here is coming from
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Illinois and
Canada.

GREAT STEEL KING
HERE TODAY STILL
'CHARLIE' TO FRIENDS
WHENEVER I talk with Charlie
Schwab for tlv-e minutes 1 have
an irresistible impulse to grab
my hat, rush out and do something,"
said a friend of the steel master the
other day. "His enthusiasm electrifies
one." says Merle Crowell in the Sep
tember American Magazine.
My first impression of Mr. Schwab
was exactly that. It came on a cold
night last winter, when the moonlit
snow lay still as silver around his man
sion of cream granite and stone on
Riverside Drive, New York city. Wait
ing in his art gallery, I was studying
one of Rosa Bonheur's ptUntings when
a man came through the door at my
left. It was the Steel King.
As we sat down I began to have the
feeling that had come with my first
visit to a power plant. Tall, solid, but
tinglingly alive, Mr. Schwab seemed the
shelter for some tremendous force,
some current with a How as constant
as a dynamo's. I thought of the great
steel mills on the banks of the Lehigh,
where twelve years ago a few half
deserted buildings were waiting to be
strippeil of machinery, and I began to
understand the industrial miracle of
Bethlehem. There was something as
drlvlngly irresistible in the man as
there is in his Cyclopean plants, which
lead the world in the output of arma
ment and fine steel. Yet his brown
eyes were very kind, and his voice—
I have never listened to a man with
a voice as friendly as the steel mas
ter's. It has none of the nasal reso
nance so common among Americans.
'lt is at; soft as velvet and as clear as
tungsten steel. It compels confidence.
For nearly sixteen years Mr. Schwab

has been known as America's greatest
salesman. To talk with him is to
understand why. With the background
of that evening, I was ready to appre
ciate a story which I heard later.
Seveial years ago, in the midst of
the development of his Bethlehem
Steel Company, Mr. Schwab found it
important to sell some notes. So he
went to a financier. With his cus
tomary enthusiasm the magnate
sketched the happy condition of the
steol industry and the bigger things
just around the corner. So well did
he present his case that the light of
Bethlehem's furnaces might have betu
borrowed from the rainbow.
"Why, there won't be any trouble
selling those notes," said the financier.
And the steel man went happily back
to his New York office. A little later
he was called to the telephone.
"Mr. Schwab" (It was the financier
speaking), "would you mind dictating
in a letter Just what you said to me?"
So the .steel magnate dictated a let
ter and took it over to him.
"Why. Mr. Schwab, that isn't the
same thing at all," said the man of
money.
"Yes, it Is," protested Bethlehem's
president.
They went over the letter together,
and tho financier was forced to admit
that it contained exactly what Mr.
Schwab had said.
"Well," he said, "you're right, but I
can't sell those notes unless you dictate
that talk into a phonograph."
In ISO", at the age of thirty-five,
Charles M. Schwab became president

British Nearer Baupaumc;Ger
man L-Boat in Arctic Sinks
Three Steamers
Successful resumption by the Rus
sians of the offensive In Galicia draws
attention anew to the eastern war
theater In which the operations have
been partly of comparatively small
importance since General Brussiloff's
dri\e for Letnberg was held up some
time ago.
Berlin and Vienna concede that ad
vantages have been gained by the Rus
sians who are attacking from both
i northeast and southeast of the Gali
i " capital and have gained ground
south °f Brzezany in the latter district
and along the Brody-Zlochoff road in
the former.
On the southeastern front in Mace
donia the British have maintained the
advances scored in their attack Satur
day near the Struma, beating off Bul
garian counter attacks and retaining
the two villages captured along the
road to Seres, according to London to
day.
Serbs Win Great Victory
The forward movement along the
Struma synchronizes with a Serbian
success o nthe westerly Macedonian
front. The long continued struggle in
the Kaimakcalan district has resulted
in the Serbians not only securing pos
session of the principal heights on the
region southeast of Monastir, but in
| an advance of more than a mile north
I of the main peak where the village of
Kotchovie has been taken.
Recent operations by the French
along the -Homme front appear to have
been mostly in the nature of minor at
tacks, probably preparatory to some
larger movement in the Peronne re
gion, while the British main effort has
been directed to the thrust toward Ba
paume along the road from Pozieres,
where an advance on a front, of more
than a mile and a half was announced
by London last night. Paris to-day
reports a French success in a local
operation east of Bouchavesnes north
of Peronne, where a trench and some
prisoners were captured.
