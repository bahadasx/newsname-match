I Wilson's Real
Views About
Union Labor
(Extract from speech made by
lS 1 Theodore Itoosevelt at Hattlo
W rCreek, Saturday, September 29).
I At the People* Forum on
| February 2, 1905, Mr. Wilaon
' . eald:
ij "Labor Unions drag the hlgh'
est man to the level of the low'
M '? >? it . Ji.
1 ner in the Waldorf-Astoria on
March 18, 1907. In speaking of
the capitalists, he said: "There
is another equally formidable
enemy to equality and betterment
of opportunity, an< that
is the class formed by tie la-,
bor organizations and lexers*
of this country." In a letter
written January 12, 1909, he
j said: "I am a fierce partisan
i of the open shop." In June
[ of the same year, speaking at
Princeton, he said: "The usual
standard of the employee in
our day is to glvo as little as
he may for his wages. Labor
is standardized by the trades
unions and this is the standard
to which it is made to conform.
I need not point out how
economically disastrous such a
regulation of labor Is. The labor
of America Is rapidly becoming
unprofitable under this
regulation. Our economic supremacy
may be lost because
the country grows more and
more full of unprofitable servants."
I have no question that when
Mr. Wilson thus spoke he expressed
his sincere convictions.
Less than two year3 later
he was in public life and
immediately his attitude
changed. There Is no reason
to believe that his convictions
changed.

Issues Statement Defending
the Payments Which
Cornwell Criticises.
i By Associated Press)
CHARLESTON, \V. Va.. Sept. SO,
19 LB.?"A cowardly refusal was the
comment of Governor llattield today
in a statement given out replying to
: John J. Coruwell, Democratic nomineo
i for Governor, who refused last night
i to accept the challenge issued by Gov!
crnor Hatiield for a series of joint dis,
cussions on the issues that have been
raised by Cornwell in attacking the
record of the Republican state administration.
Cornwell'B reason assigned
for declining was that he was "too
much occupied" to accept the challenge
and that he did not desire "to
undertake the burden of securing for
the Governor audiences before which
; to defend his administration."
Governor Hatfield brands the Cornwell
alibi as a weak defense and de' lares
that it is "palpably insincere on
is face." He charges Cornwell with
i 'ing afraid to meet him in joint distsion
and ridicules his plan as a
>: rawing card for crowds."
lie lays down the gauntlet to Cornwell.
charging him with making malicious
statements and unjustified insinuations
about certain expenditures
from the civil contingent fund. Ho also
charges Cornwell and delics him to
deny that he is riding about the state
on railroad and Pullman passes, and
putB the question to the Democratic
candidate for Governor as > his opinion
of the propriety of such action.
In regard to payment made in connection
wtih the legislative bribery
cases to Guy B. Biddinger of $1,957.84.
Governor Hatfield gives out (n his
statement th letter in which Judge
William S O'Brien, a Democrat, who
presided at the trial, approved the

Buraing 'Structure Appeared
to Stand Still For ..
Long Time.
(By A."nclnted Press.!
LONDON, Oct. 2.?Ten Zeppelin!
took part in last night's raid ovei
England, two ot them attempted to ;t;|
attack London. One was driven away
and the other was reported last night
as destroyed. No reports of casual!'
ties have been received, following li
an official account of the raid:
"Ton airships crossed the eas'
coast last night between 9 o'cloel
and midnight. One airBhip approached
the north of London at about 1(
p. m. and was driven off by gunfire
and pursued by aeroplanes. She attempted
to return from tho northwest,
but was attacked by guns and />
aeroplanes and brought to earth In
llames In the nelghobrhood of Potter's
Bar shortly before midnight. A '
second airship atttcmpted to attack
London from the northeast and was
driven off. Bombs were dropped. Mo
reports of casualitles or damage have
been received. The remaining airship
wandered aimlessly over the
eastern counties. In Lincolnshire 5
bombs were dropped promiscuously.
Most of them appear to hare been
dropped in open country without doing
damage. The airship destroyed *4
was of the latest type." " *1
"friends of Count ZgjwellA^irer*.. *>
alarmed when they learned that another
airship had been brought down ' r
In England last night," says the Amsterdam
correspondent of the Ex- g
change Telegraph company. The
Count intended to take part in the
raid, the correspondent cabled, but
a message sent to Germany elicited
the information that at the last moment
owing to the persuasion of his
'aiuily he decided not to join the raiders.
Except for part of the envelope a
there is left hardly a vestige recog- ;
nizable of the hugh airships brought a
down Inst nlfht noo* w?
uvui ui uti a uai.
The Zeppelin burned more fiercely
than one previously destroyed, which
like her fortunately fell in an open
field. The members of the crew were i
Incinerated and the bodies scattered
over the field on which the airship 5
alighted, 80 yards Trom a farmer's
cottngc. The Zeppelin appeared to 'J
remain almost stationary in the air . .a
for three minutes after the envelop |
burst into flames. The tongues of fire
seemed to lick along the sides until
it was all ablaze. Even then it
dropped so slowly that many persons
who had not awakened until the 4
cheering aroused them were able to '.Vf
reach their windows in time to see It aBS
fall.
Neither the airship which was de- "J,
stroyed nor the one which attacked
London succeeded in penetrating the
outer defenses or the capital.
Little or no damage was done eith- V
er by them or by eight others which
operated over the eastern counties.
Hint for Bachelors.
"Since I have given my best,thought jl
to the problem I have not found it especially
difficult to take care of my
sister-in-law's two-year-old baby while y
she goes shopping," said the bachelor
brother-in-law. "For a time, until I
mastered the suhect, 1 must confess
that it had me considerably obfuscated.
But now I merely put the dear little
fellow under a tub. weighted down so
that by no possibility can he overset
It, nnd then go out to the barn and read j
