Bridgeport electrical inspection is a
farce, the most dangerous conditions
are known to fire insurance compan
ies to exist in the city, but overlooked
because of the higher rates that are
charged policy holders,, the adminis
tration has repeatedly refused to ap
point an inspector ,to" relieve condi
tions, and the situation now is so bad
that in 24 houses under construction
one firm has put in' outlet boxes for
the protection of houses and another
firm has ripped them out for personal
gain, without opposition from the au
thorities. These are charges made on Thurs
day last tly James Sullivan, business

Workers' union, substantiated In part
by John Hotz of the firm 'of Kilpatrick

ford, e
i Other charges brought before the
convention, to the astonishment of
contractors and underwriters from
other cities and states are to the ef
fect that nearly three-quarters of the
houses In Bridgeport are unsafe from
lack of Inspection; that the outside
