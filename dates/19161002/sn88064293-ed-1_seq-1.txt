BURNING UP MILLIONS
Carelessness Costs Every Man,
man anti Child in the U. S.
a Year
Wo
$5
If you were to go to the bank and
draw out ail your savings in brand
I new bills, and then if you were to
take the money and go and stand in
the middle of the main street of this
city and set fire to the bills, one at
a time, you would find yourself in
the lands of a policeman before you
could say Jack Robinson.
There is no question about the
owner hip of the money. It is yours
to do what you please with. You can
•spend it foolishly, you can give it
away or you can invest it wisely.
But if you burn it up, it is imme
diately assumed that you are crazy,
or at least temporarily mentally un
balanced, and the public feels that
it has a right to restrain you.
Despite this fact, we go on ser
I
. "
whei
enely from year to year burning up
our property without taking the P
s'lightest thought, apparently, of
what we are doing. We erred costly
structures and then sit down and •
wait for them to burn because we
neglect the first principle of fire
prevention.
Gasoline, which is more deadly
than dynamite, vve handle matches
around for the children to play with, i
We hang our lace curtains close to !
:he gas jet and thc-n leave the win
dow open when we go to bed so that
the wind can blow the lace curtain
into the flame.
Statistices for the year 1915 show!
bdter than words the reckless way
in which the American people han
die their property.
There were in 1915 no less than
2,152 individual fires, which in each
instance caused an estimated proper
ty damage of more than $10,000.
The total fire loss for the United
States now averages more than
$250,009,000 a year. In .1515 it
hewed a slight drop, but there is no
believe that this is more
porary, for the loss thus far j at
in 1916 indicate that they will be far j
greater when the year is completed, j
If this $250,000,000 loss were all, j
ould certainly be enough, but j
when this is said only less than, haif |
the story is told. Besides the burning ,
.........
reason to
than tem.c
up of property, we spend every year i
in this country more than $250,000-i F
000 for the upkeep of fire depart-1 ly
ments, and there is additional waste i
in the increased size of insurance |
premium made necessary bv our own ! the
carelessness. i to
° Ut f ° r yourself ' There i
are 100,000,000 people in the United < f
es roug y spea 'ing. The an- ! to
nual fire tax is $500,000,000. | in
p
That means that every man, worn
an and child spends $5 a year more j
to live because of our national care- j
lessness. If the average family con-1
sists of seven, it means that every 1
family bears a burden of $35 a year
because of the fire waste. boll
Ignorance of the fire danger is
stupendous. It is willful ignorance,'
for in ihese days there is no reason !
why anyone should not know, and !
knowing there is no reason why he
should not have at least rudimentary ; f > i°
means of protecting himself. |
Take your own case, for instnee. !
Suppose a fire started in your home !
tonight while you were asleep. What !
means have you at hand to put the 1
fire out? Suppose a fire started this
minute in your home while you are iug
away. How would it be extinguished ion
without the help of the city fire de
partment? Is there an extinguisher
in your house? In ninety-nine cases tion.
out of every hundred it i3 safe to
wager that there is not. ual,
Even negative precautions are not City
taken. People permit rubbish to at- tured
cumulate in piles in their attic, in the
closets, in their cellar.
A p'.le of papers under the stairs took
or in the closet is a first-class fire Mrs.
risk. These places usually are dark,
and when they are visited a match
or a candle is required.

i..g roppe< or the candle being left cure
in ^ en f b e visitors departs. If i
is a closet, the door is shut and ]j r ,*
soon there is a bright little fire :
burning there. j
If the proposition is one careful i
person to ninety-nine careless per-!
sons, wh^t right have those ninety- !
nine to expect the other persons to j
help them pay their fire protection? ;
Should not the careless person be Sale
made for putting out the "fire in his will

un
heme? If the fire spread from his !
home to his neighbor's should he not
pay his neighbor for the loss, where !
the fire was due to his own careless
I ness?
1 he idea of personal responsibil
ity is spreading fast. Pennsylvania
has passed laws on this subject. The
principle has been adopted in New
York City, where the city has col
lected damages in several cases from
owners of buildings that have caught
fire. Owners have been compelled to
pay for the cost, of extinguishing the
fire, for the water, the men's salar
ies. and the rental for the apparatus.
One of these day we will wake up
to the fact that fire loss is a needless
waste. The people of Europe have
long ago discovered it.
