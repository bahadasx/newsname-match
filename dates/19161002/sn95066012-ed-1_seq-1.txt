Whether Brooklyn, Philadelphia or
Boston wins the National, the classic

hold on first place, did not play the
baseball the team showed during July
and early August. Against Chicago
in two games on Monday Brooklyn
broke even. On Tuesday and Wed

Mexican border and on the splendid
manner in which they acquitted them
selves while in that service. The high
standard and efficiency which has al
ways been the pride of Vermont sol
diers has been splendidly sustained by
them and they well deserve and should
heartily receive the thanks of the
State and nation.
SOUTHERNERS LIGHTER
Than
Their Northern Brothers
By
Four to Six Pounds.
Washington, D. C, Sept. 28. The
average weight of men south of the
Mason and Dixon line is from four to
six pounds lighter than the average
weight of men north of it, say United
States marine corps recruitiug officers
operating there, in a report received ut
marine corps headquarters today.
These recruiting officers have asked
that the minimum weight for recruits
in the south be reduced from 124 to
120 pounds, stripped.
"The large, raw-boned southerner"
Is seldom seen, the recruiting officers
aver, and, while the men of the South
are as soiuid and fit as the men of any
other section, they are usually small
boned and light in weight. The offi
cers point out in their recommenda
tion that some of the best "hikers"
and fighters in the marine corps are
the lean, wiry men from the southland.

FIGHTING THE HESSIAN FLY.
Lata Planting on Fly Free Date Hat
Proved Successful.
That the Hessian fly can be success
fully controlUMl by practical methods
bns been demonstrated in Harvey coun
ty, Kan. Under the leadership of F.
P. Lane, county agent for the Harvey
county farm lmreau, a large number
of farmers were organized last sniu
mer and fall to fight the fly.
Methods of control advocated by Mr.
Lane were those devised nml recom
mended by the department of entomol
ogy in the Kansas State Agricultural
college to thoroughly prepare the seed
bed. destroy the volunteer wheat and
plant on or about tlio'lly frte date,
which in Harvey county U Oct. 8 or II.
A large per cent of tho wheat acreage
of the county wis planted according
to these directions, although tho weath
er conditions hindered the work consid
erably. A representative of the college de
pnrtment of entomology visited n num
ber of vvhenffields in tho county beforo
harvest Iiir began. In nearly every
case where the crop was planted ac
cording to tiie method 4 advocated there
was practically no fly dnjury. A few
fields that were planted before the fly
free date or in which no effort wn4
made to destroy the volunteer wheat
were all badly infested nud the yield
reduced. In some enseR -where Into
sown fields adjoined stubble lields or
early sown fields considerable injury
was noted, showing the necessity of
co-operation In tho control of the fly.
' An experiment was carried out on
the farm of Frank Lnwton, near New
ton, to show the value of planting
wheat on or about the fly free date.
A Hut of wheat was planted each
week, beginning Kept. 20 and continu
ing until Oct. 2?. The plots planted
on Sept. 20, Sept. 27 and Oct. 4 were
almost entirely destroyed by 1 he-fly.

tive' of Shaftsoury and who has been
employed at the H. C. White factory

correct one.
