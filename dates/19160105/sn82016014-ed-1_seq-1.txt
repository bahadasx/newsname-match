Kabbi Makes Plea for Jewish Victims j

Kansas City, Mo.. Jan. 5. A plea
for the suffering Jews of Europe was
made by Rabbi Leon Harrison, of St.
Louis, to the Federation of Jewish
Charities at their annual dinner here
last night. He told or the courage of
the Jews in the vanguard of the Rus
sian army and how their wives, moth
ers and sisters were insulted in the
very country for which they were
fighting.
"The greatest war of history is rag
ing now." he said. "In the awful area
swept by cannon fire on either side of
the battle front, between Teuton and
Slav are nearly 6,000.000 human be
ings that are Jews. The expulsion of
.lews from Poland was accomplished
with unexampled cruelty. Half a mil
lion Polish Jews wan tier in beggary

with mutely pleading eye he show

They brought this little pet along

peaceful ship had time to feed the

Hhounh the squirrel was a joke,

CLEAR SHIPPING INTERESTS
Denounces Roosevelt for Fail

Charged Wilson-Bryan Conniv

Washington, Jan. 5. Charge circu
lated during the last session of con
gress that administration officials act
ed in the Interest of foreign business
firms in urging the passage of the gov
ernment ship purchase bill, were held
to be baseless in majority and minority
reports filed today by the senate com
mittee appointed to investigate them.
Both reports also found the shipping
interests blameless of illegal activity
in opposition lo the measure. The
majority denounced Theodore Roose
velt for failing to appear before the
committee to testify concerning his
published assertion that President
Wilson and Secretary Bryan had en
deavored in the interest of certain for

United States the power to purchase
interned ships of one of the belliger

its origin "in that ungenerous trait of
the human mind which makes it prone
to attribute unworthy motives to re
doubtable rivals and particularly po

After Advertising Another Suit
in the Gas Case
It Derides to Stand on Those It
Has Already Started.
After advertising; in the administra
tion organ (out of tune) that suit
would be filed to compel the Kansas
Natural Gas company to furnish ade
quate gas, Joseph L. Bristow's puhlio
utilities commission today changed its
mind. No suit will now be filed. It
was stated.
Some months airo the court was
asked to compel the Kansas Natural
to furnitm more gas. No more gas
was furnished. So the commission's
legal department contemplated a sec
ond action. The action was to cover
the same ground as that outlined in
the former suit. Details ot the plan
to force the gas company to act were
fully advertised in the administration
paper and drew first column, first
page, next to pure reading: matter.
At a conference today, however, tt
was agreed that & second suit for
more gas would probably bring; no
greater results than benefits derived
from the original action. So the case
was dropped. The commission wilt
now content Itself with a plea to keep
the gas company out of the federal
courts and under the Jurisdiction of
the state tribunals
