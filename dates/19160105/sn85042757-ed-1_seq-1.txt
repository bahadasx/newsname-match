WAR SITUATION,
WAR AS THE YEAR ENDS.
While the Central Powers Have Suffered
They Have Won More Than
They Have Lost.
For the enemies of Germany the year
is ending badly on the held of battle.
In Mesopotamia a British array is re
treating to escape destruction. In
Macedonia an Anglo-trench force is
falling back from Serbian territory,
having failed to succor the gallant
Slave and being now in danger itself.
Allied prestige is shattered in the Near
East and shaken in the t ar East.
Looking back over the twelve months
it is impossible to view them as other
than months in which German success
in the held has rivaled that of Napole
on or Louis XIV. Poland, Serbia, and
Lithuania have been conquered, a road
hfis been opened to Constantinople and
to the Osmanh ally, and Bulgaria has
been persuaded to cast her lot with the
Central Powers.
On the west, half a dozen Allied at
tacks have been halted ; and the battle
lines remain but little changed since
the closing shots of the Battles ot
Flanders put a term to German offen
sive effort in France and in Belgium.
In half a dozen places the Allies have
made progress. They have takep. vil
lages and hills. North of Arras and
cast ot Rheirns they have progressed
for several miles. But these advances
have been meaningless, save as they
have indicated an ever-growing Anglo
French strength and have established
the conviction in Paris and London
that the deadlock in the west can be
broken, when ammunition is available
in sufficient quantities.
But east and west it is necessary to

gium she undertook to hold her enemies
in check and she has held them. In
Russia she planned to take Warsaw and
roll back the Russian masses tromthe
Carpathians to the Niemen and beyond,
and she has done this. Finally, she
broke new ground in a campaign to the
Golden Horn ; and here she has accom
plished with ease and rapidity that
fullest measure of possible success,
which was denied her in Russia as It
had been in France in 1914.
As the year closes it shows Germany
and her allies still triumphant, in bet
ter military posture than a year ago
AMri .nri.nrarftd only by economic pres-
vi d
sure within her boundaries and a pros
n,o shortage in numbers, by no
means assured and not yet revealed on
the linng line.
What is the Allied statement ior the
twelve months'.' First oi all, the Ger
man advance in the west has been per
manently checked. Neither in Pans
nor Berlin is there the faintest thought
that a new campaign will carry the
Germans to Paris or to the Channel.
The destruction Prance and the ap
proach to Britain are no longer possi
hihtle. of the war. Superiority in
men and munitions on the western
front is assured to the Allies for the
period of the war.
.The security of France and Great
Britain thus made certain, the work of
the British fleet has shone forth in
full splendor. German commerce is.a
thing ot the past; and Germany is to
all intents and purposes a beleagured
fortress, not yet perhaps facing starva
tion, but plainly suffering from a
shortage of certain kinds of food, and
many of the materials needed to make

In sum, the passing year has seen the
German failure to win in the west
made absolute. It has also seen the
collapse of the effort, by sumbarine
activity, to blockade Britain, and thus
to free German commerce. It has seen

Grassy Cove
To Be Held in Nashville, May 3, to Nom
inate Candidates for Governor,
U. S, Senate and Choose Del
egates to the National
Convention.
The republican state committee met
in Nashville Thursday and designated
May 3 as the date for"hoiding the state
convention to nominate a candidate for
governor, United States senate and
elect delegates to the national conven
tion that convenes in Chicago, June 7.
The convention will be held in the
house ot representatives, capitol build
ing, on date named.
Aside from selecting the tour dele
gates at large to the national conven
tion there will also be selected the us
ual alternates. Ihe convention will be
called to order at 11 o'clock a. m. At
this time everything seems very har
monious and the outlook tor a united
party is good.
Former Governor Ben W. Hooper is
spoken of as the most likely candidate
for United states senate and John W.
Overall seems to be the leading candi
date for the gubernatorial race.
The basis of representation is fixed
by the total votepeast in 1912 for both
Roosevelt and Tatt. All republicans
are to be recognized regardless of how
thev voted in 1012. This county will
have its customary tour votes in the
convention. We take the following
from the call ss issued by the state
committee :
"All republicans are cordially invited
to meet together in the various coun
ties of this state and take part in the
selection of delegates to this convention.
purpose of seieetT A delegates to at
tend this convention shall be held un
der the call issued from the various
counties' committees at sucn umes as
the said county committees may deem
proper; provided, however, that the
county conventions called for the pur
pose of selecting delegates to attend
said state convention shail not be held
earlier than the first Monday in Febru
ary, 1956, and not later than the third
Monday in'April, 1016.

Three Millions of Men Locked in Death
Struggle on Galacian Front
There has been little activity on the
western battle front and that the usual
artillery duels, mining and sappinga
that brings no particular advantage to
either side.
On the eastern front on the border
between Russia and Austria there are
three millions of men locked in a death
struggle in the most terrific battle of
the entire war. The fight has been in
progress tor three days and no infor
mation of importance has been received
from either side. Such meagre new?
as has been received has come from
Russia and indicates the tight is going
favorable to them.
Thursday of last week a submarine
sank a British liner, Persia, in the
eastern Mediterranean and it i.i thought
over 200 persons were lost, among the
number being Robert N. Neely, United
States consul at Aiden. He was on his
way to his post. The vessel is thought
to have been sunk by an Austrian sub
marine v ithout giving any warning.
The vessel carried very heavy mails
and passengers and crew to the number
nt ahmit 260. It is felt this act will
possibly render adjustment of differ
ences over tne Aneona snmms;, iu
which Americans lost their lives.
Sunday two British ships, Oswald and
Glengyle, were sunk in the Mediter
ranean, but most of the persons aboard
were saved. The Glengyle was built
in 1914, and she went down on her sec
ond voyage.
