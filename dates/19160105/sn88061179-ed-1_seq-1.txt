Buy Interest in Black Moun?
tain Coal.
Although unwilling to be
interviewed concerning the
details, Benjamin L'. Dutuuey,
head of the Black Mountain
Coal Lands Corporation. Mon?
day admitted Hint lie had sold
a large iotorbst in the Muck
Mountain CoUlliolJ, in Lee
county. Virginia, one of the
largest measures of fuel and
coking coal in the south.
"It is true," Mr. Dulnuey
Haid, "thai t i. <? Uy-i'roducts
Qoke .Corporation lias purchas?
ed an interest in the Black
Mountain Corporation, and the
new purchasers, who represent
important capital in Chicago
and Syracuse, N. V., uro to
operate, t he properties on u large
scale, not only for thuir western
markets; but through the port
at Charleston, S. C, for their
eastern markets."
Mr. Dulaney ad mitt od that
ho will retire from the presi
doncy of thi- corporation early
in January. In this connection
ho is given credit for having
been instrumental in making
Charleston a public, instead of
a private port for coal ship?
ments, and his services to the
Southwest Virginia coalfields in
Ulis respect caii hardly bo esti?
mated. Until tliis was done it
was not possible for Southern
coal operations to complete with
Kastern coal operators in reach?
ing markets by water.
Mr. UUIanoy made the light
before the Interstate Commerce
Commission that brought to
light the cHfHcnUioH under
which Southwest Virginia coal
operators were placed in respect
to reaching the markets of the
country and the world. With
import ut Charleston for the
easy and convenient loading of
coal, the Southwest Virginia
lields were tied out of all im?
portant markets reached by
water. As u result of the in?
vestigation, the Southern Hail
way got. busy in an effort to
establish at Charleston a pier
that would hot lie in the nature
of a private dock, but a public
one, and open to all shippers of
coal who pare to reach out for
the eastern markets and for the
markets reached by the ocean
vessels of ull countries.
This great pier is now ready
for coal shipments, and it opens
it way whereby the new owners
of the Black Mountain coalfield
may ship their coal by water in
competition with the big coal
corporations of the east, who
have heretofore had the South?
west Virginia coalfields in a
manner sewed up.
Mr. Dulunoy, when hoch, was
leaving for n brief visit trip
east, from the east he will go
directly 10 his winter home in
Florida, where he expects to re
main with his family until
spring, lie was in the best, of
spirits, lie takes an optimistic
view of the business situation,
and seems thoroughly convinc?
ed that an era of big develop?
ments awaits this section as
one of the things of the immedi?
ate future.
Uo is impressed that the by-!
products plants now being'
established in this region, and
others soon to bo established, of |
themselves bespeak a new era,
in wluu they mean that practi
cully ull natural resources arc
to yield double ami triple their
former value under primitive
methods of development. In
the coal und in ull vegetable
mutter are stored elements that
have heretofore been destroyed
as utterly useless, but some of
which have been found to be of
fur greutor value than the pro?
ducta that have been utilized.
This bus been found true of
woods from which acids have
been extracted for tunning, ex?
plosives, etc. The lifeless pulp
from which these juices have
been extracted, bus now been
found of value in making paper,
and may bo used even more
economically than the wood iu
its native state. On the other
band, woods taken in their
native aluto for puper making
are cupublu of yielding their
ucids for other purposes before
being used in the process of
making paper;
Thu program of the new pur?
chasers of the Black Mountain
cou)field has not yet beeti made
public. However, it is antici?
pated th.it it not only means
that coal will be mined on an
extensive scale, Inn that large
quantities of it will be reduced
tu coke, while the by-products
of the coke will he used in the
making of dyestutfs ami for all
other purposes for which the
same are used in accordancej
with hew scientific develop
meiils. The company installed
there some months ago a large
electric power plain, anil the]
Nameis being used to operate
all the mines of the tegion by
electric power, the old, auto
quilted steam pi,tuts being relo
g.ited to the roar, and few of

.Mr. Dulnhey said that a little
later he would probably be in
a position to speak with more
(leiiniteness concerning what
is in store for the Black Moun?
tain coalfield, but that for good
reasons, ponding the develop?
ment of plans, he was not in a
position to go into details.

The Big Stone (iap Band was
out Friday night for the first
lime, to celebrate the coming in
of the new year.
The band began pluyini; near
the town hall and played sever?
al times in different parts of
town. The playing seemed
very appropriate as many par
ties were being held, and the
music was just in time tobe]
enjoyed by those participating.
As the boys have been prac-'
ticing for only a short time, the
music surpassed the expecta?
tions of many who heard it.
Muny who heard the band are
sure that iu a few months we
?vill have a good band in Big
Stone Gap.

Plant Celery.
We wish to suggest to our
farmers, particulaly our truck?
ers, that they plant out a small
plat of celery in their richest
tnoiatest soil. A great deal of
this delicious, healthy plant is
consumed in the County, ami
very little of it grown for mar?
ket purposes. It is possible to
realize a net profit of suveral
hundred dollars per acre on
this crop. During the fall anil
winter seasons the grocery men
of Wise, buy from but of the
County large quantities of
celery and yet they do not sup?
ply the demand.
We have seen as flue celery
grown by Cupt. J. F. Bullitt,
\V. li. Roberts,JesseMcLemore
and other residents of the
County us can be grown any
where.
Our climate being cool, much
of the soil low and moist and a
good market within the County
makes celery growing for a
prolit it very attractive under?
taking.
The Beeil should be sown in
trays during the winter ami
early spring and the trays kept
in doors as long as the weather
is hail. The plants should bo
rose) into specially prepared
beds covered with glass where
thoy are- allowed to grow until
such tune as the weather will
permit of them being planted
in the garden or Held. It is
very essential to get seed that
will germinate with vigor and
make a rapid growth. For full
