SCHOOL BUILDING
IN GOOD CONDITION
FOR COURT HOUSE
Architects Say Clearwater County
Could Not Secure Similar Building
for $20,000.
COUNTY TO ONLY PAY
$10,000 FOR BAGLEY SCHOOL
Clearbrook Residents Ask Injunction
So That They Can Open Fight
for County Seat.
(By Special Correspondent.)
Bagley, Minn Jan 5 By apply
ing for an injunction against the buy
ing of the school house at Bagley to
be used as a court house by the coun
ty commissioners, residents of Clear
brook have opened the fight for the
county seat. For years residents of
Clearbrook have been wanting the
county seat from Bagley.
Everyone Satisfied.
No other village has made any
claim for the seat and everyone with
the exception of the residents of
Clearbrook appear to be satisfied
with the present location.
Tne purcnasmg of a new court
house, however, would stand in the
way of changing the county seat, so
the injunction has been asked for
by the residents of Clearbrook
Needs New Building.
Clearwater county, as has been
pointed out in the Pioneer, is very
much in need of a court house, the
present wooden structure being in
adequate in many ways and being a
fire risk.
The offer by the county commis
sioners of $10,000 and site for Inde
pendent School Distiict No 2 build
ing in Bagley was considered by
many as being a wise move for both
the county and the school district. At
a special election the school district
by a large vote accepted the offer of
the county.
Hearing Jan. 13.
The hearing on the injunction will
be heard before Judge C. W. Stanton
ot the district court, January 13.
That the school building is in good
shape and can be fitted out for use
as a court house by expending $2,725
is the report of Architects George
Hamery of Gonvick and Lutz
of Thief River Falls The report is
as follows:
To the Honorable Board of County
Commissioners, Clearwater County,
Bagley, Minnesota.
Gentlemen: Pursuant to your or
der of Dec 7, 1915, appointing us to
make an examination of the present
Bagley, Minnesota, school building,
to ascertain its condition, the esti
mated cost of vault construction, re
arrangement and finishing work nec
essary to adapt the same for use as
a county building, we beg leave to
submit for your consideration the
following report:
Would Cost $22,000.
To erect a building at the present
time of similar construction would
cost about $22,000, although our es
timate on the present building is
$?,000 I understand the school
board has sold this building to the
county for $10,000 This price, I
think is very reasonable, as the
building, as it now stands, lays out
a very neat floor plan for court house
purposes. There are but very few
partitions that would have to be
changed, and only one that would
have to be added I also recommend
that the exterior of the building be
trimmed with colored cement on the
sills, and caps of the windows and
doors, and the exterior woodwork be
painted to harmonize with these dec
orations. In doing this, it would
change the entire appearance of the
building and make it an up-to-date
building and one that would be well
commended on.
Recommends New Roof.
The present roof leaks in a few
places, and needs repairing. I would
recommend that a new roof be put
on, as I am sure this would be more
satisfactory, and would not need at
tention for years to come.
The third floor of the building will
make very satisfactory rooms for jury
rooms and a sheriff room. The only
attention this floor needs is to plaster
the smoke flues The woodwork,
floors and steps are in good condi
tion.
Ideal Court Room.
The second floor lays out into a
court room 27'6x53'0, and has plenty
of light and ventilation and will make
an ideal court room In taking out
the partition between the coat rooms,
this makes a good room for the su-

(By United Press Correspondent)
Petrograd, Jan. 5.Watchful wait
ing, that well-known American policy
regarding Mexico some months ago,
sums up the war situation in Russia
today, but watchful waiting in Rus
sia has a meaning all its own.
Whereas Uncle Sam, after experi
encing a few pin-pricks in his pa
tience, remained passive, the great
Russian bear after sustaining a heal
thy, life-sized wallop on his tender
snout let out a roar that shook the
earth continents away. Reduced to
plain English the roar was:
Claims Enough Men.
"Give me munitions I've got
enough men."
That was several months ago. Rus
sia's greatest arsenal, near Petrograd,
had been blown to smithereens the
armies of Grand Duke Nicholas,
yielding to the Austro-German steam
roller, had been driven from the Car
pathians back into Russia and had
lost Warsaw and the whole of Po
land there was political dissension
in Russia alarming semi-revolu
tionary outbreaks were occurring
here and there the ever advancing
enemy was threatening even Moscow,
and the greatest seaport in the Baltic,
Riga, appeared to be about to fall.
In winter, bears usually hibernate,
but all these things and more which
happened to the Russian bear in the
summer and fall of 1915 precluded
any idea of his going into" winter
quarters this year. Russia is today
the most active winter bear extant.
Russia has now mobilized her in
dustries and shells and other muni
tions in great quantities have begun
to flow from the factories and shops

London, Jan. 5.When months

with 50,000,000 Americans through
the United Press, I plainly expressed
my belief of a long, long war. Events
have followed along the lines that I
indicated.
Each day brings success and
strength to us and weakens the
enemy.
The German viewpoint in the war
is frankly for money making and
territorial aggrandizement. Dr. Helf
ferich, German finance minister, has
constantly dwelled upon the indem
nities that Germany will obtain. He
said that his country had hopes to
obtain the Bedgian Congo and was
under the impression that the wealth
of Europe would fall into their lap
during the first few weeks of the
war. England's unexpected entrance
into the war probably was the stop
ping of this.
The common people of England,
Prance and other Allies are grateful
to the Americans. Over 10,000 Am

have become officers. One said to me
that he Was not fighting for the king
and the country but was fighting for

J. 0. Harris, Hotel Proprietor, Former
Register of Deeds, Secures
Privilege. _*li
OTHERS TO MAKE
APPLICATIONS
May Mean Test Case Will Attempt
to Nullify Treaty Federal Men
to Confiscate "Booze."
Despite the fact that the village
of Kelliher is in territory governed
by the Indian treaty of 1855, and
despite the fact that under the treaty
no liquor is permitted to be intro
duced, the council of that village has
granted a license to conduct a sa
loon in that village.
To J. 0. Harris.
The license was granted to J. O.
Harris, hotel proprietor at Kelliher
and formerly register of deeds of Bel
trami county. The license was
granted at a regular meeting of the
village council at which one mem
ber of the council, J. H. Hermanson,
was absent Trustee Lindquist voted
against the granting of the license.
First Broadside.
The granting of the license is the
firing of the first "broadside" against
the Indian "lid" by Kelliher men.
Two other men, R. J. Poupore and
Gust Olson, have made applications
for licenses and it is expected that
several others will also apply. Most
of the business men of Kelliher are
in favor of saloons and members of
the village council are opposed to the
Indian treaty.
No "Blind Pigs" Now.
The licenses were issued in defir
ance to the campaignnow being con
ducted by Sheriff Andrew" Johnson
and County Attorney Graham M. Tor
rance against "blind pigs." Now that
a license has been granted the saloon
keeper cannot be arrested for con
ducting a "blind pig."
Seven Arrested.
When the campaign was begun by
the county officials, seven Kelliher
men were arrested. They pleaded
guilty to having unlicensed drinking
places and were fined $50 each. Sev
eral weeks later several of thesf
same men and several others, seven
in all, were arrested. This time
only one pleaded guilty and the bal
ance asked for trials. The trials
which were to be heard in the muni
cipal court before Judge Crowell to
morrow have been postponed for two
weeks on account of the illness of
the judge. T. McCarthy, who was
one of the Kelliher men arrested for
selling liquor, this afternoon appear
ed before Judge Crowell at his home
and pleaded guilty. He claimed that
it was his first offense and that he
would not go into the business
again. He was fined $50. The
other men arrested and whose trials
will be taken up in two
vveeks are Andrew Stormoen, It. J.
Kramer, R. J. Poupore, William
Begsley, Harvey Johnson and J. O.
Harris.
Attorney A. A. Andrews of this
city is defending the Kelliher men.
Is First to License.
Kelliher is the first village to op
pose the Federal treaty by granting
a state license. It is stated that
some five points can be brought up
if the matter is made a test case,
which might effect the nullifying of
the provisoins of the Indian treaty
under which the saloons in this part
of the state are closed. Should it be
found that liquor licenses can be
granted many other villages and
cities in the "dry" zone, it is expect
ed, will take action.
Can Confiscate Liquor.
Government authorities, although
a license is granted, can confiscate
all liquor found, and in case of in
troduction can make arrests under a
Federal charge. The authorities do
not believe that the state will inter
fere with the Federal act. It is ex
pected that many Federal men will
be sent to Kelliher to confiscate li
quor and to make arrests under in
troduction charges.
Just what action will be taken by
the county in the matter was not
stated this morning by County At
torney Torrance.
First for Appeal.
It is believed that the action of
the Kelliher men is the first step for
an appeal to be made to congress to
abrogate the treaty. The treaty has
been referred to as "a federal blight
and an unjust act of the Indian bu-
