H0VI0US SURRENDERS TO OFFICIALS.
Last Saturday, about the noon hour,
Charles Taylor, who was-well-known Id
Columbia, having worked for Goff
Bros, and other people about town,
was at Knifley, Adair county. He had
some trouble with a negro man named
White, the latter leaving Taylor and
entering A. Hovious' store. Taylor
was drinking and as soon as the darky
entered the store, he followed and re
newed the trouble by cursing the ne
gro, making threats, etc. Mr. Ho
vious, who conducts the store, asked
him not to make trouble in his house.
This infuriated Taylor and he picked
up a weight, as though he was going
to throw it, but instead he laid it
down. He then stepped up to Hovious
and struck him in the mouth with his
fist. Hovious remarked, "Charley
you should not have struck me," walk
ing behind his counter as soon as he
had made tbe remark. Taylor con
tinued to use abusive language, and
remarked; "No d m man can put
me out of this store." At this junc
ture Hovious reached for his gun, a
single barrel shot gun, and fired at
Taylor. The contents entered his
right shoulder and left breast. He
lingered until 8 o'clock when he died,
physicians doing all they could for
him.
The 'above has been gathered from
an eye witness to the trouble.
Hovious came to Columbia
forenoon and surrendered to
thoritles, and will be given
amining tiial in a few days.

which caused the gun " to fire, the
whole load entering the boy'sNeft
shoulder and left breast His heart
was penetrated and he died instantly,
his father being a short distance from
him when the accident occurred. The

the deepest sorrow, and the parents of
the dead boy prostrated. The dead
boy was a grand son of Mr. F. P. Do
honey, and a great nephew of Mrs.

good water at his kitchen door, and
that hundred yard tramp to the spring1
will be forever a drudge of the past.

low when'the Columbia and Stanford
road is completed to. or beyond Mr.
Boyse's residence. The'starting of the
road has doubtless set him to work
for 'water its completion is full of
promise of other progressive steps.
