History or tnc new.
For several months there has been
a persistent rumor that the Kirst Na
tional bank, having outgrown its pres
ent quarters, was contemplating the
erection of u modern banking and of
fice building at a central location, hut
it was impossible to make anything
more out' of the rumor than mere
talk. Six or eight months ago Colonel
Sellers wpnt to work to secure options
on centrally located property which
might be available for such a build

his efforts came to naught. i

IRV MORNINO JOURNAL CPCCIAl LGA6C1 Wlftt
Washington, Jan. 4. There was no
j lessening of the tension In ihe new
submarine crisis today with I'resl-
Wilson's return to the White
House to take personal charge of the
situation, but. there were marked in
dications of the president's intention
to proceed carefully and deliberately
before committing the I'liilcd States
to the next step in ils already strain
ed relations.
To Vvwil Cautiously,
At the state department the hope
was expressed that there Would be
opportunity to Keltic the crisis arnica-
A bly and it was staled thnt the Ameri-
I'1"1, Kovernnient
nciieveu umi.
in the Ancona unto
iwere given in good faith. Two points,
jit w"h emphasized, must be cleared
up before the next move is made. It
must be established whether the
Itritish liner Persia actually was tor
pedoed, and, if so, what was the na
tionality of the submarine.
Tumulty Issue- Statement.
President Wilson's first act on his
return was to issue a statement
through Secretary Tumulty promising
the country action Just as soon iiM
tlie full fads in the Persia disaster
! can be learned.
S Secretary Lansing ordered the con
suls at Alexandria, Malta and Cairo
to obtain affidavits and at once cable
summaries of their contents',
Until that information in obtained
or until Ambassador Penfleld reports
some result from his Inquiries to the
Austrian government, the situation
wlil be at a standstill.
Next 8tC Considered.
Meanwhile, there Is discussion of
what steps the United States may
take to make clear to tho central
powers and their allies thn extent to
which it expects to hold them respon
sible for submarine operations in
violation of International law.
Austria's plea that she knew noth
ing official of the outcome of the
submarine controversy with lermany
is recalled by one set of officials, who
favor taking action which might fore
stall it similar idea by the other ni
nes when tho I'nltcd States has fin
ished with .Austria.
.Vote to oilier Teuton Allies.
It was disclosed today that the
United States already had delivered
to the American diplomatic represent
atives In Turkey and Dulgarln nnd to
i tho Turkish and Itulgarlan diplomats
here copies of the submarine corres
pondence with Germany.
The latest developments of the cri
sis for the first time 'brought the
president Into conference with the
heads of the congressional committee
on foreign relations and disclosed
that they are to be informed of the
coining steps.
Spcce'i-miiklng Prfiml.
Administration leaders were uneasy
today over the prospect of an oppo
sitlon attack In the senate on tho ad
ministration policy, I ut that fear was
relieved when tho senate, after being
in session ten minutes, adjourned Inn
respect to the memory of the late Jus
tlce Lamar, he house showed no un
easiness and the day passed over with
out speech-making which the admin
istration feared might further Inflame
the public mind.
At Most CrltU'al Stage.
The president and his advisers are
represented as realizing to Its full ex
tent that the submarine controversy,
drawn over nearly a year with per
plexing and critical negotiations often
brought to the breaking point, now is
at the most critical stage it ever has
assumed and their Intention Is that
tho next step shall place the govern
ment in a position where It will be
able to maintain the principles of in
ternational law and humanity,
rosslhly Not TorMili.
There is yet the possibility that the
