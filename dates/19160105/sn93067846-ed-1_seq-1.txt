was the meat perplexing presented to
Austria. Ofaeials haxe say Austria hss

The steamer aank so slowly that,
the submarine ooiamander at , first
doubted whether tha steamer oauld
sink. Only at 1:10 o'clock did It sink
bow first. During these further 45
minutes. It la averred, all tha per?
sons aboard could have easily been
saved with the available boats From
tho circumstances that thla did not
occur the commander concluded that
the craw eared themselves and toft
tha passengers.
Tha entire loaa of life, the note eat
forth, car. not be attributed In tha
first Instance to the sinking of the
?easel, but In some degree to the
dropping of the first boat while the
steamer was proceeding at full epeed
and to the fact that the crew only
thought of their awn safety and did
not reeoue the passengers from the
oapataad boats, though also to the
shells which hit the Seeing vessel.
But the death of the persons drown?
ed with tha sinking vaaaal must
above all, be ascribed to the "culpa?
ble behavior" of the crew.
The Austrian reply then states thr t
I the American note In several points
is baaed on incorrect suppositions and
describes as Incorrect that a shell
was at once fired, that tha sub?
marine went, in pursuit and overtook
the ateamer. that only a short time
was allowed for those aboard to enter
the boats an 1 that several shots were
fired on the steamer even after it hud
stopped.
"The com/nander of the sut>
marins," the note continues, "allow?
ed the ateamer more time than was
necessary for the passengers to take
to the boats and then torpedoed the
veaael in auch a manner that It
would remain afloat as long as pos?
sible to enable the passengers to dis?
embark, an object which would have
obtained if the passengers had not
been forsaken by the crew."
Fully appreciating the attitude of
the commander, who had in view
jtha rescue of the passengers and
crew, says the note, "tha Austro
Hungarian naval authorities have ar
rived at the conclusion that he ap?
parently neglected to take sufficiently
into consideration the panic among
the passengers which rendered dis?
embarkation more difficult and the
spirit of the regulations that Austro
Hungarian naval officers should re?
fuse assistance to no one in distress,
even an enemy. The officer was there?

NEGRO HELD FOR ASSAULT.
[Parents of OhUd Alleged to Have
Outraged Say Let Law Take Its
Course.
Tork, Jan. 1.?Odessa Good, a ne*
gro youth, 16 years old, la in the
county Jail hare charged with attempt?
ed criminal asaault upon a $-year-old
white girl, the daughter of a promi?
nent farmer living in Bethel town?
ship, about ten miles north of this
place.. The crime was committed on
tike premises of the girl's father Wed*
nesday afternoon, but waa not dis?
covered until Thursday. The negro
who Uvea on the same farm with his
{brother-in-law, was arrested Thursday
[afternoon by Constable Horace John
[son and brought to jail here.
The youth of the negro is said to
have saved him from being burned by
outraged citizens of the Bethel com
muniyt immediately after the
crime was discovered. The desire of
the little child's parents,to let the law
take its course prevented a lynching
anyway. No further trouble is expect?
ed, although there la much Indigna?
tion throughout this entire section
over the affair.
The child was given prompt medi?
cal attention as soon as her condition
was discovered, and attending phy?
sicians say she will recover entirely.
It is understood that the negro has
confessed his crime. He appeared sul?
len and mean when questioned by
your corresp^ ient, and appeared not
I to appreciate the serious position he
Iis In. He Is a grandson of Giles
Good, who with four negroes, Prind
ley Thomson, Bailey Dowdle, Dan
Roberts and Mose Lipscorab, were
lynched on the outskirts of this
town, April 5, 1887, for the murder of
a white boy in Bullock's Creek town?
ship.
'I am not expecting trouble over
this affair," said Sheriff Hugh G.
Brown this morning. "The parents of
i the outraged child have expressed
their wish that the law be allowed to
take its course, and I believe the good
citizens of York county Will respect
(that wish."
