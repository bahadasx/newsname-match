FIFTY-SECOND YEAR
lOUR
Government to Call
Austria to Account
UNITED STATES REPRE
SENTED AS BEING PRE
PARED AND DETERMIN
ED TO TAKE ANY ACTION
WARRANTED WHEN ALL
THE FACTS ARE KNOWN.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 The pres
itlent is en route to Washington to
personally assume charge of the na
lion's foreign affairs in the new crisis
resulting" from the sinking of the
Persia and the loss of at least one
American. The situation is regarded
as the most serious to confront the
United States since the Teutonic sub
marine operations began. The presi
dent will probably lay the available
facts before the cabinet tomorrow.
The destruction of the Persia, foi
lowing closely the Ancona crisis, may
result in the United States determin
ing to settle immediately all questions
involved in submarine warfare. It is
expected that the subject will be con
sidered tomorrow in the -house and
senate.
The United States is represented as
being prepared and determine J to
take any action warranted, when the
facts are established.
The Austrian embassy charge con
ferred with Secretary Lansing today,
and is said to have suggested the
withholding of judgment until the
facts arc known. He expressed the
belief that the final explanation would
be satisfactory.
No Warning Given.
LONDON, Jan. 3. The Peninsular
and Oriental Steamship Company re
ceived the following telegram from
Colonel C. C. Bigham. who was
among the survivors of the Persia
disaster:
"A torpedo struck the ship on her
port bow at 1:15 o'clock in the after
noon when about forty miles south of
the cast end of the Island of Crete.
No warning was given, nor any at-!
tempt made to assist. Within five!
minutes the ship had sunk.
"It was impossible to lower the
starboard boats, owing to the heavy
list. Five or six boats were lowered
on the port side. 1 didn't see this
myself, as I was washed overboard
when the boat capsized.
"The conduct of the passengers and
crew was splendid; there was no
struggling and no 'panic. Four boats,
after thirty hours at sea were picked
up by a warship."
Details of Sinking.
Details of the sinking of the Persia
come in slowly, but such informs-:
tion as is received makes it appear
that the number of persons who es
caped in the four boats which wert
put off was larger than was hoped
when tnc first news was received.
The Peninsular and Oriental Com
pany, which owned the Persia, an
nounced that 15S survivors had ar
rived at Alexandria.
The survivors comprise the chief
officer, second officer, seven engin
eers, 27 seamen, 63 lascars and 59
passengers.
A Lloyd's dispatch gives the num
ber at 153, made up of 59 passengers,
of whom 17 arc women, and 94 mem
bers of the crew, including 59 lascars.
The survivors include military of
ficers and eight persons who were not
British subjects.
"The ship was struck amidsiiip on
the port side at 1:10 p. m.." says Ren
ter's correspondent at Cairo. "She
had disappeared completely by 1:15.
"Survivors say it was little short of
a miracle that anyone was saved.
T .ere was no panic. Four boats were
laurc'icd with the utmost prompti

Near Breaking Point Is
WASHINGTON
will reassemble tomorrow
midst of an international situation
which rival political leaders admitted
tonight is one of the most critical
that has ever confronted the nation.
Returning members talked of little
but tne consequences which might re
sult from the sinking of the British
steamer Persia in the Mediterranean
with the loss of American life and
strained diplomatic relations between
the United States and Austria.
Although administration leaders arc
inclined to proceed cautiously and
await positive information, there is a
general feeling of uneasiness among
the senators and representatives over
the gravity of foreign affairs. Al
though rcign crshadow
everything else in interest for the mo
ment, activity over national prepared
ness will begin at once.
Act Is Denounced.
LONDON, Jan. 3. The London

With Austria
Belief of Congressman
Jan. 3 Congress! ormity, as far as America is concern
morrow in theicd, is yet full.
The Post says:
"We long ago relinquished all cx-
pectation that neutral nations would
effectually intervene in these repeated
outrages of international law. It is
naturally a matter for their own con
science, but at the same time it must
be said tltat their position is singu-
Iarly inconsistent with their pleading-
to the allied belligerents tuat they
may be
allowed to trade with
the
enemy."
The Post then severely reproaches
the British government for making
secret agreements to assist such
trading. '
The Times' editorial assuming that
it was the Austrians, though it may
possibly have been a German or a
Turkirdi submarine, says: I
"Whatever flag is stained by this I
fresh outrage, there is no room lot

PREPARING FOR COMBIN

POWERS ON THE ATLAN

FOR TEN YEARS.
Br Associated Press.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3. The pos
sibility of a combined attack by two
foreign powers to break down the new
Pan-American doctrine evolved from
the maintenance by the United States
and the acceptance by the South and
Central American republics of the
Monroe doctrine is one of the funda
mental bases of the national defense
plans being formulated by fhe army
and navy strategists.
It was learned that they believe it
essential to formulate a national mili
tary policy to provide against an
eventual assault upon the doctrine by
an Asiatic or by an European power
or by an alliance iff two'stich novVcrs",
which might hurl forces simultane
ously on the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. A navy in strength to equal
those of any two world powers, ex
cept England, and an army prepared
to uphold the Pan-American idea any
where in Pan-America is the ultimate
aim of the plans of the military ex
perts. The navy general board be
lieves that there will be ten years
time in which the United States will
have to prepare for the readjustment
of the world forces following the Eu
xopcan war. The plans of the army
war college will be consummate 1 in
six years. The navy plans recommend
an expenditure for 1916 of $317,000.-
000 for ships, against a total invest
ment of less than half a billion during
the last thirty years for navy fighting
equipment. The war college recom
mended an expenditure of $5C0,000,-
f!0 during 1916 and 19!7, to produce
mobile army which with the re
serves will total l,500,00i). There are
to be 500.000 regulars. The remainder
will be continental.
