T. P. Fenton's Sale.
After returning from the fun-
cral of his mother in Nebraska,
T. P. Fenton decided to soil his i
personal property here, rent his 1
farm and locate in northern Kan-
eas to assist his father and an .
uncle, neither of whom has any
one to keep house for him.
So ho has hilled a sole for
Wednesday, January 19, at his
farm adjoining Elgin on the
west, commencing at 10 .30 a m.,
with the following property lo be
old. Six head of horses and
mule", 33 head of cattle inclurl
ing one red Poll bull. 15 head of
h;gs including one Duros boar,
10 dozen full blood Barred Hock
pullets and some roosters, farm
n6hineryrhoufltholdgoods and
many other articles.
A credit will be given until Oct.
1, 1916, on sums over $10 and hit
discount for cash. The ladies
will serve lunch at noon. For
full particulars see the Jnrgo two
colored bills printed by the Fak
mers'Champion. Wheat Benefited.
While the light showers the
past week have made no impres
sion on the empty cisterns and
wells, they have been n great
benefit to the winter wheat. In
many places where the ground
looked bare before thev fell it is
now perfectly green. The warm
weather has aided great
ly in bringing this nbout, as it
has not been freezing any at
rlight.

At a sale in Oklahoma City last
week the publishers of the Daily
Oklahomnn bought the Oklaho
ma City Times and nre now pub

A correspondent asks if it pays
farmers to keep hens and milk
cows. 1 passed the question to
Mrs. W. B. Steedman who is a
live, progressive farmer's wife
living two miles southeast of
Hob, t. For reply, Mrs. Steed
man turned to her account book
showing the sales made in 1914,
and gave me the following:
For six cows and one hundred
hens, she sold eggs and butter
amounting to $690.50. Buttsr
used amounted to $79.00. This
made an income of $669.50, be
sides the value of eggs used by
the family and the skim milk

which wero bought in town when
young and fed milk until they
were old enough to thrive on an
