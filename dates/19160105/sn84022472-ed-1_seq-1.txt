About $5,000,000 worth of stocks of

the European -war began the Bridge

" papers filed in court show the profits
were so large that the company pros

; ;i The owners of the : pledged stock
recently attempted to obtain a share
of these profits by means of an action
brought by the New J ersey receiver

action against the New York receiver
to account, but Justice Whitfatker de
nied ,the ; petition. The plaintiff then
began ah action before Justice Ford
to "instruct the receiver in regard to

In these papers, filed in the county

JUROR'S LETTER
CAUSES ABRUPT
ENDING OF TRIAL
Suit Against Manufacturer
For $10,000 Must Be
Heard Aneyr. v
MISTRIAL DECLARED
AND COURT ADJOURNS
William H. Wessels of
Greenwich Unwittingly
Violated Juror's Oath.
The writing of a letter by a Juror to
a lawyer in the case resulted in Judge
Gager this morning declaring a mis
trial In the $10,000 action brought by
Benjamin ,Feinman, administrator,
against Casper D. Wallace of this city.
The Juror, William H. Wessel3 of
Greenwich, ; violated his oath in writ-,
ing the note and Judge Gager ruled
that there was nothing else to do but
discharge the Jury and order a new
trial.' As no other cases were ready
for trial it was necessary to adjourn
court until mext Tuesday.
On the jury which was chosen yes
terday to hear the evidence were for
mer Director of Public Works John H.
Colgan and Isaac P. Turney of this
city. Juror 'Wessels learned after the
trial was almost over that these two
men were Bridgeport residents. The
automobile aecldent, which was- the
cause of the present suit, happened in
this city and Wessels had an idea that
( Juror was disqualified from acting in
a case which concerned an affair in his
own city.
He therefore wrote a note to Judge
A.- B. v Beers, counsel for Wallace, in
which he stated that, although Judge
Beers might not be afarare of the fact,
there were two Bridgeporters on the
jury. . Wessels" said he thought Judge
Beers should know this. Judge Beers
was aware that Colgan and Turney
live in this city. The mere fact that
they are Bridgeporters would not dis
emality them from acting in a local
trial. '
Nevertheless Judge Beers felt it his
duty to inform Judge Gager that he
had received the note from Juror Wes
sels. The court remarked that the
Juror had made an . innocent mistake
by , writing: the ;note. He had un
wittingly violated his oathby talking
about the case with a person outside
the Jury during the progress of the
trial, .. Julge. Gager was not disposed
to censure Jurolr Wessels but said Tie-

Widow Appeals When
Court Denies Share
In ilusband's Estate
Claiming that she received-no no
tice of her husband's death or of the
probating of his estate, and therefore
was denied her rightful share, Mae
Butler, of Minneapolis, Minn., filed a
petition In the probate court for a
redistribution of the estate. Judge
Miller today denied the petition on
the ground that every ; legal require
ment had been compiled with and the
only heir at law to make claim for the
estate was Luch Washington, mother
of Mr, Butler. She lives at Roxbury,
Conn. - '
AH the parties In interest are col
ored people and Mrs. Butler was rep
resented - by a colored lawyer, George
Branford, of New Haven. Mrs. Butler,
who was Mae J. Seames, presented
evidence that she was married to
Butler in Minneapolis on Dec. 15,
1909. He afterward left her and
came to Bridgeport, where he, died In
1913. Whether the couple saw each
other or communicated with each oth
er from the time Butler left until is
death does hot appear In the papers
at the probate court.
Henry E. Bishop was the adminis
trator of the estate which consisted
of $500 equity in a piece of real es
tate and $508.63 in cash in banks.,
After Mr. Butler's bills, the cost of
settlement of the estate, funeral ex
penses, etc., had been paid, there was
left $154.61, which his mother inher
ited as sole heir at law.
Since she received the money nearly
two years ago and after every leeral
requirement had been complied with,
Judge Miller denied the petition. At
torney Branford served notice at once
of ' Intention to appeal.
CHOATE ASSERTS
RAILROAD TRIAL
HAS BEEN UNFAIR
Counsel For Directors of
New Haven Declares New
England Repudiates Case
WOULD PROTECT NAME
OF OUR GOVERNORS
Says Government didn't
Dare Try Case in Any of
New England States.
New York, Jan. ' 5. Charles F.
Choate, of Boston, told the jury today
while summing up the case for the de
fense at . the trial of the 11 former di
rectors of the New Haven road on
charges of violating the Sherman law,
that the people of Nev England , were
opposed to the prosecution and had re
pudiated it. , ' '
"New England repudiates this pros
ecution," he asserted. "They will have
none of it. The government put these
men on trial where they were not
known. Tu probably heard of none
of them before they were brought into
this , court. The government did not
dare' to try them in the courts of New
England.
' "And I say that the men . who would
dare 'to insinuate in New England, as
has ' been done here, against the fair
name of Governor Draper well, I
daren't tell you what would happen to
him. And the man who would, say
that Robert Winsor is n'ot an honest
man would receive the contempt he
justly deserves. , ,
Mr. . Cnoate said that the govern
ment, with all its experts and its se
cret service had not been able "to
produce one witness from New Eng
land who would testify to a single act
of oppression on the part of the New,
Haven." '-.
The lawyer dwelt at length upon the
improvements in service which the
New Haven had furnished to New
England, citing in particular the ter
minals at Boston. .
Speaking of the New Haven's fights
with,-.rival steamboat lines, Mr. Choate
asked: . ,
"Are you to sit defenseless and let
others tsfke your property from you?
."What is the logical outcome of
competition ? There is a weaker and
a stronger. And the govFnment says
If you- fight your competitor till he
succumbs then you are violating the
law. And if you give him chance to
live and Work along with him then
you are also violating he law."
WON'T ALLOW
PERSONALITIES
IN BIG DEBATE
Suffragists and, "Antis"
Must Be Ladies When
They battle (Tonight
Special precautions have been tak
en to keep the big suffrage battle
scheduled for tonight within . the
bounds of logical argument. The com
mittee in charge of the affair have
issued Instructions to Referee Ernest
Berger, appointed by the Bridgeport
Philosophical society, that in the open
debate only, written questions may be
proposed to the chairman." This meth
od has been taken in order to assure
that personalities and irrelevancies
may be avoided in the heated argu
ments between suffragists and "an
tis." Another feature of the affair which
is open to all women interested in
either cause is a newly formed wom
en's orchestra. Under the leadership
of Mrs. John J. Llndholm, Mrs. Cora
Van Yorx, Miss Carrie Whitney, Miss
Elizabeth Spelcer and Miss Margaret
Casey will combine to offer orches
tral selections. Miss Vida Stearns
will be heard .in vocal solos. i
Another novel feature that has been
ordered is the taking of secret ballots
both before and after the debate to
see what effect the 'speaking has up
on the audience present and wheth
er, suffrage or anti-suffrage gains-'by
the argument.
The affair will be held in Knights
of Pythias hall, 102 5. Main, street the
atfirmative forces arguing "Woman's
Suffrage is Desirable" will be led by
Mrs.. Katherine Houghton Hepburn,
chairman of the Connecticut Worn
ens' Suffrage association, of Hart
ford. The negative will be led by
Mrs. Grace Duffiels Goodwin, of the
Anti-Suffrage association, Hartford.
Noble Estate Heirs

Henrietta M. Noble and Fanny S.
Dupuy, heirs of the John F. Noble es
tate on the north side .of Stratford

their intention to sue for greater land
damages in connection with the wid
ening of Stratford avenue. The Noble
estate heirs claim that their property
will be damaged to the extent of
$16,000. They reside in Jenkinstown,
Pa. They were awarded $317 in dam
ages for the property, which it is pro
posed to take from them in widening
the street for the approach to the pro
posed,, new Stratford avenue bridge.
Attorney Samuel C.Shaw appeared at
a hearing before the common council
a short time ago and said that his
clients will claim large land damages
if their property is disturbed. The

An unknowns manj. evidently a pros

wound in the roof of his mouth. From
the position of the body It would ap
pear the man committed suicide. Be
side the body .was .a 32-calibre five-

empty. " ....... .
The body was found at 1:10 "this
afternoon by John Magra of 118 Pine
street, who was ' crossing the -- lot.
From ' the appearance ' of the corpse
it is believed that the man had been
dead only a short time.
Young Magra at once notified Ser
geant Sanger at the Third precinct
station. Sergeant O'Oonnell and a po
liceman went to the scene and the
body was taken to, Cullinan & Mullins"
morgue. , The man Was well built, of
about five feet five inches in height
and , weighed in the neighborhood .of
155 pounds. He had darK Drown nair
and mustache.
He wore a brown -mixed cap, light
brown trousers and -a- black overcoat
over . a dark coat, new red sweater
and starched stiff shirt with collar
and a black necktie. He wore black
congress gaiters.
From the condition of the man s
hands and his body it Is believed he
had. formerly been engaged in some
kind of clerical employment. No
money was found on his person.
Medical Examiner Garlick took
charge 'of the revolver and some let
ters written In Hungarian, which were

dener, has brought a suit for" $809
damages against the Brqtherhood Ac
cident Insurance Co. of Boston. The
suit has been returned to the superior
court In this city. Johnson had a pol
icy with the company. It is the con
tention that Johnson was told to cart
away some bombs which were on the
Bulkeley premises at Fenwick but ha
voluntarily lit the fuse of one of them
and that it exploded and blew off
part of the chin, producing a fatal
wound. -The company takes theJ
ground that Johnson voluntarily j ex

company is therefore not liable.

The total' number of men ready to j
bear arms obtained from enlistments
for the period between October 23 and.
(Dec. 15 is -estimated .in- Lord- Derby's t
report at 1,046,493. - After deductions
from the total number of attested men j
of the various classes indispensable fori i
civil occupations, the numbers - avails j
able for military service - are' 343,383 ;
single men and 487,765. married. :
Adding those who enlisted for Jm- ;
mediate service gives a total ready to
bear arms of 446,386 single and 600,107: ',

"An obstacle -to recruiting," says the
report, '"has been the unequal treat-
lent o Individuals. Parents and re-! ,
lations, especially, cannot understand '
why their sons, husbands or brothers
should Join while ' other young men :
hold back and secure lucrative, em- ',
ployment at home. ' Apart from the j
number of men who have, actually en
listed and attested there are many )

and so" has also promised to go.' ;

pledge was made. There is an abund- '

afraid that on analysis do not prove '
as satisfactory as I could have wished.
Owing to the great rush of recruits it
was impossible in many cases to have '
more than the most perfunctory med- j
leal examination, and the number of '
men who will be rejected when the
various groups are called up and sub- ;
Jected to proper examination must be i
very large; the number of men ac
tually examined both starred and un-
tsarred, being 925,455."
The Earl points out also that many ;
must be reduced as the sole support of j
dependent . relatives. He says there i
are 651,160 unstarred single men un
accounted for.
"This is far from being' a pegligibla
