The National Ski Tournament at
Glenwood, Minnesota, Feb. 4th,
and 5th, 1916.
The National Ski Tournament of
America will be held at Glenwood1,
Minn., Feb. 4th and 5th, 1916. The
local ski club is doing all in its power
to make this one of the best tourna
ments ever held since the organiza
tion of the National Ski Association.
Glenwood has one of the finest ski
hills in America. The last four inter
state tournaments which the Glen
wood club has given have been pro
nounced by the skiers and spectators
as among the most successful on the
circuit. This year the club is natur
ally straining every effort to make it
only the best tournament ever
held in Glenwood, but also the great
est and best National Tournament
ever held in America.
Last Monday evening the Glenwood
Ski Club, at its meeting1 in the Com
mercial Club Rooms, appointed' com
mittees to take charge of the various
departments and discussed various
things in connection with the holding
of the National Tournament. Ar
rangements are already under way
for special train service on all roads
running into Glenwood. An enter
tainment and lodging committee will
have charge of the handling of the
big crowd wh*ch is sure to come here
on Feb. 4 and 5. This* committee has
had considerable experience in hand
ling the large crowds of former in
terstate tournaments and will this
year be in a position to care for a
crowd three or four times' as large as
the usual annual tournament crowd.
The first day of the National Tour
nament Feb. 4th, will be taken up
with the Amateur skiers and also a
cross country run of several miles,
this course to be laid out over hills,
timber, across fences and with
a home stretch on the lake. This
cross country run will be one of the
most interesting features of the Na
tional meet and many skiers are al
ready training for this most difficult
contest.
The boys' contest will also be held
on the first day of the tournament,

Fatal Accident.
One of the saddest accidents of the
history of this city occurred Sunday
morning when Leonard C. Simonson
lost his life. He went to Morris Sat
urday afternoon and expected to re-one
turn on No. 10. Apparently he miss
ed that train and got on No. 2. No.
2 is a through train but occasionally
stops here. While the facts are notprizes
known, the supposition is that the
train did not stop this time and that
the young man attempted to. jump off
the train was going at a high
rate of speed. He was caught in some
way and dragged from here to the
stock yards at Murdock, parts1 of his
body being scattered along the entire
distance. He was only recognizable
from papers in his pockets and shreds
of his clothing. The remains were
brought to Benson and will probably
be interred tomorrow.—Swift County
