Two Old-Line Parties in Hawaii
Soon to Name Delegates to
National Conventions
REPUBLICANS LIKELY TO
NAME SIX AND CONTEST
Believe Fight Before National
Committee Will win; Demo

Six delegates are virtually sure to
he named by Republicans of Hawaii
to go to the national convention in
Chicago next June. National Com
ruitteeman Charles A. Rice's sugges
t if that the O. O. P. here should
name its allotted two and four others
besides trusting to a contest before
the national committee, to seat the
fmir, meets with approval of leading
Republicans who read the suggestion
In yesterday's Star-Bulletin, following
' Rice's return from the mainland.
Hawaii is entitled to its customary
ixr the Republicans feel, and the sen
timent on the national committee Is
said to be strong for a restoration of
the old order.
Soma of the men who are under
stood to be willing to go as Hawaii's
delegates are National Committeeman
Rice, Iorrin Andrews, chairman of the
Republican territorial central commit
tee; Vice-Chalrman Robert W. Breck
ons. Delegate Kuhlo, H. L. Holsteln of
Hawaii, former national -committeeman,
and Senator A.: L. Castle of
Oabu. "v
In order to give the outside Islands
representation, the Republican custom
is tb name three delegates from this
Island and one each from Hawaii.
Maui and Kauai. On tho list above,
Maui Is not represented and It is en
tirely ' probable that either Senator
Harry Baldwin or Frank Baldwin will
be looked on wllh favor as a possible
delegate.
The return of Rice and Andrews
yesterday has rtirred tmthiags )olUl-.
.cal.Ticlilirought'back'a trunkful of
v mainland rolltical gossip and forecast
From now on both the Republican and
Democratic parties in Hawaii will be
getting ready to send their delegates
. to the big national conventions.
Say Old Fight Is Dead.
Y The forecast n the Republican par
ty is for a harmonious contest for the
six places. The old Kuhlo-Frear fight
i which disrupted the party four years
i ago will not be revived, it Is declared
by men who supported Kuhlo then
and since and worked for his success
in the last election 'for delegate t
Congress. Furthermore, they say that
f Rice's opposition to Kuhio for the
nomination in 1913 will not now mili
tate against Rice's going as a delegate
to the convention.
'"We want entire harmony and no
effort will be made to stir up past Is
; sues and use them against candidates
' for delegates now," said a leading Re
pjMcai this morning.
The Republican delegates will be
chosen this year In practically the
same way-as heretofore, the party
mles still retaining the territorial con
vention. This convention must meet
at least 60 days prior to the national
convention, hence It must be held at
least by April 7. So before long the
Republican cohorts will be humming
; with the preparations for the contest.
Since the direct primary law went
Jnto effect in the territory governing
the elections to office, conventions are
few indeed.
There will be activity soon in the
Democratic camp for delegates to the
national convention are to be chosen
by the direct primary method. This
is fully provided for in the revised
party rules, effective at the beginning
'of 1916. The representation is thus
Apportioned: Honolulu gets three
delegates, Hawaii one, Maui one and
Kauai one; To carry out the primary
' ilan, aspiratns for delegate must file

ONE POINT FOR DEFENSE
Nearly half a score of reasons why
the indictment returned against Miss

tained in a demurrer which has been
filed in circuit court by the defend-

The orosecution announced today

It is alleged in the demurrer that
the Indictment against Miss Spring

sufficient to constitute a crime under
the laws of the territory, in that it
does not charge any guilty Intent on
the part of the defendants in doing or
not doing the acts alleged by the in-

The demurrer further alleges that
section 4102 of the revised laws of
Hawaii under the provisions of which
the defendants, were indicted, and
which . they are alleged to have vio

the reason that "it requires a, person
to be a witness against herself or ,
himself "in a criminal case in con-
travention with the provisions of arti-1
cle five of the amendments pf the con

Associated Press Service by Federal Wireless
Y LONDON, Englaml, Jan. . 5. Compulsory military service to .
brinp more British subjects to the colors is now before the country,
; Vernier Asquith toilay introlueel in rarliament a bill provulinjr'
for ' a compulsory service which primarily will foree to join the amiy
bachelors and widowers with no '.lepemlent chiMren. -.'.-Though it is
inot generally inclusive, still the bill is of such a nature thai the most
radical opponents of conscription in any form ma.v contest the bilT
vigorously in rarliament. Y
. Under the terms of the measure introtluced by the premier, all
males between 18 and 41 are liable for inunediate call to the eolora
and must, respond' under penalty. Hachelors and widowers without
children are particularly liable to be impressed into service.
Jn introducing the jiieasurey the premier made an address which,
it is hopedY will pacify the extreme anti-conscription membtrs. Ue.
paid that no ease is made out for general compulsion ami that the"'
measure does not provide for universal impressment, hence it is
supportable by those who oppose conscription. Y
. Simultaneously -with the introduction of the bill there wa.s madd ;"
public a report from Lord Derby, in charge q recruiting, which ex.
plains why the cabinet has found it necessary to bring the measure
lor compulsory enlistment of the unmarried. Under the Derby plan
more than two and one-haf mjllions of men in England, Seotlaiiir
and Wales have enrolled, but after those engaged in indispensable
industries and those unfit for military service had been discarded,
there were left but 1,100,000 available. j Y-. :'.''
Of the unmarried only 650,000 failed to answer. The govern-
ftient will now attempt to redeem the pledge made by Premier
