Tho American Commission plana its

The United States's Wireless
Picks Up Thessaloniki
Far Off Course.
TO REACH HER TO-NIGHT
New Alarm for Rescue Ship
Patris, Which Was Due
Here To-Day,
Latrwt wireless advlcos thin after
noon from tho Scandlnavlan-Amorl-can
liner United States indicate that
the Greek liner Thessaloniki was still
afloat at 1 o'clock this afternoon nnd
that the United States may reach her
preeont position by 7 o'clock to-night.
Tho location given by the Thessa
loniki at 1 o'clock shows that the
hoavy northwest galo has driven hex
far to tho southeast of her last known
position.
Tho wireless recetvod at Uie Scandinavian-American
Lino Otllco from
Capt. Goctsche of the United States
reads:
"At 1 P. M. got tho Thessalon
Ikl'n observed position, 38.2S N.

east of sixth position Our posi

The "sixth position" referred to in
the message evidently means the last
position received by the United States
prior to the one quoted above. The
Kinking Greek liner tins sent out n
dlfferont position every feu- hours
since the United Slates began hunt
ing for her.
Tho whereabouts of tho ninety
members of hor crew left aboard
when the Patris of thn Greek Line
came to her rescue Is still unknown.
The location of tho Patris la also un
determined. The -offices of the National Steam
Navigation Company of Greece, Ltd.,
at No. 20 Pearl Street, agents for the
Tnensalonlkl und the Patris, were
crowded to-day with friends and rel
atives of passengers aboard tho two
hips, anxiously asking for nevta
Finally, about 11 o'clock. Nicholas
Galanos, manager of tho Greek Lino
office, gave out tho following wireless
which he said ho had Just received
from the Patris:
"Thessaloniki leaks. Crew want
to abandon her. Wo und SS.
United States uro vainly search-
lug. Cannot Und her.
"(Signed) "PATIUH."
This) information did not dispel
alarm, because the location of the
Patris was not given.
The coast guard cutter Mohawk,
somewhere off tho Jersey coast, has
been ordered to proceed to thn Thes
saloniki and will bo followed from
here to-morrow morning by tho Sen
oca as soon as tho latter is co,lc-d mi l
provisioned.
