Teachers in the District Public
Schools who marry can retain then
positions, Justice Gould, of the Dis
trict Supreme Court, decided today
In an opinion requiring the Board
of Education to reinstate Mrs.
Gladys Aline Strong Hgllmann.
The court held that Rule 45,
which provides that a female
teacher automatically vacates her
position of teacher when she mar
ries "is 'unreasonable and in con
flict with the provisions of the
organic act regulating the District
school system."

., ' By S. M. REYNOLDS,
i It is in (he direction of electric-lighting rates for residences rather ,
that) the cooking rates that the Potomac -Electric Power Company
could confer real benefits on the people of Washington,
As shown in the preceding article in this scries the first one df
which was printed in The Times on Monday .the new rates for cook
ing "offered'' by the company and approved by the Public Utilities
Coirmission amount practically to nothing as for as tho householder is
concerned. There are 25,000 consumers in Washington who are on
the company's books for electric lighting service, and when the new
rates were proposed only seventy-five consumers, according to officials
of the company, were in position to be benefited by them.
But about the electric light rates for residences the company is
saying nothing.
RATES IN PRIVATE RESIDENCES.
The company's rates for electric
tng service In private residences, as set
forth In Its folders under the caption,

follows:
"For the current conramed dur

The only .educators worthy of tne

Nelson, are the kindergarten teacher
anft the teachers of drawing, manual,
and physical training. The teachers
simply preside over an activity and let
nature do the rest. Up to the present
time the school authorities have oeen
busy organising knowledge, ana not
education.
The address of Dr. Nelson came as an
aftermath to the mass of scientific docu

LONDON. Jan. 5. When months aro I had the

In their retreat, the Austrlans blew

The bridgeheads on the south side of

The Bucharest dispatch Is undated and

that the Austrlans were moving re-enforcements

It Is stated that the Russian successes

Facts Wanted on Which to Base
Action Toward Austria AH
Germanic Allies May Got
Ultimatum.
President Wilson and Secretary
of State Lansing at an hour's con
ference today reached definite
conclusions as to the course the
Government will take in bringing
the entire submarine question to
a "show-down."
It was made plain after the con
ference that the Government is.
ready to act. The President only
awaits official news from Ambas
sador Penficld to determine his
attitude toward Austria.
On one point the Administration
has firmly made up its mind: The
Persia was sunk by a torpedo and
alt present indications lay the re
sponsibility jo Austria A ,
What the President and Secre
tary Lansing now desire is facts
to give a basis of action.
FACTS COMING.
These facts are expectcd'to come frem
Ambassador Penfleld and from the
American consular representatives at
Alexandria. Malta, and Cairo.
A day or two will be allowed for
these facts to reach Washington. If the
facts are not at hand at that time there
were strong InUmatlons today that the
Admlnlsratlon will move definitely to
demand reparation for the death of
American Consul McNecly on the Persia
and to demand pledges from the Ger
manic allies that will either bring an
end to Illegal submarine warfare or an
end to friendly relations between the
United States and the central powers
Although Secretary Lansing refused to
discuss the submarine question from anv
angle after his conference with the
President, it is denitely known that all
contingencies that may arise in the
Persia case were discussed and action
planned along any course that may 'be
demanded by the circumstances.
The strong probability that Austria
In reply to Ambassador Penlleld's In
quiry will refuse to ndmlt responsi
bility for the Persia attack was, dis
cussed by the President and Secretary
Lansing today and action to meet tnat
eventuality was decided upon
Will Cover Whole Question.
It Is definitely known that the action
the United States will take in the new
submarine question brought on by the
Persia sinking will be broad cnougn
to cover the entire submarine ques
tion. The United Btates not only will de
mand reparation for tho deaths on the
Ancona and Persia, but will Insist on
a definite understanding with Germany.
Austria, and their allies, to determine
the value of the disavowals, protesta
tions, and pledgos they havo made.
It is the firm conviction of orticiaia
that the submarine question must be
settled now, once and for alb and that
an end must be brought to the re
peated submarine assaults in defiance
of pledges of the central powers.
Whether there will be a break In rela
tions depends upon the httltude tne
Germanic allies may assume.
Gerard Acts.'
Press dispatches from Berlin state
that Ambassador Gerard has asked tn
foreign office, In behalf of his govern
ment, to lnrorm htm of the nationality
of the submarine which sank tnt
Persia.
They also report that Grand Admiral
von TIrpltx conferred with the Kaiser
presumably over the latest submarine
"victory. '
The only dispatch received by tne
Stato Department during the night was
from United States Consul Gauiin, at
Marseilles, France. Tho dispatch said;
"Marseilles agents of the Pentnsuis,
line state that only two American
were aboard the Persia: McNeelex.
missing; Grant, saved."
This disposes of the fear that Kd
ward Rose, of Denver, who boardea
tho boat at London, was a passenger
when tho Pershr Bank.
Significant statements credited to
German and Austrian diplomats that
the Persia was not entitled to im
munity from sumarlne attack be

ficials today that Austria will raise
this Issue In an effort to evade re
sponsibility for the latest sea disaster,
If Austria raises this defense it Was
emphatically stated by officials todav
the United States will reject it, and
hold Austria to full responsibility on
the basts ot the last Ancona notes.
The fact that the question or arraa
ment has not arisen In any or the pre

this point to the front as one that must
be settled.
