Double Murder and Shooting
of Policeman Among Mat
ters Discussed.
Although the board of safety held
a special me ting and wa.s in ses
sion for two hours Wednesday morn
ing, the only report given out at the
close of the conference was the ap
pointment of one new patrolman,
james F. i:eed, UMT N. Klmer st.
Chief of Police Kerr was called into
the conference and it was city hall
talk that the safety hoard was at
tempting to devise better plans for
.stopping the burglary epidemic in
South Rend and for capturing the
slayers of Henry Muessel and Frank
Chrobot, and apprehending the gun
man who .shot ami wounded Patrol
man Kugene Rogers, all of whom
are still at lare.
Clerk Harry Josephson stated that
the appointment of the patrolman
and the discussion of the filling of
other vacancies was the only husi
ness conducted by the board of safe
ty. Whether Chief Kerr was given
new orders relative to the search for
the criminals could not be learned,
although there was a well defined
report that the board was intending
to suppjy additional aid in the at
tempt to run down the bandits and
gunman.
Notliin? New, Says Chief.
Chief Kerr reported at H o'clock
that there was nothing "new" on
the search for the murderers of
Muessel and Chrobot or the Rogers
case, although it is known that one
I or more men were picked up hy the
; police and taken to the station dur
j ing the morning. A west side char
! acter was taken to the station Wed

I Kuespert brought John obkowiak

Tut Men Are Held. I
Chief Kerr said this afternoon
that John Sobkowiak and George
Schmidt are still held as suspects.
! Sobkowiak was arrested in Toledo in
i
I connection with the brewery murd. r
i mystery, while Schmidt was taken at
Lakeville Tuesday night as the man
who shot Patrolman Rogers. Kerr j
, stated that there wa.s no direct evi- j
dence against either of the men and I
that Schmidt would probably be rv !
leased shortly. He was to bt- brought
t headquarters for further question- ;
ing during the afternoon.
Thus far the police have been'
.unable to break down the story of!

Ireland is Excluded From

in Earnest.
Irtermt'etml Neun Service:
LONDON, Jan. 5. Premier
quith introduced the military
A p-ser-
ice hill providing for modified con
scription in the hou.e of commons
this afternoon. Ireland is excluded
from the workings of the measure.
Xo sooner had the premier quit
speaking than a fight was opened
up on the bill hy Sir John .Simon,
former secretary of state for home
affairs, who declared that it should
be rejected.
The age limits prescribed in the
bill are IS and 41. The measure
applies to bachelors and widowers
without any children dependent
upon them.
In referring to the recruiting fig
ures up to date, the premier eald
they were very encouraging anJ
would "convince England's allies
and Rngland's enemies that tho
people arc putting their hearts in
this war and are prepared to make
any sacrifice."
The hill, it was said, would have
the full support of those who op
posed general conscription.
This was a historic day In the life
cf parliament, and the Intense na
tional interest was reflected in the
great crowds which sought admis
sion to the spectators' galleries be
fore the hour of convening.
Kven with its Modifications the
hill has many enemies who have
promised a strong struggle against it
in parliament.
Readers of the labor party and
the Irish nationalists held confer
ences before parliament convened,
but so far a.s known no definite pro
gram of concerted action was agreed
upon.
The cabinet split caused by the
military policy of the Aequith gov
ernment has not been healed and It
was reported that the resignation of
Home Sec'y Sir John imon would
be followed by others. The possi
bility existed that announcement of
fuither resignations from the min
istry might be made in commons by
the premier.
The chief opponents to conscrip
tion left in the cabinet 'by the with
drawal of ir Jehn Simon were
Walter Runciman. president of the
board of trade, and Reginald Me
Henn;, chancellor of the exchequer.
One of th chief questions which
was still unsolved, when parliament
convened was whether or not Ire
land would be excluded from the
workings of the military service bill.
It was generally agreed that men
engaged in indispensable trades
would be eliminated.

mitted to the senate today by the
democratic majority of the import-
I r t committee appointed last session
to investigate chartres against the
motives of Pres't Wilson, Sec'y of
the Treasury McAdoo. and other ad
ministration olficials in their ad
ocacy of the ship purchase bill.
The ex-president's magazine articles
impugning the purposes of Pres't
Wilson were declared utterly base
less. Sen. Roies Penrose and Sen. Suth
erland of Utah, the republican minor
ity members of the committee, both
declined to Join in the majority's
criticism of the colonel. In deliver
ing the minority report, Sen. Suther
land said that he and Sen. Penrose
concurred in the majority's general
conclusion that the charges which
gave rise to the creation of the com
mittee were groundless, but said the
report went beyond the scope of the
inquiry and resembled a "campaign
document."
The committee told of Roosevelt's
statement in a magazine that Pres't
Wilson and former Sec'y of State
Bryan had "endeavored in the in
terest of certain foreign business
firms, to secure for the United States
the power to purchase the interned
ships of one of the belligerents," and
of his answer to a request from the
committee to appear as a witness, in
which he described the statement as
"literally true."
Was "Literally True."
"It is a. repetition of the offense
o say that the statement quoted
as 'literally true,' inasmuch as for
ign llrms would get the money that
was paid," the committee reported.
"The language used clearly imputed
to the officers referred to a desire to
see the legislation enacted not be
cause the public good was to be sub
served, but because some private
interests were to prolit by it. If the
writer had no intention to convey
such an impression, it is because he
is unfamiliar with the idiom of the
language he employed. He has
never heretofore been accused of
deficiency in that respect.
"The writer, whose eminence is
naturally calculated to give weight
to his utterances, finding himself
without any basis even of a hearsay
character, for hLs slanderous attack
upon the highest officer of his gov
ernment, simply resorted to a pal
pable sophistry to escape responsi
bility for the accusation he made."
Closely Interwoven.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 5. Anxious
waiting marked the administration's
attitude today toward the interna

Penfield reports, the reply of the
Austrian government as to whether
an Austrian submarine sank the Per
sia the hands of this government are
tied.
Meanwhile Pres't Wilson and his
advisers are closely studying tne
broader phase of the situation, that
dealing with the entire problem of
submarine warfare. The president
has promised action. His confidants
declare that his decision will be sat
isfying. They say that only a com-
Doctrine Cannot Apply.
There is no doubt that if the
United States addresses any new
communications to the Teutonic bel
ligerents, dealing with the submarine
question, that the reply will be. that
while they subscribe unqucstloningly
to the doctrine that merchant vessels
are entitled to the right of stoppage,
visitation and search, and to have
all passengers and crew safeguarded
before the vessel can be sunk, this
dfvetrine cannot apply to an armed
merchantman.
The Teutonic powers will hold,
their diplomatic representatives here
say, that with the German navy iso
lated the only purpose for which a
gun could be carried by a merchant
! vessel f the allies would be to re
sist submarine attacks. Thee guns
have a penetrating power through
two inches of steel at a distance of
20,000 yards, permitting them to
maneuver and sink a submnrne long
before it possibly could get with:n
torpedo ra litre.
AH shiK. Were Armed.
It is admitted that this is one of
the questions that the president and
Sec'y Lansing are considering. Every
vessel sunk in the Mediterranean
Fince the Ancona, has been armed,
according to the contention of the
German and Austrian embassies
here. And. while the United States
will stand by its original determina
tion that merchant vecis could
carry m:ns for defense in all cacs
up to the present time, there Is little
doubt that a new ruling on the sub
ject will be made which will rob
vessels so armed of any immunity
.secured in any n-w agreement that
may be reached.
Ambassador pentieM likely will
report to Wahln-Um not later
tha n
tomorrow, the result of his in'rdr-
if'S as to the nationality of the sb-
on to reply in good faith to the in
quiry and if she says that r.or.e ,,f
her under-sea craft was in the vicin-
uy or tne trage.i tmn sxateruent ..Li
be accepted. If she ass'irrey respr.n-
Isibility. it is IreheverJ here, that an
j explanation of the circumstances of
the sinking will be communicated at
the time responsibility is aeeepted.
