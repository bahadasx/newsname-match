Teutonic Nation Is Almost Self Supporting; German Sys

KftLIX. Jan. 5. One o the fore
most commercial and financial
experts of Germany says in the
"Vossische Zeitung" that by the devel
opment of the resources of Turkey, the
German nation will be entirely inde
pendent of the United States and will
also bring untold wealth to the Ger
man empire.
The pert is convinced that Syria
and Mesopotamia can be turned into
a granary for the central powers with
comparatively little expense. The
Ottoman empire Is three times as
large as Germany, but only has 21,
040.090 inhabitants. This compara
tively small population can never use
up what the fertile soil is able to pro-
duce. With the necessary capital and
the Introduction of agricultural machin-
ery, Turkey can raise grain enough to
supply many other countries besides
Germany and Austria.
England Cnnt Starve Germany.
Armenia and other parts of Asia
Minor contain unlimited quantities of
mineral and ores, especially copper and
iron. Large districts can easily be
used for the production of more cotton
than Germany and her allies need, and
Arabia will furnish thousands of tons
of the best coffee.
England will, therefore, never be
able to starve Germany, says the ex
pert, even if she keeps absolute con
trol of the seas. In the future any
blockade of -the entral Powers will be
useless, provided that they, emerge
victoriously from the present tremen
dous conflict.
