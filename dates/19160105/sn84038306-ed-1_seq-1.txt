ins* between this point and the city
tit Dubuque. All supplies and food
stuffs had to be hauled by team from
Dubuque, over the poorest kinds of
roads, and amidst the greatest dan

and business life of Manege55ter. Dur
ing those years, he saw this place
grow
from a. liarren wilderness to
one of the richest agricultural sec

about this transformation he had an
important part. He was keenly inter

interest in the ,work of Jones Mill

truly lived the principles of the or
der in his daily life.-. For many
years he filled tire office of treas

Here one day Mr. Norton was
shown the diary of a German sol

French soldier, who also buried the
fallen German, and sent the diary
which he took from the poor fel

As I write, the diary together with

It will be a long time before I shall

murder one cannot forget. On. Sat

trench, .quite near the Captain. His
servant was killed at once the shell

others were scarcely recognizable

I would write more, but we lie here
on the bodies of our comrades. That
agitates me always very much. On
the Yser Canal the bodies of the
dead—German and 'Belgian— lie in
heaps I have had to go by them al
ready several times. That chills
you to the marrow. The smell of the
corpses is awful. If they are not soon
buried there must be an outbreak of
disease. We sleep by the canal I
have slept well. October 28. Today
we again advanced. This is already
the twelfth flay of the battle, and
no decision yet: We have been un
der a fearful shell fire today It was
more fearful than anything I had
known before. It was as though the
world was coming to an end. I have
desired death that Hhis horror might
end. Butt as thouigh a miracle our
company had ho "wounded— only our
artillery. I am already quite worn
out. I can enjoy my food no longer.
Oh how happy were I could ^1 see
wife and child once again. But I no
longer believe that,possible. This
wholesale murder something hor
rible. We are vfigliting French
men now, and thej&slioot well. The
artillery I think, is ^better than ours.
If the Governments would only make
peace. There is en'cfugh breaking of
hearts already. It was very cold last
night, for there was frost on the
ground. In the trenches it is very
wet. How long shall yet hold out.
On the '27tli, I got the first news
from home. I I wjept Jn my excite

I am for them. I am fearfully cold
as I write this. I am wanting

my shirt twice, but my pants are
quite worn out. Perhaps I may find
some on a dead comrade. Need for

The battle gees on. This is the thir

So the diary ends, for the thir

little village in Western Prussia,
the death that he so longed for, the
release from all the horrors of the
dreadful conflict, and the French
soldier who buried him took from his

and gave it to our Belgian friend,
and I have pased it on you.
