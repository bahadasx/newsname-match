Was Eating Dinner.
"I was in the dining saloon of the
Persia ai 1:05 p. m.," he said. "I had
just finished my soup and the steward
was asking what I would take for my
second course when a terrific explo­
sion occurred.
"The saloon became filled with
smoke, broken glass and steam from
the boiler, which appeared to have
burst. There was no panic on board.
We went on deck as though at drill
and reported at the life boat on the
star board side as the vessel listed to
port. 1 clung to the railing. The last
thing done was to tie on Captain
Pricklcy's lifebelt.
Climbed On Wreckage.
"As the vessel was then listing so
heavily it was impossible to launch
the Btarboat boats, I slid down the
starboard rail into the water, and
climbed on some Wreckage.
"The last I saw ot the Persia she
had her bow in the air, five minutes
after the explosion."

Furnace company announced todav
that all employes, numbering r.000

iterated today that the American gov­
ernment, believes Austria's assuranco
in the Ancona note were given in
good l'aith.
Two points, it was emphasized,
must be cleared up before the next
move is made.
President Wilson's first act on liis
return was to issue a statement
through Secretary Tumulty, promis­
ing the country action just as soon
as the full fact3 in the Persia disas­
ter can be learned.
"The president and secretary of
state are taking every means possi­
ble to obtain full facts in this grave
matter and will act just as soon as
the information is obtained," saiJ
the statement.
The president's second step was to
direct Secretary Lansing to gather
more information from the Persia's
survivors. The secretary ordered the
consuls at Alexandria. Malta and Cai­
ro to obtain affidavits and at once
cable summaries of their contents.
iMenwhile, however, there is dis­
cussion of what steps the United
States may take, to make clear to
the Central Powers, belligerents as
allies, the extent to which it expects

Germans, Austrians, 'Turks,- or Bul
gars.
Austria's plea that she knew noth­
ing officially of the outcome of the
submarine controversy with Germany
is cited by one sei of officials who
favor taking action which might fore­
stall a similar plea by the other al­
lies when the United States has fin­
ished with Austria. Something defi­
nite along that line will probably be
developed soon.
It as disclosed today that the.
United States already haa delivered
to the American diplomatic repre­
sentatives in Turkey and Pulgaria
and to the Turkish and Bulgarian
diplomats here copies of the subma­
rine correspondence with Germany.
This is taken as an indication that
they will be kept informed of future
developments.
The latest developments of the cri­
sis for the first time brought the
president into conference with the
heads of the congressional commit­
tees which deal with foreign rela­
tions, and disclosed that they are to
be informed of any steps to be taken.
Administration leaders were uneasy
today over the prospects of an oppo­
sition attack in the senate on the ad­
ministration policy, but that fear was
relieved when the senate, after being
in session ten minutes, adjourned in
respect to the memory of the late
Justice Lamar. The house showed no
unneasiness, and the day, which had
begun with foreboding, passed over
without speech making, which the
administration feared might further
inflame the public mind.
