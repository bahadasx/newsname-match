SERVICE BILL
AGAIN TAKEN
UPBYBBITISH
Compulsory Act Is Being
Threshed Out for Second
Time in Great Britain.
STARRING UNRELIABLE
Methods Used to Distinguish
Eligibles Found Faulty
by Lord Derby.
London, Jan. 5 (3:43 p. m.) Under
the terms of the compulsory military
service bill, introduced in the house
of commons today, all males between
the ages of IS and 41 who are bach
elors or widowers without children
dependent on them are liable for mil
itary service. Ireland is excluded
from the terms of the measure.
Sir. Asquith opened his address with
an analysis of the figures in the Derby
r.ywrt. He emphasized the fact that
during the Derby campaign nearly
3,000,000 men had offered their serv
ices. Even deducting those rejected
on the ground of physical disability,
the total was still in excess of 2,.ri00
000.
"These are wonderful, encoura9
ing figures," the premier said. "They ;
ought to convince both our allies and :
our enemies that tV people of this
country have their hearts in the war." j
London, Jan. 4. 1 p. m. ( Delayed.) i
la the house of commons tomorrow j
(Wednesday i the compulsory military!
service will be taken up. It promises ;
to brins on the sharpest parliamentary i
struggle since the war began. J
The Ear! of Derby's report on his j
recruiting campaignyihiw?i boRim Oct. !
23 and ended Dec. 11. explains why the i
cabinet found it necessary to bring
forward a measure for compulsory en-1
listment of unmarried men. More j
than 2,500.001 men in England, Scot-j
land and Wales enrolled themselves,;
but after those engird in indispensa-'
ble industries and medically unfit have !
been winnowed out about 1,100.000 j
available to bear arms remain. But j
there are 650.000 unmarried men who ;
failed to come forward, and the gov
ernment will not attempt to redeem
Premier Asquith's pledge that the mar
ried men should not be called out as j
long as a considerable fraction of the.
unmarried men held back.
Starring Method Faulty. j
In his report, which is addressed to i
Earl Kitchener, secretary for war, the j
Earl of Derby says: j
"Many difficulties have been met I
with, but the chief difficulty has been '
the unreliability of starring, as dis-
tinguishing between those who should j
and those who should not be taken for
the army. Instead of starring being an i
assistance, it was a distinct hindrance j
to the canvass.
Farmers Hang Hack.
"More especially is this so in the
rural and semi-rural areas, owing to
the fact that it was known before reg
istration day what branches of the
agricultural industry would be starred,
with the result that many men who had
no right to do so, claimed to come un
der these particular headings. The
sense of unfairness thus created and
the inequality of treatment to farmers
has been most detrimental in these
areas. The farmer himself is not a
starred man, but there are numberless
cases of his sons and laborers being
starred as cowmen, horsemen, etc.,
though in many instances, it is known
they are not really so engaged.
"It is essential that the starred list
should be carefully investigated and in
cases of misdescription the star re
moved and the man made available for
military service. This applies to
starred men In all industries.
"The issue during the process of the
canvass of list of trades which were
to be considered 'reserved occupa
tions' has also proven an obstacle. I
recognize It was essential that such
lists Bhould be Issued, but the fact re
mains that trades other than those
mentioned in those lists have been ap
plying to be Included, and the men en-

90 men of the crew of the Creek steam- j
er Thessaloniki are believed today to j
be adrift in lifeboats at sea more .than
300 miles southeast of Sandy Hook, j

took to the beats.
MAKES PLEA FOR
OFFERING JEWS
Kansas City, Mo.. Jan. 5. A plea for
the suffering Jews of Europe was
made by Rabbi Harrison of St. Louis
to the Federation of Jewish charities
at its annual dinner here last night.
Rabbi Harrison told of the courage of
the Jews in the vanguard of the Rus
sian armies and said that their wives,
fathers and sisters were insulted in
the very country for which they were
fighting.
"The greatest war of history is rag
ing now," he said. "In the awful area
swept by cannon fire, on side of the
battle front, between Teutons and Slav,
are nearly six million Jews. Half a
million Polish Jews wander in beg
gary today. Their plight is beyond
description."
PLAN AMERICAS'
AERO CONTESTS
New York, Jan. 5. The Aero Club
of America, announced today an offer
of a $10,000 trophy to be competed for
by representatives of North and South
America, and to be known as the Pan-1
American aviation trophy. This offer is j
intended as an endorsement of the plan
of Alberto Santos-Dumont, who sug
gested to the Pan-American congress
in Washington that thousands of aero
planes could be used on this continent
to solve difficult problems of transpor
tation and would form a valuable re
serve in defense of the nations of
America,
WOULD UNITE THREE
MEDICAL SCHOOLS
Chicago, Jan. 5. Physicians con
nected with Rush Medical college
which is affiliated with the University
of Chicago; the Medical college of
Northwestern university, and the med
ical college of the University of Illi
nois, have launched a movement to
combine the Institutions.
According to plans, It was said to
a ih three colleges would retain
their present university affiliation but
would cooperate in sucn a way mat
teht take a desired course
in any of the institutions or might use
the advantage of all three.
The idea has been proposed in the
interest of efficiency and economy.
Outbreak by
HaitianClan
Reported
Port Au Prince, Haiti, Jan. 5. A
revolutionary outbreak occurred at 2
o'clock this morning at Port Au
Prince. The force of American ma
rines maintained in this city was at
tacked. One of the rebels was killed
by the Americans, who suffered no
losses.
Several groups of insurrectionists
moved on Grand Prevot and ran
through the streets, discharging rifles.
The Americans met them and they
were rapidly dispersed.
The outbreak is condemned and has
been characterized as a piece of folly.
After the assassination of President
Guillaume by a mob last July, in the
course of the revolution, American
forces were landed in Haiti. Under the
agreement made substantially between
the United States and Haiti, American
forces are being maintained on the is
land for police purposes. In Septem
ber the rebels reached an understand
ing with the American military auth
orities under which they were to dis
arm. Quiet has prevailed since that
time and there has been nothing to
indicate that the disturbance now re
ported is of importance.
DURANCE HIGH
ON SUEZ ROUTES
New York, Jan. 5. The activity of
submarines in the Mediterranean sea
caused an advance in war risk insur
ance by local companies today on car
goes for Mediterranean ports and ship
ments for the far east through the
Suez canal. A rate of 10 per cent is
quoted on cargoes in ships of bellig
erent countries, as compared with
three-eighths of one per cent before
the sinking of the Ancona and the
Yasaka Maru.
Underwriters say the rate is advanc
ed to discourage requests for insur
ance, and that their action was sug
gested by information from London
that Lloyds have virtually refused to
write war risks on Mediterranean bus
iness. War risks on vessels to Scandina
vian and United Kingdom ports re
main where they have been for several

BULLETIN.
London, Jan. .", (4:23 p. m.)
The American embassy here has
received a report sajing that the
Rev. Homer R. Salisbury, an
American, was a passenger on the
liner Persia which was sunk in
the Mediterranean, but that he was
not included among the survivors.
London, Jan. 4, (7:35 n. m.) (de
layed). An Amsterdam Ex
change Telegraph company says
that the American ambassador at
Berlin, James W. Gerard, con
ferred today with officials at the
foreign office concerning the
sinking of the steamship Persia.
Mr. Gerard is said to have in
quired about the nationality of
the submarine which sank the
vessel.
The German secretary of the
navy, Admiral von Tirpitz, con
ferred with Emperor William on
Monday.
Washington, Jan. 5. Only two
Americans were on the Persia when
she was sunk, the American consul
at Marseilles .today advised the state
department, Robert McNeely of
North Carolina and Charles H. Grant
of Boston.
President Wilson conferred with Sec
retary Lansing for an hour today over
the submarine crisis. No additional
facts, beyond the definite knowledge
that only two Americans were aboard
the liner Persia, had been received by
the state department overnight. Rob
ert M. McNeely, American consul at
Aden, Arabia, is missing. C. H. Grant
of Boston was saved.
Whether the status of the Persia was
changed from an unarmed liner to that
of a vessel which might technically be
classified as armed by the fact that she
mounted one gun, United States navy
experts will be called on to help deter
mine. Anxiously Await Xews.
The administration continued to
day to mark time in the situation
arising from the sinking of the Brit
ish steamer Persia while awaiting
definite information concerning the
attack on the vessel. Until the full
facts are at hand, however, the next
move in the new crisis with the Teu
tonic powers will not be determined
on.
President Wilson, who is person
ally directing the policy of the United
States, has taken steps to ascertain
as speedily as possible the facts in
the case. Information is being sought
as to whether the Persia actually
was torpedoed and, if so, what was
the nationality of the submarine. Un
til these points are cleared up no
move probably will be made by the
Washington government.
Affidavits Are Ordered.
Acting on instructions from the
president, Secretary Lansing has or
dered American consular officers to
obtain affidavits from the survivors
of the Persia and immediately to ca
ble summaries of their contents. A
report also is awaited from Ambassa
dor Penfield at Vienna regarding his
inquiries to the Austrian foreign of
fice. Possibility that the next move on
the part of the United States will be
to make it plain to the central pow
er belligerents, as allies, the extent
to which it Intends to hold them re
sponsible for submarine warfare
which is not in accordance with ac
cepted principles of international law,
was a subject of discussion here to
day. While the situation here still was
as tense as ever, officials were hope
ful that a new way would be found
for an amicable settlement of the is
sue. IGNORES SUBPOENA

WOULDHAVECASE
OF ENGLISH TRIED
BEFORE TRIBUNAL
London, Jan. 4, 8 p. m. (Delayed.)
Sinking of the White Star liner Ar
abic, destruction of a British submar
ine by a German destroyer on the
Danish coast and the submarine at
tack on the British steamer Ruel are
the three incidents that Sir Edward
Grey, the British foreign secretary,
suggests for submission to some im-j
partial tribune for investigation, to
gether with the case of the Baralong.
The foreign secretary notes in his
reply to Ambassador Page's communi
cation of a memorandum from the Ger
man government complaining of cir
cumstances alleged to have attended
the destruction of a German submar
ine by the British auxiliary cruiser
Baralong, that the three Incidents in
question occurred within 48 hours of
the time the Baralong sank the sub
marine. "It is evident that to single out the
case of the Baralong for particular
examination would be the height of
absurdity," says the secretary. "Even
were the allegations on which the Ger
man government rely accepted as they
stand and his majesty's government
does not so accept them the charge
against the commander and crew of
the Baralong is negligible compared
with the crimes which have been de
liberately committed by German offi
cers both on land and sea against
combatants and non-combatants."
OUST OFFICIALS
TO AVENGE COP
Atlanta, Ga., Jan. 5. The question
of whether or not to recall from office
Mayor Woodward and five members of
the local board of police commission
ers was before Atlanta voters at a
special election today. Efforts are be
ing made to oust the six officials be
cause they reduced -Chief of Police J.
L. Beavers to a captaincy. Beavers, in
1912, became widely known for abol
ishing the local restricted district.
Beavers was reduced in rank last July,
on charges on insubordination, it being
claimed that he took orders not from
the board of police commissioners, of
which the mayor is an ex-officio mem
ber, but from a number of so-called
reformers.

THE WAR TODAY
Premier Asquith today intro
duced in the house of commons a
bill for compulsory military ser
vice. A bill facilitating the production
of munitions has been passed by
the British house of commons.
Activity in the actual field of
war is confined mainly at present
to the front in Galicia and the lies
sarabian front.
Introduction in the British house
of commons of the bill dealing
with compulsory military service
is set for today. The 651,160 un
married men eligible for military
service who failed to come forward
to attest themselves under the
Earl of lerhy's recruiting plan are
not considered a "negligible
quantity," hence decision of the
cabinet to redeem Premier As
qnith's pledge to the married men
that they would not be railed out
while any considerable proportion
of the single men were holding
bach.

committee appointed to Investigate
them. Both reports also found the
shipping interests blameless of Illegal
activity in opposition to the measure.
Roosevelt Denounced.
The majority denounced Theodore
Roosevelt for failing to appear before
the committee to testify concerning hia
published assertion that President Wil
son and Secretary Bryan, "had en
deavored in the interest of certain for
eign business firms to secure for the
United States the power to purchase
the interned sLIps of one of the bellig
erents." The charge, the report said,
had Its origin "in that ungenerous trait
of the human mind which makes it
prone to attribute unworthy motives to
redoubtable rivals and particularly po
litical antagonists."
Majority Finds "o Evidence.
While the committee found no evi
dence to indicate that the president or
secretary harbored any purpose to buy
Interned ships, the majority held that
it was difficult to conceive of reasons
consistent with the most exalted mo
tives that might induce the president
I to refrain from a public declaration
Ithat belligerent's ships would be
bought.
"Such an action," said the report,
"would rightly be construed as an
abandonment of our rights which our
nation has vigorously maintained, to
acquire merchant ships by bpnaflde
purchase, though a state of war exists
involving the nation under whose flag
they previously sailed."
Called Bad Legislation.
Senator Sutherland presented the
minority report for himself and Sena
tor Penrose. "We do not concur," it
said, "in so far as the report defends
the bill itself nor In so far as it in
sists there would be no Impropriety In
the purchase of the belligerent's idle
ships. We believe the bill a thorough
ly bad piece of legislation and are cer
tain that to have purchased the boats
now seeking security in American har
bors would have developed serious
trouble for the United States."
The committee's investigation was
authorized by a resolution offered by
Senator Burton and an amendment by
Senator Williams, directing the In
quiry as to whether the so-called ship
ping trust had maintained a lobby
against the bill.
