American Citizen Drowned.
The British liner Persia carrying
approximately two hundred passen
gers. and a crew of between two hun
dred and fifty and three hundred men
was sunk by an unidentifind subma
rine at one o'clock Thursday after
noon off the Island of Crete, in the
Eastern LMediterranean.
Unofficial dispatches from Cairo
state that the British steamship
Persia was torpedoed without warn
ing and sank in five minutes. Be
tween one hundred and fifty and one
hundred and sixty survivors have
been landed at Alexandria, Egypt.
Robert N. McNeely, American con
sul at Aden, Arabia, is believed to
have been drowned. Reuter's Cairo
correspondent makes the unreserved
statement that Mr. McNeely lost his
1ife. Charles H. Grant of Boston was
saved.
Details of the sinking of the Persia
came in slowly, but they irdicated
that the number of persons who es
caped in the four boats which were
put off was larger than was hoped 1
when the first news was received.
The Peninsula and Oriental com
pany, which owned the Persia, an
nounced that one hundred and fifty
eight survivors had arrived at Alex
andria.
The survivors comprise the chief
officer, second officer, seven engi
neers, twenty-seven seamen, sixty
three Lascars and fifty-nine passen- t
gers. A Lloyd dispatch gives the num- I
ber as one hundred and fifty-three,
made up of fifty-nine parsengers of
whom seventeen are women and
ninety-four members of the crew, in
cluding fifty-nine 'Lascars. The sur
vivors Include ten military cfficers t
and eight persons who are not Brit- f
ish' subjects. C
"The ship was struck amidships on X
the port side at one-ten a. m." says
Reuter's correspondent at Cairo. E
"She had disappeared completely by
one-fifteen.
"Survivors say it was little short
of a miracle that any one was saved.
There was no panic. Four boats
were launched with the utmost
promptitude. .
"The captain was drowned. When
last seen he was swimming after the
liner had plunged. beneath the sur
face."
Only one dispatch concernmg the b
sinking of the, Perpia has been re- s
ceived by the -state department. It u
came. from Consul Garrels at Alex- m
andrii. Fgypt, and indicated that n
Consul .McNeely, q, his way to his .o
post, -had been 19k He was last i
seen in the water before the steam- a
ship went down. -f
Consul Garrels a reported that P
Charles H. Grant of Boston, another p
American aboard the Persia, was
among the survivors.
-No submarine was seen by the sur
vivors, according to the consul's re
port, but an officer of the ship says 3
he saw the wake of a trpcdo. The
-Perria went down in five minutes.
Cable communication with the East
is so slo~w that detals of the disaster
are not expcted for a day or two. a
The Persia sailed fre.'n London on i
December 18 for Bombay, with sixty- t:
one first class passengcrs and eighty- '
three second cabin p--zsengers, in- .t
eluding eight children. Some of these, U
including Edward Rose, a Denver 0
school boy, were lhnded at Gibraltar, te
Marseilles and Malta. At Marseilles b
two hundred and thirty-one passen- 0
gers, including eighty-seven women 0
and twenty-five children, were taken P
aboard but line officials say that
after deducting those leaving the 0
ship at various ports of call, somg t:
*thing more thsn two hundred pas- 0
sengers were on the vessel, a
A majority of the Persia's passen- t
gers were British, bound for India, ~
including many women. Her cargo 1
was small but she carried a heavy
consignment of mail. The crew was tl
made up princi-pally of Lascars. S
Sixty-one first class passengers and a
eighty-three cabin passengers, includ- a
ing eight children, boarded. the ~
steamship at London, according to
r information obtained from the Penin
'. sular and Oriental line.
At Marseilles thirty-five of the first
class and thirty-two of the second
cabin boarded the boat. The com- t
pany estimates that after deducting
the number of passengers leaving the
ship at her various ports of call about
one hundred and sixty passengers
were aboard when the vessel was 0
sunk.a
The crew of the Persia numbered ~
between two hundred and fifty and '
three hundred men. They were near-p
ly all Lascars. There was not much c
cargo aboard the Persia, but she wasp
carrying very heavy mail. The yes
sel carried no war materials..
The Peninsular and Oriental i
Steamship company Sunday night re- d
ceived the following telegram from
Col. C. C. Bigham, who was among
the survivors of the Persia disaster: 0
"A torpedo struck the ship on the v
port bow at one-five o'clock in thei
afternoon when about forty miles t
south of the east end of the island of
Crete. No warning was given nor any
attempt to assist. Within five min
utes the ship had sunk.
"It was impossible to lower the G
starboard boats, owing to the heavy
list. Five or six boats were lowered
on the port side. I did not see this
myself' as I was washed overboard cl
when the boat capsized-.s
"The conduct of the passengers G
and crew was splendid, there was no F
struggling and no panic. Four boats es
after thirty hours at sea were pick- is
ed up by a warship." s

ALIES WIN WITH MEN
'ar Correspondent Declares That
Xaiser Must Go Down In Defeat
Because the Allies Have an Over
whelming Superiority in Ships, in
Men and in Money.
John Reed recently returned to
w York after a sojourn with the
ssian armies in the eastern war
int, and a tour through the Balkan
ttes. Earlier in 1915 he had been
th the German armies in the west
d was convinced of their invinci
ity. He was correspondent of The
w York World during the Mexican
rolution. Otherwise Mr. Reed's
r correspondence has been done for
) Metropolitan Magazine.
Observations made during a year
travel in Europe, where I visited
gland, France, Germany, Belgium,
rbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece,
ssia and Italy-all the belliger
ts except Austria-have convinced
i that Germany is already beaten,
I that the war will be ended by
ct autumn with the withdrawal of
) German armies from the con
wed lands.
[ don't see how there was ever a
sibility of Germany's winning the
r, unless she managed somehow to
ash one of the three. great allies
mnce, Russia or England. Any one
these three out of it, she could
ly have triumphed. Italy I don't
tsider one of the vital factors in
> struggle; she would have been
a.l only if she had thrown her lot
:h the central powers, and hung
e a snapping dog on the flanks of
mee. Had she remained neutral,
ultimate result must have been
same-Victory for the Triple En
te.
ro my mind it is a question of
ps, men and money. Almost all
bulletin board strategists at the
break of the war calculated on
.t basis. But the great German
ve on Paris, and the fighting on
Aisne-when on the map which
ig against the wall of my room in
ais I followed the official com
niques and watchedthe apparent
inevitable Teuton advance-and
n the monstrous crumbling of the
ssian front, and fiLally the annihi
ion of Serbia, made us feel that
haps superior organization, speed
i mobility of forces were the de
mining factors.
3y a miracle of organization -the
mch and British got themselves
ether in the west so that German
>eriority in that regard was can
ed. On the eastern front the Rus
s were pressed.as far as Russians
. be pressed, and the line reached

tion in the public mind about Ger
ny's resources in these matters.
ust because copper telephone
'es and copper kettles and copper
inies were requisitioned, it doesn't
an that Germany's supplies of that
tal have run out. The shortage

.s for food, the newspaper tales of
sad tickets, bread riots, starving
men and children, soldiers on the

ang idea of conditions in Germany.

Qermany can feed herself for seven
trs with a normal increase of popu
ion. It is not so easy now as it

Sbearing and the reclaimed land
worked. Germany must econo
e for the time between harvests,
t is all. And I may add that when
ras in Berlin, last February, food
t less than it did in London.
So it is not an immediate ques
on of food, money, munitions or
ren ships. The war will be defi
itely won on land, and wvon with
ie preponderance of fighting men.
he question is, will the Allies, all
mditions on both sidles being
lual, be able to dominate in sheer
umbers of men? I think they will.
nd I don't believe that there is a
nubt of it in the mind of any one
ho knows the relative populations
the belligerents, and the percent
ge of useful men in any such pop
lation.
But an they shoot ealyehI?1
In my opinion all the soldieis now
are about equal in efficiefty. In
fantry and artillery training doesn't
vary among the different armies as
much as we think. No country in the
modern world has any war secrets
that all the other countries a-en't
familiar with.
Of course the German troops Are
trained to obey orders implicitly, and
in a tight place they will act like a
machine-without thought or will;
and the French and English are al
lowed a liberty of thought and action
which sometimes results in costly
blunders, and sometimes in impos
sible victories; and Russians are
dogged, terrible fighters under good
leadership, and stupid under bad.offi
cers, but taken as a whole in train
ing and in military equipment 'both
sides are equal.
But you will insist that since this
is a question of mere numbers of
men, the Germans will take the de
fensive as soon as they are pressed,
and that the cost of attacking Ger
many will . more than offset the
numerical superiority of the Allies.
That would indeed be partially true
if the character of defensive warfare
had not materially changed.
Many officers in active service in
every one of the couintries I visited
told me of this change. In the first
six months of the war the proportion
of casualties in the attacking force
was about seventy per cent. to thirty
in the defending ranks. This was
now modified, they said, on account
of trench mortars and other new fac
tdrs; so that fifty-five per cent. on
the attacking side were lost to forty
five per cent. on the defensive.
Then, too, such is .now -the condi
tion of things that at. the present
time any side can take a trench by
superior concentration of artillery
and infantry at a given poirt, and
the enemy's counter-attack can regain
the trench by the same means-both
sides now counter-attacking invari
ably-so that one side loses approxi
mately what the other side loses.
Of course, if these things are true,
the numbers of fighting men avail
able are the important thing, and we
shall not see the Germans impreg
nably intrenched 'beyond the Rhine
when the day comes that they with
draw from the conquered lands.
I think it will be generally ad
mitted that that first great German
army which poured down over Bel
gium and France like a *gray 'ava
lanche is gone. The best the Ger
mans can muster in fighting men is
some eight millions and that includes
many incapables. The official Ger
man lists of dead, disabled and pris
oners totals almost four millions.
Grant that the Allies. have lost as
many .men as the Central Empires:
still Russia and England have un
touched resources in cannon food.
A German military attache in a
neutral capital informed me that the
Central Powers' losses in the -drive
against-Russia were twenty per cent.
permanent losses of twenty-five hun
dred thousand men. And I know of
cases where men past military -age,.
who were exempt on aceaint of phys-I
sical infirmities, and eveD scientistsi
needed in the work of making army
supplies, have been called 'to the
colors and are already dead in the
front trench'Os. Germany is 'cettain
ly getting short of men.
The progress of the war san far
shapes itself, to me, in three desper
ate attempts by the Germans to
smash their opponents' power. At
the beginning they drove at France,
and the battle of the Marne marked
their failure. After a minor blow at
England in the vain attempt to gain
Calais they tried to smash Russia;
but the very essential of any at
tempt to cripple the northern empire,
the destruction of the main Russian
army, also failed on account of Gen.
Alexieff's masterly retreat from War
saw.
Then followed the 'drive on Serbia
and the entry into Constantinople;
and that is nothing more, nor less
than a blow at the British empire.
For Constantinople is of no-'value in
itself; it can only be the stepping
stone 'to a much vaster project-an
expedition against Egypt and, the
Suez canal, or against India by way
of Bagdad, or both.
But in the final show down, where
could Germany find the men to hold
open the line from Hungary to Con
stantirnople, keep a-'strong hold over
European Turkey, and advance to
Bagdad or to Egypt,-besides the
thousands of workmen needed to
build railroads across trackless coun
tries, arrange for provisions and
water, organize new army units: flat
ter and fight the Arabs, and run the
Turkish Empire as she is now doing?
Where could Germany get these
millions of meni? She can 'not'
withdraw troops from the western
front, where every month sees the
French and English grow in
sterngth, organization and power.
She can not take them from her
eastern front, where the rallying
Russians are already making her
reel. Even the Italian front is
keeping busy a steadily greater
army all the time. So, in order to
beat England, France and Russia,
Germany must conquer the world,
which it can not do.
When I was in Constantinople the
Turkish newspapers published about
a column of "peace rnews" every day.
Every rumor of peace, every whisper
of conciliation, was given the widest
and most serious presentation
Bryan's reported peace trip, Ford's
plan, the utterances of the Pope, an
interview with a Cardinal and procla
mations by the various German socie
ties outlining their idea of the con
ditions under which peace should be
concluded by Germany.
Now, all the news of Europe
came through the German embassy
and was controlled by it. And it
was evident that the, subject of
peace was an absorbingly interest
ing one to the Central powers.
Moreover, we know that Austria
has attempted to arrange a separate
peace with Serbia, that at the height
of German success against Russia
Germany twice offered Russia a sep
arate peace. And now, in the middle
of Germany's widest and most spec
tacular swing, when it seems to the
layman as if the last thing Germany
should desire was a settlement, Chan
cellor von Bethmanni-HollWeg an
nounces that the German empire will
consider proposals from the Allies
looking toward peace.
For the Germans know that a peace
concluded now or in the next four
months will be the best peace Ger
many can ever make. The burst of
glory now taking place is Germany's
last great bluff. Soon she will not
have the men to make great smash
ing drives. Perhaps even now she
won't be able to finish what she has
begun. And when the moment comes
that she must withdraw slowly from
the conquered lands and -make her
shrinking battle line smaller, then I
think the German common sense will
face candid? the knowledge that a
last-trencf defense is useless, and
that it is the end--not the beginning
,o thend.

d - ported Wake of Torpedo is Regard
a
I- ed as Peculiar-Baron Zwiedinek
't is Confident His Government Will
e atisfactorily Adjust the Matter.
n Anxiety over the news of the sink
r ing of the British steamship Persia
r, increased in official -circles at Wash
e ington when a. consular dispatch
- brought the information Sunday that
I. the ship had been torpedoed without
g warning and that at least one Ameri
e can citizen, Robert 'N. MeNeely, new
Ll consul at Aden, Arabia, was missing;
At the same time officials were
much gratified at the indication,
emanating from Baron Erich Zwiedi
nek, charge of the Austro-Hungarian
embassy that the Vienna government
would ,be quick to "satisfactorily ad
just'- the matter should it develop
7 that an Austrian commander had dis
s obeyed instructions- in' regard to the
torpedoing of passenger-carrying
ships without warning.
"Judgment should be withheld
pending the receipt of the facts, sur
round' ig the sinking of the steamer
Persia," said Baron Zwiedinek. "It
m-y have happened in many 'ways.
In the first place, it is not yet proved
that a submarine, sank the Persia.
If it was an Austrian submarine it
must be determined whether the 'cir
cumstances were such as to warrant
. the action taken.
"I am confident, at least I hope,
- that the 'final explanation will' be
I quite satisfactory. If the commander
s of the submarine disobeyed his in
i structions I fiel sure my government
r will not hesitate to satisfactorily ad
- just the matter.
- - "From' the answer made to the last
note on the Ancona alone it is quite
i evident that the Austro-Hungarian
- government will not countenance any
5 act which Is wrong."
Complete confidence prevails in
Teutonic diplomatic circles that if an
Austrian submarine sank the Persia
without warning the act. would be
disavowed prbmptly, reparation made
for Americans lost and the submarine
commander severely punished.
- It is understood that Baron Zwiedi
nek will call upon Secretary Lansing
for the purpose of informally convey
ing his views on the subject of and
endeavoring to 'gain an understand
ng of the views of the United States
for the informationof his-govern
ment.
. -.While Secretary Lansing declined
to 'comment on the situation con
fronting the United States, it became
known that he and other adininistra
tion:.officials. were awaiting full in
- formation befo-e forming.an-opinion
and determining upon any'action.
Officials expressed themselves as
not being convinced that a subma
I rine sank the Persia. They were im
pressed by the statement in the dis
patch from Alexandria that the wake
of the torpedo had been seen, al
though no submarine wps visible.
Navy officials said they would con
sider it out of the ordinary, although
not impossible that a torpedo fired by
a submerged submarine should leave
ta visible wake.
-Disenssion of the case showed that
Sofficials generally felt that the Unit
ted States had about come to the end
of its rope in conducting diplomatic
negotiations over submarine war
fare. There was no inclination to
minimize the gravity of the situation
which would develop if it was proved
that' an Austrian submarine sank the
Persia and a prompt disavowal from
Vienna was not forthcoming. It was
thought possible, however, that the
IVienna' government may see fit to fol
low the example set by Germany upon
the sinking of the Arabic.
The Arabic was torpedoed at a
time when it appeared that the sub
.marine controversy with Germany
was on the road to settlement. A
week later Count, von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, received in
structions to assure the United States
government that full satisfaction
"more than a disavowal" would be
given by the Berlin government
-should the circumstances as they
-were repor.ted proved to be correct.
Should the developments warrant
it and should the mystery surround
ing the nationality of the submarine
I remain unsolved the United States, it
-was said, probably will address in
-quiries to Austria-Hungary, Germany
-and Turkey, the only nations whose
rsubmarines might be in the eastern
.Mediterranean. .*
SThe inquiries necessarily would
thave to be sent to all three nations,
although it is .believed certain In all
Squarters that Austria-Hungary is the
-only one of the Teutonic allies with
- submarines in those waters. This be
i lief is -based primarily upon a state
- ment recently made by Count von
SBernstorff to the effect that no Ger
Sman or Turkish submarines were
Sknown to be operating there.
Any action taken by the United
States will be based upon affidavits
from passengers.,.particularly Ameri
cans, rather than upon officers of the
ship. Final decision as to what ac
tion, if any, is to be taken will be
made by the president, who will re
turn to Washington from Hot Springs
in a day or two. Several points re
I main to pe cleared up..
I Tlid state department especially de
- sires additional corroboration of the
3statement that the wake of a torpedo
i was seen. It regards as being signi
ficant the statement that the vessel
- went down in five minutes and de
r sires all details upon this point, al
though it is assumed that Consul Gar
rels based the statement upon infor
mation recei'ved from passengers.
3 It is understood that the Lusitania
- and the Ancona negotiations will be
allowed to remain in their present
status until more definite details re
garding the sinking of the Persia are
at hand.
Teofficial text of Austria's An
cona note was received early Friday
at the state department in Washing
ton. The work of translating from.
thie diplomatic code will take several
hours 'and arrangements for publica
