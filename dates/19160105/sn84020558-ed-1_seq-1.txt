Everywhere in the Stripa and
Volhnian districts of Russia and
in east Galicia, the Russians are
on the offensive, the official com
munications from both Petrograd
and Vienna reveal.
Czernowitz, capital of Buko
wina, is now the position around
which the most important fight
ing is in progress. A Reuter dis
patch from Petrograd gives a re"
Port of the evacuation of Czerno
witz and the capture by the Rus
sians of a largo number of pris
oners including Germans.
On none of the other fronts has
any change of importance taken
place. T'te Austrians have cap
tured an Italian trench near Tol
mino, and the Montenegrins have
recaptured Bogievac from the
Austrians.
Unofficial advices from Athens
report 30,000 Bulgarians as having
reached the region of Tirana,
northwest of Elbassan in Al
bania, and that Albanian irreg
ulars, commanded by Bulgarian
officers, have exchanged shots
with the Italian outposts near
Durazzo on the Adriatic.
Out of 5,014,414 men of mil
itary age in England, Scotland
and Wales, 2,829,263 were at
tested, enlisted or rejected under
the Earl of Derby's recruiting
scheme, leaving 2,182,173 men who
did not offer their services. Of
the men who did come forward,
423,853 wero rejected by the re
cruiting officers.
While President Wilson has
returned to Washington and taken
Personal charge of the situation
created by the sinking of the
Steamer Persia, the situation for
the present is at a standstill as
no action will be taken until the
full facts as far as they can be
obtained are in the hands of the

RETURN OF PRESIDENT
DOES NOT LESSEN THE
SUBMARINE CRISIS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. Jan. I. There was
no lessening of the tension in the new'
submarine crisis today with President
Wilson's retur.i to the While House
to take Personal charge of the situa
tion, but there were marked indica
tions of the president's intention to
proceed carefully and deliberately be
fore committing the I'nited States to
i lie next step in its already strained
relations with the Teu'onie powers.
At the state department the hop'
was expressed that there would be
opportunity to settle the cilsis amica
bly and it was stated that the Amer
ican government believed that Aus
tria's assurances in the Ancona note
were given in good faith.
Two points, ii was emphasized must
be cleared up iiefore the next move is
made. It must tie established whether
the British liner Persia actually was
torpedoed, and if so, what was the
nationality of the, submarine.
President Wilson's first act on his
return was to is-ue a statement
through Secretary Tumulty promising
the country action just as soon as
the full facts in the Persia disaster
can be learned.
"The president and the secretary
of stale are taking every means pos
sible to obtain the full facts in this
..rave matter a, id wiil act just as soon
as the information is obtained," said
the of filial statement issued at the.
White House offices.
The president's, second step was to
direct Secretary Ijhis'iik t- gather
more information from the Persia sur
vivors. The secretary ordered the con
suls at .Alexandria. Malt'' and 'airei
to obtain affidavits and at once cable
summaries of their contents.
Until that information is obtained,
or until Ambassador Penfiob! reports

.Meanwhile, however, there is. dis
cussion as to what steps the United

central powers and their- allies the
extent to which it expects to hold
them responsible fur submarine oper
ations hi violation of intel national
law, be thev conduct d hy Germans,
Austrians. Turks or Bulgarians.
Austria's plea that siie knew noth
ing of the outcome of the submarine
controversy with Germany is recalled
by one set ut officials, who favor tak
ing action .which mi'jht forestall a
similar plea by the other allies when
the United States has finisneel with
Austria. .Something definite along
that line probably will be de eloped

It was disposed todav il.al the
United States already had delivered

mats here copies of the submarine
correspondence with Germany. This

be kept informed of future develop
ments. '
The latest de e'opments of the
crisis for the first time brought the
president into conference with the
heads of tin congressional committees
which d;-al with foreign relations ano
disclosed that thev are to oe informed
of the coming stcos.
Approbation of this course was ex
pressed by senators and representa

the sale by the United States to Oreece

any secrets of gunfire control to the
Orcek government, or that while sec

written to influence him against Aga

ister to the United States. He also
said he had not heard criticisms al
leged to have been made of him by
Schliemann.
According to .Mr. Bryan, the sale of
the battleships was a matter which
rested entirely with the navy depart
ment. He admitted that gunfire con
trol secrets might have been divulge-!
by h navv department without his
knowledge or that "the state depart
