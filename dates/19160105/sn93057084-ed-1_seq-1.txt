Forest City, with its other

Sunday School, while eyen its

INDIAN MAKES
BIG MISTAKE
An Indian made the mistake of
offering Ye Editor a "dthrink" of
New Years whisky the other night
in Forest City. We are informed
that his supply came from Agar.
This would be a clear case for
your courts, in the eyes of some

..white man first gave it to him.
And "Uncle Sam" showed him
how by setting him up in business
under a special federal permit.
Please tell us which of these
three is the biggest sinner.

Every town of importance in East

Many of the destroyed towns are so

planning for a series of municipally

parts, the upper of which incloses the
switchboard and fuses, and the lower,

access to the switches and fuses, while
a cover plate securely screwed in place

the meter, which, however, is visible
for reading. The box is supported on
a substantial framework several feet

Beautifying ths Streets.
Palms lining the downtown side
walks comprise a unique feature of
city boautification in Los Angeles, Cal.
The work of installing has just been
completed, says the National Real Es
tate Journal.
Along 50 blocks of the heart of the
city have been placed 1,100 splendid
specimens of the Chamerops Excel
sas palms. The work was done by the
county at an expense of some $20,
000, as part of a general beautifica
tion scheme for California expositions
this year. The improvement is de
signed to be permanent.
Delicate trailing vines and nastur
tiums have been planted about the
roots of the trees and give a green
and flower effect against the brown
trunks. J-V, y-"'
The palms are set in wooden tubs,
which in turn are placed in cement
boxes. The lowest branches are about
eight feet above the sidewalk. The

singer, who once "starred" in Paris,
received from a Muscovite prince a
handsome brooch set with diamonds.
But not wishing to accept a gift, the
motive of which might be miscon

thanks. The next day she received a
letter from the prince approving high

this letter had a singularly glistening
