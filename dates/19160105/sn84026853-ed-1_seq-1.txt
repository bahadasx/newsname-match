IMPORTANT WORK
FOR LEGISLATURE
MANY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
TO ENGAGE THE COMING
SESSION.
Columbia, Jan. 1.?One of the big
problems; to come before the General
Assembly will be the strengthening
of the progressive laws that were enacted
at the last session. The object
uppermost in the mind of Gov.
Manning just now is to make . these
laws more effective.
It is impossible to predict just
what course the Legislature will take
on the many matters that will be
presented, yet it is certain that prac- |
tically all of the members will play .
politics to some extent. Next summer
many of the solons will go on
the stump to ask for reelection and
they will try to make a good record
of a local nature to influence votes.
The first great aim of the Legislature
this year will be to hold down
appropriations. The various institu- ]
tions which have claims upon the
General Assembly might as well be '
prepared to have their amounts cut
down. It is certain that the Legislature
will not increase the appropriations
over last year and in no event
will the tax levy be increased. The
chairmen of the finance committee of :
the House are disposed to work out
some plan whereby the levy will be
decreased.
Much important work is being undertaken
by the State government |
just now and the leaders will see to
it tnar none 01 trie aeparunenus are
crippled for a lack of finances.
Several of the State institutions
will be asking for appropriations to .
I erect new buildings. At the pres- |
ent time there is little chance for ,
| these sums to pass in the app *opri- j
ation bill. Gov. Manning wiii watch |
the appropriation bill with an eagle
eye and certain items are certain
to be eliminated.
Educational Issues^
Gov. Manning is very^jfcHrch interested
in the common scnool system
of the State and he will use his power ,
to strengthen these schools in every ;
way. J. E. Swearingen, State superintendent
of education, has al- j
ready stated that he will ask for an ''
appropriation of $400,000 for the
common schools of the State. The
common schools will get this amount
if there is enough to go around.
I The Legislature will very probably
spend some time in discussing the
compulsory education law which was
, enacted at the last session. It is not
probable that the law will be made
State-wide at this session. It is prob-1
' -1-1 - 11.-1 -11- - .UilJ limi'f
auie tnut uic tuuu >auui age * ?
will be raised to 14 years from 12. ,
I It is argued that the age limit should
be the same as provided by the com- |
, pulsory education measure. The ',
I compulsory law has been adopted by i
[many districts in the State.
j The strengthening of the law govI
erhing the State warehouse system 1
will be another problem for the Legislature.
During the past several
weeks Gov. Manning and John L. Mc.
Laurin, State warehouse commission
er, have held a series of conference
when chanees in the law were dis- j
'cussed. While nothing of an official
nature has been announced it is un- ]
derstood that the proposed changes 1
will include a special commmission
to have charge of the system. The '
commissioner would work under the I'
I fUio nAmmioci'nn TVlO I
UUCt UUll UA UUO *yv |
people of the State are in the dark i
so far as to what has been accomplished
by the cotton warehouse sys- *
tem, yet it is said that the report of 1
Mr. McLaurin will show that much
has been done of a beneficial nature 1
to the farmer. Mr. McLaurin has '
refused to give out his report until '
the General Assembly opens. He i
said that many important questions 1
were discussed. \
Tax Commission Law.
It is practically certain that the j
law creating the State tax commisIsion
will be amended at this session. (
(The bankers of the state are fight- !
ing the commission and it is rumored J
that certain members of the Senate
will oppose the confirmation of the
appointment of A. W. Jones, chair- j
man of ths commission. The name !
of Mr. Jones will be presented to ,
the Senate early in the session and !
rumor has it that a determined fight
will be made on him. The tax commission
has recommended the passage
of an inheritance tax, , a sur- !
vey of the State, a strict enlorcement
of the income tax law and more
power for the Legislature, by constitutional
amendment, in fixing; taxes.
One of the most interesting1 reports
to be filed with the General
Assembly will be that of thel State
board of charities and corrections.
This board created at the last session
has done a wonderful work for
the benefit of the State's wards!. It
is certain that the board will b? continued
and liberally supported biy the
Legislature. The board has) already
justified its existence. The
ground work has been laid and, even
greater results will be obtaine/d in
the future..
Liquor Questions. j
Liquor has been a subject for discussion
in South Carolina for 25
years and again this year ijt will
cause some talk. The State [is now

The New Year celebrations all' \
over the country were held as usual <
and varied according to the locality 1
in which they were held. In New (
York the saloons were privileged to j
stay open two hours longer than i
usual and the gay throng on Broad- <
way celebrated in style. In Char- ]
leston the Hibernian Society held a s
public reception at their hall from ]
noon till two o'clock and every one i
who attended was treated to a dish ]
of hopping-John. This is an annual 1
dish at the Society's celebrations and ]
helps perpetuate the old time super- j
stition that any one eating hoppingJohn
on New Year will have good 1
luck. 1

Among tne ;\ew xear nonors conferred
by King George was that of
title of Baron on William Waldorf
Astor, the American, who has become
a citizen of the British Empire.
He has recently made large contributions
to the war fund.
A decree establishing a minimum
wage for the thousands of women
and girls employed in the retail
stores of the state of Massachusettes
went into effect with the New Year.
The minimum wage commission has
fixed $8.50 as a proper wage for experienced
employees.
Business Manager Gaston, of th$
Ford Peace commission, estimates
that the expenses of the commission
will go over a nflllion dollars. .
There is a movement on lo&t jot
Spartanburg to erect a moohment
to Robert Y. Hayne. A Citizenscommittee
of Spartanbure. -headed
by John B. Cleveland and H.JjJ. Ravenel
have asked the Spaj$anburg
delegation to favor an appropriation
for such a purpose. The delegation
is asked to secure an appropriation i
of not less than one thouc&nd five
hundred dollars. &5?fv _ '
The battleship South Carolina, is

According to the figures compiled
by the Tuskegee Institute and issued
recently, there were sixty-nine
Ivnchings by mobs in the United ?
States last year. There were fifty- :
five negroes and fourteen white men j
put to death in this manner, which
is six more negroes and eleven more j
whites than in 1914. Only fifteen ;
per cent of those put to death were
charged with assaults on women.

Legislature may be asked for a spe- <

written on. It wril be intereting *
to hear just what Gov. Maftping will J
have to say on this .subject. Law *
enforcement is dear to his heart&rid '
the enforcement of the prohibition
law will be o;ie of the hardest tasks r
before the chief executive. The s
Legislature will also have to decide c
on the disposition of the stocks held s
in the 15 counties, formerly having c
the dispensary system. - ^
Gov. Manning has been giving the c
question of rural credits serious con- *
sideration and his message will con- 1
tain some reference to this important c
subject. Just what kind of a law ?
will be proposed can not be predicted *
at ^his time. I
Gov. Manning will insist upon a *
continuance of the constructive pol- ?
icy with reference to the State Hos- c
pital for the Insane, where wonders 2
have been accomplished during the ?
past year. Several departments of t
the institution have been rebuilt and
the State is now dealing T*ith its in- ?
sane in a most kindly manner. The 1
Governor will ask the special appro- *
priation of $150,000 for the improve- *
ment of the building be continued. c
This request will meet with little ?
opposition, because the appropria- ?
tion for the same amount was so well 1
used last year. *
During the past week Gov. Man- ^
ning has been in conference with the t
State officials when their recommendations
were discussed. The military
department of the State is asking
for $69,000 to meet the demands.
Of this sum $25,000 will be used to
refund the federal government for
lost property. t
There is little prospect for wrangling
at the coming session.

it a time so close to the day fixed ei

jracticable to give it three readings C
n both houses. The prohibition bill o:
ilready passed by the house had ^

hree of those aligned with the Re- c'
'ornr faction voting against it. One *
>f these three was Dr .D. E. Finley, J

in congress. The new law 12
ncluded the essential principles of si
