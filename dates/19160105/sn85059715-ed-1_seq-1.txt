(Tills is the first of a scries of!
articles on national problems written
tor this paper by ex-Senator Burton,
of Ohio. This series is of particular;
Interest at this time for two reasons: I
first, because of Senator Burton's long |
and distinguished career in Congress; |
I secondly, because Mr. Burton is now
1 one of the leading candidates for the
, Republican nomination for president.
?The Editor.)
Ily Theodore E. Burton.
Through long association with the
problems of waterway development,
! the subject has commanded my deep
. attachment and most friendly Interest.
But conditions have changed and I
havo been forced to the conclusion
that certain forms of river and harbor
improvement are impracticable.
It has been the dream of my public!
career that the waterways of the
united states migni in uuio unumc
| the highways of a magnlticent comj
mercia! empire. The sight of an idle
I stream, on whose surface we might;
transport an enormous tonnage, appeals
strongly to the imagination,;
and suggests a highway furnished by
nature for all time as a protest
| against the expensive methods of
< land transportation. But this Idea,
i alluring as it Is. is forced to yield to
i moro practical Issucb when we apply
I to It the test of economic principles.
In considering the question of expending
the money of the taxpayers
of the country, we should at all times
be bound by those sane considerations
which dotermine the managers

Wilson conferred with Secretary
Lansing for an hour today over the
submarine crisis. No additional facts
beyond the definite knowledge that
only two Americans were aboard the
liner Persia had been received by the
state department overnight from either
Ambassador Penfield at Vienna,
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin or
American consular agents along the
shores of the Mediterranean. Such
information nB had already been received,
however, was carefully reviewed
by both the president and Mr. I
Lansing.
There was still every Indication I
that no action would be taken pend-|
Ing the receipt or further advices. 151-;
ther the status of the Persia was
changed from an unarmed liner to |
that of a vessel which might techni-!
cally be classified as armed by the 1
fact that it mounted ono gun, Is a
point which United States navy experts
will be .called upcrn to help determine.
Thnv will be asked for ad
vice on how the liner's one gun might
have been used. Meager despatches
have (ailed to Indicate whether the
gun waB mounted for defense or offense.

establish that only one American Is
among tho missing passengers? Robert
