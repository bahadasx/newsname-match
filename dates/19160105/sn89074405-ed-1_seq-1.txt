Majority Report Denounces
Roosevelt for Not Appear

SAY OFFICIALS
AIDED FOREIGNERS
Charges Were Circulated
During Last Term of Con
gress Says Report.
Washington, Jan. 5.—Charges circu
lated during tne last session ot con
gress that administration officials act
ed in the interest of foreign bUBinesB
firms in urging the passage of the gov
ernment ship purchase bill, are held
to be baseless in the majority and mi
nority reports, filed by the senate com
mittee appointed to investigate them.
Both reports also found the ship
ping Interests blameless of illegal ac
tivity in opposing the measure, the
majority denounced Theodore Roose
velt for falling to appear before th»
committee to testify concerning his
published assertion that President
Wilson and Secretary Bryan "had en
deavored in the Interest of certain for
eign business Arms to secure for the
United States the power to purchase
the interned ships of one of the belli
gerents."
The oharge, the report said, had its
origin "in that ungenerous trait of
the human mind which makes it
prone to attribute unworthy motives
to redoubtable rivals and particularly
political antagonists.
"The writer," added the report,
"whose eminence was naturally cal
culated to give weight to his utter
ances, finding himself without any
basis even of a hearsay character for
his slanderous attack, upon the high
est officer of his government, simply
resorted to a palpable sophistry to
escape the responsibility for the as
sertion he had made."
Defends Policy.
While the committee found no evi
dence to indicate that the president
or secretary harbored any purpose to
buy Interned ships, the majority held
that It was not difficult to conceive of
reasons consistent with the most •ex
alted motives that might Induce the
president to refrain from public de
claration that the belligerent ships
would noti*-'»«*olrt»t^~
"Siwh'an action." "aid the report,
"would -rightly be construed aa an
nation ha8 vlgofftiMfty maintained.'
-S They Score It.
Senator Sutherland presented the
minority report for himself and Sen
ator Penrose. "We do not concur,'
it said, "In so far as the report defends
the bill itself, nor In so far as it in
sists there would be no Impropriety In
the purchase of the belligerent idle
ships. We believe the bill a thor
oughly bad piece of legislation, and
are certain that to have purchased the
boats now seeking security In Ameri
can harbors would have developed
serious trouble for the United States."
No Passports Issued by Chi
nese to Country—Army
is Resisted.
I'cking, Jan. 5.—Bandits have he
come so active in Inner Mongolia and
have been so successful in resisting
the Chinese army that the government
now refuses to issue passports-for In
ner Mongolia and for much of China
proper lying near the Mongolian bor
der. Many robberies have been com
mitted near Kalgan and Dolon-nor.
Kalgan is less than one hundred miles
northwest of Peking, while Dolon-nor
is about 150 miles north of the Chi
nese capital.
China organized a Mongolian guard
of about 8,000 soldiers some time ago.
Practically alt this guard has desert
ed and taken its arms over to the
bandits. Loyal troops have been sent
from other parts of China within the
last month, and rumors have reached
Peking that their conflicts with the
bandits have been very disastrous to
the regular organisation. Reports are
constantly reaching Peking concern
ing the robbery of missionaries and
other foreigners in the Mongolian sec?
tion.
Captain Isaac Newell, U. & A., mili
tary attache of the Aitaarlcan legation,
and representatives of other legations
have recently been to Kalgan making
inquiries concerning the situation In
Inner Mongolia. Their Investigations
indicate that travel Is likely to be un
safe In Mongolia for "some time.
Travelers returning from the trou
bled section all say that the handKs
are unusually well provided with mod
ern arms and ammunition. Many of
the rifles used- by the outlaws are of
Japanese manufacture and praotloal
ly new.
Chinese newspapers mud fhlnsse
officials, charge the Japanese with
promoting the Mongolian disturbances
In support of their opposition to the

Manitoba Fund for Aid of
Soldiers' Families Se
verely Taxed.
Winnipeg, Man.. Jan. S.—Fifty
thousand dollars was expended each
month during the past year for the
aid and relief of families of soldiers,
the work being conducted through the
Manitoba patriotic fund, the statement
of the treasurer of that organisation
revealing the vast extent of operations
during the year Just eoncluded.
The statement shows that the exact
expenditures' in cash during the year
were f897,207.28, but In addition to
this, assistance In the form of sup
plies, milk, fuel, etc., was provided,
thus putting the total of aid at over
9600,000 in the year.
Since the commencement of the
second year of the war, contributions
to the fund from the city of-Winnipeg
alone have totalled 1186,259.16, while
the remainder of the province has
subscribed (34,408.13.
The ever Increasing financial de
mands on the patriotic fund are re
vealed by the fact that during Novem
ber and December, the disbursements
surpassed the receipts fcy IS,000.
The present condition Is giving the
officers of the fund considerable con
cern, and the prospects are that the
future will find even greater demands
on the fund. Because of this fact,
special appeals are being made for
donations.
Should peace be declared tomorrow,
fund officlals'say It would 'requtte the
surplus funds now available to care
for the families ot soldiers till their
return.
Vast sums are being expended

Jj^ING 0^ ONER RENEWS CRITICAL SITUATION WITH AUSTRIA
VA&.4UMK.
Once again American relations with Austria are strained, this time by
reason of the sinking of the liner Persia by a submarine and the consequent
loss of many lives, Including that of Robert McNeely, American consul at
Aden, Arabia. The sinking of the Persia without warning, just after Aus
tria had yielded to American demands in the Ancona case, makes the situ
ation all the more serious. Baron Zwledinek, representing Austria at
Washington, has asked the American people to suspend judgment until
after all the facts are known. Complete confidence prevails in Teutonic
diplomatic circles that If an Austrian submarine, sank the Persia without
warning the act would be disavowed promptly, reparation made for Ameri
can lives and the submarine commander severely punished.
Mr. McNeeley at the time of the disaster was on his way to his first
consular post. He was appointed to the Aden consulate in October. 1915.
He was born in Waxhau. N. C., Nov. 12, 1883, and his home was in Monroe,
N. C. He was a member of the North Carolina legislature from 1908 to
1910.

CARRY NO ARMS
WHILE OFF DUTY
Peking, Jan. 5.—-Officers command
ing the various legation guards have
agreed to prohibit their men'from
wearing side arma when on liberty.
This agreement is very gratifying to
the Chinese, officials, who have ex
pressed some apprehension as to what
would happen if members' of the va
rious belligerent guards clashed and
were able to use firearms.
On several occasions small groups
of soldiers from the legation guards
of warring countries had engaged In
street lights. They -have also had
skirmishes In moving picture shows
and other places of amusements.
The encounters between soldiers of
the belligerents have given rise to a
movement on the part of the Chinese
to have all the legation guards re
moved. This, however, has never been
seriously considered by the countries
having compounds in the legation
quarter.

PROTESTS
Compelled to go to New

at Own Expense.
New York, Jan. 5.—William Jen

terday against the law of New York
state, because he was required to
come here at his own expense and give
testimony in a suit for libel.
"I am here under duress," declared
Mr. Bryan, "because it is the only way
I can avoid contempt proceedings."
Mr. Bryan was examined In an ac
tion brought against a Greek newspa
per. He was questioned concerning
the sale by the United States to Greece
of the old battleships Idaho and Mis
sissippi, said he knew nothing of the
details. He denied that he gave any
secrets of gunfire control to the Greek
government, or that while secretary of
state he had seen any letter written to
influence him against Agamemnon
8chliemann, former Greek minister to
the United States. He also said he
had not heard criticisms alleged to
have been made of him by Schlie
mann.

Officials.
According to -Mr- Bryan, the sale of
the battleships was a matter which'
rested entirely with the navy depart,
ment. He admitted that gunfire con
trol secrets might have been divulged
by the navy department without his
knowledge or that "the state depart
ment might have attended to some de
tails of routine work without his per
sonal knowledge."
The suit is the outgrowth of a state
ment in the Greek newspaper, that the
plaintiff, Petros P. Tatanls, wrote or
caused. to be written a letter with a
view to bringing about 111 feeling be
tween Mr. Bryan and the former
Greek minister.

London, Jan. 5.—Under the terms of the com

of commons, all males between the ages of 18 and
41, who are bachelors or widowers without children
dependent upon them, are liable to military service,
Ireland excluded.
London, Jan. 5.—The bill providing for compul
sory military service, formally introduced in the house
of commons by Premier Asquith, precipitated one of
the most exciting and critical parliamentary fights in
the history of English government, certainly the most
critical since the beginning of the present war.

Figures of the Earl of Derby's stock
taking of the United Kingdom's mar

The publication of the figures finds
the cabinet crisis caused by compul
sion problem by no means ended. Ire
land, which is not included in the
Derby plan, also is said to be excluded
from the conscription measure which
Premier Asquith Introduces in the
House of Commons today. While
England is still debating the question
of compulsion. Ru&sia's great con
scription armies are making desperate
onslaughts upon the Austro-German's
before Czeracwitz, where, according to
Russian official reports, the Russians
not only repulsed Austrian counter at
tacks northeast of the city but are
themselves steadily advancing.
Biggest Assemblage.
The largest assembly of members
since the war began faced the pre
mier. Many members had obtained
leave to return from the front so thai
they might be able to vote on the
compulsion bill. The Earl of Derby,
who conductedHhe recruiting cam
paign, was in the peers' gallery. As
quith said in no caec has been mnd«
out for general compulsion, and thst
the bill he is introducing could be sup
ported by those opposed to conscrip
tion.
Asquith Opens Debate.
Asquith opened his address with an
analysis of figures in the Derby re
port. He emphasized the fact thsl
during the Derby campaign nearly 8,
000,000 men had offered their services.
Even deducting those rejected be

is still in excess of 2,600,000.

"They ought to convince both our al

men remain to bear arms.
But there are 650,000 unmarried
men who failed to come forward and
the government will now attempt to
