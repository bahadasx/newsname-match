\Hiile Hotel de Julius may not be the
*t popular of New Ulm hostelries,
it is quite generously patronized by
dents of the county and strangers in
midst. The place does not seem to
a favorite with the women folks as a
jpping place as only one of the gentler

ther chose to spend New Year's Day
he county jail. This year there were
who for similar reasons elected to
nain in their cells for the dawning of
New Year. In other words, there
re two more prisoners on hand in the
own County Bastile January 1st, 1916,
\n there were January 1st, 1915.
Phat the patronage of the place is
wing is shown by a comparison of the
orts of Sheriff Julius for 1914 and
5 for he entertained but 41 guests in
former
period and as stated above
*e were 108 during 1915. Whereas
two went to the larger correctional
ltutions of the state in 1914, there
3 six sentenced to the St. Cloud
rmatory and the state prison during
5. Sixteen served out their sentences
ng 1915 as compared with six in
1 and fines were collected from 37
last year as compared with 14 the
before. Four prisoners were ad
ed to bail, one of them being the
ile, which shows that she did not
any longer than she was obliged to
after she had registered. Four,
discharged when no indictment was
id against them and 25 were either
litted or their cases nolle prossed,
one prisoner was removed to the
pital for the insane. This leaves of
K, 108, nine who were prisoners from
otner counties or states who were taken
back to their respective home counties
for trial.
The male prisoners averaged nine days
iece in jail as there were 107 of them
the days board furnished amounted
63 for which the sheriff was paid at
rate of 60 cents per day for Brown
tnty, amounting to $540.60, and 71
for Sibley County prisoners, a
nting to $44.02, the latter being for
oners kept here at the time of the
age of location of the county seat
Henderson to Gaylord. The total
received by the sheriff for boarding
guests was $584.62. The bill for
I was $294.60.

NEW IMPLEMENT FIRM.
Messrs. Fesenmaier & Schilling To
Open New Establishment at
Springfield.
Robert Fesenmaier and Louis Schil
ling, both of this city, have formed
a co-partnership under the firm name of
the Springfield Implement company
and will open an implement house at
Springfield on February 1st. It is the
present intention of the new firm to
deal exclusively in farm machinery of
which they will carry a complete line.
Mr. Schilling has been employed at
the offices of the Hauenstein Brewing
Company for the past six years in the
capacity of bookkeeper. He will have
charge of the business at Springfield,
while Mr. Fesenmaier will contuine in
business at New Ulm as heretofore. Mr.
Schilling's position at the brewery has
as yet not been filled.
RECEIVES PATENT
TION.
ON INVEN-
Joseph Fesenmaier, of North State
Street, has become an inventor of House
hold articles and recently received letters
of patent upon a machine which is in
tended to alleviate the many tribulations
of the housewife, by saving time and dis
agreeable labor in the washing of pota
toes. The machine is very simple and,
according to those who have given it a
trial, works very satisfactorily, doing
the work in a remarkably short time,
washing a bushel of potatoes in less than
five minutes. While the machine pri
marily is intended forjuse in larger house
holds or hotels, smaller machines will
be manufactured for home use. Mr.
Fesenmaier has placed several of the
machines on the market, and intends to
begin the manufacture on a still larger
scale if his present plans materialize.
Several inquiries have been received by
him from manufacturers of household
novelties and the chances are that he
will sell his patent to one of these and
retain a royalty interest only.
Members of the Order of Eastern Star
and members of the Masonic fraternity
of this city enjoyed themselves at an
entertainment given at Masonic Hall
Sylvester night. About sixty were
present. The company entertained
themselves with cards and dancing and
there were several song numbers ren
dered. A fine luncheon was served by
the ladies which was thoroly appreciated
by all present.
The official opening of the Armory,
which had been planned to take place
on January 17, has been indefinitely
postponed on account of the .death of
Governor Hammond, the regulations
requiring official mourning for thirty
days.
2-v
Under a canopy hottfnHkethat upon le^SSTi
the memorable day when six years ago
Minnesota bowed her head in sorrow to
convey to its last resting place the re
mains of her first and only native born
governor at St. Peter, the last sad rites
were performed for the second governor
of the North Star State to die while
holding office, at St. James last Monday
afternoon, when the body of Governor
Winfield Scott Hammond was laid to
rest. That St. James and the State of
Minnesota loved and honored this man
who rose from obscurity to fame was
evident from the gathering of thousands
in the little country town. St. James,
with a population of hardly three
thousand, gathered within her precincts
more than twice that number last Mon
day. Special trains from the Twin
Cities, Mankato, Fairmont, New Ulm
and from the west on the Omaha line
brought an outpouring of visitors such
as the town had never witnessed before
and may never see again.
Town Dressed in Mourning.
And St. James was dressed in the som
bre black of mourning. Streamers of
black and white, with the Stars and
Stripes as a center-piece, were strung all
along the line of march of the funeral
procession, from the depot to the First
M. E. church, where the services were
held. Not a business block, not a home,
but what bore its silent message to the
world that therein dwelt those who
desired to show in this mute way their
remembrance of the man they had
honored and loved. All business was
suspended for the day in St. James, save
that which would tend to give relief from
the cold and damp and give nourishment
to the hungry.
New Ulm Contingent First.
The first special train to reach St.
James was from New Ulm, carrying the
local contingent sni those from the
neighboring towns. Winthrop, Fairfax,
Gibbon, Sleepy Eye, Springfield, San
born and New Ulm furnished approxi
mately 250 people. The consolidated
companies of the guard, Co. A and the
Machine Gun Company, and the Second
Regiment band, formed the military
section to participate at the obsequies,
while the Masonic Order was represented
by De Molay Commandery No. 26,
also several private citizens who joined
to pay their last respects to the dead
executive. Both the St. Peter and Man
kato Companies of the guard failed to
turn out, although they had been invited
so to do. The Masonic bodies of these
two cities turned out en masse, however,
the Knights Templar especially making
a strong showing.

the simple manner in which during his
life-time he had lived among them, and
the ceremonies as a consequence lacked
the gorgeous display of uniforms, with the
exception of those mentioned and the
members of the governor's staff, who
attended in full dress uniform. The
Presbyterian funeral service at the church
and the beautiful and impressive Masonic
rites at the grave were given with such
feeling and earnestness by Pastor Fisher
of the church and the Masters of the
lodge that none there were, but what felt
the solemnity of the occasion. Although
Governor Hammond had been a member
of the Presbyterian church of St. James
during his entire time of residence in
the town, the services were held in the
more pretentious edifice of the First M.
E. Congregation across the street.
Thither the body was borne from the
train through a solid phalanx of people
who had massed upon the side walk along
the entire line of march. There the
casket was opened for the last time to
give the home folks an opportunity to
take one last glimpse of all that was
mortal of Townsman Hammond. There
in bursts of eloquence speakers passed
in review the life of their distinguished
fellow-citizen. There, half-hidden a
mong the many floral offerings sent from
far and near, sat state officials, present
and past there stood with heads bowed
in prayer the clergy of the churches of
St. James, irrespective of political faith
of the former and regardless of creed of
the latter. All bent to do homage to the
dead.
Rev. Harry W. Fisher, pastor of the
Presbyterian Church of St. James, de
livered the funeral sermon, speaking
from the text: "Howl, fir tree, for the
cedar has fallen," Zechariah, 11, 2, in
part, as follows:
"When the smaller specimens of the
woodland fall but little excitement is
occasioned among the sylvan inhabi
tants. The grouse does not even stir
from her place where her young are
feeding, nor does the fox more than
raise his head and foot in a listening
attitude. But when the "cedar" (the
glory of the Oriental forest) that has
been standing for ages, a blessing to the
forest creation, and a pride and beauty
to the eye of man, becomes decayed, or
under the swoop of a cyclone, weighs its
anchorage of root and falls, the crash
resounds throughout the country it
startles the eagle from its aerie and sends
the stag in terror from his position over
looking the valley, and seems to even
shake the very foundations of moun
tains.
"Just a few hours ago, the fierce,
swarthy, axman effectually wrought in
the forest of humanity. He had hewn
U535
down many a tall and gigantic timber for
six thousand years he has been swinging
bis ax and through experience he has
great SKHI.
His attack this time has been on one
whom we all know and love. Right in
our own door yard, he sent stroke after
stroke until the cedar which has stood
the blasts of trouble and trial, of toil and
Abuse, finally dropped to the earth and
the nation resounded ^mth the crash.
The trees on which we lean and under
whose protection we basked, is gone!
'Howl, fir tree, for the cedar has fallen'.
"Governor Hammond is dead The
merchant drops his yard stick, the
laborer his shovel, the author his pen and
the student his books the world looks
on in amazement and sorrow.
"Taking it all in all, I think it is the
saddest death of any public man in our
day.
"We are assembled here this after
noon with our hearts and faces sad and
our souls burdened, let neither tongue
nor pen by ourselves review or un
worthy criticism add one drop to our
cup of grief, it is overflowing already.
Be it ours to learn the lessons of fortitude,
perseverance, ever of Christian en
durance, of this man, living and dead.
"America has produced many men who
were great in every sense of the word,
each state has her share in contributing
that which has made our country and
government the greatest of the earth.
The North Star state has added her
quota, but in my opinion no section has
produced a greater man for the govern
ment than was our friend and fellow
citizen, who has fallen from our midst
while so excellently serving his state as
her chief executive.
"The great empire of the north, Min
nesota, has been greatly aided in at
taining to her proper place of prominence
among her sisters by the life whose de
parture this afternoon we mourn. While
we are assembled here on this mission of
sadness at this hour, the eyes of America
are turned toward us. Minnesota is
bowed in heart-broken sorrow, and each

A real estate deal was consummated
last Friday, whereby Fred Seiter be
comes the proprietor of the Merchants
Hotel, corner Minnesota and First
South streets, owned by Chas. Stuebe,
Sr., and occupied under lease at present
by Andreas Amann.
Mr. Seiter informs the Review that
he purchased the property solely as an
investment and has no intentions of
disturbing the present tenant, whose
lease still has another year to run.
Should Mr. Amann decide, however,
to terminate the lease before its expiration
Mr. Seiter will no doubt take charge of
the property and opearte the hotel him
self.
The Merchants corner is one of the
most desirable in the city, the vacant
property on First South being large
enough to take care of any improvements
which might become necessary as the
city grows and transient trade increases.
QUIET GREETING TO NINETEEN
SIXTEEN.
The passing of the old year and the
welcoming of the new was observed
rather quietly compared with the noisy
celebrations of former years. At the
stroke of 12 the mill whistles were
sounded and the church bells rung and
a few stray shots fired by some of the
more noisily inclined.
At the several dance halls of the city
the young folk as well as some of the old
enjoyed themselves by tripping the light
fantastic until a late hour. At Turner
Hall, where the firemen held forth at
their annual ball, a large crowd gathered
and it was not until 4 a. m. that the last
began to wend their way homeward.
The Gem and Armory dances were also
well attended.
CHANGES CONTEMPLATED.
The Friedens Church held their an
nual meeting Monday and elected their
trustees. Two members of the Board,
C. H. Hamann and Wm. Radtke were
re-elected and Albert Spaeth is the new
member. The treasurer's report shows
that the church finances are in good con
dition. The matter of enlarging the
church building was discussed at some
length and plans were shown by Mr.
Stegggmann. The idea is to put a base
ment under a part of the present building
and later to erect an addition about 18
by 38 feet. The basement would then
be fitted up with coal cellars, kitchen
and other needed rooms. ~No definite
action was taken in the matter as that
will be done "at a future meeting if the
idea meets with favor.

FORMER CITIZEN OF NEW ULM:
INSTANTLY KILLED IN COL
LISION.
DR. VOGEL'S GREEN CAR GETS
HIM TO SAFETY BUT LOSES
ITS LIFE.
Two automobile accidents of the week
in which a present and a former citizen
of New Ulm played the principal roles
ended in death for one of them and a.
most miraculous escape from any injury
whatever for the other. In the accident
in which Death took a hand, Otto
Kluegel of St. Paul was instantly killed
and in the other Dr. J. P. Vogel found
himself standing unhurt beside the ruins
of his green "hurry-up" car after it had
attempted to resist the attack of the
Hughes flyer at a crossing five miles from
home.
In a head end collision between a
street car and his motor car Otto E.
Kluegel, a former resident of New Ulm,
was crushed between the car and the
automobile and instantly killed. Mr.
and Mrs. Patrick Farrell who were with
Mr. Kluegel at the time of the accident
were thrown out of the midline and
seriously injured. Mr. Farrell suffered
a broken leg. With her nose broken,,
several teeth knocked out and her scalp,
so badly bruised that no examination
of her skull could be made, Mrs. Farrell
is hardly expected to pull thru. She is
lying unconscious in the Bethesda
Hospital in St. Paul.
The accident happened Sunday morn
ing about two o'clock at University
Avenue and Dunlap Street on the
Minneapolis-St. Paul line. The three
victims were east bound on University
Avenue and drove directly into the
approaching car, according to the story of
Harj^ Jahren, motorman. He saw the
the tracks headed toward his 1
.. believed that th*y would turn
out. The automobile was coming fast
and instead of turning out smashed
squarely into the front end of the car.
Kluegel was driving the automobile at
the time of the accident.
Mr. Kluegel was a son-in-law of Mrs.
Christiana Albrecht and a brother of
Mrs. Ben Vetter who lives on North
Jefferson Street. He was a man about
42 years old. He was born in Saxony,
Germany and came to this country with
his parents when a mere lad. The
family came to New Ulm and the de
ceased lived here for quite a number of
years. He learned the carpenter trade
and was engaged as such until he removed
to St. Paul eight years ago where he
opened a hardware store which proved a
very successful business venture. In
October, 1898, the was married here in
New Ulm to Pauline Albrecht who,
with five sons and one daughter mourn
his untimely death. The youngest child
is only 9 months old. The deceased is
also survived by his parents and a brother
George who resides at Lamberton. The
funeral was held from his late residences
in St. Paul yesterday (Tuesday) after
noon at 1:30 o'clock. From here Mr..
and Mrs. Ben Vetter, Robert Albrecht
and Charles Kuehlbach attended the
funeral. Herman Albrecht of Essig and
Gustav Albrecht of Fairfax also attended. $£.,
the funeral.
Dr. Vogel was returning from a pro
fessional visit near Courtland about four
o'clock Sunday afternoon. The cold
weather and a habit of speeding peculiar: J2
to the green car, led the Doctor to eat ur^
the home trail in regular 8:45 time and
while he was making the most of a clean
track ahead of him he became suddenly
aware that some thing else was in a
hurry, namely the Hughes "Flyer" on
its afternoon trip. Had the paths of the
Flyer and the auto paralleled each other
nothing more exciting than a race be
tween the iron steed and the gas buggy
might have occurred but the situation
was not quite so simple. When the
Doctor spied the Flyer it was approach
ing a crossing he had intended to make
use of himself, and at a speed which
would indicate their simultaneous* ar
rival upon the spot. The Doctor meas
ured the 30 feet between his car
and the crossing, recalled a table given
in last week's Review as to the distance
necessary to stop a moving car, at
various speeds, and decided said 30 feet
was all too inadequate. One thing re
mained to be done, to beat the Flyer to it
and gallantly the green car leaped to the
trail and made it, almost, but not quite.
The engine caught the tail of the car,
just where the spare tires are slujn
Catching the car thus, the force of
