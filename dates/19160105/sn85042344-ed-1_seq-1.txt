Persia may have on the negotiations between the United States and
foreign powers with regard to their prosecution of submarine war
ware on the shipping of belligerent enemy powers.
The only developments today were the marked indications of
the president's intention to proceed carefully and deliberately be
fore committing the United States to the next step in its already
Strained relations with the central powers.

soon as the full facts in the Persia disaster can be learned.
"The presidenl and the secretary of state are taking every
ana Dossible to obtain the full facts in this grave matter and will
act just as soon as the informal ion is obtained, said
