SCHOOL RULE 45 j
UPSET BY COURT,
I
Dismissal of Woman Teacher
Because of Marriage Held
Unreasonable.
AUTHORIZES MANDAMUS
TO COMPEL RESTORATION
-?
Justice Gould Sustains Contention
of Mrs. Hellmann Against District
Board of Education.
Hule 4.? of the board of education,
which operates automatically to vacate
the position in the public schools of a
female teacher who marries, was held
unreasonable today in an opinion by
Just;ce Gould of the District Supreme
Court The court directed the issuance
of a mandamus against the board
to compel the reinstatement of Mrs.
Gladys Aline Strong Hellrnann to a
teaehership in the schools. To refer
to the rule as unreasonable is "to gently
characterize it," the justice says.
The court finds that the letter which
Mrs. Hellmann wrote to the board after
her marriage, and which was construed
by the school authorities to be
n resignation, cannot be made to bear
that construction. "On the contrary,"
says Justice Gould, "it is an argument,
pud an exceedingly able and convincing
argument, demonstrating the unreasonableness
of the rule."
Discusses Board's Powers.
The board of education. Justice
Gould holds, cannot prescribe by its
by-laws a mode of dismissal inconsistent
with a mode indicated by a
cini-P
tittiuic-*ail? IIIUIC inaii ?. V.V ??
the passage of the law specifically prescribing
what pay shall be given the
substitute teachers, pass a by-law prescribing
a different method of dealing
with that subject. Whatever would be
its power in the absence of the express
provisions in the statute, when the
statute speaks on a subject the board's
power to pass by-laws on the same subject
is necessarily curtailed.
Miss Strong was graduated at the
Normal School in June, 1910, and during
the following year was appointed a
teacher, which position she held until
June, 1914. July 15, 1914, she was
married, and. knowing of rule 45. she
wrote the board requesting that its
provisions be not enforced in her case
and presenting arguments against the
validity of the rule. The letter was
referred to the committee on elementary
schools and to the superintendent.
The superintendent seems never to
have reported upon it, but the committee
reported that it regretted it was
unable to comply with the wish of
Mrs. Hellmann in view of rule 45. The
board thereupon referred the communik
cation to the committee on rules, whfeh
reported that her communication
should be denied, and that rule 45
should not be amended, which report
was approved by the board.
Qualifications Not Questioned.
Tn his opinion Justice Gould points
otr that no qv tstion is made by the
board of educr Ion that Mrs. Hellmann
still possesses all the academic and
pedagogic qv lificaiions to teach. Tt
is also admi Led, he states, that the
board of education in general has the
power to snake reasonable rules relat- j
ing to the schools. From the opinion I
o* the i'ourt of Appeals in the Dean
I *: !
f asp. xnis pnwcr, jubuvb uu^m nu?uo,
1? limited to such rules and regulations
as are reasonable.
The court says:
Testing the reasonableness of the
ru'?* in question by its consistency
with the general policy of the board
with regard to the employment of married
women as teachers, it is apparent
from the answer of respondent that its ?
policy has been, and is, to employ and
retain married women as well as unmarried
women as teachers.
Quotation From Answer.
"In its ansv-er the board savs:
" "Married and unmarried men and
women are now, and have been for
many years, employed as teachers in
the public school system of the Distort
of Columbia; that there is nothing
in the rules or regulations adopted by
the board of education which precludes
a married woman or married man from
taking the examination, at any time, to
determine his or her fltn'ess to teach
in the public schools, and they have
be*-n upon the same footing, in that
respect, as unmarried men and women.'
This statement in the answer pref '
jdes the necessity of any discussion
of the relative efficiency of married
n? d unmarried w omen. The board has
determined that married women are as
eligible to teach as the unmarried. In
other words, marriage, or the state of
being married, on the part of a woman.
has been determined by the board
to be no bar. If Mrs. Hellmann had
married before she was appointed a
teacher, under the admitted policy o<
th?- board, her marriage would not
have disqualified her to teach. But
i ?]r?r rule 45. having married after
having heen appointed a teacher, she
becomes thereby disqualified.
'The answer of the board also contains
this statement: 'That respondents
know of no regulation which
would prevent the relator from taking
auch examination, and. if found qualified.
from being reappointed upon the
staff of teachers.' Taking this in connection
with the other admission in
the answer, that the relator 'possessed
and .-till possesses all of the pedagogic
u qualifications," the board apparently
?ays to the relator: 'Von were qualifb
'l. you married and thus forfeited
>our position under rule 45. you are !
*t?J! qualified and may be reinstated j
ui?o? takinir an examination.
"Or the situation may fairly he stated
a> follow? July 14 the relator, then Mis?
Strong. was a teacher possessing all of
the academic and pedagogic qualifications
to teach; July l."i. 1914. she married,
under rule 4."? her plate as teacher
thereby l>ecaine vacant; July 1?> she
could be reappointed upon taking an examination.
which must necessarily have
>*sen a mere formality, as the answer of
th?? board admits 'her academic and pedago
g!r qualifications' both before and
after her marriage.
Points Out "Unreasonable" Phases.
"In other words, if this rule is valid, the
mere act of going through a marriage
ceremony deprives a female teacher of
her position, although equally qualified
before and after the act. ami although
married women are, by the policy of the
b^ard. subject, to no disqualification by
reason of their coverture. A rule which,
when applied, leads to such a result is
gently characterized v/hen calfed unreasonable."
The contention of relator that rule 4S
is invalid because it conflicts with the organic
law wherein the mode of removal of
a teacher in the public schools is specified
is also well founded, the opinfon declares.

SENATE MAY PROBE~
RISE OF GASOLINE
Calls on Interior Department
for All Information
at Hand.
BASIS OF INVESTIGATION,
MR. McCUMBER SUGGESTS
Two Resolutions Presented in the
House Ask Attorney General if
Any Have Been Prosecuted.
" .. . I
k ongress today took official
cognizance of the recent jumps
in the price of gasoline in the face
of increased production, larger
reserve supplies and fewer exports
than evtr before, when the
Senate adopted the resolution of
Senator McCumber of Xorth
Dakota, calling upon the Interior
Department for all the information
in its possession regarding
the matter.
In a brief address. Senator
McCumber suggested that the information
obtained might be
made the basis of an investigation.
Two resolutions were introduced in the
House on the subject, one which went to
the judiciary committee calling- on the
Attorney General to report to tne House
whether there have been any prosecutions
among gasoline producers for violation of
the anti-trust laws, and the other to the
interstate and foreign commerce commission
to make an investigation of the recent
rise.
The Fuller Resolution.
The resolution introduced by Representative
Fuller of Illinois states:
"In order to raise the necessary revenues
for the support of the govern
- "vv" r* v|/wtjvu, uiiiuii6 Ullltl
things, to levy a tax on gasoline.
"The producers of that article of universal
use have evidently been encouraged
by such proposal to believe that
an opportunity to levy tribute for their
own personal benefit had been overlooked.
and have in consequence more
than doubled the price to the consumer."
It is provided: "That the committee
on interstate and foreign commerce be
authorized and instructed to investigate
the cause of the sudden and unprecedented
rise in the price of gasoline
and to inquire and ascertain
whether any conspiracy exists and
whether any law of the United States
Ivs been violated by any one in connection
with such matter, and" to report
to the House its findings and conclusions
at an early date."
#Asks Economic Season.
The bill by Representative Steenerson
of Minnesota, which went to the
judiciary committee, declares:
"The wholesale and retail prices of
petroleum and its products, and especially
gasoline, have during the last
six months greatly increased in the
United States:
"There appears to be no sufficient
natural or economic cause for such increase:
*It is alleged that the increase is due
to combinations and conspiracies between
persons and corporations en- 1
gaged in the wholesale and retail trade .
in these commodities among the sev- 1
eral states and between the United :
States and foreign nations, in viola- '
tion of the act to protect trade and 1
commerce against unlawful restraint
and monopolies. !
"By reason of such combinations and
conspiracies the price of petroleum
and its products", and especially gaso- 1
line, has been increased to the con- '
suniftr in the United States to such an '
extent as to be unreasonable and ex
luruonary.
Will Depress Industries.
"This extortionate price, if maintained
in the future, will depress the J
industries of the United States, and
especially agriculture." The resolution
provides:
^-CThat the Attorney General of the
United States he. and he is hereby, re- ;
quested to inform the House? ;
"First. Whether or riot any prosecutions
have been instituted in any of the
courts of the United States for the purpose
of punishing as crimes and misdemeanors
any such alleged violations
of the anti-trust laws of the United
States, and
Second. If no such prosecutions have |
been instituted, what reason exists for
not instituting the same and enforcing
said anti-trust laws against such al- '
leged combinations and conspiracies in
restraint of trade and commerce."
By Federal Trade Body.
Investigation of the rise in the price
of gasoline will be left to the federal
trade commission and not undertaken ,
at the present time by the Department
of Justice.
Officials pointed out today that the .
Department of Justice has no such
facilities as the trade commission, nor
has it power to examine witnesses under
oath unless it has brought suit.
The trade commission has such power,
and since it already has an investigation
under way. attorneys for the De- j
partrnent of Justice decided to abandon
their plans for a separate inquiry. j
If the commission develops violations
of law the prosecution would be under
taken by the Department of Justice. ,

B. & 0. TURNS DOWN
OFFER OF $1143,443
Plaza Commission's Price Is
Thought Too Low by Railway
Officials.
HOLD OUT FOR VALUATION
THE PRESIDENT REJECTED
Amount Fixed by Former Condemnation
Body $585,556.46 Greater
Than Second Award.
I lie commission ot awards 101
the proposed extension of I'liion
Station plaza lias offered S 1,143.443.54
to tlie Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad Company for its property
holdings in the area involved
in the extension. The offer has
been declined.
The amount offered represents
the aggregate prices paid by the
railway company for the various
parcels of realty, plus 6 per cent
interest thereon. This is the
maximum that the commission
was allowed to offer under the
conditions of the joint resolution
of Congress under which the
commission is authorized to acquire
the properties involved in
the proposed extension.
Property May Be Worth More.
That the price offered is the maximum
allowed by the resolution appears
to indicate that the commission
has found the fair valuation of the
property at least as large as the maximum
fixed, or larger. No inforfnation
as to the estimated fair valuation is
obtainable from any source. It is, however.
known that the commission made
such a valuation with the? object of
determining whether the offer should
be less or should be more than the
maximum.
The attitude of the railway company
seems to be to "stand pat" on the
valuation fixed by the former condemnation
commission, whose findings
were rejected by the President, with
the result of the appointment of the
present commission. The valuation by
the former commission was $1,7-9.000,
so that the railway company would
stand to lose $585,556.46 by acceptance
of the present offer.
The fair values on other holdings
fixed by the commission of awards approximated
a reduction of about 4 per
cent from the awards of the former
condemnation commission. Had the
same ratio of reduction been applied
to the properties of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Company, the reduced
price would have amounted to $1,649,$40,
$79,160 less than the old valuation,
as compared with more than a half
million dollars. There was reason to
believe, it is said by persons familiar
with the situation, that the railroad
.v,u?(, "Hifrfjiian ofFer of a
valuation at the same ratio of reduction
as made to other property owners,
accepting the loss of less than a hundred
thousand dollars rather than continue
an issue that is costly.
President to Get Findings.
The commission will submit its findings
to the President, who is required by the
joint resolution to approve thern. As the
finding is not accompanied by an acceptance,
it has not the general status of
ihe other awards made, but the President
may announce it as an award.
The Baltimore and Ohio railroad, it is
stated on excellent authority, will resist
the taking over of its property at the
value fixed. The courts will be invoked,
if necessary, to enjoin any seizure of the
property on further condemnation proceedings,
on the score that Congress has
no power to fix the price at which it will
acquire land, regardless of its value, it is
also said, and reliance will likely be
placed in the condemnation award of
the former condemnation commission.
it is likely to be contended, it is
stated, that the terms of the resolution
violate the property rights of the owners
of the properties that t-he government
wishes to acquire, as far as tVie
price fixed can be regarded as mandatory
of acceptance by the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Company. There is
also a nice point of law, which is likely
to tie availed of. it is suggested, as to
whether or not tho old award does not
stand as a court order, not revoked and
unrevokable, for the awards made by
the former condemnation commission
were hied with the court with the approval
of the Attorney General. The
President's interference alone interrupted
completion of the transaction.
Hamilton. Yerkes & Hamilton are
counsel for the railroad corporation.
Mrs. Spencer Rejects Award.
Only one other property holder in all
the area involved in ihe proposed extension
has refused acceptance of the
award made by the commission of
awards. Mrs. Mary Spencer has declined
to accept about 5100.000 offered
her for her holdings on Massachusetts
avenue northeast, in square 7L'3. There
are two or three other acceptances of
awards whete the titles have not yet
been proven and acquired by the gov
ernment. utnerwi.se me commission s
work is done, save its final report to
the President.
Having practically disposed of all its
affairs, the coriuniss'on iv expected to adjourn
probably within a week or ten days,
subject to the call of tne President
for the official completion of its work
The commission is understood to he
now preparing its report to the President,
reciting all its official acts.
This report will probably show the
properties acquired and those which
the commission has been unable to acquire
in the plaza area. It is expected
that the report will also show the expenditures
of the commission for saiiries
of the commissioners, employment
of clerks and general expenses.

Senator Gallinger today introduced in
the Senate a bill designed to prohibit

"diploma factories" in the District of \
Columbia. The bill provides for amend- i
ing the "institutions of learning" sub- j
chapter oT the general incorporation i
law. j
It is substantially the same as the |
bill introduced at the Sixty-third Con- J
gress as bill 3431, with the exception
that an addition providing for the exchange
of professors and students by
universities in this and foreign countries
has been made. The bill is one
introduced by Senator Gallinger at the
I instigation of the committee on uniI
versities of the Washington Board of
I Trade. It is to the following effect :
Provisions of the Bill.
It defines 'institution of learning" I

CONSUL M'HEELY'S
i DEATH UP IN SENATE

Mr. O'Gorman Says He Disregarded
Advice to Sail for

CRISIS OVER SUBMARINES
SUBJECT OF CONFERENCE
President and Secretary Lansing
Await Fuller Reports From
U. S. Representatives.
That American Consul K. X. i
McXeely. believed to have lost!
his life in the Milking of the j
llritish steamer Persia, disre)
garded urgent advice of Aineri[
can Consul < ieneral Skinner at [
London to proceed t>> hi-- post at'
Aden on a Dutch vessel. vva>;
stated to the Senate today by (
Senator O'l lornian of Xevv York. j
The statement was made in a!
brief flurry of discussion ov er the
international situation injected \
when Senator Jones of Washing-'
ton read an editorial from a i
morning newspaper urging American
citizens to keep ofl' belligerent
ships and thus aid in reduc-1
ing the embarrassments of the
L'nited States.
Urges President to Be Careful.
Commenting on the editorial. Senator
Jones beseeehed President Wilson "to
be careful, proceed slowly and keep in j
view the interests of 99,95*9,000 of'
American citizens, rather than the l.ooo
reckless, inconsiderate, unpatriotic citi- |
zens who insist on traveling on hellig- |
erent ship:?, and that he not lead us I
humiliation."
"Does the senator mean t<> infer that .
American Consul McNeely, who was I
on the Persia, was unpatriotic?" asked '
Senator Nelson of Minnesota.
"1 think that it would have been
much better if Consul McNeely had 1
hunted out an entirely neutral ship for \
his voyage rather than embarking on
a belligerent," Senator" Jones re- i
sponded.
Suggests Cfficial? Go by U. S. Ships.
Senator Owen suggested that Ameri- i
can officials in these times should be i
sent to their posts on American ships
under protection of the American flag.
"No one can deny the misfortune that
came to American Consul McNeely,"
replied Senator O'dorman, "if it proves
true that he lost his life on the Persia,
but it was not necessary for him to
have been sent on an American snip to
his post."
"There was a neutral ship which was
ready to sail and carry him safely to
Aden. He was advised by one of our
consular representatives long in the j
service, Mr. Skinner, who accompanied i
him from New York to Kngland, that
he had better continue his journey to
Aden on a Dutch vessel that was ready
