best I could, although I have had many
trills. I want you all to pray for me.
I intend to live a better life the remain
der of my days, whether they are many
or few."
Then in about five minutes after he
was seated he told his wife he had a
severe pain in the back of his head and
went out of the church, took a seat on
the steps, and told his wife and those who
gathered around him that he was
"better now" and closed his eyes in
death, his spirit took its flight, where
he heard said: "Well done, thou good
and faithful servant. Thou has been
faithful over a few things, I will make
thee ruler over many."
He had lived a Christian since child
