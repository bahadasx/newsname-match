SPLENDID ACHIEVEMENTS OF DUING YEAR I
With silver at bedrock price for
several months, a price that would not
have enabled the mines of Tonopah
to continue at a profit If It were not
for the gold content of the quartz,
Tonopah concluded the year with a
most excellent showing. Its produc
tion in 1915 was 6:16,128 dry tons,
worth $11,074,922, slightly over the
estimate made by the Bonanza early
In the year.
To evidence that the appreciation
In the price of the metal after the
great slump, and the gold content of
the ore, made mining profitable, it Is
only necessary to state that the fol
lowing dividends were paid during the
twelve months: Jim Dutler Tonopah,

SAN FRANCISCO .Jan. 5. The eruption of Fanualei, a long
dormant volcanic Island of the Friendly group, 2500 miles south-
east of Honolulu, is reported by steamer captains as again active.
They said they saw the volcano sending up' smoke, ashes and pum-
ice. This explains recent conditions reported by mariners that the
Pacific ocean was filled with floating pumice which made navlga-
tion very difficult.

HARBIN, Jan. 5. Three German
prisoners, disguised as Chinese, were
arrested recently on a Trans-Siberian
train at Tsltslkar, 200 miles west of
Harbin.
The conductor saw one of the men
looking out of a window In the corn
dor of one of the coaches, while the
train was crossing a large bridge over
Nonna river. When questioned, the
man in Chinese garb, refused to talk.
The conductor pulled off the passen-1
ger's cap and cue and discovered that
the man had brown hair and had
stained his skin the color of a Chinese.
A search through the train result
ed in the discovery of three other
passengers similarly llHguised. All
of the men were detained at Tsltsl
kar. A heavy guard has been placed over
all the bridges on the Trans-Siberian
line. So many attempts nave Been
made upon bridges since the begin
ning of the war thut special squads
now board afl trains and examine the
passengers before a train Is permitted
to cross a bridge.

Many betterments have been made
in the mills and their output Increased,
while the extraction Is now closer than
ever before. One pleasing feature of
the developments is that the greater
depth attained in all the properties
during the year has not given to the
ores any base qualities, making ex
traction more difficult and expensive,
but, If any change has taken place,
It is to Improve the gold ratio.
