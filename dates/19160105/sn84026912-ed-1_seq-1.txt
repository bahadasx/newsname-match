QCOI?CC county, being in like ex
treme northern cotton belt and con
taining some rolling land too steep to
cultivate profitably, is favorably sit
uated for live stock, especially when
we consider the co-operative creamery
so near and the beef cattle markets
established in different parts of tho
State.
It ls genorally conceded that three
things are necessary In making the
live stock industry profitable, namely:
Good stock, homo raised feed and pro
per attention (not necessarily expen
sive buildings). It ls generally more
profitable to market surplus feed
through cattle, returning tho manure
to the land, than to sell the feed.
Good pasturage ls ono of the re
quirements of a permanent, profitable
live Btock industry. One man says:
"The average pasture consists of I
three loosely stretched barbed wires
around the head of a branch, taking
in the neighboring hillsides and gul
llos, growing briars and old-field
pines-a fine place to have a good
animal starve." To bo sure, the
waste la/id should be put to pas
tures, but trees and good grass do
not grow In the same place. The
trees should be cut and the land put

MR. V?m> TALKS i>V .I'EACK
On Ret?m to Amcrien-^'The'^
Resans!bio for War." \
New Ypfc-k. Jah< .2*-Henry Ford,
who led the ?peace'^exj^ltlon^ whioh
lett here December 4 on the steamer
Oscar II for Copenhagen lu the hope |
of bringing about a conference of
neutral nations thai would end the
.war, arrived hore, to-day on tho
steamship; BorgonsfJord, He con
firmed cable reports that his return
had been has tened-by, illness, but said
he intended' when h? left to come
back this month.
Mr. Ford declared his vlov/s re-i
garding the cause of the wai* haye
undergone a marked chango. When'
he left he said ho was of the opinion
that, bankers and manufacturers of
munitions and armament were re
sponsible, b?t he returns with the,b$;
lief that it ia tho people themselves,
those being slaughtered, who are re
sponsible. The men doing the fight
ing haye been too content to let''those
who rule them do their thinking, and
I they have not taken advantage of
their divine right to say for them-'
pelves what they shall dp^ ana> think,
the pacificist asserted.
"Republics are no better t lian mon
archies In this respect," he said.
"Even In the United States we let
those whom we have elected to office
bo swerved from their duty. We do |
not assert ourselves. Personally, I
have been a voter 31 years, and in all
that time I have voted only six times,
and then because my wife made me."
Relieves Mission Will Succeed?
Of the eventual success of . the
peace mission Mr. Ford declared he
had no doubt. "The movement is
now organized and under way?" hp
said. "People are talking absout ')t?
and, while some criticise when people
talk, they think, and when,they ihInk
they think right." , '
Mr. Ford's future plans with re
spect to the peace expedition were
uncertain, he said. He left the party
in chargo of Gaston 'Plantlff, he stat
ed? in accordance with his original
plans, and, despite all reports to the
countrary, when tho party left the
Oscar II, it was as harmonious ag.
could bo desired.
"The main Idea of the mission,"
con tinned Mr, Ford, "was to crystal
lize Into concrete form, If possible,,
tho various ideas and hopes for peace
which prevail all over the world. The
nations doing the fighting would be.
glad to stop If they could, 1 believe,
but they are afraid to let go,
"Those who accompanied me on
the Oscar ll were as fine a body?ojp,
people.fprjHiat particular, mission as
I could ask," And, Hie interested dole*,
gates that met us at-.Christiana were
all good men. I am simply financing
and carrying out as far as possible,
the work set underway last year at
I the meeting'nt The-Hague'of .the -Wo?
I men's International Peace Congress'.
This work ultimately will bring Hu
rope to Its 3enses and stop the way.
I "If what I have done, will, bring'
peace only one. day'nenreh I ?hall be
more than repaid. Every, day the
var ls shortened wlH save 30,000
.lives, and 30,000/lives will moan

Commenting on thejpreparedn?BS

Mr. Ford said: ?
