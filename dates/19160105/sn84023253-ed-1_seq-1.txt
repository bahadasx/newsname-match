BREACH 0FPR0MISE
Suit of Agnes McGovern vs. Ed
ward Riley . Starts Today
Horse Case Being Finished
The case of Agnes McGovern vs. Ed
ward Riley is expected to be com
menced In Caledonia county court to
day. This, as is generally known, is
a case in, which the plaintiff seeks
damages for an alleged breach of
promise. It was expected the case
would be started yesterday afternoon
and the parties were called here to be
ready, but the case on trial was not
finished.
This case is Martin D. Turner vs.
D. J. Howard, in which the value of
a horse is at stake. The plaintiff al
leges that he sold the defendant one
horse and bought one from the de
fendant which was not as represented.
The defence is that they exchanged
horses and the horse delivered de
fendant was not what it was represent
ed to be. A large number of witnes
ses were called to testify In the case.
An interesting feautre at the open
ing of the case was the illness of J.
Rolf Searles who was to appear for
the plaintiff. After consultation Ar
thur Graves, the Junior member of
the firm of Simonds, Searles and
Graves consented to start the case and
conducted it alone Monday afternoon.
Mr. Simonds who was in Rutland on
business connected with the Industrial
Accident Board was notified and came
home Monday night. Porter, Witters
and Harvey appear for the defence.
Mr. Searles is still confined to his
house, suffering with pleurisy.

Lecture Tuesday At Museum.
The next lecture in the Museum
course on "Problems of Everyday
Living," will occur on Tuesday, Jan.
11, at 4:15 p. m. at the Fairbanks
Museum. The subject will be the
"Waste Problem." Most Important
for consideration in a practical way
Is the maintenance of rhythm in all
the vital activities. Waste material
in the body causes much ill health
and lack of efficiency. The mechan
ism of the lungs, kidney and skin for
the harmonious control of vital pro
cesses is most beautiful.

It was a happy New year's gather
ing at the ' Woman's club house on
Saturday afternoon when member
and friends of the association extend
ed greetings of the season and burned
the mortgage given four and a half
years ago to pay for the club house.
Mrs. George H. Cross, president of the
association, and Mrs. Rebecca P
Fairbanks received the guests and re
freshments of coffee and sandwiches
were served to them in the dining
room. The rooms were prettily de
corated with flowers and cordiality
reigned everywhere. Of course the
great event of the afternoon was the
burning of the mortgage and while
this was taking place Mrs. Robert
Mackinnon read a humorous poem
comparing a mortgage to a cigar. Mrs
Fairbanks' report of the four and a
half years existence of the club house
Is given in full below and is a history
of which the association is justly
proud. The question of a community
house was Informally discussed and
some of the men present expressed the
greatest admiration for the results
accomplished, one man saying that he
doubted if ny body of men in town
could sho. a better record for the
same length of time.
Mrs. Fairbanks' Report.
We are met today to rejoice over
the fulfillment, in part, of what a few
women hoped they might do for this
village, along certain lines. In 1911
a corporation was formed, to be called
the Woman's Club House Association.
The Ideal before us was philanthropic.
So far as the purchase of this house
was a part, for of course this building
alone could not yield any revenue, our
efforts so far have been successful.
We have furnished a rest room for

people from out of town who come
here for shopping, to attend public
gatherings or are passing through our
village and wish for a resting place
while detained for any reason. In
this we think we have helped our mer
chants and other business men. The
matron tells me that since the rest
room was opened In the fall of 1911
nearly 900 persons have registered,
representing 23 states, several from
Canada and one from England. Of
course many from nearby towns have
not registered. It is also of use to
some of our own club women living
in suburbs of our village. Many times
young women and girls from out of
town have been allowed to come to
some public evening function, spend
ing the night here under Mrs. Eaton's
care. The house has also been used
by individuals and societies for social
purposes. We hope there may be a
growing use along this line. The
rooms available for rent are occupied
by women only.
But the work that has been most
satisfactory to all Is that of the so
cajled industrial committee. I think
social and industrial would better ex
press the efforts of that committee.
For three years, beginning each win
ter after the holiday season, these
rooms have been opened on certain
evenings for young women's classes
for work and Boclal enjoyment." La
dies have been here to give instruc
tion in plain sewing, in dress making,
embroidery, crochet, and other kinds
