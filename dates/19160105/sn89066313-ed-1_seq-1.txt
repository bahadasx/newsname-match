Mrs. Virginia C. Meredith,
Cambridge City, Ind.
David l.ubin or Home, Italy, Amer
ican delegate to the International In
stitute of Agriculture, taught by liv
ing examples on the University Audi
torium stage last night the workings
of his parcel post plan whereby farm
products can be marketed directly to
the consumer.
Howard A. Cass, state superintend
ent of schools, was a olunteer chos
en to represent the Producer. A stout
man was asked to sit on the opposite
side of the state to represent the Con
sumer. Although he was chosen be
cause of his size, somehow he didn't
look just right to Mr. l.ubin. who
thought that a woman would person
ify the Consumer more correctly.
"Would a woman volunteer?"
After considerable urging, one was
found who was willing to come on the
stage and sit in the chair of the Con
sumer. "Now who'll be the Post office?" ask
ed Mr. l.ubin.
"I'll play I'ostotlice." said Jewell
Mayes, secretary of the State Hoard
of Agriculture. "I used to play a dif
ferent kind of postotlice when I was
oung," be added. Mr. Mayes' chair
was midway between those of the
other two liing examples.
'I'd Trailed Business al II
The necks of the audience were
craned as Mr. l.ubin tore up strips of
paper and demonstrated how the farm
er could stay at home and how the
consumer could stay at home and yet
transact business, lly a system of
cards, coupon books and charts this
could be effected, according to Mr.
l.ubin. The producer would be given
a number, which would be the only
mark of his identity known to the con
sumer. "Instead of thirty-five or forty lit
tle parcels a day. as we have under
the present system." said Mr. l.ubin.
"We would have great trainloads
shipped every day.'
This demonstration by living exam
ples was given after the main pro
gram of the evening, in which M. 1).
Munn. president of the American Jer
sey Cattle Club. 1 I. Lewis, president
of the State Hoard of Agriculture, Mr.
l.ubin and John Temple Craves, edi
tor of the New York American, were
the speakers.
Hoh the Germans Organize.
Mr. l.ubin in his main discussion
told of the Landswirtschaftsrat, Un
economic agricultural organization of
Germany, which in his opinion has
enabled Germany to withstand the as
saults of the combined world, A
chart was used in describing this sys
tem of rural credits and scientific
marketing. The base of a pyramid
represented the township organiza
tion; the layer above formed the coun
ty organizations; the smaller layer
above composed the state organiza
tions; all these were capped by the
apex, the landswirtschaftsrat of the
nation.
The seventy-two members with
headquarters in Herlin have the pow
ers of initiative and referendum in all
matters of law concerning agriculture.
The complete organization is a semi
official Information bureau for the
scientific marketing of agricultural
products. This, according to Mr.
l.ubin. renders a trust in food pro
ducts an impossibility.
Staff .Shims Economic SlaPis.
A long staff tapering toward one end
with a knob attached was used olten
by Mr. l.ubin in illustrating the eco
nomic status of a nation. The taper
ing, knobbed end represented urban
life; the thick end, rural life. By
grasping the cane in the middle, Mr.
l.ubin showed a nation stable because
its radical, progressiva elements the
"tid of the stick that hax a tendency to
fly up was countered in this tendency
by the conservative eleir.i-nt tha end
of the stick that pulled downward.
'This, lie said, represented Germany's
' condition.
! The hand shifting on the stick to
ward the large end represented ilia
I United States. The much advertised
prosperity ot the American fanw r.
' lie said, is similar to the case of Koine,
I when Tiberius Gracchus cried, "Koine
is dying!" The Romans showed him
miles of marble palaces and pointed to
former times of comparative poverty,
lint Home died, cited Mr. I.'lliin, and
today Americans go to ;ec the ruins.
Fmor.s Hural Credit Sj-leiii.
"Why? Because." he explained, "the
landowning farmers were forced into
debt and were forct-d eventually from
their lands by the owners of these pal
aces and Home crumbled into dust."
Mr. I.ubiu commended u rural credit
system which would give credit to th"
farmer in place of the banker.
After Mr. I.uhilfs address, J. M.
Aley of Kansas City made a motion
that a committee be appointed by Mr.
Mayes to confer further with Mr. I.u
biu on the subject. The motion was
passed, and the conference was set
for 10 o'clock this morning.
M. M. Sweetman of Kansas City
Sweetman of Kansas City
presented a motion, which was passed,
i to commend the spirit of Mr. l.ubin.
Xen York Keillor Speuks.
I Mr. Graves spoke briefly in com-
jmendation of Mr. l.ubin and the work
i in the economics of a-iicult.ire which
he is carrying on.
"I consider David La'dn the great
est agricultural economist living to
day." said Mr. l.ubin. "1 came here
to hear him talk in his own way. and
I am convinced that he is riiht. For
twenty years he has given his con-
secrated labor to the gospel of Indus -
trial and agricultural emancipation.
and his cause is greater than any otli-
er cause or principle in this country.
'No principle of neutrality has been
violated," continued Mr. Graves, "by
Mr. I.ubin's praise of German eco
nomics. We are blind indeed if we
fail to profit by the splendid object
lesson furnished us by this nation.
It is for us to study the methods of
the successful and to profit by them.
I. P. Lewis Itniist farming.
P. 1. Lewis praised the business of
fanning.
"I am proud that I am a farmer,"
lie said. "It is the greatest business
in the world. The man who makes
two blades of grass grow where but
one grew before leaves (he world bel
ter than lie found it."
The importance of the dairy cow to
agriculture and to civilization was dis
cussed by Col. M. D. Munn. president
of the American Jersey Cattle Club,
in an address on "Dairying, Yesterday,
Today and Tomorrow." Colonel Munn
traced the history of dairying as dat
ing from the earliest times of civili
zation to the present, noting the ni'-n-tion
of "lowing herds" by the ancient
poets, Vergil, Horace and Homer.
BABIES TO THE FRONT
Little People Are Subjects of
Lectures for Farmers'
Week Guests.
Those who planned the Farmers'
Week program for this year have
given the small master or mistress of
the household recognition, as well as
livestock, grain, fruits and various
factors connected with the farm.
Elizabeth Kempster. 11 months old.
daughter of Prof, and Mrs. II. L.
Kempster, was the exponent this morn
ing of babies' rights as Miss Louise
Stanley lectured on and demonstrated
the proper methods of feeding the
baby.
Elizabeth's bright brown eyes, un
usually knowing for one of her age,
seemed to take in the situation fully
as 200 women heard of the scientific
methods in feeding which made her
a perfectly healthy child, alert to
everything that goes on around her.
Just Like a Gronn-Up.
Elizabeth is hut little trouble to her
parents. She drinks from a cup al
most as well as any grown-up and
has been doing so since she was S
months old. Her food since this time
has been cow's milk. Miss Stanley
emphasized that cows' milk is to be
preferred over prepared foods, both
because of its cheapness and because
it is a whole food. She pointed out
that a child can be brought up on
$2..10 a month if cow's milk is used,
while prepared foods cost as much as
?S a month.
Six home economics instructors are
conducting the women's short course
this year. This morning Miss Hllde
gard Kneeland lectured on the busi
ness of providing three meals a day
at the least cost and yet so planning
them that they furnish the constituents
of a perfect food.

A proposed ordinance for the retir
ing of $1.1,001) in water and light bonds
on Apri1 1, was defeated. Council
man J. It. Lipscomb recommended
that a complete report of the finances
of the water and light plant should
be made before the council took any
action on the bonds. The council
should also, he said, be fully informed
as to the improvements that are now
being made. Councilman E. G. Davis
was also opposed to the ordinance, al
though he withheld his vote, because
of the short consideration which had
been given the measure.
Upon the motion of Councilman E.
II. McDonnell the recommendations in

referred to the fire committee for in
vestigation. Councilman Kellogg and Shaw were
absent.

PURE MILK A NEED
Topic Is Discussed at Lunch
eon for Southwestern
Jersey Breeders.
The Jersey cow was the chief topic
of a two-hour discussion at the Com
mercial Club's luncheon for the South
west Jersey Cattle Breeders' Associa
tion at the Virginia Grill today. This
association is the most forceful and
active of its kind in the country, ac
cording to Jewell Mayes, secretary of
the State Hoard of Agriculture.
J. C. Hisey of Kansas City urged
that with the facts available on cat
tle breeding at the College of Agri
culture, and the "steam" of the South
west Breeders' Association, Missouri
should revolutionize the dairy busi
ness and save the babies that are
dying from bad milk. Missouri is
breeding the world's best dairy cattle
at the College of Agriculture.
President A. Ross Hill of the Uni
versity averred that some evidence
of the .estimate placed on the dairy
department of the Uiversity might be
had from the fact that all the scholar
ships of the National Dairy Show,
with one exception, had been used at
the University of Missouri. One-fifth
of all the heads of dairy husbandry
departments in the United States are
graduates of Missouri's dairy depart
ment, he said, and two-fifths or more
of the instructors in all dairy hus
bandry departments came from the
University of Missouri..
Dr. Paul Paquin, director of pub
lic health of Kansas City, formerly
professor of comparative medicine in
the University, told the cattle breed
ers that pure milk for the babies was
the real basis for food supply. He
prophesied a time when prosecution
would be unnecessary in getting clean
milk.

Radically or Beaten.
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 It is re
ported today that Senator Kern has
deserted President Wilson's prepared
ness program. It is thought that the
program will either be radically
changed or beaten.
The greatest opposition in Congress
is against the plan or Secretary Garri
son for the increase of the army and
the possibility of conscription or other
compulsory military service.
When seen today. Senator Kern re
fused to make any statement concern
ing his reported change in attitude
toward President Wilson's plan.

"XO CITY HAM THIS YKAK"
But Mayor FreM. Prosperity for
Columbia In Mnnj Other Ways.
Mayor J. M. Batterton does not think
that Columbia will have a new city
hall by the end of this year, but be
lieves the movement will have a suffi
cient start to insure a building next
year. Mr. Batterton said this morn
ing that street paving should be in
creased, for, though Columbia has lots
of paved streets now, there is always
room for more.
Mayor Batterton was very busy to
day. To use his expression, he "had
about a thousand warrants to sign."
The city is paying the bills allowed at
the regular monthly meeting of the
City Council last night.
The mayor complimented the Col
lege of Agriculture on the success of
Farmers' Week. In his opinion the
people of Columbia and Boone County
don't pay enough attention to the
meetings.

Arter the conference, it was announced
that the United States would wait for
full information before determining
