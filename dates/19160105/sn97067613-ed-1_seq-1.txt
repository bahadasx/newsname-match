prompted Cornelius Vanderbilt to trans
port the whole "Merry Countess" com
pany to his Newport home for a special
performance some years ago, is the dan
seuse featured in Kalem's four act

Call of the Dance." Miss Dolly is one of
New York's theatrical idols and her ap
pearance in the "Broadway Favorites"
feature is a leather in Kalem's pap.

child of the slums, in the motion picture
production. The girl's passion for danc
ing lifts her from her squalid surround
ings, o a place among the most famous
artists on the stage. Her beauty al
most brings about ber destruction, how

her. "The Call of the Dance" comes to
