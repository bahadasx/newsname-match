KAISERS MALADY CANCER OF THROAT;
HAS LOST SPEECH, LE MATIN' INSISTS
Pan:., Jan. 4.?"Le Matin" affirms, notwithstanding denials, that
the German Emperor is suffering from cancer of the throat and il no
longer ?.ble to speak.
"In February, 1911," according to "L- Matin" "the doctors were
considering whether it was necessary to remove the entire larynx, in
order to stay the progress of the disease That raised the question as
to whether the Emperor would be able to speak if such an operation
were performed. The leading specialists of every capital in Europe
were consulted. It was learned that an eminent surgeon of Paris had,
with ar. artificial larynx and a breathing tube opening into the trachea,
restored the power of speech to cancerous patients who had the
affected organs wholly removed."
This ?doctor, whose name "Le Matin" withholds for reasons of pro?
fessional etiquette was asked to go to Berlin by the German Ambassa?
dor. An offer was made to him of 100,000 francs and all his expenses.
and he ?vas requested to frirrg with him a patient who had been fitted
with the apparatus, so that the Emperor himself might see if he was
able to speak.
"Meanwhile, as a result ol a minor operation with a bistoury and a
tew weeks' absolut? rest, the Emperor's condition improved, as is often
the case in this disease, the progress of which is implacable, hut slow.
It is an 'thcr operation ^f this kind which ha just been performed, but
it is only pallativc. The German F.mperor must either make up his
mind to complete removal of the larynx or he stirled by the growth.
"This explains why the Emperor went neither to Warsaw, Con?
stantinople nor Brussels."
