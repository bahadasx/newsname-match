"Watchful Waiting" is Different There;
Munitions Flow From Factories
in Vast Quantities Since Double
Eagle Scored on Czar
BIG SLAV BEAR IS
NOT HIBERNATING
Fully Awake With No intention of Going
Into Winter Quarters; Will Put Five
Million Fresh Troops
in Field
By I'nited Press.
PKTKOGHAD, Jan. r,. Watchful
waiting, that well known American
policy regarding Mexico some month
ago, siums up the war situation in
Russia today, but watchful waiting in
Russia has a meaning all its own.
Whereas, Uncle Sam, after expert
curing a few pinpricks in his pa
tience, remained passive, the great
Russian bear after sustaining a heal
thy, life-sized wallop on his tender
moiit let out a roar that shook the
eurth continents away. Reduced 'o
pluin Knglish, the roar was:
"(live me munitions; I've got
enough men."
That was several months ago.
Russia's greatest arsenal, near Petro
grad, had been blown to smithereens;
the armies of Grand Imke Nicholas,
yielding to the Austro-German steam
roller, had been driven from the Car
pathians buck into Russia and hl
lost Warsaw und the whole of Poland;
there was political dissension in
Rusnia; Manning semi revolutionary
outbreaks were occurring here and
there; the ever advancing enemy was
threatening even Moscow, and the
greatest seaport in the Baltic, Riga
appeared to b about to fall.
In winter bears usually hibernate,
but all these things and more which
happened to the Russian beur in the
summer and fi ll of 1313 precluded
any Idea of his going Into winter quar
ters this year. Russia Is today the
most active winter bear extant.
Russia has now mobilized her indus
tries und shells and other munitions
in great quantities have begun to flow
from the factories and shop In every
Important Russian city; the Russian
caLinet has been reformed with par
ticular reference to a more active con
duct of the war; the peasants who
used to drink vodka have become used
to a Vodkaless Russia and are put
ting their profits from vodkalesL har
vestshence bigger harvests into
the provincial banks; Grand Duke
Nicholas has been superseded by the
Czar as commander-in-chief and has
taken hold of the important campaign
in the Caucasus. Stirred to renewed
vigor under its ruler, the army has
ued the shells born of the industrial
mobilization and repulsed the enemy
In the vicinity of Riga, besides putting
III in on the defensive elsewhere.
These and many more things have
happened itv Russia since the double
eagle whacked the bear on the snout.
The roar for munitions which the bear
let out Boon reached Japan, England
and America, and for the last three
months rifles, sheila and cannon have
been pouring into the Pacific and Arc
tic port3. Canadian ice breakers will
keep Archangel open all winter for
ii-nnition-laden ships from America.
Heavily loaded trains are crawling
across the Siberian plains in almost
endless procession, stopping here and
there to deposit rifles and cartridges
for the men who have been training
with sticks and only lacked the arms
wherewith to join the armies now pre
paring for Russia's future campaign.
With the beginning of the New
Year various estimates place the num
licr of fresh-armed Russian troops at
five million. At least two million
more are being armed at the rate of
over half a million a month. An addi
tional million of t went y-y ear-oid
youths were called up on December 4.
These will take their places in the
ranks early In the year.
Russia's veterans already holding
the battle-line from Riga to the Black
Sea and operating in the Caucasus are
oKtlmnted to total at least 4.000,000,
ell hardy fighter making the total
of Russian military strength in Mgtit
In sieht approximately twelve million
men.
Like England, France and Italy,
Russia is preparing to fight in the
Balkans. This campaign, which is
already under way, is under the lead
ership of General Dimitrieff, ex-com
mander of the Ninth Bulgarian army,
who renounced Czar Ferdinand and
Bulgaria, and sent hack the military
decorations tendered him by hi
former sovereign. Dimitrieff's first
objective is Bulgaria, anticipation of
which early in December sent Austro-
German and Bulgarian regiments
hastily to Rustchik, the nearest Bul
garian cily to the Russian border.
It was Russia that delivered Bul
garia from the Turkish yoke. When
faced by the Russians as a foe, led by
a. former popular general of the Bul
garian army, wholesale desertions
from the Bulgar forces are considered
a potent possibility.
Russian forces too, have been sent
in ample numbers to the Caucasus in
order, if necessary, to lend aid to the
British in the event the Suez canal

PROGRAM
OF DEFENSE
IS OPPOSED
Prospect that Preparedness Plans Will Be
Defeated Unless Situation Changes;
Defection of Senator Kern
is Blow
By I'nited Press.
WASHINGTON, Jan. u. President
Wilson's preparedness plans are
beaten unlesB they are materially
modified. This is said to be the opin
ion of the administration itself.
The defection of Kern, the Demo
cratic leader in the senate, was final
proof to the White House that its
plans will not carry.
The chief reason for the opposition
of Kern is said to be that the people
of Indiana are opposed to the defense
program. The political relationship
between Kern and Bryan has always
been close.
leaders with whom Bryan has
talked say he is viciously bitter
against the defense program and la
threatening to stump the county prior
to the Democratic national convention
in order to arouse sentiment against
It and against a second term for
Wilson.
CO. BOARD
IS WINDING
UP WORK
The board of county commissioners
will conclude Its labors for the reg
ular January meeting this afternoon.
The greater part of today was taken
up, as was the greater part of yester
day afternoon, in auditing and allow- f
Ing bills for different items against I
the countv. These bills and accounts '
will total somewhere between six and
seven thousand dollars, and will come
out of the several funds of the ctunty.
The bridges have drawn heavily on
the county during the past year, but
the claims from that fund for Decem
ber will probably run lighter for De
cember than for preceding months.
Ed Burney appeared before the?
board this aftprnoon and asked that
a road be opened in accordance with
the petition filed, on the section Hue
between sections 4-9 for ad istance of
one and one-half miles in township G,
tange 7 west.
On motion the road was declared
opened as a county road as petitioned
and the township board authorized to
act.
On motion the county assessor was
authorized to begin the assessment
of the 1916 taxes in accordance with
the provisions of section 2 of chapter
193 of the session laws of 1915.
All routine business has been dis
posed of and all matters which have
come before the commissioners set
tled in regular order at this mectins,
with the exception of a few matters
wherein the claims of accounts due
were filed too late for action at this
meeting. In these cases the matters
were passed and the parties given per
mission to refile before, the Fbrunry

ATTEMPT
ON LIFE OF
ATTORNEY
Load of Buckshot is Fired Through Win
dow of County Officer's Home at
Ada Early Today and Barely
Misses Mark
THREAT IN LETTER
IS PUT INTO EFFECT
Shot Follows Demand that Efforts to Lo
cate Barn Burners be Stopped;
Outgrowth of Fight on
Cattle Dipping
By United Press.
ADA, Okla., Jan. 5. An attempt on
the life of A. L. Bullock, county attor
ney here, was made at 4.30 o'clock
this morning by an unknown party.
A load of buckshot was fired
through the window of Bullock's
home and barely missed Its mark.
Bullock says he was aroused by hear
ing a noise outside the house near
the window and ho fell back just as
the shot was fired. His assailant evi
dently fled after discharigng his
weapon as no second shot was fired.
Oficers were at once notified of the
attempted killing and went to the
scene, investigating all possible
traces, but finding no clue. The
authorities have sent for bloodhounds
and will make every possible effort
to locate the man responsible for the
crime.
Ten days ago County Attorney Bul
lock received anonymous letters de
manding that he cease his efforts to
run down the men who burned the
barns of two of the county commis
sioners and threatening him with vio
lence In the event he refused to de
sist from such efforts.
The burning of the commissioners'
barns was the outgrowth of a fight
that is being made on the cattle tick
dipping campaign. In the course of
the war against the policy of the com
missioners in attempting to free the
county of cattle ticks, the opponents
of cattle dipping threatened to retal
iate against the commi!oners. As a
result the barns were destroyed and
in several piaces dipping vats were
dynamited.
At the time the barns of the com
missioners were burned the county
attorney announced that, he would
leave nothing undone to bring to
Jute the "firebugs" and some time
after that he received threatening let
ters. The local newspaper com
mended the attitude of the county at
torney and denounced the barn-burners'
and they, too, received anony
mous letters, threats being made to
blow up their plants.
The attempt on Bullock's life today
has deeply stirred the entire com
munity and it i relieved that the offi
cers will redouble their efforts to ap
prehend the guilty parties.
CONFER ON

WASHINGTON. Jan. 5. President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing were
in conference for nearly an hour this
morning, threshing out the interna
tional crisis that has developed since
the sinking of the liner Persia with
Americans on board.
At the conclusion of the conference
Secretary Lansing said the govern
ment was still "waiting for facts" be
fore taking any final action.

ELABORATE
This is probably the most elaborate deceptive device used by any of the belligerent armies. The French have
posted a large number of their 220-centimeter mortars In woods and other places, where they are hidden from
the enemy's "air eyes." In order to deceive the German aviators, the French have placed very clever fake guns
around the real mortars. They are substantially built of wood and metal to look genuine, and uniformed figures are
placed about to represent the gun squads. When an aviator appears overhead, soldiers a long way off pull Btrings
to make the figures move. Smoke also comes out of the gun muzzle.
TAX LEVIES FOR TWO
YEARS ARE COMPARED
County Assessor Dews furnishes
the following comparison of tax levies
for the past and current years:
Within the past few weeks I have
seen statements published purported
to have come from different sources
as to the increase of the taxes of
Grady county. Permit me to submit
the statement of figures below as
shown by the records and are correct:
Taxes for the Years of 1915-1914.
State purposes 1913 at 3 mill
levy. $79,g:'8.1S; ISM' at 1.3 mill levy,
$28,428.51; increase, rl,399.C7. .'
County purposes 1915 at 4 1-4 mill
levy, $90,934.21; 1914 at 3 3-4 mill levy,
181,799.24; increase, $15,134.97.
Cities and township governments
1915, $l23,9r3.40; 1914, ?88,746.03; in
crease, $35,207.37.
School districts (10S) 1915, $181,
427.90; 1914, $164,578.03; increase,
$16,849.27.
Total increases, $11S,591.2S.
Now let us detail the above and ar
rive at facts. The state board of
equalization and excise board has the
authority and fixes the state levy
which is .0035 for 1915 whereas It
was .0013 for 1914, which as you see
from the above, made the state tax
$51,399.07 more, which is nearly half
of the entire increase.
Next '.-omes the county which
amount is fixed by the county com
missioners and levy made by the
county excise board, which is com
posed of the county judge, county
clerk, county treasurer, county attor
ney and the county superintendent.
This shows an increase of $15,134.97
as shown above and the county com
missioners state they were forced to
ask for this extra levy to replace the
washed-out bridges, culverts, etc.,
which the high waters in the spring
damaged.
Next item is cities and township
governments which control them
selves and fix the amount required
ROCK ISLAND
DEFENDANT
F. K. Hardie, through his attorneys,
Bond & Melton, today filed suit in
the district court against the receivers
of the Rock Island Railway company.
The petitioner seeks to recover from
the defendant company the sum of
$215 and interest from January L
11.15, in payment for certain cattle
killed by the defendant company's
agents.
The petitioner alleges that upon a
certain day and date in the month of
January of last year the "defendant
company carelessly and negligently
run its trains over one yellow Jersey
cow, two red heifers and one spotted
steer, thereby carelessly and negli
fently causing the death of said
cattle." The cattlo were killed at a
point on the main line of the Rock
Island one and one-hnlf mi'.es north
of the town of Pot-asset.
DEVICE TO DECEIVE ENEMY AVIATORS
- .v'A
1 -tmi
to operate their respective govern
ments and submit this to the county
excise board to make levy accord
ingly. These alone show an increase
of $33,207.37 over amount required for
1914.
Next item Is our schools of which
we have 108 districts in the county
and divided into all sorts of shapes,
Siizes and fashions, to meet the service
of the patrons. The nchool boards
have the same authority as the mu
nicipal boards and their levy is also
made by the county excise board.
The assessment of the most of the
property in the entire county Is no
higher than before and was passed
upon by the county board of equaliza
tion and also the state board after
assessment
The only material changes that I
am aware of in assessments are in
Chickasha city and these items show
on the records for themselves. An
estimate of the taxable lands in the
county shows about 45 per cent not
subject to taxation.
Please note this: The state tax Is
nearly three times more; the county
is only mill more or 50c per
$1,000 while nearly all the different
school districts have levied more and
rearly all the township governments
have more than doubled their levy for
this year.
Pardon me for taking this liberty
for asking you to publish this, but I
am absolutely in favor of our under
standing the situation and knowing
why our taxes, are so much higher on
the same valuation and whether we
can remedy it or not.
Take your tax receipts for the years
1SI5-1914 and look on the back of
them and compare the levies for the
two years and then you can easily tell
why your taxes are higher on the
same assessment. Respectfully,
JOE DEWS,
County Assessor.
TAXES ARE
BEING PAID
Treasurer Mullican reports the col
lections of 1915 taxes more than nor
mal during the closing days of that
year. For the last two weeks of 1915
there was paid Into the treasurer's
office in cash a total of $S5,000 in
round numbers, while approximately
$00,000 came In by check during that
time.
With total taxes amounting to
$482,140, half, or $241,070 due on or
before midnight of December 31, the
collections show fully 60 per cent of
the taxes of this county has been paid
before any penalty should apply.
Of the total tixes of $482,140, 40
per cent, or approximately $192,856
will apply for the maintenance and
upkeep of the city and the district
schools of Orady county.
