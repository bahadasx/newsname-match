London, Jan. 6.—'Under the terms
Hf of the compulsory-foilitary service bill,
slS introduced In the house of commons
$§C| today, all males between the ages of 18
,*\ifand 41 who are bachelors or widowers
without childen dependent on them are
•Meltable for military service. Ireland is
Pj?| excluded from the terms of the meas
Mi ore.
«F|j The bill providing for compulsory
military service was introduced in the
"^p house of commons today lay Premier
§gp|Asquith.
Many members of the house had ob
iM? tallied leave to return from the front
to vote on the bllL
wpjj This Earl of Derby, who conducted
^yp thf' recruiting campaign, was in the
gj^ersr gallery.
fV?
Qr«at Debate Probable.
The bill promises to bring on the
sharpest parliamentary struggle since
the war began. The report of the-Earl
v^of Derby on his recruiting plan ex-
1
i! plains why the cabinet found It neces
*sary to "bring forward a measure of
compulsory enlistment of unmarried
"§men."
More than 2,500,000 men in England,
Scotland and Wales enrolled them
selves, but after those engaged In ln
dispensible Industries- and medically
unfit have been winnowed out, about
1,100,000 available to bear arms remain.
There are if0,000 unmarried men who
failed to come forward and the gov
ernment will now attempt, to redeem
^|l -the premier's pledge that married men
df .will not be called out as long a
'.•^X considerable fraction of unmarried

AsQuith. opened .his., address
•^?%^,a»'»aiialj^i::»| in the

-hat during the Derby campaign nearly
,.000,000 had offered their services,
Ven deducting those rejected because
physical disability, the total was
'y In excess of 2,500,000.
ys*- •"•"hThese are wonderful, encouraging
figures," the premier continued. "They
ought to convince both our allies and
our enemies that the people of this
county have, their hearts in this war."
Mr. AsQuith said no case had been
made out for general compulsion and
that the bill he was introducing could
be supported by those opposed to con
scription.
Exemption Is Possible,
Mr. Asquith said he was unable,
after making the largest hypothetical
deduction, to consider the number of
unrecruited men aa anything but a sub
stantial and even considerable amount.
He added that Sir John Simon, whose
resignation as home secretary was an
nounced yesterday, thought the figures
might be reduced to an estimable quan
tity*
If he" had shared this view, Mr. As
quith said, the present dohtingency
would not have arisen, but ue could not
think that. The primary obirgation
was to keep faith at all cost with the
married men.
The prime minister said exemption
from service could be claimed under the
[terms of the bills on the same grounds
fc* men tested under the Derby, plan,
these grounds Include consclensclous
Exemption to performing military ser
vice.
./ Other grounds for exemption, the
S ^^remier said. Included ill-health, phy
sical infirmity, the necessity to sup
•pdrt dependant persons, and the fact
of being engaged on work of national
Importance.
Bill {ftwlMma Promise.®^
The bill, Mr. Asqulth continued, was
mited to' the redemption of the prom
he had, made publicly to married
Thls pledge had been given at a
when overwhelming evidence had
given htm that married men, who
ere' willing to serve, were holding
back.in large numbers. They needed to
be reassured that, having regard for
their circunistances and the' business
tkey ^re*e carrying on, they could
^opnt upon their term of service being
postponed until the younger and single
men had been called 'out. If assurances
fe? 'had 'not been given at that time there
wouid iiave been danger that the whole

vsisi "WJiere, then, should we be now?"

^he premier added that if he were
itoryye confrunlcu wliu some: siiuaiion
nt the'present time he would take pre
cisely the same course. He said he had
^Mbred DO protest against his pledge.
Jdthci he had been a strong supporter
0^ the system of voluntary service, Mr.
jAjMPQith decUured he was convinced of
[the necessity of. the compulsion bill,

Policy of Non-intervention by Euro

Washington, Jan. —Chief interest
in the work of the Pan-American
scientific congresa again today ap
peared centered in the section for the
study of international law, where al
most all the speakers discussed some
phase of Pan-Americanism.
An avowal of policy of non-inter
vention was advocated as an unavoid
able necessity in the creation of a
greater Pan-American unity, by Dr,
Louts Alfredo Otero, of Colombia.
He insisted that this was imperative,
as their policy calculated to prevent the
colonization of any of the eastern
countries by European governments.
Unqualified support of thffe Monroe
doctrine and what he characterized as
its complement, the Drago doctrine,
was given by Dr, Manuel Cavalcanti,
of Brazil, In an address on the prob
lems of international law peculiar to
America.
The Drago doctrine, Dr. Cavalcanti
said, stands In the world of finance for
what the Monroe doctrine stands in
the world of force.
Dr. Enrique Gil, delegate from the
law school of the National University
of Buenos Aires, discussed Pan-Amer
icanism in "the light of traditional in

Such information as bad been re

that the principles of civilized war

that the incident which suddenly re

Paris Paper Says Ruler Has Cancer of
Throat Operation to Give Relief.
Paris, Jan. 5.—The Matin affirms,
notwithstanding denials, that the em
peror of Germany is suffering from
cancer of the throat and is no longer
able to speak.
"In February, 1911," according to
the Matin, "the doctors were consid
ering whether it was necessary to re
move the entire larynx In order to
stay the progress of the disease. They
raised the question as to whether the
emperor would be able to speak if
such an operation were performed.
The leading specialists of every capital
In Europe were consulted.
"It was learned that an eminent
surgeon of Paris had, with an artificial
larynx and a breathing tube opening
into the trachea, restored the power of
speech to cancerous patients who had
undergone total ablation of the affect
ed organs.
"This doctor, whose name the Matin
withholds for reasons of professional
etiquette, was asked to go to Berlin by
the German ambassador. He was of

another operation of this kind which

Athens, Greece, Jan. 4, via Paris,
Jan. 6.—Prince Andrew of Greece,
brother of King Constantino, In an in
terview today with the correspondent
of the Associated Press, described the
aerial bombardment of the allies camp
at Zeeltenllk on the outskirts of Sa
lonikl, on Dec. 30.
"The bombardment and the reply of
the fleets anchored in the roads of Sa
lonikl," said the prince, "was one of
the most extraordinary sights imagina
ble. I was riding back from the morn*
trig's work with my regiment at about
^0:30, when I was started by a deafen
ing explosion some 200 yards away. A
great cloud of black smoke arose* fol
lowed shortly by three more explosions
at regular Intervals. Then came tins
familiar rocket-like sound of a shell
passing thru the air, evidently fired by
one of the warships in the harbor.
"Naturally my first thought was that
for some reason the fleet was bom
barding Salonlki. Therefore I rode to
the nearest British post. Then for the
first time I looked up and saw three
machines, fully 3,000 feet high, turning
over the harbor toward the northwest,
in which direction they finally dlsap^
peared.
Bombs Dropped With Preoision.
"The bombs dropped with precision,
killing and wounding a number of the
allies' soldiers. Meanwhile the ftrlnf
of the fleet grew thunderous. It was
impossible to hear yourself think. In
a short time it became evident tlutt tha
fire .from the fleet was more dabj|eroua
than the bombs from the aeroplanes, aa
some of the shells, aimed wild,

Social Demooratio Leader DenounoM
Attitude, of Minority Party*
Berlin, Jan. 4, via London, Jan..4.—«
[Delayed.]—iDr. Karl Wolfgang Heine**
social democratic member of the reioh
stag, writing In the International Cor
respondence, bitterly attacks the
minority of his party, which is oppos
ing the sanctioning of the proposed
new war credit.
"Enemies, as Germany now stands,
powerful and Unified, refuse all sug
gestions of peace," Dr. Heine say.
"Certainly would not be ready to grant
peace to a German empire weakened
by inner dissention. They would push
across our borders, kill hundreds of
thousands of our brothers and bring
all the miseries of an enemy Invest
ment into our country.
"Those who destroyed party unity
to oppose the war crcdit do not really
want it refused. They enjoy the nega
tive vote because they are assured
that others will look out for the safety
of the fatherland
"Let me say it plainly once and for
all that such tactics show nelthex
courage nor love for truth."
Serves to Prolong War.
Under the heading "A Social Demo
cratic .Split," the Tages Zeitung re
produces a statement made by Dr. Karl
Peters, who said:
"They (the minority) have actually
succeeded in opposing the war credit,
and in fact. Just after their comrades
in the west had spoken up in opposi
tion to a weakly peace.
"They strutted around proclaiming
they had shortened the war and they
had used the most certain method ot
prolonging It, for It is plain to every
one not entirely crazy, that their pro*
cedure was bound to awaken among
the enemies of Germany the hope that
the empire eventually could be 'tired
out.' That this is a fight to the last
man should be apparent."
Artillery Engagements Continue.
Berlin, by wireless to Sayvllle, Jan*
5.—'Fighting with' artillery and mines
at several points on the Franco-BeN
