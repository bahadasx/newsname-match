DENISON NOW
A DRY TOWN
Three Saloons Close Their Doors
Prompt!/ Friday Night—Disposed
of Most of their Stocks.
NO ROWDYISM AT LAST HOUR
Owners to Bow to Will of People and
Will Now Engage in Other
Lines of Business.
The saloons of Crawford county
passed out of existence on the evening
of December 31st, and from reports
from the towns) in the county where
saloons have Been permitted to oper
ate there was very little, if any. com
motion during the last few 'hours.
Here in Denison it had been expected
that there would be some rowdyism
and special arrangements had been
made by tlie city authorities to have
extra officers on duty during the day
to quell any disturbance, but they
were liot pressed into service and not
a single arrest was made for drunk
enness. The saloon keepers them
selves are to be commended for en
deavoring to avoid any disturbances
and long before the time for closing
the doors of the tyiree saloons in Den
ison were closed.
A tremendous business was done
(luring the last few days here in Den
ison. Liquor was sold in ^arge,
quan
tities and stored away cellars to be
used during the long drouth ahead. A
full car load of bottled beer was ship
ped to one saloon keeper in Denison
on Thursday anc^ before 8 o'clock Fri
day night not a bottle remained. Or
ders were taken at the saloon and
purchasers went to the car where they
received their goods.
The McCarthy saloon- was the first
to close its doors and the last jitney
for a glass of beer was laid out on the
counter about 7 o'clock. The Flinn
saloon closed its doors at 8:20, Mr. P.
T. Flinn,'ihe proprietor, fearing that
there might be disturbance, turned
out the lights and gave orders for ev
eryone to leave the building. No
soonor had the patrons departed than
drays were backed up to the saloon,
and the remaining goods carted away.
The Saggau saloon remained open un
til 8:30 and this building was so
packed that it was impossible for an
other man to enter. The lights were
turned out here and th« crowd' dis
persed in order to avoid any disturb
ance.
People who expected to buy liquor
at bargain counter prices on the elop
ing day were disappointed, as saloon
keepers had planned on only keeping
enough in stock to last up until the
closing day, so that it was not neces­

sary for them to cut prices in order
to dispose of the remaining bottled
goods. From early morning until late
at night on the 31st vehicles were
backed up to the various saloons and
loaded to their capacity with cases of
beer, whiskey and other bottled'wines
and cordials.
Iowa has now joined the list of dry
states of the union, the result of the
repeal of the mulct law, which was
passed by the last general assembly.
Under this act statutory action is re
stored ponding the action of the next
legislature and the people on the pro
posed constitutional amendment for
prohibition, wjiich is to be disposed of
within the next two years. In Iowa fif
teen breweries were closed down and
between 2,000 and 2,500 bartenders
and employes of these breweries have
lost their positions. City, county and
federal governments will lose an an
nual revenue of $765,550. The brew
eries put out of business by the re
peal of the mulct law are capitalized
by nearly five million dollars.
Crawford county probably suffered
less than any county in the state of
Iowa by having saloons in operation.
Without a single exception, the saloon
keepers of this county have lived ir
to the letter of the law. Here in Den
ison there has been very little drunk
enness and where there have been
cases it has generally been the fact
that it was transients who imbibed
too freely. There is considerable spec
ulation as to the conditions which -will
be found during the coming year and
many believe that there will be more
drunkenness with tlie state dry than
there has been when the saloons were
in operation.
Since the first of the year the coun
ty has been flooded with literature
from wholesale liquor houses who are
making a business of supplying the
goods direct to the consumer. Under
the law liquor may be shipped into the
state for private use, providing that
the packages are labeled designating
the contents and the consignee will
be required to sign for the package,
either at the freight or exipress of
fice. It is now up to the officers of the
state of Iowa to see that the laws are
enforce^ and if this is done we be
lieve th&t everyone will be well satis
fied with the results.

DISASTROUS FIRE
AT BOCK GROVE
Fire This Morning Destroys $25,000
Worth of Property at Buck Grove
Before Controlled
STARTS IN ASMUSSEN STORE
Reiff & Hamar, L. C. Asmussen, Neu
baum Garage and Barber
Shop Are Burned.
Buck Grove, Jan. 5—(Spec'ial to the
Review)—Buck Grove experienced a
terrible fire this morning at 8 o'clock,
which destroyed property estimated
at $25,000 before it was finally put ur
der coptrol.
The tire started at S o'clock this
morning in the store of L. C. Asmus
sen, who conducts a general merchan
dise business, and gained such head
way that it soon spread to the sur
rounding buildings. A forty mile an
hour northwest wind whipped the
flames to such an extent that it was
feared the whole business section of
the town would be destroyed. The
general store of Reiff & Hamaj". ad
joining the Asmussen building, caught
fire and was totally dostroyed. After
this building caught flro the hotel
building, pool hall and barber shop,
one after another broke into flames
and were totally destroyed.
It was feared that the lumber yard
would catch fire, but through the he
roic efforts of forty farmers who rush
ed to Buck Grove to assist the citi
zens in subduing the flames, the small
vacant, frame building formerly used
as a garage was torn down and this
saved the lumber yard-from destruc
tion. The building owned by Dr. A.
F. Bonney, in which the post office is
located, was in immediate danger and
Postmaster Bonney made preparation
for moving the fixtures and post of
fice records, but the flames in the near
by building were subdued so it was not
necessary to take this precaution.
Mr. Asmussen, proprietor of the gen
eral store, lost his entire stock of
goods as well as all of his books. It
is impossible at this early hour to
give the loss.
ReifT & Hamer. proprietors of the
other general stor© which was destroy
ed, saved their book accounts, but the
stock was completely destroyed. Hen
ry Hamfer, one of the partners in the
firm, is critically ill at his home this
.Afternoon, suffering1' "Wjtth -a .nervous
breakdown, the result of the''excite

been for the fact that farmers from

to the alarm the damage would have
been much heavier.
OLD ROUTES RE-ESTABLISHED.
Message From Post Office Department
Thursday to This Effect—Old
Carriers Back at Work.
Postmaster Alfred Wright received
a telegram last Thursday from Mr.
Blakslor, the fourth" assistant post

out that here in Iowa where the roads
are not as good as they are back east
it was out of the question for a mail
man to serve patrons on a fifty rnilo
route, carrying the mail in autos. H^ro

While the former order has not

Menagh's Store
Disposes of Entire Herd of Angus
Cattle to Messrs. Escher & Ryan
of Irwin and Botna.
PRICE SAID TO BE $30,000.00
Herd That Put Crawford County on
the Map in the Eyes of Stock
men of Mie United States,
W. A. McHenry's fine herd of Aber
deen Angus cattle was sold yesterday
afternoon to Messrs. Escher & Ryan,
who have herds of cattle at Irwin
and Botna, Iowa. It has not been giv
en out what'this fine herd of cattle
sold or, but no doubt the total reach
ed in the neighborhood of $30,000, as
there were 175 head, among which
are the fine show herds which hav«
/been winning at the big shows for the
'piist few years.
The sale of the McHenry herd of
cottle means much to Denison. Craw
ford county and in fact the state of
Iowa, for this herd was known front
the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts
among breeders and cattle men. It
was this herd of Aberdeen Angus,
"doddies," that put Crawford county
on the map In the eyes of stock men
throughout the United States. Men
from all over the country came to
Denison. to view this herd which has
no equal in the Unite,d States. For
ihirty years Mr. W. A. McHenry has
been building up his herd and he has
spared no-expense in purchasing the
best breeding stock that cpuld be
found, and in many instances paid over
a thousand dollars to purchase a par
ticular type of animal which would
improve his herd, and for the past few
years it has been recognized as the
very best there was in the country.
No doubt the sale of the herd at
this time was due to the fact that John
Brown, who has been managing the
herd for the past sixteen years, resign
ed his position and will go to Norway,
Iowa, where he will take charge of C.
A. Tow's fine herd of Hereford cattle.
The resignation of Mr. Brown came as
a great surprise to people in this lo
cality. Mr. Brown has been associat
ed with Mr. McHenry for so many
years that no one suspected for a min
ute that he would ever consent to
leave the black "doddies." During the
years "lie has had charge of the herd
he has managed to keep up the fine
record established by Mr. McHemy!
and year after year the show herd
was sent out to the various state, fairs
and they have always brought home
the majority of the blue rtbbons. He
