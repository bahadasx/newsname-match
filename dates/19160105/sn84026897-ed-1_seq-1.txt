EDGEFIELD, S. C., WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1915
MO. 32
CHARGED WITH MURDER.
Joe Grant, tho Negro Who
Killed Durst in 1906,
Brought Back to South
Carolina.
Joe Grant, the negro who is
wanted for the killing of a white]
man at Johnston in 1906, and vh(
has been resisting extradition from
Pennsylvania, was brought to Co
lumbia last night under heavy ?uard
and lodged in the State peniteitiary.
The negro arrived at 7:4Q on
special passenger train which was
running in the place of 31, the Au
gusta Special, which was ip a wreck
yesterday morning. Giant wa?
brought from Pennsylvania to Co
lumbia by Sheriff Swearingen of
Ed ?ret? eld county. At the station
he was met by two guards from the
State penitentiary and they brought
% him up to the State House on
street car where he was transferred
to another car and taken to the
State penitentiary.
The fight to get the negro Grant
back to this State has been waged
for several years. He was accused
of killing Mr. Durst at Johnston in
Edgefield county in 1906 and fled to
Pennsylvania. A reward was of
fered for his capture and he was?!
rcognized by a detective while work
ing in a barber shop in Philadelphia.
$ After his arrest, he interposed every
legal obstacle possible, and foughv
extradition co South Carolina. The
then governor of Pennsylvania,
Tenor, honored the requisition pa-,
pera from the governor of South
Carolina, but an appeal was taken
to the courts, the case finally reach
ing the United States supreme
court. That tribunal as all others
> upheld the requisition, and then the
? new governor of Pennsylvania sud
denly announced that he would not,
honor requisition papers. The ne-J
??rant in his appeal to the
^veoN States supreme court made
sensational charges to the effect that
he could not get a fair trial in South
Carolina owing to race prejudice.
Attorney General Peeples and So
licitor Timmerman made several
trips to get the negro, and have
used every effort to this end. Gov
ernor Manniug took the matter up
actively, and in a letter to Governor
Brumbaugh set forth that Grant
could get a fair trial in this State,
and he called on the Pennsylvania)
governor in the name of justice to
surrender the negro to the South
Carolina authorities.
Nothing was known of the mat
ter again until Grant was brought]
here last night. He was in the j
wreck of the Augusta Special in
Virginia Friday night and his name
as well as that of Sheriff Swearin
gen of Edgefield were sent out on
press reports as among the number
injured. Their injuries are said to
have been only slight, however.
Grant was very talkative when
being brought from the union sta
tion to the penitentiary and men
tioned his trip and the wreck. He
was well dressed, wore a neat look
ing brown suit, overcoat and hat j
jsvith black shoes which were fresh-1
ly polished. He wore gold specta
cles and appeared to be in good
health. He complained of being;
tired from his long trip.
The governor's office last night
refused to make knoten anything
regarding the Grant matter of what
developments had taken place which
resulted in bringing him back to
this state. The governor of Penn
sylvania certainly had to honor the
requisition for the Sheriff of Edge
field to get the negro, but his rea
sons for doing so are not known.
Grant will be taken to Edgefield
and tried on an indictment charg
ing him with murder, the indict
ment having been returned against
him several years ago. It is pre
sumed that he will be kept in the
j penitentiary until court of general
[sessions convenes at Edgefield.-Co-|

FERTILIZER OUTLOOK.
Secretary Houston Issues a State
ment. Nitrates Plentiful.
Potash and Phosphate
Very High.
Washington, January ?.-A
gloomy view of prospects foi fer
tilizing next year's crops is present
ed in a statement issued to-day by
Seoretary Houston, of the depart
ment of agriculture.
Relief measures undertaken by
the department since the European
war disrupted the American pios
ph ite industry and cut off poiash
imports from Germauy will hslp,
the statement says, but they o?er
slim possibilities that the American
farmer will get a small part of (he
fertilizing materials necessary ior
his needs. Nitrogenous fertilizers
alone will be available in the quan
tities needed. \
The Secretary takes up first th?
potash supply, long since exhausted
in the United States by the German
embargo on shipments. Investiga
tion, says his statement, has shown
four sources of supply in the coun
try, but none immediately availa
ble. These are the help of the Pa
cific coast, alunite deposits in Utah,
feldspathec rocks in the East and
the mud of Searles Lake, California.
Manufacture from feldspar has
been found to be feasible, but ihr
cost is high. Development of
Searles Lake deposits presents tech
nical difficulties and title to the
property is involved. Manufactur
ers are experimenting now, the
statement says, with alunite. Kelp
is offered as the best material.
Three large concerns have begun
manufacture from kelp and Gov
ernment experts will be sent to the
Pacific coast to aid in the expert
cnenta.l'work- ? ... . . ?
Slow rrOuuction.
Production will be slow for a
long ttrae, the Seoretary points out,
Mid demand for potash in other in
dustries is so great that none manu
factured in the United States
will be available soon for agri
cultural purposes. His statement
says:
"The prices offered under exist
ing conditions by the manufactur
ers of articles will cause practically
the entire output of these concerns
to be diverted from the fertilizer
industry. It would require ninety
or more plants, costing approxi
mately $50,000, and having an ope
rating capital of 25,000 each to pro
duce the quantity needed for agri
culture. This would involve the
assumption that commercial phases
of the problem were satisfactorily
solved. The department is con
sidering all phases of the situa
tion."
The crippled state of the phos
phate industry is attributed to the
high price of sulphuric acid, much
of which is being used now in the
manufacture of war munitions. The
price has jumped from $5 to $25 a
ton. Demand for the acid is so
heavy that abandoned plants are be
ing refitted for its manufacture.
The bureau of soils meanwhile is
experimenting with the manufac
ture of phosphoric acid as a substi
tute for sulphuric.
Nitrite prices hare advanced since
the war began, but there is an abun
dant supply of nitrogenous fertiliz
ing material and the department is
endeavoring to find methods to
cheapen the cost of manufacture.
The Secretary concludes with a
warning to farmers to conserve all
fertilizing materials on the farm.
He urges crop rotation, proper
use of fertilizers and also use of
lime to increase productivity of the
soil.
A New Deputy Sheriff.
Mr. Homer Williams has resign
ed as deputy sheriff and Mr. D. D.
Brunson has been appointed to suc
ceed Mr. Williams. Sheriff Swear
ingen has had a faithful assistant
in the person of Mr. Williams and
Edgefield gives him up with keen
est regret, he having decided to re
turn to his farm in the Gilgal sec
tion. A better selection could not
have been made than Mr. Brunson
as Mr. Williams' successor. He is
the eldest son of Mr. W. P. Brun
son, a sober, steady young man of
sterling qualities. Mr. Brunson ic
making his home with his uncle.

day and we had nine ladies with
ns. We took our Confederate flag
and marched down to the art gallery
and had our pictures taken in a
group, the ladies were in it too.
We went back to the hall and the
ladies served refreshments. We had a
fine time eating and talking to the
ladies but Mr. Editor after all noth
ing like old Edgefield and the big
and welcome dinners that those
good ladies there give us every May.
I never shall forget the pleasures
and good dinners that I have had
at old Edgefield with my old broth

I am glad and proud to see old
Parksville coming up again to the
front with her fairs. She bad the
same thing a few years ago and it
seemed to be just fine.
Four of the best ladies of Sin
ton started out with a petition to
get every voter to sign it asking for
an election for prohibition They
say they will carry the whole
county. I know they would if they
would leave the Mexican out of it.
They tell me a man can take a little
whiskey and a dollar or two and
vote them any way. But undei the
law you can't keep them out, or the
negro either.
Mr. Editor, this Baptist church
here has had a debt of $300 hang
ing over it now for two years oi
more and my son being the pastoi
preached a sermon on indebtedness,
His text was "Owe no man any
thing" and at the close he told thc
church that he now wanted th(
money to pay that debt and told tht
deacons to go around through th?
congregation and get every dolla;
they could raise. To my surpris*
they got $280 and they said thej
would get the balance the next day
which they did and the debt is paid
Court convened here yesterday
the 13th and the ladies who hac
gone around with a petition asking
for an election for prohibiten
took the petition in court an(
presented it to the judge and tb
judge had it pat on file and ordere*
the election to come off on the 31s

great prohibition rally will be hel<
in town to-night. The good ladie
are working.hard to put a stop t
the whiskey traffic in the town an
not only the town but the count}
They have the Baptist pastor an
a host of good men at their backi

The Mexican, negro and the ric

JOHNSTON JJSTTftK.
Beautiful Tribute to Mr?. J. H.
Allen. Week of Prayer Ob
served. Golden Wed
ding Celebrations.
To those of us, her relatives and
friends, who knew and loved her,
the death of Mrs. J. Horde Alteo
of Edgefield. is a keen sorrow sod
to the memory of this sweet sainted
spirit, we would place a wreath of
immortelles. The world is better for
such a life, pure, sweet and gnile
less-a woman of character and"
gentle force, ruling always by love
she drew and held friends by the
magnet of unselfish love. She em
bodied all, in the loving wife, the
tender mother, the dutiful daughter
and affectionate sister, the sincere
Christian, the kind and .sympathiz
ing friend. In all her life she was
never known to speak unkindly and
her gentle influence will be missed
by all, and beyond words in the
home where she meant so mach?
"Many rise up to call her blessed."
The mound of flowers that covered
her grave, stood as a mute symbol
of affection ic which she was held.
With boundless trust, faith, pare
and olear, she now rents within the
bosom of her Saviour whom she
loved to serve. Her death has cast
a heavy pall over the lives of her
dear ones, but the memory of her
life should be a comfort and as a
sweet fragrance in their deep sor
row. God's ways are mysterious and :
we can never doubt His wisdom in
taking our loved ones-perhaps it
is to lead us along the dreary pas
sage. She has passed on first.
"Weshould not dread the voyage
which is to come,
Some one of our loved ones has
gone first has seen it-bow it is,
And is waiting nearby, loving,
i wavf-H?b?!r.
To bring ns hobie."
Those from- Johnston who at
tended the burial of Mrs. J. H.

week of prayer for foreign missions.
The Baptist choir will at an early
date begin practicing a cantata
which will be had in the church au
ditorium.
The town of Johnston is named
for Capt. Johnston conductor of
the train passing on this line when
the town came into existence. A
few weeks ago upon the death of
Capt. Johnston's daughter, Mrs.
Andrews, of North Carolina, it was
found in her will that she had left
$500 to this town, jthis to be used
for a drinking fountain, and her re
quest was that South Carolina gran
ite be used in the construction. The
gift is greatly appreciated by the
town and in accepting it, ber wishes
will be cariied out as near as pos
sible.
The first Sunday of the new year
the Baptist Sunday school started
out with 215 in attendance and a
collection of $7,12.
Christmas day was a very happy .
one for Mr. and Mrs. Owington 3.
Wertz, and others besides, for on
this day they passed the fiftieth
mile stone of their married life.
They had with them on this'occa
sion all of their children with their
families. These were Mesdames
Taylor Goodwyn of Greenwood,
DeSassure Hogan of Congaree,
and H. W. Crouch of this place;
Messrs. Getsen, Claud and Wilber
Wertz of Columbia, and Leroy
Wertz of Belton. A picture of the
entire family was taken. The day
was brightly and merrily spent by
this loving circle and all good wish
es were for this couple. A regular
ante-bellum wedding feast was
served during the day.
Misses Bessie .and Isabel Bean

of the pleasantest evenings cf the
Christmas tide. Delightful refresh
ments were served.
