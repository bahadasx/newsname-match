alumni social, which was held in
academy hall on Thursday evening,
Forty members of the B. A. alumni,
with about as many more of their
friends and former schoolmates were
present and the spirit of loyalty to Old

phatic on this occasion. Miss Marion

pleasing manner and Miss Marion

Mrs. Ellen Miles; a brief description of

New Year's Dinner and. Roll Call at the
Methodist Episcopal Church.
The New Year's dinner and roll call a
the M. E. church was a very helpful
and inspiring occasion, from both a
social and a spiritual standpoint. The
dinner, provided by the men's "Upper
Room" Bihle class, was tempting,
toothsome 8nd satisfying. Following
is the menu: Oyster stew, rolls,
doughnuts, four kinds of pie, pickles,
cheese, and coffee. One hundred and
sixty five proceded to satisfy the
"inner man," and the writer has not
yet heard a word of dissatisfaction.
During the dinner hour the Schubert
orchestra rendered several delightful
selections, thereby adding not a little
to the enjoyment of those present.
After all had dined the following
program was given : Organ voluntary,
Mrs. Bessie Adams ; scripture reading
and prayer, pastor; solo, Mrs. Mabel
Blake ; singing by the congregation,
'"Blest Be the Tie that Binds;" roll
call. . Sixty-seven members were pres
ent and nine answered by letter.
Remarks by Rev. R. F. Lowe, super
intendent of the St. Johnsbury dis
trict; solo, C. B. Webster ; "History oi
the Local Church," Rev. A. B. Blake.
(This will appear in full in the Moni
tor within a few weeks.) The pastor
then calied the district superintendent
and the official members witbin the
chancel while the congregation was
singing, "God Be with You 'till We
Meet Again." Then, to soft music,
the congregation marched ,up the south
aisle, passed in front of the chancel,
shook hands with those standing with
in, passed on down the center, and
went out. It was an occasion which,
we believe, will not soon be forgotten,
and whose influence will be felt
throughout our whole constituency.
