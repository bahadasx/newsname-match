If London, Jan.. 5, 5 : 02 p. m. The British casualties in the
battle of Loos, France, last September, totalled 2,378 officers
I and 57,288 men, according to an anouncement made in the
I : house of commons this afternoon by Harold J. Tennant, parli-
I mentary under-secretary for war.
I London, Jan. 5, 4:23 p. m. The
American embassy here has received
a report saying that the Rev. Homer
R. Salisbury, an American, was a pas
senger on the Peninsular and Orl
'. ' ental liner Persia, which was sunk in
the Mediterranean but that he was
not included among the survivors.
London, Jan. 4, 9:49 p. m. (Delay-
; ed) The Russian campaign in Bea-
' sarabia takes an undeniable first place
;' in the "war news with the announce-
' ment in a news agency dispatch from
Perograd that the Austro-German for-
; ces have evacuated Czernowitz, which
; i had become untenable because of the
' i Russian capture of the heights sur
i . rounding the city.
; ' Czernowitz is undoubtedly a valu
5 : able vantage point Tor a further Rus
sian campaign. The Teutonic forces
5 ! are already deprived of the use of the
i ' Important railway from Czernowitz to
J Zalestchltky, while the line from Czer
I - nowitz to Polomea is seriously mea-
' i aced.
' Gzernowitz has changed hands four
! ' times since the beginning of the war.

London, Jan. 5, 3:46 p. m. Under
I ; the terms of the compulsory military
service bill, introduced in the house
3 of commons today, all males between
; ; the ages of 18 and 41, who are bache-
lors, or widowers without children de
; pendent upon them, are liable for mlli
; tary service.
; Ireland is excluded from the terms
r of the measure.
I Married Men Held Back.
i The bill, Mr. Asquith continued,
was limited specifically to redemption
of the promise he had made publicly
; to married men. This pledge had
been given at a time when overwhelm-
i ing evidence had been submitted to
him that married men who were will-
I Ing and anxious to serve were hold-
V Ing back in large numbers.
They needed to be reassured that,
having regard for their circumstances
I ' and the business they were carrying
on, they could count upon their term
1 of service being postponed until the
. i younger and slugle men had been
called up. Tf assurances had not been
: ; given at that time there would have
; been danger that the whole recruiting
campaign would break down.
"Where then, should we be now?"
The premier added that if he was
to be confronted with the same situa
tion at the present time he would
f take precisely the same course. He
i said he had received no protest
: ' against his pledge.
i Although he has been a strong sup-
porter of the system of voluntary ser
vice, Mr. Asquith declared he was
1 convinced of the necessity of the
i compulsion bill, which ho believed
: would meet with general approval
when its provisions were understood.
I I
Great Crowd to Vote.
London, Jan. 5, 5 p. m. The bill
1 providing for compulsory military ser-
i vice was introduced In the house of
commons today by Premier Asquith.
I The largest assemblage of members
since the war began faced the prem
ier Many members had obtained
leave to return from the front so that
they might be able to vote on the com
pulsion bill.
The Earl of Derby who conducted
tho recruiting campaign was in the
peers' gallery.
No General Compulsion.
Mr. ABqulth said no case had been
made out for general compulsion, and
that the bill he was introducing could
be supported by those opposed to con
scription. Mr. Asquith opened his address with
an analysis of the figures in the Der
by report. He emphasized the fact
that during the Derby campaign near
11 3,000,000 men had offered their ser
vices. Even deducting those rejected
on the ground of physical disability,
the total was still in excess of 2,500,
000. "These are wonderful, encouraging
figures" the premier continued.
People's Hearts in War.
"They ought to convince both our
allies and our enemies that the people
mm 0l this country have their hearts in
I the war."
i l Mr. Asquith said he was unable, aft-
' er making the largest possible hypo-
i! thetlcal deduction, to consider the
$ number of unrecruited single men as
anything but as a substantial, and
k oven considerable amount. He added
H that Sir John Simon, whose resigna
H tlon as home secretary was announced
WX yesterday, thought the figures might
be reduced to an inestimable quan
tity. "If he had shared this view," Mr
Asquith said, "the present contingency
would not have arisen, but he could
not think that. The primary obliga
tion was to keep faith at all costs with
the married men."
Same Exemptions as In Derby Plan.
The prime minister said exemptions
from service could be claimed under
the terms of tho bill on the same
grounds as in the case of men attest
ed under the Derby plan The grounds
of exemption include conscientious ob
jection to performing military service.
Other grounds for exemption from
service, the premier said, included ill
health, physical infirmity, the neces
sity to support dependent persons and
the fact of being engaged on work of
national importance.

PRINCE ANDREW
DESCRIBES RAID
Aerial Bombardment of Allies'
Camps and Replies From
the Warships Astound
Greek Officer.
SEES THREE MACHINES
Bombs Drop With Precision,
Causing Terrific Explosions
German Consulate Of
ficials Under Arrest.
Athens, Jan. 4, via Paris, 9:45 p. m.
Prince Andrew of Greece, brother
of King Constantine in an interview
with a correspondent of the Associat
ed Press, described the aerial bom
bardment of the allies' camp at Zel
tenlik, on the outskirts of Saloniki,
on December 30.
"The bombardment and the reply
of the fleets anchored in the roads
of Saloniki," said the prince, "was
one of the most extraordinary sights
imaginable. I was riding back from
the morning's work with my regiment
at about ten thirty when I was
startled by a deafening explosion
some 200 yards away. A great cloud
of black smoke arose, followed short
ly by three more explosions at regu
lar intervals. Then came the fa
miliar rocket like sound of a shell
passing through the air, evidently
fired by one of the warships in the
harbor.
"Naturally my first thought was
that for some reason the fleet was
bombarding Saloniki. , Therefore 1
rode straight to the nearest British
post which happened to be a hospital
not far from the Greek camp.
" 'Why are you bombarding the
e.itv?' T askpfl tho nffioove.
Sees Three Machines.
"Then for the first time I looked
up and saw three machines fully ,3000
feet high flyljugAfn line from the
northeast and turning just over the
harbor toward the northwest, in
which direction they finally disap
peared "The bombs dropped with the great
est precision one after another, kill
ing and wounding a number of thfe
allies' soldiers but not touching W
city. Meanwhile the firing of the!
fleet grow thunderous. It was 1m
possible to hear yourself think. In a
short time it became evident that
the fire from the fleet was more dan
gerous than the bombs from the aero
planes, as some of the shells, aimed
wild, whistled directly over the town,
one narrowly missing Major Metaxasj
and a troop of Greek cavalry return-j
ing from exercise.
"Pieces of spent shells began to
drop with frightful velocity, one even
piercing two floors of a tram statioft
and burying Itself in the ground cel
lar. The population not understand
ing what it was all about were greatly
excited. )
Fourth Aeroplane Arrives. J
"Toward noon a fourth aeroplane
arrived, following exactly the saiJio
course as the others, though flying
lower. The Black Maltese crosses
were plainly visible on Its wings. My
wife and I watched Its flight from
the balcony of our house.
"Riding home along King Georgo
street towards tea time I was aston
ished to see French soldiers and a
dense crowd of onlookers surround
ing tho German consulate. Farther
along the street other consulates pre
sented the same sight. The consuls
were bustled through the crowd, tak
on to the headquarters of the French
commander. General Sarrail, cross ex
amined and then put aboard the bat
tleship Patrie to the accompaniment
throughout of the stares and com
ments of curious crwods."
Asked whether he would return to
Saloniki, the prince replied:
"Of course I shall. Why shouldn't
I? Despite appearances, Saloniki is
btill Greek."
Italian Receipts Increase.
Rome, Jan. 4, 2 p. m. The Italian
minister of posts and telegraphs re
port receipts during the last six
months of nearly 102,000,000 lire, or
17.500,000 lire more than during the
corresponding period "of 1914.

COL, ROOSEVELT
IS DENOUNCED
Senate Report Scores Former
President for Not Substanti
ating Charges Against
Wilson and Bryan.
STORIES WITHOUT BASIS
Both Majority and Minority
Senate Reports Find Admin
istration Officials Blame
less of Illegal Acts.
V, ".,'"
Washington, Jaiu 5. Charges circu
lated during the last session of con
gress that administration officials act
ed in the interest of foreign business
firms in urging the passage of the
government ship purchase bill, were
held to be baseless In majority and
minority reports filed today by the
senate committee appointed to investi
gate them. Both reports also found
the shipping interests blameless o'f
illegal activity in opposition to tho
measure.
Col. Roosevelt Denounced.
The majority report denounced
Theodore Roosevelt for failing to ap
pear before the committee to testify
concerning his published assertion
that President Wilson and Secretary
Bryan had endeavored in the Interest
of certain foreign business firms to
secure for the United States the pow
er to purchase the interned ships of
one of the belligerents.
This, the majority report said, had
Its origin In "that ungenerous trait of
the human mind which makes it prone
to attribute unworthy motives to re
doubtable rivals and particularly po
litical antagonists."
Made Slanderous Attack.
"The writer." added the report,
"whose eminence was naturally calcu
lated to give weight to his utterances,
finding himself without any basis,
even of a hearsay character, for his
slanderous 'attack upon the highest
officer of his government, simply re
sorted' to a palpable sophistry to es
c?pe the responsibility for the asser
tion he had made "
While the report found that the
piesident harbored no interest to buy
interned ships, the majority held that
it was not difficult to conceive of rea
sons consistent with the most exalted
motives that might induce the presi
dent to refrain from a public declara
tion that belligerents' ships would not
be bought.
'Such an action," said the report,
"would rightly be construed as an
abandonment of our rights, which our
nation has vigorously maintained, to
acquire merchant ships by bona fide
purchase, though a state of war exists
involving the nation under whose flag
they previously sailed."
Sutherland Presents Report.
Senator Sutherland presented the
minority report for himself and Senat
or Penrose. "We do not concur," it
said, "in so far as the report defends
the bill itself, nor in so far as it in
sists there would be impropriety In
the purchase of the belligerents' idle
ships. We believe the bill a thorough
ly bad piece of legislation and are
certain that to have purchased the
boats now seeking security in Ameri
can harbors would have developed ser
ious trouble for the United States."
The committee's investigation was
authorized by a resolution offered by
Senator Burton and amendment by
Senator Williams, directing the in
quiry as to whether the so-called ship
ping trust had maintained a lobby
against the bill.
With reference to criticism of Col
onel Roosevelt, the minority report
said:
'We found ourselves unable to agree
with the strictures with references to
ex-President Roosevelt."

TWO MILLION
MEN DANG BACK
Result of Earl of Derby's Stock
Taking' of United King
dom's Martial Manhood.
IRELAND NOT INCLUDED
While England Debates Com
pulsion, Russia Makes Des
perate Onslaughts on
Enemy.
London, Jan. 4, 12 noon. (Delayed)
The figures of the Earl of Derby's
stock taking of the United Kingdom's
martial manhood show that over two
million men of military age have not
yet offered their services in any form
to the government.
Publication of the figures finds a
cabinet crisis caused by the compul
siou program by no means ended.
The cabinet meeting today (Tuesday)
probably will come to a final decision
and may result in other resigv tlons.
Ireland, which was not incluued in
the Derby plan, also is said to be ex
cluded from the conscription measure
which the premier will Introduce In
the house of commons tomorrow.
Russia Fights England Hangs Back.
While England is still debating the
question of compulsion the Russians'
great conscript armies are making
desperate onslaughts upon the Austro
Germans before Czernowitz, where,
according to Russian officials, ttfe
Russians have ot only repulsed Aus
trian counter attacks northeast of
that city, but themselves are steadi
ly advancing.
The military plans of the central
powers in the Near East are still
veiled in mystery, but reports receiv
ed from French sources are skeptical
in regard to rumors that they are on
the point of resuming the offensive
to Macedonia. According to these re
ports, the central empires have only
13 infantry divisions available for
such service and unless Bulgaria sup
plies the deficiency it would be sheer
madness, French critics believe, for
them to attack the forces of the en
tente in their entranched positions.
And it is said that Bulgaria gives
little indication of volunteering such
aid. According to unofficial reports,
she declines any further assistance
on the ground that she has fulfilled
her bargain by conquering a portion
of Serbia and doing her share toward
opening the road to Constantinople.
Activity In Albania.
In Albania there has been much
apparent activity with relatively small
military results. Perhaps the most
important event in Albania is the dec
laration of war by Essad Pasha
against Austria and Germany. This
irregular chieftain is erratic but an
undisputed military genius with a
large and loyal following and he Is re
ported to be well supplied with guns
and munitions.
England has continued her colonial
warfare with success in Kamerun,
where it is officially reported that
the German base has been occupied
bv British forces. French troops also
are known to be converging upon
Jaunde from the east and southeast
so that the fleeing Germans soon may
be surrounded.

No additional facts beyond the de- H
finite knowledge that only two Amer- H

had been received by the state depart- H
ment overnight from either Arabassa- H
dor Penfield at Vienna, Ambassador H
Gerard at Berlin or American consu- H
lar agents along the shores of the H
Mediterranean. Such information as H
had already been received, however, H
was carefully reviewed by both the H
president and Mr. Lansing. H
There still was every indication that H
no action would be taken pending re- H
ceipt of fuller advices. Whether the H
status of the Persia was changed from H
an unarmed liner to that of a vessel H
which might technically bo classified H
as armed by the fact that she mount- H
ed one gun, is a point which United H
States navy experts will be called H
upon to help determine. H
Official despatches received today' H
from the American consul at Marseil- H
les established that only one American H
is among the missing passengers H
Robert N. McNeely, newly appointed H
American consul at Aden. Charles H. H
Grant, the other American passenger, H
was rescued. H
Senator Stone, chairman of the for- H
eign relations' committee, will confer H
late today with administration lead- H
ers to determine when the committee H
should be called to consider interna- H
tional problems confronting the conn- H
try. Mr. Stone said he would like to H
have the committee meet tomorrow. H
In the senate discussion of the fon H
eign situation did not develop. Sena- H
tor Fall's resolution calling upon Pre H
ident Wilson to inform the senate re- H
garding the character of the govern H
ment in Mexico which the United H
States government has recognized H

today with officials at the foreign of- H
fice concerning the sinking of the JM
steamship Persia. Mr. Gerard is said IH
lo have inquired about the national- H
Ity of the submarine which sank the H
vessel. The German secretary of the H
navy, Admiral Von Tlrpitz, conferred H
with Emperor William on Monday. H
The Rev. Mr. Salisbury's home was H
at Takoma Park, Washington. He H
