' CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS
Vigorously Protests .Because He Had
to Come to New York at His Own
Expense. - ... . f
New York, Jan. 4. William Jennings
Bryan vigorously ' protested today
against : the law of New oYrk state
because he was Required to come here
at his own expense and give testimony
in a suit for libel. . - ,
"I am here under duress,' declared
Mr. Bryan, "because it is the , only
way I can . avoid contempt proceed
ings." Mr. Bryan was examined in an ac
tion brought against a Greek newspaper.-
He was questioned concern
ing the sale by the United States to
Greece of the old battleships Idaho
and Mississippi, but Baid he knew
nothing of the details. He denied that
he gave any secrets of gun fire con
trol to the Greek government or that
while secretary of state he had seen
any letter written to influence him
against Agamemnon Schliemann, for
mer Greek minister to- the United
States. He aso said he had not heard
criticisms alleged to have been made
of him by Schliemann.
According to Mr. 'Bryan, the sale of
the battleships was a matter which
rested entirely with the navy depart
ment. He admitted that gun Are con
trol secrets might have been divulged
by the navy department without his,
knowledge or that -','the state depart
ment might have attended to some
details of routine work without . his
personal knowledge."
The suit is the outgrowth of a
statement in the Greek newspaper that
the plaintiff, Petros P. Tatania, wrote
or caused to be written- a letter with
a view to bringing about ill-feeling be
tween Air. Bryan and the former Greek
minister.
