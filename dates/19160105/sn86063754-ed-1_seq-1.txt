Persia Torpedoed Without
Warning
London, Jan. 2.?Unofficial
dispatches from Cairo say the 1
British steamer Persia sunk on >
Thursday was torpedoed with- i
out warning and sank in five '
minutes. Between 150 and 160
survivors have been landed at
Alexandria, Egypt.
Reuter's Cairo correspondent :
says Robert N. McNeely lost his
life. Charles H. Grant of Boston
was saved.
Details of the sinking of the (
Persia came in slowly today but
such information as was received
made it appear that the number
of persons who escaped in (
the four boats which were put 1
off was larger than was hoped *
when the first news was receiv- '
ed yesterday. The Peninsula & 1
Oriental Company, which owned 1
the Persia announced this morn- 1
ing that 158 survivors had arriv- (
ed at Alexandria. 1
The survivors include the
chief officer, second officer, \
seven engineers, 27 seamen, 63 '
lascars and 59 passengers. A 1
Lloyd's dispatch Rives the num- 4
ber as 155, made up of 59 pas
sengers of whom 17 are women '
and 94 members of die crew in- '
eluding 59 lascars. 1
The survivors ioclude 10 1
military officers and eight persons
who are not British sub- '
jects.
"Survivors say it was litde \
short of a miracle* that anyone ]
was saved.. There was no panic. 1
Four boats were launched with J
the utmost promptitude.

called by Senator Benjamin R.
Tillman of South Carolina:
Some time ago a young man
became very much enamored of
a beautiful girl, and meeting her
at a reception one night, he de- :
termined to know his fate.
"Miss Smith," said he, leading
the beautiful girl amid the glad
palms and seating her on a soft i
sofa, "there is something that I
must ten you, something that i
I?"
"All right, Mr. Jones," interposed
the pretty one, "only you
must hurry. I don't want to
miss the next waltz."
"It is a question that lies near <
to my heart. Miss Smith," continued
the young lover. "Could '
you?do you think you could 1
marry a man like me?"
"Why yes," was the calm re- j
joinder of Miss Smith, "that is, j

The Menace of Mohammedan- A
ism.
One of the greatest enemies of
Christianity is Mohammedanism, oi
and the following facts taken t>
from the World Outlook will be A
of interest: io
Every eighth person in the
world is a Mohammedan. '
From one to five times a day
two hundred million of the hu "
man race turn their faces toward fc
Mecca and repeat the prayer: L
"There is but one God and Ma- ti
hommet is his prophet/' ri
The slogan of the Moslem to ti
day is "Africa for Islam."
Each Moslem trader is a mis- oi
sionary of his faith. Penetrating to
to every nook and corner of the hi
dark continent, he is enlisting ai
new adherents by the hundreds in
of thousands. Mohammedanism p
is spreading three times more hi
rapidly in Africa that is Chris- m
tianity. For every thirty three
natives who become Christian, cc
one hundred become Moham- in
medans. tta
Slavery, polygamy and the th
demoralization of character dur- pi
2 the twelve centuries of Mos h
lem control have made north a
\frica a moral desert. su
Lying is a fine art in Moslem w
lands. Mohammed declares. "A w
lie is allowable in three cases? a/f
to women, to reconcile friends, ec
and in war"' % ^ '
Moslem "hoht* cities** are th
centers of immorality. in
This is the challenge the ju
Christian churches face not only w
in Africa but in southern Eu ic
[Ope, Arabia, Persia, India Ma- pc
laysia and China.

Chesterfield Adfvertll*. r. al
That Chesterfield County has v<
an efficient force of rural police pi
goes without saying. These gen- p1
tlemen are always on the job P
?nd in the performance of their 10
duty, while fearless to a man, 1)1
often exercise a fine sense of _
descrimination where slight offenses
are concerned. These H'
things are well known, but the
year's record as shown on the ^
county's books will probably ?y
prove interesting. c<
Since the organization of this c<
force in place of the former constables,
the entire salaries up to st
Dec. 15th, 1915 amounts to ?<
$8,100. lr

Number of days worked on st

the gang is 60 jcents. This N

Ford Will Not Mist the Money. ^
Concord Times. 3|
The total cost of the Ford ^
peace expedition is estimated at C1
$444,950. This includes the entire
expenses oi* the expedition "
up to the time of Mr. Ford's de- ?'
parture from Christiana, and the
cheek for $270,000 he left behind
to finance the remainder of the
expedition. It is stated by the ^
New York World that the Ford
plant can in less than three days
pay the expenses of the entire e:
peace junket. Mr. Ford, it is S
stated, makes a profit $100 on at
each car. It will, therefore, 11
take 4,450 cars to pay the bill w
The daily output of cars is 1,800 sc
a day. The plant, it tnay be fa
found by a little figuring, can
ry for the expedition in 2 days, r

announces that the submane
commander who torpedoed

The cabled press translation
f the note reached Washington

to account the panic aboard

Vane Richardson, colored,
tvho was sentenced in superior
court in this county in January,
1911, to serve ten years in the
State prison, for murder in the
second degree, has been granted
a conditional pardon by Gover
nor Craig. It will be remembered
that Charles Plyler, white,
and Will Funderburk, George
Mahew and Vane Richardson,
colored, were tried for the mur
der of Carter Parks, in Buford
township, in June, 1910. Plyler
was sentenced to the electric
chair but his sentence was commuted
by Governor Kitchih to
life imprisonment. Funderburk
was sentenced to thirty years,
Mahew to fifteen vears and
Richardson to ten years in the
State prison. All except the
man just pardoned are serving
their terms. Governor Craig
gives as his reason for pardoning
Vane Richardson that the testimony
given by Richardson,

New Liquor Law to Be Enforced
The Stale Saturday.
"With the help of God and the
support of the people this and
all other laws of our great State
shall be rigidly enforced so long
as I am gnvernor." said Gov.
Manning in a New Year's greeting
to the people of South Carolina
yesterday.
The statement follows:
"For the blessings of peace
and prosperity to the people of
South Carolina throughout the
year just ended, we are profoundly
thankful. We have
had our trials and grave problems,
but in meeting and solving
these problems we have been
made stronger and better fitted
to meet the problems of the future.
South Carolinians today,
with all the true potriotism of
their forefathers, stand shoulder
to shoulder a united Deonle ficht
ing for the things that are right
and just for all the people of our
grand old South Carolina.
"With this spirit of union and
co-operation among our people
we may look to the future with
optimism and confidence, meeting
any difficulties that may be
presented and conquering them
as only true patriotic South Carolinians
can do.
"Many problems must be met
during the year 1916. The
death of the dispensary system
after a storm life of 23 years,
aiidiher enactment of a law prohibiting
the sahrof_ alcoholic
liquors, places a responsibility
upon our people that can not be
shirked or thrown off without
grave danger. Law is the result
of the demand of the people,
and the neoole in nrdpr that
| their law be properly enforced,
must siana even closer together
and continue the fight for its
enforcement, upholding and assisting
those officers who are
striving to do their duty without
fear or favor. With the help of
God and the support of the
people this and all other laws
of our great State shall be rigidly
enforced so long as I am
governor.
"Another of our problems is
that of education. A continuance
of the fight for rural and
common school education in
1916 will bring to us a great re

Not Told of Son's Death
Monroe, Jan. 2.?The torpedoins:
of the steamship Persia, with
the probable death of Robert
Ney McNeelv, was the dominant
topic of conversation here today.
Mr. McNeely's relatives,
who live in the country near
here, have been clinging to such
shreds of hope as vague cable
dispatches left them, but absence
of any news whatever of
an optimistic character caused
hope to diminish to almost the
vanishing point.

Ney McNeely on Torpedoed
Ship in Mediterranean Sea
London, Jan 1.?The British
liner Persia with 160 passengers
and a crew of 250 to 300 was
sunk by an unidentified submarine
at 1 o'clock Thursday
afternoon off the Island of Crete
in the eastern Mediterranean.
Messages received from various
sources say that nearly all on
board were lost. Robert Ney
McNeely of Monroe, N. C.,
American Consul at Aden, and
Robert Grant of Boston, were on
the liner.
The crew of the Persia virtually
all were lascars. Four boats
are known to have got away
from the sinking vesssel, each
capable of carrying 60 persons
but it is not known if the boats
were full.
The rescued were picked up
by a steamer bound |for Alexandria,
where they were expected
today.
