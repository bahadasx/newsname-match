World's Supply of Antimony
Tied Up in Celestial
Kingdom.
(By Associated Prfjss)
HANKOW, China, Dcc. 2.?Anti
mony has reached a record price be
cause of the great need ot metal ui
making munitions of war, and Chiu
o.'o, who were far-slghtod enough to
corner antimony output, hav ert-ap
ert a fortune.
The refined metal has been sold in
London for over $600 gold per ton at
times since the opening of the war.
Previous to hostilities the London
price was about $125.
Hunan province, which lies south
of Hankow, is the cbicf antimony pi o
ducting section of tho world. The
ore rom which the metal is obtained,
isblasted there from the hilltops, and
reaches Hankow on rivers which
drain into the Yang-tse. The chief
producer of tho refined ore is the
Hua Cbing Company of Changsha.
Changsha is an Important commercial
center on the Siang river, south of
Hankow. Before the war the output
of the Huang Chang Company's re
finery averaged a little more than two
hundred tons a month, but the plant
has now been extended and the'com
pany has opened offices in New York.
Several plants have now been es
tablished in Hankow for refining
the ore. and this city is probably sup
plying ninety por cent, of the anti
mony used by the munition workers.
Tho metal is necessary in the manu
facture of shells, as it makes the steel
more brittle and caused the shell to
be much more deadly by breaking in
to smaller pieces when it oxplodos.
Antimony is also required in making
armor plate for warships.
Producers of the crude ore have en
joyed only a slight increase in tho
price of their product. Middlemen,
who were able to corner tho output
and wero far-seeing enough to appre
ciate how the prices would rise, have
reaped most of the profit. Practical
ly all the leaders in the movement to
corner the market are Chinoso and
Japanese.

More than 1,200 signers to contracts
for a single-phono system for Fair
mont and vicinity had been secured at
noon..today by the crew ,of Belt tele
plioaecpnvasscrs employed under tho
direction,of H. H. Henderson of Pitts
biirgti, "district commercial agont for
tho Bell company, according to state
ments by Mr. .Hendorsou. Mr. Hen
derson states, that ? the Consolidation
Coal company and other users of ..large
numbers of 'phones 'kre among tho
signers, and that comparatively few
persons have refused to sign.
At the rfcgular monthly meeting of
the hoard of directors of the Business
Men's Association yesterday after
noon at 4 o'clock the question of
whether or not the'association should
authorize its secretary, Trevey Nut
ter, to sign the contract for.the asso
ciation was lnfbrmally discussed.
Objection was raised to the number
of towns within the county included
in the list to which .toll is charged in
addition to the regular rental, Man
nington being one of the cities which
several of the business men asserted
should be Included in the district in
which no tolls are charged. Tho
meeting adjourned without voting to
determine whether or not Mr. Nutter
should sign the new contract. In tho
absenco of instructions Mr. Nutter
says that he will decline to sign for
the association or for himself.
The Suez Canal
Revenues are Cut
ACTIVITIES OF SUBMARINES
PUT A STOP TO NAVIGA
TION THOUGH ST.
(By Associated Press)
? LONDON, Jan. 5.?Tile withdrawal
of the Dutch ? liners from the Suez
Canal to the East Indies, which goes
Into effect January 1, will mean an
other considerable falling oft in tho
revenues of the canal. In 1914 ves
sels of Dutch nationality hold third
place, both as regards numbers and
tonnage. Great Britain was first with
3,000 vessels of 13,000,000 tons; Ger
many came second with 480 vessels
of 2,100,000 tons, and Holland third
with 360 vessels of 1,400,000 tons.
Tho ofcial reason given for the di
version of the Dutch boats Is "the
increasing uncertainty of being ablo
to obtain the necessary coal at tho
apolnted stations" but shipping men
In.Lo'ndon think that the decision was
more likely due to Gorman submarine
activity In the Mediterranean ports,
there Is no shortage in the supply.
The price for January at Port Said
will be about $22 per ton, as compar
ed with $6.50 before the war, but, ow
ing to the withdrawal of many vessels
which used the Suez route In nor
mal times, tho reserves at tho coaling
stations are very large.

Expert Witness So Testified
in Court This Morn
ing.
WHOLE 101 BENEFITS
Interesting Testimony in
Suit Involving Value of
a Quarry.
That the proposed now hotel to be
erected at Jefferson and Washington
strcts at cost of $350,000 has caused
an increase in the value of Fairmont
real estate even in remote residence
sections of the city was indicated to
day by testimony offered by Levi B.
Harr, who qualified as an expert wit- ]
ness on- realty values in the case of j
Ogden Investment company against
George. M. Lilley on trial before Judge
W. S. Hayxnond and a jury in Circuit j
Court.
In estimating the value of three un
improved lots in Ogden avenue alleg- ]
ed to have been damaged by Lilley j
who is said to have encroached on i
property not belonging to him in op
erating a stone quarry. Mr. Harr tes
tilled that the lots in question were
worth $50 each more now than they
were a year ago.
When pressed by the attorneys for I
reasons as to why the values had in
creased Mr. Harr denied that it was
not due to improvements in the im
mediate neighborhood of the lots.
"Well, what caused the increase in
value then?" inquired the attorney.
"The new hotel has^much to do with i
it," was the reply.

Away From Friends to

days ago was a member of tlio job

Sam's naval forces, and will undoubt
edly be avaluable acquisition to pre
paredness campagn that is being so
widely discussed.
Mr. Merrifleld for some time has
had a longing to join the navy, but
owing to the fact that he was unable
to gain the consent of his parents,
he refrained from taking the required
examinations. He passed his sev
enteenth birthday recently and his
mother finally consented to sign the
required papers.
Last Monday Lownle reported for
duty and stated that he had decided
not to Join the navy and would stick
to his work in this city. He disappear

was heard from him until today, when
several of the boys in the,plant receiv

had gone to Pittsburgh, passed the ex

His many friends in Fairmont wlsli

He had been assessed on ten thou

Although six months ot the fiscal
year, which ends June 30, remain few
additional fees for licenses will be

year and only a few new merchants
starting in business or adding new
lines of goods to their stocks take out
licenses during the last half of the
fiscal year.
The aggregate of license fees col
lected In the county has shown a
decided falling off since the Yost pro
hibition law went into effect. Preced
ing the enactment of the Yost law
there were 32 saloons in Marion coun
