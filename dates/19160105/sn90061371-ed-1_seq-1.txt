The prise of gaaoUne has been
mounting by leaps and bounds
lately, the advance in some lo
calities being as high as 100 per
oent over the price a year ago.
The general complaint over this
condition led the government to
make an investigation aa to the
cause of the rise in the price of
this oomaedtty. The result of
this Investigation however ia un
satisfactory. It was found that
the supply jand demand had no
bearing apon tbs increase, vines
the supply of crude oil has not
declined and the general con
sumption showing no marked
Sain. The claim that the foreign
eat and, because of the war, was
ffMfOUiblsfoff Meadvanoo was
refused by the showing Uut the
asportations bad actually fallen
off instead of showing gals.
Titers was also nothing to prove
that the price of a year a?o was
too low to make tbe business
profitable This leaves us the
conclusion that gasoline con
sumers are at the mercy of the
oil monopoly and who are aaain
being hold up for all the traffic
will bear. It gives us addition
al proof of tbe utter foolishness

on part of the American people gg gta m. Essmeyer,
in permitting the great natural
resources upon whose output
the economic welfare of the com
munity is ao largely dependent
to pass out of their control and
given over to exploitation for
private profit. We are thus
made-Uyj ir tiuss fir slipshod
national inefficiency. The .oil
monopiy . is not to blame if it
nibs us as ions as we give it li
c -nso to do so. Another thing,
don't, expect the government to
give you relief fro.u these peri
od io holdups by monopoly as long
as you permit the monopoly to
be the govern men6. The govern
ment gave us no relief from the
exactions of the railroad and
other public utilities, the people
hid to attend to that matter
themselves. They will also hare
to attend to .he oil and similar
monopolies in just the same way
to et the rhrht solution of that
problem. If there U any wis
dom and justice in public control i
over uf? cost oi service oi irie
public utilities then there wocld
be just- 8 much wjidotn and jus
tice ia public control of tho price
oil, since it is evident that oil
prices can be and are controlled
by n private monopoly. The
great lesson we must learn is,
that national efficiency is not best
i pressed in terms of Rockefel
lerian fortunes, but in terms of
the economic prkres gnd so
cial content of the great mass of
tiie people. -"'

We havo given baok to Great
Itritain that freedom and iude
lieudence for wliich the fathers
of oi.r jyuntry fought, bled and
died to achiMVa. And this has
born done with hardly a mututur
nf protest from the American
ix-ople, probably because few of
them are really aware how far
our government hi. gone in this
surrender, for the great datly
papers are peculiarly silent about
the matter to which wo refer,
viz At the seaports of the I'n
ited State British ofripprs-mind
you, British ofneers-are station
ed tosMud guard over and super
vise the shipments from this
country in cssela of neutral
natiujs, which include the ships
of this country. When fheseof
ticors have stiflieiently satisfied
themselves of the nature of these
cargoes and that they contain no
contraband of war, they then
close the hatches of the ships en
dor an official seal, which is the
seal of Great Uritian, of course,
and which must not be tampered
with until the ships have reached
their destination. The Hevlew
of Keviews for January gives a
photo engraving of the scaled
hatches oi sucn a vessel, it is
claimed that thia is necessary
to obviate the inspection of the
cargoes st sea by officers ef
the British warships. N o w,
what do you think of that aa a
surrendered of tbe rights of s
' free and independent" people?
Wnat are we coming to when our
government permits foreign offi
cers to arrogate to tnemseives
such authority within our bord
era: surety tne nones ox ueorge
Washington, Ben Franklin and
tbe rest ef the Revolutionary
heroes must rattle and turn over
at such doings.
