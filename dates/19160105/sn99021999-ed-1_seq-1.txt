KAISER HAS CANCER
OF THROAT, CANNOT
SPEAK, SAYS MATIN
Paris Paper Says that is Reason
German Emperor Did Not
Go to Warsaw, Constan
tinople or Brussels.
REVIVAL OF OLD TROUBLE
Operation Performed Similar to One
Made Ncceisary Four
Years Ago.
SAID TO BE ONLY PALLIATIVE
PARIS, Jan. 4. (Delayed.) The
Matin affirms, notwithstanding de
nials, that the German emperor is
suffering from cancer of lh throat
and is no longer able to speak.
"In February, 1911." a cording to
the Matin, "the doctors were consid
ering whether it was necessary to re
move the entire larynx in ordf-r to
stay the progress of the disease.
They raised the question as to
whether he emperor would be able
to speak if such an opera Ion were
performed.
I.eadlnsr Sperlallnt (nnanltrd.
'The leading specialists of every cap
ital In Europe were consulted. It was
learned that an eminent surgeon of rails
had, with an artificial larynx and a
breathing tube opened Into the trachea,
restored the power of speech to cancer
ous patients who had undergone total
ablation of the affected organs.
'This doctor, whose name the Matin
withholds for reasons of professional
etiquette, was asked to go to Berlin by
the German ambassador. He was offered
100,000 franca and all his exVcnscs and
waa requested" to bring with him a
patient who had been fitted with the
apparatus, so that the emperor himself
might see If he wa sabel to sprak.
Similar Operation Performed,
'Meanwhile, as a result of a minor
operation with a bistoury and a few
weeks' absolute rest, tho emperor's con
dition Improved, as Is often the case In
thla disease, the progress of which Is
Implacable, but slow. It Is another oper
ation of thla kind which haa Just been
performed. But It Is only pallatlve. The
German emperor must either make up
his mind to complete removal of tho
larnyx or b stifled by th growth.
"Thla explains why the emperor went
neither to Warsaw, Constantinople nor
Brussels."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4. An ex

foreign policy and its course in the
ubmar'ne crisis failed to materialise
in the senate today when that body,
after being In session less than ten
minutes, adjourned until noon , to

The reason assigned for the sudden
adjournment by leaders on both

had expected to have business to
present did not have It ready. The
motion on which thesenate ad
Journed, however, was in observance
of the death of Associate Justice
