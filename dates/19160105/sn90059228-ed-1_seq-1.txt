BIGICAMPAIGN TO
RAISE $36,000
North Star College Needs But $13,000
More to Secure Hon. James J.
Hill's Donation.
Strenuous efforts have been made
the past year by North Star College
to solicit funds for paying the indebt
edness of $36,000 that still rests on
the new college building. Kev. F. N.
"Anderson, the financial secretary, has
devoted nearly all his time during the
past summer and fall to the work of
soliciting and he has succeeded in
getting a large aggregate sum sub
scribed by the friends of the institu-
/*flon thruout the valley. But a great
/deal yet remains to be done and only
two months remain in which to raise
.^J^ the total amount of $27,000 that is
^f~ required in order to obtain the $9000
donation promised by Hon. James J.
Hill. On March 1, 1916, the money
must be in the bank, or Mr. Hill's
promised donation may be withdrawn.
The college cannot afford to lose Mr.
Hill's generous offer, and for that
reason all friends of the institution
are asked and importuned to come to
its assistance.
There are 36 sections of land in a
township and the debt of $36,000 may
be represented to the eye as cover
ing an entire township, making an
indebtedness of $1,000 on each of the
36 sections. Mr. James J. Hill wipes
out nine sections of debt, or one
fourth of the whole, at one lick, by
his donation of $9,000. The seven
members of the Board of Trustees,
have agreed to raise or donate $1,000
each, making1
together with Mr. Hill's
\ionation sixteen sections of debt
provided for. Kev. Anderson has
raised about $7,000 in subscriptions,
either collected or promised, making,
together with Mr. Hill's and the
Boards donations, $23,000 in sight at
this time. Only $13,000 still remains
to be raised. Who will be the first
one to come forward with a promise
to remove a section of the debt? or
half a section? or a quarter of a
section Do you not want to be one
'/of those/who have helped to estab-j
lish this college in the^ famous,. Red'
-^B,iver Valley, the "bread basket" of
the world It is not in any fictitious
mining stock or "get-rich-quick-
scheme", that the people are asked
to invest their money, but in an
established institution that is doing
good work and already has been a
blessing and benefit to hundreds of
young men nd young women, who
have goke* th^re to acquire an educa
tion, A,IM| ^prth Star College will
P//stayj'toYtjerp"an benefit the young
ill /peo^Ie'ojJlfchis part of the Northwest,
long affofcr those now living have
(./ft gone, pjpvi^ftd it is given the needed
It assistance ai this time. Good friends,
rally to the Support of North Star
College now^/vghen it needs your aid!
Follow the' good example set by Hon.
James J. Hill. He fully realizes what
North Star College stands for and
what it meaiis for enlightened
citizenship and culture among those
who dweli in this fertile valley.
There are thirteen sections of debt
stiili&s be removed. $1,000 clears one
section l$500^|u half section $250, a
quartertiection or 160 acres $125 re
moves *^e debt from 80 acres $62.50
from 4ty acres $15.63 from 10 acres,
etc.
Remove as many acres of debt as
yau can. A long pull, a hard pull and
a pull altogether, in this the most
prosperous time in the history of the
Northwest, will lift the burden of
debt from the college, and even make
it considerably over subscribed. In
^\this connection it may be stated that
i l$ev. F. N. Anderson, the solicitor,
has not drawn one cent of pay for his
work and travelling expenses, nor
will he ask for any money until all
other debts are paid.
Subscriptions and donations should
be sent to Rev. F. N. Anderson, Fi
nancial Secretary of North Star Col
lege, Warren, Minn., and receipt will
be returned to sender. r,yj^*-*

***A*^U** WIWFIELD SCOTT /HAMMOND S
St. Paul, Dec. 31.The body of Winv'eld Scott Hammond, stricken
governor of Minnesota, is homeward -bound under military escort of the
respective Dixie states through which the, funeral car is passing.
With the body of the governor is but one Minnesotan, James A.
Newell of St. Paul, who made the trip South with the governor. But,
at the body of the dead governor journeys northward, so southward to
meet it speeds a party of Minnesota political leaders who will escort the
remains of the dead executive back to the Minnesota capital.
GOVERNOR UNWARNED OF FATE.
Governor Hammond, entirely unwarned that fate threatened him with
any serious malady, died in his hotel in Clinton, La. Apoplexy, aggrav-
ated by a slight attack of ptomaine poisoning, is given by the Louisiana
physicians as the cause of his death.
The governor, believing himself in splendid health, went South De-
cember 23, just two days before Christmas, with Mr: Nowell, to seek rest,
pleasure and to look over some of his lands and lumber interests'in the
East Feliciana parish, Louisiana. FOUND LYING ON FLOOR.
In the South the governor ate something which disagreed with him
but believed his illness to be but a slight attack of indigestion. Seem-
ingly entirely ^recovered, he stepped into the washroom of his hotel in
Clinton about 9 a. m. Mr. Nowell a moment later heard him groan. Mr.
Nowell burst into the room and found the governor lying on the floor In
a state of collapse.
"Jim," the governor exclaimed, and that was his last word.
He was carried to his room but was dead before doctors reached him.
South Honors Memory.
From that moment the South did
all in its power to honor Minnesota's
dead governor and to express its
sympathy with those who mourn him.
The Clinton lodge of Masons as
sumed temporary charge. Governor
Luther E. Hall of Baton Rouge, some
30 miles away, was notified. The
body was sent to Wilson, IrfL, and
a few hours later started northward
accompanied by Governor Hall, a
Louisiana military escort and more
than 100 Louisiana Masons who, on
first call, laid aside their respective
duties and hurried to the side of their
noted Masonic brother.
Jf This Louisiana did in honor of the
governor of Minnesota and to light
en the burden of Mr. Nowell, the
sole companion of the governor when
he was stricken.
pLf Louisiana's Example Followed, m
^The example set by Louisiana was
followed through the night journey
northward by the other Dixie states.
The Louisiana delegation stayed with
the funeral car until it reached*Vicks
burg, Miss., where Governor Earl
Brewer of Mississippi at the head of
another military escort and with an
other Masonic guard, took over the
duty of escorting northward the body
of the stricken governor of a sister
state.
This same beautiful examplev
ME
of
Southern courtesy was taken up by
Tennessee when the Mississippi es
cort arrived in Memphis to deliver
over the body to the governor of Ten
nessee, who was prepared to provide
It with an escort over the line Into
Kentucky. '*?$ .ft
Minnesota Sends Delegation.
While the South was showing,lis
homage to Minnesota's governor, who
had died practically as a stranger in
a strange land, Minneseta was send
ing a delegation of its most prominent
public officials of both parties to Chi
cago to meet the body.
In fact, the first official act of J. A.
A. Burnquist, after taking the oath of
office as successor to Governor Ham
mond, was to appoint this delegation
to hurry to Chicago to escort the body
of the stricken executive back to the
state capitol.
The party was constituted of Sam
uel D. Works, Carlos N. Boynton, C.
M. Andrist, A. H. Turrittin, J. A. O.
Preus, Julius A. Schmahl, Frank E.
Ford, T. J. McDermott, J. G. Armson,
J. F. Farrell, A. J. Rush, Judge Ira
B. Mills, J. C. Nethaway, Justice Al
bert Schaller, A. L. Sorter and Adjut
ant General Fred B. Wood. f,(
Milton Hammond, the late gover
nor's brother, found himself unable to
make connections at St. Paul with this
party and went direct from St. James,
the governor's home, to Chicago.
The whole state of Minnesota is
striving with poignant regret to com
prehend the news which came over
the wires from the little Louisiana
town, where the noted governor
Minnesota met his death.
Andrist Is Overcome.
St. Paul, Dec. 31.C. M. Andrist,
Governor Hammond's private secre
tary, was almost on the verge of col
lapse during the afternoon ami fin
ally had to be taken to his home in
Minneapolis by friends. He was the
first to receive the news of the death
of the executive and it was some time
before he recovered from the shock.
So intense was his grief that he
had to be led to a couch and in
duced to lie down.
nrcrrrm\/rr DA ^C
The county fathers are having their
annual meeting this week.
The clerks in the Auditor's office
have been busy correcting and mak
ing out the personal property tax
books for the county during the past
several weeks.
Oliver Mattison of the Minneapolis
Bridge Company is transacting busi
ness in behalf of his firm at the court
house to day.
Licenses to wed have been issued
to the following by clerk o'f court
Swanby: Hans Hanson to Helga
Svendsen Nelson A. Lafferier to
Camellia M. Douglas Ingvold
Mickelson to (Pga Johnson.
The County Treasurer and his force
of competent assistants, have been
rushed during the past week sending
out personal property tax statements.
All tax payers should remember that
these taxes are due the first of Jan
uary and must be paid before March
first to avoid a penalty of ten per
cent.
Thfe Warren Sheaf was today mads
the official paper of the county, the
Sheaf's bid for county printing hav
ing been accepted by the board. In
this paper will therefore be published
the official proceedings of the board,
the delinquent tax list, the financial
statement and all legal notices of the
county to be published during the
year.
The Sanatarium Commission is
holding a meeting here today. There
is a proposition on foot to have the
counties of Marshall, Pennington,
Roseau and possibly Red Lake and
Kittson unite in building a tubercul
osis sanatarium at Thief River Falls,
which would be a central point for all
these counties. The five counties
would contribute to the cost of main
tenance, which would not then be
burdensome.
The following parties have received
wolf bounties during the past week:
'W|n. Bock Olof Myrfield Gust
Anderson Erick Hill Elmer Sorum
John Olson{ Alfred Aiten Anton
1 Paulsen ^Helmer Fjordan Jacob
Kai^nfcnV^Gto. E: Bieto 'arid Carl
Holmstromfji The courity^pays a
bounty of $7.50 for each wolf shot
and as there were 12 persons who
put in claims this week the county
paid out $90.
When the county board met on
Monday, it was organized by the
election of A. O. Fladeland as chair
man for the ensuing year, and Char
ley F. Adolphson as vice chairman.
The vote for chairman was as fol
lows: For FladelandRokke, Enge
and Adolphson For Adolphson
Lodoeri and Fladeland. Had Mr.
Adolphson voted for himself he would
have been chairman, but he was too
modest to do that. Adolphson was
then made vice chairman.
Mrs. T. Morck is Dead.
A telegram was received by D.
Farrell yesterday stating that Mrs.
T. Morck had passed away on Mon
day evening at 7:45, at Los Angeles,
California. Mrs. Morck suffered a
a paralytic stroke about three years
ago and since then her health has
been very precarious. Deceased was
married to Mr. Morck in this city
when he was serving as Clerk of
Court of Marshall county. Before
her marriage she served as principal
of the Warren High School, her maid
en name being Clara B. Adams. She
was a fine woman, of strong intellect
uality and, like Mr. Morck, very fond
of music. Many friends in Warren
are grieved to learn of her death.

Dear Friends: 'wO-v" ^",'C V4"
^Having spent two months in Illinois
among my people here I feel there is
not any better place here than out in
Marshall county. ^_-
Weather is very changeable/"* On
Christmas Day we were enjoying
snow and good sleighing, but only for
a short time.' f-\-
New Year's Day was a rainy day,
with sharp lightning and thunder.
To-day is warm, with bright sun
shine. Seems like spring was here
just at present. Many farmers are
not through husking.
Corn here is better than any I have
seen this year anywhere. And at
that it is not sound, grading about
No. four, at the best.
Potatoes-are selling for one dollar
a bushel at the stores.. .Which shows
the advantage we .could have by hav
ing a storage house, in Warren and
ship our potatoes out after the prices
sonp. j*^
With wishes for*a'big crop fit 1916,
I remain,
John S. Anderson.

For New $35,000 High School Build
To be Erected in War
ren This Year.
At the special school election held
on Tuesday evening the proposition
to issue $35,000 bonds for a new High
School building, carried by a vote of
81 in favor of bonds to 9 against.
The school board being provided with
the necessary funds will now proceed
to procure plans and advertise for
bids, so that the work of building
may be commenced early in the
spring. The almost unanimous vote
in favor of the bonds shows how the
people of Warren feel toward the
public schools and the cause of ed
ucation in general.
FARMERS OPPOSE INCREASE.
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 22.The
North Dakota Farmers' Union is op
posed to the further increase of ap
propriations for army and naval pur
poses, and has asked the senators and
members of the house from North
Dakota to oppose any such increase.
First action on this question was
taken at a meeting of the Burleigh
County Farmers' union, which repre
sents the sentiment of the organiza
tion in thjs section of the state.
The union asks that the North
Dakota members of congress work
for the enactment of rural credits, a
law against, gambling in options,
national standards for grain grading
and a national bureau of markets.
Lobeck Comes to Warren.
State Senator E. E. Lobeck of
Alexandria is making an extended
speaking campaign thru ^the north
western part of the state in the in
terests of state-wide prohibition
which will be the paramount issue in
Minnesota politics this year. He will
be in Warren on Monday, Jan. 24th,
where he speaks in North Star.
College at 8 o'clock in the evening, t&
Senator Lobeck introduced^the
.statutory bUl^for statewide .prohjbi^
tion in the State Senate last winter
and made a speech for it which the
Minneapolis Journal declared was the
best speech of the whole legislative
session. The bill failed of passage
last year, but with the election of a
new house this year to show the
sentiment of the people of the state
on the subject of statewide prohibi
tion, it is hoped that enough senators
will want to represent the will of the
people to vote for its passage next
winter.
It isn't the first time that Senator
Lobeck has had to introduce a bill
twice before he could secure its pas
sage. While serving his first term in
the House, eight years ago, he intro
duced two bills against white slave
traffic, both of which were buried in
committees. Mr. Lobeck then took
the stump between sessions and when
he was re-elected to the next House,
he again introduced these two bills
which are now amongst the laws of
the state.
Senator Lobeck's platform ability
is so well known all over this state,
that the mere announcement that he
is to speak here insures a crowded
house.
Mr. T. E. Moulton, of March
ing, has been seriously ill
pneumonia, but we learn this
noon that his condition is now
VS
Sid-
with
after-
verf
much improved. His son Charley
Moulton, of Orgon City, Ore., and his
daughter, Mrs. E. B. Pelland, ac
companied by her husband and baby,
arrived Monday, to be at the bedside
of their father.
Mr. A. P. Mclntyre royally" enter
tained about thirty of his gentlemen
friends in his new home in this city
on Wednesday evening of last week*
The evening was delightfully spent
at cards, smoking and having an all
