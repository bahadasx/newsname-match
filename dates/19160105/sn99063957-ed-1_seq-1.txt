Says Teuton Allies Could Make Peace Next Week Bt e
Allies Do Not Desire It "It Will Be a Long, Long '
Russians Are Crowding Austrians Back and May & 3
Occupy Czernavitz, If Tliis Has Not Already Happen
Russian Bombardment of Place Is Terrific
By Carl W; Ackerman,
(United Pi-ess Staff Correspondent.)
Budapest, Jan. 1. (Delayed) A great offensive by
the allies on all fronts in the spring is expected by the
Teutons. Hungarian officials, however, are certain that
the move will meet with defeat.
"The allies fail to take into account our military posi
tion, however," said Count Andrassy today to the United
Press. "We are situated so that we can help each other.
JVe can send men and resources to any front at any time.
We can concentrate something that the enemy cannot.
This makes our victory certain, because it overbalances
our opponents' resources."
Contrary to Berlin opinion, the Hungarians believe that
there will be no early peace.
"It thinks it will be a long, long war," continued the
count. There is no chance of peace in sight at present.
We could jnake peace next week but the allies do not de
sire it; they are not yet convinced of our superiority.
"But the world is becoming hysterical. Even neutral
nations are impatient. It is a shame for humanity that
we can't make peace now."
The count expressed admiration for the manner in
which King Cpnstantine has handled the Greek situation.
"He will keep his nation neutral and save her from the
disaster that wrecked Belgium and Serbia,'' said the
count. "Greece will increase her territory without
sacrificing men and money, and without risking her
future. No one can say that King Constantine is traitor
ous." , He predicted success for Teuton arms in Mesopotamia.
"I see that the English were forced to withdraw from
Bagdad," he commented. "And when the Turks bring up
reinforcements, the British will lose what they now hold
of Mesopotamia, and presently the Suez canal will be in
danger.

Tight Over Conscription.
London. Jnn. B. The battle over con
scription which may mean a new crisis
in Great Britnin's domestic affairs
opened in parliament today. Premier
Asquith was prepared to introduce the
government's conscription bill, and It
was expected lie would expose the fail
ure of the voluntary enlistment plan
and anticipate tho arguments of the
conscription opponents. Kitchener was
expected to do likewise in the house of
lords.
Sir John Simon's explanation of his
resignation from the cabinet it was an
ticipated would be the signal for at
tacks on tho government measure, for
ho is generally supposed to have quit
because of tho compulsory service
plans.
It was understood that the bill ex

Expert Points Out Possibility
of United States Facing
Both Soon
By J. W. T. Mason.
New York, Jan. 5. A warning to
America to prepare for a probable con
flict with Japan is given by Lord
Northcliffe today in his copyright arti
cle written for tho United Press when
he points outthat America's wealth and
defenselosBness will inevitably per
suade some ono to come anil take what
they want.
Outwardly he veils his warning by
suggesting the ''Laplanders" will be
the invaders, but he reveals his inner
meaning by the suggestion that "you
can change tho words as you choose"
aud by describing an invasion of the
Pacific coast,
Tho seriousness of his warning is em
phasized by the possibility of a Teuton
Japanese understanding after the war.
Such a situation-may be forecasted by
the fact that German prisoners are be
ing favored in Japan, while it is re
ported from Tokio that tho Nipponese
will not block the kaiser's efforts
after the war to regain Germany's
lost prestige in China.
Don't Like the Alliance.
Moreover, there is a growing dis
satisfaction in Great Britain over the
British allance with Japan. Canada,
Australia and New Zoaland are hos
tile to Oriental intimacies of John Bull,
and these portions of the British, em
pire are destined to have a wider in
fluence in international politics than
they havo had heretofore. They op
pose future pledges of British support
to Japan In caso sno is invoivcu in
war.
This colonial disapproval is probably
the reason why Great Britain does not
sanction having the Japanese fight
with tho othor allies in fcnrope.
The colonics doubtless will favor an
understanding with America over
Japan, and Lord Northcliffo has prob-
ablv sensed me lociing oi ureal uim
on this point.
His warninor mnv well bo cryptic
prophecy that Japan and Gormany will
be found together in a new alliance in
the future, with tho United States as
their common enemy. Then America
mitrhl hnvo to rclv on Great Britain
for support. Indeed, it would be in
evitably necessary u sucn n i-unumiu-tion

the Altantic and Tariffo coasts and
caught America unprepared.
CONSCRIPTION BILL
London. Jan. C 111 Introducing the
government's conscription bill in the
house of commons today, Premier As
quith declared England does not plan
to draft all men of military age at
present.
"liesults of Lord Derby's enlistment
campaign show that tho cuso lor pen
eral compulsion is not yet proven," hi!
declared.
Ireland, Asquith announced, Is ex
cluded from tho provisions of the con
scription bill. This step was taken to
avoid the opposition of Irish leaders.
Tho bill drafts' ull singlo men be

New York, Jnn. 0. In a very active

Washington, Jan. si-Unlcss it is ma

today.
Senate Leader Kern's dofection from
the ranks of supporters furnished final
proof of this to the White House. He
has balked at the program because be
held that his Indiana constituents are
opposed to it.
This leaves the program unsupported
by the leadors of both houses. Majority
Leader Kitchin of the house held off
from tho first and announced ho could
not give his aid to tho program, but
Kern was expected to lead tno adminis
tration fight in the Benate.
The preparedness sentiment which
swept the country several weeks ago
has reached its cresti some leadors

receiving discouraging reports of the
situation.

AUSTRIAN SITUATION
STEADIL Y IMPROVING
OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC
Washington, Jan. 5. President Wil
son called Secretary of Stnto Lansing
into conference regarding the interna
tional situation nrising from tho Per
sia case, shortly before 1 o'clock to
day. At the conclusion of nearly nn hour's
session, I.aniiing suid that tho country
is still "waiting for tho facts" in the
Persia case.
The secretary hoped that Ambassador
Penfield at Vienna would bo nblo to
enlighten the administration within a
day on the details of tho caso.
Indications were that a certain tlmo
will be given for informal inquiries at
Vienna, and if theso develop nothing,
specific requests will bo mado on Aus
tria to aid tho administration in deter
mining the nationality of the submarine
which attacked tho Persia. That it waa
Austrian, however, was tho general im
pression, inasmuch as only Austrinn
submarines are reported to have been
operating In the Mediterranean where
tho Persia met its fate.
As far as other negotiations between
Austria ami America are concerned, all
evidence indicated that the situation is
clearing.
Lansing said that probably no further
note will be sent to Austria In tho An
cona case. This indicates that the loose
ends iu that situation will bo settled in
conferences with Charge d' Affuircs
Zwiedniek.
If it is finally found that an Austrian
diver wink the' Persia there in a strong
indication that the fact that tho liner
carried a gun will be tho main bono
of contention. Lnnslng said in this con
nection that naval authorities will prob
ably be asked to determine the
efficacy of the Persia's 4.7 inch gun.
with a view to showing whether its
presence wns sufficient excuse for an
unwarranted attack.
The secretary denied that tho gov
ernment is considering a note to Austria.-
With regard to a report thnt the
administration would warn not to travel
on armed niercliBntment, ho declared
that it had not '"'cn discussed.

Tho tension which marked tlio Una-

Delay in any action from Austria was
ascribed to the inubilily of tho com

Terms as Offered .
(By IT. P. Staff Correspondent.)
Petrograd, Jan. 5. Watchful wait
ing, that woll known Amorican policy
regarding Mexico some months ago,
sums up the war situation in Russia to
day, but watchful waiting in liussia
has a meaning nil its own.
Whereas Undo Sam, after experi
encing a few pin-pricks in his patienco,
remained passive( the great Russian
bear after sustaining a healthy, life
sized wallop on liia tender snout let out
a roar that shook the earth continents
away. Reduced to plain English the
roar was:
"Give mo munitions; I've got
enough men."
That was several months ago. Rus
sia's greatest arsenal, near Potrograd,
had been blown to smithereenB; the
armies of Grand Duke Nic'aolns, yield
ing to the Austro-Gcrman steam roller,
had been driven from the Carpathians
back into Russia and had lost Warsaw
and the whole of Polnnd; there was
political dissension In Russia; alarming
semi-revolutionary outbreak were oc
curring here and there; the ever ad
vancing enemy was threatening even
Moscow, and the greatest seaport In
the Bnltic, Riga, appeared to be about
to fall.
Bear Not Hibernating.
In winter benrs usually hibornntn,
but all these tilings nnd more which
happened to tho Russian bear in tho
summer and full of 11115 precluded any
idea of his going Into winter quarters
this year. Russia is today the most
active winter bear extant.
Russia has now mobilized her indus
tries and shells and other munitions in
great quantities have begun to flow
I'rom the factories and shops in every
important Russian city; tho Russian
cnbinet has boon reformed with partic
ular reference to a more active conduct
of tho war; tho peasants who used to
drink vodka have bocomo used to a
vodknless Russia ami are putting their
prof ita from vodkalosa harvests-honc.o
bigger harvests into the provincial
banks; Grnnd Duke Nicholas lias been
suporscded by tho Czar as coiumandor-in-chief
and hns taken hold of the im
portant campaign in the Caucasus.
Stirred to renewed vigor under its rul
er, tho army has used tho shells born
of the industrial mobilization and re
pulsed the enemy in the vicinity ot
Itign, besides putting him on tho de
fensive elsewhere.
Munitions Pouring In.
These and many moro things have
happened in Russia since tho double
en Hie wlincKca too near on tno snout.
Tho roar for munitions which tho bear
let out soon reached Japan, Enulnnd
aud America, and l'ur tho last throo
mouths rifles, shells and cannon have

ARMY
Troops at Beginning of Year-
only lacked the arms wherewith to Join
the armies now preparing for Russia'
future campaign.
With the beginning of the new year
various estimates placed the number of
fresh-armed Russian troops at five mil
lion. At least two million more are be
ing armed at the rate of over half a.
million a month. An additional million
of twenty-year-old youths were culled
upon December 4. There will take their
places in the ranks early In the year.
Twelve Million Soldiers.
Russia's veterans already holding
the battle-line from Riga to the Black
Boa and operating in the Caucasus ara
estimated to total at least 4,WM),tWt),
all hardy fighters, making the total of.
Russian military strength in sight ap
proximately twelve million men.
- Like England, France and Ituly, Rus
sia is preparing to fight in the Bal
kans. This campaign, which ia already
under way, is under tho leadership ot
General Diniitrieff, ex-commander of
tho Ninth Bulgarian army, who re
nounced Czar Ferdinand and Bulgaria,
and sent back the military deeorationa
tendored him by his former sovereign.
Dimitrieff ' first objective ia Bulgar
ia, anticipation of which early in De
cember sent Austro-Gorman and Bul
garian regiments hastily to RustrhuU,
the nearest Bulgarian city to the Rus
sian border. i
it was Russia that delivered Bulgar
ia from the Turkish yoke. When faced
bv the Russians as a foe, led by a fornt
er popular general of the Bulgarian
army, wholesale desertions from the
Bulgar forces are considered a potent
possibility. . .. .
Has Million FrlKOiwra.
Russian forces too, have been sut
in ample numbers to the Caucasus in
ordor, if necessary, to lend aid to the
Uritinh in the event the Sue Canal
should be seriously threatened by the
reinforced tlcrman-lea Turns.
Though Russia has lost an estimated
million and a half prisoners to tier-
many nnd Austria, neanv a million .
men of tho double enemy have been
captured and sent to Hiberia where
they are in no danger of liberation, a
are the Russian prisoners in uormauy
and Austria. Tho Austro-German loss
es during tho Inst three montis, on
the Russian front, have been enormous.
Russia s own losses havo not sieen
slight, but they are. undoubtedly far
under those of the enemy, most of
whose fighting has been offensive. The
activities of (Jenoral Ivanoff in East
ern Gnlicia during September, October
nnd November nro credited with put
ting 200,0011 of the enemy out of U
fight.
Plans General Offensive.
Optimism hns now taken the place of
tho possimisni that prevailed in Rus
sia during tho dark days of the sum
mer. Tim man on tho htroet iu Petro
grad knows as woll as tho highest of
ficial that Russia plans an offensive
against Ocrmnny ami Austria in the
spring of HMU tho liko of wiiich the
world has never experienced. Perhaps
it will come sooner, Whether the ex
penditure of vnst quantities of ammuni
tion on the front, starting in Novem
ber and continuing through Doromber,
is preparation for an advance curlier
than March, or just a mensure to keen
tho Germans from digging in ami pro
tecting themselves ngnirjst tho intense
cold of a Russian winter is not quite
clonr.
Russia generally Is watchful waiting,
but it takes no clairvoyant to forecast
that tho animal that confronts tho Ger
