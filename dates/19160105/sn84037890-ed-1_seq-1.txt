ASTRONOMER CONTENDS
Washington, Jan. 1. Taking a
Ping at Prof. Lowell's Martian Carol
theory. Dr. John A. Brashear, a
Pittsburg astronomer, to-day said at
a sectional meeting of the Pnn
.Amerlcan Scientific Congress, that if
any planet was inhabited it was Ve
nus, and not Mars.
Holding that tho rarity of the at
mosphere made Mars uninhabitable,
Brashear said the atmosphere of Ve
nus was as dense now as that of the
earth In prehistoric times, when life
in all forms was richest.
"If It Is true that the so-called ca
nals of Mars are 275,000 miles long
they must bo 10 mllcswldo and 12
deep," said Brashear. "Since our
little ditch at Panama cost somo
$325,000,000, what a bank account
those Martians must havo, according
to the theory."

AUSTRIA'S REPLY
MEETS DEMANDS
Of
Washington In
Ancona Case.
the
ASSURANCES FOR THE FUTURE
Held By Washington More
Satisfactory Than Those
Of Germany.
DANGER OK RUPTURE PASSED
Washington, Jan. 1. Austria's
reply to tho Ancona note not only
meets the cardinal points of the
American demands, but gives assur
ances for the future, which are con
sidered more satisfactory in their
extent than those which were given
by Germany.
The full American official view
will not be known until after PresI
dent .Wilson has studied the Aus
trian reply, which was received from
Ambassador Penfield and was imme
diately dispatched to Hot Springs by
a White House messenger.
It may be stated authoritatively,
nevertheless, that danger of a rup
ture of diplomatic relations has
passed, and tho controversy now en
ters the samo stage as the Lusltanla
negotiations with Germany, on even
a more favorable basis.
Austria In thcAncona casehas sub
scribed to the principle that no ships
will bo sunk, unless they offer re
Bistence or flee, without the persons
aboard being brought to safety. This
Is considered an assurance that Is
far reaching and satisfactory.
Germany only promised not to at
tack "liners" until the persons
nboard had been' placed in boats.
Theextentof the designation "liners'
never has been cleared up and the
Ampilcan Government does not con-
ccdoYiat- p!aclng. porsone. in.. boats)
necessarily assures their safety.
Points, which Austria leaves for
further diplomatic correspondence
are not considered of a nature to
bring on a new crisis. Chief among
them are questions of fact which af
fect Austria's responsibility for what
happened before the submarine
commander torpedoed tho Ancona,
and their Importance Is minimized
by the promise to pay Indemnity for
Americans lost regardless of tho ab
sence of proof as to Just how they
met their death.
Tho mere statement that tho sub
marine commander has been punish
ed for not making allowances for
tho panic on tho ship undoubtedly
will bo accepted without question
and without further Inquiry as to
Its nature.

The decision gives the 'members

In handing down the decision
Judgo Hudson hold as naught a di

that their divorces must bo granted

END OF EUROPEAN WAR

London, Dec. 31. The last ..day

WOUNDED SOLDIERS ARE
SLEEPING UNDER WATER
Cambridge, Eng., Jan. 1. A wnrdi
In which the patients sleep on imlat'
ed rubber mattresses half submerg
ed in tubs iilled with warm water is
the latest feature of the famous
open-air military hospital located
here.
It was found that many of the pa
tients arriving at the hospital had
such terrible wounds that they were
unable to bear the pain, and as the
constant administration of opiates
retarded thelt progress, It was de
cided by Colonel Griffiths to provide
a bath ward where tho bad cases
could spend their entire time in thp
water. The water, which is kept
flowing through tho tub, is main
tained at a temperature of 100 de
grees. By a system of slings the patient
lies on a rubber mattress with his
entire body under water, only his
head showing above the level of the
bath. A casual observer passing

Ono patient, whose thigh had
been ripped away by a shell, hns

during his sojourn in the water ho
had not felt anything worso than tho
usual discomfort from long confine
