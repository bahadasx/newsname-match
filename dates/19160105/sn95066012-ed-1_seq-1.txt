PRESIDENT MAS TO
AWAIT FURTHER
PERSIA FACTS
It Is Barely Possible That the Ship
, Was Not Torpedoed
NONE ON BOARD SAW SUSMARItF
In Previous Cases When Sinking Has
Been by Daylight the Submarine
Was Always Visible.
Washington, Jan. 5. President Wil
son Is waiting for the full facts be
fore acting on the sinking of the Per
sia, but is prepared to act promptly
once the truth is known.
Tho London announcement that
the Ceelong was not torpedoed but
was sunk in collision wlrli another
ship has hud a tendency to make of
ficial statements cautious lest it turn
out that the Persia tragedy was not
due to a submarine.
Charles Grant of Boston, an Ameri
can passenger, who was saved, does
not mention a torpedo in his interview-
given the associated press. He
says in part
"The saloon became filled with
smoke, broken glass, and steam from
the boilers, which appeared to have
burst.''
Heretofore whenever a ship has
been torpedoed in broad daylight
some of those on board have seen the
submarine, but no one on the Persia,
so far as reported, saw an undersea
craft.
These facts have made it necessary
to await later details qvca though
there Is general conviction that the
sinking was the work or an Austrian
submarine.
STUDENT HANGS HIMSELF
Overstudy Thought to Have Affected
Mind of Elbert Jepson.
After worrying Tor three days over
the whereabouts of his missing son,
Elbert Jepson. l!i. a Princeton stu
dent, George I'. Jepson, a prosperous
fanner of Stamford, found the body
of the youns; man hanging t.-om a raf
ter in the attic of his homo Friday
night. Overstudy is thought to have
affected his mind.
The young man had been at U10
home of his father for the holiday a
caticn since December 2:i and left no
clew that would indicate a reason for
his ad. The news of the suieid? was
a great shock to the people of Stam
ford, where the family is very well
known anil the father is rated as a
prosperous farmer.
The dead man was born in Stam
ford and hail always lived in that
town. He graduated from Drury high
school in North Adams in the class of
1914 and tho same year entered
Princeton, where lie was taking the
collegiate course. He made a name
for himself as a student at Princeton
and won a scholarship for his high
standing. It was his ambition to be a
prcfesior of languages and he was
studying hard to attain this position.
No reason for his deed is known oth
er than lie suffered from the effects
of overstudy. He had complained to
members of the family that he was
troubled by frightful dreams of the
European war for some time past and
this condition is thought to have been
the forerunner of the unbalancing of
his mind which caused him to take
his life. He left no note or message
of any kind as far as has been discov
ered. He is survived by his father, a step
mother, six brothers. Andrew F., Mar
shall, Robert and Norris of Stamford.
Chauncey of Owen. Wis., and George
of Waiiconda, 111., and two sisters,
Mrs. Harry Blood and Mrs. Arthur E.
Dunn, both of Stamford.

Hurying Reinforcements Forward
London, Jan. 5. The Russians have
driven the Austrians across the Pruth
river according to dispatches receiv
ed from Bucher-cst. Dispatches re
ceived here do not confirm the rejiort
from Petrograd that tho Russians
have taken Czernowitz, the Bukowina
capital. A disputed received by tho
way of he Hague states that the Aus
trians have been sending reinforce
ments and that civilians have been
ordered to leave the city.
. London, Wednesday, Jan. 5. A
Keuter dispatch from Petrograd says
that the Teutonic forces are reported
to have, evacuated Czernowitz, (the
capital of Bukowina). It adds that a
large number of prisoners have been
taken, including many Germans.
The Petrograd correspondent of
the Paris I lavas agency also announc

Czernowitz, the Russians lu.ving

day, the officers of King Peter's suite
at Saloniki slate that the Serbian
forces concentrated in Albania, not

number 100,000.
"These forces," adds the dispatch,
are almost completely reorganized
and will shortly be amply provided
with uniforms, artillery and horses.
No decision lias yet been reached as
to how those forces will be utilized."
King Peter, who Is stopping at the
Serbian Consulate in Saloniki, is ex
pected to preside over the reorganiza
tion of the Serbian forces there, ac
cording to a Saloniki dispatch to the
Havas Agency. An army is gradual

Will Not Accept Nominations By

ISSUES PROHIBITIVE ORDER
Admirers of Former President Had
Made Filings fop Two Nomi
nations in Michigan.
New York, Jan. 5. If Colonel
Roosevelt is seeking, the Republican
nomination for President, as a number
of politicians have asserted, he is at
least determined not to permit his
name to appear on the ballots in any
of the States where delegates to tho
national conventions aro chosen at
the primaries. This order will apply
to the ticket submitted by the Pro
gressive Party as well.
That much was settled definitely
yesterday,'.vhen the Colonel sent a
letter from Oyster Bay to tho office of
Secretary of Stato Vaughan at Lans
ing, Mich., requesting him to seo to
It that his name was not placed .on
the ballot as the candidate of any par
ty. He had received a message from
Mr. Vaughan informing him that his
adherents In both tho Republican and
Progressive parties had filed a suffi
cient number of names to put his Uafc
in the ring.
As soon us this letr was sent, tho
announcement was permitted to go
out that Colonel Roosevelt would not
