President Wilson Takes Steps
Designed to Ascertain as
Speedily as Possible Facts
in the Case; Wants to
Know if Vessel Was Ac
tually Torpedoed and by
Whom
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Jan. 5. Presi- j
dent Wilson conferred with Secretary
Eanslng for an hour to-day over the
submarine crisis. No additional facts j
beyond the definite knowledge that
only two Americans were aboard the
liner Persia, had been received by the
State Department over night from
either Ambassador Penfield at
Vienna, Ambassador Gerard at Berlin
or American Consular agents along
the shores of the Mediterranean. Such
information as had already been re
ceived. however, was carefully re
viewed by both the President and Mr.
Lansing.
There still was every indication, no
action would lie taken pending tlie
receipt of fuller advices. Whether
the status of the Persia was changed
from an unarmed liner to that of a
vessel which might technically be
classified as armed by the fact that
she mounted one gun, is a point
which I'nited States Navy experts will
bo called upon to help determine.
They will be asked for advice on how
0% the liner's one gun might have been
used. Meager dispatches have failed
to indicate whether the gun \fras
mounted for defense or offense.
Official dispatches received to-day
established that only one American
is among the missing passengers,
Robert N. McNeely, newly appointed
American consul at Aden. Charles
H. Grant, the other American pas
senger, was rescued.

Three Americans Held in
Austria by New Regulation
Vienna, Jan. 3, via London, Jan. 5.
The American embassy announces that
on account of the new German pass
port regulations three Americans thus
far have found it impossible to go
from Austria to Germany.
Ambassador Penfield has called this
matter to the attention of Washington
because the regulations involve hard
ships upon Americans who hold pass
ports but are unaware that certificates
of birth and nationalization also are
demanded.

New Factory Will Be Opened
in February For Manufac
ture of Soft Goods
Halifax, Pa., Jan. s.—"Bright pros
pects for the future" is the forecast of
the owners of industrial plants in Hali
fax and their prophesy is putting the
borough's residents in good mood.
Although all of the industries here
are not as rushed with orders as some
plants in' other towns, it must be said
that when hard times existed a year
or so ago manufacturing places here
were struck just the least bit harder
than those in some other towns.
Hence, it can readily be seen that in
dustries of Halifax would require a
larger period to recover.

The war in Europe is undoubtedly

Rumored Attempt to
Blow Up Steelton Mills
An attempt was made several nights
ago to bring explosives to the Penn
sylvania Steel Company mills with the
intention of blowing up parts of the
plant supposed to be used in manufac
turing war supplies and shrapnel, ac
cording to rumors affoat in parts of
Steelton to-day.
Several men in a boat landed, the
story goes, late at night near the mills
said to be used in turning out war
munitions. Before they were discov
ered by a steel company officer, ac
cording to the story, part of the explo
sives had been landed. When ques
tioned the men fired several shots, it is
declared, reloaded the boat and dis
appeared down the river. No trace of
them has been found, it is reported.
A patrol of steel company otllcers
has been established along the section
of the plant where the landing was
said to have been made, it was said
unofficially to-day. Steel company oftl
cvrs will probably be given the right
to arrest suspects 011 the property of
the Pennsylvania Railroad surround
ing the Steelton plant, it is said.
Charles K. Holton, secretary to the
vice-president of the steel company,
said this afternoon, that nothing had
been reported to him of the affair,
and that he had heard nothing about
it. He also said that had any such
an attempt been made he would have
learned of it immediately.

ANOTHER RIPPLE
IN NEW COUNCIL
Harmony of New Body Again
to Be Disturbed Municipal
Circles Believes
Will the question of who's to lie as
sistant tire chief disturb the apparent
harmony of Harrisburg's brand-new
City Council that moved along without
a ripple yesterday in approving Mayor
Meals' recommendations for police ap
pointments?
City circles asked that question to
day when it became Known that eoun
eilmanic waters are likely to lie Jrou
liled again before long—and troubled
in a new way.
Whether the disturbance will occur
at the next meeting or whether it will
not be due before January IS is a mat
|ter of conjecture. It is then that
Park Commissioner E. 'A. Gross will
present the name of V. Grant Korrer
(as working head of his department.
An assistant tire chief will also be
named at that time— perhaps.
The Assistant Fire Chief?
Mr. Gross, it is understood wants
Forrer; he also wants Marion Verbeke
assistant to Superintendent Gorgas to
lie assistant fire chief as a successor
to Halbert. Mr. Lynch lias always
been friendly to Mr. Verbeke: likewise
Mr. l,ynch and Mr. Bowman have been
bosom friend—especially of late. But
Mr. Bowman wants Millard Tawney.of
the Itoyal Fire company, for the place.
As for Mayor Meals it is said that he
doesn't care who Rets the position, al
t hough friends believed ho is more or
less for Halbert. The political dope
sters in city circles are trying to figure
out now —us they keep carefully in
mind how the whole Council "went
along" for Harry F. Oves, Bowman's
candidate for treasurer —how the rip
ple may be smoothed.
\ml Assessor. Too
Mr. Bowman, it is said, doesn't
think Verbeke should hold any more
positions. He is clerk to the fire de
partment, clerk to tlie superintendent
of finance and clerk to the jury com
missioners. Mr. Bowman's main oh
jecl ion to Mr. Verbeke, it is under
stood, Is the possible interference with
clerical work if lie be chosen assist
ant fire chief.
The assessorship problem is still a
cause of agitation. James B. Deshong'
says ho doesn't want the $2,000 ,job;
Joseph Cook is still in the ring with
the backing, it is said, of both Qor
gas and Gross: Lynch, Bowman and
Mayor Meals decline to discuss any
candidates. And rumor persists in
connecting C. H. Townsend and Hor
ace Chayne, assessor :ind assistant as
the most likely candidates for the
job.
Lloyd-George Says Task
of Turning Out Munitions
Is Becoming Serious
By Associated Press
London. Jan. 4, 10:50 A. M.—The
House of Commons to-day passed a
bill designed to facilitate the output
of munitions. The bill is in the form
of an amendment to the munitions
act.
In appealing for the passage of the
measure, David l.loyil-George, minis
ter of munitions, siild:
"I hope the commons will not ren
der more difficult the task of turning
out munitions--a task more serious
than T dare tell. Everything depends
upon it. The length of the war de
pends upon it. Everything depends
upon whether we turn out munitions
in sufficient quantities to bring the
campaign to an end this year.
"That does not depend on the sol
diers, who have done their task hero
ically. It depends entirely upon—X
say it in all solemnity—the workmen
of this country."

SINKING VESSEL
CALLS FOR HELP
Thessaloniki Slill Afloat, but
Crew Wants to Be
Taken Off
By Associated Press
New York, Jan. s.—The Greek
steamer, the Salonikl, was still afloat
to-day and sending urgent calls for
help. A wireless message received by
the Scandinavian-American Dine from
Captain Gootsche, of the steamship
United States brought this informa
tion and also denied a belief that the
crippled steamer had been entirely
abandoned and that the captain and
crew had been picked up by the
United States.
Captain Oeotsehc's message said:
"Have searched with full speed all
night over vast areas around the five
positions eighty miles apart without
result, yet at 7 a. m. I will continue
the search. Doing my nest. The cap
tain of the Saloniki sends urgent mes
sages claiming that his engines, boiler
rooms and bunkers are flooded with
only little provisions left."
Report Cancer of Kaiser
So Serious That He Is
Now Unable to Speak
Paris, Jan. s.—The Matin affirms,
notwithstanding denials, that the Ger
man emperor is suffering from cancer
of t.hg throat and is no longer able to
talk.
"lit February, 1911," according to
the Matin, "the doctors were consider
ing whether H was necessary to re
more the entire larynx in order to
stay the progress of the disease. They
raised the question as to whether the
emperor would be able to speak if
such an operation were performed.
The leading specialists of every capital
in Europe were consulted. It was
learned that an eminent surgeon of
Paris ha'l. with an artificial larynx and
a breathing tube opening into the
trachea, restored the power of speech
to numerous patinntr. who had under
gone total oblation of the affected
organ.
"Thin doctor, vvlio.il> name the Matin
withholds for reasons of professional
etiquette, wan risked to go to Berlin by
the Germ nr. ambassador. He was of
fered 100,000 francs ($20,000) and all
his expenses, and was requested to
bring with him a patient who had
heen lilted with tiie apparatus, so that
the emperor himself might. learn if he
was able to speak.
"Meanwhile, as a result of a minor
operation with a bistoury and a few
weeks' absolute rest, the emperor's
condition improved, as is often the
case in this disease, the progress of
which is implacable but slow. It is
niotlier operation of this kind which
has just been performed. But it is
only palliative. The German emperor
must either make up his inind to com
plete removal of the larynx or be
stifled by the growth.
"This explains why the emperor
went neither *n Warsaw, Constanti
nople nor Brussels."
BARGAIN SXTjRS IX BKRMN
RARRKI) BY THE ARMY
Berlin. Jan. 5. —The inventory sales,
which at this season of the year
usually crowd the streets of the shop
ping districts with bargain hunters,
have been prematurely ended this year
by an order of the military authorities
forbidding during January all kinds of
season sales such as linen sales peculiar
to Berlin and Paris under the name of
"white week" sales, and other specially
advertised closing-out sales.
The prohibition also affects adver
tisements of reduced nrites on woven
and knit Roods and clothing made of
them. Yesterday was the first day of
the inventory sales.
COM/ECTION noxAFinrc
Information was received to-day by
the police department from a local
banking firm, that the recent Austrian
war loan collections, made In Harrls
burK were bona fide. The money is be
ing handled through the Emil Kiss

City. The collections in this vicinity
were made by H, Mlddleton.
CONTINUATION
SCHOOLS OPEN
HERE ON FEB. 1
150 Pupils Will Fill the Desks,
Says Superintendent F.
E. Downes
P L A N S MATERIALIZING
Ten Firms Will Discharge All
Boys and Girls Under
Sixteen Years
The new continuation schools, in
stituted by State law to go into ef
fect upon the first of January or rea
sonably soon thereafter, allowing a
number of days of grace in which
to perfect the details of the plan, will I
in all probability open in this cltyj
February first.
A recommendation that the schools |
be opened oh this date will be made |
by F. E. Downs, superintendent of I
schools, at the meeting: of the school!
board on Friday evening. School board
officials have been extremely busy of
late preparing information and work
ing out details preliminary to the es
tablishment of the continuation
schools. Every employer of child
labor in Harrisburg some time ago
received a slip to be niled out, giving
information as to the status of his
business as applied to the minors in
his employ. Replies have been re
ceived from practically all the firms
thus addressed, and they have been
divided into classes, comprising un
der one head all establishments that
employ minors; under another head
those who employ minors before and
after school; under another, a list of
those who do not employ minors at
all; and lastly, a group of ten firms
that will discharge all boys and girls
under sixteen years of age as soon as j
the law is actually in effect.
150 Will Attend Schools
From these replies it was estimated
that a few less than 150 boys and
girls in the city between the ages of
14 and 1(5 will have to attend the
continuation schools according to
law. The number is very moderate,
and somewhat less than was antici
pated, but it was materially decreased
by the thirty or more minors who
have been or will be discharged.
The names of all pupils who will
have to he schooled have been ob
tained and everything is in readiness
for the working out of the plans and
the appointment of teachers and the
location of the schools. These details
will probably be determined upon
Friday evening at the board meet
ing. Thereafter correspondence will
j be held with all the employers and
| pupils concerned and the report itself
I with its recommendations will be
| made public.
Two Schools Likely
It. looks to Dr. Downs now as
i though two schools will have to be
| opened and he will probably make
I that recommendation to the board.
lln his letter to employers of child
labor in this city, the superintendent
quoted sections of tbo law which are
Ithe most vital, referring to the em
ployment of minors, and telling in de
tail of the method of procedure with
reference to the issue of certificates,
| which become the property of the
| employer and must not be given to
i the minor at any time,
j Until employers shall receive notifi-
I cation that the schools have been es
! tablished, minors between fourteen
land sixteen in their employment may
work tVfty-one hours per week as
'specified in the law.
Mayor Meals to Swear in
Whole Force January 15
j The entire city police force will be
sworn into municipal service January
| 15, despite the more or less general
belief that the "holdover" officers alone
will be required to take the oath.
Mayor Meals has contended right
along that the old police force auto
matically quit with the retiring execu
tive and that the officers who serve
under the new administration must be
sworn in like new appointees. Other
city officials hold that the old officers
who are retained arc simply ••hold
overs" and need not necessarily take
the oath.
The Mayor last evening adminis
tered the oath to J. Thomas Zeil, the
new chief, and ex-Alderman William
L. Windsor, the superintendent elect
of the newly created detective bureau.
Mr. Windsor was sworn in as a special
officer for ten days and in the mean
time Council will have passed the or
dinance creating the office. The Mayor,
the new superintendent and perhaps
the new chief will visit the police de
partments of New York and Philadel
phia to set some inside information
as to certain details of the conduct of
the department on metropolitan lines.
