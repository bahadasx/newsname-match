President and Advisers Annoyed at I
Failure to Receive Reply to Note
to Carranza Dispatched
Last Sunday.
Developments here in the Mexican
crisis were at a standstill
again today while the United
States government awaited impatiently
Carranza's reply to the
note sent last Sunday demanding
a statement of his intentions toward
the American expedition ir.
Mexico.
Messages received at the State
Department from Special Agent
Rodgers at Mexico City made no
mention of the Mexican answer.
Mr Rc.H cr#?r< far Via?; h#?pn iin-1
able to forecast the action of Gen.
Carranza, and the only intimations
reaching here have been
through diplomatic and private
dispatches. These have indicated
that the de facto government was
preparing to stand bv its attitude
of hostility toward United States
troops across the border.
Army Makes Satisfactory Progress.
Upon his return from New York President
Wilson went over all the advices
st hand, but learned virtually nothing:
he did not know when he left yesterday.
After today if it should become
necessary for him to address Congress
he would have to wait until Wednesday,
as both houses arranged to adjourn
over the Fourth of July.
Reports to the War Department during
the day continued to show satisfactory
progress in the military preparedness
for any eventualities on or beyond
the border. Recruiting for the regular
army increased more than 100 per cent
during the week ending at noon yes??
>" rr an in<ri-uSi. ftf mOff I
than 50 per cent the preceding seven
days. A total of 2.036 men were ]
sworn in this week as against 1.105 ,
last week. The preceding average
weekly enlistment was in the neignborhood
of 700.
During the 100 days of recruiting
under the authority granted by Congress
to increase the regular army immediately
after the Columbus raid n
total of 13.251 men have been accepted
out of 50.406 applicants for enlistment.
New York city led the recruiting
last week with 1,024 men accepted
against 275 the preceding week;
Chicago was next with 897 against 227,
and San Francisco third with 421
against 81.
Bulletin by the Censor.
The War Department issued today a
brief bulletin under its new censorship
rules. It reported that increments of
the California and Illinois National j
Guard entrained for the border last i
night, and contained excerpts from |
messages from Gen. Funston, giving a |
variety of border reports already covered
in press dispatches.
Unless Gen. Carranza's reply to the I
last American note demanding an explanation
of his intentions arrives today
and is as defiant, as private advices
from Mexico f'ity have indicated.
It is considered probable 1'resident Wilson
will have to wait at least until
next Wednesday before placing the
Mexican situation before Pongress.
The House planned to adjourn today
over the Fourth of July and its first )
session will be Wednesday.
Administration officials were impatient
at the failure to receive any word of!
when the Mexican note might be ex- i
pected. since the demand for a prompt j
reply went to Mexico City last Sunday.
How much longer President Wilson ,
would consent to wait was a subject
of much speculation.
Indication of Unfavorable Reply.
Another Indication tending to support
the belief that the reply will be un- j
favorable was the memorandum given
out yestercfay by the Mexican foreign
office. It specifically denied all the \
charges contained in the American note I
replying to f'arranza's representations
for withdrawal of troops, and laid t
the blame for attacks on Americans in j
Mexico on the '-arelessness of the l
Americans themselves.
It in untrue, the memorandum Mated. S
that the Mexican authorities have protected
bandits who raided American
border communities, or have made
small efforts to apprehend them.
Strong assurances may be given in
the Mexican reply, it j? believed by official*
here, of the de facto government's
ability to protect th* border against
further raids. The Mexican embassy
stated ">0,000 troops would be available
for the service if the American line is :
w ithdrawn.

[TROOPS RESTLESS
TO GO TO BORDER
District National Guardsmen
at Camp Ordway Want to
Get to the Front.
NUMBER OF REJECTIONS
AVERAGE 15 PER CENT
Minimum Weight Mark May Be
Lowered- and Some of the Lesser
Defects Waived.
Troops at Camp Ordway are getting:
restless. They want to get to the
front. Some of them now even think
that they will not get out of camp,
hut. of course, the orders to send them
to Bisbee, Ariz., so far stand.
With the rush orders of last week I
now standing recalled, and with orders
to keep the organizations in
camp until they reach their minimum 1
peace strength, camp life has changed
from a long period of excitement down
! to a mere routine, nothing different
J from an annual encampment except
orders for their destination at Bisbee.
Inspections of clothing and equipment
are being made by the army officers
and the physical examinations
are being continued, but are being
pushed through with all speed possible.
The troops of the 3d Regiment probably
will complete their examinations
late toniaht, and the medical officers
then will De free to take up the mounted
organizations, which have not yet
been mustered. Battery B and the cavalry
troop will not be mustered until
their officers get their commissions.
Slight Defects May Be Waived.
So many men are being turned down
by the medical officers that it is probable
the minimum weight will be lowered
somewhat in order to keep the
strength of the infantry companies
higher and prevent their detention at
this camp any longer than is necessary.
Recruiting is being pushed in the city,
but volunteers are slow to come in since
the border situation was relieved
through the release of the members of
the 10th Cavalry by the Carranzista
government.
The minimum height is Ave feet four
inches and the weight 120 pounds. Below
120 it is necessary to obtain special
authority from the adjutant general of
the army to enlist. Some slight defects
may be waived in order *o get enough
men, but a decision as to this has not
yet been reached.
It is understood that several line officers
of the 3d Regiment have been thrown out
ori their physical examinations. This will
make vacancies for a number of promotions.
There also will be a large number
of vacancies in the non-commissioned
grades in the companies of infantry.
llejectipns Average 15 Per Cent.
Although official figures on the percentage
of rejections on account of
physical disability were not obtainable
this morning, it is estimated that they
range from 10 to 20 per cent of the
enlisted personnel in the different companies.
This deficiency in strength will have

today
Trie transportation of troops has
been in the entire charge of the American
Railways Association, and routes
have been chosen so that the troops
not only were forwarded to their
stations, but also in such a manner
that train schedules have not been interrupted.
The traffic has been so
evenly distributed among: the roads
that all have had a share in the business.
Headquarters has been in touch
with every unit of the National Guard
from the time it left its mobilization
camp until it reached its destination.
It has been possible to divert any organization
from its original destination
at any time and send it where its presence
might be most necessary. A portion
of the New York guardsmen, including
the 7th Regiment, passed through San Antonio
last night. The 1st Illinois Regiment,
which arrived here last night, will
be followed today by the 2d Regiment, the
1st Battalion, which is expected about
0 p.m.
Illinois Cavalry Entrains.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., July 1.?After
sleeping blanketless all night In the
streets, the 1st Cavalry, Illinois National
Guard, entrained for the border early
today after a delay of fifteen hours
caused by the railroad s failure to furnish
equipment.
Lieut. Col. E. M. Lewis, commanding
the army mustering staff here, plans to
send the remaining 6.000 guardsmen to
San Antonio as soon as railroad accommodations
can be obtained.
Kansans Leave ror Border.
FORT RILEY, July 1.?The train
bearing the first section of the 2d Infantry
Regiment. Kansas National
Guard, left here today for the border.
It was the first contingent of the Kansas
guardsmen to depart from the military
reservation here. The remainder
of the brigade will leave in three more
sections.

be permitted to leave the camp for
the front.
The order to discharge the navy yard
men also will deplete all of the organizations
somewhat.
The discharge papers now are being
made out. and the men probably will
b?? at work Monday morning. So far as
orders of the mustering officer at this
camp now read, these men will be discharged.
Camp will be open to visitors all day
tomorrow, and the troopers expect a
large number of their relatives, friends
and admirers. Every Sunday they believe
to be their last in camp.
APPEAL FILED TO SAVE
SIR ROGER CASEMENT
LONDON. July 1.?The appeal filed in
the case of Sir Roger Casement alleges
three reasons for setting aside the verdict
of guilty of high treason found
against him. under which he was sentenced
to death, as follows.
' First. That no crime had been committed
under the statute of Edward III
by which Sir Roger was tried, because
no such crime as treason without the
realm was indicated in the statute.
"Second, That the lord chief justice
erred in the use of the term "aiding
and comforting the enemy."
"Third, Recause the lord chief justice
in his charge to the jury did not properly
set forth the defendant's side of
the case."
Sir Roger has been transferred to
I'entonville prison. Patrick Francis
Doyle of his counsel found him in a
cheerful mood when he'viisted him. It
is expected that argument on the appeal
will be heard within three weeks.
The home office has announced that
King Ceorge had directed Sir Roger be
degraded from his order of knighthood.
June Advertising
Last month The Evening
and Sunday Star printed
if: i: r i
over a minion ones 01 anver

than 75,000 lines over June
last year.
This was an average of
over a hundred columns of
advertising every week day
and nearly two hundred
columns every Sunday.
The most notable increase
was in The Sunday
Star, which gained over
fourteen columns, or nearly
two pages, of advertising
each Sunday. The Even- .
ing Star gained nearly a
page a day.
The Star daily and Sundav

AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
Gen. Funston Hurrying: Guardsmen
to the Border and Railways Give
Trains Right of Way.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., July i
?Gen. Funston reserved comment
today on the charges of bad
faith made against him bv Carranza's
minister of foreign affairs,
and then concentrated his attention
on the silent marshaling of
his growing army along the border
line.
Reports from Gen. Pershing in Mexico
and from headquarters commanders
along the border reflected the preparations
being made by the Mexican war
department for a clash with the American
army.
Troops trains were nearing the border
from north, east and the west, but increased
efforts were made to keep from
the public the actual schedules of the
trains and the time of their arrival at
destinations.
More Troops Due Today.
With the exception of the vanguard
of the Illinois guardsmen that reached
here last night no fresh troops have
reached San Antonio and will not before
late today or tonight. One of the trains
bearing guardsmen was slipping eastward
along the border toward Brownville
with a precision that was gratifying
to army staff officers.
Railway officials were moving
throughout the United States scores of
troop-laden trains that will reach the
border at hours known only to them
and to officers detailed for work in
connection with the mobilization.
On all lines where army officers and
railway officials believed attempts
might be made to interfere with the
movement small details of soldiers
have been sent and bridges were under
guard.
Border Embargo Eased Up.
JSL PASO, Tex., July l.?Twenty-nve
hundred sacks of corn, consigned to
Mexican merchants in Juarez, -were
passed by United States customs oifl!
cials today, after each sack had been
emptied in a search for contraband
articles. Two days were required to
empty and resack the grain.
Many loads of grain, flour, beans and
similar foodstuffs hare been transported
over the international bridge since the establishment
of what, in effect, is an embargo
on large freight shipments. Mexican
dealers explain their purchases by
pointing out that practically no crops are
being raised in Chihuahua and numbers
of the people are on the verge of starvation.
The food is intended to feed such
people In Juarez and other cities, they asserted.
Villa Reported in Command.
A rumor was current in Mexican circles
In El Paso today that Francisco Villa had
taken charge of the Carranza forces of
15.000 men being concentrated at Bustilios,
about seventy miles west of Chihuahua.city.
on the line of the Mexico
Northwestern railway. Authorities in
Juarez, however, declared the report unfounded.
During the night a heavy provost
guard, a troop of cavalry and a detachment
of infantry mounted on motor
cycles was stationed at. the plaza, while
large posts were kept at the international
bridges.
Although much feeling was aroused
in Juarez by reports that American
soldiers near Ysleta. Tex., twelve miles
east, hat', fired across the border "without
cause," killing a Mexican customs
rider. Gen. Francisco Oonzales, commandant,
said today that th<* civil
populace was well under control.

BOND ISSUEQUESTIOf^
IS TREASURY PROBLEM
Officials Figuring Net Balance for j
Fiscal Year to Determine Needs
of Mexican Crisis.
Treasury officials were busy today
figuring; the Treasury's net balance for
me nscai year, wnun enuea ia?i nminight.
with a view to determining ,
whether a bond issue w ill be necessary .
to care for the extraordinary expenses
of the Mexican crisis.
There is an agreement among administration
leaders to ask Congress to authorize
such a bond issue in the event
the ordinary resources of the Treasury
and the additional $210,000,000 expected
from the administration revenue bill
are not sufficient.
The expenses incident to the Mexican
emergency already provided for or
estimated approximate $125,000,000. .
This, as well as any further expense, '
would be covered in the proposed homl |
issue.
Authority to issue bonds may not be
sought from Congress if the Treasury
surplus is large enough. At the close
of business yesterday it was $171,171,
M5, and prospects were that it
would be increased to more than $200,000,000.
The administration omnibus revenue
bill, which will raise $210,000,000, was
ready for introduction in the House today.
The democratic leaders plan to
nogin ronsioeraucin 01 me measure in '
the House next Thursday under a
special rule providing for a final vote
before adjournment Saturday.
EXFLOSION INJURES EIGHT.
Mexicans Suspected of Attempt to
Blow Up Train Coach.
OAKLAND. < al? July 1.?The police
today began the investigation of an
explosion in the sleeping car of a westbound
Southern Pacific train near here

persons.
VV. H. Brooks, conductor of the train,

near this city. Two of them, he said,
left the train at Richmound. Shortly
before reaching the station here hfound

This thi rd Mexican, the conductor
said, lef'- the train as soon as it stopped
and the explosion came a few minutes
later.
Police Inspector Charles McCarthy of
