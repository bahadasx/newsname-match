DUNKARDS OPPOSED TO WAR
Members of Religious Sect Must Not
Fight Nor Seek Redress Through
the Courts.
Pacifists to a degree not dreamed of
piobably even by Mr. IJryan are the
Dunknrds, or German Baptist llrcth
ren, who recently closed their nn
nual national convention in Falrvlow,
a little hamlet in Newton county, Mis
souri. For tho Dunkards strictly en
join their members not to fight, not
to seek redress In tho courts and not
to take, part in politics. Hut for tho
action of tho Duukards in deciding
"that the tlmo is not yet ripe for the
general use of automobiles." tho eyes
or the world probably never would
havo been drawn to the Dunkard gath
ering. Plain folk for the moat part,
tho practices of tho sect aro modeled
on those of tho early Apostolic
Church. Hence, sobriety of dress,
non-conformity to the ways of tho
world and simplicity In every action
rules tho demeanor of Its members.
And tho Dunkard convention went to
probably the quiest town in Missouri.
Tho discussion of tho motor car
question was prompted by the fact
that hero nnd there niombers of the
faith had becomo owners of motor
cars. Objo iters to tho "devil buggies"
contended that they would cnuso dis
sension and pride. The objectors pre
vailed, though It was conceded that
the tlmo might come when tho ma
chines would be nil right even for
orthodox Dunkards Though it is for
eign to the doctrine of the denomina
tion for Dunkards to engage in poll
tics, tho 1910 convention also held that
In some Instances it might be proper
for a Dunkard to hold office ou a
board of education.
On the first day of the convention.
Sunday, tho candlo light service was
held, much as was tho communion of
the twelve apostles in Biblical times.
Thu men and women gathered in sepa
rate tents. First came tho foot wash
ing, in which each took part, minister
ing to others. Then camo tho even
ing meal, and finally Uie communion
service.
For moro than one hundred years
tho Dunkards havo had a rule against
tho manufacture, sale and use of In
toxicants. WANT THE NAMES OF HEROES
Mlssourl D. A. R. Would Honor Sol
diers of Revolution Who Are
Buried In This State.
In memory or Revolutionary soldiers
burled in Missouri, a bronzo tablet
bearing tho names of the heroes will
to placed In the now stato capital
building at Jefferson City. Tho move
ment to install the tablet originated
with tho Kansas City chapter, Daugh-
tere of the American Revolution, of
which Mrs. Edward George is regent.
It was through E. W. Stevens ot Co
lumbia, that permission was given tho
Knn3us City patriotic organization of
women by tho state capltol commis
sion. Tho promoters aro anxious that
Missouri papers, ns far as possible,
will give -wide publicity to the fact '
that the names ot these dead heroes of '
tho revolution aro wanted so that the
tablet may bear the names ot every
ono buried in Missouri. Thoso know
Ins tho names of any Revolutionary
soldiers aro asked to send the names
to Mrs. Milton Welsh, 1514 Linwood
boulevard, Kansas City, chairman of
committee in charge of tho work ot
preserving tho memory of Revolution
ary soldiers.
Tho tablet will be executed by John
Williams ot New York city, the dimen
sions being thirty-four and one-half
Inches In width by forty-six inches in
height. United States statuary bronzo
will bo used nnd tho finish will bo
oxidized bronze-brown. This mural
decoration will bo Installed In the his
torical museum of the capltol.
Attack the Campbell Will.
A new suit to set aside the will of
James Campbell, railway builder and
public service corporation magnate,
was filed In tho circuit court at S..
Louis. The suit was filed by three per
sons who claim to bo children ot the

I
regular force was In Virginia, enni
mnnded by Lafayette. The British
ileet was nt New York, while the
French lleet was somewhere In the
West Indies.
Wnslilngton decided to hoodwink
Clinton If possible. He made n great
display with his troops before New
York and convinced the British there
that he Intended to attack them. Clin
ton sent n hurried dispatch to Corn
vvullls asking him to send H.000 men.
That was just what Washington
vvnnted.
While Clinton and Cornvvnllls both
thought Washington Intended to at
tack New York, Washington left n
smnll force In Ids Intrenehments and
started southward nt night to trap
Cornvvnllls. The Fren'ch and Ameri
can troops marched swiftly across
New Jersey, through Philadelphia nnd
down In Virginia, towards Yorktown,
where Cornvvnllls had his headquar
ters. Cornwallls Heard Too Late.
Cornwallls hoard of Washington's
npproarh, but too Into to escape. He
begun to Intrench at Yorktown nnd
notified Clinton nf his predlenment.
Lafayette, with his little force, tool:
stntlon nt Wllllnmsburg, only 12
miles away, nnd watched every move
the British made. Williamsburg vvns
n rebellious town, and nt Hint tlmo
capital of Virglnln. It was thero
that Patrick Henry made Ids famous
speech in the house of burgesses In
Mnreh, 177.", when he siild:
"There Is no retreat but In submis
sion and slavery. Our chains nre
forged; their clanking may be heard
on the plains of Boston. ... I
know not what course others may
tnke. but as for me, glvo me liberty
or glvo mo death."
Cornvvnllls had 7.0(10 soldiers nnd
3,000 teamsters nnd others. The
French lleet under Admiral de Grasso
had sailed for the American coast,
nnd the British lleet was forced to
take station to cover New York,
whero It vvns believed tho French
would strike. The two llects met In
bnttlo and September 11, while the
American nrmy vvns at Annapolis, the
French ileet sent the British ships

MAN'S RIGHT TO HAPPINESS
People Are More and More Coming
to Realize the Significance of
Words of Declaration.
"Wo hold these truths to bo self
evident," wrote Thomas Jefferson In
tho great Declaration, "that all men
are created equal, that they aro en
dowed by their creator with certain
unallcnablo rights, that among thoso
aro life, liberty and the pursuit of hap
plncsa." What a splendid herltago
Ing on Washington's campaign, for It
prevented Clinton from sending re
euforcemcnts to Cornvvnllls.
Cornwallls now saw tho net drawing
uround blm. He sent messenger ufter
nicssenger calling for moro troops.
None came. He was hemmed In. The
French lleet blockaded the mouth of
York river, nnd September 2S the
French nnd American nrmy marched
out from Williamsburg nud spread
nround the doomed town. Yorktown
in that day was only a village of some
(10 houses.
Tho French troops occupied half the
lines and the Americans tho other
half. They began regular slego toc
tlcs. Parties of sappers would steal
out from the lines nt night nnd silent
ly build new parapets nearer the
British lines. It vvns risky duty, but
volunteers In plenty wore found for
the work.
All Was Not Well.
The night of October 0, MaJ. Elijah
Favor, who had surveyed the ground,
commanded n redoubt building party.
They stole quietly to within u quarter
of a mllo ot tho British lines. A few
men stood guard whllo tho others
worked. No one was allowed to talk.
The handles ot nil the tools were muf
fled so that not tho slightest sound
would be made. They were so cloo
that tho call ot the British sentries
of "Twelve o'clock nnd nil's well,"
came clenrly to the ears of the Ameri
cans. Hnd tho British only known It,
nil was not well.
When morning enme the British
were astounded to see the fort that
hud risen during tho night. Major Favor
had done his work well. Ills earth
works hnd been completed npd two
cannon mounted In them. As soon as
the British saw this they began n
furious bombardment, hut It vvns fu
tile. The American redoubt had been
well built.
The next night heavier guns wero
placed in the American works, nud
n few nights later tho during Major
Favor built a lino of enrthvvorks so
close to tho British redoubts that one
could nlniost hurl n ball from one to
the other.
October 12 the French nnd American
eomiiinnders decided to storm two of
tho strong British positions. They
thrso "truths" havo been! They have
always boon a court of last resort to
which mon marching In tho advance
havo been nblo to appeal. Tho Ideal
of equality has warred against slavery
and tho casto spirit. Tho Ideal of life,
liberty and tho pursuit ot happliicBH
has been a constant Incentive to keep
ing opportunity open to all men. Tho
goal ha always been distant. But
tho way has beon plain. Today mon
nre realizing as never before the mean
ing of tho right to tho pursuit ot bap.
plnosa. They aro understanding that
NUMBER 10.
were largo earthen redoubts, defended
by troops and artillery. Two columns
wero organized among tho French nnd
American light infantry. A column
wns to attack each redoubt.
Col. Alcxonder Hamilton command
ed the Americans. He had his men the
bayonets nnd then led them quietly to
thu nttnek. They were almost at
tho British defenses before n sen
try distinguished their dim forms In'
the night. The nlnrm was given nnd
firing began Immediately. Tho Ameri
cans disdained to reply. They scram
bled up the steep earth walls nnd
drove tho gunners nwoy with tho bay
onet. Cornwallls Is Desperate.,
Such eournge was too much for tho
British. Some ran and others throw
down their arms.
The French met with n stlffer recep
tion. For nn hour nnd a half tho
lighting went on In their redoubt. Then
tho British capitulated. Thus, In ono
night, tho nllled nrmy had scaled
Cornwallls securely In the trap.
Cornwallls now beenmo desperate.
He tried every means ho could Invent
to force Washington to withdraw. Oc
tober 14 a strong party ot British
troops made a sortie. They fought
bravely but -were outnumbered nnd be
fore morning came hud been driven
back Into their works.
The British general nest tried to
move his nrmy ncross tho river nnd
take Washington ou the Hank. Winds
and high wnter forced him to aban
don this project.
All this time Cornvvnllls had been
using the homo of Governor Nelson of
Virginia for his headquarters. Gov
ernor Nelson commanded the militia
In the army of Washington.
The night ot October 10, General
Washington sent for Governor Nelson
nnd told him thut he planned to bom
bnrd the town and show Cornvvnllls
how helpless resistance was.
Brave Governor Nelson.
"But," Washington ndded, "your
home may ho destroyed In the fight."
"Do not let that stand in thu wny,"
Governor Nelson replied. "I will fire
tho first ball at my house myself."
The next morning the brnvo gov
ernor kept his word. He aimed and
llred the first shot of n terrific cannon
ade that covered every part of tho
British lines.
Amid the uproar of the cannonade
the Americans heard tho British drums
hentlng tho parley. Soon n white flag
came over tho ramparts and n Brit
ish olllccr delivered n message from
Lord Cornwallls asklhg for a 24-hour
truce, during which time commission
ers would discuss surrender.
Washington refused. In 24 hours
ho knew Clinton might send a lleet and
moro troops nnd Cornvvnllls would es
cape. Ho gave tho British two hours.
Tho commissioners met Immediately,
mid before tho brief tlmo had passed
urraiigeineiits had been made for thu
surrendcr of the British.
