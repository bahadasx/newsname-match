]MEXICAN SITUATION EASING, UP
WITH RELEASE OF PRISONERS.
The announcement in the dispatch
pgs of Jpne, 22 that a small band of
JAmerican soldiers under command of
Capt. Boyd had been surrounded in
iasbush by Mexican soldiers and
'butchered with machine guns, made
it look certain that there would be
war with Mexico. -rhe company was
part of the colored troops that fought
5o- valiantly in the Spanish-Ameri
can war. Twelve were killed and
seventeen were m.de prisoners and
taken into Carrizal, near which the
dight occurred. Capt. Boyd was also
killed.
Later news, however, seems to in
dicate that Carranza has yielded tc
thedemand of the United States that
these prisoners be released. While
this does not mean positively tha'
fbe will ,be no war, it opens the
way to further negotiations that may
result in the settlement of the af
fair.

The Summer Normal School Has Fea
tures Interesting to Visitors.
Have you .visited the Summer Nor
mal? If not, you are missing a great
deal, and at the same time you are
not showing the appreciation and
courtesy due the many young stu
dents and faculty now stopping in
rour town for a period of six weeks.
The entire school is alive with
work. A visitor is first attracted to;
the gymnasium by the noise of ham
mers and saws and machinery. The
boys, men and ladies are hustling
about under the guidance and tute
Jage of Mr. Frank N. Boudousquie.
The many very neat pieces of wood
work standing around is evidence of
a large amount of talent and me
chanical skill in the students that
only the summer school has brought
out. There are stools, hall benches
costumers, book cases, porch swings,
Ironing boards, music stands, um
brella racks, dog house, work boxes,
chests, benches, etc. Fathers, conje
out and see your boys working.
The mothers, too, will find the girls
just in the room to the right in this
same building, all in white aprons
and caps, sleeves roiled up, "four at
each table, cooking.

Mr. Poitevent Gives
Warning That
Should Be
Heeded
The following letter from Mr.
Poltevent sounds a .warning that
should be heeded by the farmers and
stockraisers of St. Tammany parish
Nothing needs to be added to it to
arouse the people to adopt all pre
cautionary measures. ft is much
easier to prevent it than to conquer
it after it starts.-Editor.
New Orleans, La., June 26, 1916.
Editor St. Tammany Farmer:
'Dear Sir:-I am enclosing clip
ping, taken from the official journal
of Hancock County, Miss., which is
our next door neighbor, calling their
people's attention to the oharbon
which has come to their notice in
their county.
As you will see, they are advising
their people to vaccinate their stock,
and to burn their dead stock if same
'is suspected of having charbon.
This clipping has prompted me to
write you, knowing your interest
shown in the parish towards stock
raising. ,Personally I have not heard
of any charbon this year, in St. Tam
many parish, ibut believe if we wif
start to use precautions now it may
keep any big epidemic of same from
occurring.
This company is preparing to vac
cinate all their stock, which they do
every year, as we figure it as insur
ance.
Trusting that you will understand
my suggestions in writing you, and
with best wishes, I remain,
Yours truly,
JUNE POITEVENT.
The clipping reads as follows:
Vaccination Prevents Charmbon.
T oprevent widespread outbreaks
of anthrax, known also as charbon
which has appeared again in three
counties of the state, Dr. E. M.
Ranek, state veterinarian, is warn
ing stockmen in all localities where
this disease was prevalent last year
to vaccinate their stock imnmediately.
Vaccine for this purpose can be
bought from any wholesale drug
house at a cost of fifteen cents r
dose. This is cheap insurance as r
dose will protect an animal for
year.
While the twenty-seven outbreaks
of last year were all stamped out, it
was not without considerable loss o'
stock, and as the disease is not cur
able, iDr. Ranck urges taht every
possible precaution be twken. "Al'
carcasses of diseased animals must
be burned," he says. "It is not safe
to bury them as earthworms have
been known to bring 'up spores of
the disease as long as fifteen years
after burial. Kill all buzzards that
come about the place."
All warm blooded animals, includ
ing man, are susceptible to the dis
ease, and in Bolivar, Coahoma and
Hancock counties, where the disease
'is at present reported, a total of a,
proximately forty-five head of mules
horses, hogs and cattle have been in
fected and killed.
People may contract anthrax by
handling dead animals, hides of
wool; sometimes halrDking mill
from diseased cows and by fly 'bites
,As several deaths among people
were caused by this disease last year
Dr. Ranek urges caution to the pee
ple living in infected epuntles.
If any stock are suspected of hav
ing anthrax, an ear can be cat off
about pn Inch and a half from /ths
animal's head, securely wrapped and
mailed to the State Veterinarian, Ag
ricultu.al College, MUss., where a
diagnosis will be made.
