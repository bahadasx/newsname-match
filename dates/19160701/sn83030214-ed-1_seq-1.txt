fFrom The Tribune BurttU.)
Waahington, June .10.?Statementa of < abinet oflfcera to
day, coupied with Preeident Wileon'a speerh in Philadalphia
yeaterday, confirmed the belief in Waahington that the Mexican
situation v.ill not apain become acute unless another ( arrizal
incident occura.
Althoujrh Officials insist that Carranza's answor to Preai?
dent Wilaon'a defnand for an explanation of his intentkn is of
the first importance. there is said to be no danger that an un
satisfaetory reply will be followed by drastie action here.
One of the President's chief Cabinet advisers decUred to
day that Mr. Wilaon'a patience wai by no means exhau^ted and
that he would continue to attempt a peaceful aolution of the
problem as ionp as he believed it poaaible to ftnd one. The
President's inaiatence yeaterday on jaatke for weak nations ii
interpreted in the same way.
One of fne things puzzling Washington is Carranza'.*
delay in reptying to President Wiljon'a note. It is expected roh
momentardy. The delay is attributed by snme onlciali ko '.tr
ranza's belief that the United Statea will conaent fo mediation.
Meanv. hile conflicting reports on the nature of th< Merican
reply are -nckJinj? into the capital. Private advicea from M".\
