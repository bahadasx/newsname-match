Germans Resume Drive at Verdun But Paris
Statement Says Attacks Repulsed; British
are Holding Gains Along Somme Sector;
London Wild With Excitement Over Announce
ment That Great Offensive is Begun.
LONDON, July 1. The allies supreme offensive began at
7 :30 o'clock this morning: with simultaneous attacks by the
British and French. Two hours after the assaults began the
British had captured 16 miles of German forward trenches
north of the Somme.
A British statement declared that the French gains were
"equally satisfactory." Paris did not announce the results.
The British attack on a 20 mile front followed the most ter
rific four day bombardment in the history of the world. While
firmly holding the captured trenches the British are pressing
forward farther.
The British statement said : "At 9 :30 we had occupied the
German front line, digging in behind rows of German dead.
The British casualties thus far are not heavy." The official
statements were fragmentary.
The drive began a few hours after the Germans had launch
ed most powerful onslaughts against Verdun. Paris announc
ed that the Germans were repulsed everywhere, except where
they had recaptured Thiaumont
Many prisoners were taken, but it was impossible to obtain
estimates of the captured or the losses.
On the remainder of the front, British raiding parties contin
ued to harrass the Germans, penetrating their defenses at sev
eral points.
At two o'clock this afternoon the war office issued a warning
that people should not travel on the continent unless they had
the most serious business. Everybody going to the continent
was warned that they must undergo the strictest examination
under the passport regulations and a close search of persons and
baggage.
Describing this morning's attack, the Chronicle correspond
ent wired : "All the horizon beyond where I stood was darkened
by fumes of shells. Not a minute passed without the crash of
high explosives. Raids followed the shellfire at many points
and brought forth sufficient prisoners for identification of the
regiments and divisions confronting the British. The effect of
the British artillery on the German troops was deadly. Some
prisoners say they have not eaten in three days owing to the
heavy fire which prevented supplies reaching them "
GERMANS RESUME VERDUN DRIVE
