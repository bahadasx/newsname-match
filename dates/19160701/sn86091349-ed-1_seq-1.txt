RENO, Nevada, June 29 Samuel
Piatt, Republican candidate for the
United States senatorial nomination,
tonight sent the following letter to
Frank H. Norcross and A. H. Howe,
candidates for the same nomination:
"Our respective candidacies for

convention have been announced. In
this contest I attribute to both of
you the loftiest motives and an earn
est desire to co-operate loyally for

HOW THE RED CROSS
SEAL ORIGINATED.
Anti-tuba. xulosit Workers Afte $750,
000 Fund.
Nearly $2,500,000 has been raised by
Red Cross Christinas Seals in the lust
seven years, and yet ninny people who
will buy these holiday stickers at this
eighth annual sale do not know how
the charity stamp idea originated.
It was war that brought forth the
charity stamp our Civil war of 'ill to
'65. Some of your grandmothers first
played "post office" with stickers sim
ilar to Red Cross Seals 'way hack in
1802, when they conceived' the idea of
selling stamps at fairs for the benefit
of the relief funds for the soldiers'
hospitals in Brooklyn. Boston and
elsewhere. Nearly $ 1.00H.0O0 was rais
ed la this way before 18U5. After the
war this method of raising money was
discontinued in this country for a gen
eration, although It found vogue In
Portugal, Switzerland, Austria,
France, Spain. Denmark, Norway,
Russia. Sweden and other European
couutries. There are now several
thousands of differeut types of charity
stamps used In all parts of the world,
as many as forty Itelng used in Aus
tria for children's hospitals alone.
Stamps or seals were first used to
get money for the anti-tuberculosis
crusade in Norway ami Sweden in
1004. To Jacob Uiis, the well known
social worker of New York, and to
Miss Emily P. Itissell. the energetic
secretary of the Delaware Red Cross,
jointly belong the honor of originating
our American Red Cross Christmas
seal. In 1007 Mr. Itiis's interest was
aroused by the receipt of a Christmas
tuberculosis stamp on a letter from
Norway. He published an article about
this queer looking stamp in the Out
look and suggested some possible uses
for it In this country. Miss Hissell at
once saw an opimrtunlty here and pre
pared a stamp, from the sule of which
her society realized $3,000 for tuliercu
losisi work. So impressed was she with
this success that she induced the Amer
ican Red Cross to take up the sale In
MKXS on a national basis. With very
little organization ami with hardly any
attempt at careful advertising the sale
that year brought in over $135,000 for
anti-tuberculosis work in various parts
of the United States. In 1000. with
more thorough organization, the sale
was increased to $230,000, In 1010 to
nearly $310,000. in 1011 to over fXW.
000 aud In 1912 to over $400,000. In
1913 the sale was Increased to nearly
$450,000, and last year. In spite of war
and hard times. 22 per cent more, or
55,000.000 seals were sold, totaling
$550,000 for the anti-tuberculosis war.

Brief Mining News
Reports received from Alta through
private sources are that the Copper
Prince tunnel of the Michigan-Utah is
improving continuously as the work
progresses. The latest report Is that
there is a full breast of ore, most of
which appears to be of commercial
quality.
Production of ore at the Prince
Consolidated at Pioche, Nev., the past
week, all of which was shipped to the
smelters of Utah, amounted to 74 car
loads. This Is estimated at 3,700 tons,
or more than 500 tons a day. The
heaviest day was 650 tons and the
lightest 430 tons. - Vi
Sublessees on the American Flag
property of Park City, which recent
ly was taken over by the Park City
Mines company, have been shipping
some good grade of gold-silver ore
from the 500 and 700-foot levels. A re
cent consignment of nineteen tons
brought about $800. The ore averaged
$40.90 a ton.
The city is full of mining men, large
and small, looking for purchasable
properties, and of miners who want
to work in them. These nights a
stranger is fortunate if he secures a
place to sleep. All this as a result of
the publicity Wood river's mining re
vival is receiving on the outside, says
the Hailey, Idaho, Times.
One of the new big copper proper
ties of Montana is to be listed on the
Salt Lake stock market on account of
the large market that the local ex
change now affords. Those behind the
property have decided that Salt Lake
has a good market for stocks and,
therefore, will list the Boston & Mon
tana Development company.
The United States will' within the
coming year be producing more than
800,000 tons of zinc annually. Smelters
which depend on the foreign ores are
sending mining engineers throughout
the western fields in the quest of zinc
ores and concentrates.
Tom Buell, the successful mining
man of Round Mountain, closed a deal
last week whereby he, with Tonopaa
associates take over the property of
the Antimony King Mines company
located eight miles south of Austin,
says the Reese River Reveille.
Two prospectors a few days ago
located an enormous body of tung
sten ore, three and one-half miles
southwest of Mount Montgomery,
Nevada, and only one mile from the
Southern Pacific tracks.
Plans are being perfected by engi
neers in Salt Lake and San Francisco
to generate electricity from the slack
beds in the coal fields of Utah. With
in six weeks an experimental plant
will be established at some point in
Carbon county, where tests will be
conducted under all conditions.
Judging from his first Inspection Of
Ihe new Sawtooth mining district In
Millard county, forty rflve miles south
west from Oasis, on the Salt Lake
Route, L. Holbrook. a well known Salt
Lake mining man, declares that It Is
his opinion that It will make good.

Pioche Citizens
Ready For War
Should war be actually declared
against Mexico, and Nevada is called
upon to furnish her quota of troops,
Lincoln county will not be found
wanting. It will be on the firetng
line with a good representation of
its patriotic sons.
Last Wednesday County Clerk
nlverwell recevied a set, of .blanks
form Governor Boyle, which the ex
ecutive had sent in the effort being
put forth not only to organize a
national guard, put also a company
of volunteer cavalrymen.
One of the blanks provides for the
signatures of those wishing to join
the national guard; the other to
those who desire only to volunteer
their services during the present
crisis.
Mr. Culverwell has obtained the
names of nine persons who are an
xious to serve their county as volun
teers, if they are needed, and they
are as follows:
W. T. McNabb, W. J. Stphens,
C. W. Austerman, W. M. Bambric,
Henry Ross, Maurice Bowling, Frank
D. Young, Louis Costoro and Chas.
Culverwell.
Some thought, when they heard
that Mr. Culverwell was going to join
the ranks, that it was only a joke.
But it isn't; Charley means it, and
when the Nevada boys array them
selves before the Mexican frontier.
Charley will be there with the rest
of Nevada's soldier boys.
