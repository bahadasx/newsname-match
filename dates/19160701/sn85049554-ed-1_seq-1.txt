^--London, July 1.—After weeks of tor
tense fighting with guns of every cali
ber firing a million shells' !ally, the
British^ early today launched a general
offensive against the German lines
along a front of twenty miles north of
the river-Somme. They succeeded In
taking the Owman front line trenches
and many men.

::r Offensive Long Heralded.
This is the first time since the war
began that the intentions of an army
to undertake -an offensive-has been so
well advertised. A week ago when
the German attack against Verdun be
gan to-make headway and it was
feared the army of the German crown
prince was getting in a district of
Verdun which was dangerous for the
allies the British guns began to speak.
Since thep, except for the hours when
British infantry were raiding German
trenches, a continual bombardment has
been kept up..
Big Guns Pave Way.
#&• Batteries, which now are innumera
ble, took turns at smashing the Ger
L'S" man defense, destroying commuirtca
?J|i tion trenches and blowing up ammunl
®i| tion depots. New trench mortars, par
p-Sf ticularly destructive, tore away "the
wire entanglements, broke down para
pets and generally opened the way for
mt men with rifles tyid bayonets. Big
guns of fifteen Inches and other large
11" caliber prevented the Germans from
breaking up their forces, which
.. wrecked all within range.
.Fiercest Artillery Battle.
^The artillery fire was particularly
intense on a stretch of the front north
—.
0f
the Sosame. and earlier messages
told of the destruction .of the towns of
Thiepval and Befiucourt, where the
Germans had concentrated ammuni
tion. Early today more guns wer«
brought into action on this twenty
mile sector, and for an hour and half
the Germans were subjected to a. bom
bardment which is described be^t a«
tne fiercest experience in this war of
heavy artillery.
To Cost Many J*«rir
This morning the correspondents at
the front for British papers, while
writing, of the artillery and raiding
successes, waijied the public that an
advance must be made by Infantry and
not by artillery and that the British
army could not expect to come out of
the fight scathless. First accounts of
the battle state that the British deaths
were not heavy.
The neVte spread thruout London like
wildfire.' There was a frdntfc rush to
obtain special editions of the evening
papers.
Travel Curtailed.
'The war office aunounced that the
necessary passenger traffic between
Great Britain ^nd the continent would
be regulated, closely and reduced as
much as possible. Only those having
serious reasons are permitted to travel.
Allies Gain on All Fronts.
The allies are now on the offensive
in practically every field of the war.
^he British assault comes on the heels
of the successes won by tlte Russians
III Gaiicia and Bukowina and are still
going on. On the Italian front the
central powers have met with reverses,
and for many days the Italians have
been driving
rthe
Austrian* from posi­
tion after position in the Trentlno.
The defense also of Verdun by the
French appears to have stiffened and
the balance of battle in that bitterly
contested: sector appears recently to
have swayed In favor of the defenders.

and the predictions of an -allied" ad
vance in that region have been num
erous.
Previous Offensive Failed.
The last considerable offensive un
dertaken by the British was 'a drive In
force at Loos in September, 1916, in
conjunction with a similar French efh
fort in the Ohampagne district. The
British took Loos and claimed to have
taken 20,000 Germans and many guns.
They were unable to press home the
advantage, says the war office, be
cause reserves failed to comb in.time.
The British official losses id this bat
tle were 16,000 men.
The portion of the line selected by
the British for the Inauguration of the
present drive runs from the Somme
north past Albert to a point about
eight miles south of Arras. The Bel
gian army holds the trenches from the
North sea to a point about six miles
northeast of Ypres. The British army
under General Sir Douglas Haig, holds
the .line from the junction with ^the
Belgians as. far as the Somme.
GermansvDid Not Expect Attack.
The sector of the German front on
which the British assumed the offen
sive forms a considerable bulge in the
British line. The southern end rests
on the Somme, over which the British
are pushing, altogether different from
the fiat, marshy and bleak aspect of
Flanders.
At many points on this sector it is
possible to see the trenches of the Ger
mans, winding about between opposite
slopes. A military expert writing of
the offensive says:
It is safe to say the Germans never
sxpsctou a gi6st attack In this coun
try. We may hope, then, for a reduc
tion of the German salient there and
the securing of better strategic posi
tions. Far more important than that
it is certain this attack will be de
structive toHhe morale of the German
troops."
The number of Germans opposite the
British front and reserves behind the
line was estimated a month ago at
800,000.

I Returning Stolen Property.
Efforts-of the Carranza government
to restore American property seized
by bandits in various Mexican states
were reported to the state department
by Special Agent Rodgers today. He
said some of the gold and silver re

He also reported the publication in

CARRANZA IS BLUNT.
Reply to Demands Charges Bad Faith
by Americana.
Washington, July 1.—Administration
officials learned with dismay^ the de
fiant character of Gen. Carranza's
memorandum, Issued in Mexico City, in
reply to Secretary Lansing's 6,000 word
note of warping.
In his memorandum Carranza in
sists that the American forces be with
drawn from Mexico immediately. It
makes no reference to President Wil
son's ultimatunTof Sunday, and apprr
ently Carranza will ignore that docu
ment so far as any specific response is
concerned.
Charges by Carranza.
Summed up, the Carranza memoran
dum Says:
Mexico never consented to the' Per
shing ^'expedition as it was conducted
and demands removal of the troops.

failing .to -protect the border.
Whien the American government rec
ognized' Carranza it was cognizant of
border outlawry.
Mexico defies the United States to
prove that it protected bandits.
The stubbornness of Watson, min
ing leader, was to blame for the San
Ysabel massacre.
Mexico notified the United States
that Villa was. at Palomas, and to ex
pect the raid*on Columbus.
The United States troops entered
Parrail against Mexican orders and are
to blame (or the fight there.
One hundred and forty Mexicans
have been slain recently on American
soil. The slayers have gone unpun
ished.
Two Courses of Action.
As a result of this development the
outstanding features of the situation
are:
If the president intends to employ
the army in Mexico to restore order
along the border it will be necessary
to send in sufficient reinforcements to
cope with the hostile Carranza forces.
If the Carranzistas attack the Amer
ican force a state of war will-develop,
requiring probably a call for volun
teers numbering from 250,000 to 500,
000.
Fails to Rebuke Trevino.
The first demand of the Wilson ulti
matum Carranza met by releasing the
American: troopers captured In the
Carriza! battle. The second demand,
to deflne hfs attitude toward the United
States, was intended to give him the
opportunity to repudiate Gen. Trevino's
orders which resulted In the treacher
ous attack on the Boyd command.
There is no repudiation of the Trevino
order in the memorandum and Car
ranza stands pat on his mandate that
the Atnerlcajn troops In Mexico shall
be allowed to move in no direction ex
cept to the north.
It is expected that the" note will be
ready for ./perusal by the president
when here
turns from New York to
day. What steps he will take as a
result (ft the disclosure of Carranza's
attitude Willi bo determined at a series
of conferences between the president
and his advisers.
Mayj iForce. Carranza Out.
UnusuaJ significance is attached to
the-remark by the president that the
t,roops are to be kept in Mexico until
Carranza or somebody else restores or
der. The-- utterance lends color to the
gossip In. official circles for several
days to the effect that the Carranza
governrrfent isj£ tottering and that

here as lo the identity of this- "some
body else." According to some of
ficials it is Gen. Obregon, In whom the
administration on more than one occa
sion has demonstrated that it places
great confidence.
According to others, Felix Diaz,
nephew of the late president of Mex
ico, is on the point of overturning the
Carranza regime and\seizing control of
the d.e facto government.
Repeat Huerta Incident?.,
Indications are not lacking that the
administration would not be disap
pointed by the elimination of Carranza
through the operations of the American
army in the north and Diaz in the
south, just as Mr. Wilson succeeded in
driving out Huerta through the opera
tions of Carranza in the north and
the American navy and army at Vera
Cruz.
The Diaz party is counting upon the
fact that the United States will have
a strong force of armed men In Mexico
and on the border as one of its assets
when the time comes to make the
strike and seek to depose the present
first chief.
Reyes Faction Joining Carranza.
Chihuahua City, July 1.—Tropps of
the old Canuto Reyes faction of ban
dits continued to arrive -in Torreon to
offer their services to the de facto
government, say reports here Jose
Issabel Robles, the former .. Villista
leader, has been active in getting their
submission. Gen. Jose Santos has in
formed General Trevino that not a
single' band has appeared in his dis
trict in the last thirty days. Gen. F.
Maycotte has replaced Arnul Gomez
as governor of Durango.

FATHER AND TWO
SONS DROWNED
Attempt by Clarence Maehew of Mount
Auburn, to Rescue His Boya Futile
and Ail Three Perish in River.
Waterloo, July 1.—An attempt by
Clarence Maehew, aged 45, to rescue
his two sons, Elmer, aged IS, and a
younger son, aged 12, from deep watt*r
proved futile" and all three went to their
•-death In the Cedar river four and one
half miles east of Mount Auburn, about
5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, accord
Ing. to a report received in Waterloo
last evening.
The bodies of the two boys were
recovered soon after the tragedy and
taken to the undertaking parlors of
Cripple & Young at Vinton. Up to
midnight, however, the body of the
father, had not been found. A search
ing party, equipped with grappling
hooks and other rescuing apparatus,
abandoned their efforts at that hour
and resumed their labors this morning.
It is thought that the body is lodged
in the qulckflsands of the river and if
the body is not recovered today It is
likely that dynamite will be used.
Mr. Maehew was a wealthy farmer
residing near Mount Auburn and num
bered a host of friends thruout Benton
county. Mrs. Maehew, who witnessed
the tragedy, was reported in a seri
