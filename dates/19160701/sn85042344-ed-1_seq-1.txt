................ ..----a
Spai-ial to The World.
NEW YORK, Juno 30. On tho first
call for volunteers for service In
Mexico Col. Theodore Rosevclt will
lender to tho department the services
of a full army division with the re
quest that he be allowed tJ lead It as
a major-general of volunteers.
In the recruiting- of this force Col
onel Roosevelt has been busy for the
last ton days through ngents In this
city and various parts of the country.
It was declared on high authority last
night that the plans were .10 complete
that mobilization of the division at a
given point can begin at two hours'
notice, tho plans for Its formation, Its
officers, and equipment hming been
completed to the minutest detail some
weeks ago.
This In substance Is tho announce
ment mado on the highest authority
In this city last night. At the same
time It was announced that, the colon
el's plans for recruiting tho division
has beon submitted to army authori
ties, and received their approval.
RiMwevclt's Plan fir Illusion.
As outlined tho Roosevelt plan oalls
for a division of four brigades, one
infantry, one field artillery and two
of cavalry, to be officered by men of
the regular service or men who have
seen actual service. In addition it
will have an aero squadron, a fully
equipped hospital section, the usual
machine gun division and an engi
neering corps.
The decision of Colonel Roosevelt
to take this step was reached. It Is
understood, ten days ago, when the
president decided to call out the na
tional guard for service on the bor
der or In Mexico. Prevlits to that
time hlB mall had for wefks been
filled with offers of service from men
who had served with him In the war
with Spain, from ex-regular. and oth
ers anxious to enlist under bis com
mand. The bulk of these offers came from
individuals, but In many t.'ises whoit
camps of Spanish war veterans asked
to be enrolled as possible recruits, and
in other cases groups of ex-regulur
army men, some of them men who
had held commissions, asked tho same
privilege.
It Is from this class of men that the
command will be recruited if the nec
essary permission issues from Wash
ington, Its very quality enabling those
officers who will bo assigned to com
mand It to place It in tho field at a
minimum expenditure of time in
camp. No difficulty Is exptcted u
getting the twelve thousand men nec
essary.
The officers, from the four briga
diers down, will. If tho colonel has his
way, be men with whom hi is person
ally acquainted and whose records a
professional soldiers are of the bost
Many linger to tio.
In a measure tho agreement ot
these men to accept such tommunds
If tendered them has been obtained.
So far as the men are concerned, the
only difficulty will be one of elimina
tion. Aside from the fact that tho
regiment will largely be recruited in
the college centers of the east and the
ranches of the west and southwest,
the command will bear little resem
blance to the rough riders rrgiment
which the colonel led Into Cuba IS
years ago. One lesson of that cam
paign was the need of more seasoned
men, more readily amenable to the
strict discipline of camp hfe. The
large percentage of ox-regulars and
men who raw service In the war with
Spain Is expected to provide for this.
As an evldonce of the completeness
of the plans for mobilization of such
a division. It was stated las, right that
e''en the necessary mounts have been
arranged for, the light animals for
cavalry mounts through tentative con
tracts placed In the west and south,
the heavier draft - anlmuls for the
commissary and artillery sorvira,
through arangements made with con
tractors. The aeroplanes, It Is rinTerstood,
will be provided by wesllhy New
Yorkers cfflllated with thr. Aero Club
nf America, from whose ranks It Is
expected tho majority of th aviators
will be choson.
That tho colonel had tome such
plan under way has been a mutter of
dlKcusslon In the IJai-vaM end other
uptown clubs for several days past,
hut It was not until last night that any
definite Information as o what he
had in mind was forthcoming.

Finance Committee Finds
Itself in Deep Water
After Exposure.
THIC Democratic financial commit
too, which has been paddling Us
Utile canoe for the mit several weeks
through entirely placid waters, where
squalls and nautical unheavals
seemed utterly foreign, suddenly ran
afoul a typhnon of Republican wrath
yesterday and their frail bark, con
structed of unreliable planks, natural
ly capsized, leaving the voyagers
floundering.
The fynhoon was nothing mere or
less than an expose of a letter pub
lished In The World, twenty thousand
corles of which lotter had lieen
mailed to Democrats only In Tulsa
county, urging them to prepare them
selves In order to register in a last
effort to overcome the majority piled
up by patriotic Republicans who were
determined not to be disfranchised in
spite of an unspeakublo registration
law. '
Consternation prevailed among
members of the committee yesterday
when the light of day was turned on
tho letter so that all might see to
what ends the Democratic party is
going to get the names of the faith
ful on the registration books, whether
they belong there or not.
Anyway to Get on.
"Anyway to get tho names on the
bocks" must have been the slogan
adopted by the committee. "Send
your neighbor's name before Friday
night, as tho party has only four days
In which to fland or fall," admon
ished tho letter. It made no differ
ence to the oinmltteo how tho names
were obtained It seemed, but the lut
ter recommended that the telephone
could he usd best to see that none
of the neighbors were overlooked.
It made no difference to the com
mittee that tie registration In this
county Is In a terribly muddled shape,
and that little or no attention had
been Paid to keeping within the re
quirements of the law. The commit
tee proceeded to make a last valiant
effort to overcome tha load of the
Republicans, even If the law did have
to be stretched and warped.
The letter lefers the faithful to a
subject-that was popular about fifty
yenrs ago. It 1 eclares that the forth
coming campaign will determine
whetlor or not this state Is to be
ruled by white inn or negroes and
carpetbaggers.
When asked If this was truly their
belief, members of ihe finance com
mittee merely laughed and exclaimed,
"Why of coutse not. That's merely
pontics."
Worked Overtime
Night after night candidates for
various county orricee on tne Demo
cratic ticket gathered In the county
commissioners' room In the court
house where they worked until late
hours stamping and mailing thousands
or these silly and untrutnrui letters
to members of the party In all parts
of the county.
The registration closed last night.
Although It was understood that all
voters were required to register during
9 ten-day period early in Mty it Is
said that many of the registrars have
been making every effort to see
Democrats and register them before
the last day when the books must be
turned over to the election board.
Registrars are supposed to register
only those voters who were out of the
county during the time of registration
and who will make a sworn affidavit
to that effect. The finance committee
didn't bother to point this out to the
"neighbors" and other Domocrats In
their lust appeal but requested them
