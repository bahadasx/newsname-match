Lodon. June 20A-The French at Ver
dun have recaptured the Thiaumont works
just north of Fleury village. The fight
was one of the most stubborn and deadly
engagements of the whole long drawn
and terrible battle of Verdun. It began
this morning after the usual bombard
ment. Through a decimating fire curtain
the French infantry dashed and carried
the fort by assault. The Germans re
formed and sent in their massed infan
try.
Time after time they came on and at 3
o'clock this afternoon they re-entered the
system of redoubts.
Then the French took up the counter
offensive and after an hour and one-half
of bloody work Fort Thiaumont was
Pecurelv held by Gen. Petains' regiments.
Meanwhile almost as desperate work
had been going on along the Hill, No.
304. on t he west side of the Meuse. Here.
after the garrison of the front line of
French trenches had been literally buried
under a storm of shells the Germans
eaptaued a section of the works.

With the way thus cleared the Rus

vance they are meeting with almost no
oppoistion. Not only is the rear of the
Austrian army seriously menaced, but
Lemberg also Is threatened from the
south. In this connection the Berlin
statement tonight admits that Gen. von
Bethmer's army is seriously threatened
by the Russian advance south of the
Dniester. Here the Russians already are
reported to have passed west of the
Strypa. where it joins the Dniester.
From Copenhagen comes the report of
a battle which began on Thursday night
off Landsort in the Baltic and continued
throughout the night. It states the Ger
man cruisers, accompanied by some large
warships, attacked some Russian torpedo
boats and destroyers. -German re-enforce
ments came up. forcing the Russians to
withdraw. Themselves strengthened, the
Russians returned to the engagement and
firing began again at 6 o'clock this morn

(By the sun News servies,)
New York. June 2.-Theodore Roose.
velt hammers away at his favorite topic,
national preparedness, in hin article In
the forthcoming Metropolitan Magazine.
-e says:
"It is an act of literally criminal folly
on our part that for twenty-two months
we have taken not one step of efficient
preparation, although even the blindest
must have seen during theme twenty-two
months that, as the world now is. nothing
but a nation's own strength can save it
from overwhelming disaster.
"I doubt if. in the history of mankind.
there have ever been rulers more blind
than our rulers have shown themselves to
be during these twenty-two months. Only
the merest handful among all the public
servants at Washington have shown
eagerness to fulfil their obligations to the
nation. It is a cruel and a wicked thing
to our children, and children's children,
no less than to ourselves, If we do not
now bend every energy to prepare.

Jutland Fight F
Of Dreadnoul
(By the Sun News Service.)
New York. June 30.-In an article in the
Scientific American of July 1, printed by
courtesy of E. A. Power, Admiral George
Dewey points out the lessons learned
from the recent naval engagement off the
Jutland const.
Tn the opinion of the admiral, the value
of both the Dreadnought and the de
stroyer is proved, but the possibility that
the fast, lightly-armored cruiser will ever
supplant the Dreadnought is shown to be
unlikely.
From the various reports which have
reached the United States concerning the
naval battle, Admiral Dewey states he
has decided that the German fleet was
feeling its way to sea on May 31. de
riring an opportunity to strike a blow
at the British fleet, which was spread
out over three hundred miles. The hazy
weather. making it difficult to see a
ship at six miles, favored the Germans.
"MEXICO HAS
UPPER HAND"
Minister Azcona Says South
ern Republic Is Better Pre
pared Than U. S.
BUT DECLARES CALAMITY
OF WAR MUST BE AVERTED
(By the Sun News Service.)
Paris. June 30.-Minister Azeona, whc
represents the defacto government of
Mexico at the capitals of the allied na
tions and Spain, arrived In Parie today
from Madrid. In an interview he said:
"My government will exert itself to the
utmost to avoid war by which Mexicc
would have nothing to ga!n. There Is ne
Mexican national feeling against the
United States, nor vice versa; it is simply
a question of the manifold financial, in
dustrial, commercial interests involved,
"War would inevitably cause racta
strife between South and North America,
the Latin-Americans proffering us thefr
help. Germany unquestionably is striv
ing to provoke a conflict, but it enjoys
only the smallest amount of influence in
Mexico.
"At the start the advantage would be
on the side of Mexico, which has in the
field 20,000 men trained by five years of
continuous fighting, which would be in
creased shortly to 500.000 men against
15,000 which the United States has a
Its disposal.
"Mexican ports would be bombarded
and wrecked and the Mexicans would
soon be without ammunition, but the
war would be no promenade.
"It is possible that in the event of
war Villa's bands would join against the
invader. but rumors of a reconciliation
between Villa and Carranza are unfound
ed. There is still a price on the head of
Villa.
"The pacification of Mexico under Car
ranza was just setting In when it was
upset by Villa, who is the real wrecksr
of Mexico.
"The calamity of war in America must
be avoided."

without agitating for an immense in

"I believe emphatically in our doing oUr'

Recently a trained officer of the coast
artillery, who would be himself in any
fighting from the outset, informed me as
his cold and deliberate judgment, that
100,000 war-hardened veterans of any of
the contending armies, if now landed in
New York. could not only defeat any

or forty days reach Chicago, conquering
and holding all the intervening country

The destroyers and trawlers, making up
the advance line of the British fleet, sight
ed the Germans and notified the battle
cruisers behind them. These dashed in
lat the German ships. making thirty
knots an hour. Three of these, the Queen
Mary, the Indefatigable, and the Invin
cible,*were sunk early in the fight.
Admiral Dewey says:
"Battle cruisers with the weight of their
armor sacrificed to speed. with fewer
big guns than have the Dreadnoughts,
cannot give and take with the latter
class of ships. In grips with Dread
noughts they are pretty sure to be sunk.
"The battle cruiser was crumpled up
and Its unfitness to play a leading role
in naval dramas was demonstrated.
*The impression that a torpedo is sure
to prove the undoing of the Dreadnoughts
has not yet heen demonstrated, and the
survival of the Marlborough tends to
prove it"
OFFICERS LAUD
MILITIA WORK
Rapidity of Mobilizatioi by
Guardsmen Pleases War
Department.
130,000 TROOPS LIKELY
TO BE READY BY JULY 21
Military preparations to meet possible
war with Mxicu are being rushed to
completion even more expeditiously than
the War Department anticipated, accord.
ing to army officers yesterday, who ex
pressed particular gratification with the
clocklike regularity with which the plans
for the mobilization of the National
Guard were being generally carried out.
Instead of Indorsing the criticisms of
the militia mobilization, the War Depart.
ment takes the view that matters are
progressing much more smoothly and
speedily than expected.
It is expected that the nobiUsation of
the National Guard will be completed
within a month from June 21, the day
when it was ordered by President WIl
son. And officials of the War Depart
ment said yesterday that getting 130,000
militia troops ready for service on the
border in that time was in Itself a task
which would do credit to any of the
European war staffs,
It was a far more difficult task, they
added, to get men from civilian life into
shape for military service along the pro
portions stipulated by the National Guard
mobilization than to mobilize regular
troops. as the European powers did at the
outbreak of the war.
Great Britain required a montl in
which to get 160.000 regular troops with
necessary equipment into Flandes when
the war broke out, army officers explain
ed today. It now requires a week for the
German army to move one army corps of
40,000 from one front to the other, which
is a distance of 4ll0 miles. while in the
American mobilization troopg in some in
stances will be required to go nearly 8,000
miles to their destination.

Wexican Commander. Eager to Fight,
Calls on U. S. Officer to Arrange
for First Battle.
By ff. N. STANBBURT.
(Internatieal News Service.)
El Paso. Tex.. June 30.--Carranza
troops are still assembling in forces of
menacing proportions on the south, east
and west of Gen. Pershing's main po
sitions at El Valle and Colonia Dublan.
A Mexican column. estimated at *.00
men, is reported at Guzman. on the east
and just forty miles south of Columbus.
A scouting party from Columbus to
night Is endeavoring to locate the po
sitions of a similar force which is said
to ave slipped through the passes of
the Sierra Madre Mountains from Sonora.
Namiquipa and aU positions to the
south which have been evacuated by the
American commander have been garri
soned and strongly fortified by the Mexi
cans.
Pershing Free Menseed.
The sum of this situation is that Gen.
Pershing has been forced, by the delays in
dealing with First Chief Carranza, into
a position where his little army of 15.O
is likely to be attacked at any time from
three sides by a force of not less than
60,0M0. If he moves in any direction ex
cept the north, as Carranza has ordered.
he must fight.
These are not military secrets. They
are facts known to every intelligent
Mexican on the border and they brag
about the successful strategy of Gen.
Trevino at every opportimity. The Mex
ican commandera along the border are
convinced that there is going to b1 war
and are making active preparadons
for it. Their attitude is that if
President Wilson does not take the initia
tive on the strength of what has already
happened, they will make some move
that will force his hand.
Throughout the northern states there
Is a disposition publicly to belittle the
efforts of the first chief to prolong the
diplomatic controversy between Wash
ington and Mexico City.
At Nogales today the Mexican comrnan
der, Gen. Norza Garayea. was so eager to
start the fighting that he called upon the
American commander. Col. W. H. Sagae.
to make arrangements for the first bat
tie.
Feeling rnrlaxtd.
The meeting was held in the American
consulate on the American side of the
border. Col. Sagae advised the Mexican
officer to await instructions from his gov
ernment, saying that he intended to fol
low such a course unless fire4 upon from
south of the border.
In Juarez the feeling has not relaxed.
Gen. Gabriel Gavira. once reported exe
cuted by order of Minister of War Obre
gon, has returned without his former
friendly smile. He has announced that
his instructions are to resist with all the
strength of his force any effort to take
the town or make use of the railroads
terminating there.
The cavalry horses and part of the
oquipment of the prisoners taken at Car
rizal were delivered to Gen. George Bell,
Jr., during the day. The animals, twenty
five in number, were emaciated. Several
of them had been marked by Mexican
bullets, but not one was seriously
wounded.
