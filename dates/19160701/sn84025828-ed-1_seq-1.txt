CONNERYS FIRST
Office Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In
terest in "Fire Appliances."
The threats made by members ot
the Connery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
the Connerys have on public affairs.
The result Is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder some of this gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can uso tho United States Gov
ernment In their business.
They evidently have found the
Stato of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to the family pdssesslons.
Domocrats in Chicago are wonder
ing 'why all of the public Jobs are not
given to Connery'H.
It may be due to the fact that thore
are not' enough Connerys to go around.
Connerys First!
What a noble family motto that is
to be sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Connerys and their well
known hankering for good things.
"State Street Store" Blockl as you
may havo heard him referred to, a
partner of John T. Connery In the coal
business, Is a member of the Board
'of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds the nice-salaried
Job of Secretary ot Reviewer Blockl.
Partner Blockl will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
of other contracts in which the Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been interested are not so far forgot
ten that tho public interest in them
ever wholly died out.
There was a number of talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We havo roferred to some of theso
worthies before as our flies will at
test. But talking ot the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get tho party treason which brought
it about.
Democrats do not forgot the dose
that some members of the Connory
gang gave Mayor Dunne in 1D07 when
ft he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many in
I the light of the Royal Family of tho
sfTDemocratlo party, entitled to most,
w f not to all, of the Jobs in Its gift,
ne Connery's are allegod to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
great.
When John W. Rainey, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk of the Circuit Court
in 1012, tho Connery outfit fought
shlm at the polls In favor of Joseph
Ibta m,iii.if I i n DotiukiUiiM
p. uranin, til., u inuiii.u.
When Robert M. sweltzer was run-
-hub iur iiia uuiuuuraiiu iiuiiiiiiuuuii
tor Mayor in 1915, the Connerys saw
nother chance to put a member of tho
nlly In that office and they trotted
i,ut Francis D. Connory, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller of the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But the Democratic stomach was
showing signs of bnlking at an over
diet of Connery find the noble Francis
D. was sent buck to the payroll to
wait for nnothor chance.
Sweitzer got the nomination and it
Is said that the Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
one ot the princes of the blood and
were not over-enthusiastic for Swelt
zer's eloctloiii-to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much. .
It is reported that Joseph B. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law of John T. Con
nery will seek the Republican nomi
nation for Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Rainey, the present
.efficient Democratic Incumbent of that
office.

Joseph M. Connery, cousin of Fran
cis D. Connery, Henry E. Connery,
Joseph F. Connery, John T. Connery
and Michael M. Connery has been
mentioned for tho Democratic nomi
nation for Board of Review this year.
State Street Blockl, the business
partner of John T. Connery, will not
have a chance to run again for his
present Job on the Board ot Review,
until next year.
So William J. Connery, nephew ot
John T., Joseph F., Francis D., and
.Michael -M. Connery will retain bis

But by next year a few more of

Connerys as It would bo too bad to
havo Blockl, John T. Connery's part

a ticket where there was not another
member of the Connery family to keop

Connery first the rest nowhere.

TO RULE OR RUIN
Threat of Official Connery Gang to Kill
Newspapers Which Criticize It Shows
Public Bossism at Worst.
The loud mouthed threats of tho
Connery gang of Public Office Holders
to "put tho Chicago Eagle out of the
malls and otit ot business" for daring
to criticize the public acts of some of
Kb members are arousing public at
tention. The people have known right along
that the Connerys were credited with
holding many public Jobs In Chicago.
The people havo known right along
that the Connerys were In the coal
business to make money.
They have known right along that
a member of the Connery coal firm
Is a member of tho Board of Review.
They have known right along this
official's private secretary was a Con
nery. They have known right along that
the Attorney General's Office Investl-
Oppression, and Which on One Oc
se Head Tried to Blackmail
gates matters connected with public
offices.
They have- known right along that
the Official Investigator ot the Illinois
Attorney General's Office Is a Con
nery. They have known right along that,
a city clerk some ot whose methodB
the present city clerk did not follow
was a Connery.
They have known right along that
the man who passes pn the bills ot
Contractors for the Sanitary District
of Chicago is a Connery the Comp
troller ot the District.
They have known right along that
most ot the public offices in Cook
County are honeycombed with Con
nerys. They know that the Recorder of
Deeds, who runs again this year,
whose office contains several Con
nerys, Is a Connery.
Now they know that tho Connery
gang feels so sure of Its grip on the
public that It is heard threatening to
use the Federal Government to silence
criticism of its methods.
If this Isn't Bossism in Its worst
form, what Is 7
DOWN WITH BOSSISM!
Voters and Honest Citizens Gen
erally Must Arouse Themselves
from Their Apathy and Free
Chicago from the Yoke of Po
litical Bosses.
Tho people of Chicago have restod

enriched themselves with power and

bosses regards tho voting public with
ill concealed contempt, as they forage
first on one sldo and then upon tho
other in search of spoils.
Tho only tlo that this gang recog
nizes Is the coheslvo power ot public
plunder.
It makes Republicans out of them

another year.
They get the best contracts and
tho best Jobs for themselves.

THE PEOPLE
ARE SLAVES
Unspeakable Insolence of Office
Holding Gang in Chicago
Arouses the Public.
Tho overbearing insolonco ot somo
of the office holders in the City Hall
and County Building calls attention to
tho fact that an Office Holding Aris
tocracy Is rapidly growing Into perma
nent control ot our publlo affairs.
Among our officials thero aro somo
honorable exceptions some men who
feel that they are in office to servo
the people.
But there aro others and their
number is increasing who Imagine
that the only thing the average citizen
Is good for Is to vote.
Party allegiance is forgotten when
they are sworn in and the Jobs go
to relatives, regardless of party or fit
ness, The Office Holding Aristocracy has
no uso-for the voter after ho has used
him. .
Herbert Kaufman paid his respects
to these fellows when ho called atten
tion to their treatment of the public
in these words:
"You consider yourself an Important
person because your'posltlon occasion
ally permits you to annoy people. But
so can a gnat, a rusty hinge, a rattling
window and other minor bothers.
"Impudence is a Smart-aleck's con
ception of Impresslveness n back
stairs notion of 'big folks" behavior.
An upstart betrays himself by tho
manner he displays his authority.
"Those who aren't accustomed to
tho use of power invariably abuse it.
"Insolence is the snarl of tho Insig
nificant 'big head' evidence ot a
small one.
v"You merely show up when you
show off. Wo all know Just about
what your Job pays and therefore how
much Intelligence It demands so why
bluff?
"Ofllco boys, boll hops and cash
girls may possibly mlstako your im
pertinence as a manifestation ot su
periority, but tbo public recognizes
tho ass In the ill fitting lion's skin.
"Headquarters always hoars tho
creak In the machine and soon locates
tho source of tho trouble."
Tho voters of Chicago may bo fools
aomo ot tho tlmo; they my be fo
suplno part of the tlmo that these Pub
lic Office Aristocrats look upon them
as Borfs.
But tho voters of Chicago nro not
going to bo fools all of the time.
And whon thoy wnko up, some of
theso swell heads will hear from them.
