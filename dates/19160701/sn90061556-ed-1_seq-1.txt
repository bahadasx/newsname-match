NEGRO TROOPERS MET DEATH
WITH SMILE AND SONG.
Captain Morey, Carrlzal Battle Sur
vivor, Says He Never Saw Such
Valor as Displayed by Brother Of
ficer, Boyd.
Field Headquarters, Mexico, by
wireless to Columbus, X. M June 2G.
American Negro troopers faced al
most certain death at Carrlzal with
smiles in their eyes and slang on
their Hps, and they burst -into song
once or twice as they fought their
grim fight against odds. This was
the story told by Captain Lewis S.
Morey, when ho arrived at field head
quarters today.
"For forty-five minutes the men
fought, joking among themselves all
the while,-even though they realized
wo had been' trapped and had little
chance of getting out alive," he said.
Captain Morey said ho had never
seen such valor as was displayed by
Captain Charles T. Boyd in leading a
handful of dismounted skirmishers
through the machine gun fire and into
the ambush of death. He added that
it was not until their ammunition was
exhausted that the troop was finally
cut to pieces and he told of the heroic
death' of Lieutenant Henry R. Ada!r
of Portland, Ore., in an attempt to re
plenish it.
Adair Died Fighting.
Lieutenant Adair died fighting, his
last words being, "Go on, sergeant,"
to a non-commissioned officer at his
side. Captain Morey said. The two
were on their way to the pack ani
mals carrying the ammunition, when
they were Intercepted near a small lr
rlgatton ditch by a detail of the Mexl
cans. Lieutenant Adair had already
.been wounded and had lost his pistol
in the previous fighting, but he had
borrowed another and was fighting a
hand-to-hand battle when he was kill'
ed. He fell backwards unconscious
and was caught by tho Negro sergeant
as he slid toward the ditch, which was
deeply filled with water.
The sergeant held Adair in his
arms, his face above the water, until
he died. The wounded officer revlv
lug only to .leave him and finish the
mission.
Men Were Warned.
Captain Morey said that Captain
Boyd warned the men before the fight
that they were advancing into the
greatest danger. He reiterated that
the Carranzltas opened fire first from
their machine gun trench and assert
ed that almost immediately afteward
a detachment of the Mexicans circled
to tho rear and drovo off numbers of
the American horses, which a few
men had been loft to hold while the
cavalrymen dismounted in line of
skirmish.
Tho bItr nf the battlefield and the
cover from which the Mexicans fought
made It necessary for his troops and
that nf nuntnln Bovd to senarate and
to fight what were practically in
dividual engagements, captain aiorey
said.
Captain Morey was brought here by'
troops of the Eleventh cavalry sent to
rescuo Carrlzal survivors after having
led a handful of starving, panting
troopers forty miles over a sun-baked
desert to relief. The few crumbs of
food they had were carried in their
handkerchiefs and in their first aid
kits, while what water they had was
carried in a baking powder tin, which
they had picked up on tho' roadside.

salem will have their annual sermons

100,000 NEGROES READY TO FIGHT.
The .following Associated Press dis
patch was published throughout the
country last week:
Tuskegee, Alabama, June 22. When
informed by- an Associated Press rep
resentative today of the killing of 12
Negro soldiers, Emmett J. Scott, Sec
retary of the Tuskegee Institute, called
attention to the fact that eighteen
years ago when war" was declared with
Spain that the late .Booker T. Wash
ington, Principal of Tuskegee Insti
tute, called upon the Negro people of
the United States, and particularly
upon Tuskegee graduates and former,
students, to volunteer for service in
defense of their country. Hundreds
of Negroes followed this advice.
Secretary Scott states t hatthere are
a dozen or more Tuskegee graduates
and former students in Mexico now
as members of the various colored
regiments. "Negroes," he states,
"will rally to the defense of their coun
try now as they have always done. As

the first American soldier to lose his
life In Mexico March 21 of this year,
was a Negro, so the first man killed in
the Revolutionary War was a Negro.
The Negro' people take pride In the
fact that it was the charge of Negro
troops at San Juan Hill. in the Spanish
American War that turned the tide
there, and that Negroes have fought
bravely in every war in which this
country has engaged. Tho Negro was
with Jackson at New Orleans, with
Perry on Lake Erie and 180,000 Negro
soldiers served in. the Civil War.
"The Negroes o. thi jtcountry," he
states, "will be no less patriotic t
this time than in former periods of
stress and storm. The Negro possess
es a patriotism that rises above injus
tice and wrongs. He is American
through and through. The President
will find no hyphenates among us.
Tho Negro has never faltered in de
fense of his country; he will net falter
now. If President Wilson desires to
employ sturdy Negroes to defend the
flag, he can bo assured that a hundred
thousand and more are at his dis
posal." RETRIBUTION
