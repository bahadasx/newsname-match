London, July 1 The long expected
offensive began at 7:110 this morning
when the English forces swept for
ward along, a twenty-mile front north
of Somme, t penetrating the first Cer
nian line nlong a sixteen-mile front
and taking many prisoners.
The attacks of the British troops
Were still in progress -when the last
iief bulletins were filed at army
headquarters. The French attacked
the enemy simultaneously with t the
British and penetrated deep into the
German deefuses.
Loudon received reports 01 the Brit
ish offensive shortly after it was an
nounced that the Russians had cap
tured the important Galician city of
Kolomea and that the French had re
captured Fort Tlm:umoi.; northeast of
Verdun. It was also reported that the
Italians were steadily pushing forward
in the Trentino. '
The British thrust followed four
days of artillery preparations, mil
lions of high explosive shells having
bathed the German lines for a dis
tance of ninety miles extending from
Ypres to Somme. At dawn today the
Kiitish guns concentrated their lire
on the line from Arms to 'Somme,
blotting out the trenches.
At 7:30 the big guns suddenly lifted
their fire and long rows of British
troops sprang forward. By !):30 they
had occupied the first German line
and were digging themselves in behind
huge rows of German dead. The dis
patches say the British losies thus
far have, not been heavy.

BY GIBSON
The marketing of the 191G crop of

Annual Report Presented, by 0. C. Cooper
County Demonstration Agent, Shows
Accomplishments During Past
Twelve Months
SUCCESS IS RESULT
OF CO-OPERATION
Active Farm Bureau arii Good County
Officials Responsible' Statement
Details Gives Work of Entire
, Season'
"I believo that, Grady county, with
the kind of co-operation being given
by agent, county officers and cominer
cial bureau, is accomplishing as much
in the better agriculture movement as
any county in Oklahoma," O. ('. Coop
er said on his return from the agents'
short course meeting at Stillwater.
Mr. Cooper gave a complete report of
his .work for the. year while attending
the meeting. Other agents did the
same thing, and the local man declares
that he is positive of tlnee things. The
first is that Grady county has the liv
est. commercial and farm bureau in
the state, the second is that county of
ficials in Crady county co-operate with
the agent's work more fully than they
do in any other county, and the third
is that the local bureau is furnished
r.'ith the best quarters of any in Okla-
jtioma. , , - , . -
The report covered every phase of
the work being accomplished in Grady
county. That it has been perfectly
satisfactory to fed iral and state de
partments, county officials and farm
bureau directors is evidenced by the
fact that the agent has been appoint
ed for another year with a raise in
salary.
The report shows six community
center social clubs, in which women,
boys and girls are taken; twelve anti
hog cholera clubs; 213 members of the
boys clubs; a county demonstration
farm and thirty-three demonstrators,
doing work with corn, corn and cow-
peas in alternate rows, corn and pea-j
nuts in alternate rows, cotton, kaflr, j
wheat, oa,ts, sndan grass and sweet, j
clover; four members of the Oklaho-1
ma Seed Growers association; and j
preparations being -made for twenty
township fairs.
Concerning these section exhibi-i
tions, Mr. Cooper states that there will
be a township fair in every municipal
township in the county except one,
and that two of those, the ones at
Minco and Tuttle" will be as large as
many county fairs. Tho county dem
onstration farm is owned by Ed Bur
ton, four miles east of the city, where
everything is being managed under in
structions from the agent.
Besides this, there were 1."2 home
gardens kept by Chickasha children
during the spring, three school gar
dens in Chiekasha and five in the
country.
Concerning the co-operation of coun
ty officials, Mr. Cooper's report to fed
eral officials states that both the coun
ty commissioners and the county su
perintendent have lent aid in every
possible manner. "I believe M. II.
Shepard is one of the best county su
perintendents In the state," the report
says. "He not only is a great help
personally, but he also insists that his
teachers co-operate with us."
Concerning the Commercial and
Farm bureau, the report gives the
membership at 127, and the amount
paid into the treasury last year as $3.
STS.'O. The club paid out. besides a
part of Mr. Cooper's salary, $10 a
month rent on the bureau rooms; $30
a month, upkeep on the car; $10 a
month, stenographer; $12 a month,
telephone expense; and It a month,
lights and ifas. They purchased a new
Ford car for the agent last month and
have promised a raise in their part of
his salary for next year.
Mr. Cooper declares that after hear
ing the reports from other agents, he
is positive that the local work is fur
nished the best quarters of any in the
state. The room is by 110 teet,
with desks for both man and woman
agents and stenographer, with a ladies
rest room, furnished, a reading and
bulletin table, and a place li it1'lu'
exhibits.
The report made by Mr, Cooper In
cludes only his own work, which Is
only a part of what is being carried on
in Grady county. The rest Is in cum,
of Mrs. Nettie Coryell, women's dem
onstration agent.
CHICKASHA
LOOKS GOOD
TO VISITOR
Traveler Comments on Prosperous Appear
ance of City; Declares College is
Great Drawing Card; New
Hotel Big Asset
"Chickasha is more prosperous ap
pearing to the visitor right now than
the city has been at any tlmo during
the five years that I have been trav
eling through here," a salesman re
marked this mornitlg. ns be walked
froi the Rock Island depot west to
the bank building. "And the town
isn't second to uy city on the west
side, either," he continued, "as he sur
veyed the business buildings In the
first two blocks of Chickasha avenue.
"You know," the drummer said, "It
has been a common sight in all west
side towns for several years to see
any number of v.cant store and office
buildings. 1 remember when a lot of
these along here were unoccupied. I
tell you, it looks mighty good to see
them filled. And it looks still better
to see the upstairs office floors occu
pied." The man travels over pracUeally all
of Oklahoma and knows business con
ditions throughout the stats pretty
well. That's part of his business. And
he Is likewise an authority on the
place each city holds in the opinions of
"outsiders."
"Chickasha is generally considered
one of the most solid cities In the
state," he said. "Its growth bus been
steady and substantial, and it has
every resource necessary for the sup
port of an excellent town, it has the
railroads, going out in seven direc
tions and giving the city excellent op,
poitunities to become a distributing
center, it has shops that have a very
substantial payroll, it has oil mills,
flour mills and other factories, and It
has school advantages second to no
city in the. state.
"And after all, you've'got to give the
kind of advantages the West citizens
want if you are to have this cluss of
people coming in," he concluded. "The
Oklahoma College for Women, If it Is
given a chance to grow and the proper
kind of local support, will bring a
thousand families to Chickasha during
the next ten years. It is one of the
greatest assets the city will ever pos
sess. Besides bringing in thousands
of dollars In revenue, to the city every
year, it will increase wonderfully tho
value of property in general. A col.
lege town is always given the prefer
ence when someone Is seeking a new
location."
"The proposed new hotel?" the
traveler asked, a he turned In at the
bank building. "Yes, It would surely
be a big asset."
FILE SUIT
AGAINST CO.
The commissioners of Grady County
are made the defendants in a suit filed
in district court this morning. It
seeks to cancel a deed made by the
plaintiffs, Carl and Virgie Terry, to
Grady county, al.d an injunction to pre
vent the use of the land by the county.
Plaintiffs allege that a title was ob
tained to their land on June 5,
the plot including a strip KVa feet
wide and a half a mile long, the game
to be used as part of a public highway,
but they maintain that they were In
duced to sign the papers by a neigh
bor who misrepresented conditions.
The land is in the south part of the
county
lAGED WOMAN IS
TAKEN SUDDENLY
The death of Mrs. N. A. Wilsonthe'
mother of Mrs. Hugh Cowan, occurred
suddenly early this morning at the
home of her daughter, ,',3 Iowa. As
Mrs. Wilson arose this morning, in re
sponse to an inquiry from her daugh
ter, she staled that she was feeling
good, and death claimed her only a
few minutes later.
The deceased was 7(5 years old and
was a resident of Terrell, Texas. She
had been visiting her daughter here
since the first of May.

BIG YIELD
OF BARLEY
Six thousand and seventeen bushels
of barley from one field of 130 acres
is thought by grain men here to be
near tho record for Grady county. It
was raised by It. A. Lyle, the hog a"hd
alfalfa man of four miles west of town.
The grain has been threshed and meas
ured and Is now being held in seed
bins.
Reduced to bushels per acre, the
yield on the Washita valley land was
411 3-1 bushels. Mr. Lyle Is a member
of the Oklahoma Seed Growers asso
ciation, and will hold the entire crop
to sell later in the season. It was in
spected before cutting time by O. C.
Cooper, county agent, and District
Agent Ferguson, a requirement before
seed can be sold through the associa
tion. '
With barley worth practically the
same as wheat, the grosB revenue on
the land If the grain were sold on the
market now would bo slightly more
than $10 per acre.

Wheat has not been damaged at all

thousands of bushels of grain, de
clares J. T. Ray, a farmer and wheat
raiser of eight miles northwest of
town, who was an early business vis
itor this morning. Mr. Ray sta'es
that he has sixty acres of grain In the
shock which ho will thresh just as
soon as he can get to it.
"At least two threshers are ru--?i:ii)
oet in niy neighborhood now," he said.
"lu one field, the grain Is threshing'
out about 21 bushels, and In the other'
sligntly less. I liese, however, were
exceptionally good fields." Mr. Ray
believes the average will run above
twelve bushels.
Damage from wet weather itl be
negligible, Mr. Ray says, though some
loss may result from the fact that
many farmers cut their grain a little
too green.
