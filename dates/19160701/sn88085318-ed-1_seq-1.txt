OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
With this month of July the na
tional political campaign is <>■>.
The conventions have been held.
and the delegates are back home.
The men and the platform* have
been selected, and nothing now
remains but the big noise and
Dome desultory voting in Septem
ber and November. Then tilings
will move along again in some
manner until something elte hap
pens, or until another campaign.
The socialists got in their work
t ai'ly. ami by referendum vote
elected their candidates, giving
Debs a rest'this time. The demo
crats at St. Louis renamed Wilson
and Marshall. The republican!
at Chicago decided on Hughes
and Fairbanks. And the pro
gressives nominated Kooscvelt
and are now holding the sack
since his refusal of the nomina
tion.
The republicans this year made
good their statements that pro
gressives should come back to
them "chastened and willing to
take a hack seat." In the repub
lican convention in this state, the
standpat element controlled, and
at the Chicago convention, out of
the forty-two voles casl for presi
deni by this state's fourteen
delegates, only one vote was cast
for Roosevelt, the other forty-one
votes going to Hoot. Weeks,
Hughes and Fairbanks, showing
distinctly how this state's repub
lican organization looked at the
progressive upstarts.
The naming of Hughes and the
writing of the requblican plat
form were by the standpat ele
ment, and Messrs. Taft, Root,
Penrose, Wall Street and Special
Interests went hack home with
eulogies for Hughes as the man
they want. Roosevelt was beaten
by the men whom he beat four
years ago. and it is loudly hinted
that the money to nominate
Hughes came as a revenge against
the man who beat "Brother Bill"
in 1912.
On the other hand the declina
tion of Roosevelt to run on a
third ticket, and his indorsemeni
of Hughes as ;i man but not of the
republican party or its principles,
are said to lie a studied plan t"
heat the standpat leaders at their
own game in consequence of their
refusal to permit his nomination
by the republicans, friability to
elect Hughes will definitely show
that without Roosevelt no repub
lican ticket can be elected. He
showed that four years ago. He
will show it again. And in I!H'i»
he will be the Logical candidate
for president.
The l!)l(j campaign by the dem
ocrats is based on the accomplish
ments of the administration. Tin
Hughes campaign is based on the
desire of certain manufacturing
interests to regain their hij-'li
tariffs for personal profits, and on
the desire of other interests to sec
this country adopt a military at
titude. Wilson has kept the
country from the European war.
and in this he is denounced by
the Hughes people, who denounce
him for not having taken military
issue with German}' in the invas
ion of Belgium and the linking
of our ships.
"Hughea and War" will be tnei
by "Wilson, Prosperity and
Peace," and tbreughout the long
hot days of the summer, and tin
hazy, delightful days of autumn,
the battle will rage between rabid
partisaj*S, on platform and itump,
in newspapers and pamphlets, iiii
til on election day the farmer and
the laborer and the artisan and
the average citizen will go to the
polj,s and vote the way he has <\c
eide(L How he will Vote, the
prophet* of the country have not
yet definitely decided, hut the Ex
aminer will record the decision as
soon as it has been fully agreed
upon.
The Spokesman-lit view under
date of June 14th, nays: "New
platform will require many ex
plunntiotM. The work of fram
ing a platform will severely test
Ihe ingenuity of the democratic
lenders. The Baltimore platform
of 1012 opened with the declara
tion thai it is a fiindaim ulal prin
ciple of the democratic party that
the federal government under the
i solution has no right or power
tti impose or collect tariff duties
' I'i'pi For the purpose of revenue.
What to dn with that plank is a
conundrum."
IVnnit us to ask this question:
After the democratic party lias
levied sufficieni duties to meet the
running expenses of the govern
ment, what use have we for any
more; unless it would be to build
bigger what is already known as
a manufacturers' multimillionaire
aristocracy.'
h is the same old republican
Benreerow, used in the game old
w«y, I'roteci the American manu
facturer by levying a higher
tariff I'ollei't millions more than
We need, Pilch from the con
sumer ,-ni he will possibly stand
for the enrichment of the manu
facturer, tinder the guise of prn-
ItectinK the American laborer.
If the American laborer will re
flect for a II 11l lie Will see till'
iiiun'ii 1 iii the woodpile, lie will
sec even more -he will see great
shiploads of foreign laborers com
ing to America after the war is
over, and they will not lie labeled
protection lor American labor,
bni 1 ariff for the American manu
facturer.
Think this matter over seriously
ami you will decide to vote for
prevention instead of protection.
■You will vote to prevent the re
publicans from coming into power
and taxing you on everything you
out, drink and wear in order that
they may colled millions to en
rich the American manufacturer
under the guise of protecting
American labor. Republican
speakers tell you liny want a
tariff so high that in effeel it will
prohibit, the importation of for
eign goods. The woi-d "prohibit "
sounds good, but they don't want
it to prohibit. They want to hide
behind it and place the price of
their goods at the same price of
the foreign goods.with the tariff
added, and thereby enhance their
profits.
If they want a tariff so high
that in effect it. is prohibition to
the foreign manufacturer, why
don't they ask for prohibition
against the foreign laborer, and
prevent him from coming here in
open competition to you in every
trade, calling and profession.'
The old saying that an ounce >f
prevention is worth a pound of
cure, should read "an ounce of
prevention is worth .1 pound of
protection."
Clair Hunt this week issued his
completed map of the Colville In
dian reservation, showing in red
mk all the reservation land to be
opened to homestead this month.
This is the only map of the kind
in existence, even the congress
ional delegation from this state
having failed to get this informa
tion for public use. Hunt's new
map is a world of information,
and is the only map which gives
ill the desired information. With
ibis map he issues an 18-page
folder, and the map and folder are
both sent by mail b,v Clair Hunt,
('olville, for $1. ('lair Hunt's
map is sold throughout the Oreai
Northern system and endorsed by
