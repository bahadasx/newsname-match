Official Mexican Statement
Blames United States Sol

International N"s Service:
MKXICO CITY. July 1. American
troops began the battle of Carrizal
after refusing to give Gen. Gomez,
the Mexican commander, time to
telegraph for permission to let the
I'nited States soldiers piss through

official report on the conflict issued
here today.
The report was forwarded from
Chihuahua City, having been written
by l,ieut. Col. Riva. who was ap
pointed by den. Gomez to confer
with the American commander when
the I'nited States force appeared at
Carrizal.
The text of the report follows:

"On the 21st of the present month,

an American force, composed of
about SO or 100 mn.

force, to ascertain whaT was its ob

formed me that he cam in search of
a party of bandits which were in
that vicinity. I answered him that
there were no bandits Investing that
locality, because the section was per
fectly guarded by constitutionalist
forces. He then said that his troops
desired to jco to Villa Ahumada to
look for a de-rter. to which I an-j-wered
that we had orders not to
permit the advance of Americans in
any other direction than north. To

BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, July 1, (via London.)
At about half past seven o'c'ock
this mornin.cr a viRorous attack was
launched by the British army. The
front extends over about 20 miles
north of the Somme.
The assault was preceded by a. ter
rific bombardment lasting about an
hour and a half. Jt is too early yet
to give anything but the latest par
ticulars. A3 the fighting is develop

The British has already occupied
the German front line. Many pris
oners have already fallen into our
hands and as far as can be ascer
tained our ca&ualties have not been
heavy.
The artillery bombardment of the
last three days concentrated this
morning in a fire of unprecedented
fury and in number of guns in the
region of Albert and the Somme.

At 7:30 a. m.. through clouds of

Only the Best For News-Times Readers
Developments during: the past K) davs, the most critical
period in United States history since the beginning ol the Civil
war, have made it imperative that South Bend newspaper read
ers should be kept in close toich with affairs between this coun
try and Mexico. The News-Times, in addition to printing all
the news carried by other papers, either in or out of the'eitv,
regarding developments, has given its readers a dozen or more
important "scoops," in newspaper termology, during this critical
period. The News-Times was able to do this for its readers
through the medium of the International News Service, the
agency which furnishes the paper with its afternoon report.
Here are just a few of the most important stories which have
appeared first and exclusively in the afternoon edition of The
News-Times during the past 10 davs or more:
june ...-oiiresons omeial statement in which he accepted full
sponsibiiuy for the slaughter at
June J 4. I- irst news of the rescue
cavalry f-om the battle of Cirrizal.
The fact that Wilson's cabinet had decided to send an ultimatum to
Mexico for the release of the prisoners held at Chihuahua. (This
story was not sent out by other news services for more than H tf hours
after it had appeared in The News-Times.)
June 2t Lansing and Wilson refuse mediation proffer made by
Ii tin-A m or icans.
June 27 At 11:.10 o'clock The News-Times issued an extra carrying
the story that Carranza had decided to reject the U. S. demands. This
also appeared in the regular evening edition. The story- was denied
from various sources but recent developments have confirmed it;
A complete story of the experiences of ("apt. Morey, the only white
man to escape from the Carrizal slaughter, was given exclusively in
The Nev-.j'-Times. Capt. Morey is known in this city, having relatives
here.
n the same day The News-Tiir.es carried the report that the house
had refused to accept the bill from which the senate had struck out
the part providing for government support of miliatiamen's families.
June 2 Text of Carranza's speech to 10,000 students in which he
pointed out why he had not published the American note and asked
the men Jo prepare for trouble. v
June L'y -Interpreter Spilsury's sworn statement to Carranza in
which h" blamed the Americans for the Carrizal battle. Efforts to dis
credit this statement later failed.
June JO And last but not least. The News-Times carried Friday
afternoon the complete text of the statement of facts regarding the
recent American note in which Carranza defies the United States. No
other paper in South Bend carried this note although "private advices"
confirmed it.
Above are just a rew reasons why The News-Times is always
in the forefront

Takes250y000
Teuton Troops
IntTimtionil New Srrvlre:
PKTIKKWfAI). July 1. More than
a quarter of a million Teuton sol
diers have been captured by the Rus
sian army in its rontiuueil offensive
and officials of the war oitice believe
that before there is a halt more than
4 00.000 will be taken. lp t Wed
nesday l' 12.000 prisoners had been
rt ported to the eneral staff's head
quarters, hut since that time the
Russians have advanced more than
;J0 miles in some directions, the ra
pidity of their movements prevent
ing transmission of reports on the
number of captives.
Great Britain's long awaited offen
sive against the Germans in France
has been launched. At the moment
when Russia's mighty army is con
tinuing its drive in the eastern the
ater and Italy is pouring its men for
ward against the Austrians, England
is opening its terrific smash.
For this attack Great Britain has
been preparing for two years.
Every effort of the late Eord Kitch
ener was directed toward gaining
success in this .plunge against the
German lines. Imtö Kitchener as
well as other leaders of the allies,
believed that the outcome of the war
would be decided in the western the
ater. The first attack of the British
army, made along a front of 0 miles
north of the Somme river, appears
to have been completely successful.
Frederick Palmer, the noted Amer
ican war correspondent, now at Brit
ish headquarters in France, states
that the British captured the Ger
mans first line in their initial attack
together with many prisoners.
The offensive began early today.
It came following a bombardment
lasting only an hour and a half, but
for more than a week previously the
British guns had been pouring shells
upon the Teuton trenches.

International News Seriee:
EL. PASO, Texas., July 1. Militia
forces have begun to reach the bor
der. Direct orders of Sec'y of War
Baker threw a screen of secrecy
about the movements of the troops
ai:d forbade the publication of the
number and disposition of the state
guardsmen, but it can be stated that
New England forces were the first
to reach the border.
The arrival of the militia was pre
ceded by the coming of HO officers to
prepare camp sites and report their
strength and equipment to Gen.
George Bell, jr.. commander at Fort
BUS..
The first camp sito already has
been selected by the regular army
officers. It was pitched within ea.sy
rifle range of Fort Bliss, on a stretch
of gaunt land where the sun beats
its hottest and the suffocating wind
from the hills is the only relief dur
ing the blistering day.
Watch Arrival.
The regulars who turned out to
watch with a paternal and perhaps a
twinkling eye the arrival of the
guardsmen were surprised at the
spirit of their younger brothers in
arms. Although the desert sun was
early at its scorching work, the
militiamen swung along uncomplain
ing under full packs with rifles cor
rectly aslant and anxious for service.
With the arrival of the militia the
plans for the invasion of Mexico by
another expedition marching
through Juarez may le said to be
near completion and their fulfilment
rests only with the command from
"Washington. With the full force of
militiamen assigned to this district
here, there will be ample protection
for the border points in the EI Paso
districts and the maintaining of a
border patrol that will strengthen
weak points all along the border.
The first of the militia officers,
who arrived last night, took up tem
porary headquarters at El Paso ho
tels, but they showed that they were
not going to attempt to continue the
"soft" when they turned out at day
break and joined their men in
camp. Today the hotel headquar
ters will disappear and the militia
men will come under the Ranv gen
eral order as the reg-jlar army offi
cers strictly within the boundaries
of their camps ready for instant ac
tion. Assign Militia.
The work of assigning the militia
to particular posts along the border
will be started as soon as the men
have had a chance to become accli
mated. The fear is gnwing here that Car
ranza's delay in replying to the
American note is for the purpose of
allowing his. commanders to placo
their troops in strong positions
about Gen. Pershing's expedition
army force.
Pershing, it i reported, has
drawn in his forces to be ready to
withstand with an estimated force of
between 12.000 and lo.GOO men the
