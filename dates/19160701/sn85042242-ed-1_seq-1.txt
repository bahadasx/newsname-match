NESTOS JUMPS TO
THE SECOND PLACE
Non Partisan Landslide Complete
—Frazier Nearly 10,000
Ahead
Spalding increased his lead ovdr
Justice Goss in returns from 753 pre­
cincts and Nestos has nosed out Gov­
ernor L. B. Hanna for second place
in the senatorial race. These are
the outstanding features of the latest
returns compiled by the 't ribune from
official reports by state auditors.
The former chief justice, defeated
two years ago by Judge Ciiiistianson,
has a lead of 7$9 over Goss. The
present incumbent may be able to
overcome'this in later returns. This
is the only place on the entire ticket
that is in doubt now.. Totals on the
judiciary ballot are as follows: Rob­
inson, 16,483 Birdzell, 1T,496 Burke,
15,060 Grace, 14,546 Fisk, 1S.776
Spalding, 11,182 Goss, 10,313 Adam
son 6,221.
It'seems likely that the three high
men will be Robinson, Birdzell and
Burke, although votes from rural dis­
tricts may upset this order. Not quite
half the state has been heard' from.
The elimination of the two low can­
didates not endorsed by the Non-parti­
san league will release some 32,000
votes. It is interesting speculation iti
this* struggle to control the judiciary,
to know just where this vote will go.
In the senatorial race, McCumber
continues tb Increase his lead. From
1792 out of 1,800 precincts the vote
stands:
iMoCumber 22,755
Nestos 13,337
Hanna 13,124
Frazier has nearly 10,000 votes over
Burdick in 1,409 out of 1,800 precincts.
It looks now as though he would have
a majority over Burdick, Fraine and
Smith and that his lead over Burdick
would reach at least 15,000. The vote

Frazier's Statement.
Lynn J. Frazier, Republican nomi­
nee for governor, made the following
statement over the long distance tele­
phone from his home at Hoople:
"i want to express my apprecia­
ted of the loyalty of the farmers of
the state to their cause, as shown by
the- vote in the primary election. The
rural vote shows beyond a question
that the farmers of the state are deep­
ly interested in the issues of this cam­
paign and that they can stick togeth­
er.
"I feel grateful also for the support
of the workingmen and others in the
cities, who helped materially by their
votes to bring about this splendid re­
sult that has been achieved.
"The result is. a plain expression of
the will qf the Republican voters of
North Dakota and we who have been
nominated by the rank and file of the
party owe no duty to any but the
common, citizens of the state.
"1 feei sure hat we shall go forward
to a sweeping victory in the fall elec­
tion and I shall do my best to merit
the confidence in me shown by the
people of the state."
Light Democratic Vote.
Meagre returns on the Democratic
ticket indicate a light vote, with Pla
tou gaining some over McArthur. In
444 precincts, McArthur has 1,223,
while in 351 precincts, Platou has
904. Halvorson's vote in 444 precincts
is 692.
John Burke is leading Hellstrom in
471 precincts. The vote is: Burke,
2,618 Hellstrom. 1,037.
On the balance of the state ticket,
late returns merely pile up the ma­
jorities. Langer has 10,000 majority
over Linde. All the'Non-partisan1can­
didates for state offices have won as
announced in yesterday's Tribune f*y
decisive majorities.
McDonald leads .Hoover by a big
•ate. Both go on the ballot in No­

London, June 30.—Success for the
Entente Allies on the tliree most im­
portant European fronts are chroni­
cled in the latest official communica­
tions. The French and British con­
tinue their raids against the Germans
in France, the French have captured
the Thiaumont woods northeast of
Verdun, and the British have kept up
their bombardments of the German
trenches. The Russians have taken
Kolomea, an important railroad junc­
tion, leading to Lemberg in Galicia,
and the Italians continue to advance
against the Austrians tn the Trentino
regions.
The struggle for the possession of
the Thiaumont woods, taken by the
crown prince's forces from the French
a few weeks ago, was most severe,
the position changing hands several
times.
Violent bombardments mark the
fighting on the fronts around Verdun,
particularly on Hill No. .'!04.
British Destroying Trenches.
The British are keeping up their
tactics of destroying by artillery fire
German first and second line trenches
from Ypres to the Somme. Unofficial­
ly, it is reported that the Fritish are
expending more than a million shells
a day in this work.
In addition to the capture of Kolo­
mea, the Russians also have taken
the town of Obertino, northeast of
Kolomea, and several other villages
north and south of that point. On
the front in Russia from the Galician
border to the region of Riga there
have been battles at various points.

Information of Movements
Troops To Be With-
COMP
Col, John H. Fraine of the First reg­
iment, North Dakota national guard,
yesterday received a telegram from
high officials with orders to the effect
that in the future absolutely no infor­
mation as to the movements or man­
euvers pf the regiment shall be made
known. This evidently means that
the United States is contemplating a
move of some sort, but just what it
is remains a matter of conjecture.
War officials undoubtedly expect to
have the troops break camp and move
in a hurry when they do advance to
the border pnd wish to keep their
movements secret.
It is not expected that tne North
Dakota militia will be called for at
least a week, although this is merely
a matter of supposition, and in case
an outbreak occurred, they would prob­
ably be entrained immediately and
rushed to the Mexican frontier with
all haste.
1,113 Now Enlisted.
Official announcement was made at
post quarters late yesterday afternoon
to the effect that. 1,133 officers and
men are now encamped at Ft. Lincoln.
Several officers arrived during the
past two days and are now with their
companies and applications for enlist­
ment are being received daily and act­
ed upon at once.
Two Companies Mustered In.
Company of Valley City, Capt. D.
S. Ritchie in command, was the first
company to be mustered into the ser­
vice of the United States army. The
crack company from Valley City be­
came full-fledged soldiers yesterday
afternoon. Company of Fargo, com­
manded by Capt. G. A. M. Anderson,
was also mustered in yesterday after­
noon.
These two companies were inoculat­
ed with typhoid antitoxin and both
will be off duty for 24 hours.

The unconciliatory character of a memorandum published in
