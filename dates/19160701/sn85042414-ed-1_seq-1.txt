Robert Cecil's announcement in the
British parliament of Great Britain's
abandonment of the Declaration of
London, the full purport of. the an
nouncement became known in Ger
many only yesterday.
Newspapers in commenting on the
action, treat it as a matter of no
great practical importance momen
tarily for Germany, as they regard
the declaration as already having
been virtually emasculated to suit
Great Britain's purpose.
They see only an open admission of
the fact they ddmred already exist
ent, that so far as England was con
cerned, International law is merely
England's will.

LONDON IS JOYOUS
OVER THE SUCCESS

Continent Will be
Regulated.
London, July 1.—"An attack was
launched north of the River Somme
this morning in conjunction with the
French." says the official announce
ment today. "The British troops, have
broken into the German forwkrd sys
tem of defenses on a front of 16
miles."
...Fighting Is continuing, the French
attack on our immediate right- pro
ceeding 'equally satisfactorily. On the
"remainder^ of the British front raid
ing parties have again succeeded In
penetrating the enemy's defenses at
many points, inflicting losses on the
enemy, and taking some prisoners.
Traffic Regulated.
The war office also announoed that
It was necessary that passenger traffic
between Great Britain and the conti
nent be regulated closely and reduced
as far as possible. Only those having
a serious reason are permitted to
travel. To prevent the transmission
of naval and military information, all
passengers' baggage will be searched.
News of the great offensive spread
throughout London like wildfire,
creating the greatest enthusiasm.

passengers on tops of busses cheered
the news and men, women and chil
dren In little groups scanned the spe
cial editions and then broke into out
bursts of cheering.
The menace of the British attack Is
fully appreciated in Germany, accord
ing to newspaper comments from Ber
lin, but the utmost confidence Is ex
pressed in the ability of the Germans
to meet, and crush it. The Allies are
now on offensive practically on every
field of the war. The British assault

110 EXPECTED MM
Big Drive Begins.
The tremendous offensive launched
by the British Is the culmination of a
five days bombardment which, in the
amount of ammunition expended and
in the territory involved exceeds any
thing of the kind previously known
in the world war.
For some weeks reports have been
current In England and France, that
the "big push" of the British was
about to commence. It was stated
England had two million men. fully
equipped and trained, in preparation
for the supreme effort to break the
German lines. Over a million shells
are declared to have been fired daily
in the preliminary bombardment ex
tending over a front of 90 miles.
The front selected for the British
offensive was decided upon many
weeks ago. This is the first time since
the outbreak of the war that the in
tention of an army to .undertake an
offensive has been so well advertised.
A week ago the German attacks
at Verdun were making further head
way, and it was feared that the allies'
situation there was dangerous. Then
the British guns began to apeak. 8ince
then thblr bombs have been contin
ually falling except during the hours
the British Infantrymen were raiding
the German trenches.

ENGLISH ATTACK CAPTURES
20 MILES OF FRONT UNE OF
TRENCHES FROM TIE TEUTONS
British Headquarters in France, July 1.—A
ous British offensive has been launched along a front txJ
tending for 20 miles north of the Somme. The British oc-^
cupied the German front line trenches and captured many}
prisoners. The British casualties so far are comparatively^
light.
ALLIES PROGRESS.
The British have already captured Serre Montauban.
The Germans hold Fricourt, Ovillers and Beaumont-Ha
mel. The British have begun afresh attack on Beaumont
Hamel. There is an intense struggle also in progress for
the possession of Contalmaison, one end of which the Brit
ish hold with the Germans on the other. The British have
taken Laboiselle. The French, co-operating to the south,
have captured Curlvi and Faviere Woods. All the main
first line trenches are reported taken. Some points in the
operations have now reached the main second line.
The British have moved against a strong position
northwest of Thiepval, and are attacking fiercely in an ef
fort to. surround .it important German position at'Fri
ctatri tttay be ctit off.
BOMBARDMENT FIRST.
A terrific bombardment preceding the attack this
morning lasted an hour and a half. The fighting is develop
ing in intensity.
The artillery bombardment of the last few days
concentrated this morning with a degree of fury
number of guns which is unprecedented in the region oft
Albert and Somme. with the French co-operating
to thei
south.
ATTACK BEGINS.
At 5:30 o'clock, through the clouds of smoke and dust
hanging over the whole field as far as the eye could
see,
the infantry sprang from the trenches for an assault over
a front of 20 miles.
Already it has gained the first line of trenches and the
advance is continuing.
The new British trench mortars, which fire 35 shots
a minute, have played a great part, cutting wire entangle
ments and destroying trenches.
A large number of prisoners were taken. Some prison
ers said the British curtain of fire had prevented them«
from getting food fort the last five days.
GALLANT ADVANCE.
A British staff officer who witnessed the advance at
the junction of French and British lines, said the
attack
was launched as though the men were on parade.
Simultaneously with the launching of the British of
fensive. the French infantry advanced to the attack. This
movement of the French line was inaugurated over the
section adjoining the junction point with the British front.
