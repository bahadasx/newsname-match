LONDON". Jnly 1?After weeks of
intense bombardment with guns of
every caliber firing a million shells
daily, the British early this morning
launched a general offensive against
the German lines along a front of .
twenty miles north of the river
Somme. They suceeded in taking1
the German front line trenches and !
capturing many men.

Jxmg Planned.
The front selected for the British j
offensive was decided on many
months ago and the bombardment of!
the lines as well as the frequent
raids which procured important in- '
formation as to the disposition of the
Germans was designed to keep the ;
German generals uncertain as to the ;
point at which they would be called ,
upon to meet the brunt of the ac- '
tack.
This is the first time since the out- ;
break of the war that the intention |;
of an army to undertake an offensive '
has been so well advertised. A week .
ago when the German attacks against "
Verdun began to make further head- .
way and it was feared the army of :
the crown prince was getting within ;
a distance of Verdun which was dangerous
for the Allies, the British
guns began to speak. Since then ex- .

fantrymen were raiding German; :

News Causes Excitement.
The news of the British offensive,
which was quickly circulated in London.
created the greatest enthusiasm
and details of the battles are being
anxiously awaited- Only this morning
the correspondent at the front for
British newspapers, while writing of
the British artillery and raiding successes,
warned the- public that an advance
must be made by infantry and
not by artillery and that the British
army could not expect to come
put of the engagement scathless. First
accounts of the battle, however, state
that the British casualties were - not
I heavy.
The news spread throughout London
like wildfire. There was a frantic
rush to obtain special editions of
the evening newspapers.

FRENCH RECAPTURE
POSITIONS IN ATTACK
(BY ASSOCIATCD PKCCS)
PARIS. July 1.?After four violent
attacks -with, liquid fire the Germans
succeeded In capturing the positions
east of hill 304 which were taken, by
the French Friday. The French made
a counter attack and recaptured the j
positions, according to an official
statement issued by the war office
today. After several assaults the Germans
succeeded in penetrating the
works around Thiaumont which were
captured by the French yesterday.
The approaches to Thiaumont are
still in the hands of the French.
On the west of the Meuse flghting
of great violence lasted throughout the
night in the neighborhood of the
Esnes-Harcourt road. The Germans
attacked heavily both east and west
of hill 304 but most of their attacks
were repulsed- Xancy was bombarded
by German long range guns.

INSORSHIP
As It Desires World to Know
the Truth About the War
in That Country.
HEARQUARTERS OF THE ITALIAN
ARMY. July 1.?(Correspondence ,
of The Associated Press).?The Ital-;
ian censorship has been reorganized i
and vastly Improved, particularly from j
a newspaper point of view. Little cen

matter coming from or going to ally
countries, such as France or England,
but every mailed letter or package
going to or coming from the United
States and Switzerland is opened and i
read. The consors, however, are some- 1
times courteous enough to notify a
person sending suspected matter that i
it is being held for explanation. In
the case of cable messages, the censor
tries his best to let them go through,
either holding the message for a time
before sending it. or else cutting out
ebjectionable information, sending the
message in the new form, and then
notifying the sender what portions
hortions have been eliminated.
One of the reasons for the more
favorable attitude of ihe Italian censorship
is anabatement of the syp
mania and the realization that this
class of information is not as harmful
as was formerly supposed.
Spread the Truth.
Another reason has been the influence
of certain officers, patriotic Journalists
and business men who feel
that Italy has not been fully understood
in this war and that correspondence
both of private individuals and
newspaper me nvisiting or living in
the country would, if not too severely
censored, let the outside world know
the truth about conditions and the reasons
for Italy's war.
a rtjroot result of tTiis attitude has
been the establishment recently at the
headquarters of the army of a press
bureau. One of the first steps taken
by the officers in charge was to secure
permission for both ally and neutral
journalists to visit the army front
and see the fruits of Italy's effort to'
organize a splendid new army- Previous
to the existence of this bureau
but very few civilians had been allowed
on the Italian front. The impression
had gotten abroad that Italy
did not want her front visited and
therefore no requests to visit it had
been made, particularly by neutrals.
Visitors Well Treated.
The visitors at present admitted on
the front, once the officers of the
press bureau had satisfied themselves
these visitors are without unfriendly
intentions, are shown fully and freely
all that they wish'to see. In the handling
of newspaper copy written from
the front, the largest latitude is permitted
the writers. Restrictions
about jnamlng geographical - locations,
are cast aside.'since It is-evident that

North America.
It has been conclusively shown
that those traveling men whose
minds and habits are clean sell more
goods and at less percentage of cost
and are always at their highest efficiency.
In the last five years the Gideons'
have doubtless done more than any
other one organization outside of
the church, to strengthen the morals
of the traveling man. Untold numbers
of discouraged, sorely tempted
commercial travelers have been saved
from falling, from sorrow and death
by the Gideon hotel Bibles, of which
325.000 have been placed in more
than 2.000 of the leading hotels of
America. All should co-operate in
the extension of this work which
makes better, cleaner and more successful
commercial travelers and
brings hope and joy to all who come
in touch with it.
On Sunday. July 2. at 2:30 p. m.,
the Clarksburg Gideons will hold a
meeting at the First Presbyterian
church. After this service the 300
Bibles which are on exhibition in
a window of the Parsons-Souders department
store, will be placed by the
Gideons in the hotels of the city. All
are invited to his service.

hundred miles of front, it would be
difficult to bide from tbem the names
of the rivers and mountains and towns
along the front.
The pres sbureau, although not
long formed, has already justified itself,
it is stated, in the better understanding
by France and England of
the terrific difficulties under which the
Italian army works in mountain territory,
where it takes weeks to move
large bodies of troops or put artillery
into new positions, and where the taking
of a single mountain involves the
patient effort and staunch heroism of
months of hard fighting.
>~nmbers Are Used.
The numbers frequently referred to
in official military bulletins, in con
nection -with operations at places the
names of 'which are not mentioned,
has given rise to the popular impression
that the number is used, in order
to withhold exact Information as to
the geography of the operations.
As a matter of fact, and particularly
in mountain operations, the use of
a number conveys the most exact and
accurate information. Every hilltop
and mountain in Europe has long been
identified by a number. This number
is not an arbitrary one. It is the exact
height in meters?(one metei is
39.37 inches)?of th chllltop or mountain
above the sea level- As no such
hilltops or mountains have the same
height, the numbers are never the
same, at least in the seme range of'
