Werman Drive on Verdun Has
Been Resumed
With Increased
Fierceness.
THE FIGHTING IS BLOODY
PARIS, July 1.—The crown prince
has resumed the drive on Verdun
with the most powerful attacks on
both banks of the Mouse, the wac of
fice announced today. The most vio
lent fighting In many- weeks has de
veloped on the northwest sectors of
the fortress.
In a series of terrific attacks west
of the Meuse the Germans captured a
fortified work and elements of con
necting trenches in fighting east of
Hill 304. French counter attacks
later regained all the lost ground.
Bast of the Meuse the Germans
again penetrated Thiaumont work,
which was captured by the French
yesterday. The redoubt Itself was en
tirely smashed in by tetrrifflc artil
lery fire. The French retain the out
skirts.
The French official statement, it
is to be noted, is silent on the opera
tions near the Somne, where French,
and British armies have begun a gi
gantic offensive^
The Germans resumed the attack
on the west bank of the Meuse to
ward evening last night. The entire
region east aUd weet be
came the scene of the bloodiest fight
ing.
The Germans launched four differ
ent attacks. The first, preceded by
liquid fire, was directed against a
French position between Hill 304 and
the Esnes-Haucourt road. This on
slaught was repulsed, the Germans
losing heavily.
In the second attack, the enemy
swarmed forward in compact masses,
attempting to carry French positions
west of the Esnes-Haucourt highway.
This attack also was repulsed.
After a brief respite, marked only
by intense cannonading, the Germans
directed a most powerful thrurt
against the French lines east of Hill
304. It was in this fighting that the
enemy captured the French fortified
work, which was later retaken.
Early this morning the Germans
launched the fourth attack against
the Avocourt redoubt. This attack
was speedily stopped by French fire.
East of the Mteuse, the battle that
has raged unceasingly for two days
for possession of the Thiaumont work
continued throughout last night. De

NEW YORK, July 1.—Under Ini
tial circumstances that are highly
'favorable, the long awaited Anglo
French offensive is now in full oper

tact, will, probably be dated from to
day.
The "Brunt of the fighting In the
western sector is falling on the Brit
ish armies. The attack of the French
troops on the right Is little more
than a sympathetic movement and a
protection of the British flank.
The meagre official statement this
afternoon suggests the British have
gained an average depth of perhaps
two miles along a sixteen mile front.
This is a large victory for such few
hours of the fighting. It is not
probable British armies expect prog

but a few advances of this nature

into serious confusion.
It is as yet too early to determine

been the most hampering fact of the

"WASHINGTON, July 1.—Income,

to pay the cost of preparedness. If
there is a war, the cost will be paid
for by bond issues.
Shifting the burdens almost entire

incomes, the new revenue bill to be
Introduced in the house today is
epoch-making In the opinion of admin
istration leaders. It will establish a
national Inheritance tax as a perma
nent part of the fiscal system of this
country.
Experts say the new bill will recom
mend approximately $210,000,000 ad
ditional revenue—$100,000,000 from
incomes, $60,000,000 from Inheritances
and 450,000,000 from munitions.
The present normal tax rate Is
boosted from one to two per cent. Tho
super-taxes will begin at $20,000 and
will increase at the rate of one per
cent on each classification, until ten
per cent is levied on all Incomes in
excess of $500,000. The inheritance
tax provisions will exempt all estates
under $50,000 if the testator was a
resident of the state in which the
property lies. If a non-resident, there
will be no exemption. Tbe tax rates
are on© per cent for estates under
$50,000 two per cent for estates be
tween $5-0?000 and $150,000 three per
cent between $50,00 and $25,000 four
per cent between $250,000 and $400,000
and five per cent on estates In excess
of $450,000. 0 The bill Is so drafted as
not to interfere with the purely state
inheritance tax laws now on the
statute books.
Varying states of taxation are Im
posed on munition factories. If re
ceipts of a paint manufacturing gun
powder and explosives do not exceed
a million dollars, a tax of five per
cent Is laid. Bight per cent Is de

MEXICO CITY, July 1.—The Mex
ico City newspapers today vigoorusly
approved the statement gfven out yes
terday by Foreign Secretary Aguilar
commenting upon and refuting asser
tions in the American note.
The foreign office statement was
published In the same editions with
the American note, which was thus
given to the public for the first time.
The newspapers printed first a para
graph of President Wilson's communi
cation and then inserted a paragraph
of Secretary Agullar's reply answer
ing that particular charge.
Officials said today that the tone of
Agullar's statement was frilly Justified
because of the tone of the American
note. They complained that the
United States has sent several ex
tremely sharp and undiplomatic mes
sages to the Mexican government
and said that they had withheld pub
lication of many of these communica
tions because they did not wish to
stir up hostility to the United States.
The foreign office announced today
that immediately upon receipt of in
formation that Secretary Lansing had
issued fresh warning for Americans
to leave Mexico,- instructions were
telegraphed to all civil and military
authorities to give guarantees \of pro
tection to all Americans and other
foreigners within their Jurisdiction.
The war office has received from
General' Trevlno a complete official
report of the encounter at Gaxrizal,
confirming the statement of the Mor
mon guide. Lent Spillsbury, that the
Americans were the aggressors.
This version of the lOarrizai clash
not only supports the previous Mexi

but gives the new allegation that Cap

march to Villa Airumada in the face

It was an official report of lieuten

to the point of dictation In the affairs
of another people?
From this and other strong utter
ances along the same line, the presi
dent is said by his friends today to
have Indicated clearly he will not
countenance war between the United
States and Mexico sav as an unavoid
able resort in settling border troubles.
For the second time In as many
days, he said he would stake his per
sonal fortunes upon the ideal he is
following In Mexico.
For the first time the president in
dicated what may be in his mind as
to the immediate purpose of concen
trating such large forces on fhe boi
der.
"Force" he said, "can sometimes
hold things steady until opinion has
had time to form. No force ever
exerted except in response to that
opinion was ever a conquering and
predominating force."
And thus the president last night,
throwing off his customary restraint,
expounded his creed. It is one of
peace, supported as ho said by a vast
majority of the letters and messages
sent to him from men and women In
all parts of the country urging and
praying that he avoid hostilities in
Mexico. The president indicated he
will go to extreme lengths of diplo
matic resources before he resort to
the use of arms in forcing Mexico to
cooperate with this oountry in pro
tecting its own people.
