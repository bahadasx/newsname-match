JULY 4th
MESSAGE TO THE AMERICAN PATRIOTS.
A
The one, refreshing oasis in
that world of desert of impending
ruin and desolation is our Repub
He; the glorious date July 4tli, the
stirring records of the birth
struggles of the declaration of
American independence. Every
4th of July iB a re-dedication, a
lecousecratiou of the spirit of
seventy six to humanity's free
dom. Time is kind to the Temple
of liberty; its veetal fires still
glowing in the zeal and fervor of
he fathers of the Republic. The
first celebration represented the
same Ideal of government, the
same principle of divine right of
man to life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness than the one of to day
called nationalism, preparedness,
disciplined coordinated patriotism.
The new spirit In new cloth; the
uew term, the new issue, a recru
descence of the Name vital ques
tion, the agony of the same na
tional sont and conscience of our
national birth.
The right to have a government
born of the consent of the govern
ed has always been challenged by
autocrat, by greed and privilege.
The sovereignty of free, nutramel.
ed citizenship, free from allegi
ance to entranched dynasties to
crowned arrogauce of usurping
ruler, separated from the wither
iog, blighting influences of eus
tom, tradition, history, has been
condemned, outlawed, by might,
power, position. Democracy, the

of onr age, the mighty legion of a

SHORTAGE OF
PAPER MATERIAL.
Save Your Waste Paper and
Rags.
The attention of the Depart
ment of Commerce is called, by
the president of a large paper
manufacturing company, to the
fact that there is a serious short
age of raw material for the manu
facture of paper, including rags
and old papers. He urges that
the Department should make it
known that the collecting of sav
ing old rags and old papers won Id
greatly better existing conditions
for American manufacturers.
Something like 15,000 tons of
different kinds of paper and paper
board are manufactured every day
in the United Slates and a large
proportion of this, after it has
served its purpose, could be used
over again in some class of paper.

COMMISSION
GOVERNMENT.
After trying ont commission
government, Denver, Colorado,
has reverted to tbe old form. The
change is accompanied by the
statement that the trouble was
with tbe personnel of tbe commis
sioners and not with the commis,
sion method. This is a troth
that will be commonly recoguized
—that a commission government
in tbe bands of the wrong men, of
the average city politicians, is far
more susceptible of abase, waste,
and of the power, too, of perpetn
ating itself through ring politics,
than the ward alderman rule
Also, commission government is
ever so much less representative
and responsive to public opinion,
and ever so much easier to be used
by public utilities anti special in
tercets.—Vicksburg Herald.

ronation of the Goddess of Liber
ty. That we meet with shocks
rebuffs, humiliation is hut the ra
tional result of human nature
With the bulk and weight of man
kiud in chains, shackled by centn
nesof prejudices, fetiches, burned
into the very life of these plod
ding races, the United States, by
reason of its potential strength,
its unassailable position, seems to
be the chosen instrument, a some
what diviuely appointed agency
to undertake and complete the
work of liberation, redemption and
salvation. This year, every word
of the many 4th of July orations,
will be a message to the fighting
soldier in the trench; to the grim
warrior behind the gun; to the af
flicted nation in war's agony. It
will be a consolation to those
prostrated by gloom, darkness and
despair. Into our bauds, into our
keeping is consigned the defense,
the protection, the hope of the
spark of liberty which as a sue
cessful dynastic war threatens to
throttle, to extinguish, to smother.
These free offerings on a free,
bloodless altar of liberty are sym
bols not of a limited Americanism
but of a uew religion whose pray
ers aud hymns will be merged into
the grand symphony that calls all
peoples to its common standard.
For home and country nothing is too
dear.
For them no enemy need freeman
fear.

THE PARTING
OF THE WAYS.
Among the dispatches from the
state capital Percy Saiui, of
Franklin, La , the floor leader of
the Progressives in the House,
and Senator G. J. Labarre, Pro
gressive from AHsnmption, ex
pressed the belief Tuesday that
the Progressives of Louisiana will
not follow Roosevelt into the Re
publican party and support
Hughes for the presidency.
U I believe the overwhelming
sentiment will be to bold our par
ty intact in Louisiana," said Mr
Saint. "We are not Republican*
and will not go to Hughes, and the
Democrats by the legislation in
this session have closed the doors
on ns—so there is nothing left for
us to do. We will return Whn
Martin to Congress in the Third
district. My belief iB that John
M. Parker expressed the senti
ment of Louisiana Progressives."
