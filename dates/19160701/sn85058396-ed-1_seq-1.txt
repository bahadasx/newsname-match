1 British Headquarters In France,
July 1 Reports received from the
front up to 12:30 o'clock, five hours
after the combined French and British
offensive was launched, 6bowed that
the allies liad captured the towns of
La Boiselle, Serre and Montauban
and Curlu and Favjere woods. The,
main first line trenches over the en
tire front under attack are reported
to havebeen stormed and at various
points the fighting has reached the
main second line.
These reports show that the French
and British at the points of their fur
thest advances have broken through a
distance of more than five miles be
yond the first German trenches.. Mon
tauban Js five and a half miles east
I of the old British front and Curlu
wood is six miles east southeast of
Albert.
Intense Struggle Underway.
The Britis hare endeavoring to sur
round Thiepeval and at other points
an Intense struggle is under way for
towns and villages Reports from
the front Indicate that the important
German position at Fricourt may be
t cut off.
At this hour the British are mak-
tt ing good progress behind the front
lines in German-held territory. Serre
j and Montauban, which the British
have captured, are important tactical
points. Serre is southeast of Hebu
1 terae and Montauban is northeast of
Bray. The British are fighting for
the villages of Mametz and Contal
maison, portions of which they hold.
British Fighting Gallantly.
The British are endeavoring to sur
and have taken many prisoners in the
frunt lines.
The French, advancing on the Brit
I ish right, are moving with great stead
iness. After the assault, they very
i nuickly covered a distance of two kil
ometers- beyond the German second
line. Thus far the day has gone well
for France and England.
J Under a pall of shell smoke with
i v the unbroken roar of artillery, the
struggle on the longest line of offen
sive yet undertaken on the western
front, which begun at 7:30 o'clock
f this morning, Is continued at this
hour.
From a hill the Associated Press
correspondent watched tho beginning
r of the battle.
f Immense Numbers In Attack.
Notwithstanding the fact that
troops have been moved to the front
in immense numbers for tho attack,
t there are still remaining billets in the
, rear which apparently are unneces
sary in working out the present
I plans. ,. ,
Wltn deliberate and methodical pre
cision, the gathering of human and
i mechanical material proceeded, me
8" whole line was Included In the pre
, Hmlnarv bombardment for the purpose
of deceiving the Germans as to the
point of attack.
Infantry Swarms Trenches.
Overwhelming as was the power of
the guns, the significant spectacle
was detachments of infantry, in Ilel
fighting equipment, moving forward
until finally the dugouts were hives
or unaKi auout 10 'u' ii
1 battle. Each of the officers had maps
I and directions in detail of the part
i his unit was to play in the complicat
ed scheme of attack. The men had
sewed In their uniforms insignia of
different units.
As the battalions moved they sang
Hie tunes they used to sing on the
drill grounds at home.
Simultaneously with the launching
of the British offensive French Infan
try advanced to the attack. This move
raent of French troops was inaugur
; ated over a section of the French lino
: adjoining the Junction point with tno
Biitish front.
Bombardment of Unprecended Fury.
: ' The artillery bombardment of in 6
last few days was concentrated urn
morning with a degree of fury ana a
number of guns which were unpre
cedented in the region of Albert ana
the Somme with the French co-opera.
Uon to the south. , , .
At 7:30 o'clock, through clouds of
! smoke and dust which hung over tue
I hole field as far as the eye could see,
,f ' ,tho infantry Bprang from the trenches
for an assault on a front of over twen
ty miles. Already it has gained pos
session of the first line trenches and
the advance is continuing.
Mortars Fire 35 Shells a Minute.
The new British mortars, which fire
35 shells a minute, playea a great part,
cutting wire entanglements and de
stroying trenches.
Large numbers of prisoners have
been taken. Some of the prisoners
say the British curtains of fire pre.
vented them from getting food for
the last five days.
A British staff officer who wit
nessed the advance at the junction of
the French and British lines said the
attack was launched as though tlio
men were on parade.
Raid by Colonials.
A raid by Australian and New Zea
land troops on the German lines last
night resulted in the killing of about
80 German soldiers, including two offi
cers. The British casualties wero
slight.
The Germans made an Ineffective
raid on British trenches to the west
ward of Lille road, after a heavy bombardment.
made three raids in the neighborhood
of Mesnes and accounted for a number
of Germans. The King's Shropshire j
light infantry made an expedition into
the German lines and returned with a
dozen prisoners.
London, July 1. 1 p. m After weeks
ot Intense bombardment with guns of
everv caliber, firing a million" shells
dally, the British early this morning
launched a general offensive against
the German line along a front of twen
tv miles north of the river Somme.
They succeeded in taking the Gorman
front line trenches and capturing
1I1UII IUCI1.
The French on the British right co
operated in the attack. When the
last dispatches thus far received left
British headquarters the fighting was
still progressing and further succes
ses, It was said, were being record
ed. The Iront selected for tho British
offensive was decided upon many
weeks ago and the bombardment of
the rest of the line, as well as the
frequent raids which procured for
British headquarters Important infor
mation yas to the disposition of the
Germans, was designed to keep the
Gefman generals uncertain as to the
point at which they would be called
upon to meet the brunt of the attack.
Tlfis Is the first time since the out
break of the war that the Intention
of an army to undertake an offensive
has been so well advertised. A week
ago when the German attacks against
Verdun began to make further head
way and It was feared the army of
the crown prince was gettiug within
a distance of Verdun which was dang
erous for theallies. the British guns
began to speak. Since then, except
for the hours when British infantry
men were raiding German trenches, a
continual bombardment has been
maintained.
Innumerable Batteries Take Turn.
Batteries, wnicu jiu c -
able, took turns at smashing the Ger
man defenses, destroying communi
cation trenches and blowing up am
munition depots. New trench mort
ars, particularly destructive, tore awa
wire entanglements, broke down para
pets and generally opened the way for
men with rifles and bayonets. Big
runs of 15 Inches and other large cali
bers prevented the Germans trom
bringing up supports, wrecking every
thing within range.
Two Towns Destroyed.
The artillery fire was particularly
intense on a stretch of the front north
of the Somme and earlier dispatches
told of the destruction of the towns
of Thiepval and Bcaucourt, where the
Germans had concentrated ammuni
tion. Early this morning more guns
were brought Into action on this twen
ty' mile sector and for an hour and a
half the Germans were subjected to
fbombardment which Is described
the fiercest experienced in this ar
of heavv artillery.
This morning the correspondents ;at
j the front for British newspapers, v-lilie
writingof the British artillery and
raiding successes, warned the public
that an advance must be made by In
fantry and not by artillery and that
the British army could not expect to
come out of the engagement scathe
less. First accounts of the battle
however, state that the British casu
alties were not heavy.
The news spread throughout Lon
don like wildfire. There was a fran
tic rush to obtain special editions of
the evening newspapers
British Fight Continues.
London, July 1, 7-46 a. m "An at
tack was launched north of the river
Somme at 7'o0 o'clock In conjunction
with the French," says an official
announcement given out here today
"British troops have broken into the
German forward system of detense on
a front of . be teen miles.
"The fighting is continuing. The
French attack on our immediate right
is proceeding equally satisfactorily.
"On the remainder of the British
front raiding parties again succeeded
in penetrating the enemy's defenses
at many points, inflicting loss on the
enemy and taking some prisoners."
Tho war office announced that the
necessary passenger traffic between
Great Britain and the continent would,
be regulated closely and reduced as
far as possible. Only those having
serious reasons are permitted to
travel.
Facing 800 000 Germans.
The number of Germans opposing
the British front and in reserve behind
the lines was estimated a month ago
at 800,000.
The sector of the German front on
which the British have assumed the
offensive forms a considerable bulge
in the British line. The southern end
rests on the Somme. It Is a broad
rolling country, over which the British
are pushing, altogether different from
the flat niarslry and bleak aspect of
j Flanders. Its rounded chalk hills are
densely wooded.
I At many points on this sector of
the British front It Is possible to see
the trenches of the Germans winding
about the opposite slopes.
A military expert writing on the of-
fnnclvo Ofirc
"It is safe to say the Germans never
expected a great attack In this coun
try. We may hope, therefore, for a
reduction of the salient there and the
securing of better strategic positions.
Far more important than that, it is
certain this attack will be very de
structive to the morale of the German
troops."
Five-Day Bombardment.
The tremendous offensive which has
been launched by the British army
on the German front is the culmina
tion of a five-day bombardment which,
in the amount of ammunition expend-
ceeds anything of the kind that has
been previously known in the world
war.
2,000,000 Men Ready.
For some weeks reports have been
current In England and France that
the 'big push" of the Biitish was about
to commence It was slated that Eng
land had 2,000,000 men fully equipped
and trained in preparation for the su
preme effort to break the German
lines. More than 1,000,000 shells are
declared to have been fired daily In
the preliminary bombardment which
extended over a front 90 miles In
length.
The allies are now on the offensive
in practicably every field of tho ar
The British assault comes on the heels
of the great successes won by the
Russians in Galicia and Bukowiua
which have resulted in completely
driving the Austrlaps trom Bukowina
and are still continuing. On the Ital
ian front the central powers have
also met with severe roverses and for
several days the Italians have been
steadily driving the Austrlans from
position after position In the Treu
tlno. The defense also of Verdun by
the French appear to have stiffened
and the balance of battle in that bit
terly congested sector appears recent
ly to have swayed in favor of the de-
fnnrlers.

Washington, July 1. Unless Gen

ered probable President Wilson will

.It was nlain that administration offi

receive word of when the Mexican

mand for a prompt reply went to Mexi
co City last Sunday.
Strong assurances may bo given In
the Mexican reply, It Is believed by of
ficials here, of the de facto govern
ment's ability to protect the bolder
against further raids. The Mexican
embassy stated fifty thousand troops
would be available for this purpose If
the American forco Is withdrawn.
Awaiting Carranza's Reply.

were at a standstill while the United
Slates government awaited Impatient

and the only intimation reaching here
