j The text of the statement follows:
'On both banks of the Meuse the
enemy delivered repeated violent of
j tensive actions. Last night on the left
bank in the entire region east and
t west of Hill 301 the lighting was par
ticularly intense. The Germans,
launxhed four attacks upon different
sectors. The first attack accompaniel
by jets of liquid fire upon our posi
tions between Hill 304 and the Ksnes
Haucourt road was repulsed with san
guinary losses for the enemy.
"The second attack was in the
neighborhood of the Ecnes-IIaucourt
road was also repulsed.
"During the night east of Hill "04
a powerful German infantry action had
succeeded in capturing a fortified work
which had been taken by us yester
day, together with some trenches on
the slopes east of Hill 304 but our
counter attacks, immediately launched,
restored the work and terrain to us
entirely.
'"Finally this morning we repulsed
with success a German attack which
attempted to reach the redoubt of Avo
court and we inflicted severe losses.
"On the right bank the combats in
progress yesterday in the Thiaumont
sector continued fiercely for possession
of the works of that name. After fur
ious assaults, preceded by bombard
ments the Germans again succeeded in
penetrating the redoubt which was
completely wrecked but we established
ourselves in the immediate approaches.
Heavy artillery activity continued in
the regions of the Fumin and Chenois

London, July 1 Dr. Bernhard Dern

important conference with Hungarian
bankers and shipping men in Buda

plan provides that Austrian and Ger

of American banks which will be ask

Springfield, TIL, Jnly 1. The
last section of the train oarryinar
the First cavalry ot" the Illinois
national guard to the Mexican bor
der pulled out of Springfield at
9:30 this morning after a delay of
nearly fifteen hours. .The cavalry,
men had spent the night sleeping
on the streets and sidewalks sur

while the train was being made up.
With between 5,000 and 6,000 Illi

of all the state troops, and Lieutenant
Colonel E. M. Lewis, commanding the
L'nited States army mustering staff
here, were prepairing today to send
the remaining 6,000 guards to San An

Railroads Cause Delay.
The lack of proper transportation
facilities has become a serious prob
lem, according to a telegram sent by
Governor Dunne to Secretary of War
Baker last nighL There was a 12
hour delay in moving the Seventh in
fantry yesterday and even greater de
loy in the case of the First cavalry,
which finally got away this morning.
Sleeping on station platforms and
on city streets has not only worn the
men out physically, but has dampened
their spirits and as one high officer at
Camp Dunne expressed it this morn
ing, "the men don't care now whether
they are sent to the border or to their
homes."
A few days aeo enlisted men and
officers actually begged to be sent to
the bord.er. The Fourth and Third
infantry regiments, comprising the
downstate troops, will depart tomor
row morning and Monday morning,
respectively if trains are available, it
was stated unofficially but authenti
cally here today.
Await Recognition.
The departure of the two field ar
tillery battalions is being delayed by
the failure of the war department to
recognize A. battery of Danville, but
Colonel Lewis expected to receive the
order of recognition at any hour tc
day. Immediately afterward the bat

Joslyn Fails
to Entangle
Harry Carl in
Waukegan, 111., July 1. Whenever,
In the trial of William. H. Orpet for
the alleged murder of Marian Lambert,
there has arisen a point whereat the
state desired to express skepticism or
to insinuate a "frame up" in the mat
ter of defense evidence, the name of
Harry J. Carlin has been used with
sneering emphasis.
There was unusual interest there
fore today when Carlin mounted the
witness stand.
Mr. Carlin was retained as an in
vestigator by James H. Wilkerson,
chief of Orpet's counsel and it was he,
at the head of a party who found on
Feb. J8 the bottle of molasses and
water which Orpet said he threw away
when he fled from Marian's body on
Feb. 0. When Orpet went on the
stand Attorney David Joslyn of the
prosecution, by every device of sar
casm attempted to make his incred
uality as to the bottle story plain.
Mr. Joslyn this morning indicated
his attitude toward the whole bottle
incident when he asked:
"Mr. Carlin, did the bottle look the
same as when you first saw it?"
Carlin laughed at the lawyer's ef
forts to trap him.
"I never saw it before In my life," he
replied with emphasis.
"There were no tracks leading; to
the bottle?"
"None hut mine. When I came up I
called attention of the others to the
fact."
"Oh. you galled their attention to it
Why, Mr. Carlin V ' j
"Because I knew that the bottle
would figure in the case and that
they would be called as witnesses." i
Mr. Joslyn doubled and twisted In
seeKing to betray the witness into
some damaging admission but the lat
ter met him sharply at every turn.
Robert C. Lindsay, who picked up
the bottle of molasses and water re
pcated .substantially what Cariin had
tes (Tiled. '
"Were the contents of the bottle
frozen" asked Mr. Joslyn.
"No, but when I tipped the hottls I
noticed that it was thick moved slow
ly," replied the witness.

Burlington, Iowa, July 1. Drillers
employed by wildcat speculators
struck a five-foot vein of rich oil at
a depth of 500 feet on a farm near
Biggsville, 111., 15 miles east of here
j today. This is the first oil ever strucK
in the vicinity, but geological experts
have pronounced the site a promising
field, and already a rush has been
started by speculators for leases on
adjacent land. The maiden producer
of the field is not a gusher, but is sim
ilar to the wells in the Plymouth, 111.,
field, which are producing large profits
for owners.

Messages received at the state de
