"The Inside of the White Slave
Traffic."
"The inside of the White Slave
Traffic," a graphic presentation of
conditions actually existing in Amer
ica, is announced as the Sunday at
traction at the Gem, and the offering
is certain to prove one of the most
notable of the season. The startling
realism of this great picture drives
home with terrifie force a fact about
which everyone should know, and re
veals the truth of the white slave
trafic in all its horrible phases. The
viciou life of the traficker is lived
before your eyes. Only truth is de
picted, and this needs no embellish
ment to lend sensational interest or
dramatic strength to the astounding
production. To show the life ijst as
it is lived daily by thousands it, our
own country is more than sensational
-more than dramatic. It is tragic.
Samuel H. London, the author and
producer of this picture, is the
world's greatest authority upon the
subject. His research work has taker,
him through nearly every civilized
community on the globe, and every
foet as portrayed is substantiated by
numerous authentic instances.
This picture is Mr. London's
method of placing the truth before
civilized people everywhere. To miss
it is not only to miss the revelation of
a great truth; it is to miss one of the
most interesting and exciting photo
dramas ever produced.

in America. Stephen is notified of
the contents of the strange will, at a
trading station in Africa. lie decides
he will not aceept any assistance
from his uncle, and with Timothy

way out of it. They find the body of
a white man floating in the river, and
Stephen put all his papers and trink

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference,
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
Ballots and Warriors.
Defense of country, platform heroes
have hysterically told us is an at
tribute of the vote. Now is the time
to put into practice the oft-repeated
anti-suffrage slogan, "You cannot
vote because you cannot light."
Somebody, please enforce that gem
argument called "blank cartridge bal
lot," and disfranchise the non-com
batants. By "blank cartridge ballots"
one yclept Johnson (general, we pre
sume) meant that women's ballots
would not be founded on brute force.
He forgot that some men are not par
ticularly husky, that effective govern
ment requires brain as well as muscle.
If only warriors could approach the
ballot-box what a lonely shrine it
would be! But with the Mexican dif
ficulty brewing it may prive a Maxim
silencer to many a man whi loudly
prated of woman's unfitness for the
vote because she couldn't serve her
country in time of war. Next time
you hear some non-defender advance
the "blank cartridge ballot" stuff, put
a gun in his hand and lead him gently
to the recruiting office. It's enlist,
my suffrage obstructor, or else es
Lablish your own military record.
Absent Voters' Law.
The "absent voters'" law has been
drafted and will be introduced in the
Minnesota legislature. Under it the
voter could vote by affidavit if ab
sent from his home town. He marks
and mails his ballot directed to the
precinct in which he lives. On elec
tion day it will be opened, the name
read and checked off on the poll-book,
and the folded ballot be deposited in
the ballit-box. This proposed law for
Minnesota is based on the law of the
state of Virginia. It is endorsed by
the United Commercial Travelers
Union and will be a great thing for
thousands of railway trainmen also.
Such a law would be a tremendous
impetus for the woman suffrage
cause. It would remove the objection
so often and so foolishly urged
against the presence of women at the
polls. The most timid woman could
express her preference by mail and
avoid the necessity for leaving her
home even the fifteen minutes requir
ed to tote in her circumscribed pre
cinct. Verily the antis will soon be
hard pressed for arguments against
votes for women. Not even a mili
tant anti could object to permitting a
woman fifteen minutes from home.

year the institution has been co-edu
cational. At the DeRidder High
School, all thirteen graduates were

little to vote, or are they afraid we
know too much,"
Will Either Fight or Pray.
A minister of the gospel who will
either fight or pray, in whichever ca
pacity he is most needed in time of
war, has offered his services to Major
General George Barnett, commandant
of the United States Marine Corps.
He is Rev. Ferdinand F. Schultz, pas
tor of the Church of Christ Disciples,
Chillicothe, Ohio, and is a practical
engineer as well as minister.
In offerng his services the Rev.
Schultz expressed willingness to serve
in the fire-room of a battleship, or as
chaplain of marines in the field.
The patriotic and versatile Ohio
pastor is 57 years of age, but says he
is hale and hearty and ready to re

YOUR SON AND THE GUARD.
Let Him Determine For Himself His
Course in the Present Crisis.
Does your son want to enlist in the
national guard? If ýe does, be sure
you have soxpe other, reason than a
selfish one before yo1 advise him not
to do so.
In the life of a natt i, as well as in
the life of an individual, fighting
sometimes becomes necessary. Noth
ing else will serve as well. Though
turning the other cheek a few times
may be highly commendable, it can
not be kept up indd'fitely, either by
an individual or a nation.
Until men become able to guide
the instinct of self-preservation with
perfect wisdom, they will fight, and
nations ruled by men will do the
same.
The United States is preparing to
do some necessary fighting with Mex
ico, and the national guard has been
called out to be mustered into regular
service if needed.
The national guard needs more
men, as very few of the companies
are up to war strength,
Every person who can respond to
the call for recruits Without having to
make a greater sacriflee than the ur
gency of the occupation demands,
should respond to this call.
Someone must do the fighting, and
if your son, or your friend, thinks he
should enlist in the national guard,
that he owes this duty to his country,
do not try to prevent him. Let him
decide the question for himself.--Ba

mortal years it has passed through
many scenes and unseens, and yet to
clay. regardless of what others think
or say about it, the EchQ is our joy
and pride. It has led us when we
were naked and clothed us when we
were hungry. It has been loyal to its
friends and more than considerate to
its enemies. it has often appeared
optimistic when it *as as blue as a

we can."

JARED Y. SANDERS EULOGIZED.
A Down-the-River Newspaper's Fine
Tribute to the ex-Governor.
Our esteemed contemporary, the
Lower Coast Gazette, published at
Pointe-a-la-Hache, Plaquemines par
ish, ornamented the front page of its
June 17 edition with a particularly
fine half-tone portrait of ex-Governor
Jared Y. Sanders, and accompanied
the picture with the following edi
torial tribute to the popularity, ser
vices and ability of the distinguished
aspirant for a congressional seat from
the sixth Louisiana district:
"Ex-Governor Sanders and Hon.
Amos Ponder are the competing can
didates for congress in the sixth con
gressional district, and both of these
gentlemen are now carrying on their
campaign with a good deal of activity.
As our readers generally know, the
sympathies of our own parish lie
largely with Gov. Sanders. When he
was competing for the gubernatorial
chair with our fellow citizen, Hon.
Theodor Wilkinson, the Democrats
of this parish stood practically solid
for Mr. Wilkinson, only giving Gov.
Sanders some twenty-five votes,
against some seven hundred for Mr.
Wilkinson. We felt at that time that
as Mr. Wilkinson was one of our fel
low citizens, we should give him the
precedence in casting our votes, al
though some of our political leaders
already stood pledged to Gov. San
ders and felt compelled to go and ask
to be relieved of their promises after
Mr. Wilkinson had announcec his can
didacy.
"During Gov. Sanders' administra
tion he was always willing to do what
he could for the parish of Plaque
mines, knowing exactly as he did the
'auses that led to our heavy vote for
his political opponent at that time.
"Gov Sanders is a man of rare
ability and extraordinary energy, and
one of the best stump speakers in
Louisiana, and we say in advance now
that we have no doubt he will be
elected to represent his district in
congress, he hailing from the city of
Bogalusa, where he has been residing
for some years. Gov. Sanders de
serves well of the people of his dis
trict, and, in fact, deserves well of
the people of the whole state and of
the city of New Orleans in particular.
When he had been elected United
States senator after the death of Sen
ator McEnery, he appreciated the de
sire of his fellow citizens throughbut
the state to retain him in Louisiana as
the promoter of the great contemplat
ed Panama exposition, which we then
hoped would be located in New Or
leans. This led Gov. Sanders to re
sign the seat in the United States
senate to which he was elected by the
legislature, and cast his lot with his
own people here in. his,, i apn
endeavor to secure the Panama
Pacific fair. When the opposition of
President Taft to New Orleans as the
location of the fair was developed, it
became evident that all efforts to
secure the fair for New Orleans
would be futile, and we were then led
to regret that Gov. Sanders had not
accepted his election to the United
States senate as he contemplated.
"There can be no doubt but that in
the house of representatives in Wash
ington he will become a conspicuous
figure. His excellent oratory, his
strenuosity in debate and his confi
dence in his own powers, which are
great, have made him one of the most
conspicuous features in -public life in
Louisiana, and we believe will now
combine to make him a conspicuous
national figure when he appears in the
halls of. the house of representa
tives in Washington after the 4th of
next March, as a member of the then
incoming congress. We shall hope
that, although out of our district, he
will retain in his memory the many
friends he has in Plaquemines parish,
where he has always been' a general
favorite."
NEWSPAPERS REAL PATRIOTS.
Expected to Serve Their Country
Without Recompense.
It has been suggested-and a wise
suggestion it is-that the war depart
ment advertise for recruits in the
newspapers instead of by posters. If
the Secretary of the War Department
will just step around the corner and
interview one or two of the success
ful merchants in Washington, he'll
quickly learn the virtue of the news
paper as a medium for reaching the
public. Wake up, "Uncle Sam," and
send for our advertising rates.
Florida Parishes.
Not on your life. Uncle Sam
knows a trick worth two of that. Like
the world in general, the canny old
gentleman understands the full value
of publicity in newspapers, and keeps
a squad of officials and a colossal
government printing office working
full time getting out bulletins on
every conceivable subject, which are
duly forwarded by every mail to every
newspaper in the land for republica
tion and exploitation. Frequently
this matter is accompanied by press
ing requests for publication from the
official heads of the various bureaus.
No newspaper editor of any conse
quence but receives sufficient govern
mental material each week to fill his
paper thrice over-if he used one half
of the stuff Uncle Sam sends him so
diligently.
But paying for it is a viewpoint un
known to Uncle Sam. He pays all
the other workers, good salaries and
easy hours, but when it comes to pay
ing the newspapers ! With re
gard to this very matter of recruits
it has not been a month since the
newspapers were requested to dilate,
pro bono publico, upon the new pro
vision making certain men eligible
for West Point, but there was not the
slightest hint of pay for the service.
Verily, newspapers are expected to
be the only real patriots: to serve
their country without money, without
price, and most times, without appre
ciation.-St. Francisville True-Dem
