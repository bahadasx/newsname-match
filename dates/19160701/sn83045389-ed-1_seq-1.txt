The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway
has been without a general manager'
( since the office was vacated several
: years ago, when George P. Johnson, a
son of President l?. R. Johnson, of thej
I N'orfolk and Western. resigned to
I accept an executive position with one
of the Norfolk and Western's branch
lines. Since that time the duties of the:
olllce have fallen on President Stevens,:
; who was assisted by General Superin
tendent of Transportation Grice. It]
was during this period that rumors
j wore circulated at intervals that Paul
Stevens was slated to become general
manager of the road.
Young Mr. Stevens is thirty-one years j
old, and while he is one of the young- j
est men in the country holding a posi-j
; tion of such importance, he is said to
I be more than competent to take charge
i of the road. He i* regarded by rail

country and one of the best in the

FIRST-CLASS CITY
Mayor and Council Named by
Governor Take Office
To-Day.
HARRISON IS WITH MILITIA
President of Board of Aldermen
Must Serve as Acting Mayor
During His Absence.
Hopewell's Board of Aldermen, which
comes Into official existence to-day
under the recent act of the Legislature,
will ltsr-lf decide who Is to be acting
Mayor of the guneotton city in the|
absence r,f Mayor Benjamin Harrison.)
The latter was appointed to this offiro
I by Governor Stuart for a term which
begins to-day and expires on Septem
ber 1. 1020. As major, commanding the
First Battalion of the Second Virginia
, Infantry, already called to the colors,
lie will not b?? able to serve.
Confronted by this situation. Gover
nor Stuart applied this week to Attor
ney I.iavid A. Harrison, Jr., of Hopewell,
for his const ruction of the law govern-1
intc the filling of vacancy in the Mayor's
office. Mr. Harrison, as member of the
Hou?" from Prince Genrco County at
the last session, was patron of the bill
which created Hopewell's government,
i Mr. Harrison replied yesterday with
an opinion, in which h? holds that the
1 temporary absence of Mayor Harrison
must be ca^ed for under th^ general
law which provide? for the assumption
of the Mayor's duties by th<* president
of the Board of Aldermen. In this view
Attorney.General Pollard concurred.
I'Memdext ok amiermEx
MI ST SEHVE AS JIAVtin
The calling into service of Major
i Harrison had produced a "lively politi
cal situation in Hopewell. Candidates
palore were proposed for the "vacancy,"
and gossip busied itself with figuring
j out the manner of selecting a successor.
(In some quarters it was believed that
' th? Governor would have to make
another appointment. Others favored
J an election. >
| Under the decision ? now re-ached.
i Major Harrison will qualify. and the
[president of Hopewell's Board of Alder
! men will become acting Mayor of Hope
: well and discharge the duties of that
| office until Mayor Harrison returns.
The three members of the Board arc;
I M. A. Finn, appointed for a term which
expires September 1. 1920, and Richard
! Eppes and H. ,T. Watkins, whose terms
I expire on September 1, 191S. The fan
that Mr. Finn is the long-term member
[gives support to the assumption that
i?e will be elected president of the
Board, and will, therefore, become
acting Mayor of Hopewell. The Board
| itself, however, will elect, and there is
! nothing- in the law to bind them to the
I selection of the long-term member.
: IIA It It ISO.Y COXSTUUES
i.aw ox srnjECT
? In his letter to Governor Stuart. At
! torney David A. Harrison, Jr., states
: the law on the mayoralty question as
I follows:
I "The general law as to who shall act
i in the absence of the Mayor of a city
| is as follows:
"Section 1033 of the Virginia Code:
['In the event of the death, resignation,
removal of the Mayor, or his inability
to discharge his duties from some other
'cause, his place shall be filled and his
i duties shall be discharged by the presi
dent of the Board of Aldermen or by
| the president of the Council, accord
i ing- as the City Council has or has not
j two nches, until another Mayor is
| elect and qualified, or until such lia
Ibtlity mil cease.'
"The charter incorporating the city
of Hopewell in reference to lite same
matter roads as follows:
! " 'Provided, that if the removal or a
[change of residence of the Mayor or of
i any member of either branch of the
[Council shall create a vacancy in such
I position and m the event of a vacancy
occurring by reason of death, removal
, or otherwise in the ollice of the Mayor
before the first day of September, 1020,
such vacancy shall be filled for the un
expired term by tlie Governor.'
"But, since the temporary absence of
| Major Harrison Is neither a removal
from office nor a change of residence
I nor a resignation, the charter is not
applicable. This, then, means that the
general law controls. And, under the
general law as above set out, the
[Mayor's place is filled and his duties
; discharged by the president of the
Board of Aldermen until another Mayor
is elected and qualified, or until his
liability to discharge his duties shal
cen sc."

WASHINGTON. June 30.?An agree
ment under which Congress is ex
pected to authorize a Federal bond
issue to meet the extraordinary ex
penses of the Mexican emergency
was reached to-day by administration
loaders Under the plan, such an
I issue actually would he made only in
j rane the ordinary resources of the

I ooo expected from the administration

The whole revenue, situation has been
gone over minutely in a seites of con
ferences between Secretary McAdoo.
Chairman Simmons, of the Senate
Finance Committee, and Chairman
Kitchin, of the Ways and Means Com
mittee. Mr. McAdoo is understood to
have presented President Wilson's
view that the extraordinary expenses
of the Mexican crisis should not. be
met out of current tevenues, and the
committee chairmen agreed that a
bond issue might be advisable. An
other result of the conference was a
decision to put the new revenue bill
through immediately. It probably will
be passed by the House next week.

The exact amount of the Treasury
surplus for the fiscal year will not be
known until to-morrow, but at the
close of business yesterday it was
$174.171.S45, and officials believed to
day's receipts would increase it to
more than $200,000,000. Total income
tax receipts was expected to amount to
more than $115,000,000. The total ordi
nary receipts for the year, including
June 20. were $712,fi54.574.
Senator Simmons and Representative
Kitchin emphasized to-night that they
were in hearty accord with the Treas
ury's proposal to segregate the ex
penses of the Mexican situation from
the ordinary government expenditures.
Mr. Kitchin said that the appropria
tions in the supply hills and the esti
mates submitted to Congress on ac
count of the expenses fit" mobilization
and other conditions at the border in
Mexico approximate 1125,000,000.
"These and all necessary appropria

we have war or not, should be met by
