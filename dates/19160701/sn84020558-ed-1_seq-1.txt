republican A. P. Leased Wire
NF.W YUltK, June 30. President
Wilson made it plain in his speech ut
the New York Press club banquet to
night that he will not countenance a
war with .Mexico unless there is no
other alternative for settling the border
troubles.
AKti he declared that he was ready
to sacrifice his own political future in
order to carry out his convictions as
to what would be the just course to
pursue in the situation.
The president's audience, composed of
UrTvpaper men, state and municipal
political leaders, and other prominent
in public life, signified their endorse
ment of his position by repeated out
bursts of applause. When he asked if
the glory of America would be en
hanced by a war of conquest with
.Mexico, cries of "no" came from all
pans of the bampiet hall. A similar re
sponse was made to his query wheth
er "America's duty to carry self de
fense to the point of dictation Into
the affairs of another people."
The president dwelt also on his ef
forts to serve the whole people thou
sands of whom, he said, are appealing
to him to maintain peace as long as
p issible.
"I have constantly to remind myself,"
he said, "that I am not the servant of
those who wish to enhance the value
of their Mexican investments but that
I am the servant of the rank and file of
the people of the United States."
Bainbridge Colby, who placed Theo
dore Koosevelt in nomination for the
presidency at the progressive conven
tion at Chicago, paid rresident Wilson
high tribute but did not declare un
qualifiedly that he would support him
in the coming campaign as it was re
ported he would do.
President Wilson arose in his seat
and shook hands with Mr. Colby as he
finished speaking. Mayor John P.
Mitchel, Ralph Pulitzer, and Irvin S.
Cobb, also spoke. The presidential
party that included Mrs. Wilson, occu
pied seats in the balcony. President
Wilson did not begin to speak until al
most 11 o'clock.
In his address President Wilson said:
"I realize that I have done a very
imprudent tiling. I have come to ad
dress this thoughtful company of men
without any preparations whatever. If
1 could have written as witty a speech
as Mr. Pulitzer, 1 would have written it.
If I could have written as clear an
enunciation of the freedom issues of
American patriotism as the mayor, I
should have attempted it. If I could
have been as appealing a person and
of as feeling a heart as Mr. Cobb, I
would have felt safe. If I could have
been as genereous and interesting and
genuine as Mr. Colby, I should hava

OAKLAND, Cal., June 30. An
explosion in the smoking car of
Southern Pacific train No. 5 on its
arrival here tonight from Ogden,
Utah, blew a big hole in the steel
roof and caused injuries to eight
passengers.
F. T. Marquis of San Francisco,
who was in the car said there was
a distinct odor of burned gun

shock was very violent, and a
sheet of the steel roofing of the car
was blown high in the air and fell
more than a hundred feet from
where the train was standing.
All the injured were Californians.

WAR FRONTS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Successes for the entente allies on
the three most important European
fronts in France, in the Italian theater
and in East Oalicia are chronicled in
the latest communications. The French
and the British continue their offen
sives and have captured the Thiennont
works northeast of Verdun and the
British having kept up their bombard
meats of German
trenches and their !
incursions into German positions by
raiding parties. The Russians have
taken Kolomea, and important railway
junctions leading to Lemberg, in Oa
licia, and the Italians continue to ad
vance against the Austrians in the
Trentino region. 'ij
The struggle for the possession of the
Thieurmoiit works, taken by the Ger
man crown prince's, forces from the
French a week ago was most severe,
the position changing hands several
times.
Violent bombardments have marked
the fighting on the remainder of the
front around Verdun, particularly on
the sector of Hill 304.
The British are keeping up their tac
tics of destroying by artillery fire, the
Germans' first and second line trenches
from Y'pres to the Somme.
On the front in Russia, from the
Galician border to the region of Riga,
there have been battles at various
points but with no decisive results.
The Italians have taken Griso, and
several mountain positions southeast
of Trent. Their advance against the
Austrians also has resulted in the cap
ture of nearly a thousand prisoners as
well as stores of arms and munitions.
Vienna claims only the repulse of at
tacks in this sector.
An unofficial report of a battle be
tween Russian and German squadrons
in the Baltic sea south of Stockholm
on Thursday .has been received in
London.

MEXICO CITY, June 30. The for
eign office today issued a memoran
dum in reply to Secretary Lansing's re
cent note in which the correctness of
assertions in the communication from
Washington were repeatedly denied.
The memorandum declares that the
United States had no right to maintain
its armed forces on Mexican soil.
The memorandum contains thirty
five counts. Although not in the form
of a direct reply to the Washington
note, it is considered equivalent to an
answer to that document.
It expresses surprise that the Wash
ington government should have been
pained at the tone and the contents of
the Carrun.a document, since it main
tains that the United States has sent
to the constitutional government not
only one but many discourteous and
even threatening notes.
Emphatically reiterating the Mexican
government's position denying the right
of the United States to keep armed
bodies in Mexico, the memorandum de
nies energetically that the Mexican,
government had protected bandits who
had committed depredations in (he
I'nited States, and defies Washington
to produce proof of the assertion.
Blame for the Santa Y'saliel massacre
is placed on the socially impulsive and
irascible disposition of Charles Wat
son, general manager of the Cusihui
rachic company; and General Scott and
General Funston are accused of bad
faith and lack of honor in misleading
General Obregon in an elleged evasive
reply regarding the crossing of Ameri
can troops into Mexico after the Glenn
Springs raid.
The memorandum asserts that while
it is true that the United States arrest
ed General Huerta, the motive which
prompted this act was not the purpose
of aiding the constitutionalist govern
ment, but because the United States
feared that General Huerta was plot
ting with Germany.
The note concludes by declaring that
the presence of American troops in
Mexico invites rather than prevents
bandit raids along the border.
The memorandum was issued at the
same time that the foreign office au-

th-1 advertisement had been prepared
under the direction of President Jul
ius Pier:iiter. He was not at the of
fice and in h's absence, none of the
officials would discuss the submarine.
Secrecy, it was said, was necessary
to prevent a possible conflict with the
American "government on the status of
the boat a question of neutrality only,
it was explained. According to this:
versiin, the German embassy feared
that the submarine might be regarded
as a warship by the United States au
thorities, and, as such, order it out
of American waters within 24 hours.

the border war scare bubble which in
the last twenty-four hours had shown
signs of bursting.
Military officials everywhere doubled
their vigilance and the fear grew
that when the text of the memoran-
num reached the south side of the
border more clashes might result in
which the civilian population would
suffer.
The arrival of detachments of the
national guard, expected here by to
morrow, was expected to bring a feel
ing of security.
The guard will be spread out as
soon as possible, in points w here the
border is not now well protected.
Twenty-two horses, twenty-one sad
dles and a quantity of rifles, pistols,
ammunition and clothing, captured at
Carrizal, today was turned over at

INFORMATION IS

STILL DEFIANT
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, June 30. Whila
administration officials manifested
impatience today over the delay of
the Carranza government in replying
to the American demand for an ex
planation of its purposes, private ad
vices from Mexico City indicated that .
a defiant answer was being prepared
there.
The state department has had no
direct information as to when the
Mexican response would be sent, or
how it would be transmitted. Secre
tary Lansing called this fact to the
attention of Elisea Arredondo, Mexi
can ambassador-designate, during the
day, and indicated that he did not
understand the delay in view of tho
statement in the morning note of last
Sunday that an early answer was ex
pected, Mr. Arredondo, who had called
to announce formally the release of
the Carrizal prisoners said he had
not heard from his government on
the subject.
Although Special Agent Rodgers at
Mexico City was informed two days
ago that he might expect to be hand
ed the Mexicon note that day, he
has made no mention of it in later
dispatches. Some officials believed it
possible the communication would
come through Mr. Arredondo and that
its actual delivery would be condi
tioned on the situation at the time
he received it. Efforts at arranging
mediation, favored by Carranza of
ficials, led to the belief that the re
ply would be withheld at the last
moment, if there seemed any chance
thit the AVasbington government
would listen to such proposals.
The private messages sent by per
sons in a position to speak with some
authority as to General Carranza's
attitude, expressed the conviction tl.at
a break between the two governments
was unavoidable.
There appeared to be complete
agreement among members of the
Mexican cabinet, that orders to Gen
eral Trevino to attack American
troops moving in any direction ex
cept toward the border, be re-affirmed.
Some of the de lacto otnciais
wished to go further and couple with
this statement jn the Mexican reply
a defiant demand that American
troops be withdrawn immediately
from Mexican soil.
The unconciliatory character of a
memorandum published in Mexico City
specifically denying all the allegations
of the previous American note in
answer to Carranza's demand for
withdrawal of the troops, appear to
bear out this forecast. Intimations
have reached officials here, however,
that the de facto government may
give strong assurances m its note
that border raids will be iirevented by
a strong patrol of Mexican troops, if
the United States will withdraw its
forces. It was taid at the Mexican,
embassy tonight that 00,000 Carranza
troops are now available for border ,
patrol duty.
Another communication was sent to
the state department today by Mr.
Arredont1!), protesting against the
shooting of a Mexican customs in
spector by American soldiers stationed

Consul Garcia at Kl Paso. Accord

It also was stated that General Calles

several Mexicans arrested here and at

attempting to Incite their countrymen.

border district.
General Calles placed a patrol of
Mexican soldiers tonight along the bor

line.
