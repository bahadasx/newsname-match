BRAZIL BUTTS IN AtfAIN
But Lansing Makes' It Clear
That There is Nothing
to Mediate.
Washington, D. C, June 30. The
Washington government still awaited
further compliance with" its demands
by the dc facto authorities of Mexico.
Release Gen, Garrnza's order of
the American prisoners taken at Car
rizal has averted the probability of
immediate retaliatory steps. It is pos
sible that it has also helped to pave
the way toward an attempt at peaceful
settlement of the whole border situa
tion. High officials made it very
clear however, that the vital point at
issue the future attitude of Mexican
forces toward American forces in
northern Mexico engaged in guarding
the border and pursuing bandits who
raided American territory remains
to be settled.,
Intimations have come, it is under
stood, that Carranza intends to back
up the order issued to Gen. Trevino
directing that .American troops be at
tacked if they move in any direction
in Mexico, excep.toward the border.
Officials are fully prepared for a reply
of that character.-despite-the fact "that
the prisoners taken atJ Crirrizal have
been promptly surrendered on de
mand. Mr Lansing made it clear today to
Ignacio Calderon, minister from Bo
livia, that pending a formal reply from
the Carranza government to his late
note, no offer of mediation would be
acceptable to the. United States.
Final decision by Washington offi
cials as to the responsibility for the
fighting cannot be reached until a
complete report from Gen. Pershing
is available. He is gathering from
survivors all information they have as
to what happened and will submit a
full report to Secretary Baker, who
will in turn transmit it to the state de
partment for consideration.

SHORTAGE
OF MEN
Recruits Still Wanted And
Some May Start -Monday.
Fort Thomas, Ky June 30. "It is
the lack of recruits more than any
thing else that is holding us back.
What we want is men, more men, and
more men, and when we get enough
men, we will begin to make our ap
pearance on the border." This was
the statement mado by Brig. Gen.
Roger Williams when asked why Ken
tucky state guards. were still in mobil
ization camp wheltymilitiamen from
other states were being rushed to the
border. New orders received from
Frankfort were interpreted as indicat
ing that as soon as the Kentucky con
tingent had been inoculated and ex
amined they would in all probability
leave for the border not later than
Monday.
Delay Advantageous.
Any delay incident to new negotia
tions with Gen. Carranza ill be of
inestimable benefit to the United
States should tho course of events
cause a clash between the United
States and the defacto government,
according to army officers. The ad
vantage would consist not only of per
