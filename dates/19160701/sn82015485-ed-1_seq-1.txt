From tha Wi-KutT Boy
K. N.-G. Co. M.,lst Kansas Regiment
(Encamped)
Ft. Riley, Kan., June 27, 1916.
Western Kansas World,
Wa-Keeney, Kansas,
Dear Sir: ;
No doubt there are some who would
like to hear from the Wa-Keeney boys
who enlisted for service in the K. U.
Company officially degignated as
Company M, First Regiment, Kansas
National GuaTds.
Soon after our arrival in Lawrence
we were shown to the recuiting office
and immediately examined for enlist
ment. " It will be interesting for a
few of our f rierlds out there to learn
that we passed this examination eas
ily even above the average.
We entrained at once (Friday morn
ing) and started for Riley leaving in
Lawrence a large crowd of enthusias
tic but dejected looking people who
had assembled on the grounds to see
the boys off. All along the line peo
ple seemed to realize that wo were
not on a picnic excursion, but that &
crisis was at haal which demanded
men who would "do or die" for their
country. We will frankly admit that
we would rather "do", than "die."
There are at present two Kansas reg
iments encamped here and three bat
teries consisting of machine gun, sig
nal and ar tilery corps. To one not
experienced In camp life this is a de
cidedly novel experience. We have
learned mo.e about militaryism in
the last few days than we ever ex
pected to know. Our program each
day has consisted of reveille at 5 a.
m. giving us ten minutes to dress be
fore assembly for roll call, theiv we
fix tent and get ready- for mess; mess
call finds us all in line with our kits
in hand ready for beans, sow bosom
and coffee. Immediately after eats
we fall in line for fatigue duty
which means in pure U. S. language
to clean our company street of refuse.
Next comes call to arms for drill
which lasts four hours evefy hour
a ten minutes rest. Then beans
again and we are off duty for the rest
ot the day until 6 o'clock at which
tima we have retreat, then beans
and we are excused for the night ex
Kansas.

cept when detailed for some special
duty such as guard, etc.
The bunch in our company is con
sisted of K. U. students and we enjoy
one continual round of pleasure giv
ing yells and songs such yells as
"Rock Chalk" and several composi
tions which we composed o-irselves
our famous infantry song:
The infantry, the infantry
With dust behind their ears,
The infantry, the infantry
That laps up all the bears,
The cavalry, artillery, and
All the engineers couldn't whip
This bunch of infantry
In a hundred thousand years.
The latest reports from the captain
is that we leave for the border the
middle or this week. -We were mus
tered into federal service today and
we all hope that this signifies
speedy departure.
Our mascot is a white spitz dog
that we promoted at Topeka as we
came through, bis name is Jay Hawk
and on the whole is some pup.
We have in camp a bath house and
other conveniences which detract
front the usual stringency of military
life.
As we left Wa-Keeney in a harry
we missed telling a few good bye.
We will be pleased to hear front our
friends, so consider this an invitation
to write.
"Bill" Lucas, formerly of Wa-Kee
ney, is with this regiment in compa
ny A, his mother visited us in camp
yesterday, also Forrest Forrester, his
wife and little daughter, Virginia,
and Jean Forrester also paid us a
visit and took some snap shots of the
Wa-Keeney squad in khaki.
Yesterday being Sunday several
thousand people visited camp and we
met many whom we knew.
We will soon be on our way to
Mexico. So good bye.

MARKET REPORT .
Kansas City Stock Yards, June 26.
1916. The course in cattle- prices
most of the week was downward.
Receipts were liberal, quality showed
a plainer case and killers increased
the spread in' prices accordingly.
Prime grades held steady, and short
fed and grass fat steers were off 25
to 35 cents. ' This decline caused a

as a year agtk. Most of the grass fat

This Ls the .slack season for stock and

last greek's bog prices declined mod
erately, and today turned up again

highest point last week. The top

the jhogs sold at S9.65 to 99.90. Con

, C W. Miller for State Sana tar
We are glad to see . Mr. Miller of
Hays get into the road for State Sen
ator. While we were not personally
acquainted with Mr. Miller, we heard
him well spoken of everywhere and
that he bears a splendid reputation,
has a clean record and is a real Re
publican. He ls in the class of men
that do things all over the district,
and we believe that he will be a suc
cesful candidate in 1916. We had the
pleasure of meeting Mr. Miller - at
Hays, last week, and we find he
stands high among his own people
which is a good sign that he is a wide
awake citizen and one of whom Ellis
county feels proud. .The . Republi
cans will make no mistake in nomin
ating him. He is absolutely quali
fied and has the ear marks of honor
and reliability. We -feel that when
be goes to the State Senate, we could
go to Topeka and put our feet on his
desk. No frills but a plain ordinary
honest man to whom any farmer or
business man can tie with pleasure.
Beaver Valley Booster, Decatur
County.
r Cn the LSth day of May 11, C W.
Miller filed his nomination papers
and will have virtually mo -opposition
for the Republican Nomination for
Senator in the 39th district. Mr.
Miller has been- a resident of Ellis
County for over thirty years and is
thoroughly' in touch with all the
wants and needs of western Kansas.
Being an owner of farms, make his
interests, identical with those of the'
farmers of the 39th district. In the
past thirty years ' he has seen the
prairies of western Kansas, improved,
bought and paid for by the blood or
the bravest men, and the purest and
and noblest women that the world
ever knew. The Free Press hopes
that the Republicans will give Mr.
Miller their hearty support. His re
cord as a Republican is above ques
tion. He at once becomes a formid
able candidate and has shown that he
has the backing to make him the
strongest man in the district for
State Senator. His long service in
the Republican party entitles him to
its individual support. Mr. Miller
JEWELER

stands for the great issues of the day,
Woman Suffrage, Preparedness and ,
the highest ideals of American Cit
izenship. We hope that the Republicans, of
