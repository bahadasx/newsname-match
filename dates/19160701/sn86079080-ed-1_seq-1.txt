Bill To Create New Ward In St.
John Starts Red Hot Political
Fight In The House.
Ml Solud Pass sas Mr. RN, of
Orleans, Because It Is In The Interest
of The Democrats.
Appearance of another "excit
ing" bill, the third of the session
precipitated a red hot political
scrap on the floor of the house
during Thursday night's session.
Senator Rivarde's bill to create
two wards out of Ward Three of
S't. John parish was the main
issue:
The new member of the police
Jury is to be appointed by the
Governor, which will undoubted
ly give the faction having the
governor's ear control of the
police jury. The governor is also
to appoint constables, Justices of
the Peace, and member of the
School Board from the ward.
The bill came before the House
without action from the Paro
chial affairs Committee. It was
reported that way because the
rcommittee was divided. Repres
estative Nix of Orleans, moved
its advancement to third reading
'.The bill should pass because
it is in t interest of the Demo
crate". Mr. Nix said. "In the
Senate the . adlratration was
behind it.

Soldiers May Take Out
Life Insurance
Companies Anxious to Get Business;
Small Advance In Premiums.
Life insurance policies are as
effective and protective in war as
in peace. Any soldier who had his
life insured any day before he re
sponded to the call is not required
to pay any extra premium because
he may be going on the firing
line. If he had not taken out any
insurance, but is anxious to do so
he will nit be refused because he
is bound for war. He will, how
ever, be charged a special and
additional rate. Each company
will take $2000 risk on a warrior,
and in addition to the regular
premium he will have to pay $30
on each thousand dollars, though
only for the first year. A few of
the companies are charging $50
extra per thousand. If he does not
pay the. special assessment, his
beneficiaries will not receive over
$200 each on each $1000 of insur
ance. The extra, money is a sort
of reserve fund in case of any
especially heavy mortality. In
case the money is not needed,
insurance mpn are of the opinion
that it will be refunded.
Evidently the insurance com
panies are of theopinion that even
if the is a war with Mexteco the
hazetd will be much less than on
the soldiers on the battlefields of
Europe. The insured over there
are compelled to .pay$100 extir

Dupre Warns Men
Who would Enlist
Should .ave Eyes Open To What U. S.
Expects.
"'Men who enlist in the national
:guard new should do so with their
eyes open," said Representative
Garland Dupre of New Orleans.
' they should do so with the ful'
knowledge of what they are~doing
and what the United States ex
pects of them."
Representative Dupre had re
ference to the fact that the United
States, in taking over the nation
al guard for federal service, is
going to extend excuses for ser
vice with a very meager hand and
scarcely any one will be excused
from service in case the disputed
provision in the Hay resolution is
adopted, allowing a $50 a moath
provision for dependent families.
The administration of the fund
will be strict and an extremely
rigid interpretation of the phrase
'dependent family" will be made
In case the senate provision to
excuse heads of dependent famil
lies f.".duty is adopted, the
sarpe idity will be observed.

WHAT THE EDITOR f
SAYS. =
Gautier Sits as Police Jury
and Board of Reviewers.
Last Wednesday there assem
bled at the Courthouse in mar
velous session the most unique
"police jury" ever seen in this
or any other parish. There were
present (corporally) at the meet
ing the honorable members from
the fourth and fifth wards and
even the member-elect from the
sixth ward who sat in open de
fiance of a pending intrusion into
office and injunction suit. We
never once imagined that the
Hart faction leaders would, at
their debut, sink to such a low
level [knowing as we do that
they have always been ardent
advocates of purity in govern
ment and politics] and sanction
this course of anarchy. Their
attitude, as we translate it from
this late and famous 'coup d'etat I
seems to be an utter disregard
of the decrees and orders of our
judicial dpartment of govern
ment. That the injunction Is still I
pending against Mr. Babin re
straining him from exercising
the duties of his office admits of
no doubt as the decree of the dis
trict court has been appealed
from suspensively. Clearly, Mr.
Babin violated this injunction b3
taking part in the Wednesday
proceedings and he should bE'
dealt with accordingly. If rho
law-abiding people of this parish I
sanction these revolutionary
methods then it would be better
for us to forever abolish our de
p..rtments of gwvernment anc
revert to the customs of the bar.
barous age.
That all.e Wednesday pro
"eedmngs of the Gautier Po!ice
Jury are absolute nullities i-
evident even to the non-legal
mind. Furthermore, by some le
gal 'tour de force' three members
were declared to be a majority
out of six police jury office. The
nature of the reports received
convince us that the meeting
