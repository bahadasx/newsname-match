Learn To Laugh.
A good laugh is better than me
dicine. Learn how to tell a story.
A well-told story is as a sunbeam
in a sick-room. Learn to keep
your troubles to yourself. The
world is too busy to care for your
ills and sorrows. Learn to stop
croaking. If you cannot see any
good in the world keep the bad to
yourself. Learn to hide your
pains and aches under a pleasant
smile. No one cares whether you
have the headache, backache or
rheumatism. Don't cry. Tears do
well enough in novels but are out
of place in real life. Learn to
meet your friends with a smile.
The good humored man or woman
is always welcome.-Sovereign Vi
sitors.

FIG PRESERVES.
Six quarts figs, 4 quarts water,
and 2 pounds sugar.
Scald figs with a soda solution
using one cup soda to six quarts
water. Allow figs to remain in
water about fifteen minutes until
the white milky fluid is extracted,
which causes the water to turn
very dark. Dip out the figs and
drop in cold bath, drain. Make a
syrup of the sugar and water, al
lowing it to cook about fifteen
minutes and skim. Add figs after
thoroughly draining them, to this
syrup and cook until tender and
transparent. Lift *gs out, pack
into jars and pour syrup over them.
Process small jars 15 minutes. If
the syrup is not heavy enough, it
can be cooked down to the proper
consistency after the figs have been
lifted out, before pouring it over
final pack. Canned figs are cook
ed in just this way, but are packed
in thin syrup without cooking it
down.
