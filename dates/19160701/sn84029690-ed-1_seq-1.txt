The Court yard lawn has been irn-
weeds.
There is no reason why our court
yard lawn should not be the most beau
tiful ia the city. Wd have some very
beautiful ones where the people do the
work themselves and pay for the wa
ter to make the grass grow. It is
hoped that some good work may be
I-done this fall. The ground should be
made smooth and level and the trees
thinned out, the black locust which are
fast dying out should be replaced by
evergreens or some other more attrac
tive tree. It could be a very attractive
park and add much to the looks of our
city.
There i3 nothing prettier as an ex
terior decoration than the vines which
are growing so nicely everywhere
about the city. They make a very
rapid growth and are grown from a slip.

For 5000 years men saved the wheat
crops with the old hand-sickle. Every
bushel of wheat required three hours of
a man's life to produce it. The cradle
came and took the sickle's place, last
ing about seventy-five years, to lighten
the burdens cf the grain growers. In
the year 1809 that famous year in the
world's history, Cyrus H. McCormick
was bcm the year Lincoln and Darwin
were born two other liberators of the
race. He gave to the world the self
binding harvester. It reduced the time
to produce a bushel of wheat to ten
minutes. Men thought for years the
last thought had been given. It had
revolutionized small grain farming, and
made the United States the granary of
ar.d

There is but one advantage in the
narrow streets that the unwise found
er. ers oi our city nave leic us, tnat we
mignt iorever cisnonor tneir memory,
that is street paving will not cost so
much yet what would we not give to
add some width t ofir streets.
. Is there a law in our state to pro
tect the song birds? If there is, it
should be enforced. If there is not
some legislation should be made to pro
hibit this malitious practice. Boys
have been seen heartlessly killing song
birds within cur city limits. Could
there be anything more vicious thought
of.
We are hearty in sympathy with the
suggestions of cur JLhstrict Judge in
his letter concerning our jails. It is
hoped that the timeis not far distant
when some plan may be thought out,
whereby able bodied men who are sent
to jail might be employed in the open
air instead of maintained in idleness' in
a stuffy room where they spend the en
tire twenty-four hours of the day.
There can be no improvement expected
either mentally or physically by this
method.
We are strongly in favor of the street
paving movement. The frequent rains
have done tl:e wc.-.X of the street sprink
ler but it has sinched the opinion that
paving was an absolute necessity.
Property owners along Chestnut Street
were eager to sign up for the good

The United States Census Statistics
CONTAINS SOME INTERESTING FIGURES
These figures show that sixty-sir, read it, (66) out
of 100 people dying in the United States have ab
solutely no estate. They die penniless.
Of the remaining thirty-four (34) persons, twenty-five
die with less than $1300, and only nine (9)
persons in one hundred (100) have more than $5000
when they die.
The above figures are not estimates, idle guesses
or fiction, they are the facts, arrived at by the U.
S. Government in its Census reports.
The remedy is simple. Just save your money.
We will be glad to have you open an account

suggest that the Republican County

A Good Show.
The play "What happened to the

Presbyterian Ladies Aid Society on last

a play and financially.
The work of Miss Olive Kackley of

produce a play in one week. The cast

Otis L. Benton who was here several
days last weea, met the maiontv o
for the last 10,000 years? had been to
get bread. Famine was always stall
ing near the people in those days.
Only kings and their retinues 'had
enough bread to eat. It is no exagger
ation to say that the world was hungry
for countless centuries. Black bread
was food for the common man. Even
the nations that gave to the world
Galileo, Laplace and Newton were al
ways seeing the ghosts of hunger until
McCormick came. We had thought
that this man had ushered in the Millen
ium of Prosperity. He had. He will
live among the immortals of history.
But the last word was not said nor
the last basic notion had not been
thought by McCormick, as most men
had supposed. About eight years ago
a Kansas boy drejaraed that he could
construct a machine that would thresh
the grain while standing, leaving the
straw on the ground, eliminating the
header barge, the threshing machine
crew and all the burdens that needs
must fall upon the farmer's wife and
daughters. Un last W ednesday we
witnessed the dream of eight years ago
in action. We saw the standing grain
thresher at work. We saw the call of
the farmers answered. We saw the
work of McCormick out distanced, and
what had revolutionized harvesting of
the last half of the nineteenth century
and perfected in the first of the twen
tieth century take its place along side
of the sickle, cradle, Marsh harvester,
and Osborne wire binder I mean the
McCormick twine binders and headers.
While we will not forget the benefac
tors of the past, but let us not cling to
the traditions of ancient days, but take
hold of this "new thought" that orig
inated in Kansas, press the opportunity
and gladly recognize the new inventor,
Curtis C. Baldwin of Nickerson.
We went to the Experimental Station,
the largest one of its kind in the world,
to watch this machine make its show
ing. It was started in a field of tough,
half ripe rye, much of it still in tne
dough. Four mules were hitched to the
machine, the gasoline engine was
started, the wheels obeyed the applied
power, the cjTlinder speeded up to
about S0C revolutions and the thresher
was pushed into the grain ypassing
across one end of the field, and at least
three hundred men watched it work
After reaching the south side of the
plot the machine stopped, men gather
ed around, making comments as to the
results, but one and all agreed it "would
work." The machine may not be per
feet in its construction, but it does per
fect work.
We are free to say it is the most f;
reaching, revolutionary piece ot ma
chinery that has been given to the agri
cultural world in the last eighty years
Perhaps it will add more to the happi
ness of man, conserve the soil better
and make it possible for more people
throughout the world to eat white bread
than any invention that has been given
to man during the long roll of time. A
