AMERICANS EVACUATE
FOUR MEXICAN TOWNS
GENERAL PERSHING REMOVES ARMY NORTHWARD AS MEXICANS
DELIVER AMERICAN PRISONERS
TAKEN AT CARRIZAL
An immediate clash with Mexico
has been averted, although the war
cloud is still hovering on tthe
United States-Mexican border.
General Pershing, commanding
American forces in Mexico, has re
moved his men northward, evacu
ating four Mexican towns.
General Funston, commander-in
chief of the Mexican expedition,
has been notified that the twenty
three Americans taken prisoners
during the battle on the San Do
mingo ranch, near Carrizal, be
tween forces of the defacto govern
ment and the tenth United States
cavalry, have been released to the
United States.
President Wilson in his note to
the first chief of Mexico had .warn
ed Mexico that unless these pris
oners were immediately released
war would be declared. . It was
feared that Carranza would not
comply, with the American wishes,
and on that account preparation
for an immediate clash was made.
Although a state of 'war does not
WORK ON PARISH FAIR
GROUNDS TO START SOON
.New Sheds and Other Improve
ments to Be Made for Fair to
Be Staged Here in October
Dr. R. M. Littell, president of the
St. Landiry Farmers' Fair Associa
tion, is busy planning for the. erec
tion of additional sheds at the fair
grounds; he anticipaates making
other necessary improvements to
take care of the large exhibits to
be brought to the October. fair.
Dr. Littell who proved beyond a
doubt his ability to conduct a sup
cessful fair enjoys the co-operation
of the farmers of St. Landry wlho
tion of a fair association on a finan
cial basis; the popular head of the
fair associatiop is also being backed
to a large extent by the business
people of this city.
It is the plan of the promoters of
the fair to make' October's agricul
tural show the best thing of its kind
ever staged by .a single parish in
Louisiana. Farmers, cattle and hog
raisers throughout the parish have
signified their intention to bring
the best "on the farm" to Opelou
sas on October 5, 6, 7, and 8.
The live stock department will
be so strongly represented that the
matter of providing enough shelter
is to be some problem with Dr.
Littell, but an attempt will be made
to have enough erected to take
care of all who come.
Dr. Littell will arrange an auc
tion day, which will no doubt prove
very popular, in which event it is
the hope of the promoters of the
,parish fair to have an annual auc
tion day at each parish fair.
The fair catalogs have been
printed and many have been dis
tributed but Dr. Littell' urges all
those who have not received any
to communicate with him and one
will be forthcoming immediately.
JOHN BROWN ADMITTED
TO UNITED STATES ARMY
Ppelousas Youth Successfully
Passes Physical Examination
at New Orleans Tuesday
John Brown, one of the rural
carriers of this city, and one of the
most popular boys of this vicinity,
will depart in the early part of
July for New York to enter the
West Point Academy. Mr. Brown
stood the physical examination to
enter the army school, and already
being mentally qualified, all he has
to do is to report atthe Academy on
July 10th.
Mr. Brown went to Ncw Orleans
on last Monday, where he success
fully stood the crucial examination,
which Uncle Sam demands of all
its soldiers. He was appointed to
West Point by Senator Joseqpr E.
Ransdell.
The many friends of the Opelou
sas youth who has chosen the army
as his career, while they deplore
his departure froml here, feel con
fident, that he will bring honor and
credit to his nation. state and fam
ily. and on that account gladly bid
him the "best 4 l;ok.'

the guest of friends.
exist between the two Counries,
General Funston has not ceased
making all the necesasry provisions
for an invasion of the southern re
public.
The Mexicans were highly indig
nant at the release of the American
prisoners, but Carranza, realizing
what the President had said, de
cided it was for the best of his
country to comply with the wishes
of the United States.
Is is not known whether General
Pershing will remove his entire
army on this side of the Rio Grande,
as it is not at all likely that Uncle
Sam will allow his men to with
draw "from the southern republic
at this stage of the game.
In the meantime the National
Guards of every state have been
mobilized, several of the states be
ing represented on the ~lexican
border, and if war is declared, by
the time the decisioin is made the
United States forces will be sufli
ciently trained for a successful and
rapid invasion of Mexico.
A. D. STEWART ORGANIZING
2nd LOUISIANA REGIMENT
Former St. Landry Representatihe
Is Honored by Adjutant
GOneral McCrory
Major Alfred D. Stewart, who has
been authorized- by Adjutant Gen
eral MeCrory to raise the Second
Louisiana regiment of infantry, is
a trained soldier of many years' ex
perience. Though a native of Ken
tucky lie has been so long identi
fled with Louisiana, and particu
larly with New Orleans, as to right
fully consider this his home in al
most every sense. He is 46 years of
ag.. . rn m adiz, rhgg county,
Ky., and a man of commanding
presence and affable manners.
Since he was 16 years of age
Major Stewart has been identified
with military commands, and has
served in all the positions of com
missioned officers. When the war
with Spain came in 1898 it found
Major Stewart in the militia ser
vite of his native state, and he wept
into the volunteer service as first
'lieutenant of. infantry volunteers,
and served for two years in Cuba
under the command of Colonel
Thos. J. Smith,of Bowling Green,
Ky, being mustered out with an en
dorsement "services honest and
faithful" on his discharge papers.
Major Stewart came to New Or
leans immediately after the war
and has been at home in New Or
leans ever since. For the past two
years he has been manager of' the
Cosmopolitan Hotel, and has the
credit of having made a paying
venture of that hostelry. His busi
ness as a boniface has thrown
Major Stewart in contact with the
leading. men of Louisiana, and this
wide acquaintance led to his elec
tion as a member of the General
Assembly under the late adminis
tration from St. . Landry parish.
Upon his popularity in the coun
try parishes is largely built the
conviction that the Second Louis
iana will be speedily at full
strength, and his wide circle of,
friends in the city and the popu
larity of the line officers in New
Orleans engaged in forming new
companies warrant their friends in
asserting the city companies will
give the country units a close race
for mustering hono'rs.-New Or

PRORiES$IVE PARTY
DIESNATURAL DEATHl
Theodore Roose.elt Announces Ilts
Intention of Supporting Hughes
PARKER REFUSES TO GO
TO THE REPUBLICAN CAMP
Louisiana Man Nominated for Vice
President on Bull Moose Ticket
Will Not Support Jlstice
The progressive party, which was
born in Chicago, on August 7, 191I
when Theodore Roosevelt and fol
lowers, bolted the republican con
vention, because it would not nomi
nate him for president, is virtually
dead. The creator and founder of
the most powerful baby party has,
gone back to the republican fold,
leaving the men who fought bitter
ly for him at the 1912 and 1916 pro
gressive conventions, to fight their
own battles, but urging them' to
support Justice Hughes for presi
dent.
John Parker, of Louisiana, who
was f nominated for vice president
by the progressive convention at
Chicago the early part of June, has
refused to follow his chief into the
republican camp, stating that the
republican leaders are Selfish and
have no consideration for the de
sires of the other members of their
party. He, however, says that .he
will strive to keep up the progres
sive party, despite the fact- that he
will be forced to support the dem
ocratic ticket.
In refusing to follow Roosevelt
into the republican party,' John M.
Parker is being consistent with his
,political views during the recent
gubernatorial campaign. His local
friends feel that he has done ex
actly what could be expected of
him, and like him, those who were
going to vote for - Roosevelt. and
Parker, will suppott Woodrow Wil
son.

MISS MALINE HEICBT
Quiet Wedding Is Pertore by
Father Ebeink at
You have it now, dear readers;
you at last know why the make-up
of the Clarion for the past couple of
weeks seemed so strange and why
some advertisements appeared out
of place. Richard H. Price, fore
man of the composing room, has
joined the Benedicts' Leauge and
is now the proud possessor of "a
wife."
Mr. Price was married on Tues
day evening at 6:30 o'clock to
Miss Maline Hebert, pretty young
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Louis
Hebert, prominent citizens of near
Opelousas.
The wedding came as a distinct
surprise to the many friends of the
foreman of the composing room, al
though any reader of the Clarion
could have guessed that "some
thing serious" was to happen. Now
however the Clarion will be "bet
ter looking" than ever, as Mr. Price
has about realized that life is a
real serious proposition.
Mr. and Mrs. Price will make
their home on South Main street;
their little hotne is stocked full of
pretty furniture and the many
friends of the newly weds wish
them a happy, prosperous and long
married life.

July Fourth will be fittingly ob

It is the earnest hope of the local

automobile owner in the pariph is
cordially invited to participate in
the parade.
The Opelousas Patriotic Band,

JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO BE
ENERGETICALLY OPPOSED
Payton R. Sandoz Says that Both

Garland Will Have Opposition
Peyton R. Sandoz, who has been
mentioned frequently as a possi
Me candidate against -Judge B. 4.
Davy, in a statement to the editor
the Clarion states in most em
patic language that both Judge B.
i" Pavy and District, Attorney R.
Lee garland will `be opposed.
Tn his statement Mr. Sandoz says:
pealed to bY the people all over the
district for information as to
whether or not there would be op
position to Judge Pavy and District
Attorney Garland at the September
,primary that, possibly, some pub
lic statement from me may be ex
pected. You may assure , your
readers, and quote me as your au
thority, that both Judge -Pavy and
District Attorney Garland will be
actively and energetically opposed
at the primdry election in Sep
tember."
For the past several weeks ru
mors of various candidates for ju
dicial offices were afloat, but as
yet no one has fully made up his.
mind to battle against the present
incumbents, Judge Pavy and Dis
trict Attorney Gariand. A report
from Evangeline had it that Sam
Gardiner, a young lawyer of Ville
Platte, had his eye on Lee Gar
land's scalp; it is understood that
John W. Lewis will probably get in
the mix-up, while Peyton Sandoz
has been looked upon for some
time as the likely candidate for
judge. In fact, during the recent
sheriff campaign, it was said, that
James W. Lewis, at a Eunice
meeting for Sheriff Swords, had in
troduced Mr. Sandoz as "the next

JUP. PLUVIUS BREAKS UP
PRETTY GAME OF BALL
Opelousas Emerged Victorious In
Six Inning Contest With Kinder
By I to 0 Score
Old Jupiter Pluvius broke up the
prettiest game of baseball seen in
this city for many years, when he
interrupted a well played and close
contest between Opelousas and the
slugging nine, which represents
Kinder on the basebal map.
At the last half of the sixth in
ning the rain came down in torrents
for a few minutes, just long enough
to frighten the slim crowd and to
wet the grounds, when Opelousas
had one run to the good, having
prevented Kinder from crossing the
pan.
The game was a veritable pitch
ers' battle, but Bienvenu of the lo
cals, who was touched for two
scratch hits, was master of the sit
uation, although Gillam, of Kinder,
also pitched a beautiful game. The
local boy, however, on two occa
sions, when bases were frill, due to
a few misplays, pulled out of the
hole by striking ouit batters. Every
time that Kinder threatened to
score and Bienvenu would grace
fully retire the visitors the crowd
sas and Garden City will begin at
four o'clock sharp.
It is expected that a large num
ber of people throughout the par
ish and surrounding country will
come to Opelousas for the occasion
and it is believed by the promoters
of the parade that the affair will be
a howling success. It is argued
that the Elks usually succeed in
whatever they take up and that
this event will far surpass all ex
pectations.
All the banks will be closed in
honor of the birth of the United
States and it would not be at all
improbable that a number of busi
ness houses close during the hour
of the parade, at least.
July Fourth, especially at this
time, recalls history of the heroes of
the past, with visions of future
heroes before the mind of the pop
ulace of the United States. Prac
tically every city in the United
States of any consequence is
planning to fittingly observe Inde
pendence Day and it is not at all
out of place for Opelousas to put its
best foot foward for that day.
would go wild with excitement.
Opelousas' only tally came in the
irst inning, when Foster Tate,
fleet-footed Eunice boy, who plays
third for the locals, sent a stinging
grounder at Gillam, which was too
hot to handle and reached first
base; Brown, next up, laid down a
pretty sacrifice hit, in front of the
pitcher, Tate reached second base.
Charles Dejean, next up, sent a hot
one between third and short, whiich
was good for two base ,s bUt -,- he..
was satisfied; to remain at Airst
while Tate ished in b en !
hurler settled down to business and
never allowed Opelousas to tothreat
en the plate again.
Barret, Tate, McKinney, and
Thompson played spectacular -ball
in the field, eaeh one robbing at
least one Kinder player of a hit
The Opelousas team, as a Whole
played magnificent ball, the local
boys proving beyond .a shadow of
a doubt that they will be reckoned
with before the amateur champion..
ship of the state is awarded to any
other team.
It was distressing, indeed to the
Opelousas boys, to witness suih a
slim attendance at the game last
'Sunday. Manager Dejean, who has
been working like a Trojan to give
the Opelousas fans a splendid team,
and has virtually succeeded,. is
very anxious that his team will be
patronized. He expects Opeloi
sas to turn out in full force on
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, when
a three game series with Garden City
will be staged.
