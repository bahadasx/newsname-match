REPUBLICAN PLATFORM
It Calls For Preparedness and
Protection of American Rights.
Chicago, June 10.Following Is the plat
form adopted by the Republican national
convention:
In 1861 the Republican party stood for
the Union. As It stood for the union of
states it now stands for a united people,
.rue to American ideals, loyal to Ameri
can traditions, knowing no allegiance ex
cept to the constitution, to the govern
ment and to the flag of the United States.
We believe in American policies at home
and abroad.
Protection of American Rights.
We declare that we believe in and will
enforce the protection of every American
citizen in all the rights secured to him by
the constitution, treaties and the law of
nations, at home and abroad, by land and
sea. These rights, which, in violation of
the specific promise of their party, made
at Baltimore in 1912, the Democratic pres
ident and the Democratic congress have
failed to defend, we will unflinchingly
intain.
We desire pce, the peace of Justice
and right, and believe in maintaining a
straight and honest neutrality between
the belligerents in the great war in Eu
rope. We must perform all our duties and
Insist upon all our rights as neutrals, with
out fear and without favor. We believe
that peace and neutrality as well as the
dignity and influence of the United States
cannot be preserved by shifty expedients,
by phrasemaking, by performances in lan
guage or by attitudes ever changing in
an effort to secure groups of voters.
The present administration has destroy
ed our Influence abroad and humiliated us
In our own eyes. The Republican party
believes that a Arm, consistent and cour
ageous foreign policy, always maintained
by Republican presidents In accordance
with American traditions is the best, as
It is the only true way to preserve our
peace and restore us to our rightful place
among the natlona We believe in the pa
cific settlement of International disputes
and favor the establishment of a world
court for that purpose.
Mexico.
We deeply sympathize with the 15,000,000
'j&ople of Mexico who, for three years,
have seen their country devastated, their
homes destroyed, their fellow citizens
murdered and their women outraged by
armed bands of desperadoes led by self
seeking, conscienceless agitators.
We express our horror and indignation
at the outrages which have been and are
being perpetrated by these bandits upon
American men and women who were or
are in Mexico by invitation of the laws
and of the government of that country
and whose rights to security of person
and property are guaranteed by solemn
treaty obligations. We denounce the in
defensible methods of interference em
ployed by this administration in_ the in
ternal affairs of Mexico and refer with
shame to its failure to discharge the duty
of this country as next friend to Mexico,
its duty to other powers who Jiave relied
upon us as such friend and its duty to our
citizens in Mexico In permitting the con
tinuance of such conditions, first, by fail
ure to act promptly and firmly, and, sec
ond, by lending its influence to the con
tinuation of such conditions through rec
ognition of one of the factions responsible
for these outrages.
We pledge our aid in restoring order and
maintaining peace in Mexico. We prom
ise to our citizens on and near our border
and to those in Mexico, wherever they
may be found, adequate and absolute pro
tection in their lives, liberty, and property.
Monroe Doctrine.
We reaffirm our approval of the Mon
roe doctrine and declare its maintenance
|obea policy of this country essential
to its present and future peace and safety
and to the achievement of its manifest
destiny.
Latin America.
We favor the continuation of Republican
policies, which will result in drawing more
and more closely the commercial, finan
cial and social relations between this coun
try and the countries of Latin America.

FOR PRESIDENT
Charles Evans Hughes
OF NEW YORK
::l
Philippines.
We renew our allegiance to the Philip
pine policy Inaugurated by McKinley, ap
proved by congress and consistently car
ried out by Roosevelt and Taft. Even in
this short time it has enormously improv
ed the material and social conditions of
the islands, given the Philippine people a
constantly Increasing participation in their
government and, if persisted in, will bring
still greater benefits in the future.
We condemn the Democratic administra
tion for its attempt to abandon the Phil
ippines which was prevented only by the
vigorous opposition of Republican mem
bers of congress, aided by a few patriotic
Democrats.
Treaty With Russia.
We reiterate our unqualified approval of
the action taken in December. 1911. by
the president and congress to secure with
Russia, as with other countries, a treaty
that will recognize the absolute right of
expatriation and prevent all discrimina
tion of whatever kind between American
citizens, whether native born or alien,
and regardless of race, religion or pre
vious political allegiance. We renew the
pledge to observe this principle and to
maintain the right of asylum, which is
neither to be surrendered nor restricted,
and we unite in the cherished hope that'
the war which is now desolating the world
may speedily end with a complete and
lasting restoration of brotherhood among
the nations of the earth and the assur
ance of full equal rights, civil and reli
gious, to all men in every land.
Protection of the Country.
In order to maintain our peace and
make certain the security of our people
within our own borders, the country must
have not only adequate, but thorough and
complete national defense, ready for any
emergency. We must have a sufficient
and effective regular army and a provi
sion for ample reserves, already drilled
and disciplined, who can be called at once
to the colors when danger comes.
We must have a navy so strong and so
well proportioned and equipped, so thor
oughly ready and prepared that no enemy
can gain eommand of the sea and effect a
landing in force on either our western or
our eastern coasts. To secure these re
sults we must have a coherent and con
tinuous policy of national defense, which
ven in these perilous days the Democrat
ic party has utterly failed to develop, but
which we promise to give to the country.
Tariff.
The Republican party stands now, as
always, in the fullest sense for the policy
of tariff protection to American industries
and American labor and does not regard
an anti-dumping provision as an adequate
substitute. Such protection should be rea
sonable in amount, but sufficient to pro
tect adequately American industry and
American labor and be so adjusted as to
prevent undue exactions by monopolies or
trusts. It should, moreover, give special
attention to securing the industrial inde
pendence of the United States, as in the
case of dyestuffs.
Through wise tariff and industrial legis
lation our industries can be so organized
that tiiey will become not only a commer
cial bulwark, but a powerful aid to na
tional defense.
The Underwood tariff act is a complete
ranure In every respect. Under its admin
istration imports have enormously in
creased in spite of the fact that the inter
course with foreign countries has been
largely cut off by reason of the war, while
the revenues, of which we stand in such
dire need, have been greatly reduced. Un
der the normal conditions which prevailed
prior to the war, it was clearly demon
strated that this act deprived the Amer
ican producer and the American wage
earner of that protection which entitled
them to meet their foreign competitors,
and, but for the adventitious conditions
created by the war, would long since have
paralyzed all forms of American indus
try and deprived American labor of its
Just reward.
It has hot in the least reduced the cost
of living, which has constantly advanced
from the date of its enactment. The wel
fare of our people demands its repeal and
the substitution of a measure which, in
peace as well as in war, will produce am-,
pie revenue and give reasonable protec
tion to all forms of American production
In mine, forest, field and factory.
We favor the creation of a tariff com
mission, with complete power to gather

congress in all matters relating to the
tariff.
Business.
The Republican party has long believed
In the rigid supervision and strict regula
tion of transportation and great cor
porations of the country. It has put its
creed into its deeds, and all really effec
tive laws regulating the railroads and the
great industrial corporations are the work
of Republican congresses and presidents.
For this policy of regulation and super
vision the Democrats, in a stumbling and
piecemeal way, are undertaking to involve
the government in business which should
be left within the sphere of private en
terprise and indirect competition with its
own citizens, a policy which is sure to re
sult in waste, great expense to the tax
payer and in an inferior product.
The Republican party firmly believes
that all who violate the laws in regula
tion of business should be individually
punished. But prosecution is very differ
ent from persecution, and business suc
cess, no matter how honestly attained, is
apparently regarded by the Democratic
party as in itself a crime. Such doctrines
and beliefs choke enterprise and stifle
prosperity. The Republican party believes
in encouraging American business as it
believes in and will seek to advance all
American interests.
Rural Credits.
We favor an effective system of rural
credits as opposed to the ineffective law
proposed by the present Democratic ad
ministration.
Rural Free Delivery.
We favor the extension of the rural free
delivery system and condemn the Demo
cratic administration for curtailing and
crippling it
Merchant Marine.
In view of the policies adopted by all
the maritime nations to encourage their
shipping interests, and in order to enable
us to compete with them for the ocean
carrying trade, we favor the payment to
Bhips engaged in the foreign trade of lib
eral compensation for services actually
rendered in carrying the mails and such
further legislation as will build up an ade
quate American merchant marine and
give us ships which may be requisitioned
by the government in time of national
emergency.
We are utterly opposed to the govern
ment ownership of vessels as proposed by
the Democratic party because government
owned ships, while effectively preventing
the development of the American mer
chant marine by private capital, will be
entirely unable to provide for the vapt
volume of American freights and will
leave us more helpless than ever in the
hard grip of foreign syndicates.
Transportation.
Interstate and intrastate transportation
has become so interwoven that the at
tempt to apply two and often several sets
of laws to its regulation has produced
conflicts of authority, embarrassment in
operation and inconvenience and expense
to_the public.
The entire transportation system of the
country has become essentially national.
We, therefore, favor such action by legis
lation or, if necessary, through an amend
ment to the constitution of the United
States as will result in placing it under
exclusive federal control.
Economy and a National Budget.
The increasing cost of the national gov
ernment and the need for the greatest
economy of its resources, in .nrdAr t* moot
tne growing demands ot the people for
government service, call for the severest
condemnation of the wasteful appropria
tions of this Democratib administration,
of its shameless raids on the treasury and
of its opposition to and rejection of Presi
dent Taft's oft repeated proposals and
earnest efforts to secure economy and ef
ficiency through the establishment of a
simple, businesslike budget system, to
which we pledge our support.
Conservation.
We believe in a careful husbandry of
all the natural resources of the nationa
husbandry which means development
without waste, use without abuse.
Civil Service Reform.
The civil service law has always been
sustained by the Republican party, and
we renew our repeated declaration that
It hall h* thnraiurhlv .and haivuUv
FOR VICE PRESIDENT
Charles W. Fairbanks
OF INDIANA
ST. PAUL AUD MINNEAPOLIS. MINN.. SATURDAY: JULY 1,1916
rorcea ana extended' wherever practicable.
The Democratic party has created since
March 4, 1913, 30,000 offices outside of the
civil service law at an annual cost of $44,-
000,000 to the taxpayers .of the Country.
Territorial Matters.
Reaffirming the attitude long maintained
by the Republican party, we hold that offi
cials appointed to administer the govern
ment of any territory should be bona fide
residents of the territory in which their
duties are to be performed.
Labor Laws.
We pledge the Republican party to the
faithful enforcement of all federal laws
passed for the protection of labor. We
favor vocational education, the enactment
and rigid enforcement of a federal child
labor law, the enactment of a generous
and comprehensive workmen's compensa
tion law, within the commerce power of
congress, and an accident compensation
law covering all government employee*
We favor the collection and collation un
der the direction of the department of la
bor of complete data relating to industrial
hazards for the Information of congress,
to the end that such legislation may be
adopted as may be calculated to secure
the safety, conservation and protection of
labor from the dangers incident to Indus
try and transportation.
Suffrage.
The Republican party, reaffirming Its
faith of government of the people, by the
people, for the people, as a measure of
justice to one-half the adult people of
this country, favors the extension of the
suffrage to women, but recognizes the
right of each state to settle this question
for itself.
Such are our principles, such are our
purposes and policies. We close as we
began. The times are dangerous and the
future is fraught with peril. We ap
peal to all Americans, whether natural
ized or native born, to prove to the world
that we are Americans in thought and in
deed, with one loyalty, one hope, one as
piration. We call on all Americans to be
true to the spirit of America, to the great
traditions of their common country and,
above all things, to keep the faith.
JAIL BETTER THAN HOME.
Kruse Paid to Stay There Rather
Than With His Relatives.
Chicago. August Kruse, who for
five years has been a voluntary inmate
of the Du Page county jail at Wheaton,
IH., rather than live with relatives,
who doubted his sanity, told the sher
iff he was going west to live on a
farm.
Kruse paid the county $1 a day for
the privilege of living in the jail. In
1906 a petition to have him declared
insane was heard in the county court
He was found to be sane, but would
not return to his home, and after five
years' absence returned to Wheaton
and arranged for quarters in the same
jail to which he had been taken years
before.
"I want to get back to the farm,"
said Kruse. "I sit here and think of
what I used to do, and I'm going to be
gin over again. I'm going away off,
though, not back to the old farm."

AN OPEN LETTER TO ROBERT
RUSSA MOTON.
(From the Crisis.)
The Crisis hastens to extend to you
on your accession to the headship of
Tuskegee the assurances of its good
will and personal respect. The Crisis
does this all the more willingly be
cause it has to some extent been the
mouthpiece of many who have had oc
casion repeatedly to criticize the
words and deeds of your predecessor.
It would be a matter of hope and
rejoicing if your assumption of new
duties could be the beginning of a
new era of union and understanding
among the various groups of Ameri
can Negroes.
But understanding and co-operation
must be based on frank conference
and clear knowledge. As a prelimi
nary step to such understanding the
Crisis ventures in this open letter to
express to you publicly its hopes and
fears.
It hopes that the aims of the col
ored American have become suffi
ciently clear to admit of no misunder
standing or misstatement. We desire
to become American citizens with
every right that pertains to citizen
ship:
1. The right to vote and hold office.
2. Equality before the law.
3.. Equal civil rights in all public
places, and in all public services.
4. A. proportional share in the bene
fits of all public expenditures.
5. Education according to ability
and aptitude.
With these rights we correlate our
duties as men and citizensthe aboli
tion of poverty, the emancipation of
women, the suppression of crime and
the overcoming of ignorance.
The Crisis assumesindeed, it
knowsthat in these matters you be
lieve substantially, as we do, and that
the real differences between us, if
there be such, lie in matters of pres
ent emphasis and present procedure.
We assume, without demur, that
following the late Booker T. Wash
ington you will place especial em
phasis %on vocational training, prop
erty getting and conciliation of the
white South. These are necessary
and against these the Crisis speaks
policies, but they have their pitfalls,
this warning word:
1. Only the higher and broader
training will give any race its ulti
mate leadership. This Mr. Washing
ton came to realize, and this you must
not forget.
2. Individual accumulation of wealth
must gradually and inevitably give
way to methods of social accumula
tion and equitable distribution.
3. Finally: Conciliation is wise and
proper. But how far shall it go? It
is here that the Crisis confesses to its
deepest solicitude in your case. It
cannot but remember its unanswered
query of you in the case of the St.
Louis luncheon. It has before it the
heading of a Rochester paper which
gives as your opinion that "from
North one gets distorted view of
South." And finally, there is the re
cent case of the Pullman car and your
family.
The Crisis will assume in all of
these cases that you have not been
correctly reported that you did not
voluntarily give up lunching at the
St. Louis City Club that you did not
assert that the South was maligned
usually at the North, and above all,
that you did not say that you had no
sympathy with the attempt of mem
bers of your family to ride on Pull
man cars in the South.
The Crisis laiows only too well the
way in which Southern newspapers
put such sentiments into the mouths
of colored leaders but the point upon
which we insist is this: that such
atrocious statements cannot be al
ways passed in silence.
We do not wish the principal of
Tuskegee to spend his valuable time
in answering calumnies and misstate
ments, but we do believe that when
so monstrous a statement is made, as
in the case of the Pullman car, some
thing besides silence and acquiescence
is called for.
We hope to see, therefore, at Tus
kegee in the future a carrying out
and development of the best of its
past work and a continued attempt to
come to terms of understanding with
the best of the white South but to
these policies we hope to see added a
policy of making it clearly understood
to the people of this country that Tus
kegee does believe in the right to
vote that it does not believe in Jim
Crow cars that it {recognizes the
work of the Negro colleges, and that it
agrees with Charles Sumner that
"Equality of rights is the first of
rights."
This, then, is the forward step at
Tuskegee which the Crisis and its
friends look for under your adminis
tration, and it desires to express its
earnest hope, and indeed its faith,
that you will not disappoint your fel
low workers.
Servility Brings Contempt.
(From the Union, Cincinnati, O.)
If the above is true (referring to
the "Moton Incident") then Major
Moton will rise to fame and fortune
as did his illustrious predecessor.
"Crooking the pregnant hinges of the
knee that thrift may follow fawning"
brings wealth from the great masses
of white people alright, but it also
brings a vast amouni of contempt.
There is so much bowing, cringing
and nauseating servility shown by
some of our people, is it any wonder
that even the 25th class of white
people feel that they are the Lord's
annointed, and therefore vastly supe
rior to all colored people?

Unless He Can Talk Like a Man.
(From the Richmond Planet.)
Principal R. R. Moton has gone to
work. It would be well for him to
Keep at it and to have nothing further
to say about that Pullman sleeping
car incident.
An Apologist
(From the Washington. Bee.)
The Bee, at the time Major Moton
was named by a committee of apolo
gists, said then that he was a "Hand
Picked Leader."
The condition of the colored race
in this country is due to these "hand
picked leaders." Now, in the first
place, Major Moton represents a class
of white men and not the Colored
Americans.
He is not only a "hand-picked
leader" but an apologist who fails to
resent an insult. Would any Ameri
can white man of any nationality at
tempt to make excuses for an insult
to his wife by a common carrier.
Has this not been the policy of all
hand picked leaders? This hand
picked representative apologizes for
the insult offered his wife while en
route to her home. Will Major Mo
ton, the newly installed principal of
Tuskegee, enter a suit for damages?
No, he would offer an apology to those
who had insulted his good wife. The
Bee has always been an admirer of
Major Moton, and thought that he
possessed manly traits, that would
commend him to the thoughtful con
sideration of the American black
race, but The Bee must confess that
he is a hand-picked leader and an
apologist.
Must Contend for Rights.
(From Richmond Planet.)
We do not just- understand the
position of Principal Robert R. Moton
in the matter There is no
other course to pursue than to con
tinue to contend for rights denied,
even though-we. are rebuked and disr
appointed in so doing. No question
is ever settled until it is settled right.
We must continue to appeal to the
conscience of the American people.
We must continue to attempt to en
force our rights through the courts of
the land, even though some of them
may be prejudiced against us.
THE HAND PICKED LEADER.
(From the Kansas Elevator.)
The Elevator would like to know if
the time has not arrived when colored
men should select their own leaders
instead of leaving the delicate task to
the hands of designing men of the op
posite race, and if any colored man
can serve two masters at one and the
same time, and if as a general proposi
tion, the "hand picked leader" is not
always against his race?
Stand Squarely for Justice.
(From the Omaha Monitor.)
Major Moton, please don't assume
the attitude of an apologist. We are
hoping for big things from you. We
know and appreciate the difficulties
of your position. Stand squarely and
firmly for justice to your race. No
apology is due from either Mrs. Mo
ton or yourself, because as a cultured
and refined woman she preferred to
ride in a Pullman rather than in a
"Jim Crow" car in which "equal ac
commodations" are not provided, and
in which the conditions are seldom
sanitary or pleasant.
No Very High Opinion.
(From the Nashville Globe.)
We entertain no very high opinion
of President Moton's explanation to
the Associated Press Correspondent
at Montgomery, anent that sleeping
car episode. We trust he was in
correctly quoted.
Major Moton's First Duty.
(From the New York News.)
The future of the great work at
Tuskegee, may call for an offending
silence, but it will never be helped
long or to any great degree by an
abject surrender of the race's rights.
Major Moton's first duty to himself
and his race is to set himself now and
at all times four square with the pro
gress of his people.
RESENTMENT NEEDED.
(APPEAL Editorial, June 3)
After having been granted Pullman
tickets-from Montgomery, Alabama to
Savannah, Georgia, the wife of Major
Robert R. Moton, recently installed
as principal of Tuskegee Institute, and
Blanton Moton, his brother, were
ejected from the car by "two police
men and some of the best citizens" of
Troy, Ala. Although they had paid
Pullman fares and were interstate pas
sengers, both were forced to ride in
the jimcrow car.
The wires tell us that when Major
Moton was informed of the matter, he
condoned it saying that he "respected
the traditions of the South and had no
resentment against the people who
committed the outrage."

Has Shown His Hand.
(From the Cleveland Gazette.)
Four days after the inauguration as
principal of Tuskegee, Ala., Normal
and Industrial Institute the South
forces Major Moton to "show his
hand and there is not even a "deuce"
in it for the race. One thing sure
and that is from a racial standpoint
he is certainly no improvement upon
Booker T. Washington.
THE MOTON INCIDENT.
(From the Cleveland Gazette.)
Major Robert Moton has recently
been installed as principal of Tuske
gee, Ala., N. and I. Institute. He
made a favorable impression while
here in Rochester. Everyone regrets
to know that his wife was subjected
to such brutal treatment as to be
driven out of a Pullman car in Ala
bama. It appears, according to re
ports, that the riding in a Pullman
car by the Motons had been a subject
of discussion before the journey was
begun. Mrs. Moton felt that she was
clearly within her rights to ride in a
Pullman car anywhere it went. The
white passengers complained of her
presence and when everything was
opportune, they depended upon the
usual law-breaking officials of Alabama
to drive a defenseless woman out of
the car, in which she could travel with
comfort and ease, into a "jim-crow"
car, where vermin dwelt. It is very
unfortunate for the white passengers
that their selfish ease and comfort
had made them snobs to the extent
that they objected to the presence of
the wife of the principal of Tuskegee
Normal and Industrial Institutethe
school that the country says is "the
colored man's finest educational
asset.' Is it possible that any white
woman could be so robbed of the milk
of kindness and womanly instincts
that she would urge the driving of a
refined mother out of her berth which
she had purchased, which the com
pany had accepted the money for, in
order that white supremacy might get
another boost? Above all do we re
gret the reported statement issued by
Major Moton. He did not stand by
his wife in her fight for her rights.
He advised the submission to in
human oppression. He is quoted as
saying that he "has the highest re
gard for the traditions of the South,
he having been born there." We
commend him for his consideration
of the South, but we are amazed,
however, at his foresaking his wife in
this hour of her humiliation. We also
have respect for the traditions of the
South that are humane and just, but
we denounce and opiose the recent
traditions of the South," which
make them lynch, burn, oppress and
degrade the colored race under the
disguise of "Southern chivalry and
greatness." The officer that ejected
Mrs. Moton was a law-breaker and
coward. The Pullman company that'
received her money and gave her a
berth had the right to protect her. If
we are to choose between life, respect
and rights on the one hand and Tus
kegee that will teach cringing sub
mission to wrong and injustice in
order to exist in the world, we choose
the former. Between Major Moton
and his courageous wife in this in
stance there is no real choice. Fair
minded men and women of all races
sympathize with and stand by Mrs
Moton. If Tuskegee is to be con
tinued as a mill to turn out colored
boys and girls who are spineless and
cowards when their civil rights are at
stake, the sooner it goes to the wall
the better it will be for all concerned.
Great buildings, imposing machinery,
beautiful grounds and varied indus
tries amount to naught when the real
thing, MANHOOD, is crushed out.
Major Moton should understand now
that Tuskegee is a nation's school.
The millions now being sought for
from all races should remain in hid
ing if the inhuman and brutal prac
tices of the worst element of the
South are to determine its policy. If
the best whites of the South acquiesce
in it, then we say move Tuskegee
where it can develop character and
MANHOOD. The "jim-crow" car
must be fought and the time is oppor
tune to fight when one of the fore
most women of the land has been so
shamelessly humiliated and appar
ently foresaken by her strong de
fender. Major Moton's task is a dif
ficult one, but let him start right If
the advice given his brother and wife
is characteristic of what he will give
students, we quake and tremble for
colored boys and girls.
