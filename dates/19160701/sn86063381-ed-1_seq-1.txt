MEXICAN REPLY TO
UNITEDSTATESWILL
NOT BE DEFIANT
United Press Learns That Note Will
Be Firm and Will Emphasize
Withdrawal of Troops.
STATEMENT ISSUED FOR
4
HOME CONSUMPTION
Troops Still Being Rusned to Border
No Change in Entire
situation.
(By United Press*)
Washington, July 1.Contrary to5^
reports, the United Press today
learned that Carranza's reply to
President Wilson will not be defiant.
He will send a firm note emphasizing'
that he considers that the U. &.'
troops in Mexico are an infringement
upon Mexican sovereignity. p.
For Home Consumption.^
The statement issued b^the forp*^
eign office in Mexico City yesterday
was for home consumption.
The foreign office in Mexico City
yesterday issued a memorandum in.
reply to Secretary Lansing's recent
note, in which the correctness of sev^/'J
eral statements is denied. -/V
The memorandum contains thirty
five counts. Although not in the
form of a direct reply to the Wash-"^
ington note, it is considered equiv-^
alent to an answer to that document.5^
It expresses surprise that the Wash-3^
ington government should have been
pained at the tone and the contents**^*
of the Carranza document, since it
maintains that the United States has^'ll
sent to the Constitutional govern- j?*
ment not only one, but many discour-"|
teous and even overbearing notes
Not Protected Bandits.
%J^
ican government's position denying
the right of the United States to keep**^
aymed bodies in Mexico, the membr
^dB^denies Ke^geticaliy that tbe^Sf
Mexican government has protected^
bandits who had committeed depreda
tions in the United States, and defies.
Washington to produce proof of the
assertion.
Blame for the Santa Ysabel mas
sacre is placed on the so-called im
pulsive and irascible disposition of
Charles Watson, general manager of
Cusihuiriachic company, and Gen.
Scott and Gen. Funston are accused
of bad faith and lack of honor in mis
leading Gen. Obregon into an alleged
evasive reply regarding the crossing
of American troops into Mexico after
the Glenn Springs raid.
The memorandum asserts that j,
while it is true that the United
States arrested Gen. Huerta, the mo- ^Jj
tive which prompted this act was not
for a purpose of aiding the Consti- s.
tutional government, but because the
United States feared that Huerta was
plotting to aid Germany. The note
concludes by declaring that the
presence of American troops in Mex
ico invites rather than prevents ban- A
dit raids along the border.
l'j
Campaign Issue. Jj
i^ Washington, July 1.Politicians
here consider that President Wilson
took his Mexican policy for a cam- j*
paign issue, following the New York
Wesa club address last night. .fi
No War Says Wilson. JjJ
"New York, July 1.President
Wilson made it plain in his speech
at the New York Press club banquet
last night that he will not counten
ance a war with Mexico until there is
no other alternative for settling the "-M
border trouble.
Again he declared that he was ir^%
ready to sacrifice his own political
fortunes in order to carry out his
convictions as to what would be the
just course to pursue in the sttua
tion.
The president's audience, com
posed of newspaper men, state and
municipal officers, political leaders
and other men prominent in
publte,^^,j3i||J~1'*fef life, signified their endorsement"
his position by repeated outbursts oW%
applause. When asked if the glory
of America would be enhanced by a
war of conquest in Mexico, shouts of
"no" came from all parts of the ban
