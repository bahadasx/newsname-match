BALLOT DECIDED UPON TAKE LEAD IN
AFTER CONFERENCE FAILS
If Walkout Is Declared 400,000
Employes In U. S. Will
Quit Jobs.
NEW YORK, July 1.—The four
reat railroad brotherhoods are now
balloting on the question of whether
or not) to strike for an 8-hour day
with yime and a half pay for over­
time work. More than 400,000 men
will vote in this referendum and
when the voting is completed the
chairmen of the general, adjustment
committees of the four brotherhoods
will come io New York for the count­
ing of the votes. The chaairmen and
the officers of the four unions' will
meet in New York about, August 1
for the vote count and a second con­
ference with the National Conference
committee representing the railroads
of the United States.-
The general strike balloting fol­
lows the unsuccessful efforts of the
brotherhoods to get their demands
accepted at a conference that began
in New York City, June 1. The rail­
road managers presented a counter
proposition that was not acceptable
to officers of the brotherhoods, so
the conferees broke up after two
weeks of discussion.
Strike Sentiment Strong.
General strike sentiment, appears
to be strong in all parts of the coun­
try. although the brotherhoods have
never been through a general strike.
The last big strike in the railroad in­
dustry was in the summer of 1894
when the American Railway union,
headed by Eugene V. Debs, tied up
the railroads in the west for 30 days.
That strike waas the most bitterly
fought of any labor uprising in the
history of the nation.
Federal troops were sent to Chi­
cago by President Cleveland to break
the strike. It was in this strike that
the workers of the United States saw
how completely the power of money
had secured control of the courts and
all the machinery of the states and
nation. Governor Altgeld stood alone
iji Jlinoia in his determination to give
the workers a square deal.
Whether the'railroad magnates will
call out the federal troops to drive
the strikers back to work, or wheth­
er they will be called into the militia
organizations of the separate states
and ordered to run the trains like the
strikers of France were forced back
to work is more than any railroad
union official can predict.
Easy to Win Strike.
Grand Chief Warren S. Stone, of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive En­
gineers, says the railroad brother­
hoods will be able to win the strike
with ease because the magnates will
unable to procure strike breakers.
There are not enough skilled men in
the nation to take the places of the
400,000
brotherhood men if they quit.
The other officers of the brother­
hoods, who will lead in the negotia­
tions with the conference committee
in about
30
days and who will lead,
in the general strike, if there is one,
arc President Austin B. Garretson, of
the Order of Railway Conductors
President Carter, of the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Firemen and Engine
men, and President W. G. Lee, of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen.
These officers are at their head­
quarters now, waiting for reports of
the balloting on all the railroads of
the United States. They have made
it very plain to the railroad managers
that they will not tolerate interfer­
ence with any of the local chairmen
•who are voting the men. Although
Elisha Lee, assistant general manag
ero of the Pennsylvania railroad*, has
assured the brotherhoods that their
members will not be harassed during
the voting, a close watch is being
kept on them. If railroad workers
are discriminated against tyere is a
possibility of strikes to avenge the
wrongs.
BREWERIES SIGN AGREEMENT.
HOUSTQN, Texas, June 28.—Local
breweries have signed a two years'
contract with the Brewery Workers'
union. Wages are increased, non­
union drivers eliminated and the
eight-hour day secured in all depart­
ments except delivery.
TEACHERS OF THE
While Chairman Loeb of the 'Chi­
cago school board is repeating the
puny conceit of most failures in his
tory in trying to stem the tide of
progress, the object of his wrath—the
teachers' organization—is steadily ad­
vancing, says the Union Leader.
The teachers now have a national
organization. They have taken their
pl^ce with the forces of labor in the
bona fide trade union movement.
:The slogan of their organization is:
"Democracy in Education Education
for Democracy." The national organi­
zation was launche'd in Chicago, April
,15, 1916, and became affiliated with
the American' Federation of Labor
May 9, 1916. Its officers are: Chas.

MOVEMENT FOR PEACE
Workers Are Urged to Meet to
Help Ambassadors in Bring­
ing End to War.
Arms and munition: manufacturers
'and all the "infernal Interests" which
are behind and at the bottom of the
artificial agUatfon- 'to plunge this
country into wap are still carrying on
a campaign of misrepresentation and
falsehood through the daily news­
papers.
In the large industrial centers of
the west and' middle1 -west the pur
chaseable and paid press tells in black
headlines to its readers that labor
upon the' Pacific eddst is unanimous­
ly supporting "preparedness par­
ades." Representation are made
that this is -.due to fear of a Japan­
ese invasion.
War Opposed by Labor.
The truth is, that union labor of
California and everywhere else
throughout the nation is unanimously
opposed to was, "preparedness par­
ades," or any other propaganda,
which fosters and stimulates more
hell on this earth.
"Organized labor" of San Francis­
co urges that a peace parade be in­
augurated to ^elebrate Labor day.
Such a parade would be timely and
proper. By that tinke, it is to be
hoped that there will be mediation
and negotiations for the termination
of the great world's war, which has
devasted the European countries and
their colonies now for nearly two
years.
On Labor day, the first Monday in
September, every year.it is customary
to review and record the achieve­
ments of united ltfbor. Its peaceable
conquests of many decades are dwelt
upon and related on that day for the
benefit of younger generations and
the thousands that do not understand
the aims and aspirations of the or­
ganized workers.
Nothing could, therefore, be more
appropriate and fitting than to have
union labor take the lead in a peace
parade' on next Labor •day.
Take labor and the profits of labor
out of "preparedness" and military
operations and all wars will cease.
Now is the best time to begin doing
it.
Workers Urge Peace.
Great nations have been fighting
their best blood has drenched the
battlefields of Europe for the past
22 months —they are sick and tired
of war.
Union labor of America is called
upon by their sisters and brothers
across the ocean to help re-establish
peace on earth and good will among
mankind, and in pursuance thereof
rehabilitate the world on a mote
equitable and lasting basis.
Suggestions have been made that
representatives of the organized
workers in all lands meet simultane­
ously in the same city, or place,
where the ambassadors of the bellig­
erent, governments convene to nego­
tiate and sign the next peace protocol
of the world. The idea is a,good one.
San Francisco has a world-wide
reputatichi for doing big things. The
biggest and best thing for the world
today is peace. Let it be hoped that
San Francisco's labor organizations
will start- the cycle of the new era by
preparing for a peace parade on next
Labor day.

Chicago Board of Education
Erases "Meritorious Service"
Clause From Rule.
-CHICAGO, June 28.—By tactics
characterized
:as
"monstrously out­
rageous," the' board of education
erased the "meritorious service
.clause" from its rules and in effect
threw the whole teaching staff of the
Chicago public schools into, the arena
of political spoils. The resolution
was introduced by President Loeb,'
who was behind the recent resolution
that denied teachers' the right to join
a trade union, and which was later
nullified by the courts.
President Loeb ignored pleas of the.
minority to. hear representatives of
the local federation of labor and the
teachers' federation. Mrs. Mary Mc
Mahon, a member of the board, in
opposing the rule, said:
"I am absolutely in terror for those,
teachers who have incurred the en­
mity of the present board. The
teachers, too, will live in terror."
At a mass meeting last Sunday, at­
tended bV 4,000 citizens, representing
all walks of life, vigorous protests
were made against the efforts to
make Chicago's public schools the
football of politics by abolishing the
merit system, in vogue for over 25
years. A permanent public school
league, pledged to a long campaign
for the establishment, of a democratic
and efficient public school system,
was formed. It was declared the issue
presented to Chicago was national in
its scope.
Secretary Olander of the state fed­
eration of labor, said:
"Heretofore the board had the
right to discharge a teacher for un­
satisfactory work. The Loeb rule
gives it the power to discharge teach­
ers who do satisfactory work—to dis­
charge them for political reasons."
EMPLOYES REJECT
BO-HOUR WEEK AWARD
HAMILTON, Ont., June 28.—Em­
ployers of machinists have refused to
accept the 50-hoiir week award of the
royal commission, and 2,000 machin­
ists and tool-makers employed on war
munitions have suspended work.
The, Employers' Association of
Hamilton is running large advertise­
ments in the daily press against "paid
agitators" who are charged with fo­
menting ^his trouble Recording tto
the ^employers, their machinists and
toolmakers were happy and contented
under the driving strain of, a 10-hour
day. The question of reducing hours
never entered their minds until the
serpent, in the form of a "paid agi­
tator," came in their midst.
The Hamilton Herald takes these
employers to task for their senseless
fulminations and shows that citizens
baling no connection with organized
labor encouraged these metal work
i-ers.
Trade unionists are calling atten­
tion to the recent report of a commit­
tee appointed by the English govern­
ment
(to
investigate conditions of
workers in munitions plants. This
committee declared in favor of- an
eight-hour day and objected to long
hours on the ground that it was in­
jurious to the worker and that It was
false economy.
AMERICAN HARDWARE LEADS
BOSTON, June 28.—While some
Manufacturers are claiming an eight
hour day and high wages place them
at a disadvantage with foreign com­
petitors. Dr. E. E. Pratt, of the fed­
eral department of commerce, told
the National Retail Hardware asso­
ciation that American hardware was
superior to hardware of other coun­
tries and that the American product
possessed the additional merit of
costing less.
"The federal official used samples of
hardware- from five foreign countries
to proVe his point.

MAY FORCE CONSCRIPTION.
ST. PAUL, Minn., July 1.—Con­
scription may be forced upon Minne­
sota men capable of bearing arms, to
recruit the -Minnesota National Guard*
to full war strength. The Minnesota
military code provides for .enrollment
of eligible arms bearers with the. take
ing of each census..
High military, authorities today
said they considered this clause suffi­
cient ground for forcing Minnesota
men to enlistment. The matter may
be brought before the State Supreme
Court for a test
Ing a message of greeting and good
will for a thorough organization'of the
teachers of America that the Amer­
ican Federation of Teachers may be
set on the road of practical, beneficial
work in the interest of the teachers,
of the pupils in the schools, and of
the people of our common country/'
In a printed folder the teachers set
forth what their unions have done for
tfcem and' answer. the objections
raised by their opponents.*
What Teachers' Unions Have Done.
1. Teachers' unions,, have secured
salary increases, and have protected
tenure of position.
2. They have eliminated the arbi­
trary power of supervisors.
3. They have caused reduction in
the size of classes.
4. They have given free advice
and free legai.support to members.

Cincinnati Jurist Declares Labor­
ers Have Right to Organize
Unions.
CINCINNATI, Juno 28.-—The court
of appeals has, dissolved a permanent
injunction against Butchers' union
No. &32 and placed the costs against
the'H. H. Meyer Packing company.
Judge Nippert of thecommon pleas
court. issued the injunction. The
order restrained. strikers from carry,
ing banners which announced that
the Meyer company was non-union.
Judge Nippert said that labor has the
right to organize "toTfurther the in­
terests of the laboring classes," and
then Enjoined the striking butchers
from asking sympathizers to aid
them.
W. F. Fox, attorney lor the union­
ists, commenting on the decision said
that it does not affirmatively fix the
limits to which labor organizations
may go, but It does hold that upon
the statement of facts in the petition
these facts alone will not warrant an
injunction.

Exploitation of Musicians Scored
Conditions In Churches De­
clared Worst'Possible.
NEW YORK, June 28.—Exploita­
tion of musicians by churches is al­
leged and a demand for the organiza­
tion of a union as a means of ade­
quate pay is made in a. letter from a
New York organist printed in The
Musical Courier. /The correpsondent
says in part:
'*Would^ The Musicaal Cotirler.be
interested in supporting" the forma­
tion of a protective union' of church
organists? .We' all know how neces­
sary unions are to workmen in trades,
what their conditions would be with­
out them, and whatT-they are where
unions do not exist.
"The conditions in churches are so
bad they could not be worse. A num­
ber of churches, contrary to custom,
do not name the salaries they will
pay, but require candidates to state
their lowest terms and then appoint
the cheapest, regardless of ability or
anything else. Other churches de­
mand that organists shall play for
prayer^meetings, Sunday schools, etc.
"Now. _that churches perceive how
bad conditions are among the organ­
ists, they are taking1 advantage of the
situation by demanding anything and
everything of them over and above
their legitimate work. .Salaries are
atrociously low, and I^think no class
of people are paid so little in propor­
tion to their ability and expense of
education as the' church organists.
The situation is getting worse all the
time.
"I have several times heard church
musicians say that if they sold their
services to any member of the liquor
trade they Would probably be treated
better, kinder, paid more, etc., than
when they play or sing in churches."
The Musical Courier invites corre­
spondence on the" subject.

STOCK HELD BY BROKERS
NEW YORK, June 28.—It is stated
in Wall Street that from April 1,

United States "Steel Corporation copi
mon stockholders of record dropped
from 56,825 to 41,910, or over 26 per
cent. This is the smallest number of
common shareholders in many years.
This information does not sustain
the claim that the steel trust's stock
Is being purchased by its employes,
thereby "settling" the
.difference be­
tween capitalists, and laborers.
It is also claimed that 50 per cent
of-steel copimon is-now held by bro­
kerage houses. The trust would create

submitted to the platform committee
of the Democratic national conven­
tion the following industrial pypgran^
based on the chief ftiidlntf Of the
main report of the United States
Commission on Industrial Relations.
The program was presented with the
request that it be incprporated in the
party platform:
Economic and Industrial.
"The party in conventipn assem­
bled declares that the problems of
society and government of this timf
are economic and industrial rather
than political. It recognizes peril in
the conditions described In the re­
ports of the Commission on Indus­
trial Relations, wherein two per cent
of the people own 6Cj per cent of the
welath of the nation. It accepts as
proved Jhe statement that the causes
of industrial unrest are:
"Unjust distribution of wealth and
income.
"Unemployment and denial of an
opportunity to earn a living.
"Denial of justice in the creation,
in the adjudication and in the admin­
istration of law.
Denial of the right and opportunity
to form effective organizations.
"We affirm, that whatever our
needs of military defense may be,
preparedness for any emergency in
national lifp must be built *up on the,
prosperity of the workers.
"We recognize the fact that, the
great' mass of American toilers and
producers rightly resent any sort ot
mastery, either that which assumes/to
do good to them, or that which act­
ually exploits them.
"We therefore declare that the
workers should, as a matter of mqral
-and/legal right have^e 'fi|ll«st dp^
portanity to form -organizations,
among themselves and to control
their share in industry through the
power of collective bargaining.
Right -to Organize.
"We demand the fullest encourage­
ment, both- in administrative law and
in the -judicial process, of union labor.
To make this declaration effective we
point out that today and in the past
the power of courts and other legal
processes has been used against the
rights of the workers to associate
themselves in labor unions. We con­
demn these practices as being in'vio­
lation of the spirit, at least, of the
federal law securing to the workers
the legal right of voluntary associa­
tion.
"We denounce the practice, which
prevails in no other civilized country,
of permitting private interests both to
employ the state and national soldiery
and to employ armed guards and de­
tectives to crush out unions, which
are organized to promote the indus­
trial interests of the wage workers.
"We denounce particularly in this
connection the importation from one.
state to another of such armed
guards and of machine guns, armored
cars, motor cars and the like. And
we pledge the enactment of all pos­
sible legislation to prevent such pri­
vate usurpation of power.
"We belieye* the statements of such
men as Prof. Henry R. Seager te bf
indisputable, that no one "can ques­
tion but wh^it our judges have ijjown
a decided bias in. favdr of the' em­
ployers."
"We affirm that the attitude of
government .toward industry and
those engaged in industry is not
manifested alpne. in the making of
laws, but in the administration of
law, both in the administrative and
executive departments, and ip the
courts... We therefore pledge the
party not only to legislate in ffUrness
to those who produce wealth, but al­
so to adopt in every definable and in­
definable way the position that the
workers'should have the fu)l product
of their toil and that they should
have full liberty of action consistent
