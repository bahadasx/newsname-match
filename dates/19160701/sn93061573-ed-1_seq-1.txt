WATER BONDS BRIYG
LARGE PREMIUM ,
. At the regular neeUcf of the
City 'Trostws, last Tue4y
evening the Clayton Water Ex
tension Bonds fosu of 155..
; 600, were sold to Sweet-Causey
-Foster Conapay, of Denver for
' &033.fto, or at a premium of
one thousand and thJrty-Ove
dollars.
Thare were more than a
dozen bidders for the securi
ties and in no instance wan a
premum refused.. The Denver
Arm, however, had Investid
ed the bonds closely and knew
their true value.
Such a premium is the ex
ception rather than the rule, of
bond buyers in buying bonds of
small towns, and show the pro
sperity and business outlook
of Clayton to be greater than is
iisinil with (host towns of an
equal population.
Iteeroiling OITlccr Coming
:jnta Fe. .Tunc 27. Lieut .lark
Collins ami Jack Chavez expert tn go
to Clayton next week to seek recruits
for the .New .Mexico .National Ouard.
They have met with consiileralile
success the past few week hut have
a lot more work cut out for them
in view of the urgent demand for
(0 nvore guardsmen to enable the
state to have its regiment mustered
into the regular sen ice.
The (lilllcully of getting men is
not attributed entirely to lack of
patriotism on the part of the re.
cruiing officers. One of the princi
ple handicaps seems to be the physi
cal defects of some kind. It is stated
that one recruiting officer went to
one of tire northern counties und by
earnest efforts obtained four recruits
who missed ft nhvsiral evnuiinntion
given by a doctor. Then they were
brought to Santa Ke and again ex
amined by a physrran who passed
three of the four, expressing doubt
about the fourth. Then the four
rec.r'iils were sent to Columbus,
where Uncle Gain's medical examin
ers rejected all four of them, despite
their long and expensive journey.
The vision of the men did not come
up to the government requirements:
otherwise they were tit.
Interesting Debute at Horn School
There will be a debate at the Horn
school bouse, formerly known as the
Hull school bouse, Sunday morning
July 2, at ten o'clock. The subject
is "Hesolved Secret Orders Are
Contrary to the Will of liod. And
Are Therefore Condemned by the
Scriptures." The affrmative will be
taken by F. S. Hyso jand J. H. Hop
kins will take the negative. Mr.
Hopkins' stand is to the effect that
the secret orders as conducted to
day are of benefit to the members
and the families of the members und
are therefore upbelj by the scrip
tures. J. It. Hopkins alllrms, F. S.
Hyso denies. The debate will pro
bably last four hours, from ten until
twelve, and two until four. A basket
' dinner will be served on the ground.

before the board with a request for
(further time in mos ing his shop from

was unanimously granted, the board
granting him a reasonable length of
time to find a suitable location, but
instructing him that the limitations
of thi' tire ordinance must be com

probably be the method adopted. It

He recommended that the wells, j
