ONE of the strong men of Utah ds Judge Itolapp. He began his fight for a name and place and
fortune in Utah when but a boy. He has made good every where and now in the prime of
life, with apparently many more years of work in him, is one of Utah's foremost
citizens. '
Henry Newman Rolapp, the son of Fritz and Anna Thiesen Rolapp, was born at Flensburg, Ger
many, March 22, 1860. His early education was gained in the grammar schools and Ralschule. In
1877 he removed to Liverpool, Eng., and spent three years in that city. In June, 1880, he left the
old world and came and made his home in Utah. He settled first in Salt Lake City.
He was admitted to the Utah bar in 1881 and three years later had bestowed upon him the L.
L. B. degree by the University of 'Michigan.
Back from that university Judge Rolapp took up the practice of law in Ogden.
On December 9, 1888, he was united in marriage with Martha Horricks. From 1885 to 1888 he
was assessor ami from 1887 to 1891 was assistant county attorney of Weber county.
He was cashier of the Utah Loan and Trust company from 1892 to 1895.
From 1888 to 189516 was a member of the State Board of Corrections and a supreme ,court jury
commissioner.
Judge Rolapp was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Utah territory in November, 1895,

board the Americans H
that had been in office H
there, then firing a H
farewell salute weighed H
anchor and sailed H
away, the ships' bands H

icthcr it was the H

made in dealing with a H
helpless people. H
There is not one edu- H

docs not know that '
not one acre of Mexi- jM
can soil is coveted by M
the United States, but 'JM
they do know that their H

They might have H

they, there would not H
have been an American H

recognized Carranza, iH
the meanest bandit of H
the bunch, and permit- H
ted war munitions to H
be sent him. H
If he gave the order H
under which the lesser H
bandit Gomez planned H
and carried out his H
murders, war cannot be H
avoided. . H
At this writing it I

must do by the present H

did by the McKinley H
administration, give it H
every support, and iH
must urge that tho H

enough to make the H
war a short one and H
decisive enough to con- H

business to awaken the 'H
wrath of the Great Re- H
