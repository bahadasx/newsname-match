The preparations;.
States for war Will
ward. There will,
of the rush of Natioi
the bordor, and Oen.^Funston will
continue disposing of his forces-as
though he expected an Immediate at?
tack.
The fact that Carranza has complied
with one of the demands is accepted
by the more optimistic officials here
as an indication that he is striving to
prevent a break. Even though he
again should attempt to throw all
blame for the Carrizai fight upon the
American officers and insist upon his
right forcibly to oppose any except
northward movements of American
troops, it is thought possible that he
will state his position In such a way
as to make further discussion nec?
essary..
During any negotiation., however,
the United States will ? Insist upon
freedom of movement of the troops in
Mexico, and any attempt to interfere
with them will be met by such force
as is necessary. This will apply, too,
to any period of delay occasioned by
attempts to arrange mediation or ar?
bitration.
The possibility of Latin-American
offers qf mediation in the crisis again
was widely discussed. Ignaclo Calder
on, minister from Bolivia, will call up?
on Secretary Lansing tomorrow to en?
deavor to ascertain whether a tender
of good offices would be entertained
at this time.
It Is known that powerful Influences
have been brought to bear on Car?
ranza In the past few days to make
him at least turn over the American
prisoners. Prominent Mexicans in the
United States as well as American
bankers and business interests with
Influence in Mexican affairs warned
the Bret chief that to hold the prison?
ers would mean war.
Secretary Baker waited at the war
department until late toniubt for a re?
port from Gen. Funston on Gen. Trevi?
no's announcement tbat be had sent
the cavalrymen to Juarez to bo set
free. He llnally went home without
the report.
President Wilson now expects to 1111
an engagement which he almost had
decided to cancel to address the As?

World in convention at Philadelphia
tomorrow afternoon, lie probably will
leave for Philadelphia at noon.

Itodgers at Mexico City, a messago
dated yesterday and received early to?
day, said he expected to be handed
the note today. He gave no Intlma
fltton of what might be its contents,

partment to a report just received
from the Mexican consul at El Paso
that a Mexican boy, accompanied by
his father on a train bound from
Douglas, Ariz., to El Paso, had been
beaten into insensibility yesterday by
two American soldiers and two civil?
ians who boarded the train at Ha
chlta, N. M. The consul represented
the boy had a toy pistol which ex?
cited suspicion.
The ambassador also let it be
known that he had asked his govern?
ment for information concerning a
report that American troops jhad
crossed the border pursuing bandits
near Hachlta yesterday.
There was a dearth cf border .ad?
vices at the war department today.
Nothing was received relating to any
Incident in Mexico which might be
the basis for charges contained in
Mr. Arredondo's note. The note will
be submitted to Gen. Punston so that
a report from Gen. Pershlng may be
obtained.
The department was almost swamp?
ed, however, by the accumulation of
detail work of getting 1<) 0*000 Na?
tional Guardsmen equipped/ and to
the border in the shortest possible
time. Reports to the quartermaster
general showed that the railroads
were meeting the unusual strain upon
their facilities in a highly satisfac?
tory manner.
From manufacturers also satisfac?
tory cooperation is being received
army officials reported. Secretary
Baker made public today a statement
from his supply division chiefs that
every need of the National Guard as
to clothing, equipment and food was
being met. It contained also the sig?
nificant statement that existing ar?
rangements would care for tho situa?
tion in that regard, no matter how
many troops might be called out. At
the department and in the great ? i
itary supply depots like Philadelphia,
St. Louis and San Francisco huge
shipments arc being hurried to the
State mobilization points in addition
to those rushed to the border in
preparation for the mobilization
along that 1,800 mile line of the larg?
est American army ever gathered in
such narrow compass since the closo
of the War Between tho Sections.
From the arsenals, trains laden with
Implements of war, rifles, artillery
and ammunition are moving swiftly.
Orders for additional machine guns
have been placed, making certain an
adequate supply.

For tomorrow: New Hampshire and
unitB from Massachusetts and Con?
necticut which are not already on
thela way. ?
For Thursday: Maine and Rhode
Island.
For Friday: One regiment of In?
fantry from Maryland.
Col. John B. Bellinger, department
quartermaster, asserted that the
troops were moving without difficulty.
Arrangements have been made, he
said, to provide sleeping cars for the
troops as fast as it is possible to col?
lect them at the various mobilization
points.
Col. Bellinger said that the troop
trains would make several stops dally
so as to permit the soldiers to exer?
cise. Difficulty in providing kitchen
cms has been remedied, the coolnel
added, by converting baggage curs
into cooking cars.
Announcement was made that, the
Twelfth regiment of infantry, New
York National Guard, probably would
depart for the border tomorow,
transportation facilities already hav?
ing been provided.
New orders were received from the
war department today, Gen. Wood
said, directing him to hasten the de?
parture, of cavalry units as that branch
of the service is more urgently needed
on the border than infantry. He was
ordered to send the men South as
soon as they are ready and provide
them with mounts at the border or
ship their horses to them later. t

committee of the two houses met
again and decided to strip the resolu?
tion of all points of controversy, in?
cluding the provision for relief of de?
pendent families of guardsmen, re?
turning it to the form In which it was
drawn originally at the war depart?
ment. In that form it passed the
house without a division. Tho senate
probably will adopt it tomorrow.
The resolution's greatest value, In
the eyes of army officials, it is au?
thorization to consolidate incomplete
organizations of the guard. Under
this power it will be possible to move
without delay every man who has
responded to the president's eall, ex?
cept those not physically qualified to
