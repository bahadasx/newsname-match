Order to Attack Americans
Moving South to Stick,
Decides Carranza
PULL WITHDRAWAL
OF FORCES URGED
Gravity of the Situation
Not Lessened By Release
of Captive Troopers
Washington, D. C., June SO.—Pri
vate advices reaching Washington
from a reliable source in Mexico City
today said Gen. Carranza and his ad
visers had determined to stand by or
ders of Gen. Trevino to attack Ameri
can troops in Mexico moving in any
direction except toward the border
and that no way was seen to avoid a
"break with the United States.
A faction of the Mexican cabinet,
It was said, was urging an even more
defiant attitude and wanted to include
In the reply to the American request
for a statement of intentions a new
'dein&Hd for immediate withdrawal of
all United States troops now on Mexi
can soli.
The advices did not indicate when
the response from Carranza might be
expected. The last word on the sub
ject to the state department came in
a message from Special Agent Rodg
ers who said he had expected the note
to be handed him Wednesday night.
When President Wilson met with
his cabinet today juBt before leaving
for New York to deliver an address,
the unfavorable private reports had
not, reached him.
Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican am
bassador designate, called on Mr. Lan
sing early in the day to communicate
Lansing made it plain that the Wash
ington government expected an early
reply to its note forwarded to Mexi
co City last Sunday.
All cabinet members agreed after
the meeting that both the situation
and the policy of the United States
were unchanged as a result of recent
developments.
Release of the captured troopers has
delayed military action but has not
relieved the critical diplomatic situ
ation now existing. Several reports
from Special Agent Rodgers referring
to refugees on routine matters did not
mention the Mexican note. He has
had no light to shed on the probable
course Gen. Carranza would take. It
is known, however, that Mexico City
interests which have been exerting
every effort to prevent a break are
much discouraged.
Should the Mexican reply be in de
fiance of the United States, however,
its meaning might be wrapped about
with diplomatic language, there Is no
indication that the government would
waver in its determination to protect
the border by military operations.
President Wilson probably would ar
range to lay the whole matter before
congress immediately.
TENSION 18 RELAXED.
El Paso, Texas, June -30. *—Tension
relaxed perceptibly today as a result of
the safe return of the American troop
ers taken prisoner in the Carrizal en
gagement.
In official circles in Juarez news dis
patches that the surrender of the negro
soldiers had averted possibility of im
mediate retaliatory steps by the Unit
ed States were received with obvious
satisfaction. Andres Garcia, Mexican
consul at El Paso, expressed the belief
that the first step looking toward a
peaceful solution of the border prob
lem had been taken.
At the request of Gen. George Bell,
Jr., commanding the El Paso military
district, Mr. Garcia today made prelim
ment, to^he United ^tetM^or burial,
dead are available, but the missing
number Is fifteen and it is believed all
were killed.

progress around Llnewka and Sokul.
The Germans made a violent attack
on Hill 304, northwest of Verdun, but
the French curtain of fire repulsed
them. Intense bombardments continue
northeast of Verdun.
Along their part of the front in
France and Belgium, the British are
bombarding German positions and
sending out raiding parties who have
Inflicted losses on the Germans and
have taken a number of prisoners.
In Trentino, the Austrians are re
treating before the Italians who have
recaptured important positions taken
from them in the recent Austrian of
fensive. The Italians also have start
ed a big offensive against the Aus
trians on the eastern front, around
Monte San Michele and San Martino.
They have been repulsed at some
points, according to Vienna.

tary unit which has been organised
here since the departure of Battery
for Camp Dodge may be mustered into
seryice within forty-eight hours.
While the sixty or more who have

REPEDTILCT
LFTW HELD VULIO
Des Moines, June 30.—The mulct
repeal law, which closed saloons in
Iowa January 1, 1916, Is valid and
constitutional, according to a decision
of the Iowa state supreme court In af
firming the case of the State vs. John
Hill, appellant.. The action was be
gun' in Davenport by three saloon
keepers to test the new law.
Tjjie court was unanimous in up
holding the mulct repeal law and' dis
missed the contention of the saloon
keepers in each Instance by stating
that "none of the points raised are
fairly debatable and we entertain no
doubt In finding the repealing statute
invulnerable to the objections inter
posed."
The decision was handed down late
yesterday. It Is believed the liquor
men will ask a rehearing.
CLEMENCY URGED
FOR CASEMENT
London, June 30.—The Manchester
Guardian, one of the most influential
papers in the country, makes a dire'et
plea for clemency for Sir Roger Case
ment.
While admitting that no other sen
tence but that of death could have
been pronounced by the court, the
Guardian says:
"Casement was a fanatic and his
crimes, like those of many other fan
atics, are free from the taint of sordid
ness and meanness. The death pen
alty will do nothing to kill such
dreams as his. Rather it will give
them life.
"For the sake of the new Ireland
which we hope to see it is a moment
for clemency."
An indirect plea for mercy is made
[by other papers.
