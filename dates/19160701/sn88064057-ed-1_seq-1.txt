I happened to meet a man not
long ago who was bewailing, the
fact that oneof his farm imp-l mncts
for which he had urgent need, \:iws
lying idle awaitin'g a new part that
had to be ordered "(,ut of town."
Reason? The implement in ques.
tion had been bought from a dis
tant house, and, not being a Stan
dard make, the local dealer wa.s
unable to supply a part to match
the broken one, which the local
blacksmith could not mend on ac
count of a "bad place in the metal"
Work dependent on the machine
had been held up three days. Ap
praisal of the time lost---according
to the owner's computation---a
mounted to approximately $ 20, to
say nothing of the inconvcnienuce
to which he was put.
Investigation on my part devel
oped the information that the own
er figured that he was saving about
$ 6,50 on the original purchase by
sending away for the implement.
The local merchant stoutly main
tained, however, that the difference
in price was fully represented in
quality.
In justice to all parties it should
be said that the broken part was

That your local merchants are
in position to render you more aind
better service than those at a dis
tanee there is no doubt. And ser
vice is an element worthy of much
consideration.
If you will demand Standard
goods of establihed worth you will
invariably be assurd of gettiug full
value for the amount of money ex
pended.
Establshing favorable reputation
and demand for any particular
brand of merchandise is an expen
sive process. As the expense in
curred cannot be added to selling
prices it must be absorbed by vol.
ume of sales--steady demand by
satisfied consumers.
You can buy Standard products
to as good advantage locally as any
where else, and your money spent
in your home stores will benefit
you and your neighbors in many
ways.
Eliminating the element of sen
timent, it is to your advantage,
from a financial standpoint, to
keep, in your community, as much
of the money produced there as!
possible

MEtaiAS IN TEXAS
WILL BE PROTECTED
Governor of Texas Issues Proclama
tion to Mexican Residents of State
to Remain Reutral.
.ust.<i, Tex. -- GCO rollor For.:u-ol
ohda. i -ui'.s a pr(klduation r1 t . lurl
prot c;lion of tii. :,t:ite provided they
rcittain n: ina al and do not par'ticii i':
in ;,::? denionttration or create a di -
turb:h~i e. The governor invites thu
co-operation of all law-abiding M'exi
cans inl keeping down any race hatred
and strife.
To Texas MIexicans: At this time I
want to say a word to citizens of Mex
lean parentage residing permanently
or temporarily in Texas.
The state of Texas demands of all
persons while in her borders absolute
obedience and respect to her laws and
constituted authorities.
If Texas Mexicans will aid by words
and deeds the various peace officers
in Texas to carry out this dnimand,
they need have no fear of bodily harm
and they will receive the protection of
our laws.
if they do not in some manner show
their loyalty to the state and nation
they will bri,;g trouble upon them
se!~s and nmany crimes will be com
m ti-d which can not be prevented.
There are thousands of Mexicans in
T. xa. emp:oye:i in many different oc
cupations. This employment will con
tilnue- o long as Mexicans remain loyal
to T. xas.
If thse :people were left alone there
woill be little cause for alarm with
the A rtr ricais.
lint, unfortunetely, the prejudice of
many Mexica-r, v:hilh micht other
tv'ie retlrain loy-:l to Texas, has been
arou.sed by bandit leaders from Mexico
and lealing of hatr' d exists alone our
Texa- borders, which should not be.
In the future when one of these ban
lit I,x:ic-cs from Mexico comes armo.
o andr. tries to tell you that the
tnrer;rcrans want to mistreat you, and
wants you to join some secret move
nt-it, report hinm at once to the first
officer you can get to. Report the
nrame: of other Mexicans who are mix
ed up in the gang. Show that you are
loyal to this country, and, as governor
of Texas, I guarantee that you will
be protected from all harm. In addi- 1
tion to this I will pay a very liberal re
ward in gold to any Mexican who will
furnish to the sheriffs and ranger cap
tains reliable information and names
of those who are seeking to arouse
the Mexicans of Texas to take up arms
against the Americans or to destroy
their property.
I earnestly invite the help and co
operation of all law-abiding Mexicans
in keeping down any race hatred and
strife. If you do not want to confer
with the officers, write me dirgct at
Austin.
But the better plan is for the good
Mexicans to get in close relation with;
the officers and show them that you
are loyal citizens, and there will be no
trouble in Texas.
I appeal to the Mexican press and
Mexican leaders to warn their people
against the strange Mexican who
comes to this country to stir up
trouble. By so doing you can render
a great service to your people, and
you will be the means of promoting
peace and good will between Texans
and Texas Mexicans.

Governor of Texas.

Texas leads in the rapidity of road
construction. The Jefferson Highway
crosses ten counties in the Lone Star
state. Of the ten enunties, egl\h have
voted a total of $3.500.000 hi bonds
during the past four months to take
care of tle highway. It is believed
that the etire stretch of 259 miles in
STexas will be built and hard surfaced
with in twelve montths.
Three separate routes are fighting
for the distinction of being included
in the Jefferson Highway between
Minneapolis. St. Paul and the Cana
dian boundary ling. In order to tie
termine upon the best route and give
all three routes equal opportunity,
the general manager of the Jefferson
Highway has decided to send a com
mittee of road experts over the roads
for inspection purposes. The route
that is shown to be in the best con
dition for traffic will be given the,
honor.
