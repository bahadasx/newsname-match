CASEMENT AFFAIR
(Ambassador to Tell British Gov
ernment of Great Interest
Here in S'r Roger's Fate.
Walter H. Page, United States am-
basador to Great Britain, will be in
structed to bring to the attention of
the British foreign minister, Informally
and as a matter of Information, the
tremendous (rarest in the United States
over the fateNpfBlr Roger Casement,
who has been sBTftcnced to death for
treason for his part in the Irish re
volt. This action has been taken as a result
of a flood of telegrams, petitions, and
memorials which have reached tho
White House urging the President to
try to save tho life of Casement..
These requests have come not only
from Irish-American organisations but
from private Individuals In all walk's of
life.
It Is pointed out In Administration
circles that under no circumstances
would the United States Government
have any grounds upon whloh to lodge
a formal protest against the execution
of the Irish 'elader, or even make for
mal representations In behalf of clem
ency. It a felt, however, that It Is entirely
proper to proceed along the lines laid
down In the Instructions to Ambassador
Page.
Senator Martina of New Jersey has
Introduced In the Senate a resolution
calling on the President and State De-
Sartment to lodge a protest with the
rtUsh government 'against the execu
tion. The resolution was referred 'to the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
where, at the suggestion of the Admin
UtraUon, It wlU probaiy remain.
Militia Is Stricter Than
Insurance Companies
To guard against unduly swelling
the periston lists In years to come.
tho War Department ahs ordernd
examining officers to make tho
strictest tests of every militiaman.
The examination follows closely
the lines of life Insurance tests,
though where a man might get an
Insurance policy when either over
or under weight, the same man
would bo rejected bv the mllltla or
the army.
In brief, the qualifications are that
tho soldier must have good cye
sight, sound hearing, reasonably
food teeth, and entirely sound heart,
ungs. and other vital organs. Ills
general physical condition must be
good, and his 'chest expansion muH
conform1 to a set standard, which Is
proportioned to his height.
The war Department denied today
that minor defects can be waived.

10,000 Militiamen Due
At Fort Bliss Today
EL PASO, Tex., July 1. Today a
tented city which will house thou
sands of militiamen Is springing Into
life on the cactus-decked plain near
Fort Bliss.
Before the end of he coming week
there will be an army of 26,000 na
tional guardsmen stretching from El
Pasoto Columbus, N, M.
They will gradually assume the
patrol duties of over 6,000 regulars,
who can be rushed Into Mexico to
Join General Pershing's columns.
Local authorities believed the for
eign office statement issued in Mex
ico City yosterday might lead to the
punitive expedition being re-enforced.
While the militia's advance on the
border is screened by an official
silence. 10,000 men from Pennsylvania
and New Jersey Is the vanguard ex-
gected here today. Regulars at Fort
llss were hard at work this morning,
clearing the new camp sites of
mosquito and cactus.
"I can give no Information regarding
troop-movements," General Bell stated.
"I have received Instructions from
Washington to this effect But we ex
pect the advance guard of the militia
men some time today and others are en
route."
The regulars relieved ny tne arrival
of the National Guard will be held In
momentary readiness for a dash Into
Mexico, ir necessary, with tne e.uw
regulars from the El Paso sone, General
Pershing would have a punltlvo force of
about 17.000 men. The latest estimate
of the American army now In Mexico
Is about 11,000 men.
Even .thus ro-enforecd. Pershing will
have only a third of the number the

to have laid their plans for a quick blow

OFFICIALS H ER E SAY
I President Eagerly Awaits Reply to Latest De
mands on De Facto Government ; De
cision of U. S. Now Rests With First
Chief ; Mexico City Hostile.
Upon Carranza's attitude as outlined in the eagerly
awaited reply to President Wilson's latest demands rests the
decision between peace and war.
If the statement issued by the foreign minister yester
day is a forecast of the reply, officials take a gloomy view.
In many quarters it is believed this was issued for home
consumption and that Carranza will not adopt an attitude of
defiance that will prohibit the possibility of a peaceful set
tlement. Special Agent Rodgers telegraphed the State Depart
ment today he had no information as to when Carranza's
reply to the American demands is to be delivered to him. He
had expected to receive the reply last Wednesday.
The Mexican government did not deliver to Mr. Rod
gers a copy of the defiant statement issued yesterday by
Foreign Minister Agujlar. r.
It. wjs assumed tluVstatement was Intended as an anr
swer to the American note of June 2Cs out if it was sain-""
tended, it has not been officially presented to this Govern
ment. Press dispatches from Mexico City indicate that all of
Mexico is in favor of the defiant attitude represented in the
statement of the foreign minister.
The President made it clear in his speech last night be
fore the New York Press Club that only as a last resort will
the United States resort to hostilities.
The demands of this Government upon Carranza for
a nexplanation of his dead-line order were published today
for the first time in the Mexican capital.
Interpolated in the American demands were specizc
answers to the various charges, all of them placnig the
blame upon this Government.
The charge is made openly that Captain Boyd was re
sponsible for the battle at Carrizal . The Mexican officers
participating have been promoted for gallantry, it is added.
Further massing of Carranza troops against Pershing's
columns in overwhelming numbers are reported in border
dispatches. All information of Mexican troop movements
have been forwarded to Pershing by radio.
Thousands of militiamen are arriving at border points
and within a few hours part, at least, of the 30,000 regulars
doing border patrol will be released for service.

I
MEXICO CITY, July l.-Th Mexico
City newspapers today vigorously ap
proved the t-tatement given out by For
eign Bccrctnry Agullar yesterday, com
menting upon and refuting assertions In
the American note.
The foreign office statement was pub
lished In tho same editions with the
Amerlcnn note, which was thus given to
the public for the first time.
The newspapers printed first a para
graph of President Wilson's communi
cation, and then Inserted a paragraph
of Agullar's reply, answering that par
ticular charce.
Officials said today that the tone of
Agullar's statement was fully justified
because of the tone of the American
note.
Thev complained that the United
States has sent several extremely sharp
and undiplomatic messages to the Mexi
can government and said that they had
withheld publication cr many or tneso
communications because they did not
wish to stir up hostility to the United
States.
The foreign office announced today
that Immediately upon receipt of Infor

Issued fresh warning for Americans to
