EIGHT PAQE8 LOGAN, CACHE COUNTY. UTAH SATURDAY JULY 1 1910 FOURTEENTH YEAR Ifl
CONTROVERSY
, OVER CAPTAIN
ILLjADVISED
Governor' Selection of Mr. Woolley
a; Wist One. A Man the Logan
Boya Will All Like
' Thero has been an attitude among
t, a few of the citizens of Logan dur
ing tbo last day or two to criticise
the governor In appointing Colonel
E. O. Woolley as captain of the Lo
gan troop on the ground that Mr,
Woolloy Is a stranger In Logan and
Cache Valley and that the boys are
not acquainted with him,
As a matter of fact Mr. Woollov
Is fairly well known In the northern
part of Cache Valley and especially
at Richmond whore he owns and has
built up during the last three years,
with his family, one of the finest
dairy farms in this valley. Mr. Wool
ley's family xrosIdes at the present
time at Richmond, and has dono so
for tho last two or three years.
If any one In Logan doubts the in
tegrity, the ability, or the publla
splrltedness or the citizenship of
Captain Woolley, let him call up or
communicate with Senator J. W
Funk, or Mr. J. W. Hendricks, or
Mr. C. Z. Harris or any other pro
gressive citizen of Richmond and he
will no doubt get an unbiased opin
ion of whom Captain Woolley is and
what he stands for.
Mr. Woolley spends his week days
as the manager of tho largest brok
erage flrin in Salt Lake City, but his
Sunday's are always spent with his
family at Richmond, At tho tirao cf
the Spanish American war, he enlist
ed and did service.
As soon as It becamo known that
the Utah troops would be requested
to get ready to movo, Mr. Woolley
went to tho governor and volunteer
ed his services for nny position
which tho governor saw fit to givo
It him, whether It bo that of captain
or prlvato and It was at tho govor.
nor's solicitation entirely that Mr.
Woolley was Induced to act as Cn
tain of Troop H.
Mr. Woolley offered his services
because of his patriotism. Ho felt
that since he had been wearing tho
uniform on dress parade as a mem
ber of the governor's staff in time of
peace that it was his duty as an
American citizen to offer himself
for actlvo servlco In time of war.
This he did with extreme' modesty,
yet with keen determination, not
withstanding the fact that his sacri
fice will bo as great us that of any
other citizen of Utah who is enlist
ing. Wo, therefore, feel that In Justice
to Mr. Woolley and the governor of
Utah, that an acquaintanceship at
least, is due between tho boys of
Troop II. and Captain Woolley be
fore a Just criticism can como from
uny citizen of Logan,
As to Edmund Spencer, wo agreo
that Logan City, o r the State of
Utah or tho United States of Ameri
ca has no cleaner cut, straightfor
ward, energetic or loyal citizen. His
career has been admirable, his ad
vancement in tho forestry service is
praiseworthy and merited. His ad
vancement has como through his am
bition and his push and thero Is no
one who doubts his ultimate success,
but from tho fact that ho has had
no military training and Is atlll a
" young man, is ho not doing excep
tionally well when ho gets tho ap
pointment of first lieutenant of
Troop H7 Ed, himself certainly
thinks so. And wo think bo.
Reese Howell, ono of Logan's
young sons, who completed a four
year courso at West Point two years
ago and who has had two years of
nctlvo sorvlco In tho army, Iibb .Ju'tt,
been appointed first lieutenant anil
he and his whqlo family are delight
ed with tbo promotion. And hla
growth has certainly been as rapid
as that of any of the young army of
fleers. Citizens of Logan lot us all hopo
that ovory membor of Troop H. will
bo promoted just as fast as ho mer
its it. We havo some of the finest
blood and somo of our finest young
men In this troop. It would be against
.all prostlgo If every ne f tnesa
young men does not glvo a good nc
count of himself. Tho occasion of
their leaving warrants tho putting
J aside of nil political or othor differ
ences and demands a united Logan
in winning the boys God's speed and
a safe return.

DDES PRESIDENT
WILSON WANT
TOSEEWAR?
Does President Wilson want war?
The Salt Lake Tribune Intimates
that ho does In the following pithy
paragraph:
"Carranza has been truculent and
defiant because of the pacldstlc ten
dencles at Washington. It Is Impos
sible to believe that ho docs not re
alize tho power of tho United States.
Ho can foresee tho ultimate fate of
Moxlco In a war with the United
States as clearly as If that fato nl
ready wero realized, but ho has been
stubborn and unyielding because ho
has cherished the notion that Amer
ica would not fight because most of
tho American people did not wish to
fight.
"By this tlmo ho has been unde
ceived. In the last few days he has
seen a complete reversal of form,
so to speak, on tho part of tho Uni
ted States. The president, after
years of delay, has been seeking ex
pedients to forco a war. Ho would
bo greatly disappointed now nnd
wo say this In splto of the peaceful
mountings of tho Democratic plat
form If Carranza wero to submit to
all tho terms of tho recent ultimat
um. Tho president fully understands
tho political value of a war for tho
administration In power, especially
If tho war be Just. And In tho last
few days tho president has dlvostod
himself of tho trappings of peaco
and has blossomed forth In the full
panoply of war.
"Wo nro not condemning him for
forcing tho Issue. Wo aro trying
merely to doscrlbo tho present situ
ation In its truo colors.

Stamped paper for wall decoration
was first mado In Spain or nolland or
simultaneously In both countries, about
1555, For somo reason this earliest
form of wall paper was succeeded by
wall hangings of veliet and floss about
1020, About a century litter paper camo
