Tax Rate Will Not Be Fixed
Until Late in the
Month.
All of the county officials who are
required to make a report at the
close of the fiscal year ending today
are buBily engaged in their computa
tions and it will likely be July 10
before the sheriff can make his tfe
port to the county court.
The sheriff Is compelled to wait
until the county superintendent of
schools and the assessor have turned
in to him their reports. The county
superintendent of schools has about
completed his work for the Bheriff
and 1b now engaged in his report to
the state superintendent of schools.
Assessor Davis reports that there
are still many taxpayers who have
failed to return their list of assessa
ble personal property as required by
law. The "penalties for failure to do
this before the first of July are se
vere and under the acta of legisla
ture of 1915, chapter 79, section 73,
the taxpayer is liable to a forfeit of '
ten per cent of the property of which
he failed to return a list to the as
sessor. At the option of the assessor
the amount of the taxation of the
previous year may be doubled and
assessed as-the levy for this year.
July 3 ? is the date set for the
equalization board of this county to
meet to hear any complaints that
may be made in regard to the assess
ment of property. This board is com
posed of Howard Furbee, George W.
Mlllan and Eldridge Carter. Com
plaints have been rare in former
years and it is likely that this board
will complete the work and approve
the assessor's report In one or two
days. The assessor's report will then
bo ready for the sheriff and the coun
ty court, who #111 be able to deter
mine the amount of the levy for the
present fiscal year of 1916-17 some
time the latter part of this month.
The county court will meet in reg
ular seuion Monday. It is possible
that the matter of issuing the Lin
coln district road bonds will be
brought up. The attorneys wlio. rep
resent the citixena of that district in
sharp Indian scraps. Alter tho war
he went to the Philippines, where he
quelietl the murderous Moros, wreck
ed their 40 forts, and then treated them
eo well they made him a "datto," the
highest honor the Moros can bestow.
Pershing's work in the Philippines
won President Roosevelt's admiration
and he jumped "Black Jack" over the
heads of scores of other ranking offi
cers into a brigadier general's saddle.
their protest against the result of
the bond election have done nothing
since the county court refused to
grant a contest of the vote. It is
now up to the court to make the
next move, say the attorneys. Jiret
what they will do if the court orders
the issuing of the bonds they have
not said.

buted free one week from today.

you shall receive free a vote certifi
cate enUtllng you to forty-five thou

Artillery Preparations, Most Inter

paralleled Havoc
People of London Wildly Excited Over the Engageme
And Particulars are Eagerly Awaited?Gains
Along Twenty Miles. ^
Long Preparation
For the Attack
LONDON, July 1.?After weeks of
intense bombardment with guns of
every calibre, firing a billion shells
daily, the British early today launch
ed a general offensive against the
German line along a front of 20
miles north of the Somme.
They succeeded in taking the Ger
man front line trenches and captur
ing many men. The French on the
Brltsh right cooperated in the at
tack. When the last dispatches re
ceived thus far left the British head
quarters, the fighting was still pro
gressing and further successes, it
was reported, were being recorded.
The front selected for the British
offensive was decided on many weeks
ago and the bombardment of the rest
of the lines as well as frequent raids,
which procured for British head
quarters important information as to
the disposition of the Germans, was
designed to keep the German gener
als uncertain as to the point at which
they would be called on to meet the
brunt of attack.
This Is the first time since the out
break of war that the intention of
an army to undertake an offensive
has been so well advertised. A week
ago when the German attack against
Verdun began to make further head
way and it was feared the army of
the Crown Prince was getting within
a distance of Verdun which was dan
gerous for the allies, the British guns
began to speak. Since then, except
for the hours when British infantry
men were raiding German trenches,
a continual bombardment has been
maintained. ?
Batteries, which are now innumer
able, took turns at smashing the Ger
man defensives, destroying commun
ication trenches and blowing up am
munition depots. New trench mo
tors, particularly destructive, tore
away wire entanglements, broke
down parapets and generally opened
the way for men with rifles and bay
onets. " Big guns of 15 Inch and oth
er large calibres prevented the Ger
mans from bringing up support,
wrecking every thing within range.
The artillery Are was particularly In
tense on the stretch of front north
of the Somme and earlier dispatches
told of the destruction of the towns
of Thiepval, and . Beaucourtr whero ,
the Germans had concentrated am
munition.
Early -this morning more guns
were brought into action on this 20
mile sector and for an hour and a.i
half the Germans were subjected to
a bombardment which Is described
as the fiercest experienced in tbla
was of heavy artillery. i
.The news of the British offensive,
which was quickly circulated in Lon- i
don, created the greatest enthusiasm i
and details of the battle are
anxiously-awaited. Only thls*inor[
ing the correspondents at the front1
for British newspapers while writing;
of the British artillery and successe
warned the public that an adv&nc
must be made by infantry and nc"
artillery, and that the British^!
could not expect tp. come out ?
