London, July 1. The supreme of

his morning, with one of the greatest
Xnglo-French gains on the western
'ront since the German retreat from
.he gates of Paris.
Two hours after the British troops
drove forward they had captured six
teen miles of German forward
trenches north of the Somme, the war
offii:e announced in a brief bulletin.
French troops, on the British right,
struck at the same hour. The Brit
ish war office announced that the
French made equally satisfactory
gains, leaving to General JorTre the
honor of announcing the full extent
of the French successes. No state
ment had come from the French war
office early today, but it was believed
a full report on the French gains
would be made before night.
The British attack was made on a
wtnty mile front north of the Somme

jombardments the world has ever
Known. With German advanced
trenches firmly held, the British were
pressing forward to the attack at 9 30

said the battle was proceeding with
the utmost violence on both the British

Half an hour after reveille had sound

and thrown over the shoulders of
the infantrymen. Huge bonfires
were built and aided the rising sun

Fivo minutes more and 1,007 en
listed men were in line. The total
strength of tho Second regiment had
been 1,212, but 165 men were dis
qualified as a result of the physical
examinations.
A few minutes and the Second
Regiment band had struck
A Hot Time" and marched
to the railroad tracks. The
band was followed by the mount

they could make connections to New

Considerable delay was occasioned
awaiting official orders from Capt. L.
R. Holbrook, post quartermaster.
Meantime the remaining companies of
the Second regiment stacked arms and
waited impatiently.
A he companies from the First regi
ment drilled, charged at the train, fell i
and pointed guns at the men in the
first section.
At 8:35 o'clock the first section
pulled out. There were only a few
women at the train.
Little was seen of the men of Bat

Shortly after a reveille the artillery
men began taking a collection to pur

has been detailed to return to Topeka

Band Plays Hot Time.
On Board First Section, First In

the band again struck up "A Hot
Time." Cheer after cheer was given
by the other companies waiting their
turn to entrain. Even then there was
no intimation as to the intermediate
points that thi train would pass
through on its way through Kansas.
William Curtis, in charge of the
special trains, stated that the govern
ment had ordered the routings should
not be given out.
"We have hundreds of Mexicans
working on the sections," said Mr.
Curtis, "and there is no telling what
they will do. Then, too, the govern
ment wants the troops hurried to the
border and not delayed by cheering
crowds at the depots."
Finally those who desired to get off
at Topeka were assured the train
wouid go through there.
The men in the Second Regiment
band rode in the next to the last car,
right next to the Pullman occupied by
Colonel Hoisington and other commis

David W. Smith, who failed to pass the

Disregard Terrific Losses to
Sweep Germans From France.
London, July 1. This iB the first
time since the outbreak of the war
that the intentions of an army to un
dertake an offensive have been so well
advertised. A week ago when the Ger
man attacks against Verdun began to
make further headway and it was
feared the army of the crown prince
was getting within a distance of Ver
dun which was dangerous for the al
lies, the British guns began to speak.
Since then except for the hours when
British infantry men were raiding
German trenches, a continual bom
bardment has been maintained.
Batteries which now are innumer-
able took turns at smashing the Ger-
man defenses, destroying communica
tion trenches and blowing up ammuni
tion depots.
The tremendous offensive which has
been launched by the British army
on the German front is the culmina
tion of a five day battle which in the
amount of ammunition expended and
in the territory Involved exceeds, any
thing of the kind that has becrf pre
viously known in the world war.
Two Million Men Ready.
For some weeks reports have been
current in England and France that
"big push" of the British was about
to commence. It was stated that Eng
land had 2,000.000 men fully equipped
and trained in. preparation Cor the su
preme effort to break the German
lines. More than 1,000.000 shells are
declared to have been fired daily in
the preliminary bombardment which
extended over a front ninety miles in
length. '
The menace of the British attack
was fully appreciated in Germany, ac
cording to newspaper comments from
Berlin and the utmost confidence was
expressed in the ability of the Ger
mans to meet and crush it. The allies
are now on the offensive in practically
every field of war.
The British assault comes on the
heels of the great successes won by

and
Enraged by the story of an attack
upon Mrs. W. H. Holston, an invalid,
45 years old, scores of men are search
ing for an unknown man four miles
southeast of Topeka this afternoon.
The attack was made this morning.
After having her wrists and ankles
bound by baling wire which the as
sailant had prepared in proper lengths
in advance Mrs. Holston escaped un
injured, with the exception of a ner
vous breakdown because, it is thought,
the man was frightened away by her
screams which attracted her husband.
Mrs. Holston was sitting in her
home, four miles southeast of Topeka,
at 10:30 o'clock this morning. She
heard a hen cackling in the barn. Al
though she is partially paralyzed on
one side and she has been ill for more
than a year, she limped to the barn,
thinking to find a hidden hen's nest.
She entered the barn and stood in the
driveway. Something, dropped behind
; her. She thought it was a cat and
gave it no attention. Some one seized
her from behind by both arms. It was
a man. He took a piece of baling
wire, and despite her weak efforts to
: resist and her stifled screams, he
I bound it around her wrists, the wire
! making ugly marks on her skin.
She Kicked Him.
I Mrs. Holston began to kick at her
j assailant.
1 "I'll fix you," he snarled,
'
her feet and started to bind her ankles
together with more baling wire.
She screamed again and again.
He hesitated, started for the door.
stopped and then ran toward a strip of
woods.
Mrs. Holton s husband who was
i working in the field, not far away,
heard her last scream which was loud
i er tnan the firBt and ran to the bara
( He found her lying on the floor. It
, was ten or fifteen minutes before she
could tell him what had happened. He
! carried her outside the barn where
' ghe fainted
Holston revived her and telephoned
! the sheriff. A call for miles to the
' north, east, south and west was sent
over the telephone and in a few min
utes Hugh Larimer, undersheriff, and
many neighbors were on the scene
organizing for a man hunt.
Talk of Lynching.
There was talk of lynching. The
faces of the men were angry and
excited.
"Can we ehoot him if we catch
him?" one man asked Larimer.
Larimer warned the men against
mob revenge and the hunt started.
It was evident. Larimer found when
he investigated in the hay mow. from
where the man dropped, the assailant
had planned his attack. A piece of a
sandwich and a gray woolen sock were
found in the mow. The wire which the
man usea naa been cut the proper
j length to bind a person's feet and
wrists.
The man was described by Mrs.
Holston as being of medium size. He
had a week's growth of beard on his
face. He wore a ring on one finger
and wore overalls.
Late this afternoon he had not been
captured. Larimer was still leading
