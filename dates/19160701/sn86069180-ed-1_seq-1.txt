Revolt.

'Making Powerful Plea
to Jury.
MAKris PLEA OF NOT GUILTY
Sir Roger Casement was on Thurs
day found guilty of the charge of
high treason In connection with the
rodent Irish rebellion. The jury
was out a little over an hour. Ho
was sentenced to death. Sir Roger
received the sentence with the ut
most composure, smiling at friends
in the court room. His statement,
which occupied a half hour, was a
plea for the right to bo tried by
Irish men and for Irish nationality.
Sir Roger Casement, chief in the
Sinn Fein revolt in lreiana, on
Mondav faced trial for his life on
a charco of hlch treason In the
High Court of Justice in London.
Up to the very moment of the
opening of tho trial no Indication
was given by his counsel as to
what would be the nature of the
accused man's defense. Francis R.
Doyle, of Philadelphia, who has
been retained by Casement's fam
ily, refused to say anything beyond
denying a report that his client
would throw himself on the mercy
of the Government.
At 10:30 o'clock a clerk in the
court of the Lord Chief Justice
called out: "The King versus Sir
Roger, Casement," and tho trial of
the. knight who Is accused of hav
ing Instituted tho Irish rebellion
was under way. Sir Roger bowed
to the Justices and tho Chief Jus
tice returned the salutation with
equal formality. The prisoner
stood leaning on the iron railing
with folded arms while the clerk
read the long indictment. When
asked If he -were guilty or not
culltv Sir Roger bowed and mur
mured something which was In
audible. His chief counsel, Alex-
S8
ment set forth was "no
oirenso
known to the law" and that none
of tho acts specified was alleged to
have taken place In any territory
over which tho King' has any
jurisdiction. After consultation the
court ruled that any exceptions to
the indictment in a case of such
importance could bo taken after tho
hearing without prejudice to the
prisonor. Then Sir Roger made a
formal plea of not guilty, speaking
in firm tones. Jurors from the ,
panel were tnen cauea iorwara. ai
11:10 o'clock tho jury was com-!
pleted. Tho jury Is composed of
middle-aged men, apparently of the
Small merchant and clerk class. The
jury was sworn throe-quarters of
an hour after the court sat.
.Dramatic developments took place
at Wednesday's session of the trial
of Sir Roger Casement for high
treason. Chief among these was a
statement in his own defense, which
Sir Roger made from tho dock. Sir
Roger said:
"Money was offered to me in
Germany more than once, and
offered liberally and unconditionally,
but I rejected every suggestion of
the kind and I left Germany a
poorer man than when I entered it.
Money I could always obtain from
my ovx countrymen, and I am not
ashamed here to acknowledge the
debt of gratitude I owe to many an
Irish friend and sympathizer who
did freely and gladly help me
when I was on the continent. I
trust I havo made the statement
clearly and emphatically enough for
all men, even my" bitterest onomies,
to comprehend that a man who
In the newspapers is 'Just another
Irish traitor' may be a gentleman.
Tho Attorney General of England
thought It consistent with tho tradi
tions of which ho is tho public rep
resentative to make a thinly veiled
allusion in his opening address to
the rising ln Ireland of which he
brought forward no evidence in hs
case from first to last, and from
which therefore you and I, gentle
men. aB laymen would havo sup
posed that ho would scrupulously
refrain from mentioning.' since tne
rising has been mentioned, however,
I must say categorically that tho
rebellion was not made in Germany,
that it was not directed from Ger
many, that it was not inspired from
Germany, and that not one penny of
German gold went to finance or as
sist it
"Gentlemen. I havo touched on
these personal matters, because I
Intended as they were to reflect on
my honor, they were calculated to
tarnish tho cause I hold so dear."
As Sir Roger made tho declara
tion that he never had accepted
German gold his voice trembled
with emotion and he leaned toward
the Jury as though supplicating the ' AIoysluB Schulten, a member of
jurora to believe his statement. I Company E, First Kentucky In
"As to my pension and the honor fantry. Rev. Father Jansen, the

refute. First, I never at any time and granted leave to Schulten, upon

era front. Second, I never asked an
Irishman to fight for Germany. I
have always claimed that he has no
right to fight for any land but Ire
land. Third, the horrible insinua
tions that I got my own people's
rations reduced to the starvation
point becauso they did not join the
Irish brigade is an abominable false
hood. The rattohB were necessarily
reduced throughout Germany owing
to the blockade, and they were re
duced for the Irish prisoners at ex
actly the same time and to the same
extent as for the German soldiers
and the entire population of Ger
many. The other suggestion that
my men were sent to punishment
camps at my instance for not join
ing the Irish brigade is one that I
need hardly pause to refute. It is
devoid of all foundation.
"Fourth, gentlemen, there Is the
widespread imputation of 'German
gold.' I owe it to those in Ireland
who arc assailed with me on this
very ground to nail the lie once
and for all. It was published by
newspapers in America, I think or
iginating in this country, and I
cabled to America instructing my
American lawyer, Mr. Doyle, to pro
ceed against those papers for libel.
Those who know mo know tho in
credibility of this malicious inven
tion, for they know from all my
past records that I have never sold
myself to any man or any Govern
ment and have never allowed any
Government to use me. From, the
first moment that I landed on the
continent until I came home again
to Ireland I never asked or received
a single penny of foreign money,
either for myself or for any Irish
cause or for any purposes whatso
ever." Immediately after the prisoner
had finished speaking Sergt. Sulli
van rose and began an eloquent ad
dress in summing up. Tho attorney
said the charge against Sir Roger
was that he had aided Germany
during the war. He declared that
Sir Roger was recruiting men for
service in Ireland after tho Euro
pean war had ended and that there
was no idea of giving aid to Ger
many. Sir Roger, he said, never
had asked Irishmen to fight for
Germany and not one atom of aid
had been rendered to Germany.
Sergt. Sullivan asserted the plan
was that an Irish brigade was to
be quartered In Germany until after
the war. If Germany was success
ful the brigade was to proceed to
Ireland to strike a blow for home
rule. If Germany lost the brigade
was to be sent to America.
Wednesday's session of the trial
was brought to a sudden and
dramatic close. While summing up
for the defense Mr. Sullivan col
lapsed as he was in the midst of
an impassioned appeal, and tho
court adjourned until Thursday
morning. .

bons, who wore present at different
sessions, many other church dig
nitaries were in attendance, thus
lending their support to a move
ment which has at heart the closest
and most vital Interests of the

forts in the early days were such
a strong factor ln the growth and
stability of tho organization.
Nearly all the delegates had

ORPHAN PJQNIC.
The last meeUng before tho
Fourth of July orphans' picnic was
held Monday night, and the enor
mous crowd that gathered to take
part in the important work of the
evening taxed the Knights of
Columbus Hall tapts utmost capac
ity. Enthusiasm'.. &84I good spirit
prevailed and every one predicted a
great success, i&ll.parlshcs with

Inspiring addresses were deliv
ered by Rev. T. L. Crowley, O. P.,
pastor of St. Louis Bertrnnd's, and
Rev. J. T. Hill, pastor of St. Ann's
church. "You are trying to let
moro sunshine Into the lives of the
orphans," said Father Crowley. "It
Is a noble work. You are striving
to give these children a chance jto
enjoy the same things you enjoy.
Your efforts In this society have
been a source of emulation to me.
I have been surprised at the won
derful organization in charge of tho
picnic. I am proud of tho fact that
our branch has been the banner one
In the city, but we will promise to
do even more ln the future."
Father Hill said: "You are now
almost at the goal, and you are
working hard, running fast; but if
there is one thought I would im
press upon you it is this: Do your
work not only for the orphans, but
for God. In doing it for God you
will thereby do more for the or
phans. I know you are doing it for
that Intention, but It is simply a
reminder. On one occasion when
our Lord was speaking on a' most
profound subject his apostles were
trying to put the children asido
until He finished, but He- said, 'For
bid them not, for of such is the
kingdom of heaven.' He loved them
to climb upon his knee and put
their little arms around his neck.
Doing your work for tho Lord
Jesus Christ, who loves little chil
dren so much, I am sure you can
not but succeed, and we will pray
for tho success of your labors."
Numerous donations were report
ed from all tho committees Monday
evening. The donors will be thanked
after the picnic in letters sent by
the proper officers of the society,
and their names and donations pub
lished. Some committees have al
ready secured as much as $150
from their work.
Miss Elizabeth Hayes, for the
Junior Circle of the Queen's Daugh
ters, stated that in the afternoon
there will be a May polo dance and
songs by tho little girls of St.
Vincent's. This together with the
drilling of the boys under the direc
tion of A. J. Chappell will be Inter
esting features of the day.
The gates will open at 9 o'clock
ln tho morning and remain open
until 11 o'clopk at night. The
grounds are spacious and shady and
plenty of benches will be afforded
for the crowd, so that they may
remain all day, it desired, and their
stay made pleasant and comfortable.
Parents are requested to bring their
little children along as amusements
will be furnished for their enter
tainment and pleasure. Tickets of
admission are twenty-five cents and
children under fourteen will be ad
mitted free. There will be music
by an excellent band, and no one
need bring any lunch to the
grounds, for .the Chairman of the
Dairy Lunch Committee believes he
will 'have sufficient to feed the
whole city of Louisville and at -a

candidacy of Hughes, and as they
realize more and moro how basely
they were deserted by their former
idol the feeling against him is as
pronounced as the self-humiliation.
It goes against the grain of the av
erage man most strongly to realize
that he has been buncoed or flim
flammed, and the spectacle of the
Progressives left high and dry in
convention at Chicago holding the
bag can not easily be forgotten. The
delegates and Progressive supporters
at Chicago were placed ln tho same
attitude as the disappointed bride
"waiting at the church," and tho
little bulletins sent from time to
time by Roosevelt while ho was
hoping against hope to stampede
the Republican convention were but
cold comfort for his blind followers
who had never been able to size
him up for his true value. March
ing through the blinding rain, put
ting up with the discomforts of
crowded hotels at enormous ex
pense, while Roosevelt was planning
to desert them, Is a picture that
they will not easily forget and no
glossing over by the hired orators
will convince them otherwise than
-that Teddy played them for suckers
and each Individual believes that
he played the chief sucker role.
From different parts of tho coun
try comes the statement that this
and that body of Progressives will
not follow Roosevelt's dictation as
to the support of Hughes, and then
again many of the Republican lead
ers are beginning to believe that
the Republican nominee is not of
the type that will' stir up en
thusiasm. His nomination was not
popular with the convention dele
gates, writers and political critics
agreeing that the announcement of
his victory received the coldest re
ception In convention history. The
statements he has Issued thus far
in regard to Americanism and pre
paredness are of the stereotyped
kind and do not have the true pa
triotic ring to them. It remains
to see if the great American people
will vote for a man of the cold
sphinx-like type; it is a certainty
that they will hardly inconvenience
themselves to .hear his addresses, as
the announcement of a speech by the
Republican nominee in any town or
vicinity in the country juBt now
would not bring together tho en
thusiastic gatherings that are char
acteristic of political campaigns.
Wilson will provo the most popular
figure of the two, and If it hadn't
been tor his anti-German policy and
mistaken policy in Mexico it would
not be hard to predict tho outcome.
As It is there is a doubt.
Hero in Louisville the situation
from the Republican-Progressive
standpoint Is pretty muddled. Bur
ton Vance, the local Bull Mooso
leader, returned from Chicago far
from being satisfied, and his fol
lowers may bo a disturbing element
in the Congressional race. There
are four in the field for the Repub
lican nomination, Dr. Ben Bruner,
Major W & Owens, Frank Falr
lelgh and Dr. Lewis Ryan. Dr.
Bruner win receive some or tne
Progressive; support and several of
the Men's Federation leaders help
because of his' prohibition views.
Major Owens wilL have, no certain
backing, but will depend upon his
ability as a campaigner for success.
Frank Falrlelgh will have the sup
port of the Chltlon-Searcy machine.
which just now controls Republican
politics absolutely. Falrlelgh was
selected as a substitute for Judge
DuRelle, who was supposed to en
ter the race, but it is rumored that
his defeat for the samo offlco sev
eral years ago made him gun-shy
and young Falrlelgh has nothing to
lose and all to gain. The fourth
starter, Dr. Lewis Ryans, is far arid
away the strongest man in tho race,
having the solid support of tho col
ored voters, and in addition "Doc"
is a good fellow with lots of friends ;
throughout tho district. The Chil
ton-Searcy machine will havo to be
at its best to beat him Is the opin
ion of political students.
Representative Will Perry will be
a candidate to succeed Senator Sam
Robertson in the Thirty-eighth dis

to tho Democratic nomination 'with

ln tho general election by Theodore

Diehl ln his race, this being in line
with his policy to have his former,
supporters obtain a foothold in the

EXCLUDES ULSTER COUNTIES.
A Nationalist convention of
representatives from tho six coun
ties of Ulster which would be ex
cluded from tho operation of home
rule for tho period of the war un
der the plan of David Lloyd-Georgo
met at Belfast on Friday and. by a
vote of 476 to 2G5 accepted Hoyd

Nationalist leader, and Joseph 'Dev
lin thus secured no narrow mar
ginal triumph, but virtually- a two
tlilrds majority vote. This 'striking"
vqte on the part of the Nationalists
from counties especially affected by
homo rule means that, a settlement
of the situation virtually is in
sight, as the Ulster Unionists al
ready havo accepted Lloyd-George's
plan. Since this is the decision of
Irishmen who will bo excluded from
the operations of home rule and
who thus are principally" 'concerned,
it is not expected that any further
serious opposition to the proposals
will be made. The most powerful
of all arguments that recommend
tho adoption of the settlement pro
posals was the clear intimation in
the convention that John Redmond
had staked hte .position and carew
upon acceptance by the coMveatis,

gates, were almost all for rejecting
the plan. John Dillon said ho
would not shed a tear if tho con
vention rejected tho proposed set
tlement, but that in view of all

From Rome the Associated Press

lengthy conference Saturday with
the Spanish Ambassador. It is re

of Spain to mediate between the
United States and Mexico. His
Holiness views with the greatest
reeret the possibility of war be

The Pope, since tho beginning of
tho European war, has looked to
the United States as the power
most likely to take an effective
step 'for peace ln Europe at the
proper tlmo and to invoke respect
for international law nnd tho laws
of humanity and all belligerents.
He believes the United States would

BALANCE WHEEL OF PROGRESS
The church Is the balance wheel
of human progress. Her quiet self
possession in the midst of great
popular clamor for extreme reform
has become proverbial. Calmly she
points out the error and tho danger
in the radical demand of any par
ticular placo or period and at tho
samo time recognizes its element of
truth. Her own programme she '
can always show has long ago an
ticipated the need and provided for.
It. The widespread eugenic move
ment for the regulation of tho mar
ital relationship was a recent and'
interesting evidence of this, old
story. AH of a sudden certain
scientific gentlemen had awakened
to the fact that all marriages -were1

Catholic thought, could Hot agree
with such ajaropotfal. Jt pointed to
the fact that the church had always,
recognized that, there were certain
marrittgec which, because of the
evil results, to health and morals of
the offspring, were prohibited by
the natural, law. Their prevention
was to be the work of moral,, re
straint and education among the
people, rather than by arbitrary ae-t
tion of the State. As a Ian re

had for another time clearly out
lived its "medieval" usefulness.
Alas for them, the pendulum Is
swinging back again at this very
early day. In tho Survey of Juno
3, a very Instructive articlo by Dr.
Adolph Meyer, of John Hopkins
University, vindicates tho Catholic
view. Dr. Meyer, it Is well to note.
Is hailed by that journal as "one
of our greatest psychiatrists." Very
emphatically does he declare that
"the 'condition from heredity study
can not be codified in the form of
legislation. A careful student of
tho literature and of the facts of
eugenics realizes the complexity of
the problem and tho reason why
we should be cautious about push
ing everything to the point of legis
lative enactment." Even many of
thoso of a so-called tainted strain
can marry if proper care be exer
cised In the choice of a partner.
Education Is Indeed needed and the
prevention of undesirable matings.
There is a sane remedy for this,
however. "Tho first help," ho says,
"is protection of the foolish against
playing with the holiest of all
sacraments marriage." Ho points
to the regulations In force in Swit
zerland, that "no marrlago license
Is valid that has not been posted
for three week.s by the civil authori
ties and published in tho newspa
pers." It is this which ho recom
mends for this country. "Runaway
matches and marrying parsons," ho
says, "have no place under such
conditions."
Hero we have a strong, unquali
fied endorsement of the stand which
the church has taken. Long ago
did she throw this suggested safe
