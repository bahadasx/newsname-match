THIS STATUE OF THOMAS JEFFERSON, THE WORK OF KARL
BITTER, ADORNS THE FRONT OF THE COUNTY COURT
HOUSE IN CLEVELAND, 0. IT IS CONSIDERED A WORK
OF EXCEPTIONAL VIGOR AND FINE MODELING.
IATE in the afternoon of the Fourth
of July, 1776, the old bell in
f the statehouse at Philadelphia
rang out a joyous peal. A few
moments before, exhausted by the
great heat and vexed to desperation
by a multitude of flies, the fathers of
this country's liberties had unanimous
ly adopted the Declaration which sev
ered the thirteen colonies from Great
Britain and made the United States of
America forever free and independent.
To a certain tall, lanky, sandy hair
ed delegate from Virginia, who had
sat silent while his colleagues wran
gled over the form and phraseology of
the document, the action of the con
gress was a great relief, for in those
days he had listened to much acri
monious criticism of the paper and had

Maddalena Gets Ten
Years in Penitentiary
Dominick Madeline was sen
tenced Monday morning to serve
not less than 10 or more years
in the penitentiary for the kill
ing of Lolgi Cicero at Heilwood
one year ago. He pleaded guilty
to murder of the second degree.
W. S. Smith, a colored gentle
man from Dußois, pleaded guil

on D. M. Brown, of the Clawson
House, and cashing it at the De

him $5OO and sent him for one

out - entirely, ana Thomas Jefferson
could not sit by and see the child of
his brain torn and rended with feelings
of indifference any more than any oth
er man. Yet in spite of the diversity
of opinions among his fellow delegates,
who suppressed in all some eighteen
of the more fiery passages in the docu
ment, few other changes or additions
were made.
A year before, when Thomas Jeffer
son, lately elected delegate to the Con
tinental congress from Virginia, had
gone riding into Philadelphia, he had
no premonition that he was to perform
the greatest task that could have been
assigned to a patriot, the writing of
the Declaration of Independence. A
member of the Virginia house of bur
gesses from 17G9, he had already made
himself felt in public life in his own
colony,, .But it was not until he found

Brutal Murder Near
Lockport on Sunday
John Reck Slashed from Ear
to Ear by Pete Ferro after
a Quarrel Resulting from a
Drinking Spree.
Pete Farro is a prisoner in
the county jail charged with the
murder of John Reck at Climax
mines just opposite Lockport,
this county, on Sunday morn
ing between the hours of one
and four o'clock. The cause of
the murder is unknown aside
that some trouble arose after an
all-night's drinking bout.
Farro virtually admits com
mitting the crime but says that
he does not know much about the
circumstances as he had been
drinking. The accused told at
the inquest that he and the de
ceased had been attacked and |
robbed by bandits and during
the scuffle one of the robbers had
knifed Reck. When the body
was found, $4O was in one of his
pockets and as Farro had $35 in
his clothes when he was arrest
ed, the robbery theory was dis
proved.
