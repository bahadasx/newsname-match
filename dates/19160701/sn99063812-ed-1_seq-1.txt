tho world will watch closely his execu

or failure of this gigantic venture.
The "petitions to be circulated will
ask for the construction of a Reed road
connecting Crescent with Odell and
Crescent lakes, two of the prettlost
lakes In Oregon. The distance would
bo nineteen miles to these lakes, From
there, the route would bo along tho

The Crescent people do not seek a

road from Crescent oyer the moun

K. F. COMPANY OFFERS
SERVICES TO COL
GANTENBEIN'S
INFANTRY
At liiMt night's meeting of those In
terested In (ho fonuntlon of n military
company horn, h motion was unani
mously passed to otter tint services of
tlio I'timpuny ns n unit In the volunteer
regiment being tenlnlively raised by
Colonel C. If. Oantciiboln. The Idcn In
to offer n company from horn, so the
Klamath moil, In case, they are culled
ant, will ko to llio front as a unit, with
their own officers, surgeons, etc.
Tfiu following telegram- was sunt lo
Colonel Ountenbeln last night:
"Klamath Fulls begs permission to
inlso u company for your regiment.
Sixty-five men, IncluilltiK many with
military experience, enrolled already,
untl (ho rest will be enrolled In a few
days, when organisation work will
start. Please advise, ns we wish to
Join us u company."
It Is the Intention to organize the
company soon as' possible. There
fore, n campaign Is to bo made to se
cure enough men to Insure the muster
ing In or ISO physically fit members. A
recruiting committee, composed of J.
V. Corkcry, Lester I Torwllllger. C. T.
Oliver and Louis Martin was appoint
ed last night, and these men will runkv
a canvass of tho county, seeking pros
pective members.
Tim volunteers received their first
taste of hostilities toward tho end of
tho rncctlnK. when Mr. Morgan, who
claimed to represent the Anti-War So
ciety of New York, arose to dispute tbu
organization of a company bore, hold
ing the men would go forth to give
their lives for the protection of the in
terests of Hearst and other American
millionaires. His talk was decidedly
not n plea for patriotism, despite Mor
gan's claim that lie had followed tho
flag In tho Philippines, In Mexico and
elsewhoro, und the reception It re
ceived showed that the remarks were
dcldedly Ill-timed,
W. 11, A. Rentier was tbu first to his
feet, and ho poured forth a bltlor de
nunciation of such remarks, doclarlng
them to bo traitorous and anarchistic,
and ho stuted that If it wore any placo
but at this particular meeting, where
tho men present sought to keep their
control, Morgan might be treated to
mob violence. 'Hennur cited his own
evolution from a farmhand and day
laborer to a place beforo tho bar as one
of tho millions. of cases that could only
be brought about under tho protection
of the American (lug, anil ho declared
himself roady to resent any such re
marks wbenover and wherever ho
heard them. The excoriation of' the
visitor and tho splendid tribute paid
tho flag and all it stands for made an
address, which, although extemporane
ous, stirred the patriotism of all pres
ent to the doptbs, and made each man
proud to bo an American, and a candi
date for an organization being raised to
fight for Amerlcun principles, ,
C, T. Oliver also arose to denounce
the speech, as did Dr, Johnson and sev
eral others. There were cries of "put
him out," and hisses for Morgan, but
when he arose to speak again, he was
accorded the. privilege of the floor. His
remarks this time wore jn defense of
bis statement, with trie allegation that
it Is the food prepared by the big pack
ing bouses that kill off the soldiers.
Asked by, C, V, Stone regarding bis
army experience, Morgan stated tbat
bis service was n the navy,
J, B, McAlllstr then arose to his feet
and stated that although Morgan did
not care to serve bis country, there
are plenty of red-blooded Americans
who did, and be moved tbat Colonel
Qantenbsln be notlled of the intention-
to organise here. This carried amid a
thunder of cheers, and Morgan depart
ed. The meeting was n rcul rousing uf
fair, ami tho jseneml opinion prevailed
that Klamath Pnlls should orKunlxe u
company for service In Mexico If need
ed und its ii national guard ornntilia
tlon for preparedness If not needed In
the south. The speakers ut contended
that the Klamath men must go us a
company, not scattered to fill up other
companies, and more than one man of
prominence arose to say that he would
rather go to the front us a private In a
Klamath company, composed or willing
men, than as an officer In some other
organization.
Charles K. Stone talked of the ad
vantages of the military training, and
urged action as much as possible. Dr.
Johnson spoke of the great fighting
unit n Klamath county company, com
posed of KlamalU.mon, full of resource
fulness, would be, and" ho hold that
there should also be raised In conjunc
tion it Klnmath hospital corps, to sco
that Klamath men lire properly cured
for by Klamath doctors and assistants,
Dr. Cnthey also spoke for u hospital
corps.
Captain Lee, a Confederate veteran,
spoke heartily In favor of a Klamath
company, ns did J. W. Rodflold, who
wont the blue In the Ws. Iloth men
inndo sincere, patriotic appeals, us did
Homier In his 11 rst tulk, In which he
urged tho securing of enough men at
once to Insure a company, and then
proceed at once with tho organization,
his motion for the uppointmont of n
commltteo to make u thorough canvass
belnn carried by a unanimous vote,
O. A. Stearns spoko of tho benefits of
the military training, also of tho trait
of leaving It all to tho other follow,
Instead of getting ready for eventual
ities In tltno of peace. C. T. Oliver also
spoko of the need of preparcdnoss, cit
ing the example shown In Buropo ut
the outbreak of (ho war, and stated
that whllo he hopos to bo ablo to bo a
member of the company, ho will do his
best in the moantlmo to securo aa
many recruits ns possible
Dr. Leonard spoko of tho nood of
ceding many more than (ho required
nnmbor of men, owing to the strictness
of tho physical tests, and Captain O, C
Applei;uto and City School Superin
tendent Dunbar spake of tho advant
ages of military training, the gain from
discipline, and the splendid patriotism
It Instills Into the hearts of all who
