Use or the Unexcelled Facilities
of Omaha Union Stock Yards
The National Swine Show which la
to be held at Omaha, Oct. 2 to 7, this
rear, will be a big event, and is al
ready attracting much attention.
More than 3,000 head of hogs will be
exhibited. ,By that ;time the Im
provement that are' now under way
will be completed, giving to Omaha
the finest hog yards in the world.
That Is patting it pretty strong, but
from all we can learn the facts justi

however, will be. held: in the new
horse barn. '

Important things that the careful
showman is looking out for. We ar
rived home with this thought fixed in
our mind:
If. all the other phases of the big
show are as uniformly satisfactory,
high-class and adequate as the -facilities
for handling It, there will be no
question about it being the greatest
how that was ever held, anywhere.

Daylight Everywhere
In all the big pavilion there is not
a poor pen, euner as regaras loca
tion, convenience or light. It Is sure
ly a daylight affair. Ia all the big
main building, which is fireproof,
ralnDroof. and as nearly germproof
as any building can be, there is not
ery corner. There are just two sites
of pens, the double and the single
ones, the former being just twice the
sixe of the latter. The single pens
are 5 ft. x 9 ft., and large enough to
accommodate one big fellow or a
couple of small ones. The double
pens are 10 ft z 9 ft
- Feed will be delivered, If desired,
to the pens every morning. There Is
also a rack or shelf at the front of
each pen that will hold enough feed
for several days.
Two forge Show Kings
Two large show rings, situated
where the light Is unusually good,
and with plenty of ringside seats,
are available. '

it is to show your hogs under the
Ideal conditions until you ship Into
A New Organization
Katloual Traders' Uve Stock Ei

Ilulla as First President
A class of men doing business at
the live stock maraets, commonly
known as traders, constitute an im
portant factor in making a demand
for the stuff shipped there for sale
and in equalising prices. Their ben
efit to the market is most noticeable
when there Is an unusually heavy run
of live stock and when packers seem
disposed to beat down prices. ' By
being in position to hold the stuff
which they buy for a while, If neces
sary, and in filling out-of-town or
ders, they create a demand that Ik

The following description of the
arrangements that are being made at
Omaha for the accommodation of the
National Swine Show is-taken from
The Duroc Bulletin, published at Chi
cago, and Is written by podge Jones,
business manager of that publication:
Splendid Fci
Swine breeders will fi$d oceans of
room, light, convenience and ade
quate sanitary precautions.
Eastern breederj and others who
have not had the opportunity of per
sonally acquainting themselves with
the facilities for handling the Nation
al Swine Show at, Omaha' have been
naturally and rightly curious as to
just what they could expect In the
way of accommodattpn' for. their hogs.
The writer, too. was. curious to the
extent of going to vOmah last week
and spending a duKeeelqg for him
self, at first hanavfsS ftw xkibit-
a dark corner. You can show every
inch of your hog, from the tip of bis
toes to the end of his nose, at any
hour of the day, In any pen In the
building, and you can show him
right
The sanitary end of It Is also wor
thy of more than passing notice. The
pavilion is floored with concrete thru
out, and so arranged that every peg
and every alley, In fact, every foot of
floor space, can be flooded and clean
ed every morning. There is running
water accessible to all the pens, and
Instead of having to drive out your
hog and wash him in a mud puddle,
you merely drive him into the alley
back of bia pen and wash him on a
concrete floor over a drain.
Pens Concrete, Too
The pens are all solid concrete,
and so arranged that the light, com
ing down from above, farm eat es ev-
Omaha next October and drive your
good ones Into the National Swine
Show. .
Blgnell Sold Fine Cattle
Wm. Blgnell, of Blgnell Brothers,
sold four carloads of fine grass beeves
on the South Omaha market Monday
morning at a price of $1 from the
killers. Mr. Blgnell, In an interview
with the Dally Drovers Journal, pre
dicted a big hay crop and plenty of
feed for the coming winter. Blgnell
Brothers ship each year several car
loads of fine "grassers" during the
grass season to this market.

At most, if not all, of the large live
