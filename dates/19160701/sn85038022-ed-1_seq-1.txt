The New House Dresses
The development of these garments has been remarkable. No longer are they
strictly "house dresses." They have the neatness and prcttiness, conveyed by the
terms "porch" and "neighborhood" dresses. In other words, if the door bell an
nounces an unexpected caller, one may appear without apology. The dresses are
not only dainty and pretty, but comfortable and practicable. Our preparations this
ytar have been upon a larger than ever scale. We are prepared to furnish you
with the best that has been produced, and at the nominal price of
