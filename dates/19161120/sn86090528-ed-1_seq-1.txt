By United Press.
Oklahoma City, Nov. 20. Oklahoma
City is today the hub of a wheel whose
spokes are highways teeming with
nutos bringing delegates to the un.a.V
Trail convention.
According to reports received at
noon four hundred cars were coming
from Mangum and other towns along
the central route. Seventy-five cars
came from Tulsa. The town is rap
idly filling up. There' will be a big
parade at 4:30 this afternoon.
Tulsa was the first delegation of
the ground bidding for the 1917 con
vention against Amarillo and Joplin.
The convention will last through Wed
nesday. On to the Convention.
The prospective Ozark Trail from
Mangum to Oklahoma City and
through Grady county was today a
trail of dust and autos.
About 2.0 reached Chickasha from
points west as far as Amarillo at noon
today aim were met by 100 or more
Chickasha cars at the railroad cross
ing on tho Pocasset road northwest of
town. Some in the latter end of the
procession failed to come into town
hut most of them came as far as the
outskirts before turning back to re
sume their journey.
Between forty and fifty Chickasha
cars joined the expedition here with
Captain Ed Burton in command, driv
ing the official car. The Chickasha
cars bore banners which told plainly
that the Ozark Trail must come this
' way. All of the local cars were load
ed with boosters and the band also ac
companied them.
"Chickasha is all right," yelled the
boosters from the west, as amid honks
In many tones, they hastened through
tho long lane of cars on either side of
the road as they headed for town.
.The fact that the visitors had a fast
schedule in order to reach Oklahoma
City in time for the parado this after
noon mada It Impossible for them to
tarry in Chickasha. Mangum, Hobart,
Carnegie and Anadarko had large del
egations. They started from Mangum
at 5 o'clock this morning.
The convention at Oklahoma City
vill open tomorrow morning and will
be in session two (lays. The delega
tion from the southwest is expected
to be one of the largest there and will
make a determined effort to pull the
proposed rational highway this way.
I is pot expected that the route of
the road through Oklahoma will be
decided at this time but all of the
competing routes will make an effort
to convince Col. Harvey and his asso
ciates that they should have the road.
At the rally that was held Saturday
evening at K. P. lia'l, following the
"banquet of the Grady County Breed
er's association, good roads enthusi
asm ran high The main idea devel
oped by the speakers "was that, re
gardless of the success or failure of
the efforts to land the Ozark Trail,
there can be no better time than row
for a concerted movement for better
highways In the county.- "In the midst
of the present prosperity of the coun
try we can make no better investment
lit our money than to put It into permanent-,
rods," declared L. C. Hutson
in the course of his talk.
Tutt.le sent a delegation of ;!0 or
more -UizeiK' to convey the message
that that Vj'i wanted to join with
Chickasha in ihe Ozark Trail expedi
tion. T. J. Brown, postmaster, acted
as spokesman for the Tuttle delega
tion. Rev. L. L. Qjhen made a strong
speech upon the importance of the
Ozark Trail and good roads generally
and other speakers expressed similar
sentiments. Dr. R. J. Gordon, of Nin-

Chickasha resulted from a miscalcu
lation as to the driver's ability to boa
a Rock Island train to the crossing
five miles north of Chickasha at 8:45
yesterday morning, according to the
railroad men's version. Two mangled
bodies and a
Ford automobile told the gruesome ,
story whose details are better left to j
the imagination.
Thomas Johns, a prominent stock-1
raiser and member of the firm of,
Johns brothers, who for many years
has been a highly respected citizen
of this community, and Egbert Home,
tho fourteen year old son of W. V.
Home, one of the owners of the. Eagle
Mercantile company and a large
stockholder and director of the Citi
zens National bank, are today lying in
state- in the undertaking parlors of the
Clayeomb and Anderson undertaking i
company, every fragment of flesh
available having been necessary to
build up their heads until presentable.
According to the railroad people,
Mangum passenger train No. 70!) was
coming toward Chickasha at tho reg
ular rate of speed and when approach
ing the crossing five miles north of
here and a half milo beyond; what is
known as the Solito siding, Engineer
James Hutson blew his whistle at the
usual distance.
The topography of the country
around this place is such, it is claim
ed, as to enable an autoist to see a
train for a distance of at least half a
mile. The train had almost reached
the siding when Fireman Porter real
ized that the driver of the car would
attempt to cross tho track from his
side and hastily notified the engineer.
The latter, who could not see the car
'rom his side of the cab, did not know
of f' ?'!ce until the moment of
. ,..t,pact when, striking the car antid
ship, it threw it for a distance of one
hundred feet, carrying with it the even
then lifeless body of the boy driver
who suffered instant death. Mr.
Johns' body was carried for some dis
tance by the engine before the train
was brought to a stop.
The remains were borne to the train
and brought into Chickasha to the em
balming parlors of Claycomb and An
derson. The families of the victims
were immediately notified of the terri-l
bio misfortune which had befallen
them. Mr. and Mrs. Ed Johns, the lat-j
ter a brother and partner of the de
ceased, were at Hempstead, Texas,
attending the funeral of Mrs. Johns'
father and came on immediately to
Chickasha, Mr. Johns arriving early
this morning and his wife expecting
to arrive on the "Firefly" this even
ing.
Grandma Johns, who had remained
in Chickasha, was advised of her son's
death immediately following the acci
dent and the shock is said to have
caused a very serious condition. .
"Dad" Williams, an employe of the
gia of Grover Bryant at Pocasset, was
an eye witness. He told the father
of tho dead boy that he was on the
opposite Bide of the track and saw
the Ford coming at a rate of about
fifteen miles un hour. He shouted to
Egbert to stop but the latter appar
ently did not hear him or paid no at
tention to him. Mr. Williams believ
ed tbo boy did not see the approach
ing train. The Pocasset man had
stopped his team on the opposite side
of the crossing in order to let the
train pass.
The funeral services over the de
ceased will take place tomorrow.
Those of Mr. Johnb will be held from
the residence of his brother, Ed Johns,
at fi02 South Fourteenth street, at
10:30 a. m., to be conducted by Rev.,'
Frtward B. TcK bu-iiil in Odd pel-'
lows cemetery.
Tho services over the remains of
Egbert Home will he held at the Ep
worth Methodist church at 3:;0 p. in.
conducted by Rev. L. L. Cohen, Jr.
Tho pallbearers have not yet been se
lected. The entire community was shocked
at tho news of the dreadful tragedy
and extend their sympathy to the sur
viving families.
Egbert llorno was fourteen years
old in October.

With Substantial Assurance of Suppoi
Grady County Stockmen Band To

ROUSING SPEECHES
AFTER BANQUET
Encouragement Ofered by Local Citizen:
and Practical Talks Made by Prom
inent Breeders
Amid intense enthusiasm and with
assurances of moral support seldom
vouchsafed by any community, the
Grady County Breeders and Seeders
Live Slock association was perma
nently organized Saturday afternoon
at the Farm and Commercial bureau.
Tho meeting was called to order by
Dr. R, J, Gordon, president of the
Rood roads association, who explained
the object and purposes of the organ
isation.
Permanent organization being ef
fected Dr. Gordon was elected presi
dent. The aim of the association, he
stated, was to further the movement
for better livestock raising f Grady
county and to advance the Interests
of livestock raisers. ;
Among its other advantages, he
said, the association would furnish
mutual protection for each man and
permit of greater facility In the inves
tigation of the title and quantity of
cattle and other livestock which in
the future might by bought, by, its
members.
Dan Stevens of Ninneltah was elect
ed first vice president and E. Hurst
of Pocasset, second vice president.
It. A. Lyle, a hog raiser of Grady
county, was elected secretary and Dud
Roland, who captured the loving cup
wi'.h his herd at the Grudy county free
fair and is famed for his fine Durocs,
was made treusurer.
Splendid talks were made by Frank

agriculture of Oklahoma, Willis Gen
try, O. C. Cooper and Col. E. J. Hub
bard. Mr. Gault, besides being at the head
of the state board. Is a breeder of
champion Herefords and has had a
board experience in tho Hue along
which tho association will work. He
pra'sed the object of Ihe meeting do
olrj'ius it to bo the only way to secure
letter livestock. The association
jught to have front 800 to 1.000 mem
bers iu Grady county within a year, .
he said. , ,
Grady County the Best.
The head of the slate agricultural
department told of his experience In
the pure breed business. His begin
ning was not very encouraging. Sor
the first few years he lost money but
later made it till har.K. "The profits
are big," he declared. "Better than
oil wells," he asserted, "and I hav
had both."
Grady county, he said, was admira
bly situated for the raising of fine -bred
stock. Possessing the best nat
ural advantages such as a line soil
and considerable grass, local condi
tions were furl Iter enhanced by the
raising of an abundance of alfalfa for
forage.
He Impressed upon bleeders the im
portance, before buying cattle at any
sales, of being sure that the animals
are in no way infected. Inspect every
animal, particularly for tuberculosis.
Cattle raisers at sales will sometimes
try to pan off infected pure bred stuff
on unsuspecting buyers.
The agricultural department, he de
clared, was at all times ready and
willing to help any feeder or breeder
in Oklahoma in any possible way.
Urged to Contribute Stock.
Before adjournment it was decided
that the association should bold two
sales each year- -'ne first one to be
held on March 15. and the second in

in the county is urged to contribute
stock for sales al these meetings.
