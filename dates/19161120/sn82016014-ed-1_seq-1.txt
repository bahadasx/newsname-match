Formal Signing of Certificates
Closes Deal.
Certificates permitting the sale of
the Kansas Natural Gas company
properties to the Doherty interests of
Wichita, will be granted late this aff
ernoon by the public utilities cornmis
sion. Members of the commission re
turned today from Washington to ap
prove the sale. In offices of the com
mission this afternoon it was stated
that the only procedure which remains
to close the pas deal is the form-il
signing of the certificates.
The Doherty interests are taking
over the controlling interest in the gas
company. It is asserted they have
paid $40 a share for the stock, which
has a par value of J 50. Un ler a con
tract between the two companies, the
deal is to be formally closei by Satur
day of this week.
I'nder the approval of the state
commission, the Doherty interests are
aid to agree to furnish gas at 2S
cents a thousand feet. This is the
rate approved by the state commis
sion in an order made nearly a year
ago. It is believed that the Doherty
interests will immediately take over
the Kansas Natural properties and
that a formal transfer will not be de
layed. John Kinkel, a member of the com
mission, stated this afternoon that
certificates approving the transfer
will be approved by the commission
as soon as they are presented. The
transfer would have been approved at
p. recent meeting in Ottawa, he de
clared, had the documents covering
the transfer been ready for approval
lit that time.

Washington, Nov. 20. The first ses
sion today of the Joint congressional
committee investigating the broad sub
ject of transportation developed into
a preliminary meeting at which Chair
man Newlands made a general state
ment of the good purposes of the in
vestigation and practically all the
prospective witnesses maneuvered to
avoid appearing first. Each wanted
the other to take the lead because all
said they wanted to avoid to have
their plans prejudiced.
The railroads were not ready to go
on and the state railway commission
ers said they preferred not to be
heard until the first week in Decem
ber. Many Interests Represented.
Washington, Nov. 20. The curtain
lifted here on one of the most dra
matic battles in industrial units in the
nation's history today. The joint
committee on Interstate commerce
started its investigation of conditions
relating to interstate and foreign
commerce and the necessity for fur
ther regulation along the lines of the
Adamson eight-hour law and to near
ly ail interstate public utilities.
Represented in the fight are com
mercial organizations of all kinds and
from all over the country great man
ufacturing corporations and indus
tries. Every influence of capital and
labor will clash during the hearings.
The railroad fight will be directed
by the railway executives' advisory
committee of which Frank Trumbull,
chairman of the Chesapeake & OhiD,
is the head. The brotherhoods will
nave their four chiefs Stone of the
engineers. Carter of the firemen. Lea

the city ready for work. Each side
is armed with statistics to support
contentions that have been made for
years.
Forget the Public.
"The public is the interest most to
be considered in this controversy,"
Judee Adamson. vice chairman of the
ioint congressional committee and
narent of the eight-hour law, said to
day. "Both the railroads and the
brotherhoods seem for the moment to
forget that they are our servants in
this matter."
During the day. Judge Adamsoi

the question of putting thru congress

posed for settlement and prevention of

of
Male Champion Flyer.
New York. Nov. 20. Ruth Law. a
smiling, little American, took her
place as the premier woman aviator
of the world today, when she equalled
the American record for cross-country
flying.
She landed at Governor's Island at
9:38 a. m., having flown 840 miles
from Chicago in an old style exhibi
tion aeroplane.
Miss Law made but '.wo stops, the
first at Hornwell. N. Y., the second at
Binghamton. N. Y., last night when
she was forced to alight because she
had run out of gasoline.
Fully exposed to the wind and coid,
owing to the fact that the type of
machine she drove forced her to sit
out in front of her motor without any
shield for protection, the plucky
young woman outstripped Victor Carl
strom's record for continuous cross
country flight made on November 2.
in the very latest type of machine,
and then continued her journey, and
flew farther than has any woman be
fore in history.
840 Miles In One Flight.
Miss Law left Chicago at 7:25 (cen
tral time) Sunday morning. She
reached Hornwell, 590 miles away, at
3:24, continuing 120 miles farther to
Binghamton, reaching there at 4:20
p. m. and then resumed her flight
early this morning.
Her flying time for the entire trip
was eight hours and fifty-nine min
utes. Miss Law Numb With Cold.
Numb with cold. Miss Law was
helped from her aeroplane at Gover
nor's Island by Major General Wood,
Henry Woodhouse and Augustus Post,
the. latter two governors of the Aero
Club of America. The plucky little
woman was immediately hustled into
an automobile and rushed to an army
officer's house to "thaw out."
The last leg of the flight 270 miles
was made thru a dense fog. Miss
Law said the fog was so heavy that
she was forced to fly very low. barely
topping the hills along the Hudson,
in order to be able to see the ground
and keep her bearings. The fog was
so dense, in fact, that her flight was
followed with difficulty after she left
Binghamton. The report was received
of her passing Port Jervis, but at
many points the aeroplane was invisi
ble because of the mist.
Rand and Parade Greet Her.
I followed the Delaware & Sus
quehanna railroad for a time after
leaving Binghamton," Miss Law said.
"Then I cut across-country. It was
pretty cold, but naturally it wasn't as
bad as yesterday, when I was in the
air much longer. I finished the trip
without taking on any gasoline in ad
dition to that with which the tanks
were replenished at Hornell.
"I barely had enough to finish on.
As I neared Governor's Island the en
gine was using the last. I volplaned
to the earth and landed with the tank
practically empty."
Miss Law was given a rousing re
ception when she landed on Governor's
Island. A band at the nead of a de

Woman the Greatest Tempter
Young Man Faces in N. Y.
Wasted Time, Social Ambition,
Among Variety of Opinions.
New Tork. Nov. 20. Jacob H.
Schiff believes woman is the greatest
temptation a young man faces in New
York. .-
Schiff's was one of several replies
received today by Dr. F. W. Adams to
his query:
What is the most susceptible
temptation to young men and women
in New York?"
John Wanamaker said: "Wasted
time is at the bottom of more sin than
anything else."
Fifty dollars spent on a twenty-dollar
income, was the reply of President
Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia.
"To be crooked in business to gain
social success," was the opinion of
Chief Justice Issac F. Russell.
Katherine B. Davles said it was the
desire for pleasure, and Mabel Craily,
of the Y. W. C. A., said it was the de
sire for clothes.
Doctor Adams himself said it was
the desire to pose, to be unreal.

make an appearance in this world.
They usually die a short time after

combs fall off, and the bees are placed
in a new hive.
It is proposed that inspectors of
fruit trees from the university and

spect the bees. The laws of Kansas
governing bees and honey satisfy the
keepers, Mr. Keene stated this morn

Keene announced today. The honey
and wax from these hives amount to
$200,000. The largest colony of bees

Capture of Gret Importance.
Military critics here today agreed
that capture of Monastir is of the
greatest importance Diplomatically
most of the credit is given to the Ser

Attorney General Brewster Di
rects Immediate Investigation.
Violations of Anti-Trust Law
Slay Be Found as Result.
.COMPLAINT FROM KANSAS CITY
Indication That Coal Companies
Have Pooled Their Interests.
Rapidly Advancing Prices Exist
Turnout the State 'ow.
Following receipt of complaints to
day, from Kansas City, Kan., S. M.
Brewster, attorney general, directed an
investigation of the alleged coal com
bine in this state. Based on evidence
sent to state departments, from city
officials in the Kansas side town, a
state-wide investigation of coal prices
may be ordered. Should -he investi
gations warrant prosecutions, com
plaints may be filed against a number
of companies for violation of the anti
trust laws.
The Kansas City'complaint indicates
strongly that thirteen coal companies
have pooled their interests to control
the price of coal. Bids were asked on
iy to forty thousand tons of coal.
Just one company responded with
bid. It was exorbitant, the complaint
declares. Another company placed a
bid for a small amount of low grade
coal at a price that was declared -unreasonable.
That the public pays a thousand per
cent on the recent wage increase to
miners, was the inference in the Kan
sas City complaint. It is charged in
the letter to Brewster that coal miners
were recently allowed an increase of
10 cents a ton for mining coal. Fol
lowing this increase, the public was
charged a dollar a ton extra to meet
the increased cost of production. Based
on those claims, the state is asked to
conduct an investigation.
Thirteen Comaiiies.
Names of thirteen coal companies,
many of them large producing con
cerns, were furnished the by tho
Kansas City officials. It is charged
that these companies have entered
into a pool or agreement for the con
into a pol or agreementxfor the con
trol of the coal market. Eleven .f
th thirteen companies refused to bid
for the contracts offered, the corn
plaint charges. There was but one
bid which the city could in any mp.n
ner consider and this bid was regard
ed as unreasonable and exorbitant. It
was impossible, the complainants de
clare, to secme. lair competitive bid
ding. In view of coal cenditions in Kan
sas and the rapidly advancing prices.
j U is probable that the attorney gen
era,-officfl may begin a state-wi.i,

i Beneral is to be sent to Kansas City .

that city. Investigations, it is report
ed, are to be conducted in other citioti.
Based on testimony gathered in thnj
hearings, the attorney general will c"(e

tions under the anti-trust laws.
