day. State railroad -commissioners

Referring to government ownership,
Senator Newlands said: '! .
; "It Is a question that must be faeed.
Other nations far advanced in civiii
; ' zation have adopted the system.' -Re-,
centiy, under, the stress of war, al-
most aH European governments have
taken , "over the railways, Whether
, that wi ll b e a permanent taking over
or only .temporary 'one, 'it demon
strates that in conditions of great
crises when autocratic powers must
- begivenlto the government, all intel
. ligent governments drift toward abso
, lute and complete operation of the
, roads as the only solution of the ques
. tion. , ' ; -..'- . :.h '
"It -we pursue the exercise and the
study :of government regulation wise-
iy. persistently land energetically Ve
may create such a system of regula
tion as will meet every requirement,
' both Jin Ume of peace and war and in
. exigency or crises; but, it seems to be
. a w$se thing forV the , government of
. 'the United States to ascertain; now
the history of the countries that have
' adopted , government ownership? and
operation of railways " and to watch
. I the experience of the European coun-
f 'tries in this great war in-this regard!
"In this connection will , come Hhe
- question of the method of taking over
; the railroads. . Shall it be accomplish
t ed by an actual valuation of the rail
, ways and a condemnation of them, or
shaH they be taken over by the easier
'. method of taking over the stocks and
'. the bonds at their market value, thus
' j at one step having the national gov-,
! erament take the position . of stock
, holder and security bolder in these
great corporations?"
. Strikes as a means of settling labor
"disputes, Senator .Newlands charac
' terized as the "most barbaric and bru
tal of processes."
,, v , -rh: - question ' is,'. he added,
whether a nation pretending to some
, degree; of civilization, which has eli
! minated the doctrine of force from
r' application to controversies between
man and man, and which furnishes
; Judicial' tribunals for, the settlement
of those controversies; and whicti is
, now and has beenf or years endeavor
i inginternatiO,nally to' secure a system
under which the nations of the earth
wili contribute similar efforts for the
.adjustment of international disputes
. without resort to force whether a ci
, villzed nation can be content to per
jAnate the existing .conditions."
The." hours and wages of employes
. .must, be considered carefully, Senator
;. Newlands declared, because the bur
dens which constitute the operating
expenses, of these corporations are in
v time transferred to the shippers." He
-added;- , v, -... '.. ... , . . . ,..

City Planner Nolen Says
Charity-Taking Faces
Park City Workers.
SAYS1 CHEAPEU BENT
SCHEDULE IS NEEDED
Warns City Against Land
Speculators and Criticises
the .Latter.
Bridgeport's workingmen must get
better wages, ( cheaper rents and
cheaper necessities of life, or they
must put their wives and children to
work,' take in boarders or accept
charity,, according to John Nolen. the
city planner, who has made a study
of Bridgeport covering several years.
"Communities which seem to exist
by taking in one another's wishing
are not the. right sort of social units
for this country," Mr. Nolen says for
Bridgeport, according to statements
credited to him by Bristow Adams, in
an official pamphlet issued by the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States, at Washington, tliis month'.
Mr.; Nolen is quoted, at length on
Bridgeport, and ; his beliefs, 'which
probably have been expressed pri
vately to members of the Chamber of
Commerce in this city, are interest
ing. "Looks, like the ancient poser of
the irressistible , force running up
against the immovable 'body," he says.
"There's ho solution of the "problem
in its most acute form, to affect more
than half the wage workers, until on
or more, of these points can be ad
justed. , ' i r:' '
"Here's the choice: Cut down the
cost of the house, lower the standard
of living, or raise wages. , Or, on the
other hand, put the wife and children
to work, take boarders or roomers, or
accept charity.
. "The second choice does not sound
so good and . these communities which
seem ,to exist; by taking, in one an
other's washing are not the right sort
of social omits for this" country.
' "Unregulated speculation bought up
a. lot "of the available tracts in and
around .Bridgeport and ' as a result
places suitable for workingmen
houses are hard to find ""at a fair
price. The movement ,for: more houses
for Bridgeport came too "late in this re
spect though real estate dealers had
disposed of some 5.0Q0 building lots
which were sold , on the .'instalment
plan and largely to workers who were
persuaded that "the purchase repre
sented an investment. .House build
ing did not k$ep pace with lot buying.
I "Much of the existing housing in
Bridgeport is bad very, bad. . Tene
ments are inflamable and overcrowd
ed, insanitary, especially 'down along
the tide creeks."
In summing up the Nolen report
plus what has already been done by
the . chamber of commerce and V the
Bridgeport Housing Co. to increase
unfurnished rents in this city, Adams
concludes his 'recapitulation by saying:
"Most of the developments (in other
cities) have been f through the activi
ties of individual firms which T solved
the problems for their . own workers.
Th worker objects to this, as he
thinks it takes away his independence
and much depends on niceties of ad
justment; " It is fatal to the success of
any housing plan if the worker feels
that he furnishes income not only
through his labor when ho is awake
and working,' but furnishes additional
income to his employer also through
rents' paid for the time he is idle or
asleep. Even though accommodatens
are better in . a: 'company house, a
worker who has this feeling will pre
fer to live in poor quarters, far from
work, and at higher rental."
.After recommending the Kenosha,
Wis., plan where no dependence is
placed on philanthrophy or charity the
writer concludes; s
"Bridgeport's plan and all the others
are worthy of watching and of imitat
ing as soon as their good points aro
established. '
Housing is a big business and
should be so handled. Nearly two and
and a half billions are spent annually
in dwellings alone and much of it is
not truly invested, because so many
houses fall short, of being satisfac
tory. Cheap construction means an'
economic loss of hundreds of millions
annually." , . , ; ,
Speaking . of the ' relation between
housing with .wages and standards of
living,v Mr. Nolen-is quoted: , ,
"First: A really decent home can
not . be provided for much less than
$2,000 including house, lot, street im
provements, public utilities and re
creation. With Bridgeport's need of
4,000 new houses, a simple calculation
shows, that an "eight million dollar
investment .is required in that one
town alone.
"Second:. A - house costing!. In the
neighborhood of $2,600 cannot be of
fered on the basis of an economic net
rent return - for less than $15 per
month.
"Third: The wage earner with the
normal, family of .wife and three . de
pendent children cannot afford to pay
$15 per month unless he has a wage
of $15 a week or nearly $800 a year.
This follows the time .tried domestic
economy axiom that housing must not
cost more than one-fourth t'he income.
"Fourth: More than half of the
fathers of workmens families earn
less than $15 a week.
"The main trouble is that the whole
housing question has been left to un
regulated speculation. And that's
what the matter with Bridgeport right
now.
A final report on Bridgeport for, the
Chamber of Commerce has been pre
pared by MT. No?en and . Mr. Adams
represents that the above statements
are contained in the report. At the
offices of the local Chamber of Com
merce, it was said the report is still
in the hands of the printers. .

line, in the actual flying time of nine
hours and one minute. .i
Miss Law was greeted on her ar

on her achievement.
She was ;onsideraibly chilled and was
taken to- the house of one of the offi
cers at the post to recuperate.
She had little to say about her flight
except that she had to fly much, lower
than she wanted to on account -of the
haze. It was the cause . of . remark
among those who examined her ma
chine here that its structure was such
as to expos her to the air more than
Is the cace in most modern airships.

flight Nov. 2 from" Chlcagb to New
oYrk. was. of the fusillage type, in the
cockpit of , which he , was protected
from the winds. In the present flight
Miss Law bettered Carlstrom's record
by about one hundred . miles, making
the 590 miles in an air line from Chi
