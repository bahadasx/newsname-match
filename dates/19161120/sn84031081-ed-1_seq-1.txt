SECRETARY LANE AND
PRESIDENT IN ACCORD
Lyis Cabrera Known to Be
Stumbling Block to Any De
finite Plan Being Formulated
by Mediation Board.
dfnt Wilson's complete, approval of
K,oun Hi-rrplary iJine will return
t0 Atlantic City tomorrow, determined
l(J Wing the scions of the American
MMlran Joint com mission to an eurly
elusion. It was clearly indicated
, official ''irel's l,1ut the 3"'nt C"n'
feren.e is about to end, agreement or
no agreement.
K the commissioners fail to formu
late a plan it is thought that the pros
poet of sealing border disputes
through diplomacy will be remote. Of
ficial make no prediction as to what
steps the Washington government
might take in that event to insure the
safety of border towns and ranches.
abinct 1" Accord.
(Secretary 1-ane Is understood to
have found President Wilson, Secre
tary Lansing and Secretary liaker In
full accord with him, on every point,
when he laid before them last night
a review of ttie efforts the American
commissioners had made to reach a
statement.
It is an open secret that Puis Ca
brera, president of the Mexican com
mission, has proved the stumbling
Work in the way of reaching an agree
ment. Commissioner Honillas, it is said,
has been ready to approve several
different suggestions for co-operative
a, hurt. Cabrera, however, held out
fur control of any Joint operations by
a Mexican military commander.
To llciuu Original Suggestion, j
" It Is believed the American commis
sioners will renew tomorrow their or
iginal suggestion: That each govern
ment patrol Its own side of the line
Independently, but with the under
ilandiiig that American troops will
pursue into Mexico on a hot trail any
bandits who attack border towns.
Coupled with that suggestion, pre
sumably, was the statement that Hen
em! Pershing's ton es would be with
drawn gradually from Mexico, and
that no large force would be sent
across! the line again unless the de
facto government permitted raiders to
assemble in such force in Mexico that
K stronf expedition was necessary to
prevent a serious attack.
Army officials believe the Amer
ican expeditionary force soon will lie
moving toward the border, regardless
of the turn events may take at At
lantic City. In its present psition,
many officials hold the expedition is
of no strategic value, while the long
iine of communication with the ad
vance base is a constant source of
danger.
Tronps to Itcnmiii at liordrr.
It was understood here that the
troops would not be ordered home
'hilf negotiations were pending'.
Official advices today indicated that
"11 of tho Americans at Parral had
made their escape and will soon arrive
in Xogalcs, Ariz. There has been
touch anxiety here because of persist -'"t
reports that Villa bandits had put
many foreigners to death when they
raided the town recently. The Amer
''ans, six or seven In number, are be
'tevpd to have made their way across
'hp Mountains to Culiacan, Sinaloa,
"nd started toward Nogales over the
"nt- of the Southern Pacific of Mexico.
The advices indicate that the Villa
forces are not in actual possession of
pTal, Jimenez, or any of the other
'0ns in that region.
The fate of the Chinese and other
wcigneis besides Americans in the
vicinity where the bandits are active,
s not definitely known, but it is he
, ed several Chitiene may have been
killed.

Bf EXPERIMENT
Six Men and Six Women Pro
pose to Continue Work and
Live Happily on Twenty-five
Cents a Day for Two Weeks
imr WOKNINO JOURNAL PICIAL LIASID Wll
Chicago, Nov. 19. Twelve heroic
individuals, six men and six women,
employes of Hie city health depart
ment, ate their Thanksgiving dinners
today and then gave their solemn
words to eat nothing for two weeks
but the scientific diet provided by a
public economy commission. They
will attempt to demonstrate the
theories of the commission that the
high cost of living is due to a greaT
degree to the apparent willingness of
the public to pay any price demanded
for its luxuries and that the public's
health, as well as its purse, would be
improved by an intelligent diet.
Meals to Cost H Cents.
John Dill Kobertsun, health com
missioner, savs he expects to feed the
twelve for JO a week, or at a trifle
more than S cents a meal.
The squad will weigh in at 8;;10
o'clock tomorrow morning. Their
weight will be carefully watched each
day of the two weeks. They will be
given three carefully prepared meals
each day and will be expected to do
their regular work, and will be per
mitted to drink only water between
meals.
A big commission merchant, who
admitted he had profited by high
prices, today attributed the increase
to the supine public "In former
vears if a house it c was asked to pay
40 cents a pound for biitiei," he said,
"she revolted and used a cheaper sub
stitute. This year she pays a'l cents.
Cohl Storage Profit.-.
"Therein lies the secret of present
high prices. There are liberal stocks
of butter and eggs in cold stoiage, and
the holders have made more money
than they ever expe.ted p. make Still
there is no way to make them sell a
product for '.''' cents if they can gel
50 for it, and as long as havers will
pay the advancing prices the price is
going up.
"It has gotten to be a joke. A seller
will offer a lot of butter or tggs at a
certain price, feeling that no one will
be foolish enough to pay that high,
and the first thing he knows his offer
ings arc accepted "

be authentic, brought to the border
by refugees.
Perigees further stale that the dis
trict between parral and Jimenez, has
been ilea led by Villa's followers of
more than L'UO Chines'.
The American killed at Jimenez was
described as about 110 years old. ami

j The same refugees, who claim to
'have been witnesses of the outrages,
j also say that two Mexican women who
'had married Chinese, and their five
j half caste children, were bound and
! thrown alive into the fire and cre-
mated in sight of the crowd. The
bodies of seven murdered Chinese, ac
cording to the same authority, were
seen m the streets of the town.
I Two Mexicans who escaped from
I Pa J:a I, partly by horse and partly
uroui, affirm that they saw four Amer
icans there under a Villa guard. They
said those men had lived in the town,
adding that they heard the Americans
working at the Alvarado mines got
away. Another report brought to the
border was to the effect that the
bodies of thirty-five gypsies of varied
ages and both sexes, were seen on Hie
roadside near Parral, murdered and
robbed by Villii bandits. The gypsies
were believed to be of Syrian origin.
Jups ami (rt-riiiaiis Spared.
All foreigneis that Villa has caught,
except the Japanese and Germans,
have been put to death, the reports
agree, and even the Germans are abl
to have suffered at hast in tho in
stance of Theodore Iloomiiller of Par
ral, who married a Mexican woman.
Various reports of Iloemuller's death
have been received here during tho
past week.
The Chinese are call'-d the heaviest
sufferers. The fact that none ure to
be seen 111 the district in which they
formerly did a largo niercjntile busi
ness, is taken by the refugees as proof
that all, numJiering over ffoo, met the
fate of the Chinese caught at Parral
and Jimenez.
