Wilson and for the next few weeks
will engage his attention and that of
his advisors to the practical exdu
Hion of nil bin the most urgent of
domestic subjects.

I no Hand Now!
From now on the president ex ee(
to deal with all foreign questions with
out embarrassment und he is receiving
from his advisors i summary e.f the
uutstantliiiK issues sir essential lo tak
ing stoel: of the basic situation which
must be met now that international
relations have returned to their place
of Importance. While It Is not evi
dent that there will be any funda
mental change in policy, freedom from
fear that any move at all would be
misinterpreted ns inspired by an in
ternal political struggle has been re
moved. President Wilson nnd Secre
tary Lansing feel themselves able to
. net with a single eye to the Inter
national situation and their Immedi
ate conferences on the president's re
turn to Washington indicate how
pressing they feel the situation to be.
Rig Problems l'p.
Tho president must decide how the
United States shall meet the Herman
submarine question on the one hand
and the entente allied trade restric
tions on the other, whe'.her the re
taliatory legislation shall be enforced,
whether tho traditional theory of Iso
lation shall be abandoned for con
certed neutral action, and whether the
country shall have an aggressive or
a passive policy toward the peace con
ference, the war after the war and
the permanent league to enforce peace
which the president has accepted in
theory. And, during the rest of the
war, shall America attitude be gov
erned bv a decided benevolence In the
Interpretation of International law, ac
cording to its own best Interests, or
shall It be strictly legalistic, regard

Complications Looming.
Most .pectueular and disquieting of
the problems Is the stibium ine ques

7 o'clock Sunday evening as the parly
was returning from a dnve and were
crossing the Katv railroad where t lie
highway intersects the Hacks, about
four miles southeast of Tulsa, near
the Hickory coal mines.
Uocause of a great cloud of dust
that had been stiired by a number of
cats passing that spot, young Wil
liams, who was unfamiliar w,lh the.
road, did not see the high embank

railroad ties had diiven the car too

Proceeding at a speed of probably

accompanied by W. K. Tcinpluinan, h

when the two men reached the ear
and were endeavoring to extricate the

Mrs. West and the oilier passenger
of the wrecked ear were placed in

where the street crosses the Midland
Valley railroad tracks, the fender of
tho car struck J. P. Wisdom, Ou, an
employe on the new post office buibi
ing, knocking him to the pavement.
The trout wheel ran over his left
ankle.
Wisdom was picked up, placed in
the same car and taken to the hos
pital with the injured woman, where
an X-ray examination was made of
the wnuudi d ankle and of the injured
arm of Mrs. West. It was announced
by the examining physician that Mrs.
West's injury consisted of a partial
fracture of the arm and slignt bruises
lo the side, which might later prove
to be Internal injuries, although it
was linpuHuible to ascertain llio exlent
of the injury nt that lime, while Wis

According to Mr. Andrews, who was

OKLAHOMA CITY. Nov. 10. Tho
si ssioti of the Republican state
central committee hero Monday prom
ises to be one of tht most interesting
that has been held for some tlmo.
The real purpose of the gathering
is to i n t 1 1 n ej a plan of action in refer
ence to a proposed contest In tho fair
election law results.
However, there are other matters
that may be Injecte I into tho meet
ing. For some time, there l.as been
cm sulci able dissatisfaction about the
conduct of Chairman Arthur flelssler.
It stems that hu has been unable to
harmonlc some small fiu-tiotis exist
ing In the parly since the Mcliraw
ilarrls conlest; and it Is reported
openly that the executive committee
Is not working In harmony with tile
present chairman.
Tin re has been some talk about John
I . Appleby causing a row because he
was demoied from the state secretary
ship, and it is well known Unit he
tried to cause dissension al the last
cominiltce meeting Just prior to the
election. It is not thought probable,
however, that he will piafve t0 he fac
tor enough to cause any serious trou
ble. There are many members of the
committee who will not stand for the
.removal of Mr. Kncelanil In favor of
I Mr. Appleby, and In case the in. liter
did eiiine to a clash, a third man will
I be selected as secretary.
It Is not altogether Imptobuble thai
the re will be many members of the
i eomiiiillee ill Oklahoma Clly who w ill
j be open in ilielr declaration that the
committee needs an entire leorganl
.atlon Including a new chairman, sec
I rotary and certain members of the
i xeentlv e roinmiiiee.
While some members of the com
mittee ami other prominent Kepublle
ails w ho have the welfaie of I he party
at heart are already ill Oklahoma City
loi klrg over the ground, there Is no
decided program laid out as yet, and
those here nre urging arty harmony.
