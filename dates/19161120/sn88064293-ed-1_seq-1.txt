WHO WILL BE NEXT CONTRIBUTOR?
Review Doll and Toy Fund Has Started to Grow and a
Splendid Sum Is In View
As you go through the business
districts of Morgan City you will
notice that many of the business
men have agreed to help in the great
work of raising the Doll and Toy
Fund. Whenever you are brought
face to face with one of those green
cards with red letters advising you
that the Doll and Toy Fund contribu
tions will be accepted at that place
just reach for your pocketbcok and
the proprietor or clerk will relieve
you of any little offering you wish
to make and see that your name an 1
the amount you subscribe is printed
in the list of the Morgan City Daily
Review. As there are only about
thirty of these Review Doll and Toy
Fund collecting agencies in the city
you can hardly fail to meet up with
one of them—and if /on see all of
them and wish to make thirty differ
ent contributions you will meet with
no objections. •
But dont put off too long your de
termination to help with the Ooil ami
Toy Fund. Better hand out your do
nation just as soon as you run
across a place where it will be ac
counted for. And make it your duty
to see that the other fellow comes
across with his bit. It's g dug to take
a lot of help to put a thousand dol
lars worth of toys in the delighted
laps of a couple of hundred little
old hicks who wont get it unless you
help. Of course, a thousand dollars
would be rather some fund and it is
merely mentioned to show that there
is no limit to the game and that you

REAL LIFE DRAMAS IN
"ROMEO AND JULIET'
A birth, a marriage and a death,
three of the vital happenings round
which most of the drama of human
life is woven, figured in reality dur
ing the making of the big screen
production of "Romeo and Juliet,"
in which Francis X. Bushman and
Beverly Bayne are stared.
While the Bushman-Bayne com
pany of more than six hundred play
ers were working in a scene in the
Italian city of Verona, erected on
the Brighton Beach race track, one
of the women in the crowd fell pros
trate in the street. She was removed
to a tent back of the street scenes,
where she gave birth to a baby boy.
She was Mrs. Rosanna Araza,
tw'enty-six years old, of Brooklyn.
She had the role of a fruit vendor,
and for the most part stood in front
of her stand in the recess of a
quaint building.
There were, perhaps, scores of
romances that had their beginnings
when the six hundred players met
and worked together for many days
and nights, but as far as known only
one friendship resulted in a wedding
during the making of a picture.
Jesse L. Guire, a student in the
Columbia University summer school,
obtained a position working as an
extra in the big scene in the
studio at night. He was working this
way through school, and the three
dollars he received each night, added
considerably to his purse.
j
can come in for just any amount you
wish.
Two dollars and fifty cents added
to the Review Doll and Toy Fund,
and more threatened. From here, it
looks like those little old mutts are
going to have some jollyfication
'long about Santa time. Now, who
will be the next to jar loose a small
sum for the kiddoes?
Out of a city of five thousand
people, surely there are one thous
and who will be glad to give some
thing to help toward making a happy
Christmas for the little, poor child
ren of Morgan City. Any little old
contribution from a thin dime to
century note will be accepted gladly,
and, you know, that every dollar
will be transformed into dolls and
toys wdth wisdom and discretion by
that famous organization of charita
ble workers, The King's Daughters.
Dont delay adding your name to
the list of contributors to the Doll
and Toy Fund. The fund is fairly
started now and the list is open to
you with the invitation to give just
as much or as little as you feel able
to give.

1 President Wilson made it plain
that he wants his next inauguration
to be a comparatively simple affair.
The Conference for Education and
Industry in the South decided upon
a big Chautauqua to be located in
some Southern city.
Secretary Baker undertook to
have the flood control bill placed a

French troops occupied Monastir

Justine Harcourt, a high school
girl, living in the Bronx with her
mother and three sisters, was an
other "extra." Justine, who had am
bitions to go on the stage as soon as
she finished school, induced her sis
jter to accompany her to the studio.
'There Justine met young Guire for
the first time. Four weeks after
their first meeting they were mar
ried.
The saddest chapter of this history
making feature was the death of
John Arthur, the man who wrote the
scenario and conceived the idea of
picturizing the great drama on a big
scale for the screen. Mr. Arthur lived
to see the big feature well under
way, and was present for several |
weeks when many of the important
scenes were photographed. But his
hope and ambition to see the com
pleted picture upon the screen were
not realized. He died suddenly of
acute indigestion in New r York hos
pital. Mr. Arthur was forty-four
years old. He was a graduate of the
Northwestern University, and for a
time was a member of the faculty
there.
