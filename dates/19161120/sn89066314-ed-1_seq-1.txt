COLUMBIA SOLDIERS
TO CTHOI BUHUbH
Letter From General Funston
Dispels nope ui an
Early Return.
MAYOR TO PROTEST
Commanding Officer Says He
Is Acting Fairly to All
of the States.
A letter received this morning by
Mayor J. M. Batterton from Major
General Frederick M. Funston seems
to indicate that there is little proba
bility of the early return of Columbia's
national guardsmen from the Mexican
border.
SeTeral business and professional
men of Columbia sent a telegram to
cotarv Baker of the War Depart-
I ment. Saturday asking that the matter
fol returning the Columbia men be tak
C . .. cnnn as Dossible. and giving
en up an -
as the reason for their request the
fact that most of the men are Univer
sity students or business men of Co
"inmbia. Secretary Baker replied on
the same day with a brief t telegram
stating that the choice of regiments
to be returned was entirely at the dls
,tinn of Major-General Funston and
that the Department was trying to be
lair in the matter.
The letter received this 'morning
was as follows:
"Your telegram of November 16 with
reference to return of the Second and
Fourth Missouri regiments is at hand.
In reply would say that your remarks
as to unjust discrimination against
them are uncalled for and without
foundation. Comparatively few regi
ments have so far been returned to
their home states. The question of
having fulfilled requirements does not
enter Into the problem. When t"je
War Department orders a number of
regiments to return t6 their home sta
tion, these orders are carried out.
Missouri has already had more than
herJSare'of regiments returned to
hoae stations, and my idea of Justice
ii that other states are entitled to
some consideration as well as Mis
souri." Mayor Batterton stated this morn
ing that he Is considering another let
ter to General Funston, explaining In
detail the peculiar circumstances of
the Columbia company and asking
that if possible they be returned by
the first of the year. The matter was
taken up, he said, not as an occasion
to find fault, but rather to bring the
attention of the War Department to
the wishes of the Columbia men and
their friends.

U. S. TO ALTER POLICY
Dilatory Tactics of Mexico
Force Administration to
Change Its Attitude., ,
By ROBERT J. BENDER
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. The Ad
ministration will accept little more
delay from the Mexican side of the
joint conference at Atlantic City. Pa
tience of the American authorities is
at a breaking point. The next few
days may bring unexpected develop
ments. The Mexicans will be told
emphatically. In language stripped of
diplomacy, that the United States can
not sit in the session if dilatory ob
structive tactics are continued. By
such means the Administration hopes
to reach & peaceful agreement.
The border patrol plan Is but part
of what this Government hopes to' ac
complish. Protection and safety of
American lives and property is the big
problem. If these and the border pa
trol problems are settled satisfactor
ily, new steps will be taken. The
United Press learned these facts from
trustworthy sources today.
What the altered course will be no
one would say. Wilson, Lansing, Lane
and Baker know what it is. However,
it is freely predicted by those close to
the Mexican problem that a shift in
policy will find us dealing more strict
ly with Mexico than in the past. The
significant part of the emphatic talk
proposed is that "Wilson approves it
and is backing his commissioners in
their plans to force an agreeable set
tlement. Attack on Chihuahua City Expected.
By 'United Press
EL PASO, Nov. 20. Some passen
ger train refugees reaching Juarez
last night about midnight enabled the
United States Government agents to
day to gain confirmation of the return
of General Trevino, Mexican defacto
commander, to Chihuahua iCity, after
marching his army out to open a cam
ma im acinar Villa. The train brought
about three hundred "'frightened na
tives, mostly women, to the border.
Trevino is pressing all able-bodied
men into his army. The civilians of
Chihuahua City expect a bandit at
tack upon the city at any time. Car-
ranza has issued a statement that the
five Americans at Parral are safe. One
woman, who claimed to have come
from there, said she saw four Ameri
cans taken along the street, but did
not know their fate.

MINEOLA HILLS PASS
BY 11CTI0N0F COURT
Montgomery County Has a
New Route To Avoid
Bad' Road. '
ENDS A 5-YEAR FIGHT
Change Will Mean Much
.Cross-State Traffic for
Columbia.
The Mineola Hills, whose reputa
tion as being tbe worst stretch of road
on the Old Trails Route has been re
sponsible for diverting traffic from the
highway, are to be elmlnated. The
hills are in Montgomery County, ihe
Montgomery County Court met Satur
day to make final plans for changing
the location of the road. Mineola
Springs has been fighting for the
change for five years.
The following letter received today
by Dr. J. B. Cole, chairman of the Old
Trails Committee for Columbia, should
be of unusual interest to Columbia and
Boone County, according to Doctor
Cole.
"Mineola, Mo., Nov. 20, 1916. Dr. J.
B, Cole, Columbia. Tell all the boys
at, Columbia that we have at last se
cured the Kurlach route to build the
Old Trails Road. ' Will be up in a few
days and tell you all about it. Very
truly, J. S. Gregory."
"This will complete the Old Trails
Road in Missouri," said Dr. Cole." It
will bring a larger portion of cross
state travel through Columbia, and
will mean nearly as much to the city
as the building of the Daniel Boone
Tavern."
Dr. Cole says he expects to see rapid
improvements along the entire route
now since the trail has been made
complete betw een Kansas City and St.
Louis.
DOCTOR TESTIFIES FOR STATE

By United Press
ST. JOSEPH, Nov. 20. The state

down the defense of Oscar McDaniel,
prosecuting attorney of Buchanan
County, that burglars, or someone try
ing to wreak revenge, murdered his

of the hearing today, with the court
room more crowded than Saturday,
the state called Dr. A. G. McGlothlan,
one of the physicians who assisted in
the autopsy on Mrs. McDaniel's body,
after first having attempted to recall
the acting coroner.
'McGlothlan testified that no evi
dence of any sort was found to show
that Mrs. McDaniel's rings were tak
en by someone who hurriedly ripped
them from her fingers. He said there
were no marks on the hand that had
the rings. --

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. Th cur

most gigantic industrial tattles in the
nation's history when the Joint Inter

'Representatives of commercial or

SHOES. MAY COST $20 A PAISV
X
Local Dealers 'gay Price I Rfoisff
Steadily.
For one pair of shoes, $15 to $20!
Shoe manufacturers are predicting
this price if the war continues until
Spring, according to local dealers.
Three managers of shoe stores were
questioned today regarding the steady
advance in the prices of shoes and
each said that the cost of making
shoes was increasing daily.. All at
tributed the skyward tendency to the
scarcity of leather, due to the war.
"The manufacturers are refusing to
quote prices or guarantee deliveries,"
said C. B. Miller, as he showed a let
ter announcing an increase of sixty
cents a pair. "Such notices are com
ing in every day. The scarcity of
leather is becoming serious. Russia,
formerly the source of a big supply,
has been cut off entirely since the war
began, and both North and South
America have been sending large
quantities of leather to Europe for
war use. Last year the United States
sent 5,000,000 pairs of shoes to Eu
rope. "But, despite the Increased price of
shoes, we Americans should be thank
ful that we do not live in Russia. A
pair of shoes recently sold by our
store were sent to Russia, where they
brought $40."
Mr. Miller believes the introduction
of rubber into general use will have
only a slight effect on the prices of
shoes.
