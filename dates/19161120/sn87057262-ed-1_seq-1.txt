RAILROADS AND LABOR
American Federation of Labor Has
Sent Out its Challenge Against
Legislation on
Strikes.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, D. C.. Nov. 20.—
The curtain lifted here on one of the
most dramatic battles of industrial
units in me nation's history today.
The Joint committee of the interstate
commerce commission started its in
vestigation of conditions relative to
interstate and foreign commerce and
necessity for fuither regulation along
the lines of the Adamson eight hour
law and to nearly all Interstate pub
lic utilities.
Represented In the light are com*
mercial organizations of all kinds and
from all over the country, great
manufacturing corporations and in
dustries. Every influence of capital
and labor wlU clash during the hear
ings.
The railroads' fight will be directed
by the railway executive, advisory
commission of which Frank Trum
bull, chairman of the Chesapeake and
Ohio, is the head. The brotherhood*
will have their four chiefs—Sto^io, o'
the engineers Carter, of the llitir.en
Lee, of thetrainmen, and Shpeard, of
the conductors, all of whom are now
in the city ready to work. Bach side
is armed with statistics to support
contentions that have been made for
years.
"The public Is the interest most to
be considered in this controversy,"
Jtadge Adamson, vice chairman of the
joint congressional committee and
parent of the eight. hour law said to
day. "Both the railways and the
brotherhoods neem for the moment to
I forget that they are our servants In
this matter."
"During the day. Judge Adamson
will confer with President Wilson on
the question of putting through con
gress the legislation the president
has proposed for settlement and pre
vention of industrial disputes. The
American Federation of Labor has
already sent out its challenge on
such legislation—voicing a determi
nation to oppose any legislation
which will limit the strike right of
labor.
The committee spent its morning
session classifying those who will be
heard. This afternoon an executive
session was held.
Some surprise was occasioned when,
railway labor heads failed to ask rep
resentation. The brotherhood chiefs
may later ma'ce application to be
heard.
Capital, represented by a mlgh.y
list of railway presidents and heaJs
of commercial organizations, served
notice that it wants full hearing.
The main contentions of this group, it
was announced, will be opposition to
government ownership of public utili
ties and support of federal control.
Representatives of state railway
commissions announced they will
flght any attertipt to wrest control
from them.

WITH THE CANADIAN FORCES
ON TOTE SOMiME, Nov. 20.—This Is
the story of the storming of Reglna
trench—as told by a sergeant In a
Canadian infantry regiment who was
one of the etormers.
With a slight scaln wound from a
sniper's bullet, whioh had torn a
huge hole in the steel helmet which
he was still wearing, and another
wound in his shoulder, from a shrap
nel bullet, he was "evacuating" him
self to a dressing station when I en
countered him. It was on the morn
ing after the Canadians had ousted
the Germans from their stretch of
trench.
Mud from the toes of his hip hoots
to his very eyes, and with a streak of
blood on one side of his face, the
sargeant nevertheless, made light of
his wounds. He smiled as he re
sponded to questions.
'It was a good fair scrap and the
best man won," he explained, speak
ing with a typical Irish-American ac
cent. interlarded with American
slang.
"We got the tip at 10 o'clock Fri
day night that something would be
doing about midnight. Everybody
was tickled because we'd been hank
ering to get at that Regina trench
for the past two weeks.
"Our artillery hit it up hotter and
hotter and we could see by the bril
liant moonlight that it was doing big
damage to Fritz in the trenches a
few hundreds yards in front of us.
At midnight, our artillery formed a
barrage fifty yards in front of us—
and our first wave went over the
parapet of our trenches like a ma
chine.
"Not a son hobbled. My hardest
Job was keeping my men from ad
vancing too fast and getting under
our own shell fire. Also it was
pretty hard to keep the waves of
men straight on account of the crat
ers and slTell holes of various depth
of mud.
"But when we got within fifty
yards of Reglna trench, we formed a
pretty straight line. About thi9
time the Germans started their bar
rage fire too—but they did little
damage, the fire mostly going over
our heads. As soon as our barrage
lifted off Reglna to a point fifty
yards back, we stormed through.
•The boches scrapped pretty well.
It seemed strange that anybody could
have been left alive after all the
shelling they'd had, but thay bobbed spaired of saving her life.

BTORLIN, Nov. 20.—The German
public regards skepttcallly so far as Im
mediate action is concerned. Washing
ton reports via Switzerland and Lon
don that President Wilson may soon
take some kind- of steps for peace.
The government Itself Is having noth
ing to do with the peace talk nor Is
the army. The army is concentrating
its efforts toward winning. The gen
eral attitude toward American Ambas
sador Gerard Is changing. He will
probably find himself more popular
when he returns than he was six
months ago. There is a seemingly
well founded report here that before
Gerard departed, officials asked him
to return, even in the event of Presi
dent Wilson's defeat and remain as
long as possible.
But as far as the general public is
concerned, the reports of peace steps
are causing universal discussion.
The growth of sentiment for an In

(German newspaers to obtain from

EL PASO, Texas, Nov.
20.—From
the passengers of a refugee train
reaching Juarez at midnight last
night, United States government
agents obtained confirmation of the
return of General Trevino, Mexican
defacto commander, to Chihuahua
City, after marching Ms army out to
o^en a campaign against Villa.
The train brought thre,e hundred
(frightened natives, many of them
women, to the border. Trevino Is im
pressing all able bodied men Into
his army, the natives said, and the
civil population of Chihuahua City Is
momentarily expecting a bandit at
tack upon the city.
One woman told of seeing the body j,ruuance
of a gray haired American lying in
front of the Jlmlnez hotel In Jimlnez.
It Is believed here the body was that
of Dr. Fisher. Another woman who
claimed to have come from Parral,
said she saw four American prison
ers being taken along the streetB by
bandits, but does not know their fate.
A seqpi-offlcial report wired from
Carranzlsta military headquarters at
Chihuahua City, stated that all
Americans in Parral fled the town
upon the advice of General Luis
Herrera, Carransiata commander
there. Many other conflicting reports
are reaching the border concerning
the fate of the five Americana who
did not leave with the party of Alvar
ado mining men.
Despite efforts of the, Alvarado
mining company to get further par
ticulars of the arrival of the five
Americans at Cullcian on the weBt
coast, company officials have been un
able to get any replies to five tele
grams and tracers addressed to Su
