Sheriff Has Warrant
For discarding his wife and two
children and eloping with iMiss Annie
Balzer, the 15-year-old daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Michael Balzer of this
city, a warrant was sworn to late
yesterday afternoon in Judge Dolan's
court for the arrest of Albert E. Mar­
quette, son of A. F. Marquette, pro­
prietor of the Bismarck Steam laun­
dry. The specific charge was kidnap­
ing.
Mil Be 16 in January.
Miss Annie Balzer, who will be 16
years of age this ccming January,
took a position at the Bismarck
Steam laundry six months ago. She
operated one ot' the mangling ma­
chines.
Albert E.- Marquette, son of the
owner of the laundry, and also one
of the employes, cast frequent glances
at Miss Balzer. Love sparks (began
to fly. Saturday night was pay day.
Spark3 kindled into a fire which
burst into a conflagration that night,
when it was reported that the son
of the proprietor of the steam laun­
dry had eloped with the girl on train
No. 2.
Girl's Father Swears to Warrant.
Michael Halzer yesterday afternoon
appeared before Judge Dolan and
swore to the warrant. The charge, it
was stated, will be dismissed, and
one of a deeper and more serious na­
ture preferred if it is learned that
the couple were married. .The war­
rant was placed in the hands of 'Sher­
iff French, who stated this afternoon
that there is no clue to their where­
abouts as yet.
Eloper Married Four Years.
Marquette, according to the story
told by the father this afternoou. had
been married four years and was liv­
ing with his wife at her home, that of
Mary Pinks, SI 7 Thirteenth street
north. His wife's maiden name was
Lena Pinks.
The two had not ibeen living to­
gether for the past three months.
She would call at the Bismarck Steam
laundry every week and get five dol­
lars of his pay. Early in the week
she called and was given ten dollars.
When -Marquette drew his pay ho had
only ten dollars coining. Because of
this fact and the little pay that. 'Miss
Balzer received, it is believed that
they have not gone very far.
Scoffs Marriage Theory.
A. F. Marquette, father of the young
man. scoffed the theory this after­
noon that they were married. He
stated that Albert has not been di­
vorced, but that he and his wife have
'been having domestic troubles and
hat in his opinion his son left in or­
der to get out of his wife's way.

About an inch of snow lay on tho
ground at noon, with, the air clear.

(Associated «Press.
Washington, Nov. 20.—A portentous
and complicated international situa­
tion now faces President Wilson and
for the next few weeks win engage
his attention and. that of his advisers
to the practical exclusion of all be
the most urgent subjects.
In the last days of the campaign,
Secretary of State Lansing frequently
spoke of the necessity of postponing
action on the mora lelicatc. interna­
tional questions because the uncer­
tainty of the outcome ol' the political
contest had a direct bearing on the
success or failure of Some of the ad­
ministration's policies.
Without Embarrassment.
From now on the president expects
to deal with all foreign questions
without embarrassment and he is re­
ceiving from his advisers a summary
of the outstanding issues so essential
to taking stocW of the basic situation
which must be met' Aow that interna­
tional relations haVe returned to their
place of prime importance. While it
is riot evident that there will be any
fundamental change, freedom from
fear that any move at all would be
misinterpreted as inspired bv an in­
ternal political struggle has been re­
moved. President Wilson and Secre­
tary Lansing feel themselves able
to act with a single eye to the inter­
national situation and their immedi­
ate conferences on fhBTJresidont's re­
turn to Washington indicate how
pressing they feel the situation to be.
Many Problems.
The president, must decide bow the
United States shall meet, the (Ionian
submarine question on the. pne band
and the Entente Allied tratio restric­
tions on the other, whether the retali­
atory legislation shall be enforced,
whether the traditional theory of iso
Jatlon shall be abandoned for concert­
ed neutral action, and whether the
country shall have an aggressive or
a passive policy toward the peace con­
ference after the war, and the perma­
nent league to enforce peace v/hich
the president has accepted in theory.
And, during the rest of the war, shall
America's attitude bo governed by a
decided benevolence in the interpreta­
tion of international law according
to its own best interests, or shall it
be strictly legalistic, regardless of
whom it affects?

MACEDONIAN CITY III KANDS
OF ENTENTE AND TEUT
SO FAR AS
Plenty of lignite Being Sold at
Same Old Prices in Central
North Dakota
WASHBURN COMPANY CAN
SUPPLY 500,000 TONS
The much talked of coal shortage
is a myth, so far as the Capital City
and central North Dakota are con­
cerned.
Not only is there plenty of coal in
Bismarck, but it is selling at the same
iprices which prevailed last year—•
the ton. It may go up 25 cents
the first of December, but not more.
And the supply this year is just
twice as great as it was last.
Lignite Comes Into Own.
This refers especially to the once
despised lignite. Lignite has been a
prophet not without honor except in
its own country. Where best known
the facetious have been prone to style
it "Lug-all-night" and to look down
upon it, principally because it' was a
local product and cheap. Now, how­
ever, with imported coals soaring out
of sight, and impossible even at in­
visible pripes, central North Dakota
turns to lignite as a savior.
Has Doubled Capacity.
Tho Washburn Lignite Coal com.
pany, operating the largest and best
equipped lignite mine in North Da­
kota, at WSlton, just 28 miles north,
doubled its capacity during the past
summer by opening a second shaft
and installing a new all-steel tipple,
at a cost of $40,WK. This places the
Washburn company in a petition to
produce all the way from 250,000 tons
to 500,000 tons this year, depending
upon the number of miners its is able
to employ. A |uarter-million tons
will go a long way toward relieving
tho coal fa-nine in this immediate
vicinity, and from this point west to
",p Monona line, south to the South
Dakota line, and north to the Domin­
ion, there is no lack of lignite nor of
mines with which to supply the con
Lamer,
Boost in Foreign Coals.
Foreign coals have advanced in
price locally from 10 to U5 per cent
over 1915 prices. Wyoming coal is
selling for $8 Montana, $!) and $10,
and anthracite from $14 to $15. These
prices are good only from day to day,
dealers state. No quotations can be
obtained from the mines on future
deliveries. In fact, there is no cer­
tainty that any coal can he had at
any certain time in the future. For
live weeks earlier in the season one
large local dealer succeeded in secur­
ing but one carload of coal. The
shortage in cars has been relieved to
a great extent, however, and this dif­
ficulty may not again be encountered.

Powers.

tion the brilliancy of General
Sen-ail's drive and doubt, seems to
be expressed whether the Teutons
can escape the encircling move­
ment.
Uncomfortable Position.
Monastir is likely to be an uncom­
fortable place for,the allies, as the new
Bulgarian-German positions command
the town and early efforts will bo
made to re-occupy the city by a vig
orous offensive.
I Various considerations urged that
the town immediately be stormed not
I only because its occupation would givo
the Serbian government a local habi­
tation on the soil of its fatherland, but
also because General Sarrail, com­
mander of the Entente operations in
the Balkans, would be encouraged to
use it as a base for further operations.
Sl\ift Burden.
The evacuation of Monastir will in
a way shift the operative difficulties
from the Bulgar-Teuton army to Gen­
eral Sarrail's shoulders.
The allied forces had the distinct ad­
vantage of operating at the end of the
Monastir-Salonika railway and also
possessed a good network of military
roads in the rear.
Not a Surprise.
The Macedonia town of Monastir
was evacuated during the night by
German and Bulgarian troops vho re­
tired to prepared positions further
north. They thus withdrew from high­
ly unfavorable positions in the plain
where they were icxpored to artillery
fire from heights to the south and
southeast of the towns. News of the
evacuation of Mor.astir does not copio
as a surprise. Located at the bottom
of a bowl, it is sui rounded on all sides
by dominating heights. Therefore tac­
tically unfavorable, as soon as the en­
emy forces gained footing on the rim
of "the bovl, as already was done to
the south, less than five miles from tho
town. Since opening the campaign in
the Roumanian theater, which is re­
garded here as the decisive theater of
the whole war front, it was considered
a correct decision strategically and
tactically not to call on the defenders
for heavy sacrifices and efforts to hold,
the town itself.
The Entente armies re-occupied
Monastir after protracted assault. The
Germans evacuated it during the night,
