Untold Horrors of Parral
Women Cremated Alive
WOMAN WKJS
(By Associated Press.) .
EL rASOr Nov. 20. An unidenti
fied American was killed when a
Villa bandit took sin-Inez and four
Americans were seen under a guard
of bandits at Parral during Villa's
occupation of that town, according to
reports believed by federal agents to
be authentic, brought to the border
by refugees.
It is further stated that the district
between Parral and Jiminez hag been
cleared by Villa's followers of more
than two hundred Chinese.
The' American killed at Jiminez
was described' as about sixty years
old and known to be from Torreon
on his way to Chihuahua City. He
was murdered, said the refugees, in
the Jiminez hotel, and his body lay
for some time in front of the build
ing, when, after being robbed of
clothing and valuables, it was placed
on a bonfire.
The same refugees who claimed to
have been witnesses of the outrages
also say that two Mexican women
who had married Chinese and their
five half-caste children, were found
and thrown alive Into the fire and
cremated in sight of the crowd. The
bodies of seven murdered Chinese,
according to the same authority, were
seen in the streets of the town.
Two Mexicans who escaped from
Parral affirm that they saw four
Americans there undera Villa guard.
They said these men had lived in the
town, adding that they, heard the
Americans working at the Alvarado
mines got away. Another report
brought to the border was to the
effect that the bodies of 35 gypsies
of both sexes were seen on the road
near Parral, murdered and robbed by
Villa bandits. The gypsies were be
lieved to be of Syrian origin.
All foreigners that Villa has caught
except the Japanese and Germans
have been put to death, the reports
agree, and even the Germans are said
to have suffered, at least in the in
stance of Theodore Homuller of Parral.
The Chinese are called the heaviest
sufferers. The fact that none Is to
be seen In the district in which they
formerly did a large mercantile busi
ness is taken by the refugees as
proof that all, numbering over 200,
met the fate of the Chinese caught
at Parral and Jiminez.
