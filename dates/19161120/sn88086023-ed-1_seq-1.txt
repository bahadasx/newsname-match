an infantry sergeant described it. The
sergeant was mud from his feet to
his eyes and had a blood streaked
face. He was wounded on the head
and shoulder. He spoke with an Irish
American accent.
"It was a good, fair scrap. The best
man won. We got a tip Friday night
there would be something doing at
midnight. Everybody was tickled as
tly were hankering to get the Re
gina trenche. Artillerying became
hotter and hotter. The moonlight re
vealed the damaged Friti: trenches.
At midnight we crossed the parapets.
We had the hardest Job in keeping
the men from advancing too far and
getting under our own shellfire. It
wag difficult to keep ranks straight
on account of the men falling into the
muddy shell craters. We kept a pret
ty straight line until within fifty
yards of the Reia trenches. The
Bosches scrapped well. It seemed
strange anybody would be alive after
the shelling. They bobbed from their
dugouts like rabbits. We used bayo
nets. "We cleared a trench In a few sec
onds, taking prisoners. Three Ger
mans in one section were especially
troublesome. We told them they'd
better behave or we'd be obliged to
finish them. Two behaved but one
kept jumping about in the full moon-

taken there. We took no machines as
the Prussians frequently blew them
selves up with their captors."
