A careful and 'courteously-worded
yet pointed criticism of Hawaii's nor

The letter, signed by the officers of

Paper money may soon come into
almost as common use in Hawaii as

There is being imported currency to
the value of approximately $2,000,000
which may be expected to soon ap

Payment of a sum estimated at over
$4,000,000 by the plantation companies
to their laborers presented a number
of serious problems to companies and
to the banks of the territory. In or
der to relieve the pressure that must
fall upon the banking houses as the
distributing agents in the payments
of the great sums that are to be paid,
it was agreed that the payments
should not be made at one time , and

NATIONAL GUARD CAMP, RED
HILL, Nov. 20. The annual week's
encampment of the 1st Regiment, N.
G. H.. began Sunday and is the largest
in point of attendance of any previous
year. Without a hitch the regiment
marched from the armory to the camp-!
ing place on Red Hill, and so carefully
was everything worked, out ' before
hand that shortly after noon camp
was made and the life in camp was
running as smoothly as if it was an
everyday occurrence with the guards
men.;: : i :- ' "
Order of March .
Sharply at 8:30, the time set for
the start, the bugles sounded "Fore
ward, march!" and headed by the
mounted orderlies, headquarters com
pany, supply company and musicians,
the men began their six-mile march
to Red Hill, which they reached a few
minutes after 11 o'clock and almost
immediately tents began to go up
oyer the hillside. Following the lead
ing organizations came the Machine
Gun Company and it was followed by
Companies A to I and K to M and the
Hospital Corps and Engineers' Com
pany respectively brought up the rear.
The" supply wagons had gone on ahead,
but before the camp was reached they
had been passed by the marching men.
A day could not have been ordered
by headquarters which was better
than Sunday. A warm, drying sun, a
cloudless sky and a refreshing breeze
made the march ideal and all the men
arrived at the camp in fine condi
tion and went about their duties as if
a long morning's march was nothing
out of the ordinary. The Hospital
Corps at the rear had nothing to do
and the enly dead soldiers along the
road were the pop bottles and their
mortality was terrible. According to
officers, the discipline was all that
could be asked. In fact, it greatly
surprised the regular array officers
who were in attendance.
Make Camp Immediately
Shortly after the men arrived at
the camp the supply wagons drove in
and soon the tents were going up.
and almost before it could be realized
Company streets were quickly laid out
the hill was dotted with yellow tents
and a soldier city had suddenly sprung
into existence. Red Hill is a fine
place lor a camp as it is covered with
a thick carpet of grass and if rains
occur before the encampment is over
mud, the terror of every soldier, will
not greatly trouble Honolulu's citizen
soldiers.
First Meas Served
At 1 o'clock the bugles sounded
lunch, or mess as it is known here,
and everybody was certainly ready.
Quickly the different companies were

drawn up into line and each with his
dish, cup and knife, fork and spoon
marched to the mess tent, where he
was generously supplied with beef
stew, soup and bread. The evening
meal consisted of roast beef, tomatc
souffle, rice, coffee and, bread. ''...While
the food is plain it is cooked exceed
ingly well and there is always plenty
of it. Although it is real camp life
in every sense of the) word, clealiness
is 6trictly enforced and any offender
will be eourtmartialed. It is the hope
of the officers in command to return
without a single man having been sick
and to that end efforts are directed.
After the noonday meal the men
were detailed off in squads and the
work of putting the camp into ship
shape condition proceded until ' the
bugle called to muster at 3 o'clock.
This took up an hour's time and then
the guardsmen returned to work and
when they were called to supper the
