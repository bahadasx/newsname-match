Twenty Thousand More Turned
Away From Tabernacle
TOPIC WAS "BROKEN ALTARS"
Evangelist Says Many Preachers Fail
Because They Fear to Be
Sensational.
Boston, Nov. IS. "Billy" Sunday
preached to three capacity audience
today. More than 51,000 people at
tended the meetings and about 20,000
were turned away for lack of room.
It was the' greatest day so far in the
Boston campaign. "Broken altars,"
"Billy's" new sermon, was the sub
ject at the morning service. The af
ternoon sermon was taken from the
text of II Timothy, li: 15. For the
evening sermon the baseball evange
list spoke on "Deliver the goods."
In his morning sermon M. Sunday
said that too many preachers were
alraid of being sensational. He said
that preachers should be outspoken
and say what they believed no mat
ter whose feelings might be hurt. The
evangelist criticized the Unitarians,
Universalists and Christian scientists
at the afternoon meeting.
Mr. Sunday said in part at the mom
lng meeting: "Seek first the king
dom of God and his righteousness, as
much in force today as it was 2000
years ago, and the man who does it
will have a stirring time and make
the devil lots of trouble. There was
nothing so much needed in Israel's
sweeping revival, and God sent lie
right man to the front to bring it
about. Let us see how he proceeded to
do it. First, I call to your attention
that fact that he did his work in a
way that was natural and unconven
tional. He had the backbone to be
himself. He wasn't piped down and
dominated by the personality of some
other man. He didn't ape anybody's
peculiarities or eccentricities. He had
some of his own, and had the courage
to keep them and use them for all
they were worth, and the preacher
who is afraid to be like him in this
respect will be as weak in his minis
try as Samson was after his haircut.
"When God calls a man to preach
he expects him to do it as naturally
as he sneezes or coughs or snores.
His own individuality is to hlni what
the steel frame is to the skyscraper,
and when he surrenders it In vain en
deaver to be like some one else, down
goes his ministerial meathouse. He
has failed to become the bright and
shining light he might have been, and
so his candlestick Is taken away from
him. Many preachers have a bar
ren ministry because they lose the
power of their personality by imitat
ing some one who has been success
ful. "A lot of us, too, are afraid of do
ing anything sensational. 1 have no
more patience with such than I have
with a horse that shies at a wheel
barrow, or a woman who goes into
hysterics at the itght of a mouse.
Study the chapter of the text and you
will discover that about everything
the Carmelite did was sensational,
and it was because of this that he
woke up the whole country. If shut
ting off the rainfall for three years
wasn't sensational nothing ever was.
It raised the biggest stir the country
had ever known and made Ahab and
Jezebel mad enough to bit them
selves. '
"It you don't want to see a dead
town or a dead church, wake up,
don't be afraid of doing something out
of the common. There is plentf of
illible warrant for not pushing things
aside just because they may happen
to be a little sensational. It was
sensational when Noah built the ark
and loaded it with its strange cargo,
and it was sensational when Jonah
went through the streets of Nineveh,
covered with dried seaweed, and grap
hically told the story of his three
days' experience In the belly of the
whale.
"The first timo Jesus went Into a
synagog after beginning his mlnstry,
he created a big sensation by teach
ing not as the scribes, but as one
having authority. The preacher who
cannot teach as one having authority
has no call from God to teach at all.
Head the 23d chapter or Matthew and
you will find sensational preaching,
every sentence of which cuts like a
razor. And then look at Pentecost
Can you imagine anything more sen
sational than what was said and done
in Jerusalem that day. Note, too,
how sensational John the Baptist, was
in what he was and what he said and
did. No doubt it was because he was
not one of a bunch that "all Jerusa
lem went out to hear him."
'"Why don't people go to church?'
Is a great question that is always be
ing asked. My guess is. that it is

EIOHTHOURS A
Y
FOR ALL RAILWAY
WORKERS
Brotherhoods Seek Extension of
Adamson Law Provisions
LEADERS MEET IN WASHINGTON
Monster Petition Going to Congress
Asking That Law Be Amended or
Repealed.
Washington, Nov. 19. First steps
in a movement to secure an extension
of the eight hour day to all classes
of organized railroad workers were
taken here today when the leaders of
the four railroad brotherhoods met
with representatives of the other or
ganization of the railroad workers
affiliated with the American Federa
tion of Labor und formed a working
alliance.
This action, lollowing immediately
the arrival in this city of the brother
hood chiefs who last summer brought
about the passage of the Adamson
law, gives a still more serious aspect
to the genet al railroad labor situation
i and seems to forshadow a struggle of
I' even larger proportions than that
which the Adamson law averted last
summer. That the President and
Congress are to have their hands full
i with this matter is not doubted here
now.
I When the Adamson law was up fov
discussion a petition was circulated
r among the railroad men not members
! of the brotherhoods protesting against
the proposed law as doing a grave In
justice to this class of railroad work
ers, who, it was contended, must suf
fer at the expense of the men whose
wages were to be laiscd by the law.
These petitions received little at
tention either from the President or
the men entrusted with putting
. through his railroad legislation.
1 Since the passage of the act, however,
the movement has assumed even larg
er proportions. A monster petition
is now on its way to Congross asking
that the' Adamson law be extended
to take in all classes of railroad men,
totalling 2.000,000 workers, or else be
repealed. The brotherhoods have
400,000 members.

Beside the note on the table was $102
which Beaura left to defray the fun
eral expenses.
