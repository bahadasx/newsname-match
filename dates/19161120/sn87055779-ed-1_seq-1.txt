President Will

International Newn Servl'':
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. Pres't
Wibson's first step toward entering
the controversy that has broken out
anew between railroads and em
ployes over the eight-hour day, was
taken this afternoon when he agreed
to meet the leaders of the four bi
railroad brotherhoods at 6:43
o'clock.
W. G. Lee of the trainmen, W. S.
Carter of the firemen, Warren S.
Stone of the engineers, and L. tf.
Shepard. representing C. F. Garri
son of the conductors, will go to the
white house. They are expected to
tell the president very frankly what
they intend dolnjr if the railroads
succeed in having the AJamson
eiKht-hour law declared unconsti
tutional. Delegates at Federation of
Labor Convention Di
vided on Question.
I iitern.i i'otial News Service:
liALTIilOUK, Md., Nov. So. A
well defined split over the proposed
endorsement of a universal eiht
huur working day appeared today
in the American Federation of Ia
bor convention while the delegates
awaited the coming of the railroad
brotherhood chiefs. For the first
time in two decades leaders of the
so-called radical element of the
federation claim to have enough
power to beat Ires't Samuel Gornp
ers on the rloor, and to carry, over
his protest, a resolution declaring
llatly and unequivocally for an eiht
hour day for all workers by means
of national legislation.
The garment workers, miners and
machinists three of the most pow
erful organizations atliliated with
the federation are presenting a
solid front on the eight-hour con
troversy. Opposed to them are the
.s-called conservatives, headed by
Gompers and his administration,
who, while wanting an eipht-hour
day. do not want it to come by na
tional legislation. They claim that
if congress can pas an eight-hour
law. it can just as well in the future
decree that 10 hours shall be the
standard day's work.
Action, however, is not looked
for until the brotherhood chiefs
hae had a chance to address the
delegates, which probably wil? be
tomorrow .
The convention spent a quiet
forenoon with routine business. A
resolution was adopted favoring na
tional legbiition to relieve insan
itary housing in tenement districts
through national loans to the work
ers. It was proposed to operate the
relief measure after the manner of
the rural credits bill. The conven
tion then recessed to allow the com
mittees to catch up in their v.ork.
