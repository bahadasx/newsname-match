Villisca and Blue Island Murders.
[By a Staff Correspondent.]
Red Oak, Novi 20.—Tho akein of
evidence ^rhlch J. N. Wilkerson, the
Burns detective of Kansas City, un
raveled In his search for U»e. perpetra
tors jt the Villisca ax mi/rders of 1912
when Joe Moore, his wife, four'fchil
dren, and tljp two little daughters of
Mr. and Mrs. Joe Stllllnger. were killed
In their beds with an ax, commenced
to be unwound in 4'8Mot court here
today before Judge Rockafellow, ,who
is hearing the slander suit of Senator
F. F. Jones of Villisca against Wilker
son in which he claims $60,000 as dam
ages for rumors and stories set afloat
by the detective, connectirtg his name
as "an accomplice in that atrocious
crime. ^The caie in»chlef of the plain
tiff, which was closed Friday after
noon, brought testimony before the
jury trom witnesses, who attended
meetings addressed by Wilkerson arid
who said that he made statements at
those-meetings, that "F. F. Jones fur
nished the money to pay for the mur
der of Joe Moore."
Thorp Meets Mansfield.
R. H. Thorp, formerly of Shenan
doah, but now living at Jefferson, was
the first witness to be heard in the
present trial tending to connect Wil
liam Mansfield with the Villisca mur
der. Thorp testified that on the Mon
day morning the Meore murder was
discovered in Villisca, he had left
Shenandoali at 10:40 o'clock for New
Market, His train, he said, got Into
Clarmda about noon, where it wait
ed twenty minutes for dinner. 'When
he left Shenandoah, Thorp declared he
had heard nothing of the tragedy in
Villisca, and "did hot learn anything of
it until he got to Clarinda. Here, he
said, he was the sole occupant of the
smoking car when two men got on the
train, and came into the car in which
he' was sitting, one coming in at each
door. The men got on from the side,
opposite the depot, he said.
One of the men, the witness con
tinued, walked' back to where he was
sitting ami- asked him- for a match.
"YoM're ^pretty nervous," Thorp said
he remarifMtrta' the man and asked
him to sit "down h«sid® him.
Did you hear of that murder at
Villisca?" Thorp said the man asked
of him, going on to tell him that there
was a family of eight killed the night
before.: Thorp said he asked the
stranger what the family's name was
and he told him it was Moore. Thorp
then declaxe'd that the stranger went
on to tell him that he and his com
panion were In Villisca last night, that
the town was in a,great commotion
and that they had come away early la
the morning because they didn't think
it was safe for a stranger to be caught
there.
Asked About Bloodhounds.
"Do you think bloodhounds can track
a man?" Thorp said the man asked of
him.
"I said, yes, I thought they could
°bt*eailse I had helped track a man once
In Indiana." Thorp..jald he replied to
the question.
"What #|d ypu observe these men-do
as the trtim approached the depot in
•jiffiSil&tfg g$\fhe -aide-
Ite th^dtepotis they'got off on .the
opposite sldfc I then .watched them
walk down the track," Thorpr: respond
ed.
Thorp said that during the journey
to New Market, he had played one
game of pitch with the stranger but
that he was too nervous to play more
tha'n one game, the cards dropping
from his hands.
"Up untif the time that this gentle
man spoke to you about the tragedy,
had yoil heard a word about it?" ask
ed Wilkerson's attorney.
"Not a thing," Thorp replied.
When he,"got to New Market, Thorp
said the town was in great commotion
over the news of wtyit had happened
at Villisca.
Identified Mansfield.
Thorp tesiined that last summer he
came to Re^ Oak and saw William
Mansfield, then in the. custody of Sher
iff Jackson of Montgomery county as
a suspect In the Villisca murder case.
"Was the man you saw here as
Mansfield in the custody of the sheriff,
the man you rode with from Clarinda
to New Market?" asked Wilkerson's
counsel from Thorp.
"He's the same man," the witness
replied, declaring ,that ^one of the
means by whiclr he identified him was
a scar on his neck which he had no
ticed the morning he rode with him
on the train. Thorp also identified
Mansfield from a picture.
Attorney Beeson of Jones' counsel
argued at great length to exclude
Thorp's testimony until its compe
tency had been established, holding
that there had yet been shown to be no
connection between the two men whom
thorp said- he rode on the train with
from Clarinda to New MdrketC and
Senator F. F. Jones.
He argued thai its admission would
only tend to. poieonydlnd prejudice the
jury if the existence of no conspiracy
was shown by the defendant. Attorney
Mitchell replied that he was seeking
flrst to show that Mansfield commit
ted. the murder uid would then seek
to establish the faoT of a conspiracy
involving Senator Jones^ "If we estab
lish the fact that Bill Mansfield wield
ed the ax that killed' Joe Moore and
fall to bring out a-conspiracy showing
Senator Jones to have been an accom
plice ,then Senator/Jones has been
rfo more harmed than you or I," de
clared Mitchell in his argument to per
mit the evidence if Therp t«rh« taken.
The court ruled in favofr of the de
fendant, but stated that the evidence
must only be considered If some con
nection is shown involving Senator
Jonesf Mr. Beeson in behalf of Sena
tor Jones also moved to strike from
the records all of Thorp's testimony,
but his tootloh, was overruled. Hr.
Thorp was1 not subjected to a cross ex
amlnation.

Paris, Nov. 20.—Germany is about to
follow up her declaration of Polish in

ment regarding Lithuania, according to
dispatches from Switzerland to the
morning newspapers/
The dispatches say the ijew state will
probably receive Prince Eltel FYiedrich,
second son of the emperor, as' Its sov
ereign, and will form a state of the
German empire with a similar status
to that of Bavaria or 'Saxony. As In
the case of Poland, the dispatches add,
a Lithuanian army will be formed to

could raise 150,000 men.

testimony to the Jury. Chief Wilcke
was at the scene of the Blue Island
ax murder half an hour after the 'dis
covery and before the bodies had been
removed. Circumstances surrounding
the Blue Island and Villisca murders
are almost parallel with the exception
of the number of victims. The defense
based its plea for the admission of
Wllcke's testimony on ratings of the
supreme court of Massachusetts hold
ing that where two' Crimea ire com
mitted under like circumstances and
with a similar tool It is permissible to
bring in the story of the one in an at
tempt to prove that the perpetrator of
both crimes was one and the same
person.
In the Blue Island murder, William
Mansfield's wife and daughter were
two of the, victims, and it I* claimed
Mansfield enacted the tragedy to rid
himself of his wife, whom he had de
eerted^-wife-desertion in Illinofe-'befng
a felony. In arguing for the admission
of this .story, counsel for wilkerson de
clared they would show at the time of
the^JBiue Island murder that Mansfield
was working in a sausake mahufacturr
ing plant in Milwaukee, Wis., where he
had not been away from his work until
July 4 and 5, 1915. The Blue Island
murder was discovered /the morning of
the 6th of July, that year. Judge Rock
afellow ruled that Chief Wilcke's tes
timony would he'admitted only on the
question .of mitigation of damages.:-?
Two Cases Parallel,
Chief Wilcke said that Detective
Wilkerson had gone over the scene ot
the Blue Island murder with him and
tha he had pointed out to the detec
tives the fact that the bodies of the
victims were all covered when first
found, that they had all been hacked
In the head with an ax, that all the
curtains In the house were pulled
down, that there were hacks !n the
ceiling over the beds of the murdered
people, that the murder was done on "a
Sunday night and that the murderer
,had left a lamp burning, a circum
stance which Dr. Cooper, of Villisca,
had told earlier in the day that he had
found when he went Into the Moore
home and saw the work of the ax-man.
Chief Wilcke declared the ax wTth
which the murderer had done his work
at Blue Island was left standing
against the, bed in which three of the
victims were found. This ax, with the
dried blood plainly visible on Its blade,
was shown to the Jury.
The Blue Island police chief further
testified that Mansfield's wife had car
ried life insurance payable to William
Mansfield, and that the beneficiary of
the pxlicy had never been back to
claim the premium.
.Got a Letter From "Mr. Jone»".
Before concluding his testimony
Chief Wilcke said that he had recently
received a letter from "a OMr. Jones at
yilllaca". Jflr. Wilcke was not permit
ted to tell of the contents af-that letter,
but Attorney Mitchell asked him to
send It to him and the witness replied
that he would do so. The chief said
Wilkerson's name wasvlh' the letter.
Harve fWillett, of Villisca, was the
last witness on the stand Saturday. He
said that he had met Mr. Jonee on the
Tuesday after the murder and that to
gether they had gone to a point be
tween the Presbyterian and Methodist
churches. Wlllett said that he and Mr.
Jones were talking about the way the
bloodhounds would go and that he had
suggested that they ought to take the
dogs to a man named Bartlett, that
they suspected that man.
"They suspect me, too," Wlllett said

A MESSAGE FROM INDIA.
Viceroy Tells Associated Press Country
Is Awaking to New Opportunities.
[From Associated Press Staff Corre
spondent, Copyright 1916 by Asso
ciated Press.]
Simla, India, Nov. 20.—India's new
ivceroy, Lord Chelmsford, today told a
correspondent of the Associated Press,
during a formal Interview, that the
war, by giving this country an oppor
tunity to show Its practical importance
to the epiptre, had stirred Indian as
pirations for development, politically
and economically, and declared that It
would be his endeavor to Becure a
practical response to this new desire
or progress. His excellency spoke
most warmly of the loyalty of India,
of the alacrity and fine spirit with
which princes and people had Identified
themselves with the cause of the em
pire, and of his own great Interest In
India's problems.
The viceroy spoke of the surprise
with which he had read various articles
In Amerf&tft papers purporting to de
pict conditions in India today and rep
resenting the country as laboring under
an oppressive rule and shaken by rev
olutionary and seditious activities.
Nothing to Conceal.
"The British government," contin
ued Lord Chelmsford, "has not deigned
formally to repudiate such calumnies—
perhaps this hats been a mistake—but
for my part the reply wlhch I give you
Is this 'Simple one:,
"Go wherevey you please thruout the
length and breadth of India. Study
our work and study our difficulties.
No sentry will bar-the way and no se
cret agents will shadow you. Talk to
whom you please see what you please
do what you. please, and then write
what you please. In India"*we have
nothing to cortceal. Will you tell your
countrymen that?"
The correispondent called attention to
the changing political conditions in
India and to the Met that certain In
uts
still more of the affairs of the govern
ment be-turned over to them.
No New Problem*.
"No doubt, fet the present moment,
political topics are attracting the
greatest attention both In and out of
India," replied, the viceroy, "but none
the leds lt ls ja mistake to siaipose that
these are new problems which have re
cently come up, or even dMferent prob
lems from those on which we ha^«e
Worked in The political devel

"British statesmen have already con
ceived in ff generous spirit their re
sponsibilities to India and the Indian?.
Perhaps the rate of political progress
has been slow, but constitutional de
velopment can hardly be other than
slow.
"The war, affording India an oppor
tunity of displaying Its practical Im
portance to the empire, has stirred In
dian aspirations and the new partner

the eympathy of the whole empire with
those aspirations."

FALL Of MONASTIR
OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
Opinion of Experts Divided As to
Whether Entente Forces Can Follow
Up This Success With Operations of
Sweeping Character—Serbians Given
Lion's Credit of Share in Taking of
Monastir.
The capture of Monastir by Gen
eral SamLil's army in Macedonia is
looked upon by entente military
writers as of notable military im
portance, but opinion is divided as
to whether it will be followed by
developments of sweeping char
acter.
tlvents of the next day or two
are expected to show wnether the
captors of the Macedonian capital
will require a period of rest before
starting a new advance, or whether
the pursuit of the retreating Ger
man-Bulgarl&n force is to be
pressed, despite adverse weather
conditions.
In some quarters an advance of
entente forces along the road to
Prilep is forecast, to be followed
by a thrust from Prilep toward
Negotln, on the Vardar, with the
object of outflanking the Bulgari
ans and opening up the frontier
passes northwest of Saloniki.
The situation in Greece appar
ently has reached another of Its
optical stages. Following the de
mands by the entente for turning
over virtually all arms and muni
tions of the Greek army* it Is re-'
ported today that the ministers of
the central powers have been or
dered by the entente authorities to
leave Greece by Wednesday.
The victory of General Sarrall's
armies on the western front end of
the Macedonian front, which result
ed in the capture of Monastir, is be
ing vigorously followed up. The
German-Bulgar forces, which evac
uated the city, are still- In ^ull re
treat, Paris reports today. Already
several towns north of Monastir
have' been taken by entente troops.
Press dispatches depict Monastir as
virtually deHtroyef "by fire and ex*
plosions and deserted,by the popu
lation and describes the retreat of
its defenders as a rout. Berlin, how
ever, declares the nfew positions
chosen north of Monastir were oc
cupied without entente pressure be
ing felt, and adds that fresh German
forces have arrived on the scene.
It asserts further that Serblun at
tempts to advance along the Mog
1
an lea front, east of Monastir, were
defeated.
The position of Roumania appears
increasingly precarious. General
von KalkenHayn's armies are con
tinuing their pressure and Petro
grad reports a further retreat of
the Roumanian in the Jiul region.
The greatest peril to the Rouma
nians lies in the reported cutting
of the railway from the Danube to
Cralva, threatening the flank of the
Roumanian army, south of Vulcan
pass, a!'.d making the position of
the Russian army at Orsova haz-
London, Nov. 20.—The retreat of tho
German-Bulgarian forces from Monas
tir toward Prilep is a debacle, says a
dispatch to the Wireless Press from
Rome today. The entente troops are
pursuing the foe and have occupied
villages north of Monastir, taking pris
oners as they advanced, the dispatch
adds.
Thq Serbians, according to tho ad
vices, are delaying entering Monastir
because of the fire and explosions
which have virtually destroyed the city,
from which the population has fled.
Serbs Given Full Credit.
The Serbians are given the lion's
share of honor by the morning papers
discussing the fall of Monastir. The
•apture of hill No. 12.12 by the Serbians
and their rapid advance to hill 1378,
threatening the Bulgarians' only av
enue of retreat alor^the Prilep road,
Is considered the main "factor in forc
ing the hasty evacuation of the olty.
Military opinion insists that the al
lies must now advance toward Prilep,
using Monastir as a base, and from
there to Negotln, on the Vardar. From
the latter town they claim the Bulga
rian positions east of Cerna could be
outflanked and the frontier passes
opened to the allied forces which are
now engaged northwest of Saloniki.
The fall of Monastir, Is considered
clearly to show the superiority of the
allies,over the German-Btilgar forces
in view of the formidable defenses
whfch had been created around the
city.
Sommo Thrust at Standstill.
Berlin, Nov. 20.—The military critic
of the Overseas Ne^d Agency writes:
"The great thrust on the Sommo has
come to a standstill. The small local
successes of the enemy could not be
developed and for the most part were
nfillllied by counter attacks. The fact
hat for several weeks tlje same vll
ages have been mentioned again and
again In official reports is the best
proof that the general battle on the
Somme has .come to a standstill."''

Gen. and Mrs. Leonard Wood, who
congratulated her. She was consid
erably chilled and. was -taken to the
hcuse of one of the officers to re
cuperate.
She had little to say about her
flight except that she had to fly lower
tlan she desired because of the haze.
It was cause for remark among those
who examined her maohine here that
llie^ttructure was such as to expose
her to the air more than in most ma
chines.
The machine used by Victor Carl
strom, previous holder of the Ameri
can non-stop record, established In a
flight Nov. 7, was of the Fuslllage type,
in the cockpit of which he was snugly
protected from the wind.
In the present flight Miss Law bet
tered the record by about 100 miles,
making the 590 miles in an air line
from Chicago to Horoell, N. Y., where
cbe arrived yefrterdiay without stop
pin nr.

Miss Law w»s given a« 9:87:36 hy
members of the hoard of governors of
the Aero Club of America. No attempt
was made by the club to compute her
actual flying time or average speed.
The latter was unofficially estimated
at about ninety-two mllis an hour for
the entire distance between New York
and Chicago.
