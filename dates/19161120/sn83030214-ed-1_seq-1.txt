WILSON PORTRAIT
BEGS FOR A HOWE
Dr. Frecdman, Out $450,
Would Use It to Start
a Hall of Fame
Dr. R. S. Freedman, who is out $450
because he tried to pet some one to
I accept a porlrait of Pre. ident Wilson,
| has a scheme that he thinks will rid
him of the expensive painting. Hc is
going to Washington next week to dis
COta with official? of thc Smithsonian
Institution a plan to start a Hall of
Fame in its building with tho picture
of Wilson.
The late Gustav (". Laagtnbcrg brgan
the portrait more than t4vo years ago.
lt was to bc a gift to the Kaiser from
the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce. It
I was almost completed on August 1,
1 1.14, bat about that time the Hamburg
! 'hamber of Commerce had other things
to 'hink about, and the picture reverted
to the painter.
He died on November _7, 1915, and
the portrait of Mr. Wilson was taken
ir. charge by some of thc artist's
? frienda. Dr. Freedman and a commit?
tee of the curators of the canva-, de
j cided that it would be appreciated if
i they made a gift of it to Mrs. Wilson.
I'residcnts' Wivea Neglected
"You see," said Dr. Freedman yester
' day, "the wive.s of 1'resiuents have al?
ways been negleeu-u. N'o one ever gave
: any one of them 60 much as a pencil
? or a shoe button, and we thought it
i would bo a nice little tribute to the
, First Ladv of vne Land to present tho
I portrait to her."
So a campaign was organized to ralao
i money to buy the picture for Mrs. Wil
. Fon. Mrs. J. Sherwin Crosby went to
; reo the "neglectcd" Mrs. Wilson last
May to cheer her up with news of the
I gift she might expect. Mr?. Crosby re?
ported that Mrs. Wilson, who was at a
garden party, gave her only eight min
, utes, mstead of the promised fifteen,
! but nevertheless agreed to accept the
! picture if thc prcsentation committee
I was not too large.
i /Although moro than ten thousand
' letters were sent out, the fund raising
', campaign was not suecessful. (Jifts
j amounting to abou; .f."0 were received,
! and Dr. Freedman ._.?uncd the expense
! of getting them at more than $1,000.
I Ambassador von bernstorff. he declared,
i sadly, never replieo. at all.
Then, after two months of work,
whirh included. Dr. Freedman .said. his
. wi. mental anc.iish in evolving an ap
propnate dedicatory lme ;o go with the
gift, Mr . WiUon ebanaed her mind.
She d.-ci.led thal ihe didn't want tht*

was kidnapped by politicians and tht
i picturo was still sccking a clairaant.
( ommitte* Too Large
According to Dr. Freedman. Mrs.
I Wilson changed her mind because the
i proposed pr.senUtion committee was
i too larre. Some of the members were

It is the first time in the history of
the brotherhoods and the federation ,
that the train service organizations
have countenanccd such a union of ;
force*. Although no definite statement

ill Washington that the object of the t
alliance is twofold to strengthen the

The forrnation of tne brotherhood

the only salient happening to-day in
the railroad-labor situation. Things
began to happen immediately after the

it appeared more nrobable than ever
that the brotherhood leaders would call

MEXICO ISSUE
NEARS A CRISIS
Wilson Orders Lane
to Stop Parleys and
Advise Action
IFrom Th* Trt_i*r.a Buraau j
Washington, Nov. 19.--As a result
of the decision reached last night at
the White House conference, Wash- .
ington officials prcdict that the crisis
of the Mexican situation will be
reached and passed this week. Within j
fc-rty-eight hours, perhaps, it will bo
kr own whether the Atlantic City con?
ference, after ten weeks of effort, is
_ success or a failure.
r'rora sources close to the President
it 4vas learned that if Carranza re- ,
ftiscs to meet the terms of the United
StatCI Mr. Wilson will pursue any
plaa that the Ameriean commissioners
su.eest. If the commission fails, it;
il believed, it will mean the end of ;
the Administration'a Mexican policy aa
it has existcd for three years.
Thi Ameriean commissioners, ac?
cording lo reliable information, will ;
recommend, ii such a ca_e, an iron
hard policy, with intervention as the
only alternative to recognition by
Carranaa of this government's moral
rrotectorato over Mexico.
Lane Goea to AtLantic City
Se-retary I.sne left to-night for \t
lautic City to try the plan that waa
agreed upon with the President and
Seeretaries Lansing and Baker last
nijrht. [tl details are secret, but Mr.
Lanc declared he was d-cidedly hope
ful of reaching a settlement with lt.
Before the White Hou.e conference
the pro>pects were admitted to be de?
cidedly gloony. A ot-adlock had been
reached at Atlantic City, due to Car
ranza's refusal t_ ratify any plan that
imposed a condition on Pershing's with?
drawal from Mexico. How this gap
was bridged is not anown, but it was
evident that Secrei__rv I_?ne after his
talk with the Presiaent Oelieved that it
had been.
The Dossibilities, as seen by studenta :
of the situation, are two. One is that j
the Ameriean commissioners will stand
pat on their originai proposal for a
conditional withdrawal, dependent on
Carranza's ability to clean up North?
ern Mexico. If this plan i_ adopted it
will be because ot a belief that Car*
ranza will capitulaie rather than force
? break in the commission that might
lead to intervention. 1 be President is
known io be set against intervention if
another solution can be found, but has
promised to abide Dy the conclusions !
of the commissioa
Poaaible Change in Form
The other possibility is that Presi?
dent Wilson will make a new proposal,
in which the conditional form of the
first plan shall be abandoned, but the
substance retained. Army offlcers say
that it would take six weeks for Per?
shing to withdraw from Mexico, unless
there was reason for greater haate.
An unconditiona! agreement to with?
draw could be made, therefore, and 1
vacatcd by this government if in thc
meantime Carranza failed to meet the
demands of the I'nit.d States.
Strong representations by the Brit?
ish and French governments have oper?
ated to convince the Administration
that its Mexican policy must be over- j
hauled. The Britiah government, par- ;
ticularly, is deeply concerned over the
possibility of a rebel attack on its oil [
siippl) at Tampico, in which case if ,
th>- I'nited States failed to intervene
Britiah intervention would be neces?
sary. The Tampico oil tields supply
the fuel for the British fleet.
I'nder the Monroe doctrine the
I'nited States could not countenance
Kuropean intervention in Mexico, and
the possibility of such action by Great
Britain. therefore, has caused conaid
erable dt.-<|uietude. At present there
are not revolutionary operations in the
neightiorhood of Tampico. but there is
no guaiante. that this state of quiet
will continu4-.

Government Nomadic for a Year
.Salonica. Nov. 19.?The temporary capital of .Serbia
will be immediately estahlished at Monastir. Considerable
forces of Serbians are with the Allied troops who have
occupied that town.
When the advance of Mackensen's army, in the sum?
mer of 191."), threatened Belgrade the capital was moved
to Niih. This city being menaced in October, 1915, the
Serbian government transferred the capital to Prisrend,
in Western Serhia, close to the Albanian border.
A month later, when their disastrous defeat at the
hands of the German commander swept them out of their
country, the Serbs estahlished their capital on the Island
of Corfu. Here. under Freneh auspices, the Serbian army
was reorganized.

ered as a counter measure to that of ,
Germany, accordir.g to the "Temps."
"A *imultaneous effort on the part,
of the Allie* mu?t be the answer to I
Cermany," the "Temps" ?ays. "Ger- j
many must be beaten; there is no j
other question. The duty of each tfl

The private automobile is a luxury

ment to *uppress, without delay, or
reduce the number of all automobiles
not strictly utilized in the public ser?
vice or de?tined for industrial or
commercial u?es. The report also rec
ommend* that the military authorities
use the railroads, if pogsibl*. instead
of automobile*, and that a careful

INVADE PLAIN
OF RUMANIA
Falkenhayn's Troops
Go Through Passes
in Wallachia
London, Nov. 19. -Falkenhayn's troops
have forced their way through the
mountain passes at two important
pointa in Northern Wallachia. In the
Jiul and the Alt valleys they are now
moving forward for the first time on
the Wallachian plain, at each point
?some twenty-five miles south of the
Rumanian frontier.
The invaders emerged from the foot
hills alonsr the Jiul River at Tenrujiul.
After a sharp battle with the Ruma?
nians the Germanic troops pressed for?
ward toward Copaciosa, deepening the
wedge that is slowly being driven tow?
ard the Craiova line.
In the Alt Valley the Teutons ad?
vanced in the face of the most *Jt_h
born resistance on both sides of the
river, and late yeaterday afternoon
forced the mountain pass and swept
into the towns of Caliman and Jiblea.
The railroad running southeastward
from the latter place to Pitesci and Bu?
charest was seized at its terminus, and
the victorious Teutor_ pushed still fur
ther south during the night.
New Rumanian P?*.il
Meanwhile, by striking down the
Matruh Valley from tne region north
of Orsova and the iron Gate of the
Danube, Teutonic forces smashed for?
ward to the Verciofova-Craiova rail?
road, in the rear of the Rumanians.
Linked with the Jiul Valley drive,
the movement starting from the Orsova
region aims at the capture of Craiova I
md the striking of a vital blow against!
the great southwest of Rumania. At'
the present moment the invading army
in the valley of the Jiul is separated
from the forces across the Danube
opposite Orsova by a scant thirty-five
miles. Every day sees the narrowing of
Um gap. With the enemy pressing
against their lines both on the north
and west, the Rumanians will soon find
themselves hedged in on three sides.
The junction of the two hostile
armies of invasion has already become
a probability. Its consummation will
compel the Rumanians to relinquish
their hold on the greater part of their
southwestern territory.
The new success of Falkenhayn's'
troops in the Alt Valley carries with it |
ii threat of no less danger to the de
ferders. From Caliman and Jiblea the
Teutons will be able to thrust two
strong arms deep into Rumanian terri?
tory. One will stretch southward along
the Alt, the other to the southeast
along the railroad to Pitesci and
Bucharest.
Capital Arteriea Threttened
Paralyzatlon of the heart of Ru?
mania and the arteries that flow from
the capital in every direction is threat?
ened by these two movements, the
initial success of which appears to be
inevitable.
The Rumanians are ill euipped at
the present moment to meet any sueb
great moves. They have suffered se- i
verely in killed and wounded and in
prironers during the violent fighting of
the last few weeks. Berlin announeed
to-day that Falkenhayn's troops have I
captured more than 19,500 Rumaniana
this month, or about 1,000 a day.
Lively infantry and artillery actions ;
are taking place in the Dobrudja region
near Silistria, on the eastern bank of
the Danube, and about forty miles
southwest of the Tchernavoda-Con
stanza railway.
ln the Tirgujiul Valley. between Jiul j
and Gilort, the Rumanians to-day
developed the advantages obtained yes?
terday. The Teutons were swept back
for some distance, and Ferdinand's
troops carried a series of important
heights.
In the region of Dragoslav.le the \
Rumanians also forced the battle with
success. smashing through the enemy's
lines for a slight advance and eapturing
many prisoners and a large amount of
munitions and guns.
Russian attempts to press forward
east of the Putna Valley broke down
t...f..re the determined resistance of
Bavarian regiments.

Serbs Win Back City
on Anniversary of
1912 Vietory
MANY PRISONERS
IN ENTENTE HANDS
Capture May Prove To Be
the Salvation of
Rumania
I Br Cflbla lo Tha Trtbur.* )
London, Nov. 19.?Monastir has
fallen. Outflanked by the Serbs,
who drove forward dauntlessly along
the ridges to the east, the Bulgars
and Germans evacuated the city, the
stronghold of Serbian Macedonia,
under cover of darkness. The Al?
lies entered at 8 o'clock this morn?
ing.
Thus the first fmita of their lon?
nnd bitter campaign have fallen to
King Peter's troops. They have re
gained one of their most important
cities, and as a symbol of the first
great step in reclaiming their land
have proclaimed it their capital.
The Bulgar-Teuton forces, swept
back by the brilliant assault, are re
treating in disorder to Prilep, says
a Reuter dispatch. The Serbian*
took a large number of prisoners
and stores. They are pushing after
the enemy, and already have consol
idated their positions on the Mon?
astir plain. In addition to Mona?
stir, the Serbians have captured the
villages of Grunishte, Brnik and
Yarashck and Hill 1378.
There is a vast amount of inspi?
ration in this Serbian feat. A year
ago King Peter's army was in wild
flight before the invading forces of
Mackensen, outnumbering them in
men and outranging; them in j?uns.
Anniversary of 1912 Vietory
Battered and rent by tho relent
less crunching of the German ma?
chine, they were driven from their
last foothold in their own land.
Then began the task of reorganiza?
tion. And now, on the annivtraary
of their conquest of the city from
the Turks in 1912, the Serbs once
more are in Monastir.
The advance of King Peter* troops
over the crests that buttress the Mon?
astir plsin will take its place In mili?
tary annaU. Ridge after ridge fell be?
fore the Serbian charge unt-.l the Bul
gar positions in the lowland had been
turned.
Then the big guns of the Allies wer*
moved forward up the plain as the
Teuton and Bulgar forces. caught by
the entilading tire of the Serbs on th*
east, were forced to f-U back. When
th* Entente artillery opened fire the
Teutonic armies had no alternative.
They evacuated the city.
Sarrail now has accompliflhed the
most important stroke of the entire
Macedonian campaign. It comes at an
opportune moment, for it is bound to
have an immense effect on the Ru?
manian situation. Though the Hul?
garians are strong enough to continue
their stiff resistance in Serbia, whera
the odds are greatly in favor of th*
defending forces, they can no longer
weaken their southern army to aid Fal?
kenhayn and Mackensen.
On the other hand, they may soon
find themselves in such a perilous posi?
tion that the German commanders may
be forced to draw from their own
forces to save their ally from di*a*ter.
An Important Feat
From a military atandpoint the re
capture of Monastir is extremely im?
portant. It has already compelled the
Bulgars to retire some distance to th*
north and east. In a few days they
probably will take up positions extend
ing from the Shar Mountain**, southeaat
of Prisrend, along the western edge
of the Vardar Valley.
The key to this line would be th*
Babuna Pass, north of Prilep. If th*
Serbs were able to sweep the enemy
from that part of the Vardar Valley
south of the eastern entrance of Ba?
buna. they would then have the ad?
vantage of the Salonira-Helgrade rail?
road and could smash forward to their
greatest victdries.
The Serbs' whole effort for the pres?
ent probably will aim at tne flanking
of the enemy out of the Vardar Vallay.
Frontal attaek would be not only cost
Iy, but probably unsucces?ful. During
the next few days, and possibly wa*k?.
the Serbs will drive on the Babuna
Pa*s, down thi Cerna Valley and
northwest toward Ochrida and along
the foothills of the Sh-ir range.
If these encircling movement* meet
with suceess there will be nothing to
stop the Serb* from winning the vital
part of the Oriental railroad and re?
claiming their whole countiy.
