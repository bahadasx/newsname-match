UNN TRIAL 111
BE BEARD NEXT
TERM Of COURT
Case Continued Until Supreme
Court Decides
on Race Appeal.
The case 01' the State against James
K. Linn, first on the criminal docket
and probably the most important case
scheduled for the present term of
court, was continued to the March
term of court this afternoon by Judge
Hnymond. This was done on tho suggestion
of Attorney \V. S. Meredith
for tho defense, who suggested to the
court that I he trial of the case ho
postponcil until after the supreme
court of appeals hail acted on the writ
of error and superccdcas granted a
few days ago by the supreme court
in the ease of the State against Race.
Judge Haymond, In making the postpotiement.
said that he wished to take
ail the responsibility for the action,
and intimated tha irrespective of
whether or not the supreme court of
appeals had acted on the Race case
by the March term, the Linn case
would he tried in the local circuit
court at that time.
The reason for the continuance is
that many of the proccedures involv
fid in tlx1 I.inn ease have not as yet
been Riven their exaet legal status in
the state, the liace-Limi eases being
the tlrst to lie brought under a particular
statue and that for this reason
action which the local court uiikht
take in the i.inn case might be questioned
by the supreme court, if the
local court's action in the Itacc case
was found to he not the correct interpretation
of the law.
With his moustache carefully waxed,
his clothes neatly pressed and brush-'
ed. a trifle nervous and very pale. John !
Tolatn. paramour of Mrs. Klizabelh j
Yaseo and accessory of hers in the!
murdering of Andy Yasco. her litis-'
band, appeared before Judge llaymond j
this morning and confessed to that !
charge.

day or two. when he will sentence ]

Ian was in court last Thursday when
Mrs. Yasco made her confession, but
at that time preserved a stolid silence.
Not till this morning did his reserve
completely give way and he asked to
be taken before the judge for confession.
Immediately after the Totan confession
the trial session of the court was
called to order. SO jurors, the largest
number ever drawn in the memory of .
local court officials, were present at
the opening.

$5,200,000 which tlio city of Montreal!
has expended on Its new acqueduct]
scheme to supply it with water and i
power from the St. Lawrence river
has been wasted according to a report
made public today by a committee of

The committee pronounced the

BALTIMORE, Nov. 20.?The nine-j
teenth annual report of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad is being distributed
today to its 27,000 shareholders,
covering the operations for the llscai
year ended June 30~aBd embracing
4,539 miles of main tracks and a total
of 9,042 miles of all tracks.
The total revenues were $111,668,680.34,
an increase of 21 per cent,
and exceeding by $10,113,548 the I
next largest earnings of 1913.
Operating expenses were $79,319,-1
S04.16. an increase of 24.08 per cent, i
Net revenue was $32,348,876.18, j
an increase of 15.99 per cent.
The year was one of unprecedented [
business activity. The crops were '
unusually auunuant and mining and :
manufacturing industries were ex-1
ceedingly active throughout the year. I
The export demand, especially heavy]
because of the continuation of the ]
great war abroad, taxed the terminal j
facilities at all of the Atlantic ports.'
and, with the absence of sufficient'
vessels to move the tonnage offering. ]
caused a congestion of traffic on the
eastern railroads, which was partieu- ]
larly severe during tin. winter I
months. The comnanv. however. I
handled a largely increased tonnage. I
and the freight earnings and the total i
revenues were the greatest in its his-,
tory.
The passenger traffic approached'
the maximum of former years, not- j
withstanding the entire suspension of I
immigrant travel, which formerly contributed
approximately one million
dollars per annum to the company's
revenue. There has been a steady incerasc
in through passenger traffic I
over the lines, which was augmented j
during the pasl year by the general j
business activity and the special trav-i
el in connection with the l'anatna-l'u-1
cilic Expositions at San Francisco and !
San Diego. j
Wit lithe increased revenue available
a liberal maintenance program
was followed. The total expenditures',
for maintenance exceeded those of
the previous year by something overi
twelve million dollars. While there
were increases in practically all the
maintenance accounts, the more important
increases contributed to the
improvement of track conditions and
the repair and rebuilding of locomotives
and freight cars, thereby increasing
the efficiency of the company's
plant as a transportation agency.
Neither the Baltimore and Ohio
nor any of its subsidiaries has any
notes or bills outstanding, and in addition
to the reserve under the re-'
runding and general mortgage there
is available in the treasury stocks and
bonds of Us own issue par value
$;i,682,t)00 and stocks and bonds of
nthor cnnin:inh?n which siro rnrrlprt tin
the books at J22.000.00u, but have a
market value of more than $15,000,000
in excess of that sum.
Liberal expenditures on account of
maintenance brought the property up
to a high stale of efficiency which was
largely contributed to by the improvements
and betterments made
during recent years. Indicative of
this, the average revenue freight
train load was brought to 700.67
tons, an increase of 9.R7 per cent.
The preceutuge or steel freight
cars, including cars with steel underframes
and Bteol certer-sllls, was raised
to 90.80 per cent of the total revenue
freight equipment, while at the
close f the preceding year this figure
was 8.38 per cent.

| 'Special Iu? West Virginian)
CHARLESTON. \V. Va.. Nov. 20.Serenity
is not expected to be characteristic
of the extraordinary session
of the West Virginia Legislature
which convened at the capital shortly
after noon today.
Front the standpoint of the onlooker
there will be plenty of luu. For
lite solous themselves there will probably
be uiore action than that incident
to former sessions of recent
j v.ii c. mu juat wnai win uuppvn itmains
for the future to disclose.
Just what the lobbyists of former
sessions have in tuind is nut known,
hut they began to arrive in Charleston
within a dozen hours alter Governor
Hatlield issued the call to bring
the law makers together.
Correctional, ruhtcr than constructive
legislation is on the card, and if
all were peaceful as between between
West Virginia Democracy and the Re-|
publican hosts, it would require no!
more than five days to carry out the
state executive's schedule, adjouru
and go home. As it is, there may be |
pitfalls and obstructions not antici-1
pated.
The governor has said that he lias
been and is opposed to any measure
that, would denrlvo hiu ultcciauni* of
the right to make all the appoint- j
Ments. It was within the province of j
the governor to include in the legislature
a cull a correction of the law
which gives the executive that power,
but he did not do so, and if John J.
Cornwell is finally proclaimed, after
official report of all canvasses of
votes have been taken, as governor of |
the commonwealth, he may map outj
his weeding program and be ready to
clean house, so far as is possible,
right away after .Vareh 4. If the extra
sessin doesn't change the statutes
now in existence giving the governor
the right to retire appointive office
holders at any time, that weeding j
process will be a mOBt interesting
one.
Interest in probable legisaltive acts
lias been overshadowed during the
greater part of tile last week by reason
of the promise of sensational disclosures
of election frauds practiced
at the general election in some of the
counties.
There is promise of many interesting
developments from proposed judicial
inquiries. These, it is said, arc
to be held in the counties of Marion,
Logan, Webster and Cabell. The Repulilicans
are asking for them, while
Senator W. E. Chilton is seeking further
membership in the United States
Senate to the unseating of Howard
Sutherland, his Republican and successful
opponent, who had something
like 5,000 more votes than were cast
for Senator Chilton.
It is said that possibly no etxra sessin
of the legislature would have been
called had not Senator Chilton ques- j
toined the election of Mr. Sut'tevland.
The cry of the Republicans ever since
tlte election has been that just us
sure as Democracy gets solidly in the
saddle that there will be hard sledding
ahead for all Republicans. The
legislature which must finish its work
before Dec. 1. when the terms of its
members expire?except those of fit
teen of the Senatrs?proposes to
make the sledding easier for some of
the holders of office.
No inattor what the legislature
does. Mr. Cornwell, as governor, will
have a great deal of patronage to
hand out, and judging from the
eagerness in evidence in every county
he will not haveany difficulty in finding
good old style Democrats to fill
every office at his dispocal, and then
have enough left over to form an i
army sufficient to protect the Mexican !
border.
There will be. of course, a great
many Republicans about the state I
huse during the next fohr years, even 1
after Mr. Cornwell is inauguratcdjif
that ceremony is not delayed by reason
of the judicial inquiries?and if'
the inquiries continue long enough it
may be a long time before any Democratic
appointments are made. It is
a sure bet that no holder of state office,
aside from Mr. Cornwell, will appoint
a Democrat. And all the Republicans
aside from Judge Ira E.
Robinson, who were on the ticket
have eviedntly beon elected, although
