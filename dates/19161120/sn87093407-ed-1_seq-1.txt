LIGHT REPORT RAPS PAPERS

Charging that "a subsidized

"the opposition has proportionately

FLIES FROM CHICAGO
TO GOTHAM IN SMALL
PLANE; STOPS TWICE
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.—Ruth Law, a
smiling American, took her place as the
premier woman aviator of the world today
when she set a new American record for
cross-country flying.
She landed at Governor's Island at 9:38
a. m., having flown 840 miles from Chicago
in an old style exhibition aeroplane.
Miss Law made but two stops, the first
at Hornell, N. Y., and the second at Bing
hamton, N. Y., where she spent the night.
She was forced to alight because she had run
out of gasoline.
Fully exposed to the wind and cold owing
to the fact that the type of machine she drove
forced her to sit out in front of her motor
without any shield, the plucky you g woman
outstripped Victor Carlstrom's rt »rd for
continuous cross-country flight made Novem

then continued her journey and flew further

FACE POWDER FOR
HER SHINY NOSE IS
MISS LAW'S REQUEST
NEW YORK. Nov. 20. —The
very first thing Mist Ruth Law
asked for today when she fin
ished the record-breaking aero
plane flight on Governor's
Island w»a face powder. Her
nose was shiny.
She was hustled Into a wait
ing automobile at the army
aviation field, whisked away to
the home Of Maj. Wm. Hart
mann of the army signal
corps, and the travel washed
off her rosy face.
Then this daring maid of the nir.
who had out-Carlstrommed Victor
Carlstroni in her flight from < hl
rugo to New York, placidly asked
of Mrs. Hurtnianu, "May 1 borrow
some of your face powder?"
Powders Her Nose
Having l owdered her nose, she
talked to the I'nlted Press of her
flight.
Sitting In an automobile and
rosy-cheeked from contact with the
frigid air of the upper regions,
swathed in sheepskin and oiled
garment*, she graphically describ
ed her thrilling voyage.
"I'm awfully well pleased that
I've heen able to bent the Ameri
can record," Miss Law began. Hut
I could have done better. I be
lieve 1 could have made the flight
all the way thru If things had turn
ed out the way 1 expected them to.
And I'm going to Irv It again.
Used an Old Plane
"When I made \i|> my mind to
Irv this flight," hlib Maid, "I got
Into communlOHtlon with the Cnr
llhh factory and tried to buy a l»tn
battleplane, one of the most pow
erful 1 could net. Hut tlic> would
not let me have ll They were
afrulil it woman could not bundle
Ibv powerful machinery and ma
low. barely toppmK the hills along
the Hudson In order U> be able to
see the ground and keep her bear
ings.
The fog was so dense. In fact,
that her flight was followed with
difficulty after she left Hlnghamton.
One report was received of her
passing Port Jarvis, but at many
points the aeroplane was invialble.
"I followed the Delaware & Sua
quehanna railroad for a time after
leaving Hinghamton," said Mis*
Law. "Then I cut across country.
Tt was pretty cold, but naturally It
was not as bad a* yesterday, when
1 was In the air much longer. I
finished the trip without taking on
any gaaoline In addition to that
with which the tanks were replen
ished at Hornell.
"I barely had enough to finish 0n...
As I neared Governor's Island the
engine was using the last. I vol
planed to the earth and landed with
the tank practically empty."
Miss l*w was given a rousing re
ception when she landed on Gover
nor's island. A band at the head of
a detachment of soldiers on morn
ing parade was playing as she was
alghted, and immediately the music
was turned Into a blare of greeting.
nipulate their big machine in that
long a trip.
"When they kept on putting me
off. 1 just decided to hop Into that
little machine and make one great
effort.
"I didn't think It hardly possi
ble that 1 could make the trip
without a stop. My machine will
not carry enough gasoline But
now I'm going to have that big ma
chine. and I'm going to try it all
over again."
Fog Furnished Thrill
Speaking of her machine. Miss
l«aw pointed laughingly across the
field to where her biplane rested
in the shadow of the huge aero
plane Carlstroni used when he at
tempted the flight between Chi
cago and Now York.
The sturdy, old-fashioned ma
chine with which Miss Law shat
tered Carltitrom'o record w-as not
half a« large as the Cllrtlss mon
ster that Carlstrom hml left on the
aviation field. The small machine
Is barely 100 horse-power, while
the other is capable of 200.
Speaking of her flight from Hing
hamton to Governor's Island. Miss
Lawr said it was about as risky an
undertaking as she had ever faced.
