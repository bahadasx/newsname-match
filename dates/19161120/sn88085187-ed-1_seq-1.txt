FOUR TACOMA STORES
STRIKE AGAIN, MR. MA YOR.
AT RISING COST OF LIVING
Major Fawcett:
Permit The Times to suggest that you go a
step further in this business of food costs.
You already have done a fine piece of work
in agitating the bread question. You have
placed the bakers on the defensive. Some of
them are rutting their prices and they all are
doing a lot of explaining.
You have started an immense number of
women to baking their own bread, which will
be a blessing both from the standpoint of econ
omy and of nutriment.
What The Times proposes now is that you
gather the best expert information there is
available on food economy TODAY in TACO
MA.
The most effective way to go about it, in
our opinion, would be to appoint a committee
of, say, seven, made up something like this: A
chairman, one authority on groceries and gro
cery prices, one well informed man on fish and
meats, one on fruits and vegetables, one do-

BREAD TRUST EMPLOYES
JOIN IN MAYOR'S FIGHT
Even the journeymen bakers
employed by alleged "trust bak
eries" in Tacoma are with Mayor
Fawcett in his crusade to break
the blgb bread prices.
A committee of bakers appear
ed before the mayor in his city
hall office Monday morning and
commended him for his fight
against their employers.
"We are all going to quit our
Jobs and start a co-operative bak
ery, as a result of the increase in
bread prices," said the leader of
the union men. But you came
in with your fight against the
trust and saved us the trouble,
mayor. You've got the bosses on
the run. They are losing busi
ness every day, simply because of
the number of women who are
baking their own bread."
The la-cent loaves of bread
were the cause of the Journey
men bakers' threat to start a
co-operative union bakery-
The trust bakers can turn out
15-cent loaves as easily as they
can 10-cent loaves, but it doesn't
take as many employes to do the
day's work. As a result, If 15
--cent loaves had become a perma
nent fixture, It would have meant
that one-third of the union em
ployes would have lost their jobs,
the committee told Mayor Faw
AND NOW IT'S UP TO CAPTAIN JERRY TO MARRY HIM A WIFE
"Perez," observed Captain Eri
cheerfully, "I'm tryin' to average
up with tbe mistakes of Provi
dence."
The Captain was seated by ths
open door of the dining room. He
was apparently very busy with a
piece of flshllne and a pair of long
legged rubber boots.
Captain Peres, swinging back
and forth in the rocker, was puff
ing deliberately at a wooden pips,

"You have the trust beaten
right now," the union employes
told Mayor Fawcett. "Keep up
the good work and they'll quit
soon enough trying to force lf>
cent loaves of bread on the pub
lic."
Fawcett repeated his an
nouncement Monday that the
bread trust had been broken.
"Hundreds of Tacoma women
are baking bread who have not
been doing it for years," said the
mayor.
"If tlie other women —those
who cannot bake bread —will re
frain absolutely from using trust
bread, and will patronize the bak
eries that are fair with the pub
lic, we will have bread prices
down to normal again in all
stores.
At present you can buy twice
as much bread ln one store as you
can In another, for the same
money. I'll tell the women
where to buy, too, if they will
ask me."

Airwoman Asks First
for Powder Puff Loan
(United Prruß 1.0i.nl Wire.)
MEW YORK, Xov. SO. —
The very first thing Miss
Ruth I.i.h asked for today
when she finished tlie record
breaking aeroplane flight on
Governor's island was face
powder.
Her nose was shiny.
Silt In.'. In an automobile and
rosy-cheeked from contact with
the frigid air of the upper re
gions, swatched in sheepskin and
oiled garments, she then graphi
cally described her thrilling voy
age.
"I'm awfully well pleased that
I've been able to beat the Ameri
can record," Miss Daw began.
"But I could have done better. I
believe I could have made the
way through If things had turned
out the way I expected them to.
And I'm going to try it again.
Wanted Battleplane
"I got into communication with
the Curtiss aeroplane factory and
tried to buy a big battle-plane,
one of the most powerful I could
get. But they wouldn't let me
have it
"They were afraid that a wom
an could not handle the powerful
machinery and manipulate their
big machine ln that long a trip.
"When they kept on putting me
off, I just decided to hop into
that little machine and wake one
great effort."
The sturdy old fashioned ma
chine with' which Miss Law shat-
tered Calrstrom's record was not
half as large as the Curtlse mon
ster that Carlstrom had left on
the aviation field.
Map on Her Sleeve
Speaking of her flight from
I tin rl, -i in ttm to Governor's Island,
Miss Law said it was about as
risky an undertaking as she had
ever faced.
"It was so foggy," she declared,
"It was almost Impossible for me
to see where I was going. There
were times when I skimmed over
the New York houses only 100
feet up. It certainly gave me
plenty of thrills."
On the cuff of one of the avi-
atrlce's gloves was a tiny map.
She had, drawn It herself and out
lined almost a perfect course from
Chicago. She had jotted down on
a slip of paper pasted alongside
the other one that whatever wet
there was dried up afore I got out
of the house. That's why I'm
splii in' 'em together this way. I
don't want to promise nothln' rash,
but I'm in hopes that even Jerry
can't loss 'em now. Where is

came from somewhere outside.
it the names of the towns over
which she passed, together with
other data for the records of the
Aero club.
Miss Law declared she had ab
solutely no trouble with her ma
chine. It behaved nicely all the
way for her.
Officials of the Aero Club of
America, which sanctioned the
flight, were enthusiastic over!
Miss Law's flight. She paid all
the expenses of the flight, but!
asked an official sanction for the
trip so it might be made a record.
Miss Law's feat was accom
plished on the anniversary of the
day she received her pilot's li
cense, Nov. 20, 1912.
This is the first distance flight
she ever attempted, but she has,
been making records for some
time.
She broke the altitude record
to* women on May 27 last when
she climbed 11,200 feet. Victor
Carlstrom, on this occasion, tried
for an altitude record in a baby
scout plane, but arose only 9000
feet.
Accompanied by Miss Pearl
McGrath and Richard R. Sinclair
of New York, she established a
record for height with two pas
sengers on Sept. 30, 1914.
Miss Law is 28 years old and
was born ln Lynn, Mass.
