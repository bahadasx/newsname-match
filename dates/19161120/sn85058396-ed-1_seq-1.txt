I Vigorous Pursuit of Germano-Bulgarians
I Is in Progress.
The victory of General oarrall's
t armies on the western end of the
Macedonian front which resulted yes
terday in the capture of Monastir, is
being vigorously followed up.
Tho Gcrmano-Bulgarian forces,
which evacuated the city as the result
j of tho successful flanking movement
' by the French and Serbians, arc still
in full retreat, Paris reports today.
; Already soveral towns north of Mon
r astir havo been taken by entente
,f troops. Press dispatches depict Mon
i astir as virtually destroyed by fire
and deserted by the population and
j: describe the retreat of its defenders
! as a rout.
Berlin, however, declares the new
positions chosen north of Monastir
if wero occupied without entente press
J ure being felt and adds that fresh
? German forces have arrived on the
i scene. It asserts further that Serb
j lan attompts to advance along the
j, Moglenica front east of the Monastir
'F region were defeated.
(I The position of Rumania appears
jT Increasingly precarious. General von
$ Falkenhayn's armies aro continuing
to force their way southward from
I the Transylvanian border and Petro
' grad admits a further retirement of
the-Humanlans in the JIul valley reg
i ion.
(l nccordlng to tho view of entente mil-
t itary critics, lies in the reported cut-
f ting of the railway from the Danube
(: to Craoiva, threatening the flank of
f. the Rumanian army south of Vulcan
i pass and making tho position of the
) Russian army at Orsova hazardous.
) The bad weather along the front
In France apparently has brought op-
! eratlons to a virtual standstill.

PLACE OF HONOR
FORSERBIANS
Fall of Monastir Considered
Great Victory and Given
Great Prominence in
Papers.
London, Nov. 20.-5:02 a. m. The
. Serbians are given the lion's share
of honor bv the morning papers in dis
cussing the fall of Monastir, The
, capture of Hill 1.212 by the Serbians
, and their rapid advance to Hill 1,378,
threatening the Bulgarians' only ave
' nue of retreat along the Prilep road,
is considered the main factor in fore
i lng the hasty evacuation of tho city.
Military opinion Insists that tho al
lies must now advance toward Prilep,
i .using Monastir. aB a.baaeandlrom
there to Negotin on the Vardar. From
the latter town they claim that the
Bulgarian positions east of the Cerna
could be outflanked and the frontier
passes opened to the allied forces
which are now engaged northwest of'
Saloniki.
The fall of Monastir is considered
as clearly showing the superiority of
the allies over the Qerman-Bulgarian
force In view of the formidable de
fenses which had been created around
the city.

Inquiry to Cover Wide Field
Every Phase of Transpor
tation Included.
NEED PRACTICAL ADVICE
Wise and Persistent Regula
.. tion That WilMVleet Every -Exigency
Needed.
Washington, Nov. 20. In opening
the first session of the joint congres
sional committee to investigate rail
road problems today, Senator Francis
G. Newlands of Nevada, the chairman, I
explained that the inquiry would cover
a w'ide field.
He said:
"It will relate to every phase of the ,
transportation question, the rail car-1
rters, the river carriers and the ocean
carriers and the perfection of a har
monious system of transportation em-
bracing rail and ocean carriers that j
will meet the demands of interstate j
as well as foreign commerce, and it j
will also be applied to telegraph and
telephone lines, express companies
and other public utilities.
"It will embrace not only the sub
ject of government control and regula
tion of these utilities, but also the ;
wisdom and feasibility of government
ownership and the comparative worth
and efficiency of government regula- j
tion and control as compared with
government ownership and operation."
Need Aid of Practical Men.
Senator Newlands said that a con
clusion would be more quickly arrived
at "if we hive the sympathetic aid
of practical men who for years havo
been conversant with the practical
side of tho transportation question, of
the economists and publicists, of rail
way executives and workers of com
mercial bodies, farmers and manufac
turers and shippers generally."
Referring to government ownership,
he said:
"It is a question that must be
faced. Other nations far advanced in
civilization have adopted the system.
Recently, under the stress of war,
nlmnst nil Riirnnpn n rnvornmnnlo
have taken over tho railways. It I
demonstrates that in conditiona of
great crises In which autocratic powers
must be given to the government, all
intelligent governments drift toward
absolute and complete operation of
the roads as the only solution of the !
question. !
"If we pursue the exercise and the
study of government regulation wise-(
ly, persistently and energetically, we
may create such a system of regula
tion as will meet every requirement,
both in time of peace and of war and
exigency or crisis. But It seems to bo
a wise thing for tho government to
ascertain now the history of the coun
tries that have adopted government
ownership and operation of railroads
and to watch the experiences of tho
European countries In this regard.
"In this connection will come the
question of taking over the railroads.
Shall it be accomplished by an actual
valuation of the railways and a con
demnation of them, or shall they be
taken over by the easier method of
taking ov5r tho stocks and the bonds
at their market value, thus, at one
stop having the national government
take the position of stockholder and
security holder in these great corpor
ations?" Strikes Are Brutal Processes.
Strikes as a mean8 of settling labor
disputes, Senator Newlands character
ized as "tho most barbaric and brutal
of processes." '
Hours and wages of employes must
be considered carefully, Senator New
lands declared, because "tho burdens
which constitute tho operating ex
penses of these corporations are in
time transferred to tho shippers."
Senator Newlands outlined the pro
JjlOfiPln ,to, reorganize, tho Interstate
' i
Mccormick, walsh and garfield may
get places in president's cabinet
Commerce Commission and to create
federal agencies which might supplant
state authorities in exercising control
over railroad financing. He said:
"The question will be consid
ered as to whether the commission is
now overloaded and if so whether this
difficulty should bo met by relieving
It of many of the supervising and ad
ministrative duties which it now exer
cises, or by enlarging and sub-dividing
it so as to enable it to meet the
strain of its various duties.
"Another important question
will be the question of control of rail
way and other public utilities' se
curities. As it is in most states, pub
lic commissioners are regulating the
l issue of securities upon the railroads
I within the boundaries of the state
over which each has jurisdiction.
Should Create Tribunal.
"It is suggested that tho United
States government by reason of its
power over interstate commerce
i should create a tribunal for that pur
pose or give such control to the Inter
state Commerce Commission.
"There will also come up the ques
tion as to whether the nation or the
states should create the great organ
izations that serve the purpose of in
terstate commerce."
Railroad Taxation.
Commenting on suggestions that
railroad taxation ho put in the hands
of federal authorities, exclusively,
Senator Newlands said:
"Wo find tho greatest diversity In
tho taxing of various states, somei
states Imposing burdens upon tneso
corporations and others Imposing very
light burdens; somo taxing only the
visible property, others taxing the in
tangible thing termed a franchise;
somo of them adopting the market
price of the stocks and bonds as the
standard measure of valuation, others
contenting themselves simply with the
physical valuation of the actual prop
erty within tho boundaries of the
state."

GERMANY TO FORM
ANOTHER STATE
Paris. Nov. 20, 5:05 a. m. Germany
is about to follow up her declaration
of Polish independence with a similar
announcement regarding Lithuania,
j according to dispatches from Switzer-Land-to-the
mornlng-newflRanerflr,rfl&:
Top, Vance McCormick (left) and
Thomas J. Walsh. Bottom, Harry
Garfield.
Although it has been officially
denied that President Wilson con
templates making any changes in his
cabinet, rumors as to possible
changes continue. It is said that Mr.
Wilson looks with extreme favor on
Vance McCormick, manager of his
successful campaign. Senator Thomas
J. Walsh, of Minnesota, who was in
charge of the western headquarters
and deserves much credit for the
winning of the west; and Harry Gar
field, son of the late President par
field and now president of Williams
college, a Republican who supported
Wilson during the campaign.
dispatches say that the new state will
probably receive Princo Eitel Frleder
Ich, second son of the emperor, as its
sovereign, and will form a state of
the German empire with a similar
status to that of Bavaria or Saxonia.
As in the case of Poland, the dispatch
es add, a Lithuanian army will be
formed to fight under Field Marshal
von Hindenburg. It is estimated that
Lithuania could raise 150,000 men.

OGDEN HAS FIVE 01
THE ALL-STATE
IBM
All-State Footfall Team.
Ends Spencer, West - Side; V.
Conroy, Ogden.
Tackles Andrews, West Side;
Hurd, East Sido.
Guards Worley, East Side; Rich,
Ogden.
Halfbacks Romney, East Side;
Dee, Ogden.
Center Bagley, Ogden.
Fullback Falck, Ogden.
Quarterback Steiirei, west bide
(captain).
By the vote of the athletic coaches
of the Utah high schools, five Ogden
football players havo been " assigned
positions on the all-state high school
team. That the judgment of tho
coaches was good is not questioned,
as these five youths, Falck, Dee, V.
Conroy, Bagley and Rich, were big
factors in bringing the state cham
pionship to Ogden.
"Luke" Falck, all-state fullback,
was the best all-around player seen
in a high school uniform this year.
Though his regular position was left
half-back, he was as often shifted to
fullback to start and complete plays.
As a ground gainer, he was in a class
with Deo, Steiffel and Glasmann and
he excelled the latter two players by
playing through all five of the games
in which the Tigers participated.
Aside from his superb playing on the
offensive, Falck was strong on the
defense, being the equal of any back
fiel dman in the state as a tackier.
Dee, who is known among his fel
lows as "Peanuts," was considered by
coaches and fans alike as the greatest
high school halfback ever developed
in the state, despite his being the
smallest regular in the game this year.
as a runner and tackier, he had few
superiors and his almost uncanny
manner of discovering holes in the
enemy's line, was equalled by his
ability to gain a few more yards, af
ter being caught with the ball, by
his eel-like system of keeping in mo
! f,nn uic rnnfi rniturfi in all circum
stances also made him a big favorite.
Rich Is a clean-cut and powerful
young athlete, whose ability to make
holes for the backfleld men to carry
the ball and show strength on defense
was featured in every game.
Bagley won the center position fair
ly, his passing always being accurate
and interference strong.
V. Conroy, the other Ogden star,
is faBt and clear-headed. His work
at offense and defense throughout the
season was notably above that of the
other high school ends, with the
probable exception of Spencer, the all
around West -Side athlete.
Steiffl won the ppsltion of captain
by unanimous vote, and was alHO con
sid,ercd one of the greatest quarter
backs ever developed in a Utah high
school. He displayed good general
ship at all times, was a good ground
gainer and a powerful tackier, Wor
ley. the other guard, was a good
match for Rich of Ogden. Adams and
Hurd, all-state tacklers, could almost
always be counted on to open holes
in the opposing line, whether tho play
was for or against them. The smash-
Ing lino bucks of Romny. won that
player the right half-back position.
. Ho was also good at end runs and
j strong on defense

GREAT THRUST ; I
AT STANDSTILL I
General Battle on the Somme ,
Split Into Isolated Attacks,
Writes German Critic.
COVETED HEIGHTS HELD H
Germans Maintain Positions
After Desperate Battle ! '
Fresh Enemy Corps
Arrive. '
Berlin, Nov. 20. By Wireless to
Sayville. Tho military critic of the
Overseas News Agency writes:
"The great thrust on the Somme j
has come to a standstill. Last week
the general battle was split Into iso-
lated attacks. The small local sue- I
cesses of the enemy could not be do
veloped and for the most part were
'nullified by counter attacks. Tho fact
that for several weeks the same vil
lages have been mentioned again and
'again in the official German reports
and those of the entente is the best
proof that the general battle on the
Somme has come to a standstill and
that the British as well as the French I
are limited to Improving their posi- j
"Although the British won small lo-
cal successes near Grandcourt and
the Germans were again driven from j
Serre, tho coveted heights of Serre j
remained in German hands after a Ij
desperate battle.
"Three fresh army corps were !
brought up by the British for the I
great attack of November 13-14, the j.
objective of which was not merely
Beaumont-Hamel and Beaucourt, but j
Bapaume, as is proved by orders that
were found. After the failure of the !i
mass thrusts isolated attacks were :
continued by the British all through I
the week. These were without sue-
cess and on Saturday the British j
again made a general attack on both s
sides of the Ancre. This new at- j
tempt to break through our line was ' VM
a failure. On the twelve kilometer j WM
front the enemy was repulsed almost
everywhere and his insignificant sue
cesses at some places required the ' jH
heaviest sacrifices. Local success at '!
the bend of the Ancre was paid for j
by the British with losses elsewhere
on the front Tho Butte de Warlen-
1 court, a hill which bars the road to i
Bapaume, which was captured by the 1
British on November 14, at tho ex- lfl
pense of enormous sacrifices, was re- jJ
captured by the Germans on the 16th. j
A surprise attack was made by the I
Germans without artillery preparation l
' and the opposing troops fled. Only
two non-commissioned officers and
seventeen men could bo captured. The
prisoners bore no arms. They were
Australians who were most weary of mM
war and they declared that all tho fH
Australian troops on the Somme front IH
were kept up only by .the hope of
speedy relief.
"Isolated attacks by the French
were equally unsuccessful. Near St.
Pierre Vaast wood a French attack
broke down with heavy losses and J
near Pressoire little was gained."
