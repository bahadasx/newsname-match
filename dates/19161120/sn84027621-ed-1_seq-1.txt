- of war materials.
serbs will Again have a
capital city 7
After having been for months men
without a country, the Serbians are
again to establish their capital on na
tive soil. Monastir, in southern Ser
bia, for which the entente forces have
been struggling since the advance
from their base at Saloniki began, has
been evacuated by the German and
French forces and occupied by the
French and a considerable number of
Serbs. The French and Serbians hav
ing captured the crest of hills partly
surrounding the valley town, the Ger
mans found their position untenable
and withdrew. Unofficial advices from
Saloniki say that a temporary cap
ital of Serbia will be immediately es
tablished at Monastir. With the re
occupation, of Monastir the railway
line from the entente allied base at
Saloniki now is in entente hand?.

OF POLITICAL IMPORTANCE
The capture of Monastir is looked
upon by entente military writers as of
notable political importance. Opinion
appeared divided however, as to
whether it would be followed by
sweeping military developments. In
some quarters it was predicted k the
entente allies would advance toward
Prilep and from there toward Nego
tin with the object of outflanking the
Bulgarians and opening 'passes north
west of Saloniki. '

Highway. During the last few days
there have been cars from Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Michigan,

ALCOGAS"
Florida Man Has Invented a New and
f Powerful Auto Fuel
(Fort Lauderdale Herald)
The experiment made in Miami last
Tuesday with Alcogas proved a won
derful success.
Charles Abbey who is the inventor
made the demonstration at the Buick
Garage, using a new Buick six-cylinder
car. The car was cold but was
immediately and easily started,
Mr. Abbey claims that Alcogas is
more powerful than gasoline and will
run a car as far per gallon. It is made
out of the. green corn stalks which at
the tasseling time is high in sugar. He
claims it can be made for 5 cents per
gallon. In his opinion 109 gallons can
be made from one ton of corn stalks
and the 'Glades can grow 40 tons to
the acre at one planting.
There is no carbon in the Alcogas
and besides it will not freeze as easily
as gasoline, therefore it would be
practical in the north.
Mr. Abbey makes his experiments in
Davie, where he has a laboratory.
The people of Broward .county are
much interested in his work and we
hope he soon will make some arrange
ments to manufacture the gas at Da
vie. -.,
We understand he has several par
ties in trested and no doubt something
will develop in the near future.
At all stages the Alcogas is poison
ous and cannot be used for any pur
pose but burning, therefore it avoids
all government revenue according to
Mr. Abbey's statement.
We await developments with much
interest.

SPINNING MILL WILL HAVE UP-TO-DATE AND COMMODIOUS
STRUCTURE AT CORNER OF SOUTH FOURTH
AND MAIN STREETS
Ground was broken this forenoon
for Ocala's new hundred thousand dol
lar spinning mill.
For several months George Giles &
company have been negotiating with
eastern capitalists for capital with
which to open a spinning mill in this
city. Saturday the deal was closed
and what has been a prospect is now
a reality. ' ...
Contract has been let for the con
struction of a two-story brick build
ing 75x175 feet at the . corner of
South Fourth and Main streets, which
will be occupied by the new-spinning
mill.
Mr. Booth, who for several years
past has been superintendent of the
Ocala Knitting Mills, returned Satur
day with the final details for the new
concern,; and will have charge of the
interior construction work and plac
ing the machinery. - - .
Work on the excavations for foun
dations began early this morning, and
already wagons are seen hauling rock
for the work. All the building' ma
terials have been "contracted for and
will be put in place as rapidly as pos
sible as the new company is desirous
of starting the machinery at the very
earliest date possible. v
The new building will be just south
of the Ocala Knitting Mills property
and will face Main street, '
While the same interests that
operate the knitting mill be be back
of the spinning mill they are two esp
arate corporations. The new mill will
employ upward of 250 people, which
means that Ocala's weekly payroll will
be considerably advanced.'"- - '
While the principal material used
for the spinning mill will be short
staple cotton, it is the intention of the
company to use a large quantity of
long cotton' for its high grade threads.
This means that a great portion of the
long cotton that is now being grown
in Marion and adjoining counties will
be manufactured into cloth right here.

BETTER THAU
EVER BEFORE
PROSPECTS ARE BRILLIANT
THIS YEAR FOR THE BIG
INDUSTRIAL PARADE
That the industrial parade will this
year prove to be an even greater
feature of fair week than it did last
year is becoming very evident. A
petition signed by 25 citizens of Lake
county has been received, asking that
the date of the parade, be changed
from Wednesday to Thursday, in
order that the people of Leesburg and
Lake county in general might have
a better opportunity of witnessing
the procession, Thursday being
Thanksgiving day and a holiday.
Unfortunately, it will not be. pos
sible to make a change in the day of
the parade at this late date, as much
as the parade committee would like to
accommodate the good people of
Lake. Wednesday was named as the
day for the parade, because it was
found that a parade held on Thanks
giving morning would interfere with
the services in the various churches
in the city. ' The committee is hoping
that the people of Lake will attend
the fair on Thursday in spite of the
parade being held on the day before.
Thursday is always a" big' daywand
this year the fair promises to exceed
itself in many respects.
The petition from Lake county was
forwarded to Ocala by" Mr. Max - M.
Fishel of Leesburg, an Ocala boy who
does not forget his home town.

I1UCIIIG THE GDVEH1T TO CUT A CAIIAL
FROM SILVEO MIS TO OCALA
Jacksonville, Nov. 17, 1916.
Secretary Board of Trade, Ocala, Fla.
Dear Sir: Referring to my letter
of Sept. 1st on the above subject, this
is to notify you that I am now pre
pared to send a representative of this
office to Ocala for the purpose of mak
ing the preliminary examination, Sil
ver Springs to Ocala, and would like
to have you inform me if the board of
trade is now prepared to present such
data and arguments as it, contem
plates presenting in relation thereto.
I am today writing to Congressman
Frank Clark asking what date is most
suitable, in his opinion for the exami
nation, inasmuch as I believe he de
sires to be present at that time. I will
endeavor to have the examination
made on a date that will be agreeable
to all parties concerned.
Very respectfully,
W. B. Ladue,
Lieut. Col., Corps of Engineers.
: Editor Star: The enclosed letter
from Major Ladue, together with the
information conveyed to the Board of
Trade by Col. Rogers from Congress
man Frank Clark' recentlyr gives us
room to believe that there is a prob
ability of us getting the canal from
Silver Springs to Ocala if the people
of Ocala want the canal and will get
together and make concerted effort to
that end. This matter is coming up
for discussion at the meeting of the
Board of Trade Friday evening, the
24th, and every one interested in the
matter should be at that meeting to
discuss the matter. I hope they will
be there. L. R. Trammell.
Secretary Board of Trade.
SOLDIER BOYS WANT
AN AUNT SAM
Their Uncle Isn't Always as Good as
They Want Him to Be
(Special Correspondence of the Star)
Laredo, Nov. 14 The election is
over so is pay day the latter being
the most important, to a soldier. With
what a soldier makes he can afford
one "big night" every other pay day,
and this was the "every other."
Company A is guarding the inter
national foot bridge and the railroad
bridge. Captain Drake, in command
of the first platoon is looking after
the foot bridge. Lieuts. Campbell
and Marsh are in command -of the sec
ond platoon at the v railroad bridge.
The only thing here that looks scary
is a big graveyard over in Nuevo
Laredo. It's all white (painted white)
and from its size .there seems to be
more dead Mexicans than there are
live ones. Mexican soldiers-are as
scarce as white elephants.
On warm days one would think the
Rio Grande was some popular bath
ing resort, as many Mexicans are
bathing here all hours of the day. If
they used bathing suits they would
dry the river so all of them bathe
minus. A cold wave hit Laredo yes
terday and the thermometer register
ed 38 degrees.
The boys on guard here at the rail
road bridge have a palace to sleep in,
a 10x12 room, with a coal heater in it.
There are only ten here. Mr. "Cracker
Boy" Thomas is on the bridge now, his
teeth playing "Home Sweet. Home."
If Uncle Sam doesn't hurry up and
fix us up for winter, the boys are go
ing to petition Aunt Sam to use her
influence on him. Maybe he will sit
up and take notice, since so many of
her nieces are voting. The women are
a soldier's best friends.
A soldier's life is one of expectation
and disappointments, mostly disap
pointments. We are expecting to be
back in Florida before Christmas, but
it looks as if we will have to add one
more disappointment to our list. If
Thanksgiving wasn't so near we would
expect to be thankful the last Thurs
day in this month. Tho we will mls3
turkey and cranberries, we will be
glad on that day.

CRITICISMS ON THi
PAI1AFJA CAIIAL
GIVEN A CAUSTIC BUT EFFEC
TUAL ANSWER BY MAJ.
GEN. GOETHALS
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 19. Sharp lan
guage is .employed by Major General
George W. Goethal3, governor of the
Panama Canal Zone, in replying to
published criticisms of the big water
way which he charges have seriously
affected its commercial rating. In his
annual report, made public by the war
department, the governor declares
that the earth movements which have
frequently interrupted traffic through
the canal finally will be overcome for
all time.
General Goethals goes ' into a
lengthy review of the geological prob
lems which have been encountered, of
the steps taken to overcome such ob
stacles and the measure fo success at
tained. So far as the Culebra cut is
concerned, he said, "the worst is over,
the intervals between movements are
becoming greater and the quantities
of material less." r
; The report replies to the published
statements of Professor Benjamin Le
Roy Miller of Lehigh University, and
former Senator Thomas Kearns of
Utah. The charges made in each case,
General Goethals brands as "erron
eous, unwarranted and unfair." It Is
shown in the report that during a part
of the fiscal year 1916 during which
the canal was opened, 411 vessels
passed from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific and 376 in the other direction. Of
all these, only 91 were engaged in the
American coast-wise trade.
The total cargo tonnage handled
was 3,140,046 as against 4,969,792 the
preceding year, although the water
way was in operation for- only five
months last year. Commenting upon
the. reduction in coastwise traffic
shown, however, the report says it
was due principally to the scarcity of
ships for foreign trade which drew
American coasting vessels into that
service.
Difficulties of the present system of
levying tolls are recited and General
Goethals again recommends that legis
lation be sought making the earning
capacity of a ship the basis upon
which charges should be computed.
He points out that $2,399,830 were col
lected in tolls during 1916. Had the
so-called Panama Canal Rules applied
in measuring the ships, he adds, the
sum would have been increased by ap
proximately $400,000.

hand when the marshal offered the
boat for sale. The first and only mid
made was the one of the Standard
Oil company, $275. Mr. Vinzant ex
hibited a certified check for that
amount and said he was authorized
by the Standard people to pay that
amount for the libeled boat, and hear
ing no other bid it was knocked down
