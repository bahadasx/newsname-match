By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Nov. 20. Tlo udminis.
tintion will. aland for but littlo further
delay from the Mexican side of the At
lantic City conference. Its patience is
at the breaking point and the next fuur
days may bi iug important . development-
The Mexicans will be told emphatical
ly inlangu.ige stripped of all diplomacy
that the Uirfted States cannot sit in the
sessions if dilatory, obstructive tactics
are continued.
By such means the administration
hopes to force a peaceful agreement on
vexatious problems between the two
nations. The border palrol plan is but
part of what this government hopes to
accomplish. I'rimnrily, however, protec
tion and safety of American rights and
property in Mexico is the big problem.
If these results are not obtained satis
factorily aud a border patrol plan f
focted, now steps will be taken.'.
What the alternative course is in
event of failure at Atlantic Cltv no one
would say. President Wilson, Secretar
ies Lane, Lansing nnd Buker alone
know what it is. But it is freely pre
dicted by those close to Mexican' prob
lems that a shift in policy will be forth
coming which will deal rnther more
strictly with Mexico than in the past.
The administration, however, is really
hopeful that such ideas need not be
used; lenders think that the Mexican
commissioners will be whipped in line.
The significant part of the emphatic
talk stated for this week is that Presi
dent Wilson approves it .nnd is backing
his commissioners in their whole plan, of
forcing settlement.
The commission was to convene again
t Atlantic City today after a week-end
adjournment.

Would Do Away With
Electoral College
Portland, .Or., Nov. SO. Carrying a
proposed amendment to United "States
constitution nbolishing the electoral
conege, renntor ucorgo C-hnmhberlain
of Oregon is en routo to "Washington
today. Jlo believes the electoral college
is obsolete and that the president
should be chosen by direct, popular
vote.
In explaining that tho electoral col
lego system might frustrate the will
or tlie majority, Chamberlain pointed
out just before starting cast that in the
present election 0,000 votes in Califor
nia ' might have swung that state to
Hughes and elected him, whereas Wil
son had a popular lead of 4UO,000 votes
throughout the country.
Chamberlain said his amendment
would be proposed so it could become
offectivc before tho 1020 election.

IS WARDEN OF
Selected hy Board This Morn
ing for the PlaceIs
Well Known Here
Charles' A. Murphy, formerly cap
lain of Company M, Third regiment,
Oregon nnliounl guard, was chosen to
be warden of the Oregon slate peniten
tiary this morning at a twenty minute
session of the board of control.
Captain Murphy i now chief engin
eer at tho eastern Oregon branch of
the Oregon stato hospital at Pendleton.
lie was one of th numerous candidates
who filed application with the board
of control. lie will take charge of the
penitentiary immediately upon accept
ance of the appointment und arrival in
Salem.
It is generally -conceded that the
board could not have chosen a more
acceptable man to fill the extremely
difficult position of warden. In
Charles Murphv was second lieutenant
of .Company K in tho famous Second
Oregon United States volunteers. This
was the Salem company, lie tougnt
through the Spanish-. .ineritnn war and
the l'hilippino insurrection and gained
distinction as a competent officer.
In ISOSt he was commissioned to or
ganic a provisional battery from the
members of the regiment. This he com
manded alid received high commendn-
tiou from Major lleiiernl r;. b. Otis lor
the services he rendered.
After tho war was over and the Sec
ond Oroson returned he was elected
captain of Com puny M, which position
he held until about 190t, when he re
signed. A short time later he was ap
pointed superintendent of construction
at. the new brunch hospital at Pendle
ton and practically built it. He was then
mndo chief engineer.
Captain Murphy, while commanding
officer of Company M, was regarded as
the most efficicut Wficcr .in the Third
regiment and was held in high .esteem
by the men umler mm. witu ms ex
perience in army discipline and in lead
ing men. he is believed to be the right
man to bring order out of chaos now
existing iu the penitentiary.
That tlie job or warucn is a gulu
brick is generally conceded and nt most
a thankless tnsk. However, iir view of
the events of last Friday, when the
convicts demunded ft change of admin
istration in what was a near-riot in
the prison chapel, they were not con
sulted as to who should be warden over
them. It had been unofficially suggest
ed that perhaps a solution of the prob
lem would be to havo tho convicts
choose one of their number to bo war
den. The vote of the board of control at.
the meeting this morning wns as fol
lows: Governor Withyeotnbe "d Treas
urer Kuv for Murphy and Secretary Ol
cott for Frank Meredith, former aec
retsrv of the Oreeon state fair.
In" voting for Meredith, Secretary
uliott said he believed te was a xnor
ough business man nnd a capable lead
er of men. Meredith who was not a con
didate and had filed no application.
Sheriff F.sch, whoso name was men
tioned as a possible candidate, had
made no application for the position.
A delegation from Portland presented
the cause of Deupty Sheriff Fitzgerald
of Multnomah Bounty to the board.

It is well known that of the six lead

that tho Chemawa school was in a bad

Starr Jordon.S chancellor emeritus of
Stanford university, and peace disciple,
isn 't a bit pleased over the fact that
Professor -Melville B. Anderson, former
head of Stanford's English department,
has dedicated to Dr. Jordan "The Great
Refusal." This war poem is a bitter at
tack upon pacifism and hurls sarcasm at
peace lovers.
"It's good poetry but miserable
logic," said Jordan. "I can understand,
sympathize, admire, but I remain un
convinced. To us who abhor the all-
deutschtun verb and, war is not a
heroic deed, nor succession of deeds, but
the culmination of crime."

Bryan Begins Four Year fight
in Chicago for a Sober
Country -s
Chicago, Nov. 20. On the heels of
henvl political campaigning, William
Jennings Bryan was to plunge into his
four year prohibition fight today with
on address before the Chicago Dry Federation-
Bryan's speech here is the sig
nal for the opening of a campaign to
make Chicago dry in 1918, It is also his
opening shot in a four year campaign
to make the United States dry. Before
he is through the commoner plans to
force nn nuti-booze plank into the plat
tonus or both big parties. He said the
present prohibition wave would sweep
every state in the unon.
"I believe that prohibition will be
the paramount issue of 1020. Unless the
amendment is made before that, it i.1
probable that tho amendment will be
spbmittcd iu 1920. It is even possible
that it may puss this winter. The demo
cratic purty is iu a position now to take
up the subject and the republicans may
be compelled to."
Iu commenting on the re-elect ion of
President Wilson, Bryan said:
' "I am very much gratified nt tho re
sult. As the value of the victory is
iiicrc.iKcd. it has put an end to the k.
perstititon that no victory could be won
without New Yorlf. The belief that the
Now York vote was necessary lias bad a
restrain. 'ig influence for a generation
up to this -idininistratioii. The country
will now eil free to legislate ftfl it
pleases and .Vew York will be treated as

AEROPLANE TRIP
Made the Trip In Eight Hours
and 59 Minutes, or 94
Miles An Hour
PRIMITIVE MACHINE
BEHAVED SPLENDIDLY
Strong Head Wind and Dense
Fog Made Trip Thrilling
One
New York, Nov. 20. The very first
thing Miss Kuth Law asked for today
when she finished tho record breaking
aeroplane flight on Governor's Island
was face powdor. Her noso wns shiny.
She was hustled into a waiting auto
mobile at tho army aviation field,
whisked away to the home o" Major
Villiam Hartinann, of the army signal
corps, nnd the travel washed off her
rosy-face- Then this daring maid of the
air, who had out-Cnrlstromcd Victor
Carlstrom In her flight irom Chicngo
to New York, placidly asked of Mrs.
Hurtmnnn: "Mny I borrow Borne of
your faco powder t"
Having powdered her nose, she talked
to the United Press of her flight.
Sitting in an automobile and rosy
cheeked from contact with tho frigid nir
of the upper regions, swathed in sheep
skin and oilod garments, she graphical
ly described her thrilling voyage.
"I'm awfully well pleased that I've
been able to beat tho American record,"
Miss I,aw began. "But I could have
done hotter. I believe I could have
made the flight all the way through
if things had turned out the way I ex
pected them to.' And I'm going to try
it again.
"When I made up my mind to try this
flicht from Chicago to New York," she
said, "I got Into communication with
tho Curttiss aeroplane factory and tried
to buy a big bnttlo plane, one of the
most powerful I could get. But they
wouldn't let me have it. - They wero
afraid that a woman could not handle
the powerful machinery nnd manipulate
their big machine in that long a trip.
Tackled Old Machine.
"When they kopt on putting me off,
I just decided to hop into that little ma
chine and make one great effort.
"I didn't think it hardly possible
that I could make the trip ihrough to
New York without a stop. My machine
will not carry enough gasoline. But now
I'm going to have thnt biir machine nnd
I'm going to try it all over again."
Speaking of her machine. Miss I.nw
pointed laughingly across the field to
where her biplane rested in the shadow
of tho huge aeroplane Victor Carlstrom
used when he attempted the flight be
tween Chicago and Now Yotk.
The sturdy old-fashioned machine
with which Misa Iaw shattered Carl
Strom's record was not half as large aa
the Curtiss monster that Carlstrom had
left on the aviation field. The email
machine' is barely one hundred horse
power, while that of Carlstrom is cap
able of two hundred.
Speaking of her flight from Bingham
ton to Governor's Inland Miss Law snld
it was about as risky an undertaking as
she had ever faced.
"It was so foggy," she declared, "it
was almost impossible for me to see
where I was going. There were times
when I skimmed over the New York
houses only 100 foet up. It certainly
gave me plenty of thrills."
On the cuff of one of the nvlutricc's
gloves wns a tiny map. She had drawn
it herself and outlined almost a perfect
course from Chicago. She had jotted
down on a slip of paper pasted along
side, the names of the towns over which
she passed, together with other data for
the records of tho Aero club.
Holds American Record.
"It was awfully hard making head
way," she said. "There wos a strong
head wind blowing against me. I hadn't
taken on any gasoline nt Binghnmton.
The strength of the wind slowed me up
quite a bit, nnd when 1 finally located
Governors Island through the haze I dis
covered there wos not another drop of
gasoline in my tank. With my engine
shut off, I volplaned to ft landing. If
there had been another milo for more
travel, I would buve been in a bad
way." .
Miss Law declared the had absolutely
no trouble with her machine. It behaved
nicely all tho way 'for her.
Officials of tho Aero club of Am
erica, which sanctioned the flight, were
enthusiastic over Miis Law's flight.
She paid all the expenses of the flight,
but asked an official sanction for the
trip so it might be made a record.
Miss Law's feat was uchieved on the
anniversary of the day she received her
pilot's license, November 2(1, 1912. Be
ing a sister of Hodman Law, the para
chute jumper, she had plenty of family
nerve to help her when she decided to
do stunts with a flying machine.
This is the first distance fight he
ever attempted, but she has been nink-

Attacked Her As She Was
. Washing Dishes Took
Poison and Died
Scat'lo, Wash., Nov. 20. Miss Alice
Carey, age 30, is near death with three
bullet wounds in her body fired by her
sister, Mrs. Margaret Hartmrrti, who
afterward committed suicide by taking
poison, during a fit of temporary in
sanity Sunday morning.
The tragedy was enacted on the dairy
ranch o Kobert Hurtman, husband of
the dead womany near Redmond.
Both women were graduates of the
University of Michigan. Their parents
live in Sandusky, Ohio.
At the Lakeside sanitarium at Kirk
land today, Miss Carey, Br. George H.
Davis, her physician and the husband
advanced only tho theory of insanity
to explain the affair.
Miss Carey was washing dishes in the
kitchen, she said, and Kobert Hnrtmau
nnd his father were working outside.
Mrs. Hnrtman walked into tho kitch
en, and fired tho first shot into her
i sister's back. Miss Carey turned. Two
more bullets in quick succession enter
ed her nMlomen.
Her sister turned and fled upstirs
where she took formalin, and, the phy
sician says probably died instantly.
In the United States Lies Sole
- Hope of Ameliorating
Conditions
London, Nov. 20. England in today
seeking some means of reprisal against
Germany for "enslavement" oil Bel
gium's men. Not since tho execution
of Miss Edith ('a veil has there been
such a wave of popular indignation as
that which Is sweeping the country over
fresh details of the Teutonic plan of
giving employment to the Belgian civ
il population by deporting them to Ger
many. It is realized that' with the United
States rests the only hope of interces
sion to prevent a clean sweep from the
desolated nation of all its manhood.
Stories of fathers and sons purted forci
bly from their wives nnd mothers and
other loved ones by German soldiery
have served to fan it into a fever heat.
Three hundred thousand male Bel
gians above the age of 17 are affected
by tho 'employment " orders from Ber
lin. So far at lenst 4 .",000 of thc.se have
been transported from their homes to
Germany, that they may be given em
ployment according' to the German ex
planation Tho transfers are taking place
at the rate of two thousand a duy.
Information today received via Hol
land asserts pleas avail nothing and
that in tifveral instances, where those
pleat wero more than usually forcible,
German comundera ruthlessly enforced
their orders and in addition imposed
further tax burdens as an example to
those who oposed the military machine.
The town of Touruni, it was declared,
had been fined two hundred thousand
marks (.10,000) for "arrogance with
out precedent" in thus opposing the
employment orders.
Copies of the notice to Belgians rc
quiring their assembly nt certain con
centration points for this weeding out
of able bodied workmen have been re
ceived in Holland.
HOKN'S CASB ADVANCED
Washington, Nov, 2'l. The supreme
court today granted a motion to ad
vance for argument the case of Werner
Horn, alleged dynamiter und German
army officer.
Horn is nccuaed of trying to blow up
the Canadian international bridge at
the Cunniliau boumlury iu Maine. He
asked a writ of habeas'corpus, cliiimmg
tho offense charged against him is of
military character and ono for which
he cannot be tried in the ordinary
courts. The court assigned the case

HEIGHTENS DANGER
Magnificent Fighting of Serb
ians WinsNo Changes
: On Somme Front
London, Nov. 20 With rain and slee
interfering with full resumption of op
erations along the Somme, it was tho
Balkans that furnished most of the bat
tle news today. Additional advices
served to inccrase the brilliance of Gen
eral Serrail's French-Russinn-Italian-Serbinn
victory in the taking of Mona
stir. It is now doubted here that tha
German-Bulgarian forces can make com
plete escape from the encircling of tsu
allied flunking movement. Desperata
fighting is proceeding as the allies strive)
to close in still further on tho retreat-
ng Teutons. Roads churned into a seat
of mud from snow and rain will, it m
believed, make it impossible for tha
Teutonic forces to proceed with suf
ficient haste in their retrent to acbieva
a complete withdrawal of forces and
etpupmeut. ,
Moreover, it appears thnt far from.
being content with mere occupation of
the city, tho allied forces ore still
thrusting forward In their drive. Prilcp,
to which city the enemy is withdraw
ing, i about 24 miles to the north. Tha
way Is for the most part across level
ground, with very few natural defensive
features. . The allied occupancy or po
sitions along the Cerna river bend gives
them a fulcrum for their lever to forca
clearance of the plain. .
Military critics here today agreed
that the capture of Monastir is ot tho
greatest of importance. Diplomotiely
most of the credit is given to the her-
bians for the victory. It was their
splendid fighting along the Cerna Deud
which compelled the enemy to ubanuon
their southern defenses, enabling- ad
vance due north of the rrench auu iios
sian troops. Ejected from their own.
country a year ago by i'icld Uarshu-t
Von Mackensen's tremendous drive,
forced to 'flee in disorder, the regimeats
scattered, their equipment what littla
thoro was for the most part abandon
ed, the Serbians have been transformed
in a brief 12 months into a formidutila
army with new arms and equipment and
tho splendid tutorship of Irene h troops
operating with them us brothers in
arms.
It la expected hero that the Monastir
victory will have Important effect ia
relieving the German pressure against
Rumania a pressure that has bee re
garded gravely of late. The London,
press does not hesitate to call the situa
tion of the Humanians " jrecuriona."
