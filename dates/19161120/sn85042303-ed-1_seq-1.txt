London, Nov. 20. The fall
of Monastir on the anniversary
of its capture by the Serbians
from the Turks is hailed by
London papers as of consider
able political and military im
portance. It is argued that as
Bulgaria's main object in en
tering the war was the posses
sion of Macedonia, the loss of
the Macedonian capital must
give the Bulgarians a sense of
failure, while Serbia, it is fur
ther contended, will be greatly
encouraged by the city s fall.

pied by the Serbians, to whom
is given the greater share of
credit for the capital's capture

Thought He Had Committed Murder.
I4ite Saturday night a negro called
Sheriff Garrett and informed him
that he had shot another darkey and
wanted to surrender to the authori
ties. He was taken to the jail and
when being examined by the sheriff
as to the circumstances surrounding
the case, Mrs. Garrett arrived upon
the scene and for a moment was an
interested listener. After the fright
ened negro had recounted in great
detail how the other "coon" had died,
Mrs. (iarrett informed her husband
that the supposed deceased was a
rather lively corpse as he had. been
to their home but a few moments be
fore to seek the gen Ices of the
sheriff and wanted to have the sup
posed murderer, who was reciting de
tails arrested. The negro was rather
elated to find that Instead of a
charge of murder being lodged against
him It would probably be a case of
plain assault with a deadly weapon.
