U. S. Experts Will Do It; First
Call Given Normal Graduates
in Employing Teachers is
Termed "Narrow"; Exclus
ion of Competent Tutors
v From Mainland Institutions
Believed Unjustified, Unwise
A careful and courteously-worded
yet pointed criticism of Hawaii's nor
mal school system and attitude to
i ward employment of . teachers has
been sent by the College Club of Hono-
lulu to Governor Pinkham. Superin
tendent of Public Instruction Kinney
Yand each of the commissioners of pub
lie instruction.
The letter, signed by the officers of
the College Club and by the members
of the club's "Committee on Local In
terests." declares the policy of the de
partment of public instruction is "nar
row" as to the employment of Ameri
can teachers" from the mainland, and
In other respects, all ot which are de
".. tailed. . .... V:.. .
Here are some of the points of a
communication which. It Is expected,
heralda an" agitation directed toward
the radical change of several of -the
department's policies:
College Club has taken an active
interest In the public schools and In
the prospects of . young Islanders who
wish to study elsewhere and return
to teach here; ajso In the prospects
of competent. teacheVa from the main
land who with to teach, here.
At present,.. Territorial Normal
School has aa admlaslon. system re
jected by 39 Out of 48 states and beirfg
abolished in virtually all the others.
Amtrlcanlaatlon of Hawaii's alien
population ia-tlmltad by "our narrow
policy" of discrimination in favor of
Normal School graduates.
Recent VPch of. Superintendent
- Kinney said to enunciate the policy
of the department as In favor of the
Normal School furnishing all teachers
for territory, In primary and grammar
grades at least, -
Territory should abandon "Insular
ity" and take part In nation-wide edu
cational plan for interstate recognition
of credentials of teachers.
Earnest request made for a "Fed
eral School Survey" under the direc
tion of the bureau of edition, depart
. mentr of education. The bureau will
send three or, four experta to make
ithe survey here, the territory to pay
the traveling and other expenses, and
the federal bureau the salaries, of the
experts. ' .. V
The letter to "the governor, superin
tendent of public instruction, and com
missioners of public instruction fol
lows: ' ' v
"Honolulu, T.-IU Nov. 15. 1916.
"Since its beginning some ten years
ago, the College Club has watched
with constant Interest the work of the
public schools In tb,l. territory. Among
its members are many mothers of
famllies-tho8e who have taught and
those now teaching. The club would
not discourage any child in an am
bition to prepare for teaching in the
public schools, of this territory. This
applies to the child of the Japanese
or Chinese coolie,' tbe humblest white
or Hawaiian laborer; but it also ap
plies with equal force to the child
born of educated American parents,
who covet for It the best training our
nation oTfers. Going from Island
homes,' such students are even now
seeking in mainland college and pro
fessional school an education as
teachers, comparable,, in seriousness,
to that sought by their fellow students
as prospective doctors or lawyers.
When the financial needs cannot be
N met by the individual alone, through
its loan' fund this club Las helped,
and is now oelping, island girls to
- complete their college work.
I Speaks for Young Islanders
"The College Club makes no plea for
cultured amateurs In primary, gram
mar or high school; but for young
islanders, who have added profession
al training to their high school dlplo
u ma and college degree, thia club now
Vvspeaks. At preeent they are rated by
the department as inferior to the grad
uates of'.the local Normal' school;' they
lose their status as islanders and are
subjected to conditions reserved for
malihinis; neither in salary or in
: other conditions of employment are
they on an equality with locally
trained graduates; their high school,
college and higher professional work
are not assets, but stand against them.
Trained Heathers" Not Jobs
"Moreover, the College Club would
speak not only for these oar very
own but for all thoroughly equipped
teachers, no matter what state gave
them birth and the training necessary
to make them of use in a class room.

NATIONAL GUARD CAMP, RED

encampment of the 1st Regiment, N.

in point of attendance of any previous

marched from the armory to the camp

was made and the life in camp was
running as smoothly as if it was an
everyday occurrence with 'the guardsmen.-

Inter-Island Sailors Go On Strike
A majority of Japanese sailors of the Inter-Island Steam Navigation
Company walked cut this afternoon and at 3 o'clock the situation looked
as though it might result in a partial tieup of Inter-Island boats scheduled to
leave late today. The Maui and Mauna Loa are due to steam for Kauai
and Maui ports at 5 this afternoon. Whether they will leave on time is
doubtful.'...
So far as could be learned this afternoon the Japanese went to lunch at
noon and failed' to return to work. At 3 o'clock only one or two Japanese
were handling cargo on the Maui and the Mauna Loa, and Japanese sea
men on other boats were also scarce.
"I have had a report of seme Japanese walking out this afternoon,"
said Norman E. Cedge, acting general manager, at 2:30, "but works seems
to be going on as usual. I do not know what steamers are affected." The
total number of Japanese employed by the Inter-Island on its steamers is
close ;o 150. " ;. ' 4 .
This afternoon's sudden strike of Japanese seamen is the result of re
quests made by them several weeks ago for a second increase in wages. At
the time of the stevedores' strike the company voluntarily granted an in
crease of 25 cents a day, but the men asked for another and larger raise,
which they have not been given.
James Hakuole, who has been acting as representative of the sailors,
said. he had not advised a strike, but had sought to get views of men and a
reply from the company. .
LEHER WRITTEN
HIGH COST OF MATERIAL CAUSES RISE IN BRITISH PAPERS
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 20. Representatives of British newspapers to

throughout the country.
SHORTAGE OF MEN IN U. S. NAVY LIMITS PRACTISE
'-WASHINGTON. D. C., -Nov. 20. Target practise in the U. S. navy this
winter will be limited to first-line ships. Admiral Strauss, chief of the ord
nance bureau, informed the house committee on naval affairs today that this
is the case because of a shortage of men. Steps arc being taken to increase
the personnel under the new law.
UNION LABOR OBJECTS TO SUPREME COURT DECISION
BALTIMORE, Maryland, Nov. 20. The American Federation of Labor
today unanimously accepted a recommendation of a committee which de
clares, "Any injunction dealing with the relationship between employer and
employe'based on the dictum that 'labor is property' will be treated as
usurpation and disregarded, whatever the consequence." The recommenda
tion is made in connection with the report en a recent action of the Massa
chusetts supreme court which decided unconstitutional an injunction law
and which classified labor a3 property.
FIELD CREW OWN CONCLUSION AND PUT IN REPORT
H. Gooding Field, special auditor for the public utilities commission in
its investigation of the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company, drew his
own conclusion about what the big shipping firm did with a "depreciatioii
fund' of $132,020.70. He said this afternoon under not cross-examination
from Attorney L. J. Warren of the Inter-Island that he got it out of his
head. "I didn't look in the books to see if the surplus was increased," he
said. ' .
Field said that the statement was incorrect, "in the light of testimony
given here." He admitted that it should be stricken from the report, but
still maintained that deducting from the capital assets and Wiping out the
depreciation fund was a most unusual act of bookkeeping. He read from
an accounting text book that he had studied in the University of Califor
nia to the effect that "a depreciation fund must be a real thin?, unless in
deed the books lie." He took for granted the "fun J ' was real, he said,
and so concluded when it dropped out '..it must have gone to surplus.
BY COLLEGE CLUB
"I have answered the letter, thank
ing the club for its courtesy," said
Henry W. Kinney, superintendent of
public instruction, this afternoon, re
ferring to a communication from the
College Club published elsewhere in
today's Star-Uulletin.
"I believe th?t our local graduates
should have the preference over grad
uates elsewhere. Hut these who have
graduated from professional institu
tions of similar value on the coast,
whether they be Hcnolulu-born or not,
are pair on the same basis and treat
ed the same as graduates of our own
schools.
"It has been the custom to employ
no one from the mainland until the
local supply of teachers is exhausted;
I think that tho custom is an excellent
one arid I hope that the number of
local Normal school graduates will
continue to increase." "V ' ;
