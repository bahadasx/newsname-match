DICKINSON TO
GET NORMAL IF
UNHJSWRONG
Attorney General Says the
Measure Must Have Ma
jurity of all Votes.
SENATOR McBRIDE
SAYS IT IS NOT SO
Declares that Only Majority
Cast for Particular Is
sue is Needed.
(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D., Nov. 20.—If State
Senator-Elect M. L. McBrlde la right
and Attorney General H. J. Linde is
wrong In his interpretation of the
statute governing the vote on consti
tutional amendments, it is safe to say
that Dickinson has won its fight for a
normal school by a very safe margin.
And everyone In the Slope country,
with no desire to "get anything" on
Attorney General Linde, but In sym
pathy with Dickinson and the needs
of the Slope country, is most earnest
ly praying that in this one instance
the attorney general may have erred.
When the early returns began to
come in, Mr. Linde was asked for an
opinion as to what constituted a ma
jority vote on constitutiona.1 amend
ments and on referendum measures.
Mr. Linde advised that constitutional
amendments, to carry, must poll a
majority of all the votes cast at the
•lection where submitted but that
referendum measures would carry
with a majority of all the votes cast
oh the particular question.
McBrlde Dissents.
Now comes Senator McBrlde with a
very vigorously dissenting opinion..
Mr- McBrlde writes:
"Article 202 of the constitution of
North Dakota provides in very explicit
words that it shall be 'approved and.
ratified after the people by a majority
of the electors voting thereon hav«
"approved, and shall become a part of
the constitution. This has been patt
ed upon by the supreme court.inaev
eral cases. I only refer to one, which
is in the nineteenth North Dakota, at
page 41. in the case of the State vs.
Blaisdell, et al. The Bupreme court,
speaking through Its chief justice,
Spalding, says: 'We, however, may
mention one other provision, that re
lating to the amendments of the con
stitution. Section 202 required pro
posed amendments to be submitted to
the people, and if they approve and
ratify, "by a majority of the electors
voting thereon," the amendment be
comes part of the constitution. This
section permits the amendment of the
constitution by only a majority of the
electors voting on the proposed
amendment.'
Minot Proposition.
Mr. McBrlde further advises that
recourse to the records will reveal the
fact that the Minot normal school
proposition did not receive over one
third of all votes cast at the general
election, but the amendment carried
on a majority of the votes cast upon
the particular proposition.
Undo to Investigate.
Linde admits there is a question as
to the Interpretation of the section,
and he has promised a more thorough
investigation.
Reports indicate that the normal
school proposition has received a ma
jority of the votes cast on the ques
tion in a majority of the counties.
Barnes county, wherd is located the
Valley City normal, is one of the im
portant exceptions. Mcintosh also
registered a small majority against
the proposition- Grand Gorks gave
the amendment a good majority, as
did other important counties.
The vote from ten counties—Ran
som, Burleigh, Barnes, Grand Forks,
Sioux, Traill, Golden Valley, McHenry
and Walsh, according to the official
report of the county ccanvasBing
boards, as filed with the secretary of
state is.
Por the normal 13,603
Against normal 11,140
Majority for 2,463
Ransom, Traill, Sioux, Grand
Forks, Golden Valley and Burleigh
county strongly favored the Dickinson
proposition. Walsh, Barnes, Pembina
and McHenry voted against it. A ma
jority of the counties most favorable
to Dickinson are yet to be heard from,
and there is no question that the
Dickinson lead will be materially in
creased.

Washington, Nov. 20.—A portentous
and complicated international situa
tion now faces President Wilson and
for the next few weeks will engage his
attention and that of his advisers to
the practical exclusion of all but the
most urgent subjects.
In the last days of the campaign
Secretary of State Lansing frequently
spoke of the necessity of postponing
action on the more delicate interna
tional questions because the uncer
tainty of the outcome of the political
contest had a direct bearing on the
success or failure of some of the ad
ministration 'policies. From now on
the president expects to deal with all
foreign questions without embarrass
ment and he is receiving from his ad
visers a summary of the outstanding
issues so essential to taking stock of
the basic situation which must be met,
now that international relations have
returned to their place of prime Im
portance.
While It is not evident that there
will be any fundamental change, free
dom from fear that any m'ove at all

Winnipeg, Man., Nov. 20.—At 11:30
today the door of Stony Mountain
penitentiary closed on Thomas Kelly,
wealthy Winnipeg contractor, who ar
rived there at that hour by automo

The feeling here is that Kelly will

a witness at the former cabinet min
ister's second trial in January.
Kelly Is past 60 years, but has tak

London, Nov. 20.—In view of the
reiterated German declaration that
the decisive battle of the war would
be fought In the Transylvanian Bal
kans there is added interest in the
fighting of that section. Most of the
reports available are from German
sources. Berlin dispatches say that
on the Transylvanian front the Aua
tro-German armies at almost all
points continue to make progress
against the Russian and Rumanian
forces or to hold them back without
gains when they attack. The latest
reports from Berlin say the Teutonic
allies have forced the narrow moun
tain passes leiading to the Wallachian
plain of Rumania, opening a way for
a oampaign against Bucharest from
the north.
From 'November 1 to November 18

"The effects of General von Falken*
hayn's. unrelenting pressure upon the
outlets from the Predeal, Torssebur
ger and. Rothernburn passes now are
making themselves felt in neighbor
ing sectors, namely, in the northern
Rumanian and Wallachian Carpath
ians," writes the miHtary critic .of- the
Overseas News agency. "After the
failure of their offensive in the Pre-,
deal area, -the Rumanians were' com
pelled to confine themselves to the,
defensive, but the demands .of even
this form of warfare are now almost
too much to be supplied by. the forces
at their command..
".The Rumanian lines are being
continuously drawn back in the cen
ter, near Predeal and Campulung
and south of Rothenburn (Rothe
Trum pass. They are endeavoring
to offset this menace by attacks in
nearby sectors of the front. At the
beginning the attacks-for this purpose
.was -launched to the west of the prin
cipal passes and in the vicinity of
the hard pressed center, as in the
Booza valley, to the east of the center
and in the Jiul valley to the west. In
the former valley'conditions caused
the fighting to be confined to guerilla
warfare, while the Jiul valley the Ger
mans, who at the beginning confined
themselves to the defensive have
since November 10 been on the of
fensive in their advance.
Russians Also Weakened.
"Under the extension of the Ger
man pressure, the Rumanian offensive
continued to fall away toward the
flanks. This is seen in the result of
the recently reported engagements
near Orsova, where Archduke Charles
Francis made 1,600 prisoners as well
as In the extremely costly attacks of
the Russians in the Oitus valley on
November 13-14. which were only
made iii consequence of the pressure
agalnst'the principal passes. Indirect
ly connected with this are the en
gagements near Folst-Krasnolesna on
the Narayuvka in Galicia, where the
Russians attempted In vain to keep
the forces of the central powers tied
up in an effort to relieve Rumania.
The Russian armies of Generals
Brusiloff and LyaileVy in consequence
of the exhaustion of their human ma

and war machinery, which Is •-every

longer capable of any action on a

WILD STORIES
OF MASSACRES
BY VILLA MfN
Gen. Trevino Reported to
Have Lost 1,000 Troops
in Clever Trap.
REFUGEES TELL OF
AMERICANS SLAIN
Villa Said to Have Cast Live
Babies into Flames in
Parral Raid.
El Paso, Tex., Nov. 20.—Sensational
stories of massacres, battles and out
rages of Villa bands are being brought
to border points by Chinese and other
refugees, but few of them can be
verified in any way.
One report is that General Jacinto
Trevino, commander of the Carranza
army of the north, was trapped in
Bachimba canyon by Villa troops who
inflicted a decisive defeat on the de
facto government forces. After his
defeat, "^revlno returned to' Chihua
hua City with the remnant of his
army.
The Villa force, it is1 related, allowed
three tijoop trains .carrying Carranza
soldiers to enter the canyon and then
cut the line both north and south
The soldiers on the three trains were
practically annihilated and the trains
and equipment captured by the ban
dits.
ueneral Trevino was traveling on
the rear military train and succeeded
in escaping the slaughter and returned
to the capital with not more than
1,000 men. He had approximately
2,000 troops when he left the capital
to take the field against Villa.
An unidentified American was killed
when a Villa band took Jiminez and
four Americans were seen under a
guard of bandits at Parral during
viiia'ji occupation of that town, ac
cording to reports believed by fed
eral agents to be authentic.
Refugees further state that the dis
trict between Parral and Jiminez has
been cleared by Villa's followers ot
more than two hundred Chinese.
The American killed at Jiminez
was described as about 60 years old
and known to be from Torreon on his
way to Chihuahua City. He was mur
dered, said the refugees, in the Ji
minez hotel and his body lay for some
time in front of the building when
after being robbed of clothing and
valuables it was placed on a bonfire.
The same refugees also say that
two Mexican women who had mar
ried Chinese and their live half-caste
children were found and thrown alive
into the fire and cremated in sight of
the crowd.. The bodies of seven mur
dered Chinese, according to the same
authority, were seen in the streets of
the town.
Two Mexicans who escaped from
Parral affirm that they saw four
Americans there under a Villa guard.
Another report brought to the border
was to the effect that the bodies of
35 gypsies of both sexes were seen
on the roadside near Parral, mur
dered and robbed by Villa bandits.
All foreigners that Villa has caught,
except the Japanese and Germans,
have been put to death, the reports
agree, and- even the Germans are said
to have suffered at least in the In
stance of Theodore Hoemuller of Par
ral. Various reports of Hounuiller's
death have been received here during
the past week.
Chinese refugees reaching Juarez
from Jiminez state that all the Ameri
cans, Chinese, Arabs, Germans and
other foreigners who remianed in Par
ral when Villa took possession of the
city were massacred. United States
government officials have been exert
ing every energy to obtain informa
tion from the foreign colonies of Par
ral.
second Chinese refugee said at
least 20 Chinese had been killed In
Parral and that 15 Arabs, Hebrews
and 'Syrians had been put to death.
Five of the eleven Americans left two
days before the town was evacuated
and reached Culiacan.
In addition to these five there re
mained in Parral, according to min
ing men, the following Americans:
Jacob Meyers, E. W. Palmer, William
Scott—who is not the son of General
Hugh, L. Scott. General Scott's son,
Merrill, having left Parral a month
before—Henry Schafer, R. P. Lowell
and Dr. Thomas Flannagan.
Chihuahua City is said to be in a
state of panic and many are said to
be on the verge of starvation. Dis
patches from that city say the van
guard of Infantry commanded by Gen
eral Osuna which left there for the
south came Into contact with a Villa
band near Santa Rosalia and captured,
several, prisoners. Important docu
ments are said to have been taken
from the prisoners.
The departure of General Trevino
-for- the field has been delayed for
-military reasons it la announced here.
tit Great unrest exists In Saltlllo over
ifear of an 'attack by Villa forces.
Among refugees reaching Laredo were
six men employed, by the Coahuila
and Zaeatecas irmllway who said they
had been ordered from the country.

SERBS AGAIN
HAVE CAPITAL
ON OWN SOIL
Entry into Monastir on the
Anniversary its Fall
to Serbs in 1912.
BERLIN SAYS CITY
BEEN ABANDONED
Recognize Political Effect of
Losing it But Military
Expediency comes First
London, Nov. 20.—After havinff
been for months men without a coun
try, the Serbians are again to estab
lish their capital on native soil. Mon
astir, in Southern Serbia, for which
the entente forces have been strug
gling since the advance from their
base at Saloniki began, has been evac
uated by the German and Bulgarian
forces and occupied by the French
and a considerable number of Serbs,
on the anniversary of the taking of
the town from the Turks in 1#12, by
the Serbians.
A Itoutcr dispatch from JSaloniki
that on Saturday the" Serbian
troops gained fresh victories in the
Cerna region, the German-Bulgarian
forces making a disorderly retreat in
the direction of Prilep, north of Mon
astir.
I Many Prisoners and Trophies.
"The Serbians," the dispatch adds,
"took a great number of prisoners and
trophies. The pursuit continues.
"Great fires were visible in Monas
tir where violent explosions were
heard. The entente allied troops to
day (Sunday) entered Monastor—the
temporary capital of Serbia will be
immediately established at Monastir.
Considerable forces of Serbians are
with the entente allied troops who
have occupied the town."
Serbs Given Credit.
The Serbians are given the lion's
share of the honor for the fall pt
Monastir. The capture of Hill 1212
by the Serbs and their rapid advance
to Hill 1378, threatening the Bulgar
ians' only avenue of retreat along
Prilep road, is considered the main
factor in forcing the hasty evacuation
of the city.
Military opinion insists that the
allies must now advance toward
Prilep, using Monastir as a base and
from there to Negotin on the Vardar
river. From the latter town they
claim the Bulgarian positions east of
Cerna could be outflanked and the
frontier passes opened to the allies
forces, which now are engaged north
wst of Saloniki.
One of War's Decisive Events.
The fall of Monastir is considered
as clearly showing the superiority of
the allies over the German-Bulgar
forces in view of the formidable de
fenses which had been created around
the city.
Paris. Nov. 20.—Newg of the occu
pation by French troops of the Ser
bian town of Monastir was received
in Paris as one of the most important
of the late developments of the war.
The Temps points out that the suc
cess is not only of immense moral
value but is likely to have a great in
fluence on subsequent developments in
the Balkan campaign as the place
commands all the practical routes be
tween the Aegean sea and the Adri
atic sea.
The fall of Monastir, the newspaper
says, involves the early fall of Ochri
da, twenty-five miles northwest of the
occupied town and the region of the
Macedonian lakes and assures an ef
fective junction of the army at Salon
iki and the Italian troops operating
in Albania.
GERMANS MINIMIZE
FAIL OF MONASTIR
Berlin, Nov. 20.—(By wire to the
Associated Press via SayvlUe, N. Y.)—
The Macedonian city of Monastir was
evacuated during the night by the
German and Bulgarian troops, who
retired to prepared positions further
north. They thus withdrew from
highly unfavorable positions In the
plain, where they were exposed to
artillery fire from the heights to the
south and southeast of the town.
The news of the evacuation of
Monastir does not come as a surprise,
as the Associated Press was Informed
some days ago by the military au
thorities that the question as to
whether Monastir's political Import
ance was great enough to Justify th«
military Sacrifices necessary to defend
the town was being' weighed by the
general's staff and that military con
siderations probably would prevail.
Monastir Is located at the bottom
of a'bowl surrounded on an sides bif
dominstlng heights, it was therefore
tactically extremely unfavorable^ a*
