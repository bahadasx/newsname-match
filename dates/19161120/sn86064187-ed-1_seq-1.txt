pany says the German, Austro Hungar
ian, Bulgarian and Tutkish minister,
to Greece have been informed by Vice
Admiral Dn Four net, commander id
the allied fleet that they must depart
from Greece hy Wednesday.
The victory nf General Sarrail's
armies on the western end of the Mace
donian (rout which resulted esterday
in the capture of Monastir, is being
vigorously followed up.
Force Still In Retreat.
The German Bulgarian forces which
evacuated the city as the result of the
successful flanking movement hy the
French and Serbians, are still in full
retreat, Paris reports today, and are
being relentlessly .pursued. Already
several towns north of Monastir have
been taken by entente troops pushing
out from the city and prisoner and
war material captured.
Tress dispatches depict Monastir as
virtually destroyed by fire and explo
sions and deserted hy the population
and describe the retreat of its defend
ers as a rout. Berlin, however, declares
the new positions chosen north of Mon
astir were occupied without pressure
being felt and adds that new German
forces have arrived on the scene. It
asserts further thatn Serbian attempts
to advanre along the Moglrnica front,
east of the Monastir region, were de
feated. Rumanian Position Precarious.
The position of Rumania appears in
creasingly precarious. General von
Falkenhayn's armies are continuing to
force their way southward from the
Transylvanian border and Petrograd
admits a further retirement of the Ru
manians in the J i til valley region. Neat

the Rumanian troops appear to be of
fering their most stubborn resistance,
nut Berlin declares the Russian attacks
have been delivered hy poorly organised
forces and have been fruitless.
The bad weather along the front In
France apparently has brought opera
tions to a standstill. Neither London
nor Paris reports operations of impor
tance overnight. The Itritish failure to
gain ground yesterday in attempts
north of the Ancre near Miraumom
and between Sent and Heaucourt, and
the rwilse of a French attack on St
