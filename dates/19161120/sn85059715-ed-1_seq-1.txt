CHARLESTON. Nov. 20.?West
Tlrginin's specially convened session
>f the legislature immediately upon
ts meeting Monday listened to the
;overnor'B message which was a cauitic
arralgnnielt of political corruplon,
which it was charged was prevnent
in the conduct of the election on
November 7 and also recommended
:hanges in the election law that are
loped to remedy the situation.
The message was rend in the senite
and in the house amid the moat
ntense interest in the expectation
:hnt the governor would make specifically
some of the charges touched
apon In the call for the special session.
The governor declared it was
not his intention or desire to advocate
anything revolutionary or obnoxious
or anything that will handi
lap "the incoming executive in bis
Inherent right but to see that evenhanded
justice-is "had, namely that
an opportunity be given the legislature
to protect the elective officials
against those threats which have
been ma'de almost daily since November
7, the day of election.
"'By methods as reprehensible as
they are corrupt, by bribery, open
intimidation and open repeating of
unlawful voters in certain counties
of the state," the governor said, in
his message, "the desperate and unscrupulous
effort to get possession of
the executive machinery of the state
has apparently succeeded. I have
made some investigation of these
conditions and further investigation
will be made that citizens ofNWest
Virginia may know just how bad
these conditions really are. It has
come to my knowledge that it is the
purpose of those who have made efforts
to see that all costs for their
own base uses, the executive power
of the state to ruthlessly and In violation
of all law continue their purpose
by contesting the seats of the
duly elected Republican officials and
wrongly depriving them of their office
by removing appointive officials
with flxed terms of office, regardless
of their fitness or form of service to
the state and by other similar acts,
subversive to good government and
contrary to the welfare of the state.
"I believe my plain duty, after
reading of such revolutionary threats
from one who aspires to be governor
to risk no chance of what the future
has in store for those who have resTinnelhlA
clonnrvlniiira -no.

SHORTAGE
Of Canned Goods is Complained
Of by Retail Grocers in
New York City.
.
(BY AtffOClATffO P*KS?)
NEW YORK, Nov. . 20.?Retail
grocers complain of a shortage of
canned goods and some predict that
ouTy one-third of the normal supply
will be available in New York this
winter. Manhattan grocers are running
out of their supplies of standard
widely-advertised canned products,
declared a trustee of the Retall
Grocers Association, and are unable
to replenish their stock.
One reason advanced for the short
age is tnat many onne oig canning
factories, especially on the Atlantic
seaboard, have contracted to send
their entire output to the warring
nations In Europe.
