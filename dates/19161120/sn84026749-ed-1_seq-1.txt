sv, 20. (Energetic pursuit
Tonic-Bulgarian army re-
Monastlr is nrocecdlnit.
according to the Serbian official stato-
hwnt today, mentioning Saturday's
operations.
"News of the liberating of Monastlr,
the ancient city of Serbian Macedonia,
hu caused proud satisfaction and great
joy in tho Serbian army," tho state
ment asserted.
It la now doubted here that tho Gorman-Bulgarian
forces can make com
pute escape from tho encircling vise
of the allied flanking movement. Des
perate fighting is proceeding as the
allies strive to closo In still further
on the retreating Teutons. Roads
churned Into a sea of mud from snow
and rain will, It is believed, make it
impossible for Teutonic forces to pro
ceed with sufficient haste In their re
treat to accomplish a complete with
drawal of forces and equipment.
Retreat la Difficult.
Moreover, It appears that far from
being contont with nioro occupation
of the city, tho allied forces nro still
thrusting forward in their drive. Prl
Ip, to which city the enemy Is with
drawing. Is about twenty-four miles to
tha north. Tho way is for tho most
part across level ground, with very
few natural defensive features. Tho
allied occupancy of positions along
the Cerna river bend given them ft
fulcrum for their lover to force clear
ance of the plain.
Military critics here today agreed
that the capture of Monastlr Is of thn
greatest Importance. Diplomatically
most of tho credit Is given to tho Her
bUni'orthe victory. It was their
JUrlendld flghtln-a!ong the Cerm
bend which compelledtho enemy to
abandon their southern defense, en
abling advance due north of tho
French and Russian troops.
Serb Army Regenerated.
Ejected from their own country a
year ago by Field Marshal von Mack
ensen's tremendous drive, forced to
fie In disorder, their regiments scat
tered, their equipment what little
there was for tho most part aban
doned, tho Serbians have been trans
formed In a brief twelve months into
a formidable army, with new arms
and equipment and tho splendid tu
torship of French troops operating
with them as brothers-Inarms.
It Is expected here that the Monas
tlr victory will have Important effect
In relieving the German prossure
against Roumanla a prossuro that
has been regarded gravely of late.
The Ifondon press docs not hesitate to
call the situation of tho Roumanians
precarious.

the hotel keepers of Washington are

Into tho discard as though it had

ning of the new year on January 2.
The action of the Hotel Keepers'
Association of Washington Ih due to
the fact that New Year Dve comes
on Sunday this year.
A N- iesr Kve on Sunday means
no welcome for tho Now Year In ap
proved fashion at the hotels and
restaurants of the city. No regular
year can make Its approach on an
unoffending people nowadays with
out being properly welcomed.
Therefore, the Hotel Keepers' As
sociation, after lue consultation
among Its members and with the
hotel keepers of other cities, has de
cided that the celebration of the com
ing of the New Year will take place
for 1417 after the year has arrived
