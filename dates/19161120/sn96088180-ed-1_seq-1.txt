Washington. Nov. 20. The admin
istration will stand for but little fur
ther delay from the Mexican tide of
the Atlantic City conference. Its pa
tience la at Hie breaking point and
the next four daya may bring Import
ant developments. The Mexicans will
be told emphatically, In language
stripped of all diplomacy, that the
United Statea can not alt In the ses
sions if dilatory, obstructive tactics
are continued.
By such means tbe administration
hopes to force a peaceful agreement
on vexatious problems between the
two nation. The border patrol plan
la but part of what the government
hopea to accomplish. Primarily,
however, protection and ' safety of
American rights and property In Mex
ico la the big problem. ' ;
The United Press learned theae
facts from a trustworthy source to
day. . .t ; ;
What the alternative course Is In
event of rallnre at Atlantle City no

Secretaries .Lane, Lansing and Baker
alone know what It la. But It It free
ly predicted by those close to Mexi
can problems that a ahitt In policy
will be forthcoming which will deal
rather more atrlctly with Mexico than
in tha past.' The administration,
however, la really hopeful that such
Ideaa need not be used; leaders think
that the Mexican commissioners will
be whipped Into line. :
