TO SEND BRITISH WIDOWS
TO OVERSEAS DOMINIONS
Scheme Has Been Completed by the
Salvation Army.
London, Nov. 19. A scheme which
has been under consideration for some
time by the Salvation Army is now
complete for transferring British wid
ows wfth their tamilles to the Over
seas Dominions and to increase facil
ities for the migration of other women
desiring to" go to Dominions when the
war is over, and the abnormal demand
for female labor is exhausted. '
In a recent issue of the 'War Cry"
General Booth intimates that a fund
of one million dollars should be raised
and $360,000 has already been sub
scribed. The Public Trustee has agreed
to act as treasurer of the fund, and the
sum asked for should secure the set
tlement of five thousand widows and
ten thousand children. The work,
which requires careful and gradual
preparation on this side as well as in
the Dominions for t-':e proper settle
ment of tre famileu, would be con
ducted over a period of five years!
Close cooperafon between the Sal
vation Army and the Dominion gov
ernments is already assured, several
of the states have already come for
ward with offers of active support, and
special representatives are being des-
patcnea to tne colonies at once.
General Booth points out that under
the scheme, worthy widows living in
oppressive or unsatisfactory environ
ments, c::n be transferred, free of cost
to themselves, to progressive overseas
communities vh:re there is more el
bow room for the energetic and en
terprising, and where she will be for
tified while making ner way, in the
knowledge that she has the weight of
the Salvation Army at her back.
He sums up the Army's undertaking
on beha:f of the women as follows:
"The Army, will- not advise anyone
to migrate m Vcomc responsible for
the migration of any one who may not
conform with the standards of suita
bility it has set up ' through its long
experience with migration.
"The Army will provide for the re
ception and secure positions in given
localities prior to sailing for all whom
it, may select for ' overseas settlement
under thic scheme.
"TheArmy undertakes the-, svperm- J
sible persons, of the families migrated
ior tour years, or until such time as
the progress of the new settlers in
dicates that such guardianship can be
dispensed with.
"In the event of failure to succeed
In her new environment after four
years trial, a contingency regarded as
remote and exceptional ,the Army will
bring back the widow to th;'s coun
try." General Booth claims that the re
sponsibi!ities thus vclunlarily under
taken on behalf of tlie women read
,ie womr.n rparh
farther and are more comprehensive
man anytmng required by state reg
ulation or an thing that might be at
tempted by any other organization. .

5 Americans Held

DURING THEIR OCCUPATION OF
THE TOWN OF PARRAL
KILL UNKNOWN WOMAN
All Foreigners That Villa Has Caught,
Except the Japanese and Germans,
Have Been Put to Death One
American Among the Number.
El Paso, Texas, Nov. 19. An un
identified woman wag killed when a
Villa - band took Jimenez and four
Americans were seen . under a guard
of bandits at Parral during Villa's
occupation of that town, according to
reports oelieved by federal agents to
be authentic, brought to the border by
refugees.
An American Killed at Jimenez.
" Refugees further state that the dis
trict between Parral and Jimenez has
been cleared by Villa's followers of
more. than 200 Chinese. The Ameri
can killed at Jimenez was described
as about 60 years old and known to
be from Torreon on his way to Chi
huahua City. He was murdered, said
the refugees, in the Jimenez Hotel
and his body lay for some time in
front of the- building. After being
robbed' of clothing and valuables, it
was placed on a bonfire.
Witnessed Outrages.
The same refugees, who claim to
have been witnesses of the outrages,
also say that two Mexican women
who had married Chinese and their
five half-caste children were found
and thrown alive into the fire and
cremated in sight of the crowd. The
bodies of seven murdered Chinese,
according to the same authority, were
seen in the street3 of the town.

dits. Killing Foreigners.

to have suffered, at least in the in
stance of Theodore Hoemuller of Par-'
ral. Various reports of Hoemuller's
death have been received here during
the past week..
TWO WEEKS' TEST '
. . v OF- SCIENTIFIC DIET
To Be Made by Six Men and Six
Women in Chicago.
Chicago, Nov. 19. Six men" and six
women employes of 'he city health de
partment ate their Thanksgiving din
ner today and then gave their solemn
words to eat nothing 'for two weeks
but the scientific dk-t provided by a
public econo'my commission. They will
attempt to demonstrate the theories of
the commission that the high cost of
living is due largely to tha apparent
willingness of tl e public to pay any
price demanded for its luxuries and
that the public's .health as well as Its
purse would be unproved by an mtelli
went diet.
John Dil. Robertson, health commis
sioner, says he expects to feed the
12 for $20 a week, or at a trifle more
than eight cents a meal, or 25 cents a
day.
The squad will weigh in at 8.30
o'clock tomorrow morning. Their
weight will bp carefully watched each
day of the two weoi.s. They will be
given three carefully prepared meals
each day and will be expected to do
their regular work and will be permit
ted to drink only wale.- between meals.
A big commission merchant, who
admitted he had profited by high
prices, Uday attributed the increase
to the supine public. "In former years
if a housewife was asked to pay 40
cents a pound for butler," he saifi,
"she revolted anil useU a cheaper sub
stitute. This year ine pays 0 cents-
"Therein lies the secret of present
high prices. There are liberal stocks
of butter and eggs in cold storage and
the holders have made more money
than they ever expected to make. Still
there is no way to make them sell a
product for 30 cents if they can get 50
for it, and as long as buyers will pay
the advancing prices the price is going
up."

END OF MEXICAN-AMERICAN
CONFERENCE IN SIGHT
Is Entering its Final Phase, Agree
ment or No Agreement.
Washington, Nov. 19. Armed with
President Wilson's complete approval
of his course. Secretary Lane will re
turn to Atlantic City tomorrow.' de
termined to bring the sessions of the
American-Mexican joint commission
to an early conclusion. He still hopes
an agreement as to the border situa
tion can be reached, but it was clear
ly indicated today in official circles
that the joint conference is entering
on its final phase, agreement or no
agreement.
If the commissioners find it impos
sible to formulate a plan, the view
taken here will be that the .prospect
of settling border disputes through di
plomacy will be remote. Officials
make no prediction, however, as to
what steps the Washington govern
ment might find it necessary to take
in that event to insure the safety of
border towns and ranches.
Secretary Lane is understood to
have found President Wilson, Secre
tary Lansing and Secretary Baker in
full accord with him on every point
when he laid before them last night
in the three hour conference at the
White House . a review of the efforts
the American commissioners had made
to reach a settlement.
Mr. Lane said today that he was
well pleased with the results or tne
White House conference but would
not otherwise comment.
It is an open secret that Luis Ca
brera, Carranza minister of finance
and president of the Mexican com
mission, has. proved the stumbling
block in the way of reaching an
agreement.

Foreign Problems
Facing President
WILL TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER
DOMESTIC QUESTIONS
TEUTONIC AND ENTENTE
German Submarine Situation and the
Entente Allied Trade Restrictions Are
the Paramount Issues to be Dealt
With.
Washington. Nov. 19. A nortentoua
and complicated international situa
tion now faces President Wilson and
for the next few weeks will pnra
his attention and that of his advisors,
to the practical exclusion of all but
the most - urgent of domestic sub
jects. . Delicate International Questions.
In the last davs of the enmnnie-n
Secretary Lansing frequently spoke of
the necessity of postponing action on
the more delicate international ques
tions because the uncertainty of the
outcome of the political contest had a
direct bearing on the success or fail
ure of some of the administration pol
icies. Relieved of Embarrassment.
From now on the president expects
to deal with all foreign Questions
without embarrasment and he is re
ceiving from his advisors a summary
of the outstanding issues so essential
to taking stock of the basic situation
which must be met now that inter
national relations have returned to
their place of prime importance. While
t is not evident that there will be any

and Secretary Lansing feel them
selves able to act with a single

on the president's return to Washing

the situation to be.
Submarine Situation.

hand and the entente allied trade re

retaliatory legislation shall be enforced.-
whether the traditional theory
of isolation shall he abandoned for
concerted neutral action, and wheth

peace conference, the trade after the
rar and .the permanent league to en
force peaee? which the president has
accepted in. theoryv . AnaV":dnring the'
rest of the war.' shall America's atti
tude be governed by a decided benev
olence in the interpretation of interna
tional law according to its own best
Interests, or shall It be strictly legal

Five Critical Cases Pending.
Most snecfcicular and disquieting of
the problems is the submarine situa

of six American lives, two others in
