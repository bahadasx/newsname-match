Funston Outlines His
Plans for Carrying the
Villa Chase to Finish
Hears With Gratification That the
War Office Will Not Recall
American Troops
DOES HOT REGARD TASK ACCOMPLISHED
With Villa on Stretcher and in Flight
Believes the End Is Near;
Reyes May Surrender
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 8. Frank surprise was displayed
General Funston 's headquarters todav that serious consideration
had been given the unoffieial suggestion that the American troops
ue wiuwrawn irom .Mexico, and corresponding gratilication was
manifested when it was learned that Secretary Lansing and Secre
tary Jiaker llatly denied that the government was contemplating
such action. General Funston does not regard the task set him of
breaking up "Villa's band or bands" as accomplished. The only
question of doubt created under the terms of his orders rests in
that part of the orders that provides for the removal of the troops
wnenever tne troops ot tlie dc tacto government "are able to re
lieve them of this work." That is a phase of the situation army
Killed 150 Men.
The net result of the three weeks campaign against Villa is a
tilling of a few more than one hundred and fifty of Villa's men
and the extension of a line of American troops approximately four
hnndred miles into Mexico. Villa's organization remains intact so
far as army officers here know. He lias divided it into smaller
units and one of these was attacked and defeated at Guerrero, but
there is evidence that the fugitive chieftain, although r.'li
wounded had possibly traveling on a stretcher as stated in some re-1
pons mat nave reacnea Here, is yet directing m a general way their
movements. General Pershing's reports, infrequent to head
quarters, continued throughout the week to indicate the optimism
of himself and his officers that they soon would overtake Villa or

EL PASO, April 8. Army officials
here do not regard with appre
. (tension the announcement from
Queretaro that the Mexican govern
ment had not granted the American
war department permission to ship
supplies over the Mexican railways.
It was pointed out this privilege
has not been denied by the de facto
government to private parties.
As a result of the liberty extended
to American business concerns
enough hay and oats have been
shipped out of ' Juarei to Casas
Urandes this week to feed the horses
And mules of the expeditionary force
an entire week. Enough coffee and
sugar has been freighted to last the
American troops ten days and other
supplies have been forwarded in
preparation.
It la known that thero is no ban
on commercial shipments via the
Mexican Central railway. That this
road had not been used before has
been due to the fact that privilege
has not been extended for the use of
the Mexican Northwestern westward
from Chihuahua City to Guerrero
and intermediate points.
If, however, General Pershing es
tablishes a new base at Chihuahua
City there will be no need of the rail,

Judge Shive.

OKLAHOMA CITY. April 8."t'et

Arapaho," Is the word that ha scome
to the administration. Judge Shive
has been one ot the leudlng Demo
crats in Custer county and in a recent
speecn announced that he had flopped
to the Republicans. Shive has been
twice elected county attorney in Cus
ter on the Democratic tickt.
"I hate to testify against the party
ui unitii i nave ueen a momber,
Shive said in his speech, "but candor
compels me to tell the truth. I am no
longer a Democrat. There was a time
when the party stood for justice and
equality, but today It iitands for per
jury, politics and plunder.
"I don't mean to say that the rank
and file of the party stand for that.
but I do say that Governor Williams
ana me members of the legislature
stani? for Just such things. They hold
up tnelr hands and swore they would
support the constitution of the United
Ktates and tho state of Oklahoma,
yet from the moment they went Into
office they have been scheming, plan
ning and conspiring, trying to frame
up a way In which they can nullify
the constitution of the L'nued States.
I am through with the Democratic
party. It has no respect for platform
promises and no consideration for the
people who placed it In power."
Judge Shive said he hoped to live
to fight the Democrats as hard In the
future as he had fought against the
Republicans In the past. His criti
cism of the party was on account of
the election law Dassed at the oer.ln.l
session, and he may he able to lead
other Democrats with him. ,
TON, April 8. W. I. A.
ndnrgracht of The Hague,
connected with the Royal Dutch Shell
Oil company and tho Koxuna Petro
leum company, accompanied by Hen
F. Rice of Tulsa, locul attorney fur
the Itoxana, held a long conference
with Indian Commissioner Sells today
upon the oil situation In Oklahoma.
It is understood that matters of Im
portunes dealing with the question of
an adequate supply of oil for govern
ment use In the event of war. were
discussed. Although Mr. Rice refused
to discuss the object of today's con
ference with Commissioners Sells, the
Osage council Is due to arrive in
Washington, Sunday and from pres
ent indications, the Indians will Insist
upon putting up to tho highest bid
ders the oil leases now held by the
Indian Territory Illuminating Oil
compuny, under an extension of the
blanket lease, ordered by Secretary
Ijine which expires April 16.
The department will probably In
sist upon the execution of new oil
leases to the present sublessees In the
Osage nation In conformity with the
resolution adopted by the tribal
council last June, but from rumors
that have proceeded the members of
tho council, the Osagcs will continue
to oppose the wishes of the depart
ment and Ignore the June 17 resolu
tion. No IeUKe Yet.
From departmental sources it is
learned that no plan Is In contempla
tion for the leasing of the unleused
portion of the Osage nation at this
time, although it is understood sev
eral tentative propositions have been
submitted to the department for Its
approval. It Is probable that today's
conierence Detween Commisaloner

may nave naa something to do with
the leasing of the western portion of
the Osage nation for oil nurnnseu al.

ASIIINOTON, April 8. Ger
many's disclaimer of responsi
bility for the destruction of the chan
nel liner Sussex surrounds the posi
tion of the United States In the pres
ent submarine situation with further
difficulties and may turn action, if
any bo taken, from the Sussex case
Itself to the accumulation of ships de
stroyed without warning slnco Ger
many gave assurances governing the
submarine campuign.
Kefore the next step is taken, the
collection of evidence Intended to
prove legally that the Sussex was de
stroyed by a (lerman submarine, wilt
have to proceed further. Additional
evidence in tho form of affidavits and
statements gathered by the American
embassy in I 'aria is arriving on the
steamer St. I'aul due In New York
tomorrow and will be In President
Wilson's bunds Monduy.
Will Discuss Situation.
The situation will be thoroughly
discussed at Tuesday's cublnet meet
ing and soon afterward a decision on
the next step Is expected.
The apparent difficulties of proving
the Sussex ease alone, leads many of
ficials close to tho president to be
lieve the decision will hinge on con
sideration of cumulative evidence that
Germany's promises are being disre
garded by her submarine comman
ders. Upon the strength of that evi
dence as it finally Is Judged by the
president and the cabinet will depend
what steps, if any. the United States
will take at this time.
The united Stutes was described of
ficially tonight ns being placed in the
position or a Judge in a court of law.
Upon the evidence a decision will be
reached nnd the United States will be
absolutely sure that it stands upon
firm ground beforo rendering one.
The finul decision will be rendered by
President Wilson. It Is likely thut If
drastic action Is called for congress
will be consulted.
To tjiic.siion 1'alth?
While It will be difficult for the
United States to question the good
fuith of Germany the administration
Is prepared to net upon circumstantial
evidence) of sufficient strength, should
it be obtained.
All the evidence thus far obtained
indicate!) that the Sussex was tor
pedoed. There are two weaknesses
In the case of the United States at
this time, however. One is thut no
American cltl.en saw the wake of a
torpedo before thu bow of the chan
nel steamer was torn off by an ex
plosion. Tho other is that whllo
American naval officers declare that
the pieces of metal received from the
hulk aro parts of a German torpedo,
there Is as fur as known no conclusive
evidence at this time that the metal
fragments actually were removed
from the Sussex. Every effort is be
ing made to secure evidence which
will establish beyond all doubt the
origin of the fngmcnts.
Cable Reports.
Official reports regarding the an
nouncement of tho German govern
ment as cabled to the United States
in prt-3 despatches from Berlin were
lacking tonight.
The orcss report was acepted as be
ing true.
The news despatches were laid be
fore President Wilson upon his return
from his trip down the Potomac.
Should the United States fall to
muke out a case on the Sussex, there
remains many other disasters to be
explained by the liirlln government
President Wilson and Secretury Lan
sing Jiave asked Ambassador Gerard
regarding other bhrs recently meet,
