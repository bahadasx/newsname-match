New Cavalry Columns W a Rushed South Yesterday While
Other Field Columns Toolt a New Direction Indicating
that the Troops are on a New Trail Line of Pursuit of
Villa is Now Four Hundred Miles Long and Refusal of Mex
icans to Permit Use of Mexican Railroads May Cause Ar
my Authorities to Establish Line from Ojinaga, by Way
of Chihuahua to Satevo, which Would be More than One
Hundred Miles Shorter than Present Line and Would De
crease Necessity of More Troops in Mexico Villa's Men
Said to have Reached Vicinity of Parral and He has Sent
Emissaries into Town to Ascertain Spirit of Garrison There
and Also to Get Provisions
San Antonio, Tex., April 8.
General Funston does not con
sider the expedition's purpose
accomplished although the
Amreicans have twice defeated
Villa's men and he does not
sider that the units of Villa's
command have been broken.
Reports of Villa's strength
south of Chihuahua were re
ceived here today.
The apparent hopelessness
of shipping over the Mexican
railroads from El Paso necessi
tates an alternative, army of
ficers believe that unless more
troops are sent to the present
line, which is more than three
hundred miles long, it could be
shortened to one hundred and
seventy milesb y the establish
ment of a line from Ojiniga, via
Chihuahua, to Satevo. They
suggest that four auto truck
companies start the new line
and then transfer the present
equipment to it. This plan
would decrease the necessity of
additional troops.
Troops on Villa's Trail
Field Headquarters (By aero
plane to Columbus,) April 8.
The American troops were on
a Fresh Villa trail on April 5,
according to an aviator who re
turned today from probably
one of the most important
scouting flights of the present
campaign in Mexico. New
cavalry columns hurried south
today, while other field col
umns took a new direction.
This caused Pershing to believe
that the troops are on a new
trail. The line of pursuit is
now four hundred miles long.
Villa Nearing Parral
El Paso, Texas., April 8. Villa
reached the environs of Parral and
has sent emissaries into the town to
test the spirit of the garrison there
and get provisions, according to in
formation from Mexican sources. The
report is credited here because Villa
was said to be fifty-five miles from
Parral two days ago.
Mexicans Refuse Permission.
Queretaro, April 8. The Mexican
government has not given the Ameri
can government permission to use the
Mexican railways for any purpose
whatever, said General Candido Agul-
lar,
Mexican minister of foreign rela-
tions
after a meeting of the Carranza
cabinet today.
At the cabinet meeting General Car
ranza ard his advisers discussed the
modifications suggested by the United
States in the recent proposals for an
agreement for crossing the frontier be
tween the United Slates and Mexico
by the armed forces of the respective
governments. The latest proposals of
the Washington state- department were
received here yesterday, having been
sent by Kliseo Arredondo, Mexican
minister designate to the United
St.ues.

IS NO BASIS FOR REPORT OF
RECALL OF AMERICANS.
ARE MOVING SOUTH
Orders Given to Funston, Following
Columbus Massacre, Are Unchanged
Says Secretary of War Forces
Have Chance of Success.
Washington, April 8. Secretary of
War Baker stated today most em
phatically that there was "absolutely
no basis of any kind" for the reports
that preparations are under way for
withdrawing the American forces
from Mexico. He said that the Ameri
can troops are moving rapidly south
and that orders to Funston following
the Columbus massacre are un
changed. Baker made the following
statement: "The object of the expedi
tion was stated when it was under
taken. It has never been changed.
No other orders have been issued,
and the expedition is busy pursuing
it now with what I hope is a fair
chance of early success."
Lansing Reiterates Statement.
'Washington, April 8. Ttie recur
rence of the reports that the Ameri
can troops were to be withdrawn
caused Secretary Lansing to reiter
ate that no withdrawal is content
teniplated. Officers of the war de
partment when questioned specifical
ly said that no immediate withdrawal
is contem plated.
Mexicans Want Troops Recalled.
El Paso, Tex., April 8. The Ameri

object of destroying Villa's military
power and should be withdrawn from
Mexico without delay according to
the unofficial expression of a mem
ber of the Carranza government to
day. Original Order to Funston.
Washington, D. C, April 3. The
original order given to General Fun
ston on March 10th for the punitive

did not include the direction or death
or capture of Villa, but directed the
dispersal of Villa's bandils that at
tacked Columbus. The order says
the work of the troops will be "re
garded as finished as soon as Villa's
band or bands are known to be brok
en up."

greatly increased and made more
varied.
A specially gotten up demonstra
tion of fine jewelry craftsmanship at
tracted notice, as Mr. Dorrah's repu
tation as one whose workmanship
is the best, is well known. Diamonds,
fine jewelry and silverware were in
evidence, and artistic ability was
shown in the display.
Kennedy, Spragins & Lewis.
Too much cannot be said of Ken
nerly, Spragins & Lewis' efforts to
attract the admiration of visitors. No
man in the city has worked as hard
as Mi. Lewis for the success of the
Style Show. With absolutely no sel
fish end in view, with nothing to ap
peal to "lovers of fashion," Mr
Invis gave practically five weeks of
his time to tho work, directing and
looking after many of the details. He
was the chairman of the finance com
mittee, and to his untiring efforts the
most successful effort to raise funds
was carried out. The store was and
is a blaze of electric lights, illumi
nating practically all or the block.
This from a man who depends
purely on contracts and the more
solid material work, is nothing short
df remarkable, and stands out as an
example to every man, no matter
what his calling is, of real public
spirit and patriotism.
Kirkbright's Letter Shop.
Another unostentatious and untir
ing worker for the success of the
show was Mr. Kirkbrlght of the Let
ter Shop. At the sacrifice of his own
time, so necessary to his own busi
ness, he assisted in the general ad
vertising campaign and deserves full
merit for the share he too't.
Bomar's Pharmacy.
Bomar's Pharmacy was "dressed
up" for the occasion and fully contrib
uted to the embellishment of the
block. Mr. Bomar has elegant dis
plays in his line, with tastily deco
rated windows in color schemes and
has no complaint to make as a result
of his efforts. "It's not business we
had in mind, so much as advertising
Ardmore," he suggestively remarked,
and that was the prevailing spirit.
Homer Boyd, the Fair Price Tailors
also contributed to the attractiveness
of the block. With such progress
lveness It is not difficult to foresee
a bigger and better establishment,
as Ardmore grows.

The German government

Sussex.
An economic conference of
the entente allies will be held
in Paris, April 20, to discuss

responsible for the explosion which
damaged the British steamer Sussex.
French Regain Lost Ground
London, April 8. The region north
west of Verdun around illaucourt and
between Ilethiucourt and Hill 2C5 is
still the scene of sanguinary encoun
ters between the French and the Ger
mans. Continuing their vigorous counter
attacks on tiie trenches taken from
them by t'he Germans between Beth
incourt and Hill 205, the French witli
tho use of hand grenades have recap
tured additional portions of their lost
ground, and in addition made progress
in communicating trenches.
Around Haucourt the Germans
launched a violent attack against the
French, previously having prepared the
way by a heavy bombardment last
ing several 'hours. The French, how
ever, through the use of their curtain
of fire and rapid fire guns, put down
the attack and forced the Germans to
retrtat, leaving numerous dead on the
ground as hey made their way back
to their trendies.
On the remainder of the front in
France and Belgium, artillery engage
ments have been in progress.
Ou the eastern front there has been
a continuation of the lively artillery
engagements in the lake region south
of Dviusk, especially about Lake,
Narooz where the Russians succeed
ed in occupying portions of German
trenches. The artillery on both sides
also has been busy around Riga anil
Friedrichstadt and in East Galicia.
