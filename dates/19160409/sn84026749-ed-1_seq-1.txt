U. S. Must Amend Plans to De

sex, Officials Say.
OTHER ATTACKS MATERIAL
Exceptions Taken to Reported
Distinction Drawn by Ger
many Between Ships.
Germany's flat denial of re
sponsibility for destruction of the
French channel liner Sussex with
the loss of fifty lives may cause
a delay in settlement of the sub
' marine issue, officials said today.
In the face of the report of the
German government' that it has
made a full investigation and
J, "found" none of its submarines
guilty of the attack, officials said
tho United States would feel it
, self compelled to act with ' the
greatest jdeliberation when left to
V'4p,juflge,'bw,ceathe allied govern
ments' charges and the. German
denials. "
MUST CHANGE PLAN,
Tho result ofthW situation. It waa
said, will be to compel the United 8tates '
to amend Its plan of deciding tho sub'
marine Issue with Germany almost
solely on tho Sussex case, and will make
It necessary for tho Administration to
take into consideration all tho recent
nuomarlno attacks.
Consideration will be given to the cu
mulative evidence afforded by alleged
submarine attacks on moro than a scoro
o vcssols since the new U-boat policy
went Into effect. The result may bring
further delay in Bottling the Issue.
rmany's denial of responsibility, It
Is pointed out, places the United States
In tho position of Judging, tho case on
evidence submitted by one side alone.
inasmuch ns the testimony of Ameri
cans aboard tho Sussex is not consid
ered conclusive.
Tho United 8tatcs will proceed with
caution. It was said, bofore setting It
self up ns Judge and throwing out Ger
many's dofenso without giving Ger
many a hearing.
Evidence Due Tomorrow.
The official text of tile Herlln govern
ment's denial had not roached tho State
Department today, but It waa expected
neuriy rrom Ambassador Gerard.
The complete evidence taken at the
British and French Investigations Is ex.
pected to reach the State Department
tomorrow, mis ewnenca may prove
conclusive, but this will not be known
until Secretary Lansing hns had time
'to go over the evidence In detail.
Officials took "exception to statements
made In press dispatches that Germany
denied responsibility for the attacks on
the Manchester Engineer. Englishman,
Eagle Point, and Berwlndale, In which
American lives were lost or Jeopardized,
