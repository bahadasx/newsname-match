Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Persistent attempts by the Germans
to reduce the salients in the French
lines northwest of Verdun are result
ing in steady progress for the opera
tion. Attacks are being driven home
on both sides of the salient, at the
northern angle of which the village of
Vtethincourt, but more particularly on
the western edge in the vicinity of
Haucourt.
Berlin reports the capture of two
strong points of support to the south
of Haucourt which passed recently in
to Gorman hands, an entire French po
sition along a front of more than a
mile and a quarter coming into Teu
tonic possession. Paris has admitted
German advanoys here, but declares
that on the opposite side of the salient
the advantage in the recent fighting
has been with the French. The pres
ent German activity in the Verdun re
gion is confined almost entirely to this
operation, although the artillery in oth
frr sections around the fortress is be
ing intermittent" employed.
On the eastern front there have been
no operations of major importance, so
far as the official reports show. The
Russians apparently are limiting their
activity at present for the most part
to the Lake Narocz region, south of
Dvinsk, and Berlin declares that such j
attacks as have. b&n made-there were
along a narrow front and were easily
remilsed.

BERLIN, April S (Via London).
The German government is able to an
nounce that no German submarine or
warship was responsible for the ex
plosion which damaged the British
steamship Sussex.
When Germany, on April ,r, handed
Ambassador Gerard an interim note re
plying to the inquiries of the United
States government regarding the Sus
sex and the four other steamers, the
matter of responsibility was still in
doubt and the investigation was still
proceeding. The German foreign of
fice, appreciating the agitation in the
United States over these cases, trans
mitted an interim response, declaring
the readiness uf the government,.
should the Sussex prove to have been
destroyed by a German torpedo con
trary to the understanding with the
United States, to make all reparation,
including the payment of compensa
tion. The Associated Press was authorita
tively informed today that the investi
gation has now been completed; that
all the craft which must possibly have
been involved in an attack on the Sus
sex have reported, and that from the
reports of their commanders it is ab
solutely certain that the Sussex was
not destroyed by a German torpedo,
and that Germany is in nowise respon
sible for the disaster.
From the material at hand it will
also be possible to reply to the Amer
ican inquiries regarding the steamer
Englishman, Manchester, Engineer,
Eagle Point and Berwindale, and es
tablish, according to the German con
tention, that no blame attaches to Germany.

Force Crisis in Submarine
Situation Despite Ger
many's Denial
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 8 Germany's
disclaimer of responsibility for the
disaster of the channel steamer Sus
sex surrounds the position of the
United States in the present subma
rine situation with further difficulties
and may turn action, if any be taken,
from the Sussex case itself to the ac
cumulation of ships destroyed with
out warning since Germany gave as
surance governing the submarine
campaign.
Before the next step is taken, the
collection of evidence intended to
prove legally that the Sussex was
destroyed by a German submarine,
will have to proceed further. Additional-
evidence in the form of affi
davits and statements gathered by the
American embassy in Paris is arriving
on the steamer St. Paul due in New
Yolk tomorrow and will be in Presi
dent Wilson's hands Monday.
The situation will be thoroughly
discussed at Tuesday's cabinet meet
ing and soon afterward a decision on
the next step is expected.
The apparent difficulties of prov
ing the Sussex case alone leads many
officials close to the president to be
lieve the decision will hinge on con
sideration of cumulative evidence that
Germany's promises are being disre
garded by her submarine commanders.
Upon the strength of that evidence
as it is finally judged by the presi
dent and the cabinet will depend what
steps, if any, the United States will
take at this time.
The United States was described
officially tonight as being placed in
the position of a judge of a court of
law. Upon the evidence a decision
will -be reached and the United States
will be absolutely sure that it stands
upon firm ground before rendering
one. The final decision will be ren
dered by President Wilson. It is like
ly that If drastic action is culled for,
congress, will be consulted.
' While .'it 'wllfW' difficult for the
United States to question the good
faith of Germany, the administration
is prepared to act upon circumstantial
evidence of sufficient strength should
it be secured.
t All the evidence thus far obtained
indicates that the Sussex was tor
pedoed. There are two weaknesses
in the case of the United States at
this time, however. One is that no
American citizen saw the wake of a
torpedo. The other is that, while
American paval officers declare that
the metals removed from the hulk
are parts of a German torpedo there
is,' as far as known, no conclusive
evidence at this time, that the metal
fragments actually were removed from
the Sussex.

WASHINGTON, April X. With the
filial vote on the army organization
bill assured in the senate on April is
there still is much speculation as to
the probable final form in which the
first of the great national prepared
ness measures will go to the joint con
ference committee of the senate and
the house.
The senate agreed today to devote to
the army bill all its sessions between
now and April IS, with the exception of
next Monday and Tuesday, which were
reserved for discussion of the free
sugar repeal bill. The agreement con
templates final disposition of the army
bill before adjournment April 18.
Some senators anticipate that a con
siderable increase will be rtiade by the
senate over the committee's proposal
to fix the peace strength of the stand
ing army at 1S0.O0U enlisted men. Both
republican and democratic members
have declared on the floor they would
support amendments for a greater fig
ure, some advocating as large a force
as 300,000. Senator Chamberlain,
chairman of the military conmiittee,
originaliy proposed a peace strength of
LL'O.OOO.
During the week of discussion on the
bill there has been nothing to indicate
the position of the majority of senators.
It lias been noticeable however that
there have been no proposals to reduce
the committee's figures. The bill
passed by the house provides for a
peace strength of 140.000 and the strug
gle to come in the conference commit
tee is expected to be sharply outlined.
There are indications that the recent
battle in the senate over the volunteer
army plan will have an important bear
ing in the conference committee. The
continen'al army project of the admin
istration was particularly repugnant to
the members' of the house military com
mittee. The senate's volunteer army
proposal, retained in the bill by a close
vote, is miniature reproduction of the
abandoned continental army scheme.
Debate in the senate today was con
fined to the government nitrate plants
projects. None of the pending amend
ments was voted on.

the proposal to provide in an army bill

so that "when the men are at the front
fighting an invader, the women and

"Of course, if you side against your
country and are untrue to the flag,'
said the letter, "you will oppose this
building.
"First we passed the Shietcrs dam

it was a preparedness bill. Then came

Gratification was expressed at Gen

Juarez. Failure to get this right,
however, and realizing the impossi

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO, April 8 The pursuit of
Villa has been brought to a definite
halt, according to a statement made
here tonight by an American army of
ficer holding a position of responsi
bility. "There is no use blinking at the facts"
he said. "Even a layman should be
able to understand that General Per
shing, with the relatively small num
ber of men under his command cannot
maintain lines of communication any
where from 300 to 500 miles long and
at the same time press the pursuit of a
bandit into a country where he in
known to have thousands of Sympa
thizers if not actual supporters.
"With the free use of the Mexican
railroads we could still hope to effect
something but apparently there is no
hope of such a concession, at least at
present. I cannot see that the army
can do anything more until the railroad
problem is settled in our favor or sub
stantial reinforcements are sent Gen
eral Pershing. I know -nothing about
reports that the withdrawal of tha
troops is contemplated. That is a ques
tion for Washington to decide. It is
hardly necessary for me to say that it
is a solution which would be a bitter
pill for us."
The border is in the state tonight of
a man holding his breath in anticipa
tion of some great and imminent events,
j Statements from Mexican officials
here and in Juarez, coupled with the
' dispatches from Washington, are ac
: cepted as intimations that a speedy and
i sensational development in the situa
tion is coming. In connection with this
: feeling, reports continue to come from
ja dozen different sources of the con

i border. These reports come in such a
manner that they cannot be ignored

For over a week it has been reported

j A statement from Mexican sources

against American troops, are de
, scribed here as some of the strongest
land toughest specimens of physical
'development which the Mexican wars
have produced. All reports agree that
there are not more than f00 of these
men and some reports indicated there
may be considerably less, especially
of this body guard type.
They are described as well seasoned
men in distinction from the boys and
lanky young men who composed the
bulk of Villa's army. They are sup
posed to be fairly good shots, al
though their rifles are said to be in
ferior. They have the reputation of
being able to travel without food such
as other men need. Sometimes a
good-sized handful of corn is passed
out to them as their entire day's ra
tions. While it is evident that there
has been a great falling off in loy
alty to Villa since his attack on Co
lumbus, it is thought possible that
this' handful of his old guards may
show the real fight in Villa's defense
if their leader stays with them until
the Americans overtake them.
j "One is reluctant to criticize the ad
ministration in its foreign policy at a
: 'ime of anxiety like the present day. I
i had rather present a united front to

j but had the Wilson administration
omitted its needless meddling in Mex
! ico which include the need! es en
couragement of both Carranza and
Villa, this pursuit would have been un
necessary, and opprobrioum and insult
and the sacrifice of many American
lives and much property in Mexico
probably would have been avoided.
"When we encourage American en
terprise and capital to go into for
eign lands, under treaty rights, every
American assurance ought to go with
them,"
