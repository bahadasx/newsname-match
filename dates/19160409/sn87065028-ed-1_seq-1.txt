Get your trash ready, for the

On tomorrow the members of the
Ladies Civic League will inaugurate
their annual clean-up campaign,
which will extend throughout the
week, and they want all citizens,
especially householders, to co oper
ate with them by having t'nei- trash
nnd other refuse matter collected
and ready for the wagoiyt when they
arrive for the purpose of taking it
to the municipal creamatory for
incineration. Mayor Gunter has
given the ladies permission to use as
many of the city wagona and carts
as can be spared and a number of
local merchants have also placH
teams at their disposal. These teams
wnl be sent through every portion
of the city and will remove all
trHh found qwait.ng them on their
different routes.
. The ladies have decided to enter
Columbus in the clean-city contest
now being conducted under the aus
pices of the Mississippi State Board
of Health, and hope to have that
body place its stamp of approval on
the city by at least giving it an
"honorable mention." In order to
accomplish effective work, how
ever, they must have the hearty co
operation and support of the citi
iens, especially among those who
own homes and those who are in
Illness. Qf co'jrs the lad'e. can
not personally see that every home,
eve-y store, every shop, every hotel,

made spic-and-span, and the duty of
placing these different establish

devolves ipon the owners If the e
individuals will show the proper

Local police are investigating the
robbery, but up to last night had

that the crime was committed by a
man thoroughly familiar not only
with th? (rmnwrncnt of the store

conducting his business.
