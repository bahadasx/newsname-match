fore him of "breaking up Villa's band
or bands" as accomplished-
The net result of iho three week's
campaign against Villa Is a killing of
a. few more than l",o of Villa's men
and the extension of a line of Amer
ican troops approximately 400 miles
Into Mexico. Villa's uragnization re
mains intact so far as army officers
here know. He has divided it Into
smaller units and one of these was
attacked and defeated ut Guerrero
but there is evidence that the fugitive
chieftain, although perhaps wounded
and possibly traveling on a stretc her,
Is yet directing in a general way their
movements.
Instead of .anticipating an early
withdrawal of the troops, General
Funston has planned to stimulate tho
chase in every way possible and in
order to do this has daily watched
for advices from Washington that
Carranza had nt last made it possible
to use without restraint at least one
of the railroads extending south- Fail
ure to jjet this right, however. anJ.
realization of tho impracticability of j
maintaining- the -100-mile line from
Columbus to the extreme front below I
Kutevo, caused General Funston and j
his staff to consider seriously the es- I
tablishnicnt of a new base at some
point on the border nearer the field
of operations, perhaps Ojinuga, and
trorn there the running south of a
line of communication. Unofficially
it was intimated that such a change
of base would bo suggested to th.i
war department unless permission
I to use the railways was granted.

ranch and gone southwards towards
Satcvo, south of which the greater
part of the Tenth cavalry ts opcrut-

(have hf-en moved forward along the
re-Jjine of commtinications and in the
event of an .engagement, reinforce
ments could be sent forward without
great loss of time.
From Columbus to Satevo, General
Pershing is known to have main
tained a compact military organiza
tion and the only regret at head
quarters has ben the inability to
supply his column adequately for tho
maintenu nee of so many men along
the roundabout route from Columbus.

it necessary lo pursue Villa to the end
of the earth or to keep up the hunt
Indefinitely after their object of
smashing Villa as a military power
has been accomplished."
