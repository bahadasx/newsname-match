GERMANS SLOWLY DRIVING

persistent Attacks Are {Ujported

OFFICIAL STATEMENTS
ARE VERY CONFLICTING

London, April 8.—Persistent at­
tempts by the Germans to reduce the
salients in the French lines north­
west of Verdun are resulting in steady
progress for the operations. Attacks
are being driven home on both sides
of the salient, at the northern angle
of which lies the village of Bethin
court, but more particularly on the
western edge in the vicinity of Hau*
court.
Berlin reports the capturc of two
strong points of support to the south
of Haucourt, which passed recently
into 'German hands, anil an entire
French position along a front of more
than a milo and a quarter, coming in­
to Teutonic possession. Paris has ad­
mitted German advances here, but de­
clares that on the opposite side of
the salient the advantage in the re­
cent fighting has been with the
French.
On the eastern front there have
been no operations of major import­
ance, gso s®
?ia}. ve^drt
shows.
Violent fighting is taking place on
the Anstro-Ttalian front, the Austrian*
being: on the aggressive in several
sectors, and reporting considerable
successes, with the capture of numer­
ous prjiscners.

Paris reports the sinking of an Aus­
trian transport in the Adriatic by a
French submarine. A fierlin dispatch
state- that the German government is
able to announce that uo German sub­
marine was responsible for the ex­
plosion which damaged the cross
channel steamer, Sussex.
Disclaims Submarining Sussex.
Germany's disclaimer of the respon­
sibility for the destruction of the
channel steamer, Sussex, surrounds
the submarine situation with further
difficulties and may turn action, if any
be taken from the Sussex case itself,
to the accumulation of ships destroy­
ed without warning since Germany
gave assurances governing the sub­
marine campaign.
Gather More Evidence.
Before the next step is taken, the
collection of evidence intended to
prove legally that the Sussex was de­
stroyed by a German submarine will
have to proceed further. Additional
evidence in the form of affidavits and
statements gathered by the American
embassy in Paris is arriving on the
steamer, St. Paul, due in New York
tomorrow, and will be in President
Wilson's hands Monday.
Discussion Expected Soon.
The situation will be discussed at
Tuesday's cabinet meeting and then
decision is expected.
The apparent difficulties of proving
the Sussex case alone leaves many
officials close to the President to be­
lieve the situation will hinge on ac­
cumulative evidences that Germany's
promises are being disregarded by
her commanders. Upon the strength
of that evidence, as it is finally judged
by the president and cabinet, will de­
pend what' steps, if any, the United
States will take at this time.
Uncle Sam, Judge.
The United States was described
officially tonight as being placed in
the position of a judge of a court of
law. Upon the evidence a decision
will be reached and the United States
will be absolutely sure that it stands
upon firm ground beyond rendering
the decision. The final decision will
'be fendered by President Wilson. Jt
is likely, if drastic action is called for,
congress will be consulted.
While it will be difficult for the
United States to question the good
faith of Germany, the administration
is prepared to act upon circumstan­
tial evidence of sufficient strength,
should it be secured. All the evidence
thus far indicates that the Sussex was
torpedoed. There are two weakness­
es in the case of the United States,
however. One is that no American
citizen saw the wake of the torpedo.
The other is that there is, as far as
known, no conclusive evidence at this
time that the metal fragments, said
to be a part of a German torpedo,
.actually were removed from the Sus-

Crest of Flood Expected to Ar­

day.
iLaCrosse, April 8—With the stage
of water above 32 feet, the crest of
the Mississippi river flood is expect­
ed to be reached here Sunday. The
stream came up only two inches to­
day. Team travel between LaCrosse
and French island and Onalaska is
shut off by washed out roads. Far­
mers on iGoose Island are marooned
in houses by water. The Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy work trains are
still pouring tons of rock and gravel
out on the railroad's right of way
south of here to stop washing away
of the banks, where the flood is cut­
ting in. Stocks of merchandise in
basements of wholesale houses along
the river have been damaged by wa­
ter entering cellars.

SEN. KENYON SCORES
PORK BARREL PLANS
Washington, April 8—Legislators
who seek to cloak all sorts of pro­
posals under a plea of preparedness
were denounced in the senate today
by Senator Kenyon. In a speech op­
posing a proposal to provide in the
army bill for a government owned
fertilizer plant, the Iowa senator read
a letter from a former constituent,
urging support for a postoffice build­
ing "round like a fort," and with or­
namental turrets and peaks for look­
outs so that "when the men are at
the front fighting an invader, the
women and children can take refuge
in the postoffice."
Traitor If Honest
"Of course if you side against your
country and are untrue to the flag,"
said the letter, "you will oppose this
building."
"First we passed the Shields dam
bill," said Senator Kenyon, "because
it was a preparedness bill. Then
came along another dam bill, which
we were urged to pass as a part of.
the national defense. The child la­
bor bill and the rural credits bill
certainly are included as means of
securing us against foes, and I sup­
pose when the rivers and harbors ap­
propriation bill comes along every
supporter of sand bottom and mud
creek will insist that the safety of
the nation requires an appropriation
for his particular county seat."
United States Marshal Goes on a
1200 Mile Trip to Secure

iSeward, Alaska, April 8—A drunk­
en brawl in which an Indian killed
a white man, started U. S. District
Attorney, William Spence, from here
today on a 1200 mile trip by boat
to Unga, near the western tip of the
Aleutian Islands. He went to see
whether Simon Verskin, the Indian,
should he brought here for trial,
with the necessary 'Witnesses at large
expense to the government. Ver­
skin claims he shot in self defense.
Administration of justice in western
Alaska comes high, because of the
great distance involved in transport­
ing witnesses.

All the Rest of the Time Will

FINAL VOTE ON
MEASURE APRIL 18
Senator J. Ham Objects to Waste
of Legislative Time on
Preparedness,
Washington, April 8.—With the
final vote on the army organization
bill assured in the senate on April 18,
there still is much speculation as to
the probable final form in which the
first of the great national prepared­
ness measures will go to the joint con­
ference committee of both houses.
Sugar Repeal Bill.
The senate agreed today to devote
to the arnjy bill all its sessions be­
tween now and April 18, with the ex­
ception of next Monday and Tuesday,
which were reserved for discussion of
the free sugar repeal bill. The agree­
ment contemplates final disposition of
the army bill before April 18.
300,000 Standing Army.
Some senators anticipated that a
considerable increase will be made by
the senate over the senate's proposal
to fix the peace strength of the stand­
ing army at 0,000 enlisted men.
Both republican and democratic mem­
bers have declared on the floor they
would support amendments for a
greater figure, some advocating as
large a force as 300,000. Senator
Chamberlain, chairman of the military
committee, originally proposed a
peace strength of 220,000 men.
There are indications that the re
cent battle in the senate over the vol­
unteer army plan will have an import
ant bearing on the committee.
The debate in the senate today was
confined to the government nitrate
project.
J. HAM LEWIS ON TIME.
Senator Lewis took the senate to
task Xor the gine it was devoting lb
consideration of the bill.
"The senate," he said, "manifests
a disposition in avoid-responsibility.
We should either round the country
with force or we should announce to
the country that force is not needed
and direct our attention to the dis
cussion of legislation for the advance
ment of the nation's civil life."
Declaring the diplomatic situation
was precarious and that' the Mexican
problem "multiplied embarrassments"
Senator Lewis added: "We cannot ut­
ter a doctrine and ignore its execu
tion."

THIRTY-SIXTH TEAR, NO. 86 (NEW8 Or THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 9, 1916. (BY ASSOCIATED PR74SS)
New York Republican Chairman
Goes on Record as Opposing
Jtalsevclt.
WANTS MAN|oF
TRIED REPUBLICANISM
Mr. Tanner Would Not Make
His Choice Between Root
and Justice.
New York, April 8— Responding to
pleas that a crisis confronts ~oih the
republican party and the country and
that the national, situation ought to
take precedence over factional dis­
putes, the newly elected state com­
mittee here todsty elected Frederick
T. Tanner of this city, chairman.
The result was) regarded by the
chairman's friends' as adding strength
to the movement favoring Supreme
Justice Charles E Hughes for the
presidency, and toward a rehomina
tion for Governor Charles SU Whit­
man.
Mr. Tanner's supporters placed this
interpretation on his re-election be­
cause of the fact that State Senator
Charles W. Wicks, of Utica, his de­
feated rival, was put forward by Wil­
liam Barnes of Albany, United States
Senator James W. Wadsworth, fatate
Senator Elon R. Brown and others,
who favored the nomination of Elihu
Root at the Chicago convention. The
Tanner faction supported the Hughes
movement.
The ote polled today was S2 l'or
Mr. Tanner.to 63 for .Mr. Wicks.
No Candidate Mentioned.
No candidate for president was
mentioned either hi"speakers or reso­
lutions adopted after Mr. Tanner's
re-election. This memorial urged the
nomination of "a tried republican in
whose record and character- the na­
tion can rely as a.guarantee for wise
statesmanship in management of for­
eign and domestic fftairs

Take the Tip
Listen to what Herman
Rosefield, advertising man­
ager. of Sears, Roebuck &
Co., recently told the mem­
bers of the American Ad
Club at a convention. "We
have a bureau whose duty
it is to read, each weeK,
the country newspapers
from all over the country.
There is not a paper of
any consequence in our
trade territory that' our bu­
reau does not get. This
bureau looks over these
papers and when we find
a town where the merch­
ants are not advertising in
the local paper we immed­
iately flood that territory
with our literature. It al­
ways brings results far in
excess of the same effort
put forth in territory
where the local merchants
all the time use their local
paper." Could we find a
stronger argument as to
the need of advertising by
the local merchant?
The power of advertis­
ing cannot be measured.
It is tremendous and suc­
cessful men everywhere
are giving it more atten­
tion than ever.
PUNITIVE EXPEDITION INTO MEXICO RECALLS WAR OF 1847

work, and who was here today, declar­
ed the outlook for northern Red river
valley is brighter, so far as flood dan­

Mr. Chandler investigated water

estimated tonight that Red river
would reach its crest at Grand Forks
probably on Tuesday, when it would
rise to a point within 15 feet of the
level of the streets in the main dis­

Fair Chance of Accomplishing
Purpose for Which Pnaitiv#
Expedition Started
NO ORDER TO KILL
OR CAPTURE BANDIT*
Is Made Known to Public by U»r
jor General Scott and War
Department,
Washington, April S—Secretary Ba»
ker Informally denying today that
immediate withdrawing from .Mexico
of the Expeditionary force was con*
templated, said that the War depart*
ment had information that the troop*
ers were close on the trail of Villa
and the expedition might soon accom*
plish the purpose for which it was
sent over the border.
Object to Disperse Bandits
"The object of the expedition was
stated when it was, undertaken," :s«hl
.Secretary Baker. "It has never beete
changed. Xo other orders have been
given and the expedition is busily
pursuing it now with what I hop^
is a fair chance of early success."
"No Basis of Any Kind"
Reports that preparations for with*
drawal were under way were de*
clared by Mr. Baker to have "abso*
original army order to cross the bor­
der a month ago reveals that ndl
specified direction to capture or Wll
Villa was included. The order made
public by Major General Scott, chief
of staff, stated that the Work of the
U. S. troops "would be regarded fin­
ished as soon as Villa's band or bands
are known to be broken up," and
that the Americans would withdraw1
"as soon as the de facto government
of Mexico is able to relieve them0 of
this work."
Order Still Unchanged
Secretary Baker and General Scott
said the order was unchanged that
no new or supplemental order had
been given and that General Funston
had not yet reported that the Ameri­
can expedition's object h£d been at*
tained. It was recalled that on the
day the troops crossed, Secretary Ba*
ker said their object was "to capture
or disperse" the bandits who raided
Columbus.
Lansing Issues Statement
Secretary Lansing also issued a
statement today stating he knew of
no intention to withdraw the troops.
It was stated officially today that
General Funston's orders were broad
enough to include dealing personal­
ly with Villa if he should 'be encount­
ered, Satisfaction with the trans-J
portation situation was indicated to­
day at the state department.
Pursuit Halted
The pursuit of Villa has been
brought to a halt, according to a
statement made here tonight by an
American army officer.
"There is no use blinking at the
facts," said. "Even a layman should
be able to understand that General
Pershing with the relatively small
number of men under his command
cannot maintain lines of communica­
tion anywhere from 300 to 500 miles
long, and at the same time press the
pursuit of a bandit into a country
where he is known to have thousands
of sympathizers if not active support*
ers."
"Withdrawal Bitter Pill"
"With the free use of the Mexican
railroads, we still could hope to ef­
fect something, but there la no hope
of such a concession, at Malt at
present. I know fiothlltf afcOUt re­
ports of withdrawing troops la con­
templated. That is a question for
Washington to decide. It is hardly
necessary for me to say that it
solution that would be a bitter pill
for us."
Sensational Developments teen
Statements of officials here and in
Juarez, coupled with Washington dis­
patches are accepted that a speedy
and sensational development i» the
situation is coming. In connection
with this feeling, reports continne to
come from a dosen different soaveea
from the concentration of Carraasai
troops near the border. These re­
ports come in such a manner that
thejy cannot be ignored aap
known that they have been'forward*
ed to Washington as credible.
