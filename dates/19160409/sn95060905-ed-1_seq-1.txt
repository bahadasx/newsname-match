TO
SAY VILLA'S CAPTURE ONLY
MATTER OF A FEW HOURS
i
Private Advices to San Antonio and to Mexican Consul
I Bring News; Villa Believed Cornered Near
Parral; Americans Near Boca Grande
L ORDER DID NOT SAY
SAN ANTONIO. April 9. Private advices to head
quarters and reports to the local Mexican consul state that
Villa's capture or death is a matter of a few hours. The
general impression here is that important news is awaited
at headquarters and an air of expectancy prevails. The
l i.i: i.i. ir:n :- i th. :i.: i.:
tulsu uuiievea Liuit v ttiu
from Washington that the
wnen ine v niisia oanas are acauerea, is noc creauea nere.
The reinforcements recently ordered into Mexico and the
plans for further troop movement indicate a powerful
effort on the part of the entire American army to kill or
capture Villa. Headquarters are convinced that Villa is
near Parral. Two American columns are reported, on
forced marches after hin and strong Carranza forces, are
after Villa just south of Parral.
WASHINGTON, April 9. -The official order which
was given Gen. Funsten M.uvh luth has been published.
It does not say "get Villa" but says that the United
States will regard the mission of the expedition as com
pleted as far as the defacto government is able to relieve
the expedition from the task of breaking up the Villa
band. When asked to explain the variance between the
published order and the first announcement of the expedi
tion to "get Villa" a high army official said "I can't say
anything in regard to that. There are the orders.
However, the public should not intrepret it to mean that
we are about to withdraw from Mexico.'' The publica
tion of this order, however, when border reports say Car
ranza might request the withdrawal of the American
army, is intrepreted to mean that the administration is
preparing to agree thereby. It is plainly discernible ten
dency of the order that they could withdraw before the
capture of Villa.
COLUMBUS, April 9.

fsive defensive works are being built around the temporary
base. Lieut Col. Tyree Rivers of the 13th Cavalry is re
