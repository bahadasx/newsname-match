Tied Up Traffic Effectively.
It was conceded by oil concerned that
the strike of the two branches of the
! Washington and Old Dominion line
( probably tied up traffic about as effectively
as any strike that has ever occurred
in this country. Not one piece
of rolling stock was able to go over
the road yesterday after ahout 2 o'clock, j
: when a second train from Bluemont j
reached Rosslyn, and it was wnile a ;
member of the office force was moving I
part of that train that one of the cars
blocked the tracks near the car barn.
Shortly after a spring switch at the
west end of the railway yard was
reached the forward truck crossed to
the inbound track, while the rear truck
remained on the outbound track, and. it ;
is stated, the car came near crashing j
into a car containing a dozen or more
so-called strikebreakers.
The train of four cars that reached
Rosslyn shortly after 2 o'clock, it was
said. left Bluemont shortly after 10 in
the morning, it was composed of one
! car partly filled with passengers, an
v v,..^oo <.ai mai weirs ueaunpa(ie(J, a
milk car and a freight car. The milk
car contained about 2.500 gallons of
milk consigned to Washington dealers.
It is said that tTfat section of Virginia
supplies about 2,SCO gallons of milk to
the city. 300 gallons of which were
brought here on trucks and in wagons
earlier in the day. Trainmen experienced
a delay near Vienna, where, it
is stated, there is an overhead bridge.
.Some unidentified person or persons
had dropped a chain with hook attachment
from the bridge across the overhead
wires. Owing to a miscalculation
in dropping the chain, however, it is
stated, not much damage was done
when the train reached the bridge.
Reward of $500.
A reward of $500 has been offered for
information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the persons responsible
for derailing two cars on the Washington-Virginia
line at Nauck station P'riday
night. . It is stated that the tracks
were soaped for a distance of fully onequarter
of a mile, and that a car taking
the track at a speed of twenty miles at
the north end of the soaping might easily
have attained a speed of seventy
miles at the other end.
Cars on the lines in operation last
night were well-patronized. Strikers
and many sympathizers, however, patronized
the temporary bus lines that
were established between the north
end of Aqueduct bridge or Rosslyn
and nearby points in Virginia. Residents
of the section between Bluemont
and Great P'alls and this city were
greatly inconvenienced by the strike,
and a number of persons residing in
the vicinity of Bluemont. Hamilton.

terminus of the road reached thenhomes

which lies the village of Bethincourt.
but more particularly on
the western edge in the vicinity
of Haucourt.
Berlin reports the capture of
strong points of support to the
south of Haucourt, which passed
recently into German hands, an
entire French position along a
front of more than a mile and a
quarter coming into Teutonic
possession. Paris has admitted
German advances here, but declares
that on the opposite side
of the salient the advantage in
the recent fighting has been with
the French. The present German
activity in the Verdun region is
confined almost entirely to this
operation, although the artillery
in other sectors around the fortress
is being intermittently employed.
French Told to Fight Hard.
According to a dispatch from Berlin
informatioi has been obtained from French
prisoners and orders found on them
which indicate, according to German correspondents
in the Verdun region, that
the French are fully aware of the importance
of every yard of territory "iri
their salient, whose northeasternmost
point is Bethincourt, now the only village
of this section of the battle front
remaining in their hands. French troops
have been ordered by Gen. Joffre to hold
every inch of ground with all the 'force
at tiifcir command, the correspondents
aver, and every German gain is registered
. only in the face of desperate resistance.
The character of the* terrain is well
suited to defensive purposes. The assailing
forces are obliged to storm over
open rklges which are flunked by forests
in which large numbers of skilfully builtin
and concealed machine guns are located.

Those troops who are still desperate iy

WOMAN'S QUICK WIT
HALTS SMUGGLING
OF FOUR CHINAMEN
ALBANY, N. Y? April 8.?
Quick wit of a woman ticket
seller on a toll bridge aided federal
officials today in blocking
an alleged plot to smuggle four
Chinese into the country.
Because of advices that a
party of Chinese were being
taken secretly from the Canadian
border to New York city,
[ Chinese Inspector Albert B.
Wiley and Deputy Revenue Collector
William Scott were
scrutinizing closely every auto>
mobile that passed dow n Broadway
today. A touring car
aroused their suspicions and
they followed it in another
i automobile. As the machines
turned onto the (ireenbush
bridge, spanning the Hudson
river. Inspector Wiley ordered
the chauffeur of the suspicious
I car to stop. The car was halted,
j but the driver would not shut
I Off his engine. Mrs. William
> Chambers, ticket agent of the
toll bridge, seeing from the
window of her office that someI
thing was wrong, signaled to
the draw tender and the bridge
was opened, halting the car.
j The four Chinese, with their
queues cut off and their faces
stained to give them the appearance
of mulattoes, were
found under a pile of gunny
j sacks in the rear of the car. In
| default of $10,000 bail they were
1 sent to jail.

Unprecedented Jump of Coast
Tribunal in Railroad Oil Land
Fight for Millions.
The United States circuit court At Uos
Angeles, Cal., has lifted itself by the
boot heels and will hold sessions here
in Washington for a few days, perhaps
several weeks. Judge Benjamin F.
Bledsoe, his clerk of the court, Charles
X. Williams, and the judge's secretary,
Lvle W. Rucker, have arrived in Washington
and are ready for the proceedings
to start.
This transcontinental jump, unprecedented,
it is said, was not made because
j the court preferred the April slush of
! Washington to the smiling skies of
| lower California, but was made sonte
what after the reason that Mahomet
i went to the mountain, the mountain
| having found it difficult to go to Mai
hornet. In other words. Judge Bledsoe
| found it easier to move the entire court
j to Washington than to have Washing
ton witnesses go to i-os Angeles to
j test ify.
Scores of Defendants.
The case in .Tudge Bledsoe's court Is
the enormous suit of the United States
against the Southern Pacific Railway
I Company, involving oil lands ranging
j in estimated value from a quarter
I of a billion to a billion dollars.
"I Representing the United States in the
! ease are District Attorney Albert
! Sohoonove" and Assistant Attorney
Ceneral F.. .1. Justice; the two attorneys
i representing the Southern Pacific are
1 Charles R. hewers and Henly C. Booth,
j They will be at the taking of testimony
j here in Washington and will represent
j broadly all the other defendants, of
i which there are scores, comprising oil
operators and others who are now occupying
the land in question.
! The question which is to he decided
j by Judge Bledsoe arises out of the origi
inal land grants to the Southern Pai
rifle. The statute which authorized !
! the grant of lands to that railroad was
. j enacted in 186(1. but the land now at is.
sue was turned over to tho 1
i is05. This land has proved to be rich
: | iti oil?among the richest 011 earth. The J
statute provided that the railroads :
should not be given mineral lands.
Government's Contention.
It is the contention ot the government
that the railroad scoiuted about on
the land now at issue a ltd determined
that it was fine oil-bearing property
and then got it front the government
under the guise of agricultural lands.
It is composed of the odd-numbered
sections in a strip approximately 100
miles long by eighteen miles wide.
The properly was transferred to the
railway while Senator Hoke Smith was
Secretary of the Interior, and it is undet
stood he will he asked to testify,
other government officials are on the
list of witnesses. The government will
ask that the lands he turned back to
the I'nited States and that an accounting
be made for all oil withdrawn.

DENIES THERE IS BASIS
FOR WITHDRAWAL RUMOR
Says Orders Given When the Expedi-1
tion Crossed the Border Have j
Never Been Changed.
Secretary Baker, in formally
denying yesterday that immediate
withdrawal from Mexico of *
the American expeditionary force
was contemplated, indicated that i
the War Department had information
that the United States !
troopers were close upon Villa's
trail, and that the expedition :
might soon accomplish the purpose
for which it was sent across
the border.
"The object of the expedition
was staged when it was under>
. . D_| ,.it
taken, saia secretary mm;i. u
has never been changed. No
other orders have been given, and
jthe expedition is busily pursuing
it now with what, I hope, is a fair
chance of early success."
No Prospect of Withdrawal.
Reports that preparations for withdrawal
were under way were declared
by Mr. Baker to have "absolutely no
I basis of any kind.'* All the War Department's
plans for pursuing the
chase were going forward actively, he
(declared, an order being placed only I
'yesterday for fifteen gasoline-carrying
motor trucks for Gen. Pershing's campaign.
The American forces were '
"pushing ahead," he said, but he had no 1
details of the operations.
Publication yesterday of the text of
the original army order to cross the J
border a month ago revealed that no '
specific direction to capture or kill f
Villa was included. The order, made (
public by Maj. Gen. Scott, chief of 1
staff, stated that the work of the ("nit- 1
ed States troops would "be regarded |5
finished as soon as Villa's band or |
bands are known to be broken up." and j '
that the Americans would withdraw j
"as soon as the de facto government of
Mexico is able to relieve them of this
work." 1
Say Order Still Holds.
Secretary Baker and Gen. Scott said ,
the order was unchanged, that no new ,
or supplemental order had been given j
and that Gen. Funston had not yet reported
that the American expedition's ,
object had been attained. It was re- ,
called that on the day the troops "
crossed Secretary Baker said their oh- j
ject was to "capture or disperse" the ]
bandits who raided Columbus. j '
Secretary Lansmn aiso a j
statement yesterday, saving he knew of
no intention to withdraw the troops.
He said also that no intimation had
come from the t'ananza government
that de facto government officials
thought Gen. Pershing had accomplished
his mission and should return
to ITnited States territory.
It was stated officially yesterday that
Gen. Funston's orders were broad
enough to include dealing personally
with Villa in case he should be encountered.
Satisfaction with the transportation
situation was indicated at the War and
State departments yesterday. "With
private shippers getting supplies
through on the Mexican railways, ultimately
available to the American
troops. Secretary Lansing believes the
railway situation has ceased to be a
factor. |
Carranza Limits Paper Issues. c
Gen. Carranza has decreed that in the f
reorganization of Mexico's finances the a
issue of paper money shall be limited y
to 500,000,000 pesos, with an equivalent t
of $250,000,000 American gold, which j \
will provide a currency circulation of. r
about $17 gold per capita. On the basis t
of dispatches from Mexico City, the,
Carranza embassy here yesterday is- j c
sued this statement: j s
"Such a limitation as this is made he- !b
cause the constitutionalist government
is convinced that the sum of 500,000,000
pesos is ample to meet every commercial e
need of the country, and also In order Q
that liabilities of the people of Mexico a
may be clearly known and defined. The .
limitation also simplifies the steps necessary
to be taken in providing and pro- a
tecting the metallic reserve of the de- t
part men t of hacienda < treasury). ^
"The total amount of paper currency
issued by the various authorizations of 8
First Chief Carranza. in combination a
with the issue from time to time made p
by different military chiefs to meet the ?
emergencies of the campaigns, do not
aggregate more than 700,000.000 pesos. a
These issues will be reduced to 500,000.- r<
000 pesos, and all these old issues re- q
tired by January 1. 1017. The new non
counierreuame mm* win n*- pin m oir- s
eolation 011 or before May 1, 19!6. and c
thereafter the retirement of the old issues
will proceed as rapidly as pos- t
sible." p
Secretary Baker, who was at the War v
Department until late Vast night, seein- r
cd even more optimistic after reading C
the evening's dispatches from the bor- t
der. He gave out none of the in forma- ii
tion transmitted by Gen. Funston, but r
indicated strongly that his hope for n
an early capture of Villa had been in- v
creased by the dispatches. d

Army Officers Gratified at the
Denial of Recall
Report.

Through Chihuahua.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex.. April 8.
?Gen. Funston does not regard
[lie task set him of breaking up
"Villa's band or bands'' as accomplished.
This was made clear at Fort
Sam Houston today when reports
were received that an unofficial
suggestion had been made that
American troops be withdrawn
from Mexico. One phase of the
situation which army officers refuse
to discuss, however, is a pro
hing is Known to iibvp mainiaineo ?
onipact military organization.
Officers at (Sen. Funston's headquarers
were interested toda> in a re
ort from Torreon that a conference
iras to be held tomorrow that might,
esult in the surrender Monday of Gen
'anuto Reyes, who has been leading
he most formidable band of Villa men
\ the vicinity of Torreon. Some apirehension
has been felt that Villa
night yet succeed in joining forces
rlth Reyes, thus making much more
lifflcult his capture.
A
vision in the War Department orders
to Gen. Funston which provides
for the removal of the
troops whenever the forces of
the de facto Mexican government
'are able to relieve them of this
work."
Pleased at Secretary's Denial.
Gratification was manifested at Gett.
Funston's headquarters when it w ma
learned that Secretary Lansing and Secretary
Baker had denied the government
was contemplating the withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico.
The net result of the week's campaign
against Villa, it was pointed out, has
been the killing of a few more than 150
of his men and the extension of a line
of American troops approximately 400
miles into Mexico.
Villa's organization remains intact, so
Tar as army officers here know. He has
divided it into smaller units and one of
these was attacked and defeated at
juerrero, but there is evidence that the
fugitive chieftain, although perhaps
wounded and possibly traveling on a
stretcher, as stated in some reports, is
?ei directing in a genera! way their
movements.
Gen. Pershing Optimistic.
Gen. Pershing's reports, infrequent to
teadquarters, continued throughout the
week to indicate the optimism of himself
ind his officers that they soon would
jvertake Villa or his main force, but
none of his reports has indicated that
ie regarded his task as accomplished.
Instead of anticipating an early
withdrawal of the troops. Gen. Fun?ton
ha& planned to stimulate the chase
n every way possible, and. in order to
io this, has dail\ watched lor advices
[from Washington that Gen. Carranza
had made it possible to use without
subterfuge at least one of the railroads
extending south from Juarez. Failure
:o get this right, however, and realizaioi.
r?f th? ii.mrMcticahilitv of main
aining the 400-mile line from Coluntaus
to the extreme front below Satevo
caused Gen. Funston and his staff to
onsider seriously the establishment of
l new base at some point on the borler
nearer the field of operations, perlaps
Ojinga, and from there the e?ablishrnent
of a new line of commulication
to tiie south. rnotficially it
vas intimated that such a change of
tase would be suggested to the War
department unless permission for the
jse of the railroads was received soon.
Little of what was transpiring south
>f Chihuahua was known at Gen. Fun-?
iton's headquarters today, but 110 uneasiness
was displayed and increased
:onfidence was manifested.
Believe Villa Will Be Overtaken.
This confidence w as not due* altogether
to the belief that the Amerians
would be able to overtake Villa,
>ut to the co-operation of Carranz&'s
orees. who were reported officially by
,gents of the Mexican government to
lave occupied strategic positions In
he path Villa was reported to be folowing.
If the thousands of men Caranza
claimed to have scattered
hrough the territory In front of Villa
an check him in his flight to the
outh. it was believed here he might
e brought to a stand.
Gen. Pershing was officially reportd
to have left his temporary headuarters
011 the San Geronimo ranch
nd gone south toward Satevo. where
he greater part of the 10th t'avlry
is operating. Col. W. 1' Brown, at
he head of those troops, was known t??
e searching every trail and invest 1ating
each story as to ihe wherebouts
of Villa or his followers. Suporting
forces have been moved forward
along the line of communications
nd in the event of serious engagement
enforcements could be sent forward
uickly.
