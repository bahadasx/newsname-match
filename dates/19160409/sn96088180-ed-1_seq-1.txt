asked that $10,000,000 be expend

of War Baker this afternoon, discuss

"I hope to have gdod Information

This was the first official utterance
Indicating an expectation of capturing
Villa shortly.
San Antonio, April 8. Private ad

consuls' reports today- stated that
Francisco Villa's capture or slaying
was, a matter of only a few hours.
The Impression gained at headquar
ters was that Important news was
awaited. An air of expectancy pre
vailed. The Carranzlsta consul here
believed Villa was cornered, al
though he admitted he had no de
tails. Washington dispatches Intim

said a committeeman, "that men fly
under officers who can not themselves
fly, and who frequently order flights

are unsafe."
"That is literally true," replied
Baker. "But Lieutenant Milling in

were due to the aviator and not to
any defect In the machine. Milling
said he bad seen 25 deaths of avia

a fault In the aeroplane. Our diffi
culties in Mexico are due to our in
ability to fly over mountains because
of weak motors. We have developed
now a compressed oxygen equipment,
giving our aircraft a wider range.
Army observers In Europe have been
unable to obtain satisfactory reports
of aeroplane developments there."
IN MEXICO till

though It Is necessary for Americans
to chase Villa to the end of Mexico.
His trail Is clear, although he ap

heading for Torreon, as reported,
General Trevlno will confront hlra
there. .. Eventually the Iron ring of
American troops Is expected to over
take and annihilate him.

violated instructions, it was uncondi
tionally stated here today.

sured President Wilson would be

On the other hand, vessels involv
ed in the four other recent submar-
ing cases concerning which President
Wilson made inquiry, were freighters.
Germany has never pledged itself
to warn freighters before torpedo
ing them. While they continue to
supply the allies with munitions of
war and food, and the allies continue
their starvation policy, Germany will
never yield its right to destroy
freighters, the United Press was re
liably Informed.
Washington, April 8. Administra
tion 'members said today they never
doubted Germany's assurances with
regard to submarine attacks Included
freight-carrying vessels.
A United Press dispatch from Ber
lin today said that German officials
claimed their assurances did not in
elude freighters and that they never
promised not to attack such ships
without warning. With regard to
the German claim that the command
er of the submarine which attacked
tha Sussex violated Instructions, the
authorities here said that such a
plea would not excuse Germany.
. The claiming of exemption from
blame because the Englishman, Man
chester Engineer and other vessels
mentioned in the American inquiry
were freighters Injects a new Issue
into the submarine controversy.

The Black Eagle group of mining
claims on Fiddler's gulch, a tribo.
tary to Josephine creek, has been
purchased by a company of men from
the state of Washington who will im
mediately develop the property. Th
purchase price Is $175,000. and tho
initial payment of f 80,000 was mad
yesterday when the mines were turn
ed over to their new owners. .
This property has been known lo
cally as the Neil mine, W. s. Neu
having been the head ot the com
pany that has held it. Associated,
with him were Dr. Dixon, Wm. Bun-
cannon and H. A. Neil. The pur
chasers are a company composed of
P. H. Walters, a mining man of
Seattle; Parvin Wright, . of tna
Wright Elevator company; Fred
Firth, ot Seattle; W. G. SwalweU,
manager of the Everett Paper mill at
Everett. Wash and Captain 'Smith,
owner of the old convict ship "Sac

working interest in the mine,' but
no stock Is being offered for sale.
Mr. Walters, who has been a min
ing man in the Spokane and British.

past, and has been here represent

coming away filled with enthusiasm
and confident that the mine would
goon be numbered with the great
producers of the coast. A recent dis

declared by Mr. Walters to be of al
most fabulous value. He tells ot a
piece of ground where he has taken
from 500 to 600 handsful of dirt
that gave from fl to fl.SO In gold
from each handful. The mine, how
ever, Is a quarts proposition, and a
concentrator of 50 tons dally capa

This mill, ot the Marks type, has al
ready been ordered, and It is expect
ed that It can be In operation before
June 1. Men will be put at work at
once getting the wagon road to the
mine tor the hauling of the heavy "
machinery as soon as It arrives. Mr, '
Wright will also superintend the con
struction of an electric plant for the
supplying of light and power, the
electricity to be generated by water
power. Messrs. Walters, Wright and
Firth will be actively engaged In the
development of the mine. . v ,
Mr. Nell and his associates have
held the property tor the past nine
years, and have done a great deal of
development work, opening nj the
body ot ore and showing It to be of
value and extent. They have built
trails and roads, and It Is ready to
ber-ome an immediate producer. Mr.
Walters states that hereafter the
mine will be known as the "Nell
