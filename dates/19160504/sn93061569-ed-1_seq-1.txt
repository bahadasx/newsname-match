CLAYTON. NEW MEXICO, THURSDAY, MAY 4, 1916.
NO. 17.
SIX DELEGATES NAMED
TO ATTEND CONVENTION
Holloman Says Wilson is Too
Versatile with Affections
Freak Luck Cannot
Save Democrats
State Committeeman H. J. Ham
mond and E. F. Gallegos, accompanied
by Dr. J. M. Winchester, O. T. Toombs,
Joan Vigil, A. S. Chavez, Carl Ek
lund, N. F. Gallegos, R. Q. Palmer and
State Land Commissioner R. P. Ervien
represented Union coufcty at the state
convention at Albuquerque last week,
to elect delegates to the national con
vention at Chicago.
The much talked of discord in the
Republican party failed to answer
when the roll was called, and Union
county did its part to "chord" with
the harmony. That Union county Re
publican forces are recognized as a
power in the state was evidenced by
our representatives being on nearly
every committee and that Eufracio
Gallegos was elected delegate to the
national convention, one of six in the
state. These delegates go uninstruct
ed. One of the features of the meeting
was the brilliant speech of Reed Hollo
man in which the Santa Fe man point
ed out that if ever the country needed
s Republican at the national helm, the
time is now. He pointed out that
even though the democrats had been
ornamented with horse-shoes and va
rious pieces of freak good luck during
their administration, they are doing
their best to make a mess of our na
tional affairs. Mr. Holloman scored
the president for his policy toward
Mexico. The speaker while on the sub
ject observed that "Mr. Wilson's af
fections have been transferred from
one bandit to another so often and
with such utter disregard for our own
interests that we have won and merit
ed the contempt of the civilized
world."
The great point in his speech how
ever, was that the fate of the G. 0. P.
rested only within the party. Ho de
fended the motives that caused the
destructive split of 1912, asserting
that it was not for selfish ain, and
while it was dectructive, temporarily,
he contended that all persons were
very much human and prone to err.
The keynote of Mr. Holloman's speech
is sounded in the following quoted
paragraph:
"Whoever is nombinated by our na
tional convention, whether fortune
should smile upon one candidate or
another, or upon that great man who
drifted, let us all resolve in the name
of our country's welfare, in the name
of our country's honor, that the nonv
inee of the Chicago convention, who
ever he may be, will be our candidate,
and will command our loyal support."

Republican Platform
The republicans of New Mexico, in
state convention assembled, reaffirm
their allegiance to the great principles
of the republican party, which have
become synonymous with the welfare
and reputation of the American peo
ple. We congratulate the people of New
Mexico and the United States that
the rule of the democratic party is
about at an end, and that now a new
era of good government and general
prosperity will begin on the fourth day
of March next. We feel that this
is assured because the people have
had another opportunity to see that
the democratic party is utterly incom
petent to conduct the government in a
creditable manner, that it knows no
thing of constructive statesmanship,
and that it fails either to give satis
faction to the people at home or to
afford them protection abroad; thus
presenting a strong contrast to the
wonderful record of the republican
party as the preserver of the nation,
the protector of its people and the
defender of its honor.
It is the highest duty of the gov
ernment of the United States to pro
tect its citizens in their rights where
ever they may be, and this nation
should be prepared to enforce such
rights at whatever cost.
We deplore, to the utmost, the feel
ing of contempt exhibited toward this
country and( its people by certaoin
foreign nations which has been brot
on, and to a large degree encouraged,
by the inefficient, vacillating and un
American handling of our foreign af
fairs by the present democratic ad
ministration.
True Americanism and preparedness
are the paramount issues of the time
the most vital issue that has been
raised in this country since the civil
war. Preparedness for war is the
greatest security for peace.
By its past history and achieve
ments, the republican party has shown
itself competent to govern in times
of stress and storm, and the people
of the country are now looking to that
party for the guiding hand and clear
thinking brain that will bring security
and protection in the midst of our
difficulties.
We condemn the democratic party
for its vacillating, uncertain and in
effective policies in regard to our re
lations with foreign countries, which
have led us to the very verge of war;
these policies have been uncertain and
dilatory and detrimental to the best
interests and welfare of our people
and our country. They have stunted
and crippled our army and navy, hin
dered their betterment, and placed
both of them upon a plane that has re
sulted in absolute insecurity to our
country and its industries.
We believe in the prosperity of the
American people and in the enactment
of such laws as will tend to give our
earners the greatest compensation for
their labors, our producers the great
est pay for their products, and our
manufacturers the greatest return for
their capital Investment and the ener
gies -which they have contributed to
their enterprises; and we believe that
such results can be attained only at
the hands of the republican party.
We believe that the democratic
party does not understand the true
principles of republican government
and is unable to inaugurate a policy
which will satisfy the American peo
ple, and in evidence of that fact we
point to the conduct of that body since
the inauguration of the present admin
istration, during which time it has
been in full power and had control
of both houses of congress and of all
the departments of state as well as the
executive.
We believe that a more direct, posi
tive and earnest policy toward the re
public of Mexico during the troubles
which have existed there since the
present democratic administration
came into power would have brought
about peace and order in that unfor
tunate country and saved millions of
dollars and the lives of thousands of
people. The policy pursued has only
been a weakness. It has resulted in
cruelty to the people of that country
and has been a hindrance in the estab
lishment of a stable government.
We commend to the attention of the
! people of our state the able efforts
of Senator Thomas B. Catron and Sen
ntor Albert B. Fall and of Representa
tive B. C. Hernandez in the congress
of the United States in the upholding
of the republican principles of gov
ernment and in the protection of the
interests and industries of the nation,
and especially of our own state of New
Mexico.
The economic principles embodied
in the republican national platform
in 1912 have been shown to be correct.
At the outbreak of the European war;
the industries of the country were al-

CHEAPER ELECTRIC CURRENT
From City Clerk M. R. Jones The
Citizen learns that upon the installa
tion of the additional electric current
generating equipment at the munici
pal plant, patrons will be urged to pur
chase electric cooking and heating de
vices. Under this system, according
to Mr. Jones, enough "juice" will be
consumed to permit the city to sell
current for 5 cents per kilowatt in
stead of the present 10 cents per kilo
watt -It is claimed that at this rate
electric current is as cheap as coal
or wood for cooking and heating pur
poses. CARD OF THANKS
(Kansas City Star)
I take this means of expressing my
heartfelt gratitude to my immediate
friends and neighbors from the North
who so kindly assisted in my numerous
deaths and burials. Should oportunity
ever offer I shall be glad to'do as
much for them.

No Graduates This Term
School closes Friday May 12tH.
'Considering everything", said Supt.
J. W. Thompson, "we have had a very
successful term."
There will be no graduates this year.
This school requires sixteen full units
for graduation and the senior class
has had only from fourteen to fifteen
units. These pupils may be able to
complete the course by Christmas next
year.
There will be no" conditional promo
tions this year, except it may be that
pupils failing in a minor study will be
permitted to try the examinations
again in September. Several eighth
grade pupils have failed in one or
more studies, but the grades on an
average are higher than usual, as
much good work has been done.
Some , field exercises are scheduled
for the last week of school, a ball
game (Clayton has not been beaten
this year), races, jumping, and shot
throwing. The smaller children will
have an outing.
Barnhart Buys Another Store
W. C. Barnhart annexed his fifth
store Monday when he purchased the
F. G. Akins grocery on the west side.
The new establishment will be known
as the West Side Grocery, E. R. Gen
try, formerly in charge for Mr. Akin,
will be manager of this store.
WANT TO JOIN THE TENNIS
CLUB?
' All young folks and older ones
too, are requested to be present at
a meeting at the Dixie Friday
night for the purpose of organiz
ing a tennis club.
Several young men are interested,
Allen Wikoff is among the most active,
in promoting the organization of a
tennis club in Clayton. Mr. Wikoff
plans it as a good-sized proposition-
consisting say of thirty or forty mem
bers, the club to be maintained and
conducted on the assessment plan
inch member paying so much each
month'. He sees it as easily possible
to have a four court lot and equipped
in the very latest style with a care
taker in charge.
Clayton has many citizens who are
pood players of this most fascinating
game, some of them are ex-champions.
We believe the plan will meet
with success from the start.
Opposition to Appeal
Attorney H. B. V o.idward has filed
,;peal from the opinion of Judge
the Clayton board of education which
was granted to restrain the board
from purchasing a site for the erec
tion of a high school. The appeal
bond has been fixed at $10,000. Late
today the bond had not been signed
by the parties Mr. Woodward is rep
resenting. A republican boy arrived at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Rubel Lujan
this week.
NEW CITY OFFICERS TO
START WORK TUESDAY
Spending $55000 for Water
Works Extension, Plant
Addition, Fire Station
and City Hall is Task
v
While the batting order in the city
board of aldermen will be changed a
little, only one man will retire from
the list, Tuesday night when the al
dermen and mayor elect begin the new
term. H. J. Hammond Sr., who has
served as mayor will be succeeded by
T. H. Rixey. Aldermen Ekhind, Otto,
and Herzstein will remain on the job
and Fulgencio C. de Bava will begin
duties filling the vacancy created by
the resignation of S. Herzstein. M.
R. Jones, city clerk, paused long
enough in his task yesterday of raking
in the glittering coin to tell the re
porter that he too, would be found ,
doing business at the same old stand. "
So far as known there will be no
changes in the appointive offices.
Year Promises to be Busy
The coming year promises to be a
busy one for the board. First In order
is the disposing of the $55,000 worth
of water works extension bonds, for
which bids will be received until May
15.
City Clerk Jones gave the reporter
a brief summary of the improvements
that are scheduled for attention. An
other well will be sunk from which
it is hoped enough additional water
vill be obtained to supply the city and
the increased consumption for several
years to come. The water mains will
be extended and additional fire plugs
installed. Another well and pump
equipment will call for additional elec
tric power, which, if installed, will be -sufficient
to carry the overload of gen
eral current
With addition of the extra power
producing facilities larger quarters
will be in demand at once. The pres
ent plan, as Mr. Jones views it, is
to build a brick addition to the muni
cipal power . house.
Though no definite plans have been
made it is stated that work will begin
before the end of the year on a modern
city hall and fire station. -J The pro
bable cost of the building has not been
estimated. - It is understood if this
building is erected there will be quar
ters for seven firemen, the fire equip
ment, council chambers, city clerk of
fice and probably two or three auxil
airay rooms.
Fire Department to Purchase Motor
According to members of the fire
department there is a positive need for
just such a building as the proposed
combination city hall and fire station.
Morgan Harvey reports that the fire
department is now in position finan
cially to purchase a motor fire truck,
but if they owned it now it would be
like having a bear without a cage
there is no suitable place at present
to harbor a motor fire truck.
Truck will Cost $2.500
According to Harvey the fire com
pany has about concluded that the 50
horse power Jeffery motor truck is
about the best thing for the money.
When the truck is installed complete,
and ready for business the company
will have expended in the neighbor
hood of $2,500.
Five Teachers Re-Elected
Up until Wednesday not enough
applications for teaching positions for
next term in the Clayton schools had
been filed with the board of education
to complete the force. Those elected
for next term are Misses Leavell, Sla
ter, Morgan, Cox, Hutchings:
Three Carloads of Fords Arrive
Three carloads of Fords arrived in
Clayton this week for the local agency,
the Pioneer Garage. One cnrlond will
go to Boise City.
Converting Ford Into Racer
Allan AVikoff, manager of the Pio
neer Garage, is remodeling a Ford into
a high-speed roadster. He has ordered
special body, wire wheels and high
tension magneto. All the work of re
h'iildin? is being done in the local
plant.
