Washington, May 4. President WIl
mm haB approved the co-operative
agreement that wan proposed at the
conference between General Scott,
i'unMtoti and Obregon, to govern fu
ture acts of the American expedition
in Mexico.
Though the president is satisfied j
with the terms, of the agreement, I
there w ill be no formal announce-.
ment of big attitude until
farrania '
has had an opportunity to approve or
reject it. .
The president and Secretary Baker
conferred at noon on Gen. Scot I'd re
port on the details of tho arrange

ment does not net any time limit on
tho expedition. The approval of Car

Scott and Kmmton $re pleased wtfli
President Wllnon's approval of plans
and General Obregon has expressed
hlmsc'f as expecting President Car
ranza will ratify the agreement before
night. He thought It likely full and
final ratification arrangements might I
be consummated In conference
today. General Obregon Is expected
to return to Mexico as soon as the
compact Is completed. Official noti
fication of President Wilson's approv
al of the plan has not been received.
It Is expect-1

El Paso, Tex., May ,-
d that the ratification of the peace
pact which was agreed upon by Gen.
Scott and Gen. Obregon. will be fol
lowed by American aid in the rehabil
itation of Mexico.
It is believed that when the official
statement announcing the details of
the arrangement Is issued It will call
for tho gradual retirement of the
American expedition within sixty
days, with the Carranzlstas cooper
ating, the use of Mexican railways
for the traimportaion of supplies
through comtrerclal agencies being
granted. 1
The United States government Is
exacted to aid in obtaining financial j "Shorty" Fletcher, a well known no
assistarice for the Carranza govern-1 gro. . )g in the oounty jau awaiting the
ment and also, to permit the' resump
tion of the exportation of arms and
munitions of war across the'border.
. It is also understood that Carranza
will revise tho mining laws of Mexico
in a manner that will permit the prof
itable operation of mines that are
owned by foreigners, consequently
giving employment to many Mexicans
who turned to banditry as a result of
unemployment and hunger.
It Is believed that the plan for the
gradual retirement of the American
troops will thwart the projected revolt
headed by Felix Diaz. The Diaz
scheme, it is predicted, will break
down as soon o the troops are with
drawn. Gen. Obregon has communicated
the tentative agreement to all the
Mexican commanders, ordering them
to Inform their troops concerning it.

To the Voters of Grady County;
In making my announcement , for

I made as county attorney I am now
standing. I made certain promises
nnd statements during my other cam
paign that I now wish to reiterate
foi I have no changes to make in my
promises at thisUime. I yet believe
thut the criminal laws of this state

In making this announcement for

not depending upon tho lawless ele

citizens who believe in the building
of homes, the establishing of schools,
and rearing of churches, for upon their
decision at the polls rests the main

(By William G. Shepherd, United;
Press Correspondent.) .
Berne, May 4. "My son and hlsj
regiment kne.w how to die but they)
didn't know how to fight."
The English father who said this
of his dead soldier son who had beea
trained only three months paints a
picture of the plight of the average
American if the United States were
plunged into war and neejded millions,
of trqops quick, 1
It's all right to know how to die,
they say here in Switzerland, but it's
better to ' know how . fight. By,
fighting you lessen your chance ot
dying. A soldier hasn't got any right
to die, unless there's nothing else left
for him to do.- ,
Fighting today is an exact science.
Read a book of military instructions.
It tells you every last thing a soldier
ought to do, hi every possible contin-,
gency. Master militarists have work-
ed it all out and put it down. Swiss,
citizen-soldiers know how to do twen
ty different things in a pinch, before
they resort to dying. - They know how;
to die too, if it comes to that.
How long does it take a Swiss
youth to l(.-arn how to fight instead ot
die? How Umg wuold it take an
American youth to learn the same,
thing? " ,
Just one hundred" and fifty-three
days'.
Of forty-eight years, a Swiss citl-
zen-soldier gives halt a year to learn
ing how to be one ot the best soldiers
iu the world. ,
In all this time be is forced to fire
only 1,000 shots. He does fire more,
it is true, because his 1,000 shots
teach him that snapshooting in tha
open air is more fun than kelly pool
shooting in a smoke-filled room.
Switzerland is full of shootine
Clubs. One hundred unit f nr t t v,
days in camp and the firing of a rifle
1,000 times in twelve years and
you've got your crack Swiss private
soldier. .
Two hundred and thirty-eight days,
taken out of a lifetime, makes a cor
poral. A sergeant is made in . 282
days and a lieutenant spends 402 days,
out of his entire life, to learn his job.
A captain of forty-eight" years has
put in OSS days, altogether. ' .
These periods of learning and ex
perience are spread over a long
stretch of time.
Tho first bit is sixty-five days.
When you're twenty years old, you
go into a military school for that
tims.
You don't give up your job to do it,
either. Let your boss try to eive vonp
job to somebody else while you're
gone, no matter whether vou'rn a
bank clerk 'or a farm hand; he'll go
to jail .If your job isn't open for you
w hen you come back.
What's more, if he has any pride
at, all, he'll pay you your wages w hile
you're gone. Let his neighbors find
out he didn't and they'll cut him
uoad.
The next year, when you're twenty,
one, youil troop off in the summer
to a military camp where you'll spend
eleven days and every summer after
that, for 10 summers, you'll spend
