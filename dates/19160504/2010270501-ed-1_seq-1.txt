his talk by reciting the following
poem:
"Where the Went Begins"
ut where the landscape's a little
stronger.
Out where the smile dwells a little
longer,
That's where the West begins.
Out where the sun's a little brighter.
Where the snows that fall are a trifle
whiter,
That's where the' West begins.
Out where the skies are a trifle bluer.
Out where friendship's a little truer.
That's where the West begins,
ut where a fresher breeze is blow
ing, Where there's laughter in every
streamlet flowing,
Where there's more of reaping and
less of sowing.
That's where the West begins.
Out where the world is in the mak
ing. Where fewer hearts with despair ar
aching. That's where the West begins.
Where there's more of singing and
les of sighing.
Where there's more of giving and
less of buying.
And a man makes friends without
half trying. "
That's where the West begins.

his night clothes the thief had gone.
Going outside he saw the man disap

SERIOUS ACCIDENT AVOIDED
Scared Horse I Can Away Tuesday
Morning, Wrecking Wagon and
Throwing Dynamite on Street
'Nothing but a streak of good' luck
saved the life of at least one man
and prevented the destruction of sev
eral buildings on Box Butte avenue
at S o'clock Tuesday morning when
a horse pulling a light wagon belong
ing to J. P. Barger, the tree expert,
and driven by an employee, became
scared and ran down Box Butte ave
nue at top speed, completely wreck
ing the wagon, slightly Injuring the
driver and scattering a hundred
sticks of dynamite over the street.
The dynamite was packed In a
box and was to be used in blasting
holes for tree planting, at wtiich Mr.
Barger has made quite a success. The
horse became scared In the north
pait of town and In spite of the ef
forts of the driver, ran full speed for
the business portion of the city.
When directly in front of the Im
perial theatre on Box Butte avenue
the light wagon overturned, throw
ing the driver under the wagon box
with the dynamite which scattered
in all directions. The horse contin
ued on his way with the wagon up
side down after pulling the reins
from the driver, who was slightly In
jured. A hundred feet farther the wagon
box became loosed and the horse con
tinued on his way with the running
gears and wheels until he collided
with the City Meat Market auto de
livery car, where he left what re
mained of the wauon and continued
on to the Burlington depot, evident
ly with the intention of catching the
first train out.
Occupants of the Drake hotel. Al
liance Garage. Newberry building
and other buildings nearby shook
hands with themselves when they
realized that if the dynamite had ex
ploded it might have blown them all
who to kingdom-come without time to
twenty-four hours to leave town. She

cording to City Siieciflcatlons
Five saloon licenses, three pool
hall licenses, plumbers' licenses and
picture show license for the fiscal
year beginning May 1 were granted
by the city council at their meeting
last Friday night.
On account of the failure of a
bonding company, which had been
furnishing the bonds, at a time too
late to take up the matter of bonds
with another company all the saloon
men furnished bonds signed by local
parties.
None of the bonds were question
ed as to the financial standing of the
signers but the bonds of King and
Riordan and Fred Rehder were re
jected with Instructions to furnish
new bonds according to the form
specified by the council. The licens
es were granted subject to the re
turn of the correct form of bond.
The saloon license Is $1400 per
year, and each petition was accom
panied by a check for this amount,
proof of publication, and bonds for
$5,000.
The licenses granted and .the
bondsmen are as follows:
Martin J. King and Homer M. Wil
son bondsmen, A. Riley and Ernest
Ponwltz.
Win. King and Frank E. Wilson
bondsmen, John Snoddy, E. E. Eld

bondsmen, Patrick King, Lincoln

Keeler.
Fred Rehder- bondsmen, Ferdin

Homer Wilson has since made ar
rangements to conduct a saloon at
the Campbell stand in the Alliance
Hotel building.
- W. P. Crane; Henry Reiser and V.
E. Byrne were granted license "to
conduct pool halls on payment of the
regular license fee of $10 per table
per year. The application of John
Bayers was withheld pending investi
gation. Mayor Romig stated that
there had been several complaints
against this place and the council de
cided to postpone action on this ap
plication until the charges could be
investigated.
Plumbers' licenses were granted to
E. A. J e Hers and P. O. Beckwell.
H. A. DuBuque was granted a li
cense for the new year for conduct
ing the Imperial theatre. Theatre
license Is $50 per year.
John R. Snyder was granted a dray
license.
Recently the council has been con
fronted with the necessity of pur
chasing a new sprinkler and they are
investigating the proposition of a
combination sprinkler that will han
dle either water or oil. Lacking
funds with which to purchase both a
sprinkler and a tractor the council
voted Friday night to table the tract
or proposition Indefinitely.

Narrowly Missed Death Monday
Morning When Wagon Ixmded
with Dynamite Overturns
SHOOTS SF.LF WHILE IN HEM-
INGFOHD LIVERY HAHN
OverNwera Guard on Train Number
42 Is Held until lloslptal
Is Reached
Mike Shesake, who narrowly es
caped Instant annihilation early Mon
day morning when the wngon which
he was driving, In which was a box
of dynamite, overturned on Box
Butte avenue, shot himself through
the left breast at 9 o'clock Tuesday
evening at the Hemingford livery
barn.
Shesake's action at Hemingford
leads some to believe that ho may
have purposely tried to kill himself
and perhaps others Tuesday morn
ing, and that the runaway was not
an accident. His only Inuries in the
runaway, when the wagon was de
molished and dynamite scattered ov
er the street, were three front teeth
broken off.
At Hemingford he had been
threatening suicide bo often that the
men with whom he associated had
begun to laugh at him. In his mut
terlngs while being taken from Hem
ingford to the hospital he mentioned
the name of a girl near that city and
It is believed that an unsuccessful
love affair was the cause of his de
spondency. Shesake purchased a cheap revolv
er in Hemingford Tuesday afternoon
and at 9 o'clock went to the livery
barn where there were three or four
men in the office. He calmly inform
ed them that he was going to kill
himself and divested himself of his
coat, vest, hat, collar and tie. Three
of the men hurriedly left, while the
other stayed to see what would hap
pen. "Now if you will kindly step
outside," he said to the fourth, "I
will do the deed." The fourth did
step outside and all were startled a
moment later by the report of the
gun. They started to the barn when
Shesake walked to the door, leaned
gainst the jamb and said to them.
"What In .. do you want here?
He colapaed anC they called a doctor,
who found that be had shot himself
un above the heart on the left aide.
Train number forty-two waa stop
ped an hour later and 8hesake was
placed on board with a guard. He
waa only partial? conscious but at
Berea became violent and overpow
ered the guard, who had to call for
help. He waa placed in the hospital
at Alliance and it waa reported this
morning that he waa getting along
as well as could be expected.

' A MUSICAL COLUMN
New Department In The Herald He
gin This Week, Edited by
prof. Ralph n. Vnlacke .r
We take pleasure in announcing to
our subscribers and readers of a new
feature in our paper. Beginning
with thla issue and continuing each
week we shall run a Musical Column,
edited by Ralph R. Unlacke, violinist
with the Alliance School of Music.
This column is to be devoted to ev
erything in music. Mr. Unlacke's
own words will explain this column
more adequately. He says: "I know
that business men and women do not
have the time to wander through
endless volumes and treaties on the
subject of music to enable themselves
to become familiar with this vast
subject. But the average thought
ful person does wander through the
newspaper In search of things of In
terest, and short articles on various
ubjects attract their attention, and
hese they read with absorbing In
:erest. What 1 want to do is to tell
lie busy men and women of Alliance
he Story of Music, briefly and con
cisely; to show them the relation of
Music to their lives."
Mr. I'niacke will endeavor to an
swer any reasonable question upon
'he subject of music, and frankly
onfesH his inability should the quen
. ion be beyond hiB scope. It is hop-
I that this column will be of vital
'Merest to everyone whether u usic-
lly inclined or not. Step by step
his column will take you through
he birth, growth, and the tlnal de
velopment of the eternal value of
Music. Read the first article and h
"t a foretaste of those that are to
ollow.
