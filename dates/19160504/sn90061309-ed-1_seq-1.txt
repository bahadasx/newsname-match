every one of the candidates in
truly broncho-busting fashion clung
to his mount with an indomitable
determination and there was no
pussy-foot about it either.
After the degrees were conferred
the local members augmented by
contingents from Hannibal, Moberly
Shelbina and BrookBeld numbering
in all one hundred and sixty betook
themselves to the opera house
where a delightful banquet was
prepared and served by the good
ladies who decorated the hall very
neatly indeed for the occasion. The
national colors swung from the
sides and ceiling, flowers of various
hues were tastily placed here and
there through the hall and the
whole effect was that of a pretty
picture set in a frame of American
Beauties. By the way we noticed
the young men were entirely pre
occupied with admiration for the
frwinc' work which is not usually
the case in inspecting works of urt.
We do not know the number of
courses served because we went at
them so ravenously under the
appetizing inspiration of excellent
music that we lost track of the
count.
Among the musical numbers

Lucille Proctor's singing of a Liitle

feature of the game was the work
of the Monroe batter Christian and
Forrest, The rest of the team did
themselves proud and showed that
the team this year is even stronger
than ever before and the fans of
this vicinity are sure of getting
their money's worth this season.

Monday morning he went to

the nose with such force that it
broke the bone. The setting of the I church in the world

Painful Accident
Mrs. Janes, wife of J. L. or as he
is better known. "Gibbs" Janes, who
lives 7 miles south of town, had a
painful accident last Thursday.
Mr. and Mrs. Janes and a neigh
bor who was calling at the Janes
home, were sitting talking and Mrs.
Janes arose and started to cross
the room. She fell, breaking her
hip. The limb was set and she is
doing as well as could be expected
Mrs. Jan is 66 years of age and
we trust it will not be long until
the bone is mended.
