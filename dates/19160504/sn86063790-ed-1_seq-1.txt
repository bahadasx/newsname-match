Interesting Story of a $100 Bill.
isn
SEg&r/-,.. v
In the April American Magazin
we read as follows:
^ "Mrs. Davis came into possessio
of a $100 bill. Prizing this mone
because it was the first she eve
earned, she kept the original bill i
her possession most of the time o
her person. Only a short time be
fore her death were her relative
aware that she still had the bill.
"When a little girl, nine year
old, she deposited $10 in a saving
I bank, and received a pass book. Sh
carried this book with her for 7
years. Three weeks before he
her death she told her grandson sh
was curious to know if the bank wa
still doing business and what ha
become of her $10 deposit. A let
ter giving the number of her pas
book, the amount of the deposit an
her maiden and present name, wa
written. Just one week from th
y) day the letter was posted a reply wa
rpp^ived to the effect that the d
posit, together with the accrued ir
terest for 75 years, amounting i
all to $325.65, was in the bank fo
Mrs. Davis.
Had she deposited the hundre
dollar bill with a savings bank paj
ing 4 per cent, interest compounde
quarterly, the principal and interes
would have amounted to the hand
some sum of $601.89. The bi'
would have earned for her five othe
$100 bills.
* "Her investment at nine years c
* ^ age multiplied itself for her* thirtj
one times. Her sentiment at th
age of 39 persisted in for 45 yean
.deprived her of many comforts i
her old age which the $600 woul
' have provided."

WHAT CLOVER DOES,
h
Thousand Farmers Gather.on Farm
y in Greenwood County.
a "
Greenwood, April 27.?Approximately
one thousand farmers from
Greenwood, Abbeville, Anderson,
? Laurens, Edgefield, Saluda and even
R other counties gathered today at
_ Hodges, in this county, to see the
lo
wonderful transformation wrought
on ordinary lands by crimson clover, j
r the great work done in the past few
^ vears bv Mr. Bob S. Hodges, the
a
banker-farmer, of t. at little town.
^ The meeting was planned *by Director
W. W. Long, of the State extension
department, and the details arranged
by County Demonstration Agent C.
B. Faris, of Greenwood. It was a
complete success in every way. The
h farmers came by train, trolley, au5.
tomobiles, wagons and buggies. After
a practical demonstration in the
e big fields dinner was had, and after
dinner addresses we re made by Mr. r
u Bob Hodges, the Hon. W. W. Long
and Deputy Directors Barton and
?, Stewart. These gentlemen proved to
j. the farmers present that the clovers
and other legumes are the things
i- with which to enrich South Carolina
soils, that they dc s > with less cost
and more lastingly than any com>
mercial fertilizer in the world. Mr.
t- Long was of the opinion after the
e meeting that much good had been
s done in getting farmers to come and
o see at first hand what wonderful
work had been done at Hodges by
Mr. Bob Hodges. On a six-horse
farm last year Mr. Hodges used $110
worth of fertilizer and made fifteen
e bales of cotton to the horse. His
land is ordinary sandy land,

11 Song Like a Canary's.
s Harkness Piatt, rancher and poultryman,
is convinced that there has
s been philandering going on among
s the members of his brood of black
? orpingtons. Else why should an ap?
parently ordinary hen, otherwise well
r behaved, suddenly produce notes
e from her throat like a canary?
s Piatt avers that one of his birds
^ of which he suspected no unusual
tendencies in her youth, though he
1S was surprised never to hear a cackle
^ from her as she grew up, has suddens
ly started to sing with several of the
e notes and at least a suggestion of the <
s fluency of a pet warbler. Piatt does
not profess to explain the phenomen

n in his flock before.
r The hen was born, as he remembers,
under the usual circumstances,
^ with the exception that the egg from
which she evolved was one of only
^ two upon which her maternal parent
sat and that the other did not hatch
out at all. The little chick grew as
11 little chicks do into a regular hen,
r apparently happy when it was well!
fed, but always silent.
^ When the hen had grown beyond!
the broiler stage Piatt was feeding
e his brood one afternoon. As he toss5'
ed some grain in this hen's direction
n she suddenly looked up at him and
^ began to sing. It was no ordinary j
barnyard song at all, but melodious !
and rhythmical and suggestive of the !
l" treetops and spring. Since that day,
o when the chanticleers of the flock
d I greet the morn in the usual manner

CONFEDERATE REUNION ENDS.
Rock Hill Did Herself Proud by Entertaining.
Rock Hill, April 27.?The veterans
of the Confederate States of America
have left and the reunion of 1916
is now history. Rock Hill did everything
in her power, from the highest
to fhe lowest citizen, to make the old
heroes who wore the grey have a
good time in one of the few reunions
remaining to them, and they expressed
themselves as highly pleased with
their brief stay in "the good town.'
A.s is usual, the sidelights of the occasion
were the brightest. The camp
fire talks on the Witherspoon lawn
was one of the features most enjoyed.
The big lawn, containing sever
acres, and set thickly with watei
oaks, was thickly strung with myriads
of colored electric lights anc
bright bonfires burned in all parts
of the grounds. A gaily decorated
and lighted stand was in one side
for the Veteran staff, the governoi
and staff and the sponsors and maids
of honor. Short speeches were made
stories were told and delightful oldtime
songs were sung by Mesdames
J. B. Steele and R. Z. Thomas. Several
thousand were present and the
scene was most inspiring. Visitors
remarked that the scene was almosl
as gay as Coney island.
Wednesday evening Main street
from Hampton to Depot, was ropec
off, and under the brilliant white
way lights hundreds of couples danced
upon the asphalt, while the veterans
and visitors had several sets
of old-time dances going to the music
of an excellent band. After this the
sponsors' ball was given at Fried
heim's hall, with music Dy jonnson j
orchestra. Even in this some of the
old vets joined, tripping the lighl
fantastic like youngsters. The veterans
unanimously voted the "blue
ribbon" to Rock Hill.
At the concluding business sessior
of the reunion yesterday many matters
of importance were discussed
One matter discussed was that of the
efforts of the South Carolina divisior
to have all Confederate soldiers oi
the State, regardless of physical oi
financial condition, pensioned. This
discussion followed the report of the
committee in charge as to their efforts
to get the legislature interested
in the matter, and Col. Alfred Aldrich,
of Barnwell, announced his in
tention of being a candidate for th<
next general assembly upon this issue.
They very properly conside]
this a matter of great importance
and the committee was continued.
Another matter considered was
the desirability of having the nexi
general reunion of Confederate vet
erans meet in Washington, D. C.
with the Grand Army of the Repub
lie, this proposition having beer
made by a G. A. R. camp of Wash
ington, ana an invitation win De ex
tended to the Confederates at thei:
reunion in Birmingham. There wai
some opposition to holding a reunior
outside of a Confederate State, anc
the matter was finally disposed of tn
tabling the motion to send unin
structed delegates to the general re
union.
The division went on record b}
adopting a resolution endorsing the
movement to have the federal gov
ernment refund the "cotton tax" col
lected from the Southern people af
ter the war and strongly endorsee
the bill introduced in the house bj
Congressman John M. Tillman, o1
Arkansas, and in the senate by Senator
E. R. Tillman, of South Carolina,
which bill proposes to refunc
this tax in the form of pensions tc
Confederate veterans.
INSURANCE LAW UPHELD.
Supreme Court Passes on Anti-Compact
Act.
Columbia, April 27.?Upholding
tfie legality of the Laney-Odom Fire
Insurance act, the supreme court in
i decision tonight refused to sign
in order enjoining the insurance
commissioner and the attorney general
from enforcing the terms of the
law.
The petitions of David B. Henderson,
a Charleston insurance man, for
in injunction, was dismissed by the
court. The opinion was written by
Associate Justice Fraser.
"The petition is dismissed and the
injunction refused," concluded an order
which was igned by all of the
justices of the supreme court.
The State officials were represented
in the case by Thos. H. Peeples. attorney
general. The anti-compact
law, which was passed by the last
general assembly, will continue in
force. Since the passage of the law
more than sixty fire insurance companies
have withdrawn from the
State.

l Monday, principally for the purpose
' of electing delegates to the State
. i Democratic convention, which will be
> held in Columbia on Wednesday, May
l 17. From the reports it appears that
- a spirit of harmony characterized
l practically every meeting and in very
few were there contests of any con
sequence. The outstanding feature
I was the endorsement of the adminis3
tration of President Woodrow Wilson j
I in every county, some of which in-j
j structed their delegates to support inj
* the State convention resolutions for a j
5 delegation to the national convention |
, instructed to vote for the renomina-.
- tion of President Wilson.
5 In many of the conventions the I
- county-to-county campaign system J
i was not mentioned, but where it was:
3 discussed, in the majority of cases j
t the decision was in favor of retaining j
what has become known as the "bi,
ennial circus." The Florence con1
vention passed a resolution asking
j the State convention to permit the
- people of the State to vote in the
- primary this summer on the ques3
tion of abolishing or keeping the pres;
ent system. In many counties the
i delegates seemed indifferent on this
- matter.
3 According to the report from Beaui
fort the Christensen faction was in
t control of the convention and elected!
- its officers and delegates, but it seems
3 that the opposition faction withdrew
and that a protest will be made be
t fore the State convention.
ADVICE FROM FARMERS' WIFE.
' A Farm Without a Garden is a Poor
1 Place to Live.
F
I wish to say a few words about
m
gardening, because I think a farm
without a garden?not merely a place
J called a garden, but a garden with
' something growing in it all the year
round?is a mighty poor place to
live. And all it takes to have a
good garden is to properly prepare
' the ground and plant the right seed
at the right time.
(
> I plant onions, lettuce, turnips
and sow cabbage seed about the 15th
, of September, and set out cabbage
t plants about the loth of November
Last year I sowed cabbage seed the
25th of September, and the plants
were so tender they did not stand the
l winter weather. The seed should
not be sowed later than the 15th of
September. I sow the Early Jersey
p Wakefield, and my home-grown
? plants about the 15th of November.
1 I have ever bought. I began plantI
ing beans about the 10th of March
and keen on Dlanting about every 10
days until the 15th of September, and
I have green beans from the last
days of April until the freezes in No7
vember. Peanuts and potatoes are
3 our most profitable truck crops, and
we can grow enough of either to fatten
our hogs on a piece of ground
that would not make more than five
j bushels of corn. Any farmer who
7 does not raise corn, wheat, oats,
f peas, sweet and Irish potatoes, peanuts,
beef, pork, clover and rye, and
make his land better instead of poorI
er, is a mighty poor farmer, no matj
ter how much cotton he makes.
Very early last spring I noticed
that where I had had green onions,
1 * 1 3 ?? n-cnnrir? or oil wiT1 -
16tLUC6 ciLI CI L cl U Ud^ c ? A u iiig ui i ?* aM
ter there were a great many cutworms.
I sometimes found as many
as 12 around a single bunch of onions,
and they were bad all summer
' in that part of the garden. Where
5 one has a winter garden the plot
1 should be changed every year. Cab1
bage, corn, in fact nearly everything,
! will grow better if the ground is
changed. A garden should never be
J allowed to grow up in weeds and
grass. All the ground that is not
planted in the fall should be turned
under and covered with manure.?

Colleton, Beaufort, Jasper and Hampton
Unite in Organization.
Walterboro, April 28.?With initial j
financial pledges aggregating $4,000
the Southern association was organized
ed here this afternoon by representatives
from four counties, Colleton, ?
Beaufort, Jasper and Hampton. The
following officers were elected: W.
W. Smoak, of Walterboro, president;
Neils Christensen, of Beaufort, vice
president; R. M. Jefferies, of Walterboro,
secretary and treasurer; directors,
W. E. Richardson, of Beaufort;
E. T. Shaffer, of waiter ooro; jl. u.
Altman, of ftidgeland; J. S. Williams
and M. M. Chisolm, of Hampton, and.
the officers ex-officio.
The next meeting of the association
will be held in Hampton, the
date to be fixed later. Considerable
enthusiasm was shown at the meeting,
and it was evident that the citizens
present from the four counties
interested meant business.
The object of the association,
broadly speaking, is 'the industrial
development of this section. A competent
man will be employed as a
secretary, and it is confidently expected
that with the cooperation of
all the people of this section the
movement will bring about highly
satisfactory results.
The delegates and newspaper men
assembled this morning at Ritter,
near here, as the guests of Messrs.
Paul Sanders and Lemacks, proprie- , ^
tors of the Colleton Mercantile and
Manufacturing company. The visitors
were splendidly entertained, an
old time barbecue being the principal
attraction. Tonight they were the
guests of the Walterboro chamber of
commerce at a delightful banquet at
the Hotel Albert, where enthusiastic
talks were made regarding the en
terprise just landed by some of the
most substantial citizens of Colleton,
Beaufort, Jasper and Hampton coijnties.
Giving Orders.
The pro-German sources of American
propaganda have broken out
anew after a lull in their activities.
Apparently they are unable to resist
the opportunity./to be stupid and
to belator the administration to
swallow everything it has ever said
about armed merchantmen as payment
for German "concessions" in
the Lusitania controversy. In this
respect we have the Detroit Free
Press commenting on the latest outbreak:
"George Sylvester Viereck, editor'
of the P^therland, which for all
practical purposes is the official organ
of Mr. Viereck? Is it in the nature
of a general caution? Or is it
a threat? Or is it an authorized
message from Mr. Viereck's master?
Again the gentleman says:
"If we desire to remove every pos*
sibility of friction and we desire to
safeguard the lives of our citizens,
there is only one peaceful course
open to us; the United States must
declare without delay that citizens
traveling on .board armed ships of
belligerents do so at their own risk.
' *j51
"Or, as Senator Lodge would construe
such a declaration, we must
enter into alliance with Germany in
this matter.
"Is this a command that Mr. Vie- t
, *
reck delivers to the American na
t v?
tion? And from whom? Who told *
the editor of the Fatherland to give
out this ultimatum informing us that
there is only one peaceful course left
open?
ft *?io
o f.nmmanH it ia AlfiO

warning, a warning to be prepared
later. Of course, Mr. Viereck does
not say he is the unaccredited ambassador
from Berlin, vice Bernhard
Dernburg, but it does seem queer
that he should be sending this editorial
utterance of his out broadcast at
his own expense."
The Fatherland has, of course,
been for long under suspicion .as a
publication brought into being not
merely to express and reflect hyphenated
thought in this country, but
really the official medium of expression
to the Germans and Austrians
in this country by the imperial
German government, that
Bernstorff being necessarily limited
in his activities in talking direct to
the American people has hired Viereck
to do it. This may or may not

In a modern battle 100,000 men
may be killed and wounded, but the
tubercle bacillus slaughters 147,600
of our citizens yearly, and 1,500,000
remain infected, the greater number
of which will die of tuberculosis.
