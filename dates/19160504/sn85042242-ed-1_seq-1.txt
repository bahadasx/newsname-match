Germany's answer to the American

Ireland daily is improving. Augustine
Birrell, chief secretary for Ireland,
lias resigned. He has acknowledged
that he underestimated theSinn-Fein
er movement and tlie possibility of
disturbances in Ireland. No fighting
of great importance is reported from
any of the battle fronts. In the sec­
tor of Lemort Homme, northeast.
Verdun, the French have taken ad­
ditional German positions, and cap­
tured in the operations about 100
prisoners and four machine guns.
In the Adamello sector of the Aus

Italians still are engaged in the hard
fighting that has been progress for
several days, but with no important
changes in positions reported.
HOLD CONFERENCE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE
Washington, May —President Wil­
son, Secretary Lansing and Col. E.
!M. House held a long conference to­
night at the White iHouse. It is un­
derstood that the submarine situation
was discussed, but Secretary Lansing
said later he had received no word
from Berlin regarding the character
of the German note, which press dis­
patches said probably will be handed
to Ambassador Gerard tomorrow. The
president and his advisers are keep­
ing their minds open while waiting for
the German note. The long delay
very evidently has created a bad im­
pression, however, and it was author­
itatively stated today that the issue
will have to be cleared up this week
if diplomatic relations with Germany
are to continue.
iXo proposals of any kind will be
accepted by the American govern­
ment. it is said unless they include
a declaration of intent to stop sinking
peaceful ships at once. In this con­
nection press dispatches to the effect
that German submarine commanders
would be told of in the German note
read with interest by officials, but
comment was withheld pending the
disclosure of the nature of the in­
structions. Col. House, who discuss­
ed the submarine issue with German
officials while abroad, arrived here
this morning. His coming to Wash­
ington was considered significant be­
cause he has taken an active part in
the German negotiations to date.
The government military bill for
immediate general compulsion passed
its first reading in the house of com­
mons today. Its passage was loudly
cheered.

The Zeppelin air laid on the north­

Finding of
Body Clears
Up Mystery
Philadelphia, Pa., .May 3.—iWith a
handkerchief tightly wound around
his neck, the body of Richard Micken,
who was believed to have been kid­
napped last November, was discover­
ed tonight beneath a strip of under­
brush. on the outskirts of the city.
The police believe he was murdered
by a degenerate. A letter received by
the child's mother, last January, en­
closed a diagram, showing where the
body of the boy. who the writer said
had been murdered, would be found.
The spot indicated in this diagram is
only a short distance from the place
where Ihe :body was found.
Requests Come in to Secretary of
State From Various Parts
of State.
SIGNERS ARE URGED
TO WITHDRAW NAMES
That a number of voters who
signed the petitions to have the state
capital moved to N'ew Rockford are
regretting their ill-advised move is
evidenced by the number of retju^fS
being received at the office of the sec.
retary of state to have their names
stricken from the petitions.
During Ihe past week any number
of letters have been received from
various parts of the slate from
VOL
ers who signed the petitions. It is
evident that a number of the signers
did not realize what they were doing
when they attached their names to a
petition lo have the capital moved.
Many of them realize now what it
will mean to the taxpayers of the
state and are more than anxious to
back down on the proposition. The
glib tongued solicitors who were paid
for securing signatures to the New
Rockford petitions, talked hundreds
of voters into signing, and in a num
ber of instances misrepresented facts
to them.
II. is not loo late yet to have your
name taken off the list, if you were
a signer, and voters in all parts of
the state are urged to communicate
with Ihe secretary of state and re­
quest. that he strike their names off
the petitions. A request by letter or
postal card bearing the signature of
the signer, sent to the secretary of
state, will be sufficient and voters
are urged to do this at once, a3 the?
have only a few more days.

Dr. Tracy and A. W. Lucas Will
Erect Building at Third and
Broadway.
A. W. Lucas and Dr. Tracy an­
nounced yesterday that they will build
a two or three-story fireproof struc­
ture opposite the Hughes Electric
general offices. Plans have been pre­
pared and probably the entire prop­
erty, fifty feet on Third street and
140 feet on Broadway will be utilized.
The owners of this tract have had
several fine offers but refused to sell,
prefering to improve it themselves.
On the first floor will be stores and
the second and third floors will be
used for offices. The building will be
strictly modern throughout.
With the $100,000 hotel, the federal
building, the Hughes Electric building,
this section of the city has shown re­
markable improvement.
It has been announced that the new
hotel will be called the Van Horn In­
stead of the Dakota, as originally
planned.

BOAST OP THEIR
NEW PAY STREAK
North Dakota Proves a More
Beneficial Field for "Reds"
Than Washington.
(From Bismarck Public Opinion.)
Spokane, Wash., May 3.—(Special
dispatch to the Public Opinion.) To
"Brother" R. B. Martin, ex-preacher,
farmer for one year, co-operative
warehouse promoter, and more re­
cently a socialist lecturer, is given the
credit in Spokane for opening up the
new field lor exploitation in North' Da­
kota. Martin was engaged last, sum­
mer for a series ol' lectures by the
North Dakota farmers' organization.
After surveying the field he saw great­
er possibilities than the state of Wash­
ington had yet afforded and then op­
ened negotiations for the entry or
David C. Coates of Spokane into the
field, At that, time Coates was in a
campaign for election as city com­
missioner in Spokane, on the outcome
of which hung his decision as to the
North Dakota venture. The election
went against Coates, and a few days
afterwards he announced his intention
of quitting Spokane and shiftiner to a
new base, which he did, without
further delay. With Coates have
gone Oliver C. Morris, Herbert Gaston
and Ralph Harmon, newspapermen of
Spokane, employed to uncover the
tracks of the so-called wily politicians
of North Dakota.
From time, to time since the depart
kane reports have been received here
of the "gold mine" uncovered by Mar­
tin and Coates in the farmers' organ­
ization of North Dakota. Stories of a
bank account contributed by farmers,
ranging from $300,000 to $500,000,
have been whispered by Coates' con
1'uleiHiaL ft'icndr., wlui have frfeely
predicted that he will make a "kill­
ing" before returning here, if he ever
comes back. The mechanical equip
men I of a defunct newspaper at Seat
lie lias been purchased through the
agency of one A. W. Swenson, of
Seattle, a former Coafes' henchman,
who went to North Dakota to erect
the plant. Swenson on his return
stopped l'or :i day or two in Spokane
and amazed Coates' old-time followers
by his stories of the biir things his
former chief was about to unload on
the unsuspecting voters of North Da
kola.
D. ('. Coates for 20 years lias lived
by various movements in which he
has posed as the champion of the la­
boring classes, lie first attracted at­
tention in Colorado, where he was
elected lieutenant-governor under
'Bloo'dy Bridles" Waite in a fusion of
populists, socialists and oilier dissat­
isfied elements. Alter awhile the Col­
orado workingmen had their eyes
opened. They realized that they had
been exploited by Coates and his sun
soon set in that state.
Coates was next heard from at: Wal­
lace, Idaho, where he turned up as the
editor of a mining paper. Here he
associated with the most radical ele­
ments, and soon ascended to a posi­
tion of leadership. Then the Stunen
herg murder in Idaho occurred,
Coates' name was drawn into the case
by Harry Orchard, the star witness,
and Coates soon found Wallace not
to his likine. He disposed of his pa­
per in Wallace and about 1907 turn­
ed up in Spokane.
Coates' first work in Spokane was
as editor of the Lnbor vvtarld, a
weekly newspaper ostensibly publish­
ed in the interests of the labor un­
ions. Coates with his usual power of
organization soon gathered around
him a following of trusted lieutenants,
with whose aid he secured control of
the central labor council. From this
Coates spread his way into a number
of local unions until about 1910 he
had the most formidable political or­
ganization, ostensibly conducted as a
labor body, that Spokane ever knew.
He then swung organized labor be­
hind the campaign for a commission
form of government in Spokane,
which was auproved by the voters in
December, 1910. In March, 1911. the
prestige Coates had obtained through
his control of the labor movement was
sufficient to secure his election as
city commissioner for a term of near­
ly three years.
The disorganization, strife and tur­
moil that ensued at the citv hall dur­
ing the three years Coates was com­
missioner, would fill a book. In Nov­
ember, 1913, he appeared for re­
election but was defeated. Again in
November, 1915, after continuously
keeping before the nublic through the
organization of various leagues, he
tried for re-election, but' failed. Prior
to this election it was freely predict­
ed that in case of defeat Coates would
seek new fields and subsequent devel­
opments have justified this prophecy.
TOOK ONE CHANCE TOO MANY.
IMott, N. D„ May 3.—Chance Hamil­
ton was correctly named, for he took
one too many chances with a bull
which had frequently attacked him.
He was found unconscious in the pas­
ture with several broken ribs and in­
ternal injuries which caused his

TO
Not Known What Would Be
Accessary to Replace .S.
as Second 'n Sea Power.
Washington, May 3.—(Secretary
Daniels today transmitted to Repre­
sentative Butler of Pennsylvania,
ranking republican member of the
house naval committee, a report of
the general board of the navy, show­
ing that because of the lack of infor­
mation regarding additions to Europe­
an navies since the war began it is
impossible to state what building and
personnel program would be neces­
sary to re-establish the United States
in second place among the world's
sea powers.
Mr. Butler recently asked that he
be furnished with such a statement.
The board included in its report a
survey of the fleets of the principal
powers as they stood on July 1, 1914,
most of the information which was
given by Rear Admiral E'enson in his
testimony before the naval commit­
tee. Representative Butler specified
that the progress he wished outlined
was one that would put the navy in
second place in three years. The re­
port says that, according to its best
information the country is now equip­
ped to begin building simultaneously
within six months, five dreadnaughts,
five battle cruisers, nine scout cruis­
ers 22 destroyers and an unlimited
number of submarines.
Mr. Butler asked for statements al­
so as to when the American navy
dropped from second place.
The board replied that there were
several standards of determining na­
val strength.
"The United iStntes lost second po­
sition," the report adds, "because it
did not build ships and provide per­
sonnel to meef Ihe well known build­
ing program of the nation now sec­
ond in naval strength." and refers to
the German laws of 1S9S and 1900.

POSITION OF AMERICAN
FORCES TO BE CHANGED
Washington, May 3.—A long telegram in code reached the war depart*
ment late tonight, from Gen. Scott at El Paso, giving a full report on his 1
conference with Gen. Obregon, the Carranza war minister. Up to the
time Ihe message was decoded the Washington government had no of*
ficial knowledge of the result of the discussion between the two military
advisers, although administration officials had made no secret of thelrsat
isfactlon over the news in press dispatches from the border saying that
an understanding had been reached and danger of a clash with the- de
l'aclo government removed.
Gen. Scott sent a brier message during the day tliat he was preparing
a full report, for later transmission to Secretary Baker. The secretary
and Gen. Bliss, acting chief of staff, were on watch for the report all
day and until far into the night. As Ihe hours passed, however, it be­
came clear that no action toward ratification of the agreement could be
taken until after President Wilson had studied Gen. Scott's dispatch to­
morrow.

Chief Harry Thompson of the city
lire department is satisfied that the
capital city has more than ample fire
protection now that the two new
booster pumps are installed and ready

A preliminary test was given tli*
pumps yesterday by -Chief Thompson
to satisfy himself that they would do
Ihe work, and he was more than
pleased with the results. Mayor A.
W. Lucas and R. :l-. Best, city commis­
sioner, were also present and witness­
ed Ihe test.
The city tire hose was attached to
Ihe hydrant, near the Auditorium, and
a stream was easily thrown over the
top of the flagstaff on the building. A
pressure of din pounds was maintain­
ed at the hydrant during the test, and
a pressure of 1 !!." lbs. at the nozzle.
A pressure of 12" pounds was main­
tained at. the city booster pump, which
is a greater pressure than will ever
be required.
The pump at the state capital was
also tested and was found equally sat­
isfactory. A stream was thrown over
the roof of the building.
The test yesterday proved that the
booster pumps will give E'ismarck
better protection against lire than any
city in the state can boast of. Chief
Thompson and all who witnessed the
tests were more than pleased at tlitf
results.

Reports of the progress of Method­

presented to the Methodist general
conference tonight by two of the mis­

meeting nominated Bishop Lewis for
China and Bishop Harris for Korea
and Japan. Some little flurry was
caused by the introduction of a reso­
lution expressing regrets because
wines are reported to be served at
dinners at the White House. The
resolution would have the conference
appeal to President Wilson to "abol­
ish the wine cup for all functions over
which he has control," and would re­
quest the president to endorse and
support measures pending for nation­
wide prohibition. It was introduced
by Rev. O. A. Anderson of Oregon,

Mexico will take place in about two
months, it was learned here tonight.
American officers will make no com­
ment on the subject.
On assurance from Gen. Carranza
that the bandits are dispersed, the
northward movement of American
troops will attain full speed and it
will not be long before the last troop­
er crosses the border.
In the meantime there will be. a
constant movement of American de­

It is probable that no American
troops movement will be jftgun rt'ntil
the formal signing of an agreement
by the two governments.
it is generally understood here that
the first step to be taken will be a
gradual retirement northward of the
American forces, while the Carranza
troops plunge into the campaign
against Ihe Villistas.
Troops to Co-operate.
It is understood that. Gen. Obregon
is pledged to throw every available
ounce of his military strength into
the hunt for the marauding band.
The American force will aid greatly
because of its position. It will effect­
ually block any flight northward of
the bandits.
Every effort will be made to avoid
conflicts between the natives and the
American troopers. The latter are
to keep out of all towns and villages
an dto make every effort to escape
contact, with Mexicans.
The retirement of the Americans
will be dignified and contingent upon
the effective co-operation of the Mex­
icans.
Following his conference yesterday
and last night with Gen. Obregon, the
discussion occupying 12 hours, Gen.
Scott slacked a few hours today and
then started to work filing a report
with Secretary /Baker at Washington.
Preparations of the report consumed
all of the morning.
Over in Juarez great satisfaction
was expressed hy Mexican officials.
