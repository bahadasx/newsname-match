BOONE WATAUGA COUNTY, THURSDAY MAY 4, 1916.
NO. 38.
lit Tbi Itpublicins Also Nominate Wil
son. New York World.
Were Woodrow Wilson a Re
publican President, with a record
of achievement identical with his
record as a Democratic Presi
dent, the Republicans would nom
inate him by acclamation.
They would point to the revis
ion of the tariff under his admin
istration as the fulfillment of Mc
Kinley's dying pledge, which
Roosevelt shirked and in which
Taft failed.
They would point to the bank
ing and currency law as the
greatest piece of financial legisla
tion yet enacted a law which has
made' it possible for the United
States not only to weather suc
cessfully the devastating war in
human history, but to aspire to
the financial mastery of the world .
They would point to the income-tax
law as a just and equi
table means of making wealth
bear its due proportion of the
cost of government, for which the
Republican Party was entitled to
a double share of credit because
a Republican Congress had sub
mitted the amendment to t h e
Constitution which made the lev
ying of an income tax possible.
They would point to thecorpo
ration tax as the extension of an
act which the Republican Party
origininated and which helped to
transfer to organized capital
some of the burdens of govern
ment previonsly borne by pover
ty and labor.
They would point to the repeal
of the coastwise provision of the
Panama Canal tolls act as proof
that the United States is faithful
to its treaty pledge, and cannot
be swayed from the ways of inter
national honor and justice by the
mercenary greed of special inter
est. They would point to the Feder
al Trade Board as a progressive
measure of constructive legisla
tion by which honest and law-abiding
business was protected
from indiscriminate prosecution
and emsbled to work in harmony
with the Sherman anti-trust act,
in fairness to competition and
in fairness to the public.
They would point to the record
of the Department of Justice as
proof that business had been em
ancipated from political black
mail and that industrial organ l
jationswere no longer persecu
ted from motives of partisan ad
vantage or private revenge.
They would point to the Presi
dent's Mexican policy, identical
as it is with Lincoln's Mexican
policy, as evidence that the Amer
lean people where no less deter
mined than ever to give the back.
ward nations of this hemisphere
tha fullest ODUortunitv to work
- " i
out their destiny, and finally a
chieve that liberty under law
which' even the most enlightened
of peoples have had to gain by
struggle and sacrifice.
They would point to our new
relations with Latin-America as
the relation of J. 0. Blain'sdream
of Pan-Americanism a dream
that became a realty only though
the far-sighted "statesmanship
of Woodrow Wilson.
They would point to the for
x m t T a. J.-
eign policy oi tne r resident uu
ring the most difficult and criti
- cal period of history since the Civ
il war an a suDrerae endeavor to
maintain the highest American
ideal of peace- with honor. And
they would say of the ultimatum
to Germany as Le Matin oi rar
is. says of it voicing the idea
ism that makes France and the
. United States forever kin "one
of the noblest acts in the history
of mankind "
They would point to his lead
ership of Congress as the sola
; tion of a problem that has so
ri African government
New Fish Regnlatioos For The Western
Coooties.
By reason of the rules of the
United States Fisheries Commis
sion they would absolutely refuse
to furnish fish to any locality
where the laws were inadequate
to protect them.
By reason of the adaptability
of the streams of Wilkes, Watau
ga, Caldwell and Ashe counties
for the propogation of the moun
tain trout und other game fish,
the Fish Commission of North
Carolina have wisely passed the
following laws for their protect
ion: "That it shall be unlawful for
any person or persons, firm or
corporation to catch or kill any
fish of any kind, with seine, trap,
nets, gigs or snares or by means
of poison or explosives of any
kind or otherwise destroying any
fish except with hook and line
and fish basket in any of the
waters of the natural streams,
rivers or creeks in Counties of
Wilkis, Ashe, Watauga and Cald
well. And it shall be unlawful to
take with hook and line or any
other appliance or apparatus,
whatsoever, any fish of any kind
from any of the aforesaid waters
in any of said counties under the
size of six inches, or on Sunday."
In view of the fact that plenti
tul game and game fish have
brought more prospectors and
investors to North Carolina than
any other one thing it id hoped
that all citizens interested in the
upbuilding ana advancement oi
our state will give their hearty
operation.
by which comprehensive legisla
tive programmes can be euacted
into law without the President's
coercing uongress or DriDing it
with patronage.
They would point to his pre
paredness measures as full a
tonemeruent for past derelictions
on the part of the Republican
nartv. and as an example of
eadership that knows how, in
times of national peril, to bring
irreconcilable political elements
into harmony for the public wel-
are.
They would point to the Ad
ministration of Wilson as sec
ond only to the Administrations
of Washington and Lincoln in
the record of lnicrhty achieve
ment in behalf of the American
people.
All this and more would Re
publicans say of Woodrow W il
son if he were a Republican Pres
ident. Why should the fact that
lie is a Democratic President pre.
elude t heir saying it.
They have no Presidential can
didate of thei own who meas
ures up to the situation, and
they do not know where to find
one. l ney nave no issue, w uy
m i urt-
not nominate Woodrow Wilson
as the Democrat are going to
do, and to give the world the
most impressive demonstration
of American unity in a great en
cis that it has ever known?
We do not mean that the Re
publican Party should shut up
shop or make itself an annex to
the Democratic Party, Tha
would be a calamity, for a party
of oDDositiou is essential to re-
publican institutions. The Re
i i
publican party could nominate
its own candidates for Vice Pres
ident. It could name its own
candidates for Senators and Rep
resentatives iu Congress, ltd own
randidates for Governors in the
various States and for all local
offices. Only the Presidency
would be excluded for the time
being from the arena of partisan
strife.
No other nation with a leader
like Woodrow Wilson would be
crazy enough in the midst of a
world cricis to change or to tol
erate any attempt to bring a-

It will alwavs remain to the

While the average American

It is Time to Awake.
Things are passing; our friends
are dropping off from us; strength
is giving way; our relish for earth
is going, and the world no longer
wears to our hearts the radiance
that it once wore. We have the
same sky above us and the same
scenes aiound us; but the fresh
ness our hearts extracted from
everything in boyhood, and the
glory that seemed to rest once
on earth and life, have laded a
way forever. Sad and gloomy
truths to the man who is going
down to the grave with his work
undone not sad to the Chris
tian but rousing, exciting, invig
orating. If it be the eleventh
hour, we have no time for fold
ing of the hands; we will work
the faster. Through the change
fulness of life: through the solemn
tolling of the bell of time, which
tells us that another, and anoth
er and another are gone before
us; through the noiseless rush of
a world which is going down with
gigantic footsteps into nothing
ness let not the Christian slack
lis hand from work for he that
oeth the will of God may defy
hell itself to quench his immor
tality. F. W. Robertson, in The
Watchman-Examiner.
