El Paso, Texas., April 29.?Two con- >
fllcting propositions developed imme- ?
dlately after the beginning in the t
Mexican customs house in Juarez late j
today of the conference to decide the a
future disposition of the American ex- e
peditionary forces in Mexico. c
They are understood temporarily to
have increased the gravity of the nego- c
tiations. t
Fresh Deports of Villa's Death. a
In addition, another factor is be- t
lieved to have been injected into the a
situation by the receipt of fresh re- c
ports that Francisco Villa is dead. *
Mexico's consul Andres Garcia said a
Col. Carlos Carrauza had telegraphed

unable to find Villa's body, but s
that be bad established beyond dis- b
pute that the bandit leader was dead E
and he hoped to recover the body in a n
few days. The telegram said all the
evidence tended to confirm the death
of Villa. b
This telegram is understood to have e
been laid before the confereeee but d
none would confirm or deny it E
Meeting Behind Closed Doors.
The initial meeting which lasted
fwo tiours was held behind closed
doors in the big. green-tinted room 111

ters. Another conference will be held 8
April 30th. in El Paso. h
Reiterate Desire for Withdrawal. c
Major General Scott and Funstou a
represented the United States. The
Mexican conferees were Gentral Alvaro
Obrgon, Mexican Minister of
War, and General Jacinto Trevino, *
military commander of the northeast
district of Mexico. The progress of
the negotiations was not divulged, but J
from an authoritative source two ?
things were learned:
First, that, the Mexican represen- 1
tatlves reiterated the wish expressed in a
General Carranza's recent note to the 15
Washington Government that the e
American troops should be withdrawn *
from Mexican soil at an early date.
Second, that they were informed by ^
the American officials that the latter *
were not empowered to discuss the
withdrawal of General Pershing's columns.
Would Bring on a Deadlock.
It is understood the American representatives
told the Mexican officials
that if the de facto Government in
siated on an American withdrawal "
that the conference would go into a 1
deadlock and the whole matter would
divert to a diplomaic discussion be- e
tween Washington and Mexico City.
Must Co-operate Against Bandits. 1
The Mexicans, it is understood, were "
further informed that the purpose of 8
the present conference so far as the e
United States is concerned is the de- 5
velopment of a specific plan for the v
co-operation of the American and de L
facto armies in wiping out the bandit c
groups that have caused so much 1
hl.uvlaho^ alnno lha hnrrtep nnH liav'A "
repeatedly taken American life in the b
interior of Mexico.
It is understood that General Obregon,
prior to the conference, openly
expressed a disinclination to discuss
any other subject than withdrawal
and that, he carried his attitude into
the initial meeting.
No Intervention Likely.
In well informed quarters, however,
the opinion was freely expressed that
to lead to any definite disagreement.
It was pointed out there that the Carranza
Government could not afford to
take any step that would endanger its
present peaceful relations with Washington.
As far as the United States '
was concerned, it was argued, it has
consistently held to a "big brother" 3
policy toward the country south of v
the Rio Grande and had repeatedlyannounced
itself against intervention. J
Joint Policing of Territory. I
This agreement, it was believed, i
would provide for a joint policing of 1
fhe bandit-Infested territory of Chi- i
huahua, with the American army sta- <
tioned some distance south of the Rio <
prgnde in position to act as buffer/<
against the repetition of bandit at- |
tacks on the border. i
While the instructions sent by Secretary
of War Baker to Generals
Scott and Funston have been zealousy
kept secret, it is know that the
following general conditions will be
insisted on by the American repre- A
esentatives:
The American Demands.
Open and effective co-operation of the j
?arranza forces with the Americans.
Extension of the American lines into
Mexico at least as far south as Casas
jrandes and probably farther.
Relegation to the American miliary
the duty of policing "a northern
:one," consisting of t'he territory diectly
south of the international bounlary.
?
Policing the remainder of the terri- t'
ory?a "Southern zone''?by Car- **
anza forces. S1
Co-operation in the handling of ^
iupplies for the American troops.
Granting of the use of the Mexican v
ai)wa>s to the expenditionary force. *
IVould Then Consent to Withdraw, oi
' >- .1 ~ ? ?< h
uu uie uooepiuuut; ujl uicsd wilu- ?
ions, it was believed, Americans "
vould agree not to penetrate farther
south than a line to be agreed on, and u
hat they could consent to withdrawal i*
ust as soon as they should receive d
idequate assurance that Villa followirs
and ot'ner bands had been eradi- 01
a ted.
The reception to the visiting Mexi- t(
sans developed into more of a mill, oi
ary demonstration than a mere social f<
iffairs. When General Obregon'B big ti
ouring car rolled off the internation- hi
il bridge was greeted by double lines u
?f American solidiers planted along ri
Santa Fe sree almoty^sboulder to ta

* drawn up by Gen. Obregon and Gen.

Formal announcement of the position

* take it for granted that Gen. Obregon
e (would not have made an agreement
e which would not have been accepted

r The agreement provides for the eod
operation of American troops and Carranza
soldiers in clearing northern
Mexico of bandits. Mexican railroads

of supplies for the American troops.
While no time limit is set for the with1

he replied. "She doss not relish the
American possession of the Phllllppln#
r_ islands. She wants the United States ^
tc stay altogether out of Asia. There
I is a strong anti-American feeling in

- That Japan bopes ultimately to be
t, powerful enough to assert an Asiatic
Monroe doctrine was the gist of Dr.
t Chew's remarks. She is not rich
f enough to do this, however, hence she
e has her eyes sat upon the resources
of China. But China must first bf
f crushed J&nd subjugated. /With the
j wealth of China in her grasp Japan
>, confidently believes that as a milIB
tary power she would have no superior
a on land or sea. It is to the interest
a therefore, of the world at large and
especially to the world at large and
e especially to the United States that
3 China be preserved and not gobbled np

r States sucessfully. Moreo?er, they
believe they can hold a part of tht
Pacific coast, he averred. There are
60,000 well trained Japanese soldiers
in the coast states. Every male Japanese
citizen la a well trained soldier.
The Japanese general staff no doubt
v have plans for the conquest of Califor*

Asked as to a possibility of a separate
peace being signed between Gard
many and Japan, Dr. Chew replied
that the British navy is the answer
and an emphatic one. When the alliance
with Great Britain has served
its purpose Japan would unhesitating;
ly break it. He believes Japan's aact
, alliance will be with Russia. Their
g interests conflict far less than the inr
terests of Great Britain and Japan.
Dr. Chew asserted that Japan has
the most effective military despotism
in the world?far more dangerous than
5 of Germany. The people are ground tQ
. abject poverty by the taxes which
. amount to 4U per cent, he declared.
r All whose incomes are in exesa ci
. $150 are forced to pay an income lax.
y He says that It is entirely possible
1 that Japan was the instigator of the
recent revolutions in China,
r The California school wegrsgatlon
and alien lands laws and the proposed
United States jlmmigrattyn bill are
thorns in Japan's pride, he believes.
