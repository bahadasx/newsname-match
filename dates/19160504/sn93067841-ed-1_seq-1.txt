Begins Today.
Only a week has elapsed since the
first announcement of The County
Record's plans to give away over f
thousand dollars in valuable prize:
l to the energetic ladies of Williams
? burg and adjoining counties, and al
F ready wonderful interest has beer
manifested in the campaign. Nonii
nations continue to come from al
quarters, and there is evidence thai
the greatest interest is being fell
wherever The County Record circu
lates.
Candidates and prospective candi
dates have brought out several point;
that need special explanation anc
answers. The most important ques
tion asked was: What do we have tc
do to win?
First: You must familiarize your
self with the conditions of the con
test. Second: See how simple th<
rules are; sign the nomination blanl
r and send it to the Contest Manager
This will bring you information tha
will explain to you in full the detail;
of the contest and start you on th<
road to success. Some few did no
understand about the weekly balloi
counting fifty votes each. A candi
date is entitled to as many vum w
she can get, but they must be vote<
on or before the date printed thereon
It is not necessary to be a subscri
ber to The County Record to be eli
gible to enter the contest. Any mar
I ried or single lady of good repub
<0F living in the territory reached b:
The County Record can enter th<
contest by filling in the nominatioi
blank or having someone do it foi
her.
, SUBSCRIPTION BOOKS NOW READY.
These books are for use in secur
ing subscriptions and can be had b:
making application to the Contes
Department. The County Recor<
desires to say to the candidates wh<
have already entered and to thos<
who contemplate entering that th<
Contest Department has been espec
ially organized for them and is pre
pared at all times to give any assist
ance consistent with the rules of th<
contest to all who apply. It is wel
to remember that an early star
I gives an advantage in a contest o:
this kind. It is aiways true that op
portunity knocks and then waits onl]
a little time for the door to open. Ii
this case the opportunity may be ii
the form of a beautiful automobil*
I or a substantial sum of money, tie
busy now and be a winner.

! MONIOUS CONVENTIONS.
1 The Williamsburg county Demo^
cratic convention met here at noon
E, *1 T_ ? 4.
MOIlUay. Ill ittl-'l, ill t-vcly wuuuy
. in the State the Democrats held a
convention on Monday, principally
* for the purpose of electing delegates
51 to the State Democratic convention,
* which will be held in Columbia on1
" Wednesday, May 17. From reports
) of the conventions given by The
News and Courier it appears that a
" spirit of harmony characterized
' practically every meeting and in
i very few were there contests of any
c consequence. The outstanding fea*
ture was the endorsement of the ad^
ministration of President Woodrow
8 Wilson in every county, some of
i which instructed their delegates to
suDport in the State convention reso^
lutions for a delegation to the Na'
tional convention instructed to vote
8 for the renomination of President
* Wilson.
In many 01 tne conventions me
* "county-to-cqunty" campaign sys"
tern wa^ not mentioned, but where
" it was discussed, in the majority of
? esses the decision was in favor of
7 retaining what has become known
- as the "biennial circus." The Flor1
ence convention passed a resolution '
r asking the State convention to permit
the people of the State to vote
in the primary this summer on the
. question of abolishing or keeping
y the present system. In many count
ties the delegates seemed indifferent
1 on this matter.
j The Williamsburg county Demo?
j cratic convention was called to or;
der by Chairman P H Stoll at 12:10
. o'clock in the court house.
Messrs P H Stoll and A C Hinds!
. were unanimously elected temporary i
? chairman and temporary secretary,,
I respectively. i
II The roll call of delegates showed
f! that 93 delegates and alternates
. were present. At the conclusion of
f | the roll call the temporary organ t
1 ization was made permanent by a
! unanimous vote of the convention,
-> I whpreunon the chairman Droceeded
t to call the roll of the county executive
committeemen chosen by the various
clubs of the county as follows:

mann; A C Hinds, E C Epps, R K
Wallace, Kingstree; D E McCutchen.

I)r I N Boyd, Salters. ^
As an expression of its apprecia- m
tion of the services of Mr A CI "
Hinds, who has been the secretary j
of the convention for a number of E
years, a resolution was unanimously j T
passed by the convention endorsing i ?
Mr Hinds as a delegate from the|P
sixth district to the National Demo- j ei
cratic convention to be held at St I &
Louis in June and the delegation I
was authorized to present his name j o
to the State convention in this con-, ?
nection. ' ti
Resolutions were passed endorsing ' ^
President Wilson and P H Stoll, So-1 M
licitor of the 3d circuit. The con- '
vention voted to continue the coun- j
ty-to-county campaign. j C
RESOLUTIONS. j ^
Whereas the President. Woodrow I ^
Wilson, is universally recognized as i j
his party's greatest leader, and that i ?
his administration has been the ful- g
fillment of the platform pledges of j q
the Baltimore convention, which p
selected him for Democracy's Stand- ft
ard Bearer, and, ft
Whereas, his leadership has ac- ?
coraplished reforms in finance and
in economics, and has revived the ^
realistic principles of the party with ^
such positive results that his name i
will be linked with that of the im- ?
mortal memory of Thomas Jeffer- n
son. and
Whereas, his policy of watchful ^
waiting has proved a master piece
of statesmanship, diverting plans of ^
war jingoes and preserving peace ^
with all the world, with dignity and ^
with honor, and v
Whereas, his ultimatum to Lrer-ij;
many is but the expression which i '
the great altruistic mission of Amer-1 r
ica demands, and
Whereas, implicit confidence is j
placed in his knowledge of world1 ^
affairs and in his ability to meet con- ^
ditions as they arise, therefore, be it j
Resolved by this Demccratic con-!
vention that his>services at this time 1
are indispensible, not only to his ^
party but to the American people of
all parties, and that the delegates to c
th<* State convention instruct its j
delegates to support him for re-! o
nomination, and him alone, should j n
the absurdity of opposition develop.
P H STOLL ENDORSED FOR SOLICITOR. |j
Whereas, the Honorable Philip H L
Stoll has announced his candidacy
for re-election to the office of Solicitor
of the third judicial circuit, and,!
Whereas, he has served the State j
with marked success since his incep- J V
tion into public life, and that his:^
ability is now recognized throughout,
the circuit and in the State at u
large, and a
Whereas, the faithful are entitled s'
to public recognition and deserve a
commendation due to honest service; K
Therefore, be it resolved by the n
Williamsburg county Democratic P
party in convention assembled, that Sl
the Honorable Philip H Stoll is hereby
endorsed for re-election to the a
office of Solicitor of the third ju- b
dicial circuit, and that his candidacy b
is presented to the Democrats of G
this circuit for their favorable con- e
sideration. e
