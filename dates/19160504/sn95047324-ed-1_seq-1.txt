Willi the starting of the
"Health Train" on its wander
ings up and down the State, Flor
ida lias taken a long step for
ward. No other commonwealth in
the entire country is better
equipped than this for the work
of educating its people to higher
ideas of sanitation and to the pre
vention of disease, according to
the most advanced scientific meth
ods and experience.
Dr. Porter's Pet Ambition
This train with its splendid e
quipment is the realization of Dr.
Joseph Y. Porter, for more than
twenty-five years the efficient and
able officer of the State Board of
Health. It provides the means
by which the board may come in
to closest touch with the people of
Florida, may bring its campaign
of practical education on health
and sanitation to the people them
selves. This campaign has been
carried on for years by correspon
dents, by periodical and special
press of the State, which always
has been most hearty and liberal
in its supoprt of the work of the
board.
During the year past represen
tatives of the board have visited
various sections and cities of the
state, carrying with them panels,
models and other equipment to
bring to the people practical in
struction for better living. The
splendid success that attended
this effort suggested its elabora
tion and extension, and the health
train is the result.
This has been accomplished
without any special appropria
tion of State funds. The initial
cost of the train and its equip
ment and its operation will add
not one cent to the burdens al
ready resting upon the taxpayers
of Florida.
Responses were Ready
rrioc to me garnering or tne
Legislature of '1915 the board
broached to the various railroad
companies operating in the State
Ihe matter of free hauling of such
a train and free passage for the
necessary representatives of the
State board and of the attendants
and servants required. From the
officers of these transportation
lines came a ready response of
willingness to furnish such serv
ice without cost to the State or
the board if it could be done with
Li the legal provisions of the sta
lute books of the state.
Next, appeal was made to the
State Railroad Commission, which
expressed the opinion that it, had
not the authority to grant such
permission to the railroad com
panies under the then existing
laws. It was considered that
special enactment by the Legisla
tuie would oe needed to give
such authority. This was adopted
by the legislature in May, 1915,
which in effect, gave the commis
sion authority to give the rail
roads permission to do ' what
they had already promised to
do, and so the complicated
problem was solved and all was
well, so far.
the ruJiman uompany was
most liberal in its bargain with
the board, by which the latter se
cured throe standard sleeping
cars for its use. These were re
modeled to meet the requirements
of the new and somewhat novel
.service, and they were brought to
Jacksonville some weeks ago. The
intervening time has been occu
pied in preparing and installing
the equipment lor the great and
important work.
The co-operation of the rail
roads of the State with this work
of the State board has been most
liberal, even enthusiastic. The a
greemcnt between the roads and
board provides that all car in
spection shall be done without
cost, and that ail minor repairs
such as replacing brasses in wheel
bearings, repairing broken draw
bars, and the like shall be made
;it actual cost. Some roads have
promised to ice the cars without
charge.
At the regular rates, such as arc
charged for the handling of the
atrical specials or parties travel
ing in private cars, the service
rendered without charge woulu
amount annually to tens ofiXhous-! Youn Citrus Trecs Nced Mulch
auds of dollars. This co-opera
tion of the railroads will be of un
told worth to the people of the
state and it is strong evidence
that even railroad managers have
souls.
By a ruling of the Interstate
Commerce Commission the train
may be handled beyond the lim
its of Florida and in any State in
the Union, without charge or at
reduced rates, whenever the
transportation companies of such
other States may be willing to
render the service free.
The Living Car
Car number one, the living car
for the accommodat ion of the rep
resentatives of the board, con
tains the office in the observation
end, four staterooms, bath and
toilets, diningroom and kitchen.
Like the other cars of the train,
it is heated with steam and light
ed with electricity generated by
a dynamo in car number 2, . and
like the others it is carefully
screened and ventilated.
Car No. 2 contains in one end
the dynamo, driven by a gasoline
engine, and the sleeping quartet's
for the special train crew. The
Dry weather is telling on the
young citrus trees which have
been set this spring. Those which
were set during February and
March and were not mulched
have made very little growth
and may die if dry weather con
tinues. On the other hand those
which were mulched are standing
the drouth and are apparently
making root growth, according
to A. P. Spencer, district nger.t
for the University of Florida Ex
tension Division.
Mr. Spencer suggests that any
trees which have not been mulch
ed be mulched immediately. Any
material, such as pine straw or
Spanish moss that will protect
the ground around the trees from
the sun, will serve. The mulch
South Florida Corn Looks Well
The corn of Hillsboro, Polk
and DcSoto counties is doing
well in spite of the continued
drouth. A. P. Spencer, district
agent for the University of Flori
da Extension Division, reports
that the drouth has been more se
vere in South Florida than in any
other part of the state. But the
cprn is growing well and has a
good color. Some of it has been
cultivated Ihe second time and a
f?w rranlon patches of sweet corn
are- in tassel.
Mr. Spencer says that the prac

AMERICANS ENCOUNTER
DIFFICULTIES IN MEXICO
Heavy Rains Make Transporta
tion of Supplies a Problem
Columbus, N. M. Heavy rains
falling over northern Chihuahua
confronted American military au
thority with a new problem in the
transportation of supplies to the
Mexican front. Operation of the
motor truck supply line was in
terrupted because of the inability
of five trains to make their way
from Colonia Dublan, 120 miles
south of the border, over the
soapy mud of the rutted loads.
The reports here said three of
the .trains are at Ascencion and
two at Dublan.
The rains, according to old res
idents, are but the beginning of
the tropical wet season, which
usually continues about two
months.
A largo detachment of infan
try which was being prepared
here to cross the border could not
march Tuesday. However, the
men have been partly equipped
land it is beli.ned thev will be
sent shortly to strengthen Gener
al Pershing's shortened line of
communication.
General Funstou believes that
American army is prepared to
meet, any eventuality.
Well-informed persons here are
inclined to place considerable
stress on Secretary Baker's use
of the word "immediate" in con
nection with withdrawal. They
interpret the assertion that there
could be no agreement reached by
the conference on the basis of an
immediate retirement as meaning
that the United States might eon-j
sider withdrawal after a reason-,
able length of time, provided J
that in the meantime the object
of the expeditionary force was
accomplished through sincere co
operation by the Mexican army
with the Americans.
It is reported by an apparently
reliable authority General Per
shing's entire army will be con
centrated at the Colonia Dubbin
bas, if an agreement is effected
calling for co-operation.

Beetle controls this insecr. The
Plant Board will supply these,
beetles through inspectors at the
cost of collection. Application
for the beetles should b mad'1 to
the office of the entomologist. Un
iversity of Florida, Gainesville.
Most growers obtain ten or a
dozen of the beetles. It is well
to confine these on a heavily in
tested branch in a mosquito net
ting for about three wcecs to
give them a chance to increase, to
protect them and to give them a
chance to become adapted to their
surroundings. The vedalias wil!
rid a grove of scales in about
three months.
After the war, the. peace of the
world ought to be made to depend

They are not ableto get back on
the tree after they reach the
ground. But it is best to use
some sort of insecticide.
Ji Jl. Watson, entomologist to
the University of Florida Experi
ment Station, recommends the
miscible oils used for whitefly, or
1 pound of whaleoil soap in four
to six gallons of water according
to the hardness of the water.
Kerosene emulsion is fairly effec
tive. Dissolve one and a half
pounds of soap in three gallons
of kerosene and mix with a pump,
then dilute to 50 gallons. A
spray that is recommended in Cal
ifornia is made by dissolving two
and a third pints of crude carbol
ic acid and two and a third
pounds of whale oil soap in hot.
water and diluting to make 50
gallons of spray.
If the first spraying does not
control of the pests another may
be given in three or tour Weeks.
County Commissioners
in Adjourned Meeting
County Commissioners met in
an adjourned meeting in Arcadia
Ihe 15th day of April. Members
present were: L. W. Whitehurst,
chnirman; D. L. Skipper, W. M.
Whittcn and W. G. Whiles.
The following affidavit was ap
proved; and the clerk instructel
to certify the same to the Comp
troller: State of Florida, County of De
Soto. On this 14th lay of April A. D
1916, before me the undersigned
authority, personally appeared
Anna E. Martin, who being by me
first duly sworn, deposes and
says :
That she is the same person de

A model dairy .is illustrated in
the same manner; the proper
feeding and clothing of babies,
the open-air treatment of tuber
culosis and many other practical
questions of sanitation and dis
ease prevention are similarly and
and graphically illustrated.
This car is also fitted with a
stereomotagraph with a capacity
of one hundred and four lantern
slides, and this is lighted and op
erated automatically by electrici
ty generated in the car itself.
The Display Car
Car number three is divided
through most of its length by a
partition, on which are displayed
thirty-six panels. These carry
in graphically worded sentences
warnings and advice on sanitary
subjects and disease prevention.
Numerous electrically operated
models and a large steromoto
graph, similar to that in car num
ber two, are also arranged to
splendid advantage in this part of
the train.
In this car will be installed an
expensive and elaborate contribu
tion from Ihe Florida Dental So
ciety, which will show various
diseases of the teeth, and the pro
per attention that should be given
them. In this car are gathered
much of the equipment that has
special significance in sanitation.
A complete inventory of the ed
ucational equipment of these cars
would be entirely unnecessary,
for the train with all its invalua
ble contents is to be brought
within the reach of every person
in Florida who can go to the near
est railroad station, and it will be
taken wherever the rails are laid
on which it may be run. It is to
be permanent, a perpetual travel
ing school, illustrating forcefully
and graphically how better health
conditions, better sanitation ane
better living may be brought to
every Floridian. When it has car
ried to every part of the State its
object lessons, the journey will be
repeated, with newer models and
the later discoveries of medical
science.
All is Free
It is absolutely free to all who
will accept what it offers what
it will bring to all; it is without
cost to those who will listen to
those who are prepared to explain
and advise to those who will read
the panels and watch the moving
pictures and lantern slides.
The train will have on board in
all its movements a physician.
representing the State Health
Board, and others who are pre
pared to give practical personal
advice to those who ask it.
The initial trip will be made in
personal charge of Dr. J. Y. Por
ter, State Health officer, and of
Miss F. D. Herndone, assistant to
the health officer.

FRENCH OFFENSIVE ON
THE FRONT OF VERDUN
Captured Five Hundred Metres
of German Trenches
London The French . Monday
night made a strong attack a
gainst German positions south
east of Fort Douaumont on the
Verdun front. The French cap
tured a first line German trench
500 meters long and took 100
prisoners, according to the
French official statement. The
French war office also announced
that in their attacks on April 29
and 30 on the north slope of Dead
Man hill the French gained Ger
man trenches over a front of
2,000 metres and for a depth of
300 to 600 metres.
The reports states thaj. the
czar s army has regained posi
tions recently lost to the Germans
north of Mlynov. On the other
hand the Austrian official state
ment tells of gains of ground by
the Austrians on the ki.'ksihii
front and the taking of some 200
Russians as prisoners in that sec
tor.
There has been a renewal ot' ac
tivity on the Austro-Italian front
in the Gonzia sector. It is most
ly confined to artillery action and
this is true of other sections of
the Austrian-Italian front.
There seems to be a lull.in the
Caucasus campaign. Since tak
