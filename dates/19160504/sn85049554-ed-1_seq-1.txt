Was^gton, May 4.—Major General
Scott's report on his conference with
General Obregon, laid before President
ItYilson today iby Secretary Baker, was
characterized by officials aa "satisfac
tory."
y,j& i* understood to provide for the

been reported, for the withdrawal of
General Pershing's forces.

northward movement of American
troops will attain full speed and it
will not be long until the last trooper
crosses over the international boundary
line.
Will K«ep on Move.
In the meantime, it was pointed out,
there will be, constant tpovements
northward of American detachments,
so that when the final order for with
drawal comes there will be only a part
of the present expeditionary force left
on Mexican soil.
Answers to the long dispatches sent
today to Washington by General Scott
and to Queretaro 'by General Obregon
were not expected to be received- here
before tomorrow. In case the terms
settled upon by General Scott and Gen
eral Obregon are approved by Presi
dent Wilson and General Carranza the
present negotiations will practically be
concluded, or the formality of another
conference will be gone through with
either tomorrow night or Saturday.
Await Formal Agreement.
It is probable that no American
troop' movements will be begun until
the formal signing of an agreement
by the governments, or at least until
General Carranza has signified his ac
ceptance of the stipulated conditions
by the Washington government.
After that, however, the Mexican
and American troops are expected to
begin at once a co-operative cam
paign that will effectively stamp out
tlje various bandit groups.
It is generally understood here that
the first step to be taken, will be a
gradual retirement northward of the
American forces while the Carranza
troops plunge into the campaign
against the Villistas.
Will Move to Guerrero.
Columns now In the neighborhood of
San Antonio will fall back first to
Guerrbro, where they will remain a
while. I*ater the Guerrero detachments
will proceed to Namiquipa. From here
regiments will be gradually detached
and transferred to Colonia Dublan un
til finally the whole force occupies a
restricted zone along the border.
It is regarded as altogether prob
able that a certain percentage of the
troops will recross the border some
time before the word comes that the
CaiTanza government has accom
plished its mission.
While the Carranza forces are
sweeping thru southern Chihuahua
and Durango, the Americans will
be looking after stray groups operat
ing to the north.
Carranza to Uae Big Force.
It is understood that G&ieral Obre
gon is pledged to throw every avail
able ounce of bis military strength
into the hunt for the various ma
rauding bands. It is believed that
almost all the 25,000 men suggested
by General Carranza as a Mexican
border patrol, 'fa case the American
government consented to withdrawal,
wlll be utilized in the campaign.

LORIMER TO REPAY
BANK'S DEPOSITORS
Declares He Will Start V.fe An*w, in

Chicago, May
4.—William
A federal indictment against Lori
mer Is still pending, but United States
Attorney Cllne said he would bake no
action in this matter until next fall.
Charges similar to those against Lori
mer, are pending against Hatry Hut
tig, a director of the defunct bank.
Lorimer's defense was that the
charge of which he was charged was
committed by C. B. Munday, first vice
^president of Che bank. Mundsy is now
serving a penitentiary term for his ac
tivities.
Mr. Lorimer today announced
would again be a candidate for the
United States senate, from which he
was ousted.
"I will re-enter politics as soon as I
have paid off depositors in the bank,"
he said. "I expect to have my flnan
city affairs cleared up within a year.'"
Chicago, May 4.—The Jury In the
Lorimer case returned a verdict of
iot guilty at 12:30 this morning-
The ju»y was out a little more than
six hours.
The jury in its verdict held that Lor
imer had no part in any violation of
the banking laws in connection with
the career of the La Salle Street bank
or of the criminal laws In the hank's
failure and that he had no knowledge
of such violations.
The verdict was the same on both
the charge of conspiracy to defraud
and that of embezzlement, the judge
having instructed the Jury that a sep
arate verdict on each charge would
have to be returned.
As the clerk read the verdict a shout
went up In the court room and there
was a rush of spectators to shabe the
hand of Lorimer as be stood smiling
in front of the judge's bench.
After the confusion had subsided
somewhat, Lorimer addressed the jury
in a trembling voice. After thanking
them he said:
"I want to say to you that in giving
me liberty the people who deposited
money in the La Salle Street bank,
.beginning with those who can least
