TEXT—Verily, verily, I suy unto you.
I,„ tint lifllrvi-th on me hath everlasting
life.—John 0:47.
The end of salvation, as the apostle 1
Peter puts it. is the saving of the soul.
Literally millions

conl ' UHPd us t0
If ’*■. y J how it is obtain- j
able. There may be
I iw*. three answers to
-V the *1 ion How
is a man to be
saved?
Saved by Prin
First, some seem
ri*™sts!s% —ll-—. saved by adopting
certain theological propositions; cer
tain religious dogmas or teachings.
The weakness of i.Km position is
quite easily seen by the majority and
they immediately say that the theory
must eventuate in practice; there must
be a program of conduct, and that |
program must he carried out in ac tual j
life.
Saved by Program.
For such a program the moral law 1
of God is put to tribute. The ethics
of wise men of Old Testament times; j
the best ethics of seekers after truth j
of the first centuries; tlie ethics of the j
Sermon on the Mount and of Jesus j
himself and his apostles, arc all put j
to tribute, and a program of life is
presented, and it it can he carried j
out. salvation will ensue perforce. This j
belief is in the face of much teaching |
of the Word of God that man's right
eousnesses are as filthy rags. Vet, ,
with all ibis, there are thousands of j
men and women today who are trust- |
ing some program of living to be their |
passport to eternal salvation. But |
sincere students of the principles and
the ethics of Jesus have found that
other teachings of Jesus take the fouu
dalion from under this program.
Unique Religion.
The religion of Jesus Christ Is
unique, being different from all other j
religions in that those who are to re
ceive its benefits are not to do so as
the result of their belief in its prin
ciples, nor an alignment of their lives
with its program of conduct. Neither
Buddha nor Confucius nor Mohammed
comes with such a claim. They give
the principles and the program, but
keep themselves in the background.
Not so with Jesus Christ, and, strange
us it may seem, his religion is in a
sense, the most egotistic of ail the
religions that the race of man has ever
received. He makes most astounding
claims for himself: lie is equal with
tile Father: he is the son of God; ho
has all power given to him in heaven
and on earth: he can raise the dead;
he can lay down his life, hut he can
take it up again; he can forgive sin;
lie is worthy to receive all honor and
worship, hotli of men and of angels;
in short, lie claims to he God. He
clearly teaches that salvation is not
in assent to, nor in belief in his prin
ciples, nor In following a program of
conduct that he gives, but in living
union with himself.
Personality of Jesus Christ.
We may note that in the text we
find that belief is referred to, but no
hint is given of principles, or a pro
gram of living. The belief here, how
ever. is not to be a mere intellectual
exercise, but a smyl movement. This
teaching is frequent: "Believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be
saved;” "He that believeth on the Son
of God Hath everlasting life;” "Come
unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden and I will give you rest.”
Now all this toadies that religion is
not a matter of principles or program,
hut of personal contact with Jesus
Christ. He is represented as the head
of the body, of which saved men are
the members. He is the chief part of
the great spiritual buildirg known as
the i hurch of God, of which his believ
ers are parts. He is the vine in which
believers are the branches. It is in
timate, personal contact all the way
through. One has very properly said:
“Much of the deadness that has come
to modern Christendom has resulted
from loose ideas of the personal ele
ment in proclaiming the gospel; in
presenting a creed instead of Christ;
in presenting a plan of salvation rather
tiian a person who saves.”
How to get this personal contact
with Jesus? Study Jesus, as he is
presented, especially In the gospels
and epistles of the New Testament, as
the Son of God. While no one can say
Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy
Spirit, yet by following the Holy Spirit
in his teaching in the Scriptures, we
may be.lieve that he will give light
upon light as man goes on honestly
and sincerely seeking to know truth at
this point.
Then let there he an utter and com
' plete surrender of the soul to Jesus
Christ. When Saul of Tarsus cried:
"What shall I do, Lord?” as he lay
prostrate on the earth by the gate of
Damascus, he made the great surren
der which brought him to personal sal
vation, but as well to the adoption of
principles that gave him a program of
conduct pleasing to God.

“GIBRALTAR OF THE BALTIC’’
Powerful Fortress of Sveaborg, Guard
ing the Gulf of Finland, Has Been
Frequently So Called.
After more than 18 months of naval
war upon the Baltic sea between the
fleets of Germany and Russia, the first
successful shot has yet to bo fired
against the mighty fortress of Svea
borg, which guards the neck of the
Gulf of Finland, and the water ap
proaches to the Russian capital, says
a bulletin issued by the National Geo
graphic society at Washington. Svea
borg, best known as the ‘‘Gibraltar of
the Baltic,” powerfully secures its
holders’ control to all the wide basin
of the Gulf of Finland, thus giving
them a most important base for dis
puting the control of the northern
inland sea. It was the acquisition of
this stronghold that constituted the
strongest impelling force In Musco
vite politics toward the conquest of
Finland from the Swedes.
Across the neck of the gulf from
Sveaborg lies Reval, the seat of other
powerful shore defenses and of Im
portant Russian navy yards. These
two points block the way from the
Baltic against any naval power al
most as securely as the forts Kilid
Bahr and Clianak Kalessi blocked the
English shins at the Dardanelles.
Reval 1s situated on a sharp bay at
the northeastern gulf shore of Es
tonia. Sveaborg fortress stands Just
before Helsingfors, the capital of Fin
land
There are hundreds of small, thick
ly wooded islands strewn over the
coastal waters around Helsingfors. It
1s upon a group of seven of such is
lands. which are larger than their
neighbors, that the almost impregna
ble Sveaborg fortress Is built. More
over. small redoubts and batteries are
well concealed in several of the out
lying islands which surround, like a
thinly-flung skirmish line, the fortress
near the coast.
Many a vain seaward attack has
shattered against Sveahorg's defenses
in bygone days, and in recent years
Russia has brought the strength of
the place up to Twentieth Century re
quirements. It is said that more than
1,000 guns are mounted here and sev
eral thousand soldiers are quartered
in the fortress even in times of peace. |
During the Crimean war the allies at
tacked this point violently and with
out success. The story goes that Eng
lish guns alone hurled more than a
thousand tons of shot and shell into
the fortress, almost without apparent
effect. It has fallen only once, and
then bribery is credited with victory
and not the force of arms. It sur- i
rendered to the Russians without an !
effort at defense, surrendering at the
same time that its garrison of C.UUU
men laid down their arms and turned
over their formidable defenses, the
whole country of Finland.
Scared by Canary.
If after spending a night In the
street of many lights, you should be
awakened by something tweeting on
your bedpost, you naturally would fear j
the worst had happened, wouldn't you? |
Someone on the tenth floor of the
Waldorf-Astoria kicked up an awful
noise during the early hours the other
morning, says the New York Times.
He summoned clerks, bellhops, por
ters and detectives to his aid. When
they reached his room they found the
sojourner cowered beneath quilts ex
pecting any minute to have a pink ele
pliant or giraffe lick his face. The
cause of his fright was a canary.
There it was, perched on the rail of
his hod, fluttering and tweeting and
enjoying its freedom. After the bell
hop had captured it, the sojourner
called for a bracer and then swore
good behavior forever afterward. Dur
ing a banquet at the hotel the other |
night some of the members in mo
ments of incongruous activity opened
a few of the cages and let the ca- |
naries flit out into the room. Since
then a canary has been appearing here j
and there in the hotel at annoying in- J
lervals and frightening sleepers.
Storage In Cato's Day.
Storage of crops against a favora- !
ble time for selling appears to be no i
new idea. We find a grain of sound |
advice in Cato's writings 2,000 years
ago:
‘‘Let your buildings be proportioned
to your estate. It is fitting that the |
farm buildings should be well con
structed, that you should have ample |
of cellars and wine vats, and a good
supply of casks, so that you can wait
for high prices, something that will
redound to your honor, your profit
and your self-respect.”
Evidently the problem of getting the
best prices was then, as now, a ques
tion of providing storage facilities, el- j
ther on the individual farm or for a ’
group of farms, such as wore included :
in most Roman estates. —Country Gen- 1

Oil Surplus Is Waste.
Ono of the causes of the lubricant
working out from the differential case t
between the axles and tubes of the
automobile to the brakes and wheels
is duo to using too largo a supply of
oil or grease in the differential case. I
It is not necessary to completely fill ;
the housing, only to a point where
the large gear will dip into the lubri
cant. If the leakage continues, fit felt
washers at the differential and wheel ;
ends of the axles.
As the wire employed for ignition
purposes Is composed of a largo num
ber of lino strands of copper, it is im
portant that they should be soldered
to a terminal or connection to avoid
the possibility of any of the strands
coming in contact with metal and
causing a abort circuit

Society in Freelands turned up Its
collective nose at little Ella l a .Monte.
The said Society consisted of the rec
tor’s lady, the doctor's lady, three or
four other ladies who had followed
their spouses to Freelands from the
East and Mrs. Andrew Germaine, the
wife of the big speculator.
To understand the cause of this in
tense antipathy one must s. an h into
the roots of humor ”■ lure. Freelands
was one of those large western towns
that are in the transition stage be
tween mining camp and metropolis. Its
population of tiiirty thousand consist
ed of cowboys, gamblers, saloonkeep
ers, ranchers, etc.. On a h..-ge assort
ment of feminine i crest in the shape
of theatrical performers a< i partners
for the cowboys at *.. i ... a. e halls.
Naturally the re 1 amt; Me element,
which was engaged in uplifting the
status of tlie town, looked askance at
tliis* state of affairs.
Hut Etta I.a Monte had the hardi
hood to lie the most attractive of the
unclassed girls in Freelands. She hud
drifted into the town from nowhere in
particular and secured a Job behind
the bar of "fig” Mahoney’s English
styio saloon. Ousted by indignant
feminine protests, she had danced

nightly at .lira Bronson's cabaret. Her
circle of admirers included not a few
of the men of the respectable element,
to the anger of their wives. For Etta
La Monte danced like a fairy, and her
voice was irresistible, whether she
sang tlie latest ragtime melody or
some old ballad calculated to raise
maudlin tears.
Her crowning insolence had boon
her appearance behind a stall at the
ladies' bazaar.
“1 don't see what's wrong with the
girl,” protested Uev. Arthur Smith, the
earnest young clergyman. "I've been
to call at her place. She supports her
widowed mother and appears perfectly
respectable in private life. She says
slie isn't allowed to work in a saloon,
and she can't do anything hut ilance."
“If you dare to speak to that crea
ture again,” replied the wife of An
drew Germaine, "you may as well give
up your church, because nobody will
go to it. You know very well that
when that wicked gambler Smith com
mitted murder last month lie hid three
days in her house before getting
away.”
“She told mo she had never set eyes
on him,” protested the young clergy
man.
“She lied, of course. All those wom
en shelter the criminal element in
those rookeries down by the yards.”
But the rising anger against Etta
was forgotten a few days later in the
first big excitement that had stirred
Freelands, for Andrew Germaine, the
big man, who held the town in the
hollow of his hand, absconded with
eight million dollars.
His gold mines, fifty miles away, on
which Freelands had lived, which
alone had justified its construction in
that arid desert, had never had gold
in them except for a few pockets here
and there. It had all been a colossal
fraud from the beginning. All the
prosperity of Freelands was built up
on Germaine's mythical gold. Every
one lost nearly everything. There was
no store, no saloon, even, but suffered
in the crash. The six hanks closed
their doors.
The anger of Freelands blazed out
white-hot against Germaine. Men
gathered in the streets and talked of
lynching. The man was reported hur
rying East, hurrying West; the police
of every western city were watching
for him. And, of ail who suffered,
none suffered more than Lucia Ger
maine, who had known nothing of her
husband's business affairs.
AH day she sat in the big house,
weeping, trying to revive her hope that
the monstrous story was a lie. But a
dozen little things told her that it was
true. Ho had deceived her, too, as he
had deceived everybody.
And yet she loved him. She loved
him better now that he was down. She
wanted only to find him, to go with
him somewhere where they could start
life anew. Etta I-a Monte, who had
been her keenest incentive to auger
in Ihe old days, was forgotten.
On the fourtli night the young cler
gyman called on her. At first she re
fused to see him. When he persisted
she came down.
‘ I am going to take you to your hus
band,” he said. “Airs. Germaine, he
himself was deceived by his associ
ates. It will ail come right. But now,
to give himself up means his death at
the hands of a mob. He is going to
the state capital at midnight on board
the express by special arrangement.
It will stop for him at the water tank.
Pack a suitcase and come.”
He led her along tlie streets remot
est from the central thoroughfares,
where she would not be recognized,
into a neighborhood where she had
never been. But she did not know
that (lie little shack they entered was
Etta l a Monte’s until l.ucia Germaine
saw and recognized the girl who stood
nervously before her. Then her anger
flamed out.
“My husband is here?" she cried.
“How dared you bring him here?”
But before the girl could answer, ttie
curtains at the hack of the room part
ed and Andrew Germaine entered. Ho
was the wreck of the former buoyant,
jaunty, pro; porous business man. at
whoso appearance all hats were lifted.
But Lucia Germaine cared nothing
for that. With a sob she ran forward
and fell into his protecting arms.
“Andrew, why did you come hero?"
she wept. “What is this woman to
you?”
Etta La Monte answered that ques
tion.
“I’ll tell you why he came here,” she
answered. "Because he didn't have
time to get away and was afraid for
his life. Because they all come to mo
when they’re in trouble, when they
don't dare to go to their own families.
He was steered to me by just about
the only man friend lie's got in the
world. And when lie knew where ho
was ho was afraid all the time 1 was
going to betray him. Weren’t you,
Andy?
"But I’ll toll you why I took him in
and sheltered him," continued Etta,
"it was because I thought he was Jim
Smith, the man who shot his pal over
a game of cards. After 1 found out
who lie was—”
"Etta!”
A keen-faced old woman stood in
the room, wrinkled and avaricious
looking.
"Now you he quiet, nia.” She turned
to l.ucia again. “After 1 knew who ho
was I pitied him and let him stay. But
do you suppose I'd have had him in
my house if I had known from the be
ginning? That’s all. You can take
him away as fast as you like”
“Etta;"
Etta l a Monte pulled tlie old woman
out of tlie room.
“Etta," site wailed, "you didn't tell
them that we’ve lost two thousand dol
lars, every cent we had, in them gold
mines.”
"All. w hat's the use, ma? He wouldn't
understand, nor pay up. neither,'
Perhaps the girl's revenge on Lucia
Germaine was worth that much to her.
For one can always dance for a liv
ing, hut one cannot always get back
one's self-esteem.
TO DECEIVE THE MUSCLES
Batsman's Regular Act Has a Signifi
cance That Perhaps All Have Not
Fully Realized.
The act of a batsman in hefting two
bats together around a few times be
fore ho takes his place at the plate
to hit at a ball with a single bat is
now considered an event of deep psy
chologVal significance. As all the
world knows, tlio reason tlie batter
does this is to make tlie single heavy
hot feel lighter, and to fool his arm
Into believing that it can make HlO
single but gambol through the at
mosphere with great speed, having
been freed of the incubus of the other
bat.
Psychology has found out that it
is actually possible to fool the mus
cles as If they were people—almost.
This is demonstrated in. the labora
tory by making the arm, say, go
through certain rhythmic movements
for a short while, and then running in
a variation on it.
For instance, a person is told to
lift and put down in succession a com
paratively heavy weight, then a light
weight, etc. Ho goes through these
motions several times, and then tlie
light weight is changed for one some
what heavier. Of course il is the same
size as all tlie others, so that tlie per
son's mind will not bo prejudiced be
forehand. When the hand goes to
lift this one it rises as spontaneously
ns with the very light weight used
before.
Ordinarily it is shown in the labora
tory that weights are lifted by the sub
ject at different rates of speed, the
heavier the slower. This takes place
unconscious+y.
Looking Ahead.
A somewhat impecunious young fol
low in Philadelphia rashly engaged
himself to a charming young tiling,
who, shortly after the excitement had
subsided, began to evince doubts. Said
she;
“How long, dearie, do you think
we shall have to he engaged?”
“Well, sweetheart, ' said the young
man cheerily, ”1 have enough money
to last for six months, I think.”

DEER WAS A FIGHTER
NOTHING “MILD-EYED” OR “TIM
ID” ABOUT THIS BUCK.
One Hunter Decidedly of the Opinion
That When Out for Venison Cau
tion Is a Quality That Is to
Be Highly Prized.
When anyone grows eloquent ovei
the "mild-eyed, timid deer,” Jim Bar
low smiles a knowing smile and shurga
his shoulders Me knows better, for
he lias lived for thirty years in the
hush and knows all about the fighting
powers and propensities of the bucks.
When his father, who, with his elder
brothers, was getting out logs, brought
him to the bush, lie was a good-sized
lad. Ho had seen a few deer shot,
hied and hung up, hut he had been in
the bush some months before he had
his own adventure. It was in the
early winter.
One day Jim heard his dog barking
furiously in the nearby swamp. He
seized his gmi and went down. The
dog had a big buck at hay, and the
buck seemed to he enjoying the sport
quite as much as the dog. The dog
tried again and again to get a grip
on the deer, but its horns were always
in the way. Again and again the deer
rushed at the dog. hut he always
dodged skillfully and snapped at the
deer's legs. It looked to Jim like a
case of endurance; but the end came
with startling swiftness. Whether the
dog weakened or was caught off his
guard Jim never knew, but, like a
streak of lightning tlio buck landed
on 'ho dog with both sharp front feet.
There was a wild scream, and the dog
lay perfectly still. The deer continued
to leap up and down and cut the dog's
body to pieces with his knifelike hoofs.
Jim put his gun tn his shoulder and
fired. Tlie buck lifted its head and
charged. Jim throw another cartridge
into the old-fashioned rifle and fired
a second shot. That brought the buck
down with a crash.
Jim drew his hunting knife and ran
to cut the deer's throat. He put his
knife on the deer's shoulder ami had
barely touched the throat with the
knife when Hie animal sprung up. Jim
went flying in'n the snow over the
buck’s head, and he lost his knife.
The deer whirled round, and as Jim
tried to get to his feet it hit him in
the hack and knocked him down. He
tried to rise again, and was knocked
over again. The deer’s sharp feet cuL
through his coat and gashed his hack.
Jim could see his rifle, but it was on
the other side of the deer. He felt
round in the snow, but could not find
his knife. He thought that he must
pet Ids gun or it would he all over
with him. Ho tried to edge away
toward the rifle, hut the deer was on
him like a flush of lightning. The
sharp hoofs struck him in the side and
knocked him unconscious. Whether
or not the deer hit him again he never
knew.
Late In the afternoon Jim’s brother
came In with a load of lumbering sup
plies. He had his own dog with him.
He drove near where Jim lay, and in
running through the. bush the dog
found the boy. Jim was unconscious
and badly frozen, and not far away the
big buck lay dead. The brother
picked Jim up, carried him to his
sleigh and hurried him to the shanty.
Jim was roused to consciousness and
told his story, hut It was some time
before ho was able to get out again.
The deer was brought In and
dressed. It weighed over two hundred
pounds. Jim got his rifle, but it was
not until the snow melted the next
spring that he again saw his hunting
knife.—Youth’s Companion.
Diet of Troops.
It is remarked in the European
armies that by reason of faulty and
defective alimentation the fighting
men show an unusual amount of dis
eases of functional impairment and
that night blindness is particularly
prevalent among the trench fighters.
Much of this functional impairment
is said to he due to the unbalanced
diet of the troops; that is, lack of
variety, and in winter to a special
lack of vegetables. The host-fed sol
dier in Europe is doubtless the Briton,
who has a ration in which there is
not only a sufficiency of meat, but
fruits and vegetables are not forgot
ten. The Munich Medical Weekly
records the fact that In the German
army night blindness Is more marked
in winter than in summer. The pa
per recommends the use of fresh fruit
juices to make good this deficiency in
the winter mouths. Citric acid lem

is an artificial product which contains
no "vltamines,” that is, has none of
the properties that contribute strength
and energy to human life.
Millions In Flax.
At the present time about 2,200,000
acres are devoted to the raising of
flax, chiefly in North Dakota, Minne
sota, South Dakota and Montana. The
flax is grown primarily for the seed
from which linseed oil is manufac
tured. The annual crop amounts to
about 20,000,000 bushels of seed and
Is valued at approximately $33,000,000.
The crop also yields approximately
1,600,000 tons of straw, but of this on
ly about 200,000 tons are put to any
profitable use.

HOW SLEUTHS MARK MONEY
Pinpricks Made in Certain Places on
Currency Gives Evidence That
Usually Convicts.
In their surveillance and apprehen
sion of suspected persona government
secret service officers often find It
necessary to “make the money’’ han
dled by such persons. There are va
rious methods of so marking the na
tional currency, one of the most novel
of which is the pinprick.
The note to be marked is, say, the
s!i silver certificate bearing the vi
gnette of an Indian chief in his full re
galia of feathers and trappings and
presenting a full-face view. With the
aid of a pin the secret service man
makes two punctures in the bill di
rectly in the pupils of the Indian’s
eyes. To the casual and sometimes
even critical inspector of the note
these pinpricks are Invisible. If raised
to the light, however, the bill will
distinctly reveal them.
The markings are complicated by
the following process: The pinpoint
is applied in the “twist’’ of the large
figure 5 at the two upper corners of
the note. These tiny twists do not ap
pear in the “necks” of the two fig
ures 5 that are at both ends of the
bottom of the note. The note Is now
pierced again, this time In the ends
of the scrolls on each side of the word
“five” in the lower center of the bill.
The marking is now complete. In se
cret it is exhibited to one or more per
sons for purposes of identification and
is then placed in the till or money
drawer to which the suspected person
hns access.
It is said that the pinpricks will re
main perfect for some time. When
such bills are produced in court and
their markings are explained under
oath, conviction is practically certain

SAMOANS IMITATE EUROPE
They Wear Civilized Clothing and
Eat Fancy Food—Native Homes
Now Made of Sawed Pine.
The natives of Samoa are exhibiting
a marked inclination to Imitate Euro
pean manners. The beautiful siapos,
hallowed by age-long usage, are dis
appearing more and more, their places
being taken by Imported cloth. Wom
en and girls like to put on greater
quantities of European wearing ap
parel.
In the vicinity of Apia native Sa
moan house and kitchen utensils have
been replaced by European articles of
less worth. Now foods are being in
troduced. instead of taro, bananas
and yams, the natives now eat rice,
biscuits and bread, and oven drink
coffee in the morning. The new foods
however have but a limited number of
consumers at present.
The native huts were formerly cov
ered with thatches of sugar cane. In
sects have destroyed the sugar-cane
plantations, and the natives now cover
their dwellings with corrugated Iron,
which gives them much less protection
against the sun during the day and
against the cpld at night. The Samo
an house is disappearing, too, and Its
place is being taken by square build
ings of American pfne.
The total native population of the
Samoan group is about 42,000. There
are 1,500 whites and half-castes.
How Rainfall Affects Crops.
The enormous value of rainfall to
the agriculturist Is set forth by E. J
Cragoe in the Journal of Geography.
He calculates that the Increase In the
wheat crop in the Dakotas, California,
Washington, Kansas and Nebraska foi
each inch of rainfall above four
inches in May and June represents a
value of about $15,000,000. The fig
ures for corn are more Impressive;
one Inch of rainfall above three Inches
in July in Indiana. Illinois, Kansas,
lowa, Ohio and Nebraska, Increases
the value of the crop by $160,000,000.
Moreover, it was found that when the
July rainfall averaged less than 3.4
Inches the yield of corn averaged ten
bushels loss to the acre than when it
was more than 4.4 inches. This rep
resents an increased value of about
$250,000,000.
Pinioned, Saved by Penknife.
Caught beneath a falling tree,

Combating Gas Fumes.
The armies of the allies are using
sponges or gauze soaked with some
solution to absorb the chlorine and
bromine gases employed by the Ger
mans in trench warfare. Ordinary
"hypo,” or sodium thiosulphate, Is
widely used for tills purpose and It
gives generally good results except
that the reaction between the hypo
and the chlorine or bromine llberatea
some hydrochloric and sulphuric add.
Prosperity for Alaska.
According to reports from Skagway,,
Alaska, shipments are being made
