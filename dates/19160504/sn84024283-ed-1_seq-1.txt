FOR SALE BY A. M. MADIGAN,
Mr. Miller on Good Roads.
Arcadia,, Mo., April 21, 1910.
Dear Editor A short time ago I
was in Piedmont, Mo., and while there
learned that the $200,000.00 bond issue
of Wayne County for the building of
crushed limestone roads, on which
they will vote on the 29th of this
month, would not increase the taxes
any. . - ; '"
Thinking if this is so, it would be a
mighty good thing for Iron County to
do the same, and I immediately wrote
to the County Clerk of Wayne Coun
ty for information on this subject and
received the following reply: .
Greenville, Mo., April 18, 1916.
Louis Miller, Jr., Arcadia, Mo.
Dear Sir In reply to yours of re
cent date inquiring as to liow we
could pay off the proposed bond issue
(or road purposes without increasing
our taxes materially, will say, that we
figure that an average rate of 30o levy
on the $100.00 valuation during the
life of the bonds will take care of the
accrued interest and retire 5 per cent.
of the bonds each year. Now we have
been paving a 25 cent rate ever
since the adoption of the Constitution
al amendment allowing us to do so
; so you see that we would only have to
raise an extra 5 cents on the 8100.00
valuation to take care of the bonds
and interest as they fall due. "
uesiqes, we have a six aouar pon
tax in this county, which
we claim '
can be cut to f 2.00 if we had good
roads; so you Bee that this would on
the whole materially decrease the taxes
is a poll tax payer. This will give you
an idea of the way we figure tnis out.
It looks at present like the bond issue
will win. v
Yours Trnly, "
Sam D. Bryar, County Clerk.
This letter speaks for itself. We
have, as I understand it, nearly the
same valuation as Wayne County, and
you all know what our road taxes are,
and 1 ask where are our roads? The
County Court is not to blame, as they
do the beBt they can, with the little
money they get hold., of. The only
way to build good permanent roads is
with a large bond issue; but not only
do we need roads but we also badly
need bridges, and how can these be
built with the funds ordinarly at the
disposal of the County Court?
St. Louis county recently voted to
issue $3,000,000.00 in bonds to build
permanent roads, Jefferson County
$500,000.00 to build roads and bridges,
Wayne will be the next to vote on
this proposition, and why not Iron
County next? If the farmers could
understand that their . farms . would
double in value, that they could pull
twice the load in half the time it takes
now, if they only had crushed lime
stone roads. I am sure a two hundred
thousand bond; issue would easily
carry in this county, especially when
it would only increase the taxes 5c
on the $100.00 valuation; why, it oould
be made back in one day for the small
property holder, not counting the de
creased poll tax.' '
A recent article in the St. Louis
Bepublio commenting on the Wayne
County bond issue, said that but for 10
miles of road in Iron County, Wayne
County would have a continuous road
to St. Louis. Now when the Wayne
County issue carries, as it surely will,
it will give one continous road to St.
- Louis from Poplar Bluff, with the ex
ception, of course, of the almost im
passable roads of Iron County, which
have no bridges, and nothing but hub
deep ruts. "' ' " .
The County Court of Jefferson Coun
ty promised the voters that the money
would be divided between the various
townships in proportion to their as
sessed valuation, and our county
court could do no less than this; also
- I feel sure they would assure" the
people that only competent engineers
would be employed to design , and
superintend the construction of the
crushed limestone roads, and that
thoy, the County Court, would be
guided only in the. building of these
roads by the expert advioe of these
engineers.. . . 1
The only way to get the good roads
. is to call a special election by petitions
to the County Court. Would like to
A ph. tj:-:-i Cnr-itr
uaed an
IRONTON, MO.
hear comments on this proposition in
t he county papers; also advice as to
the best methods to pursue, to get
this bond issue of at least $200,000.00
for Iron County.

Louis R, Miller, Jr.
High School Meet at Cape Girar

The Southeast Missouri Athletic and
Oratorical Association will hold its
eleventh annual high school meet at
Cape Girardeau on May 5 and 6.
There will be contests in athletics,
declamation, essay, debating, short

Club of Cape Girardeau and a number
of individuals and firms offer a num
ber of prizes. These consist of 86
banners, cups and medals, in addi
tion to 85 other prizes that will be
awarded, and to all winners who
break existing records additional gold
medals will be given.
' Last year about 300 students, rep
resenting 125 high schools, attended
the meet. : More than 2000 people saw
the various events, more than 1000 of
them being visitors to Cape Girardeau.
This meet will probably, be much
more largely attended. Southeast
j Missouri has the distinction of having
( the largest district high school meet

North American Mine May Re
vert to State.
(Fiederlcktown Democrat-News.)
. A considerable stir was made around
town this week when Prose
cuting Attorney Anthony served
notice on Superintendent Shuler that
unless Mr. O'Brien, the owner of the
North American property, disposed
of it before November, that the Btate
would press its claim to the property.
There is a law oh the statute books
of the state providing that no alien
can hold property obtained by then
foreclosure of a mortgage over six
years. It is under this law that Mr.
Anthony proposes to act when the
six years ahall have expired next
November' by asking ' the' Circuit
Court for a decree of title to, the' state
as the law provides.
It will be remembered that Mr.
O'Brien is a citizen of another natio n
a Canadian, and that he acquired the
property nearly six years ago by the
foreclosure of a mortgage for $150,000
which he held against the property.
There seems to be little or no doubt
about the meaning of the law. The
only question is whether or not the
owner will find a method of side
tracking. The law, however, speo:
Ideally states that the owner shall act
in good faith. " ', . . J
There are some who think that Mr,
O'Brien will now sell outright to the
Bonne Terre Company, or some other
company that has been after the
property. Others think that a" re
organization will take place and a
Missouri corporation will be formed
to continue holding the property
Whatever is done, the situation is
interesting and presents a problem in

est all over the country.

Production of Anthracite in
. 1913.
The production of anthracite in 1915,
as shown by the final figures compiled
by C. E. Lesher, of the United Stat6B
Geological Survey, from returns made
by the operators, was 79,459,876 gross
tons, differing from the estimate of
79,000,000 tons published last January
by less than one-half of 1 per cent.
The value of this output was 184,053,
498, an average of 82.32 per ton, a
value slightly higher than the aver
age in 1914. Compared with the
figures for 1914 those for 1915 ehbw a
decrease of 2 per cent in quantity and
1.9 per cent in value.
'Anthracite is used mainly as a
domestic fuel, and the mild weather
during the early months of 1915 re
sulted in a decrease in consumption.
A falling off in the exports to Canada,
which normally takes a large quantity,
and light buying by householders and
retail yards in this country during the
summer period of low prices, were al
so factors contributing to this de
crease. ;
There were 176,552 men employed
in the anthracite mines in 1915, a
greater number than in any year ex
cept 1914, when there were 179,579.
The average number of days these
men worked waB 230, as compared with
z-ia in 1H14, ana tne numoer ot tons
produced per man per year was 450,
and per man per day 1.96, as against
451 tons per year and 1.84 tons per
day in 1914. The smaller number of
days worked, together with the com
paratively large number of men em
ployed, indicate that the work during
the slack months was divided by the
companies among a greater number of
men than was necessary, m order to
assist all. As in 1014, there were few
strikes, only.30,325 men having been
mvoivea in 1910, for an average ot 7
dayB each. j-
There were IIS machines used in
underground mining of anthracite in
1915, and 57 steam shovels were used
on the surface, 1,001,431 tons having
been taken from steam-shovel pits
during the year. The steam shovels
are nearly all used in the Schuylkill
and Lehigh regions, and the mining
machines in the Wyoming region.
