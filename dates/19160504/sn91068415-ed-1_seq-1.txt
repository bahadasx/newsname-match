Noted Author in High Point-
Sidney C Tapp, of Kansas City,
Mo I was in High Point this week.
He has been to Washington present
ing his idea with the Bible to the
Secretary of War, as a means of :
Peace. He said: "This nation must
of course have navies and armies
as long as the rest of the world is
armed. But there is only one true
preparedness, and that is to educate
ftnerace in , tne sex-psycnplogy of,
! the Bible as Moses wrote it and
Jesus preached it. That within man
which makes him kill is within the
sex-nature and so is all evil. Moses
so wrote and Jesus so preached. The
Bible is a book of sex from iGene-,
sis to Revelation. Jesus overcame
thefsex-nature in mind and thought,
in the absolute, at thirty years . of
age and became the Christ and the
Prince of Peace. What Jesus did .
in the absolute, the race must be
taught to approximate, if the world
is to have Peace and solve the pro
blems of the evils of the race. We
must get back to the truth of the
Bible.lthat all evil is within the sex-
nature, if we would Christianize the
race. Mr. Tapp is a lawyer and has
written three books on the. sex-psychology
of the Bible. "The Truth
about the Bible,' "The Sexology of
the Bible," and "Why Jesus was
Man and Not a Woman-" He is a
native of Orange county, N. C, and
was educated at Wake Forest Col
lege. He has a neice, Miss Irma
Tapp who is a teacher in the High
Point High School.
Mr. Tapp went to school with E.
D." Steele of this city. He is practi
cally an invalid but has a wonderful,
mind. He is thinking of locating in .
Asheville. He left North Carolina
23 years ago for the west on account
of his health.
The three books Mr. Tapp wrote
will be offered for sale in next
week's Review and we are sure they "
are well worth a place in' every
library. He has evidently struck .
the right track. He received his .
inspiration while a . criminal lawyer. '
