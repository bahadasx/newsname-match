Big Resort Future
Dr. H. V. Pltschmann, formerly
specialist in hyJro-therapy at Bur
gess Hill sanitarium in Engand, and
extensive travel or abroad, giving spe
cial attention to watering resorts,
was a Visitor at the TldingB office
Tuesday and has the following to
say regarding Ashland and its pros
pects, based on his knowledge and
studies of European resorts:
"What wonderful opportunities and
prospects Ashland would have as a
watering resort If there was a water
cure sanitarium here. For over five
years I had charge of the hydro-therapy
treatments in the Burgess Hill
sanitarium In England and have seen
the patients grow from 63 at its in
ception to never less than 1500 dur
ing my administration. It has oc
cured to me that Ashland, with Its
lovely environment, water and clim
ate, which far excels the European
resort of which I had charge, has
unlimited possibilities.
"My experience has shown me that
people from all over the globe at
tend these resorts, especially those
afflicted with pulmonary and nervous
diseases and I am quite sure that if
these European resorts can keep up
such a large number of patients that
Ashland with her superior advan
tages, if properly handled, could be
made to become a watering and
health resort second to none in the
world."
Dr. Pltschmann is a gentleman
whose opinions cannot but carry
much Import. He has made the
curative properties of mineral waters
his study for many years and during
his visits at the great European re
sorts made a careful Investigation of
every phase of one of Europe's great
industries, that of scientific water
cure treatments.
His stay In Ashland extended over
several days, much longer than he
had Intended to stay, so great was
his Interest In Ashland's possibilities.
As have all of the widely-traveled
visitors to Ashland, Dr. Pltschmann
complmented the city upon having
'built a substantial foundation upon
which to found a great health resort
and upon leaving remarked his ex
pectations of returning some time to
find Ashland a resort city of nation
al reputation.
Week's Attractions
At Vining Theatre

Mabel Adrift" are two Triangle pic
tures, the first a strong drama, the
second Fatty Arbuckle's best comedy,

the best balanced evening's program
imaginable.
"The Corner" is the story of a big
speculator who caused widespread
misery by a monopoly in food prod
ucts and the retribution that followed
at the hands of one of his victims.
Wlllard Mack, George Fawcett and
Clara Williams are starred In this

world-renowned drama, "Jim the
Penman," the heart-gripping story of
the great forger who sins for love
and whose after life is one of remorse

heart's blood, his own punishment.

Transformation of
A Year Amazes
S. E. Batters, assistant general pas
senger agent of the Southern Pacific,
was In Ashland yesterday for his first
visit since about a year and a half
ago, when the springs project was In
Its stages of conception. Mr. Batters
with his wife and Messrs. Burnbow,
Interstate commerce attorney, and
McDonald, efficiency engineer for the
Southern Pacific, spent yesterday af
ternoon going over Lithla Park. Mr.
Batters said: "You have accom
plished a wonderful transformation
! here You have accomplished all that
you had set out to do upon the'occa
slon of my last visit, and more too."
All of the members of the party gave
vent to their approval, with exclama
tion after exclamation of surprise and
unstinted words of praise. Mr. Bat
ters has headquarters at San Fran
cisco and his activities extend over1
the vast tourist country of the south
west, Including the pleasure resorts
of southern California. When he
states that Ashland has resort attrac
tions which In their uniqueness ex
cell the California resorts, it means a
great deal for Ashland.

Ashland Band
Needs Your Support
The Ashland band has been work
ing faithfully through the winter and
spring in preparation for furnishing
concerts in Ashland park during the
summer time. Director Carl Love
land, who directs the men's band and
is also developing thirty-five ambi
tious lads of the city into a boys'
band, has been receiving $50 a
month, $25 of which was paid by the
city council and $25 from the band
treasury. The band men are now ne
gotiating the purchase of uniforms,
which will require what money is left
in their band account and consider
ably more as well. For the summer
concerts It will be necessary to pay
something to two or three new men
who will be needed, and music and
other expenses count up fast.
The financing of the band was
brought up at Monday's Commercial
Club meeting by O. F. Carson, who
explained the status and needs of the
band. A committee was appointed
from the club, who will canvass the
town, making the promise of at least
one concert a week and asking sub
scriptions to be paid each month that
the band lives up to its promises.
Any amount from 25 cents a month
up will be welcome, and it is hoped
that the citizens of the city as a
whole will show their appreciation of
the work -which the band, men are
donating for the city's welfare and
the citizens' enjoyment by subscrib
ing liberally. !

Hotel Oregon Opening and
Banquet To Be Gala Event
Arrangements are complete for the
opening of the Hotel Oregon banquet
on Tuesday evening, May 9, at 7.30.
Elaborate preparations have been
made for the affair and it should be
one long to be remembered In Ash
land. Only a limited number can be
accommodated, and reservations are
coming in to the secretary of the
Commercial Club Indicating that the
limit will be reached. A committee
will have charge of the sale of tick
ets, which will be placed at $1, but
it will not be possible for them to
reach all of those who will no doubt
want to attend, and as many reserva
tions should be made from the secre
tary as possible. This can be done
Blow Up Safe
At Central Point
What are believed by the authori
ties to be the same bunch of safe
crackers who blew up the safe in the
Ashland Fruit and Produce Associa
tion office last Sunday dynamited the
safe in R. H. Paxson's drug store at
Central Point about 3 o'clock Wed
nesday morning, smashing several
windows and scattering pieces of safe
all over the store. A little money
and a quantity of watches and- Jew
elry belonging to Runyan, the jewel
er, were taken. The stolen goods
and the damage to the store is esti
mated at close to $2,000. The work
in the Central Point and Ashland rob
beries was similar and everything
points toward the conclusion that the
same gang did both Jobs.

request that the city at large as rep
resented by the council assist in the
financing. Councilman Lamb ex
pressed himself as surprised that the
committee did not ask for more. Sev-
eral of the councilmen spoke favor
ably to the donation, the main objec
tion arising being the question of le
gality of the appropriation of the
amount for the purpose. Finally the
matter was referred to the city attor
ney, and the council will meet in ad
journed session tonight to act upon
his recommendation. The celebration
committee has been unable to see
many whom they feel would be wll
ling to help put on a big celebration
and would most certainly appreciate
subscriptions turned In at the First
National Bank.
That the fund for the celebration
should 1)e raised pro rata by the citl
zens instead of being subscribed by
the few merchants was the opinion of
several of the councilmen, and the
opinion expressed that in donating
$500 toward the celebration fund the
council would be carrying out the

Will Investigate
Skating Floors
As a preliminary move toward in
vestigatlon of the possibility and ad-
visabillty of constructing a public
skating rink or floor for the children,
Mayor Johnson appointed a commit
tee consisting of Councilmen Ninln
ger, Lamb and Cornelius, at Tuesday
evening's council meeting. This com
mittee will Investigate probable cost
and confer with the school board In
an endeavor to secure their co-opera
tion in the construction of such a
floor or floors. Various materials
will be considered and a thorough in
vestigatlon made of the feasibility of
such a feature. The recent passage
of an ordinance prohibiting skating
on the sidewalks led to the council's
action in the matter.
Minor Matters
Of Council Meet
Tuesday evening's council meeting
developed nq clashes or vaudeville,
and the . big crowd which was not
there did not miss anything. Only
a few citizens were present.
Besides matters reported elsewhere,
the following actions were taken:
The committee which has been ne
gotiating with Mr. Billings for the
piece of land on Park avenue, upon
which his barn stands, reported a
proposition which was not favorably
received, and were discharged and the
matter was laid on the table.
The petition of S. A. Hawks, who
lives Just outside the city limits, for
water from the city mains was turned
down, the city fathers suggesting that
hereafter when residents just outside
the city limits wished water they take
the necessary moves to have their
property brought into the city limits.
It seems that bringing even a little
farm Into the city costs a big amount
for election expense, as a separate
election has to be held on the land
which is to be brought in.
S. Clute was awarded the contract
for the construction of 195 square
feet of sidewalk on C street near
Third, his bid being 10 cents per foot
and totalling a dollar less than the
next highest bidder.
The electric light committee of the
council reported that they were ex
perimenting with the lighting appli
ances for the lighting of Llthla Park
and were granted more time for their
work.
A motion passed authorizing the
advertisements for bids for the re
moval of the Kinney barn from the
newly acquired property on the west
sido of Park avenue, to property on
Water street.
The resolution creating the new
sewer district In the northern part of
the city was passed.
In order to act upon the city at
torney's advice In regard to the city's
appropriation for the celebration In
July, the council adjourned to meet
Thursday evening.
Foresight Saves
City Goodly Sum
The purchase of a carload of pipe
by the water department some two
months ago saved the city several
hundred dollars. The carload of pipe
which has arrived cost the city a
fraction over 27 cents a foot, or a
total of $2,174.62. Had its purchase
been deferred a month it would have
cost over 33 cents a .toot owing to a
raJse resulting fraK-jMsr conditions.

Indian Hiker Has
Handsome Scalplock
"Its a long way to Tippeiary yet,"
quoth White Eagle, three-quarter
breed Comanche Indian, who passed
through Ashland Tuesday on a walk
ing tour of the United States which
will eventually take him 12,000
miles around the border.
With long black hair streaming
over his shoulders, White Eagle is
possessed of a scalp lock which would
have been greatly prized In days prior
to the coming of the white man. A
string of beads, varl-colored trap
pings, and other typically Indian or
naments, added to his picturesque ap
pearance. White Eagle says he Is walking
for a $10,000 wager In competition
with a white man aged 56 and a boy
of 18, whom he has not heard of
since leaving them in Montana. He
started out from Chicago and will
end up In that city after completing
the circuit of the Btates.
"Eleven pair of shoes went to the
happy hunting ground in Portland,"
said the traveler, and the twelfth pair
Is on the way. The Indian makes
his way by giving war dances and
"accepts anything anybody wants to
give him, but cannot ask help."
Pioneer Ashland
Educator Dead
Rev. Joseph Henry Skldmgre,
founder and long the head of the old
Ashland Academy, the first school of
above grade class In Ashland, beloved
of all the "old-timers" In Ashland,
passed away Tuesday morning at the
home of "his son, N. G. Skldmore, at
Image, Wash. Rev. Skldmore guided
the search for knowledge of a great
many prominent citizens of Ashland,
among his former students being E.
J. Farlow and wife, Mrs. G. F. Bil
lings, Gwyn Butler and wife, Robert
and Leander Nell, C. B. Watson and
wife, and many others. He was an
early pioneer of Ashland. Just as an
instance of how far back his residence
extended is the fact that he per
formed Judge C. B. Watson's mar
riage ceremony.
Runaway Team
Crashes Into Auto
Presence of mind saved G. N. Kra
mer, his wife and little son from pos
sibly serious Injury Monday evening
when his car was smashed by a
heavy team of frightened horses. The
team, which was driven by a man by
the name of Smith, was hitched to a
wagon used for hauling gravel. The
driver got out to fix the sent and
the team became frightened at some
thing and ran away, down Ilargadlne
street and turning Into Bench avenue.
Mr. Kramer had Just turned the cor
ner from Grcshnm street Into Bench
avenue, where the latter Is far too
narrow for two vehicles to pass, be
ing In fact barely wide enough for
one. The occupants of the car saw
the heavy team plunging down the
hill toward them and only about
twenty-five yards away. Mr. Kramer
threw his little son from the car and
with his wife scrambled to a place of
safety just as the team hit the auto.
The horses went one on each side,
the wagon tongue hitting the car
head on. The force of the Impact
carried horses, wagon and car
through a fence and onto Mr. Hardy's
lawn. The horses were practically
unhurt, the wagon broken up some
and the front end of the car badly
damaged, radiator smashed, steering
wheel broken and other damagts.
Teddy Provost has accepted a posi
tion with the depot painting gang of
the Southern Pacific Company for
this territory and reported for work
at Stelnman Monday morning. ' He
will cover territory between Ashland,

Business Men's
Luncheon at Oregon
An effort Is being made to form a
Business Men's Luncheon Club, and
to that end tickets are offered for
$2.10, which entitle the holder toi
six week-day luncheons at the New
Oregon Hotel. On the reverse side
of the ticket is printed: "Now that
we have a creditable hotel, let us)
show our appreciation by patronizing
it and at the same time help our
selves by 'getting together' occasion-
ally." Ashland Is, we think, to be
congratulated on being essentially a
"home town," and there is probably
not a subscriber to this club but
would prefer to take his luncheon at
home, but It is to the Interest of all
of us to give reasonable encourage-,
ment and assistance In making the
hotel a success and, too, an exchange
of Ideas and the social Intercourse
across the luncheon table should stim
ulate and encourage that sentiment
which makes for civic betterment and
Individual success as well. This club
Is not restricted In Its membership
and all are cordially invited to Join.
Tickets may be had of Mr. Norrls of
the Commercial Club or of Mr. Dob
bins at the hotel. This club Idea
originated with the business men and
the hotel has nothing to do with it
other than providing the luncheons.
The following citizens and business
men have subscribed, and it is hoped
that the membership may be In
creased to at least forty: G. F. Bil

COMMITTEE.
Commercial Club
Has live Meeting
As a result of a well-attended and
enthusiastic meeting of the Commer
cial Club last Monday evening the
organization has taken a new lease on
life and a new spirit promises to en
large the scope of the club's effect
iveness. Throughout the evening's
discussion and business the fact that
the club during the past few months
had a number of important accom
plishments to Its credit, and was now
engaged In gaining other accomplish
ments, became evident in such a man
ner as to remove any doubt of the
necessity of the club to Ashland's wel
fare. Much discussion was indulged
In with the Idea of enlarging the
membership and strengthening It so
as to make the club an even greater
factor for the advancement of Ash
land. One of the most Important accom
plishments of the meeting was the
appointing of a committee of ten, a
motion having been presented by F.
E. Watson proposing the same, for
the purpose of investigating several
different plans for making the Com
mercial Club a more efficient organ
ization and getting more people Inter
ested In the same. There was much
discussion on this matter and It was)
shown very forcibly that the Commer
cial Club Is nn essential factor In the
welfare of the city and should b
made stronger and more efficient.
Adjournment was taken to Monday
evening. May 15. nt which time tho
eommltteo of ten will make their re
port and the club will take action on
tho same.
Owing to the plans for the reor
ganization of the club or at least the
llnlilllty of such plans being formu
lated, the election of officers was
postponed until the June meeting.
Extensive discussion of the matter
of reorganization drew out remarks
from several members and the meet
ing on May 15 promises to be an Im
portant one.
The trade-at-home committee and
the hotel committee made their final
reports and were discharged as hav
ing fulfilled their duties with perfect
satisfaction. The Commercial Club
through this committee deserves a
great deal of credit In securing the
New Hotel Oregon for Ashland, and
goes to show that the club can accom
plish things when the proper spirit
Is shown and an enterprise given the
proper backing.
The Fourth of Jnly committee re
ported progress. .....
