EVANGELIST
STILLSPEAKS
In tho study on the spirit of pro
phecy, Evangelist M. A. Holllster
pointed out a number of Interesting
features, such as tho 'fact that it is
the words of Jesus to his servants,
Iter. 19:10, Rev. 1:1, and that those
words are from God. Rev. 1;1 and
John 3:34. In Noh. 9:20-30; 2. Chron.
15:1-3, and 20:20, wo learn that tho
, prophet of God 'will always teach
obedience to the law of God. Then
I tho speaker said that' the gift was
necessnry in order to provo tho au
thenticity of tho Bible and referred
to Isa. 7:14, Matt. 1:18-23, Dan. 8
' and 9; the prophecy of tho 2300 days.
Isa. 44:28, und 4G:l-0, Luke 21:44, ns
n few instances of the uso of the
gift. The way tho gift came Into tho
church tho speaker Raid was by God
placing It there, and by tho spirit
himself not by any man power, and
read in support of this statement,
1 Cor. 12:3-11, and 2S, and Eph. 4:11
14, 1 Pet, 1:21. then to provo the
gift should be in tho last church, he
read Rev. 12:17, 1 Cor, 1:4-7 hero It
Is pointed out that tho dovll Is par
ticularly mad at tho remnant church
because they keep tho command
ments of God and have tho testi
mony of Jesus, according to Rov.
19:10, the testimony of Jesus, is tho
spirit of prophecy, hence we can seo
why the devil Is mad, for the proph
et of God teaches the remnant
church to oboy tho commandment of
God, all ten of them, not 8, or 9 but
10, and that makes tho devil mud.
In order that wo should not bo de
ceived by a falso prophet, the Lord
gavo somo tests found in 1 Jml 4:
1-3, Isa. 8:20, Dcut. 13:1-E, 1 Cor.
14 37, in thoso wo learn again that
the law plays a very Important part
for wo nro to uso it In testing tho
prophet and any one who does not
keep tho law himself and teach it
obedlenco to falBO, and 1bo ho must
fit certain requirements while I "vi
sion, viz.: loseH his BtrengUi, will
' not broatho, sees nn angel, tho angel
Mil touch him, ho will bo strength
ened, and then talk, Dan, 10:17-18
and according to Num. 24:2-4 will
hao his eyes open also. A. W'M
prophet may meet somo of theso re
quirements, but not all; whllo tho
true prophet will meet every 'ono,
nd at a tlmo when tho tests mar,
be mado.

When tho Amalgamated Sugar H
