WHAT SHAW SAID
NKW YORK, May «.-■ QesTga

following coiuniciit on the liish

"Silly, ignori nt, wromg-hsaded,

SOAKED
IN OIL;
TANKED
C. J. Williuins, known every
where on tlio waterfront as
"Hlaikle," has one of the most
unusual jobs of any man in Tu
i onia.
But It didn't save liim from
being locked up lust night ou a
charge of carrying too big a load
of grain alcohol, and it didn't
serve as sufficient excuse to get
him out of Jail today.
Listen to the idea that he put
up to I'oliie ('apt. Head this
morning:
"(',»{ .am, I waiita get out of
jail, i|iiick. I wasn't very drunk
lust Bight—not more limn usual,'
.•inyway. I've got one of the hard-1
est jobs you ever saw. I have to
drink one uart of alcohol a day
to hold it. I'm partially drunk
all the time.
"You see, when steamers come
into port, it's my job to dive down
into the tanks of coeoanut oil in
•he hold and release the valves
so the oil will run out. They
have to heat the oil sometimes, to
make it run.
"I couldn't handle the job
if 1 wasn't partially drunk.
Why. Captain, when I try to
take a bath. 1 float right on
top of the water In Hie bath
tub, because there's so much
oil in uij skin.
"There's a ship coming In to
night, and I have to do the div
ing act In the tank of oil. 1 was
on my way to get a quart of al
cohol last night, so s to be drunk
enough to handle the job, when
the officer pinched me. Won't
you let me out so 1 can go to
work?".
The police say that Williams'
story Is virtually true.

On the Rocky Road to--What?
Benson, Socialist Candidate,
Muckraker, Not An Organizer
BY WALTER LIPPMANN.
Nobody thinks of unking
what w&f) nf president Allan
lienson would make.
In the real sense of the
word he is not a candidate
for I lie presidency.
He Is a caniliilate for two
million voles.
I If lie polls that iniiiiy lie
will be regarded ns an nver
w 11. lii ling I \ successful nonii
ec.
In selecting Iti.it the so
cialists also decided Hie issue
on which he Is to fight.
lienson is the one consist
ent, out and out spokesman
of iiiiH-preparedness. There
Is no other.
Bryan hates preparedness,
bill ho will hedge ami evade,
will talk about a million men
springing to arms between
sunrise and sunset, lienson
won't hedge. 11' lie is against
something;, lie is bitterly and
definitely against It.
The socialists this year intend
to fight a campaign of obstruc
tion. They are on the defensive.
Csually it is the other way
around. Csually it is the social
ists who are for something with
the other parties opposing or
ignoring them. Hut in this cam
paign the tables are turned, and
the chief emphasis of the social
ists will be to prevent preparded
ness.
For that particular job Allan

lienson is an admirable man. He
is by temperament an opponent.
lie is twice as sure of what he
does not want as he is of what he
does.
He's a Muckraker.
He was trained in the school of
the muck rakers. This means
that he will see the preparedness
agitation as a sinister conspiracy
of special interest playing on the
panic and gullibility of the Amer
ican people. He will point ills
finger at the munition makers,
the bankers, the exporters, the
army and navy groups, the edi
tors, the defense leagues and the
rest who are more or less in
volved financially In an increase
of armaments.
And to the question of whether
In the kind of world we live in,
armaments aren't needed even
though special interests profit by
them, he will reply that he is for
socialism which would create a
world In which the whole deadly
business could be eliminated.
Benson Scorns Details.
The steps by which such a
world is to be created do not ab
sorb much of his interest. He
works on the theory that If 'the
people could only be made to real
ize how they are exploited, de
ceived, and led by the nose, they
would have no particular troubles
In carrying socialism Into effect.
1 was once on a committee with
Benson which was trying to draft
civic bureau, will preside.
The public Is invited.
Members of the Non-partisan
league declared today that they
were by no means disappointed
by the refusal of the democratic
state convention to take a stand
for or against non-partisanship.
".We are just as glad that the
non-partisan principle is being
kept outside of party polities, was
the statement of C. K. Muckler,
chairman of the Pierce County
league. "It has been our purpose
from the first not to make It a
party Issue.
"If the democratic party cannot
see the handwriting ou the wall,
It is not up to the Non-partisan
league to act aa trustee for that
party. It is their affair entirely.
"The purpose of the Non-parti
san league Is to obtain the elec
tion of representatives. Ignoring
party lines, who will pass the
legislation demanded by the peo
ple of the state."

a bill for the socialization of the
railroads. The Intricate ques
tions of law, finance and adminis
tration bored and irritated him.
He would sit silent for long
stretches of time, nnd then burst
out with some story of graft and
swindle. He is a wonderful and
passionate hater of evil, a man
who has never grown callous or
complacent about poverty and
corruption. His hatred is so con
suming that little patience is left
for the drudgery of radicalism.
Not An Organizer.
Since he is not a candidate for
office this twist does not matter
much. Hut there is one aspect
of Ills job as socialist leader
where it will matter enormously.
His real business is to organise
the working class nnd the exploit
ed farmers for powerful economic
and political action. For that
there la needed a great organlsor
and a master of tactics. lienson
isn't In the least that sort of man.
Henson is a middle class tonga-1
zlne writer, neither a labor leader
not a politician. He is n good
speaker and a thrilling writer.
Hut he is not an organiser," nego
tiator, diplomat, he Is not the raaa
who can go Into the labor wo HO
unify its conflicts, destroy hfi
false leaders, and form it rtitb'o
political power.

He will excite and n'mUae-Jm

of people who follow Bryaif oif I.a
Follette, but for the business of
making a political force out of
the working class, Benson'is not
only certain to fail, be is not even
likely to try.
His mind does not run to non
crete political action. It runs to
magazine articles. It runs to ex
posure, satire, scorn. 1 can Imag
