"The Burdens of the Ministry" was
the subject of an earnest and elo
quent ermon by the. pastor, Rev.".
J.. Craig, preaching from the second
sermon of Christ after his resurrec
tion, as recorded in Luke 24:36-48.
Bro. Craig said that the minister's
burden is two-fold to preach, and
man's sin. He also stated, that a
minister should be a man of God, a
man of thought, a manly man, a lover
of Jesus, a patriot, and a man of sym
pathy. We are sure if all young men
could bear such an able exposition of
the noble call of the , ministry there
would not be such a dearth of spirit
filled men of God.

Just a little bit of fancy;
Just a dream of childish play,
And a memory all golden
Steals Into my heart today.
Thrilling joy, ecstatic rapture
See, my garden is In flower,
And I lose myself in wonder,
For we have the Story Hour.
Childish sorrows are forgotten;
Every care has flown away,
And my soul is rapt enchanted
In this magic Land of Play.
Blissful realm of childish fancy,
Full beauty, charm, and power.
Often thou hast made ' me happy,
When wef have the Story Hour.

The scarcity of Marines in the

About sixty per cent of the U. S. ;
Marines are in. service aboard ship

2,000 are available for navy yard du-"
ty in the United States.
' Because of the attractiveness of its
service the Marine Corps has little
difficulty in procuring recruits, and
its ranks are keps filled to overflow
ing nearly all the time, but the au
thorized strength of the ' Corps is
only '340 officers ' and 9,921 men.
Congress has been asked to Increase
this number by 3,000 men and fa
