LETTER TO A GERMAN.
'I Am Straight United States,"
the Colonel Says Every
American Should Be.
"I am not seeking the nomination,"
declared Col. Roosevelt to-day, and to
prove It ho made public a letter Just
written to an unknown German-American
correspondent, F. H. Schwan,
of Cloveland.
Tha text of the letter wns as fol
lows;
'You say you want Irishmen and
Germans to vote for me. If I ran I
should want ALL Americans to vote
for me, and I don't earn whether they ,
were born In Ireland or In Germany,
or In England or In France, or
whether their ancestors camo over In
the Mayflower. But I emphatically
would not want any human being to
vote for mo as an Irishman, or ns a
German, or ns a Frenchman or an an
Englishman, any moro than I would
want him to vote for mo as a Jew or a
Catholic or a Protestant. I am
straight United States and nothing
else; and that Is nil any man ought
to be In this country.
'I welcomo tho support of every good
American, no matter where he was
born, if he Is a good American; but I
do not want his support If ho Is voting
as a foreigner In this land of ours.
Moreover, you say that 'I had better
modify or qualify what I wrote about
Belgium' and sny something 'moro or
less favorable to tho German side,' My
dear sir, I won't modify, or qualify, in
tho smallest degreo anything I have
said during tlieso eighteen months
upon our duties, und upon tho attitude
that this country ought to take. Turn
to what I have written in tho book
called 'Fenr God and Tnko Your Own
Part' and you will llnd tho position
that I took, and on which I stnnd.
"I am not seeking tho nomination
and I tell you, with all sincerity, that
I nm not In tho least interested In
my own personal fortunes. But I nm
vitally interested In tho welfare of the
United States and In American honor
and national interest, and I am abso
lutely certain that this Is the posi
tion that a self-respecting American
ought to take."
Tho Colonel came to New Yotk
to-day from Oyster Bay to have his
husky vocal coids treated by two
throat specialists and to spend a busy
afternoon at tho Metropolitan Maga
zine, meeting politicians and planning
how to got the nomination that "I nm
not seeking." Among his callers
were the following: Lemuel lily
Qulgg, James J. F. Archibald, Victor
Iluerta. son of tho late Gen. Victor
iano Iluerta of Mexico, James It, Gar

Bootevelt Cabinet, and Hamilton
