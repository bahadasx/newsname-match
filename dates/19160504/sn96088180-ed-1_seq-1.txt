Placing Mill and Purchasing
Company to Handle Grades
of Lumber Cut by Hills in
District Is Established
Oraata Paw It no mora than
through celebrating the advent of
on new industry till the coming of
.another I announced. Last week It
was the 60.000-cepaclty Mwmlll be
ing moTed over from Jackaon county,
even carloads of the machinery now
being oik the ground. Today It la a
tig planing mill and lumber pur
chasing agency that la to be estab
lished on the line ot the new railroad
In South Oranti Pass.
H. J. . 8avldge, representing the
Frank P. Doe Lumber company of
8an Francisco, returned from a trip
to the southern city last night,' and
now makea the announcement that
all arrangements have teen perfect
ed for the bringing of the new In
dustry. A site of seven acres on the
line of the new railroad has been
leased for a period of five yean, with
option of purchase. This site Is the
tract of ground lying at the turn of
the Paclfiejjlghwsy, jj th.e ,soath
""" aide" 'of thiTrallroad track and op-
poelte the Edgerton sawmill. A sid
ing Is to be built from the railroad
onto the property, and a planing mill
of from 10,000 to 60,000 dally capa
city will he erected. Mr. Bavldge
ays that the machinery for the
planer wljl arrive here within the
next SO days.
The new company, which already
baa plants of the same character In
other lumbering districts, takes the
better grades of lumber from neigh
boring mills, puts If through the
planer, and ships the dressed lumber
to the markets of the cast. The Doe
company contracts with the mills for
lumber of No. 2 shop", and better
grades, thus making a constant and
cash market for all lumber of that
kind. Aa fast as the mills cut It, the
lumber la sent to .the Doe yards, and
-the mill owner Is relieved from the
search for a market or from having
bis capital tied up In lumber In bis
own yards. Through their different
agencies the Doe people are In touch
with all the available markets, and
-can thus place the lumber to much
better advantage than could the In-
, dividual mill men.
Mr. Bavldge states that the new
aiding will be built at once and the
new industry -will be in tull swing
. ' within a short time. The only build
ing to be constructed at this time
will be the planing mill. He says
that he has already enured Into
Agreement with the mills of the
"fiohmttt Bros., of Harry Smith and ot

Washington. May 4. On tbe eve
of the reception of Germaoy's note
replying to President Wilson's sub
marine demands, Washington offi
cials wavered between optimism and
pessimism today. At first they were
hopeful. Letter, following the clear

the reply, they were not so optimistic
Fear was expressed, tbat there
would be so many stipulations In tbe
kaiser's message that the adminis
tration would be unable to accept It.
One thing la clear. If tbe note
does not meet the demands In full,
without irrelevant conditions and
quibbling stipulations, President Wil
son will regard It aa unsatisfactory,
and aa final, and his action will be
prompt. It waa stated on the highest
authority.

H REPLY HANDED
tO AMBASSADOR GERARD
Answer to the American Dennd That the Teutczc Nation
Cease Its Submarine Warfare on Elcrcbtnisen Was
Completed and Delivered to the United States Repre
sentative at Eerlia Late This ,
Uerlln, May 4. The German reply
to the American submarine demands
was heeded to AmtMuwador Gerard
this afternoon.
Foreign Minister von Jagvw hand
ed the German reply to Gerard, at
8:40 p. ui. Gerard received the note
at the foreign office. He then went
to the embassy, w here the work of
coding it was begun. Clerka expect
to work late on the note before it la
asbled.
With the delivery of the note, the
foreign office announced that the text
would be made public early Friday.
Waahlngton, May 4. The uncer
tainty aa to tbe time when the Ger
man reply to American submarine de
mands will be despatched to Wash
ington, raised new doubts here to
day as to tbe document's contents.
Either direct compliance with
President Wilson's wishes or evasion
of the issue is expected.
By tbe latter Is meant temporis
ing and raising negotiable Issue while
Indicating tbat the objectionable sub
marine methods have actually bees
stopped for the present.
The time taken In framing the
reply aroused a belief among officials
here that a temporising message
would be most likely. Others think
that the efforts to frsme a reply di
rectly complying with the demands,
but not arousing too much feeling In
Germany, la the explanation of the
delay.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing conferred last night. If the
German reply falls to squarely meet
the administration's demands. It will
be deemed unsatisfactory. It was
stated that the president had not
wavered In his determination that
Germany must acquiesce completely.
German officialdom here said that
If Germany agrees on the question of
principle. It only remains to deter
mine the "method" of warfare, which
the governments can agree on.

emphatically, I would not want any
human being to vote for me as an
