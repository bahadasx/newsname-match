Large, page three hundred and

Act of March first, nineteen hund

utes at Large, page ten hundred
and thirty-four)."
No Exception To The
Rule.
Thomas Bishop, president of
the Northwestern Federation of
American Indians, an organiza
tion which includes all the Indians
in the State of Washington, and
aKo Alaska, has written a pamph
let entitled "An Appeal to the
Government" in which he asks for
the fulfillment of the treaty stipu
lations made with his tribe, the
S'Kallam Indians of Washington
State.
In his introductory Mr. Bishop
says: "In drawing the attention
of the government of the United
States to the sufferings of some of
its wards, the Indians, because of
tho non-fulfillment of the promises
ide to them by the government
so long since, and which for some
reason do not appear any nearer
being met than thej? were 6*1 yea^s,
ago, we do not speak in anger, or
even in ridicule, but in truth, in
order to bring to notice an exist
ing condition which, possibly, is
not known or has been overlooked
by the government, and for the
purpose or righting a wrong
which, if allowed to go on, will
cause more hardship and death to
thp original native American peo
ple than it has already accom
plished.
In the almost compulsory trad
irg of lands owned by the redthis
men for the government's word to
give them other lands and to seelaw
that they lacked for nothing in
privileges and desires, and thethe
non fulfillment of any of these
promises, causing misery and even
death to many signers of the
treaty, is pathetic to say the least
The contents of this pamphlet
are true in every respect and will
enlighten the officers of the gov
ernment as to the condition of
things pertaining to the most un
red men."
Mr. Bishop then proceeds to
quote treaties and states in what
respect they have been unfulfilled,
and he complains very bitterly be
cause the Indians who live on
Puget Sound are not permitted by
the State of Washington to kill a
certain species of "fish ducks"
that are not classed as game birds
and are never eaten by the whites,
but which are the only kind that
the Indians will eat, and says this
is a privilege provided by treaty.
Mr. Bishop's complaint is the
same old story of all the different
tribes of American Indians, treat
les that were made only to be
broken by the United States
whose officers placed a technical
construction on every sentence.
In making treaties with the
United States Indian tribes only
relied upon the statements that
were made to them by repreaenta
tixes of the government, state
ments that almost invariably were
misconstrued by the officials of
the Interior Department within a
year after the tieaties were made.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
have had ample experience in this
re?.pect even under an agreement
made as late as 1889 when unusual
care was taken by some of the ed
ucated members of the tribe to
protect tribal interests.
As an illustration, we have only
to refer to the Mille Lac case in
which the strong resistance by
attorneys of the Department of
Justice has been overcome in the
courts after litigation of nearly
seven years.
Mr Bishop has a very difficult
task before him to try and secure
the fulfillment of treaty stipula
tions with bis tribe judging from
the experience of other tribes.
Members Of The Osage
Nation Attack Oil Leases
Of The Osage Reser
vation.
Some of the members of the
Osage Council who refused to give
their consent to the oil leases
which the Interior Department
has insisted upon having them do,
have commenced proceedings in
the United States court against
the approval of the leases.
C. A. Towne, formerly a mem
ber of Congress from this state,
has been retained by the I-idians
as their leading counsel.
The complaint charges collusion
or fraud in connection with the
leases. Ballinger Raises Another
Issue.
The Secretary of the Interior
and others who are the defendants
in the suit brought against them
by John G. Morrison, Jr., as presi
dent of the General Council of
Minnesota Chippewas, to prevent
the expenditure of $160,000 of the
tribal funds of the Chippewas of
state which, it is claimed by
ihe plaintiff, is not authorized by
to expend, have appealed
the recent decision rendered by
United States Court of Ap
peals against them.
Webster Ballinger, attorney for
the Chippewas, has made a motion
to revoke the order of the court
staying mandate on the grounds
that the appellants have not furn
ished the proper bond that there
is no statutory authority for the
staying of the mandate on an ap
peal in such a case Vis the one
which Mr. Morrison is prosecut
ing without the party prosecuting
the appeal first files a satisfactory
bond or undertaking. Mr. Ballin
ger claims in his motion that the
appeal as allowed operates as a
supersedeas and the effect is to de
prive the appellees of the rights to
which the Court of Appeals of the
District of Columbia by its decis
ion and decree held them entitled
to. Trying To Get Gabriel
Saice An Appoint-
men'.
Dan W. Lawler has appealed to
Fred B. Lynch and Congre&sraan
Van Dyke to try and secure for
Gabriel Saice au appointment as
special officer for the suppression
of intoxicating liquor into Indian
country. This is a position which
is now filled by Edmund Bellaud,
whom the Democrats of this res
ervation have been opposed to.

CLAPP.
Opposed To The
Van Metre Bill.
It is learned that the Interior
Department is opposed to the bill
recently introduced in Congress
by Congressman Steenerson, which
John T. Van Metre is now urging
at Washington, and which pro
vides to give probate courts juris
diction over inherited allotments.
The bill in fact proposes to leg
alize by its terms the inherited
land sales of this reservation4 and
likewise the alleged sales.
Under existing laws the Com
missioner of Indian Affairs has
the authority to legalize the sales

by approval or by issuing fee
patents for the allotments upon
the npphcations of the heirs, but
this the Van Metre bill proposes
to take out of his hands, or the
hands of the Secretary of the Inliving
terior.
The Van Metre bill is so radical
hat members of this reservation
will protest against it, for it gives
the heirs and allottees no discre
tion with regard to applying for
fee patents.
The delegation now at Washing
ton will either oppose the bill in
its entirety or try and have it
amended. They intend to also
call the attention of the commit
tees on Indian affairs to the fact
that while Mr. Van Metre is of
Indian blood he is not of Chippe
wa extraction, and that he does
not represent the Chippewas but
the land buyers of this reserva
tion.
Tak Steps For An Early
Payment.
The representatives of the Chip
pewas of Minnesota, who are still
at Washington, took steps last
week to secure an immediate class
ification of the Chippewas of Min
nesota to ascertain to whom pay
ments of their respective shares of
the one-fourth of the tribal fund
could be made immediately.
In a letter to the Secretary of
the Interior the representatives
set fourth that the payment now
to be made was in fact, as to apart
of the fund at least, long since due
