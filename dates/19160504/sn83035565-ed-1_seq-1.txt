- Political Gossip from
Washington.
Washington, May 3. (Special
Correspondence.) "Farmers all
over this country are considera
bly stirred up over rural credits
legislation," said a southern mem
ber of Congress. 'The idea has
cpme to be quite prevalent that
the administration has 'cold feet'
on the rural credits proposition
and that the proposed bill, which
has the backing of tjie President",
is merely a makeshift and not
what the farmers of the country
want. My mail is filled with
protests f rom farmers, and other
members tell me the same thing.
L is being frequently whispered
about, that the administration,
which two years ago was in fav
or of rural credits, has grown
lukewarm on the subject. The
farmers throughout the country
are not to be fooled and they are
giving the men who are back of
this rural credits proposition some
anxious moments. It is stated
about the capitol that the plan
was to pass a rural credits bill
just previous to adjournment at
this session, which falls far short
of the'demands of the farmers of
the country. I think it is a mighty
good thing the farmers are 'smo
king the President out' on this
proposition.'"

presses, but I must say that this
session of the 64th. has accomp
lished about as little as any in
the history of the government,"
said, a middle-west Democratic
membtr. "Here we have been
in session nearly five months and
practically nothing has been done.
None of the great auestions con
fronting us have been solved or
met and there is no telling, when
they will be. Here our revenues
are falling behind appallingly and
yet nothing is being done to re
plenish them. The Democratic
party cannot continue this do
nothing policy and expect to get
away with it. Our party leaders
seem all at sea and are not pull-
log togeiner in unison or nar
mony. This Congress must wake
up pretty soon and do something
or a good many of us will not be
here after this session."

"The trimming the Bryan fa
mily got in Nebraska in the re-
centj primaries shows that the
once peerless leader is . slipping
badly' said -a western Demo
cratic member. The truth is that
the people have got tired 6f the
dictation of Bryan. Any man in
any party who assumes to. do all
of the thinking for the party and
who takes on himself the prerog
ative of settling all public ques
tions, is riding to f all. When
you get right down to : brass
tacks, the American people do
their own thinking, and they
have never yet failed to rebuke
the men who thought for a fleet
ing moment .they ruled the uni-

A recent visitor at the capital
was National Committeeman V,
L. Highland of West Virginia.'
He was most optimistic as to the
Republican situation in his state.
He said that there is already
great interest manifested in the
primaries to choose delegates to
the coming National Republican
convention. They will be held
on May 4.' Speaking of the po
litical outlook in West Virginia
he said: "There is no question as
to the way our state will go in
the general election. We shall
carry West Virginia for the na
tional and state tickets and elect
an almost entire Republican del
egation to the next Congress."

"I can tell you the administra
tion is 'sweating' some on this
Mexican proposition, ' ' said a Dem
ocratic congressman from one of
the border states. "President
Wilson has at last discovered
that when he joined hands with
Carranza he got hold of a redhot
poker. He is trying to let loose now
and he cannot. I aid pretty well
satisfied that he is looking for ia
chance to back out of Mexico and
get the American troops away.
I am a good Democrat, but let
m say one thing. If the admin
istration pulls the troopp out of
Mexico after all this ado and af
ter what has happened down
there, then in my opinion, you
can sing the 'swan song' forv our
parly. We will be buried be
neath the votes of the American
people and we ought to be."

Prospects seem favorable for a
good crop of cherries, pears, &c ,

giving off sweet odors to perfume
the air and enliven gratitude to

Commenting on the retirement
of the Democratic state chairman
in New York, the Evening Post
remarks upon the failure of Pres
ident Wilson to give Chairman
Osborne any adequate support
'Once in the presidency," says
he Post, "Mr. Wilson's interest
in the rehabilitation of the party
in New York waned very rapid-
" This is by no means sur
prising to those who understand
the Wilson habit of mind. Once
in office, it is the President' gen
eral custom to disregard much,
if not all, that has characterized
his campaign declarations. The
manner in which he has kicked
holes in the Baltimore . platform
is sufficient evidence On this point.
But as another election approach
es Mr. Wilson is showing more
interest in the party in New
York. From indifference he is
becoming very different. But the
damage has already been done,
and probably beyond repair. He
cannot again appeal to the inde
pendent Democrats of New York
as he did in 1912; and most as
suredly he cannot successfully
court the favor of Tammany,
When he failed to support Chair
man Osborne, he made it certain
that the Democrats of New York
will not adequately support him

OHIO'S CAMPAIGN
AGAINST SALOONS
Most Thorough Preparation Ever
Attempted By Any State.
GETTING READY F03 BATTLE
i
Work Ha Already Begun and It In
clude a Survey of the Liquor Traf
fic, a Complete Organization of the
Temperance Forces and an Educa
tional Campaign Which la Expected
to Reach to the Remotest Corr.er of
the State.
Columbus, 0 (Sepcial.) What Is
(".eclarcd by temperance leaders of the
country to be the most stupendous
campaign evor planned against tho
liquor traffic in any state Is being
tarefully mapped out in detail by the
Ohio Antl-Saioon league. Part of the
work is tew under way. .
Holding as incidental the date cf
the next election on statewide pro
hibition, ihe campaign now on ha3
for Its object as complete prepared
ness as possible for hie next battle,
whenever it may occur.
The approval given to the general
p'aji by the trustees of the state
league and the chairmen of the coun
ty dry organizations was equivalent
to pressing the button which set ia
lrotion the machinery. The rapidity
of the revolutions of the .wheels of
this machinery depends largely on the
activity of the temperance forces of
the state. So Tar as the Anti-Saloon
league and kindred organizations are
concerned, this Is expected to be the
tusiest year in Ohio temperance his
tory. The last two statewide campaigns
;".ave served to clear the atmosphere
and have permitted a survey of the
line-up of the contending forces. The
drys now know the odds they are fac
ing and do not propose to go into the
battle unprepared. When the next
contest begins every temperance maa
and woman is expected to be equipped
end ready.
. - The 'educational work will begin at
ence. More voters are to be Informed
concerning the work of the saloon and
the drink traffic. The Anti-Saloon
league believes that with the facta
pressed home, the careless and indif
ferent will become active workers lor
dry state.
Throughout the program for pub
licity, organization, general survey
and all other phases of preparedness,
pecial attention will be given to sys
tematic action in all parts of the state,
'ihe plan of organization contemplates
eaching from the block, school dis
trict and precinct up t'nrcgh the
county to the state organization.
In order to get a good working
basis, a general survey of the liquor
traffic is being made. This survey
will include everything about the
cueration of the saloon that will help
ihe dry cause. The survey is also ex
pected to show in a practical way the
relation of alcohol to crime and pau
perism, how alcohol effects the em
ployer and employe, and the family.
as well as the relation of drink to dis
ease and its effects on business.
The Anti-Saloon league is going on
tte belief that if the voters have the
facts before them, they will be guided
ty these facts when they go to the
polls, and it is facts that the investi
gators intend to secure.
While the work is not of t'ne kind
that is accomplished by noise and red
Are, it is believed to be necessary as
a foundation for an effective campaign
to make Ohio dry.
