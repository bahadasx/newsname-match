Bandits Together.
REACH AGREEMENT
Mexican Military Men Believe That in
View of the Troops Dispositions to
Be Made by General Obregon in Co
operation of the Tentative Agree
ment Made With General Scott, the
Withdrawal of American Troops
From Mexico Will Take Place in
About Two Months—Bandits May
Be Eliminated in That Time.
EL PASO, Tex., May 3.—Mexican
military men believe that the with
drawal of the American troops from
Mexico will take place In about two
months, it was learned here tonight.
American officers would make no com
ment.
The Mexicans say that in view of
the troop dispositions fo be made by
General Alvaro Obregon, in co-opera
tion with the tentative agreement
made with General Hugh L. Scott,
the running down of the bandit groups
in Chihuahua and Durango can scarce
ly take more than that, period of time.
On assurances from Genera! Car
runza that the bandits are dispersed,
the northward movement of American
troops will attain full speed and it
will not be long until the last troop
er crosses over the international boun
dary lines. In the meantime, it. was
pointed out, there will be constant
movements northward of American de
tachments.
Answers to dispatches sent today to
Washington by General Scott and to
Queretaro by General Obregon were |
not expected to be received here be
fore tomorrow. In case the terms set
tled upon by General Scott and Gen
eral Obregon are approved by Presi
dent Wilson and General Carranza,
the present negotiations practically
will be concluded, although the form
ality of another conference will be
gone through with either tomorrow
night or Saturday.
it is probable mat no American
troop movements will be begun until
General Carranza has signified his ac
ceptance of the stipulated conditions
by the Washington government.
After that, however, the Mexican
and American troops are expected to
begin at once a co-operative campaign
that will efefcttvely stamp out the
various bandit groups.
SCOTT SENDS REPORT
WASHINGTON, May 3.—A long
telegram in code readied the war de
partment late tonight from General ;
Scott at Kl Paso giving a full report j
on his conference with General Ob- ■
regon, the Carranza war minister. Up .
to the time the message was de- [
ciphered the Washington government !
had no official knowledge of the re- '
suit of the discussion between the [
two military advisers, although ad- •
ministration officials had made no se-|
cret of their satisfaction over the
news in press dispatches from the
border saying that an understanding
had been reached and danger of
clash with the de facto Mexican gov- ;
eminent removed. I
General Scott sent a brief message
during the day that he was preparing
a full report for later transmission |
to Secretary Baker. The secretary anil j
General Bliss, acting chief of staff,
were on watch for the report all day
and until far into the night. As the
hours passed, however, it became clear
that no action toward ratification of
the agreement could be taken until
President Wilson had studied General j
Sciott's dispatch tomorrow. j
The Mexican problem is being hand
led by the president personally, it is
understood, and no steps will be ta
ken without iiis sanction. It has been
hinted that it was Mr. Wilson him
self who suggested the conference be
tween General Scott and General Ob !
regon. j
Officials apparently saw no
son to doubt the press reports from :
El Paso giving the substance of
tentative agreement..
The reports bear out information
here as to the scope of the powers
given General Scott in the additional
instructions sent him after General
Ohregon's insistence on tlte imme
