RECORD OF DEATHS.
Short Sketches of the Lives of Per
sons Who Have Recently
Passed ' Away.
Mary Jane Madden.
After an illness of nine weeks,
Mary Jane wife of Jehu Mad
den, passed away at their home at
Three Springs, on Saturday, April
8, 1916, aged 72 years, 2 months
and 22 days. The funeral servi
ces were conducted by her pas
tor, Rev. J. M. Fenton, who in
accordance with Mrs. Madden's
request, preached from Revela
tion 21:4.
Her body was laid to rest in
the little cemetery just above the
village, while many friends and
loved ones gathered round her
tomb. - She leaves to mourn her
departure, her husband, Mr. Je
hu Madden, two daughters, Mrs.
B. F. Rinker, Mt. Union, Pa.;
Mrs. Grant J. Anderson, Three
Springs. Pa. ; and four sons, E.
J. Madden, Meadow Gap, Pa.;
A. S. Madden, Orbisonia, Pa. ;
Ralph Madden, Chester, Pa. ; and
Russell B. Madden, HireeSprings
Pa.
Mrs. Madder had always been
a devoted and J'end mother, and
her absence in the home will be
deeply felt. For many years she
had been a faithful Christian and
a member of the Old School Bap
tist Church located in Springfield
township, two miles from her
village home. She always loved
to go t the little meeting house
and during her last years when
she coulcT.no longer go, her pas
tor would some times conduct
services in her home.
Her mind was stored with
beautiful hymns, and with choice
passages from God's Holy Word
which proved a great comfort in
declining days, and robbed death
of all its terrors.
Porter Gordon.
As a result of a stroke of para
lysis Porter Gordon died at his
home in West Newton, Pa., on
Thursday evening, April 27, 1916
aged 51 years. Pie was a son of
the late Hon. Peter Gordon, of
Fort Littleton, and went to West
Newton, Pa., thirty years ago,
where he established a news
stand and stationery store which
he conducted successfully until
the time of his death. Honest
ind industrious, and taking a
ceen interest in the welfare of
lis adopted town, he won for
limself a host of sincere friends,
and prosperity in his business.
Notwithstanding this, however,
he never forgot the friends of
his early boyhood, and there was
no place for which he had a great
er love than "Little Fulton" the
county of his nativity. Besides

township, was born April 17,
1916, died April 18th and was
buried at Bethlehem on the 19th.
While the child was just a bud
on earth to blossom in heaven, it
was the mother's first loss in
seven children born, and her
grief is just as real as though the
child had been taken away at a
more advanced age.
Mrs. Phoebe Keefer.
Mrs. Phoebe Keefer, aged 65
years, 5 weeks, and 1 day, died at
her home at Potts Mill, Sunday,
April 23, 1916. The funeral took

Rev, Dotterman, and interment
MAINTENANCE OF EARTH ROADS.
To Preserve a Properly Built Earth
Road It Must He Continuously
Looked After.
There is nothing better than a
good road drag. As continuous
use of the drag prevents the ne
cessity of extensive repairs and
keeps the road always in good
condition. It should not be in
ferred that the drag is able to do
the york of a grader. When it
becomes necessary to move any
quantity of material, the grader
must always be used. A drag
simply fills the rut.4, and smooths
and puddles the surface of the
road. It also has the ability to
move small quantities of material
towards the center of the road,
so that its continuous use will
maintain the crown. Perhaps its
greatest advantage is the ability
of the drag to puddle or smear
the surface with thin layers of
material which gradually become
waterproof and hard while dry
ing. It is hardly necessary to state
that dragging should begin at
the outer edge cf the road and
continue toward the - center.
DraggirT should r,lway3 be d.we
whn the rc."d is wet, but not so
sticky that the mud clings to the
blade.
Dragging a dry road is of no
benefit, and may even be harm
ful; because it breaks up the wa
ter proof coat formed by previous
dragging.
The annual cost of dragging a
road is such a small item that it
is difficult to understand why the
system does not bvedme more gen
eral. I might say, in conclubion
that it requires the continuous
uie of a drag to bring about the
required results. Eaoh time you
drag a road t!;e cost or rather
the time diminishes.
A fe.v dragging? and you have
a good hard snioo;.h surface that
will shed all water and instead of
the traffic keening in one rut it
will be spread all over the sur
face which is of the utmost im
portance for a good road bed.
Now one word to the traffic
Keep out of the ruts, as far as
possible. By so doing, you can
help us maintain better roads.
Oh that each farmer might be
come so much interested in the
roads that he would make and
use a drag on his own property.

Last Saturday evening when
McClain's freight wagon was de
scending Cove mountain on the
Lincoln Highway about the Eck-
ert place, Harvey Cooper was
overtaken walking. Mr. Cooper
was invited to a seat in the wag
on. In attempting to mount the
Beat without the wagon stopping,
he placed ,one foot on the end of
the doubletree, and as he was
about to spring iuto the seat, his
foot slipped off the end of the
doubletree and he fell to the
ground, the front wheel of the
wagon passed over the foot and
ankle of one of his feet crushing
it very badly. He was taken to
his home and a surgeon called.
He is getting along as well as
could be expected.
Accident to Bark Teckr.
Percy Mentzer, of East End
Extension, was working on J. W.
Mellott's bark job, on Scrub
Ridge Monday, when his axe
took a sudden twist as he was
"ringing" a tree and caught
Percy in an ankle causing a pain
ful wound.

ground near Millstone, Md. The

Merrill II. Baker.
Merrill Henry Baker, son of
Mr. and Mrs. Grant Baker of
Knobsville, died on the 12th of
April. He was two weeks and
five days old. The remains were
laid to rest in the Knobsville

BOW MUCH !S "ENOUGH?"
When the People Want a Chance and
Better Service Can be Had.
Did you ever hear such a wail !
Surely it is the cry of a tyro and
not a statesman !
"Enough" is not argument but
envy and selfishness a desire
for office and not for service.
"Enough" what? Experience?
You do not turn down your fam
ily physician; the attorney who
has attended to the legal affairs
of your family and has a thorough
knowledge of all the intricacies
of your case, nor the pastor, who
has ministered in your home
through all the experiences of
joy and sorrow. NO ! In the
crucial hour you want the exper
ienced hand and mind and heart.
"Enough" experience? How
absurd the thought I Shall we
"swap homes" while swimming
the stream ?
Is not this the hour of crisis,
when accumulated experience and
service are needed above all else ?
Why the clamor for "change"
and inexperience ? We do not
act thus in the affairs of private
or busiaess life, nor should it
prevail in the realm of our Na
tional life. As long as the ser
vice is satisfactory we do not ask
for a change for change sake.
Service renders one efficient and
va'uable to all the interests at
str.ke.
Are not the very highest in
terests of our Nation at stake
this very hour? No untried
hands are needed at the helm.
The . hour is too critical. The
conservation of all that has been
so dearly won from the days of
'7G to the present hour is involv
ed. The respect of the world at
large must be regained and
America's place "in the s.in" so
fixed that Liberty may ag:u'n en
lighten the world ! And her
voice be heard above "the tumult
and the shouting," pointing the
way to assured peace and Na
tional honor !
No time for tyros--men trre
and tried must face duty un
flinchingly. "Enough" try acain !
"EXPERIENCE."
Huntington, Pa., April 27, 1916.
We might add that these as
saults made upon Congressman
Focht by his opponent in letters
and displayed newspaper adver
tising come with little grace from
one who has had the soft snap of
being an old bachelor and lawyer
with the high cost of living not
worrying him and who has held a
high salaried public job nearly
all his lite. Williamson holds one
now a3 attorney for the State
Reformatory at Huntington and
has held as many as two at one
time from which he drew salary
from the State. He received his
education at State College on a
scholarship while the Govern
ment educated his brother at
West Point and is now educating
a nephew there, to say nothing
of the offices his father held.
Focht's father, who was born
and raised in Huntiugdon county,
died from the effects of exposure
for his country in 18(54 when the
Congressman was one year old,
and when B. K. F. went to State
College to school his way was
paid out of the slender means of
a widowed mother. All he has
ever secured by way of prefer
ment he had to battle for and
stood by a principle to get, and
he always made good to the peo
ple and the Republican Party.
This "Enough" business is
surely a glass-house proposition
for Williamson.
Focht will be nominated all
right and he will win clean.

Thompson township, and Miss
Nellie V., daughter of George

APRIL HONOR ROLL.
Names of New Subscribers, and of Oth
ers Who Paid Snbscription During
the Mouth of April.
Habits of people change. Es
pecially in business matters. The
young men of to-day are more
successful than their fathers.
They are more methodical. Slip
shod methods won't go. They
are afraid of unpaid bills. This
is very noticeable in newspaper
subscriptions. Most people find
it easier to pay for their paper in
advance. Very few let it run a
year. This method makes it eas
ier for the subscriber. It is so
much better for the publisher.
If the publisher loses a dollar on
a bad-pay subscriber, he loses
the profits on twenty prompt
payers. To those who paid dur
ing the past month, here's a
good big THANK YOU, and may
good luck and plenty of it be
yours during the whole of the
coming years. You will be in
terested in looking over the list
and seeing the names of the per
sons who read and appreciate the
News every week. If you are
not a subscriber, why not start
in right now.

Good Words for Harris.
Geo. A. Harris, Esq., will re
ceive a large vote in other coun
ties of the district as well as in
Fulton. The newspapers through
out the district wherever Mr.
Harris has been, Bpeak kindly of
his candidacy.
The Lewistown Daily Senti
nel on his recent visit to that
place says, "Geo. A. Harris, Mc
Connellsburg, Democratic candi
date for Congress in this district
was a Iiewistown visitor to-day
and was kept busy shaking hands
with the voters and exchanging
greetings. Mr. Harris has a
pleasing personality and made a
good impression. He is not un
known in the district in political
matters. He was a Wilson Pres
idential Elector in the district in
1912. He is popular whereever
known. Mr. Harris i3 identified
with the history and interest of
the Juniata Valley. His great
grandfather settled in Miffiin
burg in 1790 and was one of the
men who helped form Mifflin
County out of Cumberland. His
ancestors being settlers here
gives Mr. Harris a special inter
est in the Juniata Valley almost
equivalent to residence here."
The New Berlin Reporter,
of New Berlin, Union County
says, "That Mr. Geo. A. Harris,
of McConnellsburg, Democratic
candidate from the Seventeenth
Congressional District motored
into town accompanied by others
from Lewisburg, on Tuesday
morning. M r. Harris, after
whose progenitors, the Capital
city bears its name; wa3 well re
ceived by his manv friends. He
comes well recommended by all
who know him. One of our
townsmen says, 'As worthy and
honorable a candidate as ever
tread upon your soil."
That Mr. Harris will receive
the nomination goes without say
ing; and after the nomination,
his rival will find that in Mr.
Mr. Harris he has a foe worthy
of his steel. Right in the prime
of life, full of energy and get
there, with a clean business and
political record, he possesses the
assets essential to a winner.
There is no one in the District
perhaps, who has such a wide ac
quaintanceship throughout the
District as Mr. Harris, and no
one who has been more unselfish
in his efforts to help others. So
when it comes down to the final
show up in November, it will be
found that voters of all parties
have rallied to his support.
State Agriculture Notes.
A letter to the Department of
Agriculture from a Juniata Coun
ty correspondent states that 100
years ago, in 1816, there was lit
tle or no summer and no crops
in that section.
Elk County farmers in Benzing
er Township have organized a
co-operative creamery at St.
Marys and are going back to
dairying as they feel it is their
main dependence.
Crows are said to be unusually
plentiful and a complete pest in
some parts of Lackawanna Coun
ty where they are destroying
crops and eating young chickens.
The Bureau of Farm Advice of
the Department of Agriculture
has listed W. Theo. Wittman,
poultry expert, to give lectures
and demonstrations during the
latter part of April at the follow
ing places: April 20. Smethnort:
April 24, Kane; April 25, Oil

HOW TO PRESERVE HEARING.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgicne by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. 0., LL 0.,
Commissioner of Health.
The ear is one of the most del
icately formed organs in the hu
man body. It is in direct and
close relation to the brain, Its
three parts, the external, middle
and internal are most intimately
connected. The abuse of the
external ear or that part which
stands out from the head and i3
known even by childrtn as the
ear, is often reflected to these
parts that cannot be seen and do
permanent harm.
Those in care of children should
never permit a child's ear to be
pulled tr slapped a3 such abuse
will frequently cause inflamma
tion of the middle ear and when
that is diseased the inner ear may
take on the same condition.
The external ear is thin and
when exposed to cold will become
frost bitten sooner than other
parts of the body. It should
therefore be protected from
freezing.
When exposed to heavy air
pressure in a tunnel or when
there is heavy cannonading or
blasting, the mouth should be
partly open to permit equal pres
sure on either side of the drum
which is an extremely thin mem
brane that divides the external
from the middle ear.
The healthy ear should never
be cleansed beyond the surface
that is plainly seen by the eye.
The wax will naturally accumu
late and work out into the ex
ternal ear, when it can be re
moved without dangerof hurting
the more delicate part of the or
gan. Children should be taught that
it is dangerous to put things in
the ear. If any little object like
a bean, button, or insect should
get into the ear it should not be
dug after. Many ears have been
destroyed by those ignorant of
the formation of the ear, digging
after some foreign body that ha3
lodged well in the orifice. If the
object cannot be lifted out a doc
tor should be consulted. If med
ical aid cannot be had, a careful
syringing is the best and most
innocent method of removing ob
stacles. In case of animate things
such as insects, getting into the
ear, it is advisable to pour olive,
cotton seed or any other pure neu
tral oil in to kill and remove the
same. The common use of oil
for an ear ache is a mistake as it
is hard to remove and frequently
gets gummy and collects dirt.
The ear is often injured by
sniffing fluids up the nostrils
which cause inflammation of the
eustachian tube, which is a little
duct that leads from the mcuth
to the ear. The ear is such a
useful and delicate organ it should
be cared for by a physician when
trouble occurs.
Birthday Party.
Robert E. Diehl of Whips Cove
wouldn't mind being fifty years
old or a hundred and fifty if
every time a birthday came
around, his neighbors would
come in and make the day as
pleasant for him as they did on
Sunday the 16th of April. He
doesn't know just how they
found out that he was half a hun
dred that day, but they did; and
before dinner was ready, along
came Edgar A. Diehl and his
wife and son Marshall and daugh
ter Rintha; Emory A. Diehl and
wife; George Diehl and wife and
son Harper; Howard Layton and
wife; Vernon Mellott, wife, and
sons Leroy and Elwood, daughter
Marian; Mr. and Mrs. A. S. Lay
ton and daughter Velma, and
sons Merrill and Wayne; Adam
Harmon, and Scott Crawford.
They had a good crowd, a good
dinner, a good time, with good
music and good singing; after
having staid a good while, they
all said good bye, wishing Robert
good luck and a good many more
birthdays.
