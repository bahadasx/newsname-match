appropriated by the legislature. Disbursements
were made to 311 schools
in 32 counties. Amounts runged from
$6 to buy blackboards at Fingerville
in Spartanburg county to $750 to help
run the Anttoch Industrial school seven

325 pupils and pays a local school
tax of 16 mills. The patrons contributed
$500 additional in order to secure
this allotment of state aid for their
seven months' term.

has been used as fa- as possible to

These minor deficiencies have
been, too long overlooked. The first
attempt to remedy them was mude in
1914. when representatives from some
of the country districts secured an appropriation
of $45,000 for equalizing
purposes. In 1915 this appropriation
was raised to $60,000; hut the legislature
of 1916 reduced the amount to
$40,000.

Guard Is Ready to Answer Call. * *
While no orders have been received
from the war department at Washington
the officers of the South Carolina
National Guard are making plans for
any emergency. All necessary orders
for the movement of troops have been
prepared. The same steps are being
taken in other states, according to
press dispatches.
"This letter is written to you merely
as a guide to show what would be
expected of you in the event of a call
to arms," says a letter from W. W.
Moore, adjutant general, to P. J
Drew, chief quartermaster of the
South Carolina National Guard.
In the event of a call for troops the
entire National Guard, except the
coast artillery, will proveed to Styx,
the state camp ground in Lexington
county, about 12 miles from Columbia.
Each company will be required to recruit
up to its minimum strength.
"The regiments will remain at Styx."
says the letter, '.until the entire com
mand has been recruited up to the war
strength of 150 men per company and
fully uniformed, armed and equipped.
"Cl.n.,1.1 (kn , hn 1. 11 I
you will report at once to the mobilzation
camp to receive, shelter, maintain
and supply at that camp the regiments
ordered there."
The cost artillery would be ordered
to Fort Moultrie at Charleston for
duty.
Fire Insurance Law Still In Force.
The supreme court refused to sign
an order enjoining the insurance commissioner
and the attorney general
from enforcing the terms of the anticompact
fire insurance act of the last
legislature. The decision dismissing
the petition of David B. Honderson of
Charleston for an injunction was signed
by all of the justices of the supreme
court.
The constitutionality of the Laney
Odom act was attacked at a recent
hearing by attorneys representing Mr.
Henderson, who has been engaged in
the fire insurance business in Charleston
for many years. The state officials
were represented at the hearing
by Thomas H. I'eeplos, attorney general.
"The petition is dismissed and the
injunction, refused." said the decision
of the court. The opinion was written
by Associate Justice Fraser.

The President expressed confidence
j that in time of trouble the great mass

1 the slightest doubt of what would
happen when America called upon
I those of her citizens born in other

"Why, they will come with cheers,
they will come with a momentum
! which will make us realize that America
has once more been cried awake
out of every sort of distemper and
I dream and distraction, and that any
[ wan who dares tamper with the spirit
of America will he cast out of the

Washington. ? Announcement in
press dispatches from Berlin that Amzassudor

Ambassador Gerard in visiting the

GREAT ACTIVITY ALONG
THE BRITISH FRONT.
London.?Great activity at various
points along the British front is re

carried out a successful raid near Car!
noy. There has been artillery activity
; at La Boisselle. Hebuterne, MonchyI

tieres and Frelinghein.
At Frelinghein the Germans enter|
ed the British trenches but were
j driven out. Similar attacks on the
j British trenches on hill No. GO and
at St. Kloi were repulsed.
The sectors of Avocourt and Mumi1
eres, northwest of Verdun are still
under heavy bombardment. The Gcr
j mans nave attempted no infantry attacks
here, according to the Paris
communication, but those artillery
preparations usually presage an at
j tack.
| The Germans on the front of Had
i ramount and Traumont and between
j Ouaumont and Vaux, essayed attacks
I following violent bombardments but
the French curtnln fires held them
to their trenches.
Artillery engagements have featur
ed the fighting on the other parts of
the line in France dnd Belgium, although
the French aircraft have carried
out hoomhing operations against
numerous German positions. The
German guns are keeping tin their

British campaign in Mesopota- '

j General Townseml and the garrison at
Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris ltiver. |
about 130 miles below Bagdad. Some I
10,000 men in nil laid down their arms
to the Turks, after having destroyed .
all their guns and munitions.
The British Mesopotamlan campaign.
waged along the Tigris from the
Persian Gulf northward, almost to the
gates of Bagdad, had as its chief object
the capture of that ancient city.
To divert the Turkish forces from
Gallipoli was another object. When
almost at the point of achieving its
main object late last year, the effort
broke down at Ctestphon, 18 miles
from Bagdad, when the Turks, alarm
ed for the safety of the town of fabled
memory, rushed up reinforcements, inflicting
a defeat upon the British and
I compelled their retreat 110 miles down :
the Tigris to Kut-el-Amara. where the I
Turks had them securely bottled up. j (
General Townseml held out for 143 i
days, his supplies steadily growing h
lower as he waited the relief of the
army which, first under General Aylmer,
and then under General Gorringe, ,
battled its way up the Tigres toward
him. This army encountered strong i
positions of the Turks below Kut on !
both sides of the river and. although
several of these were carried, it has
not been able to work much closer to j
the beleaguered garrison than a score
of miles because of the stubborn Turk
ish resistance and Hood conditions on
the Tigres. j

Washington.?An official declaration
of the attitude of the United States
toward armed merchant ships, Just
made public by Secretary Lansing,
reiterates and explains the purpose of
the American Government to recognize
the right of peaceful vessels to
carry arms for defense and, at tinsame

The declaration was issued in the
form of a memorandum .prepared by

direction during the Secretary's brief
vacation last month. Copies of it
were given to each of the Embassies i
and legations here; and while no official

COTTON FUTURES
BILL IS ADOPTED
AFTER SPIRITED DEBATE HOUSE
AS A WHOLE VOTES
101 TO 23.
.
IDENTICAL WITH FORMER
Two Cents Pound Tax on Future Cotton
Sold in Exchances and Other
Similar Institutions.
Washington.?The house, sitting as
a committee of the whole, adopted the
Lever cotton futures hill as an
amendment to the annual agricultural
measure, after a spirited debate. The
vote was 101 to 23. The Lever bill
is identical with the former cotton
futures law, which was held unconstitutional.
by Federal Judge Hough
of New York on the ground that it
was a revenue bill which had improperly
originated in the senate, instead
of in the house.
Under the provisions of the measure,
a tax of two cents a pound would
be levied on all cotton sold for future
delivery in any exchange, board of
trade, or "similar institutions or
places of business."
Adoption of this measure came af
tor the house had passed, by a vote
of 1S4 to 86, a special rule providing
for consideration of the cotton future,
grain-trading, and federal warehouse
for agricultural products amendments,
as a rider on the agricultural appropriation
measure. Under the rule, a
little more than five hours' debute on
the amendments was permitted.
STORMY DEBATE OVER
NOMINATION OF BRANDEIS.
Committee Members Predict Unfavorable
Report on the Appointment.
Washington.?A stormy debate over
the nomination of Louis 1). Hrandeis
for the Supreme Court broke in the
senate, anil, before it was over, predictions
were made by two members
of the Judiciary Committee?one a
Democrat?that an unfavorable re
port on the appointment would follow
when the committee reached a vote.
Discussion was precipitated when
Senator Sutherland of Utah, a Republican
member of the committee, read
to the senate an interview published
quoting Senator Ashurst of Arizona as
charging that Republican members of
the Judiciary Committee were filibustering
in order to delay a vote on the
Hrandeis nomination, until after the
national political conventions.
Senator Ashurst stood steadfastly
by the quoted statement during the
heated argument, which followed, until
assured by fellow-Democrats on
the committee that there was no such
tiilibuster. He withdrew the charge,
at the suggestion of Senator llrandegee,
after he had denounced executive
sessions and charged that the
Republicans wore angered over the
Hrandeis nomination because he was
a champion of the masses.
FEDERAL GRAND JURY.
