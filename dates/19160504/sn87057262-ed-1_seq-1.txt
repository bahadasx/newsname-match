WASHINGTON, D. C., May 4.—
President Wilson's approval of Gen
eral Scott's report on his conference
with General Obregon, was the only
thing, required today to make their
agreement binding, as far as the
United States Is concerned.
During the forenoon, Secretary of
War Baker transmitted a 2,000 word
message to the president who gave it
careful consideration. Its contents
had not been revealed early today,
but it was assumed it followed the
line reported in United Press dis
patches of yesterday.
Army men were convinced an early
withdrawal is in sight. They thought
General Carranza will approve the
terms accepted by General Obregon.

Several lengthy messages from the
border reached the department to
day. Whether these gave additional
information on the Scott-Obregon
situation or detailed development in
Mexico, were not revealed.

REPLY FROM GERMANY
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing conferred on the situation
last night.
If the reply fails squarely to meet
the presidents' demands, it will not
be satisfactory. It was stated today
that the president has not wavered
in his determination that Germany
must acquiesce completely.
In German official circles here, it
is said Germany agrees with the
United States now on the question of
principle and that the only thing re
maining is to determine a "method"
of boat warfare against commerce,
that the two governments can agree
upon.
This is taken as assurance that
Germany has decided to stop her sub
marine warfare even if she does not
agree on how it may be resumed.
The first message from Gerard in
nearly a week, reached the state de
partment this forenoon and reported
a quantity of press comment. In
cluded in this was one article In
which it was said responsibility for
any break in relations would be upon
President Wilson.
