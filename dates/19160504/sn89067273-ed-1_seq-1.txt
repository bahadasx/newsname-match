and her husband and small child were
driving in a buggy and as they were
in the act of of passing over the rail
road track at the crossing the horse
caught its foot in a loose board and
in its efforts to free itself Mrs.Pulis
avers she was thrown from the vehi

HELEN KELLER 'HEARS.'
famous Woman Well Known in Mex
loo, Missouri.
Atlanta, Ga., May 1... Miss Helen
Keller, the world's most famous deaf
and blind woman, placed her fingers
on the lips and throat of Enrico Ca
ruso, in his rooms in the Georgian
Terrace Hotel, yesterday, and heard
him sing "The Lament of Sampson,"
blinded and in chains, grinding corn
for the Philistines."
Thru the medium of her sensitive
Angers the melodious voice of the
great tenor thrilled her and as she
sat and listened her blind eyes wet
with tears and she gasped over and
over and oyer again: "Wonderful!
Wonderful!
Caruso sang the aria in the first
scene of the last act of "Samson and
Delilah," and as he sang his 'eyes
filled with tears and his voice grew
husky with the pathos of the song.
"Oh, wonderful, wonderful,"
breathed Miss Keller. "Tho I cannot
see your face I can feel the pathos of
your song."
And with his lips against her hands
Caruso said:
"In your fingers I can feel your
soul. In your blue eyes your bouI is
shining."
Miss Keller almost collapsed so
powerfully had the voice of the tenor
and his kindly words stirred her.

ClicaKr The Thompson-Centralla

State Highway Engineer Frank
Buffum gave road enthusiasts a scare
hereabouts by threatening that If
some improvements were not speedi
ly made on the new road between
Thompson and Centralia the North
State Highway might be switched to
another route. The Mexico Commer
cial Club got busy and at their lunch
eon Saturday the 'matter was quite
thoroly discussed. A number of
farmers were present. W. W. Pol
lock. M. S. Bush, of Centralia; Joe
Considine, of Thompson, and others
made talks. It was resolved to meet
Mr. Buffum'B requirements within 30
I clays.
Assistant Highway Engineer Bode
of Jefferson City attended the meet
ing. A. C. MclCibbon of Clayton,
Mo., was also present and made a
very effective speech. He advocated
oil and dragging, for the dirt roads.
It gets results at the minimum cost,
he declared. Drain the roads thoroly
and drag and oil them. Many think
that is what will, finally be done with
the whole length of the North Mis
souri State Highway. Anything to
get along without the cost of rock
ought to be a go.

WOODCRAFT STORIES
Fifth
By L. Roy Ferris.
OME way or another, a fellow doesn't want to
work. Thinks the world owes him a living, and he's
very likely to drift off into bad company. So when
old Mr. Skunk looked out of his window, which was really
a small hole in the rocks in the side of the hill, he found the
pretty little wild pansies staring him in the face. They
have such a sweet, innocent look in their little faces, and
why they always select a rocky hill to grow on is a mystery
to me, unless they are not afraid of old Mr- Skunk and
Red Fox and Brother Wolf who live close by, and think
they might do some good by making these gentlemen
ashamed of themselves. So when Mr. Skunk saw the face
of dear little wild pansy looking him right in the eyes he
turned his head the other way, like a boy that has taken
marbles out of his seatmate's desk, but of course always
puts them back. But Mr. Skunk is not built that way. He
turned and went down the side of the hill until he came
to the creek. There was Mrs. Turtle on a log with her
three children right back of her. Mother Turtle always
sleeps with one eye open, and when Mr. Skunk made a
grab for the Turtle Fmily, into the water they went, and if
it had not been for a friendly limb preventing Mr. Skunk
form falling he would no doubt have been drowned.
Sister Coon who had come down to catch fish for
breakfast laughed at him and said, "Let me show you how
to catch a fish." She selected a place in the shallow be
tween two rocks, and after walking around in the water
until it had become muddy she quickly reached into the
water with her front paw and, much to -Mr Skunk's sur
prise, she held up a wiggling Channel Cat.
"Oh, let me hold it for you while you catch another,"
begged the Skunk, but she shook her head and after giving
it the customary scrubbing proceeded to eat it. Mr.
Skunk stood there waiting to lick the bones.
"My, you like fish, don't, you, Mrs. Coon," said the
Skunk.
"Not more than I do Crawfish," replied Mrs. Coon.
Tossing the Skunk the bones she reached down into
the water and picked up old Mother Crawfish and her
seventy-three babies and proceeded to give them a good
bath. No doubt they needed it, for they are always
crawling into every muddy
to eat Mother Crawfish and
the trouble began. Those long, wicked pincers of Mother
Crawfish were more than she could stand, and Mr. Skunk
laughed as the Crawfish dropped into the water-
Mother Crawfish called

swered, "Here I am, Mother."

INTERESTING MEETING.
Mothers and Others Entertain and
Are Entertained Themselves By
Pupils of the Central School.
By Mrs. Cbas. Rodgers.
The meeting of the Mothers and
Others Club at the Central School
Tuesday afternoon was well attended
despite the rain and threatening
weather. The unusual high stand
ard of entertainment was furnished
by the Program Committee but the
real treat came from the children
themselves. Miss Karnes can boast
a chorus of excellent voices trained
to take Che different parts and to
render rather difficult selections for
such youthful singers. Their own
pleasure and enthusiasm in the per
formance found v ready response
from the audience.
Miss Zola Beal's little folks gave a
delightful dramatization of "A Story
of Hearts," which proved to be a
real "heart-searching" lesson. She
lias brought out some remarkable
talent which probably was .unsus
pected by the children themselves.
It is a useful and most delightful art
and Miss Beal does well to cultivate
these talents.
Mrs. W. L. Reed gave to the moth
