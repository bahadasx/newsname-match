Wall Paper Samples
I have received sample lines of
Wall Paper from both Chicago
and Minneapolis, and will be
pleased to call and show them to
is one of the most won
derful inventions of the
age. It is absolutely
unique. Never before
has there been speed
without harm. Never before have women had any
thing which REALLY made dirt disappear as quickly,
as harmlessly, as EASILY as with this extraordinary
dirt loosener. It does HOURS work in MINUTES.
It positively will not fade colored clothes—shrink or
harden woolefi, and will not rot or weaken lace cur
tains so they tear easily, but keeps them STRONG
besides absolutely clean.

Miss Cora Newell, of Melrose
Twp., was in the city yesterday
in the interest of her candidacy
for the nomination to the officeof
Superintendent of Schools of
this county. Miss Newell has
just started her campaign but is
greatly encourage by the sup
port she is receiving.
The dance given for the bene
fit of the Band Monday evening
was not very largely attended,
only twenty-seven tickets being
sold. If the people of Hope want
a band it seems that they should
take a little interest in it and
give the boys some encourage
ment. All who attend the dance
report a most enjoyable time.
A good sized audience was
present at the Declamation Con
test last Friday evening. There
were Ave contestants and all made
splendid showings. The judges,
Atty. Sathre, Co. Supt. Blondie
Holt and Prof. Durenburger
selected the following prize win
ners, First, Ruth Bowen Second,
Amy Cockle Third, Lucena Ful
ler. Besides the declamations
several special music numbers
were given.
One of the biggest improve
ments being made in our city
this season is the remodeling of
the old Elliott Hotel property by
Mr. McKellips. The entire low
er floor has been torn out and
abasement is being dug under
a greater part of the structure.
This will be finished up in first
class shape, and steam heat and
running wated piped through
the building. The 'upstairs
rooms are also being fixed up
and rearranged.

It Improves With Use
There is a delightful thrill in the smoothness with which
the Willys-Knight motor "picks up" without "choking"—
without the slightest vibration.
There is great satisfaction in being able to throttle
it down to a walking pace on high gear.
But the remarkable superiority of the Knight sleeve-!
valve motor lies in the fact that—
Though all other motors grow noisy and lose power
and smoothness—
The Knight sleeve-valve motor grows steadily quieter
with use and increases steadily in power, smoothness and
all-around performance.
The factory's enormous production made it possible to
price this wonderful car at $1125 for the touring car, and
$1095 lor the Roadster.
Ask us to te'il you about the Willys-Knight.

Built for the
Business Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles and
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the frost is coming out of the ground
and the mud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
farmer's automobile. The price, $665, puts it with
in the reach of every business fanner. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
From every standpoint of mechanical excellence
and appearancc the Dort merits a careful investi
gation of the Business Farmer

show rooms.
