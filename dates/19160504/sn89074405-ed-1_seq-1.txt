TO AID EXPORT BUSINESS.
Federal Trade Body tJrgee Removal
of Doubt as to Anti-trust Laws.
Washington, May 4.—Legislation to
encourage American business men to
capture a share of the world's export
trade by removing all doubt as to the
application of antl-trust laws to ex
port business was recommended to
congress in a report to the federal
trade commission.
The commission says its investiga

established the fact that doubt as to
the application of the anti-trust laws
to export trade now prevents concert
ed action by American business men
in export trade, even among produc
ers of noncompetlng foods.

Berlin, May, 4.—A German corre
spondent on the Verdun front is quot
ed by the Overseas News agency as
declaring that the French during the

losses In their attempts to recapture
observation posts that the Germans
had taken.
The Germans, the correspondent

hind their lines available for the dis
position ot reserves and the bringing
up of supplies, while the French are
forced to concentrate in dense masses
In the sectors of a fan, the rims of
which are formed by the lines which
the Germans are attacking. Thus,
every road and every camping place,
in fact, every fiot of land is under
the German Are. while the French ar

seeking out spots where it Is supposed
the German troops are located.
On the other hand, the correspond
ent declares, each German shot finds
its mark and the German heavy ar

El Paso, May 4.—Ratification of
the tentative agreement reached
between Generals Scott and Obre
gon awaited only the acceptance by
President Wilson of the terms of
the proposed settlement. Advices
received In Juarez indicated
Carranza had given his oonaeht to
the terms agreed upon by Obregon.
The latter told his associates that
he saw no reason why a settlement
should not quickly be effected, and
he believed that tension between
the Mexicans and Americans would
quickly disappear when the news
spread that an understanding had
been reached that had for Its ob
ject the retirements of American
soldiers from Mexican soil.
Obrepon seemed gratified over re
ports that large mining companies
are planning to operate their prop
erties, and put people bpek to won.
Scott and Pnnston waited during
the day for word from WjuiMngtw
that they might, request a formal
oottference with Obregon and his
associates. Soott and Funston were
pleased with press dispatches from
Washington saying that the admin
istration found the terms of the
proposed settlement satisfactory.
The American conferees said that
official news might contain sugges
tions for some modification for the
proposed terms. They could not
say whether a conference will be
held today.

Stockholm, April 6.—Persistent re

WKeirthe Kuropean war broke out,

importance" of the Alands Is beyond
question. Properly fortified, they form
practically ah impassible barrier be

CONGRESSMEN
FLOODED WITH
LETTERS TODAY
EXPECTED TO MFIFil
Anti-war Propaganda Con
tinued—Husting Confers
With President.
Washington, May 4.—Printed form
letters, protesting against any step
which may lead to war with Germany,
began pouring in today by thousands
upon members of congress as a sequel
to the telegraph propaganda which
swamped the capitol and telegraph
companies last week.
Senator Husting, of Wisconsin, who
attacked the propaganda in the sen
ate, conferred with the president to
find if there is not some way by which
the department of justice could un
cover its source. He received letters
today, which, he said,- added evidence
to his charge that the American Em
bargo conference is behind 'thai' mq^ii
menti and,had declared a purpoteof
at:
least a severance »f.*di|iiloMt|ic rela
tions." Even the'names of tfohjrreSi^
men were printed on envelopes, and
everything gave evidence that the let
ters had been prepared by the thous
ands. and required only written signa
tures.
TENTATIVE PLANS
ARE AGREED TO
Washington, May 4.—Reorganisa
tion and federalization of the national
guard as proposed by the house,
whereby there would be created a
militia reserve of approximately. 400.
000 men, was tentatively agreed to by
the coiiferees of the army bill. The
senates' provisions for the national
guard were along the same line as
those In the house bill, but would pro
vide for only 250,000 men. Senate
amendments to the original senate bill
respecting the militia may be accepted
tomorrow, Including the Wadsworth
amendment which would require en
listed officers and men to take an osfiti
to the United States as well as to the
state.
The conferees struck a deadlock,
temporarily at least, when they reach
ed the federal volunteer army reserve
of the senate bill and after spirited
debate the matter was passed over
without action. This proposed'force
of 260,000 men which was twice saved
in the senate by a close rote after It
had been bitterly opposed by cham
pions of the national guard, probably
will not be agreed upon by the con
ferees. It was emphatically asserted
that the senate conferees would not
yield on the point and prediction was
made that the committee would have
to report a disagreement on that fea
ture and- seek further instructions
from the senate and house.
to have been mined and a consider
able garrison' is reported already es
tablished there.
The Swedish people very well un
derstand that the military prepared
ness now instituted on the islands is
directed, against Germany and not
against their country. They agree that
the war' with Germany entltlee the
Russians. to make military use of the
archipelago.. but there is some per
turbation as to. the aituation when the
war Is ended. The question has been
raised aa to whether Russia then will
submit again to the North sea-Baltia
treaty of im, according to which the
Alands should not be fortified, nor
used for military establishments. or
garrison of any sort: The public dis
cussion of this question turns upon
the reported extent of the fortifica
tions and the eare with which they
are said tto have" "been constructed.
There is even talk here that Russia
InteAde to make ef the Aland-Islands
a "Port Arthur of the Baltle."
This dtacusiion goes on deeplte the
