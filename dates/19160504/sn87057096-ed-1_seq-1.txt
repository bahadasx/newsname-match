WILL CHANGE THE ROAD
Will Use the Old K. & W. Grade and
Make it aPart of the Leon and
Pleasanton County Road.
The prospects at the time The Re
porter went to press yesterday noon
were mighty good that there would be
.a dandy good improvement made at
police on the Leon and Pleasanton
road, which is a part of the county
highway system. Recently Fred Bar
rett, the county bridge foreman, dis
covered that it would be a fine thing
to change this road which runs out
of Leon on street, then crosses Mag
ruder creek and across quite a stretch
of low bottom land which has always
been a hard road to keep, and make
use of the old abandoned K. & W.
grade, so that people who used the
Pleasanton road would leave town on
Main street, which is paved beyond
the railroad tracks, cross the cement
bridge and go south on the Davis
City road to where the road crossed
the old railroad grade, then use the
railroad grade around the McGrew
hill and on south, coming out to in
tersect. the Pleasanton road between
the house and barn on the Manchester
farm. The matter was talked of a
little, then petitions were gotten up
and signed by nearly everybody,
which were presented to the city,
council and the board of
*K2S
Z.&
supervisors, ma
me«X0moVniC„Ta»d"
supervisors, who were to take the
matter up yesterday afternoon, and
they will without doubt vote to make
the change. It will make a mighty
fine road, and make it much easier
for people living along this road to
reach Leon, as they would come in
over the paved street, and as it is
now, when they bring in stock they
have to drive nearly up town and then

FOOLISH TO PLANT BIO CORN.
Big, Late Maturing Varieties Docked
Under New Grade System.
Since most elevators in Iowa now
buy corn according to the new federal
grades,-price based on the amount of
moisture it contains, it is more nec
essary than ever that every farmer in
Iowa plant an early maturing corn
that will be sure to be in good crib
bing condition when husked, says
the farm crops department at Iowa
State College.
There is no longer any advantage
in planting the old "jumbo" type of
corn. It matures too late and al
though it produces a large tonnage
per acre, it will not.be profitable be
cause it will be seriously docked in
price at selling time.
It is not too early for farmers to
begin thinking about co-operating in
getting their corn crop to market,
either, suggests the department. It
will pay well for all farmers in one
neighborhood having No. 1 corn for
sale to co-operate and sell in carload
lots. They will secure the highest
market price for it.

Marguerite Clark in "Gretna Green'*
Friday, and Edith Taliaferro in
"Young Romance" Monday.
Marguerite Clark, the dainty and
fascinating stage and screen favorite
will be seen at the Idle Hour theatre
in the celebrated romance "Gretna
Green" on Friday of this week. Thia
quaint and picturesque play possesses
all the varying elements essential to
the successful serene drama, love,
sacrifice, honor, mystery and thrill,
and is laid in the charming period of
the nineteenth century, when daring
elopements to Gretna Green, a lover's
haven in the north of Scotland, added
a dash of excitement to many true
love-matches. In "Gretna Green,"
Marguerite Clark bewitchingly por
trays the adorable character of Dolly
Erskine, a little English belle and &
bit of a flirt, who queens it over the
beaux of the realm with sovereign
sway, until sne loses her heart under
circumstances both humorous and
dramatic. Matinee at

Probating Wills Before Death.
A Columbus, O., judge makes the
novel suggestion that wills be probat
ed before death. He would permit a
man to go into court with his will
properly executed, and demonstrate
his competency to execute such a tes
tament. It would not then be pos
sible after his death for disappoint
ed heirs to set up that he was "men
tally incapable," or subject to "un
due influence."
Under the present practice wills
are often broken after prolonged liti
gations on one or the other of these
grounds. Apparently, it is not a dif
ficult task to show that any dead man
was mentally deficient while alive.
But few heirs would have the hardi
hood to face the living maker of the
will in court, unless he was really
incapable of devising his property.
The effect of such a law would be
to relieve the court of a vast amount
of vexatious litigation. It would
also permit a man of sound miud to
devise his property precisely as he
wished, so long as his plans did not
run counter to public policy. Nor
would he wrap the drapery of his
couch about him and lie down for
the last long sleep, in the fear that
his name would be tarnished by his.

The Saturday Evening Post is a lot
like Ollie Hull's paper, the Leon Re
porter. One week we stop it and the
next week subscribe for it again.
Last week the Post was extraordinar
ily good again. One article by Sam
BIythe was good enough to pay for a
whole year. We often wonder if any
body really cards for the Democrat
as much as we care for some of the
pepers *ve get. Sometimes we think
nobody likes the Democrat.—Wash
