CLAY CITY ! v KENTUCKY
The oil business in Powell
county was giveji a good boost
Tuesday morninirwhen well No
3, on the Georgjj-W. Clark farm,
came In with a good flow at SOU
feet. B. A. Bqmvi;vile, who has,
thirsIgiW'tTt'ttst'hia sccu red-
fro'in Mr, Clark.,- for the-past two
weeks, was the successful man,
and nuturallv is greatlv plated
over the result of his efforts, as
ho was the first m in to come in
to the field and his work drew
the :it tent ion of other operators
to the I'owell fields, with the re
sult thai practically every avail
able acre (if land in tho county
is now under leaso, only u few
holding out for various reasons.
On Monday a strong gas pres
sure was encountered by the
drill and late. Monduy night in
dications pointed to the well
coming in Early Tuebday morn
ing (he oil rose to a height of
about onehundrHd i'pet, and was
accompanied by u strong flow of
umh. which is regarded by oil men
us a sign of u good -well..
Mr. Bdniiiville is now erecting
his tank, and will give the well a
thorough test with the pump,
after which he will movo his rig
to the Mary Harnett- farm, one
fourth of u mile from his present
location, where he will sink
another hole, Tho Clark wells
-will not be pumped commercially
until there aro enough wells to
warrant the erection of a power
station, and arrangements can be
made to ship the oil at u paying
rate.
With this strike, the oil busi
ness here is now assured and we
may look for Clay City to boom
In good style before long, as there
are hundreds of new men coming
in all time, and the probability
is that there will be an oil station
erected here for the handling of
the onpla oil, . For several weeks
tiast operators have boon scouring
the country, obtaining leases and
contracting for4 wells, and within
two weeks there will be at least
three more Tigs.' in operation
with others to., follow as fust as
they can bo secured.
