The Galahad of
Ariz(
sona:
Governor Hunt
By Peter Clark MacFarlane
(From Collier's Weekly)
HUNT DOES THE JOB
Now, it is true that some of
these very broad-minded, free
thinking men make complaint
that this great State, with her
great people, has a little governor
big at the girth but small at the
brow. Well, I am not going to
argue that Hunt has the brain of J
a Socrates or even of a Wilson
But 1 will affirm that the man has
a big, clean, honest, sympathetic,
daring heart; that he is an idealist
a sort of Sir Galahad in politics,
always questing for the symbol
of abetter state of things and
of ttimes finding it.
But to get back to his early life
After a time Hunt laid asid e the
apron for the saddle and became
a cowpuncher. A few years more
and he dropped the reata for the,
reins of a delivery wagon in Globe
operated by a general store kr.own
as the OH Dominion. Ten years
later George was the president of
the Old Dominion Commercial
Company. When he took charge
of the company its stock was
worh $100 a share. When he
was forced out of it to punish him
for political treason against the
sacred "interests," it was worth
$1,000 a share about 1,000 per
cent advance.
Efficiency was George's strong
point. The job you gave young
Hunt to do, that job he did.
That was all there was to him
then that and this ha'bit of
whiling away spare hours with
some big, thoughtful book in his
'hand -and that, together with
an extremely sensitive and honest
ly sympathetic nature, is about
all there is to him now. He has
always sought the companionship
of great minds through books,
and out of them he seems to learn
quite a few things that help him
along as governor.
It was in 1893 that Hunt first
broke into politics by way of a
seat in the lower house of the
Territorial Legislature How he
trot into politics I cannot imagine.
A man 10 attract attention in Ari
zona thirty years ago should have
been aggressive. Hunt is timid
A politician in Globe a quarter
. of a century past should have
been a regular "Hello, pard" at
bars and erambling joints. Hunt
was not much at all for bars and
hips and pasteboards and spin
ning marbles. The fellow who
attracted attention and gathered
the votes should have been loud
and boisterous, wearing a
wide-brimmed hat and swagger
Ing all over the street. All any
body can remember about Hunt
twenty-five years ago is that he
was a kind of dude, and dudes
never have been popular in Ari
.zona. But, anyway; Hunt got first
-to the Legislature in 1893, where
Tuning true to form, he proved
,as eccentric a legislator as he
.had been as waiter or cow-
puncher. He was shy, reflective
rpsprvpd. Hp. never made a
speech. But he studied parlia
mentarv nrocedure. did a lot of
circulating, and was really very
,.busy. Whenever a question that
involved humane issues or per
sonal rights against property
rights came up Hunt was sure to
get down on the sympathetic, idea
listic side of it. This meant that
he was usually lined up against
the two great railroads, the Santa
Feand Southern Pacific, which
for years exercised a dominating
influence in the Legislature.
They had their way so completely
that when, at the end of four
years Hun-t took stock of his
achievements for his' constituents
they amounted to just about
nothing. He found he could beat
the corporations in a contest be- j
fore the voters, but that the cor
porations could tie him hand and
foot' in committee rooms and
legislature chambers. So Hunt
left the House for good, with his
maiden speech still undelivered
to which fact I point to prove
my observation that Hunt is
a reserved sort of man.
But Globe refused to be dissat
isfied ivith the achievement of
Hunt. Since he had renounced
the lower house, Globe nominated
him for the upper house, 'called
me lermonai ouuncu,
was elected, serving four years,
He was dissatisfied, however apd
rpHrprl frni-n nolitics for four I
-to-c !
But Globe would not permit him I
to stay out. He was reelected to ,
the upper house in 1905, being!
iiinnAn -f ;Ah a cm-irpri
for six years, until the advent of
Statehood. !
Let us review some of his ex-,
periences during that time. See
ing the futility of trying to make
any progress, he decided that
;here must be some change in the
legislature method, so in 1899
he introduced and passed through
both houses of Legislature a bill
for theinitiative and referendum; !
ij
me governor promptly su-angieu
itiemominiouslv by means of a
pocket veto. Vetoed butnot for
go tt on!
When Globe reelected him,
Hunt reciprocated by trying to
wipe out of existence two of the
:nei; OI
industries. His
town's chief
enemies say he is ungratetui.
In this second term he proved it
and at the same time committed
political hara-kiri in three separ
ate and distinct ways by the
introduction of three separate and
distinct bills.
One raised the saloon license
fee; another forbade the presence
of women in saloons; a third
placed gambling under the ban.
At that time the saloon business
in Arizona was considered almost
in Arizona was consirea aimu,
essential to prosperity nu ,bwu
life of the community. Whoever
made saloon keeping difficult
made civilization difficult and
here was Hunt raising the license
fee! At this time, too a saloon
which was not infested by ver
millioned women was not a first
fln?s saloon and here was Geo.
Hunt blushingly but persistently
bowing the painted ladies out!
ACTUALLY STOPPED GAMBLING
As for erambling it was a learn
ed profession! The houses de
voted to it, with all their para
phernalia of roulette, faro, craps
and the rest of the list, were as
frankly open to the streets as
grocery stores, and as
pompously imposed upon the
most prominent corners, while
lpadintr trambler of the town was
likely to be president of the
Chamber ot Commerce or cnair-
j man of the Board of Trade yet
here was this Hunt person seek
ing by one fell blow to assassinate
this honored profession and drain
the viens of this profitable busi
ness! Moreover, if this position
of the saloon, the frescoed lady,
and the gambling palace was
true of Arizona as a whole, it was
true of Globe in particular; and it
was Globe that had been sending
George Hunt to the Legislature.
But Hunt not only introduced
these bills.- He got them passed
and signed. And maybe jou
think Globe did not put seme
knives on the grindstone. When
Hunt came home from that Legis
lature, men that had been his
friends since the burro-punching
days refused to speak to him.
They charged him with destroy
ing their business and their means
of livelihood, and they set out to
beat him in his campaign for
reelection. They talked very
loudly and ve ry insistently, and
their speeches brought much
applause. Hunt seemed as un
popular in Globe as he does to
day in the State. He was un
doubtedly doomed to defeat. He
thought so himself. He com
posed himself decently for politi
cal interment and awaited, a
voice from the voting" Qooth:
"Duct tr rlnsr nshps to ashes.

Hunt was reelected with more
votes than anybody else on the
Democratic ticket.

Stockmen Confer with Navajo
Indians' About Agreement
for Range
An important conference was
held here this week between the
stockmen and Navajo Indians in
an effort to agree on range rights.
Superintendent Bauman of Black
Rock Indian Agency and repre
senting the Indians, of which
there were about 40 present and
E. Z. Vogt of Ramah represented
the land owners and stockmen.
The charge has been made by the
American stockmen that the
Indians near this place were
seriously interfering with the
settling of the range or using the
range by taxpaying citizens. The
Navajos have a large reservation
where they have good schools and
care by the government and
stockmen herebouts are agitating
the matter of having these In
dians moved back on the reserva
tion or pay taxes as an alterna
tive.
A petition was recently signed
by all the residents of this place
as well as by the ranchmen for
many miles around asking the
secretary" of the Interior to take
steps to move these Indians back
to the reservation. On the for
est reserve the Indians also have
cattle graze over in the forests.
The conference held here re
sulted in Superintendent Bauman
advising the Indians to stay off
the landleased or owned by others
He also ordered those who were
living on other people's land to
move off and further warned
them against cutting down green
pinon trees for feeding their
sheep and
goats on the pine
boughs in case of heavy snows.
One local land owner claims that
one Navajo family destroyed over I
500 pinons on his land this past
winter.
The well known firm of Master
Brothers, incorporated, of Ramah
has dissolved partnership. The
two brothers Giles and R. Creasy
Master, who have conducted a
large mercantile store, ranching
and stock business, have divided
their property. The store will
henceforth be the property of
Giles Master, while their irrigat
ed ranches and stock becomes the
property of R. Creasy Master.
Master Brothers are Englishmen
and have been pioneers in this
part of the state. They are
grandsons of Sir Edward Creasy,
author of "The Rise and Progress
of the British Constitution," and
the better known work. ' 'The
Fifteen Decisive Battles of the.
World."
Farmers and stockmen are
making war on the prairie dogs
or festive tusa, as the natives
I call them. For the first time
(cattle and sheep man are joining
I in their efforts to kill all the dogs
Damage done by these animals
to the crops is immense and with
every succeeding year they have
become more destructive to tne
grass and range. In fact it is
i now asserted that lb) prairie
dogs will eat as much as one cow
or eight sheep.
The government formula is be
ine: used to poison wheat and oats
which is sprinkled in early spring
at the holes of rodents. Quite a
few are killed but persistent ef
fort over a period of years is
necessary to wipe them out en
tirely. A bushel of wheat makes
4,000 doses, and a good rider on
horseback can put 4,000 doses a
day easily from the saddle.
The Ramah public school closes
this week and T. E. Dunlap, the
teacher, will attend normal school
at Silver City during the summer
The contest held in the domestic
Sience department resulted in the
first prize going to Vallie Mowrer
second prize to Menta Davis third
to Jessie James. The prizes, were
given for the best bread, cake
and biscuits exhibited. Gallup

A Symbol of Health.
The Pythagorians of Ancient
Greece ate simple food, practiced
temperance and purity. As a
badge they used the five pointed
star which they regarded as a
symbol of health. A red five point
ed star appears on each package
of Chamberlain's Tablets, and
still fulfills its ancient mission as
a symbol of health. If you are
troubled with indigestion, bili
ousness or constipation, get a
package of these tablets from
your druggist. You will be sur
prised at the quick relief which
they afford. Obtainable every
