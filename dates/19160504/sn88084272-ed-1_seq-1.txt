been selected as the next meeting place.

The extras caused much enthusiasm
among the delegates and was the result
of much good natured jibing on the
part of the different delegates towards
the workers from Fort Worth and Gal

much to do with the delegates de
ciding upon EI Paso 'for the next meet

was unique and never before
