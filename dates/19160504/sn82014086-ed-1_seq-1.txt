100,000 persons employed in various
trades in this city now are on strike,
according to estimates made tonight
and thousands more are threatening to
quit work unless their demands are
met. With shipping virtually at a

NATIONAL CONSERVATION I
.CONGRESS JN SESSION
Advocate of the Shields Water Power
Power Bill Win a Victory.
Washington, May 3. Advocates of
the Shields water power bill, pending
Mn congress, won their fight in the Na
tional Conservation congress today
when the congress voted to adopt a
majority commitee report endorsing
the measure. Gilford Pinchot. who at
the last congress three years ago de
feated a proposal somewhat similar,
vainly oposed today's session.. Charg
es that the convention was packed by
Ihe power interests were made and
denied.
The vote, 116 to 39, came after the
divided committee report had been
debated all afternoon. ' The minority
report opposed endorsement of any
legislation and demanded a declara
tion of principles holding that power
sites shall be retained by the govern
ment and that all water development
hall be under public control.-1
The Pinchot delegates charged that
the congress had been called to create
sentiment favorable to the Shields and
Myers bills and that it did not repre
sent the true conservation sentiment
of the country. Mr. Pinchot declared
special interests were trying to mould
the congress into a lobby for water
power legislation.

the proposal of the. Salvation Army
to bring 5,000 "British war widows with
two children each to Canada after
peace has -been declared are being
worked out here by women of Manito
ba province.
Women of Winnipeg and other cities
have united in protest against the
plan of the Salvation Army and have
denounced it as impractical and un
fair to both the war widows and the
women of Canada.
The cMqt object of the Salvation
Army's proposals is to relieve England
of a portion of the surplus of female
population and to provide opportunity
for the widows to take up homesteads.

Circles Hopeful.
Considerable relief was expressed In

nouncement that the larger companies
probably would follow the lead of the
International Mercantile Marine in ac
ceding to the demands for higher
wages of the longshoremen, 50,000 of
whom threatened to strike. The chief
development of the day in respect to
this class of labor was a strike of sev
eral hundred freight handlers in Jer
sey City. The great difficulty now
confronting them, the employers as
serted, however, was the tieuip of tug'
boats, with approximately 100,000 tons
or freight waiting to be moved.
it was announced tonight that a
committee had been formed to take
up the differences between striking
carpenters and their employers and
that an early adjustment was expect
ed. The statement also was made
that 10,000 painters who walked out

Utmost Expedition.
London. May 3. The announcement
in the house of commons today by the
prime minister that the leaders in the
rebellion In Ireland had been court

oner in the Tower of London, would be
tried with --the utmost expedition.

statement and admitted his error as
chief secretary for Ireland, In un
der-estimating the Sinn Fein move
ment, adding that when he was, in
formed that the insurrection had been
put down he had tendered his reslg
nation to the prime minister and that
it had been accepted.
John Redmond, leader of the Irish
parliamentary party, begged the gov
ernment to be lenient with the great
mass of those . involved in the revolt
and said he was partly to blame for
Mr. Birrell s earlier complacency re
spectuig conditions in Ireland. - as
he had concurred in the secretary's
view that the danger of an outbreak

gram in code reached the war deoart
ment late today from General . Scott
at El Paso, giving a full report on his
conference with General Obregon, the

time the message was decoded, the
Washington government had no offi
cial knowledge of the result of the dis
cusslon between the two military aa
visors, although pres despatches from
the border had said that an under
standing had been reached and dan
ger of a clash with the de facto Mex
lean government removed.
General Scott sent a brief message
today saying that he was preparing a
full report for later transmission to
Secretary Baker. The secretary and
General Bliss, acting chief of staff,

handled by the president personally, it
Is understood, and no step will be
taken without his sanction.

tion to It.
London, May 3, 7.56 p. m. The gov
ernment's military bill for immediate
eneral compulsion passed its first
reading in the house of commons to
night. Its passage was loudly cheer
ed.
The debate revealed no very deadly
opposition to the compulsion bill. The
only interesting point was the sug
gestion by Colon-; Craig that Ireland
snouia be included.
Walter Hume Long.' president of the
local government board, who was
sponsor for the bill, replied to this
suggestion that there was no objection
if the nationalist members approved
the idea and it found an echo in Ire
land. Mr. Long hoped that the bin
would ,be passed next week.

visions of the bill Premier Asqulth
said that- youth's reaching the age d-f
eighteen would be given a month's
grace to enlist voluntary. The same
exemptions would be given as under
the original bill. .

men continuing in civil employment,

service in case of emergency.

bor leaders in the house, expressed a
strong approval or the measure.- He
said that if the country had known
the task in front of the allies eighteen
kmonths ago it would have accepted
compulsory service then.

Saturday afternoon at 4.30, Dodd's

the hills forming the cup in which the
town lies, saw the rear guard of ban

FORMER GOV. BADLWIN
ON UNIVERSAL PEACE.
Would Exclude Recalcitrant State
From Intercourse With Others.
New York, May 3. History indicat
es how a world road to universal
peace might be constructed on the
principle of outlawry and excommu
cation. Former Governor Simeon E.
Baldwin of Connecticut asserted here
today in addressing the World Court
Congress. ,
"All religions." declared air. Jtsaia-
win, "have found excommunication a
pretty drastic remedy. t am, myself,
not satisfied that a reliance on public
faith and public opinion might not be
sufficient unaided to accomplish t
end in view. But if compulsion be
deemed necessary, is there not foir
ground for believing that it can be
better exercised by excluding the re
calcitrant state from Intercourse wit!
her associates than by a resort to
arms?" '
