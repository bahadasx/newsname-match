United States Marine Corps Does
Much to Maintain Peace.
The pastors of a number of or
thodox churches throughout Utah
are co-operating with the United
States Marine Corps recruiting of
ficers in this city in procuring re
cruits for the military-naval
branch of Uncle Sam's fighting
forces.
The clergymen are of the- opin
ion that tho Marine Coi'ps is a
prime factor for peace in control
ling situations which, if badly
handled, might easily lead to war,
and point to the Corps' recent op
erations in Cuba, Ilayti, and Nica
ragua, in proof of this contention.
"The men of the Marine Corps
have done more to avert war in the
last decade than all the peace so
cieties in America," said one of
the clergymen when asked about
his recruiting activities.

Concerning Nothing Very Serious
But Worthy of Thought.
Sympathy may be all right in its
place, but it's a mighty poor sub
stitute for beefsteak if a man is
hungry.
Adequate national defense is the
best peace measure.
Strange as it may seem, the
flowers that bloom in the spring
come back again with the same
beautiful colors, just as though the
war had had no effect on the price
of dyes.
A Chicago woman says "women
should use their needles more."
Quite true, sister, and it would also
help if they would use "noodles"
more.
Oh, yes, and when you can spare
the time go fishing.
Something tells us that in advis
ing the four Mrs. Villas, as we did,
recently in our friendly way, to lay
in a supply of crepe, we shot off our
esteemed mouth too soon.
Carranza seems to be running
his railroad on the block-head sys
tem. The quickest way to get a larger
army and navy is to get some
larger Congressmen.
Descendants of Villas' soldiers
can refer to them as their fore-'run-ners.

Information That Is Worthy of
Consideration to Farmers
and Others.
Quality, quantity, price and the
seasonal tastes all unite in making
this the season of the year when
egg eating becomes the heaviest.
riowever7 they are the best food
that can be eaten at this time as
they arc rich in protein and are a
substitute for meats. Housewives
are urged by dietists to prepare
them fried, boiled, scrambled, or,
poached and to serve them at least
once every day.
Forty-three counties of Ohio
have signed up to conduct boys'
and girls' club work in pig grow
ing, poultry raising, potato grow
ing, and home making. The inter
est in the movement has been in
creasing at a rapid rate, especi
ally since the Agricultural College
Extension Service of Ohio State
University has offered to send
three of the contest winners from
each county to Farmers' "Week
next year. Under the present ar
rangement the club in each county
is carried on by the school super
intendents and fair associations,
with the co-operation of the Exten
sion service of the Ohio State Uni
versity at Columbus. All boys
and girls who enter the contests
Service in the form of bulletins
on raising pigs, poultry, and other
contest projects. They are also
closely connected with a spirited
competition at home. Tho popu
larity of the contests is not only
state-wide, but nation-wide, there
being a national organization of
boys' and girls' clubs.
Navel disease which infects colts
soon after foaling can easily be
prevented by providing clean and
sanitary stalls for the mares and
colts and keeping the stable well
disinfected, according to J. S. Cof
fey of the Animal Husbandly De
partment, Ohio State University.
The disease is easily transmitted
from old bedding, sawdust or
barn-yard scrapings. Only clean
and new straw should be put in
tho stall and a strong solution of
iodine kept handy for bathing the
navel cord of the colt. The first
milk of the maro contains colos
trum, a natural laxative, and is
essential in keeping the young colt
in good condition; therefore,
mares should not be milked before
or soon after foaling. In a few
days both mare and colt can exer
cise in the pasture lot.

Will Not Bo Made Until Postal
Department Investigates.
"No motor routes will be estab
lished in Wood County."
"No proposed change in the ru
ral delivery service in Wood
County will be made unless ap
proved after a personal inspection
by an official of the Post Office
Department."
These statements were made to
Congressman A. W. Overmycr last
week by Honorable James I.
Blakslee, Fourth Assistant Post
master General, as tho result of
protests made by the Congress
man against the proposed rear
rangement of tho rural delivery
service in Wood County and the
receipt of numerous letters and pe
titions from patrons all over the
county protesting against the pro
posed rearrangement, which were
turned over to the Department by
Congressman Overmyer.
Citizens of Wood County have
been "up in arms" since it has
been rumored that the Post Office
Department contemplated a shake
up in the delivery system in the
county, and they at once got busy
and protested to the Congress
man, who in turn took the matter
up with the Fourth Assistant.
Some time ago the Department
gave assurance that there would
be no motor routes established in
Wood County, but admitted that
an extensive re-arrangement of the
present routes was contemplated,
to take effect about June 1st.
Protests against the proposed
changes became so vigorous, how
ever, that the Department has
agreed to suspend all activities
pending an inspection by a De
partment official.

THIS OLDEST BANK IN WOOD COUNTY .
in
Many Parts of tho State.
J. S. Houser, associate entomol
ogist of the Ohio Experiment Sta
tion, snys that tho parent moths
of tlfc canker worm have been ob
served in considerable numbers in
some sections of the State during
the last two weeks and it seems
that this well known insect may
do considerable harm this season.
It -will bo remembered that the
male canker worm moth is a dusky
miller measuring about an inch
across its spread wings and that
tile female is wingless, appearing
somewhat like a spider. The fe
males emerge from the ground and
crawl up tho tree trunks to the
small twigs, where tho eggs are
deposited. With the expanding of
the leaves, the eggs hatch and the
striped measuring worms or cater-'
pillars begin eating the foliage. If
the wfirms are abundant and no
attempt is made to control them,'
the trees may be entirely defoli-1
ated. When the branches are jar
red the caterpillars let themselves '
down by a silken thread. I
The caterpillars are most easily
killed when they are young, there
fore it is important that the in
fested trees be sprayed as soon as
the tiny, newly hatched larvae be
gin feeding, and at this time it is
necessary to observe quite closely
in order to find them. For con
trol purposes use arsenate of lead
paste four pounds, or arsenate of
lead powder two pounds, to each
fifty gallons of water. Special pre
cautions should be taken to thor
oughly spray the tops of the trees,'
since it is there that the most se
vere injury is done.
Not only are apples attacked;
but many of the shade trees as'
well. Of the latter, linden, ehnj
maple, hawthorn and others suf
fer severely.
TAKEN TO PENITENTIARY.
Deputy Sheriff Unkart took Wil
liam Sehier to tho penitentiary
Monday to serve from one to
twenty years for causing the death
of Raymond Pratt, aged eight, at
Perrysburg, in an automobile acci
dent last fall. Sehier 's wife has
brought suit in Lucas county for,
divorce. Friends of Sehier have
secured the services of B. F. James
in his behalf, and Mr. James has
filed a motion for a new trial in
tho case.
