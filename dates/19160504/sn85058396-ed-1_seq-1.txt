Dublin Organizer of the Sinn

Generally Not in Sym

Dublin, Wednesday, May C (De
layed). Justice has been swift In the
ense of the leaders of the Sinn Fein
rebellion. Three of tho ringleaders
signatories of the proclamation of the
short-lived Irish republic, paid the
supreme sacrifice this morning. They
were Patrick H. Poarse, the scholarly
president of the provisional govern
ment, Thomas MacDonagh and Thom
as J. Clark. Their death sentences
were pronounced by the field general
court martial and were duly confirm
ed by tho highest authorities. Of the
other signatories, James Conolly 1b

Dlarmad, Eamonn Ceannt and Joseph
Plunkett are somewhere in Ireland,
whether free or captured, is not pub
licly known.
Other Leaders Being Tried.
The other leaders in custody are
now being tried with great rapidity.
The Associated Press correspondent
saw a batch of tho prisoners leaving
one of tho courts after being sen
tenced. Unless their cheery appear
ance was forced, they evidently had
escaped with more lenient punish
ment than they had expected. The
general public was not aware of tho
execution of tho ringleaders until lato
this evening and it was not possible
to observe the effect of their punish
ment upon the citizens of Dublin,
who however, for the vastly greater
part, were not In sympathy with the
rebellion.
Further captures, of isolated snipers
occurred today in the outlying quar
ters of the capital and orders wore
Issued by Major General Sir John
Maxwell that any rebels found with
arms should bo severely dealt with.
Very few shots have been heard In
the city since Tuesday evening when
a government boat passing down the
Liffey rivor was fired upon and sharp
salvos from machine guns in the vi
cinity of Rathmines caused pcopioj

The south aud west of Ireland are
at present the only places where dis
turbances are rife and these are being
sharply suppressed. Some further
casualties are reported among tho
troops. Though the young soldiers
are performing their duty under the
severest conditions of warfare, many
of them having had only a few
months' training, they are displaying
the utmost bravery, never hesitating
to advance under, the hottest fire. In
several parts of Ireland the Sinn Fein
organization did not take part In tha
outbreak, but as they possess huge
quantities of arms and ammunition,
they are being closely watched. Or

that they immediately surrender all
their arms and in case they do not

that butter sold at 52 a pound, flour
at a dollar a pound and potatoes at
sixty cents.
Since the beginning of the disturb

UNITED STATES WILL ACCEPT MAI I
POINTS OF THE SCOTT AGREEMENT i I
H
Final Conference Between Mexican Minister of War Obregon
and Generals Scott and Funston to Be Held After Ap- fl
proval by Carranza and Wilson Co-operation Pro- M
vided for With Use of Mexican Railroads and M
Withdrawal When All Danger of Border
Raids Is Passed. tH
Washington, May 4. The American
government Is ready to accept In its
main points, the agreement for the
future pursuit of Villa and his ban
dits drawn up by Genoral Obregon,
the Carranza minister of war, and
General Scott, representing the Unit
ed States. This was decided at a con
ference today between Prsldent Wil
son and Secretary Baker.
.Formal announcement of the posl
tlon"of the American government will
not be given out until General Car
ranza has had opportunity to pass on
tho report submitted to him by Gen
eral Obregon. As soon as that 13 done
another conference between Gen. Ob
regon and Gen. Scott will be held on
the border and the negotiations will
be formally concluded. While no of
ficial information has been received
from Gen. Carranza, officials here take
it for granted that Gon. Obregon
would not have made an agreement
which would be unacceptable to his
chief.
Co-Operation Provided For.
The agreement provides for the co
operation of American troops and
Carranza soldiers in clearing north
ern Mexico of bandits. Mexican rail
roads will be utilized for the transpor
tation of supplies for the American
troops. While no time limit is set
for the withdrawal of the American
troopsMrnl.exicQJ.hat'JJlihejjIoiiei
as soon as there are definite indica
tions that American border towns are
no longer in danger of raids.
Agreement is Rev'ewed.
Secretary Baker and President Wil
son reviewed the agreement at length
today and Secretary Baker sent a
message to Gen Scott on the future
conduct of the negotiations.
Officials characterized the agree
ment was "satisfactory" but would
not state whether every detail was
acceptable.
When the negotiations are ended
President Wilson probably will make
a statement.
General Jacinto Trevino, one' of the
conferees at the first conference,
prepared today to leave Juarez for
Terreon, as soon as it became evi
dent that the agreement between Gen
erals Scott and Obregon was satis
factory to both governments. He ex
pects to arrange for the surrender of
the troops of Canute Reyes and im
mediately aftorwards personally di
rect the operations again Villa's men
about Terreon and in the state of
Durango.
Reyes men, who were reported
ready to yield to the de facto govern
ment, have been receiving provisions
sent from General Trevino's head
quarters at Terreon.
Washington, May 4 General Scott's
report on his conferences with. General
Obregon, Carranza's war minister
laid before President Wilson today by
Secretary Baker, was characterized
bv officials as "satisfactory." It Is
understood to provide for the use of
Mexican railways and sets no definite
time such as sixty days as has been
reported for the withdrawal of Gen
eral Pershing's forces.
While the terms of the tentative
agreement will not bo mnde public at
least until after a conference between
Wilson and Secretary Baker, today,
it is understood to provide that Amer
ican troops shall not go farther south
than thev now are and will be with
drawn soon as the Carranza govern
ment convinces the United States of
Its ability to protect the American
border territory. It also provides for
co-operation with Carranza troopslor
cleaning up the bandits. Some slight
changes in the agrement. as made be
tween Generals Scptt and Obregon,
may be made here but they probably
will be unimportant. The indications
are that Secretary Baker will recom
mend to tho president the acceptance
of the agreement which is described
as purely a military one. .
Border Awaits Washington News.
El Paso, May 4. Ratification of the,
tentative agreement reached between
Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief
of staff of the United States array
and General Alvaro Obregon, minister
of war of the de facto government
of Mexico, awaits only the accept
ance by President Wilson of the
terms of the proposed settlement. Ad
vices received in Juarez today indi
cated that First Chief Carranza, had
given his consent to the terms agreed
upon by his .minister of war. The
formal ratification will follow rapidly,
it is expected, as soon as the word
comes from Washington that the
agreement' is satisfactory to tho ad
ministration. General Obregon told his assistants
today that he saw no reason why the
settlement should not be quickly ef
fected and lie believed that the ten
sion between the Mexicans and Amer
icans would quickly disappear when H
the news was spread that an under- IH
standing had been reached that had IH
for its object the retirement of the IH
