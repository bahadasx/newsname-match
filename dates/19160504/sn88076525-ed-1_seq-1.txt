The ar^iy bill which has just passed
the Senate Contains a provision for the
expenditure of fifteen million dollars
for the establishment of water-power
plants for the manufacture of nitrtaes
to be used in the, production of mu

is to be procured by the issuance and
of that sum in Canal bonds.
m.m
The Canal, it .will be remembered,
was constructed at a'cost running into
the htrndredg af millions and was paid
for, largely out of the current receipts
of the Treasury *s provided in the
wise revenue laws for which the Re
publican party stood sponsor. In ef
fect, we Republicans built the Canal
out of the small change in the nation's
purse.
But the Democrats, to find fifteen
millions, have to issue bonds. A bond
issue was confidently predicted as one
of the certain results of a Democratic
administration—and sure enough, it is
to occur. It is the happening of the

Bismarck, April 28.—Local Demo
crats are wondering who spilt the

Minot when McArthur and Platou
were to have so«|4 other juicy plum.
'Pl^iR^b
Platou. has announced that he will
not efcpde-.by the tes^iiif tids-oc$nfer

Just what effect Platou's kicking ov

candidacy is not known. It haa.'been
an open secret for some months that
the Democrats were split into three
factions and the recent deal was put
through in hopes of harmonizing all
factions behind Buxke.
Hellstrom Has Plan.
F. O. Hellstrom has refused all of
fers to eliminate himself in favor of
Buxke. Hellstrom deaclares that he
is in the jacQ to stay and that he be

publicans at the fall election.
CORN IN NORTH DAK. FARMING.
Corn is one of the most wonderful
crops in North Dakota forming. Dean
Henry in discussing corn in his book
"Feeds and Feeding" states that "were
a seedsman to advertise Indian corn
by a new name, recounting its actual
merits while ingeniously concealing
its identity either his words would be
discredited or he would have en unlim
ited demand for the seed of the sup
posed novelty." The corn crop is so
common that its wonderful qualities
are often lost sight of. He continues
"the possibilities of American farms
in the live stock they may cany and
the animal products they may turn off
are restricted only by the quality of
com and clover or other legume (al
falfa for North Dakota) which the
land will produce and this under good
management seems almost unlimited."
Corn is the crop that will really de
velop the possibilities of North Dako
ta farming. It will not only produce
stock food, but it is necessary for
keeping up the grain yields. This is
the year to increase the livestock and
grain growing possibilities of the
North Dakota farm by increasing the
corn acreage. Home grown seed corn
is best. When that cannot be had the
next best is that grown nearest where
it is to be planted. All seed corn
should be carefully tested. If the ger
mination is low plant move so as to
make up for it.—North Dakota Ex
periment Station.

Out of the first seventy names called

the high number holders will complete
their filings.

INTER-OCEAN—VOLUME XXXIII. NUMBER 48
TO BE USED IN BIG FRONTIER,
CELEBRATION HERE IN JUNE,
THESE LONG HORNS SHIPPED IN
FROM TEXAS TO DICKINSON
ESPECIALLY FOR THIS EVENT.
A carload of wild longhorn Mexican
steers will be shipped from Texas soon
to Dickinson to be used in the staging
of the mammouth frontier pageant at
the State Elks' convention oa June
16th and 17th. These steers will be
the wildest that can be ootained,
the Slope cow punchers will have some
job in rounding them up. The mem
bers of the Dickinson lodge of Elks
ate planning for the greatest celebra
tion of the kind ever staged in North
Dakota, and neither time nor money
are being spared in arranging for the
very best in the frontier entertainment
line. Visitors will find themselves
transported from a modem, metro
politan city to the outskirts, where
every indication points to life on the
Dakota plains two or three score years
ago. Dickinson is situated in the
heart of the last great ranching coun
try, and even today the cowboy, equip
ped with chaps and complete frontier
regalia can be seen on the streets of
the city almost any day in the sum
mer. The pioneer ranching methods
are rapidly passing, however, and the
Elks' frontier celebration in June may
be the last to be held in Dickinson.—

That the latest map of North Da
kota, compiled by the Deparement of
Agriculture was issued at a time when
it was most urgently needed, is proved
by the rapidity with which the 50,000.
maps so ordered are being bought by
those who can u£e this method of state
advertising in their business.
These maps were received from the
publishers March 27, this year, and at
this writing, April 22, there axe less
than 3,000 remaining. By ordering in
50,000. lots a special price has been
secured bjjjt Commissioner R. F. Flint
which is less than half the rate that
would be charged in lots of 10,000 or
less. This full reduction has been of
fered to any one who can use lOO or
more maps, and figures out $1.05 per
hundred or multiple thereof, f. o. b.
Bismarck, N. D.
The map speaks for itself and as a
whole constitutes a veritable store-*'
house of information concerning the
State. No one desirous of keeping
posted on the development and resour.
ces of North Dakota should be without
a copy. For a little more than a cent
each, there is no publicity literature
that offers greater value.
Commissioner Hint has placed an
other order for 50,000 with the pub
lishers and will be glad to book orders
at the rates quoted above. First come
first served.
This method of publicity has been
rendered necessary because of the
failure of the legislature to provide
means for the free publication of this
class of literature. Money secured
from the sale of the maps is turned
into the printing fund department.
