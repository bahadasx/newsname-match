LITTLE GOLDIE ROBINSON, ("Sunlocks") GETS A DECENT BURIAL.

SAVED FROM POTTER'S

People of Hayti Show Deep
Sympathy, and Thank St.
Louis for Kindness.
Little "Sunlocks" will not. tiill
a pauper's grave. The poor "Lit
tle Mother" will be buried in
Hayti, Mo., high up on the foot
hills of Pemiscot County, that
she loved. ,
The St. Louis Times told Fri
day of the unclaimed body of (
Goldie Robinson, 11 years old, '
who had given up her life to save
her younger sister from lire.
The article told how, or a week, '
the body had lain in the Morgue
without one single friend, or rol-
'Mvn offering to give it decent'
j u rial. i
Hardly had the edition been oil'
the press when responses of aid '
began to come in. It had struck
a heart chord of sympathy. Poor
little "Sunlocks" will not know, i
but after all, her death has not
been in vajn. Her last word be
retess sisters. Plans are now
under way to adopt both in fine
homes.
Col. Fred C. Gardner, presi
dent of the St. Louis Collin Com
pany, had hardly read the story
when he telephoned to John J.
Kennedy, the keeper of the
Morgue, that he would donate
the tinest coffin to be had for the
little Martyr. Then, came the
offer from a woman offering to
give a deed to a lot in the New
Pickett Cemetery, and that the
grave would always be adorned
with the wild flowers that little
"Sunlocks" called "her own."
! Mrs. Henry R. Weiself, 4548
Westminster place, sent a dona
tion of money. A woman who
' a.sked that her name be withheld,
but who gave the telephone calj
ot "Forest 267," stated she held
1 herself in readiness to pay for a
ii-ave in any cemetery that might
be selected. A messenger
brought a donation from "Mrs.

A well-d rossed woman came to
the Morgue in an automobile.
She broke down and cried when
shown the little form. Then she,
took the address of "Sunlocks"
sisters in Hayti, Mo., and said
she would adopt one and would
endeavor to see that the other
also obtaiued a home. The body
of the little girl was removed to
the mortuary of the Walker-Held-erle

2331 South Broadway, Friday.
It will be sent to Hayti. On her
coffin will rest wild flowers the
kind that little "Sunlocks" used
to call "my own."

A letter was received from
Mrs. Sarah Robinson, a seam
stress, of HI.") North Thirteenth
street, raying she would donate
part of her family burial plot lor
a grave for "Sunlocks."
The children of Morgue Keeper
Kennedy and Coroner Padberg
have volunteered to act as pall-,
bearers in the event in might
finally be decided to bury the lit
tle girl in this city instead of
sending her back to Hayti, Mo.
St. Louis Times.
The remains of little Goldie
Robinson, called "Sunlocks",
who was fatally burned in this
city a short tune ago, were laid
to rest in Woodlawn Cemetery
in this oit.v Monday afternoon
with a burial very appropriate to
the little one. Funeral services
of this unfortunate little girl were
conducted by Rev. J. B, Rags
dale, pastor ol the First Baptist
Church in this city, at 2:510 o'clock
Monday. These services were
very impressive and the words
of Rev. liagsdale were full of
pathos and .sympathy, and when
the services wore concluded
there was scarcely a dry eye to
be seen of thoio present. The
remains were accompanied to the
cemetery by the school children
and a groat number of citizens,
women ana men ot tnis city.
The pallbearers consisted of six
father, her mother being dead,
money was ljberally contributed
o'y the citizens of this city for
the purpose of taking this
little girl to St. Louis, where it
was hoped she might receive
treatment and medical aid and
thereby recover. On arriving in
S. Louis she was taken to St.
Luke's Hospital, where every
thing was done for her that pro
fessional aid could do, but to no
avail. After remaining in the
hospital several days, and no
doubt enduring great agony, she
finally breathed her last and her
little soul took its ilight into that
beautiful world beyond the star.
It is said that her last words
were for her little motherless
four-year-old brother and six-year-old
sister.
It seems that after death, for
the want of someone to take
charge of the remains, her body
was taken to the morgue, where
it remained some seven days.
The facts concerning her death
and the poverty of her father
finally became known to the peo
ple of St. Louis, and at once the
cliarity of a big city manifested
itself. Many good men and
women quickly responded to the
call of need, and sufficient funds
Were immediately donated to
give this little child a decent
burial and to save her from the
potter's field.
i As soon as the com' n and
shroud-could be provided, the
remains were sent to this city
for interment.
J. S. Sturm received from the
people of St. Louis who had in
terested themselves in the burial
of this little girl seventy-nine
dollars and forty-seven cents,
and upon the advice of a
number of our citizens, has
placed this, money in the bank,
to be used for caring for the little
brother and sister of "Sunlocks. "
This was evidently the intention
and purpose of the donors.
This entire community greatly
appreciates the spirit and kind
ness of the good people of St.
Louis in doing wjiat they have in
this matter, and it makes us
know that in the city as well as
in the country there are hearts
that beat for others.
HERALD WINS AGAIN.
The Herald again last Monday
demonstrated that it was in a
position to handle any amount of
work, and was capable of doing
it as well as any print shop in
Pemiscot county.
And as a reward of careful
study in the printing business
and knowing the ends and outs
of the business the Hayti Herald
is now the official county news
paper. That means that In the
Herald will appear all public
printing.
This is the first time in the
history of Pemiscot county that
a newspaper outside of the coun
ty seat ever held the county
printing, and we feel proud of
the fact to so state. There is
nothing too good for our readers,
and we are at all times endeavor
ing to give them all the news
that happens.
This not only gives us more
business but it gives us more
prestige over the county and
community. Those who want to
keep up with the county affairs
will now have to take the Herald,
thus adding several hundred
subscribers to our list. This not
only makes the Herald stronger,
but makes the Herald a better

It Does Make a Difference
Where You Buy Your Drugs
There is no other tine of business which demands
the same spirit of carefulness as the sale of drugs.
This carefulness not only refers to an effort to avoid
errors, but it includes care in buying, handling and
selling of everything a druggist carries.
The mission of the drug business is to safeguard the
interests of the public. To do this properly, constant
care must be exerted.
We are careful, and we seek the trade of customers
who appreciate the fact that care counts.
