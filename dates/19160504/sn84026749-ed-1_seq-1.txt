Milton H. Smith Says Commis
sioners Visited Capitol Seek
ing Increase of Powers.
Charges that the Interstato Commerce
Commission Is Its own lobby before
Congress, seeking additional power.
were made by Milton II. 8mlth, presi
dent of the Louisville and Nashvlllo
railroad, at an Interstate Commerce
commission hearlmr today of chnreea
by Senator Lea of Tennessee, that the
road's practices aro corrupt.
"The commission Is a. political body,
subject to discipline by tho people If It
favors the railroads." said Smith. "If
It does not behave. It will bo abolished
by the people. If the Supreme Court
Itself favored the railroads. It would bo
abolished as tho Commerce Court."
Chairman Meyer, of the commission,
conducting tho hearing, questioned
Smith ns to the "lobby" reference.
"Lobby Isn't a resnectablo word any
more, I suppose," Smith returned. "Per
haps J ought to withdraw It."
Smith persisted that the commission
ers had visited tho Capitol recking ad
ditional power. Ho cited the present
case as anexamplo of what ho Inti
mated to be n working agreement be
tween the commission and Congress.
Resolutions calling for Investigations, ho
said, had been approved by a, unanimous
vote when tho Scnato was practically
deserted.
Smith said ho did not favor a with
drawal of the powers of the commission
to regulate rates. The railroads ond
shippers, he said, had got along very
well before the commission's time.
Joseph W. Folk, chief counsel for tho
commission, wns unsuccessful In nn ef
fort to make Smith state that Henry
Walters, of the Xew Haven, was tho
largest holder of L. fc N. stock, through
the Atlantic Const Line.
Smith expected to bo asked by Polk
about campaign contributions of tho
railroad. E. 8. Jowett, his personnl
counsel, said he would ml vise Smith not
to answer. The commission, he expect
ed to soy, had no authority to Inquire
Into this phase of a railroad's business.

Meyer.

Declaring they consider Its provisions
as unnecessarily drastic the Commission
ers sent to Congress today an adverse
report on the bill Introduced by Senator
Marline to regulate tho thickness of

The bill provides that It shall be un
lawful to erect any brick building over

wall less than thirteen Inches In thick
ness, Interior walls, other than party
walls, excepted.
The building regulations permit smaller

Secretary of War Baker Urges That U.S. Government
Become a Model Employer Says Many Are
Paid Less Than Living Wage.
"The United States Government," declared Secretary of War New
ton D. Baker, "should be the model employer of the country. The
wages it pays and the working hours and conditions of its employes
should serve as an example to private enterprises. While it should
not bo so lenient and generous as to disorganize private enterprises, it
should be a little better than the best of the private employers."
The Secretary made this statement with regard to the effort of
the War Department, under his supervision, to establish reasonable
wage scales in the Government arsenals.
The United States Government is not a model employer. Though
the hours of labor it exacts are not more onerous than the hours of
labor in private industries, it pays wages to its employes in the Dis
trict of Columbia that are, in many instances, barely living wages, and
scores of States and cities, and even private establishments, arc more
thoughtful of the working conditions of their employes.
This is one of the reasons why there is a wealth of argument
behind the efforts of the National League of Government Employes to
persuade President Wilson to grant Saturday half-holidays to the Gov
ernment workers in the District throughout the year, instead of limit
ing these holidays to the summer months.
HOLIDAYS
Thirty-four States and forty-three
municipalities In the United States, by
law or by custom, have decreed that
their employes should get off from work
at noon on Saturday. Many of them
have been giving these Saturday half

of Government Employes, submitted

of the United States Board of Concili

ond offered his services to both parties.
Ho Is now awaiting their answers.
"Thero will be no strike of the tel

Is to be nrranged for today.
Meantime tho railroad is continuing to
gather strikebreakers to take the place
of men who may go out.
Vice President A. T. Hardin, of the
New York Central, said that the road

Women's Club Biennial
Is Not a Style Show.
nSays Capital Leader
Mrs. Court F. Wood Asserts
Delegates Go For Inspiration,
Not For Dress Competition.
LACK OF GOWNS NO BAR
Head of Local Federation Dis
cusses "Tip" Given in Organ
ization Magazine.
"No Washington woman need stay
homo from the federation biennial In
May because she feels that her clothes
are not good enough," said Mrs. Court
F. Wood, president of the Washington
Federation of Women's Clubs, today.
"Most of them aro sensible enough to
know that a tailored suit, with perhaps
an afternoon frock, will see her safely
through any of the meetings, both busi
ness and social.
"Tht-y go to the biennial to get In
spiration, not to compete with other
delegates in dress. Several years ago I
heard of a woman who was much
blamed by her friends because she
went off to a federation biennial with
a tailored suit and a few blouses.
" 'My dear,' they said, cattlshly, when
she roturned, 'didn't you feci well, out of
place, without some dressy frocks?'
" "lire Inspiration of the meeting was
mv chief Interest,' she replied.
Some May Dress Richly.
"To be sure, thero' are delegates who
will dress richly, who have never been
accustomed to dress otherwise, but they
ulll Lw tho exceptions, not tho rule. A
f i lend of mine once said that these tow
pcijplc never used to make her feel
ashamed of her oWn plain suit, because
she found a Joy In Just looking at
dollies more expensive than she could
ever buy.
"A great deal has been said about
tho federation campaign for modesty In
dresi. The delegates aro going to prac
tice what they have been preaching by
wearing simpie, appropriate clothes at
fio meetings, our local branch of the
federation Intends to give no advlco on
the subject to Its delegates. Wo im
agine thev are informed as to what Is
In aooil taste."
Mrs. wood's comment was occasioned
by an editorial In the April number
of the Federation Magaslne- entitled.
"Comet -Dress at-Jilis-Coming Bien
nial." A number of federations in the
various cities have been rather offend
ed at the information given by its
writer. Miss Mary A. Peck, of New
York.
This Is her sartorial advice to dele
gates. Her Satorial Advice.
"Many delegates do not know that
New York women wear only strictly
iallortil things on the street or at
business meetings, and little or no
Jeuelrv. Their suits are usually black
In color Women of the Southland who
chose llaht colors for their spring suits
mav, wear their winter ones, slnco New
York Is always cool In May.
"Thuv need but few changes a good
tailored suit, preferably black, several
blouses, an afternoon frock ond per
haps nn evening cloak. Theso with good
gloves r.nd comfortable shoes will leave
them re.ndy to get Jpy and Inspiration
from the May biennial.
"It Is also advisable to select small
hats. Well dressed women avoid the
Inrgh ones. If they can afford It. tho
mirchaec of a Knox, or Phlpps or Gage
hat will pay In the end. they bemg
suitable for any occasion."
New York Women Aren't
Trying to Dictate Dress
NEW YORK. May 4,-Ifs all a mis
take. New York women nre not trying
tn dictate to club women throughout
the country what they shall wear at
the forthcoming biennial convention of
Federated Clubs.
Following tho npnearance of an
article In tho gonnnl federation's mag
nlne. hlntlng'thnt the fair sox outclde
of Now York State and city had to he
coached on what clothes are In good
taste, a protest arose In many sections.
This protest became so vigorous to
dav that Miss Mary Garrett Hay, mem
ber of tho board of directors nf th
gcnornl federation, issued a flat denial
of anv Intent upon tho part of Nc-v
York club members to coach outsiders
In matters of dress.
"Mercy, no! Porlsh the thought!"
exclaimed Miss Hay. "Amorlcan wom
en, and especially the club women of
the country, have better taste In clothes
than tho women of any other country
In tho world. Thnt ! nnA thlnt li.,t
club work tenches good taste and
sound Judgment in matters .of dress.
"We don't even know tho wtitor of
me article mat started all this discus
sion. The article. I believe In n imlrl
advertisement written In the Interest of
three stores mentioned. The members
of clubs In New York wouldn't think ot
telling or even Intimating that they
had better tasto than women In other
sections. In fact, we can probably got
pointers from outsider."

PLAN OF M
President Ready to Oppose
Agreement Soon as Car
ranza Indorses It.
VILLA HUNT IS TO GO ON
Troops Will Not Be Withdrawn
Finally Until Bandit Is Dead
or in Prison.
Thoroughly satisfactory from tho
standpoint of the American Gov
ernment, the agreement proposed
at the Scott-Obregon conferences
will be accepted by President Wil
son as soon as General Carranra
has had opportunity to examine it.
The full report was submitted to
the President today by Secretary
Baker. It was decided not to
make it public, however, until it
had been approved by.Carranza.
Officials of the Administration
declare that the agreement does
not provide for a withdrawal move
ment at this time, and imposes no
time limit whatever on the pres
ence of the Arterican forces in
Mexico.
EFFECT OF UNDERSTANDING.
The whole effect of the understanding,
they say, is to provide complete co
operation between the forces of the two
governments in tho final suppression of

EL PASO. Tex.. May 4. American
aid In rehabilitating Mexico Is expected
to follow ratification of the "El Paso
peace pact."
War Minister Obregon and Chief of
Staff Scott were silent today awaiting
advices from their respective govern
ments, but developments Indicated
more than military matters were treat
ed In Tuesday's momentous twelve
hour conference.
Authorities here believed the official
statement will show that chief among
the matters agreed upon Is the gradual
retirement of the American punitive
expedition from Mexico the movement
expected to extend over sixty days.
Other features of the agreement are
believed to be:
Contraction of the expedition's line

American troops to be unhampered
In the hunt for Villa, with the Car
ranslstas giving genuine co-operation
south of the zone where the expedi

however, will continue to avoid en

Carranza troops to aid in policing
the district occupied by American
troops.
The United States to ure its good

Carranza forces to resume Importation
of arms and ammunition from 'this
country.
Carranza to take up' the Mexican
mining laws with a view to changing
them by executive order to permit re
opening of the mines and employment
of large numbers of idle Mexicans.
Foreign capital la to be permlted to
return under the new arrangement.

Scott will take up the Mexican civil
problems with Washington and reach
a conclusion conforming substantially
ti the tentative agreement reached with
Obregon.
Authorities here agree Mexico's prob
