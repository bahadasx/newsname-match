LEADERS OF MUM'S
REBELUON SURREMIER
LEADERS GIVE UP AND RANK
AND FILE FOLLOW THEIR
EXAMPLE
London, May 1.—An official an
nouncement was made this afternoon
that all rebel leaders in Dublin had
surrendered.
Dublin, May 1.—Rebels of the rank
and file followed the example of their
leaders and confessed the cause of the
Irish republic was lost by laying down
their arms at the foot of the Parnell
monument in Sackville street and
surrendering to British troops. About
450 of them who fought since Monday
in this central area marched out from
their strongholds under a white flag
and gave themselves up. A few con
tinued sniping froni lairs, difficult to
locate, on roofs, and among the raft
ers of buildings nearby.
James Connolly, one of the leaders
of the uprising, said by government
officials to be a prisoner, is wounded
in the castle. Rebels in the country
districts are also being prevailed up
on to surrender.
A correspondent of the Associated
Press visited the entire area of dis
turbance Sunday. Desolution and de
struction showed how severe was the
fighting. The havoc appears more
extensive than it actually is, owing
to the amount of debris.
Every window of the law courts has
been .shattered. The rebels had held
the building for a week. Valuable
law reference books and furniture
were utilized to barricade windows
and through the interstices between
the bulky volumes the rebels sniped
without cessation day and night and
were fired on in turn until they were
compelled to evacuate the premises.
Houses all around were dented- with
bullet marks. Some of them were
barricaded with thick oak planks.
Today the streets were full of
curious people. They were deprived
of food until the authorities made pro
vision for them. Down CoTkhill and
King Edward streets strong guards
of troops were still in evidence and
every passerby was challenged.

New Athletic* Club
Will Build Courts
The finest* layout of tennis courts
in the state is the aim of the Willis
ton Tennis and Golf Club which
was
recently incorporated. The stockhold
ers include a large number of the ten
nis devotees of the city.
The club has purchased of R. L.
Welliver a quarter of a block of
ground in the northeastern part of
the city and will invest $500. in a
high fence and three clay and cinder
courts. Later a small club house will
be built. The word golf attached to
the name of the club means possibili
ties in that direction in the future.
"Public Stenographer
Three Miles South"
The correspondence of the young
men homesteaders on a certain part
of the Berthold Reservation is likely
to be kept right up to date. There's
a reason. According to her picture
in the Minneapalis Journal Miss Olga
Tennesen, holder of No. 5, is good
looking as well as a good stenog.
A story under a Minneapolis date
line says:
Miss Olga Tennesen, 2439 Eleventh
avenue south, became the world's first
stenographer-farmer when she filed
on the fifth best claim of 700 thrown
open to settlement by the federal gov
ernment in the Fort Berthold reserva
tion, North Dakota.
Miss Tennesen picked one of the
quarter sections lying beside the site
of the new town on the reservation,
and said that while living on the farm
she would do the stenographer work
of the community. When she moves
to her claim to make her home ,in ac
cordance with the agreement with the
government, it will be the second time
in her life that she ever was on a
farm the other time she only stayed
seven days, she said. Miss Tennesen
is a member of the 1907 graduating
class of the South High School, and
entered the Fort Berthold land draw
ing when she went to Minot
pleasure trip last falL
HEWEST BATTLESHIP
LATEST SUPERDREADNA UHT OF
U. S. NAVY PUT INTO
COMMISSION
Philadelphia, May 2.—The Oklaho
ma, the latest oil burning super
dreadnaught added to the United
States navy, was placed in commis
sion at the Philadelphia navy yards
today. The ship is commanded by
Captain Roger Wells and that her
complement consists of 50 officers and
800 men.
The huge warship steamed to the
navy yards this morning from the
New York Ship company's plant,
where she was built. She was greeted
by a volley of blasts from tugs and
other passing craft. The vessel is ca
pable of making 20 1-2 knots an hour
with her 25,000 horse power engine.
Her displacement is 27,500 tons, and
she measures 583 feet from tow to
stern.
Her main armament consists of ten
14-inch breach loading guns mounted
in four turrets.
THE PIXIES SPLENDID
The Pixie play, or cantata, given
last Thursday evening at the Armory,
by about 150 children of the schools,
proved a brilliant success. Exceed
ingly pretty and entertaining through
the artless art and grace of child
hood, the performance was a credit
to the schools and those who directed
and trained the children.
The patronage was so good and the
public so appreciative that there has
been some consideration of a repeti
tion. The Pixie spectacle was an
other demonstration of the value of
a play house of the ample stage and
auditorium capacity afforded by the
Armory. The good attendance brot
the schools receipts of about $300.

terests in both counties of district.
He should be very acceptable man
for a place on our deligation.

MANY PLAYERS WANT TO GET
ON WITH WILLISTON—TRAIN
ING BEGINS SOON
Playing Manager Clarence T. Mar
shall, who will have charge of the
coaching and team building work of
Williston's 1916 base ball affairs, ar
rived from Rock Island, 111., last
evening. The "Big Boy" as they call
him where he is well known in base
ball circles has been working out with
the Rock Island squpd and is in fine
condition. Before leaving he was ac
corded the privilege of pitching the
opening game of the Three I league
season for Rock Island against Mo
line. The R. I. team lost the game,
2 to 0, but it was not the fault of
their boxman as the score shows.
The base ball board will meet to
night and compare notes with the
new manager with a view to getting
busy on training season work. A
large bunch of local material is in
sight and several players from a dis
tance have indicated that they are
coming to Williston to take a chance
on -making good.
J. W. Jackson, financial member of
the board, was out with a committee
of "experts" this week and met with
splendid response on the part of the
fans and friends of the game. The
ground was not much more than half
covered but will be completed soon.
Voluntary subscriptions to the fund
by persons whom the committee
might not feel at liberty to approach,
or who might be overlooked, will be
thankfully received. We will need a
strong team this season for they are
framing up all along the line and re
quests for future date are coming in.
The base ball name election goes
merrily on. Don't forget to vote and
help select a name to be hitched onto
the 1916 team. Ballot boxes at all
three drug stores Equal suffrage is
in force. The polls close next Mon

The open season after which pike
can be legally taken is May 15th and
those interested in fish protection
wish the date brought to the atten

in the Little Muddy and if given a
chance to spawn will afford good sport
for devotees of the rod.

IS NEARLY COMPLETE
President R. .Calderwood of the
Missouri River Bridge Co., accom
panied by Engineer H. R. Evans went
to Wolf Point, Mont., Saturday and
were shown the bridge that was put
in at that point last season. The
bridge is pronounccd a success in
every way, including financially. A
large Saturday traffic was passing
over it—among other things a seven
ton tractor crossed without the slight
est difficulty or danger so far as could
be observed. The method of guying
the bridge and other essential fea
tures were carcfully noted.
Sunday Mr. Calderwood and Mr.
Evans returned as far a§ Mondak and
were there met by two cars of Wil
liston men, including Mr. Wegley, Mr.
Hydle, Mr. Westergaard, Mr. Win
gate, Captain Bailey and others. The
Mondak bridge is nearly completed.
It differs in some features from the
Wolf Point structure and the two
methods were .compared and discuss

The local bridge company is holding
frequent meetings and preparing to
begin the work of actual construction
at an early date.
Club Busy With Work

A meeting of the officers of the Bur
dick For Governor Club was held Sat
urday night. A plan for a vigorous
campaign that will cover the state
like a blanket was formulated and or
ganization to carry it forward com
pleted. Information gathered from
all parts of the state indicates that an
energetic campaign will make Mr.
Burdick's nomination certain. The
morf candidates who enter the field
the better for Mr. Burdick's chances
is the way the club feels about the
matter, for he is personally the most
popular, is conceded to be the logical
man for the office, and can hold his
individual strength against all comers.
Mr. Burdick departed Sunday to fill
a long list of requested speaking dates
in the central and southern part of
the state.
Builds Extension
On Furniture Store
P. C. Hamre is building a 40 foot
addition to the rear of his furniture
store on east Broadway. That the
already large building and basement
was inadequate for the demands of his
business indicates the rapidity with
which Mr. Hamre is extending his
trade.
THE BAND'S MASK BALL
Friday evening was the occasion of
the first mask ball given in the Arm
ory-Auditorium and a large number
availed themselves of the opportunity
to join in the gaiety and were reward

F. E. Becker Buys
Partner's Interest
May 1st F. E. Becker became sole
proprietor of the Williston Steam
Laundry, having purchased the inter
est of his partner, G. H. Merrifield.
Under the management of these gen
tlemen the business of the laundry
has grown to large proportions, made
up of both city patronage and basket
business, attracted by the excellent
quality of work turned out. The large
force of skilled help employed makes
the concern one that adds materially
to the city's total pay roll.
Mr. Merrifield's future plans have
not been learned.
Candidates Slow
With Advertising
Secretary of State Hall reports
that up to date not a single candidate
has filed his manuscript for the pub
licity pamphlet. He calls attention
to the fact that. the time has been
shortened ten days, and it is pos
sible that some may be laboring
under the idea that there is more
time than there really is. The last
day upon which copy for the pamphlet
can be received by the secretary of
state is May 9 and Hall says positive
ly none will be received after that
date. This is less than three weeks,
and while this is a sufficient length
of time, yet he calls attention to the
shortened time in order that none
may be mistaken.
The state pamphlet is mailed to
every voter in the state. County and
legislative candidates may avail
themselves of the service. The state
"Blue Book" gives prices and other
information.
GERMAN ATTACK AT

DODO'S CAVALRY STDP
MEXICANS AT PASS
WASHINGTON WAITING FOR RE
PORT FROM SCOTT ON
CONFERENCE
Douglas, Ariz., May 3.—An attempt
by a body of de facto cavalry, the ad
vance guard of General Armulfo Go
mez, to enter Chihuahua ,through
Pulpito pass was blocked today by
American troops according to a re
liable report received here from
American sources.
The Mexicans, according to the re
ports, were under the command of
Colonel Jesus Maria Augierre and had
peneti-ated 18 miles into the pass be
fore their movement was discovered
by a United States military aeroplane
which reported the presence of the
de facto troops to the American com
mander.
In Strong Position
The American troops are said to
have been drawn up in a strategic po
sition to hold the pass and Colonel
Aguierre did not attempt to press
forward but went into camp and dis
patched messages to the rear, pre
sumably to communicate with General
Gomez.
Washington, May 2—Developments
here in the Mexican situation await
ed tonight advices from General
Scott as to his further conferences
with General Obregon at El Paso.
The war department has received no
report whatever from the chief of
staff up to a late hour.
Administration officials declared the
situation to be unchanged in any re
spect after President Wilson and his
cabinet had conferred at the regular
Tuesday meeting.
There was no indication tonight of
any change in the determination of
President Wilson not to accept any
proposal of the Carranza government
conditioned on the immediate with
drawal of the American forces in
Mexico.
Promises Big Army
From Mexican sources it was
learned today that, based upon the
immediate withdrawal of the Ameri
can troops, General Carranza has of

CAUSE FOI COMER!
GERIAN SITUATKK
TOO MUCH TIME CONSUMED IK
PREPARING THEIR ANSWER
TO OUR DEMANDS
Washington, May 2.—Two week*
have passed since the United States
dispatched to Germany its note de
manding that an abandonment of pres
ent methods of submarine warfare
immediately be declared and effec
tive, and tonight the state depart
ment was still without and definite
information indicating that the de
mand would be complied with.
Grave Concern
As the days go by and no reply
conies from Berlin and Ambassador
Gerard sends no word regarding the
attitude of the German government,
an air of grave concern is beginning
to manifest itself in administration
circles.
Public officials continue to preserve
an air of optimism. Privately no at
tempt is made to conceal a contrary
feeling, and the feeling is certain to
become more pronounced unless some
definite news is forthcoming over
night.
No Simple Response
It is felt here that the very length
of time which has been consumed by
the German government in preparing
a reply in itself indicates that the
communication will not take the
shape of a simple response to the di
rect and clear cut issue raised in the
American note. It is feared that the
reply is likely to assume an argu
mentative character, which scarcely*
can be regarded as meeting the re
quirements of the United States..
No Decision
Berlin, via London, May 2.—Herr
Von Jagow, the foreign minister, at
the reopening of the sitting of the
budget committee of the Reistag to
day, said the government had not
reached a decision with regard to the
situation that has arisen from the
American note to Germany regarding
Germany's submarine campaign. As
soon as the imperial chancelor returns
from headquarters, Herr Von Jagow
added, he would give the committer
definite instructions.
Treasurer Takes Part
Berlin, via London, May 2.—It has
been learned that Dr. Karl Helfferich,
the imperial treasurer, is at head
quarters participating in the con
ferences on the American note, and
the framing of an answer thereto.
The Frankfurter Zeitung says Am
bassador Gerard twice dined with Em
peror William and that he also was
able to see a German post at an im
portant point on the front.

pansies there in the shade, and:
plant some kind of a tree.
