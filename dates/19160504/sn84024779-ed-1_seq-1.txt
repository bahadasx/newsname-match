People
Hattie Summers of Charles City, Iowa,
Mabel have asked the city council for
a franchise for the right, to con
struct and operate a gas plant in
this city. At. the same time they
made aplicalion to the Breeken

leges.
These men are experienced in
their line and understand their
business from the ground up. This
information we have gathered
from people in this city that have
known the two above mentioned
gentlemen for ft long time and al
so fell us that they are a credit to
any city wherever they locate, be
ing progressive and wide-awake
business men. This is the first
time that our city has been put up
to a gas proposition, but- these
men state that should Breeken
ridge give them the franchise and
Wahpeton the same, then it will
pay.
They propose in their applica
tion for a franchise to put in a
$50,000 plant and to commence
the laying of pipes within 6
months after the passage of tlx:
the rates proposed to be in pro
portion to those of other cities
hjving approximately l.he same
which the gas was used.
They
reserve the right to
charge a meter rental in cases
where the consumption will am
ount to less than 50c per month,
so that the minimum charge will
be 50c per month. They agree that
in case they fail to carry out any
conditions of the franchise, the
same shall become void at once.
The Breekenridge council has
already given it, its first and sec

the election will be held, is not yet

THE WAHPETON TIMES
WAHPETON, RICHLAND COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY MAY 4th, 1916
WE WILL PAYE
DAKOTA AYENUE
So Says the Consensus of Signers
of the Dakota Avenue Prop
erty Owners
WILL BE SOME TIME YET
Before the Actual Paving Can Be
Done But Nevertheless it
Will Be A Reality
The paving of Dakota avenue
has again become a live question
in the minds of our citizens. Dur
ing the past week Mayor Fligel
inan interviewed the property
owners on the street and many of
them signed a petition asking the
city council to pave.
This petition will be presented1
to
the city council at their next
meeting-, and should they trailt
the petition as asked, it will mean
much preliminary work, such as
having all properly on the street
in the paving district connected
1o
the water and sewer systems.
The preparations will all be
made this year and have every
thing ready for the paving next
summer.
Mayor Fligelnian has had in
vestigations made into the cost of
different kinds of paving and as
sures the people of Wahpeton
that a good brick paving on a ce
nie.nt foundation can be put in at
a cost not to exceed $10.00 per
front foot to property owners.
Nearly every spring, when the
frost was going out, we have talk
ed paving for more than twenty
years. This question like every
other improvement or reform has
had its advocates and opponents.
This question has progressed so
far with us now that there ap
pears to be but little active oppo
sition at this time.
The matter has been presented
this time in a business like man
ner, by first determining the kind
of paving wanted for our needs
and its cost.
The following are a list of the
property owners that have asked
to have the paving done from the
river to 8th street.

to cold weather and rain and the
spring floods this year, neverthe
less at the present lime the far
mers are hurrying up their spring
work.
Where the land is possible to
work the ground is in excellent
condition for seeding and drag

that is, within a radius of a few
miles not much has been done,
but farther back from the river
and up in the Galchutt and Ab

land is somewhat lighter than
right here at Wahpeton a large

nialI grain has been sown.
Further to west along the N. P.
and Great Northern much work
has been done and with a good
growing season from now on it
won't take long for grain to catch
up to where it should be.
If course down along the Bois
de Sioux there are still several wet
places and it may fake some time
yet before this land can be work

pleasant weather from now on
about the usual acreage will

ject of the plan is to furnish an
opportunity for Indian boys and
girls to acquire proficiency in the
use of English and to learn the
customs of civilized
homes.
The
Commissioner of Indian Afl'air%
has suggested the advisability of
adopting this plan at the Wahpe
ton Indian school.
School will close about the mid
dle of June and should there be
a demand for boys or girls to go
into homes of well-to-do farmers
of this community, arrangements
can be made towards carrying out
the plan. Pupils should go to
homes where the influence sur

best and where they will receive
care and instruction, similar to
what a parent would give to their
own children.
The Indian Ofl'ic« requires a
representative from the Indian
School to visit these pupils from
time to time in order to be sure
that they are doing their part and
on the other hand are receiving
