Twenty years ago we took eight rolls
of butter to a Hood River house and receiv
ed one sack of flour for it in trade. That
was costly flour and we resolved to trade
' 'no more". If the merchant could sell our
product, we would have it put in dollars
and cents. We have stood to it all those
long years. And when your merchant sells
you any of our products you may be sure
it is all right, because he had to pay good
money for it. He did not have to take it
to please us or square up an old account.
He buys our products and sell them because
his customers know that they receive real
value in Koberg's Non-Pareil Vegetables.

Bank Advertisement No. 87
"It ought to appear from the foregoing that
the banking system is something more in the
community than a mere private enterprise, and
also that the help a bank affords the right kind
of a customer is of immense value, and that
about the first step towards the achievements of
any business success lies in forming a strong and
close association with a carefully selected bank,
and in making one's business and friendly co-operation
of sufficient value to the bank to entitle
one to the full benefit of its facilities. In prac
tice about all that is necessary tathis is the keep
ing of a desirable deposit account. A small
stream of money merely 'put through' the ac
count will hardly do this. In fact, it merejy makes
additional expense. A small balance on deposit,
averaging say one hundred dollars or less, usual
ly costs the bank more than it earns, though
banks seldom refuse to carry these accounts, be
cause they often develop and also often attract
others that are of value. A small deposit ac
count, in itself, however, is not a benefit to the
bank, especially if numerous checks and deposits
are made on it But, in general, the most sub
stantial balance the customer can keep on de
posit, coupled with scrupulously frank, punctual
and honorable dealings, and a spirit of friendly
co-operation to advance the bank's growth,
strength and usefulness, should insure to the
custdlners all the advantages of a bank associa
tion that are here discussed."

CASCADES IS
OLD LANDMARK
RAPIDS BARRED PASSAGE OF BOATS
Construction of Columbia River Highway
Relieves Isolation of Community
Long Without Wagon Road
The mention of the' cascades and
Cascade Locks in former year has no
doubt brought to your mind thoughts
of the Columbia river; for the cascades
form a landmark in the gorge of the
northwestern waterway. The voyag
eurs of Captain John McLaughlin, af
ter tbey had skillfully sped down the
space of nairow whirling waters there,
told of the daring in their chansons.
And bow often haa the stow of those
dangerous rapids been told around ' the
firesides of Oregon's pioneers. A dec
ade ago the canal around the Cascades
was completed and the lockgates in
stalled to lift steamers over the river's
barrier, placed there, if we would be
lieve the legends of the Indians, by
the fall of the mighty arches of the
Bridge of the Gods. And thus the lit
tle picturesque town in the very heart
of the Cascade mountains was given
the name or Cascade Locks, a name
fully significant to the inland navi
gator. Cascade Locks is on the line of the
O.-W. RAN. Co., and until the rail
line was completed in 1882. residents
of the community had been privileged
to travel to Hood Kiver and Ihe Dalles
by the old state road, portions of the
retaining wall of which remain on
Shell Rock mountain. The old walls
are now the home of porcupines, pine
squirrels and chipmunks. All that is
left of works actuated by pioneer as
piration, we can Imagine these falling
walls as tombs of the old road. In
spring the delicate pink blossoms of
wild currant bushes that have sprung
from the mossy crevices, the old cold
of the Oregon grape and the silver?
flowers of dogwood, and in fall the va
rious tints of wild shrubs' foliage,
etched by frost, all pay nature's trib
ute to the memory of the pioneer road
builder.
For more than quarter of a century
Cascade Locks has been denied egress
to the outside world except by river
boat er over the railway line. A Cas
cade Locks resident might own a sad
dle horse or an automobile. But until
last year, when the Columbia river
highway was opened, he could canter
or motor only over a short stretch of
road between his home town and Wy-
eth. To the east and to the west the
jutting cliffs of the grest canyon ex
tended to the very edge 01 trie railway
track and turned back vehicles. For
more than a quarter of a century Cas
cade Locks men and women, it is de
clared, have been dreaming of high
way. Tbey have taken a pride in the
little stretch of road possible to them,
and it was as well graded and taken
care of as though it led to a populous
center. The people of no community
from Astoria to Pendleton rejoiced
more sincerely at the opening of the
Columbia river highway than those of
Cascade Locks.
In pioneer days every prospective
settler who traveled across the nlains
and thence down the Columbia to the
Willamette valley was forced to make
the portage at the Cascades. Passen
gers on the early.river boats, too, will
remember it for the portage and the
surrounding points of scenic grandeur
on a gigantic scale. The passengers of
the U.-W. K. St M. line and tne jNortn
Bank line, which runs below the cas
cades but a stone's throw away from
the rail line of the south bank, recall
the towering cliffs on either side of
the river and the whirling rapids of
the stream itself.
To the leisurely motorist, traveling
through the Cascade Locks community,
varying moods may come and go. At
points on the highway, where a sheer
wall of the gorge rises on the south
and an opening in the forests permits
an expansive view of the Columbia and
the north shore, he may ce exalted.
But a few hundred rods away, and be
is buried in a sylvan quiet, tall forest
trees swaying over the lesser growth
of underbrush. A rlppilng brook adds
an idyllic touch to the picture. The
traveler can shake off that sense 01
awe produced by the vastnesa of pro
portions at the more scenic attractions,
and sensing the heavy restful perfume
of the earth, be contented to dream
there awhile.
Although State Engineer Lewis was
recently reported to have declared the
legendary "Bridge of the Gods of tne
Indians a myth: that no physical or
geological evidence was at hand to
support a belief in the old tale, it is
difficult for one after reading the stor
ies that have been collected by John
H. Williams and "The Bridge of the
Gods, "by Fredric Homer Batch, not to
picture at some eaner eentury tne
huge span of stone that formed a con
tinuous chain in the Cascades and
made an arch over Wauna, the great
river. In the Indian legend the district
of the Cascades was one of importance
both to deity and mortal. Wauna
flowed deep between the country of
the Klicitats and Multnomahs. But
that the people might always be
friendly Saghalie, ,tbe chief god, built
a bridge of atone .over the stream.
Loowit, a witch woman, resided on top
of the great arch and stood custodian
of the only Are in the world. The wom
an saw the misery of human beings
without fire, and at ber persuasion the
Indians were permitted to come and
eet a brand from the blazing heap
guarded by the witch. Saghalie was so
well pleased mat ne promineu me
woman anything sne migni oesire,
Ahe sDoke for vouth and beauty.
It followed that many cnieis saw me
beautiful! woman and immediately leu
in love with her, among the wooers be
in Klickitat from the north and Wi
yeast from the west Loowit hesitated
betweea these two, who grew jealous
and plunged their tribesmen into a
deadly war. Saghalie grew angry and
as a. punishment broke the areb of the
ereat bridee. Wiyeast was changed
into Mount Hood, Klickitat became
Mount Adasas and Loowit the great
symmetrical snow beak. Mount St.
Helen. And today one can sea off to
the north of Cascade Locks the sheer
sides of a basalt formation called the
abutments of the Bridge of the Gods.
Because of the impossibility of navi
gating the eascsdea and the necessary
nortase at the point on the Columbia,
a settlement sprang up there before
1850. While awaiting a boat at Cas
cade Locks, Mrs. Nathaniel Cos, wife
of Hood River's first permanent set
tler, pared a nan of apples for a resi
dent Housewife for the seeds of the
fruit. These seeds, planted later on
Mr. Coe'a donstion land claim, now a
portion of the city of Hood River.grew
to be the forebears of the thousands of
acres of orchards the blossoms of which
have so recently attracted the atten
tion or visitors to the Apple Valley.
On March 26. 1856. the settlement of
the Cascades was attacked by Klickitat
and Yakima Indians, This is known in
history of the northwest as the massa
cre of the Cascsdes. The residents of
the oionecr community barred them
selves in their homes and fought 4ali-
ntly. They were finally rescued by a
little steamer and taken to The Dalles.
The settlers of every mid-Columbia
landing were terrorised. All homes on
the Washington side of the river were
abandoned to the painted warriors, who
pillaged them and applied the torch.
The uprising was finally quelled by
troops from The Dalles.
Aa the demands of transportation
grew it was decided too build a short
railway around the cascades. The fare
on thia short stretch of about a mile
was greater tbsn the sum charged to
day for a ticket from Portland to The
Dalles.
LAST CLAUSE OF
UNIFORM CONTRACT
The last clause of the "uniform con
tract." as provided in the Fruit Grow
ers Agency, Incorporated, providing
that "advancements shall in no case be
made such as to psss title to the fruit,"
has been the stumbling block that has
prevented the Apple Growers Associa
tion from an affiliation with the move
ment. Ihe clause included, it is said, in the
contract to prevent a violation of the
Sherman anti-trust law. Associations
formed in the nature of the Apple
Growers Association have hesitated to
join the organization without the most
minute consideration of the effects of
the contract from all angles. It has
been feared that the clause would not
allow the sales organization desiring to
make loans for financing its members
would not be able to pledge fruit under
its control as security.
In a telegram to Geerge E. Hardy.
secretary of the Portland Chamber of
Commerce, Chas. J. Brand, chief of the
Office of Markets of the United States
department of agriculture, covers this
point as follows:
'Uniform contract does not leave ul
timate accounting with grower. Under
uniform contract any grower's contract
with his association such as used by
Apple Growers Association of Hood
Kiver, Oregon, may be amended in such
manner as to make all the fruit grown
by such member liable for the payment
of any indebtedness which the associa
tion is authorized to contract in order
to make advancements to its members.
The grower's agreement that a lien
shall exist upon his fruit to secure the
association indebtedness fully accom
plishes this purpose. The distinction
is found in the fact that the grower
creates a lien on bis product rather
than makes a sale of same. A sale
thereof strips him of all control over
the product. A lien thereon leaves
some control over it in the grower.
The lien theory, however, furnishes
the lender fully as much security as
does the sale theory. There are legal
and economic reasons of a vital char
acter which make it necessary to insist
upon the lien theory rather than the
absolute sale theory. Any Oregon law
yer will be able to explain the differ
ence and no doubt will convince you
that the bank security is just as good
under the lien theory as under the ab
solute sale theory."
ASS'N HESITATES ON
JOINING NEW AGENCY
While it is the sentiment of the
growers and members of the board of
directors of the Apple Growers Associ
ation, according to A. w. atone, to
subscribe to the cooperative movement
of northwestern apple growers through
the f ruit Growers' Agency, inc., as
established under government super
vision with headquarters at Spokane,
to such a degree as is consistent with
existing contracts between the organ
ization and its members, the Associa
tion has hesitated to align itself with
the new organization because of objec
tions to clauses of the proposed "uni
form contract."
"The matter is up for consideration
by our board of directors," says Mr.
Stone. "It is felt at the present time
thst we cannot conform to the 'uni
form contract' without some change.
since it is in seeming conflict with the
basic principles of our organization, a
strictly cooperative one. We are giv
ing the most serious thought to the
last clause of the contract, which per
tains to the title of the fruit, and are
endeavoring to find a way to make it
barmoniza with our own form at or
ganisation. Up to the present time no
final decision has been made, but tne
matter is still being considered."

GOOD ROADS
DAY RESERVED
CREWS CARRIED TO WORK IN AUTOS
Columbia River Highway is Now in the
Rest Condition Since Route was
Opened Last Year
When the sun set in the Columbia
river gorge Tuesday evening a string
of a score of automobiles, loaded with
about 50 Hood River business men and
orchardists from all parts of the valley.
roiled over the ooiumDia river highway
from the Multnomah county line to this
city, .the occupants of the cars nursing
sore muscles and blistered bands and
at the same time congratulating them
selves on their accompliahents of the
day.
Ihe Columbia river highway Thurs
day night wss in better condition than
at any time since it was opened. The
crews of amateur road men, armed with
rakes, hoes and shovels, hsve covered
every portion of the road. Every loose
stone, such as might cause injury to
tha tires of an automobile or that
might cause discomfort by bumping the
occupants of a car, has been removed.
All ruts and holes have been filled and
crewa of men under supervisors, S. W.
Curran, W. D. Trotter and Warren
Miller, of the districts of the county
through which the Columbia river high
way passes, trimmed down the most
ifncult rough points.
The road work was conducted on the
old principle of ride and tie, used by
pioneer travelers in early days. Where
two travelers had but one pony, one
would ride two miles and tie up the
horse, which would be mounted by the
pedestrian on his arrival at the point
were the nag was bitched. The latter
would then overake his partner, ride
ahead of him about a mile and tie up,
beginning again his walking. The first
automobile load of road workers stopped
just outside of the city limits. The
second proceeded for another mile, and
so on until all were busy. When the
first machine's workers had eome to
the point where the second had begun,
tho machine was sent ahead again to
the vanguard of the good roads day la
borers. When the first carload of tired road
men reached Cascade Locks they were
given an ovation by the people of that
little town in.the midst of the Cascade
mountains with the abutments of the
Bridge of the Gods arising on either
side of the Columbia. The Cascade
Locks people, too, were out in num
bers, assisting in the improvement of
the road which after a period of 25
years has again given them an outlet
to the outside world by wagon road.
The following citizens furnished au
