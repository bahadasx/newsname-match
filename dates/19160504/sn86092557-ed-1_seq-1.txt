BUSY TERM AHEAD
for mmmi
I Twenty Three Cases on Re
vised Intermediate
Court Docket.
The rovlsed docket of the May term
of the Intermediate court was an
nounced today by Judge George Viu
cent, and the present session of the
court promises to be the busiest of
several terms. The criminal docket
1 will first occupy tho jury when the
jurors report Monday morning and 23
I cases on this docket arc set tor trial.
Some of these may be continued, how
ever, aud it is likely that four or five
of the defendants may confess and
waive trial. Just which case will be
tried first cannot be determined un
til the attorneys and the sheriff report
as to their witnesses. The prosecuting
attorney is working hard and will like
ly be prepared to try am cases that
may be ready.
The three misdemeanors on the
docket against Andrew Jones, colored,
were dismissed on the motion of Pros
ecuting Attorney Haggerty. Jones was
convicted of a felony and Is now serv
ing a term in the state penitentiary,
and for this reason it was useless to
try these indictments. All of the cases
on the revised criminal docket are set
for May 8, and the work of disposing
of these will likely consume several
days.
Seven cases on the civil docket that
require juries are set for May 11 but
it is not probably that the criminal
docket can be furnished by that time.
These with the remainder o the civil
cases that are ready and will require
juries will follow the disposal of the
criminal docket in the regular order,
i A number of motions in civil cases
are to be argued the remainder of this
! week before the ? jurors report.
Twelvo judgments have already been
entered in a like number of cases in
j which the First National Bail: of Fair
mont is the plaintiff. In each of these
the bank received Judgment for the
various. sums that were asked for as
none of the defendants contested the
actions. One more case \n which the
First National Bank is the plaintiff
will probably be heard this week.
Of the twentv-four petitions for nat
uralization that wpre heard by the
court yesterday twelve of the men re
ceived their final papers and are now
legal citizens. Two of the petitions
wiere dismissed and the remainder con
tinued for another hearing. Jotin Sev

and Wilmot Eardleyr being the; ones
who received their final certificates.
Because of tho raised requirments It
Is very difficult for the average alien
