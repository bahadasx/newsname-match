SUDDEN DEATH OF A LITTLE ONE.
Word was received here Monday of
the death of the little six year old son
of Mr. Vera Shockley. which occurred
at Woodward that day. Mrs Shock
ley and children had gone to Mutual
only last week on a visit to Mrs.Shock
ley's mother, and at that time the
child seemed to be in his usual good
health. He was taken suddenly 111 af
ter reaching the home of his grand
mother, and thlrking that the trouble
as appendicitis, the child was taken
to Woodward for an operation. Upon
reaching the hospital the doctor in
charge found that tho trouble was not
appendicitis, but was unable to deter
mine the nature ot his Illness, and
could do nothing to relieve him.
Death released him from his sufferings
a few hours later.
The remains were brought back by
auto from Mutual to Balko for inter
ment, and funeral services were con
ducted Wednesday at 10 o'clock a. m.
The many friends of Mrs. Shockley,
both here and at Balko, deeply sympa
thize with her in her bereavement.
GRADE SCHOOL CLOSES.
On last Friday the grades of the Bea
ver schools closed. Thursday evening
the children of the Primary and Inter
mediate grades presented a well plan
ned and suitable program at the Chris
tian church, to which the patrons were
invited. The program was exceeding
ly well rendered, and many favorable
comments were heard. The only un
pleasant featurt of the evening was
tho absence of Miss Helen Murphy,
teacher of tho second and third grades, I
who was called home a few days pre-
vious on account of the death of her
mother. Patrons and pupils sincerely
regretted her absence and the sorrow
which came to her so suddenly and un-
expected.
HIGH SCHOOL PLAY AND 8TH GRADE
COMMENCEMENT.
The public was entertained at the
Globe Saturday" night by the Eighth
Grade Commencement exercises and a
High School play entitled, "Catching
Clara." The play was admirably pre
sented, each member of the cast por
traying the character assumed in true
Thespian style. The graduating class,
as well, did, credit to themselves and
we are proud of the ability displayed
by our students, both in the class room
and elsewhere. Twenty-seven Eighth
Grade graduates bespeaks the quality
of the work done by the pupils.
A QUIET WEDDING.
A wedding occurred week before last
which escaped newspaper mention, and
the high contracting parties keeping
the matter so quiet that we had trouble
llndlng out the name of the groom
Miss Sybil McFarland ond Mr. "Steve"
Carter were married at the residence
of Willi Jones, Elder L. L. Shaw per
forming tho ceremony. We ore not
acquainted with .the groom, but he ap
pears to be a quiet, industrious young
man. The bride is a favorite with all
who know her; quiet, unassuming and
gentle in all her ways. They have
the best wishes of the Herald force
for their happiness and prosperity.
SCHOOL LAND SALE IN PROGRESS.
Secretary Geo. A. Smith, of the State

of the sale a large niimber of people
are in town and some brisk bids are
being made on the land. The land for
the most part Is bringing high prices,
some especially good quarters bring

Rev, W. M Hutchinson, pastor of
the Presbyterian Church for some time
past, but who resigned his pastorate
here last week, went to Ouymon this
week and is contemplating locating
