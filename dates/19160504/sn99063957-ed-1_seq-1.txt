He Thinks These Will Make
Demand for Increase and
Strikes Will Result
Washington, May 4. Figures aim
'.led by the bureau of labor statistics
today showed that the average wage in
crease in the industries where there
have been increases in the United
states in past year has oeen 11 per
cent. The following average increases
have been put into effect:
Nineteen per cent pnint manufactur
ing industries.
Seventeen per eent automobile and
auto part factories.
fifteen per cent flour and grist mill
workers, ship bunders, electrical supply
industries, iron and steel workers.
Fourteen per cent rubber goods, roa
c.inery, foundry, locomotives.
Thirteen per cent lime, dry goods,
hardware, paper and products.
Five per cent pottery, pressed brick,
groceries and woolens.
Kleven per eent chemicals, clothing.
Hoop, fertilizers.
Sine per cent agricultural imple
ments, furniture, shoes, leather,
luces.
Wight per cent Confectionary, com
mon cotton goods.
Seven per cent department store1,
lints, watches, advertising, office ma
chine, dental supplies and roofing ma
terials. Six per cent tobacco and cigars.
Five per cent coal and coal mining,
t.'ii-pets, rugs, linoleum nd glasses.
For, the most part these increases
Inve gone to skilled lnW, but then
have been numerous increases ii( wages
paid unskilled labor.
The figures given do not include in
creases thiit'hnve tniten the form or
boons, as in many munitions plants.
The .04,000,000 annual increase in
wages which began May 1 for 700.500
workers will stimulate 2,29.'!,5O0 others
to immediate demands. Secretary Mor
rison of the American Federation of La
bor predicted.
In addition to this vast number of
organized labor's members, Morrison
wi'd he expected numerous demonstra
tions from the far larger number of
unorganized workers.
"It is the history of "0 years that
May should see new demands by labor
ers," he said. "May marks the real
beginning of spring. Tne workingmnn
who has had an indifferent fall and
winter reviews the past 12 months labor
an l decides whether to continue under
the same conditions or to demand
changes.
"The past year has seen many con
cessions in hours and wages to working
men. But these charges were brought
about either through compulsion or were
yranted with the idea of tying the
hands of the workers in regard to other
dc 'minds. Many have been wrung from
employers after struggles just as dis
tasteful to workers ns to capital.
"In May the 'fruits of. the new year
are nil ahead. The business of the
world begins and the worl.-r knows
that unless he succeeds in adjusting his
needs on May 1 they will h turown
into tlx background by th Kssrre of
liu.i'i"fg until a day more con- ruient
to hi. employer."

Who Help p Army, Is
Found rdered
By E Jacobs
(L'nited Press f Correspondent)
Naniiquipn, A' g MayB. (My rauio)
1. V Holly of q 'aso, a rancher and
scout for tieneiu. ?rshing, was killed
Tuesday a'ternoon while scouting for
a detachment of the .Sixth cavalry near
Rubio. When Holly did not return, a
second detachment was sent to search
for him. The soldiers found his corpse.
He formerly lived at Bustillos, Mex
ico, where he had n large cattle ranch
and a farm. Kubio is 40 miles south
of army headquarters and 25 miles
uortheast of San Antonio. It is known
ns a resort of Villistas.
Soldiers and scouts were repeatedly
warned against appearing in that vicin
ity without taking great precautions.
Holly is believed to have been the vic
tim of a small band.
It wus from Kubio that Villistas un
der Fnblo I.opez sallied forth the night
of January VI when a train was held
up and 1!) Americans murdered.
Holly is believed to have returned to
Rubio to search for cattle which he was
forced to leave when he and other
Americans fled. He rendered highly
valuable service to the American forces
ami was correspondent for a news syn
dicate. Wounded Reach Columbus
Columbus, N. M., May 4. Twenty
seven disabled soldiers and one wound
ed Mexican boy arrived here today in
motor ambulances from the interior of
Mexico. They were transported from
the American base of operations at San
Antonio, Mexico, and taken to hosp
als hero and at F.l Paso.
No word has been lecelved from Gen
eral Pershing for three days. Officers
believed that he has transferred his
staff to San Antonio. In the past 24
hours 108 motor trucks load of ap
plies went into Mexico from Columbus.
Pershing has not yet been Informed of
the pact agreed to by Generals ,seo
and Obregon.
Prices Were Irregular
and Market Yery Dull
Xew York, May 4. The New York
Sun's financial review today said:
Little interest was manifested and
there was nothing of importance in the
early trading. Prices moved irregularly
within a narrow range with the ex
ception of industrials. Lansing's an
nouncement that he had received word
t0 the effect that Gerard would for
ward the German reply today brought
tho trading elsewhere almost to a
standstill.
Naturally the public, which had lit
tle or nothing to do with the market
since the internntinol crisis nssumed
its acute phase, continued its waiting
attitude. Dealings were wholly pro
fessional. Even traders showed a dis
position to hold off until they could ob
tain a definite understanding of the
character of the reply. Activity cen
tered in a handful of stocks.
Prices backed and filled throughout
the session, making little progress in
either direction until early afternoon,
when the list sagged. Reactionary
tendencies were more pronounced in the
late dealings.

Teddy Says He Is Not Seek

Xew York, May 4. "I am not seed

This is the concluding sentence of a
letter which Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
sent to an Ohio German-Americun who
wrote suggesting that thu colonel "tone
down" some statements he made with
regard to Belgium, so as to command
the vote of Germans and Irishmen. The
reply was given to the l'nited Press
and reads as follows: '

(l'nited Press staff corres

reply to the American subma
rine demands was handed to
Ambassador Gerard this after
noon. Foreign Minisirr Von Jngow
handed the German reply to
Gerard at 5:40 p. m. Gerard re
ceived the note at the foreign
office. He then went to the em
bassy where the work of coding
it was begun. Clerks expect
to work lute on the note before
it is cabled.
With the delivery of the note,
the foreign office announced
that the text would be nvide

By Robert J. Bender.
(l'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, M. 4. Though garbled
in transmission the note from Ambas
sador Gerard giving an advance view of
the German reply to the American sub
marine demands was taken officially to
show a reason fo rnptimism.
The time taken in framing the re
ply caused a belief among o'fficials here
that a temporizing message would be
most likely. Others think that the ef
fort to frame a reply directly comply
ing with the demands but not arous
ing too much feeling in Germany is the
explanation of the delay.
President Wilson and Secretary Lans
ing conferred last night. If the Ger
man reply failed to squarely meet the
administration's demands it will be
deemed satisfactory. It was stilted that
the president had not wavered in his
determination that Germany must ac
quiesce completely. German official
dom here said that if Germany agrees
on the question of" principal, it only
remains to determine the "method" of
warfare, which the governments can
agree on.
The first messages from Ambassador
Gerard in nearly n week reached the
state department today, reporting the
German press comment on the subma
rine situation. It included one newspa
per article which said that responsibil
itv for any break between America r'
Germany must rest Uj.on President Wil
son. The German rr.ly will probnblv not
be received at the state department be
fore Saturday, but the government ex
pects information as to its contents to
morrow. Gerard cabled that he was for
warding a report on his conference with
the kaiser. The report is expected to
contain a sort of advance summary of
the German attitude.

"Moreover, you say I ought to mod

Lubin's Parcel Post Idea Given
Trial at Sacramento
Proves Success
Sacramento, Cal., May 4 Direct mar
keting from the farm to the city con
sumers, based upon David Lubin's par
cel post idea, is being tried out, and
the very first duy the price of city re
tailers was cut.
New potatoes Wi'e marketed today at
four cents a pouting w"-'.U city dealers
were selling them at five and six cents.
Eggs, under the direct marketing plan,
sold for 2.'5 cents while retailers charged
their customers 23 cents a dozen. Cher
ries sold for 10 cents a pound ns against
the store price of 12 i-2 and 15 cents.
For the present, the parcel post is not
used. The Pomona grange, which he
charge of the experiment, sends an au
tomobile around to various places in the
country to collect the farm products
The grange has coupon books which are
sold to housewives in the city at $2.3r.
Tne housewife pays by coupon and each
farmer hns a number so that he is re
sponsible for goods delivered.
While the plan is, thus fur, being
carried out in a smnll way the pos
sibilities loom up big.
The experiment will be carried on
for a month ami the results will be re
ported to congress with the view of
hnving that body act favorably on the

PR1E
OF BEING HANGED
WITH SILKEN ROPE
Not Knowing How to Fight
Troops Were Slaughtered
By William O. Shepherd.
(United Prens staff correspondent.)
Berne, May 4. "My son und his
regiment knew how to die but they
didn't know how to 'fight."
The English father who said this of
his dead soldier son who had been train
ed only three months paints a picture
of the plight of the average American
if tho l'nited States wero plunged into
war aad needed millions of troops
quick.
It's all riirht to know how to die,
they sny here in Switzerland, but it's
better to know how to fight. By fight
ing you lessen your chance of dying.
A soldier hasn't got any right to die,
unless there's nothing else left for him
to do.
Fighting today is nn exact science.
Rend a book of military instructions. It
tells you every last thing a soldier
oiiL'ht to do. in cverr possible contin
gency. Muster militaristis have worked
it all out and put it down, Swiss citir.cn
soldiers know how to do 20 different
things in a pinch, before they resort
to dying. They know how to die, too,
if it comes to that.
How long does it take a Swiss youth
to learn how to fight instead of diet
How long would it take an American
youth to learn the same thing!
GALLANT LURE
Winner of Contest Killed In
Moment of Victory by.

Tncoma, Wash., May 4. Ono of two
childish rivals for the admiration of a
little girl of Lovelnnd lies dead today
as the outcome of a friendly tussle over
a bouquet of prairie flowers that the

George Ehlers, aged 9, with a joyful
cry of victory on his lips, ran out on
the hinhwnv at Loveland with the
coveted wild flowers and was struck
and instantly killed by .n automobile
stage.
George and his rival 'of tho same ago
had agreed that "she" should bo pre
sented with a bouquet. The two would
wrest lc for the honor of presentation.
The flowers were picked and thrown
to the ground and the friendly contest
began. Companions cheered their fav
orite. Then finally George jerked tho
flowers from, his rival and darted
across the highway. Cheers suddenly
changed to cries of grief as the chil
dren saw George hurled to death by
tho automobile. The little girl did not
witness the combat or its fatal ending.
