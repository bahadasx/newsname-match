ROUND UP OF IRISH
REBELS IS PRESSED
Body of The O'Reilly. One of
Dublin Sinn Fein Leaders,
Is Found.
RECENT DISTURBANCES
IN SOUTH AND WEST
Further Casualties Reported Among
Troops Operating Against
Insurrectionists.
TM'RUN. .May 4 ?The round-up of
rebels still at large is going on rapidly
and systematically. The Sinn Fein
i rusade was conducted so openly that
most of it* adherents are known to the
police. House-to-house search is being;
made for those not accounted for and
notices" signed -by Maj. (*en. Sir John
Max wet! are posted everywhere warning
any who harbor rebels that they
w ill be liable to arrest arid punishment.
How serious the food situation became
at the height of the revolution
here may be judged from the fact that
butter sold at SJ a pound, flour at $1 a
pound and potatoes at SO cents.
Since the beginning of the disturbance
the city virtually has been cut off
news from the outside world.
Nearly all supplies of print paper were
Used by the rebels for barricades. The
p.emises of the Freeman's Journal and
the Evening Telegraph were burned to
the ground, while the offices of the
. '..i'y Express and the Evening Mail
we -e badly damaged.
The O'Reilly, one of the rebel leadis
believed to ha\e been shot
v !e attempting to escape from the

been found in Moore lane, near the
bost office building.
There were some disturbances in
tii south and west of Ireland Tuesday.
In which some casualties occurred, the
? respondent adds, but the rest of
the country is quiet.
Move About the City.
The people of Dublin are now permitted
to move about the city freely
for the first time since the uprising,
and crowds come out to view the ruins
caused by the riots. Passes are still
required to go through the military
cordon in certain parts of the city,
however, and examination posts have
ben established on all roads leading
V-Din Dublin. At these points autoi.
cb;les and trains are searched for
aims. Persons who intend to take
H^ace on trains are scrutinized be*?o
they enter the stations. Only the
Dublin, Belfast. Kingstown and Green?
st. tions are open for the embarkation
of passengers.
It is stated that rebels whose cases
are of such a nature that they can be
d'sposeri of at once are being tried by
court-martial under the defense of the
jealm act. Others, who cannot be dealt
with immediately, are being "sent to
Kngiand.
?"onfldence is rapidly returning
among the civilian population, and although
work has not been generally
resumed manv stores have been reopened.

The south and west of Ireland are at
present the only places where disturbances
are rife and these are being
sharply suppressed. Some further

under the hottest Are. In several
parts of Ireland the Sinn Fein
organization did riot take part in the
outbreak, but, as they possess huge
quantities of arms and ammunition,
they are being closely watched. Orders
have been issued demanding that
they immediately surrender all their
arms and. in rase these bodies of illegal
semi-soldiery do not comply with
the order, very effective steps are to
be taken against them by the military
authorities, who are aware that
for two years past Ireland has been
turned into a gigantic arsenal by persons
who had no right to possess arms.
Postal Service Be-Established.
A provisional postal service has
been established in Dublin, where letters
are now- arriving from the provinces
and from England, but no outgoing
mail service yet has been organized
and it is impossible to obtain
postage stamps
Tne authorities have acquired premises

Former U. S. Minister to Santo

the British.
i LEFT TO VISIT MOTHER

IN LIMERICK LAST JULY
; Had Been Virtually Asked to Resign
Post in American Diplomatic
Service.
I
LONDON. May 4. 3:12 p.m.?
! James M. Sullivan of New York,
i formerly American minister to
' Santo Domingo, has been arrested
1 in Dublin on the charge of complicity
in the Irish rebellion.
Sailed for Ireland Last July.
Mr. Sullivan sailed from New York
last July for Liverpool, with his wife
and son, saying; he was going to Limerick,
Ireland, to visit his mother. He
said he expected to he hack in New
York by September 1.
Shortly before he sailed Mr. Sullivan
was virtually asked to resign his post
as minister to the Dominican Republic,
as the result of an investigation conducted
by a commission headed by
Senator Phelan of California.
It was understood the report censured
Mr. Sullivan for indiscretions in
the conduct of his office, though praising
him for certain reforms he put into
effect. Testimony taken by the commission
during its investigation in
Santo Domingo was to the effect that
| the minister was interested in con
tracts in which other Americans were
j concerned. July L'y it was announced
j that Mr. Sullivan had resigned.
Appointment Credited to Bryan.
Sullivan harl 1 oon o In r.- r.. ? i -
Rose, one of the gamblers in the
Rosenthal murder case. His appointment
as United States minister generally
was credited to former Secretary
Bryan, who, in looking for a place for
him, wrote Receiver General Vick in
the Dominican republic asking. "What
positions have you at your disposal
with which to reward deserving democrats?"
Secretary Tumulty disclaimed responsibility
for Sullivan's appointment,
and told the investigating committee
he acted simply as the medium of
transmitting Sullivan's indorsements. !
Sullivan was exonerated once by Secretary
Bryan, but the charges against
} him would not down, and a second in- I
j v<?siigafion resulted in his resignation.!
When he left office SulHvan said he j
was going to Ireland for a vacation,
and the capital, which had been inter- |
ested in his case for months, forgot J
I him.
I The news of his arrest for alleged
complicity in the Dublin uprising was
the first news of him since he left
| the diplomatic service. Former Gov.
j Fort of New Jersey, who conducted
I the first investigation, declared Sulj
livan was "a big-hearted, good-natured,
honest Irishman."
I Some of Sullivan's characteristics ex
! cited a good deal of attention In the
Capitol while he was here waiting for
| his appointment.
j .Sullivan was born at Killarney, Ire!
land. January ' ?. 1872. and was brought
to the United States when a child.- He
i received his early education in the
I grammar schools and later entereo
J Vale. He received th" degree of Ld,.B.
I from that institution in 1902. He pracI
tired law in Connecticut from 1902 to
i 1906. when he went to New York, eni
gaging in practice there until 1912. Au|
gust 12 of the latter year he was ap|
oointed envoy extraordinary and min'
ister plenipotentiary to th* Dominican
I Republic. I
HOLDS W? YARD
I Judge Mullowny Moves Tribunal Because
Paralytic Prisoner Cannot
Get Into the Building.
A portion of the session of the United
States branch of the Police Court today
waa held in the courthouse yard.
The reason for holding the unusual
session was because Harry Carter, colored.
who was to be tried on sixteen
charges of larceny after trust, was unable
to go up to the courtroom, so the
court went to him. j
Carter was arrested in January and i
shortly after was stricken with paralysis.
For the past four months he has
been confined at Washington Asylum]
Hospital. He is unable to walk or to
even sit in a chair without being supported.
In the custody of Deputy Marshal
John O'Neill the defendant was
brought to court today. He was taken
there while lying on his back in the
bottom of the van and at the court he
was propped up in a chair in the yard.
Judge Alexander K. Mullowny, As-i,
sistant United States Attorney Ralph
'liven, <'hief <"lerk Francis Sebring and
Marshal O'Neill held the court in the
vard. <'arter pleaded guilty and after
being given an absolute sentence of
one year and a fine of $200, with four
months additional in default of the i
fine, he was placed on probation.

i PRESIDENT WILSON
MUSTCAST THE DIE
German Note Believed to Put
Final Word Up to
United States.
AMERICAN EMBASSY
MAY GET REPLY TODAY
Mr. Gerard Continues Absolutely
Uncommunicative in Regard to
the Situation.
BERLIN. May 4.?The German reply
to the American note on submarine
warfare may be expected momentarily.
It was expected that the note would
be handed to the American embassy
today.
Following: the submission of the
German reply, the center of gravity in
the situation, it is considered here,
will rest in Washington, where it must
be decided whether the proposal
which Germany makes meets the. conditions
of the last paragraph of the
American note.
The conference of high German authorities
at headquarters has been concluded.
and Dr. von Bet hmann-Hol 1weg.
the imperial chancellor, it is understood.
has started for Berlin.
Ambassador Gerard visited Foreign
Minister vpn Jagow here yesterday,
but continued absolutely uncommunicative
on the situation. The foreign
oifice also declined to have anything
to say on the subject.
Up to President Wilson.
The German reply to the American
note will not decide whether a breach
will come between the United States
and Germany, according to the Koelnische
Volks Zeitung. The decision,
this newspaper says, will rest entirely
with President Wilson, depending upon
'he answer ho is expected to make to
the German note.
The Volks Zeitung asserts that th#?
question now is whether President
Wilson will accept Germany's proposals
as satisfactory, or whether he desires"
"war at any price."
Officials Not Apprised
as to Contents of Reply;
President Is Determined
Secretary Lansing announced today
that a dispatch from Ambassador Gerard,
dated yesterday, said the ambassador
expected to receive today the German
reply to the American note demanding;
immediate abandonment of
present practices of submarine warfare.
Secretary Lansing said lie was
without any information whatsoever
of the conference Ambassador Gerard
had with Emperor William at grand
headquarters. The dispatch. SecretaryLansing
said, was very brief and contained
no indication of the tenor of the
German reply. News dispatches from
Berlin have indicated the German government
hoped it would be received
favorably.
Stone Calls on Secretary.
Chairman Stone of the Senate foreign
| relations committee tailed on Secrei
tarv Lansing an'ty briefly discussed the |
German and Mexican situations.
"Judging from the newspapers, the ;
I tensity or the situation with Germany j
| is very much less than it was,"' said |
Senator Stone. "It also appears mat
they have reached some agreement on
the border."
Senator Stone said there was no occasion
for congressional action as the
situation now stands.
White House Conference.
President Wilson. Secretary Lansing
arid Col. E. M. House held a long conference
last night at the, White House.
It is understood that the submarine
situation was discussed, but Secretary
Lansing said later that he had received j
absolutely no word from Berlin re- j
garding the character of the Herman
note, which press dispatches said
probably will be handed to Ambassador
Gerard today.
The President and his advisers are
keeping their minds open while they
wait for the German note. The long
delay very evidently has created a had
impression, however, and it was authoritatively
stated today that the
issue would have to be cleared up this
week if'diplomatic relations with Germany
were to continue.
President Determined.
The President is known to be unalterably
determined to adhere strictly
to the position assumed by the United
States in its demand that Germany immediately
declare and effect an abandonment
of its present methods of submarine
warfare.
No proposal of any kind will be accepted
by the American government, it
is said, unless it includes a declaration
of intention to stop sinking peaceful
ships at once. In this connection press
dispatches to the efTect that new orders
to submarine commanders would be
told of in the German note were read
with interest by officials, but comment
! was witnneia pending tne disclosure of
the nature oI the Instructions.

RIO JANKIKO, May 4.?The .Jornal do
Cominercio, in an editorial, protests
vehemently against the sinking of the
Brazilian steamship Rio Branco, announcement
of which was made Tuesday.
't considers it impossible that
"America will continue to witness with
folded arms the continuation of these
tragedies." The paper suggests co-operation
with the United States, saying:
It Is our imprescriptible duty to react

Spain Supports U. S. View.
PARIS. May 4.?The Spanish govern- j
ment. says a dispatch to the Temps
from Madrid, is disposed to support the j
policy of the United States regarding }
submarine warfare, and if America asks J
neutral powers in general to safeguard j
their rights Spain Is willing to sub- j
scribe to a general understanding with i
a view of preventing Germany from J
continuing the form of submarine war- .
fare she heretofore has followed. I
RESULT OF GERMAN BREAK.
Would Be Entire Shift of World
Diplomatic Intercourse.
One of the most troublesome complications
that would result on the breaking
off of our diplomatic relations j
with Germany would be the readjust- j
ment all over the world, caused by I
the taking over by the diplomatic rep- j
resentatives of some other neutral (
country 'of the duties officials of the j
United States have been carrying on i
their shoulders from the time the warbroke
out in August, 1914. To these
duties the various nations have been
adding one by one as they entered I
th*? war. The representatives of the i
State Department in Great Britain, j
nuHHia, r ramx, neruia, .iii|>an aim
Portugal have been acting: in the interest
of Germany ever since each of
those countries declared war against
that nation. SimilaTly, Ambassador
Gerard has been caring for the interests
of those countries in Berlin. Ambassador
Penfield. at Vienna, is doing
a similar service. Probably the ambassador
or minister of one of the
South American republics would take
over those tasks. That nations may
have ended diplomatic intercourse \
with one another and still remain at ]
peace is shown through such coinpara- j
lively recent instances as the long !
break between Great Britain and i
Venezuela over their boundary dispute:
the fact that Peru and Chile
have no diplomatic representatives at
the present time; Germany and Italyare
getting along with what is styled
"suspended diplomatic intercourse,"
and the break between Austro-Hungary
and the Mexican republic, following
the assassination of Emperor Maximilian,
did not result in anything more
serious.
REQUISITION 'TWO CHINAMEN.'
U. S. Officers at Namiquipa Are Furnished
Them "Fully Equipped."
COEOXIA DUBLA.Y. Chihuahua. May
4. ? Perhaps one of the queerest demands
made upon the quartermaster's
department of the American expeditionary
command lias been received
here from field headquarters at Namiquipa.
This requisition asked for "two
Chinamen, fully equipped."
Behind the requisition is a story of
the rivalry between the various Ameri- :
can camps along the line of communication.
Officers at Dublan obtained the
services of two Chinese cooks, whose <
fame spread through Gen. Pershing's
force. Officers at Namiquipa learned of ;
the skill of the cooks and determined
that the only way to obtain similar J
service was to make a demand upon
the quartermaster, who has been asked 1
to ^supply the command with every- ?
thing from locomotives to needles. The
next truck train carried two Chinese '
chefs, properly accounted for in the I
cargo manifest. i
Famine in Epirus Reported.
BERLIN, May 4.?"Dispatches from

Suffer Heavy Losses.
BERLIN, May 4.-*-A German correspondent
on the Verdun front is quoted
by the Overseas News Agency today as
declaring that the French during the
last few days have been making violent
local attacks 011 the German lines
before the fortress and suffering heavy
losses in their attempts to recapture
observation posts that the Germans
had taken.
Tne Germans. the correspondent I
points out, control a large area behind
their lines available for the disposition
of reserves and the bringing up of supplies.
while the French are forced to
concentrate in uen.se masses in tne sectors
of a fan, the rim of which are
formed by the lines which the Germans
are attacking.
Thus every road and every camping
place, in fact, every foot of land is under
the German Are, while the French
artillery is forced to cover a large area
seeking out spots where it is supposed
the German troops are located. On the
other hand, the correspondent declares,
each German shot finds its mark
and the German heavy artillery causes
havoc.
Admits French Success.
It is officially announced that the
French have obtained a foothold in one
of the German advance posts south of
Dead Man hill. Today's army headquarters
statement follows: <
"In the sector between Armentieres j
and Arras there has been some lively !
fighting. Near Souchez and northeast
of Lens there have been some mine en- gagements
and similar fighting near '
Neuville. Northwest of Lens an at- '
tempt by the English to advance following
some mine explosions failed.
In the sector of the Meuse the artillery
fire on both sides increased, with great
violence during the evening and was
exceptionally violent in the night. A
French attack against our positions on
the slopes to the west of Dead Man (
hill were repulsed. To the southwest
of the hill the enemy obtained a foot- 1
hold in one of our advanced posts. s

of Villa bandits under Cardenas. This
is the information contained in a dispatch
from Gen. Pershing to Gen. Funston
here today. A detachment of the r
6th Infantry, under Lieut. Wetherell
and guided by Holly, went out the 8
morning of the 29th to run down the p

accepted the terms agreed upon by his
minister of war. The formal ratification
will follow rapidly, it is expected,
as soon as the word from Washington
comes that the agreement is satisfactory.
Says Tension Will Disappear.
Gen. Obregon told his associates today
that he saw no reason why the settlement
should not be quickly effected,
and he believed that the tension between
the Mexicans and Amertcana
would quickly disappear when the news
was spread that an understanding had
been reached that had for its object the
retirement of the American soldiers
from Mexican soil.
Gen. Obregon seemed gratified over
reports that large mining companies
were planning to operate their Mexican
properties, thus giving work to
thousands of persons.
Gens. Scott and Funston. the American
conferees, waited today for word
from Washington that they might request
a formal conference with Gen.
Obregon and his associates. There wae
nothing to suggest a possibility that
the agreement might not be found acceptable
in all its phases to the administration.
The two American generals were
pleased with press dispatches from
Washington saying ihat the administration
found the letniK <>f the tiro
posed settlement satisfactory. "The
American conferees said that the official
news might contain suggestions
for some modification of the proposed
terms. They could not say whether a
conference would be held today.
Regarded as Mexican Victory.
Gen. Obregon and his advisers were
in good humor today, and everywhere
on the Mexican side of the river it
was apparent that the negotiations to
date were regarded as a diplomatic
victory for the Mexican conferees.
It was pointed out that the great
fear of the Carranza government had
been intervention by the United States,
and that the chief reason withdrawal
of troops had been asked was because
it was feared a clash between them and
the natives would bring on intervention.
With the expeditionary force confined
to a limited area, and the greater
part of the bandit pursuit left to them,
the Mexicans feel that the danger of
such clashes has been minimized. They
feel tnat they will soon be able to
eliminate the bandit groups, thereby
earning the withdrawal of Gen. Tershing'e
columns.
The Mexicans set another cause for
satisfaction in the prospective signing
of a protocol. They regard the latest
developments as further evidence of
the intention of the United States to
stand back of the de facto government,
and believe they will have a marked
effect in discouraging revolutionary

The early resumption of ammunition
shipments south of the border will be of
great assistance to the <"arranza forces,
it is pointed out by army men here,
as it will aid them greatly in prosecuting
their latent campaign against

beginning with the capture of Cuernavaca.
