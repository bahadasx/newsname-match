fore President Wilson today by
Secretary Baker, was character
ized by officials as "satisfactory."
It is understood to proTide for the
nse of Mexican railways and sets
no definite time for the withdraw
al of General Pershing's force.
The American government is
ready to accept in its main points
the agreement for the future pnr
snit of Villa and his bandits,
drawn np by General Obregon,
the Carranza minister of war, and
General Scott, representing the
I nited States. This was decided
at a conference today between
President Wilson and Secretary
Baker.
Formal annooneement of the
position of the American govern
ment will not be given out until
General Carranza has had oppor
tunity to pass on the report sub
mitted to him by General Obre
gon. Officials here take it for
granted that General Obregon
would not hate made an agree
ment which would not hare been
accepted by his chief.
Secretary Baker sent a message
to General Scott on the future
conduct of the negotiations.
Terms of the tentative agreement are
understood to provide that American
troops shall not go farther sooth than
they now are and will be withdrawn as
soon as the Carranza government con
vinces the United States of its capacity
to protect the American border ter
ritory. They also provide, for coop
eration with Carranza troops for
cleaning up the bandits. Some unim
portant changes in the agreement as
made between General Scott and Gen
eral Obregon may be made here.

""E1 Paso, Texas, May 4. Ratification
of the tentative agreement between
Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief of
staff of the United States army and
General Alvaro Obregon, minister of
war of the de facto government of
Mexico, awaits only the acceptance by
President Wilson of the terms of the
proposed settlement. Advices received
in Juarez today indicated that First
Chief Carranza had given his consent
to the terms agreed upon by his min
ister of war.
General Obregon said he believed
tension between the Mexicans and
American would quickly disappear
when the news was spread that an
understanding had been reached that
had for its object the retirement of
the American soldiers from Mexican
soil. General Obregon seemed grat
ified today over reports that the large
mining companies were planning to
operate their properties.
Pleased With Dispatches.
Generals Scott and Funston waited
for word from Washington that they
might request a formal conference
with General Obregon.
Major Generals Scott and Fnnston
were pleased with the press dispatch
es from Washington that the adminis
tration found the terms of the pro
posed settlement satisfactory. They
could not say whether a conference
would be held today.

THE WAR TODAY
The French are continuing their
counter offensive movement near
Dead Man's Hill in the Verdun re
gion, following their capture of
German positions northwest of
the height. They continued their
advance, besides consolidating the
positions already taken, accord
ing to this afternoon's official bulletin-There
has been grenade fighting
in the Avtwurt wood southwest
of Dead Man's Hill, and heavy
artillery bombardments else
where In toe district west of the
Mense and in the Vans region,
northwest of the fortress.
It has been established that
three, and not four, leaders of the
Irish rebellion have been execut
ed. The men condemned and sbot
were Patrick H. Pearse, the pres
ident of the provisional govern
ment; Thomas MacDonagh and
Thomas i. Clark. James Connol
ly, at first reported as also hav
ing been executed, is in prison,
wounded. The confusion arose,
according to London advices,
from the somewhat ambiguous an
nouncement . of the executions
made by Premier Asquith in the
house of commons.
Additional Russian troops have
been landed in France for service
on the western front.
No fighting of great importance
has been reported from any of the
battle fronts.
Northeast of Terdnn, near Le
Mort Homme, the French took sev
eral German positions in a well
executed attack and captured on
hundred prisoners and a number
of machine guns. On the remainder
of the fronts in France and Bel
gium, only artillery duels arc re
ported. The Austrfans and Italians are
still engaged in shelling in the
Adamello region but no important
changes have (aken place.
Thirty-six casualties resnlted
from the Zeppelin raid on the east
coast of Fngland Tnesday night.
The Zeppelin L-20, which was
wTecked in falling at Hafso Firth,
Norwav, belonged fo a squadron of
five airships which attacked the
east coast of Enirland Tuesday.
The crew were rescued and in.
ferned in Norway.

Lone Plea f
Givenforlrish
Rebels Killed
London, May 4 The only protest
voiced in parliament yesterday against
the execution of the three leaders of
the Irish revolution came from Lau
rence Ginnc, member of the north di
vision of Westmeth, who is classed as
a nationalist, but is actually an inde
pendent The three leaders, Patrick
H. Pearse, Thomas J. Clark and
Thomas MacDonagh, were shot Wed
nesday morning after trial by court
martial. John Redmond, Irish parliamentary
leader, joined with Sir Edward H.
Carson, leader of the Irish Unionists,
in a plea for leniency toward the great
mass of the revolutionists.
In the remarkable speech explain
ing his resignation as chief secretary
for Ireland, Augustine Birrell con
fessed that he had miscalculated the
strength and seriousness of the Sinn
Fein movement. Mr. Birrell paid a
tribute to the Irish race and said that
he hoped good might come from the
grave events at Dublin. "Irish sol
diers," he said, "are still the best rep
resentatives of their country, fighting
as they are in all theatres of the war."
Mr. Birrell admitted that he had
been urged by a great many persons
who knew Ireland better than he did
that it was the duty of the govern
ment to suppress the Sinn Fein move
ment wherever they found it and take
away their arms, although up to the
I last moment no proof had been forth-
comingMhat they were in hostile as
sociation with the enemy. He asked
the house, however, to consider what
the circumstances might have been
had such a step been taken.

Illinois cities was begun today by
United States District Attorney
Charles F. Clyne, following the re
quest made yesterday by Judge Kene
saw Landis that the operations of the

can be found that they are breaking
the postal laws.
According to the district attorney,
there are not less than 25 "loan
sharks" in Joliet, nine in Rockford,

BEWAILS PLIGHT OF
MERCHANT MARINE
London, May 3, 10:50 p. m. Admiral
Baron Charles Beresford called the
attention of the house of lords today
to the depletion in the tonnage of
British ships needed for trade pur
poses, asserting that unless it were
remedied it would endanger the sup
ply of food, and asking the govern
ment to consult labor leaders with a
view to obtaining more labor for ship
building. In reply, Earl Curzon said the gov
ernment is now administering the
whole British mercantile marine,
amounting to half the gross tonnage
of the world. Forty-three per cent of
the British tonnage, he added, has
been requistioned for naval and mil
itary purposes, 14 per cent is occu
pied in carrying foodstuffs and raw
material in behalf of the government
and its allies, and the remaining 43
per cent is being operated by British
ship owners under state regulations.
By using British supplies of timber
for sleepers, pit props and other pur
poses, Earl Curzon believed England
would be less dependent upon foreign
supplies and quite a large result from
the experiment, was expected in a few
