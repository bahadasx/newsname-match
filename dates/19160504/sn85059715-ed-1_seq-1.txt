ARCHIE FISHER. IS
PAINFULLY INJURED
Boy Struck by Street Car Has'
Left Leg Broken and is
Badly Scratched.
Another fatal street car accident!
was narrowly averted Thursday
morning when Archie Fisher, aged 13 !
years, of Broad Oaks, was hit by a I
Broad Oaks car of the Monongahela |
Valley Traction Company in Monti
cello avenue just south of the old gas
house. The boy suffered a broken
leg and several scratches about his
face and hands. He is a patient at
the eKssler hospital and while his;
Injuries are painful he will recover.!
According to persons who wit
nessed the accident, young Fisher
was standing on the west side of the
street by a telephone pole throwing
stones at several ducks that were
swimming in the creek. Apparently
lie did not hear the approaching car.
The motorman seeing him sounded
the gong several times to warn Fish
er that the car was approaching. See
ing that the boy did not lieed the
warning the motorman slowed down
the car and just as he reached thei
spot, where Fisher was standing Fish
er turned and tried to cross the track.
The car struck him and knocked him
off the track against the telephone
pole inflicting the injuries noted.
Hal not the motorman seen
him standing behind the telephone
pole and slowed the car down the boy
In all probability would have been
killed iDBtantly.
Young Fisher is a son of Jacob F.
Fisher, of Broad Oaks, un employe
of the Hope Natural Gas Company, ]
and had been employed as a news- j
boy by the different newspapers of the
city. It could not be learned what
the boy was doing in o.Mnticello ave
nue at the time the accident occurred.

West Virginia Republicans In largo

their alternates to the 'Republican
national convention to bo held In

Chairman Sherrard railed the con
ventlon to order and named 12. W.
Wells, of Newell, as temporary chair
man.
Mr. Well* addressed the conven
tion hh foil own:
"Thin opportunity that has been
graciously given me by fhe state com
mittee to preside for a while over a
state convention of West Virginia
Republicans; the opportunity to
make some brief mention of the mo
mentous Ibsu?s for which Republi
cans will tight in the coming nation
al campaign I accept with a keen ap
preciation of the responsibilities Im
posed, and of the honor conferred.
"West Virginia conventions of our
splendid party are always notable for
intense eurnestness and enthusiasm.
They are marked by a fine exhibition
of party spirit, that working In har
mony swoops everything before It.
"It requires only a glance over this
body ol men, or Just a little mingling
with them In the lobbies of the ho
tels, to demonstrate that this con
vention is to be no exception to tho
West Virginia rule.
j "In striking contrast to tho pres
ent harmony on national Issues, our
party, four years ago, at the Hunt
ington convention, was divided by Its
; allegiance to opposing party leaders. '
On account of that division, our state
I was lost on national Issues, and that
same division, nation-wide, lost us
tho country. Rut happily, that old
wound Is healed, and waiving all
questions of who was right and who
was wrong, we are bore today with a
single purpose to start an Irresistiblo
movement to recover all that was
lost and more.
"Tho hatchet is burled, let UH
hope, beyond tho peradventure of
resurrection nnd this convention
should celebrate our first gfaud re
union. That all breafrs in the ranks
may have taught some lessons that
are good for the political souls of all
of us. This may be our 'Pentecost of
Calamity.'

PLANS ARE ADOPTED
FOR. NEW HOSPITAL
Work is to Be Started upon
Commodious Structure in
the near Future.
Announcement If! made by the Mas
on Hospital Company, composed of
Dr. S. M. Mason, l>r. C. X. Slater and
W. iH. Taylor, that the plans have been
dcclded upon for the new hospital
building It is to erect on Mechanic
street JUBt west of the Kessler hospital
and that work is to be started in the
near future.
The new hospital will have room
and facilities for caring for about forty
to fifty patients, which Is double that
of the Kessler. The building Is to be
n five story brick and tilo Are proof
structure costing approximately from
$50,000 to $60,000, when fully com
pleted. The Mason Hospital Com
pany Is Incorporated at $7G,000.
It la hoped that work can be start
ed on the building by the first of next
month, depending of course on how
soon the bids can be taken and the
contract let. It is planned to havo the
new hospital In operation by January
1,1917. When the new building Is
completed the Kessler hospital build
ing will likely be converted Into an
apartment house.
?west Ideas.
Dr. S. M. Mason, who has success
fully managed the Kessler. *111 have
charge of the new hospital. Dr. Ma
son before considering plans for the
building went to New York. Balti
more. Washington, Pittsburg, and
Wheeling, where he made a visit to
the leading hospitals, getting the lat
est ideas for nse in the erection of the
institution here. Edward F. Stephens,
of Boston, an architect who makes a
specialty of drawing plans for hos
pltals, wan employed.
The now hospital has *0 many new
rnd advantageous features that It is
difficult to enumerate them all. A
big feature and 11 remarkable Im
provement over the old system is the
almost complete elimination ot noise
In the building. A noiseless call sys
tem for the nurses will be Installed.
An electric automatic elevator, which
will run from the basement to the top
floor, will do away with much of the
noise made climbing stairs. The
elevator runs smoothly and almost
noiselessly.
Plenty of Sunlight.
Each floor will have a large ver
anda, bo arranged \nat patients may
bo taken out in their beds and wheel
chairs Into the fresh air and sunshine.
Each veranda will be so arranged that
it will be converted Into a sun par
lor, with sky lights and sides arranged
like window panes. A sun parlor Is
not always best for the patient, for it
does not allow full advantage of plenty
of frtsh air. For this reason most ot
the verandas will be open?like out
doors, protected from falling weather
by a roof.
The operating suite will be on the
ground floor. Most operating rooms
are on the top floor, but the plans of
this building make It more convenient
to have it on the first floor. The suite
will be so arranged that none of the
fumes from the operating rooms can
get Into the rooms occupied by the
patients. Sterilizing and physicians'
and surgeons' scrub rooms will be sep
arate from the operating rooms.
Because they are the most sanitary
and can easily be steamed out and
sterilized, tin pipes will be used in
conveying water to the operating
