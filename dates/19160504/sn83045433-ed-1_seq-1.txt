El Paso. Tex.. May .-The reported
agreement between Maj. Gen. Hugh L.
Scott and Mexican Minister of War Ob

to suggestions from both sides as to how
an amicable understanding could he

The suggestions must be approved b
President Wilson and the constitutional

at a formal onferene.

be himself.

SCOTT'S FULL REPORT
RECEIVED BY LANSING
A fall and detailed report frem
Maj. Gen. Scott et him eoafereaeee
with Gen. Obrege., Carramaas
minister of war, concerning the
military situatio in Mexico was
received at the War Department
late last might.
Owing to the fact that Presi
dent Wilson would be unable to
consider It before today, Secretary
Baker declined to make it public.
He called up the White Hose
about 11 o'clock while the report
was still being decoded, but learned
that the President had retired.
"All that I can any now," he
declared. "Ws that the report is
a complete sammary of what tran
spired at the conferences and con
tains in tentative ferm the sag
geatlos put forth for as agree
ment between the two govern
ments. It is of such a character
that I do not feel at liberty to
make it pahlte until the President
has had opportanIty to consider
it."
The report is about 2,000 words
long. Secretary. Baker assumed
that there will be at least one
more conference.

CONFIDENT BERLIN REPLY
WILL PLACATE PRESIDENT
Wilson's Attitude One of "Revived
Hope. but No Undue Optimism."
Answer Eagerly Awaited.
Count von BernstorfT, the German Am
bassador, was very hopeful last night
over the submarine situation. Ile be
lieves that Germany's answer will fully
satiety the United States. Futhermore.
he is understood to have received pri
vate advices indieating that orders have
already been issued to German suhma
rin commanders not to continue their
methods of warfare against merchantmen
in the war zone.
Secretary Lansing said yesterday that
he had no knowiedge of this. His at
titude on the whole question, like the at
titude of President Wilson. is one of
"watchful waiting' for the German re
ply.
"Revived hope, hut ro undue optimism."
This characterizcs President Wilson's
frame of mind on the submarine issue.
t'rss dispatches have been received from
R-rin to the effect that Germany will
issue new instructions to submarine
commanders and will otherwise define
its attitude on future submarine warfare
against merchantmen. The tenor of these
censored dispatches is regarded here as
hopeful and the intimation is that Ber
lin will satisfy the American demands.
Officiale here foresee a possibility that
the crisis may he happily eliminated, or
at least postponed by Germany's agree
ng to abardon temporarily the present
methods of submarine warfare which
endanger the lives of noncombatants on
the high seas. If this vital point in the
American demands is met the danger
of a diplomatic break will be dissipated.
it is explained. and interest therefore
centere now on whether Rerlin will un
equivocally agree on this vital issue.

of the third day of camp life for the
500 young women out at Chevy Chase
who are preparing themselves for
"first aid" work in time of warfare.
Speaking on the topic of "National
Preparedness." Mr. Breckinridge made
an earnest plea for compulsory univer

that not only was universal service
the only military system based in fair
ness, equality or justice, but that un
der the law of supply and demand,
which obtains in political as well as
commercial life, the other nations of
the world had been brought to it, and
that America would sooner or later
have to follow suit.
"Universal service does not mean
militarism; there is no connection be

HIS BOOM EXPECTED TO

ity the sun News service.)
ftvOter Ily. N. Y . May i.-Three dele
gates to the Chicago convention, two
Repuhllans and one Progressive, told
Col. Roosevelt today that under no cir
cumstances would they support Elihu
Root as a Presidential candidate. And
there are others. some of them Repub
lican leaders high in the counsels of the
party, who refusa to hack Senator Root's
candidacy for the nomination, it is
statAl.
All of the delegates who have made
pilgrimages to Sagamore Hill-and many
of them have been Republicans-have
been in accord on this. Moreover, Sena
tor Root's strength is believed to be
greatly overrated, and It is reported that
the growing proportions of his boom,
whether or not it is designed to head off
the Roosevelt boom, is also intended to
bring out Justice Hughes.
Those who hold this view say that if
the convention's approach with the Root
boom still in full swing and with the Pro
gressive Republicans behind Roosevelt, it
will be evident that there can be no re
union with Root, and that then Justice
Hughes will find the nomination thrust
upon him as a candidate in the interests
of party harmony, and one whom both
wings of the party can support.
The three delegates who called on Col.
Roosevelt today asked him what his at
titude was towards Senator Root or any
other candidate. They got no satisfac,
tion.

Mrs. Hardie testified that on September

GUARD CITY'S
WATER SUPPLY
Officials Protect Conduit Fol
lowing Threat to Blow Up
Cabin John Bridge.
HOLES FOUND IN BASES
SOON AFTER WARNING
Guards have been placed about the
('ahin John Bridge to protect the city's
water supply from being cut off through
the blowing up of the conduit pipes which
support the bridge, it was admitted at
the War Department last night. Threat
ening letters were said to have been
received about two weeks ago, which
declaged the bridge would be dynamited.
No further disclosure of the nature of
the letters could be obtained.
Armed guards have been hired to watch
the bridge ever since the threats were
received. Reports in the neighborhood
state that holes were found at the four
bases of the structure shortly after the
receipt of the threatening communica
tions, in which it Is supposed the dyna
mite was to have been planted.
The city's water comes fourteen miles
down the Conduit road from Great
Falls and is distributed in the four
reservoirs. The point where it crosses
over Cabin John Bridge is the most
vulnerable part of the system, and the
destruction of the bridge would ef
fectively cut off the supply, leaving
the seat of government without drink
Ing water.
Officials of the water department re
called the fact that the War Depart
mient took the same precautions during
the Spanish-American war, at which
time the road was constantiy patroled
by soldiers.
At Dela Carlia, the reservoir nearest
the threatened point, offIcials ,refused
to give out information on the watch
being kept. but strongly suggested
that the step was only precautionary
to prevent cranks from damaging the
water system.

BODY OF CHILD,
LONG MISSING,
IS DISCOVERED
Eight-Year-Old Philadelphia
Boy Murdered in
Marsh.
ABDUCTED IN NOVEMBER
Anonymous Letter Described
Place Where Body Was
Found Under Bfush.
(D7 the flu News Serviee.)
Philadelphia, May .-The body of 9
year-old Richard Meekins,, cruelly mis
treated and murdered by a man who ab
ducted him November 29 last, was found
today. A man's handkerchief, knotted
about the child's neck, showed he had
been strangled.
Little Richards body lay, covered by
brush, on a pic. of high land in a marsh,
at a point that is approximately Sixty
ninth street anr Botanic road.
The spot is identical with that marked
on a rude map traced on the back of an
anonymous letter received by the child
victim's parents, January 29. The writer
of the letter said he had kidnapped Rich
ard and intimated he had killed him De
cember 5.
Clew Not Followed.
Detectives had dismissed the letter aj
the work of a crank, and no effort ap
parently was made to determine whetl.er
the anonymous writer's drawing, with a
figure to indicate the burial place of the
boy, bore any relation to the mysterious
disappearance of the Meekins child.
It was generally believed tonight that
the letter writer is the murderer, and
that his letter tells the true story of the
lad's disappearance.
It is hardly within the range of pos
slbilities, detectives admit, that any one
could draw such an accurate map of the
marshland and plainly mark tfle place of
the lad's burial without absolute knowl
edge of the topography of the section and
the burial of the boy.
A farmer, seeking strawberry plants,
crossed by accident the spot marked on
the anonymous writer's map- erd discov
ered the body. Strewn around it wer
the child's overcoat, cap and other arti
cles of clothing.
Father ldenttes Body,
An hour later, the police were hurrying
to the spot. Parents of the lad, who
live at 2449 Soeth FSxty-first street, were
notified. and the father met the patrol
wagon as it carrd th.' body, little more
than a skeleton, to the morgue. A glance
at the clothing c'onfirmed his fears
"It's my poor little boy,' he sobbed.
Mrs. Meekins., who has hoped and
prayed for the safe return of her boy,
is in a state of nervous collapse. She
had confidently hoped the child would
be restored to her, and at Christmas she
trimmed a tree for him .nd bought some
little gifts. Easter found a bunny in a
basket awn'ting Richard' return.
