receive and either approve or reject
th? agreement
The president conferred with Secre
tary Baker at noon on the code dis
patch received from General Scott, de
tailing the terms on which Scott and
Obregon had reached an understand
ing. Aside from the knowledge that
the agreement puts no time limit on
the stay of American troops in Mex
ico but does provide for the satis
factory use of Mexican railways, noth

regarding the contents of the agree
ment until Carranza has been heard

:'m awaiting a definite answer from
him," asid Obregon. "I will issue a
formal statement as soon as the agree

Obregon's officers said their chief
would leave for Mexico City as soon
as notified of Carranza's acceptance of
the conditions. He has installed a

Carranza in order to obtain immediate
word of the de facto leader's decision.

SHORT ON SHIPS?
English Admiral and Lord Dis
agree on Marine Seeds.
Sow Handling Half Gross Ton
nage of the World.
London, May 3. Admiral Baron
Charles Beresford called the attention
of the house of lords to thcdepletion
in the tonnage of British hips needed
for trade purposes, asserting unless it
was remedied it would endanger the
supply of food and asked the govern
ment to consult the leaders with a
view to obtaining more labor for ship
building-.
In reply Earl Curzon said the gov
ernment is now administering the
whole British mercantile marine,
amounting to half the gross tonnage
of the world. Forty-three per cent of
the British tonnage, he added, has
been requisitioned for naval and mili
tary purposes. 14 per cent is occupied
in carrying foodstuffs and raw mater
ial in behalf of the government and its
allies and the remaining 43 per cent is
being operated by British ship owners
under strict regulations.
"Our ships are carrying supplies of
coal, grain, food, timber, munitions and
the raw material munitions to all our
allies on an unprecedented scale," con
tinued Earl Curzon, "but for these
supplies to France, Russia and Italy,
they would be dependent upon their
own totally inadequate resources. In
several instances the shortage of ton
nage has been balanced by new ships.
It is surprising that we stood the
strain so well. Five hundred mer
chant vessels of all sorts are being
built and the number or small craft
added to the mercantile marine has
been more than 200."

Probe Agreements of Southern

Washington, May 4. Correspond
ence purporting to have passed be
tween Milton H. Smith, president of

of the Southern railway relating to an
alleged agreement to divide the south

by counsel for the interstate commerce
commission at today's investigation of
the Louisville and Nashville affairs.
In the correspondence the writers lik
ened themselves to Cortez and Pizarro,
conquerors of a new world, and met to
divide it, one agreeing to take North
America, the other South America,
neither to touch the isthmus and un
able to agree on Patagonia.
President Smith of the L. and N.
said he remembers no such corre
spondence and characterized it as
'rot."
Rad Picturesque Letters.
The correspondence was dated in
1896. and resulted. Chief Counsel Folk
of the interstate commission said,
from a meeting between Smith and
Spencer at Kennesaw, Ga., October 18,
1894. The first letter from Mr. Smith
to Mr. Spencer, Mr. Folk read into the
record as follows:
-Dear Sir:
"Pizarro: How shall we divide the
new world?
"Cortez: I will take North America
and you can have all of South Amer
ica except ano neither of us will do
anything to the isthmus without na
tice to and co-operation of the other.
"Pizarro: While Patagonia is not
a very large part of the world yet per
haps it is as much as I can tote."

WE DON'TNEED SUNDAY
The KvanRClist Says Topeka Is Good
Enough Already-
"I can't do any good in Topeka."
said Billy Sunday in response to the
efforts of Er. S. S. Estey and the Rev
E. W. Spencer to persuade Sunday to
give Topeka a Monday.
"Why I've used your town all over
the country as an example of what
prohibition does for a town. I can't
go in there and fight booze. It would
be like fighting the air. And a booze
sermon is the only one that is prac
ticable for a one day's service."
And then the baseball evangelist
cast several bouquets at the Kansas
capital- But he could not be per
suaded to talk in Topeka.
, Sunday never loses a chance to take
a shot at the brewers or saloon keep
ers according to Dr. Estey. The To
peka ministers were greatly disap
pointed by the failure to ."land" Sun
day but the flattering compliments
passed by the evangelist on Topeka
took the sting out of their regret.
