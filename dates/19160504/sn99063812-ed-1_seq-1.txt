LIBERATED HERE BY STATE
COMMI88ION " '
At last it has been solved, this mys
tery regarding the strange gamey fish
anglers have been catching ot late
In Link River rapids. These are-en-
tirelr different from the usual rain
bow trout, and they hare puzzled many
an old angler.
Deputy Game Warden Stout an
nounces that these fish are young blue-
backed salmon. Last year the state
fish and game commission hatched out
100,000 egga of this species In, the
county, and liberated the fry In Crys
tal. Creek, near "The Cedare.", ..The
fish are now eight and 'ten lnchea

tal'. Today Lorlmer announced that he

tenced to five yeara In prison. He la
out on bail, pending an appeal.

late In February, Lorlmer contended
that he waa Innocent ot irregularities
ot the details of tho management to
Munday.
Furthermore, ho contended that
sooner or later all who lost through
tho failures would bo paid in full.
His principal dofenso waa that the
fulluro of tho banks waa unnecessary,
and forced by a clique or oppoaiug
hankera to accomplish Lorimer s nuan-
clnl and political ruin.
Lorlmer baa had one of the mosi
rfranmtlc careers In the recoroa o
American doUUcb. Born In 1861, in
Manchester. England, ne cam-
America by ateerage; waa bootblack,
street car conductor, contractor, con
