THE PLANS
SEVERAL SITES
ARE CONSIDERED
Council, However, Decided to
Defer Action in This Mat
ter.
At a special meeting of the city
council held last night, Mr. P. J.
K rouse, of Meridian, was selected as
the architect for tlie new high who-d
building which is to be erected here.
Mr. Krouse submitted no specific
design, but after looking over the
situation and acquainting himse'f
with local needs will draw plans
commesurate with the requirements
here. Mr. Krouse is an architect of
proven ability and is by no means
unknown in Columbus, having
drawn plans for several local build
ings, among them being the Elks'
Home, the Frances Flats, an annex
to the First Methodist Church, and
the home of Mr. S. B. Harris.
In addition to selecting an archi
tect, he board also considered the
question of a site, bids having been
submitted as follows: Col. Hum
phries, lot corner of College and
Seventh streets, $8,000; Mrs. E. N.
Hutchinson, lot corner of Main and
Tenth streets, $7,000; J. T. Wood,
lot on Military, $5,000; J. G. EV.is,,
lot corner Main and 13th streets;
S. D. Lee Home, $15,000; Aldridtre
home, Seventh street and 5th ave
nue, North, $11,300; R. R. Stockard,
lot corner Third street and Third
venue, South, $10,000 ;J. M. Street,
lot corner of Second avenue and
Sixth street. North. J7.000 E. S.
Moore, lot corner of Third avenue
and Te. th a-rett, North, prk not
given ; D. M. Richards, lot corner of
Ninth street and Fifth avenue,
south, $9,000. None of these bids
however, have been accepted, action
of this phaseof the matter having
been deferred.
Mr. I. T. Gaston was awarded the
sprinkling contract for the ensuing
year at the same rate which he now
receives.
Bonds in the sum of $50,000
which are to be issued for the
erection and equipment of the new
hitrh school building were sold at a
special meeting of the city council
which was held Tuesday afternoon,
having been purchased by the In
terstate Trust and Banking Com
pany of New Orleans. This concern
paid a premium of $2,020 for the
bonds, which will bear interest at
the rate of five per cent.. The bid
ding for the bonds was quite spir
ited, rfo less than 18 offers having
been submitted by brokers and
bankers residing in different cities
throughout the country.
The question of selecting an ar
chitect for the new building, was
taken up at the regular monthly
meeting of the council Tuesdny
night ( but no decision in the matter
was reached, the entire session hav
ing been consumed in listening to
propositions and proposals from the
different gentlemen who sought the
job. There were nine of these gen-

CLASS TO PRESENT WELL
KNOWN PLAY.

lege chapel at 8:15 o'clock, the

to distinguish themselves in their
remarkable dramatic ability.

old country custom that the eldest
sister wear green stockings to the
wedding of a younger sister. The
play shows how the eldest girl,
Celia, in a large family of mis
chievous girls, thwarts the schemes
of iier Makers to coined Lcr U wtMtf

CLOSE CONTESTS
ARE IN PROSPECT
Teams Will Play Here Friday
and Saturday, and Large
Crowds will Witnett Games.
A great deal of interest is being
manifested in the two games which
are to be played here Friday and
Saturday by baseball teams repre
senting the Mississippi A. and M.
College and the University of Ala
bama. The interest is by no means i
confined to local fans, but passes
beyond the corporate limits of the
city and permeates two states, peo
ple throughout both Alabama and
Mississippi being -deeply interested
in the outcome of the two impend
ing contests.
Both the A. and M. College and
the University of Alabama have
many graudates in Columbus, and
the alumni of both institutions are
pulling for their teams. The games
are being freely discussed in clubs,
in cafes, on street corners and
other places where young people are
wont to assemble, and wagers are,
is is said, being freely laid upon the
outcome.
Columbus has no regularly or
ganized baseball club, and practi
cally the only games played here
this season have been those in which
college teams were the participants.
Interest in games of this character
has been continually growing and
the number of spectators have in
creased gradually, the crowd which
sembled at Lake Park ball field
last week to witness the game which
-V'aiiiheje bv "Ole Mis. &x,A
the "Aggies" Having . been the
lurgest of the season, and the num
ber of spectators on Friday and
Saturday promises to be still larger.

Hi-rr von Jagow, the foreign minis
ter, at the re-opening of the sitting
of the budget committee of tht
Reichstag today, said that the gov
ernment had not yet reached fina
decision with regard to the situa
tion that had arisen from the Amer
ican note to Germany regarding!
Germany's submarine campaign. A J
soon as the imperial chancellor re
turned from headquarters, Herr
Jagow added, he would give the

The foreign minister said the gov

of the American question, wouh
have been glad to make a statement
regarding the status of the problen
but that for the reason stated thH
was impossible.
Washington, May 3. The Ger
man reply to the United States ha
been prepared in outline. This wa
learned today from an authorativJ
soune.
The reply proper is expected t
be brief. Intimations of its content
have reached Washington and th'
important features are expected t
be:
First An assurance that Ger
many will conduct her subamrinH
warfare in accordance with th
reef'gnized rules of lntcrnati',ni'
law. ibtse rules must be define 1
init .n I'eneral they" requiro that v4

and that provisions must be mad
for the safety of passengers anJ

Second Changed conditions o
naval warfare will be referred t
and mention will be made of modi
ficutinns of the rules of warfare b;
u'l the belligerent countries an
notably Great Britain, who has ari
tempted to institute new rules o
Morkadf.
Third An announcement th
Germany is ready and willing t
discuss with the United States d
tails of the issues involved in th
submarine controversy. These d
tails would relate to the indefinit
and vague expressions contained i
the note to Germany. One of th
demands was that "present metr
ods" of submarine warfare
abandoned. There is no definitio
of "present methods," but German
may understand that phrase
meaning incidents such as the alli
ed attack on the English Chann
Steamer Sussex which was singlt
out by President Wilson for speci;i
mention in his address to Congres
