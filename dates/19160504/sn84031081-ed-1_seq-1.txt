The president and his advisers are
keeping their minds open while they
wait for the German note. The delay
very evidently has created a bad im
pression, however, and it was stated
authoritatively today that the issue
would have to be cleared up this
week if diplomatic relations with Ger
many were, to continue.
The president is known to be unal
terably determined to adhere strictly
to the position assumed by the United
Stales in Us demand that Germany
Immediately declnre and effect an
abandonment of its present methods
of submarine warfare.
Must Ho No Evasion.
No proposal of any kind will be
accepted by the American govern

declaration of intention to stop sink

the disclosure of the .nature of the In

submarine Issue with German offi

Tho Mexicans sny that In view of

that period of time.

In the meantime, It whs pointed out,
there will be constant movements
northward of American detachments,
so that when the final order for with-
draw I comes there will be only aj,
part of tho present expeditionary I
force left on Mexican soil.
Answers to the long dispatches sent
today to Washington by General
Scott , and f ljuerelnro by General

ceived here Ix-fore tomorrow. In case
the terms settled . tipoti by General

though the forms llty of another con
