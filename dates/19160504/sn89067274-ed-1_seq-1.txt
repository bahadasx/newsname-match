J FOB forty "years to our certain

Lifidently believe that the time has
irrijed when everybody agrees that
L must have some real money to get
isolts. We do not believe that it is
fesMry or even best to build mac-
liam roads, but feel that gravel arid
irt mixed together with an oil
Lning or topped with tarvia would
gale the cheapest and in the long run
k bent roads; There Is no way we
trow of to get this money except by

URGES NECESSITY OF IM
IS NURSES IN SCHOOLS
Dr. a Blank. Telia Mothers at
Baby Welfare Week Sessions
That It is a Necessity
DEMONSTRATES A PULMOTOR
Dr. J. C. Mosre Vrgcs That Baby Be
Fed From Breast if You Would
Have a Strong Child.
One of the most important things
in a complete school system, one that
is of greater necessity almost than
anything else is an examining nurse.
This statement was made by Dr. C.
L. Blanks at the Baby Welfare Week
meeting Monday afternoon at the Mc
MUten High School Dr. Blanks
stressed the importance of watching
the growing child's health for it play
ed not only a prominent part in its
future but in its immediate school
work.
Dr. Blanks also demonstrated the
pulmotor and explained its value to
the community in which such an in
strument was owned. He made a
most interesting talk on the eye, ear
nose and throa. He especially dwelt
upon adenoids and the many troubles
that develop among children directly
traceable to them. '
Dr. J G Moore spoke upon malnutri
tion among children. He urged that
when ever possible the baby should
be breast fed. This is the natural
manner in which the child should re
ceive its nourishment and builds
greater strength than bottle feed
ing. He said the great trouble with
many school children was that they
were given the wrong food at the
wrong time. He urged the inspection
of milk as a duty we owe society.
He stated that ninety-five per cent of
the infant deaths in this country were
due to infected milk. Quite a lot of
this infection comes from the too
numerous house fly.

day in ihe South Side school and the
North Central school were splendid
features of the work being done by
the Federation of Clubs. The atten
dance at both schools was exception
ally large and the programs were
both delightful and instructive. The
meeting at the library Wednesday
afternoon when the prize awards
were presented and Miss Stanley, of
the State University spoke upon Do
mestic Science, was largely attended.

dent was in charge. Miss Karnes'
pupils rendered several songe, de
lighting everyone with the melody
and enthusiasm. Miss Zola Beat's
pupils gave a dramatization of k

and object of the Mothers Club. She
called attention to the fact that ex
perts are provided by the state to
furnish information concerning agri
culture, stock raising, fruit growing
and in fact along almost every line
except the care of the child.
Then came a delightful little pro
gram by the children of the differ- j
ent grades. A chorus by pupils, of
the third grade, was much enjoyed.
A dramatized story was given by pu
pils of the fourth grade. This was
beautifully done. The children spoke
clearly and distinctly and with abso
lutely no self consciousness.
A duet by sixth grade pupils, which
was especially pleasing, closed tho
children's program. Both the Moth
ers ana teachers are to be congratula
ted upon the excellent work done
by the South Side School the past
year.
Mrs. Snoddy next made a most in
teresting talk on "Good Reading for
Children." This was given in her
usual charming and polished style,
and was very practical and very much
to the point .
Mrs. W. J. Botts gave" a few of
her own experiences on reading to
children.
Mrs. C. F. Clark, who was to have
given a talk on the "Better Babies'
Contest" was called out of town,

she sent her paper and the Mothers

37,000 HEAR BILLY SUNDAY
Evangelist Denounces Those Who
Have Been Circulating Reports. -
Kansas City, May 2. Thirty-seven
thousand persons went through the
rain yesterday to hear Billy Sunday
open a seven weeks' meeting here.
"Come on you forces of iniquity in
Kansas City", he said, replying to at
tacks that have been made on him,
"come on you traducers; come on, you
triple extract of infamy; come on you
assassins of character; come on, you
sponsors of harlotry; come on you de
famers of God and enemies of the
church; come on, you bull-necked,
beetle-browed, hog-jowled, peanut
brained, weasel-eyed four- flushers,
false alarms and excess baggage. In
the name of God, I challenge you and
defy you. It. is mighty easy to lie
about a man when he isn't on the job.
I'm here now for seven weeks. Come
on and 111 deliver the goods, express
prepaid.
"The dirty, black-hearted, rotten,
degenerate whiskey bunch in Kansas
City has been lying about me.
"I understand the fellow is here in
this tabernacle tonight who sent
those lying circulars out about me.
Stand up, you dirty dog, stand up till
I cram that lie down your' dirty
throat."

We have moved to the Greer Building, opposite
Ringo Hotel, next to Graham's. Nice location, and
business is starting off in good shape; but we find our
room small for the stock we carry, and while we are
compelled to buy some new goods, we are making
some attractive prices to reduce some lines. Below
we mention a few:
Gas Stoves, Lawn Mowers
Screen floors
Also a Long Lin v 4 Screen Wire
Please do not buy that Oil Stove until
Vo' ?e what we have.
Also that Refrigerator.
A share of your patronage will be appre
ciated, and we'll do our best to please.
