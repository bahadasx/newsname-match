Kf, i'A.SO. TEW, May 3.?Mexican
military men believe that the with
?1 rh?? a 1 of American troop* from Mex
ico will take place in about two
lU'tithe, it was learned here to-night.
American officers will make no com
ment on the subject.
The Mexicans say that, in view of
the dispositions to be made by Gen
^rai Obregon in co-operating with
A trierican forces according to the ten
tative agreement made with General
Kcott, the hunting flown of the bandit
groups In Chihuahua and Durango can
scarcely take more than that period
of time.
On assurances from General Car
ranza that the bandits are dispersed,
the northward movement of American
troops will attain full tpecd. and it
will not be long until the last trooper
crosses over the international boundary
line. In the meantime, it was pointed
out. there will be constant ..movements
northward of American detachments.
ho that when the Una! order for with
drawn I comes only a part Gf lh<> pres. |
rnl expeditionary force will be left
on Mexican soil.
Answers to the long dispatches sent
ro-dav to Washington by General
Scott and to Queretaro by General
ObreRon were not expected here before
to- morrow.
If the terms are approved by Presi
dent Wilson and Genernl Carranza. the
{?regent negotiations practically will
be concluded, although the, formality
of another conference will he gone
through to-morrow night or Saturday.
\n MOVEMENTS UNTIL
ACBEKMEJiT IS SIGNED
?It is probable that no American
troop movements will be begun until
th*- formal signing of an agreement
by the two governments, or at least
until General Carranza has signified
his acceptance of the stipulated condi
tion#.
After that, however, tho American
nnd Mexican troops are expected to be
gln a co-operative campaign that will
effectively stamp out the various ban
dit groups.
It IP generally understood here that
th? first step to he taken will be a
gradual retirement northward of the
American troops while the Carranza
troops plunge into the campaign
against the Villa bandits. Columns
now In the neighborhood of San An
tonio will fall hack to Guerrero and
later will proceed to Namiquipa. From
that point regiments will bo gradually
detached and transferred to CoJonla
> Dublan, until finally the whole force
occupies a restricted zone along the
border.
While the Carranza forces are sweep
ing through Southern Chihuahua and
1 >u ran go, the Americans will be look
ing after stray groups operating to
the north. It is understood that. Gen
eral Obregon is pledged to throw every
available man of his military strength
into the. hunt for the various maraud
ing bands. It is believed that almost
the entire 2.">,000 men will be use.d to
protect the American border, in case
the Americans agree to withdraw.
The railroads will not be utilized for
the withdrawal, nor will there be any
?need of the railways for the shipment
of Mipplics.
U'fl<!' MAKE KVEItV EFFORT TO
AVOID CLASH WITH MEXICAN'S
American troops are to keep out of
all towns and cities, and every effort
? to avoid conflict with Mexicans will be
made. The retirement of the Amer
icans will be dignified and contingent
upon th? effect on the Mexicans.
Following his conference with Gen
eral Obregon yesterday, lasting twolve
hours. General Scott snatched a few
hours sleep to-day and then started
to work on a report to Secretary of
War Baker, which was not dispatched
until late to-day. Tt was thought
probable that the report might not be
presented to President Wilson before

Number of Dodd's Men j
Go Up Mountainside \
With Knives in Teeth
Man-to -M an F ighting
A mong Mountains of Chi
huahua, Where Bandits
Seek Refuge.
FIELD HEADQUARTERS, April 29
fby motor courier to Columbus, N. M , ?
May 3).?There was man-to-man fight- j
Inc. and some of the Americans went I
up the mountainside with knives in .
their teeth, during Colonel Dodd's '
battle with Villista bandits on April
22 at Temochic.
"It was the devil's own playground," I
was Colonel Dodd's description of the
terrain of this battle In Southwestern
Chihuahua, among towering mountains, ,
where 150 bandits sought refuge.
For two hours Dodd's troops of the I
Seventh Cavalry fought from an im- I
mense hollow, with bandits on three !
nldcH, charging deliberately over [
ground marked with bullet puffs in the J
dust all about their feet, where the i
Mexicans had their exact range. They J
accounted for at least fifty bandits ,
killed or wounded, against an Amerl- 1
can loss of two dead and three wound - .
ed. C?nn Mexican woman was wounded :
by bandits.
Two nights before this fight the
Americans overtook the bandits nt the
Yoquivo Mine, where they were lying
about the camp fires, telling the na
tives stories of how they claimed to
have whipped the Americans at Co
lumbus and at Guerreio. Thoy showed
big lumps of gold and sliver taken
from Mexican towns, which, they as
serted. were spoils of war
Shortly before midnight an outpost
ran in breathless, exclaiming: "The
Americans are coming in!"
LIVES OK AMKRICAXS
SAVED BY THE SEVENTH
Scores of dark forms leaped tnrough
the firelight, bugles blow, and in ten
minutes the whole bandit command
had galloped out of town. When the
cavalrymen came in, they found two
American mining men, a Mr. Seyferth
and another, who had paid ?2.000 ran
som to the bandits, and whose lives
probably had been saved by the
Seventh's arrival.
These Americans said the bandits
were led by Candelero Cervantes,
Jesus del Itios, ?"ruz Dominguez and
Manuel Baca, who was killed by a
Mexican the following Sunday after
the fight.
Among them were followers of Julio j
Acosta and General Beltran. They
were remnants of ail the best known ?
Villa commanders' veterans, and at
that time, at least, the last known
band of Villa's men whose nerve had
not been shaken by defeats at Colum
bus, the Guerrero and Aguascalientes.
On Saturday afternoon at -1:30 o'clock !
Dodd's men. arriving at the southern i
rim of the hills forming the cup in '
which the town of Temochlc lies, saw
the rear guard of bandits riding out
of town. Ahead of them they saw
the main body waiting behind rocks ?
to give battle A machine gun was
placed to sweep this ridge, while the
Americans rode down Into the cup In
pursuit They dismounted in town, !
: advancing on foot, with rifles ready, !
[ led by Troop I,, and accompanied by
I the two guides. i
I While still in town, a trooper was j
i hit and mortally wounded. The shot j
| i-ame from the flank, from a cave in 1
the mountain overlooking Temochic.
| Out of a big adobe chimney the troops
pulled a sniper, the only one caught ,
1 in the place.
In the town Troop L advanced to j
within range of the crests above. They
? crossed the range in short rushes. \
! lying down and tiring, then advancing
j a few yards.
BULLETS FALL CLOSE
TO EVEItY AMERICAN"
; Colonel Dodd, with his staff, rode
; through this zone, while bullets fell
within a yard or two of every man
j until they arrived at a small knoll i
. beyond the town. From here Dodd ]
i directed the fight. Another machine'
gun was brought up close to play on I
.'the force at the crest in front of the ]
? knoll. Out along the Amcrlcati line a \
; trooper was lying on his stomach
: firing. His comrades saw a bullet I
I strike forty feet In front of him, and
i then another popped twenty feet ahead j
| of him. In a moment a ball .struck
' DItr? In the head, killing him. A licu
| V?"?nt lying among his men directing
j the fire, was wounded.
Meantime, the. Americans had gotten
j the range of the Mexicans on the crest,
j and checked their tire. Several frcsh
t ly made graves on this crest, found
j next day, testified to (lie Americans'
aim. One Mexican leader, on a gray
horse, rode into sight on tho sky lino
half a dozen times, but seemed to be
a charm against bullets. His gray j
mount was the last living object the j
Americans distinguished before dark
ness ended the fighting. This horse i
was found wounded next day at Santo
Tomas, where Manuel Baca, tho Villa
leader, was killed by Leondro Alvarez,
a Mexican pacifist, for the price of
20 pesos (about $7 American money).
The Mexicans said this horso was
Baca's. t

WBSTIIAMITOX AN I OKA I.
SITI5 KOIt niCi SPECTACLE
If one who had known and lived with
'Shakespeare had. sought to-day to
select in Amcrica a spot where his
name and time could have been brought
in review, Westhampton would have
' been his choice. It is remindful of
j England, of Avon's , stream, whore
Shakespeare in his boyhood's days
; must, like other hoys, have whiled
I his time away; of the commons which
? surround London, where, perhaps, the
hard wandered of a summer's after
noon with her who was nearest his
affection; of the hedges in the long
| lanes where the Hawthorne blossoms
and the pansy rears its head; of the t
park, remembered of all Londoners. |
where, perhaps, the boy William played '
on the g/-een anil drew the Juice of i
' sword blades between his teeth.
Westhampton has its lanes and its'
by-ways, the groves of oak which
Shakespeare, knew, and, here and
there, small spaces where the butter
cup and daisy grow, as Shakespeare i
must have known them if ever he ]
; wandered afield; elders and red maple,
a patch of cedar, and a wide expanse '
of water. He was born on the banks j
of the Avon, and when he went to i
London he learned the Thames, and
must have seen in its farther reaches
such water lilies as grow to-day near
the banks of Westhampton Lake.
COLLEGE BUILDINGS RECALL
SCENES IX OLD EXGLAXD
The college buildings, too. might
remind one of England, and call to
recollection a few in old St. John's
wood, some on the upper Thames, and,
in a way, bring back to memory
I Wordsworth's "Prospect of Eton Col- j
| lege." which Shakespeare never saw.
Westhampton Is amply fitted for the
; part. On its grassy lawns, in its
j groves of trees and down by the lake.
? with the city as n f:>r background!
i may be portrayed in proper style every
incident in Shakespeare's life, from
i the time he first wandered down to
i Avon until he went to London and if
j tradition be true, held horses for a
? tip. A short concrete bridge crosses
j the runway from the lake, and it does
, not take a long stretch of Imagination
| to believe for the moment that It Is
i London Bridge, with Ludgate Hill
j stretching a way.
; Ludgato Hill rises to the fore, and
? at the approach the walkwav is lined
j with shops, shops with dormer win
dows and small window panes, as may
jbe seen in some quarters of London
j to-day. President I?\ W. Boatwright.
,of Richmond College, who is in im
personate Shakespeare, niav, in his
?dual personality, wander down to the
! bridge and remember that one spring
j night 3t?0 years ago he stood here and
(watched heavy laden barges toil up-!
I stream and saw India's vessels veer
joft ."or tho East India docks.

dents in Shakespeare's life, will be!

the commons and dignitaries of thei
past. A complete list of all the parti-'
cipants comprises about 2,000 names.!
Queen Elizabeth, who delivered favors I
as she dispatched heads, will be among
the throng. King James, represented
by G. Jeter Jones, will walk among
the commoners, and Quern Anne, im
personated by Mrs. George L. Street,
Jr., will mingle as the. Queen never

President F. W. Boatwright, of Rich

hospitable at all times. Me must be

and with recital of broken Walsey's

MADE UNTRUE ESTIMATE
OF SI>.v FEI.V MOVEMENT
|JJ\ BlrreU When he KOt a hearing,
aid ho would have an opportunity as
a Private member of taking part in
the debate on the Irish rising He
candidly admitted that he had made
an untrue estimate of the Sinn Fein
movement, and the possibility of dis
j turbances such as had occurred in
j Dublin, especially in respect to the
| mode of warfare which had been pur
sued and the desperate folly displayed
I by the leaders and their dupes. He
[therefore, at the moment he learned
from Sir General .lohn Maxwell that
'the Insurrection had been quelled,
placed his resignation in the hands of
the Prime Minister, and It had been
[accepted.
He wished to say to his critics that
| he error which he acknowledged,
j which had been of great and terrible
iconsequence, had not proceeded from
I any lack of thought, consideration on
I anxiety. From the outbreak he tools
tt to be only his duty to maintain un
broken and unimpaired if possible, the
position of Ireland as a whole to the
common foe. l? that hope and aim
he had been gallantly assisted by Mr.
Kedmond. Ho knew the difficulties
were great and the ice thin. But h?
considered it to be his duty to run
great risko, in order to maintain In
[Ireland herself, and in the face ofl
Europe a picture of unbrokon unanlm,
y within the boundaries of her soil.
hopes that new HONDS
OF UXIO.V 5IIGHT BE FORGED
Mr. Birrell said that when he viewed!
the smoking ruins of Dublin and th?
ruins of his own ambitions, there was
one sad hope In his heart, that thia
was no Irish rebellion, and that now
bonds of union might be forged.
rhe Prime Minister, in making nota
of Mr. Birrell's statement, said he was
sure the House had heard Mr. Birrell
not without emotion and sympathy,
and he assured Mr. Birrell that ha
possessed in a peculiar degree the af
fection of h 11 his colleagues.
Mr. Redmond said that tho wholo
business in Ireland had been to him a
misery nnd a heartbreak. He paid
warm tribute to Mr. Birrell. Ho felt
that he himself had incurred some of
tho blame which Mr. Birrell had laid
at his own door. While approving the
vigorous quelling of tho rebellion, Mr.
Redmond begged the government not
to show undue harshness to "tho great
mass of unfortunate dupes involved."
