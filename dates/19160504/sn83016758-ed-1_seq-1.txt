"THE HOLY CITY"
A Sacred Cantata, to be Rendered at
the Princeton Armory Mon-
day Evening, May 15.
Cambridge Choral Union Will Present
Production With Which it Has
Delighted Many.
A real treat awaits the music lovers
of Princeton and vicinity. The Cam
bridge Choral Union will present
"The Holy City," a sacred cantata, at
the Armory on Monday evening, May
15.
This is the third consecutive season
that the Cambridge Choral Union has
been in operation, and it has delighted
Isanti county audiences time and time
again. At its last appearance before
a Cambridge audience, this spring, the
commodious court house hall of our
neighboring village did not begin
to hold the immense throng that turned
out, and a second rendition was given.
The chorus contains over 60 well
trained voices, and is directed by Mr.
C. H. Southerland. An out-of-town
tenor soloist, Mr. Paul Bloom, who
has been identified with various cho
ruses, quartets, etc., of the Gustavus
Adolphus college, accompanies them. A
five-piece orchestra will also add to the
enjoyableness of the program.
In "The Holy City" the songsters of
our neighboring village are at their
best, and we have it on good authority
that it is the most pleasing production
they have ever presented. Besides
choral numbers, there will be vocal
solos, duetts, quartets and orchestra
selections.
This will be the first appearance in
Princeton of this organization, and
the Union bespeaks for our neighbors
a cordial reception. We have no hesi
tancy in stating that those who attend
will enjoy every minute of it.

Monticello vs. Princeton Saturday.
The ball game to have been played
here Saturday between the Prince
ton and Elk River high schools was
cancelled, as the grounds had not been
in condition long enough to give the
locals sufficient practice. Next Satur
day, however, the season will open,
when Monticello will invade Prince
ton.
The indications are that the local
institution of learning will have a
well-balanced ball team in the field
this season. The infield has shown
I ^up fast in practice, and the outer gar
dens are in capable hands. Lester
Jesmer and Neal Grow will shoulder
the bulk of the defensive work from
the slab, and Jos. Kaliher will be at the
receiving station.
Saturday will give the public its
first' opportunity to see the boys in
action, and a generous attendance is
hoped for.
Charged With Blind Pigging.
As a result of a raid made on the
premises occupied by Fritz Kunkle in
north Princeton, Sunday, a charge of
blind-pigging has been preferred
against him. Sheriff Shockley, his
deputy, Henry L. Shockley, and acting
Marshal Fox made the raid. Just
what evidence was securedf has not
been disclosed, aside from the fact
that four beer cases and bottles were
taken. Only one of the bottles, how
ever, was filled with the amber fluid
that made Milwaukee famous.
Kunkle was arraigned before Jus
tice Dickey on Monday afternoon, but
no plea was entered, and the case was
continued to next Monday.
If action is brought under the pro
visions of the Minnesota county option
law, the case will not be triable in
justice court, but County Attorney
Myron informs us that it will be
brought under the old law, which gives
a justice of the peace jurisdiction.
Princeton has been in the "dry"
column for over two years, but this
is the first arrest for violation of the
liquor laws within that time. That
the laws have been violated is pretty
generally conceded, but proof has not
been forthcoming. Just now there is
considerable talk of other arrests to
follow.
Kunkle may or may not be guilty of
the offense charged, we know not. But
we do know that long before Kunkle
located in the village it was notorious
that intoxicants were easily obtainable
here. If the law is to be enforced, and
it ought to be, let it be enforced against
all alikeagainst the biggest as well
as the smallest toad in the blind pig
puddle.
The Dublin Riot.
Poor old Ireland's latest rebellion is
a thing of the past. It lasted just
seven days, and was confined to the
city of Dublin. But during those seven
days property valued at $10,000,000
was destroyed, and it is estimated that
fhe or six hundred of the misguided
rebels were killed and over one thous
and wounded. A number of policemen
and soldiers and a few civilians were
also killed. Several hundred of the
rebels have been shipped to England
where they may be tried for treason.
The "outbreak" must have been
plannedif there was any plan to it
by irresponsible madcaps. Any sane
person must have known that there
was not the remotest possibility of the
movement succeeding.
What the poor, deluded, unorganized
rioters hoped to accomplish is not ap
parent. Blind hatred of England
seemed to be the only motive that
actuated them.
Four of the leadersPatrick H.
Pearce, James Connolly, Thomas J.
Clark and Thomas MasDonaghwere
tried by court martial, found guilty
and shot in London yesterday morn
ing.
Sir Roger Casemenc is still a pris
oner in the Tower of London.
Augustine Birrell, 'chief secretary
for Ireland, has resigned.
Law Unconstitutional.
As the Union anticipated the su
preme court has held that chapter 168
laws of 1915 is unconstitutional. This
is the law that extended the terms
of clerks of courts in several counties
two years. The object of the law was
to have the terms of all clerks of
court in the state expire at the same
time, hence the terms of about 30 of
the clerks were extended to the first
Monday in January, 1919, virtually
giving them a six-year term. The re
sult of the decision will be that the
terms of all clerks of court who were
elected in 1912 will expire on the first
Monday in January, 1917. The deci
sion affects the clerk of court of this
county. I^the present incumbent de
sires to retain the office he must be
re-elected this year.
The Two Extremes.
The Minneapolis Journal takes the
extreme view on road building and
favors vesting the state highway
commission with the powers now ex
ercised by county boards. The other
extremists favor a return to the old
township system. We favor the pres
ent law with the county as the road
building unit to either of these. There
may be some slight changes neces
sary, but in the main the law suits
us up this way. We are getting good
roads, and doubt if we could get them
better or more of them for the same
money under a more centralized sup
ervision.Roseau Region.
Dr. Wheaton Dead.
Dr. Charles A. Wheaton, for many
years regarded as the leading surgeon
of the Northwest, died at St. Joseph's
hospital, St. Paul, last Saturday. Ow
ing to ill health Dr. Wheaton was
obliged to retire from active work
several years ago.
Atrocities Continue.
If the war is actually responsible
for the high skirts worn by the fe
males, it is hoped the war will soon
be brought to a close in fact the
skirts have almost reached the limit.

April 27th was a red-letter day in
the history of Rochester, proudly
termed by its citizens the "biggestjittle
city" or the "littlest Big city" (we have
forgotten which) in the world, and her
residents, together with those of ad
jacent cities and towns farmers from
the country-side, and prominent citi
zens from every part of the state
took a-day off and turned out to hear
their old neighbor and fellow-towns
man, Frank B. Kellogg, sound the
key-note" of his senatorial campaign.
Rochester is a remarkable city, oc
cupying a unique place among the
cities of the state. The Mayo Broth
ers, by their marvelous attainments in
surgical science and their wonderful
jtact in gathering into their magnifi
cent hospital the cream of the world's
.specialists in their respective lines,
have made Rochester known wherever

the healing of the nation on its wings.
Rochester and the adjacent coun
try, early in the state's history, was
settled by a sturdy type of men and
women, intelligent, industrious, moral
and intensely religious, religious in the
old-fashioned way, each sternly parti
sap to his own creed, and so many
edifices were required to accommodate
the- different denominations that the
town became known as the "City of
Churches."
Ifpturally this character of popula
tion begot a strong, virile, ambitious
secpnd generation, who made their
mark in the history of the state and
nation. Probably no other Minnesota
county has produced more men and
women who have been influential in
public affairs and potential in national
matters than good old Olmsted.

to form their early impressions and

more than fifteen miles in circumfer

is the city of Rochester.

They knew Frank B. Kellogg, when
as a farmer boy, clad in a straw hat,
overalls, cowhide boots and a smile he
sturdily aided in wringing the family
subsistence from the old Kellogg farm
in Viola township in the days when
farm operations were carried on by
main strength and not with machinery.
They knew him as an earnest,* grub
bing student at the old stone sdhool
house during the three months winter
term. They remembered him when
he "teamed" thirty miles across the
country, hauling wheat to the nearest
market to put living funds into the

feeble health of thev
father, was in a
chronic state of depletion when he be

was thoroughness, who hammered the
fundamental principles of the law into
the young student's head with such
painstaking pertinacity as to give him
a foundation in legal lore such as few
lawyers of the present day possess.
They minded how he would study
law for a while and then go back and
work on a farm at thirteen dollars a

wondered how he could ever spend

They recall the time he entered into a
partnership with young Burt W. Eaton
who studied law in the adjoining office
of C. C. Wilson, in the law firm of

timers in one group whose aggregate
age was four hundred and twenty
years, and formed them into a junior

to write. Mr. Kellogg's address has
appeared in all the papers. His speech
was carefully prepared and he laid
his manuscript on the table, placed
his glasses on top, and then never
looked at it, but the address he de
livered was better than the one given
to the press. It bristled with facts and
sparkled with epigram and its salient
points were roundly applauded. His
platform in substance was:

A number of Minnesota's noted

we did not hear them bound. We had
an engagement at the Elk's Club to

We have attended meetings more
wildly enthusiastic, where more red

and more blustering done, but never
one where there was a more kindly,

Village Council Meets.
The village council met in regular
session last evening with all members
present, and Mayor Newbert presid
ing.
On motion duly made, seconded and
carried it was decided to have the side
walk adjoining the residence of Mrs.
Mary Rines, torn up by order of the
council last year, replaced.,
The matter of paving Main street
came up for consideration, and was
discussed, but no action was taken. It
was decided to have a committee
named to investigate the paving prop
osition thoroughly, and submit a re
port, and the business men who own
abutting property will also be con
sulted in the matter. The probabili
ties are that concrete or creosote will
be used.*
Kaliher & King put in a claim for
$150 for injuries sustained by one of
their horses, which plunged into a pit
in the street near the Riverside gar
age a few weeks ago. The claim was
laid over until next meeting.
Corey Bros'. Shows applied for a
license to operate a merry-go-round
and shows here May 15 to 20, inclu
sive, and the fee was fixed in the sum
of $35.
It was decided to use the large
whistle in sounding the alarm of fire,
the department having requested this.
The fire department was granted
permission to take the chemical en
gine to the cemetery for protection
while clean-up work and burning is
being done.
On motion $60 was voted to the fire
department to defray the cost of send
ing three delegates to the state con
vention at Chisholm next summer.
After acting on the usual grist of
bills the council adjourned.
New Packing Plant at St. Paul.
St. Paul people are jubilant over the
new packing plant which Armour& Co.,
of Chicago, are to erect in'South St.
Paul. The business men of St. Paul
have subscribed a bonus of $500,000
to the project, and it is expected that
the plant, which will cost $2,000,000,
will be in operation by the first of the
year. With two large packing plants
in South St. Paul, the stock-raisers of
the Northwest, ought to have a good
market for their cattle, sheep and
hogs. But what effect will the build
ing of the new plant have on the pro
posed farmers' packing house?
t, Scott-Wahlfors.
Mr. Washington Scott and Miss
Olga Wahlfors of Greenbush secured
a license to wed at the office of the
clerk of court, Tuesday morning, and
were immediately united in marriage
by Rev. C. Larson. The groom is a
successful young farmer, and the
bride is a young lady whose pleasing
ways have won for her a large circle
of friends. These estimable young
people have the felicitations of all who
enjoy their acquaintance.
