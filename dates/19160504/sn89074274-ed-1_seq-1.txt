Tbe following Is being published in
the state papers with a Minot date line
as the true story of the reported at
tempt to get L. S. Platou to withdraw
from the race for the Democratic nomi
nation for governor. Mr. Platou on
"Tuesday informed the Times-Record
that he had never been approached in
«ny way in regard to withdrawing, so
the published story is untrue in this
one particular, at least. How much of
the rest is pipe-dream remains to be
-seen. At that the story makes inter
esting reading. The article follows:
John Bloom, E. H. Stenvik and
George McClure are said to be the
three men responsible for the recent
attempt to do something to F. O. Hell
strom in order to eliminate the "Big
Noise" from the senatorial race in
Democratic circles.
The real season for the attempt to
-get the land office at Minot for D. H.
McArthur is said to be because John
Burke refused to attempt to carry with
"him McArthur for the governorship. So
other arrangements had to be made
and made quickly. There was only one
thing to do—McArthur must be taken
care of and the best available position
was the Minot land office, which had
T)een promised to George McClure.
McClure was under obligations to
Halvor Halvorson who, by reason of
"his nationality, and because he has
•kept himself fairly free from the Dem
ocratic melee, was figured to be accep
table to all factions, except perhaps
the Equity Democrats. To get them in
line Olson of Valley City was picked
for the candidate to run for secretary
•of state on the Democratic ticket.
Neither Olson nor Dr. Platou were con
sulted until after the petitions had
been printed for Halvorson, Burke, and
Olson.
One E. Goltz was selected to ghost
Dr. Platou and the doctor was simply
told that he would be taken care of in
some other way and what right had he
to run and attempt to split the Nor
wegian vote against Halvorson?
Stenvik having laid his plans then
went and secured the resignation of
•Corget, the present incumbent of the
Minot land office, to take effect at
once. The petitions of Burke, Halvor
son and Olson were put into circula
tion, a meeting of the Democratic cen
tral committee called and formal ac
tion taken endorsing the three men for
these positions.
Immediately afterwards Stenvik de
parted for Washington to put McAr
thur through and to fix up things so
that Platou might have a federal ap
pointment of some kind.
But there is a hitch in the program
and so many protests have been receiv
ed against the deal that the adminis
tration is in despair just what to do.
It is said that there may be a repeti
tion of the Pembina appointment,
•where McArthur was salted and then
at the last moment another name was
sent through, leaving him out in the
cold.
Platou has absolutely refused to eli
minate himself and the harmony
crowd is waiting until Stenvik returns
before attempting some other way.
Platou figures that if he secures the
nomination he stands an excellent
chance of being elected. The disinte
gration of the Norpartisan league may
not proceed apace. It is an open se
cret that if the leaders of the league
fail in their attempt to capture the
Republican party they will vote the
Democratic ticket in the fall, provided
they can hold their followers to this
program.
Platou has always kept on friendly
terms with the society of Equity and
the league officials and is said to have
some assurance that he would make a
very acceptable governor, in case
Frazier is licked.

City Council Meets
in Regular Session
The city council met in regular ses
sion Monday evening with all the mem
bers present.
After the reading of the minutes of
previous meetings the reports of the
various departments were read and ap
proved.
The contract was approved for a new
pump for the pumping station, the suc
cessful bidder being the Hanks-Price
company of Minneapolis. A road grad
er was also contracted for. The Valley
City Courier was named the official pa
per for the ensuing year.
A proposition of considerable inter
est came up when the Commercial club
asked the use of rooms in the city hall.
Their plan is to make the club strictly
for business consideration and to elim
inate the social feature. There appar
ently was no opposition to the use
of the rooms by'the club, and just at
this time there is a fine chance for it
to co-operate with the city and citi
zens for the accomplishment of indus
trial possibilities.
The council also arranged with the
Municipal band to give a series of con
certs in the park during the summer.
Curren Gets Contract
for Parochial School
On Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock
the members of the building committee
of the'111 proposed St. Catherine's pa
rochial school met at the parish hall,to
open the bids and let the contract for
the new building.
With Darby O'Malley elected as
chairman of the board, the following
members were present: Thomas Gass
man, James Kelly, Phil Schoefter, Matt
Kaiser and Father Baker.
The following were the bids entered:
The Johnson Construction Co.,
Fargo, N. $23,997
R. B. Marschke, Lucca, N. D— 23,945
T. F. Powers & Co., Fargo ... 23,556
W. J. Curren, Valley City 18,514
The contract was awarded to Mr.
Curren, and building operations will
commence immediately. The building
will be uptodate in every respect, and
will worthily line up with the many
other substantial public buildings of
our city.
With the heating and plumbing the
building will cost about $23,000, and
will probably be ready for use in the
fall.
Plans for this building were drawn
by E. H. McFarland.
Medina Man Held for
First Degree Murder
Jamestown, April 29.—John Miller
was given a hearing Saturday before
Judge Bigelow on the charge of shoot
ing and killing Valentine Hens on
Christmas day, after which he was
bound over to the district court on the
charge of first degree murder.
Miller had been waiting in the coun
ty'jail four months and seven days for
the outcome of his deed, but was not
informed of the fact when the Hens
boy died. He knew nothing of the
proceedings of the coroner's jury.
When Sheriff Wright told him a day
ago that Valentine Hens was dead, Mil
ler took the news calmly and cooly.
Throughout the whole hearing Sat
urday morning and afternoon, he sat
without moving a muscle, gazing at
the wall without letting his eyes drop
once. He heard the testimony of his
brother and his father and Dr. Artz,
but was not called upon the witness
stand, personally, but when Judge
Bigelow stated the fact that he was
bound over to the next term of district
court on the charge of murder in' the
first degree, he rose quietly and for
the first time smilingly greeted some
of his friends and then went back with
the deputy sheriff to await the term
of court.
He was not offered a chance to get
out on bail.
Chas. McGee autoed up from Oriska

Community Hall for
Dazey Now Assured
Dazey Commercial: The committee
which was appointed to do the solicit
ing of subscriptions for the Dazey
community hall got busy this week
and started the ball to rolling. Only
four parties so far have been solicited
but the donations have exceeded the
brightest anticipations of the most op
timistic while the pessimists who pro
phesied failure for the undertaking
have been forced to close up their
howling. The first four subscribers to
the subscription list gave $500 and the
committee has bright hopes of getting
several others to give the same
amount, in fact it is believed that the
people of the community will sub
scribe so liberally that a hall of ample
capacity to take care of the needs of
this community for many years to
come can be built and only 60 or 75
per cent of the subscription will need
to be collected.
The move is one of the biggest that
has ever been undertaken in the com
munity and it will be one of the big
gest benefits to the community that
could possibly be constructed. It will
furnish an everlasting monument to
the good works of the donors and one
which the on-coming generation can
point to with pride.
The committee in charge of the so
liciting reports that the sentiment is
very strong in favor of the hall and
that thus far there has hot been a re
fusal. The work proceeds a little
slow as each member of the commit
tee is busy with other matters and it
is only at short intervals that enough
of them can get together to interview
different citizens for subscriptions.
Each week we expect to give a full re
port of the amount subscribed, thus
each reader will know how the work

Landmarks Day Proves
Very Interesting Event
The Sorosis Club held a very inter

the home of Mrs. Edwin Mayland on
Tenth avenue. It was "Landmarks
Day," and there was a good attend
ance. Mayor Moe could not be pres
ent to give his talk on "Pioneer Days,"
and this subject was ably discussed
by D. W. Clark, whose talk on "Early
Reminiscenses of Valley City," was
greatly enjoyed by all. Miss Minnie
Nielson gave a talk on "Collecting
Barnes County History," and Mrs. B.
S. Spurr spoke on "Landmarks." Mrs.
Wylie Nielson talked before the Club
on "Reminiscences and Early Settlers
of Valley City," and Mrs. W. T. Cras
well sang the old pioneer song, "My
Little Old Sod Shanty on the Claim."
Views and pictures of Valley City
taken in the early days, as well as
scenes of the surrounding country,
were shown. Mrs. W. J. Westergaard
had charge of the program, and it was
indeed a splendid one. The next
meeting of the club will be held in
two weeks, and the place of meeting
will be announced later.
ESTABLISHED 1«Tfc
Washington, April 29.—Dishonest en
forcement of the Minnesota grain in
spection system was charged by Rep
resentative Young of North Dakota
today in the debate on the grain
standardization bill. In supporting the
pending bill, 'Mr. Young declared that
"half a loaf was better than no bread,"
though he expressed some doubt that
this bill was even half a loaf.
Referring to Representative Ander
son's description of the manner of in
specting grain in Minnesota, Mr.
Young said he told how the Minnesota
commission operated, but not what
kind of measure they used.
"We claim in North Dakota that in
Minnesota for years they have used
a dishonest, crooked measure." Mr.
Young said, "A measure that did not
grade at all."
He insisted that some grades, re
jected under the Minnesota system,
were practically of the same value as
the accepted grades, and that if "there
was a fair inspection system, every
grade when it is ground into flour and
the product sold should get tbe same
amount of profit."
North Dakota members favored the
passage of the present bill, while it
was opposed by Minnesotans.
As a member of the agricultural com
mittee, Representative Anderson to
day led the fight to modify and amend
the grain standardization bill, so as to
protect the Minnesota state grain in
spection system.
Arguing in favor of an amendment,
to provide for licensing state inspec
tors by the government, instead of
throwing the appointments wide open
to any one qualified to inspect grain.
Mr. Anderson declared that the pres
ent measure might "wipe out the entire
inspection system of Minnesota," and
lead to the "appointment of inspectors
not authorized under the state sys
tem."
The house wrote into the annual ag
ricultural bill provisions for uniform
grading of grain and for a permissive
system of warehouses under federal
supervision, but did not reach a final
vote on the bill itself.
Kathryn Floor Mill Assured
Kathryn Recorder: At the meeting
of the stockholders of the Kathryn.
Farmers' Elevator Co., held last Sat
urday to consider the advisability of
purchasing an elevator, and consider
the building of a mill, it was decided to
purchase the Andrews Grain Co. ele
vator. The proposition of building a
mill developed very little opposition
and when the question was put to a
vote it was carried practically by an
unanimous vote.
The board of directors were in
structed to procure a site for the mill
and concrete elevator. The subscrip
tion for stock has been progressing so
favorably that there is no doubt that
the financial part will be taken care of.
Still the required amount has not yet
been subscribed for and all who are.
interested in the project should see
Mr. Walker and help the thing along.
A committee consisting of K. O.
Abrahamsen, Cedor Olson and J. C.
Thoreson was appointed to recommend
amendments to the by-laws.
