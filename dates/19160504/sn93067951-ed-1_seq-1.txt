I minutes iuter at least one of th
culprits was under arrest.
It is the opinion of the polfc
thai more than one person wa
engaged in the robbery but t
Edate the only arrest made i
that of Coot Stanley, a wel
H known negro, who was only re

Harmonious Co
Unanimously
For the first time in many
years the dove of peace hovered
over the Chesterfield County
Democratic Convention as it deliberated,
listened, spoke and
voted in democratic unity last
Monday at the Courthouse.
The convention was called to
order by M. J. Hbugh, esq , at
12 M. W. P. Pollock, esq., was
elected temporary president and
W. P. Odom temporary secretary.
On motion the chair appointed
Messrs. II. E. Rivers, 1
-I. Sidney Smith annd M. M. 1
Johnson a committee on creden- 1
tials. The temporary roll of the 1
convention was offered by this
mmiiiiiuee ana me same was '
adopted. *
Members of the Executive '
Committee are: M. J. Hough,
Chesterfield; C. E. Prince, Che- 1
raw:F. D. Futulerburk, Dudley;
W. J. Odom, Odom's Mill; J. L. !
Baker, Patrick; D. F. Brock, '
Brock's Mill; M. C. Lancaster,
McBeo; J S. McGregor, Ruby; '
M. M. Johnson, Jefferson; T. ? . (
Johnson, Angelas; J. R. Burn, 1
Bethel; J. C. Rivers, Mt. Crog- 1
han; G. H. Gulledge, Cross '
Roads; I. R. Melton, Snow IIll 1; '

L. Moore, Wexford; W F- Mc- 1
Bride, Grant's Mill: W. R. Johnson,
Middendorf; J. R. Sutton,
Douglass Mill; Theo. Winburn,
Ousleydale.
The temporary organization, '
un motion, was made permanent
and the additional officers neces- 1
sary, were elected. Hon. G. K.
Laney was made vice-president, ,
and to the secretary's duties was
added that of treasurer,
M. J. Hough was made Chair- (
man of the County Executive (

vim MJlVVW* If 1*. OtfVCIIMMl
was elected a member of the
Slate Executive Committee.
The following resolution, offered
by Mr. M. M. Johnson, of
Jefferson, was, on motion by
Mr. 1J. A. Murray, Jr., unanimously
adopted:
Resolved, That W. P. Pollock
be endorsed as delegate from the
State Convention to the National
Convention, and that he be
elected to the State Convention
by acclamation.
When this motion had been
enthusiastically carried Mr. Pollock
responded with a masterly
address that was frequently
punctuated by applause.
A resolution introduced by P.
A. Murray, Jr., favoring the
county-to county canvass, was,
after amendment by M. M.Johnson,
substituting the word "instruct"
for "urge," adopted.
The Hon W. P. Pollock was i
j _ -i i a a i i r*.
maue a delegate to ine state
Convention by resolution.
The following were elected by
acclamation as delegates to the
State convention: D. S. Matheson,
G; K. Laney, li, B. King,
M. M. Johnson, K. H. Blakeney.
The following alternates were
elected: J. S. Smith, J. C. Hirers,
R. W. Gaddy, and Win,
Godfrey.
One of the neatest tributes
paid to any man during the convention
was that paid to Mr.
D. S. Matheson when he attempted
to withdraw his name
as a nominee as delegate to the
State Convention. Mr. C. L.
Ilunley had put Mr. Matneson's
name in nomination and when
the latter requested Mr. Iluuley
to withdraw his name. Mr. Hunley
arose and in a brief ami eloquent
speech refused and before
Mr. M&lheson could make further
protest the vote was put and
he was elected by acclamation.
The following resolution wan
Rubmitted by P. A. Murray, Jr.,
| in behalf of the Courthouse
Club:
Whereas, in these troubleous
times and unsettled conditions,
the destinies of thin nation have
b<en fraught with danger; and,
Whereas, we realize that in the
unty Democratic
Endorses Wdsor
person of Ilis Excellency Wood- b
row Wilson, President of these b
United States, we have a man at jg
the head of affairs, both compe- h
tent and able to steer the ship tl
state through the troubled wa- a
ters in which she is laboring; u
and. Whereas, we desire to ex- a<
press < ur appreciation of his a
manly and logical handling of d
the situations which have con- b
fronted him, and our confidence
in his ability to handle any situ- e:
ition which may arise; We, the ti
members of the < 'hesterfield V
County Democratic Convention, a
in meeting assembled, do here- sc
by endorse the wise and manly S<
course of our President, and do sc
:ommend him for his clear-sight- te
ad judgment, and his wise and vi
intelligent handling of all'uirs as ni
the head of the nation. 01
Whereas, Hon. W. F. Stevenson
is a candidate for the House hi
>f Representatives of the United cc
States; and. Whereas, fully ap- a;
preciating the ability, the lr
character and attributes ot the
said W. F. Stevenson, and fully p<
realizing that his election to hi
Congress would not only reflect V\
aredit upon Chesterfield County, w
but upon South Cirohna and the sj
nation as well; We, the mem- ei
bers o f Chesterfield County k
Democratic Con vention, in meet- ai
itig assembled, do hereby en- w
dorse the candidacy of W. F. In
Stevenson, and do commend him ct
to the voters of the Fifth Congressional
District. nl
Whereas, at the recent session M
of the General Assembly of this w
State, Senator Geo. K. Laney la
and Representative W. 1\ Odom c(
were the joint authors of a bill y<
called the Laney-Odom or AntiCompact
Law, which precludes bi
the tire insurance companies in ti
this State from combining for ti
the purpose of illegally fixing j"
fire insurance rates; and Where- a
as in our opinion this law will tc
piove of inestimable value to in
the people of this State, and is a C(
great piece of constructive legis- tl
lation; We, the members of C
Chesterfield County Democratic p
Convention, in meeting assem- ft
bled, do hereby en forse the ac b
tion of Senator Laney and Kepre- gi
sentative Odom, and commend gi
them for their allegiance to, and tl
deep interest in the people of of
tnis state, ana, we do also ex- h
press our appreciation to. and do ti
commend any other members of ft
the Ge teral Assembly who aid- c<
ed or assisted in the passage ?<f is
this bill.
Whereas, we deem it to be the t<
best interests of the people of t
this Stale that we have the t
county-to-county campaign for v
State offices; and. Whereas, in
our opinion the overwhelming e
majority of the people of this e
State are in favor of it; and, v
Whereas, i<i our opinion this is ti
the only fair and logical way to r
conduct a State campaign, as a
the people have an opportunity i<
of seeing the candidate face to
face, hear him present his qu&li- ^
(ications for the office, and such f
a campaign is conducted in the ^
open, and is the foundation of t
democracy ; We, the members o> e
the Chesterfield County Demo- i
cratic Convention, in meeting as- s
uont Klo<i /1a a??rl/vi*oa -1

to-county campaign, ami do in- e
struct the delegates whom wo
elect to the State Convention to 1
jdo everything in their power to j
see that the State Convention c
does not change the present plan s
of campaign. I
After the reading of the reso- c
lotions endorsing President Wil- j
son's administration and endors- t
ing the Lion. W. F. Stevenson
for Congress, Mr. Stevenson was t
invited to Rpeak. Before he 1
arose Mr. Hough moved that 1
the speaker &be allowed unlimi- i
ted lattitude. (
It was here that the perfect i
harmony of the convention became
evident to all. There had <
Convention
v ' y
i and Stevenson
een no dissention at any time
'lit the hearty applause that
reeted the speaker every time
e scored a point showed that
lie convention was with him to
man. They thrilled with pleasre
at the mention of the
chievements of our president
nd the mention of his own canidacy
Was the signal for an out
ust of applause.
Mr. Stevenson referred tr? liis
xperiences at the State Convenon
four years ago when Mr.
Wilson was spoken of as being
n idealist, a n impractical
ihool master. Sentiment in
:>uth Carolina was by no means
>1 id for him. Now, he said, af r
nearly four year years of serice
as chief executive of the
ition. Democracy speaks as
le man in praise of Mr. Wilson.
He was a school master," said
e, "a master who was able to
mtrol a Democratic Congress
i he had controlled his classes
i school."
It was thought that a practical
ilitician was needed. Put we
ad a man of that character at
Washington in 1881, said he, and
hile the speaker would not
leak in disparagement of Grovr
Cleveland, he said what is
tiown to all men, that, as great
id powerful as Mr. Cleveland
as. he was unable to manage a
Duse overwhelmingly Demoatic.
The speaker told his audience
: how in spite of terrific odds
r. Wilson has succeeded in
riting more constructive legi3
.tion than all other presidents
unbilled during the last fifty
ears.
He dwelt at length on the
atiking system put into opera
on by the Wilson administraon.
Then taking up the subset
of rural credits he expressed
fear that a measure satisfao>ry
to the president and of nerlanent
usefulness to the farmer
iuld hardly lie passed before
le adj uirnment of the present
ongress. Mr. Stevenson exlained
in some detail the deicts
of the measures at present
efore the House anil and then
ave some conception of the
reat benefit to be derived by
le small iarmer trom the typo
f rural credit legislation that
e has himself favored for some
mo, that the president now
ivors and to which the party is
:>mmitted but. for which there
i small hope at present.
The speaker paid his respects
j Wilson's masterly handling of
he tariff situation and of th<
rying crises in our relations
nth Mexico and with Germany.
The crowd was with him at
very turn in his extemporanous
but masterly address and
rhcn he referred to Chester
eld's opportunity to have a repesentative
at Washington the
pplause.was vociferous and p>:oDnged.
M. J- Ilough, e?q., followed
ir. Stevenson as the spokesman

dr. Stevenson for Congress 11 i*
ribute was one of those spontanons,
frank, unreserved outpour
ngs of eulogy that, only a plainpoken
devoted admirer can proluce.
lie was applauded to the
(cho. /
Mr. Pollock then spoke from
lis own exderience on the suboct
of Mr. Stevenson's Candida;y
and though displaying a tine
unso of humor in mentioning
lis many legal battles with tlie
candidate paid a glowing and ap
jreciated tribute to his ability
ind character.
The repolutioii endorsing Wil
ion and Stevenson was seconder
>y representatives from many o
:he County Clubs. The ontiri
'esolntion submitted by tin
Hourthouse Club, was unani
mously adopted.
The resolution in regard to th<
:andidacy of Capt. W. T. Throw
er for Kail Uoad Commissioner
was adopted. /
The petition of I'ee Dee Township
requesting a new voting
precinct, was referred to the executive
committee with instructions
to establish conveuie; t
voting precincts.
On motion of Mr, G. K, Laney
<?ne of the pleasantest and most
harmonious Democratic Conventions
in the history of Chesterfield
County adjourned.
Excellent Wort Done
!n Recent Civil Court
After two full weeks of the
best work done by any court in
Chesterfield in many a day, the
spring term of the Court of Common
Pleas, presided over by the
able and courteous Judge S. W.
C. Shipp, adjourned Saturday
evening.
The last important case tried
was that of II. It. Whitman vs
the Seaboard Air Lino Railroad.
Mr. Whitman sued for damages
on account of injuries suffered
when he was struck by a train
Aug. J, 1011. Whitman was a
a station agent at Kolloeks and
on the night, in question went to
fill a switch lamp, lie sat down
on tne end ot a cross tie and
either fainted or fell asleep.
While unconscious he was struck
by the train. Dr. Bull, of Columbia,
testified that Whitman
sulfered from a dislocated hip,
stilt knee, twisted ankle and
running sore on leg; that he will
never bo well. The railroad denies
liability, claiming Whitman
was careless and had fallen
asleep. Whitman claims that he
fainted, being weakened by over-work.
The jury rendered a
veidict m Whitman's favor for
.$10,000. Motion for new trial
wa? made.
