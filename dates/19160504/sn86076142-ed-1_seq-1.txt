EUROPE ARE POOR
A case of more than ordinary local j
interest w as decided yesterday by
Judge AverilL. The case waa entitled
John Pingree vs. Helen M. Rulison.
The plaintiff is a banker of Ogden and
the defendant is a practicing dentist,
of Tonopah. She was located in Gold
field in l'.Mig during the days of the
Rawhide boom. In February of that
year she purchased 12,000 shares of
Block In the Rawhide Red Top Mining
company owning the Red Top Frac
tion claim in Rawhide. The stock was
ttold to her by one W. H. Scott, at that
time of the brokerage and promotion
firm of Scott & Amann of Goldfteld.
Miss Rulison paid 12V4 cents per
share or $1,500 for the 12,000 shares.
Several months thereafter she Dor
rowed $500 from Scott and gave him
her note with Interest at one per cent
per month. About two or three months
after giving the note she learned that
the stock was not treasury stock ana
was absolutely worthless. At the time
of the purchase, the court finds Scott
made very extravagant claims res

The note came due and as soon as
Miss Rulison found out that her stock
was worthless she repudiaited the
note. Scott negotiated it to Pingree.

turlty of note, the defense of fraud,

who would not under such circum

gree sued and Miss Rulison defended
by alleging the fraud of Scott. The
trial of the case occupied a number of
days in the district court and the court
found that Miss Rulisons version
was correct; that she was the victim
of gross misrepresentations made by
Scott for purpose of Inducing her to
buy the stock; that while it was rep
resented that she was to have treasury
stock, no such stock was in fact sold
