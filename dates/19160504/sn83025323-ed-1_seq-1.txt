HORSE STOLEN WEDNESDAY
DEPUTY NELSON GETS THIEfF.
One of the boldest thefts ever re
corded in this section of northern
Montana occurred in Malta Wednes
day morning. When the Patton boys,,
who operate a dray line in this city,
went to hitch up their teams they
found one of their best horses was
missing. The sheriff's office was
notified at once and Deputy Sheriff
Nelson proceeded to get busy at once
A farmer and his wife from the
south country came in about seven
o'clock and when they learned of the
robbery of the horse the lady remem
bered having met a young fellow on
a gray horse about six miles from
Malta and when they approached
him he turned his horse down a cou
lee and staid there until they had
passed.
Deputy Sheriff Nelson got his car
and took up the trail at once, leav
ing Malta about ten o'clock in the
forenoon. He started for the bad
* lands near the Larb Hills, and about
3:00 p. m. came up on the young
man with the gray horse at the Spen
cer ranch where he had stopped to
rest his hard ridden steed. The man
was Ray Schumacher, a well known
Malta boy, whose parents are highly
respected and reside in the Black
coulee section southeast of Malta.
On being brought to the Phillips
county jail young Schumached made
a confession to the officers, in that
he was the one who broke into the
Koke harness shop this winter and
stole a. saddle, spurs and several
" other articles. He took Mr. Koke
and the officers to the cache and
9 everything was found as he said. The
saddle he used in trying to make his
9 escape on the stolen horse Wednes
day.
Schumacher is being held in the
Phillips county jail and will be giv
en ,a preliminary hearing this week,
on the latter charge of grand lar
ceny. He is a young man and pre
vious to this has always bourne a
good repui.attion.
M1ANY 1'III ;T' HO:.II'S
IN THIN CITY NO W.
While the business interests of
Malta have grown to a great extent.
since Malta becanme a county seat,
B there has also been a steady growth
in the number of new homes erectel
g and today Malta can boast of as
tmany nrew homes as any city along
the line.
Back in south Malta on High
street during the past year the old
landmarks have disappeared as if
by magic and in their stead we find
a row of pretty cottages and modern
bungalows. Commencing on Fifth
avenue and walking east along High
street the first home of note is the
new bungalow erected by O. F. Mc
Kone, the Buick man. It is one of
the substantial homes of the city and
finished in the very latest pattern.
Mr. and Mrs. McKone have been oc
cupying their new home for about
a month and are more than pleased
with it.
The next mdern home in the row
is that occupied by Mr. and Mrs. P.
A. Laramy, a neat little five-room
cottage that was built by J. F. Mur
ray about eighteen months ago and
has been occupied by the Laramy
family since their arrival here.
Further up the street we find the
new home of Henry Plott. This was
completed this spring and is without
question one of the prettiest bung
alows in Malta. It is modern
throughout and cost the owner quite
a neat sum of money, but the satis
faction of having a home to ones
liking is well worth the price. The
house was built by Contractor Mc
Caughin.
On T-iinh O rooft oaaf .f Tiff], n +n_
Un -igRh street east of Fifth ave
nue are more modern homes includ
ing those of Willi.nm and John Tress
ler, Mrs. Caselberg, J. F. Kilduff, L.
C. Edwards andt he McLellan home.
All of these have beautiful lawns
which adds greatly to the appearance
of the homes. At the end of the
street is the large roomy home of
John Survant, which is also onel: of
thi best houses in the city.
