Pittsburgh, May 4. E. M. H-arr, j
president of the Westinghouse Electric j
and Manufacturing Company, whose
plants are closed because of a striko of
15,000 workers for an eight-hour day,]
told a committee of strikers to-day
that he would be unable to discuss a
settlement with them until to-morrow.
Federal and State officials are en
deavoring to bring ihe company and
the men together.
While almost a thousand State
troops were on duty in the Turtle
Creek Valley and conditions about the
closed plants were quiet, unrejst was
manifested in other parts of Allegheny
county. Seven hundred Pressed Steel
Car Company employes joined the
2.000 already out and the police were
guarding the factory of the McKinney
Manufacturing Company, on the North
Side, where girl-strikers attacked those
who refused to join their strike :md
ducked one of them in a horse trough, i

Militiamen on Strike Duty
Will Be Ordered to Give
Two Band Concerts Daily
Reports received at the State
Capitol up to an early ho.ir this aft
ernoon from General A. J. Logan in
command of the National Guardsmen
on duty in Allegheny county were to
the effect that all was quiet and that
arrangements were being made to
have the bands attached to the militia
give two concerts a day at their quar
ters. This coupled with the reports
of the really cordial treatment given
to the Governor's Troop and the
other cavalry are taken to mean that
things are in good shape.
Word came here to-day that the
manufacturing companies would not
attempt to operate plants with strike
breakers and that their chiefs were
bring urged lo listen to mediation
offers. The State is represented by-
Patrick Gilday and James A. Steese,
of the department of labor and in
dustry. who have with them attaches
of the department specially detailed,
and men from the United States De
partment of Labor.
The Erie Railroad has given notice
that its employes called out on
military service by the State will be
given leave of absence for the time
with pay and regular vacations be
