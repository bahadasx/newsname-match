M. H. S. WINS AGAIN
In Declamatory Contest at
SpringfieldInspector
Praises Work Here
What do you think of Mans
Held winning again this year the
gold medal in the inter high
school contest anion); t he schools
of all Southwest Missouri? List
year at Drury College, Bertha
Miller easily won first plane, and
Thursday evening Hazel Burney
won at the Normal, in competi
tion with seven other schools, by
a unanimous decision of the
judges. Manslield has the ma
terial to win next year if the
proper effort is made. Anions
those who were present at the
contest and track meet at Spring
field lust week were Prof. .J. A.
Hyllon, Hazel Burney, Mrs. (J.
S. Hurney, Velum Hylton, Ralph
Hylton, llorvo Coday, Jasper
Craig.Frank Hoover, Ben (! rover,
Snyder Craig, Dewey Edwards
and Garrett Carter. Others who
belong at Manslleld, but who are
temporarily living in Springfield
who enjoyed these events were
Mrs. Hylton and Paul, Blanche
Hurney, Frank Hudson and fam
ily, Mae Hopper, Fiona Rippee,
Rinda Rippee, Raymond New
ton and Earl Slate.
I P. Callaway of Jefferson
City, state high school inspector,
spent the day with us Tuesday
and seemed to enjoy our work
greatly and to place a high esti
mate mi the conditions in gener
al. He talked to the high school
and grammar grade students af
ter recess in the afternoon and
gave most excellent advice to the
students, especially those who
will be in school next year. It is
especially gratifying to the stu
dents- and teachers in the high
sel,,tl ii, liui'j tlie work here
ranking decidedly higher than
that done in many places where
a four years course is given.
The junior class program at
i.ssemlily Monday morning was
a very entertaining one, although
only live members of the six
were present and that made it
impossible to give some of the
piano numbers. This class, for
the number of students in if,
shows more variety of ability
than any other class in school.
The seniors will have charge
during the assembly period next
Monday and will, no doubt, give
us the best program we have
had t his year. The members of
this class are quite busy these
days, but if they do what they
are capable of doing, patrons as
well as pupils and teachers will
enjoy their program.
The attendance in all grades is
good. Most of the primary folks
who have been out on account of
chicken pox and measles are in
school again. The lirst reader
class is not so large but they are
doing excellent work memorizing
a poem entitled, "The Swing."
The regular eighth grade ex
uininations are being given this
week and we will soon know who
is to he promoted to high school
next year. Those who have been
faithful will succeed; the idlers
will fail.
The high school and the gram
mur grade students were given
a quarter holiday Friday after
noon because of the fact that no
one was tardy in either room
last month.
The primary folks made May
baskets Monday. They are en
joying working with the sun
bonnet babies, but the sun
doesn't shine as much as they
like.
The sixtli grade history class
had a test lately in which average
grades made were "E," which
means from HVfo to !", a re
markably good record.
The intermediate grades gave
a literary program Friday after
noon and had the lirst primary
pupils ns their guests.
The alumni association met
Monday night and made arrange
incuts for the annual banquet to
be given May 13.

Cities which have not held shows
for years are preparing to give

WE "CLEANED UP!"
Monday and Tuesday Were
So Observed The Park
Flowers Look Fine
Monday and Tuesday were
clean up days in Mansfield and a
large amount of trash was gath
ered up all over town. This cer
tainly adds much to the looks
and hoalthfulness of the city.
There are still some places that
have not been cleaned up. It is
the desire of the city officials
that this cleaning up he done at
once, so that when the trash is
hauled away next week the job
may be a thorough one. All
trash that is ready to be hauled
away when the wagons call will
be hauled away at the expense
of the city. Won't you do your
part and be ready for tlie wagons
when they call? Do it now.
Tlie Boy Scouts, under the di
rection of Scoutmaster W. H.
Fullington, did good work by dis
tributing circulars calling upon
the citizens to observe tlie clean
up days, and also by selling fly
swatters. The park has assumed a most
pleasing aspect as a result of the
work done by Mayor F H. Riley,
assisted by other citizens. Sev
eral attractive flower beds now
adorn the park and add much to
its beauty. Flowers purchased
for the park this year cost $14.00,
and between $0 and $7 has been
subscribed for the payment of
this bill. Any one who has not
already paid 25c on this bill and
wishes to have a part in this
good work may leave the money
at this office and it will be ap
plied ou the bill. We are all
proud of our park and 25c is a
small amount for each one to pay.
Won't you help?
Phoebe's Diary by Kink
Aug. 4 -Saturday afternoon.
Oh, such a ravishingly beautiful
sunset as I have been watching
from our porch swing. That
lovely pink paints the western
sky like blushes on the cheeks
of a girl, and those first stars
that twinkle out make me think
if their eyes when their best
beau tells them he loves them
more dearly than anyone. Henry
told me that last night and asked
me if I didn't care a little grain
for him. His big, melting, brown
eyes were eloquent with passion,
and the moonlight was enchant
ing. I had the most delicious
little thrills running up my spine,
but 1 said, "No, of course I don't,
and I wouldn't wear my heart on
my sleeve if I did." I thought
he would beg and plead for my
love, like they do in novels, and
ifter I had enjoyed tantalizing
him awhile, I meant to relent.
But nothing doin'. He politely
wished me good evening and de
parted, leaving me like a crushed
lily. At first I cried a little; then
I thinks to myself: "You little
fool, if he loves you like he pre
tends, he'll be back tomorrow
fairly radiating apologies and
begging to be forgiven." So with
my hair puffed and coiled in the
latest, and my rose-sprigged
ilress and yellow sash on, I've sat
here the whole afternoon reading
Vanity Fair" and eating pepper
mints, and waiting to forgive my
dear Henry. But the evening
wore away and not a soul passed
up our brick walk, that was so
prettily marked off in the em
broidery work of the lilac leaves,
except a bum wanting a piece of
pie and a tinware peddler.
Oh, it's a hard, cruel world,
full of disappointments and sor
row. A poor, lonely girl has no
chance at all. She is like a leaf
on the ocean wave, tossed about,
to and fro, til some handsome
prince comes along and picks
her up. When her fingers glitter
with his jewels and a long dis
tinguished title is tacked onto
her name, all those friends"
who have snubbed her when she
was just plain Miss So and So,
crowd around her and drop
words hke sweetest honey into
her ears and say Ivnv delighted
they arc.
I'm rather sorry about my
rude spepch to Henry. Tomor
row I'm going to call him up at
tlie office and ask him to come
down.
Aug. 5 Sunday. I believe my
heart is broken. Oh, why was I
ever born? My good intentions
are thwarted; my efforts are
fruitless; my ambition is crush
ee and hope seems dead in my
heart. This morning it soared
high in my breast. The birds
sang and all nature seemed glad;
the golden sunshine lay like a
benediction over the land. With
sweet hope singing in my whole
being, I tastefully arranged our
little parlor, putting music on
the piano and games on the ta
ble. In fancy I could see my
Henry sitting in the deep leather
chair opposite me, smiling and
forgiving; and I sang little scraps
of song as I dusted. Then I cal
led up the office. No one answer
ed. I called his residence and
was told that he was out. "Tell
him to please call "13" when he
comes in, t said, with blazing
cheeks. Then I waited oh, that
dreary, anxious waiting. Time
sped on. but hope whispered,
Perhaps he will come without
calling." So I waited on. About
the middle of the afternoon as I
sat drumming on the piano and
feverishly watching the road, a
great, black car came spinning
b, with two people sitting in it.
One was a woman, a perfectly
lovely creature, with great, dark
eyes and tun cherry lips tnat
wore a bewitching smile. The
heavy plumes on her hat brushed
her cheek. She raised her won
derous eyes to her companion's
face, and with a keen throb of
pain I saw it was Henry.

KILLED AT WEBB CITY
Marion Brim Meets With a
Fatal Mine Accident
Burial at Fordland
Marion Brim, a son in-law of
Mrs. May Ross of Mansfield,
was hurt in a mine accident at
Webb City Thursday, dying Fri
day from the effects of his in
juries.
He was born July 13, 1887, at
Paola, Kas., removing the same
year with his parents to near
Fordland, Mo., where he resided
the greater part of his life. He
was married May 20, 1911, to
Berdie Potter. To this union was
born one child. He is survived
by his wife, daughter and step
son, besides his mother, .three
brothers, three sisters, and many
other relatives and friends, who
deeply mourn his loss. In ac
cordance with a dying request,
his body was brought to Ford
land for burial. Mrs. Ross and
daughter attended the funeral.
At the time of his death he was
28 years, 9 months and 15 days
old. The bereaved ones have tha
sympathy of our people in their
great sorrow.
Friday's Joplin Herald gives
the following account of the sad
accident:
Caught by a slab that fell
without warning from the roof
of the Cumberland mine, Marion
Brim, a shoveler, yesterday af
ternoon received injuries that
ended in his death at the Jane
Chinn hospital at 8 o'clock this
morning. The body was taken
from the hospital to the morgue
of the Steele Undertaking Com
pany, where Coroner A. R. Sny
der held an inquest at three
o'clock this afternoon. The in
juries that caused death were in
the head and back. Grim was
!)5 years old, and is survived by
a wife and two children, who are
living at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry H. Bridges, 704
North Walker street. The fam
ily lived here for several years,
but had been away for a time,
and only recently returned to
Webb City from Wright county,
Missouri. The body will be tak
en to Fordland, about twenty
miles east of Springfield, for
burial.
Fordland, Mo, May 1. The
funeral of M.G. Brim was held at
the home of his mother here yes
terday afternoon. The body was
shipped here Saturday. Accord
ing to the testimony of several
witnesses, the roof of the mine
in which Brim was working ap
peared in perfect condition and
also had been inspected daily by
the roof trimmer. The slab was
four inches thick in the center
and about twelve feet in length.
Brim was working almost direct
ly under it when it collapsed
Springfield Republican.
The Ava Record says Dewey
Kay has been re elected superin
tendent of the Branson school
and that Miss Fay Williams will
teach the Gentry school.
