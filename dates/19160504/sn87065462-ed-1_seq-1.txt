State Tax Commissioners Issues
Address to Tax-Payers.'
To the Tax Payers of M iss. :
The State Tax Commission,
created by the Legislature of
1916, has been duely organized
and Ju Entering upon its respon
sible duties earnestly solicits the
co-operation of every good citi
zen in its efforts to make its work
effective to the end sought in the
creation of this body, which end,
as we all know, was primarially
to correct the gross inequalities
prevailing in the tax system of
our State and to procure a fairer
and more equitable adjustment
of the expense of government.
The, object of the Commission
is not to increrse taxes, but to
reduce them; which we, feel sure
can be accomplished when all
property is required to bear its
just share of the tax burden.
Because this condition does net
prevail today, the tax levy is
v her than it should be, and the
property fairly assessed must
make good the deficit created by
that which is inadequately val
ued or not listed for taxation at
all. , .
Leaving out of consideration,
entirely, the ethical considera
tions of justice and equity, which
we believe animate the thinking
and doing of the vast majority
of men, direct self-interest should
prompt us, all, to find some
means of correcting the inequal
ities prevailing in our whole tax
system, which, like all other
abuses, grow greater from year
to year, as - time advances, and
usless corrected, their cumula
tive eOTiseqnens'? iost bp d'sa-'
trous to every interest. The
State simply cannot afford to be
unjust and unfair in the exercise
of the taxing power, which is its (
highest prerogative; every citi
zen should be made to feel that
he is treated exactly like every
other citizen in this respect, and
is bearing his just pro rata, nei
ther more nor less, of the cost of
government. When this confi
dence in the justice of our com
mon Mother is once established,
asit will be the purpose of this
Commission to establish it, we
believe that "Tax-dodging" will
become the exception, instead of
the rule, and a new ethical view
will prevail in relation to a prac
tice which is, today, not only
condoned by public opinion, but .
openly avowed and justified by
those pursueing it," as a necessa
ry measure of self-protection.
Ethics has no place in , tax pay
ing; the inequities and inequal
ities of our system has driven it
out. No standard of fairness or
justice prevails to command the
observance of men in filling out
assessment lists; each feels that
his neighbor is withholding all
that he can from the tax gather
er, and in justice to himself, he
must do the same thing; and of,
by common consent, no reproach
attaches to this line of conduct,
which, if practiced in private
affairs, would quickly bring men
into such intolerable disrepute
that they would want to move
away. - (
This condition, we will allj
agree, needs correction, and that'
is the object of this Commission; 4
for the attainment of which the j
earnest co-operation of every ;
fair-minded citizen is earnestly
solicited. " i
Yours for justice, ;

Okolona Again a Winner.
The Okolona High School
brought back the cup from the
j Feild meet held last Friday and
Saturday at the University.
This time it was on a tie with
both Meridian and Canton, both
, of which had won on previous
occasions, ukoiona oeing a new
serious contender entitled the
i local school to the custody of the
! cup for the next twelve months.
1 The successful contestants
which counted in making the
winning score were as follows:
100-yard dash Miller won
second.
Shotput Streibich won second
220-yd run Miller won first.
120-yd hurdles Miller won
first.
Half-mile relay Okolona won
third Team-McDonnell, McMil
lian, Streibich, Pogue."
Okolona furnished one of the
youngest if not the very young
est to qualify for the contest.
J. S. McDonnell, only 15, ' quali
fied in the 220-yard run and in
the half-mile relay and tied with
Philadelphia in the 100-yard
dash. J. S. has just entered
high school and by the time he
receives his diploma we expect
to see him bring home firsts in
more events than one.
We understand that it is the
purpose of the school to have
entries in every contest next
year and with the progress made
during the last few years we
may expect to give a good ac
count of themselves if they can
only have the proper backing
and support of the people of the
City. "Let's see that they" '.have
a good opportunity to defend the
trophies won and add to the col-
bction.

If your back aches because the kid
neys are blockaded, '
You should help the kidneys with
their work.
Doan's Kidney Pills are especially
for weak kidneys. .
Recommended by thousands home
testimony proves- their merit.
W. H. Hall, shoe & harness repair
er, Church St., Okolona, says: "I have
been severely injured in my back a
couple of times and I believe that was
the cause of my kidneys giving me
trouble. Bending over at my work,
no doubt, helped to make my' back
weak and painful. Several years ago
while living in Amory, I was bothered
that way and I used Doan's Kidney
Pills. They strengthened my kidneys
and my back stopped aching."
Price 50c,' at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney" remedy get
