"VERMONT FARMS"
U. S. Department cf Agriculture Points
Cut Value of Book.
Secretary of State Guy YV. Bailey
has received tiie following letter coin
niending his recent publication, "Y'er
mont Farms," pointing out its great
value to the rural school teacher and
its importance in bringing home to the
youth of Y'ermont the value of Ver
mont farm life:
Washington, April 27, 1916.
lion. Guy W. Bailey,
Secretary of State,
F.ssox. Junction, Vt.
Dear Sir: The copy of "Y'ermont
Farms." addressed to Mr. F. K. Ueald.
of this oliice, has been received and
examined with care.
He reports that this publication
would be of much value in the hands
of each rural school teacher in Y'er
mont, especially in connection with our
joint work in preparing a manual of
agriculture lor the same teachers.
If it is feasible for you to have a
copy placed in each rural school as a
part of the teacher's equipment, doing
this through the district superinten
dents, it would provide the basis of
reference work in agriculture and val
uable correlations in arithmetic, geog
raphy and history. Of course, the pub
lication should be properly stamped as
the property of the school and notice
given that this is a referetice text to be
can fully prererved and used.
Without a doubt you will agree that
it is more imnortant that the youth of
Vermont should appreciate the agri
cultural opportunities of the state than
that outsiders should know of them.
The rural t-cheol pupil may not always
be intended lor a fanner, but undoubt
edly many good tanners have been lost
to Y'ermont merely because they did
in t know the advantages of the Ver
mont farm life until after they had
entered misfit occupations elsewhere.
If you would find it. feasible to place
a copy of thhi publication in each rural
school, kindly notify us so that we may
make the reference to it we would like
to make.

DISPERSED
Substance cf Agreement Made by
Scott and Cbregon
WILL RETIRE GRADUALLY
Americans Will Move Northward as
Rapidly as Carranzistas Improvo
' Conditions in Mexico.
Kl Paso, Texas, May 3. The crisis
in the Mexican situation lias been
passed. In the twelve house that end
ed early this morning Major Gen.
Hugh L. Scott, representing' the Unit
ed States, end General Alvaro Obro
gon, Minister of War of tiie de facto
Government of Mexico, drafted a ten
tative agreement regarding the Amert
oan punitive expedition which went in
lo -Mexico to catch Y'illa and disperso
his bands.
Another conference is to be held,
probably tomorrow, but this will bo
only a formality unless some unfore
seen circumstances arises. The provi
sions of the tentative agreement were
not announced, but it is understood
they meet the requirements of both
Governments and that no definite dato
is set for the retirement of American
troops from Mexico.
Although American officers will not
discuss the arrangements, Mexican
military men believe that the with
drawal of the American troops will
take place in about two months. They
say that in view of prospective co
operation between American soldiers
and Carranzista forces the hunting
down of the bandit groups in Chihua
hua and Durango scarcely can tako
more time than that. Gii assurances
from General Carranza that the ban
dits are dispersed the northward
movement of American troops will at
tain full speed.
Meantime, it was pointed out, there
would be constant movements north
ward oJ' American detachments, bo
that at the final order? for Withdrawal
there would lie only a part of the pres
ent expeditionary force left in Mexico.
General Obregon, it is understood,
is pledged to throw every available
man of his military strength into the
hunt for the marauding bands. It is
believed that almost all the 25,000
men suggested by General Carranza
as a Mexican lxirder patrol, in case
the American Government consented
to withdrawal, will be utilized in tho
campaign. Th.e American force will
block effectually any flight northward
of the bandits.
