The enormous total of between
seventy-five and eighty cars tt
lumber and shingles from What
com county mills is being handled
by the three railroads serving this
territory and the prospects are that
this will be Increased shortly. On
the Great Northern between .bi'ty
ftve and forty cars are handled
daily, on the Northern Pacific about
twenty, and on the Bellingham I
Northern about fifteen.
The L. T. L. will meet next Tues
day afternoon at the old school
building after school.
MAY NOT REBUILD
BIG LUMBER MILL
Whether or not Roo and Van
Leeuwen will rebuild their big lum
ber mill north of Lynden win r.
was totally destroyed by fire Sun
day afternoon, is still in doubt
Ralph Roo said last night that
no decision had yet been made ps
to the company'B plans.
"We don't know Just what we
tra going to do yet," said Mr. Roo.
At this time, however, we want
to tell our neighbors and the men
who came to help us from all over
the Lynden district, how grateful
we are for their generous aid. Their
assistance enabled us to save a o'g
share of our lumber, and prevented
no small additional loss. We can
not thank them enough."
Fire crept from the tai'ings to
ihe mill Sunday afternoon, end
when the blaze was diseove-ed
shortly after two o'clock, the plant
was ablaze beyond control. An
alarm spread through the dlstilct,
md scores of men hurried to help.
The mill was totally destroyed,
i.getber with the office bul'ding
and another dwelling. The dry
kiln and between 250,000 and 300.-
--000 feet of finished lumber was
burned. Good work on the part
>f the volunteers saved a large
;>art of the rough lumber.
Although no exact estimate has
•j€en made of the loss, it will prob
atly reach $20,000. No insurance
was carried. The loss of lime at
this season, in which there is a
brisk demand for lumboi, will also
mean a considerable loss to tho
company.
Lynden will feel the absence of
tho mill to no small degree, as
iifty men were on the company's
;iay rolls, and others were einploved
for hauling and similar Jobs.
