President, After Conference
With Secretary Baker,
Says. Agreement Reached
By Conference at Border
is "Satisfactory."
Does Not Stipulate Time For
"Withdrawal of American
Troops and Allows Army
Use of Railways in Mexico
Territory. .
"Washington, May 4 -Maor-General
Scott's report on his conference with
. General Obregon, Carranza's -war min
ister, laid before President "Wilson to
day "by Secretary Baker was charac
terized by President Wilson as "satis
factory." '.
' It Is understood to provide for the
use of Mexican, railways and sets no
: definite ; time such as .'60 days as.
has been reported, for the withdrawal
of Pershing's forces. .
After a conference with the Presi-
Gent, Secretary Baker said that no an
nouncement on, General Scott's report
t was - ready but' that the President
; might issue a; statement later.
. He indicated that a final decision on
all points had not been reached but
that General Scott would be Informed
so that he might have another con
' Terence with General Obregon.
While the terms' of the tentative
agreement have not been made public,
, it is understood to provide that Ameri
can troops shall not Jro farther south
i than they now are and will bew ith
drawn as soon as the Carranza gov
ernment convinces the United States
of its capacity to protect the Ameri
can border territory. .
It also provides . for co-operation
with Carranza troops for cleaning up
. the bandits. Some slight changes in
the agreement as made between Gen
eral Scott and General Obregon may
be made here tnf they probably will
' be unimportant. : The indications are
that Secretary Baiter will recommend i
to the President the acceptance or the
.agreement which Is described as
(purely a military one. . ' .
", El Paso. May 4 Ratification of the

Man Who Murdered Thomp

Her Father is Captured,
His Skull Fractured.
May Not Live to Face Trial
Relieved to Have Been
Beaten Before He Killed
s Girl's Father. '
Thompson, Conn.. May 4 John EI-v
liott, a farmhand, sought for two day
by posses as the alleged murderer of
Miss' Sybil Pettis, a school teacher,
and her father, George A." Pettis, of
this town, was captured hre early
today. ,
A farmer, Roland, Mills, found El
liott, heavly armed, in a barn where
he ha taken shelter from the rain.
Elliott was captured about a mile
and . a half from the scene of the
shoting. He was in a very weak and
exhausted condition and made no ef
fort to escape arrest. He was appar
ently in a stupor when Mills discov
ered him The latter ran to a. neigh
bor's house about a quarter of a, mile
away and notified Deputy Sheriff Wil
liam F. Bates, who placed Elliott un
der arrest. He was accompanied by
several armed men. i
One of the man's eyes was nearly
closed and he was cut about the 1 face
and head, indicating, it is thought,
that he may have had a struggle with
Pettis before shooting him. He was
apparently suffering from exposure
ana iacK or ioou.
It is now believed that at no time
was he very far -away. He has made
no statement of any kind.
When arrested he had on him two
automatic revplvers and one of an
ordinary type, between 50 and 60
rounds of ammunition and a small
sum of money.
Elliott was arraigned before Jus
tice of. the. Peace Randolph H. Chand
ler here later and was held without
bonds for trial in the superior court
at the September term on charges of
murder. When asked to plead Elliott's
ot1''" response was "nothing to say."
After an examination Of the pris
oner, physicians said that he would
probably - not live to stand trial as
there were indications of a fracture of
the skull. In addition to (his other in
juries, Elliott has a .-bad wound on the
bead and it is believed that when he
first- encountered Pettis as the latter
was at the ' woodshed, the farmer
threw an axei at him and struck him
on tfhe . head. The axe was, f oundysome
distanoe from the shed after the shoot
ing. Elliott would make no statement
of any kind, declaring his mind waa
blank as to what happened- after his
fight with Pettis. ' ... f
Further details of the capture of
Elliott show that wflien the farmer
saw the man- sitting under the shed
he went back to the house and his
wife went to a neighbor's for help.
Meantime, Elliott had aroused himself
from his stupor and going to the door
of the house asked for something to
eat. He then went to the well to draw
water and while he was there Deputy
Sheriff Bates, accompanied by half a
dozen armed men, arrived and placed
him under, arrest.
The prisoner was taken, to the coun
ty jail at Brooklyn to await trial. The
funeral of the victims was .held today.
Rev. John K. Moore of the CongregaV
tional church officiating.
State's Attorney Searles intimated
today that if the prisoner's condition
permitted, an early date for the trial
might be fixed.

Eviction proceedings brought in the
city court against Dr. Jacob Schwartz
operating handsomely appointed den
tal - offices i at Fairfield avenue and
Main street by his mother Mrs. Em
ma Schwartz, of Yonkers, confirm the
old adage that the course of true love
is never smooth.
The proceedings, preliminary notice
of which were served1- yesterday by
Deputy Sheriff Joseph Steigler,' are"
brought through Attorney Theodore
E. Steiber. Dr. Schwartz has retain
ed Attorney Thomas M. Cullinan to
defend the action. It is believed that
a settlement will be effected;.
The offices which are at present In
dispute are located on the second floor
of the United Building in the heart
of the city. They were opened nearly
a year ago by the dentist who in part
nership with Dr. Adolph Hartstein
practiced under the trade name of
United Dentists. ( Mrs. Schwartz holds
the lease ' for the floor in her own
name.
Several months ago Dr. Hartstein
withdrew from the business and open
ed offices elsewhere. Dr. Schwartz
continued practice.
During his residence in this city
Dr. Schwartz met Miss Lillian Graves,
youngest daughter of Samuel S.
Graves, the Fairfield ayenue jeweler,
living at 2475 Main street. The at
traction soon ripened into love.
Three weeks ago the couple were join
ed. In matrimony under the Jewish
rites.
Though Mrs. Sehwartz was present
at the ceremony, -differences of opin
ion soon widened. ' The breach be
tween mother and son, and caused
Dr. Schwartz and his bride to take up
their abode at the Graves home in
-this city where they now are domi4

Matters of business dispute contin
ued to a ptage where Mrs. Sehwart
placed the disposition.- ?f her lease in
the. hands of her- attorney with in
structions to bring summary proceed
ings against her son asking that he
vacate the suite.
Dr. Schwartz- deprecates the action
and persists in the belief that a. set

few days. ' Mr. Graves is likewise
astounded at the action, and is under
the impression that; the action will be
withdrawn. '

Vigorously Fights Petition
of Thomas Low.
The attempt of Thomas Hill' Low A
of New York to depose Carl Siemon as
Receiver for the R. P. K. Pressed
Metal Co. of this city, was vigorously
opposed in the superior court this af
ternoon' by Judge Carl Foster,, repre
senting Siemon. Low, who -was ap
pointed receiver for . the company in
New York state, claims Siemon's acts
should be declared null and void and
that the company's assets sold to the
Bridgeport Metal Goods Co., should be
turned back.
Counsel for Siemon argued that the
company's assets and factory were in
this state-although the company waa
legally a New York corporation. He
said Siemon has been -appointed re
ceiver by Judge Williams in '1915. At
that time the' company's assets were
greater than the liabilities but there
was no cash and no credit could be
procured. ,
There was some stock worth about
$15,000 on hand. After running the
business for several months Receiver
Siemon sold the business to the
Bridgeport Metal Goods Co for $20,
500. At the present time he has about
$22,000 of the company's funds. As
every action had been taken with the
court's' approval counsel for Siemon
said he say no reason why Low should
be allowed to take Siemon's place..
Judge E. K. Nicholson, ; represent
ing Low, saicTthe receivership papers
had never been served on the R. P. K.
