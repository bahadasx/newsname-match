CHAN UP WEEK
ISNEXI WEEK
CITY COMMISSION COMMITTEE
WANTS CO-OPERATION OF
EVERY PROPERTY OWNER
ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE OUT.
Clean up week means:
Increased property value.
Reduced insurance premiums.
Better health.
Better Babies.
Better Civic Spirit.
Next week is Clean-Up Week in Mi­
not, and everybody is respectfully
urged to do his full share to wash Mi­
nors face. Let us have the cleanest
and sweetest city in the state. This
can be done easily with just a little
co-operation. The large institutions
of the city are hand and glove with
the city commission committee. They
will set the pace, but the smaller prop­
erty owner must do his share also.
The Chinese are a wise old people.
They have a custom of paying their
doctor by the year. And the payment
is not made with the expectation that
it will cover so many "visits" in sick
ness. No. The doctors are paid to
keep their patients well every day. If
they fail—if the patient falls sick—
the doctor is held responsible and his
Eer
ay is reduced according to the num
of visits he has been compelled to
make.
In something like 5,000 cities and
towns in the United States, the people
have become almost as wise as the
Chinese. They have made up their
minds that it is better to spend one
week a year, and a little money, in
ridding their communities of the dirt
and refuse that breeds disease, than
it is to pay doctors to banish the di­
sease after it has secured a grip on
their bodies. Needless to say, the
doctors, in spite of the fact that a
Clean-up Movement means less busi­
ness for them, are the strongest work­
ers for and in it.
A certain small city in Missouri has
only two miles of paved streets, and
these were a continual eye-sore, be­
cause they were always covered with
dirt and the city had no money to pro­
vide a sprinkler. The women of the
city persuaded the city fathers to let
them handle the situation, with the re­
sult that they sold $100 worth of the
dirt and had the rest carted away to
fill the low places in the cemetery.
With the $100 they purchased a sec
ond-hand sprinkler. And what is the re­
ward of a Clean-up Week?
First, a clean town instead of a
dirty one. You have no idea how dis­
gracefully dirty your town is until
you begin to dig around in the cor­
ners. In Washington 4,500 tops of
rubbish were carted away to the city
dump during the Clean-up Campaign.
Second, lower fire insurance prem­
iums. In Philadelphia in 1914, the
fire loss from accumulation of rubbish
and combustible materials was more
than $300,000. Cincinnati reduced its
annual fire loss more than $600,000 by
its Clean-up Campaign—which means
a reduction of from 5 to 8 per cent on
the insurance rates in the business dis­
trict.
Third—better health. Industrial
tuberculosis kills more people every
year than are killed in mine fires and
boiler explosions, with railway collis­
ions thrown in. Industrial tuberculo­
sis comes chiefly from disease-carry­
ing dirt. You can actually reduce the
death rate in your town by a Clean-up
Campaign.
And finally, the proper kind of a
Clean-up and Paint-up Campaign
means a rebirth of civic spirit and
ride in your city. In one town in
'owa every citizen in the community
painted his house during Clean-up
Week except one. Every citizen got
a new enthusiasm for his city—except
one.

COUPLE CHARGED
WITH WHITE SLAVERY
M. C. WILLIAMS AND MARGARET
KELLER HELD UNDER $1,000
BONDS TO APPEAR BEFORE U.
S. COMMISSIONER MAY 10.
M. C. Williams, who was recently
arrested in this city, charged with
receiving money from a prostitute,
was arrested by the federal author­
ities Saturday under the Mann act.
He will be given a hearing before
United States Commissioner R. E.
Hopkins, May 10. Williams is held
under an additional bond of $1,000,
which to date he has failed to give.
Margaret Keller, the woman who
accompanied Williams to Minot sev­
eral weeks ago, and who swore to the
complaint charging Williams with re­
ceiving money from a prostitute, was
arrested at Williston by Deputy U. S.
Marshal Thorwald Mostad Saturday,
and returned to this city. She has
also been held to the federal court
under $1,000, which she has been un­
able to furnish, and will be given a
hearing before Commissioner Hopkins
May 10. She is also charged with the
violation of the Mann white slave act.
The former charge against Williams
be dropped and it ia

that both himself and the Keller wo­
man will be tried in the federal court.
Williams, the Keller woman and a
St. Paul girl, Stella Louise Elbert,
who is said by her mother to be only
fourteen years of age, appeared in Mi­
not several weeks ago, putting up at
one of the hotels. The girl's mother
and a St. Paul detective tracked the
trio to Minot and caused their arrest.
While there is no evidence that Wil­
liams and the Keller woman caused
any harm to befall the beautiful St.
Paul girl, it is said that the trio oc­
cupied the same bed at the hotel. The
girl was .taken back to St. Paul by her
mother, but she will be returned to
Minot as a witness.
The Keller woman claims that when
she and Williams were ready to come
west, the girl accosted them on the
street and said that she wanted to ac­
company them. The woman declares
that she had secured transportation
thru an employment agency for her­
self and a young woman who could not
come and that the Elbert girl rode
on that ticket. The story appears
rather fishy. Another report has it
that Williams became acquainted with
the girl as she was coming out of
high school, when Williams picked up
the pocketbook which the girl drop­
ped.
The Keller woman declares she was
on her way to Poplar, Mont., to work,
but that her funds ran low and she
stopped to earn money on the way.
POPULAR CANDIDATE
FOR COUNTY COM'R
M. O. OFSTHUN, MARYLAND
TOWNSHIP FARMER, IS THE
ONLY CANDIDATE WHOSE AN­
N O N E E N A S E E N
MADE.
Martin O. Ofsthun, a prominent
Maryland township farmer, is the
only candidate so far for commissioner
from the Second District, Ward coun­
ty. Two others have considered en­
tering the field, but to date have made
no formal announcement.
Mr. Ofsthun has resided in Mary­
land township for fifteen years and he
has been quite successful. If elected
M. O. OFSTHUN.
commissioner, there is no question but
what he will give the business of the
county the same careful attention that
he,has his own.
Mr. Ofsthun stands well wherever
he is known. He is planning on vis­
iting every portion of the district and
there seems to be little question as to
his securing the nomination.
Mr. Ofsthun is well qualified for the
position. He graduated from the
Glenwood, Minn., Academy years ago.
He has taken a great interest in town­
ship affairs, holding various offices.
For years he has been president of
the Surrey Farmers' Grain Associa­
tion, a successful institution.
Pleased With the New Era.
Thos. F. Kavanaugh of this city,
who represents' a large manufacturing
concern in this district, has just pur­
chased a New Era car from R. N. Al­
len, manager of the Western Sales
Co., who are distributors of the Stutz,
Madison and New Era cars, making
his first trip with it on Tuesday of
this week, to Kenmare.
He states that he made the trip in
four and a half hours, going by way of
Berthold and stopping there for din­
ner, then to Carpio to make a call on a
friend, from there to Aurelia, making
a short stop, then to Donnybrook,
making another short stop, then on
to Kenmare.
He considers this very good time,
taking into consideration the condi­
tion of the roads, as there are several
stretches of very rough and muddy
roads. What appealed to him most
was the mileage per gallon of gaso­
line, as he used only 3 1-2 gallons on
the whole trip.
Rubber Boots Ten Years Old.
A Minot merchant disposed of two
pairs of rubber boots that he has car­
ried in stock for the past ten years.
Both were small sizes, one pair for a
man and the other for his better half,
who reside in the flood district. The
merchant explained that they were
probably not much good and sold them
at a
OPERATION.

BOND LUMBER CO. BOUGHT VAL­
UABLE PROPERTY AND WILL
SOON HAVE LARGE YARD IN
The Bond Lumber Co. closed a deal
the first of the week for the Carroll
livery barn and lot and the Robb prop­
erty on Mill street, 150x250 feet in all,
and by the 15th of May or the 1st of
June will have a large, up-to-date
lumber yard in full operation.
The company has been contemplat­
ing installing a yard in this city for
several years, where the general of­
fices have been maintained. The yard
will be.one of the best in this section
of the stdte, being modern in every
way. The old Carroll barn will be re­
moved and a fine new office building
with large sheds will be constructed.
The Bond Lumber Co. operates yards
at Surrey, Sawyer, Deering, Bantry
and Bartlett and will thus do in ad­
dition to a retail business a large
wholesale business.
The company will build a number of
modern dwellings in this city for sale
or rent.
Carl Cox of Surrey, who has had
charge of the Bond Lumber Co.'s busi­
ness at that point for years, will be
in charge of the Minot yard and the
many friends of the Cox family will
be glad to learn that they are to lo­
cate here.
Quick Work.
Leland Barlow, who drives a wagon
for the White Ice Cream Co., became
ill of appendicitis suddenly Tuesday
and within an hour and a half he had
submitted to a successful operation
at the hospital.

FRIENDS SAY BROODING KILLED
C. O. SYLVESTER, WHO WAS
ACQUITTED OF UXOCIDE.
Mandan, May 2.—That Conductor
Charles O. Sylvester, of the Northern
Pacific, who died at the railroad's hos­
pital at Glendive, Mont., Monday
evening, died of grief and brooding
over his troubles more than any phy­
sical ailment is the statement of fel­
low employes.
It was about a year ago that he
faced trial at Dickinson on a charge of
shooting and killing his wife. After
being acquitted, he resumed his work,
but nas failed steadily. An operation
for ulcer of the stomach and gall­
stones showed not a defect. Mrs.
Sylvester was shot and killed during
a quarrel with her husband at Bel
field. The defense proved the killing
accidental.
Threshing Crews at Work.
Several young men who have been
looking for work in the city, left yes­
terday for Carpio, where they have
beeri assured twenty days' work at
threshing. A good many of the wheat
fields went unthreshed last fall be­
cause of the enormous crops, and the
roads are just getting into condition
so that machines may be moved.
CARD OF THANKS.
We wish to extend our thanks to
the neighbors and friends for the aid
rendered us in the sickness and death
of our husband and father also to
Rev. Richmond for the comforting
talk he made and for the flowers that
were sent.

denly stricken by paralysis and he de­
clined rnpidly until death.
Short funeral services were held at

Grading Contest May 5.
The grading contest which has
caused a good deal of talk all spring,
will be pulled off just east of the city
Friday, May 5. Three grader con­
cerns, the Russell Grading Co., The
Austin Western Co. and the Adams
Co., have entered the contest and will
be on deck with their grading machin­
ery. Ward county will furnish the
gasoline required to operate the trac­
tors and a mile of highway will be
graded. The contest will attract a
large crowd and the county fathers
will learn a good deal about grading
machinery, which will enable them to
spend the county's money more judic­
iously.
Hecker Back From Florida.
Geo. Hecker has returned from a
visit to Florida, whe're he spent sever
al weeks. Mr. Hecker is so well pleas

When a county official has been tried

tion and the chances are that he will
be returned'without any fight.
He is a level headed businessman.
He has been successful in managing
his own affairs and he has been just
as careful in conducting the affairs of
the county. Not only is he a good
man for the First district, but he ap­
pears to have the interests of the
county as a whole at heart. The vot­
ers of the First district will make no
mistake in returning Mr. Vandenoever
to office. The Independent will have
more to say concerning his record
later.
The New York Furniture and Hard­
ware store has a new Ford auto de­

David Gibb, the Sanish liveryman,
drove to this city Saturday in a car,
bringing a number of people who
filed on the reservation coal lands.
Mr. Gibb was the guest of his sister,
Mrs. C. F. Truax, while in the city.
G. W. Beatty of this city has opened
a cafe at Wolf Point, Mont. G. W. is
one of the best caterers in the country
and Wolf Point is mighty fortunate in
having an establishment of this char­
acter in such capable hands. He was
in the city the first of the week get­
ting his effects in shape to move to
the Montana city.
W. G. Stoll returned Wednesday
from a week's trip thru Montana. He
says that seeding is practically all
done in Montana and business condi­
tions are in first class shape. He re­
ports many excellent business oppor
tnuities open to a good live man with
a little capital. Many who have prov­
ed up their claims are selling out and
some good homesteads can be picked
up cheap.
I have an inquiry for a good im­

SECTION
WHO WILL
PAY ELECTION
INTERESTING QUESTION ARISES
FROM THE RECENT ELECTION
WHEN PARK COMMISSIONER
WAS ELECTED.
An election was recently held in the
city of Minot. A park commissioner
was elected. The election was held in
each ward and the election inspectors
are at present whistling for their pay,
amounting to something like $40.
A presidential primary election was
held at the same time. The law states
that the townships must pay for the
presidential primaries. No city elec­
tion was held, therefore the county
commissioners turned down the bills
of the inspectors. The city has "pass­
ed the buck" to the park board, but
that body declares that it should not
stand the expense of the election for a
park commissioner could have been
elected just as well by opening but one
polling place at the city hall. And
there you are.

Six schools will be represented at
the High school track meet held on
the Normal school athletic field at 2
o'clock, Saturday of this week, en­
tries numbering over 40. Towns rep
resented are Anamoose, Berwick, Bow
bells, Velva and Minot. Judging from
the number of entries from some of
I these towns they are sending teams
determined to wrest the honors from
the Minot High school.
For the declamatory contest in the
evening of Saturday, May 6, there are
entries from Berwieh, Anamoose,
Bowbells and Minot.
The prizes won at both the contests
will then be awarded. In addition
there will be several musical numbers.
These inter-high school contests are
under the management of the Normal
school. The declamatory contest is
directed by Mrs. Perkett and the ath­
letics by Mr. Altmann.
The Hazlett lectures will be given
this year by Dr. Lynn Harold Hough,
Professor of Historical Theology in
the Garrettt Biblical Institute at Ev
anston, 111. Dr. Hough is a thorough
theological student, being a graduate
of Scio College and from Drew Theo­
logical Seminary, with graduate work
in the University of New York, and
universities of Europe. He is also an
author of many books, and is in pop­
ular demand as a lecturer on varied
topics.
Dr. Hough will give two addresses
in the Methodist church on the even­
ings of May 9th and 16th. He will
speak at the Normal school on the
morning of May 9, 9:40 o'clock, and
also at 9:40 o'clock, Wednesday morn­
ing, May 10.
His subjects will be "The Making of
a Captain." "The Strategy of the
Cross," "The Dynamic Religion," "The
Capture of the World."
No admission is charged for any
of these addresses as the Hazlett lec­
tures are supported by Mr. and Mrs.
T. L. Hazlett, formerly of Valley City,
and now living at Long Beach, Calif,
who have provided for the permanent
endowment of the lecturship. By this
act of generosity the eminent speakers
brought to the state year after year
are presented to the educational in­
stitutions free of charge.
Dr. Hough is a worthy successor to
the notable men who have appeared as
Hazlett lecturers during the years
since the foundation was provided.
STENERSEN LOCATES
AT
MINOT ATTORNEY FILES ON
VALUABLE LAND NEAR RES­
ERVATION TOWN AND WILL
OPEN LAW OFFICE AT PAR
SHALL.
V. E. Stenersen, who drew No. 15,
for the Berthold coal land, has filed on
a valuable quarter five miles south of
Parshall, joining the farm selected by
Charles R. Porter, who drew No. 1.
Land in that vicinity has been selling
for $5,000 a quarter.
Mr. Stenersen will go to Parshall
at once to open a law office. He is a
very able attorney and will no doubt
have a nice practice in the hustling
reservation town.
Mr. Stenersen came to this city
about ten years ago and attended the
public schools, graduating from the
Minot high school. He received his
B. A. degree at Macalester College
and graduated from the law depart­
ment of the University of Minnesota.
Mr. Stenersen was assistant state's
attorney of Renville county for several
years and for the past two years he
has been practicing in Minot.
Mrs. Stenersen is a graduate of the
law and academic departments of the
University of Minnesota as well.
