WOMEN SHRINK
M f
Bear Grevious Ailments Rather
Than Make Condition
Known.
The subjects of complaints pe
culiar to women is a delicate one,
yet it is a plain duty to let these
sufferers know that most of the
derangments from which they
suffer are due primarily to ner
vous debility.
Many a suffering woman, in
fluenced by shrinking modesty,
has borne this grievous condition
without complaint rather than
make a personal appeal. When
many women say, I am all run
down, so nervous and weak."
that means they are victims of
the modern malady.
Such women, and they are a
egion in every community, suf
fer from headaches, backaches,
loss of appetite and' sleepless
ness. Their spirits are always
depressed and their lives are not
the normally happy ones of their
more fortunate sisters. Often,
too, there are spells of nausea,
weakness, or even fainting, that
make them feel insecure and to
wonder when they will be em
barrassed, or even in danger, be
cause of their condition.
For such suffering women Tan-
Jac, the tonic, tissue builder, ap
petizer and invigorant, is ideal.
Tanlac builds up the system, pro
motes digestion and proper as
similation of food, vitalizes the
blood and brings back healthy
color to the cheeks and real
sparkle to the eyes.
Tanlac may now be obtained
in Marion at the J. H. Orme
drugstore, where its merits are
fully explained.
Tanlac may be obtained in the
following nearby towns:
Blackford, A. T. Brown; Wheat-
croft, Hardin Pharmacy; Clay,
Kearney blue; Providence, R. G.
Bay n ham: Sturgis. Meacham &
King; Caseyville, W. E. Ames;

W. Guess; Princeton, Wylie &
