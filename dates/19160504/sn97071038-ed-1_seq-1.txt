dustry. The Morrow County Fair Board Is
arranging (or a competitive Judging
contest in all the departments (or the
coming Fair. The pupils of the var
ious schools in the county will be
given score cards and allowed to
judge the entries on the first day of
the fair; on the second day the reg
ular Judge will pass on the entries
and then take up the pupils' score
cards and tell them of the mistakes
and score the articles In their pres
ence. F' mers and others interested
will be in this way given an oppor
tunity to see the weak points In their
exhibits. The judges will also give
lectures on the various exhibits,
showing wherein they may be im
proved, 'i n is applies to livestock as
well as other exhibits. Suitable
prizes will be awarded to the school
that scores the highest number of
points In the scoring contest. Pres
ent Indications are that the exhibits
at the coming fair will be much bet
ter than ever before and it is the in
tention of the Board to make this
fair the most educational fair ever
held in the county. While the board
is limited in the amount of money
they can award In premiums they are
going to be as liberal as possible and
hope to have a large entry list of live
stock, especially dairy cows and
sheep. The board is arranging for
an entirely new set of attractions and
will give the people the best free at
tractions of any county fair in the
state. This is a big promise but the
board has always made good on its
promises heretofore and will this
time.
One thing the board would like to
mention at this time is that while
Morrow county Is a large producer of
wool and Heppner the largest pri
mary wool shipping point In Ore
gon, at the fair last year only five
fleeces of wool were on exhibit and
none of the five were first class wool
nd none were in good shape for ex
hibit. W would like to have the
sheep men save out two or three of
the best fleeces when they shear and
"have them on exhibit at the fair. This
would also be educational, as you
would have a chance to find out the
weak "points in your wool and also
materially assist the fair board In
putting out an exhibit of one of the
principal products of the county.
The wool will be taken care of and
safely returned to the owners. The
Morrow County Fair belongs to the
people of Morrow county and It will
be just what you want it to be. What
you want it to be will be told by the
Interest you take in the fair. If we
will all work together and do our
best to make this the best fair held
In the state regardless of the size of
the other counties we can win. We
won Sweepstakes over twenty-two
counties at the Land Show at Port
land Inst year and we can do it again
if we try. We have a reputation to
sustain and cannot afford to lose that
rep.
We are thinking of adopting the
following for our slogan this season:
"When the roll is called I'll be there.
Where? At the Morrow County
Fair."
Begin now to make your plans to
be there and we promise you will
have the beat time of your life.
Yours for the best ever,

NEW MACHINE WILL ACT
UALLY KEEP THE BOOKS
The First National Bank has just
installed & machine that will actually
keep books. The Burroughs Adding
Subtracting Machine is the name of
this mechanical bookkeeper and It
will be used for making entries to the
bank's ledgers and writing up de
positors' statements.
To understand best what this ma
chine means to a busy bank one must
see it in actual operation. A great
number of checks naturally come in
to the bank daily and each must pass
through the regular channels. A
record must be made of each oue and
the account of each depositor must
be handled separately and accurate
ly. Before the advent of the machine,
the detail work of entering amounts
in the ledger and making out depos
itors' statements was a tiresome and
uncertain task. All checks had to be
listed separately and added up by
hand. All deposits had to be listed
and added and their total combined
with the customer's old balance.
When that was done the total of all
checks had to be deducted from the
sum of old balance and deposits to
determine the new balance.
With the new Burroughs, this
work is all done mechanically, except
the actual setting down of the figures
on the keyboard. And the balancing
of an account from old balance on
through checks and deposits to new
balance, is virtually handled in one
operation.
The operator first feeds the cus
tomer's old balance into the machine.
Then he sets down the amount of
each check ; enters the amount of the
deposit; and, after taking a spacing
stroke, depresses the operating bar
with the total key down and the cor
rect new balance is automatically
computed and printed in the right
hand column. The machine also au
tomatically prints the dates oposite
each list of checks and deposits, and
without any attention from the op
erator, sets each in the column in
which it belongs.
Another thing it does is to detect
overdrafts instantly, whether the op
erator notices them or not. When the
checks exceed the deposits and the
old balance, the machine automatic
ally locks and no results can be ob
tained until the lever controlling the
internal mechanism is placed in the
"subtract" position, when the over
draft is printed in the proper col
umn with an "OD" sign in red ink.
With the use of the machine the
First National Bank's books are kept
more neatly, accurately and efficient
ly than they could possibly be kept
by hand. The machine method cuts
out unnecessary labor and eliminates
mistakes.
In addition to posting the ledgers,
the Burroughs make3 out monthly
statements for depositors. Each state
ment shows all the checks and depos
its of the customer, together with the
balance he has In the bank at the end
of the month. Under this system each
customer's account is kept balanced

FOREST NOTES. -
It is estimated that automobiles
carried to the Grand Canyon Nation
al Park last year 20,000 persons,
while the number of persons to
reach the Canyon by railroad was
92,000, or five times as many as in
1914.
That wild burros in the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado are increas
ing rapidly is the report from a
ranger on the Tusayan National For
est, who says that the little animals,
in their search for forage, are finding
their way to the top in such numbers
as to be a nuisance. Acording to
the Forest Ranger, there are already
thousands of the animals in the
Grand Canyon from Supai to the
north of the Little Colorado.
Approximately 85 per cent of the
losses of cattle on the National For
est ranges due to poisonous plants,
is caused by tall larkspur. Death
camas, lupine, laurel, sneeze wood,
and rubber wood are responsible for
sheep losses from such cause, while
loco weed is the principal poisonous
plant affecting horses. Last year the
loss from these causes amounted to
about $300,000.
New York leads all other States
of the Union in lumber consumption,
with a total annual bill for timber of
all kinds of over $100,000,000.

The City of Heppner has now tak.

then renewed for one week.
Only two cards are allowed in one

regular rates.
All late copyright books shall be

all the time and a statement Is ready
for him at the. end of the month, or
at any time he wants it, on five min
utes notice. Moreover, he does no'
have to bother with bringing his pass
book to be balanced. Being made on
the machine and checked back with
the ledger sheets of which they are
an exact duplicate the statements
will of course be absolutely accurate.
This system is similar to that now
in use in the most progressive banks
in the country and marks another
step in the First National Bank's ef
fort to give the most complete and
satisfactory service to depositors.
